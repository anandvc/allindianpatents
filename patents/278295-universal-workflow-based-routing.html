[0001]	The present patent   application   claims priority  to   U.S.   Provisional   Patent<br>
Application No. 60/706,561, filed August 9, 2005, and entitled "Universal Workflow-Based Routing," the entire disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein. The present patent application is related to U.S. Patent Application No. 11  filed March 15, 2006, and entitled "Dynamic Customer Satisfaction Routing," the entire disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
[0002]	The present invention relates to customer service systems and call centers, and<br>
more particularly to a customer service and enterprise workflow management method and system that enables, among other things, handling and routing workflow items on a manual, semi-automated, or fully automated basis.<br>
2.	Description of Related Art<br>
[0003]	Workflow items take many forms, but are generally divided into two categories.<br>
First, there is the category of Time-Varying Media (TVM), which includes phone calls, e-mails, internet-based chats, voice messages, and other real-time and non-real time media interactions. TVM are workflow items to the extent that they often act as a trigger, or entry point, for subsequent work. Second, there is another broad category of workflow items dealing with the flow of documents or electronic transactions representing non-TVM tasks. These non-TVM items are often called Workflow Documents or Workflow Transactions. For example, these tasks are often associated with activities such as filling out a medical claims form, a loan application, or a trouble ticket.<br>
[0004]	TVM and Workflow Documents are often managed differently and with a<br>
disparate array of hardware and software. For example, TVM-based interactions are generally facilitated with the aid of telecommunications systems such as a Private Branch Exchange (PBX) or an Automatic Call Distributor (ACD), which route telephone calls from a Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) or the Internet (e.g.. Voice Over IP). In the case of phone calls, these are switched to customer service representatives ("agents") and afforded some value-added intelligence in routing based on pre-determined routing rules based on the caller's phone number and the number dialed. The number callers are calling from is referred to as an Automatic Number Identification (ANI) and the number they are calling is a Dialed Number Identification Service (DNIS). In general, these numbers can be extracted from the phone line in order to make a determination of how the call should be routed based on database look-ups wherein customer information is matched with ANI and DNIS to aid in the disposition of the call. Further to these routing decisions are data dealing with the skills that are possessed by the agents. By matching the skills of an agent coincident with the telephone calls that are coming in to a PBX or ACD, customer service can be enhanced by routing callers to the best-suited or best-skilled agent. This is in addition to the "default" treatment of routing calls simply based on the availability of agents. This skills orientation is referred to as skills-based routing.<br>
[0005]	Dealing  with  TVM-based  interactions  also  goes  beyond  the  switching of<br>
telephone calls. In addition to telephone calls, the same routing disciplines may be applied to emails sent by customers. The same can also applied to Web-Based Telephone CallBack requests and Web-initiated Chat sessions.   In fact, these communications, represented by a<br>
 <br>
plurality of media types can be handled with what's commonly referred to as a multi-channel or multi-media ACD and is described in commonly owned U.S. Patent Application No. 09/798,226, entitled "Call Center Administrator Manager," the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference in its entirety.<br>
[0006]	Likewise,  there  are  commercial  systems  available  for  handling  non-TVM<br>
workflow items such as Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) based forms, extensible Markup Language (XML) based documents, proprietary trouble tickets, order fulfillment forms, and a plurality of standard and non-standard order entry and supply chain-oriented tasks and associated documents. For example, the management of these documents and related tasks are offered as part of commonly available Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems, and Document Imaging systems, and Web Content Management (WCM) systems, and Learning Content Management (LCM) systems.<br>
[0007]	There are many ways the routing of documents can be automated or semi-<br>
automated. As with PBXs and ACDs that handle TVM-based interactions, Workflow Document systems such as those represented by CRM and Document Management industries can be programmed to route documents and other work items to knowledge workers. These knowledge workers may or may not also be characterized as "agents" as the workers associated in answering TVM-based interactions on a PBX or ACD.<br>
[0008]	While the means to route workflow items (both TVM and Workflow Documents)<br>
and tasks can be handled with disparate and dedicated platforms each suited to its particular task,<br>
it is nonetheless difficult to make the "life length" of a series of workflow tasks a seamless<br>
interaction. The seamless ness and cohesive flow of work items and tasks in any organization is a<br>
mark of efficiency. Such efficiency is associated with getting tasks performed easily and<br>
quickly. The ease with which these tasks can be completed equates to significant financial<br>
benefits for the enterprise. These financial benefits are realized as a result of getting each<br>
knowledge worker to produce more work or eliminating the need for more knowledge workers.<br>
[0009]	Take, for example, the workflows associated with handling a customer request for<br>
a loan and further approving that loan and ultimately delivering the item to the customer which<br>
was the original motivation for acquiring the loan. The request for the loan may be triggered as a<br>
result of a phone call from the customer (likewise that request may be triggered by e-mail, chat,<br>
etc.). Certain information may be gathered fiow the customer as a result of that interaction. The<br>
"content" of that interaction may include customer information such as the name, address,<br>
household earnings and other items required to start a loan approval procedure.<br>
[0010]	After the initial call (trigger event) has completed, it is a common practice for the<br>
agent to do a "wrap-up" procedure. For example, as a "wrap-up" procedure, the agent who dealt with the phone call may access a separate application, not associated with the PBX or the ACD, in which a form or other document is presented to the agent. The presentation of that form or document is typically managed by a separate application driven by a CRM or Document Management system. That form may be partially filled-out based on the data collected by the agent for further disposition by a supervisor or some other knowledge worker who does not necessarily take phone calls.<br>
[0011]	Subsequent to the originating call and wrap-up workfiow, other work items may<br>
be "spawned" as a result. For example, the original document may be routed to a subsequent knowledge worker or supervisor. For example, a credit check with a credit reporting agency may have to occur. This may be triggered automatically based on custom software in a CRM application, or this may be accomplished semi-automatically with the intervention of another<br>
 <br>
knowledge worker. Often, customized routing algorithms will determine the logic flow or passing of the document from one person to another. Software which is entirely separate from the PBX or ACD software may be used to define the skills and/or availability of workers to handle these work items.<br>
[0012]	Further still, a supervisor may be consulted with or may need to "touch" a<br>
document or electronic form in order to authorize the final disposition of the loan. The workfiow may continue in the form of sending a fax or letter or email to inform the customer that she has been denied the loan. Or a phone call may ensue to alert the customer of that disposition. On the other hand, the workflow may continue in the form of an acceptance, whereupon subsequent documents and work items are handled to order and ship the item to the customer if his or her loan is approved.<br>
[0013]	In this simple scenario, a complex workflow has been described. There may also<br>
be similar scenarios in which dozens of steps ensue and also involve four or five knowledge workers. However, the skills required or the priority of the customer, or the preferences of the customer, or the availability of the knowledge workers, or the work item preferences of the knowledge workers are not universally known, let alone universally considered in the hand-off off these work items from system to system. Such is the state of integration between TVM-based systems and non-TVM-based systems for managing workflow.<br>
[0014]	It is clear that there are some common elements in the handling of items<br>
associated with TVM and Document-related Workflows. The table below shows the relationships between these items from a workflow management perspective.<br>
■ I<br>
[0015]	This is by no means a comprehensive list, but is shown to accentuate the<br>
similarities in complexity and requirements between handling phone calls, emails, chats, etc. (TVM) versus Document-related work items. One way of looking at the difference between these two "worlds" is that TVM are typically customer-facing and document-related, or internal transaction-related work items are often not customer-facing and more related to fulfillment activities or sometimes back office activities. This is not to say that forms and electronic documents are not often used by customers. What's important to consider is that despite the similarities in the need to track workforce skills, customer data, and the routing of interactions and work items, completely disparate systems have been developed to support these activities. Attempts are routinely made to "integrate" these disparate systems, but the architectures and approaches to managing a phone call, let's say, versus routing a medical claims form inside of a healthcare insurance company are completely separate.<br>
 <br>
[0016]	This separation between the handling of TVM vs. non-TVM is costly and requires<br>
custom, one-off development to link these disparate systems together. An unfortunate outcome of the need to develop custom software to integrate these disparate systems together is an inherently inefficient flow of work. For example, many more "data dips" are often required. Multiple "routing engines" and software are often required for each workflow item. The negative impact, beyond the cost to acquire, program and maintain disparate systems, is a slower response time. These slower response times, as previously mentioned, are costly, but slower response times may also have a negative impact on customer service.<br>
[0017]	For example, slower response times may be manifest in having to ask the<br>
customer more than once to offer information that was not passed from one workflow process to another.<br>
[0018]	In addition, slower response time may also be manifest in the inefficient routing<br>
of subsequent work items to knowledge workers who may not have the requisite skills to efficiently handle the work item. This is often exacerbated owing to the fact that different parts of the workflow are associated with different control systems that may or may not have a skills-based reference point or may or may not have a means to share skills-based data between reference points.<br>
[0019]	In addition, slower response time may also be manifest in another workforce-<br>
related issue dealing with the motivation of each knowledge worker to process the transactions that are linked to their sense of job satisfaction. The is a school of thought generally embraced by contact center managers, for example, that the motivation and satisfaction of contact center agents has a direct and positive correlation to their own sense of satisfaction in completing certain tasks in favor of others. This has necessitated the likes of contests or bonus programs used to cajole the workforce into completing certain tasks in favor of others. For example, a contact center supervisor may offer tickets to a show or a gift certificate to the agent who completes the most number of outbound calls in a certain time period. Much thought and work is put in to creating, promoting and administering such a bonus programs. What is not intuitively obvious to practitioners with average skill in the art is that the development of workflow items and "pools" may be developed that allow workers to either automatically indicate work item preference or dynamically allocate work items based on criteria associated with individual or group preferences.<br>
[0020]	In addition,  slower response time may also be associated with a lack of<br>
cohesiveness on the priority of each customer and how that priority is dealt with across disparate systems and databases. For example, a caller may receive priority in the handling of an ACD interaction. But it is not necessarily the case that the workflow items "spawned" from that original transaction will receive the same priority as the priority afforded to the caller in the first place. If all of the workflow items associated with post-wrap-up work go in to the same "bin," then the call treatment on the front-end of the process is a moot point. In short, unless the enterprise can provide a consistent tie-in of priority to the entire life-length of the associated workflow, not only does slower response time have an impact, but this may manifest itself in the overall dissatisfaction of the customer.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0021]	The present invention overcomes the deficiencies in the prior art by providing,<br>
among other things: 1) a universal construct for intelligent "ACD-like" routing of all workflow items, regardless of type; 2) a universal construct for applying customer-specific priorities to<br>
 <br>
workflow items, regardless of type; 3) a universal construct for applying workforce-associated skills and related attributes to the routing of workflow items, regardless of type; 4) a universal construct for applying customer satisfaction-associated priorities to the routing of workflow items, regardless of type; 5) a universal construct for applying workforce-initiated preferences, both stored and dynamic, to the routing of workflow items, regardless of type; 6) a universal construct for applying thresholds to the number and type of workflow items already in queue and to use those thresholds as a means to prioritize workflow items in queue; 7) a universal construct for applying thresholds to the number and type of workflow items already being worked on by a specific agent or knowledge worker and to use those thresholds as a means to prioritize workflow items for that worker; and 8) a universal construct for the application of any other attributes which may facilitate the intelligent routing and disposition of any workflow item, regardless of type. The present invention also provides a service creation and administrative environment that allows for the management of the above processes.<br>
[0022]	In an embodiment of the invention, a method for facilitating a workflow template<br>
comprises the steps of: creating a workflow template associated with a workflow item, wherein<br>
the workflow template defines one or more trigger points for the workflow item; and linking the<br>
workflow template to a project. The one or more trigger points specifies an action to be taken<br>
with respect to the workflow item. The step of creating a workflow template may comprise the<br>
step of associating a Web page or VXML code to collect input from a party, wherein the party is<br>
a call center supervisor, call center customer, or a call center agent. The project can be a<br>
phone/IVR project, Web callback project, email project; chat project; or a combination thereof.<br>
The step of creating a workflow template may also comprise the step of defining one or more<br>
routing rules for the workflow item, which may be based on preference as identified by a<br>
supervisor or an agent or knowledge worker. The workfiow item may comprise a document.<br>
The step of linking can comprise the step of selecting an entry point and exit point to be applied<br>
to the workfiow template and selecting a CGI, JSP, VXML, XML, EDI, or HTML page/script.<br>
[0023]	In another embodiment of the invention, a method of workfiow-based routing<br>
comprises the steps of: executing a workflow template associated with a workflow item and at least one trigger point; and routing the workflow item in response to activation of the trigger point. The method may further comprise the step of generating a user interface in response to activation of the trigger point and/or querying input from a party in response to activation of the trigger point. The trigger point may be a key performance indicator trigger or a trigger for supervisor intervention. The workflow template may be linked to a project dealing with both time varying media and non-time varying media workflow template handling. The workflow template may be associated with a script selected from the group consisting of: XML, EDI, JSP, CGI, VXML, and a combination thereof. The trigger point may also comprise one or more skill-oriented triggers. The step of routing the workflow item may be dependent on an individual work item preferences and may be performed automatically based on an individual work item preference as defined by a supervisor or dependent on the individual work item preference of a specific agent or knowledge worker. The preferences may be arranged and presented to a workforce as a pick list allowing for selection of preferred work items.<br>
[0024]	In yet another embodiment of the invention, a workfiow document rendering<br>
method comprises the steps of: storing a workfiow template, and storing database pointer information to render the workflow template. The method may further comprise the step of associating one or more media types with the workflow template.<br>
 <br>
[0025]	In yet another embodiment of the invention, a system comprises:   a multi-media<br>
automatic call distributor for facilitating an interaction, and a server for routing a document associated with the interaction.<br>
[0026]	In an embodiment of the invention, one or more Workflow Templates and<br>
corresponding workflow attributes and trigger points are created. Such Workflow Templates are used to link to a customer priority or event-driven weighting mechanism for each workflow item or link to key performance indicator (KPI) specific triggers. These Workflow Templates are used to generate user interface views which will be used by agents, knowledge workers, supervisors and customers.<br>
[0027]	One advantage of the present invention is that it provides a universal construct for<br>
the intelligent routing of workflow items, thereby improving efficiency and decreasing costs.<br>
[0028]	Another advantage of the present invention is that it provides a method for<br>
defining and establishing a customer prioritization associated with a workflow item during the<br>
life-length of workflow item, thereby improving aspects of overall customer satisfaction.<br>
[0029]	Yet another advantage of the present invention is that it facilitates various media<br>
types (TVM and non-TVM) thereby providing a single platform for handling a multitude of<br>
incoming workflow items resulting in improved workflow efficiency and response time.<br>
[0030]	The foregoing, and other features and advantages of the invention, will be<br>
apparent from the following, more particular description of the embodiments of the invention, the accompanying drawings, and the claims.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0050]	Embodiments of the present invention and their advantages may be understood by<br>
referring to Figs. 1-18 and are described in the context of a robust workflow routing environment. Nonetheless, the improvements described herein are applicable to any type of environment where there is a need to facilitate routing workflow items (both TVM and Workflow Documents).<br>
[0051]	Fig. 1 illustrates a top level view of a workflow-based routing network 100<br>
according to an embodiment of the invention.   In sum, the network 100 facilitates the manual,<br>
automatic, and semi-automatic treatment of workflow items can be created.<br>
[0052]	In order to better understand the present invention, the network 100 is described<br>
as comprising three separate "zones," which together facilitate a workflow environment. These "zones" may be divided in a variety of ways and the exemplary embodiment shown in no way limits one of ordinary skill in the art from implementing the invention in another configuration. The three zones are referred to as an "Internet/User Zone" 110, a "Web/DMZ Zone" 130, and a "Network Zone" 150. It is important to note that these "zones" may be divided in a variety of ways and the illustrative embodiment in no way limits one of ordinary skill in the art from implementing the invention in another configuration.<br>
[0053]	The Internet/User Zone 110 comprises multiple interfaces 120A-E for call center<br>
agents, supervisors, and other authorized parties to access the network 100 and use telephone instruments 111 and 112 via a PSTN or an Internet Protocol (IP) network 166, and/or computers (not shown) to access database-driven information associated with customers, e.g., caller information history. It is not a prerequisite that agents have access to caller information history for the invention to be useful, but it is helpful for agents to have access to such. The Internet/User Zone 110 also implements access software for administrators to create Workflow Templates and Trusted Application linkages which will provide the routing instructions, triggers and other rules for the subsequent routing of workflow items as noted below. The Internet/User Zone 110 further implements access software that allows Supervisors to provide monitoring and coaching of both contact center agents and knowledge workers. Supervisors can also score agent and knowledge worker transactions and other workflow items in real time.  Supervisors can also<br>
 <br>
score agent and knowledge worker transactions and other workflow items off-line using templates that were created by the aforementioned administrator as described in U.S. Patent Application No. 11/ , filed March 15, 2006, and entitled "Dynamic Customer Satisfaction Routing." The Internet/User Zone 110 further comprises telephone instruments 113 and 114, computers (not shown) and/or other access terminals (not shown), wherein customers are able to access the network 100 in order to interact and/or "self navigate" through information stores, e.g., websites, and questionnaires, i.e., surveys, and also be able to interact with agents, knowledge workers and supervisors. Such interactions include, but are not limited to, telephone calls including VoIP calls, Web-initiated chats, email, and web callbacks. Users may also interact in other ways associated with workflows that would be subsequently handled by the enterprise. This may include, for example, the filling out of electronic forms or other documents which would then be routed by an ACD application that is part of the network. Telephone calls can be sent to other parts of the network 100 over, for example, a PSTN 115; a cellular network (not shown); a computer network 116 such as an IP network, the Internet, or a private computer network; the implementation of or connection to which are apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art. Computer-based interactions may be facilitated via protocols such as, but not limited to HyperText Transport Protocol (HTTP), Secure HyperText Transport Protocol (HTTPs), as well as Post Office Protocol 3 (P0P3) and Simple Mail Transport Protocol (SMTP) for email communications, the implementation of which are also apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
[0054]	Exemplary   interfaces   120A-E   include   an   Interaction   Manager   120A,   a<br>
Supervision Manager 120B, and an Administration Manager 120C. The Interaction Manager 120A, the Supervisor Manager 120B, and the Administration Manager 120C provide interfaces for the agent, a supervisor or the like, and an administrator, respectively, to interact with the network 100. In one embodiment of the invention, the interfaces 120A-C are browser-based applications. Interfaces 120D and 120E are further included to facilitate communication with respective database servers and user/callers opting to contact the call center via email, web chat, VoIP, web page forms, or other communication techniques facilitated through the IP network 116.<br>
[0055]	In an embodiment of the invention, the Web/DMZ Zone 130 comprises any<br>
combination of Web Servers 132, Domain Name Servers 134, and Email Servers 136 and other components to provide secure access and transport services for computer-based interactions such as Web-initiated chat requests, Web-initiated Call-back requests between customers and agents, between customers and supervisors, and between supervisors and agents. The Web/DMZ Zone 130 also provides a transport layer for administration, agent and supervisor screens such that agents, supervisors and administrators have secure access to databases containing customer information, contact center configuration, routing rules, key-performance indicator (KPI) templates and real-time information for the handling of interactions (real time and non-real time interactions). In at least one embodiment of the invention, the Web Servers 132 interact with a customer's computer, an agent's computer, a supervisor's computer, an administrator's computer, or a combination thereof, and associated software over HTTP or HTTPs as particularly shown in Fig. 8, which is described below. The Web Servers 132 may optionally store and transfer messages that are passed to and from the Network Zone 150, where the messaging between those elements is implemented by Transport Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP). Therefore, the Web Servers 132 in the Web/DMZ Zone 130 also act as translators between HTTP or HTTPS and TCP/IP.   This translation capability is in place to<br>
 <br>
provide easy and universal access to the interfaces 120A-E or other thin client applications in use by the agents, supervisors, administrators, and/or customers.<br>
[0056]	In an embodiment of the invention, the Network Zone 150 comprises one or more<br>
application servers 152, one or more workflow document servers 153, one or more database<br>
servers 154, one or more file servers 156, and one or more telephony servers 158.   These<br>
software-based servers are located in host computers connected to a TCP/IP bus 160, which is in<br>
turn connected to the email servers 136 and web servers 132 in the Web/DMZ zone 130.<br>
[0057]	Application servers 152 implement software that controls the flow of phone calls,<br>
e-mails, chats, and web call-back requests between customers and agents, and supervisors. The workflow document servers 153 act as specialized flle servers and store information including, but not limited to, Workflow Templates and media files associated with Workflow Templates. In addition, the workflow document servers 153 may contain database pointer information, so information stored in the database servers 154 can be used to render Workflow Templates and other user-facing data associated with Workflow Templates, The database servers 154 store information such as, but not limited to Workflow Template data, customer records, interaction history, application parameters, agent location data, agent skill data and information which links key performance indicators (KPIs) and customer satisfaction data to the treatment and priority of customer interactions. The file servers 156 in the network zone 150 are used to store media such as agent recordings, KPI templates, scripts, voice messages, chat transcripts and e-mail transcripts. The telephony servers 158, the implementation of which is apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art, offer control over the physical switching of phone calls whether they are "soft switch" phone calls used with Voice over IP gateways or PSTN-switched phone calls over switching cards housed in personal computers (PCs). For example, a telephony server 158 may facilitate Internet telephony implementing a signaling protocol, such as a Session Initiated Protocol (SIP), to establish, for example, an audio/videoconferencing session over the IP network 116. Alternatively, sessions facilitated by a telephony server 158 may implement H.323, which is a standard approved by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) that defines how audiovisual conferencing data is transmitted across networks. H.323 enables users to participate in the same conference even though they are using different videoconferencing applications.<br>
[0058]	Fig. 2 illustrates exemplary applications of an application server 152 within the<br>
network zone 150 of the network 100 according to an embodiment of the invention. For instance, the application server 152 comprises a host manager 202, a license server 204, a SNMP agent 206, a statistics server 208, a TCPAP bus 210, a scheduling server 212, an IM server 214, an ACD server 216, a chat server 218, an email distribution server 220, predictive server 222 and a placeholder for any new or later added server, 224. These applications are described in greater detail in commonly-owned U.S. Patent No. 6,697,858, entitled "Call Centers for Providing Customer Services in Telecommunications Network," and U.S. Patent Application No. 09/902,069, entailed "Call Center Administration Manager with Rules-Based Routing Prioritization," the entire disclosures of which are incorporated by reference herein. Such a combination of applications is exemplary only and does not preclude any other configuration based on, for example, any subset of these components.<br>
[0059]	Although not the primary focus of the invention, each application in Fig. 2 is<br>
briefly described to better understand it role in the overall network 100. Particularly, the host manager 202 provides a mechanism for file transfer protocol (FTP) to other application servers and as a proxy to a network manager and manages communications with client machines (e.g., of<br>
 <br>
the customers and/or agents and supervisors) interacting with the server 152. For example, the<br>
host manager 202 manages FTP sessions with the server 152. The license server 204 facilitates<br>
registration of the client machines and governs legal use of licenses. The simple network<br>
management protocol (SNMP) 206 agent manages SNMP-compliant devices within the network<br>
100 by sending messages, called protocol data units (PDUs), to the SNMP-compliant devices,<br>
which store data about themselves and return this data to the SNMP requesters. The statistics<br>
server 208 transmits statistics interaction histories to and from the databases 154. The TCP/IP<br>
bus 210 facilitates the transmission of data over a TCP/IP network. The scheduling server 212<br>
schedules certain events such as, but not limited to call menus for after business hours. The IM<br>
server 214 is an application that acts as a bridge between the Network zone 150 and the client<br>
applications. The automatic call distributor (ACD) server 216 stores agent skill information. In<br>
an embodiment of the invention, the handling instructions are based on one or more key<br>
performance templates as described below. The chat server 218 facilitates chat sessions with<br>
customers over, for example, the Internet. The email distribution server 220 facilitates and<br>
manages email communications among customers, agents, and supervisors. The predictive<br>
server 222 manages and assists automatic outbound call dialing for agents and/or supervisors.<br>
[0060]	Fig, 3 illustrates exemplary applications of a workflow document server 153<br>
within the network zone 150 of the network 100 according to an embodiment of the invention. For instance, the workflow document server 153 comprises a Short Message Service (SMS) Server 302, an EDI document server 304, a Communication Services Framework (CSF) XML server 306, a Web Content Management (WCM) server 308, a Template server 310, a Trusted Application server 312, and a new server 314, which is a placeholder for any new or later added server.<br>
[0061]	Fig. 4 illustrates exemplary tables configured within the database server 154<br>
according to an embodiment of the invention. These exemplary tables include, but are not limited to a Jobs-Related Workgroup table 402, Jobs-Related Priorities table 404, a Jobs-Related Skills table 406, and a Work Flow Definitions table 408. These tables 402-460 store information to facilitate the KPIs, KPI templates, and dynamic routing of customer interactions with the network 100 discussed herein.<br>
[0062]	The database server 154 further includes a Work Flow Trigger table 410, a<br>
Workforce Preference table 412, a Course Structure Format table 414, a Work Flow Template table 416, a Trusted Application Reference table 418, a Web Control Management table 420, a Quality Monitoring Scoring table 422, a Key Performance Indicator table 424, a Customer Satisfaction Input table 426, a Supervisory Input table 428, a Customer Satisfaction Routing table 430, a User table 432, a User Login table 434, a Predictive Login table 436, a User Status Duration table 438, a Quality Control table 440, an Interaction table 442, a History Action table 444, a Client History table 446, a History Routing Transfer table 448, a History Automatic Template table 450, a History Predictive Result table 452, a History Routing Workgroup tables 454-456, a History Routing Project table 458, and a History Outcomes table 460, the implementation of all of which are apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art. Such a configuration of tables is exemplary only and does not preclude any other configuration based on, for example, any subset of these components.<br>
[0063]	In general, tables 402-460 store three different types of data:   (1) information<br>
about the workforce, for example, agent skills and profiles, designated workgroups, and identification of supervisors; (2) business rules, for example, routing of customer inquiries and timing of events; and (3) historical information.<br>
 <br>
[0064]	Fig. 5 illustrates exemplary components of a file server 156 within the network<br>
zone 150 of the network 100 according to an embodiment of the invention. In general, the components can be differentiated between applications and resources running on the file server 156, and media stored on the file server 156. For instance, in an embodiment of the invention, the file server 156 includes applications: host manager 502, TCP/IP bus 504, a MPEG audio layer-3 (MPS) converter 506, and a document file type converter 508, the implementation of all of which are apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art. The MPS converter 506 is provided for storing audio into a relatively small and manageable digital file sizes. Nonetheless, alternative audio encoding schemes to MPS may be implemented.<br>
[0065]	The file server 156 further comprises storage for different types of media.<br>
Particularly, the file server 156 comprises a quality monitoring recording storage 510, an ACD chat transaction storage 512, an ACD email transaction storage 514, an IVR prompt storage 516, an ACD voice mail storage 518, an ACD fax message storage 520, a transaction recordings storage 522, other media storage 524, an SMS transcript storage 526, an EDI template storage 528, a CSF/XML document storage 5S0, and a template storage 5S2.<br>
[0066]	Fig. 6 illustrates an application view of telephony servers 158 within the network<br>
zone 150 of the network 100 according to an embodiment of the invention. Particularly, a plurality of applications/resources running on a telephony server 158 include, but are not limited to: a PSTN/VOIP gateway 620, a Softswitch telephony server 652, an IP network 116, a circuit switch telephony server 6S4, a PSTN 115, and a public switched telephone network elements 6S0. Communication links are established between the PSTN 115 and the IP network 116 via the Internet User Zone 110 comprising of the circuit switched telephone 111/113 and the VOIP device/telephone 112/114. Additionally, the fiow of PSTN two way traffic exists between the PSTN 115 and Public Switch 630, the Public Switch 630 and Circuit Switch 634, and the PSTN 115 and VOIP Gateway 620. IP traffic links are established between the VOIP Gateway 620 and the Softswitch 652, the Softswitch 652 and the IP Network 116, and the IP Network 116 and the Circuit Switch 634.<br>
[0067]	Each server and network in Fig. 6 are further comprised of additional resources.<br>
For example, resources that make up the Softswitch server 652 are comprised of the VOIP network interface 602, the conferencing resource 604, the matrix switching resource 606, and the media processing resource 608. Subsequently, available resources for the circuit switch 634 include the PSTN network interface 610, the conferencing resource 612, the matrix switching resource 614, the media processing resource 616, and the VOIP conversion 618. Finally, resources available for the public switched telephone network 630 include the local central dial office 619, the long distance access tandem 621, the private branch exchange (PBX) 622, the automatic call distributor (ACD) 623, the intelligent programmable switching device 624 and the VOIP gateway 625. Such resource configuration is exemplary only and does not preclude any other configuration based on, for example, any subset of these resources.<br>
[0068]	Fig. 7 illustrates a application and storage view of telephony servers 158 within a<br>
network zone 150 of the network 100 according to an embodiment of the invention. Particularly, applications and resources running within the telephony server 158 are comprised of the host manager 702, the TCP/IP bus 704, the redirect server 706, the music server 708, the unified messenger server 710, the call center servers 712/714, the Computer-Telephony-Integration (CTI) server 716, the CTI bridge 718 and the conferencing (MCU) server 720. The storage of media stored on the telephony server 158 includes the IVR prompt storage 722, the fax message temporary storage 724, and the voice mail storage 726.<br>
 <br>
[0069]	Fig. 8 illustrates a detail view of the Web/DMZ zone 130 of the network 100<br>
according to an embodiment of the invention. Here, the HTTP/Web servers 132 comprise a standard Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition (J2EE)/Web container 810, the implementation of which is apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
[0070]	As previously noted, the present invention facilitates the creation of Workflow<br>
Templates in a database 153 and also the designation of linkage between these templates and specific projects dealing with different media type handling. Workflow Templates are used to automatically generate user interface views which will be used by agents, knowledge workers, supervisors and customers. Likewise, Workflow Templates may trigger views associated with Trusted Applications. These trusted applications may be supplied by 3'^'* parties who use an API (Application Programming Interface), such as the Web Services API supplied by Telephony@Work, so electronic forms and other documents supplied by a third party can populate an agent, knowledge worker, supervisor or customers' computer screen. Such Workflow Templates provide the means to create, define and store the name and definition of and "trigger points" for each workflow item. Further, each template can be used to reference a weighting mechanism (importance level) for each workflow item. Further, each workflow item template can be used to link to KPI-speciflc triggers, such as routing triggers or triggers for supervisor intervention. Further, each workflow item template can be used to link to a customer priority weighting mechanism (importance level) for each workflow item. In addition, each workflow item template can be used to link to an event-driven weighting mechanism (importance level) for each workflow item having to do with the thresholds or "business" of various workflows. For example, the routing of a workflow item can be made dependent on the number of other work items already in queue for that item or associated items. Or the routing of a workflow item can be made dependent on the type and number of other work items being handled by a particular agent or knowledge worker. Furthermore, the routing of a workflow item can be made dependent on the skill level of a particular agent or knowledge worker or the skill requirements of different workgroups. Moreover, the routing of a workflow item can be made dependent on the stored or dynamic workflow item preferences of a particular agent or knowledge worker or the workflow item preferences, as illustrated in Fig. 18, of different workgroups. The Administration Manager interface is used to define the attributes and trigger points referenced here for Workflow Templates and trusted applications.<br>
[0071]	Triggers are actions based on pre-set parameters that occur as a result of certain<br>
events or thresholds being accomplished. Triggers may act as "entry points" or "next step" instructions for workflow. For example, TVM events can act as triggers because they often signal the passage of a certain event that then causes a next event in the workflow to occur. For example, the request for the loan may be triggered as a result of a phone call from the customer (likewise that request may be triggered by e-mail, chat, etc.). So the phone call coming in on a certain number or called from a certain number can be the basis for a trigger. After the initial call (trigger event) has completed, the agent might do a "wrap-up" procedure. So when the caller hangs up, that can be characterized as a "trigger event" that causes the wrap-up part of the workflow to ensue. Subsequent to the originating call and wrap-up workflow, other work items may be "spawned" as a result. So the wrap-up being completed may trigger a fulfillment activity and so on. Skills, workgroup requirements such as service levels, customer priorities, and workforce preferences may also be used as triggers. In short, any piece of data or workflow event that can be characterized and parameterized in the database can essentially be used as a trigger.<br>
 <br>
[0072]	Workflow Templates can be created as the basis for a workflow item that agents<br>
or knowledge workers or supervisors use. In addition, Workflow Templates can be created to be used by customers. The trigger points for when a document is used by a knowledge worker, let's say, versus a customer, are also determined when creating the template. Further, in creating a Workflow Templates the administrator can instruct the system to save scripts associated with the template that can be saved as XML, EDI, JSP, CGI, VXML, etc. so as to be able to automatically generate documents or logic flows consistent with the target media type for the anticipated interactions with customers.<br>
[0073]	Fig. 9 illustrates a process 900 of creating a Workflow Template and storing<br>
information relative to that Template in a Workflow Document Server and associated in a Database according to an embodiment of the invention. An administrator will use the Administration Manager interface, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 09/798,226, entitled "Call Center Administrator Manager," the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, to define Workflow Templates. The process 900 of creating a Workflow Template in a Database begins by the administrator logging on (step 901) to the administration manager application. The software asks (step 902) to specify a new or existing company for which the template is to be associated with. If the company is a new company, the administrator defines (step 904) the new company's attributes. If an existing company, the administrator selects (step 906) the company from a list of companies having information previously stored. The administrator is then asked (step 908) whether a new Workflow Template is being generated or an existing Workflow Template is being edited. If new, the administrator defines (step 910) the new template. If already existing, the administrator selects (step 912) the template she wishes to modify.<br>
[0074]	Each Workflow Template includes a number of workflow items.    For each<br>
workflow item, the administrator may define or edit the name (step 914) and then select and store names of each workflow item (step 916). The administrator may also define the Description of each workflow item (step 918) and then select and store the description of each workflow item (step 920). Once the description is defined, the administrator may proceed to build or reference the Workflow Template (step 922). If the administrator chooses to reference the Workflow Template, the referenced item may include a reference to a URL, executable, or query for launching a trusted application (step 926). If the administrator opts to build the Workflow Template, the administrator must select the appropriate fields, labels, and data sources for the Workflow Template (step 924). Once the Workflow Template is either built or referenced by the administrator, the next step allows for the administrator to store the Workflow Template attributes (step 928).<br>
[0075]	A customer-facing workflow item may be defined by the administrator (step 930).<br>
If the administrator chooses to define the customer-facing workflow item, the administrator must then select the presentation type for the customer facing item (step 934). If the administrator opts not to define the customer-facing item, only the presentation type for workforce-facing item is selected (item 932).<br>
[0076]	Customer-Facing Work Items, as the name implies, are work items and activities<br>
that a customer can see or hear. Workforce-Facing Work Items are work items and activities that are for internal use only. Customer-Facing Work Items include, but are not limited to: an IVR dialogue that a customer hears in routing their call or doing automation tasks, a web-based form for filling out a loan application, a web-based form for responding to a customer satisfaction survey, and a customer qualification form as a prerequisite to a chat dialogue. Workforce-Facing<br>
 <br>
Work Items include, but are not limited to:    a partially filled-out loan application from a<br>
customer that needs to be completed, a workforce-based preference pick list that allows an agent<br>
to select work items, a supervisor scoring screen that allows a supervisor to rate the activities of<br>
an agent, a trouble ticket that needs to be routed from an agent to a technical support person.<br>
[0077]	Once the presentation attributes are selected, the next step allows for the<br>
administrator to store the presentation attributes (step 936). The administrator then proceeds to link (step 938) each Workflow Template to KPI library and metrics, select authorized workgroups (step 942) for each Workflow Template, define skills and skills weighting (step 946) for each Workflow Template, and define project and workgroup entry/exit points (step 950) for each Workfiow Template. For each of steps 938, 942, 946 and 950, the administrator proceeds to select and store each item (steps 940, 944, 948, 952 respectively). Views for each workflow item may then either be defined by the administrator as "push" or "pull" (step 954). If the "push" view is selected, the administrator is then prompted to select an automatic workgroup/queue placement of workflow items (step 958). Alternatively, if the "pull" view is selected, the administrator is prompted to select the dynamic display of "picklist" view of workflow items. The administrator then proceeds to define worker and workgroup item (step 960) for each Workflow Template, define customer prioritization (step 964) for each Workflow Template, define workgroup related thresholds for routing (step 968) for each Workfiow Template, and define agent related threshold for routing (step 972) for each Workflow Template. For each of steps 960, 964, 968 and 972, the administrator proceeds to select and store each item (steps 962, 966, 970, 974 respectively).<br>
[0078]	After all of the elements related to each workflow item are defined and stored, the<br>
administrator may then proceed to end the Workflow Template provisioning process or continue to on defining additional options (step 976). If the administrator proceeds to end the provisioning process, then the Workflow Template is stored in the database (step 978). Alternatively, the administrator may proceed not to end the template provisioning process in order to add more options. Options available to the administrator include create page for supervisor input (step 980), create VXML code for supervisor input (step 983), create page for customer input (step 985), create VXML code for supervisor input (step 987), create page for worker input (step 989), and create VXML code for worker input (step 991). If any one of these options is selected, the administrator will be prompted to either select and/or store the document item (steps 984, 986, 988, 990 and 992). The Workflow Template provisioning process subsequently ends after the administrator has successfully completed the selection of options (step 993).<br>
[0079]	Figs.   10-13  illustrate processes  for linking Workflow  Templates  and  KPI<br>
Templates to specific media and/or project types according to at least one embodiment of the invention. For example, the Administrator can also use the Administration Manager interface to link Workflow Templates to specific projects and TVM. For example, the Administrator can associate a template with a phone call logic flow and further define whether the completion of a workflow may trigger a call or other follow-up to the customer. In another example, the Administrator can associate a Workflow Template with a Web-based chat project and further define whether the template should be made to trigger the pushing of an electronic form or other document to that customer in real time during a chat interaction. In another example, the Administrator can associate a template with a Web-based CallBack project and further define whether a Workflow Template and resulting workflow item can be associated with a scheduled call-back based on input from the customer. In another example, the Administrator can associate<br>
 <br>
a Workflow Template and resulting workflow item with an ACD email project and further define<br>
whether the template should be made to trigger pre- or post-e-mail input from the customer.<br>
[0080]	Referring again to Fig. 10, a process 1000 for linking a Workflow Template to a<br>
phone/IVR project starts after the administrator logs into the administration manager application<br>
and specifies or defines a particular company (step 901). The software asks (step 902) to<br>
specify a new or existing company for which the template is to be associated with. If the<br>
company is a new company, the administrator defines (step 904) the new company's attributes.<br>
If an existing company, the administrator selects (step 906) the company from a list of<br>
companies having information previously stored. Next, the administrator is prompted to select<br>
either a new or existing project (step 1002). The administrator will either choose to define a<br>
new project (step 1004) or select an existing project (step 1006). Once a project is made<br>
available, the administrator will be prompted to select a phone/IVR element (step 1008). If the<br>
administrator opts not to select a phone/IVR element, then the process proceeds to the Flow<br>
Chart for non-TVM Linkage (step 1010) as described in Fig. 14. Otherwise, the administrator is<br>
prompted to select the first Workflow Template from a drop-down list (step 1012). Entry/Exit<br>
points to be applied for the first Workflow Template must be selected by the administrator (steps<br>
1014/1018) and are subsequently stored (steps 1016/1020). Next, the administrator is prompted<br>
to select an additional Workflow Template from another drop-down list (step 1022). Entry/Exit<br>
points to be applied for the additional Workflow Template must again be selected by the<br>
administrator (steps 1024/1028) and are subsequently stored (steps 1026/1030).<br>
[0081]	After the entry/exit points have been applied to the Workflow Template, the<br>
administrator may choose to use text-to-speech (TTS) or pre-recorded speech (step 1032). If TTS is selected, the administrator is prompted to select "auto-generate" text-to-speech script for IVR (step 1036) while the program subsequently links TTS library to VXML document and/or IVR script (step 1040). Alternatively, if the pre-recorded speech is selected, the administrator is prompted to select pre-recorded prompts to play from down-down list (step 1034) while the program subsequently links pre-recorded prompts to VXML document and/or IVR script (step 1038).<br>
[0082]	The administrator may choose to define more media types or end the process (step<br>
1042). If the administrator decides to end the provisioning process, the project attributes are stored in a database and the provisioning process ends (step 1044). Otherwise, the administrator will be taken to the process for Workflow Template linkage to web callback (step 1046) as described in Fig. 11.<br>
[0083]	Referring to Fig. 11, a process 1100 for linking KPI templates to web callback<br>
projects starts after the administrator logs into the administration manager application (step 901) and specifies or defines a particular company. The software asks (step 902) to specify a new or existing company for which the template is to be associated with. If the company is a new company, the administrator defines (step 904) the new company's attributes. If an existing company, the administrator selects (step 906) the company from a list of companies having information previously stored. Next, the administrator is prompted to select either a new or existing project (step 1002). The administrator will either choose to define a new project (step 1004) or select an existing project (step 1006). Once a project is made available, the administrator will be prompted to select a web callback element (step 1102). Once the administrator selects a web callback element, the attributes are saved in a database (step 1104). Next, the administrator is prompted to select the first Workflow Template from a drop-down list (step 1012).    Entry/Exit points to be applied for the first Workflow Template must be selected<br>
 <br>
by the administrator (steps 1014/1018) and are subsequently stored (steps 1016/1020). Next, the administrator is prompted to select an additional Workflow Template from another drop-down list (step 1022). Entry/Exit points to be applied for the additional Workflow Template must again be selected by the administrator (steps 1024/1028) and are subsequently stored (steps 1026/1030).<br>
[0084]	After the entry/exit points have been applied to the Workflow Template, the<br>
administrator must select type of document to use for web callback document (step 1106). Next, the administrator may select either a CGI, JSP or HTML script (steps 1108, 1112, 1116 respectively) and then subsequently link, after each selection, the attributes to the appropriate script (steps 1110, 1114, 1118).<br>
[0085]	The administrator may choose to define more media types or end the provisioning<br>
process (step 1042). If the administrator decides to end the provisioning process, the project attributes are stored in a database and the provisioning process ends (step 1044). Otherwise, the administrator will be taken to the flow chart for Workflow Template linkage to web callback (step 1046).<br>
[0086]	The administrator may choose to define more document types or end the<br>
provisioning process (step 1120). If the administrator decides to end the process, the project attributes are stored in a database and the provisioning process ends (step 1044). Otherwise, the administrator may choose to define more media types or end the process (step 1042). If the administrator decides to end the process, the project attributes are stored in a database and the process ends (step 1044). Otherwise, the administrator will be taken to the process for Workflow Template linkage to email project (step 1122) as described in Fig. 12.<br>
[0087]	Fig. 12 illustrates a process 1200 for linking Workflow Templates to email<br>
projects and starts after the administrator logs into the administration manager application (step<br>
901) and specifies or defines a particular company. The software asks (step 902) to specify a<br>
new or existing company for which the template is to be associated with. If the company is a<br>
new company, the administrator defines (step 904) the new company's attributes. If an existing<br>
company, the administrator selects (step 906) the company from a list of companies having<br>
information previously stored. Next, the administrator is prompted to select either a new or<br>
existing project (step 1002). The administrator will either choose to define a new project (step<br>
1004) or select an existing project (step 1006). Once a project is made available, the<br>
administrator will be prompted to select an email template (step 1202). Once the administrator<br>
selects an email template, then the attributes are saved in a database (step 1104). Next, the<br>
administrator is prompted to select the first Workflow Template fiow a drop-down list (step<br>
1012). Entry/Exit points to be applied for the first Workflow Template must be selected by the<br>
administrator (steps 1014/1018) and are subsequently stored (steps 1016/1020). Next, the<br>
administrator is prompted to select an additional Workflow Template from another drop-down<br>
list (step 1022). Entry/Exit points to be applied for the additional Workflow Template must<br>
again be selected by the administrator (steps 1024/1028) and are subsequently stored (steps<br>
1026/1030). This process may be repeated for additional Workflow Templates.<br>
[0088]	After the entry/exit points have been applied to the Workflow Template, the<br>
administrator must select type of document to be linked to the email template (step 1204). Next, the administrator may select either a CGI, JSP or HTML script (steps 1108, 1112, 1116 respectively) and then subsequently link, after each selection, the attributes to the appropriate script (steps 1110, 1114, 1118).<br>
 <br>
[0089]	The administrator may choose to define more media types or end the provisioning<br>
process (step 1042). If the administrator decides to end the provisioning process, the project attributes are stored in a database and the provisioning process ends (step 1044). Otherwise, the administrator will be taken to the flow chart for Workflow Template linkage to web callback (step 1046), as described in Fig. 11.<br>
[0090]	The administrator may choose to define more document types or end the<br>
provisioning process (step 1120). If the administrator decides to end the provisioning process, the project attributes are stored in a database and the provisioning process ends (step 1044). Otherwise, the administrator may choose to define more media types or end the provisioning process (step 1042). If the administrator decides to end the provisioning process, the project attributes are stored in a database and the provisioning process ends (step 1044). Otherwise, the administrator will be taken to the flow chart for Workflow Template linkage to chat project (step 1206), as described in Fig. 13.<br>
[0091]	In Fig. 13, a process 1300 for associating a Workflow Template with a Chat<br>
project is illustrated according to an embodiment of the invention and starts when the administrator logs on (step 901). The software asks (step 902) to specify a new or existing company for which the template is to be associated with. If the company is a new company, the administrator defines (step 904) the new company's attributes. If an existing company, the administrator selects (step 906) the company from a list of companies having information previously stored. Next, the administrator is prompted to select either a new or existing project (step 1002). The administrator will either choose to define a new project (step 1004) or select an existing project (step 1006). Once a project is made available, the administrator will be prompted to select a chat template (step 1302). Once the administrator selects a chat template, the attributes are stored in a database (step 1104). Next, the administrator is prompted to select the first Workflow Template from a drop-down list (step 1012). Entry/Exit points to be applied for the first Workflow Template must be selected by the administrator (steps 1014/1018) and are subsequently stored (steps 1016/1020). Next, the administrator is prompted to select an additional Workflow Template from another drop-down list (step 1022). Entry/Exit points to be applied for the additional Workflow Template must again be selected by the administrator (steps 1024/1028) and are subsequently stored (steps 1026/1030). This process may be repeated for additional Workflow Templates.<br>
[0092]	After the entry/exit points have been applied to the Workflow Template, the<br>
administrator must select type of document to be linked to the chat template (step 1304). Next, the administrator may select either a CGI, JSP or HTML script (steps 1108, 1112, 1116 respectively) and then subsequently link, after each selection, the attributes to the appropriate script (steps 1110, 1114, 1118).<br>
[0093]	The administrator may choose to define more media types or end the provisioning<br>
process (step 1042). If the administrator decides to end the provisioning process, the project attributes are stored in a database and the provisioning process ends (step 1044). Otherwise, the administrator will be taken to the flow chart for Workflow Template linkage for non-TVM linkage (step 1046) as described in Fig. 14.<br>

[0095]	Fig. 14 illustrates a process 1400 of linking Workflow Templates to non-TVM<br>
documents according to an embodiment of the invention and begins when the administrator logs on (step 901). The software asks (step 902) to specify a new or existing company for which the template is to be associated with. If the company is a new company, the administrator defines (step 904) the new company's attributes. If an existing company, the administrator selects (step 906) the company from a list of companies having information previously stored.

Entry/Exit points to be applied for the additional Workflow Template must again be selected by the administrator (steps 1024/1028) and are subsequently stored (steps 1026/1030). This process may be repeated for additional Workflow Templates.<br>
[0096]	After the entry/exit points have been applied to the Workflow Template, the<br>
administrator is prompted to end the provisioning process or continue to next flow chart (step<br>
1404).      If the administrator chooses to complete the provisioning process, the workflow<br>
attributes are saved in the database (step 1104) and subsequently logged off (step 1406).<br>
Otherwise, the administrator is taken to the flow chart for other workflow items (step 1408).<br>
[0097]	Fig.  15  illustrates the Supervisor View of Workflow Document and Agent<br>
Performance according to an embodiment of the invention. Supervisors can score agent and<br>
knowledge worker performance (KPIs) based on the efficient handling of workflow items based<br>
on the Workflow Templates created in the second aspect of the invention. Such scoring will<br>
store values in the database which can be made to have an effect on subsequent routing decisions<br>
in TVM (phone calls, e-mails, chats, web call-backs) and non-TVM (electronic forms and<br>
workflow documents, see Fig. 14) for example, but are not limited to these workflow item types.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the Supervisor would use the Supervision Manager<br>
to select specific workflow items based on a plurality of search criteria including company,<br>
customer, agent, knowledge worker and specific workflow item. Further, the Supervisor would<br>
be able to select a specific workflow item based on the stored template mentioned above, and<br>
answer questions dealing with scoring and weighting the KPIs in question for that agent.<br>
[0098]	Referring to Fig. 15, a process 1500 of supervisor view of Workflow Templates<br>
and agent performance according to an embodiment of the invention and starts when the supervisor logs on to the supervision manager application (step 1502). The supervisor then proceeds to search for interaction to score (step 1504) where the supervisor may either select a worker or workflow item (step 1506). If a workflow item is selected, the supervisor is prompted to select a company (step 1510) and project (step 1514). If, on the other hand, a worker is selected, the supervisor is prompted to select a worker to score (step 1508) and the company (step 1512). The supervisor must then select a date range (step 1516) followed by selecting a specific workflow item (step 1518).   Selecting the specific workflow item includes loading the<br>
 <br>
KPI template (step 1520). Once the workflow item is selected, the workflow item is displayed/played for the supervisor to see or hear or both (step 1522). This step further includes finding the interaction in the database (step 1524).<br>
[0099]	Once the workflow item is displayed for the supervisor (step 1526), the supervisor<br>
may choose to select the appropriate KPI metric (step 1528) and score for KPI metric (step 1530) from the drop-down list. The supervisor may add subsequent KPI metric or choose to complete this step (step 1532). If no additional KPI metrics is selected, the scores are stored in the database (step 1534). Otherwise, the supervisor is given additional KPI metrics and score for KPI metrics to select from (steps 1536, 1538). The supervisor must next address workflow items that are either complete or incomplete (step 1548). For incomplete workflow items, the supervisor attempts to work to complete these items (1544) and again queried on whether the item is or is not complete (step 1546). Incomplete items go back to the ACD queue (step 1548) while the supervisor proceeds to log off or return to other duties (step 1550). Completed items (with or without supervisor intervention) are sent to next step where the supervisor scoring ends and/or completion of session for this interaction ends (step 1552). Scores for this session are then stored in a database (step 1554). Next, the supervisor is queried for any required specific actions to take (step 1556). If no actions are required, the supervisor may log off or attend to other duties (step 1558). If a specific action is required, the supervisor is queried on whether or not contact with customer is required (step 1560). If contact with a customer is required, then the supervisor must contact the customer for follow-up (step 1562). The supervisor is again queried to take action regarding whether or not worker discipline or coaching is required (step 1564). If worker discipline or coaching is required, the supervisor must then contact the worker for follow-up (step 1566). If no further actions are required, the supervisor may subsequently log off or returns to other duties (step 1588).<br>
[0100]	Figs. 16 and 17 illustrate processes for Customer Scoring of Workflow examples<br>
of specific media types. Customers will have the ability to participate in the completion of workflow items. For example, a loan application may be partially filed-out by a customer. Subsequent to the form being partially filled-out, the Workflow item ACD may route that form or document to a knowledge worker who checks and verifies certain data. Subsequent to the knowledge worker checking and verifying certain data, the Workflow ACD may route the modified form back to the customer for completion. This cycle may repeat itself or be modified to include various participants until the successful conclusion of the interaction(s) and workflow. In addition, customers may provide their own input on KPI measures based on their interactions with the agents, knowledge workers, supervisors and workflow items that they came into contact with. Such additional input may be accommodated in a plurality of media types. For example, customers may provide spoken or touch-tone input during an automated IVR-based (Interactive Voice Response) telephone call. Such input may be further used to dynamically route the interaction so the customer can get customized treatment during that interaction - or the data may be stored and used as a means to route and treat subsequent interactions - or that data may be used to act both on the current interaction and also subsequent interactions. Such customer-solicited input may also be gotten with interactions with e-mails, or web-based callback and chat interactions in the form of questionnaires that are screen-based. For example, such questionnaires can be automatically generated by the system as described earlier in the form of XML, EDI, JSP, CGI, or HTML-based documents which are then associated with a specific project and thus a specific workflow item for the customer interaction.<br>
 <br>
[0101]	Referring to Fig. 16, a process 1600 of customer scoring of workflow interaction<br>
phone call example according to an embodiment of the invention and starts when the customer calls in the contact center (step 1602). Beginning at step 1602, when a customer calls the Contact Center, the system extracts the ANI and DNIS data (step 1604) where the data is searched in a database (step 1606). The system checks whether or not the customer data matches the data found in the database (step 1608). If the customer data does not match, the system plays a message and queries the customer for customer ID data (step 1610). The customer next action is to input their customer identifier number (step 1614). In the case where the customer data match, the system proceeds to load the project (step 1612). Next, the KPI template is loaded (step 1616). The customer is then queried to load an interaction survey (step 1618). If the customer selects the Post-Interaction survey, the customer proceeds to the Post Interaction survey process (step 1620). If the customer selects the Pre-Interaction survey, the system plays questions from the KPI template (step 1622) following a request for customer input from the survey question (step 1624).<br>
[0102]	Following the customer input to the survey question, the customer is then queried<br>
for another survey (step 1626). If the customer decides to end the survey, the scores are stored in<br>
a database (step 1628). If the customer opts for additional survey questions, additional survey<br>
questions are played back to the customer (step 1630). For each survey question presented to the<br>
customer, the customer input is requested (step 1632). Once all additional survey questions are<br>
done, the survey is complete (step 1634) and the scores are stored in the database (step 1636).<br>
The score value is then compared to a score trigger value where additional routing may be<br>
required (step 1638). If no score trigger is initiated, the original call is answered normally (step<br>
1640). However, if the score trigger is initiated, additional routing action is required where the<br>
call is sent to the supervisor routing (1642) for further action. At the supervisor routing step<br>
(step 1642), if routing is determined to be required, the original call is sent to the supervisor (step<br>
1644). Otherwise, the call is sent to the best suited agent based on KPI Triggers and availability<br>
(step 1646). Once a call is routed to an appropriate agent (step 1648), supervisor monitoring is<br>
either required or not depending on Agent's response (step 1650). If supervisor monitoring is<br>
required, then an alert is sent to supervisor to monitor the Agent screen (step 1652). If no<br>
monitoring is required, the transaction between the customer and Agent continues (step 1654).<br>
[0103]	Towards the end of the transaction between the customer and Agent (step 1654),<br>
the customer is queried on whether to participate in a post interactive survey (step 1656). If the customer opts not to participate, the transaction ends (step 1658). Otherwise, the transaction is sent to the post interaction survey (step 1660) where the KPI Template is loaded (step 1662). At this time, the agent transfers the customer to survey questions (step 1664). Following the customer input to the survey question (step 1666), the customer is then queried for another survey (step 1668). If the customer decides to end the survey, the scores are stored in a database (step 1670). If the customer opts for additional survey questions, additional survey questions are played back to the customer (step 1672). For each survey question presented to the customer, the customer input is requested (step 1674). Once all additional survey questions are done, the survey is complete (step 1676) and the scores are stored in the database (step 1678). At the supervisor routing step (step 1680), if roofing is determined to be required, the call is sent to the supervisor (step 1682). Otherwise, the transaction ends (step 1684).<br>
[0104]	Referring to Fig. 17, a process 1700 of customer scoring of non-TVM workfiow<br>
document example according to an embodiment of the invention and starts when a customer fills out a web callback form (step 1702).   Beginning at step 1702, when a customer fills out a web<br>
 <br>
callback CGI, JSP or HTML form on the website, the system extracts the customer data (step 1704) and the customer record is searched in a database (step 1706). The system checks whether or not the customer matches the data found in the database (step 1708). If the customer data does not match, a customer verification document is sent to the customer to fill out (step 1710). Subsequently, the ACD routes a partial form to an agent or knowledge worker (step 1712). In the case where the customer data match, the system proceeds to load the project (step 1612). Next, the knowledge worker proceeds to work on the workflow document (step 1714). The workflow ACD subsequently routes the document back to the customer (step 1716) where the completed document is stored in a database (step 1718). The customer is then queried to load an interaction survey (step 1618). If the customer selects the Post-Interaction survey, the customer proceeds to the Post Interaction survey process (step 1620). If the customer selects the Pre-Interaction survey, the system plays questions from the KPI template (step 1622) following a request for customer input from the survey question (step 1624).<br>
[0105]	Following the customer input to the survey question, the customer is then queried<br>
for another survey (step 1626). If the customer decides to end the survey, the scores are stored in a database (step 1628). If the customer opts for additional survey questions, additional survey questions are played back to the customer (step 1630). For each survey question presented to the customer, the customer input is requested (step 1632). Once all additional survey questions are done, the survey is complete (step 1634) and the scores are stored in the database (step 1636). The score value is then compared to a score trigger value where additional routing may be required (step 1638). If no score trigger is initiated, the original workflow item is completed normally (step 1720). However, if the score trigger is initiated, additional routing action is required where the workflow is sent to the supervisor routing (1642) for further action. At the supervisor routing step (step 1642), if routing is determined to be required, an alert is sent to the supervisor (step 1722). Otherwise, the workflow is sent to the best suited worker based on KPI Triggers and availability (step 1724). Once the workflow item is routed to an appropriate agent (step 1726), supervisor monitoring is either required or not depending on Agent's response (step 1650). If supervisor monitoring is required, then an alert is sent to supervisor to monitor the workflow interaction (step 1728). If no monitoring is required, the interaction between the customer and Agent continues (step 1729).<br>
[0106]	Towards the end of the interaction between the customer and Agent (step 1729),<br>
the customer is queried on whether to participate in a post interaction survey (step 1656). If the<br>
customer opts not to participate, the workflow interaction ends (step 1730). Otherwise, the<br>
interaction is sent to the post interaction survey (step 1660) where the KPI Template is loaded<br>
(step 1662). At this time, the agent transfers the customer to survey questions (step 1664).<br>
Following the customer input to the survey question (step 1666), the customer is then queried for<br>
another survey (step 1668). If the customer decides to end the survey, the scores are stored in a<br>
database (step 1670). If the customer opts for additional survey questions, additional survey<br>
questions are played back to the customer (step 1672). For each survey question presented to the<br>
customer, the customer input is requested (step 1674). Once all additional survey questions are<br>
done, the survey is complete (step 1676) and the scores are stored in the database (step 1678).<br>
At the supervisor routing step (step 1680), if routing is determined to be required, an alert is sent<br>
to the supervisor (step 1740). Otherwise, the transaction ends (step 1684).<br>
[0107]	Referring to Fig. 18, a process 1800 of worker-initiated preferences of workflow<br>
items according to an embodiment of the invention and starts when the worker logs on to the workflow ACD logon page (step 1802).   Beginning at step 1802, when the worker logs on to the<br>
 <br>
workflow ACD logon page, the system validates the worker ID (step 1804) where the worker is searched in a database (step 1806). The system checks whether or not the worker matches the data found in the database (step 1808). If the worker data does not match, the worker must revalidate or is automatically logged off (step 1810). Once validated, the workflow item the worker is authorized to view is pulled (step 1814). In the case where the worker data match, the system proceeds to load the available workflow items the worker is authorized to view (step 1812). Next, the worker is queried to choose between a dynamic selection or modified stored preferences (step 1816). If the worker selects the modified stored option, the worker then is able to select the stored preferences and modify it accordingly (step 1820). The stored preferences are subsequently stored in the database (step 1822). Alternatively, if the worker selects the dynamic selection, the system displays the current workflow items available (step 1818) where the worker is able to select preferred workflow items in the ACD queue (step 1824) which is then updated (step 1826). The worker may then proceed to log off ending the process (step 1828).<br>
[0108]	The present invention provides a service creation environment for handling<br>
manual, automatic or semi-automatic manipulation of a plurality of workflow items. The process of facilitating workflow items is accomplished via Workflow Templates and associated projects created in the Administration Manager which is provided in a user-friendly interface such that it is easy and repeatable. Further, the creation of a Workflow Template and associated logic generates many views of that logic, e.g., IVR, CGI, Web CallBack, etc. The service creation environment gives the administrator the ability to choose dynamic vs. static indicators and linkage to a plurality of media types. Furthermore, these Workflow Templates are portable among call center systems.<br>
