				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The   present  invention   relates  to   novel   bis-2-difluoro-pyrrolo[2,1-c][1,4]benzodiazepine dimmers of formula VII <br><br>
(Figure Removed)wherein, n is 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10.<br>
The present invention further relates to a process for the preparation of novel bis-2-difluoro-pyrrolo[2,1-c][1,4] benzodiazepines. More particularly, it provides a process for the preparation of 1,1'-{[(bisalkane-1,N-diyl)]dioxy}bis[(11aS)-2,2-difluoro-7-methoxy-1 ,2,3,1 1a-tetrahydro-5H-pyrrolo[2,1-c] [1,4]benzodiazepin-5-one, with aliphatic chain length variations (n= 3-10) for the compounds and it also describes the DNA-binding ability of these compounds.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Pyrrolo[2,1-c][1,4]benzodiazepine antitumour antibiotics are commonly known as anthramycin class of compounds. In the last few decades, a growing interest has been shown in the development of new pyrrolo[2,1-c][1,4]benzodiazepines (PBDs). These PBDs are a family of sequence selective DNA-binding antitumour antibiotics that bind exclusively to the exocyclic N2-guanine in the minor groove of DMA via an acid-labile aminal bond to the electrophilic imine at the N10-C11 position (Kunimoto, S.; Masuda, T.; Kanbayashi, N.; Hamada, M.; Naganawa, H.; Miyamoto, M.; Takeuchi, T.; Unezawa, H. J. Antibiot., 1980, 33, 665; Kohn, K. W.; Speous, C. L. J. Mol. Biol., 1970, 51, 551; Hurley, L H. Gairpla, C.; Zmijewski, M. Biochem. Biophys. Acta., 1977, 475, 521; Kaplan, D. J.; Hurley, L. H. Biochemistry, 1981, 20, 7572). All biologically active PBDs possess the (S) configuration at the chiral C11a position, which provides the molecule with a right-handed twist, which allows them to follow the curvature of the minor groove of B-form double-stranded DNA spanning three base pairs. Recently, PBD dimers have been developed that comprise two C2-exo-methylene-<br>
substituted DC-81 subunits tethered through their C-8 position via an inert propanedioxy linker (Gregson, S. J.; Howard, P. W.; Hartely, J. A.; Brooks, N. A.; Adams, L. J.; Jenkins, Kelland, L. R.; Thurston, D. E. J. Med. Chem., 2001, 44, 737). A recent development has been the linking of two PBD units through their C-8 positions to give bisfunctional alkylating agents capable of cross-linking DNA (Thurston, D. E.; Bose, D. S.; Thomson, A. S.; Howard, P. W.; Leoni, A.; Croker, S. J.; Jenkins, T. C.; Neidle, S.; Hurley, L. H. J. Org. Chem., 1996, 61, 8141). Recently, a noncross-linking mixed imine-amide PBD dimers have been synthesized that have significant DNA binding ability and potent antitumour activitiy (Kamal, A.; Laxman, N.; Ramesh, G.; Ramulu, P; Srinivas, O US Pat. No. 636233. dt 26-03-2002; Kamal, A.; Ramesh, G.; Laxman, N.; Ramulu, P.; Srinivas, O.; Neelima, K.; Kondapi, A. K.; Srinu, V. B.; Nagarajaram, H. M. J. Med. Chem. 2002, 45, 4679).<br>
The PBDs are of considerable current interest due to their ability to recognize and subsequently form covalent bonds to specific base sequences of double-stranded DNA. Naturally occurring pyrrolo[2,1-c][1,4]benzodiazepines belong to a group of antitumour antibiotics derived from Streptomyces species with family members including anthramycin, tomaymycin, sibiromycin, chicamycin, neothramycins A and B, and DC-81.<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
However, the clinical efficacy for these antibiotics is hindered by several limitations, such as poor water solubility and cardiotoxicity and development of drug resistance and metabolic inactivation.<br>

The main object of the present invention is to provide new bis-2-difluoro pyrrolo[2,1-c][1,4]benzodiazepines as potential DMA-binding agents.<br>

The following examples are given by way of illustration and therefore should not be construed to the present limit of the scope of invention.<br>
Example 1<br>
A solution of (2S)-N-(4-hydroxy-5-methoxy-2-nitrobenzoyl)-4,4-<br>
difluoropyrrolidine 2-carboxaldehyde diethylthioacetal IV (1 mmol), 1,3-<br>
dibromopropane (0.5 mmol) and K2CO3 (3 mmol) in dry acetone (40 ml) was<br>
refluxed for 48 h. After the completion of reaction as indicated by TLC, EtOAc-<br>
hexane (6:4), the reaction mixture was poured on to the water and then<br>
extracted with ethyl acetate. Evaporation of the organic layer gave the crude<br>
product, which was further purified by column chromatography on silica gel<br>
eluting with EtOAc-hexane (1:1) to give the pure 1,1'-{[(Propane-1,3<br>
diyl)dioxy]bis[2-nitro-5-methoxy-1,4-phenylene)	carbonyl]}	bis[4,4-<br>
difluoropyrrolidine-2-carboxaldehyde diethylthioacetal] V. H1 NMR (CDCI3, 200 MHz): n 1.25-1.40 (m, 12H), 2.15-2.50 (m, 6H), 2.60-2.95 (m, 8H), 3.40-3.85 (m, 4H), 3.95 (s, 6H), 4.25-4.45 (t, 4 H), 4.75 (d, J = 4.0 Hz, 2H), 4.82-4.95 (m, 2H), 6.75 (s, 2H), 7.70 (s, 2H). FAB MASS: 914 (M+H)<br>
1,1'-{[(Propane-1,3 diyl)dioxy]bis[2-nitro-5-methoxy-1,4-phenylene) carbonyl]} bis[4,4-difluoropyrrolidine-2-carboxaldehyde diethyl thioacetal] V (1.0 mmol) was dissolved in methanol (10 ml) and to this was added SnCI2.2H2O (5.0 mmol) and was refluxed for 1.5 h. The reaction mixture was then carefully adjusted to pH 8 with saturated NaHCOs solution and then extracted with ethyl acetate (3x20 ml). The combined organic phase was dried over Na2SC&gt;4 and evaporated under vacuum to afford the crude 1,1'-{[(Propane-1,3<br>

diethylthioacetal] VI (1 mmol), HgCI2 (6.0 mmol) and CaCO3 (6.0 mmol) in CH3CN/H2O (4:1) was stirred at room temperature for 12 h until TLC (EtOAc), indicated complete loss of starting material. Then the organic layer was evaporated in vacuum and the residue was diluted with EtOAc. To this, saturated NaHCO3 solution was added slowly at room temperature and the mixture was filtered through celite and washed with ethyl acetate.

Thermal Denaturation Studies<br>
The DNA binding affinity of the novel C2 di-fluoro PBD dimers (Vlla-c) was investigated by thermal denaturation studies using calf thymus (CT) DNA (Jones, G. B.; Davey, C. L; Jenkins, T. C.; Kamal, A.; Kneale, G. G.; Neidle, S.; Webster, G. D.; Thurston, D. E. Anti-Cancer Drug Des. 1990, 5, 249. McConnaughie, A. W.; Jenkins, T. C. J. Med. Chem. 1995, 38, 3488). The studies for these compounds (Vlla-c) were carried out by DNA/ligand molar ratios of 5:1. The increase in the helix melting temperature (ATm) for each compound was examined after 0, 18 and 36 h incubation at 37 °C. Data for DC-81 and DSB-120 are included in Table 1 for comparison. The naturally occurring DC-81 gives a ATm of 0.7 °C and whereas synthetic DC-81 dimer (DSB-120) gives a A7m of 15.1 °C under identical experimental conditions (Table 1).<br>
