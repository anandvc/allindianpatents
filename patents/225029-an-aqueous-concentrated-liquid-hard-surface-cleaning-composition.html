				<td>The present invention relates to disinfectant compositions. More particularly the present invention relates to concentrated liquid disinfectant compositions which are normally diluted in a larger volume of water to form a working solution therefrom, and which exhibit a blooming effect when diluted.<br>
Blooming is a property exhibited by dilutable compositions such as known cleaning compositions, specifically pine-oil type cleaning compositions which contain a significant amount (generally at least about 5% and more) of pine oil. Certain phenolic disinfectant compounds, such as LYSOL disinfectant concentrate (Reckitt &amp; Colman, Inc., Montvale NJ) also exhibit such a blooming property. Blooming may be characterized as the formation of milky, creamy or cloudy appearance which is manifested when a dilutable composition is added to a larger volume or quantity of water. Blooming is an important characteristic from a consumer standpoint, as it is perceived to be an indicator of efficacy.<br>
According to a first aspect of the invention there is provided an aqueous concentrated liquid disinfectant composition which blooms when added to a larger volume of water which comprises the following constituents:<br>
pine oil constituent;<br>
germicidal cationic surfactant, preferably a quaternary ammonium compound<br>
having germicidal properties;<br>
organic solvent constituent;<br>
binary co-solvent system comprising alkyl diphenyl solvent and a co-solvent;<br>
optionally but desirably at least one optional constituent selected from: chelating agents, coloring agent, light stabilizers, fragrances, thickening agents, hydrotropes, pH adjusting agents, pH buffers one or more detersive surfactant constituents, particularly non-ionic and amphoteric surfactants. The one or more optional constituents are selected to not undesirably affect the overall blooming characteristics of the present inventive compositions.<br>
According to a second aspect of the invention there is provided aqueous concentrated liquid hard surface cleaning composition which blooms when added to a larger volume of water which comprises the following constituents:<br>

The one or more<br><br>
optional constituents are selected to not undesirably affect the overall blooming characteristics of the present inventive compositions.<br>
According to a third aspect of the invention there is an aqueous concentrated liquid disinfectant composition which blooms when added to a larger volume of water which comprises the following constituents:<br>
a terpene based solvent;<br>
germicidal cationic surfactant, preferably a quaternary ammonium compound<br>
having germicidal properties;<br>
organic solvent constituent;<br>
a binary co-solvent system comprising alky! diphenyl solvent and a co-solvent;<br>
one or more nonionic surfactants;<br>
optionally but desirably at least one optional constituent selected from: chelating agents, coloring agents, light stabilizers, fragrances, thickening agents, hydrotropes, pH adjusting agents, pH buffers one or more detersive surfactant constituents, particularly non-ionic and amphoteric surfactants, as well as others known the art and useful in similar compositions; and,<br>
the balance being water.<br>
In preferred embodiments of the third aspect of the invention, the terpene based solvent constituent is present with respect to the alkyl diphenyl solvent in a respective weight ratio of from 8:1 to 1:2, with the total amount of these combined constituents not exceeding 9%wt. of the total weight of the concentrate compositions. This third inventive aspect demonstrates compositions with good blooming characteristics, but with relatively reduced amounts of pine oil or terpene based solvent.<br>
Processes for the cleaning and/or disinfecting of hard surfaces using any of the inventive compositions taught herein are also contemplated to form part of the invention.<br>
In preferred embodiments the concentrate compositions provide excellent Initial blooming characteristics in "as mixed" dilutions with water, but also exhibit good retention of blooming characteristics over a longer time period, viz., days and weeks.<br>
It is a still further object of the invention to provide such a concentrated liquid disinfectant composition, such as according to the first aspect of the invention, which in a diluted form provides disinfection of surfaces wherein the presence of gram positive type pathogenic bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus, and/or the presence of gram negative type pathogenic bacteria such as Escherichia co//and/or Pseudomonas aeruginosa is suspected, Terpene based solvent<br>
The terpene based solvent constituent, includes one or more further terpene based solvents. These terpene based solvents preferably contain mono- and bicyclic monoterpenes, i.e., those of the hydrocarbon class, which include, for example, the terpinenes, terpinolenes, limonenes, pinenes and mixtures thereof. Useful terpenes<br><br>
include d-limonene, and the mixture of terpene hydrocarbons obtained from the essence of oranges, e.g., cold-pressed orange terpenes and orange terpene oil phase ex fruit juice, and the mixture of terpene hydrocarbons expressed from lemons and grapefruit. Numerous other terpene hydrocarbons are known to those skilled in the art and may be used to prepare the blooming type, germicidal hard surface cleaning and disinfecting compositions of the present invention; however, those as mentioned above recited which are based on d-limonene and the mixture of terpene hydrocarbons obtained from citrus fruits are the most readily available and, hence, are preferred. Of these d-limonene is the most prefererred.<br>
These terpene containing solvent constituents particularly useful according to the third aspect of the invention are typically supplied as technical grade materials which may be and are often formulated with small amounts, e.g., 0.1 %wt. (weight percent,) of auxiliary materials such as one or more stabilizers, e.g., antioxidants such as butylated hydroxytoluene. Such auxiliary materials are included within the meaning of the term "terpene containing solvent", as employed in this specification and the accompanying claims.<br>
The concentrate compositions of the third aspect of the invention desirably comprise a terpene based constituent which may be a pine oil constituent, or a d-limonene constituent or which may include both these materials. Pine oil is an organic solvent, and is a complex blend of oils, alcohols, acids, esters, aldehydes and other organic compounds, and may be used as part of, or all of the terpene based solvent constituent. Preferred pine oil preparations which comprise at least about 50% terpene alcohols, more desirably at least about 60% terpene alcohols.<br>
Particularly useful d-limonene containing compositions include those described above.<br>
The terpene containing solvent constituent may be present in the concentrate compositions according to the third aspect of the invention in amounts of from about 0.001 % by weight to up to about 20% by weight, preferably about 0.1 -15% by weight, most preferably in amount of between 1 -12% by weight.<br>
According to certain preferred embodiments of the third aspect of the invention, the terpene solvent constituent is solely a d-limonene constituent.<br>
According to certain preferred embodiments of the third aspect of the invention, the terpene solvent constituent is solely a pine oil constituent, especially the preferred pine oil preparations described above. Pine oil constituent<br>
The concentrate compositions of the first and second aspects of the invention comprise a pine oil constituent. This pine oil constituent may also be present in compositions according to the third aspect of the invention. Pine oil is an organic solvent, and is a complex blend of oils, alcohols, acids, esters, aldehydes and other organic compounds. These include terpenes which include a large number of related alcohols or ketones. Some important constituents include terpineol, which is one of<br><br>
three isomeric alcohols having the basic molecular formula C16H170H. Useful pine oils include synthetic pine oil, and also include steam distilled and sulfate pine oils, and will generally contain a higher content of turpentine alcohols. Other important compounds include alpha- and beta-pinene (turpentine), abietic acid (rosin), and other isoprene derivatives.<br>
Particularly effective pine oils which are presently commercially available include those in the GLIDCO Pine Oil series, which includes grades "60", "80", "150", "SW", "350" having respectively 60%wt., 80%wt., 85%wt., 75%wt. and 100%wt. of terpene alcohols, (which is sometimes referred to as alpha-terpineol) especially terpineol.<br>
The pine oil constituent may be present in the concentrate compositions of the first and second aspects of the invention in amounts of from about 0.001 % by weight to up to about 20% by weight, preferably about 0.1-15% by weight, most preferably in amount of between 1-12 % pine oil by weight. Preferred of these are pine oil preparations which comprise at least about 50% terpene alcohols (alpha-terpineols), more desirably at least about 60% terpene alcohols, and more preferably those which comprise at least about 80% terpene alcohols. Germicidal cationic surfactant<br>
The concentrate compositions according to the first and third aspects of the invention include as a necessary constituent at least one cationic surfactant which is found to provide a broad antibacterial or sanitizing function. Any cationic surfactant which satisfies these requirements may be used and are considered to be within the scope of the present invention.<br>
Examples of preferred cationic surfactant compositions useful in the practice of the instant invention are those which provide a germicidal effect to the concentrate compositions, and especially preferred are quaternary ammonium compounds and salts thereof, which may be characterized by the general structural formula:<br><br>
wherein at least one of Ri, Rz, R3 and R4 is a alkyl, aryl or alkylaryl substituent of from 6 to 26 carbon atoms, and the entire cation portion of the molecule has a molecular weight of at least 165. The alkyl substituents may be long-chain alkyl, long-chain alkoxyaryl, long-chain alkylaryl, halogen-substituted long-chain alkylaryl, long-chain alkylphenoxyalkyl, arylalkyi, etc. The remaining substituents on the nitrogen atoms other than the abovementioned alkyl substituents are hydrocarbons usually containing no more than 12 carbon atoms. The substituents Ri, R2, Ra and R4 may be straight-chained or may be branched, but are preferably straight-chained, and may include one<br><br>
or more amide, ether or ester linkages.   The counterion X may be any salt-forming anion which permits water solubility of the quaternary ammonium complex.<br>
Exemplary quaternary ammonium salts within the above description include the alkyl ammonium halides such as cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide, alkyl aryl ammonium halides such as octadecyl dimethyl benzyl ammonium bromide, N-alkyI pyridinium halides such as N-cetyl pyridinium bromide, and the like. Other suitable types of quaternary ammonium salts include those in which the molecule contains either amide, ether or ester linkages such as octyl phenoxy ethoxy ethyl dimethyl benzyl ammonium chloride, N-(laurylcocoaminoformylmethyl)-pyridinium chloride, and the like. Other very effective types of quaternary ammonium compounds which are useful as germicides include those in which the hydrophobic radical is characterized by a substituted aromatic nucleus as in the case of lauryloxyphenyltrimethyl ammonium chloride, cetylaminophenyltrimethyl ammonium methosulfate, dodecylphenyltrlmethyl ammonium methosulfate, dodecyibenzyltrimethyl ammonium chloride, chlorinated dodecylbenzyltrimethyl ammonium chloride, and the like.<br>
Preferred quaternary ammonium compounds which act as germicides and which are be found useful in the practice of the present invention include those which have the structural formula:<br><br>
wherein R2 and R3 are the same or different C8-Ci2a!kyl, or R2 is Ci2.i6alkyl, Ca-isalkylethoxy, Cs-iealkylphenolethoxy when R3 is benzyl, and X is a halide, for example chloride, bromide or iodide, or is a methosulfate anion. The alkyl groups recited in R2 and R3 may be straight-chained or branched, but are preferably substantially linear.<br>
Particularly useful quaternary germicides include compositions which include a single quaternary compound, as well as mixtures of two or more different quaternary compounds, such as blends of alkyl dimethyl benzyl ammonium chlorides. Exemplary useful quaternary ammonium compounds include those available under the tradenames BARDAC, BARQUAT, HYAMINE, LONZABAC (ex. Lonza Inc., orStepan Co.)<br>
The germicidal cationic surfactant, especially the preferred quaternary ammonium salts described above may be present in any germicidally effective concentration. Advantageously, the germicidal cationic surfactant, when present, may be present in the concentrate compositions in amounts of from about 0.001 % by weight to up to about 15% by weight, preferably about 0.01-10% by weight, most preferably in amount of between about 0.5 - 8 % by weight.<br><br>
Organic Solvent constituent<br>
A further constituent according to the invention is an organic solvent. This organic solvent, which is present in addition to the pine oil (which is itself known to be an organic solvent) assists in improves the dispersability and/or miscibility of the water insoluble pine oil in water. The organic solvent may also improve the miscibility of further constituents according to the present invention, including any water insoluble or poorly soluble constituents. Many useful organic solvents which are known to be useful in dispersing pine oil in water may be used; virtually any may be used as long as it does not undesirably disrupt the favorable characteristics of the invention, especially the blooming characteristic. Mixtures of two or more organic solvents may also be used as the organic solvent constituent.<br>
Useful organic solvents are those which are at least partially water-miscible such as alcohols, water-miscible ethers (e.g. diethylene glycol diethylether, diethylene glycol dimethylether, propylene glycol dimethylether), water-miscible glycol ether (e.g. propylene glycol monomethylether, propylene glycol mono ethylether, propylene glycol monopropylether, propylene glycol monobutylether, ethylene glycol monobutylether, dipropylene glycol monomethylether, diethyleneglycol monobutylether), lower esters of monoalkylethers of ethyleneglycol or propylene glycol (e.g. propylene glycol monomethy! ether acetate) These materials are all commercially available (ex. Union Carbide, Dow, or Hoechst) Mixtures of organic solvents can also be used.<br>
Particularly useful organic solvents include glycols such as alkylene glycols such as propylene glycol, and glycol ethers. Examples of such glycol ethers include those having the general structure R"-0-R"-OH, wherein R" is an alky of 1 to 20 carbon atoms, or is aryl, or is alkaryl of at least 6 carbon atoms, and R" is an ether condensate of propylene glycol and/or ethylene glycol having from one to ten glycol monomer units. Examples of such useful glycol ethers include propylene glycol methyl ether, dipropylene glycol methyl ether, tripropylene glycol methyl ether, propylene glycol isobutyl ether, ethylene glycol methyl ether, ethylene glycol ethyl ether, ethylene glycol butyl ether, diethylene glycol phenyl ether, propylene glycol phenol ether, and mixtures thereof. Preferred are ethylene glycol n-butyl ether, diethylene glycol n-butyl ether, and mixtures thereof. Such glycol ethers are presently commercially available from a number of sources including in the DOWANOL™ glycol ethers (ex. Dow Chemical Co.).<br>
Further particularly useful organic solvents monohydric (straight chained or branched) primary, secondary or tertiary lower aliphatic alcohols, especially Ci-Ce aliphatic primary and secondary alcohols, of which isopropanol is particularly preferred.<br>
It has generally been found the addition of only a minimum effective amount which is found to be effective in dispersing or solubilizing the pine oil constituent and any other aqueous insoluble or poorly soluble constituents in the concentrate compositions is desirably used. Such is due to desire to reduce the amount of volatile<br><br>
organic constituents in the concentrate compositions of the invention, which volatile organic constituents are desirably minimized from an environmental standpoint. The present inventors have found that inclusion of the organic solvent constituent in amounts of about 0.001% by weight to about 50% by weight have been found to be effective to solubiiize the pine oil, as well as in solubilizing other less water soluble constituents present in the concentrate compositions of the invention. Preferably, the organic solvent constituent is present in the concentrate compositions of the invention in amounts of from 0.1 - 40% by weight, and most preferably from about 0.1 - 35% by weight.<br>
Additionally the inventor has found the according to certain preferred embodiments the organic solvent constituent, comprises, and in certain especially preferred embodiments consist essentially of, both an alkylene glycol such as propylene glycol, and a monohydric lower aliphatic alcohol such as a Ci-Ce aliphatic primary and secondary alcohol, especially isopropyl alcohol. Binary co-solvent system<br>
The inventive compositions further also include a binary co-solvent system comprising alkyl diphenyl solvent and a co-solvent which aids in the solubilization of the diphenyl solvent in an aqueous medium.<br>
The alkyl diphenyl solvent is one which may be generally represented by the formula<br><br><br>
The alkyl diphenyl solvent may be present in the concentrate compositions in amounts of from about 0.001 % by weight to up to about 7% by weight, preferably about 0.01-5 % by weight, most preferably in amount of between 0.1-2 % by weight.<br>
The inventors have observed that the concentrated compositions of the invention are greatly improved with the addition of a co-solvent. This co-solvent aids in the solubilization of the alkyl diphenyl solvent in water is desirably an at least partially water-miscible monohydric linear primary alcohol, especially a water-miscible monohydric primary Cs-Cis alcohol, or is benzyl alcohol. Particularly effective are cetyl, lauryl and myristyl alcohols, and benzyl alcohol. The inventors have found that the inclusion of such alcohols greatly aids in the dissolution of the alkyl diphenyl solvents in the concentrate compositions according to the invention being described herein, which aids in ensuring that clarity of the concentrate composition is maintained which is particularly desirable from a consumer standpoint.<br>
The co-solvent may be present in the concentrate compositions in amounts of from about 0.001 % by weight to up to about 5% by weight, preferably about 0.01-3% by weight, most preferably in amount of between 0.1 - 2% by weight.<br>
Desirably, the binary co-solvent system comprising the alkyl diphenyl solvent and a co-solvent are present in amounts of from 0.001 - 12%wt., more preferably from 0.1 -12%wt.<br>
Alternately, it is contemplated that the preferred co-solvent described above may be substituted in whole or in part by one or more nonionic or amphoteric surfactants which are also shown to aid in the dissolution of the alkyl diphenyl solvent in water. Such one or more nonionic or amphoteric surfactants include those described below. Amine oxide surfactant<br>
Compositions according to the second aspect of the invention include one or more amine oxide surfactants. Such amine oxides desirably improve the miscibility of the pine oil constituents in the aqueous phase of the concentrate compositions. Non-limiting examples of useful amine oxide semi-polar nonionic surfactants include those according to either of the formulae:<br><br><br>
wherein Ri is hydrogen or is an alkyl, 2-hydroxyalkyl, 3-hydroxyalkyl, or 3-alkoxy-2-hydroxypropyl radical where the alkyl and alkoxy parts contain from about 8 to about 18 carbon atoms, R2 and R3 are independently selected from methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, 2-hydroxyethyl, 2-hydroxypropyl, or 3-hydroxypropyl, m is an integer from 2 to 4, and n is an integer from 0 to about 10.   Preferably, the amine oxide semi-polar nonionic surfactants are those according to the formula immediately preceding wherein Ri is an alkyl radical of from 12 to 16 carbon atoms, Rj and R3 are independently selected from methyl or ethyl, m is 2, and n is 0.

Nonionic surfactant compositions based on amine oxides described previously are useful in compositions according to the third aspect of the inventive compositions. Most desirably the nonionic surfactant is a mixture of linear primary alcohol ethoxylates and surfactants based on based on alkoxylated, especially ethoxylated, glyceryl esters wherein the amount of the former surfactant exceeds the latter surfactant, and more desirably wherein at least twice of much of the former surfactant is present relative to the latter. Particularly preferred nonionic surfactants, and particularly preferred relative weight ratios are demonstrated by one or more of the Examples.<br>
The nonionic surfactant is desirably present in amounts of from about 0.001 -12%wt., more preferably in amounts of from about 1-10%wt., and most preferably in amounts of from about 5 -10%wt. in compositions according to the third aspect of the invention.<br>
It is to be understood that these nonionic surfactants may be included as optional constituents according to the first and second aspects of the invention. Water<br>
Water is added in order to provide 100% by weight of the concentrate composition. Water is added in amounts which are sufficient to form the concentrated compositions which amount is sufficient to ensure the retention of a substantially dear characteristic when produced as a concentrate, but at the same time ensuring good blooming upon the addition of the concentrated composition to a further amount of water, or upon the addition of further water to the concentrate.

The inventive compositions may include one or more further optional constituents. By way of non-limiting examples, these include chelating agents, coloring agents, light stabilizers, fragrances, thickening agents, hydrotropes, pH adjusting agents, pH buffers one or more detersive surfactant constituents particularly non-ionic and amphoteric surfactants. Generally the total weight of such further conventional additives may comprise up to 20% by weight of a concentrated composition formulation.<br>
Further optional, but advantageously included constituents are one or more coloring agents which find use in modifying the appearance of the concentrate compositions and enhance their appearance from the perspective of a consumer or other end user. Known coloring agents, such as a color ranging from colorless to a deep amber, deep amber yellow or deep amber reddish color. Such a coloring agent or coloring agents may be added in any useful amount in a conventional fashion, i.e., admixing to a concentrate composition or blending with other constituents used to form a concentrate composition. However, other colors atypical of pine oil type cleaning concentrates may be used as well. Known art light stabilizer constituents, such as<br><br>
stilbene derivatives may also be added, particularly wherein coloring agents are used in a composition. As is known to the art, such light stabilizers act to retain the appearance characteristics of the concentrate compositions over longer intervals of time.<br>
Exemplary useful buffers include the alkali metal phosphates, polyphospates, pyrophosphates, triphosphates, tetraphosphates, silicates, metasilicates, polysilicates, carbonates, hydroxides, and mixtures of the same.

It may also be suitable to use buffers such materials as aluminosilicates (zeolites), borates, aluminates and certain organic materials such as gluconates, succinates, maleates, and their alkali metal salts. Such buffers keep the pH ranges of the compositions of the present invention within acceptable limits.<br>
Exemplary useful pH adjusting agents include known materials which may be used to adjust the pH of the concentrate compositions to a desired range.<br>
The useful optional nonionic surfactants, include known art nonionic surfactant compounds, including those described previously.

Certain particularly preferred embodiments of the third aspect of the invention are disclosed on Table 1.3 of the Examples<br>
The concentrated compositions of the first, second or third aspect of the invention as taught herein may be used without dilution, i.e., in concentrate:water concentrations of 1:0, to extremely dilute dilutions such as 1:10,000. Desirably, the concentrate is diluted in the range of 1:0.1 -1:1000, preferably in the range of 1:1 -1:500 but most preferably in the range of 1:10 -1:100. The actual dilution selected is<br><br>
in part determinable by the degree and amount of dirt and grime to be removed from a surface(s), the amount of mechanical force imparted to remove the same, as well as the observed efficacy of a particular dilution.<br>
In accordance with preferred embodiments of the invention, when a quantity of the concentrate compositions taught herein are added to a larger volume of water, a blooming characteristic is manifested. Such "blooming" may be broadly characterized as the formation of milky, creamy or cloudy appearance which is manifested when a dilutable composition is added to a larger volume or quantity of water. Such "blooming" may be alternately characterized as the reduction of transmitted light through an amount of water by at least 30%, desirably by at least 40%, yet more desirably by at least about 50%, and yet most desirably by at least 60% or more when a dilution of the concentrate composition:water with the weight or volume ratio range of from 1 ;64 -102 is formed, wherein the dilution is at 20°C (68°F). That such blooming may be attained without the use of pine oil fractions as is common in certain commercially available pine oil containing preparations is surprising.<br>
As has been noted, concentrate compositions according to preferred embodiments of the invention exhibit a long lasting blooming effect when they are diluted into a larger volume of water, especially when used to form (weight ratio) dilutions with water of concentrate:water of 1:64 at room temperature. Desirably, such dilutions do not exhibit an increase in light transmittance in accordance with the measurement methods discussed in the Examples below, of more than 50% (based on the initial "as mixed" value) during its initial three-day interval.<br>
The concentrate compositions taught herein, and dilutions formed therefrom are useful in the cleaning and/or sanitization of hard surfaces.<br>
In preferred embodiments of the first aspect of the invention, aqueous dilutions of the concentrated aqueous liquid disinfectant compositions exhibit antimicrobial efficacy against at least one of the following bacteria: Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coll., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, where the ratio of concentrate composition:water is 1:64 to 1:102. According to more preferred embodiments the compositions exhibit efficacy against at least two of the following bacteria: Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, where the ratio of concentrate composition:water of 1:64 to 1:102. Such aqueous dilutions may be classified as "broad spectrum disinfectant" compositions. According to a still more preferred embodiment, aqueous dilutions of the concentrated aqueous liquid disinfectant compositions of the first aspect of the invention exhibit antimicrobial efficacy against all three of the following bacteria: Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, where the ratio of concentrate composition:water of 1:64 to 1:102. Such aqueous dilutions may be classified as "hospital strength disinfectant" compositions. In each of these respective preferred, more preferred and still more preferred embodiments described immediately above, those which exhibit antimicrobial efficacy at greater aqueous dilutions of the concentrated aqueous liquid<br><br>
disinfectant compositions in water, such as at concentrate:water dilution ratios ratios of 1:102, are preferred over concentrate:water dilution ratios of 1:85, and still more preferred over concentrate;water dilution ratios of 1:64.<br>
Such dilution ratios of concentrate:water as described above may be volume/volume basis, or a weight/weight basis.<br>
The following examples below illustrate exemplary and among them preferred formulations of the compositions according to the first and second aspects of the invention.<br>
Examples<br>
A number of formulations were produced by mixing the constituents outlined on Tables 1.1, Table 2.1 and 3.1 by adding the individual constituents into a beaker of deionized water at room temperature which was stirred with a conventional magnetic stirring rod. The order of addition is not critical, but good results are obtained where the surfactants are added to the water prior to Stirring continued until the formulation was homogenous in appearance. It is to be noted that the constituents might be added in any order, but it is preferred that water be the initial constituent provided to a mixing vessel or apparatus as it is the major constituent and addition of the further constituents thereto is convenient.<br>
It is to be noted the compositions demonstrating the formulations according to the first aspect of the invention are provided on Table 1.1, those according to the second aspect of the invention are listed on Table 1.2 and those according to the third aspect of the invention are listed on Table 1.3<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
All of the formulations on Tables 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3 indicated weight percent, and the percent actives of individual constituents are 100% unless otherwise indicated.<br>
The blooming characteristics of certain compositions described on Tables 1.1 and 1.2 was characterized by using the Brinkman Sybron PC 801 colorimeter. Each tested formulation were diluted with deionized water in a weight ratio of 1:64, and the test was carried out with each of the formulations and water at room temperature (68°F, 20°C). The resulting determined values, reported as "blooming" in the following table provide an empirical evaluation in percent transmittance (%) of the degree of transparency of a diluted example formulation wherein 0% indicates complete opacity and 100% the transparency of a deionized water sample. The result was tabulated as follows:<br><br>
As may be seen from the results indicated on Table 2, the formulation according to comparative example 1 (Comp.1) which did not include the biphenyi solvent did not give intense "bloom".   In contrast, the formulations according to the first and second aspects of the invention provided an excellent blooming effect.<br>
The formulations of Ex. 1.2, 2.3, 2.4 and 2.5 were diluted with deionised water in a weight ratio of 1:64, at room temperature (68°F, 20°C), and the degree of transparency was determined using the apparatus and method described above. For comparative purposes, a formulation ("Comp. 3")from the prior art, namely Ex. 3 from Table 1 of US 5629280 was prepared in accordance with the teaching in that patent, and similarly diluted and tested. These diluted formulations were evaluated over an eight day period at intervals so to determine the long term blooming behaviour of the<br><br><br>
As the results of Table 3 indicate, the compositions according to the present invention provided superior results, both with respect to initial blooming property in the "as mixed" dilutions, but also maintained excellent blooming characteristics over a longer duration.<br>
The blooming characteristics of the formulations according to the third aspect of the invention were also characterized by using the Brinkman Sybron PC 801 colorimeter. Each tested formulation were diluted with deionized water in a weight ratio of 1:64, and the test was carried out with each of the formulations and water at room temperature (68°F, 20°C), as described above. Blooming characteristics of these formulations was evaluated both initially, and on a long term. Ail of the formulations and compositions were maintained at room temperature (68°F, 20°C) throughout the duration of the test. The results are indicated on Table 3.3.<br><br><br><br>
Mb may ue seen rrom tne results indicated on Table 3.3, the formulations according to the third aspect of the invention provided comparable or superior initial and short term (viz., to 2 hours) blooming when diluted in a larger quantity of water a compared to the formulation of Comp. 3A which included 9% of the pine oil constituent, but no biphenyl solvent. Further, certain of the dilutions of the concentrate compositions according to the invention which included the biphenyl solvent but which had reduced amounts of pine oil constituents provided excellent retention of blooming, particularly evidenced in the latter days of the test. Antimicrobial efficacy<br>
A modified European suspension test was carried out for formulations according to the first aspect of the invention. Examples 1.1, and 1.2 described above and as a comparative example, DETTOL (ex. Reckitt &amp; Colman PLC, England). The method is summarized as follow.<br>
1)	Pipette 8 ml of the test product dilution into sterile medicant tube and held at 20C+ 1C in water bath.<br>
2)	In another sterile medicant tube pipette 1.0 ml of adjusted culture and 1.0 ml of prepared Bovine Albumin Solution and held at 20C + 1C in water bath.<br>
3)	At time =0 minute, add product solution into medicant tube containing a mixture of Bovine Albumin Solution and culture suspension of each test organism. This mixture results in a final dilution of the test product, a concentration of 0.03% of Bovine Albumin Solution and bacterial count of at least 1-3 x10"^7CFU/ml.<br>
4)	At time =5 minutes, pipette 1 ml of this mixture into 9 ml of neutralizing solution (letheen broth) so as to achieve 1:10 dilution. Prepare serial dilution in Letheen broth and place with Tryticase soy with lecithin and Tween 80 agar in duplicate.<br>
Control:   The procedure as outlined above was repeated, using 8 ml of sterile water instead of product dilution for each test organism.<br>
To pass the test method, it was required that the tested formulations satisfa a 5 log reduction in reference bacterial strain of S.aureus (ATTC #5438), Ps.aeruginosa (ATTC #15442), Escherichia coli (ATTC #10536), with 5 minutes contact time at 20°C + 1°C under defined testing method.   It was found that each of the formulastions (Ex.1, Ex.2) showed complete reduction of the test organisms at the testing contact time. The testing requirements indicate a (great than) "&gt;5" log reduction within 5 minutes. All the above samples exceed this requirement. It was concluded that formulations according to Ex. 1.1 and 1.2 have at least the same microbial activity as DETTOL.<br>
Several of the exemplary formulations described in more detail on Table 1 above were evaluated in order to evaluate their antimicrobial efficacy against Staphylococcus aureus (gram positive type pathogenic bacteria) (ATCC 6538), Salmonella choleraesuis (gram negative type pathogenic bacteria) (ATCC 10708), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (gram negative type pathogenic bacteria) (ATCC 15442).<br><br>
The testing was performed in accordance with the protocols outlined in "Use-Dilution Method", Protocols 955.14, 955.15 and 964.02 described in Chapter 6 of "Official Methods of Analysis", 16"" Edition, of the Association of Official Analytical Chemists; "Germicidal and Detergent Sanitizing Action of Disinfectants", 960.09 described in Chapter 6 of"Official Methods of Analysis", 15"^ Edition, of the Association of Official Analytical Chemists; or American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) E 1054-91 the contents of which are herein incorporated by reference. This test is also commonly referred to as the "AOAC Use-Dilution Test Method".<br>
As is appreciated by the skilled practitioner in the art, the results of the AOAC Use-Dilution Test Method indicates the number of test substrates wherein the tested organism remains viable after contact for 10 minutes with at test disinfecting composition / total number of tested substrates (cylinders) evaluated in accordance with the AOAC Use-Dilution Test. Thus, a result of "0/60" indicates that of 60 test substrates bearing the test organism and contacted for 10 minutes in a test disinfecting composition, 0 or 1 test substrates had viable (live) test organisms at the conclusion of the test. Such a result is excellent, illustrating the excellent disinfecting efficacy of the tested composition.<br>
Results of the antimicrobial testing are indicated on the Table, below. The reported results indicate the number of test cylinders with live test organisms/number of test cylinders tested for each example formulation and organism tested.<br><br>
As may be seen from the results indicated above, the compositions according to the invention provide excellent sanitizing benefits to hard surfaces as demonstrated by the excellent antimicrobial efficacy of these compositions against known bacteria<br>
Cleaning Test:<br>
Cleaning efficacy was measured for weight ratios of 1:64 (concentrate composition:water) aqeuous dilutions of various formulations according to the invention, as well as a comparative composition. The test was carried out using the ASTM D4488-89, Annex A2 method - greasy soil on painted masonite wallboard test, using a Gardner Washability Apparatus.<br>
Latex painted masonite wallboard is soiled with a mixture of melted, oily soils containing a small amount of carbon black and allowed to set overnight. A first aqueous dilution is applied to a sponge that scrubs half the soiled substrate in a straight-line using the Gardner Washability Apparatus. Aften/vards, the second<br><br>
aqueous dilution is applied to a furtlier sponge that scrubs the other half of the soiled substrate in a similar manner.<br>
In determining the cleaning efficiency, reflectance values were determined using a Gardner Lab Scan Reflectometer for each of the following: a clean unsoiled panel, a soiled panel, and a soiled panel following Gardner Washability Apparatus scrubbing. Such reflectance values were then employed to calculate % cleaning efficiency according to the following formula:<br><br>
As shown, the measurement of the cleaning effectiveness of the test samples involved the ability of the cleaning composition to remove the test soil from the test substrate. This was expressed by % Cleaning Efficiency. As numerical values for a % Cleaning Efficiency increase, higher cleaning effectiveness is achieved for the cleaning composition tested. As the results show, the inventive composition showed an excellent cleaning property.<br><br><br>
