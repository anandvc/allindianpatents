				<td>Apparatus and method for the continuous pickling of steel strip<br>
The invention relates in general to the pickling of steel strip running continuously through a pickling apparatus,, and more specifically a pickling method which includes centralized control of all of the pickling operations and the apparatus for implementing said pickling.<br>
In their production processes, the steel strips are hot rolled at temperatures that can reach nearly 1200°C at the end of rolling, and then cold rolled. After hot rolling, .the steel strips are cooled by spraying water onto the faces of the rolled strips, and they are wound at temperatures of up to 800°C onto coils. During hot rolling, an oxidizing reaction with the water spray forms an iron-oxide layer known as "scale", such that following hot rolling, the steel strips are covered by a relatively thick and hard layer of scale. Oxidation continues as the coils are air cooled.  The different temperatures and sources' of oxidation result in the presence of three iron oxides in the scale. This scale must be removed before final cold rolling, as otherwise it would encrust onto the metal and significantly alter its surface condition and its suitability for deep drawing. Furthermore, as the scale layer is extremely hard, its presence on the steel strips could cause very rapid wear of the cold-rolling rollers. Systems comprising specialized lines that subject strips running continuously through tanks containing acid pickling solutions to chemical pickling are classically used for pickling hot-rolled strips.<br>
In the oldest systems, the pickling solutions are solutions of sulfuric acid. However, hydrochloric acid-based pickling solutions are used nowadays for environmental and', productivity reasons.<br>
An example of a classical continuous pickling line apparatus 1 is shown in Figure 1. It is a pickling apparatus 1, comprising:<br>
-	a fragmentation system 11 for the oxides that have formed on the surface of the steel strip 2 during hot rolling of that strip 2, to accelerate the subsequent pickling process,<br>
-	an actual pickling system 12 comprising a plurality of pickling tanks (not shown in Figure 1) for the acid to corrode these oxides, and<br>
-	a rinsing unit 15 to remove the acid (in particular hydrochloric acid) and iron chlorides present on the surface of the strip 2,<br>
the fragmentation system 11, the pickling system 12 and the, rinsing unit being arranged in series such that the strip 2 being pickled passes them successively as it runs continuously through the pickling apparatus 1. The apparatus 1 shown in Figure 1 also includes:<br>
-	a set of strip uncoilers 21 operating alternately, a welder 23 and a first accumulation system 4, which are arranged in series upstream of the fragmentation system 11, and<br>
-	a drier 25, a second accumulation system 26, an edge shear 27, an oiler 28, a shear 29 and.a set of coilers 30, which are also arranged in series but downstream of the pickling system 12.<br>
In operation, the strip 2 being pickled is uncoiled by the strip uncoilers 21 and passes the shear 22 which crops the head of the strip.2. The strip 2, passing the welder 23, is then welded to the tail of the strip previously cropped by the shear 22. The accumulation system 24 then enables the strip 2 to be accumulated, and then returned downstream, i.e. immediately upstream of the fragmentation system 11, when the tail of the previous strip and the strip 2 being pickled are welded. The strip'. 2 then passes the oxide fragmentation system 11, commonly known as an oxide breaker. This fragmentation system 11 in<br>
 particular enables the mechanical fragmentation of the scale formed on the strip 2 during the hot-rolling phase, which facilitates and speeds up the acid pickling of the strip 2 which immediately follows this mechanical fragmentation. Then, having passed the fragmentation system 11, the strip 2 being pickled runs continuously through the pickling tanks of the pickling system 12, which are each filled with a churning pickling solution. The acid pickling of the strip 2 is then realized by dipping, and a pickled strip 2 is obtained.<br>
Then, having run through the tanks of the pickling system 12, the strip 2 is then rinsed in the. rinsing unit 15, then dried in the drier 25. The second accumulation device 2 6 enables the strip 2 to run continuously through the pickling apparatus 1 during the cropping and coiler 30 loading operations.<br>
The edge shear 27 is used to remove the edges of the strip to ensure there are no "edge" defects, such as cracks, and to guarantee a continuous strip width. The oiler 28 is used to protect the pickled sheet against oxidation. The shear 29 crops the strip 2 at the end of the coil, and the coilers 30, which operate alternately, coil the pickled strip 2.<br>
The oxide fragmentation operation, which is intended to speed up the overall strip pickling operation, is typically realized in an oxide fragmentation system 11, such as the one shown schematically in Figure 1 and in greater detail in Figure 2. This system 11 enables the fragmentation of. the scale layer using a technique known as "tension levelrng", which involves alternately bending the strip 2 on work rolls 111, which are held by supporting rollers 112, the strip 2 being subjected to elongation by the input 113 and output 114 tensioners. Elongation may reach 2%.   The example fragmentation system 12 shown in Figure 3 is one of the most commonly used systems', on continuous pickling<br>
lines. Such a system 11 also helps to improve the flatness of the strip 2 being pickled.<br>
The actual pickling operation involves causing the iron oxides ("scale") to react with the acid pickling solution. Different chemical reactions occur in this pickling solution depending on the chemical characteristics of the scale layer. In fact, when the strip is hot, between the output of the final finishing stand of the hot mill and the coiler, the scale has a structure made up of layers of protoxide FeO, magnetite Fe304 and a little hematite Fe2O3. When the coils are cooling in ambient air, the strip heads and tails and the edges cool rapidlyT and the scale develops into an Fe3O4 and Fe2O3 structure. As the rest of the strip cools more slowly, the scale forming on it is essentially an Fe3O4-Fe eutectic composition potentially with a little residual FeO.<br>
Thus, during pickling in a pickling solution based on hydrochloric acid, the following chemical reactions occur:<br>
(Equation Removed) <br>
These reactions demonstrate that during pickling the pickling solution has an overall tendency to become less acidic and to become charged correspondingly with iron chlorides. As a continuous pickling process requires the characteristics of the pickling solution to be kept as constant as possible, it must necessarily be regenerated in "regeneration" tanks, which are arranged in line with the pickling installation and which work by injection into a furnace or reactor. Moreover, inhibitors are used to limit the acid corrosion on the bare steel, in particular if the strip stops in the bath.<br>
The loss of acidity in the pickling solution, the flow of pickling solution drawn by the strip down through the pickling apparatus, the need to renew and to ensure the best possible concentration balance between successive tanks in the pickling system have led to the adoption of a pickling system such as the one shown in Figure 3. This comprises a plurality of pickling tanks 121, 122, 123 (usually at least 3), which are each filled with pickling solution 1211, 1221, 1231 made up notably of sulfuric acid or hydrochloric acid. These tanks 121, 122, 123 are arranged in series one behind the other following the longitudinal running direction of the strip 2, such that the strip runs successively from one to the other (in this case from tank 123 to tank 121 via tank 122). The control means for movement of the strip 2 (not shown in Figure 3), for example a coiler, are classically arranged at the output of the pickling apparatus 1. These control means enable the strip 2 to be driven in the running direction so that it passes successively through the different pickling tanks 121, 122, 123 forming inside each of them a concave curve oriented upwards (known as a "catenary" curve) which is immersed in the pickling solution 1211, 1221, 1231 contained in each of the tanks<br>
121,	122, 123.<br>
In addition to the pickling tanks 121, 122, 123, the pickling apparatus shown in Figure 1 includes a recirculation circuit 13 and a regeneration circuit 14 for the pickling solution 1211, 1221, 1231.<br>
The recirculation circuit 13 includes a plurality of storage tanks 131, 132, 133 that are each linked to a pickling tank 121,<br>
122,	123 by means of units for pumping and heating using<br>
exchangers 1311, 1321, 1331.<br>
The storage tanks .131, 132, 133 are also connected by ducts 1312, 1323, such as to arrange them in the pickling apparatus in the<br>
direction opposite the running direction 3 of the strip 2 in the pickling apparatus 1.<br>
The regeneration circuit 14 includes a pyrohydrolysis unit 141 to transform the iron chlorides formed during acid corrosion into iron oxides, and a recovery tank 142 to collect oxides in tanks. The pyrohydrolysis unit 141 is connected to the first storage tank 133 and to the last storage tank 131 encountered in the running direction 3 of the strip 2 in the apparatus 1. Moreover, the recovery tank of the tanks 142 is only connected to the pyrohydrolysis unit 141, such that the iron chloride-rich pickling solution is captured in the first circulation tank 133, then regenerated in the pyrohydrolysis unit 141 by means of reactions 6, 7, where the iron chlorides are transformed into oxides:<br>
(Equation Removed) <br>
The pickling solution thus regenerated is then returned to the<br>
last circulation tank 131.<br>
The acid concentration balances between the different tanks 121,<br>
122, 123 are defined in a known manner by the flow of pickling<br>
solution 1211, 1221, 1231 moved by the strip 2 running from tank<br>
to tank (i.e. from tank 123 to tank 121 via tank 122), and by the<br>
rate of reverse cascade between the storage tanks 131, 132, 133<br>
(i.e. from tank 131 to tank 133 via tank 132).<br>
Extra regenerated acid and, if necessary, new acid 135 is added<br>
to the circulation tank 131.<br>
The free-acid concentration is therefore highest in the last<br>
pickling tank 121 where it can reach 200 g/1 and drops in the<br>
upstream tanks 122, 123, where it only reaches a few tens of g/1<br>
in the first tank 123. Correspondingly, the pumping and reheating<br>
unit 1331 makes it possible to maintain a heating power that is<br>
greater in the first tank 123 in order to reheat the strip 2 and to ensure it is pickled despite the low acid concentration.<br>
Once the scale has been eliminated by fragmentation of the scale by acid corrosion, the acid solution may start to corrode the bare strip 2, in particular if the strip 2 stops running and remains for- an extended period in the pickling tanks 121, 122, 123. This unwanted corrosion, commonly known as "over pickling" has the following effects:<br>
-	Loss of weight,<br>
-Variation in surface roughness,<br>
-	Change of coloration,<br>
-	Creation of surface marks,<br>
-	Excessive generation of hydrogen, which may accumulate locally<br>
and create an explosion risk.<br>
To avoid this, an inhibitor is usually added to the pickling solution 1211, 1221, 1231. Although a correct initial titration of this inhibitor does prevent all risk of over-pickling during normal operation of the apparatus 1, it may be inadequate if the strip stops running and remains for an extended period in the pickling tanks .<br>
Following acid pickling, the strip 2 must be rinsed to remove the acid and the iron chlorides present on the surfaces of the strip 2. Rinsing is generally performed in a rinsing unit 15, such as the one shown in Figure 4. This is a rinsing unit classically used in continuous pickling lines. This rinsing unit 15 includes:<br>
-	batteries of spray bars 151, 152, 153, 154, 155, that are<br>
arranged such that they can spray both faces of the strip 2 being<br>
pickled as it is running through the rinsing unit 15,<br>
- a plurality, of flow tanks 1511, 1521, 1531, 1541, 1551, each of which is arranged beneath a spray bar 151, 152, 153, 154, 155<br>
respectively to recover the water sprayed by the bars  151, 152, 153, 154, 155, each of the flow tanks 1521, 1531, 1541, 1551 overflowing into its neighboring tank forming a cascade flowing in the direction opposite to the running direction 3 of the strip 2, and<br>
- Roller drier devices 1501, 1502 placed at the entrance and exit of the rinsing unit 15, as well as roller drier devices 1512, 1523, 1534, 1545 placed between each battery of bars 151, 152, 153, 154, 155.<br>
Rinsing is usually performed by a counter-current cascade operating as follows: the strip -2. passes through the rinsing unit 15, where it is sprayed, on both faces, with water, preferably demineralized, by batteries of spray bars  151,  152,  153,  154, 155. The roller drier devices prevent the strip 2 from drawing acid diluted in the water.<br>
The water flowing beneath each battery 151, 152, 153, 154, 155 is recovered in its corresponding flow tank 1511, 1521, 1531, 1541, 1551, the overflow of each tank 15,11, 1521, 1531, 1541, 1551 flowing into its neighboring tank in the direction opposite to the running direction 3 of the strip 2.<br>
Each flow tank 1511, 1521, 1531, 1541, 1551 is also fitted with a recirculation circuit 1510, 1520, 1530, 1540,. 1501, 1502 each of which includes a pump 15101, 15201, 15301, 15401, 15501. The now acid-rich rinsing water 15510 is recovered in the first flow tank 1511 encountered in the running direction 3 of. the strip 2, then discharged. Extra demineralized water 15510 is situated in line with the final flow tank 1551 encountered.<br>
Generally, following the acid pickling and rinsing stages, the surface characteristics of a pickled and rinsed strip are analyzed.   This makes it possible to make an'.initial assessment of the quality of the operations performed and, depending on<br>
these results, to correct or optimize certain parameters such as the strip running speed V and parameters related to the oxide fragmentation, acid pickling and rinsing processes. In general, these surface characteristics are defined in accordance with the following characteristics:<br>
-	a well pickled strip has a visibly uniform appearance with<br>
minor variations in roughness over the width and length of the strip,<br>
-	an "under pickled" strip has brown or grey marks that are quite<br>
easy to detect and located across the width of the strip, there<br>
being major variations -in surface condition between the correctly,<br>
and inadequately pickled zones,<br>
-	an "over pickled" strip has a grey appearance, for example<br>
following a prolonged stoppage in the pickling tanks. This grey<br>
appearance is easy to detect on visual inspection.<br>
However, more subtle visual defects due to inadequate settings for running speed, inhibitor concentration, temperature or acid concentration may not be visible to the naked eye and require high-performance image capture and analysis means. Roughness variation analyses may also be used in addition to appearance analysis.<br>
Consequently, a continuous pickling operation for steel strip in an acid medium on a continuous pickling line, such as the one shown in Figure 1, requires the management of a significant number of adjustable parameters relating to the running speed of the strip in the apparatus 1, the performance of oxide fragmentation in the fragmentation system 11, the performance of actual' pickling in the pickling system 12, and the* performance of rinsing in the rinsing unit 15.<br>
Japanese patent application JP 56-136982 proposes a control system limited to measuring only the density of the pickling  solution which controls the opening and closing of a valve for<br>
 adding new acid. The acid concentration is calculated solely using this measurement of the density of the pickling solution, applying empirical formulas.  Other acid bath control parameters, such as temperature, are not taken into account. The control system described in JP 56-13-6982 is however inadequate: firstly, the reduction in acid concentration due to the chemical reactions 1 to 4 mentioned above is a slow process, and, secondly, the addition of fresh acid involves a significant time constant, resulting in very. significant fluctuations in the controlled variable.<br>
In this field, patent. US 6,396,280 is also known, which describes a control system for acid concentration, with which it is possible to continuously measure acid concentration in two consecutive tanks, which makes it possible to measure extra acid doses.  Although similar in principle to patent JP 56-136982, the American patent US 6,396,280 claims to limit the fluctuations in acid concentration.  However, only one parameter is monitored, and the result of the pickling operation is not taken into account as a control parameter.<br>
Patent application US 2002/0130666 describes a complete measurement system outside the pickling tank. This system, which is fitted with a temperature sensor and a conductivity meter, makes it possible to measure the density of the pickling solution by means of variations in the level of liquid in a column. This system effectively makes it possible to change the performance of continuous pickling, but it does not identify the relative impact of concentrations of acid and iron chlorides in the measurements. On the other hand, American patent US 5,175,502 describes a more precise system intended to identify the effects of the acid concentration and iron chloride concentrations by measuring, at a controlled temperature, the density of the undiluted pickling solution coming from a pickling' tank, and the conductivity of the<br>
same pickling solution, but diluted in a controlled manner with water. Conductivity varies little with the iron chloride concentration for low acid concentrations (for example around 25. g/1). Conductivity measured in this way is then considered to be independent of the iron chloride content, and therefore representative only of HC1 content. Knowing the dilution rate used for the measurement, it is then easy to extrapolate the acid concentration in the pickling tank and to calculate the iron-chloride concentration. However, the techniques implemented to measure this acid concentration do not allow this concentration to be controlled.<br>
There is nothing in the systems of the prior art described above that make it possible to optimize the pickling operation as a whole.<br>
To overcome this, the person skilled in the art knows a pickling method controlled by a global process that manages the pickling operation as a whole. Thus, patent US 6,419,756 describes a method for pickling a rolled metal strip running through a pickling apparatus, which includes:<br>
-	Adjustment of the pickling parameters by an operator, for example the temperature of the pickling solution<br>
-	Using an optical measuring instrument to measure defects in the. metal strip, which are sorted into different categories of defects and counted by a classifier to determine the frequency of occurrence of these types of faults;<br>
-	Sending these defect category occurrence frequencies to an * evaluator, which may be a fuzzy evaluator, a neural network or a neural fuzzy evaluator; and finally<br>
-	Evaluation by the evaluator of the result of pickling, which is a function of the pickling adjustment parameters, on the basis of which the evaluator determines instructions for at least one of • the pickling adjustment parameters.<br>
 <br>
 Such a system has the drawback of acting on any one of the adjustment parameters. In the embodiment described in patent US 6,419,756, this is preferably the temperature of the pickling solution. Such a modification has the major drawback of not having an immediate effect on account of the inertia inherent in a pickling apparatus.<br>
This invention therefore relates to a pickling method that overcomes the drawbacks of the prior art by implementing a global control process that acts directly on the strip running speed by reducing it in steps, and that does not change the adjustment parameters of. the pickling.  This invention also relates to an apparatus for implementing the method according to the invention. More specifically, this invention relates to a pickling method for a metal strip running continuously through a continuous pickling line apparatus, which includes successively a fragmentation stage for oxides formed on the surface of said strip during hot rolling, an acid pickling stage, a strip rinsing stage, and. a drying stage, the strip being driven at a running speed V in said apparatus in a longitudinal running direction perpendicular to the width of the strip, the strip running speed V being controlled by an uncoiling and coiling unit, and each of the stages of pickling being controlled by actuators that can act on the adjustment parameters of the pickling line, the action or absence of action of an actuator on a given adjustment parameter being identified by a status datum.<br>
The pickling method according to the invention also includes a global process for controlling pickling, which implements:<br>
-	the continuous measurement of at least some of the pickling adjustment parameters, said measurement being implemented during pickling;<br>
-	a command phase which is implemented during pickling, during which the global control process defines and sends optimized<br>
 <br>
command instructions to all of the actuators using a predictive control system; and<br>
-	continuous inspection of the surface of the strip.. According to the invention, the global process for controlling the pickling method includes:<br>
-	a prior preparation phase, which is implemented upstream or at the start of pickling, during which the global control process defines and sends pre-adjustment instructions to all of the actuators using an analytical model, which may be associated with a predictive control system;<br>
-	the continuous calculation of at least some.of the pickling adjustment parameters, said calculation being implemented during pickling; and<br>
-	the continuous inspection of the surface of the strip defines and sends, in the event of under-pickling, an alarm instruction to the command phase, which reduces stepwise the strip running speed V to a corrected running speed Vcor, the running speed V being reduced stepwise until this defect is no longer detected and no longer triggers an alarm instruction.<br>
In this invention, actuator status datum means a datum that contains the operating or not-operating adjustment status of the actuator.<br>
In this invention, analytical model means a model of the adjustment parameters, that is realized either using equations or predetermined pre-adjustment tables.<br>
The use of an analytical model and a predictive control system has the advantage of making it possible to determine pickling speeds as a function of the adjustment parameters and the measurements of these parameters more precisely than with neural or fuzzy or neural fuzzy models, as in patent US' 6,419,756, and without the need for learning.<br>
 <br>
 Advantageously, the predictive model of the global control process corrects the command instructions sent to all of the actuators apart from the strip running speed V, as a function of the correction made to the running speed Vcor,   and such as to maintain the quality of the evaluation made during inspection of the surface of the strip.<br>
Advantageously, the continuous inspection of the surface of the strip also results in the event of detection of defective rinsing, in a stepwise pH adjustment of the rinsing water, until the defect is no longer detected.<br>
Advantageously, calculation makes it possible to determine the acid and iron concentrations in the pickling solution, that are, used during acid pickling.<br>
Advantageously, the preparation phase includes the following operations:<br>
-	receiving status data from the actuators, operating data, and target values for the adjustment parameters established by the analytical model to optimize strip pickling;<br>
-	establishing pre-adjustment instructions for each actuator;<br>
-	sending each actuator these pre-adjustment instructions;<br>
-	establishing the input data for the command phase;<br>
-	sending this input data to the command phase.<br>
In this invention, operating data means the data on the strip to be pickled, the size of the strip, the steel grade of the strip, or even data on the scale formed during hot rolling (nature of oxides- formed, quantity, for example).<br>
According to one particularly advantageous embodiment of the preparation phase of the method according to the invention, the analytical model includes an analytical sub-model associated with each actuator to define said pre-adjustment instruction for the adjustment parameter on which the related actuator acts.<br>
 <br>
Advantageously, the command phase- includes the following operations:<br>
-	receiving continuously and in teal time status data from the actuators, information from the nieasurement and calculation means, and input data for the coriunand phase established during the preparation phase;<br>

 <br>
 surface condition measurement system and the surface appearance inspection system also detects said defect.<br>
