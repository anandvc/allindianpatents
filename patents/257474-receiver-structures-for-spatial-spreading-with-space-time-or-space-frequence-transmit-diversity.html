I. Claim of Priority under 35 U.S.C. 119<br>
[0001] The present Application for Patent claims priority to Provisional Application<br>
Serial No. 60/607,371, entitled "Steering Diversity with Space-Time Transmit Diversity<br>
for a Wireless Communication System," filed September 3, 2004; and Provisional<br>
Application Serial No. 60/608,226, entitled "Steering Diversity with Space-Time and<br>
Space-Frequency Transmit Diversity Schemes for a Wireless Communication System,"<br>
filed September 8, 2004, all assigned to the assignee hereof and hereby expressly<br>
incorporated by reference herein.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
II. Field<br>
[0002] The present invention relates generally to communication, and more specifically<br>
to techniques for processing data in a multiple-antea communication system.<br>
III. Background<br>
[0003] A multi-antea communication system employs multiple (NT) transmit<br>
anteas and one or more (N&amp;) receive anteas for data transmission. The NT transmit<br>
anteas may be used to increase system throughput by transmitting different data from<br>
the anteas or to improve reliability by transmitting data redundantly.<br>
[0004] In the multi-antea communication system, a propagation path exists between<br>
each pair of transmit and receive anteas. NT-NR different propagation paths are<br>
formed between the NT transmit anteas and the NR receive anteas. These<br>
propagation paths may experience different chael conditions (e.g., different fading,<br>
multipath, and interference effects) and may achieve different signal-to-noise-andinterference<br>
ratios (SNRs). The chael responses of the NT-NR propagation paths may<br>
thus vary from path to path. For a dispersive communication chael, the chael<br>
response for each propagation path also varies across frequency. If the chael<br>
conditions vary over time, then the chael responses for the propagation paths likewise<br>
vary over time.<br>
[0005] Transmit diversity refers to the redundant transmission of data across space,<br>
frequency, time, or a combination of these three dimensions to improve reliability for<br>
the data transmission. One goal of transmit diversity is to maximize diversity for the<br>
data transmission across as many dimensions as possible to achieve robust performance.<br>
Another goal is to simplify the processing for transmit diversity at both a transmitter and<br>
a receiver.<br>
[0006] There is therefore a need in the art for techniques to process data for transmit<br>
diversity in a multi-antea communication system.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0007] Techniques for transmitting and receiving data using a combination of transmit<br>
diversity schemes to improve performance are described herein. In an embodiment, a<br>
transmitting entity processes one or more (No) data symbol streams and generates<br>
multiple (Nc) coded symbol streams. Each data symbol stream may be sent as a single<br>
coded symbol stream or as two coded symbol streams using, e.g., space-time transmit<br>
diversity (STTD), space-frequency transmit diversity (SFTD), or orthogonal transmit<br>
diversity (OTD). The transmitting entity may perform spatial spreading on the NC<br>
coded symbol streams and generate NT transmit symbol streams. Additionally or<br>
alternatively, the transmitting entity may perform continuous beamforming on the NT<br>
transmit symbol streams in either the time domain or the frequency domain. These<br>
various transmit diversity schemes are described below.<br>
[0008] A receiving entity obtains received symbols for the data transmission sent by the<br>
transmitting entity. The receiving entity derives an effective chael response matrix,<br>
e.g., based on received pilot symbols. This matrix includes the effects of the spatial<br>
spreading and/or continuous beamforming, if performed by the transmitting entity. In<br>
an embodiment, the receiving entity forms an overall chael response matrix based on<br>
the effective chael response matrix and in accordance with the STTD encoding<br>
scheme used by the transmitting entity. The receiving entity then derives a spatial filter<br>
matrix based on the overall chael response matrix and in accordance with, e.g., a<br>
minimum mean square error (MMSE) technique or a chael correlation matrix<br>
inversion (CCMI) technique. The receiving entity then performs spatial processing on a<br>
vector of received symbols for each 2-symbol interval with the spatial filter matrix to<br>
obtain a vector of detected symbols for the 2-symbol interval. The detected symbols are<br>
estimates of the transmitted coded symbols. The receiving entity performs postprocessing<br>
(e.g., conjugation) on the detected symbols, if needed, to obtain recovered<br>
data symbols, which are estimates of the transmitted data symbols.<br>
[0009] In another embodiment, the receiving entity derives a spatial filter matrix based<br>
on the effective chael response matrix. The receiving entity then performs spatial<br>
processing on the received symbols for each symbol period with the spatial filter matrix<br>
to obtain detected symbols for that symbol period. The receiving entity also performs<br>
post-processing on the detected symbols, if needed, to obtain estimates of data symbols.<br>
The receiving entity combines multiple estimates obtained for each data symbol sent<br>
with STTD and generates a single estimate for the data symbol.<br>
[0010] Various aspects and embodiments of the invention are described in further detail<br>
below.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0018] The word "exemplary" is used herein to mean "serving as an example, instance,<br>
or illustration." Any embodiment described herein as "exemplary" is not necessarily to<br>
be construed as preferred or advantageous over other embodiments.<br>
[0019] The data transmission and reception techniques described herein may be used<br>
for multiple-input single-output (MISO) and multiple-input multiple-output (MDVIO)<br>
transmissions. A MISO transmission utilizes multiple transmit anteas and a single<br>
receive antea. A MDvIO transmission utilizes multiple transmit anteas and multiple<br>
receive anteas. These techniques may also be used for single-carrier and multi-carrier<br>
communication systems. Multiple carriers may be obtained with orthogonal frequency<br>
division multiplexing (OFDM), some other multi-carrier modulation techniques, or<br>
some other construct. OFDM effectively partitions the overall system bandwidth into<br>
multiple (Np) orthogonal frequency subbands, which are also called tones, subcarriers,<br>
bins, and frequency chaels. With OFDM, each subband is associated with a<br>
respective subcarrier that may be modulated with data,<br>
[0020] Transmit diversity may be achieved using various schemes including STTD,<br>
SFTD, OTD, spatial spreading, continuous beamforming, and so on. STTD transmits<br>
each pair of data symbols from two anteas on one subband in two symbol periods to<br>
achieve space and time diversity. SFTD transmits each pair of data symbols from two<br>
anteas on two subbands in one symbol period to achieve space and frequency<br>
diversity. OTD transmits each pair of data symbols from two anteas on one subband<br>
in two symbol periods using two orthogonal codes to achieve space and tune diversity.<br>
As used herein, a data symbol is a modulation symbol for traffic/packet data, a pilot<br>
symbol is a modulation symbol for pilot (which is data that is known a priori by both<br>
the transmitting and receiving entities), a modulation symbol is a complex value for a<br>
point in a signal constellation for a modulation scheme (e.g., M-PSK or M-QAM), and a<br>
symbol is any complex value.<br>
[0021] Spatial spreading refers to the transmission of a symbol from multiple transmit<br>
anteas simultaneously, possibly with different amplitudes and/or phases determined<br>
by a steering vector used for that symbol. Spatial spreading is also called steering<br>
diversity, transmit steering, pseudo-random transmit steering, and so on. Spatial<br>
spreading may be used in combination with STTD, SFTD, OTD, and/or continuous<br>
beamforming to improve performance.<br>
[0022] Continuous beamforming refers to the use of different beams across the NF<br>
subbands. The beamforming is continuous in that the beams change in a gradual instead<br>
of abrupt maer across the subbands. Continuous beamforming may be performed in<br>
the frequency domain by multiplying the symbols for each subband with a beamforming<br>
matrix for that subband. Continuous beamforming may also be performed in the time<br>
domain by applying different cyclic or circular delays for different transmit anteas.<br>
[0023] Transmit diversity may also be achieved using a combination of schemes. For<br>
example, transmit diversity may be achieved using a combination of either STTD or<br>
SFTD and either spatial spreading or continuous beamforming. As another example,<br>
transmit diversity may be achieved using a combination of STTD or SFTD, spatial<br>
spreading, and continuous beamforming.<br>
[0024] FIG. 1 shows a block diagram of an embodiment of a multi-antea transmitting<br>
entity 110. For this embodiment, transmitting entity 110 uses a combination of STTD,<br>
spatial spreading, and continuous beamforming for data transmission. A transmit (TX)<br>
data processor 112 receives and processes ND data streams and provides ND data symbol<br>
streams, where ND1. TX data processor 112 may process each data stream<br>
independently or may jointly process multiple data streams together. For example, TX<br>
data processor 112 may format, scramble, encode, interleave, and symbol map each data<br>
stream in accordance with a coding and modulation scheme selected for that data<br>
stream. A TX STTD processor 120 receives the ND data symbol streams, performs<br>
STTD processing or encoding on at least one data symbol stream, and provides NC<br>
streams of coded symbols, where Nc  ND. In general, TX STTD processor 120 may<br>
process one or more data symbol streams with STTD, SFTD, OTD, or some other<br>
transmit diversity scheme. Each data symbol stream may be sent as one coded symbol<br>
stream or multiple coded symbol streams, as described below.<br>
[0025] A spatial spreader 130 receives and multiplexes the coded symbols with pilot<br>
symbols, performs spatial spreading by multiplying the coded and pilot symbols with<br>
steering matrices, and provides NT transmit symbol streams for the NT transmit<br>
anteas, where NT  Nc. Each transmit symbol is a complex value to be sent on one<br>
subband in one symbol period from one transmit antea. NT modulators (Mod) 132a<br>
through 132t receive the NT transmit symbol streams. For an OFDM system, each<br>
modulator 132 performs OFDM modulation on its transmit symbol stream and provides<br>
a stream of time-domain samples. Each modulator 132 may also apply a cyclic delay<br>
for each OFDM symbol. NT modulators 132a through 132t provide NT streams of timedomain<br>
samples to NT transmitter units (TMTR) 134a through 134t, respectively. Each<br>
transmitter unit 134 conditions (e.g., converts to analog, amplifies, filters, and frequency<br>
upconverts) its sample stream and generates a modulated signal. NT modulated signals<br>
from NT transmitter units 134a through 134t are transmitted from NT transmit anteas<br>
136a through 136t, respectively.<br>
[0026] Controller 140 controls the operation at transmitting entity 110. Memory unit<br>
142 stores data and/or program codes used by controller 140.<br>
[0027] FIG. 2 shows a block diagram of an embodiment of a single-antea receiving<br>
entity 150x and a multi-antea receiving entity 150y. At single-antea receiving<br>
entity 150x, an antea 152x receives the NT transmitted signals and provides a received<br>
signal to a receiver unit (RCVR) 154x. Receiver unit 154x performs processing<br>
complementary to that performed by transmitter units 134 and provides a stream of<br>
received samples to a demodulator (Demod) 156x. For an OFDM system, demodulator<br>
156x performs OFDM demodulation on the received samples to obtain received<br>
symbols, provides received data symbols to a detector 158, and provides received pilot<br>
symbols to a chael estimator 162. Chael estimator 162 derives an effective chael<br>
response estimate for a single-input single-output (SISO) chael between transmitting<br>
entity 110 and receiving entity 150x for each subband used for data transmission.<br>
Detector 158 performs data detection on the received data symbols for each subband<br>
based on the effective SISO chael response estimate for that subband and provides<br>
recovered data symbols for the subband. An RX data processor 160 processes (e.g.,<br>
symbol demaps, deinterleaves, and decodes) the recovered data symbols and provides<br>
decoded data.<br>
[0028] At multi-antea receiving entity 150y, NR anteas 152a through 152r receive<br>
the NT transmitted signals, and each antea 152 provides a received signal to a<br>
respective receiver unit 154. Each receiver unit 154 processes its received signal and<br>
provides a received sample stream to an associated demodulator 156, Each demodulator<br>
156 performs OFDM demodulation on its received sample stream, provides received<br>
data symbols to an RX spatial processor 170, and provides received pilot symbols to a<br>
chael estimator 166. Chael estimator 166 derives a chael response estimate for<br>
the actual or effective MIMO chael between transmitting entity 110 and receiving<br>
entity 150y for each subband used for data transmission. A matched filter generator 168<br>
derives a spatial filter matrix for each subband based on the chael response estimate<br>
for that subband. RX spatial processor 170 performs receiver spatial processing (or<br>
spatial matched filtering) on the received data symbols for each subband with the spatial<br>
filter matrix for that subband and provides detected symbols for the subband. An RX<br>
STTD processor 172 performs post-processing on the detected symbols and provides<br>
recovered data symbols. An RX data processor 174 processes (e.g., symbol demaps,<br>
deinterleaves, and decodes) the recovered data symbols and provides decoded data.<br>
[0029] Controllers 180x and 180y control the operation at receiving entities 150x and<br>
150y, respectively. Memory units 182x and 182y store data and/or program codes used<br>
by controllers 180x and 180y, respectively.<br>
1. Transmitter Processing<br>
[0030] Transmitting entity 110 may transmit any number of data symbol streams with<br>
STTD and any number of data symbol streams without STTD, depending on the number<br>
of transmit and receive anteas available for data transmission. The STTD encoding<br>
for one data symbol stream may be performed as follows. For each pair of data symbols<br>
Ja and A\ to be sent in two symbol periods of the data symbol stream, TX STTD<br>
processor 120 generates two vectors Sj = [sa 5jr and s2=0b -s]r, where "  "<br>
denotes the complex conjugate and " T " denotes the transpose. Alternatively, TX<br>
STTD processor 120 may generate two vectors s, = 0a -s]T and s2 = [sb s]T for<br>
each pair of data symbols sa and sb. For both STTD encoding schemes, each vector<br>
s,, for t = I, 2, includes two coded symbols to be sent from NT transmit anteas in one<br>
symbol period, where NT i 2. Vector st is sent in the first symbol period, and vector<br>
s_2 is sent in the next symbol period. Each data symbol is included in both vectors and<br>
is thus sent over two symbol periods. The m-th coded symbol stream is sent in the m-th<br>
element of the two vectors s, and S2. For clarity, the following description is for the<br>
STTD encoding scheme with =[5 sb]T and s2=[sb -sJT. For this STTD<br>
encoding scheme, the first coded symbol stream includes coded symbols ss and s, and<br>
the second coded symbol stream includes coded symbols sb and - s.<br>
[0031] Table 1 lists four configurations that may be used for data transmission. An<br>
NDxNc configuration denotes the transmission of ND data symbol streams as NC<br>
coded symbol streams, where ND  1 and Nc  ND. The first column identifies the<br>
four configurations. For each configuration, the second column indicates the number of<br>
data symbol streams being sent, and the third column indicates the number of coded<br>
symbol streams. The fourth column lists the ND data symbol streams for each<br>
configuration, the fifth column lists the coded symbol stream(s) for each data symbol<br>
stream, the sixth column gives the coded symbol to be sent in the first symbol period<br>
(t ~ I) for each coded symbol stream, and the seventh column gives the coded symbol<br>
to be sent in the second symbol period (t-2) for each coded symbol stream. The<br>
number of data symbols sent in each 2-symbol interval is equal to twice the number of<br>
data symbol streams. The eighth column indicates the number of transmit anteas<br>
required for each configuration, and the ninth column indicates the number of receive<br>
anteas required for each configuration. As shown in Table 1, for each data symbol<br>
stream that is sent as one coded symbol stream without STTD, the data symbol sent in<br>
the second symbol period (t = 2) is conjugated to match the conjugation performed on<br>
the data symbols in the STTD encoded data symbol stream.<br>
(Table Remove) <br>
[0032] As an example, for the 2x3 configuration, two data symbol streams are sent as<br>
three coded symbol streams. The first data symbol stream is STTD encoded to generate<br>
two coded symbol streams. The second data symbol stream is sent without STTD as the<br>
third coded symbol stream. Coded symbols and are sent from at least three<br>
transmit anteas in the first symbol period, and coded are sent<br>
in the second symbol period. A receiving entity uses at least two receive anteas to<br>
recover the two data symbol streams.<br>
[0033] Table 1 shows four configurations that may be used for data transmission<br>
whereby each configuration has at least one STTD encoded data symbol stream. Other<br>
configurations may also be used for data transmission. In general, any number of data<br>
symbol streams may be sent as any number of coded symbol streams from any number<br>
of transmit anteas, where ND  1 , Nc  ND , NT  Nc , and NR  ND .<br>
[0034] The transmitting entity may process the coded symbols for spatial spreading and<br>
continuous beamforming as follows:<br>
where s,(k) is an Nc xl vector with NC coded symbols to be sent on subband k in<br>
symbol period t;<br>
G(k) is an Nc xNc diagonal matrix with Nc gain values along the diagonal for<br>
the NC coded symbols in s,(k) and zeros elsewhere;<br>
V(£) is an NT x Nc steering matrix for spatial spreading for subband k;<br>
B(fc) is an NT x NT diagonal matrix for continuous beamforming for subband<br>
x, (k) is an NT x 1 vector with NT transmit symbols to be sent from the NT<br>
transmit anteas on subband k in symbol period t.<br>
[0035] Vector st contains NC coded symbols to be sent in the first symbol period, and<br>
vector s2 contains NC coded symbols to be sent in the second symbol period. Vectors<br>
Sj and s2 may be formed as shown in Table 1 for the four configurations. For example,<br>
Sj=[ja sb sc]r and s2 = |X - ]r for the 2x3 configuration.<br>
[0036] The gain matrix G(&amp;) determines the amount of transmit power to use for each<br>
of the NC coded symbol streams. The total transmit power available for transmission<br>
may be denoted as Ptotai- If equal transmit power is used for the NC coded symbol<br>
streams, then the diagonal elements of G(fc) have the same value, which is /PtoW /Nc .<br>
If equal transmit power is used for the ND data symbol streams, then the diagonal<br>
10<br>
elements of G(k) may or may not be equal depending on the configuration. The Nc<br>
gain values in G(fc) may be defined to achieve equal transmit power for the ND data<br>
symbol streams being sent simultaneously. As an example, for the 2x3 configuration,<br>
the first data symbol stream is sent as two coded symbol streams and the second data<br>
symbol stream is sent as one coded symbol stream. To achieve equal transmit power for<br>
the two data symbol streams, a 3x3 gain matrix G(k) may include gain values of<br>
streams. Each coded symbol in the third coded symbol stream is then scaled by<br>
VPtotai / 2 and is transmitted with twice the power as the other two coded symbols sent<br>
in the same symbol period. The NC coded symbols for each symbol period may also be<br>
scaled to utilize the maximum transmit power available for each transmit antea. In<br>
general, the elements of G(k) may be selected to utilize any amount of transmit power<br>
for the Nc coded symbol streams and to achieve any desired SNRs for the ND data<br>
symbol streams. The power scaling for each coded symbol stream may also be<br>
performed by scaling the columns of the steering matrix V(£) with appropriate gains.<br>
[0037] A given data symbol stream (denoted as {s}) may be sent as one coded symbol<br>
stream (denoted as {?}) in other maers. In one embodiment, the gain matrix G(fc)<br>
contains ones along the diagonal, and coded symbol stream {?} is transmitted at the<br>
same power level as the other coded symbol streams. For this embodiment, data symbol<br>
stream {s} is transmitted at lower transmit power than an STTD encoded data symbol<br>
stream and achieves a lower received SNR at the receiving entity. The coding and<br>
modulation for data symbol stream {s} may be selected to achieve the desired<br>
performance, e.g., the desired packet error rate. In another embodiment, each data<br>
symbol in data symbol stream {s} is repeated and transmitted in two symbol periods.<br>
As an example, for the 2x3 configuration, data symbol sc is sent in two symbol<br>
periods, then data symbol sd is sent in two symbol periods, and so on. Similar received<br>
SNRs for all ND data symbol streams may simplify processing (e.g., encoding) at both<br>
the transmitting and receiving entities.<br>
[0038] The steering matrix V(£) spatially spreads the NC coded symbols for each<br>
symbol period such that each coded symbol is transmitted from all NT transmit anteas<br>
and achieves spatial diversity. Spatial spreading may be performed with various types<br>
of steering matrices, such as Walsh matrices, Fourier matrices, pseudo-random matrices,<br>
and so on, which may be generated as described below. The same steering matrix V(£)<br>
is used for the two vectors Sj(£) and s2(fc) for each subband k. The same or different<br>
steering matrices may be used for different subbands. Different steering matrices may<br>
be used for different time intervals, where each time interval spans an integer multiple<br>
of two symbol periods for STTD.<br>
[0039] The matrix B(fc) performs continuous beamforming in the frequency domain.<br>
For an OFDM system, a different beamforming matrix may be used for each subband.<br>
The beamforming matrix for each subband k may be a diagonal matrix having the<br>
following form:<br>
where b,(k) is a weight for subband k of transmit antea i. The weight bt(k) may be<br>
defined as:<br>
(Table Remove) <br>
each value of k. The weights &amp;.(£) shown in equation (3) correspond to a progressive<br>
phase shift across the NF total subbands of each transmit antea, with the phase shift<br>
changing at different rates for the NT transmit anteas. These weights effectively form<br>
a different beam for each subband.<br>
[0040] Continuous beamforming may also be performed in the time domain as follows.<br>
For each symbol period, an Np-point inverse discrete Fourier transform (IDFT) is<br>
symbols for each transmit antea z to generate Np timedomain<br>
samples for that transmit antea. The NF time-domain samples for each<br>
transmit antea i are then cyclically or circularly delayed with a delay of T,. For<br>
example, T, may be defined as: T, = AT-(i-l), for i = l ... NT, where AT may be<br>
equal to one sample period, a fraction of a sample period, or more than one sample<br>
period. The time-domain samples for each antea are thus cyclically delayed by a<br>
different amount.<br>
[0041] For simplicity, the following description is for one subband, and the subband<br>
index k is dropped from the notations. The receiver spatial processing for each subband<br>
may be performed in the same maer, albeit with a spatial filter matrix obtained for<br>
that subband. The gain matrix G(fc) does not affect the receiver spatial processing and<br>
is omitted from the following description for clarity. The gain matrix G(fc) may also be<br>
viewed as being incorporated in the vectors s, and s2.<br>
2. Single-Antea Receiver Processing<br>
[0042] A single-antea receiving entity may receive a data transmission sent using the<br>
1x2 configuration. The received symbols from the single receive antea may be<br>
expressed as:<br>
The MISO chael response h is assumed to be constant over the two symbol periods<br>
for vectors s, and s2.<br>
[0043] The single-antea receiving entity may derive estimates of the two data<br>
symbols sa and ,vb, as follows:<br>
(Table Remove) <br>
detected symbols The receiving entity may also derive the detected symbols using MMSE processing<br>
described below.<br>
3. Multi- Antea Receiver Processing<br>
[0044] A multi-antea receiving entity may receive a data transmission sent using any<br>
of the configurations supported by the number of receive anteas available at that<br>
receiving entity, as shown in Table 1. The received symbols from the multiple receive<br>
anteas may be expressed as:<br>
where r, is an NR x 1 vector with NR received symbols for symbol period t;<br>
H is an NR x NT chael response matrix;<br>
H is an NR xNc effective chael response matrix; and<br>
n, is a noise vector for symbol period t.<br>
The receiving entity can typically obtain an estimate of H based on a pilot received<br>
from the transmitting entity. The receiving entity uses H to recover s, .<br>
[0045] The effective chael response matrix H may be expressed as:<br>
(Table Remove)<br>
 the chael gain for coded symbol stream m at receive antea j. The<br>
effective chael response matrix G.eff is dependent on the configuration used for data<br>
transmission and the number of receive anteas. The MIMO chael response matrix<br>
H and the effective chael response matrix Hejr are assumed to be constant over two<br>
symbol periods for vectors s, and s2.<br>
[0046] For the 1x2 configuration, the effective chael response matrix is an NR x2<br>
matrix that may be given as: Hejf = H • B V = [heffil hi2], where hej n is an effective<br>
chael response vector for coded symbol stream m. The multi-antea receiving entity<br>
may derive estimates of the two data symbols s&amp; and s\,, as follows:<br>
where h m is an estimate of heff m , for m = 1, 2 ;<br>
" H " denotes the conjugate transpose; and<br>
n" and n are post-processed noise for detected symbols sa and sb , respectively.<br>
The data symbols sa and 5b may also be recovered using other receiver spatial processing<br>
techniques, as described below.<br>
[0047] To facilitate the receiver spatial processing, a single data vector s may be<br>
formed for the 2No data symbols included in vectors Sj and s2 sent in two symbol<br>
periods. A single received vector r may also be formed for the 2Na received symbols<br>
included in vectors fj and r2 obtained in two symbol periods. The received vector r<br>
may then be expressed as:<br>
where r is a 2NR x 1 vector with 2NR received symbols obtained in two symbol periods;<br>
s is a 2ND xl vector with 2 data symbols sent in two symbol periods;<br>
Hnfl is a 2NRx2ND overall chael response matrix observed by the data<br>
symbols in s; and<br>
,, is a noise vector for the 2No data symbols.<br>
The overall chael response matrix H0,, contains twice the number of rows as the<br>
effective chael response matrix Heff and includes the effects of STTD, spatial<br>
spreading, and continuous beamforming performed by the transmitting entity. The<br>
elements of HaU are derived based on the elements of H , as described below.<br>
[0048] For the 2x3 configuration, the transmitting entity generates vectors<br>
T for four data symbols sasent in two symbol periods for two data symbol streams, as shown in Table 1. Each<br>
vector sr contains three coded symbols to be sent from the NT transmit anteas in one<br>
symbol period, where NT 3 for the 2x3 configuration.<br>
[0049] If the receiving entity is equipped with two receive anteas (NR = 2), then r,<br>
is a 2x1 vector with two received symbols for symbol period t, H is a 2xNT chael<br>
response matrix, and HeJ is a 2x3 effective chael response matrix. The effective<br>
chael response matrix for the 2x3 configuration with two receive anteas, which is<br>
denoted as H2xi, may be expressed as:<br>
'V,u V,, Eq(11)<br>
[0050] The received symbols for the first symbol period are denoted as rt = [ru r21] r ,<br>
and the received symbols for the second symbol period are denoted as r2 = [r, 2 r22] T ,<br>
where r} , is the received symbol from receive antea,/ in symbol period t. These four<br>
received symbols may be expressed as:<br>
With the above formulation, r may be expressed based on H;<br>
2x3 and s , as shown in<br>
equation (10). The matrix H,2x3 is formed from equation set (12) and using the<br>
property: r — h-s = r -h" -s. As shown in equation (13), the first two rows of<br>
contain all of the elements of H2x3 , and the last two rows of H,',23 contain the<br>
elements of H2,3 but rearranged and transformed (i.e., conjugated and/or inverted) due<br>
to the STTD encoding on the data symbols.<br>
[0052] For the 2x4 configuration, the transmitting entity generates vectors<br>
s, =[5a sb sc SA]T and s2 =[£ -s sA -s]r for two pairs of data symbols (5a and<br>
5b) and (sc and 5j) to be sent in two symbol periods for two data symbol streams. Each<br>
vector s, includes four coded symbols to be sent from the NT transmit anteas in one<br>
symbol period, where NT 4 for the 2x4 configuration.<br>
[0053] If the receiving entity is equipped with two receive anteas (NR = 2 ), then r,<br>
is a 2x1 vector with two received symbols for symbol period t, H is a 2xNT chael<br>
response matrix, and H is a 2x4 effective chael response matrix. The effective<br>
chael response matrix for the 2x4 configuration with two receive anteas, which is<br>
denoted as H2x4 , may be expressed as:<br>
(Table Remove) <br>
[0061] The multi-antea receiving entity can derive estimates of the transmitted data<br>
symbols using various receiver spatial processing techniques. These techniques include<br>
an MMSE technique, a CCMI technique (which is also commonly called a zero-forcing<br>
technique or a decorrelation technique), a partial-MMSE technique, and a partial-CCMI<br>
technique. For the MMSE and CCMI techniques, the receiving entity performs spatial<br>
matched filtering on 2 received symbols obtained in each 2-symbol interval. For the<br>
partial-MMSE and partial-CCMI techniques, the receiving entity performs spatial<br>
matched filtering on NR received symbols obtained in each symbol period.<br>
A. MMSE Receiver<br>
[0062] For the MMSE technique, the receiving entity derives a spatial filter matrix as<br>
where Hall is a 2NR x2ND matrix that is an estimate of Han ;<br>
(p is an autocovariance matrix of the noise vector nofl in equation (10); and<br>
Mmmse is a 2ND x2NR MMSE spatial filter matrix.<br>
[0063] The receiving entity may derive Hn,, in different maers depending on how<br>
pilot symbols are sent by the transmitting entity. For example, the receiving entity may<br>
obtain Heff , which is an estimate the effective chael response matrix Heff , based on<br>
symbols. The receiving entity may then derive HaU based on H , as<br>
shown in equation (19), (21), (23) or (25) for the four configurations given in Table 1.<br>
The receiving entity may also estimate the overall chael response matrix HnH directly<br>
based on received pilot symbols. In any case, the second equality in equation (26)<br>
assumes that the noise vector noi( is AWGN with zero mean and variance of a . The<br>
spatial filter matrix Mmmie minimizes the mean square error between the symbol<br>
estimates from the spatial filter matrix and the data symbols.<br>
[0064] The receiving entity performs MMSE spatial processing as follows:<br>
where is a 2NDxl vector with 2No detected symbols obtained for a 2-symbol<br>
interval with the MMSE technique;<br>
is the MMSE filtered noise.<br>
The symbol estimates from the spatial filter matrix Mmmje are uormalized estimates<br>
of the data symbols. The multiplication with the scaling matrix D provides normalized<br>
estimates of the data symbols.<br>
B. CCMI Receiver<br>
[0065] For the CCMI technique, the receiving entity derives a spatial filter matrix as<br>
follows:<br>
where Mccm, is a 2ND x2NR CCMI. spatial filter matrix.<br>
[0066] The receiving entity performs CCMI spatial processing as follows:<br>
= Mccmi-r ,<br>
C. Partial-MMSE Receiver<br>
[0067] For the partial-MMSE and partial-CCMI techniques, the receiving entity<br>
performs spatial matched filtering on the NR received symbols for each symbol period<br>
based on a spatial filter matrix for that symbol period. For each STTD encoded data<br>
symbol stream, the receiving entity obtains two estimates in two symbol periods for<br>
each data symbol sent in the stream and combines these two estimates to generate a<br>
single estimate for the data symbol. The partial-MMSE and partial-CCMI techniques<br>
may be used if the receiving entity is equipped with at least NC receive anteas, or<br>
NR  Nc . There should be at least as many receive anteas as the number of coded<br>
symbols transmitted at each symbol period, which is shown in Table 1 .<br>
[0068] For the partial-MMSE technique, the receiving entity derives a spatial filter<br>
matrix as follows:<br>
where Beff is an NR x Nc matrix that is an estimate of Heff ; and<br>
Mp-rome s an NC xNR MMSE spatial filter matrix for one symbol period.<br>
The effective chael response matrix H is dependent on the configuration used for<br>
data transmission and has the form shown in equation (8).<br>
[0069] The receiving entity performs MMSE spatial processing for each symbol period<br>
as follows:<br>
where |mmse, is an Nc xl vector with NC detected symbols obtained in symbol period t<br>
with the partial-MMSE technique;<br>
nm,,ue, is the MMSE filtered noise for symbol period t.<br>
[0070] The partial-MMSE processing provides two vectors |)mueil and |mmiei2 for the<br>
first and second symbol periods, respectively, which are estimates of vectors s, and s2,<br>
respectively. The detected symbols in vector |mmi
needed, to obtain estimates of the data symbols included in vector s2. As an example,<br>
for the 2x3 configuration, smmil,,i = C?a sb sc]r and smms
vector smmjl,2, si is conjugated to obtain a second estimate of s\» -5 is negated and<br>
conjugated to obtain a second estimate of sa, and sA is conjugated to obtain an estimate<br>
 [0071] For each STTD encoded data symbol stream, the partial-MMSE processing<br>
provides two detected symbols in two symbol periods for each data symbol sent in that<br>
stream. In particular, the partial-MMSE processing provides two estimates of sa and<br>
two estimates of s, for all four configurations in Table 1 and further provides two<br>
estimates of sc and two estimates of s&amp; for the 2x4 configuration. The two estimates of<br>
each data symbol may be combined to generate a single estimate of that data symbol.<br>
[0072] The two estimates of a data symbol sm may be combined using maximal ratio<br>
combining (MRC), as follows:<br>
where sm it is an estimate of data symbol sm obtained in symbol period t;<br>
ymtt istheSNRof ,ymi, ;and<br>
sm is a final estimate of data symbol sm.<br>
[0073] The estimate sm<l is obtained from coded symbol stream m in period></l>
where m, is the coded symbol stream from which sm t was obtained; and<br>
1m,, m, ig th6 mt "th diagonal element of Q defined above for equation (31).<br>
[0074] The two estimates of data symbol sm may also be linearly combined, as follows:<br>
Equation (34) provides the same performance as the MRC technique if the SNRs of the<br>
two estimates sm , and 5m 2 are equal but provides sub-optimal performance if the SNRs<br>
are not equal.<br>
 the receiving entity derives a spatial filter<br>
matrix for one symbol period as follows:<br>
where Mp,.ccm) is an Nc xNR CCMI spatial filter matrix for one symbol period.<br>
[0076] The receiving entity performs CCMI spatial processing for each symbol period<br>
as follows:<br>
 [0078] The partial-MMSE and partial-CCMI techniques may reduce delay (or latency)<br>
for data symbol streams sent without STTD. The partial-MMSE and partial-CCMI<br>
techniques may also reduce complexity of the spatial matched filtering since the spatial<br>
filter matrix for each symbol period has dimension of Nc xNR whereas the spatial filter<br>
matrix for each 2-symbol period interval has dimension of 2ND x2NR .<br>
4. Alternate STTP encoding scheme<br>
[0079] For clarity, the description above is for the case in which a pair of data symbols<br>
STTD encoded into two vectors sfo sb]T and s2=[ -]r. As<br>
noted above, the pair of data symbols sa and sb may also be STTD encoded into two<br>
vectors §,=[„ -s]T and s2 =[b s]r. The various vectors and matrices described<br>
above may be different for this alternate STTD encoding scheme.<br>
[0080] As an example, for the 2x4 configuration, the transmitting entity may generate<br>
vectors S[ = [5a -ib sc -sJT and s2 = [b -y sd s'c]T for two pairs of data symbols<br>
(sa and Sb) an(3 (c and SA) to be sent in two symbol periods for two data symbol streams.<br>
The data vector s may be given as s = [sa s sc s"d]T, the received vector r may be<br>
The vectors s,, s2 and s and the matrix HflH for the other configurations may be<br>
derived in similar maer as described above for the 2x4 configuration.<br>
[0081] For the alternate STTD encoding scheme, the receiving entity uses the matrix<br>
Hj, defined for the alternate STTD encoding scheme, instead of the matrix HaH<br>
defined for first STTD encoding scheme, to derive an MMSE spatial filter matrix or a<br>
CCMI spatial filter matrix. For the 2x4 configuration, the matrix HflH shown in<br>
equation (38) is used instead of the matrix H, shown in equation (23). The receiving<br>
entity then performs spatial matched filtering on the received vector r with the spatial<br>
filter matrix to obtain s, which is an estimate of s for the alternate STTD encoding<br>
scheme. The receiving entity then conjugates the symbols in s, as needed, to obtain the<br>
recovered data symbols.<br>
[0082] In general, the overall chael response matrix HflH is dependent on the maer<br>
in which the STTD encoding is performed by the transmitting entity and any other<br>
spatial processing performed by the transmitting entity. The receiving entity performs<br>
MMSE or CCMI processing in the same maer, albeit with the overall chael<br>
response matrix derived in the proper maer.<br>
[0083] The effective chael response matrix Hejr is the same for both STTD encoding<br>
schemes and is shown in equation (8). The receiving entity uses H to derive a<br>
partial-MMSE spatial filter matrix or a partial-CCMI spatial filter matrix. The receiving<br>
entity then performs spatial matched filtering on the received vector r, for each symbol<br>
period with the spatial filter matrix to obtain s,, which is an estimate of s, for the<br>
alternate STTD encoding scheme. The receiving entity then conjugates the detected<br>
symbols in s, as needed and further combines estimates as appropriate to obtain the<br>
recovered data symbols.<br>
5. Receiver Processing<br>
[0084] FIG. 3 shows a block diagram of an RX spatial processor 170a and an RX STTD<br>
processor 172a, which can implement the MMSE or CCMI technique. RX spatial<br>
processor 170a and RX STTD processor 172a are one embodiment of RX spatial<br>
processor 170 and RX STTD processor 172, respectively, for multi-antea receiving<br>
entity 150y in FIG. 2. Chael estimator 166 derives the effective chael response<br>
estimate H based on received pilot symbols, as described below. Matched filter<br>
generator 168 forms the overall chael response estimate Ho(, based on H and<br>
derives an MMSE or CCMI spatial filter matrix M for a 2-symbol interval based on<br>
jftoH, as shown in equation (26) or (28).<br>
[0085] Within RX spatial processor 170a, a pre-processor 310 obtains the received<br>
vector r, for each symbol period, conjugates the received symbols for the second<br>
symbol period of each 2-symbol interval, and forms the received vector r for each 2-<br>
symbol interval, as shown in equation (17). A spatial processor 320 performs spatial<br>
matched filtering on the received vector r with the spatial filter matrix M and provides<br>
vector s, as shown in equation (27) or (29). Within RX STTD processor 172a, an<br>
STTD post-processor 330 conjugates the symbols in vector s, as needed, and provides<br>
2No recovered data symbols for each 2-symbol interval. A demultiplexer (Demux) 340<br>
demultiplexes the recovered data symbols from STTD post-processor 330 onto ND<br>
recovered data symbol streams and provides these streams to RX data processor 174.<br>
[0086] FIG. 4 shows a block diagram of an RX spatial processor 170b and an RX STTD<br>
processor 172b, which can implement the partial-MMSE or partial-CCMI technique.<br>
RX spatial processor 170b and RX STTD processor 172b are another embodiment of<br>
RX spatial processor 170 and RX STTD processor 172, respectively. Chael estimator<br>
166 derives the effective chael response estimate H . Matched filter generator 168<br>
generates a partial-MMSE or partial-CCMI spatial filter matrix Mp for one symbol<br>
period based on Hejj-, as shown in equation (30) or (35).<br>
 [0087] Within RX spatial processor 170b, a spatial processor 420 performs spatial<br>
matched filtering on the received vector r, for each symbol period with the spatial filter<br>
matrix Mp for that symbol period and provides vector s,, as shown in equation (31) or<br>
(36). Within RX STTD processor 172b, an STTD post-processor 430 conjugates the<br>
detected symbols in vector s,, as needed, and provides Nc data symbol estimates for<br>
each symbol period. A combiner 432 combines two estimates for each data symbol sent<br>
with STTD, e.g., as shown in equation (32) or (34), and provides a single estimate for<br>
that data symbol. A demultiplexer 440 demultiplexes the recovered data symbols from<br>
combiner 432 onto ND recovered data symbol streams and provides these streams to RX<br>
data processor 174.<br>
[0088] FIG. 5 shows a process 500 for receiving a data transmission with the MMSE or<br>
CCMI technique. Received symbols are obtained for the data transmission, which<br>
includes at least one STTD encoded data symbol stream (block 510). An effective<br>
chael response matrix is obtained, e.g., based on received pilot symbols (block 512).<br>
An overall chael response matrix is formed based on the effective chael response<br>
matrix and in accordance with the STTD encoding scheme used for the data<br>
transmission (block 514). A spatial filter matrix is derived based on the overall chael<br>
response matrix and in accordance with, e.g., the MMSE or CCMI technique (block<br>
516). A vector of received symbols is formed for each 2-symbol interval (block 518).<br>
Spatial processing is performed on the vector of received symbols for each 2-symbol<br>
interval with the spatial filter matrix to obtain a vector of detected symbols for the 2-<br>
symbol interval (block 520). Post-processing (e.g., conjugation) is performed on the<br>
detected symbols, if needed, to obtain recovered data symbols (block 522).<br>
[0089] FIG. 6 shows a process 600 for receiving a data transmission with the partial-<br>
MMSE or parti al-CCMI technique. Received symbols are obtained for the data<br>
transmission, which includes at least one STTD encoded data symbol stream (block<br>
610). An effective chael response matrix is obtained, e.g., based on received pilot<br>
symbols (block 612). A spatial filter matrix is derived based on the effective chael<br>
response matrix and in accordance with, e.g., the MMSE or CCMI technique (block<br>
614). Spatial processing is performed on the received symbols for each symbol period<br>
with the spatial filter matrix to obtain detected symbols for the symbol period (block<br>
616). Post-processing (e.g., conjugation) is performed on the detected symbols, if<br>
needed, to obtain estimates of data symbols (block 618). Multiple estimates of each<br>
data symbol sent with STTD are combined to obtain a single estimate for the data<br>
symbol (block 620).<br>
6. SFTD and spatial spreading<br>
[0090] The transmitting entity may also use a combination of SFTD, spatial spreading,<br>
and possibly continuous bearnforming. For each configuration shown in Table 1, the<br>
transmitting entity may generate two vectors Sj and s_2 for 2No data symbols to be sent<br>
on two subbands in one symbol period for ND data symbol streams. The transmitting<br>
entity may spatially spread and send vector Sj on one subband in one symbol period and<br>
spatially spread and send vector s2 on another subband in the same symbol period. The<br>
two subbands are typically adjacent subbands. The receiving entity may derive the<br>
overall chael response matrix HaH as described above, except that the first NR rows<br>
of Hfl,, are for the first subband (instead of the first symbol period) and the last NR rows<br>
of Hfl// are for the second subband (instead of the second symbol period). The<br>
receiving entity may perform MMSE, CCMI, partial-MMSE, or partial-CCMI<br>
processing in the maer described above.<br>
7. Steering matrices for spatial spreading<br>
[0091] Various types of steering matrices may be used for spatial spreading. For<br>
example, the steering matrix V may be a Walsh matrix, a Fourier matrix, or some other<br>
matrix. A 2x2 Walsh matrix W2x2 be expressed as W =<br>
An NxN Fourier matrix DNxN has element dlim in the n-th row of the m-th column,<br>
which may be expressed as:<br>
Fourier matrices of any square dimension (e.g., 2, 3, 4, 5, and so on) may be formed.<br>
[0092] A Walsh matrix WNxN, a Fourier matrix DNxN, or any other matrix may be used<br>
as a base matrix BNxN to form other steering matrices. For an N xN base matrix, each<br>
of rows 2 through N of the base matrix may be independently multiplied with one of M<br>
different possible scalars. MN-1 different steering matrices may be obtained from MN<br>
different permutations of the M scalars for the N -1 rows. For example, each of rows 2<br>
through N may be independently multiplied with a scalar of +1, -1, +j, or -j, where<br>
j = V-T. For N = 4, 64 different steering matrices may be generated from a base<br>
matrix B4X4 with the four different scalars. Additional steering matrices may be<br>
generated with other scalars, e.g., e±J3"'4, e±J"'4, e±J', and so on. In general, each<br>
row of the base matrix may be multiplied with any scalar having the form eje, where 9<br>
may be any phase value. NxN steering matrices may be generated from the NxN<br>
base matrix as V(i) = gN -B'NxN, where gN = 1/VN and B'NXN is the i-th steering matrix<br>
generated with the base matrix BNxN. The scaring by gN =1/VN ensures that each<br>
column of V(i) has unit power.<br>
[0093] The steering matrices may also be generated in a pseudo-random maer. The<br>
steering matrices are typically unitary matrices having columns that are orthogonal to<br>
one another. The steering matrices may also be orthonormal matrices having<br>
orthogonal columns and unit power for each column, so that V" -V = 1, and I is the<br>
identity matrix. A steering matrix of a dimension that is not square may be obtained by<br>
deleting one or more columns of a square steering matrix.<br>
[0094] Different steering matrices may be used for different time intervals. For<br>
example, different steering matrices may be used for different symbol periods for SFTD<br>
and for different 2-symbol intervals for STTD and OTD. For an OFDM system,<br>
different steering matrices may be used for different subbands for STTD and OTD and<br>
for different pairs of subbands for SFTD. Different steering matrices may also be used<br>
for different subbands and different symbol periods. The randomization provided by<br>
spatial spreading (across time and/or frequency) with the use of different steering<br>
matrices can mitigate deleterious effects of a wireless chael.<br>
 [0095] FIG. 7 shows an exemplary protocol data unit (PDU) 700 that supports MISO<br>
and MEMO transmissions. PDU 700 includes a section 710 for a MIMO pilot and a<br>
section 720 for data. PDU 700 may also include other sections, e.g., for a preamble,<br>
signaling, and so on. A MIMO pilot is a pilot that is sent from all transmit anteas<br>
used for data transmission and allows a receiving entity to estimate the MISO or MIMO<br>
chael used for data transmission. The MEMO pilot may be transmitted in various<br>
maers.<br>
[0096] In an embodiment, the transmitting entity transmits a "clear" MEMO pilot (i.e.,<br>
without spatial spreading) from all NT transmit anteas, as follows:<br>
I'(,0 = W(0-P() , for  = 1 ... L, Eq(41)<br>
where p(fc) is an NT xl vector with NT pilot symbols sent on subband k;<br>
W(0 is an NT x NT diagonal Walsh matrix for symbol period t; and<br>
x/0,(M) is an NT xl vector with NT spatially processed symbols for the clear<br>
MEMO pilot for subband k in symbol period t.<br>
The NT transmit anteas may be assigned NT different Walsh sequences of length L,<br>
where L  NT. Each Walsh sequence corresponds to one diagonal element of W(0.<br>
Alternatively, the transmitting entity may generate the clear MEMO pilot as:<br>
luot(fci0 = w(0 - p(fc)  where p(k) is a scalar for a pilot symbol, and w(0 is an<br>
NTxl vector with the Walsh sequences assigned to the NT transmit anteas. For<br>
simplicity, the continuous beamforming is not shown in equation (41) but is typically<br>
performed in the same maer, if at all, for both pilot and data transmission. The<br>
MEMO chael is assumed to be constant over the length of the Walsh sequences.<br>
[0097] The received pilot symbols obtained by the receiving entity for the clear MEMO<br>
pilot may be expressed as:<br>
r;,D, (,0 = H(fc) • W(0' P(fc) + n() , for t = 1 ... L, Eq (42)<br>
where rj(/or(.0 is an NRxl vector with NR received pilot symbols for the clear<br>
MEMO pilot for subband k in symbol period t.<br>
31<br>
[0098] The receiving entity may derive an estimate of the MEMO chael matrix H(<br>
based on the clear MEMO pilot. Each column of H(&amp;) is associated with a respective<br>
Walsh sequence. The receiving entity may obtain an estimate of A; ,•(&amp;), which is the<br>
chael gain between the i-th transmit antea and thej-th receive antea, as follows.<br>
The receiving entity first multiplies thej-th element of r™te(£,l) through r"/0/(£,L) by<br>
the L chips of Walsh sequence W; assigned to the z'-th transmit antea and obtains a<br>
sequence of L recovered symbols. The receiving entity then removes the modulation<br>
used for pilot symbol p,(fc), which is the z'-th element of p(fc), from the L recovered<br>
symbols. The receiving entity then accumulates the L resultant symbols to obtain the<br>
estimate of h} t ( k ) , which is the element in thej-th row and the z'-th column of H(fc).<br>
The process is repeated for each of the elements of H(&amp;). The receiver entity may then<br>
derive an estimate of H (k) based on H(A:) and the known steering matrices used by<br>
the transmitting entity. The receiving entity may use Iteff(k) for receiver spatial<br>
processing, as described above.<br>
[0099] The transmitting entity may send a spatially spread MEMO pilot, as follows:<br>
where p(&amp;) is an Nc xl vector with NC pilot symbols to be sent on subband k;<br>
W(f) is an Nc xNc diagonal Walsh matrix for symbol period /;<br>
V(£) is an NT x Nc steering matrix for spatial spreading for subband k; and<br>
ptlot(k,f) is an NTxl vector with NT spatially processed symbols for the<br>
spatially spread MIMO pilot for subband k in symbol period t.<br>
The Walsh sequences have length of L, where L  Nc for the spatially spread MEMO<br>
pilot. Alternatively, the transmitting entity may generate the spatially spread MIMO<br>
pilot as: x",,Dt (£,') = YCO'YlM'.?(&amp;) where p(k) and w(f) are described above.<br>
[00100] The received pilot symbols obtained by the receiving entity for the spatially<br>
spread MEMO pilot may be expressed as:<br>
Eq(44)<br>
32<br>
where r"/to(fc,f) is an NR xl vector with NR received pilot symbols for the spatially<br>
spread M3MO pilot for subband k in symbol period t.<br>
[00101] The receiving entity may derive an estimate of the effective MIMO chael<br>
Hejr(fc) based on the received pilot symbols in r"fte(fc,0, e.g., as described above for<br>
the clear MIMO pilot. In this case, the receiving entity removes p(&amp;) and W(f) and<br>
obtains A(&amp;), which is an estimate of H(fc)- V(fc). Alternatively, the transmitting<br>
entity may generate a spatially spread MIMO pilot as: x"ilot(k,t) = W(0'P(£) or<br>
x"flof(fc,0 = w(0-,p(fc), where W(0 or w(f) performs the spatial spreading. In this<br>
case, the receiving entity may form H,(fc), which is an estimate of H(fc) • _W(fc),<br>
directly based on the received pilot symbols without any extra processing. In any case,<br>
the receiving entity may use Keff(k) for receiver spatial processing.<br>
[00102] In another embodiment, the transmitting entity transmits a clear or spatially<br>
spread MIMO pilot using subband multiplexing. With subband multiplexing, only one<br>
transmit antea is used for each subband in each symbol period. The Walsh matrix<br>
W(/) is not needed.<br>
