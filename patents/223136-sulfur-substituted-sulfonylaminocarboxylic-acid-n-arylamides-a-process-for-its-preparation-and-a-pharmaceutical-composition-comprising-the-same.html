Sulfur substituted sulfonylaminocarboxylic acid N-arylamides, their preparation, their use and pharmaceutical preparations comprising them<br><br>
pharmaceutically active compounds for the therapy and prophylaxis of diseases, for example of cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension, angina pectoris, cardiac insufficiency, thromboses or atherosclerosis. The compounds of the formula I are capable of modulating the body's production of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) and are generally suitable for the therapy and prophylaxis of diseases which are associated with a disturbed cGMP balance. The invention furthermore relates to processes for preparing compounds of the formula I, to their use for the therapy and prophylaxis of the abovementioned diseases and for preparing pharmaceuticals for this purpose, and to pharmaceutical preparations which comprise compounds of the formula I.<br><br>
cGMP is an important intracellular messenger which triggers a multitude of different effects via the modulation of cGMP-dependent protein kinases, phosphodiesterases and ion channels. Examples are the relaxation of smooth muscles, the inhibition of thrombocyte activation and the inhibition of the proliferation of smooth-muscle cells and of leukocyte adhesion, cGMP is produced by particulate and soluble guanylate cyclases as a response to a number of extracellular and intracellular stimuli. In the case of the particulate guanylate cyclases, stimulation is essentially effected by peptidic messengers, such as the atrial natriuretic peptide or the cerebral natriuretic peptide. The soluble guanylate cyclases (sGC), which are cytosolic heterodimeric heme proteins, in contrast, are essentially regulated by a family of low-molecular-weight factors which are formed enzymatically. The most important stimulant is nitrogen monoxide (NO) or a closely related species. The function of other factors such as carbon monoxide or the hydroxyl radical is still largely unclear. Binding of NO to the heme with formation of a penta-coordinate heme-nitrosyl complex is being discussed as activation mechanism of the activation by NO. The associated release of the histidine which is bound in the basal state to the iron converts the enzyme into the active conformation.<br>
Active soluble guanylate cyclases are composed of an a and a p subunit each. Several subunit subtypes have been described which differ from one another with respect to sequence, tissue-specific distribution and expression in different development stages. The subtypes ai and I3i are mainly expressed in brain and lung, while P2 is found in particular in liver and kidney. The subtype a2 was shown to be present in human fetal brain. The subunits referred to as as and p3 were isolated from human brain and are homologous to ai and 3i. More recent works indicate an a21 subunit which contains an insert in the catalytic domain. All subunits show great homologies in the region of the catalytic domain. The enzymes presumably contain one heme per heterodimer, which is bound via P1-Cys-78 and/or Pi-His-105 and is part of the regulatory center.<br><br>
Under pathologic conditions, the formation of guanylate-cyclase-activating factors can be reduced, or their degradation may be promoted owing to the increased occurrence of free radicals. The resulting reduced activation of the sGC leads, via a weakening of the respective cGMP-mediated cellular response, for example to an increase of the blood pressure, to platelet activation or to increased cell proliferation and cell adhesion. As a consequence, formation of endothelial dysfunction, atherosclerosis, hypertension, stable or unstable angina pectoris, thromboses, myocardial infarction, strokes or erectile dysfunction results. Pharmacological stimulation of sGG.offers a possibility to normalize cGMP production and therefore makes possible the treatment and/or prevention of such disorders.<br>
For the pharmacological stimulation of the sGC, use has hitherto almost exclusively been made, of compounds whose activity is based on an intermediate NO release, for example organic nitrates. The drawback of this treatment is the development of tolerance and a reduction of activity, and the higher dosage which is required because of this.<br>
Various sGC stimulators which do not act via NO release were described by Vesely in a series of publications. However, the compounds, most of which are hormones, plant hormones, vitamins or natural compounds such as, for example, lizard poisons predominantly only have weak effects on the cGMP formation in cell lysates (D. L. Vesely, Eur. J. Clin. Invest. 15 (1985)258; D. L. Vesely,-Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 88 (1979) 1244). A stimulation of heme-free guanylate cyclase by protoporphyrin IX was demonstrated by Ignarro et al. (Adv. Pharmacol, 26 (1994) 35). Pettibone et al. (Eur. J. Pharmacol. 116 (1985) 307) described an antihypertensive action of diphenyliodonium hexafluorophosphate and attributed this to a stimulation of sGC. According to Yu et al. (Brit. J. Pharmacol. 114 (1995) 1587), isoliquiritigenin, which has a relaxing action on isolated rat aortas, also activates sGC. Ko et al. (Blood 84 (1994) 4226), Yu et al. (Biochem. J. 306 (1995) 787) and Wu et al. (Brit. J. Pharmacol. 116 (1995) 1973) demonstrated a sGC-stimulating activity of 1-benzyl-3-(5-hydroxymethyl-2-furyl)indazole and demonstrated an<br><br>
antiproliferative and thrombocyte-inhibiting action. Pyrazoies and fused pyrazoles which exhibit a sGC-stimulating activity are described in EP-A-908456 and DE-A-19744027<br>
A series of 2-sulfonylaminoben2oic acid N-arylamides the N-aryl group of which carries a thio substituent have been mentioned in the literature. These compounds in which the N-aryl group generally carries as further substituents groups which are readily oxidizable such as, for example, two hydroxy groups being in para position with respect to one another and which in this case can be regarded as hydroquinone derivatives, are auxiliaries for the preparation of photographic materials (see, for example, Chemical Abstracts 119,105757; 120, 41858; 123, 70224 or 126, 257007). If isolated structural elements are considered then the N-aryl group in these known compounds corresponds to the group R-S(0)n-A in formula I in case A denotes a 1,4-phenylene residue which in positions 2 and 5 carries hydroxy groups (or oxy substituents), and the number n is 0. British patent publication 876526 (Chemical Abstracts 56,15432e) discloses 3,5-dichioro-2-methylsulfonyiaminoben2oic acid N-(5-chloro-2-(4-chlorophenylmercapto)-phenyl)-amide which can be used for the protection of wool against moths. Compounds covered by GB-A-876526 correspond to compounds of the formula i if simultaneously the ring A which comprises the carbon atoms which carry the groups C(=X)-NH- and NH-SOR together with the residues R, is a benzene ring which carries one to four halogen atoms from the series chlorine and bromine, R is (C1-C4)-alkyl, X is oxygen and the group R'-S(0)n-A- is a phenylmercaptophenyl- residue (= phenylthiophenyl-) wtiich is substituted by halogen and/or trifluoromethyl and which can also be substituted by methyl or (C1-C4)-alkoxy, and the total number of halogen atoms and trifluoromethyl groups is greater than two. Pharmacological activities of these known 2-sulfonylaminobenzoic acid N-arylamides are not disclosed.<br>

Alkyi residues can be straight-chain or branched. This also applies when they are part of other groups, for example in alkoxy groups, alkoxycarbonyl groups or amino groups, or when they are substituted. Examples of alky! groups are methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl, hexyl, heptyl, octyl, nonyl, decyl, undecyl, dodecyl, tridecyl, tetradecyl, pentadecyl, hexadecyl, heptadecyl, octadecyl, the n-isomers of these residues, isopropyl, isobutyl, isopentyl, sec-butyl, tert-butyl, neopentyl, 3,3-dimethylbutyl. The term alkyl here also expressly includes unsaturated atkyl residues, i. e. alkyl residues which contain one or more double bonds and/or one or more triple bonds such as, for example, alkenyl residues and alkinyl residues. Of course, an unsaturated alkyl group contains at least two carbon atoms. Specific alkyl groups whose number of carbon atoms can vary from 1 to a given upper limit, thus also comprise unsaturated alkyl groups whose number of carbon atoms can vary from 2 to the given upper limit. Examples of such residues are the vinyl residue, the 1-propenyl residue, the 2-propenyl residue (allyl residue), the 2-butenyl residue, the 2-methyl-2-propenyl residue, the 3-methyl-2-butenyl residue, the ethinyl residue, the 2-propinyl residue (propargyl residue), the 2-butinyl residue or the 3-butinyl residue. Further, the term alkyl here also expressly includes alkyl residues in which by an internal ring closure within the alkyl group a cyclic system is formed, i. e. the term alkyl also includes saturated and partially unsaturated cycloalkyi residues and cycloalkyl-aikyi- residues (alkyl substituted by cycloalkyi). Of course, a monocyclic cycloalkyi group contains at least three carbon atoms. Specific alkyl groups whose number of carbon atoms can vary from 1 to a given upper limit, thus also comprise monocyclic cycloalkyi groups whose number of carbon atoms can vary from 3 to the given upper limit, and appropriate cycloalkyl-alkyi- groups. Examples of such cycloalkyi residues are cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cydopentyl, cyclohexyl, cycloheptyl and cyclooctyl which can all also be substituted by one or more identical or different (C1-C4)-alkyl residues, in particular by methyl. Examples of such substituted cycloalkyi residues are 4-methylcyclohexyl, 4-tert-butylcyctohexyl or 2,3-dimethylcyclopentyl. Furthermore, unless stated otherwise the term alkyl here also expressly includes unsubstituted alkyl residues as well as alkyl residues which are<br><br>
substituted by one or more, for example one, two, three or four, identical or different aryl residues. The term atkyi thus here also expressly includes arylalkyi- residues such as, for example, aryl-(C1-C4)-alkyi-, for example benzyl residues, phenylethyt residues or Indanyl residues. In substituted alkyl residues, for example arylalkyi-, hydroxyaikyi- such as -(C1-Cjj-alkyl-OH or alkoxyalkyl- such as -(C1-C3)-alkyl-0-(C1-C4)-alkyl, the substituents can be present in any desired position.<br>
A saturated or partially unsaturated 3-membered to 7-membered carbocycie representing the ring A can be derived from the monocyclic parent systems cyclopropane, cyclobutane, cyciopentane, cyclohexane or cycloheptane. If the carbocycie is unsaturated it can contain, for example, one double bond or, in th6 case of a 5-membered ring, 6-membered ring or 7-membered ring, also two double bonds which can be isolated or conjugated. Double bonds can be present in any positions with respect to the groups C(=X)-NH- and NH-S02-R, i. e., for example a double bond can also be present between the two ring carbon atoms which carry these two groups.<br>
Unless stated othen/vise, phenyl residues, naphthyl residues and heterocyclic residues, for example heteroaryl residues, can be unsubstituted or can carry one or more, for example one, two, three or four, identical or different substituents which can be in anv desired positions. Unless stated otherwise, in these residues for example those substituents can be present which are indicated as substituents of an aryl group. A preferred series of substituents that can be present in the residue aryl is formed by the substituents halogen, (C1-C5)-alkyl, phenyl, tolyl, CF3, NO2, OH, -0-(C1-Cs}-alkyl, -0-(C2-C4)-alkyl-0-(C1-C3)-alkyl, (CrC2)-alkylenedioxy, NH2, -NH-{C1-C3)-alkyl, -N((C1-C3)-alkyi)2, -NH-CHO, -NH-C0-(C1-C5)-alky!, -CN. -CO-NH2, -C0-NH-(C1-C3)-alkyl, -CO-N((CrC3)-alkyl)2, -CO-OH, -CO-0-(C1-Cs)-alkyl, heterocyclyl, CHO, -CO-{C,-Cs)-alkyl, -S(0)„-(C1-C4)-alkyl, -S(0)n-phenyl and -S(0)„-toiyl. if in compounds of the formula I nitro groups are present as substituents, in total only up to two nitro groups can be present in the molecules. If phenyl residues, phenoxy residues, benzyl residues or benzyloxy residues are present as<br><br>
substituents in, for example, aryl residues like phenyl residues and/or in heterocyclic residues then in these substituents the benzene ring can also be unsubstituted or substituted by one or more, for example one, two, three or four, identical or different residues, for example by residues from the series (C1-C4)-alkyl, halogen, hydroxy, (C1-C4)-alkoxy, trifiuoromethyl, cyano, hydroxycarbonyl, ((C1-C4)-alkoxy-)carbonyl, aminocarbonyl, nitro, amino, (C1-C4)-alkylamino, di-((C1-C4)-alkyl)amino and ((C1-C4)-alkyl)carbonyIaminQ.<br>
In monosubstituted phenyl residues the substituent can be in the 2-position, the 3-position or the 4-position, in disubstituted phenyl residues the substituents can be in 2,3-position, 2,4-position, 2,5-position, 2,6-position, 3,4-position or 3,5-position. In trisubstituted phenyl residues the substituents can be in 2,3,4-position, 2,3.5-position, 2,3,6-positi6n, 2,4,5-position, 2,4,6-posit)on or 3,4,5-position. ToiyI (= methylphenyl) can be 2-tolyl, 3-tolyl or 4-tolyl. Naphthyl can be 1-naphthyl or 2-naphthy!. In monosubstituted 1-naphthyl residues the substituent can be in the 2-position, the 3-position, the 4-position, the 5-position, the 6-position, the 7-position or the 8-position, in monosubstituted 2-naphthyl residues in the 1-position, the 3-position, the 4-position, the 5-position, the 6-position, the 7-posltion or the 8-position.<br>
The above explanations as well as the following explanations relating to monovalent residues correspondingly apply to the divalent residues phenylene, naphthylene and heteroarylene. The free bonds via which the divalent residues are attached to the adjacent groups can be present on any ring carbon atoms. In the case of a phenylene residue they can be in 1,2-position (ortho-phenylene), 1,3-position.{meta-phenylene) or 1,4-position (para-phenyiene). In the case of a naphthylene residue the free bonds can be in 1,2-position (= 1,2-naphthylene or 1,2-naphthalinediyl) or in 1,3-position, 1,4-position, 1,5-position, 1,6-position, 1,7-position, 1,8-position, 2,3-positioh, 2,6-position or 2,7-position. In the case of 5-membered ring aromatics containing one heteroatom such as, for example, thiophene or furan, the two free bonds can be in 2,3-position, 2,4-position, 2,5-position or 3,4-position. A divalent<br><br>
residue derived from pyridine can be a 2,3-, 2,4-, 2,5-, 2,6-, 3,4- or 3,5-pyridin6diyl residue. In tine case of unsymmetrical divalent residues the present invention includes all positional isomers, i. e., in the case of a 2,3-pyridinediyl residue, for example, it includes the compound in which the one adjacent group is present in the 2-position and the other adjacent group is present in the 3-position as well as the compound in which the one adjacent group is present in the 3-position and the other adjacent group is present in the 2-position.<br>
Heteroaryt residues, heteroarylene residues, heterocyclyl residues, heterocycles representing the ring A and rings which are formed by two groups bonded to a nitrogen atom together with this nitrogen atom are preferably derived from heterocycles which contain one, two, three or four identical or different ring heteroatoms, more preferably from heterocycles which contain one, two or three, in particular one or two, identical or different heteroatoms. Unless stated otherwise, the heterocycles can be monocyclic or polycyclic, for example monocyclic, bicyclic or tricyclic. Preferably they are monocyclic or bicyclic. The rings preferably are 5-membered rings, 6-membered ring or T-membered ring. Examples of monocyclic and bicyclic heterocyclic systems from which residues occuring in the compounds of the formula I can be derived, are pyrrole, furan, thiophene, imidazole, pyrazote, 1,2,3-triazole, 1,2,4-triazole, 1,3-dioxole, 1,3-oxazole (= oxazole), 1,2-oxazole (= isoxazole), 1,3-thiazole { thiazole), 1,2-thiazol6 (= isothiazole), tetrazole, pyridine, pyridazine, pyriraidine, pyrazine, pyran, thiopyran, 1,4-dioxine, 1,2-oxazine, 1,3-oxazine, 1,4-oxazin6,1,2-thiazinie, 1,3-thiazine, 1,4-thiazine, 1,2,3-triazine, 1,2,4-triazine, 1,3,5-triazine, 1,2,4,5-tetrazine, azepine, 1,2-diazepine, 1,3-diazepine, 1,4-diazepine, 1,3-oxazepine, 1,3-thiazepine, indole, benzothiophene, benzofuran, benzothiazole, benzimidazole, quinoline, isoquinoline, cinnoline, quinazoline, quinoxaline, phthalazine, thienothiophenes, 1,8-naphthyridine and other naphthyridines, pteridin, or phenothiazine, each of them in saturated form (perhydro form) or in partially unsaturated form (for example in the dihydro form or the tetrahydro form) or in maximally unsaturated form, insofar as the respective forms are known and stable. Thus, the heterocycles which are suitable also include, for<br><br>
example, the saturated heterocycles pyrrolidine, piperidine, piperazine, morphoiine and thiomorpholine. The degree of saturation of heterocyclic groups is indicated in their individual definitions. Unsaturated heterocycles can contain, for example, one, two or three double bonds within the ring system. 5-membered rings and 6-membered rings can in particular also be aromatic.<br>
The residues derived from these heterocycles can be attached via any suitable carbon atom. Nitrogen heterocycles which can carry a hydrogen atom or a substituent on a ring nitrogen atom, for example pyrrole, imidazole, pyrrolidine, morphoiine, piperazine etc., can also be attached via a ring nitrogen atom, in particular if the heterocyclic residue in question is bonded to a carbon atom. For example, a thienyl residue can be present as 2-thienyl residue or 3-thienyl residue, a furyl residue as 2-furyl residue or 3-furyl residue, a pyridyl residue as 2-pyridyl residue, 3-pyridyl residue or 4-pyridy! residue, a piperidiny! residue as 1-piperidiny! residue (= piperidino residue), 2-piperidinyl residue, 3-piperidinyl residue or 4-piperidinyl residue, a (thio)morpholinyl residue as 2-(thio)morpholinyl residue, 3-(th(o)morpholinyl residue or 4-(thio)morpholinyl residue (= thiomorpholino residue), A residue derived from 1,3-thiazole or imidazole which is attached via a carbon atom can be attached via the 2-position, the 4-position or the 5-position.-<br>
Unless stated otherwise the heterocyclic groups can be unsubstituted or can carry one or more, for example one, two three or four, identical or different substituents. Substituents in heterocycles can be present in any desired positions, for example in a 2-thienyl residue or 2-furyl residue in the 3-position and/or in the 4-position and/or n the 5-position, in a 3-thienyl residue or 3-furyl residue in the 2-position and/or in he 4-position and/or in the 5-position, in a 2-pyridyl residue in the 3-position and/or n the 4-position and/or in the 5-position and/or in the 6-position, in a 3-pyridyi residue in the 2-position and/or in the 4-position and/or in the 5-position and/or in the 6-position, in a 4-pyridyl residue in the 2-position and/or in the 3-position and/or in the 5-position and/or in the 6-position. Unless stated othenvise, for example those substituents can be present as substituents in heterocyclic groups which are<br><br>
indicated in the definition of the group aryl, and in the case of saturated and partially unsaturated heterocycles as further substituents also the oxo group and the thioxo group can be present. Substituents on a heterocycle as well as substituents on a carbocycle can also form a ring, i. e. to a ring system further rings can be condensed (or anellated) so that, for example, also cyclopenta-condensed, cyclohexa-condensed or benzo-condensed rings can be present. Suitable substituents on a substitutable ring nitrogen atom of a heterocycle are in particular, for example, unsubstituted (C1-Cs)-alkyl residues and aryl-substituted alkyl residues, aryl residues, acyl residues such as -C0-(C1-C5)-alkyi. or sulfonyl residues such as -SO2-(C1-C5)-alkyt. Suitable nitrogen heterocycles can also be present as N-oxides or as quarternary salts containing a counterion which is derived from a physiologically acceptable acid. Pyridyl residues, for example, can be present as pyridine-N-oxides.<br>

The presents invention also relates to processesfor the preparation of the compounds of the formula I which are described in the following and by which the compounds of the invention are obtainable. According to Scheme 1 compounds of the invention can be obtained, for example, by first reacting an aminocarboxylic acid of the formula II with a sulfonyl chloride of the formula R-SOa-CI or a sulfonic acid anhydride in the presence of a base in a solvent like water, pyridine or an ether. Suitable bases are inorganic bases like sodium carbonate or organic bases like, for example, pyridine or triethylamine. The sulfonylaminocarboxylic acid of the formula III that is obtained can then be activated, for example by reaction with a chlorinating<br><br>
agent like phosphorus pentachloride, phosphorus oxychloride or thionyl chloride in an inert solvent, to give an acid chloride of the formula IV which is then reacted with an arylamine. The activation of the carboxylic acid group in the compounds of the formula III can, however, also be carried our in a different manner, for example by one of the numerous methods for the formation of amide bonds in peptide chemistry which are well-known to the skilled person, for example by conversion into a mixed anhydride or an activated ester or by using a carbodiimide like dicyclohexylcarbodimide.<br>
The reaction of the activated sulfonylaminocarboxylic acid with an arylarhine is favorably carried out in an inert solvent such as, for example, pyridine, tetrahydrofuran or toluene in the absence or in the presence of an inert auxiliary base like, for example, a tertiary amine or pyridine. If the arylamine that is employed in the reaction with the activated carboxylic acid already contains the desired substituent R-S(0)„ then the reaction directly provides the final compound of the formula I. Compounds of the formula I in which the number n in the group R-S(0)n is 1 or 2 can also be obtained by reacting an activated carboxylic acid with a mercapto substituted arylamine of the formula R-S-A-NHj and then oxidizing the mercapto group in the compound of the formula V under standard conditions, for example with a peroxide like hydrogen peroxide or a peracid like S-chloroperbenzoic acid or monoperoxyphthalic acid in a solvent like, for example, methylene chloride or acetone. The activated carboxylic acids can also first be reacted with arylamines of the formula A-NHa, The resulting reaction product of the formula VI can then be chlorosulfonated under standard conditions and the chlorosulfonyi group can then be converted under standard conditions into the group R-SOz, for example by reaction with suitable amines in substance or in a solvent like N-methylpyrrolidone, dimethylformamide, toluene or an ether, optionally in the presence of an auxiliary base, in a similar manner the activated carboxylic acids can be reacted with<br><br><br><br>
fluorosulfonylarylamines of the formula F-S02-A-NH2 and the fluorosulfonyl intermediates of the formula V!l that are obtained can be converted under standard conditions into the compounds of the formula I according to the invention.<br>
The compounds of the formula I according to the invention can furthermore be obtained by reacting the activated sulfonylaminocarboxylic acids, for example the acid chlorides of the formula IV shown in Scheme 1, with a mercaptoaryiamine of the formula HaN-A-SH which is unsubstituted on the sulfur atom. In a nudeophllic substitution reaction the product of the formula VIII that is obtained can subsequently be alkylated or arytated on the sulfur atom with an alkyl halogenide or an aryl halogenide or another reactive compound under standard conditions and, if desired, be oxidized on the sulfur to give the sulfoxide or the sulfone as explained above with respect to the compounds of the formula V (see Scheme 2).<br><br>
Compounds of the formula I can also be obtained, for example, by first activating a suitably substituted nitrocarboxylic acid of the formula IX, for example by converting it into the respective acid chloride of the formula X or by another procedure, and then reacting it with a substituted arylamine of the formula R-S(0)n-A-NH2<br><br><br><br>
analogously to the procedures described above (see Scheme 3). Here, too, as arylamines fluorosuifonylarylamines of the formula F-SOj-A-NHz can be employed, and in the N-(fIuorosu!fonylaryl)-carboxamides of the formula XI that are obtained the fluorosulfonyl group can be converted under standard conditions into a group R-S02 according to the invention, for example with an amine of the formula HNRR.<br>
Before subsequently in the nitro intermediates of the formula XII that are obtained the nitro group is reduced to an amino group use can be made of the activating effect of the nitro group onto the ring A and a suitable residue R, for example a halogen atom, can be replaced with a different residue R by reaction with a nucleophil, for example an amine. The reduction of the nitro group to give an amino group can, for example, be carried out by catalytic hydrogenation in the presence of a noble metal catalyst or, preferably, in the presence of Raney nickel in a solvent like ethanol, glacial acetic acid or a ethanolic solution of hydrogen chloride, or it can be carried out by reduction with a base metal like zinc, tin or iron in the presence of an acid. The reduction can also be carried out, for example, with tin(ll) chloride or by reaction with sodium dithionite, favorably in a mixture of methanol, tetrahydrofuran and water as solvent. The sulfonylation of the amino group in the reduction product of the formula Xill with an activated sulfonic acid derivative can be carried out analogously to the reactions described above, for example with a sulfonic acid chloride in pyridine, and finally gives the compound of the formula I.<br>
The compounds of the formula I in which X is a nitrogen atom which via a single bond is attached to a ring carbon atom in the group A which ring carbon atom is directly adjacent to the carbon atom in A carrying the group -NH-C(=X)-, i. e. the benzimidazole derivatives of the formula li, can for example be obtained by reacting an activated sulfonylaminocarboxylic acid derivative obtained as described above according to Scheme 1, for example a carboxylic acid chloride of the formula IV, (or also, in analogy to Scheme 3, a nitrocarlsoxylic acid derivative) with a 1,2-diaminoarene in the presence of a dehydrating agent such as, for example, thionyl<br><br><br>
diioride or phosphorus pentachloride (see Scheme 4). The reaction is usually carried out in an inert solvent, for example in a hydrocarbon like toluene or xylene. The 1,2-diaminoarene can already contain the final group R'-S(0)n or a precursor group thereof, for example the group R-S. Subsequent steps, for example reactions on the sulfur atom, can then be carried out as explained above. Just so, unsubstituted 1,2-diaminoarenes can be employed and the resulting products of the formula XIV can be chiorosuifonated, for example with chlorosulfuric acid, and the sulfonyl chlorides that are obtained can be converted into the final compounds containing the group R-SOa, for example by reaction with a suitable amine.<br>
All reactions for the synthesis of the compounds of the formula I are per se well-known to the skilled person and can be carried out under standard conditions according to or analogously to procedures described in the literature, for example in<br><br>
Houben-Weyl, Methoden der Organischen Chemie (Methods of Organic Chemistry), Thieme-Verlag, Stuttgart, or Organic Reactions, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York. Depending on the circumstances of the individual case, in order to avoid side reactions during the synthesis of a compound of the formula I it can be necessary or advantageous to temporarily block functional groups by introducing protective groups and to deprotect them in a later stage of the synthesis, or introduce functional groups in the form of precursor groups which in a later reaction step are converted into the desired functional groups. Such synthetic strategies and protective groups and precursor groups which are suitable in an individual case are known to the skilled person, If desired the compounds of the formula I can be purified by customary purification procedures, for example by recrystallization or chromatography. The starting compounds for the preparation of the compounds of the formula I are commercially available or can be prepared according to or analogously to literature procedures.<br>
The compounds of the formula I according to the invention effect an increase of the cGMP concentration via the activation of the soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC), and they are therefore useful agents for the therapy and prophylaxis of disorders which are associated with a low or decreased cGMP level or which are caused thereby, or for whose therapy or prophylaxis an increase of the present cGMP level is desired. The activation of the sGC by the compounds of the formula I can be examined, for example, in the activity assay described below.<br>
Disorders and pathological conditions which are associated with a low cGMP level or in which an increase of the cGMP level is desired and for whose therapy and prophylaxis it is possible to use compounds of the formula I are, for example, cardiovascular diseases, such as endothelial dysfunction, diastolic dysfunction, atherosclerosis, hypertension, stable and unstable angina pectoris, thromboses, restenoses, myocardial infarction, strokes, cardiac insufficiency or pulmonary hypertonia, or, for example, erectile dysfunction, asthma bronchiale, chronic kidney insufficiency and diabetes. Compounds of the formula I can additionally be used in<br><br>
the therapy of cirrhosis of the liver and also for improving a restricted memory performance or ability to learn.<br>
The compounds of the formula I and their physiologically acceptable salts can be administered to animals, preferably to mammals, and in particular to humans, as pharmaceuticals by themselves, in mixtures with one another or in the form of pharmaceutical preparations. A subject of the present invention therefore also are the compounds of the formula I and their physiologically acceptable salts for use as pharmaceuticals, their use for activating soluble guanylate cyclase, for normalizing a disturbed cGMP balance and in particular their use in the therapy and prophylaxis of the abovementioned syndromes as well as their use for preparing medicaments for these purposes. Furthermore, a subject of the present invention are pharmaceutical preparations (or pharmaceutical compositions) which comprise as active component an effective dose of at least one compound of the formula I and/or a physiologically acceptable salt thereof and a customary pharmaceutically acceptable cairier, i. e. one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carrier substances and/or additives. A subject of the present invention are also those compounds of the formula I which were already known per se and which are excluded by disclaimer from the above-defined compounds of the formula I which are per se a subject of the present invention, and their physiologically acceptable salt as activators of soluble guanylate cyclase. All statements above and below relating to the pharmacological effects and the uses of the compounds of the formula I thus also apply to the compound of the formula I wherein simultaneously the ring A which comprises the carbon atoms which carry the groups C(=X)-NH- and NH-SOjR is a benzene ring which is substituted in positions 3 and 5 by chlorine, R is methyl, X is oxygen and RVS{0)n-A'- is a 5-chloro-2-(4-chlorophenyimercapto)-phenyl residue, and its physiologically acceptable salts. Thus, a subject of the invention are, for example, said compound and its physiologically acceptable salts for use as a pharmaceutical, pharmaceutical preparations which comprise as active component an effective dose of said compound and/or a physiologically acceptable salt thereof and a customary pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, and the uses of said compound and/or a<br><br>
physiologically acceptable salt thereof in the therapy or prophylaxis of the abovementioned syndromes as well as their use for preparing medicaments for these purposes.<br>
The pharmaceuticals according to the invention can be administered orally, for example in the form of pills, tablets, lacquered tablets, sugar-coated tablets, granules, hard and soft gelatin capsules, aqueous, alcoholic or oily solutions, syrups, emulsions or suspensions, or rectally, for example in the form of suppositories. Administration can also be carried out parenteraliy, for example subcutaneously, intramuscularly or intravenously in the form of solutions for injection or infusion. Other suitable administration forms are, for example, percutaneous or topical administration, for example in the form of ointments, tinctures, sprays or transdermal therapeutic systems, or the inhalative administration in the form of nasal sprays or aerosol mixtures, or, for example, microcapsules, implants or rods. The preferred administration form depends, for example, on the disease to be treated and on its severity.<br>
The amount of active compound of the formula I and/or its physiologically acceptable salts in the pharmaceutical preparations normally is from 0.2 to 500 mg, preferably from1 to 200 mg, per dose, but depending on the type of the pharmaceutical preparation it can also be higher. The pharmaceutical preparations usually comprise 0.6 to 90 percent by weight of the compounds of the formula I and/or their physiologically acceptable salts. The preparation of the pharmaceutical preparations can be carried out in a manner known per se. For this purpose, one or more compounds of the formula I and/or their physiologically acceptable salts, together with one or more solid or liquid pharmaceutical carrier substances and/or additives (or auxiliary substances) and, if desired, in combination with other pharmaceutically active compounds having therapeutic or prophylactic action, are brought into a suitable administration form or dosage form which can then be used as a pharmaceutical in human or veterinary medicine.<br><br>
For the production of pilis, tablets, sugar-coated tablets and hard gelatin capsules It is possible to use, for example, lactose, starch, for example maize starch, or starch derivatives, talc, stearic acid or its salts, etc. Carriers for soft gelatin capsules and suppositories are, for example, fats, waxes, semisolid and liquid poiyols, natural or hardened oils, etc. Suitable carriers for the preparation of solutions, for example of solutions for injection, or of emulsions or syrups are, for example, water, physiologically sodium chloride solution, alcohols such as ethanol, glycerol, poiyols, sucrose, invert sugar, glucose, mannitol, vegetable oils, etc. It is also possible to lyophilize the compounds of the formula I and their physiologically acceptable salts and to use the resulting lyophilisates, for example, for preparing preparations for injection or infusion. Suitable carriers for microcapsules, implants or rods.are, for example, copolymers of glycolic acid and lactic acid.<br>
Besides the active compounds and carriers, the pharmaceutical preparations can also contain customary additives, for example fillers, disintegrants, binders, lubricants, wetting agents, stabilizers, emulsifiers, dispersants, preservatives, sweeteners, colorants, flavorings, aromatizers, thickeners, diluents, buffer substances, solvents, soiubilizers, agents for achieving a depot effect, salts for altering the osmotic pressure, coating agents or antioxidants.<br>
The dosage of the active compound of the formula I to be administered and/or of a physiologically acceptable salt thereof depends on the individual case and is, as is customary, to be adapted to the individual circumstances to achieve an optimum effect. Thus, it depends on \hQ nature and the severity of the disorder to be treated, and also on the sex, age, weight and individual responsiveness of the human or animal to be treated, on the efficacy and duration of action of the compounds used, on whether the therapy is acute or chronic or prophylactic, or on whether other active compounds are administered in addition to compounds of the formula I. In general, a daily dose of approximately 0.01 to 100 mg/kg, preferably 0.1 to 10 mg/kg, in particular 0.3 to 5 mg/kg (in each case mg per kg of bodyweight) is appropriate for administration to an adult weighing approximately 75 kg in order to obtain the<br><br>
desired results. The daily dose can be administered in a single dose or, in particular when larger amounts are administered, be divided into several, for example two, three or four individual doses. In some cases, depending on the individual response, it may be necessary to deviate upwards or downwards from the given.daily dose.<br>
The compounds of the formula I activate the soluble guanylate cyclase, mainly by binding in the heme binding pocket of the enzyme. On account of this property, apart from use as pharmaceutically active compounds in human medicine and veterinary medicine, they can also be employed as a scientific tool or as aids for biochemical investigations in which such an effect on guanylate cyclase Is intended, and also for diagnostic purposes, for example in the in vitro diagnosis of cell samples or tissue samples. The compounds of the formula I and salts thereof can furthermore be employed, as already mentioned above, as intermediates for the preparation of other pharmaceutically active compounds.<br>

Pharmacological investigations<br>
1) Activation of the soluble guanylate cyclase<br>
The activation of the soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) which catalyzes the conversion of guanosine triphosphate (GTP) into cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) and pyrophosphate, by the compounds according to the invention was quantified with the aid of an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) from Amersham. For this purpose the substances to be tested were initially incubated with sGC in microtiter plates, and the amount of the cGMP formed was then determined.<br>
The sGC which was employed had been isolated from bovine lung (see Methods in Enzymology, Volume 195, p. 377). The test solutions (100 li per well) contained 50 mM triethanolamine (TEA) buffer (pH 7.5), 3 mM MgCb, 3 mM reduced glutathione (GSH), 0.1 mM GTP, 1 mM 3-is6butyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX), suitably diluted enzyme solution and the substance to be tested or, in the control experiments, the solvent. The substances to be tested were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and the solution was diluted with DMSO/water, so that the final concentration c of the substance to be tested in the test solution had the value indicated in the table. The DMSO concentration in the test solution was 5 % (v/v). The reaction was initiated by addition of the sGC. The reaction mixture was incubated at 37 *C for 15 to 20 minutes and then stopped by ice-cooling and addition of the stop reagent (50 mM EDTA, pH 8.0). An aliquot of 50 \j\ was taken and used for determining the cGMP content using the acetylation protocol of the Amersham cGMP-EIA kit. The absorption of the samples was measured at 450 nm (reference wavelength 620 nm) in a microtiter plate reader. The cGMP concentration was detemnined using a standard curve which was obtained under the same test conditions. The activation of sGC by a test substance is given as the n-fold stimulation of the basal enzyme activity which was found in the control experiments (using solvent instead of test substance) (calculated using the formula<br><br>
n-foid stimulation = [cGMP]test substance / [cGMPJcontroi   ).<br>

2) Relaxation of rat aorta<br>
For this test, normotensive male Wistar-Kyoto rats were sacrificed by a blow to the neck. The abdominal cavity and the thorax were opened by a medium sternotomy. The descending aorta was subsequently removed, freed of connective tissue and divided into 8 rings of a length of approximately 4 mm. The tip of a pair of tweezers was introduced into the lumen of 4 of the 8 rings. The endothelium was removed by carefully rolling the rings over the tip of the pair of tweezers. All 8 aorta rings (4 with endothelium and 4 without endothelium) were subsequently suspended in an organ bath (Schuler-Organbad; Hugo Sachs Elektronik) at a constant temperature of 37 "C for the isometric determination of the contractile tone. For 30 minutes, the rings were calibrated at a resting tension of 1 g in carbonated (95 % O2; 5 % CO2) Krebs-Henseleit solution (composition: Ha* 144.0 mM; K* 5.9 mM; CI' 126.9 mM; Ca* 1.6 mM; Mg* 1.2 mM; H2PO4" 1.2 mM; SO/* 1.2 mM; HCOg" 25.0 mM; D-glucose 11.1 mM) of pH 7.4. Additionally, 1 pmol/l of indomethacin were added to the Krebs-Henseleit solution to inhibit prostaglandin biosynthesis. The rings were subsequently precontracted by addition of phenylephrine (concentration in the solution: 1 |JM) and the endothelium-dependent relaxation or the functional loss of the endothelium was tested by addition of acetylcholine (concentration in the solution: 1 pM). After a 30-minute washing period, the rings were then again precontracted by addition of phenylephrine (1 pM), and the relaxing action of the test substances of the formula I was determined by administration of cumulative doses of the latter. The data were<br><br>
evaluated by standard methods. Given is the concentration ICw by which contraction is inhibited by 50 % (50 % relaxation).<br>

3) Hemodynamic effect in the pig<br>
Three pigs (German landrace) were anesthetized (Ketamine 20mg/kg l.m., Methomidate 8 mg/kg i.p., Xyla2lne,2.5 mg/kg l.m. and Pentobarbital 25 mg/kg i.v. as a bolus plus 0.16 mg/kg per minute). The trachea was intubated and the animals were given artificial respiration with air. Oxygen was added to keep the blood gas parameters in the normal range. To record the blood pressure (BP; BP(s) = systolic blood pressure, BP(d) = diastolic blood pressure) by means of a Statham 23Db pressure transducer a catheter was inserted into the right A. Femoralis. The left ventricular pressure (LVP), the left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP), the contractility (dP/dt) and the heart rate (HR) were detemnined with a Millar PC 350 catheter "tip manometer" which was inserted into the right ventricle. After a stabilization period of the hemodynamic parameters of 30 minutes the test substance was administered in the indicated dose into the exposed duodenum by means of a catheter The determined data were evaluated according to standard methods.<br><br>
Given are the means and the standard deviations (M ± SEM) of the starting values and of the maximal changes of the individual parameters (= maximal effects).<br>
