in which A, L, Y and k have the meanings indicated below. The compounds of the formula I are valuable pharmacologically active compounds. They exhibit a strong antithrombotic effect and are suitable, for example, for the therapy and prophylaxis of cardiovascular disorders like thromboembolic diseases or restenoses. They are reversible inhibitors of the blood clotting enzymes factor Xa (FXa) and/or factor Vila (FVIIa), and can in general be applied in conditions in which an undesired activity of factor Xa and/or factor Vila is present or for the cure or prevention of which an inhibition of factor Xa and/or factor Vila is intended. The invention furthermore relates to processes for the preparation of corresponds of the formula I  their use, in particular as active ingredients in pharmaceuticals, and pharmaceutical preparations comprising them.<br>
The ability to form blood clots is vital to survival. The formation of a blood clot or a thrombus is normally the result of tissue injury which initiates me coagulation cascade and has the effect of slowing or preventing bldod flow in wound healing. Other factors which are not directly related to tissue injury like atherosclerosis and inflammation may also initiate the coagulation cascade. In  a relationship exists between inflammation and the coagulation cascade.  mediators<br><br>
regulate the coagulation cascade and coagulation components influence the production and activity of inflammation mediators.<br>
However, in certain disease states the formation of blood clots within the circulatory system reaches an undesired extent and is itself the source of morbidity potentially leading to pathological consequences. It is nevertheless not desirable in suds disease states to completely inhibit the blood clotting system because life threatening hemorrhage would ensue. In the treatment of such states a well-balanced intervention into the blood clotting system is required, and there is still a need for substances exhibiting a suitable pharmacological activity profile for achieving such a result.<br>
Blood coagulation is a complex process involving a progressively amplified series of enzyme activation reactions in which plasma zymogens are sequentially activated by limited proteolysis. Mechanistically the blood coagulation cascade has been divided into intrinsic and extrinsic pathways, which converge at the activation of factor X. Subsequent generation of thrombin proceeds through a single common pathway (see Scheme 1). Present evidence suggests that the intrinsic pathway plays an important role in the maintenance and growth of fibrin formation, while the extrinsic pathway is critical in the initiation phase of blood coagulation. It is generally accepted that blood coagulation is physically initiated upon fomnation of a factor Vila/tissue faclor(TF) complex. Once formed, this complex rapidly iiiitiates coagulation by activating factors IX and X. The newly generated activated factor X. i. e. factor Xa, then forms a one-to-one complex with factor Va and phospholipids to form a prothrombinase complex, which is responsible for converting soluble fibrinogen to insoluble fibrin via the activation of thrombin from its precursor prothrombin.<br><br>

Scheme 1: Blood coagulation cascade<br>
As time progresses, the activity of the factor Vila/tissue factor complex (extrinsic pathv/ay) is suppressed by a Kunitz-type protease inhibitor protein, TFPI, which, when complexed to factor Xa, can directly inhibit the proteolytic activity of factor Vila/tissue factor. In order to maintain tfie coagulation process in the presence of an inhibited extrinsic system, additional factor Xa is produced via the thrombin-mediated activity of the intrinsic pathway. Thus, thrombin plays a dual autocatalytic role, mediating its own production and the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin. The autocatalytic nature of thrombin generation is an important safeguard against uncontrolled bleeding and it ensures that, once a giveh threshold level of prothfombinase is present, blood coagulation will proceed to completion. Thus, it is most desirable to develop agents that inhibit coagulation Without directly inhibiting thrombin but by inhibiting other steps in the coaguiatioh cascaoe like factor Xa and/or factor Vila activity<br>
■&gt; Fibrin<br>
In many clinical applications there is a great need for the preventioji of intravascular blood clots or for some anticoagulant treatment. For example, nearly 50 % of patients<br><br>
who have undergone a total hip replacement develop deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The currently available drugs like heparin and derivatives thereof are not satisfactory in many specific clinical applications. The currently approved therapies include fixed dose low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) and variable dose heparin. Even with these drug regimes 10 % to 20 % of patients develop DVT, and 5 % to 10 % develop bleeding complications.<br>
Another clinical situation for which better anticoagulants are needed concerns subjects undergoing transluminal coronary angioplasty and subjects at risk for myocardial infarction or suffering from crescendo angina. The present, conventionally accepted therapy which consists of administering heparin and aspirin, is associated with a 6 % to 8 % abrupt vessel closure rate within 24 hours of the procedure. The rate of bleeding complications requiring transfusion therapy due to the use of heparin also is approximately 7 %. Moreover, even though delayed closures are significant, administration of heparin after termination of the procedures is of little value and can be detrimental.<br>
The widely used blood clotting inhibitors like heparin and related sulfated polysaccharides like LMWH and heparin sulfate exert their anticlotting effects by promoting the binding of a natural regulator or the dotting process, antithrombin III, to thrombin and to factor Xa. The inhibitory activity of heparin primarily is directed toward thrombin, which is inactivated apprpxirnately 100 times faster than factor Xa. Hirudin and hiruldg are two additional thrpmbin specific anticoagulants. However, these anticoagulants which inhibit thrombin are also associated with bleeding complications. Preclinical stydies in baboons and dogs have shown that targeting enzymes involved at earlierstages of the coagulation cascade, such as factor Xa or factor Vila, prevents clot formation without producing the bleeding side effects observed with direct thrqmbiri inhibition.<br>
Several specific inhibitors of factor Xa have been reported. Both synthetic and protein inhibitors of factor Xa have been identified, these indude, for example, antistasin ("ATS") and tickJahticoagulant peptide {"TAP"). ATS, which is isolated from the leech,<br><br>
Haementerin officinalis, contains 119 amino acids and has a Ki for factor Xa of 0.05 nM. TAP, which is isolated from the tick, Omithodoros moubata, contains 60 amino acids and has a Ki for factor Xa of about 0.5 nM.<br>
The effectiveness of recombinantly produced ATS and TAP have been investigated in a number of animal model systems. Both inhibitors decrease bleeding time compared to other anticoagulants, and prevent clotting in a thromboplastin induced, ligated jugular vein model of deep vein thrombosis. The results achieved in this model correlate with results obtained using the current drug of choice, heparin.<br>
Subcutaneous ATS also was found to be an effective treatment in a thromboplastin induced model of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIG). TAP effectively prevents "high shear" arterial thrombosis and "reduced flow" caused by the surgical placement of a polyester ("DACRON") graft at levels that produced a clinically acceptable prolongation of the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), i.e. less than about two fold prolongation. By comparison, standard heparin, even at doses causing a five fold increase in the aPTT, did not prevent thrombosis and reduced flow within the graft. The aPTT Is a clinical assay of coagulation which is particularly sensitive to thrombin inhibitors.<br>
ATS and TAP have not been developed clinically. One major disadvanfage of these two inhibitors is that administration or tne required repeated doses causes the generation of neutralizing antibodies1 thus limiting their potential clinical use. Moreover, the sizes of TAP and ATS render oral adrpinistration impossible, further restricting the number of patients able to benefit from :these agents. An inhibitor of factor Xa with a favorable property profile would have substantial practical value in the practice of medicine. In particular, a factor Xa inhibitpr wpuld be effective under circumstances where the present drugs of choice, like heparin and related sulfated polysaccharides, are ineffective or only marginally effective.<br>
Low molecular weight, factor Xa-specific blood clotting inhibitors t|(at are effective but do not cause unwanted side effects have been described, for exanriple, in WO-A-<br><br>
95/29189. Indole derivatives as low molecular weight factor Xa-specific blood dotting inhibitors have been disclosed in VVO-A-99/33800. However, besides being an effective factor Xa-specific blood clotting inhibitor, it is desirable that such inhibitors also have further advantageous properties, for instance high stability in plasma and liver, high selectivity versus other serine proteases whose inhibition is not intended, such as thrombin, or inhibitory activity against serine proteases whose inhibition is desired, such as factor Vila. There is an ongoing need for further low molecular weight factor Xa specific blood clotting inhibitors which are effective and have the above advantages as well.<br>
Specific inhibition of the factor Vila/tissue factor catalytic complex using monoclonal antibodies (WO-A-92/06711) or a protein such as chloromethyl ketone inactivated factor Vila (WO-A-96/12800, WO-A-97/47651) is an extremely effective means of controlling thrombus formation caused by acute arterial injury or the thrombotic complications related to bacterial septicemia. There is also experimental evidence suggesting that inhibition of factor Vila/tissue factor activity inhibits restenosis following balloon angioplasty. Bleeding studies have been conducted in baboons and indicate that inhibition of the factor Vila/tissue factor complex has the widest safety window with respect to therapeutic effectiveness and bleeding risk of any anticoagulant approach tested including thrombin, platelet and factor Xa inhibition. Certain inhibitors of factor Vila have already been described. For example, WO-A-00/15658 (corresponding to EP-A-987274 (application no. 98117506.0)) discloses compounds containing a tripeptide unit which inhibit factor Vila. However, the property profile of these compounds is still not ideal, and there is an ongoing need for further low molecular weight factor Vila inhibitory blood clotting inhibitors.<br>
The present invention satisfies the above needs by providing novel compounds of the formula I which exhibit factor Xa and/or factor Vila inhibitory activity and are favorable agents for inhibiting unwanted blood clotting and thrombus formation.<br>
Thus, the present invention relates to compounds of the formula I,<br><br><br>

In general, the meaning of any group, residue, heteroatom, number etc. which can occur more than once in the compounds of the formula I, is independent of the meaning of this group, residue, heteroatom, number etc. in any other occurrence. All groups, residues, heteroatoms, numbers etc. which can occur more than once in the compounds of the formula 1 can be identical or different. For example, in case that a<br><br>
compound of the formula I contains two groups of the formula II they can be identical or different with respect to the number n and/or the group R°.<br>
As used herein, the term alkyl is to be understood in the broadest sense to mean hydrocarbon residues which can be linear, i. e. straight-chain, or branched and which can be acyclic or cyclic residues or comprise any combination of acyclic and cyclic subunits. Further, the term alkyl as used herein expressly includes saturated groups as well as unsaturated groups which"latter groups contain one or more, for example one, two or three, double bonds and/or triple bonds, provided that the double bonds are not located within a cyclic alkyl group in such a manner that an aromatic system results. All these statements also apply if an alkyl group occurs as a substituent on another residue, for example in an alkyloxy residue, an alkyloxycarbonyi residue or an aryialkyi residue. Examples of alkyl residues containing 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 or 12 carbon atoms are methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl, hexyl, heptyl, octyl, nonyl, decyl, undecyl, dodecyl, the n-isomers of all these residues, isopropyl, isobutyl, 1-methylbutyl, isopentyl, neopentyl, 2,2-dimethylbutyl, 2-methylpentyl, 3-methylpentyl, isohexyl, sec-butyl, tert-butyl, tert-pentyl, 2,3,4-trimethylhexyl or isodecyl.<br>
Unsaturated alkyl residues are, for example, alkenyl residues such as vinyl, 1-propenyl, 2-propenyl (= allyl), 2-butenyl, 3-butenyl, 2-methyl-2-butenyl, 3-methyl-2-butenyl, 5-hexenyl or 1,3-pentadienyl, or alkynyl residues such as ethynyl, 1-propynyl, 2-propynyl (= propargyl) or 2-butynyl. Alkyl residues can also be unsaturated when they are substituted.<br>
Examples of cyclic alkyl residues are cycloalkyi residues containing 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8 ring carbon atoms like cyciopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, cycloheptyl or cyclooctyl which can also be substituted and/or unsaturated. Unsaturated cyclic alkyl groups and unsaturated cycloalkyi groups like, for example, cydopentenyl or cyclohexenyl can be bonded via any carbon atom. The term alkyl as used herein also comprises cycloalkyl-substituted alkyl groups like cyclopropylmethyl-, cyclobutylmethyl-, cyclopentyimethyl-, cyclohexylmethyl-, cycloheptylmethyl-, 1-<br><br>
cyclopropylethyl-, 1-cyclobutylethyl-, 1-cyclopentylethyl-, 1-cyclohex&gt;'lethy!-, 2-cyclopropylethyl-, 2-cyclobutylethyl-, 2-cyclopentylethyi-, 2-cyciohexylethyl-, 3-cyclopropylpropyl-, 3-cyclobutylpropy!-, 3-cyciopentylpropyl etc. in which groups the cycloalkyi subgroup as well as acyclic subgroup can be unsaturated and/or substituted.<br>
Of course, a cyclic alkyl group has to contain at least three carbon atoms, and an unsaturated alkyl group has to contain at least two carbon atoms. Thus, a group like (Ci-C8)-alkyl is to be understood as comprising, among others, saturated acyclic (Ci-C8)-alkyl, (C3-Ca)-cycloalkyl, cydoalkyl-alkyi groups like (C3-C7)-cycloalkyl-(Ci-C5)-alkyl- wherein the total number of carbon atoms can range from 4 to 8, and unsaturated (C2-C8)-alkyl like (C2-C8)-alkenyl or (C2-C8)-alkynyl. Similarly, a group like (Ci-C4)-alkyl is to be understood as comprising, among others, saturated acyclic {Ci-C4)-alkyl, (C3-C4)-cycloalkyl, cydopropyl-methyl-, and unsaturated (C2-C4)-alkyl like (C2-C4)-alkenyl or (C2-C4)-alkynyl.<br>
Unless stated otherwise, the term alkyl preferably comprises acyclic saturated<br>
hydrocarbon residues which can be linear or branched and which more preferably<br>
have from one to six carbon atoms. A particular group of saturated acyclic alkyl<br>
residues is formed by (Ci-C4)-alkyl residues like methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-<br>
butyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl and tert-butyl.	' ~<br>
Unless stated otherwise, and irrespective of any specific substituents bonded to alkyl groups which are indicated in the definition of the compounds of the formula I, alkyl groups can in genera! be unsubstituted or substituted by one or more, for example one, two, three, four or five, identical or different substituents. Any kind of substituents present in substituted alkyl residues can be present in any desired position provided that the substitution does not lead to an unstable molecule. Examples of substituted alkyl residues are alkyl residues in which one or more, for example 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5, hydrogen atoms are replaced with halogen atoms, in particular fluorine atoms.<br><br>
The term aryl refers to a monocyclic or polycyclic hydrocarbon residue in which at least one carbocydic ring is present that has a conjugated pi electron system. In a (C6-Ci4)-aryl residue from 6 to 14 ring carbon atoms are present. Examples of (Ce-Ci4)-aryl residues are phenyl, naphthyl, biphenyiyi, fluorenyl or anthracenyl. Examples of (C6-Cio)-aryl residues are phenyl or naphthyl. Unless stated otherwise, and irrespective of any specific substituents bonded to aryl groups which are indicated in the definition of the compounds of the formula I, aryl residues, for example phenyl, naphthyl orfluorenyl, can in general be unsubstituted or substituted by one or more, for example one, two, three or four, identical or different substituents. Aryl residues can be bonded via any desired position, and in substituted aryl residues the substituents can be located in any desired position.<br>
Unless stated otherwise, and irrespective of any specific substituents bonded to aryl groups which are indicated in the definition of the compounds of the formula 1, substituents that can be present in substituted aryl groups are, for example, (Ci-Cs)-alkyl, in particular (Ci-C4)-alkyl, such as methyl, ethyl or tert-butyl, hydroxy, (Ci-Cs)-alkyloxy, in particular {Ci-C4)-alkyloxy, such as methoxy, ethoxy or tert-butoxy, methylenedioxy, ethylenedioxy, F, CI, Br, I, cyano, nitro, trifluoromethyl, trifluoromethoxy, hydroxymethyl, formyl, acetyl, amino, mono- or di-(Ci-C4)-alkyiamino, ((Ci-C4)-aIkyl)carfaonylamino like acetylamino, hydroxycarbonyl, ((C1-C4)-alkyloxy)carbonyl, carbamoyl, optionally substituted phenyl, benzyl optibiTally substituted in the phenyl group, optionally substituted phenoxy or benzyloxy optionally substituted in the phenyl group. A substituted aryl group that can be present in a specific position of the compounds of formula I can independently of other aryl groups be substituted by substituents selected from any desired subgroup of the substituents listed before and/or in the specific definition of that group. For example, a substituted aryl group may be substituted by one or more identical or different substituents chosen from (Ci-C4)-alkyl, hydroxy, (Ci-C4}-alkyloxy, F, CI, Br, I, cyano, nitro, trifluoromethyl, amino, phenyl, benzyl, phenoxy and benzyloxy. In general, preferably not more than two nitro groups are present in the compounds of the formula I,<br><br>
In monosubstituted phenyl residues the substituent can be located in the 2-position, the 3-position or the 4-position, with the 3-position and the 4-position being preferred. If a phenyl group carries two substituents, they can be located in 2,3-position, 2,4-position, 2,5-position, 2,6-position, 3,4-position or 3,5-position. In phenyl residues carrying three substituents the substituents can be located in 2,3,4-position, 2,3,5-position, 2,3,6-position, 2,4,5-position, 2,4,6-position, or 3,4,5-position. Naphthyl residues can be 1-naphthyl and 2-naphthyl. In substituted naphthyl residues the substituents can be located in any positions, for example in monosubstituted 1-.naphthyl residues in the 2- 3-, 4- 5-, 6-, 7-, or 8-position and in monosubstituted 2-naphthyl residues in the 1-, 3-, 4-, 5-, 6.-, 7- or 8-position. Biphenylyl residues can be 2-biphenylyl, 3-biphenylyl and 4-biphenylyl. Fluorenyl residues can be 1-, 2-, 3-, 4- or 9-fluorenyl. In monosubstituted fluorenyl residues bonded via the 9-position the substituent is pre/erably present in the 1-, 2-, 3- or 4-position.<br>
The above statements relating to aryl groups correspondingly apply to the aryl subgroup in arylalkyl- groups. Examples of arylalkyi- groups which can also be unsubstituted or substituted in the aryl subgroup as well as in the alkyl subgroup, are benzyl, 1-phenylethyl, 2-phenylethyl, 3-phenylpropyl, 4-phenylbutyl, 1-methyl-3-phenyl-propyl, 1-naphthylmethyl, 2-naphthylmethyl, 1-(1-naphthyl)ethyl, 1-(2-naphthyl)ethyl, 2-{1-naphthyl)ethyl, 2-(2-naphthyI)ethyl, or 9-fluorenylmethy!.<br>
The group Het comprises groups containing 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10 ring atoms in the parent monocyclic or bicyclic heterocyclic ring system. In monocyclic groups Het the heterocyclic ring preferably is a 3-membered, 4-membered, 5-membered, 6-membered or 7-membered ring, particularly preferably a 5-membered or 6-membered ring. In bicyclic groups Het preferably two fused rings are present one of which is a 5-membered ring or 6-membered heterocyclic ring and the other of which is a 5-membered or 6-membered heterocyclic or carbocydic ring, i. e., a bicyclic ring Het preferably contains 8, 9 or 10 ring atoms, particulariy preferably 9 or 10 ring atoms.<br><br>
Het comprises saturated heterocyclic ring systems which do not contain any double bonds within the rings, as well as mono-unsaturated and poly-unsaturated heterocyctic ring systems which contain one or more, for example one, two, three, four or five, double bonds within the rings provided that the resulting system is stable. Unsaturated rings may be non-aromatic or aromatic, i. e. double bonds within the rings in the group Het may be arranged in such a manner that a conjugated pi electron system results. Aromatic rings in a group Het may be 5-membered or 6-membered rings, i. e. aromatic groups in a group Het contain 5 to 10 ring atoms. Aromatic rings in a group Het thus comprise 5-membered and 6-membered monocyclic heterocydes and bicydic heterocydes composed of two 5-membered rings, one 5-membered ring and one 6-membered ring, or two 6-membered rings. In bicydic aromatic groups in a group Het one or both rings may contain heteroatoms. Aromatic groups Het may also be referred to by the customary term heteroaryl for which all the definitions and explanations above and below relating to Het correspondingly apply.<br>
Unless stated otherwise, in the groups Het and any other heterocyclic groups preferably 1, 2, 3 or 4 identical or different ring heteroatoms chosen from nitrogen, oxygen and sulfur are present. Particularly preferably in these groups one or two identical or different heteroatoms chosen from nitrogen, oxygen and sulfur are present. The ring heteroatoms can be present in any desired number andHn any position with respect to each other provided that the resulting heterocyclic system is known in the art and is stable and suitable as a subgroup in a drug substance. Examples of parent structures of heterocydes from which the group Het can be derived are aziridine, oxirane, azetidine, pyrrole, furan, thiophene, dioxole, imidazole, pyrazole, oxazole, isoxazole, thiazole, isothiazole, 1,2,3-triazole, 1,2,4-triazole, tetrazole, pyridine, pyran, thiopyran, pyridazine, pyrimidine, pyrazine, 1,2-oxazine, 1,3-oxazine, 1,4-oxazine, 1,2-thiazine, 1,3-thiazine, 1,4-thiazine, 1,2,3-triazine, 1,2,4-triazine, 1,3,5-triazine, azepine, 1,2-diazepine, I.S-diazepine, 1,4-diazepine, indole, isoindole, benzofuran, benzothiophene, 1,3-benzodioxole, indazole, benzimidazole, benzoxazole, benzothiazole, quinoline, isoquinoline, chromane, isochromane, cinnoline, quinazoline, quinoxaline, phthalazine, pyridoimidazoles, pyridopyridines,<br><br>
pyndopyrimidines, purine, pteridine etc. as well as ring systems which result from the listed heterocydes by fusion (or condensation) of a carbocydic ring, for example benzo-fused, cyclopenta-fused, cyclohexa-fused or cyclohepta-fused derivatives of these heterocydes.<br>
The fact that many of the before-listed names of heterocydes are the chemical names of unsaturated or aromatic ring systems does not imply that the groups Het could only be derived from the respective unsaturated ring system.- The names here only serve to describe the ring system with respect to ring size and the number of the heteroatoms and their relative positions. As explained above, the group Het can be saturated or partially unsaturated or aromatic, and can thus be derived not only from the before-listed heterocydes themselves but also from all their partially or completely hydrogenated analogues and also from their more highly unsaturated analogues if applicable. As examples of completely or partially hydrogenated analogues of the before-listed heterocydes from which the groups Het may be derived the following may be mentioned: pyrroline, pyrrolidine, tetrahydrofuran, tetrahydrothiophene, dihydropyridine, tetrahydropyridine, piperidine, 1,3-dioxolane, 2-imidazoline, imidazolidine, 4,5-dihydro-1,3-oxazol, 1,3-oxazolidine, 4,5-dihydro-1,3-thiazole, I.S-thiazolidine, perhydro-1,4-dioxane, piperazine, perhydro-1,4-oxazine (= morpholine), perhydro-1,4-thiazine (= thiomorpholine), perhydroazepine, jndoline, isoindoline, 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoline, 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoqu(noline, etc.<br>
The residue Het may be bonded via any ring carbon atom, and in the case of nitrogen heterocydes via any suitable ring nitrogen atom. Thus, for example, a pyrrolyl residue can be 1-pyrrolyl, 2-pyrrolyl or 3-pyrrolyl, a pyrrolidinyl residue can be pyrrolidin-1-yl (= pyrrolidino), pyrrolidin-2-yl or pyrrolidin-3-yl, a pyridinyl residue can be pyridin-2-yl, pyridin-3-yl or pyridin-4-yl, a piperidinyl residue can be piperidin-1-yl (= piperidino), piperidin-2-yl, piperidin-3-yl or piperidin-4-yl. Fury! can be 2-furyl or 3-furyl, thienyl can be 2-thienyl or 3-thienyl, imidazolyi can be imidazol-1-yl, imidazol-2-yl, imidazol-4-yl or imidazol-5-yl, 1,3-oxazolyl can be 1,3-oxazol-2-yl, 1,3-oxazol-4-yl or 1,3-oxazo!-5-yl, 1,3-thiazolyl can be 13-thiazol-2-yl, 1,3-thiazol-4-yl or 1,3-thiazol-5-yl, pyrimidinyl can be pyr;midin-2-y!. pyrimidin-4-yl (= 5-pyrimidinyl) or 5-pyrimidinyl,<br><br>
piperazinyl can be piperazin-l-yl (= piperazin-1-yl = piperazino) or piperazin-2-yl, Indoiyi can be indol-1-y!, indol-2-y!, indol-3-yl, indoM-yl, indol-5-yl, indoi-6-yl orindoi-7-yl. Similarly benzimidazolyl, benzoxazolyl and benzothiazol residues can be bonded via the 2-position and via any of the positions 4, 5, 6, and 7. Quinolinyl can be quinolin-2-yl, quinolin-3-y!, quinolin-4-yl, quinolin-5-yl, quinolin-6-yl, quinoIin-7-yl or quinolin-8-yi, isoqinolinyl can be isoquinol-1-yi, isoquinolin-3-yl, isoquino!in-4-yl, isoquinolin-5-yi, isoquinolin-6-yl, isoquinolin-7-yl or isoquinolin-8-yl. In addition to being bonded via any of the positions indicated for quinolinyl and isoquinolinyl, 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinolinyl and 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolinyl can also be bonded via the nitrogen atoms in 1-position and 2-position, respectively.<br>
Unless stated otherwise, and irrespective of any specific substituents bonded to groups Het or any other heterocyclic groups which are indicated in the definition of the compounds of the formula I, the group Het can be unsubstituted or substituted on ring carbon atoms with one or more, for example one, two, three, four or five, identical or different substituents like (Ci-C8)-alkyl, in particular (Ci-C4)-alkyl, (Ci-Ca)-alkyloxy, in particular (Ci-C4)-alkyloxy, (Ci-C4)-alkylthio, halogen, nitro, amino, ((Ci-C4)-alkyl)carbonylamino like acetylamino, trifluoromethyl, trifluoromethoxy, hydroxy, 0X0, hydroxy-(Ci-C4)-alkyl such as, for example, hydroxymethyl or 1-hydroxyethyl or 2-hydroxyethyl, methylenedioxy, ethylenedioxy, formyl, acetyl, cyano, methylsulfonyl, hydroxycarbonyl, aminocarbonyl, (Ci-C4)-alkyloxycarbonyl, optionally subitituted phenyl, optionally substituted phenoxy, benzyl optionally substituted in the phenyl group, benzyloxy optionally substituted in the phenyl group, etc. The substituents can be present in any desired position provided that a stable molecule results. Of course an 0X0 group cannot be present in an aromatic ring. Each suitable ring nitrogen atom in a group Het can independently of each other be unsubstituted, i. e. carry a hydrogen atom, or can be substituted, i. e. carry a substituent like (Ci-C8)-aIkyl, for example (Ci-C4)-alkyl such as methyl or ethyl, optionally substituted phenyl, phenyl-(Ci-C4)-alkyl, for example benzyl, optionally substituted in the phenyl group, hydroxy-(C2-C4)-aikyl such as, for example 2-hydroxyethy!, acetyl or another acyl group, methylsulfonyl or another sulfonyl group, aminocarbonyl, (Ci-C4)-alkyloxycarbonyl, etc. In general, in the compounds of the formula I nitrogen heterocycles can also be<br><br>
present as N-oxides or as quaternary salts. Ring sulfur atoms can be oxidized to the sulfoxide or to the suifone. Thus, for example, a tetrahydrothienyi residue may be present as S,S-dioxotetrahydrothienyl residue, or a thiomorpholinyl residue like thiomorpholin-4-yl may be present as 1-oxo-thiomorpholin-4-yl or 1,1-dioxo-thiomorpholin-4-yl. A substituted group Het that can be present in a specific position of the compounds of formula I can independently of other groups Het be substituted by substituents selected from any desired subgroup of the substituents listed before and/or in the definition of that group.<br>
The above statements relating to the residue Het also correspondingly apply to the Het subgroup in the groups Het-alkyI-. Examples of such groups Het-alkyI- which can also be unsubstituted or substituted in the Het subgroup as well as in the alkyl subgroup, are {pyridin-2-yl)-methyl, (pyridin-3-yI)-methyl, {pyridin-4-yl)-methyl, 2-(pyridin-2-yl)-ethyl, 2-(pyridin-3-yl)-ethyl or 2-(pyridin-4-yl)-€thyl. As far as applicable, the above statements relating to the residue Het also apply to the heteroaryl group that can represent the group R°, and to a heterocyclic ring that is formed by two groups together with the nitrogen atom to which they are bonded.<br>
Halogen is fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine, preferably fluorine, chlorine or bromine, particulariy preferably chlorine or bromine.<br>
Optically active carbon atoms present in the compounds of the formula I can independently of each other have R configuration or S configuration. The compounds of the formula I can be present in the form of pure or substantially pure enantiomers or pure or substantially pure diastereomers, or in the form of mixtures of enantiomers and/or diastereomers, for example in the form of racemates. The present invention relates to pure enantiomers and mixtures of enantiomers as well as to pure diastereomers and mixtures of diastereomers. The invention comprises mixtures of two or of more than two stereoisomers of the formula I, and it comprises all ratios of the stereoisomers in the mixtures, in case the compounds of the formula I can be present as E isomers or Z isomers (or cis isomers cr trans isomers) the invention relates both to Dure E isomers and pure Z isomers and to E/Z mixtures in all ratios.<br><br>
The invention also comprises all tautomeric forms of the compounds of the formula I.<br>
Diastereomers, including E/Z isomers, can be separated into the individual isomers by chromatography, for example. Racemates can be separated into the tv1'o enantiomers by customary methods, for example by chromatography on chirai phases or by resolution, for example by crystallization of diastereomeric salts obtained with optically active acids or bases. Stereochemicaliy unifom compounds of the formula I can also be obtained by employing stereochemicaliy uniform starting materials or by using stereoselective reactions.<br>
The choice of incorporating into a compound of the formula I a building block with R configuration or S configuration, or in the case of an amino acid unit present in a compound of the formula I of incorporating a building block designated as D-amino acid or L-amino acid, can depend, for example, on the desired characteristics of the compound of the formula I. For example, the incorporation of a D-amino acid building block can confer increased stability in vitro or in vivo. The incorporation of a D-amino acid building block also can achieve a desired increase or decrease in the pharmacological activity of the compound. In some cases it can be desirable to allow the compound to remain active for only a short period of time, in such cases, the incorporation of an L-amino acid building block in the compound can allow endogenous peptidases in an individual to digest the compound In vivo1 fRereby limiting the individual's exposure to the active compound. A similar effect may also be observed in the compounds of the invention by changing the configuration in another building block from S configuration to R configuration or vice versa. By taking into consideration the medical needs a person skilled in the art can determine the desirable characteristics, for example a favorable stereochemistry, of the required compound of the invention.<br>
Physiologically tolerable salts of the compounds of formula I are nontoxic salts that are physiologically acceptable, in particular pharmaceutically utilizable salts. Such salts of compounds of the formula I containing acidic groups, for example a carboxy group COOH, are for example alkali metal salts or alkaline earth metal salts such as<br><br>
sodium salts, potassium salts, magnesium salts and calcium salts, and also salts with physiologically tolerable quartemary ammonium ions such as tetramethylammonium or tetraethyiammonium, and acid addition salts with ammonia and physiologically tolerable organic amines, such as methylamine, dimethylamine, trimethylamine, ethylamine, triethylamine, ethanolamine or tris-(2-hydroxyethyl)amine. Basic groups contained in the compounds of the formula 1, for example amino groups or guanidino groups, form acid addition salts, for example with inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid or phosphoric acid, or with organic carboxylic acids and sulfonic acids such as formic acid, acetic acid, oxalic acid, citric acid, lactic acid, malic acid, succinic acid, malonic acid, benzoic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, tartaric acid, methanesulfonic acid or p-toluenesulfonic acid. Compounds of the formula I which simultaneously contain a basic group and an acidic group, for example a guanidino group and a carboxy group, can also be present as zwitterions (betaines) which are likewise included in the present invention.<br>
Salts of compounds of the formula I can be obtained by customary methods known to those skilled in the art, for example by combining a compound of the formula I with an inorganic or organic acid or base in a solvent or dispersant, or from other salts by cation exchange or anion exchange. The present invention also includes all salts of the compounds of the formula I which, because of low physiologically tolerability, are not directly suitable for use in pharmaceuticals but are suitable, for example, as intermediates for carrying out further chemical modifications of the compounds of the formula I or as starting materials for the preparation of physiologically tolerable salts. The present invention furthermore includes all solvates of compounds of the formula 1, for example hydrates or adducts with alcohols. The invention also includes derivatives and modifications of the compounds of the formula I, for example prodnjgs, protected forms and other physiologically tolerable derivatives including esters and amides, as well as active metabolites of the compounds of the formula I. Such esters and amides are, for example, (Ci-C4)-alkyl esters, unsubstituted amides or (Ci-Cs}-alkylam,ides. The invention relates in particular to prodrugs and protected ferns of the compounds of the formula I which can be converted into compounds of<br><br>
the formula I under physiological conditions. Suitable prodrugs for the compounds of the formula I, i. e. chemically modified derivatives of the compounds of the formula 1 having properties which are improved in a desired manner, for example with respect to solubility, bioavailability or duration of action, are known to those skilled in the art. More detailed information relating to prodrugs is found in standard literature like, for example, Design of Prodrugs, H. Bundgaard (ed.), Elsevier, 1985; D. Fleisheret al.. Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews 19 (1996) 115-130; or H. Bundgaard, Drugs of the Future 16 (1991) 443 which are all incorporated herein by reference. Suitable prodrugs for the compounds of the formula 1 are especially ester prodrugs and amide prodrugs of carboxyiic acid groups, and also acyl prodrugs and carbamate prodrugs of acylatable nitrogen-containing groups such as amino groups and the guanidino group. In the acyl prodrugs and carbamate prodrugs one or more, for example one or two, hydrogen atoms on nitrogen atoms in such groups are replaced with an acyl group or a carbamate group. Suitable acyl groups and carbamate groups for acyl prodrugs and carbamate prodrugs are, for example, the groups R11-CO- and RP1O-CO- in which R"1 is hydrogen, (Ci-Ci8)-alkyl, (C3-C8}-cycloalkyl, (Ca-Cs)-cycloalkyl-(Ci-C4)-alkyl-, (C6-Ci4)-aryl, Het-, (C6-Ci4)-aryl-(Ci-C4)-alkyl-or Het-(Ci-C4)-alkyl- and in which R'1 has the meanings indicated for R11 with the exception of hydrogen.<br>
A specific subgroup of compounds of the present invention is formed by compounds in which A is R'1R1N-, and another specific subgroup of compounds of the present invention is formed by compounds in which A is R1O-. Independently thereof, a specific subgroup of compounds of the present invention is fomned by compounds in<br>

The preceding explanations correspondingly apply to aromatic ring systems in which three ring nitrogen atoms are present.<br>
In general, any one or two of the groups Y in the aromatic ring depicted in the 3   formula I which are no nitrogen atoms can be carbon atoms carrying a group of the formula II. Thus, if one group Y is a carbon atom carrying a group of the formula II, the group of the formula II can be present in a 2-position or in a 3-position or in the 4-position with respect to the ring carbon atom carrying the amide group C(=0)-NH depicted in the formula I.

4-position with respect to the carbon atom carrying the amide group C(=0)-NH depicted in the formula I, particularly preferably in the 3-position with respect to said carbon atom. If two groups Y are carbon atoms carrying a group of the formula II, the groups of the formula II can be present in positions 2 and 3, positions 2 and 4, positions 2 and 5, positions 2 and 6, positions 3 and 4 or positions 3 and 5 with respect to the nng carbon atom carrying the amide group C(=0)-NH depicted in the formula I.

In case of a pyridine-4-carboxamide moiety of the formula Hid the group of the formula II can be present in a 2-position or a 3-position with respect to the ring nitrogen atom in the 1-position, the 2-positions being preferred. Just so in all compounds of the formula I containing a diaza-arenecarboxamide moiety of the formulae llle to Illj and containing only one group Y which is a carbon atom carrying a group of the formula II, the group of the formula II can be present in any position. For example, in a compound of the formula I containing a pyrimidine-4-carboxamide moiety of the formula lllh, the group of the formula II can be present in the 2-position (formula lllh-1) or the 5-position (formula IIIh-2) or the 6-position (formula llih-3) with respect to the ring nitrogen atoms in positions 1 and 3 and the carboxamide group in position 4, the 2-position and the 6-position being prefen-ed and the 6-position being particularly preferred.

The groups R1 are preferably chosen from hydrogen, halogen, hydroxy, nitro, R''R11N- and (Ci-Csj-alkyloxy, where a (Ci-C8)-alkyloxy group representing R1 preferably is (Ci-C4)-alkyloxy and particularly preferably is methoxy, and where a preferred group R11R11N- representing R1 preferably is the amino group NH2. if an alky! group or aryl group present in a group R1 is substituted by one or more identical or different substituents R11 it is preferably substituted by one, two, three, four or five, in particular one, two or three, identical or different substitutents R11. Examples of groups R1 in which an alkyl group or aryl group is substituted by R"*1 are aminomethyl, hydroxy methyl, trifluoromethyl, trifluoromethoxy, 2,2,3,3,3-pentafluoropropoxy, 2-methoxyethoxy or 3,4-di methoxy phenyl.<br>
The number of the groups R1 which can be present in the aromatic ring system CY5 depends on the number of the groups of the formula II and the number of ring nitrogen atoms that are present, and can be zero, one, two, three or four. Preferably, one, two or three of the groups R1 that are present have any one of the meanings of R1 given above including hydrogen, and a fourth group R1 that may be present is hydrogen. More preferably, one or two of the groups R1 that are present have any one of the meanings of R' given above including hydrogen, and a third and fourth group R1 that may be present are hydrogen. For example, in compounds of the formula I which contain a benzamide moiety of the formula Ilia and only one group of the formula II, preferably one, two or three of the four groups R1 that are present denote hydrogen or a group different from hydrogen, and the fourth group R' denotes hydrogen. More preferably in compounds of the formula I which contain a benzamide moiety of the formula Ilia and only one group of the formula 11, one or two of the four groups R1 that are present denote hydrogen or a group different from hydrogen, and the third and the fourth grouD R1 denote hydrogen. Moreover, in the case of<br><br>
compounds of the formula I which contain a benzamide moiety of the formula lila and only one group of the formula li, in a preferred embodiment of the present invention one or two groups R1 are different from hydrogen and three or two groups R1 are hydrogen. In the case of compounds of the formula I which contain a pyridinecarboxamide or a diaza-arenecarboxamide moiety of the formulae lllb to illj and only one group of the formula II, in a preferred embodiment of the present invention all groups R1 are hydrogen or one group R' is different from hydrogen and the remaining groups R1 are hydrogen. Any groups R1 that are different from hydrogen can be present in any desired position of the aromatic ring system CYs, provided a sufficiently stable molecule results that is suitable for the desired purpose. For example, if a compound of the formula 1 contains a benzamide moiety of the formula lila and only one group of the formula II and one or two groups R1 that are different from hydrogen, those groups R1 can be present in any of the positions 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 (with respect to the amide group C(=0)-NH in the 1-position), as far as the respective positions are not occupied by the group of the formula il. If in the case of a compound of the formula 1 containing a benzamide moiety of the formula Ilia and a single group of the formula II in the 3-position (with respect to the amide group C(=0)-NH in the 1-position) a single group R1 that is different from hydrogen is present, that group R1 preferably is present in the 4-position or in the 5-position, particularly preferably in the 4-position. If in the case of a compound of the formula 1 containing a benzamide moiety of the formula lila and a single group of tFe formula II in the 3-position (with respect to the amide group C(=0)-NH in the 1-position) two groups R1 that are different from hydrogen are present, those groups are preferably present in positions 4 and 5.<br>
Besides having the before-mentioned preferred denotations, in further preferred embodiments of the present invention the ring system CYs and substituents R1 together form a polycyciic aromatic ring system If two groups R1 bonded to adjacent ring carbon atoms together with the carbon atoms to which they are bonded form an aromatic ring condensed to the ring CYs depicted in formula I, the resulting bicyciic aromatic ring system preferably comprises two condensed 6-membered rings. One o the two condensed 6-membered rings, i. e. the ring CYs which is depicted in the<br><br>
formula I and which carries the groups of the formula 11, contains zero, one or two ring nitrogen atoms, and the second ring, i.e. the additional ring formed by the two groups R\ preferably is a benzene ring comprising only carbon atoms as ring atoms. Thus, in this latter embodiment of the invention the two residues R1- which are bonded to adjacent carbon atoms and which together with the carbon atoms to which they are bonded form a condensed benzene ring, can be regarded as forming a divalent residue of the fonmula -C(R11)=C(R11)-C(R11)=C(R11)- the terminal carbon atom of which are bonded to two adjacent carbon atoms in the ring system CY5, and in which the groups R11 which are identical or different, are chosen from hydrogen and R11. Examples of parent structures from which such a condensed aromatic ring system can be derived are naphthalene, quinoline, isoquinoline, cinnoline, quinazoline, quinoxaline and phthalazine. The amide group C(=0)-NH- and the groups of the formula II can be located in any position in the ring which corresponds to the ring CY5 depicted in the formula I. Thus the compounds of the formula I can inter alia contain, for example, a naphthalene-1-carboxamide moiety of the formula lllk, a naphthalene-2-carboxamide moiety of the formula lllm, a quinoline-2-carboxamide moiety of the formula llln, a quinoline-3-carboxamide moiety of the formula lllo, a quinoline-4-carboxamide moiety of the formula I lip, an isoquinoline-1-carboxamide moiety of the formula Illq, an isoquinoline-3-carboxamide moiety of the formula lllr or a quinazoline-2-carboxamide moiety of the formula Ills,<br><br><br>

in all of which one or two of the groups R are identical or different groups of the formula II and the remaining of the groups R are identical or different groups R', and the groups R11 are identical or different groups chosen from hydrogen and R11, As in 0   the cases were the ring system CY5 is a monocyclic ring, groups R representing groups of the formula II can be present in any position. For example, if a compound of the formula I contains a naphthaiene-1-carboxamide moiety of the formula lllk anc<br><br>
only one group of the formula II is present, it can be present in positions 2, 3 and 4 of the naphthalene system of which the 3-position is preferred. If a compound of the formula I contains a naphthalene-2-carboxamide moiety of the formula lllm and only one group of the formula II is present, it can be present in positions 1, 3 and 4 of the naphthalene system of which the 4-position is preferred. If a compound of the formula I contains a quinoline-2-carboxamide moiety of the formula llln and only one group of the formula II is present, it can be present in positions 3 and 4 of the quinoline system of which the 4-position is preferred.<br>
The groups R1 which may be present in the group R° are preferably chosen from halogen and (Ci-C4)-alkyl, where alkyl groups representing R1 are unsubstituted or substituted by one or more identical or different halogen atoms. Particularly preferably substituents R1 are identical or different halogen atoms, in particular halogen atoms chosen from fluorine, chlorine and bromine. If an alkyl group present<br>
'   in a group R1 is substituted by one or more identical or different halogen atoms it is preferably substituted by one, two, three, four or five, in particular one, two or three, identical or different halogen atoms. Examples of groups R1 in which an alkyl group is substituted by halogen atoms are trifiuoromethyl, trifluoromethoxy or 2,2,3,3,3-pentafluoropropoxy.<br>
I<br>
If the groups alkyl, aryl and Het present in R1, R'* and R1 are substituted 5y one or more identical or different substituents R11, they are preferably substituted by one, two, three, four or five, in particular one, two or three, identical or different substituents R11 which substituents can be present in any positions, provided that a<br>

R1 preferably is hydrogen or {Ci-C6)-alkyl, where the alkyl group representing R1 is unsubstituted or substituted by one or more identical or different substituents R11. Preferably one of the groups R"* and R1 is hydrogen or (Ci-C4)-alkyl, in particular hydrogen, and the other of the groups R" and R1 is chosen from hydrogen, (Ci-Ci2)-alkyl, (C6-Ci4)-aryl-<br>

which they are bonded form a saturated 3-membered to 8-membered heterocyclic ring which in addition to the nitrogen atom carrying R' and R1 can contain one or two identical or different ring heteroatoms chosen from oxygen, sulfur and nitrogen. A heterocyclic ring formed by R'* and R1 together with the nitrogen atom to which they are bonded preferably contains no additional ring heteroatom or one additional ring heteroatom chosen from nitrogen, oxygen and sulfur. Examples of such heterocyclic rings are aziridine, azetidine, pyrrolidine, 1,2-oxazolidine, 1,3-oxazolidine, 1,2-thiazolidine, 1,3-thiazolidine, piperidine, morpholine, thiomorpholine, piperazine, perhydroazepine or perhydroazocine ail of which are bonded via a ring nitrogen atom and can be substituted as outlined above. Preferred heterocyclic rings formed by R"* and R1 together with the nitrogen atom to which they are bonded are aziridine, azetidine, pyrrolidine and piperidine.<br>
If alkyl and aryl groups present in R'1 and R11 are substituted by one or more identical or different substituents R11, they are preferably substituted by one, two, three, four or five, in particular one, two or three, identical or different substituents R'1 which substituents can be present in any positions, provided that a stable molecule results which is suitable for the desired purpose.

The ring heteroatoms can be present in any desired positions. Preferably the heterocyclic ring is saturated. If it is unsaturated it preferably contains one or two double bonds in the ring. Preferably the heterocyclic ring is a 5-membered or 6-<br>

Carbon atoms substituted by oxo can be present in any positions, including the positions adjacent to ring heteroatoms and in particular the positions adjacent to the nitrogen atom carrying the groups R11 and R11. Examples of such oxo-substituted heterocyclic ring are pyrrolidine-2,5-dione, imidazolidine-2,4-dione, oxazolidine-2,4-dione, pyrrolidine-2-one, imidazolidin-2-one, pyrazolidine-3,5-dione, piperidine-2Hone, piperazine-2-one, morpholine-3-one, piperidine-2,6-dione, etc.<br>
Preferred compounds of the formula I are those compounds in which one or more of the groups or residues or numbers have preferred denotations or have one or more specific denotations of the denotations listed in their respective definitions and the general explanations relating to the respective groups and residues. AJI combinations of such preferred denotations and specific denotations are a subject of the present invention. As the compounds of the formula I in general, just so all preferred compounds of the formula I are a subject of the present invention in all their stereoisomeric forms and mixtures thereof in any ratio, and in the form of their physiologically tolerable salts. Further, also all preferred compounds of the formula I are a subject of the present invention in the form of their prodrugs and other derivatives as explained above, for example in the form of their esters or amides such as unsubstituted amides, (Ci-C8)-alkyl amides and other amides, or their acyl prodrugs or carbamate prodrugs.<br>
For example, preferred compounds of the formula I are compounds in which one of the groups Y is a carbon atom candying a group of the formula II,<br>
R°-(CH2)n-0-	II<br><br>
and zero, one or two of the groups Y are nitrogen atoms, and the remaining groups Y are carbon atoms carrying a group R\ where the groups Y are independent of each other and can be identical or different;<br>
A is R'*R1N-;<br>

n is 2;<br>
R° is phenyl which is unsubstituted or substituted by one or two identical or different substituents;<br>
in all their stereoisomeric forms and mixtures thereof in any ratio, and their physiologically tolerable salts.<br>
The present invention also relates to processes of preparation by which the compounds of the formula I are obtainable. The compounds of the fonmula 1 can generally be prepared by linking of two or more fragments (or building blocks) which can be derived retrosynthetically from the formula I. In the preparation of the compounds of the formula I it can generally be advantageous or necessary in the course of the synthesis to introduce functional groups which could lead to undesired reactions or side reactions in a synthesis step in the form of precursors which are later converted into the desired functional groups, or to temporarily block functional groups by a protective group strategy suited to the synthesis problem. Such strategies are well known to those skilled in the art (see, for example, Greene and Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1991). As examples of precursor groups nitro groups may be mentioned which can later be converted by reduction, for example by catalytic hydrogenation, into amino groups. Protecting groups (or blocking groups) that may be present on functional groups include allyl, tert-butyl, benzyl, tert-butyloxycarbonyl (Boc), benzyloxycarbonyi (Z) an' 9-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyi (Fmoc) as protecting groups for hydroxy, carboxylic<br><br>
acid, amino and guanidino groups.<br>
In particular, in the preparation of the compounds of the formula 1 building blocks can be connected by performing one or more condensation reaction such as amide couplings or ester formations, i. e. by forming amide bonds or ester bonds between a carboxylic acid group of one building block and an amino group or hydroxy group of another building block, or by establishing an ether linkage between a hydroxy group or a halogen atom of one building block and an hydroxy group of another building block. For example, compounds of the formula I can be prepared by linking the building blocks of the formulae IV, V, VI and VII<br><br>

by means of forming in a manner known per se an amide bond between the carboxylic acid derivative group CO-Z1 depicted in formula V and the NH2 group depicted in formula VI, by fonming in a manner known per se one or two ether linkages between building blocks of the formulae IV and V in which groups E and/or groups G are hydroxy groups, and by optionally forming in a manner known per se an amide bond or an ester bond between the carboxylic acid derivative group CO-Z1 and the amino or oxy group to which the hydrogen atom depicted in formula VII is bonded.<br>
In the compounds of fonmulae IV, V, VI and VII the groups A, L and R° and n and k are defined as above, but functional groups in these compounds can also be present in the form of precursor groups which are later converted into the groups present in<br><br>
the compounds of the formula I, or functional groups can be present in protected form. One or two of the groups Y in the compounds of the formula V are carbon atoms to which the groups G are bonded, zero, one, two or three of the groups Y are nitrogen atoms, and the remaining groups Y are carbon atoms carrying a group R\ where R' is defined as above but where functional groups in R1 can also be present in the form of precursor groups which are later converted into the groups present in the compounds of the formula I, or functional groups can be present in protected form. If compounds of the formula I are to be prepared in which one group of the formula II is present, the number g of the groups G that are present in the compounds of the formula V is one. if compounds of the formula I are to be prepared in which two groups of the formula II are present the number g is two. The groups G which can be identical or different, are hydroxy groups or nucleophilically substitutable leaving groups, for example halogen like fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine. The group E in the compounds of the formula IV just so is a hydroxy group or a nucleophilically substitutable leaving group, for example halogen like chlorine, bromine or iodine, or a sulfonyioxy group like tosyloxy, methylsulfonyloxy or trifluoromethylsulfonyloxy. At least one of the two groups E and G which are reacted to establish an ether linkage via which the group R°-(CH2)n is attached, has to be a hydroxy group. The groups f and 21 which can be identical or different, are hydroxy or nucleophilically substitutable leaving groups, i. e. the groups COZ1 and COZ1 in the compounds of the formulae V and VI are carboxylic acid groups CCJCJH or activated derivatives of carboxylic acids like acid chlorides, esters like (Ci-C4)-alkyl esters or activated esters, or mixed anhydrides.<br>
The starting compounds of the formulae IV, V, VI and VII and other compounds which are employed in the synthesis of the compounds of formula I for introducing certain structural units, are commercially available or can be readily prepared from commercially available compounds by or analogously to procedures described below or in the literature which is readily available to those skilled in the art.<br>
For the preparation of the compounds of formuia 1 first the compounds of the formulae IV and V may be linked and the resulting intermediate product then be<br><br>
condensed with a compound of the formula VI to give an intermediate product which is finally condensed with a compound of the formula Vil to give a compound of the formula I. Just so, first the compounds of the formulae VI and VII may be condensed and the resulting intermediate product then be condensed with a compound of the formula V to give an intermediate product which is finally linked to a compound of the formula IV to give a compound of the formula 1. The intermediate obtained from the compounds of the fonmula VI and VII may also be condensed with an intermediate obtained by condensing the compounds of the formulae IV and V. There are various other possibilities how the compounds of the formulae IV, V, VI and VII can be coupled to give compounds of the formula I. After any such reaction step in the course of such syntheses protecting and deprotecting steps and conversions of precursor groups into the desired final groups may be carried out and further modifications may made. For example, a group like R' that is different from hydrogen may already be present in the compound of formula V which is employed into the coupling reaction with the compound of formula VI or with the intermediate obtained from the compounds of formula VI and Vil, but such a group R' may also be introduced only after performing one coupling reaction or both coupling reactions. The synthetic strategy for the preparation of a compound of the formula I can thus be varied broadly, and it depends on the individual case which synthetic procedure is preferred.<br>
Various general methods for the formation of an amide bond that can be employed in the synthesis of the compounds of formula I are known to those skilled in the art, for example, from peptide chemistry. An amide coupling or ester coupling step can favorably be carried out by employing a free carboxylic acid, i. e. a compound of the formula V or VI or an intermediate coupling product in which a group like COZ1 or COZ1 reacting in that step is a COOH group, activating that carboxylic acid group, preferably in situ, by means of a customary coupling reagent such as a carbodiimide like dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) or diisopropyicarbodiimide (DIG), or a carbonyldiazole like carbonyldiimidazole, or a uronium salt like 0-((cyano-(ethoxycarbonyl)methy!ene)amino)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyiuronium tetrafluoroborate (TOTU) or 0-(7-a2abenzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyiuronium<br><br>
hexafluorophosphate (HATU), or a chlcroformic acid ester like ethyl chloroformate or isobutyl chloroformate, or tosyl chloride, or prcpylphosphonic acid anhydride, or others, and then reacting the activated carboxyiic acid derivativ? v/ith an amino compound or hydroxy compound of the formiula VI or VII. An amide bond can also be formed by reacting an amino compound with a carboxyiic acid halide, in particular a carboxyiic acid chloride, which can be prepared in a separate step or in situ from a carboxyiic acid and, for example, thionyl chloride, or an carboxyiic acid ester or thioester, for example a methyl ester, ethyl ester, phenyl ester, nitrophenyl ester, pentafluorophenyl ester, methylthio ester, phenylthio ester or pyridin-2-ylthio ester, i. e. with a compound of the formula V or VI or with a intermediate coupling product in which a group like Z1 or Z1 is chlorine, methoxy, ethoxy, optionally substituted phenyloxy, methylthio, phenylthio or pyridin-2-ylthio.<br>
The activation reactions and coupling reactions are usually performed in the presence of an inert solvent (or diluent), for example in the presence of an aprotic solvent like dimethylformamide (DMF), tetrahydrofuran (THF), dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), hexamethyl phosphoric triamide (HMPT), 1,2-dimethoxyethane (DME), dioxane, or others, or in a mixture of such solvents. Depending on the specific process, the reaction temperature may be varied over a wide range and be, for example, from about - 20 "C to the boiling temperature of the solvent or diluent. Also depending on the specific process, it may be necessary or advantageous-to add in a suitable amount one or more auxiliary agents, for example a base like a tertiary amine, such as triethylamine or diisopropylethylamine, or an alkali metal alcoholate, such as sodium methoxide or potassium tert-butoxide, for adjusting the pH or<br>
I   neutralizing an acid that is formed or for liberating the free base of an amino compound that is employed in the form of an acid addition salt, or an N-hydroxyazole like 1-hydroxybenzotriazole, or a catalyst like 4-dimethylaminopyridine. Details on methods for the preparation of activated carboxyiic acid derivatives and the formation of amide bonds and ester bonds as well as source literature are given in various<br>
)   standard references like, for example, J. March, Advanced Organic Chemistry, 4th ed., John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1992; or Houben-Weyl, Methoden der organischen Chemie [Methods of Organic Chemistry], Georg Thieme Verlag.<br><br>
The formation of the ether linkage between the building blocks of the formulae IV and V by condensation of the groups E and G can be performed by various methods which are known per se and which are familiar to those skilled in the art. If in a compound of the formula IV wherein n is different from zero, the group E is halogen, sulfonyloxy or another nudeophilically substitutabie leaving group, and the group G is hydroxy, the reaction is between a substituted alkyl halide etc. and an aromatic, i. e. phenolic, or a heteroaromatic hydroxy group, and corresponds to the well known Williamson reaction. If E is hydroxy and G is halogen or another nucleophilicaily substitutabie leaving group, the reaction is between an alcohol or phenol and an aryl or heteroaryl halide etc. and is an aromatic nucleophilic substitution. The latter reaction can be carried in case the aromatic ring in the compound of the formula V is activated by electron-withdrawing substituents like nitro or by ring nitrogen atoms. Details for performing these reactions, for example with regard to solvents or to the addition of bases, can be found in the above-mentioned references like J. March, loc. cit, and Houben-Weyl, loc. cit. A versatile method which can favorably be used to form the ether linkage is the condensation of compounds of the formulae IV and V wherein both E and G are hydroxy, under the conditions of the Mitsunobu reaction. In such a reaction a hydroxy compound is activated by reaction with an azodicarboxylic acid ester like diethyl azodicarboxyiate (DEAD) or diisopropyl azodicarboxylate (DIAD) and a phosphane (ike triphenylphosphane or tributylphosphane.'and becomes susceptible to nucleophilic substitution by, for example, a second hydroxy compound. The reaction can usually be carried under mild conditions in an aprotic solvent like an ether, for example tetrahydrofuran or dioxane, at temperatures from about 0" C to about room temperature. Details on the Mitsunobu reaction are given, for example, in 0. Mitsunobu, Synthesis (1981) 1 - 28, or in the examples below.<br>
Protective groups that may still be present in the products obtained in the above reactions are then removed by standard procedures. For example, tert-butyl protecting groups, in particular a tert-butyl ester group which is a protected form of a COOH group, can be deprotected, i. e. converted into the carboxyiic acid group in the case of an tert-butyl ester, by treatment with trifiuoroacetic acid. Benzyl groups can<br><br>
be removed by hydrogenation. Fluorenyimethoxycarbonyl groups can be removed by secondary amines like piperidine. As already explained, after the coupling reaction also functional groups can be generated from suitable precursor groups or, if desired, further reactions can be carried out on the coupling products by standard processes, for example acylation reactions or esterification reactions. In addition, a conversion into a physiologically tolerable salt or a prodrug of a compound of the formula I can then be carried out by known processes.<br>
The reactions described above and below that are carried out in the syntheses of the compounds of the formula I can generally be carried out according to the methods of conventional solution phase chemistry as well as according to the methods of solid phase chemistry which are well known, for example, from peptide synthesis. The compounds of the formula I can be prepared, for example, according to the methods of solid phase chemistry by a process which comprises<br>
a)	coupling a compound of the formula VI wherein Z1 is hydroxy and the amino group is protected by the Fmoc group and the L-substituted guanidino group is a protected guanidino group, to an acid sensitive linker attached to a resin or In general to a solic support, and cleaving off the protecting group Fmoc,<br>
b)	coupling a compound of the formula V wherein Z1 is hydroxy to the free amino group,<br>
c)	coupling a compound of the formula IV to the intermediate attached folhe resin bj reacting the groups E and G to give an ether linkage, for example coupling a compound of the formula IV in which E is hydroxy to the intermediate in which G is hydroxy under Mitsunobu conditions in the presence of an azodicarboxylate and triphenylphosphane, and<br>
d)	cleaving off the compound obtained according to steps a) through c) from the resi by means of trifluoroacetic acid.<br>
The resin or the linker used in this process may be of a type such that the carboxy group in the compound of the formula VI which is coupled to the resin or the linker, respectively, is transformed into an amide group C(=0)-NH2, for example a Knorr Linker or a Rink amide resin.<br><br>
In general, a reaction mixture containing a final compound of the formula I or an intermediate is worked up and, if desired, the product is then purified by customary processes known to those skilled in the art. For example, a synthesized compound can be purified using well known methods such as crystallization, chromatography or reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) or other methods of separation based, for example, on the size, charge or hydrophoblcity of the compound. Similarly, well known methods such as NMR, IR and mass spectrometry (MS) can be used for characterizing a compound of the invention.<br>
The compounds of the present invention are serine protease inhibitors which inhibit the activity of the blood coagulation enzymes factor Xa and/or factor Vila. In particular, they are highly active inhibitors of factor Xa. They are specific serine protease inhibitors inasmuch as they do not substantially inhibit the activity of other proteases involved in the blood coagulation and/or the fibrinolysis pathway whose inhibition is not desired, such as plasmin and thrombin, in particular thrombin (using the same concentration of the inhibitor). The activity of the compounds of the formula I can be detenmined, for example, in the assays described below or In other assays known to those skilled in the art. With respect to factor Xa inhibition, a preferred embodiment of the invention comprises compounds which have a Ki 1 1 \iM, particulariy preferably s 0.1 pM, for factor Xa inhibition as determined in ffie assay described below, with or without concomitant factor Vila inhibition, and which preferably do not substantially inhibit the activity of other proteases involved in coagulation and fibrinolysis whose inhibition is not desired (using the same concentration of the inhibitor). The compounds of the invention inhibit factor Xa catalytic activity either directly, within the prothrombinase complex or as a soluble subunit, or indirectly, by inhibiting the assembly of factor Xa into the prothrombinase complex. With respect to factor Vila inhibition, a preferred embodiment of the invention comprises compounds which have a Ki 
 <br>
proteases involved in coagulation and fibrinolysis whose inhibition is not desired (using the same concentration of the inhibitor).<br>
Because of their factor Xa and/or factor Vila inhibitory activity the compounds of the formula I are useful pharmacologically active compounds which are suitable, for example, for influencing blood coagulation (or blood clotting) and fibrinolysis and for the therapy and prophylaxis of, for example, cardiovascular disorders, thromboembolic diseases or restenoses. The compounds of the fomnula I and their physiologically tolerable salts and their prodrugs can be administered to animals, preferably to mammals, and in particular to humans as pharmaceuticals for therapy or prophylaxis. They can be administered on their own, or in mixtures with one another or in the form of pharmaceutical preparations which permit enteral or parenteral administration and which contain, as active constituent, an effective amount of at least one compound of the formula I and/or its physiologically tolerable salts and/or its prodrugs in addition to customary pharmaceutically acceptable carrier substances and/or additives.<br>
The present invention therefore also relates to the compounds of the formula 1 and/o their physiologically tolerable salts and/or their prodrugs for use as pharmaceuticals (or medicaments), to the use of the compounds of the formula I and/or their physiologically tolerable salts and/or their prodnjgs for the production of ~ pharmaceuticals for the inhibition of factor Xa and/or factor Vila or for influencing blood coagulation or fibrinolysis or for the therapy or prophylaxis of the diseases mentioned above or below, for example for the production of pharmaceuticals for th* therapy and prophylaxis of cardiovascular disorders, thromboembolic diseases or restenoses. The invention also relates to the use of the compounds of the formula I and/or their physiologically tolerable salts and/or their prodrugs for the inhibition of factor Xa and/or factor Vila or for influencing blood coagulation or fibrinolysis or for the therapy or prophylaxis of the diseases mentioned above or below, for example i use in the therapy and prophylaxis of cardiovascular disorders, thromboembolic diseases or restenoses, and to methods of treatment aiming at such purposes including methods for said therapies and prophylaxes. The present invention<br><br>
furthermore relates to pharmaceutica! preparations (or pharmaceutical compositions) which contain an effective amount of at least one compound of the formula I and/or its physiologically tolerable salts and/or its prodrugs in addition to a customary pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, i. e. one or more pharmaceuticaliy acceptable carrier substances or excipients and/or auxiliary substances or additives.<br>
The pharmaceuticals can be administered orally, for example in the form of pills, tablets, lacquered tablets, coated tablets, granules, hard and soft gelatin capsules, solutions, syrups, emulsions, suspensions or aerosol mixtures. Administration, however, can also be candied out rectally, for example In the fonm of suppositories, or parenteraJly, for example intravenously, intramuscularly or subcutaneously, in the form of injection solutions or infusion solutions, microcapsules, implants or rods, or percutaneously or topically, for example in the form of ointments, solutions or tinctures, or in other ways, for example in the form of aerosols or nasal sprays.<br>
The pharmaceutical preparations according to the invention are prepared in a manner known per se and familiar to one skilled in the art, pharmaceutically acceptable inert inorganic and/or organic caniers being used in addition to the compound{s) of the fonmula I and/or its (their) physiologically tolerable salts and/or its (their) prodrugs. For the production of pills, tablets, coated tablets and hard gelatin capsules it is possible to use, for example, lactose, com starch or derivatives thereof, talc, stearic acid or its salts, etc. Canrier substances'for soft gelatin capsules and suppositories are, for example, fats, waxes, semisolid and liquid polyols, natural or hardened oils, etc. Suitable carrier substances for the production of solutions, for example injection solutions, or of emulsions or syrups are, for example, water, saline, alcohols, glycerol, polyols, sucrose, invert sugar, glucose, vegetable oils, etc. Suitable carrier substances for microcapsules, implants or rods are, for example, copolymers of glycolic acid and lactic acid. The pharmaceutical preparations normally contain about 0.5 to about 90 % by weight of the compounds of the formula I and/or their physiologically tolerable salts and/or their prodrugs. The amount of the active ingredient of the formula I and/or its physiologically tolerable salts and/or its prodrugs in the pharmaceutical preparations normally is from about 0.5 to about 1000 mg,<br><br>
preferably from about 1 to about 500 mg.<br>
In addition to the active ingredients of the formula I and/or their physioiogicaliy<br>
acceptable salts and/or prodrugs and to carrier substances, the pharmaceutical<br>
preparations can contain additives such as, for example, fillers, disintegrants,<br>
binders, lubricants, wetting agents, stabilizers, emulsifiers, preservatives,<br>
sweeteners, colorants, flavorings, aromatizers, thickeners, diluents, buffer<br>
substances, solvents, solubilizers, agents for achieving a depot effect, salts for<br>
altering the osmotic pressure, coating agents or antioxidants. They can also contain<br>
two or more compounds of the formula I and/or their physiologically tolerable salts<br>
and/or their prodrugs. In case a pharmaceutical preparation contains two or more<br>
compounds of the formula I the selection of the individual compounds can aim at a<br>
specific overall pharmacological profile of the pharmaceutical preparation. For<br>
example, a highly potent compound with a shorter duration of action may be<br>
combined with a long-acting compound of lower potency. The flexibility permitted with<br>
respect to the choice of substituents in the compounds of the formula I allows a greal<br>
deal of cc   '"ol over the biological and physico-chemical properties of the compounds<br>
and thus allows the selection of such desired compounds. Furthermore, in addition tc<br>
at least one compound of the formula I and/or its physiologically tolerable salts and/o<br>
its prodnjgs, the pharmaceutical preparations can also contain one or more other<br>
therapeutically or prophylactically active ingredients.	" ~<br>
As inhibitors of factor Xa and/or factor Vila the compounds of the foi1ula I and their physiologically tolerable salts and their prodrugs are generally suitable for the therapy and prophylaxis of conditions in which the activity of factor Xa and/or factor Vila plays a role or has an undesired extent, or which can favorably be influenced b; inhibiting factor Xa and/or factor Vila or decreasing their activities, or for the prevention, alleviation or cure of which an inhibition of factor Xa and/or factor Vila oi a decrease in their activity is desired by the physician. As inhibition of factor Xa and/or factor Vila influences blood coagulation and fibrinolysis, the compounds of tf-formula 1 and their physiologically tolerable salts and their prodrugs are generally suitable for reducing blood clotting, or for the therapy and prophylaxis of conditions<br><br>
which the activity of the blood coagulation system plays a role or has an undesired extent, or which can favorably be influenced by reducing blood clotting, or for the prevention, alleviation or cure of which a decreased activity of the blood coagulation system is desired by the physician. A specific subject of the present invention thus are the reduction or inhibition of unwanted blood clotting, in particular in an individual, by administering an effective amount of a compound I or a physiologically tolerable salt or a prodrug thereof, as well as pharmaceutical preparations therefor.<br>
Conditions in which a compound of the formula I can be favorably used include, for example, cardiovascular disorders, thromboembolic diseases or complications associated, for example, with infection or surgery. The compounds of the present invention can also be used to reduce an inflammatory response. Examples of specific disorders for the treatment or prophylaxis of which the compounds of the formula I can be used are coronary heart disease, myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, vascular restenosis, for example restenosis following angioplasty like PTCA, adult respiratory disstress syndrome, multi-organ failure, stroke and disseminated intravascular clotting disorder. Examples of related complications associated with surgery are thromboses like deep vein and proximal vein thrombosis which can occur following surgery. In view of their pharmacological activity the compounds of the invention can replace or supplement other anticoagulant agents such as heparin. The use of a compound of the invention can result, for example, in a cost sa'vlhg as compared to other anticoagulants.<br>
When using the compounds of the formula I the dose can vary within wide limits and, as is customary and is known to the physician, is to be suited to the individual conditions in each individual case. It depends, for example, on the specific compounc employed, on the nature and severity of the disease to be treated, on the mode and the schedule of administration, or on whether an acute or chronic condition is treated or whether prophylaxis is carried out. An appropriate dosage can be established using clinical approaches well known in the medical art. In general, the daily dose for achieving the desired results in an adult weighing about 75 kg is from about 0.01 to about 100 mg/kg, preferably from about 0.1 to about 50 mg/kg, in particular from<br><br>
about 0.1 to about 10 mg/kg, (in each case in mg per kg of body weight). The daily dose can be divided, in particular in the case of the administration of relatively large amounts, into several, for example 2, 3 or 4, part administrations. As usual, depending on individual behavior it may be necessary to deviate upwards or downwards from the daily dose indicated.<br>
A compound of the formula I can also advantageously be used as an anticoagulant outside an individual. For example, an effective amount of a compound of the invention can be contacted with a freshly drawn blood sample to prevent coagulation of the blood sample. Further, a compound of the formula I and its salts can be used for diagnostic purposes, for example in in vitro diagnoses, and as an auxiliary in biochemical investigations. For example, a compound of the formula I can be used in an assay to identify the presence of factor Xa and/or factor Vila or to isolate factor Xa and/or factor Vila in a substantially purified form. A compound of the invention can be labeled with, for example, a radioisotope, and the labeled compound bound to factor Xa and/or factor Vila is then detected using a routine method useful for detecting the particular label. Thus, a compound of the formula 1 or a salt thereof can be used advantageously as a probe to detect the location or amount of factor Xa and/or factor Vila activity in vivo, in vitro or ex vivo.<br>
Furthermore, the compounds of the formula I can be used as synthesis'intermediates for the preparation of other compounds, in particular of other pharmaceutical active ingredients, which are obtainable from the compounds of the formula I, for example by introduction of substltuents or modification of functional groups.<br>

Pharmacological testing<br>
The ability of the compounds of the formula I to inhibit factor Xa or factor Vila or other enzymes like thrombin, plasmin, or trypsin can be assessed by determining the concentration of the compound of the formula I that inhibits enzyme activity by 50 %, i. e. the ICso value, which is related to the inhibition constant Ki. Purified enzymes are used in chromogenic assays. The concentration of inhibitor that causes a 50 % decrease in the rate of substrate hydrolysis is determined by linear regression after plotting the relative rates of hydrolysis (compared to the uninhibited control) versus the log of the concentration of the compound of formula I. For calculating the inhibition constant Ki, the IC50 value is corrected for competition with substrate using the formula<br>
Ki = IC50 / {1 + (substrate concentration / Km)}<br><br>
wherein Km is the Michaelis-Menten constant (Chen and Prusoff, Biochem. Pharmacol. 22 (1973), 3099-3108; i. H. Segal, Enzyme Kinetics, 1975, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, 100-125; which are incorporated herein by reference).<br>
a)	Factor Xa Assay<br>
in the assay for determining the inhibition of factor Xa activity TBS-PEG buffer (50 mM Tris-CI, pH 7.8, 200 mM NaCi, 0.05 % (w/v) PEG-8000, 0.02 % (w/v) NaNa) was used. The ICso was determined by combining in appropriate wells of a Costar half-area microtiter plate 25 pi human factor Xa (Enzyme Research Laboratories, Inc.; South Bend, Indiana) in TBS-PEG; 40 pi 10 % (v/v) DMSO in TBS-PEG (uninhibited control) or various concentrations of the compound to be tested diluted in 10 % (v/v) DMSO in TBS-PEG; and substrate S-2765 (N(a)-benzyloxycarbonyl-D-Arg-Gly-L-Arg-p-nitroanilide; Kabi Pharmacia, Inc.; Franklin, Ohio) in TBS-PEG.<br>
The assay was performed by pre-incubating the compound of formula I plus enzyme for 10 min. Then the assay was initiated by adding substrate to obtain a final volume of 100 [j|. The initial velocity of chromogenic substrate hydrolysis was measured by the change in absorbance at 405 nm using a Bio-tek Instruments kinetic plate reader (Ceres UV900HDi) at 25 "C during the linear portion of the time course (usually 1.5 min after addition of substrate). The enzyme concentration was 0.5 nM and substrate concentration was 140 pM.<br>
b)	Factor Vila Assay<br>
The inhibitory activity towards factor Vila/tissue factor activity was determined using a chromogenic assay essentially as described in J. A. Ostrem et al., Biochemistry 37 (1998) 1053-1059, which is incorporated herein by reference. Kinetic assays were conducted at 25 'C in half-area microtiter plates (Costar Corp., Cambridge, Massachusetts) using a kinetic plate reader (Molecular Devices Spectramax 250). A typical assay consisted of 25 pi human factor Vila and TF (5 nM and 10 nM, respective final concentration) combined with 40 pi of inhibitor dilutions in 10% DMSOfTBS-PEG buffer (50 mM Tris, 15 mM NaCI, 5 mM CaCb, 0,05 % PEG 8000, pH 8.15). Following a 15 minute preincubation period, the assay was initiated by the<br><br>
addition of 35 1il of the chromogenic substrate S-2288 (D-lle-Pro-Arg-p-nitroanilide, Pharmacia Hepar Inc., 500 pM final concentration).<br>
The following test results (inhibition constants Ki (FXa) for inhibition of factor Xa and Ki (FVIIa) for inhibition of factor Vila) were obtained.<br><br>
Example Compound	Ki (FXa)	Ki (FVIIa)<br>
	(MM)	(MM)<br>
Example 1	0.048	188<br>
Example 2	0.076	<br>

Example 5	0.018	58<br>
Example 6	0.038	7.5<br>
Example 8	1.1	<br>
Example 11	0.192	<br>
Example 16	6.15	<br>
Example 32	13	13<br>
Example 34	0.75	9.8<br>
Example 39	0.445	&gt;200<br>
Example 45	0.031	&gt;200<br>
Example 46	0.059	&gt;200<br>
Example 47	0.021	&gt;200<br>
Example 48	0.56	&gt;200<br>
Example 50	0.729	&gt;200<br>
The following tests can serve to investigate the inhibition of selected other coagulation enzymes and other serine proteases by the compounds of formula I and thus to determine their specificity.<br><br>
c)	Thrombin Assay<br>
TBS-PEG buffer is used for this assay. The IC50 is determined as above for the factor Xa assay, except that the substrate is S-2356 (L-PyroGIu-L-Pro-L-Arg-p-nitroaniiide; Kabi) and the enzyme is human thrombin (Enzyme Research Laboratories, Inc.; South Bend, Indiana). The enzyme concentration is 175 pM.<br>
d)	Plasmin Assay<br>
TBS-PEG buffer is used for this assay. The IC50 is determined as described above for the factor Xa assay, except that the substrate is S-2251 (D-Val-L-Leu-L-Lys-p-nitroanilide; Kabi) and the enzyme is human plasmin (Kabi). The enzyme concentration is 5 nM and the substrate concentration is 300 |JM.<br>
e)	Trypsin Assay<br>
TBS-PEG buffer containing 10 mM CaCb is used for this assay. The ICso is determined as described above in the factor Xa assay, except that the substrate is BAPNA (benzoyl-L-Arg-p-nitroanilide; Sigma Chemical Co.; St. Louis, Missouri) and the enzyme is bovine pancreatic trypsin (Type XIII, TPCK treated; Sigma). The enzyme concentration is 50 nM and the substrate concentration is 300 \M.<br>
Rat Arteriovenous Shunt Model of Thrombosis<br>
The antithrombotic efficacy of the compounds of the invention can be assessed using rat extracorporeal arteriovenous (AV) shunt. The AV shunt circuit consists of a 20 cm length of polyethylene (PE) 60 tubing inserted into the right carotid artery, a 6 cm length of PE 160 tubing containing a 6.5 cm length of mercerized cotton thread (5 err exposed to blood flow), and a second length of PE 60 tubing (20 cm) completing the circuit into the left jugular vein. The entire circuit is filled with norma! saline prior to insertion.<br>
The test compound is administered by continuous infusion into the tail vein using a syringe pump and butterfly cathete"-. The compound is administered for 30 min, then the shunt is opened and blood allowed to flow for a period of 15 min (total of 45 min<br><br>
infusion). At the end of the 15 min period, the shunt is clamped and the thread is carefully removed and weighed on an analytical balance. Percent inhibition of thrombus formation is calculated using the thrombus weight obtained from control rats, which are infused with saline.<br><br><br><br>
