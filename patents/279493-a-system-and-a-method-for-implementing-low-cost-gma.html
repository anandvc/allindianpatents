DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
[010] A display system that receives input image data specified in three primary colors converts the input image data into an image data set of four primary colors. The display system comprises a module for determining a color value of a first primary color in the set of four primary colors, and a module for determining the value of the remaining three primary colors using the value of the first primary color. The remaining primary color values are determined by computing a solution to simultaneous equations based upon the color value of the first primary color.<br>
[011] A method for converting RGB input image data into an RGBW image data set for rendering on a display includes calculating a value for W image data based upon the RGB input image data, deriving an allowable value for W based upon a chromaticity specification<br>
for the display, and calculating output values for R, G and B input image data based upon the allowable W value.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[020] Systems and methods for implementing gamut mapping conversions (referred to herein as "GMA") from one color space to another (e.g. from RGB to RGBW) are known in the art. For example, the '562 application, incorporated here by reference, describes several such implementation methodologies. It is desirable to implement unproved GMAs that either extend the color mapping or reduce display implementation costs, or both. Several embodiments of providing GMA will now be given. Some of these embodiments involve more computation, while others comprise calculations that may be easier and less costly to implement but may also provide acceptable results to the user.<br>
[021] As described in several of the GMA related applications incorporated above, a first step in performing RGB-to-RGBW GMA might be to find a 4x3 matrix that can convert from RGBW to CIE XYZ, based on colorimeter readings of the display primaries. Matrix 1 below<br>
is merely one example. Matrix 1 can be combined with the inverse of a standard matrix that converts CIE XYZ to RGB (see Matrix 2 below) resulting in a combined matrix that maps directly from RGBW to RGB, shown as Matrix 3 below.<br>
 <br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
 [022] Matrix 1 was generated from measured data on a small LCD display. The measured primaries were not quite identical to the sRGB/NTSC standard primaries. The measured white point was somewhat yellowish, and distinguishable from the D65 standard. It should be appreciated and understood that, with each new model of display, the measurements could be taken to develop a new Matrix 1. Since similar displays with similar characteristics are likely to behave similarly, it may not be necessary to make such measurements for each new display.<br>
[023] Matrix 1, or conversion matrices derived from it, and in combination with the standard OIE XYZ to RGB matrix (e.g. Matrix 2), can be used to do color correction for the display while converting RGB to RGBW. The combination of Matrix 1 and the inverse of Matrix 2 results in a conversion matrix, Matrix 3, that converts RGBW to RGB. The values of Matrix 3 as derived from Matrices 1 and 2 above, are shown below.<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
 [024] Matrix 2 above converts display colors to source colors which is very useful for testing but it may be desired to have the inverse formula for converting source RGB colors (or other input sources such as YCbCr) to RGBW. When this matrix is used in an equation for RGB given RwGwBwW, the equation looks like it cannot be inverted:<br>
 <br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
 [025] It should be appreciated that Matrix 3 may be derived in any number of ways different from shown above. For example, Matrix 1 may be derived either by measurement or by calculation or modeling of the display. Once Matrix 3 is derived, however, one way to derive a way to make (or approximate) an invertible process or system is to make a simplifying assumption: Because there are common primary colors (e.g., red, green and blue) in both systems, it may be possible to choose some arbitrary value for W and then solve the above equations for the Rw Gw and BW values. In one embodiment, W is defined as a constant instead of a variable; this reduces the number of variables from 4 to 3, making this a system of three equations and three unknowns. Subtracting the W terms from both sides makes this an equation that can be solved with matrix algebra.<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
After simplification the result is a set of three equations for Rw Gw and BW:<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
 [026] Given Equation 3 and a source color in RGB space, it may then be possible to assign an arbitrary W value and then calculate the RwGwBw values that will produce a desired or suitable color. For some values of W, these RwGwBw values will be out of range, and this indicates that the desired color may not be "reached" with those values of W. It may be desirable to know the range on W given the desired RGB color. For example, if it is known that the range on Rw, Gw and Bw is between 0 and 1, then it is possible to calculate the minimum and maximum possible values of W by writing the previous equation as an inequality:<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
 [027] When W is solved for in Equation 4 above, a possible result may be:<br>
 <br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
Equation 5<br>
[028] It may also be desirable to have W be smaller than the minimum of the three values calculated on the left side and larger than the maximum of the three calculated values on the right Within these limits, there are many ways to "arbitrarily" choose a value for W. A minimum possible or maximum possible value may be calculated from Equation 5. Also, W could be set to the luminosity of the desired color and then clamped to the range from Equation 5. There may also be a minimum or a maximum W value different from the 0 to 1 range. As a further embodiment, the average of die minimum and maximum possible values could be used. Other embodiments may include other linear combinations of the range (besides the average) as possibly suitable choices. Once a value for W has been chosen (in whatever way possible or desirable), it may be combined with the desired RGB color in Equation 4 to generate the RwGwBwW values for the display.<br>
[029] The various procedures outlined with the above examples may work with measured or modeled data from any RGBW display. It may also work with any other multi-primary display that has 4 primaries, such as an RGBC (red green blue and cyan) wide gamut display. There are, however, some special cases that can make the equations work out in ways that are easier, and thus less expensive, to manufacture in hardware. One simplification that is often made is to assume that the primaries of the display are exactly equal to the primaries from the source data, usually sRGB. When this is done, the combined RGBW to RGB matrix may exhibit zeros off the diagonal on the first three columns, like this example below:<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
 [030] If Matrix 4 is compared to Matrix 3, it may be seen that where Matrix 4 has a zero, Matrix 3 has a reasonably small number. This lends support to the idea that this may be a<br>
reasonable approximation for a well designed display. If Matrix 4 is used to perform the steps shown in Equations 1 through 5, the results are the following equations:<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
 [031] Equation 7 shows one set of possible limits on the W value, and Equation 6 shows how to calculate Rw Gw and Bw given a desired RGB color and an arbitrarily chosen W value. It should be appreciated that the measured data for the previous example had a different white point than the input data and thus Equations 6 and 7 may do white point corrections as they convert from source colors to RGBW.<br>
[032] In yet another embodiment, there is another simplification that makes the hardware even less expensive to manufacture. If the display is assumed to have a white point identical to the source data, and the luminosities of the display primaries match the source, then the conversion becomes even simpler. This assumption is often reasonable if color fidelity may be relaxed as a feature of the display. This may be desirable in that the brightest color in the source data, RGB-(l,l,l), may map substantially to the brightest color in the RGBW display with RGBW=(1,1,1,1). When the measured values from the display are replaced with the standard chromaticity values, the RGBW to RGB matrix becomes:<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
 [033] It is noticed that this Matrix 5 has only two different coefficients in it It should also be noticed that these coefficients may be reduced to only one coefficient by observing that the two coefficients sum to one. Thus 0.238154 can be replaced with (1-0.761846). When Matrix 5 is used to perform the steps shown in Equations 1 through 5, the results are the following equations:<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
[034] In yet another embodiment, an additional optimization may be achieved in that the maximum and minimum of R G and B may be taken before the other calculations. This may be desirable as this will reduce the number of multiplies from 6 to only 2.<br>
[035] For merely one example of a display system, FIG. 7 shows one possible subpixel layout for a display used in a display system. This layout comprises a repeating group of subpixels 700 with red 702 and blue 704 on a checkerboard and green 706 and white (or possibly some other color, like yellow) 708 on a second checkerboard. With this layout, there is an additional optimization that is possible. In this layout the luminance of the W sub-pixels is approximately equal to the luminance of all the color sub-pixels put together. In this case the RGBW to RGB matrix that results is particularly well suited for low-cost implementations. When the luminosity of W is assumed to be substantially equal to the sum of the other primaries (e.g. white or grey or wideband yellow), then Matrix 6 may be approximately as follows:<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
 [036] In this case, all the coefficients may be equated to O.S which are particularly convenient to implement in hardware. Of course, not all layouts may have results this simple, so Matrix 5 will be used as the example for most of the following discussion.<br>
[037] A typical assumption in some above embodiments is that both the RGBW and RGB color-spaces are mapped to a unit cube (or hypercube in the case of RGBW). This normalizing of the two color-spaces may not be absolutely correct, since the RGBW space can display brighter colors than the RGB. However, normalizing the spaces like this is a type of automatic gamut conversion, mapping the brightest RGB colors to the brightest RGBW colors. This gamut expansion may result in a brighter image. For each input color, the following procedure is followed:<br>
(1)     The input RGB color may be assumed to map to a larger output space and may be used as the desired output color.<br>
(2)	A W value is selected by arbitrarily starting from the luminance of the input<br>
color (for example) and then clamping it to the limits of Equation 9 (for<br>
example).<br>
(3)	Given the desired RGB values and the selected W value, the RwGwBw values<br>
are calculated using Equation 8 (for example).<br>
Gamut clamping, which is described below, may also be required.<br>
[038] The following discussion of FIGS. 1 and 2 supplies a graphical intuition which may help communicate an understanding of the meaning of the above equations. Given a desired RGB color, it is possible to perform Equation 6 calculations for all possible W values between 0 and 1 and plot the resulting RwGwBw values. For a single RGB color, this may describe roughly a diagonal line in output RGB space. FIG. 1 is a plot of the resulting diagonal lines for three different RGB colors.<br>
[039] Because this is a plot of a slice from input RGB space, an adjustment may be made to plot RGBW values on it. The RwGwBw values may be scaled so that they indicate their maximum range of effect in RGB space. In this graph, it may not be desirable that scaled Rw and Gw values are outside the dotted square 106. The length of the diagonal Ikes indicates the maximum effect of W in the output RGB. The circles at the upper ends of the diagonal lines indicate a possibly desired color. As W ranges from 0 (the upper right end of each line) to I (the lower left end) the line carves out Rw and Gw values that result from Equations 6.<br>
[040] Looking at the diagonal Ike 102A in FIG. 1, it is apparent that some of the points on the Ike allows that some of the Rw and Gw points lie outside the dotted lines. The minimum projected length of W k the RGBW space may be long enough to prevent Rw and Gw values from getting too large. The right side of Equation 7 may provide that this may not happen. Looking at the diagonal line 102B in FIG. 1, it is apparent that W may be as long as possible to "reach" the desired color. The diagonal Ike 104C would allow W to have any value between 0 and 1 and still produce valid RwGwBw values in Equation 6.<br>
[041] FIG. 2 shows two more examples of possible W values for given output RGB values. Looking at the diagonal line 204A, some values of W result k negative RwGwBw values. The left side of Equation 7 tends to prevent mis.<br>
[042] It should be noted that there are cases where all possible values of W may result k out-of-range values of RwGwBw. The rightmost diagonal line 204B k FIG. 2 shows one example<br>
of this. In this case, it may be desirable to limit \V to just the left side of Equation 7. This tends to prevent RwGwBw values from going negative as in the bottom section 202B of line 204B. They may still go positive out-of-bounds and this may be corrected by gamut clamping (as described below).<br>
[043] These RGB, RwGwBw and W values supplied or calculated in the above discussion may take on the range 0-1 but in an another embodiment, it may be desirable to have this replaced by an integer range, typically from 0 to 255. In hardware, a number of simplifying calculations may be made. For example, a division by 0.238154 can be replaced by a multiplication by 1/0.238154 or 4.198964. Also in hardware, this multiplication could be approximated by the integer operation of multiplying by 1074/256 or multiplying by 1074 and dropping the lower 8 bits of the result. The division by 0.761846 can be replaced by multiplying by 1/0.761846 or approximately 1.312601. m a hardware version this multiply can be further approximated by multiplying by 336 and dropping the lower 8 bits of the result. After a conversion to integer arithmetic and with an appropriate choice from Equations 5, it is possible to convert RGB to RGBW in as few as 4 multiplies, plus various operations like addition, comparing and shilling that are computationally much less expensive than multiplication. This will make implementation in hardware less expensive than other techniques while still producing correct colors.<br>
[044] As noted, there is a small class of colors that result in out-of-range RwGJBw values when converted from RGB to RGBW. Diagonal line 204b in FIG. 2 shows an example of this. The circle at the upper right of this line is the desired color in RGB space. The diagonal line shows all the possible RwGwBw values that may produce that color. Some of them have negative Gw values and should not be used, and the rest have Rw values that map to positions greater than the limit (e.g. at 0. 761846). As mentioned above, a choice may be made in Equations 3 and 4 to limit the Min WP and Max WP values so that the RwGwBw values are zero or positive, hi the case of diagonal line 204b, the result may be an Rw value mat is too large. In other areas of the color-space, the other primaries -- or pairs of them - may go out of range and become too large. The result may be out-of-gamut colors and these must be brought back into gamut in a way that does not produce visible defects in the image.<br>
[045] Several embodiments of methods and systems that bring colors back into gamut have been discussed in many above incorporated applications. One embodiment involves "gamut clamping" - where colors that lie outside the gamut are scaled until the color lies on the edge<br>
of the gamut This may be accomplished by scaling all (he primary values of a color by the same amount so that the hue of a color may not change as it is brought back into gamut. Another embodiment involves "gamut scaling". In this embodiment, colors going to the display are scaled so extra multipliers may be employed in a hardware version. Because many of the colors lie in volumes where the range of both color-spaces may have approximately the same range, gamut scaling may result in scaling the primary values by approximately 1, which has little or no effect. Mainly in colors, like the line 204b in FIG. 2, will the gamut scaling algorithm scale the colors down. As the colors approach the in-gamui areas from the outside, the scaling factor may approach 1, so there will be no sudden change in colors at the border.<br>
[046] The following detail some low cost embodiments that implement the novel techniques described above and herein.<br>
[047] to one embodiment, the numbers may not need to be based on measurements of the chromaticity and luminosity values of a given display as manufactured. With these values, the brightest white on input (255,255,255) would be correctly color converted to the desired white-point output, which may not result in the brightest color (255,255,255,255) on output. One embodiment may take as given mat the primaries are close to sRGB and their white-point is close to D65. Colors may not be absolutely correct but may be approximately correct and "bright" may map to "bright". One possible advantage may be that it decreases the total number of multipliers in the hardware design. Additionally, the numbers may not have to change if this design is used on different displays with different primary chromau'cities.<br>
[048] FIG. 3 shows an high level block diagram 300 of embodiment of a RGB to RGBW converter. For the sake of example, input 302 may take 8 bits each for R,G, and B for input, 12 bite for the linear data after gamma processing 304, and 8 bits output to the display 318. Of course, other systems may employ other numbers. Additionally, since this may not be the final configuration, the original floating point source values may be included for all the constants so they can be converted for different bit depths, Additionally, it will be appreciated that the present invention is applicable in general to systems that take in three color primary unage data and convert to four color primary image data. For example, such a system could accept as input: RGB stripe data, YCbCr, data, sRGB data, and YUV data and any other<br>
suitable three color data. Such a system could output a plurality of four color data, including, but not limited to: RGBW, RGBY, RGBC, RGBM, RGCM or the like.<br>
Input Gamma LUT<br>
[049] One embodiment of input gamma 304 would be to use an sRGB input gamma curve. Most files on PC computers are built with this gamma assumption, and most images on cellphones may employ this assumption. However, it is possible to reduce gamma pipeline errors by building the input gamma curve from the output, or building both together from the same source data. Thus, other embodiments may change the exact input gamma LUT used, based on the final display configuration.<br>
Luminance based W Calculation<br>
[050] Block 306 for calculating the W value may take on several embodiments - based the set of following Equations 10:<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
 [051] Line 1 above calculates Luminosity (L) using an approximation mat can be done in hardware with shifts and adds. This L value is used here and also saved for later use in the Sub-Pixel-Rendering (SPR) module. Of course, other equations approximating L could be used - some involving more computation.<br>
[052] line 2 sets WS (W scaled) to a value it would have if based entirely on luminance where MI may be a constant, approximately equal to 0.503384. This may be approximated by dividing by two - but may also be accomplished by multiplying by 129 and right shifting the result 8 times. In some instances, the WS value may be out of range and may be processed accordingly, including being clamped in the following lines. Ws may be employed as an intermediate value that may be saved to reduce multiplies when calculating RwGwBw in later steps.<br>
[053] Line 3 clamps the Wg value to a minimum value it is allowed to have and still keep the final Rw, Gw, and BW values in range. The minimum Ws value approximates the maximum of the RGB input values after subtracting a value, M0. In one embodiment, MO may be a constant (approximately equal to 0.496616) and may additionally be scaled to the range of the gamut pipeline. In the case of an embodiment employing a 12 bit pipeline, Mo may be multiplied by 212-1 or 4095 and the value subtracted would be 2034 (rounded up for safety). Of course, it is to be appreciated that other values for the various constants would be used according to the particular design of the system (e.g. 12 bits versus some other bit value for the pipeline - other system parameters may also effect the choice of values). It should also be noted that this formula might vary if the system is concerned with color fidelity and not converting bright colors to bright colors. For convenience, Table 1 depicts different embodiments with the decimal value calculated for different bit sizes of the gamma pipeline.<br>
<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
 [054] Line 4 tends to prevent Ws from going negative when the input RGB values are out of gamut in the RGBW system. If the result would go negative, the value zero may be substituted instead.<br>
[055] Line 5 tends to limit the Ws value to a maximum allowed and still keep the<br>
values in range. It also tends to prevent negative values when the source RGB value is outside<br>
the RGBW gamut Positive out-of-gamut values may be easier to detect and clamp.<br>
[056] Finally, line 6 of Equations 10 calculates a final W value. M1 is employed and which approximately equals 0.503384. This can alternatively be accomplished by multiplying by I/M1 which would be 1.986555. Although this is almost multiplying by two, it could be better approximated by multiplying1/M1 by 256, (rounding down for safety in this case) resulting in 508. Now Ws can be multiplied by 508 and then right shifted 8 bits to accomplish the divide by MI . FIG. 4 is a high level block diagram of one embodiment of block 306. It will again be appreciated that other values may be employed, depending upon the design constraints and considerations of the system. It will be appreciated that the numeric values for multiply and<br>
shift (e.g. 124 and 8 respectively) in FIG. 4 may vary according to the particular values of MO and M1.<br>
Calculate RwGwBw<br>
[057] One embodiment of a set of formulae for calculating the RwGwBw value is seen in Equations 11:<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
 [058] However, M1*W is the intermediate value Ws mat may be saved from the previous step (and as seen in embodiment in FIG. 4), so the extra multiplies may not be required here. Dividing by Mo is substantially the same as multiplying by 2.013628. This is almost multiplying by two, and to retain more accuracy, it may be performed by multiplying by 515 and right shifting 8 times. However, doing this may result in an overflow of more than one bit(s) as discussed below and the multiplier may be to be lowered from 515 to prevent this. The value of 512 is one possible value (and possibly one of the largest values) that may not result in a two-bit-overflow. This is similar to multiplying by 2 (or left shifting) once. This optimization may work with both a 10bit and a 12bit internal gamma pipeline. With other pipeline sizes, the multiplier may need to be re-calculated FIG. 5 depicts merely one possible embodiment of the above processing - other implementations with other values as intimated above are, of course, suitable for purposes of the present invention.<br>
[059] These multiplies are expected to often overflow by one bit. In the case of a 12 bit gamma pipeline this means that the result must be allowed to be 13 bits large. This extra bit cannot be discarded or clamped, as out-of-gamut colors are allowed. The 13th bit of precision must be preserved in mis multiply for the gamut clamping in the next step.<br>
Gamut Clamping<br>
[060] When black and white are mapped to the same or similar colors in RGB and RGBW, the total gamut 'Volume" of RGBW turns out to be slightly smaller than RGB of equal brightness. This means that mere may be some colors, especially bright saturated colors, that exist in the expanded RGB but may not be displayed in RGBW. When these colors arrive, something reasonable may be done. Simply clamping the RGBW values to the maximum range may result in the hue of these colors being distorted. Instead, the out-of-gamut colors<br>
may be detected and scaled in a way that preserves hue while bringing them back into range. FIG. 6 depicts merely one possible embodiment of the gamut clamping disclosed herein.<br>
Detecting In-Gamut<br>
[061] The multipliers in the previous step may be designed to return values larger than their input values. This may allow out-of-gamut (O.O.G.) values to be calculated. These values may not be more than twice the range of the input values, so one more bit in the output may allow values to "overflow". If this extra overflow bit is zero in all three of the R G and B results, then the color is in gamut and it could be gated around the rest of the gamut clamping path. FIG. 6 shows the upper bit (bit 12) of all three converted primaries OR'ed together to produce the O.O.G. signal<br>
Out-Of-Gamut Response<br>
[062] If the overflow bit in any one of the R, G, and B results is ON, this indicates that an out-of-gamut color may have resulted and all four of the primaries may be scaled by a substantially same factor. Scaling all four components by a substantially same factor decreases luminosity but preserves hue. This scale factor may be a number slightly less than one, so it may be a fixed point binary fraction.<br>
Maximum Component<br>
[063] The ratio of distance to the edge of the gamut relative to the out-of-gamut distance is one suitable calculation of the gamut scaling factor to bring out-of-gamut values back in range. Unfortunately, this may require calculating two square roots. Fortunately, the ratio of the width of the color-space relative to the maximum component of the out-of-gamut color gives a suitable result as well. The width of the color-space is a power of two (2n for the case of 12 bit linear RGB values) and becomes a bit shift. Thus, the maximum component of the out-of-gamut color is easy to select. The result of the maximum comparison while calculating W may be saved and used at this point to avoid extra gates here.<br>
Inverse LUT<br>
[064] The maximum out-of-gamut component may be inverted by looking it up in an inverse LUT. Occasionally, values do approach 213, so a table of the upper half of an inverse curve may be desirable as one possible embodiment. The table could be designed to accept the<br>
lower 12 bits of the out-of-gamut number and return an 8 bit fixed-point binary number. The formula for this LUT is for x=0 to 4095, INV(x)=floor((256*4096)/(x+4096+l)). An inverse table may introduce errors, but the upper half of the 1/x table is not where the errors typically occur, so this may safely be done here.<br>
Clamping Multipliers<br>
[065] The Inverse LUT can be calculated to have 8 bit values in it, so three 13x8=12 multipliers will be necessary to scale out-of-gamut values back down into range. The actual function done by the multipliers is (A*B)/256 where A is the 13 bit out-of-gamut value and B is the inverse number from the LUT. The output of the multipliers need only be 12 bits because the inverse numbers are all fixed point binary numbers between 0.5 and 1. Storing these inverse values as 8 bit numbers results in clamped values that are slightly less than the expected number. However, the error is always smaller than 1% and it is always too small, guaranteeing that the clamped numbers are back in range to fit in a 12 bit result.<br>
[066] When the color is out of gamut then all the R, G, B, and W components are multiplied by the output of the Inverse LUT. It should be noted that the W value is typically not out of gamut and does not need to be stored as 13 bits or tested for out-of gamut. When the color is in gamut, the lower 12 bits of the input values are gated around the multipliers, bypassing the gamut clamping as shown in FIG. 6.<br>
SubPixel Rendering<br>
[067] The SPR module could be any known subpixel rendering algorithm - including several that are disclosed in many of the above incorporated applications. In mis application, the output from multi-primary conversion is hi linear color components so the sub-pixel rendering module may not have to perform input gamma conversion. This also means that the input components will have more than 8 bits per primary, 12 bits in this case. In the architectural diagram, the output gamma being performed after the subpixel rendering allows the data to stay in the linear domain until the last moment before being converted to send to the display.<br>
Output Gamma LUT<br>
[068] One possible embodiment for handling output gamma would be to measure the gamma curves of the Red Green and Blue sub-pixels directly. These would be used to create inverse gamma curves to compensate for the non-linear response of the display. Because an sRGB<br>
input gamma curve is used on the input, the net effect of the gamma pipeline is to apply only an sRGB curve to all data. So the exact output gamma LUT used may change based on the final display configuration.<br>
