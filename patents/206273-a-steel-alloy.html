rom the manufacturing of the steel. The closest comparable standardized steel is AISI420F. Steels of this type have an adequate corrosion resistance, but do not have a martensitic micro-structure which is as homogenous that is desirable, but may contain ferrite and hard spots, which are due to retained, untempered martensite, which in turn can be explained by a certain segregation tendency of the steel. Therefore it exists a demand of improvements as far as holder steels are concerned. It is also desirable that the same steel, possibly with some modification of the composition, also shall be useful for the ■actual moulding tooL<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is an object of the invention to provide a steel, which after hardening and tempering has a more even structure than the above mentioned steel, essentially without feirite and/or spots in the material which have a pronouncedly higher hardness.<br><br>
rhe invention also aims to achieve one or several of the following effects:<br>
■	A good machinability.<br>
■	An adequate corrosion resistance.<br><br>
-	An adequate hardenability, considering the steel shall be possible to be used for the manufacturing of holder blocks made of plates which may have a thickness of up to at least 300 mm and in some cases even up to 400 mm thickness.<br>
-	An adequate ductility/toughness,<br>
-	A hardness of 30 - 42 HRC, preferably 38-40 HRC in the tough-hardened condition.<br>
-	A good polishability, at least according to a preferred embodiment, in order to able to be used also for moulding tools on which high demands are raised as far as polishability is concerned.<br>
The above objectives can be achieved if the steel has the chemical composition which is stated in the appending patent claims.<br>
As far as the importance of the separate elements and their interaction in the steel are concerned, the following may be considered to apply without binding the claimed patent protection to any specific theory.<br>
Carbon and nitrogen are elements which have a great importance for the hardness and ductility of the steel. Carbon is also an important hardenability promoting element. Carbon, however, binds chromium in the form of chromium carbides (M7C3-carbides) and may therefore impair the corrosion resistance of the steeL The steel therefore may contain max 0.15 % carbon, preferably max 0.13 % carbon (in this text always weight-% is referred to if not otherwise is stated). However, carbon also has some advantageous effects, such as to exist together with nitrogen as a dissolved element in the tempered martensite in order to contribute to the hardness thereof and also acts as an austenite stabilizer and thence counteract ferrite in the structure. The minimum amount of carbon in the steel therefore shall be 0.06%, preferably at least 0.07 %.<br>
Nitrogen contributes to the provision of a more even, more homogenous distribution of carbides and carbonitrides by affecting the solidification conditions in the alloy system such that larger aggregates of carbides are avoided or are reduced during the solidify-catioa The proportion of M23C6-carbides also is reduced in favour of M(C,N), Le. vanadium-carbonitrides, which has a favourable impact on the ductility/toughness. In summary, nitrogen contributes to the provision of a more favourable solidification<br><br>
process implying smaller carbides and nitrides, which can be broken up during the working to a more finely dispersed phase. From these reasons nitrogen shall exist in an amount of at least 0.07 % preferably at least 0.08 %, but not more than 0.22 %, preferably max 0.15 %, at the same time as the total amount of carbon and nitrogen shall satisfy the condition 0.16 <c n preferably c shall be at least but suitably max nominally the steel contains in hardened and tempered nitrogen is substantially dissolved martensite form of nitrogen-martensite solid solution thence contributes to desired hardness.></c>
In summary, as far as the content of nitrogen is concerned, it can be stated that nitrogen shall exist in the said minimum amount in order to contribute to the desired corrosion resistance by increasing the so called PRE-value of the matrix of the steel, to exist as a dissolved element in the tempered martensite which contributes to the hardness of the martensite, and to form carbonitrides, M(C, N), to a desired degree together with carbon, but not exceed said maximum content, maximizing the content of carbon + nitrogen, where carbon is the most important hardness contributor.<br>
Silicon increases the carbon-activity of the steel and thence the tendency to precipitate more primary carbides. This is a first reason why it is desirable that the steel has a low content of silicon. Further, silicon is a ferrite stabilizing element, which is a disadventageous feature of silicon As the steel also shall contain the ferrite stabilizing elements chromium and molybdenum in sufficient amounts to provide desirable effects by those elements, at the same time as the steel contains a lower content of carbon than is conventional in steels for the application in question, the content of silicon should be restricted in order not to cause the steel to contain ferrite in its matrix. The steel therefore must not contain more that 1 % Si, preferably max. 0.7 % Si, suitably max. 0.5 % Si, and most conveniently a still lower content of silicon. Generally the rule shall apply that the ferrite stabilizing elements shall be adapted to the austenite stabilizing ones in order to avoid formation of ferrite in the steel. However, silicon exists as a residue from the desoxidation treatment, wherefore the optimum content of silicon lies in the range 0.05 - 0.5 %, normally in the range 0.1 - 0.4 %, and is nominally about 0.2 - 0.3 %.<br>
Manganese is an element which promotes austenite and hardenability, which is a favourable effect of manganese, and can also be employed for sulphur refining by forming harmless manganese sulphides in the steel. Manganese therefore shall exist in a minimum amount of 0.1 %, preferably at least 0.3 %. Manganese, however has a<br><br>
segregation tendency together with phosphorous which can give rise to tempering-embrittlement. Manganese therefore must not exist in an amount exceeding 2 %, preferably max. 1.5 %, suitably max. 1.3 %.<br>
Chromium is the main alloying element of the steel and is essentially responsible for provision of the stainless character of the steel, which is an important feature of holders and holder details for plastic moulding tools, as well as for the plastic moulding tool itself which often is used in damp environments, which may cause less corrosion resistant steels to rust.<br>
Chromium also is the most important hardenability promoting element of the steel. However, no substantial amounts of chromium are bound in the form of carbides, because the steel has a comparatively low carbon content, wherefore the steel can have a chromium content as low as 12.5 % and nevertheless get a desired corrosion resistance. Preferably the steel, however, contains at least 13.0 % chromium. The upper limit is determined in the first place by the ferrite forming tendency of chromium. The steel therefore must not contain more than max. 14.5 % Cr, preferably max. 14.0 % Cr. Nominally, the steel should contain 13.1-13.7 % Cr.<br>
Nickel should exist in the steel in a minimum amount of 0.8 %, preferably at least 1.0 %, in order to afford the steel a very high hardenability. Prom cost reasons, however, the content should be limited to max. 2.5 %, preferably to max. 2.0 %. Nominally, the steel contains 1.4 -1.8 % or about 1.6 % M.<br>
Optionally, the steel of the invention also may contain an active content of vanadium in order to bring about a secondary hardening through precipitation of secondary carbides in connection with the tempering operation, wherein the tempering resistance is increased. Vanadium, when present, also acts as a grain growth inhibitor through the precipitation of MC-carbides. If the content of vanadium is too high, however, there will be formed large primary MC-caibonitrides during the solidification of the steel, and this also occurs if the steel is subjected to ESR-remelting, which primary carbides will not be dissolved during the hardening procedure. For the achievement of the desired secondary hardening and for the provision of a favourable contribution to the grain growth inhibition, but at the same time avoiding formation of large, undissolvable primary carbides in the steel, the optional content of vanadium should lie in the range 0.07 - 0.7 % V. A suitable content is 0.10 - 0.30 % V, nominally about 0.2 % V.<br><br>
Preferably, the steel also contains an active content of molybdenum, e.g. at least 0.1 %, in order to give a hardenability promoting effect. Molybdenum up to an amount of at least 1.0 % also promotes the corrosion resistance but may have effect also if the content is higher. When tempering, molybdenum also contributes to increasing the tempering resistance of the steel, which is favourable. On the other hand, a too high content of molybdenum may give rise to an unfavourable carbide structure by causing a tendency to precipitation of grain boundary carbides and segregations. Besides, molybdenum is ferrite stabilizing, which is unfavourable. The steel therefore shall contain a balanced content of molybdenum in order to take advantage of its favourable effects but at the same time avoid those ones which are unfavourable. Preferably, the content of molybdenum should not exceed 1.7 %. An optimal content may lie in the range 0.1 - 0.9 %, probably in the range 0.4 - 0.6 % Mo.<br>
Normally, the steel does not contain tungsten in amounts exceeding the impurity level, but may possibly be tolerated in amounts up to 1 %.<br>
The steel of the invention shall be possible to be delivered in its tough-hardened condition, which makes it possible to manufacture large sized holders and mould tools through machining operations. The hardening is carried out through austenitizing at a temperature of 850 - 1000 °C, preferably at 900- 975 °C, or at about 950 °CS followed by cooling in oil or in a polymer bath, by cooling in gas in a vacuum furnace, or in air. The high temperature tempering for the achievement of a tough hardened material with a hardness of 30 - 42 HRC, preferably 38 - 41 or about 40 HRC, which is suitable for machining operations, is performed at a temperature of 510 - 650 °C, preferably at 520 - 540 °C, for at least one hour, preferably through double tempering; twice for two hours. The steel may, as an alternative, be low temperature tempered at 200 - 275 °C, e.g. at about 250 °C, in order obtain a hardness of 38 - 42 or about 40 HRC.<br>
The steel may, according to a preferred embodiment, also contain an active content of sulphur, possibly in combination with calcium and oxygen, in order to improve the machinability of the steel in its tough hardened condition. In order to obtain best effect in terms of machinability improvement, the steel should contain at least 0.07 % S if the steel does not also contain an intentionally added amount of calcium and oxygen, and at least 0.035 %, respectively, if the steel also contains an active amount of calcium and oxygen. The maximum sulphur content of the steel is 0.25 %, when the steel is intentionally alloyed with a content of sulphur. A suitable sulphur content in this case may be 0.12 %. Also anon-sulphurized variant of the steel, however, can be conceived.<br><br>
la this case the steel does not contain sulphur above impurity level, and nor does that steel contain any active contents of calcium and/or oxygen.<br>
It is thus conceivable that the steel may contain 0.035 - 0.25 % S in combination with 3 - 100 weight-ppm Ca, preferably 5-75 ppm Ca, suitably max. 40 ppm Ca, and 10 -100 ppm O, wherein said calcium, which may be supplied as silicon-calcium, CaSi, in order to globulize existing sulphides to form calcium sulphides, counteracts that the sulphides get a non-desired, elongated shape, which might impair the ductility.<br>
The steel of the invention can be manufactured conventionally at a production scale by manufacturing a metal melt in the normal way, said melt having a chemical composition according to the invention, and casting the melt into large ingots or casting the melt continuously. It is also possible to cast electrodes of the molten metal and then remelting the electrodes through Electro-Slag-Remelting (ESR). It is also possible to manufacture ingots powder-metallurgically through gas-atomization of the melt to produce a powder, which then is compacted through a technique -which may comprise hot isostatic pressing, so called HEPing, or, as an alternative, manufacture ingots through sprayforming.<br>
Further characteristics, aspects and features of the steel according to the invention, and its usefulness for the manufacturing of holders and moulding tools, will be explained more in detail in the following through a description of performed experiments and achieved results.<br>

EXAMINATION OF STEELS MANUFACTURED AT ALABORATORY SCALE Fig. 1 shows a holder block 1 of atypical design, which shall be possible to be manufactured of the steel according to the invention. In the blockl there is a cavity 2, which shall accommodate a mould tool, usually a plastic moulding tool. The block 1 has considerable dimensions and the cavity 2 is large and deep. Therefore, a number of different requirements are raised on the material according to the invention, i.a. an adequate hardenability with reference to the considerable thickness of the block, and-a good ability to be machined by means of cutting tools, such as mill cutters and borers.<br>
Material<br>
17 Q-ingots (50 kg laboratory heats) with compositions according to Table I were manufactured in four rounds. In the first round (Q9043-Q9080), ingots were manufactured having chemical compositions within a wide range; e.g. variants having comparatively high contents of nitrogen were tested. It was revealed that the alloy having the most interesting features was Q9068, i.e. with carbon contents lying in medium range around 0.10 % and with moderate contents of nitrogen.<br>
In the second round (Q9129-Q9132) one tried to optimize the features that were obtained by Q9068. The carbon content was slightly varied, vanadium was added in order to obtain a fines: grain size, and the nickel content was lowered for one of the variants.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
unavoidable impurities, and/or 0.14 C, 0.18 Si, 1.30 Mn, 0.10 S, 13.5 Cr, 1.67Ni,0.50 Mo, 0.22 V, 0.10 N, balance iron and unavoidable impurities.<br>
MANUFACTURING OF STEEL AT A PRODUCTION SCALE A 35 tons heat of molten metal was manufactured in an electric arc furnace. Before tapping, the melt had the following chemical composition: 0.15 C, 0.18 Si, 0.020 P, 0.08 S7 13.60 Cr, 1.60 Ni, 0.48 Mo, 0.20 V, 0.083 N, balance Fe and unavoidable impurities. Of the melt there were manufactured ingots, which were forged to the shape of flat rods of varying dimensions. The forging did not cause any problems. The forged rods were tough-hardened to a hardness of about 380 HB through austenitizing at 950 °C, holding time 2h, fast quenching in air and tempering at 540 °C3 2x2h. The thus tough-hardened rods were machined to final gauges.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
