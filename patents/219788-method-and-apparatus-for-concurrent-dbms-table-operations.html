Method and Apparatus for  Concurrent DBMS Table Operations<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Field of the Invention	<br>
This invention relates to a process aÂ£ unloading and loading a database table. The invention is more particularly related to the application of parallel processing techniques to increase the speed at which database tables are unloaded and loaded. The invention is still further related to parallel processing techniques applied to unloading and loading database tables in a Symmetrical Multi-Processing . (SMF] environment.<br>
Discusaion of the Background Modem   database   management   systems   are increasingly called upon to maintain larger stores of data.  In addition to the increased size of databases, the structure within modem databases la increasingly complex.<br>
Typically, a database maintains data in the form of tables, each table maintaining one or more rows of related data. As an example, a basic database table may maintain plural rows having, for example, name, social security number, address and telephone number of Individuals belonging to an organization.<br>
The database would be increased in size as the organization adds new members, and would Increase in both size and complexity as additional information about members is included. For example, a larger and more complex database could maintain, in addition to the above information, a map, perhaps in graphical format, showing the club members' residence.  The<br><br>
database could again be increased in size and complexity by including a work address and an additional graphical map showing the location of the work place.<br>
The database table may again be increased in complexity by maintaining pointers to other tables or rows of the database. For example, a pointer to a set of coworfcers maintained in another table, pointers to nearby organization members, or a pointer(s) to any number of items to where additional member data may be maintained.<br>
Conventional Database Management Systems (DBMS) provide space for building database tables by allocating blocks. Once a table is defined, the DBMS will allocate blocks necessary for storing rows of the related data. For example, if a table is to be built to contain 100,000 rows, and the rows of the table were defined such that 100 rows could fit per block, the DBMS would allocate 1,000 blocks to build the table.<br>
Generally, DBMS systems allocate blocks in sets of contiguous blocks. A contiguous set of allocated blocks is commonly referred to as an extent. As a general rule, extents vary in size. Using the above exanple, the DBMS may utilize a single extent of 1,000 blocks, 2 extents of 500 blocks, or any other combination of extent sizes to allocate the required 1,000 blocks to build the table. Once the required blocks are allocated, the data is then stared in rows in the table utilizing the blocks allocated.<br>
Over the course of time, additional data may be added to the table and the DBMS will allocate additional blocks as required. For example, if a user adds 250 rows to the table, using the above parameters, an additional 3 blocks would need to be allocated.<br><br>
Also over Che course of time, information in the database may be deleted. In this case, deletion of rows occurs through the use of SQL to delete tows from the table. For example, a user may delete fifty rows from block 1, 40 rowa from block 20, and 30 rows from block 60. When this occurs, it causes there to be more blocks in the table than required to maintain. the data present in the table.<br>
In addition, data within the database will be updated. For example, using the above-described database tables, a organization member who has not yet entered the workforce would have a row in the table allocated that maintained his/her name, address, social security and telephone number. Upon entering the workforce, the row would be updated to include the work address and related information. However, if a substantial amount of information is added as a result of the update, the original row may not have enough blocks of data allocated to maintain the updated information.<br>
Row migration occurs when a row gets updated and the original row does not have enough space to hold all of the updated information. When this occurs, the row is moved to a location with more space, and a pointer is placed in the block where the original row resided, the pointer being set to point to the location of the moved (migrated) row. A large amount of row migration is caused if there are substantial updates to a table and an inadequate amount of space was allocated for the original rows.<br>
More often then not, there is insufficient space within a block to hold an updated row. In this case, the row is migrated to an entirely different block than where the original row resided, and the pointer is<br><br>
placed in the original row position points to the updated row in the different hlock.<br>
Anytime a row is migrated it causes what is known as fragmentation. Fragmentation causes greatly increased retrieval time of database infozmation because in addition to reading a block, a pointer must be read and interpreted. When a row is migrated to another block, at least two blacks (the block containing the pointer, and the block containing the migrated/fragmented row) must be read to retrieve row specific information. Other structural changes within the database tables also cause fragmentation and related efficiency problems (row chaining, for example) .<br>
From time to time, the Database Adiministrator (DBA) will perform an analysis on the DBMS tables that provides information regarding the condition of the tables. For example, the database administrator may look at information regarding the number of deleted rows to ascertain efficiency information with respect to how many blocks are holding deleted rows. As another example, the Database Administrator may look to see how many rows of a table have been nigrated or fragmented by other processes.<br>
If a lot of fragmentation has occurred, it indicates that block size and row space could be more efficiently allocated and that table data is not being retrieved efficiently. When this occurs, the databaae administrator will likely decide to rebuild the tables. When creating a table, the DBA makes a decision regarding the structure of a database table by setting a percentage of blocks free (PCTFREE) or percentage of blocks used (PCTUSED). As the DBMS fills up each block with row or table information,  it will keep a<br><br>
percentage of a block free at least equal to the percentage PCTFREE.<br>
The DBA sets the PCTFHES variable depending on how the database table is to be used.  For example, if a table is to have frequent updates, additional PCTFREE would be established so that enough space is available to allow any necessary row migration to occur within the same block.  As discussed above, row migration within the same block does not cause a table to became fragmented.  Migrated, but non-fragmented rows are retrieved with a single block read rather than the cumbersome process of reading a block, interpreting a pointer, and reading a second block (or more) as occurs when migrated rows are fragmented.   Therefore, appropriate PCTFREE settings allow DBMS performance to be maintained although the database tables may be modified.<br>
PCT17SED is another parameter that allows the DBA to control the structure of a DBMS table. The DBMS prevents additional rows to be placed in a block unless the percentage of that block has fallen below PCTUSED. PCTUSED is different from PCTFREE in the sense that although a block may be used if there is an update, it will not be used to insert a new row unless the percentage used in the block is below PCTUSED,<br>
A DBMS table involved in heavy OLTP activity (inserts, updates and deletes) over time will likely experience row migration, fragmentation, row chaining, etc. Furthermore, various database tables may not necessarily have appropriate settings (PCTFREE, PCTUSED, for example) when first built, or the needs of the database table may have changed, resulting in additional migration, deletion or fragmentation of<br><br>
tables. This In turn results in a degradation or data retrieval performance and space usage.<br>
The DBA will perform an analysis to determine whether the tables are storing data efficiently. As a result, one or more of the DBMS tables may be determined to being inefficient In storing and retrieving data. Reorganization (rebuilding) of the table is a solution to this problem. In order to achieve maximum performance the table needs to be rebuilt (i.e., the data unloaded into secondary space and a fresh instance of the table rebuilt). This process gets rid of many of the imvanted effects mentioned above because the fragmented rows are unloaded and stored without fragmentation in the rebuilt table.<br>
Structurally sound databases make efficient use of disk space. They require less time to access data, reduce the time required for normal transactions, and provide better response time to the user. Even though Oracle and other modem database systems use efficient logic for data placement, normal activity over time causes the physical layout of the data on disk to degrade and space requirements to grow. This results in excessive space usage and extra time needed to perform table scans, database backups, and other functions. Partial empty pages and unused extent space contribute to the additional space usage. Also, nonsequential rows and extent interleaving seriously degrade performance if they are not resolved periodically.<br>
One method to ensure that databases stay efficient<br>
(increasing productivity) is to regularly perform<br>
reorganizations on the databases' data.  Currently,<br>
products are available to reorganiza -OBMS tables.<br><br>
However, even with automated reorganization tools, reorganization of database tables can require substantial amounts of time. The time required to perform a reorganization can have substantial effects on revenue or productivity of a shop tliat requires database access. For example, some shops can incur costs of approximately $100,000 an hour when a database is off-line {See Dec. 1997 issue of Oracle magazine, "Reorgs in a Non-Stop Shop," for example} . Therefore, any improvement in efficiency or speed at which a reorganization is performed would increase competitiveness and profitability.<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
CONCURRENT UNLOAD/LOAD OPTION IN TS REORGANIZATION<br>
The present inventor has developed a new Concurrent Unload/Load methodology. This methodology will be utilized in an Unload/Load option to be introduced in Platinum TS reorg V2.1.0 to enhance the speed of tablespace reorganization. Previously, the fastest way to reorganize a tablespace in TS reorg was to use Fast Unload in conjunction with the Parallel Direct Load option.<br>
Referring now to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals designate identical or corresponding parts throughout the several views, and more particularly to Figure 1 thereof, is a flowchart illustrating a Fast Unload/Load process. At step 100, a single Fast Unload process unloads each table, and steps 100a . . 110n illustrate parallel direct loads utilized to load tables.<br>
Figure 2 is flow diagram detailing the Fast Unload process. At step 200, a Past Unload is performed on a table. The Fast Unload reads and stores data from the table. At step 210, it la determined whether a next table in the database (s) is to be unloaded and the process is repeated until each table is unloaded.<br>
As illustrated by the process in Figures 1 and 2, in Parallel Direct Load, the tables are unloaded sequentially using one single process on the unload and multiple SQL*LOADERâ¢ (an ORACLE utility) processes on the load, while working on only one table at a time. For example, when unloading a tablespace containing a large number of tables, TS reorg must wait for one<br><br>
table to be completely unloaded before it can process the  next table.<br>
Figure 3 illustrates the Concurrent Unload/Load option of the present invention that enables a user to take advantage of multi-CPU machines to unload (step 300) and load (step 305) multiple tables concurrently. This method is particularly efficient when the tablespace contains a combination of both large and small tables. Then, while TS reorg unloads and loads one large table, it can also unload and load several small tables simultaneously. The principles of the present invention are also extended to the concurrent building of multiple indexes and/or constraints.<br>
The Concurrent Unload/Load process oÂ£ the present invention are best practiced in a computing and database environment having the following characteristics:<br>
(1) Symmetric Multi Processing (SMP) computing environment - impropriate computing hardware contains multiple CPUs and must accommodate a symmetrical multiprocessing environment. The higher the symmetrical multiprocessing capacity of a hcst machine, the higher performance potential.<br>
One type of multiprocessor computer is a aynmetric multiprocessor (SMP) computer. An SMP computer usually has between 2 and 16 processors, all of which share the computer's single memory source and shared storage devices. The SMP capacity depends on the number of processors available. With more processors, the present invention allows more queries and loads to be performed in parallel.<br>
(2) Datafiles partitioned across multiple disks -The datafiles of the tablespace to unload reorganization must be stored on different physical<br><br>
disks. This requirement is needed to obtain full benefit from the Concurrent Unload/Load processes of the present invention.<br>
(3) Defined export directories on disks - A number of threads used for the Concurrent Unload/Load option processes will be less than or equal to the number of export directories. These directories are best utilized when residing on separate physical disks. Even with a high SMP capacity and efficient parallel operations, data movement can experience a tottlsneck, or a halting reduction in speed, because of the limited bandwidth of physical storage dis3cs. One of the few limitations of SMP occurs when physical disks cannot quickly accommodate the simultaneous read and write requests made by the numerous CPUs.<br>
Another source of interrupted data, especially in parallel processing, is disk contention. When multiple processes attempt to access and change a database, the disk head can serve the rec[uest of only one process at a time, causing the other operations to wait. This situation of two processes simultaneously trying to access the same disk is called disk contention. The result of disk contention is clogged data, or a bottleneck.<br>
Since parallel processes use multiple CPUs to move data between memory and disks, it is important to have multiple disks defined, so that the numerous CPUs can quickly move the data without interruptions or waiting. One way to eliminate bottlenecks is by partitioning the data to multiple disks. Partitioning data is the process of physically spreading the data across multiple disk drives to reduce the limiting effects of disk I/O bandwidths and disk contention. The more disks you define (partition) for data export,<br><br>
the more you reduce I/O bottlenecks, which results in faster parallel operations.<br>
Figure 4 illustrates parallel processes using only one export disk. Even though the server's query coordinator breaks the query into two separate operations, the disk head can serve the request of only one scan at a time, causing the other operations to wait, or bottleneck. In this exan^le, the single disk's I/O limitations defeat the purpose of the server's parallel process features. Resolving this problem depends on proper disk allocation.<br>
Figure 5 illustrates one embodiment of a proper disk allocation, and parallel processes using numerous export disks (partitioned data) . The parallel processes run simultaneously, rather than one process waiting for the other.<br>
Using Concurrent Threads in TS reorg<br>
The Concurrent Load/Unload processes of the present invention utilize a number of defined threads that determines a number of tables to be tmloaded/loaded at the same time. In other words, the number of concurrent threads is equal to the number of processes that TS reorg launches in the unload and load phase. Bach of these processes works on one table.<br>
The number of defined threads is limited by a number of export directories. Figure 6 illustrates an SMP computing environment having three separate disks, 310a, 310b, and 31.0c, each disk storing datafiles and each having an export directory 320a, 320b, and 320c. In the illustrated environment the Concurrent Load/Unload would define three threads (one per export directory) for unloading tables.<br><br>
Concurrent Unload Phase<br>
Figure 7 ia a flowchart illustrating the Concurrent Unload phase of the present invention. At step 400, a number of threads to be utilized in a current confuting environment is determined. The number of threads to utilize is provided by a user via a GUI or other input device. However, the number of threads is also limited to a maximum equivalent to a number of export directories residing on separate disk drives. For example, TS reorg now utilizes a destination Tab Property Page to enter, change or delete the export directory paths designating the location for the unloaded data and other export files during a tablespace reorg (see Fig. 8).<br>
During the export phase of a tablespace reorg, the reorg utility uxiloads the Data Description Language (DDL) and table data from the tablespace and exports it to a specified directory. The Host Directory Path(s) for Export is the directory path designating the location for the unloaded DDL and data during a reorg.<br>
The Destination tab property page is utilized to do the following:<br>
â¢	Add a host export directory.<br>
â¢	Delete a host export directory. .   Modify a host export directory.<br>
If insufficient space available in the export directory or the export file size reaches the ulfmit while the reorg utility is unloading data, the reorg utility aborts the remaining data to the next specified export directory. If another export directory is not specified, the TS reorg will not perform the reorganization.<br>
This removes the 2-gigabyte limit common on most UNIX platforms.  Since a compressed file cannot be<br><br>
split, this does not apply to a compressed export method (described hereinafter).<br>
At step 410, TS reorg launches a same number of Fast Unload processes as the number of defined threads. This is referred to as the first set of Feist Unload processes.<br>
At Step 420, a table is assigned to each process. Each Past Unload process is executed by the corresponding thread and unloads the assigned table into one of the separate export directories (step 430). To search for a directory on which to unload data, each thread checks all of the export directories and chooses the smallest available directory that can accommodate the created export file. Such a method is known as finding the best fit for the export directories. Once a thread finds a best fit directory, it claims that directory, so the next thread must choose  another.<br>
In the event that other applications are using space on the same file system, a thread might not load all its data into its chosen best fit directory. If this occurs, the reorg utility splits the export file into multiple export files and attempts to write it on another export directory. If there is no alternate export directory, or if the disk is full, the thread terminates and one of the remaining threads unloads the remaining data.<br>
A user may estimate the size of the user's export files in order to assign enough space in an export directory for those files. To estimate the size of an export file, divide the current allocation of an object by the number of threads to be utilized.<br>
The reorg utility utilizes a Parallel Query tab property page, as shown in Figure 9, to fill in fields<br><br>
along with amy existing parallel parameters for the object. For example, a table's parallel parameters might exist if that table was initially created or revised using parallel parameters. Those parameters are retained within the taiale' s Data Description Language (DDL) and the Data Dictionary. If parallel parameters already exist for an object, the reorg utility splits the data query automatically, and a user need not specify values in the Parallel Query tab property page. Otherwise, Che reorg utility splits the query according to the parameters set in the Parallel Query tab property page.<br>
For full advantage of the present invention, the number of export directories is equal to or greater than the number of threads. Also, each export directory should reside on a separate physical disk to avoid disk I/O bottlenecks. As discussed above, I/O bottlenecks will likely occur if more than one export directory is located on a same disk because of the possibility of more than one process writing (unloading] to the same disk at the same time.<br>
When the first Fast Unload process of the first set of threads finishes, TS reorg checks if the process was successfully terminated (step 440}, if that was the case, the next Fast Unload process to unload a next table is launched {step 470).<br>
In this manner, each table is unloaded by a process executed in it's respective thread. Each thread is independent, therefore if one thread has a process assigned to a large table, the other processes need not wait for the large process to finish before launching the process for the next table.<br>
Otherwise, if a problan occurred during the unload of the table, TS reorg displays a reason why the<br><br>
process failed (step 450), along with eventually the Fasc Unload logfile in the job logfile. The table that a problem occurred is unloaded using an internal unload program of TS reorg. This unload program is not launched as a separate process and therefore it has to be finished before TS reorg can continue with the concurrent unload of the rest of the tables.<br>
Once all the tables have been successfully unloaded, the unload process is completed, A performance meter (estimated, or interactive) may also be implemented to display the speed of unload/load operations and an amount of disk space being consumed.<br>
Once the unload process is completed, TSreorg continues with the next step of the tablespace reorganization which is the export of other objects of the tablespace (step 485).<br>
Export. oÂ£ other objects includes the creation of a files for storing the DDL of the tablespace including all indexes, triggers, constraints, and primary or unique keys (everything except the table and clusters).<br>
Finally, TS reorganization performs a drop on the unloaded tables (step 490) , and then performs a concurrent load (step 495) loading the unloaded data into fresh tablespace.<br>
Concurrent Load Phase<br>
After dropping all of the tablespace objects, TS reorg begins the load (insert) phase of the reorganization. The concurrent load phase is illustrated in the flowchart of Figure 10. At step 600, TS reorg begins the load phase by creating tables to store the data. TS reorg sequentially creates as many tables as the number of threads specified,  The<br><br>
specified number of threads is equivalent to the number of threads in the unload phase.<br>
After the first set of tables is created, TS reorg simultaneously launches the SQL*LOADERâ¢ processes used to load the data of each corresponding table. The number of processes launched is equal to the number of threads. Each SQL*LOADERâ¢ process loads data for one corresponding table, reading table data from an export directory and loading that data into the corresponding table (step SIO) .<br>
The reorg utility recreates the objects, eliminating fragmentation and optimizing storage parameters, using the DDL in the export files. The reorg utility coordinates multiple CPUs in parallel threads to load the data back into the objects, resulting in a reorganized tablespace.<br>
After one of these processes is consisted, TS reorg checks if the data was successfully loaded back into the table and if the number of rows inserted was correct {Step 620) . If an error occurred during the load or the number of rows inserted by SQL*LOADERâ¢ was not correct, TS reorg switches automatically to the internal TS reorg load function to load sequentially the data before continuing with the next table (step 630) . If there was no error with the SQL*L0ADER" process, or after the internal load terminated without error, TS reorg creates Che next table (step 650) and launches concurrently still another SQL*LOADERâ¢ process to load this table's data (repeating step 610).<br>
As illustrated in the concurrent Table Reorganization diagram shown in Figure 11, a concurrent direct load invokes multiple CPUs, each of which executes a separate SQL+LOADER'" session to synchronously load data from the export file:3 back into<br><br>
the object's datafiles. When SQL*ljQADBRâ¢ writes to these datafiles, the reorg utility uses the best fit method, which selects those partitioning directories that have enough space to acccanmodate the incoming data. The reorg utility then continues using the hest fit method within that selected list of directories and chooses the smallest datafile that can accommodate all of the incoming data for the thread. Each thread loads its data into as much free space in a datafile as it can.<br>
If a fatal error occurs during the load phase, or if the reorganization job is canceled or killed for any reason, the failed job becomes a job that needs recovery. As shovn in Figure 12, after a job has failed {step 1105), TS reorg automatically skips all the tables that have been already successfully created and loaded before the failure (step lllO) and only loads concurrently the non-existing tcibles or the tables that were not completely loaded (step lllS) .<br>
As shown in Figure 13, during the load phase, TS reorg first creates the tables under a temporary name (step 1300] . After the data has been reloadsd the temp table is renamed to the original name of the table (step 1320) . Finally, the primary constraints and indexes on the table are created (step 1330) . This allows TS reorg to recognize the tables that were not completely imported before the failure and to drop all tsnporary tables and restart the load for those tables (see process l11SA, Pig. 11).<br>
When using the concurrent Unload/Load option, TS reorg automatically selects the cation: Create all Indexes/Constraints after all of the Tables have been Created. The indexes and constraints of this tablespace are created after all of the tables are<br><br>
successfully created and their data reloaded into the tables.<br>
CONCURRENT INDEX CREATION IN TS REORG<br>
Concurrent index creation is an option can be used in a table or a tablespace reorganization to increase the speed of index creation during the reorganization. In a regular table or tablespace reorganization, the indexes are created one after another after the table is created and the data loaded back into Che cable.<br>
In a tablespace reorg, the user may select a concurrent index creation option. In this case, TS reorg will create Che indexes concurrently (sequential index creation is the default behavior} . This will allow TS reorg to gather all the indexes and constraints in one export file and when all the tables of the tablespace (in case of a tablespace reorganization) or the table to reorganize (in case of the table reorganization) has been created, it starts to create these indexes and constraints concurrently.<br>
When selecting this option, the user has to specify a number of threads which would be used as the number of process to launch concurrently during the index/constraint creation phase.<br>
When the import phase for indexes begins, TS reorg launches Che same number of Index creation processes as the number of specified threads. When the first index process of the first set oÂ£ threads finishes, a next index creation process is launched and subsequent index creation processes are similarly launched upon conflation of other threads until all the indexes and constraints are created.<br><br>
If an error occurs on the creation of one index or constraint, TS reorg logs the error and writes the DDL of the failed index into a file. The user can then manually edit and fix the problem.<br>
The present invention has been described with reference and in terms consistent ' with an implementation in conjunction with a Oracle database. However, the processes described are equally applicable to other known database products and custom database installations. For example, instead of utilizing the Oracle utility, SQL*LOADERâ¢, another program capable of reading table data stored in an export directory and loading the data into fresh table space may be utilized.<br>
