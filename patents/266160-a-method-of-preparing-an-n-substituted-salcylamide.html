It will be understood that in between addition of reagents and in particularly in between steps A, B or C, or indeed between the various parts of step B, evaporation, filtration, extraction and other final and/or preparatory steps may be conducted prior to commencing the next step.<br>
Conditions<br>
Unless stated to the contrary, the reaction steps of the present invention are most preferably conducted in an inert atmosphere, for example under a nitrogen atmosphere.<br>
Step A<br>
In step A, the reaction mixture is cooled to 0-5°C during the addition of the chloroformate and the mixture is then slowly heated to reflux temperature and refluxed until the reaction has reached a sufficient degree of completion. Typically the reaction mixture is refluxed for about 3 to 7 hours, and more especially for about 5 hours. The temperature of the reflux is dependent upon the alkyl acetate solvent present. A typical reflux temperature is in the range of 80 to 120°C.<br>
StepB<br>
In step B1, after addition of all the components of the reaction mixture except the sodium carbonate, the reaction mixture is heated to about 100°C. The addition of sodium carbonate then preferably takes place over about two hours.<br>
In step B2, the reaction mixture of is heated to about 100°C.<br>
In step B3, the reaction mixture is cooled to about 60°C prior to the addition of the acid. Preferably a temperature of about 60°C is maintained throughout the reaction and this temperature is preferably maintained throughout any subsequent purification steps, for example extractions. •<br>
In step B4, the alcohol (preferably ethanol) is added at about 50-60°C and then the solution cooled to about 40-50°C. Finally, the solution is cooled to about 0-5°C.<br>
In preferred embodiments, the present invention relates to a method of preparing N-(5-chlorosalicyloyl)-8-aminocaprylic acid (5-CNAC) and its corresponding salts, in particular its disodium monohydrate. In one particularly preferred embodiment, 5-CNAC is prepared from 5-chlorosalicyclic acid via 5-chloro carsalam, in the presence of ethyl-8 chlorooctanoate (ECO) as shown in Scheme 4 below <br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
Scheme 4<br>
The reagents for steps A, B and C are as hereinbefore described in Scheme 3.<br>
The most preferred reagents for processes described in the present invention, in particular for the process of Scheme 4 are as follows:<br>
In step A, the 5-chloro-salicylamide is reacted with ethylchloroformate (excess) In an n-butyl acetate/water mixture, with 5-ethyl-2-methyl-pyridine acting as the required organic base.<br>
In step B1 the 5-chloro-carsalam is reacted with ethylchlorooctanoate in the presence of a sodium carbonate and NaBr (bromide ion source} in dimethylformamide. NaBr is believed to act catalytically. In step B2, the resulting product is treated with, for example aqueous sodium hydroxide. Then, an acid, preferably a mineral acid such as sulfuric acid, is added followed by ethyl acetate. The crude product is recrystallised in ethanol.<br>
In step C the 5-CNAC is treated with sodium hydroxide in an acetone/water mixture,<br>
preferably at a ratio of acetonerwater of 3:1.<br>
A second aspect of the present invention, relates to the use of the N-substituted salicylamides and derivatives thereof, in particular 5-CNAC, and their corresponding salts, in particular their disodium monohydrate salts, when prepared by the method of the present invention, for delivering active agents, such as biologically or chemically active agents, to a target.<br>
A third aspect of the present invention relates to pharmaceutical compositions of the N-substituted salicylamides and derivatives thereof and salts thereof when prepared by the method of the present invention. In particular the present invention relates to pharmaceutical compositions comprising 5-CNAC when the 5-CNAC is prepared by the method of the present invention<br>
The disclosure hereinafter discusses the merits of the present invention primarily in terms of the synthesis of 5-CNAC. However, it will be appreciated that the discussion of the invention in these terms is not intended to limit the scope of the invention, which extends to the N-substituted salicylamides of general formula IV. Thus the following discussion of the synthesis In terms of 5-CNAC merely represents a preferred embodiment of the present invention which conveniently allows for comparisons between the present invention and the prior art. The skilled man will appreciate that the process of the present invention is not limited only to the synthesis of 5-CNAC.<br>
A preferred synthesis of the present invention provides an improved procedure for obtaining 5-CNAC as compared to the prior art. It will be recalled that the prior art, as described in Scheme 1, is a process in which the formation of 5-CNAC is achieved by reaction with ethyl-8 bromooctanoate in the presence of sodium carbonate and dimethyfacetamide.<br>
The synthesis of 5-CNAC of the present invention advantageously uses 5-chlorosalicylamide as a newly available starting material instead of 5-chlorosalicyiic acid in the prior art, thus avoiding currently present in the prior art.<br>
The present invention also provides a new procedure for the synthesis of 6-<br>
chlorocarsalam, a key intermediate in the process for the manufacture of 5-CNAC, in which a two-phase mixture (for example n-butyt acetate/water) with an alkyl substituted pyridine, for example a dialkylsubstituted pyridine such as 5-ethyt-2-methyl-pyridine as the base is used. The use of pyridine as the mild organic base is not precluded in the present invention, although it is not preferred. One particular advantage of using certain pyridine derivatives, e.g. 5-ethyl-2-methyl-pyridine, instead of pyridine in the prior art is that the former is recoverable under these conditions. In comparison, the prior art process uses a reaction mixture consisting of ethylchloroformate in acetonitrile, with pyridine as the base, none being reported as recoverable.<br>
The1 process of the present invention also achieves a major advantage over the prior art by the use of the two-phase system. This system enables the hydrolysis of unwanted intermediates caused by side reactions, which in turn removes them from the reaction mixture and as a result provides a much purer final product<br>
In a preferred synthesis of 5-CNAC from the previously prepared 6-chlorocarsalam according to the method of the present invention, ethyl-8-chlorooctonoate (ECO) is reacted with 6- chloro-carsalam in the presence of dimethytformamide and sodium carbonate (acting as the base) together with an amount of sodium bromide. These conditions are believed by the inventors to allow the formation of the more reactive ethyl-8-bromooctonoate (EBO) in situ. Sodium bromide can be recovered at the end of the reaction and in at least this sense the sodium bromide is believed to act catalytically.  Therefore the process of the present invention has removed the need to use ethyl-8-bromooctonoate (EBO) directly as a starting material. EBO has known health and environmental concerns due to its highly reactive characteristics. Furthermore, ECO is cheaper and more readily available than EBO.<br>
The intermediate ester (or esters) formed by the aforementioned reaction is (are) most preferably not isolated but saponified immediately after concentration of the end reaction mixture. This saponification is advantageous in eliminating the necessity of isolation of the product, thereby increasing the likelihood of obtaining a higher yield. This can be contrasted with the corresponding stage of the prior art which required the isolation of 8-[6-chloro-2H-1,3-benzoxazine-2,4(3H)dionyQoctanoate. The highly pure free acid is then obtained by extraction<br>
and crystallisation.<br>
Finally, the formation of the dlsodium monohydrate is formed (Step C) by the addition of sodium hydroxide in an acetone/water mixture advantageously allows a crystallisation from a homogenous solution, in contrast to the emulsion of the prior art where sodium hydroxide is added to pure acetone. The homogeneous solution allows large crystals to be obtained which might be dried on a standard rotary paddle.<br>
As a result of the changes implemented by the present invention (as exemplified for the above process for the synthesis of 5-CNAC), a new process has been developed that provides N-substituted salicylamides of formula IV, especially 5-CNAC (IVA), in both a cost-effective manner and at high purity.<br>
The process of the present invention, using the synthesis of 5-CNAC as an example, is described below in further detail, with particular reference to Schemes 5 and 6 below:<br>
Step A<br>
The temperature T as illustrated in Scheme 5 is preferably in the range of 80-120°C. Most preferably the temperature T is between 85-95°C. Particularly preferably, the temperature T is 90°C.<br>
(Figure Removed)<br><br><br>
Scheme 5<br><br>
A notable weakness of the prior art process is that it mainly gives a product which contains up to 10 % of the starting amide (IA). A second weakness is that the process is run in acetonitrile and pyridine (as can be seen from Scheme 1), where both acetonitrile and pyridine are unsuitable for recycling. This is both commercially more costly and environmentally less desirable.<br>
The corresponding step of the prior art process has two parts: (i)       acylation with ethylchloroformate at 0°C and (ii)      ring closure at reflux (90°C).<br>
HPLC analysis of the products of the prior art process has shown that during the acylation mainly one intermediate is formed while the starting material disappears completely. Upon heating, however, a second, new, intermediate is formed quickly, which slowly goes over to the desired 6-CI-carsalam, together with some starting material. The first intermediate is the N-acylated salicylamide (X), and the second is the O-acylated derivative (XX) (via the phenolic OH).<br>
In order to overcome the environmental problems associated with the prior art process, the inventors of the present invention first looked at an aqueous system, using a base such as sodium hydroxide instead of pyridine. However, it was found<br>
that when running the reaction in an aqueous medium with, for example, sodium hydroxide or sodium carbonate instead of pyridine, after ring closure and the formation of compound HA, much more starting material IA was present than in the prior art process suggesting that the reaction had not gone to completion or that decomposition had occurred.<br>
It was hypothesized that a further intermediate product is therefore formed, which upon heating may revert back to the starting material. This could be the 0-acylated amide, which is not separated by HPLC. This may be consistent with an increased reactivity at the amide-oxygen atom, as it is usually the case with strong bases, which favour O-acylation.<br>
Another explanation could be the decomposition of 6-chlorcarsalam under basic conditions in the same manner as occurs in Step B (ring opening with sodium carbonate at elevated temperature in dimethylformamide). However this explanation does not apply with pyridine. It was apparent, therefore, that mild organic bases were much to be preferred.<br>
In order to overcome the aforementioned "incomplete" reaction problem, the present invention provides a two-phase system. A preferred system is alkylacetate/organic base/water, for example butylacetate/substituted-pyridine/water, with an excess ethylchloroformate. Most preferred is n-butyl acetate/5-ethyl-2-methyl pyridine/water.<br>
It is hypothesized that in presence of water, hydrolysis of any unwanted intermediates (for example the 0-acylated intermediate) occurs rapidly, allowing acylation at the desired N atom (an amide nitrogen) so long as there is enough chloroformate. Under these conditions (20 % excess ethylchlorformate and 30 % alkyl-substituted pyridine) only 1-2 % starting material is found after ring closure.<br>
Since pyridine is not easily recovered from the aqueous mother liquors it is preferably replaced, without loss of selectivity, with a non-water soluble pyridine derivative, especially an alkyl pyridine, for example the non-water soluble 5-ethyl-2-methyl-pyridine. The use of a non-water soluble alkyl-pyridine allows the base to be recovered and so is preferred.<br>
The organic acetate solvent may be selected from methyl acetate, ethyl acetate, n-propyl acetate, isopropyl acetate or n-butylacetate. The preferred solvent is n-butylacetate, which azeotrope bolls at about 90°C. This allows a fast reaction typically of about 4-5h at reflux. The reaction in other solvents, such as ethyl acetate or isopropyl acetate although sucessful, requires more time since the boiling points of these solvents are lower.<br>
Butylacetate is further preferred due to its low aqueous solubility characteristics. Since butytacetate is substantially insoluble with water, it keeps IA in solution, thus yielding a very pure product (higher than 98 %). This is purer than the prior art process in which a less pure product of a mixture of IA/IIA is given. The yield of the reaction is over 90%, which is similar to the prior art process, except that the higher purity of the present process means that the overall yield of the product IIA is higher for the present invention.<br>
During ring closure, the mixture is preferably slowly (within two hours) heated from O'C through to about 90°C and refluxed.<br>
It is noted that in the process of the present invention, no over-alkylated carsalam (which could be formed when IIA reacts with ethylchloroformate) was observed, thus showing that excess reagent is destroyed before ring closure occurs, which is beneficial.<br>
IIA is readily purified by refluxing it in ethyl acetate/water allowing removal of up to 10 % starting material without loss of yield, should this be necessary.<br>
Bv-Droducts of Step A<br>
The corresponding 3,5-dichloro-isomer may be present in the starting material IA, leading to the 3,5-dichloro-isomer by-product. Preferably less than 1% and in particular less than 0.5% of the 3,5-dichloro-isomer is present in either the starting material or the final product, more preferably less than 0.07%<br>
StepB<br>
Reference is made in particular to Scheme 6 below:<br>
The compound ethyl-8-bromo-octanoate (EBO), which is used in the prior art processes comes at a high cost, both financially and environmentally since not only is it relatively expensive to buy but also, due to its high reactivity, it is a potential mutagenic alkylating agent and so causes serious safety issues both for its use and its disposal. On the other hand, the chloro equivalent, ECO, is cheaper and, due to its lower reactivity, is less of an environmental problem and health hazard. The health, economic and environmental advantages of ECO therefore enhance the benefits of the process of the present invention.<br>
In the development of the process of the invention, the change from EBO to ECO initially posed significant problems during this alkylation/deprotection step, which results in the free add (IV.II) or (IVA). These problems were however identified and overcome, as will be seen below, to establish the method of the present invention.<br><br><br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
Scheme 6<br>
It was found that compared to prior art, alkylation with only ECO present was slow at 80°C, presumably due to the lower reactivity of the chlorine-reagent. Further, with prolonged reaction time (required to ensure completion) more side products were formed. For example, under the same conditions 0.1 % di-acid by-product was formed with EBO, and 7 % with ECO.<br>
Increasing the temperature to 100°C increased the rate of the reaction but also increased the rate of decomposition of the "carsalam" salt. In fact in presence of moisture, sodium carbonate does not give cleanly the carsalam-sodium salt, it also<br>
opens partially the ring, producing the corresponding amide (IA) which reacts at both positions 0 and N. The dl-alkylated by-product which is thereby formed is not easily removed in the final step and therefore contaminates the final product. Formation of the di-alkylayed product is therefore not desirable.<br>
From experiments it was noted that only 2.2 % di-acid byproduct was generated with 1 eq. NaBr at 80°C in comparison to 7 % without NaBr.<br>
Under the preferred, optimized, conditions of 1 equivalents ECO, 0.2 equivalents sodium bromide, 0.55 equivalents sodium carbonate, at 100°C, the alkyiation proceeds with 95 % selectivity accompanied by only about 2 % di-alkylation, less than 1 % 0-alkyiation and full consumption of ECO.<br>
Finally, in order to prevent degradation of (HA), in the laboratory scale synthesis, the base (typically sodium carbonate) and HA are preferably first mixed together in an aprotic solvent (preferably dimethyformamide), and heated to 100°C prior to a slow addition of (III.III). With exemplary amounts being 0.98 equivalents of (III.Ill), 0.6 equivalents base (typically sodium carbonate) and 0.1 equivalents of sodium bromide, the present invention provides, reproducibly, an alkyiation with about 95 % desired product (mixture of ring closed and opened ester), about 2 % di-alkylated ester and about 3 % remaining (HA).<br>
It was found that, where sodium carbonate is used as the base, mixing all the starting materials together at room temperature followed by heating at a given rate led to the uncontrolled release of CO2l together with a transient thickness of the slurry, which is not convenient.<br>
Therefore, in an enhanced synthesis, ail of the starting materials except sodium carbonate are mixed together. The resulting mixture is then heated up to 100°C anc only then is the sodium carbonated slowly added, preferably portion-wise, or continuously in the solid form. No reaction occurs without sodium carbonate. The sole parameters to control are the amount and rate of base (sodium carbonate) addition.<br>
For this alternative variation of the synthesis of the present invention, a slight excess of sodium carbonate is preferred (0.55 equivalents which corresponds to 1.05-1.1 equivalents base) and preferably the sodium carbonate is added over about 2 hours. This gives a reaction with only a minor side reaction (less than 1 % di-alkylation). In order to obtain more than 95% selectivity (i.e. 95% of the desired conversion), 1 equivalents of (HUH) (instead of 0.98) and 0.2 equivalents sodium bromide (instead of 0.1 equivalents) are advantageously used.<br>
Ring opening occurs by the end of the reaction of step B1, although this tends not to be complete and is believed to be dependent on the amount of excess of sodium carbonate used. Typically at least 30-50% ring opening occurs by the end of the reaction step, making the isolation of the pure intermediate (VIA) undesirable. Advantageously, however, saponification and completion of the ring opening are then carried out immediately in the same vessel since after saponification both intermediates (VIA and VIIA) give the desired product, IVA. Thereby one single product IVA (5-CNAC free acid) is obtained, which can be isolated after acidification.<br>
To optimise the saponification, so avoiding isolation of the intermediate, preferably the solvent should be eliminated totally by distillation. In order to do this, it is preferred to use dimethytformamide instead of dimethylacetamide, since DMF has a lower boiling point.<br>
The solvent is removed by distillation under vacuum at 100'C, leaving an oily heterogeneous residue. The latter was mixed with water and treated at 80-1 OO'C with excess sodium hydroxide. Ring opening and saponification are very rapid. After saponification, the solution was cooled to 60°C, neutralized with sulfuric acid to pH 8-9 and afterwards diluted with ethylacetate.<br>
Thereafter, the pH was lowered to 2-3, allowing the product to go into the organic phase. The water phase is discarded and the organic phase is washed with water. Then fresh water was added and the ethylacetate distilled off under normal pressure, leaving IVA as a suspension in water. At that stage, or even before, isolation of the crude product is possible.<br>
The aqueous suspension was diluted with ethanol, which allowed the dissolution of the acid (IVA) at around 60°C. To this solution is added an amount of sodium hydroxide, which was revealed to be necessary to keep the di-acid by-product in the solution (and thus not contaminate the crystalisation process). Upon cooling pure IVA crystallizes out of the solution. It is collected by centrifugation at 0°C and dried under vacuum at 60"C. Preferably, the di-acid is present below 0.6 %.<br>
The above crystallization of IVA is optimized In such a way to remove the byproducts (mainly remaining starting material, di-acid and in some cases the dimer). Preferably the final product, IVA, is greater than 99% pure with less than 0.2% of the dimer present.<br>
Bv-products of Step B<br>
(III.II I) (ethyl-8-chlorooctanoate).<br>
Preferably, the ethyl-8-chlorooctanoate does not contain any dichlorohexane. It has been shown that in a sample containing up to 1 % dichlorohexane plus other byproduct, the dichlorohexane reacts with IIA to form a dimeric by-product, which is, as has be mentioned before, extremely difficult to separate out form the final acid product (IVA). Particularly preferably, ethyl-8-chlorooctanoate at &gt;99 % purity with less than 0.1 % dichlorohexane is used.<br>
Where sodium carbonate is used it must be highly pure since impure compound can lead to incomplete reaction, extended ring opening and excessive di-alkylated byproduct formation.<br>
A possible by-product is the 5-CNAC ethylester, which may be formed due to incomplete saponification or formed by esterification of the free acid during the end crystallization from ethanol/water.<br>
Further, as indicated earlier, there may be residual IA, the corresponding 5-chlorosalicyiic acid and the so-called "dimer" if more then 0.1 % dichlorhexane is present in (III.III).<br>
With 0.1 % dichlorohexane in (III.Ill) it is predicted that the dimer contamination<br><br>
could be about 0.3 % in IVA and below 0.1 % in (VA).<br>
In order to further purify (IVA), if required, an additional extraction with butylacetate after the saponification and partial neutralization may be conducted. At that stage, at pH 8-9, IVA is still water soluble (as its mono sodium salt) whereas the dimer, which cannot make a salt at this pH (no carboxylic add), may be extracted. The main drawback of this modification is that a large amount of butylacetate Is necessary to obtain a phase separation.<br>
Other potential impurities like chlorine isomers in the aromatic ring and C7, C8 homologues of the alkyl chain may theoretically be present in small quantities (less than 0.05%) but preferably are already excluded due to their control in the starting materials.<br>
In order to keep by-products to the minimum, it is preferred that, in particular, the following parameters are regulated, as hereinbefore described:<br>
•	Quality and amounts of starting materials: (IIA), (III.Ill), base (such as<br>
sodium carbonate), bromine salt (such as sodium bromide).<br>
•	Temperature of the reaction mixture and rate of sodium carbonate addition.<br>
•	Distillation of the aprotic solvent (such as DMF), and amount of strong base<br>
(e.g. sodium hydroxide) (saponification).<br>
•	Ratio ethanol/water and amount sodium hydroxide during crystallization.<br>
Furthermore, the quality and relative amounts of starting materials are important for the quality of (IVA). Too much (III.Ill) and sodium carbonate (or too little IIA) is likely to have a direct impact on the amount of di-alkyiated by-product formed, which to a certain extent is removed on the crystallization and potential rework. However a drop in the yield may also play a role in the formation of by-products, for example for about 20 % isss yield 10 % over alkylation has been observed.<br>
The present invention has therefore revised and improved the process of the prior art, and provided a "one pot" process to enable an increase the yield by as much as 20 percentage points (about 84 % versus 64 %) with equal or better purity.<br>
StepC<br><br>
(Figure Removed) <br>
Scheme 7<br>
The prior art crystallization techniques had the following disadvantages: Crystallization occurred under reflux from an emulsion (after addition of concentrated sodium hydroxide to 5-CNAC free acid in acetone) without seeding. Therefore, no control of the crystallization was possible, although it might be that a certain thermodynamic equilibrium is obtained under these crystallization conditions, preventing such a control.<br>
The present invention has provided a crystallisation technique in which the N-substituted salicylcamide (IV, IV.II and IVA) crystallises in an acetone/water mixture in the presence of an alkali metal base, especially sodium hydroxide. Independent from the reaction conditions, a poryhydrate, for example a hexahydrate, of IV, IV.II or IVA crystallizes first in the acetone/water mix, which then forms the monohydrate V or VA upon drying. Usually the wet cake contains about 12 % water which is consistent with 2-3 molecules of water per 5-CNAC molecule.<br>
Crystallization with only one equivalent water may be achieved using sodium methylate. This may give a sotvate which corresponds to a different crystal modification.<br>
Step C is itself inventive. In the preferred method steps, compound (IV.II or IVA), acetone and water are combined. The acetonerwater ratio may be from about 5:1 v/v to about 15:1 v/v, e.g. about 10:1 to 11:1. A base is added to the mixture suitably at a slightly elevated temperature, e.g. about 40°C to 60°C, for example 45°C to 55°C. Further acetone may be added, for example as an acetone/water mixture, (e.g. from 2:1 v/v to 4:1 v/v, such as 3:1 v/v), suitably keeping the temperature at a moderately elevated level (e.g. 45°C-55°C). The salt is then<br>
isolated. One procedure is as follows: if the temperature is above 50°C, it is reduced to 50°C or less (e.g 40°C to 50°C such as 45°C to 48°C) and seed crystals are added to induce crystallisation, before further reducing the temperature (e.g. to 0°C to 5°C) to finish the crystallisation step prior to Isolating the crystals. Stirring is suitably continued throughout The crystals may be dried under vacuum 50-60 mbar at 50-55°C for at least 24 hours.<br>
It was observed that crystallization and stirring which occurred at higher temperatures (40-50°C), afforded larger crystals (up to 500 micron). Further, crystallisation at about 0°C provides different crystal types to those at higher temperatures.<br>
In an alternative crystallisation process, the crystallisation is conducted from 2-pentanone at 806C.<br>
Preferably, crystallisation occurs, with seeding, at 45-50°C, followed by the addition of more acetone at the same temperature, then cooling to 0*C to give the desired polymorph. A particularly favourable polymorph is obtained by prolonged stirring over 24 h at O'C.<br>
The resulting salt, V or VA is preferably &gt; 99 % pure, without any by-product over 0.1 %.<br>
The theoretical amount of water in VA should be 4.8 % calculated for a monohydrate. In fact the water content depends of the conditions and duration of drying. At 80-100-mbar pressure and 40-55'C no over-drying occurs. However to avoid any risk it is recommended to check the water content during the drying process. Further, it appeared in some cases that the residual amount of acetone after drying was over the established limit of 0.5 %.<br>
In order to keep by-products to the minimum, it is preferred that, in particular, the following parameters are regulated, as hereinbefore described:<br>
•	The amount and quality of the alkali metal base (sodium hydroxide)<br>
•	The temperature of seeding and crystallization<br>
•	The rate of saturation<br>
•	The rate of cooling<br>
•	The time of agitation at O'C<br>
t	The drying procedure.<br>

The process of the present invention will now be further described in the following examples for the synthesis of 5-CNAC:<br>
Examples<br>
Example 1: Preparation of 6-chloro-2H-1.3-benzoxazlne-2.4(3H)-dione<br><br>
(Figure Removed)	<br>
5-chlorosalicylamide (300 g, 1.75 mo!) and water (900 ml) were placed in a 3 litre, 4-neck round-bottomed flask under a nitrogen atmosphere and stirred. 5-ethyl-2-methyl-pyridine (284 g, 2.27 mol) and n-butyl acetate (900 ml) were added to the mixture. The mixture was cooled to 0-5°C (jacket - 10°C) and dropwise addition of ethyl chloroformate (233 g, 2.10 mol) was started. This addition continued over a period of approximately one hour. When the addition was completed, the reaction<br>
mixture was slowly heated (in about two hours) to reflux and kept under reflux for an additional period of about 5 hours Oacket 110°C, internal temperature (IT) 90°C). The resulting slurry was allowed to cool to room temperature, and hydrochloric acid (28 ml, 37 % m/m, 0.34 mo!) was added and the mixture stirred for about 30 minutes. The resulting slurry was vacuum filtered, the filter cake was washed with n-butyl acetate followed by water (600 ml) and was allowed to dry overnight in vacuoat60°C. 321 g (93%) of 6-chloro-2H-1I3-benzoxazine-2,4(3H)-dlone (6-chloro carsalam) was isolated after drying.<br>
Example 2: Preparation of A/-5-fchtorosalicvlovl)-8-aminocaprvlic acid f5-CNAC1<br><br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
6-chloro-2H-1,3-benzoxazlne-2,4(3H)-dione (180.5 g, 0.91 mol), sodium bromide (18.7 g, 0.18 mot) and dimethylformamide (840 ml) were placed in a 3 litre, 4-neck round bottomed flask under a nitrogen atmosphere and stirred. Ethyl-8-chloro-octanoate (188.3 g, 0.911 mol) was added in one portion, and rinsed with dimethylformamide (60 ml). The mixture was heated up to 100-105°C (jacket 120°C) and anhydrous sodium carbonate (51.7 g, 0.47 mol) was added portion wise over a period of 2 hours. After the reaction was complete, the solvent was distilled off under reduced pressure (60-20 mbar, internal temperature 75-120'C, jacket 100-130'C) to leave an oily residue. Water (700 ml) was added at 85-95eC over 10-20 minutes, followed by sodium hydroxide (380 ml, 30 % w/w), followed by a rinse with 20ml of water. The mixture was stirred for two hours at 85-100°C, then sulfuric acid (60 ml 50 % w/w) was added at 60-65°C until the pH of the mixture was between 8 and 9 then ethyl acetate (700 ml) was added at 60-65*C over 30 to 60 minutes. Then more sulfuric acid (221 ml, 50 % w/w) was added at 60-65°C over a period of one hour until the pH of the mixture was between 2 and 3.5. Afterwards the two phases were allowed to separate. The aqueous phase was discarded, and<br><br>
the remaining organic phase washed with water (300-360 ml) at 60-65°C. Then water (600 ml) and sodium hydroxide (10.8 g, 30 % w/w and 40 ml of water), followed by a rinse of 20ml of water, were added (in order to remove small about of N,O5-(chlorosalicyloy!)-di-octanoicacid by-product), and the organic solvent distilled off under atmospheric pressure (jacket 110-120'C, IT: 80-100°C). To the resulting suspension, ethanol (1500 ml) was added at 50-65°C. The clear solution was allowed to cool down to 40-45'C and seed crystals (0.12 g) were added and the solution stirred for 20 to 30 minutes until crystallisation was set on. Cooling was continued down to 0-5°C in a period of 1-2 hours. The solid was collected by vacuum filtration and washed with ethanol/water 7:3 (540 ml), and dried under vacuum (10-50 mbar) at 60BC overnight to yield 237 g of A/-5-(chlorosalicyloyI)-8-aminocapryiic add (84 %).<br>
Example 3: Preparation of the di-sodlum salt, monohvdrate of N-5-(chlorosalicvlovl)-8-aminocaprvlic acid<br>
W-5-(chlorosalicyloyl)-8-aminocaprylic acid (3.5 kg, 11.15 mol), acetone (9450 ml) and water (875 ml, purified) were placed in a 50 litre vessel under a nitrogen atmosphere and stirred at 45-55'C (jacket 60°C) until a clear solution was formed (20 to 30 minutes). Sodium hydroxide (297 g, 30 % w/w, 22.3 mol) was added in such a way as to maintain the temperature at 45-55°C, followed by a solution of acetone/water 3:1 v/v (1050 ml). The hot (50°C) solution was passed then over a polishing filter and the filtrate transferred to another clean vessel and heated to 45 to 55°C. The transfer line was rinsed with hot (45-55'C) acetone/water 3:1 v/v (1050 ml), and then acetone (about 10.5 litre) was added in such a way to keep the temperature around 45-55°C (jacket 55°C). Then, the temperature was lowered to 45-48"C and seed crystals (4 g) were added. The mixture was stirred for about 20-30 minutes to obtain a fine suspension and induce crystallization, then more acetone (281) was added over one hour in such a way to maintain a temperature of 45-50'C (jacket 55°C). Afterwards, a slow stirring was prolonged for one hour at 45-50°C, then the temperature was lowered to 0-5°C over a period of two hours. Stirring was continued at 0-5'C for an hour, then crystals were collected by centrifugation, washed with cold acetone/water 95:5 v/v (7 I) and dried under vacuum 50-60 mbar at 50-55'C for at least 24 hours to yield 4.19 kg of 5-CNAC di-sodium monohydrate (95 % yield).<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
