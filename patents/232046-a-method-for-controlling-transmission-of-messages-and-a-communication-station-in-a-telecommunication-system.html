				<td>The present invention relates to a method for controlling transmission of messages and a communication station in a telecommunication system.<br>
The present invention relates to a method and an apparatus for transmitting messages in mobile communication systems, particularly control of transmission of messages between mobile communication stations and fixed location communi-cation stations in a mobile 'telephone system.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
Modern mobile telephone systems have, in addition to supp-orting transmissions that are critical with respect to real-time, such as e.g. voice-calls, the ability to convey non real-time critical messages to and from mobile communication stations. Typical examples are the so-called Shore Message Service in the GSM system and the possibility to send and receive fax and electronic mail messages with a mobile telephone.<br>
When incorporating more and more capabilities for non real-time critical message transfer in mobile communication net-works, it is necessary to incorporate easy-to-use functions for keeping track of outgoing and incoming messages. Since radio communication in a mobile communication network is impaired by many factors, such as changes in signal strength, multipath fading, user switching off the equipment etc., transfer is often interrupted for shorter or longer time periods. In an environment with many interruptions of communication, a user of present technology in mobile communication stations must constantly monitor the progress of transmission of each and every message. If contact is lost for even a short period of time during the trans-<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, there is provided A method in a telecommunication system for controlling transmission of messages from a first communication station to a second communication station, said first communication station, said method comprising the steps of: generating at least one message text in the first communication station ; generating an information block associated with the message; said method characterized by also comprising the steps: generating in said information block a transmission time stamp said time stamp comprising information about a point in time when the message is to be transmitted;<br>
comparing the transmission time stamp with current time, said comparison generating at least one result;<br>
interpreting the result of the comparison and as a consequence of the<br>
interpretation commencing a transmission of the message from the first<br>
communication station	to the second communication station<br>
generating in said information block a transmission status indicator, said status indicator having information about the amount of transmitted message content and/or comprising information about actions to perform in an even of transmission interruption.<br>
generating in said information block a transmission status indicator, said status indicator having information about the amount of transmitted message content and/or comprising information about actions to perform in an even of transmission interruption.<br>
A statement of the problem, in general cerrns, addressed by the present invention is how to facilitate the control of when a message is transmitted to or from a mobile communi-cation station. Particularly the problem is how to control and monitor transmission of multiple non real-time critical messages in situations when transmission is prematurely interrupted.<br>
Within the scope of the general problem, as stated above, a number of sub-problems can be identified. Initially, there is a problem of how to supply a user of a mobile communi-cation station with an ability .o preset a time for trans-mission of a message, freeing the user from further inter-action until the message has been transmitted. Secondly, there is a problem of supplying the user with an ability to enable and disable automatic transmission of messages that have preset times for transmission and also enabling the user to change the time of transmission.<br>
The present invention addresses the problems as described above, having a purpose of facilitating control and monitor-ing of non-voice message transmission in a mobile communi-cation system. Mo particular preference is expressed with respect to the type of communication system. The invention can be applied in digital systems such as, for example, GSM, PCS, D-AMPS or CDMA systems, as well as analog systems such as AMPS, TACS and NMT<br>
The invention is realized by methods and means to create and edit information blocks associated with the messages, coget-her with methods and means to monitor and control trans-mission of the messages.<br>
A method according to the invention relates t transmission of messages from a first communication station to a second communication station. The first communication, station is capable of controlling transmission, capable of, keeping track of current time, capable of message generation and capable of transmitting. At least one message containing textual data is generated in the first communication station together with an information block which is associated with the message. An inventive method comprises a step of<br>
generating in said information block a transmission time stamp, said time stamp comprising information about a point in time when the message is to be transmitted. In another step a comparison of the transmission time stamp with the current time is made, followed by an interpretation of the result of the comparison and as a consequence of the interpretation commencing a transmission of the message from the first communication station to the second communication station. Editing of the information block is also possible.<br>
An advantage of the invention is that it is possible for a user of a communication suction to create messages, store the messages along with information about when the message is to be transmitted, and then leave the responsibility of transmission of the messages to the communication station in accordance with the inventive method and means.<br>
Preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be described in detail, referring to drawings as specified below.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION 0? PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Figure i shows one example of a telecommunication system 1 			 in which the present invention can be implemented. Figure 1 will serve as a reference in the following description of embodiments of the invention. It should be noted, thoug that by no means is an implementation of the present inven-tion restricted to the system 1 exemplified in figure 1. Telecommunication systems in general comprises many more components than those shown in figure 1. Only those compo-nents needed to illustrate the normal function of the system and the iinvention have been included. Also, no restiction is intended in terms of standards. It is implementable in any standard of mobile telecommunication systems, such as e.g. GSM and AMPS/D-AMPS wheee a message service exist.<br>
The telecommunication system 1 comprises two parts: a mobile telecommunication systen FLMN and a fixed station system PSTN. The mobile system part PLMT comprises a switching center MSC1 to which two radio base: station controllers BSC1.BSC2 are connected, a first controller BSCi and a second controller ESC2. The base station controllers BSC1, BSC2 each have connected to them two radio base stations RBS1.RBS4 and RBS2,RBS3 respectively. The first RBS1 ana the fourth RBS4 station are connected to the first<br>
base station controller BSC1, and the second RBS2 and the chird RBS3 station are connected to the second base station controller BSC2. The mobile system also comprises a number of mobile communication stations, a first mobile station MS1 and a second mobile station MS2. The mobile stations MS1,MS2 can be of any type, e.g. simple hand-held mobile phones as indicated by the first mobile station MS1, and of more elaborate configuration as indicated by the second mobile station, to which a computer PC2 is connected.<br>
Connected to the mobile system PLMN is the fixed station system PSTN. The systems PLMN,PSTN are connected via the mobile switching center MSC in the mobile network PLMN and a fixed system switching center EX1. To the fixed switching center EX1 a number of subscriber stations B1,B2 are connec-ted. A typical example oi a subscriber stacion is a tele-phone. However, also in the fixed system PSTN, a subscriber station B3 can be of mere elaborate configuration, such as the station B3 which has a computer PC3 connected to it .<br>
Connections between the different units in the teiecom-raunication system 1 are implemented using techniques known in the art, and can very depending on what communication standards are used in the systems. The first mobile station MS1 is in contact with the first radio base station RBS1 through two rsdio channels U1,D1. A first mobile section up-channel U1 which carries information from "he fir;v:: mobile .station MB1 to the first base station RBS1 and a first mobile station down channel D1 which carries information to the first mobile station MS1 from the first base station RBS1. The channels U1,D1 can be implemented as different radio carrier frequencies, such as in the AMPS and the NMT standards. The channels U1,D1 can also be implemented in digital systems as time slots, or parts of time slots, in<br>
systems comprising time division multiplex (TDMA) such as GSM and D-AMPS, or in CDMA channels. Similarly, the connections between the second mobile station MS2 and the second radio base station RBS2 are implemented in a second up-channel U2 and a second down-channel D2.<br>
The connections between the base stations RBS1-RBS4 and their respective base station controller BSC1 and BSC2, as well as the connections between all other units in the sys-tem 1, are implemented using well known telecommunication techniques, are outside the scope of this disclosure, and will hence not be discussed further.<br>
Naturally, the number of mobile stations that	can be served<br>
by the mobile system PLMN, and the number	of subscriber<br>
stations connected to the fixed system PSTN	are generally<br>
much higher than the numbers shown here.<br>
The present invention discloses how flow of information, in a form of non-voice messages, to and from the mobile communication stations K31,MS2 is controlled in -rder to gain the advantages as described above.<br>
In the following, a terminology will be used where references to messages will cor prise all non real-time crit-ical types of messages. Exampiesa of messages in this cate-gory are: fax messages, electronic mail messages, data files containing text, images or sounds. In contrast to these (non real-time critical) messages there are transmissions that are critical with respect to real-time transfer. The most common example being an ordinary voice call from one subscriber to another in a network. Thus, the two different types of information transfer discussed in the following description will be messages and voice calls respectively.<br>
Figure 2 discloses, schematically, two communication stat-ions, a primary communication station 100 and a secondary communication station 200. Referring back to figure 1, the first mobile station MS1 can have the characteristics of the primary station 100, but there is no direct equivalence between the two. Rather, the primary station 100 as it will be disclosed, can be seen as a "generic" mobile communica¬tion station, capable of handling non-voice messages in a mobile telecommunication system. The dashed box bounding the different units in the primary station 100 indicates that it is a grouping of individual functional units that make up the station 100. It is not necessary for the units to be within a single physical casing or box.<br>
The secondary station 200 in figure 2 is also a grouping of functional units, not necessarily in the same physical loca-tion. A typical implementation can be that the units of the secondary station is divided between the base stations RBS1-RBS4, the base station centrollers BSC1,BSC2 and the mobile switching center MSC1, as will be discussed more in detail below.<br>
The primary station 100 comprises four major units that are in connection with each other: a primary radio unit 101 with an antenna 102, a primary control unit 103, a primary memory unit 104 and a primary input/output unit 105. The primary input/output unit 105 has connected to it four separate sub-units: a keypad 106, a display 107, a microphone 108 and a loudspeaker 109. Although the keypad 106 arid the display 107 are shown as separate units, they can of course be combined into one single unit such as e.g. a "touch screen". It should also be pointed out that these input/output sub-units, keypad 106, display 107, microphone and speaker 108 are merely examples of arrangements for input/output. Other<br>
types of units, performing the functions of conveying external input and output to the station 100, are easily implemented by a person skilled in the art.<br>
The secondary station 200 also comprises four major units that are in connection with each other: a secondary radio unit 201 with a secondary -antenna 202, a secondary control unit 203, a secondary memory unit 204 and a secondary input/output unit 205. The secondary input/output unit 205 is connected to the mobile switching center MSC1. Although figure 2 indicates that the mobile switching center MSC1 is separated from the secondary communication station 200, some or all the parts of the secondary station 200 can be physi-cally located in the switching center MSC1, as discussed above.<br>
Between the two communication stations 100,200 is a radio connection 42 comprising the above mentioned up- and down-channels Ul,U2,D1,B2. The radio connection 42 can also comprise one or more control channels through which signaling information is. exchanged by the communication stations 100,200. Techniques for implementing the radio connection 42 is well known in the art, and will not be dis-cussed here.<br>
Figure 3 illustrates schematicall a memory unit 300. A physical implementation of a memory unit 3CO, such as the memory units 104,204 in the primary and secondary stations 100,200 described above, car. be made using technicians known in the art. The purpose of illustrating a memory unit 300 is to exemplify contents of the memory 300. As will be desc-ribed below, the memory 300 can hold message text blocks 301,303,305,307,309 and message information blocks 302,304,<br>
306,308,310. One message text block 309 and one information block 310 will now be discussed in more detail.<br>
The  message  text  block  309  contains  text  information, suitably coded in e.g. binary format.  The text 309 can represent any form of non-voice data and be of arbitrary length, limited only by the phycical limits of the memory 300. As discussed above, the message may contain simple text as well as e.g. files containing coded images and sounds. In the following,  the text block 309 represents all these examples of information that is possible to represent as textual information. The information block 310 contains a message size measure 311, a time stamp 312 and an transfer status block 313. The size measure 311 is preferably an integer number, stored in a suitably ceded format  repre-senting the size of the text block 309. The time scamp 312 is a number, also stored in a suitably coded format, repre-senting a point in time when the message text 309 is trans¬mitted  from  or  to  the  communication  station  100.  The transfer status  block  313  contains  in format ion  about  a destination address of the message, as will as an indication of whether or not the mesage has been successfully trans-ferred to the address. The transfer sratus biock 313 may also hold information about actions to take in an event of transmission failure due to e.g. a user switching oil the communication station 100.  One example of  on action is automatic re-transmission of the message at a  srtain moment in time, calculated from the informat ion in the time stamp 312. Another action that can. be representec by information in the transfer status block 313 is to automatically re-transmit the message as soon as the station 100 is switched on after having been switched off. The destination 313 can be a suitable sequence of digits representing the desti-nation, and can be of any format previously known in the<br>
art. A typical example is a telephone number to a subscriber in the communication system I. The part of the transfer status block 313 representing the indication of successful transfer can simply be a flag with the binary values TRUE and FALSE as representing transferred and not-transferred, respectively. Similarly, information about actions to take in the event of interrupted transfer may simply be in the form of an integer number, representing different actions when interpreted by the control unit of the station 100,200.<br>
Returning to figure 2, the function of the different units will now be described. It will be assumed that the primary station 100 is operated by a user and can e.g. be repre¬sented by the first mobile station MS1 in the mobile system PLMN shown in figure 1. The radio unit 201 and the antenna 202 of the secondary station 200 is implemented in the first base station RBS1, and the secondary control unit 203, memory 204 and input/output unit 205 are implemented in the mobile switching center MSC1.<br>
A message is generated by interaction between the user and the primary station through the keypad :106 and the display 107. The user generates the message text 309 and -tores the text in the primary memory 104. This message text generation is preferably done by typing on the keypad 106. The primary control unit 103 controls all interaction between the different units, such as the input of text on the keypad 106 through the input/output unit 105. The actual transfer of the text into the primary memory 104 is also controlled by the control unit 103. However, pre-stored text from the memory 104 can also be used. An example being a file of digitally coded sound or a digital image. The time stamp 312 in the information block 310 is also created by interaction through the keypad 106 and display 107, controlled by the<br>
control unit 103. The simplest form of time stamp 312 is a number of digits representing the time of day, such as e.g. 08.45AM or 22.45. However, suitably designed information presentation technique, known in the art, allows the user to simply select predetermined time stamps from e.g. a menu on the display. The control unit 103 is also capable of keeping track of current time. That is, the control unit 103 comprises a clock circuit. However, a clock circuit" is not explicitly shown in the figures, since a clock circuit is a feature well known in the art, and need not be described farther. The size measure 311 is preferably calculated by the control unit 103 and stored in the information block 310 without user interaction.<br>
The massage text 309 is transmitted from the primary station<br>
100 via the primary radio unit 1C1 and its antenna 102 to<br>
the secondary station 200 with its antenna 202 and radio<br>
unit 201. As indicated above, the actual way of transfering<br>
is known in the art and takes place through the radio connection and may also include transfer of signaling information which is also known in the art.<br>
when received in the secondary station 2CO, the message text<br>
109 is stored in the secondary memory 204. Similar to the<br>
cution in the primary station 100, t s secondary control<br>
unit 203 controls all  interaction between units  in the<br>
secondry station 200.  Depending on the situation,  the<br>
message text 309 can be transferred from the secondary<br>
memory 204 further in the communication system 1, via e.g.<br>
the mobile switching center MSC1. However, that is outside<br>
the scope of this description and will not be discussed<br>
further.<br>
Figure 4 shows a third alternative of an implementation of a communication station 400. The third station 400 comprises a third radio unit 401 with its antenna 402. a third control unit 403 and a third input/output unit 405. Connected to this third station 400 is a computer 450 comprising a computer input/output unit 455, a computer control unit 453 and a computer memory unit 454.<br>
Figure 5 shows a fourth alternative of an implementation of a communication station 500. The fourth station 500 comprises a fourth radio unit 501 with its antenna 502, a fourth control unit 503, a fourth memory unit 504 and a fourth input/output unit 505. Connected to this fourth station 500 is a second computer 550 comprising a second computer input/output unit 555 and a second computer control unit 553.<br>
The examples in figure 4 and 5 illustrate that it is not necessary that a communication station has all functions in one single physical unit. It is possible to have stations consisting of two or more separate units 400,450 and 500,550 respectively. Between the units 400,450 and 500,550 are connections 460 and 560 respectively. Although shown as physical connections 460,560 it is of course within the Known art to implement these connections 460,560 as e.g. radio connections over an air interface.<br>
with reference to figures 6 to 9 and figures 1,2 and 3, embodiments of methods according to the invention will now be described. First, a method of controlling transfer of messages from a mobile communication station MS_,100 to a communication station 200 residing in the network PLMN, will be described. Next, referring to figure 1 and 8, follows a description of a method of controlling transfer of messages<br>
that have been interrupted during transmission. A. method of controlling transfer of messages from a station residing in the network PLMM to a mobile communication station MS2,100 will then be described with reference to figure 9.<br>
The methods will be described in functional terms and are preferably implemented as software running in the control units 103,203 of the stations 100,200. This means that steps in the methods comprising an action such as pressing of a key on a keypad, does not imply that it is the actual pres-sing that initiates the desired action. Rather, a pressing of a key on a keypad should be interpreted as an action which sends a signal to the software program running in the respective control unit and by that initiating the desired action.<br>
It should be pointed ou that the methods, as they will be described below, only implicitly describe signaling proce-dures between the communication stations that are involved. Explicit and detailed descriptions signaling procelures are outside the scope of this invention. All necessary signaling procedures neceessary for implementing the inven-tion are known in the art although variations in implemen-tations exist between different telecommunication systems. However, a simplified an schematic ascription of signaling between stations will be described, in connection with the second method, as shown in figure 8.<br>
Figure 6 illustrates a method comprising the steps:<br>
- In step 601 a message is created by a user of the mobile station MS1,100. As well as creating the text block 309, the user specifies the time stamp 312 which determines at which point in time the message is to be sent. The time stamp 312 can be a number such as e.g. 6.45AM and 22.10. The size<br>
measure 311 in the information clock 310 is preferably not input by the user, rather, it is calculated, and stored in the information block by the control unit 103. In practical terms the creation of the message is made by the user interacting with the mobile station through the keypad 106 and the display 107. A further detailed description of the keypad- and display interaction is unnecessary here since it is already very well known in the art. However, it should be pointed out that typing a message does not necessarily mean that each and every character of the text block 309, or information block 310, must be typed one by one. Message text and information may be already present in the mobile station MS,100, and simply recalled by pressing a single or a few keys on the keypad 106.<br>
-	In step 602 a choice is made, whether to create another<br>
message or not. In practice this can be done, as known in<br>
the art, by pressing a key on the keypad 105.<br>
-	In step 603 at least part of massage is displayed on<br>
the display 107 of the mobile station,Depending on the type<br>
of display, more or less of the message content is disp-<br>
layed. Even if only part of the message, text block 309 and<br>
information block 310, can be displayed at the same time, it<br>
is within the framework of known art to enaole the user to<br>
see the whole message by, e.g., pressing a key on the keypad<br>
106. At least part of the information block 310 is displayed<br>
as well, and as for the text block 209,  the individual<br>
blocks 311,312,313 ci  the  information block 310  can be<br>
displayed individually or together by, e . c . , pressing a key<br>
on the keypad 106.<br>
-	In step 604 the user edits at least part of the message.<br>
The user changes the contents of the time stamp block 312,<br>
which after the editing contains new information about when the message is to be sent.<br>
- Step 605 is a waiting step. The present method does not prescribe any particular activity taking place during this step. An example of activity can be that the user of the station 100 establishes a voice connection with another subscriber in the network 1. Another example is that the station 100 is deactivated or switched off, an action well known in the art. The length of the waiting time period is also not dictated by the present method, and can thus be either short or long.<br>
In step 606 the control unit 103 of the station 100 compares the time stamp 212 with current time. If the com¬parison results in that current time is equal to the time stamp, the method continues with step 607. If the comparison results in that the tims stamp 212 is larger than current time, the method returns to the v. siting step 605. If the comparison results in that the time stamp 312 is less than current time, the method returns to the display step 603.<br>
In step 607 the massage is sent to the destination determined by the contents of the transfer status block 313.<br>
Although the above described method refers only to one mes-sage, it is obvious that, more than one message car. be hand-led as described.<br>
Figure 7 shows a flowchart of a second embodiment of a method according to the invention. A method of controlling transfer of messages is shown, including steps handling an interruption of message transfer. A realistic setting for this method is when a user of a mobile station MS1 creates one (or more) messages, at least one of which messages is<br>
comparably large in size and thus may take a sizable amount<br>
of time to transfer. The masaage has been associated with<br>
the time stamp 312 as dusclosed in connection with figure 3<br>
and 6. In order to enable the user to make an ordinary<br>
voice-call before the massage is transferred, the large<br>
massage has been allocated the time stamp 312 denoting<br>
transmission at a larer time, automatically controlled by the controlled by<br>
the control unit 103 in the station MS1. Also, the<br>
destination block 313 will  contain information to the effect<br>
that if a transmission is prematurely terminated, automatic<br>
transfer attempts will be made at regular intervals. During<br>
the ensuing transmission of the large massage, teh user is<br>
forcedto abruptly swich off the mobile station MS1, and<br>
wait some time before being able to switch it on again. When<br>
the station MS1 is switched on again, the information stored<br>
in the destination block 313 will lead to a re-transmission<br>
commencing. However, the user has to make an uragent voice-<br>
call that can not wait until the (large) massage has been<br>
transferred, and decides to instruct the station MS1 not to<br>
continue the massage transfer until the voice-call has<br>
terminated. Hence, the user edits the information in the<br>
destination block 313, When the voice-call is terminated,<br>
the control unit 103 automatically begins begins a re-transmission<br>
of the message.<br>
With refernce to figure 7, a method in accordance with the<br>
invention, following the scenario described above, comprises<br>
the steps:<br>
- In step 701 a massage is created bu a user of the mobile<br>
station MS1,100. The text block 309 if  the message is<br>
composed of previouisly recorded and digitally coded sound<br>
data stored in the station 100. using technique in the<br>
art. The user also specifies the time stamp 312 which<br>
determines at which point in time the massage is to be sent.<br>
The size measure 311 is calculated and stored in the<br>
information block 310 by the control unit 103. The<br>
information in the destination block 313 regarding actions<br>
in case of interrupted transfer is also input. By selecting<br>
from, e.g .,a menu on the desplay 107 the action chosen is<br>
to automatically re-transmit any message which is inter-<br>
rupted as a result of switching off the station 100. The re-<br>
transsission will take place at the earliest pollible moment<br>
in time whin the station 100 is switched on again.<br>
- In step 702 a choice is made that no more massages are to<br>
be created.<br><br>
-  Step 703 us a waiting step, during which the user of the<br>
mobile stat6ion MS1 is making an ordinary voice-call. The<br>
designation as a waiting step has been made in order to<br>
clarify that the actulal waiting is in the context of massage<br>
transfer, Any event outside the scope of the invention. may<br>
of course also take place during thind step.<br>
In step 704 the time stamp 312 associated with the message<br>
coincide with the time as recorded by the control unit 103<br>
of the station 100. This leads to a commencement of message<br>
transmission.<br><br>
-In step 705 the ongoing massage transfer is interrupted by<br>
the user, who switches off at least the radio unit 101 in<br>
the communication station MS1,100<br><br>
- Step 706 is a waiting step. No limit on the duration of<br>
this step is dedtated by the invention. Any duration is<br>
conceivable, from momentary interruptions of second or<br>
less, up to a duration of several daus of more.<br>
-	Step 707 is a step in which the user elects, immediately<br>
after having switched on the communication station MSI, to<br>
display at least part of the message information block 309.<br>
This step 707 is analogous to step 603 in the previous<br>
example.<br>
-	During step 708 the user edits the information block 309,<br>
in order to temporarily prevent transmission of the message.<br>
As described above, this action may in practical terms mean<br>
one or a few keypad actions.<br>
-	Step 709 is a waiting step similar to step 703, during<br>
which step 709 an ordinary call is made by the user.<br>
In step 710, after the ordinary call is terminated, message transfer is automatically continued. As mentioned above, the control of exactly when the continuation of the message transfer is by means of software running in the control unit 101.<br>
In figure 8 can be seen a simplified signalirg diagram showing signaling sequences 801-810 between a mobile unit MS, a radio base station E " and a switching center MSC. The<br>
20 mobile station MS is in this context a first coirmuru-cation station 100, and the base station BS and the switching center MSC together acts as a second communication station 200, as shown in figure 2. The radio unit 201 in the second station 200 is located in the base station 3S, whereas the<br>
2r- remaining units in the second station 200 is located in the switching center MSC.<br>
The signaling sequences 801-810 are not iescribed in detail,<br>
only directions of transfer and relative order is shown. All<br>
specific details regarding signaling between units in a<br>
3t'  system PLMN is already well known in the art. Hence, to<br><br>
emphasize that the invention is applicable in any type of <br>
system, such as e. g. GSM and AMPS/D-AMPS, PDC etc., <br>
information about implementation of e.g. logical and<br>
physical channels, coding, schemes and transfer rates is <br>
omitted. All omitted details are assumed to be known fo the <br>
person in the art. <br><br>
- Signal sequence 801 is a connection set-up sequence. A<br>
connection is set up between the mobile station station MS and the<br>
801 is shown as taking place at one instant in time. with <br>
signaling in directions both from and to the <br>
parricipating<br>
units MS,BS and MSC. However, depending on implementation, <br>
this sstep 801 may of course comprise many more sub-<br>
sequences, with signaling taking place over a period of<br>
 time.<br><br>
- Signal sequence 802 illustrates transfer of message<br>
information from the mobile station MS to the switching<br>
 center MSC.<br><br>
-Signal sequence 803 shows that the switching center MSC<br>
acknowledges receipt of the information transferred in the <br>
prenious sequence 802.<br><br>
The above described three sequence 801-802 take place <br>
during the first transfer 7.<br><br>
- The detted line 804 represents the combined waiting steps <br>
706 abd 709 as described above. <br><br>
- Signal sequence 805 represents a re- establishment of<br>
connection between the station MS,BS,MSC. This sewuence 805<br>
is identical to sequence 801 described above.<br>
Signal sequences 806 to 809 represent message transfer<br>
sequences 806,803 and receipt aknowledge sequences 806-809.<br>
Together with sequence 805 these sequences 806-809 take<br>
place during step 710 as described above in connection with<br>
figure 7.<br>
-	Signal sequence 610 is a connection termination sequence which, similar to set-up sequences 801 and 805, may compurise several sub-sequences.<br>
-	Figure 9  illustrates a third method according to the<br>
invention, where message transfer takes place in an opposite <br>
direction as compared to the previous examples. An message is<br>
present in the secondry station 200. Associated with the <br>
massage is the information block 310, as in the privous<br>
examples, comprising information about when in time the <br>
message text 309 is to be transferred to the mobile station<br>
MS,100.<br><br>
The method comprises the steps:<br><br>
-In step 901 the ingtormation block 310 of the message is <br>
transferred from the sedond station 200 tio the first station<br>
100. It is outside the scope of the invention to describe<br>
connection setup, and it is assumed that persons skilled in <br>
the art comrehend setup procedures. It is also within the <br>
realm of known art that the transfer of at least part of the <br>
message information block 310 may coincide with a connedtion <br>
settup procedure, although it is also posible that infor-<br>
mation block 310 transfer may take place as a separate step <br>
after connection setup. <br>
In step 902 the message information block 310, or at least<br>
part of it , is desplayed on the display unit 107 of the <br>
furst communication station.<br>
-In step 903 a user of the  first station  100 selects<br>
whether or not the message tex	 309of the ,message, should<br>
be transferred or not. Alorg the 1 lines of orevic is examples, the user may have several choices of when the message text 309 is tc be transferred. The user may decide that immediete transfer is to be preferred, or he may select a later time to transfer the text 309. In any case, the user makes a selection which is input t to the station 100 in the form of e.g. a menu selection. as doscussed above.In this<br>
transfet of the message text 309<br><br>
-In step 904 an order is sent to the second station 200<br>
instructing the sesond station to take action according to<br>
the selection which was made in the previous step 903.<br><br>
-In step 905 the first station receives the massage text<br>
stnt by the second station 2000.<br><br>
This third example of message transfer also comprises<br>
signaling sequences similar to those posible above in<br>
connection with figure 8. It is also possible to conceive<br>
orher examples where message transfer from the second<br>
station 200 to the esamples described above, and by<br>
that finding support for the scope of the following claims.<br><br><br><br>
