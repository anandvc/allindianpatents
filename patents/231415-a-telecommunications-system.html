				<td>The invention relates to a telecommunications system for restricting the access of any one of a plurality mobile terminal<br>
units to a telecommunications network as a function of at least one of predefined oriterions such as time, destination and<br>
duration of the call.<br>
The invention relates also to a telecommunications<br>
network of a first unit of a telecommunications system, to which<br>
access being managed by a second unit of said telecommunications<br>
system, and said telecommunications system including an<br>
authentication procedure of said first unit by said second unit.<br>
The invention likewise relates particularly to a<br>
telecommunications system comprising at least a first and a second<br>
unit, said second unit notably including means for managing the<br>
access of said first unit to a telecommunications network, and<br>
authentication means of said first unit.<br>
The invention finally relates as a central unit of<br>
a telecommunications system comprising at least one other unit<br>
whose access to a telecommunications network has to be managed by<br>
said central unit including authentication means of said first unit.<br>
The invention has highly significant applications in<br>
the field of telecommunications, notably within the scope of the<br>
DECT standard for professional or private PABX applications.<br>
The abstract of Japanese Patent Application JP-A-05<br>
014 489 describes a circuit which permits of restricting the access<br>
for incoming or outgoing calls as a function of the respective<br>
time range.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to propose<br>
a telecommunication system and a simple procedure arranged, for<br><br>
permitting the restriction of the access as a function of a large<br>
variety of criterions without the necessity of the use of specific<br>
means. By way of example, the invention premits of restricting<br>
the access to a telecommunications network as a function of time,<br>
destination of the call, its duration etc.<br>
Therefore, a system according to the invention of<br>
restricting access to a telecommunications network and a process<br>
as defined above are characterized in that the system comprises<br>
the implementation of said authentication procedure.<br>
The invention is thus particularly advantageous in<br>
notably all the mobile telecommunications systems in which user<br>
authentication procedures are defined.<br>
Thus the invention relates to a telecommunication<br>
system comprising a base unit linked to the public telecommunication<br>
network by a cable, and a plurality of mobile terminal units each<br>
communicating with the base unit by radio, characterized in that<br>
the system is arranged for restricting the access of any of said<br>
mobile terminal units to the network as a function of at least<br>
one of predefined criterions such as time, destination, duration<br>
of the call, by assigning a specific code called "access code"<br>
to said criterions and using said access code as a key v/hich,<br>
applied to an authentication procedure, such as herein stated,<br>
permits of determining the rights of any of said mobile terminal<br>
units in relation to said criterions.<br><br>
For restricting said access as a function of at least one predefined<br>
criterion, in a particularly advantageous embodiment the process according to the invention<br>
notably comprises assigning a code called access code to each of these criterions and it uses<br>
said access code as a key which, applied to said authentication procedure, permits of<br>
determining the rights of said first unit in relation to said criterion.<br>
By way of example, a process according to the invention notably<br>
comprises:<br>
transmitting an authentication request from said second unit to said first unit,<br>
calculating a first and a second authentication result at the level of said<br>
respective first and second units, by utilizing said access code as a key, said access code<br>
previously being entered by a user at the level of said first unit,<br>
transmitting said first result from said first unit to said second unit,<br>
comparing said first and second results at the level of said second unit to<br>
determine whether said first unit has right of access in relation to said criterion.<br>
The process according to the invention is applied notably in an<br>
advantageous manner to the DECT standard defined by ETSI (European Telecommunications<br>
Standard Institute). In this case, it advantageously implements the procedure called "user<br>
authentication" defined in the part GAP (Generic Access Profile; ETSI 300444) of this<br>
standard.<br>
A standardized use of such a process within the scope of a mobile<br>
telephony standard offers the additional advantage of permitting an interoperability between<br>
mobile units and base units from different manufacturers.<br>
These and other aspects of the invention will be apparent from and<br>
elucidated with reference to the embodiments described hereinafter.<br>
In the accompanying drawings:<br>
-	Fig. 1 represents an example of a telecommunications system according<br>
to the invention,<br>
-	Fig. 2 represents a simplified diagram explaining the operation of the<br>
"user authentication" procedure of the DECT standard, and<br>
-	Fig. 3 represents an example of an access restriction process according<br>
to the invention.<br><br>
In the following of the description, a process and a system according to<br>
the invention will be described within the scope of the DECT mobile telephony standard<br>
defined by ETSI. However, the invention is applicable to any other telecommunications<br>
system having a user authentication procedure (CT2, GSM, ETACS, TETRA ...).<br>
According to Fig. 1, a telecommunications system according to the<br>
invention comprises, installed inside a dwelling 0 or an office, for example, a base unit 1<br>
linked to the public telecommunications network 2 by a cable 3, and a plurality of mobile<br>
terminal units 4 inside the building 0 and communicating with the base unit by radio. Such<br>
systems are notably described in the article entitled "The complete solution for cordless<br>
access", published in "Philips Telecommunication Review", Vol. 52, No. 3, January 1995.<br>
The invention notably relates to the restriction of access of units 4 to the<br>
telecommunications network 2 as a function of predefined criterions. By way of example,<br>
these criterions are notably the time of the call, its destination, its duration .... For example,<br>
for professional applications, the access to the network is likely to be restricted to certain<br>
time ranges corresponding to the normal hours in which staff is present. It is also likely to be<br>
restricted to certain countries. For domestic applications, for example, the process according<br>
to the invention notably permits of checking the duration of calls.<br>
In this example, the base unit 1 plays the role of second unit and the<br>
mobile units 4 play the role of first units.<br>
In Fig. 2 is described in a diagram the authentication procedure provided<br>
in the part GAP of the DECT standard (ETSI 300444). This authentication procedure is<br>
provided in the standard to permit the authentication of a user for, for example, bank<br>
applications. The user has a personal code called UPI (User Personal Identifier). When a<br>
base unit wishes to obtain a signature from the user of a mobile unit, it transmits thereto a<br>
request "authentication request" whose format is described in the standard cited above.<br>
On its part, said mobile unit receives the request "authentication request".<br>
It calculates a first authentication result RES 1 based on the UPI code entered by the user via<br>
the keypad of the unit. Then the mobile unit sends a reply "authentication reply" containing<br>
said first result to the base unit.<br>
The base unit then calculates a second authentication result XRES1 based<br>
on the UPI code assigned to said mobile unit, after which the base unit compares said first<br>
and second results RES1 and XRES1. The user is correctly authenticated when they are the<br>
same.<br>
The authentication results RES1 and XRES1 are calculated in accordance<br><br>
with Recommendation ETS 300175-7: The UPI code is combined with a key hidden to the<br>
user and stored in a memory before being applied, together with other data generated at<br>
random and transmitted to the other unit in the request or reply messages, to a calculating<br>
unit for calculating an authentication algorithm called DSAA (DECT Standard Authentication<br>
Algorithm).<br>
The invention notably has for its object to apply this procedure to the<br>
access restriction for mobile units to the telecommunications network.<br>
Therefore, a certain number of access criterions are defined and an access<br>
code is assigned to each of these criterions. The users which have rights of access in relation<br>
to said criterions are in possession of the corresponding access codes.<br>
The process according to the invention will now be described with<br>
reference to Fig. 3 for a first embodiment.<br>
In step 10, a user dials a telephone number NT on the keypad of his unit<br>
4. The unit 4 then starts the communication by emitting a message "call request" to the base<br>
unit 1.<br>
In step 11, the base unit receives this message. It then analyzes the called<br>
number contained in this message in step 12 to determine whether it is an emergency<br>
number. Indeed, in an advantageous embodiment of the invention, certain emergency<br>
numbers are defined for which the procedure of network access restriction and access control<br>
is not implemented. They are, for example, the telephone numbers of the fire brigade, the<br>
police .... Thus, if the number of the called unit is an emergency number, the base unit<br>
directly goes over to step 30 where the call is processed. In the opposite case, the process<br>
according to the invention continues with step 13.<br>
In step 13, the base unit runs through a list of defined criterions by<br>
verifying whether they can be applied. And for each criterion C that can be applied, it<br>
performs the operations corresponding to steps 113 to 120. When the list has been<br>
completed, this means that the access has been given for all the defined criterions, and the<br>
operation carries on with step 30.<br>
By way of example, verifying whether a criterion is applicable comprises:<br>
-	for a criterion relating to the destination of the call, verifying whether the formed number<br>
is likely to be forbidden (for example, if one seeks to check the international access code,<br>
one verifies whether the compound number starts with 19 and if this is not the case, the<br>
access is authorized and the operation carries on directly to box 30),<br>
-	for a criterion relating to the time of call, verifying the time given by the clock of the base<br><br>
unit (if one is in a time range during which the access is not checked, the operation directly<br>
proceeds to box 30).<br>
In step 113, the base unit sends an authentication request "authentication<br>
request" to the calling user. In another advantageous embodiment, an audio signal and/or an<br>
advice is sent to the base unit beforehand to warn the user and ask him to enter the access<br>
code that corresponds to said criterion. In practice, this audio signal and this advice are<br>
transmitted in messages CC-INFO whose INFORMATION ELEMENT field is equal to<br> &gt; for the audio signal and to  &gt; for the advice,<br>
respectively.<br>
In step 114, the mobile unit receives this request. In step 115, the user<br>
enters said access code CA and, in step 116, the mobile unit calculates a first authentication<br>
result RES1 by utilizing this code as a key instead of the identification code UPI. In step<br>
117, this result RES1 is sent to the base station in a message "authentication reply".<br>
This reply is received by the base unit in step 118. In step 119, it<br>
calculates a second authentication result XRES1 based on the access code that corresponds to<br>
the selected criterion. Then, in step 120, it compares the two authentication results RES1 and<br>
XRES1. If these results are the same, the access to the telecommunications network is<br>
authorized for the criterion C. The operation is thus resumed at step 13 to verify whether the<br>
access is also authorized as a function of other criterions. On the other hand, if the two<br>
results are different, the access is denied to the base unit and the communication is<br>
terminated in step 40.<br>
In this embodiment, the access code corresponding to a criterion is asked<br>
from the user for the start of the communication.<br>
In another embodiment, another type of criterion is defined for which the<br>
user is cyclically asked for the access code. Such a criterion notably permits of checking the<br>
duration of the communications. An elementary duration is defined beyond which the user is<br>
to enter the access code that corresponds to this criterion. If the code entered is correct, the<br>
communication is continued, the user thus being conscious of the elapsed time. On the other<br>
hand, if the code is not correct, this means that the user is not authorized to carry on with<br>
this communication beyond this elementary duration, and the communication is shut off.<br>
Although the invention has been described within the scope of the DECT<br>
standard, it is not restricted thereto. It may notably be used in any telecommunications<br>
system in which a user authentication procedure is provided.<br>
Furthermore, the invention is not restricted to the embodiments which<br><br>
have just been described by way of example. Variants may be provided notably by<br>
substituting equivalent technical means.<br><br>
