AS THE WIND TURBINE BLADES AND THE TOWER WITH A WORK PLATFORM AND<br>
WORK PLATFORM THEREFOR<br>
Background of the invention<br>
The invention relates to a method of approaching, for servicing the outer components of<br>
a wind turbine such as the wind turbine blades and the tower with a work platform and a<br>
work platform therefor.<br>
Description of the Related Art<br>
Normally, wind turbines are erected in places in which the wind conditions are<br>
advantageous e.g. in places with few obstacles blocking or altering the path of the wind.<br>
This means that the wind turbines often are positioned in more or less remote places<br>
with a poor infrastructure such as in terms of road quality.<br>
This creates some problems in relation to the necessary maintenance of the outer<br>
components of the wind turbines such as the wind turbine blades or the surface of the<br>
wind turbine tower. The magnitude of the problems has accumulated significantly in<br>
recent years with the increasing size of the wind turbines.<br>
Previously, freestanding cranes or lifts have been used in connection with maintenance<br>
or reparation of the outer components of the wind turbines. However, with the poor<br>
infrastructure, the transportation of the cranes or lifts to the erection places of the wind<br>
turbines is somewhat costly and time consuming.<br>
In order to overcome the problem of transporting large and heavy equipment to the<br>
erection places different solutions have been suggested.<br><br>
WO 2004/092577	PCT/DK2003/000257<br>
2<br>
One has been using persons lowering them selves down the side of the wind turbine<br>
tower or blades using ropes connected to the nacelle. However, the method naturally<br>
requires experts in climbing and is somewhat restricted in the work possibilities on<br>
the wind turbine and as such not a feasible solution to the problems of maintenance<br>
or reparation of the outer components of the wind turbines.<br>
Another has been the installation of a crane and a cable basket underneath the nacelle<br>
of the wind turbine allowing the basket to be lowered down the side of the wind<br>
turbine. However, the basket is difficult to position correctly and difficult to work<br>
from due to its unstable nature.<br>
One of the objects of the invention is to establish a method and system for wind<br>
turbines without the above-mentioned disadvantage.<br>
It is an object of the invention to create a method and system which allow one or<br>
more workers to be positioned at any adjacent position outside the wind turbine such<br>
as near one of the wind turbine blades without involving heavy equipment on the<br>
ground.<br>
Further, it is an object of the invention to create a method and system which allow<br>
safe and stable conditions for the workers.<br>
The invention<br>
The invention relates to a method of servicing the outer components of a wind<br>
turbine such as the wind turbine blades and the tower with a work platform, said<br>
method comprises the steps of:<br>
positioning the work platform at the wind turbine tower,<br><br>
WO 2004/092577	PCT/DK2003/000257<br><br>
3<br>
connecting the work platform to an upper part of the wind turbine with at least one<br>
cable,<br>
raising the work platform with the cable and cable winding means to a position of<br>
use, and<br>
holding the work platform to the side of the wind turbine tower with holding means.<br>
Hereby it is possible to establish a method that allows safe and stable conditions for<br>
one or more workers performing service on the outer components of a wind turbine<br>
such as the wind turbine blades and the tower.<br>
In an aspect of the invention, said holding is established with at least two sets of<br>
suction or vacuum cups, allowing an easily controllable but still firm hold on the<br>
wind turbine tower.<br>
In a further aspect of the invention, said holding is enhanced by positioning said<br>
suction or vacuum cups on the ends of holding arms, said arms gripping around the<br>
exterior of the wind turbine tower. Hereby it is possible to establish a grip around the<br>
wind turbine tower, the grip being advantageous in absorbing and withstanding any<br>
twists in the work platform.<br>
In an even further aspect of the invention, said method further comprises the step of<br>
moving the work platform horizontally by extracting or retracting horizontal forcing<br>
means of the work platform. Hereby it is possible to position the work platform at<br>
any adjacent position outside the wind turbine such as near one of the wind turbine<br>
blades.<br>
In another aspect of the invention, the extracting or retracting is established<br>
telescopically by a number of arm sections in said horizontal forcing means. Hereby<br><br>
WO 2004/092577	PCT/DK2003/000257<br><br>
4<br>
a preferred embodiment of the invention is achieved that is simple to construct and<br>
control during use.<br>
In a further aspect of the invention, cable guiding means angles the cable outwards in<br>
relation to the wind turbine tower from the starting point of the cable. Hereby an<br>
advantageous embodiment of the invention is achieved.<br>
In an even further aspect of the invention, said work platform is moved up or down<br>
by following and rolling with steering wheels of the platform on the surface of the<br>
wind turbine tower. Hereby a further advantageous embodiment of the invention is<br>
achieved.<br>
The invention also relates to a work platform, said platform further comprises<br>
gripping means for holding the work platform to the tower. Hereby it is possible to<br>
establish an apparatus that allows safe and stable conditions for one or more workers<br>
performing service on the outer components of a wind turbine such as the wind<br>
turbine blades and the tower.<br>
In an aspect of the invention, said at least one cable comprises a number of outer<br>
cables, said set including a main cable and one or more additional cables.<br>
In a further aspect of the invention, said at least one cable further comprises an inner<br>
cable or cables.<br>
The more than one cable may enhance the safety level of the work platform.<br>
In an aspect of the invention, said inner and outer cables are fixed to the underside of<br>
the wind turbine nacelle at an inner and outer anchorage point in direction from the<br>
tower or to anchorage points inside the nacelle.<br><br>
WO 2004/092577	PCT/DK2003/000257<br>
5<br>
In an aspect of the invention, said gripping means comprises at least two sets of<br>
suction or vacuum cups. With two or more sets of suction or vacuum cups it is<br>
possible to engage the wind turbine tower from more than one side e.g. from<br>
opposite sides ensuring a more firm grip. However it shall be emphasized that the<br>
gripping means may be established with just one set of suction or vacuum cups<br>
engaging the tower in one position. The position is preferably in front of the work<br>
platform ensuring a balance for the platform around the position.<br>
The suction or vacuum cups may be used in connection with any type of wind<br>
turbine tower such as towers made in metal or concrete.<br>
In another aspect of the invention, said gripping means comprises at least two sets of<br>
electromagnetic means. The electromagnetic means may be one or more<br>
electromagnets in which the electric power supply for the magnets is controlled in<br>
order to hold on to/let go of the metal surface of the tower.<br>
In a further aspect of the invention, said gripping means comprises retaining means<br>
surrounding the wind turbine tower such as at least one retaining belt or band. The<br>
retaining means surround the tower totally or partly and are connected to the gripping<br>
means in which the gripping means may tighten or release the retaining means in<br>
order to hold the work platform at the position or to allow movement of the platform,<br>
respectively. The belt or band is preferably made in iron or an iron alloy. Further, the<br>
belt or band may be made in other materials such as a reinforced composite or woven<br>
material.<br>
In another aspect of the invention, each of said at least two sets of suction or vacuum<br>
cups or electromagnetic means are flexibly mounted to the end of a holding arm.<br>
With the flexible mounting of the cups or electromagnetic means an advantageous<br>
possibility of adapting the holding arms to the more or less uneven surface of the<br>
wind turbine tower is achieved. Further, with the flexible mounting the inclination of<br>
the tower does not affect the functionality of the cups or electromagnetic means.<br><br>
WO 2004/092577	PCT/DK2003/000257<br>
6<br>
In a further aspect of the invention, said holding arm includes a base arm section,<br>
inner arm section and outer arm section. By the sectioning of the arms, an ability of<br>
angling the arms individually is achieved in order to grip different sized wind turbine<br>
towers.<br>
In an even further aspect of the invention, said inner arm section and outer arm<br>
section are pivotally connected and controlled by arm actuating means in at least one<br>
direction. Hereby it is possible to adapt the arm sections to the inclination of the<br>
tower in question regardless of the (small) size of the inclination.<br>
In another aspect of the invention, said gripping means comprises one or more<br>
steering wheels. With the steering wheels it is easy to vertically move and roll the<br>
work platform to a given position of use. Further the steering wheels help controlling<br>
the path that the work platform follows when it is moved up or down the surface of<br>
the wind turbine tower.<br>
In an aspect of the invention, guard rails and a foundation define a work area of said<br>
platform. As modern wind turbines comprises a nacelle height of more than 50<br>
meters the workers need protection from falling of the platform e.g. as a result of an<br>
unexpected wind gust or the like.<br>
In an aspect of the invention, said gripping means and the foundation are connected<br>
through horizontal forcing means. With the ability of forcing or moving the work<br>
platform horizontally, it is possible to work with different outer components of the<br>
wind turbine regardless of their position in relation to the wind turbine tower.<br>
Especially with modern wind turbines, in which the distance between the tower and<br>
the wind turbine blades may be between 5 and 10 meters, the ability of moving the<br>
work platform horizontally is advantageous.<br><br>
WO 2004/092577	PCT/DK2003/000257<br>
7<br>
In an aspect of the invention, said horizontal forcing means includes a number of<br>
horizontal forcing arms. With a number of arms, instead of one long arm, the forcing<br>
means may be constructed with a smaller length.<br>
In an aspect of the invention, said horizontal forcing arms are integrated into each<br>
other as part of telescopic forcing means. With the telescopic adaptation the<br>
necessary length may be obtained with a more compact construction of the forcing<br>
means. Further, the telescopic forcing means ensures that the horizontal forcing of<br>
the work platform is achieved with a linear approach of the forcing means.<br>
In an aspect of the invention, the side or sides of said platform includes one or more<br>
indentations for receiving and docking one or more wind turbine blades. The<br>
receiving and docking of the blade in an indentation is especially important as the<br>
indentation defines an area that at least partly surrounds the blade. The surrounding<br>
ensures that the blade may be retained from different positions e.g. retraining the<br>
leading or trailing edge together with both sides of the blade. Further, the workers<br>
may approach and get close to both sides of the blade without dangerously leaning<br>
out over the guide rails.<br>
In a special embodiment the blade may enter the indentation and subsequently be<br>
surrounded by the work platform, wherein the surrounding is achieved by closing a<br>
pivotally connected section of the platform behind the blade. The section preferably<br>
comprises the necessary guide rails allowing the workers to walk around the blade in<br>
its full circumference.<br>
It shall be emphasised that the blade may be docked at any position along the sides of<br>
the work platform. The indentations are merely adapted for a safer docking by<br>
allowing a better retaining of the blade.<br>
In an aspect of the invention, said platform includes retaining means for retaining the<br>
wind turbine blade in one of said indentations. The retaining means are important as<br><br>
WO 2004/092577	PCT/DK2003/000257<br>
4'<br>
8<br>
they ensure that any movements in the blade is retained e.g. at a wind gust and thus<br>
protect the workers from potential injuries during the work on the blade. As the blade<br>
is positioned in an indentation the retaining means may attack from opposite side<br>
against the surface of the blade ensuring a solid and continuing hold on the blade.<br>
In an aspect of the invention, said retaining means includes one or more suction or<br>
vacuum cups positioned on one or more rods as base part for the retaining means.<br>
The hold by suction or vacuum cups ensures both the solid and continuing hold of<br>
the blade and at the same time a gentle hold without any pressure marks on the blade.<br>
In an aspect of the invention, said cable is controlled by cable guiding means e.g. by<br>
one or more cable guidance wheels in said means. The abrasion of the cable may be<br>
avoided and thus ensuring the security of the worker on the platform.<br>
In an aspect of the invention, said cable guiding means controls the angling of the<br>
cable. By controlling the angling of the cable, it is possible to achieve different<br>
advantageous characteristics such as forcing the work platform against the tower. By<br>
forcing the platform against the tower the necessary strength of the gripping means<br>
may be reduced.<br>
In an aspect of the invention, control means at least controls said arm actuating<br>
means, horizontal forcing means, said one or more suction or vacuum pumps and/or<br>
said cable winding means.<br>
In another aspect of the invention, said control means is connected wired or<br>
wirelessly to and controlled by at least one remote control. Equipped with a remote<br>
control the worker may move more freely on the platform and control the<br>
components of the platform more precisely and thus is both the flexibility and the<br>
security of the platform enhanced.<br><br>
WO 2004/092577	PCT/DK2003/000257<br>
9<br>
In a further aspect of the invention, said control means and auxiliary devices are<br>
controlled with more than one remote control, said controls working in a master and<br>
slave configuration. Hereby it is possible to control components of the work platform or<br>
with the auxiliary devices components of the wind turbine, such as the turning of the<br>
rotor, from different positions e.g. the work platform and the ground or the nacelle.<br>

Detailed description<br>
Fig. 1 illustrates a modern wind turbine 1 with a tower 2 and a wind turbine nacelle 3<br>
positioned on top of the tower. The wind turbine rotor 5, comprising three wind<br>
turbine blades, is connected to the nacelle through the low speed shaft which extends<br>
out of the nacelle front.<br><br>
WO 2004/092577	PCT/DK2003/000257<br>
11<br>
As illustrated in the figure, wind beyond a certain level will activate the rotor due to<br>
the lift induced on the blades and allow it to rotate in a perpendicular direction to the<br>
wind. The rotation movement is converted to electric power, which is usually<br>
supplied to the transmission grid as known by skilled persons within the area.<br>
Fig. 2a illustrates a work platform 6 according to the invention moving upwards on<br>
the side of a wind turbine tower in connection with a maintenance or reparation job<br>
on the wind turbine 1.<br>
Further, it is illustrated that the wind turbine blades are pitched out of the wind<br>
(parallel with the wind) and not moving as the wind turbine is stopped during the job.<br>
The figure also illustrates that a worker is positioned inside the work platform.<br>
i<br>
The work platform is connected to the wind turbine nacelle 3 with at least one cable<br>
7 in which the cables arrive at the nacelle from a position underneath the nacelle. The<br>
work platform also comprises gripping means 8 that substantially horizontal reaches<br>
out against the side of the wind turbine tower 2.<br>
The cables 7 may be an integrated part of the wind turbine located inside the nacelle<br>
and lowered to the ground through openings in the bottom of the nacelle. Further, the<br>
cable may arrive together with the work platform 6 and be transported to the nacelle<br>
e.g. by a worker carrying the cable to the nacelle using the stairs inside the wind<br>
turbine, securely fastening one end of the cable to the nacelle and lowering the other<br>
end down to the ground.<br>
Another way would be to carry a thin rope to the nacelle and lower it down to the<br>
ground, tie it to a cable end and drag the cable up to the nacelle on the outside of the<br>
wind turbine tower e.g. with the aid of a lifter in the nacelle before securely fastening<br>
the cable to the nacelle.<br><br>
WO 2004/092577	PCT/DK2003/000257<br>
12<br>
After the cable has reached the ground or the nacelle, it is fastened to cable winding<br>
means of the work platform allowing the work platform to be raised from the ground<br>
by winding the cable on the work platform.<br>
However, in a further embodiment the cable winding means may be positioned in the<br>
nacelle and the cable thus only firmly secured to the work platform.<br>
The accumulators may, in another embodiment of the work platform, be replaced or<br>
supplemented with a diesel generator positioned on the work platform.<br>
Finally, the figure illustrates that the work platform was transported to the place of<br>
the wind turbine on a trailer connected to a truck 9 e.g. the normal service truck of<br>
the company servicing wind turbines. The truck may include different tools or<br>
machinery needed in connection with the maintenance and reparation job. Further,<br>
the truck may be used in supplying power to the necessary electric accumulators or<br>
air containers of the work platform e.g. during transportation by charging the<br>
accumulators from the generator of the truck, or the containers from a compressor.<br>
Fig. 2b illustrates the work platform in a use situation at the tip of a wind turbine<br>
blade 5 in which the blade is ready for servicing by the worker on the platform.<br>
In order to arrive at the position of fig. 2b from the position of fig. 2 a the work<br>
platform is lifted with the cable winding means while steering wheels of the gripping<br>
means 8 are forced against the wind turbine tower allowing the work platform to roll<br>
over the surface of the tower during the displacement.<br>
After arrival at the position of use the work platform is still connected to the nacelle<br>
through the cables 7 but is also connected to the tower through the gripping means 8<br>
which grippes the wind turbine tower 2 at least two positions (as will be explained in<br>
further details below).<br><br>
WO 2004/092577	PCT/DK2003/000257<br>
13<br>
The wind turbine blade is twisted to a position in which the worker has access to the<br>
surface of the blade (the blade being in a position substantially perpendicular to the<br>
wind at the figure). The wind turbine blade is also secured to the work platform in<br>
order to avoid any unintended movement of the blade during the work process.<br>
When the work is done at the position the gripping means 8 are released from the<br>
tower and the cable winding means lifts (and rolls) the work platform to a new<br>
position in which the gripping means 8 are once again secured to the tower. This may<br>
be repeated until the blade in its full length has been serviced.<br>
Hereafter the other wind turbine blades may undergo the same procedure. The blade<br>
to undergo the procedure is rotated to meet the side of the work platform in which<br>
the movement may be achieved by turning the high speed shaft linking the generator<br>
and the gear in the nacelle e.g. by an auxiliary device comprising an electric motor.<br>
Further, the movement may be achieved by using the generator as an electric motor<br>
taking electric energy from the public electric grid. Even further, a movement may be<br>
achieved by slightly and briefly pitching one or more blades into the wind.<br>
Fig. 3 illustrates a preferred embodiment of the work platform 6 according to the<br>
invention positioned on (and partly concealed by) the wind turbine tower 2.<br>
The work platform is constructed with a foundation 18 surrounded by guard rails 13<br>
in which the foundation and the guide rails defining a work area for the worker or<br>
workers.<br>
The work platform further comprises cable guiding means 12 guiding two cables 7a,<br>
7b to cable winding means 43. The cable winding means 43 comprises motor and<br>
gearing means in which the gearing means has a high gearing ratio e.g. 1500 motor<br>
shaft rotations for each cable winding.<br><br>
WO 2004/092577	PCT/DK2003/000257<br>
14<br>
The work platform further comprises a box 10 at the side wherein different hydraulic<br>
and/or pneumatic components may be positioned (as will be explained in connection<br>
with figs. 10a and 10b).<br>
In a first embodiment the cable winding means 43 are positioned at the foot of the<br>
cable guiding means 12 in which the winded cables 7 continue freely down under the<br>
platform or even stay on the floor of the platform, hi another embodiment of the<br>
invention the cables may be accumulated in a cable drum positioned inside the box<br>
10 or another suitable place at the work platform.<br>
The cable guiding means 12 comprises a number of guidance wheels that direct the<br>
cables 7a, 7b to the cable winding means 43 and protect the cable from abrasion. The<br>
cable guiding means is preferably positioned centrally on the platform or the outer<br>
section of the platform in relation to the tower.<br>
In a situation in which the horizontal forcing means is fully retracted, the cables are<br>
vertical or preferably slightly angled to meet the cable guiding means. The angling of<br>
the cable is outwardly in relation to the wind turbine tower from its anchorage point<br>
of the wind turbine ensuring that the work platform, regardless of the degree of<br>
extraction of the horizontal forcing means, is forced against the tower. The angling is<br>
established with the positioning of the cable guiding means on the work platform and<br>
the anchorage point.<br>
In order to freely adapt the work platform to different anchorage points the point of<br>
attack of the cable guiding means may be moved horizontally. As the point of attack<br>
may be seen as the cable guidance wheels of the cable guiding means the movement<br>
of the attack point may be achieved by moving the wheels. The moving may be<br>
established by having sets of openings for holding the shafts of the cable guidance<br>
wheels in which the sets are spaced apart.<br><br>

The work platform also comprises different docking areas lla, lib for a wind<br>
turbine blade. The first docking areas lla are indentations on the opposite side of the<br>
work platform in which the blade is allowed to enter one of the indentations with the<br>
front or trailing edge facing the work platform. When the blade is positioned in the<br>
indentation, retaining means from the work platform is forced against the sides of the<br>
blade keeping the blade fixed in relation to the work platform.<br>
With indentations on opposite side of the work platform it is possible to service wind<br>
turbine blades from both sides of the platform but the work platform may also work<br>
with just one first docking area lla. The first docking areas and further docking areas<br>
are described in relation to fig. 4.<br>
The figure further illustrates the one (non-concealed) half of the gripping means 8 of<br>
the work platform. The gripping means includes an arm stretching out along the side<br>
of the wind turbine tower. The arm fairly follows the surface of the wind turbine<br>
tower by comprising a number of arm sections pivotally connected to each other. The<br>
gripping means 8 comprises a steering wheel 14 approximately at half-length of the<br>
arm, the wheel being forced against the surface of the tower 2. Further, at the end of<br>
the gripping means 8, holding means 15 is positioned for holding onto the wind<br>
turbine tower 2.<br>
Fig. 4 illustrates the positioning of a wind turbine blade in relation to the work<br>
platform, the platform seen from below.<br>
The figure illustrates blades positioned in docking areas; on one side of the work<br>
platform (solid line in the presentation a cross section of the blade) and on the<br>
opposite side (dotted line). The blades are both docked with the leading or trailing<br>
edge facing the side of the work platform and the diametrical line of the blades being<br>
perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the platform. The figure also illustrates<br>
a situation in which the blade is docked parallel with the longitudinal direction of the<br>
platform in a further indentation 1 lb (dotted line). The blade may be retained in the<br><br>
WO 2004/092577	PCT/DK2003/000257<br>
16<br>
further indentation by securing a strap around the blade and fixing the strap ends to<br>
the guide rail.<br>
The figure further illustrates the retaining means being forced against the sides of the<br>
wind turbine blade. Each of the retaining means comprises a head and a base 16a,<br>
17a; 16b, 17b, respectively. The retaining means may simply be rubber heads or<br>
similar flexible members on rods forced against the sides and fastened to the work<br>
platform ensuring that the blade is retained. However, the retaining heads may also<br>
be suction or vacuum cups e.g. with connection to a vacuum pump.<br>
Fig. 5 illustrates the preferred embodiment of the work platform in its entirety and in<br>
perspective.<br>
Especially the figure illustrates the gripping means 8 in its entirety with both holding<br>
arms stretching out to grip the wind turbine tower at two positions with the holding<br>
means 15a, 15b or to roll on the surface of the tower with the two steering wheels<br>
14a, 14b.<br>
As it is also seen on the figure each arm of the gripping means 8 comprises a base<br>
arm section 21a, 21b connected to an inner arm section 20a, 20b, said inner arm is<br>
connected to an outer arm section 19a, 19b. The base arm sections are further<br>
connected to each other and the work platform through a base part comprising<br>
horizontal forcing means 23.<br>
The connection between the base and the inner arm sections is made rigid by a<br>
sidepiece. The connection between the inner and the outer arm sections 19a, 20a;<br>
19b, 20b is made variable by using a pivotal connection and arm actuating means<br>
22a, 22b, such as linear electric, hydraulic or pneumatic actuators, allowing the outer<br>
arm sections and especially the holding means 15a, 15b to be moved closer to or<br>
further away from each other.<br><br>
WO 2004/092577	PCT/DK2003/000257<br>
17<br>
Further, the figure illustrates another cable 7c extending toward the work platform<br>
and entering at cable guidance means on the platform. The cable guidance means<br>
directs the cable 7c to the cable winding mechanism 44 at the centre of the gripping<br>
means 8.<br>
Finally, the figure illustrates one of the retaining means 16b, 17b for retaining a wind<br>
turbine blade in greater details.<br>
The work platform, and especially the essential parts, such as the foundation of the<br>
work platform 18, the horizontal forcing means 23 and/or the gripping means 8, are<br>
preferably made in steel or steel alloys.<br>
However, other metals may be used in the construction of the work platform such as<br>
aluminium or aluminium alloys. Further different composite materials may be used<br>
such as glass, aramid or carbon fibre materials.<br>
The cables connecting the work platform with the upper part of the wind turbine are<br>
preferably steel wires. Ropes such as a nylon rope may also be used if the strength of<br>
the ropes is significant enough to hold the platform including the workers.<br>
Fig. 6 illustrates the connection between the wind turbine and the work platform. The<br>
connection comprises several cables 7 that extend from the nacelle 3 to different<br>
positions on the work platform 6. The cables are divided in inner or outer cables in<br>
which the terms "inner" and "outer" are to be understood as their position in relation<br>
to the surface of the wind turbine tower.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the inner and outer cables are connected to different<br>
anchorage points on the underside of the nacelle. The points are positioned<br>
somewhere between the wind turbine tower 3 and the wind turbine rotor 5 with the<br>
inner point closer to the tower than the outer point e.g. 0.2 and 1.2 meter from the<br>
tower, respectively.<br><br>
WO 2004/092577	PCT/DK2003/000257<br>

The inner and outer cables extend to an inner and an outer position at the work<br>
platform in which they are connected to separate cable winding mechanisms 43, 44,<br>
as explained in relation to figs. 3 and 4.<br>
The enlarged section view further illustrates a preferred embodiment of the invention<br>
and especially the extension of the inner 7c and outer cables 7a, 7b from the<br>
underside of the nacelle.<br>
The inner cable is illustrated as one cable 7c that extend from an inner anchorage<br>
point to the inner position at the work platform with the inner cable winding<br>
mechanism 44. The inner cable forms an angle a with the underside of the nacelle.<br>
The angle is preferably 90 degrees, the cable extends vertically, or less than 90<br>
degrees, the cable extends outwardly in relation to the tower from the anchorage<br>
point.<br>
The outer cables are illustrated as two cables 7a, 7b that extends from an outer<br>
anchorage point 45 to the outer position at the work platform. As explained above,<br>
the cable guiding means 12 is the outer position at the work platform that guides the<br>
cables to the outer cable winding mechanism 43. The outer cables form an angle P<br>
with the underside of the nacelle. The angle is preferably 90 degrees, the cables<br>
extend vertically, or less than 90 degrees, the cables extend outwardly in relation to<br>
the tower from the anchorage point.<br>
The anchorage points may be eyelets or similar preinstalled connection points on the<br>
underside of the nacelle. In order to get to the anchorage points, the nacelle may<br>
comprise one or more small openings in the floor of the nacelle allowing a worker to<br>
position the cable at the anchorage point. Alternatively, the cables may enter the<br>
nacelle through openings and be fixed to anchorage points inside the nacelle.<br><br>
WO 2004/092577	PCT/DK2003/000257<br>
19<br>
The function of the cables 7a, 7b, 7c is the moving of the work platform, i.e. lifting<br>
or lowering the work platform. The inner cable ensures that the inner section of the<br>
work platform, including the gripping means 8, is correctly moved regardless of the<br>
conditions of the surface that the steering wheels 14 meet on the wind turbine tower.<br>
The outer cables ensure that the work platform as such is moved and especially that<br>
the outer section of the work platform is moved. The outer cables are divided into a<br>
main cable and one or more additional cables for security reasons. The main cable<br>
may single-handed carry the weight of the work platform but in case of a cable break<br>
the additional cables will maintain the work platform at the position. Further, the<br>
winding speed of the cables are monitored by safety means ensuring that the winding<br>
speed does not exceed an upper limit such as 4 meters per minute. The safety limit<br>
ensures that the work platform is not handled at dangerously high speeds, e.g. by the<br>
worker, under normal conditions or at failure situations such as a breakdown in a<br>
cable winding mechanism. The overspeed safety means is preferably<br>
electro/mechanical devices of a centrifugal or a magnetic motion type that slows<br>
down or temporarily stops the work platform. The safety means may also stop the<br>
work platform in a situation of cable overwind or weight overload.<br>
In order to keep the work platform horizontal or at least relatively horizontal, the<br>
platform comprises level indication means. The level indication means may be a part<br>
of the control system, described in relation with fig. 12, and as such be part of the<br>
system generating control signals for the cable winding mechanisms ensuring the<br>
horizontal position of the work platform. The level indication means may be<br>
combined with tension means monitoring the tension on each of the different cables.<br>
Both at vertical and horizontal movement of the work platform it is important to<br>
monitor and ensure the horizontal position of the work platform, and it may be<br>
achieved by controlling the cable winding mechanisms individually e.g. in order to<br>
achieve the horizontal position and level the strain on the cables.<br><br>
WO 2004/092577	PCT/DK2003/000257<br>
20<br>
In a basic embodiment of the invention the number of cables is set to just one cable<br>
wherein the cable is extended to an outer position of the work platform such as the<br>
cable guiding means 12.<br>
Further, the cables may be fixed to the work platform and connected with cable<br>
winding mechanisms in the nacelle.<br>
Figs. 7a and 7b illustrate the work platform and especially the horizontal forcing<br>
means 23 in two different positions.<br>
Fig. 7a illustrates the first position in which the horizontal forcing means 23 is folly<br>
retracted. The retraction of the horizontal forcing means 23 will position the work<br>
platform close to the wind turbine tower, e.g. allowing inspection and repair of the<br>
surface of the tower. Further, the position will be the normal position during truck<br>
transportation of the work platform as well as the normal position during the initial<br>
lifting of the work platform along the wind turbine tower.<br>
Fig. 7b illustrates a second position in which the horizontal forcing means 23 is<br>
partly extracted.<br>
As seen on the figure, the horizontal forcing means 23 includes a number of<br>
horizontal forcing arms. The arms may preferably be four-sided tubes in which the<br>
tubes are telescopically integrated into each other. The tubes may be extracted or<br>
retracted successively or individually by means of electric, hydraulic or pneumatic<br>
means.<br>
The electric means may include one or more electric motors driving one or more<br>
spindles. The hydraulic or pneumatic means may include a piston driven by the<br>
hydraulic or pneumatic forces.<br><br>
WO 2004/092577	PCT/DK2003/000257<br>
21<br>
The extraction of the horizontal forcing means 23 will position the work platform<br>
away from the wind turbine tower, e.g. allowing service of the surface of the wind<br>
turbine blades.<br>
As the distance between the wind turbine tower and the blades are quite significant at<br>
modern wind turbines, the horizontal forcing means 23 should at full extraction be of<br>
a certain length such as between 5 and 10 meters in order to be able to service any<br>
type of modern wind turbine.<br>
It should be understood that the term "horizontal forcing means" means that the<br>
forcing means preferably acts in a substantially horizontal direction against the wind<br>
turbine tower. However, the forcing means may in other embodiments be sloped to<br>
an angle significantly above or below the horizontal direction.<br>
Figs. 8a to 8c illustrate the structure of a preferred embodiment of the horizontal<br>
forcing means 23.<br>
The forcing means comprises a fixed part 25 holding the extractable and retractable<br>
horizontal forcing arms 23a, 23b. The fixed part is normally mounted underneath the<br>
foundation 18 of the work platform in its full length.<br>
The dotted lines may be seen as the surface of the wind turbine tower or the holding<br>
means 15 which the rest of the work platform is moved away from with the<br>
extraction of the forcing means.<br>
Fig. 8 a illustrates the structure in a retracted position for the horizontal forcing means<br>
23.<br>

horizontal forcing arm 23 a, 23b of the horizontal forcing means 23. The figure<br>
illustrates the horizontal forcing means 23 with both arms in fully extracted<br>
positions. However, in further embodiments the number of arms may be more than<br>
two arms e.g. the use of three or four arms of a shorter length than the present two<br>
Figs. 9a and 9b illustrate a preferred embodiment of the holding means 15 for the<br>
wind turbine tower.<br>
The holding means are preferably flexible mounted onto the ends of the outer arm<br>
sections 19a, 19b of the gripping means 8. The flexibility may be used in order to<br>
adapt the holding means to the slightly sloping surface of the wind turbine tower 2.<br>
Further, the holding means comprises two substantially oval holding devices (and<br>
rather long in an up-down direction) positioned next to each other. However, the<br>
number of holding devices and their shapes may be altered in order to meet different<br>
situations in which the present shape is preferred in order to advantageously absorb<br>
vertical forces.<br>
Fig. 9a illustrates the holding means 15 seen perceptively from the front. The holding<br>
means comprises an oval first and second suction or vacuum cup 27a, 27b.<br>
The second cup 27b includes a suction opening 28 in one end of the cup in which the<br>
opening is connected to a suction pump with tube means. Further, the second cup<br>
27b includes a connection opening 29b in the other end of the cup. The opening is<br>
connected with a connection tube 30 to a connection opening 29a in the first suction<br>
or vacuum cup 27a. The connection between the two suction or vacuum cups ensures<br>
that a common pressure condition is established in the cups.<br>
The suction or vacuum cups may include rubber rims or lips 32 in order to retain the<br>
pressure condition inside the cups.<br><br>
WO 2004/092577	PCT/DK2003/000257<br>
23<br>
The two suction or vacuum cups are rigidly fastened to a connecting rod 31. The<br>
connecting rod 31 may on the other hand be flexibly fastened to the gripping means<br>
as mentioned above e.g. with some sort of a tip-up hinge.<br>
Fig. 9b illustrates the holding means 15 seen perceptively from the opposite side<br>
after being rotated half a turn.<br>
The figure especially illustrates the outlet of the suction opening 28 in which a tube,<br>
with connection to a suction pump, is to be mounted.<br>
The two suction or vacuum cups on each side of the gripping means may be used in<br>
order to firmly engage the work platform to the wind turbine tower by applying a<br>
very low suction pressure or even vacuum inside the cups facing the tower surface.<br>
Together with the cable and the cable winding means the work platform may be held<br>
in place by the gripping means.<br>
Figs. 10a and 10b illustrates the hydraulic and/or pneumatic means positioned in a<br>
box 34 at one side of the work platform.<br>
Fig. 10a illustrates the box 34 with ventilation opening 33 in a first and second box<br>
door 35a, 35b. The doors allow full access to the hydraulic and/or pneumatic means<br>
inside the box.<br>
Fig. 10b illustrates some of the content in the box including needle valves 36<br>
controlling the hydraulic pump and tank 39 with the,motor 38. The magnetic<br>
controlled needle valves 36 thus control the hydraulic fluid pumped to the horizontal<br>
forcing means and other hydraulic actuated means of the work platform. The box<br>
further comprises a vacuum pump 39 that supplies the different suction or vacuum<br>
cups. The box may further comprise such means as electric accumulators and/or a<br><br>
WO 2004/092577	PCT/DK2003/000257<br>
24<br>
diesel generator, a cable drum 37 in which the cables 7, 7a, 7b, 7c are accumulated<br>
and one or more containers comprising compressed air.<br>
The air containers may be used as an energy source supplying some or all the energy<br>
consuming components of the work platform wherein the pressure of the containers<br>
preferably are quite high such as up to 40 bar.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, compressed air is used instead of hydraulic<br>
pressure in retracting/extracting the horizontal forcing means. Further, the<br>
compressed air is used to drive the motors of the cable winding means in which the<br>
normally used electric motors are replaced with pneumatic motors. Even further, the<br>
compressed air is used to establish the necessary vacuum pressure for the suction or<br>
vacuum cups. The containers may be reloaded with compressed air from a<br>
compressor installed in the truck (as mentioned above) e.g. during the transportation<br>
from one site of wind turbines to another. The remaining components such as the<br>
control means may be supplied with electric power from one or more electric<br>
accumulators.<br>
The necessary energy may in another embodiment be supplied partly or totally from<br>
the hydraulic system in which the hydraulic oil is pressurized with nitrogen supplied<br>
from nitrogen containers.<br>
Even further, in an embodiment the different components may be supplied with<br>
electric power e.g. in order to drive the hydraulic and vacuum pumps in which the<br>
electric power is supplied from the utility grid. An electric cable may connect the<br>
work platform with a power outlet inside the wind turbine e.g. a 400 or 24 V AC<br>
outlet. In another embodiment the cable connects the work platform with the<br>
generator of the truck wherein the truck is kept running in order to supply the<br>
necessary electric power without emptying the truck accumulators. The electric cable<br>
may hang freely or be winded with a cable retraction mechanism.<br><br>

25<br>
From the box the necessary air and/or hydraulic tubes extend, to the different<br>
components that are supplied with suction or vacuum, pressurized air or hydraulic<br>
oil. Further, electric power cables may transfer energy from electric accumulators, a<br>
diesel generator or the utility grid to any electric actuated, activated or controlled<br>
components.<br>

Fig. 12 illustrates an embodiment of a control system 40 in connection with a work<br>
platform according to the invention<br>
In order to control and monitor the functionalities of the work platform, it is<br>
necessary with a control system positioned on the work platform e.g. inside the box<br>
containing cable winding m0eans. The control system is preferably a microprocessor-<br><br>
WO 2004/092577	PCT/DK2003/000257<br>
29<br>
based system capable of receiving, transmitting, processing and storing signals. The<br>
control system comprises connections to the different means of the work platform<br>
that needs controlling or monitoring.<br>
The connections of the work platform may be divided into different groups such as<br>
control cables 4la-41f ensuring that control signals are transferred to control valves,<br>
switches and relays and sensor cables returning monitor signal to the control system,<br>
said signals concerning the functionality of the different components.<br>
The control cables may be cables 41a controlling the functionality of the suction or<br>
vacuum cups 16a, 16b of the retaining means for a wind turbine blade. Further cables<br>
41f may control the functionality of the suction or vacuum cups 15a, 15b of the<br>
gripping means.<br>
Other control cables 41b, 41 d may control the functionality of the cable winding<br>
mechanisms 43,44 for the inner and outer cables, respectively.<br>
Even further, control cables 41c may control the functionality of the hydraulic and/or<br>
pneumatic components of the box 10. More control cables (not illustrated on the<br>
figure) may control the status of the electric accumulators, the air containers, the<br>
diesel generator or further components of the work platform.<br>
The electric power cables may supply energy directly to mechanical means such as<br>
electric actuators converting the electricity to a physical change in position of the<br>
actuator rod e.g. the arm actuating means in the case they are electric driven. Further,<br>
the electricity may be supplied to pneumatic or hydraulic pumping means in which<br>
the pumping means supply pneumatic or hydraulic power to different actuating<br>
means such as the forcing means in the case they are pneumatic or hydraulic<br>
actuated. Even further, the suction or vacuum cups may be pneumatic supplied from<br>
one or more vacuum pumps, said pumps preferably being electrically driven.<br><br>
WO 2004/092577	PCT/DK2003/000257<br>
30<br>
The control cables connect the control systems with control switches and relays e.g.<br>
electric switches switching the electric power cables or hydraulic, pneumatic and<br>
vacuum pressure switches controlling the air or oil flow through the connection<br>
tubes.<br>
The monitoring cables may direct different status signals of the work platform to the<br>
control system such as the energy level of the accumulators, the pressure levels etc..<br>
If status signals indicate that the normal functionality of the work platform is not<br>
possible, e.g. due to low energy level of electric accumulators, the worker may<br>
choose to lower the work platform with the aid of a manually operated handle<br>
releasing the break of the cable winding means. The break release is preferably only<br>
partly ensuring that the lowering speed of the work platform is below the<br>
abovementioned speed limit. However, if the speed increases beyond the limit, the<br>
over speed break will take effect and slow down or even stop the work platform.<br>
If it is possible the manual operation may be supplemented by the remaining electric<br>
energy of the accumulators e.g. allowing the electric control of some necessary<br>
components of the work platform such as the gripping means. Further, the control<br>
system may define a lower limit for the accumulators wherein any normal<br>
functionality of the work platform is stopped if the limit is exceeded. After the limit<br>
has been exceeded, the work platform may preferably only be lowered.<br>
The control system 40 may be wired or wirelessly connected to a remote control 42.<br>
The wireless connection is established by using electromagnetic airwaves such as<br>
radio or infrared waves.<br>
The remote control allows a worker to control the different components of the work<br>
platform e.g. movement of the horizontal forcing means, the activation of the suction<br>
or vacuum cups or the raising/lowering of the platform. Further, the remote control<br>
may comprise display means for monitoring the above-mentioned status signals of<br><br>
WO 2004/092577	PCT/DK2003/000257<br>
31<br>
the different components or other signals such as the position of the horizontal<br>
forcing means. Even further, the control means or the remote control may comprise<br>
sound generating means in order to inform the workers of the status of the work<br>
platform or one or more of the components of the platform.<br>
The remote control may be held by one of the workers positioned on the work<br>
platform, on the ground or even in the nacelle.<br>
The remote control that controls the control system may also control different<br>
components of the wind turbine. In an embodiment the remote control controls the<br>
means that turns the rotor in connection with the change of wind turbine blades at the<br>
work platform, e.g. the above-mentioned auxiliary device comprising an electric<br>
motor. Further, the remote control can control any winding mechanism in the nacelle.<br>
Even further, the remote controlling of the work platform may be divided between<br>
several remote controls e.g. held by a worker on the work platform and a worker on<br>
the ground or in the nacelle. The worker on the ground or in the nacelle may<br>
remotely activate different components of the wind turbine while the worker on the<br>
platform controls the platform components with his remote control. Preferably, the<br>
remote control held by the worker on the platform overrules any other remote control<br>
e.g. in a master/slave remote control configuration.<br>
The invention has been exemplified above with reference to specific examples.<br>
However, it should be understood that the invention is not limited to the particular<br>
examples described above but may be used in connection with a wide variety of<br>
applications. Further, it should be understood that especially the work platform<br>
according to the invention may be designed in a multitude of varieties within the<br>
scope of the invention as specified in the claims.<br><br>
