				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a single pot process for the preparation of diazonaphthoquinonesulfonyl ester, useful organic materials in micro electronic industry and dye industry. This research pertains to a single-pot process for the preparation of diazonaphthoquinonesulfonyl esters having formula 1 as shown in this drawing below. This is the first report on the single-pot method of preparation of diazonapthoquinonesulfonyl esters. This study pertains to the one pot preparation of diazonaphthoquinonesulfonyl esters (formula 1) using, the corresponding diazonaphthoquinonesulfonic acid or its sodium salt, diphosgene or triphosgene, variety of hydroxy compounds, tertiary organic base and dichloromethane as a solvent medium.<br>
(FORMULA REMOVED)<br><br><br>
wherein X = O or N2   ; Y = O or N2; R1 = Sulfonyl Ester or H ; R2 = Sulfonyl ester or H<br>
There are a few methods of preparation of these esters available in the literature and some of the reports are discussed below with merits and demerits. All the methods of preparation of these esters reported in the literature involves first preparation of the precursor compound, the corresponding sulfonylchloride and further using the sulfonylchloride to make the sulfonyl ester. Thus, are having two steps in entire preparation of diazonaphthoquinone sulfonyl ester.<br>
One of the methods reported on the preparation of diazonaphthoquinone sulfonyl ester involves first preparation of sulfonylchloride using diazonaphthoquinonesulfonic acid or its sodium salt and chlorosulfonic acid (CA, vol 124, 32490e; PL 161,627, 1993; CA vol. 64, 2033, USSR 173,756, 1965; J. Park. Chem. 1991, vol. 333, p467, CA vol. 61, 16218h, year 1964, US 3,149,972). Thus prepared sulfonylchloride was converted in to the corresponding sulfonyl ester using organic base and appropriate R-OH hydroxy<br>
compound. This procedure clearly involves two sequential steps; particularly the preparation of sulfonylchloride has disadvantages like, reaction temperature and emission of gases like sulfurdioxide and hydrogen chloride.<br>
Another method involves first preparation of sulfonylchloride using thionylchloride (with DMF as catalyst) and subsequent conversion of sulfonylchloride into the corresponding sulfonyl ester. This method also has two steps in making the sulfonyl ester. The other demerits are like heating the reaction mixture, use of excess thionyl chloride, and evolution of gases like sulfurdioxide and hydrogen chloride (CA vol. 96, 34766b; Khin. Process year 1981, p505 (Russ)).<br>
Another procedure involves initial preparation of sulfonylchloride using chlorosulfonicacid and thionylchloride and its immediate conversion to the corresponding sulfonyl ester. This procedure is also of two-step process. The disadvantages of this procedure are the same as mentioned in the above discussion (CA, vol. 705, 208620w, Ger (East) 312,180 yearl988; CA vol. 125, 170873d, RO 104,624, year 1994; CA vol.775, 38553a, year 1993; US 5,082,932, year 1992; CA vol. 706, 105,781x, year 1992; CA vol, 770, 192,455m, year 1989; Pol PL 138,013 year 1987).<br>
Yet another procedure involves is the first preparation of sulfonyl chloride using phosgene (toxic gas) and followed by converting sulfonyl chloride to the corresponding ester. This method has two steps to make sulfonyl ester. The main limitation in this is the use of toxic phosgene gas (CA, vol. 702, 113034d, JP 59,196, 860, year 1984; CA vol. 105, 60439w, EP 178,356, year 1986).<br>
OBJECTIVES OF THE INVENTION<br>
The main objective of the present invention is to provide a single pot process for the preparation of diazonaphthoquinonesulfonyl ester.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide is simple and rapid work up process for the isolation of diazonaphthoquinonesulfonyl ester.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide diazonaphthoquinonesulfonyl ester having purity 96%.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention illustrates an altogether single-pot process for the preparation of diazonaphthoquinonesulfonyl esters by reacting the corresponding diazonaphthoquinonesulfonic acid or its sodium salt either with diphosgene or with triphosgene in the presence of triethylamine (organic base) and dichloromethane as a solvent or medium. This reaction is followed by the addition of hydroxy compound (R-OH) and triethylamine, in the same pot leading to the diazonaphthaquinonesulfonyl ester formation. Various solvents like, chloroform, 1, 2-dichloroethane, benzene, toluene, acetonitrile, benzonitrile, nitrobenzene etc., and others are also used. Organic bases like tributylamine pyridine, tripropylamine, N, N-dimethylaniline, N, N-diethylaniline etc., and other organic bases are also employed. Dichloromethane as solvent and triethylamine as base were preferred. The temperature of the reaction was varied over a range of-50°C to +10°C and -40°C is the preferred temperature condition. The organic base is found to be essential for conducting the reaction and the base has to be of tertiary base in nature. The mole ratio, maintained in the reaction is found to be a right combination. The reaction is conveniently monitored by UV-Visible absorption spectrometry. The work up procedure and isolation of product "diazonaphthoquinonesulfonyl ester" is simple and rapid. The purity of the product is &gt;96% as judged by HPLC and UV-Visible absorption measurements. The diazonaphthoquinonesulfonyl ester prepared was photolyzed (~ 366nm) in methanol solvent to confirm its photoactivating property. Products were characterized by the spectral data.<br>
