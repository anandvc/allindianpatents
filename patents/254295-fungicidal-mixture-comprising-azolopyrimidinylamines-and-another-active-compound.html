It is an object of the present invention, with a view to reducing the application rates and<br>
broadening the activity spectrum of the known compounds, to provide mixtures which,<br>
at a reduced total amount of active compounds applied, have improved activity against<br>
harmful fungi, in particular for certain indications.<br>
We have found that this object is achieved by the mixtures defined at the outset.<br>
Moreover, we have found that simultaneous, that is joint or separate, application of the<br>
compounds I and an active compound II or successive application of the compounds I<br>
and an active compound II allows better control of harmful fungi than is possible with<br>
the individual compounds (synergistic mixtures). The compounds I can be used as a<br>
synergist for a large number of different active compounds. The simultaneous, that is<br>
joint or separate, application of the compound I with an active compound II increases<br>
the fungicidal activity in a superadditive manner.<br>
The mixtures of the compounds I and an active compound II or the simultaneous, that<br>
is joint or separate, use of the compounds I and an active compound II are/is<br>
distinguished by excellent activity against a broad spectrum of phytopathogenic fungi,<br>
in particular from the classes of the Ascomycetes, Deuteromycetes, Oomycetes and<br>
Basidiomycetes. Some of them are systemically active and can be used in crop<br>
protection as foliar fungicides, as fungicides for seed dressing and as soil fungicides.<br>
They are particularly important in the control of a multitude of fungi on various crop<br>
plants, such as bananas, cotton, vegetables (for example cucumbers, beans and<br>
cucurbits), barley, grass, oats, coffee, potatoes, corn, fruit, rice, rye, soybeans,<br>
tomatoes, grape vines, wheat, ornamental plants, sugar cane and a multiplicity of<br><br>

particular from 10:1 to 1:10.<br>
The further active components are, if desired, added in a ratio of from 50:1 to 1:50,<br>
preferably from 20:1 to 1:20, to the compound I.<br>
Depending on the type of compound and the desired effect, the application rates of the<br>
mixtures according to the invention are from 5 g/ha to 2000 g/ha, preferably from 50 to<br>
900 g/ha, in particular from 50 to 750 g/ha.<br>
Correspondingly, the application rates for compounds I are generally from 1 to 1000<br>

rates of mixture are generally from 1 to 1000 g/100 kg of seed, preferably from 1 to 750<br>
g/100 kg, in particular from 5 to 500 g/100 kg.<br>
The method for controlling harmful fungi is carried out by the separate or joint<br>
application of the compounds I and active compounds II or the mixtures of compounds<br>
I and active compounds II by spraying or dusting the seeds, the plants or the soils<br>
before or after sowing of the plants or before or after emergence of the plants.<br>
The mixtures according to the invention, or the compounds I and active compounds II<br>
can be converted into the customary formulations, for example solutions, emulsions,<br>
suspensions, dusts, powders, pastes and granules. The use form depends on the<br>
particular intended purpose; in each case, it should ensure a fine and even distribution<br>
of the compound according to the invention.<br>
The formulations are prepared in a known manner, for example by extending the active<br>
compound with solvents and/or carriers, if desired using emulsifiers and dispersants.<br>
Solvents/auxiliaries suitable for this purpose are essentially:<br>

Formulations for the treatment of seed may additionally comprise binders and/or gelling<br>
agents and, if appropriate, colorants.<br>
In general, the formulations comprise from 0.01 to 95% by weight, preferably from 0.1<br><br>
PF 56951<br>
29<br>
to 90% by weight, of the active compounds. The active compounds are employed in a<br>
purity of from 90% to 100%, preferably 95% to 100%.<br>
For the treatment of seed, the formulations in question give, after two-to-tenfold<br>
dilution, active compound concentrations of from 0.01 to 60% by weight, preferably<br>
from 0.1 to 40% by weight, in the ready-to-use preparations.<br>
The following are examples of formulations according to the invention:<br>
1. Products for dilution with water<br>
A Water-soluble concentrates (SL, LS)<br>
10 parts by weight of a mixture according to the invention are dissolved in 90 parts by<br>

addition of 50 parts by weight of dispersants and wetters and prepared as water-<br>
dispersible or water-soluble granules by means of technical appliances (for example<br>
extrusion, spray tower, fluidized bed). Dilution with water gives a stable dispersion or<br>
solution of the active compound. The formulation has an active compound content of<br>
50% by weight.<br>
G Water-dispersible powders and water-soluble powders (WP, SP, SS, WS)<br>
75 parts by weight of a mixture according to the invention are ground in a rotor-stator<br>
mill with addition of 25 parts by weight of dispersants, wetters and silica gel. Dilution<br>

weight of dispersant, 1 part by weight of gelling agent and 70 parts by weight of water<br>
or an organic solvent are ground to give a fine suspension. On dilution with water, a<br>
stable suspension having an active compound content of 20% by weight is obtained.<br>
2. Products to be applied undiluted<br>
I Dustable powders (DP, DS)<br>
5 parts by weight of a mixture according to the invention are ground finely and mixed<br>
intimately with 95 parts by weight of finely divided kaolin. This gives a dustable product<br>
having an active compound content of 5% by weight.<br>
J Granules (GR, FG, GG, MG)<br>
0.5 part by weight of a mixture according to the invention is ground finely and<br>
associated with 99.5 parts by weight of carriers. Current methods are extrusion, spray-<br>
drying or the fluidized bed. This gives granules to be applied undiluted having an active<br>
compound content of 0.5% by weight.<br>
K ULV solutions (UL)<br>
10 parts by weight of a mixture according to the invention are dissolved in 90 parts by<br>
weight of an organic solvent, for example xylene. This gives a product to be applied<br>
undiluted having an active compound content of 10% by weight.<br>
For seed treatment, use is usually made of water-soluble concentrates (LS),<br>
suspensions (FS), dustable powders (DS), water-dispersible and water-soluble<br>
powders (WS, SS), emulsions (ES), emulsifiable concentrates (EC) and gel<br><br>
PF 56951<br>
31<br>
formulations (GF). These formulations can be applied to the seed in undiluted form or,<br>
preferably, diluted. Application can be carried out prior to sowing.<br>
Preference is given to using FS formulations for seed treatment. Usually, such<br>
formulations comprise from 1 to 800 g of active compound/I, from 1 to 200 g of<br>
surfactants/I, from 0 to 200 g of antifreeze agents/I, from 0 to 400 g of binder/I, from 0<br>
to 200 g of colorants/I and solvents, preferably water.<br>
Analogous formulations A to K of the compounds I or an active compound II comprise<br>
the respective amount of the individual active compounds. They are usually mixed<br>
directly prior to application during dilution to the ready-to-use active compound<br>
concentration (tank mix).<br>
The active compound concentrations in the ready-to-use preparations may be varied<br>
within relatively wide ranges. In general, they are between 0.0001 and 10%, preferably<br>
between 0.01 and 1%.<br>
The active compounds can be used as such, in the form of their formulations or the use<br>
forms prepared therefrom, for example in the form of directly sprayable solutions,<br>
powders, suspensions or dispersions, emulsions, oil dispersions, pastes, dustable<br>
products, materials for spreading, or granules, by means of spraying, atomizing,<br>
dusting, spreading or pouring. The use forms depend entirely on the intended<br>
purposes; they are intended to ensure in each case the finest possible distribution of<br>
the active compounds according to the invention.<br>
Aqueous use forms can be prepared from emulsion concentrates, pastes or wettable<br>
powders (wettable powders, oil dispersions) by adding water. To prepare emulsions,<br>
pastes or oil dispersions, the substances, as such or dissolved in an oil or solvent, can<br>
be homogenized in water by means of a wetter, tackifier, dispersant or emulsifier.<br>
However, it is also possible to prepare concentrates composed of active substance,<br>
wetter, tackifier, dispersant or emulsifier and, if appropriate, solvent or oil, and such<br>
concentrates are suitable for dilution with water.<br>
The active compounds may also be used successfully in the ultra-low-volume process<br>
(ULV), it being possible to apply formulations comprising over 95% by weight of active<br>
compound, or even to apply the active compound without additives.<br>
Oils of various types, wetters, adjuvants, herbicides, fungicides, other pesticides, or<br>
bactericides may be added to the active compounds, even, if appropriate, not until<br>
immediately prior to use (tank mix). These agents may be admixed with the<br>
compositions according to the invention in a weight ratio of from 1:100 to 100:1,<br>
preferably from 1:10 to 10:1.<br><br>
PF 56951<br>
32<br>
Suitable adjuvants in this sense are in particular: organically modified polysiloxanes,<br>
for example Break Thru S 240®; alcohol alkoxylates, for example Atplus 245®, Atplus<br>
MBA 1303®, Plurafac LF 300® and Lutensol ON 30®; EO/PO block polymers, for<br>
example Pluronic RPE 2035® and Genapol B®; alcohol ethoxylates, for example<br>
Lutensol XP 80®; and sodium dioctylsulfosuccinate, for example Leophen RA®.<br>
The compounds I and II or the mixtures or the corresponding formulations are applied<br>
by treating the harmful fungi, the plants, seeds, soils, areas, materials or spaces to be<br>
kept free from them with a fungicidally effective amount of the mixture or, in the case of<br>
separate application, of the compounds I and II. Application can be carried out before<br>
or after infection by the harmful fungi.<br>
Use examples<br>
The fungicidal effect of the compounds and the mixtures was demonstrated by the<br>
following tests:<br>
The active compounds amisulbrom, Cu hydroxide, famoxadone, phosphorous acid and<br>
zoxamide were used as commercial formulations and diluted with water to the stated<br>
concentrations.<br>
The active compounds were separately or jointly prepared as a stock solution<br>
comprising 25 mg of active compound which was made up to 10 ml using a mixture of<br>
acetone and/or DMSO and the emulsifier Uniperol® EL (wetting agent having<br>
emulsifying and dispersing action based on ethoxylated alkylphenols) in a volume ratio<br>
of solvent/emulsifier of 99 to 1. The mixture was then made up with water to 100 ml.<br>
This stock solution was diluted with the solvent/emulsifier/water mixture described to<br>
the concentration of active compound stated below.<br>
Use example 1 - Persistency against late blight on tomatoes caused by Phytophthora<br>
infestans<br>
Leaves of potted plants of the cultivar "Great beef tomato St. Pierre" were sprayed to<br>
runoff point with an aqueous suspension having the concentration of active compound<br>
stated below. After 5 days, the leaves were inoculated with an aqueous spore suspension<br>
of Phytophthora infestans. The plants were then placed in a water vapor-saturated<br>
chamber at temperatures between 18 and 20°C. After 6 days, the late blight on the<br>
untreated but infected control plants had developed to such an extent that the infection<br>
could be determined visually in %.<br>
The visually determined percentages of infected leaf areas were converted into<br><br>
PF 56951<br>
33<br>
efficacies in % of the untreated control:<br>
The efficacy (E) is calculated as follows using Abbot's formula:<br>
E = (1-α/β).100<br>
α corresponds to the fungicidal infection of the treated plants in % and<br>
β corresponds to the fungicidal infection of the untreated (control) plants in %<br>
An efficacy of 0 means that the infection level of the treated plants corresponds to that<br>
of the untreated control plants; an efficacy of 100 means that the treated plants were<br>
not infected.<br>
The expected efficacies of active compound combinations were determined using<br>
Colby's formula (Colby, S.R. "Calculating synergistic and antagonistic responses of<br>
herbicide combinations", Weeds, 15, 20-22, 1967) and compared with the observed<br>
efficacies.<br>
Colby's formula:<br>
E = x + y-x. y/100<br>
