FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The invented method is related to Wireless and Cellular communication. More particularly the present invention relates to a method for customization of ring tones and display profile by calling party.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
In a typical mobile communication system a large geographical area is divided into cells. Each cell is further divided into sectors. Inside each cell there is a base station. An access terminal typically communicates with the network through the sectors. At any given instant of time, access terminal communicates with one or more sectors which may belong to one or more cells (Refer Figure 1: Wireless Network).<br>
In a normal call scenario, when one MS (Mobile Station) wants to originate a call (Calling party mobile), it will send an Origination message to NW (network) and NW will assign appropriate resources to calling party mobile and to the called party Mobile. Once the traffic channel establishment is through, NW sends the Alert with Information message (AWIM) to the called party mobile. Upon reception of AWIM, the called party MS starts playing the nng tone, which is already stored in the mobile. When the called party accepts the call, the two can start conversation.<br><br>
(Refer Figure 2: Message Sequence Chart for Normal Call Establishment)<br>
Call Set up Sequence:-<br>
1.	MS1 (calling party) sends an Origination Message to Network (NW).<br>
2.	NW assigns appropriate traffic channel resources to the MS1 through Channel Assignment Message (CAM) and establishes traffic with MS1.<br>
3.	NW send a Page Message to the Called Party (MS2) and wait for a Page Response Message from MS2.<br>
4.	NW assigns appropriate traffic channel resources to the MS2 through Channel Assignment Message (CAM) and establishes traffic with MS2.<br>
5.	After Service negotiation procedures, NW sends an Alert with Information Message (AWIM) to MS2 (Called party) with ring.<br>
6.	Upon  reception  of AWIM,   MS2  starts  playing  the  hng  tone  already configured in the mobile.<br>
7.	Once user answers the call, MS2 stops ringing and sends a Connect order to NW.<br>
8.	After this both MS1 and MS2 can start conversation.<br>
Normal Voice Call setup can be for a<br>
1.	Mobile originated Call (MO Call)<br>
2.	Mobile Terminated Call (MT Call)<br>
Call Setup Steps for a Successful mobile originated call (MO Call)<br><br>
1.	MS1 (Calling party Mobile) originates the call by sending a Origination Message (ORM) to the NW.<br>
2.	Upon reception of ORM, NW Assigns a traffic Channel to the MS1 by sending a Channel Assignment Message (CAM), if resources are available.<br>
3.	And NW also starts sending NULL frames to MS1.<br>
4.	Once MS1 decodes 2 good frames, it sends back preambles.<br>
5.	Once BS receives preambles from MS1, it sends an acknowledgement order and both MS1 and BS start using traffic channel further.<br>
6.	Service negotiation is then done via Sen/ice Connect Message/Service Connect Completion Message and or Service Request/Service Response depending on the "assign mode" field value in CAM.<br>
7.	After service negotiation is done, BS sends AWIM on fonward Traffic Channel (FTCH) to the Called party Mobile (MS2) indicating the calling party's number (MS1) and upon reception of AWIM, MS2 starts playing the ring tone which is already stored in the mobile<br>
8.	Once the Called party (MS2) accepts the Call, MS2 sends back a Connect Order to the NW and the voice traffic is established for the two parties.<br>
9.	Both Calling party (MS1) and Called party (MS2) will be in Conversation State, utilizing the traffic channel resources until the call is ended via sending a Release order to the NW by the calling party.<br>
Call Setup Steps for a Successful mobile Terminated call (MT Call)<br><br>
1.	NW will send a Page Message to the MS2 (Called party Mobile or receiver) upon receiving a call origination request through ORM from another mobile (MS1).<br>
2.	Upon reception of a Page Message, MS2 sends a Page Response Message (PRM).<br>
3.	Upon reception of Page Response Message, NW Assigns a traffic Channel to the MS2 by sending a Channel Assignment Message (CAM), if resources are available.<br>
4.	And NW also start sending NULL frames to MS2<br>
5.	Once MS2 decodes 2 good frames, it sends back preambles.<br>
6.	Once BS receives preambles from MS2, it sends an acknowledgement order and both MS2 and BS start using traffic channel further.<br>
7.	Service negotiation is then done via Service Connect Message/Service Connect Completion Message and or Service Request/Service Response depending on the "assign mode" field value in CAM.<br>
8.	After service negotiation is done, BS sends AWIM on forward Traffic Channel (FTCH) to the Called party Mobile (MS2) indicating the calling party's number (MS1) and upon reception of AWIM, MS2 starts playing the ring tone which is already stored in the mobile<br>
9.	Once the called party (MS2) accepts the Call, MS2 sends back a Connect Order to the NW and the voice traffic is established for the two parties.<br>
10.	Both Calling party (MS1) and Called party (MS2) will be in Conversation State, utilizing the traffic channel resources until the call is ended via sending a Release order to the NW by the calling party.<br><br>
There are following limitations to the existing art:<br>
1.	It doesn't give flexibility to the user to have different experience (e.g. ring tones) for every call.<br>
2.	Only caller's number is displayed in to the called party's screen.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Subscriber 1 has some ring tone and /or his display profile (display profile can be his address or small photograph) stored in his MS or uploaded to the NW.<br>
Whenever subscriberl (hereafter MS1) wants to originate a call to called party (here after MS2), MS1 specified ring tone and display profile can also reach to MS2, and can be utilized for alerting the user; if MS2 has appropriate settings to allow this.<br>
Assumptions:<br>
1.	User Interface at MS1 provides a mechanism to specify ring tone and display profile. Phone book can be one mechanism for these settings. (Note: it is not restricted to phone book, and any other mechanism for setting can be provided.<br>
2.	User interface at MS2 provides a mechanism for the user to give permission for certain calling parties to override the existing ring tone /<br><br>
display. Phone book can be one mechanism for these settings. (Note: it is not restricted to phone book, and any other mechanism for setting can be provided. Mechanism is not in the scope of this document) 3. Settings at MS2 can specify some more parameters e.g. alert mode (ring tone/ vibrator) can be override or not, combination of both modes can be used or not, for how long new ring tone can be used for alerting the MS (this is to avoid negligence by user of MS2, because it is possible that he wont recognize that his MS is alerting. With this setting after few seconds default ring tone will again override the current ring tone, and MS2 will start alerting using default ring tone)<br>
Note: Mechanisms are given for cdma2000 system, but the INVENTED METHOD is applicable to other mobile communication systems as well. Different messages can be used in other systems but the method will also be applicable to those systems.<br>
The implementation can be executed in one of the 4 ways given below:<br>
1. MS1 specified ring tone and display profile are stored in network. When MS1 originates a call to MS2 the specified ring tone and display profile reach to MS2 using AWIM. This can be achieved by Including a new record in AWIM utilizing any of the reserved values and include the ring tone or display profile as data part of this record.<br>
2.  Flash with Information Message (FWIM) with ring tones/display profile shall be<br><br>
sent from MSI (calling party) duhng call setup to Network and then AWIM/FWIM is used to send it to MS2 from Network. This can be achieved by Including a new record in FWIM and AWIM utilizing any of the reserved values and include the ring tone or display profile as data part of this record<br>
3. During call setup, network sends an SMS with the specified ring tone to the called party on FTCH just before sending the AWIM. This ensures that the SMS is received at the called party before it's asked to alert the caller. (Note: MMS can also be used for same purpose. If display profile contains caller's photograph then also MMS can be used, but the mechanism is same for SMS and MMS)<br>
4. SMS with ring tones/display profile can be sent from MS1, and MS2 checks if it has received any valid SMS (containing ring tones) from the same number from where it is receiving messages for call origination within a specified time.<br>
If SMS is received within the specified time then MS2 uses the ring tone specified in the SMS/MMS to alert the user else it will use the default ring tone configured in the phone. (Note: MMS can also be used for same purpose. If display profile contains caller's photograph then also MMS can be used, but the mechanism is same for SMS and MMS)<br><br>
Accordingly, this invention explains a method for customization of ring tones and display profile by calling party in wireless communication comprising the steps of:<br>
(a)	storing Calling party Mobile (MS1) specified hng tones and display profile in network; and<br>
(b)	sending the specified ring tone and display profile to Called party mobile (MS2) using AWIM when MS1 originates a call to MS2,<br>
Wherein the said method is carried out by including a new information record in AWIM utilizing any of the reserved values and include the ring tone or display profile as data part of the said record.<br>
MS1 originates the call by sending an Origination Message (ORM) to the network (NW). Upon reception of ORM, NW Assigns a traffic Channel to the MS1 by sending a Channel Assignment Message (CAM), if network resources are available. If network resources are available the traffic channel is establishment and service negotiations are carried out for MS1. The NW sends a page message to MS2 and upon reception of Page Response Message, NW assigns a traffic Channel to the MS2 by sending a Channel Assignment Message (CAM) which is flowed by traffic channel establishment. Service negotiation is then done via Service Connect Message/Service Connect Completion Message and or Service Request/Service Response depending on the "assign mode" field value in CAM. After service negotiation is done, BS sends AWIM on forward Traffic Channel (FTCH) to MS2 containing the hng tone and /or display profile specified by the calling party as AWIM records. Upon reception of AWIM, MS2 starts playing the ring tone and displays the calling party's profile if the received AWIM contains<br><br>
ringtone and/or display profile record. Once MS2 accepts the Call, MS2 sends back a connect order to the NW and the voice traffic is established for the two parties. Both MS1 and MS2 continue in conversation state, utilizing the traffic channel resources until the call is ended by sending a release order to the NW by the calling party.<br>
Accordingly, this invention further explains a method for customization of ring tones and display profile by calling party in wireless communication comprising the steps of:<br>
(a)	sending Flash with Information Message (FWIM) with ring tones/display<br>
profile from MS1 (calling party) to network during call setup; and<br>
(b)	sending ring tones/display profile to MS2 from Network using AWIM/FWIM;<br>
wherein the said method is carried out by including a new information record type,<br>
utilizing any of the reserved values for the information record types and including<br>
the said record containing the ring tone or display profile in FWIM/AWIM.<br>
Accordingly, this invention further explains a method for customization of ring tones and display profile by calling party in wireless communication comprising the steps of:<br>
(a)	uploading the ring tone and/or display profile to the network by the subscriber of this feature (MS1); and<br>
(b)	sending an SMS/MMS with the specified ring tone and/or display profile to the called party (MS2) on FTCH just before sending the AWIM by the network duhng call setup,<br><br>
wherein specific Ring tones is included as the data part of the SMS/MMS and is sent as soon as the traffic channel is setup.<br>
Accordingly, this invention further explains a method for customization of hng tones and display profile by calling party in wireless communication comprising the steps of:<br>
(a)	sending SMS/MMS from MS1 to MS2;<br>
(b)	checking if MS2 has received any valid SMS/MMS containing ring tones from the same number from where it is receiving messages for call origination within a specified time; and<br>
(c)	using the hng tone specified in the SMS/MMS to alert the user if SMS/MMS is received within the specified time,<br>
wherein if the SMS/MMS is received after the call is established or before the time pehod set for expecting a SMS/MMS containing ring tone and/or display profile, then those SMS/MMS may be treated like normal SMS/MMS and the hng tones/display profile specified in them will not be utilized by MS2 and MS2 starts playing the ring tone stored in it upon after expiration of the time period set.<br>

Mechanism 1<br>
MS1 specified ring tone and display profile are stored in network. When MS1 originates a call to MS2 the specified ring tone and display profile reach to MS2 using AWIM. This can be achieved by Including a new information record in AWIM utilizing any of the reserved values and include the ring tone or display profile as data part of this record.<br>
For e.g.: 00000011 record types is used to include Calling Party Number in AWIM/FWIM. Similarly a new record type can be included to accommodate the ring tones, display profile etc.<br><br>
Call Setup Steps for a Mechanism KRefer Figure 3)<br>
1.	MS1 (Calling party Mobile) originates the call by sending a Origination Message (ORM) to the NW.<br>
2.	Upon reception of ORM, NW Assigns a traffic Channel to the MS1 by sending a Channel Assignment Message (CAM), if resources are available.<br>
3.	And traffic channel establishment and service negotiation follows for MSI<br>
4.	Meanwhile NW sends a page message to MS2 (Called party mobile).<br>
5.	Upon reception of Page Response Message, NW Assigns a traffic Channel to the MS2 by sending a Channel Assignment Message (CAM) which is flowed by traffic channel establishment.<br>
6.	Service negotiation is then done via Service Connect Message/Service Connect Completion Message and or Service Request/Service Response depending on the "assign mode" field value in CAM.<br>
7.	After service negotiation is done, BS sends AWIM on fon/vard Traffic Channel (FTCH) to the Called party Mobile (MS2) containing the ring tone and /or display profile specified by the calling party as AWIM records.<br>
8.	Upon reception of AWIM, MS2 starts playing the ring tone and displays the calling party's profile if the received AWIM contains ringtone and/or display profile record.<br>
9.	Once the Called party (MS2) accepts the Call, MS2 sends back a Connect Order to the NW and the voice traffic is established for the two parties.<br>
10.	Both Calling party (MS1) and Called party (MS2) will be in Conversation<br><br>
state, utilizing the traffic channel resources until the call is ended via sending a Release order to the NW by the calling party.<br>
Advantage:<br>
1.	Very flexible<br>
2.	Much scope for including more useful information<br>
3.	The calling party's name, address and other details (like signature included in mails) may also be included (optional).<br>
Effect:<br>
Requires a new information record type to be added in to AWIM.The reserved fields of the information record types can be utilized for including a new information record to carry the calling party data like ring tone, display profile etc.<br>
Mechanism 2<br>
Flash with Information Message (FWIM) with ring tones/display profile shall be sent from MS1 (calling party) during call setup to Network and then AWIM/FWIM is used to send it to MS2 from Network. This can be achieved by Including a new information record type, utilizing any of the reserved values for the information record types and include this record containing the ring tone or display profile in FWIM/AWIM.<br><br>
Call Setup Steps for a Mechanism 2(Refer Figure 4 )<br>
1.	MS1 (Calling party Mobile) originates the call by sending a Origination Message (ORM) to the NW.<br>
2.	Upon reception of ORM, NW Assigns a traff'ic Channel to the MS1 by sending a Channel Assignment Message (CAM), if resources are available.<br>
3.	And traffic channel establishment and service negotiation follows for MS1.<br>
4.	After establishing traffic channel with NW, Calling party (MS1) shall send a FWIM (Flash With Information Message) on RICH containing the ring tone and/or display profile.<br>
5.	Meanwhile NW sends a page message to MS2 (Called party mobile).<br>
6.	Upon reception of Page Response Message, NW Assigns a traffic Channel to the MS2 by sending a Channel Assignment Message (CAM) which is flowed by traffic channel establishment.<br>

8.	After service negotiation is done, BS shall send a AWIM/FWIM to MS2 (called party) containing MS1 (calling party) specified ring tone and/or display profile.<br>
9.	Then BS shall send AWIM on forward Traffic Channel (FTCH) to the Called party Mobile (MS2).<br>
10.	Upon reception of AWIM, MS2 starts playing the ring tone received in the<br><br>
AWIM/FWIM and display the calling party's profile if the AWIM/FWIM contained any display profile record.<br>
11.	Once the Called party (MS2) accepts the Call, MS2 sends back a Connect Order to the NW and the voice traffic is established for the two parties.<br>
12.	Both Calling party (MS1) and Called party (MS2) will be in Conversation State, utilizing the traffic channel resources until the call is ended via sending a Release order to the NW by the calling party.<br>
Advantage:<br>
1.	Very flexible<br>
2.	Much scope for including more useful information<br>
3.	The calling party's name, address and other details (like signature included in mails) may also be included (optional).<br>
Effect:<br>
1. Requires a new information record type to be added in to AWIM/FWIM.The reserved fields of the information record types can be utilized for including a new information record to carry the calling party data like ring tone, display profile etc.<br>
2. MS need to send one more message (FWIM) during call setup specifying the ring tone to be played at the called party.<br><br>
Mechanism 3<br>
Subscriber of this feature (MS1) is given the option to upload his ring tone and/or display profile to the network. And during call setup, network sends an SMS/MMS with the specified ring tone and/or display profile to the called party (MS2) on FTCH just before sending the AWIM. This ensures that the SMS/MMS is received at the called party before it's asked to alert the caller.<br>
Subscriber specific Ring tones can be included as the data part of the SMS/MMS and it should be sent as soon as the traffic channel is setup.<br>
Call Setup Steps for a Mechanism 3(Refer Figure 5)<br>
1.	MS1 (Calling party Mobile) originates the call by sending a Origination Message (ORM) to the NW.<br>
2.	Upon reception of ORM, NW Assigns a traffic Channel to the MS1 by sending a Channel Assignment Message (CAM), if resources are available.<br>
3.	And traffic channel establishment and service negotiation follows for MS1.<br>
4.	Meanwhile NW sends a page message to MS2 (Called party mobile).<br>
5.	Upon reception of Page Response Message, NW Assigns a traffic Channel to the MS2 by sending a Channel Assignment Message (CAM) which is followed by traffic channel establishment.<br>
6.	As soon as traffic channel is established, NW shall send the SMS/MMS with MS1 (calling party mobile) specified ring tone and/or display profile.<br><br>
7.	Service negotiation is then done via Service Connect Message/Service Connect Completion Message and or Service Request/Service Response depending on the "assign mode" field value in CAM.<br>
8.	After service negotiation is done, BS sends AWIM on forward Traffic Channel (FTCH) to the Called party Mobile (MS2) and upon reception of AWIM; MS2 starts playing the ring tone in the SMS/MMS received during call setup from NW and display the calling party's profile if the SMS contained any display profile.<br>
9.	Once the Called party (MS2) accepts the Call, MS2 sends back a Connect Order to the NW and the voice traffic is established for the two parties.<br>
10.	Both Calling party (MS1) and Called party (MS2) will be in Conversation State, utilizing the traffic channel resources until the call is ended via sending a Release order to the NW by the calling party.<br>
Advantage:<br>
Minimum implementation complexity, no change in standard<br>
Effect:<br>
One extra message (SMS/MMS) needs to be transmitted during call setup.<br>
Mechanism 4<br><br>
SMS/MMS can be sent from MS1, and MS2 checks if it has received any valid SMS/MMS (containing ring tones) from the same number from where it is receiving messages for call origination within a specified time.<br>
If SMS/MMS is received within the specified time then MS2 uses the ring tone specified in the SMS/MMS to alert the user   (Refer Figure 6,7 and 8).<br>
Note: If the SMS/MMS is received after the call is established or before the time period set for expecting a SMS/MMS containing ring tone and/or display profile, then those SMS/MMS may be treated like normal SMS/MMS and the ring tones/display profile specified in them will not be utilized by MS2.. In this case MS2 will start playing the ring tone stored in it upon after expiration of the time period set.<br>
Call Setup Steps for a Mechanism 4(Refer Figure 6, 7 and 8)<br>
1.	MS1  (Calling party Mobile) originates the call by sending a Origination Message (ORM) to the NW.<br>
2.	MS1 shall send an SMS also after sending ORM specifying the ring tone to be played at the called party and/or display profile.<br>
3.	Upon reception of ORM, NW Assigns a traffic Channel to the MS1 by sending a Channel Assignment Message (CAM), if resources are available.<br>
4.	And traffic channel establishment and service negotiation follows for MS1.<br>
5.	SMS from MS1 with ring tone sfiall reach MS2 on paging channel before<br><br>
receiving the page msg from NW(This may be ignored if it do not fall within time T1 set at MS2).<br>
6.	Meanwhile NW sends a page message to MS2 (Called party mobile).<br>
