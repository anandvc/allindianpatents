FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to immune modulators in particular vaccines that modulate a cellular immune response and uses thereof.<br>
BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION<br>
Vaccines and other inamune modulators have a major impair in reducing morbidity and mortality from disease. The primary immunity elicited b}' most current vaccines appear to be mediated by the humoral immune response. For diseases that may require a cellular immune response, such as tuberculosis and leishmaniasis, there are  urrently no available vaccines that are uniformly effective.<br>
Typically, adjuvants are added to vaccines. The role of the adjuvant is to enhance the Dody's immune response to specific antigens of the vaccine. Commonly used adjuvants typically produce a humoral immune response but not a cell-mediated .immune response. In addition, aluminium adjuvants for example may cause negative side effects, such as sterile abscesses, erythema, swelling, subcutaneous nodules, granulomatous inflammation and contact hypersensitivity.<br>
\ vaccine or outlier immune modulator is sought that modifies a cellular immune response and in particular the T helper cell response, for example, the T helper cell 1 Thl) and T helper cell 2 (Th2) response.<br>
NUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
  birth to death the immune system is educated, constantly stimulated and egulated through contact with the environment. Modem urbanisation and public health measures to prevent infectious disease have virtually eliminated this exposure<br><br>
leading to an vmprecedented rise in diseases - such as allergies and euplastic diseases. Restoring the beneficial affects of the environment through the use of killed suspensions of harmless beneficial environmental bacteria may redress the normal balance of the immune system thus acting, therapeutically and/or prophylactically in the treatment of diseases and/or in promoting a healthy immune system.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention is predicated upon the surprising finding that a whole cell of a bacterium from any one of the actinomycete genera Rhodococcus, Gordonia. Nocardia, Dietzia, Tsukamurella and Nocardioides administered to a test subject can eruct a modification of the immune system, in particular the cellular immune system of that test subject.<br>
The phrase "cellular immune system", as used herein, includes a cell-mediated immun' response which depends upon the presence of T lymphocytes. The term "T lymphocytes includes cytotoxic T lymphocytes, helper T cells, suppresser T cells and regulatory T cells Modification of a cell-mediated immune response may be used, for example, to overcom cell-mediated immune disorders including, for example an immune system imbalance am immune hypersensitivity.<br>
The terms "modulate", "modify", "modification" and other derivatives thereof, as used herein, mean downregulating, inhibiting, inducing, stimulating, upregulating, altering or otherwise affecting a component or components of the cellular immune system.<br>
DETAILED ASPECTS OF THE PRESENT INVENTION<br>
In one aspect, the present invention provides an immune modulator composition comprising a whole cell of a bacterium fi:om tlie genera Rhodococcus, Gordonia, Nocardia, Dietzia, Tsukamurella and Nocardioides.<br>
The term "immune modulator", as used herein, means a substance which modulates a cellular immune system of a subject.<br><br>
The term "whole cell", as used herein, means a bacterium which is intact, or<br>
substantially intact. In particular, the term "intact" as used herein means a bacterium<br>
hich is comprised of all of the components present in a whole cell, particularly a<br>
â– hole, viable cell, and/or a bacterium which has not been specifically treated to<br>
;move one or more components from it. By tlie term "substantially intact" as used<br>
srein it is meant that although the isolation and/or purification process used in<br>
obtaining the bacterium may result in, for example, a slight modification to the cell<br>
and'or in the removal of one or more of the components of the cell, the degree to<br>
which such a modification and/or removal occurs is insignificant. In particular, a<br>
substantially intact cell according to the present invention has not been specifically<br>
treated to remove one or more components from it.<br>
Although it has been suggested that individual components of bacterial cells could be used to elicit an adjuvant effect, prior to the present invention the use of whole cells of bacterium from the genera Rhodococcus, Gordonia, Nocardia, Dietzia, Tsiikanmrella and Nocardioides to modulate a cellular immune response was not contemplated. Surprisingly, it has been found that by using a whole cell of a bacterium from said genera, modulation of a cellular immune system can be effected. The modulation of a cellular immune response caused by adminisfration of said whole cell of said bacterium may be advantageously long lasting as compared with the response elicited by administration of an individual component of the bacterium.<br>

THERAPEUTIC USES<br>
The immune modulators of the present invention may be used in therapy. In particular such compounds may be used to modulate T lymphocyte responses in vivo and/or other cells involved in an inmiune response in vivo.<br>
Immune modulator/pharmaceutical compositions capable of modulating, in particular blocking, T cell proliferation and/or differentiation and/or activity may be used against any disorder which is susceptible to prevention or treatment by the modulation of an adaptive immune response, i.e. a cellular immune response.<br>
Suitably, the compositions according to the present invention are used to modulate a cellular immune response to treat or prevent one or more of an infectious disease (such as a bacterial infection eg. methycillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, tuberculosis, including multidrug resistant tuberculosis and leprosy; chronic viral infections, for example hepatitis, HIV and infections caused by papilloma viruses, including equine sarcoid, genital warts and dysplasia of the uterine cervix that precedes carcmoma of the cervix; latent viral infections, such as shingles {Herpes zoster) or cold sores (Herpes simplex) for example; or parasitic infections, for example malaria, trypanosomiasis, leishmaniasis and toxoplasmosis), an allergy, such as allergic dermatitis or allergic asthma, stress - such as major trauma stress, psychosocial stress and clironic stress, and cancer (for example, the composition may be administered regularly throughout adult life to counter the effects of tobacco).<br>
A more extensive list of disorders is given in WO-A-98/099S5. For ease of reference, part of that list is now provided: inflammation associated with hypersensitivity.<br><br>
allergic reactions, asthma, inflammation associated with aphthus ulceration, ulcerative colitis, hepatic fibrosis, liver cirrhosis or other hepatic diseases, dermatitis, in particular atopic dermatitis e.g. eczema, periodontal diseases or other dental diseases, to treat or ameliorate monocyte or leukocyte proliferative diseases, e.g. leukaemia, other cancers.<br>
Infectious diseases<br>
Compositions capable of modulating, in particular stimulating (i.e. inducing or enhancing) T cell proliferation and'or differentiation or of preventing the induction of or reversing T cell anergy may be used generally to boost or induce T cell immune responses. Virtually all adaptive immune responses require the activation of T cells and their differentiation into cytokine-producing cells. Thus, these compositions may be used generally to prevent and'or treat infectious diseases - such as vu'al or bacterial. Suitably, these compositions may be used to prevent and treat parasitic infections, e.g. malaria, leishmaniasis, toxoplasmosis and trypanosomiasis). Suitably, these compositions may be used to prevent or treat viral infections, for example infections caused by papilloma viruses, including equine sarcoid, genital warts and dysplasia of the uterine cervix that precedes carcinoma of the cervix.<br>
In one aspect of the present invention the infection is preferably trypanosomiasis.<br>
In another aspect of the present invention the infection is preferably one caused by papilloma viruses, particularly bovine papilloma viruses 1 and 2. In a fiuther aspect of the present invention the infection is preferably one or more of equine sarcoid, genital warts and dysplasia of the uterine cervix that precedes carcinoma of the cervix.<br>
Equine Sarcoid<br>
The compositions of the present invention may also be used to prevent and treat equine sarcoid.<br><br>
Equine sarcoid is the commonest skin neoplasm of horses and is associated with infection with bovine papilloma viruses 1 and 2 (Chambers et al J. Gen. Virol. 2003: 84: 1055-1062). This condition is currently without an effective treatment, although surgery, non-specific immune treatment and cytotoxic drugs may all have some effect.<br>
The compositions of the present invention are preferably administered in tlie same lymph node drainage area as a lesion or neoplasm.<br>
Allergy<br>
The compositions of the present invention may also be used to prevent and treat allergies (eg. asthma including allergic astlima, hayfever, allergic dennatitis (eczema), anaphylactic shock, allergies to plant contact or ingestion, stings - such as nettle and insect stings, and allergies to insect bites - such as midges for instance Culicoides (which causes Sweet Itch in horses).<br>
Sweet Itch is one of the commonest skin diseases seen in horses, particularly in wild horses and/or ponies. About 3% of horses in the U.K. are affected to some degree. Most horses show signs between 1 and 4 years of age and the condition generally worsens diuing summer. Certain breeds are particularly prone to the disease. Shires, Hackneys and Welsh and Icelandic ponies have all been suggested as susceptible breeds. Sweet Itch is caused by hypersensitivity to the bites of the tiny fly Culicoides. In the UEl, the fly is present from April to October but peaks in numbers in May to September. The flies feed on the horse at specific sites usually around the tail head and under the mane. There are 20 species of Culicoides present in the UK and some feed underneath the horses' abdomen.<br>
By way of example only, the compositions of the present invention may also be used to prevent and/or treat anaphylactic shock by administering a subject, which subject has a predisposition to suffer from anaphylactic shock (for instance a subject who is known to have an allergy, such as an allergy to peanuts for instance) with a composition  according to  the  present  invention,  thus  to  reduce  the  subject's<br><br>
predisposition to anaphylactic shock should they (accidentalh"^ come into contact with the antigen, e.g. peanuts for instance, towards which they ma&gt;' react adversely.<br>
Heaves/COPD<br>
The compositions of the present invention may also be used to prevent and treat heaves and/or COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease).<br>
Heaves is an equine lung disease with similarities to human astlnna and COPD. The clinical signs in the horse are initiated by an allergic response to the particles in hay dust in lungs ahready damaged with a degree of fibrosis. It is most often seen in older horses (greater than six years old) that are stabled during the winter months. Hay contains microorganisms - such as bacteria and fungi as well as tiny particles of feed grains, plants, faeces, dander, and pollen. These tiny particles become aerosolised in hay dust and elicit an allergic response and fibrosis when they are inhaled by horses with heaves. The primary microorganisms believed to be involved in the etiolog}' of heaves are Aspergillus fumigatus, Thermoactinomyces vulgaris and Faenia rectivij-gula. Both reduction of the bronchospasm of asthma and the fibrosis of COPD are within the scope of the patent.<br>
Stress<br>
Stress is often presented as a symptom of modem living, the high pressure executive lifestyle, the consequences of which are widely perceived as leading to major pathological conditions such as gastric ulcers, hypertension, heart disease and strokes. Other major stressful events in life such as divorce, bereavement and moving house are seen as liigh risk factors for heart disease.<br>
These are not misconceptions, the fanning industry is well aware of the economic losses resulting from subjecting hvestock to major stresses such as overcrowding, confinement and transportation leading to an increased susceptibility to infection and the precipitation of underlying pathology.    Research by doctors and scientists is<br><br>
producing an increasing volume of published work showing definable stresses such as confinement can result in significant changes in endocrine (hormone) activity which subsequently can affect tlie body's immune fimctions. This can be noticeably demonstrated in major trauma stress (including surgical stress) in which the cell mediated immune response is dramatically paralysed Faist (1996).<br>
Elenkov IJ (1999) report recent evidence indicating that glucocorticoids and catecholamines, the end products of the stress system, and histamine, a product of activated mast cells, might selectively suppress cellular immunity, and favour humoral inunune responses. This is mediated by a differential effect of stress hormones and histamine, on Thl/Th2 patterns and type 1/type 2-cytokine production. Thus, systemically, stress might induce a Th2 shift, while, locally, under certain conditions, it might induce pro-inflammatoiy activities through neural activation of the peripheral corticotrophin-releasing factor-mast cell-histamine axis.<br>
Paik (2000) and Kay (2001) in independent studies of academic stress, examined the immunological profiles of students during non exam and exam periods. They report a significant reduction in IL-2 and interferon gamma production and an increase in IL-6. This indicates that the body's immune system responds to stressful episodes by a down regulation of Th-I cytokines and a selective up-regulation of the Th2 cytokines.<br>
Iwakabe (199S), using a mouse model of restraint stress, reports the skewing of the immune response towards Th2 dominant immunity.<br>
This stress hormone induced switch towards Th2 immune imbalance is also reported in non major, chronic stress situations such as psychosocial stress amongst workers overwintering at the AustraUan National Antarctic Research Expedition stations, (Mehta (2000)). They also report an associated increase in latent virus reactivations.<br>
Similar stress hormone and immunological changes are reported fi:om chronic stress in care givers of dementia patients (Bauer (2000)) and in astronauts during the Euromir<br><br>
95 mission (Norbiato (1998)). Of particular concern was the astronauts increased susceptibility to infection.<br>
The body is designed to recover from stress and in acute stress clearly does as the risk of infection recedes with the patient's recovery from the major trauma.<br>
Chronic sfress however appears to maintain the Th2 dominated immime imbalance. This is a very serious consequence as all of the quoted authors allude to stress through the above mechanisms, possibly influencing the onset and'or course of infectious, inflammatory, allergic and neoplastic diseases.<br>
This consequence is further supported by Lawrence (2000).<br>
An immunoregulator, preferably, an orally administered inmunoregulator, according to the present invention, which stimulates the Thl response and down regulates Th2 may restore the healthy balance of the immune system and thus reduce the increased risk of serious illness associated with chronic stress.<br>
Preferably, the composition according to the present invention is used to treat and/or prevent stress, in particular major trauma stress, psychosocial stress and chronic sfress.<br>
Preferably, the composition according to the present invention is used to treat and/or prevent sfress in animals, suitably in humans and/or livestock.<br>
Immune system imbalance<br>
An inunune system imbalance - such as an upregulation, downregulation or inappropriately regulated cellular immune response - may occur at any time in the life of a subject. Suitably, the compositions may be used to modulate an immune system imbalance. Tliat is to say, the compositions according to the present invention may be used to freat and/or prevent an immune system imbalance.<br><br>
Suitably, the immune modulator composition or a pharmaceutical composition may be used to modulate an immune system imbalance, in children, including babies, infants and juveniles. An immune system imbalance - such as an upregulation, downregulation or inappropriately regulated cellular immune response - may occur in children following vaccination, for example following childhood vaccinations. Such an immune system imbalance may result in conditions such as the onset of allergies, i.e. allergic dermatitis and allergic asthma.<br>
With the aim of protecting children from infections, repeated injections against Diptheria, Tetanus, Pertussis, Polio, Measles, Mumps and the Rubella are given. All of these are judged necessary and pressure is exerted by Health authorities to ensure that children are presented for vaccination at the appropriate time. However, most vaccinations given in early life contain an alum adjuvant, which has important immunological consequences. Alum is a potent stimulus to the Th2 pattern of response and the consequential immune dysregulation causes tlie child to become vulnerable to the development of allergies and possibly cancer for example.<br>
It is possible to re-educate the immune system to a proper recognition, regulation and response both to self and to tlie rest of the world.<br>
Suitably, the immune modulator composition or a pharmaceutical composition may also be used for the treatment or prevention of an adverse reaction to childhood vaccines - such as whooping cough vaccinations and the current MMR vaccinations -and/or consequences thereof<br>
(b) Immune system imbalance in the elderly	-  .<br>
An immune system imbalance - such as an upregulation, downregulation or inappropriately regulated cellular immune response, in particular downregulation, for example a deterioration of immvme function - may occur in older people, generally in<br><br>
excess of 60 years. In elderly people, a downregulation in the cellular immune response is generally referred to as immunosenescence. Typically, the deterioration of immune ftinction may lead to increased susceptibility to infectious diseases and neoplasia for example. The number of old people as a proportion of the population is dramatically increasing and geriatric medicine is becoming an important aspect of clinical practice. It is not surprising therefore that research has focused on the mechanisms of immunosenescence and the links between tlie health of the inmiune system and longevity. Goronzy (2001), examined the var&gt;"ing efficacy of influenza vaccination in the elderly. In this study, only 17% of subjects showed a rise in titre to all 3 haemagglutinins (successful vaccination) 1 month following vaccination and that 46% showed no demonstrable response at all. It was proposed that responsiveness to influenza vaccination is a useful biological marker of immunosenescence. A number of researchers have studied various aspects of the immune function in the elderly. For example, Lio (2000) studied cytokine responses, Solana (2000) studied NK and NKt cells, and Ginaldi (1999) suggested that a Thl to Th2 cytokine production shift and an increased production of proinflammatory cytokines could explain many aspects of age-associated pathological events, such as atherosclerosis and osteoporosis. Accordingly, a non-pathological stimulation of the immune system which drives the cytokine response away firom the prouiflammatory Th2 towards Thl is required. Preferably, such an immune modulator reduces the mortality from acute infection, counters the onset and reduces the morbidity of age related autoimmune disease and possibly reduces the rate of neoplastic disease, all of which are associated with immunosenescence.<br>
Typically, an iirmiune modulator composition or a phamiaceutical composition according to this aspect of the present invention may be an immune enhancer.<br>
The potential role of probiotic commensal gut or dairy bacteria have been investigated in this area.    For example, milk products supplemented with    5x10^ or    5x10 Bifidobacterium lactis or Lactobacillus rhamiiosus per dose taken daily for 3 w^eeks has been reported to increase the numbers of peripheral blood NK, CD4 and CD25 cells and generally boost systemic cellular immunity in the elderly (Gill, (2001)).<br><br>
Currently a number of products containing high numbers of Lactobacilli and other intestinal commensal flora are being actively promoted as "lifestyle enhancers". A review by Sanders (2001), on the claimed probiotic effects of Lactobacillus acidophilus, available as a drug since 1950, suggests its effects require further validation and clarification of the mechanism of action. Whilst there is a beneficial effect from replacing the bowel flora after diarrhoeal disease and combating candidiasis following antibiotic therapy, immime stimulation appears unreliable and short lived. However, this work clearly identifies a role for a potent orally administered immune modulator, preferably killed so as to avoid the difficulties of maintaining live products.<br>
Oral vaccination is a long established successful mechanism for inducing local protective immunity against oral/faecal pathogens - such as polio. However, orally administered vaccines have also been shown to evoke systemic protective immune responses both cell mediated and humoral. Sharpe (2002), used an orally administered adenovirus construct containing measles virus antigen to induce systemic antibody and splenic lymphocyte responses to the measles antigen. Manube (2002) has developed a model to show that orally administered attenuated Mycobacterium microti provides a higher level of protection to an aerosol challenge with tuberculosis than traditional subcutaneously administered BCG.<br>
Kim (2001) showed that feeding with Japanese cedar pollen produced oral tolerance to specific allergy induced by subsequent injection of pollen in oil. This was associated with decreased specific immunoglobin levels and a significant reduction in interleuldn-4 production ie the TH2 response was down-regulated.<br>
Therefore, a systemic immune response may be both stimulated and modulated by admmistration - such as oral administration - of a suitable immune modulator.<br><br>
Suitably, in one aspect of the present invention it is emisaged that a whole cell of the bacterium according to the present invention, may be mcluded in food preparations and'or may be supplied as a type of "remedy", preferably orally.<br>
Eniiancing the immune system<br>
The compositions of the present invention may be used in the manufacture of a medicament for enhancing the immune system in an animal , preferably a mammal, more preferably Uvestock, wliich may result in for example, enhancement (e.g. promotion) of growth and/or an increase in the efficiency of feed utilisation and/or a generally increased well-being (i.e. the overall health of the subject is unproved) in the subject. The overall health of a subject can be determined by one or more of the following parameters for example: weight data (with weight gain being a positive determinant), alertness (with full alert being a positive determinant), movement (with energetic movement as opposed to lethargic movement being a positive determinant) and sickness (with reduced amount of sickness beiiig a positive determinant). Topically, the immune modulator composition or pharmaceutical composition according to this aspect of the present invention may be an immune enhancer.<br>
Advantageously, the immune modulator composition or pharmaceutical composition of the present invention may be used to replace antibiotics that are currently used to promote the growth of livestock.<br>
The term "livestock", as used herein refers to any farmed animal. Preferably, livestock is one or more of poultry (including chickens), pigs (including piglets), sheep (including lambs), cows or bulls (including calves). More preferably, livestock means pigs - including piglets.<br>
The present invention also contemplates the genera of the present invention being administered in combination with known probiotic bacteria, for modification of the cellular immune response.<br><br>
Commercially at present antibiotics are commonly used as dietary eoliancing feed additives (or growth promoters) and are incorporated into animal feed. However, the EU, is expected to introduce a complete ban on the non-clinical use of antibiotics in animal husbandry. Therefore, the market requires effective altematives.<br>
An advantage of the present invention is that it may be used (optionalh- together with good animal husbandry practises) as a replacement to dietary enhancing feed additive (or growtli promoters).<br>
The immune modulator compositions or pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may be administered as a food additive when used to enhance the inmiune system.<br>
Cancer<br>
Suitably, the compositions according to the present invention are used to modulate a cellular immune response to treat and'or prevent cancer. In particular it is envisaged that the compositions according to the present invention may be used to protect a subject against developing and/or the progression of a cancer. In particular, the subject with a modulated cellular inraiune response may be less susceptible to the development of cancer.<br>
In particular, during cancer growth an unregulated increase in Th2 is observed.<br>
Cancer is a disease that affects many people, with 65 per cent of cases occurring in those over 65. As the average life expectancy in the UK has almost doubled since the mid-nineteenth century, the population at risk of cancer has grown. Death rates from other causes of death, such as heart disease, have fallen in recent years while deaths from cancer have remained relatively stable. The result is that 1 in 3 people will be diagnosed with cancer during their lifetime and 1 in 4 people will die from cancer.<br><br>
Examples of cancer include bladder, brain tumor, breast cancer, cervical cancer, colon and rectal cancer, adenocarcinoma, endometrial cancer, esophageal cancer, kidney cancer, leukaemia, liver cancer, lung cancer, melanoma , myeloma, non-hodgkin's lymphoma, ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer, sarcoma, soft tissue and stomach cancer.<br>
In addition, persistent smoking of tobacco, and to a lesser, extent passive smoking, has been associated with carcinomas of the parts directly in contact with smoke, oropharynx, trachea, lungs, oesophagus and stomach. As well as these, distant tumours such as those of the kidney, bladder, pancreas, liver and myeloid leukaemia may be increase by smoking of tobacco, hi the present invention, it is envisaged that compositions according to the present invention could be administered to smokers of tobacco in an attempt to reduce the smokers' risk of developing carcinomas associated with tobacco smoking.<br>
Suitably, the cancer may be an adenocarcinoma or a melanoma.<br>
Suitably, the cancer may be virally related cancers such as cervical cancer for example. Without wishing to be bound by theory, in some instances it has been found that an infection caused by papilloma viruses, such as dysplasia of the uterine cervix, precedes carcinoma of the cervix. Thus, cervical cancer is herein considered a "virally related cancer". However, the term "virally related cancer" as used herein means any cancer which may be caused by or related with a viral infection.<br>
Post-operative recovery, stress and infection<br>
Following any major operation a number of situations potentially arise:-<br>
Stresses associated with a surgical operation include one or more of the following: apprehension before the operation, stress to the tissues due to the operative procedures, the pain usually accompanying recovery, worry about the significance of operative findings.<br><br>
These kinds of stress are associated with the deviation of T-cell function towards Th2. Immunosuppressive effects of premedication and anaesthetics, which may persist for days or weeks after the operation itself<br>
In addition, exposure of cut flesh to direct infection at the time of operation and of the wound to infection in the recovery room and wards prior to leaving hospital is also a problem.<br>
A combination of these factors exposes the patient to a series of potential bacterial infections, which:-<br>
Since the patient is hospitalised, include such notorious hospital-associated infections as those with methicillin-resistant-iS'toj^/zj'/ococaw aureus (MRSA). Operations on the bowel expose the patient to gram-negative infections due to exposure of cut tissues to bowel contents. Operations on the lower limbs are also subject to infections with normal members of the gut flora.<br>
Minor infections of the wound delay heahng and increase the chances of contracting more serious infections.<br>
To counteract these influences, immune regulation towards Thl and a down-regulation of Th2 a result of the application of the invention, should do one or more of the following: increase non-specific resistance to post-operative bacterial infections; aid in wound healing and/or reduce stress.<br>
T HELPER CELLS<br>
The term 'Thl' as used herein refers to a type 1 T-helper cell (Thl). The term may also be used herein to refer to the response mediated by or through such a cell type. Such a response may include one or more of the secretion of Interleukin-2 (IL-2), the secretion of Interferon-gamma (IFN-y), activation of macrophages,  activation of<br><br>
c&gt;totoxic T-cells, or any other Thl-associated event. Tlius, the term 'Thl' may include Thl cell(s) as well as the immune response(s) which such cell(s) produce.<br>
The term 'Th2' as used herein refers to a type 2 T-helper cell (Th2). The term may also be used herein to refer to the response mediated by or tlirough such a cell type. Such a response may include one or more of the secretion of Interleukin-4 (IL-4), the secretion of the splice variant interleukin IL-452, the secretion of Interleukin-5 (IL-5), increase in levels of cell determinant 30 (CD30) on lymphocytes, increase in levels of Immunoglobulin-E (IgE) in the blood or eosinophils in the blood, or any other Th2-associated event. Thus, the term 'Th2' may include Th2 cell(s) as well as the immune response(s) which such cell(s) produce.<br>
It is known that various conditions may result in or from an unregulated or inappropriately regulated cellular immune response, in particular in the activation and/or proliferation of Thl and/or Th2, which if left unregulated or inappropriately regulated has been found to result in one or more detrimental effects on the subject.<br>
In particular, such an unregulated or inappropriately regulated cellular immune response has been found to occur following vaccination, eg. following childhood vaccinations, and is thought to result in conditions such as the onset of allergies, i.e. allergic dermatitis and allergic asthma. By way of example, Lewis D Cwr Opin Immiowl 2002; 14: 644 report that Th2 immune responses mediated by the secretion of IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13 are key in the pathogenesis of atopic disorders, including allergen-induced asthma, rhinoconjunctivitis and anaphylaxis. Although such responses are downregulated to some degree by conventional specific immunotherapy, this approach is only partially effective and has a substantial risk of adverse effects. Many strategies for immunotherapeutic prophylaxis and for treatment of atopic diseases have been devised on the basis of mouse allergy models, including the downregulation of Th2 responses by the induction of regulatory T cell activity, Th2 to Thl immune deviation, Thl crossregulation of Th2 immune responses, anergy and immunosuppressive cytokines. Choi &amp; Koh^/z/z Allergy Asthma Immunol 2002; 88: 584-91 examined whether BCG vaccination of adult patients with astlima, a Th2-<br><br>
associated allergic disease, is clinically effective. It was shown that BCG vaccination improved lung fiinction and reduced medication use in adults with moderate-to-severe astlmia. This amelioration was accompanied by a suppressed Th2-type immune response, suggesting that BCG vaccination might be an effective therapeutic modality against asthma, von Etrtztn J Allergy Clin Immunol 2002; 109: 923-8 outlined the possibility that prolonged maternal stress associated with sustained excessive Cortisol secretion could affect tlie developing immune system - especially Thl/Th2 cell differentiation which may further increase the susceptibility to asthma and atopy in genetically predisposed individuals.<br>
[n addition, an unregulated or inappropriately regulated cellular mimune response has<br>
)een observed during disease progression.   In particular during cancer growth an<br>
mregulated increase in Th2 is observed.   By way of example, Maraveyas et al. Ann<br>
Oncol 1999; 10: 817-24 have studied the efficacy of SRL 172 vaccine in patients with<br>
;ancer ie. advanced stage IV (AJCC) malignant melanoma. Induction of intracellular<br>
;ytokines (IL-2 and INF-gariinia) in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLCs) from these<br>
)atients was assayed and correlated to clinical outcome. It was demonstrated that SRL<br>
.72 was effective in inducing intracellular IL-2 responses in a significant number of<br>
)atients with stage IV (AJCC) melanoma.   Stanford et al. International Journal of<br>
Pharmaceutical Medicine 1999; 13: 191-195 report that there is increasing evidence<br>
hat effective anti-tumour immune responses are likely to be mediated by type 1<br>
ytokines. Recent investigations indicate that heat-killed Mycobacterium vaccae, is a<br>
eliable Thl  adjuvant and preliminary clinical trials indicate beneficial effects in<br>
aelanoma, and cancer of the prostate and lung. More extensive controlled studies are<br>
urrently being conducted to confirm these findings.<br>
01 unregulated or inappropriately regulated cellular immune response has also been bserved during infection and particularly chronic infection, for example during regressive tuberculosis, lepromatous leprosy, visceral leishmaniasis and HIV ifection and during allergies. By way of example, Clerici &amp; Shearer GM Immimol bday 1993; 14: 107-11 propose that a Thl to Th2 switch is a critical step in the tiology of HIV infection. Clerici &amp; Shearer Immunol Lett 1996; 51: 69-73 show that<br><br>
iÂ±lV-specific cell mediated immunit\' may be the main correlater of protection against HIV infection and against the progression of HIV infection to AIDS. Abbot NC et al European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgeiy 2002 24:202-8 evaluated immunotherapy as a means of improving peripheral blood flow in clironic leprosy patients by administration of heat-killed Mycobacterium vaccae. It was shown that immunotherapy, given 18 months earlier, significantly improved blood flow and temperature sensation, in fully-treated, chronic, leprosy patients.<br>
Accordingly, an aim of the present invention is to promote and establish the regulation of a cellular immune response, including the regulation or modulation of Thl and/or Tli2, in such a way so as to overcome the negative effects of the unregulated or inappropriately regulated cellular immune response.<br>
Suitably, the use of an immune modulator composition and/or pharmaceutical composition according to the present invention modulates the Thl or Th2 response, i.e. a Thl or Tla2 response that results in, for example, tissue damage.<br>
Suitably, the use of an immune modulator composition and/or pharmaceutical :omposition according to the present invention may decrease the Thl response and decrease the Th2 response. By way of example, such an immime modulator and/or pharmaceutical composition maybe useful in the treatment of diabetes for example.<br>
Suitably, the use of an immune modulator composition and/or pharmaceutical :omposition according to the present invention may increase the Thl response without iffecting the Th2 response. By way of example, such an immune modulator and/or pharmaceutical composition may be useful as an immune enhancer.<br>
Suitably, the use of an immune modulator composition and/or pharmaceutical composition according to the present invention may increase the Thl response and lecrease the Th2 response. By way of example, such an immune modulator and/or )harmaceutical composition may be useful in the treatment of asthma.<br><br>
Suitably, a skilled person can test a specific species of each genus according to the present invention to determine its specific Thl/Th2 response.<br>
An unregulated or inappropriately regulated immune response may play a role in the establishment of disease due to the fact that some diseases cause shifted Thl and/or Tli2 responses. Accompanying these atypical Thl and Th2 reactions are a series of abnormal inflammatory responses, which may take part in the mechanisms underlying tissue pathology.<br>
By way of example only, the immune modulator composition and/or pharmaceutical<br>
composition according to the present invention may counteract the disadvantages of<br>
reduced contact with environmental influences (for example, antigens) coimnensurate<br>
with modem life, may counteract the influence of treatment of an infection (eg. a<br>
jarasitic infection, such as, for example, malaria, trypanosomiasis, leishmaniasis, and<br>
oxoplasmosis) and/or the immimological abnormalities accompanying an infection,<br>
;tress, such as, for example, major trauma stress, psychosocial stress and chronic<br>
;tress, an allergy (eg. asthma including asthma, allergic asthma , hayfever, allergic<br>
iermatitis (eczema), anaphylactic shock, allergies to plant contact or ingestion, stings<br>
- such as nettle and insect stings, and allergies to insect bites - such as midges for<br>
nstance Ciilicoides (which causes Sweet Itch in horses), heaves, COPD and cancer<br>
for example melanoma or adenocarcuioma); an immune system imbalance (eg. an<br>
mmune system imbalance in children eg. the undesirable effect of childhood vaccines<br>
nd the elderly); and post-operative stess and post-operative infection.<br>
VACCINES<br>
he preparation of vaccines which contain one or more substances as an active igredient(s), is known to one skilled in the art. Typically, such vaccines are prepared ; injectables, either as liquid solutions or suspensions; solid forms suitable for )lution in, or suspension in, liquid prior to injection may also be prepared.

jjuiiuimccuucaiiy acceptable arid compatible with the active ingredient. Suitable excipients are, for example, water, saline, dextrose, glycerol, ethanol, or the like and combinations thereof Alternatively, the vaccine may be prepared, for example, to be orally ingested and/or capable of iohalation.<br>
In addition, if desired, the vaccine may contain minor amounts of auxiliary substances such as wetting or emulsifying agents and pH buffering agents.<br>
ADMINISTRATION<br>
Typically, a physician will determine the actual dosage of a vaccine, immune modulator composition and pharmaceutical composition which will be most suitable for an individual subject and it will vary with the age, weight and response of the particular patient. The dosages below are exemplary of the average case. There can, of course, be uidividual instances where higher or lower dosage ranges are merited.<br>
Preferably, the actual dosage that is used results in minimal toxicity to the subject.<br>
The compositions of the present invention may be administered by direct injection. The composition may be formulated for parenteral, mucosal, intramuscular, intravenous, subcutaneous, intraocular, intradermal or transdermal administration.<br>
Suitably, the composition according to the present invention may be administered at a dose of 10^ - 10^^ organisms, preferably 10"^ - 10'Â° organisms, more preferably 10^ -10 - 5x10^ organisms, and even more preferably 10^ - 10^ organisms. Typically, the composition according to the present invention may be administered at a dose of 10 -10^ bacteria for human and animal use.<br>

As will be readily appreciated by a skilled person the dosage administered wiU be dependent upon tlie organism to wliich the dose is being administered.<br>
The term "administered" includes delivery by delivery mechanisms including injection, lipid mediated transfection, liposomes, unmunoliposomes, lipofectin, cationic facial ampliipliiles (CFAs) and combnaations thereof, or even viral delivery. The routes for such delivery mechanisms include but are not lunited to mucosal, nasal, oral, parenteral, gastrointestinal, topical, or sublingual routes.<br>
The term "administered" includes but is not limited to delivery by a mucosal route, for example, as a nasal spray or aerosol for inhalation or as an ingestable solution; a parenteral route where delivery is by an injectable form, such as, for example, an intravenous, intramuscular, intradermal or subcutaneous route.<br>
The term "co-administered" means that the site and time of administration of each of the adjuvants(s), antigen(s) and/or antigenic determinant(s) of the present invention are such that the necessary modulation of the immune system is achieved. Thus, whilst the antigen(s) and adjuvant(s) may be administered at the same moment in time and at the same site, there may be advantages in administering the antigen(s) and/or antigenic detenninant(s) at a different time and to a different site from the adjuvant(s). The antigen(s) and/or antigenic determinant(s) and adjuvant(s) may even be delivered in the same delivery vehicle - and the antigen(s) and/or antigenic determinant(s) and adjuvant(s) may be coupled and^or uncoupled and/or genetically coupled and/or uncoupled. By way of example only, the inmiune modulator composition according to the present invention may be administered before, at the same time or post administration of one or more antigens or further antigens.<br><br>
The antigen, antigenic deteraiinant, peptide or homologue or mimetic thereof may be administered separately or co-administered to the host subject as a single dose or in multiple doses.<br>
The immune modulator composition and/or pharmaceutical composition of the invention may be administered by a number of different routes such as injection (which includes parenteral, subcutaneous, intradermal and intramuscular injection) intranasal, mucosal, oral, intra-vaginal, urethral or ocular administration.<br>
Preferably, in the present invention, administration is by injection. More preferably the injection is intradermal.<br>
Preferably, in the present invention, administration is by an orally acceptable composition.<br>
For vaccination the- composition can be provided in 0.1 to 0.2 ml of aqueous solution, preferably buffered physiological saline, and administered parenterally, for example by intradermal inoculation. The vaccine according to the invention is preferably injected intradermally. Slight swelling and redness, sometimes also itching may be found at the injection site. The mode of administration, the dose and the number of administrations can be optimised by those skilled in the art in a known manner.<br>
ANTIGENS<br>
As used herein, an "antigen" means an entity which, when introduced into an immunocompetent host, modifies the production of a specific antibody or antibodies that can combine with the entity, and/'or modifies the relevant Th response, such as Th2 and/or Thl. The antigen may be a pure substance, a mixture of substances or soluble or particulate material (including cells or cell fragments or cell sonicate). In this sense, the term includes any suitable antigenic determinant, cross reacting antigen, alloantigen, xenoantigen, tolerogen, allergen, hapten, and immunogen, or parts thereof.<br><br>
as well as any combination thereof, and these terms are used interchangeably throughout the text.<br>
The term "antigenic determinant or epitope" as used herein refers to a site on an antigen which is recognised by an antibody or T-cell receptor, or is responsible for evoking the T-helper cell response. Preferably it is a short peptide derived from or as part of a protein antigen. However the term is also intended to include glycopeptides and carbohydrate epitopes. The term also includes modified sequences of amino acids or carbohydrates which stimulate responses which recognise the whole organism.<br>
It is advantageous if the antigenic determinant is an antigenic determinant of the infectious agent which causes the infectious disease.<br>
A "preventative" or "prophylactic" vaccme is a vaccine which is admmistered to naive individuals to prevent development of a condition, such as by stimulating protective immunity.<br>
A "therapeutic" vaccine is a vaccine which is administered to individuals with an existing condition to reduce or minimise the condition or to abrogate the immunopathological consequences of the condition.<br>
ADJUVANTS<br>
The term 'adjuvant' as used herein means an entity capable of augmenting or participating in the influencing of an inmiune response. An adjuvant is any substance or mixture of substances that assists, increases, downregulates, modifies or diversifies the immune response to an antigen..<br>
The immune modulator composition and/or pharmaceutical composition according to the present invention may comprise one or more adjuvants which enhance the effectiveness of the immune modulator composition and/or pharmaceutical compositions.  Examples of additional adjuvants which, may be effective include but<br><br>
are not limited to: aluminium hydroxide, aluminium phosphate, aluminium potassium sulphate (alum), beryllium sulphate, silica, kaolin, carbon, water-in-oil emulsions, oil-in-water emulsions, muramyl dipeptide, bacterial endotoxin, lipid X, Coiynebacterium paTvum {Propionobacteriwn acnes), Bordetella pertussis. Mycobacterium vaccae, polyribonucleotides, sodiuni alginate, lanolin, lysolecithin. vitamin A, interleukins such as interlfeukin 2 and interleukin-12, saponin, liposomes, levamisole, DEAE-dextran, blocked copolymers or other synthetic adjuvants. Such adjuvants are available commercially from various sources, for example, Merck Adjuvant 65 (Merck and Company, Inc., Rahway, K.J.) or Freund's Incomplete Adjuvant and Complete Adjuvant (Difco Laboratories, Detroit, Michigan). Only alummium hydroxide is approved for hxmian use. Some of the other adjuvants, such as Ad. vaccae for example, have been approved for clinical trials.<br>
Suitably, the adjuvant may be a whole cell of a bacterium from any one of the genera Rhodococcus, Gordonia, Nocardia, Dietzia, TsiikamureUa and Nocardioides.<br>
In the art, it is known that DNA vaccines, wliich are essentially DNA sequences attached to gold particles and which are fired into the skin by a helium gun, are efficient vaccine delivery systems. Unlike conventional vaccines, these DNA vaccines do not require a traditional adjuvant component. In accordance with a further aspect of the present invention, the inunune modulator composition as defined herein may suitably be used in conjunction with such DNA vaccines to augment or participate in the influencing of the immune response.<br>
PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONS<br>
The present invention also provides a phannaceutical composition comprising a therapeutically effective amount of a whole cell of a bacterium from the genera Rhodococcus, Gordonia, Nocardia, Dietzia, Tsukamurella and Nocardioides and optionally a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, diluent or excipients (including combinations thereof).<br><br>
The pharmaceutical composition may comprise two components - a first component comprising an antigen and a second component comprising an adjuvant tliereof. The first and second component may be delivered sequentially, simultaneously or together, and even by different administration routes.<br>
Suitably, the antigen may even be engendered within the host tissues as part of a disease process. Thus, antigen may originate from a bacterial, host or parasitic invasion, or may be a substance release from the tissues such as a stress protein or a<br>
tumour antigen.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions may be for human or animal usage in human and veterinary medicine and v^ill typically comprise any one or more of a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent, carrier, or excipient. Acceptable carriers or diluents for therapeutic use are well known in the pharmaceutical art, and are described, for example, in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mack Publishing Co. (A. R. Geimaro edit. 1985). The choice of pharaiaceutical carrier, excipient or diluent can be selected with regard to the intended route of adminisfration and standard pharmaceutical practice. The pharmaceutical compositions may comprise as - or in addition to - the carrier, excipient or diluent any suitable binder(s), lubricant(s), suspending agent(s), coating agent(s), solubilising agent(s).<br>
Preservatives, stabilisers, dyes and even flavouring agents may be provided in the pharmaceutical composition. Examples of preservatives include sodium benzoate, sorbic acid and esters of p-hydi'oxybenzoic acid. Antioxidants and suspending agents may be also used.<br>
There may be different composition/formulation requirements dependent on the different delivery systems. By way of example, the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention may be formulated to be delivered using a mini-pump or by a mucosal route, for example, as a nasal spray or aerosol for inhalation or ingestable solution, or parenterally in which the composition is formulated by an injectable form, for  delivery,  by,   for   example,   an  intravenous,   intramuscular,   intradeniial   or<br><br>
subcutaneous route. Alternatively., the formulation may be designed to be delivered by both routes.<br>
Preferably in the present uiveution the formulation is of injectable form. More preferably the formulation is intradermally injected.<br>
Preferably in the present invention the formulation is an orally acceptable composition.<br>
WTiere the agent is to be delivered mucosally tlirough the gastrointestinal mucosa, it should be able to remain stable during transit through the gastrointestinal tract; for example, it should be resistant to proteolytic degradation, stable at acid pH and resistant to the detergent effects of bile.<br>
WTiere appropriate, the pharmaceutical compositions can be administered by inhalation, in the form of a suppository or pessary, topically in the form of a lotion, solution, cream, ointment or dusting powder, by use of a skin patch, orally in the form of tablets containing excipients such as starch or lactose, or in capsules or ovules either alone or in admixture with excipients, or in the form of elixirs, solutions or suspensions containing flavouring or colouring agents, or they can be injected parenterally, for example intravenously, uitramuscularly, intradermally or subcutaneously. For parenteral administration, the compositions may be best used in the form of a sterile aqueous solution which may contain other substances, for example ;nough salts or monosaccharides to make the solution isotonic with blood. For buccal Dr sublingual administration the compositions may be administered in the form of :ablets or lozenges which can be fomiulated in a conventional manner.<br>
PHARMACEUTICAL COMBINATIONS<br>
The agent of the present invention may be administered with one or more other 5harmaceutically active substances. By way of example, the present invention covers he simultaneous, or sequential treatments with an immune modulator composition md/or pharmaceutical composition according to the present invention, and one or<br><br>
more steroids, analgesics, antivirals, interleukins such as IL-2, or other pharmaceutically active substance(s).<br>
It will be understood that these regimes include the administration of the substances sequentially, simultaneously or together.<br>
IMMUNE ENHANCER<br>
The term "immune enhancer" as used herein means one or more bacteria either isolated or in culture which when administered to a subject benefit the health of that subject. Preferably, this benefit is achieved by the modification of the cellular inunune response of the subject.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, immune enliancers may be used, for example, for the treatment or prevention of an immune system imbalance in a subject, preferably a child or an elderly subject, or for enliancing the immune system of a subject, for example of a mammal, particularly of livestock or of himians.<br>
The immime enhancers may be administered by consumption in specially designed food or in animal feeds, for example pig animal feeds supplemented with the bacteria of the present invention.<br>
The immune enhancers may also be administered by other routes - such as direct injection.<br>
Preferably, the bacteria are killed so as to avoid the difficulties of maintaining live products.<br><br>
IDENTIFYING A BACTERIUM THAT MODULATES A CELLULAR IMMUNE RESPONSE<br>
In another aspect, the present invention relates to a method for identif}'ing one or more \\hole cells of bacteria from the genera Rhodococcus, Gordonia, Nocardia, Dietzia, Tsukamurella and Nocardioides that modulate (e.g. modify) a cellular immune response comprising the steps of: (a) contacting a fost test animal with an immunostimulant; (b) contacting a second test animal with an immunostimulant mixed ^^"ith a bacterium; (c) measuring the cellular immune response in each of the test animals; and (d) comparing the cellular immune response in each of the test animals, \^â– herein, a lower cellular immune response from the immunostimulant mixed with a bacterium in comparison to the immunostimulant alone is indicative of a modification of the cellular immune response by the bacterium.<br>
In another aspect, the present invention relates to a method of determining the Thl/Th2 response of a species of bacteria selected from the genera Rhodococcus. Gordonia, Nocardia, Dietzia, Tsukamurella and Nocardioides which method comprises utilisation of the tuberculin skin test. In mice, the tuberculin skin test is preferably carried out on the foot pad. In a predominant Thl reaction the positive foot pad immune response is maximal at 24 hours and diminishes at 48 hours. However, as tlie Tli2 reactivity increases then the 48 hour positive foot pad immune response increases and can even exceed the foot pad immune response at 24 hour.<br>
The effect of BCG vaccination is well documented using this tuberculin skin test. Thus, the test assay can be used to assess whether or not the introduction of an immune modulator composition according to the present invention modulates the BCG cellular immune response.<br>
As used herein, the term "test animal" refers to any animal that elicits a cellular immune response to the immunostimulant. Preferably, the test animal(s) is a mammal. More preferably, the test animal(s) is a rat, hamster, rabbit, guinea pig or mouse. More preferably, the test animal(s) is a mouse.<br><br>
Preferably, the bacterium modifies the T helper cell response. Suitably, the bacterium may modiiy the T helper cell response by decreasing the Thl and Th2 response, suitably, the bacterium may modify the T helper cell response by increasing the Thl â– esponse and decreasing the Th2 response. Suitably, the bacterium may modify the T lelper cell response by increasing the Thl response without affecting the Th2 esponse.<br>
'referably, the immunostimulant will have a known Thl and Th2 response. For xample, with the immunostimulant BCG the reaction is usually largest at 24h when it 5 an indicator of the Thl response; the reaction at 48h is usually less and includes a 'h2 contribution. It is known that BCG predominantly stimulates a Thl response. ly use of such immunostimulants it may be possible to determine the Thl/Th2 esponse of a test bacterium and, thus, it may be possible to identify one or more acteria which have a desired Thl/Th2 response to treat and/or prevent a particular Lsease and/or disorder.<br>
â– eferably, the cellular immune response is measured using the tuberculin skin test, accination with an immunostimulant - such as BCG - induces a response to skin-sting with tuberculin (a soluble preparation of Tubercle bacilli), when tested later, le local reaction is measured at various intervals, for example, 24 hours, 48 hours d 72 hours after injection of tuberculin.  Briefly, an immunostimulant (eg. BCG) is ed that induces a positive immune response to tuberculin.   In the test animal, the Derculin skin test is preferably carried out on the foot pad.  In a predominant Thl iction the positive foot pad immune response is usually maximal at 24 hours and ninishes at 48 hours.   However, as the Tli2 reactivity increases then the 48 hour sitive foot pad immune response increases and can even exceed the foot pad mune response at 24 hour. Thus, the assay can be used to assess whether or not the roduction of an immune modulator composition according to the present invention idulates the cellular immune response.<br>
ferably, the immunostimulant is BCG.<br><br>

EXAMPLES<br>
METHODS<br>
Tuberculin skin test<br>
The tuberculin skin test is an appropriate model assay to assess the effect of an immune modulator composition, i.e. bacterial compositions/suspensions comprising whole killea bacterial cells according to the present invention, on a cellular immune response.<br>
BCG vaccination induces a positive immune response to tuberculin. In mice, the tuberculin skin test is preferably carried out on the foot pad. In a predominant Thl reaction the positive foot pad immune response is maximal at 24 hours and diminishes at 48 hours. However, as the Th2 reactivity increases then the 48 hour positive foot pad immune response increases and can even exceed the foot pad immune response at 24 hour.<br><br>
The effect of BCG vaccination is well documented using this tuberculin skin test. Thus the test assay can be used to assess whether or not the introduction of an immum modulator composition according to the present invention modulates the BCG cellula immune response.<br>
Preparation of abacterial suspension<br>
The bacterial species from the genera Rhodococciis, Gordonia, Nocardia, Dietzia Tsukamurella and Nocardioides may be grown in an antigen-free medium, such ai Sauton's medium, in a fermenter for 2-28 days. Alternatively, the bacterial species o interest may be grown on a solid slope. Alternative methods would be readily available tc those skilled in the art.<br>
The resulting bacterial mass may be harvested and either used directly or after washing tc make a suspension in buffer. The bacterial cell suspension is prepared to contain betweer 100,000 and 10,000,000,000 bacilli per dose. The bacterial cells are resuspended in watei or in a saline. Preferably, the saline is buffered at pH 8.0 with borate. Preferably the bacilli are inactivated (killed), suitably by heating in an autoclave for 15 minutes a<br>
121Â°C. The resulting bacterial suspension comprises whole cells.<br>
EXAMPLE 1: Modulation of a cellular immune response by Rhodococcus ruber (R.r.).<br>
Group 1:	young adult female outbred mice were left unvaccinated as a control<br>
group.<br>
Group 2:	young adult female outbred mice were vaccinated on day 0 into the scrufi<br>
of the neck with BCG (10^ bacilli) (Evans).<br>
Group 3:	young adult female outbred mice were vaccinated on day 0 mto the scrufj<br>
of the neck with BGC (10^ bacilli) to which heat-killed Mycobacterium vaccae (A4.v.) (10'<br>
bacilli) had been added.<br><br>
All mice in Groups 1-3 were foot pad tested for tuberculin immune response at days 1( and 30. Then each mouse was injected with heat-killed Mycobacterium vaccae (10 bacilli) at day 40. At day 50 the tuberculin test on the foot pad was repeated.<br>
Group 4:	young adult female outbred mice were left uiivaccinated as a iurther contro<br>

In the control Group 1 Mycobacterium vaccae treatment induced a statistically significan increase in the immune response to tuberculin after both 24 hours (p
In the BCG groups (Group 2 and Group 5), the fall in response to tuberculin between 24 hours and 48 hours was greater (p=0.06) in the mice receiving treatment with Rhodococcus ruber (the mean fall being 28.2+15.7) than in the mice receiving treatment with. Mycobacterium vaccae (the mean fall being 14.9Â±9.6).<br>

 <br>
receiving treatment with Rhodococcus ruber (mean fall being 41.0Â±41.0) than in mic receiving treatment with Mycobacterium vaccae (mean fall being 12.7Â±7.0).<br>
These data suggest that there is a down-regulation of the Th2 response after treatment wit Rhodococcus ruber, which is not seen following treatment with Mycobacterium vaccae.<br>
In the BCG + R.r. groups (Groups 7 and 8) the effect of adding R.r. lO" (Group 7) or IC (Group 8) to BCG was very similar and after the second injection with R.r. there was substantial reduction in response between 24 and 48 hours (15.5+10.0).<br>
EXAMPLE 2: Modulation of a cellular immune response using Nocardia asteroide (N.a.), Gordonia bronchialis (G.b.) or Tsukamurella inchonensis {T.p.).<br>
This experiment was designed to compare the effects of foot-pad testing with Tuberculi;<br>
28 days after vaccinating groups of 6 mice with BCG alone or with the addition of 10 M.V., R.r., Nocardia asteroides (N.a.), Gordonia bronchialis (G.b.) or Tsukamurell inchonensis (T.p.). To find out what the effects were on the immune response to each o these added organisms, the groups of animals were tested in the other foot-pad 28 day after they had been tested with Tuberculin with skin-test reagents made firom the organisn included in their vaccination (Vaccin, Rubin, Asterin, Bronchialin and Inchonensin).<br>

All of the bacterial suspensions depressed the 28 day Tuberculin response measured at both 24 and 48 hours, in comparison with that following BCG alone (p=0.05; p=0.2).<br>
With the exception of Tuberculin and Vaccui, tliis was the first time that any of these skin test reagents have been used. The differences in responsiveness to the new reagents at 24 hours were probably because they had not been equilibrated except by protein estimation. However, all showed a fall in response between 24 and 48 hours at day 50, suggesting immunoregulatory activity.<br>
EXAMPLE 3: Modulation of a cellular immune response by Rhodococcus ruber treatment<br>
This experiment was designed to investigate the effect of Diphtheria/Tetanus/Pertussis (DTP) vaccine and/or Measles/Mumps/Rubella (MMR) vaccine on subsequent BCG vaccination and how the effect can be modified by treatment with heat killed whole cells of Rlrodococcus mber given 7 days or 28 days in advance, or witli the fu:st dose of DTP.<br>
The experimental design is detailed in Table 4. Groups of six weaning female outbred mice received the treatments detailed in Table 4. All mice were tuberculin-tested 28 days after BCG vaccination.<br>
The results are presented in Table 3.<br><br>

Trends shown in this experiment:<br>
The effect of giving DTP/MMR before BCG (Groups 3 &amp; 4 in Table 4): the administration of DTP and MMR before vaccination with BCG results in an increase in the 24 hour response and better separation betu^een the 24 and 48 hour responses.<br>
The effect of giving i?./-. before BCG (Group 6 in Table 4): R.r. given 49 days before BCG increases the Tuberculin response at 24 and 48 hours, and increases the difference between them.<br>
The effect of giving R.r. before DTP/MMR before BCG (Groups 1 &amp; 2 in Table 4): giving Rr. 28 days before DTP/MMR increases the separation between the 24 and 48 hour Tuberculin responses, whereas giving R.r. 7 days before DTP/MMR suppresses the effect on subsequent BCG.<br>
The effect of giving R.r. with the first dose of DTP/MMR before BCG (Group 7 in Table 4): giving Rr. with the first injection of DTP appeared to make no difference to the effect of DTP/MMR on subsequent BCG vaccination.<br>
Preliminary findings suggest that immunisation with DTP followed by MMR, prior to BCG vaccination, has an effect on Tuberculin reactivity 28 days later. The study also suggests that vaccination with R.r. prior to BCG vaccination, has an effect on Tuberculin reactivity 28 days later. The timing of vaccination with R.?: in relation to DTP/MMR prior to BCG vaccination may be important.<br>

This data, demonstrates a significant reduction of parasites circulating in the blood at the time when the greatest numbers are found in the control animals. This suggests that both R. ruber and R. coprophilus enhance the Thl responses (7 days is too early for antibody production via the Th2 route).<br>
EXAMPLE 7: Investigating the effects of Rhodococcus coprophilus NCIMB 11211, Gordonia bronchialis NC10667 and Tsukamurella inchonensis NC13040 on toxicity, in particular growth rate and subsequent BCG vaccination in newborn mice.<br>
An alternative test of toxicity is that in which subcutaneous injections of Gordonia bronchialis, Rhodococcus coprophylus or Tsukamurella inchonensis are given on the<br><br>
day of birth, and again in a separate site, on day 21. These animals, and saline-injected controls were weighed at regular inter\'als over 3 months.<br>
Methods<br>
9 late tenn pregnant Balb C mice are used.<br>
Preparation of killed bacterial suspension: Suspension prepared from 10 day Sauton antifoam broth culture, centrifuged and resuspended as a 10 mgs/ml in borate buffered saline, autoclaved and stored at 4Â°C. Dilute 10 mgs ml, 10'Â° /ml 1/2 in borate giving 5x10^ and then diluting 1/10 in borate buffer giving a final concentration oflO' in20|ifor use.<br>
Dayl<br>

Inject control litters with 20}j,litres of M15 borate buffered sahne into the scruff.<br>
Litter 1 = 2 female + 3 male {Rhodococcus coprophihis NCIMB 11211)<br>

Wean the mice, sex and separate the litters into 2 groups male and female<br>
Weigh and revaccinate. Mark individuals by tail marking with an indelible pen.<br>
Weigh and re tail mark weekly for 3 montlis.<br>
Figure 1 demonstrates the results of weight gain means/litter females test and controls over 12 weeks from weaning.<br>
Figure 2 demonstrates the results of weight gain mean/litter males test and controls over 12 weeks from weaning.<br>
Weight gain is the same in all groups, and only 2/57 animals died over tlie 3 months. Both were males, that died just after being put together with other males after weaning. Thus it can be concluded that weight gain and progress of the animals was unaffected by the three species tested.<br>
EXAMPLE 8: The effect on BCG immunisation measured through the tuberculin skin test response<br>
An immune modulator test model is devised, based upon the principle that vaccination with BCG induces a response to skin-testing with Tuberculin (a soluble preparation of Tubercle bacilli), when tested 4 weeks later. The local reaction is measured 24 hours, 48 hours and 72 hours after injection of Tuberculin. In the mouse the reaction is<br><br>
usually largest at 24 hours when it is an indicator of the Thl response to the antigens in Tuberculin. The reaction at 48 hours is usually less and includes a Th2 contribution. The reaction at 72 hours is often little less than at 48 hours and is a Th2 response. This post-BCG Tuberculin reaction can be modulated by prior priming, so that the Thl and Till components of the reaction will reflect the nature of the priming reagent.<br>
Methods<br>
Mice primed according to Example 8 when 3 months old were injected with 10^ BCG in lOOul into the scruff to half of each test and the control group.<br>
At 4 months tuberculin test with reagent T1475 Img/ml. Dilute lOOjihtres in 1.9 ml to give final concentration of 50p.gms/ml. Store at 4 Â°C. Dose is 2.5|i.g in 50|J,litres given into the_hind footpad. Tuberculin response swelling as measured using a micrometer at 24, 48 and 72 hours.<br>

Conclusion<br>
The species tested each induced different effects on the tuberculin test following BCG challenge:<br>
Rhodococcus rhodocroiis induced an enhanced Thl response, without changing the Th2 response. It has also been shown that Rhodococcus rhodnii, Dietzia maris and Gordonia terrae also have this function. Rhodococcus ruber also has this function.<br>
Tsukamurella inchonensis enhanced or left unchanged the Thl response and down-regulated the Th2 response. It has also been shown that Gordonia bronchialis, Gordonia amarae and Nocardia asteroids also have this function.<br>
Rhodococcus coprophilus strongly down-regulated both Thl and Th2 responses.<br>
These results also clearly show that the influence of 2 priming immunisations with any of the representative species of the invention persists for at least 9 weeks after the second immunisation.<br>
EXAMPLE 9: Immune modulator test model<br><br>
vaccination with BCG induces a response to skin-testing with Tuberculin (a soluble preparation of Tubercle bacilli), when tested 4 weeks later. The local reaction is measured 24 hours, 48 hours and 72 hours after injection of Tuberculin. The reaction is usually largest at 24 hours when it is an indicator of the Thl response to the antigens in Tuberculin. The reaction at 48 hours is usually less and includes a Th2 contribution. The reaction at 72 hours is often little less than at 48 hours and is a Tli2 response. This post-BCG Tuberculm reaction can be modulated by prior priming, so that the Thl and Th2 components of the reaction will reflect the nature of the priming reagent.<br>
The known immunostimulant, BCG is injected into the scruff of young 3 week old mice and the tuberculin response measured 1 month later by subcutaneous injection of tuberculin into the mouse footpad. The resultant swelling ie. the "tuberculin response" is then measured at 24, 48 and 72 hours. Swelling at 24 hours is considered an early Dr Thl mediated response and swelling at 48 and 72 hours a late or Th2 mediated â– esponse. BCG in the healthy mouse stimulates predominantly a Thl response.<br>

Results<br>
Figure 7 is a graph demonstrating the immune modulation of the BCG effect by three species  of bacteria.     Tuberculin responses  are  measured  at  24  and 48  hours.<br><br>
Representative species are (Na) Nocardia asteroids; (Gb) Gordonia bronchialis; and (Tp) Tsiikamurella inchonensis.<br>
Figure 8 is a graph demonstrating the immune modulation of BCG/BCG+ by two species of bacteria. Tuberculin responses are measured at 24, 48 and 72 hours. Representative species are (Rrh) Rhodococcus rhodocrous and (Dm) Dietzia maris.<br>
Figure 9 is a graph demonstrating the immune modulation of the BCG effect by selected species within the genus Rhodococcus. Tuberculin responses are measured at 24, 4S and 72 hours. (Rrh) Rhodococcus rhodocrous; (Rru) Rhodococcus ruber; (Rrhod) Rhodococcus rhodnii; (Rcop) Rhodococcus coprophihis; (Ropa) Rhodococcus opacus; (Reryth) Rhodococcus eiythopolis.<br>
Figure 10 is a graph demonstrating the optimal dose for Rhodococcus niber using BCG modified with log dilutions of Rhodococcus niter from 10 to 10 compared to BCG alone.<br>
Conclusion<br>
This screening test demonstrates that by mixing test suspensions with BCG and comparing to BCG alone, 28 days later the tuberculin test, as a measure of response to BCG, has been regulated or modified. In this simple model, immunoregulation is shown as a depression m the size of the response at both 24 and 48 hours. This can be further investigated in longer term experiments in which priming with the test suspension is carried out some weeks before challenge with BCG and subsequent Tuberculin testing.<br>

This is based on the principle that an immune system primed for Thl enliancement, with or without regulation of Th2 results in less restriction of growth by subclinical infections. Thus in a situation where minor infections are frequent, a reduction of their<br><br>
influence should result in tlie animals putting on more weight. This might be achieved by reducing the level of circulating TNF (Tumour Necrosis Factor), wliich in the presence of Th2 cytokines acts as "cachectic factor", reducing appetite and increasmg the metabolic rate.<br>
The study was carried out in 10 newborn piglets. These animals were kept with all the others bom that week.<br>
On the day of birth: all piglets received intradermal injections of 0.1ml over the left side of the neck. They were then weighted and returned to the sow. The control group (5 piglets) received injections of borate buffered (pH 8) saline as placebo. The test group (5 piglets) received 500 micrograms Rhodococcus coprophilus in 0.1 ml borate buffered (pH 8) saline.<br>
On day 7: all piglets received intradermal injections of 0.1ml over the right side of the neck. They were then weighed and returned to the sow. The control group received injections of borate buffered (pH 8) saline as placebo. The test group received 500 micrograms Rhodococcus coprophilus in 0.1 ml borate buffered (pH 8) saline<br>
On day 14: all piglets received intradermal injections of 0.1ml over the right side of the neck. They were then weighed and returned to the sow. The control group received injections of borate buffered (pH 8) saline as placebo. The test group received 2 mg Rhodococcus coprophilus in 0.2 ml borate buffered (pH 8) saline<br><br>
The data is presented hereinbelow:<br><br>

hi Figure 11a graph is shown which demonstrates the growth enhancement of pigs administered with Rhodococcus coprophilns (Ro) as test reagent.<br>
Preliminary investigations show that piglets receiving Rhodococcus coprophilus put on significantly more weight than placebo controls given similar injections, but of buffered saline. The advantages of this may be that the pigs would reach regular slaughter weight (between 90-100kg) 2 to 3 weeks earlier than usual.<br>
Without wishing to be bound by theory it is sunnised that the increased weight gain seen in animals receiving the test reagent may be due to one or more of the following: better food conversion, a reduction m infection and reduced stress.<br>
EXAMPLE 11: Modulation of Stress associated Avith Sweet Itch in horses<br>
Sweet-itch is the skin condition commonly troubling horses and ponies making " allergic response to bites by Culicoides midges. This most commonly occurs in areas where hair is long, such as the mane and tail. There is a loss of hair and thickening and inflammation of the skin with intense itching. Horses are excited and distressed by this condition and may lose weight as a result thereof. This is an annual condition affecting afflicted horses and ponies in the late spring and summer usually.<br>
Groups of 4 ponies and horses known to develop sweet-itch every year, received T. inchonensis Img by intradermal injection on 2 occasions 2-weeks apart, 4 animals received injections of buffered saline as a control, and 2 animals received Img<br><br>
injections of M. vaccae as a positive control. Since this was being done during the sweet-itch season, animals wore a blanket, hood or mask to protect them from midge bites, which will be removed 3-weeks after the second injection. Following removal of the coats, sweet-itch is expected to occur within 1-2 weeks in the control group when ' the first full assessment of efficacy will be made. A third injection of the reagents may be given at that time.<br>

EXAMPLE 12: Prevention of Sweet Itch in horses<br><br>
A 7-year old horse known to regularly develop quite severe sweet-itch every year in the midge season, was given two intradermal injections of T. inchonensis in the front of the chest in January and February rspecti\ely with two weeks between the injections. Until the last few days of May and well into the Culicoides season the. horse surprisingly showed no signs of sweet-itch, such as hair loss or skin inflammation. At the end of May sweet-itch did appear in the animal and a third injection of T. inchonensis was administered to the animal. Within 24-48 hours of administration the sweet itch symptoms (in particular skin inflammation and/or hair loss) had completely disappeared. The animal was then again sweet-itch free until early August. Again a fiirther (4') injection of T. inchonensis was administered and again the sweetitch symptoms disappeared within 24-48hr3 post administration.<br>
This data is presented in graphical form in Figure 21.<br>
The results show that T. inchonensis administered twice prior to the sweet itch season and then again on an ad hoc basis during the sweet-itch season as and when the s}Tnptoms of sweetitch occur will provide an effective prevention and/or freatment against sweet itch.<br>
EXAMPLE 13: Cancer model<br>
This study assesses the effect of injections of 10^ and lO' Gordonia bronchialis, Rhodococciis coprophihis and Tsukamurella inchonensis in the prevention and treatment of mice challenged with a lung adenocarcinoma cell line. Groups of mice will receive subcutaneous injections of the test species or saline placebo into the scruff of the neck 5 weeks and two weeks before subcutaneous challenge with tumour cells into the side. The third injection of the test organisms and saline placebo will be given into the scruff of the neck 1 week after tumour challenge. The number of tumour cells injected will be decided by those ftilly conversant with the system. End points will be the presence and size of the tumours at the challenge site 7, 14 and 21 days after challenge.<br><br>
f<br><br>
Preliminary investigations suggest that at least one of the test bacteria will delay tumour development and reduce tumour progression.<br>
Example 14: To show that the suspensions of whole cells of the bacteria are more effective in modulating immunity than cell extracts, comparative preparations are made and tested in a BCG challenge/Tuberculin skin test system.<br>
100 mg of Tsukamurella inchonensis are suspended in buffered saline (pH8.0) in a pre-weighed centrifuge tube at a concentration of 10 mg wet weight of organisms/ml. The entire 10ml is treated in an ultrasonicator to break open the majority of organisms (70-80%).<br>
The sonicate is centrifiiged at 15000 rpm for an hour in a tube and the supernatant is carefully removed and passed through a ClLim pore-size membrane filter as the test extract. The tube, with deposit, is weighed again to determine the proportion of whole orgaiusms that are not broken open plus cell wall debris etc. This is 64mg. The volume of extract equivalent to 0.0Img T.inchonensis is then estimated and tliis is being compared with the equivalent 0.0Img (approximating to 10^) whole bacilli.<br>
Groups of 10 animals are receiving injections of the extract or bacillary whole cell suspensions (equivalent to O.Olmg/dose) or buffered saline placebo into tlie scruff of the neck at weaning and 7 days later. Two weeks later animals are challenged with BCG. 28 days later Tuberculin testing is performed with readings taken at 24, 48 and 72 hours. (This data will be ready by September.)<br>
Results:<br>
Tuberculin responses in mice following BCG vaccination given after priming with nothing, borate buffer, T.inchonensis whole cells or soluble antigens (filtered sonicate).<br><br>
Tuberculin response following BCG gi\'en to non-primed animals:-<br>
No.	24 hours	48 hours	72 hours<br>
6	9Â±4.2	7.7=3.39	3.67=3.5.<br>
Tuberculin response following BCG given to animals primed with borate buffer alone :-<br>
6	9Â±5.7	6.3Â±7.1	3.1 "=2.93<br>
Priming with borate buffer has no effect on post-BCG Tuberculin test.<br>
Tuberculin response following BCG given to animals primed with whole heat-killed T.inchonensis:-<br>
6	7.3Â±1.03 ,	6.17Â±3.87	1.5i2.07<br>
Priming with whole T.inchonensis decreases Tuberculin responses, notably at 72 hours (Th2 responsiveness).<br>
Tuberculin response following BCG given to animals primed with T. inchonensis soluble preparation (filtered sonicate) :-<br>
6	6.8Â±6.8	11.0+8.0	4.6=6.8<br>
Priming with T.inchonensis filtered sonicate increases responses at 48 hours and 72 hours (Th2 responsiveness). This is probably due to an increase in inflammatory antibody production to shared antigens between BCG and T. inchonensis. The results show that priming with sonicate results in a response which is different from that following priming with whole killed organisms.<br><br>
Preliminary investigations suggest that whole cells of the bacteria are more effective in modulating immunity than cell extracts.<br>
Example 15: Stress in Pigs<br>
To evaluate the effect of whole cells of bacteria from one or more of the genera Rhodococcus, Gordonia, Nocardia, Dietzia, Tsukamurella and Nocardioides on stress in pigs (piglets), one or more species from one or more of these genera were tested in pigs-Measurement of salivary Cortisol is a non-invasive method of quantifying acute stress in laboratory, farm, wild captive and free-living animals. We detail below a method of saliva collection from pigs or sheep and the use of a commercially available Cortisol enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) designed to measure Cortisol in human<br>
saliva. This ELISA kit has successfiilly been used to measure salivary Cortisol in pigs<br>
Â« and sheep.<br>
METHOD<br>
Collection of saliva samples.<br>
1.	Pigs have a strong circadian (daily) Cortisol rhythm which means that they naturally have higher levels of sfress hormones in the morning than later on in the day. hi pigs, the highest Cortisol levels are found in at 0700 h and decrease toward midday. For this reason it is vital that saliva samples are always taken at the same time of day.<br>
2.	Feedmg and drinking can affect the concentration of hormones in saliva. To obtain the most realistic results, take saliva samples when the pigs are not feeding or drinking. It is best to take samples before they feed or drink.	-   -<br>
3.	For small pigs, get the pig to chew on standard cotton wool buds (coloured ones are easier to find in hay) while you hold the other end. Approximately four cotton buds (both ends) should collect enough saliva for each pig. For larger pigs use the large<br><br>
corton wool buds to collect saliva from the inside cheek. Approximately two large cotton buds should collect enough saliva. A minimum of 0.2ml saliva is needed per pig.<br>
4.	Immediately after collection, cut the cotton bud to fit inside an ependorf microÂ¬centrifuge tube. Place the cotton bud in the ependorf with the cotton bit at the top. Centrifuge at top speed for approximately t^vo minutes or until the saliva has settled at the bottom of the ependorf Flick the top of the bud to obtain the remaining saliva from the hollow part.<br>
5.	A minimum of 0.1ml (first mark on ependorf) of saliva should be collected in each ependorf by centrifiiging more than one cotton bud per ependorf, but one at time. Collect two ependorfs per pig.<br>
6.	Clearly mark the ependorf with identity numbers and the date.<br>
7.	As soon as possible store saliva samples in air-tight re-sealable bags in the freezer, preferably at "20 Â°C.<br>
Cortisol Assay.<br>
1.	Draw up a plate plan.<br>
2.	Remove saliva samples from the freezer and allow to defrost.<br>
3.	Switch the oven on at 25 Â°C<br>
4.	Bring ELISA reagents to room temperature before use.<br>
5.	Dilute wash solution following manufacturers instructions.<br>
6.	Dispense 100 p.1 of Cortisol standards and saliva samples in duplicate into appropriate wells.<br>
7.	Dispense 200 |il of enzyme conjugate to each well.<br>
S. Shake the plate for 10 sec.<br>
9. hicubate at 25 Â°C (in oven) for 1 hr.<br>
lO.Wash all wells tliree times by disposing of the contents down the sink,   dispense<br>
400 III wash solution into each well using the multichannel pipette, dispos-s of the<br>
contents again and repeat a further two times.<br><br>
11.Tap the inverted plate onto absorbent towels firmly to remove any excess wash solution. The wash stage of the assay is very important, and the plate must be washed properly.<br>
12.Dispense 200 |j,l of substrate solution to each well.<br>
13.Incubate at 25 Â°C (in oven) for 30 min.<br>
14.Without emptying the wells, dispense 100 ul stop solution to each well.<br>
15.Read the plate at 450nm within 10 min of adding the stop solution.<br>
Salivary Cortisol ELISA kit.<br>
Kit of 96 wells for human saliva, available from:<br>
Immunodiagnostic Systems Ltd, lODidcotWay, Boldon Business Park, Boldon,<br>
Tyne and Wear, NE35 9PD.<br>
One or more saliva swabs will be taken from each animal at 3 weeks, at 64 days and at marketing aged 4-5 months. The saliva will be analysed for stress-related hormones, in particular Cortisol.<br>
It is expected that one or more of the test bacteria will reduce stress by neuro-endocrino inununological mechanisms.<br>
Example 16: Treatment of Equine Sarcoid<br>
Equine sarcoid, the conmionest skin neoplasm of horses, is associated with infection witl bovine papilloma viruses 1 and 2.<br><br>
A six-year old gelding (3/4 thoroughbred; V-t Belgian warmblood") had developed a numbei of sarcoid lesions over the preceding year or more. In Spring 2002 several small wart-like growths were found high in the groiny'inner thigh area.<br>
In August 2002 - one tumour was near the sheath and when a photograph was taken this lesion was a grape-like cluster of growths about 3 cm m diameter, wliich has started tc ulcerate. Part of this cluster was pedunculated, but was not suitable for ligation. Anothej group of non-ulcerated, wart-like growths had developed at the top of the right foreleg covering an area of about 3.5x2.5cm. Twice-daily treatment with Camrosa ointmen (herbal remedy) was started.<br>
Photographs taken in August 2002 are shown in Figures 15 and 17.<br>
In Aummn 2002, the small sarcoids remained unchanged but the group at the top of the foreleg continued to enlarge to cover an area of about 4.3x3cm and the ulcerating growth near the sheath tripled in size.<br>
January 2003 - the first injection of Tsukamiirella inchonensis was give and the Camrosa ointment was continued twice a day as before. A very gradual reduction in size of all growths was noted during tlie next few months.<br>
Initially, two intradermal injections of Img Tsukamiirella inchonensis were given twc weeks apart some 8-10cm from the chest lesion (i.e. the lesion as the top of f-. ..t,.. foreleg) and in the same lymph node drainage area. Four weeks after the second injection, the chest lesion was flatter and resolving. The large penile lesion (i.e. the lesion near the sheath) was more obviously pedunculated and appeared to becoming necrotic.<br>
A month after the second injection, a third injection of T. inchonensis was given, this time on the left front of the chest in a lymph node drainage area where there were no sarcoid lesions. A month later no further resolution of the sarcoids was observed.<br><br>
A month after the third injection, a fourth was given, this time again within a few cm of tlie lesion on the right chest. A month after that the chest lesion had almost completely resolved, necrosis of the penile lesion was progressing and the other groin lesions were appreciably smaller.<br>
In May 2003 application of Camrosa ointment was stopped for all but the ulcerated growth on which it was continued once daily as a fly repellant.<br>
Photograplos taken in June 2003 are presented as Figures 13,14 and 16.<br>
By August 2003 all but one of the small growths had disappeared as had the group at the top of the foreleg. The growth near the sheath was still ulcerated but now about % of its maximum size and small pieces of tissue flake off when the growth is cleaned.<br>
Photographs taken in August 2003 are presented as Figures 18,19 and 20. It is noted that the sarcoids shown in Figure 17 had completely healed by August 2003 following administration of T. inchonensis.<br>
In all, 7 doses of T. inchonensis were given between mid January and mid August.<br>
Conclusion: T. inchonensis preparation was effective to reduce sarcoid lesions. Over all the sarcoids were reduced by about 75%. The preparation was particularly effective when administered into the same lymph node drainage area as a lesion.<br>
This treatment may be particularly important with this condition where there is evidence that the virus is restricted to the lesions and there is little evidence of it in the circulation (Nasir et al Res. Vet. Sci. 1997, 63: 289-290).<br>
These results indicate that inter alia T. inchonensis can be used to treat common skir neoplasms associated with the presence of papilloma viruses. Indicating the present invention will be useful in the treatment of genital warts and/or dysplasia of the uterine<br><br>
cervix that precedes carcinoma of the cer\'ix, for example, both of which are caused b&gt; infection by papilloma viruses.<br>
