The taxoids of general formula (I) in which Z represents a radical of general formula (II) display noteworthy biological properties.<br>
In vitro, measurement of the biological activity is performed on tubulin extracted from pig's brain by the method of M.L. Shelanski et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. sci. USA, 70), 765-768 (1973). Study of the depolymerization of microtubules to tubulin is performed according to the method of G. Chauviere et al., C.R. Acad. Sci., 293„ series II, 501-503 (1981). In this study,, the taxoids of general formula<br>
(I)	in which Z represents a radical of general formula<br>
(II)	were shown to be at least as active as Taxol and<br>
Taxotere.<br>
In vivo, the taxoids of general formula (I) in which Z  represents a radical of general formula (II) were shown to be active in mice grafted with B16 melanoma at doses of between 1 and 10 mg/kg administered intraperitoneally, as well as on other liquid or solid tumours.<br>
The taxoids have antitumour properties, and more especially activity against tumours which are resistant to Taxol® or to Taxotere®.; Such tumours comprise colon tumours which have a high expression of<br><br>
the mdr 1 gene (multiple drug resistance gene). Multiple drug resistance is a customary term relating to the resistance of a tumour to different compounds having different structures and mechanisms of action. Taxoids are generally known to be strongly recognized by experimental tumours such as P388/D0X, a cell line selected for its resistance to doxorubicin <dox which expresses mdr></dox>

The taxoids of general formula (I) in which Z represents a radical of general formula (II) manifest significant inhibitory activity with respect to abnormal cell proliferation, and possess therapeutic properties permitting the treatment of patients having pathological conditions associated with abnormal cell proliferation. The pathological conditions include the abnormal cell proliferation of malignant or non-malignant cells of various tissues and/or organs, comprising, without implied limitation, muscle, bone or connective tissue, the skin, brain, lungs, sex organs, the lymphatic or renal systems, mammary or blood cells, liver, the digestive system, pancreas and thyroid or<br><br>
adrenal glands. These pathological conditions can also include psoriasis, solid tumours, cancers of the ovary, breast, brain, prostate, colon, stomach, kidney or testicles, Kaposi's sarcoma, cholangiocarcinoma, choriocarcinoma, neuroblastoma, Wilms' tumour, Hodgkin's disease, melanoma, multiple myeloma, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and acute or chronic granulocytic lymphoma. The taxoids according to the invention are especially useful for the treatment of cancer of the ovary. The taxoids according to the invention may be used to prevent or delay the appearance or reappearance of the pathological conditions, or to treat these pathological conditions.<br>
The taxoids according to the invention may be administered to a patient according to different dosage forms suited to the chosen administration route, which is preferably the parenteral route. Parenteral administration comprises intravenous, intraperitoneal, intramuscular or subcutaneous administration. Intraperitoneal or intravenous administration is more especially preferred.<br>
The present invention also comprises pharmaceutical compositions containing at least one taxoid of general formula (I), in a sufficient amount suitable for use in human or veterinary therapy. The compositions may be prepared according to the customary methods, using one or more pharmaceu|tically acceptable adjuvants, vehicles or excipients. Suitable vehicles<br><br>
include diluents, sterile aqueous media and various non-toxic solvents. Preferably,, the compositions take the form of aqueous solutions or suspensions, injectable solutions which can contain emulsifying agents, colourings, preservatives or stabilizers. However, the compositions may also be provided in the form of tablets, pills, powders or granules which can be administered via the oral route.<br>
The choice of adjuvants or excipients may be determined by the solubility and the chemical properties of the compound, the particular mode of administration and good pharmaceutical practice.<br>
For parenteral administration, sterile,<br>
aqueous or non-aqueous solutions or suspensions are<br>
used. For the preparation of non-aqueous solutions or<br>
suspensions, natural vegetable oils such as olive oil,<br>
sesame oil or liquid petroleum, or injectable organic<br>
esters such as ethyl oleate, may be used. The sterile<br>
aqueous solutions can consist of a solution of a<br>
pharmaceutieally acceptable salt dissolved in water.<br>
The aqueous solutions are suitable for intravenous<br>
administration provided the pH is appropriately<br>
adjusted and the solution is made isotonic, for example<br>
with a sufficient amount of sodium chloride or glucose.<br>
The sterilization may be carried out by heating or by<br>
any other means which does not adversely affect the<br>
composition.	j<br>
It is clearly understood that all the<br><br>
compounds participating in the compositions according to the invention must be pure and non-toxic in the amounts used.<br>
The compositions can contain at least 0.01 % of therapeutically active compound. The amount of active principle in a composition is such that a suitable dosage can be prescribed. Preferably, the compositions are prepared in such a way that a single dose contains from 0.01 to 1000 mg approximately of active principle for parenteral administration.<br>
The therapeutic treatment may be performed concurrently with other therapeutic treatments including antineoplastic drugs, monoclonal antibodies, immunotherapy or radiotherapy or biological response modifiers. The response modifiers include, without implied limitation, lymphokines and cytokines such as interleukins, interferons (a, @  or S)   and TNF. Other chemotherapeutic agents which are useful in the treatment of disorders due to abnormal cell proliferation include, without implied limitation, alkylating agents, for instance nitrogen mustards such as mechlorethamine, cyclophosphamide, melphalan and chlorambucil, alkyl sulphonates such as busulfan, nitrosoureas such as carmustine, lomustine, semustine and streptozocin, triazenes such as dacarbazine, antimetabolites such as folic acid analogues, for instance methotrexate, pyrimidine analogues such as fluorouracil and cytarabine, purine analogues such as<br><br>
mercaptopurine and thioguanine, natural products, for instance vinca alkaloids such as vinblastine, vincristine and vindesine, epipodophyllotoxins such as etoposide and teniposide, antibiotics such as dactinomycin, daunorubicin, doxorubicin, bleomycin, plicamycin and mitomycin, enzymes such as L-asparaginase, various agents such as coordination complexes of platinum, for instance cisplatin, substituted ureas such as hydroxyurea, methylhydrazine derivatives such as procarbazine, adrenocortical suppressants such as mitotane and aminoglutethimide, hormones and antagonists such as adrenocorticosteroids such, as prednisone, progestins such as hydroxyprogesterone caproate, methoxyprogesterone acetate and megestrol acetate, ©estrogens such as diethylstilboestrol and ethynyloestradiol, antioestrogens such as tamoxifen, and androgens such a: testosterone propionate and fluoxymesterone.<br>
The doses used for carrying out the methods according to the invention are those which permit a prophylactic treatment or a maximum therapeutic response. The doses vary according to the administration form, the particular product selected and features distinctive to the subject to be treated. In general, the doses are those which are therapeutically effective for the treatment of disorders due to abnormal cell proliferation. The taxoids according to the invention may be administered<br><br>
as often as necessary to obtain the desired therapeutic effect. Some patients may respond rapidly to relatively high or low doses, and then require low or zero maintenance doses. Generally, low doses will be used at the beginning of the treatment and, if necessary, increasingly stronger doses will be administered until an optimum effect is obtained. For other patients, it may be necessary to administer maintenance doses 1 to 8 times a day, and preferably 1 to 4 times, according to the physiological requirements of the patient in question. It"is also possible that some patients may require the use of only one to two daily administrations.<br>
In man, the doses are generally between 0.01 and 200 mg/kg. For intraperitoneal administration, the doses will generally be between 0.1 and 100 mg/kg, preferably between 0.5 and 50 mg/kg and still more specifically between 1 and 10 mg/kg. For intravenous administration, the doses are generally between 0.1 and 50 mg/kg, preferably between 0.1 and 5 mg/kg and still more specifically between 1 and 2 mg/kg. It is understood that, in order to choose the most suitable dosage, account should be taken of the administration route, the patient's weight, general state of health and age and all factors which may influence the efficacy of the treatment.<br>
The example which follows .illustrates a composition according to the invention.<br><br><br><br>
EXAMPLE<br>
40 mg of the product obtained in Example 1 are dissolved in 1 cm3 of Emulphor EL 620 and l cm3 of ethanol, and the solution is then diluted by adding 18 cm3 of physiological saline.<br>
The composition is administered by perfusion over 1 hour by introduction in physiological solution.<br><br><br><br>
