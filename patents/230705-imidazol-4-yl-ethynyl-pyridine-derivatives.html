It has now surprisingly been found that the compounds of general formula I are metabo-tropic glutamate reC6ptor 5 antagonists. Compounds of formula I are distinguished by having valuable therapeutic properties. They can be used in the treatment or prevention of mGluR5 reC6ptor mediated disorders.<br>
In the C6ntral nervous system (CNS) the transmission of stimuli takes plaC6 by the interaction of a neurotransmitter, which is sent out by a neuron, with a neuroreC6ptor.<br>
Glutamate is the major exC1tatory neurotransmitter in the brain and plays a unique role in a. variety of C6ntral nervous system (CNS) functions. The glutamate-dependent stimulus reC6ptors are divided into two main groups. The first main group, namely the ionotropic reC6ptors, forms ligand-controlled ion channels. The metabotropic glutamate reC6ptors (mGluR) belong to the second main group and, furthermore, belong to the family of G-protein coupled reC6ptors.<br>
At present, eight different members of these mGluR are known and of these some even have sub-types. According to their sequenC6 homology, signal transduction mechanisms and agonist selectivity, these eight reC6ptors can be sub-divided into three sub-groups:<br>
mGluRl and mGluR5 belong to group I, mGluR2 and mGluR3 belong to group II and mGluR4, mGluR6, mGluR7 and mGluRS belong to group III.<br>
Ligands of metabotropic glutamate reC6ptors belonging to the first group can be used for the treatment or prevention of acute and/or chronic neurological disorders such as<br><br>
psychosis, epilepsy, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, cognitive disorders and memory defiC1ts, as well as chronic and acute pain.<br>
Other treatable indications in this connection are restricted brain function caused by bypass operations or transplants, poor blood supply to the brain, spinal cord injuries, head injuries, hypoxia caused by pregnancy, cardiac arrest and hypoglycaemia. Further treatable indications are ischemia, Huntington's chorea, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), dementia caused by AIDS, eye injuries, retinopathy, idiopathic parkinsonism or parkinsonism caused by medicaments as well as conditions which lead to glutamate-defiC1ency functions, such as e.g. muscle spasms, convulsions, migraine, urinary incontinenC6, drug abuse/dependanC6 such as nicotine addiction, opiate addiction, and alcohol abuse, anxiety, vomiting, dyskinesia and depressions.<br>
Disorders mediated full or in part by mGluR5 are for example acute, traumatic and chronic degenerative proC6sses of the nervous system, such as Alzheimer's disease, senile dementia, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's chorea, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and multiple sclerosis, psychiatric diseases such as schizophrenia and anxiety, depression, pain and drug dependency [Expert Opin. Ther. Patents 12:12 (2002)].<br>
Selective mGluR5 antagonists are espeC1ally useful for the treatment of anxiety and pain.<br>
Objects of the present invention are compounds of formula I and their pharmaC6utically acC6ptable salts, the above-mentioned compounds as pharmaC6utically active substanC6s and their production. Further objects of the invention are medicaments based on a compound in accordanC6 with the invention and their manufacture as well as the use of the compounds in the control or prevention of mGluR5 reC6ptor mediated disorders, and, respectively, for the production of corresponding medicaments.<br>

The invention also relates to the use of a compound in accordanC6 with the present invention as well as its pharmaC6utically acC6ptable salt for the manufacture of medicaments for the treatment and prevention of mGluRS reC6ptor mediated disorders as outlined above.<br>
PharmaC6utically acC6ptable salts of compounds of formula I can be manufactured readily according to methods known per se and taking into consideration the nature of the compound to be converted into a salt Inorganic or organic aC1ds such as, e.g., hydrochloric aC1d, hydrobromic aC1d, sulphuric aC1d, nitric aC1d, phosphoric aC1d or C1tric aC1d, formic aC1d, fumaric aC1d, maleic aC1d, aC6tic aC1d, sucC1nic aC1d, tartaric aC1d, methanesulphonic aC1d, p-toluenesulphonic aC1d and the like are suitable for the formation of pharmaC6utically acC6ptable salts of basic compounds of formula I.

The compounds of formula I and their pharmaC6utically acC6ptable salts (hereinafter: PharmaC6utical Compounds) are, as already mentioned above, metabotropic glutamate reC6ptor antagonists and can be used for the treatment or prevention of mGluRS reC6ptor mediated disorders, such as acute and/or chronic neurological disorders, cognitive disorders and memory defiC1ts, as well as acute and chronic pain. Treatable neurological disorders are for instanC6 epilepsy, schizophrenia, anxiety, acute, traumatic or chronic degenerative proC6sses of the nervous system, such as Alzheimer's disease, senile dementia, Huntington's chorea, ALS, multiple sclerosis, dementia caused by AIDS, eye injuries, retinopathy, idiopathic parkinsonism or parkinsonism caused by medicaments as well as conditions which lead to glutamate-defiC1ent functions, such as e.g. muscle spasms, convulsions, migraine, urinary incontinenC6, nicotine addiction, psychoses, opiate addiction, anxiety, vomiting, dyskinesia and depression. Other treatable indications are restricted brain function caused by bypass operations or transplants, poor blood supply to the brain, spinal cord injuries, head injuries, hypoxia caused by pregnancy, cardiac arrest and hypoglyC6mia.<br><br>
PharmaC6utical Compounds are espeC1ally useful as analgesics. Treatable kinds of pain include inflammatory pain such as arthritis and rheumatoid disease, vasculitis, neuropathic pain such as trigeminal or herpetic neuralgia, diabetic neuropathy pain, causalgia, hyperalgesia, severe chronic pain, post-operative pain and pain assoC1ated with various conditions like canC6r, angina, renal or bifliay colic, menstruation, migraine and gout.<br>
The pharmacological activity of PharmaC6utical Compounds was tested using the following method:<br>
For binding experiments, cDNA encoding human mGlu 5a reC6ptor was transiently trans-fected into EBNA C6lls using a proC6dure desC1-ibed by Schlaeger and Christensen [Cyto-technology 15:1-13 (1998)]. C6ll membrane homogenates were stored at -80°C until the day of assay where upon they were thawed and resuspended and polytronised in 15 mM Tris-HCl, 120 mM NaCl, 100 mM KC1, 25 mM CaCl2, 25 mM MgCl2 binding buffer at pH<br>
7.4 to a final assay conC6ntration of 20 \ig protein/ well.<br>
Saturation isotherms were determined by addition of twelve [ H]MPEP conC6ntrations (0.04-100 nM) to these membranes (in a total volume of 200 \xl) for 1 h at 4°C. Compe-tition experiments were performed with a feed conC6ntration of [TijMPEP (2nM) and IC50 values of test compounds evaluated using 11 conC6ntrations (0.3-10,000nM). Incubations were performed for 1 h at 4° C.<br>
At the end of the incubation, membranes were filtered onto unifilter (96-well white miC1-o-plate with bonded GF/C filter preincubated 1 h in 0.1% PEI in wash buffer, Packard Bio-SC1enC6, Meriden, CT) with a Filtermate 96 harvester (Packard BioSC1enC6) and washed 3 times with cold 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 buffer. NonspeC1fic binding was measured in the<br>
presenC6 of 10 μM MPEP. The radioactivity on the filter was counted (3 min) on a Packard Top-count miC1-oplate sC1ntillation counter with quenching correction after addition of 45 μ-1 of miC1-osC1nt 40 (Canberra Packard S.A., Zurich, Switzerland) and shaking for 20 min.<br>
For functional assays, [Ca2+]i measurements were performed as desC1-ibed previously by Porter et al. [Br. J. Pharmacol. 128:13-20 (1999)] on recombinant human mGlu 5a reC6ptors in HEK-293 C6lls. The C6lls were dye loaded using Fluo 4-AM (obtainable by<br>
FLUKA, 0.2j-iM final conC6ntration). [Ca   ]i measurements were performed using a '    fluorometric imaging plate reader (FLIPR, Molecular DeviC6s Corporation, La Jolla, CA, USA). Antagonist evaluation was performed following a 5 min preincubation with the test compounds followed by the addition of a submaximal addition of agonist.<br><br>
The inhibition (antagonists) curves were fitted with a four parameter logistic equation giving IC5o, and Hill coeffiC1ent using an iterative non linear curve fitting software (XC6l<br>
at).<br>
For binding experiments the Ki values of the compounds tested are given. The Ki value is defined by the following formula:<br>
Ki = IC50 / [l + L/Kd]<br>
in which the IC50 values are those conC6ntrations of the compounds tested which cause 50 % inhibition of the competing radioligand ([ H]MPEP). L is the conC6ntration of radioligand used in the binding experiment and the Kd value of the radioligand is empirically determined for each batch of membranes prepared.<br>
PharmaC6utical Compounds are mGluR 5a reC6ptor antagonists. The activities of PharmaC6utical Compounds as measured in the assay desC1-ibed above are in the range of Ki 
Activity data<br><br>
Activity speC1fically as anxiolytic agents maybe demonstrated in acordanC6 with standard test methods, e.g. as desC1-ibed in the Vogel conflict drinking test [see e.g. review of Mfllan, Progress in Neurobiology 70:83-244 (2003)]:<br>
The Vogel conflict drinking test is a proC6dure that has been widely used as a sC1-eening method for anxiolytics. In this proC6dure, the water intake of thirsty rats is measured under conditions where water intake is suppressed by electric shock. In our version of the test, rats are water-restricted for 23h during three consecutive days. One day after the first water restriction, they are allowed to freely drink for one hour in their home-cage. The second day, they are allowed to lick from a drinking spout in the operant box for 15 min,<br><br>
after which they are allowed to freely drink in their home cage for one hour. On the third -test - day, they are allowed to lick again from a drinking spout for 10 min, but now they reC6ive a 0.5 mA electric stimulus for 0.5 sec every sec that they lick (counted as an interruption of an infrared beam in front of the spout). The electric stimulus suppresses the time that the animals spend drinking, and treatment with PharmaC6utical Compounds partially or completely reinstates normal drinking duration.<br>
PharmaC6utical Compounds can be used as medicaments, e.g. in the form of pharmaC6utical preparations. The pharmaC6utical preparations can be administered orally, e.g. in the form of tablets, coated tablets, dragees, hard and soft gelatine capsules, solutions, emulsions or suspensions. However, the administration can also be effected rectally, e.g. in the form of suppositories, or parenterally, e.g. in the form of injection solutions.<br>
PharmaC6utical Compounds can be proC6ssed with pharmaC6utically inert, inorganic or organic carriers for the production of pharmaC6utical preparations. Lactose, corn starch or derivatives thereof, talc, stearic aC1d or its salts and the like can be used, e.g., as such carriers for tablets, coated tablets, dragees and hard gelatine capsules. Suitable carriers for soft gelatine capsules are, for example, vegetable oils, waxes, fats, semi-solid and liquid polyols and the like; depending on the nature of the active substanC6 no carriers are, however, usually required in the case of soft gelatine capsules. Suitable carriers for the production of solutions and syrups are, for example, water, polyols, suC1-ose, invert sugar, glucose and the like. Adjuvants, such as alcohols, polyols, glyC6rol, vegetable oils and the like, can be used for aqueous injection solutions of water-soluble salts of compounds of formula I, but as a rule are not neC6ssary. Suitable carriers for suppositories are, for example, natural or hardened oils, waxes, fats, semi-liquid or liquid polyols and the like.<br>
In addition, the pharmaC6utical preparations can contain preservatives, solubilizers, stabilizers, wetting agents, emulsifiers, sweeteners, colorants, flavorants, salts for varying the osmotic pressure, buffers, masking agents or antioxidants. They can also contain still other therapeutically valuable substanC6s.<br>
As mentioned earlier, medicaments containing a PharmaC6utical Compound and a therapeutically inert exC1pient are also an object of the present invention, as is a proC6ss for the production of such medicaments which comprises bringing one or more PharmaC6utical Compound and, if desired, one or more other therapeutically valuable substanC6s into a galenical dosage form together with one or more therapeutically inert carriers.<br><br>
The dosage can vary within wide limits and will, of course, be fitted to the individual requirements in each particular case. In general, the effective dosage for oral or parenteral administration is between 0,01-20 mg/kg/day, with a dosage of 0.1-10 mg/ kg/day being preferred for all of the indications desC1-ibed. The daily dosage for an adult human being weighing 70 kg accordingly lies between 0.7-1400 mg per day, preferably between 7 and 700 mg per day.<br>
