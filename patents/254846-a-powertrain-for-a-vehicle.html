POWERTRAIN WITH TORQUE CONVERTER AND AXIALLY COMPACT<br>
SEVEN SPEED DUAL CLUTCH TRANSMISSION<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]	The invention relates to a powertrain having a power source, a<br>
torque converter and a compact seven speed transmission with two friction shifting<br>
clutches.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]	Dual clutch transmissions (DCTs) have been designed with friction<br>
launch clutches that connect a vehicle power source such as an engine to a lay<br>
shaft transmission.  Dual clutch transmissions are known for their sporty,<br>
performance-oriented characteristics. Dual clutch transmissions typically exhibit<br>
good fuel economy due to good gear mesh efficiency and ratio selection flexibility.<br>
Synchronizers are typically used to engage gears with the countershafts to<br>
complete power flow from the engaged input clutch to an output shaft. The<br>
synchronizers have low spin losses; thus, overall operating efficiency is enhanced.<br>
However, dual clutch transmissions have some specific design considerations. For<br>
example, due to the high heat that can be generated during slip, the shifting<br>
clutches must be of a relatively large size and shudder and oil life durability must<br>
be addressed. Additionally, cooling circuits for the friction shifting clutches are<br>
typically relatively complex due to the heat dissipation requirements of these large<br>
clutches. Finally, because lay shaft or countershaft transmissions typically have<br>
many sets of axially-aligned, intermeshing gears, overall axial length of<br>
countershaft transmissions may limit there use in some vehicle designs.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br><br>
GP-308562-PTT-DLT<br>
2<br>
[0003]	A powertrain having a torque converter and dual shifting friction<br>
clutches connectable to first and second concentric intermediate shafts combines<br>
the smoothness and ratio-boosting effects of a torque converter with the low spin<br>
losses associated with synchronizers used in dual clutch designs, while preferably<br>
providing seven fixed forward speed ratios in an axially compact design. Several<br>
aspects of the powertrain contribute to the minimization of axial length. For<br>
example, driving gears connected for common rotation with the intermediate shafts<br>
intermesh with driven input gears connectable for rotation with each of the<br>
respective countershafts, thus functioning as shared driving gears. Preferably,<br>
back-to-back synchronizer pairs are supported on the countershafts between<br>
adjacent intermeshing aligned gear sets such that only four back-to-back<br>
synchronizer pairs are necessary and only four synchronizer selection devices are<br>
required to control engagement of the four pairs. Additionally, a parking gear is<br>
preferably connected for common rotation with one of the countershafts such that<br>
it is radially-aligned with an intermeshing output gear set.  (A radial plane is in a<br>
plane encompassing radii of the driving or driven gears, perpendicular to the axis<br>
of rotation of the input member, output member, intermediate shafts and<br>
countershafts in the transmission. Accordingly, as used herein, components that<br>
are "radially-aligned" are aligned in a radial plane.) Furthermore, positioning of a<br>
transmission oil pump between the torque converter and the first and second<br>
friction shifting clutches allows a clutch hub supporting the friction shifting<br>
clutches to be configured with clutch hub passages for routing oil delivered from<br>
the pump to the friction shifting clutches.<br>
[0004]	Specifically, within the scope of the invention, the powertrain<br>
includes a power source and a torque converter that operatively connects the power<br>
source with a transmission input member. First and second friction shifting<br>
clutches are alternately selectively engagable to operatively connect the<br>
transmission input member with first and second concentric intermediate shafts,<br><br>
GP-308562-PTT-DLT<br>
3<br>
respectively. A first input driving gear is connected for common rotation with the<br>
first intermediate shaft and intermeshes with a first pair of driven input gears that<br>
are each connectable for common rotation to a different respective one of the<br>
countershafts to selectively transfer torque to the respective countershaft when the<br>
first friction input clutch is engaged. Furthermore, a second input driving gear is<br>
connected for common rotation with the second intermediate shaft and intermeshes<br>
with a second pair of input gears each connectable for common rotation with a<br>
different respective one of the countershafts to selectively transfer torque to the<br>
respective countershaft when the second friction input clutch is engaged. Thus,<br>
when torque is provided through either of the friction clutches to the countershafts,<br>
shared driving gears on each of the countershafts transfer the torque to one of the<br>
countershafts, depending on synchronizer engagements. Preferably, the first<br>
countershaft includes two input driving gears and the second countershaft has two<br>
other input driving gears so that four intermeshing aligned gear sets are used for<br>
input of torque from the first and second friction shifting clutches.  Preferably two<br>
output gear sets are utilized, including a first output gear set that has a first output<br>
driving gear connected for common rotation with the first countershaft and a first<br>
output driven gear connected for common rotation with the output member that<br>
continuously intermeshes with the first output driving gear.  Similarly, the second<br>
output gear set has a second output driving gear connected for common rotation<br>
with a second countershaft and a second output driven gear connected for common<br>
rotation with the output member that continuously intermeshes with the second<br>
output driving gear. Accordingly, the input and output driving gears and the input<br>
and output driven gears thereby form six sets of intermeshing aligned gears. By<br>
utilizing the four back-to-back synchronizers and selectively engaging the friction<br>
shifting clutches, seven forward speed ratios and a reverse speed ratio are<br>
achieved.<br><br>
GP-308562-PTT-DLT<br>
4<br>
[0005]	Unique packaging of the transmission oil pump allows simplified<br>
routing of clutch and lubrication oil and compact piloting of a clutch hub that<br>
supports the dual friction shifting clutches. Specifically, the clutch hub is<br>
configured with clutch hub passages for routing oil delivered from the transmission<br>
oil pump to the first and second friction shifting clutches. Preferably, a stationary<br>
clutch hub support member at least partially supports the clutch hub and is<br>
configured with clutch hub support member passages that are in fluid<br>
communication with the clutch hub passages so that oil may be routed from the<br>
transmission oil pump to the friction shifting clutches through the stationary clutch<br>
hub support member. The transmission oil pump is preferably radially-inward of<br>
and partially surrounded by the stationary clutch hub support member. Preferably,<br>
a stator support shaft connects a stator portion of the torque converter with the<br>
clutch hub support member. The oil pump is positioned radially-outward of the<br>
stator support shaft. Preferably the stator support shaft is configured with stator<br>
support shaft passages that are in fluid communication with the oil pump to route<br>
oil delivered from the oil pump to the torque converter.<br>
[0006]	The above features and advantages and other features and advantages<br>
of the present invention are readily apparent from the following detailed description<br>
of the best mode for carrying out the invention when taken in connection with the<br>
accompanying drawings.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
[0007]	FIGURE 1 is a schematic illustration of a first embodiment of a<br>
powertrain with an engine, a torque converter, a transmission with dual friction<br>
shifting clutches, and an oil pump positioned between the torque converter and the<br>
friction shifting clutches;<br><br>

[0008]	FIGURE 2 is a table showing an engagement schedule of the<br>
friction shifting clutches and synchronizers in the powertrain of Figure 1 to<br>
achieve seven forward speed ratios and a reverse speed ratio; and<br>
[0009]	FIGURE 3 is a partial schematic fragmentary illustration of the<br>
torque converter, oil pump and friction shifting clutches of the powertrain of<br>
Figure 1, showing a clutch hub, a clutch hub support member and a stator shaft<br>
support member that enable routing of oil from the oil pump to the torque<br>
converter and to the friction shifting clutches.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
[0010]	Referring to the drawings, wherein like reference numbers represent<br>
the same or corresponding parts throughout the several views, there is shown in<br>
Figure 1 a powertrain 10 for a vehicle (not shown). The powertrain 10 includes a<br>
power source or engine 14, a torque converter 16 and a transmission 18. The torque<br>
converter 16 includes a turbine portion 20, a pump portion 22, and a stator portion<br>
24. An engine output shaft 23 is connected for rotation with a hub member 25 that<br>
is connected to the pump portion 22. The turbine portion 20 is connected with a<br>
transmission input member 26. A fluid coupling between the pump portion 22 and<br>
the turbine portion 20 thus operatively connects the engine 14 with the transmission<br>
input member 26. The transmission input member 26 is preferably in the nature of a<br>
shaft. Selective engagement of a torque converter clutch 28 allows the engine 14 to<br>
be directly connected with the input member 26, bypassing the torque converter 16.<br>
Preferably, the torque converter clutch 28 is electronically controlled and may be<br>
enhanced with the multitude of clutch plates to provide a large clutch torque<br>
capacity, thus making the converter clutch 28 able to transmit a large amount of<br>
torque. The stator portion 24 is grounded to a stationary member, such as the<br>
transmission housing 30, through a typical one-way clutch 32. A damper 34 is<br>
operatively connected to the torque converter clutch 28 for absorbing vibration. A<br>
transmission oil pump 36 is operatively connected for rotation with the pump<br><br>
GP-308562-PTT-DLT<br>
6<br>
portion 22. Support for the pump 36 and fluid communication from the pump 36 to<br>
the transmission 18 and to the torque converter 16 will be discussed hereinafter.<br>
Briefly, a stator support shaft 38 supports the stator and is located radially-inward of<br>
the pump 36. The stator support shaft 38 operatively supports the stator portion 24<br>
and is connected with a stationary clutch hub support member 40 that is grounded to<br>
the transmission housing 30. A clutch hub 42 operatively connects the input<br>
member 26 with first and second concentric intermediate shafts 44, 46 by selective<br>
engagement of first and second friction shifting clutches CO and CE, respectively.<br>
[0011]	The transmission 18 further includes countershafts 50 and 52 which<br>
are axially-spaced from and generally parallel with the intermediate shafts 44 and<br>
46.<br>
[0012]	Six aligned, intermeshing gear sets are utilized to transfer torque from<br>
the intermediate shafts 44, 46 via the countershafts 50, 52 to an output member 56<br>
(preferably in the form of a shaft) to establish multiple speed ratios between the<br>
input member 26 and the output member 56. The output member 56 is connected to<br>
a final drive mechanism 58 which may be connected to vehicle wheels (not shown).<br>
[0013]	A first intermeshing gear set includes gears 60, 62 and 64. Gear 60 is<br>
a shared input driving gear that is connected for common rotation with intermediate<br>
shaft 44 and continuously intermeshes with both gears 62 and 64. Gear 62 is<br>
rotatable about countershaft 50 and is selectively connectable therewith. Gear 64 is<br>
rotatable about countershaft 52 and is selectively connectable therewith. A second<br>
intermeshing gear set includes gears 66, 68 and 70. Gear 66 is connected for<br>
common rotation with intermediate shaft 44 and continuously intermeshes with both<br>
gears 68 and 70. Gear 68 is rotatable about and selectively connectable with<br>
countershaft 50. Gear 70 is rotatable about and selectively connectable with<br>
countershaft 52. A third intermeshing gear set includes gears 72, 74 and 76. Gear<br>
72 is connected for common rotation with intermediate shaft 46 and continuously<br>
intermeshes with both gears 74 and 76. Gear 74 is rotatable about and selectively<br>
connectable for rotation with countershaft 50. Gear 76 is rotatable about and<br>
selectively connectable for rotation with countershaft 52. A fourth intermeshing<br><br>
GP-308562-PTT-DLT<br>
7<br>
gear set includes gear 78, gear 80, gear 82, and gear 84. Gear 78 is connected for<br>
common rotation with intermediate shaft 46. Gear 78 continuously intermeshes with<br>
both gear 80 and gear 82. Gear 82 continuously intermeshes with gear 84. Gear 80<br>
is rotatable about and selectively connectable for common rotation with countershaft<br>
50. Gear 82 is an idler gear supported on a separate axis I. Gear 84 is rotatable<br>
about and selectively connectable with countershaft 52. Gears 60, 66, 72 and 78 are<br>
referred to herein as input driving gears. Gears 62, 64, 68, 70, 74, 76, 80, and 84 are<br>
referred to herein as input driven gears.<br>
[0014]	The transmission includes a fifth intermeshing, aligned gear set that<br>
includes gear 86 and gear 88. Gear 86 is connected for common rotation with<br>
countershaft 52 and continuously intermeshes with gear 88 which is connected for<br>
common rotation with output member 56.   A sixth intermeshing, aligned gear set<br>
includes gear 90 which is connected for common rotation with countershaft 50 and<br>
gear 92 which is connected for common rotation with output member 56 and<br>
continuously intermeshes with gear 90. Gears 86 and 90 are referred to herein as<br>
output driving gears and gears 88 and 92 are referred to herein as output driven<br>
gears. The intermeshing, aligned gear set including gears 60, 62 and 64 may be<br>
referred to as a first input gear set. The intermeshing, aligned gear set including<br>
gears 66, 68 and 70 may be referred to as a second input gear set. The intermeshing,<br>
aligned gear set including gears 72, 74 and 76 may be referred to a third input gear<br>
set. The intermeshing, aligned gear set 78, 80, 82 and 84 may be referred to herein<br>
as fourth intermeshing gear set. The gear set including gears 90, 92 may be referred<br>
to as a first output gear set and the gear set including gears 88 and 86 may be<br>
referred to as a second output gear set. The four input gear sets utilize shared input<br>
driving gears: gear 60, gear 66, gear 72 and gear 78. Each of the input driving gears<br>
60, 66, 72 and 78 intermesh with gears that are connectable for rotation with each of<br>
the countershafts 50, 52. Thus, the shared input driving gears are each able to<br>
transfer torque to both of the countershafts, the countershaft to which torque is<br>
transferred being dependent on the engagement of synchronizers, as will be<br>
described herein.<br><br>
GP-308562-PTT-DLT<br>
8<br>
[0015]	A parking gear 94 is radially-aligned with the output gear set 90, 92.<br>
Thus, the parking gear 94 is situated in what may otherwise be unused, empty space<br>
and does not require any addition to the axial length of the transmission 18.<br>
[0016]	The transmission 18 includes four pairs of back-to-back<br>
synchronizers: A, B, C and D. Back-to-back synchronizer pair A includes<br>
synchronizer Al and synchronizer A3. Synchronizer Al is selectively engagable to<br>
connect gear 64 for common rotation with countershaft 52. Synchronizer A3 is<br>
selectively engagable to connect gear 70 for common rotation with countershaft 52.<br>
A single synchronizer selection device 96 is operable to engage either synchronizer<br>
Al or A3. Specifically, synchronizer selection device 96 is shiftable to the left to<br>
engage synchronizer Al and shiftable to the right the engage synchronizer A3.<br>
[0017]	Back-to-back synchronizer pair B includes synchronizers B2 and BR.<br>
Synchronizer B2 is selectively engagable to connect gear 76 for common rotation<br>
with countershaft 52. Synchronizer BR is selectively engagable to connect gear 84<br>
for common rotation with countershaft 52. A single synchronizer selection device<br>
98 is operable to control engagement of both synchronizer B2 and synchronizer BR.<br>
Specifically, synchronizer selection device 98 is shiftable to the left to engage<br>
synchronizer B2 and shiftable to the right to engage synchronizer BR.<br>
[0018]	Back-to-back synchronizer pair C includes synchronizer C5 and<br>
synchronizer C7. Synchronizer C5 is selectively engagable to connect gear 62 for<br>
common rotation with the countershaft 50. Synchronizer C7 is selectively to<br>
connect gear 68 for common rotation with countershaft 50. A single synchronizer<br>
selection device 100 is operable to control engagement of both the synchronizers C5<br>
and C7. Specifically, synchronizer selection device 100 is shiftable to the left to<br>
engage synchronizer C5 and shiftable to the right the engage synchronizer C7.<br>
[0019]	Back-to-back synchronizer pair D includes synchronizer D6 and<br>
synchronizer D4. Synchronizer D6 is selectively engagable to connect gear 74 for<br>
common rotation with countershaft 50. Synchronizer D4 is selectively engagable to<br>
connect gear 80 for common rotation with countershaft 50. A single synchronizer<br>
selection device 102 is operable to control engagement of both synchronizers D6<br><br>
GP-308562-PTT-DLT<br>
9<br>
and D4. Specifically, synchronizer selection device 102 is shiftable to the left to<br>
engage synchronizer D6 and shiftable to the right to engage synchronizer D4.<br>
[0020]	Referring to Figure 2, the engagement schedule of the shifting<br>
friction clutches CO and CE as well as the synchronizers is shown. As indicated in<br>
Figure 2, seven forward gears (i.e., speed ratios) and a reverse gear (i.e., speed ratio)<br>
are achieved. Those skilled in the art will recognize that the gears shown in Figure 1<br>
may be designed with various tooth counts that, when the clutches and synchronizers<br>
are engaged according to the truth table of Figure 2, will result in seven forward<br>
speed ratios and a reverse speed ratio corresponding with the seven forward gears<br>
and the reverse gear. For example, the following tooth ratios may have different<br>
numerical values: tooth count gear 62/tooth count gear 60; tooth count gear 64/tooth<br>
count gear 60; tooth count gear 68/tooth count gear 66; tooth count gear 70/tooth<br>
count gear 66; tooth count gear 74/tooth count gear 72; tooth count gear 76/tooth<br>
count gear 72; tooth count gear 80/tooth count gear 78; tooth count gear 84/tooth<br>
count gear 78; tooth count gear 86/tooth count gear 88; and tooth count gear<br>
90/tooth count gear 92. The tooth counts are selected to achieve desired speed<br>
ratios, ratio steps, and overall speed ratio.<br>
[0021]	To establish the reverse speed ratio, clutch CE and synchronizer BR<br>
are engaged. By engagement of clutch CE torque is transferred from the input<br>
member 26 to the intermediate shaft 46. By engagement of synchronizer BR torque<br>
is transferred from the intermediate shaft 44 to the countershaft 52 via intermeshing<br>
gears 78, 82 and 84, with gear 82 acting as an idler gear so that gear 84 rotates in the<br>
same direction as gear 78. Torque is transferred from countershaft 52 to output<br>
member 56 via intermeshing gears 86 and 88.<br>
[0022]	To establish the first forward speed ratio, input friction clutch CO and<br>
synchronizer Al are engaged. Torque is transferred from the input member 26 to<br>
intermediate shaft 44 via engagement of input shifting friction clutch CO. Torque is<br>
transferred from intermediate shaft 44 to countershaft 52 by engagement of<br>
synchronizer Al through intermeshing gears 60 and 62. Torque is transferred from<br>
countershaft 52 to output member 56 via intermeshing gears 86 and 88.<br><br>
GP-308562-PTT-DLT<br>
10<br>
[0023]	To establish the second forward speed ratio, input friction shifting<br>
clutch CE and synchronizer B2 are engaged. Torque is transferred from input<br>
member 26 to intermediate shaft 46 via engagement of clutch CE. Torque is then<br>
transferred from intermediate shaft 46 to countershaft 52 via engagement of<br>
synchronizer B2 through intermeshing gears 72 and 76. Torque is transferred from<br>
countershaft 52 to output member 56 via intermeshing gears 86 and 88.<br>
[0024]	To establish the third forward speed ratio, input friction shifting<br>
clutch CO and synchronizer A3 are engaged. Torque is transferred from input<br>
member 26 to intermediate shaft 44 via engagement of clutch CO. Torque is<br>
transferred from intermediate shaft 44 to countershaft 52 via engagement of<br>
synchronizer A3 through intermeshing gears 66 and 70. Torque is transferred from<br>
countershaft 52 to output member 56 via intermeshing gears 86 and 88.<br>
[0025]	To establish the fourth forward speed ratio, input friction shifting<br>
clutch CE and synchronizer D4 are engaged. Torque is transferred from input<br>
member 26 to the intermediate shaft 46 via engagement of clutch CE. Torque is<br>
transferred from intermediate shaft 46 to countershaft 50 via engagement of<br>
synchronizer D4 through intermeshing gears 78 and 80. Torque is transferred from<br>
countershaft 50 to output member 56 through intermeshing gears 90 and 92.<br>
[0026]	A fifth forward speed ratio is established by engagement of input<br>
friction shifting clutch CO and synchronizer C5. Torque is transferred from input<br>
member 26 to intermediate shaft 44 via engagement of clutch CO. Torque is<br>
transferred from intermediate shaft 44 to countershaft 50 via engagement of<br>
synchronizer C5 through intermeshing gears 60 and 62. Torque is transferred from<br>
countershaft 50 to output member 56 through intermeshing gears 90 and 92.<br>
[0027]	A sixth forward speed ratio is established by engagement of input<br>
friction shifting clutch CE and synchronizer D6. Torque is transferred from input<br>
member 26 to intermediate shaft 46 via engagement of clutch CE. Torque is<br>
transferred from intermediate shaft 46 to countershaft 50 via engagement of<br>
synchronizer D6 through intermeshing gears 72 and 74. Torque is transferred from<br>
countershaft 50 to output member 56 through intermeshing gears 90 and 92.<br><br>
GP-308562-PTT-DLT<br>
11<br>
[0028]	A seventh forward speed ratio is established via engagement of input<br>
friction shifting clutch CO and synchronizer C7. Torque is transferred from input<br>
member 26 to intermediate shaft 44 via engagement of input friction shifting clutch<br>
CO. Torque is transferred from intermediate shaft 44 to countershaft 50 via<br>
engagement of synchronizer C7 through intermeshing gears 66 and 68. Torque is<br>
transferred from countershaft 52 to output member 56 through intermeshing gears 90<br>
and 92.<br>
[0029]	Referring to Figure 3, torque converter 16, pump 36, stationary clutch<br>
hub support member 40, clutch hub 42 and stator support shaft 38 are shown in<br>
greater detail. The transmission oil pump 36 is operatively connected to the pump<br>
portion 22 of the torque converter 16 and to the engine output member 23 via pump<br>
portion hub member 25. The stator portion 24 is operatively connected to stator<br>
support shaft 38 which is connected with stationary clutch hub support member 40.<br>
The transmission housing 30 is bolted or otherwise connected with the stationary<br>
member clutch hub support member 40. Thus, the pump 36 is radially-outward of<br>
the stator support shaft 38 and is radially-inward of and supported by the stationary<br>
clutch hub support member 40.<br>
[0030]	Turbine portion 20 is operatively connected for rotation with the<br>
input member 26. Input member 26 in turn is operatively connected for rotation<br>
with clutch hub 42. Clutch hub 42 supports a portion of the friction input shifting<br>
clutches CO and CE. Friction input shifting clutch CO has another portion<br>
operatively connected for rotation with intermediate shaft 44. Friction input shifting<br>
clutch CE has another portion operatively connected for rotation with intermediate<br>
shaft 46. Engagement of clutch CO connects the input member 26 and clutch hub<br>
42 for rotation with intermediate shaft 44. Engagement of clutch CE connects the<br>
input member 26 and clutch hub 42 for rotation with intermediate shaft 46.<br>
[0031]	Transmission oil from pump 36 is routed to the torque converter 16<br>
and to the friction shifting clutches CO and CE. Torque converter clutch apply oil is<br>
routed from the pump 36 to the torque converter 16 via a sleeve passage 101 which<br>
is an annular passage between the pump portion sleeve shaft 103 and the stator<br><br>
GP-308562-PTT-DLT<br>
12<br>
support shaft 38. The pump portion sleeve shaft 103 operatively connects the pump<br>
portion 22 to the pump 36. Torque converter clutch release oil is also routed to the<br>
torque converter 16 through stator support shaft passage 104 in the stator support<br>
shaft 38. The oil makes its way from the pump 36 to the stator support shaft passage<br>
104 through the horizontally running crevice 108 between the stationary clutch hub<br>
support member 40 and the stator support shaft 38. Lubrication oil for gears<br>
supported on intermediate shafts 44 and 46 is delivered via lubrication passage 106.<br>
[0032]	The stationary clutch hub support member 40 also has clutch hub<br>
support member passages 110 and 112 formed therein to direct clutch apply oil from<br>
the pump 36 via the horizontal crevice 108 to clutch hub passages 114 and 116. The<br>
clutch hub 42 also has additional passages (not shown) in fluid communication with<br>
one another for delivering dam oil to the clutches CO and CE. These additional dam<br>
oil passages are located in a different radial plane than passages 114 and 116.<br>
Clutch hub passage 114 directs oil to the input friction clutch CE and clutch hub<br>
passage 116 directs oil to the input friction clutch CO.<br>
[0033]	Passage 118 is an oil supply to pump 36 in housing 30 and is fluidly<br>
communicable with a filter (not shown) through which oil is supplied to the pump<br>
36. Multiple valves, represented by valve 120, control oil flow through passages<br>
101,104, 106, 108,110, 112,114 and 116 and communicate with one or more valve<br>
bodies (not shown).<br>
[0034]	Thus, the unique packaging of the oil pump 36 adjacent the clutch<br>
hub 42 enables a relatively simple cooling circuit for the friction shifting clutches<br>
CO and CE through the stationary clutch hub support member passages 110, 112<br>
and the clutch hub passages 114, 116. During assembly of the transmission 18, the<br>
clutch hub 42 is piloted over the stationary hub support member 40, which serves to<br>
partially support both the clutch hub 42 and the pump 36.<br>
