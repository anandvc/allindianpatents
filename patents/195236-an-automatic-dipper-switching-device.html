				<td>This invention relates to an automatic dipper switching device for use with on vehicles for causing automatic head light beam shifting, dipper and signaling light operation.<br>
Now a days the head light beam shifting dipper and signal indicator light operation is controlled by the driver manually by operating different switches. Sometime due to mistake/carelessness of the driver the switches are not operated in the night time and which causes the accidents on the highways.<br>
Therefore, the main object of this invention is to provide a device for automatic head light beam shifting dipper and operating signaling lights of the vehicles in the night time on highways.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a device which works in parallel with the existing manually operated dipper and signaling device provided in the vehicles.<br>
An automatic dipper switching device for use on vehicle characterised by a front optical eye comprising a bi-convex lens disposed in the open end of cone structure, a LDR/Sensor disposed at narrow end of said cone at the focal point of said bi-convex lens for sensing the presence of a light from a vehicle travelling in the opposite direction, said eye connected to a pulse/wave generator provided for generating signals, an amplifier being connected to said pulse/wave generator for amplifying the signal from said pulse/wave generator, the amplified signal from said amplifier connected to a relay of the head light of the vehicle, a back optical eye connected to the common point of the front eye and pulse/wave generator so as to operate the left side indicator of the vehicle.<br>
In accordance with this invention the device has a front optical eye adapted to be<br>
provided on the front of the vehicle so as to sense the light falling thereon. A switch is<br>
provided with the optical eye to be connected with the pulse/wave generator provided<br>
to generate the signal waves. The output of the pulse generator is connected to an<br>
amplifier provided to amplifying the signals received from the pulse generator. The<br>
output of the amplifier is connected to a relay switch provided to switch on/beam<br>
shifting of the head light. Further, a manual head light switch connected with the relay<br>
switch is provided to<br><br><br>
shift the head light beam and to provide the dipper as per the requirement by the driver manually. A back optical eye with a switch and a relay and adpated to be provided at the back side of the vehicle is provided to sense the light of the back side vehicles. The output of the back optical eye switch is provided in series with front optical eye switch to operate the left hand side signal light of the vehicle. A main switch is connected to the input of the front optical eye so as to switch on the optical eye to its operative position in the night time as and when required by the user/driver of the vehicle. Another switch is connected to the back indicator light so as to switch on the indicator manually and as per the requirements.<br>
A device for use with the vehicles  according to  a preferred embodiment is herein described  and illustrated in the accompanying drawings wherein:-Fig.l      shows the diagram of the device;<br>
Fig.2      shows the sectional view of the  optical eye; and<br>
Fig.3      shows the circuit diagram of the  device according to an embodiment.<br>
Referring to the drawings particularly  Fig.l the device comprises a front optical eye 1 having a<br>
sensor switch therewith. A switch 2 is connected to the eye/sensor switch 1 to keep the device either in the city mode or in the highway mode. Whenever the vehicle is driven on the highway the switch 2 is switched to the highway mode so as to operate the device. The output of the switch 1 is connected to the input of a pulse/wave generator 3 provided to generate the signals. The output signal of the pulse generator 3 is amplified by an amplifier 4. The amplified signal from amplifier 4 is connected to a head light L2 through a relay switch 5. Further a head light/dipper switch 6 is connected between the relay switch 5 and the head light L2 for shifting head light beam and to provide dipper as and when required by the driver.<br>
Further a back optical eye with a switch and relay switch 7 is adapted to be provided at the rear side of the vehicles to sense the presence of the vehicle behind said vehicle. The output of the switch 7 is connected to the common point of the eye/sensor 1 and the pulse generator 3. The output of the relay provided with the eye/sensor switch 7 is connected to the indicator light L2 for the operation thereof. A manual switch 8 is provided to switch on/off the indicator light LI when the device is in the city mode.<br>
All the components of the device are energized by the battery of the vehicle and as shown in Fig. 1.<br>
Reference is now made to Fig.2 the optical eye has a bi-convex lense 9 disposed in the open end of a cone like structure 10. A light dependant register (LDR)/sensor is disposed at the narrow end of the cone 10 at the focus point of the bi-convex lense 9 of the eye so as to concentrates the light of the approaching vehicle. The bi-convex lense is provided at the open end of the cone 10 so that it receives the front light only but not the street lights.<br>
working of the device the head light beam of the approaching vehicle is sensed by the optical eye 1 and the sensing switch is switched on to convey the light sensing signals to the pulse generator 3. The signal generated by the pulse generator are conveyed to the amplifier 4 wherein the signals are amplified and operate the automatically relay switch 5 to give the dipper to the driver of the approaching vehicle.<br>
The other optical eye 7 sen&amp;es the presence of the vehicle approaching said vehicle from behind and operates the left hand indicator light L1 to give signals to the driver of the vehicle that he should remain on let side as a vehicle is coming from the front side.<br>
Thus it is seen that by instating the device the drive is free and the beam shifting, dipper and back light signaling is controlled by the device automatically.<br><br><br><br>
WE CLAIM<br>
1.	An automatic dipper switching device for use on vehicle characterised by a<br>
front optical eye comprising a bi-convex lens disposed in the open end of cone<br>
structure, a LDR/Sensor disposed at narrow end of said cone at the focal point<br>
of said bi-convex lens for sensing the presence of a light from a vehicle<br>
travelling in  the opposite direction,  said  eye connected to  a pulse/wave<br>
generator provided for generating signals, an amplifier being connected to said<br>
pulse/wave generator for amplifying the signal from said pulse/wave generator,<br>
the amplified signal from said amplifier connected to a relay of the head light of<br>
the vehicle, a back optical eye connected to the common point of the front eye<br>
and pulse/wave generator so as to operate the left side indicator of the vehicle.<br>
2.	A device as claimed in claim 1 wherein each of said optical eyes is provided<br>
with a manual switch to keep the device either in the city mode or in the<br>
highway mode.<br>
3.	An automatic dipper switching device substantially as herein described and<br>
illustrated in fig 1 to 3 of accompanying drawings.<br><br><br><br></td>
