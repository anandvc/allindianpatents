A SYNERGISTIC ANTISPASMODIC AND ANALGESIC FORMULATION AND TO A METHOD OF MAKING THE SAME<br>
SANJEEV KHANDELWAL,<br>
an Indian National of Prem Nivas, 13, Altamount Road, Mumbai 400 026,<br><br><br>
'2 8 JAM 2005<br>
THE FOLLOWING SPECIFICATION PARTICULARLY DESCRIBES THE INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFORMED:-<br><br><br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a synergistic_antispasmodic and analgesic formulatiqn and to a method  of making the same.<br>
WHAT THE INVENTION ENVISAGES<br>
This invention envisages a synergistic formulation composition containing Camvlofin dihydrochloride and Paracetamol.<br>
The fixed dose combination of paracetamol and camylofin produce a synergistic response in the effective relief of spasm.<br>
In particular this invention envisages a film coated tablet formulation for oral administration Camylofin dihydrochloride and Paracetamol.<br>
Therapeutic effective amount of Camylofin used in the formulation is preferably as camylofin dihydrochloride or any pharmaceutically acceptable salt form such as camylofin hydrochloride, camylofin citrate, camylofin sodium or any other steriochemical pure form of it.<br>
Therapeutic effective amount of Paracetamol used in the formulation is in its pure form as a white, odorless, crystalline powder.<br>
The two active materials in the formulation can be formulated within a dosage form wherein the two active materials are mixed along with excipients to form a uniform blend and thereafter bound with suitable binder to form granules of the mixed active blend or at least one of the active drug can be coated with a suitable polymer for obtaining two different granular mass of each drug.<br><br>
CAMYLOFIN<br>
Camylofm dihydrochloride chemically it is isopentyl 2-[2-diethylaminoethylamino] -2-phenyl ^acetate dihydroghloride of molecular weight 393.4, Molecular Formula C19H32N202 2HC1. Camylofin is a pale yellow oil. Camylofm Dihydrochloride is a white crystalline powder melting point 170 °C and 180 °C, soluble in water.<br>
Brock et a] studied the chemical structure and pharmacological properties of camylofin dihydrochloride in detail. Camylofm has a direct papaverine like spasmolytic action on the smooth muscle and a mild atropine like anticholinergic action, making it one of the most potent antispasmodics. It inhibits the enzyme phosphodiesterase, which in turn causes increase in concentration of cyclic AMP and smooth muscle relaxation. Due to its phosphodiesterase enzyme-IV isoenzyme selectivity, this drug does not interfere with uterine contractility. LD 50 in mice 760 mg/kg orally; 1.35 gmJ kg s.c; 49.2 mg/kg i.v.<br>
Camylofin dihydrochloride primarily acts on smooth muscles (intestine, ureter, cervix) whereas its influence on glands, eyes, heart and circulation is slight and of no clinical significance. It has very mild anticholinergic side effects like dryness of mouth, dilatation of pupils, paralysis of accommodation and palpitations. It has a wide margin of safety. The ratio of the effective therapeutic dose to the toxicity dose in animal studies varies from 1:40 to 1:150.5<br>
PARACETAMOL<br>
Paracetamol is 4-acetamidophenol and may be represented by the following formula<br><br><br>
In some publications, it is described as 4-hydroxyacetanilide or N-acetyl-p-aminophenol and in the US Pharmacopoeia it is known as acetaminophen.<br>
Paracetamol is a white, odourless crystalline powder with a bitter taste, soluble in 70 parts of water (1 in 20 boiling water), 7 parts of alcohol (95%), 13 parts of acetone, 40 parts of glycerol, 9 parts of propylene glycol, 50 parts of chloroform, or 10 parts of methyl alcohol. It is also soluble in solutions of alkali hydroxides. It is insoluble in benzene and ether. A saturated aqueous solution has a pH of about 6 and is stable (half-life over 20 years) but stability decreases in acid or alkaline conditions, paracetamol being slowly broken down into acetic acid and p-aminophenol.<br>
Paracetamol is a peripherally acting analgesic and is well absorbed orally. Paracetamol produces analgesia by elevation of the pain threshold and antipyresis through action on the hypothalamic heat-regulating center. Paracetamol is equal to aspirin in analgesic and antipyretic effectiveness. The production of prostaglandins is part of the body's inflammatory response to injury, and inhibition of prostaglandin production around the body by blocking the cyclooxygenase enzymes known as COX-1 and COX-2 has long been known to be the mechanism of action of aspirin and other non-steroidal anti¬inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen. However, their action in blocking COX-1 is known to be responsible for also causing the unwanted gastrointestinal side effects associated with these drugs.<br>
Paracetamol has no significant action on COX-1 and COX-2, which left its mode of action a mystery but did explain its lack of anti-inflammatory action and also, more importantly, its freedom from gastrointestinal side effects typical of NSAIDs.<br>
Early work had suggested that the fever reducing action of paracetamol was due to<br>
activity in the brain while its lack of any clinically useful anti-inflammatory action was<br>
consistent with a lack of prostaglandin inhibition peripherally in the body.<br>
» Now,  recent  research  has  shown  the  presence  of a  new,  previously  unknown<br>
cyclooxygenase  enzyme  COX-3,  found  in  the brain  and  spinal  cord,  which  is<br>
selectively inhibited by paracetamol, and is distinct from the two already known<br><br>
cyclooxygenase enzymes COX-1 and COX-2. It is now believed that this selective inhibition of the enzyme COX-3 in the brain and spinal cord explains the effectiveness of paracetamol in relieving pain and reducing fever without having unwanted gastrointestinal side effects.<br>
Paracetamol is one of the most widely used analgesics and is regarded to offer highest degree of safety and tolerability in the recommended dose. Although its mode of action is not fully understood, Paracetamol is believed to inhibit cyclo- oxygenase (COX) in the central nervous system, besides exerting action on the peripheral pain chemoreceptors (Bradykinin).<br>
Paracetamol provides temporary relief of minor aches and pains with heartburn or acid indigestion and upset stomach associated with these symptoms. Acetaminophen chewable tablets, elixir, drops, suspension liquid and suspension drops are designed for treatment of infants and children with conditions requiring temporary relief of fever and discomfort due to colds and "flu," and of simple pain and discomfort due to teething, immunizations and tonsillectomy.<br>
Paracetamol at recommended doses is a safe and effective medicine for the relief of mild pain and fever. It is generally available as 500 mg tablets, but is also available in soluble form (also generally 500 mg tablets), and in a variety of combinations. Liquid preparations are also available for young children.<br>
The plasma elimination half-life ranges from 1 to 4 hours for Paracetamol. Paracetamol is distributed throughout most fluids of the body, and is metabolized primarily in the liver. Little unchanged drug is excreted in the urine, but most metabolic products appear in the urine within 24 hours<br>
Paracetamol is rapidly absorbed, the soluble form being absorbed faster than the solid tablet form. The peak blood level for both forms is similar and is usually less than 20 mg/litre following a 1000 mg dose. Peak serum levels usually occur 30 minutes to 2 hours after ingestion. Elimination from the body is rapid with a half-life of about two hours.<br><br>
Paracetamol is primarily metabolised by the liver. Most of it is combined with glucuronide and sulphate, which account for about 90% of the dose excreted. About 5% of the dose is excreted unchanged and a further 5% is oxidised to a benzoquinoneimine, which is then combined with glutathione and metabolised on to cysteine and mercapturate compounds, which are safely excreted.<br>
Paracetamol and its two primary metabolites are remarkably safe compounds, and the hepatotoxicity of paracetamol arises only through the 5% that is oxidised. The immediate oxidation metabolite, benzoquinoneimine, is a highly reactive substance that normally combines with glutathione. As the dose of paracetamol increases, the quantity of benzoquinoneimine produced increases too. There then comes a point where the glutathione stores in the liver have been completely used up and the rate of production of new glutathione cannot keep up with the rate of production of the benzoquinoneimine. It is at this point that the benzoquinoneimine attaches to liver protein and causes liver injury.<br>
The time required for the liver to become depleted of glutathione, and for the benzoquinoneimine to build up and cause fatal liver damage, is three to four days. During the early stages of this process, there may be few overt symptoms, and it is important that in cases of suspected overdose the patient does not wait for symptoms to appear before seeking medical help. It is estimated that liver injury may begin to occur at a single dose of paracetamol of 15g (30 standard tablets) or over.<br>
New research suggests that paracetamol may help to protect from changes leading to hardening of the arteries, a condition that contributes to many deaths per year from stroke, heart attacks and other forms of cardiovascular disease.<br>
The research indicates that use of paracetamol at recommended doses inhibits the oxidation of certain low-density lipoproteins which carry the 'bad' form of cholesterol, preventing one of the main processes involved in the formation of arterial plaque and hardening of the arteries.<br><br>
Research is continuing into these properties of paracetamol and how it may protect against cardiovascular disease.<br>
Early studies have shown a significant protective association between paracetamol use and ovarian cancer. The effect was apparent after use of paracetamol weekly for a period of six months but was most apparent for women who used paracetamol on a daily basis and who had been using it for more than ten years. There was no similar significant effect from the use of other pain relievers that are available over the counter.<br>
Further research is continuing before any kind of public health recommendations can be made for this apparent protective effect of paracetamol.<br>
