"A CONSUMABLE FILM"<br>
WARNER-LAMBERT COMPANY, a Delaware Corporation, of 201 Tabor Road, Morris Plains, New Jersey 07950, United States of America,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br>
ORIGINAL<br>
637/MUMNP/05<br><br>
GRANTED<br>
5/9/2007<br><br><br><br><br><br>
The present invention relates) to a consumable film.<br>
This invention relates to fast dissolving orally consumable films. The films are<br>
 used to deliver breath deodorizing agents, antimicrobial agents and salivary stimulants<br>
to the oral cavity.   The films can also be used to deliver pharmaceuticaliy active<br>
agents.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
In a more perfect world, people would thoroughly cleanse their mouths after each meal as part of their routine oral hygienic practices. Unfortunately, several factors conspire to prevent widesprea  compliance with this basic requirement of a good oral cleaning regimen.<br>
Oral cleansing can be difficult or inconvenient at times, depending on the nature of the cleansing and the situation in which the cleansing must occur. Brushing, flossing, cleaning your tongue and gargling using a variety of devices and compositions well-suited for the privacy of one's home are common oral care practices. However, the devices and compositions used in oral cleansing practices are less convenient to use away from home, where bathroom facilities might be scarce,<br><br>
unavailable or unsanitary.<br><br>
As brushing, flossing, cleaning your tongue and gargling,in public are not<br>
considered to be socially acceptable behaviors in many, if not all cultures, a variety of<br><br><br>
WO 00/18365	PCT/US99/22115<br>
less obtrusive oral cleansing products have been developed. These include breath-freshening gums and lozenges. Although gums and lozenges have been formulated to achieve a variety of beneficial effects, they are not always socially acceptable. For example, gum is expressly banned from certain institutions, such as schools as well as in certain countries, such as Singapore. Gums and mints are used over extended periods of time, and they require an amount of sucking or chewing action on the part of the consumer, which can be distracting, tedious and undesirable.<br>
Another portable oral cleansing product is a mouthspray. Like a mouthwash, a mouthspray can provide the consumer with a quick burst of strong breath-freshening action, which might be overwhelming in an extended-consumption product like gum or lozenges. On the other hand, mouthsprays are obtrusive. Spraying a mouthspray typically generates a noise, which undesirably draws the attention of the public to the<br>
consumer. Moreover, mouthsprays are typically packaged in relatively expensive and<br><br>
icomplex metal canisters, which can clog in use and are not environmentally friendly.<br><br>
Furthermore, misdirecting the spray not only wastes the product, but can result in irritated eyes, a sticky face and/or stained clothing.<br>
It has been proposed to use an edible film as a vehicle for unobtrusively<br><br>
delivering  breath-freshening  agents.     See JP  5-236885.     This  Japanese  patent<br><br>
application does not, however, teach the inclusion of antimicrobial agents in the film,<br>
using the film to decrease the amount of undesirable bacteria within the oral cavity, or<br><br>
stimulating saliva.   Furthermore, this patent application does not disclose employing .<br><br>

its film for purposes other than breath freshening or within cavities other than the<br><br>

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention provides a physiologically acceptable film, which is particularly well adapted to adhere to and rapidly dissolve in the mouth of a consumer. In a first embodiment of the invention, the film delivers at least one oral care agent, such as antimicrobial agents and salivary stimulants. The antimicrobial agents are effective against germs that cause halitosis, dental plaque, and gingivitis. The salivary stimulants are effective against the condition known as xerostomia or dry mouth. Additionally, the oral care films are a breath freshener effective against oral malodor. The film former used to make the films according to the present invention entraps the oral care agents in the oral cavity to provide extended efficacy.<br>
In a second embodiment of the invention, the rapidly dissolvable film acts as a<br><br>
vehicle for administering a pharmaceutically active agent orally, through a mucous membrane or an open wound of a patient.<br>
The invention is also directed to a method for producing a supple, non-self-<br><br>
adhering film especially suitable for oral delivery. The method comprises mixing a film forming agent and at least! one stabilizing agent to provide a film-forming mixture; dissolving water-soluble ingredients in water to provide an aqueous solution;<br><br>
WO 00/18365	PCT/US99/22115<br>
combining the film-forming mixture and the aqueous solution to provide a hydrated<br>
polymer gel; mixing oils to form an oil mixture; adding the oil mixture to the hydrated<br>
polymer gel and mixing to provide a uniform emulsified gel; casting the uniform gel<br>
on a substrate; and drying the cast gel to provide a film.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Description of Oral Care Film Compositions<br>
The first embodiment of the invention is a physiologically acceptable film that<br>
is particularly well adapted to adhere to and dissolve in a mouth of a consumer to<br>
deliver an antimicrobial agent that kills germs that cause halitosis, dental plaque and<br>
gingivitis.  Thus, the film can be an effective tool in the prevention and treatment of<br>
halitosis, dental plaque accumulation, dental tartar accumulation and gingivitis.  This<br>
film preferably comprises pullulan, thymol, methyl salicylate, eucalyptol and menthol.<br>
LISTERTNE® brand mouthwash is, perhaps, the most well-known example of<br>
an antiseptic oral composition that has proven effective in killing microbes in the oral<br><br>
WO 00/18365		PCT/US99/22I15<br>
cavity that are responsible for plaque, gingivitis and bad breath. LISTERINE® brand<br>
mouthwash achieves its antimicrobial effect through a combination of essential oils<br>
that penetrate and kill the microorganisms.    These essential oils include precisely<br>
balanced amounts of thymol, methyl salicylate, menthol and eucalyptol (hereinafter<br>
"the essential oils") in a hydro alcoholic solution.   Many bad breath bacteria live in<br>
pits or fissure on the surface of the tongue. Listerine® Antiseptic mouthwash reduces<br>
bad breath because of high concentrations of antimicrobial agents in a liquid medium<br>
that can easily penetrate into these pits and fissures. This would not be possible with a<br>
solid  dosage  form  containing low  amounts  of these  antimicrobial   ingredients.<br>
However, the preferred consumable film of the invention captures a significant portion<br>
of the hygienic benefits and the consumer appeal of LISTERINE® brand mouthwash,<br>
in a more portable and unobtrusively consumed form.<br>
It was a significant challenge to maintain the essential oil interaction and<br>
i relatively high oil content of LISTERINE® brand mouthwash in a film. However, the<br><br>
inventors have overcome this challenge in providing the film of the invention.<br>
A further aspect of this invention is that while the amounts of LISTERINE®<br><br>
essential oils are relatively high for incorporation in a film, the film according to the<br><br>
present invention still delivers a lower total amount of essential oils per unit dose<br>
when compared to that of LISTERINE® mouthwash.    Yet the film suprisingly<br>
provides antimicrobial efficacy in the oral cavity.    The inventors theorize that the<br>
preferred film forming ingredient, pullulan, forms a thin layer on the oral surfaces<br><br>
WO 00/18365	PCT/US99/22115<br>
entrapping the small amount of essential oils which are capable of penetrating into the<br>
pits and fissures of the oral cavity to provide sustained antimicrobial efficacy.<br>
Although the inventors are presently unaware of any other breath-freshening<br>
consumable film that provides antimicrobial efficacy, they are aware of a consumable<br>
film disclosed in JP 5-236885, which is said to possess breath-freshening activity, but<br>
is not described as possessing any ingredients having significant antimicrobial activity. Moreover, JP 5-236885 teaches that its film should contain flavor and extract in amounts of 5 to 7 wt %, with the flavor being added as an oil (the essential oils are not<br>
disclosed), whereas the film of the invention preferably has an oil content of at least<br><br>
about 10 wt %, more preferably about 15 wt % to about 30 wt %, most preferably<br>
about 15 wt % to about 25 wt %.   Except as otherwise noted in the examples, the<br>
amounts of oils and other ingredients in the film are wt% after the film formulation<br>
has been dried to create the film,    <br>
The amounts of the specific essential oils used in the film compositions can<br>
vary as long as they are in amounts sufficient to provide antimicrobial efficacy.<br>
Generally the amount of thymol, methyl salicylate and eucalyptol is from about 0.01 to<br>
about 4 wt % of the film composition, preferably about 0.50 to about 3.0 wt % and<br><br>
even more preferably from about 0.70 to about 2.0 wt % of the film. Menthol can be<br><br>
added from about 0.01 to about 15 wt % of the composition, preferably about 2.0 to<br><br>
	-<br>
about 10 wt % and even more preferably from about 3 to about 9 wt % of the film.<br><br>
The amounts added can be readily determined to those skilled in the art and can<br><br><br>
WO 00/18365	PCT/US99/221I5<br>
exceed these amounts as long as the total oil content does not create sticking or other<br>
processing problems.     In certain embodiments, the essential oils are combined in<br><br>
amounts synergistically effective to kill the plaque-producing germs that cause dental<br>
plaque, gingivitis and bad breath.<br>
A major difficulty in formulating a film having such a relatively high oil<br>
content is that simply increasing the amount of oil in the film without determining the<br>
precise proportions of the many other ingredients typically results in a film that is too<br>
moist and therefore difficult to handle or process. The inventors have discovered how<br>
to provide a high oil content film that is moist enough so that it is not brittle, but is not<br>
so moist that it feels undesirably slimy or significantly adheres to adjacent films.<br><br>
Thus, a non-self-adhering film according to the invention can be stored in contact with<br>
another such film (e.g., in a stack), or can be wound about itself (e.g., around a spool),<br>
without having to place a non-stick agent (e.g., a plastic film, paper or other support)<br>
between adjacent portions of film<br>
The film-forming agent used in the films according to the present invention can<br>
be selected from the group consisting of pullulan, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose,<br>
hydroxyethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, polyvinyl pyrroiidone, carboxymethyl<br><br>
cellulose, polyvinyl alcohol, sodium alginate, polyethylene glycol, xanthan gum,<br><br>
tragacanth    gum,    guar    gum,   acacia    gum,    arabic    gum,    polyacrylic    acid,<br>
methylmethacrylate copolymer, carboxyvinyl polymer, amylose. high amylose starch,<br>
hydroxypropylated   high  amylose] starch,  dextrin,   pectin,   chitin,  chitosan,   levan,<br><br><br><br>
WO 00/18365	PCT/US99/22115<br>
elsinan, collagen, gelatin, zein, gluten, soy protein isolate, whey protein isolate, casein and mixtures thereof.   A preferred film former is pullulan, in amounts ranging from<br>
about 0.01 to about 99 wt %, preferably about 30 to about 80 wt %, more preferably<br>
from about 45 to about 70 wt % of the film and even more preferably from about 60 to<br>
about 65 wt % of the film.<br>
The film of the invention preferably comprises pullulan as a film-forming agent and the essential oils as antimicrobial/flavoring agents, and can further comprise water, additional antimicrobial agents, additional film-forming agents, plasticizing agents, additional flavoring agents, sulfur precipitating agents, saliva stimulating agents, cooling agents, surfactants, stabilizing agents, emulsifying agents, thickening agents, binding agents, coloring agents, sweeteners, fragrances, and the like.<br>
Due to the relatively high oil content in the oral care film, it is preferable to avoid substantial amounts of humectant in the film (and more preferable to have no humectant in the film), so as to avoid producing an overly moist, self-adhering film. In particular, it is preferred to formulate the film with a plasticizing agent other than glycerin, which is also a humectant, and with a sweetener other than sorbitol, which is<br>
a mild humectant.<br><br>
Sulfur precipitating agents that reduce oral malodor can also be added to the oral care films according to the present invention. These agents bind with, and inactivate, the volatile sulfur compounds that cause a large percentage of oral malodor.<br>
Sulfur precipitating agents useful in !the present invention include metal salts such as<br><br>
WO 00/18365		PCT7US99/22115<br><br>
copper salts and zinc salts.  Preferred salts include copper gluconate, zinc citrate and<br><br>
zinc gluconate. The amount of sulfur precipitating agent is from about 0.01 to about 2 wt %, preferably about .15 wt % to about 1.5 wt %, even more preferably about .25 wt % to about 1.0 wt % of the film<br>
Saliva stimulating agents can also be added to the oral care films according to the present invention. Useful saliva stimulating agents are those disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,820,506, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. Saliva stimulating agents include food acids such as citric, lactic, malic, succinic, ascorbic,<br><br>
adipic, fumaric and tartaric acids. Preferred food acids are citric, malic and ascorbic acids. The amount of saliva stimulating agents in the film is from about 0.01 to about 12 wt %, preferably about 1 wt % to about 10 wt %, even more preferably about 2.5 wt<br>
% to about 6 wt %.	<br><br>
Preferred plasticizing agents include triacetin in amounts ranging from about 0<br>
to about 20 wt %, preferably about 0 to about 2 wt %.   Other suitable plasticizing<br>
agents include monoacetin and diacetin.<br><br>
Preferred cooling agents include monomenthyl succinate, in amounts ranging<br>
from about 0.001 to about 2.0 wt %, preferably about 0.2 to about 0.4 wt %.   A<br>
monomenthyl succinate containing cooling agent is available from Mane, Inc.   Other<br>
suitable cooling agents include WS3, WS23, Ultracool II and the like.<br>
Preferred  surfactants   include   mono   and  diglycerides  of fatty  acids   and<br><br>
polyoxyethylene sorbitol  esters, such as,  Atmos  300 and  Polysorbate 80.     The<br><br>
WO 00/18365	PCT/US99/22115<br>
surfactant can be added in amounts ranging from about 0.5 to about 15 wt %, preferably about 1 to about 5 wt % of the film. Other suitable surfactants include pluronic acid, sodium lauryl sulfate, and the like.<br>
Preferred stabilizing agents include xanthan gum, locust bean gum and carrageenan, in amounts ranging from about 0 to about 10 wt %, preferably about 0.1 to about 2 wt % of the film. Other suitable stabilizing agents include guar gum and the like.<br>
Preferred emulsifying agents include triethanolamine stearate, quaternary ammonium compounds, acacia, gelatin, lecithin, bentonite, veegum. and the like, in amounts ranging from about 0 to about 5 wt %, preferably about 0.01 to about 0.7 wt % of the film.<br>
Preferred thickening agents include methylcellulose, carboxyl methylcellulose,<br>
and the like, in amounts ranging from about 0 to about 20 wt %, preferably about 0.01<br>
to about 5 wt %.	<br>
Preferred binding agents include starch, in amounts ranging from about 0 to<br>
about 10 wt %, preferably about 0.01 to about 2 wt % of the film.<br><br>
i<br>
Suitable sweeteners that can be included are those well known in the art,<br>
including both natural and artificial sweeteners. Suitable sweeteners include, e.g.:<br>
A.    water-soluble    sweetening    agents    such   as    monosaccharides,<br>
disaccharides and polysaccharides such as xylose, ribose, glucose (dextrose), mannose,<br>

the sweetener selected. This amount will normally be 0.01 % to about 10 % by weight<br><br>
of the composition when using; an easily extractable sweetener. The water-soluble<br><br>
sweeteners described in category A above, are usually used in amounts of about 0.01 to about 10 wt %, and preferably in amounts of about 2 to about 5 wt %. Some of the sweeteners in category A (e.g., glycyrrhizin) can be used in amounts set forth for categories B-E below due to the sweeteners known sweetening ability. In contrast, the sweeteners described in categories B-E are generally used in amounts of about 0.01 to about 10 wt %, with about 2 to about 8 wt % being preferred and about 3 to about 6 wt % being most preferred. These amounts may be used to achieve a desired level of sweetness independent from the flavor level achieved from any optional flavor oils used. Of course, sweeteners need not be added to films intended for non-oral administration.<br>
The flavorings that can be used include those known to the skilled artisan, such as natural and artificial flavors. These flavorings may be chosen from synthetic flavor oils and flavoring aromatics, and/or oils, oleo resins and extracts derived from plants, leaves, flowers, fruits and so forth,and combinations thereof.   Representative flavor<br>
oils include: spearmint oil, cinnamon oil, peppermint oil, clove oil, bay oil, thyme oil,<br><br>
cedar leaf oil, oil of nutmeg, oil of sage, and oil of bitter almonds.   Also useful are<br><br>
artificial, natural or synthetic fruit flavors such as vanilla, chocolate, coffee, cocoa and<br>
citrus oil, including lemon, orange,; grape, lime and grapefruit and fruit essences<br>
including apple, pear, peach, strawberry, raspberry, cherry, plum, pineapple, apricot<br><br>
WO 00/18365		PCT/US99/22115<br><br>
and so forth.  These flavorings can be used individually or in admixture.  Commonly<br>
	.   .<br>
used flavors include mints such as peppermint, artificial vanilla, cinnamon derivatives,<br><br>
and various fruit flavors, whether employed individually or in admixture.  Flavorings<br>
such as aldehydes and esters including cinnamyl acetate, cinnamaldehyde, citral,<br>
diethylacetal, dihydrocarvyl acetate, eugenyl formate, p-methylanisole, and so forth<br>
may also be used. Generally, any flavoring or food additive, such as those described in<br>
Chemicals Used in Food Processing, publication 1274 by the National Academy of<br>
Sciences, pages 63-258, may be used.    Further examples of aldehyde flavorings<br>
include, but are not limited to acetaldehyde (apple); benzaldehyde (cherry, almond);<br>
cinnamic aldehyde (cinnamon); citral, i.e., alpha citral (lemon, lime); neral, i.e. beta<br>
citral  (lemon,   lime);   decanal  (orange,   lemon);   ethyl   vanillin  (vanilla,   cream);<br>
heliotropine, i.e., piperonal (vanilla, cream); vanillin (vanilla, cream); alpha-amyl<br>
cinnamaldehyde (spicy fruity flavors); butyraldehyde (butter, cheese); valeraldehyde<br>
(butter, cheese); citronellal (modifies, many types); decanal (citrus fruits); aldehyde<br>
C-8 (citrus fruits); aldehyde C-9 (citrus fruits); aldehyde C-12 (citrus fruits); 2-ethyl<br>
butyraldehyde (berry fruits); hexenal, i.e. trans-2 (berry fruits); tolyl aldehyde (cherry,<br>
almond); veratraldehyde (vanilla); 2,6-dimethyl- 5-heptenal, i.e. melonal (melon);<br>
2-6-dimethyloctanal (green fruit); and 2-dodecenal (citrus, mandarin); cherry; grape;<br>
mixtures thereof; and the like.<br>
The amount of flavoring employed is normally a matter of preference subject to<br><br><br>
such factors as flavor type, individual flavor, and strength desired.  Thus, the amount<br><br><br>
WO 00/18365		PCT/US99/22115<br><br>
may be varied in order to obtain the result desired in the final product. Such variations are within the capabilities of those skilled in the art without the need for undue experimentation. In general, amounts of about 0.1 to about 30 wt % are useable with amounts of about 2 to about 25 wt % being preferred and amounts from about 8 to about 10 wt % are more preferred.<br>
The compositions of this  invention  can  also  contain coloring  agents or colorants.  The coloring agents are used in amounts effective to produce the desired color.  The coloring agents useful in the present invention, include pigments such as titanium dioxide, which may be incorporated in amounts of up to about 5 wt %, and preferably less than about 1 wt %. Colorants can also include natural food colors and dyes suitable for food, drug and cosmetic applications. These colorants are known as FD&amp;C dyes and lakes. The materials acceptable for the foregoing spectrum of use are preferably water-soluble, and include FD&amp;C Blue No. 2, which is the disodium salt of 5,5-indigotindisulfonic acid.   Similarly, the dye known as Green No. 3 comprises a triphenylmethane dye and is the monosodium salt of 4-[4-N-ethyl-p-sulfobenzylamino) diphenyl-methylene]-[l-N-ethyl-N-p-sulfonium benzyl)-2,5-cyclo-hexadienimine].   A full recitation of all FD&amp;C and D&amp;C dyes and their corresponding chemical structures may be found in the Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, Volume 5, Pages 857-884, which text is accordingly incorporated herein by reference. Antimicrobial Efficacy of Oral Care Films<br>
The preferred embodiment of the oral care film composition according to the<br><br>
WO 00/18365		PCT/US99/221I5<br>
present invention contains the essential oils used in Listerine® mouthwash to provide<br>
antimicrobial efficacy. The films are shaped and sized to be placed in the oral cavity.<br>
The film adheres to a surface in the mouth, usually the roof of the mouth or the<br>
tongue, and quickly dissolves. The amount of essential oils in one individual film that<br>
is a preferred size for placing in the mouth is significantly lower than that in the<br>
recommended amount, 20ml, of Listerine® mouthwash.<br>
In a preferred formula according to the present invention, the amount of thymol<br>
and eucalyptol in the film is about 70 times less than in the mouthwash.  The amount<br>
of metjyl salicylate in the film is about 46 times less than in the mouthwash.   The<br>
amount of menthol in the film is about 2.8 times less than in the mouthwash.    These<br>
figures are based on comparing a 20 ml dose of liquid mouthwash with a 0.0358 gram<br>
film.<br>
The inventors have unexpectedly found that the  film provides sustained<br>
antimicrobial efficacy at these low amounts of oils.   The inventors believe that the<br>
efficacy of the essential oils is enhanced by the creation of a layer of pullulan in the<br>
oral cavity that holds the essential oils.    This is unexpected because pullulan is water-soluble and the film dissolves very quickly.<br>
The extended antimicrobial activity is shown in the following experiments.<br>
The purpose of these experiments was to determine the antibacterial efficacy of an application of a breath film on tongue malodor microorganisms thirty, sixty or ninety minutes after use. The thirty minute study also tested the efficacy of using two<br><br><br>
WO 00/18365	PCT/US99/22115<br><br>
films.   Subjects' baseline oral malodor microbial recoverable counts were determined<br><br>
by plating the microorganisms recovered from a tongue swab on a selective agar<br><br>
medium. The test product was dispensed and subjects dissolved one or two breath films on their tongue. Subjects remained on the premises and returned for a second tongue swab thirty, sixty or ninety minutes after placement of the test product on their tongue. After a forty-eight hour washout period, subjects returned for a no treatment control.<br>
The thirty minute single film use group showed a reduction in mean log malodor microbial counts compared to the control group. The data was borderline statistically significant (p=0.052): The difference between the one film group and the no treatment control group represented a 42.7% reduction in malodor microbial colony<br><br>
counts.<br>
Statistically significant malodor microbial reduction was also observed with the<br>
two film use group. A 79.6% reduction in malodor microbial colony counts was<br>
obtained (p
Statistically  significant  malodor  microbial   reduction  was  observed   sixty<br><br><br>
minutes after use of a single breath film.   A 69.8% reduction in malodor microbial colony counts was obtained (p=0.002).<br>
Significant malodor reduction was also observed ninety minutes after use of a<br>
single breath  film. A 69.1% reduction in malodor microbial  colony counts was<br><br>
obtained (p=0.006).	<br>
	.<br><br>
WO 00/18365		PCT/US99/22115<br><br>
The data from these studies support the following conclusions: (1) Pullulan polymer-based breath film containing essential oils  is an effective antibacterial composition against oral malodor causing bacteria and (2) significant in vivo bacterial reductions were achieved at thirty, sixty and ninety minutes post use. Experimental Procedures<br>
The procedures used in these antimicrobial studies were as follows. The subject were required to refrain from all oral hygiene procedures (e.g., toothbrushing, oral lavage) eating or drinking any food, beverage or confectionery products from midnight prior to the study and until the study was completed on each test day. Subjects refrained from smoking on mornings prior to the odor evaluations. In vivo Germ Kill Assay 1.        Materials<br>

loosely wrapped in plastic bags to prevent excessive drying.<br>
b.	Panelists refrained from oral hygiene, eating and drinking from midnight prior<br>
to the assay and until the assay was complete. Twelve panelists were used for<br>
the sixty and ninety minute experiments. Eighteen panelists were used for the<br>
thirty minute experiments.<br>
c.	Each panelist swabbed the right side of his tongue by placing the swab at the<br>
midpoint of the tongue and swiping forward to the tip. The swab was placed in<br>
a tube of peptone.<br>
d.	The panelist received a film treatment, either a single or double film.   Panelists<br><br><br>
WO 00/18365	PCT/US99/22115<br><br>
placed the breath film on the left side of their tongue covering the tongue from<br>
the midpoint to the tip and allowed the film to dissolve with the mouth slightly<br>
open for thirty seconds to prevent the film from sticking to the palate.<br>
e.	After thirty or sixty minutes, panelists swabbed the left side of the tongue by<br>
placing the swab at the midpoint of the tongue and swiping forward to the tip.<br>
The swab was placed in a tube of peptone.<br>
f.	The tubes of peptone were vortexed vigorously for 10 seconds, and serial<br>
dilutions were made. The 10-4 dilution was plated in duplicate on OOPS III<br>
Agar using a Spiral Biotech Autoplate 4000 (Bethesda, MD). All plates were<br>
identified with the subject's initials, assay date, sampling time station, and<br>
replicate number.<br>
g. The plates were incubated in an anaerobic chamber at 35-37°C for 7 days to<br>
permit full development of colonies without overgrowth, h. After a 48 hour wash out period, panelists returned for the no treatment control.<br>
No film was applied, and steps (e) through (g) were followed as described<br>
above, i.   After a 48 hour wash out period, the sixty minute panelists returned for another<br>
single film application. Steps (a) through (h) were followed, with the exception<br>
that panelists returned after 90 min in step e. j.   The dark-pigmented colonies (H2S-producing organisms) were counted as<br>

The film used in the in vivo germ kill tests was Example 19 as described in Table 2. The films used in the study were approximately 22mm x 32mm, between about 0.0013 and 0.0015 inches thick and weighed between about 35 to about 37 mg.<br>
The enhanced activity of the essential oil containing pullulan film is also shown<br>
in  Figures   1 and  2.     Figure   1   isa photograph  of an agar plate spread with<br><br>
Streptococcus mutans, ATCC # 25175, to which a piece of an essential oil pullulan<br><br><br>
WO 00/18365		PCT/US99/22I15<br>
film according to the present invention was added. The piece of film delivered<br>
approximately .391 mg of essential oils using Example 15 listed below.<br>
Figure 2 is a photograph of an agar plate spread with Streptococcus mutans,<br>
ATCC #25175 to which drops of essential oils have been added. The drops were 148<br>
ul in volume and contained 0.391 mg of essential oils. The percentages of each<br>
essential oil in the drop are 2.200% menthol, 0.186% eucalyptol, 0.186% methyl<br>
salicylate and 0.1300%) thymol in a hydro alcohol solution.<br>
The area or zone of inhibition around the film in Figure 1 is much larger than<br>
the dimensions of the film. This is due to the presence of pullulan because the oils in<br>
the pullulan film were spread by the pullulan, diffused outward and did not wash away<br>
after repeated rinses.   In contrast, the essential oils in Figure 2 did not diffuse away<br>
from the droplet, remained as ajcircle and easily washed off after 1-2 rinses.   This<br>
shows that the antimicrobial efficacy of the essential oils is enhanced by the presence<br>
of pullulan.	<br><br>
Methods For Preparing Essential Oil Containing Films<br>
Methods   for preparing   films  according  to  the   invention  are  capable  of<br>
encapsulating the oil ingredients within the film-forming matrix and maintaining the<br><br>
integrity of the film, even when the film contains oils in amounts of 10 wt % or more.<br>
In certain methods for preparing films according to the invention, the film-<br>
forming ingredients are mixed and hydrated with water separately from the water-<br>
soluble ingredients, which are mixed in aqueous solution separately from the organic<br><br>
WO 00/18365	PCT/US99/22115<br>
ingredients and surfactants.    In! these methods, the final formulation is preferably<br>
produced by mixing the film-forming phase with the aqueous phase, then mixing in<br><br>
the organic phase, which includes surfactants, such as Polysorbate 80 and Atmos 300.<br>
This mass is mixed until emulsified.   In other embodiments, the aqueous and film<br>
forming phases are combined into a single phase by dissolving the water soluble<br>
ingredients in the water and then adding the gums to hydrate.  The organic phase is<br>
then added to this single aqueous phase.<br>
The resulting formulation is cast on a suitable substrate and dried to form a<br>
film.   The film is preferably air-dried or dried under warm air and cut to a desired<br>
dimension, packaged and stored. The film can contain from about 0.1% to about 10<br><br><br>
wt % moisture, preferably from about 3 % to about 8 wt % moisture, even more<br>
preferably from about 4 to about 7 wt % moisture.<br><br>
The film-forming phase can include pullulan and stabilizing agents such as<br><br>
xanthan gum, locust bean gum and carrageenan. These ingredients are mixed and then hydrated in water for about 30 to about 48 hours to form a gel. The water is preferably<br>
heated to a temperature of about 25 to about 45 °C to promote hydration. The amount<br>
of water is about 40 to 80 % of thejgel. The resulting hydrated gel is then chilled to a<br>
| temperature of about 20 to about 30 °C for about 1 to about 48 hours.  The water is<br>
preferably deionized.<br>
The aqueous phase can include ingredients such as coloring agent(s), copper<br>
gluconate and sweetener.  The water is preferably deionized and the amount of water<br><br>
WO 00/18365		PCT/US99/22115<br><br>
used is about 5 to about 80 wt % of the final gel mixture.<br>
If sodium  saccharin  and  copper  gluconate   are  both   ingredients   in  the<br>
formulation,  it  is  preferable  to dissolve  them   separately  in  solution  to  avoid<br>
precipitation.<br>
In a preferred method of producing essential oil containing films according to<br>
the invention, it is possible to hydrate the film-forming ingredients and combine all of<br>
the ingredients without heating.  The preferred method of producing films comprises<br>
dissolving the water-soluble ingredients in water to form an aqueous mixture; mixing<br><br>
the film-forming ingredients in powder form to form a powder mixture; adding the powder mixture to the aqueous mixture to form a hydrated polymer gel; stirring the hydrated polymer at room temperature for about 30 minutes to about 48 hours; mixing<br>
the cooling agent, thymol and menthol in the flavor oil to form an oil mixture; adding<br><br>
methyl salicylate; eucalyptol and surfactants to the oil mixture; adding the oil mixture to the hydrated polymer gel and mixing until uniform; deaerating the film until air bubbles are removed, casting the uniform mixture on a suitable substrate; and drying the cast mixture to form a film.<br>
The preferred method for making an essential oil containing film hydrates the film-forming ingredients without heating the water. Heating the ingredients increases energy costs in the manufacturing process. Moreover, heating results in undesirable losses of volatile ingredients to evaporation, which also affects the germ killing activity of the composition due to the loss of essential oils. Further, mixing the oils in<br><br><br>
WO 00/18365		PCT/US99/22115<br><br>
two steps minimizes the amount qf flavor lost.<br>
iWhile not wishing to be bound by any theories, it is believed that the film-<br><br>
forming ingredients can be hydrated and mixed without heating due to an ionic effect known as the Donnan equilibrium. Hydrating the film-forming agents in the presence of electrolytes in solution effectively lowers the viscosity of the polymer gel being formed, thus increasing the efficiency of the hydrating process. The water-soluble ingredients of the formulation provide the electrolytes, which are dissolved in the hydration solution prior to addition of the film-forming ingredients. High-shear mixing also accelerates hydration, which delumps the powders, providing greater surface area for water contact. In addition, local heating effects, generated in the shear regions, provide energy for hydration without substantially raising the temperature of the mass.<br>
It is preferable to avoid adding both copper gluconate and saccharin at the same time to the aqueous solution, as a precipitate will form. Thus, it is preferred to combine sweeteners other than saccharin with copper gluconate.<br>

The ingredients used to make the pharmaceutical containing, films are similar to those used to make oral care films.    Specifically, the plasticizing agents, cooling<br><br>
agents, surfactants, stabilizing agents, emulsifiers, thickening agents, binding agents, film formers, sweeteners, flavors and colors described above can also be used in all of the films according to the present invention.<br>
The films that deliver a pharmaceutical agent can also include a triglyceride. Examples of triglycerides include vegetable oils such as com oil, sunflower oil, peanut oil, olive oil, canola oil, soybean oil and mixtures thereof. A preferred triglyceride is olive oil.   The triglyceride is added to the film in amounts from about 0.1 wt % to<br>
about 12 wt %, preferably in a range from about 0.5 wt % to about 9 wt %, of the film.<br>
i The films that contain pharmaceutical agents also can include a preservative.<br><br>
The preservative is added in amounts from about 0.001 wt % to about 5 wt %, preferably from about 0.01 wt % to about 1 wt % of the film. Preferred preservatives include sodium benzoate and potassium sorbate.<br>
The pharmaceutical agent containing films can also include a polyethylene<br>
oxide compound.  The molecular weight of the polyethylene oxide compound ranges<br>
from about 50,000 to about 6,000,000.  A preferred polyethylene oxide compound is<br>
N-10 available from Union Carbide Corporation. The polyethylene oxide compound is<br>
added in amounts from about 0.1 wt % to about 5 wt %, preferably from about 0.2 wt<br>
% to about 4.0 wt % of the film.<br><br>
The pharmaceutical agent containing films can also include propylene glycol.<br><br>

The invention will be illustrated in more detail with reference to the following Examples, but it should be understood that the present invention is not deemed to be<br>
limited thereto.	<br>
Preparation Method I<br>
The following method was used to prepare the films of Examples 1-13.<br>
A.       The film-forming ingredients (e.g., xanthan gum,  locust bean gum,<br>
i carrageenan and pullulan) other than Polysorbate 80 and Atmos 300 are mixed and<br>
hydrated in hot purified water to form a gel and stored in a refrigerator overnight at a<br>
temperature of approximately 4 °C to form preparation A.<br><br>
B.       The coloring agent(s)<br><br>
copper gluconate and sweetener are added to and<br><br>
WO 00/18365		PCT/US99/22115<br>
dissolved in purified water to form preparation B.<br><br>
C.	Preparation B  is added to preparation A and mixed well  to form<br><br>
preparation C.	<br>
D.	The flavoring agent and the oils (e.g., cooling agent, thymol, methyl<br>
salicylate, eucalyptol and menthol) are mixed to form preparation D.<br>
E.	The polysorbate 80 and Atmos 300 are added to preparation D and<br>
mixed well to form preparation E.<br>
F.	Preparation E is added to preparation C and mixed well to form<br>
preparation F.<br>
Preparation F is poured on a mold and cast to form a film of a desired thickness<br>
at room temperature. The film is dried under warm air and cut to a desired dimension,<br>
packaged and stored.	<br>
Preparation Method II<br>
Examples 14-18 were prepared using a preferred method, which comprised the following steps:<br>
A.	dissolve copper gluconate, acesulfame K. aspartame, glycerin,<br>
sorbitol and dye in purified water to form an aqueous mixture;<br>
B.	mix puliulan, xanthan gum, locust bean gum and carrageenan<br>
together in powder form to form a powder mixture;<br>
C.	add the powder mixture from step B to the aqueous mixture from<br>
step A to form a hydrated polymer gel;<br><br>
WO 00/18365	PCT/US99/22115<br><br>
D.	stir the hydrated polymer from step C at slow speed (about 50-<br>
100 RPM) overnight at room temperature;<br>
E.	mix and dissolve cooling agent, thymol and menthol in the flavor<br><br>
oil;	<br>
F.	add methyl salicylate, eucalyptol, Polysorbate 80 and Atmos 300<br>
to the oil mixture from step E;<br>
G.	add the oil mixture from step F to the hydrated polymer gel from<br>
step D and mix until uniform;     <br>
H.       cast the uniform mixture from step G on a suitable backing; and<br>
I.        dry the cast mixture to form a film.<br>
Example 1<br>
Example 1 produced a film according to the invention having a blue-green tint,<br>
a mint odor and a refreshing mint taste.<br>
Examples 2-4	<br>
Examples 2-4 contain sorbitol, glycerin or both.    These examples yielded<br>
products that easily broke off pieces, or were too moist and/or self-adhering. However<br>
they did produce films that rapidly dissolved in the oral cavity with a refreshing mint<br><br>
taste.	<br>
Examples 5-6<br>
Examples 5 and 6 removed glycerin and sorbitol.   The resultant films did not<br>
stick together during processing and packaging and were more moisture stable over a<br><br><br>
WO 00/18365	.	PCTT/US99/22115<br>
long time frame. Examples 7-9<br>
Examples 7-9 were produced to determine the effect of Avicel®   on germ killing activity.     While Examples 7-9 produced more acceptable films from a processing and handling perspective, they had diminished antimicrobial activity relative to films without Avicel®, such as Example 8. Examples 10-15<br>
Examples 10-15 varied the amounts of aspartame and menthol to alter the sweetness and coolness of the film. Example 16<br>
Example 16 was prepared by replacing the sorbitol replaced with maltitol, which has less humectant properties.    The resultant film was less sticky during processing and long term storage. Example 17<br>
Example 17 is prepared in which pullulan is replaced with another film former,<br>
polyvinyl pyrrolidone, to produce films according to the invention.<br>
Example 18	<br>
Example 18 is prepared in which pullulan is partially replaced with another film<br>
former, konjac gum, to produce films according to the invention.<br>
Example 19	<br>
Example 19 represents a film containing a salivary stimulant, citric acid.<br><br>
WO 00/18365	PCT/US99/22115<br>
Example 20	<br>
Example 20 is the film composition used in the antimicrobial efficacy studies described above.<br>
The formulas for examples 1 - 20 are summarized in Table 2. The amounts in these examples are presented as the actual weight (grams) or w/w %. These formulas create the solution/gel that is cast and dried into a film. The actual amount of each ingredient in the finished, dried film depends upon the amount of relative moisture removed during drying.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
