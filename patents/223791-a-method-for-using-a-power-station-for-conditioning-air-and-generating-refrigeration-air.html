				<td>Description<br>
Refrigeration power plant<br>
The invention relates to a power station having at least one<br>
steam turbine and/or at least one gas turbine.<br>
One of today's major objectives to be met by technological<br>
means is to ensure the economical handling of available en-<br>
ergy resources in generating and consuming power.<br>
Power plants which are sizeable in terms of their installed<br>
generating capacity and which supply a large number of con-<br>
sumers and extensive geographical areas with electrical en-<br>
ergy and district heat on a centralized basis are frequently<br>
employed to generate electrical energy and also to decouple<br>
district heat.<br>
The centralized provisioning in this manner of electrical and<br>
thermal energy is cost-effective compared to decentralized<br>
provisioning employing a large number of smaller isolated<br>
plants and is particularly economical in operation.<br>
Said known, what is termed combined heat and power generation<br>
is practically independent of the type of power station em-<br>
ployed, the size of the power station, and the fuel used. The<br>
only crucial factor is for a heat source having a suitable<br>
primary-side temperature to be available for heating a heat-<br>
ing medium. Hot water is today used almost exclusively as the<br>
heating medium.<br>
To implement combined heat and power generation of the known<br>
type, heat that would otherwise have to be entirely or at<br>
least substantially dispersed unused into the surrounding<br>
area is usually decoupled from the power-plant process.<br>
The heat source used for combined heat and power generation of this<br>
type can be, for example, steam from a steam turbine, which steam is<br>
taken, for instance, from a low-pressure section of the steam turbine.<br>
The heating medium can then be heated by the extracted steam through<br>
the latter's passing the condensation heat it contains to the heating<br>
medium by means of heat exchange.<br>
This type of heat provisioning by means of combined heat and power<br>
generation of the kind described is especially economical because<br>
otherwise unused process heat is rendered usable, for example for<br>
heating buildings.<br>
Document US-A-3 041 853 is regarded as the closest prior art. This<br>
document provides a cooling method using an absorption refrigeration<br>
machine. Although the absorption refrigeration machine is not driven by<br>
steam from a steam turbine. This document also does not provide<br>
climate control for buildings.<br>
Contrary to the cited central provisioning with electrical and thermal<br>
energy, to generate refrigeration it is today known how to generate said<br>
refrigeration almost exclusively on a decentralized basis, mostly in block-<br>
type thermal power stations, or directly on site, mostly on the domestic<br>
premises themselves.<br><br>
Said type of decentralized provisioning with refrigeration is very<br>
demanding in terms of cost and energy because either block-type<br>
thermal power stations have to be specially set up for the purpose of<br>
supplying consumers who have substantial refrigeration requirements or,<br>
in the case of refrigeration provisioning carried out directly on domestic<br>
premises, a large amount of electrical energy has to be expended in order<br>
to generate the required amount of refrigeration.<br>
The object of the invention is therefore to specify an economical means of<br>
generating refrigeration.<br>
Said object is achieved by providing a power station which is able<br>
economically to meet a substantial need for refrigeration alongside a<br>
need for mechanical (generally : electrical) energy and which can<br>
furthermore be flexibly employed and, in........................<br>
particular, will overcome the cited disadvantages of known<br>
equipment for generating refrigeration.<br>
Said object is achieved according to the invention by means<br>
of a power station having at least one steam turbine, whereby<br>
to generate refrigeration at least one absorption-type re-<br>
frigeration machine is linked to the steam turbine, with said<br>
absorption-type refrigeration machine being operated by means<br>
of steam taken from the steam turbine, preferably from a low-<br>
pressure section of said steam turbine.<br>
The invention proceeds from a consideration of the fact that<br>
power stations which include a Rankine cycle offer very good<br>
initial conditions for integrating a refrigeration-generating<br>
device.<br>
Owing to factors inherent in the system, power stations of<br>
this type employing a water-steam cycle contain a number of<br>
systems that can be used in a simple manner for coupling an<br>
absorption-type refrigeration machine.<br>
To generate refrigeration it is customary to employ a cycle<br>
in which a liquid refrigerant (such as ammonia, for instance)<br>
is expanded such that it converts to the vaporous phase, then<br>
absorbing heat from a cooling chamber, a condensing-water cy-<br>
cle or another part of the system. The refrigerant vapor is<br>
then condensed and said heat is given off again outside the<br>
cited part of the system by means of cooling. Water is fre-<br>
quently used as the refrigerant for air-conditioning systems<br>
as at near-vacuum pressure it vaporizes at a temperature of<br>
approximately 4°C, meaning that an approximately 6°C cold-<br>
water lead-in can be made available to a condensing-water cy-<br>
cle.<br>
According to the principle on which absorption-type refrig-<br>
eration machines operate, the coolant vapor is condensed by<br>
being absorbed in a solution (for example an aqueous lithium<br>
bromide solution if water is used as the refrigerant), then<br>
re-expelled by heating of the solution and converted into the<br>
liquid phase. This means that instead of a mechanical com-<br>
pressor, which is subject to wear-and-tear and consumes me-<br>
chanical or, as the case may be, electrical energy, an expel-<br>
ler is employed which is operated predominantly (or even ex-<br>
clusively) using thermal energy, with dissipating of the heat<br>
absorbed during vaporization and expulsion now playing a de-<br>
cisive role.<br>
Said heat dissipation can advantageously take place in a<br>
cooling tower or cellular-type radiator of the kind present<br>
in any event in many power stations, for example condensing<br>
power stations.<br>
Just as in the case of generating heat for heating purposes,<br>
operating an absorption-type refrigeration machine requires<br>
the presence of a heat source preferably having a temperature<br>
of approximately 100°C to 120°C. The present invention em-<br>
ploys steam taken from the steam turbine as the heat source.<br>
When the invention is employed in a gas turbine or gas-and-<br>
steam power station, another conceivable heat source is the<br>
hot exhaust gas of the gas turbine, said hot exhaust gas be-<br>
ing extracted in its streaming direction, for example, behind<br>
or in the area of the end of a waste-heat boiler and used for<br>
the heat exchange with the heating medium.<br>
The invention thus further leads to a power station which<br>
contains at least one gas turbine and in which at least one<br>
absorption-type refrigeration machine is linked to the gas<br>
turbine in order to generate refrigeration, with said absorp-<br>
tion-type refrigeration machine being operated by means of<br>
waste heat from said gas turbine.<br><br>
In a power station of this type the absorption-type refrig-<br>
eration machine can advantageously be used, additionally or<br>
alternatively to refrigerating other consumers of refrigera-<br>
tion, for refrigerating intake air for the gas turbine.<br>
Very many existing power stations containing a steam turbine<br>
will permit steam to be decoupled from the steam turbine by<br>
simple means and used to operate an absorption-type refrig-<br>
eration machine. Existing power stations can thus in very<br>
many cases be expanded with modest effort to include the<br>
function of central refrigeration provisioning.<br>
Apart from the necessary heat source for operating the ab-<br>
sorption-type machine, said machine also contains components<br>
that have to be cooled. Examples of these include a container<br>
under vacuum containing the previously cited lithium bromide<br>
solution and requiring to be cooled, and a condenser con-<br>
nected upstream of the vacuum.<br>
These types of components of the absorption-type refrigera-<br>
tion machine that require cooling can, for instance, be sup-<br>
plied with cooling water simultaneously with a condenser of<br>
the steam turbine, said condenser being present in any event<br>
and supplied with cooling water, with said cooling water be-<br>
ing influenced by the ambient temperature and thus having a<br>
temperature for the cited cooling purposes that is suffi-<br>
ciently low. This can be, for instance, water taken from a<br>
river or other body of water in the vicinity of the power<br>
station. The surrounding area is thus a heat sink compared to<br>
the components requiring cooling so that cooling water which<br>
is kept in said heat sink and routed to the components being<br>
cooled is highly suitable for cooling purposes without the<br>
need for further measures for, for example, lowering the tem-<br>
perature of the cooling water. It is here that a major advan-<br>
tage of the invention can also be found, because in known de-<br>
vices for refrigeration provisioning on a decentralized basis<br>
the problem often arises of providing a suitable cooling me-<br>
dium which is capable of absorbing sufficient energy in cool-<br>
ing the components being cooled.<br>
A further advantage of the invention is that absorption-type<br>
refrigeration machines are based on a robust and durable<br>
technology requiring at most the use of liquid circulating<br>
pumps and not involving any gas compression as in the known<br>
compression-type refrigeration machines. Absorption-type re-<br>
frigeration machines therefore have virtually no moving parts<br>
in their major components and consequently have low mainte-<br>
nance requirements.<br>
Absorption-type refrigeration machines furthermore require<br>
very little electrical energy themselves.<br>
In an advantageous embodiment of the invention at least part<br>
of the steam taken from the steam turbine can be routed to a<br>
heat exchanger for heating a heating medium, preferably hot<br>
water.<br>
In this embodiment of the invention the power station has<br>
been expanded in such a way as to provide heat generation<br>
alongside refrigeration generation, with steam taken from the<br>
steam turbine now' being used to operate a heat exchanger, by<br>
means of which thermal energy is routed to consumers of heat,<br>
as well as the absorption-type refrigeration machine. Exam-<br>
ples of said consumers of heat include heating devices, for,<br>
say, buildings, that are operated by means of a flow of hot<br>
water. The thermal energy needed to heat the flow of hot wa-<br>
ter is taken by means of heat exchange from the steam taken<br>
from the steam turbine.<br>
Combined heat, power and refrigeration generation for the<br>
central provisioning of consumers with electrical energy, re-<br><br>
frigeration and heat has clearly been implemented in this em-<br>
bodiment of the invention.<br>
The expeller of the absorption-type machine can be operated<br>
directly using the extracted steam or indirectly by means of<br>
heat exchange using an expeller-heating medium, for example<br>
water. The extracted steam can also be routed to an air-<br>
conditioning system, with said system having a changeover de-<br>
vice by means of which the extracted steam can be routed op-<br>
tionally to the expeller of the absorption-type refrigeration<br>
machine (for example for generating refrigeration in the sum-<br>
mer for cooling purposes) or to the heat exchanger (for exam-<br>
ple for generating heat in the winter for heating purposes);<br>
the absorption-type refrigeration machine and/or heat ex-<br>
changer are here included in the air-conditioning system.<br>
In a further advantageous embodiment of the invention the<br>
power station furthermore includes at least one gas turbine<br>
whose waste heat is used for generating operating steam for<br>
the steam turbine, with its being possible for the absorp-<br>
tion-type refrigeration machine to be used, additionally or<br>
alternatively to refrigerating other consumers of refrigera-<br>
tion, for refrigerating intake air of the gas turbine.<br>
This embodiment of the invention is what is termed a gas-and-<br>
steam system which includes the absorption-type refrigeration<br>
machine for generating refrigeration.<br>
When the gas turbine is operated, air is taken in which ad-<br>
vantageously has to undergo cooling in order to enhance per-<br>
formance. In the present embodiment of the invention the ab-<br>
sorption-type refrigeration machine's refrigeration genera-<br>
tion is provided at least partially and/or temporarily for<br>
said cooling of the intake air, namely especially in cases of<br>
the power station's operation in which consumers requiring<br>
cooling that are linked to the absorption-type machine do not<br>
use up the absorption-type refrigeration machine's full re-<br>
frigeration potential so that, consequently, surplus refrig-<br>
eration is available which is then used for cooling the gas-<br>
turbine intake air.<br>
The performance of the gas turbine is enhanced thereby.<br>
Variations in the quantity of refrigeration taken are also<br>
reduced thereby so as, in particular, to ensure that the ab-<br>
sorption-type refrigeration machine operates evenly.<br>
The proposed invention is suitable in all its embodiments<br>
for, for example, air-conditioning residential areas, large<br>
apartment blocks, office buildings, industrial parks, hotels,<br>
hospitals, public facilities etc. Preferred application sites<br>
for the invention can be, in particular, the earth's hotter<br>
climatic zones subject to such high ambient temperatures as<br>
to make air-conditioning necessary and/or desirable.<br>
Further possible application sites include, for example, va-<br>
cation centers in tropical and subtropical regions.<br>
An exemplary embodiment of the invention is presented in more<br>
detail below with reference to the drawing, in which:<br>
FIG 1 shows a power station according to the invention<br>
embodied as a gas-and-steam system, and<br>
FIG 2 shows a power station according to the invention<br>
having a gas turbine.<br>
The figure is a schematic of a power station 1 according to<br>
the invention which is embodied as a gas-and-steam system and<br>
includes a steam turbine 5 and a gas turbine 30.<br>
The operating steam B of the steam turbine 5 is made avail-<br>
able by means of the waste heat A of the gas turbine 30.<br>
The steam turbine 5 includes a high-pressure section 7 and a<br>
low-pressure section 9.<br>
An absorption-type refrigeration machine 10 is operated by<br>
means of extracted steam 12 used as a heat source. Said ex-<br>
tracted steam 12 is routed to an expeller 14 of the absorp-<br>
tion-type refrigeration machine 10, said expeller sustaining<br>
the absorption process of the absorption-type refrigeration<br>
machine 10. The output of the expeller 14 is linked via a<br>
pump 41 to a heating surface 38 which is heated by the waste<br>
heat A of the gas turbine 30 in order to generate the operat-<br>
ing steam B necessary for operating the steam turbine 5. The<br>
exhaust gas of the gas turbine 30 is routed after heat ex-<br>
change with the heating surface 38 to a cooling tower 36.<br>
In the example shown the absorption-type refrigeration ma-<br>
chine 10 operates with a cycle for a lithium bromide solution<br>
which is circulated and thereby heated by the extracted steam<br>
for feeding out liquid water in the expeller 14 and is then<br>
re-cooled in a water vapor extractor 16 for the absorption of<br>
water vapor. The water vapor extractor 16 is thus a component<br>
requiring cooling and is supplied with cooling water K which<br>
is used, for example, in parallel for cooling a condenser 15<br>
of the steam turbine 5 and is taken from, for instance, a<br>
cooling tower 25.<br>
The high-pressure section 7 and low-pressure section 9 of the<br>
steam turbine 5 are mutually connected in the present exem-<br>
plary embodiment via a heating surface 39 for intermediate<br>
overheating of the partially expanded steam, for example.<br>
The steam turbine 5 and gas turbine 30 are each coupled to a<br>
generator G for generating electrical energy. Refrigeration<br>
is generated by means of the absorption-type refrigeration<br>
machine 10 by means of a vaporizer 13 which is under very low<br>
pressure, in particular pressure close to a vacuum. Water re-<br>
quiring to be vaporized by means of the vaporizer 13 will<br>
consequently be vaporized at a very low temperature, for ex-<br>
ample 4°C. The resulting steam is extracted from the vapor-<br>
izer 13 by means of the water vapor extractor 16. Water<br>
ducted through the vaporizer 13 will as a consequence of the<br>
practically constant low temperature in said vaporizer be<br>
cooled to a value approximating said low temperature so that<br>
a stream 45 of lead-in cooling water for cooling consumers 32<br>
of refrigeration is generated with a low constant tempera-<br>
ture.<br>
In the present embodiment of the invention the absorption-<br>
type refrigeration machine 10 is furthermore used to operate<br>
a cooling surface 34 by means of the stream of lead-in cool-<br>
ing water so that intake air L for the gas turbine 30 is<br>
cooled. This enhances the performance of the gas turbine. By<br>
combining the two measures, namely provisioning of the con-<br>
sumers 32 of refrigeration and cooling of the intake air L,<br>
it is also possible to achieve a constant quantity of refrig-<br>
I eration taken from the absorption refrigeration of the ab-<br>
sorption-type refrigeration machine 10.<br>
The extracted steam 12 from the low-pressure section 9 of the<br>
steam turbine 5 is furthermore used to heat a heating medium<br>
28 by means of a heat exchanger 20 so that consumers 27 of<br>
heat can be supplied with thermal energy by means of the<br>
heating medium 28.<br>
The embodiment of the invention shown in Figure 1 hence im-<br>
plements combined heat, power and refrigeration generation<br>
suitable particularly for centrally provisioning a large num-<br>
ber of consumers with the cited types of energy.<br>
Similarly to the known long-distance thermal energy network<br>
associated with known combined heat and power generation, the<br>
invention further makes it possible to implement a long-<br>
distance refrigeration network for the central provisioning<br>
of refrigeration and hence to realize, for example, the air-<br>
conditioning of large building complexes having a substantial<br>
need for refrigeration.<br>
This is of particular interest in the earth's hotter climatic<br>
zones where there is a substantial need for refrigeration and<br>
air-conditioning. Using the invention will ensure provision-<br>
ing with electrical, thermal and refrigeration energy.<br>
Figure 2 shows a power station 50 according to the invention<br>
having a gas turbine 52 whose heat AH is routed to a waste-<br>
heat boiler AHK; the waste heat AH" leaving the waste-heat<br>
boiler AHK is here used for operating an absorption-type re-<br>
frigeration machine 100. The embodiment and further connec-<br>
tion of the waste heat boiler are not shown in greater detail<br>
here, nor are further specifics of the power station 50.<br>
