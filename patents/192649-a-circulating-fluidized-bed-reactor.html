				<td>The present invention relates to a circulating fluidized bed reactor comprising :<br>
-	a plurality of substantially vertical walls with cooling elements therein,<br>
said vertical walls including a rear wall, and defining an interior of a<br>
circulating fluidized bed reactor chamber;<br>
means for introducing fluidization gas at the bottom of said reactor chamber;<br>
-	means for introducing particulate material into said reactor chamber;<br>
a separator for separating particulate material from exhaust gases, said separator connected to an upper section of said reactor chamber; a return duct connected to said separator;<br>
-	a bubbling fluidized bed chamber, including a bubbling fluidized bed of<br>
particulate material, adjacent to said reactor chamber rear wall and including<br>
a heat exchanger for cooling particulate material, and including fluidizing<br>
means;<br>
-	means for introducing particulate material into the bubbling bed chamber<br>
at an upper section thereof;<br>
a discharge channel between said bubbling fluidized bed chamber and said reactor chamber for discharging material from the bubbling fluidized bed to said reactor chamber; and<br>
-	an opening in a lower section of said discharge channel for allowing<br>
particulate material to flow from a bottom section of the bubbling fluidized<br>
bed through said opening into said lower section of said discharge channel;<br><br><br>
US patent 5,060,599 shows a circulating fluidized bed reactor having pockets formed in the side wall thereof to receive material flowing downwardly along the wall. The pocket is provided with an upward opening at a location where the density of the fluidized bed is considerably lower than that adjacent to the reactor bottom. This document shows how to control the material flow by allowing the material to outflow over the edge of the pocket or by discharging material via a duct or opening in the bottom of the pocket. The pocket is formed inside the reactor by providing a partition wall in the reactor chamber. To have a sufficient volume for the pocket and heat transfers therein the<br><br><br>
partition wall must be considerably high. A heavy wall structure of this kind is very difficult as it causes stresses to other structures at its joining points and also undesirable vibration of structures. If the height of the partition wall is increased, the operation of such a pocket will be restricted to merely high load operations. At low loads, insufficient amounts of solid material will be falling into the pocket. Also, since the pocket may be emptied directly via the opening at its bottom, there must be some additional means for controlling the discharge of the material and for preventing any accidental discharge thereof.<br>
US 4,716,856 shows an integral fluidized bed heat exchanger in an energy producing plant. There is shown an integral fluidized bed heat exchanger and fluidized bed reactor having a common wall between them. The common wall is provided with openings for allowing the material from the fluidized bed heat exchanger to overflow into the reactor. As disclosed, there must be separate controlling facilities and z recycle leg for direcring the surplus laarerial separated from the gases directly back to the reactor. This arrangement has only one level from which the material overflows to the reactor. The gases and particles flow through the same opening.<br>
In US 4,896,717 there is shown a fluidized bed reactor in which a recycle heat exchanger is located adjacent to the furnace of the reactor with each enclosing a fluidized bed and sharing a common wall which includes a plurality of water tubes. In this document, the solids are also suggested to overflow back to the reactor. However, this document suggests to direct all separated material via the recycle heat exchanger back to the reactor. This results in that the capacity of the recycle heat exchanger must)such as to allow the material to flow even at a maximum load, which easily<br><br>
leads to an unnecessarily large and over-dimensioned construction with regard to the performance of the heat exchanger. Also, the fluidization gas of the recycle heat exchanger must be conveyed via the overflow opening and further downwardly in the passage to the reactor.<br>
US patents 5,069,170 and 5,069,171 show also integral recycle heat exchangers in connection with a circulating fluidized bed reactor. Those, however, apply several compartments in the external heat exchanger chamber to manipulate the solids flow. The initial principle of introducing solid material from the bed to the reactor is also an overflow of material. These solutions are somewhat complicated.<br>
In EP publication 0 550 932 there is shown a system for cooling hot particulate material from a fluidized bed reactor having three distinct fluidized beds in an external, separate fluidized bed cooler. The material entrained with the gases is separated from the exhaust gases and is directed to a first fluidized bed from which the material is facultatively directed either to a second fluidized bed or a discharge duct. The second and a third fluidized bed cooler are located adjacently, below the first fluidized bed being divided by a common wall and communicating with their lower and upper sections. There is a gas space above the second and the third fluidized bed coolers and below the first fluidized bed to collect and pass the gas and solids to the common discharge duct connecting the fluidized bed cooler with the reactor. In this arrangement, it is difficult to efficiently control the flow of solids due to the general layout. It is also highly potential that a short circuit of hot solids is formed, i.e., solids flow easily uncooled from the first fluidized bed directly to the discharge duct.<br><br>
us patent 4,363,292 discloses an arrangement for providing heat transfer sections on the bottom grid of a fluidized bed reactor. In this system, there are also partition walls above the grid which divide the bottom section of the reactor into several sections. This arrangement has also a limited capability to provide sufficiently of heat transfer surface in the heat transfer section, particularly for low load conditions. This and other known methods of operating a fluidized bed reactor still have shortcomings which the present invention aims to abfelish.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a circulating fluidized bed with an integrated compact heat exchanger, which solves the problems of the prior art.<br>
It is a further object of the present invention to provide a circulating fluidized bed with an integrated compact heat exchanger, which efficiently complies with the demands on the heat exchange rate.<br>
It is still a further object of the present invention to provide a wall structure partitioning the integrated compact heat exchanger and the circulating fluidized bed reactor.<br>
It is still a further object of the present invention to provide a wall structure partitioning the integrated compact heat exchanger and the circulating fluidized bed reactor, which may be utilized as a part of a particulate material discharge Channel.<br>
It  is  still  a  further object  of  the  present invention to provide a compact fluidized bed heat exchanger, which has a high mixing rate of particulate material and a reliable material circulation/return system.<br><br>
It is still a further object of the present invention to provide a compact fluidized bed heat exchanger, which has a self adjusting bed level control.<br>
It is also an object of the present invention to provide a compact fluidized bed heat exchanger which has an efficiently supported partition wall with a main reactor.<br>
For meeting these and other objects of the invention, the circulating fluidized bed reactor of the present invention according to its first aspect is characterized by a discharge channel, between said bubbling fluidized bed chamber and said reactor chamber, which is substantially solids-tight and has an opening in an upper section thereof for allowing particulate material, which is to be discharged from the bubbling fluidized bed to the reactor chamber, to be discharged from said upper section of said discharge channel into said reactor chamber.<br>
The method of operating a circulating fluidized bed reactor, having a bubbling fluidized bed chamber, with a heat exchanger therein, disposed adjacent to the reactor chamber and a discharge channel arranged between the bubbling fluidized bed chamber and the reactor chamber, is according to the present invention characterized by discharging cooled particulate material from the bubbling fluidized bed at a lower section thereof into the lower section of the discharge channel, fluidizing the discharged particulate material in the discharge channel and introducing the discharged particulate material from the upper section of the discharge channel into the reactor chamber;<br>
The discharge channel being substantially solids-tight prevents transfer of particulate material through its walls, i.e. prevents mixing of cooled particulate material flowing upward internally in the discharge channel with hot particulate material being introduced into the bubbling<br><br>
fluidized bed chamber externally of the discharge channel. The discharge channel according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention allows transfer of particulate material upward within the channel from an opening connected to the bottom section of the bubbling fluidized bed into an opening directly connected to the reactor chamber.<br>
Preferably the particulate material in said discharge channel is fluidized so that it is in a flowable form and readily controllable. There may be independently controllable fluidization gas introduction means for both the discharge channel and the bubbling fluidized bed. The particulate material is directed from above the bubbling fluidized bed to its reactor side half, i.e. it is directed to a point close to the reactor chamber wall. The introduced particulate material may be hot solids directly from the fluidized bed in the reactor chamber or from the separator which separates solids from the reactor exhaust gases.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the lower opening of the discharge channel is located vertically below the' upper portion of the heat exchanger and the upper opening of the discharge channel is above the lower portion of the heat exchanger, so that at least a portion of- the heat exchanger is immersed in the bubbling fluidized bed. The discharge channel consist preferably of several distinct, individual small channels for creating the required cross-sectional area and a robust cooled structure. The cross section of an individual channel is preferably rectangular. Naturally the channels may be formed differently. The discharge channel or the several channels are preferably so dimensioned as to have a total cross sectional area 
According to _another aspect of the present invention, the circulating fluidized bed reactor with<br><br>
substantially vertical walls with cooling elements therein, the vertical walls defining the interior of the reactor chamber, includes means for introducing fluidization gas at the bottom of the fluidized bed reactor; means for introducing particulate material including fuel into said reactor; separator for separating particulate material from the gases, said separator being in connection with said reactor at the upper section thereof; bubbling fluidized bed provided with a heat exchanger for cooling particulate material, said bubbling fluidized bed having side walls and a rear wall- having cooling elements in fluid communication with the cooling elements of the reactor, a front wall structure partitioning the bubbling fluidized bed and the circulating fluidized bed from each other, the front wall consisting essentially of substantially vertical tubes being formed in a manner to provide at least one discharge channel within said wall structure including at leasr one substantially vertical solid tight portion, i.e, a portion substantially disabling penetration of particulate material through it, for transferring particulate material, said discharge channel being capable of discharging solids from the lower section of said bubbling fluidized bed and introducing the same into the circulating fluidized bed. Advantageously the discharge channel comprises an opening from the lower section of the discharge channel to the lower section of said bubbling fluidized bed, i.e, a lower opening, and an opening from the upper section of the discharge channel to the reactor, i.e, an upper opening. Also it is preferred to arrange the lower opening below the upper portion of the heat exchanger, and the upper opening is above the lower portion of the heat exchanger to ensure that at least a portion of the heat exchanger is immersed in the bubbling bed. The discharge channel is preferably formed in the wall by bending the tubes away from the discharge channel<br><br>
area and turning them behind the tube adjacent to or outside said area.<br>
A method of operating a circulating fluidized bed reactor is provided according to the present invention, in connection with a circulating fluidized bed reactor having substantially vertical walls with cooling elements therein, said vertical walls defining the interior of the reactor chamber; means for introducing fluidization gas at the bottom of the fluidized bed reactor; means for introducing particulate material into said reactor; separator for separating particulate material from gases, said separator bemg m connection with said reactor at the upper section<br><br>

Advantageously the upper surface of the bubbling<br><br>
fluidized bed is maintained at least on the same vertical level as the particulate material is introduced from the upper section of said discharge channel into the reactor.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS<br>
In Fig. 1, there is depicted a circulating fluidized bed reactor 10. The circulating fluidized bed reactor is formed of substantially vertical walls 12 with cooling elements therein. Conventionally the walls are made of adjacent parallel tubes connected to each other with fin or bar elements to form a gas tight structure. This is well known in the art and is therefore not explained here more in detail. The wails. 12 define the interior of the reacucr chamber 14. In the bottom section of the reactor there are means 16 for introducing fluidization gas, such as air, into the bottom of the fluidized bed reactor. Also means 18 for introducing particulate material into said reactor are provided. At the upper elevation, there are means for introducing secondary air 20, (that is at least when combustion of fuel is practised in the reactor). A separator 22 for separating particulate material from the gases is connected with said reactor at the upper section thereof by means of a duct 24. In some cases, the separator may also be . in a direct back-to-back relation with the reactor rear wall 12. Preferably the separator is a cyclone separator, which may be arranged either in a vertical or a horizontal position. A return duct 26 connects the particulate material outlet of separator 22 with the reactor to recirculate<br><br>
particulate material separated in the separator back to the circulating fluidized bed reactor chamber 14. In connection with the return duct 26, there is provided a bubbling fluidized bed chamber 28 adjacent to the reactor 14 provided with heat exchanger means 30 for cooling particulate material fluidized therein. The bubbling fluidized bed chamber 28 has side walls (not shown herein), and rear 32 and front 34 walls having cooling elements in fluid communication with the cooling elements of the reactor walls 12. The bubbling fluidized bed chamber 28 is connected with said return duct for receiving particulate material separated from the gases. The gases are discharged from the separator 22 via outlet 37 for further processing such as heat recovery.<br>
When operating as a combustor/steam generator, the circulating fluidized bed is formed in the chamber 14 in a conventional manner. A characteristic feature of the circulating fluidized bed is that particulate material is entrained with the gases flowing upwards in the chamber to such an extent that either new material must be introduced into the bed- or separation and recirculation of the entrained material must take place, the latter being a preferred manner of maintaining the circulating fluidized bed. Naturally any discharge or material escaping through the separator must be compensated by bringing new material into the circulation process.<br>
The separated particulate material is conveyed from<br>
the lower part of the return duct 26 via a gas lock 36 into<br>
the chamber 28. Particulate material is preferably introduced<br>
into the chamber 2 8 from above the surface of the bubbling<br>
bed therein and 'to the reactor side half of the bubbling bed<br>
from the gas  lock 36.  As the particulate material  is<br>
introduced relatively near the common wall 12 between the<br>
reaction and the chamber 28, which is advantageous when aiming<br><br>
at a compact structure, the bubbling fluidized bed chamber is constructed to operate in connection with such an arrangement advantageously as described below with reference to Fig.2.<br>
The front wall section 34 partitioning the reactor 14 and the bubbling bed chamber 2 8 includes a discharge channel 38, which is formed by inner 40 and outer sections of the wall 34. The discharge channel 38 is formed in a manner which substantially prevents the movement of particulate material in the bubbling fluidized bed through it. However, it may allow passage of gas at least to some extent. The discharge channel is provided with an opening section 4 2 at its upper section to allow communication between the discharge channel and the reactor"' 14. The discharge channel is also provided with an opening section 44 to allow communication between the discharge channel and the bubbling fluidized bed chamber 28, the opening 44 being located at the lower portion of the discharge channel.<br>
In normal operation of the circulating fluidized bed reactor, hot particulate material is separated from the exhaust gases. At least part of the separated particulate material is introduced from the return duct 26 to the bubbling fluidized bed chamber 28 at its reactor side half. And, since the opening section 4 2 is located near the introduction area of the particulate material, i.e., reactor side half of the chamber 28, the inner wall section 40 is according to the invention formed to disable movement of particulate material through it to prevent a "direct flow of material to the outlet opening section 42, i.e., preventing formation of a short circuit. In this manner, the particulate material advantageously introduced into the 'bubbling fluidized bed chamber 28 at its reactor side half, above the bed surface, is forced to mix efficiently while being fluidized by means 46. The particulate material cooled by<br><br>
heat exchanger 30 is discharged via opening section 44 in order to ensure efficient operation. The particulate material is discharged at the opposite side of the bed compared with where it is introduced. The discharged material is fluidized in the discharge channel 38 by introducing independently controllable fluidization gas by means 48. The fluidization gas may^£ conveyed into the reac5tor~'14 via opening sections 50 and/or 52. The heat exchanger may be, for example, a superheater of steam formed in the cooling elements of the reactor, i.e., an evaporating tube wall. It is also possible to arrange intermediate steam reheat surfaces in such a bubbling fluidized bed.<br>
An advantageous aspect of the present invention is that the bubbling fluidized bed chamber 28 and its heat exchanger may be designed for a certain performance, without a need of being capable of processing all the particulate material separated by the separator 22. In certain operating circumstances or in case the bubbling fluidized bed chamber and the heat exchanger are designed for a heat transfer load, which is considerably smaller than obtained within the medium capacity of the introduced solids, the present invention enables the equipment size (capacity) to be designed in a sophisticated manner to the required dimensions. In operation, the fluidization means 48, 46 are controlled, e.g., according to a required heat output of the heat exchanger. This fluidization controls the discharge of the particulate material via the discharge channel 3 8 and thus the heat output of the heat exchanger 30. If the amount of introduced material from, e.g., gas lock 36 (material may also be conveyed directly from the reactor 14 via opening section 50 and/or 52, which is explained later) is greater than that needed for gaining the required heat output from heat exchanger 30, the bed level 54 is allowed to rise up to the level of edge 56 of the opening section 50. This means<br><br>
that all surplus of hot particulate material not required for gaining the desired heat output of the heat exchanger 30 is allowed to flow directly and uncooled into the reactor 14. In such a condition the particulate tread of the surplus of particles is merely "surface circulation" without any substantial mixing of material. This sophisticated arrangement concerns maintaining the required circulating bed inventory in the reactor 14 without a need to ineffectively design the bubbling fluidized bed 28 to be able to process all material needed for the circulating fluidized bed, even if the heat output of the heat exchanger 30 would not require that. The above-mentioned solution results, e.g., in a smaller (more compact) size of the bubbling fluidized bed and the discharge channel since there is no need to dimension the bubbling fluidized bed and related equipment for full load operation of the circulating fluidized bed reactor when the particle circulation is at its maximum. Moreover, in order to avoid the impact of an upward flow of fluidization gas from the bubbling bed chamber into the reactor and of a downward flow of particulate material fed into the bubbling bed chamber, it is advantageous to arrange opening sections respectively in horizontally spaced relations.<br>
In Fig. 3, there is shown an arrangement to process (e.g. cool) particulate material of a circulating fluidized bed reactor 14 in a direct coimnunication with the circulating fluidized bed. The material is fed directly from the reactor' 14 via an opening section 58.-Jn,<br>
Figs. 1 and 2 this feature is possible to combine with the feeding of material from the separator 22. The bubbling fluidized bed 28 is arranged at the lower section of the circulating fluidized bed reactor 14 and they have a common wall 34. The lower section is only shown in Fig. 3, but it should be understood that the whole reactor 14 may be, e.g., as shown in Fig. 1. There may also be several distinct<br><br>
bubbling fluidized beds 28 at different vertical elevations and sides of the reactor 14. This is advantageous due to the fact that the bubbling fluidized bed is preferably designed only for particulate handling capacity required by desired heat output of the heat exchanger 30. And, due to the nature of circulating fluidized bed, it is possible to select the rate of introduction of particulate material into each bubbling fluidized bed, e.g., by positioning each at such vertical elevation which provides a rate of material introduction which corresponds with the desired heat output of the heat exchanger at respective load of the circulating fluidized bed reactor. This is possible because the entrainment of particulate material in the circulating fluidized bed is a function of the load of the reactor.<br>
In operation of the circulating  fluidized bed reactor as illustrated in Fig. 3, there is utilized the fact that even at low loads of the circulating fluidized bed there is available particulate material flowing into the bubbling fluidized bed 23 at the lower section of the reactor<br>
chamer 14'.  Particulate  material  is  flowing  into  the  bubbling<br>
fluidized bed chamber 28 via opening 58. The material is<br>
mostly introduced into the reactor side half of the bubbling<br>
bed chamber. In order to prevent short circuit, the inner<br>
wall section 40 is according to the invention formed to<br>
disable movement of particulate material through it to<br>
prevent direct flow of material to the outlet opening section<br>
42 of the discharge channel. In this manner, the particulate<br>
material introduced into the bubbling fluidized bed chamber<br>
28 mostly at its reactor side half, above the bed surface, is<br>
forced to mix efficiently while being fluidized by means 46.<br>
Particulate  material  cooled  by  heat  exchanger  30  is<br>
discharged via the opening section 44 in order to ensure<br>
efficient operation. Particulate material is discharged at<br>
the opposite side of the bed compared to where it is<br><br>
introduced. The discharged material is fluidized in the discharge channel 38 by introducing independently controllable fluidization gas by means 48. The fluidization gas may by discharged into the reactor 14 via opening sections 58.<br>
The partition wall 34 is preferably formed so as to be integrated with the flow circuitry of the walls of the reactor(TET, meaning that, m the most preferred embodiment, the wall 34 is formed by arranging the tubes, fins and lining of the wall 34 of the circulating fluidized bed reactor adjacent to the bubbling fluidized bed in such manner that the discharge channel is formed in connection with the wall 34. Since in operating conditions, there are various factors causing stress to the wall structure, the wall 34 is arranged to be durable against, e.g., vibrations by being constructed as an integrated member of the reactor 14. This feature also eliminates all undesired thermal expansion differences between the reactor 14 and the bubbling fluidized bed chamber 28. In Fig. '4, there is illustrated a preferred embodiment, or the wall 34 partitioning the circulating fluidized bed 14 and the bubbling fluidized bed chamber 28. The wall includes a plurality of tubes 60 forming a part of the cooling system of the reacrnr^l4. Typically the cooling system is a steam generation system. The tubes 60 are connected to each other, e.g., by fins or bars 62 between the tubes to form a substantially gas tight wall structure. At a certain spacing the tubes are bent away from general plain "G" so that there are formed areas or widths "A" free of tubes.. According to the invention it is possible to arrange in such an area the discharge channel(s) 38 by forming inner 40 and outer wall sections so that direct flowing of particulate material is prevented through the area or width A free of tubes. The area or width "A" is typically 0 
 <br>
of suitable lining material which endures the circumstances in the reactor such as refractory castable coating. In Fig. 4, the illustration is a view of Fig. 3, i.e., the wall at a location where the discharge channel is a substantially closed channel. As can bee seen, the discharge channel preferably has a rectangular cross section. Naturally it could be also designed differently.<br>
Figures 5 and 6 show that the openings 42 and 44 may<br>
be established simply by arranging an opening in the lining material of the discharge channel. Fig. 7 shows another possibility of bending the tube from plain "G" to both sides leaving areas "A" free of tubes for the discharge channel 38. Naturally, there are various possibilities to arrange the tubing at wall section 34, also so that there are tubes inside the wall section 40 to stiffen it. E.g, by bending the tubes appropriately, it is possible to obtain also lateral movement of solids when they are being transported by the discharge channel.<br>
The present invention may be applied to different processes in connection with circulating fluidized bed reactors, such as for cooling or generally for treating of gas by using a circulating fluidized bed reactor. Also, e.g., combustion and gasification processes at pressures above atmospheric may be considered to be run with the system disclosed herein, in which case the reactor should be enclosed by a pressure vessel.<br>
While various embodiments of the invention and suggested modifications thereto have been described, it should be understood that modifications could be made in the structure and arrangement of the described embodiments without departing from the scope of the invention which is more defined in the following claims.<br><br><br>
