This  invention  relates  to  a  process  for  manufacturing  green tea.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Green tea is made from green leaf, which is also used in making black tea. The main difference in processing of green and black tea is the prevention of withering and fermentation in the form by initial heat inactivation of the polyphenol oxidase enzyme present in tea flush.. This inactivation is achieved by steaming the flush to a temperature of l00OC as well as by a process known as panning where the flush is fed into hot rotating drum touching a temperature of 300-350oC.<br>
The steps involved in steaming process of green tea manufacture are sorting and cleaning the fresh green leaves and subjecting the same to the steps of steaming, primary rolling and drying, rolling, secondary drying, final rolling followed by final drying and refining to obtain the green tea.<br>
In the panning process of green tea manufactureed, the steps followed are similar to those for the steaming process, except that the initial inactivation is effected by dry heat. The fresh green leaf is sorted and cleaned and subjected to the step of panning, primary rolling and drying, rolling, secondary drying, final rolling and final drying followed by refining.<br><br>
3.<br>
The entire exclusion of withering and fermentaion stages necessary to the manufacture of black tea, renders the whole process of green tea manufacture a simple one in comparison with that of black tea. A1though variation in weather conditions exercise little effect on manufacture, green tea making requires as much, if not more, care and supervision than that does black tea manufacture.<br>
An improved process for making green tea involving microwave technology to replace the conventional steps of steaming and panning, is known in the art. This process involves the steps of subjecting the sorted and cleaned fresh green leaf to the steps of microwave heating, cooling, dehydration, rolling, drying and refining to obtain the green tea.<br>
Thus, in all the processes mentioned hereinbefore, the tea leaves are subjected to steaming, panning or microwave heating to inactivate the enzymes for preventing oxidative changes and to retain catechins substantially unchanged during processing. It is known that the flavor of green tea is related to the intensity of astringency , bitterness, brothy taste and sweetness Caffeine contributes to the bitterness of the tea brew through complexes with phenol. The astrigency of the tea brew is a result of polyphenols in tea, such as (-) epi catechin, (-) epi catechin gallate, (-) epi gallo catechin and (-) epi gallo catechin gallate. The brothy taste of tea brew originates in the amino acid fraction, expecially the 1-theanine. Sweetness is as a result of sugar and amino acids.<br><br>
4.<br>
The disadvantages associated with the use of steaming, panning and microwave treatment in the manufacture of green tea are longer duration of drying, lower turnover, poor sanitary conditions due to spillage of tea leaf component during processing and lack of quality in terras of aroma,<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is therefore an object of this invention to propose a process<br>
for the manufacture of green tea which is cost effective and<br>
efficient by involving reduced processing time.<br>
It is a further object of this invention to propose a process<br>
for the manufacture of green tea with improved quality.<br>
Other objects and advantages of this invention will be apparent<br>
from the ensuing description.<br>
At  the outset  of the description which follows,  it is to be<br>
understood  that  the  ensuing  description  only  illustrates  a<br>
particular form of this invention. However,  such a particular<br>
form is only an exemplary embodiment without intending to imply<br>
any limitation on the scope of the invention. Accordingly the<br>
description  is  to  be  understood  as an  exemplary   embodiment<br>
and reading of the invention is not to be taken restrictively.<br><br>
5. DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Yhus according to the invention is provided a process for the manufacture of green tea.<br>
In accordance with this invention, the harvested green leaves are subjected to the step of freezing, dehydration followed by primary rolling and secondary rolling and, finally the steps of drying,cooling, drying and cleaning to obtain the tea leaves which are finally graded and winnowed before packing In the process of the instant invention, green leaf harvest containing 65-75% of two leaf and a bud as in case of rain crop with dry matter content ranging from 18% to 26% is used for making green tea. The green tea leaf is frozen which facilitates crystallization of intro-and extra-cellular moisture in leaf causing maximum cell damage during dehydration rollign and drying process. The total processing time is reduced during dehydration and drying as a result of faster rate of moisture evaporation due to maximum cell damage caused to the leaf.<br>
The steps of freezing and dehydration help in simultaneous inactivation of enzymes and removal of moisture which weather the leaf to a satisfactory rollable condition. The biochemical changes desirable in green tea are achieved during primary rolling, roll breaing-cum-sitting and secondary rolling. The leaf after primary rolling and first stage drying is subjected to roll breaking-cum sifting to effect separation of fines from bulk and the bulk and fines are separately handled during second and third stage of drying to minimize loss in dry matter.<br><br>
6.<br>
Cooling of processed leaf after second stage of drying helps in equilibrating moisture in leaf particle by internal diffusion process  thereby  facilitating  removal of moisture during final<br>
drying.<br>
The  banji  and  coarse  leaves are  processed to make green tea<br>
with improved leaf colour, bright yellow liquor and adequate aroma in infusion and cup.<br>
The invention will now be more explained in greater detail with the help of the following non-limiting example.<br>
EXAMPLE<br>
Results of a pilot scale trial for making green tea using 10 kg leaf of July crop by the new process as well as by steam treatment process are given below:<br><br><br>
7.<br>
