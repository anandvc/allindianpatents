SPECIFICATION AND MANNER OF PERFORMANCE OF THE SAID PROCESS:<br>
This invention in general relates to sugar manufacturing technology and in particular this invention relates to a novel process for manufacturing sugar from sugar cane.<br>
In the process known in the art of manufacturing there are two kinds of technologies. First Process is known as sulphitation and other is known as carbonation. The sulphitation process is viable commercial proposition and hence most of the sugar manufacturing industries adopt sulphitation process <br>
The existing predominant process for clarification of cane, juice in Sugar Industry in India is by treating the Hot Raw Juice (60-70° C) with simultaneous liming and sulphitation so as to obtain the treated juice to a pH of around 7.0 to 7.1. This is heated further to 102° C and subjected for settling with clarifier so as to obtain clear juice for further processing. The International Commission for Uniform Methods of Sugar Analysis (ICUMSA) colour value of clear juice is normally around 2000-3000. This clear juice offer hard scale in the evaporators. The resultant sugar colour in terms of International Commission for Uniform Methods of Sugar Analysis (ICUMSA) value is around 130-150.<br>
As per the Indian patent specification No.29461 dt.5.4.1943, the cane juice is treated with lime and mixture containing ash (residue obtained after the extraction of sulphur from beluchistan sulphur ore) and phosphate containing 35-40% available phosphoric acid. This system is not being followed now in the Industry. As specified in the patent No.29461, the possible sugar colour that can be obtained is below 25 ISS (Indian Sugar Standard) and for improving the colour, again, supplication is recommended. But the present colour value described by Govt, of India is in the series of 30 and31. So the above process is limited to produce sugar quahty of 25 ISS (Indian Sugar Standard) only.<br>
This novel invention is to provide a process for manufacturing sugar of best quahty features and which earns additional revenue.<br>
Therefore the primary object of the invention is to invent a process for clarification of cane juice by treating juice with lime and neutralizing with phosphoric acid.<br><br>
It is another object of the invention to invent a process for clarification of cane juice wherein the viscosity of the sugar juice is optimally maintained such that the crystallisation is at a faster phase than in the conventional process of Sulphitation.<br>
It is another object of the invention to invent a process of clarification of cane juice wherein presence of inorgonic elements in the clear juice is kept minimum.<br>
It is another object of the invention to invent a process wherein sugar of best quality of 50-70 International Commission for Uniform Methods of Sugar Analysis (ICUMSA) colour can be obtained.<br>
Further object of the invention will be apparent from the ensuing description.<br>
A process of manufacturing sugar comprising the steps of<br>
Heating the raw juice of around 5.0 pH at 65 to 70° C and liming the raw juice contineouly in a separate vessel by which the pH of the raw juice is maintained between 8.8 to 9.2.<br>
Adding phosphoric acid to the raw juice lime mixture, in a next vessel so as to maintain a pH at around 7.0.<br>
Then after, the juice is heated to around 102° C<br>
Subjecting the resultant alongwith around 2ppm of Magnofloc/floculant in a clarifier so as to obtain brilliant, transparent clear juice and mud separately.<br>
Evaporating the clear juice in an evporator to obtain srup<br>
Adding hydrogen peroxide at the rate of 10 ppm to syrup and<br>
Processing the syrup in the manner known in the art of crystallisation in order to obtain sugar colour of 50-70 International Commission for Uniform Methods of Sugar Analysis (ICUMSA).<br>
Now the invention will be described with reference to accompanying drawings wherein fig.l shows in block diagram the conventional process of manufacturing sugar and fig.2 shows in block diagram the novel process of manufacturing cane sugar according to the invention.<br><br>
In the novel process Raw juice is heated to 60 - 70° C and treated with milk of hme to a pH 8.8 to 9.2 in a separate vessel. The retention time in the vessel shall be around 3-5 minutes. TTie treated juice shall be passed on to the next vessel, wherein phosphoric acid is added for neutralising the pH and the retention time shall be around 10 minutes. Thus the treated neutral juice obtained shall be heated to around 102° C and further processed as in the manner known in the art by adding around 2ppm flocculant, so as to get a brilliant clear juice with compact mud from clarifier. Maximum non-sugars are removed by way of mud.<br>
The clear juice obtained shall be of improved quality when compared with all other processes. The International Commission for Uniform Methods of Sugar Analysis (ICUMSA) colour value of CJ shall be 1000 to 1100. This clear juice is subjected for evaporation in the evaporators and to the resulted snip, hydrogen peroxide is added @ lOppm to further improve the quality of syrup. Further the syrup is processed in the same manner known in the art for crystallisation, so as to obtain sugar of 50-70<br>
In the conventional process liming and sulphitation takes place simultaneously, the quantity of addition of lime and sulphur is based on the criteria that pH value of the solution is maintained between 7.0 to 7.1. This results in inability of precisely estimating/required quantity of lime and sulphur dioxide for removal of Non-Sugars. The present invention overcome this problem of ascertaining the exact quantities of lime etc. This is achieved by adding lime and phosphoric acid in such a way that instead of adding them simultaneously, they are added in phases, by adding lime as &amp;st phase in the process and monitoring the pH value between 8.8 and 9.2 and then by adding phosphoric acid in the second stage of the process and maintaining the pH around 7.0.<br>
In the conventional process after subjecting the clear juice in the evaporators the resultant product is sulphited maintaining the pH at around 5.0. In the conventional process sulphitation takes place in two stages. Hence the fmal syrup contains certain amount of sulphur and this sulphited syrup is sent for crystallisation to obtain cane sugar crystals. It is apparent certain amount of sulphur is present in the final sugar crystals. In the novel process the presence of sulphur in the sugar crystal is obviated. The novel process is sulphur free. This is one of the salient features of the invention. The resultant sugar crystals from the novel process shall have the least inorganic impurities compared with the sugar produced by convetional process.<br><br>
Advantages   of  this   process   over conventional sulphitation   are   as follows;<br>
(a)	Sulphur free brihant sugar is produced, where the quality is very much<br>
preferred in food and beverage industries<br>
«<br>
(b)	Removal of Non -sugars are on higer side. This facilitates for<br>
(i)      Elimination   of   maximum   Non-sugars   and   hence   Higher clarification efficiency and exhaustion.<br>
(ii)     Less Viscosity juice, leading to easy and speedy process.<br>
(Hi)    Compact Mud<br>
(iv)    Reduction in total Massecuite % cane and thereby steam % cane.<br>
(v)      Higher recovery and less process loss thereby increase in the profit.<br>
(vi)    Higher realiation value due to improved quality of sugar.<br>
(vii)   Minimum scale in the evaporators.<br>
(viii)  Reduced inversion and unknown losses.<br>
(The resulted syrup pH is on higher side compared with the syrup obtained from the sulphitation process. Hence reduced inversion and unknown losses occur during crystalisation process).<br>
(c)	The vaccum fiher mud shall have higher phosphatic manural value.<br>
(d)	In the conventional process the viscosity of the resulting syrup is more than that of present invention process. When the viscosity is more the process of crystalisation is delayed, thus the resulting sugar is heated for a longer duration. This results in higher energy consumption. In this novel invention by retaining the viscosity of the sugar syrup in a controlled range aforesaid problems are obviated.<br><br>
Salient Features of the process according to the invention are as follows:<br>
This process is better and remimerative, efficient clarification of cane juice by treating the juice with lime and then neutralising with phosphoric acid and further processing in the known manner.<br>
This Process has the dosage of lime to the juice of 60-70° C be around 0.11 to 0.13% on cane to around 8.8 to 9.2 pH. TTie retention / reaction time shall be around 3-5 minutes during the above reaction.<br>
TTiis process has the dosage of phosphoric acid at the rate of around 0.04 to 0.05% on cane for neutralising the juice. The retention / reaction time shall be around 10 minutes.<br>
It will be understood that the foregoing description is only illustrative of the present invention and it is not intended that the invention be limited thereto. Many other specific embodiments of the present invention will be apparent to one skilled in the art fi-om the foregoing disclosure. All substitution, alterations and modification of the present invention which come within the scope of the following claims are to which the present invention is readily susceptible without departing fi-om the spirit of the invention.<br><br><br>
