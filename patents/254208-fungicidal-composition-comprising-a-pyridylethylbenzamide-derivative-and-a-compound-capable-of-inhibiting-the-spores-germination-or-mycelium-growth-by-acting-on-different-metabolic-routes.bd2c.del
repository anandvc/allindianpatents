				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to novel fungicide compositions comprising a pyridylethylbenzamide derivative and a compound capable of inhibiting the spores germination or mycelium growth by acting on different metabolic routes. The present invention also relates to a method of combating or controlling phytopathogenic fungi by applying at a locus infested or liable to be infested such a composition.<br>
International patent application WO 01/11965 generically discloses numerous pyridylethylbenzamide derivatives. The possibility of combining one or more of these numerous pyridylethylbenzamide derivatives with known fungicidal products to develop a fungicidal activity is disclosed in general terms, without any specific example or biological data.<br>
It is always of high-interest in agriculture to use novel pesticidal mixtures showing a synergistic effect in order notably to avoid or to control the development of resistant strains to the active ingredients or to the mixtures of known active ingredients used by the farmer while minimising the doses of chemical products spread in the environment and reducing the cost of the treatment.<br>
We have now found some novel fungicidal compositions which possess the above mentioned characteristics.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention relates to a composition comprising : a) a pyridylethylbenzamide derivative of general formula (I)<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
in which:<br>
-	p is an integer equal to 1,2, 3 or 4;<br>
-	q is an integer equal to 1,2, 3,4 or 5;<br>
-	each substituent X is chosen, independently of the others, as being halogen, alkyl or haloalkyl;<br>
- each substituent Y is chosen, independently of the others, as being halogen, alkyl,<br>
alkenyl, alkynyl, haloalkyl, alkoxy, amino, phenoxy, alkylthio, dialkylamino, acyl,<br>
cyano, ester, hydroxy, aminoalkyl, benzyl, haloalkoxy, halosulphonyl, halothioalkyl,<br>
alkoxyalkenyi,   aikylsulphonamide,   nitro,   alkylsulphonyl,   phenylsulphonyl   or<br>
benzylsulphonyl;<br>
as to the N-oxides of 2-pyridine thereof;<br>
and<br>
b) a compound capable of inhibiting the spores germination or mycelium growth by<br>
acting on different metabolic routes;<br>
in a (a) / (b) weight ratio of from 0.01 to 20.<br>
In the context of the present invention :<br>
-	halogen means chlorine, bromine, iodine or fluorine;<br>
-	each of the alkyl or acyl radicals present in the molecule contains from 1 to<br>
10 carbon atoms, preferably from 1 to 7 carbon atoms, more preferably from 1 to<br>
5 carbon atoms, and may be linear or branched;<br>
-	each of the aJkenyl or alkynyl radicals present in the molecule contains from 2 to 10<br>
carbon atoms, preferably from 2 to 7 carbon atoms, more preferably from 2 to 5<br>
carbon atoms, and may be linear or branched.<br>
The composition according to the present invention provides a synergistic effect. This synergistic effect allows a reduction of the chemical substances spread into the environment and a reduction of the cost of the fungal treatment.<br>
In the context of the present invention, the term "synergistic effect" is defined by Colby according to the article entitled "Calculation of the synergistic and antagonistic responses of herbicide combinations" Weeds, (1967), 15, pages 20-22.<br>
The latter article mentions the formula:<br>
in which E represents the expected percentage of inhibition of the disease for the combination of the two fungicides at defined doses (for example equal to x and y respectively), x is the percentage of inhibition observed for the disease by the compound (I) at a defined dose (equal to x), y is the percentage of inhibition observed for the disease by the compound (II) at a defined dose (equal to y). When the percentage of inhibition observed for the combination is greater than E, there is a synergistic effect.<br>
The composition according to the present invention comprises a pyridylethylbenzamide derivative of general formula (I). Preferably, the present invention relates to a composition comprising a pyridylethylbenzamide derivative of general formula (I) in which the different characteristics may be chosen alone or in combination as being :<br>
-	as regards p, p is 2;<br>
-	as regards q, q is 1 or 2. More preferably, q is 2;<br>
-	as regards X, X is chosen, independently of the others, as being halogen or<br>
haloalkyl.   More preferably, X is chosen, independently of the others, as being a<br>
chlorine atom or a trifluoromethyl group;<br>
-	as regards Y, Y is chosen, independently of the others, as being halogen or<br>
haloalkyl.   More preferably, Y is chosen, independently of the others, as being a<br>
chlorine atom or a trifluoromethyl group;<br>
