The present invention relates to a novel process for the synthesis of prostaglandins<br>
and prostaglandin analogues. The present invention further relates to novel synthetic<br>
intermediates that can be used in the synthesis of prostaglandins and prostaglaaidin<br>
analogues.<br>
PGFU prostaglandins and prostaglandin analogues comprise a cyclopenryl ring<br>
carrying two hydroxyl groups in a cis configuration and two side chains in a trans<br>
configuration. The side chains may contain double bonds and a variety of substituents.<br>
They have a number of therapeutic uses, e.g. for the treatment of glaucoma and ocular<br>
hypertension or to induce and accelerate labour.<br>
A variety of methods of synthesising PGFa prostaglandins and prostaglandin<br>
analogues arc known and are disclosed in, e.g. Chem. Rev. (1993, vol. 93, pages 1 533-<br>
1564), WO 02/096868, WO 02/090324 and Chinese Journal of Medicinal Chemistry<br>
(1998, vol. 36, pages 213-217).<br>
The present inventors have sought to provide an alternative method of<br>
synthesising PGPa prostaglandins and prostaglandin analogues. Ideally the synthetic<br>
route will be generally applicable to a variety of prostaglandin compounds and will<br>
provide high yields.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for the preparation of<br>
prostaglandin compounds having the formula (I):<br>
