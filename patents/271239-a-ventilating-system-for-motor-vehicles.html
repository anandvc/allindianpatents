Description<br>
A VENTILATING SYSTEM FOR MOTOR VEHICLES<br>
Technical Field<br>
This invention relates to a ventilating system, especially<br>
for motor vehicles, that is to say, a system for conditioning the<br>
air and/or cooling engines in motor vehicles.<br>
These systems include a fan, usually of the axial type,<br>
designed to direct an air flow against a heat exchange device.<br>
Background Art<br>
As is known, fans used for this purpose comprise a casing,<br>
commonly known as shroud, shaped like a ring and externally<br>
defined by a cylindrical wall. The shroud has a plurality of<br>
radial arms that support an electric motor mounted at the centre<br>
of it. The motor output shaft is coaxial with the cylindrical<br>
wall. The free end of the motor shaft is integral with an impeller<br>
consisting of a plurality of vanes.<br>
A cable connects the motor to an electrical power source<br>
inside the vehicle.<br>
As is known, fans of this type are fixed to the inside face<br>
of a mounting wall, at an air opening in the mounting wall itself,<br>
the latter delimiting a closed space containing components that<br>
form part of the conditioning and/or cooling systems.<br>
This means that the impeller, relative to the radial arms of<br>
the fan shroud, faces the air opening towards the outside, whilst<br>
the electric motor faces the inside of the closed space. Thus, the<br>
power cable of the motor follows a path inside the vehicle to<br>
connect up to the respective power source.<br>
In practice, it has been found that this type of structure<br>
may lead to problems during installation, removal and maintenance<br>
of the axial fan on account of the confined spaces making work on<br>
the fan difficult and time-consuming.<br><br>

Disclosure of the Invention<br>
This invention has for an aim to propose a ventilating<br>
system, equipped with an axial fan, that is quick and easy to<br>
install and remove.<br>
This invention accordingly provides a ventilating system,<br>
equipped with an axial fan, comprising the characteristics<br>
described in one or more of the appended claims.<br>
Brief description of the drawings<br>
Further characteristics and advantages of the invention are<br>
more apparent in the detailed description below, with reference to<br>
a preferred, non-restricting, embodiment of an axial fan,<br>
illustrated in the accompanying drawings, in which:<br>
Figure 1 is a schematic side view, partly in cross section,<br>
of a part of a ventilating system equipped with an axial fan<br>
according to the present invention;<br>
Figure 2 is a perspective view of the axial fan of Figure 1;<br>
Figures 3 and 4 are scaled-up perspective views of a part of<br>
the axial fan of Figure 2;<br>
Figure 5 is a perspective view of a detail from figures 1 to<br>
4;<br>
Figure 6 is a lateral section view of a scaled-up detail<br>
from Figure 1.<br>
Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiments of the Invention<br>
With reference to Figures 1 and 2, the numeral 1 denotes in<br>
its entirety a ventilating system, especially for a motor vehicle,<br>
designed for example to be used for the vehicle's air conditioning<br>
system and/or to cool its engine.<br>
The system comprises an axial fan 2 mounted at an opening 3<br>
made in a mounting wall 4 delimiting the top of a space 5 for<br>
housing the components of the system 1.<br>
The fan 2 comprises a ring-shaped casing 6, whose axis is<br>
labelled X, which is externally defined by a cylindrical wall 7<br>
and which constitutes a shroud for directing an air flow. The<br>
ring-shaped casing 6 has, at the top of it, a flange 8 and is<br><br>
WO 2006/059204	PCT/EB2005/003590<br>
        3<br>
fitted in the opening 3 in such a way that it can be extracted and<br>
abuts with the lower edge of the flange 8 against the outside<br>
surface 9 of the wall 4.<br>
The ring-shaped casing 6 has a plurality of radial arms or<br>
spokes 10 for supporting a motor 11 whose output shaft, which is<br>
coaxial with the axis X, mounts at the free end of it inside the<br>
space 5, an impeller 12 comprising a plurality of vanes 13 causing<br>
the conditioning and/or cooling air to flow from the outside to<br>
the inside of the space 5.<br>
It should be noted that the impeller 12 might, if necesary,<br>
cause the air to flow from the inside to the outside of the space<br>
5.<br>
The electric motor 11 is connected to an electrical power<br>
source (not illustrated) through a power cable 14 which, starting<br>
from an electrical power socket 15 located on the top cover lla of<br>
the motor 11, outside the space 5, extends radially along a first<br>
path section above the spokes 10 and is held against them by a<br>
clip 16.<br>
The cable 14 then passes through a U-shaped slot, labelled<br>
17, in the flange 8 and runs along the cylindrical outside surface<br>
18 of the ring-shaped casing 6.<br>
Advantageously, the cable 14 is held in contact with the<br>
cylindrical surface 18 by fastening means labelled 19 in their<br>
entirety.<br>
Thus, the power cable 14 leading out of the socket 15 of the<br>
electric motor 11 passes through the fastening means 19 and either<br>
directly or indirectly reaches the electrical power source located<br>
inside the space 5, to which it can be connected through a<br>
connector 14a.<br>
The fastening means 19 comprise retaining means, labelled 20<br>
in their entirety, integral with the ring-shaped casing 6, and a<br>
locking device 21 for holding the cable 14 securely against the<br>
outside surface 18.<br>
The retaining means 20 consist of a pair of protrusions 22<br>
parallel to the axis X and integral with the cylindrical surface<br>
18 of the ring-shaped casing 6. The protrusions 22 are defined at<br>
the top by two surfaces 23 transversal to the axis X and, in a<br><br>
WO 2006/059204	PCT/IB2005/003590<br>
4<br>
direction parallel to the latter, have two longitudinal grooves 24<br>
facing the outside.<br>
The locking device 21, which is removably pressure fitted on<br>
the protrusions 22, forms, together with the latter, a passage 25<br>
for the power cable 14.<br>
More specifically, the locking device 21 comprises a bottom<br>
wall 26 and a pair of walls 27 and 28 parallel with each other and<br>
perpendicular to the bottom wall 26.<br>
The walls 01 and 28 have respective ribs 29. extending in a<br>
direction parallel with the axis X, and which are pressure fitted<br>
inside the grooves 24 of the protrusions 22, in such a way as to<br>
form radial locking means of the locking device 21.<br>
At a first end of it, the bottom wall 26 has a flexible<br>
portion 30 extending past the ends of the two walls 27 and 28.<br>
The portion 30 has, on the side of it facing the two ribs<br>
29, a pair of shoulders 31, extending transversally to the axis X<br>
and which abut against the transversal surfaces 23 of the<br>
protrusions 22, in such a way as to form axial locking means of<br>
the device 21 itself.<br>
It should be noticed that the flexible portion 30 of the<br>
locking device 21 faces the U-shaped slot 17 made in the flange 8.<br>
At a second end of it, the locking device 21 has an opening<br>
32 defining an outlet from the passage 25 though which the power<br>
cable 14 leads out of the ring-shaped casing 6 inside the space 5.<br>
In this regard, it should be noticed that, at the opening<br>
32, the wall 27 has a slot 33 designed to allow the cable 14 to be<br>
inserted and pulled out without having to remove the connector<br>
14a.<br>
To detach the locking device 21 from the fastening means 19<br>
it is sufficient to manually bend the flexible portion 30 in such<br>
a way as to release the shoulders 31 from the transversal surfaces<br>
23 of the protrusions 22 and slide the device 21 in an axial<br>
direction.<br>
The invention achieves the aforementioned aims because the<br>
locking device 21 makes it possible to fasten the power cable 14<br>
directly to the cylindrical outside surface 18 of the shroud, thus<br>
enabling the fan to be quickly and easily fitted to and removed<br><br>
WO 2006/059204	PCT/IB2005/003590<br>
5<br>
from the mounting wall 4 through the opening 3.<br>
Furthermore, there is practically no interference between<br>
the power cable 14 and the impeller 12 since the power cable is<br>
attached to the ring-shaped casing 6, which means that the power<br>
cable moves as one with the fan when the latter is moved from its<br>
position.<br><br>
