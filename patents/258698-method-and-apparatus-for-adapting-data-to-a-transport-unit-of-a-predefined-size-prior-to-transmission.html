Method and Apparatus for adapting data to a transport unit of<br>
a predefined size prior to transmission<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The invention relates to the fields of data transmission and<br>
data decoding and in particular to the area of error<br>
detection and correction.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
The detection and correction of errors that occur to<br>
transmitted data is a major issue in communications systems,<br>
both for wireless and fixed wire systems. In order to<br>
overcome the loss of data or the corruption of data due to<br>
errors that occur during the transmission, different types of<br>
error detection codes have been introduced that allow for the<br>
data to be encoded before transmission and once received for<br>
any detected errors to be corrected and the correct data<br>
recovered. Such error detection codes are convolutional<br>
codes, cyclic codes, block codes to name but a few.<br>
Not all of the different types of these codes have the same<br>
error detecting and error correcting capabilities. Some have<br>
weaker error detection capabilities than others, which means<br>
that a careful choice has to be done before using a<br>
particular code.<br>
In A. J. McAuley's "Weighted Sum Codes for Error Detection<br>
and their Comparison with Existing Codes", IEEE/ACM<br>
Transactions on Networking, vol. 2, No. 1, Feb. 1994, pp 16 -<br>
22, a new family of error detection codes, Weighted Sum<br>
Codes, is described which has very strong error detection<br>
capabilities over existing codes.<br><br>
2<br>
In P. Farkas "Comments on Weighted Sum Codes for error<br>
detection and their comparison with existing codes", IEEE/ACM<br>
Transactions on Networking, vol. 3, no. 2, 1995, pp 222-223<br>
and in P. Farkas et al., "Modified Generalised Weighted Sum<br>
Codes for error control" chapter in the textbook "Coding<br>
Communications and Broadcasting", pp. 62 - 72, Research<br>
Studies Press Ltd., England, Feb. 2000, further research and<br>
analysis of the advantages of this family of codes in<br>
detecting and correcting errors was performed.<br>
Furthermore, problems also occur due to corruption when data<br>
is be.i.ng transmitted over an air-interface, in the case of a<br>
wireless communications system, or e.g. in a fibre optic<br>
cable, in the case of a terrestrial communications system.<br>
The encoded data that is generated by the different error<br>
control codes does not easily match the fixed structure of<br>
the transporting units, like for example an ATM (Asynchronous<br>
Transfer Mode) cell or an IP (Internet Protocol) packet or a<br>
frame, and as the generated encoded data has to be shortened,<br>
this can cause further difficulties in detecting and<br>
correcting the data when errors occur. When errors occur<br>
systems have to waste bandwidth resources in retransmitting<br>
the erroneous data.<br>
One of the ways that this problem was solved, was by<br>
selecting a code whose parameters directly fulfil the<br>
predefined constraints of the transport block.<br>
Another approach, was to select a code with a longer codeword<br>
(n) and a higher number of information symbols (k) in a<br>
codeword and then shortening that code. Shortening is<br>
performed by not using a selected number of information<br>
symbols.<br>
However both have the drawback that the selected codes do not<br>
always have an optimal error detection/correction capability.<br><br>
3<br>
A need therefore exists for a technique to implement a<br>
solution that can provide both a detection/correction<br>
capability that can detect and correct multiple errors<br>
present in the received encoded data, as well as matching the<br>
encoded data to a predefined transport unit size prior to<br>
transmission.<br>
The present invention resolves the above mentioned problems.<br>
The proposed method and device are responsive both to<br>
multiple error detection/correction requirements as well as<br>
to match.i.ng the encoded data to a predefined transport unit<br>
s i 7, e .<br>
The .invention .is achieved by the teachings contained in the<br>
independent claims.<br>
Said method adapts data in a communications system to be<br>
transmitted from a sender to a receiver, to a transport unit<br>
of a predefined size comprising the steps of:<br>
-	representing said data as a combination of bits over a<br>
finite field, wherein said data comprises of an information<br>
part and a control part;<br>
-	adapting said represented data to fit said predefined size<br>
of said transport unit, by expressing both said information<br>
and control parts with bits, wherein said bits are less in<br>
number that said represented combination of bits and a number<br>
of removed bits is known to said receiver, said removed bits<br>
comprise of bits from both said information and control<br>
parts.<br>
Said apparatus located in a communications system, comprises<br>
means for employing the method according to claim 1.<br>
Further advantages can be seen in the dependent claims,<br>
whereby the incomplete symbols that are received comprise of<br>
both incomplete control symbols and incomplete information<br>
symbols. The transport unit can be a cell, a packet or a<br><br>
4<br>
frame, and the data can be encoded using an error control<br>
code, which can be a Weighted Sum code, a Modified<br>
Generalised Weighted Sum code, a Reed Solomon code, a Hamming<br>
code, or a Turbo Block code.<br>

Detailed description of the invention<br>
In practical applications of error control codes the<br>
parameters of such codes as codeword length, the number of<br>
information symbols contained have to be adapted to a<br>
predefined transport unit size, as in the case where the<br>
transport protocol has a fixed size block for payload and<br>
redundancy, as in the case of an ATM cell or IP packet, or<br>
frame. Such adaptation can influence the error control<br>
capability of the code. Techniques currently in use, only<br>
adapt the number of information symbols in order to fit the<br>
codeword into the transport unit. Usually, a code with a<br><br>
5<br>
longer codeword as needed for the given transport unit is<br>
chosen with the appropriate error control capability and then<br>
the number of information symbols is reduced. The control<br>
symbols are not modified. This adaptation, is termed in the<br>
literature "shortening". Using it, the amount of information<br>
symbols that are to be transmitted is reduced, thus not all<br>
information symbols are transmitted. Such adaptations,<br>
sometimes, do not allow the use of a code with higher error<br>
control capabilities. The terms "symbol/symbols" are<br>
equivalent and have the same meaning as the terms "bit/bits"<br>
and are used interchangeably.<br>
In order to overcome this, the code parameters are adapted to<br>
the available space of the transport unit for the information<br>
part (information symbols) and control part (control symbols)<br>
of the error control codeword that is to be transmitted.<br>
Within the application, the terms "information part" and<br>
"information symbol" are equivalent, have the same meaning<br>
and arc used interchangeably. The same applies for the terms<br>
"control part" and "control symbols". Therefore, in the<br>
proposed technique not only the information part but also the<br>
control part is shortened and in turn also incompletely<br>
transmitted, contrary to current use, where only whole<br>
information parts are shortened and then transmitted.<br>
In a finite field (also known as a Galois Field or GF(p)),<br>
consists of a set of values plus some defined arithmetic<br>
operations such that when these operations are carried out<br>
the result yields values only within the defined set. A GF(p)<br>
is called the prime field of order p, where p elements are<br>
denoted 0, 1,... p-1. The properties of a finite field are:<br>
a)	There are two defined operations, addition and<br>
multiplication.<br>
b)	The result of adding or multiplying two elements from the<br>
field is always an element of the field.<br>
c)	One element of the field is the element zero, such that<br>
cH-0 = α, for any element α in the field.<br><br>
6<br>
d) One clement of the field is unity, such that α x 1 = α,<br>
for any element a in the field.<br>
c) For every element a in the field, there is an additive<br>
inverse element -α, such that α+(-α) = 0. This allows the<br>
operation of subtraction to be defined as addition of the<br>
inverse.<br>
f)	For every nonzero element α in the field there is a<br>
multiplicative inverse element α-1, such that α x α-1 = 1.<br>
This allows the operation of division to be defined as a<br>
multiplication by the inverse.<br>
g)	The associative [α + (b + c) = (or + b) + c, α x (b + c) =<br>
(α x b) x c] , commutative [α + b = b + α, α x b = b x α], and<br>
distributative [α  x (b + c) = α x b + αxc] laws apply.<br>
Where α, b, c are elements of the field.<br>
In a GF(16) (Galois Field or Finite Field), for example, each<br>
individual piece of data can be expressed as a 4-bit<br>
combination. Instead of using all 4 bits when encoding the<br>
data, 1, 2, or 3 bits can be used depending on the predefined<br>
transport unit size and the application to be encoded. It can<br>
be seen that this technique provides a user with a lot more<br>
freedom to adapt the process to the requirements at hand and<br>
it also improves the overall error control capabilities of<br>
the scheme because the original code can be selected from<br>
bigger sets of codes with better error control capabilities.<br>
By assigning a fixed value to the parts (number of bits from<br>
the information part and control part) that are not used in<br>
the transmission, which is agreed upon by a sender and a<br>
receiver, the receiver can use known methods for decoding the<br>
received data, as it can fill in the missing parts. Thus<br>
avoiding any significant modification to the mechanism of a<br>
decoder. The agreement can be performed at any moment prior<br>
to the commencement of the step of representing the data over<br>
a finite field as a combination of bits, for example when the<br>
sender and the receiver initiate a call set up procedure.<br><br>
7<br>
Furthermore, the number of bits that are not used is<br>
distributed between the two parts depending on the type of<br>
data service required. For example if the service is voice or<br>
multimedia (i.e. voice and image) or data, the number of bits<br>
not used can be distributed between the two parts equally, or<br>
more to one part than the other, so that a better protection<br>
can be achieved and the data then can be more easily<br>
recovered. In this way the proposed technique provides added<br>
flexibility to the way that encoded data can be fitted into a<br>
transport unit.<br>
There follows an exemplary embodiment, that further<br>
illustrates the technique of the invention. In this example<br>
an ATM cell is used as the predefined transport unit, however<br>
it is obvious to any skilled person in the art that other<br>
predefined transport unit such as an IP packet or a frame can<br>
be substituted to the same effect. Additionally, a GF(8) is<br>
used whereby 3 bits are used to express each piece of data.<br>
The bit correspondence of a GF(8) is shown in the following<br>
table:<br><br>
000	0<br>
001	α0<br>
010	α1<br>
100	α2<br>
011	α3<br>
110	α4<br>
111	α5<br>
101	α6<br>
In a first example, it is required to protect the ATM cell<br>
header with increased error correcting capability. The<br>
standard solutions in the prior art, allow for all single bit<br>
errors in the 5 byte cell header to be corrected using one of<br>
the coll bytes for error control redundancy, abbreviated as<br>
the HFC-byte (Header Error Control - byte) . An ATM cell has a.<br><br>
8<br>
predefined size of 53 bytes, comprising a 48 byte payload and<br>
a 5 byte cell header.<br>
Within the cell header, there exist 4 bytes for information<br>
that translates to 32 bits and 1 byte for redundancy equal to<br>
8 bits.<br>
The error control code used to implement the technique, is<br>
defined over a GF(8) and has the following H matrix (1):<br><br>
The above matrix (1) has a special structure, which can be<br>
bettor seen if it is expressed as follows (2):<br><br>
The code used in this illustrative example, has an original<br>
form of an [17, 14, 3] code over a GF(8). Where 17 denotes<br>
the codeword length, 14 denotes the number of information<br>
symbols and 3 denotes the code distance. Therefore the<br>
codeword can be expressed using a vector (6):<br><br>
9<br><br>
The encoding of this systematic code can be described using a<br>
G matrix for which<br>
GHT = 0 (7) (where HT is the transposed matrix of H)<br>
as follows:<br><br>
where  is an information vector with 14<br>
coordinates over GF(8), which can contain 42 bits of<br>
information.<br>
The resulting codeword therefore contains 51 bits, 42 of<br>
which can transport information symbols (the information<br>
part) and the other 9 bits are formed by 3 control symbols<br>
(the control part). This corresponds to step 2 of the<br>
encoding algorithm shown in fig. 1. This codeword can correct<br>
any single bit error and any double bit error which appears<br>
in a GF(8) symbol and any triple bit error which appears in<br>
one symbol over GF(8).<br>
As stated before, the problem is that the parameters of the<br>
code (codeword length and information symbols) are not<br>
adapted to the available space of the cell header of an ATM<br>
cell, i.e. 32 bits for information and 8 bits for redundancy.<br>
Using the proposed technique, values can be assigned to parts<br>
of a particular symbol or whole symbols thus reducing its<br>
size. This corresponds to steps 3 and 4 of the encoding<br>
algorithm shown in fig. 1. For example, zero values can be<br>
assigned to the two lsb (least significant bit) positions of<br>
the information symbol i1, i12 and zero values to all the bits<br>
of i13, i14 in the information vector i . During encoding, the<br>
complete set of 14 symbols over GF(8) is used, including the<br>
predefined positions in the first symbol and all other bit<br><br>
10<br>
positions are filled with information bits according to the<br>
following matrix (9):<br><br>
Because the above matrices define a systematic code only<br>
multiplication with the last three columns of G is necessary.<br>
Once the multiplication is performed, only the msb (most<br>
significant bit) positions of symbols en = ii (which contains<br>
bi) and C6 = ii? (which contains b3?) are transmitted.<br>
Altogether, it is necessary to have 32 binary positions to<br>
transmit Ci7, c16, cX5f c14r Ci3, c12l Cn, ci0, c9, c8, c7, c6.<br>
From the remaining 8 binary positions 6 can be filled with<br>
symbol s c2, c3 and the last two binary positions with 2 msb<br>
of symbol Ci. The control symbol Ci can be calculated during<br>
encoding by multiplying the information vector with the third<br>
row of the H matrix.<br>
On the receiver side, in order to decode the above encoded<br>
information, after receiving and filling out the information<br>
of the incompletely transmitted symbols, step 1 of the<br>
decoding algorithmshown in fig. 2. It has to be noted here as<br>
stated above that the receiver is aware of the bits that were<br>
not transmitted, the receive vector v will have the form<br>
(10) :<br>
V =[Vi7, V16, V15, V14, V13, V12, Vn, Vio, Vg, V8, V7, V6, V5, V4, V3,<br>
V?, VT]<br>
It is further shown, that one of the coordinates can be<br>
corrected. An error in position i can be expressed as<br>
follows:<br><br><br>
11<br>
where Y denotes the error value. Let X denote the error<br>
locator within block A. In other words it determines which of<br>
the positions from a set corresponding to block A is in<br>
error. In our example two such sets exist:<br><br>
Therefore, if the value of X is known, the position of the<br>
error is known within a block A, but not within which block.<br>
If X = a3 the position v6 or V13 is in error.<br>
In order to decode and locate which positions are in error,<br>
the following syndromes are defined. (This corresponds to<br>
step 2., in fig. 2):<br><br>
Where Y is called the value of the error, X is called the<br>
error locator and Z is called the error block locator.<br>
The syndromes can be calculated by multiplication<br><br>
Where and HT is the transposed matrix H.<br>
After performing the syndrome calculation, in step 3 of fig.<br>
2, based on equation (17), the decoding process will continue<br>
as follows:<br><br>
12<br>
If S = (0, 0, 0), in step 3a of fig. 2, then the decoding is<br>
finished and it is estimated that no errors occurred during<br>
transmission and all the received bits in the corresponding<br>
positions of the received vector (10) are a correct estimate<br>
of the transmitted information.<br>
If S - (So, 0, 0) , .in step 3b of fig. 2, then an error has<br>
occurred in symbol C3 and its value is recalculated through<br>
encoding similarly to the encoding process, using received<br>
information bits, step 3d of fig. 2.<br>
If S = (0, Si, 0) , in step 3b of fig. 2, then an error has<br>
occurred in symbol c? and its value is recalculated through<br>
encoding similarly to the encoding process, using received<br>
information bits, step 3d of fig. 2.<br>
If S ~ (0, 0, S2), in step 3b of fig. 2, then an error has<br>
occurred in symbol ci and its value is recalculated through<br>
encoding similarly to the encoding process, using received<br>
information bits, step 3d of fig. 2.<br>
In the case of all other combinations in S, in step 3c of<br>
fig. 2, an error has occurred in other positions and the<br>
decoding will proceed as follows by calculating the values of<br>
Y, X, Z using the already calculated syndromes, in step 4 of<br>
fig. 2:<br>
Y - S0 (18)<br>
X = Si/Y (19)<br>
Z = S/Y (20)<br>
At this point, one symbol error in GF(8) can be corrected, as<br>
the value of the error is known as it is given by Y, the<br>
position within block A is given by X and the information in<br>
which one of sets Ai or A2 the error is located, is given by<br>
Z, step 6 of fig. 2.<br><br>
13<br>
Specifically if Z belongs to the set {a4, a5} then the error<br>
is .in set Ai . If Z belongs to the set {a2, a6} then the error<br>
is in set A2. In these two cases, step 6 of fig. 2, the<br>
errors having been detected will be in turn corrected.<br>
In the case that Z does not belong to the set {a4, a5 , a2,<br>
a6}, step 7 of fig. 2, or the error is located in positions<br>
that were not transmitted, then the decoding process has<br>
detected an uncorrectable error and a retransmission of the<br>
data can be requested, step 8 of fig. 2.<br>
As it can therefore be seen, the proposed technique of using<br>
incomplete symbols, provides for a very strong error<br>
correction capability, as all single bit errors as well as<br>
many double and triple bit errors can be corrected with the<br>
same redundancy of one byte. The term "incomplete symbols" is<br>
equivalent and has the same meaning as the term "incomplete<br>
bit". Specifically, the double and triple errors can be<br>
corrected if they are contained in one GF(8) symbol. In other<br>
words these errors, do not damage two distinct symbols from<br>
GF(8). In contrast, existing techniques can correct all<br>
single bit errors but only detect some additional error<br>
combinations.<br>
In a second illustrative example, the same encoding as in the<br>
first example is kept, with two small modifications. The<br>
first one is that only the first msb is transmitted from the<br>
symbol ci. The second one is that the one position that<br>
becomes available due to the first modification is filled<br>
with the overall parity check bit.<br>
The decoding process is similar to the decoding process in<br>
the first example with two alterations.<br>
1. The decision regarding the A block in which the symbol<br>
error is located is done using the following decision<br>
parameters:<br><br>
14<br>
If Z belongs to the set {a4, a5 , a2, a6}, then the error is<br>
located in the set Ai .<br>
If Z belongs to the set {0, a0 , a1, a3}, then the error is<br>
located in the set A2.<br>
2. After decoding, the overall parity check is done using<br>
decoded bits of information bits and parity bits. Using this<br>
parity check some uncorrectable errors can be detected as<br>
well as correcting the errors detected in the above first<br>
example, and appropriate action can be taken by the receiver,<br>
like requesting a retransmission of the data.<br>
Furthermore, it can be seen that in a more general adaptation<br>
of the parameters found in P. Farkas et al., "Modified<br>
Generalised Weighted Sum Codes for error control" chapter in<br>
the textbook "Coding Communications and Broadcasting", pp. 62<br>
- 72, Research Studies Press Ltd., England, Feb. 2000, other<br>
alternatives exist for adapting codes when constructed over a<br>
GF{8).<br>
When transmitting only the msb from symbol Ci the length of<br>
the code can be adapted from 8 bits to 43 bits. When<br>
transmitting the two msb from symbol ci the codeword length<br>
can be adapted from 8 bits to 72 bits and if the complete<br>
symbol ci is transmitted then the codeword length can be<br>
adapted from 9 bits to 103 bits. If 4 control (parity)<br>
symbols are used in the code over the same GF(8), then the<br>
length can be adapted in similar steps up to 650 bits.<br>
Furthermore, the proposed technique can be applied to other<br>
types of codes used in error control, like Reed Solomon<br>
codes, Hamming codes, convolutional codes, or block codes, as<br>
the technique is partially independent of the type of code<br>
used. The technique provides a designer with the freedom of<br>
choosing the type of code that is best suited for the data<br><br>
15<br>
that needs to be transmitted and at the same time it provided<br>
an increased level of error protection.<br>
Fig. 3a, provides a diagrammatic view of an apparatus that is<br>
arranged to execute the proposed method.<br>
An apparatus 100 in a communications system 10, comprises of<br>
control processor means 200 adapted to control the<br>
functioning of the apparatus, receive/transmit means 300<br>
adapted to receive and transmit data to and from at least one<br>
user 110 located in the communications system 1.0. These means<br>
300 are further adapted to transmit and receive data in<br>
transport units of a predefined size like a cell or packet or<br>
frame. The means 300 then pass on the received data to a<br>
buffer means 500 and to Forming/Filling means 400. These<br>
means 400 adapted to insert the bits of the incomplete<br>
symbols of the data received. Forming means 400 adapted to<br>
form a receive vector over a finite field that has a<br>
characteristic of 2. Naturally, the forming means 400 can be<br>
arranged to form a receive vector over a finite field that<br>
has a different characteristic, for example 3, 4 etc.<br>
Calculating means 600 adapted to perform a syndrome<br>
calculation based upon a series of defined syndromes and on<br>
the formed receive vector. Decoding means 700 are adapted to<br>
use the resultant syndromes for calculation and the decoding<br>
algorithm (decoding logic) to decode the received data, with<br>
the aid of the control processor means 200. The decoding<br>
means 700 are adapted to recognise and decode data that has<br>
been encoded using a Weighted Sum code, a Modified<br>
Generalised Weighted Sum code, a Reed Solomon code, a Hamming<br>
code, a Turbo Block code or similar types of error control<br>
codes. Detecting means 800 adapted to detect using the<br>
resulting decoding, a location of an occurrence of an error<br>
in the decoded data. Correcting means 500 adapted upon<br>
detection of said error to correct the error. The received<br>
data once corrected is outputted via adapted output means<br>
1000. All the means in the apparatus are coupled to the<br>
control means 200.<br><br>
16<br>
In fig. 4, an illustrative implementation of the structure of<br>
the calculating means 600 is shown. The calculating means 600<br>
comprises of delay elements, for example delay registers<br>
which can handle 3 bits of data at a time, adding and<br>
multiplication elements that add and multiply the incoming<br>
bits, with bits that have been stored during a previous<br>
input. The addition and multiplication is performed using the<br>
defined operations of the particular set of elements within<br>
the finite field, in this instance GF(8), however this can be<br>
modified depending on the type of finite field used. It is<br>
obvious to a person skilled in the art, that upon<br>
initialisation of the calculating means 600, there are no<br>
bits stored and that the delay elements are empty. The<br>
outputs generated are then, under the control of the control<br>
processor 200 and the decoding means 700 processed and passed<br>
on to the correcting means 900, which also receives the data<br>
buffered by the buffer means 500. With the aid of the<br>
detecting means 800 which detect the location of any errors<br>
the correcting means 900 will generate the correction of the<br>
data to be passed on to the output means 1000. Naturally,<br>
depending on the type of finite field used, the delay<br>
elements are adapted to handle the appropriate number of<br>
bits .<br>
The switches are controlled in accordance to the H matrix<br>
(sub-matrices A). The first branch from the top corresponds.<br>
to the first row in the H matrix, therefore there is no<br>
switch necessary because there are only Is in this row. In<br>
the second branch which corresponds to the second row in the<br>
H matrix from the beginning to the end of the left A sub-<br>
matrix, the upper sub-branch will multiply the symbol with a0<br>
,it will switch to the lower sub-branch and will stay in this<br>
position for the next 7 symbols. The third branch corresponds<br>
to the third row in the H matrix, and it functions similarly<br>
with the second branch. The same applies for the switches in<br>
fig. 5 which follows.<br><br>
17<br>
In tho event of no error or errors being detected, the<br>
received data is directly outputted by the output means 1000.<br>
In the event that an error has occurred but can not be<br>
corrected after detection, the control means 200 will request<br>
the user 110 to retransmit that particular part of the data<br>
again, by transmitting a request via the receive/transmit<br>
means 300.<br>
Additionally, the apparatus 100 can be used to encode data<br>
that .is to be transmitted on the network. Fig. 3b, provides a<br>
diagrammatic view of the apparatus, when it is used in this<br>
way. The apparatus 100 comprises of control processor means<br>
200 adapted to control the functioning of the apparatus,<br>
receive/transmit means 300 adapted to receive and transmit<br>
data to and from a user 110 also located in said<br>
communications system 10, data input means 410 for receiving<br>
data to be encoded, buffer means 500 for buffering a copy of<br>
the data to be transmitted, generating means 505 for<br>
generating the symbols of the received data, generating means<br>
510 for generating redundant symbols corresponding to the<br>
data that is being encoded, matching means 610 and removal<br>
means 650 adapted to match the encoded symbols to a<br>
predefined size of a transport unit that the control means<br>
200 stipulates, by removing bits from the encoded symbols and<br>
generating in turn incomplete symbols that are then<br>
transmitted to the user 110 via the receive/transmit means<br>
300.<br>
In fig.5, an illustrative implementation of the structure of<br>
the symbol generator 510 is shown. The symbol generator 510<br>
comprises of delay elements, for example delay registers<br>
which can handle 3 bits of data at a time, adding and<br>
multiplication elements that add and multiply the incoming<br>
bits, with bits that have been stored during a previous<br>
input. The addition and multiplication is performed using the<br>
defined operations of the particular set of elements within<br>
the finite field, in this instance GF(8), however this can be<br><br>
18<br>
modified depending on the type of finite field used. It is<br>
obvious to a person skilled in the art, that upon<br>
initialisation of the symbol generator 510, there are no bits<br>
stored and that the delay elements are empty. The outputs<br>
generated are then, under the control of the control<br>
processor 200, transmitted to the matching means 610, as well<br>
as the data from the buffer means 500, where the generated<br>
data is fitted to the appropriate size of the transportation<br>
unit.<br>
Naturally, depending on the type of finite field used, the<br>
delay elements are adapted to handle the appropriate number<br>
of bits.<br>
The apparatus is arranged to transmit data to a receiver and<br>
also to receive data from a sender in a communications<br>
system. Such an apparatus can be located in a communications<br>
system that is a wireless communication system, a landbase<br>
communications system such as a fibre-optic system or a<br>
copper-wire system, or a mixture of both. An example of such<br>
an apparatus is a base station or a mobile phone located in a<br>
mobile communications system.<br>

preferred embodiment described herein, those skilled in the<br>
art will appreciate other embodiments, modifications and<br>
applications which can be made without departing from the<br>
scope of the teachings of the invention. All such<br>
