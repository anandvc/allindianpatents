Description<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention is related to changing the number of channels in a<br>
multichannel audio signal in which some of the audio channels are combined.<br>
Applications include the presentation of multichannel audio in cinemas and vehicles. The<br>
invention includes not only methods but also corresponding computer program<br>
implementations and apparatus implementations.<br>
Background. Art<br>
In the last few decades, there has been an ever-increasing rise in the production,<br>
distribution and presentation of multichannel audio material. This rise has been driven<br>
significantly by the film industry in which 5.1 channel playback systems are almost<br>
ubiquitous and, more recently, by the music industry which is beginning to produce 5.1<br>
multichannel music.<br>
Typically, such audio material is presented through a playback system that has the<br>
same number of channels as the material. For example, a 5.1 channel film soundtrack<br>
may be presented in a 5.1 channel cinema or through a 5.1 channel home theater audio<br>
system. However, there is an increasing desire to play multichannel material over<br>
systems or in environments that do not have the same number of presentation channels as<br>
the number of channels in the audio material — for example, the playback of 5.1 channel<br>
material in a vehicle that has only two or four playback channels, or the playback of<br>
greater than 5.1 channel movie soundtracks in a cinema that is only equipped with a 5.1<br>
channel system. In such situations, there is a need to combine or "downmix" some or all<br>
of the channels of the multichannel signal for presentation.<br>
The combining of channels may produce audible artifacts. For example, some<br>
frequency components may cancel while other frequency components reinforce or<br>
become louder. Most commonly, this is a result of the existence of similar or correlated<br>
audio signal components in two or more of the channels that are being combined.<br>
It is an object of this invention to minimize or suppress artifacts that occur as a<br>
result of combining channels. Other objects will be appreciated as this document is read<br>
and understood.<br><br>
It should be noted that the combining of channels may be required for other<br>
purposes, not just for a reduction in the number of channels. For example, there may be a<br>
need to create an additional playback channel that is some combination of two or more of<br>
the original channels in the multichannel signal. This may be characterized as a type of<br>
"upmixing" in that the result is more than the original number of channels. Thus, whether<br>
in the context of "downmixing" or "upmixing," the combining of channels to create an<br>
additional channel may lead to audible artifacts.<br>
Common techniques for minimizing mixing or channel-combining artifacts<br>
involve applying, for example, one or more of time, phase, and amplitude (or power)<br>
adjustments to the channels to be combined, to the resulting combined channel, or to<br>
both. Audio signals are inherentiy dynamic— that is, their characteristics change over<br>
time. Therefore, such adjustments to audio signals are typically calculated and applied in<br>
a dynamic manner. While removing some artifacts resulting from combining, such<br>
dynamic processing may introduce other artifacts. To minimize such dynamic processing<br>
artifacts, the present invention employs Auditory Scene Analysis so that, in general,<br>
dynamic processing adjustments are maintained substantially constant during auditory<br>
scenes or events and changes in such adjustments are permitted only at or near auditory<br>
scene or event boundaries.<br>
Auditory Scene Analysis<br>
The division of sounds into units perceived as separate is sometimes referred to as<br>
"auditory event analysis" or "auditory scene analysis" ("ASA"). An extensive discussion<br>
of auditory scene analysis is set forth by Albert S. Bregman in his book Auditory Scene<br>
Analysis - The Perceptual Organization of Sound, Massachusetts Institute of Technology,<br>
1991, Fourth printing, 2001, Second MIT Press paperback edition.<br>
Techniques for identifying auditory events (including event boundaries) in<br>
accordance with aspects of Auditory Scene Analysis are set forth in U.S. Patent<br>

resulting from International Application PCT/US02/05806, filed February 25, 2002,<br>
designating the United States, published as WO 02/097791 on December 5, 2002. Each<br>
of said Crockett and Smithers applications are also hereby incorporated by reference in<br>
their entirety.<br>
Although techniques described in said Crockett and Crockett/Smithers<br>
applications are particularly useful in connection with aspects of the present invention,<br>
other techniques for identifying auditory events and event boundaries may be employed<br>
in aspects of the present invention.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
According to an aspect of the invention, a process for combining audio channels,<br>
comprises combining the audio channels to produce a combined audio channel, and<br>
dynamically applying one or more of time, phase, and amplitude or power adjustments to<br>
the channels, to the combined channel, or to both the channels and the combined channel,<br>
wherein one or more of said adjustments are controlled at least in part by a measure of<br>
auditory events in one or more of the channels and/or the combined channel. The<br>
adjustments may be controlled so as to remain substantially constant during auditory<br>
events and to permit changes at or near auditory event boundaries.<br>
The main goal of the invention is to improve the sound quality of combined audio<br>
signals. This may be achieved, for example, by performing, variously, time, phase and/or<br>
amplitude (or power) correction to the audio signals, and by controlling such corrections<br>
at least in part with a measure of auditory scene analysis information. In accordance with<br>
aspects of the present invention, adjustments applied to the audio signals generally may<br><br>
be held relatively constant during an auditory event and allowed to change at or near<br>
boundaries or transitions between auditory events. Of course, such adjustments need not<br>
occur as frequently as every boundary. The control of such adjustments may be<br>
accomplished on a channel-by-channel basis in response to auditory event information in<br>
each channel. Alternatively, some or all of such adjustments may be accomplished in<br>
response to auditory event information that has been combined over all channels or fewer<br>
than all channels.<br>
Other aspects of the present invention include apparatus or devices for performing<br>
the above-described processes and other processes described in the present application<br>
along with computer program implementations of such processes. Yet further aspects of<br>
the invention may be appreciated as this document is read and understood.<br>

Modes For Carrying Out The Invention<br>
A generalized embodiment of the present invention is shown in FIG. 1, wherein<br>
an audio channel combiner or combining process 100 is shown. A plurality of audio<br>
input channels, β input channels, 101-1 through 101-P are applied to a channel combiner<br>
or combining function ("Combine Channels") 102 and to an auditory scene analyzer or<br>
analysis function ("Auditory Scene Analysis") 103. There may be two or more input<br>
channels to be combined. Channels 1 through β may constitute some or all of a set of<br>
input channels. Combine Channels 102 combines the channels applied to it. Although<br>
such combination may be, for example, a linear, additive combining, the combination<br>
technique is not critical to the present invention. In addition to combining the channels<br>
applied to it, Combine Channels 102 also dynamically applies one or more of time, phase,<br>
and amplitude or power adjustments to the channels to be combined, to the resulting<br>
combined channel, or to both the channels to be combined and the resulting combined<br>
channel. Such adjustments may be made for the purpose of improving the quality of the<br>
channel combining by reducing mixing or channel-combining artifacts. The particular<br>
adjustment techniques are not critical to the present invention. Examples of suitable<br>
techniques for combining and adjusting are set forth in United States Provisional Patent<br>
Application S.N. 60/549,368 of Mark Franklin Davis, filed March 1, 2004, entitled "Low<br>
Bit Rate Audio Encoding and Decoding in Which Multiple Channels Are Represented by<br>
a Monophonic Channel and Auxiliary Information," attorneys' docket DOL11501, United<br>
States Provisional Application S.N. 60/579,974 of Mark Franklin Davis, et al, filed June<br>
14, 2004, entitled "Low Bit Rate Audio Encoding and Decoding in which Multiple<br>
Channels are Represented by a Monophonic Channel and Auxiliary Information,"<br>
attorneys' docket DOL11502, and United States Provisional Application S.N.<br>
60/588,256, of Mark Franklin Davis, et al filed July 14, 2004, entitled Low Bit Rate<br>
Audio Encoding and Decoding in which Multiple Channels are Represented by a<br>
Monophonic Channel and Auxiliary Information," attorneys' docket DOL11503. Each of<br>
said three provisional applications of Davis and Davis, et al are hereby incorporated by<br><br>
reference in their entirety. Auditory Scene Analysis 103 derives auditory scene<br>
information in accordance, for example, with techniques described in one or more of the<br>
above-identified applications by or some other suitable auditory scene analyzer or<br>
analysis process. Such information 104, which should include at least the location of<br>
boundaries between auditory events, is applied to Combine Channels 102. One or more<br>
of said adjustments are controlled at least in part by a measure of auditory events in one<br>
or more of the channels to be combined and/or the resulting combined channel.<br>
FIG. 2 shows an example of an audio signal processor or processing method 200<br>
embodying aspects of the present invention. Signals 101-1 through 101-P from a<br>
plurality of audio channels 1 through β that are to be combined are applied to a time and/<br>
or phase correction device or process ("Time &amp; Phase Correction") 202 and to an<br>
auditory scene analysis device or process ("Auditory Scene Analysis") 103, as described<br>
in connection with FIG. 1. Channels 1 through β may constitute some or all of a set of<br>
input channels. Auditory Scene Analysis 103 derives auditory scene information 104 and<br>
applies it to the Time &amp; Phase Correction 202, which applies time and/or phase correction<br>
individually to each of the channels to be combined, as is described below in connection<br>
with FIG. 3. The corrected channels 205-1 through 205-P are then applied to a channel<br>
mixing device or process ("Mix Channels") 206 that combines the channels to create a<br>
single output channel 207. Optionally, Mix Channels 206 may also be controlled by the<br>
Auditory Scene Analysis information 104, as is described further below.<br>
An audio signal processor or processing method embodying aspects of the present<br>
invention as in the examples of FIGS. 1 and 2 may also combine various ones of channels<br>
1 through β to produce more than one output channel.<br>
Auditory Scene Analysis 103 (FIGS. 1 and 2)<br>
Auditory scene analysis research has shown that the ear uses several different<br>
auditory cues to identify the beginning and end of a perceived auditory event. As taught<br>
in the above-identified applications, one of the most powerful cues is a change in the<br>
spectral content of the audio signal. For each input channel, Auditory Scene Analysis 103<br>
performs spectral analysis on the audio of each channel 1 through β at defined time<br>
intervals to create a sequence of frequency representations of the signal. In the manner<br>
described in said above-identified applications, successive representations may be<br>
compared in order to find a change in spectral content greater than a threshold. Finding<br><br>
such a change indicates an auditory event boundary between that pair of successive<br>
frequency representations, denoting approximately the end of one auditory event and the<br>
start of another. The locations of the auditory event boundaries for each input channel are<br>
output as components of the Auditory Scene Analysis information 104. Although this<br>
may be accomplished in the manner described in said above-identified applications,<br>
auditory events and uieir boundaries may be detected by other suitable techniques.<br>
Auditory events are perceived units of sound with characteristics that remain<br>
substantially constant throughout the event. If time, phase and/or amplitude (or power)<br>
adjustments, such as may be used in embodiments of the present invention, vary<br>
significantly within an auditory event, effects of such adjustments may become audible,<br>
constituting undesirable artifacts. By keeping adjustments constant throughout an event<br>
and only changing the adjustments sufficiently close to event boundaries, the similarity of<br>
an auditory event is not broken up and the changes are likely to be hidden among more<br>
noticeable changes in the audio content mat inherently signify the event boundary.<br>
Ideally, in accordance with aspects of the present invention, channel combining or<br>
"downmixing" parameters should be allowed to change only at auditory event boundaries,<br>
so that no dynamic changes occur within an event. However, practical systems for<br>
detecting auditory events typically operate in the digital domain in which blocks of digital<br>
audio samples in the time-domain are transformed into the frequency domain such that<br>
the time resolution of the auditory event boundaries have a fairly coarse time resolution,<br>
which resolution is related to the block lengm of the digital audio samples. If tiiat<br>
resolution is chosen (with a trade-off between block length and frequency resolution) to<br>
yield useful approximations to the actual event boundaries, mat is to say, if the resolution<br>
yields approximate boundaries mat are close enough so that the errors are not perceptible<br>
to a listener, then for the purposes of dynamic downmixing in accordance with the present<br>
invention, it is adequate to use not the actual boundaries, which are unknown, but rather<br>
the approximations provided by block boundaries. Thus, in accordance with an example<br>
in the above-identified applications of Crockett, event boundaries may be determined to<br>
within half a block length, or about 5.8 milliseconds for the example of a 512 sample<br>
block length in a system employing a 44.1 kHz sampling rate.<br>
In a practical implementation of aspects of the present invention, each input<br>
channel is a discrete time-domain audio signal. This discrete signal may be partitioned<br><br>
into overlapping blocks of approximately 10.6 milliseconds, in which the overlap is<br>
approximately 5.3 milliseconds. For an audio sample rate of 48 kHz, this is equivalent to<br>
512 sample blocks of which 256 samples overlaps with the previous block. Each block<br>
may be windowed using, for example, a Hanning window and transformed into the<br>
frequency domain using, for example, a Discrete Fourier Transform (implemented as a<br>
Fast Fourier Transform for speed). The power, in units of decibels (dB), is calculated for<br>
each spectral value and then the spectrum is normalized to the largest dB spectral value.<br>
Non-overlapping or partially overlapping blocks may be used to reduce the cost of<br>
computation. Also, other window functions may be used, however the Hanning window<br>
has been found to be well suited to this application.<br>
As described in the above-cited applications of Crockett, the normalized<br>
frequency spectrum for a current block may be compared to the normalized spectrum<br>
from the next previous block to obtain a measure of their difference. Specifically, a<br>
single difference measure may be calculated by summing the absolute value of the<br>
difference in the dB spectral values of the current and next previous spectrums.<br>
Such difference measure may then be compared to a threshold. If the difference measure<br>
is greater than the threshold, an event boundary is indicated between the current and<br>
previous block, otherwise no event boundary is indicated between the current and<br>
previous block. A suitable value for this threshold has been found to be 2500 (in units of<br>
dB). Thus, event boundaries may be determined within an accuracy of about half a block.<br>
This threshold approach could be applied to frequency subbands in which each<br>
subband has a distinct difference measure. However, in the context of the present<br>
invention, a single measure based on full bandwidth audio is sufficient in view of the<br>
perceived human ability to focus on one event at any moment in time.<br>
The auditory event boundary information for each channel 1 through β is output as a<br>
component of the Auditory Scene Analysis information 104.<br>
Time &amp; Phase Correction 202 (FIG. 2)<br>
Time and Phase Correction 202 looks for high correlation and time or phase<br>
differences between pairs of the input channels. FIG. 3 shows the Time and Phase<br>
Correction 202 in more detail. As explained below, one channel of each pair is a<br>
reference channel. One suitable correlation detection technique is described below.<br>
Other suitable correlation detection techniques may be employed. When a high<br><br>
correlation exists between a non-reference channel and a reference channel, the device or<br>
process attempts to reduce phase or time differences between the pair of channels by<br>
modifying the phase or time characteristics of the non-reference channel, thus reducing or<br>
eliminating audible channel-combining artifacts that would otherwise result from the<br>
combining of that pair of channels. Some of such artifacts may be described by way of an<br>
example. FIG. 5a shows the magnitude spectrum of a white noise signal. FIG. 5b shows<br>
the magnitude spectrum resulting from the simple combining of a first channel consisting<br>
of white noise with a second signal that is the same white noise signal but delayed in time<br>
by approximately 0.21 milliseconds. A combination of the undelayed and delayed<br>
versions of the white noise signal has cancellations and spectral shaping, commonly<br>
called comb filtering, and audibly sounds very different to the white noise of each input<br>
signal.<br>
FIG. 3 shows a suitable device or method 300 for removing phase or time delays.<br>
Signals 101-1 through 101-P from each input audio channel are applied to a delay<br>
calculating device or process ("Calc Delays") 301 that outputs a delay-indicating signal<br>
302 for each channel. The auditory event boundary information 104, which may have a<br>
component for each channel 1 through β, is used by a device or process that includes a<br>
temporary memory device or process ("Hold") 303 to conditionally update delay signals<br>
304-1 through 304-P that are used, respectively, by delay devices or functions ("Delay")<br>
305-1 through 305-P for each channel to produce output channels 306-1 through 306-P.<br>
Calc Delays 301 (FIG. 3)<br>
Calc Delays 301 measures the relative delay between pairs of the input channels.<br>
A preferred method is, first, to select a reference channel from among the input channels.<br>
This reference may be fixed or it may vary over time. Allowing the reference channel to<br>
vary, overcomes the problem, for example, of a silent reference channel. If the reference<br>
channel varies, it may be determined, for example, by the channel loudness (e.g., loudest<br>
is the reference). As mentioned above, the input audio signals for each input channel may<br>
be divided into overlapping blocks of approximately 10.6 milliseconds in length,<br>
overlapping by approximately 5.3 milliseconds. For an audio sample rate of 48 kHz, this<br>
is equivalent to 512 sample blocks of which 256 samples overlaps with the previous<br>
block.<br><br>
The delay between each non-reference channel and the reference channel may be<br>
calculated using any suitable cross-correlation method. For example, let S1 (length Nx)<br>
be a block of samples from the reference channel and S2 (length N2) a block of samples<br>
from one of the non-reference channels. First calculate the cross-correlation array Rh2 ■<br><br>
The cross-correlation may be performed using standard FFT based techniques to<br>
reduce execution time. Since both Sx and S2 are finite in length, the non-zero<br>
component of ^i,2 has a length of N^ + N2 -1. The lag I corresponding to the maximum<br>
element in -Ru represents the delay of S2 relative to S1.<br><br>
This lag or delay has the same sample units as the arrays S{ and S2.<br>
The cross-correlation result for the current block is time smoothed with the cross-<br>
correlation result from the previous block using a first order infinite impulse response<br>
filter to create the smoothed cross-correlation 
filter computation where m denotes the current block and m-1 denotes the previous block.<br><br>
A useful value for oc has been found to be 0.1. As for the cross-correlation Rx_2,<br>
the lag / corresponding to the maximum element in Q]a represents the delay of S2<br>
relative to Sx. The lag or delay for each non-reference channel is output as a signal<br>
component of signal 302. A value of zero may also output as a component of signal 302,<br>
representing the delay of the reference channel.<br><br>
The range of delay that can be measured is proportional to the audio signal block<br>
size. That is, the larger the block size, the larger the range of delays that can be measured<br>
using this method.<br>
Hold 303 (FIG. 3)<br>
When an event boundary is indicated via ASA information 104 for a channel,<br>
Hold 303 copies the delay value for that channel from 302 to the corresponding output<br>
channel delay signal 304. When no event boundary is indicated, Hold 303 maintains the<br>
last delay value 304. In this way, time alignment changes occur at event boundaries and<br>
are therefore less likely to lead to audible artifacts.<br>
Delay 305-1 through 305-P (FIG. 3)<br>
Since the delay signal 304 can be either positive or negative, each of the Delays<br>
305-1 through 305-P by default may be implemented to delay each channel by the<br>
absolute maximum delay that can be calculated by Calc Delays 301. Therefore, the total<br>
sample delay in each of the Delays 305-1 through 305-P is the sum of the respective input<br>
delay signal 304-1 through 304-P plus the default amount of delay. This allows for the<br>
signals 302 and 304 to be positive or negative, wherein negative indicates that a channel<br>
is advanced in time relative to the reference channel.<br>
When any of the input delay signals 304-1 through 304-P change value, it may be<br>
necessary either to remove or replicate samples. Preferably, this is performed in a manner<br>
that does not cause audible artifacts. Such methods may include overlapping and<br>
crossfading samples. Alternatively, because the output signals 306-1 to 306-P may be<br>
applied to a filterbank (see FIG. 4), it may be useful to combine the delay and filterbank<br>
such that the delay controls the alignment of the samples that are applied to the filterbank.<br>
Alternatively, a more complex method may measure and correct for time or phase<br>
differences in individual frequency bands or groups of frequency bands. In such a more<br>
complex method, both Calc Delays 301 and Delays 305-1 through 305-P may operate in<br>
the frequency domain, in which case Delays 305-1 through 305-P perform phase<br>
adjustments to bands or subbands, rather than delays in the time domain. In that case,<br>
signals 306-1 through 306-P are already in the frequency domain, negating the need for a<br>
subsequent Filterbank 401 (FIG. 4, as described below).<br><br>
Some of the devices or processes such as Calc Delays 301 and Auditory Scene<br>
Analysis 103 may look ahead in the audio channels to provide more accurate estimates of<br>
event boundaries and time or phase corrections to be applied to within events.[<br>
Mix Channels 206 (FIG. 2)<br>
Details of the Mix Channels 206 of FIG. 2 are shown as device or process 400 in<br>
FIG. 4, which shows how the input channels may be combined, with power correction, to<br>
create a downmixed output channel. In addition to mixing or combining the channels,<br>
this device or process may correct for residual frequency cancellations that were not<br>
completely corrected by Time &amp; Phase Correction 203 in FIG. 2. It also functions to<br>
maintain power conservation. In other words, Mix Channels 206 seeks to ensure that the<br>
power of the output downmix signal 414 (FIG. 4) is substantially the same as the sum of<br>
the power of the time or phase adjusted input channels 205-1 through 205-P.<br>
Furthermore, it may seek to ensure that the power in each frequency band of the<br>
downmixed signal is substantially the sum of the power of the corresponding frequency<br>
bands of the individual time or phase adjusted input channels. The process achieves this<br>
by comparing the band power from the downmixed channel to the band powers from the<br>
input channels and subsequently calculating a gain correction value for each band.<br>
Because changes in gain adjustments across both time and frequency may lead to audible<br>
artifacts, the gains preferably are both time and frequency smoothed before being applied<br>
to downmixed signal. This device or process represents one possible way of combining<br>
channels. Other suitable devices or processes may be employed. The particular<br>
combining device or process is not critical to the invention.<br>
Filterbank ("FB") 401-1 through 401 -P (FIG. 4)<br>
The input audio signals for each input channel are time-domain signals and may<br>
have been divided into overlapping blocks of approximately 10.6 milliseconds in length,<br>
overlapping by approximately 5.3 milliseconds, as mentioned above. For an audio<br>
sample rate of 48 kHz, this is equivalent to 512 sample blocks of which 256 samples<br>
overlaps with the previous block. The sample blocks may be windowed and converted to<br>
the frequency domain by Filterbanks 401-1 through 401-P (one filterbank for each input<br>
signal). Although any one of various window types may be used, a Hanning window has<br>
been found to be suitable. Although any one of various time-domain to frequency-<br>
domain converters or conversion processes may be used, a suitable converter or<br><br>
conversion method may use a Discrete Fourier Transform (implemented as a Fast Fourier<br>
Transform for speed). The output of each filterbank is a respective array 402-1 through<br>
402-P of complex spectral values — one value for each frequency band (or bin).<br>
Band("BND") Power 403-1 through 403-P (FIG. 4)<br>
For each channel, a band power calculator or calculating process ("BND Power")<br>
403-1 through 403-P, respectively, computes and calculates the power of the complex<br>
spectral values 402-1 through 402-P, and outputs them as respective power spectra 404-1<br>
through 404-P. Power spectrum values from each channel are summed in an additive<br>
combiner or combining function 415 to create a new combined power spectrum 405.<br>
Corresponding complex spectral values 402-1 through 402-P from each channel are also<br>
summed in an additive combiner or combining function 416 to create a downmix<br>
complex spectrum 406. The power of downmix complex spectrum 406 is computed in<br>
another power calculator or calculating process ("BMD Power") 403 and output as the<br>
downmix power spectrum 407.<br>
Band ("BND") Gain 408 (FIG. 4)<br>
A band gain calculator or calculating process (Band Gain 408) divides the power<br>
spectrum 405 by the downmix power spectrum 407 to create an array of power gains or<br>
power ratios, one for each spectral value. If a downmix power spectral value is zero<br>
(causing the power gain to be infinite), then the corresponding power gain is set to "1."<br>
The square root of the power gains is then calculated to create an array of amplitude gains<br>
409.<br>
Limit, Time &amp; Frequency Smooth 410 (FIG. 4)<br>
A limiter and smoother or limiting and smoothing function (Limit, Time &amp;<br>
Frequency Smooth) 410 performs appropriate gain limiting and time/frequency<br>
smoothing. The spectral amplitude gains discussed just above may have a wide range.<br>
Best results may be obtained if the gains are kept within a limited range. For example, if<br>
any gain is greater an upper threshold, it is set equal to the upper threshold. Likewise, for<br>
example, if any gain is less than a lower threshold, it is set equal to the lower threshold.<br>
Useful thresholds are 0.5 and 2.0 (equivalent to ±6 dB).<br>
The spectral gains may then be temporally smoothed using a first-order infinite impulse<br>
response QJR) filter. The following equation shows the filter computation where b<br>
denotes spectral band index, B denotes the total number of bands, n denotes the current<br><br>
block, n-1 denotes the previous block, G denotes the unsmoothed gains and Gs denotes<br>
the temporally smooth gains.<br><br>
A useful value for S(b) has been found to be 0.5 except for bands below<br>
approximately 200 Hz. Below this frequency, S(b) tends toward a final value of 0 at<br>
band b=0 or DC. If the smoothed gains Gs are initialized to 1.0, the value at DC stays<br>
equal to 1.0. That is, DC will never be gain adjusted and the gain of bands below 200 Hz<br>
will vary more slowly than bands in the rest of the spectrum. This may be useful in<br>
preventing audible modulations at lower frequencies. This is because at frequencies<br>
lower than 200 Hz, the wavelength of such frequencies approaches or exceeds the block<br>
size used by the filterbank, leading to inaccuracies in the filterbanks' ability to accurately<br>
discriminate these frequencies. This is a common and well-known phenomenon.<br>
The temporally-smoothed gains are further smoothed across frequency to prevent<br>
large changes in gain between adjacent bands. In the preferred implementation, the band<br>
gains are smoothed using a sliding five band (or approximately 470 Hz) average. That is,<br>
each bin is updated to be the average of itself and two adjacent bands both above and<br>
below in frequency. At the upper and lower edge of the spectrum, the edge values (bands<br>
0 and iV-1) are used repeatedly so that a five band average can still be performed.<br>
The smoothed band gains are output as signal 411 and multiplied by the downmix<br>
complex spectral values in a multiplier or multiplying function 419 to create the corrected<br>
downmix complex spectrum 412. Optionally, the output signal 411 may be applied to the<br>
multiplier or multiplying function 419 via a temporary memory device or process<br>
("Hold") 417 under control of the ASA information 104. Hold 417 operates in the same<br>
manner as Hold 303 of FIG. 3. For example, the gains could be held relatively constant<br>
during an event and only changed at event boundaries. In this way, possibly audible and<br>
dramatic gain changes during an event may be prevented.<br>
Inverse Filterbank (Inv FB) 413 (FIG. 4)<br>
The downmix spectrum 412 from multiplier or multiplying function 419 is passed<br>
through an inverse filterbank or filterbank function ("INV FB") 413 to create blocks of<br><br>
output time samples. This filterbank is the inverse of the input filterbank 401. Adjacent<br>
blocks are overlapped with and added to previous blocks, as is well known, to create an<br>
output time-domain signal 414.<br>
The arrangements described do not preclude the common practice of separating<br>
the window, at the forward filterbank 401, into two windows (one used at the forward and<br>
one used at the inverse filterbank) whose multiplication is such that unity signal is<br>
maintained through the system.<br>
Downmixing Applications<br>
One application of downmixing according to aspects of the present invention is<br>
the playback of 5.1 channel content in a motor vehicle. Motor vehicles may reproduce<br>
only four channels of 5.1 channel content, corresponding approximately to the Left,<br>
Right, Left Surround and Right Surround channels of such a system. Each channel is<br>
directed to one or more loudspeakers located in positions deemed suitable for<br>
reproduction of directional information associated with the particular channel. However<br>
motor vehicles usually do not have a center loudspeaker position for reproduction of the<br>
Center channel in such a 5.1 playback system. To accommodate this situation, it is<br>
known to attenuate the Center channel signal (by 3 dB or 6 dB for example) and to<br>
combine it with each of the Left and Right channel signals to provide a phantom center<br>
channel. However, such simple combining leads to artifacts previously described.<br>
Instead of applying such a simple combining, channel combining or downmixing<br>
according to aspects of the present invention may be applied. For example, the<br>
arrangement of FIG. 1 or the arrangement of FIG. 2 may be applied twice, once for<br>
combining the Left and Center signals, and once for combining Center and Right signals.<br>
However, it may still be beneficial to attenuate the Center channel signal by, for example,<br>
3 dB or 6 dB (6 dB may be more appropriate than 3 dB in the near-field space of a motor<br>
vehicle interior) before combining it with each of the Left Channel and Right Channels<br>
signals so that output acoustical power from the Center channel signal is approximately<br>
the same as it would be if presented through a dedicated Center channel speaker.<br>
Furthermore, it may be beneficial to denote the Center signal as the reference channel<br>
when combining it with each of the Left Channel and Right Channel signals such that the<br>
Time &amp; Phase Correction 103 to which the Center channel signal is applied does not alter<br>
the time alignment or phase of the Center channel but only alters the time alignment or<br><br>
phase of the Left Channel and the Right Channel signals. Consequently, the Center<br>
Channel signal would not be adjusted differently in each of the two summations (i.e., the<br>
Left Channel plus Center Channel signals summation and the Right Channel plus Center<br>
Channel signals summation), thus ensuring that the phantom Center Channel image<br>
remains stable.<br>
The inverse may also be applicable. That is, time or phase adjust only the Center<br>
channel, again ensuring that the phantom Center Channel image remains stable.<br>
Another application of the downmixing according to aspects of the present<br>
invention is in the playback of multichannel audio in a cinema. Standards under<br>
development for the next generation of digital cinema systems require the delivery of up<br>
to, and soon to be more than, 16 channels of audio. The majority of installed cinema<br>
systems only provide 5.1 playback or "presentation" channels (as is well known, the "0.1"<br>
represents the low frequency "effects" channel). Therefore, until the playback systems<br>
are upgraded, at significant expense, there is the need to downmix content with more than<br>
5.1 channels to 5.1 channels. Such downmixing or combining of channels leads to<br>
artifacts as discussed above.<br>
Therefore, if β channels are to be downmixed to Q channels (where β &gt; Q) then<br>
downmixing according to aspects of the present invention (e.g., as in the exemplary<br>
embodiments of FIGS. 1 and 2) may be applied to obtain one or more of the Q output<br>
channels in which some or all of the output channels are a combination of two or more of<br>
respective ones of the β input channels. If an input channel is combined into more than<br>
one output channel, it may be advantageous to denote such a channel as a reference<br>
channel, such that the Time &amp; Phase Correction 202 in FIG. 2 does not alter the time<br>
alignment or phase of such an input channel differently for each output channel into<br>
which it is combined.<br>
Alternatives<br>
Time or phase adjustment, as described herein, serves to minimize the complete or<br>
partial cancellation of frequencies during downmixing. Previously, it was described that<br>
when an input channel is combined into more than one output channel, that this channel<br>
preferably is denoted as the reference channel such that it is not time or phase adjusted<br>
differently when mixed to multiple output channels. This works well when the other<br>
channels do not have content that is substantially the same. However, situations can arise<br><br>
where two or more other channels have content that is the same or substantially the same.<br>
If such channels are combined into more than one output channel, when listening to the<br>
resulting output channels, the common content is perceived as a phantom image in space<br>
in a direction that is somewhere between the physical locations of the loudspeakers<br>
receiving those output channels. The problem arises when these two or more input<br>
channels, with substantially equivalent content, are independently phase adjusted prior to<br>
being combined with other channels to create the output channels. The independent<br>
phase adjustment can lead to both incorrect phantom image location, and/or indeterminate<br>
image location, both of which may be audibly perceived as unnatural.<br>
It is possible to devise a system that looks for input channels having substantially<br>
similar content and attempts to time or phase adjust such channels in the same or similar<br>
way such that their phantom image location is not altered. However, such a system<br>
becomes very complex, especially as the number of input channels becomes substantially<br>
larger than the number of output channels. In systems where substantially similar content<br>
frequently occurs in more than one input channel, it may be simpler to dispense with<br>
phase adjustment, and perform only power correction.<br>
This adjustment problem can be explained further in the automobile application<br>
described previously in which the Center channel signal is combined with each of the Left<br>
and Right channels for playback through the Left and Right loudspeakers, respectively.<br>
In 5.1 channel material, the Left and Right input channels often contain a plurality of<br>
signals (e.g., instruments, vocals, dialog and/or effects), some of which are different and<br>
some of which are the same. When the Center channel is mixed with each of the Left and<br>
Right channels, the Center channel is denoted as the reference channel and is not time or<br>
phase adjusted. The Left channel is time or phase adjusted so as to produce minimal<br>
phase cancellation when combined with the Center channel, and similarly the Right<br>
channel is time or phase adjusted so as to produce minimal phase cancellation when<br>
combined with the Center channel. Because the Left and Right channels are time or<br>
phase adjusted independently, signals tiiat are common to the Left and Right channels<br>
may no longer have a phantom image between the physical locations of the Left and<br>
Right loudspeakers. Furthermore, the phantom image may not be localized to any one<br>
direction but may be spread throughout the listening space — an unnatural and<br>
undesirable effect.<br><br>
A solution to the adjustment problem is to extract signals that are common to<br>
more than one input channel from such input channels and place them in new and<br>
separate input channels. Although this increases the overall number of input channels β to be downmixed, it reduces spurious and undesirable phantom image distortion in the<br>
output downmixed channels. An automotive example device or process 600 is shown in<br>
FIG. 6 for the case of three channels being downmixed to two. Signals common to the<br>
Left and Right input channels are extracted from the Left and Right channels into another<br>
new channel using any suitable channel multiplier or multiplication process ("Decorrelate<br>
Channels") 601 such as an active matrix decoder or other type of channel multiplier that<br>
extracts common signal components. Such a device may be characterized as a type of<br>
decorrelator or decorrelation function. One suitable active matrix decoder, known as<br>
Dolby Surround Pro Logic II, is described in U.S. Patent Application S.N. 09/532,711 of<br>

audio signals from two input audio signals", attorneys' docket DOL07201 and U.S.<br>

their entirety. Another type of suitable channel multiplier and decorrelator that may be<br>
employed is described in U.S. Patent Application S.N. 10/467,213 of Mark Franklin<br>

February 7, 2002, designating the United States, published as WO 02/063925 on August<br>
7, 2003, and International Application PCT/US03/24570, filed 08/06/2003, designating<br>
the United States, attorneys' docket DOL08801PCT published as WO 2004/019656 on<br>
03/04/2004. Each of said Davis applications is hereby incorporated by reference in its<br>
entirety. Another suitable channel multiplication/decorrelation technique is described in<br>
"Intelligent Audio Source Separation using Independent Component Analysis," by<br>
Mitianoudis and Davies, Audio Engineering Society Convention Paper 5529, Presented at<br><br>
the 112th Convention, May 10-13, 2002, Munich, Germany. Said paper is also hereby<br>
incorporated by reference in its entirety. The result is four channels, the new channel CD,<br>
the original Center channel C and the modified Left and Right channels, LD and ~RD.<br>
The device or process 602, based on the arrangement of FIG. 2, but here with two<br>
output channels, combines the four channels to create Left and Right playback channels<br>
Lp and Rp. The modified channels Ln and Rz&gt; are each mixed to only one playback<br>
channel; hP and RP respectively. Because they do not substantially contain any correlated<br>
content, the modified channels LD and RD, from which their common component CD has<br>
been extracted, can be time or phase adjusted without affecting any phantom center<br>
images present in the input channels L and R. To perform the time and/or phase<br>
adjustment, one of the channels such as channel CD is denoted as the reference channel.<br>
The other channels LD, Rfl and C are then time and/or phase adjusted relative to the<br>
reference channel. Alternatively since the L0 and RD channels are unlikely to be<br>
correlated with the C channel, and since they are decorrelated from the CD channel by<br>
means of process 601, they may be passed to mix channels without any time or phase<br>
adjustment. Both original channel C and the derived center channel CD may be mixed<br>
with each of the intermediate channels LD and RD, respectively, in the Mix Channels<br>
portion of device or process 602 to produce the playback channels LP and RP. Although<br>
an equal proportion of C and CD has been found to produce satisfactory results, the exact<br>
proportion is not critical and may be other than equal. Consequently, any time and phase<br>
adjustment applied to CD and C will appear in both playback channels, thus maintaining<br>
the direction of phantom center images. Some attenuation (for example 3 dB) may be<br>
required on each of the center channels since these channels are reproduced through two<br>
speakers, and not one. Also the amount of each of the center channels C and CD that is<br>
mixed into the output channels could be controlled by the listener. For example the<br>
listener may desire all of the original center channel C but some attenuation on the<br>
derived center channel CD.<br>
The solution may also be explained by way of an example in cinema audio. FIGS.<br>
7a and 7b show the room or spatial locations of two sets of audio channels. FIG. 7a<br>
shows the approximate spatial locations of the channels as presented in the multichannel<br>
audio signal, otherwise denoted as "content channels". FIG. 7b shows the approximate<br>
locations of channels, denoted as "playback channels," that can be reproduced in a<br><br>
cinema that is equipped to play five channel audio material. Some of the content<br>
channels have corresponding playback channel locations; namely, the L, C. R, Rs and Ls<br>
channels. Other content channels do not have corresponding playback channel locations<br>
and therefore must be mixed into one or more of the playback channels. A typical<br>
approach is to combine such content channels into the nearest two playback channels.<br>
As previously mentioned, simple additive combining may lead to audible artifacts.<br>
As also mentioned, combining as described in connection with FIGS. 1 and 2 may also<br>
lead to phantom imaging artifacts when channels mat have substantially common content<br>
are phase or time adjusted differently. A solution includes extracting signals that are<br>
common to more than one input channel from such input channels and place them in new<br>
and separate channels.<br>
FIG. 7c shows a device or process 700 for the case in which five additional<br>
channels Qx to Q5 are created by extracting information common to some combinations of<br>
the input or content channels using device or process ("Decorrelate Channels") 701.<br>
Device or process 701 may employ a suitable channel multiplication/decorrelation<br>
technique such as described above for use in the "Decorrelate Channels" device or<br>
function 601. The actual number and spatial location of these additional intermediate<br>
channels may vary according to variations in the audio signals contained in the content<br>
channels. The device or process 702, based on the arrangement of FIG.2, but here with<br>
five output channels, combines the intermediate channels from Decorrelate Channels 701<br>
to create the five playback channels.<br>
For time and phase correction, one of the intermediate channels such as the C<br>
channel, may be denoted as the reference channel and all other intermediate channels be<br>
time and phase adjusted relative to this reference. Alternatively, it may be beneficial to<br>
denote more than one of the channels as reference channels and thus perform time or<br>
phase corrections in smaller groups of channels than the total number of intermediate<br>
channels. For example if channel Qi represents common signals extracted out of content<br>
channels L and C, and if Qi and Lc are being combined with intermediate channels L and<br>
C to create the playback channels L and C, channel Lc may be denoted as the reference<br>
channel. Intermediate channels L, C and Qi are then time or phase adjusted relative to the<br>
reference intermediate channel Lc. Each smaller group of intermediate channels is time<br><br>
or phase adjusted in succession until all intermediate channels have been considered by<br>
the time and phase correction process.<br>
In creating the playback channels, device or process 702 may assume a priori<br>
knowledge of the spatial locations of the content channels. Information regarding the<br>
number and spatial location of the additional intermediate channels may be assumed or<br>
may be passed to the device or process 702 from the decorrelating device or process 701<br>
via path 703. This enables process or device 702 to combine the additional intermediate<br>
channels into, for example, the nearest two playback channels so that phantom image<br>
direction of these additional channels is maintained.<br>
Implementation<br>
The invention may be implemented in hardware or software, or a combination of<br>
both {e.g., programmable logic arrays). Unless otherwise specified, the algorithms<br>
included as part of the invention are not inherently related to any particular computer or<br>
other apparatus. In particular, various general-purpose machines may be used with<br>
programs written in accordance with the teachings herein, or it may be more convenient<br>
to construct more specialized apparatus (e.g., integrated circuits) to perform the required<br>
method steps. Thus, the invention may be implemented in one or more computer<br>
programs executing on one or more programmable computer systems each comprising at<br>
least one processor, at least one data storage system (including volatile and non-volatile<br>
memory and/or storage elements), at least one input device or port, and at least one output<br>
device or port. Program code is applied to input data to perform the functions described<br>
herein and generate output information. The output information is applied to one or more<br>
output devices, in known fashion.<br>
Each such program may be implemented in any desired computer language<br>
(including machine, assembly, or high level procedural, logical, or object oriented<br>
programming languages) to communicate with a computer system. In any case, the<br>
language may be a compiled or interpreted language.<br>
Each such computer program is preferably stored on or downloaded to a storage<br>
media or device (e.g., solid state memory or media, or magnetic or optical media)<br>
readable by a general or special purpose programmable computer, for configuring and<br>
operating the computer when the storage media or device is read by the computer system<br>
to perform the procedures described herein. The inventive system may also be considered<br><br>
to be implemented as a computer-readable storage medium, configured with a computer<br>
program, where the storage medium so configured causes a computer system to operate in<br>
a specific and predefined manner to perform the functions described herein.<br>
A number of embodiments of the invention have been described. Nevertheless, it<br>
will be understood that various modifications may be made without departing from the<br>
spirit and scope of the invention. For example, some of the steps described above may be<br>
order independent, and thus can be performed in an order different from that described.<br>
Accordingly, other embodiments are within the scope of the following claims.<br><br>

channel β, and/or one or both of the combined output channels a" and 8",<br>
wherein one or more of said adjustments are controlled at least in part by a<br>
measure of auditory events in one or more channels of the input channels, the<br>
intermediate channels, and/or the combined output channels, an audio segment in<br>
a channel between consecutive boundaries constituting an auditory event, and<br>
wherein each auditory event boundary is identified in response to a change<br>
in spectral content with respect to time in a channel exceeding a threshold such<br>
that a set of auditory event boundaries is obtained for the channel.<br><br>
2.	A process as claimed in claim 1 wherein the consecutive spatial directions α, <br>
β, and 8 are one of the sets of directions:<br>
left, center, and right,<br>
left, left center, and center,<br>
center, right center, and right,<br>
right, right middle, and right surround,<br>
right surround, center back, and left surround, and<br>
left surround, left middle, and left.<br>
3.	A process as claimed in any one claim 1 or claim 2 wherein said adjustments<br>
are controlled so as to remain substantially constant during auditory events and to<br>
permit changes at or near auditory event boundaries.<br>
4.	A process as claimed in claim 3 wherein identifying auditory event<br>
boundaries in a channel includes dividing the audio signal into time blocks,<br>
converting the data in each block to the frequency domain, and comparing the<br>
normalized frequency spectrum for a current block to the normalized frequency<br>
spectrum from the immediately preceding block.<br>

Abstract<br><br><br>
Process For Combining Audio Channels<br>
A process for combining audio channels combines the audio channels (102)<br>
to produce a combined audio channel and dynamically applies one or more of<br>
time, phase, and amplitude or power adjustments (202, 403), to the channels, to<br>
the combined channel, or to both the channels and the combined channel. One or<br>
more of the adjustments are controlled at least in part by a measure of auditory<br>
events (103) in one or more of the channels and/or the combined channel.<br>
Applications include the presentation of multichannel audio in cinemas and<br>
vehicles.</td>
