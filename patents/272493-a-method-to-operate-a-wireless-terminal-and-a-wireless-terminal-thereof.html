				<td>METHODS AND APPARATUS FOR SUPPORTING QUALITY OF SERVICE IN COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS<br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br><br>
[0001] This invention relates to communications system and, more particularly, to methods and apparatus for supporting quality of service differentiation between traffic flows in a communication system.<br><br>
BACKGROUND<br><br>
[0002] Communication systems frequently include a plurality of network nodes which are coupled to access nodes, e.g., base stations, through which end nodes, e.g., user devices or terminals that may be either fixed or mobile, are coupled to the network.<br><br>
[0003] In a typical cellular communication network, a set of geographically dispersed base stations provide wireless access to a communications infrastructure. Users with wireless communication devices, or terminals, are able to establish a direct communication link with a suitable base station (or set of base stations) and then exchange information with other users and/or end systems throughout the communication network. Such systems could be designed to support a variety of different applications (e.g., telephony, text messaging, streaming audio/video, web browsing, file transfer, etc.); however, traditional systems have been primarily designed for telephony.<br><br>
[0004] Due, in part, to their telephony focused design, traditional, circuit- switched, cellular networks provide little to no support for quality of service differentiation between traffic flows to/from various user devices, e.g., wireless terminals. However, circuit- switched, cellular network technology is presently being extended to support data applications as well. Additionally, there are emerging packet- switched cellular network technologies, which may be better suited for supporting a wide range of applications, including interactive data applications like instant messaging and online gaming. As cellular network technology evolves to support a wider range of diverse applications with differing requirements, new quality of service support <br><br>
mechanisms that enable differentiation between various traffic flows would be desirable. Note that many communication systems other than cellular networks have similar limitations and would also benefit from improved quality of service support mechanisms. Accordingly, there is a need for methods and apparatus that can provide functionality such as treating packets associated with identified traffic flows with different quality of service levels and/or dynamically controlling the quality of service support mechanisms to meet the requirements of various traffic flows.<br><br>
[0005] In view of the above discussion, it should be appreciated that there is a need for new and improved ways of supporting quality of service in communication systems.<br><br>
SUMMARY<br><br>
[0006] In accordance with various embodiments, an access node, e.g., base station, determines a configuration of an end node, e.g., wireless terminal, intended to support a specific traffic flow and sends a configuration command to the wireless terminal. For example, a base station may determine one or more parameters associated with classification, queue management, scheduling, and/or automatic repeat request, and then send a configuration command to the wireless terminal instructing it to implement a configuration operation. In some embodiments, a wireless terminal sets the value of an internal parameter to a value directly provided by the base station in a configuration command. In some embodiments, a wireless terminal determines and sets the value of an internal parameter as a function of information included in the configuration command from the base station. For example, a configuration command from a base station may include an indication of loss tolerance for packets corresponding to a traffic flow, and a wireless terminal may set the value of automatic repeat request parameters in order to ensure the intended loss tolerance is not exceeded.<br><br>
[0007] An exemplary method of operating an access node in accordance with an exemplary embodiment includes determining wireless terminal configuration parameters corresponding to a traffic flow and communicating a configuration command instructing a wireless terminal, to which the traffic flow corresponds, to implement a configuration operation corresponding to at least one determined configuration parameter. An <br><br>
exemplary base station in accordance with an exemplary embodiment includes a parameter determination module for determining wireless terminal configuration parameters corresponding to a traffic flow and a communication module for communicating a configuration command instructing a wireless terminal, to which the traffic flow corresponds, to implement a configuration operation corresponding to at least one determined configuration parameter.<br><br>
[0008] An exemplary method of operating a wireless terminal in accordance with an exemplary embodiment includes receiving a message including configuration information associated with a traffic flow and implementing a configuration operation using said received configuration information. An exemplary wireless terminal in accordance with an exemplary embodiment includes a receiver for receiving a message including configuration information associated with a traffic flow and a configuration control module for implementing a configuration operation using said received configuration information.<br><br>
[0009] The methods and apparatus of various embodiments for supporting quality of service differentiation between traffic flows in a communication system can be used with a wide range of communications systems. For example various embodiments can be used with systems that support mobile communications devices such as notebook computers equipped with wireless modems and a wide variety of other devices that support wireless interfaces in the interests of device mobility, e.g., phones and/or Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs). Various embodiments can also be used with systems that support fixed communication devices, e.g., coupled to the network via either wireless or wired communication links.<br><br>
[0010] While various embodiments have been discussed in the summary above, it should be appreciated that not necessarily all embodiments include the same features and some of the features described above are not necessary but can be desirable in some embodiments. Numerous additional features, embodiments and benefits of the various embodiments are discussed in the detailed description which follows. <br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:<br><br>
[0024] Figure 1 illustrates an exemplary communication system 100 implemented in accordance with various embodiments, e.g., a cellular communication network, which comprises a plurality of nodes interconnected by communications links. The network may use Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) signals to communicate information over wireless links. However, other types of signals, e.g., Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) signals or Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) signals, might be used instead. Nodes in the exemplary communication system 100 exchange information using signals, e.g., messages, based on communication protocols, e.g., the Internet Protocol (IP). The communications links of the system 100 may be implemented, for example, using wires, fiber optic cables, and/or wireless communications techniques. The exemplary communication system 100 includes a plurality of end nodes 144, 146, 144', 146', 144", 146", which access the communication system via a plurality of access nodes 140, 140', 140". The end nodes 144, 146, 144', 146', 144", 146" may be, e.g., wireless communication devices or terminals, and the access nodes 140, 140', 140" may be, e.g., wireless access routers or base stations. The exemplary communication system 100 also includes a number of other nodes 102, 104, 106, 108, 110, and 112, used to provide interconnectivity or to provide specific services or functions. <br><br>
[0025] The Figure 1 exemplary system 100 depicts a network 101 that includes an access control node 102, a mobility support node 104, a policy control node 106, and an application server node 108, all of which are connected to an intermediate network node 110 by a corresponding network link 103, 105, 107, and 109, respectively. In some embodiments, the access control node 102, e.g., a Remote Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS) or Diameter server, supports authentication, authorization, and/or accounting of end nodes and/or services associated with end nodes. In some embodiments, the mobility support node 104, e.g., a Mobile IP home agent and/or context transfer server, supports mobility, e.g., handoff, of end nodes between access nodes, e.g., via redirection of traffic to/from end nodes and/or transfer of state associated with end nodes between access nodes. In some embodiments, the policy control node 106, e.g., a policy server or Policy Decision Point (PDP), supports policy authorization for services or application layer sessions. In some embodiments, the application server node 108, e.g., a Session Initiation Protocol server, streaming media server, or other application layer server, supports session signaling for services available to end nodes and/or provides services or content available to end nodes.<br><br>
[0026] The intermediate network node 110 in the network 101 provides interconnectivity to network nodes that are external from the perspective of the network 101 via network link 111. Network link 111 is connected to another intermediate network node 112, which provides further connectivity to a plurality of access nodes 140, 140', 140" via network links 141, 141', 141", respectively.<br><br>
[0027] Each access node 140, 140', 140" is depicted as providing connectivity to a plurality of N end nodes (144, 146), (144', 146'), (144", 146"), respectively, via corresponding access links (145, 147), (145', 147'), (145", 147"), respectively. In the exemplary communication system 100, each access node 140, 140', 140" is depicted as using wireless technology, e.g., wireless access links, to provide access. A radio coverage area, e.g., communications cell, 148, 148', 148" of each access node 140, 140', 140", respectively, is illustrated as a circle surrounding the corresponding access node.<br><br>
[0028] The exemplary communication system 100 is subsequently used as a basis for the description of various embodiments. Alternative embodiments include various network topologies, where the number and type of nodes (including network <br><br>
nodes, access nodes, end nodes, as well as various control, support, and server nodes), the number and type of links, and the interconnectivity between various nodes may differ from that of the exemplary communication system 100 depicted in Figure 1.<br><br>
[0029] In various embodiments some of the functional entities depicted in Figure 1 may be omitted or combined. The location or placement of these functional entities in the network may also be varied.<br><br>
[0030] Figure 2 provides a detailed illustration of an exemplary end node 200, e.g., wireless terminal, implemented in accordance with various embodiments. The exemplary end node 200, depicted in Figure 2, is a detailed representation of an apparatus that may be used as any one of the end nodes 144, 146, 144', 146', 144", 146", depicted in Figure 1. In the Figure 2 embodiment, the end node 200 includes a processor 204, a wireless communication interface module 230, a user input/output interface 240 and memory 210 coupled together by bus 206. Accordingly, via bus 206 the various components of the end node 200 can exchange information, signals and data. The components 204, 206, 210, 230, 240 of the end node 200 are located inside a housing 202.<br><br>
[0031] The wireless communication interface module 230 provides a mechanism by which the internal components of the end node 200 can send and receive signals to/from external devices and network nodes, e.g., access nodes. The wireless communication interface module 230 includes, e.g., a receiver module 232 with a corresponding receiving antenna 236 and a transmitter module 234 with a corresponding transmitting antenna 238 used for coupling the end node 200 to other network nodes, e.g., via wireless communications channels.<br><br>
[0032] The exemplary end node 200 also includes a user input device 242, e.g., keypad, and a user output device 244, e.g., display, which are coupled to bus 206 via the user input/output interface 240. Thus, user input/output devices 242, 244 can exchange information, signals and data with other components of the end node 200 via user input/output interface 240 and bus 206. The user input/output interface 240 and associated devices 242, 244 provide a mechanism by which a user can operate the end node 200 to accomplish various tasks. In particular, the user input device 242 and user <br><br>
output device 244 provide the functionality that allows a user to control the end node 200 and applications, e.g., modules, programs, routines and/or functions, that execute in the memory 210 of the end node 200.<br><br>
[0033] The processor 204 under control of various modules, e.g., routines, included in memory 210 controls operation of the end node 200 to perform various signaling and processing. The modules included in memory 210 are executed on startup or as called by other modules. Modules may exchange data, information, and signals when executed. Modules may also share data and information when executed.

[0036] The traffic control module 250 controls processing relating to receiving and sending data information, e.g., messages, packets, and/or frames, via the wireless communication interface module 230. The exemplary traffic control module includes configuration information 251 as well as various additional modules 252, 253, 254, 255, 256, 257, 258, and 259 that control various aspects of quality of service for packets and/or traffic flows, e.g., associated sequences of packets. In some embodiments, the traffic control module 250 includes state information, e.g., parameters, status and/or other information, relating to operation of the end node 200, the traffic control module 250, and/or one or more of the various additional modules included therein 252, 253, 254, 255, 256, 257, 258, and 259. The configuration information 251, e.g., parameter settings, determines, affects and/or prescribes operation of the traffic control module 250 and/or the various additional modules included therein 252, 253, 254, 255, 256, 257, 258, and 259. The various additional modules are included, in some embodiments, to perform particular functions and operations as needed to support specific aspects of traffic control. In various embodiments, modules may be omitted and/or combined as needed depending on the functional requirements of traffic control. A description of each additional module included in the exemplary traffic control module 250 follows.<br><br>
[0037] The admission control module 252 maintains information relating to resource utilization/availability and determines if sufficient resources are available to support the quality of service requirements of particular traffic flows. Resource availability information maintained by the admission control module 252 includes, e.g., packet and/or frame queuing capacity, scheduling capacity, as well as processing and memory capacity needed to support one or more traffic flows. The control signaling module 212, application module 214, and/or other modules included in the end node 200 may, and in some embodiments do, query the admission control module 252 to <br><br>
determine if sufficient resources are available to support a new or modified traffic flow, where the admission control determination is a function of the quality of service requirements of the particular traffic flow and/or the available resources. The configuration information 251 may, and in some embodiments does, include configuration information, e.g., parameters settings, that affect the operation of the admission control module 252, e.g., an admission control threshold value that indicates the percentage of resource that may be allocated prior to rejecting additional requests.<br><br>
[0038] The uplink scheduler module 253 controls processing relating to transmission scheduling, e.g., order and/or timing, and allocation of transmission resources, e.g., information coding rate, transmission time slots, and/or transmission power, for data information, e.g., messages, packets, and/or frames, to be sent via the wireless interface module 230, e.g., from the end node 200 to an access node. The uplink scheduler module 253 may, and in some embodiments does, schedule transmissions and allocate transmission resources as a function of the quality of service requirements and/or constraints associated with one or more traffic flows. The configuration information 251 may, and in some embodiments does, include configuration information, e.g., parameters settings, that affect the operation of the uplink scheduler module 253, e.g., a priority, rate bound, latency bound, and/or sharing weight associated with one or more traffic flows. In some embodiments, scheduling and/or resource allocation operations performed by the uplink scheduler module 253 are additionally a function of channel conditions and other factors, e.g., power budget.<br><br>
[0039] The uplink PHY/MAC module 254 controls physical (PHY) layer and Media Access Control (MAC) layer processing relating to sending data information, e.g., messages, packets, and/or frames, via the wireless communication interface module 230, e.g., from the end node 200 to an access node. In some embodiments, operation of the uplink PHY/MAC module 254 includes both sending and receiving control information, e.g., signals or messages, to coordinate sending of data information, e.g., messages, packets, or frames. The configuration information 251 may, and in some embodiments does, include configuration information, e.g., parameters settings, that affect the operation of the uplink PHY/MAC module 254, e.g., a frequency, band, channel, spreading code or hoping code to be used for transmissions, an identifier associated with <br><br>
the end node 200, a request dictionary prescribing use of an assignment request channel, etc.<br><br>
[0040] The uplink LLC (ARQ) module 255 controls Logical Link Control (LLC) layer processing relating to sending data information, e.g., messages, packets, and/or frames, via the wireless communication interface module 230, e.g., from the end node 200 to an access node. The uplink LLC (ARQ) module 255 includes processing associated with Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ) capabilities, e.g., retransmission of lost packets or frames. In some embodiments, the uplink LLC (ARQ) module 255 further includes processing relating to the addition of an LLC header and/or trailer to higher layer messages, e.g., packets, to provide additional functionality, e.g., multiprotocol multiplexing/demultiplexing via a type field or error detection via a checksum field. The uplink LLC (ARQ) module 255 may also, and in some embodiments does, perform fragmentation of higher layer messages, e.g., packets, into multiple sub- portions, e.g., frames to be sent by the uplink PHY/MAC module 254. The configuration information 251 may, and in some embodiments does, include configuration information, e.g., parameters settings, that affect the operation of the uplink LLC (ARQ) module 255, e.g., an ARQ window size, maximum number of retransmissions, a discard timer, etc.<br><br>
[0041] The uplink queue management module 256 maintains information and controls processing relating to storage of data information, e.g., messages, packets, and/or frames, to be sent via the wireless communication interface module 230, e.g., from the end node 200 to an access node. The uplink queue management module 256 may, and in some embodiments does, control storage of data information awaiting transmission and maintain state information regarding data information awaiting transmission on a per traffic flow basis, e.g., packets associated with each traffic flow may be stored in separate queues. In some embodiments, the uplink queue management module 256 supports a variety of queue management techniques and/or capabilities, e.g., head drop, tail drop, as well as various Active Queue Management (AQM) mechanisms such as Random Early Detection (RED). The configuration information 251 may, and in some embodiments does, include configuration information, e.g., parameters settings, that affect the operation of the uplink queue management module 256, e.g., a queue limit, drop strategy, and/or AQM thresholds associated with one or more traffic flows. <br><br>

The Figure 4 end node 200 and Figure 4 access node 300 are simplified representations of the Figure 2 end node 200 and Figure 3 access node 300, respectively. The Figure 4 example shows an application module 214 sending 401 and receiving 417 data information, e.g., traffic flows comprising a sequence of messages, packets, or frames. In the context of the Figure 1 exemplary system, the Figure 4 end node 200 may be any one of the end nodes 144, 146, 144', 146', 146", 146" depicted Figure 1 and the application module 214 included in the Figure 4 end node 200 may be exchanging data information with another node in the system, e.g., another end node 144, 146, 144', 146', 146", 146" or the application server node 108 as depicted in Figure 1. In Figure 4 and the subsequent description, the node with which the <br><br>
Figure 4 end node 200 is exchanging data information is referred to as the corresponding node.<br><br>
[0063] The data information, e.g., traffic flows comprising a sequence of messages, packets, or frames, sent from the application module 214 in the end node 200 to a corresponding node is shown by a sequence of arrows 401, 402, 403, 404, 405 to proceed through a sequence of modules 257, 256, 255, 254 included in the end node 200 for processing, after which the data information is sent 405 from the end node 200 to the access node 300, e.g., via the wireless communication interface module 230.

[0064] The data information, e.g., traffic flows comprising a sequence of messages, packets, or frames, sent from a corresponding node to the application module 214 in the end node is shown by a sequence of arrows 410, 411, 412, 413, 414, 415 to be received by the access node 300, e.g., via the network/internetwork interface module 320, and then to proceed through a sequence of modules 359, 360, 361, 362, 363 included in the access node 300 for processing, after which the data information is sent 415 from the access node 300 to the end node 200, e.g., via the wireless communication interface module 330. Following reception 415 by the end node 200, e.g., via the wireless communication interface module 230, the data information, e.g., traffic flows comprising a sequence of messages, packets, or frames, sent from the corresponding node to the application module 214 in the end node 200 is shown by a sequence of arrows 415, 416, 417 to proceed through a sequence of modules 258, 259 included in the end node 200 for processing, prior to being delivered 417 to the application module 214 in the end 200. <br><br>
[0065] In addition to the exchange of data information, e.g., traffic flows, Fig 4. also depicts the exchange of control information, e.g., signaling flows and/or communication interfaces, represented by two headed arrows 420, 425, 430, 435, 450.

These exchanges of control information, e.g., signaling flows and/or communication interfaces, enable the configuration and/or operation of the traffic control modules 350/250 in both the access node 300 and the end node 200 to be affected by a) one or more additional nodes, e.g. the access control node 102 and/or application server node 108, b) the application module 214 in the end node 200, or c) a combination of one or more additional nodes and the application module 214 in the end node 200. Various embodiments may, and do, support all or only a subset of the depicted control information exchanges as needed.<br><br>
[0067] Figures 5 through 9 illustrate exemplary signaling performed in accordance with exemplary embodiments. Each of Figures 5 through 9 depicts an end node 200, which is a simplified representation of the Figure 2 exemplary end node 200 implemented in accordance with various embodiments. Similarly, access nodes 300, 300' depicted in Figures 5 through 9 are simplified representations of the Figure 3 <br><br>
exemplary access node 300 implemented in accordance with various embodiments. In each of Figures 5 through 9, the signaling is illustrated in the context of Figure 1 exemplary system 100. Thus, end node 200 in Figures 5 through 9 corresponds to any of the end nodes 144, 146, 144', 146', 144", 146" of the exemplary system 100, while access nodes 300, 300' in Figures 5 through 9 correspond to any of the access nodes 140, 140', 140" of the exemplary system 100. Figures 5 through 9 also depict various other network nodes (e.g., access control node 102, policy control node 106, and/or application server node 108) of the exemplary system 100 as needed for the purpose of illustrating the exemplary signaling.<br><br>
[0068] In Figures 5 through 9, the vertical solid line 501, 502, 503, 601, 602, 603, 604, 701, 702, 703, 704, 801, 802, 803, 804, 805, 901, 902, 903, extending below each depicted node represents a timeline for signals sent and/or received by the node, where time progresses "down" the timeline. Thus, portions of a timeline closer to the top of a figure represent earlier time than portions of a timeline closer to the bottom of the figure. Solid horizontal arrows 515, 520, 525, 610, 630, 635, 730, 735, 815, 850, 855, 910, 925 represent signals between nodes, with the arrowhead indicating direction from sender to receiver. Dashed horizontal arrow 615 represents alternative signals between nodes applicable in alternative scenarios, with the arrowhead indicating direction from sender to receiver. Dotted horizontal arrows 620, 625, 715, 720, 725, 820, 825, 835, 840, 845, 915, 920 represent optional signals between nodes used in some embodiments, with the arrowhead indicating direction from sender to receiver. Wide double-ended arrows 510, 510', 810, 830 represent groups of signals exchanged between nodes for some functional purpose. A signal is communicated to or from a particular node if the line representing such signal or group of signals indicates a dot at the vertical line representing said node in time. For example, referring to Figure 5, signal 515 is transmitted at time 515c by the access control 102 and is received by the access node 300 at time 515b. Figs 5 through 9 are subsequently described in detail.<br><br>

Figure 5 illustrates exemplary signaling performed in accordance with various embodiments, when an end node 200 is granted network access via an access node 300. In Figure 5, the end node 200 at point 510a sends a signal, part of the group of signals 510, to the access node 300 requesting network access. The access node 300 <br><br>
receives the signal, part of group of signals 510, at point 510b and sends another signal, part of group of signals 510' to the access control node 102, indicating a request for network access by the end node 200. The access control node 102 receives the signal, part of group of signals 510', at point 510c and performs operations, as needed to determine if network access should be granted to the end node 200. The end node 200, access node 300, and access control node 102 may, and in some embodiments do, exchange additional signals as part of the group of signals 510, 510' for the purpose of controlling network access, e.g., authentication and authorization. The access control node 102 at point 515c sends an access grant signal 515, e.g., message, to the access node 300, indicating that the end node 200 should be granted network access.<br><br>
[0070] In accordance with various embodiments, the access grant signal 515 may, and in some embodiments does, include information pertaining to quality of service treatment, e.g., specification of traffic flow identification criteria, a traffic flow profile, service requirements and/or service constraints, for one or more traffic flows. The access node 300 receives the access grant signal 515 at point 515b and performs operations as needed to grant network access to the end node 200 and determines the appropriate access node 300 and end node 200 configurations, e.g., settings for one or more adjustable modules and/or values for one or more adjustable parameters, as needed to provide quality of service to each identified traffic flow.<br><br>
[0071] The access node 300 at point 520b sends a configuration command signal 520, e.g., message, to the end node 200, instructing the end node 200 to implement a configuration operation corresponding to the configuration determined by the access node 300. In some embodiments, the configuration command signal 520 includes configuration information that enables the end node 200 to implement a configuration corresponding to one or more traffic flows e.g., to adjust the settings for one or more adjustable modules and/or adjust the values for one or more adjustable parameters. The configuration command signal instructs the end node 200 to, e.g., set the value of one or more internal parameters to parameter values determined by the access node 300; and/or set the value of one or more internal parameters to values determined by the end node 200 based on parameter values determined by the access node 300. The end node 200 receives the configuration command signal 520 at point 520a and performs a configuration operation in accordance with the configuration <br><br>
information provided by the configuration command signal 520. The end node 200 at point 525a sends a configuration response signal 525 to the access node 300, indicating that the configuration changes as instructed by the access node 300 have been completed by the end node 200.<br><br>
[0072] Exemplary Quality of Service support request related signaling and operations will now be described. Figure 6 illustrates exemplary signaling performed in accordance with various embodiments, when quality of service support for a traffic flow to or from an end node 200 is added, modified, or deleted by either the end node 200 or another network node, e.g., an application server node 108. In Figure 6, the end node 200 at point 610a sends a quality of service request signal 610 to the access node 300 requesting a change in quality of service support for one or more traffic flows. Figure 6 also illustrates an alternative quality of service request signal 615 that is applicable in an alternative scenario. In the exemplary alternative scenario, the application server node 108 at point 615c sends a quality of service request signal 615 to the access node 300 requesting a change in the quality of service support for one or more traffic flows to and/or from the end node 200. Thus, while the first quality of service request signal 610 illustrates the case where quality service support changes pertaining to traffic flows to and/or from the end node 200 are requested by the end node 200, the alternative quality of service request signal 615 illustrates the case where quality service support changes pertaining to traffic flows to and/or from the end node 200 are requested by another network node, e.g., the application server node 108.<br><br>
[0073] In accordance with various embodiments, the quality of service request signal 610 and/or the alternative quality of service request signal 615 may be, and is some embodiments is, used to request a variety of different quality of service support changes, e.g., add quality of service support for a new traffic flow, modify quality of service support of a previously known traffic flow, delete or terminate quality of service support of a previously known traffic flow. In each case, the quality of service request signal 610, 615 may, and in some embodiments does, include information pertaining to quality of service treatment, e.g., specification of traffic flow identification criteria, a traffic flow profile, service requirements and/or service constraints, for one or more traffic flows to and/or from the end node 200. When the access node 300 receives the quality of service request signal 610 at point 610b and/or the alternative quality of <br><br>
service request signal 615 at point 615b, the access node 300 initiates the process of determining whether the requested quality of service support changes will be supported and, if so, determining the appropriate access node 300 and end node 200 configurations, e.g., settings for one or more adjustable modules and/or values for one or more adjustable parameters, as needed to provide quality of service to each identified traffic flow.<br><br>
[0074] In accordance with various embodiments, the process of determining whether the requested quality of service support changes will be supported includes, e.g., making a resource admission control determination and/or making a policy control determination. As part of determining whether the requested quality of service support changes will be supported, the access node 300 may, and in some embodiments does, exchange signaling 620, 625 with a policy control node 106, e.g., a network node functioning as a policy decision point. Figure 6 illustrates this optional policy control signaling exchange 620, 625. In Figure 6, the access node 300 at point 620b sends a policy decision request signal 620 to the policy control node 106 requesting a policy decision corresponding to the requested quality of service support changes. The policy control node 106 receives the policy decision request signal 620 at point 62Od and performs a policy check, e.g., determines if requested quality of service support changes are authorized for the end node 200 and/or correspond to a valid application layer session. The policy control node 106 at point 625d send a policy decision response signal 625 to the access node 300, indicating whether the requested quality of service changes are approved. The access node 300 receives the policy decision response signal 625 at point 625b.<br><br>
[0075] Given that the required resource admission control checks and/or policy control checks have passed, the access node 300 at point 630b sends a configuration command signal 630, e.g., message, to the end node 200, instructing the end node 200 to implement a configuration operation corresponding to the configuration determined by the access node 300. In some embodiments, the configuration command signal 630 includes configuration information that enables the end node 200 to implement a configuration corresponding to one or more traffic flows e.g., to adjust the settings for one or more adjustable modules and/or adjust the values for one or more adjustable parameters. The configuration command signal instructs the end node 200 to, e.g., set <br><br>
the value of one or more internal parameters to parameter values determined by the access node 300; and/or set the value of one or more internal parameters to values determined by the end node 200 based on parameter values determined by the access node 300. The end node 200 receives the configuration command signal 630 at point 630a and performs a configuration operation in accordance with the configuration information provided by the configuration command signal 630. The end node 200 at point 635a sends a configuration response signal 635 to the access node 300, indicating that the configuration changes as instructed by the access node 300 have been completed by the end node 200.<br><br>
[0076] Exemplary Quality of Service support revocation signaling and related operations will now be described. Figure 7 illustrates exemplary signaling performed in accordance with various embodiments, when quality of service support for a traffic flow to or from an end node 200 is revoked by an access node 300. In Figure 7, the highest dot 710b on the access node 300 timeline 702 represents a time at which quality of service support for one or more traffic flows to and/or from the end node 200 is being terminated by the access node 300. Termination of quality of service support for one or more traffic flows to and/or from the end node 200 at the indicated time 710b can correspond to a variety of different events, scenarios, and/or conditions, e.g., preemption by the access node 300 in favor of supporting another higher priority traffic flow to and/or from the same or a different end node, inability of the access node 300 to continue providing the required service due to degradation of access link, expiry of authorization or another policy constraint. When terminating quality of service support for a traffic flow, the access node 300 may, and in some embodiments does, send a revocation notification signal 715, 720, 725 to one or more network nodes. Figure 7 illustrates this optional revocation notification signaling 715, 720, 725. In Figure 7, the access node 300 sends a revocation notification signal 715 to the end node 200 at point 715b, a revocation notification signal 720 to the application server node 108 at point 720b, and a revocation notification signal 725 to the policy control node 106 at point 725b, in each case indicating that quality of service support for one or more traffic flows to and/or from the end node 200 have been terminated. The end node 200 receives its revocation notification signal 715 at point 715a, the application server node 108 receives its revocation notification signal 720 at point 720c, and the policy control node 106 receives its revocation notification signal 725 at point 725 d. In each case, upon reception <br><br>
of the revocation notification signal 715, 720, 725 the respective receiving node performs additional operations as needed, e.g., deletion of internal state corresponding to the terminated quality of service support, logging of the event, etc.<br><br>
[0077] In accordance with various embodiments, upon terminating quality of service support for one or more traffic flows at the indicated time 710b, the access node 300 determines the appropriate access node 300 and end node 200 configurations, e.g., settings for one or more adjustable modules and/or values for one or more adjustable parameters, as needed to reflect termination of quality of service support for one ore more identified traffic flows. The access node 300 at point 730b sends a configuration command signal 730, e.g., message, to the end node 200, instructing the end node 200 to implement a configuration operation corresponding to the configuration determined by the access node 300. In some embodiments, the configuration command signal 730 includes configuration information that enables the end node 200 to implement a configuration corresponding to one or more traffic flows e.g., to adjust the settings for one or more adjustable modules and/or adjust the values for one or more adjustable parameters. The configuration command signal instructs the end node 200 to, e.g., set the value of one or more internal parameters to parameter values determined by the access node 300; and/or set the value of one or more internal parameters to values determined by the end node 200 based on parameter values determined by the access node 300. The end node 200 receives the configuration command signal 730 at point 730a and performs a configuration operation in accordance with the configuration information provided by the configuration command signal 730. The end node 200 at point 735a sends a configuration response signal 735 to the access node 300, indicating that the configuration changes as instructed by the access node 300 have been completed by the end node 200.<br><br>
[0078] An exemplary changing of a point of network attachment will now be described. Figure 8 illustrates exemplary signaling performed in accordance with various embodiments, when an end node 200 changes its point of attachment to the network from a first access node 300 to a second access node 300'. In Figure 8, the initial condition is assumed to be one wherein the end node 200 has an existing link with the first access node 300 through which the end node 200 may send/receive traffic flows, e.g., the condition that exists at the end of the time sequence depicted in Figure 5. The <br><br>
end node 200 at point 810a sends a signal, part of the group of signals 810, to the second access node 300' initiating establishment of a new link to the second access node 300'. The second access node 300' receives the signal, part of group of signals 810, at point 810b and performs further operations as needed to establish a link with the end node 200. The details regarding establishment of a new link may differ in various embodiments. For example, signaling may be exchanged with or relayed by other nodes, e.g., the first access node 300, and/or the existing link with the first access node 300 may be terminated prior to establishing the new link with the second access node 300'.<br><br>
[0079] In conjunction with establishment of the new link, the first access node 300 at point 815b sends a context transfer signal 815 to the second access node 300'. In accordance with the various embodiments, the context transfer signal 815 may, and in some embodiments does, include information pertaining to quality of service treatment, e.g., specification of traffic flow identification criteria, a traffic flow profile, service requirements and/or service constraints, for one or more traffic flows. The second access node 300' receives the context transfer signal 815 at point 815c and initiates the process of determining whether the quality of service treatment as indicated by the context transfer signal 815 will be supported and, if so, determining the appropriate access node 300' and end node 200 configurations, e.g., settings for one or more adjustable modules and/or values for one or more adjustable parameters, as needed to provide quality of service to each identified traffic flow. In accordance with various embodiments, the process of determining whether the indicated quality of service treatment will be supported includes, e.g., making a resource admission control determination and/or making a policy control determination.<br><br>
[0080] In some embodiments, if the second access node 300' determines that additional or alternative configuration of the end node 200 is required, e.g., due to the admission or non-admission of various traffic flows, then the second access node 300' may exchange configuration signaling 820, 825 with the end node 200 at this point. Figure 8 illustrates this optional configuration signaling exchange 820, 825. The second access node 300' at point 820c sends a configuration command signal 820, e.g., message, to the end node 200, instructing the end node 200 to implement a configuration operation corresponding to the configuration determined by the second access node 300'. In some embodiments, the configuration command signal 820 includes configuration information <br><br>
that enables the end node 200 to implement a configuration corresponding to one or more traffic flows e.g., to adjust the settings for one or more adjustable modules and/or adjust the values for one or more adjustable parameters. The configuration command signal instructs the end node 200 to, e.g., set the value of one or more internal parameters to parameter values determined by the second access node 300', and/or set the value of one or more internal parameters to values determined by the end node 200 based on parameter values determined by the second access node 300'. The end node 200 receives the configuration command signal 820 at point 820a and performs a configuration operation in accordance with the configuration information provided by the configuration command signal 820. The end node 200 at point 825 a sends a configuration response signal 825 to the second access node 300', indicating that the configuration changes as instructed by the second access node 300' have been completed by the end node 200.<br><br>
[0081] Note that at this point in the Figure 8 exemplary signaling diagram, while a link with the second access node 300' has been established, the original link with the first access node 300 may be either dropped or maintained for an arbitrary duration of time. Also, note that while signaling 830 to redirect traffic flows destined to the end node 200 via the second access router 300' (e.g., by updating routing/forwarding information) has not yet occurred, in some systems, it may be possible for the end node 200 to already send traffic flows via the link with the second access node 300'. Thus, the configuration signaling 820, 825 already exchanged with the end node 200 may, and in some embodiments does, pertain primarily to traffic flows sent from the end node 200, while configuration signaling 850, 855 pertaining to traffic flows destined to the end node 200 may be, and is some embodiments is, delayed until after the signaling 830 associated with redirecting traffic flows destined to the end node 200 (e.g., updating routing/forwarding information). As illustrated in the Figure 8 exemplary signaling diagram, the end node 200 at point 830a sends a signal, part of the group of signals 830 to the second access node 300' to redirect routing/forwarding of traffic flows destined to the end node 200 via the second access node 300' (e.g., to update routing/forwarding information). The second access node 300' receives the signal, part of group of signals 830, at point 830c and performs operations as needed to update routing/forwarding information in various network nodes. Note that the process of updating routing/forwarding information may, and in some embodiments does, involve the <br><br>
exchange of additional signaling with other network nodes, e.g., the first access node 300.<br><br>
[0082] Given that one or more traffic flows previously supported at the first access node 300 may not be admitted at the second access node 300', the second access node 300' may, and in some embodiments does, send a revocation notification signal 835, 840, 845 to one or more network nodes. Figure 8 illustrates this optional revocation notification signaling 835, 840, 845. In Figure 8, the second access node 300' sends a revocation notification signal 835 to the end node 200 at point 835c, a revocation notification signal 840 to the application server node 108 at point 840c, and a revocation notification signal 845 to the policy control node 106 at point 845c, in each case indicating that quality of service support for one or more traffic flows to and/or from the end node 200 have been terminated. The end node 200 receives its revocation notification signal 835 at point 835a, the application server node 108 receives its revocation notification signal 840 at point 84Od, and the policy control node 106 receives its revocation notification signal 845 at point 845e. In each case, upon reception of the revocation notification signal 835, 840, 845 the respective receiving node performs additional operations as needed, e.g., deletion of internal state corresponding to the terminated quality of service support, logging of the event, etc.<br><br>
[0083] Assuming that second access node 300' determined that additional or alternative configuration of the end node 200 is required, e.g., due to the admission or non-admission of various traffic flows, the second access node 300' at point 850c sends a configuration command signal 850, e.g., message, to the end node 200, instructing the end node 200 to implement a configuration operation corresponding to the configuration determined by the second access node 300'. In some embodiments, the configuration command signal 850 includes configuration information that enables the end node 200 to implement a configuration corresponding to one or more traffic flows e.g., to adjust the settings for one or more adjustable modules and/or adjust the values for one or more adjustable parameters. The configuration command signal instructs the end node 200 to, e.g., set the value of one or more internal parameters to parameter values determined by the second access node 300', and/or set the value of one or more internal parameters to values determined by the end node 200 based on parameter values determined by the second access node 300'. The end node 200 receives the configuration command signal <br><br>
850 at point 850a and performs a configuration operation in accordance with the configuration information provided by the configuration command signal 850. The end node 200 at point 855a sends a configuration response signal 855 to the second access node 300', indicating that the configuration changes as instructed by the second access node 300' have been completed by the end node 200.<br><br>
[0084] An exemplary reduced signaling Quality of Service Support Request will now be described. Figure 9 illustrates exemplary signaling performed in accordance with various embodiments, when quality of service support for a traffic flow to and/or from an end node 200 is added, modified, or deleted by the end node 200. The exemplary signaling diagram depicted in Figure 9 is an alternative to what is shown in Figure 6 for the case where a quality of service support request 610, 910 is initiated by the end node 200. In Figure 9, the end node 200 at point 910a sends a quality of service request signal 910 to the access node 300 requesting a change in quality of service support for one or more traffic flows. The quality of service request signal 910 may be, and is some embodiments is, used to request a variety of different quality of service support changes, e.g., add quality of service support for a new traffic flow, modify quality of service support of a previously known traffic flow, delete or terminate quality of service support of a previously known traffic flow. In each case, the quality of service request signal 910 may, and in some embodiments does, include information pertaining to quality of service treatment, e.g., specification of traffic flow identification criteria, a traffic flow profile, service requirements and/or service constraints, for one or more traffic flows to and/or from the end node 200. Furthermore, in the Figure 9 example, the quality of service request signal 910 may, and in some embodiments does, define and/or imply access node 300 and end node 200 configurations as needed to provide the requested quality of service support, e.g., settings for one or more adjustable modules and/or values for one or more adjustable parameters, as needed to provide quality of service to each identified traffic flow. When the access node 300 receives the quality of service request signal 910 at point 910b, the access node 300 initiates the process of determining whether the requested quality of service support changes will be supported and, if so, whether the access node 300 and end node 200 configurations defined or implied by the quality of service request signal, e.g., proposed by the end node 200, are acceptable to the access node 300. <br><br>
[0085] In accordance with various embodiments, the process of determining whether the requested quality of service support changes will be supported includes, e.g., making a resource admission control determination and/or making a policy control determination. As part of determining whether the requested quality of service support changes will be supported, the access node 300 may, and in some embodiments does, exchange signaling 915, 920 with a policy control node 106, e.g., a network node functioning as a policy decision point. Figure 9 illustrates this optional policy control signaling exchange 915,920. In Figure 6, the access node 300 at point 915b sends a policy decision request signal 915 to the policy control node 106 requesting a policy decision corresponding to the requested quality of service support changes. The policy control node 106 receives the policy decision request signal 915 at point 915c and performs a policy check, e.g., determines if requested quality of service support changes are authorized for the end node 200 and/or correspond to a valid application layer session. The policy control node 106 at point 920c send a policy decision response signal 920 to the access node 300, indicating whether the requested quality of service changes are approved. The access node 300 receives the policy decision response signal 920 at point 920b.<br><br>
[0086] Given that the required resource admission control checks and/or policy control checks have passed and configurations defined or implied by the quality of service request signal, e.g., proposed by the end node 200, are acceptable to the access node 300, the access node 300 at point 925b sends a configuration command signal 925, e.g., message, to the end node 200, instructing the end node 200 to implement a configuration operation corresponding to the configurations defined or implied by the quality of service request signal 910. The configuration command signal 925 instructs the end node 200 to, e.g., set the value of one or more internal parameters to parameter values proposed by the end node 200 in the quality of service request signal 910 and determined to be acceptable by the access node 300. The end node 200 receives the configuration command signal 925 at point 925 a and performs a configuration operation in accordance with the configuration defined or implied by the quality of service request signal 910. Alternatively, if the required resource admission control checks and/or policy control checks have failed and/or the configurations defined or implied by the quality of service request signal, e.g., proposed by the end node 200, are not acceptable to the access node 300, the configuration command signal 925 sent by the access node 300 <br><br>
instructs the end node 200 to abandon the configurations defined or implied by the quality of service request signal, e.g., proposed by the end node 200.<br><br>
[0087] Figure 10 is a drawing of a flowchart 1000 of an exemplary method of operating an access node, e.g., base station, in accordance with various embodiments. Operation starts in step 1002 where the access node is powered on and initialized. Operation proceeds from start step 1002 to step 1004. In step 1004, the access node receives a signal indicating a quality of service requirement for a traffic flow. Operation proceeds from step 1004 to step 1006. In step 1006, the access node receives a signal providing traffic flow profile information for said traffic flow. Operation proceeds from step 1006 to step 1007. While in the illustrated embodiment both steps 1004 and 1006 are included, in some embodiments one but not necessarily both steps 1004 and 1006 are performed. When one but not both steps 1004 and 1006 are performed, the omitted step is skipped.<br><br>
[0088] In step 1007, the access node makes a flow admission control determination, said admission control determination including determining if sufficient resources are available at said access node to support said traffic flow at a particular quality of service level. In some embodiments, the particular quality of service level that is taken into consideration is a level that is requested by the wireless terminal, e.g., in step 1004. Operation proceeds from step 1007 to step 1008.<br><br>
[0089] In step 1008, the access node determines wireless terminal configuration parameters corresponding to said traffic flow. In some embodiments, the determining of step 1008 includes determining wireless terminal configuration parameters required to satisfy said indicated quality of service requirement. In some embodiments, the determining of step 1008 includes determining wireless terminal configuration parameters required to support a traffic flow having the indicated traffic flow profile. Operation proceeds from step 1008 to step 1010.<br><br>
[0090] In step 1010, the access node sets an uplink scheduling parameter used by the access node in assigning uplink communications resources to said wireless terminal. In some embodiments, the uplink communications resources are uplink traffic channel segments and said uplink traffic channel segments are assigned as a function of <br><br>
a latency requirement corresponding to said traffic flow. Operation proceeds from step 1010 to step 1012. While Fig. 10 shows an exemplary method being used with uplink flows, some embodiments are applied simply to downlink flows in which case step 1010 would be skipped. In step 1012, the access node sets in said access node an automatic request parameter corresponding to said traffic flow, said setting being used to control a discard timer used to control discarding of received information. Operation proceeds from step 1012 to step 1014. In step 1014, the access node sets in said access node an automatic request setting corresponding to said traffic flow, said setting being used to control retransmission of at least some data units in said traffic flow. Operation proceeds from step 1014 to step 1018. It should be appreciated that steps 1012 and 1014 may be implemented as optional steps and that in some embodiments these steps are skipped. In the case where the automatic request setting corresponds to an uplink flow, in step 1014, the access node may transmit the automatic request setting to, e.g., a wireless terminal, which can then use the setting to control uplink retransmissions. In such embodiments, the access node has knowledge of the repeat transmission setting and can take the setting into account while the wireless terminal implements uplink transmissions in accordance with the communicated setting.<br><br>
[0091] In step 1018, where the access node sends the wireless terminal a dictionary indicator indicating which one of a plurality of uplink request signal definition dictionaries should be used when sending an uplink resource request. Operation proceeds from step 1018 to step 1020.<br><br>
[0092] In step 1020, the access node communicates a configuration command instructing said wireless terminal to implement a configuration operation corresponding to at least one determined configuration parameter. In various embodiments, the step of communicating a configuration command includes transmitting said command to said wireless terminal over a wireless communications link. In various embodiments, said configuration command instructs the wireless terminal to perform at least one of : i) setting an internal parameter value determined by said access node; and ii) setting an internal parameter to a value determined by said wireless terminal based on a parameter determined by said access node. In some embodiments, said configuration command instructs said wireless terminal to perform an automatic repeat request configuration <br><br>
operation corresponding to said traffic flow. In some embodiments, said configuration command instructs the wireless terminal to set a request group corresponding to said traffic flow. In some embodiments, communicating a configuration command includes instructing said wireless terminal to set a minimum communication rate corresponding to said traffic flow. In some embodiments, communicating a configuration command includes instructing said wireless terminal to set a sharing weight corresponding to said traffic flow. In some embodiments, communicating a configuration command includes instructing said wireless terminal to store latency tolerance information specified by said access node for said traffic flow. In some embodiments, communicating a configuration command includes instructing said wireless terminal to store loss tolerance information specified by said access node for said traffic flow. In some embodiments, communicating a configuration command includes instructing said wireless terminal to set a minimum communications rate, latency tolerance and loss tolerance specified by said access node for said traffic flow. In some embodiments, the configuration command instructs the wireless terminal to set a scheduling parameter used to schedule transmission of data units corresponding to said flow. In some embodiments, the configuration command instructs the wireless terminal to set an automatic repeat request setting corresponding to said traffic flow, said setting being used to control retransmission of at least some data units in said traffic flow. In some embodiments, the configuration command instructs the wireless terminal to set an automatic repeat request parameter corresponding to said traffic flow, said setting being used to control a discard timer used to control discarding of received information. In some embodiments, said configuration command instructs the wireless terminal to set classifier parameters used to identify data units corresponding to said traffic flow. It should be appreciated that, depending on the embodiment, step 1018 may be implemented as part of step 1020 and need not be implemented as a separate step. Operation proceeds from step 1020 to step 1022.<br><br>
[0093] In step 1022, the access node determines wireless terminal configuration parameters corresponding to an additional traffic flow corresponding to said wireless terminal. This may be in response to, e.g., an additional signal received by the access node. In some embodiments, said step of determining wireless terminal configuration parameters corresponding to said additional traffic flow is performed while said traffic flow is ongoing. Operation proceeds from step 1022 to step 1024. In step 1024, the <br><br>
access node communicates an additional configuration command instructing said wireless terminal to implement an additional configuration operation corresponding to at least one additional determined configuration parameter. While shown as additional steps, steps 1022, 1024 may be implemented as part of an ongoing process of receiving and processing signals, e.g., with these steps being implemented by iterating through steps 1004 through 1022 as part of processing an additional signal.<br><br>
[0094] Figure 11 is a flowchart 1100 of an exemplary method of operating a wireless terminal, e.g., mobile node, in accordance with various embodiments. Operation of the exemplary method starts in step 1102, where the wireless terminal is powered on and initialized. Operation proceeds from start step 1102 to step 1104. In step 1104, the wireless terminal receives a message including configuration information associated with a traffic flow, e.g., an uplink traffic flow, said configuration information including: transmission scheduling information, latency information, link sharing information, and automatic repeat request information. In some embodiments a plurality of messages are used to communicate configuration information associated with a traffic flow. It should be appreciated that depending on the embodiment, the received message or messages may apply to multiple flows in which case, processing may be performed with respect to each of the flows to which a message applies. Operation proceeds from step 1104 to step 1106.<br><br>
[0095] In step 1106, the wireless terminal implements a configuration operation or operations using said received configuration information. Step 1106 includes sub- steps 1108, 1110, 1112, 1114, 1116, and 1118. In sub-step 1108, the wireless terminal sets a traffic flow classifier parameter to a value specified by said received configuration information. Operation proceeds from sub-step 1108 to sub-step 1110. In sub-step 1110, the wireless terminal performs a traffic classification operation on traffic to be classified using said traffic classifier to identify traffic corresponding to said traffic flow. While shown as part of the configuration processing of step 1106, it should be appreciated that traffic classification sub-step 1110 may, and often is, implemented as part of a data processing operation, e.g., after one or more configuration operations have been performed. Accordingly, the placement of sub-step 1110 within the overall method may vary depending on the particular embodiment. <br><br>
[0096] In sub-step 1112, the wireless terminal sets a transmission control parameter as a function of said received configuration information. In sub-step 1114, the wireless terminal sets a transmission control parameter, which affects transmission latency, as a function of said received latency information. In sub-step 1116, the wireless terminal sets a transmission control parameter, affecting transmission resource sharing between traffic flows, as a function of said received link sharing information. In sub-step 1118, the wireless terminal sets a transmission control parameter, affecting automatic repeat request operation, as a function of said received automatic repeat request information. It should be appreciated that many of the substeps found in step 1106 are optional and, depending on the embodiment, various substeps may be omitted or performed at a different point within the method. For example sub-steps 1114, 1116. 1118 may be implemented as part of sub-step 1112.<br><br>
[0097] Operation proceeds from step 1106 to step 1120. In step 1120, the wireless terminal stores traffic identified by said traffic classification operation in a queue corresponding to said traffic flow. While shown following step 1106, it should be appreciated that step 1120 would normally be implemented as a data processing operation and may be performed at various points in time, e.g., after one or more configuration operations relating to a flow have been performed. Operation proceeds from step 1120 to step 1122. In step 1122, the wireless terminal sets a transmission scheduling control parameter used to control the transmission of data units from said queue as a function of said received transmission scheduling information. In some embodiments, the transmission scheduling control parameter is a link sharing weight. Operation proceeds from step 1122 to step 1124. Step 1122 may be skipped or omitted in embodiments where such configuration operations are performed in one of the substeps of step 1106.<br><br>
[0098] In step 1124, the wireless terminal receives a message including configuration information associated with an additional traffic flow. Operation proceeds from step 1124 to step 1126. In step 1126, the wireless terminal implements an additional configuration operation using said received additional configuration information. In some embodiments, implementing an additional configuration operation is performed while said traffic flow is ongoing. While shown as additional steps, steps 1124, 1026 may be implemented as part of an ongoing process of receiving and <br><br>
processing signals, e.g., with these steps being implemented by iterating through steps 1104 through 1122 as part of processing an additional signal.<br><br>
[0099] In some embodiments, said received configuration message of step 1104 includes at least one of said transmission scheduling information, latency information, link sharing information, and automatic request information but does not include each of said transmission scheduling information, latency information, link sharing information, and automatic request information. In some such embodiments, at least one of: sub-step 1108, sub-step 1110, sub-step 1112, sub-step 1114, sub-step 1116, sub-step 1118, step 1120 and step 1122 is performed, but each of 1108, sub-step 1110, sub-step 1112, sub- step 1114, sub-step 1116, sub-step 1118, step 1120 and step 1122 is not performed corresponding to the received message.<br><br>

At some times, the configuration command instructs the wireless terminal to perform an automatic repeat request configuration operation corresponding to a traffic flow. At some times, the configuration command instructs a wireless terminal to set a request group corresponding to a traffic flow.<br><br>
[00104] I/O interface 1210 couples the base station to other network nodes, e.g., other base stations, routers, access control nodes, mobility support nodes, policy control nodes, application server nodes, and/or the Internet. I/O interface 1210 by coupling the base station 1200 to a backhaul network allows a wireless terminal using a base station 1200 attachment point to participate in a communications session with a peer node using an attachment point of a different base station.

[00106] The parameter determination module 1228 determines wireless terminal configuration parameters corresponding to a traffic flow. At some times, the parameter determination module 1228 determines wireless terminal configuration parameters required to satisfy an indicated quality of service requirement. The dictionary selection module 1230 selects a dictionary for a wireless terminal and generates a message to be sent to the wireless terminal and controls sending of the message, said message including a dictionary indicator indicating which one of a plurality of uplink request signal definition dictionaries should by used by the wireless terminal when sending an uplink resource request to the base station.

ARQ module 1240 performs various ARQ operations corresponding to traffic flows. The ARQ module 1240 uses automatic repeat request parameters set by the access node corresponding to a traffic flow in performing ARQ operations, e.g., a set parameter <br><br>
being used to control a discard timer used to control discarding of received information and/or a set parameter used to control retransmission of at least some data units in the traffic flow. Configuration command module 1242 generates configuration command messages to be communicated to wireless terminals.

[00110] Received QoS requirement information 1264 and received traffic flow profile information 1266 includes information received corresponding to WT 1 and traffic flow 1. It should be appreciated that for some traffic flows both QoS requirement information 1264 and traffic flow profile information 1266 may not be used, e.g., with a single one of these pieces of information being available and being used for a particular traffic flow. The received information may be obtained via wireless receiver module 1204 and/or I/O interface module 1210, e.g., depending on the source. For example, a WT 1 may request a change in quality of service corresponding to one or more flows and send the signal via wireless receiver module 1204.

[00113] Figure 13 is a drawing of an exemplary wireless terminal 1300, e.g., mobile node, implemented in accordance with various embodiments. Exemplary wireless terminal 1300 may be any of the exemplary end nodes of the exemplary system <br><br>
100 of Figure 1. Exemplary wireless terminal 1300 includes a receiver module 1302, a transmitter module 1304, a processor 1306, I/O devices 1308, and a memory 1310 coupled together via a bus 1312 over which the various elements may interchange data and information. The memory 1310 includes routines 1318 and data/information 1320. The processor 1306, e.g., a CPU, executes the routines 1318 and uses the data/information 1320 in memory 1310 to control the operation of the wireless terminal 1300 and implement methods.<br><br>

While shown as elements within configuration control module 1326, modules 1328 and 1330 may be implemented as separate modules as opposed to being part of a larger configuration control module 1326.<br><br>

Set traffic flow classifier parameter information 1360 is an output of module 1328. The traffic classifier module 1330 performs traffic classification operations on traffic to be classified using the traffic flow classifier to identify traffic corresponding to the traffic flow.

[00120] Traffic storage module 1334 stores traffic, identified by a traffic classification operation, in a queue corresponding to the traffic flow. Thus traffic storage module 1334 is responsive to the traffic classifier module 1330, e.g., storing identified traffic flow 1 data/information 1382 in queue 1384. Receiver control module <br><br>
1336 control operations of receiver module 1302, while transmitter control module 1338 controls operations of transmitter module 1304.<br><br>
