				<td>The present invention relates to a shock wave generating method and device and, more particularly, to a method and device for repeatedly generating shock waves in an injection well borehole to increase oil recovery and oil production and to carry out the continuous seismic survey of oil an bearing formulation<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
Seismic surveys, taken at different stages in the life of an oil field, are used to locate pockets of hydrocarbons. These types of surveys are generally referred to as 4-D seismic surveys which incorporate data relating to depth, width, length and time. Problems have been encountered because of the lack of compatibility of surveys performed at various times, .analysis of the data is expensive and often unreliable.<br>
In conducting seismic surveys, energy is released that travels through the each in the form of vibrations called seismic waves. The seismic waves move in all directions and gradually STOW weaker as the distance increases from the source.<br>
There are two kinds of seismic waves. Body waves, the fastest seismic waves, move through the earth. Body waves may be compression waves or shear<br><br>
waves. As the waves pass through the earth, they cause particles of rock to move in different ways. Compressional waves push and pull  the rock. Shear waves make rocks move from side to side. Compressional waves can travel through solids, liquids, or gasses, but shear waves can pass only through solids, Compressional waves are the fastest seismic waves and are often referred to as primary waves. Shear waves travel slower and are referred to as secondary waves. Seismograph instruments are equipped with sensors called seismometers that can detect ground motions caused by seismic waves. A seismograph produces wavy lines that reflect the size of seismic waves passing beneath it. The record of the wave, called a seismogram, is printed on paper, film or recording tape or is stored and displayed by computers.<br>
A need exists for a controllable source of seismic energy for use in 4-D seismic mapping which provides compatible data for use in 4-D seismic mapping. Further, a long felt need exists for a source of seismic energy which is controlled so that it can be "fine-tuned" to a particular formation to province optimum performance in stimulating production of hydrocarbons.<br>
Seismic or elastic wave stimulation is a known technique for enhancing oil recovery from an oil bearing bed as described in "Elastic-Wave StinuiLulon of Oil Production: A Review of Methods and Results," Geophysics Vol. z"-J, So. 6 (June 1994).<br>
Various devices for impawning a shock wave to a well are known in the patented prior art. The Russian Federation Patent No. 1,710,709, for example, discloses a method and apparatus in which an anvil plate is arranged at the bottom of the well and a heavy weight in the form of water filled tubing is  lifted and dropped onto the anvil plate, thereby imparting vibrations to "the oil bed. However, the repeated impact of the weight eventually destroys the bottom of the well. The amount of damage can be minimized by limiting the impact force applied to the anvi! plate, but this lowers the power of the elastic waves which reduces efficiency.   In addition, the efficiency of this method is limited by a low<br><br>
energy transfer coefficient of the potential energy of the weight into the energy of the elastic waves.<br>
Castro USSR Patent No. 1,674,597, granted May 1, 1991 discloses a well hydro-acoustic generator comprising a frame with inlets and outlets, a conical nozzle, a resonant diaphragm and a conical deflector. The conical deflector has a particular angle providing optimum reflection of waves created by the generator and the resonant diaphragm such that the whole energy of (he wave h transferred into the direction of the casing wall.<br>
The U. S. Patent 0 Vagin No, 5,586,602 discloses a method and apparatus for increasing the effectiveness of shock wave stimulation of oil-bearing formations which includes a pumping unit arranged at the wellhead, a tubing string which extends downwardly into the production casing of the well, a stuffing box arranged on top of the tubing string, a cylinder connected weigh the bottom of the tubing string, and a plunger which reciprocates up and down within the tubing string and cylinder. As the plunger moves upwardly, the fluid in the tubing string is compressed. At Ihe lop of the pumping unit upstroke, the plunger exits the top of the cylinder so that the fluid in the tubing string is discharged into the production casing, thereby generating a shock wave. Aithough this method achieves higher efficiency than the method described in the Russian Patent No. 1,710,709 discussed above, it is limited in terms of its reliability, effectiveness and efficiency because (1) a cement/bridge plug must be installed to pressurize the borehole. (2) the pressure on the front of the shock wave must be limited due to the low reliability of the stuffing box undergoing a high periodic pressure, (3) additional surface equipment must be used to compensate for liquid leaking through the stuffing box, casing, cement plug, and other equipment, and (4} it is unable io   shock wave near the bottom hole for wells having a depth of greater khan SOO-IOQO feet.<br>
Wagner et al U. S. Patent No. 5,S36,3S9 discloses a conical-shaped difffuser-defleclor which is described as being positioned such that as the wave impacts the diffuser-deflector, the wave is partially deflected in an outward direction and at least a portion of the impulse wave continues down-hole, to impact a bridge plug.<br><br>
As the wave deflects offof the bridge plug, weak elastic waves are then maintained in a lower area of the well by a packer and the diffuser-deflector.<br>
Roberts U. S. Patent No. 5, 950,726 discloses well stimulation apparatus which employs an underground casing which provides a sealed vessel in which is supported a tubing string. The casing the tubing string are filled with a working fluid and a pumping unit reciprocates a plunger within the tubing string to cyclically pressurize and depressurize the working fluid for creating elastic wave energy. A hollow conical projector is supported at the lower end of a pump barrel to amplify and direct energy waves. Working fluid substantially fills the tubing assembly and the sealed vessel formed by the well head, the casing and a bridge plug installed above perforations in a live or abandoned well.<br>
Vagin Patent No. 5,586,602, Wagner et al Patent No. 5,836,389 and Roberts Patent No. 5,950,726 disclose processes which require that the well he completely filled with liquid and sealed for forming a closed system.<br>
The present invention was developed to overcome these and other drawbacks of the prior devices by providing an improved method and apparatus fof producing an elastic shock wave in a borehole which includes pumping means arranged at the wellhead, a tubing string extending downwardly into the production casing of the well, a hollow cylinder assembly connected wig[h the bottom of the tubing string, and a pair of plungers arranged within the cylinder assembly for com]dressing liquid contained within the cylinder assembly and discharging the compressed liquid into the production casing, thereby generating a shock wave.<br>
SUMMARY OF lineation<br>
Accordingly, primary object of a first embodiment of the present invention is to provide an apparatus for producing a shock wave in a borehole, silica as a well, which includes a pumping unit arranged at the wellhead, a tubing string extending downwardly into the production casing of the well, a hollow cylinder assembly connected with the bottom of the tubing siring, and a pair of plungers arranged within the cylinder assembly and connected with the pumping unit \\"h\\ sucker rods<br><br>
and a polish rod for compressing liquid contained within the cylinder assembly and discharging the compressed liquid into the production casing, thereby generating a shock wave. The cylinder assembly includes a hollow upper cylinder, a hollow lower cylinder arranged below the upper cylinder, a crossover cylinder arranged between the upper and lower cylinders, and a compression cylinder containing a compression chamber arranged behaved the crossover cylinder and the tipper cylinder. The lower cylinder has a larger inner diameter than the upper cylinder and the lower plunger has a larger diameter than the upper plunger. In addition, the internal! bore of the lower cylinder is adapted to receive the lower plunger, and the internal bore of the upper cylinder is adapted to receive the upper plunder. Twine the plungers are displaced upwardly in the cylinder assembly, the lower plunger travels into the compression chamber and the upper plunger travels otu of the compression chamber. Due to the lower plunger having a greater diameter than the upper plunger, the volume of the compression chamber is reduced and the liquid contained therein becomes compressed. When the pumping unit reaches the top of its stroke, the lower plunger allows the compressed liquid contain^-"d in (he compression chamber to be discharged info the we!!.<br>
It is another object of the invention to provide an apparatus for producing a shock wave in a borehole in which the lower plunger includes an upper portion having a generally smooth outer perimeter which creates a generally liquid light interface between the lower plunger and the lower cylinder, and a lower portion containing a plurality of flow channels which allow liquid to flow past the lower plunger into the lower cylinder when the lower portion of the plunger is disabled beyond the lower cylinder. In addition, the lower plunger includes an oatmeal bore and a ball for selectively allowing the passage of liquid upwardly through the lower plunger into the compression chamber when the lower plunger is displaced downwardly.<br>
It is a farther object of the present invention to provide
 <br>
cylinder assembly with a liquid, providing a pair of plungers in the cylinder assembly, and displacing the plungers to compress the liquid contained in Ihe cylinder assembly and discharge the liquid into the borehole.<br>
In operation, the first embodiment of the apparatus is installed in a borehole so that the hydrostatic fluid level in the well is higher than the top of the upper cylinder. The motion of the pumping unit causes the plungers to move up and down in Ihe upper and lower cylinders. On Ihe upstroke, the liquid in the compression chamber is compressed and at Ihe top of the stroke, Ihe loner plunger allows liquid to flow past lower plunger into lower cylinder. At that moment the compressed liquid contained in the compression chamber is released, thereby generating a shock wave which propagates downwardly until it strik the bottom of the well and propagates farther into the fomiation. On the dowristroke, the upper part of the lower plunger is reinserted into the lower cylinder hile the upper plunger remains inside the upper cylinder, thereby providing the seal needed to compress the liquid in the compression chamber during the upstroke,<br>
A primary object of the second embodiment of the present in\e;ition is to provide a method and apparatus for producing a shock waves in a borehole of the injection well which includes a pumping unit arranged at the weliliead, a tubing string extending downwardly into production casing of the injection well, packer installed on tubing string, perforated cylinder connected with the bottom of the tubing string below a packer, a sealing device installed at the bottom of the perforated cylinder, a hollow cylinder assembly connected with the bottom of a sealing device, amplifier installed at the bottom of the cylinder assembly and a plunger assembly arranged within the cylinder assembly and connected via the sealing device with the pumping unit by means of sucker rod string, having at least one sucker rod and a polish rod for vacuuming water contained   cylinder assembly and discharging the water containing in Ihe production casing into the vacuumed volume of the cylinder assembly on downstroke, thereby generating a shock waves. The cylinder assembly includes a vacuum chamber connected with a bottom of the sealing device, a hollow lower cylinder an-anged below the vacuum<br><br>
chamber and a preventive cylinder an-anged between the vacuum chamber and lower cylinder. In addition, the internal bore of a lower cylinder is adapted to receive the lower plunger. When the plunger is displaced downwardly in the cylinder assembly, the plunger travels out of the vacuum. Due to the plunger travels out of the cylinder assembly the volume of vacuum chamber is increased and the water contained therein becomes vacuumed. When the pumping unit reaches the bottom of its stroke, the top of the plunger exits from the bottom of the lower cylinder allowing the water contained in casing to be discharged into the vacuum chamber generating a first shock wave.<br>
When the plunger is displaced upwardly in the cylinder assembly, ihe plunger travels into the vacuum chamber and Ihe volume of vacuum chamber i= decreased and the water contained therein becomes compressed. When the pumping unit reaches the top of its stroke, the bottom of the plunger exits from the top of the lower cylinder allowing the compressed water contained in vacuum chamber to be discharged into the casing generating shock wave.

On upstroke, the plunger is reinserted into the lower barrel and water contained in the cylinder assembly is compressed while the sealing device provides the necessary sealing of the volume ofcylinder assembly. When the bottom of the lov/er plunger exits the top of the lower cylinder, the compressed water contained in vacuum chamber is released into the lower cylinder and, correspondingly, borehole, thereby generating a shock wave which propagates downwardly until it strikes the bottom of the well and perforations and propagates farther into formation. The \\"a[er ft-om the casing refills the cylinder assembly until the lower plunger will not be reinserted into the lower cylinder during the beginning of downstroke and the circle will not be repeated.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
Referring first to Figure I, there is shown a device 2 for producing a shock wave in a borehole or well 4. The device includes a pumping unit 6 arranged at the wellhead, a tubing string 8 extending downwardly into the perforated production casing 10 of the well, and a cylinder assembly 12 connected with the lower end Sa of the tubing string. A casing valve 14, a hibing valve 16, and a stutTir.g box 18 are also arranged at the wellhead.<br>
The cylinder assembly !2 Includes an upper cylinder 20 coniiiijied with the lower end of the ttibing string 8a, a compression cylinder 22 connected with the lower end of the upper cylinder 20, a crossover cylinder 24 connected with the bottom of the compression cylinder 22, and a lower cylinder 26 connected with the bottom of the crossover cylinder 24. The upper cylinder contains an internal bore 2!, Ihe compression cylinder contains a compression chamber 23, and ihe lower cylinder contains an internal bore 27, and an opening 28 in its lo^-."^r end.<br>
A plunger assembly 30 includes an upper plunger 32 adapted lo ht within the internal bore 21 of upper cylinder 20, and a lower plunger 34 adapted to fu within the internal bore 27 of lower cylinder 26. For reasons described below, the diameter of the upper plunger 32 is smaller than the diameter of the lower plunger 34. The upper plunger 32 is connected with the pumping unit 6 with a polish rod<br><br>
35 which extends through the stuffing box 18, and a plurality of sucker rods 36 which extend through the tubing string 8. One or more connection rods 3S connect the upper plunger 32 with the lower plunger 34.<br>
As shown in Figures 2 and 3, the lower plunger 34 includes an upper portion 34a having a smooth outer surface 40 which forms a generally water-tight seal with the internal bore 27 of the lower cylinder 26, and a lower portion 34b which contains a plurality of flow channels 42. A flow-tlu"ough bore 44 extends longitudinally through the plunger from a ball chamber 46 contained in the upper portion of the plunger to the lower end 34c of the plunger. A seating ring 4S is arranged between the ball chamber 46 and the flow-llorough bore 44.<br>
The ball chamber 46 includes ports 50 and contains a ball 52 adapted to mate with seating ring 48. When the lower plunger 34 is displaced upwardly during the compression stroke, the ball 52 engages the seating ring 48, thereby preventing the flow of liquid through the flow-through bore 44. When the lower plunger 34 is displaced downwardly, the ball 52 disengages the seating ring 48, thereby allowing liquid to flow upwardly through the flow-through bore 44 into the compression chamber 23.<br><br>
To generate a shock wave in the well using the device, the well 4 and cylinder assembly 12 are filled with a suitable liquid 54, such as water. The hydrostatic level of the liquid in the well must be higher than the top of the upper cylinder 20. During the upstroke of the pumping unit 6, the volume in the cylinder assembly between the bottom of the upper plunger 32 and the lower plunger 34 is reduced. Accordingly, the water contained therein is compressed. The volume reduction is due to the fact that the large diameter lower plunger 34 displaces more liquid than the small diameter upper plunger 32 as each moves in tandem upwardly in the cylinder assembly 12. The volume of the compression chamber is defmed by the foHowing;<br><br>

di and d^ are the diameters of the upper and lower plungers, lespectiveiy;<br>

}i is the viscosity of ihe compressed liquid;<br>
P is the pressure on the front of the shock wave; and<br>
b is the compressibility coefficient of the liquid.<br>
At the moment the upper portion 34a of the lower plunger 34 exits the lower cylinder 26, the compressed liquid is discharged into the lower cylinder 26 and into the production casing 10, thereby creating a shock wave which impacts the bottom of the well. Part of the shock wave energy is reflected back toward die wellhead while part is transmitted into the surrounding bed or formation 56 to stimulate oil production therein.<br>
The high efficiency of the present invention is due to the high power of the shock wave created. A high power wave can be created because the maximum pressure is not limitedby the working pressure of the stuffing box, Ihe "■iloating" of the polish rod, or other possible casing leaks. The present invention allows any reasonable maximum pressure on the front of the shock wave to be created as defined by the following equation:<br><br><br>
Since the present invention does not require that the borehole volume be sealed, the need for a cemem plug is eliminated. In addition, the present invention can be an^anged in the vicinity of the bottom of the well, thereby reducing energy losses of the shock wave traveling in the casing. However, it should be appreciated that a bridge plug may be set in the casing above the bottom of the uell, if it is deemed expedient to do so, to effect hydraulic isolation of a section of the well bore. It should be understood that if a bridge plug is installed in the well bore between the bottom of the well and the device for producing a shock wave, the location where the bridge plug is installed is deemed to be the bottom of the well.<br>
While in accordance with the provisions of the Paten! Statutes the preferred forms and embodiments of the invention have been illustrated and described, it will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art that various changes and modifications may be made without deviating from the invenfive concepts set forth above.<br>

OPERATION<br>
To generate shock waves in the injection well 121 using device the cylinder assembly 122 is installed inside the casing 113 of injection well at ihe end of the sealing device 105 connected with the bottom of Ihe perforated cylinder 114, which, in turn, is cormected with the tubing string 104 which is connected to injection line via valve. The packer 115 is used to separate the upper part of the well borehole from the lower one in order to prevent injection of w.Tier into the shallow layers of formation 130,<br>
During the downstroke of the pumping unit, the plunger asiembiy 129 moving downward creates the vacuum inside the vacuum chamber 126 due to the fact that the plunger 111 increases the volume of the cylinder assembly 122 while the sealing device 105 provides the sealing of the cylinder assembly" 122 at the upper end. At the moment the top of plunger 111 exits from the bottou; of lower cylinder 110, water in casing 121 is discharged into the lower cylinder 110 and vacuum chamber 126 due to the difference of pressure inside the vacuum chamber 126 and hydrastatic pressure incasing 121, thereby generating a shock wa\"e which travels downward and hits the bottom of the well and perforations 119. Part of the Shockwave energy is reflected back toward the amplifier (and again is reflected to the bottom-hole) while part is transmitted into the surrounding bed or formation 130 thereby stimulating oil recovery and oil production. The water from casing refills the volume of the cylinder assembly 122 until the plunger 111 is re-inserted into the lower cylinder U 0 at the beginning of an upstroke.<br>
During the upstroke of pumping unit 101, the volume of the cylinder assembly is reduced. Accordingly, the water contained therein is compressed. At the moment the bottom of the plunger 111 exits the top of the lower c&gt;iinder 110, the compressed water contained in Ihe cylinder assembly 122 is discliar^cd into the lower cylinder 110 and farther into casing 121, thereby generating a siiock wave which impacts the perforations 119 and the bottom of the injection ".veil Part of the shock wave energy is reflected back toward the amplifier (and again is reflected to the bottom-hole) while part is transmitted into the surrounding bed or formation<br><br>
130 to improve the permeability of the formation thereby stimulating oil production and recovery.<br>
There is the best application of the present invention for each combination of the following parameters; well depth, diameter and length of plunger and lower cylinder, diameter and length of the vacuum chamber, diameter and length of rod string, size of sealing device, length of stroke, number of strokes per minute, and properties of the injected water or other fluid. In particular, for a 3 meter length of stroke of the pumping unit, 6 strokes per minute, depth of the well bottom hole equaled 1070 m, volume of the vacuum chamber accounted for 0.2 m3diameter of plunger 0.06985 m, irmer diameter of sealing device equaled 0.05715m, pressure inside the vacuum chamber accounted for 21.0 MPa, coefficient of the water compressibility accounted for 2x10" MPa, speed of sound in water equaled iOOOm/s, coefficient of air/gas content in the water accounted for O.OOI, the dominant frequency of the formation accounted for 25Hz, the a adiabatic coefficient of air equaled 1.4 In this case the best parameters of application are determined by the following formulas.<br>
The optimum length o[ the tubing string is defined by the expression:<br>
Lt=Hb-Q.5c/f-Lca, where Hd is the depth of bottom of the well, c is a sound of speed of water containing in borehole, f is dominant frequency of formation, L,c h a length of a cylinder assembly.<br>
For L„= 50 m, c = 1000 m/s, f = 25 Hz and 11,,= 1070 m the length of the tubing string has to be 1000 m in order to create the vibrations of the shock waves reflected from bottom hole and amplifier on the frequency corresponding the dominant frequency of formation f. In this case the resonance phenomenon will be observed and the radius of affection by the seismic waves will be substantially higher.<br>
The high efficiency of the present invention is due to the high power of the shock wave created and the installation of the device in active injection well without a cemenD"bridge plug. A high power waves can be because the<br><br>
pressure inside the vacuum chamber is not limited by the working pressure of the stuffing box 117, the "floating" of the polish rod 120, possible casing leaks and the absence of gas flowing into the casing from formation. The amplitude of shock wave at the bottom of downstroke Ad  can be controlled by the parameters defined by the following formulae:<br><br>
where w is a water density, p, is a coefficient of air/gas content in the injected water, V, is a volume of the vacuum chamber 126, Dp is adiameter of plunger 111, Dr an inner diameter of sealing device 106, k is the a adiabatic coefficient, L,„ is the length of stroke, g is the constant of the acceleration of gravity, H„ is the depth of installation of the lower cylinder. The amplitude of the shock wa\e in this case accounts for 9.5 MPa for the following values of parameters: p,, = 1000 kgW, g = 9.S1 m/sec, H„ = 1000 m, p, = 0.001, V, = 0.2 m\ Dp = 0.069S5 m, Db = 0.05715 m, L5,r = 3.05m, k = 1.4 for air.<br>
The present invention also allows to create the maximum pressure on the front of the shock wave on upstroke defined by the following formulate:<br><br>
where 7r=3.I4, T= 60/n, a is quantity stroke per minute, b is the compressibility coefi~icient of the injection water, Vc  is the volume of the vacuum chamber 126, P is the pressure inside the vacuum chamber 26, D,, is a diameter of plunger 111, D,; is a an inner diameter of sealing device 105, Ld is the length of plunger 111, Ld^ is the length of sealing device 105, V^ is the speed the motion of the sucker rod siring 104, ^i is viscosity of the injection water, k is the coefficient of fluid displacement by plunger 111, 6 is a clearance inside the sealing device 105 and behveen the plunger 111 and lower cylinder 110.<br>
The amplitude of this shock wave accounts for 20.0 MPa for the following values of parameters: k ^ 0.55, b = 2x10" MPa, n = 6 str/min, V, = 0.2 m3  Dp =<br><br>
0.05715 m, Di, = 0.06985 m, V^ = 0,6 m/sec, ji_= ID"" Pa sec, P = 21 MPa,, 6 = 7.62xl0-"m, Lp = L|, = 0.91 m.<br>
Hence the amplitude of shock wave can be gradually controlled by, say, changing of the number of strokes per minute n and the speed the motion of the rod string V^ or, in other words, length of stroke Lj,r by means of using a hydraulic pump.<br>
In order to provide the vacuuming of the vacuum chamber 126 on downstroke the weight of rod string 104 and plunger assembly 129 must overcome the upwardly acting negative force created inside the vacuum chamber 126. Therefore the rods have to have some minimal radius. In other words, the diameter of sucker rods d^ has to be not less than;<br><br>
where p^ is a water density, p^ is a steel density, p^ is a coefficient of air/gas content in the injected water, V^ is a volume of the vacuum chamber !26, D^ is a diameter of plunger ! 19, Di, is an inner diameter of sealing device 105, k is the a adiabatic coefficient, Lj,^ is the length of stroke. For above noted parameters of the present invention, namely, for p„ = 1000 kgW, p^ = 7S00 kg/m3, p, = 0.001, V,= 0.2 m\ Dp = 0.06985 m, D,, = 0.05715 m, L,., = 3.05m, k = 1.4 (for air) the diameter of sucker rods d^ has to be notless than 0,0148 m in order to overcome the vacuum in vacuum chamber 126 created on downstroke.<br>
In order to provide the intermittent exiting of the plunger 111 from the bottom and the top of lower cylinder 110 at the bottom of downstroke and at the top of upstroke, correspondingly, the length of lower cylinder has to be less some value defined by the formulae:<br><br>
where L,^ is the length of the lower cylinder 110, L^.^ is the length of stroke, L, is a length of the rod assembly 106, Dp is the diameter of plunger, D^^ is the inner diameter of sealing device 105, E is modulus ofelasticity of the rod"s material, P^^<br><br>
is the pressure inside the vacuum chamber 126 on upstroke, Pj is the pressure insidethevacuumchamber 126 on ciownstroke,g is the constant of the acceleration of gravity, p^ is a water densiEy, p, is a stee) density, Lp is a length of the plunger. Hence for the parameters: L,„ = 3.05m, E = 2 x 10" MPa, L„= 0.9 m, d,= 0.0254 m, P„=21 MPa, ,P^= 0.17 MPa, Dp = 0.06935 m,Di, = 0.05715 m, I.,= 1070 m, p„ = 1000 kg/m\ g = 9.81 m/sec, p, = 7800 kg/m^ the length of the lower cylinder has to be not more than 0.5 m.<br>
In addition, the present invention has high efficiency due to the installation of the amplifier 112 connected with the bottom of lower cylinder 110. .\mplifier 112 decreases the energy losses of a shock wave up to 40-50% and increase its amplitude. Considering that the inner diameter of amplifier 112 (or diiYuser 128) changes in accordance with expression W^(x) = Dpex"p(xcc/2) (wherein x is a current length of amplifier, a is a coefficient), an optimum total lengih of amplifier J is defined by the formulae:<br><br>
velocity of sound in the water or other fluid in the well. Coefficient k equals 0.0343 m"" if the amplifier 112 is installed 20 m above of bo!lom hole and c = 1000 m/sec. Assuming that internal and external diameters of amplifier equals 0.06985m and 0.n56m, correspondingly, and a = 13.6 m\ the parameser m equals 13.59 m"". So the optimum length of amplifier 112 accounts for 0.074 m. The coefficient of amplification A of amplifier 112 is described by ihe followmg<br><br>
where Sh(ml/2) and Ch(ml/2) are hyperbolic sine and cosine, correspondingly. Coefficient of amplification A equals 1.41 for above defined parameters.<br><br>
In addition, the present invention has high etticiency due lo me inbLnudLiuii of the amplifier U 2 on some distance from the bottom of the wel] thereby creating a sequence of reflections waves on the frequency coinciding with the dominant frequency of the formation and that allows substantially increase the area affected by the waves traveling through the formation. The installation distance of amplifier 112 is defined by the formulae:<br><br>
where c is the speed of sound in water in the borehole, f is the dominant frequency of the formation. The installation distance S equals, for example, 20 m for the following parameters: c = 1000 m/sec, f = 25H2 (see an article ""residual Oil Reservoir Recovery with Seismic Vibrations" written by V. N. Nikolaeviky et al., published in SPE Production &amp;. Facilities, May 1996).<br>
In addition, the present invention has high reliability provided by means of installing of the preventive cylinder 109 allowing to eliminate tl-,e cavitation erosion of the top/bottom of the lower cylinder 110 and the bottom top of the plunger 111 occurring due to the high velocity of water during the process of the water discharging from the borehole into the vacuum chamber 126 into the lower cylinder 110 at the bottom of dowrjslroke and discharging of \v21er from the vacuum chamber 126 into borehole at the top of the upstroke.<br>
The inner diameter IDpc of the preventive cylinder 109 has to be not less<br><br>
where D is the diameter of the plunger ill, ID^ is an inner diameter of"vacuum chamber 126, p„ is the density of the water, g is the constant of the acceleration of gravity, H is the installation depth of preventive cylinder 10 9, Pj is the saturation vapor pressure, ^ is the coefficient ot the flow resistance, P is pressure inside vacuum chamber 126. In real numbers (the best application for tlie above noted<br><br>
parameters of present invention) the diameter of preventive cylinder 109 has to be not less than 0.079 m for the following values of parameici-.s: Dp = 0.069S5 m,  = 0.0742 m, P = 21MPa, p„ = 1000 kg/m\ g = 9.81 m/sec, U = 1000 m, P, = 0.17 MPa, ^ = 9.0;<br>
installing of the stabilizing rod I IS on the top of the plunger  11 preventing the possibility of the stability loss ( i.e. bending) of rod 1 IS due to the high force affecting on the rod 11S immediately after the appearance of the shock wave. The length Lj^ of stabilizing rod 18 is defined by the formulae:<br><br>
Referring to Figure 8 of the drawing, the niimer:!) 200 refers to a source well having a device 2 or 102 mounted therein for producing seismic shock waves. Source well 200 is preferably an injection well used for water flood or tor the delivery of a variety of well stimulation materials, such as steam, acid, surfactants or fracking materials-Numerals 205 and 210 generally refer to observation wells, each of which is equipped with an array of geophones 215 which may be vertically stacked or multi-component geophones. The geophones are of conventional design and are connected to suitable equipment for recording multi-channel seismic, signals and data.<br>
Seismic data collected from observation wells 205 and 210 car. be analyzed to determine the effectiveness of seismic waves delivered by devices 2 and I0_ mto the formation. Based on the recorded seismic data, the parameters oi device3 2 and<br><br>
102 may be adjusted to operate at the dominant frequency or natural frequency of the formation. For example, the fi-equency of pump jack 101 and the distance of amplifier 112 from the bottom of the well might be adjusted for tuning the device 201 to generate shock waves at the dominant frequency of the formation to provide optimum stimulation for increasing the permeability of the formation. Adjustment of the device 201 vertically in the well allows it to be positioned to produce shock waves at the dominant frequency to optimize pressure distribution into the formation. Shock waves traveling radially from the source well are reflected and refracted as they move through the fomiation to the geophones 215 at the observation wells. The waves can be observed and adjusted to optimize the effectiveness of device 201 to increase fluid flow toward the production wells in the field.<br>
As illustrated in Figure 9, a graph of amplitude versus frequency shows that the amplitude increases as the frequency increases until it reaches a maximum at which time the amplitude decreases with a further increase in frequency. Data collected at the observation wells 205 and 210 can be used to detennine the most effective frequency for stimulation of the formation. The formation filters out frequencies other than the dominant frequency.<br>
The present invention has high efficiency due to the instailntion of the<br>
amplifier 112 on some distance S" from the bottom of the well or distance S from<br>
the bridge plug 132 (a bridge plug is installed if the bottom of the well exceeds the<br>
required distance from the amplifier 112) but below the perforations 119 thereby<br>
creating a sequence of reflected waves bet-.veen the bottom of the ■.\ell or bridge<br>
plug and ampli fier 112 on the frequency coinciding with the dominant frequency of<br>
the formation and that allows a substantial increase in the area of affection by the<br>
waves created by the invention that travel through the formation. Tlie distance the<br>
amplifier 112 is to be installed above the bottom 131 of the well or bridge plug 132<br>
is defined by the following formulae:<br>
c S= —,<br>
2f<br><br>
where c is the sound of speed of fluid containing in the borehold, f is dominant frequency of formation. The installation distance S equals, for example, 33 feel for the following parameters: c = 1000 m/sec, f = 25Hz (see an article "residual Oil Reservoir Recovery with Seismic Vibrations " written by V. N. NikoLievsky et ni, published in SPE Production &amp; Facilities. May 1996 - see the frequency spectra at the different distances from an explosion). The dominant frequency is determined by installation ofgeophone(s)215 on the same prodactive layer in one of the offset wells 205 and 210 and generating at least one shock wave. A frequency spectrum is measured by geophone 215, the frequency having the highest amplitude will be the dominant frequency of the formation, as shown in Figure 9, After that the distance of installation S (as well as depth of installation) is determined by the above noted formulae, the dominant frequency for each sublayer also can be determined by means of installation of geophones on the depth corresponding to the particular sublayer and carrying out the measurement. Also, the dominant frequency can be determined for the different areas of the reserv-oir using this procedure.<br>
Geophones 215 and equipment required for collecting and recording seismic data are commercially available from GEOVision Geophysical Services, a Division of Blackhawk Geometries of Corona, California. This equipment is known  to persons skilled in the art and further description is not deemed necessary.<br>
For 4-D seismic graphing this set up is particularly efficient because the source is precisely controllable and has the constant frequency spectrum and the seismic waves are reproduceable over extended periods of time. Thus, data which is incompatible does not have to be mathmatically manipulated and analyed for producing the maps to determine the location of pockets or the effectiveness of seismic or other stimulation of the formation.<br>
Terms such as "horizontal," "vertical," "up," and ""down" when  used in reference to the drawings, generally refer to the orientation of the pans in the illustrated embodiment and not necessarily in the described orientation during use.<br><br>
The device may be used in vertical, deviated or horizontal wells and may be used to stimulate flow of water, steam and other fluids used for treatment of the formation and for increasing recovery of water and other fluids in addition to gas, oil and other petroleum products.<br>
Although the present invention has been described in terms of the presently preferred embodiments, it is to be understood that the disclosure is not to be interpreted as limiting. Various alterations and modifications will no doubt become apparent to those skilled in the art after having read the above disclosure. Accordingly, it is intended that the appended claims be interpreted as covering all alterations and modifications as fall within the true spirit and scope of the invention.<br><br><br>
