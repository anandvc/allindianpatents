				<td>CONDENSED PURINE DERIVATIVES AS A, ADENOSINE RECEPTOR ANTAGONISTS<br>
This application claims benefit of United States Provisional Application No. 60/250,658, filed December 1, 2000, which is herein incorporated by reference.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to medicinal chemistry and pharmacology. More particularly, it relates to antagonists of the adenosine receptors, pharmaceutical compositions comprising these compounds and methods of making and using the same in the treatment of diseases.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Adenosine is a ubiquitous biochemical messenger. Adenosine binds to and activates seven-transmembrane spanning G-protein coupled receptors, eliciting a variety of physiological responses. Adenosine receptors are divided into four known subtypes (i.e., AI, Aza, A2b, and AS). These receptor subtypes mediate different, and sometimes opposing, effects. Activation of the adenosine AI receptor, for example, elicits an increase in renal vascular resistance, while activation of the adenosine A^ receptor elicits a decrease in renal vascular resistance.<br>
In most mammalian organ systems, periods of metabolic stress result in significant increases in the concentration of adenosine in the tissue. The heart, for instance, produces and releases adenosine to mediate adaptive responses to stress, such as reductions in heart rate and coronary vasodilatation. Likewise, adenosine concentrations in kidneys increase in response to hypoxia, metabolic stress and many nephrotoxic substances. The kidneys also produce adenosine constitutively, The kidneys adjust the amount of constitutively produced adenosine in order to regulate glomerular filtration and electrolyte reabsorption. Regarding control of glomerular filtration, activation of A] receptors leads to constriction of afferent arterioles, while activation of A2a receptors leads to dilatation of efferent artenoles. Activation of Aia receptors exerts vasodilatory effects on the afferent arteriole. Overall, the effect of activation of these glomerular adenosine receptors is to reduce giomeruiar nitration rate. In addition, AI adenosine receptors are located in the proximal tubule and distaj tubular sites. Activation of these receptors stimulates sodium<br><br>
reabsorption from the tubular lumen. Accordingly, blocking the effects of adenosine on these receptors produces a rise in glomerular filtration rate and an increase in sodium excretion.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention is based on the discovery that compounds of Formula I and II are potent and selective inhibitors of particular subtypes of adenosme receptors. Based on this discovery, the invention features adenosine antagonists useiul in the prevention and/or treatment of numerous diseases, including cardiac and circulatory disorders, degenerative disorders of the central nervous system, respiratory disorders, and many diseases for which diuretic treatment is suitable, hi general, the invention features highly potent and selective antagonists of the adenosine A] receptor.

Uses for the Adenosine Antagonist Compounds<br>
Activation of subtype Al adenosine receptors elicits many physiological responses, including reductions in renal blood flow, reductions in glomerular filtration rate, and increases in sodium reabsorption in kidney. Activation of Al adenosine receptors also reduces heart rate, reduces conduction velocity, and reduces contractility. These, and the other effects of activation of Al adenosine receptors in other organs, are normal regulator}' processes. However, these effects become pathological in many disease states. Thus, Al adenosine receptor antagonists have extensive application in both prevention and treatment of disease. Diseases that can be prevented and/or treated with Al adenosine receptor antagonists include diseases and disorders wherein activation of Al adenosine receptors plays a role in pathophysiology. Examples of such diseases and disorders include, but are not limited, to. congestive heart failure,; respiratory<br>
disorders (e.g., bronchial asthma, allergic lung diseases^andimany diseases, for which - .diuretic treatment is indicated (e,g., acute and chronic renal failure,-renal insufficiency, hypertension).<br>
Additionally, the invention provides for the administration of highly selective and potent adenosine A; receptor antagonists, for example, to elicit a diuretic response when administered alone and to potentiate the diuretic response to traditional diuretics, hi addition, administration of Al adenosine receptor antagonists with traditional diuretics attenuates the reduction of glomerular filtration rate induced by traditional diuretics. This is useful, for example, in treating edematous conditions, such as congestive heart failure and ascites.<br>

Membrane preparation<br>
Rat A; Receptor: Membranes were prepared from rat cerebral cortex isolated from freshly euthanized rats. Tissues were homogenized in buffer A (10 mM EDTA, 10 mM Na-HEPES, pH 7.4) supplemented with protease inhibitors (10 jig/ml benzamidine, 100 uM PMSF, and 2 p-g/ml each of aprotinin, pepstatin and leupeptin), and centrifuged at 20,000 x g for 20 min. Pellets were resuspended and washed twice with buffer HE (10 mM Na-HEPES, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.4, plus protease inhibitors). Final pellets were resuspended in buffer HE, supplemented with 10% (w/v) sucrose and protease inhibitors, and frozen in aliquots at -80°C. Protein concentrations were measured using BCA protein assay kit (Pierce).<br>
Human AI Receptor: Human Al adenosine receptor cDNA was obtained by RT-PCR and subcloned into pcDNA3.1(Invitrogen). Stable transfection of CHO-Ki cells was performed using LIPOFECTAMINE-PLUS (GTBCO-BRL) and colonies were selected in 1 nag/ml G418, and screened using radioligand binding assays. For membrane preparations, CHO-KI cells growing as monolayers in complete media (F12+10%FCS+lrng/mI G41S) were washed in PBS and harvested in buffer A supplemented with protease inhibitors. Cells were homogenized, centrifuged, and washed rwice with buffer HE as described above. Final pellets were stored in aliquots at -80QC. Radiolisand binding assavs<br><br>
Membranes (50y.gmembrane protein, for.rat. AlARs,,and 25/igof CHO-K1 membrane protein for human, AlARs),:radioligands and varying concentrations' of competing ligands were incubated in triplicates in 0.1 ml buffer HE plus 2 units/ml adenosine deannnase for 2.5 h at 21 °C.   Radioligand [3H]DPCPX (112 Ci/mmol from NEN, final concentration: InM) was used for competition binding assays on AiARs. Nonspecific binding was measured in the presence of 10 uM BG9719. Binding assays were terminated by filtration over Whatman GF/C glass fiber filters using a BRANDEL cell harvester. Filters were rinsed three times with 3-4 ml ice-cold 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 and 5 mM MgCl2 at 4°C. Filter paper was transferred to a vial, and 3ml of scintillation cocktail ScintiVersell (Fisher)was added.   Radioactivity was counted in a Wallac $-counter. Analysis of binding_data<br>
For KI Determinations: Competition binding data were fit to a single-site binding model and plotted using Prizm GraphPad. Cheng-Prusoff equation KI = IC5o/(l+[I]/KD) was used to calculate KI values from ICso values, where KI is the affinity constant for the competing ligand, [I] is the concentration of the free radioligand, and KD is the affinity constant for the radioligand.<br>
For % Binding: For one-point binding assays, data were presented as % of total specific binding at luM of competing compound: % of total =100* (Specific binding with 1 uM of compering compound/ total specific binding). % binding represents the amount of bound radioligand remaining in the presence of 1 uM of competing antagonist.<br>
Results<br>
All of the compounds tested exhibited rat AI K, values between about 4 and about 800 nM. hi Table 2, the rat Al adenosine receptor Ki value and % binding for the compounds are presented.<br>

Ceil Culture<br>
CHO cells stably expressing the recombinant human-A-AdoR (CHOiAiAdoR cells) were prepared as described (Kollias-Barkeret al, J, Pharma. Exp. Ther. 281(2), 761, 1997) and cultured as for CHO:Wild cells. CHO cells were cultured as monolayers on plastic dishes in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 U penicillin G and 100 jig streptomycin in a humidified atmosphere of 5% C02/95% air at 37°C. The density of [3H]CPX binding sites in CHO cells was 26 ±2 (n=4) fmol/mg protein. Cells were subcultured twice weekly after detachment using 1 mM EDTA in Ca^-Mg^-free HEPES-buffered Hank's solution. Three different clones of CHO:AiAdoR cells were used for experiments, and all results were confirmed with cells from two or three clones. The density of AiAdoRs in these cells was 4000-8000 fmoiymg protein, as determined by assay of [ HJCPX specific binding. Radioligand Binding<br>
CHO cells grown on 150 mm culture dishes were rinsed with HEPES-buffered Hank's solution, then removed with a cell scraper and homogenized in ice-cold 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. Cell membranes were pelleted by centrifugation of the cell homogenate at 48,000 X g for 15 minutes. The membrane pellet was washed twice by resuspension in fresh buffer and centrifugation. The final pellet was resuspended in a small volume of 50 mM Tns-HCl, pH 7.4, and stored in'aliquots of 1 ml at -80°C until used for assays.<br>
To determine the density of AiAdoRs in CHO cell membranes, 100 ui aliquots of membranes (5 u-g protein) were incubated for 2 hours at 25°C with 0.15-20 nM [3H]CPX and adenosine deaminase (2 U/ml) in 100 ul of 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. Incubations were terminated by dilution with 4 ml of ice-cold 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer and immediate collection of membranes onto glass-fiber filters (Schleicher and Schuell, Keene, NH) by vacuum filtration (Brandel, Gaithersburg, MD). Filters were washed quickly three times with ice-cold buffer to remove unbound radioligand. Filter discs containing trapped membranes bound radioligand were placed in 4 ml of Scintiverse BD (Fisher), and the radioactivity was quantified using a liquid scintillation counter. To determine nonspecific binding of [3H]CPX, membranes were incubated as described above and 10 uM CPT was added to the incubation buffer. Nonspecific binding was defined as [JH]CPX bound in the presence of 10 uM CPT. Specific binding of the radioligand to the AiAdoR was determined by subtracting nonspecific binding from total binding. Nonspecific binding<br><br>
was found to increase linearly with an increase of [3H]CPX concentration. Triplicate<br>
assays were, done at each-tested concentration of [3H].CPX.     -	<br>
To determine the affinities of antagonists of AjAdoRs for the human recombinant AI AdoR expressed in CHO cells, binding of 2 nM [3H]CPX in the presence of increasing concentrations of antagonist was measured. Aliquots of CHO cell membranes (100 ul: 5 \ig protein), [JH]CPX, antagonist (0.1 nM- 100 uM), and adenosine deaminase (2 U/ml) were incubated for 3 hours at 25° C in 200 ^1 of 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4). Assays were terminated as described above.<br>
