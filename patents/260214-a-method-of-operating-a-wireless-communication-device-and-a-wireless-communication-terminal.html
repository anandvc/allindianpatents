				<td>More efficient utilization of available bandwidth is implemented in an OFDM wireless communication system. The partitions of bandwidth may be of different sizes and may be different from the original system design parameters. Basic system structure such as the number of tones used and the number of OFDM symbol times in a slot is maintained throughout the system.

WIRELESS TERMINAL METHODS AND APPARATUS FOR USE IN WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS SUPPORTING DIFFERENT SIZE FREQUENCY BANDS<br>
RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
The present application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application S.N. 60/618,616, filed on October 14, 2004, titled "METHODS AND APPARATUS FOR ADJUSTING BANDWIDTH ALLOCATION IN A WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM", which is hereby expressly incorporated by reference.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to communications systems, and more particularly, to methods and apparatus for adjusting bandwidth allocation in a wireless communications system.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
In some wireless communications systems, the total available bandwidth in a given cell or sector may be partitioned into different frequency bands, e.g., distinct frequency bands. In addition, the total available bandwidth in a given cell or sector may vary throughout the system.<br>
Typically, the known available bandwidth in a given cell or sector is partitioned to include a number of frequency bands, each band in the system having the same bandwidth, basic structure, and timing so that the wireless terminals can readily establish connections, perform communications, and execute hand-off operations with the various base stations throughout the system. When, the available bandwidth (BW) in a given cell or sector is partitioned, in addition to the fixed size frequency bands, there may be left over unused frequency bandwidth that is currently wasted.<br>
Figure 1 includes a drawing 100 illustrating exemplary partitioning of BW in an exemplary code division multiple access (CDMA) system and a drawing 150 illustrating exemplary partitioning of BW in an exemplary orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system. In drawing 100, the available BW, e.g., 5MHz, 102 is partitioned to include three 1.25 MHz BW bands (104, 106, 108), each associated with a carrier frequency (fA 110, fB<br><br>
112, fc 114), respectively. CDMA signaling (116, 118, 120) is associated with (fA 110, fB 112, fc 114), respectively.  Regions 122 and 124 represent signaling overlap from adjacent bands. Regions 126, 128 represent regions of boundary areas, which have been established within the allocated 5MHz band 102 to limit interference to outside adjacent bands. In CDMA systems, due to the characteristics of the CDMA signals and the power shaping filters used for each band (104, 106, 108) the 1.25 MHz bandwidth associated with the composite of the regions 126, 122, 124, and 128 is used and generally needed to: (i) limit interference levels between adjacent bands (104, 106, 108) thus allowing for reliable operation in the system and (ii) prevent the signaling from (116, 120) from encroaching on adjacent bands outside of the allocated 5 MHz band 102, which may be allocated to a system operated by a different service provider.<br>
In drawing 150, the available BW, e.g., 5MHz, 152 is partitioned to include, e.g., three 1.27 MHz BW bands (154, 156, 158). OFDM signaling within band 154 includes signals communicated on OFDM modulation symbols using, e.g., 113 evenly spaced tones (tone 1 160, tone 2 162, tone 3 164,... tone 113 166). The inter-tone spacing (184, 186) is the same between each tone, e.g., 11.25KHz. The inter-tone spacing of 11.25kHz also represents the bandwidth allocated to a single tone. Similarly, OFDM signaling within band 156 includes signals communicated on OFDM modulation symbols using, e.g., 113 evenly spaced tones (tone 1 168, tone 2 170, tone 3 172,... tone 113 174). The inter-tone spacing (188, 190) is the same between each tone, e.g., 11.25KHz. Similarly, the OFDM signaling within band 158 includes signals communicated on OFDM modulation symbols using, e.g., 113 evenly spaced tones (tone 1 176, tone2 178,tone3 180, ...tone 113 182). The inter-tone spacing (192, 194) is the same between each tone, e.g., 11.25KHz. With OFDM signaling, unlike CDMA signaling, quite sharp power shaping filters can be used due to the nature of the OFDM signals. Drawing 150 shows three exemplary power shaping filters (151, 153, 155), each associated with a bandwidth only slightly larger than 1.27MHZ (157, 159, 161), respectively. This leaves a remaining unused bandwidth of slightly less than 1.19 MHz, as represented by the composite of regions 163, 165, 167,and 169. This amount is less than the standard size of 1.27MHz needed for an additional standard band, yet sizeable.<br>
In the exemplary OFDM system, the remainder unused bandwidth may be a result of the exemplary 5 MHZ system being different than what the system was originally designed. For example, the exemplary OFDM system may have been originally designed for distinct bandwidth allocations of approximately 1,27MHz.<br><br>
In view of the above, there is a need for methods and apparatus, particularly in OFDM systems, that increase or maximize the use of available allocated bandwidth. Methods and apparatus that flexibly allow for adaptations to changes in available bandwidth would be beneficial. Changes could be in response, e.g., to additional bandwidth licensed to a service provider or to dynamic redeployments of bandwidth to meet current user needs. In addition, designs that allow wireless terminals (WTs) to readily adjust to use different amounts of bandwidth in different sectors and/or cells of the same system would be advantageous. In such multiple bandwidth OFDM systems, there is also a need for efficient methods and apparatus to communicate from a base station to the WTs the bandwidth and/or structure associated with the cell and/or sector.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
Figure 2 is a drawing 202 illustrating exemplary OFDM tones in an exemplary 5 MHz BW 204 system. Three hundred and thirty-nine tones (tone 1 208, tone 2 210, tone 3 212, ... tone 339 214) are evenly spaced as shown by exemplary 11.25KHz spacing (216, 218). The 339 tones, representing three sets of 113 tones/set, occupy a total bandwidth of 3* 1.27MHz or approximately a 3.8 MHz band 206. Power shaping filter 220, slightly larger than the 3.8 MHz band, occupies frequency band 222. This leaves a remainder portion, comprising the combination of regions 224 and 226, of slightly less than 1.2 MHz which is unused and can be partially utilized in accordance with the methods of the present invention.<br>
Figure 3 is a drawing 302 illustrating exemplary OFDM tones in an exemplary 5 MHz BW 304 system. Three hundred and thirty-nine tones (tone 1 308, tone 2 310, tone 3 312,... tone 339 314) are evenly spaced as shown by exemplary 12.25KHz spacing (316, 318). The inter-tone spacing has been increased from 11.25 KHZ (Figure 3) to 12.25KHz (Figure 3), in accordance with the methods of the present invention, to more fully utilize the available bandwidth. The 339 tones, representing three sets of 113 tones/set, occupy a total bandwidth of 3*1.384 MHz or approximately a 4.15 MHz band 306. Power shaping filter 320, slightly larger than the 4.15 MHz occupies frequency band 322. This leaves a remainder portion, comprising the combination of regions 324 and 326, of slightly less than 0.85 MHz which is unused.<br>
Figure 4 includes diagrams 400, 420, 440, and 460 used to illustrate features of the present invention describing tone frequency interspacing variation linked to corresponding OFDM symbol transmission time interval variation, in accordance with the methods of the present invention. Figure 4 shows a frequency axis 401 which applies to both diagrams 400 and 440 and a time axis 403 which applies to both diagrams 420 and 460.<br>
Diagram 400 shows two exemplary tones, tone 1A 402 and tone 2A 404, with an inter-tone spacing of 11.25 KHz 406. The 11.25 KHz inter-tone spacing 406 may also be viewed as the bandwidth associated with a single tone 402,404. Corresponding to frequency diagram 400 is time diagram 420, which shows OFDM symbol transmission time interval for A tones, Tsym A<br><br>
422   A modulation symbol is transmitted on a single tone, e.g., tone i A 402, during OFDM symbol transmission time, Tsyni A 422.<br>
Diagram 440 shows two exemplary tones, tone IB 442 and tone 2B 444, with an inter-tone spacing of 12.25 KHz 446. The 12.25 KHz inter-tone spacing 446 may also be viewed as the bandwidth associated with a single tone 442, 444. Corresponding to frequency diagram 440 is time diagram 460, which shows OFDM symbol transmission time interval for B tones, Tsym B 462   A modulation symbol is transmitted on a single tone, e.g., tone IB 442, during OFDM symbol transmission time, Tsym B 462.<br>
It may be observed in Figure 4 that there is an inverse relationship between the tone interspacing and the OFDM symbol transmission time interval. As the tone inter-spacing increases to occupy more bandwidth, the OFDM symbol transmission tone decreases proportionally, in accordance with the present invention. For a given modulation symbol communicated, the same amount of air link resource, represented as bandwidth over time is consumed, in either case. In addition, the system can use the same basic structure, e.g., same number of total tones, same tone indexing schemes, same hopping sequences, same number of tones per slot, same number of tones per superslot, etc. in either of the two variations. However, in the variation represented by diagrams 440 and 460, the available overall bandwidth is being more fully utilized, and more modulation symbols are communicated for a given time duration. This can result in a data rate increase proportional to the frequency spacing increase.<br>
Figure 5 includes frequency vs time drawings 502, 552 to further illustrate the features of the present invention. Diagram 502 is a drawing of frequency on the vertical axis 504 vs time on the horizontal axis 506. Alternate representations are shown in parenthesis as (tone A index) on vertical axis 504 and (OFDM symbol index for A tones) on horizontal axis 506. The available bandwidth 503 is larger than the bandwidth occupied by the four tones used (index = 0, 1, 2, 3). Each tone occupies a frequency bandwidth, delta fA 508. An OFDM symbol transmission time interval, TSYMA 510 is the time to transmit one modulation symbol using a single tone. Each basic element of the air link resource, used for conveying a modulation symbol, is a tone-symbol 512 and is represented by a square box. Seven successive OFDM symbol times represent a half slot 514.<br><br>
Diagram 552 is a drawing of frequency on the vertical axis 554 vs time on the horizontal axis 556. The frequency vs time scaling shown in drawing 552 is the same as shown in drawing 502. Alternate representations are shown in parenthesis as (tone B index) on vertical axis 554 and (OFDM symbol index for B tones) on horizontal axis 556. The available bandwidth 503 in drawing 552 is the same as the available bandwidth 503 in drawing 502. In drawing 552, bandwidth 503 is fully occupied by the four tones used (index - 0, 1,2, 3). Each tone occupies a frequency bandwidth, delta fB 558, larger than delta fA 508. An OFDM symbol transmission time interval, TSYMB 560 is the time to transmit one modulation symbol using a single type B tone, and is smaller than TSYMA 510. Each basic element of the air link resource, used for conveying a modulation symbol, is a tone-symbol 562 and is represented by a rectangular box. Seven successive OFDM symbol times represent a half slot 564. It may be observed that the half slot 564 is shorter in duration than the half slot 514. Fixed time interval 505 is equivalent to the time represented by 12 OFDM symbol times of diagram 502 or the time represented by 16 symbol times in diagram 552. Each type of tone-symbol 512, 562 can convey the same or nearly the same amount of information. During a fixed time 505, on average, 48 tone-symbols, alternately referred to as transmission units, are available to convey modulation symbols with respect to drawing 502; however, on average, 64 tone-symbols are available with respect to drawing 552.<br>
Diagram 600 is used to illustrate an exemplary method of conveying bandwidth information from an exemplary base station to an exemplary WT in accordance with the methods of the present invention. The BS, sector or cell transmitters sends out downlink broadcast signaling, e.g. beacon signals, pilot signals, other broadcast signals such as assignment signals, and the WT can monitor, receive, and figure out the characteristics of the frequency band based on the information conveyed.<br>
In the example of Figure 6, drawing 600 shows an exemplary BW A 604 including 19 tones (index 0 .. 18), Vertical axis 602 represents frequency; vertical axis 602 also represents using parenthesis (downlink tone index for A type tones). Beacon signals, e.g., high power signals with the base station sector transmit power concentrated on one or a few tones are shown as beacon 1A 606 at tone index 0 and beacon 2A 608 at tone index 10. In this example, the beacon signals 606, 608 have been spaced a fixed number of tones apart 610, e.g., 10 tones apart, in accordance with the invention.<br><br>
Similarly drawing 600 also shows an exemplary BW B 654 including 19 tones (index 0 . 18). Vertical axis 652 represents frequency; vertical axis 652 also represents using parenthesis (downlink tone index for B type tones). Beacon signals are shown as beacon IB 656 at tone index 0 and beacon 2B 658 at tone index 10. In this example, the beacon signals have been spaced a fixed number of tones apart 660, e.g., 10 tones apart, in accordance with the invention.<br>
In an exemplary system, in a first region of the system, e.g., a first sector/cell combination, the base station can be implemented for the structure of BW A with type A tones, while in a second region, e.g., a second sector/cell combination, the base station can implemented for the structure of BW B with type B tones. In both regions the same total numbei of tones are employed and the same basic structures are used based on indexing numbers.<br>
It should be noted that the frequency difference represented by 610 is smaller than the frequency difference represented by 660; however, the tone index count difference is the same. Wireless terminals can monitor for the beacons, receive the pair of beacon signals, and knowing the fixed tone-indexing difference between the two beacon signals, calculate the appropriate inter-tone, spacing for the transmitter of the beacon signal pair. Having the system structured to use the same number of tones, irrespective of the bandwidth variation, allows the WTs, knowing the number of tones used in the system, to determine the bandwidth from the beacon signal spacing. Then, in accordance with the invention, the WT adjusts its clock to correspond to the appropriate inter-tone spacing. This adjustment of its clock also changes the OFDM symbol timing used proportionally. This method, in accordance with the invention, allows a WT to identify and readily adapt to various BWs, yet still maintain basic system structure, e.g., same number tones, same number of OFDM symbol times/slot, same number of OFDM symbol times/superslot. This approach, in accordance with the present invention, facilitates a flexible, low cost implementation approach to more fully utilizing available bandwidth in an OFDM environment.<br>
Figure 10 is a drawing 1000 illustrating an exemplary 5 MHz BW 1002 that has been partitioned to include three bands: a 1.27 MHz BW band 1004, a 1.38 MHz BW band 1006, and a 1.48 MHz BW band 1008, in accordance with the present invention. Each band includes 113 OFDM tones that may be used for OFDM signaling; the inter-tone spacing is different for each band. The 1.27 MHZ band 1004 includes tones (tone 1 1010, tone 2 1012, tone 3 1014,... tone 113 1016) with inter-tone spacing (1034, 1036) of 11.25KHz. Band 1004 uses power shaping<br><br>
filter 1001 occupying a BW 1007 slightly larger than 1.27 MHz. The 1.38 MHZ band 1006 includes tones (tone 1 1018: tone 2 1020, tone 3 1022, ... tone 113 1024) with inter-tone spacing (1038, 1040) of 12.25KHz. Band 1006 uses power shaping filter 1003 occupying a BW 1009 slightly larger than 1.38 MHz. The 1.48 MHZ band 1008 includes tones (tone 1 1026, tone 2 1028,tone3 1030,... tone 113 1032) with intervene spacing (1042, 1044) of 13.25KHz. Band 1008 uses power shaping filter 1005 occupying a BW 1011 slightly larger than 1.48 MHz.<br>
In Figure 10, bands (1004, 1006, 1008) may correspond to (sector A, sector B, sector C), respectively, in a given cell. The different BWs may have been chosen and matched to correspond to meet different loading conditions within the given sectors. Wireless terminals, moving between the different sectors, may use the methods of the present invention, to determine the characteristics of the band within the sector and adjust, e.g., adjust its clock, for proper operation and synchronization with the sector.<br>
Figure 7 shows an exemplary wireless communications system 700, supporting adjustable bandwidth allocation, implemented in accordance with the present invention. The system 700 uses apparatus and methods of the present invention. Figure 7 includes a plurality of exemplary multi-sector cells, cell 1 702, cell 2 704, cell 3 706. Each cell (702, 704, 706) represents a wireless coverage area for a base station (BS), (BS1 708, BS2 710, BS 3 712), respectively. In the exemplary embodiment, each cell 702, 704, 706 includes three sectors (A,B,C). Cell 1 702 includes sector A 714, sector B 716, and sector C 718. Cell 2 704 includes sector A 720, sector B 722, and sector C 724. Cell 3 706 includes sector A 726, sector B 728, and sector C 730. In other embodiments, different numbers of sectors per cell are possible, e.g., 1 sector per cell, 2 sectors per cell, or more than 3 sectors per cell. In addition, different cells may include different numbers of sectors.<br>

Received beacon information 932 includes information that has been extracted from the received and processed beacon signals, e.g., the identify of the BS and sector transmitter which generated the beacon signal, received power levels of beacon signals, and a measured beacon tone spacing 934. For example, for a given base station sector, the sector transmitter transmits a beacon signal(s) such that two tones in a set of n tones are used and are spaced apart by a known number of tones, e.g., a first beacon signal using a tone with index number x, and a second tone with index number (x + 10).

Based on the calculated clock adjustment information 936, the WT 900 controls adjustable clock module 909 to match the sector base station's tone inter-spacing and OFDM symbol timing. The output from the adjustable clock module 909, in the exemplary embodiment, goes to user I/O devices 908, processor 906, receiver 902, and transmitter 904. The processor 906 in conjunction with the receiver 902 and transmitter 904 controls operations in WT 900 such that the nominal timing and frequency structure of information 942 is altered thus matching the actual tone interspacing and OFDM symbol transmission timing being used by the sector base station attachment point and thus providing for synchronized operations.<br><br>
Figure 11 is a drawing of a flowchart 1100 illustrating an exemplary method of operating an exemplary wireless communications system with different bandwidths in different portions of the system in accordance with the present invention. In step 1102 operation is started, and base stations are powered on and initialized. Operation proceeds from step 1102 to step 1104 and step 1110.<br>
In step 1104, a base station is operated to select bandwidth for each sector. For example, a base station may select to use 1.38 MHz BW for each of three sectors out of a total allocated BWof5MHz. In some embodiments, different bandwidths may be used in different sectors   In some embodiments, the bandwidth for at least some sectors is predetermined and fixed. In some embodiments, the bandwidth for at least some sectors is variable and may be changed during operation, e.g., to account for different loading levels at different times. In some embodiments, bandwidths are selected from a set of discrete levels. In some embodiments, bandwidth is selected via user input, e.g., system administrator input. Operation proceeds from step 1104 to step 1106. In step 1106, the BS is operated to adjust tone inter-spacing and OFDM symbol timing for the selected bandwidth for each sector. For example, a system may use a fixed number of tones (e.g., 113), and the tone inter-spacing may be adjusted from a nominal setting of 11.25KHz (corresponding to a nominal BW of 1.27 MHz) to a new setting of 12.25KHz (corresponding to a BW of 1.38 MHz), while the OFDM symbol time may be adjusted in concert down from a nominal value proportionally. Operation proceeds from step 1106 to step 1108. In step 1108, the base station is operated on a sector basis to generate and transmit beacon signals, e.g., periodically, at least some of said beacon signals including band characteristic information. For example, a sector base station transmitter may generate and transmit, e.g., periodically, a beacon signal using a tone with index = x, and a tone with index = x+10; the difference in tones of 10 index units may fixed throughout the system, irrespective of the bandwidth selected or cell/sector or operation. The value of x may be an identifier used to associate the beacon signal with a specific base station and sector. Alternately, the base station sector transmitter may transmit two beacon signals at different times, e.g., alternately, a first beacon signal with tone index x, and a second beacon signal with tone index x+10. In addition in some embodiments, the base station may transmit a reference beacon signal including a reference tone, e.g., the first tone of the band. In some embodiments, the base station may alternate between transmitting different types of beacon signals.<br><br>
In step 11 10, a wireless terminal is powered on and operated to receive beacon signals. The beacon signals are high power signals, with all or most of the sector transmitter energy concentrated on one or a few tones. The beacons signals are readily detected by the WTs and the WTs need not have precise timing synchronization with the BSs in order to process at least some of the beacon signals. For example, the WT may currently be set on a nominal bandwidth of 1.27MHz with its associated inter-tone spacing and OFDM symbol transmission timing; however the received beacon may be operating with a inter-tone spacing and OFDM timing corresponding to 1.38MHZ BW. Operation proceeds from step 1110 to step 1112. In step 1112, the WT is operated to process beacon signals. In sub-step 1114, the WT determines power levels of the received beacon signals. In sub-step 1116, the WT is operated to determine BS/sector band characteristic information via sub-steps 1118 and 1120. In sub-step 1118, the WT determines tone-interspacing. For example, consider that an exemplary first type beacon signal will include two tones separated by 10 tone index units irrespective of the bandwidth employed or the sector cell of the system. The WT, knowing this fixed relationship, can measure the separation in terms of frequency and calculate the inter-tone spacing or the width of a single tone, and knowing the number of tones used in the system, can calculate the bandwidth employed by the sector base station. In sub-step 1120, the WT determines the frequency of a base tone or reference tone for the band, e.g., from a reference type beacon signal.<br>
Operation proceeds from step 1112 to step 1122. In step 1122, for each BS/sector with corresponding processed beacon signal(s), the WT is operated to calculate clock adjustment information, e.g., an offset or scaling from the current setting of the WT or from a nominal setting for the WT. Operation proceeds from step 1122 to step 1124. In step 1124, the WT is operated to select an attachment point, e.g., the sector base station corresponding to the strongest received beacon signals. Operation proceeds from step 1124 to step 1126. In step 1126, the WT is operated to adjust its clock module to adapt to the tone interspacing and bandwidth of the BS sector transmitter/receiver that has been selected in step 1124 using clock adjustment information from step 1122. In step 1126, the WT 900 may also be synchronized with the BS sector transmitter/receiver so that regular signals, e.g., uplink and downlink traffic channel signals may be processed.<br>
Although described in the context of beacon signals, band characteristic information, in accordance with the invention, may be conveyed and determined from other broadcast signals such as, e.g., pilot signals.<br><br>
In some embodiments, other components of the band characteristics may be changed, in addition to or in place of tone interspacing, to utilize bandwidth. For example, the number of OFDM tones used in a given band may change from one area of the system to another area. In such an embodiment, broadcast signals, e.g., beacon signals, may be used, in accordance with the present invention, to convey such information to the WTs, so that the WTs can adapt to correspond to the bandwidth, structure and format used by that sector of the base station to which the WT desires to attach.<br>
Figure 12 is a drawing of a flowchart 1200 of an exemplary communications method in accordance with the present invention for use in a wireless communications system, e.g., an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing system (OFDM) spread spectrum multiple access wireless communications system including a plurality of base stations and a plurality of wireless terminals, e.g., mobile nodes. The exemplary method starts in step 1201, where a plurality of base stations in the system are powered on and initialized. Operation proceeds from start step 1201 to steps 1202, 1204, and 1206. Steps 1202 and 1204 are performed in parallel. Step 1206 is performed in response to a mobile node handoff initiation, e.g., from a mobile node, from a base station, or from another node such as a centralized control node in the wireless communications system.<br>
In step 1202, a first OFDM transmitter located in a first base station is operated to transmit downlink signals on a first number of tones distributed uniformly in a first frequency band. Step 1202 includes sub-step 1208 and sub-step 1210. In sub-step 1208, the first base station is operated to use a first set of stored control channel structure information to control the transmission by said first transmitter of at least some control signals according to a predetermined recurring transmission pattern. In sub-step 1210, the first base station is operated to generate symbol transmission timing control signals to control the duration of symbols transmitted by said first transmitter.<br>
In step 1204, a second OFDM transmitter located in a second base station, said second base station being different from said first base station, is operated to transmit downlink signals on a second number of tones distributed uniformly in a second frequency band which is wider than said first frequency band, said second number of tones being the same as the first number of tones. In some embodiments, the first number of tones is at least 10 tones. For example in<br><br>
some embodiments, the first number of tones is 113 tones.  In another exemplary embodiment the first number of tones is 339 tones. Step 1204 includes sub-step 1212 and sub-step 1214. In sub-step 1212, the second base station is operated to use a second set of stored control channel structure information to control the transmission of at least some control signals according to a predetermined recurring transmission pattern. In sub-step 1214, the second base station is operated to generate symbol transmission timing control signals to control the duration of symbols transmitted by said second transmitter, the duration of symbols transmitted by said second transmitter being shorter than the duration of symbols transmitted by said first transmitter.<br>
In some embodiments, the period of the recurring transmission pattern used by the first and second transmitters is different by an amount proportional to a difference in symbol transmission durations, where the difference in symbol transmission durations is the difference in the duration of symbol transmission times at said first transmitter to the duration of symbol transmission times at said second transmitter.<br>
In various embodiments, the symbol duration of symbols transmitted by said first transmitter includes a cyclic prefix portion and a symbol body portion, and the symbol duration of symbols transmitted by said second transmitter are shorter than the duration of symbols transmitted by said first transmitter, and the ratio of i) the duration of the body portion of symbols transmitted by said first transmitter to ii) the duration of the body portion of symbols transmitted by said second transmitter is the same as the ratio of iii) the bandwidth of the second frequency band to iv) the bandwidth of the first frequency band. In some such embodiments, the ratio of the i) the duration of the cyclic prefix portion of symbols transmitted by said first transmitter to ii) the duration of the cyclic prefix portion of symbols transmitted by said second transmitter is also the same as the ratio of iii) the bandwidth of the second frequency band to iv) the bandwidth of the first frequency band.<br>
In some embodiments, the ratio of i) the duration of the symbols transmitted by the first transmitter to ii) the duration of the symbols transmitted by the second transmitter is equal to the ratio of iii) the frequency spacing between two adjacent tones transmitted by said second transmitter to iv) the frequency spacing between two adjacent tones transmitted by said first transmitter. In some such embodiment the ratio is less than 1.3 to 1.<br><br>
In some embodiments, one of the first and second transmitters operates in a portion of the a 2.5 GHz frequency band and the other one of said first and second transmitters operates in a portion of a 450 MHz frequency band.<br>
In step 1206, base stations are operated to perform mobile node handoff operations and continue communications corresponding to ongoing communications sessions. Step 1206 includes sub-step 1216 and sub-step 1218. In sub-step 1216, the first base station is operated to complete a mobile node handoff operation to said second base station. In step 1218, the second base station is operated to transmit packets to said mobile node corresponding to a communications session that was ongoing at said first base station prior to said handoff.<br>
In various embodiments, the same recurring control signaling pattern for uplink control signaling is used in each of the first and second base stations.<br>

Figure 14, which comprises the combination of Figure 14A and Figure 14B, is a flowchart of an exemplary method of operating a wireless communications device in accordance with the present invention. For example, the wireless communications device may be a wireless terminal, e.g., mobile node, in an exemplary OFDM spread spectrum multiple access wireless communications system. The exemplary method starts in step 1402, where the wireless communication device has been powered on, initialized and established a wireless communications link with a first base station. Operation proceeds from step 1402 to step 1404.<br>
In step 1404, the wireless communications device is operated, during a first period of time, to transmit uplink signals on a first number of tones distributed uniformly in a first frequency band to a first base station, the first frequency band being an uplink frequency band associated with the first base station. In some embodiments, the first number of tones is at least ten. In some embodiments, the first number of tones is 113. In some embodiments, the uplink signals transmitted during said first period of time are OFDM symbols. For example, an OFDM symbol may include the set of uplink tones of the first frequency band, e.g., a set of 113 contiguous uniformly distributed tones. Continuing with the example, for the communications device, for a given uplink OFDM symbol transmitted, the wireless communications device may have been allocated a sub-set of the tones on which to place modulation symbols having a nonzero energy level, while on the other tones no energy is placed. For example, the sub-set of tones may include a dedicated control channel tone and, at times, additional tones, e.g., 14 tones associated with a traffic channel segment. In this way, for a given OFDM symbol transmission time period, the set of uplink tones in the first band can be partitioned among a plurality of wireless communications devices. Continuing with the example, consider that the uplink tones<br><br>
of the first frequency band are frequency hopped in accordance with an uplink tone hopping sequence. If the wireless communications device is allocated one pre-hopping logical tone for a dedicated control channel, over time, the logical tone will correspond to different ones of the physical tones in the first frequency band. In this way, over the first time period the wireless communications device uses the set of tones of the first frequency band-Step 1404 includes sub-step 1410 and sub-step 1412. In sub-step 1410, the wireless communications device is operated to use a set of stored structure information including stored control channel structure information to control the transmission of said uplink signals during the first period of time, at least some control signals occurring according to a predetermined recurring transmission pattern. In sub-step 1412, the wireless communications device is operated to generate symbol transmission timing control signals to control the duration of symbols transmitted during the first period of time.<br>
Operation proceeds from step 1404 to step 1406. In step 1406, during a third period of time, the wireless communications device is operated to perform operations supporting connectivity with a second base station, e.g., as part of a registration process and/or a handoff process. Step 1406 includes sub-steps 1414, 1416, 1418, and 1420. In sub-step 1414, the wireless communications device is operated to switch its receiver from a downlink frequency band used by said first base station, e.g., a fourth frequency band, to a third frequency band, said third frequency band being a downlink frequency band used by a second base station. Operation proceeds from sub-step 1414 to sub-step 1416. In sub-step 1416, the wireless communication device!s receiver is operated to receive signals from the third frequency band, said third frequency band having a known frequency relationship to a second frequency band used by said second base station, said second frequency band being an uplink frequency band. In some embodiments, the received signals from the third frequency band include at least one high power beacon signal. In some such embodiments, the beacon signal includes at most two tones and is transmitted at a power level at least twice as high as the highest power level used by either of the first or second base stations to transmit user data. In some embodiments, the beacon signal is a narrowband signal. Operation proceeds from sub-step 1416 to sub-step 1418. In sub-step 1418, the wireless communications device determines from a signal received in said third frequency band, e.g., the beacon signal, a spacing between adjacent tones, said spacing to be used in said second frequency band. Operation proceeds from sub-step 1418 to sub-step 1420. In sub-step<br><br>
1420, the wireless communications device is operated to adjust transmitter symbol timing to produce tones having said determined tone spacing.<br>
Operation proceeds from step 1406, via connecting node A 1407, to step 1408. In step 1408 the wireless communications device is operated during a second period of time to transmit uplink signals, e.g., OFDM symbols, on a second number of tones distributed uniformly in the second frequency band which is wider than the first frequency band, said second number of tones being the same as the first number of tones. Step 1408 includes sub-step 1422 and sub-step 1424.<br>
In sub-step 1422 the wireless communications device is operated to use the set of stored structure information including stored control channel structure information to control the transmission of said uplink signals during the second period of time, at least some control signals occurring according to the same predetermined recurring transmission pattern used during the first period of time. In some embodiments, the period of the recurring transmission pattern used during said first and second time periods is different by an amount proportional to the ratio of i) the bandwidth of the second frequency band to ii) the bandwidth of the first frequency band.<br>
In sub-step 1424, the wireless communications device is operated to generate symbol transmission timing control signals to control the duration of symbols transmitted during the second period of time, the duration of symbols transmitted by said wireless communications device during said second period of time being shorter than the duration of symbols transmitted by said wireless communications device during said first period of time.<br>
In various embodiments, the symbol duration of symbols transmitted by said wireless communications device during said first time period includes a cyclic prefix portion and a symbol body portion, and the symbol duration of symbols transmitted by said wireless communications device during said second period of time are shorter than the duration of symbols transmitted by wireless communications device during said first period* and the ratio of i) the duration of the body portion of symbols transmitted during said first period of time to ii) the duration of the body portion of symbols transmitted during said second period of time is the same as the ratio of iii) the bandwidth of the second frequency band to iv) the bandwidth of the first frequency band. In some such embodiments, the ratio of the i) the duration of the cyclic<br><br>
prefix portion of symbols transmitted during said first penod of time to ii) the duration of the cyclic prefix portion of symbols transmitted during said second penod of time is also the same as the ratio of iii) the bandwidth of the second frequency band to iv) the bandwidth of the first frequency band.<br>
