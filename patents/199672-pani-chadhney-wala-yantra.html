				<td>The present invention relates to a device, which is useful in raising level of flowing/still water. This provides an alternative to water pump, which consumes considerable amount of non-renewable energy.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Water lifting is regular phenomenon seen in many applications. For large variety of applications like supply of drinking water, irrigation purposes, mine water drainage, handling mixture of water &amp;soiids like pebbles, course gravel clinker, boulder ash, rock chips &amp; silts etc.for raising level of liquid various pumps are used.<br>
Various kind of pumps viz. Dynamic pressure pumps (centrifugal, turbine, propeller, jet) &amp; positive displacement pumps {reciprocating (piston plunger type, diaphragm), rotary (gear, lobe, vane, screw, rotary)} are already well known in the art. Each pump has its operating characteristics that limit its practical applications.<br>
Basically pumps convert the mechanical energy supplied to them in form of electric energy in to hydraulic energy, which is mainly in form of pressure energy. In fact, electric power, which is supplied, to the pump or more specifically speaking to its shaft raises level of liquid.<br>
Simple expression that may be pointed is <br>
P = Power required to raise level of liquid. p =Density of the liquid which is being lifted g= acceleration due to gravity h= height through which water is lifted<br>
In one of the embodiments of the invention emphasis is on change of mode of power supply to the pump shaft. Conventional methods for power supply to raise level of liquid from wells, deep boring source of river are electric motor or diesel generator motor sets. Acute availability of electricity in remote areas &amp; shortage of diesel resuhs in crop loss at large scale. Moreover electricity &amp;diesel are costly. Moreover with the use of diesel pollution problem persists. Also all the conventional appliances for power supply require constant maintenance.<br>
Summary of the invention:<br>
The above-mentioned disadvantages are obviated with the help of present invention. This invention is particularly useful in remote areas where electric supply is limited and diesel appears costly.<br>
Therefore an object of the one of the preferred embodiment of the invention is to supply cheaply &amp; efficiently power required raising the level of liquid without any electricity &amp;diesel.<br>
Also an object of the one of the preferred embodiment is to supply liquid in an effective way, which is non-pollutant to environment.<br>
Also another object of the one of the preferred embodiment of the invention is to use animal energy (to run shaft), which is available in abundance in remote areas.<br>
Also another object of the one of the preferred embodiment of the invention is to it is safe to handle, it is safe to handle, it requires comparatively less maintenance then conventional power supplying devices.<br>
Statement of invention<br>
This invention belongs to, a water level lifting device comprising: foundation (3) being made up of suitable material to support hollow pipe shaft (1) being made up of suitable material both in horizontal and vertical position; a wheel (9) being made up of same size shaft as that of hollow shaft, of suitable material, integrally mounted on said hollow pipe shaft; bearing (4) &amp;foundation bearing (6) being integrally mounted on said hollow pipe shaft: a rubber pipe/ plastic pipe (7) connecting said hollow pipe shaft to water reservoir(8); a pulley (10) being integrally fixed on said hollow pipe shaft.<br>
Brief description of the accompanying drawings:<br>
Further features &amp;advantages of the invention become clear from the following description &amp;drawings<br>
Fig.l: Perspective view, showing water-lifting device in the vertical position of the shaft Fig.2: Perspective view, showing water-lifting device in the horizontal, position of the shaft<br>
Fig.3: Perspective view, showing water-lifting device in the vertical position of the shaft, without using a wheel<br>
Detailed description:<br>
The nature of the invention, its objective and further advantages residing in the same will be apparent from the following description made with reference to the non-limiting exemplary embodiment of the invention represented in the accompanying drawings. The various parts, which are integral to the device, can be enumerated as follows:<br>
1 .Pipe shaft<br>
2.	Round wheel made up of pipe<br>
3.	Foundation frame<br>
4.	Bearing<br>
5.	Water seal<br>
6.	Foundation bearing<br>
7.	Rubber or plastic pipe<br>
8.	Water reservoir 9 L- shaped tubes lO.PuUey<br>
Pipe shaft position can be both horizontal or vertical, in both the cases an iron frame of suitable dimensions is prepared to support shaft, the size of this foundation frame is determined by the nature &amp;amount of the various type of stresses, due to rotation<br>
of shaft. Sometimes if the water is to be lifted through a larger height, then foundation can also be made up of concrete, water pipe can be embedded in this. In both horizontal or vertical position of shaft a bearing is used to support the shaft&amp; to guide or confining its motion, while preventing in the direction of applied load. Since there is a relative motion between the bearing &amp;moving element, there is a power loss or energy loss due to friction&amp; if surfaces actually touch each other wear may take place. Hence bearing used is selected on the basis so that bearing performs its function with minimum loss of energy (so that outlet discharge for a particular head is not compensated in friction.).Moreover some times if the hollow shaft size becomes very large i.e. diameter becomes very large . then shaft becomes bulky, moreover there will be a loss of friction , due to which there will be an excessive friction losses , which can be avoided by projecting two ends of hollow shaft somewhat more so that they becomes lean (by reducing diameter of the shafts), now shaft with lean diameter rotates in the bearing , hence friction loss is avoided, because bearings are placed at the ends.<br>
The pipe shaft is hollow, so that water is flows from bottom to upwards, this shaft at bottom end is connected to rubber pipe and at the other end it is being closed. From rubber pipe end of the hollow shaft water is sucked. There is a wheel, which can be made of same size pipe as that of hollow pipe shaft or dilTereni size pipe as that of hollow pipe shaft. This wheel is having holes in it, which are through. There are L -Shaped pipes that passes through these holes. On hollow shaft end these pipes are fixed either through welding or through any conventional mean to hollow pipe shaft. While their L-shaped portion protrude outwards the wheel .In one of the preferred embodiment   there can be possibility as shown in figure 3 that no wheel is used , or there can be a simple tube circumscribing all the L shaped pipes ; this time all the pipes solving the necessity of making the device more balanced .In one of the preferred embodiment rubber pipe can be connected to hollow pipe shaft end through a non return valve or through a water seal, so that water rises above the level ol'this non return valve &amp;can not return back, moreover water seal is essential in horizontal position of shafts there being change of direction for the water viz. from vertical to horizontal. The shaft may be rotated by various means. In one of the preferred embodiment a pulley can be integrally mounted on hollow shaft. This pulley can be rotated by various means such as gear drive, belt drive. In one of the<br>
preferred embodiment there can be cattle, which is to be used to run the pulley. &amp; infact this is great achievement of the device that this is capable of supplying water even at low shaft speed. In one of the preferred embodiment there may be a crank, which can be used to rotate the shaft.<br>
Working of water lifting device:<br>
l.Priming:<br>
In all cases device should be primed before any lift is to be achieved, for priming water is poured from L shaped tubes, so that water reaches to water seal or to non-return valve. With priming all air pockets are ended, this avoids any kind of negative pressure, which could have damaged the proper head building.<br>
2.Pressure building/lifting of water:<br>
As hollow pipe shaft is rotated by any means viz. with the help of any animal, belt drive or gear drive, or through crank effort applied on o the wheel being mounted on the pipe shaft, wheel which is integral to hollow pipe shaft stats rotating.water starts rising in hollow shaft. The cycle goes on till shaft is rotated, after some times water starts coming out of L shaped pipes.<br>
Although the invention is illustrated and described with reference to one preferred embodiment thereof, it is to be expressly understood that it is in no way limited to the disclosure of such a preferred embodiment, but is capable of numerous modifications within the scope of the appended claims.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
