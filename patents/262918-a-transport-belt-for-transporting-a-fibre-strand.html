				<td>2 BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
A transport belt for transporting a fibre strand<br>
The present invention relates to a transport belt for transporting a fibre strand to be pneumatically condensed, said transport belt comprises at least in an area guiding the fibre strand an air-permeable woven material made of synthetic filaments, whereby at least a percentage of the synthetic filaments consists of at least one base material containing deposits of another material.<br>
When a drafted fibre strand is imparted a spinning twist directly downstream of the front roller pair of the drafting unit, a so-called spinning triangle occurs at the nipping line of the front roller pair. This comes about because the drafted fibre strand leaves the drafting unit having a certain width and is twisted to a thread having a relatively small diameter. The spinning triangle comprises lateral fibres, which are not properly bound into the twisted thread and thus contribute little or nothing to the tensile strength of the spun thread. In recent times, a condensing zone has been arranged downstream of the drafting zone of the drafting unit, which condensing zone is in turn bordered by a nipping line. Only downstream thereof is the thread imparted its spinning twist The fibres are bundled or condensed in the condensing zone, whereby the fibre strand is so narrow when it leaves the nipping line furthest down-stream that the feared spinning triangle is no longer noticeably disadvantageous. The spun thread is then more even, tear-resistant and less hairy.<br>
A large variety of arrangements are known for condensing a fibre strand. Many of these arrangements function with an air-permeable transport belt, which transports the fibre strand to be condensed over a suction slit in a sliding manner An arrangement of this type, for example, is disclosed in German published patent application 199 11 333 A1   This publication includes a description of the transport belt as possibly being a woven material containing synthetic filaments<br>
A transport belt of this type is subject to very high wear, caused by the sliding movement it makes so that the belt must be replaced from time to time   Fragments of broken fibres and dust from the fibre strand to be condensed which may get in under the transport belt, have hereby an additional abrasive and vvear-inducing effect.<br><br>
3<br>
A transport belt is known from German published patent application 10 2004 005 953 A1, in which the physical properties of the woven material of the said belt are specifically influenced by deposits incorporated into the synthetic filaments. A transport belt of the above mentioned typed is described, in which at least a percentage of the synthetic filaments is interspersed at random with cut carbon fibres. The aim of the deposits of of carbon fibres is to prevent electrostatic charging of the transport belt.<br>
It has been shown, however, that the known measures do not effect a reduction in the amount of wear, but rather instead that transport belts of this type wear very quickly and do not achieve a sufficiently long service life. The applicant presumes that the carbon fibres are too soft and that an unfavourable material interaction occurs, in particular with the most frequently processed fibre materials, which interaction in fact actually favours wear. Fibre strands of cotton are very often condensed with such arrangements, the main chemical element of which is carbon. The transport belt containing the interspersed carbon fibres is therefore permanently in contact with the fibres, which are also mainly made of carbon, as well as with small and minute fragments of broken fibres. It would appear that the combination of materials, that is, the carbon in the fragments of broken fibres and the carbon in the carbon fibres interspersed in the synthetic filaments, accelerate the wear of the transport belt greatly. It has been observed that transport belts with carbon fibre deposits wear faster than transport belts made of synthetic filaments without deposits.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to create a new type of transport belt for application in pneumatic condensing which wears less quickly and thus has a longer service life<br>
This object has been achieved in accordance with the present invention in that a percentage of the deposits in the synthetic filaments of the transport belt consists of an abrasion-resistant material<br>
The application of an abrasion-resistant material in the form of deposits in the synthetic filaments of the transport belt effects a protection against wear in the transport belt in an advantageous way. The material of the synthetic filaments is not abraded so quickly when it slides over the adjacent components.  The deposits consist advantageously of an abrasive-resistant material which contains a low level<br><br>
4<br>
of carbon   By means of applying low-carbon deposits, the above mentioned disadvantageous interaction between the high-carbon cotton fibres can be avoided. It is in particular advantageous to choose mineral hard materials, ceramic or glass for the deposits<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention it can be advantageous to use a combination of various materials for the deposits in the synthetic filaments, in order to unite different specifications For example, it can be provided that, in addition to wear-reducing deposits in the form of glass fibres, for example, low percentages of carbon fibres are applied, in order to simultaneously achieve the advantages of discharging electrostatic charges.<br>
The abrasive-resistant materials to be interspersed in the synthetic filaments can have various forms It can be hereby provided that the abrasive-resistant materials in the form of a granulate are interspersed with the synthetic material during the production of the filaments. The grain size of the granulate amounts advantageously to only a fraction of the subsequent filament diameter. The deposits are, however, advantageously essentially ball-shaped, as then the particles at the surface of the synthetic filaments have a less aggressive effect on the materials of the sliding surfaces which, during operation, are in contact with the transport belt<br>
In particular when the desposits are of glass, it is advantageous to provide the deposits in the form of glass fibres    It is hereby advantageous, when the length of the glass fibres, in relation to their diameter, is not overly long, so that the level of flexural stiffness of the synthetic filaments and thus of the entire transport belt is not too high As the transport belt is subject, as a rule, to alternating bending loads, it is necessary that the transport belt possesses sufficient flexibility   This level of flexibility is advantageously then achieved when the deposits, for example, in the form of glass fibres, have a ratio of length to diameter of approximately 1000 A particularly high level of flexibility can be achieved by means of a ratio of length to diameter of approximately 100<br>
It should be noted at this point that in the terminology of this patent application, the term 'pneumatic condensing  includes such arrangements in which apart from the suction airstream, also other means, for example a transport component directed against a slanted suction slit can assist in the condensing operation. <br>

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
These and further objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become more readily apparent from the following detailed description thereof when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings wherein.<br>
Figure 1 shows an arrangement for condensing a drafted, still twist-free fibre strand, for which the transport belt according to the present invention can be applied,<br>
Figure 2 shows a view in the direction of the arrow II of Figure 1, whereby the individual rollers have been omitted for the purposes of clarity.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
Of a spinning machine, in particular a ring spinning machine, only the area of an arrangement 1 for condensing a drafted but still twist-free fibre strand 2 is shown in Figures 1 and 2. The arrangement 1 is located directly downstream of a drafting unit 3, of which only the front roller pair 4, as well as an apron roller pair having a lower apron 6 and a top apron 7 and being arranged upstream of the front roller pair 4 in Transport direction A, are shown. The front roller pair 4 comprises a driven front bottom roller 8 as well as a front pressure roller 9 flexibly pressed thereagainst. The front roller pair 4 defines a front nipping line 10, which forms the end of the drafting zone of the drafting unit 3.<br>
In the drafting unit 3, a sliver or a roving 11 is drafted in transport direction A to the desired degree of fineness in the known way. The drafting process ends at the front nipping line 10 and from this point on the drafted but still twist-free fibre strand 2 is formed. In order to reduce the known and disadvantageous spinning triangle, the fibre strand 2 is condensed directly downstream of the front nipping line 10 in a condensing zone 12 The arrangement 1 provided for the condensing comprises an air-permeable transport belt 13, which transports the fibre strand 2 to be condensed through the condensing zone 12 The arrangement 1 comprises further a suction channel 14, which is designed as a hollow profile in which a vacuum prevails, and which can extend over a plurality of spinning positions The suction channel 14 is designed on its side facing the condensing zone 12 as a sliding surface 15 for guiding the transport belt 13<br>
In the sliding surface 15 a such on slit 16 is located which is arranged slightly diagonally to the direction of motion of the transport belt 13, so that one lateral edge of the suction slit 16 is designed as a fibre guiding edge 17 in relation to the fibre<br><br>
6<br>
strand 2 to be condensed The fibre strand 2 travels along this fibre guiding edge 17 during the condensing process, whereby the fibres in the fibre strand 2 are bundled or condensed transversely to the direction of motion of the transport belt 13, during which the fibre strand 2 is rolled in somewhat The suction channel 14 is connected via a vacuum conduit 18, which is located at a distance from the suction slit 16, to a vacuum source (not shown). Insofar as the suction channel 14 extends over a plurality of spinning positions, only one vacuum conduit 18 needs to be present per suction channel 14.<br>
The condensing zone 12 is bordered on its exit side by a nipping roller 19, which presses the fibre strand 2 and the transport belt 13 onto the sliding surface 15 and thereby defines a delivery nipping line 20, which functions as a twist block with regard to the spinning twist to be applied. The nipping roller 19 drives the transport belt 13 and is in turn driven by the front pressure roller 9 via a transfer wheel 21, for example, in the form of a toothed wheel.<br>
Downstream of the delivery nipping line 20 the forming thread 22 receives its spinning twist, in that it is fed in delivery direction B to a twist device (not shown), for example a ring spindle. The delivery nipping line 20 functions as a twist block in regard to the spinning twist, so that the spinning twist does not extend back into the condensing zone 12.<br>
On the side of the suction channel 14 facing away from the suction slit 16, the transport belt 13 is tensioned by means of a tensioning element 23, which can be designed as a stationary rod or also as a guiding roller. The tensioning element 23 is hereby so arranged that the transport belt 13 lies with a light pressure on the front bottom roller 8. As the transport belt 13 and the front bottom roller 8 travel in opposite directions to one another at the point of contact, the transport belt 13 is cleaned of any adhering fibre fly.<br>
As can be seen in Figure 2, the initial area 24 of the suction slit 16 comprises an extension which permits the fibre strand 2, traversing slightly in transverse direction to be reliably taken hold of by the suction slit 16 The traverse motion serves in particular to ensure that the front pressure roller 9 has a longer lifetime<br>
The transport belt 13 consists in particular in its area which guides the fibre strand 2 of a woven material 25, which is woven from synthetic filaments 25 The synthetic filaments 26 of the woven material 25 experience wear because of the sliding friction over the sliding surface 15 and in particular also under the nipping roller 19 at the<br><br>
7<br>
delivery nipping line 20 This wear is increased in that fibre fragments of the fibre strand 2 settle in the woven material 25 of the transport belt 13 and also get in under the transport belt 13 on the sliding surface 15 The transport belt 13 is thus destroyed over time and must be replaced after a certain length of running time<br>
It is the aim of the present invention to reduce the wear of the transport belt 13 and to increase the operating time and the lifetime of the transport belt 13. It is provided for this purpose that at least a percentage of the synthetic filaments 26 of the woven material 25 contains deposits of an abrasive-resistant material. It is advantageous that the deposits are made from a mineral hard material, glass or ceramic   Based hereby on the above described findings of the applicant, attention should be paid to the fact that the deposits do not contain to high a percentage of carbon overall.<br><br>
Also advantageous are deposits made of an abrasive-resistant material, which is essentially ball-shaped and has a sufficiently small particle size in comparison to the diameter of the synthetic filaments 26   The essentially ball-shaped deposits provide good protection against wear of the transport belt 13 while simultaneously having good sliding properties in relation to the sliding surface 15 of the suction channel 14<br><br>
