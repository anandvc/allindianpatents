				<td>The present invention relates to novel active compound combinations which comprise, as active compounds, in each case two compounds from the series of the chloronicotinyl insecticides and which have very good insecticidal properties.<br>
It is already known that chloronicotinyl insecticides can be employed for controlling animal pests, in particular insects. The chloronicotinyl insecticides include the following compounds:<br>
imidacloprid, of the formula (I)<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
(cf. EP 0 192 060), clothianidin, of the formula (II),<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
(EP 0 376 279)<br>
dinotefuran, of the formula (III),<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
(EP 0 649 845) <br>
(EP 0 302 389)<br>
While the activity ot" these compounds is good, it leaves something to be desired in some cases when the compounds are employed at low application rates or against specific pests.<br>
15 It has now been found that mixtures comprising in each case at least two and in particular precisely two compounds from the series of the chloronicotinyl insecticides, in particular those of the formulae (I) to (VII), act synergistically and are suitable for controlling animal pests. Owing to this<br><br>
synergism, markedly lower amounts of active compound can be used, i.e. the activity of the mixture is greater than the activity of the individal components.<br>
The ratio between the two active compounds employed and the total amount of mixture to be applied depends on the species and the occurrence of the insects or Acarina and can be varied within a wide range The optimal ratios and total application rates can be determined for each application by test series.<br>
The following mixtures according to the invention may be mentioned specifically:<br>

All plants and plant parts can be treated in accordance with the invention. Plants are understood as meaning, in the present context, all plants and plant populations, such as desired and undesired wild plants or crop plants (including naturally occurring crop plants). Crop plants may be plants which can be obtained by conventional breeding and optimization methods or by biotechnological and genetic engineering methods or by combinations of these methods, including the transgenic plants and including the plant varieties capable or not capable of being protected by plant breeders' rights. Plant plants are understood as meaning all aerial and subterranean parts and organs of the plants, such as shoot, leaf, flower and root, examples which may be mentioned being leaves, needles, stalks, stems, flowers, fruiting bodies, fruits and seeds, and also roots, tubers and rhizomes. The plant parts also include harvested material and vegetative and generative propagation material, for example cuttings, tubers, rhizomes, slips and seeds.<br>
What may be emphasized in this context is the particularly advantageous effect of the compositions according to the invention with regard to their use in cereal plants such as, for example, wheat, oats, barley, spelt, triticale and rye, but also in maize, sorghum and millet, rice, sugar cane, soya beans, sunflowers, potatoes, cotton, oilseed rape, canola, tobacco, sugar beet, fodder beet, asparagus, hops and fruit plants (comprising pome fruit such as, for example, apples and pears, stone fruit such as, for example, peaches, nectarines, cherries, plums and apricots, citrus fruits such as, for example, oranges, grapefruits, limes, lemons, kumquats, tangerines and satsumas, nuts such as, for example, pistachios, almonds, walnuts and pecan nuts, tropical fruits such as, for example, mango, paw-paw, pineapple, dates and bananas, and grapes) and vegetables (comprising leaf vegetables such as, for example, endives, corn salad, Florence fennel, lettuce, cos lettuce, Swiss chard, spinach and chicory for salad use, cabbages such as, for example, cauliflower, broccoli, Chinese leaves, Brassica oleracea (L.) convar. acephala var. sabellica L. (curly kale, feathered cabbage), kohlrabi, Brussels sprouts, red cabbage, white cabbage and savoy cabbage, fruit vegetables such as, for example, aubergines, cucumbers, capsicums, table pumpkins, tomatoes, courgettes and sweetcorn, root vegetables such as, for example celeriac, wild turnips, carrots, including yellow cultivars, Raphanus sativus var. niger and var. radicula, beetroot,<br><br>
scorzonera and celery, legumes such as, for example, peas and beans, and vegetables from the Allium family such as, for example, leeks and onions).<br>
The treatment according to the invention of the plants and plant parts with the active compound combinations is carried out either directly or by treating their environment, habitat or store by the customary treatment methods, for example by dipping, spraying, vaporizing, misting, broadcasting, painting on and, in the case of propagation material, in particular seeds, furthermore by coating with one or more layers.<br>
The mixtures according to the invention are particularly suitable for the treatment of seeds. Thus, most of the damage to crop plants which is caused by pests occurs as early as when the seed is infested during storage and after the seed is introduced into the soil, and during and immediately after germination of the plants. This phase is particularly critical since the roots and shoots of the glowing plants are particularly sensitive and even minor damage can lead to the death of the whole plant. Protecting the seed and the germinating plant by the use of suitable compositions is therefore of particularly great interest.<br>
The control of pests by treating the seed of plants has been known for a long time and is subject-matter of continuous improvements. However, the treatment of seed frequently entails a series of problems which cannot always be solved in a satisfactory manner. Thus, it is desirable to develop methods for protecting the seed and the germinating plant which dispense with the additional application of crop protection products after planting or after emergence of the plants. It is furthermore desirable to optimize the amount of active compound employed in such a way as to provide optimum protection for the seed and the germinating plant from attack by pests, but without damaging the plant itself by the active compound employed. In particular, methods for the treatment of seed should also take into consideration the intrinsic insecticidal properties of transgenic plants in order to achieve optimum protection of the seed and the germinating plant with a minimum of crop protection products being employed.<br>
The present invention therefore in particular also relates to a method for the protection of seed and germinating plants from attack by pests, by treating the seed with a composition according to the invention. The invention likewise relates to the use of the compositions according to the invention for the treatment of seed for protecting the seed and the germinating plant from pests. Furthermore, the invention relates to seed which has been treated with a composition according to the invention so as to afford protection from pests.<br>
One of the advantages of the present invention is that the particular systemic properties of the compositions according to the invention mean that treatment of the seed with these compositions not only protects the seed itself, but also the resulting plant after emergence, from pests. In this<br>
manner, the immediate treatment of the crop at the time of sowing or shortly thereafter can be dispensed with.<br>
A further advantage is the synergistically increased insecticidal activity of the compositions according to the invention in comparison with the respective individual active compound, which exceeds the total of the activity of the two active compounds when applied individually. This makes possible an optimization of the amount of active compound employed.<br>
Furthermore, it must be considered as advantageous that the mixtures according to the invention can also be employed in particular in transgenic seed, the plants arising from this seed being capable of expressing a protein directed against pests. By treating such seed with the compositions according to the invention, certain pests can already be controlled by the expression of the for example insecticidal protein, and, surprisingly, the result in addition is a synergistically complemented activity together with the compositions according to the invention, which, again, increases the efficacy of the protection against attack by pests.<br>
The compositions according to the invention are suitable for protecting seed of any plant variety as already mentioned above which is employed in agriculture, in the greenhouse, in forests, in horticulture or in viticulture. In particular, this takes the form of seed of maize, peanut, canola, oilseed rape, poppy, olive, coconut, cacao, soya beans, cotton, beet (for example sugar beet and fodder beet), rice, sorghum and millet, wheat, barley, oats, rye, sunflower, sugar cane or tobacco. The compositions according to the invention are likewise suitable for treating the seed of fruit plants and vegetables as already mentioned above. The treatment of the seed of maize, soya beans, cotton, wheat and canola or oilseed rape is of particular importance. Thus, for example, the mixture according to the invention which comprises the active compound methiocarb and imidacloprid is particularly suitable for treating the seed of maize.<br>
As already mentioned above, the treatment of transgenic seed with a composition according to the invention is also of particular importance. This takes the form of seed of plants which, as a rule, comprise at least one heterologous gene which governs the expression of a polypeptide with in particular insecticidal properties. In this context, the heterologous genes in transgenic seed may be derived from microorganisms such as Bacillus, Rhizobium, Pseudomonas, Serratia, Trichoderma, Clavibacter, Glomus or Gliocladiwn. The present invention is particularly suitable for the treatment of transgenic seed which comprises at least one heterologous gene orignating from Bacillus sp. and whose gene product shows activity against the European corn borer and/or the corn root worm. It is particularly preferably a heterologous gene derived from Bacillus thuringiensis,<br>
Within the scope of the present invention, the composition according to the invention is applied to the seed either alone or in suitable formulation. Preferably, the seed is treated in a state in which it<br><br>
is stable enough to avoid damage during treatment. In general, the seed may be treated at any point in time between harvest and sowing. The seed usually used has been separated from the plant and freed from cobs, shells, stalks, coats, hairs or the flesh of the fruits.<br>
When treating the seed, care must generally be taken that the amount of the composition according to the invention applied to the seed and/or the amount of further additives is chosen in such a way that the germination of the seed is not adversely affected, or that the resulting plant is not damaged. This must be borne in mind in particular in the case of active compounds which may have phytotoxic effects at certain application rates.<br>
The compositions according to the invention can be applied directly, that is to say without comprising further components and without having been diluted. As a rule, it is preferable to apply the composition to the seed in the form of a suitable formulation. Suitable formulations and methods for the treatment of seed are known to the skilled worker and are described, for example, in the following documents: US 4,272,417 A, US 4,245,432 A, US 4,808,430 A, US 5,876,739 A, US 2003/0176428 A], WO 2002/080675 Al, WO 2002/028186 A2.<br>
The active compound combinations can be converted into the customary formulations, such as solutions, emulsions, wettable powders, suspensions, powders, dusts, pastes, soluble powders, granules, suspoemulsion concentrates, natural and synthetic materials impregnated with active compounds and microencapsulations in polymeric materials.<br>
These formulations are produced in a known manner, for example by mixing the active compounds with extenders, that is, liquid solvents and/or solid carriers, optionally with the use of surface-active agents, that is, emulsifiers and/or dispersants and/or foam formers.<br>
If water is used as extender, auxiliary solvents which can be used are, for example, organic solvents. As liquid solvents, there are suitable in the main: aromatics, such as xylene, toluene or alkylnaphthalenes, chlorinated aromatics or chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons, such as chlorobenzenes, chloroethylenes or methylene chloride, aliphatic hydrocarbons, such as cyclohexane or paraffins, for example mineral oil fractions, mineral and vegetable oils, alcohols, such as butanol or glycol and ethers and esters, ketones, such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone or cyclohexanone, strongly polar solvents, such as dimethylformamide and dimethyl sulphoxide, and water.<br>
As solid carriers there are suitable:<br>
for example ammonium salts and ground natural minerals, such as kaolins, clays, talc, chalk, quartz, attapulgite, montmorillonite or diatomaceous earth, and ground synthetic minerals, such as<br><br>
highly disperse silica alumina and silicates; as solid carriers for granules there are suitable: for example crushed and fractionated natural rocks such as calcite, marble, pumice, sepiolite and dolomite, and synthetic granules of inorganic and organic meals, and granules of organic material such as sawdust, coconut shells, maize cobs and tobacco stalks; as emulsifiers and/or foam formers there are suitable: for example nonionic and anionic emulsifiers, such as polyoxyethylene fatty acid esters, polyoxyethylene fatty alcohol ethers, for example alkylaryl polyglycol ethers, alkylsulphonates, alkyl sulphates, arylsulphonates and protein hydrolysates; as dispersants there are suitable: for example lignosulphite waste liquors and methylcellulose.<br>
Adhesives such as carboxymethylcellulose and natural and synthetic polymers in the form of powders, granules or latices, such as gum arabic, polyvinyl alcohol and polyvinyl acetate, and natural phospholipids, such as cephalins and lecithins, and synthetic phospholipids can be used in the formulations. Further additives may be mineral and vegetable oils.<br>
It is possible to use colorants such as inorganic pigments, for example iron oxide, titanium oxide and Prussian Blue, and organic dyestuffs, such as alizarin dyestuffs, azo dyestuffs and metal phthalocyanine dyestuffs, and trace nutrients such as salts of iron, manganese, boron, copper, cobalt, molybdenum and zinc.<br>
The formulations in general comprise between 0.1 and 95% by weight of active compound, preferably between 0.5 and 90%.<br>
Preferably, the active compound combinations according to the invention comprise no further active compounds apart from the two chloronicotinyl insecticides of the formulae (I) to (VII).<br>
If appropriate, the active compound combinations according to the invention, in commercially available formulations and in the use forms prepared from these formulations, can be present in a mixture with other known active compounds such as insecticides, attractants, sterilants, bactericides, acaricides, nematicides, fungicides, growth regulators or herbicides.

The abovementioned binder can be replaced fully or in part by a fixative (mixture) or a plasticizer (mixture). These additives are intended to prevent volatilization of the active compounds, and also crystallization or precipitation. They preferably replace 0.01 to 30% of the binder (based on 100% of binder employed).<br>
The plasticizers are from the chemical classes of the phthalic esters, such as dibutyl phthalate, dioctyl phthalate or benzyl butyl phthalate, phosphoric esters such as tributyl phosphate, adipic esters such as di-(2-ethylhexyl) adipate, stearates such as butyl stearate or amyl stearate, oleates<br><br>
such as butyl oleate, glycerol ethers or high-molecular-weight glycol ethers, glycerol esters and p-toluenesulphonic esters.<br>
Fixatives are based chemically on polyvinyl alkyl ethers such as, for example, polyvinyl methyl ether or ketones such as benzophenone, ethylenebenzophenone.<br>
The solvent or diluent is, in particular, also water, if appropriate in a mixture with one or more of the abovementioned chemical solvents or diluents, emulsifiers and dispersants.<br>
Particularly effective protection of timber is achieved by industrial-scale impregnating processes, for example the vacuum, the double-vacuum or pressure processes.<br>
If appropriate, the ready-to-use compositions may additionally comprise further insecticides and, if appropriate, additionally one or more fungicides.<br>
The active compound combinations according to the invention can at the same time be empolyed for protecting objects which come into contact with salt water or brackish water, in particular hulls, screens, nets, buildings, moorings and signalling system, against fouling.<br>
Fouling sessile Oligochaeta, such as Serpulidae, and by shells and species from the Ledamorpha group (goose barnacles), such as various Lepas and Scalpellum species, or by species from the Balanomorpha group (acorn barnacles), such as Balanus or Pollicipes species, increases the frictional drag of ships and, as a consequence, leads to a marked increase in operation costs owing to higher energy consumption and additionally frequent residence in the dry dock.<br>
Apart from fouling by algae, for example Ectocarpus sp. and Ceramium sp., in particular fouling by sessile Entomostraka groups, which come under the generic term Cirripedia (cirriped crustaceans), is of particular importance<br>
Surprisingly, it has now been found that the active compound combinations according to the invention have an outstanding antifouling action.<br>
Using the active compound combinations according to the invention allows the use of heavy metals such as, for example, in bis(trialkyltin) sulphides, tri-w-butyltin laurate, tri-«-butyltin chloride, copper(I) oxide, triethyltin chloride, tri-/z-butyl(2-phenyl-4-chlorophenoxy)tin, tributylin oxide, molybdenum disulphide, antimony oxide, polymeric butyl titanate, phenyl-(bispyridine)bismuth chloride, tri-«-butyltin fluoride, manganese ethylenebis-thiocarbamate, zinc dimethyldithiocarabamate, zinc ethylenebisthiocarbamate, zinc salts and copper salts of 2-pyridinethiol 1-oxide, bisdimethyldithiocarbamoyl zinc ethylene-bisthiocarbamate, zinc oxide,<br><br>
copper(I) ethylenebisdithiocarbamate copper thiocyanate, copper naphthenate and tributyltin halides to be dispensed with or the concentration of these compounds to be substantially reduced.<br>
If appropriate, the ready-to-use antifouling paints can additionally comprise other active compounds, preferably algicides, fungicides, herbicides, molluscicides, or other antifouling active compounds.<br>
Preferably suitable components in combinations with the antifouling compositions according to the invention are:<br>
algicides such as<br>
2-<ert-butylamino-4-cyclopropylamino-6-methylthio-l dichlorophen diuron endothal fentin acetate isoproturn methabenzthiazuron oxyfluorfen quinoclamine and terbutryn></ert-butylamino-4-cyclopropylamino-6-methylthio-l>
fungicides such as<br>
benzo[£&gt;]thiophenecarboxylic acid cyclohexylamide S,S-dioxide, dichlofluanid, fluorfolpet, 3-iodo-2-propynyl butylcarbamate, tolylfluanid and azoles such as<br>

The antifouling compositions used comprise the active compound in a concentration of 0.001 to 50% by weight, in particular 0.01 to 20% by weight.<br><br>
Moreover, the antifouling compositions comprise the customary components such as, for example, those described in lingerer, Chem. Ind. 1985, 37, 730-732 and Williams, Antifouling Marine Coatings, Noyes, Park Ridge, 1973.<br>
Besides the algicidal, fungicidal, molluscidal and insecticidal active compounds, antifouling paints comprise, in particular, binders.<br>
Examples of recognized binders are polyvinyl chloride in a solvent system, chlorinated rubber in a solvent system, acrylic resins in a solvent system, in particular in an aqueous system, vinyl chloride/vinyl acetate copolymer systems in the form of aqueous dispersions or in the form of organic solvent systems, butadiene/styrene/acrylonitrile rubbers, drying oils such as linseed oil, resin esters or modified hardened resins in combination with tar or bitumens, asphalt and epoxy compounds, small amounts of chlorine rubber, chlorinated polypropylene and vinyl resins.<br>
If appropriate, paints also comprise inorganic pigments, organic pigments or colorants which are preferably insoluble in salt water. Paints may furthermore comprise materials such as colophonium to allow controlled release of the active compounds. Furthermore, the paints may comprise plasticizers, modifers which affect the rheological properties and other conventional constituents. The compound combinations according to the invention may also be incorporated into self-polishing antifouling systems<br>
The active compound combinations according to the invention are also suitable for controlling animal pests, in particular insects, arachnids and mites, which are found in enclosed spaces such as for example, dwellings, factory halls, offices, drivers' cabins and the like. To control these pests they can be used in insecticidal products for domestic premises, either alone or in combination with other active compounds and auxiliaries. They are active against sensitive and resistant species and against all developmental stages. These pests include:<br>

When employing the active compound combinations according to the invention, the application rates can be varied within a substantial range, depending on the type of application. In the case of the treatment of plant parts, the application rates of active compound combination are generally between 0.1 and 10 000 g/ha, preferably between 10 and 1 000 g/ha.<br>
The good insecticidal activity of the active compound combinations according to the invention can be seen from the examples which follow. While the individual active compounds show weaknesses in their activity, combinations demonstrate an activity which exceeds a simple additive effect.<br>
The activity to be expected for a given combination of two combinations can be calculated as follows (cf. COLBY, S.R.; "Calculating synergistic and antagonistic responses of herbicide combinations", Weeds 15, pages 20-22, 1967);<br>
if<br>
X =	activity in %, destruction in comparison with the untreated control by<br>
compound A (active compound of the formula I) at a concentration of m ppm<br>
and<br>
Y =	activity in  %,  destruction  in  comparison  with  the  untreated  control  by<br>
compound B (active compound of the formula I) at a concentration of n ppm<br><br>
-and<br>
E =	efficacy in %, destraction in comparison with the untreated control when the<br>
mixture A and B is applied at m and n ppm,<br>
then	E = X + Y-     XXY<br>
100<br>
If the actual damage exceeds the calculated figure, the activity of the combination is superadditive, that is to say it demonstrates a synergistic effect.<br>
