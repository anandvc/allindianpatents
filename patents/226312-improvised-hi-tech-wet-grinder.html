				<td>This Invention incorporates an unique drive mechanism, single drive wheel substituting the whole drive mechanism of the conventional models. A motor mounted on a steel frame drives a wheel through a belt, the drive wheel mounted on a bearing and fixed to a bearing shaft, rotating a tapered base stone and a drum. A Cone fixed to the center of the base stone, revolves round the main shaft. Two or more rollers are held on the base stone by a roller shaft placed in the main shaft. As the Base Stone rotates it activates the rollers by virtue of the spring action and a stopper plate guides the movement of the paste to be ground. The profile of the base stone is such that, thickness at the center is maximum and goes on decreasing proportionately, taper being from the center to the periphery, the least thickness being at the periphery.</td>

This Invention relates to a Wet Grinder. Conventional Grinders hitherto known, basically consisted of a Base Stone, upon which one or more roller stones of either cylindrical or conical cross-section would press against and were held together by gravity, spring force or any other suitable means. The relative motion between the base stone and the roller stones consequent in rubbing and rolling action between the contacting surface and thus the grinding of the food particles took place. The main disadvantage in this system was that the constant friction generated between contact surface lead to more wear and tear on the stone surfaces. Further, since rubbing action was dominant in this process, it would create a lot of heat thereby deteriorating the quality of the ground food substance.<br>
In the conventional wet grinders, the base stone and the roller stone/stones would be on one side and the motor adjacently placed and the base stone and the metallic cylinder deriving its rotary motion through a pulley- belt drive. In this "IMPROVISED HI-TECH WET GRINDER" a new concept has been developed in the wet grinder technology in respect of this drive system and assembly, incorporating the access to high technology we have these days, which has resulted in a technically advanced, compact and a more<br><br>
dificient wet dimer, which is versatile in nature, easy to carry, thereby making it portable also. All this has been achieved without compromising on the grinding capacity and quality.<br>
This 'IMPROVISED HI-TECH WET GRINDER' is totally different from the conventional tilting and table-top wet grinders even though the drive is taken from a separately mounted motor by a belt. In all other type of conventional grinders, the drive from the belt is taken by a wheel, which is fixed to a shaft. The shaft has a bearing, which in turn is fixed to a separate bearing housing. On the top of the Bearing Shaft, there will be the flange, which in turn will hold and rotate the base stone. But in 'IMPROVISED HI-TECH WET GRINDER', there is only one drive wheel, which in turn does all the operations of the above.<br>
In this Invention "IMPROVISED HI-TECH WET GRINDER" the Motor (10) is mounted on a steel frame (4). The drive from the motor is transmitted by a belt (7) to the Drive Wheel (5). The Drive Wheel is revolving around the Bearing (9) and fixed to a Bearing Shaft (8). The Drive Wheel rotates the tapered Base Stone (19) and the Drum (20), which is also detachable. In the middle of the Base Stone, a Cone (18) is fixed by a conical washer (17). The Cone is revolving around the Main Shaft (21), which is fixed to the bearing shaft, which is also detachable. Two (or) more Rollers (22) designed according to the profile of the base stone is fixed to the Rollers Holder (24) by a Roller<br><br>
Shaft (23), placed in the Main Shaft. As the Base Stone rotates, it activates the rollers in the fixed position. The rollers have spring action by a spring holder (26), which in turn has a provision to hold the Closer (27), which is also detachable. The movement of the grinding paste is guided by the Stopper Plate (25).<br>
The Motor is driven with capacitor (11) and controlled by push on/off switch (13) and switch cover (14). The motor is cooled by the fan (12) and it is covered by the motor cover (15). The total system is enclosed within the main body (3) and abase plate (2).<br>
IMPROVEMENTS MADE IN THIS IMPROVISED HI-TECH WET GRINDER<br>
When compared with the 'HI-TECH WET GRINDER', as claimed under Patent Application No: 672/MAS/2000, instead of the Gear Drive, the transmission from the motor to the bearing is a direct belt drive. Consequently, two gears and an additional drive wheel are eliminated. The Motor is mounted adjacent to the stone assembly, thereby reducing the total height of the grinder, considerably. Further, design of the motor and shield is much easier in this case.<br>
All these factors contribute in reducing the production cost, apart from easy maintenance and compactness of the IMPROVISED HITECH WET GRINDER',<br><br>
In this 'IMPROVISED HI-TECH WET GRINDER', the bottom stone is designed in such a way that the taper is from the center of the stone towards the periphery. To elaborate on this point, the thickness of the stone is more at the center, which goes on decreasing proportionately as we come to the Periphery. Thus minimum thickness of the base stone is at the peripheral level. This profile of the base stone has resulted in availability of more area for the grinding purpose.<br>
Another advantage of this profile of the base stone is that the ground particles automatically move towards the periphery of the stone, owing to gravitational and centrifugal forces, which facilitates easy collection and removal of the ground paste. More the surface area and faster the paste movement makes the grinding fast. Two or more rollers (22) are kept above the Bottom stone in such a way that the height of the roller axis remains the same at any point on moving from the center of the bottom stone. The roller assembly is detachable in nature, consisting of a Roller Stud, Roller Bush and Spring assembly, which determine the position of the rollers (22) on the Base Stone (19). A spring cover covers the spring, which is an integral part of the Drum lid and a closer knob acts as a holder for the drum lid.<br><br>
The resulting Improvised Hi Tech Wet Grinder is technically very much advanced but at the same time is very simple in operational aspects, compact and totally detachable, thereby facilitating easy packing and carrying.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
