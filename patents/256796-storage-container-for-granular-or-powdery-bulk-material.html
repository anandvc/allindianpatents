Description<br>
The invention relates to an essentially cylindrical<br>
storage container for granular or powdery bulk material<br>
with a lower, generally conical discharge part provided<br>
with a bulk material outlet opening, wherein a controllable<br>
cut-off device is arranged on the outlet opening.<br>
Such storage containers or silos are held upright<br>
typically by a sturdy foundation at a predetermined height<br>
above the ground and usually contain 50 t of bulk material<br>
or more, which is stored for filling tanks mounted on<br>
trucks. To fill the tanks with bulk material, the truck<br>
drives into a precisely predetermined position under the<br>
storage container, in which a filling port of the tank is<br>
located precisely under the cut-off device. Opening the<br>
cut-off device lets the bulk material pour into the tank<br>
due to the force of gravity. For space reasons, the<br>
vertical distance between the cut-off device and the<br>
filling port of the tank should be as small as possible.<br>
Because the truck lowers with the increasing fill state of<br>
the tank, an expandable component; for example, in the form<br>
of a hose, should be inserted between the cut-off device<br>
and filling port.<br>
For economical reasons, the maximum carrying capacity<br>
of the truck and thus the maximum fill state of the tank<br>
should be utilized as much as possible for one filling. For<br>
the truck to be safe in traffic, overfilling of the tank<br>
must be ruled out absolutely. For this purpose, a<br>
preferably electronic controller must detect the current<br><br>
fill state of the tank and must trigger an immediate<br>
closing of the cut-off device when the maximum value is<br>
reached.<br>
For detecting the fill state, the weight of the bulk<br>
material mass in the tank can be used. Therefore, a vehicle<br>
scale, on which the truck stands in the mentioned position,<br>
is installed in the ground under the storage container.<br>
Such a measure, however, means considerable expense, which<br>
also becomes worthless if the storage container must be<br>
disassembled and rebuilt at a different location due to<br>
more important reasons. In addition, it is regulation that<br>
the total vehicle weight be known when it first leaves the<br>
operating area, where the storage container is located.<br>
Therefore, the invention is based on the task of<br>
creating a simpler option for detecting the fill state of<br>
the tank.<br>
For the storage container named above, the invention<br>
provides that relative to the discharge direction of the<br>
bulk material, on the outlet side of the cut-off device, a<br>
weighing module is provided, which is run through by the<br>
bulk material flow and which continuously detects the<br>
weight of the bulk material running through the cut-off<br>
device and which feeds weight-representative control<br>
signals to a controller, wherein the controller triggers<br>
the closing of the cut-off device when a predetermined<br>
limiting value is reached by the summed control signals.<br>
The invention has the advantage that the weight of the bulk<br>
material flowing out of the storage container can be<br>
measured directly, that is, not only by means of a separate<br>
vehicle scale. In addition, a weighing module is much less<br>
expensive and remains permanently on the storage container.<br>
Furthermore, typical storage containers can be easily<br>
retrofitted through simple measures by means of a weighing<br>
module with associated controller.<br><br>
For the invention, in the simplest case a weighing<br>
module can be used, which is described in document DE 102<br>
53 078 B3. The funnel of the weighing module preferably can<br>
be mounted directly on the outlet opening of the cut-off<br>
device. Especially for powdery bulk material, for example,<br>
cement, the positioning of a dedusting device between the<br>
cut-off device and weighing module is recommended. It is<br>
further advisable to change the housing of the known<br>
weighing module so that the bulk material flow leaves the<br>
weighing module in axial alignment with the inlet<br>
direction.<br>
There are bulk materials for which it is desirable<br>
that a second bulk material be added to them in the tank<br>
such that a predetermined ratio of the first material to<br>
the second material is set in the tank. For this purpose,<br>
an advantageous refinement of the invention provides that<br>
the weighing module is connected to the cut-off device via<br>
a short pipe connector, into which opens a feed from a<br>
dosing device containing the second material.<br>
The weighing module then definitely measures the total<br>
weight of the bulk material flow composed of the first and<br>
second materials. On the other hand, the current weight of<br>
the first bulk material flowing through the weighing module<br>
is essentially a constant determined by the first material.<br>
The controller connected to the weighing module stores both<br>
this constant and also the predetermined mixing ratio of<br>
the first to the second material. The controller includes a<br>
subtracting device, which subtracts the constant from the<br>
signal obtained from the weighing module and representing<br>
the current weight of the bulk material flow composed of<br>
the first and second materials and which compares the<br>
subtraction signal with the stored ratio value. The<br>
resulting signal of the comparison finally controls the<br>
discharge of the second material from the dosing device.<br>
This construction of the invention has the advantage that a<br><br>
second material can be mixed continuously in a<br>
predetermined ratio to the bulk material from the storage<br>
container directly after its cut-off device. A dosing<br>
device that is basically suited for this purpose is<br>
described in document DE 199 47 516 A1.<br>
For an especially advantageous construction of the<br>
invention, a weighing module is recommended, which is<br>
refined relative to the weighing module known from the<br>
named document in that the Coriolis force measurement<br>
device is arranged between a drive shaft driving an<br>
impeller wheel deflecting the bulk material flow and a<br>
bearing sleeve surrounding this drive shaft. The Coriolis<br>
effect can be detected with fine sensitivity so that the<br>
error percentage of the weight measurement is at less than<br>
1%. Furthermore, if the drive motor for the drive shaft is<br>
arranged preferably laterally next to the drive shaft or<br>
the weighing module housing, then the axial overall height<br>
of the weighing module can be reduced significantly, that<br>
is, to below approximately 100 cm. This embodiment allows<br>
not only the dwell time of the grains or powder particles<br>
of the bulk material flow in the weighing module to be<br>
shortened to less than approximately 100 ms, but also<br>
allows the construction of the weighing module on the<br>
storage container without increasing its height above the<br>
ground. Despite basic inaccuracies, the short dwell time<br>
allows a sufficiently precise control of the ratio of the<br>
mass flows.<br>
Additional advantageous constructions of the invention<br>
are given in the subordinate claims. An embodiment of the<br>
invention is described in detail below with reference to<br>
the enclosed drawing. Shown are:<br>
Figure 1, a schematic representation of a storage<br>
container equipped with the features of the invention with<br>
a truck standing in position;<br><br>

module that is advantageous for the invention; and<br>
Figure 3, a schematic representation of a controller<br>
with devices that are advantageous for realizing the<br>
invention.<br>
A sturdy foundation 50 in the form of supports made<br>
from steel or reinforced concrete supports a storage<br>
container 52, which has an essentially cylindrical main<br>
part 54 and a discharge part 5 6 running conically downward<br>
to an outlet opening 58. The pitch of the cone is naturally<br>
selected so that a granular or powdery bulk material 6 0<br>
contained in the storage container 52 automatically runs<br>
through the outlet opening 58 after this outlet opening is<br>
opened. In Figure 1, for explanation only a partial filling<br>
of the storage container 52 with bulk material 60 is shown.<br>
In practice, the storage container holds masses of bulk<br>
material of up to approximately 50 t or more.<br>
The foundation 50 leaves open a drive-through passage<br>
55 under the storage container 52 for a truck 57, which<br>
carries along, for example, as a semi-trailer truck, a tank<br>
62 that is to be filled with bulk material 60 from the<br>
storage container. Therefore, the foundation 5 0 must<br>
support the storage container 52 at such a height that a<br>
drive-through height H for the truck is maintained from the<br>
bottom edge of the storage container 52 to the ground 51.<br>
The discharge part 56 is equipped at the outlet<br>
opening 58 with a cut-off device 53 in the form of a<br>
controllable cut-off valve, which is connected to an<br>
expandable hose 61 connecting to a tank fill-in tip 63.<br>
According to the invention, the cut-off device 53 is<br>
coupled with a weighing module 65 of smaller axial overall<br>
height described below. The low overall height is such that<br>
the height H is practically not reduced by the weighing<br>
module 65.<br><br>
In Figure 2, a weighing module for detecting bulk<br>
material flows according to the Coriolis principle is shown<br>
schematically as a sectional figure. The weighing module 65<br>
essentially has a housing part 1, in which an impeller<br>
wheel 2 rotates, and a drive and measurement device<br>
arranged underneath, whose drive shaft 3 projects through a<br>
driving bearing sleeve 4 into the housing part 1. The<br>
bearing sleeve 4 is supported so that it can rotate in a<br>
stationary drive housing part 9, wherein a force<br>
measurement device 7 is arranged within the bearing sleeve<br>
4 between this sleeve and the drive shaft 3.<br>
During the measurement operation, the bulk material<br>
flow 10 is led as a mass flow through an inlet opening 6 in<br>
the axial direction to the impeller wheel 2, which is<br>
composed of a horizontal plate with radial guide plates and<br>
through which the bulk material 10 arriving in the axial<br>
direction is deflected radially outward. Through the<br>
impeller wheel 2 rotating at a constant rotational speed,<br>
the bulk material flow 10 is accelerated outward in the<br>
radial direction, wherein a braking moment, which is<br>
proportional to the mass flow 10, is generated based on the<br>
Coriolis force. For dust-tight measurement operation, the<br>
impeller wheel 2 is housed in the enclosed housing part 1,<br>
which:has in the lower region an outlet opening 24 through<br>
which the bulk material 10 is led into the fill-in tip 63<br>
of the truck.<br>
The impeller wheel 2 has a rotationally symmetric<br>
construction and a central drive shaft 3, which is arranged<br>
vertically and which has on its lower end a driving peg 14<br>
as driving means that is engaged with the force measurement<br>
device 7. The drive shaft 3 is surrounded coaxially by the<br>
bearing sleeve 4, which runs from the impeller wheel<br>
housing space 8 into the drive housing part 9 lying<br>
underneath. The bearing sleeve 4 has an essentially tubular<br>
construction and extends in axial length past the drive<br><br>
shaft 3 and is closed at its lower cross-sectional surface<br>
in the shape of a cylinder. The drive shaft 3 is supported<br>
in the bearing sleeve 4 so that it can rotate by means of<br>
two cylinder bearings 22 spaced apart from each other as<br>
radial bearings. At the lower horizontal end surface of the<br>
drive shaft 3, this shaft is supported in the axial<br>
direction on a central ball bearing 23, which contacts a<br>
crossbar 25 in the bearing sleeve 4 and therefore<br>
represents an essentially friction-free axial bearing of<br>
the drive shaft 3. Simultaneously, the arrangement of the<br>
bearings 22 and 23 guarantees that absolutely no axial or<br>
radial interference forces can act on the measurement body<br>
7a of the force measurement device 7. Because the drive<br>
shaft 3 can rotate only slightly by at most 5° relative to<br>
the bearing sleeve 4, the bearing friction of both the<br>
radial bearing 22 and the axial bearing 23 are to be<br>
disregarded. The radial bearings can also be constructed as<br>
air bearings, in order to improve the bearing friction. As<br>
a favorable alternative, a sliding bearing can be provided,<br>
which is sufficient especially for measurement devices with<br>
lower mass flows. As much as the space requirements permit,<br>
the drive shaft 3 can also be supported in the radial<br>
direction friction-free by means of a so-called cross-<br>
shaped spring element according to DE 103 30 947.0.<br>
At the impeller shaft housing space 8, the drive shaft<br>
3 is protected with a bearing seal 26 against penetrating<br>
bulk material. Because the drive shaft 3 rotates only<br>
slightly relative to the bearing sleeve 4, a continuously<br>
tight connection is provided. Preferably, tightly<br>
contacting rubber seals are used, which must be elastic in<br>
the rotational direction. For a simplified construction,<br>
the drive shaft 3 is mounted by an elastomer on the inner<br>
surface of the bearing sleeve 4 both for bulk material<br>
sealing and also for radial bearing, wherein elasticity in<br><br>
the rotational direction that is as friction-free as<br>
possible is all that must be guaranteed.<br>
The bearing sleeve 4 on its side is also supported by<br>
two cylinder bearings 21 in the radial and axial directions<br>
so that it can rotate in the stationary drive housing part<br>
9 and is sealed<br>
dust-tight by means of a sealing element 27 at the impeller<br>
wheel housing space 8. The sealing element 27 can also be<br>
integrated into the cylinder bearing 21 or can be<br>
constructed as an O-ring seal. Because neither the cylinder<br>
bearing 21 nor the sealing element 27 comes in contact with<br>
the measuring drive shaft 3, their friction values are not<br>
considered with respect to the measurement, so that these<br>
can be dimensioned advantageously such that they exhibit'<br>
mainly excellent stiffness in the case of the bearing or<br>
sealing effect in the case of the sealing element also<br>
relative to abrasive bulk material dust.<br>
In the lower drive housing part 9, a gear or pulley 19<br>
is provided as the bearing sleeve drive wheel for the<br>
common drive of the drive shaft 3 and the bearing sleeve 4.<br>
This drive wheel is arranged like a ring around the lower<br>
part of the bearing sleeve 4 and is connected rigidly to<br>
it. In the lower drive housing part 9, the drive motor 5 is<br>
fixed with a drive wheel 28, which lies on the drive shaft<br>
of this drive motor and which is connected to the bearing<br>
sleeve drive wheel 19 preferably via a geared belt 20,<br>
laterally next to the bearing sleeve drive wheel 19. This<br>
motor drive, however, can also be realized by a chain,<br>
ribbon, V-belt, or gear drive. This drive motor 5 arranged<br>
parallel to the bearing sleeve 4 advantageously allows a<br>
horizontal drive, through which a small overall height can<br>
be achieved. It is also conceivable, however, to arrange<br>
the,drive motor 5 directly under the bearing sleeve 4 and<br>
to connect to this sleeve via a fixed coupling.<br>
Alternatively, the lateral arrangement allows a housing 1,<br><br>
in which the inlet openings 6 and outlet openings 24 lie<br>
one above the other in the axial direction and thus can be<br>
integrated advantageously in a straight-line vertical feed<br>
tube part. As the drive motor 5, an electric motor is<br>
provided, which is constructed preferably as a simple<br>
asynchronous motor.<br>
In the lower part of the bearing sleeve 4, the force<br>
measurement device 7 is arranged and engages with the drive<br>
peg 14. The force measurement device 7 is constructed as a<br>
force sensor or as a weighing cell and transmits the drive<br>
force from the driving bearing sleeve 4 to the drive shaft<br>
3 and is therefore arranged directly between these parts.<br>
In the embodiment, a double cantilever beam sensor is<br>
provided as a force measurement device 7, which, however,<br>
could also be replaced by a rotationally symmetric weighing<br>
cell or a torque sensor. For this purpose, preferably<br>
rotationally symmetric torque sensors with spoke-like<br>
deformation bodies are used as the torque sensor, on which<br>
strain gauge strips are arranged, which can be attached<br>
coaxial to the drive shaft 3 or in its extension between<br>
this shaft and the bearing sleeve 4. Because the double<br>
cantilever beam 7 that is used is constructed as a strain<br>
gauge strip sensor, the braking moment proportional to the<br>
mass flow is detected by a slight tangential deflection of<br>
the double cantilever beam, wherein measurement paths on<br>
the weighing cell of 0.1 to 0.5 mm are typical. Therefore,<br>
the drive shaft 3 rotates essentially in sync with the<br>
sleeve rotational speed, wherein between both a maximum<br>
rotational angle of 5° is possible. Here, the force<br>
measurement device 7 is arranged preferably symmetric to-<br>
the common rotational axis of the drive shaft 3 and bearing<br>
sleeve, wherein the drive peg 14 is supported so that it<br>
pivots on the double cantilever beam.<br><br>
The drive shaft 3 could also be led out at the bottom<br>
from the bearing sleeve 4 through a bore hole, wherein the<br>
force measurement device 7 could then be housed in a<br>
separate sleeve part with enlarged inner diameter as<br>
compared to the hollow bodies connected to this device.<br>
Underneath the force measurement device 7 there is<br>
also a telemetry device 15, by means of which the<br>
measurement signals can be transmitted from the force<br>
sensor 7 to an evaluation device in a contactless way. For<br>
this purpose, the force sensor 7 is connected to an<br>
inductive transmitter device 16, through which the<br>
measurement signals are transmitted inductively to an<br>
inductive receiver device 17 in an opposing arrangement.<br>
Simultaneously, the inductive receiver device 17 is used<br>
for transmitting the supply voltage to the transmitter<br>
device 16, which is used for powering the strain gauge<br>
strip in the double cantilever beam. The received<br>
measurement signals can then be transmitted by means of a<br>
galvanic connection or a wireless transmission path to a<br>
not-shown evaluation device, which evaluates and displays<br>
and further processes the measurement signals. The<br>
transmission of the measurement signals is preferably<br>
performed by means of a carrier frequency alternating<br>
current or also by infrared transmission.<br>
The stationary housing part 9 has an essentially<br>
cylindrical construction and is installed in the stationary<br>
impeller wheel housing part 1, wherein the motor housing<br>
part is led laterally out of the impeller wheel housing<br>
part 1 and represents a part of the drive housing part 9.<br>
The impeller wheel housing part contains on its upper side<br>
the inlet opening 6, which preferably contains a connection<br>
flange that can be screwed to a feed tube. In the through-<br>
flow direction, the impeller wheel housing 1 has a conical<br>
construction and in this way spaced away from the drive<br>
housing part 9 so far that the flowing bulk material is fed<br><br>
vertically in the axial direction from the inlet opening 6<br>
to the outlet opening 24 lying underneath, which also can<br>
be connected to a feed tube. Therefore, advantageously,<br>
measurement device heights starting at 250 mm are possible,<br>
with which feed amounts of 20 t per hour can be measured.<br>
With overall heights starting at 900 mm, constructions up<br>
to 600 t per hour can be realized.<br>
The function of the measurement device is described in<br>
more detail with reference to the drawing. In the no-load<br>
operation, when no bulk material is led onto the impeller<br>
wheel 2, only a drive moment or a braking moment, which<br>
corresponds to the friction in the measurement section,<br>
must be applied by the bearing sleeve 4. Because no<br>
friction is generated in this part of the drive section by<br>
the bearing sleeve 4 rotating in sync with the drive shaft<br>
3, only the bearing friction caused by vibrations or small<br>
rotational speed deviations are applied by the bearing<br>
sleeve 4. The friction generated in this part is relatively<br>
small because the drive shaft 3 moves the bearing sleeve 4<br>
only very slightly due to such forces and little friction<br>
canalso appear through the cylinder bearing 22. A<br>
corresponding no-load torque is therefore generated only<br>
due to air turbulence on the impeller wheel 2, which is<br>
compensated by a buoyancy of the measurement device, so<br>
that a high zero-point consistency is produced by the<br>
nearly friction-free drive shaft bearing 22.<br>
Now if a bulk material flow 10 is discharged in the<br>
axial direction onto the impeller wheel 2, the deflection<br>
produces a radial acceleration of the bulk material flow<br>
10, which generates an additional braking moment, which is<br>
directly proportional to the mass flow due to a Coriolis<br>
force on the drive shaft 3. Therefore, the force<br>
measurement device 7 engaged with the drive shaft 3 is<br>
deflected tangentially a maximum of 0.1 to 0.5 mm and this<br>
braking moment is transmitted from the drive shaft 3 to the<br><br>
double cantilever beam sensor 7. The force detected by the<br>
double cantilever beam sensor 7 thus represents a value for<br>
the mass or bulk material flow 10 running via the impeller<br>
wheel 2. By means of the known geometrical dimensions of<br>
the impeller wheel 2 and also the lever arm lengths on the<br>
double cantilever beam sensor 7, with the help of a not-<br>
shown evaluation device, the feed strength or feed amount<br>
of the mass flow running via the impeller wheel 2 can be<br>
determined and displayed.<br>
Theoretically, for a constant drive rotational speed<br>
of the impeller wheel 2, the required drive torque between<br>
the impeller wheel 2 and its drive is exactly proportional<br>
to the mass flow rate. This is also influenced in practice<br>
by additional braking moments produced due to friction<br>
forces in the measurement section. This problem is solved<br>
by the inventive measure that all of the friction forces<br>
are completely eliminated in the measurement section for<br>
the drive shaft support at the transition to the impeller<br>
wheel housing space 8. This is achieved in that directly<br>
between the drive shaft 3 and the bearing sleeve 4 there is<br>
the force measurement device 7, by means of which nearly no<br>
relative movement is produced between the drive shaft 3 and<br>
the bearing sleeve 4, so that the drive shaft 3 is<br>
supported friction-free along its entire length up to the<br>
force measurement device 7. This also does not concern, in<br>
particular, the type of rotating radial bearing 22 between<br>
the drive shaft 3 and the bearing sleeve 4, so that simple<br>
bearings can also be provided. In contrast, the invention<br>
displaces the friction forces to the region between the<br>
outer jacket of the bearing sleeve 4 and the stationary<br>
drive housing part 9. Therefore, in principle the drive<br>
shaft 3 is decoupled from friction forces up to the<br>
impeller wheel housing space 8 because the friction-loaded<br>
axial and radial bearings 21 of the sleeve 4 are not<br>
arranged in the measurement section up to the force<br><br>
measurement device 7. Therefore, it is almost excluded that<br>
friction forces at the bearing seal 26 and bulk material<br>
dust possibly occurring there can influence the measurement<br>
accuracy. Therefore, temperature fluctuations in the bulk<br>
material also occurring in this region are not considered,<br>
in principle, for the measurement accuracy, because in this<br>
way the bearing friction between the bearing sleeve 4 and<br>
the drive housing part 9 definitely does fluctuate, but<br>
this does not affect the detectable drive moment that acts<br>
on the double cantilever beam sensor 7 in the measurement<br>
section. Therefore, friction-loaded sealing elements 27,<br>
which guarantee a continuous seal for bulk materials with<br>
very abrasive dust portions, can also be provided<br>
advantageously at the bearing 21 between the bearing sleeve<br>
4 and the drive housing part 9.<br>
In particular, through the friction-free drive shaft<br>
bearing according to the invention, which simultaneously<br>
guarantees, through its arrangement, that absolutely no<br>
axial or radial interference forces act on the measurement<br>
bodies, the measurement accuracy for small mass flows 10<br>
also improves because the relatively high impeller .wheel<br>
rotational speeds that are then necessary also tend for<br>
small bulk material deviations and non-uniform impeller<br>
wheel loading toward relatively strong unbalanced masses,<br>
which cannot act here in the measurement section. In<br>
addition, such a friction-free bearing of the measurement<br>
section allows a relatively small diameter of the bearing<br>
sleeve drive wheel 19 in comparison with the impeller wheel<br>
diameter, through which a higher measurement signal<br>
sensitivity is to be achieved because braking moment<br>
deviations caused by friction in the measurement section<br>
are minimized. Therefore, a high zero-point consistency is<br>
guaranteed also for small bulk material flows 10.<br>
The controller 70 has a programmable ROM 80, whose<br>
section 82 stores a total weight of bulk material to be<br><br>
stored by the tank 62. At the input 72, the controller 70<br>
receives the appropriate current measurement signals from<br>
the weighing module 65, which are summed in a summing<br>
device 74 over the entire filling process. The resulting<br>
sum signal is fed via line 73 to a comparison device 76 and<br>
is compared in this with the total weight signal taken from<br>
the section 82. The comparison result signal is fed or<br>
transmitted as a control signal via the output line 75 of<br>
the comparison device 76 to the cut-off device 53, if the<br>
cut-off device 53 has a receiver device for the control<br>
signal.<br>
If a second pourable material 40 is to be added to the<br>
bulk material 60, which is composed of a first material,<br>
from a dosing device 42 during the filling process, the<br>
dosing device 42 is connected via a tube piece 44 to a<br>
short port 46, which is inserted between the cut-off device<br>
53 and the inlet funnel of the weighing module 65.<br>
Furthermore, the dosing device has a controllable discharge<br>
valve 48.<br>
Typically, or also according to official regulations,<br>
the mixing ratio of the first material to the second<br>
material is a fixed parameter for the filling process. This<br>
parameter is stored as a ratio signal in a section 84 of<br>
the memory 80 in the controller 70. In this case, the<br>
weighing module 65 measures the current weight of the<br>
flowing bulk material flow, which is composed of the first<br>
and the second materials. Therefore, the current weight<br>
signal is fed from the weighing module 65 by the input 72<br>
of a subtraction device 90 into the controller 70, in which<br>
the constant taken from a section 86 of the memory 8 0 is<br>
subtracted from the weight signal. The material-dependent<br>
constant is determined empirically from the weight signal<br>
of the bulk material flow, which contains only the first<br>
material. The output signal from the subtraction device 90<br>
is fed together with the comparison signal taken from the<br><br>
section 84 to a comparison device 92, whose resulting<br>
output signal is fed or transmitted as a control signal via<br>
line 91 to the control input of the discharge valve 4 8 of<br>
the dosing device 42, if the dosing device has available a<br>
receiver device. In this way, the maintenance of the mixing<br>
ratio can be guaranteed also for deviating bulk material<br>
flow from the storage container 52.<br><br>

ABSTRACT<br><br><br>
Title: Storage container for granular or powdery bulk<br>
material<br>
The invention relates to a storage container (52) for<br>
granular or powdery bulk material (60). Said container (52)<br>
comprises a lower, generally conical discharge element (56)<br>
which is provided with a discharge opening (58) for the<br>
bulk material, a controlled cut-off device (53) being<br>
provided on the discharge opening (58). In order to allow<br>
the discharge quantity of the bulk material to be detected<br>
as simply as possible, a weighing module (65) is provided<br>
at a discharge end of the cut-off device (53) in relation<br>
to the direction of discharge of the bulk material, the<br>
flow of bulk material flowing through the weighing<br>
module(65). The weighing module continuously detects the<br>
weight of the bulk material discharged through the cut-off<br>
device (53) and transmits control signals representing the<br>
weight to a control (70). The control initiates closure of<br>
the cut-off device (53) once the added up control signals<br>
exceed a defined limit.</td>
