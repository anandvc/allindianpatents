TORQUE CONVERTER CLUTCH SLIP CONTROL<br>
FIELD<br>
[0001] The present disclosure relates to a powertrain having a<br>
transmission driven by an internal combustion engine through a torque converter<br>
having a torque converter clutch (TCC), and more particularly to TCC slip control<br>
during an electronic clutch control (ECC) mode transition.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0002] The statements in this section merely provide background<br>
information related to the present disclosure and may not constitute prior art.<br>
[0003] Vehicle powertrains typically include a prime mover, such as an<br>
internal combustion engine, a transmission and a coupling device that transfers<br>
drive torque from the prime mover to the transmission. The transmission<br>
multiplies the drive torque by an applied gear ratio to drive the vehicle's<br>
drivetrain. Exemplary transmissions include an automatic transmission having<br>
fixed gear ratios and a continuously variable transmission (CVT) having infinitely<br>
variable gear ratios.<br>
[0004] The coupling device often includes a torque converter that<br>
provides a fluid coupling between an output shaft of the prime mover and an<br>
input shaft of the transmission. As the output shaft accelerates, the input shaft is<br>
induced to accelerate through the fluid coupling. Once the input shaft speed is<br>
sufficiently near to the output shaft speed, a torque converter clutch (TCC) is<br>
engaged to provide a direct drive between the output shaft and the input shaft.<br>
1<br><br>
General Motors No. GP-308235-GMS-CD<br>
Attorney Docket No. 8540P-000424<br>
[0005] In some instances, an electronic dutch control (ECC) mode<br>
switches from Off to On, wherein engagement of the TCC is regulated. More<br>
specifically, clutch slip is regulated until the clutch is fully engaged or locked-up.<br>
Traditional control strategies implement a plurality of look-up tables, which are<br>
time-consuming and costly to regulate. Furthermore, traditional control strategies<br>
are not always transparent to the vehicle occupants, decreasing the drivability or<br>
drive feel.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0006] Accordingly, the present invention provides a method and<br>
system for regulating engagement of a torque converter clutch (TCC) in a vehicle<br>
incorporating a transmission that is driven by an engine through a torque<br>
converter. The method includes determining a slip profile based on vehicle<br>
operating parameters, calculating an actual TCC slip, calculating a TCC ramp<br>
pressure based on the slip profile and the actual TCC slip and regulating a TCC<br>
engagement pressure based on the TCC ramp pressure.<br>
[0007] In another feature, the method further includes determining the<br>
TCC engagement pressure based on a base pressure and the TCC ramp<br>
pressure.<br>
[0008] In another feature, the TCC ramp pressure is determined based<br>
on a TCC delta ramp pressure.<br>
[0009] In still other features, the TCC ramp pressure is determined<br>
based on a slip delta correction term and a slip error correction term.   The slip<br>
2<br><br>
Genera! Motors No. GP-308235-GMS-CD<br>
Attorney Docket No. 8540P-000424<br>
delta correction term is determined based on a vehicle operating parameter, a<br>
TCC slip target and a TCC slip reference. The TCC slip reference is a fixed<br>
value. The slip error correction term is determined based on a vehicle operating<br>
parameter and the actual TCC slip.<br>
[0010] In yet another feature, the actual TCC slip is determined as a<br>
difference between an engine speed and a turbine speed of the torque converter.<br>
[0011] The TCC slip control of the present invention generates a<br>
unique TCC slip profile as opposed to a fixed target. As a result, slip regulation<br>
of the TCC is more rapidly achieved and directly corresponds to the driving<br>
conditions. More specifically, the TCC slip profile improves vehicle drivability or<br>
feel in accordance with a transmission gear request, an engine torque and<br>
vehicle speed, and the transition of the ECC mode from Off to On is not<br>
noticeable by the vehicle occupants.<br>
[0012] Further areas of applicability will become apparent from the<br>
description provided herein. It should be understood that the description and<br>
specific examples are intended for purposes of illustration only and are not<br>
intended to limit the scope of the present disclosure.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0019] The following description of the preferred embodiment is merely<br>
exemplary in nature and is in no way intended to limit the invention, its<br>
application, or uses. For purposes of clarity, the same reference numbers will be<br>
used in the drawings to identify similar elements. As used herein, the term<br>
module refers to an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), an electronic<br>
circuit, a processor (shared, dedicated, or group) and memory that execute one<br>
or more software or firmware programs, a combinational logic circuit, or other<br>
suitable components that provide the described functionality.<br>
[0020] Referring now to Figure 1, an exemplary powertrain 10 is<br>
illustrated and includes an engine 12 that drives a transmission 14 through a<br>
4<br><br>
General Motors No. GP-308235-GMS-CD<br>
Attorney Docket No. 8540P-000424<br>
coupling device 16. More specifically, air is drawn into an intake manifold 18 of<br>
the engine 12 through a throttle 20. The air is mixed with fuel and the air/fuel<br>
mixture is combusted within cylinders 22 to reciprocally drive pistons (not shown)<br>
within the cylinders 22. The pistons rotatably drive a crankshaft 24 (see Figure<br>
2) to provide drive torque. Exhaust generated by the combustion process is<br>
exhausted from the engine through an exhaust manifold 26. Although 4 cylinders<br>
are illustrated, it is appreciated that the present invention can be implemented in<br>
vehicles having any number of cylinders.<br>
[0021] The drive torque drives is transferred through the torque<br>
converter 16 to drive the transmission 14. The transmission 14 multiplies the<br>
drive torque by a desired gear ratio to provide a modified drive torque. The<br>
modified drive torque is transferred to a vehicle driveline (not shown) by a<br>
transmission output shaft 28. The transmission 14 can include one of a manual<br>
transmission, an automatic transmission, an automated manual transmission and<br>
a continuously variable transmission (CVT). An automatic transmission includes<br>
a plurality of pre-defined, fixed gear ratios. A common CVT includes a belt and<br>
adjustable pulley system that enables an infinite variability between gear ratios<br>
without discrete steps or shifts.<br>
[0022] A control module 30 regulates operation of the powertrain based<br>
on vehicle operating parameters. More specifically, the control module 30<br>
regulates an effective throttle area (AEFF) via a throttle actuator 32. A throttle<br>
position sensor 34 generates a throttle position signal (TPS) based on the<br>
angular position  of the throttle 20.    The control  module 30 determines a<br>
5<br><br>
General Motors No. GP-308235-GMS-CD<br>
Attorney Docket No, 8540P-000424<br>
requested engine torque (TREQ) and adjusts the throttle position and other engine<br>
operating parameters to achieve TREQ. The other engine operating parameters<br>
include, but are not limited to, a fueling rate, spark timing, a camshaft phase<br>
and/or an intake/exhaust valve lift or timing.<br>
[0023] The control module 30 also regulates operation of the<br>
transmission 14 based on vehicle operating parameters. More specifically, a<br>
crankshaft position sensor 36 generates a crankshaft position signal, which is<br>
used to determine an actual engine speed (RPMENG). A transmission output<br>
shaft speed (TOSS) sensor 38 generates a TOSS signal, which is used to<br>
determine a vehicle speed (VVEH), and a transmission input shaft speed (TISS)<br>
sensor 39 generates a TISS signal. The control module 30 adjusts a gear ratio<br>
of the transmission 14 based on the throttle position (i.e., TPS) and VVEH. In an<br>
automatic transmission, the gear is shifted accordingly, and in a CVT, the pulley<br>
ratio is adjusted accordingly.<br>
[0024] Referring now to Figure 2, the coupling device 16 is illustrated<br>
as a torque converter that provides a fluid coupling between the engine 12 and<br>
the transmission 14. The torque converter 16 includes a housing 50 that is fixed<br>
for rotation with the crankshaft 24 via a flywheel 52. An impeller 54 is fixed for<br>
rotation with the housing 50 and a turbine 56 is fixed for rotation with a<br>
transmission input shaft 58. A stator 60 is also provided and is fixed from<br>
rotation. The interior of the torque converter 16 is filled with a viscous fluid.<br>
Rotation of the impeller 54 induces corresponding motion of the viscous fluid,<br>
which is directed towards the turbine 56 by the stator 60 to induce rotation of the<br>
6<br><br>
General Motors No. GP-308235-GMS-CD<br>
Attorney Docket No. 8540P-000424<br>
turbine 56. The torque converter 16 includes a torque converter clutch (TCC) 57,<br>
which is selectively engaged to provide a direct drive between the crankshaft 24<br>
and the input shaft 58.<br>
[0025] As the crankshaft 24 rotates at an idle speed (RPMIDLE), the<br>
impeller 54 is induced to rotate. RPM|DLE, however, is normally insufficient to<br>
overcome braking forces that inhibit the turbine 56 from rotating. As the braking<br>
forces are reduced and/or RPMENG increases, the impeller 54 drives the viscous<br>
fluid into the turbine 56 and the turbine 56 is induced to rotate. As a result, drive<br>
torque is transferred through the transmission 14 to propel the vehicle. Upon<br>
achieving a point where there is little or no RPM difference between the turbine<br>
56 and impeller 54, the TCC is engaged to provide a direct drive between the<br>
engine 12 and the transmission 14. Under this condition, the rotational speed of<br>
the turbine 56 (RPMTURB) is equal to RPMENG. Generally, RPMTURB is determined<br>
based on the TISS signal. The TCC slip (∆RPM) is determined as the difference<br>
between RPMENG and RPMTISS.<br>
[0026] The TCC slip control of the present invention sets a TCC slip<br>
profile when transitioning the ECC from an OFF mode to an ON mode, and<br>
performs a closed-loop slip control around the slip profile. In this manner, the<br>
TCC slip is more rapidly regulated depending on driving conditions, vehicle<br>
drivability is enhanced and traditional calibration tables, which are time<br>
consuming and costly to develop per vehicle platform, can be forgone.<br>
[0027] The TCC slip control of the present disclosure is implemented<br>
under conditions where the transmission 14 is in a static condition (i.e., is not<br>
7<br><br>
General Motors No. GP-308235-GMS-CD<br>
Attorney Docket No. 8540P-000424<br>
shifting), and an initial ARPM error (∆RPMERROR) is inside of a range defined<br>
between a minimum value (∆RPMERRORMIN) and a maximum value<br>
(ARPMERRORMAX). If these initialization conditions are true, a target ∆RPM<br>
(ARPMTARGET) profile is determined based on a turbine speed gradient that is<br>
calculated based on the TISS signal and the TCC slip. The TCC slip control<br>
performs a closed-loop control about the ARPMTARGET profile, such that ARPM<br>
closely follows the profile.<br>
[0028] A TCC engagement pressure (PTCC) is calculated as the sum of<br>
a base TCC pressure (PTCCBASE) and a TCC ramp pressure (PTCCRAMP). PTCCRAMP<br>
is determined as the product of a delta ramp pressure (∆PTCCRAMP) and a loop<br>
time (tLoop)- tLoop is the loop time (e.g., 25 ms) of the processor that performs<br>
the calculations described herein. ∆PTCCRAMP is determined as the sum of a slip<br>
delta correction term (ARPMCORR) and ARPMERROR correction term<br>
(ARPMERRORCORR). ARPMCORR is determined from a look-up table as a function<br>
of TENG and the difference between ∆RPMTARGET and a reference ∆RPM value<br>
(ARPMREF). ARPMREF is determined from a look-up table based on current<br>
transmission gear, TENG and RPMTURB. ARPMERRORCORR is determined the<br>
difference between ∆RPM (i.e., RPMENG - RPMTURB) and ARPMTARGET.<br>
[0029] Referring now to Figure 3, the hydraulic system, which actuates<br>
engagement of the TCC is regulated based on PTCC, calculated as described<br>
above, to achieve the desired TCC slip profile. Upon entering the ECC On<br>
mode, the TCC slip profile is determined based on the turbine speed gradient,<br>
calculated based on the TISS signal, and the TCC slip.   Accordingly, the TCC<br>
8<br><br>
General Motors No. GP-308235-GMS-CD<br>
Attorney Docket No. 8540P-000424<br>
slip profile is chosen from a plurality of possible TCC slip profiles. The TCC slip<br>
control of the present disclosure regulates engagement of the TCC such that<br>
ARPM shadows the TCC slip profile. Depending on a calibration value, the slip<br>
profile can be linear (i.e., constant slip reduction over time) or can be non-linear<br>
(i.e., cumulative effect).<br>
[0030] Referring now to Figure 4, exemplary steps that are executed by<br>
the TCC slip control will be described in detail. In step 400, control determines<br>
whether ∆RPM is inside of a range defined between a minimum value<br>
(∆RPMERRORMIN) and a maximum value (ARPMERRORMAX). If these initialization<br>
conditions are true control continues in step 402. In step 402, control determines<br>
PTCCRAMP per a traditional strategy and continues in step 412. If ∆RPM is outside<br>
of a range defined between a minimum value (ARPMERRORMIN) and a maximum<br>
value (ARPMERRORMAX), control determines whether the current transmission<br>
state is transient (e.g., a shift is occurring) in step 406. If the transmission state<br>
is transient, control continues in step 402. If the transmission state is not<br>
transient, control continues in step 408.<br>
[0031] In step 408, control determines ∆RPMERROR. In step 410,<br>
control determines whether ∆RPM is within the range defined between ∆RPMMIN<br>
and ∆RPMMAX. If ARPM is within the range, control continues in step 412. If<br>
∆RPM is not within the range, control continues in step 414. In step 414, control<br>
determines PTCCRAMP based on ∆PTCCRAMP and control continues in step 404. In<br>
step 404, control determines PTCC based on PTCCBASE and PTCCRAMP in step 404,<br>
and control ends.<br>
9<br><br>
General Motors No. GP-308235-GMS-CD<br>
Attorney Docket No. 8540P-000424<br>
[0032] In step 412, control determines whether PTCCRAMP is less than a<br>
calibrated value (PTCCCAL). If PTCCRAMP is less than PTCCCAL, control continues in<br>
step 404. If PTCCRAMP is not less than PTCCCAL, control sets PTCCRAMP equal to<br>
PTCCCAL in step 416, and control continues in step 404.<br>
[0033] Referring now to Figure 5, exemplary modules that execute the<br>
TCC slip control will be described in detail. The exemplary modules include, but<br>
are not limited to, a ∆RPM module 500, a TCC slip profile determining module<br>
502, a PTCCRAMP determining module 504 and a TCC regulating module 506. The<br>
∆RPM module 500 determines ∆RPM based on RPMTISS (i.e., RPMTURB) and<br>
RPMENG . The TCC slip profile determining module 502 determines the TCC slip<br>
profile based on RPMTISS and TENG. The PTCCRAMP determining module 504<br>
determines PTCCRAMP based on ∆RPM and the TCC slip profile. The TCC<br>
regulating module 506 determines PTCC based on PTCCRAMP and generates<br>
corresponding control signals to regulate engagement of the TCC.<br>
[0034] Those skilled in the art can now appreciate from the foregoing<br>
description that the broad teachings of the present invention can be implemented<br>
in a variety of forms. Therefore, while this invention has been described in<br>
connection with particular examples thereof, the true scope of the invention<br>
should not be so limited since other modifications will become apparent to the<br>
