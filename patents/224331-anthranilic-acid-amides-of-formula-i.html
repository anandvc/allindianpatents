ANTHRANILAMIDES. PROCESS FOR THEIR PREPARATION, THEIR USE AS ANTIARRHYTHMICS, AND PHARMACEUTICAL PREPARATIONS THEREOF<br>
The invention relates to compounds of the formula  <br><br>
The compounds of the invention of the formula I have not previously been disclosed. They act on the so-called Kv1.5 potassium channel and Inhibit a potassium current, which is referred to as ultra-rapidly activating delayed rectifier in the atrium of the human heart. The compounds are therefore very particularly suitable as novel antiarrhythmic active ingredients, in particular for the treatment and prophylaxis of atrial arrhythmias, e.g. atrial fibrillation (AF) or atrial flutter.<br>
Atrial fibrillation (AF) and atrial flutter are the commonest persistent cardiac arrhythmias. The occurrence increases with increasing age and frequently leads to fatal sequelae such as, for example, stroke. It affects about 1 million Americans each year and leads to more than 80 000 strokes annually in the USA. The class I and til antiarrhythmics in use at present reduce the rate of recurrence of AF but are used to only a limited extent because of their potential proarrhythmic side effects. There is thus a great medical need to develop better medicaments tor the treatment of atrial arrhythmias (S. Nattel, Am. Heart J. 130,1995, 1094 -1106; "Newer developments in the management of atrial fibrillation").<br><br><br>
It has been shown that most supraventricular arrhythmias are subject to so-called reentry waves. Such reentries occur when the cardiac tissue has a slow conductivity and, at the same time, very short refractory periods. Increasing the myocardial refractory period by prolonging the action potential is an acknowledged mechanism for terminating arrhythmias and preventing development thereof {T. J. Colatsky et al., Drug Dev. Res. 19, 1990,129 -140; "Potassium channels as targets for antiarrhythmic drug action"). The length of the action potential is essentially determined by the extent<br>
of repolarizing K+ currents which flow out of the cells through various K+ channels. Particularly great importance is ascribed in this connection to a so-called delayed rectifier 11 which consists of 3 different components: IKf, IKs and IKur-<br>
Most of the known class III antiarrhythmics (e.g. dofetilide, E4031 and d-sotalol) block predominantly or exclusively the rapidly activating potassium channel IK1, which can<br>
be detected both in cells o1 the human ventricle and in the atrium. However, it has emerged that these compounds have an increased proarrhythmic risk at heart rates which are low or normal, and arrhythmias referred to as torsades de pointes have been observed in particular (D. M. Roden, Am. J. Cardiol. 72, 1993, 44B - 49B; "Current status of class III antiarrhythmic drug therapy"). Besides this high risk, which is fatal in some cases, when the rate is low, the activity of the iKr blockers has been found to decline under the conditions of tachycardia, which Is just where the effect is required ("negative use-dependence").<br>
Whereas some of the disadvantages can possibly be overcome by blockers of the slowly activating component (IKs). their efficacy has not yet been proven because no clinical investigations with IKg channel blockers are known.<br>
The "particularly rapidly" activating and very slowly inactivating component of the delayed rectifier IKjr (=ultra-rapidly activating delayed rectifier), which corresponds to<br>
the Kv1.5 channel, plays a particularly large part in the repolarization time in the human atrium. Inhibition of the IKur potassium outward current thus represents by comparison with inhibition of IKr or IKs a particularly effective method for prolonging<br><br>
the atrial action potential and thus for terminating or preventing atrial arrhythmias. Mathematical models of the human action potential suggest that the beneficial effect of blockade of the IKji- ought to be particularly pronounced precisely under the pathological conditions of chronic atrial fibrillation (M. Courtemanche, R. J. Ramirez, S. Nattel, Cardiovascular Research 1999, 42, 477-489: "Ionic targets for drug therapy and atrial fibrillation-induced electrical remodeling: insights from a mathematical model").<br>
In contrast to IKf and IKQ, which also occur in the human ventricle, although IKu1 plays a significant part in the human atrium it does not in the ventricle. For this reason, when the IKur current is inhibited, in contrast to blockade of IKf or IKs, the risk of a<br>
proarrhythmic effect on the ventricle is precluded from the outset. (Z. Wang et at., Circ. Res. 73, 1993, 1061 -1076; "Sustained Depolarisation-lnduced Outward Current in Human Atrial Myocytes"; G.-R. Li et al., Circ. Res. 78, 1996, 689 - 696: "Evidence for<br>
Two Components of Delayed Rectifier K+-Current in Human Ventricular Myocytes"; G. J. Amos et al., J. Physiol. 491,1996, 31 - 50: "Differences between outward currents of human atrial and subepicardial ventricular myocytes").<br>
Antiarrhythmics which act via selective blockade of the IKur current or Kvl .6 channel<br>
have not to date been available on the market. Although numerous active pharmaceutical ingredients (e.g. tedisamil, bupivacaine or sertindole) have tseen described to have a blocking effect on the Kv1.5 channel, in each of these cases the Kvl .5 blockade is only a side effect in addition to other principal effects of the substances.<br>
WO 98 04 521 and WO 99 37 607 claim aminoindanes and aminotetrahydro-naphthalenes as potassium channel blockers which block the Kvl .5 channel. Likewise claimed as Kvl .5 blockers are structurally related aminochromans in WO 00 12 077. Thiazolidinones which likewise block the potassium channel are claimed in the application WO 99 62 891. The use of various pyridazinones and phosphine oxides as antiarrhythmics which are said to act via IKj1 blockade is claimed in the applications WO 98 18 475 and WO 98 18 476. However, the same compounds were originally<br><br>
also described as immunosuppressants (WO 96 25 936). All the compounds described in the abovementioned applications have structures which are completely different from the compounds of the invention in this application. We are not aware of any clinical data for any of the compounds claimed In the abovementioned applications. Since experience shows that only a small fraction of active Ingredients from preclinical research successfully overcomes all the clinical hurdles leading to a medicament, there is still a need for promising substances.<br>
It has now been found, surprisingly, that the anthranilamides of the invention of the formula I are potent blockers of the human Kvl .5 channel. They can therefore be used as novel antiarrhythmics with a particularly advantageous safety profile. The compounds are particularly suitable for treating supraventricular arrhythmias, e.g. atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter.<br>
The compounds can be employed for terminating existing atrial fibrillation or flutter to return to sinus rhythm (cardioversion). In addition, the substances reduce the susceptibility to recurrence of fibrillation events {retention of sinus rhythm, prophylaxis).<br>
The compounds of the invention have not previously been disclosed. Some structurally related compounds are described in the publications discussed hereinafter.<br>
Thus, for example, compounds A and B were mentioned in FEBS Letters 421 (1981) 217-220 as serine protease Inhibitors. Compounds C and D, and similar derivatives are described in J. Med. Chem. 11 (1968) 777-787 as precursors for synthesizing tetrahydroisoquino[2,1 -d][1,4] benzodiazepines.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

European patent application EP-A 0 686 625 describes anthranllic acid derivatives and their use as cGMP phosphodiesterase inhibitors. Most of the 144 compounds described by way of example therein differ from the compounds of the formula I inter alia through replacement of the sulfonyl group by a carbonyl group. Only 3 of the examples likewise contain a sulfonylamino substitution, of which compound E (example 135 in EP-A 0 686 625) comes closest in structure to the compounds in this application. Possible indications mentioned for the claimed compounds are ischemic heart disease, angina pectoris, hypertension, pulmonary hypertension, heart failure and asthma. This by no means makes It obvious that these or similar compounds can be used as antiarrhythmics.<br><br><br>

If the compounds of the formula I contain one or more acidic or basic groups or one or more basic heterocycles, the invention also includes the corresponding physiologically or toxicologically acceptable salts, in particular the pharmaceutically utilizable salts. Thus, the compounds of the formula I which have acidic groups, e.g. one or more COOH groups, can be used for example as alkali metal salts, preferably sodium or potassium salts, or as alkaline earth metal salts, e.g. calcium or magnesium salts, or as ammonium salts, e.g. as salts with ammonia or organic amines or amino acids. With compounds of the formula I in which R2 is hydrogen it is possible, for example, for the sulfonamide function to be deprotonated to form a sodium salt. Compounds of the formula I which have one or more basic, i.e. protonatable, groups or contain one or more basic heterocyclic rings can also be used in the form of their physiologically tolerated acid addition salts with inorganic or organic acids, for example as hydrochlorides, phosphates, sulfates, methanesulfonates, acetates, lactates, maleates, fumarates, malates, gluconates etc. If the compounds of the formula I contain t&gt;oth acidic and basic groups in the molecule, the invention includes not onJy the salt forms described but also inner salts, called betaines. Salts can be obtained from the compounds of the formula I by conventional processes, for example by combining with an acid or base in a solvent or dispersant or else by anion exchange from other salts.<br><br>
The compounds of the formula I may when appropriately substituted exist in stereoisomeric forms. If the compounds of the formula I contain one or more centers of asymmetry, these may have, independently of one another, the S configuration or the R configuration. The invention includes all possible stereoisomers, e.g. enantiomers or diastereomers, and mixtures of two or more stereoisomeric forms, e.g. enantiomers and/or diastereomers, in any ratios. The invention thus includes, for example, enantiomers in enantiopure form, both as levorotatory and as dextrorotatory antipodes, and in the form of mixtures of the two enantiomers in various ratios or in the form of racemates. Individual stereoisomers can be prepared if required by fractionating a mixture by conventional methods or, for example, by stereoselective synthesis. If mobile hydrogen atoms are present, all tautomeric forms of the compounds of the formula I are also encompassed by the present invention.<br>
The compounds of the formula I can be prepared by various chemical processes, some examples of which are outlined as scheme 1 or 2 below. The radicals R(1) to R(7) used herein are In each case defined as indicated above.<br>
As shown in scheme 1, compounds of the invention can be prepared, for example, by initially reacting an amino carboxylic acid of the formula II in a solvent such as water, pyridine or an ether in the presence of a base with a sulfonyl chloride of the formula R(3)-S02-CI or a sulfonic anhydride. Suitable as base are inorganic bases such as, for example, sodium carbonate or potassium hydroxide or organic bases such as, for example, pyridine or triethylamine.<br>
The resulting sulfonylamino carboxylic acid of the formula III can then be activated, for example by reaction with a chlorinating agent such as, for example, phosphorus pentachloride, phosphorus oxychloride or thionyl chloride, in an inert solvent to give an acid chloride and then be reacted with an amine of the formula H-R1 to give the title compounds of the formula I. However, activation of the carboxyl group in the compound of the formula III can also take place in a different way, for example by one of the numerous methods familiar to the skilled worker and used in peptide chemistry<br><br>
/<br>
for forming amide bonds, for example by conversion into a mixed anhydride or an activated ester or with use of a carbodiimide such as dicyclohexylcarbodiimde.<br>
The reaction of the activated sulfonylamino carboxylic acid with an amine of the formula H-R1 is advantageously carried out in an inert solvent such as, for example, pyridine, tetrahydrofuran or toluene without addition or with addition of an inert base, for example a tertiary amine or pyridine.<br><br>

Alternatively, as shown in scheme 2, it is also possible initially to react the anhydrides of the formula IV with an amine of the formula H-R1 to give an o-aminobenzamide of the formula VII, from which a compound of the formula I is then obtained by reaction with a sulfonyl chloride of the formula R(3)S02CI. Another possibility for preparing<br>
intermediates of the formula VII in which R(2} is hydrogen comprises the amidation of an o-nitrobenzoic acid of the formula V with an amine of the formula HNR(1)R(2), followed by reduction of the nitro group to the amine.<br><br>

The compounds of the invention of the formula I and their physiologically tolerated salts can thus be used on animals, preferably on mammals and, in particular, on humans as pharmaceuticals on their own or in mixtures with one another or in the form of pharmaceutical preparations. The present invention also relates to compounds of the formula I and their physiologically tolerated salts for use as phamnaceuticals, to their use in the therapy and prophylaxis of the pathological states mentioned and to<br>
their use for producing medicaments therefor and medicaments with K+ channel-blocking effect. The present invention further relates to pharmaceutical preparations which comprise as active ingredient an effective dose of at least one compound of the formula I and/or a physiologically tolerated salt thereof in addition to conventional<br><br>
pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and excipients. The pharmaceutical preparations normally contain from 0.1 to 90% by weight of the compounds of the formula I and/or their physiologically tolerated salts. The pharmaceutical preparations can be produced in a manner known per se. For this purpose, the compounds of the formula I and/or their physiologically tolerated salts are converted together with one or more solid or liquid pharmaceutical carriers and/or excipients and, if desired, In combination with other active pharmaceutical ingredients into a suitable administration form or dosage form which can then be used as pharmaceutical in human medicine or veterinary medicine.<br>
Pharmaceuticals which comprise compounds of the invention of the formula I and/or their physiologically tolerated salts can be administered orally, parenterally, e.g. intravenously, rectally, by inhalation or topically, the preferred administration depending on the individual case, e.g the particular manifestation of the disease to be treated.<br>
The excipients suitable for the desired pharmaceutical formulation are familiar to the skilled worker on the basis of his expert knowledge. Besides solvents, gel formers, suppository bases, tablet excipients and other active ingredient carriers it is possible to use, for example, antioxidants, dispersants, emulsifiers, antifoams, flavor corrigents, preservatives, solubilizers, agents to achieve a depot effect, buffer substances or colorants.<br>
The compounds of the formula I can also be combined with other active pharmaceutical ingredients to achieve an advantageous therapeutic effect. Thus, in the treatment of cardiovascular disorders, combinations with substances acting on the cardiovascular system are possible and advantageous. Such combination partners advantageous for cardiovascular disorders are, for example, other antiarrhythmics, i.e. class I, class II or class III antiarrhythmics, such as, for example, IKs- or IKp channel blockers, e.g. dofetilide, or, in addition, hypotensive substances such as ACE inhibitors (for example enalapril, captopril, ramipril), angiotensin antagonists, K+ channel activators, and alpha- and beta-receptor blockers, as well as sympathomimetic and<br><br>
adrenergic compounds, and Na+/H+ exchange inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, phosphodiesterase inhibitors and other substances with a positive inotropic effect, such as, for example, digitalis glycosides, or diuretics.<br>
For a form for oral use, the active compounds are mixed with the additives suitable for this purpose, such as carriers, stabilizers or inert diluents, and converted by conventional methods into the suitable administration forms such as tablets, coated tablets, hard gelatin capsules, aqueous, alcoholic or oily solutions. Examples of inert carriers which can be used are gum arabic, magnesia, magnesium carbonate, potassium phosphate, lactose, glucose or starch, especially corn starch. Preparation is possible in this connection both as dry and as wet granules. Suitable as oily carriers or as solvents are, for example, vegetable or animal oils, such as sunflower oil or fish liver oil. Examples of suitable solvents for aqueous or alcoholic solutions are water, ethanol or sugar solutions or mixtures thereof. Further examples of excipients, also for other administration forms, are polyethylene glycols and polypropylene glycols.<br>
For subcutaneous or intravenous administration, the active compounds are converted into a solution, suspension or emulsion, if desired with the substar1ces customary for this purpose, such as solubilizers, emulsifiers or other excipients. The compounds of the formula I and their physiologically tolerated salts can also be lyophilized and the resulting lyophilizates be used for example to produce products for injection or infusion. Examples of suitable solvents are water, physiological saline or alcohols, e.g. ethanol, propanol, glycerol, as well as sugar solutions such as glucose or mannitol solutions, or else mixtures of the various solvents mentioned.<br>
Suitable as pharmaceutical formulation for administration In the form of aerosols or sprays are, for example, solutions, suspensions or emulsions of the active ingredients of the formula I or of their physiologically tolerated salts in a pharmaceutically acceptable solvent such as, in particular, ethanol or water, or a mixture of such solvents. The formulation can if required also contain other pharmaceutical excipients such as surfactants, emulsifiers and stabilizers, and a propeliant gas. Such a<br><br>
preparation normally contains the active ingredient in a concentration of about 0.1 to 10, in particular of about 0.3 to 3, percent by weight.<br>
The dosage of the active ingredient of the formula I to be administered or of the physiologically tolerated salt thereof depends on the individual case and should be adapted in a conventional way to the circumstances of the individual case for an optimal effect. Thus, of course, it depends on the frequency of administration and on the potency and duration of action of the compounds employed in each case for therapy or prophylaxis, but also on the nature and severity of the disease to be treated and on the sex, age, weight and individual response of the human or animal to be treated and on whether the therapy is acute or prophylactic. The daily dose of a compound of the formula I is normally, on administration to a patient weighing about 75 kg, from 0.001 mg/kg of bodyweight to 100 mg/kg of bodyweight, preferably 0.01 mg/kg of bodyweight to 20 mg/kg of bodyweight. The dose can be administered in the form of a single dose or else be divided into a plurality of, e.g. two, three or four single doses. Especially in the treatment of acute cases of cardiac arrhythmias, for example on an intensive care ward, parenteral administration by injection or Infusion, e.g. by a continuous intravenous infusion, may also be advantageous.<br><br>
