				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
FUSED INDANE COMPOUND<br>
Technical Field<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a pharmaceutical, particularly a fused indane<br>
compound which is useful as an NMDA receptor antagonist.<br>
Background Art<br>
[0002]<br>
Glutamic acid acts as a neurotransmitter in the central nervous system of<br>
mammals, and controls the activity of neurocytes or the release of neurotransmitters via a<br>
glutamate receptor existing in synapses.   At present, a glutamate receptor is classified into<br>
an ionotropic receptor and a metabotropic receptor from many pharmacological and<br>
physiological studies (Hollmann M. and Heinemann S., Annu. Rev. Neurosci., 17 (1994)<br>
31-108).   An NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartic acid) receptor is an ionotropic glutamate<br>
receptor specifically sensitive to the NMDA as an agonist (Moriyoshi K., Nature, 354<br>
(1991) 31-37; Meguro H., Nature, 357 (1992) 70-74); and has high Ca2+ ion permeability<br>
(lino M., J. Physiol., 424 (1990) 151-165).   The NMDA receptor is expressed with a<br>
specific pattern in the central nervous system (Ozawa S., Prog. Neurobiol., 54 (1998) 581-<br>
618).<br>
From many pharmacological and biological studies, it is believed that an NMDA<br>
receptor is involved in higher nerve activities such as memory, learning, and the like<br>
(Morris R. G., Nature, 319 (1986) 774-776; Tsien J. Z., Cell, 87 (1996) 1327-1338).   On<br>
the other hand, it is suggested that the acute or chronic enhancement or inhibition of the<br>
NMDA receptor activity relates to various nervous system diseases, for example, ischemic<br>
apoplexy, hemorrhagic brain disorder, traumatic brain disorder, neurodegenerative<br>
disorders (Alzheimer's disease, cerebrovascular dementia, Parkinson's disease,<br>
Huntington's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and the like), glaucoma, AIDS<br>
encephalopathy, dependence, schizophrenia, depression, mania, stress-related diseases,<br>
epilepsy, pain, and the like (Beal M. F., FASEB J., 6 (1992) 3338-3344; Heresco-Levy U.<br>
and Javitt D. C, Euro. Neuropsychopharmacol, 8 (1998) 141-152; Hewitt D. J., Clin. J.<br>
Pain, 16 (2000) S73-79).    Accordingly, it is thought that drugs capable of controlling the<br>
activity of an NMDA receptor would be extremely useful in clinical application.<br>
[0003]<br>
As drugs capable of controlling the activity of an NMDA receptor, a large number<br>
of non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonists are reported, but many of them have not<br>
been used in clinical application because of their side effects based on the NMDA<br>
receptor-antagonizing effect thereof, for example, mental aberrations such as<br>
hallucinations and confusion, giddiness and the like.   It has been tried to apply some of<br>
the conventional NMDA receptor antagonists, for example, ketamine and<br>
dextromethorphan, against pain or the like in clinical application (Fisher K., J. Pain<br>
Symptom Manage., 20 (2000) 358-373).   However, their safety margin in treatments is<br>
narrow, and their clinical use is limited (Eide P. K., Pain, 58 (1994) 347-354).   Also,<br>
memantine is known as a non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist that has<br>
comparatively few side effects (Parsons C. G., Neuropharmacol., 38 (1999) 735-767); and<br>
recently, it has been reported that it is effective for Alzheimer's disease (Reisberg B., N.<br>
Engl. J. Med., 348 (2003) 1333-1341).   However, the safety margin of memantine as a<br>
medicine is still not satisfactory, and development of an NMDA receptor antagonist having<br>
a broader safety margin is desired (Ditzler K., Arzneimittelforschung, 41 (1991) 773-780;<br>
Maier C, Pain, 103 (2003) 277-283; Riederer P., Lancet, 338 (1991) 1022-1023).    It is<br>
expected that creation of such an NMDA receptor antagonist superior in terms of a broader<br>
safety margin may bring about new clinical usefulness of the NMDA receptor antagonist.<br>
[0004]<br>
It is known that a cyclic amine derivative represented by the following formula has<br>
an NMDA receptor antagonistic action and is useful for treating and preventing<br>
Alzheimer's disease, cerebrovascular dementia, Parkinson's disease, ischemic apoplexy, or<br>
pain (Patent Document 1).   However, this document neither discloses nor suggests the<br>
fused indane compound according to the present invention.<br>
[0005]<br>
[Chem. 1]<br><br>
(For the symbols in the formula, refer to this document).<br>
[0006]<br>
Further, it is known that a compound represented by the following formula has<br>
anticancer activities (Patent Document 2).   However, there is neither disclosure nor<br>
suggestion on its NMDA receptor antagonistic action, nor its usefulness for treating<br>
Alzheimer's disease, cerebrovascular dementia, Parkinson's disease, ischemic apoplexy,<br>
pain, or the like according to the present invention.<br>
[0008]<br>
Furthermore, it is suggested that a compound represented by the following formula<br>
is a ligand for a dopamine D3 receptor and relates to the diseases regarding central nerves<br>
(Non-Patent Document 1).   However, this document neither discloses nor suggests the<br>
fused indane compound according to the present invention.<br>
[0009]<br>
[Chem. 3]<br>
Further, an indeno[l,2-b]pyridine compound in which a phenyl group is<br>
substituted at the 9b-position is known as a ligand for NK-1 and dopamine receptors (Non-<br>
Patent Document 2 and Non-Patent Document 3).   However, this document neither<br>
discloses nor suggests the fused indane compound according to the present invention.<br>
In addition, an indeno[l,2-b]pyridine compound in which a phenyl group is<br>
substituted at the 5-position is known (Non-Patent Document 4).   However, this<br>
document neither discloses nor suggests the fused indane compound according to the<br>
present invention.<br>
[0011]<br>
Also, it is suggested that a compound represented by the following formula has a<br>
catecholamine uptake inhibitory action and can be used as an anti-depressant or an anti-<br>
Parkinson's disease drug (Non-Patent Document 5).   However, this document neither<br>
discloses nor suggests the fused indane compound according to the present invention.<br>

(Production Processes)<br>
The compound according to the present invention and a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salt thereof can be prepared by applying various known synthetic methods,<br>
using the characteristics based on their basic skeletons or the kinds of the substituents.   At<br>
this time, depending on the types of the functional groups, it is in some cases effective<br>
from the viewpoint of the preparation techniques to substitute the functional group with an<br>
appropriate protecting group (a group which is capable of being easily converted into the<br>
functional group), during the steps from starting materials to intermediates.   Examples of<br>
the protecting group include the protective groups as described in "Protective Groups in<br>
Organic Synthesis (3rd edition, 1999)", edited by Greene and Wuts, and the like, which<br>
may be appropriately selected and used depending on the reaction conditions.   In these<br>
methods, a desired compound can be obtained by introducing the protecting group to carry<br>
out the reaction, and then, if desired, removing the protecting group.<br>
Furthermore, another compound according to the present invention can also be<br>
prepared by further carrying out a method well-known to a person skilled in the art, such as<br>
common N-alkylation, reduction, oxidation, hydrolysis, and the like for the compound<br>
according to the present invention.   For example, another compound according to the<br>
present invention can also be prepared by carrying out a reaction which can be employed<br>
for introduction of a group represented by -R3 other than -H onto nitrogen by a person<br>
skilled in the art, such as common N-alkylation reactions, reductive amination reactions,<br>
and the like, for the compound (lc) or (le) obtained in the first production process, the<br>
compound (2d) obtained in the second production process, the compound (3c) obtained in<br>
third production process, or the compound (4d) obtained in fourth production process.<br>
Further, the introduction of a group represented by -R3 other than -H onto nitrogen can be<br>
conducted at a step during preparation of intermediates, or specifically, for example, the<br>
introduction can also be conducted at a step of the compound (3b) or the compound (4c).<br>
Additionally, the prodrug of the compound according to the present invetion can<br>
be prepared by introducing a specific group during the steps from starting materials to<br>
intermediates, in the same manner as for the above protecting groups, or by carrying out<br>
the reaction using the obtained compound according to the present invention.    The<br>
reaction can be carried out by applying a method known by a person skilled in the art, such<br>
as general N-alkylation, esterification, amidation, dehydration, and the like.<br>
Hereinbelow, typical production processes of the compound according to the<br>
present invention will be described.   Each of the production processes can also be carried<br>
out with reference to the documents appended to the description herein.   Further, the<br>
production process of the present invention is not limited to the examples as shown below.<br>
In addition, the compound according to the present invention having a skeleton not<br>
included in the typical production processes can be prepared based on the description in<br>
Preparative Examples and Examples as described later, or using a method in accordance<br>
with the description, or by a modified method thereof.<br>
[0046]<br>
(First Production Process)<br>
[Chem. 7]<br>
(The symbols in the formula represent the meanings as described above and R<br>
represents C1-6 alkyl.   The same shall apply hereinafter.)<br>
[0047]<br>
The present production process is a method for preparing a compound (lc) or a<br>
compound (le) by reducing a compound (la) and carrying out a reductive animation or<br>
alkyl addition reaction for the obtained compound (lb) or compound (Id), respectively.<br>
[0048]<br>
(Step 1)<br>
The present step is a step for subjecting the compound (la) to a reduction reaction,<br>
and either or both of two kinds of product, that is, the compound (lb) and the compound<br>
(Id) may be obtained in some cases.   As a typical example of the reduction reaction of the<br>
present step, a reduction reaction by hydrogenation with a Raney Nickel catalyst can be<br>
exemplified.<br>
The present reduction reaction is usually carried out by stirring for 1 hour to 120<br>
hours in a solvent inert to the reaction from 0°C to under heating, and preferably at 0°C to<br>
room temperature, in the presence of a Raney nickel.   The solvent to be used herein is not<br>
particularly limited, but examples thereof include alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, 2-<br>
propanol, and the like; water; aprotic polar solvents such as N,N-dimethyl formamide,<br>
N,N-dimethylacetamide, N-methyl pyrrolidone, dimethylsulfoxide, and the like; and a<br>
mixed solvent thereof.   The reaction is carried out at a hydrogen atmosphere of 1 atm to 5<br>
atm.<br>
[0049]<br>
(Step 2-1)<br>
The present step is a step for preparing the compound according to the present<br>
invention in which R2 is -H by cyclizing the compound (lb) obtained in the step 1 by a<br>
reductive amination reaction.<br>
The reductive amination reaction is carried out by usually stirring for 0.1 hour to 5<br>
hours in a solvent inert to the reaction at -45 °C to heating under reflux, preferably at 0°C to<br>
room temperature, in the presence of a reducing agent.   The solvent to be used herein is<br>
not particularly limited, but examples thereof include alcohols; ethers such as diethyl ether,<br>
tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, dimethoxy ethane, diglyme, and the like; halogenated<br>
hydrocarbons such as dichloromethane, chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, dichloroethane,<br>
and the like; or acetic acid; and a mixture thereof.    Examples of the reducing agent<br>
include sodium cyanoborohydride, sodium triacetoxyborohydride, sodium borohydride,<br>
and the like.   It is preferable in some cases to carry out the reaction in the presence of a<br>
dehydrating agent such as molecular sieves, and the like or an acid such as acetic acid,<br>
hydrochloric acid, a titanium (IV) isopropoxide complex, and the like.   Depending on the<br>
reaction, the compound may be isolated as an imine intermediate, that is, as the compound<br>
(1d) in some cases, and the compound (1d) may be directly obtained in the step 1 in some<br>
cases.   In such a case, an imine product can be reduced by a reducing agent such as<br>
sodium borohydride, lithium aluminum hydride, and the like to obtain a desired compound<br>
(lc).   Further, instead of the treatment with a reducing agent, reduction in accordance<br>
with the step 1 of the first production process, or a reduction reaction using palladium-<br>
supported carbon instead of Raney nickel can be employed in a solvent such as alcohols,<br>
ethyl acetate, and the like in the presence or absence of an acid such as acetic acid,<br>
hydrochloric acid and the like.<br>
[0050]<br>
(Step 2-2)<br>
The present step is a step for preparing the compound according to the present<br>
invention in which R2 is C1-6 alkyl by subjecting the compound (1d) obtained as an<br>
intermediate of the step 1 or the step 2-1 to an alkyl addition reaction.<br>
The alkyl addition reaction is carried out by allowing an alkyl additive to undergo<br>
a reaction and usually stirring for 0.1 hour to 5 hours in a solvent inert to the reaction from<br>
-78°C to room temperature, preferably at -50°C to 0°C, and if necessary, in the presence of<br>
a Lewis acid.   The solvent to be used herein is not particularly limited, but examples<br>
thereof include ethers; saturated hydrocarbons such as hexane, pentane, heptane, and the<br>
like; aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene, xylene, and the like; and a mixture<br>
thereof.   Examples of the alkylating agent include alkyl lithium reagents such as methyl<br>
lithium, butyl lithium, and the like; Grignard reagents such as methyl magnesium bromide,<br>
ethyl magnesium chloride, and the like, and examples of the Lewis acid include a boron<br>
trifluoride diethyl ether complex, cerium chloride, magnesium bromide, and the like.<br>
[0051]<br>
(Second Production Process)<br>
[Chem. 8]<br><br>
(The symbols in the formula represent the meanings as described above.    The<br>
same shall apply hereinafter.)<br>
[0052]<br>
The present production process is a method for preparing a compound (2d) by<br>
carrying out a reduction reaction or alkyl addition reaction of ketone for the compound<br>
(la), converting the hydroxyl group of the obtained compound (2a) into an amino group,<br>
reducing the cyano group of the obtained compound (2b), and carrying out a reductive<br>
amination reaction for the obtained compound (2c).<br>
[0053]<br>
(Step 1)<br>
The present step is a step for carrying out a reduction reaction or alkyl addition<br>
reaction for the compound (la).<br>
The reduction reaction is carried out by allowing a reducing agent to undergo a<br>
reaction and usually stirring for 0.1 hour to 5 hours in a solvent inert to the reaction<br>
from -78°C to under heating, preferably at 0°C to room temperature. Examples of the<br>
solvent to be used herein include alcohols; ethers; aromatic hydrocarbons; and a mixed<br>
solvent thereof. Examples of the reducing agent include sodium borohydride, lithium<br>

of the first production process.<br>
[0054]<br>
(Step 2)<br>
The present step is a step for converting the hydroxyl group of the compound (2a)<br>
obtained in the step 1 into an amino group.    Specifically, for example, an azidation<br>
reaction can be carried out, and subsequently a reduction reaction can be carried out for the<br>
compound (2a).<br>
The azidation reaction is carried out by allowing an azidating agent to undergo a<br>
reaction and usually stirring for 0.1 hour to 5 hours in a solvent inert to the reaction, in the<br>
presence of an acid catalyst if necessary, and using an acid as a solvent as occasion<br>
demands, from -45°C to heating under reflux, preferably at 0°C to room temperature.<br>
The solvent to be used herein is not particularly limited, but examples thereof include<br>
halogenated hydrocarbons; aprotic polar solvent; ethers; aromatic hydrocarbons; and a<br>
mixture thereof.   Examples of the acid catalyst include trichloroacetic acid, trifluoroacetic<br>
acid, a boron trifluoride diethyl ether complex, and the like, and examples of the azidating<br>
agent include sodium azide, lithium azide, trimethylsilyl azide, and the like.<br>
Subsequently, the reduction reaction is carried out by allowing a phosphine<br>
compound to undergo a reaction and usually stirring for 1 hour to 24 hours in a solvent<br>
inert to the reaction, from 0°C to heating under reflux, preferably at room temperature.<br>
The solvent to be used herein is not particularly limited, but examples thereof include<br>
alcohols; ethers; and a mixed solvent thereof with water, and the like.    Examples of the<br>
phosphine compound include triphenyl phosphine and tributyl phosphine.   Further, this<br>
reduction reaction can also be carried out by usually stirring for 1 hour to 24 hours in an<br>
inert solvent from 0°C to heating under reflux, preferably at room temperature, in the<br>
presence of a catalytic reduction catalyst and a hydrogen source.   The solvent to be used<br>
herein is not particularly limited, but examples thereof include alcohols; ethers; ethyl<br>
acetate, a mixed solvent thereof with water, and the like.   Examples of the catalytic<br>
reduction catalyst include palladium-supported carbon, Raney nickel, platinum oxide, and<br>
the like, and examples of the hydrogen source include hydrogen, ammonium formate, and<br>
the like, under ambient pressure to under pressure.    Furthermore, this reduction reaction<br>
can also be carried out by allowing a reducing agent such as lithium aluminum hydride,<br>
and the like to undergo a reaction in ethers; aromatic hydrocarbons as a solvent, from 0°C<br>
to heating under reflux, preferably from room temperature to under warming.<br>
[0055]<br>
(Step 3)<br>
The present step is a step for subjecting the compound (2b) obtained in the step 2<br>
to a reduction reaction.<br>
The reduction reaction is carried out by allowing a reducing agent to undergo a<br>
reaction and usually stirring for 0.1 hour to 5 hours in a solvent inert to the reaction<br>
from -78°C to room temperature, preferably at -50°C to 0°C.   The solvent to be used<br>
herein is not particularly limited, but examples thereof include ethers; aromatic<br>
hydrocarbons; and a mixed solvent thereof.   As the reducing agent, diisobutylaluminum<br>
hydride is suitably used.<br>
[0056]<br>
(Step 4)<br>
The present step is a step for preparing the compound according to the present<br>

[0075]<br>
Text Example 1    MK-801 Binding Test<br>
1) Preparation of Specimens of Rat Meninges<br>
The whole brain was taken out from 30 10-week SD rats (Nippon SLC), and the<br>
cerebellum was removed.   A 0.32 M aqueous sucrose solution was added to the part<br>
containing the cerebrum, followed by cutting by a mixer and homogenizing with a Teflon<br>
(registered trademark) homogenizer.   After centrifugation at 2800 rpm at 4°C for 15<br>
minutes, the resulting supernatant was again centrifuged at 15000 g at 4°C for 20 minutes.<br>
The pellets were suspended in 50 mM Tris-HCL (pH 7.5) containing 0.08% Triton X-100,<br>
and kept statically on ice for 30 minutes, then centrifuged at 15000 g at 4°C for 20<br>
minutes.   The pellets were suspended in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) added thereto, and<br>
centrifuged at 15000 g at 4°C for 20 minutes.   50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) was again added<br>
to the pellets, and centrifuged in the same manner as before.    The pellets were suspended<br>
in 20 ml of 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) added thereto, and homogenized with the Teflon<br>
(registered trademark) homogenizer.   The membrane specimen was dispensed<br>
portionwise into tubes and stored in a deep freezer (-80°C).   For use, this was washed<br>
twice with 5 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) of five times the volume of the membrane specimen.<br>
After controlling the concentration at 1 mg protein/ml with 5 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), it<br>
was used for assay.<br>
[0076]<br>
2) [3H] MK-801 Binding Assay<br>
50 µl of the rat membrane specimen (1 mg protein/ml) was added to a solution of a<br>
test compound dissolved in 1 ul of dimethylsulfoxide.   Then, 50 ul of a ligand solution<br>
(600 nM glutamate, 600 nM glycine, 8 nM [3H] MK-801 (Perkin-Elmer) was added thereto<br>
and well stirred, followed by the reaction at room temperature for 45 minutes.    Using Uni<br>
Filter Plate GF/B 96 (Perkin-Elmer) previously coated with 0.2% polyethyleneimine, the<br>
membrane specimen was collected, and the filter was well washed with 5 mM Tris-HCl<br>
(pH 7.5).    30 ul of Microscinti 20 (Perkin-Elmer) was added to the filter, and the<br>
radioactivity trapped on the filter was measured by a microplate scintillation counter<br>
(TopCount™; Beckman).   Based on the MK-801 (final 1 uM) inhibition, 100%, of a<br>
control case of dimethylsulfoxide alone, the concentration of the compound for 50%<br>
inhibition, IC50 was computed.   Inhibition rate of MK-801 (final concentration: 1 uM)<br>
relative to the case in which dimethylsulfoxide alone was added was set to 100%, the<br>
concentration in which the test compound showed 50% inhibition rate was calculated as<br>
IC50. The [ H] MK-801 binding affinity for the rat membrane specimen was calculated to<br>
be Kd=l .6 nM through Scatchard analysis.   The Ki value of the compound was computed<br>
according to the calculation equation: Ki=IC50/(l+radioligand concentration (4 nM) in<br>
assay)/Kd value (1.6 nM)).<br>
As a result, some of the compounds according to the present invention exhibited<br>
binding affinity for an NMDA receptor with 10 µM or less of a Ki value in the test above.<br>

FLIPR (Fluorometric Imaging Plate Reader)<br>
1) Preparation of Rat First-Generation Neurocytes<br>
Anesthetized with ether, Wistar rats (Nippon SLC) at the 19th day of pregnancy<br>
were let die from blood loss by breast incision.   The abdomen was cut open, and the<br>
womb was extracted, and the fetus was removed.   The whole brain was removed, the<br>
hemicerebrum was then isolated in Neurobasal medium (Glu, Asp-free; Gibco), and the<br>
meninx was removed.   The hemicerebrum was recovered by centrifugation, and<br>
suspended in a cell-dispersing solution (0.36 mg/ml papain, 150 U/ml DNase 1,0.02% L-<br>
cysteine monohydrochloride monohydrate, 0.02% bovine serum albumin, 0.5% glucose,<br>
Ca2+, Mg2+-free PBS), and treated at 37°C for 15 minutes.    This was centrifuged at 400 g<br>
for 5 minutes, and the supernatant was removed by suction.   This was suspended in a<br>
neurocyte culture medium (Sumitomo Bakelite), and the cell masses were removed using a<br>
filter.   The number of the living cells was counted, and 100,000 cells/well were incubated<br>
on a 96-well plate (Biocoat PDL96W black/clear (Nippon Becton Dickinson)) (37°C, 5%<br>
C02).<br>

2) Intracellular Calcium Concentration Determination by FLIPR (Fluorometric<br>
Imaging Plate Reader)<br>
The culture medium of rat first-generation neurocytes (DIV7-9) was removed by<br>
suction, and the cells were washed once with a 100 µl assay buffer (Hank's Balanced Salt<br>
Solution (Ca2+, Mg2+-free), 20 mM Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.4), 1 mM CaCl2).    100 µl of the<br>
assay buffer containing Fluo3 (Dojin Chemical) was added thereto, and incubated for 1<br>
hour (37°C, 5% CO2).   The cells were washed three times with 100 µl of the assay buffer,<br>
and then a compound solution dissolved in 1 ul of dimethylsulfoxide, and 100 µl of the<br>
assay buffer containing 2.5 uM (final concentration) tetrodotoxin were added thereto and<br>
incubated for 30 minutes (37°C, 5% CO2).   The fluorescent intensity was measured at<br>
intervals of two seconds, and ten seconds after the measurement start, 50 ul of a ligand<br>
solution (Hank's Balanced Salt Solution (Ca2+, Mg2+-free), 20 mM Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.4),<br>
1 mM CaCh, 9 µM NMD A, 30 uM glycine) containing the compound solution dissolved<br>
in 0.5 ul of dimethylsulfoxide was added therero, and the fluorescent intensity was<br>
measured for 120 seconds from the start of the measurement.    The data measured for total<br>
of 120 seconds (60 times in total) were averaged.    Inhibition rate of 10 uM MK-801<br>
relative to the case in which dimethylsulfoxide alone was added was set to 100%, the<br>
concentration in which the compound showed 50% inhibition rate was calculated as IC50-<br>
As a result, some of the compounds according to the present invention exhibited<br>
an NMDA receptor antagonistic action with 100 µM or less of IC50 values in the test<br>
above.   The results of some of Example compounds in the present test are shown in Table<br>
