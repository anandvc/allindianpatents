Ruthenium complexes having (P-P)-coordinated<br>
disphosphorus donor ligands and processes<br>
for preparing them<br>
Description<br>
The present invention relates to ruthenium complexes<br>
for homogeneous catalysis, in particular P-P-<br>
coordinated cyclic ruthenium complexes having chiral<br>
diphosphorus donor ligands. The invention further<br>
provides processes for preparing them and also the use<br>
of these complexes as catalysts for homogeneous<br>
catalysis, in particular for enantioselective<br>
hydrogenation.<br>
Chiral diphosphorus donor ligands have been found to be<br>
valuable ligands for catalytically active metal<br>
complexes which are used in homogeneous catalysis for<br>
the enantioselective hydrogenation of organic<br>
compounds. Fields of use are the preparation of<br>
intermediates or active compounds, for example<br>
pharmaceuticals, pesticides, flavors or fragrances.<br>
In enantioselective hydrogenation, these diphosphorus<br>
donor ligands are used together with suitable noble<br>
metal complexes.<br>
Organometallic Ru compounds used in these<br>
hydrogenations are, for example, [Ru(COD)Y2]x,<br>
[Ru(NBD)Y2]x, [Ru(aromatic)Y2]x or [Ru(COD)2-methyl-<br>
allyl)2] (where X = 2; Y = halide, COD = 1,5-cyclo-<br>
octadiene, NBD = norbornadiene, aromatic = for example<br>
p-cumene or another benzene derivative).<br>
EP 1622920B1 discloses transition metal complexes<br>
having ferrocenyldiphosphine ligands. Complexes having<br>
 <br>
specific P-P coordination of the phosphine ligands are<br>
Ru complexes having (P-P)-coordinated diphosphorus<br>
donor ligands are known from the literature.<br>
M. Sato and M. Asai (J. of Organometallic Chemistry 508<br>
(1996) pp. 121-127) describe permethylcyclopentadienyl-<br>
Ru'(ll) complexes having dppf, BINAP and DIOP ligands.<br>
As a result of the permethylcyclopentadienyl radical,<br>
these complexes are very stable; use for catalytic<br>
hydrogenation is not described.<br>
C. Standfest-Hauser, C. Slugovc et al. (J. Chem. Soc.<br>
Dalton Trans., 2001, pp. 2989-2995) report cyclic<br>
Ru(II) semisandwich complexes which likewise have a<br>
cyclopentadienyl ligand and also chelating phosphino-<br>
amine ligands. These complexes contain a cyclopenta-<br>
dienyl ligand ("Cp ligand") and are not very suitable<br>
for use as catalysts for homogeneous asymmetric<br>
hydrogenation. They are normally used in a specific<br>
catalysis reaction (namely transfer hydrogenation),<br>
with the Cp ligand stabilizing the catalyst and having<br>
to be coordinated to the metal during catalysis.<br>
J.B. Hoke et al. (J. of Organomet. Chem., 1993, 455,<br>
pp. 193-196) describe ruthenium complexes in which<br>
BINAP ligands form a seven-member ed ring with the Ru.<br>
The complexes contain one cyclopentadienyl group. They<br>
are very stable but display little activity in<br>
catalytic hydrogenation and some of them are<br>
unselective since the Cp ligand is bound very strongly<br>
to the metal.<br>
P.S. Pregosin et al. (Organometallics, 1997, 16, pp.<br>
537-543) have reported a ruthenium complex which bears<br>
the MeO-BIPHEP ligand and additionally has a cycloocta-<br>
 <br>
dienyl radical. The complex can be prepared only by<br>
means of a complicated process and is very air- and<br>
moisture-sensitive. Use for catalytic hydrogenation is<br>
not described. A similar complex bearing the BINAP<br>
ligand has been described by S.H. Bergens et al.<br>
(Organometallics, 2004, 23, pp. 4564-4568). An aceto-<br>
nitrile complex was isolated in the synthesis and this<br>
is not very active in catalysis.<br>
A. Salzer et al. (Organometallics, 2000, 19, pp. 5471-<br>
5476) have reported the preparation of a seven-membered<br>
BINAP-ruthenium complex from a (bispentadienyl)Ru<br>
compound as starting complex.<br>
D.A. Dobbs et al. (Angew. Chem. 2000, volume 112, pp.<br>
2080-2083) describe a ruthenium-containing precatalyst<br>
having a P-P-coordinated DuPhos ligand. The cyclic<br>
compound is an Ru hybrid species and has an uncharged<br>
cyclooctatrienyl ligand. It is very sensitive and was<br>
prepared in a glove box (inert gas: Ar containing<br>

very suitable for industrial use.<br>
WO 00/37478 describes transition metal complexes which<br>
have a metal atom of transition group 7 or 8 and in<br>
which both P atoms of a diphosphine ligand are<br>
simultaneously coordinated to the central atom, but the<br>
complexes are neither isolated nor characterized. No<br>
preparative method is described; rather, the complexes<br>
are generated by combining the ligands and the<br>
appropriate transition metal salts in the reaction<br>
solvent shortly before use ("in-situ"). These in-situ<br>
processes are prior art. Few studies have hitherto been<br>
carried out on the structure of the metal complexes<br>
generated in-situ; the corresponding complexes were not<br>
isolated but instead used directly in the reaction<br>
mixture for homogeneous catalysis, in particular for<br>
 <br>
catalytic hydrogenation. The mechanistic studies are<br>
carried out using model systems which do not correspond<br>
to the real active catalytic species.<br>
US 6,455,460 describes a ruthenium catalyst obtainable<br>
by a process which comprises putting together an<br>
appropriate Ru(II) complex, a chelating diphosphine and<br>
an acid comprising an non-coordinating anion. The<br>
reaction is performed under an oxygen-free atmosphere.<br>
Disadvantages of the catalytic hydrogenation processes<br>
described hitherto and the catalysts used therein are,<br>
in particular, the low reactivity, the low<br>
enantioselectivities and a high consumption of noble<br>
metal-containing catalyst, i.e. a low<br>
"substrate/catalyst" (S/C) ratio. Furthermore, long<br>
hydrogenation times are required. In addition, many of<br>
the complexes described are difficult to synthesize,<br>
are air-sensitive and are not very suitable for<br>
industrial use.<br>
It was therefore an object of the present invention to<br>
provide improved catalysts for homogeneous, asymmetric<br>
hydrogenation which overcome the abovementioned<br>
disadvantages. A further object was to provide suitable<br>
processes for preparing the catalysts of the invention.<br>
In particular, these processes should be able to be<br>
used in industry and be environmentally friendly and<br>
inexpensive.<br>
This object is achieved by the provision of the<br>
ruthenium complexes of the types A and B as claimed in<br>
claim 1 of the invention. Furthermore, processes for<br>
preparing the inventive complexes of types A and B are<br>
provided in claims 12 and 22. Preferred embodiments of<br>
the complexes and the processes are described in the<br>
respective dependent claims.<br>
 <br>
The present invention describes ruthenium complexes<br>
having a chirai diphosphorus donor iigand of the<br>
P(1)-P(2) type for homogeneous catalysis. The complexes<br>
are of two different types (type A and type B) , with<br>
the ruthenium having the oxidation state +II and the<br>
diphosphorus donor ligands displaying bidentate P-P<br>
coordination to the Ru. The ruthenium complexes of the<br>
invention are cyclic and together with the diphosphorus<br>
donor ligand have a four- to six-membered ring.<br>
In the search for well-defined Ru complexes having<br>
these chiral diphosphorus donor ligands, it has<br>
surprisingly been found that simultaneous coordination<br>
of both P atoms of the diphosphorus donor ligands to a<br>
central Ru atom can be achieved under particular<br>
conditions. This gives cyclic Ru complexes which have a<br>
four- to six-membered ring in their structure and<br>
display very good catalytic activity in homogeneous<br>
catalysis.<br>
The effect of P-P coordination is obtained by use of<br>
diphosphorus donor ligands P(l)-P(2) which are<br>
sterically able to form a four- to six-membered ring<br>
with the central Ru atom. For the purposes of the<br>
present patent application, Ru complexes bearing<br>
ferrocenylphosphine ligands having phosphine groups on<br>
the different Cp rings have a six-membered ring. The<br>
ferrocene unit P-C-Fe-C-P makes available five ring<br>
atoms of the ring formed. The numbering of the ring<br>
members used here is shown schematically in figure 1.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
The chiral diphosphorus donor ligand P(l)-P(2) is<br>
generally selected from the group consisting of<br>
diphosphines, diphospholanes, diphosphites, diphospho-<br>
nites and diazaphospholanes.<br>
Examples of suitable diphosphorus donor ligands for<br>
preparing four-membered cyclic Ru complexes are the<br>
ligands of the MiniPhos and Trichickenfootphos<br>
families.<br>
Examples of suitable diphosphorus donor ligands for<br>
preparing five-membered cyclic Ru complexes are the<br>
ligands of the families DIPAMP, Norphos, PROPHOS,<br>
DuPHOS, Chiraphos, Bis-P* family, DepyPhos (or<br>
DeguPhos), RoPhos, CATAXIUM, ButiPhane, (1,2-ethylene)-<br>
BinaPhane, (1,2-phenylene)-BinaPhane, Binapine,<br>
TangPhos, BPE, BasPhos, MalPhos, Me-KetalPhos, Helmchen<br>
ligands, PennPhos, UCAP, Hoge ligands and CNR-Phos.<br>
However, the use range of the invention is not<br>
restricted to these ligands.<br>
Examples of suitable diphosphorus donor ligands for<br>
preparing six-membered cyclic Ru complexes are the<br>
ligands of the families BDPP (or SKEWPHOS), BPPFOH,<br>
MandyPhos, JosiPhos, FerroTANE Me-f-KetalPhos,<br>
Ferrocelane, Trifer and (1,1'-ferrocene)-BinaPhane.<br>
However, the use range of the invention is not<br>
restricted to these ligands.<br>
A preferred embodiment of the invention comprises<br>
ruthenium complexes having five- or six-membered rings.<br>
Preferred ligand systems are the ligands of the<br>
DepyPhos (Deguphos) family which form five-membered<br>
rings and the Josiphos and Mandyphos ligands which lead<br>
to six-membered rings.<br>
 <br>
The diphosphorus donor ligands indicated above can have<br>
axial, central and/or planar chirality and are in most<br>
cases commercially available. When these ligands are<br>
used in the preparative process of the invention,<br>
cyclic Ru complexes having a four- to six-membered ring<br>
in their structure are obtained. However, other chiral<br>
diphosphorus donor ligands are also suitable, as long<br>
as they make formation of a four- to six-membered ring<br>
possible.<br>
The present invention further provides a process for<br>
preparing the inventive ruthenium complexes of the<br>
types A and B, in which specific Ru starting compounds<br>
are reacted with a chiral diphosphorus donor ligand or<br>
the ruthenium complex of type A is reacted with a<br>
further ligand.<br>
The effect of P-P coordination in the ruthenium<br>
complexes of the invention is achieved in the present<br>
preparative process by use of a specific Ru starting<br>
compound in which the central Ru atom is in the<br>
oxidation state +11 and which has at least three<br>
uncharged ligands LD.<br>
It has the following general formula<br>
 <br>
wherein<br>
- Ru is in the oxidation state +11,<br>
- n is an integer obeying n &gt; 3,<br>
- LD is an uncharged ligand,<br>
- Z is a n-bonded anionic open pentadienyl ligand<br>
and<br>
- E" is the anion of an oxo acid or complex acid.<br>
 <br>
The at least three uncharged ligands LD belong to the<br>
class of 2-electron doner ligands, for example<br>
secondary or tertiary phosphines (ligands of the PR2H or<br>
PR3 type, for example triphenylphosphine) or<br>
N-heterocyclic carbene ligands (known as NHC ligands).<br>
The ligands LD are preferably weakly bound to the<br>
central Ru atom. At least two of these ligands are<br>
replaced in the reaction with a chiral diphosphorus<br>
donor ligand. Examples of suitable ligands LD are<br>
ligands from the group consisting of nitriles,<br>
isonitriles, alcohols, ethers, amines, acid amides,<br>
lactams and sulfones; for example acetonitrile (CH3CN) ,<br>
diethyl ether (DEE), water (H2O) or acetone. It is also<br>
possible to use cyclic ligands such as tetrahydrofuran<br>
(THF), dioxane, pyridine, imidazole or thiophene. Mixed<br>
systems comprising different types of ligands are also<br>
possible. However, solvent ligands from the group<br>
consisting of acetonitrile (CH3CN), diethyl ether, water<br>
and acetone are preferred.<br>
Furthermore, the Ru starting compound has a π-bonded<br>
anionic (i.e. singly negatively charged) ligand Z.<br>
Ligands Z encompass open (i.e. acyclic) pentadienyl<br>
ligands. Such ligands can be substituted or<br>
unsubstituted. They have a delocalized n-electron<br>
system. The substituted pentadienyl ligands can be<br>
monosubstituted, disubstituted or trisubstituted.<br>
Preferred substituted pentadienyl ligands Z are<br>
1-methylpentadienyl, 2-methylpentadienyl, 3-phenyl-<br>
pentadienyl, 2,4-dimethylpentadienyl or 2,3,4-tri-<br>
methylpentadienyl.<br>
Closed, cyclic aromatic TC-systems such as substituted<br>
or unsubstituted cyclopentadienyl ligands are not<br>
suitable as ligands Z. It has been found that such<br>
cyclopentadienyl ligands are bound very strongly to the<br>
 <br>
central Ru atom because of the high electron density of<br>
the aromatic π-electron system present. This hinders<br>
access of reactants during the catalysis reaction, for<br>
example in a catalytic hydrogenation. Thus, for<br>
example, the coordination of the compound to be<br>
hydrogenated to the Ru atom is made difficult in a<br>
hydrogenation reaction, as a result of which the<br>
corresponding Ru complex has a low reactivity as<br>
catalyst.<br>
The Ru starting compound used for the process of the<br>
invention is present in the form of a cation having a<br>
single positive charge and has, as further constituent,<br>
E" (the anion of an oxo acid or complex acid) as<br>
counterion. Examples of anions E" are HSO4-, CF3SO3",<br>
CIO4-, CF3COO-, CH3COO-, BF4-, B(aryl)4-, SbF6- or PF6-.<br>
Examples of suitable Ru starting compounds are<br>
[Ru(2,4-dimethylpentadienyl) (CH3CN)3]"BF4", [Ru(2,4-di-<br>
methylpentadienyl) (H2O)3]+BF4- and [Ru(2,4-dimethylpenta-<br>
dienyl) (acetone) 3]+BF4-. The Ru starting compound can<br>
firstly be prepared from known, commercially available<br>
Ru precursor compounds (e.g. bis(η5-(2, 4-dimethylpenta-<br>
dienyl)Ru) by reaction with the appropriate ligand LD<br>
according to process steps known from the literature.<br>
It has been found that the reaction of the above-<br>
described Ru starting compound with the suitable chiral<br>
diphosphorus donor ligands (hereinafter referred to as<br>
P(l)-P(2) for short) gives the Ru complexes of the<br>
invention. The formation of the complex of type A<br>
occurs by ligand exchange in the preparative process<br>
according to eq. (1):<br>
 <br>
Equation (1):<br>
 <br>
The inventive Ru complex of type A is obtained<br>
according to eq. (1). This complex is cationic, i.e.<br>
singly positively charged. In the preparation of the<br>
complex, the chiral diphosphorus donor ligand is<br>
reacted with the above-described Ru starting compound,<br>
with at least two of the ligands LD being replaced in<br>
the reaction. If the Ru starting compound has more than<br>
two ligands LD, the remaining ligands LD stay<br>
coordinated to the ruthenium. They can be replaced or<br>
eliminated in a subsequent step. This gives the<br>
inventive Ru complex of type B.<br>
The preparation of the Ru complexes of types A and B is<br>
preferably carried out under a protective gas<br>
atmosphere using the Schlenk technique and oxygen-free<br>
solvents. However, this is not necessary in all cases.<br>
To prepare type A, the diphosphorus donor ligands are<br>
typically reacted with the Ru starting compound in a<br>
suitable solvent at temperatures in the range from<br>
-80°C to 80°C, preferably in the range from 20 to 60°C<br>
and particularly preferably at room temperature (25°C) ,<br>
while stirring.<br>
Suitable solvents are chlorinated hydrocarbons such as<br>
chloroform, methylene chloride, trichloroethane or<br>
dichloroethane. However, preference is given to using<br>
dipolar, aprotic solvents such as acetone, THF or<br>
dioxane. The reaction times are in the range from<br>
 <br>
1 hour to 48 hours, preferably in the range from 1 hour<br>
tc 24 hours. It can be advantageous to use the ligand<br>
in a small excess in the preparation of the Ru<br>
complexes of type A, with the excess being able to be<br>
in the range from 1 to 10 mol-% (based on the Ru<br>
starting compound). The subsequent isolation, washing<br>
and purification steps are well known to those skilled<br>
in the art. To remove solvent residues, the complexes<br>
ar,e dried under reduced pressure.<br>
The present invention further provides Ru complexes of<br>
type B. These complexes are overall electrically<br>
neutral and have a negatively charged ligand L2 in<br>
addition to the P-P-coordinated chiral diphosphorus<br>
donor ligand, the n-bonded anionic pentadienyl ligand Z<br>
and, if present, the ligand LD. This ligand Lz is<br>
introduced by replacement of one of the ligands LD by an<br>
anion, preferably a halide ion (fluoride, chloride,<br>
bromide or iodide) or a pseudohalide ion (e.g. CN-,<br>
SCN-, cyanate, isocyanate, etc.).<br>
The Ru complex of type B is preferably prepared from<br>
the complex of type A by ligand exchange, for example<br>
by replacement of an acetonitrile molecule by iodide<br>
(cf. example 2). Equation (2) describes the replacement<br>
of the ligand LD by a negatively charged ligand Lz) :<br>
Equation (2):<br>
 <br>
To carry out the reaction according to equation (2),<br>
the cationic Ru complex (type A) is reacted in suitable<br>
 <br>
solvents such as chlorinated hydrocarbons (e.g.<br>
chloroform, methylene chloride, trichloroethane or<br>
dichloroethane), alcohols, ketones (e.g. acetone) or<br>
cyclic ethers (e.g. THF or dioxane). However,<br>
preference is given to using aqueous solvent mixtures,<br>
in particular a mixture of a dipolar, aprotic solvent<br>
with deionized water. Here, the cationic Ru complex<br>
(type A) is, for example, dissolved in acetone/water<br>
(2:1) and reacted with the ligand Lz at temperatures in<br>
the range from 0° to 50°C. The ligand Lz is preferably<br>
added in the form of a salt M+Lz, for example in the<br>
form of an alkali metal halide or ammonium halide. The<br>
product generally precipitates and can be separated<br>
off.<br>
The aqueous solvent mixtures are particularly suitable<br>
for industrial syntheses for reasons of environmental<br>
protection and occupational hygiene. It has<br>
surprisingly been found that the chlorinated<br>
hydrocarbons used hitherto can be replaced as solvents<br>
without decreases in yield.<br>
The inventive Ru complexes of type A<br>
 <br>
and of type B<br>
 <br>
where in each case<br>
- Ru is present in the oxidation state +II,<br>
 <br>
-	P(l)-P(2) is a chiral diphosphorus donor ligand,<br>
-	n is an integer which obeys n ≥ 3,<br>
-	LD is at least one uncharged ligand,<br>
-	Z is a n-bonded anionic open pentadienyl ligand,<br>
-	E- is an anion of an oxo acid or complex acid and<br>
-	Lz is at least one anionic ligand,<br>
and the chiral diphosphorus donor ligand P(l)-P(2)<br>
has bidentate P-P coordination and forms a four-<br>
to six-membered ring with the ruthenium,<br>
are effective homogeneous catalysts for the asymmetric<br>
hydrogenation of prochiral organic compounds.<br>
A shared characteristic of the inventive Ru complexes<br>
of types A and B is the presence of the anionic open<br>
pentadienyl ligand in the complex. It has surprisingly<br>
been found that this gives a higher reactivity of the<br>
Ru complexes in catalysis, in particular in asymmetric<br>
hydrogenation. The open pentadienyl ligand is<br>
presumably easier to destabilize than closed ligand<br>
systems such as cyclopentadienyl and cyclooctadienyl,<br>
so that it can make available a coordination site for<br>
the substrate molecule to be hydrogenated. It has<br>
surprisingly been found that the ligands LD and/or Lz<br>
also play a very important role. They presumably block<br>
a coordination site so that the substrate can<br>
coordinate to the metal only in a particular way, as a<br>
result of which the enantioselectivity is increased.<br>
The inventive Ru complexes of types A and B are<br>
therefore used as catalysts for homogeneous asymmetric<br>
catalysis, for example for the enantioselective<br>
hydrogenation of multiple bonds. For the purposes of<br>
the present invention, multiple bonds are double bonds<br>
between a carbon atom and a further carbon atom (C=C)<br>
or oxygen atom (C=O) or nitrogen atom (C=N).<br>
 <br>
Furthermore, the ruthenium complexes of the invention<br>
can also be used as catalysts for other asymmetric<br>
reactions. These include C-C, C-O, C-N, C-P, C-Si, C-B<br>
or C-halogen coupling reactions. Examples are<br>
asymmetric cyclization reactions, asymmetric<br>
oligomerizations and asymmetric polymerization<br>
reactions.<br>
The inventive ruthenium(II) complexes of types A and B<br>
are used as defined compounds. In comparison, Ru<br>
complexes which are used together with the diphosphorus<br>
donor ligands in in-situ processes display poorer<br>
catalytic properties.<br>
The following examples illustrate the invention without<br>
restricting its scope.<br>
 <br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Example 1:<br>
Preparation of (η5-2,4-dimethylpentadienyl) (CH3CN)-<br>
(Josiphos-SL-J212-l)ruthenium(ll) tetrafluoroborate<br>
a)	Preparation	of	(η4-2 , 4-dimethylpentadiene-η2-<br>
C, H) (η5-2, 4-dimethylpentadienyl) ruthenium tetra-<br>
fluoroborate<br>
In a 100 ml Schlenk tube provided with a magnetic<br>
stirrer, 1.1 g (3.77 mmol) of bis (η5-2,4-dimethylpenta-<br>
dienyl) ruthenium (UMICORE, Hanau) are dissolved in<br>
50 ml of diethyl ether. 0.51 ml (3.77 mmol) of a 54%<br>
strength HBF4-Et2O solution (from Aldrich) is added<br>
dropwise at room temperature over a period of<br>
10 minutes. After the addition is complete, the mixture<br>
is allowed to settle and the completeness of<br>
precipitation is tested by addition of a further drop<br>
of HBF4-Et2O. The supernatant solvent is taken off and<br>
the solid is washed twice with diethyl ether. The<br>
light-yellow residue is dried under reduced pressure.<br>
Yield: 1.43 g (100%).<br>
b)	Preparation of the acetonitrile complex (T)5-<br>
2, 4-dimethylpentadienyl) (CH3CN)3ruthenium(II)<br>
tetrafluoroborate (starting compound)<br>
0.41 g (1.1 mmol) of (η4-2,4-dimethylpentadiene-η2-<br>
C,H) (η5-2, 4-dimethylpentadienyl) ruthenium tetrafluoro-<br>
borate prepared in step a) are admixed with 10 ml of<br>
acetonitrile. The orange solution is stirred for<br>
10 minutes and the solvent is removed under reduced<br>
pressure to give an orange solid. Yield: 0.44 g (100%).<br>
 <br>
c) Preparation of (T)5-2,4-dimethylpentadienyl)(CH3CN)-<br>
(Josiphos SL J212-1) ruthenium(II) tetrafluoroborate<br>
In a 50 ml round-bottomed flask provided with a<br>
magnetic stirrer, the acetonitrile complex (η5-2,4-di-<br>
methylpentadienyl) (CH3CN) 3ruthenium(II) tetrafluoro-<br>

6 hours. 50 ml of n-hexane are then added dropwise to<br>
the solution. A red-orange solid precipitates and is<br>
filtered off. The residual solvent is removed at room<br>
temperature under reduced pressure. This gives a<br>
product as a mixture of three diastereomers, yield:<br>
95%. The P-P coordination of the ligand (and thus the<br>
presence of a 6-membered ring) is demonstrated by the<br>
31P MMR spectrum.<br>
Characterization:<br>

tetrafluoroborate prepared as described in example 1b)<br>
(1.50 mg, 0.18 mmol) is dissolved in 4 ml of acetone and<br>
2 ml of water and stirred with lithium iodide (LiI,<br>
28.5 mg, 0.21 mmol) at room temperature for 3 hours.<br>
The solution is evaporated to dryness at room<br>
temperature under reduced pressure. The residue is<br>
washed three times with 1 ml of water. This gives the<br>
product in the form of a diastereomerically pure<br>
compound. Yield: 90%. The P-P coordination of the<br>
SL-J-212-1 is demonstrated by the 31P-NMR spectrum.<br>
