The present invention relates generally to fuse-programmable integrated circuits, and more particularly, to integrated circuits having a fuse-read startup sequence.<br>
2.   Description of the Related Art:<br>
Fuse-programmable integrated circuits are used in applications requiring customization and/or repair of manufacturing defects.  Functional testing of integrated circuits and printed circuit boards is necessary to assure defect-free products.  In many instances, it is possible to repair integrated circuits subsequent to manufacture of a wafer by providing redundant circuit elements that can be selected by fuse-programmable logic For example, an entire column in a memory array may be replaced with a spare column, if there is a defect detected in one of the row cells that would otherwise make the memory unusable.  The redundant cells make it possible to increase production yields at the cost of increased circuit area via redundant circuits and fuse electronics.<br><br>
The above-mentioned fuses include electrically blown fuses (e-fuses) that may be programmed by passing a large current momentarily through a fuse, and laser programmable fuses that may be programmed by vaporizing material with a laser. An anti-fuse technology can also be implemented on an integrated circuitry where the fuse controls the gate of a transistor and the transistor conducts to produce a short when the fuse is blown.<br>
Application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) may include large quantities of embedded memory.  The included memories typically contain redundant circuit elements in order to repair defects.  The selection of replacement elements from the available redundant elements requires a large number of fuse values.  For example, embedded SRAM macros within the Cu-11 ASIC design system marketed by International Business Machines Corporation contain 80 fuse values per macro instance. Therefore, an ASIC using 128 instances of a macro containing 80 fuse values will result in a total of 10,240 fuse values.  Embedded dynamic random access meteor (eDRAM) macro designs typically include still more fuse values.  Each one megabit section of eDRAM in the Cu-11 ASIC design system contains 344 fuse values, and there may be as many as 256 - 1 megabit sections of eDRAM used within an ASIC design.  The resulting number of fuses will be 88,064 per ASIC chip.  It is desirable to reduce the number of required physical fuses to repair these integrated circuits.<br>
In circuits designed using functional blocks or<br><br>
macros, such as an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) built from a library of macro cells, the fuses for that cell will be associated with the macro. In correcting defects or customizing these ASICs, the co-location of the fuses presents a problem in that fuses are not typically compatible with the balance of the circuitry.  E-fuses require large circuit paths for the programming current so that the voltage drop produced during programming does not eliminate the ability to program the fuse, increase the programming time above acceptable limits, or increase local heating that may damage the functional electronics.  Laser-programmable fuses require a large guard ring so that other circuitry is not destroyed by the laser. Additionally, present integrated circuit designs provide for "deep" stacks of circuits, allowing macros to be located below wires within layers of the die.  Laser-programmed fuses and e-fuses are implemented with no wires allowed above and no circuitry allowed below the fuses, since the blowing of a fuse, whether by a laser or by an electrical means, could damage wires located over or circuitry located beneath the fuses.  Finally, interconnect methods such as lead ball contact arrays are incompatible with laser blown fuses since the laser needs to have direct "line of sight" access to the fuse.  Since the outer layer containing the contact array must occupy the surface layer, laser programmable fuses must be located in other areas of the die.<br>
The inability to locate macros containing fuses underneath other wires and contact arrays or above other<br><br>
circuits severely limits the use of macros containing fuses.  It is possible to move all of the fuses to a location where the fuses will not interfere with contact arrays, but moving fuses away from the associated macros requires custom design and either a large quantity of interconnects running from the fuses to the associated macros, or a scheme for moving the values from the fuses to their: associated macros requiring a local latch and a remote latch for each fuse. A local latch is typically needed at the fuse, since the fuse cannot typically be used to form part of the logic in the integrated circuit, especially with copper fuse technology.  If a potential is placed across the ends of a blown fuse, it will re-grow, forming ^^copper dendrites." The blown fuse may eventually have a low enough resistance to read as if it had not been blown.<br>
In light of the foregoing, it would be desirable to provide a method and apparatus for fuse-programming integrated circuits whereby fuses may be shared among redundant elements.  Furthermore, it would be desirable to provide a method and apparatus for fuse-programming integrated circuits using fuses that do not have to be located within their associated memory macros.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
All objects, features, and advantages of the present invention will become apparent in the following detailed written description.<br>
The objective of repairing macros within integrated circuits using remotely located fuses without requiring circuit runs from a fuse to macros or local latch/remote latch pairs is achieved in a method and apparatus for initializing an integrated circuit using compressed data from a remote fuse box.  Compressed control data is read from a fuse matrix and the compressed data is decoded to produce decompressed control data-  Then, the decompressed control data is latched to control functional circuit elements within the integrated circuit.  The invention may also be embodied in a multi-chip module where a single fusebox is used to initialize multiple dies.<br>
The above as well as additional objectives, features, and advantages of the present invention will become apparent in the following detailed written description.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
With reference now to the figures, and in particular with reference to Figure 1, there is depicted a block diagram of an integrated circuit in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the invention.  Integrated circuit 10 contains a plurality of fuse programmable macros 16.     Fuse-programmable macros 16 can implement a variety of functional circuits within integrated circuit 10 and are not necessarily identical or similar in nature, but are customizable and/or repairable using fuse data retrieved from a fusebox 11-  Repairable circuits include memory array macros wherein the fuse data is used to remove a memory element (e.g., a row or column ) and select a redundant element to replace its function.  It will be understood that replacement of memory elements can be accomplished with multiplexers and demultiplexers or a variety of other techniques well known in the art. Customizable circuits include programmable logic array macros wherein the fuse data is used to generate combinatorial logic, circuits that embed security codes on a per-integrated circuit basis, et cetera.<br>
The present invention concerns the manner in and means by which control data for controlling the customization and/or repair of integrated circuit 10 is accomplished.  Fuses 12 are arranged in a block isolated from the fuse-programmable macros, in order to overcome the obstacles associated with placing fuses such as interference with interconnect points, inefficient use of<br><br>
die area due to guard rings, laser-programmable fuses or e-fuses requiring the entire layer stack for implementation, et cetera.  The fuse data contains compressed information that is decompressed by decompressor 14 to'produce the control data for repairing or customizing fuse-programmable macros 16.  Shift registers 18 within the macros are arranged in chains to allow serial clocking of decompressed control data received from decompressor 14, so that at initialization, the control data is propagated to fuse-programmable macros 16.  After initialization, the functional logic implemented by fuse-programmable macros 16 will be configured for operation of integrated circuit 10.<br>
It should be understood that the implementation of integrated circuit 10 is not restricted to a single fusebox 11 coupled to a single chain of shift registers 18, but that the techniques of the present invention allow, for a design having multiple fuseboxes coupled to multiple shift register chains.  Alternatives include a single fusebox coupled to multiple shift register chains with parallel data output from the fusebox to supply each of the chains.  Choice of a particular design implementation is made on the basis of macro placement within the integrated circuit, and the initialization time period that is permissible. As the number of shift registers holding control data received from fusebox 11 increases, the amount time required to initialize integrated circuit 10 correspondingly increases.  For applications wherein integrated circuit 10 is<br><br>
power-cycled frequently, or must initialize rapidly such as personal digital assistant (PDA) applications, it may be desirable to implement a quantity of shift register chains fed in parallel by one fusebox or individually by several fuseboxes.<br>
Referring now to Figure 2, a detailed block diagram of fusebox 11 of Figure 1 is shown.  Power-on reset is a signal that may be externally supplied or internally generated within integrated circuit 10.  Power-on reset indicates that integrated circuit 10 should be initialized for operation.  Power-on reset is combined in an AND gate 21 with a disable signal produced by decompressor 25.  Counter 23 is held in a reset state until power-on reset is asserted.  The state of decompressor 25 is also held in a reset state until power-on reset is asserted.  The output of AND gate 21 enables a ring oscillator 22 that operates decompressor 25. When enabled by the count enable signal from decompressor 25, ring oscillator 22 operates the counter until decompressor 25 sets the clock enable signal to the negative state, disabling ring oscillator 22.  Thus, counter 23 begins to count when power-on reset is activated and stop when decompressor 25 clock enable output indicates decompression is complete.  Counter 23 is prevented from counting until power-on reset is activated.  The outputs of counter 23 select rows within fusebox 24, retrieving two compressed control data words that are coupled to decompressor 25.<br><br>
Decompressor 25 is a state machine that decompresses the two compressed control data words according to a mode select encoded in the first two words of fuse array 24 (selected by counter value zero).  The control word contains information in addition to the mode select bits, such as the specific data width of fuse array 24 and the length of the decompressed control data shift register. Encoding the length of the decompressed control data shift register in the first two fuse array 24 words provides the state machine with information about the number of shift cycles that need to occur in order to fill the decompressed control data shift register chain. Encoding the width of fuse array 24 permits the same state machine design to be used with fuse arrays of differing data widths.  This is desirable in that differing integrated circuit designs will have differing fuse layout ground rule requirements.  It is generally desirable to minimize the quantity of fuses placed on the die, so the ability to vary the length and width of the data without designing a custom decompressor is a preferred feature for custom logic implementations.<br>
A row within fuse array 24 contains two fuse words. In practice, half of the row data, or one fuse word, in fuse array 24 is reversed in a mirror-image, so that the outermost bits of the fuse array can be physically absent from the fuse array design and ignored by decompressor 25 when a smaller fuse array is implemented.<br>
The decompression schemes implemented by<br><br>
decompressor 25 are mode selectable by the control word loaded from the first location in fuse array 24.  The modes supported are: image mode, in which the control data is shifted out without modification (no compression), run-length mode (RLL) in which zeros are shifted out for control data words in which a zero count is encoded, and variable mode in which one of the control data word bits indicates a fixed value (zero or one) to shift out for the count encoded in the control data word. Able 1 shows the format of the control word and data words encoded in fuse array 24.<br><br>
The second row of Table 1 shows the organization of the control word in the first location of fuse array 24-<br><br>
The lower half of the word has been bit reversed and the outer bits are unused (N/A) to accomodate fuse arrays 24 of 22 bit width. Ml and MO encode the mode, with 0 indicating shift all zeros (no fuses bloom), Mode 1 indicates RLL decompression mode, and Mode 2 image mode (no compression).  EV=0 indicates that the mode 1 RLL value to shift is zero, FV=1 indicates that bit 1 of an RLL encoding control data word will determine the fixed value to shift for a run-  L16-L0 encode the total number of bits to be shifted (data length) allowing for 128K bits to be shifted from the decompressor.<br>
The third row of Table 1 show the significance of<br>
the control data word bits when M0DE=1 and EV=0.  Each<br>
location holds two control data words, with the lower<br>
word reversed in bit order so that smaller fuse arrays<br>
may be used.  RLL indicates whether or not the control<br>
data word half encodes a run (1) or an image (0), the<br>
balance of the word encodes image data or the run-length<br>
count from least significant bit (LSB) to<br>
most-significant bit (MSB).  For a 22-bit control data<br>
word size, the MSB values are ignored.  The fourth row of<br>
Table 1 shows the significance of the control data word<br>
bits when M0DE=1 and FV=1. VAL is the fixed value to<br>
the image data.  If M0DE=2, there is no compression, so<br>
all of the bits in the control data words are image bits.<br>
Referring now to Figure 3, shift registers 18 of Figgie 1 are depicted in detail.  The entry point for<br><br>
decompressed control data is .a full level-sensitive scan design (LSSD) latch 31.  This forms the first bit in the shift register, and provides compatibility between the LSSD design of integrated circuit 10 and fusebox 11 operation. Since the control data decompressed from fuses 12 must be maintained after initialization and during system level testing, the scan clocking of the shift registers 18 must be deselected.  FUSE BYPASS disables the scan clock ACLK during system level scan operations, providing that scan clocks produced during system level testing do not propagate to shift registers 18 and corrupt the decompressed control data shift register values.  The gated clock is combined in OR gate 34 with FUSE CCLK output from fusebox 11 which shifts the decompressed control data to shift registers 18. Control data is maintained in full LSSD latch 31 and scan-only latches 33.  Since the FUSE BYPASS disables ACLK to scan only latches 33, shift clock B does not have to be modified to prevent system level testing from clocking out the control data. FUSE BYPASS also controls data selector 35, so that when system level testing is performed using LSSD scan clocks, the SCANZN is coupled to SCAHOUT, thereby bypassing shift register 18, allowing other latches within the same chip-level LSSD scan chain to be tested.<br>
Referring now to Figure 4, clock circuits within decompressor 25 and ring oscillator 22 of Figure 2 are<br>
shown in detail.  In this circuit, delay elements provide a feedback signal to AND gate 42, which produces an input<br><br>
to master-slave latch pair 44.  Master-slave latch pair 44 is held in transparent mode while integrated circuit 10 is initializing, in order to allow a feedback path for the ring oscillator two-phase clock generator.  The two-phase clock is provided as input to clock choppers 43A and 43B which generate a two non-overlapping clock pulses ZC and ZB that are used for shifting the decompressed control data to shift registers 18.  Signals CI and B are used to clock the clock choppers 43A and 43B while integrated circuit 10 is operated by the manufacturing tester.<br>
.RESET is a stretched and inverted version of power-on reset signal POR, used by other circuits within integrated circuit 10 to ensure that reset is valid after clocking from clock chippers 43A and 43B has ceased and the decompressed control data has been loaded into shift registers 18.<br>
Referring now to Figure 5, fuse array 24 of Figure 2<br>
is depicted in detail.  Fuses 51 are arranged in rows of pairs, with one contact of each fuse coupled to ground and the other contact of each fuse coupled to a select transistor 52 and a clamp transistor 54.  Select transistor 52 is enabled by a decoder 53.  Clamp transistor 54 is disabled by decoder 53. A matrix arrangement of fuses is an efficient arrangement for reading the fuse data into decompressor 11.  The selection of word lines from fuse array 24 only during a read operation ensures that clamp device 54 will hold the<br><br>
personalized end of the fuse to ground.  Clamp device 54 ensures that a static potential will not be present on fuses 51 during operation of integrated circuit 10 after initialization, minimizing the chance that regret of a blown fuse will occur.<br>
Referring now to Figure 6, a method for initializing an integrated circuit using compressed data from a remote fusebox in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the invention is depicted. A control word is read from fuse array 24 that includes word size, decompression mode and data length (step 60) if the data length is zero (decision 61), the decompressor 14 is done.  Otherwise, the next compressed control data word is read from fuse array 24 and the data length number is decremented (step 62).  If the control data word encodes an image or the compression mode is absolute mode (no compression) (decision 63), the image bits are shifted out according to the word size (step 64).  Otherwise, if the RLL compression mode is variable (step 66), the fixed value determined by the type of run encoded (1 or 0) is shifted out according to the length encoded in the control data word (step 68)•  If the RLL compression mode is not variable (decision 66), zeros are shifted out according to the run length encoded in the control data word (step 67). After the appropriate shifting operation is performed, the data length is decremented (step 65) and the decompressor 14 repeats operation until the data length value is zero (decision 61).<br><br>
Referring now to Figure 7/ a multi-chip module 70 in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention is depicted- When several dies 71 having fuse programmable macros are incorporated within multi-chip module 70, a common fuse die 72 is used to supply control data to the fuse data shift registers within each die 71. This permits very efficient layout of non-fuse dies 71, but generally requires more complex scan controls within fuse die 72, along with selection logic for selecting individual dies 71 to receive control data from the fuses. Another efficiency of this scheme is for repair applications, dies not needing fuse correction free the fuses for use in repairing faults on other dies, maximizing the use of the fuses.<br>
