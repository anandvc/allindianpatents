				<td>MUSCARINIC AGONIST   COMPOUNDS Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to compounds that affect cholinergic receptors, especially muscarinic receptors. The present invention provides compounds that are agonists of cholinergic receptors including muscarinic receptors, especially the ml and m4 subtype of muscarinic receptors. The invention also provides methods of using the provided compounds for modulating conditions associated with cholinergic receptors, especially for treating or alleviating disease conditions associated with muscarinic receptors, e.g., m1 or m.4 subtypes of receptors.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Muscarinic cholinergic receptors mediate the actions of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine in the central and peripheral-nerrvous-systemsrgastrointestinal-system,heart. endocrine glands, lungs, and other tissues. Muscarinic receptors, play a central role in the central nervous system for higher-cognitive functions, as well as in the peripheral parasympathetic nervous system. Five distinct muscarinic receptor subtypes have been identified, ml-m5. The ml subtype is the predominant subtype found in the cerebral cortex and is believed to be involved in the control of cognitive functions; m2 is the predominant subtype found in heart and is believed to be involved in the control of heart rate; m3 is believed to be involved in gastrointestinal and urinary tract stimulation as well as sweating and salivation; m4 is present in brain and may be involved in locomotion; and m5, present in brain, may be involved in certain functions of the central nervous system associated with the dopaminergic system.<br>
Conditions associated with cognitive impairment, such as Alzheimer's disease, are accompanied by loss of acetylcholine in the brain. This is believed to be the result of degeneration of cholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain, which innervate areas of the association cortex,and hippocampus, which is involved in higher processes.<br>
Efforts to increase acetylcholine levels have focused on increasing levels of choline, the precursor for acetylcholine synthesis, and on blocking acetylcholine esterase (AChE), the enzyme that metabolizes acetylchohne. Administration of choline or phosphatidylcholine has not been very successful. AChE.inhibitors have shown some therapeutic efficacy, but may cause cholinergic side effects due to peripheral acetylcholine stimulation, including abdominal cramps, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, anorexia, weight loss, myopathy and<br>
1<br><br>
depression. Gastrointestinal side effects; have been observed in about a third of the patients treated. In addition, some AChE inhibitors, such as tacrine, have also been found to cause significant hepatotoxicity, with elevated liver transaminases observed in about 30% of patients. The adverse effects of AChE inhibitors have limited their clinical utility.<br>
Known ml muscarinic agonists such as arecoline have also been found to be weak agonists of m2 as well as rn3 subtype and are not very effective in treating cognitive impairment, most likely because of dose-limiting side effects.<br>
There is a need for compounds that increase acetylcholine signaling or effect in the brain. Specifically there is a need for muscarinic agonists that are active at various muscarinic receptor subtypes in the central and peripheral nervous system. Furthermore, there is a need for more highly selective muscarinic agonists, such as nil- or m4-selective agents, both as pharmacological tools and as therapeutic, agents.<br>

The present invention further provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising an effective amount of at least one compound of the invention, inclusive of all compounds within the scope of formula (I).<br>
In general, compounds of the present invention are active at cholinergic, specifically muscarinic receptors. Preferred compounds share the common property of acting as agonists at the ml or m4 muscarinic receptor subtypes, or both. In a preferred embodiment, the compounds of the present invention iire selective towards the ml, m4, or both the ml and m4 Subtypes of muscarinic receptors, i.e., the compounds have less or substantially no effect on other subtypes of the muscarinic receptors. Typically, the ml and/or m4 selective compounds of the invention have no effect on other, related receptors, including G-protein Coupled receptors, e.g., serotonin, histamine, dopamine or adrenergic receptors. The<br>
16<br><br>
invention provides compounds that are selective as agonists at either the ml or the m4 subtype as well as compounds that are agonists at both the ml and m4 receptor subtypes. In one embodiment, the compounds of the present invention have less or substantially no effect on m2 and m3 subtypes of muscarinic receptors. In another embodiment, the compounds of the present invention have less or substantially no effect on m2, m3, m4, and m5 subtypes of muscarinic receptors.<br>
The compounds of present invention typically have therapeutic effects and can be used to treat or alleviate symptoms of disease conditions associated with cholinergic receptors such as cognitive impairment, forgetfulness, confusion, memory loss, attentional deficits, deficits in visual perception, depression, pain, sleep disorders, psychosis, hallucinations, aggressiveness, paranoia, and increased intraocular pressure. The disease condition may result from dysfunction, decreased activity, modification, mutation, truncation, or loss of cholinergic receptors, especially muscarinic receptors, as well as from reduced levels of acetylcholine.<br>
The compounds of present invention can- also.be.used to treat diseases, e.g., age-related cognitive decline, Alzheimer's disease, Paridiison's disease,Huntingtonlsxhorea, Friederich's ataxia, Gilles de la Tourette's Syndrome, Down Syndrome, Pick disease, dementia, clinical depression, age-related cognitive decline, attention-deficit disorder, sudden infant death syndrome, and glaucoma.<br>
The compounds of the present invention have the ability to increase cholinergic receptor activity or activate cholinergic receptors. Cholinergic receptor activity includes signaling activity or any other activity that is directly or indirectly related to cholinergic signaling or activation. The cholinergic receptors include muscarinic receptors, especially the ml or m4 subtype of muscarinic receptors. The muscarinic receptor can be, for example, in the central nervous system, peripheral nervous system, gastrointestinal system, heart, endocrine glands, or lungs. The muscarinic receptor can be a wild-type, truncated, mutated, or modified cholinergic receptor. Kits comprising the compounds of the present invention for increasing cholinergic receptor activity or activating cholinergic receptors are also contemplated by the present invention.<br>
The system containing the cholinergic receptor may, for example, be a subject such as a mammal, non-human primate or_a_human. The system may also be an in vivo or in vitro experimental model, such as a cell culture model system that expresses a cholinergic receptor, a cell-free extract thereof that contains a cholinergic receptor, or a purified receptor. Non-limiting examples of such systems are tissue culture cells expressing the receptor, or<br>
17<br><br>
extracts or lysates thereof. Cells that may be used in the present method include any cells capable of mediating signal transduction via cholinergic receptors, expecially the ml muscarinic receptor, either via endogenous expression of this receptor (certain types of neuronal cells lines, for example, natively express the ml receptor), or such as following introduction of the an exogenous gene into the cell, for example, by transfection of cells with plasmids containing the receptor gene. Such cells are typically mammalian cells (or other eukaryolic cells, such as insect cells or Xenopus oocytes), because cells of lower life forms generally lack the appropriate signal transduction pathways for the present purpose. Examples of suitable cells include: Ihe mouse fibroblast cell line NIH 3T3 (ATCC CRL 1658), which responds to transfected ml receptors by increased growth; RAT 1 cells (Pace et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88:7031-35 (1991)); and pituitary cells (Vallar et ah, Nature 330:556-58 (1987)). Other useful mammalian cells for the present method include but are not limited to HEK 293 cells, CHO cells and COS cells.<br>
The compounds of the present invention also have the ability to reduce intraocular pressure and therefore can be used in the treatment of such diseases as glaucoma. Glaucoma is a disease in which an abnormality is observed in the circulation-control mechanism of the aqueous humor filling up the anterior chamber, i.e., the space formed between the cornea and the lens. This leads to an increase in the volume of the aqueous humor and an increase in intraocular pressure, consequently leading to visual field defects and even to loss of eyesight due to the compulsion and contraction of the papillae of the optic nerve.<br>
The present invention also pertains to the field of predictive medicine in which pharmacogenomics is used for prognostic (predictive) purposes. Pharmacogenomics deals with clinically significant hereditary variations in the response to drugs due to altered drug disposition and abnormal action in affected persons (see e.g., Eichelbaum, Clin Exp Pharmacol Physiol, 23:983-985 (1996) and Linder, Clin. Chem. 43:254-66 (1997)). In general, two types of pharmacogenetic conditions can be differentiated: genetic conditions transmitted as a single factor altering the way drugs act on the body (altered drug action) or genetic conditions transmitted as single factors altering the way the body acts on drugs (altered drug metabolism). These pharmacogenetic conditions can occur as naturally-occurring polymorphisms.<br>
One pharmacogenomics approach to identifying genes that predict drug response, known as "a genome-wide association", relies primarily on a high-resolution map of the human genome consisting of known gene-related markers (e.g., a "bi-allelic" gene marker map that consists of 60,000-100,000 polymorphic or variable sites on the human genome,<br>
18<br><br>
each of which has two variants). Such a high-resolution genetic map can be compared to a map of the genome of each of a statistically significant number of patients taking part in a Phase H/m drug trial to identify markers associated with a particular observed drug response or side effect. Alternatively, such a high resolution map can be generated from a combination of some ten-million known single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the human genome. As used herein, a "SNP" is a common alteration that occurs in a single nucleotide base in a stretch of DNA. For example, a SNP may occur once per every 1,000 bases of DNA. A SNP may be involved in a disease process although the vast majority may not be disease-associated. Given a genetic map based on the occurrence of such SNPs, individuals can be grouped into genetic categories depending on a particular pattern of SNPs in their individual genome. In such a manner, treatment regimens can be tailored to groups of genetically similar individuals, taking into account traits that may be common among such genetically similar individuals.<br>
Alternatively, a method termed the "candidate gene approach" can be utilized to identify genes that predict drug response. According to this method, if a 'gene-that encodes a_ drag's target is known (e.g., a protein or a receptor of the present invention), all common variants of that gene can be identi|ied in the population. It can be readily determined by standard techniques a particular version of the gene is associated with a particular drug response.<br>
Alternatively, a method termed "gene expression profiling" can be utilized to identify genes that predict drug response. For example, the gene expression of an animal dosed with a drug (e.g., a compound or composition of the present invention) can give an indication whether gene pathways related to toxicity have been turned on.<br>
Information generated from more than one of the above pharmacogenomics approaches can be used to determine appropriate dosage and treatment regimens for prophylactic or therapeutic treatment of an individual. This knowledge, when applied to dosing or drug selection, can avoid adverse reactions or therapeutic failure and thus enhance therapeutic or prophylactic efficiency when treating a subject with a compound or composition of the invention, such as a modulator identified by one of the exemplary screening assays described herein. These approaches can also be used to identify novel candidate receptor or other genes suitable for further pharmacological characterization in vitro and in vivo.<br>
Accordingly, another aspect of the present invention features methods and kits for identifying a genetic polymorphism predisposing a subject to being responsive to a<br>
19<br><br>
compound described herein. The method comprises administering to a subject an effective amount of a compound; identifying a responsive subject having an ameliorated disease condition associated with a cholinergic receptor; and identifying a genetic polymorphism in the responsive subject, wherein the genetic polymorphism predisposes a subject to being responsive to the compound. Identifying a genetic polymorphism in the responsive subject can be performed by any means known in the art including the methods discussed above. Jh addition, a kit to be used for identifying a genetic polymorphism predisposing a subject to being responsive to a compound provided in the present invention comprises the compound of the present invention, and preferably reagents and instructions for performing a genetic polymorphism test.<br>
In one embodiment, a subject can be tested for a known polymorphism that predisposes the subject to being responsive to the compound of the present invention. The presence of the polymorphism indicates that the subject is suitable for treatment.<br>

The compounds may also be resolved by formation of diastereomeric esters or amides, followed by chromatographic separation and removal of the chiral auxiliary.<br>
During any of the processes for preparation of the compounds of the present invention, it may be necessary and/or desirable to protect sensitive or reactive groups on any<br>
26<br><br>
of the molecules concerned. This may be achieved by means of conventional protecting groups, such as those described in Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry (McOmie ed., Plenum Press, 1973); and Greene &amp; Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis (John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1991) The protecting groups may be removed at a convenient subsequent stage using methods known from the art.<br>
Compounds of the present invention may be administered in any of the foregoing compositions and according to dosage regimens established in the art whenever specific pharmacological modification of the activity of muscarinic receptors is required.<br>
The present invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising one or more compounds of the invention together with a phannaceutically acceptable diluent or excipient. Preferably such compositions are in unit dosage forms such as tablets, pills, capsules (including sustained-release ordelayed-release formulations), powders, granules, elixirs, tinctures, syrups and emulsions, sterile parenteral solutions or suspensions, aerosol or liquid sprays, drops, ampoules, auto-injector devices or suppositories; for oral, parenteral {e.g., intravenous, intramuscular or subcutaneous), intranasal, sublingual or rectal administration, or for administration by inhalation or insufflation, and may be formulated in an appropriate manner and in accordance with accepted practices such as those disclosed in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences (Gennaro, ed., Mack Publishing Co., Easton PA, 1990). Alternatively, the compositions may be in sustained-release form suitable for once-weekly or once-monthly administration; for example, an insoluble salt of the active compound, such as the decanoate salt, may be adapted to provide a depot preparation for intramuscular injection^ The present invention also contemplates providing suitable topical formulations for administration to, e.g., eye, skin or mucosa.<br>
For instance, for oral administration in the form of a tablet or capsule, the active drug component can be combined with an oral, non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable inert carrier such as ethanol, glycerol, water and the like. Moreover, when desired or necessary, suitable binders, lubricants, disintegrating agents, flavoring agents and coloring agents can also be incorporated into the mixture. Suitable binders include, without limitation, starch, gelatin, natural sugars such as glucose or beta-lactose, natural and synthetic gums such as acacia, tragacanth or sodium alginate, carboxymethylcellulose, polyethylene glycol, waxes and the like.

27<br><br>
For preparing solid compositions such as tablets, the active ingredient is mixed with a suitable pharmaceutical excipient, e.g., such as the ones described above, and other pharmaceutical diluents, e.g,, water, to form a solid preformulation composition containing a homogeneous mixture of a compound of the present invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. By the term "homogeneous" is meant that the active ingredient is dispersed evenly throughout the composition so that the composition may be readily subdivided into equally effective unit dosage forms such as tablets, pills and capsules. The solid preformulation composition may then be subdivided into unit dosage forms of the type described above containing from about 0.01 to about 50 mg of the active ingredient of the present invention. The tablets or pills of the present composition may be coated or otherwise compounded to provide a dosage foim affording the advantage of prolonged action. For example, the tablet or pill can comprise an inner core containing the active compound arid an outer layer as a coating surrounding the core. The outer coating may be an enteric layer, which serves to resist disintegration in the stomach and permits the inner core to pass intact into the duodenum or to be delayed in release. A variety of materials can be used for such enteric layers or coatings, such materials including a number of polymeric acids and mixtures of polymeric acids with conventional materials such as shellac, cetyl alcohol and cellulose acetate.<br>
The liquid forms in which the; present compositions may be incorporated for administration orally or by injection include aqueous solutions, suitably flavored syrups, aqueous or oil suspensions, and flavored emulsions with edible oils such as cottonseed oil, sesame oil, coconut qiTor peanut oil, as well as elixirs and similar pharmaceutical carriers. Suitable dispersing Or suspending agents for aqueous suspensions include synthetic and natural gums such as tragacanth, acacia, alginate, dextran, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, gelatin, methylcellulose or polyvinyl-pyrrolidone. Other dispersing agents, which may be employed, include glycerin and the like. Forparenteral administration, sterile suspensions and solutions are desired. Isotonic preparations, which generally contain suitable preservatives, are employed when intravenous administration is desired. The compositions can also be formulated as an ophthaboic solution or suspension formation, i.e.., eye drops, for ocular administration<br>
Compounds of the present invention may be administered in a single daily dose, or the total daily dosage may be administered in divided doses two, three or four times daily. Furthermore, compounds of the present invention may be administered in intranasal form via topical use of suitable intranasal vehicles or via transdermal routes, using e.g., forms of<br>
28<br><br>
transdennal skin patches that are well known to persons skilled in the art. To be administered in the form of a transdennal delivery system, the dosage administration will be continuous rather than intermittent throughout the dosage regimen.<br>
The dosage regimen utilizing the compounds of the present invention is selected in accordance with a variety of factors including type, species, age, weight, sex and medical condition of the patient; the severity of the condition to be treated; the route of administration; the renal and hepatic function of the patient; and the particular compound employed. A physician or veterinarian of ordinary skill can readily determine and prescribe the effective amount of the drug required to prevent, counter or arrest the progress of the disease or disorder, which is being treated.<br>
The daily dosage of the products may be varied over a wide range from 0.01 to 100 mg per adult human per day. For oral administration, the compositions are preferably provided in the form of tablets containing 0.01, 0.05,0.1, 0.5,1.0,2.5, 5.0,10.0,15.0, 25.0 or 50.0 mg of the active ingredient for the symptomatic adjustment of the dosage to the patient to be treated. A unit dose typically contains from about 0.001 mg to about 50 mg of the active ingredient, preferably from about 1 mg to about 10 mg of active ingredient. An effective amount of the drug is ordinarily supplied at a dosage level of from about 0.0001 mg/kg to about 25 mg/kg of body weight per day. Preferably, the range is from about 0.001 to 10 mg/kg of body weight per day, and especially from about 0.001 mg/kg to 1 mg/kg of body weight per day. The compounds may be administered, for example, on a regimen of 1 to 4. times per day.<br>
Compounds according to the present invention may be used alone at appropriate dosages defined by routine testing in order to obtain optimal pharmacological effect on a muscarinic receptor, in particular the muscarinic ml or m4 receptor subtype, while rninimizing any potential toxic or otherwise unwanted effects. In addition, co-administration or sequential administration of other agents that improve the effect of the compound may, in some cases, be desirable.<br>
The pharmacological properties and the selectivity of the compounds of this invention for specific muscarinic receptor subtypes may be demonstrated by a number of different assay methods using, for example, recombinant receptor subtypes, preferably of the human receptors as available, e.g., conventional second messenger or binding assays. A particularly convenient functional assay system is the receptor selection and amplification assay disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,707,798, which describes a method of screening forbioactive compounds by utilizing the ability of cells transfected with receptor DNA, e.g., coding for the<br>
29<br><br>
different muscarinic subtypes, to amplify in the presence of a ligand of the receptor. Cell amplification is detected as increased levels of a marker also expressed by the cells.<br>
