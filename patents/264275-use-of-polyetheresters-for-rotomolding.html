Use of Polvetheresters for Rotomoldinq<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to the use in rotomolding or in slush molding applications of a polyolefin composition comprising a processing aid and optionally a UV-stabilizer. The polyolefin composition can also be used for the production of articles by other processes such as injection molding, cast film, blown film, calendering, sheet.extrusion.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
The present invention primarily concerns the fabrication of articles by rotomolding, also called rotational molding. In rotomolding a premeasured amount of polymer is placed in one half of the mold, the mold is closed and then heated until the polymer is molten. The mold is rotated so as to get good distribution of the polymer in the mold. The mold can be rotated either uniaxially or biaxially, but biaxial rotation is widely preferred, i.e. simultaneous rotation around two perpendicular axes. In the following the mold is cooled, opened and the formed article Is removed from the mold. Rotomolding can also be used for multilayer molding, for example by using more than one polymer sequentially. Rotomolding allows the production of hollow articles with good wall thickness distribution and good mechanical properties.<br>
Slush molding is a process that is closely related to rotomolding. In the following the term rotomolding is therefore used to imply both, rotomolding and slush molding applications.<br><br>
WO 2005/118709	PCT/EP2005/052460<br>
2<br>
The most widely used polymer In rotamolding is polyethylene. Therefore a lot of offort has been invested to improve the processabillty of polyethylene in rotomolding.<br>
US 6,362,270 discloses polymer compositions particularly suited for rotomolding. These polymer compositions comprise of at least 94 % by weight of one or more thermoplastic polymers and a maximum of 6 % by weight of one or more processing additives. The thermoplastic polymer may be selected from copolymers of ethylene and styrene, etnylene and/or C3-C20 alpha-olefin homo- or copolymers, nylon, polyethylene terephthalate, polycarbonate, acrylic polymer, polystyrene, and blends of those polymers. Suitable processing additives include aromatic or aliphatic hydrocarbon oils. esters, amides, alcohols, acids, and their organic or inorganic salts as well as silicone oils, polyether polyole, grycerol monostearate (GMS), pentaerytntol monooleate, erucamide, stearamides, adipic acid, sebacic acid, styrene-alpha-methyl-styrene, calcium stearata, zinc stoarate, phthalates and blends thereof. The processing additive preferably decreases the composition's melt viscosity and/or elasticity at zero or low shear rates to allow for a reduction in sintering time, cycle time and/or maximum mold temperature.<br>
A recent report (LT. Pick, E. Harkin-Jones, Third Polymer Processing Symposium, 28-29.01.2004, Belfast, p. 259-268) shows a correlation between the number of bubbles in a rotomolded article and its impact performance, with a higher number of bubbles resulting in lower impact performance. In addition, a high number of bubbles has a negative influence on the optical properties of the finished articles.<br>
There Is thus a need to provide a rotomolded article with a reduced number of bubbles.<br>
There is also a need to provide a rotomoided article with improved optical properties.<br><br>

Detailed description of the Invention<br>
The densification aid comprises a polyotherester, optionally consisting essentially of a mixture of a polyetherester as major component with a minor component selected from the group consisting of polyether-block co-polyamide. thermoplastic polyurethane. polyethylene glycol and fluoropolymer.<br>
By major component it is meant that such a component makes up more than 50 % by weight. By minor component it is meant that such a component makes up loss than 50 % by weight.<br>
Polyether-block co-polyamides are represented by the general formula HO-[C(O)-PA-C(O)-O-PEth-O)n-H (I)<br>
wherein PA represents the polyamide segment end PEth the polyether segment. For example the polyamide segment can be a PA 6, PA 66. PA 11 or a PA 12. Tho polyether segment can for example be a polyethylene glycol (PEG) of a polypropylene glycol (PPG) or a porytetrarnethylenglycol (PTMG). The molecular weight Mn of the polyamide sequence Is usually between 300 and 15,000. The molecular weight Mn of the polyether sequence is usually between 100 and 6000. Such materials are commercially available for example from Atofina under the Pebax® trade name.<br><br>

The copolymers having polyammide blocks and polyether blocks are generally obtained from the polycondensation of polyamide blocks having reactive end groups with polyether blocks having reactive end groups, such as. inter alia:<br>
1)	polyamide blocks having diamine chain ends with polyoxyalkylene<br>
blocks having dicarboxylic chain ends,<br>
2)	potyamide blocks having dicarboxylic chain ends with<br>
polyoxyalkytene bkxks having diamine chain ends, obtained by<br>
cyanoethylation and hydrogenation of aliphatic dihydroxylated<br>
a1,?-polyoxyalkylene bloks called polyetherdiols; and<br>
3)	potyamid bloks having dicarboxylic chain ends with polyothordiols,<br>
the products obtained being, in this particular case, polyothoresteramides.<br>
The polyammide bloks having dicarboxylic chain ends dorive, for example, from tho condensation of polyamide precursors In the presence of a chain-stopping carboxylic diacid.<br>
The polyamide bloks having diamino chain ends derive, for example, from the condensation of potyamide precursors in the presence of a chain-stop ping diacid.<br>
The polymers having polyamido bloks and polyether bloks may also include randomly distributed units. These polymers may by prepared by the simultaneous reaction of tho polyether and of the precursors of the polyamide bkxks.<br>
For example, a polyetherdiol, polyamide precursors and a chain-stopping diacid may be made to react together. A polymer is obtained which essentially has polyether blocks and polyamide bloks of very variable length, but in addition the various reactants that have reacted randomly, which are distributed in a random fashion along tho polymer chain.<br><br>
WO 2005/118709	PCT/EP2005/05I46O<br>

A poLyether diamine, polyamide precursors and a chain-stopping diacid may also be made to react together. A polymer is obtained which has essentially polyether blocks and polyamide blocks of very variable length, but also the various reactants that have reacted randomly, which are distributed in a random fashion along the polymer chain.<br>
The amount of polyether blocks in these copolymers having polyamide blocks and polyether blocks is advantageously from 10 to 70% and preferably from 35 to 60% by weight of the copolymer.<br>
The polyetherdiol blocks may either be used as such and copotycondensed with polyamide blocks having carboxylic end groups, or they may be aminated in order to be converted into polyetherdiamines and condensed with polyamide blocks having carboxylic end groups. They may also be blended with polyamide precursors and a diacid chain stopper in order to make the polymers having polyamide blocks and polyether blocks with randomly distributed units.<br>
The number-average molar mass Mn of the polyamide blocks is usually between 300 and 15,000, except in the case of the polyamide blocks of the second type. The mass Mn of the polyether blocks is usually between 100 and 6000.<br>
As regards tho polyetheresters, those are copolymers having polyester blocks and polyether blocks. They generally consist of soft polyether blocks, which are the residues of potyetherdiois, and of hard segments (polyester blocks), which usualy result from the reaction of at least one dicarboxyfic acid with at least one chain-extending short diol unit The polyester blocks and the polyether blocks are generally Iinked by ester linkages resulting from the reaction of the add functional groups of the acid with the OH functional groups of the polyetherdiol. The short chain-extending diol may be chosen from the group consisting of neopentyl glycol, cycloexanedimethanol and<br><br>

8<br>
aliphatic glycols of formula HO(CH2)nOH In which n is an integer varying from 2 to 10. Advantageously, the diacids are aromatic dicarboxylic: acids having from 8 to 14 carbon atoms. Up to 50 mol% of the dlcarboxylic aromatic acid may be replaced with at least one other dicarboxylik; aromatic acid having from 8 to 14 carbon atoms, and/or up to 20 mol% may be replaced with a dicarboxylic aliphatic acid having from 2 to 12 carbon atoms.<br>
As examples of dicarboxylic aromatic acids, mention may be made of terephthalic. isophthalic. dibenzoic, naphthalenedicarboxylic acids, 4,4'-diphenylenedicarbaxylic acid, bts(p-carboxyphenyl)methane acid, ethylenebis(p-benzoic acid). 1,4-tetramethylenebis(p-oxybenzoic acid), ethylenebis(paraoxybenzoic acid) and 1,3-trimothylene bis(p-oxybenzoic acid). As examples of glycols, mention may be made of ethylene glycol, 1,3-trimethylene glycol, 1,4-tetramethylene glycol. 1,6-hexamethylene glycol. 1,3-propylene glycol, 1,8-octamethylene glycol, 1,10-decamethylene glycol and 1,4-cyclohexylenedimethanol. The copolymers having potyester blocks and polyether blocks are, for example, copolymers having polyether blocks derived from polyether diols, such as polyethylene glycol (PEG), polypropylene grycol (PPG) or polytetramethylene glycol (PTMG), dicarboxylic acid units, such as terephthalic acid, and glycol (ethanediol) or 1,4-butanediol units. The chain-linking of the poryethers and diacids forms soft segments while the chain-linking of the grycol or the butanediol with the diacids forms the hard segmonts of the copolyetherester. Such copolyetheresters are disclosed in patents EP 402 883 and EP 406 227. These polyetheresters are thermoplastic elastomers. They may contain plasticizors.<br>
Polyetherosters can for oxample bo obtained from Du Pont Company under tho HytreJ9 tradomark.<br>
As regards the potyurethanes, these in general consist of soft potyether blocks, which usualry aro residues of pofyet herd tots, and hard blocks<br><br>

Polyethylene glycols are commercially available in a wide range of molecular weights and viscosities. Depending upon their molecular weights polyethylene glycols can be liquid or solid. The polyethylene glycols used in the present invention usually have an average"-molecular weight from 100 to 2000 g/mol and more preferably from 150 to 700 g/mol. Suitable polyethylene glycols can for example be obtained from Dow Chemical Company or BASF under the Carbowax@and Pluriol E® trade names.<br>
The fluoropolymers suited as processing aid in the present invention are for example polymers of vinylidene fluoride (H2C=CF2) and/or copolymers of vinylidene fluoride and hexafluoropropyiene (F2OCF-CF3). Though the copolymers of vinylidene fluoride and hexafluoropropyiene do not have elastomeric properties they are commonly referred to as "fluoroelastomers". The content of the comonomer hexafluoropropyiene in a fluoroelastomer is usually in the range of 30 to 40 % by weight. Fluoropolymers suited as processing aids in the current invention are for example commercially<br><br>

The polyolofins erf tho present invention may also compete© other additfves such as for example antioxidants. acid scavongors, antistatic additives, fillers, slip additives or anti-oiocking additives.<br>
When a potyolefin composition is used as stalling material, the composition composes:<br>
• from 50 to 99 % by wotght of a first pofyotefin, preferably polyethylene; - from 1 to 50 % by weight of a second polymer, which is difforont from the processing aid, and which is preferably selected from the group consisting of polyamide, copolyamide, a second potyolefin different from the first one. copotymers of ethytene and vinyl acetate (EVA), copoJymers of ethytone and vinyl alcohol (EVOH), polystyrone, polycarbonate and potyvirtyl chloride (PVC).<br>
n is also possible to use a potyotefln comprising a densification aid as one or more layers of a muHJIayered rotomolded article with the other layers comprising a polymer preferably selected from the group consisting of polyamide, copofyamWe, a second potyolefln different from the first one, coporymors of ethytone and vinyf acetate (EVA), copotymers of ethytene and virryt alcohol (EVOH), polystyrene, polycarbonate and polyvfnyl chloride (PVC).<br>

Tho uso of a processing ak) according to tho present invention results in cycle time reductions of at toast 10 %, preferably by at least 20 %. In order to obtain the samo numbor of bubbles in the rotomokied articles the peak internal air temperature (RAT) can be reduced by at (east 10 degrees centigrade<br>
Even more surprisingly, n has been found that tho further addition of from 0 025 % by wotght to 0.500 % by weight of one or more UV-stabJIizors to tho composition described hereabove comprising 0.001 % by weight to 1 % by weight of a processing aid even further improves the processabHity of the potyotefin in rotomolding.<br>
It is believed that there Is a synergy between the processing ak) and the UV-stabillser, and it is thus preferred to use both.<br>
In rotomolding a promeasured amount of polymer Is placed in one half of the moid, tho mold Is dosed and then heated until the potyrr.er is molten. The mold is rotatod so as to get an even distribution of the potymer in the mold. The mold can be rotated eithoruniaxtaUy or biaxially, but biaxial rotation Is wkJefy preferred, i.o. simultaneous rotation around two perpendicular axes. In the foflowirtg step tho mold is cooled, opened and the formed article is removed from the mold.<br>
The rotomolding cycto comprises three main steps, each of which has an impact on cycle time and tho properties of the so-produced article. The three steps comprise:<br>
•	sintering or coalescence,<br>
•	densiflcatJon or bubble removal, and<br>
- crystallization.<br>

The present invention Is mostty concerned with the modification of the potymer behavior In tho sintering (coalescence) and densiflcation (bubble removal) phases of the rotomolding cycle and slush molding cycle. Sintering Is measured according to a method described for example by Bellehumeur et al (C.T. Beltehumour, M.K. Blsarta, J. Vtachopoutos, Polymer Engineering and Science, 36, 2198, 1996). Dertsification and bubble formation has been discu&amp;sod by Kontopouto ot a. (M. Kontopouk), E. Takacs, J. Vtachopoulos, Rotation, 28, January 2000). During metting air pockets or bubbles are trapped, thus delaying the formation of a homogeneous melt and also affecting tho aesthetJcaJ and/or mechanical properties of the finished product<br>
For the present Invention a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera was used to characterize the properties of potyoteftn powders during a rotomolding cyde or during sintering and/or denslfication simulations.<br><br>
