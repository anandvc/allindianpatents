				<td>COLD IONIZING RADIATION STERILIZATION<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001] This invention relates to polymer sterilization.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0002] A variety of polymers have been employed to make surgical implants and<br>
tissue sealants, or to perform surgical repairs and drug delivery. In order to satisfy patient<br>
safety considerations and meet regulatory requirements, medical products containing such<br>
polymers normally are sterilized at the manufacturing site.' A variety of sterilization<br>
techniques have been employed, including chemical treatments (e.g., ethylene oxide gas or<br>
hydrogen peroxide), heat (e.g., steam) and ionizing radiation (e.g., gamma radiation,<br>
ultraviolet light, X-ray or E-Beam processing).<br>
[0003] Medical products containing polysaccharides or other polymers may be<br>
provided to a medical professional in dry hydratable form (e.g., as a powder or sponge),<br>
and hydrated (e.g., rehydrated) to form a moist shapeable product (e.g., a cohesive gel or<br>
compressible sponge) for subsequent placement in a patient.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0004] In some cases a hydratable medical product is required to exhibit specific<br>
physical characteristics during or after hydration, or during or after patient placement For<br>
example, a hydratable gel-forming polymer may require one or more properties such as<br>
rapid, clump-free hydration; thixotropic behavior when sprayed or injected; high viscosity<br>
and cohesive gel character once in place; controllable biodegradation; resistance to<br>
premature biodegradation; or an ability to break down or be dislocated without producing<br>
large solid chunks. A hydratable sponge may require one or more properties such as<br>
tensile strength; resiliency; slow or rapid shape recovery after being compressed;<br>
controllable biodegradation; resistance to premature biodegradation; or an ability to break<br>
down or be dislocated without producing large solid chunks. These properties may be<br>
strongly influenced by the polymer molecular weight. Sterilization using ionizing<br>
radiation may cause significant polymer chain scission and a substantial reduction in<br>
molecular weight, with a consequent substantial change in polymer properties. The degree<br>
of polymer degradation may be especially severe when using gamma radiation<br>
sterilization, but appreciable degradation may also be observed when using other ionizing<br>
radiation sterilization techniques. Sterilization using steam or ethylene oxide (which<br>
typically is performed in the presence of water vapor) may hydrate the polymer and<br>
prematurely convert it to a gel form, thereby limiting or preventing subsequent rehydration<br>
at an intended time for product placement.<br>
[0005] The present invention provides, in one aspect, a method for polymer<br>
sterilization, which method comprises:<br>
a) providing a hydratable gel-forming polymer chilled below ambient temperature<br>
(e.g., chilled to a temperature below about 15° C); and<br>
b) sterilizing the chilled polymer using ionizing radiation to provide a sterile<br>
polymer.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the chilled polymer is sterilized using E-Beam radiation. The<br>
disclosed method can reduce polymer chain scission and physical property alteration<br>
compared to ionizing radiation sterilization of an ambient temperature polymer. The<br>
method is especially useful for maintaining acceptable physical properties for hydratable<br>
gel-forming polymers which will be sprayed onto a treatment site.<br>
[0006] The invention provides in another aspect a medical device comprising a sterile<br>
hydratable gel-forming polymer whose polydispersity index is greater than that of the<br>
polymer if unsterilized (viz., that of the polymer before sterilization), or whose weight<br>
average or number average molecular weight is greater than the respective weight average<br>
or number average molecular weight of the polymer if sterilized using ionizing radiation<br>
(e.g., using E-Beam radiation) while at ambient temperature.<br>
[0007] The invention provides in another aspect a treatment method, which method<br>
comprises hydrating the disclosed sterile hydratable gel-forming polymer to form a<br>
cohesive hydrogel, and injecting or spraying a layer of the cohesive hydrogel onto tissue<br>
(e.g., mucosal tissue) or other body structures.<br>

[0032] A wide variety of hydratable gel-forming polymers may be employed in the<br>
disclosed methods and medical devices. The polymer may be crosslinkable or<br>
uncrosslinkable, and one or all of the polymers in a mixture of polymers may be<br>
crosslinked. The polymer desirably is water soluble or may be rendered so, e.g., by<br>
suitable acidification. The polymer may be a liquid, gel or solid. If a liquid, the polymer<br>
desirably is crosslinkable and is combined with a suitable, crosslinking agent to bring about<br>
gel formation. If a solid, the polymer desirably is in particulate form to facilitate more<br>
rapid hydration and gel formation, e.g., as free-flowing granules whose average particle<br>
diameter is less than about 1 mm, less than about 100 µm, about 1 to about 80 µm, or less<br>
than 1 µm. The polymer may have a variety of molecular weights, e.g., a weight average<br>
molecular weight before sterilization of about 7 to about 3000 kDa, about 15 to about 750<br>
kDa, or about 15 to about 500 kDa and a number average molecular weight before<br>
sterilization of about 5 to about 2000 kDa, about 10 to about 500 kDa, or about 10 to about<br>
300 kDa.<br>
[0033] Compositions containing mixtures of polymers are especially desirable, as such<br>
compositions may enable formation of hydrogels and sponges whose properties could not<br>
be provided using a single polymer. For example, by altering the ratio of two polymers in<br>
a blend, the biodegradable or bioresorbable characteristics and residence time of the blend<br>
may be altered. A mixture of two polymers may for example contain about 99 to about 1<br>
% of a first polymer and about 1 to about 99 % of a second polymer, or about 80 to about<br>
20 % of the first polymer and about 20 to about 80 % of the second polymer, or about 60<br>
to about 40 % of the first polymer and about 40 to about 60 % of the second polymer.<br>
Through appropriate selection of the types and amounts of polymers in a mixture,<br>
rehydratable gels and sponges with tunable properties may be obtained.<br>
[0034] Exemplary polymers for use in the disclosed methods and medical devices<br>
include polyethylene glycols ("PEGs"), methoxypolyethylene glycols ("MPEGs") and<br>
other polyoxyethylenes; collagen and collagen derivatives including gelatin;<br>
polysaccharides and polysaccharide derivatives; hydratable polyurethanes and<br>
combinations thereof. Polyoxyethylenes and polysaccharides are especially desirable<br>
hydratable gel-forming polymers. Exemplary polyoxyethylenes include CARBOWAX™<br>
polyethylene glycols from Dow Chemical Company, the corresponding CARBOWAX<br>
SENTRY™ food and drug compliant polyethylene glycols also from Dow Chemical<br>
Company and other biocompatible polyoxyethylenes capable of providing a hydratable<br>
gel-forming polymer.<br>
[0035] Exemplary collagens and collagen derivatives are available from a variety of<br>
sources including processors of beef cattle and pigs. The disclosed medical device may be<br>
substantially collagen-free, and desirably is sufficiently free of collagen (e.g., containing<br>
no collagen at all) so as to be saleable worldwide for use without restriction in humans.<br>
[0036] Exemplary polysaccharides include agars, alginates, carrageenans, celluloses,<br>
chitins, chitosans, chondroitin sulfates, dextrans, galactomannans, glycogens, hyaluronic<br>
acids, starches and other biocompatible polysaccharides capable of providing a hydratable<br>
gel-forming polymer. Compositions containing carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) and<br>
chitosan may provide an especially desirable set of properties. Other desirable<br>
compositions include those containing chitosan together with an alginate, hyaluronic acid<br>
or chondroitin sulfate.<br>
[0037] Exemplary celluloses include CMC, methylcellulose, ethylcellulose,<br>
hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose and hemicellulose, as well as<br>
derivatives thereof including oxidized celluloses. Exemplary cellulosic materials may be<br>
obtained from a variety of commercial sources including Dow Wolff Cellulosics (e.g., the<br>
WALOCEL™ CRT line of sodium carboxymethylcellulose products), Hercules, Inc. (e.g.,<br>
the AQUALON™ line of cellulose gum and carboxymethylcellulose products) and Sigma-<br>
Aldrich Co. (e.g., No. C4021 microgranular cellulose).<br>
[0038] Exemplary unmodified chitosans and their salts (including citrate, nitrate,<br>
lactate, phosphate, chloride and glutamate salts) may be obtained from a variety of<br>
commercial sources including KitoZyme S.A., Fluka Chemie AG, the NovaMatrix unit of<br>
FMC BioPolymer AS and Sigma-Aldrich Co. Chitosan may also be synthesized by<br>
deacetylation of chitin (poly-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine) to eliminate acetyl groups on the<br>
nitrogen atom by hydrolysis. The resulting polymer has a plurality of repeating units (e.g.,<br>
about 30 to about 3000 repeating units, about 60 to about 600 repeating units, or such<br>
other amount as may be desired for the chosen end use) some or all of which contain<br>
deacetylated amino groups (e.g., about 30 to about 100% or about 60 to about 95% of the<br>
total repeating units), with the remaining repeating units (if any) containing acetylated<br>
amino groups. The polymer is cationic and may be regarded as being composed from<br>
glucosamine monomers. The chitosan may for example be an ultralow molecular weight<br>
material having a number average molecular weight before sterilization less than about 50<br>
kDa, a low molecular weight material having a number average molecular weight before<br>
sterilization of about 50 to about 200 kDa, a medium molecular weight material having a<br>
number average molecular weight before sterilization of about 200 to about 500 kDa or a<br>
high molecular weight material having a number average molecular weight before<br>
sterilization greater than about 500 kDa. Chitosan derivatives may also be employed, for<br>
example derivatives in which one or more hydroxyl or amino groups have been modified<br>
for the purpose of altering the solubility or mucoadhesion characteristics of the derivative.<br>
Exemplary derivatives include thiolated chitosans, and non-thiolated chitosan derivatives<br>
such as acetylated, alkylated or sulfonated chitosans (for example O-alkyl ethers, O-acyl<br>
esters, cationized trimethyl chitosans and chitosans modified with polyethylene glycol).<br>
Chitosan derivatives may be obtained from a variety of sources. For example, thiolated<br>
chitosans may be obtained from ThioMatrix Forschungs Beratungs GmbH and<br>
Mucobiomer Biotechnologische Forschungs-und Entwicklungs GmbH or prepared by<br>
reaction of chitosan with a suitable thiolated reactant, e.g., as described in Published PCT<br>
Application No. WO 03/020771 Al and in Roldo et al., Mucoadhesive thiolated chitosans<br>
as platforms for oral controlled drug delivery: synthesis and in vitro evaluation, European<br>

journal of Pharmaceutics, 317, 76-81 (2006).<br>
[0039] Sources for and types of other polysaccharides (e.g., agars, alginates,<br>
carrageenans, chitins, chondroitin sulfates, dextrans, galactomannans, glycogens,<br>
hyaluronic acids, starches) may be chosen by persons skilled in the art based on selection<br>
characteristics similar to those given above for celluloses and chitosans. When combined<br>
in a polysaccharide mixture, the amounts of each polysaccharide may be varied widely to<br>
attain a desired combination of properties. For example, a blend of CMC and chitosan<br>
may have good bacteriostatic performance due to the chitosan and controlled, sustained<br>
and tunable degradation rates due to the CMC, whereas chitosan used alone may form a<br>
gel or sponge having inherently poor mechanical and resorbtive properties and CMC used<br>
alone may form a gel or sponge lacking bactericidal properties.<br>
[0040] Exemplary hydratable polyurethanes include those described in U.S. Patent No.<br>
4,137,200, HYPOL™ hydrophilic polyurethane prepolymers (Dow Chemical Company,<br>
Midland Ml) and NASOPORE™ nasal dressing from Polyganics BV, Ro2enburglaan, The<br>
Netherlands).<br>
[0041] The polymer(s) optionally are crosslinked before being packaged and sent to<br>
end users. Crosslinking may for example be carried out using a dehydrothermal<br>
crosslinking process as described in copending PCT Application No. (Attorney Docket<br>
Nos. P0027228.02 and 151-P-27228WO01), filed even date herewith. For the disclosed<br>
rehydratable gel this preferably is done by dehydrothermally crosslinking a mass of free-<br>
flowing rehydratable polymer particles to form free-flowing rehydratable crosslinked<br>
polymer particles. In other words, the particles preferably are themselves individually<br>
crosslinked while still remaining free-flowing and capable of later rapid dissolution and<br>
rehydration. For the disclosed sponge, crosslinking preferably is done by<br>
dehydrothermally crosslinking a shaped porous article which has been made by placing a<br>
solution of the desired polymer in a suitable mold and lyophilizing the solution to form a<br>
porous solid having a shape corresponding to the desired uncompressed sponge shape. In<br>
other words, the sponge preferably is shaped and made porous prior to crosslinking.<br>
[0042] Crosslinking may also be performed using condensation reactions (e.g., a<br>
dehydration reaction leading to the loss of water, or a reaction leading to the loss of<br>
another small molecule such as hydrogen chloride, methanol or acetic acid), addition<br>
polymerization reactions (e.g. of vinyl groups), ionic reactions, or reactions involving<br>
sulfide or amine groups.<br>
[0043] When combinations of two or more polymers are employed, crosslinking may<br>
be performed on one or on more than one of the polymers before the polymers are<br>
blended. This permits customization of properties such as gelation behavior, gelation time<br>
and degradation time following implantation. If desired, the resulting blend may be<br>
subjected to an additional crosslinking reaction, e.g., a dehydrothermal crosslinking<br>
reaction. The polymers may also be kept separate and later mixed by an end user,<br>
although this will normally be less convenient than forming the blend at a manufacturing<br>
site.<br>
[0044] The disclosed hydratable gel-forming polymer is converted from an unsterile to<br>
a sterile form using cold ionizing radiation sterilization. The term "cold" refers in this<br>
context to the use of ionizing radiation to sterilize a polymer chilled below ambient<br>
temperature, and not to the use of ionizing radiation to sterilize a polymer at ambient<br>
temperature. It should be noted that E-Beam sterilization of polymers at ambient<br>
temperature is sometimes referred to in various publications as "cold" E-Beam<br>
sterilization to distinguish such sterilization from elevated temperature sterilization<br>
processes such as the use of steam or ethylene oxide. For the present application the term<br>
"cold E-Beam sterilization" will instead refer to the use of E-Beam radiation to sterilize a<br>
polymer chilled below ambient temperature.<br>
[0045] The polymer may be chilled in a variety of ways, including storage in a freezer,<br>
contact with a cold plate, exposure to chilled dry air, exposure to dry ice or exposure to<br>
liquefied anhydrous gas (e.g., liquid carbon dioxide or liquid nitrogen). The polymer may<br>
for example be chilled to a temperature (as measured in the interior of the polymer sample<br>
prior to E-Beam exposure) at or below 15° C, 10° C, 5° C, 0° C, -5° C, -10° C, -15° C, -<br>
20° C, or even colder, e.g., as may be attained by chilling to temperatures approaching or<br>
at the dry ice atmospheric pressure sublimation point (-79° C) or the liquid nitrogen<br>
atmospheric pressure boiling point (-196° C). The sterile polymer may experience less<br>
polymer chain scission than, an otherwise similar polymer sterilized using ionizing<br>
radiation while at ambient temperature. In general, as the chilled polymer temperature is<br>
reduced, the extent of polymer chain scission caused by ionizing radiation sterilization<br>
may likewise be reduced. Depending on the chosen sterilization technique, chilling may<br>
be carried out before and during sterilization or merely before sterilization. For a slower -<br>
sterilization technique such as gamma radiation sterilization, chilling generally will be<br>
needed both before and during sterilization. For a faster sterilization technique such as E-<br>
Beam processing, chilling merely before sterilization may suffice.<br>
[0046] A variety of ionizing radiation sterilization sources may be employed,<br>
including gamma radiation, ultraviolet light, X-rays and E-Beam radiation. E-Beam<br>
radiation is especially desirable due in part to the rapid rate at which it can be performed,<br>
with typical sterilization cycles usually being completed in a manner of minutes (e.g., two<br>
five minute cycles). X-rays may be preferred for applications where greater penetrating<br>
power than that provided by E-Beam radiation is required. Ultraviolet radiation and<br>
gamma radiation may also be employed, but may be contraindicated in some cases due in<br>
part to the higher degree of polymer degradation that ultraviolet or gamma radiation may<br>
cause and in the case of gamma radiation due to the much longer sterilization cycles (e.g.,<br>
several hours or more) which may be required.<br>
[0047] Cold E-Beam sterilization is as noted above especially desirable, and will be<br>
discussed below in greater detail. It should be understood that persons skilled in the<br>
sterilization art may substitute other cold ionizing radiation methods for cold E-Beam<br>
sterilization by suitable adaptation of the E-Beam discussion set out below.<br>
[0048] The disclosed cold E-Beam sterilization method appears to reduce the polymer<br>
weight average and number average molecular weight values, but by less than may be<br>
observed if the polymer is sterilized using E-Beam radiation while the polymer is at<br>
ambient temperature. The disclosed method may provide reduced degradation or<br>
improved retention of polymer molecular weight and various other physical properties,<br>
e.g., shelf life, sprayability, cohesive strength, adhesive strength, or residence or retention<br>
time after placement at a treatment site. For example, a gel-forming polymer subjected to<br>
conventional (ambient temperature) E-Beam sterilization may no longer form a gel when<br>
sprayed, but the polymer gel-forming ability may be preserved when cold E-Beam<br>
sterilization is substituted for conventional E-Beam sterilization. The extent of observed<br>
change for any given physical property may depend on a variety of factors including the<br>
chosen polymer and its molecular weight and polydispersity index. The weight average or<br>
number average molecular weight following cold E-Beam sterilization may for example<br>
be at least 50 %, at least 60 %, at least 70 % or at least 80% of the corresponding weight<br>
average or number average molecular weight for the unsterilized polymer. Cold E-Beam<br>
sterilization also may increase the polydispersity index over that of the unsterilized<br>
polymer, whereas conventional E-Beam sterilization may not alter or may reduce the<br>
polydispersity index compared to that of a polymer which has not been sterilized. For<br>
example, after cold E-Beam sterilization the sterilized polymer may have a polydispersity<br>
index at least 2 %, at least 4 % or at least 8 % greater than that of the unsterilized polymer.<br>
[0049] Suitable E-Beam sterilization devices or services are available from a variety of<br>
suppliers including BeamOne LLC (San Diego, CA), E-BEAM Services, Inc. (Cranbury,<br>
NJ), Isotron (UK), L-3 Communication Pulse Sciences (San Leandro, CA), NUTEK<br>
Corporation (Hayward, CA) and Sterigenics Intemational, Inc. (San Diego, CA). The<br>
desired E-Beam radiation dosage level may vary depending on the chosen polymer(s), the<br>
chosen product form (e.g., liquid, gel, particulate or sponge) and whether or not packaging<br>
is present, and generally will be determined empirically. Sufficient E-Beam radiation<br>
should be employed to ensure a sterile product, while avoiding levels that might cause<br>
excessive chain scission and polymer degradation. The chosen dosage may for example<br>
correspond to a deposited radiation energy of about 10 to about 100 kilogray (kGy), about<br>
15 to about 50 kGy or about 20 to about 35 kGy.<br>
[0050] For some polymers (e.g., those prone to oxidation), chain scission or<br>
degradation may be further reduced by carrying out sterilization under an inert atmosphere<br>
(e.g., under nitrogen or argon gas). Whether or not an inert atmosphere is employed, it is<br>
also desirable to carry out sterilization under dry conditions (e.g., under dry air, nitrogen<br>
or argon) as doing so helps discourage premature polymer hydration. Dry conditions may<br>
also be facilitated by carrying out sterilization at or below 0° C, so that stray water vapor<br>
or moisture will tend to condense and freeze on nearby cold surfaces rather than causing<br>
premature polymer hydration.<br>
[0051] Before or following sterilization the disclosed medical device may be placed in<br>
suitable sealed packaging (e.g., a syringe, vial or bag made of a suitable material) and<br>
stored as need be or shipped to a distributor or to an end user (e.g., a surgeon, physician,<br>
dentist or other medical professional). In a preferred embodiment the medical device is<br>
sealed in suitable packaging prior to chilling or prior to sterilization so that both the device<br>
and its packaging will be in sterile form when shipped to a distributor or end user.<br>
Depending on the desired end use, the chosen packaging may include a variety of features,<br>
e.g., sterilization maintenance, shelf life indication, shelf life preservation, tamper<br>
prevention, space for labels or warnings, sufficient clarity so that the contents may be<br>
viewed or inspected, indication of tampering, indication of sterility loss, and the like.<br>
[0052] The disclosed medical device may be rehydrated prior to placement or insertion<br>
in a treatment site, or may be placed while in a dry state and then rehydrated in situ (e.g.,<br>
via the addition of an externally-supplied rehydrating fluid, by the uptake of endogenous<br>
fluids, or both). Rehydrating a sponge normally is relatively straightforward, and may be<br>
carried out by immersing or saturating the sponge with water or an aqueous solution<br>
containing any other desired ingredients. For example, normal saline solution may be a<br>
preferred and readily available rehydration solution, and other materials such as phosphate<br>
buffered saline (PBS) may be used if desired. Rehydrating rehydratable gel particles may<br>
be somewhat more difficult due to the tendency of some dry powdered materials to form<br>
clumps when combined with water. Clumping may however be avoided using a<br>
rehydration procedure described in the above-mentioned copending PCT Application No.<br>
(Attorney Docket Nos. P0027228.02 and 151-P-27228WO01), in which rehydratable gel<br>
particles are dispersed in a biocompatible water-miscible polar dispersant (e.g., ethanol,<br>
isopropanol or acetone), followed by mixing the dispersion with sufficient aqueous<br>
particle solvent (viz., a water-based solvent for the particles) to convert the particles to a<br>
cohesive hydrogel. The polar dispersant is a sufficiently poor solvent for the particles so<br>
that the mixture of particles and dispersant will not form a true solution. The particles in<br>
such a dispersion desirably are sufficiently small so that the dispersion is stable or quasi-<br>
stable (e.g., a colloidal dispersion or a reasonably persistent suspension) after the particles<br>
and dispersant have been agitated, e.g., by swirling them together. Without being bound<br>
by theory, the addition of the aqueous particle solvent is believed to permit rehydration to<br>
occur approximately simultaneously at the surface of each suspended particle via<br>
dissolution of the surrounding dispersant into the aqueous particle solvent phase, thereby<br>
permitting formation of a cohesive hydrogel without forming visible clumps of unhydrated<br>
polymer. In this fashion a dispersed hydratable polymer (e.g., a dispersed polysaccharide)<br>
may be combined with water or an aqueous solution to form a clump-free hydrogel even<br>
though the dry powdered polymer would not ordinarily do so. In many instances the<br>
disclosed method may be used to prepare a satisfactory clump-free gel using passage<br>
between two syringes, mild agitation or other simple mixing techniques without requiring<br>
the use of a mechanical stirrer. The disclosed mixing method may also permit formation<br>
of very concentrated hydrogels which could not be obtained by merely mixing a powdered<br>
hydratable polymer with water, or with water to which an acid or base has been added.<br>
[0053] When a cohesive hydrogel is prepared from a powdered hydratable polymer,<br>
the polymer concentration typically will depend on the chosen polymer molecular weight,<br>
and may for example be about 1 to about 20 %, about 1 to about 10 % or about 1 to about<br>
5 % of the rehydrated gel. The gel may desirably form in less than 30 minutes, less than<br>
20 minutes, less than 10 minutes, less than 5 minutes, less than 1 minute or even<br>
essentially immediately after rehydration. For polymers which do not immediately<br>
rehydrate, it may be desirable to saturate the powder and inject it before the polymer has<br>
become too viscous to spray or otherwise dispense through a small orifice, e.g., through<br>
the spray tip employed in a No. SA-3668 FTBRIJET™ 360° Gas Assisted Endoscopic<br>
Applicator (Micromedics, Inc., St. Paul, MN).<br>
[0054] The disclosed medical device may optionally include a variety of other<br>
ingredients before or after rehydration. Exemplary other ingredients include solvents,<br>
acids, bases, buffering agents, antimicrobial agents, therapeutic agents and other<br>
adjuvants. An acid, base or buffering agent may for example maintain a gel at an<br>
appropriate pH for contacting human tissue, e.g., a pH greater than 5, a near-neutral pH, or<br>
a pH less than 8.5. Exemplary buffering agents include barbitone sodium, glycinamide,<br>
glycine, potassium chloride, potassium phosphate, potassium hydrogen phthalate, sodium<br>
acetate, sodium citrate, sodium phosphate and their conjugate acids.<br>
[0055] The disclosed medical device desirably is inherently antimicrobial without<br>
requiring addition of a separate antimicrobial agent. A separate antimicrobial agent may<br>
be employed if desired. A useful list of such antimicrobial agents may be found, for<br>
example, in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. US 2007/0264296 A1.<br>
[0056] Exemplary therapeutic agents which may be employed in the disclosed medical<br>
device include any material suitable for use at the intended treatment site including<br>
analgesics, anti-cholinergics, anti-fungal agents, antihistamines, steroidal or non-steroidal<br>
anti-inflammatory agents, anti-parasitic agents, antiviral agents, biostatic compositions,<br>
chemotherapeutic/antineoplastic agents, cytokines, decongestants, hemostatic agents (e.g.,<br>
thrombin), immunosuppressors, mucolytics, nucleic acids, peptides, proteins, steroids,<br>
vasoconstrictors, vitamins, mixtures thereof, and other therapeutic materials that will be<br>
known to those skilled in the art. A useful list of such therapeutic agents may be found,<br>
for example, in the above-mentioned U.S. Patent Application Publication No. US<br>
2007/0264296 A1.<br>
[0057] Other adjuvants that may be included in the disclosed medical device include<br>
dyes, pigments or other colorants (e.g., FD &amp; C Red No. 3, FD &amp; C Red No. 20, FT) &amp; C<br>
Yellow No. 6, FD &amp; C Blue No.2, D &amp; C Green No. 5, D &amp; C Orange No. 4, D &amp; C Red<br>
No. 8, caramel, titanium dioxide, fruit or vegetable colorants such as beet powder or beta-<br>
carotene, turmeric, paprika and other materials that will be known to those skilled in the<br>
art); indicators; flavoring or sweetening agents including but not limited to anise oil,<br>
cherry, cinnamon oil, citrus oil (e.g., lemon, lime or orange oil), cocoa, eucalyptus, herbal<br>
aromatics (e.g., clove oil, sage oil or cassia oil), lactose, maltose, menthol, peppermint oil,<br>
saccharine, sodium cyclamate, spearmint oil, sorbitol, sucrose, vanillin, wintergreen oil,<br>
xylitol and mixtures thereof; antioxidants; antifoam agents; and rheology modifiers<br>
including thickeners and thixotropes. The disclosed medical device desirably does not<br>
contain ingredients which might potentially harm patient tissues or structures, e.g.,<br>
mucosal tissues in the nasal or sinus cavities.<br>
[0058] In those instances where it is desirable to remove water from tissue, e.g., to<br>
remove fluid from polyps or edematous tissue, a hyperosmolar agent may be employed in<br>
the disclosed medical device. Exemplary hyperosmolar agents include furosemide,<br>
sodium chloride gel and other salt preparations which draw water from tissue, and other<br>
substances which directly or indirectly change the osmolar content of the mucous layer.<br>
Where sustained release or delayed release of a therapeutic agent is desirable, a release<br>
agent modifier may also be included.<br>
[0059] An applied rehydrated gel may fill the treatment site (e.g., a nasal or sinus<br>
cavity, or an opening, recess, passageway or joint in a portion of the limbs or spinal<br>
column), in which case the disclosed gel may form a layer which is very thick and not<br>
exposed to air or other nearby gases, and with differing thicknesses throughout the layer.<br>
The disclosed rehydrated gel may also be applied as a thin film or other conformal coating<br>
in which case the gel layer may form a layer which is relatively thin and exposed to air or<br>
other nearby gases, and with a substantially uniform thickness throughout the layer. The<br>
rehydrated gel may provide a protective layer which may be viscous, elastic or<br>
viscoelastic. The protective layer desirably adheres to mucosal or other natural tissues<br>
(e.g., cartilage or bone) at the treatment site and resists detachment or other disruption<br>
until natural degradation or resorption of the gel layer takes place, e.g.-, after a residence<br>
time in vivo of from one day to a few (e.g., 2, 3 or 4) days, weeks or months. Meanwhile<br>
bacterial recolonization or reinfection may be significantly reduced or prevented, and<br>
improved healing and reciliation may take place. The protective gel layer may provide<br>
various therapeutic advantages including but not limited to bacterial adhesion repellence,<br>
anti-infective properties, local immune modulation, tissue protection, reduction or<br>
elimination of pain or bleeding, reduction in inflammation, optimization of environment<br>
for ciliary regrowth, reduction in adhesions to critical anatomy, and the like. These<br>
advantages may arise due to a variety of mechanisms including a) killing bacteria, b)<br>
inhibiting bacterial colonization, c) inhibiting the adherence of bacteria to tissue, d)<br>
reducing tissue morbidity or abscess formation, e) reducing or preventing disease<br>
recurrence (e.g., specifically reducing the chronic inflammation related to bacterial toxin<br>
and the encapsulated polysaccharide in a bacterial biofilm), f) coating and protecting tissue<br>
during healing, such as by maintenance of a moist wound which promotes platelet<br>
aggregation, or by closure of a dry wound without excessive scabrous formation, g)<br>
hemostasis, h) optimizing the environment for reciliation of the mucosa, i) speeding the<br>
growth or regrowth of cilia and j) delivering therapeutic agent(s) to the treatment site.<br>
Desirably the protective gel layer will adhere to a portion of the mucosa while leaving the<br>
cilia in unadhered portions free to undergo natural rhythmic cilia motion (viz., cilia<br>
beating), will if desired also deliver antimicrobial agents or additional therapeutic agents,<br>
and desirably will discourage or prevent bacteria from adhering to the treatment site.<br>
[0060] The disclosed medical device may desirably be used as a part of a multi-step<br>
treatment regimen which disrupts a bacterial biofilm and discourages its return. For<br>
example, a series of steps that may be broadly classified as Cleansing/Disrupting, Killing,<br>
Aerating, Protecting/Coating, and Healing may be carried out. The Cleansing/Disrupting<br>
step may be carried out by administering a solvating system as discussed in the above-<br>
mentioned U.S. Patent Application Publication No. US 2007/0264296 A1. The Killing<br>
step may be carried out by applying a suitable antimicrobial agent to the treatment site.<br>
This may for example be accomplished by including an antimicrobial agent in the<br>
solvating system, as a separately-applied composition, or in both the solvating system and<br>
in a separately-applied composition. An antimicrobial agent may also be applied or<br>
administered post operatively. The Aerating step may be carried out by providing air<br>
passageways or improving air passageways to the treated tissues by opening occluded or<br>
partially occluded passages, e.g., the sinuses or sinus ostia for nasal applications. This<br>
may for example be accomplished by surgically removing obstructive tissue structures or<br>
by manually displacing such structures. The Protecting/Coating step may be carried out<br>
by coating at least part of the thus-treated tissue with the disclosed gel composition or by<br>
covering at least part of the thus-treated tissue with the disclosed sponge. The Healing<br>
step may be carried out by allowing the cleansed, protected and sealed tissue surface to<br>
undergo a return to a normal state, e.g., through one or more healing mechanisms such as<br>
modulation of an inflammatory response, phagocytosis, mucosal remodeling, reciliation or<br>
full or partial restoration of normal function. The multi-step treatment regimen may<br>
include or be followed by a Clearing step in which the gel composition or sponge is<br>
sufficiently biodegradable or bioresorbable to disappear from the treatment site in a<br>
desired time period, e.g., more than 1 day, more than 3 days, or about 4 to 7 days, and<br>
desirably without shedding large solid chunks. The disclosed method may advantageously<br>
be accomplished without requiring surgery, for example by applying and removing the<br>
optional solvating system through normal aspiration/suction techniques or by simple<br>
flushing of affected tissue followed by application of the disclosed gel composition or<br>
sponge. A comparable series of steps may be performed in a multi-step treatment regimen<br>
in a portion of the middle or inner ear. Further details regarding such a regimen may be<br>
found in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. US 2007/0264310 A1.<br>
[0061] The invention is further illustrated in the following non-limiting examples.<br>
Example 1<br>
[0062] Samples of a low molecular weight hydratable gel-forming polysaccharide<br>
polymer (PROTASAN™ G113 170,000 kDa chitosan glutamate from the NovaMatrix<br>
unit of FMC BioPolymer AS) and a medium molecular weight hydratable gel-forming<br>
polysaccharide polymer (PROTASAN G213 350,000 kDa chitosan glutamate from the<br>
NovaMatrix unit of FMC BioPolymer AS) were solubilized in PBS at a 5 wt. % polymer<br>
concentration and then lyophilized to form dry powders. An unsterilized portion of each<br>
sample was evaluated to determine Mw, Mn and the polydispersity index via SEC-MALS<br>
using TSK-GEL™ G6000PWxl, G5000PWxl and G3000PWxl size exclusion<br>
chromatography columns from Tosoh corporation (Japan), a WATERS111* 2695 Separation<br>
Module from Waters Corp. (Milford, MA), a WATERS 2414 DRI Detector from Waters<br>
Corp., a DAWN HELEOS™ multi-angle light scattering detector from Wyatt Technology<br>
Corp. (Santa Barbara, CA) and ASTRA™ V SP macromolecular characterization software<br>
from Wyatt Technology Corp. Portions of each sample stored at about 24° C and portions<br>
chilled using a freezer to -20 to -25° C were sterilized using E-Beam radiation at a dose of<br>
25 kGy and evaluated to determine Mw, Mn and the polydispersity index. The results are<br>
shown below in Table 1:<br>
[0063] The results in Table 1 show that freezing the polymer before E-Beam<br>
sterilization resulted in considerably better molecular weight retention than was observed<br>
if the polymer was E-Beam sterilized while at ambient temperature.<br>
[0064] The Table 1 samples were also evaluated to determine their spray<br>
characteristics. Each sample was dissolved in water at a 5 % concentration. Using the<br>
above-mentioned No. SA-3668 FIBRIJET™ 360° Gas Assisted Endoscopic Applicator,<br>
the resulting solutions were sprayed onto a horizontal surface together with a 5 wt. %<br>
solution of oxidized starch. The unsterilized materials (viz., Run No. 1 and Run No. 4)<br>
formed non-dripping gels, with the unsterilized G113 sample of Run No. 1 providing<br>
better gelation and spray properties than the G213 sample of Run No. 4. After ambient or<br>
cold E-Beam sterilization, the G113 samples (viz., Run No. 2 and Run No. 3) formed gels<br>
which were less viscous than those obtained using the unsterilized G113 sample of Run<br>
No. 1, and exhibited longer gelation times. The Run No. 2 and Run No. 3 samples also<br>
exhibited a tendency to drip. The gel made using the cold E-Beam sterilized sample of<br>
Run No. 3 exhibited greater viscosity and less tendency to drip than a gel made using the<br>
ambient E-Beam sterilized sample of Run No. 2.<br>
[0065] The ambient or cold E-Beam sterilized G213 samples (viz., Run No. 5 and<br>
Run No. 6) formed gels which were less viscous than those obtained using the unsterilized<br>
G213 sample of Run No. 4. The Run No. 4 and Run No. 5 samples did not drip, but the<br>
Run No. 5 sample had a slow gelation time. The gel made using the cold E-Beam<br>
sterilized sample of Run No. 6 exhibited the best balance of spray properties, gel<br>
formation, absence of dripping and gelation time among the sterilized product samples<br>
evaluated.<br>
Example 2<br>
[0066] Using the method of Example 1, gels made from lyophilized carboxy methyl-<br>
chitosan were evaluated to determine their spray, drip and gelation characteristics<br>
following ambient or cold E-Beam sterilization. After ambient temperature E-Beam<br>
sterilization, the gel thickened noticeably and behaved poorly when sprayed. After cold E-<br>
Beam sterilization, the gel had slightly lower viscosity and performed acceptably when<br>
sprayed.<br>
[0067] Although specific embodiments have been illustrated and described herein for<br>
purposes of description of the preferred embodiments, it will be appreciated by those of<br>
ordinary skill in the art that a wide variety of alternate or equivalent implementations<br>
calculated to achieve the same purposes may be substituted for the specific embodiments<br>
shown and described without departing from the scope of the present invention. This<br>
application is intended to cover any adaptations or variations of the preferred<br>
embodiments discussed herein. Therefore, it is manifestly intended that this invention be<br>
limited only by the claims and the equivalents thereof.<br>
