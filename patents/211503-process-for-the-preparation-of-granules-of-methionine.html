ADISSEO FRANCE S.A.S., a French company of 42 avenue Aristide Briand, 92160 Antony, France,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed :-<br>
original<br>

PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF GRANULES OF METHIONINE<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of free<br>
5	flowing granules of methionine suitable for use as an animal feed supplement.<br>
Methionine is used as a feed additive for animals, in particular ruminants and poultry, and is useful in the production of animal proteins. Methionine is produced by the conversion of methionine nitrile to methionine amide, followed by saponification of the amide. The resulting methionine product is a fine powder<br>
10	and a problem encountered on the production plant is the presence of static<br>
electricity, providing a high risk of explosion. To overcome this problem, the powdered methionine is recrystallised. This involves an additional step in the process. The recrystallised methionine may then be used in this form as the feed supplement.<br>
15	An alternative means to overcome this problem is disclosed in European<br>
Patent No. 0992490 in which the powdered methionine is converted to granules. This method comprises forming extrudates from the powdered methionine, and then treating the extrudates to provide substantially spherical particles. EP-A-0992490 purports to provide a method of producing granules of methionine for<br>
20	use in animal feed which avoids the problem of dust and ultimate risk associated<br>
with static electricity.<br>
We have developed a process for the production of granules of methionine that produces directly the spherical granules of methionine without the need for the additional step of treating the granules to obtain the desired spherical<br>
25	shape.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for the preparation of granules of methionine which process comprises (a) forming a mixture of methionine powder, a binding agent and water (b) applying the mixture to high shear rate mixing, thereby forming granules of said mixture; and (c) drying said<br>
30	granules.<br>
The process of the present invention negates the need to shape the product. We have also found that the resulting granules have specific advantageous properties that render them particularly suitably for incorporation into animal feed, in particular good mixability.<br>

WO 02/31555<br><br>
"     PCT/EP01/09877<br><br>
For the purposes of the present invention, "methionine powder"  is<br>
defined as particles of methionine in which less than 40% of the particles have a<br>
size greater than 150 microns.  In particular, it is preferred that less than 10% of<br>
the particles are greater than 150 microns and that the powder has a bulk density<br>
5	of from 300 to 500 kg/m3 and a tapped density of from 500 to 600 kg/m3.<br>
The process of the present invention comprises a first step of forming a mixture of methionine powder, a binding agent and water. The methionine powder may be used as is, in the solid form, or may be used as a suspension of methionine in water. Suitably, the mixture comprises from 30 to 82 weight %,<br>
10	preferably from 55 to 80 weight % methionine.<br>
Suitable binding agents for inclusion into the mixture include celluloses, for example, microcrystalline cellulose, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose and carboxyl methyl cellulose; starch for example native, pregelatmized or modified starch; hydrocolloid gums, for example, xanthane gum, guar gum, carob gum and<br>
15	arabic gum; polyvinyl alcohol; polyvinyl pyrrolidone; sugars and syrup of sugars,<br>
for example a mixture of oligo and polysaccharides. The preferred binder is a starch or a hydrocolloid gum, especially xanthane or arabic gum. Suitably, the binder is present in the mixture in an amount of from 0.3 to 10 % by weight, preferably from 0.5 to 5% by weight. The binder may be added in the solid form<br>
20	or in the liquid form, especially as an aqueous solution.<br>
Water may be admixed with the other components before application of the high shear rate mixing or may be added during the high shear mixing. Water may be present in the mixture in an amount of from 15 to 65 % by weight, preferably from 15 to 40 % by weight.<br>
25	Additional components may be present in the mixture. A surfactant may<br>
be added to the mixture. Suitable surfactants include non ionic surfactants such as polyoxyethylene sorbitan fatty acid esters 20 to 80 or anionic surfactants such as dodecyl sodium sulphonate. The surfactant may be present in an amount of from 0 to 1.5 % by weight, preferably from 0.1 to 1 % by weight.<br>
30	Certain salts that are known to have an efficacious effect in animals may<br>
also be present in the mixture. The salt may be added as a separate component prior to the high shear rate mixing. Alternatively, the salt may be present as an admixture with the methionine powder and may be granulated with the methionine powder.  In such case, the methionine powder may be used directly<br>
35	from the production method which can comprise a mixture of methionine and a<br>
3<br><br>
WO .02/11555<br><br>
PCT/EP01/09877<br><br>
salt, the salt having been co-formed during the saponification step. In particular,<br>
metal salts of Group I or II of the Periodic Table, for example, sodium or<br>
potassium, especially sodium, may be present with the methionine powder.<br>
Suitable salts are halides such as sodium chloride, sulphates such as sodium<br>
5	sulphate and the methioninate salt such as sodium methioninate. Suitably, the salt<br>
may be present in the mixture in an amount of from 0 to 30 %, preferably from 10 to 20% by weight.<br>
Further nutritionally active compounds may also be present, for example amino acids such as lysine and vitamins such as Vitamin A and Vitamin E. Such<br>
10	compounds may be present in the mixture in an amount of from 0 to 20 weight %.<br>
The second step of the process of the present invention involves high<br>
shear rate mixing of the mixture to form the granules. The mixing is carried out<br>
using any suitable apparatus that is capable of providing the necessary mixing, for<br>
example, high shear and high speed mixers, especially an impeller mixer in which<br>
15	the mixture is centrifuged against the walls of the mixer chamber.  The speed of<br>
the mixer will depend upon the size and capacity of the mixer. The mixing is suitably carried out at a speed of at least 5 ms1, preferably between 30 and 80 ms"  This granulation step may be carried out at ambient or elevated temperature, preferably at ambient temperature.<br>
20	The resulting granules are then dried, preferably using a fluidised bed<br>
drier at a temperature of up to 150°C, preferably between 20 and 150°C.<br>
The aforementioned processes may be carried out as a continuous process or as a batch process.<br>
The granule produced from this granulation process has a substantially<br>
25	spherical shape and, thus, does not require further treatment.    A particular<br>
advantage of the granule produced by the method of the present invention is that the granule has a bulk density similar to the resulting pellet of animal feed to which the methionine granule is to be incorporated. The resulting methionine granule also exhibits good mixability in the animal feed. In particular, it has been<br>
30	found that the method of the present invention provides granules of methionine<br>
having a bulk density of at least 0.6g/cm3, preferably at least 0.7g/cm3, this being in the same region as the density of the animal feed pellets. Thus, according to another aspect of the present invention there is provided granules of methionine prepared as hereinbefore defined having a bulk density of at least 0.6g/cm3.<br>
4<br><br>
WO 02/11555<br><br>
PCT/EP01/09877<br><br>
The granules of methionine suitably have a particle size distribution of<br>
from 50 to 2000 microns, preferably from 100 to 1500 microns, especially from<br>
200 to 1200 microns, with less than 10% of the granules being less than 200<br>
microns and less than 10% greater than 1000 microns.<br>
5	The granules of methionine produced by the process of the present<br>
invention suitably contain from 65 to 98 % methionine, 0.3 to 12 % binding agent, less than .1% water and from.O to 1.7 % by weight surfactant When a salt is present in the mixture, the ratio of methionine to salt suitably is from 0.7 to 1.<br>
In particular, we have found that granules of methionine comprising<br>
10	sodium chloride, have a bulk density of at least 0.7g/cm3 and the particle size<br>
distribution is of from 100 microns to 2000 microns, preferably from 400 to 1500 microns.<br>
The granules of methionine may be used as an animal feed supplement<br>
and thus according to a further aspect of the present invention there is provided an<br>
15	animal feed composition comprising granules of methionine as hereinbefore<br>
defined.<br>
The invention will now be illustrated with reference to the following examples:<br>
Examples 1 to 7 exemplify the preparation of the granules of methionine<br>
20	according to the present invention. Comparative Examples A to D exemplify the<br>
preparation of granules according to the prior art method.<br>
In Examples 1 to 7, the following equipment was used:<br>
A Fryma Diosna mixer of 30 litres capacity<br>
A Retsch TG-1 fluidised bed dryer.<br>
25	In comparative Examples A to D the following equipment was used:<br>
A Lodige blender of 5 litres capacity<br>
A Fuji Paudal DG-L1 extruder (flow .5 to 50 kg/hour)<br>
A Retsch TG-1 fluidised bed dryer<br>
To evaluate the properties of the granules the following standard tests<br>
30	were carried out:<br>
(1)	Water Content - The amount of water was determined by infra red balance at 105°C until constant weight.<br>
(2)	Granule Size - The size of the granule was measured by passing l00g of granules through Retsch sieves with 1.5 mm of amplitude for 10<br>
35	minutes.<br>

WO 02/11555		PCT/EPO1/09877<br><br>
(3)	Bulk and Tapped Density - The bulk and tapped density were measured by powder volumenometer (230 nil).<br>
(4)	Carr Index - Defined as: (Bulk Density - Tapped Density) / Bulk Density.<br>
(5)	The Jenike Index was measured by a flow tester which is the ring shear stress of Schulze (device referenced RST-01.01 Dr Ing. Dietmar Schulze, Wolfenbuttel, Germany). Jenike Index is defined by the ratio of principal stress at a steady flow to the unconfined yield strength.<br>

Comparative to Example 7<br>
The procedure of Example A was repeated but with the addition of sodium<br>
chloride salt and with the following amounts of components.<br>
Table D<br><br>
Component	Concentration of" Component (%)	Concentration in dry granule (%)	Weight (g)<br>
powdered methionine	52.00	68.33	416.0<br>
pregelatinised starch	0.50	0.67	4.0<br>
sodium chloride	22.50	30.0	180.0<br>

WO 02/11555<br><br>
PCT/EP01/09877<br><br>
The concentration of starch in solution was 2 %w/w.<br>
60% of the granules had a size distribution of between 200 and 1000<br>
microns with 26% greater that 1000 microns and 14% less than 200 microns. The<br>
bulk density and tapped density were determined to be 0.570 g/cm3 and 0.640<br>
5	g/cm3 respectively. The Carr Index was determined to be 12%.<br>
It can be seen from these examples that the process of the present invention provides granules with greater bulk density than the extrusion method.<br>
