The present invention relates to latices comprising two populations of jparticles of polymers based on vinyl chloride, their preparation and use*<br>
Bipopulated latices of particles of polymers based on vinyl chloride, respectively exhibiting mean diameters of between 0.4 and 2.5 [Mm  and between 0.08 and 1 pm,   in a ratio of the diameters of between 1 and 20 and a ratio by weight of between 0.1 and 10, are known. These latices are prepared by seeded microsuspension polymerization of the corresponding monomer or monomers in the presence of a first seeding polymer, the particles of which contain at least one organosoluble initiator, of a second seeding polymer, of a surface-active agent and of a soluble metal salt, in an amount such that the molar ratio of the metal salt to the organosoluble initiator is between 0.1 and 10 (French Patent Specification 2 309 569). The polymerization is carried out in the absence of supplementary addition of initiator.<br>
Moreover, US Patent Specification 5 151 476 teaches that the metal salt/organosoluble initiator molar ratio can be reduced and that the polymerization can even be carried out in the absence of metal salt.<br>
Bipopulated latices currently known, in particular those prepared by seeded microsuspension polymerization, lead either to fluid plastisols or to foams of good cellular quality. It has not previously<br><br>
been possible to obtain both fluid plastisols and foams of high cellular quality from the same latex.<br>
According to the invention, there is provided a latex comprising two populations of particles of polymers based on vinyl chloride, one population having a mean diameter of between 0.9 and 1.3 fim  and one population having a mean diameter of between 0.15 and 0.3 /Ltm, in proportions such that the ratio by weight of the population with the lesser mean diameter to that with the greater mean diameter is between 0.4 and 0.7.<br>
Polymers based on vinyl chloride is understood to mean homo- and copolymers, the latter containing at least 50% by weight of vinyl chloride and at least one monomer which is capable of copolymerizing with vinyl chloride. The copolymerizable monomers are those generally employed in conventional techniques for the copolymerization of vinyl chloride. Mention may be made of vinyl esters of mono- and polycarboxylic acids, such as vinyl acetate, propionate or benzoate; unsaturated mono- and polycarboxylic acids, such as acrylic, methacrylic, maleic, fumaric or itaconic acid, and their aliphatic, cycloaliphatic or aromatic esters, their amides or their nitriles; alkyl, vinyl or vinylidene halides; alkyl vinyl ethers and olefins.<br>
The preferred polymers based on vinyl chloride are vinyl chloride homopolymers.<br>
The latex according to the present invention can be obtained by seeded microsuspension<br><br>
polymerization of the corresponding monomer or monomers in the presence of a first seeding polymer (PI), the particles of which contain at J.east one organosoluble initiator, of a second seeding polymer (P2), the particles of which have a mean diameter less than that of the particles of the first seeding polymer (PI), of water, of an anionic emulsifier, of a soluble metal salt, in an amount such that the metal salt/organosoluble initiator molar ratio is less than 0.09, and of a reducing agent.<br>
According to one aspect of the process of preparation the reducing agent is the metabisulphite of an alkali metal and preferably potassium metabisulphite. The amount of reducing agent used is preferably between 30 and 120 ppm with respect to the monomer(s) involved.<br>
The first seeding polymer (PI) necessary for the polymerization can be prepared according to conventional microsuspension polymerization techniques. It is used in the form of an aqueous dispersion of its particles, the mean diameter of which is preferably between 0.4 and 0.7 /xm.<br>
A means for preparing this seeding polymer comprises making use of water, vinyl chloride, alone or in combination with one or a number of copolymerizable monomer(s), an organosoluble initiator and an anionic emulsifier, optionally in combination with a non-ionic emulsifier. The monomer or monomers are finely<br><br>
dispersed in water using an energetic mechanical means, such as, for example, colloid mill, fast pump, vibratory agitator or ultrasonic device. *The microsuspension obtained is then heated tinder autogenous pressure and with moderate stirring at a temperature generally of between 30 and 65Â°C. After the fall in the pressure, the reaction is halted and the unconverted monomer or monomers are degassed.<br>
The organosoluble initiators to be employed in the preparation of the first seeding polymer (PI) are represented by organic peroxides, such as lauroyl, decanoyl and caproyl peroxides, tert-butyl diethylperacetate, diethylhexyl percarbonate, diacetyl peroxide and dicetyl peroxide carbonate.<br>
The choice of the organosoluble initiator depends on its rate of decomposition at the reaction temperature adopted. This is because the said initiator must be sufficiently reactive to make it possible to carry out the seeding polymerization within times of between 4 and 12 hours and with normal doses, of the order of 0.1 to 3% by weight with respect to the monomer or to the mixture of monomers, and its rate of decomposition must be such that the amount of initiator decomposed in the preparation of the seeding polymer does not exceed half the amount of initiator employed. For this, it is therefore necessary to choose an initiator with a half-life such that the proportion of initiator destroyed during the preparation of the<br><br>
seeding polymer is between 5 and 50% by weight of all the initiator employed.<br>
Moreover, the organosoluble initiator chosen must be insoluble in water. Lauroyl peroxide is advantageously chosen.<br>
In the case where a number of organosoluble initiators are employed, it is advantageous to choose them with different reactivities; the most reactive initiators act mainly during the preparation of the seeding polymer, whereas the least reactive initiators act in particular during the seeded polymerization.<br>
The second seeding polymer (P2) is provided in the form of an aqueous dispersion of polymer particles, the mean diameter of which is preferably between 0 .1 and 0 â¢ 14 /am.<br>
This particle dispersion can be obtained by conventional microsuspension or emulsion polymerization techniques.<br>
When the second seeding polymer.(P2) is prepared by microsuspension polymerization, the preparation is carried out as described above but the homogenization is more developed.<br>
The second seeding polymer (P2) is preferably prepared by emulsion polymerization, which comprises making use of water, vinyl chloride, alone or in combination with one or a number of copolymerizable monomer(s), a water-soluble initiator and an anionic emulsifier, optionally in combination with a non-ionic<br><br>
The reaction mixture is suitably heated under autogenous pressure and moderate stirring at a temperature of between 30 and 65 Â°C. After fall in pressure, the reaction is halted and the unconverted monomer or monomers are degassed.<br>
The water-soluble initiators necessary for the preparation of the second seeding polymer (P2) are generally represented by hydrogen peroxide or alkali metal or ammonium persulphates, optionally in combination with water-soluble reducing agents, such as alkali metal sulphites or bisulphites. The highly variable amounts used depend on the initiator system chosen and are just sufficient to provide for the polymerization within reasonable times.<br>
In the process according to the present invention, the rate of polymerization is accelerated by the action of the water-soluble metal salt and of the reducing agent on the organosoluble initiator. The metal salt is employed in an amount such that the metal salt/initiator molar ratio is preferably between 0.001 and 0.1 and more particularly between 0.001 and 0.03. The metal is generally chosen from iron, copper, cobalt, nickel, zinc, tin, titanium, vanadium, manganese, chromium and silver. Copper is advantageously chosen.<br>
The presence of the anionic emulsifier, optionally in combination with at least one non-ionic<br><br>
emulsifier, improves the stability of the microsuspension. The emulsifier or emulsifiers can be added to the reaction mixture i&gt;efore and/or after and/or during polymerization. The anionic emulsifiers are preferably chosen from alkaline alkyl phosphates, alkyl sulphosuccinates, allylsulphonates, vinylsulphonates, alkylarylsulphonates, alkylsulphonates, ethoxylated alkyl sulphates, alkyl sulphates or fatty acid soaps. The preferred non-ionic emulsifiers are polycondensates of ethylene or propylene oxide with various hydroxylated organic compounds.<br>
The amounts of emulsifier can represent up to 3% by weight of the monomer or monomers involved.<br>
The amount of water necessary for the polymerization according to the invention is generally such that the initial concentration of seeding polymers, plus the monomer or monomers involved, is between 20 and 80% and preferably between .45 and 75% by weight with respect to the reaction mixture.<br>
In addition, the seeded polymerization according to the present invention can be carried out in the presence of one or more water-soluble initiator(s) chosen from hydrogen peroxide and alkali metal or ammonium persulphates. Ammonium persulphate is advantageously chosen.<br>
The water-soluble initiator or initiators is or are preferably introduced into the reaction mixture<br><br>
before the beginning of the seeded polymerization. The amount of water-soluble initiator(s) used is preferably between 10 and 100 ppm with respect to the monomer(s) involved.<br>
The seeded polymerization temperature is generally between 30 and 80Â°C and the duration of polymerization is between 3 0 minutes and 12 hours and preferably between 1 and 8 hours.<br>
According to another aspect of the preparation of the latex according to the present invention, the reducing agent may be chosen from alkyl hydrogen phosphates, lactones, ketones, carbazones and mono-<br>
or polycarboxylic acids, such as ascorbic acid or its derivatives, and the preparation is carried out in the presence of at least one water-soluble initiator, preferably ammonium persulphate. Ascorbic acid is advantageously chosen as reducing agent.<br>
According to a further aspect of the preparation method, the latex of the present invention can be obtained by mixing a latex (LI) comprising a single population of particles of polymers based on vinyl chloride, the mean diameter of which is between 0.9 and 1.3 /xm, with a second latex (L2) also comprising a single population of particles of polymers based on vinyl chloride, the mean diameter of which is between 0.15 and 0.3 fim,   in proportions such that the ratio by mass of polymers of the latex (L2) to those of the latex (LI) is between 0.4 and 0.7.<br><br>
The latex (LI) can be obtained by seeded microsuspension polymerization in the presence of a first seeding polymer (PI) baaed on vinyl chloride, the particles of which contain at least one organosoluble initiator, of water, of an anionic emulsifier, of a soluble metal salt, in an amount such that the metal salt/organosoluble initiator molar ratio is less than 0.09, and of reducing agent.<br>
The latex (L2) can be obtained by emulsion polymerization of vinyl chloride, alone or in combination with one or more copolymerizable monomer(s), a water-soluble initiator and an anionic emulsifier, optionally in combination with a non-ionic emulsifier.<br>
According to the first two preparation method aspects, the amount of two seeding polymers used is such that the ratio by mass of the second seeding polymer (P2) to (PI) is preferably between 0.7 and 1.8.<br>
Whatever the preparation method jused, the latices thus prepared are then advantageously dried by atomization and the resulting powders are particularly suitable for the preparation of fluid plastisols and also of foams of very good cellular quality. Moreover, the foams thus prepared exhibit a high level of whiteness, preferably of the order of 45 (ASTM Standard E 313/73 D25/2W) .<br>
The invention is further illustrated with reference to the following exemplification.<br><br>
Experimental  Part<br>
(A)  Preparation of the seeding polymer (PI)<br>
The following are successively introduced into an 800 litre reactor stirred at 35 revolutions/min and adjusted to 15Â°C: 375 kg of water<br>
5	1 of the buffer solution containing 426 g of<br>
potassium dihydrogenphosphate and 117 g of pure<br>
sodium hydroxide<br>
11 g of benzoquinone powder<br>
6	kg of lauroyl peroxide<br>
320 kg of vinyl chloride<br>
48 kg of a 10% by weight aqueous sodium<br>
dodecylbenzene sulphonate solution,<br>
the reactor being placed under vacuum just before<br>
the introduction of the vinyl chloride,<br>
A fine dispersion of the vinyl chloride in the aqueous mixture is then produced at a .temperature of less than or equal to 35Â°C by stirring the said mixture for 105 minutes at 5500 revolutions/min.<br>
The reaction mixture is then brought to the targeted polymerization temperature of 45Â°C under autogenous pressure, the rate of stirring being 3 0 revolutions/min. During the polymerization, benzoquinone is introduced continuously with a constant throughput of 10.5 g/h.<br>
After the fall in pressure to a value of 3.5<br><br>
bars, that is to say after 8 hours, the unreacted vinyl chloride is degassed. A latex is thus obtained, the particles of which have a mean, diameter of approximately 0.55 /xm and contain approximately 2% by weight of lauroyl peroxide with respect to the polymer.<br>
(B)  Preparation of the seeding polymer (P2)<br>
The following are introduced into an 800 litre reactor equipped with a stirrer:<br>
415 kg of water<br>
1.25 kg of lauric acid and<br>
0.8 kg of pure sodium hydroxide.<br>
The mixture is then brought to a temperature of 65Â°C and is maintained at this temperature for one hour. The mixture is then cooled to 55Â°C and then the reactor is placed under vacuum. While maintaining the temperature of the mixture at 55Â°C, 400 kg of vinyl chloride and 4 litres of an aqueous solution containing 109 g of ammonium persulphate are then introduced, followed by the continuous addition, with a constant throughput of 3 1/h, of an aqueous solution containing, in 30 litres of water, 0.72 g of copper sulphate, 18 g of potassium, metabisulphite and 0.54 litre of 12N aqueous ammonia. Three hours after the introduction of the persulphate, an aqueous solution containing 4.56 kg of sodium dodecylbenzene sulphonate per 40 litres of water is continuously added to the reaction mixture for 5 hours at 8 1/h. When the internal pressure is 4.5<br><br>
bars, the reaction is halted by rapid cooling and an aqueous sodium dodecylbenzene sulphonate solution, containing 7.28 kg on a dry basis, is then introduced. The polymer particles obtained have a mean diameter in the region of 0.11 /on.<br>
(C)  Preparation of the latex (L2)<br>
The following are introduced into a 28 litre reactor equipped with a stirrer:<br>
9650 g of water<br>
100 cm3 of an aqueous solution containing<br>
0.975 g of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)<br>
0.191 g of iron sulphate<br>
1.78 g of sodium formaldehydesulphoxylate<br>
9.8 g of lauric acid and<br>
3.25 g of pure sodium hydroxide.<br>
The reactor is then placed under vacuum before the introduction of 7000 g of vinyl chloride. The reaction mixture is then brought to tlie targeted temperature of 58Â°C. As soon as the mixture reaches 45Â°C, an aqueous solution containing 3.5 g of potassium persulphate per 1 litre of water is introduced continuously. One hour after the beginning of the introduction of the latter, one litre of solution containing 56 g of dodecylbenzene sulphonate is added continuously at a constant throughput for 4 hours. When the internal pressure is 4 bars, the reactor is re.exposed to the air and then cooled. After<br><br>
polymerizing for 4 hours and 30 minutes, the concentration by weight of polymer is 41% and the degree of conversion of the vinyl chloride is 93%. The mean diameter of the polymer particles is 0.2 /an.<br>
Comparative Example 1<br>
The following are successively introduced, by suction, into an 800 litre reactor equipped with a stirrer and placed under vacuum beforehand:<br>
400 kg of demineralized water 80 g of potassium dihydrogenphosphate 0.63 g of copper sulphate (CuS04'5H20) 15.44 kg, on a dry basis, of the seeding polymer PI latex<br>
9.08 kg, on a dry basis, of the seeding polymer P2 latex.<br>
The reactor at room temperature, with stirring and containing the aqueous mixture, is again placed under vacuum. 400 kg of vinyl chloride are then introduced and the reaction mixture is then brought to the targeted temperature of 58Â°C. As soon as the temperature of the mixture reaches 55Â°C, an aqueous ascorbic acid solution is introduced continuously, followed, after one hour, by an aqueous sodium dodecylbenzene sulphonate solution.<br>
When the pressure of the mixture is 4 bars, i.e. after polymerizing for 6 hours, the introduction of the aqueous solutions and the heating are halted and<br><br>
the reactor is cooled.<br>
The total amount of ascorbic acid and of sodium dodecylbenzene sulphonate introduced is 23 g and 3.2 kg respectively.<br>
A latex is obtained, the polymer concentration of which is 47%. Particle size analysis shows that the polymer is formed of two populations, the particles of which have mean diameters of 0.23 fim and 1.09 [xm  respectively. The fine particles represent 15.5% by weight of the polymer.<br>
