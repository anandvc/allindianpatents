The present invention relates to a method of controlling harmful fungi, which comprises treating the fungi, or the materials, plants, the soil or seeds to be protected against fungal infection, with an effective amount of a bisoxime of the formula I<br><br>
or a salt or adduct thereof, the index and the substituents having the following meanings:<br>
R1  is halogen, C1-C6-alkyl or C1-C4-haloalkyl;<br>
R2  is cyano, nitro, halogen, C1-C4-alkyl, C1-C4-haloalkyl, C1-C4-alkoxy, C1-C4-haloalkoxy, C1-C4-alkylthio, C1-C4-alkylamino, di-C1-C4-alkylamino, C1-C4-alkylaminocarbonyl,<br>
phenyl, phenoxy or phenylthio, it being possible for these radicals to be partially or fully halogenated in the phenyl moiety and/or to have attached to them one to three of the following groups: cyano, formyl, C1-C4-alkyl, C1-C4-haloalkyl, C1-C4-alkylcarbonyl, Ci~C4-alkoxy, C1-C4-haloalkoxy, phenyl or naphthyl;<br>

C3-C6-haloalkenyl, C3~C6-alkynyl, C3~C6-haloalkynyl or phenyl-C1-C4-alkyl.<br>
In addition, the invention relates to the use of the compounds I for the preparation of a composition which is suitable for controlling harmful fungi.<br>
Bisoximes of the formula I defined at the outset have been disclosed in the literature (cf. WO-A 95/18,789; WO-A 95/21,153; WO-A 95/21,154; WO-A 95/21,156; WO-A 96/06,072; WO-A 96/16,026; WO-A 96/16,030; WO-A 97/01,530; WO-A 97/02,255; DE Appl. No. 19 540 989; DE Appl. No. 19 545 878; DE Appl. No. 19 548 370) as<br><br>
intermediates for the preparation of fungicidally active ingredients of the type of the formula A:<br><br>
However, apart from the usefulness of these compounds as intermediates, these documents do not suggest any additional possible applications of the bisoximes.<br>
In addition, PCT/EP 96/01,306 describes processes for the preparation of essentially isomerically pure bisoximes of the type of the compounds I. As regards the use of such compounds, this document refers to the suitability as intermediate for the preparation of the compounds of type (A).<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide compounds with fungicidal properties.<br>
We have found that this object is achieved by the prior-art bisoximes, which are suitable for controlling harmful fungi in an efficient manner.<br>
The meaning of the collective terms used in the definition of the compounds I can be seen, for example, from the relevant information in WO-A 95/21,156.<br>
As regards their intended use for controlling harmful fungi, particularly suitable compounds I are those where R1 is fluorine, chlorine or bromine (in particular chlorine) or methyl, ethyl, propyl or iso-propyl (in particular methyl or ethyl).<br>
Dther preferred compounds I are those where n is 1, 2 or 3 (especially 1 or 2).<br>
In the event that n is 1, preferred compounds I are those where bhe radical R2 is bonded in the 4-position of the phenyl ring.<br>
In the event that n is 2, preferred compounds I are those where the radicals R2 are bonded in the relative position 2,4 or 3,4 (especially 2,4).<br><br>

Other particularly preferred compounds I are those where at least one of the radicals R2 is halogen.<br>
With regard to the radical R3, preferred compounds I are those which have attached to them, in this position,<br>
•	C1-Cio-alkyl (especially C1-C4-alkyl),<br>
•	C3-C6~alkenyl or C3-C6~haloalkenyl [especially C3-C4-alkenyl which may have attached to it one to three (in particular one or two) halogen atoms (in particular chlorine or bromine)],<br>

The compounds I are suitable as fungicides. They are distinguished by outstanding activity against a broad spectrum of phytopathogenic fungi, in particular from the classes of the Ascojnycetes, Deutero/nycetes, Phycomycetes  and Basidiomycetes. Some of them are systemically active, and they can be employed in crop protection as foliar- and soil-acting fungicides.<br>
They are especially important for controlling a large number of fungi on a variety of crop plants, such as wheat, rye, barley, oats, rice, maize, grass, bananas, cotton, soya, coffee, sugarcane, grapevines, fruit species, ornamentals and vegetables<br><br>

Synthesis Examples<br>
With due modification of the starting compounds, the protocols shown in the synthesis examples below were used for obtaining further compounds I. The resulting compounds, together with physical data, are listed in the tables which follow.<br><br>
1.  1-[4-Chlorophenyl]propane-l,2-dione 2-oxime<br><br>
First of all, 100 ml of saturated etheric hydrochloric acid were added dropwise at -10°C to -20°C to a solution of 45 g (0.27 mol) of 4-chloropropiophenone and 500 ml of toluene, and then a solution of 44.5 g of n-butyronitrile in 200 ml of diethyl ether were added. After approx. 24 hours at 20-22°C, the reaction mixture was poured into ice-water. The organic phase was isolated and washed three times with 1 N sodium hydroxide solution and once with 3 N sodium hydroxide solution. The sodium hydroxide phases were combined and acidified with 20% strength sulfuric acid to a pH of 5. The precipitate formed during this process was isolated and dissolved in tert-butyl methyl ether. The solution was dried over sodium sulfate, and the solvent was removed under reduced pressure. This gave 81.4 g of the product as a pale yellow solid.<br>
*H NMR (CDC13, 5 in ppm) : 2.2 (s, 3H) ; 7.4 (m, 2H) ; 7.8 (m, 2H); 9.0 (s, 1H)<br>
2 .  4-Chlorophenyl-[E/E,Z/E]-2-hydroxyimino-1-methoxyimino-propane<br><br>
68.5 g (0.82 mol) of O-methylhydroxylamine hydrochloride and 97 g (1.23 mol) of pyridine were added to a mixture of 81.4 g of 1-[4-chlorophenyl]-propane-1,2-dione 2-oxime and 500 ml of methanol. After approx. 24 hours at 22-25°C, the reaction mixture was poured into 10% strength hydrochloric acid. The mixture was extracted repeatedly with tert-butyl methyl ether. The organic phases were combined, washed with water and dried over sodium sulfate. The solvent was<br><br>
subsequently removed under reduced pressure. This gave 89.4 g of the product (isomer mixture).<br>
4-Chlorophenyl-[E/E]-2-hydroxyimino-l-methoxyiminopropane<br><br>
26.6 g (0.2 mol) of aluminum trichloride were slowly added at 40°C to a solution of 89.4 g (0.39 mol) of 4-chlorophenyl-[E/E,Z/E] -2-hydroxyimino-l-methoxyimino-propane in 500 ml of toluene. After 5 hours at 50°C and a further 24 hours at 20-22°C, the reaction mixture was poured into a mixture of ice and 10% strength hydrochloric acid. The resulting mixture was extracted repeatedly with tert-butyl methyl ether. The organic phases were combined, washed with 10% strength hydrochloric acid and subsequently with water, and dried. The solvent was subsequently removed under reduced pressure. This gave 50.6 g of the product as a colorless solid (m.p.: 175-178°C; isomeric ratio 98.5% E/E and 1.5% Z/E).<br>
iH NMR (CDC13, 8 in ppm) : 2.1 (s, 3H) ; 4.0 (s, 3H) ; 7.1 (m, 2H) ; 7.3 (m, 2H) ; 8.0 (s, IH)<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Examples of the action against harmful fungi:<br>
The fungicidal action of the compounds of the formula I was demonstrated by the following experiments:<br>
The active ingredients were formulated as a 10% emulsion in a mixture of 63% by weight of cyclohexanone and 27% by weight of emulsifier and diluted with water to give the desired concentration.<br>
1.	Action against Erysiphe graminis var.   tritici   (powdery<br>
mildew of wheat)<br>
Leaves of wheat seedlings (cultivar "Fruhgold") were first of all treated with the aqueous formulation of the active ingredients (rate of application: 250 ppm). After approx. 24 hours, the plants were dusted with spores of powdery mildew wheat (Erysiphe graminis var.   tritici).  The plants thus treated were subsequently incubated for 7 days at 20-22°C and a relative atmospheric humidity of 75-80%. The extent of fungal development was subsequently determined.<br>
In this test, the plants which had been treated with the compounds 1.5, 1.15, 1.19, 1.20, 1.21, 1.22, 1.27, 1.28, 1.36, 1.42, 1.63 and 1.76 showed a disease level of 10% or less, while the disease level of the untreated (control) plants was 75%.<br>
2.	Action against Plasmopara viticola<br>
Leaves of grapevines in pots, cultivar "Muller-Thurgau", were sprayed to run-off point with an aqueous formulation of active ingredient. To assess the long-term action of the substances, the plants were placed in the greenhouse for 7 days after the spray coating had dried on. Only then were the leaves inoculated with an aqueous zoospore suspension of Plasmopara viticola. Thereafter, the grapevines were placed first of all in a water-vapor-saturated chamber for 4 8 hours at 24°C and subsequently in the greenhouse for 5 days at from 20 to 3 0°C. After this time, the plants were returned into a humid chamber for 16 hours to accelerate the eruption of sporangiophores. The extent to which the disease had developed on the undersides of the leaves was then determined visually.<br><br>
In this test, the plants which had been treated with 250  ppm of the compounds 1.39, 1.44 and 1.83 showed a disease level of 15% or less, while the disease level of the untreated (control) plants was 70%.<br><br><br>
