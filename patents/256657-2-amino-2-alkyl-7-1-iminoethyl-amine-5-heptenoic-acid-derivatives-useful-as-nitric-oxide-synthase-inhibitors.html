2-Amino"2"Alkyl-5 Heptenoic and Heptvnoic Acid Derivatives Useful as Nitric Oxide Synthase Inhibitors<br>
Cross Reference to Related Applications<br>
This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Serial No. 60/232,683, filed September 15, 2000.<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to 2-amino-2-alkyl-5 heptenoic and heptynoic acid derivatives and their use in therapy, in particular their use as nitric oxide synthase inhibitors. Related Art<br>
It has been known since the early 1980's that the vascular relaxation caused by acetylcholine is dependent on the vascular endothelium. The endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF), now known to be nitric oxide (NO) is generated in the vascular endothelium by nitric oxide synthase (NOS). The activity of NO as a vasodilator has been known for well over 100 years. In addition, NO is the active species deriving from amylnitrite, glyceryltrinitrate and other nitrovasodilators. The identification of EDRF as NO has coincided with the discovery of a biochemical pathway by which NO is synthesized from the amino acid L-arginine by the enzyme NO synthase.<br>
Nitric oxide is an endogenous stimulator of the soluble guanylate cyclase. In addition to endothelium-dependent relaxation, NO is involved in a number of biological actions including cytotoxicity of phagocytic cells and cell-to-cell communication in the central nervous system.<br>
There are at least three types of NO synthase as follows:<br>
(i) a constitutive, Ca++/calmodulin dependent enzyme, located in the endothelium, that releases NO in response to receptor or physical stimulation.<br>
(ii) a constitutive, Ca++/calmodulin dependent enzyme, located in the brain, that releases NO in response to receptor or physical stimulation.<br>
(iii) a Ca++ independent enzyme which is induced after activation of vascular smooth muscle, macrophages, endothelial cells, and a number of other cells by<br><br>
endotoxin and cytokines. Once expressed, this inducible nitric oxide synthase (hereinafter "iNOS") generates NO continuously for long periods.<br>
The NO released by each of the two constitutive enzymes acts as a transduction mechanism underlying several physiological responses. The NO produced by the inducible enzyme is a cytotoxic molecule for tumor cells and invading microorganisms. It also appears that adverse effects of excess NO production, in particular pathological vasodilation and tissue damage, may result largely from the NO synthesized by iNOS.<br>
There is a growing body of evidence that NO may be involved in the degeneration of cartilage which takes place as a result of certain conditions such as arthritis and it is also known that NO synthesis is increased in rheumatoid arthritis and in osteoarthritis.<br>
Some of the NO synthase inhibitors proposed for therapeutic use are nonselective; they inhibit both the constitutive and the inducible NO synthases. Use of such a non-selective NO synthase inhibitor requires that great care be taken in order to avoid the potentially serious consequences of over-inhibition of the constitutive NO-synthase, such consequences including hypertension and possible thrombosis and tissue damage. In particular, in the case of the therapeutic use of L-NMMA (a non-selective NO synthase inhibitor) for the treatment of toxic shock it has been recommended that the patient must be subject to continuous blood pressure monitoring throughout the treatment. Thus, while non-selective NO synthase inhibitors have therapeutic utility provided that appropriate precautions are taken, NO synthase inhibitors which are selective in the sense that they inhibit the inducible NO synthase to a considerably greater extent than the constitutive isoforms of NO synthase would be of even greater therapeutic benefit and easier to use (S. Moncada and E. Higgs, FASEB J., 9,1319-1330,1995).<br>
PCT International Publication No. WO 93/13055 and U. S. Patent No. 5,132,453, the disclosure of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety as if written herein, disclose compounds that inhibit nitric oxide synthesis and preferentially inhibit the inducible isoformof nitric oxide synthase.<br><br>
PCX International Publication No, WO 95/25717 discloses certain amidino derivatives as being useful in inhibiting inducible nitric oxide synthase.<br>
Various attempts have been made to improve the potency and selectivity of NOS inhibitors by adding one or more rigidifying elements to the inhibitor's structure. Publications by Y. Lee et al (Bioorg. Med. Chem. 7, 1097 (1999)) and R. J. Young et al (Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 10, 597 (2000)) teach that imposing conformational rigidity with one or more carbon-carbon double bonds is not a favorable approach to impart selectivity for NOS inhibitors. Summary of the Invention<br>
Compounds have now been found which have the advantage of being very efficacious in the human cartilage explant assay, a model for osteoarthritis.<br>
The present invention demonstrates that a carbon-carbon double bond can be used as a rigidifying element, and the resulting compounds have unexpected potency and selectivity for inhibition of inducible NOS.<br>
Moreover, the publication by Y. Lee et al (Bioorg. Med. Chem. 7,1097 (1999)) teaches that when a carbon-carbon double bond is used to constrain the arginine backbone, the geometric isomer placing the carbon framework in a cis or Z orientation produces a less favorable interaction with NOS. In contrast, olefinic derivatives of arginine placing the carbon framework in the trans or E configuration are better substrates. The present invention demonstrates that a carbon-carbon double bond imparts a favorable interaction with inducible NOS, such that the resulting compounds have unexpected potency and selectivity for inhibition of inducible NOS over the constitutive isoforms.<br>
Further, compounds of the present invention have the advantage of being very efficacious as iNOS inhibitors in the human cartilage explant assay, a model for osteoarthritis. At the same time the compounds of the present invention are surprisingly less able to penetrate certain non-target organs in test systems, especially in comparison to the compounds of WO 93/13055. This surprising differentiation in expected access between the target organ (cartilage) and other organs is an unexpected advantage for the compounds of the present invention.<br>

The term "alkyl", alone or in combination, means an acyclic aliphatic radical, linear or branched, preferably containing from 1 to about 10 carbon atoms and more preferably containing from 1 to about 6 carbon atoms. Alkyl radicals can be optionally substituted with groups as defined below. Examples of such radicals include methyl, ethyl, chloroethyl, hydroxyethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, cyanobutyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl, tert-butyl, pentyl, aminopentyl, iso-amyl, hexyl, octyl and the like.<br>
The term "alkenyl" refers to an unsaturated, acyclic hydrocarbon radical, linear or branched, in so much as it contains at least one double bond. Such radicals containing from 2 to about 6 carbon atoms, preferably from 2 to about 4 carbon atoms, more preferably from 2 to about 3 carbon atoms. Alkenyl radicals may be optionally substituted with groups as defined below. Examples of suitable alkenyl radicals include propenyl, 2-chloropropylenyl, buten-1-yl, isobutenyl, penten-1-yl, 2-methylbuten-1-yl, 3-methy]buten-l-yl, hexen-1-yl, 3-hydroxyhexen-l-yl, hepten-1-yl, and octen-1-yl, and the like.<br>

The term "oxo" means a doubly bonded oxygen.<br>
The term "alkoxy" means a radical comprising an alkyl radical that is bonded to an oxygen atom, such as a methoxy radical. More preferred alkoxy radicals are "lower alkoxy" radicals having one to about ten carbon atoms. Still<br><br>
more preferred alkoxy radicals have one to about six carbon atoms. Non-limiting xamples of such radicals incliude methoxy, ethoxy, propoxy, isopropoxy, butoxy and tert-butoxy.<br>
The phrase "optionally substituted" means that the indicated radical may, but need not be substituted for hydrogen. Thus, the phrase "optionally substituted by one or more" means that tf a substitution is made at the indicated moiety, more than one substitution is cont
Although nitrogen pirotecting groups are illustratively shown as , t-butoxycarbonyl, or 'BOC, any suitable nitrogen protecting group could be substituted in the synthesis of the compounds of the present invention. Numerous protected amino groups useiul in the present invention for are described by Theodora W. Greene and Peter G.M. Wuts (Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 3rd ed., John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, 1999, pp. 494-653). For example NZ can be a 4-chloroben2ylimino gioup. In one embodiment of the present invention, the protected amino group is any such group resulting from the reaction of an aldehyde with the corresponding amino group to form a Schiff base. A large variety of deprotecting reagents can be advantageously used in the present invention to effect the conversion of the interraiediate to the desired compound. Many such deprotecting reagents are described by Greene and Wuts, supra. For example, when the protected amino group is a 4-chlorobenzylimino group or a t-butoxycarbonylamino group, preferably the deprotecting reagent is an acid. Some useful acid deprotecting agents include, without limitation, hydrochloric acid.<br><br>
hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, trifluoroacetic acid, phosphoric acid, phosphorus acid, and acetic acid.<br>
When a compound is described by both a structure and a name, the name is intended to correspond to the indicated structure, and similarly the structure is intended to correspond with the indicated name.<br>
The term "Combination therapy" means the administration of two or more therapeutic agents to treat a therapeutic condition or disorder described in the present disclosure, for example atherosclerosis, pain, inflammation, migraine, neoplasia, angiogenisis-related conditions or disorder, or other indicated conditions. Such administration encompasses co-administration of two or more therapeutic agents in a substantially simultaneous manner, such as in a single capsule (or other delivery means) having a :fixed ratio of active ingredients or in multiple, separate capsules ( or other delivery means) for each active ingredient. In addition, such administration also encompasses use of each type of therapeutic agent in a sequential manner. In either case, the treatment regimen will provide beneficial effects of the drag combination in treating the conditions or disorders described herein.<br>
The phrase "therapeutically effective" in the context of combination therapy is intended to qualify the combined amount of active ingredients in the combination therapy. This combined sunount will achieve the goal of reducing or eliminating the indicated condition, or alleviating the symptoms of the indicated condition. Illustrative Examples<br>

Biological Data<br>
Some or all of the following assays are used to demonstrate the nitric oxide synthase inhibitory activity' of the invention's compounds as well as demonstrate the useful pharmacological pK)perdes.<br>
Citmlline Assay for Nitric Oxide Synthase<br>
Nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity can be measured by monitoring the conversion of L-[2,3-'H]-arginine to L-[23-'H]-citrulline (Bredt and Snyder, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., J!7,682-685,1990 and Moore et al, J. Med. Chem., 39, 669-672,1996). Human inducible NOS (hiNOS), human endothelial constitutive NOS (hecNOS) and human neuronal constitutive NOS (hncNOS) are each cloned from RNA extracted from human tissue. The cDNA for human inducible NOS (hiNOS) is isolated from a XcDNA library made from RNA extracted from a colon sample from a patient with; ulcerative colitis. The cDNA for human endothelial constitutive NOS (hecNOS) is isolated from a XcDNA library made from RNA extracted from human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and the cDNA for himian neuronal constitutive NOS (hncNOS) is isolated from a XcDNA library made from RNA extracted from human cerebellum obtained from a cadaver. The recombinant enzymes are expressed in S&amp; insect cells using a baculovirus vector (Rodi et al, in The Biology of Nitric Oxide, Ft. 4: Enzvmology, Biochemistry and Immunology: Moncada, S.,, Feelisch, M., Busse, R., Higgs, E., Eds.; Portland Press Ltd.: London, 1995; pp 447-450).  Enzyme activity is isolated from soluble cell extracts and partially purified by DEAE-Sepharose chromatography. To measure NOS activity, 10 JLIL of enzyme is added to 40 ptL of 50 mM Tris (pH 7,6) in the presence or absence of test compounds and the reaction initiated by the addition of<br><br>
50 /iL of a reaction mixture containing 50mM Tris (pH 7.6), 2.0 mg/mL bovine serum albumin, 2.0 mM DTI\ 4.0 mM CaCl2,20 fiM FAD, 100 fiM<br>
tetrahydrobiopterin, 0.4 mM NADPH and 60 /xM Lrarginine containing 0.9 /iCi of<br>
3<br>
L-[2,3- H]-arginine. The final concentration of L-arginine in the assay is 30 /xM. For hecNOS or hncNOS, cahnodulin is included at a final concentration of 40-100 nM. Following incubation at 37°C for 15 minutes, the reaction is teraiinated by addition of 400 fiL of a suspension (1 part resin, 3 parts buffer) of Dowex SOW X-8 cation exchange resin (sodium form) in a stop buffer containing 10 mM EGTA, 100 mM HEPES, pH 5.5 and 1 niM L-citrulline. After mixing the resin is allowed to settle andL-[2,3-'H]-Citralline formation is determined by counting aliquots of the supernatant with a liquid scintillation counter. IC50 values can be determined by testing each compound at several concentrations. Results are reported in Table I as the IC50 values of compounds for hiNOS, hecNOS and hncNOS.<br><br>
In Vivo Assay<br>
Rats can be treated with an intraperitoneal injection of 1-12.5 mg/kg of endotoxin (LPS) to induce systemic expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase, resulting in markedly elevatedl plasma nitrite/nitrate levels. Compounds are administered orally 0.5-1 houi-s prior to LPS administration and plasma nitrite/nitrate levels are detemiined 5 hours following LPS administration. The results can be used to show that the administration of the nitric oxide synthase inhibitors decreases the rise in plasma nitrite/nitrate levels, a reliable indicator of<br><br>
the production of nitric oxide induced by endotoxin. ED50 values (mg/kg) for<br>
inhibition of the LPS-induce;d increase in plasma nitrite/nitrate levels are shown in Table H.<br><br>
Raw Cell Nitrite Assay<br>
RAW 264,7 cells cam be plated to confluency on a 96-well tissue culture plate grown overnight (17h) in the presence of LPS to induce NOS. A row of 3-6 wells can be left untreated and serve as controls for subtraction of nonspecific background. The media can be removed from each well and the cells washed twice with Kreb-Ringers-Hepes (25 mM, pH 7.4) with 2 mg/ml glucose. The cells are then placed on ice and incubated with 50 fiL of buffer containing L-arginine (30 /xM) +/" inhibitors for Ih. The assay can be initiated by warming the plate to 37° C in a water bath for Ih. Production of nitrite by intracellular INOS will be linear with time. To terminate the cellular assay, the plate of cells can be placed on ice and the nitrite-containing Ituffer removed and analyzed for nitrite using a previously published fluorescent deteimination for nitrite (T. P. Misko et al. Analytical Biochemistry, 214,11-16,1993).<br>

Bone pieces are rinsed twice with Dulbecco's Phosphate Buffered Saline (GibcoBRL) and once witli Dulbecco's Modified Eagles Medium (GibcoBRL) and placed into a petri dish wilii phenol red free Minimum Essential Medium (MEM) (GibcoBRL). Cartilage wais cut into small explants of approximately 15-45 mg in<br><br>
weight and one or two explaiits per well are placed into either 96 or 48 well culture<br>
plates with 200- of culture media per well. The culture media was either a<br>
custom modification of Minimum Essential Medium(Eagle) with Earle's salts<br>
(GibcoBRL) prepared without L-Arginine, without L-Glutamine and without phenol<br>
red or a custom modification of serumless Neuman and Tytell (GibcoBRL)<br>
medium prepared without L-arginine, without insulin, without ascorbic acid,<br>
without L-glutamine and witiiiout phenol red. Both are supplemented before use<br>
with 100 fiM L-Arginine (Sii'ma), 2 mM L-glutamine, IX HL-1 supplement<br>
(BioWhittaker), 50 mg/ml ascorbic acid (Sigma) and 150 pg/ml recombinant	,<br>
human IL-ip (RD Systems) l;o induce nitric oxide synthase. Compounds are then added in 10 fiL aliquots and the explants incubated at 37° C with 5% CO2 for 18-24 hours.<br>
The day old supernatant is then discarded and replaced with fresh culture media containing recombinant human IL-ip and compound and incubated for another 20-24 hours. This supernatant is analyzed for nitrite with a fluorometric assay (Misko et al, Anal. Biochem.. 214,11-16,1993). All samples are done in quadruplicate. Unstimulated controls are cultured in media in the absence of recombinant human IL-lp. IC50 values (Table ID) are determined fi'om plotting the percent inhibition of mtrite, production at six different concentrations of inhibitor.<br><br>
