CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION<br>
[0001] This application claims the benefit of both prior U.S. Provisional Application<br>
Serial No. 60/932,741 filed June 4, 2007 and of prior U.S. Provisional Application<br>
Serial No. 60/959,459 filed July 13, 2007.<br>
GOVERNMENT LICENSE RIGHTS<br>
[0002] The present invention was made at least in part with Government support<br>
under Contract No. DE-FC36-04GO14000, awarded by the United States Department of<br>
Energy. The Government may have certain rights in the invention.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0003] The invention relates generally to the determination of an electric motor's<br>
operating efficiency while the motor is running without the need for any additional<br>
sensors, other than standard current and voltage sensors on the input side of the motor.<br>
[0004] Motor-driven systems are generally believed to use a majority of the total<br>
electric energy produced. Of the total number of motor-driven systems in use, only a<br>
small fraction have their efficiency and health monitored. Due to the costs of<br>
conventional monitoring systems, the motor-driven systems that are monitored are often<br>
the costlier motors above 500 hp. However, motors below 200 hp make up a majority<br>
of the motors in service and consume a majority of the energy used by all motors in<br>
service. Further, these motors of 200 hp or below often operate at no more than 60% of<br>
their rated load because of oversized installations and/or under-loaded conditions.<br>
Consequently, many motors operate at a reduced efficiency, which results in wasted<br>
energy. Without an efficiency monitoring system, the wasted energy that results from a<br>
motor operating inefficiently often goes unnoticed. Accordingly, often the first step<br>
towards maximizing energy efficiency of a motor is to determine or measure the<br>
efficiency of the motor.<br>
[0005] Systems for energy usage monitoring or efficiency evaluation of electric<br>
machines are important for overall energy savings. These systems are often expected to<br>
be implemented in an integrated product because of many common requirements such<br>
as data collections. At a fundamental level, energy efficiency of a motor can be<br>
determined by the ratio of a motor's power input to the motor's power output. Motor<br>
terminal voltages and currents are often used to determine a motor's power input. In<br>
industrial plants, the motor terminal voltages and currents are readily available from<br>
motor control centers (MCCs) that have potential transformers (PTs) and current<br>
transformers (CTs) preinstalled for protection purposes. Because of the PTs and CTs<br>
that are often preinstalled in MCCs, to measure terminal voltages and currents often<br>
brings no additional costs in terms of added sensors for data collection. As such,<br>
conventional efficiency monitoring systems often rely on the terminal voltages and<br>
currents as measured by the MCCs to determine input power. However, many<br>
traditional efficiency evaluation methods or monitoring systems also require the<br>
measurement of motor rotor speed and motor shaft torque so that motor output power<br>
may be calculated. Speed and torque transducers are commonly used to directly<br>
measure the motor rotor speed and shaft torque. However, such transducers pose<br>
problems because they add expenses in added hardware and costly installations that are<br>
highly intrusive requiring motor down-time, which is unacceptable in many industrial<br>
applications.<br>
[0006] Further, it may not even be possible to install such transducers, or other<br>
measuring equipment, because either the motors are buried and inaccessible inside a<br>
machine or there is no space to attach such transducers between the motor and the load.<br>
As such, methods have been developed in which motors are taken offline or removed<br>
from service so that power output may be determined. Often, the motors are removed to<br>
a remote room where testing is implemented in a controlled environment. However,<br>
because many industrial processes cannot be interrupted, traditional methods that<br>
require a motor be removed from service to determine its efficiency cannot be used.<br>
[0007] A possible approach of evaluating motor efficiency, while keeping a motor<br>
in-service or online and avoiding the use of output transducers, is to use the pre-<br>
measured motor characteristic efficiencies for representative load conditions. Such<br>
efficiencies are often measured during motor development, and are used to predict the<br>
motor efficiency while the motor is in operation, or while in-service. This approach is<br>
nonintrusive in nature; however, its usage in practice is greatly limited by the fact that<br>
1) the characteristic efficiencies under representative load conditions are not always<br>
available from motor data sheets, and 2) the characteristic efficiencies are generic data<br>
for a line of motors. Being generic, such information could differ from actual<br>
efficiencies for a specific motor due to many factors, such as winding characteristics,<br>
wide tolerances, inaccurate nameplate information, and different working environments,<br>
to name just a few reasons.<br>
[0008] Therefore, it would be desirable to design an apparatus and method to non-<br>
intrusively and accurately determine motor efficiency while such motor is in-service,<br>
without the need for any add-on sensors.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0009] In accordance with one aspect of the invention, a motor efficiency<br>
determination system includes a processor programmed to determine a plurality of<br>
stator input currents of a motor in operation, determine electrical input data of the motor<br>
in operation, determine a rotor speed of the motor in operation, determine a value of<br>
stator resistance of the motor in operation, and determine an efficiency of the motor in<br>
operation. The determination of the rotor speed is based on one of the input power and<br>
the plurality of stator input currents. The determination of the value of the stator<br>
resistance is based on at least one of a horsepower rating and a combination of the<br>
plurality of stator input currents with the electrical input data. The electrical input data<br>
includes at least one of an input power and a plurality of stator input voltages. In<br>
addition, the determination of the efficiency of the motor in operation is based on the<br>
determined rotor speed, the determined value of stator resistance, the plurality of stator<br>
input currents, and the determined electrical input data.<br>
[0010] In accordance with another aspect of the invention, a computer readable<br>
storage medium having stored thereon a computer program comprising instructions,<br>
which, when executed by a computer, cause the computer to measure at least two stator<br>
input currents of an electric motor during an electric motor operation, measure at least<br>
one of an input power and a plurality of stator input voltages of the electric motor<br>
during the motor operation, and determine an instantaneous efficiency of the electric<br>
motor during the motor operation. The determination of the instantaneous efficiency is<br>
based on a rotor speed, a determination of a stator winding resistance, and the at least<br>
two stator input currents. The determination of the stator winding resistance is based on<br>
data free of measured stator winding resistance data.<br>
[0011] In accordance with yet another aspect of the invention, a method of<br>
determining an instantaneous motor efficiency of an online motor in operation includes<br>
determining an input power of an online motor in operation, determining a rotor speed<br>
of the online motor in operation, and determining a stator winding resistance of the<br>
online motor in operation without measuring the stator winding resistance. The method<br>
further includes determining an output power of the online motor in operation based on<br>
the rotor speed and the stator winding resistance and determining an instantaneous<br>
motor efficiency of the online motor in operation based on the determination of the<br>
input power and the determination of the output power.<br>
[0012] Various other features and advantages will be made apparent from the<br>
following detailed description and the drawings.<br>

motor efficiency set forth in FIG. 2 according to an embodiment of the invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
[0020] Referring to FIG. 1, a block diagram of a system incorporating the present<br>
invention is shown. The system 10 includes a motor 12 that receives power from a<br>
power supply 14. The system 10 also includes a relay assembly 16 used to monitor as<br>
well as control operation of the motor in response to operator inputs or motor fault<br>
conditions. The motor 12 and the relay assembly 16 typically are coupled to electronic<br>
devices such as a power controller and/or a starter 17. The controller/starter 17 is<br>
connected to the motor 12. It is contemplated, however, that the power controller/starter<br>
may be connected in series between the power supply 14 and the motor 12. In a three-<br>
phase system, as shown in FIG. 1, the relay assembly 16 includes a processor 18 that, as<br>
will be described in greater detail with respect to FIGS. 2-5, determines motor<br>
efficiency while the motor 12 is in operation (i.e., operating online). Though the<br>
processor 18 is depicted as being included in the relay assembly 16, it is contemplated<br>
that a power control device such as the power controller/starter 17 may include the<br>
processor 18. The relay assembly 16 includes at least a pair of voltage sensors 20 and a<br>
pair of current sensors 22. As is generally known, voltage and current data may be<br>
acquired from only two of the phases of a three-phase motor as voltage and current data<br>
for the third phase may be extrapolated from the voltage and current data of the<br>
monitored two phases.<br>
[0021] It is contemplated that embodiments of the invention may be implemented<br>
using a standalone monitoring and diagnostic unit such as the relay assembly 16 of FIG.<br>
1 that includes the processor 18. However, it is also contemplated that embodiments of<br>
the invention may be implemented by using existing processors and sensors of a motor<br>
control center (MCC).<br>
[0022] Referring to FIG. 2, a flowchart depicting a technique for a nonintrusive<br>
determination of motor efficiency according to one aspect of the invention is shown. In<br>
one embodiment, a plurality of input voltages and currents of the motor's stator are<br>
determined or measured while the motor is operating 100. For example, input currents<br>
and voltages may be determined using sensors at the input terminals of the motor, or at<br>
any convenient location upstream of the motor so as to easily acquire the input voltages<br>
and currents using sensors already in place. In yet another example, the input voltages<br>
and currents may be determined by using detectors or sensors to determine line-to-line<br>
voltages (e.g., see voltage sensors 20 and current sensors 22 of FIG. 1). Often,<br>
however, MCCs can be used to determine input voltages and currents using the potential<br>
transformers (PTs) and currents transformers (CTs) incorporated therein. Accordingly,<br>
if such an MMC is connected to a motor, voltage and current inputs can be gathered or<br>
determined therefrom.<br>
[0023] In another embodiment, input power and one of a plurality of stator input<br>
voltages or input currents are determined or measured at 100, FIG. 2. That is, if a<br>
plurality of stator input voltages are determined, one skilled in the art will appreciate<br>
that the determined or measured input power may be used to determine the plurality of<br>
stator input currents. Likewise, if a plurality stator input currents are determined, one<br>
skilled in the art will appreciate that the determined or measure input power may be<br>
used to determine the plurality of stator input voltages.<br>
[0024] Still referring to FIG. 2, after the determinations or measurements at 100,<br>
process control proceeds to determining rotor speed at 102. It is noted that, such rotor<br>
speed is determined while the motor is operating and online. Further, it is also noted<br>
that the rotor speed is determined using the determined or gathered input currents and<br>
motor or electrical input data such as voltages or a determined or gathered input power<br>
- not by using any speed transducers or other invasive devices.<br>
[0025] In one embodiment, the rotor speed is determined, 102, using determined<br>
input voltages and currents and is based on current harmonics. That is, the<br>
determination at 102 may be based on the motor magnetic saliency harmonics, which<br>
arise from rotor slotting and eccentricity. For example, an initialization algorithm, as<br>
understood by those skilled in the art, may be used for determining the number of rotor<br>
slots and for determining an optimal set of numbers for k, air-gap MMF harmonics<br>
order, and an order of rotor eccentricity for the following equation:<br>
<br>
where fseh is the frequency of rotor-related harmonic components; f1 is the supply<br>
frequency; k= 0, 1, 2, ...; R is the number of rotor slots;P is the number of poles; s is<br>
the motor slip; nd = 0, ±1, ±2, ..., is the order of rotor eccentricity; and nw = ±1, ±3, ...,<br>
is the air-gap MMF harmonics order. An example of an overall signal processing<br>
algorithm, which may used to determine the slot harmonic frequency,fseh, is illustrated<br>
in the signal processing diagram of FIG. 3. After determining k, nd, and nw, a speed<br>
detection algorithm may use the following relationship to determine rotor speed:<br>
<br>
Here, the slip determination is independent of motor parameters, only requiring the<br>
number of poles, which may be obtained a priori. Such a determination provides a<br>
robust speed estimate down to approximately 1 Hz operation with a very high accuracy<br>
of within 5 rpm at high speeds and 0.005 p.u. slip at low speeds.<br>
[0026] In another embodiment, the rotor speed, ?r, of a motor may determined, 102,<br>
FIG. 2, using a determined or calculated input power and nameplate data information<br>
according to the following relationship:<br>
<br>
where ?syn is the motor synchronous speed, ? r_rated is the rated motor speed that may<br>
be determined from motor nameplate information, and Load _ per is the instantaneous<br>
load percentage. ?syn may be determined from the following relationship:<br>
<br>
where p , which may be determined from nameplate data, is the motor pole number,<br>
and f1 is, as with Eqn. 1, the fundamental frequency of the supply. Load _ per, as<br>
used in Eqn. 3, may be determined from the following relationship:<br>
<br>
where Pinput may be determined from data gathered from an input power meter.<br>
Pinput_rated as seen in Eqn. 3, may be determined in accordance with the following<br>
relationship:<br>
<br>
where HPrated and nraled is the rated output power and the rated motor efficiency,<br>
respectively, and each may also be determined from nameplate data. Alternatively,<br>
P , raled may also be determined according to the following relationship:<br>
<br>
where VLL_rated represents the rated line-to-line input voltage determined from motor<br>
nameplate, Is_rated represents rated input phase current or Full Load Current determined<br>
from motor nameplate, and PFrated represents the rated motor power factor, also<br>
determined from motor nameplate data.<br>
[0027] Accordingly, in light of Eqns. 3-7, the instantaneous motor speed, ?r, may<br>
be determined from only nameplate data and a determined motor input power, Pinput.<br>
Other sensorless speed determinations that employ other techniques may be used in a<br>
manner consistent with embodiments of the invention.<br>
[0028] As discussed above, rotor speed determinations may be made without a speed<br>
sensor. It is contemplated, however, that a speed sensor may be used to determine rotor<br>
speed. As such, a rotor speed determination such as the one discussed above with<br>
respect to Eqns. 1 and 2 may be used to verify a rotor speed determined from a sensor.<br>
[0029] Referring back to FIG. 2, upon determining rotor speed, without speed<br>
transducers or other invasive devices, process control proceeds to determine an average<br>
stator resistance of the three-phase motor at 104 while the motor is operating (i.e., while<br>
in-service or online). That is, a stator resistance for each phase of the three-phase motor<br>
is determined and then the three stator resistances are averaged to create the determined<br>
average stator resistance. Traditionally, a direct current resistance of a stator winding is<br>
measured through an unpowered test. However, according to at least one embodiment<br>
of the invention, direct current resistance of a stator winding can be determined while a<br>
motor remains powered. That is, according to this embodiment, an average stator<br>
resistance may be determined while the motor is in operation. An average stator<br>
resistance determination may be determined in a variety of ways. For example, in one<br>
embodiment, an injection circuit is utilized, where a solid state device such as a<br>
MOSFET controlled circuit is used to intermittently inject a controllable direct current<br>
bias into the motor, thus allowing the determination of stator resistance for each phase.<br>
An equivalent circuit structure of such a MOSFET controlled circuit is shown in FIG. 4.<br>
Such an embodiment allows for low power dissipation and torque distortion, and is<br>
capable of providing an accurate average stator resistance determination under motor<br>
startup, load variation, and abnormal cooling conditions. Further, in such an<br>
embodiment, the injection circuit can be installed in the MCC for mains-fed machines.<br>
Upon determining stator resistance with regard to each phase of a three-phase motor, an<br>
average of the three can be taken to determine the average stator resistance.<br>
[0030] Still referring to FIG. 2, when drive-connected motors are used, another<br>
embodiment may be employed to determine average stator resistance at 104. As is<br>
known in the art, with drive-connected motors, an injection circuit is not needed since<br>
direct current signal injection can be implemented in a software mode by controlling the<br>
excitation signals. As such, by controlling excitation signals, an average stator<br>
resistance can be determined from induced direct-current components in the input<br>
voltages and/or currents.<br>
[0031] Another embodiment for determining average stator resistance during motor<br>
operation without a direct-current signal injection circuit will now be described. For<br>
many alternating current motors, which are connected with, for example, drives, soft-<br>
starters, and advanced relays, such an additional signal injection device can be<br>
eliminated by non-intrusively determining stator resistance for each phase. In such an<br>
embodiment, stator resistance may be determined by injecting direct-current<br>
components in the motor stator winding by adjusting the switching of the semiconductor<br>
devices of motors, such as a thyristor, MOSFET, or IGBT. As such, the direct-current<br>
injection circuit may be eliminated. Upon determining stator resistance for each phase,<br>
an average stator resistance can be estimated or determined.<br>
[0032] In the embodiment depicted in the flowchart of FIG. 2, the rotor speed<br>
determination, 102, precedes the average stator resistance determination, 104. It is<br>
contemplated, however, that the rotor speed could be determined anytime after the<br>
determination of input voltages and currents, 100, and before the motor efficiency<br>
determination, which will be described in greater detail below, at 108.<br>
[0033] Still referring to FIG. 2, after the determinations at 104 are complete, process<br>
control proceeds to determining no-load data at 106. No load data includes no-load<br>
current and no-load losses. Further, the no-load losses include windage and friction<br>
losses and stray-load loss. As will be described more fully below, the invention is<br>
capable of determining motor efficiencies for three-phase motors using determined no-<br>
load input current, measured input currents, and measured input voltages.<br>
[0034] No-load input current may be determined at 106 in a variety ways. For<br>
example, no-load input current can be measured when a motor is operating under a no-<br>
load condition. On the other hand, however, no-load current may be estimated as a<br>
fixed percentage of the motor nominal current (e.g. 25%-30% of the nominal current)<br>
for small and medium motors (e.g., motors less than 200 horsepower). For larger<br>
motors, the percentage is often lower.<br>
[0035] No-load current may also be determined using a priori data from a source<br>
such as the Motor Master Database data maintained by the United States Department of<br>
Energy or other databases. As such, no-load current may be determined at 106 either<br>
via measurement or by using a priori database information.<br>
[0036] In yet another embodiment, no-load input current may be determined from<br>
the no-load losses using the following relationship:<br>
<br>
where Pinput_nl is the no-load loss that is estimated, as shown, as a fixed percentage of<br>
the rated output power (e.g. 3.5%-4.2% of the rated output power per the Ontario Hydro<br>
Modified Method E), and HP is the rated motor output horsepower.<br>
[0037] With regard to the no-load losses that are included in the determination of no-<br>
load data at 106, friction and windage losses, Wfw, may be estimated as a fixed<br>
percentage of the rated output power (e.g. 1.2% of the rated output power), as shown in<br>
the following relationship:<br>
<br>
[0038] Further, the rated stray-load loss, WLL_rated, may be estimated, according to<br>
IEEE standard 112, as a fixed percentage of the rated output power as shown below in<br>
the Table 1.<br>
<br>
[0039] As shown above, losses are often based on a fixed percentage of the motor<br>
horsepower rating. Horsepower ratings may be found in a variety of databases or may<br>
be gathered from nameplate data.<br>
[0040] Still further, as will be shown below with respect to Eqns. 10 and 11, rotor<br>
stray-load loss, WLLr, may be determined from the motor stator input no-load current,<br>
Is_nl, rated rotor current, Ir_rated, and rotor current, Ir. Before discussing the<br>
determination of WLLr, examples for determining each variable will be described below.<br>
[0041] With regard to the motor stator input no load current, Is_nl, upon determining<br>
Pinput_nl, Wfw, and WLL_rated, the root mean square (RMS) value of the motor stator input<br>
no-load current, Is_nl, may be estimated or determined according to the following<br>
relationship:<br>
<br>
where, Rs is the stator resistance value that may be determined from a variety of motor<br>
databases, or from the motor voltage and current (e.g., see determination of average<br>
stator resistance at 104).<br>
[0042] The rated rotor current, Ir_rated, which may be used to determine the rotor<br>
stray-load loss, may be estimated or determined using rated input current, Israted, and the<br>
input stator no-load current Is_„i, according to the following relationship:<br>
<br>
[0043] In addition, the rotor current, Ir, which also may be used to determine the<br>
rotor stray-load loss, may be estimated or determined under any load condition using the<br>
input current, Is, and the stator no-load current Is_ni, according to the following<br>
relationship:<br>
<br>
[0044] As such, with the understanding that WLL_rated, discussed above with respect<br>
to Table 1, is often estimated to be equivalent to the rated rotor stray-load loss,<br>
WLLr_rated, the rotor stray-load loss, Wlu-, may be determined at any load condition<br>
according to the following relationship:<br>
<br>
[0045] Accordingly, the determination of no-load data at 106 may include the<br>
determination of windage and friction loss, W/w, and rotor stray-load loss, WLLr.<br>
[0046] As depicted in the embodiment of FIG. 2 the determination of no-load data,<br>
106, occurs after the determination of the stator resistance at 104. It is contemplated,<br>
however, that the no-load data, 106, could be determined before the determination of<br>
stator resistance, 104. That is, if a stator resistance determination is not used in the<br>
determination of no-load data, the determination of no-load data, 106, may occur prior<br>
to the determination of stator resistance, 104, and after the determination of input<br>
voltages and currents at 100.<br>
[0047] As mentioned above, the determination of motor efficiency occurs at 108 in<br>
the embodiment of FIG. 2. Such an efficiency estimation or determination is considered<br>
an instantaneous motor efficiency determination. In one embodiment, the following<br>
relationship may be used to determine motor efficiency at 108:<br>
<br>
where 77 is motor efficiency, Poulpul is the power output of the motor, and P is the<br>
power input of the motor. In one embodiment that will be discussed below with respect<br>
to FIG. 5, the motor efficiency determination of 108 is based on an air-gap torque<br>
technique. In light of the manner in which the motor power input and motor power<br>
output may be determined, motor efficiency may be estimated without any output<br>
sensing devices.<br>
[0048] Referring now to FIG. 5, a flowchart depicts technique 119 for the in-service<br>
or online determination of motor efficiency 108 according to an embodiment of the<br>
invention. More particularly, an air-gap torque technique 119 for determining a motor<br>
efficiency is shown. According to technique 119, the number of poles of the motor is<br>
determined from a priori information at 120. Upon determining the number of motor<br>
poles at 120, process control proceeds to determine the air-gap torque of the motor, 122.<br>
In one embodiment, the determination of the air-gap torque at 122 is based on<br>
determined average stator resistances, as in step 104 of FIG. 2, the number of motor<br>
poles, as in step 120 of FIG. 5, and/or the determined or measured input voltages and<br>
currents, as in step 100 of FIG. 2.<br>
[0049] The invention may determine the air-gap torque for all three-phase motors<br>
with three wires, or all three-phase motors with four wires, where a fourth wire is a<br>
neutral wire. The air-gap torque, Tag, for the directly above-mentioned three-phase<br>
motors, can be derived as follows:<br>
<br>
where Adqs is the total flux linkage space vector and idqs is the stator current space<br>
vector in the d-q system. As such, the air-gap torque, Tag, can be determined using the<br>
following relationship in the 3-phase system:<br>
<br>
where p is the number of poles determined at 120 of FIG. 5. Further, Rs represents the<br>
determined average stator resistance, 104 of FIG. 2. As evident from Eqn. 16, when Rs<br>
is found, Tag may be determined using only two voltage sensors (e.g., voltage sensors 20<br>
of FIG. 1) and two current sensors (e.g., current sensors 22 of FIG. 1). The integrals in<br>
Eqn. 16 represent the corresponding flux linkages. Further, as seen in Eqn. 16, the<br>
determination of the air-gap torque is free of phasor computations. In addition, since<br>
the sampling frequency of motor voltages and currents is usually large (greater than 2<br>
kHz), a simple trapezoidal integration method can be used. Other numerical integration<br>
methods, e.g. Simpson's rules, can also be applied.<br>
[0050] Upon or during determination of the air-gap torque at 122, process control<br>
then determines motor efficiency at 124. In one embodiment, as mentioned above with<br>
respect to Eqn. 14, motor efficiency is equivalent to the ratio of motor power output to<br>
motor power input. Motor power input may, for example, be determined from a power<br>
meter or the like. In another example, motor power input may be determined according<br>
to the following relationship:<br>
<br>
where vca and vafc'may be determined using motor terminal voltage detectors, line-to-<br>
line voltage detectors, or the like. Likewise, ia and ib may be determined using motor<br>
terminal current detectors, line current detectors, or the like. The motor power output,<br>
on the other hand, may be determined or estimated using the following relationship:<br>
<br>
where Tshafl is the motor shaft torque and cor is the rotor speed (see Eqns. 1-2 and 3-7).<br>
The motor shaft torque, Tshafl, may be determined using the following relationship:<br>
<br>
In light of Eqns. 16-19 above, motor power output can be determined or estimated<br>
according to the following relationship:<br>
<br>
That is, power output may be determined from the determined air-gap torque, T , rotor<br>
speed, cor, and no-load losses (e.g., W^, and WLLr determined at 106). If the motor is of<br>
the permanent magnetic (PM) or synchronous type, the rotor stay-load loss, WLLr, can<br>
be considered to go to zero. Otherwise, if applicable, WLLr and W^ may be determined<br>
from nameplate information or other accessible resources as discussed above with<br>
respect to 106, and Tag and Q)r may be determined from input voltages and currents as<br>
discussed above.<br>
[0051] Accordingly, by measuring motor power input and determining motor power<br>
output, motor efficiency, rj, may be determined at 124 according to, for example, Eqn.<br>
14. As such, the motor efficiency determination at 124 may be based on input stator<br>
current and voltage and/or power, determined average stator resistance, and a<br>
determined rotor speed. In other words, the motor efficiency may be determined, 124,<br>
from input voltage and current, air-gap torque, and no-load data. Accordingly, it is seen<br>
that in light of the information used to settle Eqns. 1-20 above, motor efficiency can be<br>
determined, 124, merely from nameplate data, input voltage, and input current. As<br>
such, the present invention allows for accurate efficiency determination of a motor in<br>
operation (i.e., online), without any rotor speed or torque sensing devices, or any other<br>
sensing devices that need to be intrusively placed within the motor or on the output of<br>
the motor. If nameplate data, input voltage, and input current are obtained from a motor<br>
control device such as an MCC, the motor efficiency may be determined, 124, remotely.<br>
[0052] A technical contribution for the disclosed method and apparatus is that is<br>
provides for a processor implemented to determine a motor efficiency based on<br>
nonintrusive techniques that rely on measured input current and voltage and a<br>
determination of output power.<br>
[0053] In accordance with one embodiment, a motor efficiency determination system<br>
includes a processor programmed to determine a plurality of stator input currents of a<br>
motor in operation, determine electrical input data of the motor in operation, determine<br>
a rotor speed of the motor in operation, determine a value of stator resistance of the<br>
motor in operation, and determine an efficiency of the motor in operation. The<br>
determination of the rotor speed is based on one of the input power and the plurality of<br>
stator input currents. The determination of the value of the stator resistance is based on<br>
at least one of a horsepower rating and a combination of the plurality of stator input<br>
currents and the electrical input data. The electrical input data includes at least one of<br>
an input power and a plurality of stator input voltages. In addition, the determination of<br>
the efficiency of the motor in operation is based on the determined rotor speed, the<br>
determined value of stator resistance, the plurality of stator input currents, and the<br>
determined electrical input data.<br>
[0054] In accordance with another embodiment, a computer readable storage<br>
medium having stored thereon a computer program comprising instructions, which,<br>
when executed by a computer, cause the computer to measure at least two stator input<br>
currents of an electric motor during an electric motor operation, measure at least one of<br>
an input power and a plurality of stator input voltages of the electric motor during the<br>
motor operation, and determine an instantaneous efficiency of the electric motor during<br>
the motor operation. The determination of the instantaneous efficiency is based on a<br>
rotor speed, a determination of a stator winding resistance, and the at least two stator<br>
input currents. The determination of the stator winding resistance is based on data free<br>
of measured stator winding resistance data.<br>
[0055] In accordance with yet another embodiment, a method of determining an<br>
instantaneous motor efficiency of an online motor in operation includes determining an<br>
input power of an online motor in operation, determining a rotor speed of the online<br>
motor in operation, and determining a stator winding resistance of the online motor in<br>
operation without measuring the stator winding resistance. The method further includes<br>
determining an output power of the online motor in operation based on the rotor speed<br>
and the stator winding resistance and determining an instantaneous motor efficiency of<br>
the online motor in operation based on the determination of the input power and the<br>
determination of the output power.<br>
