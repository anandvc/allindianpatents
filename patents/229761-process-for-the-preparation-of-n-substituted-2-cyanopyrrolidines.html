The present invention relates to a novel process for the preparation of N-(N'-substituted glycyl)-2-cyanopyrroiiciines and a composition obtainable according to the novel process comprising predominantly N-(N'-substituted glycyl)-2(S)-cyanopyrrolidine.<br>
N-(N'-substitutedglycyl)-2-cyanopyrrolidlnes, especially those of formula I<br><br>
wherein R is as defined below; in free form or in acid addition salt form;<br>
are valuable dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV) inhibitors which have been described in WO<br>
98/19998, for example.<br>
The conventional process for preparation of N-(N'-substituted giycyl)-2-cyanopyn'olidines, especially those of formula I above, comprises reacting a halogen (preferably chlorine or bromine) substituted (2-cyanopyrrolidino)carbonylmethylene with an appropriate amine. Said substituted (2-cyanopyrrolidino)carbonylmethylene may be obtained by reacting a haloacetylhalide with L-prolinamide followed by a dehydration with trifluoroacetic anhydride. This process has significant drawbacks, especially when considering industrial production of N-(N'-substituted glycyl)-2-cyanopyn'olidines, as both the 1-haloacetyl-2-cyanopyn'olidine intermediate and its direct precursor are classified as irritant. Furthermore the process needs aqueous work up at several steps resulting in potential waste problems and lower yields. It has also recently been reported an alternative synthesis based on solid phase chemistry which avoids free 1-haloacetyi-2-cyanopyrrolidine but which process is not suitable for scale-up according to its authors (N. Willand et al., Tetrahedron 58 (2002) 5741-5746). Thus, there exists a need for an improved process.<br>
It has now been found that surprisingly the 1-haioacetyl-2-cyanopyrrolidine intermediate may be prepared in such a way that no isolation of said irritant compound is needed. Said compound may therefore be directly further reacted with the appropriate amine. In addition,<br><br>
the new process allows to recycle all solvents and the only by-products are inorganic salts. The new process is characterised by a high overall yield and is suitable for industrial production.<br>
Therefore, an object of the instant invention is the process for the preparation of a N-(N'-substituted glycyl)-2-cyanopyrrolidine comprising at least<br>
(a)	reacting, in the presence of dimethylformamide, a compound of formula (V)<br><br>
with L-prolinamide, followed by<br>
(b)	reacting the resultant compound without isolation with a dehydration agent, optionally<br>
followed by<br>
(c)	reacting, in the presence of a base, the resultant compound without isolation with an appropriate amine and<br>
(d)	recovering the resultant compound in free form or in acid addition salt form.<br>
When X2 is -0-S02-(aryl), the term "aryl" refers to monocyclic or bicyclic aromatic hydrocarbon groups having 6-12 carbon atoms in the ring portion, such as phenyl, biphenyl, naphthyl and tetrahydronaphthyl, each of which may optionally be substituted by 1-4 substituents, such as optionally substituted (Ci.4)alkyl e.g. trifluoromethyl, halo, hydroxy, (Ci. 4)alkoxy, acyl. Preferably the aryl group is a phenyl, or a substituted phenyl.<br>
When X2 is -0-S02-(Ci.8)alkyl or -0-S02-(aryl), the term "alkyl" refers to either straight or branched chain, which may optionally be substituted by 1-5 substituents selected from halogen preferably fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine. Exemplary alkyl groups include methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, f-butyl, isobutyl, trifluoromethyl.<br>
In the above described process, the amine is either a primary or a secondary amine. Such kind of amines useful in organic chemistry, for the synthesis of pharmaceutical compounds<br><br>
are well known by the person skilled In the art. An appropriate amine substituted by one or two organic groups, can be easily selected by the person skilled in the art based on e.g. the structure of the published DPP-IV inhibitors such as in WO 03/002596.<br>

Step (a)<br>
A 1500 ml reactor, equipped with a mechanical stin-er, is charged with 212 g isopropyl-acetate and 19.8 g dimethylformamide. The reactor is inertized. At about IT (internal temperature) 15 °C, 125 g chloroacetylchloride is added within 15 min., after complete addition the IT is adjusted to about 15 °C, and a solution of 110 g L-prolinamide in 304 g dimethylformamide is added within 1 h. The addition funnel is rinsed with 18 g isopropyl-acetate. The reaction mixture Is warmed to about IT 35 °C for 1.5 h.<br>
Step (b)<br>
After cooling to about 15 °C 142 g Vilsmeier reagent is added in portions. The reaction<br>
mixture is stirred for 1 h at about IT 25 °C. At IT max. 25 °C 4.4 g water is added.<br>
Step (c)<br>
A 4.5 I reactor, equipped with a mechanical stirrer, is charged with 733 g of potassium carbonate, 194 g 3-hydroxyaminoadamantane, 8.0 g potassium iodide and 880 g 2-butanone. The suspension is heated to about 35 °C. At this temperature 937 g solution of step b) (crude (S)-1-chloroacetyl-pyrrolidine-2-carbonltriie) is added within 1.5 h. The addition funnel is rinsed with 20 g 2-butanone. After stirring for an additional 1 h, the suspension is warmed to about IT 70 °C for 30 min. The warm suspension is filtered and the filter cake is rinsed three times with warm 331 g 2-butanone. The filtrate is concentrated at about JT (jacket temperature) 60 °C under reduced pressure (about 20 mbar).<br>
Step (d)<br>
At about JT 60 °C 8.8 g 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene and 44 g isopropanol is added and stirred for 30 min. at IT about 60 °C. The resulting suspension is cooled to about IT 40 °C and at JT 40 °C 814 g t-butylmethylether is added. The suspension is cooled to about IT 20 °C and stirred for at least 2 h at this temperature, then cooled to about -10°C - 0 °C, stirred for 1 h and filtered. The filtration "cake" is washed twice with 168 g of a cold (about -10 °C)<br><br>
1:1 (v:v) mixture of isopropanol and t-butylmethylether. The crude product (247 g) is dried under reduced pressure at about JT 55 °C.<br>

Purification of Pyrrolidine, 1-[(3-hydroxy-1-adamantyl)amino]acetyl-2-cyano-, (S):<br>
A 750 ml reactor, equipped with a mechanical stin-er, is charged with 199 g of crude 1 -[(3-hydroxy-adamant-1-ylamino)-acetyl]-pyrrolidine-2(S)-carbonitrile), 800 g 2-butanone. The mixture is heated to reflux (JT 95 °C) and stirred for 15 min. The mixture is filtered into a warm (JT 75 °C) reactor, the filter cake is washed with 80 g 2-butanone. The IT is adjusted to 70 °C and 0.18 g (1-[(3-hydroxy-adamant-1-ylamino)-acetyl]-pyrrolidine-2(S)-carbonitrile) suspended in 1.6 g 2-butanone are added. The resulting suspension is stirred for 30 min., cooled to IT 50 °C within 2 h then to 30 °C within 1 h finally to 0 "C within 1 h and stirred for 1 additional h. After this the suspension is filtered and the crude product is washed twice with a cold (O^C) mixture of 60.4 g 2-butanone and 55.5 g t-butyl methyl ether. The product is dried under reduced pressure at about JT 55 °C. The melting point is 148°C.<br><br>
WE CLAIM:<br>
I. A process for the preparation of a N-(N'-substituted glycyl)-2-cyanopyrrolidine of<br><br>
and R"" independently are C1-7alkyl or phenyl which is unsubstituted or substituted by a substituent selected from C1-7alkyl, C1-7alkoxy, halogen and trifluormethyl and where R'" additionally is hydrogen; or R'" and R"" together are C1-7alkylene; and R" is hydrogen; or R' and R" independently are Ci.yalkyl; in free form or in acid addition salt form comprising:<br>
(a)	reacting, in the presence of dimethylformamide, a compound of formula (V)<br><br>
wherein, independently of each other, X1 and X3 are halogen; X2 is halogen, OH, O-C(=0)-CH2X3, -0-S02-(C,.8)alkyl or -0-S02-(aryl), with L-prolinamide, followed by<br>
(b)	reacting the resultant compound without isolation with a dehydration agent,<br>
followed by<br><br>
(c)	reacting, in the presence of a base, the resultant compound without isolation with<br>
an appropriate amine of formula (VI)<br>
HaNR	{V!}<br>
wherein the R is a substituted adamantly defined above; and n is 0, 1, 2 or 3; in free form or in acid addition salt form; and<br>
(d)	recovering the resultant compound in free form or in acid addition salt form.<br>
2.	The process as claimed in claim 1 wherein the dehydration agent of step (b) is a<br>
(haloalkylene)dialkylammomum halogenid.<br>
3.	The process as claimed in claim 1 or 2 wherein the dehydration agent of step (b) is<br>
(chloromethylene)dimethylammonium chloride.<br>
4.	The process as claimed in claim  1  wherein the N-(N'-substituted glycyi)-2(S)-<br><br></td>
