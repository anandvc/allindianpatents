				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a polymerisation process in particular to a gas phase process for the polymerisation of olefins using a catalyst system comprising an activated metallocene complex.<br>
Catalysts based on metallocene complexes have been widely used for the polymerisation of olefins.  These complexes are used in catalyst systems typically comprising a bis(cyclopentadienyl) transition metal as the complex and a cocatalyst.  Such bis (Cp) transition metal complexes are referred to as metallocenes and are typically based on titanium or zirconium metals and when used are cocatalysed with aluminium compounds such as aluminoxanes.  When used in gas phase processes such bis (Cp) metallocene systems may be supported on silica.   Such catalyst systems are described in EP 129368 and EP 206794.<br>
More recently another type of transition metal complex has been used to prepare olefin polymers.  Such complexes have a single cyclopentadienyl ring ligand and a hetero atom bonded to the metal atom and may also be used in conjunction with aluminoxanes.  These complexes are referred to as having a 'constrained geometry' and are described in EP 420436 and EP 416815.<br>
Similar catalyst systems are taught in EP 418044 and WO 92/00333.  In these systems the catalyst system comprises a mono(cyclopentadienyl) heteroatom metal complex and an ionic activator compound and such systems have been referred to as ionic mono(cyclopentadienyl) catalysts. Typical ionic activators for such systems may be exemplified by borates.<br>
WO 95/00520 describes titanium or zirconium complexes in which the transition metal is in the +2 formal oxidation state.  The complex also comprises a neutral, conjugated or non-conjugated diene ligand which forms a rc-complex with the metal.   Such complexes are rendered catalysts by combination with an<br>
activating cocatalyst for example aluminoxanes, boranes or borates. When used in a gas phase polymerisation process such catalysts are also suitably supported on silica.<br>
Another type of catalyst system is described in WO 96/04290. Here the metallocene complex is represented by a bis(Cp) complex but which also comprises conjugated dienes which may be associated with the metal as a -complex or G-complex.<br>
Metallocene complexes have been disclosed as suitable for use in processes for the polymerisation of olefins in the gas phase.  For example EP 206794, EP 696293, EP 719289, EP 802202, EP 659773, EP 593083 and EP 739360 disclose the use of metallocene complexes in the gas phase.<br>
We have now surprisingly found that in gas phase processes using activated metallocene catalyst systems an improvement in catalytic activity may be obtained by the injection of an inert liquid into the reactor<br>
In particular we found that the use of lower alkanes are particularly suitable for this purpose.<br>
Thus according to the present invention there is provided a process for the polymerisation of olefins in the gas phase said process being carried out in the presence of a catalyst system comprising (a) a metallocene and (b) an activator characterised in that a lower alkane is added to the gas phase reactor.<br>
The alkane is added preferably directly to the reactor.<br>

The alkane may be chosen from the group of lower alkanes consisting of butane, pentane, isopentane or hexane   Preferably the alkane is pentane.<br>
The alkane may be added to the gas phase reactor before addition of the monomer or monomers.   Preferably il is added as a liquid at room temperature and is added directly to the reactor   Alternatively the alkane may be continuously added in the reactor during the polymerisation process.<br>
The complexes according to the process of the present invention for use in the gas phase may be supported.   Alternatively the metallocene complex may be used in an unsupported form.<br>
When supported the support may be any organic or inorganic inert solid, particularly porous supports such as talc, inorganic oxides and resinous support materials such as polyolefms.   Suitable inorganic oxide materials which may be used include Group 2, 13. 14 or 15 metal oxides such as silica, alumina, silica-<br><br>
alumina and mixtures thereof.  Other inorganic oxides that may be employed either alone or in combination with the silica, alumina or silica-alumina are magnesia, titania or zirconia.  Other suitable support materials may be employed such as finely divided polyolefins such as polyethylene.<br>
The most preferred support material for use with the supported catalysts according to the process of the present invention is silica.<br>
It is preferable that the silica is dried before use and this is typically carried out by heating at elevated temperatures for example between 200 and 850 deg.C.<br>
In a preferred protocol the supported catalyst may be prepared by addition of a solution of the activator in a suitable solvent to a slurry of activated silica treated with a trialkylaluminium compound followed by addition of a solution of the metallocene complex in the same solvent.  Alternatively the complex may be added to the trialkylaluminium treated silica before addition of the activator.<br>
A suitable solvent for the preparation of the supported catalyst is toluene.<br>
Suitable trialkylaluminium compounds are trimethylaluminium (TMA), triethlyaluminium(TEA) or triisobutylaluminium (TIBAL).<br>
The process according to the present invention is suitable for use in the polymerisation of olefins in particularly in the homopolymerisation of ethylene or the copolymerisalion of ethylene with other alpha-olefins in particular those having from 3 to 10 carbon atoms.  Most preferred alpha-olefins are 1-butene, 1-hexene and 4-methyl-1 -pentene.<br>
The process of the invention may be carried out in any suitable gas phase process.<br>
For example traditional stirred bed reactors may be suitable such as those disclosed in US 3256263 and US 4012573.  However the process according to the present invention is particularly suitable for use in gas phase processes comprising a fluidised bed.   In such processes a fluidised bed of growing polymer particles is supported above a tluidisalioii grid   The bed is maintained in a fluidised state by use of a fluidising medium which comprises a recycled gas stream which passes upwards through the grid.<br>
A particular type of fluidised bed operation utilises the cooling of the recycled gas stream to aid the cooling of the fluidised bed   The cooled recycled stream containing entrained liquid is returned to the fluidised bed beneath the tluidisalioii grid.   For example EP K969 I   EP 6992 1 2 and EP 784637 disclose such gas phase processes<br><br>
Another type of gas phase process is that described in WO 94/28032 in which a recycled gas stream is cooled and separated into a gas stream and a liquid stream. The cooled liquid may be an inert liquid or may be a condensable monomer. The separated liquid stream is introduced directly into the fluidised bed in order to provide a cooling of the bed.<br>
In such fluidised bed processes the alkane may be added to the reactor by any suitable means. For example the alkane may be added directly to the reactor or may be added indirectly for example by addition to the recycle line, catalyst injection system, etc.<br>
The alkane may suitably be added continously to the fluidised bed reactor during the polymerisation process.<br>
With respect to gas phase processes, in particular fluidised bed reactors, the amount of alkene suitable for use in the process according to the present invention may preferably be represented with respect to the weight ratio of alkane to catalyst under steady state conditions. The weight ratio of alkane to catalyst is greater than or equal to 10. The weight ratio is preferably in the range 10-10,000.<br>
Alternatively the amount of alkane may be represented with respect to the weight ratio of alkane to the amount of polymer in the reactor under steady state conditions.  The minimum weight ratio of alkane to polymer is 0.010 and the preferred range for the weight ratio of alkane to polymer is 0.010 to 0.5 most preferably in the range 0.018 to 0.5.<br>
The alkane is particularly effective under polymerisation conditions of low comonomer concentrations.<br>
Using the process according to the present invention polymers may be prepared having densities in the range from 0.905 to 0.960 g/cc and a melt index in the range 0.1 to 20 according to ASTM D1238 condition E (2.16 kg. at 190 deg.C).<br>
The present invention will be further illustrated with reference to the following Examples. Example 1 Preparation of supported catalyst 1<br>
