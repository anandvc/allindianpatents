BRIDGED METALLOCENE COMPOUNDS AS OLEFIN-POLYMERIZATION CATALYSTS<br>
The present invention relates to bridged metallo" cone compounds, the corresponding ligands, a process for their preparation and the use of said compounds as components of catalysts for the polymerization of olefins.<br>
More specifically, the invention relates to met-allocene compounds consisting of indenyl-cyclopentadienyl groups, non-symmetrically joined by a bivalent radical.<br>
It is known that metallocene compounds can be used in various reactions of industrial interest.<br>
For example, chiral, stereo rigid metallocene compounds consisting of two bridged indenyl groups and a metal such as zirconium, are known and used as components of catalysts for the polymerization of olefins and, in particular’ for the preparation of stereo-regular polyolefins.<br>
In these metallocenes, the indenyl groups are joined by means of bivalent radicals which have two or more carbon atoms, such as -(CK2) 2 groups or with atoms different from carbon.<br><br>
These radicals are generally bound in different positions relating to the ring with five carbon atoms of both indenyl groups, as described in patent applications EP-A-485, 823, EP-A-372,414, WO 94/11406.<br>
Metallocenes are also known, whose indenyl groups are joined by means of bivalent radicals bound in position 4 of the ring with six carbon atoms of both in-deny groups, as described in patent applications EP 693 502, WO 96/38458.<br>
New metallocene compounds have now been found in which the bivalent radical is bound to the ring with five carbon atoms of a cyclopentadienyl, indenyl, fluorenyl group and to the ring with six carbon atoms of an indenyl group, which can be conveniently used as components of catalysts for the polymerization of olefins.<br>
An object of present invention relates, in particular, to metallocene compounds having general formula (I) :<br><br><br>

Ri, R2, R3/ R4/ Rs/ R6/ RT and Ra independently represent hydrogen, halogen, preferably F, CI or Br, a linear or branched, saturated or unsaturated, cycloaliphatic or aromatic C1-C20 hydrocarbyl group, or a C1-C20 hydrocarbyl group substituted with one or more halogen atoms, or a Ci’C2o hydrocarbyl group comprising one or more heteroatoms of groups 14 to 16 of the periodic table of elements, preferably Si, 0, N, S, P; in addition, any two, or both pairs, of the substituents R3, R’/ R5 and R6, adjacent to each other, are joined to each other to form a saturated or unsaturated C4-C20 cyclic structure, comprising a bond of the cyclopean’ maidenly ring, said structure optionally containing one or more of the heteroatoms specified above;<br>
M represents a metal selected from titanium, zirconium or hafnium;<br>
Xi and X2 each independently represent a group of an anionic nature bound to the metal M.<br><br>
Typical examples of Xi and X2 are hydride, halide,<br>

Xi and X2 can also be chemically bound to each other and form a cycle having from 4 to 7 different hydrogen atoms, also comprising the metal M.<br>
Typical examples of this aspect are divalent anionic groups such as the trimethylene or tetramethylene group, or the ethylenedioxy group.<br>
The metallocene compounds of the present invention can exist in isomeric, racemic or meso forms-<br>
A further object of the present invention relates to compounds having general formula (la) which are used for the preparation of the compounds having general formula (I):<br><br><br>

The compounds having general formula (la) can be prepared by means of a simple and original process which is illustrated in Scheme 1 below.<br><br>
a = LiBu (2eq.) /hexane; b = diethylcarbonate; c = PTSA/toluene; d = LiAlH4 or LiR or RMgX; e = PBr; f = Li(C5HR3R4R5R6)<br>
In particular said process comprises the following steps:<br>

Step (a) of the process of the present invention<br><br>
is described in Chem. Ber* (1980) 113, 1304,<br>
In particular, this article discloses that some benzyl alcohols and other phenyl carbinols, among which 1-indanol (Synthesis (1981) 59) can be deproto-nated in the presence of LiBu/tetramethylenediamine in pentane to give lithium(orthO"lithium)alkoxides.<br>
The reaction described in step (a) can be carried out in the presence of base reagents such as, for example, lithium butyl, lithium methyl, sodium hydride in hydrocarbon and/or ether solvents or their mixtures at temperatures ranging from -3C to 120’C; the preferred conditions comprise the use of lithium butyl in hexane at temperatures ranging from 0" to 70*’0,<br>
Typical 1-indanols having general formula (II) are 1-indanol, 2-methyl-1-indanol, 3-methyl-1-indanol, 3-ethyl-l-indanol, 4-methyl-l-indanol.<br>
One of the advantages of the process of the present invention consists in the fact that many 1-indanol derivatives are available on the market or can be easily prepared by means of well-known acyla-tion/alkylation reactions of aromatic rings suitably substituted.<br>
Step (b) of the process of the present invention comprises the reaction of the double lithium salt, having general formula (III), with electrophilie real-<br><br>
gents among which diethyl carbonate, dimethyl carbonate, carbon dioxide, ethyl chloroformiate, are particularly appropriate for the purpose, in hydrocarbon and/or ether solvents or their mixtures at temperatures ranging from -100” to 120°C, preferably with di--ethyl carbonate in hexane at temperatures ranging from -70° to 25°C. '<br>
Step (c) of the process of the present invention consists in the dehydration of the hydroxy ester (IV) to obtain the corresponding indenyl derivative having general formula (V) .<br>
This reaction can be carried out in the presence of strong acids such as HCl, H2SO4, paratoluenesulfonic acid or blander dehydrating agents such as, for example, silica gel*<br>
The choice of solvent for this reaction is very wide as it is possible to successfully use a polar solvents such as aliphatic hydrocarbons, medium polar solvents such as aromatic hydrocarbons or polar solvents such as ethers or chlorinated hydrocarbons; the temperature at which the reaction can take place can also be selected within a very wide range, typically from 25' to ISO'‘C and the selection generally depends not only on the substrate, but also on the type of solvent used, preferably paratoluenesulfonic acid in<br><br>
toluene is used at temperatures ranging from 50” to llO’C.<br>
Step (d) of the process of the present invention comprises the reduction of the ester group to alcohol with the formation of the compound having general formula {VI); this reduction can be carried out with various reagen'ts among which LiAlH’ NaBH’, NaH, MgHz, LiBu, LxMe, MeMgCl, PhMgBr, Bu’'MgCl, generally in ether solvents, but it is also possible to use alternative solvents having other characteristics, at temperatures ranging from -70° to lOO’C; LiAl’ in ethyl ether is preferably used at temperatures ranging from –30  to 25°C.<br>
Step (e) of the process of the present invention comprises the brominating of the alcohol function to give the bromine derivative having general formula (VII); also in this case there are various synthetic alternatives, well known to experts in the field, which comprise the use of various brominating agents in different solvents; the preferred conditions comprise the use of PBr3 in methylene chloride at temperatures ranging from -20° to 25°C,<br>
Step (f) of the process of the present invention, comprises the reaction of a cyclopentadienyl anion with the bromine derivative having general  formula<br><br>
(VII), obtained by the reaction of the corresponding neutral derivative, having general formula {VIII), with a suitable base.<br>
Experts in the field know that there is a wide variety of products capable of satisfying this requirement; it is in fact possible to use alkyls or hydrides of electro-positive metals such as, for example, lithium methyl, lithium butyl, lithium tert-butyl, magnesium dibutyl, sodium hydride, potassium hydride, magnesium hydride, the well-known Grignard reagents: RMgX, or also the alkaline or earth-alkaline metals themselves or their alloys.<br>
All the reagents are generally easy to find on the market/ with acceptable costs, and consequently their selection frequently depends on the type of substrate whose anion is to be obtained-<br>
The solvents for effecting this reaction can be selected from aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbons, ethers and/or their mixtures, the preference of one or the other often depending on the particular demands of solubility or reaction rate of the case in question.<br>
The temperatures at which the reaction is carried out can vary within a very wide range, typically from -80' to lick and essentially depend on the thermal stability of the substrates and on the solvent used.<br><br>
The preferred conditions for obtaining the anions of the compound having general formula (VIII) comprise the use of lithium butyl in mixtures of hexane/THF at temperatures ranging from 0° to 60°C.<br>

This reaction can be carried out in a wide variety of solvents selected from aromatic and/or ali-<br><br>
phatic hydrocarbons and from ethers and/or their mix-’ tures, at a temperature ranging from -80*" to 120”C, There are no particular limitations in the order of addition of the various reagents, but it is preferable to. operate by adding the bromine derivative (VII), either pure or diluted in ether solvent, to the solution/suspension containing the cyclopentadienyl anion, obtained as described above, at temperatures ranging from -70° to 25°C.<br>
Alternatively, step (f) of the process of the present invention can be carried out by reacting the brominated product {VII) with a suitable lithium eno-late giving rise to the formation of indenyl-cyclopentadienyl products having general formula (XIII):<br><br>

Ri2MgX;l;CuS04/   toluene/llO'C.<br>
In accordance with this, a further object of the present invention relates to a variant of the process for the preparation of compounds having general formula (la) , which gives rise to the formation of analogous products having general formula (XIII) wherein ■ the substituents Ri, R2, Ri, Rg, R9, Rio/ Rii and R12 have the meaning defined above, which comprises the following steps:<br><br>
(g) reaction of a cyclic ketone, having general formula (IX), wherein the groups R9, Rio and Ru have the meaning defined above, with a lithium amide to give the mixture of anions having general formula (Xa)/(Xb);<br>

In step (g) a cyclic ketone having general formula (IX) is reacted with a strong non-alkylating base, in ether solvents such as ethyl ether, tetrahy-drofuran, dioxane, as the dissolving capacity of the latter can improve the reaction kinetics, but this does not mean that less polar solvents, such as aro-<br><br>
matic and/or aliphatic hydrocarbons, can also be conveniently used for the purpose, at temperatures ranging from -80'C to llO’'C, the selection of the latter depending on the type of solvent and substrates used.<br>
Typical strong bases, suitable for the purpose, are alcoholates of alkaline and earth-alkaline metals such as for example lithium methoxide, sodium methox-ide, sodium ethoxide, sodium iso-propoxide, potassium Cer-butoxide, magnesium di-ethoxide, etc, or the relative amides such as, for example, lithium amide, sodium amide, lithium di--ethylamide, lithium di-isopropylamide, lithium bis’(trimethylsilyl)amide, potassium di’butylamide, etc.<br>
In the preferred embodiment the strong bases are selected from lithium methoxide, sodium ethoxide, potassium ter-butoxide, sodium amide, lithium di-isopropylamide.<br>
In an even more preferred embodiment the strong base is lithium di-isopropylamide*<br>
Typical cyclic ketones having general formula (IX), suitable for being used in step (g) of Scheme 2 are: cyclopent-l-en-3-one, l-methyl-cyclopent-l-en-3-one, 1,2,5-tri-methyl-cyclopent-l-en-3-one, indan-1-one, 3-methyl-indan-l-one, 4,7-dimethyl-indan-l--one, indan-2-one, etc.<br><br>

Step (h) 'of the process of the present invention consists in the reaction between the mixture of anions (Xa)/(Xb) with the brominated product (VII), prepared according to Scheme 1, which can be carried out in hydrocarbon/ ether solvents or their mixtures, the use of the same solvent adopted in the previous step (g)/ at temperatures ranging from -80”C to 70*’0, normally being preferred.<br>
In a preferred embodiment/ the reaction is carried out in a mixture of THF/hexane at temperatures ranging from -70” to 25*'C,<br>
Step (i) of the process of the present invention consists in a reduction of the functional carbonyl group, present in the derivative having general formula (XI) , to alcohol, with the formation of the compound having general formula (XII), There are various possibilities, well known to experts in the field/ for selecting the reducing reagents suitable for the purpose, among which lithium aluminum hydride, sodium bo-<br><br>
ron hydride, sodium hydride, lithium methyl, lithium phenyl, ethyl magnesium bromide, isopropyl magnesium bromide, etc., which can be successfully used either in hydrocarbon or ether solvents or their mixtures, at temperatures ranging from -40° to 70°C. In a preferred embodiment, sodium boron hydride in tetrahydrofuran is used at temperatures ranging from -20*" to 25°C-<br>
Step (1) of the process of the present invention, consists in the dehydration of the derivative (XII), obtained in step (i), to give the desired indenyl-cyclopentadienyl product having general formula (XIII).<br>
The latter can be carried out in the presence of dehydrating agents such as, for example, silica gel, strong acids such as HCl, H2SO4, paratoluenesulfonic acid, or anhydrous inorganic salts such as, for example, Cu(SOJ, Mg(S04), Na(S04)2/ CaCls, etc.<br>
The selection of the solvent for this reaction is very wide as it is possible to successfully use apolar solvents such as aliphatic hydrocarbons, medium polar solvents such as aromatic hydrocarbons or polar solvents such as ethers or chlorinated hydrocarbons; the temperature at which the reaction takes place can also be selected within a very wide range, typically from -20" to 130*’0 and- the selection generally depends not<br><br>
only on the substrate but also on the type of solvent used. In a preferred embodiment anhydrous Cu(S04) is used in toluene at 110°C-<br>
The processes of the present invention do not necessarily require the isolation of the single reaction products at the end of the respective steps*<br>
In addition to the advantage of starting from products which are easily available, the processes comprise quite simple chemical passages and produce satisfactory overall yields.<br>
The preparation of the complexes having general formula (I) can be carried out according to one of the well-known methods described in literature for the production of bridged bis-cyclopentadienyl complexes of transition metals.<br>
The method most commonly used comprises reacting a salt of the metal M (preferably a chloride) , with a salt of an alkaline metal of the dianion of the bis-cyclo-pentadienyl ligand having the desired structure.<br>
The preparation of the complexes having formula (I) normally comprises two steps, in the first of which the ligand having general formula (la) is re* acted with a lithium alkyl, such as lithium methyl or lithium butyl, in an inert solvent, preferably consisting of an aromatic hydrocarbon or an ether, par-<br><br>
ticularly tetrahydrofuran or ethyl ether-<br>
The temperature during the reaction is preferably maintained below room temperature to avoid the creation of secondary reactions. At the end of the reaction the corresponding lithium salt of the cyclopenta-dienyl dianion is obtained-<br>
In the second step, the salt of the cyclopentadi-enyl dianion is reacted with a salt, preferably a chloride, of the transition metal M, again in an inert organic solvent at a temperature preferably ranging from -30"* to 70°C.<br>
At the end of the reaction, the complex having formula (I) thus obtained is separated and purified according to the known methods of organometallic chemistry.<br>
As is known to experts in the field, the above operations are sensitive to the presence of air and humidity and should therefore be carried out in an inert atmosphere, preferably under nitrogen or argon.<br>
Numerous general and specific methods which substantially originate from the method indicated above, are described in literature, such as, for example in the publications of D.J. Cardin "Chemistry of Organo Zr and Hf Compounds" J- Wiley and Sons Ed., New York (1936);  R.  Haltermann  "Chemical  Review",  vol.  92<br><br>
(1992) pages 965-994; R.O, Duthaler and A. Hafner "Chemical Review'‘, vol. 92 (1992) pages 807--832.<br>
The metallocene compounds of the present invention can be conveniently used as catalytic components for the polymeri’ation of olefins.<br>
A further object of the present- invention therefore relates to a catalyst for the polymerization of olefins comprising the reaction product between:<br>
(A)	a metallocene compound having formula (I) obtained as described above, and<br>
(B)	one or more compounds capable of activating the metallocene (I) selected from those known in the art, particularly an organic derivative of an element M' different from carbon and selected from the elements of groups 1, 2, 12, 13 and 14 of the periodic table.<br>
In particular, according to the present invention, said element M' is selected from boron, aluminum, 2inc, magnesium, gallium and tin, more particularly boron and aluminum.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the component (B) is an organo-oxygenated derivative of aluminum, gallium or tin. This can be defined as an organic compound of M', in which the latter is bound to at least one oxygen atom and to at least one organic group consisting of an alkyl group<br><br>
having from 1 to 12 carbon atoms, preferably methyl.<br>
According to this aspect of the invention, component (B) is more preferably an aluminoxane* ■ As is known, aluminoxanes are compounds containing Al-O-Al bonds, with a varying 0/Al ratio, which can be ob’ tained, under controlled conditions, by the reaction of an aluminum alkyl or aluminum alkyl halide, with water or other compounds containing pre-established quantities of water available, such as, for example, in the case of the reaction of aluminum trimethy1 with aluminum sulfate hexahydrate, copper sulfate pentahy-drate or iron sulfate pentahydrate,<br>
Aluminoxanes preferably used for the formation of the polymerization catalyst of the present invention are oligo- poly-meric, cyclic and/or linear compounds, characterized by the presence of repetitive units having the following formula:<br><br>
wherein R’s is a C1-C12 alkyl group, preferably methyl.<br>
Each dialuminoxane molecule preferably contains from 4 to 7 0 repetitive units which may also not ail be equal to each other, but contain different Ri3 groups.<br>

Also included in the scope of the present invention are those catalysts comprising two or more complexes having formula (I) mixed with each other. Catalysts of the present invention based on mixtures of complexes having different catalytic activities can be advantageously used in polymerization when a wider molecular weight distribution of the polyolefins thus produced is desired.<br>
According to an aspect of the present invention, in order to produce solid components for the formation of catalysts for the polymerization of olefins,  the<br><br>
above complexes can also be supported on inert solids, preferably consisting of oxides of Si and/or Al, such as for example, silica, alumina or silica-aluminates.<br>
For the supporting of said catalysts, the known supporting techniques can be used, normally comprising contact, in a suitable inert liquid medium, between the carrier, optionally activated by heating to temperatures exceeding 200”C, and one or both of compo-nents (A) and (B) of the catalyst of the present invention. For the purposes of the present invention, it is not necessary for both components to be supported, as it is also possible for only the complex having formula (I) or the organic compound of B, Al, Ga or Sn as defined above, to be present on the surface of the carrier. In the latter case, the component which is not present on the surface is subsequently put in con’ tact with the supported component, at the moment of the formation of the catalyst active for the polymerization.<br>
Also included in the scope of the present invention are the complexes, and catalytic systems based on these, which have been supported on a solid by means of the functionalization of the latter and formation of a covalent bond between the solid and a metallocene complex included in formula (I) above.<br><br>
A particular method for the formation of a supported catalyst according to the present invention comprises pre-polymerizing a relatively small fraction of monomer or mixture of monomers in the presence of the catalyst, so as to include this in a solid micro-particulate,- which is then fed to the actual reactor itself for completing the process in the presence of an additional olefin(s)- This provides a better control of the morphology and dimensions of the polymeric particulate obtained at the end.<br>
One or more other additives or components can be optionally added to the catalyst according to the present invention, as well as the two components (A) and (B), to obtain a catalytic system suitable fcr satisfying specific requisites. The catalytic systems thus obtained should be considered as being included in the scope of the present invention* Additives or components which can be included in the preparation and/or formulation of the catalyst of the present invention are inert solvents such as, for example, aliphatic and/or aromatic hydrocarbons, aliphatic and aromatic ethers, weakly co-ordinating additives (Lewis bases) selected, for example, from non-polymerizable olefins, ethers, tertiary amines and alcohols, halogenating agents such as silicon ha1ides, halogenated hydrocar-<br><br>
bons, preferably chlorinated, . and the like, and again all other possible components normally used in the art for the preparation of the traditional homogeneous catalysts of the metal locene type for the (CO)polymerization of olefins.<br>
Components (A) and (B) form the catalyst of the present invention by contact with each other, preferably at temperatures ranging from 20” to 60’'C and for times varying from 10 seconds to 1 hour, more preferably from 30 seconds to 15 minutes.<br>
The catalysts according to the present invention can be used with excellent results in substantially all known (co)polymerization processes of olefins, either in continuous or batchwise, in one or more steps, such as, for example, processes at low (0,1-1-0 MPa), medium (1,0’10 MPa) or high (10-150 MPa) pressure, at temperatures ranging from 10" to 240’C, optionally in the presence of an inert diluent. Hydrogen can be conveniently used as molecular weight regulator.<br>
These processes can be carried out in solution or suspension in a liquid diluent normally consisting of an aliphatic or cycloaliphatic saturated hydrocarbon, having from 3 to 20 carbon atoms or a mixture of two or more of these, but which can also consist of a monomer  as,   for  example,   in  the  known  co-<br><br>
polymerization process of ethylene and propylene in liquid propylene• The quantity of catalyst introduced into the polymerization mixture is preferably selected so that the concentration of the metal M ranges from 10"' to 10"‘ moles/liter.<br>
Alternatively, the polymerization can be carried out in gas phase, for example, in a fluid bed reactor, normally at pressures ranging from 0.5 to 5 MPa and at temperatures ranging from 50 to 150°C,<br>
According to a particular aspect of the present invention, the catalyst for the (co)polymerization of ethylene with other olefins is prepared separately (preformed) by contact of components (A) and (B), and is subsequently introduced into the polymerization en’ vifonment-<br>
The catalyst can be first charged into the polymerization reactor, followed by the reagent mixture containing the olefin or mixture of olefins to be polymerized, or the catalyst can be charged into the re’ actor already containing the reagent mixture, or finally, the reagent mixture and the catalyst can be contemporaneously fed into the reactor.<br>
According to another aspect of the present invention, the catalyst is formed "in .situ", for example by introducing components (A) and (B) separately into the<br><br>
polymerization reactor containing the pre-selected olefinic monomers.<br>
The catalysts according to the present invention can be used with excellent results in the polymerization of ethylene to give linear polyethylene and in the copolymerization of ethylene with propylene or higher olefins, preferably having from 4 to 12 carbon atoms, to give copolymers having different chara(iter-istics depending on the specific polymerization conditions and on the quantity and structure of the comono-mer used.<br>
For example,  linear polyethylenes can be ob*<br>
* ■<br>
tained, with a density ranging from 0.880 to 0.940, and with molecular weights ranging from 10,000 to 2,000,000. The olefins preferably used as comonoraers of ethylene in the production of low or medium density linear polyethylene (known with the abbreviations ULDPE, VLDPE and LLDPE depending on the density), are 1-butene, 1-hexene and 1-octene.<br>
The catalyst of the present invention can also be conveniently used in copolymerization processes of ethylene and propylene to give saturated elastomeric copolymers vulcanizable by means of peroxides and extremely resistant to aging and degradation, or in the terpolymerization of ethylene, propylene and a diene,<br><br>
generally" non-conjugated, having from 4 to 20 carbon atoms, to obtain vulcanizable rubbers of the EPDM type.<br>
In the case of these latter processes, it has been found that the catalysts of the present invention allow the production of polymers having a particularly high comonomer content and average molecular weight under the polymerization conditions.<br>
In the case of the preparation of EPDM, the di- . enes which can be used for the purpose are preferably selected from:<br>
•	linear chain dienes such as  1,4-hexadiene and 1,6-octadiene;<br>
•	branched dienes such as 5*methyl-l, 4-hexadiene; 3, 7-dimethyl-l, 6-octadiene;     3,7--dimethyl-l, 7-<br>
octadiene;<br>
•	dienes  with  a  single  ring  such  as  1/4-<br>
cyclohexadiene;     1,5-cyclo-octadiene;     1,5-<br>
cyclododecadiene;<br>
•	dienes having bridged condensed rings such as di-<br>
cyclopentadiene;    bicycle[2.2*l]hepta-2,5-diene;<br>
alchenyl, alkylidene, cycloalkenyl and cycloalky-<br>
lidene   norbornenes   such   as   5’methylene-2-<br>
norbornene,  5-ethylidene-2-borbornene  (ENB),  5-<br>
propenyl-2’norbornene•<br><br>
Among the non-conjugated dienes typically used for preparing these copolymers, dienes containing at least one double bond in a stretched ring are preferred, even more preferably 5’ethylidene’2-norbornene (ENB), and also 1,4-hexadiene and 1,6-octadiene.<br>
In the case of EPDM terpolymers, it is convenient for the quantity of dienic monomer not to exceed 15% by weight, and it is preferably from 2 to 10% by weight. The propylene content on the other hand ranges from 20 to 55% by weight.<br>
The catalysts of the present invention can also be used in homo- and co-polymerization processes of olefins according to the known techniques, giving, with excellent yields, atactic, isotactic or syndio-tactic polymers, depending on the structure and geome--try of the metallocene complex having formula (I).<br>
Olefins suitable for the purpose are those having from 3 to 20 carbon atoms, optionally also comprising halogens and/or other heteroatoms or aromatic nuclei such as, for example, propylene, 1-butene, 1-hexene, 1-octene, 4-methyl-l-pentene, 1-decene and styrene.<br>
