				<td>POLYMERIZABLE POLYOL(ALLYL CARBONATE) COMPOSITIONS<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
This application is a Continuation-In-Part (CIP) of<br>
United States Patent Application having Serial Number<br>
09/459,796 which was filed on December 13, 1999 and is pending<br>
in the United States Patent and Trademark Office.<br>
The present invention relates to a polymerizable<br>
composition. More particularly, the present invention relates<br>
to a polymerizable composition comprising polyol(allyl<br>
carbonate) monomer and a urethane having at least two allyl or<br>
substituted allyl groups. The present invention relates also<br>
to polymerizates, e.g., lenses, obtained from the<br>
polymerizable compositions.<br>
Polymerizable organic compositions based on polyol(allyl<br>
carbonate), particularly diethylene glycol bis(allyl<br>
carbonate), and polymerizates obtained therefrom are well<br>
known in the art. Polymerizates of polymerizable organic<br>
compositions based on homopolymers of diethylene glycol<br>
bis(allyl carbonate) possess excellent clarity, good<br>
flexibility and abrasion resistance. Examples of applications<br>
for which such polymerizates may be used include, ophthalmic<br>
lenses, sunglasses, and automotive and aircraft<br>
transparencies. It has been observed that tinting of<br>
polymerizates prepared from such compositions by surface<br>
impregnation of dyes can, in certain instances, result in an<br>
uneven tinting of the surface. Such uneven tinting is<br>
referred to as tinting failure.<br>
When tinting failure occurs, it is often manifested as<br>
visually observable defects on the tinted surface(s) of the<br>
polymerizate, which are commonly referred to as "ferns" or<br>
"moons." In the case of tinted ophthalmic lenses, such as<br>
tinted ophthalmic lenses having a positive diopter, i.e., plus<br>
lenses, and non-corrective lenses, e.g., sunglasses, such<br>
tinting failure often results in rejection and scrapping of<br>
the tinted lens. A solution to tinting failure is desirable<br>
in order to avoid the economic loss that results from the<br>
scrapping of lenses having tinting defects.<br>
United States Patent No.'s 4,994,208, 5,084,529,<br>
5,110,881, 5,221,721, 5,236,978 and 5,246,630 describe<br>
polymerizable compositions composed of polyol(allyl carbonate)<br>
monomer and at least 10 weight percent of aliphatic<br>
polyurethanes, the terminal portions of which contain allyl<br>
functional groups. United States Patent No. 5,200,483<br>
describes organic resin compositions containing polyol(allyl<br>
carbonate) monomer and a mixture of aliphatic urethanes, the<br>
terminal portions of which contain allyl or acrylyl functional<br>
groups.<br>
It has now been discovered that cured polymerizates<br>
prepared from the polymerizable compositions of the present<br>
invention are substantially free of tinting defects, for<br>
example, tinting defects referred to in the art as ferns or<br>
moons. In accordance with the present invention there is<br>
provided a polymerizable composition comprising:<br>
(a) a major amount of a radically polymerizable<br>
first monomer represented by the following general formula I,<br>
R-[-O-C(O)-O-R1]<br>
wherein R is a polyvalent residue of a polyol having at least<br>
two hydroxy groups, R1 is an allyl or substituted allyl group,<br>
and i is a whole number from 2 to 4; and<br>
(b) a minor amount of a radically polymerizable<br>
second monomer represented by the following general formula<br>
wherein R2 is a polyvalent linking group that is free of<br>
urethane linkages; R3 is a residue of a material having a<br>
single hydroxy group and at least one allyl group, R-, being<br>
free of urethane linkages, acryloyl groups and methacryloyl<br>
groups; and j is a number from 2 to 4, e.g., 2, 3 or 4.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, said second<br>
monomer (b) is present in said composition in an amount at<br>
least sufficient such that a polymerizate of said composition<br>
is substantially free of tinting defects.<br>
The features that characterize the present invention are<br>
pointed out with particularity in the claims, which are<br>
annexed to and form a part of this disclosure. These and<br>
other features of the invention, its operating advantages and<br>
the specific objects obtained by its use will be more fully<br>
understood from the following detailed description and the<br>
accompanying illustrative drawing.<br>
Other than in the operating examples, or where otherwise<br>
indicated, all numbers expressing quantities of ingredients,<br>
reaction conditions, etc. used in the specification and claims<br>
are to be understood as modified in all instances by the term<br>
"about."<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING<br>
Figure 1 is a representation of a negative image of a<br>
tinted lens having tinting defects.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the second<br>
monomer described with reference to general formula II is<br>
present in the polymerizable compositions in an amount at<br>
least sufficient such that polymerizates prepared from such<br>
compositions are substantially free of tinting defects. As<br>
used herein and in the claims, the term "tinting defects" and<br>
similar terms refer generally to a visually observable uneven<br>
distribution of dye over the surface of a tinted polymerizate,<br>
such as a tinted lens. More particularly, tinting defects are<br>
often visually observable as lighter colored or untinted<br>
surface patterns, sometimes in the form of ferns or moons.<br>
Tinting defects in the form of ferns can be further<br>
described with reference to Figure 1. The tinted polymerizate<br>
4 of Figure 1 is a tinted plus lens 11, prepared from<br>
diethylene glycol bis(allyl carbonate) monomer, and having<br>
tinting defects 15 thereon. For purposes of illustration, the<br>
tinting defects 15 of Figure 1 are shown as a negative image.<br>
As used herein, by "plus lens" is meant a lens having a<br>
positive (+) diopter, i.e., a lens having a positive focal<br>
length or real focal point. The tinting defects shown in the<br>
lens depicted in Figure 1 were observed in a lens having a<br>
plus five (+5) diopter.<br>
Tinting defects in the form of moons (not shown in Figure<br>
1) are typically observed as a series of concentric circles of<br>
varying tint strength on the surface of the tinted lens. In<br>
some instances a tinted lens will exhibit a combination of<br>
both moon and fern type tinting defects.<br>
The occurrence of tinting defects with polymerizates<br>
prepared from polyol(allyl carbonate) monomers is a largely<br>
statistical phenomenon. Accordingly, in order to determine if<br>
a polymerizable composition can be used to prepare<br>
polymerizates that are "substantially free of tinting<br>
defects," more than one polymerizate, e.g., several lenses,<br>
should be prepared. Optionally, a set of comparative<br>
polymerizates may also be prepared under similar conditions,<br>
e.g., using the same cure cycle, from a composition that is<br>
known to result in tinting defects. The specific number of<br>
polymerizates that must be prepared is often determined by<br>
trial and error. In the case of ophthalmic lenses, typically<br>
between 10 and 100 lenses are prepared to determine if they<br>
are substantially free of tinting defects. Such a<br>
determination is described in further detail in the Examples<br>
herein. Typically, a set of polymerizates, e.g., 100<br>
ophthalmic plus lenses, prepared from a pclymerizable<br>
composition according to the present inention, is considered<br>
to be substantially free of tinting defects if 10 percent or<br>
less, preferably 5 percent or less, and more preferably 0<br>
percent of the tinted polymerizates have tinting defects, such<br>
as ferns.<br>
Second monomer (b) is present in the polymerizable<br>
composition of the present invention in a minor amount (e.g.,<br>
from 0.1 percent by weight to 49 percent by weight, based on<br>
the total weight of the composition). Typically, second<br>
monomer (b) is present in the composition of the instant<br>
invention in an amount of at least 0.1 percent by weight,<br>
preferably at least 0.2 percent by weight, and more preferably<br>
at least 0.3 percent by weight, based on the total weight of<br>
the composition. Second monomer (b) is also typically present<br>
in the composition of the present invention in an anount of<br>
less than 10 percent by weight, preferably less than 5 percent<br>
by weight and more preferably less than 3 percent by weight,<br>
based on the total weight of the composition. The amount of<br>
second monomer (b) present in the composition of the present<br>
invention may range between any combination of these values,<br>
inclusive of the recited values, e.g., from 0.1 percent by<br>
weight to 10 percent by weight or from 0.3 percent by weight<br>
to 3 percent by weight, based on the total weight of the<br>
composition.<br>
With reference to general formula II, second monomer (b)<br>
is distinguishable from polyurethanes having terminal allyl<br>
functional groups as described in, for example, United States<br>
Patent No.'s 4,994,208, 5,084,529, 5,110,881, 5,221,721,<br>
5,236,978 and 5,246,630. In general formula II, R2 and R3 are<br>
each free of urethane linkages, more particularly, R2 and R3<br>
are each free of internal urethane linkages. As used herein<br>
and in the claims, the term "urethane linkage" is meant to<br>
refer to the following structural linkage, -N(H)-C(O)-O-. In<br>
the case when R2 is a residue of a polyisocyanate, second<br>
monomer (b) can be described as a polyisocyanate that is<br>
capped with the mono-hydroxy functional material of which R3 is<br>
a residue.<br>
Depending on the method by which second monomer (b) is<br>
prepared, R2 may be a residue of, for example, a<br>
polyisocyanate, i.e., a material having at least two<br>
isocyanate groups, or a polyamine, i.e., a material having at<br>
least two primary amine groups. When the second monomer is<br>
prepared by capping a polyisocyanate with the mono-hydroxy<br>
functional material of which R3 is a residue, R2 is a residue<br>
of a polyisocyanate. The second monomer may also be prepared<br>
by first reacting the mono-hydroxy functional material of<br>
which R3 is a residue with phosgene to forn the corresponding<br>
chloroformate, which is then reacted with a polyamine, in<br>
which case R2 is a residue of a polyamine.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, R2 is a<br>
residue of a polyisocyanate having at least two isocyanate<br>
groups, and the polyisocyanate may be selected from aromatic<br>
polyisocyanates, aliphatic polyisocyanates, cycloaliphatic<br>
polyisocyanates and mixtures thereof. As used herein and in<br>
the claims, the term "polyisocyanate" is meant to be inclusive<br>
of dimers and trimers of polyisocyanates, for example, trimers<br>
of diisocyanates containing a core isocyanurate ring.<br>
Classes of aromatic polyisocyanates of which R2 may be a<br>
residue include, for example, aromatic polyisocyanates wherein<br>
the isocyanate groups are not bonded directly to the aromatic<br>
ring, e.g., a,a'-xylene diisocyanate; and aromatic<br>
polyisocyanates wherein the isocyanate groups are bonded<br>
directly to the aromatic ring, e.g., benzene diisocyanate.<br>
Examples of aromatic polyisocyanates having isocyanate<br>
groups bonded directly to the aromatic ring, of which R2 may be<br>
a residue include, but are not limited to, phenylene<br>
diisocyanate, ethylphenylene diisocyanate, isopropylphenylene<br>

bis(isocyanatophenylether)-1,3-propyleneglycol, benzophenone<br>
diisocyanate, carbazole diisocyanate, ethylcarbazole<br>
diisocyanate and dichlorocarbazole diisocyanate. Examples of<br>
aromatic polyisocyanates wherein the isocyanate groups are not<br>
bonded directly to the aromatic ring, of which R2 may be a<br>
residue include, but are not limited to,<br>
bis(isocyanatoethyl)benzene, a,a,a',a'-tetramethylxylene<br>
diisocyanate, 1,3-bis(1-isocyanato-l-methylethyl)benzene,<br>

2,5-di(isocyanatomethyl)furan.<br>
Aliphatic polyisocyanates of which B2 may be a residue<br>
may be selected from, for example, ethylene diisocyanate,<br>

In an embodiment of the present invention, R2 of general<br>
formula II is a residue of a cycloaliphatic polyisocyanate.<br>
Examples of cycloaliphatic polyisocyanates of which R2 may be a<br>
residue include, but are not limited to, isophorone<br>
diisocyanate, cyclohexane diisocyanate, methylcyclohexane<br>
diisocyanate, bis(isocyanatomethyl)cyclohexane,<br>
bis(isocyanatocyclohexyl)methane, bis(isocyanatocyclohexyl)-<br>
2,2-propane, bis(isocyanatocyclohexyl)-1,2-ethane, 2-<br>
isocyanatomethyl-3-(3-isocyanatopropyl)-5-isocyanatomethyl-<br>
bicyclo[2.2.1]-heptane, 2-isocyanatomethyl-3-(3-<br>
isocyanatopropyl)-6-isocyanatomethyl-bicyclo[2.2.1]-heptane,<br>
2-isocyanatomethyl-2-(3-isocyanatopropyl)-5-isocyanatomethyl-<br>
bicyclo[2.2.1]-heptane, 2-isocyanatomethyl-2-(3-<br>
isocyanatopropyl)-6-isocyanatomethyl-bicyclo[2.2.1]-heptane,<br>
2-isocyanatomethyl-3-(3-isocyanatopropyl)-6-(2-<br>
isocyanatoethyl)-bicyclo[2.2.1]-heptane, 2-isocyanatomethyl-2-<br>
(3-isocyanatopropyl)-5-(2-isocyanatoethyli-bicyclo[2.2.1]-<br>
heptane and 2-isocyanatomethyl-2-(3-isocyanatopropyl)-6-(2-<br>
isocyanatoethyl)-bicyclo[2.2.1]-heptane. In a preferred<br>
embodiment of the present invention, R;; is a residue of a<br>
cycloalphatic diisocyanate selected from, for example,<br>
isophorone diisocyanate, cyclohexane diisocyanate,<br>
methylcyclohexane diisocyanate,<br>
bis(isocyanatomethyl)cyclohexane,<br>
bis(isocyanatocyclohexyl)methane, bis(isocyanatocyclohexyl)-<br>
2,2-propane, bis(isocyanatocyclohexyl)-1,2-ethane, and<br>
mixtures thereof. When R2 is a residue of a diisocyanate, such<br>
as a cycloaliphatic diisocyanate, j of general formula II is<br>
2.<br>
Classes of polyamines of which R2 may be a residue,<br>
include, aromatic polyamines, aliphatic polyamines,<br>
cycloaliphatic polyamines, each having at least two primary<br>
amines, and mixtures thereof. As is known to the skilled<br>
artisan, polyisocyanates are typically prepared from the<br>
corresponding polyamine precursors having two or more primary<br>
amine groups. Accordingly, specific examples of polyamines<br>
within these recited classes include, but are not limited to,<br>
polyamine precursors corresponding to those polyisocyanates as<br>
recited previously herein.<br>
With further reference to general formula II, R3 is a<br>
residue of a material having a single hydroxy group and one or<br>
more allyl groups. The mono-hydroxy functional material of<br>
which R, is a residue is free of acryloyl groups and.<br>
methacryloyl groups. The allyl group may be an unsubstituted<br>
allyl group or a substituted allyl group, as represented by<br>
the following general formula III,<br>
III<br>
H2C=C(R4) -CH2-<br>
wherein R4 is hydrogen, halogen or a C1 to C4 alkyl group.<br>
More typically, R4 is hydrogen and consequently general formula<br>
III represents the unsubstituted allyl group, H2C=CH-CH2- .<br>
More specifically, the allyl group of the material having a<br>
single hydroxy group, of which R3 is a residue, may be an allyl<br>
ether, an allyl carbonate or an allyl ester group. The<br>
material of which R3 is a residue typically has at least one<br>
allyl ether group.<br>
The mono-hydroxy functional material of which R3 is a<br>
residue may be selected from aromatic alcohols, aliphatic<br>
alcohols, cycloaliphatic alcohols, poly(alkylene glycols),<br>
each having at least one allyl group, and combinations<br>
thereof. Examples of aromatic alcohols having at least one<br>
allyl group include, but are not limited to, allyloxy phenol,<br>
e.g., 4-allyloxy phenol, allyloxybenzyl alcohol, e.g., 4-<br>
allyloxybenzyl alcohol, and 4-allyl-2,6-dimethoxyphenol.<br>
Cycloaliphatic alcohols having at least one allyl group of<br>
which R-j may be a residue include, for example, allyloxymethyl<br>
cyclohexylmethanols, e.g., 4-allyloxymethyl<br>
cyclohexylmethanol.<br>
Examples of aliphatic alcohols having at least one allyl<br>
group, of which R3 may be a residue include, but are not<br>
limited to, allyl alcohol, substituted allyl alcohols, e.g.,<br>
methallyl alcohol, allyl ethers of alkylene glycols, e.g., C2-<br>
C4 alkylene glycols, such as, ethylene glycol allyl ether and<br>
1,2- or 1,3-propylene glycol allyl ether. A preferred class<br>
of aliphatic alcohols, of which R3 may be a residue, are<br>
poly(allyl ethers) of aliphatic polyols, e.g., trimethylol<br>
propane di(allyl ether), trimethylol ethane di(allyl ether),<br>
pentaerythritol tri (allyl ether), and di-trimethylolpropane<br>
tri(allyl ether).<br>
Poly(alkylene glycols) of which R3 may be a residue<br>
include, for example, homopolymeric, block copolymeric, e.g.,<br>
diblock and triblock copolymeric, and random copolymeric<br>
poly(alkylene glycols), such as poly(C2-C4 alkylene glycols),<br>
having a single allyl ether group and a single hydroxy group.<br>
Examples of poly(alkylene glycol) allyl ethers of which R3 may<br>
be a residue include, for example, poly(ethylene glycol) allyl<br>
ether, poly(1,2-propylene glycol) allyl ether, poly(l,2-<br>
butylene glycol) allyl ether, poly(ethylene glycol)-b-<br>
poly(1,2-propylene glycol) allyl ether, poly(1,2-propylene<br>
glycol)-b-poly(ethylene glycol) allyl ether, poly(1,2-butylene<br>
glycol)-b-poly(ethylene glycol) allyl ether, poly(ethylene<br>
glycol)-b-poly(1,2-butylene glycol) allyl ether and<br>
poly(ethylene glycol)-b-poly(1,2-propylene glycol)-b-poly(1,2-<br>
butylene) allyl ether.<br>
The poly(alkylene glycol) allyl ethers of which R3 may be<br>
a residue have at least 2 alkylene ether units. For example,<br>
diethylene glycol allyl ether has two (2) ethylene ether<br>
units, i.e., H2C=CHCH2O- (-CH2CH?-O-) 2-H . Typically, the<br>
poly(alkylene glycol) allyl ether has less than 100 alkylene<br>
ether units, e.g., less than 50, less than 20 or less than 15<br>
alkylene ether units. The poly(alkylene glycol) allyl ether<br>
may have a number of alkylene ether units ranging between any<br>
combination of these values, inclusive of the recited values,<br>
e.g., from 2 to 100, 2 to 50, 2 to 20 or 2 to 15 alkylene<br>
ether units.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the material<br>
of which R3 is a residue is selected from a C2-C4 alkylene<br>
glycol allyl ether, a poly(C2-C4 alkylene glycol) allyl ether,<br>
trimethylol propane di(allyl ether), trimethylol ethane<br>
di (allyl ether), pentaerythritol tri(allyl ether), di-<br>
trimethylolpropane tri(allyl ether) and mixtures thereof. In<br>
a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the material<br>
of which R3 is a residue is selected from poly(ethylene glycol)<br>
allyl ether, poly(1,2-propylene glycol) allyl ether and<br>
mixtures thereof.<br>
The polymerizable organic composition of the present<br>
invention includes also a radically polymerizable first<br>
monomer as described above with reference to general formula<br>
1, which may be further described as a polyol(allyl carbonate)<br>
monomer. Polyol(allyl carbonate) monomers that may be used in<br>
the aforedescribed polymerizable organic composition are allyl<br>
carbonates of, for example, linear or branched aliphatic<br>
polyols, e.g., aliphatic glycol bis(allyl carbonate)<br>
compounds, and cycloaliphatic polyols. The scope of the<br>
present invention also includes allyl carbonates of aromatic<br>
polyols, e.g., 4,4'-isopropylidenediphenol bis(allyl<br>
carbonate). These monomers may further be described as<br>
unsaturated polycarbonates of polyols, e.g., glycols. The<br>
polyol(allyl carbonate) monomer may be prepared by procedures<br>
well known in the art, e.g., as described in U.S. Patents<br>
2,370,567 and 2,403,113.<br>
In reference to general formula I, R1 is an allyl group,<br>
which may be described with reference to general formula III.<br>
The allyl group R1 of general formula I may be substituted at<br>
the 2-position with a halogen, most notably chlorine or<br>
bromine, or an alkyl group containing from 1 or 4, e.g., 1 to<br>
2, carbon atoms, in which case R2 is a substituted allyl group.<br>
More commonly, and with reference to general formula III, R4 is<br>
hydrogen and consequently R, of general formula I is the<br>
unsubstituted allyl group, H2C=CH-CH2- .<br>
With reference to general formula I, R is a polyvalent<br>
residue of a polyol, which can, for example, be an aliphatic<br>
or cycloaliphatic polyol, containing 2, 3 or 4 hydroxy groups.<br>
Typically, the polyol contains 2 hydroxy groups, i.e., a<br>
glycol. When the polyol is an aliphatic polycl, it may be<br>
linear or branched and contain from 2 to 10 carbon atoms.<br>
Commonly, the aliphatic polyol is an alkylene glycol having<br>
from 2 to 4 carbons atoms, e.g., ethylene glycol, propylene<br>
glycol, trimethylene glycol, tetramethylene glycol, or a<br>
poly(C2-C4 alkylene glycol), e.g., diethylene glycol,<br>
triethylene glycol, etc.<br>
Specific examples of polyol(allyl carbonate) monomers<br>
that may be used in the present invention include, but are not<br>
limited to, ethylene glycol bis(2-chloroallyl carbonate),<br>
ethylene glycol bis(allyl carbonate), diethylene glycol bis (2-<br>
methylallyl carbonate), diethylene glycol bis(allyl<br>
carbonate), triethylene glycol bis (allyl carbonate),, propylene<br>
glycol bis(2-ethylallyl carbonate), 1,3-propanediol bis(allyl<br>
carbonate), 1,3-butanediol bis(allyl carbonate), 1,4<br>
butanediol bis(2-bromoallyl carbonate), dipropylene glycol<br>
bis(allyl carbonate), trimethylene glycol bis(2-ethylallyl<br>
carbonate), pentamethylene glycol bis(allyl carbonate), 1,4-<br>
cyclohexanediol bis(allyl carbonate) and 4,4'-<br>
isopropylidenebiscyclohexanol bis(allyl carbonate).<br>
A preferred polyol(allyl carbonate) monomer in the<br>
composition of the present invention is diethylene glycol<br>
bis(allyl carbonate). Commercially available examples of<br>
diethylene glycol bis(allyl carbonate) monomers include CR-39®<br>
monomer and HIGH ADC CR-39® monomer, Chemical Abstracts (CAS)<br>
No. 142-22-3, available from PPG Industries, Inc.<br>
A detailed description of polyol(allyl carbonate)<br>
monomers that may be used in the polymerizable organic<br>
compositions of the present invention may be found in U.S.<br>
Patent No. 4,637,698 at column 3, line 33 through column 5,<br>
line 61. That disclosure is hereby incorporated by reference,<br>
and is summarized above.<br>
As used in the present description with reference to the<br>
radically polymerizable monomer represented by general formula<br>
I, the term "polyol(allyl carbonate) monomer" and like names,<br>
e.g., diethylene glycol bis(allyl carbonate), is intended to<br>
mean and include the named monomers or prepolymers thereof and<br>
any related monomer or oligomer species contained therein.<br>
The polyol(allyl carbonate) monomer is present in the<br>
polymerizable composition of the present invention in a major<br>
amount, e.g., from 51 percent by weight to 99.9 percent by<br>
weight, based on the total weight of the polymerizable<br>
composition. Typically, the polyol(allyl carbonate) monomer<br>
is present in the polymerizable composition of the present<br>
invention in an amount of at least 90 percent by weight,<br>
preferably at least 95 percent by weight, and more preferably<br>
at least 97 percent by weight, based on the total weight of<br>
the polymerizable composition. Also, the polyol(allyl<br>
carbonate) monomer is typically present in the composition in<br>
an amount of not greater than 99.9 percent by weight,<br>
preferably not greater than 99.8 percent by weight, and more<br>
preferably not greater than 99.7 percent by weight, based on<br>
the total weight of the polymerizable composition. The<br>
polyol(allyl carbonate) monomer may be present in the<br>
composition of the present invention in an amount ranging<br>
between any combination of these values, inclusive of the<br>
recited values.<br>
Polymerization of the polymerizable composition of the<br>
present invention may be accomplished by adding to the<br>
composition an initiating amount of material capable of<br>
generating free radicals, such as organic, peroxy compounds,<br>
i.e., an initiator. Methods for polymerizing polyol(allyl<br>
carbonate) compositions are well known to the skilled artisan<br>
and any of those well known techniques may be used to<br>
polymerize the aforedescribed polymerizable compositions.<br>
Suitable examples of organic peroxy compounds, that may<br>
be used as initiators include: peroxymonocarbonate esters,<br>
such as tertiarybutylperoxy isopropyl carbonate;<br>
peroxydicarbonate esters, such as di(2-ethylhexyl)<br>
peroxydicarbonate, di(secondary butyl) peroxydicarbonate and<br>
diisopropylperoxydicarbonate; diacylperoxides, such as 2,4-<br>
dichlorobenzoyl peroxide, isobutyryl peroxide, decanoyl<br>
peroxide, lauroyl peroxide, propionyl peroxide, acetyl<br>
peroxide, benzoyl peroxide, p-chlorobenzoyl peroxide;<br>
peroxyesters such as t-butylperoxy pivalate, t-butylperoxy<br>
octylate, and t-butylperoxyisobutyrate; methylethylketone<br>
peroxide, acetylcyclohexane sulfonyl peroxide, and<br>
azobisisobutyronitrile. Preferred initiators are those that<br>
do not discolor the resulting polymerizate. A preferred<br>
initiator is diisopropyl peroxydicarbonate.<br>
The amount of initiator used to initiate and polymerize<br>
the polymerizable compositions of the present invention may<br>
vary and will depend on the particular initiator used. Only<br>
that amount that is required to initiate and sustain the<br>
polymerization reaction is required, i.e., an initiating<br>
amount. With respect to the preferred peroxy compound,<br>
diisopropyl peroxydicarbonate, typically between 2.0 and 5.0<br>
parts of that initiator per 100 parts of the polymerizable<br>
organic composition (phm) may be used. More usually, between<br>
2.5 and 4.0 phm is used to initiate the polymerization. The<br>
amount of initiator and the consequent cure cycle should be<br>
adequate to produce a polymerizate having a 15 second Barcol<br>
hardness of at least 1, preferably, at least 4, e.g., from 4<br>
to 35. Typically, the cure cycle involves heating the<br>
polymerizable organic composition in the presence of the<br>
initiator from room temperature to 85°C over a period of from<br>
15 hours to 30 hours.<br>
Various conventional additives may be incorporated into<br>
the polymerizable composition of the present invention. Such<br>
conventional additives may include light stabilizers, heat<br>
stabilizers, ultraviolet light absorbers, mold release agents,<br>
pigments and flexibilizing additives that are net radically<br>
polymerizable, e.g., alkoxylated phenol benzoates and<br>
poly(alkylene glycol) dibenzoates. Conventional additives are<br>
typically present in the compositions of the present invention<br>
in amounts totaling less than 10 percent by weight, more<br>
typically less than 5 percent by weight, and commonly less<br>
than 3 percent by weight, based on the total weight of the<br>
polymerizable composition.<br>
Polymerizates obtained from polymerization of<br>
polymerizable organic compositions of the present invention<br>
will be solid, transparent and substantially free of tinting<br>
defects. Solid articles that may be prepared from the<br>
polymerizable compositions of the present invention include,<br>
but are not limited to, optical lenses, such as piano and<br>
ophthalmic lenses, sun lenses or sunglasses, windows,<br>
automotive transparencies, e.g., windshields, sidelights and<br>
backlights, and aircraft transparencies.<br>
In a non-limiting embodiment, a polymerizate obtained<br>
from polymerization of a polymerizable organic composition of<br>
the present invention can be used to prepare a photochromic<br>
article, such as a lens. In this embodiment, the polymerizate<br>
should be transparent to that portion of the electromagnetic<br>
spectrum which activates the photochromic substance (s)<br>
incorporated in the matrix, i.e., the wavelength of<br>
ultraviolet (UV) light that produces the colored or open form<br>
of the photochromic substance and that portion of the visible<br>
spectrum that includes the absorption maximum wavelength of<br>
the photochromic substance in its UV activated form, i.e., the<br>
open form. Non-limiting examples of photochromic substances<br>
that may be utilized with the polymerizates of the present<br>
invention can include but are not limited to organic<br>
photochromic compounds or substances containing same that may<br>
be incorporated, e.g., dissolved, dispersed or diffused into<br>
such polymerizates.<br>
In a non-limiting embodiment, suitable organic<br>
photochromic substances for use in the present invention can<br>
have an activated absorption maximum within the visible range<br>
of greater than 590 nanometers, or between greater than 590 to<br>
700 nanometers. These materials can exhibit a blue, bluish-<br>
green, or bluish-purple color when exposed to ultraviolet<br>
light in an appropriate solvent or matrix. Non-limiting<br>
examples of such substances can include but are not limited to<br>
spiro(indoline)naphthoxazines and<br>
spiro(indoline)benzoxazines. Further non-limiting examples of<br>
these and other such photochromic substances are described in<br>
the open literature. See, for example, U.S. Patents:<br>
3,562,172; 3,578,602; 4,215,010; 4,342,668; 5,405,958;<br>
4,637,698; 4,931,219; 4,816,584; 4,880,667; 4,818,096.<br>
In another non-limiting embodiment, suitable organic<br>
photochromic substances for use in the present invention can<br>
include at least one absorption maximum within the visible<br>
range of between 400 and less than 500 nanometers. In a<br>
further non-limiting embodiment, the organic photochromic<br>
substance can include two absorption maxima. These materials<br>
can exhibit a yellow-orange color when exposed to ultraviolet<br>
light in an appropriate solvent or matrix. Non-limting<br>
examples can include chromenes, such as but not limited to<br>
benzopyrans and naphthopyrans. Further non-limiting examples<br>
of such chromenes are described in the open literature, see<br>
for example, U.S. Patents 3,567,605; 4,826,977; 5,066,818;<br>
4,826,977; 5,066,818; 5,466,398; 5,384,07'?; 5,238,931; and<br>
5,274,132.<br>
In an alternate non-limiting embodiment, suitable organic<br>
photochromic substances for use in the present invention can<br>
include those having an absorption maximum within the visible<br>
range of between 400 to 500 nanometers anci another absorption<br>
maximum within the visible range of between 500 to 700<br>
nanometers. These materials can exhibit color(s) ranging from<br>
yellow/brown to purple/gray when exposed to ultraviolet light<br>
in an appropriate solvent or matrix. Non-limiting examples of<br>
these substances can include benzopyran compounds, having<br>
substituents at the 2-position of the pyran ring and a<br>
substituted or unsubstituted heterocyclic ring, such as but<br>
not limited to a benzothieno or benzofurano ring fused to the<br>
benzene portion of the benzopyran. Non-limiting examples of<br>
such materials are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,429,774.<br>
In a further non-limiting embodiment, the photochromic<br>
substance for use in the present invention can include<br>
photochromic organo-metal dithizonates, such as but not<br>
limited to (arylazo)-thioformic arylhydrazidates, such as but<br>
not limited to mercury dithizonates which are described in,<br>
for example, U.S. Patent 3,361,706; and fulgides and<br>
fulgimides, such as but not limited to 3-furyl and 3-thienyl<br>
fulgides and fulgimides which are described in U.S. Patent<br>
4,931,220 at column 20, line 5 through cclumn 21, line 38.<br>
In a non-limiting embodiment, the photochromic substance<br>
for use in the present invention can include at least one<br>
naphthopyran. In a further non-limiting embodiment, the<br>
photochromic substance can include a mixture of at least two<br>
naphthopyrans.<br>
The specific disclosures relating to such photochromic<br>
substances in the aforedescribed patents are incorporated<br>
herein, in toto, by reference. The photochromic articles of<br>
the present invention can include one photochromic substance<br>
or a mixture of photochromic substances, as can be appreciated<br>
by one skilled in the art. In a non-limiting embodiment, a<br>
mixture of photochromic substances can be used to attain an<br>
activated color such as a near neutral gray or brown.<br>
Each of the photochromic substances described herein can<br>
be used in an amount and in a ratio (i.e., when mixtures are<br>
used) such that a polymerizate to which the photochromic<br>
substance is applied or incorporated exhibits a desired<br>
resultant color. In a non-limiting embodiment, a photochromic<br>
substance can be applied on or incorporated into the<br>
polymerizate to produce a substantially neutral color such as<br>
a shade of gray or brown when activated with unfiltered<br>
sunlight. The relative amounts of the aforesaid photochromic<br>
substances used can vary and depend upon the relative<br>
intensities of the color of the activated species of such<br>
compounds, and the ultimate color desired.<br>
The photochromic compounds or substances described herein<br>
can be applied to or incorporated into the polymerizate by<br>
various methods described in the art. In a non-limiting<br>
embodiment, the photochromic substance can be dissolved or<br>
dispersed within the polymerizate, such as imbibition of the<br>
photochromic substance into the polymerizate by immersion of<br>
the polymerizate in a hot solution of the photochromic<br>
substance or by thermal transfer. In an alternate embodiment,<br>
the photochromic substance can be a separate layer between<br>
adjacent layers of the polymerizate, such as a part of a<br>
polymer film. In another alternate embodiment, the<br>
photochromic substance can be applied as a coating or as part<br>
of a coating placed on the surface of the polymerizate. As<br>
used herein and the claims, the term "imbibition" or "imbibe"<br>
includes the permeation of the photochromic substance alone<br>
into the polymerizate, solvent assisted transfer absorption of<br>
the photochromic substance into a porous polymer, vapor phase<br>
transfer, and other such transfer mechanisms.<br>
In a non-limiting embodiment, imbibition of the<br>
photochromic substance into the polymerizate can include<br>
coating the photochromic article with the photochromic<br>
substance; heating the surface of the photochromic article;<br>
and removing the residual coating from the surface of the<br>
photochromic article.<br>
The amount of photochromic substance or composition<br>
containing the same, applied to or incorporated into the<br>
polymerizate is not critical and can vary widely. In general,<br>
the amount should be sufficient to produce a photochromic<br>
effect discernible to the naked eye upon activation. Such<br>
amount can be referred to as a photochromic amount. The<br>
particular amount used can depend upon the intensity of color<br>
desired upon irradiation thereof and upon the method used to<br>
incorporate or apply the photochromic substances. Typically,<br>
the more photochromic substance applied or incorporated, the<br>
greater is the color intensity. In a non-limiting embodiment,<br>
the amount of total photochromic substance incorporated into<br>
or applied to a photochromic optical polymerizate may range<br>
from 0.15 to 0.35 milligrams per square centimeter of surface<br>
to which the photochromic substance is incorporated or<br>
applied.<br>
In a non-limiting embodiment, the photochromic substance<br>
can be added prior to polymerizing, e.g., cast curing, a<br>
polymerizable organic composition of the present invention.<br>
In this embodiment, the photochromic substance can be chosen<br>
such that it is essentially resistant to potentially adverse<br>
interactions with initiator(s) that may be present and/or the<br>
isocyanate, isothiocyante and amine groups of the first and<br>
second components. These adverse interactions can result in<br>
deactivation of the photochromic substance, e.g., by trapping<br>
them in either an open or closed form.<br>
In a non-limiting embodiment, suitable photochromic<br>
substances for use in the present invention can include<br>
photochromic pigments and organic photochromic substances<br>
encapsulated in metal oxides, the latter of which are<br>
described in U.S. Patents 4,166,043 and 4,367,170. In a<br>
further non-limiting embodiment, organic photochromic<br>
substances sufficiently encapsulated within a matrix of an<br>
organic polymerizate, as described in U.S. Patent 4,931,220,<br>
can be incorporated into the multi-component composition of<br>
the present invention prior to curing. In another non-<br>
limiting embodiment, the photochromic substance can be<br>
incorporated into the second component prior to mixing the<br>
first and second components together.<br>
The present invention is more particularly described in<br>
the following examples, which are intended to be illustrative<br>
only, since numerous modifications and variations therein will<br>
be apparent to those skilled in the art. Unless otherwise<br>
specified, all parts and percentages are by weight.<br>
Casting Composition Examples<br>
The following summarizes polymerizable casting<br>
compositions that are comparative and compositions that are in<br>
accordance with the present invention. Casting composition A<br>
is a comparative composition, and Casting compositions B and C<br>
represent compositions according to the present invention.<br>
(a) CR-39® diethylene glycol bis(allyl carbonate) monomer<br>
available commercially from PPG Industries, Inc.<br>
(b) In each of casting compositions B and C, the level of<br>
diisopropyl peroxydicarbonate initiator was adjusted such that<br>
tinted polymerizates obtained from these compositions had<br>
substantially the same percent transmission as tinted<br>
polymerizates obtained (under the same tinting conditions)<br>
from composition A, e.g., having about 35 percent<br>
transmission. The percent transmittance was determined using<br>
a HunterLab Model ColorQuest II colorimeter employing the CIE<br>
Tristimulus XYZ scale, illuminant D65 and 10°C observer.<br>
(c) Diallyl urethane monomer obtained from Sartomer Company,<br>
Inc. and having the designation NTX-4434.<br>
(d) Tetraallyl urethane monomer obtained from Sartomer<br>
Company, Inc. and having the designation NTX-4439.<br>
Cast Lens Examples<br>
The casting compositions A - C were each mixed, at room<br>
temperature and injected separately into glass lens molds used<br>
to prepare circular lenses having a +5 diopter and an outer<br>
rim diameter of 6.5 cm. Twenty (20) lens molds were filled at<br>
a time and their contents polymerized using the same cure<br>
cycle. The cure cycle used involved heating the molds in an<br>
electric forced air oven in stages from 48°C to 85 °C over a<br>
period of 18 hours, followed by cooling to and holding at 60°C<br>
until demolding of the lenses.<br>
The cast lenses were then tinted by imbibing them with a<br>
black dye. An aqueous tinting solution of 1 part BPI®<br>
Molecular Catalytic™ Black Dye, commercially available from<br>
Brain Power Incorporated, and 10 parts deionized water was<br>
heated to and held at a temperature of 94°C - 95°C. The<br>
lenses cast from casting compositions A - C were fully<br>
immersed in the heated dye solution for a period of 5 minutes,<br>
after which they were thoroughly rinsed with deionized water.<br>
The tinted lenses were evaluated for tinting defects, the<br>
results of which are summarized in Table 1.<br>
(e) The lenses were evaluated for tinting defects by means of<br>
visual naked eye inspection. Tinting defects were observed as<br>
having a lighter colored vein or fern-like appearance relative<br>
to the rest of the tinted lens.<br>
(f) 100 x (the number of tinted lenses observed to have<br>
tinting defects / the number of tinted lenses evaluated). For<br>
example, with casting composition A: 100 x (57/228) = 25<br>
percent (%).<br>
The results summarized in Table 1 show that articles,<br>
e.g., lenses, cast from polymerizable compositions according<br>
to the present invention, such as Compositions B and C, have<br>
fewer tinting defects than lenses cast from comparative<br>
compositions, such as Composition A.<br>
Photochromic Article Example<br>
In 98.5 grams of diethylene glycol bis(allyl carbonate)<br>
monomer (mid ADC grade), commercially available from PPG<br>
Industries, Inc. under the designation CR-39® monomer, was<br>
blended 1.5 gm of tetraallyl urethane monomer (TAU)using a<br>
magnetic bar. The TAU was obtained from Sartomer Company,<br>
Inc. under the designation NTX-4439. The mixture was blended<br>
for about 30 minutes. To this blend was added 2.8 gm of<br>
diisopropyl peroxydicarbonate (IPP) as a free radical<br>
initiator. The mixture was then blended for an additional 10<br>
minutes.<br>
A control sample was prepared using the same procedure<br>
with the exception that the sample did not contain TAU<br>
monomer.<br>
The resulting mixtures were poured between two flat glass<br>
sheets and cured by heating the sheets in an electric forced<br>
air oven in stages from 48°C to 85°C over a period of 18<br>
hours, followed by cooling to and holding at 60°C. The flat<br>
sheets were cut into 1.5" x 1.5" square samples which were<br>
used for photochromic dye imbibition. A photochromic dye was<br>
prepared and imbibed at a temperature of 135°C, for a time<br>
period of 4 hours.<br>
Imbibition Coating<br>
The following photochromic mixture was used in the<br>
imbibition coating. The total concentration of photochromic<br>
in the coating was 4 weight percent. The materials were added<br>
in the order and manner shown below, to a vessel equipped with<br>
an agitator and a means for heating.<br>

The imbibition coating was imbibed into the sample sheets<br>
by applying a film of the imbibition coating onto the surface<br>
of the sample sheets. The film was applied by spin coating.<br>
The applied film was allowed to dry. The sample sheets were<br>
then heated in a hot-air oven at 135-140°C for 4 hours. After<br>
cooling, the resin film was removed from the test samples by<br>
rinsing with water and wiping with an acetone soaked tissue.<br>
The samples were screened for ultraviolet absorbance and<br>
test samples having comparable UV absorbance at 390 nanometers<br>
were tested for photochromic response on an optical bench. The<br>
ultraviolet absorbance value gives an indication of the amount<br>
of photochromic compounds in the sample. The optical bench was<br>
maintained at a temperature of 72°F (22°c) . The sample sheets<br>
imbibed with the imbibition coating were activated for 15<br>
minutes and the Percent Transmission (%Ta) was measured after<br>
15 minutes.<br>
Prior to testing on the optical bench, the photochromic<br>
samples were exposed to 365 nanometer ultraviolet light for<br>
about 2 0 minutes to activate the photochromic compounds and<br>
then placed in a 75°C oven for about 20 minutes to bleach<br>
(inactivate) the photochromic compounds. The samples were then<br>
cooled to room temperature, exposed to fluorescent room<br>
lighting for at least 3 hours and then kept covered for at<br>
least 1 hour prior to testing on an optical bench. The bench<br>
was fitted with a 300 watt Xenon arc lamp, a remote controlled<br>
shutter, a Schott 3mm KG-2 band- pass filter, which removes<br>
short wavelength radiation, neutral density filter(s), a<br>
quartz water cell/sample holder for maintaining sample<br>
temperature in which the sample to be tested was inserted.<br>
Measurements were made on the optical bench in the<br>
Photochromic Performance Test with the power output adjusted<br>
to 0.67 milliwatts per square centimeter (mW/cm2).<br>
The power output was measured using a GRASEBY Optronics<br>
Model S-371 portable photometer (Serial #21536) with a UV-A<br>
detector (Serial # 224l4)or comparable equipment. The UV-A<br>
detector was placed into the sample holder and the light<br>
output was measured. Adjustments to the power output were made<br>
by increasing or decreasing the lamp wattage or by adding or<br>
removing neutral density filters in the light path.<br>
A monitoring, collimated beam of light from a tungsten lamp<br>
was passed through the sample at 30° normal to the surface of<br>
the lens. After passing through the sample sheet, the light<br>
from the tungsten lamp was directed through a photopic filter<br>
attached to a detector. The output signals from the detector<br>
were processed by a radiometer. The control of the test<br>
conditions and acquisition of data was handled by the Labtech<br>
Notebook Pro software and the recommended I/O board.<br>
The results are shown in Table 2 below.<br>
These results show that TAU has a significant effect on<br>
the photochromic imbibition when compared with a control<br>
sample.<br>
