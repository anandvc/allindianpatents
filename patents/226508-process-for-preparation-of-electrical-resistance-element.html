				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a new electrical resistance-heating element of<br>
molybdenum silicide type intended to use in connection with sintering of metal powder.<br>
Resistance-heating elements of the above-mentioned kind are existing since the 1950ies<br>
for instance with the trademark Kanthal Super. These consist usually mainly of a metal<br>
like phase of MoSi2, alternatively of MoxW1-xSi2 and also an oxide phase of type<br>
aluminum silicate. Similar types of material can be used at element temperatures up to<br>
1900°C in oxidizing atmosphere.<br>
What makes this high working temperature possible is, besides the high melting point of<br>
the material (over 2000°C), the oxide layer of SiO2, which will be formed and rapidly<br>
makes the basic material passive against accelerating oxidation and by this makes a long<br>
service time for the heating element possible. This outer layer gives a lasting protection<br>
in several furnace- and heat treating atmospheres, as air, oxygen, nitrogen/ hydrogen<br>
gas, cracked ammonia, and others. Conditions that often limit the use in these<br>
atmospheres are, when a high temperature of the element is prevailing simultaneous<br>
with a too low potential of oxygen, alternatively dew point, in the atmosphere. What<br>
happens if the critical proportions between dew point - temperature of the element is<br>
exceeded is, that the SiCVlayer becomes unstable and by that after a certain time does<br>
not give any protection of the base material. For instance in hydrogen gas this occurs at<br>
an element temperature of 1300°C when the dew point is lower than about -30°C. To<br>
keep the SiO2-layer remaining stable at a temperature of the element of 1450°C, a dew<br>
point over +20°C is required, i.e. a hydrogen gas containing more than 2.3 percent by<br>
volume. The stability properties of the SiO2-layer make up a restriction of the usage of<br>
the element in certain connections.<br>
An application example where such limitation manifests itself is at sintering of metal<br>
powder in order to produce stainless steel. Components of the stainless steel grade<br>
AISI3 16L are above all produced by pressing of powder, alternatively by injection<br>
moulding of metal powder. After evaporation of the binding agent at a low temperature<br><br>
often a final sintering in the ringc of temperature between 1300-1360°C in reduced<br>
atmosphere is required. The reducing gas can be pure hydrogen gas with a dew point at<br>
-40°C to -60oC, corresponding about 0.01 and 0.001 percent by volume of water<br>
respectively. The low dew point has to be obtained in order to reduce metal oxides<br>
during sintering process and by that resulting in that a material with high density and<br>
good mechanical properties, fn such an application example an element temperature<br>
between 1400 and 1550°C should be required, dependent on the element shape and<br>
furnace design. Under those conditions the SiO2-layer is consequently not stable on<br>
heating elements based on MoSi2.<br>
Heating elements which are used today in many furnaces for sintering of metal powder<br>
in the temperature range over 1250-1300°C are manufactured of above all molybdenum,<br>
but also of tungsten. A limitation of this material is, besides its relatively high total cost<br>
in furnaces, the requirement to hold the elements under all circumstances over 400°C in<br>
an atmosphere deficient in oxygen to avoid, that detrimental oxidation of the pure<br>
molybdenum metal occurs. For example at leakage of furnaces or other breakdowns<br>
those elements can consequently be damaged.<br>
The alternative materials, which exist for electrical resistance heating under these<br>
conditions, are alloys and intermetallic compounds as FeCrAl, NiCr and MoSi2 (e.g.<br>
Kanthal Super as above). The limitations of MoSi2-material were described above.<br>
FeCrAl and NiCr form oxides of Al2O3 and Cr2O3 respectively on the surface under use<br>
in air. In reducing atmosphere, as dry hydrogen gas, the range of temperature under use<br>
is limited to about 1400°C for FeCrAl and 1250°C for for example NiCr of the<br>
trademark Nicrothal 80 respectively.<br>
In case of NiCr-alloys the Cr2CO3 is not stable above this temperature. In case of FeCrAl<br>
the Al2O3-layer certainly remains stable, but the service time of the material at this<br>
temperature is limited by the closely allied smelting temperature of about 1500°C. Thus,<br>
if the FeCrAl should be used for sintering of 316L, the requirements for high element<br>
temperatures would lead to very limited service times.<br><br>
It would be desirable to use a material that combines the possibility to form alumina on<br>
the surface with a melting temperature considerable higher than 1500aC and by that, if<br>
necessary alternating could be used in reducing and oxidizing atmosphere. Besides, then<br>
the disadvantages of the molybdenum elements could be eliminated since the elements<br>
not always have to be used in an atmosphere deficient in oxygen.<br>
It has surprisingly shown, that by alloying M0S12 with Al in a sufficient quantity and<br>
also an alumina phase, a phase of molybdenum alumina silicide, Mo(Sii-xAlx)2 is<br>
obtained, which is stable in dry hydrogen gas at high temperatures. It has for example<br>
shown under a corrosion test in hydrogen gas at 1450°C, that the compound material<br>
MoSi 1 6Al0.4/Al2O3 does not show any corrosion after 200 hours, but an insignificant<br>
weight increase of 0.2%, which replies to an oxidation of aluminum in the<br>
aluminosliiicide into Al2O3. In a comparing investigation with Kanthal Super 1800,<br>
consisting of MoSi2 and about 20 percent by volume of aluminum silicate it has shown,<br>
that the weight was reduced with about 30% under the same conditions. In this case<br>
besides the SiO2-layer both the MoSi2-phase, Mo5Si3 and Mo3Si and also the aluminum<br>
silicate containing binding agent were reduced.<br>
DESCTRIPTION OF ACCOMPANYING DRAWING<br>
It is reasonable to assume that even other compositions can be used to obtain similar<br>
results. For instance it has shown, that MoSi1.75Alo.25/Al2O3 forms Al2O3 under<br>
oxidation in air at 1200°C. At values for x in the range of 0.1-0.6 the hexagonal, so<br>
called C-40-phase of Mo(Si,Al)2, is stable. It is reasonable to assume that the present<br>
invention even could be applied with those compositions. The value of x should amount<br>
to 0.10-0.60, preferably 0.20-0.55. It is also beyond all doubt, that molybdenum could<br>
be substituted by tungsten to Mo1-yWySi1.xAlx under maintenance of the desirable<br>
properties for sintering of metal powder. Herewith y should amount to a numerical<br>
value in the range of 0-0.4, preferably 0.05-0.20. Substitution of Mo with W can be<br>
done with maintained crystal structure, Cl 1, and thereby increase the service<br>
temperature of the heating element with the composition Mo1-yWySi2. This is applied for<br>
instance for heating elements with the trademark Kantahl Super 1900, which in<br>
similarity with Kantha! Super 1800 form SlO2 on the surface. Analogous the C-40-<br>
phase will be formed even at alloying of the aluminum at the substitution of<br><br>
moljybdenum with tungsten according to Mo1.yWySii.xAlx. The remaining phases, which<br>
can be formed at high x-values, in the system Mo-Si-Al are for example aluminides of<br>
molybdenum, which appears from the phase diagram Figure 1, valid at 1823 K.<br>
Under experimental work in connection with the present invention it was proved<br>
suitable, that the silicide phase amounts to between 65 and 95 percent by weight of the<br>
total weight of the resistance element, preferably between 75 and 85 percent by weight.<br>
As mentioned above, the resistance element contains besides the silicide phase alumina<br>
too.<br>
The balance can consist of SiO2, suitably between 0 and 1 percent by weight.<br>
The above-described invention could also be used in other sintering applications, where<br>
low oxygen potential, alternatively a low dew point, is required. This is sometimes the<br>
case at sintering of powder of tungsten heavy alloy, certain types of alloys of titanium<br>
and intermetallic compounds, and also of low alloyed steels. For instance the heavy<br>
alloy W-Cu have been sintered in hydrogen at 1400°C with a dew point at -36oC.<br>
The above mentioned formed alumina is expected to be stable up to about 1595°C,<br>
which is the eutectic temperature in the system SiO2-3Al2O3-2SiO2 (mullite). This oxide<br>
is expected to have different corrosion properties than the pure alumina. Up to at least<br>
the temperature of the element of around 1595°C could thereby this material constitute a<br>
general alternative to the heating elements of molybdenum-type.<br><br>
