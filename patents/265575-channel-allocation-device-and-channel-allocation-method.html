SPECIFICATION<br>
TITLE OF THE INVENTION<br>
CHANNEL ASSIGNMENT APPARATUS AND CHANNEL<br>
ASSIGNMENT METHOD<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a channel<br>
assignment apparatus and a channel assignment method.<br>
More particularly, the present invention relates to<br>
a technique for dynamically assigning required<br>
resources on a radio physical channel in which there<br>
is correspondence relationship between logical<br>
channels and the radio channel.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
A channel assignment method in W-CDMA is<br>
described (refer to non-patent documents 1 and 2,<br>
for example).<br>
In W-CDMA, as shown in Fig.l, there are<br>
three types of function channels, which are, logical<br>
channels that are function channels defined between<br>
RLC and MAC, transport channels that are function<br>
channels defined between MAC and Physical, and<br>
physical channels that are function channels defined<br>
in Physical layer.<br>
The logical channels include BCCH, PCCH,<br>
CCCH, MCCH, DCCH, MSCH, MTCH and DTCH etc. CCH is<br>
used for control, TCH is used for traffic<br>
communication, and MCCH, MSCH and MTCH are used for<br>
MBMS.<br>
The transport channels include BCH, PCH,<br>
FACH, RACH, DCH and HS-DSCH etc. BCH, PCH, FACH and<br>
HS-DSCH are downlink transport channels, RACH is an<br>
uplink transport channel, and DCH is a bidirectional<br>
transport channel used in uplink and downlink.<br>
The physical channels include PCCPCH,<br>
SCCPCH, DPCH, PRACH, HS-PDSCH, SCH, CPICH, AICH,<br><br>
-2-<br>
PICH, HS-SCCH and HS-DPCCH etc. PCCPCH is a<br>
downlink physical channel and is prepared for<br>
transmitting BCH (broadcast information). SCCPCH is<br>
a downlink physical channel and is prepared for<br>
transmitting FACH and PCH (paging information). In<br>
W-CDMA, SCCPCH (to which FACH and PCH are mapped) is<br>
provided as a radio physical channel to which almost<br>
all of the logical channels can be mapped.<br>
By the way, in a connection sequence, a UE<br>
is identified by an identifier (TMSI) in a L3 (RRC)<br>
layer. Therefore, since there is no individual<br>
correspondence relationship in L2 (UE cannot be<br>
identified in a L2 level), the CCCH (common control<br>
channel) is used as the logical channel. After<br>
establishment of the RRC connection, since an<br>
identifier (C- or H-RNTI) in L2 is assigned from RAN,<br>
it is identified in L2 after that, and the logical<br>
channel becomes DCCH (dedicated control channel).<br>
RRC connection establishment is described.<br>
"RRC Connection Request" that is a control signal<br>
when establishing the RRC connection is transmitted<br>
using CCCH as a logical channel and using PRACH as a<br>
radio physical channel. In addition, also "RRC<br>
Connection Setup" is transmitted using CCCH as a<br>
logical channel and using SCCPCH as a radio physical<br>
channel. Since RNTI assigned from RAN is included<br>
in the "RRC Connection Setup" message for<br>
transmission, RRC Connection is established in<br>
signaling after that. Therefore, DCCH is used for<br>
logical channel transmission. The radio physical<br>
channel is transmitted on DPCH. When performing RRC<br>
Connection Setup Confirm, a transmission route to be<br>
prepared is SDCCH (for signaling), and a radio<br>
channel for U-plane transmission is not prepared.<br>
Therefore, when performing RRC Connection Setup, the<br>
radio channel is changed in RRC signaling. A radio<br>
physical channel for U-plane transmission is set by<br><br>
-3-<br>
Radio Bearer Setup. That is, a channel is added by<br>
the RRC signaling.<br>
A channel assignment method in PDC is<br>
described (refer to non-patent document 3, for<br>
example).<br>
There are following function channels in<br>
PDC. That is, there are traffic channels (TCH) for<br>
transmitting user information and control channels<br>
(CCH). The control channels include BCCH, CCCH (PCH,<br>
SCCH), UPCH and ACCH (SACCH, FACCH).<br>
In PDC, the function channels are mapped<br>
to one radio channel. On the radio channel,<br>
locations (slots) where the traffic channels (TCH)<br>
and control channels (CCH) can be mapped are limited<br>
in terms of time. In addition, only one type of<br>
function channel can be mapped to slots where the<br>
control channels can be mapped.<br>

[non-patent document 3] RCR STD-27 PERSONAL<br>
DIGITAL CELLULAR TELECOMMUNICATION SYSTEM<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION<br>
However, in the above-mentioned background<br>
art, there are following problems.<br>
In W-CDMA, there are three channel layers<br>
of logical channels, transport channels and physical<br>
channels. A logical channel is mapped to a<br>
transport channel, and a transport channel is mapped<br>
to a physical channel.<br>
Almost all of logical channels can be<br>
assigned to SCCPCH (low speed radio physical channel<br>
basically). However, DCCH and DTCH can be mapped<br>
not only to FACH(SCCPCH), but also to DPCH (DCH) or<br>
HS-DSCH (HS-PDSCH). Therefore, as protocol states,<br>
states called CELL FACH and CELL DCH are defined,<br><br>
-4-<br>
and transition among the states occurs by L3<br>
signaling according to traffic amounts. Thus, it is<br>
necessary to define the protocol states (CELL_FACH<br>
and CELL_DCH), which causes increase of the number<br>
of test processes, increase of signaling (procedures<br>
and messages) for causing transition among protocol<br>
states, channel transition delay and data loss.<br>
On the other hand, almost all of logical<br>
channels can be transmitted on the SCCPCH basically.<br>
But, UE that receives a signal on the SCCPCH<br>
basically receives the radio channel continuously,<br>
and after demodulating data, the UE discards<br>
corresponding TB when the data is not addressed to<br>
the own UE. Thus, battery consumption becomes a<br>
problem especially for a case of U-plane data.<br>
In addition, PS (Packet Switched) -<br>
oriented data communication society will come with<br>
the development of multimedia communications<br>
technology in the future, and, when high speed data<br>
transmission is necessary, SCCPCH does not match the<br>
mobile communication environment in the future since<br>
SCCPCH is basically a low speed common channel<br>
(channel that all UE in the cell can receive).<br>
In W-CDMA, the radio physical channel is<br>
clearly defined by code, and the resources cannot be<br>
shared among channels.<br>
Only HS-DSCH (transport channel) can be<br>
mapped to HS-PDSCH (physical channel), and any other<br>
transport channel (such as PCH and BCH, for example)<br>
cannot be mapped. Only DCCH and DTCH can be mapped<br>
to HS-DSCH, and other logical channels cannot be<br>
mapped to HS-DSCH since identification of UE in the<br>
L2 level is difficult. Therefore, even though there<br>
are available resources, required resources cannot<br>
be assigned to the other logical channels.<br>
Considering connection sequences, as to<br>
signaling in the RRC Connection establishment<br><br>
-5-<br>
process, CCCH (common control channel) is<br>
transmitted using PRACH in an uplink communication,<br>
and is transmitted using SCCPCH in a returning<br>
downlink communication. As to signaling after RRC<br>
Connection is established, DCCH is transmitted on<br>
DPCH. Accordingly, in W-CDMA, radio physical<br>
channels are defined according to characteristics of<br>
logical channels, and change of radio physical<br>
channels is performed in the signaling of RRC. In<br>
addition, in W-CDMA, since a logical channel<br>
(bearer) for U-plane transmission is added after<br>
signaling, L3 signaling is also used for that.<br>
Before establishment of RRC Connection,<br>
identification of UE is performed using an<br>
identifier of L3 (TMSI in particular). After<br>
establishment of RRC Connection, identification of<br>
UE is performed using an identifier of L2 (RNTI in<br>
particular). Therefore, transition to a dedicated<br>
channel can be performed only in a state after RRC<br>
Connection is established. Therefore, since UE<br>
identification methods in signaling are different<br>
between in RRC Connection establishment process and<br>
after that, the channel of the radio physical layer<br>
is reconfigured in W-CDMA. In accordance with that,<br>
there is necessity to define protocol states.<br>
On the other hand, in PDC, although<br>
function channels are mapped to one radio channel,<br>
the control channel cannot be placed in slots for<br>
communication channel. On the other hand, a<br>
communication channel cannot be placed in slots for<br>
control channel. Therefore, when there is no<br>
information to be transmitted using the slots of the<br>
control channel, waste of resources occurs. In<br>
addition, since only one type of function channel<br>
can be placed in slots where the control channel can<br>
be placed, a plurality of types of function channels<br>
cannot be placed. Therefore, only by the one type<br><br>
-6-<br>
of function channel, surplus of resources occurs and<br>
waste of resources occurs since transmission speed<br>
increases in a mobile communication system after 3G.<br>
An object of the present invention is to<br>
provide a channel assignment apparatus and a channel<br>
assignment method that can sequentially assign radio<br>
resources on a radio physical channel according to<br>
occurrence of traffic on logical channels.<br>
MEANS FOR SOLVING THE PROBLEM<br>
For solving the problem, the channel<br>
assignment apparatus of the present invention is a<br>
channel assignment apparatus for assigning a<br>
plurality of logical channels to a radio physical<br>
channel between a radio access network and a<br>
terminal, wherein, the logical channels includes a<br>
logical channel for control and a logical channel<br>
for data transmission, the radio physical channel<br>
can be commonly used for a plurality of logical<br>
channels, and one logical channel has a<br>
correspondence relationship with one radio physical<br>
channel, and the channel assignment apparatus<br>
includes, as one of characteristics: traffic<br>
monitoring detection means that detects occurrence<br>
of traffic of the logical channels; and logical<br>
channel assignment means that, according to<br>
occurrence of the traffic of the logical channels,<br>
sequentially assigns required resources on the radio<br>
physical channel to the logical channels.<br>

logical channels are associated with one radio<br>
physical channel, so that, according to traffic<br>
occurrence in the logical channels, required radio<br>
resources can be sequentially assigned to the<br>
logical channels on the radio physical channel.<br>
In addition, the channel assignment method<br>
of the present invention is a channel assignment<br><br>

detecting occurrence of traffic of the logical<br>
channels; and an assigning step of, according to the<br>
occurrence of the traffic of the logical channels,<br>
sequentially assigning required resources on the<br>
radio physical channel to the logical channels.<br>
By configuring like this, a plurality of<br>
logical channels are associated with one radio<br>
physical channel, so that, according to traffic<br>
occurrence in the logical channels, required radio<br>
resources can be sequentially assigned to the<br>
logical channels on the radio physical channel.<br>

PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
Next, preferred embodiments for carrying<br>
out the present invention are described with<br>
reference to figures based on the following<br>
embodiments.<br>
By the way, in all figures for describing<br>
the embodiments, same reference symbols are used for<br>
parts having same functions, and repeated<br>
descriptions are not provided.<br>
A communication system according to an<br>
embodiment of the present invention is described<br>
with reference to Fig.2.<br><br>
-9-<br>
The communication system (radio access<br>
network) assumed in the present embodiment includes<br>
a transmission apparatus 100 (100i, 1002, 1003) , a<br>
radio network controller 200 connected to the<br>
transmission apparatus 100, and a receiving<br>
apparatus 300 (300i, 3002, 3003, 3004, 3005, 3006) .<br>
The transmission apparatus 100 includes a channel<br>
assignment apparatus.<br>
The communication system forms a service<br>
area (cell in the case of radio communication) to<br>
enable the transmission apparatus 100 and the<br>
receiving apparatus 300 to perform exchange of<br>
information.<br>
A radio channel that can be shared by a<br>
plurality of receiving apparatuses is defined as a<br>
channel for transmission from the transmission<br>
apparatus 100 to the receiving apparatus 300 between<br>
the transmission apparatus 100 and the receiving<br>
apparatus 300. Every logical channel can be<br>
transmitted using this radio channel.<br>
Although the transmission apparatus 100<br>
and the receiving apparatus 300 are defined as a<br>
transmission apparatus and a receiving apparatus<br>
that transmit information via a radio link in the<br>
present embodiment, a transmission route between the<br>
transmission apparatus and the receiving apparatus<br>
is not limited to radio.<br>
In addition, although transmission in a<br>
downlink direction from the transmission apparatus<br>
100 to the receiving apparatus 300 is particularly<br>
described in the present embodiment, the present<br>
embodiment can be also applied to transmission in an<br>
uplink direction from the receiving apparatus 300 to<br>
the transmission apparatus 100 and is not limited to<br>
transmission in the downlink direction.<br>
Next, correspondences between function<br>
channels and a physical channel, and a radio<br><br>
-10-<br>
physical channel configuration that are assumed in<br>
the present embodiment are described with reference<br>
to Fig.3.<br>
The image of correspondences between<br>
logical channels (or function channels) and a<br>
physical channel assumed in the present embodiment<br>
is described using logical channels and a radio<br>
physical channel provided in W-CDMA.<br>
The logical channels (or function<br>
channels) assumed in the present embodiment includes<br>
BCCH, PCCH, MCCH, DCCH, CCCH, DTCH, MSCH and MTCH.<br>
CCH indicates a logical channel for control and TCH<br>
indicates a logical channel for data transmission.<br>
MCCH, MSCH and MTCH are used for MBMS communication,<br>
that is, multicast broadcast communication. The<br>
logical channels are not limited to these, and may<br>
increase or decrease compared with these.<br>
On the other hand, as a radio physical<br>
channel, E-DSCH (Evolution-Downlink Shared Channel)<br>
that is a downlink radio physical channel that can<br>
be shared among UEs is prepared. On the E-DSCH, all<br>
of the downlink logical channels of BCCH, PCCH, MCCH,<br>
DCCH, CCCH, MTCH, MSCH and DTCH can be transmitted.<br>
That is, the radio physical channel can be commonly<br>
used for a plurality of logical channels.<br>
Although only E-DSCH is described as the<br>
radio physical channel, the radio physical channel<br>
is not limited to this, and there are a control<br>
channel associated with E-DSCH and an uplink channel.<br>
Each of BCCH, PCCH, MCCH, DCCH, CCCH, MSCH, MTCH and<br>
DTCH has a unique correspondence relationship with<br>
the E-PDSCH. That is, one logical channel has a<br>
correspondence relationship with one radio channel.<br>
Although the present embodiment is<br>
described focusing on the downlink channels, it is<br>
not limited to the downlink channels.<br>
In addition, transport channels defined in<br><br>
-11-<br>
W-CDMA are not described. That is, a configuration<br>
may be adopted in which there is a transport channel<br>
between a logical channel and a physical channel, or<br>
a configuration may be adopted in which there is no<br>
transport channel between a logical channel and a<br>
physical channel. In the case in which there is the<br>
transport channel, a plurality of logical channels<br>
may be mapped to one transport channel or may be<br>
distributed to a plurality of transport channels.<br>
Next, a configuration of a radio physical<br>
channel assumed in the present embodiment is<br>
described with reference to Fig.4.<br>
It is assumed that positions, on the radio<br>
physical channel (E-DSCH), at which required radio<br>
resources can be assigned to corresponding logical<br>
channels are transmission timing 1 - transmission<br>
timing 14. The number of the transmission timings<br>
is not limited to 14, and may be more than that or<br>
smaller than that. In addition, the radio physical<br>
channel is divided by code so that a plurality of<br>
radio physical channels can be provided.<br>
For example, at the transmission timing 1,<br>
when there is traffic of the broadcast control<br>
channel (BCCH), required radio resources can be<br>
assigned to the BCCH. That is, the broadcast<br>
control channel (BCCH) can be assigned to a<br>
particular position on the radio physical channel,<br>
for example, to the transmission timing 1. But,<br>
when there is no traffic of the BCCH, if traffic<br>
occurs in a logical channel other than the broadcast<br>
control channel or the paging control channel,<br>
required radio resources can be assigned to the<br>
logical channel at the transmission timing 1.<br>
In addition, for example, at transmission<br>
timing 2, when there is traffic of the paging<br>
control channel (PCCH), it is possible to assign<br>
required radio resources to the PCCH. That is, the<br><br>
-12-<br>
paging control channel (PCCH) can be assigned to a<br>
particular position on the radio physical channel,<br>
that is, assigned to the transmission timing 2, for<br>
example. But, when there is no traffic of the PCCH,<br>
if traffic occurs in a logical channel other than<br>
the broadcast control channel or the paging control<br>
channel, required radio resources can be assigned to<br>
the logical channel at the transmission timing 2.<br>
At each transmission timing other than the<br>
transmission timings 1 and 2, as for every logical<br>
channel other than BCCH or PCCH, when traffic occurs<br>
in a logical channel, required radio resources can<br>
be assigned to the logical channel. That is, a<br>
logical channel other than the logical channels used<br>
for the broadcast information and the paging<br>
information can be assigned to an arbitrary position<br>
of the radio physical channel.<br>
Next, a transmission apparatus of the<br>
present embodiment is described with reference to<br>
Fig.5.<br>
The transmission apparatus 100 of the<br>
present embodiment includes a channel assignment<br>
apparatus. The channel assignment apparatus<br>
includes a control unit 102, and a traffic<br>
monitoring unit 104, a resource monitoring unit 106,<br>
a transmission timing monitoring unit 108, a logical<br>
channel type determination unit 110, a logical<br>
channel assignment unit 112 and a logical channel<br>
transmission unit 114 that are connected to the<br>
control unit 102. The radio assignment apparatus<br>
assigns, to a radio physical channel, a plurality of<br>
logical channels necessary for establishing radio<br>
links, maintaining the radio links and transmitting<br>
data between a radio access network (RAN) and a<br>
terminal (UE).<br>
The control unit 102 performs control on<br>
each function entity to control the transmission<br><br>
-13-<br>
apparatus 100 as a whole.<br>
The traffic monitoring unit 104 performs<br>
monitoring to determine whether there is a logical<br>
channel in which traffic occurs among logical<br>
channels that can be mapped to the radio physical<br>
channel.<br>
The resource monitoring unit 106 performs<br>
monitoring to determine whether resources can be<br>
assigned to the logical channel in which traffic<br>
occurs.<br>
The transmission timing monitoring unit<br>
108 performs monitoring to determine whether the<br>
broadcast control channel or the paging control<br>
channel can be assigned at timings when each logical<br>
channel can be assigned.<br>
The logical channel type determination<br>
unit 110 determines a logical channel type of the<br>
logical channel monitored by the traffic monitoring<br>
unit 104.<br>
When it becomes possible to assign<br>
required resources to a logical channel according to<br>
the results of the traffic monitoring unit 104, the<br>
logical channel type determination unit 110, the<br>
transmission timing monitoring unit 118 and the<br>
resource monitoring unit 106, the logical channel<br>
assignment unit 112 assigns resources for the<br>
logical channel on the radio physical channel.<br>
The logical channel transmission unit 114<br>
transmits the assigned logical channel to the<br>
receiving apparatus 300.<br>
Next, channel assignment processes in the<br>
transmission apparatus 100 of the present embodiment<br>
is described with reference to Fig.6.<br>
The transmission timing monitoring unit<br>
108 of the transmission apparatus 100 checks whether<br>
now is a transmission available timing (step S602).<br>
When it is the transmission available<br><br>
-14-<br>
timing (step S602 : YES) , the traffic monitoring<br>
unit 104 determines whether there is a logical<br>
channel in which traffic occurs among logical<br>
channels (step S604) . When it is not the<br>
transmission available timing (step S602 : NO), the<br>
process ends.<br>
When there is a logical channel in which<br>
traffic occurs (step S604 : YES), the logical<br>
channel type determination unit 110 determines<br>
whether the logical channel is at least one of the<br>
broadcast control channel and the paging control<br>
channel (step S606). When there is no logical<br>
channel in which traffic occurs (step S604 : NO),<br>
the process ends.<br>
When the logical channel in which traffic<br>
occurs is at least one of the broadcast control<br>
channel and the paging control channel (step S606 :<br>
YES), the transmission timing monitoring unit 108<br>
determines whether the broadcast control channel or<br>
the paging control channel can be transmitted at the<br>
transmission timing (step S608).<br>
When it can be transmitted at the<br>
transmission timing (step S608 : YES), the logical<br>
channel assignment unit 112 assigns required radio<br>
resources on the radio physical channel to the<br>
logical channel (step S610) .<br>
On the other hand, as a result of the<br>
determination in step S606, when the logical channel<br>
is neither the broadcast control channel nor the<br>
paging control channel (step S606 : NO), the logical<br>
channel assignment unit 112 immediately assigns<br>
required resources on the radio physical channel to<br>
the logical channel (step S610).<br>
In addition, as a result of the<br>
determination in step S608, when it cannot be<br>
transmitted at the timing (step S608 : NO), the<br>
transmission timing monitoring unit 108 once stores<br><br>
-15-<br>
information until next transmission available timing,<br>
that is, the process returns to step S608, and the<br>
logical channel assignment unit 112 assigns radio<br>
resources on the radio physical channel to the<br>
logical channel immediately when the time becomes<br>
the transmission available timing.<br>
Next, a communication system of a second<br>
embodiment of the present invention is described.<br>
Since the configuration of the<br>
communication system according to the present<br>
embodiment is similar to the communication system of<br>
the first embodiment, it is not described.<br>
Next, the transmission apparatus 100 of<br>
the present embodiment is described.<br>
The configuration of the transmission<br>
apparatus of the present embodiment is similar to<br>
the configuration of the transmission apparatus of<br>
the first embodiment described with reference to<br>
Fig.5. However, the transmission timing monitoring<br>
unit 108 performs monitoring of a logical channel<br>
used for user common data information such as a MBMS<br>
channel, for example, in addition to monitoring of<br>
the broadcast control channel and the paging control<br>
channel.<br>
Next, correspondences between function<br>
channels and a physical channel and a configuration<br>
of the physical channel that are assumed in the<br>
present embodiment are described.<br>
The correspondences between the function<br>
channels and the physical channel that are assumed<br>
in the present embodiment are similar to the<br>
correspondences between the function channels and<br>
the physical channel of the first embodiment<br>
described with reference to Fig.3. However, the<br>
physical channel configuration is different from<br>
that of the first embodiment in that, when<br>
performing MBMS communications, positions to which<br><br>
-16-<br>
required resources can be assigned on the radio<br>
physical channel for MCCH, MSCH and MTCH (logical<br>
channels for multicast/broadcast) are limited. That<br>
is, user common data information such as a logical<br>
channel used for MBMS, for example, is assigned to a<br>
particular position on the radio physical channel.<br>
Since the user common data information that is<br>
multicast broadcast information, for example, can be<br>
transmitted from adjacent transmission apparatuses<br>
simultaneously, it can be transmitted only at a<br>
transmission timing determined among the adjacent<br>
transmission apparatuses.<br>
Next, channel assignment processes in the<br>
transmission apparatus 100 of the present embodiment<br>
are described with reference to Fig.7.<br>
The transmission timing monitoring unit<br>
108 of the transmission apparatus 100 checks whether<br>
now is a transmission available timing (step S702).<br>
When it is the transmission available<br>
timing (step S702 : YES), the traffic monitoring<br>
unit 104 determines whether there is a logical<br>
channel in which traffic occurs among logical<br>
channels (step S704). When it is not the<br>
transmission available timing (step S702 : NO), the<br>
process ends.<br>
When there is the logical channel in which<br>
traffic occurs (step S704 : YES), the logical<br>
channel type determination unit 110 determines<br>
whether the logical channel is user common data<br>
information that is a logical channel for MBMS, for<br>
example (step S706). When there is no logical<br>
channel in which traffic occurs (step S704 : NO),<br>
the process ends.<br>
When the logical channel is the logical<br>
channel for MBMS (step S706 : YES), the transmission<br>
timing monitoring unit 108 determines whether the<br>
logical channel for MBMS can be transmitted at the<br><br>
-17-<br>
transmission timing (step S708).<br>
When it can be transmitted at the<br>
transmission timing (step S708 : YES), the logical<br>
channel assignment unit 112 assigns required radio<br>
resources on the radio physical channel to the<br>
logical channel (step S710).<br>
On the other hand, as a result of the<br>
determination in step S706, when the logical channel<br>
is not the logical channel for MBMS (step S706 : NO),<br>
the logical channel assignment unit 112 immediately<br>
assigns required resources on the radio physical<br>
channel to the logical channel (step S710).<br>
In addition, as a result of the<br>
determination in step S708, when it cannot be<br>
transmitted at the timing (step S708 : NO), the<br>
transmission timing monitoring unit 108 once stores<br>
the multicast broadcast information until next<br>
transmission available timing, that is, the process<br>
returns to step S708, and the logical channel<br>
assignment unit 112 assigns radio resources for MBMS<br>
on the radio physical channel immediately to the<br>
logical channel when the time becomes the<br>
transmission available timing.<br>
Next, a communication system of a third<br>
embodiment of the present invention is described.<br>
Since the configuration of the<br>
communication system according to the present<br>
embodiment is similar to the communication system of<br>
the first embodiment described with reference to<br>
Fig.2, it is not described.<br>
Next, the transmission apparatus 100 of<br>
the present embodiment is described.<br>
The configuration of the transmission<br>
apparatus of the present embodiment is similar to<br>
the configuration of the transmission apparatus of<br>
the first embodiment described with reference to<br>
Fig.5. However, the transmission timing monitoring<br><br>
-18-<br>
unit 108 performs monitoring of a logical channel<br>
used for user common data information that is<br>
monitoring of a MBMS channel, for example, in<br>
addition to monitoring of the broadcast control<br>
channel and the paging control channel.<br>
Next, correspondences between function<br>
channels and a physical channel, and a configuration<br>
of the physical channel that are assumed in the<br>
present embodiment are described.<br>
The correspondences between the function<br>
channels and the physical channel of the present<br>
embodiment are similar to the correspondences<br>
between the function channels and the physical<br>
channel of the first embodiment described with<br>
reference to Fig.3. However, in each transmission<br>
timing, required radio resources are assigned to a<br>
logical channel in which traffic occurs, and when<br>
there are available radio resources remained, if the<br>
remained radio resources are adequate for required<br>
radio resources for another logical channel, the<br>
required radio resources are assigned to the logical<br>
channel. That is, the physical channel<br>
configuration is different from that of the first<br>
embodiment in that, the number of the logical<br>
channels that can be assigned required radio<br>
resources at a transmission timing is not limited to<br>
one, and a plurality of logical channels can be<br>
transmitted as long as radio resources remain.<br>
As to positions to which required radio<br>
resources can be assigned for the broadcast control<br>
channel and the paging control channel, when<br>
required radio resources are already assigned to the<br>
broadcast control channel and the paging control<br>
channel, radio resources are not assigned to other<br>
logical channels even though there are available<br>
radio resources remained. This is similar to the<br>
logical channel for MBMS. However, when code<br><br>
-19-<br>
division or frequency division are performed,<br>
required radio resources can be assigned to the<br>
other logical channel on the radio physical channel<br>
defined by different code/frequency at a same timing.<br>
Next, channel assignment processes in the<br>
transmission apparatus 100 of the present embodiment<br>
are described with reference to Fig.8.<br>
The transmission timing monitoring unit<br>
108 of the transmission apparatus 100 checks whether<br>
now is a transmission available timing (step S802) .<br>
When it is the transmission available<br>
timing (step S802 : YES), the traffic monitoring<br>
unit 104 determines whether there is a logical<br>
channel in which traffic occurs among logical<br>
channels (step S804). When it is not the<br>
transmission available timing (step S802 : NO), the<br>
process ends.<br>
When there is the logical channel in which<br>
traffic occurs (step S804 : YES), the logical<br>
channel type determination unit 110 determines<br>
whether the logical channel is at least one of the<br>
broadcast control channel, the paging control<br>
channel, and user common data information that is a<br>
logical channel for MBMS, for example (step S806) .<br>
When there is no logical channel in which traffic<br>
occurs (step S804 : NO), the process ends.<br>
When the logical channel is at least one<br>
of the broadcast control channel, the paging control<br>
channel, and the logical channel for MBMS (step<br>
S806 : YES), the transmission timing monitoring unit<br>
108 determines whether any one of the broadcast<br>
control channel, the paging control channel, and the<br>
logical channel for MBMS can be transmitted at the<br>
transmission timing (step S808).<br>
When it can be transmitted at the<br>
transmission timing (step S808 : YES), the logical<br>
channel assignment unit 112 assigns required radio<br><br>
-20-<br>
resources on the radio physical channel to the<br>
logical channel (step S810) .<br>
Next, the traffic monitoring unit 104<br>
checks whether there is another logical channel in<br>
which traffic occurs (step S812) .<br>
When there is the another logical channel<br>
in which traffic occurs (step S812 : YES), the<br>
resource assignment unit 106 checks whether the<br>
radio physical channel is code-divided or frequency-<br>
divided or the like in the radio system (step 814).<br>
When code division or frequency division<br>
is performed (step S814 : YES), the logical channel<br>
assignment unit 112 assigns required radio resources<br>
to the logical channel (step S810). However, when<br>
the logical channel in which the traffic occurs is<br>
the broadcast control channel, the paging control<br>
channel, or the logical channel for MBMS, the above-<br>
mentioned step is performed, that is, processes<br>
similar to step S808 are performed.<br>
When the logical channel is not any one of<br>
the broadcast control channel, the paging control<br>
channel and the logical channel for MBMS according<br>
to the result of the determination in step S806<br>
(step S806 : NO), the logical channel assignment<br>
unit 112 immediately assigns required radio<br>
resources on the radio physical channel to the<br>
logical channel (step S816).<br>
Next, the traffic monitoring unit 104<br>
checks whether there is another logical channel in<br>
which traffic occurs (step S818).<br>
When there is the logical channel in which<br>
traffic occurs (step S818 : YES), the resource<br>
monitoring unit 106 determines whether there are<br>
enough required resources requested by the logical<br>
channel (step S820).<br>
When the resources requested by the<br>
logical channel can be kept (step S820 : YES), the<br><br>
-21-<br>
logical channel assignment unit 112 immediately<br>
assigns the required resources to the logical<br>
channel (step S816). But, when the logical channel<br>
in which traffic occurs is any one of the broadcast<br>
control channel, the paging control channel and the<br>
channel for MBMS, processes similar to the above-<br>
mentioned step that is step S808 are performed.<br>
In addition, according to the result of<br>
the determination in step S808, when it cannot be<br>
transmitted at the timing (step S808 : NO), the<br>
logical channel assignment unit 112 once stores<br>
information of the broadcast control channel, the<br>
paging control channel or the channel for MBMS until<br>
next transmission available timing, that is, the<br>
process returns to step S808, and the logical<br>
channel assignment unit 112 assigns radio resources<br>
for the broadcast information, the paging<br>
information or MBMS on the radio physical channel<br>
immediately when transmission can be available.<br>
In addition, according to the results of<br>
determination in steps S812 and S818, when there is<br>
no other logical channel in which traffic occurs<br>
(step S812, step S818 : NO), the process ends.<br>
According to the result of determination<br>
in step S814, when there is nothing by which<br>
resources can be kept (step S804 : NO), the<br>
resources are not kept for the logical channel, and<br>
the process ends. Occurring traffic is assigned in<br>
a next transmission timing.<br>
In addition, according to the result of<br>
determination in step S820, when required resources<br>
requested by the logical channel cannot be kept<br>
(step S820 : NO), required resources are not<br>
assigned to the logical channel, and the process<br>
ends. Required resources are assigned at a next<br>
transmission timing to the logical channel to which<br>
resources was not assigned.<br><br>
-22-<br>
As mentioned above, according to the<br>
present embodiment, by transmitting a plurality of<br>
function channels (logical channels) using one<br>
physical channel, an effect that signaling (channel<br>
transition procedures, messages) can be reduced can<br>
be expected.<br>
In addition, an effect of decreasing<br>
protocol states and an effect of decreasing test<br>
processes can be obtained, and transition delay and<br>
data loss due to channel transition can be avoided.<br>
In addition, an effect for simplifying<br>
correspondences among channels can be expected.<br>
In addition, since resource assignment is<br>
performed successively on the radio channel<br>
according to traffic occurrence, waste of resources<br>
(code, time, frequency and the like) does not occur<br>
so that an effect that the resources can be used<br>
effectively can be expected. An effect can be<br>
expected in which it becomes unnecessary to define<br>
locations of function channels on the radio channel<br>
beforehand.<br>
[Industrial Applicability]<br>
The channel assignment apparatus and the<br>
channel assignment method of the present invention<br>
can be applied to a mobile communication system.<br>
