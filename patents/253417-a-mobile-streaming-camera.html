CAMERA FOR COMMUNICATION OF STREAMING MEDIA TO A REMOTE CLIENT<br>
This invention relates to a device for use with streaming media and is used in conjunction with compatible remote client devices to create a mobile conferencing system.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The Internet and several new technologies are combining to allow anywhere/anytime communications. High data rate wireless lechnologies such as IEEE 802.11 allow people to remain in touch electronically from virtually anywhere in the world. With the current state-of-the-art it is possible for an individual to communicate with another individual or group, by exchangBig electronic mail, using instant messaging services, or carrying on a conversation with Internet enabled telephones. With sufficient bandwidth, it is possible to send video over then Internet.<br>
Existing video conferencing systems are beginning to exploit the ubiquitous connectivity of the Internet instead of relying exclusively on ISDN or other forms of dedicated communications links. Conventional videoconferencing systems have been designed in a way whereby the subject material must be brought to the conference - for example into a meeting room that has been equipped with a system, or to a PC that has been equipped to function as a videoconferencing system. In most cases, the subject material is an fridividual or group who wish to communicate in real-time with another individual or group. Some video conferencing systems also include the capabiity to send images of small devices that can be placed near the videoconferencing equipment These systems cannot be used in many settings such as a factory floor, test lab or an inspection station where small size and complete mobffrty is required. Nevertheless, there is value in being able to participate in a video conference from these locations.<br>
Another alternative for these types of locations is a wearable computer system where an operator wears a head-mounted camera and microphone, which connect to a wearable computer that is able to establish a<br><br>
WO 2005/034505	PCT'CA20©4/001785<br>
2<br>
communications session with a remote person. These systems are currently restricted in their functionality, and are cumbersome to use in most circumstances. Most workers will find that the inconvenience of needing to wear computing equipment will diminish the value that these systems offer. As such they are most suitable for specialized and somewhat rare circumstances.<br>
What is needed is a streaming media apparatus that is truly portable with no wires of any sort that can be used as easily and quickly as telephone with the key difference being the addition of high quality. reai-Srne video communications. Furthermore, the portable apparatus needs to incorporate the major functions of a traditional video conferencing system in a smafl package not unlike a traditional camera, that can be used from virtually any location whether this location is outdoors, or in an industrial environment such as a factory floor. This will allow the conference to be brought to the subject material, which will dramatically improve the usefulness of video-based communications.<br>
Enterprises that engage in the development, manufacture and maintenance of expensive and complex products can take advantage of such a system to reduce the time to market and lower the costs of developing new products. Numerous issues arise during the product development process that slow down or completely halt the process. Missed delivery dates and cost overruns are typical outcomes. These outcomes are severe, given the ftne-to-market demands and multi million dollar costs associated with the development and introduction of many new products. A mobile collaboration sysfem that can “go to where the problem is” and provide real time video, audio and other collaboration tools to remote experts on their PCs where ever they are, has the potential to significantly reduce the time and cost required to resolve problems.<br>
As an example, consider the scenario where a mufti-million dollar machine has broken down. Lost revenues of hundreds of dollars an hour could result from the machine breakdown. On-site technical support is unable to fix the problem and the milling machine owner must call in a technical expert from the machines manufacturer to affect the repair. Technician availability, travel time and travel costs only amplify the problem. With a mobile video collaboration system, the on-site technician could take the digital camera out to the milling<br><br>

machine, connect to the manufacturer's technical expert back at their head office via the internet and have the expert guide him through the repair.<br>
This scenario illustrates just one way this product can be used. Many other uses are possible.<br>

OPERATION<br>
The MVCS provides a means for a MSC user (Operator) and a RC user (Client) to communicate and collaborate remotely. Subject video and audio captured by the MSC is digitally processed and transmitted in real time (streamed) to a RC 110 where it is rendered by the RC 110 for viewing and listening (respectively) by the Client. Voice communications between the Operator and the Client are facilitated by a full duplex, Voice-Over-Internet-Protocol (VoIP) communications channel established between the MSC and RC. A Registration Server function 104 and a Directory Server function 108 are used to authenticate and manage system access from the Operator/MSC and Client/RC. Video, Audio and Voice are streamed and control information is transferred, between the MSC, RC and servers, using Internet Protocol (IP) via an interconnecting:<br>
•	Local Area Network (LAN);<br>
•	Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN);<br>
•	Wireless Wide Area Network (WWAN);<br>
•	the Internet: or;<br>
•	any combination thereof.<br>
For the purposes of this document this interconnecting network is called the Network.<br>
The MVCS uses a variety of standard network communication protocols to implement control and streaming functionality. The following list itemizes the major protocols used within one implementation of the MVCS:<br>
•	Session initiation, control and termination is done using the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and the Session Description Protocol (SDP);<br>
•	VoIP streams may be either unicast or multicast and are encapsulated in Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) packets;<br>
•	Audio/video streams may be either unicast or multicast and are encapsulated in RTP packets;<br>
•	Real-time Transport Control Protocol (RTCP) is used to monitor<br><br>
WO 2005/034505	PCT/CA2004/001785<br>
16 <br>
real-time stream  delivery to  permit adjustments to maintain optimum quality;<br>
• Application and data sharing (remote control, image sharing, etc.) utilizes the T. 120 standard protocols.<br>
These protocols will be used throughout the remainder of this patent for the purpose of clearly describing the operation of the MVCS. However, other protocols can be used.<br>
The Operator'MSC 10C and Client/RC 110 log into the system using a secure connection to the Registration Server 104 via the Network 102/112/114/116. The MSC 100 and/or RC 110 pass user name and password information to the Registration Server 104 to verify their identity. The SIP Registration Server 104 in turn uses a LDAP or equivalent Directory Server 108 to validate the user name and password information passed to it If valid, access is granted and, IP address/port information and presence information from the Operator/MSC and/or Client/RC are updated in the Directory Server's 108 databases.<br>
To initiate a connection (call) with a RC/Client the Operator, using display and control capabilities provided by the MSC, enters the RC/Client's IP address/port information into the MSC. The MSC uses SIP (RFC3261) to then establish a connection with that IP Address/port and to negotiate characteristics of the communication using the Session Description Protocol (RFC2327) or similar. Alternatively, the Operator can select a RC/Clients name from a list stored in the MSC that associates names to IP address/port Alternatively, the Operator can access a list of RC/Clients names and associated IP address/port information from the Directory Server 108 via the Network. The RC can respond to the incoming connection request in ways such as but not limited to: automatically ignore, automatically answer, prompt the Client to manually answer/ignore. In the event that the RC/Client is already engaged in a connection with another MSC the RC will respond to this new connection request as busy. Audible and visual notifications are provided by the RC to the Client and by the MSC to the Operator that the MSC is attempting to connect. In the event that the MSC is not able to make a connection with the RC, a capability is provide to allow the Operator to<br><br>
WO 2005/034505	PCT/CA2004/001785<br>
17<br>
leave a message consisting of a VoIP voice clip and/or a subject audio and video clip on the RC.<br>
To initiate a connection with an MSC/Operator the Client, using display and control capabilities provided by the RC, enters the MSC/Operator's IP address/port information into the RC. The RC uses SIP (RFC3261) to then establish a connection with that IP Address/port and to negotiate characteristics of the communication using the Session Description Protocol (RFC2327) or similar. Alternatively, the Client can select a MSC/Operator's name from a list stored in the RC that associates names is I? address/port Alternatively, the Client can access a list of MSC/Operator's names and associated IP address/port information from the Directory Server 108 via the Network. The MSC can respond to the incoming connection request in ways such as but not limited to: automatically ignore, automatically answer, prompt the Operator to manually answer/ignore. In the event that the MSC/Operator is already engaged in a connection with another RC the MSC will respond to this new connection request as busy. Audible and visual notifications are provided by the RC to the Client and by the MSC to the Operator that the RC is attempting to connect. In the event that the RC is not able to make a connection with the MSC, a capability is provide to allow the Operator to leave a message consisting of a VoIP voice dip and/or a subject audio and video clip on the MSC.<br>
The MSC video capability allows an Operator to stream video captured by the MSC 100 to the RC 110 via the Network while viewing the video locally on the LCD 254.<br>
With the MSC turned on, Video captured by the Camera Module 200 is continually fed to the Video A/D converter 202 in analog S-Video format 201. The Video A/D converter 2G2 converts the analog video into digital video pixel data. This digital video pixel data is then fed to the Display Controller 212 and the Video Compression Engine 2D5 over CCIR0601 or equivalent interfaces 203 &amp; 204 (respectively).<br>
The Video Compression Engine compresses the digital video pixel data, received from the Video A/D Converter 202, into a highly compressed format using  CODECS  such  as  MPEG 4,  Windows  Media,  Real   or  H.264.  The<br><br>
WO 2005/034505	PCT/CA2004/001785<br>
18<br>
compressed digital video pixel data is collected into packets, time stamped and then fed to the MSC Processing Subsystem 213 via a USB interface 217.<br>
The Media Stream Server, implemented in software within the MSC Processing Subsystem 213 receives the compressed digital video pixel data packets from the Video Compression Engine 205 and formats them as required by the real time transport protocols such as RFC3016 (MPEG4 A/V streams over RTP). When the Operator presses and releases the Stream Start/Stop Button 400 the MSC's Media Stream Server opens a real time transport session with the RC 110, negotiates mutually compatible CODECs for subject video and audio and sends the formatted video rackets to the RC 110 through that session via the Network.<br>
The Display Controller 212, under the control of the MSC Processing Subsystem 213, uses the digital video pixel data received directly from the A/D Converter 202 to provide the Operator with a Video Viewflnder capability. To accomplish this,the Display Controller 212 formats the received digital video pixel data by buffering, decimating, clipping, cropping and color converting it and then displays the video on the LCD 254 by generating the signals to drive it. Using the control functions provided by the MSC, the Operator can control the decimating, clipping and cropping operations to size the view finder image and to digitally zoom in on a portion of the video.<br>
The MSC video capabflrty is enhanced by providing a connector 206 and interface circuits to route S-Vtdeo 201 from the internal Camera Module 200 to an external monitor 207. This capability allows an external monitor, when connected through a standard S-video cable, to be used to view the MSC's video signal. This feature is used, for example, in situations where the LCD is not visible to the Operator or in situations where a physically larger image is desired.<br>
The MSC video capability is enhanced by providing a connector and interface circuits for accepting S-video from an external video camera when connected with a standard S-Video cable. When this capability is enabled the Video A/D Converter 202 and the Video Compression Engine 205 process video from the External Video-in interface 208 instead of from the internal Camera Module 200.<br><br>
WO 2005/034505	PCT/CA2004/001785<br>
19<br>
The MSC video capability is enhanced by a Video Monitor Mode that allows the compressed digital video pixel data packets to be displayed locally on the LCD 254 in parallel with being streamed to the RC 110. This allows the Operator to view the video as the Client sees it. Video Monitor mode is accomplished by the MSC Processing Subsystem 213 unpacking and decompressing data packets received from the Video Compression Engine 205 back into digital video pixel data and routing the pixel to the Display Controller 212 for display on the LCD 254.<br>
The MSC video capability is enhanced by allowing the operator to use the Touch Panel 253 and Stytus 264 to designate the location within the subject video image to be used by the Camera Module 200 for exposure control. This capability utilizes the camera's Spot Exposure mode along with the LCD 254, Touch Panel 253 and Stylus 264. With the LCD displaying either View Finder video, Video Monitor video, or both, the operator, touches the Stylus 264 to the Touch Panel 253 surface over top of the point within the displayed video image that is desired to be used for exposure control processing. The MSC Processing Subsystem 213 computes the screen touch location and forwards this data to the Block Camera 200 over the VISCA Interface 262. The Block Camera 200 then uses the designated area to optimize exposure parameters.<br>
The MSC video capability is enhanced by allowing the MSC 100 to receive subject video from the RC 110 or compatible device, and render it on the LCD 254. This video session initiated by the Client/RC 110 and is established using the same real time protocols as those used to allow the MSC 100 to stream video to the RC 110 and, uses the same compression CODECs, MPEG4, Real, Windows Media, H.264. RC1"0 compressed video packets received by the MSC Processing Subsystem 213 from the RC 110 via the Network are unpacked into compressed digital video pbce) data packets. The MSC Processing Subsystem 213 then decompresses the compressed digital video pixel data packets into digital video pixel data using the negotiated CODEC and forwards the data to the Display Controller 212 for formatting and display on the LCD 254.<br>
The MSC video capability allows the LCD 254 to display View Finder video, Video Monitor video, RC 110 video or combinations there of simultaneously<br><br>
WO 2005/034505	PCT/CA2004/001785<br>
20<br>
in separate windows.<br>
Subject illumination can be improved by using the MSC's Illumination System 261. The Illumination System 261 brightness level can be controlled by the Operator, by the Client via the remote control functions of the RC 110 and, automatically under MSC software control. Under software control, the MSC computes the ambient fighting condition using exposure parameters reported by the Camera Module 200 including but not limited to iris, shutter speed and gain, and adjusts the External Optical inflammation system's 261 light output to maintain minimum acceptable ambient fight conditions. This algorithm allows for on/off control with preset control of the on brightness level as well as for continuous and variable light output control. Similarly, using focal length information provided by the Camera Module 200, the MSC software will turn on the LEDs banks that best match the distance that the object is away from the camera.<br>
The MSC allows the Client, through the use of a mouse or other pointing device connected to the RC 110, to control a cursor displayed on the LCD 254. This capability allows the Client to point to items within the video being displayed on the LCD 254. This capability is further enhanced by allowing the Client to draw images on top of the video being displayed on the LCD 254. Conversely, this capability allows the Operator to use the Touch Panel 253 and Stylus 264 to remotely control a cursor on the RC's display and allows the Operator to draw images on top of the MSCs video being displayed on the RC 110.<br>
The MSC audio capability allows the MSC 100 to stream digital audio associated with captured video to a RC 110 via the Network. The MSC 100 maintains time synchronization between audio and video streams.<br>
Audio captured by the 3u8t-ln Directional Microphone 230 is fed in analog format to the Audio Codec Subsystem 214 where it is converted in real time into Pulse Code Modulation (PCM) digital audio data. This PCM digital audio data is transferred to the Video Compression Engine 205 via an I2S serial interface 216. The Video Compression Engine 205 collects the received PCM digital audio data into packets and time synchronizes them to the compressed digital video using time stamping and then forwards the synchronized PCM digital audio data packets<br><br>
WO 2005/034505	PCT/CA2004/001785<br>
21<br>
to the MSC Processing Subsystem 213 via a USB interface 217.<br>
The MSC Processing Subsystem 213, compresses the PCM digital audio data received from the Video Compression Engine 205 into MPEG layer 3 audio (MP3) or AAC or other video compatible audio compression format. The Media Stream Server, implemented in software within the MSC Processing Subsystem 213 then formats it as required by the real time transport session protocols such as RFC3C1S {MPEG4 A/V streams over RTP). When an Operator presses and releases the Stream Start/Stop Button 400 the MSC's Media Stream Server opens a real time transport session with the RC 110 via the Network and sends the formatted audio packets to the client through that session.<br>
The MSC audio capability is enhanced by providing a connector and interface circuits for accepting External Audio 263 from an external video camera, or other external microphone source, when connected with a standard RCA jack audio cable to the External Audio-ln interface 264. When enabled External Audio 263 is processed as subject audio instead of audio from the Built-in Directional Microphone 230.<br>
The MSC allows the Operator to listen to subject audio being captured by the MSC and streamed to the Client/RC. By listening to subject audio the Operator can monitor the quality of the audio being streamed to the Client/RC. This is called Audio Monitor. Audio Monitor Mode is implemented by the MSC Processing Subsystem 213 and causes audio for the Built-in Directional Microphone 230 or External Audio 263 source to be routed to a connected Headset 228/229. Audio Monitor Mode is controlled by the Operator using display and control funcficns provided by the MSC. Through these controls the Operator can chose to listen to; Client VoIP Audio only; subject audio only or; both mixed together.<br>
The MSC audio capability is enhanced by allowing the MSC 100 to receive subject audio from the RC 110 or compatible device, and output it to the speaker 253. This audio session is initiated by the Client/RC 110 and is established using the same real time protocols as those used to allow the MSC 100 to stream audio to the RC110 and, uses the same compression CODECS, (MP3, AAC).    Compressed audio packets received by the MSC Processing<br><br>
WO 2005/034505	PCT/CA2004/001785<br>
22<br>
Subsystem 213 from the RC 110 via the Network are unpacked and decompressed using the negotiated CODEC. The MSC Processing Subsystem 213 then streams it to the Audio Codec Subsystem 214 via I2S interface 215. The Audio CODEC Subsystem 214 converts the received PCM digital audio data into an analog signal, filters and amplifies it and routes it to the Built-in Speaker 233 and/or the speaker of a connected Headset 228.<br>
The MSC voice capability allows an Operator to initiate or receive a VoIP telephone call with a Client, at the same time as the MSC 100,is streaming video, audio and pictures to the RC 110 via the Network. The call is established using Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). The Operator uses a Headset 228 connected via the Audio Jack 227 or the MSC's speaks phone capability for VoIP telephone calls. The speaker phone capability utilizes the Built-in Omni-Directional Microphone 269 and Built-in Speaker 233 in conjunction with echo cancellation software running on the MSC Processing Subsystem 213 to provide hands-free, full duplex operation.<br>
Microphone audio from an external Headset 228, connected via the Audio Jack 227, is fed in analog format to the Audio Codec Subsystem 214 where it is converted in real time into Pulse Code Modulation (PCM) digital audio data. The PCM digital audio data is then transferred to the MSC Processor Subsystem 213 via I2S interface 215.<br>
Audio from the Built-in Omni-Directional Microphone 269 is fed in analog format to the Audio Codec Subsystem 214 where it is converted in real time into Pulse Code Modulation (PCM) digital audio data. The PCM digital audio data is then transferred to the MSC Processing Subsystem 213 via 12S interface 215.<br>
The MSC Processing Subsystem 213 receives Built-in Omni-Directional Microphone 230 and Headset Microphone 228 PCM digital audio data directly from the Audio Codec Subsystem 214 via an I2S interface 215. The MSC Processing Subsystem 213 performs echo cancellation operations on this data and then compresses it using CODECs such as G.711, G.723, G.729, GSM or other VoIP appropriate CODECs. This compressed voice data is then formatted into packets and streamed to a RC 110 via the Network.<br>
VoIP data packets received from the RC 110 via the Network are<br><br>
WO 2005/034505	PCT/CA2004/001785<br>
23<br>
unpacked and decompressed back into PCM digital audio data by the MSC Processing Subsystem 213 using the appropriate CODEC, such as G.711, G.723, G.729, GSM or other. The MSC Processing Subsystem 213 then streams it to the Audio Codec Subsystem 214 via I2S interface 215. The Audio CODEC Subsystem 214 converts the received PCM digital audio data into an analog signal, filters and amplifies it and routes it to the Built-in Speaker 233 and/or the speaker of a connected Headset 228.<br>
The MSC audio capabilities are enhanced by the MSC Processing Subsystem's 213 separate processing of subject audio and the Operator's voice audio. By processing and streaming these sources separately the Client can control the RC 110 to play subject audio only, Operator's VoIP audio only or the two audio sources mixed together.<br>
The audio and voice capabilities of the MSC 100 are enhanced by allowing the use of a Wireless Headset 229 instead of a wired head set 228. The MSC 100 provides a 900MHz ISM band digital radio 224, or other equivalent radio system, and an Antenna 225 to send/receive PCM digital audio data to/from a compatible Wireless Headset 229. When the wireless headset feature is enabled PCM digital audio data is routed from the Audio Codec Subsystem 214 to the 900MHz ISM band digital radio link 224/225 via a bi-directional !2S serial interface 223 where it is modulated and transmitted to an associated Wireless Headset 229. Likewise, PCM digital audio data demodulated by the 900MHz ISM band digital radio link 224/225 from the wireless headset 229 is routed to the Audio Codec Subsystem 214 over the I2S interface 223.<br>
The wireless headset capability is enhanced by providing multiple independent bi-directional radio channels to eliminate interference between co-located MVCS systems and their associated wireless headsets.<br>
Two realizations of the Wireless Headset 229 are provided. The first version embeds the digital radio and battery power source into the headset The second version utilizes a small, wearable, module (Dongle) to house the digital radio and battery power source. An external connector is provided on the Dongle to allow compatible wired headsets to be plugged in thus allowing for a broader selection of headset to be used while still maintaining a wireless connection<br><br>

between the Operator and the MSC 100.<br>
The video, audio and voice capabilities of the MSC 10O are enhanced by its ability to adapt to the available network bandwidth and reliability between it and the RC 110. This is accomplished by the RC 110 collecting and reporting session performance metrics, about the end-to-end network connection between it and the MSC 100, back to the MSC 100 using the Real time Transport Control Protocol (RTCP (RFC1889)) or similar protocol. Metrics reported include but are not limited to lost packet rate, packet latency and packet jitter. Using this reported data the MSC 100 then adjust the video, audio and voice data stream parameters according to a pre-defined algorithm to optimize the quality delivered to the RC 110 for the available connection.<br>
The video, audio and voice capabilities of the MSC 10O are enhanced by allowing compressed video, audio and voice streams to be stored in the MSC's local file storage system 265 and/or installed portable memory cards 258 and/or USB memory modules connected via the USB Host interface 259/260 and/or to a Network File System (NFS) storage facility 150. This capability operates independent of the MSC 100 streaming it to the RC 110. The files are automatically named and can be manually renamed if desired. The files are automatically tagged with information such as the date, time, encoding information and the identities of the Operator, Client and MSC that were involved in the session. The Operator can add file description text and voice clip annotation to each item stored.<br>
The MSC video capability is enhanced by allowing an operator to capture still images (pictures) from the video stream and to store them in the local file system 265 or on an installed portable memory card 258 and/or stream them to the RC 110. The files are automatically named and can be manually renamed if desired. The files are automatically tagged with information such as the date, time, encoding information and the identities of the Operator, Client and MSC that were involved in the session. The Operator can add file description text and voice clip annotation to each item stored. Pictures are captured by the Operator pressing and releasing the Freeze Frame 402 button. Associated with this action the MSC 100 will capture the next video frame provided by the camera, produce an audible<br><br>
WO 2005/034505	PCT/CA2004/001785<br>
25<br>
alert such as a camera shutter sound to indicate that an image has been captured, format the image into a JPEG, TIFF, BMP or other image format, and display the captured image to for the Operator on the LCD 254. The MSC 100 Will then provide the operator with options for saving, the images, transmitting the image to a Remote Client 110 or discarding the image.<br>
The video, audio and voice capabilities of the MSC 100 are enhanced by allowing video, audio, voice and pictures stored in the MSC's local file storage system 265 or in an installed portable memory card 258 or in a USB memory modules connected via the USB Host interface 259/260 or to a Network File System (NFS) storage facility 150 to be retrieved and played back on the MSC 100 and/or streamed to the RC 110. This content can be played, paused, rewound, searched, stopped and fast forwarded with Buttons 255 and 300 through 312 and Touch Panel 253/322 controls provided on the device. The MSC Processing Subsystem 213 acquires the data from the storage medium, decompresses formats and forwards it to the Display Controller 212 which in turn displays it on the LCD 254. Concurrently the MSC Processing Subsystem 213 can transfer the data from the storage medium to a RC 110. Retrieval of stored streams is facilitated through a file viewer application running on the MSC Processing Subsystem 213 and presenting a display on the LCD 254. The file viewer function displays file name, file properties and thumbnail images for each stored item on the LCD 254. The file viewer function provides the ability to play any associated voice annotations via the Built-in Speaker 233 or headsets 228 and 229.<br>
The video, audio and voice capabilities of the MSC 100 are enhanced by allowing video, audio, voice and pictures to be encrypted prior to streaming them to a RC 110. This capability is used in situations where secure transmission of video, audio and voice are required. In this mode, the MSC Processing Subsystem 213 encrypts transport packets prior to providing them to the media stream server function. The MSC Processing Subsystem 213 uses Data Encryption Standard (DES), Triple DESC (3DES) or Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) cryptographic algorithms for this purpose.<br>
A backlight is provided to improve view ability of the LCD in low light<br><br>
WO 2005/034505	PCT/CA2004/001785<br>
26<br>
conditions. The LCD's Backlight can be adjusted using MSC electronics and software. The MSC software allows the Operator to manually control the brightness level by selecting the desired level from a menu displayed on the LCD 254 or automatically by using exposure settings reported by the camera module, such as but not limited to iris, shutter speed and gain. Using these settings the MSC computes the ambient light levels and adjusts the backlight brightness to match those conditions.<br>
Remote control can be applied to the MSC 100 from a RC 110 by communicating commands to the MSC 100 over the Network or from a host computer over the USB Host interface. A RC can use this capability to set key compression parameters of the MSC 100 including: - audio and video codec selection, audio format, video size, frame rate, video bit rate, key frame interval, buffer size, video smoothness, decoder complexity, crop method, de-interlace processing, inverse telecine processing, pixel format, time code generation, and packet size. The RC can also use this capability to control live and stored content stream functions including: - Stream Start/Stop/Pause, Record Start/Stop, Rewind, Shuttle Back, Shuttle Forward, Fast Forward, Tele Zoom, Wide Zoom, Manual Focus On/Off, Focus In/Out, Still Capture.<br>
Connecting the MSC 100 to a keyboard via the USB Host interface 259/260 allow the camera operator to locally control all aspects of the MSC's operation and configuration. Connecting the MSC 100 to a USB memory module dient via USB Host 259/260 provides the ability to upload configuration data to the device, to stream content to the memory module for storage and to play back: previously stored content. The devices' USB Host interface 259/260 also provides the capability to connect to remote control devices such as a motorized Tripod 240 frtus giving the MSC 100 and RC 110 the capability to control the physical orientation of the device.<br>
The MSC 100 provides an interface 244 to an external Docking Station 241 allowing the MSC 100 to obtain DC power 242 and unique serial number information 243 from the Docking Station 241. DC power 245 is routed to the MSC's power supply and used to run the MSC 100 and charge the internal battery.  Unique serial number information from a Docking Station 241 is used to<br><br>
WO 2005/034505	PCT/CA2004/001785<br>
27<br>
assist with locating the device. This is accomplished using a docking station in a known, fixed location. A MSC 100 reporting a docking station serial number to a RC 110 implies that the MSC 100 is at the same location as the docking station. The Docking Station unique serial number information 243 is read by the MSC Processing Subsystem 213. The MSC Processing Subsystem 213 streams this information to a RC 110 via the Network.<br>
The MSC 100 provides a capability to measure the straight line distance between the MSC 100 and the subject utilizing focus information provided by the Camera Module 200. Using focal length and aperture data received from the Camera Module 200 the MSC Processing Subsystem (213) computes an estimate of the average distance to the subject and makes this data available on the LCD Display 254 and to the RC 210.<br>
The MSC 500 is enhanced by allowing multiple RCs 510 to interact with a single MSC 500 at the same time. RCs 510 can view the video and hear the audio streamed by the MSC 500, can remotely control the MSC 500 and can participate in a VoIP conference call session with the MSC 500.<br>
Video and Audio support for multiple RCs 510 is accomplished by the addition of a Video Distribution Server function 502. The Video Distribution Server 502 works in conjunction with a Registration Server 504 to establish SIP Video and Audio sessions between the MSC 500 and participating RCs 510. Once sessions have been established the MSC 500 streams best-quality video and audio streams to the Video Distribution Server 502 which in turn distributes the streams to each RC 510. Each RC 510 can control audio and video codec selection, audio format, video size, frame rate, video bit rate, key frame interval, buffer size, video smoothness, decoder complexity, crop method, de-interlace processing, inverse telecine processing, pixel format, time code generation, and packet size of the streams presented to it by the video Distribution Server 502. This is accomplished through software running on the Video Distribution Server which decodes the best-quality streams received from the MSC 100 and re-encodes them according to the characteristics set by each RC 510. The Video Distribution Server then streams the re-encoded video streams to the RCs 510 via the Network.<br>
A VoIP Conference Call capability is  provided in  multiple  RC<br><br>

28<br>
 situations through the use of a Voice Conferencing Server function 506.    The<br>
Conferencing Server 506 works in conjunction with a Registration Server 504 to<br>
establish a SIP voice session between the MSC 100 and RCs 510.   Once a<br>
session   has   been   established  each  participant  (MSC   100  and  RCs   510)<br>
compresses its microphone audio, using a previously negotiated VoIP CODEC,<br>
and streams it to the Voice Conferencing Server 506 via the Network. The Voice<br>
Conferencing Server receives these VoIP input streams via its network interface,<br>
decodes and normalizes each creating PCM digital voice audio streams. It creates<br>
unique, VoIP output data streams to stream back to each participant by summing<br>
together the PCM digital voice audio input streams from each participant other<br>
than the one that the stream is being sent to. One such stream is created for each<br>
participant   Each stream is then compressed using a previously negotiated VoIP<br>
CODEC and streamed back to the target participant as VoIP data streams via the<br>
Network.<br>
The Video Distribution and VoIP Conference Call capabilities are<br>
enhanced by their ability to adapt to the available network bandwidth between<br>
them and the RCs 510 and between them and the MSC 500.    Each RC 510<br>
collects   and   reports   performance   statistics   about  the   end-to-end  network<br>
connection between it and the Servers to the Servers. Similarly the Servers report<br>
back end-to-end network connection performance metrics between them and the<br>
MSC 500 back to the MSC 500. Metrics reported include but are not limited to lost<br>
packet rate, packet latency and packet jitter.    Using these reported data the<br>
Servers and the MSC 500 then adjust their stream data parameters for video,<br>
audio and voice according to a pre-defined algorithm to optimize the quality<br>
delivered to the RC and Servers (respectively), for the available connection<br><br>
