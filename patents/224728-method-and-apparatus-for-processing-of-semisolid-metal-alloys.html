				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>THIS INVENTION relates to the processing of metal alloys in a semi solid<br>
state known as Semi-Salid Metals technology (SSM). In particular, the invention relates<br>
to a method and apparatus for producing a semi-solid metal alloy,<br>
A known SSM processing route is that of thixo-casting. The thixo-casting<br>
processing route involves manufacturing billets having a desired microstructure (which<br>
is usually supplied to a forming facility by a producer or continuous caster) followed by<br>
re-heating to a semi-solid state and forming into the desired product. One of the known<br>
advantages of the thixo-casting process is that the forming facility is able to process the<br>
semi-liquid metal which readily lends itself to automation of the process. Some of the<br>
disadvantages of the thixo-casting process include the difficulty in obtaining fully<br>
homogenous billets in a continuous casting (electromagnetic stirred); metal losses<br>
during re-heating of the billet; and undesired oxidisation during the re-heating process<br>
on the surface of the biliet. In addition, gates and risers arising from the formed product<br>
cannot usually be re-cycled by the forming facility and must be sent back to the<br>
producer/continuous casier, which leads to additional costs.<br>
Thixo-Casting, in which the billets are moulded after they are heated to<br>
temperatures that produce semi-solid state metals, is different from another known<br>
processing route, namely, the rheo-casting processing route. In the rheo-casfing<br>
processing route, molten metal alloy containing globular or spherical primary crystals is<br>
produced continuously and moulded as such without being solidified into biliets. In this<br>
process the liquid alloy is cooled down to a temperature between the alloys liquidus and<br>
solidus temperature i.e. to provide an alloy in a semi-solid state. This is done in a<br>
controlled manner with agitation and, optionally, with the addition of grain refining<br>
agents. The slurry is, subsequently, formed into the desired product. The object of the<br>
controlled cooling process and agitation is to avoid or impede dendritic crystallization<br>
and, instead, to promote the formation of globular or spherical primary crystals<br>
suspended in a liquid eutectic. The desired microstructure is obtained by the<br>
combination of controlled cooling, stirring and, optionally, the addition of a grain refining<br>
agent.<br>
One of the advantages of the rheo-casting processing route is that the<br>
forming facility is able to re-cycle the scrap in-house and there are insignificant metal<br>
losses since there is no re-heating. One of the disadvantages with this processing route<br>
is that, being a controlled process which produces the desired microstructure in a single<br>
stage, the apparatus and processes of which the Applicant is aware require complex<br>
design and manufacturing facilities to ensure effective operative association with the<br>
final product forming stage.<br>
It is an object of this invention to provide a method and apparatus which find<br>
substantial utility in the rheo-casting processing route and which provide a less<br>
cumbersome and more streamlined or simplified processing route compared to<br>
apparatus and methods of which the Applicant is aware.<br>
According to one aspect of the invention, there is provided a method of<br>
producing a semi-solid metal alloy for use in forming a final product, which method<br>
includes<br>
providing a treatment zone which is defined by an AC induction coil and charge<br>
cooling means;<br>
introducing a charge of contained molten metal into the treatment zone by<br>
displacing said charge along a linear path from a starting position which is aligned with<br>
the treatment zone;<br>
simultaneously subjecting the charge to an electromagnetically induced force field<br>
and controlled cooling in said treatment zone, said force field being induced by<br>
supplying said induction coil with current in the range of 100 to 12000 amps and at a<br>
frequency of between 60 to 30000 Hz thereby to provide a force field intensity which is<br>
sufficient to induce turbulence and vibratory motion in the charge during cooling to<br>
promote primary globular crystal formation instead of dendritic crystal formation; and<br>
displacing said treated charge from the treatment zone by urging a subsequent<br>
charge into the treatment zone along said linear path.<br><br>
It is to be understood that, for a particular alloy, the intensity of the<br>
electromagnetic field and the rate of cooling are selected to impede dendritic<br>
crystallization and to promote the formation of globular or spherical primary crystals<br>
thereby to provide a semi-solid metal alloy of desired microstructure for subsequent<br>
shaping or forming. The electromagnetic field, in addition to inducing turbulence within<br>
the charge, induces a vibratory field in the charge which assists in impeding the<br>
formation of dendritic cystals.<br>
The charge may be displaced from the treatment zone into at least one<br>
further treatment zone which is arranged in series and aligned with said treatment zone.<br>
Preferably, the method includes continuously introducing a subsequent<br>
charge into the first of said treatment zones along the linear path thereby urging the<br>
previously introduced charge which occupies the treatment zone through the at least<br>
one further treatment zone. This is done in a step-wise or sequential fashion until the<br>
leading charge is ejected from the last of said treatment zones.<br>
Thus, a plurality of treatment zones may be arranged in series and aligned<br>
with the linear path thereby providing a train of treatment zones. In this embodiment,<br>
continuously introducing a fresh charge into the first treatment zone advances<br>
previously introduced charges in a step-wise fashion along the train.<br>
The train of treatment zones may be vertically aligned with the charges being<br>
advanced upwardly along the train by the introduction of the fresh charge into the train.<br>
Thus, the charges may be stacked in end-to-end fashion in the treatment zones.<br>
In other words, the method may include urging the charges into the first of<br>
said treatment zones in a vertical direction along the linear path to provide a stack of<br>
vertically aligned charges.<br>
The method may include supporting the charge in the first treatment zone<br>
and releasing said support when a fresh charge is introduced thereby to allow said<br>
charge to be urged from the treatment zone.<br>
In particular, the charges may be introduced upwardly into the first treatment<br>
zone, and the method may further including supporting the charge which occupies the<br>
first treatment zone in a fixed position and releasing said support simultaneously with<br>
the introduction of a fresh charge into the first treatment zone. This allows said fresh<br>
charge initially to support the charge in the first treatment zone (for example, by resting<br>
on its upper end) and subsequently to displace the charge from the treatment zone on<br>
being advanced.<br>
The method may include sensing the temperature of the charge in the first<br>
and/or further treatment zones.<br>
The electromagentic field may be induced by an AC induction coil.<br>
The cooling in any one of the treatment zones may be provided by a gaseous<br>
coolant being discharged in at least one cooling flow stream onto or towards the charge.<br>
According to another aspect of the invention, there is provided an apparatus<br>
for producing a semi-solid metal alloy from a molten charge of said alloy, the apparatus<br>
including<br>
a treatment zone into which a charging container is receivable;<br>
charge cooling means for cooling the charge when the container is positioned in<br>
the treatment zone;<br>
electromagnetic force field inducing means for inducing an electromagnetic force<br>
field in the charge when positioned in the treatment zone, said electromagnetic field<br>
inducing means being in the form of an AC induction coil to which a current of 100 to<br>
12000 amps is supplied at a frequency of 60 to 30000 Hz, in use, thereby to induce a<br>
force field of sufficient intensity to promote primary globular crystal formation instead of<br>
dendritic crystal formation during cooling; and<br>
a charging arrangement having supporting means for supporting the charging<br>
container in a starting position which is in alignment with the treatment zone and<br>
displacement means for displacing the charging container from the starting position<br>
along a linear path into the treatment zone, said treatment zone being configured to<br>
allow the charging container to be displaced from the treatment zone after treatment by<br><br>
the urging of a subsequent charging container into the treatment zone along said linear<br>
path.<br>
The charge cooling means and electromagnetic field inducing means may be<br>
arranged to provide a longitudinally extending open-ended passage which defines the<br>
treatment zone and into which the charging containers are received. Preferably, the<br>
passage may extend vertically.<br>
The apparatus may include a supporting arrangement for supporting the<br>
charging container in the treatment zone, said supporting arrangement being configured<br>
to, simultaneously with the introduction of a subsequent charging container, release<br>
said charging container to allow the charging container to be supported by the<br>
subsequent charging container and to permit displacement of said charging container<br>
from the treatment zone on advancement of the subsequent charging container into the<br>
treatment zone.<br>
The supporting arrangement may include a retaining element which is<br>
mounted for displacement between a retracted position, in which the element is clear of<br>
the treatment zone, and an extended position, in which it extends into the treatment<br>
zone and supports the charging container positioned in the treatment zone.<br>
The retaining element may be provided with an engagement formation which<br>
engages with a complementary engagement formation when the retaining element is in<br>
the extended position.<br>
The apparatus may include at least one further treatment zone having<br>
electromagnetic field inducing means and charge cooling means which are arranged to<br>
provide a further longitudinally extending passage which is adjacent to and aligned with<br>
the passage of the treatment zone.<br>
Thus, the treatment zones may provide a train of a plurality of treatment<br>
zones. Preferably, the apparatus may include two further treatment zones, in addition<br>
to the first treatment zone. The treatment zones in the train may be vertically aligned.<br>
The support means may include a charge support on which the charging<br>
container is supported, in use, and releasable gripping means for releasably gripping<br>
the support. In this embodiment the complementary engagement formation may be<br>
provided by the charge support.<br>
The apparatus may include temperature sensing means for sensing the<br>
temperature of the charge in the treatment zone(s).<br>
The charge cooling means may include a plurality of independently operable<br>
tube sections which follow a helical path and which are positioned between adjacent<br>
turns of the induction coil.<br>
The tube sections may be secured to the adjacent turns of the induction coil,<br>
for example, by brazing.<br>

Referring to Figure 1 of the drawings, reference numeral 10 generally<br>
represents an apparatus, in accordance with the invention, for producing a semi-solid<br>
metal alloy from a molten charge of the alloy.<br>
The apparatus 10 includes a treatment zone, generally indicated by<br>
reference numeral 12 into which a charging container 14 is receivable. The apparatus<br>
10 further includes charge cooling means, generally indicated by reference numeral 16,<br>
for cooling a charge when the charging container 14 is positioned in the treatment zone<br>
12, as is described in more detail below. The apparatus 10 also includes<br>
electromagnetic field inducing means, generally indicated by reference numeral 18, for<br>
inducing an electromagnetic field in the charge when the charging container 14 is<br>
positioned in the treatment zone 12, as is described in more detail below.<br>
The apparatus 10 includes a charging arrangement, generally indicated by<br>
reference numeral 20. The charging arrangement 20 has supporting means 22 for<br>
supporting the charging container 14 in a starting position (shown in Figure 1 of the<br>
drawings) which is in alignment with the treatment zone 12 and displacement means,<br>
generally indicated by reference numeral 24, for displacing the container 14 from the<br>
starting position along a linear path, indicated by the dotted line labelled with reference<br>
numeral 26, into the treatment zone 12, as is described in more detail below.<br>
The treatment zone 12 is configured to allow the charging container 14 to be<br>
displaced from the first treatment zone 12 by urging of a subsequent charging container<br>
14 along the linear path 26 into the treatment zone 12, as is also described in more<br>
detail below.<br><br>
The apparatus 10 includes a base member 28 onto which an upwardly<br>
extending frame or support assembly 30 is mounted. The charging arrangement 20 is<br>
mounted on the base 28 adjacent to the support assembly 30.<br>
Referring also to Figure 4 of the drawings, the charging arrangement 20<br>
includes a linear drive unit, generally indicated by reference numeral 31. Only part of<br>
the drive unit 31 is shown in Figure 4 of the drawings. The drive unit 31 includes a<br>
vertically extending rail assembly 32 which is provided with two vertically extending side<br>
faces 32.1, 32.2 and a front face 32.3. A vertically extending rail element 34 is mounted<br>
on the front face 32.3 and extends parallel to the side faces 32.1 and 32.2.<br>
The drive unit 31 further includes a pneumatically operated main cylinder 40<br>
which extends from and is mounted to an upper free end of the side member 32.1. A<br>
piston rod 42 extends from the cylinder 40 in a vertical direction, parallel to the rail<br>
element 34. A carriage assembly, indicated generally by reference numeral 44, is<br>
mounted to a lower end of the piston rod 42. The carriage assembly 44 includes a<br>
second pneumatically operated cylinder 46. A horizontally extending mounting plate 50<br>
protrudes from a side of the cylinder 46.<br>
The supporting means 22 includes an arm 48 which extends parallel to the<br>
base 28. An upper surface 48.1 of the arm 48, remote from its free end, is upwardly<br>
turned to provide a vertically extending support or mounting element 52. An<br>
engagement formation 53 is mounted on the element 52 by means of securing elements<br>
54 and 52.1 thereby connecting the cylinder 46 to the arm 48. As will be appreciated,<br>
the engagement formation 53 defines a channel (not shown) which receives the rail<br>
element 34 and is slidably displaceable relative thereto.<br>
The linear drive unit 31 is in an extended position in Figures 1 and 4 of the<br>
drawings. Actuation of the cylinder 46 displaces the piston rod 42 along a short stroke<br>
in a direction, generally indicated by reference numeral 56 in Figure 4 of the drawings,<br>
and actuation of the cylinder 40 causes displacement of the rod 42 and cylinder 46<br>
along a long stroke in the same direction. This displacement causes the carriage<br>
assembly 44 to be displaced upwardly which in turn displaces the arm 48 along the rail<br>
element 34 thereby moving the arm 48 in a direction indicated by reference numeral 58.<br><br>
in a direction opposite to that indicated by reference numeral 58. An adjustable stop 55<br>
is provided which is used to set the extent to which the rod 42 protrudes from an upper<br>
end of the cylinder and, hence, controls the stroke length.<br>
The short stroke cycle is used to advance the container 14 along the linear<br>
path 26 into a position in which a leading end of the container 14 is positioned in an<br>
entrance to the treatment zone 12, as is described below. The long stroke cycle is used<br>
to advance the container 14 from this position along the successive treatment zones 12,<br>
12.1 and 12.2, as is described below.<br>
A free end of the supporting means 22 is provided with a circular cylindrical<br>
base element 62 which defines an upper circular supporting surface 65 for supporting a<br>
charge support 200, which is described in more detail below, with reference to Figures<br>
1, 5 and 6 of the drawings.<br>
The free end of the arm 48 further includes releasable gripping means,<br>
generally indicated by reference numeral 60 for releasably gripping the support 200<br>
when supported on the base element 62. The gripping means 60 is in the form of three<br>
gripping elements 63 which are circumferentially spaced around an upper edge of the<br>
base element 62 and which extend upwardly from the surface 65. The elements 63 are<br>
mounted for limited radial movement in a direction indicated by the arrow labelled with<br>
reference numeral 64 to releasably grip an outer wall of the support 200, as is described<br>
in more detail below.<br>
Referring also to Figures 2 and 3 of the drawings, reference numeral 70<br>
generally indicates a supporting arrangement for supporting the charging container 14<br>
in the treatment zone 12, as is described in more detail below. For ease of reference,<br>
the supporting arrangement is described in detail with reference to Figures 2, 3 and 3A<br>
of the drawings. Certain reference numerals have been excluded from Figure 1 of the<br>
drawings, for the sake of clarity.<br>
The supporting arrangement 70 includes a bracket assembly 72 having a<br>
generally rectangular bracket element 76 which is provided with a plurality of<br>
longitudinally spaced apertures 78 and a generally triangular-shaped bracket element<br><br>
longitudinally spaced apertures (not shown) which are in register with the apertures 78<br>
when the bracket assembly 72 is assembled. The bracket assembly 72 includes an<br>
upper supporting surface 80 which supports a tray assembly, generally indicated by<br>
reference numeral 82, as is described in more detail below. As can be seen<br>
schematically in Figure 1 of the drawings, the bracket assembly 72 is positioned against<br>
an inner side 81 of the support assembly 30, for example, by means of securing<br>
elements which extend through the apertures 78 and into the corresponding apertures<br>
(not shown) provided on the leading face 78.1 thereby to position the supporting<br>
arrangement 70, as is shown in Figure 1 of the drawings.<br>
The tray assembly 82 includes a lower tray element 84 which is generally<br>
rectangular in shape. The tray element 84 defines a longitudinally extending recess 86<br>
which opens out of a side of the element 84. A slot 88 extends from an opposed side of<br>
the element 84 along the remaining part of the length of the element 84 and opens into<br>
the recess 86, as can best be seen in Figure 3 of the drawings. A pair of apertures 110<br>
is provided adjacent the opening of the slot 88. A generally circular aperture 92 extends<br>
through the recessed part of the element 84. Circumferentially spaced slots 92.1 are<br>
provided. Opposed inner side walls 88.1 of the element 84 are generally arcuate in<br>
shape in the region of the aperture 92, as is indicated by reference numeral 90, so that<br>
the aperture 92 is generally circular when seen in plan. A series of longitudinally<br>
spaced apertures 112 are positioned adjacent the side walls 88.1.<br>
The arrangement 70 further includes a releasable supporting mechanism<br>
generally indicated by reference numeral 94. The supporting mechanism 94 includes a<br>
pneumatically operated cylinder 96 and a piston rod 98 which extends horizontally from<br>
the cylinder 96. A free end of the piston rod 98 is of reduced or threaded cross-<br>
sectional area, as indicated by reference numeral 104. The releasable supporting<br>
mechanism 94 further includes a retaining element in the form of a tongue 100. The<br>
tongue 100 is in the form of a plate having an aperture 102 extending out of a side<br>
thereof into which the end 104 of the piston rod 98 is received. An opposed end of the<br>
tongue 100 includes a pair of laterally spaced fork members 106. An arcuately shaped<br>
end wall 108 extends between the fork members 106.<br>
The tray assembly 82 further includes a cover plate 122 which is generally<br><br>
extend through opposed major sides of the cover plate 122. An end face 96.1 of the<br>
cylinder 96 is provided with a pair of laterally spaced supporting pins (not shown). The<br>
mechanism 94 is mounted such that the supporting pins extend into the apertures 110<br>
and such that the piston rod 98 extends along the slot 88 and protrudes into the recess<br>
86. In this position, the tongue 100 is slidably received in the recess 86. The cover<br>
plate 122 is positioned over the element 84 such that the apertures 116 are in register<br>
with the apertures 112 and is secured to the element 84 by means of securing elements<br>
(not shown) passing through the apertures 116, 112 thereby to retain the mechanism 94<br>
in position. The cover plate 122 includes a circular aperture 120 which, as can best be<br>
seen in Figure 2 of the drawings, when the cover plate 122 is mounted in position, is in<br>
register with the aperture 92 to provide a circular cylindrical passage 121 (see Figure<br>
3A) which extends through the tray assembly 82.<br>
When the cylinder 96 is actuated to withdraw the piston rod 98 the tongue<br>
element 100 is withdrawn into the recess 86 in a direction generally indicated by the<br>
arrow labelled with reference numeral 101 such that the fork members 106 are clear of<br>
the passage defined by the apertures 120, 92 to allow free movement therethrough.<br>
When the cylinder 96 is actuated to extend the piston rod 98 in a direction shown by<br>
reference numeral 103 the tongue 100 is slidably displaced within the recess 86 such<br>
that the fork members 106 extend into the passage for supporting the support 200, as is<br>
described in more detail below. As can be seen in Figure 3A of the drawings, the fork<br>
members 106 and part of the tongue 100 adjacent the side wall 108 extend into the<br>
passage 121 when in the extended position.<br>
Referring now to Figure 1 of the drawings, the electromagnetic inducing<br>
means 18 is in the form of a spirally wound induction coil 130 which extends along a<br>
length of the treatment zone 12 and is supported by the support assembly 30. The<br>
cooling means 16 is in the form of a plurality of spirally wound flow pipes 132 which are<br>
positioned between adjacent coil elements of the induction coil 130. The pipes 132 are<br>
independently operable along the length of the treatment zones. Thus, different air flow<br>
rates may be provided at different positions along a length of the treatment zone 12<br>
thereby to control the temperature gradient. The induction coil 130 and the pipes 132<br>
extend along the length of the first treatment zone 12 to provide a jacket which defines a<br>
generally circular cylindrical passage which is in register with the passage 121 provided<br><br>
Two further treatment zones 12.1 and 12.2 are supported by the support<br>
assembly 30 above the treatment zone 12. The treatment zones 12.1 and 12.2 are<br>
arranged in series and are vertically aligned with the treatment zone 12 such that their<br>
passages are in register with the passages of the treatment zone 12. Each of the<br>
treatment zones 12.1 and 12.2 is provided with cooling means and electromagnetic field<br>
inducing means 18 which is the same as that which is provided in the treatment zone 12<br>
and, therefore, is not described again in detail.<br>
The pipes 132 and the similar pipes of the treatment zones 12.1 and 12.2 are<br>
connected to a gaseous supply, for example an air supply, by means of a piping<br>
network (not shown). The flow of air to the pipes 132 is controlled by means of nozzles<br>
134.<br>
The coil 130 and coils of the treatment zones 12.1 and 12.2 are connected in<br>
series to an induction generator supplying current ranging from approximately 100 to<br>
12000 amps at a frequency from 60 Hz to 30000 Hz. The electromagnetic field induces<br>
turbulence and vibratory motion in the charge to facilitate the growth of the primary<br>
crystals instead of the dendritic crystals.<br>
Referring to Figures 1 and 8 of the drawings, temperature sensing means,<br>
generally indicated by reference numeral 140, is mounted on the support assembly 30.<br>
The temperature sensing means 140 includes a vertically extending support arm 142<br>
which is mounted on the assembly 30. As can best be seen in Figure 8 of the drawings,<br>
a supporting arrangement 144 is connected by a bracket 145 to the arm 142 and<br>
extends horizontally from the support arm 142. The arrangement 144 includes a<br>
mounting block 146 which carries a pair of elongate support elements 148. The<br>
elements 148 are slidably displaceable in a horizontal direction 148.1 within the block<br>
146 on being actuated by a pneumatic cylinder (not shown). The elements 148 are<br>
connected by a flange 147 to a further mounting block 150 from which a pair of further<br>
supporting elements 152 extend in a vertical direction. The elements 152 are<br>
displaceable in a vertical direction 152.1 in a similar fashion to the elements 148. A<br>
temperature sensing head 154 is mounted to the free end of the vertically extending<br>
conducting elements 152. In use, the sensor head 154 is positioned at an exit from the<br>
treatment zone 12.2 and is provided with thermocouples 159 which measure<br>
appropriate temperature readings of semi-solid metal in a container 14 as it is removed<br><br>
from the treatment zone 12.2, as is described in more detail below. The thermocouples<br>
159 are of different length to provide a temperature profile across a length of the<br>
container 14.<br>
Referring to Figures 5 and 6 of the drawings, the pedestal or charge support<br>
200 includes a generally circular cylindrical body 190. The body 190 includes a circular<br>
cylindrical upper part 156 and a circular cylindrical lower part 158 between which is<br>
provided a waist 192 of reduced diameter. As can best be seen in Figure 5 of the<br>
drawings, an annular gap 151 is defined between opposed circumferentially extending<br>
faces 166 and 168 of the upper and lower parts 156, 158. The faces 166, 168 and the<br>
waist 192 define an engagement formation into which the fork members 106 are<br>
received, as is described in more detail below, and as is shown schematically by<br>
reference numeral 202 in Figure 5 of the drawings.<br>
A frusto-conical seat formation 160 extends from the lower part 158 and<br>
defines a circular cylindrical seat 180 (see Figure 6 of the drawings) which seats on the<br>
supporting surface 65 of the charging arrangement 20. A head portion 182 (see Figure<br>
6 of the drawings) protrudes from the upper part 156. A ring 162 is fitted onto the head<br>
portion 182. An upper edge of the ring 162 protrudes beyond the head portion 182 and,<br>
as can be seen in Figure 5 of the drawings, defines a seat 184. The support is made of<br>
a ceramic material.<br>
Referring to Figure 7 of the drawings, the container 14 includes a barrel 220<br>
of, for example, austenitic stainless steel. Typically, the barrel has a wall thickness of<br>
about 1.6 mm to 4.0 mm. A circumferentiaily extending rim 222 is provided at a lower<br>
end of the barrel 220 and a base element 224 is inserted into the barrel, from the top, as<br>
is indicated by the arrow 223 such that the base 224 seats against the rim 222. The<br>
base element 224 may be pushed out in order to eject a slurry billet from the container<br>
14 in semi-solid state.<br>
The operation of the unit 31, the mechanism 94, the induction coils 130, the<br>
nozzles 134 and the temperature sensing means 140 may be linked to an automated<br>
computer process control unit mounted in a control box 17 (see Figure 1) to control the<br>
apparatus 10 and method in the manner described below.<br><br>
Referring now to figure 9 of the drawings, the induction coil 130 is provided<br>
with two end connections 250, 252 which are connected to an AC power supply (not<br>
shown). A plurality of helical turns 253 are provided between the end sections 250,<br>
252. The turns 253 are longitudinally spaced to provide a plurality of gaps 255 along<br>
the length of the coil 130. The charge cooling means 16 includes a plurality of tube<br>
sections 256, 258, 260, 262 and 264 each of which follows a helical path. The upper of<br>
the tube sections 256 is provided with an inlet 262 at its upper end through which<br>
gaseous coolant passes. The tube section 256 terminates at an outlet 264 from which<br>
the gaseous coolant is returned to its supply point. The second of the tube sections 258<br>
is provided with an inlet 266 for gaseous coolant which is adjacent to the outlet 264 and<br>
terminates in a lower outlet 268. Similar independent circuits are provided in respect of<br>
the remaining tube sections 260, 262 and 264 and are not described in detail. When<br>
the apparatus is assembled, the tube sections 256 to 264 are positioned between the<br>
adjacent turns 255 of the induction coil 130 along the length of the induction coil to<br>
provide a jacket which includes five independently operable cooling circuits (to provide<br>
more flexible control of the cooling along the length of the treatment zone) and<br>
electromagnetic field inducing means (which provides the turbulence and vibratory<br>
motion). Each of the tube sections 256 to 264 are provided with circumferentially<br>
spaced inwardly directed apertures 270 (only a few of which are shown in Figure 9 of<br>
the diagrams) to direct the gaseous coolant into the treatment zones 12, 12.1 and 12.2.<br>
The tube sections 256 to 264, when positioned in the induction coil 130, are secured to<br>
the induction coil 130 by brazing upper and lower portions of the turns of the tube<br>
section 256 to 264 to adjacent portions of the induction coil 130.<br>
In use, when in the starting position shown in Figure 1 of the drawings, the<br>
support 200 is positioned on the arm 48 such that the seat 180 rests on the supporting<br>
surface 65 and the gripping means 60 is actuated, via the control unit, such that the<br>
fingers 63 are displaced inwardly and engage with the lower part 158 of the support<br>
200. The container 14 is positioned on the support 200 such that the lower part thereof<br>
is received in the seat 184 defined by the protruding head 182 and the ring 162.<br>
Molten alloy, which is superheated to from about 15 °C to 50 °C above the<br>
alloy's melting temperature, is poured into the container 14 which is maintained at<br>
ambient temperature. The container 14 is coated with a refractory solution to prevent<br>
the container walls from being wetted with molten  material and to enable easy<br><br>
discharge of the semi-solid alloy or slurry from the container 14 after the process has<br>
been completed.<br>
With the container 14 charged with the molten metal alloy, the drive unit 31 is<br>
activated in order to displace the arm 48 along the short stroke (via actuation of the<br>
cylinder 46) in the direction indicated by the arrow 58 (as is described above with<br>
reference to Figure 4) so that the container 14 is displaced along the linear path 26 from<br>
the starting position to a position in which the leading end of the container 14 is level<br>
with the tray assembly 82. Thereafter, the container 14 is advanced into the treatment<br>
zone 12 by displacement along the long stroke (via actuation of the cylinder 40). During<br>
this process, the cylinder 96 of the supporting arrangement 70 is actuated such that the<br>
tongue 100 is in a retracted position to enable the container 14 to pass through the<br>
aperture 92 and 120, into a position in which the annular gap 151 is in register with the<br>
recess 86 and the fingers 63 are received in the slots 92.1. Once the container 14 is in<br>
position, the cylinder 96 is actuated such that the fork members 106 protrude into the<br>
annular gap 151, as is described above, and the supporting surfaces 166 of the support<br>
200 rest on the fork members 106 and the arcuate side wall 108 fits snugly around part<br>
of the waist 150. The drive unit 31 is then activated by releasing the gripping means 60<br>
and displacing the arm 48 back to the starting position with the container 14 remaining<br>
supported by the fork members 106.<br>
The induction coils 130 are activated in order to induce turbulent flow and to<br>
provide the vibratory field in the molten charge. Simultaneously therewith, the flow of air<br>
through the nozzles 134 is regulated in order to provide desired cooling and to provide a<br>
first nucleation cycle in the treatment zone 12. Typically, the charge is cooled uniformly<br>
along the length of the container with a variance of about ± 3 °C.<br>
After the desired time in the first treatment zone 12, a further support 200 and<br>
container 14 of molten metal are advanced along the short stroke towards the first<br>
treatment zone 12 (as is described above) until a leading upper end of the container 14<br>
abuts the seat 180 of the support 200 positioned in the treatment zone 12. Since the<br>
further container 14 now supports the container 14 in the treatment zone 12, the<br>
cylinder 96 is actuated in order to retract the tongue 100 so that the fork members 106<br>
are clear of the passage. The further container 14 is then urged by displacement along<br>
the long stroke into the first treatment zone 12.  This fresh charge abuts the container<br><br>
14 that was originally in the treatment zone 12 and displaces it into the next treatment<br>
zone 12.1 where it is supported in position by the seat 180 resting on a leading end of<br>
the fresh container 14 now positioned in the first treatment zone 12. A subsequent<br>
charge is introduced into the treatment zone 12 in the same manner which advances<br>
the charge 14 in the treatment zone 12.1 into the treatment zone 12.2 and, similarly<br>
advances the container 14 in the treatment zone 12 into the treatment zone 12.1. When<br>
the next container 14 is being collected the stack of containers in the treatment zones<br>
12, 12.1 and 12.2 are supported by the fork member 106 supporting the lowermost<br>
container 14.<br>
After a desired time period in the treatment zone 12.2, a temperature reading<br>
is taken by inserting the sensing head 154 into the upper opening of the uppermost<br>
container 14. The sensing head 154 is manipulated into and out of position by actuation<br>
of the elements 148 and 152. The second and third treatment zones 12.1 and 12.2<br>
include a further stirring and controlled cooling process in order to narrow the nucleation<br>
process to obtain the desired semi-solid temperature and microstructure.<br>
The process is continued by feeding a fresh container 14 into the first<br>
treatment zone 12.1 and, thereby, advancing each of the containers 14 in the train one<br>
position up in order to eject the uppermost container 14 from the apparatus 10. By<br>
measuring the temperature just prior to ejection, the sample that is removed from the<br>
treatment zone 12.2 may serve to make adjustments to the cooling rate in order to<br>
obtain the desired temperature on leaving the treatment zone 12.2.<br>
After a container 14 is ejected from the treatment zone 12.2, either manually<br>
or by an automated device, the container 14 is transferred to the shot sleeve of a high<br>
pressure die-casting (HPDC) machine for further forming in the semi-soiid state.<br>
Table 1 below shows a breakdown of the times and the sequential<br>
advancement of various containers or cups through the apparatus 10.<br><br>
An example using the apparatus 10 and the method of the invention is now<br>
described. The apparatus 10 and method find particular application for light alloys such<br>
as aluminium, magnesium and zinc alloys.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
An aluminium-silicon alloy A356 is melted in a melting furnace at a<br>
temperature from 720 °C to 780 °C and then transferred to a holding furnace. A dosing<br>
furnace which provides protective gas on the molten metal surface and is able to pour a<br>
desired quantity of liquid alloy in a container was used. The temperature change of the<br>
metal alloy during pouring is controlled within a range of ± 1 °C to 2 °C of the desired<br>
temperature. The pouring temperature was 629 °C to 631 °C. The liquid metal at that<br>
temperature is poured onto the wall of the container 14, tilted at about 30 ° to 40 ° with<br>
respect to a vertical axis. The first container 14 with liquid metal alloy is transferred to<br>
the supporting surface 65 by hand or by a 6 axis robot, placed onto the support 200,<br>
and then transported by the drive unit 31 to the first treatment zone 12.1. At about one<br>
minute intervals, second and third containers 14 are introduced into the apparatus so<br>
that the first container is positioned in the treatment zone 12.2. The temperature<br>
sensing means 140 is then used to measure the final temperature and to adjust the rate<br>
of cooling in order to achieve the final temperature profile of the semi-solid slurry, if<br>
required. The subsequent containers are ejected by adding additional containers 14.<br>
The ejected containers are then ready for robotic or manual casting and are ejected into<br>
the shot sleeve of the die-casting machine.<br>
Set out in Figure 10 is a photograph of the microstructure of the alloy in<br>
accordance with the example viewed through a Scanning Optical Microscope. The<br>
primary Aluminium crystals (A) are interspersed in a eutectic mixture (B) of AL-Si-Mg<br>
with an absence of dentritic crystallization<br>
The Applicant believes that it is an advantage of the invention that by aligning<br>
the conditioning or treatment zones 12,12.1 and 12.2 vertically, and by advancing the<br>
container 14 along the linear path 26, the problem of using a relatively large floor space<br>
which is associated with more complex and cumbersome apparatus of which the<br>
Applicant is aware, is alleviated. Thus, it is expected that the capital cost of such<br>
apparatus is relatively low. The end-to-end and stepwise or sequential advancement of<br>
the containers 14 through the treatment zones 12, 12.1 and 12.2, with simultaneous<br>
controlled cooling and stirring in each of the treatment zones, provides a simplified<br>
method in a compact apparatus which is able to offer the desired tight process control<br>
typical of the rheo-casting process, in order to obtain the desired microstructure and<br>
desired semi-solid temperature for treatment in the high pressure die-casting machine,<br>
as compared to apparatus and processes of which the Applicant is aware. The circular<br>
cylindrical passages with the "jacket" of cooling provide relatively uniform temperature<br>
distribution through the charge. The Applicant also believes that the simultaneous<br>
cooling and stirring provides a relatively shorter process and improves the structural<br>
characteristics of the semi-solid metals as compared to apparatus and methods of<br>
which the Applicant is aware. The Applicant also believes that the end-to-end stacking<br>
provides a relatively closed environment during processing thereby alleviating the<br>
problem of oxidation. The Applicant believes that the apparatus and method lends itself<br>
easily to be incorporated into existing SSM thixo-casting HPDC machines which opens<br>
opportunities to adopt SSM technology or to switch from the thixo-casting to the rheo-<br>
casting process with relatively low investment costs. The apparatus and method is<br>
flexible in that the number of treatment zones may be altered to suit the process, alloy<br>
requirement and the cycle time with minimum modifications to the apparatus. In<br>
addition, the space efficient and elegant design of the apparatus allows sizing of<br>
apparatus for the treatment of billets in excess of 7.5kg. Apparatus of which Applicant<br>
is aware are less suitable at this size owing to the economic constraints imposed by the<br>
nature of the design.<br><br>
