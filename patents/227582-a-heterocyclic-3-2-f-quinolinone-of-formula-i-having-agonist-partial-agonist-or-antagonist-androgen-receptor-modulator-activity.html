Related Application<br>
The present application claims the benefit of priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/271,189, filed on February 23, 2001 which is incorporated by reference in its entirety.<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to non-steroidal compounds that are modulators (i.e. agonists, partial agonists and antagonists) of androgen receptors and to methods for making and using such compounds.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Intracellular receptors (IRs) form a class of structurally-related genetic regulators scientists have named "ligand dependent transcription factors" (R. M. Evans, Science, 240:889, 1988)'. Sex steroid hormone receptors are a recognized subset of the IRs, including androgen receptor (AR), progesterone receptor (PR) and estrogen receptor (ER). Regulation of a gene by such factors requires both the receptor itself and a corresponding ligand, which has the ability to selectively bind to the receptor in a way that affects gene transcription.<br>
The natural hormones for sex steroid receptors have been known for a long time, such as testosterone for AR and progesterone for PR. A compound that binds to a receptor and mimics the effect of the native hormone is referred to as an "agonist", while a compound that inhibits the effect of the native hormone is called an "antagonist." The term "modulators" refers to compounds that are agonists, partial agonists or antagonists.<br>
Synthetic female sex hormones have been widely used in oral contraception, hormone replacement therapy and the treatment of hormone-dependent disorders. The development of new generations of selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) significantly improved women's health. On the other hand, similar hormone therapy for men has not been fully explored due to lack of availability of selective, orally administered, safe agents.<br><br>
A group of hydroquinoline derivatives was recently described as AR modulators (e.g., U.S.<br>
Patent No. 5,696,130). The compounds described in U.S. Patent No. 5,696,130 include<br>
.indeno[l ,2-g]quinolines,	indeno[l ,2-f]quinolines,	benzo[b]furano[3,2-g]quinolines,<br>
denzo[b]furano[2,3-y]quinolines,	indolo[3,2-g]quinolines,	indolo[2,3-f]quinolines,<br>
coumarino[3,4-/]quinolines, coumarino[3,4-f]quinolines, 8-pyranono[5,6-g]quinolines, 10-isocoumarino[4,3-g]quinolines, 10-isoquinolino[4,3-g]quinolines, 8-pyridono[5,6-g]quinolines, 10H-isochromeno-[4,3-g]quinolines, 8H-pyrano[3,2-g-]quinolines, 10-thioisoquinolino[4,3-g]-quinolines, 9-pyrido[3,2-g]quinolines, 8-thiopyranono[5,6-g]quinolines, 6-pyridono[5,6-g]quinolines, 9-thiopyran-8-ono[5,6-g]qumolmes, 7-pyridono[5,6-f]indolines and 5H-isochromeno[3,4-/|quinolines. This group of modulators was developed by using cell-based high-throughput assays, termed cotransfection assays. U.S. Patent No. 5,696,130 does not describe any heterocyclic angular tricyclic or tetracyclic [3,2-f]-quinolinones, [3,2-f]quinoline thiones, [3,2-f]-quinolinimines or [3,2-f]-quinolinone oximes. This group of AR modulators was developed by using cell-based high-throughput assays, termed cotransfection assays.<br>

Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention is directed to tricyclic androgen receptor modulator compounds. This invention is also directed to pharmaceutical compositions containing such compounds as well as methods of using such compounds and pharmaceutical compositions for modulating processes mediated by androgen receptor (AR). More particularly, the invention relates to nonsteroidal compounds and compositions that may be high affinity, high specificity agonists, partial agonists (i.e., partial activators and/or tissue-specific activators) or antagonists for androgen receptor. Also provided are methods of making such compounds and pharmaceutical compositions, as well as intermediates used in their synthesis.<br>

etc.) correspond to the specific substitution patterns noted in the Examples. However, it<br>
will be understood by those skilled in the art that other functionalities disclosed herein at<br>
the indicated positions of compounds of formulas I through VIII are also potential<br>

The compounds of the present invention also include racemates, stereoisomers,<br>
optically pure enantiomers and mixtures of said compounds, including isotopically-labeled<br>
and radio-labeled compounds. Such isomers can be isolated by standard resolution<br>
techniques, including fractional crystallization and chiral column chromatography.<br>
As noted above, the androgen receptor modulator compounds of the present<br>
invention can be combined in a mixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier to<br>
provide pharmaceutical compositions useful for treating the biological conditions or<br>
disorders noted herein in mammalian and particularly in human patients. The particular<br>
carrier employed in these pharmaceutical compositions may take a wide variety of forms<br>
depending upon the type of administration desired. Suitable administration routes include<br>
enteral (e.g., oral), topical, suppository and parenteral (e.g., intravenous, intramuscular and<br>
subcutaneous).<br>
In preparing the compositions in oral liquid dosage forms (e.g., suspensions, elixirs<br>
and solutions), typical pharmaceutical media, such as water, glycols, oils, alcohols,<br>
flavoring agents, preservatives, coloring agents and the like can be employed. Similarly,<br>
when preparing oral solid dosage forms (e.g., powders, tablets and capsules), carriers such<br>
as starches, sugars, diluents, granulating agents, lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents<br>
and the like may be employed. Due to their ease of administration, tablets and capsules<br>
represent a desirable oral dosage form for the pharmaceutical compositions of the present<br>
invention.<br>
For parenteral administration, the carrier typically will include sterile water,<br>
although other ingredients that aid in solubility or serve as preservatives, may also be<br>
included. Furthermore, injectable suspensions may also be prepared, in which case<br>
appropriate liquid carriers, suspending agents and the like may be employed.<br>
For topical administration, the compounds of the present invention may be<br>
formulated using bland, moisturizing bases, such as ointments or creams. Examples of<br>
suitable ointment bases are petrolatum, petrolatum plus volatile silicones, lanolin and<br>
water in oil emulsions such as Eucerin™, available from Beiersdorf (Cincinnati, Ohio).<br>
Examples of suitable cream bases are Nivea™ Cream, available from Beiersdorf<br>
(Cincinnati, Ohio), cold cream (USP), Purpose Cream™, available from Johnson &amp;<br>
Johnson (New Brunswick, New Jersey), hydrophilic ointment (USP) and Lubriderm™,<br>
available from Warner-Lambert (Morris Plains, New Jersey).<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions and compounds of the present invention<br>
generally will be administered in the form of a dosage unit (e.g., tablet, capsule, etc.). The<br>
compounds of the present invention generally are administered in a daily dosage of from<br>
about 1 p-g/kg of body weight to about 500 mg/kg of body weight. Typically, the<br>
compounds of the present invention are administered in a daily dosage of from about 10<br>
ug/kg to about 250 mg/kg of body weight. Most often, the compounds of the present<br>
invention are administered in a daily dosage of from about 20 (J.g/kg to about 100 mg/kg<br>
body weight. As recognized by those skilled in the art, the particular quantity of<br>
pharmaceutical composition according to the present invention administered to a patient<br>
will depend upon a number of factors, including, without limitation, the biological activity<br>
desired, the condition of the patient and the patient's tolerance for the drug.<br>
The compounds of this invention also have utility when labeled (e.g., radiolabeled,<br>
isotopically-labeled and the like) as ligands for use in assays to determine the<br>
presence of AR in a cell background or extract. They are particularly useful due to their<br>
ability to selectively activate androgen receptors and can therefore be used to determine<br>
the presence of such receptors in the presence of other steroid receptors or related<br>
intracellular receptors.<br>
These invention methods comprise contacting the cell or cell extract with the<br>
compounds of the present invention which have been labeled and testing the contacted cell<br>
or cell extract to determine the presence of AR.' Testing can be accomplished via testing<br>
for activation of androgen receptor(s) (e.g., via elevated presence of the product of<br>
androgen mediated process(es)), via separation of the bound compound/receptor<br>
combination and the like, which techniques are known to those of skill in the art.<br>
Due to the selective specificity of the compounds of this invention for steroid<br>
receptors, these compounds can be used to purify samples of steroid receptors in vitro.<br>
Such purification can be carried out by mixing samples containing steroid receptors with<br>
one or more of the compounds of the present invention so that the compounds bind to the<br>
receptors of choice and then isolating the bound ligand/receptor combination by separation<br>
techniques which are known to those of skill in the art. These techniques include column<br>
separation, filtration, centrifugation, tagging and physical separation and antibody<br>
complexing, among others.<br>
The compounds and pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention can be<br>
used in the treatment of the diseases and conditions described herein. In this regard, the<br>
compounds and compositions of the present invention may prove particularly useful as<br>
modulators of male sex steroid-dependent diseases and conditions such as the treatment of<br>
hypogonadism, sexual dysfunction, acne, male-pattern baldness, wasting diseases,<br>
hirsutism, prostatic hyperplasia, osteoporosis, impotence, cancer cachexia, various<br>
hormone-dependent cancers, including, without limitation, prostate and breast cancer. The<br>
compounds of the present invention may also prove useful in male hormone replacement<br>
therapy, stimulation of hematopoiesis, male contraception and as anabolic agents.<br>
The compounds of the present invention may be extremely potent activators of AR,<br>
displaying 50% maximal activation of AR (e.g., activation of AR, determined by<br>
measurement of luciferase production levels compared to levels achieved by<br>
dihydrotestosterone (DHT)) at a concentration of less than 100 nM (Cotransfection assay<br>
concentration), at a concentration of less than 50 nM, at a concentration of less than 20<br>
nM, or even at a concentration of 10 nM or less. (See, for example, Biological Examples.)<br>
Alternatively, the compounds of the present invention may be extremely potent<br>
inhibitors of AR, displaying 50% maximal inhibition of AR (e.g., inhibition of AR,<br>
determined by measurement of luciferase production levels compared to levels achieved<br>
by dihydrotestosterone (DHT)) at a concentration of less than 100 nM (Cotransfection<br>
assay concentration), at a concentration of less than 50 nM, at a concentration of less than<br>
20 nM, or even at a concentration of 10 nM or less. (See, for example, Biological<br>
Examples.)<br>
In one embodiment, the selective compounds of the present invention generally do<br>
not display undesired cross-reactivity with other steroid receptors, as is seen with the<br>
compound mifepristone (RU486; Roussel Uclaf), a known PR antagonist that displays an<br>
undesirable cross reactivity on GR and AR, thereby limiting its use in long-term, chronic<br>
administration.<br>
The invention will be further illustrated by reference to the following non - limiting<br>
Examples.<br>

Steroid Receptor Activity<br>
Utilizing the "cis-trans" or "co-transfection" assay described by Evans et al.,<br>
Science. 240:889-95 (May 13, 1988), the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference<br>
herein , the compounds of the present invention were tested and found to have strong,<br>
specific activity as agonists, partial agonists and antagonists of AR. This assay is<br>
described in further detail in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,981,784 and 5,071,773, the disclosures of<br>
which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The co-transfection assay provides a method for identifying functional agonists<br>
and partial agonists which mimic, or antagonists which inhibit, the effect of native<br>
hormones and quantifying their activity for responsive IR proteins. In this regard, the cotransfection<br>
assay mimics an in vivo system in the laboratory. Importantly, activity in the<br>
co-transfection assay correlates very well with known in vivo activity, such that the cotransfection<br>
assay functions as a qualitative and quantitative predictor of a tested<br>
compoundsjH vz'vo pharmacology. See, e.g., T. Berger et al. 41 J. SteroidBiochem.<br>
Molec. Biol. 773 (1992), the disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference.<br>
In the co-transfection assay, a cloned cDNA for an IR (e.g., human PR, AR or GR)<br>
under the control of a constitutive promoter (e.g., the SV 40 promoter) is introduced by<br>
transfection (a procedure to induce cells to take up foreign genes) into a background cell<br>
substantially devoid of endogenous IRs. This introduced gene directs the recipient cells to<br>
make the IR protein of interest. A second gene is also introduced (co-transfected) into the<br>
same cells in conjunction with the IR gene. This second gene, comprising the cDNA for a<br>
reporter protein, such as firefly luciferase (LUC), controlled by an appropriate hormone<br>
responsive promoter containing a hormone response element (HRE). This reporter "<br>
plasmid functions as a reporter for the transcription-modulating activity of the target IR.<br>
Thus, the reporter acts as a surrogate for the products (mRNA then protein) normally<br>
expressed by a gene under control of the target receptor and its native hormone.<br>
The co-transfection assay can detect small molecule agonists or antagonists of<br>
target IRs. Exposing the transfected cells to an agonist ligand compound increases<br>
reporter activity in the transfected cells. This activity can be conveniently measured, e.g.,<br>
by increasing luciferase production, which reflects compound-dependent, IR-mediated<br>
increases in reporter transcription. A partial agonist's activity can be detected in a manner<br>
similar to that of the full agonist, except that the maximum measured activity, e.g.,<br>
luciferase production, is less than that of an agonist standard. For example, for AR,'a<br>
partial agonist can be detected by measuring increased luciferase production, but the<br>
maximum effect at high concentration is less than the maximum effect for<br>
dihydrotestosterone. To detect antagonists, the co-transfection assay is carried out in the<br>
presence of a constant concentration of an agonist to the target DR. (e.g., progesterone for<br>
PR) known to induce a denned reporter signal. Increasing concentrations of a suspected<br>
antagonist will decrease the reporter signal (e.g., luciferase production). The cotransfection<br>
assay is therefore useful to detect both agonists and antagonists of specific<br>
IRs. Furthermore, it determines not only whether a compound interacts with a particular<br>
IR, but whether this interaction mimics (agonizes) or blocks (antagonizes) the effects of<br>
the native regulatory molecules on target gene expression, as well as the specificity and<br>
strength of this interaction.<br>
The activity of selected steroid receptor modulator compounds of the present<br>
invention were evaluated utilizing the co-transfection assay and in standard IR binding<br>
assays, according to the following illustrative Examples.<br>
Co-transfection assay<br>
CV-1 cells (African green monkey kidney fibroblasts) were cultured in the<br>
presence of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10%<br>
charcoal resin-stripped fetal bovine serum then transferred to 96-well microtiter plates one<br>
day prior to transfection.<br>
To determine AR agonist and antagonist activity of the compounds of the present<br>
invention, the CV-1 cells were transiently transfected by calcium phosphate<br>
coprecipitation according to the procedure of Berger et al., 41 J. Steroid Biochem. Mol.<br>
Biol, 733 (1992) with the following plasmids: pShAR (5 ng/well), MTV-LUC reporter<br>
(100 ng/well), pRS-B-Gal (50 ng/well) and filler DNA (pGEM; 45 ng/well). The receptor<br>
plasmid, pRShAR, contains the human AR under constitutive control of the S V-40<br>
promoter, as more fully described in J.A. Simental et al., "Transcriptional activation and<br>
nuclear targeting signals of the human androgen receptor", 266 J. Biol. Chem., 510 (1991).<br>
The reporter plasmid, MTV-LUC, contains the cDNA for firefly luciferase (LUC)<br>
under control of the mouse mammary tumor virus (MTV) long terminal repeat, a<br>
conditional promoter containing an androgen response element. See e.g., Berger et al.<br>
supra. In addition, pRS-B-Gal, coding for constitutive expression of E. coli Bgalactosidase<br>
(B-Gal), was included as an internal control for evaluation of transfection<br>
efficiency and compound toxicity.<br>
Six hours after transfection, media was removed and the cells were washed with<br>
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Media containing reference compounds (i.e.<br>
progesterone as a PR agonist, mifepristone ((llp,17p)-ll-[4-(dimethylamino)phenyl]-17-<br>
hydroxy-17-(l-propynyl)estra-4,9-dien-3-one: RU486; Roussel Uclaf) as aPR antagonist;<br>
dihydrotestosterone (DHT; Sigma Chemical) as an AR agonist and 2-OH-flutamide (the<br>
active metabolite of 2-methyl-N-[4-nitro-3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]pronanamide;<br>
Schering-Plough) as an AR antagonist; estradiol (Sigma) as an ER agonist and ICI<br>
164,384 (N-butyl-3;17-dihydroxy-N-methyl-(7-a,17-p)-estra-l)3,5(10)-triene-7-<br>
undecanamide; ICI Americas) as an ER antagonist; dexamethasone (Sigma) as a GR<br>
agonist and RU486 as a GR antagonist; and aldosterone (Sigma) as a MR agonist and<br>
spironolactone ((7-a-[acetylthio]-17-a-hydroxy-3-oxopregn-4-ene-21-carboxylic acid ylactone;<br>
Sigma) as an MR antagonist) and/or the modulator compounds of the present<br>
invention in concentrations ranging from 10" to 10" M were added to the cells. Three<br>
to four replicates were used for each sample. Transfections and subsequent procedures<br>
were performed on a Biomek 1000 automated laboratory work station.<br>
After 40 hours, the cells were washed with PBS, lysed with a Triton X-l 00-based<br>
buffer and assayed for LUC and 13-Gal activities using a luminometer or<br>
spectrophotometer, respectively. For each replicate, the normalized response (NR) was<br>
calculated as:<br>
LUC response/ß-Gal rate<br>
where B-Gal rate = ß-GaMxlO-5/ß-Gal incubation time.<br>
The mean and standard error of the mean (SEM) of the NR were calculated. Data<br>
was plotted as the response of the compound compared to the reference compounds over<br>
the range of the dose-response curve. For agonist experiments, the effective concentration<br>
that produced 50% of the maximum response (ECso) was quantified. Agonist efficacy<br>
was a function (%) of LUC expression relative to the maximum LUC production by the<br>
reference agonist for PR, AR, ER, GR or MR. Antagonist activity was determined by<br>
testing the amount of LUC expression in the presence of a fixed amount of DHT as an AR<br>
agonist and progesterone as a PR agonist at the ECso concentration. The concentration of<br>
test compound that inhibited 50% of LUC expression induced by the reference agonist was<br>
quantified (IC5Q)- In addition, the efficacy of antagonists was determined as a function<br>
(%) of maximal inhibition.<br>
IR Binding assay<br>
AR Bjnding: For the whole cell binding assay, COS-1 cells in 96-well microtiter<br>
plates containing DMEM-10% FBS were transfected as described above with the<br>
95<br>
following plasmid DNA: pRShAR (2 ng/well), pRS-B-Gal (50 ng/well) and pGEM (48<br>
ng/well). Six hours after transfection, media was removed, the cells were washed with<br>
PBS and fresh media was added. The next day, the media was changed to DMEM-serum<br>
free to remove any endogenous ligand that might be complexed with the receptor in the<br>
cells.<br>
After 24 hours in serum-free media, either a saturation analysis to determine the<br>
Kd for tritiated dihydrotestosterone (^H-DHT) on human AR or a competitive binding<br>
assay to evaluate the ability of test compounds to compete with ^H-DHT for AR was<br>
performed. For the saturation analysis, media (DMEM-0.2% CA-FBS) containing ^HDHT<br>
(in concentrations ranging from 12 nM to 0.24 nM) in the absence (total binding) or<br>
presence (non-specific binding) of a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled DHT were added<br>
to the cells. For the competitive binding assay, media containing 1 nM ^H-DHT and test<br>
compounds in concentrations ranging from 10~10 to 10~6 M were added to the cells.<br>
Three replicates were used for each sample. After three hours at 37°C, an aliquot of the<br>
total binding media at each concentration of ^H-DHT was removed to estimate the amount<br>
of free ^H-DHT. The remaining media was removed, the cells were washed three times<br>
with PBS to remove unbound ligand and cells were lysed with a Triton X-100-based<br>
buffer. The lysates were assayed for amount of bound ^H-DHT and B-Gal activity using a<br>
scintillation counter or spectrophotometer, respectively.<br>
For the saturation analyses, the difference between the total binding and the<br>
nonspecific binding, normalized by the fi-Gal rate, was defined as specific binding. The<br>
specific binding was evaluated by Scatchard analysis to determine the K<j for></j>

In: J. Langon and J.J. Clapp, eds., Ligand Assay, Masson Publishing U.S.A., Inc., New<br>
York, pp. 45-99, (1981), the disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference. For<br>
the competition studies, the data was plotted as the amount of ^H-DHT (% of control in<br>
the absence of test compound) remaining over the range of the dose-response curve for a<br>
given compound. The concentration of test compound that inhibited 50% of the amount of<br>
bound in the absence of competing ligand was quantified (IC5Q) after log-logit<br>
transformation. The Kj values were determined by application of the Cheng-Prusoff<br>
equation to the IC5Q values, where:<br>

After correcting for non-specific binding, IC5Q values were determined. The IC5Q<br>
value is defined as the concentration of competing ligand needed to reduce specific<br>
binding by 50%. The ICso value was determined graphically from a log-logit plot of the<br>
data. The K; values were determined by application of the Cheng-Prusoff equation to the<br>
