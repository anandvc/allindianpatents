The present invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of 4-(N, N-disubstitutedamino)butyraldehyde acetals. The 4-(N, N-disubstitutedamino) butyraldehyde acetals of the present invention have the formula-I given below<br><br>
The above mentioned substituted butyraldehyde derivatives of the formula-I are very important building blocks for the synthesis of various tryptamine derivatives. In particular, 4-(N, N-dimethylamino)butyraldehyde dimethyl or diethyl acetals are crucial intermediates for the synthesis of commercially available anti-migraine drugs, like sumatriptan (USP 4,816,470), zolmitriptan (WO 91 18897), and rizatriptan (EP 497512).<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
In one general synthesis for compounds of formula-I wherein R1 = R2 = C2 and above and R3 = C2, Keglevic (Croat. Chem. Acta, 35, 175, 1963) reported the synthesis of these compounds in two steps starting from propynal diethyl acetal (Scheme-I). Propynal diethyl acetal was subjected to Mannich reaction with a disubstitutedamine and formaldehyde to give the intermediate of formula-Ill. The acetylenic intermediate of the formula-Ill was subjected to complete reduction with Pd/C to get the saturated derivatives of formula-IV (R1 = R2 = C2 and above).<br><br><br>
The main disadvantage of this route is the preparation of starting acetal of formula-XIV. Preparation of this is extremely difficult on a commercial scale. It involves chromium oxidation and is not stable under normal conditions. Also, the step of high pressure hydrogenation is involved.<br>
Currently there are only three routes available in the hitherto reported literature for the preparation of compounds of the formula-I<br><br>
In the first route, Keglevic (Croat. Chem. Acta, 36(3), 103-9, 1964) reported the synthesis of compound of formula-V in 45% yield starting from 4-aminobutyraldehyde diethyl acetal of formula-VI (Scheme-II).<br><br>
Starting material used in this process (compound of formula-VI) is not commercially available and is prepared in three steps starting from acrolein (see Scheme-Ill). According to the literature (Manske, et al. Can. J. Research, 5, 598, 1931; Gribble, et al, J. Org. Chem. 1988, 53, 3164) acrolein is reacted with ethanol and HCl to give the<br><br>
chloroprionaldehyde diethyl acetal of formula-VIII. The acetal of formula-VIII is reacted with sodium or potassium cyanide to get the cyano compound of formula-IX. The overall yield of these two steps is 43%. Conversion of the cyano compound of formula-IX to the amino compound of formula-VI is reported by Burckhalter (J. Org. Chem., 23, 1278, 1958) in 91%. Therefore the overall yield of compound of formula-V is 18.5% starting from commercially available acrolein of formula-VII.<br><br>
Some of the main disadvantages in this route are:<br>
i.	Starting from commercially available acrolein the overall yield is onlyl 8.5%.<br>
ii.        Process is involving four steps.<br>
iii.       Basic raw material, acrolein is not widely available and requires special<br>
handling techniques due to  its lachrimatory nature  and  polymerization<br>
property, iv.       Requires handling of poisonous chemicals like sodium cyanide or potassium<br>
cyanide used in the second step (Scheme-Ill), v.        Requires high pressure hydrogenation used in the third step (Scheme-Ill).<br>
In the second route, reported by Takahara (JP 68 09529, CA: 68^ P107070z) the compound of the formula-X was prepared in 57% yield starting from 4-aminobutyraldehyde dimethyl acetal of formula-XI (Scheme-IV).<br><br><br>
4-Aminobutyraldehyde dimethyl acetal of formula-XI was methylated using 37% formalin under hydrogen pressure (114kg^/cm^) with 10% Pd/C to get the compound of formula-X. The starting material used in this process (compound of formula-XI) is not commercially available. It is prepared in three steps starting from acrolein as per the procedure given in literature (Manske, et al, Can. J. Research, 5, 598, 1931; Gribble, et al, J. Org. Chem. 1988, 53, 3164; Burckhalter, et al, J. Org. Chem., 23, 1278, 1958) in less than 60% yield (Scheme-V).<br><br>
In the second route main disadvantages are:<br>
i       Requires very high pressure (114 kg ^/ cm^) hydrogenation. ii      Basic raw material (compound of formula-XI) required in the process is not commercially available and is prepared in three steps (Scheme-V).<br><br>
In the third route, reported by Chen (J. Org. Chem. 59, 3738, 1994) the compound of formula-X was obtained in 66% yield in three steps starting from 4-chlorobutyryl chloride of formula-XIV (Scheme-VI). 4-Chlorobutyryl chloride was reduced under Rosenmund reduction conditions (10% Pd/C, 2,6-lutidine, 40psi hydrogen pressure) to get the 4-chlorobutyraldehyde of formula-XV. This crude aldehyde thus obtained was further reacted with methanol and sulfuric acid to get the acetal of formula-XVI. The acetal of formula-XVI was reacted with large (7 fold) excess of dimethylamine to get the compound of formula-X. The starting material (4-chlorobutyryl chloride of formula-XIV) used in the process is not commercially available. It is prepared from y-butyrolactone using excess thionyl chloride (Reppe, et al, Liebigs Ann. Chem. 596, 190, 1955) in 90% yield.<br><br>
In the third route although overall yield is good, the major disadvantages are:<br>
i.	Preparation   of  4-chlorobutyryl   chloride   involves   corrosive   chemistry<br>
(hydrogen chloride and sulfur dioxide are evolved in the process).<br>
ii. Rosenmund reduction is involved in the first step (scheme-VI). This requires a special technique (hydrogenation under pressure) and the yields can fluctuate.<br>
iii.       Large excess (7 fold) of dimethylamine is required in the last step.<br><br>
Keeping in view of the difficulties in implementing the above routes for making compounds of formula-I, which have gained importance in the recent years, we directed our research work to develop a simple, convenient and economical process for the preparation of compounds of formula-I which process is also commercially viable.<br>
The main objective of the present invention is, therefore, to provide an improved process for the preparation of compounds of the formula-I as defined above overcoming all the disadvantages present in the hitherto known processes.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the preparation of compounds of the formula-I as defined above which is simple and economical.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the preparation of compounds of the formula-I as defined above which does not require the step of high pressure hydrogenation due to which the process is safe.<br>
Still another objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the preparation of compounds of the formula I as defined above which does not involve rare, expensive, and dangerous starting materials.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the preparation of compounds of the formula-l as defined above which does not require special equipment or technique.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the preparation of compounds of the formula-I as defined above in which the yield of the final product is fairly high (&gt;70%) and better purity (&gt;98%).<br><br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the preparation of compounds of the formula-I as defined above which process is generally and widely applicable for the commercial preparation.<br>
It is known from the literature (Stetter, Chem. Ber., 103, 643, 1970) that orthoformates of<br><br>
Wherein R^ = alkyl, R^ = phenyl undergo Grignard reaction in aromatic solvent medium at the reflux temperature with alkylmagnesium halides to give one carbon extended acetals of formula-XVlII (Scheme-VII).<br><br>
It is also known from the literature (Org. Synth. Coll. Vol. VI, p776, 1988) that 3-(dimethylamino)propyl chloride of formula-XIX forms a stable Grignard reagent of formula-XX when reacted with magnesium in an aromatic solvent or ether solvent at reflux temperature (Scheme-VIII).<br><br>
Based on the above mentioned information we directed our attention towards reacting orthoformates of the formula-XVII,<br><br><br>
wherein R^ and R^ is same or different and represent Ci to Ce alkyl, C3 to C? cycloalkyl, OR R is as defined above and R represents a phenyl radical with the Grignard reagents derived from the halides of the formula-XXI,<br><br>
cycloalkyl; NR^R^ = pyrrolidine,  piperidino, morpholino, thiomorpholino, R^ =<br><br><br>
iii        Filtering the resulting reaction mixture and distilling the filtrate to isolate compound of the formula-I.<br>
The 3-(N, N-disubstitutedamino)propyl halide used in step (i) may be selected from its chloride or bromide. The solvent used in step (i) may be selected from non-polar hydrocarbon, aromatic solvent, or ether solvent, etc. Thus the solvent may be selected from benzene, toluene, xylene, hexane, cyclohexane, heptane, etc. The trisubstituted orthoformate used in step (ii) may be selected from trialkyl (methyl, ethyl, etc) or phenyl dialkyl orthoformate.<br><br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the molar ratio between the Grignard reagent and the othoformate used may be in the ratio of 1:1-3, preferably in the ratio of 1:1.2-1.5<br>
The details of the invention are described in Examples given below which are provided to illustrate the invention only and therefore should not be construed to limit the scope of the present invention.<br>
