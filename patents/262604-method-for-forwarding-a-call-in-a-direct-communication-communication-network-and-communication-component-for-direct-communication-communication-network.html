Description<br>
Method for forwarding a call in a direct-communication<br>
communication network, and communication component for direct-<br>
communication communication network<br>
The invention relates to a method for forwarding a call in<br>
accordance with the precharacterizing part of patent claim 1<br>
and to a communication component for a direct-communication<br>
communication network in accordance with the precharacterizing<br>
part of patent claim 12.<br>
In communication arrangements, incoming calls which do not<br>
reach the correct receiver directly are forwarded to the<br>
correct receiver. This is the case particularly when a caller<br>
does not know the "correct" contact, for example in a<br>
relatively large company. An incoming call of this kind can<br>
then be forwarded automatically to a person or his<br>
communication terminal. Such technical facilities for automatic<br>
distribution of incoming communication links (calls) are often<br>
also to a ACD (Automatic Call Distribution) systems and are used for what are known as call centers (Hotlines).<br>
ACD systems comprise either a special supplementary program which is part of a private exchange (communication system, communication node) or else an external appliance (server)<br>
which is connected to a communication system and prescribes for<br>
the communication system the respective relaying destination<br>
(person or his communication terminal) for an incoming call. In<br>
this context, the relaying destination is frequently also<br>
selected by evaluating information about properties of the<br>
incoming call (known as call properties). By way of example,<br><br>
the employees at a call center may have various associated<br>
geographical areas; in this case, the associate between the<br>
geographical area and an employee is an item of property<br>
information. If an incoming call involves the caller's<br>
telephone number being transmitted (Clip function), the ACD<br>
system can use the dialing code to determine the origin of the<br>
call and, through comparison with stored property information,;<br>
can determine the accordingly associated employee and hence his<br>
communication terminal as the call forwarding destination.<br>
Alternatively, the ACD system can also accept an incoming call<br>
automatically and, through voice-controlled interrogation which<br>
the caller answers using DTMF key selection, for example, can<br>
categorize it, that is to say ascertain call properties, until<br>
the correct contact or a group of correct contacts can be;<br>
determined.<br>
The document EP 1 237 347 A2 Coussement "Distributed<br>
hardware/software system for managing agent status in a<br>
communication center" discloses such an ACD system in a<br>
circuit-switched communication network. A central facility,<br>
known as the "Agent Presence Application", monitors the<br>
resources of employees (agents) and transmits state information<br>
obtained in the process to further applications in the<br>
communication network which are connected thereto.<br>
Particularly in the course of the increased use of packet-<br>
switched communication networks (VoIP-networks; VoIP = Voice-<br>
over-Internet-Protcol), increasing use is being made of direct- communication communication networks. These communication<br>
arrangements which are also known as peer-to-peer networks (P2P networks), have the special feature that they operate without a central switching entity (communication system, gatekeeper, or the like). Peer-to-peer networks have primarily become known as what are known as file sharing networks for interchanging files <br><br>
(usually music files or digitized movies) but are also<br>
increasingly used for direct voice communication (telephony,<br>
video telephony, chat etc) . In these peer-to-peer networks, it<br>
is not possible to integrate an ACD system into a switching<br>
entity (communication system, gatekeeper) because either no<br>
central switching entity exists or else an (optionally useable)<br>
central entity is not inevitably used for setting up a<br>
communication link or forwarding an incoming call. Although it<br>
is possible to nominate a communication component - in peer-to-<br>
peer networks these are also called "clients" - as a central<br><br>
contact, that is to say as a call destination, for incoming<br>
calls and to provide this contact with an ACD function, this<br>
conflicts with the peer-to-peer concept because the creation<br>
and compulsory use of such a central entity lose the<br>
flexibility inherent in peer-to-peer networks and the<br>
capability of self-organization. Furthermore, the redundancy<br>
inherent in peer-to-peer networks no longer exists because if<br>
this central entity fails then the ACD function is no longer<br>
present until another entity is administrated as central call<br>
destination and an ACD function is set up in it.<br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention to improve<br>
the forwarding of incoming calls in direct-communication<br>
communication networks and to reduce the administration<br>
complexity for direct-communication communication networks.<br>
The object is achieved for the method by the features of<br>
independent patent claim 1 and for the communication component<br>
by the features of independent patent claim 12.<br>
The solution provides a method for forwarding an incoming call<br>
on a first client to a second in a plurality of further clients<br>
in a direct-communication communication network, in which the second client is selected from the plurality of further<br>
clients, the selection is made by the first client,<br>
the selection is made using property information which is<br>
respectively associated with the further clients and which is available in the first client, and in which the call is forwarded to the selected instances of the further clients. An<br>
advantage of this method is that the function of an ACD system is provided by the "equal-authority" components in a direct- communication communication network, with a central entity not being<br><br>
required and hence the existing functionality being maintained<br>
even if individual entities or clients (communication<br>
components) fail.<br>
The solution also provides a communication component for a<br>
direct-communication communication network, having a forwarding<br>
function for forwarding an incoming call to one of a plurality<br>
of further communication components, where the communication<br>
component has memory means for storing its own property<br>
information and further property information from the further<br>
communication components, is provided with a retrieval device<br>
for retrieving the property information from further<br>
communication components, comprises a detection device for<br>
detecting at least one call property associated with the<br>
incoming call, has a selection device for relating the property<br>
information to the . at least one call property, where the<br>
selection device is set up to select those of the communication<br>
components whose property information has a match with the call<br>
property, and comprises transmission means for transmitting its<br>
own property information to the further communication<br>
components. A communication component of this kind in a direct-<br>
communication communication network may either be a forwarding<br>
entity or form the forwarding destination. Such a communication<br>
component is able to detect the property information from other<br>
communication components and to take it into account for<br>
selecting the forwarding destination, and furthermore also<br>
provides its own property information for the other<br>
communication components in the same communication network. The use of such communication components also allows the function<br>
of an ACD system to be mapped in direct-communication<br>
communication networks without a central entity.<br><br>
The inventive method is advantageously refined further by	the<br>
features of dependent patent claims 2 to 11. The features	and<br>
advantages described therein also apply mutatis mutandis to	the<br>
inventive communication component.<br>
If the further clients respectively provide their associated<br>
property information for retrieval, and before the selection by<br>
the first client, this property information is retrieved from<br>
the further clients, the manual administration of the property<br>
information in each client forwarding a call is dispensed with.<br>
In this case, the step of "retrieval" can be dispensed with if<br>
the further clients automatically transmit their associated<br>
property information to the first client. In this context, the<br>
property information is always present in a current version in<br>
the first client if the property information is repeated under<br>
time control and/or, in the event of a change in the property<br>
information, is transmitted to the first client.<br>
The network load in the communication network can be reduced by<br>
virtue of the property information being transmitted<br>
selectively and only when required. In this regard, the<br>
property information is advantageously retrieved by sending an<br>
interrogation message with at least one search term from the<br>
first client to at least one of the further clients.<br>
The communication network also allows the use of clients which<br>
do not have their own option for storing and transmitting their<br>
own property information. In this regard, advantageously, at<br>
least one of the further clients contains the associated<br>
property information from a plurality of or all further clients;<br>
available for retrieval. Another advantage of this practice is<br>
that the property information from a plurality of clients can<br>
be transmitted collectively, that is to say in a single<br>
transmission step.<br><br>
Errors when forwarding calls are reduced or even prevented by<br>
virtue of the property information having, at least in part, an<br>
associated maximum validity period, and such property<br>
information whose maximum validity period has expired not being<br>
used for selection and/or being retrieved again from the<br>
further clients associated with this property information. In<br>
this context, the "knowledge" required for selection is<br>
distributed over the clients in the communication network, so<br>
that central data management of the property information is not<br>
required.<br>
The destination for forwarding an incoming call can be<br>
determined more precisely by virtue of, for the selection, at<br>
least one call property associated with the incoming call being<br>
evaluated. In this context, the network load for transmitting<br>
property information is reduced further by virtue of the search<br>
term being formed, at least in part, from the call property. Simple and at the same time effective selection of the destination client is possible if a telephone number associated<br>
with the incoming call is used as associated call property.<br>
When calls are repeatedly received from the same caller or in<br>
the same subject area, renewed forwarding to the same<br>
destination client is insured by virtue of the forwarding<br>
involving the at least one call property associated with the<br>
incoming call and information about the selected client<br>
(destination client) being stored, and a subsequent further<br>
incoming call with at least one identical or similar associated<br>
call property involving the use of the stored information to<br>
forward this subsequent call to the same selected client.<br>
When an incoming call arrives at any of the available clients,<br>
it suffices if a client is used either as a first client or as one of the further clients. This furthermore improves the redundancy, because<br><br>
if a first client fails then one of the further clients can be<br>
used as first client.<br>
Exemplary embodiments of the inventive method are explained<br>
below with reference to the drawings and simultaneously serve<br>
as an exemplary embodiment of a communication component based<br>
on the invention.<br>
In the drawings:<br>
figure 1 shows a schematic illustration of a direct-<br>
communication communication network with<br>
communication components, where arrows are used to<br>
show the signaling sent in order to forward an<br>
incoming call,<br>
figure 2 shows a schematic illustration of the call properties<br>
of an incoming call, and<br>
figure 3 shows a schematic illustration of the property<br>
information from a client (communication component).<br>
Figure 1 schematically shows a direct-communication I<br>
communication network P2P (Peer-to-Peer) which contains the clients C1, C2, C3, C4. The clients C1, C2, C3, C4 are formed<br>
by communication components (IP telephone, multimedia PC, PDA, WLAN terminal, smart phone or the like), with client CI being a communication component with a voice mail server functionality (telephone answering machine function), clients C2 and C3 being multimedia PCs (computer with a telephony function), and client C4 being a IP phone (VoIP telephone). In this arrangement, the clients C2, C3 and C4 are associated with the employees at a call center who are associated with different responsibilities and are intended to handle calls from external customers. A further communication component K2, which is likewise arranged in the communication network P2P is not part of the workgroup. The<br><br>
Communication component K1 is shown in figure 1 as a<br>
representative of an unlimited number of external communication<br>
components and, in this exemplary embodiment, represents the<br>
communication terminal of a customer who is calling the hotline<br>
formed by the clients C1, C2, C3 and C4. The arrows shown in<br>
figure 1 symbolize signaling messages S1, S2A, S2B, S2C, S3A,<br>
S3B, S3C, S4 which are interchanged between the communication<br>
components or the clients formed thereby in order to relay a<br>
call.<br>
The text below refers to figure 1 to show the forwarding of a<br>
call which is sent from the communication component K1 to the<br>
client C2 in the direct-communication communication network<br>
P2P. To reach the workgroup which form the "hotline", the<br>
communication component K1 sends a signaling message S1 to a<br>
gateway which connects the communication network P2P to a<br>
public communication network (not shown here). In the<br>
communication network P2P, this gateway function is performed<br>
by the client C2 ("gateway peer"). In this case, the other<br>
clients C1, C3 and C4 may also have such gateway functionality<br>
and hence likewise receive calls from an external communication<br>
network.<br>
The signaling message S1 is evaluated by the client C2, and it<br>
is established that the destination communication address, that<br>
is to say the dialed telephone number, does not identify a specifically stated client in the communication network P2P,<br>
but rather is the "hotline number" of the work group. In addition, the signaling message S1 reveals the "sender's telephone number", that is to say the sender's communication address of the communication terminal K1. This information, which in this case is referred to as call properties, is extracted from the signaling message S1 by a detection device in the client C2, is buffer-stored and is supplied to a selection device in the client C2, which device is intended<br><br>
to select the ultimate call destination, that is to say the<br>
intended client, for a forwarding function.<br>
The call properties transmitted with the signaling message S1 <br>
are shown schematically in figure 2. In this case, the<br>
telephone number +49123 is indicated in a first data field and<br>
the destination telephone number +49456 of the "hotline" is<br>
indicated in a further data field. Advantageously, such a<br>
signaling message S1 also already stores head words regarding<br>
objective contents related to the call. This naturally<br>
presupposes that the communication component K1 can also handle<br>
(e.g. with an input option) and send such head words. Such<br>
objective information regarding contents (known as meta-<br>
information) is then also used by the clients C2 or its<br>
selection device to select a call destination. Alternatively or<br>
in addition, the call may also be initially accepted by the<br>
client C2, with the caller requesting appropriate information,<br>
for example by means of synthetic voice output in an<br>
interactive dialog. Technical facilities for this are often<br>
referred to as "interactive voice response" systems in the<br>
literature.<br>
In the present exemplary embodiment, it is assumed for the purposes of simplification that just the sender's telephone<br>
number +4 9123 of the communication component K1 is used as a call property to decide about the call destination. In many cases, however, it is more advantageous to decide on the basis of subject areas (capabilities, "skills").<br>
The selection device in the client C2 now uses a progress	<br>
memory, which stores information about preceding switching	<br>
processes, to check whether a call with-the sender's telephone	<br>
number +4 9123 has actually been relayed to one of the clients	<br>
C2, C3 and C4 in the past (in this case: within the last two	<br>
weeks) . This is not the case; otherwise, the preferred relaying	<br>
destination (forwarding<br><br>
destination) for this call would be the relevant communication<br>
component (client) which has already been selected beforehand.<br>
In a subsequent, step, the selection device checks whether a<br>
memory in the client C2 contains property information about one<br>
of the clients C2, C3, C4 which correlates to the detected call<br>
properties. Since this is not the case either, the client C2<br>
sends interrogation messages S2A, S2B, S2C to the clients C1,<br>
C3 and C4. The interrogation messages S2A, S2B, S2C can, as in<br>
the present exemplary embodiment, be sent individually to the<br>
clients C1, C3 and C4, whose communication addresses are known<br>
to the client C2. Alternatively, it is also possible to send a<br>
"broadcast message" as an interrogation message, which in this<br>
case would reach all clients or communication component in the<br>
communication network P2P.<br>
As a search term, the interrogation messages S2A, S2B, S2C<br>
comprise the telephone number +49123 of the communication;<br>
component Kl, that is to say a call property of the call which<br>
is to be forwarded. The clients C1 and C3 respond to the<br>
interrogation message with response messages S3A, S3C, which<br>
comprise data records containing property information<br>
("information about oneself). The response message S3A reveals that the communication component uses the client C1 to provide<br>
a voice mail function for calls which cannot or cannot yet be accepted by one of the clients C2, C3, C4. The client C4 which<br>
is formed by a simple IP telephone, is not able to generate a response message for the interrogation message S2B. The client C3 responds with the response message S3C, which comprises two data records. The first' data record EI4 ("property information 4") - not shown here - comprises property information from the client C4. A terminal which is represented by a representative <br>
("proxy") is also referred to as a "virtual peer" in this case.<br><br>
A further data record E13, which is shown schematically in<br>
figure 3, comprises the property information from the client<br>
C3. In this case, the data field C1_N stores the name "Agent 3"<br>
for the client 3. The data field C1_S records the status "BUSY;<br>
65SEC; 30SEC" (that is to say the client C3 has been busy for<br>
65 seconds; this information has a maximum validity of<br>
10 seconds). Hence, while the status represents comparatively<br>
"short-lived" information and therefore has low validity, the<br>
rest of the information has a longer or even - as in this<br>
example - unlimited "life".<br>
The data field C1_C comprises information about the subject<br>
areas C0NTENT_X, CONTENT_Y of the case handler who is using the<br>
appliance Client C3. Finally, the data field C1_H contains a<br>
list of the last "customer contacts" of the client C3, each of<br>
these entries having the telephone number (sender's telephone)<br>
the subject area and the data/time information for the contact<br>
associated with it. The property information from the clients<br>
C1, C3, C4 which is received with the response messages S3A,<br>
S3C is stored by the client C2 as well as its own property;<br>
information - client C2 is not only a "Gateway Peer" but also a<br>
workstation for an employee with similarly associated property<br>
information. In this case, the stored information can also be<br>
evaluated for further, future forwarding operations, provided<br>
that the maximum validities associated with the propertyinformation (elements) have not expired. Equally, the property<br>
information obtained in this manner can also be made available<br>
to clients.<br>
The property information obtained in this manner is then related to the call properties taken from the signaling message <br>
 S1 by the selection device. This involves deciding that client C3 is, on the basis of the past contact with the same customer (entry from data field C1_A), the most suitable forwarding<br>
destination for the incoming<br><br>
call, but cannot accept the call (yet) on account of its "BUSY"<br>
status. Therefore, the call is forwarded to the client C1 <br>
(Voice-Mail-Server) by the forwarding function of client C2<br>
using the signaling message S4, the signaling message S4<br>
comprising, for the voice mail server of the clients C1, the<br>
instruction to pipe waiting music into the associated call and,<br>
after a stipulated waiting time (in this case: 30 seconds; this<br>
corresponds to the validity period for the status information<br>
in the property information EI3) , to return the call to the<br>
client C2 for a fresh relaying attempt. In this context,<br>
meanwhile "expired" property information (in this case: status)<br>
is automatically rerequested by the client C2. Alternatively,<br>
the client C3 may also be set to report status changes<br>
automatically to the client C2, to which property information<br>
has already been transmitted with the signaling message S3C, of<br>
course. The property information may also contain the<br>
information about whether the respective client (at present) is<br>
or is intended to be part of the (or of a particular) ACD group<br>
(Hotline). This is particularly advantageous when the<br>
interrogation message is sent as broadcast message or multicast<br>
message. The ACD group can then be formed "spontaneously"<br>
without manual administration.<br>
The above configuration can be expanded by any number of<br>
clients. Hence, the number of clients with a forwarding<br>
function, that is to say gateway peers with an ACD function,<br>
for example, is also not limited. In this case, it is<br>
fundamental that the resources, that is to say both information<br>
(in this case: the property information) and the switching<br>
entities, are not concentrated on or limited to individual<br>
components (appliances, clients, server, gateway) but rather<br>
are available and can be found "in distributed form" in the<br>
network, which allows even load distribution and a high level<br>
of failsafety (redundancy). In this context, it is possible, in<br>
principle, for any communication component<br><br>
to have both client and server functionalities; these are also<br>
therefore referred to as "Servents".<br><br>
We Claim:<br>

calling party and a second communication address at which the second<br>
clients are associated for identifying of the second clients as being sought for<br>
connection via the incoming call; the first client checking memory in which<br>
information about preceding switching processes is stored to check whether a<br>
call with the first communication address of the calling party has previously<br>
been relayed to one of the second clients within a predetermined amount of<br>
time, upon a determination that one of the second clients previously received<br><br>
a call with the calling party, the first client forwarding the incoming call to<br>
that one of the second clients, and upon a determination that none of the<br>
second clients previously received a call from the calling party relayed to the<br>
second clients within the predetermined amount of time, the first client<br>
sending at least one interrogatory message to the second clients; the second<br>
clients receiving the at least one interrogatory message from the first client<br>
and responding to the at least one interrogatory message, each of the second<br>
clients responding to the at least one interrogatory message by sending a<br>
response message to the first client, the response message comprising<br>
second property information for the second client and status information for<br>
that second client; the first client receiving the response messages and<br>
storing the second property information and status information for the second<br>
clients; and the first client relating the second property information from the<br>
response messages to the first property information of the calling party to<br>
select the second client to which to forward the incoming call.<br>

ABSTRACT<br><br><br>
TITLE: METHOD FOR FORWARDING A CALL IN A DIRECT- COMMUNICATION<br>
COMMUNICATION NETWORK, AND COMMUNICATION COMPONENT FOR<br>
DIRECT-COMMUNICATION COMMUNICATION NETWORK<br>
The invention relates to a method for forwarding an incoming call on a first<br>
client (C2) to a second in a plurality of further clients (C1,<br>
C2, C3, C4) in a direct-communication communication network (P2P). The<br>
second client (C1) is selected from the plurality of further clients (C1, C2,<br>
C3, C4), the selection is made by the first client (C2), the selection is made<br>
using property information (EI3) which is respectively associated with the<br>
further clients (C1, C2, C3, C4) and which is available in the first client (C2),<br>
the call is forwarded to the client selected from the further clients (C1), and<br>
in that: the information required for the selection is distributed over the<br>
clients in the communication network so that central data management of the property information is not required.</td>
