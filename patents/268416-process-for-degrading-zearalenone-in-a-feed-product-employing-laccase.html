FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a method for detoxification of feed products contaminated by the mycotoxin zearalenone.<br><br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Several plant pathogenic and/or post-harvest Fusarium species on cereals produce toxic substances of considerable concern to livestock and poultry producers, e.g., deoxynivalenol, T-2 toxin, HT-2 toxin, diacetoxyscirpenol and zearalenone.<br><br>
Zearalenone is found worldwide in a number of cereal crops, such as maize, barley, oats, wheat, rye, rice, millet and sorghum. Zearalenone production does not seem to occur in significant amounts prior to harvest, but under proper environmental conditions, it is readily produced on corn and small grains in storage.<br><br>
When cereal grain is used in ethanol production and the starch is consumed the zearalenone is concentrated in the fermentation by-products, e.g., in the distiller's dried grain. The contents of zearalenone in the fermentation by-products may be increased three-fold relative to the cereal grain.<br><br>
The toxin is heat-stable, and it is not destroyed by long storage, roasting, or by the addition of propionic acid or mold retardants.<br><br>
Despite their structural dissimilarity to the steriodal estrogens, zearalenone and several of its derivatives possess estrogenic activity. Zearalenone undergoes a folding such that hydroxyl or potential hydroxyl groups become appropriately orientated to facilitate binding to tissue receptors that normally bind estrogens.<br><br>
Zearalenone is the primary toxin causing infertility, abortion or other breeding problems, especially in swine. The symptoms are especially severe in prepubertal gilts including enlarged mammae, swelling of uterus and vulva, and atrophy of the ovaries. In severe cases, prolapse of the vulva and rectum may occur. Boars exhibit enlarged mammae and atrophied testes.<br><br>
Zearalenone is present in the meat from animals feeding on contaminated grain as well as in bread baked from contaminated wheat. While cases of poisoning of humans are rare there is concern about the effect of the long term exposure of humans to such an estrogenic activity.<br><br>
Inactivation of mycotoxins, including zearalenone, using epoxidase or lactonase is disclosed in WO 9612414.<br><br>
There is a need for further methods of detoxification of animal feed products, e.g., such <br>
as fermentation by-products, including distiller's wet and dried grain, contaminated by the mycotoxin zearalenone.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br><br>
The inventors of the present invention have discovered that a mycotoxin in a feed product can be degraded into non-toxic substances by treating the feed product with a laccase. Accordingly, in a first aspect the invention provides a process for degrading a mycotoxin in a feed product which process comprises treating said feed product with a laccase. The mycotoxin is preferably zearalenone.<br><br>
In a second aspect the invention provides a use of a laccase for degrading a mycotoxin.<br><br>
Detailed description of the Invention<br><br>
Zearalenone<br>
In the context of this invention the term "zearalenone" comprises the mycotoxin zearalenone produced from certain Fusarium sp. The IUPAC name is (4S,12E)-15, 17-Dihydroxy-4-methyi-3-oxabicyclo[12.4.0]octadeca-12, 15, 17, 19- tetraene-2, 8-dione. <br><br>
The term "zearalenone" also comprises any derivative of<br>
zearalenone which comprises one or more hydroxyl groups susceptible for modification by a laccase.<br><br>
Animal feed products<br>
The term "animal" includes all animals, including human beings. Examples of animals are cattle, (including but not limited to cows and calves); mono-gastric animals, e.g. pigs or swine (including, but not limited to, piglets, growing pigs, and sows); poultry such as turkeys and chicken (including but not limited to broiler chicks, layers); and fish (including but not limited to salmon).<br><br>
The term "feed" or "feed product" means any compound, preparation, mixture, or composition suitable for, or intended for intake by an animal.<br><br>
The feed product may be a product which apart from an unwanted level of zearalenone is suitable for consumption by an animal. The feed product can also be a product suspected of comprising an unwanted level of zearalenone, and/or a product having an unknown level of zearalenone, including products not comprising a detectable level of zearalenone.<br><br>
Preferably the feed product is a grain based product. Preferably the grain based product comprises cereal(s), e.g., one or more of corn, wheat, barley, rye, rice, sorghum and millet. In one embodiment, the feed product may e.g. be derived solely from cereal(s), and in another embodiment partly from legumes, e.g. from soybean, and partly from cereals. The grain based product may comprise whole or milled grain, e.g., wet or dry milled grain, including grain based product comprising fractions of wet or dry milled grain, e.g., gluten, protein, starch, and/or oil fractions. Also preferred are products comprising by-product from brewing and/or fermentation processes, e.g., spent grains. Spent grains are the by-products from the production of alcoholic beverages and ethanol fuels. Brewers' spent grain (BSG) is the residue of beer making in breweries, which use malted barley as the major raw material. Distiller's' spent grain (DSG) is the product left in distilleries after alcohol is removed by distillation from the fermented grains such as corn, wheat, barley, rice, and rye. Distiller's' spent grain is also known as distiller's grain. Wet distiller's grain (WDG) is dried to produce dried distiller's grain (DDG) which is used primarily as animal feed feed.<br><br>
Laccases<br>
In the context of this invention the term "laccases" include enzymes compri¬sed by the enzyme classification E.G. 1.10.3.2.<br>
Preferred are the below mentioned enzymes, especially recombinant and/or substantially purified enzymes.<br><br>
Preferably, the laccase employed is derived from a strain of Polyporus sp., in particular a strain of Polyporus pinisitus or Polyporus versicolor, or a strain of Myceliophthera sp., e.g. M. thermophiia or a strain of Rhizoctonia sp., in particular a strain of Rhizoctonia praticola or Rhizoctonia solani, or a strain of a Rhus sp., in particular Rhus vemicifera.<br><br>
In specific embodiments of the invention the oxidoreductase is a a Polyporus sp. laccase especially the Polyporus pinisitus laccase (also called Trametes villosa laccase) described in WO 96/00290 or a Myceliophthera sp. laccase especially the Myceliophthera thermophiia laccase described in WO 95/33836.<br><br>
Further, the laccase may be a Scytalidium sp. laccase, such as the S. thenvophilium laccase described in WO 95/33837 or a Pyhcularia sp. laccase, such as the Pyhcularia oryzae laccase which can be purchased from SIGMA under the trade name SIGMA no. L5510, or a Coprinus sp. laccase, such as a C. cinereus laccase, especially a C. cinereus IFO 30116 laccase, or a Rhizoctonia sp. laccase, such as a R. soiani laccase, especially the neutral R. soiani laccase described WO 95/07988 having a pH optimum in the range from 6.0 to 8.5.<br><br>
The laccase may also be derived from a fungus such as Collybia, Fomes, Lentinus, Pleurotus, Aspergillus, Neurospora, Podospora, Phlebia, e.g. P. radiata (WO 92/01046), Coholus sp., e.g. C. hirsitus (JP 2-238885), or Botrytis.<br><br>
In preferred embodiments the laccase is a laccase from Myceliophthora thermophila (MtL) having the amino acid sequence deposited as GENESEQP: AAR88500 and shown herein as SEQ ID N0:1., a laccase from Polyporus pinsitus (PpL) having the amino acid sequence deposited as UNIPROT: Q99044 and shown herein as SEQ ID N0:2, a laccase from Streptomyces coelicolor ScL having the amino acid sequence deposited as SWISSPROT: Q9XAL8 and shown herein as SEQ ID N0:3, or a laccase having an amino acid sequence homologous to any of these sequences.<br><br>
The laccase must be present in the medium to be detoxified in effective amounts. Preferably the laccase is present in concentrations of 0.01-100 mg enzyme protein pr. kg dry matter, preferably 0.1-10 mg enzyme protein pr. kg dry matter, or more preferably 1-5 mg enzyme protein pr. kg dry matter.<br><br>
The mediator<br>
In an embodiment a mediator acting as electron donors for the laccase is used together with the laccase. The mediator should be present in the medium to be detoxified in effective amounts.<br><br>
Various mediators are known; see e.g. W09412620, W09412621, W09501626, W09600179 and W09923887. Mediators therein are hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
Preferred for the invention is a mediator selected from Methylsyringate (MES), Phenothiazine-10-propionicacid (PPT), N-(4-cyanophenyl)acetohydroxamic acid (NCPA), acetosyringone, syringaldehyde, p-coumaric acid, 2,2'-Azinobis(3- ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonate), 1-hydroxybenzotriazole, 2,4-pentanedione, and <br><br>
phenothiazine.<br>
Said mediators are commercially available or can be made by methods known to the art.<br>
The medium<br><br>
In an embodiment the laccase is degrading the zearalenone in a medium comprising the feed product. The medium is preferably aqueous and may be a liquid, a paste or a slurry. To form a suitable medium water may be added to the feed product. The laccase and the mediator may be comprised, either separately or together, in solid or liquid formulations suitable for application to said medium.<br><br>
In a embodiment the laccase is degrading the zearalenone to an extent whereby the content of zearalenone per kg dry matter feed product is reduced to less than 50%, less than 60%, less than 70%, preferably less than 80%, more preferably less than 85%, yet more preferably less than 90%, and most preferably less than 95% of the initial amount.<br><br>
The detoxifixation efficiency of the invention depends on e.g. availability of oxygen, pH, temperature and buffer of the medium. For example, the treatment may take place at a pH-value at which the relative activity of the actual laccase is at least 50, or 60, or 70, or 80 or 90%. Likewise, for example, the treatment may take place at a temperature at which the relative activity of the actual laccase is at least 50, or 60, or 70, or 80 or 90%. The relative activity is calculated relative to the activity at the pH value where the highest activity is observed.<br><br>
Oxygen in the medium<br>
The source of oxygen required by the laccase may be oxygen from the atmosphere or an oxygen precursor for in situ production of oxygen. Oxygen from the atmosphere will usually be present in sufficient quantity. If more O2 is needed, additional oxygen may be added, e.g. as pressurized atmospheric air or as pure pressurized oxygen.<br><br>
pH in the medium<br>
Depending, inter alia, on the characteristics of the laccase and the mediator employed, the pH in the medium employed should normally be in the range of 5-11, preferably in the range 6-10, e.g. 6.5-8.5.<br><br>
Temperature in the medium<br>
Preferably a reaction temperature is applied which is close to the optimum temperature for the laccase. In numerous embodiments of the invention, temperatures in the range of 10-65°C, more preferably 30-50 °C, should be employed.<br><br>
Treatment duration<br>
The duration of treatment depends, inter alia, on the treatment type, the type of item to be treated, the properties of the medium, e.g. temperature and pH and the type and amounts of enzyme and mediator employed.<br><br>
The enzymatic reaction is continued until the desired result is achieved, following which it may or may not be stopped by inactivating the enzyme, e.g., by a heat-treatment step.<br>
For detoxification purposes treatment times in the range of 1 minute to 1 week may be employed. In many cases a treatment time in the range of 6 to 48 hours will be suitable.<br><br>
Identity<br>
The relatedness between two amino acid sequences or between two nucleotide sequences is described by the parameter "identity".<br><br>
For purposes of the present invention, the degree of identity between two amino acid sequences is determined using the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm (Needleman and Wunsch, 1970, J. Mol. Biol. 48: 443-453) as implemented in the Needle program of the EMBOSS package (EMBOSS: The European Molecular Biology Open Software Suite, Rice et al., 2000, Trends in Genetics 16: 276-277), preferably version 3.0.0 or later. The optional parameters used are gap open penalty of 10, gap extension penalty of 0.5, and the EBLOSUM62 (EMBOSS version of BLOSUM62) substitution matrix. The output of Needle labeled "longest identity" (obtained using the -nobrief option) is used as the percent identity and is calculated as follows:<br><br>
(Identical Residues x 100)/(Length of Alignment - Total Number of Gaps in Alignment)<br>
For purposes of the present invention, the degree of identity between two deoxyribonucleotide sequences is determined using the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm (Needleman and Wunsch, 1970, supra) as implemented in the Needle program of the EMBOSS package (EMBOSS: The European Molecular Biology Open Software Suite, Rice etal., 2000, supra), preferably version 3.0.0 or later. The optional parameters used are gap open penalty of 10, gap extension penalty of 0.5, and the EDNAFULL (EMBOSS version of NCBI NUC4.4) substitution matrix. The output of Needle labeled "longest identity" (obtained using the -nobrief option) is used as the percent identity and is calculated as follows;<br><br>
(Identical Deoxyribonucleotides x 100)/(Length of Alignment - Total Number of Gaps in Alignment)<br>
Homologous sequence<br><br>
The term "homologous sequence" is defined as a predicted protein that gives an E value (or expectancy score) of less than 0.001 in a tfasty search (Pearson, W.R., 1999, in Bioinformatics Methods and Protocols, S. Misener and S. A. Krawetz, ed., pp. 185-219) with a specified sequence.<br><br>
The term "homologous sequence" may also be defined as a sequence that has a degree of identity at least 75%, at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 95%, at least 97%, at least 98%, at least 99%, or even 100%, to a specified sequence.<br><br>

Reactions were stored at -20° C until chromatographic analysis.<br><br>
Chromatographic analysis: Samples were centrifugated and the supernatant analysed for zearalenone by HPLC-DAD as described by Smedsgaard (J. Chromatogr A, 1997, 760, 264-270). The DAD scanned from 200-600 nm. Separation was done on a Phenomenex (Torrance, OA) Luna CI8(2) 10x2 mm ID, 3 micrometer, column 2, using a linear gradient moving form 5% to 100% acetonitrile in 20 min. Residual zearalenone was calculated relative to the control. The results are presented in tables 1 and 2.<br><br>
