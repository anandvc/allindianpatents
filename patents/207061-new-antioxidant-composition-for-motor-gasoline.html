Section 10<br>
New Antioxidant Composition For Motor Gasoline.<br>
Indian Oil Corporation Limited, an Indian company, of G-9, Ali Yavar Jung Marg) Batidra (East)^ Mumbai-400 051, Maharashtra^ India.<br>
The following specification particularly describes and ascertains the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br>
FORM<br><br>
NEW ANTIOXIDANT COMPOSITION FOR MOTOR GASOLINE<br>
This invention relates to the development of new antioxidant composition for use in motor gasoline fuel.<br>
Motor gasoline fuel when stored for prolonged period of time eventually deteriorates due to oxidation and polymerization. Cracked streams, increasingly being used in gasoline fuel, are worsening the problem. The deterioration of fuel is evidenced by the formation of gums and darkening of color. The gum formation in the fuel system further leads to filter blockage resulting in reduction in fuel flow in engine systems.<br>
In general, the process of fuel degradation is very complex in view of a variety of complex hydrocarbons involved in it. It involves free radical reactions, which are characterized by three distinct stages, viz. initiation, propagation and termination. These reactions are very complex and have implications on the quality of fuel.<br>
Unsaturated compounds such as olefins &amp;dienes contribute to instability by auto-oxidation and/or polymerization reactions in presence of oxygen. Higher levels of unsaturated compounds in the fuels are due to increased severity of secondary refining operations in Fluid Catalytic Cracking (FCQ as well as renewed blending of streams from thermal processes such as Viscosity Breaker (VB) and Coker. These products are used for blending gasoline fuel in order to meet the growing market demand.<br>
Furthermore, only olefins &amp; dienes are not responsible for instability of fuels. In deeply hydrotreated or reformed fuels, most of the natural antioxidants get removed during the process leading to poor stability of the product. If even trace amount of copper is present in the fuel, it shall accelerate the rapid formation of peroxides. The peroxides thus formed shall attack the copper parts of fuel system with the result copper dissolution takes place leading to even more peroxide formation resulting into accelerated oxidation of fuel. Frequent source of copper contamination are copper-containing alloys in refinery equipment, product distribution systems, chemicals used in the refining and the fuel system of vehicles. The catalytic effect of copper is so strong that even the most effective antioxidants/stabilizers cannot provide adequate stability thus causing deterioration of the product.<br>
The options available with the refiners for improving gasoline fuel quality are limited. Following four main routes are usually practiced at the refineries the world over for improving gasoline fuel quality:<br>
•   Selective blending of refinery streams,<br>
l<br><br>
•    6269(P-12)<br>
•	Use of chemical additives,<br>
•	Adopting appropriate processing route, which include, aromatic extraction, hydrogenation and hydro-cracking,<br>
•	Use of chemical additives in combination with processing<br>
Aromatic extraction and hydro-cracking options result in significant changes in product yield whereas hydrogenation has only marginal impact on product balances. The problem of gasoline stability can effectively be solved by the incorporation of carefully selected chemical additives in proper concentrations. These chemical additives primarily retard the natural degradation of gasoline fuel during long-term storage.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Alkyl or aryl substituted hindered phenols are commonly used for stabilisation of gasoline fuel. The stearic hindrance in the hindered phenols is provided by bulky substituents in ortho position to hydroxyl group in the ring of the phenolic antioxidant. These bulky subsituents influence the specificity of the phenols by blocking phenoxyl radicals from abstracting hydrogen atoms from organic substrates. 2,6-Di-t-butylphenol(DTBP) is most widely used functional group in commercial hindered phenolic antioxidants. This group is effective and easily made at moderate cost by the ortho alkylation of phenol by olefins using ortho selective catalyst. Preparation of nitroalkane based hindered phenols and their antioxidant properties are reported in British Patent No. 1,561,311.<br>
European Patent No. EP 106,799 assigned to M/s Sanodz GmbH reported a<br>
mixture of sterically hindered phenols having recrystalisation temperature 
deg.G These types of compounds are reported to be useful antioxidants for liquid<br>
fuels, especially the gasoline. Canadian Patent CA 1,216,308 assigned to M/s Ethyl<br>
Corporation reported p-alkylenes hindered phenols as useful antioxidants for<br>
gasoline, lubricating oils, plastics, rubbers etc. US Patent 4,981,495 reported that<br>
the oxidation stability of gasoline mixture is improved by adding to the gasoline<br>
1-10,000 ppm of an alkyl-1,2-dihydoquinoline compounds, dimer, trimer or<br>
polymers. Optionally a hindered phenol may be jointly used with the quinoline<br>
compounds. Halon and Vincent have reported in European Patent EP 427,456<br>
that liquid mixture of alkyl phenols composed of 2-t-butylphenol and 2,6-di-t-<br>
butylpheno are suitable for use as stabilisers for middle distillate fuels, fuel oils etc.<br>
European Patent EP 410,577 discusses polymeric reaction products of an ortho<br>
substituted phenol as antioxidant for liquid hydrocarbon such as kerosene and<br>
gasoline. German Patent No. 2,917,927 describes that alkylated dihydroxybiphenyl<br>
are useful as antioxidants and can help in the improvement in induction period.<br>
Japanese Patent No. 81,92,235 reported that malkyl-tris(3,5-dialkyl-4-<br>
hydroxyberrzyl) benzene	and	1,2,4- trimethyi- 3,5,6- tris (3,5- diisopropyl)- 4-<br>
2<br><br><br>
hydroxybenzyl)benzene as stabiliser for rubbers, gasoline etc. However, the disadvantage associated with using phenolic antioxidant alone includes high treat levels, inability to effectively control peroxides formed during the oxidation process and their inability to check colour degradation of fuels.<br>
Aromatic amines are well known as antioxidants for a long time but the mechanism of their action is not well established compared to the phenolic antioxidants. Basically some of the aromatic amines are of quite complex compositions and a number of oxidation products are obtained from the reaction of aromatic amines and fuel degradation products. Aromatic amines commonly being used are phenylenediamines and diarylamines. However, several synergistic combinations are also documented in literature.<br>
US Patent No. 4,279,621 reported that heavy polyamines distillation residues can be used as antioxidants for gasolines at a treat level of 0.05 wt%. Japanese patent Jpn Kokai Tokkyo Koho JP 58,76,492 assigned to M/s Sumitomo Chemical Co. Ltd. reported mixture of a 2-tert-butyl alkyl phenol, bis(nonyl phenol) amine and ditridecylthiodipropionate as antioxidants for gasoline, kerosene, light oils and heavy oils. US Patent No. 4,456,541 assigned to Ethyl Corporation reports that the addition of 3,5-diethyltolune-2,4-diamine or 3,5-diethykolune-2,6-diamine or their mixture in appropriate concentration provides antioxidant properties to polymers, gasoline, lube oils and other organic compounds.<br>
US Patent No. 4,871,374 assigned to Weers of Petrolite Corp. reported that a fuel oil can be stabilized with an inline-enamine condensate. Additive is claimed to be effective in improving the colour stability, sedimentation of distillate oils. US Patent No. 4,647,290 reports that the colour deterioration of a distillate fuel oil is inhibited by adding a mixture of N-(2 - aminoethyl) piperazine and HONEt2. A straight -run gasoline fuel containing 200 ppm of N-(2 - aminoethyl) piperazine and 300 ppm of HONEt2 was placed in an oven at 140 deg.F for 14 days, cooled, and filtered; the ASTM colour of the filtrate was 2.5 (ASTM D-1500), compared with 5.0 for the gasoline fuel containing only N-(2 - aminoethyl) piperazine. US Patent No. 5,197,996 reports that boron based additive helps in the colour stabilisation of distillate fuel oil. US Patent No. 5,035,719 describes that storage stability of middle distillate fuels is improved by adding an acrylate polymer containing moieties derived from 4-vinylpyridine or the enamine ester of morpholine etc. and propionaldehyde as additive. US Patent No. 4,978,366 reported that distillate fuel especially which has a high acid number initially or which develops a high acid number as result of fuel degradation, is stabilized with a diaminomethane. Henry and West have reported in US Patent No. 5,011,504 that block copolymers of acrylic and acrylic amines can be used as additives for fuel oils to diminish sediment and colour formulation. A suitable additive as reported by them is 2-emylhexylmethacrylate-dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate copolymer. US Patent No. 5,057,123 describes that diesel fuel at high temperature<br>
3<br><br>
6269(P-12)<br>
can be stabilized with an amine-containing copolymer selected from aminopropyl morpholine ethylene- propylene- hexadiene copolymer N- phenylenediamine ethylene- propylene-hexadiene copolymer and N-aminopropyl- N phenylenediamine ethylene- propylene- hexadiene copolymer. Though amine based antioxidants are excellent oxidation inhibitors for gasoline and other middle distillate fuels, but they are cosdy and their use in fuels adversely affects the economics of oil refineries.<br>
Cashew Nut Shell Liquid (popularly known as CNSL) is obtained after the hydrogenation of naturally occurring, biodegradable, vegetable based Cashew Nut Shell Liquid. CNSL occurs as a reddish brown viscous liquid in the soft honeycomb structure of the shell of cashewnut. CNSL, extracted with low boiling petroleum ether, contains about 90% anacardic acid and about 10% cardol. CNSL, on distillation, gives the pale yellow phenolic derivatives, which are a mixture of biodegradable unsaturated m-alkylphenols, including cardanol. Catalytic hydrogenation of these phenols gives a white waxy material, predominantly rich in tetrahydroanacardol, which is also known as hydrogenated CNSL. CNSL and its derivatives have been known for producing high temperature phenolic resins and friction elements, as exemplified in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,395,498 and 5,218,038. Friction lining production from CNSL is also reported in U.S. Pat. No. 5,433,774. Likewise, it is also known to form different types of friction materials, mainly for use in brake lining system of automobiles and coating resins from CNSL.<br>
Mannich condensation products are rarely reported as antioxidants for gasoline. However, they are known to act as dispersants and detergents in various types of hydrocarbon stocks. Use in lighter hydrocarbon stocks, such as gasolines, has been disclosed in US. Pat. Nos. 3,269,810 and 3,649,229. U.S. Pat. No. 3,235,484 (Now U.S. Pat. No. Re. 26,330) which describes the addition of certain disclosed compositions to refinery hydrocarbon fuel stocks for the purpose of inhibiting the accumulation of carbonaceous deposits in refinery cracking units.<br>
Several distinct disadvantages are associated with using phenolic antioxidants alone. Such disadvantages include high treat levels, inability to effectively control peroxides formed during the oxidation process and their inability to check colour degradation of fuels.<br>
The disadvantage associated with using amine based antioxidants alone is the considerable costs of such compounds that affects the refinery economics and their tendency to impart colour to gasoline, as some of the amine based antioxidants are pretty dark in colour.<br>
The disadvantage associated with using only Mannich bases is their poor antioxidant efficacy for gasoline fuel, when used singularly.<br>
4<br><br>
6269(P-12)<br>
Therefore, an object of this invention is to propose a new gasoline antioxidant composition, which obviates the above referred disadvantages.<br>
Another object of this invention is to propose a new gasoline antioxidant composition, which can effectively control the gum formation during storage and use.<br>
A further object of this invention is to propose a new gasoline antioxidant composition, which can effectively control the colour degradation of gasoline.<br>
A still further object of this invention is to propose a new gasoline antioxidant composition with improved antioxidant characteristics.<br>
Another object of this invention is to propose a new gasoline antioxidant composition, which when used in gasoline can reduce copper corrosion and pitting tendency up to the desired level.<br>
Yet further object of this invention is to propose a new gasoline antioxidant composition, which when used in fuels can help in controlling water emulsification up to the desired extent.<br>
Another object of this invention is to propose a new gasoline antioxidant composition, which does not require use of costly metal deactivator in wide variety of gasoline fuel.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It has now been established through this invention that when Mannich base is incorporated in combination with an amine based antioxidant into the gasoline fuel containing cracked components obtained from various secondary processing units (viz. FCC, VB and Coker, etc.), the oxidation of fuel, sediment formation, corrosion inhibition and water uptake tendencies are improved appreciably in comparison to when any of the aforesaid components is added singularly to the fuel.<br>
For example, if amine based antioxidant was used alone then potential gum level was reduced from base value of 132 g/m3 - 258 g/m3 to around 32 g/m3 - 38 g/m3 in gasoline fuel at 20 mg/lit to 50mg/lit as per ASTM D- 873 / IP: 138 (Modified). While at the same dosages level and at higher levels of Mannich Base alone, the potential gum level could not be brought down to the desired level of less than 50 g/m3. However, in the case of a combination of Mannich base and an amine- based antioxidant, the potential gum level in the gasoline fuel was reduced to around 28 g/m3 as compared to 258 g/m3 potential gum value of the base gasoline fuel.<br>

6269(P-12)<br>
A successful attempt has been made to develop an antioxidant formulation using synergistic combination of amine based antioxidant and Mannich bases derived from commercially available p-substituted phenols and from Cashew Nut Shell Liquid (CSNL).<br>
The amine based antioxidant of the present invention belong to N,N-Alkyl-butyl-paraphenylenediamine chemistry.<br>
The alkyl phenols used in the process of preparation of Mannich bases are para-nonyl phenol or para-dodecyl phenol or hydrogenated and distilled Cashew Nut Shell Liquid (popularly known as CNSL). CNSL, on distillation, gives the pale yellow phenolic derivatives, which are a mixture of biodegradable unsaturated m-alkylphenols, including cardanol. Catalytic hydrogenation of these phenols gives a white waxy material, predominantly rich in tetrahydroanacardol, which is also known as hydrogenated CNSL. Mannich condensation products were prepared by the reaction of para-nonyl phenol or para-dodecyl phenol or the hydrogenated CNSL( hydrogenation of cashew nut shell liquid was carried out in an autoclave using conventional method of catalytic hydrogenation), an amine having at least one reactive hydrogen atom, and an aldehyde in the molar ratio of I:0.1tol0:0.1tol0 at a temperature ranging from 70 °C - 175 °C for 6 to 12 hours in presence of a protic organic solvent.<br>
The Mannich base present in the Antioxidant compositions varies from 50.0 to 95% by weight, whereas the amine based component is in the range of 50% to 5% by weight. The overall nitrogen content of the synergistic compositions used in the present invention may varyfrom 3.5 wt% to 8.5 wt%.<br>
The composition of the present invention has a synergistic effect. Further object and advantages of this invention will be more apparent from the ensuing examples. It is being understood that such examples are not intended to limit the scope of the present invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRITION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Evaluation Methodology<br>
A correlation programme was done to compare various test methods used for assessing antioxidant performance of gasoline antioxidants. In view that Potential Gum was found to be quite stringent test for assessing the antioxidant performance of gasoline, the Potential Gum Test as per ASTM D- 873 / IP: 138 (Modified) was selected as the test for evaluating the performance of the various individual components and in formulated packages used in this invention. Selected short listed, final compositions were additionally evaluated for Existent Gum as per ASTM D-381<br>
6<br><br>
6269(P-12)<br>
/ IP: 131, Induction Period test as per ASTM D- 525 / IP: 40 and Ambient Aging test for three months. The details of various test used for assessing the antioxidant characteristics in the present invention are given below:<br>
1.	POTENTIAL GUM: A measured quantity of fuel (50 ml) is oxidized under prescribed condition in a Bomb for 4 hrs at 100 deg. C after pressurizing it with 100 psi oxygen pressure. The aged product is subjected to Residue on Evaporation test. The adhered gums are included after washing the sample container with gum solvent and residue is washed with heptane also . Results are reported as gm/m3- The maximum allowable limit for gums by this method is 50 gm/m3.<br>
2.	EXISTENT GUM: A measured quantity of fuel (50 ml) is evaporated under controlled conditions of temperature and flow of air. The resulting residue is weighed and reported as gm/m3. For motor gasoline, the residue is weighed before and after washining with n-heptane and the result reported as gm/m3. The maximum allowable limit for gums by this method is 40 gm/m3.<br>
3.	INDUCTION PERIOD: A measured quantity of fuel (50 ml) is oxidized under prescribed condition in a Bomb Initially filled at 15 to 25 deg. C with oxygen pressure at 100 psi and heated at a temperature between 98 to 102 deg. G The pressure is read at stated intervals or recorded continuously until the brake point is reached. The time required for the sample to reach this point is observed and reported as induction period. The maximum allowable limit by this method is 360 minutes.<br>
4.	AMBIENT   AGING   FOR   THREE   MONTHS:   400   ml   of<br>
antioxidant doped gasoline sample is kept in 500 ml capacity borosilicate glass botdes for three months at ambient temperatures in triplicate. After completion of the first, second and third months one set is subjected to Existent Gum Test as per ASTM D-381 and the result reported as gm/m3. Colour of the fuel is also noted after completion of each month.<br>
The   short   listed   composition   was    additionally   tested   for   following characteristics:<br>
1. WATER REACTION OF FUELS: This test is designed to measure water tolerance characteristics of gasoline. It is a quick way to measure the ability of a fuel to separate rapidly from water after mixing under low shear conditions. Briefly the procedure involves hand shaking of 80<br>
7<br><br>
6269(P-12)<br>
ml of fuel with 20 ml of phosphate buffer solution for two minutes. After a 5 minutes settling period, the fuel water interface and water layer are rated for emulsion, the fuel phase and clarity.<br>
2. DYNAMIC CORROSION TEST: This test is carried out to evaluate the ability of fuels to prevent rusting of ferrous parts when fuel comes in contact with water. Corrosion can lead to severe problems in storage tanks, pipelines tankers and automobile fuel tanks. The particles of rust can also clog fuel lines, filters carburetor orifices or jets. This evaluation procedure is based upon ASTM D-665-95 standard test method for mineral oils with modification so that the test is run at ambient temperature for fuels. 300 ml of the fuel is stirred at lOOOi 50 rpm with 30 ml of distilled water for 24 hrs using polished steel spindle conforming to grade 1018 of ASTM A-108 specifications.<br>
Experimental Details<br>
In order to evaluate the performance of the various components, e.g. phenolic antioxidants, amine based antioxidants or Mannich base, a comprehensive evaluation program was prepared. The evaluation program includes three important variables such as selection of components, optimization of their treat rate and the selection of base gasoline composition. Composition of the base gasoline was kept constant during the evaluation of the selected component for the development of optimized formulation. In order to verify the results, few selected components were also evaluated in different gasoline compositions. The final antioxidant compositions were evaluated in different gasoline compositions being produced by the Indian refineries. The components were initially evaluated at low treat rate and depending on the response, evaluation was done at higher or lower treat rates. The final composition was up-scaled in a chemical pilot plant and tested on a large scale in one of the Indian refineries. The gasoline compositions used for the study are given as follows:<br><br>

Large Scale Trail of Antioxidant Composition - 7<br>
The Antioxidant Composition - 7 was tested at large scale in one of the Indian Oil Refineries. Antioxidant Composition - 7 was prepared in bulk and transported to the refinery in HDPE drums. Initially the composition was tested in the refinery laboratory. Laboratory blend of gasoline containing FCC stream was prepared in consultation with Technical Department with the refinery. The composition of gasoline used for evaluation work is as follows:<br><br>
Streams	% Volume<br>
FCC Gasoline of Refinery- A	55<br>
Reformate Stream of Refinery- A	35<br>
K7TOP Stream of Refinery- A	10<br>
The Antioxidant Composition - 7 along with the Commercial Antioxidant (N,N'-Disecondry-butyl-paraphenylenediamine) already in use at the refinery7 were tested for Potential Gum Test as per ASTM D- 873 / IP: 138 (Modified). The laboratory evaluation data revealed that Antioxidant Composition - 7 is quite effective even at 10 mg/lit treat level compared to the Commercial Antioxidant (N,N'-Disecondry-butyl-paraphenylenediamine). Results are summarised as follows:<br><br>
Antioxidant	Treat Rate, mg/Lit	Potential Gum,<br>
-	-	158<br>
Commercial Amine AO	10	44<br>
Commercial Amine AO	20	38<br>
Antioxidant Composition - 7	10	26<br>
Antioxidant Composition - 7	20	20<br>
As a sequel to laboratory testing, the Antioxidant Composition - 7 was added in two tanks (about 7300KL) at a treat rate of lOmg/lit, which is 50% lower than the<br>
