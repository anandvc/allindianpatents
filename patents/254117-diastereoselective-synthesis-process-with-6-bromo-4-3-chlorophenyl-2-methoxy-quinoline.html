				<td>DIASTEREOSELECTIVE SYNTHESIS PROCESS WITH 6-BROMO-4-(3-CHLOROPHENYL)-2-METHOXY-QUINOLINE<br>
The present invention relates to the diastereoselective synthesis process of 5-substituted imidazole compounds which have farnesyl tranferase inhibitory activity and to compounds used in the synthesis process for said imidazole compounds.<br>
Famesyltransferase inhibitors block the main post-translational modification of the Ras protein, thus interfering with its localization to die inner surface of the plasma membrane and subsequent activation of the downstream effectors. Although initially developed as a strategy to target Ras in cancer, famesyltransferase inhibitors have subsequently been acknowledged as acting by additional and more complex mechanisms that may extend beyond Ras involving GTP-binding proteins, kinases, centromere-binding proteins and probably other farnesylated proteins.<br>
A particular farncsyltransferase inhibitor is described in WO 97/21701, namely (R)-(+)-6-[amino(4-chlorophenyl}(l-niethyl-lJfir-imidazol-5-yl)methyl]-4-(3-chlorophenyl)-l-methyl^U/O-quinolinone. The absolute stereochemical configuration of the compound was not determined in the experiments described in the above-mentioned patent specification, but the compound was identified by the prefix "(B)" to indicate that it was the second compound isolated from column chromatography. The compound thus obtained has been found to have the (R)-(+)-configuration. This compound will be referred to below by its published code number Rl 15777 and has the following formula (V).<br>

R115777 (Tipifamib) is a potent, orally active inhibitor of farnesylprotein transferase. It is one of the most advanced of the farnesylprotein transferase inhibitors currently reported to be in clinical development, being one of the agents that have progressed to phase ffl studies.<br><br>
Rl 15777 has been found to have very potent activity against neoplastic diseases.<br>
Antineoplastic activity in solid tumors, such as breast cancer, as well as in haematological malignancies, such as leukemia, have been observed. Also combination studies have been carried out demonstrating that R115777 can be safely combined with several highly active anticancer drugs.<br>
In WO 01/53289, theracemates (±) (4-(3-chloro-phenyl)-6-[(6-chloro-pyridin-3-yl)-(4-methoxy-benzylamino)-(3-inethy]-3Jy-imidazol-4-yl}-methyl]-l-cycIopropylmethyl-lH-quinolin-2-one (racemate 1) and (±) 4-(3-chloro-phenyl)-6-[(6-chloro-pyridin-3-yl)-[(4-methoxy-benzylidene)-amino]-(3-methyl-3H-imida2ol-4-yl)-methyl]-l-cyclopropylmethyl-lflr-quinolin-2-one (racemate 2) are prepared.<br>

After chiral molecule separation using column chromatography, either the benzylamino or the benzilidine moiety of the resulting (+) and /or (-) enantiomers are converted to an amino group under acidic conditions.<br>
In WO 97/21701, it is described (on page 9, line 7-14) that intermediates of formula (XIII), can be prepared by reacting an intermediate of formula (XIV), wherein W is an appropriate leaving group, such as, for example, halo, with an intermediate ketone of formula (XV). In WO 97/21701, it is described that this reaction can be performed by converting the intermediate of formula (XV) into an organometallic compound, by stirring it with a strong base such as butyl lithium and subsequently adding the intermediate ketone of formula (XV). It is further indicated that although this reaction gives at first instance a hydroxy derivative (i.e. R8 is hydroxy), said hydroxy derivative can be converted into other intermediates wherein R8 has another definition by performing art-known (functional group) transformations. The drawings of the<br><br>
compounds of formula (XDI), (XV) and (XIV) have been taken over from WO 97/21701 and the substituents in these drawings are as defined in WO 97/21701.<br>

In WO 97/21701, it is also described (from page 7 line 32, to page 8 line 6) that the compounds of formula (XVI), wherein R is Ci^alkyl, R(2"8' I6"19) can be a substituent chosen from lists as defined in WO 97/21701 and R1 has a meaning as defined in WO 97/21701 apart from hydrogen, may be prepared by hydrolysing an intermediate ether of formula (XIII), according to art-known methods, such as stirring the intermediate of formula (XIII) in an aqueous acid solution. An appropriate acid can be for instance hydrochloric acid. Subsequently the resulting quinolinone, wherein R1 is hydrogen, may be transformed into a quinolinone of formula (XVI) by art-known W-alkylation. The drawings of the compounds of formula (XIII) and (XVI) have been taken over from WO 97/21701 and the substituents in these drawings are as defined in WO 97/21701.<br>

The synthesis of Rl 15777 as originally described in WO 97/21701, is presented in scheme 1.<br>
Herein, in step 1, the intermediate 1-methyl imidazole in tetrahydrofuran, is mixed with a solution of n-butyllithium in a hexane solvent to which is added chlorotriethylsilane<br>
(triethylsilyl chloride), followed by a further addition of n-butyllithium in nexane, the resulting mixture being cooled to -78°C before the addition of a solution of a compound of formula (I), i.e. 6-(4-chlorobenzoyI)-4-(3-chloropheny])-l-methyl-2(l#)-quinolinone in tetrahydrofuran. The reaction mixture is subsequently brought to room temperature, and then hydrolysed, extracted with ethyl acetate and the organic layer worked up to obtain a compound of formula (H), i.e. (±)-6-[hydroxy(4-chlorophenyl) (l-methyl-lflr-imidazol-5-yl)methy]]-4-(3-chlorophenyl)-J-methyl-2(lH)-quinolinone.<br>
In step 2, the hydroxy compound of formula (U) is chlorinated with thionylchloride to form a compound of formula (HI), i.e. (±)-6-[chloro(4-chlorophenyl)(l -methyl- IH-<br>
In step 3, the chloro compound of formula (HI) is treated, with NKUOH in tetrahydrofuran to form the amino compound of formula (IV), i.e. (±)-6-[amino(4-chlorophenyl)(l-methyl-lH-imidazol-5-yl)rnethyl]-4-(3-chlorophenyl)-l-methyI-2(lH)-quinoIinone.<br>
In step 4, the amino compound of formula (IV) is separated into its enantiomers by chiral column chromatography over Chiracel OD (25 cm; eluent: 100% ethanol; flow: 0.5 ml/min; wavelength: 220 nm). The pure (B)-fractions are collected and recrystallised from 2-propanol resulting in Rl 157*77, the compound of formula (V).<br>

Scheme 1<br>
However, the procedure described in WO97/21701 has a number of disadvantages. For example, during the first step, the procedure results in the undesired formation of a corresponding compound of formula (XI), i.e. 6-[hydroxy(4-chlorophenyl) (1-methyl-ljff-imidazol-2-yl)methyl]-4-(3-chloropheny])-l-methyl-2(lH)-quinolinone), in which the hnidazole ring is attached to the remainder of the molecule at the 2-position of the ring, instead of the desired 5-position. At the end of the procedure, this results in the formation of a compound of formula (XII), i.e.6-[amino(4-chloropheny])(l-methyl-l/f-imidazol-2-yl)methyl]-4-(3-chlorophenyl)-l-methyl-2(lfl)-quinolinone.<br><br>
(Figurer Remove)<br><br><br>
(XI)<br><br>
Furthermore, the purification of compound (V) using chiral chromatography is expensive and disadvantageous in view of the large amounts of solvent needed and the specialised equipment required to perform a targe scale chiral chromatography.<br>
Another process for the synthesis of Rl 15777 as described in WO 02/072574, is presented in scheme 2.<br>
Herein, in step 1, 1-methyi imidazole in tetrahydrofuran is mixed with a solution of n-hexyllithium in a hexane solvent to which is added tri-iso-butylsilyl chloride, followed by a further addition of n-hexyllithium in hexane. The compound of formula (I) in tetrahydrofuran is then added to the reaction mixture, keeping the temperature between -5°C and 0°C. The resulting product of formula (n) is isolated by salt formation.<br>
In step 2, the chlorination reaction is effected by treatment of the compound of formula (H) with thionyl chloride in l,3-dimethyl-2-imidazolidinone.<br>
In step 3, the chloro compound of formula (ID) is treated with a solution of ammonia in methanol. After the addition of water, the compound of formula (IV), precipitates and can be isolated.<br>
In step 4, the compound of formula (IV) can be reacted with L-(-)-dibenzoyl tartaric acid (DBTA) to form the diastereomeric tartrate salt with formula (VI) i.e. R-(-)-6-[amino(4-chlorophenyl)(l-methyl-lff-irnidazol-5-yl)methyl]-4-(3-chlorophenyl)-l-methyl-2(lH)-quinolinone[R-(R*,R*)]-2,3-bis(benzoyloxy)butanedioate(2:3).<br>
Finally, in step 5, the compound of formula (VI) is treated with aqueous ammonium hydroxide, to form the crude compound of formula (V) which is then purified by recrystallisation from ethanol to the pure compound (V).<br><br><br>
(Figurer Remove)<br><br><br>
However, in view of the fact that water is present during the third and the fifth step of this procedure, there is significant formation of the hydroxy compound of formula (II). This is important because the compounds of formula (II) and (V) are difficult to separate. In order to keep the quality of the final product (V) as high as possible, it is critical to limit the formation of compound (E).<br>
The, major drawback of the above described processes is the generation of large amounts of the other enantiomer that subsequently must be recycled.<br>
Attempts were made to develop processes that solve this problem. One of the possibilities was to enter chirality in the first step of the procedure. A first study was carried out in order to determine if the conversion of an enantiomer of the hydroxy compound of formula (II) into a compound of formula (IV) could preserve chirality.<br>
Several experimental conditions have been tested starting with an enantiomer of a compound of formula (IF), but racemisation aJways occurred,<br>
Shaw et al (Tetrahedron Letters: 42, 7173-7176) already in 2001, disclosed an asymmetric synthesis process for the production of a-ary]-cc~heteroaryl alkylamines using organometallic additions to Af-tert-butanesulfiny] ketimines. However, the configuration and the yield of the final enantiomer formed with this process, was depending on the configuration of the W-tert-butanesuIfinyl moiety of the ketimines, the composition of the aryl and/or the heteroaryl moieties of the ketimines, as well as on the organo- and the metallic moiety of the organometallic reagent. Furthermore, the use of heteroaryllithium reagents were described in this document, as being in particular disadvantageous, in view of their instability.<br>
Nevertheless, it was tried to put together an N--C|^alkyl-(S*)-sulfinylketimine containing one part of the molecule of a compound of formula (VI) with an heteroaryllithium compound containing the rest of the molecule in such a way that the resulting W-Ci.6alkyl-(S*)-sulfinylamine could be used for conversion into a compound of formula (IV).<br>
One approach was to diverge from the classical synthesis scheme of Rl 15777 and try to enter the 4-phenyIquinolinone backbone onto a #-Ci-6aIkyl-(S*)-sulfmylketirnine prepared from (4-chlorophenyl)(l-methyl-lH-imidazol-5-yl)methanone. Trial and error learned that the 4-phenylquinolinone backbone can not be directly introduced, that it is preferable to perform a bromine-lithium exchange on a 6-bromo-4-(3-chlorophenyl)-2-methoxy-quinoline and that in contrast to the procedure described by Shaw et al., the JV-C].6alky]-(S*)-sulfinylketimine prepared from (4-ch]orophenyl)(l-methyl-lH-imidazol-5-yl)methanone should be added to the organolithium compound and not vice versa.<br>
Thus the present invention solves the above described problems. It provides a new process for the preparation of a compound of formula (IV), without the need to recycle one of the enantiomers, while minimising the formation of undesired isomers and impurities and under conditions which offer economic advantages for operation on a commercial scale.<br>
