Pharmaceutical Use and .Assay<br>
Compounds of formulae (I) and (II) and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, hereinafter referred to alternatively as "agents of the invention", are useful as Pharmaceuticals. In particular, the compounds have good CRTh2 receptor antagonist activity and may be tested in the following assays.<br>
Filtration binding .assay, protocol<br>
The binding of CRTh2 antagonists is determined using membranes prepared from human CRTh2-express!ng Chinese Hamster Ovary cells (CHO.K1-CRTh2). To produce cell membranes CHO.K1-CRTh2 cells cultured in roller bottles are harvested using cell dissociation buffer (Invitrogen). The cells are pelleted by centrifugation (167 g, 5 min). The cell pellet is incubated in hypotonlc buffer (15 mM Tris-OH, 2 rnM MgCI2, 0.3 mM EDTA, 1 mM EQTA, 1x Complete™ tablet) at 4°C for 30 min. At 4°C cells are homogenized using a Polytron® (IKA Ultra Turrax T25) for 5 bursts of 1 second. The homogenate is centrifuged<br><br>
(Beckman Optima TM TL Ultracentrifuge, 48000 g, 30 min at 4°C). The supernatant is discarded and the membrane pellet resuspended in homogenisation buffer (75 mM Tris-OH, 12.5 mM MgCl2, 0.3 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 250 mM Sucrose, 1x Complete™ tablet. Membrane preparations are aliquoted and stored at 80°C. The protein content is estimated using Bradford Protein Assay Dye (Bio Rad).<br>
The binding of [3H]-PGD2 (157 Ci/mmol) to CHO.K1-CRTh2 membranes is determined in the absence (total binding) and presence (non-specific binding) of unlabelled PGD2 (1 jiM). Subtraction of the cpm (counts per minute) of [3H]-PGD2 binding in presence of excess unlabelled PGD2 from that observed in the absence of excess unlabelled PGDZ is defined as specific binding. Active CRTh2 antagonists are able to compete with [3H]-PGD2 for binding to the CRTh2 receptor and are identified in a decrease in the number of cpm bound.<br>
The assay is performed in Greiner U-bottomed 96 well-plates, in a final volume of 100 |4.l per well. CHO.K1-CRTb2 membranes were diluted in assay buffer (10mM HEPES-KOH (pH 7.4), 1 mM EDTA and 10 mM MnCI2) and 10 ^g are added to each well. [3H]-PGD2 is diluted in assay buffer and added to each well at a final concentration of 2.5 nM. To determine non-specific binding, [3H]-PGD2 binding to the CRTh2 receptor is competed with using unlabelled PGD2 at a final well concentration of 1 pM. The experiment is done in triplicate, with reagents added to the wells as follows:<br>
-	25 uL assay buffer for total binding or<br>
-	25 uL PGD2 to determine non-specific binding<br>
-	25 ML [3H]PGD2<br>
-	50 uL membranes<br>
-	25 (it test compound in DMSO/assay buffer<br>
The plates are incubated at room temperature on a shaker for 1 hour, and then harvested (Tomtec Harvester 9600) onto GF/C filter plates using wash buffer (10 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4). The plate is dried for 2 hours, prior to addition of Micro-Scint 20™ (50 uL) and sealing with TopSeal-S™. Plates are then counted using a Packard Top Count instrument, Plates are then read on the Packard Topcount with the 3H Scintillation program (1 min per well).<br><br>
Ki (dissocation constant for the inhibition) values for the CRTh2 antagonists are reported. Ki values are determined using Sigma Plot™ software, using the Cheng-Prussoff equation.<br>
Ki =    IC60/1+[S]/Kd<br>
where SJsJhe concentration of radioljgand and Kd is the dissociation constant.<br>
assay protocol<br>
This assay is conducted in CHO.K1-CRTh2 cells. cAMP is generated in the cell by stimulating cells with 5 ]M forskolin, an adenylate cyclase activator. PGDz is added to activate the CRTh2 receptor which results in the attenuation of the forskolin-induced cAMP accumulation. Potential CRTh2 antagonists are tested for their ability to inhibit the PGD2-mediated attenuation of the forskolin-induced cAMP accumulation in CHO.K1-CRTh2 cells.<br>
For each concentration value on the dose-response curve, test compounds are prepared in assay stimulation buffer (HBSS, 5 mM HEPES, 10 ^M IBMX ± 0.1% human serum albumin) containing DMSO (3% vol/vol) and 5 uL/well is added to an assay plate (384 well white optiplate).<br>
CHO.K1-CRTH2 cultured in tissue culture flasks are washed with PBS and harvested with dissociation buffer. Cells are washed with PBS and resuspended in stimulation buffer to a concentration of 0.4 x 106/ ml and added to the assay plate (10<br>
Ml/well).<br>
The assay plate is incubated at room temperature on a shaker for 15 minutes.<br>
A mix of agonist (10 nM Prostaglandin D2) and 5 uM forskolin is prepared in assay stimulation buffer and added to the assay plate (5 uL/well).<br>
In addition, a cAMP standard is serially diluted in assay stimulation buffer and added to separate empty wells on the assay plate (20 uL/well). The cAMP standard allows for the quantification of cAMP generated in CHO.K1-CRTH2 cells.<br>
The assay plate is incubated at room temperature on a shaker for 60 minutes.<br>
Cell lysis buffer (Lysis buffer; Milfi-Q H20, 5 mM HEPES, 0.3% Tween-20, 0.1% human serum albumin) is added to a bead mix (containing Alphascreen™ anti-cAMP acceptor beads 0.08 units/jj_, Alphascreen™ streptavidin-coated donor beads 0.06<br><br>
units/fit, biotinylated cAMP 0.06 units/nL, 10|iM IBMX) is prepared under darkened conditions 60 minutes prior to addition to the assay plate. The resulting lysis mix is added to all wells of the assay plate (40 pL/well).<br>
The assay plate is sealed with Topseal-S™ and incubated in the dark at room temperature on a shaker for 45 minutes. The plate is then counted using a Packard Fusion™ instrument.<br>
The resulting counts per minute are converted to nM cAMP by using the prepared cAMP standard curve. IC5o values (concentration of CRTH2 antagonist required to inhibit 50% of the PGD2-mediated attenuation of forskolin-induced cAMP accumulation in CHO.K1~CRTh2 cells) are then determined using Prism™ software.<br>

Compounds of formulae (I) and (II), in free or salt form, are antagonists of the G-protein-coupied chemoattractant receptor CRTh2, expressed on Th2 cells, eosinophils and basophils, PGD2 is the natural ligand for CRTh2. Thus, antagonists which inhibit the binding of CRTh2 and PGD2 are useful in the treatment of allergic and anti-inflammatory conditions. Treatment in accordance with the invention may be symptomatic or prophylactic.<br>
Accordingly, agents of the invention are useful in the treatment of inflammatory or obstructive airways diseases, resulting, e.g., in reduction of tissue damage, airways inflammation, bronchial hyperreactivity, remodelling or disease progression. Inflammatory or obstructive airways diseases to which the present invention is applicable include asthma of whatever type or genesis including both intrinsic (non-allergic) asthma and extrinsic<br><br>
(allergic) asthma, mild asthma, moderate asthma, severe asthma, bronchitis asthma, exercise-induced asthma, occupational asthma and asthma induced following bacterial infection. Treatment of asthma is also to be understood as embracing treatment of subjects, e.g., of less than 4 or 5 years of age, exhibiting wheezing symptoms and diagnosed or diagnosable as "wheezy infants", an established patient category of major medical concern and now often identified as incipient or early-phase asthmatics. (For convenience this particular asthmatic condition is referred to as "wheezy-infant syndrome".)<br>
Prophylactic efficacy in the treatment of asthma will be evidenced by reduced frequency or severity of symptomatic attack, e.g., of acute asthmatic or bronchoconstrictor attack, improvement in lung function or improved airways hyperreactivity. It may further be evidenced by reduced requirement for other, symptomatic therapy, i.e., therapy for or intended to restrict or abort symptomatic attack when it occurs, e.g., anti-inflammatory (e.g., corticosteroid) or bronchodilatory. Prophylactic benefit in asthma may, in particular, be apparent in subjects prone to "morning dipping". "Morning dipping" is a recognised asthmatic syndrome, common to a substantial percentage of asthmatics and characterised by asthma attack, e.g., between the hours of about 4-6 a.m., i.e., at a time normally substantially distant from any previously administered symptomatic asthma therapy.<br>
Other inflammatory or obstructive airways diseases and conditions to which the present invention is applicable include acute lung injury (All), adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), chronic obstructive pulmonary, airways or lung disease (COPD, COAD or COLD), including chronic bronchitis or dyspnea associated therewith, emphysema, as well as exacerbation of airways hyperreactivity consequent to other drug therapy, in particular, other inhaled drug therapy. The invention is also applicable to the treatment of bronchitis of whatever type or genesis including, e.g., acute, arachidic, catarrhal, croupus, chronic or phthinoid bronchitis. Further inflammatory or obstructive airways diseases to which the present invention is applicable include pneumoconiosis (an inflammatory, commonly occupational, disease of the lungs, frequently accompanied by airways obstruction, whether chronic or acute, and occasioned by repeated inhalation of dusts) of whatever type or genesis including, e.g., aluminosis, anthracosis, asbestosis, chalicosis, ptilosis, siderosis, silicosis, tabacosis and byssinosis.<br>
Having regard to their anti-inflammatory activity, in particular, in relation to inhibition of eosinophil activation, agents of the invention are also useful in the treatment of eosinophil related disorders, e.g., eosinophilia, in particular, eosinophils-related disorders of the airways, e.g., involving morbid eosinophilic infiltration of pulmonary tissues including<br><br>
hypereosinophilia as it effects the airways and/or lungs, as well as, e.g., eosinophil-related disorders of the airways consequential or concomitant to Loffler's syndrome; eosinophilic pneumonia; parasitic, in particular, metazoan, infestation including tropical eosinophilia; bronchopulmonary aspergiilosis; polyarteritis nodosa including Churg-Strauss syndrome; eosinophilic granulorna; and eosinophil-related disorders affecting the airways occasioned by drug-reaction.<br>
Agents of the Invention are also useful in the treatment of inflammatory or allergic conditions of the skin, e.g., psoriasis, contact dermatitis, atopic dermatitis, alopecia areata, erythema multiforma, dermatitis herpetiformis, scleroderma, vitiligo, hypersensitivity angiitis, urticaria, bullous pemphigoid, lupus erythematosus, pemphisus, epidermolysis bullosa acquisita and other inflammatory or allergic conditions of the skin.<br>
Agents of the invention may also be used for the treatment of other diseases or conditions, in particular, diseases or conditions having an inflammatory component/e.g., treatment of diseases and conditions of the eye, such as conjunctivitis, keratoconjunctivitis sicca and vernal conjunctivitis; diseases affecting the nose including allergic rhinitis; and inflammatory disease, in which autoimmune reactions are implicated or having an autoimmune compon-tnt or aetiology, including autoimmune hematological disorders, e.g., hemolytic anemia, aplastic anaemia, pure red cell anaemia and idiopathic thrombocytopenia; systemic lupus erythematosus; polychondritis; sclerodoma; Wegener granulamatosis; dermatomyositis; chronic active hepatitis; myasthenia gravis; Steven-Johnson syndrome; idiopathic sprue; autoimmune inflammatory bowel disease, e.g., ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease; endocrine opthalmopathy; Grave's disease; sarcoidosis; alveolitis; chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis; multiple sclerosis; primary billiary cirrhosis; uveitte (anterior and posterior); keratoconjunctivitis sicca and vernal keratoconjunctivitis; interstitial lung fibrosis; psoriatic arthritis; and glomerulonephritis, with and without nephrotic syndrome, e.g., including idiopathic nephrotic syndrome or minal change nephropathy.<br>
Other diseases or conditions which may be treated with agents of the invention include septic shock; rheumatoid arthritis; osteoarthritis; proliferate diseases, such as cancer; atherosclerosis; allograft rejection following transplantation; stroke; obesity; restenosis; diabetes, e.g., diabetes mellitus type I Quvenile diabetes) and diabetes mellitus type II; diarrhoeal diseases; ischemia/reperfusion injuries; retinopathy, such as diabetic retinopathy or hyperbaric oxygen-induced retinopathy; and conditions characterised by elevated intraocular pressure or secretion of ocular aqueous humor, such as glaucoma.<br><br>
