CROSS RI;I I:RI-:NCI- TO RITA IT:D APPLICATION<br>
10001]	This application claims the benefit of United States Provisional Patent Application<br>
No. 60/912.961, filed April 20th, 2007, and which is hereby incorporated by reference in its<br>
entirety.<br>
TIiCIINICAL FIKLD<br>
[0002]	The present invention relates to a power transmission having four planetary gear<br>
sets that are controlled by five torque-transmitting devices to provide at least eight forward<br>
speed ratios and at least one reverse speed ratio.<br>
BACKGROUND OF Till- INVENTION<br>
[0003]	Passenger vehicles include a powcrtrain that is comprised of an engine, multi<br>
speed transmission, and a differential or final drive. The multi-speed transmission increases<br>
the overall operating range of the vehicle by permitting the engine to operate through its torque<br>
range a number of times. The number of forward speed ratios that are available in the<br>
transmission determines the number of times the engine torque range is repeated. Early<br>
automatic transmissions had two speed ranges. This severely limited the overall speed range<br>
of the vehicle and therefore required a relatively large engine that could produce a wide speed<br>
and torque range. This resulted in the engine operating at a specific fuel consumption point<br>
during cruising, other than the most efficient point. Therefore, manually-shifted (countershaft<br>
transmissions) were the most popular.<br>
]0004]	With the advent of three- and four-speed automatic transmissions, the automatic<br>
shifting (planetary gear) transmission increased in popularity with the motoring public. These<br>
transmissions improved the operating performance and fuel economy of the vehicle. The<br>
increased number of speed ratios reduces the step size between ratios and therefore improves<br><br>
2<br>
the shift quality of the transmission by making the ratio interchanges substantially<br>
imperceptible to the operator under normal vehicle acceleration.<br>
[0005]	Six speed transmissions offer several advantages over four- and five-speed<br>
transmissions, including improved vehicle acceleration and improved fuel economy. While<br>
many trucks employ power transmissions having six or more forward speed ratios, passenger<br>
cars are still manufactured with three- and four-speed automatic transmissions and relatively<br>
few five- or six speed devices due to the size and complexity of these transmissions.<br>
[0006]	Seven-, eight- and nine-speed transmissions provide further improvements in<br>
acceleration and fuel economy over six-speed transmissions. However, like the six-speed<br>
transmissions discussed above, the development of seven-, eight- and nine-speed transmissions<br>
has been precluded because of complexity, size and cost.<br>
SUMMARY Of Till-; INVENTION<br>
[0007]	The first embodiment of the present invention provides an improved<br>
transmission having four planetary gear sets controlled to provide at least eight forward speed<br>
ratios and at least one reverse speed ratio.<br>
[0008]	The transmission family of the present invention has four planetary gear sets,<br>
each of which includes a first, second and third member, which members may comprise a sun<br>
gear, a ring gear, or a planet carrier assembly member, in any order.<br>
[0009]	In referring to the first, second, third and fourth gear sets in this description and<br>
in the claims, these sets may be counted "first" to "fourth" in any order in the drawing (i.e.,<br>
left to right, right to left, etc.). Additionally, the first, second or third members of each gear<br>
set may be counted "first" to "third" in any order in the drawing (i.e., top to bottom, bottom<br>
to top, etc.) for each gear set.<br>
[0010]	l'.ach carrier member can be cither a single-pinion carrier member (simple) or a<br>
double-pinion carrier member (compound). Embodiments with long pinions are also possible.<br><br>
J<br>
|0011]	A first interconnecting member continuously connects the second member of the<br>
first planetary gear set with the second member of the second planetary gear set.<br>
[0012]	A second interconnecting member continuously connects the third member of<br>
the first planetary gear set with the first member of the third planetary gear set.<br>
|0013]	A third interconnecting member continuously connects the third member of the<br>
third planetary gear set with the first member of the fourth planetary gear set.<br>
{0014]	A fourth interconnecting member continuously connecting the first member of<br>
the second planetary gear set with the second member of the third planetary gear set.<br>
J0015]	The first member of the first planetary gear set is continuously connected with<br>
the stationary member (transmission housing/casing).<br>
10016]	The input member is continuously connected with the second member of the first<br>
planetary gear set. The output member is continuously connected with the second member of the<br>
fourth planetary gear set.<br>
[0017]	A first torque transmitting device, such as a brake, selectively connects the third<br>
member of the fourth planetary gear set with a stationary member (transmission<br>
housing/casing).<br>
[0018]	A second torque-transmitting device, such as a clutch, selectively connects a<br>
member of the first or third planetary gear set with a member of the third planetary gear set.<br>
[0019]	A third torque-transmitting device, such as a clutch, selectively connects a<br>
member of the first or second planelary gear set with the third member of the third planetary<br>
gear set.<br>
[0020]	A fourth torque-transmitting device, such as a clutch, selectively connects the<br>
third member of the second planetary gear set with the second member of the fourth planetary<br>
gear set.<br>
[0021]	A fifth torque-transmitting device, such as a clutch, selectively connects a<br>
member of the second or third planetary gear set with the second member of the fourth<br>
planetary gear set.<br><br>
4<br>
|00221	The five torque transmitting devices are selectively engageablc in combinations<br>
of two to yield at least eight forward speed ratios and at least one reverse speed ratio.<br>
[0023]	A variety of speed ratios and ratio spreads can be realized by suitably selecting<br>
the tooth ratios of the planetary gear sets. The transmission is particularly useful in a rear-<br>
wheel drive configuration. Also, it uses all single transition shifts, and provides two overdrive<br>
ratios.<br>
[0024]	The above features and other features and advantages of the present invention<br>
are readily apparent from the following detailed description of the best modes for carrying out<br>
the invention when taken in connection with the accompanying drawings.<br>

[0037]	The planetary gear arrangement also includes five torque-transmitting devices<br>
80, 82, 84, 85 and 86. The torque transmitting device 80 is a stationary-type torque-<br>
transmitting device, commonly termed brake or reaction clutch. The torque-transmitting<br><br>
6<br>
devices 82, 84, 85 and 86 are rotating-type torque-transmitting devices, commonly termed<br>
clutches.<br>
[0038]	The input member 17 is continuously connected with the planet carrier assembly<br>
member 26 of the planetary gear set 20. The output member 19 is continuously connected<br>
with the planet carrier assembly member 56 of the planetary gear set 50. The sun gear<br>
member 22 of the planetary gear set 20 is continuously connected with the transmission<br>

7<br>
[0041]	As shown in Figure lb, and in particular the truth table disclosed therein, the<br>
torque-transmitting devices are selectively engaged in combinations of two to provide at least<br>
eight forward speed ratios and at least one reverse speed ratio, all with single transition<br>
sequential shifts, and including two overdrive ratios.<br>
[0042]	As set forth above, the engagement schedule for the torque-transmitting devices<br>
is shown in the truth table of Figure lb. The chart of Figure lb describes the gear ratios and<br>
ratio steps that are attained in the above described transmission. For example, the step ratio<br>
between the first and second forward speed ratios is 1.53, while the step ratio between the<br>
reverse speed ratio and first forward ratio is -0.83.<br>
[0043]	Referring to Figure lc, the embodiment of powertrain 10 depicted in Fig. la is<br>
illustrated in a lever diagram format. A lever diagram is a schematic representation of the<br>
components of a mechanical device such as an automatic transmission. Fach individual lever<br>
represents a planetary gearset, wherein the three basic mechanical components of the planetary<br>
gear are each represented by a node. Therefore, a single lever contains three nodes: one for<br>
the sun gear member, one for the planet gear carrier member, and one for the ring gear<br>
member. The relative length between the nodes of each lever can be used to represent the ring-<br>
to-sun ratio of each respective gearset. These lever ratios, in turn, are used to vary the gear<br>
ratios of the transmission in order to achieve appropriate ratios and ratio progression.<br>
Mechanical couplings or interconnections between the nodes of the various planetary gear sets<br>
are illustrated by thin, horizontal lines and torque-transmitting devices such as clutches and<br>
brakes are presented as interleaved fingers. If the device is a brake, one set of the fingers is<br>
grounded. Further explanation of the format, purpose and use of lever diagrams can be found<br>
in SAF Paper 810102, authored by Benford, Howard and Leising, Maurice, "The Lever<br>
Analogy: A New Tool in Transmission Analysis", 1981, which is hereby fully incorporated by<br>
reference.<br>
[0044]	The powertrain 10 includes an input member 17 continuously connected with the<br>
engine 12, an output member 19 continuously connected with the final drive 16, a first<br><br>
8<br>
planetary gear set 20A having three nodes: a first node 22A, a seeond node 26A and a third<br>
node 24A; a second planetary gear set 30A having three nodes: a first node 32A, a second<br>
node 36A and a third node 34A; a third planetary gear set 40A having three nodes: a first node<br>
42A, a second node 46A and a third node 44A; and a fourth planetary gear set 50A having<br>
three nodes: a first node 52A, a second node 56A and a third node 54A.<br>
[0045]	The input member 17 is continuously connected with node 26A. The output<br>
member 19 is continuously connected with node 56A. The node 22A is continuously<br>
connected with the transmission housing 60.<br>
[0046]	A first torque-transmitting device, such as brake 80, selectively engages the<br>
node 54A with the transmission housing 60. A second torque-transmitting device, such as<br>
clutch 82, selectively engages the nodes 24A and 42A with the node 44A. A third torque-<br>
transmitting device, such as clutch 84, selectively engages the nodes 26A and 36A with the<br>
node 44A. A fourth torque-transmitting device, such as clutch 85, selectively engages the<br>
node 34A with the node 56A. A fifth torque-transmitting device, such as clutch 86, selectively<br>
engages the nodes 32A and 46A with the node 56A.<br>
[0047]	To establish ratios, two torque-transmitting devices are engaged for each gear<br>
state. The engaged torque-transmitting devices are represented by an "X" in each respective<br>
row. For example, to establish reverse gear, the brake 80 and clutch 86 are engaged. The<br>
brake 80 engages the node 54A with the transmission housing 60. The clutch 86 engages the<br>
nodes 32A and 46A with the node 56A. Likewise, the eight forward speed ratios are achieved<br>
through different combinations of clutch engagement as per Figure lb.<br>
[0048J	The powcrtrain 10 may share components with a hybrid vehicle, and such a<br>
combination may be operable in a "charge-depleting mode'1. For purposes of the present<br>
invention, a "charge-depleting mode" is a mode wherein the vehicle is powered primarily by an<br>
electric motor/generator such that a battery is depleted or nearly depleted when the vehicle<br>
reaches its destination. In other words, during the charge-depleting mode, the engine 12 is only<br>
operated to the extent necessary to ensure that the battery is not depleted before the destination is<br><br>
9<br>
reached. A conventional hybrid vehicle operates in a "charge-sustaining mode", wherein if the<br>
battery charge level drops below a predetermined level (e.g., 25%) the engine is automatically<br>
run to recharge the battery. Therefore, by operating in a charge-depleting mode, the hybrid<br>
vehicle can conserve some or all of the fuel that would otherwise be expended to maintain the<br>
25% battery charge level in a conventional hybrid vehicle. It should be appreciated that a hybrid<br>
vehicle powertrain is preferably only operated in the charge-depleting mode if the battery can be<br>
recharged after the destination is reached by plugging it into an energy source.<br>

second torque transmitting device, such as clutch 182, selectively connects the sun gear<br>
member 142 of the planetary gear set 140 with the planet carrier assembly member 146 of the<br>
planetary gear set 140. A third torque-transmitting device, such as clutch 184, selectively<br>
connects the ring gear member 134 of the planetary gear set 130 with the ring gear member<br>
144 of the planetary gear set 140. A fourth torque-transmitting device, such as clutch 185,<br>
selectively connects the ring gear member 134 of the planetary gear set 130 with the planet<br>
carrier assembly member 156 of the planetary gear set 150. A fifth torque-transmitting device,<br>
such as clutch 186, selectively connects the planet carrier assembly member 146 of the<br>
planetary gear set 140 with the planet carrier assembly member 156 of the planetary gear set<br>
150.<br>
[0059]	As set forth above, the engagement schedule for the torque transmitting devices<br>
is shown in the truth table of Figure 2b. The chart of Figure 2b describes the gear ratios and<br>
ratio steps that are attained in the above described transmission. For example, the step ratio<br>
between the first and second forward speed ratios is 1.59, while the step ratio between the<br>
reverse speed ratio and first forward ratio is -0.72.<br>
[0060]	Referring to Figure 2c, the embodiment of powertrain 110 depicted in Fig. 2a is<br>
illustrated in a lever diagram format.<br>
[0061]	The powertrain 110 includes an input member 17 continuously connected with<br>
the engine 12, an output member 19 continuously connected with the final drive 16, a first<br>
planetary gear set 120A having three nodes: a first node 122A, a second node 126A and a third<br>
node 124A; a second planetary gear set BOA having three nodes: a first node 132A, a second<br>
node 136A and a third node 134A; a third planetary gear set 140A having three nodes: a first<br>
node 142A, a second node 146A and a third node 144A; and a fourth planetary gear set 150A<br>
having three nodes: a first node 152A, a second node 156A and a third node 154A.<br><br>
12<br>
[0062]	The input member 17 is continuously connected with the node 126A. The<br>
output member 19 is continuously connected with node 156A. The node 122A is continuously<br>
connected with the transmission housing 160.<br>
[0063]	The node 126A is continuously connected with the node 136A. The node 124A<br>
is continuously connected with the node 142A. The node 144A is continuously connected with<br>
the node 152A. The node 132A is continuously connected with the node 146A.<br>
[0064]	A first torque-transmitting device, such as brake 180, selectively connects the<br>
node 154A with the transmission housing 160. A second torque-transmitting device, such as<br>
clutch 182, selectively connects the node 142A with the node 146A. A third torque-<br>
transmitting device, such as clutch 184, selectively connects the node 134A with the node<br>
144A. A fourth torque-transmitting device, such as clutch 185, selectively connects the node<br>
134A with the node 156A. A fifth torque-transmitting device, such as clutch 186, selectively<br>
connects the node 146A with the node 156A.<br>
[0065[	I ° establish ratios, two torque-transmitting devices are engaged for each gear<br>
state. The engaged torque-transmitting devices are represented by an "X" in each respective<br>
row. For example, to establish reverse gear, the brake 180 and clutch 186 are engaged. The<br>
brake 180 engages the node 154A with the transmission housing 160. The clutch 186 engages<br>
the node 146A with the node 156A. Likewise, the eight forward ratios are achieved through<br>
different combinations of clutch engagement as per Figure 2c.<br>
[0066|	The powertrain 110 may share components with a hybrid vehicle, and such a<br>
combination may be operable in a "'charge-depleting mode", for purposes of the present<br>
invention, a "charge-depleting mode" is a mode wherein the vehicle is powered primarily by an<br>
electric motor/generator such that a battery is depleted or nearly depleted when the vehicle<br>
reaches its destination. In other words, during the charge-depleting mode, the engine 12 is only<br>
operated to the extent necessary to ensure that the battery is not depleted before the destination is<br>
reached. A conventional hybrid vehicle operates in a "'charge-sustaining mode", wherein if the<br>
battery charge level drops below a predetermined level (e.g., 25%) the engine is automatically<br><br>
13<br>
run to recharge the battery. Therefore, by operating in a charge-depleting mode, the hybrid<br>
vehicle can conserve some or all of the fuel that would otherwise be expended to maintain the<br>
25% battery charge level in a conventional hybrid vehicle. It should be appreciated that a hybrid<br>
vehicle powcrtrain is preferably only operated in the charge-depleting mode if the battery can be<br>
recharged after the destination is reached by plugging it into an energy source.<br>

detail, those familiar with the art to which this invention relates will recognize various<br>
