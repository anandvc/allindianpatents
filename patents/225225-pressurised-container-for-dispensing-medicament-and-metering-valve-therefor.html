				<td>"PRESSURISED CONTAINER FOR DISPENSING MEDICAMENT AND<br>
METERING VALVE THEREFOR"<br>
This invention relates to improvements in drug<br>
delivery devices and particularly a pressurised container/for dispensing<br>
a metered dose of medicament and metering valve therefor.<br>
In metered dose inhalers, an aerosol stream from<br>
a pressurised dispensing container is fired towards a<br>
patient or user of the inhaler into an air flow. The<br>
air flow is created by a user inhaling through a<br>
mouthpiece of the inhaler and the medicament is<br>
released into this air flow at a point between the air<br>
inlet holes and the mouthpiece.<br>
Conventional metering valves for use with<br>
pressurised dispensing containers comprise a valve<br>
stem coaxially slidable within a valve member defining<br>
an annular metering chamber, and outer and inner<br>
annular seals operative between the respective outer<br>
and inner ends of the valve stem and the valve member<br>
to seal the metering chamber therebetween. The valve<br>
stem is hollow whereby in a non-dispensing position of<br>
the valve stem, the metering chamber is connected to<br>
the container and charged with product therefrom. The<br>
valve stem is movable against the action of a spring<br>
to a dispensing position wherein the metering chamber<br>
is isolated from the container and vented to<br>
atmosphere for the discharge of product.<br>
Other drug delivery devices include apparatus in<br>
which capsules containing a powdered medicament are<br>
mechanically opened at a dispensing station where<br>
inhaled air subsequently entrains the powder, which is<br>
then dispensed through a mouthpiece.<br>
A problem with all such drug delivery devices is<br>
that deposition of the medicament, or a solid<br>
component from a suspension of a particulate product<br>
in a liquid propellant, on the internal surfaces and<br>
other components of the devices occurs after a number<br>
of operation cycles and/or storage. This can lead to<br>
reduced efficiency of operation of the device and of<br>
the resulting treatment in that deposition of the<br>
product reduces the amount of active drug available to<br>
be dispensed.<br>
Some prior art devices rely or. the dispenser<br>
being shaken in an attempt to dislodge the deposited<br>
particles as a result of the movement of a liquid<br>
propellant and product mixture. However, whilst this<br>
remedy is effective within the body of the container<br>
itself, it is not effective for particles deposited on<br>
the inner surfaces of the metering chamber. As the<br>
size of the chamber is significantly smaller, the<br>
restricted flow of fluid in the metering chamber<br>
(caused by the tortuosity of the flow path through the<br>
chamber) means that the fluid in the metering chamber<br>
does not move with enough energy to adequately remove<br>
the deposited particles.<br>
One solution is proposed in our pending<br>
application GB 97211684.0 in which a liner of a<br>
material such as fluoropolymer, ceramic or glass is<br>
included to line a portion of the wall of a metering<br>
chamber in a metering valve. Although this solves the<br>
problem of deposition in these types of dispensers, it<br>
does require the re-design or modification of moldings<br>
and mould tools for producing the valve members to<br>
allow for the insertion of the liner.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to<br>
provide drug delivery devices in general in which the<br>
deposition of the product and active drug component is<br>
minimised.<br>
According to the invention there is provided<br>
apparatus for dispensing a medicament, wherein at<br>
least a portion of one or more of the internal<br>
surfaces of components of the apparatus which come<br>
into contact with medicament during storage or<br>
dispensing has a layer of one or more cold plasma<br>
polymerised monomers bonded to at least a portion<br>
thereof.<br>
A particular embodiment of the present invention<br>
will now be described, by way of example only, with<br>
reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:<br>
Figure 1 is a cross-sectional view through an<br>
inhaler, which is one type of drug delivery device of<br>
the present invention; and<br>
Figure 2 is a cross-sectional view of a metering<br>
valve used in another type of drug delivery device.<br>
In Figure 1, an inhaler 10 for a product such as<br>
a medicament comprises a housing 11 for receiving a<br>
pressurised dispensing container 12 of a medicament<br>
and a mouthpiece 14 for insertion into the mouth of a<br>
user of the inhaler 10.<br>
The container housing 11 is generally cylindrical<br>
and open at its upper end. A lower wall 15 of the<br>
housing 11 includes an annular socket 16 for receiving<br>
the tubular valve stem 17 of the container 12. The<br>
socket 16 communicates via a duct 18 ending in an<br>
orifice 19 with the mouthpiece 14. The lower wall 15<br>
also has holes 20 for allowing air to flow through the<br>
container housing 11 into the mouthpiece 14.<br>
The mouthpiece 14 may be generally circular or<br>
shaped to fit the mouth and is connected to or forms a<br>
part of the housing 11.<br>
In use, a patient or user holds the inhaler 10,<br>
usually in one hand, and applies his mouth to the<br>
mouthpiece 14. The user then inhales through the<br>
mouthpiece 14 and this creates an airflow through the<br>
cylindrical housing 11, from its open end around the<br>
dispensing container 12, through the holes 20 and into<br>
the mouthpiece 14. After the user has started<br>
inhaling through the mouthpiece 14, the container 12<br>
is depressed downwardly onto its stem 17 to release a<br>
dose of medicament from the container 12. The dose of<br>
medicament is projected by the pressure in the<br>
container 12 via the duct 18 and through the orifice<br>
19. It then mixes with the airflow through the<br>
mouthpiece 14 and is hence inhaled by the user.<br>
In traditional inhalers, all of the components<br>
are plastic mouldings, which gives rise to the<br>
deposition problems described above. The particular<br>
problem areas in devices such as inhalers are the<br>
internal surfaces 21 of the mouthpiece 14, the _<br>
internal surfaces 22 of the duct 18 and the walls 23<br>
defining the orifice 19. In some inhalers 10, the<br>
diameter of at least a part of the duct 18 can be as<br>
little as 0.5mm and so any deposition on its internal<br>
surfaces 22 could lead to not only the problem of a<br>
reduction in active drug components being available,<br>
but also dispensing difficulties.<br>
The metering valve 110 illustrated in Figure 2 is<br>
another type of drug delivery device or dispenser, and<br>
includes a valve stem 111 which protrudes from and is<br>
axially slidable within a valve member 112, the valve<br>
member 112 and valve stem 111 defining therebetween an<br>
annular metering chamber 113. The valve member 112 is<br>
located within a valve body 114 which is positioned in<br>
a pressurised container (not shown) containing a<br>
product to be dispensed. The metering valve 110 is<br>
held in position with respect to the container by<br>
means of a ferrule 115 crimped to the top of the<br>
container and sealing being provided between the valve<br>
body 114 and container by an annular gasket 116.<br>
An outer seal 117 and an inner seal 118 of an<br>
elastomeric material extend radially between the valve<br>
stem 111 and the valve member 112. The outer seal 117<br>
is radially compressed between the valve member 112<br>
and valve stem 111 so as to provide positive sealing<br>
contact, the compression being achieved by using a<br>
seal which provides an interference fit on the valve<br>
stem 111 and/or by the crimping of the ferrule 115<br>
onto the pressurised container during assembly.<br>
The valve stem 111 has an end 119 which protrudes<br>
from the valve member 112 and ferrule 115 which is a<br>
hollow tube and which is closed off by flange 120<br>
which is located within the metering chamber 113. The<br>
hollow end 119 of valve stem 111 includes a discharge<br>
port 121 extending radially through the side wall of<br>
the valve stem 111. The valve stem 111 further has an<br>
intermediate section 122, which is also hollow and<br>
defining a central passage and which has a pair of<br>
spaced radial ports 123, 124 which are interconnected<br>
through a central cavity.<br>
A spring 125 extends between a second flange 126,<br>
separating the intermediate section 122 of the valve<br>
stem 111 and an inner end 127 of the valve stem 111,<br>
and an end of the valve body 114 to bias the valve<br>
stem 111 in a non-dispensing position in which the<br>
first flange 120 is held in sealing contact with the<br>
outer seal 117. The second flange 126 is located<br>
outside the valve member 112, but within the valve<br>
body 114.<br>
The metering chamber 113 is sealed from the<br>
atmosphere by the outer seal 117, and from the<br>
pressurised container to which the valve 110 is<br>
attached by the inner seal 118. In the illustration<br>
of the valve 110 shown in Figure 1 radial ports 123,<br>
124, together with the central cavity in the<br>
intermediate section 122 of the valve member 111<br>
connect the metering chamber 113 with the container so<br>
that in this non-dispensing condition the metering<br>
member 113 will be charged with product to be<br>
dispensed.<br>
Upon depression of the valve stem 111 relative to<br>
the valve member 112 so that it moves inwardly into<br>
the container, the radial port 124 is closed off as it<br>
passes through the inner seal 118, thereby isolating<br>
the metering chamber 113 from the contents of the<br>
pressurised container. Upon further movement of the<br>
valve stem 111 in the same direction to a dispensing<br>
position the discharge port 121 passes through the<br>
outer seal 117 into communication with the metering<br>
chamber 113. In this dispensing position the product<br>
in the metering chamber 113 is free to be discharged<br>
to the atmosphere via the discharge port 121 and the<br>
cavity in the hollow end 119 of the valve stem 111.<br>
When the valve stem 111 is released, the biasing<br>
of the return spring 125 causes the valve stem 111 to<br>
return to its original position. As a result the<br>
metering chamber 113 becomes recharged in readiness<br>
for further dispensing operations.<br>
The component parts of conventional drug<br>
dispensing devices, such as valve members, valve<br>
stems, inhaler housings and so on, are generally<br>
formed as single mouldings from material such as<br>
acetal, polyester or nylon which are prone to the<br>
deposition problems described above. Although in some<br>
cases it might be possible to include a separate liner<br>
of a material such as a fluoropolymer, ceramic or<br>
glass to line a portion of the area in which<br>
deposition problems occurs, this requires the re-<br>
design or modification of mouldings and mould tools so<br>
that the components can accommodate such liners.<br>
In the present invention we propose a solution in<br>
which the component parts of the drug dispensing<br>
devices are made by conventional tooling and moulds<br>
from the traditional materials listed above. They are<br>
then subjected to a cold plasma polymerisation<br>
treatment of one or more monomers which is a<br>
"hydrophobic" treatment which creates a very thin<br>
layer of the plasma polymer on the surface of the<br>
component parts which significantly reduces the<br>
deposition of active drugs on the relevant surfaces<br>
due to factors such as anti-frictional and waterproof<br>
characteristics and low surface energy.<br>
The preferred monomers to use in this process are<br>
perfluoro-cyclohexane or perfluoro-hexane which would<br>
create a thin layer of plasma polymerised fluoro-<br>
cyclohexane or fluoro-hexane on the appropriate<br>
surface. Other fluorinated hydrocarbons may also be<br>
used, such as tetrafluoroethylene (TFE),<br>
trifluoroethylene, vinylidene fluoride and vinyl<br>
fluoride. The two monomers fluoroethylene and<br>
fluoropropylene may also be used to form the co-<br>
polymer fluorinated ethylene-propylene (FEP). As a<br>
further alternative, siloxanes may be used, such as<br>
dimethyl siloxane, to give a layer of plasma<br>
polymerised dimethylsiloxane.<br>
The process is known as "cold plasma" treatment<br>
as the temperature within the body of the plasma is<br>
ambient. Thus thermoplastic materials such as<br>
polybutyrene terephthalate (PBT), nylon, acetile and<br>
tetrabutyrene terephthalate (TBT) can be treated<br>
without fear of thermal damage. The treatment is a<br>
vacuum procedure in which the components are placed<br>
inside a chamber which is evacuated to less than 0.005<br>
Torr. One or more monomers are introduced to the<br>
chamber at a controlled rate and a 13.56 MHZ r.f.<br>
signal is applied to an external antenna. The plasma<br>
is ignited within the chamber and maintained for a<br>
given time at the preselected power setting. At the<br>
end of the treatment the plasma is extinguished, the<br>
chamber flushed and the products retrieved. As a<br>
result a thin layer (for example 0.005 to 0.5 microns)<br>
of the plasma polymerised material is intimately<br>
bonded to the surface of the component.<br>
Either an entire component within the drug<br>
delivery device, or just the surfaces of one or more<br>
component which would come into contact with the<br>
medicament during actuation, could be treated to<br>
provide an improved drug delivery device according to<br>
the present invention. In the case of the type of<br>
inhalers as shown in Figure 1, surfaces 21, 22 and 23<br>
may be treated. In a typical dry powder inhaler, the<br>
inner surface of the mouthpiece and any channel<br>
leading to the mouthpiece from the point of powder<br>
storage, i.e. from a capsule, bulk storage chamber or<br>
a pre-metered chamber of a device. In the metering<br>
valve of Figure 2, the valve member 112 alone may be<br>
treated. However, additional benefits can be achieved<br>
in treating some or all of the other plastic and<br>
rubber parts of the valve, including the valve body<br>
114 and the seals 116, 117 and 118. Treatment of the<br>
seals 117 and 118 has the additional benefit that<br>
fiction between the seals 117 and 118 and valve stem<br>
111 is reduced resulting in easier operation of the<br>
device. The level of friction between the valve stem<br>
111 and seals 117 and 118 may be further reduced by<br>
treatment of the valve stem 111 itself. Such treatment<br>
reduces or eliminates the need for silicone emulsions<br>
or oils to be applied to the seals 117 and 118 and<br>
valve stem 111. Treatment of the seals 116, 117 and<br>
118 also has the benefits of reducing levels of<br>
extractibles where the seals are manufactured from<br>
elastomeric materials, reducing the permeability of<br>
the seals to the propellant in the pressurised<br>
dispensing container and reducing the levels of<br>
absorption of product onto the surfaces of the seals.<br>
The method can also be used to treat components of<br>
many other delivery devices including nasal pumps,<br>
non-pressurised actuators, foil storage types, breath<br>
actuated inhaler devices and breath co-ordinating<br>
devices and so on.<br>
