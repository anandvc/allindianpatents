				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to N-doped TiV mixed oxide and the process for the preparation thereof. More particularly, the present invention relates to N-doped TiV mixed oxide, an effective semiconducting photocatalytic material for overall water splitting to liberate hydrogen.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
In 1971, Fujishima and Honda reported that a TiO2 (rutile) photoanode photochemically split water into H2 and O2 in UV light under a small applied electrochemical potential [A. Fujishima, K. Honda, Bull. Chem. Soc. Jpn. 44 (1971) 1148; A. Fujishima, K. Honda, Nature 238 (1972) 37]. Since then, more than 130 semiconductors have been identified as catalysts for photochemical splitting of water [P.V. Kamat, J. Phys. Chem. C 111 (2007) 2834; F.E. Osterloh, Chem. Mater. 20 (2008) 35; K. Maeda, K. Domen, J. Phys. Chem. C 111 (2007) 7851; A. Kudo, Int. J. Hydr. Ener. 31 (2006) 197; Z.G. Zou, J.H. Ye, K. Sayama, H. Arakawa, Nature 414 (2001) 625; A.J. Bard, M.A. Fox, Acc. Chem. Res. 28 (1995)141]. The efficient conversion of solar energy into chemical fuels has great economic and environmental significance [N.S. Lewis, D.G. Nocera, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 103 (2003) 15729]. Catalytic splitting of pure water into hydrogen and oxygen in presence of semiconductor powders using visible light is a promising approach for storing solar energy as chemical energy [A. Fujishima, K. Honda, Nature 238 (1972) 37; J.S. Lee, Catal. Surv. Asia 9 (2005) 217; K. Maeda, K. Teramura, N. Saito, Y. Inoue, H. Kobayashi, K. Domen, J. Phys. Chem. C 111 (2007) 7851; A. Kudo, Y. Miseki, Chem. Soc. Rev. 38 (2009) 253]. The reaction is a typical "uphill reaction", having a large positive change in the Gibb's free energy (ΔGo = 238 kJ/mol). It is necessary for water splitting by semiconductor photocatalysts that their conduction band levels are more negative than the reduction potential of water to produce H2 and their valence band levels are more positive than the oxidation potential of H2O to produce O2. However, such a term of band potentials is just one of the requirements concerned with thermodynamics. Other important factors are also concerned with photocatalytic water splitting. Efficient charge separation and suppression of recombination between photogenerated electrons and holes are important factors for efficient photocatalytic water splitting. Moreover,<br>
  <br>
creation and separation of active sites for H2 and O2 evolution are also important. A great amount of work on TiO2 [R. Abe, K. Sayama, K. Domen, H. Arakawa, Chem. Phys. Lett. 344 (3-4) (2001) 339], N-doped TiO2 [H.G. Kim, D.W. Hwang, J.S. Lee, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 126 (29) (2004) 8912], modified pervoskites [K. Sayama, K. Mukasa, R. Abe, Y. Abe, H. Arakawa, Chem.

In this invention, we report herein a solid state reaction route for the synthesis of N-doped TiV mixed oxide which is used here for water splitting without using any co-catalyst and which is all together different material and superior to the literature reported inventions [J. Yuan, M. Chen, J. Shi, W. Shangguan, Inter. J. Hydro. Ener. 31 (2006) 1326; P. Charvin, S. Abanades, E. Beche, F. Lemont, G. Flamant, Solid State Ionics 180 (2009) 1003] and our own work [K.M. Parida, N. Biswal, D.P. Das, S. Martha, Inter. J. Hydro. Ener. 35 (2010) 5262].<br>
  <br>
The draw back and demerits of the existing photocatalytic materials such as TiO2, TiO2/ZrO2 (J. Andrews, US patent 7,261,942 (2007)) and Fe (III)-HY (M. Subrahmanyam et al., US patent 7,407,908 (2008)) are that they are active and effective under UV light. The semiconducting materials such as tantalum nitride, oxynitrides of La, Ta, Nb, Ti, Zr are also very much active for H2 production under UV-illumination. CdS and ZnS are the first studied visible light responsive catalyst for water splitting and photocatalytic degradation of pollutants in water. But both are prone to dissociation under light illumination, thus chemical unstable under reaction conditions. In order to utilize the free solar light, there is a need for the development of visible light responsive and chemically stable photocatalytic materials.<br>
CdS-ZTP samples were prepared by ionexchange and subsequent sulfurisation by taking sodium sulfide as the reagent. The preparation of photocatalysts takes very long time. All the photocatalysts absorb light at wavelength less than 450nm (Int journal of Hydrogen Energy, Vol 35, 11(2010) 5262-5269).<br>
Synthesis of Nitrogen (N)-doped TiO2 from TiCL; as precursor by heating urea and TiO2 was carried out at 350-700 °C in air and tested towards water splitting reaction for production of hydrogen gas. (Int journal of Hydrogen Energy, 31, 10, (2006), 1326-1331).<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The PXRD pattern of all the samples was recorded on a X'pert PRO PANanalytica diffractometer with automatic control. The patterns were run with monochromatic CuKa radiation from 28 = 10-70 ° with a scan rate of 2 °/min.

instead of 300 °C)<br>
Photochemical hydrogen generation experiments are carried out using a quartz batch<br>
reactor that is exposed to the light of medium pressure 125 W UV mercury lamp. The<br>
photon flux in the quartz flask was found to be 7 x 1019 photons/s for the 254 nm spectral<br>

The H2 liberated was observed to be 2679 µmol using 0.02 g of catalyst in 120 min of light illumination.<br>
Example 9: Photocatalytic water splitting over N-doped TiV mixed oxide (1:1:1, Hexamine as N-precursor) (Reactants: N-TiV (activation temperature 400 °C) = 1 g/L, Light source = 125 W visible lamp)<br>
A silica crucible is charged with 1.63 g of vanadyl (IV) sulfate, 2.762 g of titanium (IV) oxysulfate sulphuric acid complex hydrate and 1.4014 g hexamine. The mixture was pretreated at 110 °C in an air oven for 12 hour. The residue is ground to powdered form and activated at 400 °C for 2 hrs in a muffle furnace.<br>
Photochemical hydrogen generation experiments are carried out using a quartz batch reactor that is exposed to the light of medium pressure 125 W mercury visible lamp. The photon flux in the quartz flask was found to be 0.748475 x 1019 photons/m2s for the &gt; 420 nm spectral region, as determined with LUX meter with inbuilt Si-diode. For catalytic measurements, the glass flask is charged with 20 mg of catalyst in 20 mL of aqueous 20 mmol Na2S solution. The solution was kept under stirring with a magnetic stirrer. Prior to irradiation, the reaction mixture was purged with N2 in order to remove dissolved gases. The evolved gas was accumulated and analyzed by GC-17A (Shimadzu) using 5 A molecular sieve column in TCD mode.
