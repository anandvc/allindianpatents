				<td>FILED OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a miniature platinum resistance Temperature<br>
Detector device for monitoring of thrust bearing metal temperature of Boiler<br>
Feed Pump adoptable to thermal Power Station.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
The boiler Feed Pump is one of the important Auxiliary equipments in Turbine<br>
Generator (T-G) package of a thermal power station. The function of a Boiler<br>
Feed Pump is to feed high pressure and high temperature feed water to the<br>
boiler drum for steam generation.<br>
The boiler Feed Pump is provided with a tilting pad type thrust bearing to absorb<br>
the residual hydraulic thrust load during pump operation. The trust bearing is<br>
housed in a carbon steel casting called bearing housing. The thrust bearing is<br>
kept lubricated and cooled by circulating pressurized lubricating oil through the<br>
bearing housing.<br>
To ensure the safe operation of the pump, it is essential to maintain the thrust<br>
bearing temperature within the permissible limits. This is achieved by<br>
continuous monitoring of the bearing metal temperature by using a miniature<br><br>
cylindrical shaped Platinum Resistance Temperature Detector (RTD) which is<br>
inserted into a tiny radial hole drilled on the thrust bearing pad. The lead wires<br>
from this RTD are taken out of the pump through a hole provided on the bearing<br>
housing. The resistance signal output from this RTD is connected to a Data<br>
Acquisition System provided in the central control room of the power station and<br>
is used for continuous recording and monitoring of the pump bearing<br>
temperature.<br>
In the prior art, the miniature RTD is separate unit and the wires from the RTD<br>
are to be brought out through the hole in the pump bearing housing by properly<br>
sealing the wires using the following additional loose components.<br>
1)	One adaptor on bearing housing for fixing the connector assembly to<br>
bearing housing.<br>
2)	A connector assembly containing sealing bush to bring out the RTD wires.<br>
3)	One adaptor above connector assembly for joining the connector<br>
assembly to a male stud.<br>
4)	One male stud for fixing with a pliable conduit.<br>
5)	One Pliable conduit for routing the RTD wires and for protection of RTD<br>
wires.<br><br>
The following disadvantages were practically experienced during operation:-<br>
1)	The RTD wire has to be necessarily routed &amp; clipped in the bearing<br>
housing due to its flexible construction.<br>
2)	A leak proof joint cannot be ensured between the RTD wires &amp; the<br>
bearing housing.<br>
3)	Skill and time are required for the accurate assembly of the RTD unit at<br>
project site.<br>
4)	The RTD wires get damaged while fitting or removal of the RTD.<br>
5)	Connector assemble is not adjustable which is a drawback while taking<br>
out the RTD wires through the sealing bush.<br>
To overcome the above disadvantages, a modified resistance temperature<br>
detector device was envisaged for better monitoring of the temperature of the<br>
trust bearing metal temperatures.<br>
OBJECTIVE OF INVENTION<br>
It is therefore, an object of the present invention to propose a modified<br>
Resistance Temperature Detection device for monitoring of Thrust bearing metal<br>
temperature of boiler Feed pump which eliminates the disadvantages of existing<br>
state of art.<br><br>
Another object of the present invention is to propose a modified resistance<br>
temperature detection device for monitoring of thrust bearing metal temperature<br>
of boiler feed pump which ensures a correct results.<br>
A further object of the present invention is to propose a modified Resistance<br>
Temperature Detection device for monitoring of Thrust bearing metal<br>
temperature of boiler Feed pump which reduces the number of joining means for<br>
the wire.<br>
A still further object of the present invention is to propose a modified Resistance<br>
Temperature Detection device for monitoring of Thrust bearing metal<br>
temperature of boiler Feed pump which facilitates conducting of hydrostatic<br>
pressure test on the connector at vendor's works to ensure leak-proof joint<br>
between connector and RTD lead wires.<br>
STATEMENT OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a development of a modified RTD unit with<br>
integral connector for monitoring of Boiler Feed Pump thrust bearing metal<br>
temperature, which can be directly fitted on the pump bearing housing.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
Sketch-1 shown the site assembly of the prior art miniature RTD in the bearing<br>
housing with the help of loose components.<br><br>
Sketch-2 shown the newly designed RTD unit with integral connector which can<br>
be procured as a single unit and fitted directly on the pump bearing housing<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF THE<br>
INVENTION<br>
As shown in sketch-2, a modified shaped integral RTD assembly wherein<br>
1)	A stainless steel braid (armour) (2) is provided for a short length over the<br>
RTD wires. This makes the RTD wires semi flexible facilitating direct<br>
insertion into the thrust pad from the hole in the bearing housing. Direct<br>
insertion completely eliminates damages during assembly and removal.<br>
2)	Metallic feed through tube (3) is provided around the RTD wires to ensure<br>
leak proof joint at the sealing bush. (5) which is disposed inside the<br>
adjustable connector (4).<br>
3)	The RTD element(l), the armour (2) and the metallic feed through tube<br>
(3) are joined by a epoxy sealing compound forming a single unit.<br>
4)	A newly developed connector assembly (4) is provided which can be<br>
adjusted throughout the length of the feed through tube. (3)<br><br>
5)	A crimping pot (6) is provided which connects the feed through tube (3)<br>
to a stainless steel square link armour (7) for protection of RTD wires.<br>
6)	The open lead wires (8) are connected to a data acquisition system<br>
provided in the central room of the continuous recording and monitoring<br>
and the pump bearing metal temperature.<br><br>
