FATTY   ACID   DERIVATIVES   AND   PROCESS   FOR   PREPARATION<br>
THEREOF<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to a novel compound of formula I, process for the preparation of compound of formula I and process for the preparation of compound of formula II from compound of formula I. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 4,598,089 discloses (2S,3S,5S,7Z,10Z)-5-[(S)-2-formamido-4-methyl-valeryloxy]-2-hexyl-3-hydroxy-7,10-hexadecadienoic 1,3 acid lactone, also known as lipstatin, a fermentative process for its production, a process for its isolation from the broth and a process for its hydrogenation to 2-Formylamino-4-methyl-pentanoic acid l-(3-hexyl-4-oxo-oxetan-2-ylmethyl)-dodecyl ester.<br>
2-Formylamino-4-methyl-pentanoic acid l-(3-hexyl-4-oxo-oxetan-2-ylmethyl)-dodecyl ester, also known as orlistat is an anti-obesity agent.<br>
Conversion of lipstatin to tetrahydrolipstatin was the only available route for the manufacture of Orlistat.<br>
Since the prior art method for preparation of orlistat suffers from many drawbacks like low production levels of lipstatin, difficulties in the purification from impurities, low level of conversion of (2S,3S,5S,7Z,10Z)-5-[(S)-2-formamido-4-methyl-valeryloxy]-2-hexyl-3-hydroxy-7,10-hexadecadienoic 1,3 acid lactone to orlistat, high cost of linoleic acid used for the manufacture of (2S,3S,5S,7Z,10Z)-5-[(S)-2-formamido-4-methyl-valeryloxy]-2-hexyl-3-hydrox y-7,l(3-hexadecadienoic 1,3 acid lactone and the like, there is a need to find alternative method for production of orlistat which is cost effective, industrially<br><br>
applicable, requiring less steps of purification and ease of conversion to orlistat.<br>
We have now found that 2-Formylannino-4-methyl-pentanoic acid l-(3-hexyl-4-oxo-oxetan-2-ylmethyl)-dodecyl ester can be prepared by employing novel compounds of formula I. We have also found that the novel compounds of formula I can be prepared by a novel fermentation method.<br>
