The invention relates to a three-stage process for the continuous preparation of RTV-1 compositions.<br>
Organopolysiloxane compositions which can be stored with exclusion of moisture and crosslink at room temperature on admission of moisture, known as RTV-1 compositions, have been known for a long time.<br>
In the preparation of the RTV-1 compositions, not all constituents can be added in one step; rather, after mixing part of the constituents, a certain reaction time is necessary before further constituents are mixed in. Two-stage processes have been developed for this purpose. For example, in EP-A-234-226, part of the constituents is combined in a first step in a continuous closed mixer and, in a second step in a reciprocating kneader, the remaining constituents are metered in and the composition ip homogenized and degassed under reduced pressure in this kneader.<br>
RTV-1 compositions are, for various applications, compounded to form many different products which differ, for example, in terms of color, transparency or viscosity. In the process of. EP-A-234 226, when the product is changed, for example in the case of a color change, the entire reciprocating kneader has to be cleaned or at least generously purged with the composition according to the changed formulation. This<br>
is associated with large losses.<br>
i<br>
It is an object of the invention to provide a process for the continuous preparation of RTV-1 compositions in which a change of formulation results in small losses of time and RTV-1 composition.<br>
The invention provides a three-stage process for the continuous preparation of RTV-1 compositions, which comprises,<br>
in a first step, preparing a raw mixture of ω,ω dihydroxypolydiorganosiloxane, filler and, if desired, further constituents,<br><br>
in a second step, freeing the new mixture or gas inclusions under reduced pressure and, if desired, mixing it with further constituents and, in a third step, mixing the degassed raw mixture with a crosslinker, a condensation catalyst and, if desired, additional constituents not yet added in the first and second steps.<br>
The invention is based on the recognition that th^ degassing step does not necessarily have to be carried out after all constituents have been mixed, but can be brought forward to a point after mixing a,(Q-dihydroxypolydiorganosiloxane and filler., The product quality obtained is just as good as when degassing is carried out after all constituents have been mixed.<br>
The third step can therefore make use of simple mixing apparatuses which have a low volume and are easy to clean by purging.<br>
The a,o-dihydroxypolydiorganosiloxane prefer<br>
ably has the formula (I)	t_<br>
HO-[R2SiO]m-H	(I) ,<br>
where<br>
R are monovalent C1-C8-hydrocarbon radicals which may be substituted by fluoro, chloro, bromo, C1-C4-alkoxyalkyl or cyano groups and<br>
m   has  a value  such  that  the  a, ©-dihydroxypoly-<br>
diorganosiloxane has a viscosity of from 0.05 to<br>
1<br>
1000 Pa.s.<br>
Examples of hydrocarbon radicals R are linear and cyclic saturated and unsaturated alkyl radicals such as the methyl radical, aryl radicals such as the phenyl radical, alkaryl radicals such as tolyl radicals and aralkyl radicals such as the benzyl radical.<br>
Preferred radicals R are unsubstituted hydrocarbon radicals having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, with<br><br>
particular  preference  being  given  to \ tne  mecnyi radical.<br>
The a, co-dihydroxypolydiorganosiloxanes preferably have a viscosity of from 100 to 700,000 mPa.s, in particular from 20,000 to 350,000 mPa.s, in each case measured at 23°C.<br>
Examples of fillers which are mixed into the RTV-1 compositions are non-reinforcing fillers,  i.e. fillers having a BET surface area of up to 50 m2/g, e.g.  quartz,   chalk,  diatomaceous  earth,   calcium silicate,  zirconium silicate,  zeolites,' metal  oxide powders  such as  aluminum,  titanium,  iron and zinc oxides or their mixed oxides, barium sulfate, calcium carbonate,  gypsum,  silicon nitride,  silicon carbide, boron nitride, glass powder and polyirier powder, e.g. polyacrylonitrile  powder;  reinforcing  fillers,  i.e. fillers having a BET surface area of more than 50 m2/g, e.g.  pyrogenic  silica,  precipitated silica,  carbon black such as furnace black and acetylene black and silicon-aluminum mixed oxides of high BET surface area; and fibrous  fillers such as asbestos or synthetic fibers.<br>
The fillers mentioned can be hydrophobicized, for example by treatment with organosilanes or organosiloxanes or with stearic acid or by etheri-fication of hydroxyl groups to form alkoxy groups. It is possible to use one type of filler, but a mixture of at least two fillers can also be used.<br>
As crosslinkers, preference is given to using silanes having groups which can be condensed with the hydroxyl groups of the a, (O-dihydroxypolydiorgano-siloxane, and also oligomeric condensation products of these silanes. Crosslinkers used are particularly preferably silanes of the formula (II)<br><br>
R1 are monovalent C1-C10-nyarocaroon radicals which may be substituted by fluoro, chloro, bromo, C1-C4-alkoxyalkyl, amino-Ci-C6-alkyl, amino-C1-C6-alkyl-enamino or cyano groups,<br>
X   are hydrogen, fluorine, chlorine or bromine atoms,<br>
C1-C4-alkoxy,  C1-C4-acyloxy,  amino,  C1-C4-alkyl-<br>
amino, C1-C4~dialkylamino, C1-C6-alkylamido,  (N-Ci-<br>
C4-alkyl) -C1-C6-alkylamido or Si-0-N=-bonded C3-C6-<br>
,    ketoximo groups and<br>
n   is 0, 1 or 2.<br>
Examples of condensation catalysts which accelerate the condensation of the crosslinker with the a,co-dihydroxypolydiorganosiloxane are amines, organic compounds of tin, zinc, zirconium,' titanium and aluminum. Among these condensation catalysts, preference is given to butyl titanates and organic tin compounds such as di-n-butyltin diacetate, di-n-butyltin dilaurate and reaction products of a silane having, per molecule, at least two monovalent hydrocarbon radicals acting as hydrolyzable groups which are bound to silicon via oxygen and may be substituted by an alkoxy group, or an oligomer of this silane, with a diorganotin diacylate, where all valences of the tin atoms in these reaction products are occupied by oxygen atoms of the group =SiOSnn or by SnC-bonded, monovalent organic radicals.<br>
In the preparation of the RTV-1 compositions, it is possible to use additional constituents,  for example coloring constituents  such as pigments  and soluble dyes,  fragrances,  plasticizers such as tri-methylsiloxy-terminated dimethyIpolysiloxanes which are liquid at room temperature or organic plasticizers, fungicides,  resin-like  organopolysiloxanes  including those comprising  (CH3)3SiOi/2 and Si04/2 units,  purely organic resins such as homopolymers or copolymers of acrylonitrile,  styrene,  vinyl chloride or propylene, where  such  purely  organic  resins,  in  particular copolymers of styrene and n-butylacrylate,  can have<br><br>
been produced by polymerization of the monomers mentioned by means of free radicals in the presence of a diorganopolysiloxane having an Si-bonded hydroxy group in each of the end units, corrosion inhibitors, polyglycols which may be esterified and/or etherified, oxidation inhibitors, heat stabilizers, solvents, materials for influencing the electrical properties, e.g. conductive carbon black, flame retardants, light stabilizers and agents for extending the skin formation time, e.g. silanes having SiC-bonded mercaptoalkyl radicals, and cell-generating agents, e. g'. azbdicarbon-amide. Likewise, it is possible to add coupling agents, preferably amino-functional silanes.    /<br>
Suitable mixers for preparing the raw mixture in the first step are continuous closed mechanical mixers, in particular a mixing turbine through which material flows axially or kneaders such as single- or twin-screw kneaders, for example reciprocating kneaders. If a kneader is used, it does not have to have a venting facility such as vacuum points.<br>
Suitable mixers for the second step are preferably the kneaders as described for the first step but which have a venting facility and are operated under reduced pressure or degassing apparatuses. The internal pressure is preferably not more than 10 kPa.<br>
Suitable mixers in the third step are preferably static mixers and dynamic mechanical mixers.<br>
The first step can be divided into two or more sub-steps. For example, a premix of a, (O-dihydroxy-polydiorganosiloxane, crosslinker and plasticizer can be prepared in a first mixer and then be mixed with filler in a second mixer to produce the raw mixture. The raw mixture can also be prepared by metering the constituents a, co-dihydroxypolydiorganosiloxane and filler and also further constituents into the mixer at various points.<br>
The first and second steps can also be carried out in succession in a mixer having a relatively long construction.  For example,  the raw mixture can be<br><br>
prepared in the front region of a screw kneader and then be degassed under reduced pressure in the downstream region of the kneader.<br>
In the second step, nonvolatile constituents, for example a metal salt, can be mixed in as condensation catalyst during degassing.<br>
In the third step, coupling agents and, if desired, coloring constituents and also either cross-linker or catalyst which is still absent are preferably mixed in.<br>
In the examples described below,' all percentages are by weight unless otherwise specified. Furthermore, all viscosities are at a temperature of 25°C.<br>
