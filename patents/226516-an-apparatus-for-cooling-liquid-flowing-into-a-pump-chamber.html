				<td>The invention relates to an operations building<br>
for a plant, in particular for a power-generation<br>
plant, which has a pump chamber and a cleaning chamber<br>
for cooling water. The invention also relates to a<br>
" method of operating the operations building.<br>
In an industrial plant, in particular in a<br>
power station for generating power, cooling water is<br>
necessary for operating the plant. A typical example<br>
for the use of cooling water is the cooling of steam in<br>
a cooling tower of a power station. In this case, the<br>
cooling water is generally removed from a natural<br>
reservoir, for example from a river or lake, and first<br>
of all cleaned in the cleaning chamber in order then to<br>
be sent to plant components via the pump chamber, by a<br>
pump arranged therein. In large-scale plants, the<br>
delivery capacity of the pumping system is a number of<br>
cubic meters of cooling water per second. The flow<br>
paths, the cleaning arrangements for cleaning the<br>
cooling water, the pump chamber and, in particular, the<br>
pump are of correspondingly voluminous design. The<br>
behavior of the cooling liquid flowing into the pump is<br>
decisive for reliable and permanent disruption-free<br>
operation of the pump. In particular an as far as<br>
possible vortex-free flow into the pump is necessary<br>
for this purpose.<br>
In terms of design, the cleaning chamber and<br>
the outlet cross section thereof are usually very<br>
narrow and high, whereas the pump chamber, which is<br>
arranged downstream of the cleaning chamber in terms of<br>
flow, is wide and flat and designed, for example, as a<br>
covered pump chamber. These extremely different chamber<br>
geometries and internals in the cleaning chamber, or<br>
downstream of the same as seen in the flow direction,<br><br>
cause turbulence in the cooling liquid. In order to<br>
prevent said turbulence or vortices resulting in the<br>
formation of surface or base vortices which are<br>
disruptive for the pump, a calming section is usually<br>
provided between the cleaning chamber and the pump<br>
chamber. Said calming section requires a not<br>
inconsiderable amount of space, which adversely affects<br>
the costs during the production of the operations<br>
building.<br>
The book by Lueger "Lexikon der Technik"<br>
[Lexicon of technology] 4th edition; volume 6; Lexikon<br>
der Energietechnik und Kraftmaschinen [Lexicon of power<br>
engineering and prime movers], A-K, edited by Rudolf<br>
von Miller, Deutsche Verlags-Anstalt GmbH, Stuttgart,<br>
1965, pages 666-667 and pages 669-670, discloses an<br>
operations building for a power-generation plant. The<br>
operations building has a pump chamber for arranging a<br>
pump for cooling water and also a cleaning chamber. The<br>
operations building is designed as an intake structure<br>
on a free body of water with a number of intake<br>
chambers such that the water flows to the individual<br>
intake chambers uniformly and as far as possible in a<br>
vortex-free manner, and that the bottom of the body of<br>
water is not swirled up or adversely affected by the<br>
inflowing water.<br>
The object of the invention is to specify an<br>
operations building for a plant, and a method of<br>
operating an operations building, which ensure reliable<br>
plant operation with low plant-production costs.<br>
The operations-building-related object is<br>
achieved according to the invention by said operations<br>
building having a pump chamber for arranging a pump for<br>
cooling water and also a cleaning chamber, the pump<br>
chamber directly adjoining the cleaning chamber and<br>
having such a chamber geometry that, during operation<br>
of the plant, the cooling liquid, in order to avoid<br>
disruptive vortices, has a high flow speed.<br><br>
The invention takes as its departure point here<br>
the surprising finding that the cleaning chamber may be<br>
arranged immediately in front of the pump chamber, that<br>
is to say that the conventional calming sections may be<br>
dispensed with without disruptive vortices, in<br>
particular surface vortices, occurring in the pump<br>
chamber. This is because the vortices can be avoided by<br>
an expedient geometrical configuration of the pump<br>
chamber which results in a comparatively high flow<br>
speed. This relationship between the flow speed and<br>
vortice formation is surprising since, up until now, it<br>
has been assumed that success is only achieved in<br>
precisely the opposite way, that is to say the lowest<br>
possible speed should be set in order to avoid<br>
vortices. The level of a sufficient flow speed depends<br>
on a number of factors, in particular also on the<br>
quantity of cooling liquid which is to be pumped. In<br>
industrial plants with a pumping capacity of a number<br>
of cubic meters per second, a flow speed of<br>
approximately 0.5 m/s has been provided up until now in<br>
the calming section. In order to avoid the vortices, a<br>
higher flow speed than this, in particular of<br>
approximately between 2-3 m/s, is set.<br>
The decisive advantage of this configuration is<br>
that the absence of the calming section results in the<br>
overall volume of the operations building being reduced<br>
and thus in the production costs for the operations<br>
building being reduced to a considerable extent.<br>
The chamber geometry is preferably configured<br>
such that, during operation, the flow speed of the<br>
cooling liquid is increased as it passes into the pump<br>
chamber.,<br>
In conventional plants and in the plant<br>
described here, the flow speeds for the cooling water<br>
within a cleaning machine arranged in the cleaning<br>
chamber are approximately 1 m/s. Whereas, in<br>
conventional<br><br>
plants, this flow speed is reduced to approximately<br>
0.5 m/s through the calming sections at the inflow to<br>
the pump chamber, the present embodiment, in contrast,<br>
provides an increase in the speed in order to form a<br>
sufficiently high flow speed.<br>
An intake opening via which the cooling water<br>
flows into the pump chamber is preferably adjoined by a<br>
wall region which runs obliquely in relation to the<br>
chamber side wall. This avoids backflow spaces in the<br>
pump chamber, which are a typical cause of the<br>
formation of vortices.<br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment, the<br>
pump chamber is designed for such positioning of the<br>
pump that, by the displacing action of a pump tube,<br>
separation of the flow from the wall is reliably<br>
prevented despite the usually large expansion angle in<br>
the inflow region of the pump chamber. This is<br>
preferably achieved in that, with the pump installed,<br>
the flow cross section for the cooling liquid flowing<br>
into the pump chamber tapers. It is possible here for<br>
the diameter of the pump tube to vary over a large<br>
range, with the result that both pumps with a small<br>
tube diameter and high impeller speed and pumps with a<br>
large tube diameter and low impeller speed can be<br>
inserted into the same chamber. The tube diameter and<br>
the impeller speeds are selected here so as to achieve<br>
a low-level so-called "necessary net positive suction<br>
head" (NPSH) for avoiding the so-called cavitation,<br>
that is to say the formation and the abrupt bursting of<br>
steam bubbles. For this purpose, in particular the<br>
distance between the axial center of the pump and the<br>
chamber rear wall and the distance between the base and<br>
the pump suction bell are designed as a function of the<br>
suction-bell diameter and of the size of the chamber.<br>
In order to avoid wall and base vortices and to<br>
achieve an acceptable speed profile in the pump tube,<br><br>
in preferred embodiments the pump chamber has as an<br>
alternative, and preferably in combination, the<br>
following features:<br>
a directing sill, running approximately<br>
perpendicularly to the inflow direction of the<br>
cooling water, on the chamber base in the region of<br>
the pump, said sill serving, in particular, for<br>
deflecting the flow in the direction of the pump;<br>
a longitudinal sill, arranged on the chamber base<br>
and running approximately in the direction of the<br>
inflow direction, as flow resistance for base<br>
vortices;<br>
a continuation of the longitudinal sill on the<br>
chamber rear wall as, in particular, a vertically<br>
running wall sill;<br>
a spacing of the wall sill from a chamber ceiling of<br>
the pump chamber, which is designed as a covered<br>
pump chamber, in order, for avoiding vortices, to<br>
ensure sufficient flow around the pump;<br>
the chamber side walls, as in the intake region,<br>
merge into the rear chamber walls via obliquely<br>
running wall regions.<br>
The chamber base is beveled in relation to the<br>
chamber rear wall.<br>
Longitudinal plates, running in particular<br>
perpendicularly to the chamber base, are arranged in<br>
the intake opening to the pump chamber.<br>
If required, the interior of the pump chamber is<br>
accessible from the outside via a flow-connection,<br>
which is used for further removal of cooling water<br>
or also for measuring coolant properties.<br>
Cooling-water removal is provided, for example, for<br>
extinguishing purposes or for temporary cleaning<br>
purposes by means of cooling water. To this end,<br>
pumps are usually arranged in the pump chamber or in<br>
the calming section. These act, however, as flow<br>
resistance and are often the cause of the formation<br>
of surface vortices. With the flow-connection via<br><br>
the chamber wall, there is no longer any need for<br>
the arrangement of such pumps in the interior.<br>
If use is made of so-called tubular type pumps, in<br>
which the pump tube is guided through a chamber<br>
ceiling of the pump chamber, it is possible,<br>
additionally or alternatively, for relatively large<br><br>
quantities of additional water to be withdrawn above<br>
the chamber ceiling. This water leaves the pump<br>
chamber through an annular gap between the pump tube<br>
and chamber ceiling.<br>
In addition to the specific provisions made in<br>
the pump chamber itself, preferred developments also<br>
provide for vortex-avoiding and flow-calming and<br>
flow-evening measures, which contribute to evening out<br>
the flow, to be taken in the cleaning chamber. For this<br>
purpose, the cleaning chamber, like the pump chamber,<br>
has obliquely running side walls in the intake region<br>
to the pump chamber. Furthermore, a cleaning<br>
arrangement is arranged preferably immediately in front<br>
of the intake opening of the pump chamber and fully<br>
encloses the same. Said cleaning arrangement preferably<br>
has a flow-directing plate on its side which is<br>
directed away from the pump chamber.<br>
An alternative embodiment is preferably formed<br>
by designing the pump as a concrete spiral casing pump,<br>
the concrete spiral casing forming the chamber ceiling<br>
of the pump chamber. The concrete spiral casing pump<br>
here preferably has a suction tube which projects into<br>
the pump chamber.<br>
In order to achieve the method-related object,<br>
the invention makes provision, in an operations<br>
building having a pump chamber and a pump for cooling<br>
water arranged therein, and having a cleaning chamber<br>
directly adjacent to the pump chamber, for the cooling<br>
water to be cleaned in the cleaning chamber and then to<br>
flow into the pump chamber at a high flow speed, this<br>
precluding the formation of any vortices which disrupt<br>
the operation of the pump.<br>
The advantages given in respect of the<br>
operations building and preferred embodiments can be<br>
transferred analogously to the method.<br><br>
Exemplary embodiments of the invention are<br>
explained in more detail hereinbelow with reference to<br>
the drawing in which, in schematic illustrations in<br>
each case:<br>
Figure 1 shows, in detail form, a lateral illustration<br>
in section through an operations building,<br>
Figure 2 likewise shows, in detail form, a lateral<br>
illustration in section through an operations<br>
building with a concrete spiral casing pump,<br>
and<br>
Figure 3 shows a plan view of a horizontal section<br>
through a pump chamber.<br>
According to figures 1 and 2, an operations<br>
building 2 for an, in particular, industrial plant, for<br>
example a power station for generating power, has a<br>
pump chamber 4 and a cleaning chamber 6, which are<br>
directly adjacent to one another via a common chamber<br>
wall 8. The cleaning chamber 6 and the pump chamber 4<br>
are in flow-connection with one another via an intake<br>
opening 10. The pump chamber 4 is designed as a<br>
so-called covered pump chamber and has a chamber<br>
ceiling 28. Arranged in the pump chamber 4 is a pump 14<br>
which is spaced apart from the chamber base 12 and has<br>
a pump tube 16. The latter is guided through the<br>
chamber ceiling 28, an annular gap 29 being formed in<br>
the process. In the pump chamber 4, a suction bell 17<br>
adjoins the pump tube 16 on the end side. Unlike the<br>
conventional separate pump 14 according to figure 1,<br>
the pump according to figure 2 is designed as a<br>
concrete spiral casing pump 14a. The latter has a<br>
concrete spiral casing which is formed by concrete<br>
components 19 positioned in the building structure or<br>
by the building structure itself. From the concrete<br>
spiral casing pump 14a, a suction tube 20, with suction<br>
bell 17 provided on the end side, extends into the pump<br>
chamber A, with the result that the suction bell 17 is<br>
at a level which is favorable for operation.<br><br>
Arranged in the cleaning chamber 6, immediately<br>
in front of the intake opening 10 and covering over the<br>
latter completely, is a cleaning arrangement<br><br>
for the cooling water in the form of a filter or of a<br>
screening arrangement 22. It is designed, in<br>
particular, as a so-called belt screen machine. The<br>
latter has a circulating belt screen with a plurality<br>
of screen surfaces 24, which serve for cleaning cooling<br>
water in the region of the intake opening 10 and are<br>
cleaned in the top region of the belt screen machine,<br>
for example, by jets. The screening arrangement 22<br>
preferably has further cleaning arrangements (not<br>
illustrated specifically) arranged upstream of it.<br>
The cooling water is usually removed from an<br>
natural reservoir, passes, via an inflow opening 26,<br>
into the cleaning chamber 6, is cleaned there and is<br>
then taken in through the intake opening 10 into the<br>
pump chamber 4 by the pump 14. The operations building<br>
2 is arranged, in relation to the water level of the<br>
reservoir, such that, with a natural fluctuation of the<br>
water level between a high water level H and a low<br>
water level N, the suction bell 17, that is to say the<br>
inflow region of the pump 14, is sufficiently covered<br>
over with cooling water. This is because, if the<br>
covering-over level is too low, the quality of the flow<br>
in the pump tube 16 is impaired. This applies, in<br>
particular, when the water level drops below the<br>
chamber ceiling 28. This situation is thus admissible<br>
only for specific operating cases and for a limited<br>
period of time, for example during start-up of the pump<br>
14, when the water is fed to the operations building 2<br>
through a long channel or a long pipeline. A<br>
sufficiently high covering-over level, in addition,<br>
helps to avoid the so-called cavitation, that is to say<br>
the formation and abrupt bursting of steam bubbles to<br>
form a pressure wave which adversely affects the<br>
material. The illustrated design of the pump chamber 4<br>
as a covered pump chamber with the chamber ceiling 28<br>
counteracts the production of surface vortices.<br>
The specific provisions made in order to avoid<br>
vortices are explained hereinbelow with reference to<br>
figures 1 and 3. As can be gathered from figure 3, the<br><br><br>
wall region 30, which adjoins the intake opening 10,<br>
runs<br><br>
obliquely in relation to the chamber side wall 32<br>
which, in turn, merges into the chamber rear wall 34<br>
via a rear, oblique wall region 30a. Arranged on the<br>
chamber base 12 is a directing sill 36 and a<br>
longitudinal sill 38, which have a triangular<br>
cross-sectional surface and are arranged in relation to<br>
one another to form a cross. In this case, the<br>
longitudinal sill 38 runs in the inflow direction 40 of<br>
the cooling water. The directing sill 36 serves<br>
primarily for deflecting the cooling liquid into the<br>
pump 14.. For this purpose, as can be gathered from<br>
figure 1, it is preferably arranged some way in front<br>
of the pump axis 42. The directing sill 36 and the<br>
longitudinal sill 38 may have the same profile or<br>
different profiles and/or different dimensions. The<br>
longitudinal sill 38 serves for preventing base<br>
vortices. It is continued in a wall sill 44, which<br>
extends vertically upwards on the chamber rear wall 34<br>
but is spaced apart from the chamber ceiling 28 in<br>
order to allow sufficient flow of cooling liquid around<br>
the pump 14. The wall sill 44 serves essentially for<br>
easier deflection of the flowing cooling liquid to the<br>
pump.<br>
In the rear region of the pump chamber 4, the<br>
chamber base 12 is beveled in relation to the rear wall<br>
regions 30a and to the chamber rear wall 34 via a<br>
corner compensating means 46, which is illustrated by<br>
dashed lines in figure 1. This serves for improving the<br>
deflection of the base flow and reduces the degree of<br>
turbulence of the flow in this region. In general<br>
terms, the pump chamber 4 is distinguished in that,<br>
despite the use of planar boundary surfaces, it does<br>
not change the flow abruptly and this, despite the<br>
unusually high speed, achieves a low degree of<br>
turbulence in the pump tube 16. By virtue of the<br>
arrangement of bevels in the critical regions, the pump<br>
chamber 4 may thus be referred to as being largely<br>
edge-free. The typical flow paths of the cooling liquid<br>
are illustrated in the figures by dashed arrow lines. A<br><br>
corner compensating means in the base region of the<br>
intake opening 10 is dispensed with according to<br>
figure 1 since, there, a stable flow vortex 48 forms of<br>
its own accord,<br><br>
said flow vortex acting as a so-called "hydraulic ball<br>
bearing" in the manner of a stable roller, with the<br>
result that the rest of the flow flows over the flow<br>
vortex 48 in an essentially unaffected manner. The flow<br>
vortex 48 may be reduced, for example, by moderate<br>
beveling of the base region of the intake opening 10.<br>
In particular the oblique front wall region 30<br>
avoids separation of the flow from the chamber wall.<br>
This is achieved not least by the displacement action<br>
of the pump tube 14, which is decisively determined by<br>
the size and the position of the pump 14 in relation to<br>
the wall regions 30. In particular there is a reduction<br>
in the flow cross section for the cooling liquid<br>
following the intake opening 10, with the result that<br>
there is an increase in the flow speed. This prevents<br>
separation of the flow and thus already helps to avoid<br>
vortices. On account of the high speed of the flow, in<br>
addition, the situation where no in particular<br>
stationary flow vortices form on the surface is<br>
achieved in a straightforward and reliable manner. This<br>
is because such stationary flow vortices only form<br>
stably when there is sufficiently calm flow. Herein<br>
resides precisely the essential feature of the chamber<br>
geometry by means of which such comparatively calm flow<br>
is avoided. With the normal water level Nr the chamber<br>
ceiling 28 results in an improvement in the speed<br>
distribution in the pump tube 16.<br>
In order effectively to prevent disruptions<br>
from the screening arrangement 22 in the particularly<br>
critical region in the transition between the cleaning<br>
chamber 6 and pump chamber 4, in this case longitudinal<br>
plates 50, which are aligned essentially perpendicular<br>
to the chamber base 12, are provided. For a suitable<br>
flow guidance, in addition, the side walls 52 of the<br>
cleaning chamber 6 are beveled in relation to the<br>
intake opening 10. Furthermore, at its end which is<br>
directed away from the intake opening 10, the screening<br>
arrangement 22 has<br><br>
flow-directing plates 54 which are arranged on the<br>
borders on the front side of the screening arrangement<br>
22 in a rectilinear manner or at an oblique angle in<br>
relation to said screening arrangement.<br>
In the chamber wall 8, preferably in the region<br>
of the wall region 30, flow-connections 56 to the<br>
interior of the pump chamber 4 are provided. Cooling<br>
water may be removed from the pump chamber 4 via said<br>
connections without pumps which adversely affect the<br>
coolant flow having to be introduced into the interior<br>
of the pump chamber 4. Via the flow-connection 56, it<br>
is also possible to take measurements, such as a<br>
filling-level measurement, without the flow in the pump<br>
chamber 4 being affected. Alternatively or<br>
additionally, in the exemplary embodiment according to<br>
figure 1, that is to say with the use of a so-called<br>
tubular type pump, it is possible to remove a<br>
relatively large quantity of cooling water. In this<br>
case, the cooling water flows through the annular gap<br>
29 between the chamber ceiling 28 and pump tube 16.<br>
The formation both of base vortices and of<br>
surface vortices is reliably avoided by the measures<br>
described above. The decisive factor for this is the<br>
high speed in the pump chamber 4. In addition to the<br>
essential advantage of dispensing with the calming<br>
section, the pump chamber 4, in addition, can be<br>
operated reliably with the pump 14 being covered over<br>
by cooling water to a comparatively low extent. This is<br>
because the risk of surface vortices forming is<br>
considerably reduced in relation to conventional<br>
configurations. Even if the water level falls below the<br>
low water level N to a reduced water level R, which<br>
occurs under some circumstances, for example, during<br>
start-up and may drop below the level of the chamber<br>
ceiling 28, the cooling-water flow in the pump chamber<br>
4 is sufficiently stable. The necessary covering-over<br>
level is thus determined essentially just by the<br>
cavitation problem. On account of the reduced<br>
covering-over level, the necessary overall height of<br><br>
the operations building 2 is reduced,<br><br>
with the result that the production costs can be kept<br>
low.<br><br>

interior of the pump chamber is accessible via a flow-connection.<br>
10.	The apparatus as claimed in claim 1, wherein the pump<br>
chamber comprises a chamber celling through which a pump tube is<br>
guided, an annular gap being formed in the process, with the<br>
result being that cooling water can be withdrawn from the pump<br>
chamber via the annular gap.<br>
11.	The apparatus as claimed in claim 1, wherein the<br>
cleaning chamber comprises obliquely running side wails in the<br>
region oriented toward the pump chamber.<br><br>
12.	The apparatus as claimed in claim 1, wherein in the<br>
cleaning chamber a cleaning arrangement is arranged immediately<br>
in front of the intake opening.<br>
13.	The apparatus as claimed in claim 12, wherein a flow-<br>
directing plate is provided on the cleaning arrangement.<br>
14.	the apparatus as claimed in claim 1, wherein the pump<br>
is designed as a concrete spiral casing pump, the concrete spiral<br>
casing forming a chamber celling of the pump chamber.<br>
15. The apparatus as claimed in claim 1, wherein the<br>
cooling liquid flow speed is controlled in order to avoid<br>
disruptive vortices.<br>
16. The apparatus as claimed in claim 15, wherein a chamber<br>
base of the pump chamber comprises a directing sill, running<br>
approximately perpendicularly to the inflow direction of the<br>
cooling liquid, in a region of the pump for deflecting the flow<br>
in the direction of the pump.<br>
17. The apparatus as claimed in claim 15, wherein a chamber<br>
base of the pump chamber comprises a longitudinal sill, running<br>
approximatly in the direction of the inflow direction of the<br>
cooling water, as flow resistance for base vortices.<br>
18. ihe apparatus as claimed in claim 17, wherein the<br>
longitudinal sill is continued on a rear wall of the pump chamber<br>
as a wall sill.<br><br>
19.	The apparatus as claimed in claim 6, wherein the<br>
chamber base in a rear region of the pump chamber is beveled in<br>
relation to the chamber wail.<br>
20.	The apparatus as claimed in claim 15, wherein, in the<br>
cleaning chamber, a cleaning arrangement is arranged immediately<br>
in front of an intake opening to the pump chamber.<br>
21.	The apparatus as claimed in claim 20, wherein a flow<br>
directing plate is provided on the cleaning arrangement.<br><br>
The inventive apparatus comprises a purification<br>
chamber (6) and a pump chamber (4) with a pump (14) for cooling<br>
water. Said pump chamber directly adjoins the purification<br>
chamber (6) and the geometry of the pump chamber is such that<br>
disturbing swirls are avoided while the installation is in<br>
operation, due to the high speed of the coolant. The direct<br>
proximity of the two chambers to each other results in lower cost<br>
due to the elimiantion of the usual steading zones.</td>
