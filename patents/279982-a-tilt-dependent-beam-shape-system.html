				<td>Technical Held<br>
The present invention relates to a system for adapting the beam-shape of an<br>
antenna in a wireless communication network.<br>
Background<br>
Variable beam tilt is an important tool for optimizing radio access networks<br>
for cellular telephony and data communications. By varying the main beam<br>
pointing direction of the base station antenna, both interference environment<br>
and cell coverage area can be controlled.<br>
Variable electrical beam tilt is conventionally performed by adding a variable<br>
linear phase shift to the excitation of the antenna elements, or groups of<br>
elements, by means of some phase-shifting device. For cost reasons, this<br>
phase-shifting device should be as simple and contain as few components as<br>
possible. It is therefore often realized using some kinds of variable delay<br>
lines. In the description, the terms "linear" and "non-linear" should be<br>
understood to refer to relative phase over multiple secondary ports of a<br>
multiport phase shifting network, and not the time or phase behaviour of a<br>
port in itself.<br>
Conventional multi-port phase shifters, with one primary port and a number<br>
N (N&gt;1) secondary ports, are implemented with linear progressive variable<br>
phase taper over the secondary ports. In addition to the linear progressive<br>
phase taper, fixed amplitude and phase tapers are often used as a means for<br>
generating a tapered nominal secondary port distribution.<br>
Figures la and 1b illustrate a conventional phase shifter 10, with one<br>
primary port 11, and the phase shifter generates in down-link linear<br>
progressive phase shifts over four secondary ports 121 -124. A variable-angle<br>
"delay board" 13 has multiple trombone lines 14, one for each secondary<br>
port 121-124. The trombones lines 14 are arranged at linearly progressive<br>
 <br>
radii. By a proper choice of junction configurations, line lengths, and line<br>
impedance values, the nominal phase and amplitude taper of the phase<br>
shifter can be controlled, for example to achieve uniform phase over the<br>
secondary ports as indicated by "0" in Figure la. By changing the delay line<br>
lengths (i.e. the length of the trombone lines 14), in this case by rotation of<br>
the delay board 13 relative to a fixed board 15, the secondary ports 121-124<br>
experience linear progressive phase shifts as indicated in Figure lb. In up-<br>
link, the secondary ports 121-124 receive signals from an antenna (not<br>
shown) which are combined within the phase shifter to a common receive<br>
signal at the primary port 11.<br>
The use of non-linear phase-shifting devices for controlling electrical down<br>
tilt has been contemplated, such as mentioned in US 5,798,675, by Drach,<br>
US 5,801,600, by Butland et al.<br>
A system for tilt-dependent beam shaping using conventional linear phase<br>
shifters is disclosed in JP 2004 229220. The system has different beam<br>
width depending on the tilt angle, but this is achieved by a tilt angle control<br>
section (41) in combination with a vertical beam width control section (42) in<br>
the base station controller (4), see figure 6 in JP 2004 229220.<br>
Traditionally, base station antennas have had a variable beam tilt range of<br>
approximately one beamwidth. This together with the fact that most mobile<br>
connections today are circuit switched voice with a fixed requirement on bit-<br>
rates, has not triggered any interest in improving the Signal-to-interference +<br>
noise ratio (SINR) close to the antenna. Normally it is good enough.<br>
For particular cell configurations, e.g. highly placed antennas in combination<br>
with small cells, the need for using antennas with large beam tilt is greater.<br>
For antennas with conventional narrow elevation beam radiation patterns,<br>
the large beam tilt causes users close to the base station to experience a<br>
lower path gain than users close to the cell border, since the difference in<br>
path loss for the near and far users is smaller than the difference in directive<br>
antenna gain. For packet-based data communication this is not optimal<br>
 <br>
usage of the available power. Therefore, for antennas with large beam tilt,<br>
some degree of radiation pattern null-fill below the main beam, or even some<br>
cosec-like beam-shaping is desirable.<br>
In large cells, on the other hand, when no or small beam tilt is employed, the<br>
antenna pattern should be optimized for maximum peak gain. The path gain<br>
for the users at the cell border will anyway be smaller than for users closer<br>
to the base station because the path loss varies rapidly with vertical<br>
observation angle in the case of large cells and observation angles close to<br>
the horizon.<br>
Summary<br>
An object with the present invention is to provide a system that allows a<br>
radiation pattern of an antenna to be optimized both for high maximum gain<br>
at small tilt angles, and high degree of null filling below the main beam at<br>
large tilt angles.<br>
A solution to the object is achieved by providing a system for changing the<br>
beam shape of an antenna, preferably having multiple antenna elements<br>
arranged in an array, in dependency of a tilt angle. Electric tilting is achieved<br>
by including a phase-shifting device that will provide phase shifts over<br>
secondary ports from the phase-shifting device. A phase-taper device<br>
provides changed phase taper over the antenna elements with tilt angle.<br>
An advantage with the present invention is that a single antenna may be<br>
used in an adaptive system, to fulfil the need for increasing the quality of a<br>
communication link and thus increase the bit rate associated with one or<br>
more simultaneous users, by maintaining an optimal antenna pattern,<br>
which depends on the distance to the base station.<br>
Further objects and advantages will become apparent for a skilled person<br>
from the detailed description.<br>

Detailed description<br>
A base station, including an antenna with multiple antenna elements, is<br>
arranged within a cell, where the characteristics of the antenna determine<br>
the size of the cell and the cell coverage area all else being equal. To<br>
accomplish the same signal strength in the entire cell, independent of the<br>
distance to the base station, the antenna gain G(O) divided by the path loss<br>
L{&amp;) should be constant in the cell, as a function of observation angle 9:<br>
<br>
However, the constant C changes with cell configuration, i.e. antenna<br>
installation height and cell size, which in turn means that the optimal<br>
 <br>
antenna radiation pattern changes with beam tilt angle, as illustrated in<br>
figures 7b-7d, lines 71. The tilt dependent radiation pattern can be<br>
accomplished by changing the phase taper over the antenna with tilt-angle,<br>
e.g. by providing a non-linear phase shifter as described in connection with<br>
Figures 2a, 2b, 3b and 4. The non-linear phase shifter facilitates different<br>
phase tapers for different beam tilt angles, and thus will provide tilt-<br>
dependent beam shape of the antenna.<br>
The terms "phase shift" and "time delay" are used interchangeably in the<br>
following description and it should be understood that these terms refer to<br>
equivalent properties in the present context, except if otherwise noted.<br>
An essential part of the invention is to provide non-linear phase taper over<br>
the secondary ports of a phase shifter network. A method for achieving this<br>
is to use a multi-secondary port true time delay network in which the<br>
relative delay line lengths are, in general, non-linearly progressive. A true<br>
time delay network generates frequency-dependent phase shifts, a property<br>
which makes it particularly suitable for antenna applications, such as beam-<br>
steering.<br>
The principle idea of a first embodiment of a non-linear phase shifter 20, in<br>
down-link, is illustrated in Figures 2a and 2b using a true time delay<br>
network, similar to the one illustrated in Figures la and 1b. The key<br>
property of the delay network (and the method as such) is to provide non-<br>
linear relative time delays over the secondary ports, by arranging trombone<br>
lines 24 (in this particular embodiment) in a non-periodic fashion on a delay<br>
board 23. By a proper choice of junction configurations, line lengths, and<br>
line impedance values, the nominal phase and amplitude taper of the true<br>
time delay network with non-linear delay dependence can be controlled, for<br>
example to achieve uniform phase over the secondary ports as indicated by<br>
"0" at the secondary ports 121-124 in Figure 2a. In contrast with the true<br>
time delay network in Figure 1, changes in the delay line lengths by rotation<br>
of the delay board relative to a fixed board 25 produces non-linear<br>
 <br>
progressive time delays (and, hence, phase shifts) over the secondary ports<br>
121-124, as indicated by "cpi", "cp2w, "q&gt;3*, and "q&gt;4* in Figure 2b. In up-link, the<br>
secondary ports 121-124 of the phase shifter 20 receive signals from an<br>
antenna (not shown) which are non-linearly time-delayed and combined<br>
within the phase shifter to a common receive signal at the primary port 11.<br>
As a non-limiting example, the phase-shifts from a linear and a non-linear<br>
true time delay network in down-link are compared in Figures 3a and 3b for<br>
different rotations (see legend) of the delay board 13 and 23, respectively. In<br>
Figure 3a, the phase advance (relative phase) over the secondary ports 12i-<br>
124 is linear with delay board 13 rotation, which manifests itself as straight<br>
lines 30, 31, 32 and 33 for a given board rotation. This means that for any<br>
given delay board rotation, the relative phase values (between secondary port<br>
n and port 1) are<br>
Acpn = (n-1) Aq&gt; = (n-l)ka,<br>
where n is the secondary port number, a is the board rotation angle, and k<br>
is a constant that depends on implementation aspects, for example wave<br>
number of transmission lines and radial separation of the trombones 14.<br>
The non-linear phase advance (relative phase) over the secondary ports 12i-<br>
124 of a non-linear true time delay network is illustrated in Figure 3b. In<br>
Figure 3b, the phase advance (relative phase) over the secondary ports 121-<br>
124 is non-linear when rotating the delay board 23, which manifests itself as<br>
one straight line 35 for 0° rotation and three non-straight lines 36, 37 and<br>
38 for a given board rotation / 0°. Thus, the relative phase values are not<br>
identical, i.e.,<br>
q&gt;n-<pn-i cpn for at least one n n-l></pn-i>
wherein N is the number of delay branches. In figure 3b, the phase of delay<br>
branch 3 varies faster than twice that of branch 2 when the board angle<br>
changes.<br>
 <br>
Figure 4 shows a second embodiment of a non-linear phase shifter 40. This<br>
delay line network is based on translation {rather than rotation) of the delay-<br>
board 43 relative a fixed board 45.. The delay network trombone lines 44 are<br>
shown with equal lengths, but they could also have different lengths (both<br>
the lines on the delay board 43 and the lines on the fixed board 45).<br>
Figure 5 shows an element excitation of a 15 element linear antenna array,<br>
optimized for maximum gain and a suppression of the upper sidelobes to<br>
-20dB. This element excitation produces the radiation pattern in Figure 7a,<br>
i.e. 0° beam tilt. In prior art techniques, linearly progressive phase is added<br>
to the phase taper shown in figure 5 to achieve different tilt angles, 8lltt.<br>
Figure 6 shows the element excitation for 9° beam tilt, where the amplitude<br>
taper is the same as for 0° beam tilt, but the phase taper has been optimized<br>
for null-filling, in accordance with the present invention. This excitation<br>
produces the radiation pattern with 9° beam tilt in Figure 7d.<br>
For beam tilt angles between 0° and 9°, the phase excitation is found by a<br>
linear interpolation of the phase excitations at 0° and 9°. Some of these<br>
radiation patterns 70 are shown in Figures 7b and 7c, with the beam tilt<br>
changing 3° for each subplot. For comparison, the relative path loss 71,<br>
normalized at beam peak, is shown in the same plots. The relative path loss<br>
changes with beam tilt angle 9slj,.<br>
The invention is not limited to the example with constant cell illumination<br>
described above, but is applicable in all cases where it is desirable, for one<br>
reason or another, to have a radiation pattern that changes with beam tilt<br>
angle. Furthermore, the invention is not limited to linear antenna arrays, but<br>
may also be implemented in a base station having a non-linear antenna<br>
array.<br>
The present invention allows the antenna pattern to be optimized both for<br>
high maximum gain at small tilt angles, and for good coverage (high degree<br>
of null filling) close to the antenna at large tilt angles 9llh.<br>
 <br>
Figure 8 shows a wireless telecommunication system 80, exemplified using<br>
GSM standard, including a first base station BSi. The first base station BSi<br>
is connected via a first base station controller BSCi to a core network 81 of<br>
the telecommunication system 80. A uniform linear antenna array 83<br>
comprises in this embodiment six antenna elements 84. Secondary ports 12<br>
of a non-linear phase shifter 85 is connected to each antenna element 84 of<br>
the uniform linear antenna array 83, and a primary port 11 of the phase<br>
shifter 85 is connected to the first base station BSi. The first base station<br>
controller BSCi controls the variable beam tilt by changing the position of a<br>
non-linear delay board, as previously described in connection with figures<br>
2a, 2b and 4, and thereby altering the beam shape of a beam from the<br>
uniform linear antenna array 83.<br>
The telecommunication system 80 also includes a second base station BSa-<br>
The second base station BS2 is connected via a second base station<br>
controller BSC2 to the core network 81. A non-uniform linear antenna array<br>
88 comprises in this embodiment four antenna elements 84, not necessarily<br>
cross polarized as illustrated. Secondary ports 12 of a linear phase shifter 10<br>
{prior art) are connected, via a phase-taper device 87 that changes the phase<br>
taper over the antenna elements with tilt angle 0liU, to each antenna<br>
elements 84 of the non-linear antenna array 88. A primary port 11 of the<br>
phase shifter 10 is connected to the second base station BS2. The second<br>
base station controller BSC2 controls the variable beam tilt by changing the<br>
position of a linear delay board, as previously described in connection with<br>
figures la and lb, and thereby altering the beam shape of a beam from the<br>
non-uniform linear antenna array 88.<br>
It should be noted that the antenna array may have uniformly, or non-<br>
uniformly, arranged antenna elements 84, and cross polarized antenna<br>
elements are only shown as a non-limiting example and other types of<br>
antenna elements may naturally be used without deviating from the scope of<br>
the invention. Furthermore, antenna elements operating in different<br>
 <br>
frequency bands may be interleaved without departing from the scope of the<br>
claims.<br>
The illustrated telecommunication system (GSM) should be considered as a<br>
non-limiting example, and other wireless telecommunication standards,<br>
such as WCDMA, WiMAX, WiBro, CDMA2000, etc. may implement the<br>
described invention without deviating from the scope of the invention. Some<br>
of the described parts of the GSM system, e.g. base station controller BSC1<br>
and BSC2 may be omitted in certain telecommunication standards, which is<br>
obvious for a skilled person in the art.<br>
Figure 9 illustrates an antenna array 83 arranged in an elevated position,<br>
such as in a mast 90. A non-linear phase shifter 85 is connected to the<br>
antenna array 83 (as described in connection with figure 8) and is controlled<br>
by a base station controller BSC1. A non-tilted beam 91 (corresponding to<br>
the 0° plot in figure 7a) is illustrated in figure 9 together with a tilted beam<br>
92 (corresponding to the 9° plot in figure 7d).<br>
Although the invention has been described in detail using down-link, the<br>
skilled person in the art may readily adapt the teachings for up-link, as is<br>
mentioned above.<br>
