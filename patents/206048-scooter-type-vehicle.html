COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10]<br>
"SCOOTER TYPE VEHICLE"<br><br><br>
HONDA GIKEN KOGYO KABUSHIKI KAISHA, a corporation of Japan, having a place of business at 1-1, Minamiaoyama 2-chome, Minato-ku, Tokyo, Japan,<br><br><br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
[Detailed Description of the Invention]<br>
[Technical Field to which the Invention Pertains]<br>
This invention relates to a scooter type vehicle. [Prior Art]<br>
Among scooter type vehicles, a scooter type vehicle of a comparatively large size wherein an upper frame extends rearwardly downwards from a head pipe and a fuel tank is disposed along a lower face of the upper frame is available. As a scooter type vehicle of the type described, a "Motorcycle" of the official gazette of Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. Hei 10-203457 (hereinafter referred to as "prior art") is known.<br>
According to the prior art mentioned above, as<br>
2<br><br>
shown in FIG. 24 of the official gazette, from a lower portion of a head pipe 3 (the same reference character as that used in the official gazette is used. This similarly applies to the following description.), a main pipe 61 extends rearwardly downwards, and a pair of left and right down tubes 62, 62 extend downwardly from an upper portion of the head pipe 3 and lower ends of the down tubes 62, 62 are extended downwardly and coupled to the main pipe 61.  Front portions of the left and right down tubes 62, 62 extend downwardly such that they cross the main pipe 61 which extends along the center in the widthwise direction of the vehicle.<br>
Further, the prior art mentioned above relates to a scooter type vehicle wherein, as shown in FIGS. 4, 8 and 24 of the official gazette mentioned above, a space portion surrounded by the main pipe 61 (which corresponds to an upper frame) and the left and right down tubes 62, 62 is provided and a fuel tank 8 is disposed along the main pipe 61 and the down tubes 62, 62 in the space portion.<br>
Further scooter type vehicles include a scooter type vehicle of a comparatively large size on which a radiator for cooling an engine and a fuel tank of a large volume are carried.  In such a scooter type vehicle, a<br>
3<br><br>
layout wherein the radiator is disposed at a front portion of the vehicle body and an engine is disposed rearwardly of the radiator in order to raise the cooling efficiency of the radiator is adopted widely. Further, from the point of view of the space for disposition and so forth, the fuel tank of a large size is sometimes disposed in the neighborhood of the radiator or the engine. Where the fuel tank has such a relationship in disposition as just described, since it is influenced by heat from the radiator or the engine, a countermeasure against this is required. As a technique for preventing an influence of heat from an engine or a radiator, the official gazette of, for example, Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2000-229593 "Scooter Type Motorcycle" (hereinafter referred to as "prior art") is known.<br>
The prior art mentioned above relates to a motorcycle wherein, as shown in FIG. 2 of the above-specified official gazette, a radiator 26 (the reference numeral recited in the official gazette is cited.  This similarly applies in the following description) is disposed at a front portion of a vehicle body while an engine 20 is disposed at a rear portion of the vehicle body, and a fuel tank 30 is disposed between the radiator 26 and the engine 20.<br>
4<br><br>
Further, according to the prior art described above, as shown in FIGS. 2 to 4 of the official gazette specified above, a cylindrical fuel tank cover 40 closed up at an upper face thereof placed onto the fuel tank 30 from above, and in this state, the fuel tank 30 is attached to a body frame.  Due to the configuration, an influence of heat applied from the engine 20 or the radiator 26 to the fuel tank 30 can be prevented by the fuel tank cover 40.  The fuel tank cover 40 is a single body part molded from a soft resin.<br>
As an ignition coil disposition structure for a scooter type motorcycle, for example, the official gazette of Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 2000-310174 "Ignition Coil Unit Attaching Structure for a Swing Type Power Unit" is known.<br>
The technique described above is such that, according to FIGS. 1 and 2 of the official gazette specified above, a swing type power unit 21 is attached for swinging motion around a rocker shaft 92 of a body frame 11 side and an ignition coil unit 25 is attached forwardly of an engine 22 of the swing type power unit 21.<br>
As a body frame structure for a scooter type vehicle, for example, a "Scooter Type Vehicle" of the official gazette of Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. Hei 10-<br><br><br>
203460 is known.<br>
The technique described above is, according to FIG. 3 of the official gazette, a body frame 2 wherein left and right sub frames 55L and 55R extend from a head pipe 3; a front pipe 52 extends from the head pipe 3; left and right rear pipes 54L and 54R (hereinafter referred to as "rear frames") are connected to the front pipe 52 by a Y-shaped joint 53; rear ends of the sub frames 55L and 55R are connected to the rear pipes 54L and 54R, respectively; and a channel - shaped sub frame rear stay 64 (hereinafter referred to as "cross member") extends between the sub frames 55L and 55R (hereinafter referred to as "down frames") and the rear pipes 54L and 54R to reinforce them.<br>
[Problems to be Solved by the Invention]<br>
By the way, while, in the scooter type vehicle, the fuel tank 8 is disposed on a floor portion as shown in FIG. 8 of the official gazette of Japanese Patent Laid-open No. Hei 10-203457 of the prior art described above, if it is tried to reinforce the frame in order to raise the frame rigidity, then the space in which the fuel tank 8 is to be disposed is limited.  On the other hand, for the scooter type vehicle of a large size, high frame rigidity is required, and besides, in order to increase<br>
6<br><br>
the running distance, it is demanded to increase the<br>
capacity of the fuel tank as much as possible.<br>
Further, the fuel tank cover 40 of the scooter type<br>
motorcycle of the official gazette of Japanese Patent<br>
Laid-Open No.   2000-229593   is  a member  of  a large size<br>
because it covers the fuel tank 301  In order to mold a<br>
cover of such a large size as just described as a single<br>
member, a metal mold for molding of a large size is<br>
required, and this makes a factor of increase of the<br>
production cost.  Besides, it is not necessarily easy to<br>
produce the fuel tank cover 40 of a complicated shape<br>
conformina to the shape of the fuel tank 30. Accordingly the present invention relates to a scooter type<br>
vehicle wherein a pair of left and right upper frames<br>
extend rearwardly downwards from a head pipe; a pair of<br>
left and right down tubes extend downwardly from the head<br>
pipe below the pair of upperframes; lower ends of the down<br>
tubes are extended rearwardly and coupled to lower portions<br>
of the pair of upper frames such that a space portion of a<br>
substantially triangular shape as viewed in side elevation<br>
surrounded by the pair of upper frames and the pair of down<br>
tubes  is provided;  a  fuel  tank which  tapers  forwardly<br>
upwards along the upper  frames  and the down tubes  is<br>
disposed in the space portion; and a lower portion of the<br>
fuel tank is swollen and covered with a removable under<br>
frame which is positioned below the down tubes.<br>
7<br><br>
the running distance, it is demanded to increase the capacity of the fuel tank as much as possible.<br>
Further, the fuel tank cover 40 of the scooter type motorcycle of the official gazette of Japanese Patent Laid-Open No.   2000-229593   is  a member of a   large  size because it covers the fuel tank 301  In order to mold a cover of such a large size as just described as a single member, a metal mold for molding of a large size is required, and this makes a factor of increase of the production cost.  Besides, it is not necessarily easy to produce the fuel tank cover 40 of a complicated shape<br>
	 conformina to the .shape of the fuel tank 30.<br>
Accordingly the present invention relates to a scooter type<br>
vehicle wherein a pair of left and right upper frames extend rearwardly downwards from a head pipe; a pair of left and right down tubes extend downwardly from the head pipe below the pair of upperframes; lower ends of the down tubes are extended rearwardly and coupled to lower portions of the pair of upper frames such that a space portion of a substantially triangular shape as viewed in side elevation surrounded by the pair of upper frames and the pair of down tubes is provided; a fuel tank which tapers forwardly upwards along the upper frames and the down tubes is disposed in the space portion; and a lower portion of the fuel tank is swollen and covered with a removable under frame which is positioned below the down tubes.<br>
8<br><br>
Since, in a scooter type vehicle such as the scooter type vehicle of the official gazette of Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. Hei 10-203460 described above, the engine is supported below the pair of left and right rear frames spaced far away from the head pipe 3 rearwardly of the rearwardly downwardly inclined down frames connected to the head pipe 3, as the size of the engine increases, also the size of the body frame 2 increases and the strength of the entire body frame increases.  According to circumstances, it becomes necessary to use a cross member or the like for reinforcement to keep the rigidity.  On the other hand, a body frame which provides an easy riding feeling is sometimes demanded.<br>
In other words, it is desired to realize a body frame whose rigidity can be varied in accordance with an application while the rigidity of the entire body frame is assured.<br>
Therefore, it is an object of the present invention to provide a technique which can further increase the capacity of a fuel tank by devising the arrangement of a body frame to effectively utilize a limited space while assuring the rigidity of the body frame.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide a technique by which a heat shielding plate for a<br>
9<br><br>
fuel tank can be produced readily at a low cost.<br>
It is a further object of the present invention to provide an ignition coil disposition structure for a scooter type vehicle which is less liable to be influenced by heat of an engine and allows heat generated from an ignition coil itself to escape efficiently.<br>
It is a further object of the present invention to provide a body frame structure for a scooter type vehicle whose rigidity can be varied readily. [Means for Solving the Problems]<br>
Thus, in order to attain the object described above, according to claim 1, there is provided a fuel tank arrangement structure for a scooter type vehicle wherein a pair of left and right upper frames extend rearwardly downwards from a head pipe; a pair of left and right down tubes extend downwardly from the head pipe below the pair of upper frames; lower ends of the down tubes are extended rearwardly and coupled to lower portions of the pair of upper frames such that a space portion of a substantially triangular shape as viewed in side elevation surrounded by the pair of upper frames and the pair of down tubes is provided; a fuel tank which tapers forwardly upwards along the upper frames and the down tubes is disposed in the space portion; and a lower<br><br><br>
portion of the fuel tank is swollen and covered with a removable under frame which is positioned below the down tubes.<br>
Since a space portion of a substantially triangular shape as viewed in side elevation which tapers forwardly upwards is provided by the pair of upper frames and the pair of down tubes, the frame rigidity is improved. However, the accommodation space is reduced because the space portion has a substantially triangular shape as viewed in side elevation.<br>
In order to effectively utilize the space portion of the front upper portion, the front upper portion of the fuel tank is formed in a tapering configuration.  The capacity of the fuel tank can be increased as much. Further, since the pair of upper frames are disposed on the left and right, the frame rigidity is improved and the upper portion of the fuel tank can be extended to a space between the upper frames thereby to increase the tank capacity.  Furthermore, since the lower portion of the fuel tank is covered with the removable under frame, even if the fuel tank is extended downwardly farther than the down tubes to increase the capacity thereof, the fuel tank can be protected.  In this manner, the limited space can be made the most of to increase the capacity of the<br>
11<br><br>
fuel tank.<br>
Further, since the fuel tank has a substantially triangular shape which tapers forwardly upwardly, the center of gravity is positioned on the lower side.  By mounting such a fuel tank whose center of gravity is positioned at a low position as just described, the center of gravity of the motorcycle can be lowered.<br>
Claim 2 is characterized in that the fuel tank includes a closing cap at a fuel filler and has a breather sub tank provided at an upper portion thereof, and a breather hose having one end connected to the breather sub tank extends along the fuel tank and passes between the upper frames and the down tubes.<br>
Since the breather sub tank is provided above the fuel filler for which the closing cap is provided, fuel can be supplied to the level of the fuel filler into the fuel tank.  The supply amount into the fuel tank can be increased by an amount by which the fuel level rises.<br>
Claim 3 is characterized in that the breather hose is branched into a bifurcated shape at the other end thereof.<br>
Even if one of the two branches of the end branched into a bifurcated shape suffers from choking, air can be ventilated by the other branch. As a result, air<br><br><br>
ventilation between the inside of the sub tank and the atmospheric air can be assured with a higher degree of certainty.<br>
According to claim 4, a heat shielding structure for a fuel tank for a scooter type vehicle having a low floor is characterized in that a radiator is disposed at a front portion of the floor while an engine is disposed at a rear portion of the floor and a fuel tank is disposed between the radiator and the engine, and a divided heat shielding plate is disposed at least on each of a front face and a rear face of the fuel tank.<br>
The heat shielding plate for preventing an influence of heat from the engine and the radiator is divided into the heat shielding plates at least for the front face and the rear face of the fuel tank.  Since the divided heat shielding plates are used, they can be formed each with an arbitrary and minimum necessary size taking the degree of the influence of heat from the engine and the radiator into consideration and in accordance with the shapes of the faces of the fuel tank. As a result, the individual heat shielding plates are comparatively small in size and also manufacture of them is facilitated very much.  Besides, the metal mold for molding can be formed with a small size and also the<br><br><br>
material can be small in amount, and therefore, they can be produced at a low cost. Further, since the divided heat shielding plates are used, after the fuel tank is attached to the vehicle body, the heat shielding plates can be attached freely to the vehicle body, and the operability in attachment of them is high.<br>
According to claim 5, the heat shielding structure for a fuel tank for a scooter type vehicle is characterized in that the heat shielding plate disposed on the front face of the fuel tank is a sheet made of a resin and serving also as a wind guide for the radiator and is disposed between a down tube extending downwardly from a head pipe and the fuel tank.<br>
Since the heat shielding plate is formed from a resin sheet, it is very simple in shape and can be produced at a lower cost.  Further, since the heat shielding plate is disposed between the down tube and the fuel tank, the heat shielding plate can be attached simply to the down tube. Accordingly, the operability in attachment of the heat shielding plate is high. Furthermore, since the heat shielding plate serves also as a wind guide, there is no necessity to provide a separate wind guide and the number of parts can be small.<br>
According to claim 6, the heat shielding structure<br><br><br>
for a fuel tank for a scooter type vehicle is characterized in that the heat shielding plate disposed on the rear face or each of a left face and a right face of the fuel tank is a sheet made of rubber and is attached at an upper portion thereof to a body frame.<br>
The heat shielding plates are freely deformable because they are made of rubber, and can be disposed freely depending on a space around the fuel tank.  Besides, a small space around the fuel tank can be used effectively to dispose them simply.  Furthermore, since the heat shielding plates are each formed from a sheet, the shapes thereof are very simple and they can be produced at a lower cost.<br>
In order to attain the object described above, according to claim 7, an ignition coil disposition structure for a scooter type vehicle having a low floor is characterized in that an engine is disposed at a rear portion of the floor, and an engine ignition coil is disposed at a lower portion of a front portion of the floor.<br>
For example, if a vehicle is a scooter type vehicle having a large displacement, since the heat generation amount of the engine is large and the structure that the engine is covered therearound with a body cover is used,<br><br><br>
the pair of left and right rear frames, is characterized in that a cross member is removably attached to and extends between the pair of left and right rear frames above the engine.<br>
In a scooter type vehicle, as the size of an engine increases, the strength of a body frame is required, and it becomes necessary to use a cross member or the like for reinforcement to keep the rigidity.  On the other hand a body frame which provides an easy riding feeling is demanded.<br>
Therefore, the structure wherein a cross member is removably attached to and extends between a pair of left and right rear frames above an engine and the cross member can be replaced readily, for example, by fastening by means of bolts is used so that the rigidity of the body frame can be adjusted.<br>
Further, since the cross member is removably attached to and extends between the pair of left and right rear frames above the engine, maintenance of elements around the engine can be performed readily.<br>
Claim 11 is characterized in that the pair of left and right rear frames are members each having a vertically elongated sectional shape.<br>
Here, the vertically elongated sectional shape<br><br><br>
signifies a sectional shape which has a vertical dimension greater than a horizontal dimension, and where each of the rear frames is formed from a member of a vertically elongated sectional shape, an increase of the rigidity in the transverse directions can be suppressed while the rigidity in the longitudinal direction for supporting the seat and the rear cushion is assured sufficiently.  As a result, an easy driving feeling is assured while reduction in weight of the vehicle is achieved.<br>
Claim 12 is characterized in that the seat is a seat of the foldable type, and the cross member serves also as a member for supporting a seat hinge of the seat of the foldable type.<br>
Since the cross member serves also as a member for supporting the seat hinge of the seat of the foldable type, the part number of component parts can be reduced and the cost of the body frame can be reduced.  Further, since the seat hinge can be removed from the body frame, modification to the configuration of the seat hinge and maintenance of elements around the engine can be performed further readily.<br>

The front frame 112 includes a pair of left and right upper frames 113, 113 extending rearwardly downwards from the head pipe 111, and a pair of left and right down tubes 114, 114 extending downwardly from the head pipe 111 below the pair of upper frames 113, 113. Lower ends of the pair of down tubes 114, 114 extend rearwardly and are coupled to lower ends (lower portions) of the pair of upper frames 113, 113, and further extend rearwardly upwards.<br>
More particularly, front ends of the left and right upper frames 113, 113 are coupled to an upper portion of the head type 111 and the upper frames 113, 113 are extended rearwardly downwards, and front ends of the left and right down tubes 114, 114 are coupled to a lower portion of the head type 111 below the upper frames 113, 113 and the down tubes 114, 114 are extended downwardly.<br>
Since the front frame 112 has such a configuration as just described, a space portion Spl of a substantially triangular shape as viewed in side elevation defined by the pair of upper frames 113, 113 and the pair of down tubes 114, 114 can be provided. Accordingly, the frame rigidity can be raised.  However, since this space portion<br><br><br>
Spl exhibits a forwardly upwardly tapering configuration, it is a narrow space portion.<br>
Furthermore, the front ends of the down tubes 114, 114 are disposed at a position lower by a predetermined height than the front ends of the upper frames 113, 113 with respect to the head type 111. As a result, a forward upper portion of the space portion Spl can be further expanded.<br>
A first cross member 121 of a gate shape as viewed in front elevation extends between a front end of the left rear frame 115 and a front end of the right rear frame 115 while a second cross member 122 extends between a lower end of the left upper frame 113 and a lower end of the right upper frame 113, and an engine first bracket<br>
123	is coupled to a central position of the second cross<br>
member 122 in the width of the vehicle.<br>
A third cross member 124 extends between a rear end portion of a horizontal portion of the left down tube 114 and a rear end portion of a horizontal portion of the right down tube 114 and an engine second bracket 125 is coupled to a central position of the third cross member<br>
124	in the width of the vehicle, and left and right<br>
engine third brackets 126, 126 are coupled to rear ends<br>
of the left and right down tubes 114, 114.<br><br><br>
The pair of left and right rear frames 115, 115 are members of a vertically elongated sectional shape which are coupled at one end thereof to longitudinally intermediate portions of the pair of left and right upper frames 113,   113  and  extend rearwardly at the other end thereof. Here, the "vertically elongated sectional shape" signifies a sectional shape which has a vertical dimension greater than a horizontal dimension. More particularly, the rear frames 115, 115 are each formed from an angular pipe of a vertically elongated rectangular section.<br>
The present invention is characterized in that three cross members 131 to 133 are removably attached to and extend between the pair of left and right rear frames 115, 115. More particularly, a front portion rear cross member 131, a middle portion rear cross member 132 and a rear portion rear cross member 133 are provided in this order from the front and extend between the left and right rear frames 115, 115.<br>
The three cross members 131 to 133 are placed on upper faces of the rear frames 115, 115 and fastened thereto by bolts.  Since the rear frames 115, 115 are each formed  from an  angular  pipe, it is easy  to  attach   them with the three cross members 131 to 133 placed thereon.<br><br><br>
The front portion rear cross member 131 is a member of a gate shape as viewed in front elevation, and a U-shaped stay 131a open rearwardly in plan view extends forwardly from left and right upright sides of the front portion rear cross member 131. A seat hinge support portion 131b is coupled to a front end of the U-shaped stay 131a, and an extension member 131c extends forwardly from the front end of the U-shaped stay 131a and the first cross member 121 is fastened to a front end of the extension member 131c by a bolt.  The middle portion rear cross member 132 is a bar like member, and a seat catch member not shown for holding the seat 208 (refer to FIG. 3) in its closed state is attached to the middle portion rear cross member 132.  The rear portion rear cross member 133 is a belt-like member formed by aluminum die casting and having a U shape open forwardly as viewed in plan view.<br>
It is to be noted that an increase of the rigidity of the rear frames 115, 115 in transverse directions where the rear ends of the rear frames 115, 115 are connected to each other is prevented by fastening of the rear portion rear cross member 133 by means of a bolt thereby to augment the influence to be had on a riding feeling of the motorcycle.  Further, another seat catch<br>
33<br><br>
member not shown for holding the seat 208 in its closed state is attached to the rear portion rear cross member 133. Thus, the motorcycle has a structure wherein, by removing the bolts used for fastening, the seat hinge 208c and the seat catches can be removed from the body frame 110 together with the cross members 131 to 133.<br>
Further, left and right cushion brackets 134, 134 are coupled to rear portions of the left and right rear frames 115, 115, and a rear lower portion rear cross member 135 of a substantially U shape as viewed in front elevation extends between and is welded to rear portions of the left and right rear frames 115, 115 and left and right transporting hooks 136, 136 are coupled to the rear lower portion rear cross member 135.<br>
It is to be noted that, since the rear lower portion rear cross member 135 is formed in a U-shape, an increase of the rigidity in transverse directions by the connection of the rear portions of the rear frames 115, 115 is prevented thereby to augment the riding feeling of the motorcycle.<br>
This figure also shows that a pair of left and right floor supporting stays 141, 141 and an under frame 143 are removably attached to the body frame 110 and a plurality of headed pins 144, ... (... signifies that a<br>

This similarly applies in the following description).<br>
In particular, a space portion Sp2 of a substantially triangular shape as viewed in side elevation defined by the pair of upper frames 113, 113, the pair of down tubes 114, 114 and the pair of rear frames 115, 115 is provided at a rear portion of the front frame 112, and a cylinder head 215 and a head cover 216 of the engine 211 are disposed in the space portion Sp2. A lower portion of a front portion of the engine 211 is attached to the engine first bracket 123 while a lower portion of a rear portion of the engine 211 is attached to  the engine  second bracket  125,   and an  upper portion  of a rear portion of the engine 211 is attached to the<br><br><br>
engine third brackets 126, 126.  The front portion rear cross member 131 and the middle portion rear cross member 132 are disposed above the engine 211.<br>
Further, this figure shows (1) that a rear end portion  of   the power transmission mechanism 212   is suspended on the left and right cushion brackets 134, 134 through the left and right rear cushion units 206, 206 and (2) that the front portion rear cross member 131 serves also as a member for supporting a seat hinge 208c of the foldable seat 208.  In this manner, the rear cushion units 206,   206  and the seat 208  can  be supported by the rear frames 115, 115.<br>
In particular, the body frame structure for a scooter type vehicle according to the present invention is configured such that, in the body frame for a scooter type vehicle wherein the pair of left and right rear frames 115, 115 (one of   the rear frames 115 is not shown) extend rearwardly from a rear portion of the front frame 112 connecting to the head pipe 111 and the seat 208 and the rear cushions 206, 206 (one of the rear cushions 206 is not shown) are supported on the rear frames 115 and the engine 211 is disposed rearwardly of the front frame 112 below the pair of rear frames 115, 115, the cross members 131 to 133 (for the cross member 133, refer to<br><br><br>
FIG. 4) are removably attached to and extend between the pair of left and right rear frames 115, 115.<br>
In a scooter type vehicle, as the size of the engine increases, the strength of the body frame is required, and it becomes necessary to use a cross member or the like for reinforcement to keep the rigidity.  On the other hand, a body frame which provides an easy riding feeling is demanded.<br>
Therefore, the structure wherein the cross members 131 to 133 are removably attached to and extend between the pair of left and right rear frames 115, 115 above the engine 211 and the cross members 131 to 133 can be replaced readily, for example, by fastening by means of bolts is used so that the rigidity of the body frame 110 can be adjusted.<br>
Further, since the cross members 131 to 133 are removably attached to and extend between the pair of left and right rear frames 115, 115 above the engine 211, maintenance of elements around the engine 211 can be performed readily.<br>
Further, the body frame structure for a scooter type vehicle according to the present invention can be considered as a structure wherein the pair of left and right rear frames 115, 115 (one of the rear frames 115 is<br><br><br>
not shown) are each formed from a member having a vertically elongated sectional shape.<br>
Here, the vertically elongated sectional shape signifies a sectional shape which has a vertical dimension greater than a horizontal dimension, and where each of the rear frames is formed from a member of a vertically elongated sectional shape, an increase of the rigidity in the transverse directions can be suppressed while the rigidity in the longitudinal direction for supporting the seat 208 and the rear cushion units 206, 206 (rear cushions) is assured sufficiently. As a result, an easy driving feeling is assured while reduction in weight of the vehicle is achieved.<br>
Furthermore, the body frame structure for a scooter type vehicle according to the present invention can be considered also as a structure wherein, where the seat 208 is a seat of the foldable type, the front portion cross member 131 (cross member) serves also as a member for supporting the seat hinge 208c.<br>
Since the front portion cross member 131 serves also as a member for supporting the seat hinge 208c, the part number of component parts can be reduced and the cost of the body frame 110 can be reduced.  Further, since the seat hinge 208c can be removed from the body frame<br>
40<br><br>
110, modification to the configuration of the seat hinge 208c and maintenance of elements around the engine 211 can be performed further readily.<br>
FIG. 6 is a side elevational sectional view of a lower portion of a front portion of the motorcycle in which the body frame structure for a scooter type vehicle according to the present invention is incorporated with the motorcycle 10 viewed from the left side location and shows that the engine 211 is disposed at a rear portion of the low floor type floor 25 indicated by an imaginary line while an engine-cooling radiator 221 is disposed at a front portion of the floor 25, and the ignition coil 226 is disposed at a lower portion of a front portion of the floor 25 and a fuel tank 230 is disposed between the engine 211 and the radiator 221.<br>
In particular, the radiator 221 is disposed forwardly of the engine 211 and forwardly of the left and right down tubes 114, 114 (only the left side one is shown in the figure.  This similarly applies in the following description).<br>
A return pipe 222 for returning coolant from the engine 211 to the radiator 221 is a hose passing at a rather left portion (forwardly in the figure) with respect to the center in the width of the vehicle. More<br><br><br>
particularly, the return pipe 222 connecting to a coolant returning port of the engine 211 extends along the horizontal portion of the left down tube 114 and along the downwardly extending portion of the front portion of the left down tube 114 and is connected to an upper header 221a of the radiator 221.<br>
Meanwhile, a supply pipe 223 for supplying coolant from the radiator 221 to the engine 211 is a hose passing on the rather right side (on the farther side of the figure) with respect to the center in the width of the vehicle. More particularly, the supply pipe 223 connecting to a lower header 221b of the radiator 221 extends rearwardly along the horizontal portion of the right down tube 114 (farther side one of the figure) and is connected to a coolant inlet port of the engine 211. Reference numeral 224 denotes a radiator fan.<br>
The ignition coil 226 is characterized in that it is disposed at a right position (on the farther side of the figure) with respect to the center of the width of the vehicle on the opposite side to the return pipe 222 and forwardly of the radiator 221.<br>
In this manner, the ignition coil 226 can be disposed at a position (1) at which it does not have an influence of heat from the engine 211, (2) at which it<br><br><br>
does not have an influence of heat of exhaust gas from the radiator 221 and (3) at which it does not have an influence of heat from the return pipe 222.<br>
The fuel tank 230 is disposed in the space portion Spl of a substantially triangular shape, which has a forwardly upwardly tapering configuration, in side elevation defined by the pair of left and right upper frames 113, 113 and the pair of left and right down tubes 114, 114.<br>
In order to dispose such a fuel tank 230 as described above making the most of the space portion Spl, the fuel tank 230 is a vessel whose forward upper portion is tapering along the upper frames 113, 113 and the down tubes 114, 114 when it is viewed from sidewardly of the vehicle body as seen in the figure.  In particular, in order to make effective use of the space portion at the forward upward portion of the space portion Spl, a forward upper portion of the fuel tank 230 is formed in a tapering configuration and a lower portion of the fuel tank 230 is swollen downwardly.  The capacity of the fuel tank 230 can be increased as much.<br>
Besides, since the upper frames 113, 113 are disposed on the left and right, the upper portion of the fuel tank can be extended to the space between the upper<br><br><br>
frames 113, 113 to increase the capacity.<br>
In this manner, the limited space can be made the most of to increase the capacity of the fuel tank 230.<br>
Further, in order to increase the volume, a lower portion of the fuel tank 23 0 extends downwardly farther than the down tubes 114, 114.  The lower portion of the fuel tank 230 extending downwardly farther than the down tubes 114, 114 is covered with the removable under frame 143 positioned below the down tubes 114, 114 so that the fuel tank 230 can be protected.  In this manner, the fuel tank 23 0 can be extended downwardly farther than the down tubes 114, 114 to increase the capacity thereof. After the fuel tank 230 is inserted into the space portion Spl from below the body frame 110 and attached, the under frame 143 is attached to the body frame 110.<br>
Further, since the fuel tank 230 has a substantially triangular shape which tapers at the front upper portion thereof, the center of gravity is positioned on the lower side. By mounting such a fuel tank 230 whose center of gravity is positioned at a low position as just described, the center of gravity of the motorcycle 10 can be lowered.<br>
In particular, the ignition coil disposition structure for a scooter type vehicle according to the<br><br><br>
present invention can be said that, in the scooter type vehicle having the low floor 25, the engine 211 is disposed at a rear portion of the floor 25, and the engine ignition coil 226 is disposed at a lower portion of a front portion of the floor 25.<br>
For example, if the vehicle is a scooter type vehicle having a large displacement, since the heat generation amount of the engine is great and the structure that the engine is covered therearound with a body cover is used, sufficient consideration about heat is required.<br>
Therefore, the engine 211 is disposed at a rear portion of the floor 25 and the ignition coil 226 is disposed at a lower portion of a front portion of the floor 25 thereby to position the ignition coil 226 in a spaced relationship away from the engine 211 so that the ignition coil 226 may not be influenced by the heat of the engine 211.<br>
As a result, the life of the engine ignition coil 226 can be extended.<br>
Further, since the engine ignition coil 226 is disposed at a lower portion of a front portion of the floor 25, effective utilization of the space below the low floor 25 can be anticipated.<br><br><br>
Further, the ignition coil disposition structure for a scooter type vehicle according to the present invention can be said that the engine cooling radiator 221 is disposed forwardly of the floor 25, and the engine ignition coil 226  is  disposed  forwardly of   the  engine cooling radiator 221.<br>
Since the engine cooling radiator 211 is disposed forwardly of the floor 25 and the engine ignition coil 226 is disposed forwardly of the engine cooling radiator 221, the engine ignition coil 226 can be prevented from being influenced by the heat of exhaust wind from the radiator 221, and the heat generated by the engine ignition coil 226 itself can be radiated.<br>
Furthermore, the ignition coil disposition structure for a scooter type vehicle according to the present invention can be said that the engine cooling radiator 221 is disposed forwardly of the floor 25, and the return pipe 222 for returning cooling water from the engine 211 to the engine cooling radiator 221 extends at a position displaced leftwardly or rightwardly from the center of the width of the vehicle while the engine ignition coil 226 is disposed at a position on the opposite side to  the return pipe  222  with  respect   to   the center of the width of the vehicle.<br><br><br>
Since the engine ignition coil 226 is disposed at a position on the opposite side to the return pipe 222 with respect to the center of the width of the vehicle, the engine ignition coil 226 can be prevented from being influenced by  the heat  from   the return pipe 222.<br>
The fuel tank 230 is disposed in the space portion Spl of a substantially triangular shape in side elevation defined by the pair of left and right upper frames 113,<br>
113	and the pair of left and right down tubes 114, 114. Since such a fuel tank 230 as described above is disposing making effective use of the space portion Spl, it is a vessel whose forward upper portion is tapering along the upper frames 113, 113 and the down tubes 114,<br>
114	when it is viewed from sidewardly of the vehicle body as seen in the figure.  Further, in order to increase the volume, a lower portion of the fuel tank 230 extends downwardly farther than the down tubes 114, 114.  The lower portion of the fuel tank 230 extending downwardly farther than the down tubes 114, 114 is covered with the removable under frame 143 so that the fuel tank 230 can be protected.<br>
After the fuel tank 230 is inserted into the space portion Spl   from below  the body frame  110  and  attached, the under frame 143 is attached to the body frame 110.<br><br><br>
FIG. 7 is a perspective view of members around the fuel tank and is further a perspective view of members around the fuel tank of the motorcycle in which the body frame structure for a scooter type vehicle according to the present invention is incorporated.  It is also a perspective view of members around the fuel tank of the motorcycle which adopts the ignition coil disposition structure for a scooter type vehicle according to the present invention.<br>

breather sub tank 235 is a small vessel communicated with the inside of the fuel tank 230.<br>
In this manner, since the closing cap 237 is provided for the fuel filler 234, the breather sub tank 235 is provided for the fuel tank 230.  Further, the breather sub tank 235 is provided at a substantially uppermost portion of the upper face 230a of the fuel tank 230 higher than the fuel filler 234 so that air ventilation with the atmospheric air can be performed through the breather sub tank 235. As a result, fuel can be supplied to the level of the fuel filler 234 into the fuel tank 230.  The supply amount to the fuel tank 230 can be increased by an amount by which the fuel level rises.<br>
The present invention is characterized in that a heat insulating plate for preventing an influence of heat from the engine 211, radiator 221, return pipe 222 and supply pipe 223 (refer to FIG. 6) is divided into four members denoted by reference numerals 241, 242, 243 and 243, and the thus divided heat insulating plates 241, 242, 243 and 243 are disposed on the front face, rear face, left face and right face of the fuel tank 230.<br>
Since the heat insulating plates 241, 242, 243 and 243 are divisional insulating plates, they can be formed each with an arbitrary and minimum necessary size taking<br>
49<br><br>
the degree of the influence of heat from the engine 211 and the radiator 221 into consideration and in accordance with the shapes of the faces of the fuel tank 230. As a result, the heat insulating plates 241, 242, 243 and 243 are comparatively small in size and also manufacture of them is facilitated very much.  Besides, the metal mold for molding can be formed with a small size and also the material can be small in amount, and therefore, they can be produced at a low cost.<br>
The front portion heat insulating plate 241 which covers the front face of the fuel tank 230 is a sheet made of a resin such as a hard resin and exhibiting a generally rectangular shape as viewed in front elevation. Since the front portion heat insulating plate 241 is formed from a resin sheet, it is very simple in shape and can be produced at a lower cost.<br>
The rear portion heat insulating plate 242 which covers the rear face of the fuel tank 230 is a sheet of a substantially rectangular shape made of rubber, and has two left and right hooking holes 242a, 242a at an upper portion thereof and has one hooking hole 242b at a lower portion thereof.<br>
The left and right heat insulating plates 243, 243 which cover a lower half of the left face and a lower<br><br><br>
half of the right face of the fuel tank 230 are sheets made of rubber and each having two hooking holes 243a, 243a at an upper portion thereof. The left and right heat insulating plates 243, 243 are disposed between the fuel tank 230 and the return pipe 222 and supply pipe 223 (refer to FIG. 6) . Heat of the return pipe 222 and the supply pipe 223 is prevented from being transmitted to the fuel tank 230 in this manner.<br>
In this manner, the rear portion heat insulating plate 242 and the left and right heat insulating plates 243, 243 are freely deformable because they are made of rubber, and can be disposed freely in accordance with a space around the fuel tank 230.  Besides, a small space around the fuel tank 230 can be used effectively to dispose them simply.  Furthermore, since the rear portion heat insulating plate 242 and the left and right heat insulating plates 243, 243 are each formed from a sheet, the shapes thereof are very simple and they can be produced at a lower cost.<br>
Description is continued referring back once to FIG. 6.<br>
The front portion heat insulating plate 241 is disposed between the down tube 114 extending downwardly from the head pipe 111 and the fuel tank 230 and<br><br><br>
removably attached to a front cross member 151 so as to be a member serving also as a wind guide for the radiator 221. Therefore, an upper end of the front portion heat insulating plate 241 is curved to an upper portion side of the radiator 221, and a lower end of the front portion heat insulating plate 241 extends to a position below the radiator 221.<br>
Since the front portion heat insulating plate 241 is disposed between the down tube 114 and the fuel tank 230 in this manner, the front portion heat insulating plate 241 can be attached simply to the fuel tank 230. Accordingly, the operability in attachment of the front portion heat insulating plate 241 is high.<br>
The rear portion heat insulating plate 242 can be removably attached to the body frame 110 by hooking an upper portion thereof to the headed pins 144 and hooking a lower portion thereof to the hook 148.<br>
Meanwhile, the left and right heat insulating plates 243, 243 (only the left one is shown in the figure) can be removably attached to the body frame 110 each by hooking an upper portion thereof to the headed pins 144, ....<br>
As apparent from the foregoing description, since the divided heat insulating plates 241, 242, 243 and 243<br>
52<br><br>
are used, after the fuel tank 230 is attached to the body frame 110 (vehicle body), the heat insulating plates 241, 242, 243 and 243 can be attached freely to the body frame 110, and the operability in attachment of them is high.<br>
Since  the fuel   tank 230 has a  structure  wherein they are placed one on the other as described above, the overlapping portion thereof does not hit the upper frames 113, 113, down tubes 114, 114 or under frame 143.  The space portion Spl can be utilized effectively as much, and as a result, the capacity of the fuel tank 230 can be further increased.<br>
This figure shows that the front of the radiator 221 is covered with a front lower cover 93 and the bottoms of the radiator 221 and the fuel tank 230 are covered with an under cover 94.<br>
The front lower cover 93 extends to a front end of the under cover 94 and has a plurality of radiator wind inlet ports 93a, ... in a front face thereof.<br>
The under cover 94 has an exhaust wind port 94a below the fan 224 for discharging exhaust wind of the radiator 221 to the outside.  The exhaust wind port 94a includes a large number of louvers (current plates) 94b,    ... directed obliquely rearwardly.<br>
This figure further shows that an oil feeding lid<br><br><br>
330 which is opened when fuel is to be supplied into the fuel tank 230 through the fuel filler 234 and an inspection lid 360 which is opened when an ignition plug (not shown) of the engine 211 is to be inspected are provided on the body cover 20.<br>
FIG. 8 is a view as viewed in the direction of an arrow mark 8 in FIG. 6 and shows a structure wherein the fuel tank 230 is attached to the body frame 110.<br>
The body frame 110 includes an upper portion bracket 154 extending between left and right stays 152, 152 and lower portion brackets 155, 155 attached to the left and right down tubes 114, 114. The fuel tank 230 can be removably attached to the body frame 110 by fastening an upper portion of the flange 233 of the fuel tank 230 to the upper portion bracket 154 by means of a bolt and fastening a lower portion of the flange 233 to the lower portion brackets 155, 155 by means of bolts.  It is to be noted that the upper portion of the flange 233 is fastened tightly to the upper portion bracket 154 by means of a bolt.<br>
FIG. 9 is a sectional view taken along line 9-9 of FIG. 8 and shows a rubber-mounted state wherein a lower portion of the flange 233 is attached to the lower bracket 155 by means of a bolt and nut 157 with a rubber<br><br><br>
bush 156 interposed therebetween.  Reference numeral 158 denotes a collar.<br>
FIG. 10 is a front elevational sectional view of the motorcycle and shows (1) that the body frame 110 and the fuel tank 23 0 are covered with the center cover 24, the left and right floors 25, 25, the left and right floor skirts 26, 26, and the under cover 94 and (2) that the floors 25, 25 are fastened to the left and right down tubes 114, 114 through the floor supporting stays 141, 141 by means of bolts.<br>
The left and right heat insulating plates 243, 243 hooked to the headed pins 144, ... in such a manner as described above depend along the sides of the fuel tank 230 and extend along gaps between the side faces of the fuel tank 230 and the down tubes 114, 114.  Since upper portions of the left and right heat insulating plates 243, 243 are merely hooked to the body frame 110 in this manner, they can be attached simply.<br>
Upper portions of the left and right heat insulating plates 243, 243 are attached to outer faces of the upper frames 113, 113, and lower portions of them are disposed on the inner sides of the down tubes 114, 114, return pipe 222  and supply pipe 223. Accordingly, heat of the return pipe 222 and the supply pipe 223 can be<br><br><br>
prevented from having an influence on the fuel tank 230.<br>
FIG. 11 is a view illustrating operation of elements around the radiator to the present invention, and the fan 224 located rearwardly of the radiator 221 sucks wind from forwardly of the radiator 221.  Therefore, external air enters as a cooling wind (including a traveling wind upon running of the vehicle) Fc into the radiator wind inlet ports 93a, ... and flows along a cooling water path until it enters the radiator 221.<br>
The hot air (hot exhaust air) Fh having passed through the radiator 221 is discharged from the fan 224 and diverted downwardly by the guidance of the front portion heat insulating plate 241 serving also as a wind guide, and then flows out from the exhaust wind port 94a of the under cover 94.<br>
Since the direction of the hot air Fh having passed through the radiator 221 is changed by the front portion heat insulating plate 241, an influence of the hot air Fh upon the engine 211 and the fuel tank 230 located rearwardly of the radiator 221 can be prevented.  Further, since the front portion heat insulating plate 241 serves also as a wind guide, there is no necessity to provide a separate wind guide.<br>
FIG. 12 is a schematic view of the fuel tank<br><br><br>
according to the present invention and particularly shows the fuel tank of the motorcycle which adopts the ignition coil disposition structure for a scooter type vehicle according to the present invention.  Further it is a schematic view of the fuel tank of the motorcycle in which the body frame structure for a scooter type vehicle according to the present invention is incorporated and shows that a tray 251 which covers around the fuel filler 234 is provided on the fuel tank 230 and one end 252a of a fuel discharging hose (drain hose) 252 is connected to the tray 251 while the other end 252b of the fuel discharging hose 252 is open to the atmospheric air.<br>
As described hereinabove, the breather sub tank 235 is communicated with the inside of the fuel tank 230.  One end 253a of the breather hose 253 is connected to the breather sub tank 235, and the other end of the breather hose 253 is branched into a bifurcated shape.<br>
Since a less expensive hose is used for the fuel discharging pipe material and the breather pipe material in this manner, reduction of the cost relating to the fuel tank 230 can be achieved.  Reference numeral 254 denotes a T-joint for branching the other end of the breather hose 253.<br>
FIG. 13 is a rear elevational sectional view of<br><br><br>
elements around the oil filler of the fuel tank according to the present invention, and the tray 251 is a fuel receiving pan wherein a tubular portion 251b extending upwardly and downwardly is formed integrally with a flat bottom 251a.  The tray 251 can be  attached by inserting the tubular portion 251b into the fuel filler 234 and clamping the opposite upper and lower faces of the bottom 251a with a bottom 24b of a recessed portion 24a provided at an oil filler portion of the center cover 24 and the upper face 230a of the fuel tank 230. Accordingly, such a member as a bolt for attaching the tray 251 is not required, and also the attachment of it is easy. Reference character 24c denotes an oil filler through-hole .<br>
FIG. 14 is an appearance view of the right side of the body frame structure and the fuel tank according to the present invention, and the tray 251 has an outlet port 251c extending rearwardly downwards.  The one end 252a of the fuel discharging hose 252 is connected to the outlet port 251c, and the fuel discharging hose 252 extends downwardly along the right upper frame 113 to a portion of a right end of a rear portion of the under cover 94 and the other end 252b is directed downwardly.<br>
Fuel spilt around the fuel filler 234 while fuel is<br><br><br>
supplied into the fuel tank 230 can be received by the tray 251 and discharged to the outside through the fuel discharging hose 252. Accordingly, there is no possibility that the outer face of the fuel tank may be wet with spilt fuel.<br>
Meanwhile, the breather sub tank 235 includes a breather port 235a extending to the right side. The one end 253a of the breather hose 253 is connected to the breather port 235a, and the breather hose 253 extends rearwardly downwards along the right side face of the fuel tank 230.<br>
In particular, the breather hose 253 extends, when the fuel tank 230 is viewed in front elevation, along the fuel tank 230 between the upper frame 113 and the down tube 114 to a right end of a rear portion of the under cover 94 and is branched into a bifurcated shape.<br>
The other end 253b of one of the branches extends to a portion of a left end of a rear portion of the under cover 94 and is open to the atmospheric air while the other end 253c of the other of the branches extends upwardly along the rear face of the fuel tank 230 once and then rearwardly along the left upper frame 113 and is then open to the atmospheric air. Accordingly, even if one of the two other ends 235b, 235b suffers from choking,<br><br><br>
that reference numerals 335, 335 denote pivot shafts for supporting the main stand 320 for pivotal motion on the left and right attachment brackets 218L and 218R, and 336, 336 left and right ground contacting faces of the stand body 321.<br>
FIG. 22 is a side elevational view of a main stand adopted in the body frame structure for a scooter type vehicle according to the present invention.  In particular, the main stand attachment structure includes the pair of left and right hinge stays 322L and 322R supported for swinging movement on the pair of left and right attachment brackets 218L and 218R attached to the crankcase 217.<br>
Since the hinge stays 322L and 322R are supported for swinging movement on the left and right attachment brackets 218L and 218R of the crankcase 217, the distance from the oil feeding tray rear portion 336, 336 of the main stand to the pivot shaft can be made short.  For example, a cross member which is to extend between the hinge stays 322L and 322R can be eliminated, and reduction of the cost of the main stand 320 can be achieved.<br>
FIG. 23 is a side elevational sectional view of elements around an inspection lid adopted in the body<br>
60<br><br>
frame structure for a scooter type vehicle according to the present invention. The inspection lid 360 includes a lid body 361, a front arresting portion 362 formed on the lid body 361 for being arrested at the center cover 24, a rear arresting portion 363 formed on the lid body 361 for being arrested at the seat hinge support portion 131b, and an escapement hole 364 formed in the lid body 361 for passing heat from the engine therethrough to so that the heat may escape rearwardly.<br>
Since, in the scooter type vehicle of a large size, also much heat is generated by the engine 211, a heat radiation countermeasure for every part is required.<br>
Therefore, the escapement hole 364 for concentrating flows of heat upon the inspection lid 360 provided for inspection of the engine 211 is formed so that heat Ql, ... generated from the engine 211 may be introduced to a seat bottom 208d as indicated by arrow marks Q2 so that it may escape rearwardly making use of running wind. Accordingly, hot air around the engine 211 can be prevented from being staying in the body cover 20.<br>
Further, upon inspection of the engine 211, the inspection lid 360 is removed to perform the inspection.<br>
FIG. 24 is an exploded perspective view showing a seat lower portion heat insulating structure adopted in<br>
