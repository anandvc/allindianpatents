Field of the Invention<br>
 The present invention relates in general to surgical stapler instruments that are<br>
capable of apply ng lines of staples to tissue while cutting the tissue between those<br>
staple lines and, more particularly, to improvements relating to stapler instruments<br>
and improvements in processes for forming various components of such stapler<br>
instruments that include an articulating shaft.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Endoscopic surgical instruments are often preferred over traditional open<br>
surgical devices since a smaller incision tends to reduce the post-operative recovery<br>
time and complications. Consequently, significant development has gone into a range<br>
of endoscopic surgical instruments that are suitable for-precise placement of a distal<br>
end effector at a desired surgical site through a cannula of a trocar: These distal end<br>
effectors engage the tissue in a number of ways to achieve a diagnostic or therapeutic<br>
effect (e.g., endocutter, grasper, cutter, staplers, clip applier, access device, drug/gene<br>
therapy delivery device, and energy device using ultrasound, RF, laser, etc.).<br>
Positioning the end effector is constrained by the trocar. Generally these<br>
endoscopic surgical instruments include a long shaft between the end effector and a<br>
handle portion tranipulated by the clinician, this long shaft enables insertion to a<br>
desired depth and rotation about the longitudinal axis of the shaft, thereby positioning<br>
the end effector 10 a degree. With judicious placement of the trocar and use of<br>
graspers, for instance, through another trocar, often this amount of positioning is<br>
sufficient. Surgical stapling and severing instruments, such as described in U.S. Pat.<br>
No. 5,465,895, are an example of an endoscopic surgical instrument that successfully<br>
positions an end effector by insertion and rotation.<br>
Depending upon the nature of the operation, it may be desirable to further<br>
i<br>
adjust the positioning of the end effector of an endoscopic surgical instrument rather<br>
than being limited to insertion and rotation. In particular, it is often desirable to orient<br><br>
the end effector it an axis transverse to the longitudinal axis of the shaft of the<br>
instrument. The transverse movement of the end effector relative to the instrument<br>
shaft is conventionally referred to as "articulation". This articulated positioning<br>
permits the clini:ian to more easily engage tissue in some instances. In addition,<br>
articulated posit oning advantageously allows an endoscope to be positioned behind<br>
the end effector without being blocked by the instrument shaft.<br>
While the aforementioned non-articulating stapling and severing instruments<br>
have great utility and may be successfully employed in many surgical procedures, it is<br>
desirable to enhance their operation with the ability to articulate the end effector,<br>
thereby giving greater clinical flexibility in their use. Articulating surgical instruments<br>
generally use one or more firing bars that move longitudinally within the instrument<br>
shaft and through the articulation joint to fire the staples from the cartridge and to cut<br>
the tissue between the innermost staple lines. One common problem with these<br>
surgical instruments is control of the firing bar through the articulation joint. At the<br>
articulation join., the end effector is longitudinal ly spaced away from the shaft so that<br>
the edges of the shaft and end effector don't collide during articulation. This gap must<br>
be filled with support material or structure to prevent the firing bar from buckling out<br>
of the joint when the single or multiple firing bars is subjected to longitudinal firing<br>
loads. What is needed is a support structure that guides and supports the single or<br>
multiple firing bars through the articulation joint and bends or curves as the end<br>
effector is articulated.<br>
U.S. Fat No. 5,673,840 describes a flexible articulation joint that is formed<br>
from an elastomeric or plastic material that bends at the flexible joint or "flex neck".<br>
The firing bars ire supported and guided through a hollow tube within the flex neck.<br>
The flex neck is a portion of the jaw closure mechanism and moves longitudinally<br>
relative to the etd effector, shaft, and firing bars when the jaws are closed on tissue.<br>
The firing bars then move longitudinally withir. the flex neck as the staples are fired<br>
and tissue is cut<br>
U.S. Pat, No. 5,797,537 to Allen describes an articulation joint that pivots<br>
around a pin, rather than bends around a flex joint. In this instrument, firing bars arc<br>
supported between a pair of spaced support plates connected at one end to the shaft<br>
and at another and to the end effector. At least one of those connections is a slidable<br>
connection. The support plates extend through the articulation joint adjacent to the<br>
flexible drive number in the plane of articulation such that the support plates bend<br>
through the gap in the plane of articulation and the flexible firing bar bends against<br>
the support when the tip is articulated in one direction from its aligned position. U.S.<br>
6,330,965 from U.S. Surgical teaches the use of support plates that are fixedly<br>
attached to the spaft and slidably attached to the end effector.<br>
Although these known support plates guide a firing bar through an articulation<br>
joint, it is believed that performance may be enhanced. For instance, it is often<br>
desirable for the firing bar to be rapidly accelerated during firing in order to ensure<br>
sufficient momentum to 6ever tissue effectively. Rigidly attached support plates may<br>
tend to dislodge in response, allowing the firing bar to blow out from the articulation<br>
joint. As a further example, it is desirable for the instrument to operate in the same<br>
manner whether articulated or not. Increased friction when articulated would be<br>
inconvenient and distracting to the clinician if required to exert a varying amount of<br>
firing force.<br>
Conseqaently, a significant need exists for an improved articulation<br>
mechanism for a surgical instrument mechanisms that provides enhanced support to a<br>
firing bar through the articulation joint.<br>
Brief Summary of the Invention<br>
 The invention overcomes the above-noted and other deficiencies of the prior<br>
art by providing an articulating surgical instrument that actuates an end effector with a<br>
longitudinally translating firing mechanism advantageously supported through an<br>
articulation mechanism by flanking support plates. In order to better respond to firing<br>
loads on the firing mechanism, one or more ends of each support plate are resiliently<br>
or springedly engaged to one side of the articulation mechanism, and thus are better<br>
able to avoid buckling of the firing mechanism.<br>
— In one aspect of the invention, a surgical instrument has a handle portion that<br>
produces an art culation motion and a firing motion, both of which are transferred<br>
through a shaft to an articulation mechanism. The articulation mechanism responds to<br>
the articulation motion to rotate an end effector from the longitudinal axis of the shaft.<br>
A firing mechanism responds to the firing motion and is coupled for movement<br>
through the articulation mechanism and the end effector. A pair of support plates<br>
flank the firing mechanism across the articulat on mechanism, each support plate<br>
including an en i springedly engaged to a frame recess formed in the articulation<br>
mechanism to assist in preventing buckling of the firing mechanism out of the<br>
articulation mechanism. Thus various types of actuated diagnostic or therapeutic end<br>
effectors may be incorporated into an articulating surgical instrument without<br>
buckling at the articulation mechanism, even with high firing forces and reduces<br>
component dimensions for endoscopic use.<br>
— In another aspect of the invention, a surgical instrument has a handle portion<br>
that produces a firing motion, a closing motion, and an articulation motion, each<br>
transferred through a shaft. An articulation mechanism distally coupled to the shaft<br>
pivots an end elfector in response to the articulation motion. The end effector<br>
includes an elor gate channel coupled to the shaft, an anvil that is pivotally coupled to<br>
the elongate channel and that is responsive to the closing motion from the shaft. A<br>
firing device has a distally presented cutting ecge longitudinally received between the<br>
elongate channel and the anvil. An articulation mechanism pivots the elongate<br>
channel from the shaft in response to the articulation motion. A pair of support plates<br>
flank the firing mechanism across the articulation mechanism, each support plate<br>
including an en i springedly engaged to a frame recess formed in the articulation<br>
mechanism. Thereby, an improved stapling and severing instrument may incorporate<br>
a firing device that withstands high firing loads yet does not introduce significantly<br>
increased firing forces when articulated.<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
Turning to the Drawings, wherein like numerals denote like components<br>
throughout the several views, FIGS. 1-3 depict a surgical instrument, which in the<br>
illustrative embodiment is more particularly a surgical stapling and severing<br>
instrument 10, that is capable of practicing the unique benefits of the present<br>
invention. In particular, the surgical stapling and severing instrument 10 is sized for<br>
insertion, in a no larticulated state as depicted in FIG. 1, through a trocar cannula<br>
passageway to a surgical site in a patient for performing a surgical procedure. Once<br>
an articulation mechanism 11 and a distally attached end effector 12 are inserted<br>
through the cannula passageway, the articulation mechanism 11 may be remotely<br>
articulated, as depicted in FIG. 2, by an articulation control 13. Thereby, the er.d<br>
effector 12 may teach behind an organ or approach tissue from a desired angle or for<br>
other reasons. For instance, a firing mechanism, advantageously depicted as an E-<br>
beam firing bar 14 (depicted in FIG. 3), that severs clamped tissue., engages an<br>
elongate channel 16 and a pivotally attached anvil 18.<br>
 The surgical and stapling and severing instrument 10 includes a handle portion<br>
20 connected tc an implement portion 22, the latter further comprising a shaft 23<br>
distally terminating in the articulating mechanism 11 and the end effector 12. The<br>
handle portion 20 includes a pistol grip 24 toward which a closure trigger 26 is<br>
pivotally drawn by the clinician to cause clamping, or closing, of the anvil 18 toward<br>
the elongate channel 16 of the end effector 12. A firing trigger 28 is farther outboard<br>
of the closure trigger 26 and is pivotally drawn by the clinician to cause the stapling<br>
and severing of clamped tissue in the end effector 12. Thereafter, a release button 30<br>
is depressed to release the clamped tissue.<br>
h An outermost closure sleeve 32 of the shaft 23 longitudinally translates in<br>
response to the closure trigger 26 to pivotally close the anvil 18. Specifically, a distal<br>
portion, or closure ring 33, of the closure sleeve 32 with respectto the articulation<br>
mechanism 11is indirectly supported by a frame 34 of the implement portion 22<br>
(partially visible at the articulation mechanism 11). At the articulation mechanism 11,<br>
a proximal portion, or closure tube 35, of the closure sleeve 32 communicates with the<br>
distal portion (c.osure ring) 33. The frame 34 is flexibly attached to the elongate<br>
channel 16 viatne articulation mechanism 11, enabling articulation in a single plane.<br>
The frame 34 also longitudinally slidingly supports a firing drive member 36 that<br>
communicates a firing motion from the firing trigger 28 to the firing bar 14. Only the<br>
firing bar 14 of he firing drive member 36 is depicted FIG. 3, but the firing drive<br>
member 36 is described below further detail with regard to various versions of a<br>
rotationally controlled articulation mechanism 11.<br>
 It will be appreciated that the terms "proximal" and "distal" are used herein<br>
with reference to a clinician gripping a handle of an instrument. Thus, the end<br>
effector 12 is distal with respect to the more proximal handle portion 20. It will be<br>
further appreciated that for convenience and clarity, spatial terms such as "vertical"<br>
and "horizontal' are used herein with respect to the drawings. However, surgical<br>
instruments are used in many orientations and positions, and these terms are not<br>
intended to be limiting and absolute.<br>
 E-BEAMFIRING BAR<br>
FIGS. 3-5 depict the end effector 12 employing the E-beam firing bar 14 to<br>
perform a number of functions. In FIG. 3, the firing bar 14 is proximally positioned,<br>
allowing an unspent staple cartridge 37 to be installed into the elongate channel 16.<br>
In particular, an upper pin 38 of the firing bar 14 resides within a recess, depicted as<br>
an anvil pocket 40 allowing the anvil 18 to be repeatedly opened and closed. With the<br>
end effector closed as depicted in FIG. 4, the firing bar 14 is advanced in engagement<br>
with the anvil 18 by having the upper pin 38 enter a longitudinal anvil slot 42. A<br>
lower most pin, or firing bar cap 44, engaged a lower surface of the elongate channel<br>
16 by having the firing bar 14 extend through a channel slot 45. A middle pin 46<br>
slidingly engages a top surface of the elongate channel 16, cooperating with the firing<br>
bar cap 44. Thereby, the firing bar 14 affirmatively spaces the end effector 12 during<br>
firing, overcoming pinching that may occur with a minimal amount of clamped tissue<br>
and overcoming staple malformation with an excessive amount of clamped tissue.<br>
During firing, a distally presented cutting edge 48 between the upper pin 38<br>
and middle pin 45 of the firing bar enters a proximally presented vertical slot 49 of the<br>
staple cartridge 37, severing tissue clamped between the staple cartridge 37 and the<br>
anvil 18. As shown in FIG. 4, the middle pin 46 actuates the staple cartridge 37 by<br>
entering into a firing slot within the staple cartridge 37, driving a wedge sled 41 into<br>
upward camming contact with staple drivers 43 that in turn drive a plurality of staples<br>
47 out of staple apertures 51 in the staple cartridge 37 into forming contact with staple<br>
pockets 53 on an inner surface of the anvil 18. FIG. 5 depicts the firing bar 14 fully<br>
distally translatec after completing severing and stapling tissue.<br>
TWO-AX IS HANDLE<br>
- With reference to FIGS. 6-7, the handle portion 20 is comprised of first and<br>
second base sections 50 and 52, which are molded from a polymeric material such as<br>
a glass-filled polycarbonate. The first base section 50 is provided with a plurality of<br>
cylindrical-shaped pins 54. The second base section 52 includes a plurality of<br>
extending members 56, each having a hexagonal-shaped opening 58. The cylindrical-<br>
shaped pins 54 are received within the hexagonal-shaped openings 58 and are<br>
fictionally held therein for maintaining the fir3t and second base sections 50 and 52<br>
in assembly.<br>
 A housing cap 60 has a bore 62 extending completely through it for engaging<br>
and rotating the implement portion 22 about its longitudinal axis. The housing cap 60<br>
includes an inwardly protruding boss 64 extending along at least a portion of the bore<br>
62. The protruc ing boss 64 is received within a longitudinal slot 66 formed at a<br>
proximal portion of the closure sleeve 32 such that rotation of the housing cap 60<br>
effects rotation of the closure sleeve 32. It will be appreciated that the boss 64 further<br>
extends through frame 34 and into contact witit a portion of the firing drive member<br>
36 to effect the rotation as well. Thus, the end effector 12 (not shown in FIGS. 3-4)<br>
rotates with the housing cap 60.<br>
A proximal end 6$ of the frame 34 passes proximally through the housing cap<br>
60 and is provided with a circumferential notch 70 that is engaged by opposing<br>
channel securentent members 72 extending respectively from the base sections 50 and<br>
52. Only the channel securement member 72 c f the second base section 52 is shown.<br>
The channel securement members 72 extending from the base sections 50, 52 serve to<br>
secure the frame 34 to the handle portion 20 such thatthe frame 34 does not move<br>
longitudinally relative to the handle portion 20.<br>
The clos ure trigger 26 has a handle section 74, a gear segment section 76, and<br>
an intermediate section 78. A bore 80 extends through the intermediate section 78. A<br>
cylindrical support member 82 extending from the second base section 52 passes<br>
through the bore 80 for pivotally mounting the closure trigger 26 on the handle<br>
portion 20. A se ;ond cylindrical support member 83 extending from the second base<br>
section 52 passes through a bore 81 of firing trigger 28 for pivotally mounting on the<br>
handle portion 20. A hexagonal opening 84 is provided in the cylindrical support<br>
member 83 for receiving a securement pin (not shown) extending from the first base<br>
section 50.<br>
A closure yoke 86 is housed within the handle portion 20 for reciprocating<br>
movement there n and serves to transfer motion from the closure trigger 26 to the<br>
closure sleeve 32. Support members 88 extending from the second base section 52<br>
and securement Member 72, which extends through a recess 89 in the yoke 86,<br>
support the yoke 86 within the handle portion 20.<br>
A proximal end 90 of the closure sleeve 32 is provided with a flange 92 that is<br>
snap-fitted into a receiving recess 94 formed in a distalend 96 of the yoke 86. A<br>
proximal end 98 of the yoke 86 has a gear rack '. 00 that is engaged by the gear<br>
segment section 76 of the closure trigger 26. When the closure trigger 26 is moved<br>
toward the pistol grip 24 of the handle portion 2D, the yoke 86 and, hence, the closure<br>
sleeve 32 move c istally, compressing a spring 102 that biases the yoke 86 proximally.<br>
Distal movement of the closure sleeve 32 effects pivotal translation movement of the<br>
anvil 18 distal ly and toward the elongate channel 16 of the end effector 12 and<br>
proximal movement effects closing, as discussed below.<br>
The closure trigger 26 is forward biased to an open position by a front surface<br>
130 interacting v ith an engaging surface 128 of the firing trigger 28. Clamp first<br>
hook 104 that pilots top to rear in the handle portion 20 about a pin 106 restrains<br>
movement of the firing trigger 28 toward the pistol grip 24 until the closure trigger 26<br>
is clamped to its closed position. Hook 104 restrains firing trigger 28 motion by<br>
engaging a lockcut pin 107 in firing trigger 28. The hook 104 is also in contact with<br>
the closure trigger 26. In particular, a forward projection 108 of the hook 104<br>
engages a member 110 on the intermediate section 78 of the closure trigger 26, the<br>
member 110 being outward of the bore 80 toward the handle section 74. Hook 104 is<br>
biased toward contact with member 11 Oof the closure trigger 26 and engagement with<br>
lockout pin 1C7 in firing trigger 28 by a release spring 112. As the closure trigger 26<br>
is depressed, the hook 104 is moved top to rear, compressing the release spring 112<br>
that is captured t etween a rearward projection 114 on the hook 104 and a forward<br>
projection 116 on the release button 30.<br>
As the ycke 86 moves distally in response to proximal movement of the<br>
closure trigger 26, an upper latch arm 118 of the release button 30 moves along an<br>
upper surface 12 0 on the yoke 86 until dropping into an upwardly presented recess<br>
122 in a proxima1, lower portion of the yoke 86 The release spring 112 urges the<br>
release button 30 outward, which pivots the upper latch arm 118 downwardly into<br>
engagement with the upwardly presented recess 122, thereby locking the closure<br>
trigger 26 in a t ssue clamping position.<br>
The latch arm 118 can be moved out of the recess 122 to release the anvil 18<br>
by pushing the release button 30 inward. Specifically, the upper latch arm 118 pivots<br>
upward about p :n 123 of the second base section 52. The yoke 86 is then permitted to<br>
move proximally in response to return movement of the closure trigger 26.<br>
A firing trigger return spring 124 is located within the handle portion 20 with<br>
one end attached to pin 106 of the second base section 52 and the other end attached<br>
to a pin 126 on the firing trigger 28. The firing return spring 124 applies a return<br>
force to the pin 126 for biasing the firing trigger 28 in a direction away from the pistol<br>
grip 24 of the handle portion 20. The closure trigger 26 is also biased away from<br>
pistol grip 24 by engaging surface 128 of firing trigger 28 biasing front surface 130 of<br>
closure trigger 26.<br>
As the c osure trigger 26 is moved toward the pistol grip 24, its front surface<br>
130 engages with the engaging surface 128 on the firing trigger 28 causing the firing<br>
trigger 28 to move to its "firing" position. When in its firing position, the firing<br>
trigger 28 is located at an angle of approximately 45° to the pistol grip 24. After<br>
staple firing, the spring 124 causes the firing trigger 28 to return to its initial position.<br>
During the return movement of the firing trigger 28, its engaging surface 128 pushes<br>
against the front surface 130 of the closure trigger 26 causing the closure trigger 26 to<br>
return to its initial position. A stop member 132 extends from the second base section<br>
52 to prevent the closure trigger 26 from rotating beyond its initial position.<br>
The surgical stapling and severing instrament 10 additionally includes a<br>
reciprocating section 134, a multiplier 136 and a drive member 138. The<br>
reciprocating section 134 comprises a wedge sled, or wedge sled, in the implement<br>
portion 22 (not shown in FIG. 6-7) and a metal drive rod 140.<br>
The drive member 138 includes first and second gear racks 141 and 142. A<br>
first notch 144 is provided on the drive member 138 intermediate the first and second<br>
gear racks 141, 42. During return movement of the firing trigger 28, a tooth 146 on<br>
the firing trigger 28 engages with the first notch 144 for returning the drive member<br>
138 to its initial position after staple firing. A second notch 148 is located at a<br>
proximal end of the metal drive rod 140 for locking the metal drive rod 140 to the<br>
upper latch arm 118 of the release button 30 in its unfired position.<br>
 The mul iplier 136 comprises first and second integral pinion gears 150 and<br>
152. The first integral pinion gear 150 is engaged with a first gear rack 154 provided<br>
on the metal drive rod 140. The second integral pinion gear 152 is engaged with the<br>
first gear rack 141 on the drive member 138. The first integral pinion gear 150 has a<br>
first diameter and the second integral pinion gear 152 has a second diameter that is<br>
smaller than the first diameter.<br>
ROTATIONAL ARTICULATION CONTROL<br>
With reference to FIGS. 6-9, the handle portion 20 advantageously<br>
incorporates the articulation control 13 that both rotates the implement portion 22<br>
about the longitudinal axis of the surgical instrument 1,0 and articulates the end<br>
effector 12 to an angle with the longitudinal axis. A hollow articulation drive tube 200<br>
is concentrically located within the closure sleeve 32 and is operably coupled to an<br>
actuation lever 202 such that rotation of actuation lever 202 rotates tube 200 about the<br>
longitudinal axis and causes perpendicular rotation or articulation of the closure ring<br>
250 and end effector 12. This articulation of the closure ring 250 corresponds to the<br>
degree and direction of rotation of actuator lever 202 viewed and manipulated by the<br>
clinician. In the illustrative version, the relationship is one to one, with the degree of<br>
rotation of the actuator lever 202 corresponding to the degree of articulation from the<br>
longitudinal axis of the shaft 23, thus providing an intuitive indication to the clinician.<br>
It will be apprec: ated that other angular relationships may be selected.<br>
The articalation control 13 includes a pair of mirrored articulation<br>
transmission horsings 204 that are attached to the housing cap 60. Moreover, the<br>
articulation transmission housing 204 includes longitudinally aligned external tabs<br>
206 that a clinician twists to effect rotation of the articulation transmission housing<br>
204, and thus of :he end effector 12, about the longitudinal axis of the implement<br>
portion 22. The actuator lever 202 is attached to a cylindrical articulation body 208<br>
that resides within a cylindrical recess 210 opening generally upward and<br>
perpendicular to the shaft 23. The lowermost portion of the articulation body 208<br>
includes prongs 212 that snap fit into an opening 214 in the articulation transmission<br>
housing 208 near to the shaft 23, the prongs 212 preventing the articulation body 208<br>
from being withdrawn from the cylindrical recess 210.<br>
 Annularly presented gear teeth 216 are located about the lower portion of the<br>
articulation body 208 and mesh with teeth 218 on an articulation yoke 220. The<br>
articulation yoke 220 straddles an articulation rectangular window 222 formed in the<br>
closure sleeve 52. Closure sleeve 32 is slidably moveable within the articulation<br>
control 13 (in the longitudinal direction) to close and open the end effector 12. The<br>
articulation drive tube 200 moves longitudinally with the closure sleeve 32 relative to<br>
the fixed articu ation control 13. Window 222 provides clearance for a boss 224<br>
inwardly preset ted from the articulation yoke 220 that passes through the rectangular<br>
window 222 to engage a slot 226 in the articulation drive tube 2.00, longitudinally<br>
positioning the articulation drive tube 200 for rotational motion. The hollow<br>
articulation drive tube 200 extends longitudinally within the closure sleeve 32 from<br>
the articulation mechanism 11 and terminates distally before the locking tabs 227 of<br>
the closure sleeve 32. The tabs 227 are inwardly bent behind the proximal face of the<br>
articulation drive tube 200 and thereby retaining the articulation drive tube 200 in the<br>
shaft 23.<br>
It shoulc. be appreciated that the articulation transmission housing 204 is<br>
operatively associated to the closure tube 35 of the shaft 23. The housing cap 60<br>
retains the articulation yoke 220 in the articulation transmission housing 204 and<br>
retains the articulation control 13 within the handle portion 20 by presenting<br>
proximally an o Jter diameter circular groove 228 that engages a circular inward lip<br>
230 at the distal opening of the assembled base sections 50, 52.<br>
FIGS. 10 and 11 depict the gear articulation mechanism 11 of FIGS. 1-2 in the<br>
form of a spur gear articulation mechanism 240, which is generally the same as<br>
described above but with additional articulation driving components on the other side<br>
of the articulation mechanism 240 to thereby increase performance. Articulation<br>
mechanism 240 has a rotatable hollow articulation drive tube 242 that is<br>
concentrically located within closure sleeve 32 and has a distally projecting gear<br>
section 244 about a first circumference portion 246. Gear section 244 meshes with a<br>
spur gear 248 at ached to and proximally projecting from closure ring 250 which<br>
pivots about pins 253 extending through first and second pivot points 252, 260<br>
projecting distal ly from the closure sleeve 32. Thus, an articulation pivot axis passes<br>
through both the first and second pivot points 252,260 and pins 253 rotatably couple<br>
closure ring 250 to the closure sleeve 32. Rotation of drive 242 engages the gears 242<br>
and 248 and articulates closure ring 250 about first and second pivot points 252, 260.<br>
To increase the effective surface area of gear contact between the hollow<br>
articulation driv i tube 242 and the closure ring 250, a second circumference portion<br>
254 of the hollo v articulation drive tube 242 has a recessed distally projecting gear<br>
section 256 extending therefrom. Gear section 256 is operably coupled to a second<br>
spur gear 258 at ached to and proximally projecting from an opposite lateral side of<br>
the closure ring 250 by a reversing gear 262 pivotally supported by the frame 34.<br>
Reversing gear 262 engages both the recessed distally projecting gear section 256 on<br>
one side and the second spur gear 258 of the closure ring 250 on the other.<br>
When the closure trigger 26 is actuated, both the hollow articulation drive tube<br>
242 and pivotally attached closure tube 250 of the closure sleeve 32 are moved<br>
distally to close the anvil 18. The closure tube 35 of the closure sleeve 32 is spaced<br>
away from the cosure ring 33 by pivot points 252, 260 pinned to pivot holes 264 and<br>
266 centered in spur gears 248,258, and a frame opening 268 that extends<br>
therethrough. T he frame opening 268 provides clearance so that the proximal edges<br>
of the closure ring 33 and the distal edges of the closure tube 35 of the closure sleeve<br>
32 do not collide during articulation.<br>
 FIG. 11 depicts in disassembled form an implement portion 270 that includes<br>
the spur gear artculation mechanism 240. A frame 272 is longitudinally attachable to<br>
the handle portion 20 (depicted in FIGS. 1 and 2) with a bushing 274 on its proximal<br>
end for rotatingly engagement thereto. A frame trough 276 formed by an opening 278<br>
longitudinally aligned with the center of the frame 272 is longer than a firing<br>
connector 280 that slides longitudinally within the frame trough 276. The proximal<br>
end of the firing connector 280 rotatingly engages the distal end of the metal drive bar<br>
140 (depicted in FIG 6). The distal end of the firing connector 280 includes a slot 282<br>
that receives a proximal end of the firing bar 14, attached therein by pins 284. A<br>
more distal porticn of the firing bar 14 is positioned within a lower groove 286 in a<br>
firing bar slotted guide 288 that is distally engaged with an articulating frame member<br>
290 and the frame 272.<br>
Articulating frame member 290 has a channel-anchoring member 292 that<br>
distally attaches to an attachment collar 294 of a proximal portion in the elongate<br>
channel 16. The firing bar 14 passes through a lower slot 295 in the articulating<br>
frame member 290. The articulating frame member 290 is spaced away from the<br>
distal end of the f rame 272 by the firing bar slotted guide 288 and flexibly attached<br>
thereto for articulation by a resilient connector 296. A widened proximal end 298 of<br>
the resilient connector 296 engages a distally communicating top recess 300 in the<br>
distal end of the frame 272 and a widened distal end 302 of the resilient connector 296<br>
engages a proximally communicating top recess 304 in the articulating frame member<br>
290. Thereby, the elongate channel 16 is attached to the handle portion 20, albeit with<br>
a flexible portion therebetween.<br>
The elongate channel 16 also has an anvil cam slot 306 that pivotally receives<br>
an anvil pivot 308 of the anvil 18. The closure ring 250 that encompasses the<br>
articulating frame member 290 includes a distally presented tab 310 that engages an<br>
anvil feature 312 proximate but distal to the anvil pivot 308 on the anvil 18 to thereby<br>
effect opening. When the closure ring 250 is moved forward, its distally presented<br>
closing face 314 contacts a ramped cylindrical closing face 316, which is distal to tab<br>
312 of the anvil 18. This camming action closes the anvil 18 downward until the<br>
closing face 314 of the closure ring 250 contacts a flat cylindrical face 318 of the<br>
anvil 18.<br>
SUPPORT PLATES<br>
FIGS. 12-13 depict the articulation mechanism 240 along the articulation pivot<br>
axis illustrating flexible support structures between the shaft 23 and the end effector<br>
12 and a construction of the firing bar 14 that advantageously performs severing yet is<br>
flexible enough for articulation. The hollow articulation drive tube 242 engages the<br>
spur gear 248 of 1he closure ring 33. Omitted from this view are the proximal portion<br>
35 of the closure sleeve 32 (i.e., closure tube 35) that longitudinally positions for<br>
articulation the spur gear 248 at an upper pivot point 252 and the lower pivot point<br>
260.<br>
Resilient support in the articulation mechanism 240 allow articulation about<br>
the articulation pivot axis includes a pair of support plates 400,402 that flank a<br>
proximal portion of the firing bar 14 to prevent buckling as they pass through the<br>
frame opening 268. Thus, the firing bar 14 is capable of transferring large loads while<br>
being flexible. This proximal portion of the firing bar 14 is depicted as an elongate<br>
tapered firing atrip 404 formed as one or more flat blades of spring material that are<br>
aligned for flexing about the articulation pivot axis. This tapered firing strip 404<br>
transitioned to a thicker distal portion, depicted as a firing bar head 406, that includes<br>
the cutting edge 48, upper pin 38, middle pin 46 and firing bar cap 44 (pins omitted in<br>
FIG. 12). This thicker firing bar head 406 has ircreased thickness to resist deflection<br>
during firing, thereby ensuring an effective seve:ring and actuation of the staple<br>
cartridge 37. The thinner cross section of the tapered firing strip 404 is more<br>
susceptible to buckling when subjected to peak firing loads. The support plates 400,<br>
402 advantageously mitigate the effects of peak firing loads in the tapered firing strip<br>
404 by supporting the tapered firing strip 404 through the articulation joint to prevent<br>
buckling of the firing bar 14. Support plates 400, 420 are longitudinally moveable<br>
within both of the proximal and distal sides 408, 410 of the articulation mechanism<br>
240.<br>
As showr in FIG. 12, the pair of support plates 400, 402 each have a proximal<br>
and distal sliding spring ends 412,414, received respectively by a frame pocket 416 in<br>
the frame 32 and an end frame pocket 418 in the articulating frame member 290.<br>
These pockets 416, 418 provide clearance for the spring ends 412, 414 of the support<br>
plates 400, 402 to move within as the articulation mechanism 240 articulates,<br>
lessening the frarne opening 268 toward the inside and lengthening the frame opening<br>
268 toward the outside. Reversing the direction of articulation of the end effector 12<br>
reverses movement of the spring ends 412, 414 (not shown). Insofar as the proximal<br>
spring ends 412 tend not to be rigidly engaged to a distal extreme surface 420 of the<br>
frame pocket 416, the support plates 400,402 are able to springedly move distally in<br>
response to a peak firing load in the firing bar 14.<br>
By contrast, FIGS. 14-15 depict known Prior Art support members 421, 422<br>
formed from a spring material that rigidly attach to a proximal side 423 and slidingly<br>
contact a distal side 424 of a known articulation mechanism 425. In FIG. 14, the<br>
instrument is shown straight or un-articulated and a pair of free or distal ends 429 of<br>
the support plates 421, 422 are centered within end frame pockets 418 and fixed ends<br>
427,428 are fixedly attached to proximal side 423. With particular reference to FIG.<br>
15, the end effector is shown articulated and a firing bar 426 and support plates<br>
421,422 are ben from the articulation. Since the support plates 421,422 are spring<br>
cantilever beams, they contact the firing bar 426 as shown and the free or distal ends<br>
429 of the support plates 421,422 move proximally and distally, respectively, within<br>
end frame pockets 418. The contact of the free or distal ends 429 of support plates<br>
421,422 with the firing bar can induce drag loads and increase the force needed to<br>
move the firing bar 426.<br>
FIG. 16 depicts support plates 430, 432 that alternatively each include a<br>
rigidly attached proximal ends 434 and a springedly attached distal ends 436 in the<br>
end frame pocket 418 by opposing compression springs 438 engaging each end 436.<br>
Springedly attac ling the distal ends 436 to the frame pockets 418 provides additional<br>
control of the free distal ends to reduce drag on the firing bar 14 and enables the ends<br>
436 to move longitudinally during articulation. Alternatively, the spring attachment<br>
provided by the ;ompression springs 438 may be reversed, engaging the proximal<br>
ends 434 with the distal ends 436 rigidly attached.<br>
FIG. 17 depict the support plates 430, 432 of FIG. 16 with a resilient member<br>
440 engaging each the distal ends 436 of each support plate 430, 432. Alternatively,<br>
the resilient attachment by the resilient members 440 may be reversed, engaging the<br>
proximal ends 434 with the distal ends 436 rigidly attached. Resilient members may<br>
be formed from various elastomeric materials such as silicone, rubber, buna-n or any<br>
one of a number of known elastomers that behave elastically. Foam materials can<br>
also act as a spri ng and can include closed or open cell foams formed from a wide<br>
variety of materials such as silicone foams, rubber based foams or polyethylene<br>
foams.<br>
 FIGS. 18-19 depict support plates 442, 444 that include inner and outer bent<br>
spring fingers 446,448 that springedly engage the end frame pocket 418 so that the<br>
spring plates 442, 444 absorb peak firing loads from the firing bar 14. Alternatively,<br>
the spring engagement may be reversed, with the proximal ends 434 including inner<br>
and outer bent spring fingers 446, 448 engaging a proximal frame pocket 416 (not<br>
depicted in FIGS. 18-19) with the distal ends 436 rigidly attached. FIG. 19 depicts<br>
how additional flexibility may be obtained along the span of the support plate 442,<br>
442 by introduci ng openings 450 therein.<br>
 FIG. 20 depicts the support plates 430,432 of FIG. 16 with both a frame<br>
pocket 416 and an end frame pocket 418 incorporating opposing compression springs<br>
438 to further m tigate the effects of firing bar loads.<br>
FIG. 21 cepicts the support plates 430, 432 of FIG. 17 with both a frame<br>
pocket 416 and an end frame pocket 418 incorporating resilient members 440 to<br>
further mitiga:e the effects of firing loads on the firing bar 14.<br>
FIG. 22 depicts support plates 452,454 ihat include inner and outer bent<br>
spring fingers 446,448 on both ends that springedly engage both, a frame pocket 416<br>
and an end frame pocket 418 to further mitigate the effects of firing bar loads.<br>
FIG. 23 depicts resilient support plates 456,458 that each engage frame<br>
pocket 416 and end frame pocket 418 to adjust to the changes in spacing on the inside<br>
and outside of the frame opening 268 by expanding or compressing in response<br>
thereto. Resilient support plates can be made from a number of materials with<br>
flexible or elastomeric properties including; silicone, rubber, buna-n Isoplast or any<br>
one of a number of known elastomers that behave elastically or resiliently.<br>
 FIG. 24 is an exploded view of low friction support plates 460, 462 that<br>
incorporate bearings 464 to reduce frictional forces between the firing bar 14 and the<br>
support plates 460, 462. The support plates 460, 462 have dimpled openings 466<br>
respectively for the reception of bearings 464 to hold them into contact with the firing<br>
bar 14. Alternatively, cylindrical bearings may be incorporated with the cylindrical<br>
bearings oriented for distal movement of the firing bar 14.<br>
While thc present invention has been illustrated by description of several<br>
embodiments and while the illustrative embodiments have been described in<br>
considerable detail, it is not the intention of the applicant to restrict or in any way<br>
limit the scope of the appended claims to such detail. Additional advantages and<br>
modifications may readily appear to those skilled in the art.<br>
- The present invention has been discussed in terms of endoscopic procedures<br>
and apparatus. However, use herein of terms such as "endoscopic", should not be<br>
construed to limit the present invention to a surgical stapling and severing instrument<br>
for use only in conjunction with an endoscopic tube (i.e., trocar). On the contrary, it<br>
is believed that the present invention may find use in any procedure where access is<br>
limited to a small incision, including but not limited to laparoscopic procedures, as<br>
well as open procedures.<br>
For another example, although the E-beam firing beam 14 has advantages for<br>
an endoscopically employed surgical severing and stapling instrument 10, a similar E-<br>
Beam may be used in other clinical procedures. It is generally accepted that<br>
endoscopic procedures are more common than laparoscopic procedures. Accordingly,<br>
the present invention has been discussed in terms of endoscopic procedures and<br>
apparatus. However, use herein of terms such as "endoscopic", should not be<br>
construed to limit the present invention to a surgical stapling and severing instrument<br>
for use only in conjunction with an endoscopic tabe (i.e., trocar). On the contrary, it<br>
is believed that the present invention may find use in any procedure where access is<br>
limited to a small incision, including but not limited to laparoscopic procedures, as<br>
well as open procedures.<br>
For yet another example, although an illustrative handle portion 20 described<br>
herein is manually operated by a clinician, it is consistent with aspects of the<br>
invention for some or all of the functions of a handle portion to be powered (e.g.,<br>
pneumatic, hydraulic, electromechanical, ultrasonic, etc.). Furthermore, controls of<br>
each of these functions may be manually presented on a handle portion or be remotely<br>
controlled (e.g., wireless remote, automated remote console, etc.).<br>
 As yet an additional example, although a simultaneous stapling and severing<br>
instrument is advantageously illustrated herein, it would be consistent with aspects of<br>
the invention supporting a firing mechanism through an articulating shaft with other<br>
types of end effectors, such as cutters, staplers, clip applier, access device, drug/gene<br>
therapy delivery device, and a energy device using ultrasound, RF, laser, etc.<br>
For example, various combinations of rigidly attached, resiliently attached,<br>
and springedly a:tached support plate ends may be used, such as resilient attached<br>
proximal end and a springedly attached distal end.<br><br>
