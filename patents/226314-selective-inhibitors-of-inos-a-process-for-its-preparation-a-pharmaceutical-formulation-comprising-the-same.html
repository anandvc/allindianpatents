The present invention relates to amidino sulphone derivatives, which are<br>
selective inhibitors of iNOS, a process for its preparation, a pharmaceutical formulation comprising the same.<br>
It has been known since the early 1980's that the vascular relaxation brought about by acetylcholine is dependent on the presence of the endothelium and this activity was ascribed to a labile humoral factor termed endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF). The activity of glyceryl trinitrate as a vasodilator has been known for well over 100 years and it is now known that NO is the active component of amylnitrite, glyceryltrinitrite and other nitrovasodilators. The recent identification of EDRF as NO has coincided with the discovery of a biochemical pathway by which NO is synthesised from the amino acid L-arginine by the enzyme NO synthase.<br>
NO is the endogenous stimulator of the soluble guanylate cyclase enzyme and is involved in a number of biological actions in addition to endothelium-dependent relaxation including cytotoxicity of phagocytic cells and cell-to-cell communication in the central nervous system (see Moncada et al, Biochemical Pharmacology, 38, 1709-1715 (1989) and Moncada et al. Pharmacological Reviews, 43, 109-142 (1991)). It is now thought that excess NO production may be involved in a number of conditions, including conditions which involve systemic hypotension such as septic shock and therapy with certain cytokines, and many inflammatory diseases such as arthritis.<br>
The synthesis of NO from L-arginine can be inhibited by the L-arginine analogue, NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA), and the therapeutic use of L-NMMA for the treatment of septic (toxic) shock and other types of systemic hypotension has been proposed (WO 91/04024 and GB-A-2240041). The therapeutic use of certain other NO synthase inhibitors apart from L-NMMA for the same purpose has also been proposed in WO 91/04024 and in EP-A-0446699.<br>
It has recently become apparent that there are at least three isoenzymes of NO synthase (reviewed in Knowles and Moncada, Biochem. J. (1994) 298, 249-258) as follows:<br>
(i) a constitutive, Ca++ /cahnoduiin dependent enzyme (eNOS) which is present in vascular endothelial cells, and that releases NO in response to receptor or physical stimulation.<br><br>
(ii) a constitutive, Ca++ /calmodulin dependent enzyme (nNOS), located in the brain and some peripheral nervous systems, that releases NO in response to receptor or physical stimulation.<br>
(iii) a Ca++ independent enzyme (iNOS) which is induced after activation of vascular smooth muscle, macrophages, endothelial cells, and a number of other cells by endotoxin and cytokines. Once expressed this inducible NO synthase synthesises NO for long periods.<br>
The NO released by eNOS and nNOS acts as a transduction mechanism underlying several physiological responses. The NO produced by iNOS acts as a cytotoxic molecule for invading microorganisms. It also appears that the adverse effects of excess NO production, in particular pathological vasodilation, vascular leakage and tissue damage, may result largely from the effects of NO synthesised by iNOS.<br>
The NO synthase inhibitors proposed for therapeutic use so far, such as L-NMMA and nitroarginine, are non-selective in that they inhibit all the NO synthase isoenzymes. Use of â–  such a non-selective NO synthase inhibitor requires that great care is taken in order to avoid the potentially serious consequences of over-inhibition of the eNOS including hypertension and possible thrombosis and tissue damage. In particular, in the case of the therapeutic use of L-NMMA for the treatment of septic and/or toxic shock it has been recommended that the patient must be subject to continuous blood pressure monitoring throughout the treatment. Thus, whilst non-selective NO synthase inhibitors have therapeutic utility provided that appropriate precautions are taken, NO synthase inhibitors which are selective in the sense that they inhibit iNOS to a considerably greater extent than eNOS would be of even greater therapeutic benefit and much easier to use.<br>
Patent application WO 93/13055    discloses a group of amidino derivatives of the formula (0) <br>
and salts, and pharmaceutically acceptable esters and amides thereof, in which:<br>
R1 is a C1-6 strdght or branched chain alkyl group, a C2.6alkenyl group, a C2.6alkynyl group, a C3.6cycloalkyi group or a Cs^cycloalkyl C1.6alkyl group;<br><br>
Q is an alkylene, alkenylene or alkynylene group having 3 to 6 carbon atoms and which may optionally be substituted by one or more Ci.3allcyl groups; or Q is a group of formula -(CH2)pX(CH2)q- where p is 2 or 3, q is 1 or 2 and X is S(0)x, where x is 0, 1 or 2, O or NR2 where R2 is H or Ci-gaikyl; or Q is a group of formula -(CH2)rA(CH2)s- where r is 0, 1 or 2, s is 0, 1 or 2 and A is a 3 to 6 membered carbocyclic or heterocyclic ring which may optionally be substituted by one or more suitable substituents such as Ci.6alkyl, Ci^alkoxy, hydroxy, halo, nitro, cyano, trifluoroCi,6allcyl, amino, Ci^alkylamino or diCi.6alkylamino which have activity as inhibitors of the NO synthase enzyme.<br>
The present inventors have found a particular group of compounds which are selective inhibitors of iNOS, having little or no effect on eNOS. Accordingly the present invention provides compounds of formula (I)<br>
wherein <br>
R   ' is methyl or fluoromethyl or a salt, ester, amide or physiologically acceptable prodrug thereof.<br>
Suitably R^ is Cj^ alkyl, C2.6 alkenyl or alkynyl or C3.6 cycloalkyl each group being optionally substituted by one to three groups independently selected from -CN; -NO2; a group -COR^a wherein R2a is hydrogen, C^ alkyl. hydroxy or amino; a group -S(0)mR63 wherein m is as hereinbefore defined and R^a is hydrogen, â‚¬{,4 alkyl, hydroxy or amino; a group -PO(OR9a)2 wherein R^a is hydrogen or C1.4 alkyl; a group NRlOaRl la wherein R^^* and R^ la are independently selected from hydrogen, C\^ alkyl, -C0Rl2a or S(0)mRl3a wherein m' is as hereinbefore defined and R^^a and R^^a are independently hydrogen or Ci^ alkyl; a group OR^^a wherein R^^a js hydrogen, Cj^ alkyl optionally substituted by one to three halo atoms, phenyl, benzyl or -COR^^a wherein Rl5a is hydrogen or C1.4 alkyl.<br><br>

â€¢ Most preferably R^ is a methyl or ethyl group optionally substituted by one to three substituents independently selected from halo, a group -OR14 wherein R14 is as hereinbefore defined or S(0)fnR^ wherein m and R6 are as hereinbefore defined.<br>
A preferred group of compounds are those of formula (lA)<br><br>
wherein R^ R^, p and q are as hereinbefore defined.<br>
Preferably R^ is unsubstituted or is substituted by only one group.<br>
Preferred compounds include;<br>
2-Amino-6-( 1 -iminoethylamino)-4,4-dioxo-4-thiahexanoic acid 2-Amino-6-( 1 -iminoethylamino)-4-oxo-4-thiahexanoic acid 2-Amino-7-(l-iminoethylamino)-5-oxo-5-thiaheptanoicacid 2-Amino-7-(l-iminoethylamino)-5,5-dioxo-5-thiaheptanoicacid<br><br>
In the alternative, the present invention provides a compound selected from 2-Anuno-6-(l-iniinoethylam!no)-4    4-dioxo-4-thiahexanoic acid<br>
and 2-Amino-6-(l-imino-2-fluoroethylamino)-4,4-dioxo-4-thiahexanoic acid. Preferably the compounds are in the R configuration.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) may include a number of asymmetric centres in the molecule depending on the precise meaning of the various groups and formula (I) is intended to include all possible isomers. The compounds of formula (I) all include an asymmetric centre in the <br>
group and although the natural L    chirality of arginine is preferred, it is again intended that the formula should include all possible isomers, either individually or admixed in any proportions.<br>
Suitable salts include those formed with both organic and inorganic acids. Such acid addition salts will normally be pharmaceutically acceptable although non-pharmaceutically acceptable salts may be of utility in the preparation and purification of the compound in question. Thus, preferred salts include those formed from hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulphuric, citric, tartaric, phosphoric, lactic, pyruvic, acetic, trifluoroacetic, succinic, oxalic, fumaric, maieic, oxaloacetic, methanesulphonic, ethanesulphonic, p-toluenesulphonic, benzenesulphonic and isethionic acids. Salts of the compounds of formula (I) can be made by reacting the appropriate compound in the form of the free base with the appropriate acid.<br>
Pharmaceutically acceptable esters and amides of the compounds of formula (I) may have the acid group replaced by -C02R'^ where R^ is for example Ci-galkyl, aryl or aryICi.3alkyl or -COR'^ where R'* is the residue of a suitable natural or synthetic amino acid.<br>
By the term physiologically acceptable prodrug is meant derivatives of compounds of formula (I) which have the same physiological function as the free compound of formula (I), for example, by being convertible in the body thereto. Such prodrugs may or may not have activity in their own right.<br>
A further aspect of the present invention also provides compounds of formula (I) as hereinbefore defined and all salts, esters, amides and physiologic^y acceptable<br><br>
prodrugs thereof, for use in medicine, in particular the treatment of conditions where there is an advantage in inhibiting NO production from L-arginine by the action of NO synthase and more specifically of conditions where there is an advantage in inhibiting NO production by the iNOS isoenzyme over production by eNOS.<br>
According to a further aspect, the present invention provides the use of a compound of formula (I) and all salts, esters, amides and physiologically acceptable prodrugs thereof, in the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of a condition where there is an advantage in inhibiting NO production from arginine by the action of NO synthase and, more specifically, by the action of iNOS.<br>
In a further aspect, there is provided the use of a compound of formula (I) or a salt, ester, amide or physiologically acceptable prodrug thereof in the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of shock states resulting from overproduction of NO by iNOS such as septic shock, or shock caused by fulminant hepatic failure or by therapy with cytokines such as TNF, IL-l and IL-2 or therapy with cytokine-inducing agents, for example 5, 6-dimethylxanthenone acetic acid.<br>
A further aspect of the present invention provides the use of a compound of formula (I) or a salt, ester, amide or physiologically acceptable prodrug thereof in the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of an inflammatory condition, such as arthritis.<br>
Other conditions where there is an advantage in selectively inhibiting iNOS include a wide range of auto-immune and/or inflammatory diseases, such as those of the joint (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis), of the gastrointestinal tract (e.g. ulcerative colitis and other inflammatory bowel diseases, gastritis and mucosal inflammation resulting from infection, the enteropathy provoked by non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs), of the lung (adult respiratory distress syndrome, asthma), of the heart (myocarditis), of the nervous tissue (e.g. multiple sclerosis), of the pancreas (e.g. diabetes melitus), of the kidney (e.g. glomerulonephritis), of the skin (e.g. dermatitis, psoriasis, urticaria) as well as of transplanted organs (rejection) and multi-organ diseases (e.g. systemic lupus erythematosis). Furthermore there is evidence for overproduction of NO by iNOS in atherosclerosis.<br>
Therefore, a yet fiirther aspect of the present invention provides the use of a compound of formula (I) or a salt, ester, amide or physiologically acceptable prodrug thereof in the manufacture of a medicament for use in treating the above conditions.<br><br>
Inhibition of nNOS and/or iNOS is of benefit in the treatment of diseases of the nervous system due to over production of NO by this isoenzyme, particularly the treatment of cerebral ischemia. Other diseases include CNS trauma, epilepsy, AIDS dementia, chronic neurodegenerative disease and chronic pain, and conditions in which non-adrenergic non-cholinergic nerve may be implicated such as priapism, obesity and hyperphagia. Accordingly the present invention also provides the use of a compound of formula (I) or a salt, ester, amide or physiologically acceptable prodrug thereof in the manufacture of a medicament for use in treating the above conditions.<br>
Furthermore inhibition of NO synthase may be of advantage in preventing the lymphocyte loss associated with HIV infection, in increasing the radiosensitivity of tumours during radiotherapy and in reducing tumour growth and metastasis.<br>
â€¢ Inhibition of both iNOS and nNOS may be of benefit in the treatment of certain conditions where both isoenzymes play a role, for example CNS conditions such as cerebral ischemia.<br>
As used herein, reference to "treatment" of a patient is intended to include prophylaxis; the term "mammal" is intended to include a human or an animal.<br>
The activity of compounds of formula (I) and all salts, esters, amides and physiologically acceptable prodrugs thereof as NO synthase inhibitors can be determined using isolated human or rodent enzymes, the rat aortic ring or in vivo in mice according to the methods described hereinafter.<br>
Whilst it may be possible for the compounds of formula (I) and all salts, esters, amides and physiologically acceptable prodrugs thereof to be administered as the raw chemical, it is preferable to present them as a pharmaceutical formulation. According to a further aspect, the present invention provides a pharmaceutical formulation comprising a compound of formula (I) and all salts, esters, amides and physiologically acceptable prodrugs thereof, together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers therefor and optionally one or more other therapeutic ingredients. The carrier(s) must be "acceptable" in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not deleterious to the recipient thereof<br><br>
The formulations include those suitable for oral, parenteral (including subcutaneous, intradermal, intramuscular, intravenous and intraarticular), rectal and topical (including dermal, buccal, sublingual and intraocular) administration although the most suitable route may depend upon for example the condition and disorder of the recipient. The formulations may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form and may be prepared by any of the methods well known in the art of pharmacy. All methods include the step of bringing into association a compound of formula (I) and all salts, esters, amides and physiologically acceptable prodrugs thereof ("active ingredient") with the carrier which constitutes one or more accessory ingredients. In general the formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into association the active ingredient with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both and then, if necessary, shaping the product into the desired formulation.<br>
Formulations of the present invention suitable for oral administration may be presented as discrete units such as capsules, cachets or tablets each containing a predetermined amount of the active ingredient; as a powder or granules; as a solution or a suspension in an â€¢ aqueous liquid or a non-aqueous liquid; or as an oil-in-water liquid emulsion or a water-in-oil liquid emulsion. The active ingredient may also be presented as a bolus, electuary or paste.<br>
A tablet may be made by compression or moulding, optionally with one or more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets may be prepared by compressing in a suitable machine the active ingredient in a free-flowing form such as a powder or granules, optionally mixed with a binder, lubricant, inert diluent, lubricating, surface active or dispersing agent. Moulded tablets may be made by moulding in a suitable machine a mixture of the powdered compound moistened with an inert liquid diluent. The tablets may optionally be coated or scored and may be formulated so as to provide slow or controlled release of the active ingredient therein.<br>
Formulations for parenteral administration include aqueous and non-aqueous sterile injection solutions which may contain anti-oxidants, buffers, bacteriostats and solutes which render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient; and aqueous and non-aqueous sterile suspensions which may include suspending agents and thickening agents. The formulations may be presented in unit-dose or multi-dose containers, for example sealed ampoules and vials, and may be stored in a freeze-dried (lyophilised) condition requiring only the addition of the sterile liquid carrier, for example saline or water-for-injection, immediately prior to use.   Extemporaneous injection solutions and<br>
9<br><br>
suspensions may be prepared from sterile powders, granules and tablets of the kind previously described.<br>
Formulations for rectal administration may be presented as a suppository with the usual carriers such as cocoa butter or polyethylene glycol.<br>
Formulations for topical administration in the mouth, for example buccally or sublingually, include lozenges comprising the active ingredient in a flavoured basis such as sucrose and acacia or tragacanth, and pastilles comprising the active ingredient in a basis such as gelatin and glycerin or sucrose and acacia.<br>
Preferred unit dosage formulations are those containing an effective dose, as hereinbelow recited, or an appropriate fraction thereof, of the active ingredient.<br>
It should be understood that in addition to the ingredients particularly mentioned above, the formulations of this invention may include other agents conventional in the art having regard to the type of formulation in question, for example those suitable for oral administration â€¢ may include flavouring agents.<br>
The compounds of the invention may be administered orally or via injection at a dose of from 0.1 to 1500mg/kg per day, preferably 0.1 to 500mg/kg per day. The dose range for adult humans is generally from 5mg to 35g/day and preferably 5mg to 2g/day. Tablets or other forms of presentation provided in discrete umts may conveniently contain an amount of compound of the invention which is effective at such dosage or as a multiple of the same, for instance, units containing 5mg to 500mg, usually around lOmg to 200mg.<br>
The compounds of the present invention may be administered in combination with one or more other active ingredients. Such other active ingredients suitable for concurrent administration will be clear to a physician, but could be for example an anti-inflammatory agent such as a corticosteroid, e.g.methylprednisolone. Compounds of formula (I) are competitive inhibitors with respect to L-arginine and therefore it may not be appropriate of course to concurrently treat patients with preparations (e.g. total parenteral nutrition) which have a high L-arginine content.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) and all salts, esters, amides and physiologically acceptable prodrugs thereof are preferably administered orally or by injection (intravenous or subcutaneous). The precise amount of compound administered to a patient will be the responsibility of the attendant physician.   However the dose employed will depend on a<br><br>
number of factors, including the age and sex of the patient, the precise disorder being treated, and its severity. Also the route of administration may vary depending on the condition and its severity.<br>
Compounds of formula (I) are novel and accordingly a further aspect of the present invention provides a process for the preparation thereof<br>
Compounds of formula (I) can be prepared:<br><br>
The oxidation may be carried out by methods known in the art, for example by treatment with an oxygen-rich compound, such as 30% hydrogen peroxide and 0.5M ammonium molybdate in perchloric acid.<br><br>
or a protected derivative thereof, with a compound of formula (IV)<br><br>
where L is a leaving group and R1; is    as defined hereinbefore, followed by removal of any protecting groups present, to give a compound of formula (A).<br>
Suitable leaving groups L include -0R5 and -SR5 where R5 is a lower alkyl group, e.g. Ci.4alkyl, preferably methyl or ethyl.<br>
The compound of formula (III) will generally be used in a form in which the amino acid functionality is protected by suitable protecting groups and in this connection reference can be made to T.W. Greene and P.G.M. Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 2nd Edition, John Wiley and Sons Inc., 1991.   The protecting<br><br>
groups can then be removed in conventional manner (loc. cit.) as the final stage of the process to yield the compound of formula (II). For example the amino acid functionality can be protected as the copper salt with deprotection taking place on an ion exchange column which is employed to remove inorganic ions from the reaction mixture.<br>
The compounds of formula (IV) can be used in the form of the free base or as an acid addition salt, e.g. the hydrochloride or hydroiodide salt.<br>
The reaction is generally carried out in a suitable solvent in the presence of base, e.g. an alkali metal hydroxide such as sodium hydroxide, preferably at a pH of about 9 to 11 and generally at a temperature from OoC up to the reflux temperature of the solvent, preferably OoC to 50Â°C. The preferred solvent is water although the reaction may also be carried out in a polar solvent such as a lower alcohol, e.g. methanol or ethanol, or an amide, e.g. dimethylformamide, either alone or in admixture with water, and this may be advantageous in certain circumstances.<br>
The compounds of formula (III) are in general known compounds which can be converted into appropriate protected derivatives in known manner. The imidates and thioimidates of formula (IV) (L is -OR5 and -SR5 respectively) are also in general known compounds and the reaction of such compounds with a primary amine is discussed for example in The Chemistry of Amidines and Imidates, Vol. 2, Eds.

wherein R , is as hereinbefore defined, Q is hydrogen or a carboxyl protecting group and Q' is a protecting group, optionally followed by conversion into another compound of formula (I). Examples of suitable protecting groups include tertbutoxycarbonyl, benzyloxycarbonyl, alkyl, tert-butyl, benzyl etc. Other suitable groups which may be used will be known to one of ordinary skill in the art. When the protecting group is acid labile, for example as in the case of Q being alkyl, the reaction may be carried out by acid hydrolysis, for example by reaction with hydrogen chloride in dioxane, HBr/acetic acid in glacial acetic acid or trifluoroacetic acid in dichloromethane, at a non-extreme temperature of from -5Â°C to lOCC,<br><br>
preferably room temperature, When the protecting group is cleavable by hydrogenolysis, for example benzyloxycarbonyi, the deprotection may be carried out using hydrogen over a catalyst, for example palladium/charcoal.<br><br>
wherein R^ is as hereinbefore defined, Y is O or S and R^^ is Cj.g aJkyI, phenyl-Ci.6-alkyl, or naphthyl-C^.g-alkyl for example benzyl. The reaction may suitably be carried out in a polar solvent, for example a Cj.g alcohol such as methanol or ethanol, at a non-extreme temperature of from -50Â°C to 150Â°C, for example -5Â°C to 50Â°C such as room temperature.<br>
Certain compounds of formula (VU) wherein Y is S are novel, and may be prepared as hereinafter described.<br><br>
wherein 0 and Q' are as hereinbefore defined, and Q" is a suitable protecting group, for example benzyloxycarbonyi, followed by removal of the protecting group Q". The oxidation reaction may be carried out by standard methods known in the art, for example according to the method described in Tet. Lett. (1981) 22 (14), 1287, or by reaction with m-chloroperbenzoic acid to give the sulphoxide product, followed by reaction with "Oxone" if the sulphone product is required. The reaction<br><br>
is suitably carried out in a polar solvent, for example water or a lower alcohol, such as ethanol, or a mixture thereof.<br>
Removal of the protecting group may be effected by standards methods known to one skilled in the art, for example with catalytic transfer hydrogenation conditions using, for example, formic acid in alcohol, such as methanol, in the presence of a suitable catalyst, such as 10% palladium on charcoal.<br>
Compounds of formula (VIII) may be prepared by the reaction of<br><br>
wherei    Q" is   as hereinbefore defined, and R17 is a C1-6 alkyl group or an aryl group, followed by protection of the carboxy and amino groups with protecting groups Q and Q', or vice versa.<br>
Compounds of formula (IX) are not normally isolated and may be prepared by reductive cleavage of a compound of formula (XI):<br><br>
The cleavage may be carried out by methods known in the art, eg by the use of sodium in liquid ammonia at a temperature of from -78oC to OoC, and preferably around -40oC.<br>
Compounds of formula (IX) may also be formed by the treatment of a compound of formula (XII)<br><br><br>
with a suitable inorganic base, eg sodium hydrogen carbonate. The reaction is carried out in a suitable solvent, eg DMF.<br>

Example 3 Biological Activity<br><br>
The inhibition of purified human NO synthases was determined following preparation of human nNOS (Furfine et al. (1993) Biochem. 32, 8512-8517), iNOS (Sherman et al. (1993) Biochem. 32, 11600-11605) and eNOS (Garvey et al. (1994) Arch. Bioch. Biophys., in press) as described. Their activity was monitored by the conversion of [^"^CJ-L-arginlne to citruUine as described by Schmidt et al. ((1991) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88, 365-369) in reaction mixtures (100|al) containing 50mM HEPES pH 7.0, 8^iM tetrahydrobiopterin, ImM NADPH and 0.5|4M [^'^CJ-L-arginine (30,000 cpm) at 30Â°C. The results are shown in Table 1 below.<br><br>
Inhibition of recombinant human iNOS was determined following expression in a baculovirus/insect cell system (Charles et al (1994) In : The Biology of Nitric Oxide 4, Moncada S., Feelisch M., Busse R. and Higgs E.A., eds., Portland Press, London, pp 316-320), assaying the insect cytosol for NO synthase in a microtitre plate assay based on the spectrophotometric assay described previously (Knowles et al (1990) Biochem. Biophys. Res.Commun. 172, 1042-1048). The assay was conducted at 370C in reaction mixtures containing HEPES (lOOmM), DTT (O.lmM), tetrahydrobiopterin (5|ilVI), NADPH (lOOfx M), haemoglobin (S^M), L-arginine (30&gt;xM) and inhibitor (0-300nM), measuring the absorbance change at 405-420nm, and determining the steady-state inhibition between 15 and 30 minutes incubation. The results are shown in Table 2 below.<br>
The inhibition of eNOS and iNOS in situ in rat aortic rings was assessed by measuring the increases in ring tension caused by NO synthase inhibition. For studies of basal tone (reflecting eNOS), rings of thoracic aorta with intact endothelium were prepared as described previously (Rees et al. (1989) Br. J. Pharmacol. 96, 418-424) and cumulative<br><br>
concentration curves obtained for the inhibitors in the presence of a threshold concentration of phenylephrine (EDjo  10 nM), For studies of induced smooth muscle tone (reflecting iNOS), endothelium-denuded rings were exposed to LPS (0.1 |ig/ml from S. typhosa) in the presence of phenylephrine at approximately ED90 for 6 h as described previously (Rees et al.(1990) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Conunun. 173, 541-547). During this time a progressive loss of tone occurred because of iNOS induction. Cumulative concentration curves were then obtjuned for the inhibitors. The results are shown in Table 2 below.<br><br>
The NO synthase efficacy and selectivity data are mean Â± SEM from (n) experiments,<br>
The inhibition of eNOS and iNOS in vivo was assessed by the effects of inhibitors on blood pressure in either normal (eNOS) or endotoxin shocked (iNOS) conscious mice. Female CD-I mice (25-35g) were anaesthetised briefly with isofluorane (2%). Cannula lines were implanted in the femoral vein, tunnelled subcutaneously to exit at the top of the back and connected to a swivel tether system for continuous monitoring of blood pressure and for inhibitor administration respeaively. Following recovery from surgery, animals with mean blood pressures in the normal range (90-110 mm Hg) were used to obtain cumulative concentration curves for inhibitors on blood pressure either without further treatment<br><br>
("normal mice") or 7 h after administration of lipopolysaccharide (12.5 mg/kg of LPS from E coli 026:B6 intravenously over 30 s) to induce shock ("shocked mice"). In normal mice Example 7 had no effect on blood pressure over the dose range 1-lOOOmg/kg. However in shocked mice Example 7 was able to restore fiilly the blood pressure to the normal range.<br>
The effects of Example 7 on endotoxin induced vascular leakage were assessed in rats as described by Laszlo et al ((1994) Brit. J. Pharmacol, iil 1309-1315). Example 7, at doses up to 5mg/kg, when administered concurrently with endotoxin did not cause aggravation of the endotoxin-induced plasma leakage, unlike non-selective inhibitors such as L-NMMA. However, Example 7 did abolish the iNOS-dependent delayed plasma leakage, with an ED50 of 1 mg/kg.<br><br><br>
