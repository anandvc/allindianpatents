				<td>A STATOR FOR A RECIPROCATING MOTOR<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a stator for a reciprocating motor, and<br>
particularly, to a stator for a reciprocating motor of which components can be<br>
fabricated in simple way.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Generally, a motor is a device for changing electric energy into kinetic<br>
energy, and can be classified into a rotary motor changing the electric energy<br>
into rotating movements and a reciprocating motor changing the electric<br>
energy into linear reciprocating movements.<br>
The motor can be used in various fields as a power source. Especially,<br>
the above motor is applied to most electric devices such as refrigerator, air<br>
conditioner, etc.<br>
In the refrigerator and the air conditioner, the motor is used to rotate<br>
a blast fan, however, it can be also used as a power source by being mounted<br>
on a compressor of cooling cycle device included in the refrigerator and the<br>
air conditioner.<br>
Figures 1 and 2 are showing an example of a reciprocating motor<br>
under development by the present applicant. As shown therein, the<br>
reciprocating motor comprises: a bobbin 100 of ringular shape having a coil<br>
110 wound therein; a terminal portion formed on one side of the bobbin 100<br>
for electrically connecting the coil 110 wound in the bobbin 100 to outer<br><br><br>
electric source; an outer core 200 in which a plurality of lamination sheets 210<br>
which are thin plates of U-shape are laminated in radial direction so as to<br>
make a cylindrical shape centering around the bobbin 100; an inner core 300,<br>
in which a plurality of lamination sheets 310 having predetermined area and<br>
length, and having asymmetric upper and lower parts centering around length<br>
direction are laminated in radial direction so as to make a cylinder shape,<br>
inserted into the outer core 200; and an armature 400 inserted between the<br>
outer core 200 and the inner core 300.<br>
The outer core 200 and the inner core 300 including the bobbin 100<br>
construct a stator (S).<br>
On the other hand, the inner core 200 may be located on outer side<br>
of the outer core 200. That is, the bobbin 100 is located on the inner core 300<br>
side, and the bobbin 100 may not be included in the outer core 200.<br>
The lamination sheets 210 constructing the outer core 200 are<br>
laminated so that the bobbin 100 can be inserted into opening recess (H)<br>
formed inside of the lamination sheet 210. In addition, both ends of the<br>
lamination sheet 210 are pole portion 211 forming the poles, and remained<br>
part is path portion 212 on which flux flows.<br>
The lamination sheet 310 constructing the inner core 300 is formed to<br>
have long portion facing the lamination sheet 210 of the outer core 200, short<br>
opposite portion, and coupling recesses 311 with opened ends formed on<br>
both end portions of the lamination sheet.<br>
The armature 400 comprises a magnet holder 410 of cylindrical shape<br>
and a plurality of permanent magnets 420 fixedly coupled on an outer<br><br>
circumferential surface of the magnet holder 410.<br>
In addition, as shown in Figure 3, a laminated body (L) which is made<br>
by laminating the plurality of lamination sheets 310 in radial direction to make<br>
a cylinder shape is fixedly coupled by press-fitting a fixing ring 312 of ringular<br>
shape into a ring coupled recess 311 of ringular shape formed by a concave<br>
recess of the lamination sheets.<br>
Unexplained reference numeral 220 represents a fixing ring of the<br>
outer core.<br>
As shown in Figure 4, when electric current is flowed on the winding<br>
coil 110, a flux is formed around the winding coil 110 by the electric current<br>
flowing on the winding coil 110, and the flux flows along with the outer core<br>
200 and the inner core 300 as forming a closed loop.<br>
The armature 400 is moved toward a center axis direction by an<br>
interaction between the flux caused by the current flowing on the winding coil<br>
110 and the permanent magnet 420 constructing the armature 400.<br>
In addition, when the direction of electric current flowing on the winding<br>
coil 110 is changed, the direction of the flux formed on the outer core 200 and<br>
the inner core 300, and the armature 400 moves toward opposite direction.<br>
When the electric current is supplied as changing its direction, the<br>
armature 400 undergoes linear reciprocating movements between the outer<br>
core 200 and the inner core 300. Accordingly, the armature 400 is to have<br>
linear reciprocating power.<br>
On the other hand, since the outer core 200 and the inner core 300<br>
making the stator (S) are constructed by the laminated body of the plurality<br><br>
of lamination sheets, the loss of flux flowing on the stator can be reduced.<br>
However, according to the above conventional structure, when the<br>
stator (S) is fabricated, the lamination sheet 310 constructing the inner core<br>
300 in the stator (S) is formed as an asymmetric shape for a center line in<br>
length direction, and therefore, the directions of the lamination sheets 310<br>
should be coincided and laminated in laminating the plurality of lamination<br>
sheets 310 as a cylinder shape. Thus, the laminating operation is complex,<br>
and productivity is lowered and it is not suitable for mass production.<br>
TECHNICAL GIST OF THE PRESENT INVENTION<br>
Therefore, an object of the present invention is to provide a stator for<br>
a reciprocating motor of which components can be fabricated in simple way<br>
and assembling property can be improved.<br>
In order to achieve the above objects, there is provided a stator for a<br>
reciprocating motor comprising: a bobbin of insulating material on which a coil<br>
is wound; a terminal portion formed integrally with the bobbin for electrically<br>
connecting the coil to outer electric source; a first lamination core in which a<br>
plurality of lamination sheets formed as thin plates of predetermined shape<br>
are laminated in radial direction along with the bobbin; and a second<br>

predetermined area and length and formed to have symmetric upper and<br>
lower sides for a center line of length direction are laminated in radial direction<br>
to make a cyJinder shape, coupled to the first lamination core to be located<br>
on inner or outer side of the first lamination core.<br>

structure in up-and-down direction for a center line of length direction are laminated<br>
in radial direction to make a cylinder shape, coupled to the first lamination core to be<br>
located on inner or outer side of the first lamination core and formed by forming a<br>
square plate body portion of rectangular shape having a predetermined area and<br>
length, and by forming ring insertion recesses having predetermined width and depth<br>
on both ends of a center in length direction of the square plate body portion.<br>

MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Figures 1 and 2 show an example of a reciprocating motor under development<br>
by the present applicant. As shown therein, the reciprocating motor comprises: a<br>
bobbin 100 of ringular shape having a coil 110 wound therein; a terminal portion<br>
formed on one side of the bobbin 100 for electrically connecting the coil 110 wound<br>
in the bobbin 100 to outer electric source; an outer core 200 in which a plurality of<br>
lamination sheets 210 which are thin plates of U-shape are laminated in radial<br>
direction so as to make a cylindrical shape centering around the bobbin 100; an inner<br>
core 300, in which a plurality of lamination sheets 310 having predetermined area<br>
and length, and having asymmetric upper and lower parts centering around length<br>
direction are laminated in radial direction so as to make a cylinder shape, inserted<br>
into the outer core 200; and an armature 400 inserted between the outer core 200<br>
and the inner core 300.<br>
The outer core 200 and the inner core 300 including the bobbin 100 construct<br>
a stator (S).<br>
On the other hand, the inner core 200 may be located on outer side of the<br>
outer core 200. That is, the bobbin 100 is located on the inner core 300 side, and the<br>
bobbin 100 may not be included in the outer core 200.<br>
The lamination sheets 210 constructing the outer core 200 are laminated so<br>
that the bobbin 100 can be inserted into opening recess (H) formed inside of the<br>
lamination sheet 210. In addition, both ends of the lamination sheet 210 are pole<br>
portion 211 forming the poles, and remaining part is path portion 212 on which flux<br>
flows.<br>
The laminated sheet 310 constructing the inner core 300 is formed to have<br>
long portion facing the lamination sheet 210 of the outer core 200, short opposite<br>
portion, and coupling recesses 311 with opened ends formed on both end portions of<br>
the laminated sheet.<br>
The armature 400 comprises a magnet holder 410 of cylindrical shape and a<br>
plurality of permanent magnets 420 fixedly coupled on an outer circumferential<br>
surface of the magnet holder 410.<br>
In addition, as shown in Figure 3, a laminated body (L) which is made by<br>
laminating the plurality of lamination sheets 310 in radial direction to make a<br>
cylindrical shape is fixedly coupled by press-fitting a fixing ring 312 of ringular shape<br>
into a ring coupled recess 311 of ringular shape formed by a concave recess of the<br>
lamination sheets.<br>
Unexplained reference numeral 220 represents a fixing ring of the outer core.<br>
As shown in Figure 4, when electric current flows on the winding coil 110, a<br>
flux is formed around the winding coil 110 by the electric current flowing on the<br>
winding coil 110, and the flux flows along with the outer core 200 and the inner core<br>
300 as forming a closed loop.<br>
The armature 400 is moved toward a center axis direction by an interaction<br>
between the flux caused by the current flowing on the winding coil 110 and the<br>
permanent magnet 420 constructing the armature 400.<br>
In addition, when the direction of electric current flowing on the winding coil<br>
110 is changed, the direction of the flux formed on the outer core 200 and the inner<br>
core 300, and the armature 400 moves towards opposite direction.<br>
When an electric current is supplied as changing its direction, the armature<br>
400 undergoes linear reciprocating movements between the outer core 200 and the<br>
inner core 300. Accordingly, the armature 400 is to have linear reciprocating power.<br>
On the other hand, since the outer core 200 and the inner core 300 making<br>
the stator (S) are constructed by the laminated body of the plurality of lamination<br>
sheets, the loss of flux flowing on the stator can be reduced.<br>
However, according to the above conventional structure, when the stator (S) is<br>
fabricated, the lamination sheet 310 constructing the inner core 300 in the stator (S)<br>
is formed as an asymmetric shape for a center line in length direction, and therefore,<br>
the directions of the lamination sheets 310 should be coincided and laminated in in<br>
laminating the plurality of lamination sheets 310 as a cylinder shape. Thus, the<br>
laminating operation is complex, and productivity is lowered and it is not suitable for<br>
mass production.<br>
The present invention will now be described with reference to the<br>
accompanying drawings.<br>
Figure 5 shows a reciprocating motor including an embodiment of a<br><br><br>
stator according to the present invention. As shown therein, in the<br>
reciprocating motor, a terminal portion 520 for electricaiiy connecting a coil<br>
510 to outer electric source is formed integrally on an insulating bobbin 500<br>
on which a coil 510 is wound.<br>
In addition, a first lamination core 600 is coupled to outer side of the<br>
bobbin 500, and the first lamination core 600 is a laminated body in which a<br>
plurality of lamination sheets 610 formed as thin plates of U-shape are<br>
laminated in radial direction along with the bobbin 500.<br>
The plurality of lamination sheets 610 constructing the first lamination<br>
core 600 are laminated from one side surface of the terminal portion 520 to<br>
another side surface of the terminal portion 520 so that the bobbin 500 can<br>
be inserted into an opened recess (H) formed in the lamination sheets 610.<br>
In addition, both ends of the lamination sheets 510 become a pole portion<br>
611, and remained part becomes a path portion 612 on which the flux flows.<br>
In addition, a second lamination core 700 is inserted into the first<br>
lamination core 600 with a predetermined gap therebetween.<br>
As shown in Figure 6, the second lamination core 700 comprises a<br>
laminated body L' which is made by laminating a plurality of lamination sheets<br>
710, of which upper and lower sides are formed to have symmetric structure<br>
for center line in length direction, in radial direction to make a cylinder shape,<br>
and a fixing ring 720 for fixing the laminated body L'.<br>
Also, the lamination sheet 710 constructing the second lamination core<br>
700 is formed to have symmetric structure in left-and-right sides based on a<br>
vertical center line for the length direction.<br><br>
The lamination sheet 710 constructing the second lamination core 700<br>
is made by forming a square plate body portion 711 of rectangular shape<br>
having a predetermined area and length, and forming ring insertion recesses<br>
712 having predetermined width and depth on both ends of a center line in<br>
length direction of the square plate body portion 711.<br>
The lamination sheets 710 are laminated in radial direction to make a<br>
cylindrical shape, and after that, the fixing ring 720 of ringular shape is press-<br>
fitted into a recess of ringular shape formed by the ring insertion recesses 712<br>
of the plurality of lamination sheets 710.<br>
Also, as another example of the second lamination core 700, the<br>
lamination sheet 730 may be formed by a square plate body portion 731 of<br>
rectangular shape having a predetermined area and length, ring insertion<br>
recesses 732 formed on both ends of a center in length direction of the<br>
square plate body portion 731 to have a predetermined width and depth, and<br>
a cut recesses 733 formed on upper and lower sides of the ring insertion<br>
recesses 732 respectively to make corners of the square plate body portion<br>
731 be acute angles, as shown in Figure 7. It is desirable that the cut<br>
recesses 733 are formed as triangles.<br>
In addition, an armature 800 is inserted between the first lamination<br>
core 600 and the second lamination core 700. The armature 800 comprises<br>
a magnet holder 810 formed as a cylinder and a plurality of permanent<br>
magnets 820 fixedly coupled on an outer circumferential surface of the<br>
magnet holder 810.<br>
Also, as another embodiment of the present invention, the stator for<br><br>
the reciprocating motor comprises: a bobbin 500 of insulating material on<br>
which a coil 510 is wound; a terminal portion 520 formed integrally with the<br>
bobbin 500 for electrically connecting the coil 510 to outer electric source; a<br>
first lamination core 600 in which a plurality of lamination sheets 510 formed<br>
as thin plates of predetermined shapes are laminated in radial direction along<br>
with the bobbin 500; and a second lamination core 700, in which a plurality<br>
of lamination sheets 710 having predetermined area and length and having<br>
symmetric structure in up-and-down direction for a center line of length<br>
direction are laminated in radial direction to make a cylinder shape, coupled<br>
to the first lamination core 600 to be located on outer side of the first<br>
lamination core 600, as shown in Figure 8.<br>
That is, the first lamination core 600 is inserted into the second<br>
lamination core 700 with a predetermined gap therebetween.<br>
Also, left and right sides of the lamination sheet 710 constructing the<br>
second lamination core 700 is formed to be symmetric based on a vertical<br>
center line for the length direction.<br>
That is, the lamination sheet 710 constructing the second lamination<br>
core 700 is formed by a square plate body portion 711 of rectangular shape<br>
having predetermined area and length, and by ring insertion recesses 712<br>
having a predetermined width and depth formed on both ends of the center<br>
in length direction of the square plate body portion 711.<br>
In addition, the armature 800 is inserted between the first lamination<br>
core 600 and the second lamination core 700.<br>
Hereinafter, operation and effect of the stator for the reciprocating<br><br>
motor will be described as follows.<br>
When the electric current is flowed on the winding coil 510 located in<br>
the bobbin 500, the flux flows along with the first lamination core 600 and the<br>
second lamination core 700 by the current flowing on the winding coil 510 as<br>
forming a closed loop.<br>
The armature is moved toward the center axis by an interaction<br>
between the flux caused by the electric current flowing on the winding coil 510<br>
and the permanent magnets 820 constructing the armature 800.<br>
In addition, when direction of the electric current flowing on the winding<br>
coil 510 is changed, direction of the flux formed on the first lamination core<br>
600 and the second lamination core 700 is changed, and therefore, the<br>
permanent magnets 820 are moved toward opposite direction.<br>
As described above, when the electric current is supplied as changing<br>
its direction, the armature 800 undergoes linear reciprocating movements<br>
between the first lamination core 600 and the second lamination core 700.<br>
On the other hand, since the plurality of lamination sheets 710<br>
constructing the second lamination core 700 are formed to have symmetric<br>
structure in up-and-down, and left-and-right directions on the basis of the<br>
center line in length direction, the lamination sheets 710 do not have<br>
directional property when the sheets are laminated in radial direction, and<br>
therefore, the lamination sheets 710 can be laminated without arranging them<br>
in a predetermined direction.<br>
In addition, in case of the second lamination core 700 in which a<br>
plurality of lamination sheets 730 having cut recesses 733 are laminated<br><br>
shown in Figure 7, the flow of flux which is induced through the pole portion<br>
611 of the first lamination core 611 can be smooth due to the form property.<br>
INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY<br>
As so far described, according to the stator for reciprocating motor of<br>
the present invention, a plurality of lamination sheets constructing the radial<br>
laminated body are constructed so that the upper and lower sides of the<br>
sheets are symmetric for the center line in length direction, and therefore, the<br>
plurality of lamination sheets can be laminated without arranging them toward<br>
a certain direction. Thus, the laminating operation can be made simply and<br>
conveniently to improve the assembling productivity, and to increase mass<br>
productivity.<br><br><br>
