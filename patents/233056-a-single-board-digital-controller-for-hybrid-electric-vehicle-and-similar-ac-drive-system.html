The demand for Electric Vehicles (Evs) and Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEVs) is growing due to environmental and fuel resource concerns in applications requiring frequent start stops. In EVs and HEVs, the propulsion is done by an Electric motor as (ompared to 1C engine in conventional vehicles. The motor in EVs is powered by a battery. In HEVs, the motor is powered by a combination of diesel engine and battery. Further in HEVs the diesel power is converted to Electrical power by an induction generator. Control technology for HEVs such as AV drive controlled for propulsion motor and Generator, efficient battery charger, load manager for power sharing between battery and 1C engine, etc. is essential for realization of a reliable effic snt HEV system.<br>
Generally industrial drive controls are imple nented using DC motor-based systems. These stand alone control system are simple and can be implemented using the low end micro-controllers. AC motor systems are getting widely accepted due to many advantages over DC motor systems. However, control systems in AC systems are more sophisticated. Also distributor control strategy is adopted wherein individual controllers for different applications are connected to a supervisory control station, rather then stand-alone systems. The me dern AC motor control algorithm, which involve high level of mathematical operations require, digital signal processor (DSP) based systems for real time implementation.<br>

Further object of the present invention is to provide a digital controller which has Field Programmable Gate Array (F^'GA) based circuits which integrate large number of discrete components increase reliability and facilitate easy user end modification for the hardware.<br>
Still further object of the present invention is to provide a digital controller which has a provision for PC ink rface for the purpose of efficient software development, debugging and data logging.<br>
Even further object of the present invention is to provide a digital controller with single supply (5V) based analog and digital circuitry thereby simplifying power supply requirements.<br>
Still further object of the present invention is to provide a digital controller with in-built regulated switched m ade power supply for 5V which avoids noise interface to internal circuitry through input power supply from external sources.<br>
Yet further object of the present invention is to provide a single board digital controller for hybrid electric vehicle and similar AC drive systems which incorporates a serial communication network for the data transfer with other control modules of the EV/HEV.<br>
Further objects and advantages of this invention will be more apparent from the ensuing description.<br>
At the outset of the description that follows, it is to be understood that the ensuing description illustrates a particular form of this invention.

BRIEF DESCRITPION OF THE ACCOMPANY! 1G DRAWINGS.<br>
Further objects and advantages of this invention will be more apparent from the ensuing description when read in conjunction with the accompanying drawings and wherein:<br>
Fig. 1 show: a block diagram of the single board controller that shows the features of the present invention.<br>
Fig.2 shows: a general schematic of a Hybrid Electric Vehicle System in which the present invention can be implemented.<br>
DESCRITPION OF THE INVENTION DUTH REFERENCE TO ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
Reference is made to Fig. 1. The single boar digital control hardware implements AC drive control like Propulsion motor control, Generator control and data transfer between various sub modules in HEV. The hardware architecture is broadly classified two parts, areal time controller and a supervisory controller. The DS? (2) based real time<br>
controller implements the Motor control/ Generator control with the corresponding control software from warred into the internal ROM. This circuit is realised using a DSP (2), ADC (3), DAC (6), FPGA (4) based drive control signal generation and Digital I/O intt face (14). The ADC gives drive system variable inputs, DSP implemei its the AC drive control algorithm and FPGA circuitry generates the control signals. Other control data are exchanged from the micro controlled based supervisory circuit using a DPRAM (8). The low speed asynchronous circuit is used for monitoring slow system variable for supervisory control and user interface. This circuit also implements the actual digital data exchange between other system controllers and sensors over a serial communications network. The associated  upervisory software and communication software will be from ware into this circuitry.<br>
This compact digital control PCB is realised Uiing multiplayer PCB with SMD technology. Separate PCB layers for digital power lines gives the reliable performance and EMI compatibility.<br>
The inbuilt Switch Mode Power Supply (SMPS) (1) converts the 15V input to 5V output to suit the 1C supply. The SMP 5 is based on a MOSFET whose gate signal is controlled by a Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) regulator.<br><br>
This on board regulator avoids noise interface to internal circuitry and voltage drops through input power supply from external sources.<br>
The Digital Signal Processor (DSP) (2) based block is the main controller that implements the real time control of the AC motor/generator.<br>
By running the control algorithms in a matt
The circuit has an Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) (3) interface to measure the motor parameters such as staor current. DC capacitor voltage etc. The Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC) (6) interface is rovided to get analog outputs corresponding to test parameters. The gate drive<br>
signals for the IGBTs are generated by an F PGA (4) and a driver (5) combination. A JTAG interface (7) is provided for the DSP for software development and debugging purpose.<br>
The micro controller and associated circuitry does the supervisory functions. A Dual Port Random Access Memory (DPRAM) (8) is used for data exchange between the DSP and the micro controller (9). The micro controller, for supervisory control functions, s :nses analog signals such as temperatures of battery and motor, battery voltage etc. It also senses digital signals such as contactor / relay status, emergency off etc. for immediate and effective control.<br>
The most important function of the micro controller is the serial communication function with various other controllers of the Electric/ Hybrid vehicle. The network is based on RS 485 standard interface. Two serial links are there, one for faster data transf ;r and the other for slower data transfer. The Synchronous RS 485 intei "ace is used for fast data transfer required for the motor and generator control action, the slower bus (Asynchronous RS 485) is used for lesser important parameters such<br>
as temperature of various modules. An RS232C serial communication interface is also provided for the micro controller for program development and debugging.<br>
A general schematic of a Hybrid Electric Vehicle System in which the present invention can be implemented is given in Fig. 2.<br>
The 1C engine (ICE) (1) is coupled to an Induction Generator (IG) (2), which generates a 3-phase AC output. It is rectified by the Generator controller (GC) (3) and its output is available o i the DC bus. The battery is connected across the DC bus and a Battery Charger (BC) (4) is used to recharge the battery. The Propulsion Motor Controller (PMC) (5) is used to recharge the battery. The Propulsion Moto Controller (PMC) inverts the DC voltage into 3-phase AC so as to drive the motor. The motor in turn drives the wheel (7) of the vehicle through a gear arrangement (8). The dashboard (6) acts as the driver interface and data logger.<br><br>
