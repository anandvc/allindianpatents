				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Cefdinir of Formula II is an oral, semi-synthetic cephalosporin antibiotic characterized by having a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity particularly against Staphylococci and Streptococci and a high stability against various P-lactamases. It further exhibits an enhanced activity against gram-positive bacteria as well and is chemically known as 7p-[(Z)-2-(2-amino-4-thiazolyl)-2-hydroxyiminoacetamido]-3-vinyl-3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid.<br>
Several synthetic methods are known in literature for preparation of cefdinir. For example, US Patent 4,559,334 describes a synthetic method starting from benzhydryl 7-amino-3-vinyl-3-cephem-4-carboxylate, which is reacted with 4-bromoacetoacetyl<br><br>
bromide, the resulting product is nitrosated to oxime and cyclized to obtain protected cefdinir. Deprotection yielded cefdinir (Refer Scheme-1). However, this synthetic method suffers from several disadvantages such as use of raw materials which are not available easily, low yielding steps and isolation involving chromatography and lyophilisation. Overall yield reported is 10-11%.<br><br><br>
Spanish Patent ES 2 013 828 describes an alternate route to prepare cefdinir overcoming the difficulties in US Patent 4,559,334 (Refer Scheme-2).<br><br>
(Z)-2-(2-Amino-4-thiazolyl)-2-acetyloxyiminoacetic acid was prepared and converted into corresponding acid chloride hydrochloride (A) via reaction with phosphorus pentachloride and condensed with 7-amino-3-vinyl-3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid in the presence of silylating agent to yield 0-acetyl cefdinir which was deprotected to yield cefdinir.<br>
However, in our hands we observed that the preparation of (Z)-2-(2-amino-4-thiazolyl)-2-acetyloxyiminoacetylchloride hydrochloride was not consistent, possibly due to the nature of side chain and formation of more impurities.   Moreover this<br><br>
reaction resulted in incomplete conversion and formation of anti-isomer was also observed. Further, this process requires very low temperature leading to additional burden on equipment.<br>
US Patent 6,093,814 describes a process wherein tritylated cefdinir is prepared and isolated as 0-trityl cefdinir p-toluenesulfonic acid 2N,N-dimethylacetamide solvate and further converted into cefdinir either by treatment with formic acid or trifluoroacetic acid (Refer Scheme-3). The disadvantages of this process are use of ethers to isolate O-trityl cefdinir p-toluenesulfonic acid 2N,N-dimethylacetamide solvate which greatly enhances danger of fire hazard on a commercial scale and poor solvent recovery.<br><br><br><br>
Detritylation to obtain cefdinir by using perhalogenated acids has been described by Otsuka Chemical Company in EP 1 273 587 Al. However, this process also gave low yields and further handling and disposal of perhalogenated acids poses an industrial hazard.<br>
US application 2004/0034233 Al describes a process for the preparation of anhydride 2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-2-hydroxy compound, and further this compound is treated with halogenating agent to produce acid chloride and this acid chloride is reacted with 7-amino-3-vinyl-3-cephem carboxylic acid to yield cefdinir.<br>
WO 04/016623 Al describes a process for the preparation of cefdinir using cefdinir crystalline salts. The cefdinir crystalline sahs are prepared by reacting 2-(2-amino-4-thiazolyl)-2-[(methylcarbonyloxyimino)imino]acetic acid-mercaptobenzothiazolyl ester with 7-amino-3-vinyl-3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid.<br><br>
In our co-pending patent application No. 441/MAS/03, the cefdinir is prepared by reacting 7-amino-3-vinyl-3-cephem carboxylic acid with 2-mercaptobenzothiazolyl (Z)-2-(2-amino-4-thiazolyl)-2-acetyloxyimino acetate.<br>
Thus, it is evident that the intermediates described in the prior art to prepare cefdinir include an acid chloride, a reactive thiophosphate, a reactive ester and the like. However, these intermediates have some disadvantages such as low yields, expensive input raw materials and handling problem in commercial production. Hence, there is a need to develop new acylating agent which is capable of transferring the 2-aminothiazolyl moiety to 7-amino-3-cephem compound in good yield without producing any side product and without requiring complicated protection / deprotection operations.<br>
OBJECTIVE<br>
The objective of the present invention is to provide a new thioester derivative of thiazolyl acetic acid of the Formula I, which would be better than the earlier reactive derivatives and also suitable for being used in the manufacture of cefdinir.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide a process for the synthesis of thioester derivative of Formula I from thiazolyl acetic acid of Formula III and bis(5-methyl-l,3,4-thiadiazol-2-yl)disulphide of Formula IV.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of cefdinir of Formula (II) from the said novel thioester at 20Â°C temperature.<br><br>

wherein R represents acetyl or trityl.<br>
