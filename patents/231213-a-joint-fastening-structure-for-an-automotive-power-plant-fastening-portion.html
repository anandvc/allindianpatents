In addition, an end face of a flange 9 of a case of the transmission 3 is brought into abutment with end faces (right end faces as viewed in Fig. 1, or portions of Fig. 3 where many dots are provided and many doted lines are caused to intersect with each other) of a flange<br><br>
7 of the cylinder block 4 and a flange 8 of the oil pan 5. A housing flange 11 of a starter motor 10 is brought into abutment with the other end face (a left end face as viewed in Fig. 1) of the flange 7 of the cylinder block 4. Then, a distal externally threaded portion 13 of a bolt 12 passing through a bolt hole 9a in the flange 9 of the transmission 3 and a bolt hole 7a in the flange 7 of the cylinder block 4 from right to left is fastened into an internally threaded hole 14 in the housing flange 11 of the starter motor 10, whereby the transmission 3, the cylinder block 4 and the starter motor 10 are constructed so as to be integrally jointly fastened together with the bolt 12.<br>
Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 1, a bolt 15 passes through an upper portion of the flange 9 of the case of the transmission 3 from right to left to be fastened into a bolt hole 7b in an upper portion of the flange 7 of the cylinder block 4 (refer to Figs 2 and 3) . And, a bolt 16 passes through a bolt hole 8a in a lower portion of the flange 8 of the oil pan 5 (refer to Figs. 2 and 3) from left to right to be fastened into a lower portion of the flange 9 of the case of the transmission 3. Bolts, not shown, other than but similar to the bolt 15 or bolt 16 are fastened along the full circumference of the transmission 3 at required intervals.<br><br>
Moreover, as shown in Fig. 1, the housing flange 11 of the starter motor 10 is brought into abutment with a bottom portion 18 of a main body 17 of the starter motor 10 from left, and as shown in Fig. 2, protruding lugs<br>
20	are.integrally provided on a top portion 19 of the main body 17 of the starter motor 10 diametrically across the center of the main body 17. Then, as shown in Fig. 1, an externally threaded portion 22 of a machine screw<br>
21	passing through the protruding lug 20 from left to right is fastened into an internally threaded portion 23 of the housing flange 11 of the starter motor 10.<br>
Moreover, as shown in Fig. 2, a magnet switch 24 is integrally assembled the main body 17 of the starter motor 10.<br>
In addition, as illustrated in Fig. 1, an air conditioner compressor 25 is integrally mounted on the cylinder block 4 at a position below the lower surface of the cylinder block 4 on a left end side thereof with a mounting member, not shown. And, a cooling water pump 2 6 is integrally mounted on the cylinder block 4 with a mounting member, not shown, at a position above the air conditioner compressor 25 and on this side of the cylinder block 4 as viewed in Fig. 1. Further, an ACG 27, which is an alternate current generator, is integrally mounted on the cylinder block 4 with a mounting member,<br><br>
