				<td>CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION<br>
This application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. 119(e) to U.S. Provisional Patent Application Serial No. 60/469,437, filed May 9, 2003, the teachings of which are incorporated<br>
herein.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
This invention relates to a technique for decoding (extracting) a Linear Time Code (LTC) frame of the type used in connection with film and television and accompanying audio.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
As described in the Society for Motion Picture and Television Engineers (SMPTE) Standard 12M: "Time Code and Control for Television, Audio, and Film", a Linear Time Code (I TO frame serves as a mechanism for communicating digital time-stamp and control code information for use in television, film, and accompanying audio systems operating at 30, 29.97, 25, and 24 frames/second. Each LTC code frame contains 80 bits numbered 0 through 79 that are generated serially beginning with bit 0 for a "forward" time code and bit 79 for a "reverse" time code. Each successive LTC frame begins where the previous frame left off. Each 80-bit LTC frame comprises a 64-bit LTC data word (payload) and a 16-bit static synchronization sequence. Each LTC frame contains a unique time stamp for an associated video or film frame that include four binary-coded-decimal (BCD) fields representing hours, minutes, seconds, and frames. The nominal bit rate for a LTC frame is Fs = 80*Fr, where Fr is the associated nominal video or film frame rate. In addition to the BCD-formatted time stamp, 32 bits remain available within a LTC data word for user-defined purposes. FIGURE 1 depicts an exemplary LTC frame.<br>
The sixteen bits in the synchronization sequence within the LTC frame enable LTC receiving equipment to accurately delineate LTC frames and identify bit positions within each frame. The LTC frame synchronization pattern is unique in that the same bit combination cannot be generated by any combination of valid data values in the remainder of the frame. The twelve centra] bits of the 16-bit synchronization pattern are all logic one. The leading two bits are both zero while the trailing two bits are logic zero followed by logic one. The different leading and trailing bit pair patterns allow an LTC receiver to determine the direction (forward/reverse) of the<br>
LTC frame.<br><br>
The 80-bit NRZ binary data comprising an LTC frame is bi-phase-mark encoded according to the following rules specified in Standard 12M:<br>
•	A transition occurs at each bit symbol boundary regardless of the bit value;<br>
•	A logic one is represented by an additional transition occurring at the bit symbol midpoint;<br>
and<br>
•	A logic zero is represented by having no additional transitions within the bit symbol.<br>
The bi-phase-mark encoded signal has no dc component, is amplitude and polarity insensitive,<br>
and contains significant spectral energy at the bit symbol rate. Therefore, a LTC frame qualifies<br>
as a self-clocking data stream because a Phase Lock Loop (PLL) can lock to this stream and<br>
extract the bit-rate clock. The LTC frame can be recorded on an audio linear tape track.<br>
Heretofore, LTC receivers have used an analog PLL. As discussed above, the LTC Frame utilizes a synchronization technique that makes use of a transition at the bit symbol boundary for both logic zero and logic one binary symbol values, plus an additional mid-symbol transition for logic one bit symbols. Because the frame has high spectral energy at the symbol rate, the PLL can frequency lock its local oscillator to the symbol rate of the bi-phase-mark encoded LTC frame. A "data-slicing" circuit opt" at ing at a multiple of the recovered symbol clock can more than recover the 64payload bits per frame of time code data<br>
Present day LTC recivers that utilize an analog PLL suffer from the disadvantage that the PLL clock recovery circuit  has to work er over a symbol rate of x/30 to 80x the nominal symbol rate of 2400 bits/sec for a 525 line / 60 field video format (80 bits/frame x 30 frames/sec). Designing a voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) that works over this wide an input reference range often proves difficult. Moreover, analog circuitry typically requires calibration to achieve repeatable results.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Briefly, in accordance with the present principles, there is provided a method for receiving a Linear Time Code (LTC) frame. The method commences upon detecting a valid synchronization sequence within an incoming LTC frame while measuring a predetermined symbol interval relative to a reference clock. Next the LTC frame direction is determined. Using measured symbol interval, payload information is then extracted from the LTC frame and that payload information is transferred for storage in a fixed order.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
FIGURE 2 depicts a block schematic diagram of a LTC receiver 10 in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present principles for decoding (extracting) payload information from an LTC frame of the type depicted in FIG. 1. The receiver 10 of FIG. 2 includes a state machine 12 that has fifty-five states. The states of the state machine 12, described hereinafter with respect to the state diagrams of FIGS. 3-5, effect LTC frame payioad decoding (extraction) by the steps of:<br>
1.	Delecting a valid bi-phase-mark sync sequence while simultaneously measuring the<br>
current frame's half-symbol interval<br>
2.	Detecting the bi-phase-mark stream direction: forward or reverse;.and<br>
3.	Extracting the 64 bits of data from the bi-phase-mark encoded stream for storage in the<br>
correct bit order, regardless of stream direction.<br>
To facilitate LTC frame payload extraction, the LTC receiver 10 includes three counters 14, 16, and 18; all clocked by a 27 MHz. clock 20 that also clocks the state machine 12. Counter 14 bears the designation "Half-Symbol Duration counter" because the counter counts the number of clock periods of the 27 MHz reference clock 20 that occur within the duration of a bi-phase-mark half-symbol interval. The Half Symbol Duration Counter 14 commences counting upon receipt of a<br>
signal "IntervalCounterEnableGate" from the state machine 12 and the counter becomes reset in responsive to a reset signal "IntervalCounterEnableResetPulse" from the state machine.<br>
To better understand how the count of the Half-Symbol Duration counter 14 provides a measure of the half-symbol interval, refer to the format of the LTC frame depicted in FIG. 1. As<br><br>
shown, the bits of the 16-bit sync word are bi-phase mark encoded. By virtue of such bi-phase mark encoding, the one's bits undergo a change in phase at twice the symbol rate. Thus, by counting the number of 27MHz clock periods between alternations of the one's bit in the sync word, the Half-Symbol Duration counter 14 provides a count corresponding to half of the symbol rate to facilitate decoding (extraction) of the data contained in the 64-bit payload of the LTC frame of FIG. 1.<br>
The Half-Symbol Duration Counter 14 of FIG. 2 supplies its count to the state machine 12 and to a register 22. The register 22, designated as the "Interval Count Reference Register", stores the count of the counter 14 for input at the state machine 12 following the receipt of a state machine signal "PreviousCountLoadPulse." In this way, the Interval Count Reference Register 22 provides a previous interval count to the state machine 12 during the sync detection state of the decoding (extraction) process. The previous interval count serves as a timing reference for parsing the 64-bit payload of the LTC frame of FIG. 1. The number of 27 MHz. Clock periods occurring within a half-symbol bi-phase mark for a specified range of frame rates appears in the Table I below, where X is a nominal LTC frame rate.<br>
TABLE I<br>
(Table Removed)<br><br><br><br>
The minimum required count of clock periods is seventy while the maximum count is<br><br>
210,947. The Half-Symbol Duration counter 14 has an eighteen-bit width (2    =266,144) to<br>
accommodate X/30 LTC stream rates. The 27 MHz reference clock 20 provides sufficient resolution for the very short bit symbol periods encountered during 80*X stream rates.<br>
The counter 16 bears the designation "Sync Counter" because the counter counts the number of bits decoded from the 16-bit synch field of the LTC frame of FIG. 1. The Sync Counter 16 commences counting responsive to the receipt of "SyncCounterlncrementPulse" from the state machine 12 and becomes reset upon receipt of a pulse, designated as "SyncCounterResetPulse". The Sync Counter 16, which has a five-bit width, serves to detect the twenty-four alternating logic one's and zero's of half symbol duration in the synch field of the LTC frame. This sequence constitutes the bi-phase-mark encoded equivalence of the twelve consecutive logic ones comprising the sync field within the 80-bit NRZ (non-return to zero) binary data frame comprising the LTC frame.<br>
Counter 18 bears the designation "Data Symbol Counter" because it serves to count the number of decoded (extract-, h data word.- shifted GUI from the state machine 12 into a sixty-four-bit shift register 24. The Data Symbol Counter 18 commences counting in response to a signal "SymbolCounterlncrementPulse" received from the state machine 12. The direction at which the shift register 24 shifts out the data words to a .sixty-four-bit buffer 26 depends on the state of a signal "Stream Direction" received by the shift register from the stale machine 12. The bit buffer 26 serves to output the bits received from the shift register 24 in response to the state of a signal "ValidFrameLoadPulse" received from the state machine 12. As its name implies, the ValidFrameLoadPulse signal serves to trigger the shift register 26 upon a determination by the state machine 12 that valid frame information has been output to the shift register 24.<br>
In addition to the various signals described thus far, the state machine also generates several other signals. These signals include: (a) a "LTC Stream direction Flag" that designates the direction of the LTC frame, (b) a "Valid Sync Flag" that designate whether the synchronization of the LTC frame is valid, and (c) a "Transfer OK signal" that reflects whether a valid transfer of the LTC data has occurred.<br>
Proper operation of the state machine 12 depends on its ability to change states in synchronism with the bi-phase mark transitions within an incoming LTC frame. Hence, filtering of an incoming LTC frame becomes important. To that end, the LTC receiver 10 of FIG. 2 includes a glitch filter 30 at its input to filter out bi-phase mark transitions of a duration less that the minimum half symbol duration associated with the X/30 stream rate. Assuming a reference :lock frequency of 27 MHz, the minimum half-symbol duration is seventy.<br><br>
FIGURE 3 graphically depicts the first sixteen states of the state machine 12 associated with sync detection and symbol interval measurement. As discussed in greater detail below, sixteen state transitions are required to detect the sync pattern and measure the bi-phase-mark half-symbol duration of the twenty-four alternating 0-1 sync patterns. To detect the sync sequence, the interval count, in 27 MHz clock periods, of the period between bi-phase-mark transitions via the half-symbol interval counter is continually captured. If the current interval count is within +1-25% of the previous interval count, the Sync Counter 16 is incremented, otherwise the Sync Counter is reset to zero. When the count of the Sync Counter 16 reaches twenty-four, the "valid sync" flag is set and the state machine 12 transitions to the bit stream direction detection sequence of FIG. 4. The previous interval count stored in the Interval Count Reference Register 22 now becomes the reference for bi-phase-mark half-symbol duration (half of a NRZ logic 1) for the rest of the frame. An interval count within +1-25% of twice this count indicates a bi-phase-mark full-symbol duration (a NRZ logic 0).<br>
The Sync detection and Symbol Interval detection process upon execution of State 0 (the reset state, which occurs initial power up. Upon entering State 0, the counters 12, 14, and 16 become reset, as do the sync flag and the LTC Stream direction Flag. The state machine 12 of FIG. 2 remains at State 0 as long as the bi-phase mark symbol value remains zero. Upon a change of the bi-phase mark symbol value to a logic 1 level, the state machine 12 enters State 1 of FIG. 3 and triggers the Half Symbol Duration counter 14 of FIG. 2 to start counting. The Half Symbol Duration counter 14 continues to count until the bi-phase mark symbol value returns to zero at which time the state machine 12 enters State 2, whereupon the Half Symbol Duration counter 14 stops counting, and its current count is stored. Following State 2, State 3 becomes active, whereupon the Half Symbol Duration counter 14 becomes reset.<br>
State 4 becomes active following State 3 and the Half Symbol Duration counter 14 commences counting again. The state machine 12 remains in State 4 so long as the bi-phase mark symbol value remains zero. When the bi-phase mark symbol value changes to a logic one, the state machine 12 enters State 5 of FIG. 3, whereupon, the Half Symbol Duration Counter 14 stops counting. Following State 5, the state machine 12 enters one of several different states depending on the value of the Current Interval Count (CIC) of the Half Symbol Duration Counter 14 and its relation to the Previous Interval Count (PIC) of the Interval Count Reference Register 22. If the CIC exceeds a maximum count (max_count), representing a condition where the actual LTC symbol rate exceeds the maximum allowable LTC bit symbol rate, or the CIC is less than a minimum count (min_count), representing a condition where the actual LTC bit symbol rate lies<br><br>
below a minimum allowable LTC symbol rate, then the state machine 12 returns to State 0 after State 5. In this way, the state machine 12 re-initiates the sync detection and symbol interval measurement process after encountering a symbol rate that is too high or too low.<br>
Upon finding that the condition min_ count 
Should state machine 12 find the sync count of the Sync Counter 16 less than twenty-three during State 7, indicating lack of detection of a complete sync pattern, State 8 becomes active, whereupon the Half Symbol Duration Counter 14 commences counting. State 8 remains active so long as the bi-phase mark symbol value remains at a logic one. Once the bi-phase mark symbol value transitions to a logic zero level, the state machine 12 of FIG. 2 enters State 11 of FIG. 3, whereupon the Half Symbol Duration Counter 14 stops counting. From State 11, the state machine 12 enters State 12 of FIG. 3 upon finding the condition 75PIC 
If, during State 11 of FIG. 3, the condition .75PIC 
<br>
does not equal or exceed 23, State 14 becomes active during which the Half Symbol Duration Counter 14 commences counting. State 14 remains active until the bi-phase mark symbol value becomes 1.<br>
As discussed above, the state machine 12 enters State 6 following State 5 finding both conditions min_ count 
FIGURE 4 depicts the state diagram illustrating the states associated with LTC frame bit stream detection. Two separate 10-state sequences exist for stream direction determination. Which 10-state sequence is chosen depends on the polarity of the sync field detected during the sync detection state sequence described previously with respect to FIG. 3. The stream direction detection sequence searches for the bi-phase-mark encoded equivalence of the "01" forward or "00" reverse NRZ bit fields. When the direction is determined, the direction flag is asserted to cither Forward or Reverse, and the state machine transitions to the data decoding (extraction) sequence described hereinafter with respect to FIG. 5.<br>
Referring to FIG. 4, the first of the two ten-sequence states associated with bit stream direction detection commences with State 17 becoming active following State 7 of FIG. 3, whereupon, the Half Symbol Duration Counter 14 of FIG. 2 commences counting, and the sync flag becomes set. When active, this flag indicates a valid LTC sync pattern has been detected. State 17 remains active so long as the bi-phase mark symbol value remains at a logic one level. Upon a transition of the bi-phase mark symbol value to a logic zero level, State 18 becomes active and the Half Symbol Duration Counter 14 stops counting. Thereafter, State 19 becomes active when the condition 1.75 PIC 
<br><br>
State 20 becomes active following State 19, and the Half Symbol Duration Counter 14 commences counting. State 20 remains active until so long as the bi-phase mark symbol value remains at a logic zero. Once the bi-phase mark symbol value transitions to a logic one level, the state machine 12 enters State 21. During State 21, the Half Symbol Duration Counter 14 stops<br><br>
ounting /    After state 21, the state machine 12 of Fig .2 enter states .22 when the  conditionJ  <br>
PIC 
As described, State 23 becomes active following State 21 when the condition .75 PIC 
Referring to FIG. 4, the state machine 12 enters State 27 following State 13 of FIG. 3 upon determining that the sync count of the Sync Counter 16 equals or exceeds twenty-three. Upon entering State 27, the state machine 12 of FIG. 2 starts the Half Symbol Duration Counter 14 and sets the sync flag to signify a valid sync condition. State 27 remains active as long as the bi-phase mark symbol value remains at a logic zero level. Once the bi-phase mark symbol value transitions to a logic 1 level, State 28 becomes active and the Half Symbol Duration Counter 14 slops counting. State 29 becomes active after State 28 if the condition 1.75 PIC 
<br>
State 30 becomes active after State 29, whereupon the Half Symbol Duration Counter 14 commences counting. State 30 remains active so long as the bi-phase mark symbol value remains at a logic one level. Once the bi-phase mark symbol value transitions to a logic zero level, State 31 becomes active, whereupon the Half Symbol Duration Counter 14 stops counting. From State<br>

is true; or enters State 33 when the condition .75 PIC 
Upon finding the condition 75 PIC 
FIGURE 5 depicts the nineteen states of the state machine 12 associated with decoding the 64 bits in the payload of the LTC frame of FIG. 1. The 19-state data decoding sequence uses the bi-phase-mark half-symbol interval count stored in the Interval Count Reference Register 22 as the timing reference for decoding the 64-bit data payload in the LTC frame of FIG. 1. As will become better understood from a description of the individual states of the decoding sequence, two consecutive transitions with durations within +/-25% of the reference half-symbol count are decoded as a NRZ logic 1, while a transition with a duration within +/-25% of twice the reference count is decoded as a NRZ logic 0. Every sequential decode loads the equivalent NRZ bit into the Shift Register 24 of FIG. 2 in the direction indicated by the direction flag, and increments the Data Symbol Counter 18.  When the count of the Data Symbol Counter reaches sixty-four, the<br><br>
contents of the shift register 24 are transferred to the 64-bit buffer register 26 and the Transfer OK flag is asserted. This register is read while the next frame undergoes decoding.<br>
Referring to FIG. 5, the decoding sequence for a reverse-true or forward-true bi-phase mark stream commences upon entry of State 37 following either of States 22 or 36 of FIG. 4. As described hereinafter, the decoding sequence commences for a reverse-complement or forward-complement bi-phase mark stream upon entry of State 44 of FIG. 5 following one of States 26 or 32 of FIG. 4. Upon entering State 37, the state machine 12 causes the Half Symbol Duration Counter 14 to commence counting. State 37 remains active for so long as the bi-phase mark symbol value remains a logic one level. Upon a transition of the bi-phase mark symbol value to a logic zero, State 38 becomes active, whereupon the Half Symbol Duration Counter 14 stops counting. From State 38, the state machine 12 of FIG. 2 enters State 51 when the condition 1.75 PIC 
State 40 remains active so long as the bi-phase mark symbol value remains a logic zero. Upon a transition of the bi-phase mark symbol value to a logic one value, State 41 becomes active, and the Half Symbol Duration Counter 14 stops counting. Following State 41, State 42 becomes active if the condition .75 PIC 
<br>
Bit Buffer Register 26 prior to proceeding to State 0. After transitioning to State 0, the State Machine 12 is ready to start decoding a subsequent LTC frame. Otherwise, should the symbol_count not exceed sixty-four, then following State 43, State 37 once again becomes active to commence the process of decoding a successive symbol value.<br>
Following states 38 state 51 becomes active when the condition 1.75 PIC 
PIC is true; rather entering state 39 when .75 PIC 
State 44 of FIG. 5 also becomes active following States 26 and 32 of FIG. 4. Upon entering State 44, the state machine 12 causes the Half Symbol Duration Counter 14 to commence counting. State 44 remains active for so long as the bi-phase mark symbol value remains a logic zero level. Upon a transition of the bi-phase mark symbol value to a logic one, State 45 becomes active, whereupon the Half Symbol Duration Counter 14 stops counting. From State 45, the state machine 12 of FIG. 2 enters State 53 when the condition 1.75 PIC 
<br>
logic one value. This value is simultaneously shifted into the 64-Bit Shift Register 24 in a direction (MSB first or LSB first) dictated by the value of the Direction Flag ("FORWARD" or "REVERSE"). Following State 49, State 50 becomes active, whereupon a comparison occurs Detween the symbol_count, and the value sixty-four. If the symbol count equals or exceeds sixty-four, then LTC frame decoding has been successful and State 55 becomes active, whereupon the :ontents of the 64-Bit Shift Register 24 are transferred to the 64-Bit Buffer Register 26, prior to proceeding to State 0 of FIG. 2. After transitioning to State 0, the State Machine 12 is ready to start decoding a subsequent LTC frame. Otherwise, should the symbol_count not exceed sixty-four, then following State 50, State 44 once again becomes active to commence the process of Jecoding a successive symbol value.<br>
Following State 45, State 53 becomes active when the condition 1.75 PIC 
The LTC receiver 10 is capable of decoding LTC bi-phase-mark encoded data streams ver any combination of the following operating conditions:<br>
•	Forward and reverse stream directions<br>
•	Bit symbol rates from X/30 to 80*X, where X is the nominal LTC frame rate<br>
•	True and complement data polarity<br>
everse data streams can be generated when an audio linear tape track (not shown) storing the TC stream is operated in the reverse direction. Bit symbol rates other than nominal can be nerated when the audio linear tape track storing the LTC stream is operating in jog or shuttle de. The nominal bit symbol rates for various video or film frame rates is given by Fs = 80*Fr, lere Fr is the video/film frame rate.<br><br>
A summary of nominal, minimum, and maximum bit symbol rates appear in Table II below.<br>
TABLE II<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Because of the nature of the bi-phase-mark modulation method, the polarity of the transition of the first bit of the synchronization word may differ from LTC frame to LTC frame depending on the number of logical zeros in the data. The LTC receiver 10 thus has the capability of decoding streams of either true or complement polarity.<br>
The foregoing decribes a LTC frame reciver 10 having completly digital implementation capable of operating with a high-speed clock that can be asynchronous to the LTC bit symbol rate.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
