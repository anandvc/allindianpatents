				<td>DEVICE  FOR PRODUCTION  OF HYDROGEN  FROM  EFFLUENTS OF INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a device for production of hydrogen from effluents of internal combustion engines. More particularly the present invention relates to generation of hydrogen for fuel cells and hydrogen based internal combustion engines by using unburnt/partially burned fuel and other organic compounds emitted from the exhaust of an internal combustion engine. Background of the invention<br>
Internal combustion engines burn fossil fuels such as petrol, diesel, kerosene, natural gas etc., and generate energy, which is used for transportation, pumping of liquids and for generating electricity. Fossil fuels are basically hydrocarbons, which contain predominantly carbon and hydrogen atoms. Burning of these fuels in internal combustion engines produces energy depending on efficiency of the engine, and a large quantity of un-burnt/partially burned fuel and other pollutants. 70% of air pollution in urban areas is due to burning of fossil fuels in internal combustion engines. Some of these pollutants are harmful and some are harmless. Harmful pollutants are CO, NOx, SOx, hydrocarbons, and volatile organic compounds. Some of the harmless pollutants are hydrogen, water vapor, oxygen and nitrogen. There are at least 200 different hydrocarbons that an internal combustion engine generates and emits at its exhaust. These include Methane (CH4), Acetylene (C2H2), Ethylene (C2H4), Ethane (C2H6), Propane (C3H6), Benzene (C6H6), Toluene (C7H8) etc., It also generates other organic compounds such as Aldehyde (CH3CHO), Ammonia (NH3), Hydrogen Sulfide (H2S), Formaldehyde (HCHO), Acetaldehyde (CH3CHO), Ethyl alcohol (C2H5OH), Methyl alcohol (CH3OH), Acetone (CH3COCH3), Formic acid (HCOOH), Nitric acid (HNO3) etc. These these compounds are rich sources of hydrogen. Internal combustion engine emits 1-2% of hydrogen showing that the engine is capable of hydrogen generation.<br>
An internal combustion engine does not use any hydrogen or carbon. It only burns higher order fuels (hexane (C6H14), heptane (C7H16), octane (C8H18) etc.,), breaks them and converts them into lower order hydrocarbons. All the quantity of hydrogen present in the fuel before burning will be there in the exhaust of the engine. In addition to that more hydrogen will be added in the engine from the water vapor from air, since the engine uses air for burning. Moreover, efficiency of the internal<br><br>
combustion engine is only in the range of 24-30%. Thus, 70-76% of the energy from the fossil fuels is wasted and a large portion thereof -about 36%, comes out as unburnt or partially burned fuel from the exhaust. There will be therefore plenty of hydrogen in the exhaust of the internal combustion engine. Therefore, it is possible to generate a large quantity of hydrogen using internal combustion engine. Exhaust gas of internal combustion engines can be used to generate hydrogen gas for fuel cells as well as for running another internal combustion engine using hydrogen rich gas as fuel.<br>
There are many attempts reported to generate hydrogen by various techniques such as steam reforming, CO reforming, water gas shift reaction, biomass reforming, photo biological water splitting etc. However, no attempt has been made to generate hydrogen from the exhaust gas of an internal combustion engine.<br>
US Patent 6,659,049 discloses generation of hydrogen using a Venturi device coupled with exhaust stream of an internal combustion engine which generates water. Using this water and an electrolyzer, hydrogen is generated and used in the internal combustion engine to reduce the emission of pollutants. The drawbacks are the method is useful for the reduction of pollutants emission but it does not make use of large quantity of hydrocarbons the engine emits and moreover it does not stop emission of all the pollutants. The hydrogen so generated will not be of any use for fuel cells.<br>
US Patent 6,623,719 teaches a hydrogen generation system from hydrocarbons such as natural gas, propane, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), alcohols, naphtha and other hydrocarbon fuels by using steam reforming technique. The drawbacks are the method uses valuable chemicals (fuels) that have many use and does not use the waste hydrocarbons generated in the internal combustion engine.<br>
US Patent 6,506,510 relates to hydrogen generation using methane-cracking reaction. The drawbacks are it uses the raw methane gas for hydrogen production and does not use the waste hydrocarbons generated in the internal combustion engine.<br>
US Patent 6,172,574 teaches generation of hydrogen by steam reforming of methanol and carbon monoxide. The drawbacks are it uses raw methanol for hydrogen production and does not use waste hydrocarbons generated in the internal combustion engine.<br>
US Patent 4,104,191 teaches generation of hydrogen from flue gases by mixing it with fuel and converting in the presence of oxidant. The drawbacks are it<br><br>
requires fuel and it does not make use of waste hydrocarbon generated by the internal combustion engine.<br>
There are no reports or patents, which use waste hydrocarbons or hydrogen rich compounds generated by internal combustion engines for generation of hydrogen for fuel cells or for running another internal combustion engine with hydrogen as the fuel. The compounds generated by the internal combustion engine, which are rich in hydrogen, can be used for the generation of hydrogen. Objects of the invention<br>
The main object of the invention is to provide a novel device for production of hydrogen from effluents of internal combustion engines, which obviates the drawbacks as detailed in the prior art.<br>
Another object of the invention is to use un-burnt/partially burned fuel/hydrocarbons and other hydrogen rich compounds emitted by internal combustion engines for production of hydrogen.<br>
Another object of the invention is to eliminate all pollutants emitted by internal combustion engines by reforming them into useful and harmless chemicals.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide hydrogen to the internal combustion engine to assist in the combustion process and reduce emission of pollutants.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide pure hydrogen, which can be used for fuel cells, and hydrogen rich gas, which can be used for running another internal combustion engine with hydrogen rich gas as fuel. Brief description of the accompanying drawing<br>

The present invention provides a device for production of hydrogen from effluents of internal combustion engine. The device is described with reference to the figure accompanying this specification. The internal combustion engine (1) has a steam generator (2) built around and in close thermal contact therewith. The exhaust of the internal combustion engine (1) and steam generator (2) are connected to a reformer (3) provided with a plurality of slots, different catalysts being provided in each slot. The reformer (3) is provided with a first outlet and a second outlet. The first outlet is connected to a hydrogen separation membrane (4) and the second outlet (5) emits hydrogen rich fuel. The hydrogen separation membrane (4) is provided with a first outlet and a second outlet. The first outlet (6) is connected can be connected to the same or another internal combustion engine (1) and the second outlet (7) emits pure hydrogen which can be used for fuel cells.<br>
The steam generator (2) is constructed in close thermal contact with the internal combustion engine (1) to make use of the heat generated by the internal combustion engine (1) for the production of steam. The steam generator (2) and the exhaust of the internal combustion engine (1) are connected to a reformer (3) to generate hydrogen and to decompose other pollutants.<br>
The reformer (3) has several slots, each slot is filled with different catalytic material dependant on the constituents of the exhaust gas from the internal combustion engine. The reformer results in the decomposition of hydrocarbons, hydrogen rich organic compounds and other compounds. The reformer (3) has two outlets, one outlet (5) gives hydrogen rich fuel, which can be used for running another internal combustion engine with hydrogen rich gas as the fuel. The reformer is also<br><br>
connected to a hydrogen separation membrane (4), which gives pure hydrogen. The outlet (6) of hydrogen separation membrane (4) is connected to the same or another internal combustion engine (1), to provide pure hydrogen to thereto in order to assist in the combustion process and reduce the emission of pollutants.<br>
The second outlet (7) of the hydrogen separation membrane (4) which gives pure hydrogen can be connected to a fuel cell.<br>
An internal combustion engine burns fossil fuels like petrol, diesel, kerosene, natural gas etc., and generates energy depending on the fuel efficiency of the engine. Most internal combustion engines available today have fuel efficiency in the range of 24-30%. Thus, the remaining 70-76% of fuel is not used for energy conversion. A large portion of such fuel-about 36%, is emitted from the exhaust of internal combustion engines as un-burnt/partially burned fuel or hydrocarbons. The exhaust of the engine also emits many organic compounds, nitrous oxides, sulfur oxides, acids, particulate matter, water vapor, hydrogen, oxygen and the like. Most of such compounds emitted in the exhaust are rich sources of hydrogen. Thus, the exhaust gases can be reformed to get hydrogen and hydrogen rich gases. Steam reforming is the well-known chemical process to produce hydrogen from hydrocarbons. The following reaction illustrates steam reforming.<br>
CnHm+nH2O→(n+m/2) H2+nCO<br>
The steam is produced in a steam generator built around the internal combustion engine and thermally in close contact with the engine so that it derives thermal energy from the engine for steam production. Approximately 30% of the energy produced by the internal combustion engine is wasted as heat energy. This energy is used for steam production. The steam and the exhaust of the internal combustion engine are mixed in the reformer, which has many slots; each slot is filled with different catalysts.<br>
The above-mentioned steam reforming reaction takes place in the reformer. Some of the other reactions, which take place in the reformer are:<br>
Partial oxidation: CnHm+n/2O2→m/2 H2+nCO<br>
Auto thermal reforming: CnHm+(n-a) H2O+a/2 02 →(n-a+m/2) H2+nCO<br>
Water gas shift reaction: H2O+CO→H2+CO2<br>
All these reactions produce hydrogen.<br><br>
Other organic compounds can also be catalytically converted to get hydrogen for example:<br>
Methanol can be decomposed using Cu, Zn-Cu-cement catalyst to get: CH3OH→CO+2H2 CO+H2O-&gt;CO2+H2<br>
Similarly ethanol can be decomposed over Pd-catalyst to give: C2H5OH→CH4+CO+H2 CO+H2O→CO2+H2<br>
Catalysts are also available to reduce NO or NO2 to get: NO (or NO2)+CO→l/2 N2+CO2<br>
It is also possible to convert NO or N02 to HNO3 (Nitric acid) using the reactions: NO+O→NO2 H2O+O→2OH OH+NO2→HNO3<br>
Similarly SO2 and SO3 can be converted to H2SO3 and H2SO4 using the reactions: S02+H2O→H2SO3 SO2+O→SO3 SO3+H2O→H2SO4<br>
The exhaust gases are hot enough so heating of these gases is not required.<br>
The reformer therefore produces hydrogen rich gases, which can be used to run another internal combustion engine. Hydrogen separation membrane can be used to extract pure hydrogen for fuel cells and a part of it can be fed back to the internal combustion engine because it is a well-known fact that the hydrogen assists the combustion process and increases the efficiency of the engine and reduces the pollutants emission.<br>
The present invention resides in a novel apparatus to use waste exhaust gas of internal combustion engines for production of hydrogen and hydrogen rich gas thereby increasing the efficiency of the engine and using the fuel completely for energy generation. Hydrogen generation by using hydrocarbons, and other compounds, which are well known and well documented in the literature, can be used in this process as well.<br><br>
The hydrogen generation method works in the following way. The internal combustion engine (1) burns fuel from fuel tank (8) and generates energy. The waste thermal energy of the internal combustion engine (1) is used to produce steam using steam generator (2) that boils water from the water tank (9) and generates steam. The exhaust gas from the internal combustion engine (1) and steam from steam generator (2) are mixed in the reformer (3). The steam reforming, partial oxidation, auto thermal, water shift, decomposition, and many such reactions take place in the reformer and produce gases like H2, N2, CO2, O2 and the like. Hydrogen rich gases are taken out from the outlet valve (5) and can be mixed with air and used for running another internal combustion engine. The pure hydrogen can be obtained by using hydrogen separation membrane (4). The outlet (7) gives pure hydrogen. The outlet (6) is used to supply a small percentage of hydrogen to the internal combustion engine (1), which helps in the combustion process and reduces the emission of pollutants.<br>
Thus the invention provides a novel method and device for production of hydrogen from exhaust gases of an internal combustion engine.<br>
An internal combustion engine is a chemical rector where the following<br>
reaction occurs:<br>
Fuel + Air	&gt;Energy + Exhaust gas<br>
Since the chemical reaction has to be balanced, all the hydrogen present in the mixture of fuel and air must be present in the exhaust gas. This shows that exhaust gas of an internal combustion engine is an important source of hydrogen required for fuel cell<br>
development. The maximum conversion efficiency of existing internal combustion engines is only about 30%. The remaining 70% energy is wasted. About 30% of energy is wasted as heat energy. In the present invention, this energy is used for the reformer.<br>
While known hydrogen generation systems use raw fuel like methane, CNG, LPG, methanol and the like, the present invention uses only waste exhaust gas and waste heat generated by the internal combustion engine and is therefore economical and efficient.<br>
The main advantages of the present invention are: 1)  It generates hydrogen and hydrogen rich gas from the waste exhaust gas of the internal combustion engine.<br><br>
2)	It increases the efficiency of the internal combustion engine and decreases the emission of pollutants.<br>
3)	The hydrogen gas is useful for fuel cells and the hydrogen rich gas is useful for running another internal combustion engine<br>
4)	It stops the emission of pollutants from the internal combustion engine and converts them into useful and harmless gases.<br>
5)	It does not require any extra energy or power supply for the production of hydrogen.<br><br><br><br>
