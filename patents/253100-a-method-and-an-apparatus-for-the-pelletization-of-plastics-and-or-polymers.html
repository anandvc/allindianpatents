				<td>A method and an apparatus for the pelletization of plastics and/or polymers<br>
The present invention relates to a method for the pelletization of plastics and/or<br>
polymers, wherein a melt coming from a melt generator is supplied via a diverter<br>
valve having different operating positions to a plurality of pelletizing heads through<br>
which the melt is pelletized. The invention furthermore relates to a pelletizing<br>
apparatus for the pelletization of plastics and/or polymers having a diverter valve<br>
which has at least one melt generator connection, at least two pelletizer<br>
connections as well as a switching gate for selectively connecting the melt<br>
generator connection to at least one of the pelletizer connections, with a respective<br>
pelletizing head being connected to the at least two pelletizer connections and a<br>
melt generator having a variable melt volume flow being connected to the melt<br>
generator connection. Finally, the invention also relates to a diverter valve for such<br>
a pelletizing apparatus having a melt generator connection, a pelletizer connection<br>
as well as a melt passage for the connection of the melt generator connection to the<br>
pelletizer connection.<br>
As a rule, diverter valves via which the pelletizer is connected to the melt generator<br>
are used for the start-up of pelletizer devices. This in particular applies to complex<br><br>
production processes whose start-up procedure is difficult as well as to applications<br>
in which uniform pellets should be generated as rapidly as possible. Diverter valves<br>
of this type are described, for example, in DE 102 34 228 A1; DE 38 15 897 C2 or<br>
EP 0 698 461 B1. These diverter valves comprise, in the melt passage which<br>
connects the inlet opening of the valve at the melt generator connection to the<br>
outlet opening at the pelletizer connection, a diverter gate which interconnects the<br>
connection of the melt generator connection to the pelletizer connection in the<br>
production position, whereas it keeps the melt flow away from the outlet opening at<br>
the pelletizer connection in its start-up position, i.e. it blocks it and diverts the melt<br>
loss so that the melt flow entering at the melt generator connection does not move<br>
to the pelletizer connection, but instead exits at a bypass opening of the valve and<br>
as a rule simply flows onto the floor. If the pelletizer device has started up so that all<br>
the units are working with the desired operating parameters and the melt flow has<br>
reached the desired quality, the diverter gate is switched over to its production<br>
position so that the melt flow in the diverter valve flows to its pelletizer connection<br>
and is then processed to pellets by the pelletizer connected there.<br>
The start-up phase of a production process can admittedly be effected per se in a<br>
satisfactory manner using such known diverter valves; however, problems occur on<br>
the changing from one production process to a second production process, for<br>
example on a change of the polymer/filler mixture, on a change of the pellet<br>
geometry, on a changeover to changed throughput demands, on a change in the<br>
color of the pellets or also on scheduled or unscheduled production interruptions<br>
e.g. for repairs to the nozzle plate. The problem which results in this process is that<br>
the total diverter valve, including the melt passage in the interior of the valve, has to<br>
be cleaned completely before the plant can be started up again. Without such a<br>
cleaning, contaminations of long duration would occur, for example on the<br>
changeover from colored pellets to white pellets. Conventional diverter valves have<br>
to be dismantled for cleaning as a rule, whereby the production process is<br>
interrupted for a longer duration. Moreover, subsequent to the cleaning, the fitting<br>
time has to be taken into account which is needed, for example, for the heating of<br>
the diverter gate to operating temperature.<br><br>
The possible alternative of having two separate diverter valves available for such<br>
changes between two production processes is not acceptable for a number of<br>
operators of such plant. On the one hand, the costs for two complete diverter valves<br>
are incurred. Apart from this, time delays also occur on the use of two separate<br>
diverter valves, e.g. due to the ramping up of the new diverter valve to operating<br>
temperature.<br>
Furthermore, DE 696 21 101 T2 describes the possibility of viscosity change within<br>
a compounding process with subsequent pelletization in a corresponding large-<br>
production plant having a performance of at least 1000 kg/h. Two pelletizer heads<br>
are connected to the valve connected downstream of the melt generator so that<br>
highly viscose material can be given to the one pelletizing head and low-viscose<br>
material can be given to the other pelletizing head by switching over the valve. The<br>
problems of the start-up losses are, however, not solved in this process; it is rather<br>
the case that material not yet pelletizable should be discharged via a bypass<br>
opening in a manner known per se up to the reaching of the respective operating<br>
point. Furthermore, a pelletizing apparatus is described in DE 197 54 863 C2 in<br>
which two pelletizing heads are connected to a 1/3 valve so that, on a color change<br>
from black material to white material or vice versa, the one or the other pelletizing<br>
head can selectively be selected. To so-to-say flush out color contaminations on a<br>
color change in this process, a central bypass outlet is provided in the valve via<br>
which material of the new color is discharged for so long after a change of color in<br>
the melt generator until even the last contaminants have been taken along. This is<br>
more counter-productive than helpful with respect to the aforesaid objective of<br>
reducing start-up losses and of decreasing expensive material waste. Finally, a<br>
multiway rotary valve for pelletizing plant is known from DE 100 30 584 with whose<br>
help its high molecular plastic melts can be distributed or split up. The problems of<br>
the start-up losses are, however, also not addressed in this reference.<br>
With a customary design of an underwater pelletizing plant, the start-up losses<br>
which occur and the corresponding material loss are definitely cost intensive. In<br><br>
particular with polymers or plastics sensitive to freezing, e.g. products with a high<br>
crystallite melting point, it is necessary to start and to operate at a minimal<br>
throughput of more than 10 kg/h per nozzle bore. After the actual starting process,<br>
the subsequent throughput increase is unproblematic as a rule. However, material<br>
losses arise due to the starting process itself due to start-up product in block form<br>
on the floor which can easily amount to several kilograms. This is not only<br>
uneconomical because the expensive raw materials are transferred in a non-<br>
sellable form, but is also unpleasant for the operator of a corresponding production<br>
plant since the blocks can turn out relatively large and have to be reduced to small<br>
particles in an expensive process and finally have to be disposed of. Such a hot<br>
melting block having temperatures of, optionally, more than 250°C, and discharged<br>
via the bypass outlet of the diverter valve not least also represents a potential<br>
safety risk. The problems of the discharge of plastic melt via the bypass outlet does<br>
not only occur in the actual start-up of a corresponding production plant for a new<br>
production job, but also when, for whatever different reasons, the plant has to be<br>
operated out of the throughput window of the pelletizing head, in particular when<br>
the melt volume flow has to be operated below the lower capacity limit of the<br>
respective pelletizer head. Here, too, the diverter valve sometimes has to be<br>
switched into the bypass position so that corresponding material waste arises.<br>
It is therefore the underlying object of the present invention to provide an improved<br>
pelletizing method as well as a diverter valve of the named kind which avoids<br>
disadvantages of the prior art and further develops it in an advantageous manner.<br>
Preferably, a ramping up of the pelletizing should be achieved with start-up losses<br>
which are as low as possible and also an operation should be achieved which is as<br>
continuous as possible without intermediate interruptions of the process and restart-<br>
up losses.<br>
This object is solved in accordance with the invention by a method in accordance<br>
with claim 1 as well as an apparatus in accordance with claim 10 and a diverter<br>
valve in accordance with claim 30. Preferred configurations of the invention are the<br>
subject of the dependent claims.<br><br>
The present invention therefore starts from the idea of using a plurality of pelletizing<br>
heads with different passage capacities and of hereby enlarging the throughput<br>
windows to be able to work largely continuously without intermediate interruptions<br>
and to shorten unavoidable start-up processes by switching in pelletizing heads<br>
having small throughput capacities or to minimize them with respect to the start-up<br>
products which occur. In accordance with an aspect of the present invention, a<br>
plurality of pelletizing heads having different throughput capacities are used<br>
sequentially for the start-up of the pelletizing process, with the melt first being<br>
supplied to a first pelletizing head having a smaller throughput capacity and then<br>
the melt volume flow being increased and the diverter valve being switched over<br>
such that the melt is diverted by the diverter valve to a second pelletizing head<br>
having a larger throughput capacity. The time and thus the amount of the start-up<br>
product until the melt generator reaches the lower throughput limit of the pelletizing<br>
head and the pelletizing process can be started are cut by the use of initially one<br>
pelletizing head having a throughput capacity which is as low as possible. No<br>
further start-up product is incurred from the start onwards of the pelletizing process<br>
at the lower throughput limit of the said first pelletizing head. The melt volume flow<br>
is increased quantitatively for so long until the diverter valve can be switched to the<br>
second pelletizing head having the larger throughput capacity with no start-up<br>
product being incurred during this time period. Moreover, the throughput window is<br>
enlarged in total so that the number of unavoidable start-up procedures with start-<br>
up product arising therein is reduced since it is possible, on a ramping down of the<br>
melting performance below the lower throughput limit of the larger pelletizing head<br>
which may become necessary for various reasons, to switch back to the first<br>
pelletizing head.<br>
In a technical apparatus respect, it is proposed in accordance with an aspect of the<br>
present invention that the pelletizing apparatus of the initially named kind has a<br>
control apparatus for the control of the switching gate of the diverter valve in<br>
dependence on the melt volume flow of the melt generator. The diverter valve can<br>
be switched to the pelletizing head having the smaller passage capacity with a<br><br>
small melt volume flow by means of this control apparatus, whereas the diverter<br>
valve is switched to the second pelletizing head having the larger throughput<br>
capacity with a larger melt volume flow. A considerable increase in efficiency can<br>
already be achieved by such a control apparatus, independently of the aforesaid<br>
start-up process, in that the throughput window of the apparatus is enlarged and it<br>
is possible to work over a larger operating range without interruptions so that fewer<br>
start-up processes become necessary. In this connection, the control apparatus can<br>
generally realize different degrees of automation, for example, be configured semi-<br>
automatically such that it emits an indication on the reaching of a melt volume flow<br>
which permits an operation of the second pelletizing head having the larger<br>
throughput capacity, said indication drawing the attention of a plant operator thereto<br>
and such that, after a corresponding input by the plant operator, the diverter valve<br>
then switching in the aforesaid manner to the second pelletizing head having the<br>
larger throughput capacity so that the melt flow is diverted from the first pelletizing<br>
head to the second pelletizing head. The control apparatus can also be configured<br>
to be fully automatic in a particularly advantageous manner such that it<br>
automatically switches the diverter valve to the respectively matching pelletizing<br>
head on the determination of a corresponding melt volume flow.<br>
In a further development of the invention, the control apparatus can in particular<br>
have control means which switch the diverter valve to the first pelletizing head<br>
having a smaller throughput capacity when the melt volume flow is below a lower<br>
capacity limit of the second pelletizing head having a larger throughput capacity, but<br>
above a lower capacity limit of the first pelletizing head and which switch the<br>
diverter valve to the second pelletizing head when the melt volume flow is above<br>
the lower capacity limit of the second pelletizing limit and still below a lower<br>
capacity limit of an optionally present third pelletizing head having an even larger<br>
throughput capacity.<br>
The control apparatus can advantageously also have volume flow control means for<br>
the control of the volume flow which is directed into the diverter valve by the melt<br>
generator. Generally, in this process, different melt producers with variable volume<br><br>
flow can be used; for example, the melt flow can then be generated via a<br>
corresponding screw extruder and simultaneously be varied with respect to its<br>
volume. Optionally, however, a gear pump can also be interposed between the melt<br>
generator and the diverter valve to control the volume flow accordingly. To be able<br>
to adapt the process in as variable a manner as possible to different conditions, the<br>
control apparatus is advantageously configured such that it can vary, preferably<br>
continuously vary, the volume flow, also within the capacity limits of a pelletizing<br>
head.<br>
The melt volume flow can in particular be continuously increased within the<br>
throughput capacity limits of the first pelletizing head on the start-up of the<br>
pelletizing process on the pelletizing with the first pelletizing head having a smaller<br>
throughput capacity, i.e. still before the switching over of the diverter valve to the<br>
second pelletizing head. Since pelletizing is already taking place with the first<br>
pelletizing head, no start-up product is incurred, with the plant being moved<br>
continuously to the pelletizing process having the second, larger pelletizing head<br>
due to the increase of the melt volume flow.<br>
The diverter valve is advantageously only switched over to the second pelletizer<br>
head when the melt volume flow has been increased up to the lower capacity limit<br>
of the second pelletizing head and/or the upper capacity limit of the first pelletizing<br>
head.<br>
Generally, the diverter valve can be switched to the first pelletizing head on the<br>
start-up of the pelletizing plant from its bypass position in which start-up product is<br>
directed to the floor or to a suitable storage container when the minimal conditions<br>
for a successful start have been reached. The diverter valve can in particular be<br>
switched from the start-up position to the first pelletizing head in a further<br>
development of the invention in dependence on the melt viscosity, on the mass<br>
temperature, on the mass pressure, the degassing state and/or the reaching of the<br>
required minimal volume flow. Corresponding means for the determination can<br>
advantageously be provided in a technical apparatus respect, preferably sensors<br><br>
for the detection of the said parameters, so that the control apparatus can switch<br>
the diverter valve accordingly in dependence on the corresponding signals. Instead<br>
of corresponding sensors, the said parameters can also be estimated. In addition to<br>
the said parameters, even further parameters such as the color, filler induction or<br>
further melt parameters or pelletizing parameters can be taken into account for the<br>
switching over of the diverter valve to the first pelletizing head.<br>
In a similar manner, the switching over of the diverter valve from the first pelletizing<br>
head to the second pelletizing head or from the nth pelletizing head to the n+1th<br>
pelletizing head can also take place not only in dependence on the reaching of the<br>
required minimal volume flow for the second or n+1th pelletizing head, but<br>
alternatively or additionally thereto in dependence on further parameters. The<br>
diverter valve can in particular be switched from the first pelletizing head to the<br>
second pelletizing head in dependence on the pellet size, the melt mass pressure,<br>
the mass temperature of the melt or further parameters such as the pellet shape,<br>
surface tackiness, agglomeration, occurrence of double grains, crystallization<br>
effects, etc. If, for example, no further upward latitude is given on the reaching of<br>
the maximally possible pelletizer speed in the first pelletizing head, so that the<br>
correct pellet size can only be maintained or can only be reached again by<br>
switching over to the next pelletizer, the diverter valve can be switched over to the<br>
larger pelletizing head. Alternatively or additionally, this switchover can be carried<br>
out when the mass pressure of the melt rises above a corresponding limit value.<br>
When throughput performances are increased, the head pressure usually also<br>
increases, which can be restrictive with some products since damage due to<br>
shearing based on the pressure can occur. As a consequence thereof, the mass<br>
temperature of the melt can also increase too pronouncedly, whereby similar<br>
consequences occur. A switchover can also be a remedy here. When the pellet<br>
shape is taken into account, a critical deformation of the pellets which arises on the<br>
increase of the volume flow per bore can e.g. be used as the criterion. A switchover<br>
to the larger pelletizing head can also help here in dependence on the sensitivity of<br>
the material produced and on the demands on the pellet quality. Other secondary<br>
switchover necessities can moreover be derived from the pellet size which are,<br><br>
however, ultimately correlated with the grain size of the pellets, namely the surface<br>
tackiness, the agglomeration, double-grain, different crystallization effects based on<br>
a different size and temperature of the pellets and the like.<br>
To achieve a throughput window, and thus operating window, which is as wide as<br>
possible with as few pelletizing heads as possible, but simultaneously to ensure a<br>
switchover of the melt processing which is as free of problems as possible from the<br>
one pelletizing head to the other pelletizing head, the pelletizing heads connected<br>
to the diverter valve have mutually complementary throughput capacity ranges,<br>
preferably throughput capacity ranges seamlessly adjoining one another.<br>
Optionally, the capacity ranges could also overlap, with it, however, nevertheless<br>
applying overall for the increase of the throughput window that the throughput<br>
capacity region defined by both pelletizing heads is larger than that of only one<br>
pelletizing head. A maximal utilization of each capacity range can be achieved by a<br>
configuration of the pelletizing heads such that their capacity ranges seamlessly<br>
adjoin one another. For example, when the pelletizing apparatus is configured for<br>
the pelletizing for PET, a first pelletizing head having a throughput performance<br>
span from 2500 kg/h up to 4500 kg/h, a second pelletizing head having a<br>
throughput capacity of 4500 kg/h up to 7500 kg/h and a third pelletizing head<br>
having a throughput capacity of 7500 kg/h up to 12,500 kg/h can be used. It is<br>
understood that the capacity limits can be selected differently, with them<br>
advantageously seamlessly complementing one another in a corresponding<br>
manner, however.<br>
Generally, the pelletizing heads can be configured for different pelletizing<br>
processes. In accordance with an advantageous embodiment of the invention, the<br>
pelletizing heads can form underwater pelletizing heads. Alternatively, the<br>
pelletizing heads can also form extrusion pelletizing heads or water ring pelletizing<br>
heads.<br>
In an advantageous further development of the invention, all the pelletizing heads<br>
are of the same type, for example underwater pelletizing heads.<br><br>
In an alternative configuration of the invention, however, the pelletizing heads can<br>
also realize different pelletizing types; for example, the pelletizing head having a<br>
smaller throughput capacity can be an underwater pelletizing head, whereas the<br>
pelletizing head having a larger throughput performance is an extrusion pelletizing<br>
head.<br>
The diverter valve is advantageously configured such that a diversion of the melt<br>
flow from one pelletizing head to the next pelletizing head is made possible which is<br>
as rapid and as free of interruption as possible.<br>
The bidirectionally operable diverter valve for different process stages preferably<br>
has different flow paths for the melt so that the diverter valve for a first process<br>
stage can be operated with a first flow path and can selectively be operated for a<br>
second process stage via a second flow path. It can selectively output the melt via a<br>
first or a second pelletizer connection. The respective other, not operated, flow path<br>
or pelletizer connection can simultaneously be cleaned for production via the flow<br>
path in operation so that down times occurring hereby are omitted. The flow path or<br>
pelletizer connection not in operation nevertheless remains at temperature since<br>
the heat introduced by the melt naturally also heats up the non-operated part of the<br>
diverter valve.<br>
In accordance with an advantageous embodiment of the present invention, the<br>
diverter valve can largely realize the plurality of production paths starting from only<br>
one melt generator connection. In accordance with this embodiment of the<br>
invention, the diverter valve has, in addition to the first pelletizer connection, a<br>
second pelletizer connection which can be connected to the same melt producer<br>
connection as the first pelletizer connection. To be able to allow the melt flow to be<br>
discharged selectively via the first pelletizer connection or the second pelletizer<br>
connection, the diverter valve has a switching gate which connects the melt<br>
generator connection to the first pelletizer connection in a first production position<br><br>
and connects the said melt generator connection to the second pelletizer<br>
connection in a second production position.<br>
The polymer melt can hereby quickly be diverted to one of the two nozzle<br>
geometries installed at the pelletizer connections. The respective other nozzle<br>
geometry is so-to-say in stand-by and is not used. A switchover between the two<br>
possible production devices can be carried out in seconds by actuation of the<br>
switching gate.<br>
In a further development of the invention, a diverter gate can be provided in the<br>
melt passage selectively connecting the melt producer connection to one of the two<br>
pelletizer connections, said diverter gate switching the melt passage through to the<br>
respective pelletizer connection in its production position, whereas it diverts the<br>
melt flow in its start-up position and gives it to a bypass opening.<br>
The aforesaid switching gate for the switchover between the production directions<br>
and the diverter gate for the start-up process can generally be made separate from<br>
one another. In a further development of the invention, however, they are coupled<br>
to one another, are in particular formed by a common valve body and are actuable<br>
by a common valve actuator.<br>
In a further development of the invention, the diverter valve can also have a third or<br>
a further pelletizer connection, which can be connected to the melt passage, in<br>
addition to the first and second pelletizer connections. In this connection, the<br>
switching gate is preferably configured such that it connects the third pelletizer<br>
connection to the melt generator connection in a third production position.<br>
Accordingly, the diverter valve can even switch over between more than two<br>
production directions.<br>
In accordance with an aspect of the present invention, the diverter valve has a<br>
second production path made completely separate from the first production path. In<br>
addition to the first melt generator connection, to the first pelletizer connection and<br><br>
to the first melt passage for the connection of the said first melt generator<br>
connection and the pelletizer connection, the valve in accordance with this<br>
embodiment has a second pelletizer connection as well as a second melt generator<br>
connection which can be connected to one another by a second melt passage. In<br>
this option, the change from a first production process to a second production<br>
process can advantageously take place particularly fast in that the initially used melt<br>
connection and pelletizer connection are released by means of quick-closing<br>
couplings and the diverter valve with the second melt connection and pelletizer<br>
connection and corresponding quick-couplings is again installed between the melt<br>
generator and the pelletizer after a minimal mechanical conversion and a<br>
corresponding rotation of the diverter valve itself. The second melt passage is in the<br>
cleaned state, on the one hand, and is already pre-heated by the preceding<br>
production process, on the other hand, so that the new production process can be<br>
started quickly.<br>
In this connection, a diverter gate is provided in the said first melt passage and in<br>
the said second melt passage and switches through the respective melt passage in<br>
a production position so that the melt flow can flow from the inlet opening of the<br>
respective melt generator connection to the outlet opening of the associated<br>
pelletizer connection and diverts the melt flow in a start-up position, i.e. blocks the<br>
respective pelletizer connection and directs the melt flow to a bypass opening so<br>
that the start-up procedure can take place in a manner known per se for the new<br>
production process.<br>
In this connection, the diverter gate of the first melt passage and the diverter gate of<br>
the second melt passage are advantageously realized in a common valve member<br>
and can be actuated by a common valve actuator. Only a control mimicry is hereby<br>
required for the switchover from the start-up position to the production position of<br>
both production paths. The corresponding components such as the valve actuator,<br>
the control electronics, etc. can be dispensed with with respect to the use of two<br>
separate diverter valves so that this solution is characterized by its cost efficiency.<br><br>
Switch-through passages both for the first melt passage and for the second melt<br>
passage and corresponding bypass passages are provided in the valve member for<br>
the diversion of the melt flow of the first melt passage and of the melt flow of the<br>
second melt passage to a bypass opening in each case.<br>
The diverter gates formed by the valve member are advantageously configured<br>
such that both diverter gates are simultaneously in their production position and<br>
simultaneously in their start-up position. When both production paths of the diverter<br>
valve are used simultaneously, the corresponding production processes can hereby<br>
be started up simultaneously. If only one of the two production paths of the diverter<br>
valve is used, the non-used production path is open in a throughgoing manner so<br>
that it can be cleaned completely while the other production path is being used.<br>

directed to one of the three pelletizing heads or to a bypass line.<br>
The diverter valve 1 shown in Figure 1 has a valve housing 2 at whose outer side a<br>
first melt generator connection 3 as well as a second melt generator connection 4<br>
as well as furthermore a first pelletizer connection 5 and a second pelletizer<br>
connection 6 are provided. As Figure 1 shows, the connections 3 to 6 are<br>
distributed over the periphery of the valve housing 4 and are arranged on<br>
respective oppositely disposed sides. The first melt generator connection 3 is<br>
disposed opposite the first pelletizer connection 5, whereas the second melt<br>
generator connection 4 is disposed opposite the second pelletizer connection 6.<br>
The melt generator connection and the pelletizer connection can be brought into<br>
flow communication with one another. For this purpose, a first melt passage 7 (cf.<br>
Figures 1 and 5) is provided in the interior of the valve housing 2 through which the<br>
first melt generator connection 3 can be connected to the first pelletizer connection<br>
5 and a second melt passage 8 (cf. Figures 4 and 6) is provided through which the<br>
second melt generator connection 4 can be connected to the second pelletizer<br>
connection 6. The melt passages 7 and 8 communicate in this connection with<br>
corresponding inlet openings 10 and 11 at the two melt generator connections 3<br><br>
and 4 and to corresponding outlet openings 12 and 13 at the pelletizer connections<br>
5 and 6.<br>
The two melt passages 7 and 8 having the respective associated first melt<br>
generator connection and pelletizer connection 3 and 5 or the second melt<br>
generator connection and pelletizer connection 4 and 6 form mutually independent<br>
and separately operable production directions. The flow path for the melt through<br>
the one melt passage has no overlap with the flow path through the second melt<br>
passage. The two melt passages are only linked to one another to the extent that a<br>
common diverter valve is provided for both melt passages, as will still be explained.<br>
As Figures 1, 2 and 3 show, the matching first melt generator connection and<br>
pelletizer connection 3 and 5 together with the first melt passage 7 connecting them<br>
vertically offset with respect to the likewise matching second melt generator<br>
connection and pelletizer connection 4 and 6 and the associated second melt<br>
passage 8. The first melt passage 7 between the first melt generator connection<br>
and pelletizer connection 3 and 5 extends above the second melt passage 8<br>
between the second melt generator connection and pelletizer connection 4 and 6<br>
and beyond them. It is understood that other arrangements are also possible here,<br>
e.g. the four connections 3 - 6 could generally be arranged at the same vertical<br>
level and the melt passages could, for example, extend beyond one another by an<br>
arcuate extension. The embodiments shown in the Figures are, however,<br>
characterized by their simple manufacturing capability based on the straight extent<br>
of the melt passages 7 and 8.<br>
In the interior of the valve housing or valve body 2, a diverter gate 14 is provided<br>
which is associated with the two melt passages 7 and 8 and can divert the melt flow<br>
in each of the melt passages 7 and 8 to a bypass opening for the start-up process.<br>
The diverter gate 14 in the drawn embodiment comprises a substantially cylindrical<br>
valve gate 15 which is longitudinally displaceably received in a valve bore which<br>
extends vertically in the drawn embodiment and which extends transversely to the<br>
longitudinal axes of the melt passages 7 and 8. It is understood that the valve gate<br>
15 could optionally also be configured as a rotary slide which is not actuated by<br><br>
axial longitudinal displacement, but by rotation around its longitudinal axis. Further<br>
valve principles are possible.<br>
As Figures 1 to 5 show, the valve gate 15 is actuated by a valve actuator 16 which<br>
is arranged on the upper side of the valve housing 2 and is controlled by an<br>
electronic control unit 17. The valve actuator 16 can realize different operative<br>
principles, e.g. work electromagnetically or hydraulically or pneumatically. It effects<br>
the adjustment of the valve gate 15 between its production position and its start-up<br>
position or bypass position.<br>
In the production position shown in Figures 5 to 7 of the valve gate 15, it switches<br>
through the two melt passages 7 and 8, i.e. the melt flow entering at the respective<br>
inlet openings 10 and 11 at the melt generator connections 3 and 4 is directed<br>
through the melt passages 7 and 8 beyond the valve gate 15 to the associated<br>
outlet openings 12 and 13 of the pelletizer connections 5 and 6. As Figures 4 to 7<br>
show, the melt passages 7 and 8 each open onto the valve bore into which the<br>
valve gate 15 is inserted. Two production passages 18 and 19 are provided in the<br>
valve gate 15 and continue the melt passages 7 and 8 so-to-say in the position of<br>
the valve gate 16 shown in Figures 5 to 7.<br>
If the valve gate 15 is moved with the help of the valve actuator 16 from the<br>
production position shown in Figures 5 to 7 into the start-up position shown in<br>
Figures 8 to 13, the valve gate 15 blocks the communication of the inlet openings<br>
10 and 11 at the melt generator connections 3 and 4 with the outlet openings 12<br>
and 13 at the pelletizer connections 5 and 6. The valve gate 15 diverts the melt flow<br>
entering at the inlet opening 10 and/or at the inlet opening 11 to a bypass opening<br>
so that the melt flow is directed to the floor on start-up. For this purpose, the valve<br>
gate 15 has to bypass passages 20 and 21 which are in flow communication with<br>
the melt passages 7 and 8, more precisely with their sections originating from the<br>
inlet openings 10 and 11 in the start-up position of the valve gate 15 shown in<br>
Figures 9 to 14 and so-to-say pick up the melt flow coming from there. At the other<br>
end, the two bypass passages 20 and 21 open into bypass outlet openings in the<br><br>
end face of the valve gage 15 whose lower end face is in communication with the<br>
outer side of the valve housing 2.<br>
In particular two use possibilities present themselves for the diverter valve 1 shown<br>
in Figures 1 to 13. On the one hand, the diverter valve 1 can be used with in each<br>
case only one of the melt generator connections 3 and 4 and with only one of the<br>
pelletizer connections 5 and 6 at a defined point in time. That is, only one of the two<br>
production directions is used, whereas the other production direction, i.e. the other<br>
pair of melt generator and pelletizer connections remains unused and is kept so-to-<br>
say on stand-by. If the correspondingly running production process should be<br>
interrupted and a new production process started, the diverter valve is released<br>
from the respective melt generator and pelletizer via quick-closing couplings. The<br>
valve is rotated through 90° and then installed at the melt generator and at the<br>
pelletizer for the production process to be started using the previously unused melt<br>
generator connection and pelletizer connection. This new production process can<br>
be started in a manner known per se in that first the diverter gate 14 is moved to its<br>
start-up position in accordance with Figures 8 to 13 so that the melt drops to the<br>
floor during the start-up procedure. Once the plant has been started up, the diverter<br>
gate 14 is moved into its production position in accordance with Figures 2 to 7 so<br>
that the new melt flow is guided from the pelletizer beyond the diverter gate to the<br>
connected pelletizer. The changeover times are hereby minimized. Time is above<br>
all saved for the cleaning of the diverter valve. The cleaning of the previously used<br>
production passage can take place after the valve with the fresh production<br>
passage has been connected and the new production process is already running. It<br>
is moreover advantageous that the diverter valve is already at least approximately<br>
at operating temperature since it was still heated from the previously interrupted<br>
production process.<br>
On the other hand, the diverter valve 1 described above also provides the option of<br>
using both production passages simultaneously, i.e. of connecting both melt<br>
generator connections 3 and 4 to one or more melt generators and equally to<br>
connect the two pelletizer connections 5 and 6 to two pelletizers simultaneously.<br><br>
The previously described configuration of the diverter gate 14 ensures in this<br>
process that initially both production passages are switched to the start-up position,<br>
i.e. both processes can be started up. A soon as both processes have started up,<br>
the diverter gate 14 can be switched over to start both production processes.<br>
Independently of whether the production processes are operated sequentially or<br>
simultaneously, the diverter gate 1 advantageously provides the opportunity of<br>
operating two production processes which are the same or also which are<br>
completely different. For instance, pelletizing processes which are the same in each<br>
case such as extrusion pelletizing or underwater pelletization can be operated via<br>
the first melt generator connection and pelletizer connection 3 and 5 and via the<br>
second melt generator connection and pelletizer connection 4 and 6, but also<br>
different pelletizing processes can be operated, i.e. extrusion processing on the one<br>
and underwater pelletization on the other. In this respect, the respectively required<br>
nozzle plates can be used which can either have the same section geometry and<br>
number of bores, the same section geometry and a different number of bores, a<br>
different section geometry and the same number of bores or both a different section<br>
geometry and a different number of bores or which can also realize one of these<br>
possible combinations in different constructional sizes.<br>
The second embodiment of the diverter valve 1 in accordance with Figures 14 to 17<br>
substantially differs from the previously described first embodiment in that the<br>
diverter valve has, instead of two melt generator connections, only one melt<br>
generator connection 3 which can be selectively connected to the first pelletizer<br>
connection 5 or the second pelletizer connection 6 or which can be connected to<br>
the bypass opening in the start-up position of the valve. To the extent that the<br>
diverter valve 1 in accordance with Figures 14 to 17 agrees with the previously<br>
described embodiment, the same components are provided with the same<br>
reference numerals and reference is made to this extent to the previous description.<br>
As Figures 14 and 15 show, in this embodiment, the melt generator connection 3<br>
and the two pelletizer connections 5 and 6 are arranged at the same level (cf.<br><br>
Figure 14) and are in communication with one respective melt passage 7, 7a and<br>
7b which extend in each case radially inwardly from the inlet opening 10 or the<br>
outlet openings 12 and 13 and all three open in the valve bore in which the valve<br>
gate 15 is received. The valve gate 15 of the diverter gate 14 is axially adjustable in<br>
the previously described manner. It includes two production passages 18 and 19<br>
(cf. Figures 16 and 17). In the first production position of the valve gate 15, which<br>
Figure 16 shows, the diverter gate 14 switches the inlet opening 10 of the melt<br>
generator connection 3 through to the outlet opening 12 of the first pelletizer<br>
connection 5. The first production passage 18 continues the melt passage 7 coming<br>
from the melt generator connection 3 to the section 7a of the melt passage in<br>
communication with the first pelletizer connection 5 so that the melt flow entering<br>
via the inlet opening 10 moves to the pelletizer installed at the first pelletizer<br>
connection 5.<br>
If the valve gate 15 moves into its second production position, which Figure 17<br>
shows, the diverter gate 14 switches the first melt generator connection 3 to the<br>
second pelletizer connection 6. The second production passage 19 in the valve<br>
gate 15 continues the melt passage 7 coming from the inlet opening 10 to the<br>
section 7b of the melt passage in communication with the second pelletizer<br>
connection 6 so that the melt flow entering via the inlet opening 10 can move to the<br>
pelletizer which is connected to the second pelletizer connection 6.<br>
Furthermore, the valve gate 15 can be moved into a start-up position or a bypass<br>
position, which Figure 15 shows. In this position, the valve gate 15 blocks both<br>
pelletizer connections 5 and 6 and directs the melt flow entering via the inlet<br>
opening 10 via the bypass passage 20 formed in the valve gate 15 to a bypass<br>
opening which is provided at the end face at the lower end of the valve gate 15. The<br>
melt can be directed to the floor in the previously described manner via this bypass<br>
opening on the start-up of the plant.<br>
In this second embodiment of the diverter valve 1, in each case only one of the two<br>
outlet openings 12 and 13 are therefore served via a common inlet at a defined<br><br>
point in time. The polymer melt entering via the inlet opening 10 is diverted to one<br>
of the pelletizer connections, whereas the respective other is in stand-by and is<br>
therefore not used. The switchover can take place in a matter of seconds by<br>
actuation of the diverter gate 14.<br>
In simple processes, the diverter gate 14 could also only have its two production<br>
positions and could dispense with the bypass position and the corresponding<br>
bypass passage 20. In this process, the so-called start-up product could then be<br>
reshaped to pellets on the then smaller pelletizer, whereby the otherwise usually<br>
large start-up positions would be completely dispensed with.<br>
In particular the second embodiment of the diverter valve 1 can be used where<br>
complex plant should be operated with units which are as small as possible and in<br>
very restricted space. The switchover possibility during operation makes it possible<br>
to avoid interruptions to a very large extent or to realize a very wide throughput<br>
processing window on one production machine by a clever selection of the two<br>
pelletizer heads.<br>
Two pelletizing processes which are the same, that is, for example, extrusion<br>
pelletization at both pelletizer connections 5 and 6 or also underwater pelletization<br>
processes at both connections, can also be operated in this embodiment of the<br>
diverter gate 1 via the two pelletizer connections 5 and 6. However, different<br>
pelletization processes can also be operated, e.g. extrusion pelletization at the one<br>
pelletizer connection and an underwater pelletization at the other pelletizer<br>
connection. In any case, nozzle plates can be used at the two pelletizer<br>
connections 5 and 6 which have the same section geometry and number of bores,<br>
the same section geometry with a different number of bores, a different section<br>
geometry with the same number of bores or a different number of bores. It is<br>
understood that nozzle plates in different construction sizes can also be used with<br>
each of these possibilities.<br><br>
Interesting use possibilities in particular result when different pelletizer construction<br>
sizes are used at the two pelletizer connections 5 and 6. The volume flow window<br>
achievable with a machine can thus e.g. be considerably increased by different<br>
nozzle plates. The loss quantity per start-up process can moreover be considerably<br>
reduced, whereby less material loss arises overall which then has to be disposed of<br>
or treated, on the one hand, and a faster start is achieved, on the other hand, which<br>
means less personnel and less handling overall.<br>
The described diverter valve 1 in accordance with Figures 14 to 17 is used in a<br>
particularly advantageous manner in an underwater apparatus 23 as is shown in<br>
Figure 18, with pelletizer heads 24 and 25 having different throughput capacities<br>
advantageously being connected to the two pelletizer connections 5 and 6. As<br>
Figure 18 shows, the melt supplied horizontally via an extruder 26 and/or via a gear<br>
pump 27 is pressed via the diverter valve 1 through the radially arranged bores of<br>
the nozzle plate 28 of one of the two pelletizing heads 24 or 25. The strands are cut<br>
directly to pellets on discharge from the said nozzle plate 28 in the completely<br>
flooded cutting chamber and are transported away by the water flow 29, with the<br>
melt solidifying abruptly due to the high temperature difference to the process water<br>
so that the spherical shape of the pellets characteristic for underwater pelletization<br>
arises in dependence on the viscosity. As Figure 18 illustrates, the pellet/water<br>
mixture exiting the cutting chamber of the respective pelletizing head 24 or 25 is<br>
supplied by means of a transport line 30 to an agglomerate collector 31 which is<br>
positioned upstream of a centrifugal drier 32.<br>
When the plant is started up, the diverter gate 1, as first shown in Figure 19a, is<br>
moved into its bypass position so that the melt flow is diverted to the floor. The melt<br>
volume flow is continuously increased by a central control apparatus 33 by a<br>
corresponding control of the extruder 26 and/or of the gear pump 28 until a lower<br>
capacity limit of the first pelletizing head 24 having the smaller throughput capacity<br>
is reached. As already mentioned, it is in particular necessary with polymers<br>
sensitive to freezing, e.g. with products having a high crystallite melting point, to<br>
start and to operate at a minimum throughput of, for example, more than 10 kg/h<br><br>
per nozzle bore. It is also necessary to ramp up apparatus components, including<br>
the diverter valve 1, to a predetermined minimum temperature which can be<br>
material dependent.<br>
As soon as the lower capacity limit of the named first pelletizing head 24 has been<br>
reached and/or further operating parameters characteristic for the plant or<br>
characteristic for the material have been reached, the control apparatus 33 controls<br>
the diverter valve 1 such that the valve gate 15 is moved into its first production<br>
position in which the melt is directed to the first pelletizing head 24. Figure 20<br>
illustrates this smaller melt volume flow on the first pelletizing head 24 by the arrow<br>
A.<br>
As soon as the pelletization through the first pelletizing head 24 has started up, the<br>
melt volume flow is further increased until the lower capacity limit of the second<br>
pelletizing head 25 has been reached which is above the lower capacity limit of the<br>
first pelletizing head 24 and is advantageously approximately in the range of the<br>
upper capacity limit of the said first pelletizing head 24. The capacity ranges of the<br>
named two pelletizing heads 24 and 25 preferably adjoin one another seamlessly or<br>
a slight overlap can be provided. Once the melt volume flow has been ramped up to<br>
the said lower capacity limit of the second pelletizing head 25, the control apparatus<br>
33 controls the valve gate 15 into its second production position so that the volume<br>
flow is diverted from the first pelletizing head 24 to the second pelletizing head 25 in<br>
a matter of seconds.<br>
Substantial increases in efficiency can be achieved and start-up losses can be<br>
avoided by the start-up of the pelletization process of the second, larger pelletizing<br>
head 25 with interposition of the pelletizing process via the first, smaller pelletizing<br>
head 24.<br>
The economic advantage should be illustrated by the following examples:<br>
Example 1:<br><br>
A pelletization for PP compounds starting from a double screw extruder having e.g.<br>
150 bores in the nozzle plate and an assumed volume flow window of 10 kg/h and<br>
bore up to 35 kg/h and bore normally processes between 1,500 kg/h and up to<br>
5,250 kg/h. In this process, the cutting speed of the pelletizer is necessarily<br>
feedback tracked by the factor of 3.5; one starts at 1,500 kg/h and 1,030 l/min of a<br>
given blade combination and increases the blade speed in linear fashion to 3,600<br>
l/min for 5,250 kg/h. The pellets generated in this manner then each have the same<br>
weight. If a 2nd pelletizing head were now installed at this given machine having,<br>
for example, 45 bores and the resulting capacity from 450 - 1,575 kg/h, the<br>
production window increases to approximately factor 12. The same machine could<br>
thus generate from 450 - 5,250 kg/h of high-quality pellets.<br>
When the worst-case scenario is taken into account (approximately 3 minutes start-<br>
up requirement up to the actual start with a minimum required throughput<br>
performance), this means for the above case:<br>
With a standard diverter valve:<br>
3 minutes x 1,500 kg/h = 75 kg material losses, per start-up process.<br>
With a bidirectional diverter valve, this would mean:<br>
3 minutes x 450 kg/h = 22.5 kg material losses, per start-up process.<br>
There is in addition the fact that the same production machine which requires 3<br>
minutes for the manufacture of 1,500 kg, will reach the 450 kg/h substantially faster.<br>
This can in turn reduce the start-up time to a third, which then means in sum:<br>
54 seconds x 450 kg/h = 6.75 kg material losses, per start-up process<br>
As documented in this example, this option of the invention therefore opens up a<br>
reduction of the loss quantity per start-up process by a factor 11.11. For the<br>
production facility, this means that, on the one hand, less material loss arises which<br>
then has to be disposed of or treated and, on the other hand, a faster start is<br>
permitted, which means less personnel and less handling overall (plastics have to<br><br>
be sucked up and cooled on discharge from the diverter valve to the bottom = floor,<br>
which naturally directly influences the operating costs).<br>
With only one product change per day and raw material prices of €1.20/kg, this<br>
means that €81.90 can be saved per day; this is an annual savings potential of<br>
€29,839.50 p.a.<br>
Example 2:<br>
A pelletization for PET starting from a reactor having e.g. 250 bores in the nozzle<br>
plate and an assumed volume flow window of 30 kg/h and bore up to 50 kg/h and<br>
bore normally processes between 7,500 kg/h and up to 12,500 kg/h. In this<br>
process, the cutting speed of the pelletizer is necessarily feedback tracked by the<br>
factor of 1.67; one starts at 7,500 kg/h and 1,796 l/min of a given blade combination<br>
and increases the blade speed in linear fashion to 3,000 l/min for 12,500 kg/h. The<br>
pellets generated in this manner then each have the same weight. If a 2nd<br>
pelletizing head were now installed at this given machine having, for example, 150<br>
bores and the resulting capacity from 4,500 - 7,500 kg/h, the production window<br>
increases to approximately factor 2.78. The same machine could thus generate<br>
from 4,500 -12,500 kg/h of high-quality pellets.<br>
When the worst-case scenario is taken into account (approximately 2 minutes start-<br>
up requirement up to the actual start with a minimum required throughput<br>
performance), this means for the above case:<br>
With a standard diverter valve:<br>
2 minutes x 7,500 kg/h = 250 kg material losses, per start-up process.<br>
With a bidirectional diverter valve, this would mean:<br>
2 minutes x 4,500 kg/h = 150 kg material losses, per start-up process.<br><br>
There is in addition the fact that the same production machine which requires 2<br>
minutes for the manufacture of 7,500 kg, will reach the 4,500 kg/h substantially<br>
faster. This can in turn reduce the start-up time, which then means in sum:<br>
72 seconds x 4,500 kg/h = 90 kg material losses, per start-up process<br>
As documented in this example, this option of the invention therefore opens up a<br>
reduction of the loss quantity per start-up process by a factor 2.78. For the<br>
production facility, this means that, on the one hand, less material loss arises which<br>
then has to be disposed of or treated and, on the other hand, a faster start is<br>
permitted, which means less personnel and less handling overall (plastics have to<br>
be sucked up and cooled on discharge from the diverter valve to the bottom = floor,<br>
which naturally directly influences the operating costs).<br>
Example 3:<br>
A pelletization for PET starting from a reactor having e.g. 250 bores in the nozzle<br>
plate and an assumed volume flow window of 30 kg/h and bore up to 50 kg/h and<br>
bore normally processes between 7,500 kg/h and up to 12,500 kg/h. In this<br>
process, the cutting speed of the pelletizer is necessarily feedback tracked by the<br>
factor of 1.67; one starts at 7,500 kg/h and 1,796 l/min of a given blade combination<br>
and increases the blade speed in linear fashion to 3,000 l/min for 12,500 kg/h. The<br>
pellets generated in this manner then each have the same weight. If a 2nd<br>
pelletizing head were now installed at this given machine having, for example, 150<br>
bores and the resulting capacity from 4,500 - 7,500 kg/h, the production window<br>
increases to approximately factor 2.78. The same machine could thus generate<br>
from 4,500 -12,500 kg/h of high-quality pellets. If one were now to use the option of<br>
a multidirectional diverter valve and to install a further third nozzle plate/pelletizing<br>
head combination, as shown in Figure 21, this has the consequence of a further<br>
reduction of the minimum start-up performance. If one e.g. takes a third nozzle with<br>
90 bores, a throughput performance range from 2,700 kg/h up to 4,500 kg/h is<br>
obtained. The pelletizing device is thus ultimately available in the range from 2,700<br>
-12,500 kg/h. The production window thus increases to approximately factor 4.63.<br><br>
Analogously to the aforesaid, it applies to this case: when the worst-case scenario<br>
is taken into account (approximately 2 minutes start-up requirement up to the actual<br>
start with a minimum required throughput performance), this means for the above<br>
case:<br>
With a standard diverter valve:<br>
2 minutes x 7,500 kg/h = 250 kg material losses, per start-up process.<br>
With a bidirectional diverter valve, this would mean:<br>
2 minutes x 2,700 kg/h = 90 kg material losses, per start-up process.<br>
There is in addition the fact that the same production machine which requires 2<br>
minutes for the manufacture of 7,500 kg, will reach the 2,700 kg/h substantially<br>
faster. This can in turn reduce the start-up time by half, which then means in sum:<br>
43.2 seconds x 2,700 kg/h = 32.4 kg material losses, per start-up process<br>
As documented in this example, this option of the invention therefore opens up a<br>
reduction of the loss quantity per start-up process by a factor 7.72. For the<br>
production facility, this means that, on the one hand, less material loss arises which<br>
then has to be disposed of or treated and, on the other hand, a faster start is<br>
permitted, which means less personnel and less handling overall (plastics have to<br>
be sucked up and cooled on discharge from the diverter valve to the bottom = floor,<br>
which naturally directly influences the operating costs).<br>
For a fully continuous pelletization, this means that a total of €216.12 per week can<br>
be saved with one product change per week and raw material prices of €1.20/kg.<br>
this is an annual savings potential of €13,578.24 p.a.<br>
For a discontinuous pelletization, this means that with only one product change per<br>
day (= 50 tonnes preparation with 20h reaction time and 4h pelletization discharge<br><br>
time) and raw material prices of €1.20/kg, a total of €261.12/day can be saved, this<br>
is an annual savings potential of €95,308.80 p.a.<br>
Even if the use of the diverter valve 1 in an underwater pelletization apparatus is<br>
described above, corresponding advantages can also be achieved with other<br>
pelletizing processes, for instance e.g. with extrusion pelletization or water ring<br>
pelletization, with optionally also the pelletizing heads with the different throughput<br>
capacities being able to use such different pelletizing processes.<br>
The product flows A and B (cf. Figure 20) can differ for the option in the following<br>
application examples:<br>
Both flows each use the same pelletization method (extrusion pelletization/extrusion<br>
pelletization; water ring pelletization/water ring pelletization; underwater<br>
pelletization/underwater pelletization) while using the respectively required nozzle<br>
plates which are either of the same geometry in section and of the same number of<br>
bores or are of the same geometry in section and of a different number of bores or<br>
are of a different geometry in section and of the same number of bores, of are of<br>
different geometry in section or of the same number of bores or have one of the<br>
preceding options, but can be associated with a respectively different construction<br>
size.<br>
Both flows each use a different pelletization process (extrusion pelletization/water<br>
ring pelletization or underwater pelletization; water ring pelletization/extrusion<br>
pelletization or underwater pelletization; underwater pelletization/water ring<br>
pelletization or extrusion pelletization) while using the respectively required nozzle<br>
plates which are either of the same geometry in section and of the same number of<br>
bores or are of the same geometry in section and of a different number of bores or<br>
are of a different geometry in section and of the same number of bores, of are of<br>
different geometry in section or of the same number of bores or have one of the<br>
preceding options, but can be associated with a respectively different construction<br>
size.<br><br>
