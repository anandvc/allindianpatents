				<td>Conditioning of ion exchangers for adsorption of oxoanions<br>
The present invention relates to the use of inorganic salts for increasing the adsorption of oxoanions and/or thioanalogues thereof to metal-doped ion exchangers, preferably to iron oxide/iron oxyhydroxide-containing ion exchangers, preferably from water or aqueous solutions, and also the conditioning of these metal-doped ion exchangers having increased adsorption behaviour toward oxoanions and/or thioanalogues thereof by using inorganic salts with the exception of amphoteric ion exchangers which have both acidic and basic groups as functional groups.<br>
In addition, the invention relates to a process for increasing the thermal stability of metal-doped ion exchangers, preferably iron oxide/iron oxyhydroxide-containing ion exchangers, particularly preferably metal-doped ion exchangers, for the adsorption of oxoanions and/or thioanalogues thereof, with the exception of amphoteric ion exchangers, which contain both acidic and basic groups as functional groups, characterized in that these ion exchangers, subsequently to their production, are conditioned with inorganic salts.<br>
Oxoanions within the meaning the of present invention have the formula XnOm" , XnOm2\ X„Om ", HXnOm" or H2Xn0m2" (where n is an integer 1, 2, 3 or 4, m is an integer 3, 4, 6, 7, or 13, and X is a metal or transition metal of the series Au, Ag, Cu, Si, Cr, Ti, Te, Se, V, As, Sb, W, Mo, U, Os, Nb, Bi, Pb, Co, Ni, Fe, Mn, Ru, Re, Tc, Al, B, or a nonmetal of the series F, CI, Br, I, CN, C, N, P, S. According to the invention, the expression oxoanions preferably means the formulae XOm2", XOm3", HXOm* or H2XOm2", where m is an integer 3 or 4 and X is a metal or transition metal of the series Cr, Te, Se, V, As, Sb, W, Mo, Bi, or a nonmetal of the series CI, Br, I, C, N, P, S. Particularly preferably, according to the invention, the expression oxoanions means oxoanions of arsenic in the oxidation states (III) and (V), of antimony in the oxidation states (III) and (V), of sulphur as sulphate, of phosphorus as phosphate, of chromium as chromate, of bismuth as bismuthate, of molybdenum as molybdate, of vanadium as vanadate, of tungsten as tungstate, of selenium as selenate, of tellurium as tellurate or of chlorine as chlorate or perchlorate. Oxoanions which are particularly preferred according to the invention are H2As03~, H2As04~, HAs042\ As043\ H2Sb03", H2Sb04\ HSb042", Sb043\ Se042", C103\ C104", Bi042", S042", P043\ Chromate. According to the invention, those which are very particularly preferred are the oxoanions H2As03~, H2As04", HAs042", As043" and also Se042" and Chromate. Within the meaning of the present invention, the expression oxoanions in the context of the present disclosure also comprises the thioanalogues, where instead of O in the abovementioned formulae, S represents sulphur.<br><br>
The purity requirements of drinking water have markedly increased in recent decades. Health authorities of numerous countries have developed limiting values for heavy metal concentrations in waters. This relates, in particular, to heavy metals such as arsenic, antimony or chromium.<br>
Under certain conditions, for example arsenic compounds can be extracted from rocks and thus pass into the groundwater. In natural waters, arsenic occurs as an oxidic compound containing trivalent and pentavalent arsenic. In this case it is found that in the pHs prevailing in natural waters the species H3ASO3, H2ASO3", H2As04~, HASO42" principally occur.<br>
In addition to the chromium, antimony and selenium compounds, readily absorbable arsenic compounds are highly toxic and carcinogenic. However, bismuth passing into the groundwater from ore working is also not safe for health.<br>
In many regions of the USA, India, Bangladesh, China and also in South America, in part very high concentrations of arsenic occur in the groundwater.<br>
Numerous medical studies now confirm that people who are exposed to high arsenic pollution over a long period can develop pathological skin changes (hyperkeratosis) and various types of tumour as a result of chronic arsenic poisoning.<br>
Ion exchangers are widely used for purifying raw waters, wastewaters and aqueous process streams. Ion exchangers are also suitable for removing oxoanions, for example arsenate. For instance, R. Kunin and J. Meyers in Journal of American Chemical Society, Volume 69, page 2874 ff. (1947) describe the exchange of anions, such as, for example, arsenate, using ion exchangers which have primary, secondary and tertiary amino groups.<br>
WO 2004/110623 Al and EP-A 1 495 800 describe processes for producing iron oxide/iron oxyhydroxide-containing carboxyl-containing ion exchangers. This material adsorbs arsenic down to low residual concentrations, but is limited in its uptake capacity.<br>
EP-A 1 568 660 discloses a process for removing arsenic from water by contacting the water with a strongly basic anion exchanger which contains a specially defined metal ion or a metal-containing ion. EP-A 1 568 660 refers to the fact that the selectivity towards arsenic increases when secondary and tertiary amino groups are converted to quaternary ammonium groups by alkylation, as a result of which strongly basic anion exchangers are characterized according to EP-A 1 568 660. It is of importance that the salt formed from metal and arsenate has a Ksp no greater than 10"5.<br>
In addition, inter alia a process for removing arsenic(III) or arsenic(V) from water by contacting the water with metal-doped ion exchangers is taught in V. Lenoble et al., Science of the Total<br><br>
Environment 326 (2004) 197-207 using manganese dioxide-doped ion exchangers based on polystyrene, in I. Rao et al., Journal of Radioanalytical and Nuclear Chemistry, Vol. 246, No.3 (2000) 597-600 based on iron(III)-doped chelate resins, and in M. Hruby et al. Collect.Czech. Chem. Commun. Vol. 68, 2003, 2159-2170.<br>
The arsenic adsorbers known from the prior art do not yet exhibit the desired properties with respect to selectivity, capacity and thermal stability. Therefore there is a need for novel ion exchangers or adsorbers in bead form which are specific for oxoanions and/or thioanalogues thereof, in particular oxoanions of arsenic, which are simple to produce, have an improved adsorption of oxoanions and/or thioanalogues thereof, and also display higher thermal stability.<br>
Higher thermal stability of the adsorbers is desirable, since firstly the adsorbers can be stored before use in storage rooms at higher temperatures, or else can come into contact with hot oxoanion-containing water.<br>
The solution of the object and therefore subject matter of the present invention is the use of metal-doped ion exchangers with the exception of amphoteric ion exchangers, which have both acidic and basic functional groups, for adsorption of oxoanions and/or thioanalogues thereof, preferably from water or aqueous solutions, characterized in that, before use, they are subjected to conditioning with an inorganic salt.<br>
In the further course of this application, treatment of a metal-doped ion exchanger with an inorganic salt is termed conditioning.<br>
However, the invention also relates to a process for increasing the adsorption of oxoanions and/or thioanalogues thereof to ion exchangers, characterized in that ion exchangers, with the exception of amphoteric ion exchangers, which contain both acidic and basic functional groups, are conditioned with an inorganic salt after the metal doping. The process is preferably employed in water or aqueous solutions.<br>
In the light of the prior art, it was surprising that inorganic salt-conditioned metal-doped, preferably iron oxide/iron oxyhydroxide-containing ion exchangers, with respect to the prior art, exhibit not only markedly improved oxoanion and thioanion adsorption, but are also generally suitable for use for adsorption of oxoanions and/or thioanalogues thereof, preferably of arsenates, antimonates, phosphates, chromates, molybdates, bismutates, tungstates or selenates, particularly preferably of arsenates or antimonates of the oxidation states (III) and (V) or selenates from aqueous solutions.<br><br>
In a preferred embodiment, the present invention relates to the use of inorganic salt-treated metal-doped ion exchangers in which the metal is selected from the series iron, calcium, magnesium, aluminium, lanthanum, titanium, zinc, nickel, cobalt, manganese, lithium or tin, particularly preferably with said metals whose salt with the oxoanion and/or thioanalogue thereof to be adsorbed has a Ksp no greater than 10~5, in particular preferably iron oxide/iron oxyhydroxide-containing ion exchangers. The metal content of the ion exchanger to be conditioned with inorganic salt is preferably 5 to 30% of the dry weight of the respective ion exchanger.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the invention relates to the use of inorganic salts for increasing the oxoanion and/or thioanalogue thereof adsorption capacity to ion exchangers, with the exception of amphoteric ion exchangers, which have both acidic and basic functional groups, wherein the inorganic salts are salts physiologically harmless for humans, since the preferred use is in treating waters for drinking water provision. According to the invention, for the conditioning, use is preferably made of sodium sulphate, sodium carbonate, sodium phosphate, sodium hydrogenphosphate, sodium chloride, potassium sulphate, potassium carbonate, potassium chloride, potassium phosphate, potassium hydrogenphosphate, particularly preferably sodium chloride. The use of the inorganic salt always proceeds not until after the metal doping of the underlying ion exchanger, with, per ml of ion exchanger, use being made of 0.03 gram of inorganic salt in the form of aqueous solutions, preferably 25% strength by weight solutions.<br>
Conditioning of the respective ion exchanger with the inorganic salt preferably proceeds at temperatures of 5 to 30 degrees Celsius, particularly preferably 10 to 25 degrees Celsius, in particular preferably at room temperature.<br>
Metering in the aqueous solution of the inorganic salt is not critical with respect to time. It can, depending on the technical circumstances, proceed as rapidly as possible.<br>
The ion exchangers can be brought into contact with the aqueous solutions of the inorganic salt with stirring or by filtration in columns.<br>
Per mole of ion exchanger, preferably use is made of 1 to 10 mol, particularly preferably 3 to 6 mol, of inorganic salt.<br>
Preferably, the aqueous solution of the inorganic salt to be used for conditioning has an inorganic salt content of 10 to 40%o by weight, particularly preferably 20 to 30% by weight, and preferably has a pH of 5 to 13, particularly preferably 6 to 11, in particular preferably 7 to 9.<br>
For the conditioning according to the invention with inorganic salt, use is made of metal-doped ion exchangers  which  preferably  have,  as  functional  group,  hydroxide,  ether,  primary amine,<br><br><br>
secondary amine, tertiary amine, quaternary amine, divalent sulphur, amine oxide, phosphonic acid, iminodiacetic acid or hydroxylamine.<br>
The ion exchangers to be used according to the invention for the conditioning with inorganic salt can be either heterodisperse or monodisperse. According to the invention, use is preferably made of monodisperse ion exchangers. Their particle size is generally 250 to 1250 urn, preferably 280 -600 um.<br>
The monodisperse bead polymers underlying the monodisperse ion exchangers can be produced by known processes such as, for example, fractionation, atomization, jetting, or by the seed-feed technique.<br>
The production of monodisperse ion exchangers is known in principle to those skilled in the art. In addition to fractionation of heterodisperse ion exchangers by sieving, a distinction is made between essentially two direct production processes, that is to say atomization or jetting, and the seed-feed process, in the production of the precursors, the monodisperse bead polymers. In the case of the seed-feed process, a monodisperse feed is used which itself can be produced, for example by sieving or by jetting. According to the invention, preferably, for the adsorption of oxoanions, use is made of monodisperse basic ion exchangers obtainable by atomization processes or jetting.<br>
In the present application, those bead polymers or ion exchangers are termed monodisperse in which the uniformity coefficient of the distribution curve is less than or equal to 1.2. The uniformity coefficient is the quotient of the characteristics d60 and dlO. D60 describes the diameter at which 60% by mass in the distribution curve are smaller and 40% by mass are greater or equal. DlO denotes the diameter at which 10% by mass in the distribution curve are smaller and 90% by mass are greater than or equal.<br>
The monodisperse bead polymers, the precursor of the ion exchanger, can be produced, for example, by bringing to reaction monodisperse, if appropriate encapsulated, monomer droplets consisting of a monovinylaromatic compound, a polyvinylaromatic compound, and also an initiator or initiator mixture, and if appropriate a porogen in aqueous suspension. To obtain macroporous bead polymers for producing macroporous ion exchangers, the presence of porogen is absolutely necessary. According to the invention either gel-type or macroporous monodisperse basic ion exchangers can be used. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, monodisperse basic ion exchangers are used, for the production of which use is made of monodisperse bead polymers using microencapsulating monomer droplets. The various production processes of monodisperse bead polymers both by the jetting principle and by the seed-feed principle are known from the<br><br><br>
prior art to those skilled in the art. At this point, reference may be made to US-A 4,444 961, EP-A 0 046 535, US-A 4,419,245 and WO 93/12167.<br>
Monovinylaromatic unsaturated compounds used according to the invention are preferably compounds such as styrene, vinyltoluene, ethylstyrene, alpha-methylstyrene, chlorostyrene or chloromethylstyrene.<br>
Polyvinylaromatic compounds (crosslinkers) preferably used are divinyl-bearing aliphatic or aromatic compounds. Particularly preferably, use is made of divinylbenzene, divinyltoluene, trivinylbenzene, ethylene glycol dimethacrylate, trimethylol propane trimethacrylate, hexa-l,5-diene, octa-l,7-diene, 2,5-dimethyl-l,5-hexadiene and also divinyl ether.<br>
Suitable divinyl ethers are compounds of the general formula (I),<br>
where<br>
R	is a radical of the series CnH2n ,(CmH2m-0)p-CmH2,tl or CH2-C6H4-CH2 and n &gt; 2, m = 2 to 8<br>
and p &gt; 2.<br>
Suitable polyvinyl ethers in the case n &gt; 2 are trivinyl ethers of glycerol, trimethylol propane or tetravinyl ethers of pentaerythritol.<br>
In particular preferably, use is made divinyl ethers of ethylene glycol, di-, tetra- or polyethylene glycol, butanediol or poly-THF or the corresponding tri- or tetravinyl ethers. In particular very particular preference is given to divinyl ethers of butanediol and diethylene glycol such as are described in EP-A 11 10 608.<br>
The macroporous property which is desired as an alternative to the gel-type property is already given to the ion exchangers in the synthesis of their precursors, the bead polymers. The addition of what is termed porogen is absolutely necessary for this. The connection of ion exchangers and their macroporous structure is described in German Auslegeschrift (German published specification) DE 1045102 (1957) and in German Auslegeschrift DE 1113570 (1957). As porogen for the production of macroporous bead polymers to be used according to the invention in order to obtain macroporous basic ion exchangers, especially organic substances are suitable which dissolve in the monomer but which dissolve or swell the polymer poorly. Those which may be mentioned by way of examples are aliphatic hydrocarbons such as octane, isooctane, decane,<br><br><br>
isododecane. In addition compounds which are readily suitable are alcohols having 4 to 10 carbon atoms, such as butanol, hexanol or octanol.<br>
In addition to the monodisperse gel-type ion exchangers, according to the invention, preferably, therefore, use may be made of monodisperse ion exchangers having a macroporous structure for the adsorption of oxoanions and/or thioanalogues thereof. The expression "macroporous" is known to those skilled in the art. Details are described, for example, in J.R. Millar et al J.Chem.Soc.1963, 218. The macroporous ion exchangers have a pore volume determined by mercury porosimetry of 0.1 to 2.2 ml/g, preferably from 0.4 to 1.8 ml/g.<br>
Functionalization of the bead polymers obtainable by the prior art to give monodisperse ion exchangers having the abovementioned preferred functional groups is likewise substantially known from the prior art to those skilled in the art. Examples of such functionalized ion exchangers are mentioned in DE-A 10200601737, the contents of which are hereby incorporated in their entirety by reference in the present application.<br>
DE-A 10200601737 describes herein a process for producing monodisperse macroporous basic ion exchangers having weakly basic, medium-basic or strongly basic groups by what is termed the phthalimide process, by<br>
a)	reacting monomer droplets of at least one monovinylaromatic compound and at least one polyvinylaromatic compound and also a porogen and an initiator or an initiator combination to give a monodisperse crosslinked bead polymer,<br>
b)	amidomethylating this monodisperse crosslinked bead polymer with phthalimide derivatives,<br>
c)	reacting the amidomethylated bead polymer to give a basic ion exchanger having aminomethyl groups and<br>
d)	reacting the basic ion exchanger by alkylation to give weakly basic to strongly basic anion exchangers having secondary and/or tertiary and/or quaternary amino groups.<br>
According to the invention, for the adsorption of oxoanions and/or thioanalogues thereof from aqueous solutions, preference is given to metal-doped monodisperse ion exchangers produced by the phthalimide process and conditioned with inorganic salt. Their degree of substitution is up to 1.6, that is to say per aromatic ring, on a statistical average up to 1.6 hydrogen atoms are substituted by CH2NH2 groups. Therefore, using the phthalimide process, high-capacity, crosslinking-free basic ion exchangers can be produced which are outstandingly suitable, after conversion to metal-doped, preferably iron oxide/iron oxyhydroxide-containing ion exchangers,<br><br><br>
and after conditioning thereof with inorganic salt, for the adsorption of oxoanions and/or thioanalogues thereof, preferably arsenates, antimonates or selenates and/or thioanalogues thereof and contain primary and/or secondary and/or tertiary amino groups or quaternary ammonium groups.<br>
The doping of the ion exchangers to give a metal-doped ion exchanger, which is to be performed before conditioning with inorganic salt, proceeds using corresponding salts of any metal. In the prior art cited at the outset, corresponding metal salts to give the respective metals are mentioned.<br>
In the case of the iron-doped ion exchangers which are preferably according to the invention to be conditioned with inorganic salt, the doping proceeds before conditioning with iron(II) salts or iron(III) salts, preferably with a non-complex-forming iron(II) salt or iron(III)salt. Iron(III) salts which can be used for this are soluble iron(III) salts, preferably iron(III) chloride, iron(III) sulphate or iron(III) nitrate.<br>
As iron(II) salts, use can be made of all soluble iron(II) salts, in particular, use is made of iron(II) chloride, sulphate, nitrate. Preferably, the oxidation of the iron(II) salts in suspension in process step a) proceeds by air.<br>
For the preferred doping with iron, the ion exchangers can be brought into contact with the iron salt solutions with stirring or by filtration in columns. Per mole of iron salt used, in this case, use is made of 1 to lOmol, preferably 3 to 6 mol, of alkali metal hydroxide or alkaline earth metal hydroxide. Per mole of functional group in the ion exchanger, use is made of 0.05 to 3 mol, preferably 0.2 to 1.2 mol, of iron salt. The pH in the doping step is adjusted using alkali metal hydroxides or alkaline earth metal hydroxides, in particular potassium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide or calcium hydroxide, alkali metal carbonates or alkaline earth metal carbonates or hydrogen carbonates. The pH range in which the doping proceeds, that is the formation of iron oxide/iron oxyhydroxide groups, is in the range between 2 and 12, preferably 3 and 9. The substances to be used in this case are preferably used as aqueous solutions. The concentration of the aqueous alkali metal hydroxide or alkaline earth metal hydroxide solutions can be up to 50% by weight. Preferably, use is made of aqueous solutions having an alkali metal hydroxide or alkaline earth metal hydroxide concentration in the range 20 to 40% by weight. The speed of the metering of the aqueous solutions of alkali metal hydroxide or alkaline earth metal hydroxide is dependent on the level of the desired pH and the technical circumstances. For example, 120 minutes are required for this. After reaching the desired pH, stirring is continued for 1 to 10 hours, preferably 2 to 4 hours. The metering of the aqueous solutions of alkali metal hydroxide or alkaline earth metal hydroxide proceeds at temperatures between 10 and 90°C, preferably at 30 to 60°C.<br><br><br>
It has proven useful for the synthesis of iron oxide/iron oxyhydroxide-containing ion exchangers preferably to make use of NaOH or KOH as base. However, any other base can be used which<br>
leads to the formation of FeOH groups, such as, for example, NH4OH, Na2C03, CaO, Mg(OH)2<br>
O etc. Generally in the same manner doping with «thers of the above listed metals Ca, Mg, Al, La, Ti,<br>
Zu, Ni, Co, Mn, Li or Sn will take place.<br>
After the conditioning with inorganic salt, the finally conditioned metal-doped ion exchanger is isolated. Isolation within the meaning of the present invention means separating off the ion exchanger from the aqueous solution of the inorganic salt and purifying the finally conditioned ion exchanger. The separation proceeds by measures known to those skilled in the art such as decanting, centrifugation, filtration. The purification proceeds by washing with, for example, deionized water and can comprise a classification for separating off fine fractions or coarse fractions. If appropriate, the metal-doped ion exchangers conditioned with inorganic salt can be dried, preferably at reduced pressure and/or particularly preferably at temperatures between 20°C and 120°C.<br>
Surprisingly, the ion exchangers conditioned according to the invention with inorganic salt adsorb oxoanions and/or thioanalogues thereof, for example of arsenic, not only in its most oxidation forms, but also, in addition, additionally oxianions and/or thioanalogues of heavy metals such as, preferably oxoanions and/or thioanalogues of chrome, cobalt, nickel, lead, zinc, cadmium, copper. As already described above, the ion exchangers conditioned with inorganic salt to be used according to the invention are equally capable of ion exchange of HAs042" and H2As04~ isostructural ions such as, for example, dihydrogenphosphates, vanadates, molybdates, tungstates, antimonates, bismuthates, selenates or chromates. The ion exchangers conditioned according to the invention within inorganic salt are suitable, in particular, preferably for the adsorption of the species H2As03", H2As04\ HAsC-42", As043~, H2Sb03", H2Sb04", HSb042", Sb043", Se042The metal-doped ion exchangers conditioned according to the invention with inorganic salt, preferably the iron oxide/iron oxyhydroxide-containing conditioned ion exchangers, can preferably be used for purifying waters containing oxoanions and thioanalogues thereof or aqueous solutions of any type. Particularly preferably, they are used for purifying drinking water, wastewater streams of the chemical industry or of refuse incineration plants, and also of mine drainage waters or leachate waters of landfills.<br>
The metal-doped ion exchangers conditioned with inorganic salt to be used according to the invention, preferably the iron oxide/iron oxyhydroxide-containing conditioned ion exchangers of the invention, are preferably used in devices suitable for their tasks.<br><br><br>
The invention therefore also relates to devices through which a liquid to be treated can flow, preferably filtration units, particularly preferably adsorption vessels, in particular filter adsorption vessels, filled with metal-doped ion exchangers, preferably with iron oxide/iron oxyhydroxide-containing ion exchangers obtainable by the process described in this application, for removing oxoanions and/or thioanalogues thereof, preferably for removing oxoanions of arsenic, antimony or selenium, in particular of arsenic, from aqueous media or gases, preferably drinking water. The devices can be connected, for example, in the home, to the public sanitary system or the public drinking water supply.<br>
Methods of analysis<br>
Determination of the uptake capacity for arsenic in the oxidation state V:<br>
For measurement of the adsorption of arsenic(V), 250 ml of an aqueous solution of Na2HAs04 containing an amount of As(V) of 2800 ppb are set to a pH of 8.5 and shaken with 0.3 ml of arsenic adsorber for 24 hours in a 300 ml of polyethylene flask. After 24 hours, the residual amount of arsenic(V) in the supernatant solution is analysed.<br>
Determination of the thermal stability of oxoanion adsorbers<br>
50 ml of deionized water are charged into a 300 ml ground glass joint flask. To this are added 50 ml of oxoanion adsorber at room temperature. The glass flask is then kept in a drying cabinet for 5 days at 70°C. Thereafter the suspension is charged into a column, the liquid phase flows out, and the adsorber is washed from the top with 100 ml of deionized water. Subsequently its uptake capacity for arsenic is determined by the abovementioned measurement method - determination of the uptake capacity for arsenic in oxidation state V.<br>
Determination of the amount of basic aminomethyl groups in the aminomethylated crosslinked polystyrene bead polymer<br>
100 ml of the aminomethylated bead polymer are jolted on the jolting volumeter and subsequently flushed into a glass column with deionized water. In 1 hour and 40 minutes, 1000 ml of 2% strength by weight sodium hydroxide solution are filtered through. Subsequently, deionized water is filtered through until 100 ml of eluate admixed with phenolphthalein have a consumption of 0.1 n (0.1 normal) hydrochloric acid of at most 0.05 ml.<br><br><br>
50 ml of this resin are admixed in a glass beaker with 50 ml of deionized water and 100 ml of 1 n hydrochloric acid. The suspension is stirred for 30 minutes and subsequently charged into a glass column. The liquid is drained off. A further 100 ml of 1 n hydrochloric acid is filtered through the resin in 20 minutes. Subsequently, 200 ml of methanol are filtered through. All eluates are collected and combined and titrated with 1 n sodium hydroxide solution against methyl orange.<br>
The amount of aminomethyl groups in 1 litre of aminomethylated resin is calculated from the following formula: ( 200 - V ) • 20 = mole of aminomethyl groups per litre of resin, where V is the volume of 1 n sodium hydroxide solution consumed in the titration.<br>
Determination of the degree of substitution of the aromatic rings of the crosslinked bead polymer by aminomethyl groups<br>
The amount of aminomethyl groups in the total amount of the aminomethylated resin is determined by the above method.<br>
From the amount of bead polymer used, A in grams, by division by the molecular weight, the molar amount of aromatics present in this amount is calculated.<br>
For example, from 300 gram of bead polymer, 950 ml of aminomethylated bead polymer containing an amount of 1.8 mol/1 of aminoethyl groups are produced.<br>
950 ml of aminomethylated bead polymer contain 2.82 mol of aromatics.<br>
Per aromatic, then, 1.8/2.81 = 0.64 mol of aminomethyl groups are present.<br>
The degree of substitution of the aromatic rings of the crosslinked bead polymer by aminomethyl groups is 0.64.<br>
Number of perfect beads after production<br>
100 beads are viewed under the microscope. The number of beads which have cracks or show splintering is determined. The number of perfect beads results from the difference between the number of damaged beads and 100.<br>
Determination of the stability of the resin by the roller test<br>
The bead polymer under test is distributed in uniform layer thickness between two plastic cloths. The cloths are placed on a solid horizontal support and subjected to 20 working cycles in a roller apparatus. One working cycle consists of rolling carried out forwards and backwards. After rolling,<br><br>
the number of undamaged beads is determined on representative samples of 100 beads by enumeration under the microscope.<br>
Swelling stability test<br>
25 ml of anion exchanger in the chloride form are charged into a column. 4% strength by weight aqueous sodium hydroxide solution, deionized water, 6% strength by weight hydrochloric acid and again deionized water are placed successively into the column, the sodium hydroxide solution and the hydrochloric acid flowing through the resin from the top and the deionized water being pumped through the resin from the bottom. The treatment proceeds under time control via a control apparatus. One working cycle lasts for 1 h. 20 working cycles are carried out. After the end of the working cycles, 100 beads are enumerated from the resin sample. The number of perfect beads which are not damaged by cracks or fractures is determined.<br>
Determination of the amount of weakly or strongly basic groups in anion exchangers<br>
100 ml of anion exchanger in a glass column are charged with 1000 ml of 2% strength by weight sodium hydroxide solution in 1 hour and 40 minutes. Subsequently the resin is washed with deionized water to remove the excess sodium hydroxide solution.<br>
Determination of the NaCl number<br>
50 ml of the exchanger in the free base form and washed to neutrality are placed into a column and charged with 950 ml of 2.5% strength by weight aqueous sodium chloride solution. The effluent is collected, made up to 1 litre with deionized water and of this 50 ml are titrated with 0.1 n hydrochloric acid. The resin is washed with deionized water.<br>
Consumed ml 0.1 n hydrochloric acid x 4/100 = NaCl number in mole/litre resin.<br>
Determination of the NaN03 number<br>
Then, 950 ml of 2.5% strength by weight sodium nitrate solution are filtered through. The effluent is made up to 1000 ml with deionized water. Of this an aliquot, 10 ml, is taken off and analysed for its chloride content by titration with mercury nitrate solution.<br>
Determination of the HC1 number<br>
The resin is washed with deionized water and flushed into a glass beaker. It is admixed with 100 ml of 1 n hydrochloric acid and allowed to stand for 30 minutes. The entire suspension is flushed into a glass column. A further 100 ml of hydrochloric acid are filtered through the resin.<br><br>
The resin is washed with methanol. The effluent is made up to 1000 ml with deionized water. Of this 50 ml are titrated with 1 n sodium hydroxide solution.<br>
(20 - consumed ml of 1 n sodium hydroxide solution)/5 = HCl number in mole/litre of resin.<br>
The amount of strongly basic groups is equal to the sum of NaN03 number and HCl number.<br>
The amount of weakly basic groups is equal to the HCl number.<br><br>
