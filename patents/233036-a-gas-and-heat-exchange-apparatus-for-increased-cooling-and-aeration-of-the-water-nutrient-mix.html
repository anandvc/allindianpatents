				<td>AN AIR AND HEAT EXCHANGE APPARATUS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a gas and heat exchange apparatus<br>
for use with a hydroponic growth system and in particular to one which increases<br>
the cooling and aeration of the water/nutrient mix whilst decreasing the loss of<br>
liquid due to evaporation.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
In hydroponics, water/nutrients are generally kept in a large storage<br>
tank and recycled. This liquid is often heated through conduction or thermal<br>
heating by the sun. It must therefore generally be cooled before it can be applied<br>
to the plants. Also generally there can be a build up of noxious gases within the<br>
storage tank. If the storage tank is sealed, then those gases may be forced into<br>
solution This gas may be deleterious to the plant life if absorbed.<br>
Heat exchange apparatus, in general, are well known, In industrial<br>
processes, heat energy is transferred by a variety of methods, including<br>
conduction in electric-resistance heaters; conduction-convection in exchanges,<br>
dwellers, and condensers; radiation in furnaces and radiant-heat dryers, and by<br>
special methods such as dielectric heating.<br>
The design and testing of practical heat-exchange equipment are<br>
based on the general principles of heat transfer. In simple devices, the vital<br>
quantities such as average temperature difference and heat transfer coefficient<br>
can often be evaluated easily and with considerable accuracy, but in complex<br>
processing units evaluation may be difficult and subject to considerable<br>
uncertainty. The final design of heat exchange equipment is nearly always a<br>
compromise, based on engineering judgment, to give the best overall<br>
performance in the light of service requirements.<br>
Sometimes the design is governed by considerations which have<br>
little to do with heat transfer, such as the space available for the equipment or the<br>
pressure drop which can be tolerated in the fluid streams,<br>
Heat exchangers are so important and so widely used in the<br>
process 01 chemical industries that the principles of their design have been highly<br>
developed. Standards devised and accepted by the Tubular Exchanger<br>
Manufacturers Association (T. E. M. A.) are available covering in detail areas<br>
such as materials, methods of construction, technique of design, and dimensions<br>
for exchangers. Most exchangers are liquid to liquid heat exchangers, but gases<br>
and non-condensing vapours can also be treated in them.<br>
Already known are tubular type exchangers, and also plate type<br>
exchangers. A tubular type exchanger generally has a first fluid flowing in tubes<br>
inside a larger fluid tight shell. A second fluid flows in the shell, outside the tubes,<br>
either cooling or heating the fluid flowing in the tubes. This heating or cooling is<br>
generally accomplished mainly by conduction from the hot fluid to the cooler fluid<br>
through the tube wall.<br>
In plate type exchangers, metal plates, usually with corrugated<br>
faces, are supported in a frame; hot fluid passes between alternate pairs of<br>
plates, exchanging heat with the cold fluid in the adjacent spaces. The plates are<br>
typically approximately 5 mm apart. They can be readily separated for cleaning;<br>
additional area may be provided simply by adding more plates.<br>
Other, more practical or readily available methods of heating or<br>
cooling are also known. One such method of heating is thermal heating. In this<br>
type of heating, fluids are stored in vessels, and the vessel is exposed to the sun<br>
The heat energy from the sun heats the liquid inside the vessel.<br>
Methods of cooling, similar in principle to thermal healing are also<br>
known. A simple example of evaporative cooling is known, particularly in off-road<br>
and long-distance trucking. In this method of cooling, a storage vessel is<br>
surrounded by cloth, the entire vessel and cloth then submerged in water, and<br>
attached to the front of a moving vehicle. Due to the speed of the moving vehicle<br>
and the air passing by the storage vessel, now surrounded with wet cloth,<br>
evaporation takes place. Due to the fact that evaporation requires heat energy to<br>
heat the water above a particular temperature, heat is absorbed from the water<br>
inside the storage vessel, thus cooling it.<br>
The above methods of cooling and heating are not generally<br>
appropriate for small-scale hydroponics operations. Tubular type exchangers<br>
and plate type exchangers are very expensive and require large amounts of<br>
maintenance. For these reasons, they are often only found in large chemical<br>
plants. They are highly complex pieces of equipment and as such are not<br>
serviced easily by untrained operators. They require special knowledge and<br>
training which is not generally available to an ordinary user. They are generally<br>
suited only for large throughput situations<br>
Methods of the gas exchange are also known. Particularly mass-<br>
transfer operations known as gas absorption and stripping, or desorption are<br>
known.<br>
In the gas absorption, a soluble vapour is absorbed from its mixture<br>
with an inert gas using a liquid in which the sought after gas is more or less<br>
soluble. The washing of ammonia from a mixture of ammonia and air by means<br>
of liquid water is a typical example. The solute gas is subsequently recovered<br>
from the liquid by distillation, and the absorbing liquid can either be discarded or<br>
reused. Sometimes a solute is removed from a liquid by bringing the liquid into<br>
contact with an inert gas, such an operation, the reverse of gas absorption, is<br>
called desorption or gas stripping.<br>
The methods of gas exchange have disadvantages which are similar to the<br>
heat exchanger situation They require special skills and training for operation of<br>
the required equipment and as such are not used by users without such training.<br>
They also are expensive pieces of equipment which are often quite large and<br>
complex and therefore are out of the budget of smaller users.<br>
It simply would not be economically viable, nor practical, to use a<br>
conventional heal or gas exchanger, in a relatively small business such as a<br>
hydroponic primary producer. Often these large-scale pieces of equipment have<br>
their own problems, and as such would not meet the needs of a hydroponic<br>
grower<br>
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed to a gas and heat exchange<br>
apparatus, which may at least partially overcome the abovementioned<br>
disadvantages or provide the consumer with a useful or commercial choice,<br>
In one form, the invention resides in a gas and heat exchange<br>
apparatus, which has at least one substantially vertical elongate hollow member,<br>
a plurality of internal members spaced inside the at least one hollow member,<br>
each internal member having at least one opening, means for gas intake and<br>
exhaust in fluid connection with the at least one hollow member, means for<br>
draining the at least one hollow member and a means for adding liquid to the<br>
upper end of the at least one hollow member.<br>
Preferably the internal members comprise insert members. Suitably<br>
the edges of each insert member are In substantially fluid tight connection with<br>
the internal surface of the at least one hollow member in which they are located.<br>
There may preferably be three substantially vertical elongate hollow<br>
members making up each apparatus. Each of the three hollow members will<br>
preferably be the same, merely allowing more fluid to be treated than a single<br>
hollow member.<br>
The hollow members may preferably be connected by connecting<br>
members disposed at each end of the hollow members. The connecting<br>
members may preferably be adapted to join the three hollow members to each<br>
other in a substantially fluid tight manner.<br>
The hollow members will preferably be tubular members. The outer<br>
diameter of each hollow member will preferably be between 50 and 300 mm<br>
The hollow members will preferably be manufactured from a rigid, strong but light<br>
material. A preferred material would be polyvinyl chloride (PVC) or plastic<br>
The connecting member at the upper end of the hollow members<br>
will preferably have an elbow joint at each end of the connecting member end<br>
also a third, T-shaped joint between the elbow joints, Each elbow joint will<br>
preferably be attached to the first and second hollow members respectively and<br>
the downcomer of the T-shaped joint will be attached to the third hollow member.<br>
Each elbow joint will preferably be connected to either side of the crosspiece of<br>
the T-shaped member via a length of connecting member.<br>
The connecting member at the lower end of the hollow members will<br>
also preferably have an elbow joint at each end of the connecting member and<br>
also a third, T-shaped joint between the elbow joints. The connecting member of<br>
the upper end and the connecting member of the lower end of the hollow<br>
members will preferably be substantially similar in design.<br>
The wall thickness of the hollow members and the connecting members<br>
will preferably be the same. It will preferably be between 1 mm and 25 mm This<br>
wall thickness may be important in maintaining the vertical strength of the hollow<br>
members, and also the heat flux through the wall of the hollow members<br>
The length of the hollow members will preferably be between 15m<br>
and 10 m. In order to maintain the vertical strength of the hollow members, they<br>
will suitably be approximately 6.S to 7 m long. This will provide suitable length in<br>
which to accomplish the gas and heat exchange, but be short enough to maintain<br>
strength<br>
There may also preferably be a second member, disposed inside<br>
the substantially vertical hollow member, to provide support. The second<br>
member will preferably also be an elongate hollow member, and also preferably<br>
be constructed of the same material as the hollow members. It will suitably be of<br>
a smaller diameter, and be fixed within the hollow member in a concentric<br>
manner. The second member will preferably be of equal length to the hollow<br>
member, and terminate at both ends in a plane common with the hollow member.<br>
The second member shall preferably be spaced from the hollow<br>
member and held in position by the insert members. The second member shall<br>
be disposed substantially in the centre of the hollow member, so as to define an<br>
annular portion between the hollow member and the second member. It is in this<br>
annular portion that the heat and gas exchange will preferably take place. The<br>
ends of the second member will preferably be sealed in a substantially fluid tight<br>
manner to prevent any fluid flowing into the second member. This will force the<br>
fluid to flow preferably through the annular portion.<br>
The orientation of the substantially vertical elongate hollow<br>
members when erected will preferably be to avoid all of the members being<br>
exposed to the sun at once. This means that the general orientation will be<br>
parallel to the East-West movement of the sun.<br>
The hollow members will preferably be maintained in their<br>
substantially vertical orientation by a support frame attached to the hollow<br>
members. This support frame will preferably be manufactured out of a light metal<br>
such as steel. The support frame will preferably hold the hollow members above<br>
the ground, at a suitable height to engage with other hydroponic apparatus.<br>
Preferably the lowest portion of the hollow members will be held approximately at<br>
1-2 m above the ground surface. The support frame will preferably be strong<br>
enough to maintain the vertical position of the hollow members even during<br>
violent storms.<br>
The insert members will preferably be disk shaped members. They<br>
will preferably be planar and circular, matching the shape of the hollow members<br>
inside which they are located. The insert members wilt preferably have a central<br>
hole, which matches the outer diameter of the second member located inside the<br>
hollow member. The central hole will preferably engage with the second member<br>
and the insert members will be supported by the second member.<br>
The Insert members typically have an inner edge defined by the<br>
central hole, and an outer edge. The inner edge of each insert member will<br>
preferably be attached to the second member. The outer edge of each insert<br>
member will preferably be attached to the hollow member in which they are<br>
located. These attachments will preferably be in a substantially fluid tight manner<br>
to prevent any fluid flowing through these attachments. The method of<br>
attachment may be any conventional method, including adhesive means or collar<br>
means.<br>
The insert members will suitably be separated vertically. The insert<br>
members will preferably be separated by an equal spacing. The separation shall<br>
preferably be accomplished by the method of attachment to the second member<br>
The insert members will be held in their position by the method of attachment to<br>
the second member.<br>
Preferably, there shall be at least three different types of insert<br>
member. The first type of Insert member will be located at the upper and lower<br>
extremities of each hollow membei. There shall preferably be one of the first<br>
type of insert member located at each of the upper and lower extremities of the<br>
hollow member. The first type of insert member will preferably be circular, have a<br>
central hole which is of a diameter to engage with the second member, and have<br>
a plurality of openings on its circular surface. The openings will preferably be<br>
holes to allow the flow of fluid through the insert member. The first type of insert<br>
member shall preferably provide an even distribution of fluid around the diameter<br>
of the hollow member.<br>
The second type of insert member will preferably be located<br>
adjacent the upper first type of insert member. There shall preferably be 9 of the<br>
second type of insert member arrayed adjacent the upper first type of insert<br>
member The second type of insert member will be circular, have a central hole<br>
which is of a diameter to engage with the second member, and have a plurality of<br>
openings on its circular surface. The openings will preferably be holes to allow<br>
the flow of fluid through the insert member. The plurality of openings shall<br>
preferably be of two different sizes. The first sized opening in the second type of<br>
insert member will preferably be approximately 40 mm in diameter. The second<br>
sized opening in the second type of insert member will preferably be<br>
approximately 15 mm in diameter. The two different sized openings will be<br>
alternated around the circular surface of the insert member.<br>
The second type of insert member will preferably be covered by<br>
mesh member. The mesh member will preferably have openings which are<br>
approximately 1 mm square, but may be of any size and/or shape. The mesh<br>
member may preferably be constructed of "fly screen" mesh. This mesh member<br>
will be preferably attached to the second type of insert member to both its upper<br>
and lower circular surface. The mesh member will preferably assist the gas<br>
exchange.<br>
The third type of insert member will be located adjacent the lowest<br>
second type of insert member, but above the lower insert member of the first<br>
type. There shall preferably be 3 of the third type of insert member arrayed<br>
adjacent the lowest second type of insert member. The third type of insert<br>
member will be circular, have a central hole which is of a diameter to engage with<br>
the second member, and have a plurality of openings on its circular surface. The<br>
openings will preferably be holes to allow the flow of fluid through the insert<br>
member. The plurality of openings shall preferably be of two different sizes. The<br>
first sized opening in the third type of insert member will preferably be<br>
approximately 40 mm in diameter. The second sized opening in the third type of<br>
insert member will preferably be approximately 20 mm in diameter. The two<br>
different sized openings will be alternated around the circular surface of the insert<br>
member.<br>
The third type of insert member will preferably be covered by a<br>
mesh member The mesh member will preferably have openings which are<br>
smaller than 1 mm square. The mesh member may preferably be constructed of<br>
"sailing cloth" mesh. This mesh member will be preferably attached to the third<br>
type of insert member to both its upper and lower circular surface. The weave of<br>
the mesh member attached to the third type of insert member will preferably be<br>
much smaller than the weave of the mesh member attached to the second type<br>
of insert member. The mesh member will preferably further assist the gas<br>
exchange.<br>
The insert members will alt preferably be fixed to the hollow member<br>
such that the openings on the insert members are not aligned. This will suitably<br>
ensure that the fluid flowing through the hollow member does not have a fixed<br>
flow path, this wilt preferably provide a degree of agitation to the fluid.<br>
The insert members are preferably constructed of a rigid yet strong<br>
material Preferably the material will also be light, and as such a material such as<br>
polyvinyl chloride (PVC) or other plastic is preferred<br>
The means for gas intake and exhaust will preferably be T-shaped.<br>
The vertical portion of the T-shaped means is preferably attached to the<br>
connecting member at the upper end of the hollow members This will suitably<br>
position the means for gas intake and exhaust approximately 8 m above ground<br>
level.<br>
The crosspiece of the T-shaped means will preferably have elbow<br>
joints on either end. The perpendicular portion of the elbow joints will preferably<br>
extend downward. At the lower extremity of the perpendicular portion, there shall<br>
preferably be a mesh cap member. The mesh cap member will preferably be<br>
dome shaped. There will preferably be more than one T-shaped means<br>
connected to the connecting member at the upper end of the hollow members.<br>
The means for gas intake and exhaust will preferably be<br>
manufactured from polyvinyl chloride (PVC) or other plastic pipe. The diameter of<br>
the members comprising the means for gas intake and exhaust will preferably be<br>
smaller than that of the hollow members.<br>
The means for gas intake and exhaust will preferably be in fluid<br>
contact with the connecting member al the upper end of the hollow members,<br>
and therefore also be in fluid contact with the hollow members themselves. This<br>
will preferably allow the flow of gases, particularly air, into and out of the hollow<br>
members.<br>
The connection of the means for gas intake and exhaust to the<br>
connecting member at the upper end of the hollow members will preferably be<br>
such that the orientation of the means for gas intake and exhaust with respect to<br>
the hollow members may be changed. Preferably the means for gas intake and<br>
exhaust may be located above the hollow members, they may also be arrayed on<br>
an angle to the hollow members. The means for gas Intake and exhaust are<br>
preferably located to avoid the intake of ground level heat and dust.<br>
The means for draining the hollow member will preferably be a hole<br>
in the connecting member at the lower end of the hollow members. This hole will<br>
preferably be in substantially fluid tight connection with an elongate tubular<br>
member leading to a storage tank or to a hydroponlc apparatus. Preferably the<br>
hole will be disposed towards the underside of the connecting member to allow<br>
draining of the hollow member under the force of gravity.<br>
The means for adding liquid to the upper end of the hollow<br>
members will preferably be a system of pipes leading from a storage tank or from<br>
a hydroponic apparatus. This will allow the collection and recycling of any<br>
water/nutrient added to the hollow members. The pipes will preferably be<br>
constructed or polyvinyl chloride (PVC) or plastic The system of pipes will<br>
preferably be operatively associated with a pump means, to pump the<br>
water/nutrient from the storage tank or hydroponic apparatus to the upper end of<br>
the hollow members. At this point gravity will preferably take over and act to draw<br>
the liquid down through the hollow members to the means for draining the hollow<br>
members.<br>
The system of pipes will preferably be attached to the outside of the<br>
hollow members. There will preferably be only one pipe carrying water/nutrient to<br>
the upper end of the hollow members. At the upper end of the carrying pipe, will<br>
be a T-shaped joint which will allow splitting of the flow of water/nutrient into<br>
separate streams, each stream entering one of the hollow members and the<br>
liquid may flow downward towards the means for draining the hollow members.<br>
The water/nutrient will preferably enter the hollow members through<br>
substantially fluid tight openings in the connecting member at the upper end of<br>
the hollow members The fluid will then flow directly onto the first type of insert<br>
member which will have the effect of dispersing the fluid evenly about the annular<br>
portion of each of the hollow members.<br>
Due to the pressure effect of pumping the water/nutrient into the<br>
upper end of the hollow members, air will be drawn from outside the hollow<br>
members, through the gas intake and exhaust means, into the hollow members.<br>
This air will then be mixed with the water/nutrient as it travels downward through<br>
the hollow members. Mass transfer may also occur about any of the insert<br>
members, or in the hollow member in general.<br><br>

BEST MODE<br>
According to the embodiment depicted herein, the invention resides<br>
in a gas and heat exchange apparatus 10, which has at least one substantially<br>
vertical elongate hollow member 11, a plurality of insert members 12 spaced<br>
vertically inside the hollow member 11. the edges of each insert member 12<br>
being in substantially fluid tight connection with the internal surface of the hollow<br>
member 11, each insert member 12 having a plurality of openings 13, means for<br>
gas intake and exhaust 14 in fluid connection with the hollow member 11, means<br>
for draining the elongate hollow member 15 and a means for adding liquid 16 to<br>
the upper end of the hollow member.<br>
I here are three substantially vertical elongate hollow members 11<br>
making up each apparatus 10. Each of the three hollow members 11 is the<br>
same, both internally and externally, allowing more fluid to be treated than that<br>
possible by a single hollow member 11.<br>
The hollow members 11 are connected by connecting members 17<br>
disposed at each end of the hollow members 11. The connecting members 17<br>
are adapted to pin the three hollow members 11 in a substantially fluid tight<br>
manner to each other.<br>
The hollow members 11 are elongate tubular members The inner<br>
diameter of each hollow member 11 is approximately 150 mm. The hollow<br>
members 11 are manufactured from polyvinyl chioride (PVC) or plastic<br>
The connecting member at the upper end of the hollow members 18<br>
has an elbow joint 19 at each end of the connecting member 18 and also a third,<br>
T-shaped joint 20 between the elbow joints 19. Each elbow joint 19 Is attached to<br>
the first and second hollow members 11, and the downcomer of the T-shaped<br>
joint 21, will be attached to the third hollow member 11. Each elbow joint 19 is<br>
connected to either side of the crosspiece of the T-shaped member via a length<br>
of connecting member 17.<br>
The connecting member at the lower end of the hollow members 22<br>
also has an elbow joint at each end of the connecting member 22 and also a<br>
third. T-shaped joint between the elbow joints. The connecting member of the<br>
upper end 18 and the connecting member of the lower end 22 of the hollow<br>
members 11 are substantially similar in design.<br>
The wall thickness of the hollow members 11 and the connecting<br>
members 17 is the same It is approximately 9 5 mm. This wall thickness is<br>
Important to maintain the vertical strength of the hollow members 11.<br>
The length of the hollow members 11 is approximately 6 m in order<br>
to maintain the vertical strength of the hollow members 11. This will provide<br>
suitable length in which to accomplish the gas and heat exchange, but be short<br>
enough to maintain strength.<br>
There is also a second member 23, disposed inside each<br>
substantially vertical hollow member 11, to provide support. The second member<br>
23 is also an elongate hollow member, and is also constructed of the same<br>
material as the hollow members 11. It is of a smaller diameter, and fixed within<br>
the hollow member 11 in a concentric manner. The second member 23 is of<br>
equal length to the hollow member 11, and terminates at both ends in a plane<br>
common with the hollow member 11.<br>
The second member 23 is spaced from the hollow member 11 and<br>
held in position by the insert members 12. The second member 23 is disposed<br>
substantially in the centre of the hollow member 11, so as to define an annular<br>
portion 24 It is in this annular portion 24 that the heat and gas exchange will<br>
take place. The ends of the second member 23 will preferably be sealed in a<br>
substantially fluid tight manner to prevent any fluid flowing into the second<br>
member 23. This will force the fluid to flow through the annular portion 24,<br>
The orientation of the substantially vertical elongate hollow<br>
members 11 will be to avoid aR of the members being exposed to the sun at<br>
once. This means that the general orientation will be parallel to the East-West<br>
movement of the sun.<br>
The hollow members 11 are maintained in their substantially vertical<br>
orientation by a support frame attached to the hollow members 11. This support<br>
frame will be manufactured out of a light metal such as steel. The support frame<br>
holds the hollow members 11 above the ground, at a suitable height to engage<br>
with other hydroponic apparatus. Generally, the lowest portion of the hollow<br>
members will be held approximately at 1-1.5 m above the ground surface. The<br>
support frame will preferably be strong enough to maintain the vertical position of<br>
the hollow members 11 even during violent storms.<br>
The insert members 12 are disk shaped members. They are planar,<br>
circular members matching the shape of the hollow members 11 inside which<br>
they are located. The insert members 12 have a central hole 25, which matches<br>
the outer diameter of the second member 23 located inside the hollow member<br>
11. The central hole 25 engages with the second member 23 and the insert<br>
members 12 will be supported by the second member 23.<br>
The insert members 12 have an inner edge 26 defined by the<br>
central hole 25, and an outer edge 27. The inner edge of each insert member 26<br>
is attached to the second member 23. The outer edge of each insert member 27<br>
is attached to the hollow member 11 in which they are located. These<br>
attachments will preferably be in a substantially fluid tight manner to prevent any<br>
fluid flowing through these attachments. The method of attachment may be any<br>
conventional method, including adhesive means or collar means<br>
The insert members 12 are separated vertically The insert<br>
members 12 are separated by an equal spacing. The separation is accomplished<br>
by the method of attachment to the second member 23 The insert members 12<br>
will be held in their position by the method of attachment to the second member<br>
23.<br>
There are three different types of insert member 12 The first type<br>
of insert member 28 will be located at the upper and lower extremities of the<br>
hollow member 11. There is one of the first type of insert member 28 located at<br>
each of the upper and lower extremities of the hollow member 11. The first type<br>
of Insert member 28 is circular, have a central hole 25 which is of a diameter to<br>
engage with the second member 23, and have a plurality of openings on its<br>
circular surface 31 The openings 31 are holes to allow the flow of fluid through<br>
the insert member 12. The first type of insert member 28 is fitted to provide an<br>
even distribution of fluid around the diameter of the hollow member 11,<br>
The second type of insert member 29 will be located adjacent the<br>
upper first type of insert member 28. There are 9 of the second type of insert<br>
member 29 arrayed adjacent the upper first type of Insert member 28. The<br>
second type of insert member 29 will be circular, have a central hole 25 which is<br>
of a diameter to engage with the second member 23, and have a plurality of<br>
openings 31 on its circular surface. The openings 31 are holes to allow the flow<br>
of fluid through the insert member. The plurality of openings shall preferably be of<br>
two different sizes. The first sized opening in the second type of insert member<br>
32 is approximately 40 mm in diameter. The second sized opening in the second<br>
type of insert member 33 is approximately 15 mm in diameter. The two different<br>
the sized holes will be alternated around the circular surface of the insert member<br>
12.<br>
The second type of insert member 29 will preferably be covered by<br>
mesh member (not shown). The mesh member will have openings which are<br>
approximately 1 mm square. The mesh member is constructed of "fly screen"<br>
mesh. This mesh member is attached to the second type of insert member 29 to<br>
both its upper and lower circular surface. The mesh member will assist the gas<br>
exchange.<br>
The third type of insert member 30 will be located adjacent the<br>
lowest second type of insert member 29. There are 3 of the third type of insert<br>
member 30 arrayed adjacent the lowest second type of insert member 29. The<br>
third type of insert member 30 will be circular, have a central hole 25 which is of a<br>
diameter to engage with the second member 23, and have a plurality of openings<br>
31 on its circular surface. The openings 31 will preferably be holes to allow the<br>
flow of fluid through the insert member 30. The openings are of two different<br>
sizes The first sized opening in the third type of insert member 34 is<br>
approximately 40 mm in diameter. The second sized opening in the third type of<br>
insert member 35 is approximately 20 mm in diameter. The two different the<br>
sized holes will be alternated around the circular surface of the insert member 30<br>
The third type of insert member 30 is covered by a mesh member.<br>
The mesh member has openings which are smaller than 1 mm square. The mesh<br>
member is constructed of "sailing doth" mesh. This mesh member will be<br>
attached to the third type of insert member 30 to both its upper and lower circular<br>
surface. The weave of the mesh member attached to the third type of insert<br>
member 30 is much smaller than the weave of the mesh member attached to the<br>
second type of insert member 29. The mesh member will further assist the gas<br>
exchange.<br>
The insert members 12 will all preferably be fixed to the hollow<br>
member 11 such that the openings on the insert members 12 are not aligned.<br>
This will ensure that the fluid flowing through the hollow member does not have a<br>
fixed flow path This will provide a degree of agitation to the fluid.<br>
Insert members 12 are constructed of a rigid yet strong material,<br>
preferably such a material such as polyvinyl chloride (PVC) or other plastic.<br>
The means for gas intake and exhaust 36 will preferably be T-shaped. The<br>
vertical portion of the T-shaped means 36 is attached to the connecting member<br>
at the upper end of the hollow members 18. This will position the means for gas<br>
intake and exhaust 36 approximately 8 m above ground level.<br>
The crosspiece of the T-shaped means 35 has elbow joints on<br>
either end. The perpendicular portion of the elbow joints extend downward At<br>
the lower extremity of the perpendicular portion, there is a mesh cap member 36.<br>
The mesh cap member is dome shaped. There is more than one T-shaped<br>
means connected to the connecting member at the upper end of the hollow<br>
members 18.<br>
The means for gas intake and exhaust 36 is manufactured from<br>
polyvinyl chloride (PVC) or other plastic pipe. The diameter of the means is<br>
smaller than that of the hollow members 11.<br>
The means for gas intake and exhaust 36 is in fluid contact with the<br>
connecting member at the upper end of the hollow members 18, and therefore<br>
also be in fluid contact with the hollow members 11 themselves. This will allow<br>
flow of gases, particularly air, into and out of the hollow members 11<br>
The connection of the means for gas intake and exhaust 36 to the<br>
connecting member at the upper end of the hollow members 18 is such that the<br>
orientation of the means for gas intake and exhaust 36 with respect to the hollow<br>
members may be changed The means for gas intake and exhaust 36 may be<br>
located above the hollow members 11, they may also be arrayed on an angle to<br>
the hollow members 11. The means for gas intake and exhaust 36 are located to<br>
avoid the intake of ground level heat and dust.<br>
The means for draining the hollow member 39 is a hole in the<br>
connecting member at the lower end of the hollow members 22, This hole 39 is<br>
in substantially fluid type connection with an elongate tubular member 40 teadlng<br>
to a storage tank 41. The hole is disposed towards the underside of the<br>
connecting member 22 to allow draining of the hollow member 11 under the force<br>
of gravity.<br>
The means for adding liquid 42 to the upper end ot the hollow<br>
members 11 is a system of pipes 43 leading from the storage tank 42 This will<br>
allow the collection and recycling of any water/nutrient added to the hollow<br>
members 11. I he pipes are constructed of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) or plastic.<br>
The system of pipes 43 is ope ratively associated with a pump means 44, to pump<br>
the water/nutrient from the storage tank 42 to the upper end of the hollow<br>
members 11 At this point gravity will take over and act to draw the liquid down<br>
through the hollow members 11 to the means for draining the hollow members<br>
39.<br>
The system of pipes 43 is attached to the outside of the hollow<br>
members 11. There is only one pipe carrying water/nutrient to the upper end of<br>
the hollow members 11. At the upper end of the carrying pipe, will be a T-shaped<br>
joint which will allow splitting of the flow of water/nutrient into separate streams,<br>
each of which will then enter one of the hollow members 11 and flow downward<br>
towards the means for draining the hollow members 39.<br>
The water/nutrient will preferably enter the hollow members 11<br>
through substantially fluid type openings in the connecting member at the upper<br>
end of the hollow members 18 The fluid will then flow directly onto the first type<br>
of insert member 28 which will have the effect of dispersing the fluid evenly about<br>
the annular portion 24 of each of the hollow members 11<br>
Due to the pressure effect of pumping the water/nutrient into the<br>
upper end of the hollow members 11, air will be drawn from outside the hollow<br>
members 11, through the gas intake and exhaust means 36, into the hollow<br>
members 11. This air will then be mixed with the water/nutrient as it travels<br>
downward through the hollow members 11<br>
The apparatus operates as follows: water/nutrient is pumped from the<br>
storage tank 41 through the means for adding liquid 16 to the upper end of the<br>
hollow members 11 The liquid then falls under gravity's force through the<br>
elongate hollow members 11, and whilst doing so, is mixed with the air coming in<br>
through the means for gas intake and exhaust 14. Due to the pumping action<br>
when adding liquid, air is actually sucked into the means for gas intake and<br>
exhaust 14, and it is this air that mixes with the liquid as it falls.<br>
As the air coming into the hollow members 11, is generally cooler<br>
than the heated liquid from the storage tank 41, the liquid is also cooled The<br>
insert members 12 act to increase the surface area of the liquid and also to<br>
promote the mixing of the air with the liquid. The liquid at the bottom of the<br>
apparatus is a substantially cooler and higher in dissolved oxygen content then<br>
the liquid at the top of the apparatus, The liquid is then drained into the storage<br>
tank 41.<br>
The system 10 is substantially fluid tight and as such prevents<br>
fosses through evaporation and also acts to recycle the liquid. The system also<br>
acts to strip the water/nutrient liquid of any noxious gases which may be<br>
deleterious to plant life.<br>
