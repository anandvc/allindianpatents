impure material, and is -believed unsuitable for large scale use.<br>
An azide based synthetic route to macrocyclic tetra-amido ligands is described in Uffelman, E. S., PhD The-eis (California Institute of Technology, [1992]). This is described in further detail in United States Patent 5,853,428, filed 24 Feb 1997.<br>
A further synthetic route is disclosed in US 6127536 (Deline et al., filed May 25th 1999, issued October 3rd  2000). In this synthesis 1,2-phenylenediamine is reacted with 2-bromoisobutyryl bromide to form a precipitating intermediate which is cyclised by reaction with diethyl malonyl 15|  dichloride.<br><br>
Sunpaarrv of the Invention<br><br>
20|  WChave determined how an alternative synthetic route can be applied to obtain an improved yield of a ligand, which is believed- to  contain low level's of impurities. Furthermore, this yield and purity enables the formation of complexes in which the axial ligand is chlorine or water.<br>
in simple terms, this route employs an N-protected amino acid, which is first reacted, at its carbonyl end, in the form of an acid chloride, with a diamine and subsequently deprotected to produce a macro-linker with available amino 30  groups. -This macro-linker is reacted with a di-carbonyl<br><br>
species to form the macrocycle. This differs from the prior route in which the macro-linker is formed by reaction at the<br><br>
WO 02/16330<br><br>
PCT/EP01/09351<br><br>
amino group of the-acid and-subsequent ring closuafe occurs across the carbonyl groups of the amino acid residue..<br>
Accordingly, a first aspect of the present invention     provides a method for the synthesis of a ligand having the structure:<br><br><br>
10<br><br><br><br>
wherein:<br>
B2,   B3 and B4 each represent a bridging group having zero, one two or three carbon containing nodes for substitution, and B2 represents a bridging group having at least one carbon containing node for substitution, each said node containing a C (R) , C(R2) (R2) or C (R)2 ,<br>
each R substituent is the same is the same or different   from the remaining R substituents and<br>
(i)  is selected from the group consisting of alkyl,<br>
alkenyl, cycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl, aryl, alkynyl,<br><br>
WO 02/16330<br><br>
PCT/KI'OI/OWSI<br><br>
alkylaryl, halogen, alkoxy, phenoxy and combinations- thereof, or<br>
(ii) form a substituted or unsubstituted benzene ring<br>
of which two carbons on the ring form nodes in the B-unit",<br>
said method comprising the steps listed below in the order given<br>
a)	protecting the amino group of an amino aci'd comprising HOOC-B3-CRR-NH2 and/or HOOC-B4-CRR-NB2,<br>
b)	activating the carbonyl group of said amino acid,<br>
c)	reacting the carbonyl-activated amino acid with a diamine H2N-B2-NH2 to form a diamide diamine,<br>
d)	deprotecting said protected amino groups, and,<br>
e)	reacting the de-protected diamide diamine with an activated di-carbonyl' compound1 to form a tetra-amine macrocycle.<br>
It is preferred that HOOC-B3-CRR-NH2 and HOOC-B4-CRR-NH2 in step a) are the same.<br>
The aforementioned synthetic method is not restricted to B1 B2, B3 and B4 as defined above.  One skilled in the art will appreciate the B1# B2, B3 and BÂ« may represent any suitable spacing group that does not prevent the synthetic method from proceeding.  Where required a group that does inhibit the reaction is protected.  The particular length B2   B2, B3<br><br>

and B4 may effect the reaction because of entropy factors; nevertheless one skilled in the art will appreciate the limits in size of any ring being formed. It is with the scope of the present reaction for a chelating ion to be used to aid cyclization.<br>
A further aspect-.of the present invention subsists in those complexes, which, have simple axial ligands (water or halide) and a simple counter-ion (such as lithium). It is believed that these ligands are environmentally and toxicologically more acceptable than ligands such as trifluoroacetate, tetra-phenylphosphonium and tetra-ethylammonium.<br>
Accordingly, a further aspect of the present invention provides a bleach activator having the structure:<br><br>
wherein:<br>
B1, B3 and B4 each represent a bridging group having zero, one two or three carbon containing nodes for substitution, and B2 represents a bridging group having at<br><br>
WO 02/16330<br><br>

-	each R substituent is the same is the same or different<br>
from the remaining R substituents, and<br>
(i)  is selected from the group consisting of alkyl,<br>

consisting of Fe, ton, Cr, ,Cu, Co, . Ni) Mo,UV/ Zn land W./<br>
The present invention also extends to a packaged composition comprising a bleach activator as defined together with... instructions for its use in a method of laundering fabrics.<br><br>

Preferred compounds of the present invention have R = methyl. B3 and B4 are preferably absent, the two related sides of the ring being derived from a 'cXasÂ»ieal' amino acid in which the amino group is located on the alpha-carbon. A preferred starting amino acid is 2-amino ieo-butyric acid. (H2N-C (CH3) a-COOH) . ,v<br><br>
fn the initial stage of the synthesiSrâfefeeâamd-no  group of 40  the acid is  protected. The choice of protecting groups<br>
during synthesis to prevent undesirable reactions will be evident to one skilled in the art. For a discussion of protecting groups in organic synthesis the reader is directed to T. W. Green and P. G. M. Wuts, Protective Groups 1$  In Organic Synthesis 2nd Ed.; J. Wiley and Sons, 1991. Phthalic anhydride has been found to be a suitable protecting agent     .<br>
Activation of the carbonyl group following protection can be )  achieved by several means. One suitable means is reaction<br>
with a thionyl halide.to yield the acyl halide . Reaction with an excess of thionyl chloride is preferred- <br>
Following activation of the carbonyl, the protected macro-linker is formed by reaction with a diamine. The preferred diamines are phenylenediamines, preferably the' o-phenylenediamine. These may be optionally substituted as described in the patents of Collins et al., as mentioned above. It is preferred to use the unsubstituTed diamine.<br>

The protected amino groups of the macro-linker may be unprotected by any suitable reaction. Where phthalic anhydride has been used as the protecting agent the de-<br><br>
WO 02/16330<br><br>
PCT/EP01/09351<br><br><br>
protection can conveniently be accomplished through treatment with hydrazine hydrate. .<br>
Ring closure is conveniently obtained through reaction of the macro-linker with a di-carbonyl species, which has been activated. Preferably, Bl comprises a single substituted carbon atom. It is preferred that the portion of the heterocycle ring comprising Bl is derived from a malonate or oxalate. Bl most preferably is -(Me)2C-. Dimethylraalonyl chloride is a suitable reagent. It is preferable that the ring closure reaction is performed slowly and at high dilution to prevent the formation of side products.<br>
The following schematic shows a reaction scheme for the synthesis of a compound according to a preferred ^embodiment of the present invention. The individual reactions are described in more detail below.  The amino acid, 2-aminoisobutyric acid, 'A', is reacted with a protecting agent to form a derivative with a protected amino group VB'^ The carbonyl group of the protected amino acid is then activated to form species 'C. Reaction of two moles of XC with a mole.of o-phenylene diamine yields' the derivative lD', which is subsequentlxj^eprotected at 'l' to give the<br>
macro-linker 'E'	One skilledâis-the art will understand<br>
that differing protective groups may be used in the reaction, nevertheless a use of a single type-tSfprotecting group is preferred^Species ' E' is reacted with dimethyl malonyl chloride to close the ring structure and produce the final ligand (not snown). Metallisation of the ligand gives the active catalyst.<br><br>
WO 02/16330<br><br>
PCT/EPO1/09351<br><br><br><br>
Metallation of the ligand is preferably performed under<br><br>
nitrogen and in a non-aqueous solution such as dry tetrahydrofuran (THP) . The transition metal isâ.preferably selected from groups VI, VII, VIII, IX, X and XI of the<br>

A stirred suspension of 3,4,8,9-tetrahydro-3,3,6,6,9,9-hexamethyl-lH-1,4,8,ll-benzotetraazocyclotridecane-2,5,7,10 (6H,11H) tetrone (5 g) in THF (1 L) under a nitrogen atmosphere was heated to 40 Â°C.  The heated suspension was then treated with 31 mL butyl lithium causing the suspension to dissolve; 3 0 minutes after the treatment iron (II) chloride was added. After 36 hours the reaction mixture was cooled and filtered to provide a solid.  The solid was dissolved in water (1 L) yielding a solution of pH 12 which<br>
lp  was stirred and treated with a lithium hydroxide solution (1.5 mL) followed by addition of concentrated hydrochloric acid until the pH of the solution was 5 (colour change from brown to red/orange). The pH of the solution was then adjusted to pH 7 by addition of a lithium hydroxide solution<br>
L5  and the solvent removed under reduced pressure to yield a sticky orange solid.  The sticky orange solid was washed with methanol to provide a powder.  The powder was purified<br>
by dissolution in ethanol and elution through a Florisilâ¢ column with acetonitrile to yield the title compound.<br>
Wash Examples<br>
In the Following wash Examples 7 to 9 a 'base' colour washing powder with approximately the following composition was used (all percentages by weight). This 'base' differs slightly from commercial powders in that it does not contain colour care components. Otherwise, the composition is very similar to that of products available at present in the marketplace. 30(<br><br><br>

Colour of test samples are expressed in terms of AE.  For . further detail of this measurement the reader is directed to "Measuring Colour" by R.W.G. Hunt, Series in Applied Science and Industrial Technology, Ellis Horwood, (1976) and in 2|0  particular page 76 in which the CIELAB colour difference equation is given.<br>
The following experiments were performed in what is known as " over the side experiments" ; the components as detailed 2j5  were added separately via the draw of the washing machine to the wash.<br>
Example 7:  Washing Experiment<br><br>
3|p  The Base colour washing powder (I05g) was placed in the<br>
drawer of a Miele Novotronic (RTM) European-type horizontal-axis washing machine and the machine used to wash a 2.566 kg<br><br>
WO 02/16330	PCT/EP01/09351<br>
wash load. The load comprised 125Og non-mercerised white cotton sheeting, 1250g 50:50 white polycotton sheeting, and 5 x 900cm2 green cloth, 'direct green 26'   at 5%, unfixed, weighing 66g. The wash was conducted using the machines 4 0Â°C<br>
'5  program and 26 French hard water.<br>
After the wash the cloths were tumble dried and examined. Visual examination revealed that both the white cotton and poly-cotton sheeting had both become green due to pick up of 3/0  dye lost from the direct green cloth. Measurement of the<br>
CIELAB AE value of the cotton cloth compared to the original white gave a value of 10.5.<br>
The experiment was repeated with fresh cloth but in the 15  presence of 0.035g of the catalyst prepared in example 6 and 3.63g of a 35% solution of H202 was added. The CIELAB AE value of the cotton cloth compared to the original white was 2.4. Visual examination showed that the amount of green dye transferred to the white cloths had been significantly reduced.<br><br><br>
Example 8: Washing Experiment<br><br>
The protocol of example 7 was followed except the wash load 2)5  consisted of 2.566kg of a soiled load (dirty iea towels, pillow cases and towels, all 100% white cotton; 10 400cm2 clean white cotton monitor cloths; 5 900cm2 green cloth, dyed with direct green 26 at 5%, unfixed.<br>
!i0  After the washing and drying the white cotton cloths showed transference of the green dye on visual inspection. The<br><br><br>
WO 02/1633(1<br><br>
PCT/EP01/09351<br><br>
 CIELAB AE value of the cotton monitor cloth compared to the original white was 7.4<br>
The experiment was repeated with fresh cloth but with the levels of catalyst prepared in example 6 and levels of an aqueous 35% solution of H202 added as shown in Table 1 below. The average CIELAB AE value of the cotton monitor cloths at the various levels of catalyst and peroxide are given in Table 1 below. It can be seen that catalyst has reduced dye transfer when present.<br>
Table 1<br><br>
Added catalyst  in grams	Added H202   (35%) in grams	Measured AE<br>
0	0	7.4<br>
0.035	3.63	4.0<br>
0.035	14.57	4.4<br>
0.070	14.52	3.7<br>
Example 9:  Washing Experiment<br>
y"<br>
The protocol of example 7 was repeated, except the load consisted of 1.5kg of white Terry towelling, Â©uOg cotton sheeting, 400g of 1% unfixed Direct Black 22 cotton cloth.<br>
When washed without the catalyst being present the white cloth became visibly grey, and the CIELAB AE value of the cotton sheeting was 14.4 compared to the original. When the<br><br>
WO 02/16330	PCT/EPO1/09351<br><br>
catalyst was added at levels of 0.0035g with 0.36g of a 35% solution of H202, the CIELAB AE value of the cotton sheeting was 6.5 compared to the original. It can again be seen that dye transfer had been considerably reduced in the presence of the catalyst.<br><br>
