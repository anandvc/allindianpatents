				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
RADIO TRANSMISSION APPARATUS<br>
AND RADIO TRANSMISSION METHOD<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a radio<br>
transmission apparatus and radio transmission method.<br>
Background Art<br>
As a technology for realizing communications of<br>
large-volume data such as images, MIMO (Multi-Input<br>
Multi-Output) communications are being studied actively<br>
in recent years.<br>
Among them, BLAST (Bell Laboratories Layered<br>
Space-Time) in particular is a focus of attention as an<br>
application capable of realizing high-speed transmission<br>
using an MIMO channel. This is a technique for<br>
transmittingmutuallyindependent (or coded) streams from<br>
a plurality of transmission antennas and detecting the<br>
respective streams while repeating spatial filtering and<br>
removal of replicas on the receiving side.<br>
Furthermore, when the MIMO channel information is<br>
known to the transmitting side, it is known that a greater<br>
channel capacity can be obtained. More specifically,<br>
this is realized by carrying out directivity control using<br>
an eigen vector obtained through singular value<br>
decomposition of a matrix which consists of the respective<br><br><br>
channel responses of the MIMO channels as elements and<br>
forming a spatially orthogonal channel (eigen channel).<br>
That is, when the MIMO channel information is known to<br>
the transmitting side, it is possible to form an orthogonal<br>
channel through multi-beam formation using the eigen<br>
vector, performing transmit power control through an<br>
irrigation theorem and thereby maximize the channel<br>
capacity (e.g., TECHNICAL REPORT OF IEICE RCS2002-53<br>
(2002-05), Institute of Electronics, Information and<br>
Communication Engineers).<br>
When the above described technology is applied to<br>
an actual apparatus, radio transmission is carried out<br>
after preparing a plurality of transmission systems<br>
capable of carrying out transmission processing on a<br>
plurality of transmission data streams and assigning<br>
weights by multiplying the transmission signals by their<br>
respective complex weights (hereinafter simply referred<br>
to as "weights").<br>
When a bit error rate on the receiving side does<br>
not satisfy a predetermined value, an automatic<br>
retransmission request (ARQ; Automatic Repeat reQuest)<br>
is also generally practiced whereby the receiving side<br>
sends a retransmission request signal to the transmitting<br>
side and the transmitting side retransmits the same<br>
transmission data in response to this request.<br>
Especiallypacket transmission which transmits data<br>
traffic is required to guarantee error-free data<br>
transmission, and therefore error control through ARQ<br><br><br>
is indispensable. In addition, when an adaptive<br>
modulation and error correction intended to improve the<br>
throughput by selecting an optimal modulation system or<br>
coding system according to the condition of a propagation<br>
path (path)are applied to packet transmission, it is not<br>
possible to avoid measuring errors or packet errors caused<br>
by a control delay, etc., and therefore the 3GPP (3rd<br>
Generation Partnership Project) also standardizes the<br>
use of a hybrid ARQ (hereinafter referred to as "HARQ")<br>
which incorporates an FEC (Forward Error Correction)<br>
function.<br>
Therefore, by carrying out an MIMO communication<br>
using a plurality of antennas during data transmission<br>
to realize a large-volume data communication and<br>
retransmitting data when received data contains errors<br>
on the receiving side and by combining received data at<br>
the time of initial transmission with the received data<br>
at the time of retransmission using HARQ on the receiving<br>
side, a considerable improvement of throughput can be<br>
expected for this radio communication system.<br>
However, even when received data contains errors<br>
and data is retransmitted, if a time variation of an<br>
environment of a propagation path which a transmission<br>
signal follows is slow (see FIG.1), for example, when<br>
the communication apparatus is at rest or moving at a<br>
low speed, the diversity gain obtained with reception<br>
power on the receiving side is small, and therefore there<br>
is aproblemthat the throughput of the radio communication<br><br><br>
system hardly improves even if data is retransmitted.<br>
This is because when the time variation of the<br>
propagation path environment is slow, a signal whose<br>
reception level is low at the time of initial transmission<br>
also has a low transmission level at the time of data<br>
retransmission, and therefore data cannot be demodulated<br>
correctly even if the data at the time of initial<br>
transmission and data at the time of retransmission are<br>
combined. Furthermore, when a multi-antenna technology<br>
such as MIMO or STC (Space-Time Coding) is used, if the<br>
time variation of the propagation path environment is<br>
slow, there is little variation in the fading condition<br>
between initial transmission and data retransmission,<br>
and the combined data cannot be demodulated correctly.<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
It is an object of the present invention to increase<br>
a diversity gain obtained through data retransmission<br>
when data retransmission is controlled by a radio<br>
communication system (e.g., adaptive array antenna<br>
technology, MIMO technology, STC technology, etc.) which<br>
transmits a plurality of data streams using a plurality<br>
of antennas.<br>
This object is attained through a radio transmission<br>
apparatus and a radio transmission method which<br>
artificially changes the environment of a propagation<br>
path which data streams follow after the transmission<br>
from that at the time of previous transmission.<br><br><br>

Best Mode for Carrying out the Invention<br>
The present invention assumes roughly two cases for<br>
a method of changing a propagation path environment of<br>
a transmission signal. A first case is a method of<br>
changing weights to be multiplied on the transmission<br>
signal and a second case is a method of changing timings<br>
for transmitting the transmission signal.<br>
With reference now to the attached drawings,<br>
embodiments of the present invention will be explained<br>
in detail below. Note that Embodiment 1 describes a case<br>
where a weight to be multiplied on a transmission signal<br>
is changed and Embodiment 2 describes a case where a timing<br>
for transmitting a transmission signal is changed.<br>
(Embodiment 1)<br>
FIG.2 is a block diagram showing a configuration<br>
of a radio transmission apparatus according to Embodiment<br>
1 of the present invention. Here, a case where two<br>
streams; data stream lAand data stream #B are transmitted<br>
using two antennas will be explained as an example.<br>
The radio transmission apparatus shown in FIG.2 is<br>
provided with buffers 101, modulation sections 102,<br>
multipliers 103, addition sections 104, transmission<br>
radio (RF) sections 105, transmission antennas 106, a<br>
retransmission count detection section 110, a buffer<br>
control section 111 and a weight control section 112.<br>
In FIG.2, the data stream #A is input to the buffer<br><br><br>
101-1 and the data stream #B is input to the buffer 101-2.<br>
The buffers 101-1 and 101-2 store the input data<br>
streams in preparation for a data retransmission request<br>
from a radio reception apparatus. Then, upon reception<br>
of an instruction for data transmission from the buffer<br>
control section 111, the buffers 101-1 and 101-2 output<br>
the data to the modulation sections 102-1 and 102-2.<br>
The modulation section 102-1 carries out modulation<br>
processing on the data stream output from the buffer 101-1<br>
and outputs the data stream. The signal output from the<br>
modulation section 102-1 is branched at some midpoint<br>
and output to the multipliers 103-1 and 103-2. Likewise,<br>
the modulation section 102-2 carries out modulation<br>
processing on the data stream output from the buffer 101-2<br>
and outputs the data stream. The signal output from the<br>
modulation section 102-2 is branched at some midpoint<br>
and output to the multipliers 103-3 and 103-4.<br>
The multiplier 103-1 multiplies the signal output<br>
from the modulation section 102-1 by a weight output from<br>
the weight control section 112 and outputs the weighted<br>
signal to addition section 104-1 . On the other hand, the<br>
multiplier 103-2 multiplies the signal output from the<br>
modulation section 102-1 by a weight output from the weight<br>
control section 112 and outputs the weighted signal to<br>
addition section 104-2.<br>
Likewise, the multiplier 103-3 multiplies the<br>
signal output from the modulation section 102-2 by a weight<br>
output from the weight control section 112 and outputs<br><br><br>
the weighted signal to addition section 104-1. On the<br>
other hand, the multiplier 103-4 multiplies the signal<br>
output from the modulation section 102-2 by a weight output<br>
from the weight control section 112 and outputs the<br>
weighted signal to addition section 104-2. The weights<br>
multiplied on the signals by the multipliers 103-1 to<br>
103-4 will be described in more detail later.<br>
The addition section 104-1 adds up the weighted<br>
signals output from the multipliers 103-1 and 103-3 and<br>
outputs the addition result to the transmission radio<br>
section 1 05-1. Likewise, the addition section 1 04-2 adds<br>
up the weighted signals output from the multipliers 103-2<br>
and 103-4 and outputs the addition result to the<br>
transmission radio section 105-2.<br>
The transmission radio section 105-1 carries out<br>
predetermined radio transmission processing such as<br>
up-conversion on the signal output from the addition<br>
section 104-1, converts the signal to a radio signal and<br>
sends the radio signal through the antenna 106-1. On the<br>
other hand, the transmission radio section 105-2 likewise<br>
carries out radio transmission processing on the signal<br>
output from the addition section 104-2 and sends the signal<br>
through the antenna 106-2.<br>
The radio reception apparatus which has received<br>
the signals sent from the antennas 106-1 and 106-2 carries<br>
out error detection on the received signals and sends<br>
a NACK signal to the radio transmission apparatus<br>
according to this embodiment when an error is detected<br><br><br>
or sends an ACK signal when no error is detected.<br>
The retransmission count detection section 110<br>
detects a retransmission count of the data from the<br>
ACK/NACK signal notified from the above described radio<br>
reception apparatus and outputs the retransmission count<br>
to the buffer control section 111.<br>
The buffer control section 111 outputs control<br>
signals of data output to the buffers 101-1 and 101-2<br>
based on the retransmission count output from the<br>
retransmission count detection section 110. More<br>
specifically, when the radio reception apparatus sends<br>
a data retransmission request, the buffer control section<br>
111 controls the buffers 101-1 and 101-2 so as to output<br>
the data stored at the time of the previous transmission<br>
again.<br>
The weight control section 112 includes a table<br>
storing a plurality of types of weights, selects a weight<br>
to be multiplied on a transmission signal from the table<br>
according to the retransmission count detected by the<br>
retransmission count detection section 110 and outputs<br>
the weight to the multiplier 103. When data is<br>
retransmitted, it references the weight table again and<br>
outputs weights different from those at the time of initial<br>
transmission to the multipliers 103-1 to 103-4.<br>
FIG.3 is a block diagram showing a configuration<br>
of a radio reception apparatus according to this<br>
embodiment.<br>
This radio reception apparatus is provided with<br><br><br>
reception antennas 151, reception radio (RF) sections<br>
152, a MIMO reception section 153, buffers 154,<br>
demodulation sections 155, error detection sections 156,<br>
ACK/NACK signal generation sections 157 and<br>
retransmission count detection sections 158.<br>
InFIG.3, the reception radio (RF) sections 152 carry<br>
out predetermined radio processing such as<br>
down-conversion on signals received through the reception<br>
antennas 151 and outputs the signals to the MIMO reception<br>
section 153 .<br>
The MIMO reception section 153 separates the signals<br>
output from the reception radio sections 152 into two<br>
substreams, that is, streams #A and #B (MIMO reception<br>
processing) using propagation path characteristic<br>
information and outputs the streams to the respective<br>
buffers 154. This MIMO reception processing causes an<br>
inverse matrix of a matrix of 2 rows x 2 columns consisting<br>
of characteristics of propagation paths which the<br>
respective signals sent from the two antennas on the<br>
transmitting side follow as elements to act on the received<br>
signals to thereby obtain two substreams.<br>
In the case of packet data at the time of initial<br>
transmission, the buffers 154 immediately output this<br>
data to the demodulation sections 155. When a<br>
retransmission packet is sent, this data is temporarily<br>
stored and demodulated. When the packet is received<br>
correctly and an ACK signal is returned, the buffers are<br>
cleared. Being notified of the retransmission count from<br><br><br>
the retransmission count detection section 158, the<br>
buffer 154 can decide whether the packet is sent at the<br>
time of initial transmission or at the time of<br>
retransmission.<br>
The demodulation sections 155 carry out<br>
demodulation processing on the data streams output from<br>
the buffers 154 and obtain data stream #A and data stream<br>
#B.<br>
The error detection sections 156 detect errors and<br>
notify to the ACK/NACK signal generation sections 157<br>
of the errors.<br>
When notified from the error detection section 156<br>
that an error has been detected, the ACK/NACK signal<br>
generation sections 157 generate a NACK signal and send<br>
the NACK signal to the radio transmission apparatus and<br>
retransmission count detection section 158 or when<br>
notified from the error detection sections 156 that no<br>
error has been detected, the ACK/NACK signal generation<br>
sections 157 send an ACK signal to the radio transmission<br>
apparatus and retransmission count detection section 158 .<br>
FIG. 4 is a sequence diagram showing a flow of radio<br>
communication realized by the above described<br>
configuration.<br>
When sending a data stream, the transmission<br>
apparatus decides a weight to be multiplied on the<br>
transmission signal for each transmission system first<br>
(ST1010). Then, the transmission apparatus multiplies<br>
the transmission signal by this weight (ST1020) and sends<br><br><br>
a data stream (ST1030).<br>
The reception apparatus receives the data stream<br>
sent from the above described transmission apparatus<br>
(ST1040) and detects a data error (ST1050) . When some<br>
error is detected, the reception apparatus generates a<br>
NACK signal (ST1060) and sends the NACK signal to the<br>
above described transmission apparatus (ST1070).<br>
The transmission apparatus which has detected the<br>
NACK signal notified from the reception apparatus<br>
(ST1080) changes the weight decided in ST1010 for each<br>
transmission system (ST1090), multiplies it on the<br>
transmission signal to be retransmitted (ST1100) and<br>
retransmits this signal to the reception apparatus<br>
(ST1110) .<br>
Then, an example of weights multiplied on a<br>
transmission signal under the control of the weight<br>
control section 112 will be explained using FIG.5A and<br>
FIG.5B.<br>
FIG.5A illustrates weights to be multiplied on<br>
transmission signals arranged for data stream #A(SA) and<br>
data stream #B(SB) . For example, at the time of initial<br>
transmission of data, stream #A is multiplied by weight<br>
wa for the transmission system on the antenna 106-1<br>
(hereinafter referred to as "antenna #1") side and<br>
multiplied by weight wp for the transmission system on<br>
the antenna 106-2 (hereinafter referred to as "antenna<br>
#2") . Furthermore, stream #B is multiplied by weight wy<br>
for the transmission system on the antenna #1 side and<br><br><br>
multiplied by weight wδ for the transmission system on<br>
the antenna #2 side.<br>
Then, at the first retransmission, stream #A is<br>
multiplied by weight wγ for the transmission system on<br>
the antenna #1 side and multiplied by weight wδ for the<br>
transmission system on the antenna #2 side. Furthermore,<br>
stream #B is multiplied by weight wα for the transmission<br>
system on the antenna #1 and multiplied by weight wβ for<br>
the transmission system on the antenna #2 side<br>
That is, here, the weight used for the data stream<br>
#A at the time of initial transmission is used for the<br>
data stream #B for the first retransmission. Furthermore,<br>
the weight used for the data stream #B at the time of<br>
initial transmission is used for the data stream #A for<br>
the first retransmission. At the time of the initial<br>
transmission and first retransmission, weights used for<br>
the stream #A and stream #B are switched round.<br>
At the second retransmission, weights used for the<br>
stream #A and stream #B are switched round and the same<br>
weights as those at the time of initial transmission are<br>
used. At the third retransmission, weights used for the<br>
stream #A and stream #B are further switched round and<br>
the same weights as those at the first retransmission<br>
areused. Thatis, every time retransmission is repeated,<br>
weights used for the stream #A and stream #B are switched<br>
round.<br>
Here, weights to be multiplied on transmission<br>
signals arranged for the antenna #1 and antenna #2 from<br><br><br>
the different standpoint are shown in FIG.5B. That is,<br>
this figure shows what signals are actually sent from<br>
the antenna #1 and antenna #2. The contents shown in<br>
FIG.5A and FIG.5B are substantially the same.<br>
Then, effects resulting from changes of weights<br>
between the initial transmission and retransmission will<br>
be explained. When a weight is multiplied on a<br>
transmission signal, the transmission signal acquires<br>
directivity. However, this directivity does not mean<br>
that the transmission signal is actually propagating in<br>
a specific direction as seen in the formation of beams<br>
by an array antenna technology, but it is a matter of<br>
mathematical expressions. This is because while there<br>
is a low fading correlation between antennas in the MIMO<br>
communication, there is a high fading correlation between<br>
antennas in the array antenna technology. However, this<br>
expression is used in studying effects of weight<br>
multiplication of this embodiment because explaining with<br>
an image that a transmission signal is actually<br>
propagating with directivity facilitates an<br>
understanding.<br>
FIG. 6 is a conceptual view illustrating directivity<br>
of a transmission signal. Signals sent from a radio<br>
transmission apparatus 100 using weights wα and wβ follow<br>
a path #1 represented by a thick line, are reflected at<br>
some midpoint by a building 191 and reach a radio reception<br>
apparatus 150 without any significant reduction of their<br>
intensity. On the other hand, signals sent using weights<br><br><br>
wγ and wδ follow a path#2 represented by a thin line, are<br>
reflected at some midpoint by a building 192 and reach<br>
the radio reception apparatus 150 affected by the<br>
propagation path with their intensity significantly<br>
weakened.<br>
At the time of initial transmission, the stream #A<br>
multiplied by weights wα and wβ follows the path #1 and<br>
the stream #B multiplied by weights wα and wβ follows the<br>
path #2. Then, at the time of retransmission the weights<br>
to be multiplied on the transmission signals are switched<br>
round, and therefore the stream #A follows the path #2<br>
and the stream #B follows the path #1.<br>
FIG.7A, FIG.7B, FIG.8A and FIG.8B show quality<br>
comparisons between signals sent from a conventional<br>
radio transmission apparatus and signals sent from the<br>
radio transmission apparatus according to this embodiment<br>
These figures show conceptual views illustrating the<br>
quality (bar graphs) of received signals after being<br>
combined on the receiving side and a level L1 at which<br>
data can be received correctly.<br>
FIG.7A and FIG.7B show cases of the conventional<br>
radio transmission apparatus. FIG.7A illustrates<br>
reception quality at the time of initial transmission<br>
and FIG.7B illustrates reception quality at the time of<br>
data retransmission.<br>
In FIG.7A, the quality level of the received signal<br>
of none of the stream #A and the stream #B exceeds the<br>
level L1. At this time, the receiving side cannot receive<br><br><br>
data correctly, and therefore sends back a NACK signal<br>
to the transmitting side and the transmitting side<br>
retransmits the data. However, when the time variation<br>
of the propagation path environment is small, no<br>
significant improvement of the reception quality on the<br>
receiving side can be expected even at the time of data<br>
retransmission. Thus, as shown in FIG.7B, by combining<br>
the received signal at the time of initial transmission<br>
and the received signal at the time of data retransmission<br>
after the data retransmission, the reception quality<br>
after the combination of the stream #A which had original<br>
reception quality at a level close to the level L1 at<br>
the time of initial transmission exceeds the level L1.<br>
On the other hand, even if data is retransmitted, the<br>
reception quality of the stream #B after the combination<br>
cannot exceed the level L1. Thus, the receiving side<br>
sends back an NACK signal to the transmitting side several<br>
times more until the reception quality of the stream #B<br>
exceeds the level L1 and the transmitting side retransmits<br>
data every time the NACK signal is sent.<br>
FIG.8A and FIG.8B show the case of the radio<br>
transmission apparatus according to this embodiment.<br>
FIG.8A illustrates reception quality at the time of<br>
initial data transmission and FIG.8B illustrates<br>
reception quality at the time of data retransmission.<br>
FIG.8A is the same as FIG.7A. None of the reception<br>
quality levels of the stream #A and stream #B exceeds<br>
the level L1. However, at the time of retransmission,<br><br><br>
weights used for the stream #A and stream #B are switched<br>
round, and therefore the environments of propagation<br>
paths which the stream #A and stream #B follow are placed<br>
in a condition as if those environments are averaged.<br>
In this way, both the reception quality levels of the<br>
streams #A and #B after combining the received signals<br>
at the time of initial transmission and at the time of<br>
retransmission exceed the level L1, and it is therefore<br>
possible to receive signals correctly.<br>
In the above described configuration, the weight<br>
control section 112 of the radio reception apparatus<br>
according to this embodiment changes weights to be<br>
multiplied on the transmission signal from the weights<br>
used for the previous transmission every time data is<br>
retransmitted.<br>
This causes each data stream to be sent to the<br>
receiving side through different propagation path<br>
environments between the previous transmission and<br>
retransmission, and therefore the probability that the<br>
same data may contain errors successively is reduced and<br>
as a result, the data error rate characteristic after<br>
packet combination improves . In other words, adiversity<br>
gain when the retransmission data is combined on the<br>
receiving side increases and the reception performance<br>
on the receiving side improves.<br>
Furthermore, the weight control section 112 of the<br>
radio reception apparatus according to this embodiment<br>
switches round the weights corresponding to the<br><br><br>
respective antennas at the time of the previous<br>
transmission and multiplies the transmission signals by<br>
those weights every time data is retransmitted.<br>
For example, as shown in FIG.7A or FIG.8A, even if<br>
the receiving side sends back a NACK signal at the time<br>
of initial transmission, reception quality of all data<br>
streams is not averagely bad but it is often the case<br>
that reception quality of only some data streams is bad.<br>
At this time, by switching round weights to be<br>
multiplied on the transmission signals between previous<br>
transmission and retransmission, the propagation path<br>
environments for the respective data streams are switched<br>
round and averaged, and therefore the reception quality<br>
improves at an early stage.<br>
Furthermore, since the weights already used at the<br>
time of the previous transmission are reused at the time<br>
of retransmission by only switching round the signals<br>
to be multiplied, and therefore there is no need for<br>
processing such as feeding back other information, for<br>
example, the propagation path information detected on<br>
the receiving side to the transmitting side.<br>
Thus, according to this embodiment, weights to be<br>
multiplied on transmission signals are switched round<br>
between the initial transmission and retransmission, and<br>
therefore it is possible to increase a diversity gain<br>
obtained through data retransmission and improve<br>
reception performance on the receiving side.<br>
Note that here a case where transmission data<br><br><br>
consists of two streams #A and #B has been explained as<br>
an example, but the number of data streams can be three<br>
or more, and in this case, it is possible to use weights<br>
to be used at the time of data retransmission in rotation<br>
every time data is retransmitted. That is, in the case<br>
of three data streams, the weights used at the time of<br>
the initial transmission are reused at the third<br>
retransmission.<br>
Furthermore, here, a MIMO transmission having a low<br>
fading correlation between antennas has been explained,<br>
but it is also possible to use an array antenna having<br>
a high fading correlation between antennas . At this time,<br>
antennas are arranged so that the fading correlation<br>
between antennas becomes substantially 1. Directivity<br>
patterns as shown in FIG.6 are formed by multiplying<br>
transmission signals by weights. The stream #A<br>
multiplied by weights wα and wβ at the time of the initial<br>
transmission follows the path #1 and the stream #B<br>
multiplied byweights wα and wβ follows the path #2. Then,<br>
at the time of retransmission, weights to be multiplied<br>
on the transmission signals are switched round, and<br>
therefore the stream #A follows the path #2 and the stream<br>
#B follows the path #1 . This makes it possible to average<br>
propagation path environments as with the above described<br>
case .<br>
Here, a case whereweights of the stream #A and stream<br>
#B are switched round at the time of data retransmission<br>
has been explained as an example, but it is also possible<br><br><br>
to select not the weights used at the time of the previous<br>
transmission but totally different values as weights for<br>
retransmission.<br>
Furthermore, here a case where the propagation path<br>
information, etc., detected on the receiving side is not<br>
fed back to the transmitting side has been explained as<br>
an example, but for a radio transmission apparatus in<br>
which channel quality information is fed back from the<br>
receiving side to the transmitting side for the purpose<br>
of increasing the channel capacity and weights are decided<br>
so that more power is assigned to channels of good quality,<br>
it is also possible to fine-tune weights based on this<br>
fed back channel quality information and assign weights<br>
so that the channel quality exceeds the minimum level<br>
L1 in all paths.<br>
(Embodiment 2)<br>
FIG.9 is a block diagram showing a configuration<br>
of a radio transmission apparatus according to Embodiment<br>
2 of the present invention. This radio transmission<br>
apparatus has the same basic configuration as that of<br>
the radio transmission apparatus shown in FIG.2 and the<br>
same components are assigned the same reference numerals<br>
and explanations thereof will be omitted.<br>
Features of this embodiment include that it is<br>
provided with IFFT sections 201, delay sections 202 and<br>
a delay control section 203, it carries out a communication<br>
based on an OFDM scheme, adds delay times which differ<br><br><br>
from one transmission data stream to another, transmits<br>
the data streams through their respective antennas at<br>
different transmission timings at the time of<br>
transmission and thereby drastically changes the<br>
characteristic of a received signal on the frequency axis.<br>
Therefore, it is possible to drastically change the<br>
propagation path environment every time retransmission<br>
is performed. Furthermore, transforming data into a<br>
multicarrier according to the OFDM scheme makes it<br>
possible to multiplex delay signals with different delay<br>
times and send the multiplexed signals.<br>
Then, an operation of the radio transmission<br>
apparatus in the above described configuration will be<br>
explained.<br>
The modulation section 102-1 carries out modulation<br>
processing on a data stream output from the buffer 101-1<br>
and outputs the data stream. The signal output from the<br>
modulation section 102-1 is branched at some midpoint<br>
and output to the IFFT sections 201-1 and 2 01-2 . Likewise<br>
the modulation section 102-2 carries out modulation<br>
processing on a data stream output from the buffer 101-2<br>
and outputs the data stream. The signal output from the<br>
modulation section 102-2 is branched at some midpoint<br>
and output to the IFFT sections 201-3 and 201-4.<br>
On the other hand, the delay control section 203<br>
includes a table storing a plurality of types of delay<br>
times, selects a delay time for each transmission signal<br>
from the table according to a retransmission count<br><br><br>
notified from the retransmission count detection section<br>
110 and outputs the delay time to the delay sections 202-1<br>
to 202-4. The delay times output from the delay control<br>
section 203 will be explained in more detail later.<br>
The delay section 202-1 delays the transmission<br>
timing of the signal output from the IFFT section 201-1<br>
by a delay time output from the delay control section<br>
203 and outputs the delayed signal to the addition section<br>
104-1. Furthermore, the delay section 202-2 delays the<br>
transmission timing of the signal output from the IFFT<br>
section 2 01-2 by a delay time output from the delay control<br>
section 203 and outputs the delayed signal to the addition<br>
section 104-2.<br>
Likewise, the delay section 202-3 delays the<br>
transmission timing of the signal output from the IFFT<br>
section 2 01-3 by a delay time output from the delay control<br>
section 203 and outputs the delayed signal to the addition<br>
section 104-1. Furthermore, the delay section 202-4<br>
delays the transmission timing of the signal output from<br>
the IFFT section 201-4 by a delay time output from the<br>
delay control section 203 and outputs the delayed signal<br>
to the addition section 104-2.<br>
The addition section 104-1 adds up the signals output<br>
from the delay sections 202-1 and 202-3, the transmission<br>
timings of which have been delayed and outputs the addition<br>
result to the transmission radio section 105-1 . Likewise,<br>
the addition section 104-2 adds up the signals output<br>
from the delay sections 202-2 and 202-4, the transmission<br><br><br>
timings of which have been delayed and outputs the addition<br>
result to the transmission radio section 105-2. The<br>
processing thereafter is the same as that in Embodiment<br>
1 .<br>
Then, an example of a delay time added to a<br>
transmission signal of each system will be explained using<br>
FIG.10A and FIG.10B.<br>
FIG.10A shows delay times of transmission timings<br>
of transmission signals arranged for data stream #A(SA)<br>
and data stream #B(SB). For example, at the time of<br>
initial data transmission, the delay time of the stream<br>
#A is 0 for the transmission system on the antenna #1<br>
side and Τ α for the transmission system on the antenna<br>
#2 side. Furthermore, the delay time of the stream #B<br>
is 0 for the transmission system on the antenna #1 side<br>
and τ β for the transmission system on the antenna #2 side .<br>
Then, at the first retransmission, the delay time<br>
of the stream #A is 0 for the transmission system on the<br>
antenna #1 side and τ β for the transmission system on the<br>
antenna #2 side. Furthermore, the delay time of the<br>
stream #B is 0 for the transmission system on the antenna<br>
#1 side and τ α for the transmission system on the antenna<br>
#2 side.<br>
That is, the combination of delay times of the data<br>
stream #Aat the time of the initial transmission is applied<br>
to the data stream #B at the time of the first<br>
retransmission. Furthermore, the combination of delay<br>
times used for the data stream #B at the time of the initial<br><br><br>
transmission is applied to the data stream #A at the first<br>
retransmission. The combinations of delay times used for<br>
the stream #A and stream #B at the time of the initial<br>
transmission are switched round at the time of the first<br>
retransmission.<br>
At the time of the second retransmission, the delay<br>
time used for the transmission system on the antenna #1<br>
side and the delay time used for the transmission system<br>
on the antenna #2 side at the time of the initial<br>
transmission are switched round. That is, the delay time<br>
of the stream #A is Τ α for the transmission system on the<br>
antenna #1 side and 0 for the transmission system on the<br>
antenna #2 side, and the delay time of the stream #B is<br>
Τ β for the transmission system on the antenna #1 side<br>
and 0 for the transmission system on the antenna #2 side.<br>
At the third retransmission, the delay times used for<br>
the stream #A and stream #B are further switched round.<br>
Now, by changing the standpoint, delay times of<br>
transmission signals arranged for the antenna #1 and<br>
antenna #2 are shown in FIG.10B. That is, this figure<br>
shows how signals are actually delayed and sent through<br>
the antenna #1 and antenna #2. The contents shown in<br>
FIG.10A and FIG.10B are substantially the same.<br>
FIG.11 shows transmission timings of signals<br>
transmitted from the above described radio transmission<br>
apparatus on the time axis. Note that the actual<br>
transmi ssion data streams are weighted (e.g., the signals<br>
transmitted from the antenna #1 are wαSA+wγSB as described<br><br><br>
above) , but the same weights at the time of the initial<br>
transmission are also used at the time of the<br>
retransmission in this embodiment, and therefore<br>
notations of weights will be omitted to make it easier<br>
to distinguish one signal from another.<br>
This figure shows that initial data transmission<br>
is performed at time 0 and data retransmission is performed<br>
at time t1 afteralapseof acertaintime. From the antenna<br>
#1, data stream #A (SA, S'A) and data stream #B (SB, S'B)<br>
are transmitted at the same timing for both the initial<br>
transmission and retransmission . On the other hand, from<br>
the antenna #2, SA and SB are transmitted with delay times<br>
Τ α, and Τ β, respectively at the time of initial<br>
transmission, while S'A and S'B are transmitted with delay<br>
times Τ β and Τ α, respectively at the time of<br>
retransmission.<br>
Here, when attention is focused on the data stream<br>
#A(SA) at the time of the initial transmission, SA is<br>
transmitted with a time difference Τ α provided between<br>
the antenna #1 and antenna #2. This is intended to reduce<br>
a fading correlation between the antennas. On the other<br>
hand, when attention is focused on the data stream #A(S'A)<br>
at the time of the retransmission, the time difference<br>
providedbetween the antenna #1 and antenna #2 is z p. That<br>
is, transmission is carried out in such a way that the<br>
fading correlation between the antennas is changed at<br>
the time of the initial transmission and at the time of<br>
the retransmission. The also applies to the data stream<br><br><br>
#B(SB, S'B) in like fashion.<br>
Furthermore, when attention is focused on both SA<br>
and SB transmitted from the antenna #2 at the time of the<br>
initial transmission, SB is transmitted ( Τ β-Τα) behind<br>
SA. On the other hand, at the time of the retransmission,<br>
S'A is transmitted (Τ β-Τα) behind S'B on the contrary.<br>
This means that transmission is carried out in such a<br>
way that the difference in transmission timings between<br>
the data stream #A and data stream #B (including the<br>
relationship as to which is ahead and which is behind)<br>
is changed at the time of the initial transmission and<br>
at the time of the retransmission. Here, for simplicity<br>
of explanation, attention has been focused only on the<br>
data stream transmitted from the antenna #2, but the same<br>
thing is also applied when the data stream transmitted<br>
from the antenna #1 is taken into consideration together.<br>
The effect of changing the difference in<br>
transmission timings between data streams at the time<br>
of the initial transmission and at the time of the<br>
retransmission will be explained below. Speaking<br>
plainly, frequency selective fading is a result of signals<br>
with the same frequency and a phase difference of 180<br>
degrees weakening each other. Thus, by intentionally<br>
delaying transmission timings of transmission signals,<br>
that is, shifting phases, it is possible to change a fading<br>
characteristic that a signal receives. FIG.12A to<br>
FIG.12C show reception power at a conventional apparatus .<br>
A stream #A keeps a high reception level both at the time<br><br><br>
of initial transmission (see FIG.12A) and at the time<br>
of retransmission (see FIG.12B), while a stream #B keeps<br>
a low reception level both at the time of initial<br>
transmission and at the time of retransmission.<br>
Therefore, even if the data at the time of the initial<br>
transmission and the data at the time of the retransmission<br>
are combined (see FIG.12C), only the stream #A reaches<br>
the level for correct reception and the stream #B remains<br>
at levels where it cannot be received correctly.<br>
FIG.13A to FIG.13C show reception power according<br>
to this embodiment. The levels of received signals are<br>
affected by frequency selective fading which differs<br>
between the streams. Therefore, the pattern of the<br>
reception level on the frequency axis differs between<br>
the streams. At the time of initial transmission (see<br>
FIG.13A) and at the time of retransmission ( see FI G . 1 3B ) ,<br>
delay processes applied to the stream #A and stream #B<br>
are switched round, and therefore the levels of signals<br>
after being combined on the receiving side are averaged<br>
(see FIG.13C) and both the stream #A and stream #B can<br>
be demodulated correctly.<br>
Here, the figures describe a situation in which the<br>
phase of the fading characteristic curve on the frequency<br>
axis is shifted by 180 degrees by delaying transmission<br>
signals. However, it will be sufficient to change the<br>
fading characteristic only to a certain degree by delaying<br>
transmission signals in this embodiment, and the phase<br>
need not always be shifted by 180 degrees. Note that the<br><br><br>
fluctuation pitch of the fading characteristic depends<br>
on the moving speed of a mobile station and the frequency<br>
band used for communications , and therefore it is possible<br>
to calculate a delay time for shifting the phase of the<br>
fading characteristic curve by 180 degrees.<br>
Furthermore, when the propagation path information<br>
such as channel quality is fed back from the receiving<br>
side to the transmitting side in the above described<br>
configuration as in the case of Embodiment 1, it is also<br>
possible to fine-tune delay times based on this fed back<br>
propagation path information.<br>
Thus, according to this embodiment, variations in<br>
the reception level are averaged on the frequency axis<br>
of each stream for every retransmission, and therefore<br>
it is possible to demodulate the combined signal correctly<br>
and improve the reception performance on the receiving<br>
side .<br>
Note that Embodiment 1 and Embodiment 2 can be used<br>
in combination. That is, it is possible to further add<br>
a delay time to a transmission signal multiplied by a<br>
weight to delay the transmission timing and transmit the<br>
delayed signal. At this time, the effects of the<br>
respective embodiments are superimposed, making it<br>
possible to further improve the reception performance.<br>
As described above, the present invention allows<br>
a radio communication system which transmits a plurality<br>
of data streams using a plurality of antennas (e.g.,<br>
adaptive array antenna technology, MIMO technology, STC<br><br><br>
technology, etc.) to increase, for example, when HARQ<br>
is applied, a diversity gain at the time of data<br>
retransmission and improve the reception performance on<br>
the receiving side.<br>
This application is based on the Japanese Patent<br>
Application No.2002-268968 filed on September 13, 2002,<br>
entire content of which is expressly incorporated by<br>
reference herein.<br>
