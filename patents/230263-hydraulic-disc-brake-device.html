BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a hydraulic disc brake device, and more particularly<br>
to a hydraulic disc brake device used in a brake system of a vehicle.<br>
Description of the Prior Art<br>
Most of the conventional hydraulic disc brake devices utilize the oil cylinder to press<br>
the two brake lining shoes against the brake disc from both sides, and the friction<br>
force generated between the brake lining shoe and the brake disc stops the vehicle.<br>
However, these conventional hydraulic disc brake devices still have the following<br>
disadvantages:<br>
The clamping force caused by the oil pressure in the case of an emergency brake is<br>
always very great, and the resultant braking force will be excessively large, and thus<br>
probably causing a sudden dead lock. As a result, not only will the tire be locked, but<br>
also the vehicle will suffer an instant run-out, leading to a skidding or overtximing of<br>
the vehicle.<br>
The present invention has arisen to mitigate and/or obviate the afore-described<br>
disadvantages.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The primary objective of the present invention is to provide a hydraulic disc brake<br>
system that has an antilock effect.<br>
The secondary objective of the present invention is to provide an economical and low<br>
cost hydraulic disc brake system for a vehicle, without needing any precision<br>
electronic instruments or electric mechanism.<br>

513 of the two guide covers 511. The control groove 51 is coimected to the oil<br>
chamber 21 via the main passage 54 and the pressure relief space 56, and the avixiliary<br>
passage 55 is connected to the safety oil passage 43 of the second arc-shaped track 40.<br>
A sealing screw 542 cooperating with a sealing ring 541 is disposed opposite the main<br>
passage 54. Located opposite the auxiliary passage 55 is an oil feeding hole 551. The<br>
relief valve 53 includes a pressure relief steel ball 531, a pin 532 and a spring 533<br>
disposed in the pressure relief space 56, respectively. A sealing screw 57 with a<br>
sealing ring 571 is disposed beside the pressure relief space 56. The pin 532 is to be<br>
pressed against the spring 533 and the oil pressure of the oil chamber 21. The pressure<br>
relief steel ball 531 is located in the control groove 51, and the pin 532 is sealed<br><br>
between the oil chamber 21 and the control groove 51 together with a first sliding<br>
bush 534, an oil seal 535, a second sliding bush 536 and an dust-proof cover 537. A<br>
plurality of oil seals 521, a first oil ring 522, a second oil ring 523 and a slidmg bush<br>
59 are positioned in the mid section of the control groove 51 by a C ring 58. The first<br>
and second oil rings 522 and 523 each is formed with an open guiding structure for<br>
guiding oil out. The first oil ring 522 is located correspondingly to the main passage<br>
54, and the second oil ring 523 is located correspondingly to the auxiliary passage 55.<br>
The control rod 52 is formed with a control passage 524, and an oil seal 526 and a<br>

527 and a second oil hole 528 are formed in the control passage 524 and are located<br>
correspondingly to the first oil ring 522 and the second oil ring 523, respectively. An<br>
annular neck portion 529 is formed on the control rod 52 and is located<br>
correspondingly to the pressure relief space 56. When the pressure relief steel ball 531<br>
moves into the annular neck portion 529, a pressure relief oil space B will appear at<br>
another end of the pin 532 opposite the pressure relief steel ball 531.<br>
The shding assembly H is slideably disposed on the first and second arc-shaped track<br>
30 and 40 of the base assembly G and includes a seat 60, a brake lining assembly 70<br>
and a sliding device 80.<br>
The seat 60 includes a first positioning portion 61 and a second positioning portion 62<br>
located correspondingly to the first and the second arc-shaped tracks 30 and 40 of the<br>
base assembly G. A stop portion 63 is formed at the end of the second positioning<br>
portion 62. An anti-collision piece 631 is fixed on the stop portion 63 by screws 632.<br>
A screw 633 is disposed at the center of the stop portion 63 and the anti-collision<br>
piece 631. Formed between the first and second positions 61 and 62 is an elliptical<br>
sliding hole 64 for passage of the piston 22 of the pressing device 20 and the flange<br>
Gl of the base assembly G. A stepped recess 641 is formed at a side of the elliptical<br>
sliding hole 64, and an anti-collision block 642 and a fixing piece 644 are fixed in the<br>
stepped recess 641 by screws 643. A brake-mounting portion 65 protrudes from the<br>
seat 60 and is located around the elliptical sliding hole 64, so that a brake space 66 is<br>
defined between the brake-mounting portion 65 and the elliptical sliding hole 64 for<br>
accommodation of the brake disc 11 and the brake lining assembly 70. Screwed on<br>
the brake-mounting portion 65 are two brake-lining positioning shafts 651 that are to<br>
be inserted in the seat 60 and located at both sides of the elliptical sliding hole 64. The<br><br>
brake-mounting portion 65 is provided with an engaging rib 652 located in the brake<br>
space 66. Two opposite abutting blocks 67 are arranged at a side of the elliptical<br>
sliding hole 64, and each of which is provided with an abutting screw 671 and an<br>
auditing nut 672. The two abutting blocks 67 are pressed against both ends of the<br>
control rod 52.<br>
The brake lining assembly 70 includes a fi-ont brake lining shoe 71 and a rear brake<br>
lining shoe 72 that are inserted on the two brake-lining positioning shafts 651 in a<br>
parallel manner, and the brake-lining positioning shafts 651 enables the firent brake<br>
lining shoe 71 and the rear brake lining shoe 72 to move within the brake space 66. A<br>
pressing spring leaf 73 is disposed against a side of the firont brake lining shoe 71 and<br>
the rear brake lining shoe 72 and is positioned on the engaging rib 652 of the brake-<br>
moimting portion 65 of the seat 60, thus preventing the front brake lining shoe 71 and<br>
the rear brake lining shoe 72 from becoming loose. In addition, the front brake lining<br>
shoe 71 is pressed against the steel balls 26 on the steel ball positioning disc 25, and<br>
can move smoothly under the aid of the steel balls 26.<br>
The sliding device 80 includes inverted U-shaped seats 81, dust-proof frames 82 and<br>
wear-resistance pieces 83. The inverted U-shaped seats 81 are fixed on the first and<br>
second positioning portions 61 and 62 of the seat 60 by rivets 85. The inverted U-<br>
shaped seats 81 are slideably moimted on the first and second arc-shaped fracks 30<br>
and 40. A plurality of cavities 811 with steel balls 812 are formed in the respective<br>
inverted U-shaped seats 81, and the steel balls 812 are located between the inverted<br>
U-shaped seat 81 and the wear-resistance cover 32 and 42. The respective dust-proof<br>
frame 82 is fixed to the inverted U-shaped seat 81 by screws 84, so as to prevait dust<br>
from entering the arc-shaped tracks.<br>
The spring assembly S is confined in the hole 41 of the second arc-shaped track 40 by<br>
the anti-collision piece 631 and the screw 633 of the sliding assembly H, and includes<br>
a safety rod 90, two seal rings 91, a safety spring 92, a support bracket 93, a washer<br>
94 and a return spring 95. One end of the return spring 95 cooperating with the<br>
washer 94 and the support bracket 93 is pressed against the bottom of the hole 41 of<br>
the second arc-shaped track 40, and another end of the return spring 95 is positioned<br>
on the screw 633 of the seat 60. The return spring 95 serves to push against the stop<br><br>
portion 63 of the sliding assembly H. The safety spring 92 is restricted in the support<br>
bracket 93 and the return spring 95, and the safety rod 90 is riveted to the support<br>
bracket 93. The safety rod 93 and the return spring 95 push the safety rod 90 to move,<br>
so as to close the safety oil passage 43 of the second arc-shaped track 40.<br>
As shown in Fig. 4, before braking action is initiated, the brake disc 11 rotates<br>
counterclockwise along with the wheel, the front brake lining shoe 71 and the rear<br>
brake lining shoe 72 are located at both sides of the brake disc 11 in a pressure fiwe<br>
manner. At this moment, since the return spring 95 is biased between the hole 41 of<br>
the second arc-shaped track 40 of the base assembly G and the anti-collision piece<br>
631 of the sliding assembly H, the motionless base assembly G enables the sliding<br>
assembly H to be pushed by the return spring 95 to the lowest portion of the arc-<br>
shaped track. Accordingly, the two opposite abutting blocks 67 of the sliding<br>
assembly H are also located at the lowest portion of the arc-shaped track, and push the<br>
lower end of the control rod 52 of the control valve assembly 50 upward. Since the<br>
control rod 52 moves with respect to the control groove 51 of the control valve<br>
assembly 50, the control passage 524 of the control rod 52 will be aligned to the first<br>
oil hole 527, and the second oil hole 528 and the second oil ring 523 will exactly be<br>
aligned to the oil feeding hole 551. As a result, the oil W from the oil feeding hole<br>
551 will flow to the oil chamber 21 via the second oil ring 523, the second oil hole<br>
528, the control passage 524, the first oil hole 527, the first oil ring 522 and the main<br>
passage 54. However, before the oil W pressure increases, the piston 22 will not be<br>
driven by any oil pressure from the oil chamber 21.<br>
On the other hand, the sliding assembly H doesn't move relative to the base assembly<br>
G, therefore, the front surface of the front brake lining shoe 71 is not pressed against<br>
the steel balls 26. At this moment, the brake lining assembly 70 doesn't clamp the<br>
brake disc 11, and the annular neck portion 529 of the control rod 52 is located below<br>
the pressure relief steel ball 531 of the pressure relief valve 53. Therefore, the wheel<br>
can rotate freely without any resistance.<br>
When the hydraulic disc brake device is activated at a relatively high speed, as both<br>
shown in Figs. 4 and 5, the brake disc 11 still rotates coimterclockwise, at this<br>
moment, the oil W increases in pressure and flows from the oil feeding hole 551 to<br><br>
the oil chamber 21 via the second oil ring 523, the second oil hole 528, the control<br>
passage 524, the first oil hole 527, the first oil ring 522 and the main passage 54 (as<br>
indicated by the arrow). Meanwhile, the piston 22 of the pressing assembly 20 is<br>
moved by the oil pressure firom the oil chamber 21, pushing the front brake lining<br>
shoe 71 toward the rear brake lining shoe 72, as a result, the brake disc 11 is clamped<br>
firmly by the front and second brake lining shoes 71 and 72, causing an emergency<br>
braking action.<br>
After that, as shown in Fig. 5, at the instant the braking action is initiated, the front<br>
and second brake lining shoes 71 and 72 absorb a lot of counterclockwise stress from<br>
the brake disc 11, generating a very large counterclockwise sfress toward the center of<br>
the brake disc 11. Since the sliding assembly H is slideably disposed in the first and<br>
second arc-shaped tracks 30 and 40 of the base assembly G, the first and second arc-<br>
shaped tracks 30 and 40 are located opposite the center of the brake disc 11, plus the<br>
inertial force produced by an emergency of a high speed vehicle is larger than the<br>
critical value of the elastic force of the return spring 95 of the spring assembly S. The<br>
emergency-brake ca\ised sfress will push the sliding assembly H to slide<br>
counterclockwise while compressing the return spring 95 (as shown in Fig, 5).<br>
At the same time, the coimterclockwise motion of the slide assembly H causes a<br>
displacement of the slide assembly H relative to the base assembly G, and the abutting<br>
blocks 67 of the sliding assembly H push the confrol rod 52 of the confrol valve<br>
assembly 50 to move, so that the confrol groove 51 of tiie confrol valve assembly 50<br>
changes with the upward movement of the confrol rod 52, and the first and second oil<br>
rings 522 and 523 are not aligned with the main passage 54 and the auxiliary passage<br>
55 anymore. Therefore, the oil W stops flowing into the oil chamber 21. At this<br>
moment, the confrol rod 52 of the confrol valve assembly 50 moves upward,<br>
therefore, the annular neck portion 529 of the confrol rod 52 moves upward to a<br>
position aligned with the pressure relief steel ball 531. Under the effect of the pushing<br>
force of the spring 533 and the oil pressure of the oil chamber 21, the pin 532 pushes<br>
the pressure relief steel ball 531 into the annular neck portion 529 of the confrol rod<br>
52, and as a result, a pressure relief oil space B appears at another end of the pin 532<br>
facing the oil chamber 21. At this moment, the oil W will be decompressed instantly<br>
after flowing into the pressure relief oil space B, so that the piston 22 of the pressing<br><br>
device 20 reduces its pushing force on the front brake lining shoe 71, and accordingly,<br>
the brake lining assembly 70 relieves its clamping force against the brake disc 11. At<br>
this moment, the brake-caused counterclockwise stress disappears from the sliding<br>
assembly H, and the return spring 95 pushes the sliding assembly H back to its<br>
original position. Meanwhile, the sliding assembly H rotates about the base assembly<br>
G. The aimular neck portion 529 of the control rod 52 moves downward (to disengage<br>
from the pressure relief steel ball 531 again), the pressure relief steel ball 531 pushes<br>
the pin 532 and the spring 533 backward, so that the pressure relief oil space B<br>
disappears. Meanwhile, the control groove 51 of the control valve assembly 50<br>
changes with the downward movement of the confrol rod 52, and the first and second<br>
oil rings 522 and 523 are aligned with the main passage 54 and the auxiliary passage<br>
55 again. Therefore, the oil W flows into the oil chamber 21 again (the pressure<br>
thereof increases again), and the brake lining assembly 70 instantly clamps the brake<br>
disc 11 again. Such instant clamping and instant relief actions will occur repeatedly,<br>
preventing the brake disc from being clamped too tight (antilock effect).<br>
It is to be noted that a plurality of anti-collision structures are provided on the sliding<br>
assembly H and opposite the base assembly G, wear-resistance structures are arranged<br>
at the positions where the friction frequently occurs, and the present invention is also<br>
provided with a plurality of position adjustment structures.<br>
Referring then to Figs. 6 and 7, aiming at the safety operation, the present invention is<br>
particularly provided with the safety rod 90, the safety spring 92 and the support<br>
bracket 93. If the return spring 95 is broken (as shown in Fig. 6), the support bracket<br>
93 will not be pushed by the return spring 95 anymore but will be subjected to the<br>
pushing force of the safety spring 92. At this moment, the support bracket 93 will be<br>
deformed or will move downward, and the safety rod 90 will lose its supporting force<br>
since it is riveted to the support bracket 93. As a result, the end of the safety rod 90<br>
doesn't seal the safety oil passage 43 of the second arc-shaped frack 40 anymore.<br>
Meanwhile, the oil W from the oil feeding hole 551 flows into the safety oil passage<br>
43 via the second oil ring 523 of the control valve assembly 50, and constantly<br>
increases the pressure of the oil chamber 21. Although the control rod 52 cooperates<br>
with the pressure relief steel ball 531 to produce a pressure relief oil space B, the oil<br>
from the safety oil passage 43 can still enable the brake lining assembly 70 to keep<br>
firmly pressing against the brake disc 11. Therefore, the emergency brake effect (only<br><br>
the antilock effect is lost) can still be ensured even if the return spring 95 is broken.<br>
Furthermore, if the return spring 95 fatigues, the safety rod 90, the safety spring 92<br>
and the support bracket 93 can still produce the effect of emergency brake.<br>
Referring to Figs. 8 and 9, which show a second embodiment. In this embodiment,<br>
there are two sets of oil chambers 21, pistons 22 and steel-ball positioning discs 25,<br>
and each set includes the oil seals 23, 23a, 24, 24a, steel-ball positioning discs 25,<br>
25a, a plurality of steel balls 26, 26a, and pistons 22, 22a slideably sealed in two oil<br>
chambers 21, 21a. The two oil chambers 21 are in commimication with each other via<br>
a main passage 54. An exhaust valve 27 is arranged beside the oil chamber 21, and a<br>
safety oil passage 43 is formed beside the oil chamber 21a. By using the double<br>
pressing devices 20, the resultant braking force will be more strong, and the antilock<br>
effect will be better.<br>
Fig. 10 shows a third embodiment of the present invention, this embodiment is<br>
additionally provided with a main cylinder C3 and an elastic oil-storage cylinder C31.<br>
The seat CI is installed on the wheel carrier 10 and serves to cooperate with the<br>
moveable base assembly C2. The status of the hydraulic disc brake device before<br>
braking action is shown in Figs. 11-14, the status of the hydraulic disc brake device<br>
during braking action is shown in Figs. 15-18, and the status of tiie hydraulic disc<br>
brake device during antilock action is shown in Figs. 19-21.<br>
The seat CI is fixed onto the wheel carrier 10, a L-shaped stop board CI 1 is riveted to<br>
either side of the seat CI, and a space is defined between the two L-shaped stop<br>
boards CI 1. The two L-shaped stop boards CI 1 are located in the arc-shaped route of<br>
the wheel axis. Two sliding members CI2 with opening facing each other are<br>
disposed in the arc-shaped route of the wheel axis, and each of the sliding members<br>
C12 is a structure with one end closed and with an interior receiving space.<br>
The base assembly C2 includes a pressing device C21, a first arc-shaped track C22, a<br>
second arc-shaped track C23, a control valve assembly C24, a spring assembly C25,<br>
the main cylinder C3 and the elastic oil-storage cylinder C31.<br>
The spring assembly C25 is confined in the first arc-shaped track C22 by the sliding<br>
assembly CI2, and includes a safety rod, two seal rings, a safety spring, a support<br>
bracket, a washer and a return spring. One end of the return spring cooperating with<br><br>
the washer and the support bracket is pressed against the bottom edge of the first arc-<br>
shaped track, and another end of the return spring is pressed against the sliding<br>
members CI 2 of the seat CI. The safety spring is restricted in the support bracket and<br>
the return spring, and the safety rod is riveted to the support bracket.<br>
The pressing device C21 includes a piston C211, and a plurality of oil seals C212.<br>
Since the pressing device C21 moves along with the base assembly C2 and the<br>
braking lining assembly C26, it doesn't need the steel balls and the steel-ball<br>
positioning disc, and it can use the conventional pressing device to cooperate with the<br>
brake lining assembly C26, and the brake lining assembly C26 is pressed to clamp the<br>
brake disc 11.<br>
The first and second arc-shaped tracks C22 and C23 are also provided with the wear-<br>
resistance covers C221, C231, the sling members C12 are slideably installed on the<br>
first and second arc-shaped tracks C22 and C23. An antic-collision cushion C232 is<br>
disposed at the end of the second arc-shaped track C23, and the first arc-shaped track<br>
C22 is interiorly formed with safety oil passage. The end of the safety rod of the<br>
spring assembly C25 is pushed by the return spring to close the safety oil passage.<br>
The assembly, function and effect of the control valve assembly C24 are similar to the<br>
previous embodiment, and the only difference is that the position and the structure of<br>
the oil route are changed appropriately.<br>
It is to be noted that the main cylinder C3 and the elastic oil-storage cylinder C31 are<br>
installed on the base assembly C2 directly. The main cylinder C3 utilizes a steel cord<br>
C32 to drive the main piston C33, so as to push the oil into the oil chamber. A<br>
pushing spring C34, an O-shaped ring C36, and a piston C35 are sealed in the elastic<br>
oil-storage cylinder C31 by a cover C37. The pushing spring C34 pvishes the piston<br>
C35 to move, so as to push the oil into the main cylinder C3, and the oil pressure of<br>
the main cylinder C3 is directly connected to the control valve assembly C24.<br>
In this embodiment, the seat CI is mounted on the wheel carrier 10.<br>
The main cylinder can also be mounted on the handlebar.<br><br><br>
