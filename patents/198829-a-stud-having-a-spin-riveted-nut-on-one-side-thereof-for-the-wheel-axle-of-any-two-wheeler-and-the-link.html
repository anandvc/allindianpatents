				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to a stud having a spin riveted nut on one side thereof for the wheel-axle of any two-wheeler and the like.<br>
As known, in an axle in any known form of a bolt for the two-wheelers and the like, the axle has the thread on one side thereof and from its free-end. Through said thread, a nut is normally secured to the axle for tightening. However, other end of the axle has been so far provided with a head. This head is as an integral part of said stud or with at least any polygon-shape for firmly holding said axle-bolt by any suitable tool(s) during that, the tightening of the nut on said first end-side of said axle-bolt. Nevertheless, the cost of manufacturing of said polygon headed axle-bolt is quite larger than that of any stud of similar size. Because, it obviously requires higher cost for making said axle-bolt integrated with said head either by forging or by machining. In addition, the manufacturing time for said axle-bolt is significantly longer than that for any stud of similar size and thereby it obviously decreases its productivity than that of the stud. Thus, commercially, the manufacturing of said axle-bolt has been so far significantly costlier than that of the stud of similar size. On the other hand, the stud having threads on its both end-side for tightening a nut on its each side, is required both more time and more efforts for its assembly than that of the former axle-bolt and nut. In addition, at least the damaging of any one of the threads of the latter stud has obviously required the whole replacement of the stud rather than the former axle-bolt.<br><br>
An object of this invention is to provide a stud having a spin riveted nut on one side thereof for the wheel-axle of any two-wheelers and the like to minimize the cost thereof.<br>
Another object of this invention is to provide with the minimum manufacturing cost,<br>
A further object of this invention is to provide with for enhancing the productivity of assembly thereof,<br>
With these and other objects in view, the present invention provides a stud having a spin riveted nut on one side thereof for the wheel-axle of any two-wheeler and the like, wherein a stud in any known form and having threads on its each end-side, is capable of being tightly secured with a nut on each side of said stud, the mating threads between said stud and any one of said nuts is firmly tightened and bonded in place by an adhesive on said stud to firmly secure any angular movement therebetween and with respect to each other and subsequently the protruded f ree-end of said stud from said nut provided is spin riveted.<br>
The invention will now be apparent from the following non-limitative description with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which;<br><br>
FIGURE 1 showM a pictorial view of an assembly of a stud having a spin riveted nut on one side thereof;<br>
FIGURE 2 shows a pictorial view of what is shown in FIGURE 1, with said spin riveted nut being half-sectioned along its axis;<br>
FIGURE 3 shows a pictorial view of what is shown in FIGURE 1, with said spin riveted nut being full-sectioned along its axis;<br>
FIGURE 4 shows an orthographic view of what is shown in FIGURE 2 along its avis;<br>
FIGURE $ shows a pictorial view of the assembly of said stud<br>
having a flanged nut as a replacement of what is shown in FIGURES 1. to 4,<br>
Referring to the drawings, a studjin any known form is having threads 1A and IB on its each side in a known way. The stud 1 is capable of normally secured with each of nuts 2 and 3 respectively on each of the free-end yl A and IB of said stud 1 in the known way. The said second nut 3 is employed for the known purpose. The<br><br>
mating threads between said threaded part 1A of the stud 1 and said first nut 2 are applied with an adhesive before their assembly (tightening). So that the threads between said stud 1 and first nut 2, are permanently locked together and with respect to each other.<br>
Consequently, said first nut 2 is also angularly secured on (said threaded part 1A of) the stud I with respect to each other. Further, the free-end of said threaded part 1A of the stud 1 protruding from said first nut 2 which is firmly tightened (screwed) thereon 1 A, is also then additionally spin riveted as referred by 4, This spin-riveting 4 still increases the resistance of said stud 1 for capable of being secured particularly against any axial movement or its tendency with any axial load, Consequently, it also too increases its resistance against any angular movement or its tendency even under the normal clamping load.<br>
In one preferred embodiment of this invention, said adhesive applied is specifically an anaerobic adhesive.<br>
This     preferred     embodiment	of	this	invention<br>
minimizes its manufacturing time for the same size as that of  the   conventional  axle-bolt   made  by  conventional<br><br>
machining-processes (like milling or turning). Since, the adhesive only applied on that mating threads and this spin-riveting process do not totally require as much time as that of the conventional manufacturing-process of making the conventional axle-bolt of similar-size. However, it excludes the forging-process of making that conventional aHle-bolt. Otherwise, the manufacturing cost for making this preferred embodiment is obviously lower than that of even the forging process. In addition, this preferred-embodiment significantly minimises its manufacturing cost than that of the conventional manufacturing/machining-processes also. Moreover, it eliminates the scrap of material during manufacturing unlike the conventional machining-processes. Thereby it minimises the cost incurred by the material(s) rather than that of the conventional machining processes of making the conventional axle-bolt. In addition, it also increases its productivity by 20% than that of the conventional manufacturing-processes of making the conventional axle-bolt.<br>
In another preferred embodiment of this invention, said first nut 2 is replaced by a flanged nut 5 as shown in FIGURE 5 for its known application(s). This flanged nut 5 has the larger bearing-contact area with the contact-surface on which said spin-riveted flanged-nut with said stud 1. This embodiment is applicable for decreasing the bearing-contact pressure thereby increasing the axial load carrying capacity for the wheel-axle applications. Moreover, this flanged nut also eliminates the requirements of the washer on said spin-riveted nut side of said stud unlike in the conventional axle-bolt. In addition, the<br><br>
conventional axle-bolt having a flanged head is also replaced by said stud having said spin-riveted flanged nut.<br>
This later preferred embodiment of this invention substantially minimizes the total number of components of the assembly thereby also minimizes its commercial cost. It also reduces the time required for its assembly.<br>
These preferred embodiments of this invention are specifically more applicable for the axl&amp;OS) of twtvwheeler(s).<br>
The terms and expressions used herein are illustrative and not limitative in any sense.<br><br><br>
