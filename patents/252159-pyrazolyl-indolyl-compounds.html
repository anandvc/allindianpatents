It has been found that compounds of formula I are useful as lipid modulators and<br>
insulin sensitizers. In particular, compounds of formula I are PPAR activators.<br>
Peroxisome Proliferator Activated Receptors (PPARs) are members of the nuclear<br>
hormone receptor superfamily. The PPARs are ligand-activated transcription factors that<br>
regulate gene expression and control multiple metabolic pathways. Three subtypes have<br>
been described which are PPARa, PPARS (also known as PPARP), and PPARy. PPAR8<br>
is ubiquitously expressed. PPARa is predominantly expressed in the liver, kidney and<br>
heart. There are at least two major isoforms of PPARy. PPARyl is expressed in most<br>
tissues, and the longer isoform, PPARy2 is almost exclusively expressed in adipose<br>
tissue. The PPARs modulate a variety of physiological responses including regulation of<br>
glucose- and lipid- homeostasis and metabolism, energy balance, cell differentiation,<br>
inflammation and cardiovascular events.<br>
Approximately half of all patients with coronary artery disease have low<br>
concentrations of plasma HDL cholesterol. The atheroprotective function of HDL was<br>
first highlighted almost 25 years ago and stimulated exploration of the genetic and<br>
environmental factors that influence HDL levels. The protective function of HDL comes<br>
from its role in a process termed reverse cholesterol transport. HDL mediates the removal<br>
of cholesterol from cells in peripheral tissues including those in the atherosclerotic<br>
lesions of the arterial wall. HDL then delivers its cholesterol to the liver and sterolmetabolizing<br>
organs for conversion to bile and elimination. Data from the Framingham<br>
study showed that HDL-C levels are predictive of coronary artery disease risk<br>
independently of LDL-C levels. The estimated age-adjusted prevalence among<br>
Americans age 20 and older who have HDL-C of less than 35 mg/dl is 16% (males) and<br>
5.7% (females). A substantial increase of HDL-C is currently achieved by treatment with<br>
niacin in various formulations. However, the substantial side-effects limit the therapeutic<br>
potential of this approach.<br>
As many as 90% of the 14 million diagnosed type 2 diabetic patients in the US are<br>
overweight or obese, and a high proportion of type 2 diabetic patients have abnormal<br>
concentrations of lipoproteins. The prevalence of total cholesterol &gt; 240 mg/dl is 37% in<br>
diabetic men and 44% in women. The respective rates for LDL-C &gt; 160 mg/dl are 31%<br>
and 44%, respectively, and for HDL-C 
is a disease in which a patient's ability to control glucose levels in blood is decreased<br>
because of partial impairment in response to the action of insulin. Type II diabetes (T2D)<br>
is also called non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) and afflicts 80-90 % of<br>
all diabetic patients in developed countries. In T2D, the pancreatic Islets of Langerhans<br>
continue to produce insulin. However, the target organs for insulin action, mainly<br>
muscle, liver and adipose tissue, exhibit a profound resistance to insulin stimulation. The<br>
body continues to compensate by producing unphysiologically high levels of insulin,<br>
which ultimately decreases in later stage of disease, due to exhaustion and failure of<br>
pancreatic insulin-producing capacity. Thus T2D is a cardiovascular-metabolic syndrome<br>
associated with multiple comorbidities including insulin resistance, dyslipidemia,<br>
hypertension, endothelial dysfunction and inflammatory atherosclerosis.<br>
First line treatment for dyslipidemia and diabetes generally involves a low-fat and<br>
low-glucose diet, exercise and weight loss. However, compliance can be moderate, and<br>
as the disease progresses, treatment of the various metabolic deficiencies becomes<br>
necessary with e.g. lipid-modulating agents such as statins and fibrates for dyslipidemia<br>
and hypoglycemic drugs, e.g. sulfonylureas or metformin for insulin resistance. A<br>
promising new class of drugs has recently been introduced that resensitizes patients to<br>
their own insulin (insulin sensitizers), thereby restoring blood glucose and triglyceride<br>
levels to normal, and in many cases, obviating or reducing the requirement for exogenous<br>
insulin. Pioglitazone (Actos™) and rosiglitazone (Avandia™) belong to the<br>
thiazolidinedione (TZD) class of PPARy-agonists and were the first in their class to be<br>
approved for NIDDM in several countries. These compounds, however, suffer from side<br>
effects, including rare but severe liver toxicity (as seen with troglitazone). They also<br>
increase body weight in patients. Therefore, new, more efficacious drugs with greater<br>
safety and lower side effects are urgently needed. Recent studies provide evidence that<br>
agonism of PPAR5 would result in compounds with enhanced therapeutic potential, i. e.<br>
such compounds should improve the lipid profile, with a superior effect on HDL-C<br>
raising compared to current treatments and with additional positive effects on<br>
normalization of insulin-levels (Oliver et al; Proc Nat Acad Sci USA 2001; 98: 5306-11).<br>
Recent observations also suggest that there is a independent PPARa mediated effect on<br>
insulin-sensitzation in addition to its well known role in reducing triglycerides (Guerre-<br>
Millo et al; J Biol Chem 2000; 275: 16638-16642). Thus selective PPARa agonists,<br>
selective PPAR5 agonists or PPAR a/8 agonists may show superior therapeutic efficacy<br>
without the side-effects such as the weight gain seen with pure PPARy agonists.<br>
The novel compounds of the present invention exceed the compounds known in the<br>
art, inasmuch as they bind to and selectively activate PPARa or coactivate PPAR8 and<br>
PPARa simultaneously and very efficiently, and with much improved pharmacokinetic<br>
properties. Therefore, these compounds combine the anti-dyslipidemic and anti-glycemic<br>
effects of PPARa and PPAR8 activation with slightly no effect on PPARy.<br>
Consequently, HDL cholesterol is increased, triglycerides lowered (=improved lipid<br>
profile) and plasma glucose and insulin are reduced (=insulin sensitization). In addition,<br>
such compounds may also lower LDL cholesterol, decrease blood pressure and<br>
counteract inflammatory atherosclerosis. Furthermore, such compounds may also be<br>
useful for treating inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, and<br>
psoriasis. Since multiple facets of combined dyslipidemia and the T2D disease syndrome<br>
are addressed by PPARSselective agonists and PPAR8 and a coagonists, they are<br>
expected to have an enhanced therapeutic potential compared to the compounds already<br>
known in the art.<br>
The compounds of the present invention further exhibit improved pharmacological<br>
properties compared to known compounds.<br>

Starting materials are either commercially available or can be prepared by methods<br>
analogous to the methods given below, by methods described in references cited in the<br>
text or in the examples, or by methods known in the art.<br>
Compounds of formula (I) (compounds 7 and 8 in scheme 1) can be synthesized<br>

Scheme 1<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
-Hydroxyindols 1 and the regioisomeric 4- and 5-hydroxyindols are commercially<br>
available, known or can be synthesized by methods known in the art. The hydroxy<br>
function of compounds 1 can be protected by methods described in the literature, e. g. by<br>
treating them with tert-butyldimethylsilyl chloride in the presence of imidazole,<br>
preferably at room temperature in solvents like N,N-dimethylformamide, to obtain the<br>
corresponding tert-butyldimethylsilyl ethers 2 (step a). N-Alkylation of intermediates 2<br>
with carboxylic acid ester 3, where R17 can be equal to e. g. chlorine, bromine, triflate, or<br>
another leaving group, delivers indoles 4 and can be performed by standard technology;<br>
e. g. in the presence of KaCOs or CS2CO3 at temperatures between 10 °C and the reflux<br>
temperature of the solvent in a solvent like acetonitrile or acetone or in the presence of<br>
sodium hydride at temperatures between -10 °C and 50 °C in a solvent like N,Ndimethylformamide<br>
(step b). Ester derivatives 3 are commercially available or can be<br>
synthesized by methods known in the art. Deprotection of indoles 4 by methods<br>
described in the literature, e. g. by treatment with tetrabutyl ammonium fluoride at<br>
temperatures between -15 °C and ambient temperature in a solvent like tetrahydrofuran,<br>
provided that the protection group is a silyl ether, gives hydroxyindols 5 (step c).<br>
Pyrazole compounds 6 (prepared as outlined in schemes 3-6) are condensed with<br>
hydroxyindols 5 according to well known procedures: if R16 represents a hydroxy group<br>
e. g. via Mitsunobu-reaction, with triphenylphosphine and di-tert-butyl-, diisopropyl- or<br>
diethyl-azodicarboxylate as reagents, or by using tributylphosphine and N,N,N',N'-<br>
tetramethyl azodicarboxamide; this transformation is preferably carried out in a solvent<br>
like toluene, dichloromethane or tetrahydrofuran at ambient temperature. Alternatively, if<br>
R16 represents a halide, mesylate or tosylate moiety, the pyrazole compounds 6 can be<br>
reacted with hydroxyindols 5 in solvents like N,N-dimethylformamide, acetonitrile,<br>
acetone or methyl-ethyl ketone in the presence of a weak base like cesium or potassium<br>
carbonate in a temperature ranging from room temperature to 140 °C, preferably around<br>
50 °C, to yield ether compounds 7 (step d). Those can optionally be hydrolyzed<br>
according to standard procedures, e. g. by treatment with an alkali hydroxide like LiOH<br>
or NaOH in a polar solvent mixture like tetrahydrofuran/ethanol/water leading to<br>
carboxylic acids 8 (step e). If the pyrazole compounds 6 (prepared as described in<br>
schemes 3-6) and/or the hydroxyindols 5 contain chiral centers, ester compounds 7 and<br>
carboxylic acids 8 are obtained as mixtures of diastereomers or enantiomers, which can<br>
be separated by methods well known in the art, e. g. (chiral) HPLC or crystallization.<br>
Carboxylic acid esters 7 can alternatively be synthesized via regioselective<br>
condensation of pyrazoles 6 with hydroxyindols 1 under the conditions given in step d<br>
(step f) and subsequent alkylation of the obtained ethers 9 with alkylating reagents 3 as<br>
described for the synthesis of esters 4 in step b (step g).<br>
6-Hydroxyindoles 1 (scheme 1) and O-protected 6-hydroxyindols 2 (scheme 1) as<br>
well as their regioisomeric 4- and 5-hydroxyindol analogues are known or can be<br>
synthesized by methods known in the art. Examples for possible syntheses of these key<br>
intermediates (compounds 6 and 7 in scheme 2) are given in scheme 2 for R8 in I being<br>
equal to hydroxy or protected hydroxy. Analogous key intermediates where R6 or R7 is<br>
equal to hydroxy or hydroxy carrying a protecting group can be synthesized applying the<br>
same reaction sequence.<br>

Introduction of a protecting group at the nitrogen atom of indols 1 can be<br>
performed under standard conditions, e. g. by deprotonation with a base like nbutyllithium,<br>
preferably at -78 °C, and subsequent addition of e. g. tert-butyldimethylsilyl<br>
chloride at temperatures between -78 °C and ambient temperature in solvents like<br>
tetrahydrofuran (step a). Halogenation of protected indols 2, e. g. through reaction with<br>
N-bromosuccinimide at temperatures between -78 °C and ambient temperature in<br>
solvents like tetrahydrofuran delivers 3-halo indols 3 (step b). Compounds 3 can -<br>
following halogen metal exchange, preferably with tert-butyllithium at -78 °C in solvents<br>
like tetrahydrofuran - be reacted with alkylating reagents 4 with X e. g. being a chlorine,<br>
bromine or iodine atom, preferably with alkyl iodides, at temperatures between -78 °C<br>
and ambient temperature in solvents like tetrahydrofuran, to form indols 5 bearing a<br>
substituent in position 3 (step c). N-Deprotection or simultaneous N- and O-deprotection<br>
of compounds 5 leading to building blocks 6 can be performed by methods described in<br>
the literature, e. g. by treatment with tetrabutyl ammonium fluoride at temperatures<br>
between -15 °C and ambient temperature in a solvent like tetrahydrofuran, if the<br>
protecting groups are silyl ethers and/or silylated indoles (step d).<br>
Building blocks 7 carrying a chlorine, bromine or iodine substituent in position 3<br>
can be synthesized by halogenation of indols 1, optionally carrying a protecting group at<br>
the hydroxy function, e. g. by reaction with N-chlorosuccinimide at temperatures<br>
between -15 °C and the reflux temperature of the solvent in solvents like<br>
dichloromethane or chloroform (step e). Alternatively, the same halo-indols 7 can be<br>
obtained via N-deprotection or N- and O-deprotection of indols 3 as described in step d<br>
(step f).<br>
Pyrazoles 6 (scheme 1) are commercially available, known or can be synthesized<br>
by methods known in the art. Representative examples of possible syntheses of these key<br>
intermediates are given in schemes 3-6.<br>

Substituted acetophenones and heteroaryl ketones 1 are commercially available,<br>
known or can be prepared by methods known in the art. Acylation of compounds 1 with<br>
oxalate derivatives can be performed under standard conditions, e. g. with diethyl oxalate<br>
in the presence of a base like sodium ethoxide at temperatures between -78 °C and 50 °C<br>
in solvents like ethanol, or with with lithium hexamethyldisilazide at temperatures<br>
between -78 °C and ambient temperature in solvents like ether, to form after subsequent<br>
acidification free ethyl pyruvates 2 (step a). Alternatively, pyruvates 2 can be synthesized<br>
via i) transforming ketones 1 into the corresponding silyl enol ethers 3, e. g. through<br>
treatment with trimethylsilyl chloride in the presence of a base like triethylamine at<br>
temperatures between 0 °C and 40 °C in a solvent like acetonitrile (step b); ii) in situ<br>
formation of a metal enol ether, e. g. with zinc chloride and subsequent acylation with an<br>
acylation reagent like ethyl oxalyl chloride at temperatures between 0 °C and 50 °C in a<br>
solvent like toluene or dichloromethane (step c). Pyruvates 2 can be converted to<br>
regioisomeric pyrazoles 4 and 5 through condensation with monosubstituted hydrazines<br>
F^NNHR12713 which are commercially available, known or can be prepared by methods<br>
known in the art, e. g. at temperatures between ambient temperature and the reflux<br>
temperature of the solvent in solvents like ethanol (step d). Alternatively, pyrazoles 4 and<br>
5 can be synthesized via i) reacting pyruvates 2 with hydrazine, preferably at reflux<br>
temperature in ethanol (step e); ii) conversion of the obtained pyrazole 6 into<br>
regioisomeres 4 and 5 under standard conditions, e. g. through alkylation with an alkyl<br>
halogenide in the presence of a base like potassium hydroxide at temperatures between<br>
-78 °C and the reflux temperature of the solvent in solvents like ethanol (step f).<br>
Regioisomeric pyrazoles 4 and 5 can easily be separated by techniques well known in the<br>
art, e. g. through column chromatography on silica. Reduction of esters 4 and 5 can be<br>
performed by methods well known in the art, e. g. with lithium aluminium hydride at<br>
temperatures between 0 °C and the reflux temperature of the solvents in solvents like<br>
tetrahydrofuran or diethyl ether (step g).<br>
The alcohol compounds 7 and 8 correspond to or can be converted into compounds<br>
of general formula 6 (scheme 1), e. g. by treatment with methanesulfonyl chloride in<br>
dichloromethane in the presence of a base like triethylamine preferably in a temperature<br>
range between -20 °C and room temperature, or e. g. by reaction with carbon<br>
tetrachloride or carbon tetrabromide and triphenylphosphine in solvents like<br>
tetrahydrofuran, preferably in a temperature range between room temperature and the<br>
reflux temperature of the solvents.<br>
Scheme 4<br>

Reduction of pyrazole esters 1 (compounds 4, 5 and 6 in scheme 3), preferably<br>
using lithium aluminum hydride in a solvent like ether or tetrahydrofuran, preferably<br>
between 0 °C and room temperature, gives primary alohols 2 (step a), which can be used<br>
as such or can be converted into the corresponding halides 3, e. g. by treatment with<br>
methanesulfonyl chloride in dichloromethane in the presence of 2,6-lutidine, preferably<br>
between -20 °C and the reflux temperature of dichloromethane, by treatment with<br>
thionyl chloride in a solvent like dichloromethane or chloroform, preferably at<br>
temperatures between -20 °C and +50 °C, or by treatment with tetrabromomethane and<br>
triphenylphosphine in solvents like tetrahydrofuran at temperatures between 0 °C and the<br>
reflux temperature of tetrahydrofuran (step b). Esters 1 can further be converted into<br>
tertiary alcohols 4 with R10 = R11 through reaction with alkyl organometallic reagents,<br>
preferably using alkyl Grignard compounds in a solvent like tetrahydrofuran or ether,<br>
preferably between -15 °C and the reflux temperature of the solvent (step c). Alkohols 4<br>
with R10 not equal to R11 can be prepared by a sequential procedure: i) saponification to<br>
the acid; ii) treatment with RloLi, optionally in the presence of a Cu(I) salt, in ether or<br>
tetrahydrofuran to yield the alkyl ketones -COR10; iii) subsequent reaction with RuLi or<br>
lithium aluminium hydride in ether or tetrahydrofuran (step c). Primary alcohols 2 can be<br>
oxidized to aldehydes 5 by methods known in the art, e. g. by treatment with pyridinium<br>
chlorochromate in dichloromethane, preferably at temperatures between room<br>
temperature and the reflux temperature of dichloromethane, or by treatment with<br>
manganese dioxide in solvents like dichloromethane, preferably at room temperature<br>
(step d). These aldehydes 5 can be converted to the corresponding secondary alcohols 6<br>
through reaction with alkyl organometallic compounds, preferably under the conditions<br>
given for the transformation of esters 1 to tertiary alcohols 4 (step e). Ketones 7 can be<br>
obtained from secondary alcohols 6 by methods known in the art, e. g. by treatment with<br>
Cr(VI) reagents like the Jones reagent (Jones et al., J. Chem. Soc. 1953, 2548.) (step f).<br>
These ketones 7 can be reduced back to the corresponding secondary alcohols 6 in an<br>
enantioselective fashion leading to the (R)- or (S)-alcohols 6, e. g. by treatment with<br>
borane-dimethylsulfide complex and (S)- or (R)-2-methyl-CBS-oxazaborolidine as chiral<br>
catalyst in tetrahydrofuran, preferably at temperatures between -78 °C and ambient<br>
temperature, according to Corey et al. (E. J. Corey, R. K. Bakshi, S. Shibata, J. Am.<br>
Chem. Soc. 1987, 109, 5551-5553), or by treatment with (+)- or (-)-Bchlorodiisopinocampheylborane<br>
(DIP-C1), according to Brown et al. (P. V.<br>
Ramachandran, B. Gong, A. V. Teodorovic, H. C. Brown, Tetrahedron: Asymmetry<br>
1994, 5, 1061-1074) (step g). Ketones 7 can in addition be converted to the<br>
corresponding tertiary alcohols 4 through reaction with alkyl organometallic compounds,<br>
preferably under the conditions given for the transformation of esters 1 to tertiary<br>
alcohols 4 in step c (step h). If the alcohol compounds 2, 4, or 6 contain one or more<br>
chiral centers and are not optically pure, they can optionally be separated into optically<br>
pure antipodes by methods well known in the art, e. g. chromatography on a chiral HPLC<br>
column, or by derivatization with an optically pure acid to form esters, which can then be<br>
separated by conventional HPLC chromatography and converted back to the original<br>
alcohol.<br>
The alcohol compounds 2, 4, and 6, and the halide compound 3, correspond to or<br>
can be converted into compounds of general formula 6 (scheme 1), e. g. by treatment<br>
with methanesulfonyl chloride in dichloromethane in the presence of a base like<br>
triethylamine preferably in a temperature range between -20 °C and room temperature,<br>
or e. g. by reaction with carbon tetrachloride or carbon tetrabromide and<br>
triphenylphosphine in solvents like tetrahydrofuran, preferably in a temperature range<br>
between room temperature and the reflux temperature of the solvents.<br>
Scheme 5<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
Pyrazole alkanols 1 with a chain length of n carbon atoms can be converted into<br>
analogues with a chain length of n+1 carbon atoms by methods well known in the art, e.<br>
g. by conversion of the primary alcohol function into a suitable leaving group, e. g. a<br>
halide (step a), reaction with cyanide ion (step b), saponification (step c) followed by<br>
reduction of the acid formed (compounds 4) to the primary alcohols 5, e. g. by using<br>
diborane in tetrahydrofuran (step d). In order to introduce substituents R10 and/or R"<br>
different from hydrogen, cyano intermediates 3 of this elongation process can be reacted<br>
with alkyl Grignard reagents R10MgX in solvents like ether or tetrahydrofuran between 0<br>
°C and the reflux temperature of the solvent to form the corresponding RIOCO- alkyl<br>
ketones, which upon treatment with an alkyllithium reagent RuLi or lithium aluminum<br>
hydride in solvents like ether or tetrahydrofuran give alcohols 5. RIOCO- alkyl ketones<br>
can also be reduced, e. g. by treatment with sodium borohydride in alcohol, preferably at<br>
temperatures between -15 °C and 40 °C. This reaction can also be carried out in an<br>
enantioselective fashion leading to the (R)- or (S)-alcohols 5, e. g. by treatment with<br>
borane-dimethylsulfide complex and (S)- or (R)-2-methyl-CBS-oxazaborolidine as chiral<br>
catalyst in tetrahydrofuran, preferably at temperatures between -78 °C and ambient<br>
temperature according to Corey et al. (E. J. Corey, R. K. Bakshi, S. Shibata, J. Am.<br>
Chem. Soc. 1987, 109, 5551-5553), or by treatment with (+)- or (-)-Bchlorodiisopinocampheylborane<br>
(DIP-C1), according to Brown et al. (P. V.<br>
Ramachandran, B. Gong, A. V. Teodorovic, H. C. Brown, Tetrahedron: Asymmetry<br>
1994, 5, 1061-1074). Alternatively, alcohol compounds 5 which contain one or more<br>
chiral centers can optionally be separated into optically pure antipodes by methods well<br>
known in the art, e. g. chromatography on a chiral HPLC column, or by derivatization<br>
with an optically pure acid to form esters, which can then be separated by conventional<br>
HPLC and converted back to the original alcohol. The alcohol compounds 5 correspond<br>
to or can be transformed into compounds of general formula 6 (scheme 1), e. g. by<br>
treatment with methanesulfonyl chloride in dichloromethane in the presence of a base<br>
like triethylamine, preferably in a temperature range between -20 °C and room<br>
temperature, or e. g. by reaction with carbon tetrachloride or carbon tetrabromide and<br>
triphenylphosphine in solvents like tetrahydrofuran, preferably in a temperature range<br>
between room temperature and the reflux temperature of the solvents.<br>
Scheme 6<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
lcohols 1 (compounds 6 with R14 = H and R16= OH in scheme 1, compounds 7 and 8<br>
with R14 = H in scheme 3, compounds 2, 4 and 6 with R14 = H in scheme 4, compounds 1<br>
and 5 with R14 = H in scheme 5) can be protected by methods known in the literature, e.<br>
g. by treating them with tert-butyldimethylsilyl chloride in the presence of imidazole,<br>
preferably at room temperature in solvents like N,N-dimethylformamide, to obtain the<br>
corresponding tert-butyldimethylsilyl ethers 2 (step a). Halogenation of protected<br>
pyrazoles 2, e. g. through reaction with bromine preferably at temperatures between 0 °C<br>
and ambient temperature in solvents like dichloromethane delivers 4-halo pyrazoles 3<br>
(step b). Compounds 3 can - following halogen metal exchange, preferably with tertbutyllithium<br>
at -78 °C in solvents like tetrahydrofuran - be reacted with alkylating<br>
reagents 4 with X e. g. being a chlorine, bromine or iodine atom, preferably with alkyl<br>
iodides, at temperatures between -78 °C and ambient temperature in solvents like<br>
tetrahydrofuran, to form pyrazoles 5 bearing a substituent in position 4 (step c).<br>
Alternatively, transition metal catalyzed reactions can be used to transform 4-halo<br>
pyrazoles 3 into compounds 5, e. g. by treatment with a stannane (X being trialkyl<br>
stannyl) in the presence of a Pd(0) catalyst like [Pd2(dba)3] and triphenyl arsine at<br>
temperatures between 0 °C and the reflux temperature of the solvent in solvents like<br>
dioxane. Residues R14 can further be introduced by i) formylation of pyrazoles 2 through<br>
methods well known in the art, e. g. with phosphorus oxychloride and N,Ndimethylformamide<br>
preferably at temperatures between 0 °C and 100 °C; ii) subsequent<br>
transformation of the intermediate formyl pyrazole to 4-substituted pyrazoles 5, e. g.<br>
through reduction with sodium cyano borohydride in the presence of zinc iodide at<br>
temperatures between -78 °C and the reflux temperature of the solvent in solvents like<br>
diethyl ether (step d). O-Deprotection of compounds 5 leading to building blocks 6 can<br>
be performed by methods described in the literature, e. g. by treatment with tetrabutyl<br>
ammonium fluoride at temperatures between -15 °C and ambient temperature in a<br>
solvent like tetrahydrofuran, if the protecting groups are silyl ethers (step e). The alcohol<br>
compounds 6 correspond to or can be transformed into compounds of general formula 6<br>
(scheme 1), e. g. by treatment with methanesulfonyl chloride in dichloromethane in the<br>
presence of a base like triethylamine, preferably in a temperature range between -20 °C<br>
and room temperature, or e. g. by reaction, with carbon tetrachloride or carbon<br>
tetrabromide and triphenylphosphine in solvents like tetrahydrofuran, preferably in a<br>
temperature range between room temperature and the reflux temperature of the solvents.<br>
The following tests were carried out in order to determine the activity of the<br>
compounds of formula (I).<br>

"Development of a scintillation proximity assay for peroxisome proliferator-activated<br>
receptor gamma ligand binding domain", (1998) A'nal. Biochem. 257: 112-119.<br>
Full-length cDNA clones for humans PPAR8 and PPARa and mouse PPARy were<br>
obtained by RT-PCR from human adipose and mouse liver cRNA, respectively, cloned<br>
into plasmid vectors and verified by DNA sequencing. Bacterial and mammalian<br>
expression vectors were constructed to produce glutathione-s-transferase (GST) and Gal4<br>
DNA binding domain proteins fused to the ligand binding domains (LBD) of PPAR5 (aa<br>
139 to 442), PPARy (aa 174 to 476) and PPARa (aa 167 to 469). To accomplish this, the<br>
portions of the cloned sequences encoding the LBDs were amplified from the full-length<br>
clones by PCR and then subcloned into the plasmid vectors. Final clones were verified by<br>
DNA sequence analysis.<br>
Induction, expression, and purification of GST-LBD fusion proteins were<br>
performed in E. coli strain BL21(pLysS) cells by standard methods (Ref: Current<br>

Luciferase Transcriptional Reporter Gene Assays<br>
Baby hamster kidney cells (BHK21 ATCC CCL10) were grown in DMEM<br>
medium containing 10% FBS at 37 °C in a 95%O2:5%CO2 atmosphere. Cells were<br>
seeded in 6 well plates at a density of 105 Cells/well and then batch-transfected with<br>
either the pFA-PPAR5-LBD, pFA-PPARy-LBD or pFA-PPARa-LBD expression<br>
plasmids plus a reporter plasmid. Transfection was accomplished with the Fugene 6<br>
reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the suggested protocol. Six hours<br>
following transfection, the cells were harvested by trypsinization and seeded in 96 well<br>
plates at a density of 104 cells/well. After 24 hours to allow attachment of cells, the<br>
medium was removed and replaced with 100 ul of phenol red-free medium containing<br>
the test substances or control ligands (final DMSO concentration: 0.1%). Following<br>
incubation of the cells for 24 hours with substances, 50 u.1 of the supernatant was was<br>
Biochemicals) to lyse the cells and initiate the luciferase reaction was added.<br>
Luminescence for luciferase was measured in a Packard TopCount. Transcriptional<br>
activation in the presence of a test substance was expressed as fold-activation over cells<br>
incubated in the absence of the substance. EC50 values were calculated using the XLfit<br>
program (ID Business Solutions Ltd. UK).<br>
The free acids of the compounds of the present invention (R1 is hydrogen) exhibit<br>

values of 1 nM to 10 ^iM , preferably 10 nM to 5 u,M for PPARa. Compounds, in which<br>
R1 is not hydrogen are converted in vivo to compounds in which R1 is hydrogen. The<br>
following table 1 shows measured values for some selected compounds of the present<br>

(Table Removed)<br>
The compounds of formula (I) and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts and<br>
esters can be used as medicaments, e.g. in the form of pharmaceutical preparations for<br>
enteral, parenteral or topical administration. They can be administered, for example,<br>
perorally, e.g. in the form of tablets, coated tablets, dragees, hard and soft gelatine<br>
capsules, solutions, emulsions or suspensions, rectally, e.g. in the form of suppositories,<br>
parenterally, e.g. in the form of injection solutions or infusion solutions, or topically, e.g.<br>
in the form of ointments, creams or oils.<br>
The production of the pharmaceutical preparations can be effected in a manner<br>
which will be familiar to any person skilled in the art by bringing the described<br>
compounds of formula (I) and their pharmaceutically acceptable, into a galenical<br>
administration form together with suitable, non-toxic, inert, therapeutical ly compatible<br>
solid or liquid carrier materials and, if desired, usual pharmaceutical adjuvants.<br>
Suitable carrier materials are not only inorganic carrier materials, but also organic<br>
carrier materials. Thus, for example, lactose, corn starch or derivatives thereof, talc,<br>
stearic acid or its salts can be used as carrier materials for tablets, coated tablets, dragees<br>
and hard gelatine capsules. Suitable carrier materials for soft gelatine capsules are, for<br>
example, vegetable oils, waxes, fats and semi-solid and liquid polyols (depending on the<br>
nature of the active ingredient no carriers are, however, required in the case of soft<br>
gelatine capsules). Suitable carrier materials for the production of solutions and syrups<br>
are, for example, water, polyols, sucrose, invert sugar and the like. Suitable carrier<br>
materials for injection solutions are, for example, water, alcohols, polyols, glycerol and<br>
vegetable oils. Suitable carrier materials for suppositories are, for example, natural or<br>
hardened oils, waxes, fats and semi-liquid or liquid polyols. Suitable carrier materials for<br>
topical preparations are glycerides, semi-synthetic and synthetic glycerides, hydrogenated<br>
oils, liquid waxes, liquid paraffins, liquid fatty alcohols, sterols, polyethylene glycols and<br>
cellulose derivatives.<br>
Usual stabilizers, preservatives, wetting and emulsifying agents, consistencyimproving<br>
agents, flavour-improving agents, salts for varying the osmotic pressure,<br>
buffer substances, solubilizers, colorants and masking agents and antioxidants come into<br>
consideration as pharmaceutical adjuvants.<br>
The dosage of the compounds of formula (I) can vary within wide limits depending<br>
on the disease to be controlled, the age and the individual condition of the patient and the<br>
mode of administration, and will, of course, be fitted to the individual requirements in<br>
each particular case. For adult patients a daily dosage of about 1 mg to about 1000 mg,<br>
especially about 1 mg to about lOOmg, comes into consideration. Depending on the<br>
dosage it is convenient to administer the daily dosage in several dosage units.<br>
The pharmaceutical preparations conveniently contain about 0.1-500 mg,<br>
preferably 0.5-100 mg, of a compound of formula (I).<br>
The following examples serve to illustrate the present invention in more detail.<br>
They are, however, not intended to limit its scope in any manner.<br>
