				<td>The invention relates to a method for operating a spinning<br>
device in accordance with the dosclosure heneunder<br>
In the case of centrifugal spinning a feed material, for<br>
example a sliver stored in a sliver can or a roving<br>
disposed on a speed frame bobbin, is firstly drawn by means<br>
of a drafting arrangement to a desired yarn fineness and<br>
then is conveyed via an axially displaceably mounted thread<br>
guide tube into a spinning centrifuge rotating at high<br>
speed. The drawn feed material emerging from the mouth of<br>
the thread guide tube is at the same time laid against the<br>
inner wall of the spinning centrifuge, with the formation<br>
of a yarn thread, and is entrained by it. This means that<br>
the fibre material obtains a rotation by the rotation of<br>
the spinning centrifuge, so that a thread is formed. The<br>
thread produced by the rotation is deposited by the axially<br>
displaceably mounted thread guide tube on the inner wall of<br>
the centrifuge and forms a yarn package there, which is<br>
also called a spinning cake.<br>
In the case of the so-called single-step spinning, the<br>
centrifugal speed and the delivery speed of the feed<br>
material are matched to one another so that the thread<br>
deposited as spinning cake already has its complete<br>
rotation and in a following operating cycle can be<br>
preferably rewound onto a re-reeling sleeve kept ready on<br>
the thread guide tube. The spinning cop produced during<br>
this re-reeling operation is then doffed and subsequently<br>
re-reeled on a bobbin winding machine following in the<br>
production sequence with further spinning cops to form a<br>
large-volume cross-wound bobbin.<br>
The known centrifugal spinning devices may in this case<br>
significantly differ, for example with respect to the shape<br>
of their spinning centrifuges.<br>
From DE 198 02 656 Al, for example, is known a centrifugal<br>
spinning device which comprises a tubular spinning<br>
centrifuge, i.e. it is open at the top and bottom. From<br>
above a thread guide tube, on which a re-reeling sleeve is<br>
displaceably kept ready, engages from above into the<br>
spinning centrifuge. The centrifugal spinning element is<br>
supported via a permanent magnet bearing and is supplied by<br>
an electromagnetic drive. With such tubular spinning<br>
centrifuges the electromagnetic drive is as a rule disposed<br>
between the bearings.<br>
Furthermore, centrifugal spinning devices having a so <br>
called pot centrifuge are known from DE 42 06 031 C2, DE 44<br>
26 897 Al or DE 42 36 37 6 Al, for example.<br>
With these known centrifugal spinning devices, the thread<br>
guide tube is passed through the centrifuge neck and, as<br>
customary, can be traversed and simultaneously be axially<br>
displaced in the direction of a lower centrifuge opening.<br>
With such centrifugal spinning devices the re-reeling<br>
sleeve is introduced through the centrifuge opening placed<br>
at the bottom into the spinning centrifuge. Since such pot<br>
centrifuges are only accessible from underneath, it has to<br>
be ensured that the spinning cake deposited on the inner<br>
wall of the spinning centrifuge is accessible or remains<br>
doffable at any time, i.e. after a thread breakage during<br>
spinning and also after a lap breakage during re-reeling.<br>
As can be seen, for example, from the drawings of DE 42 36<br>
376 Al or DE 44 26 897 Al, in such pot spinning devices<br>
work is generally carried out with speed frame winding. In<br>
other words, the spinning cake deposited by means of the<br>
thread guide tube on the inner wall of the pot centrifuge<br>
comprises a winding in the manner of a speed frame bobbin.<br>
Such a speed frame winding has the advantage, on account of<br>
its structure, that it remains accessible after a thread<br>
breakage during the spinning process or after a lap<br>
breakage during the re-reeling operation. The produced<br>
spinning cops often give rise to difficulties during<br>
subsequent operating processes since the postconnected<br>
cross-wound bobbins are as a rule designed for using ring<br>
spinning cops.<br>
Proceeding from the above-mentioned prior art, the object<br>
of the invention is to develop a method for operating a<br>
centrifugal spinning device which ensures that a yarn<br>
package can be produced in the event of a thread breakage<br>
during the spinning process and also in the event of a lap<br>
breakage during the re-reeling process and can be doffed,<br>
which can subsequently be further processed by automatic<br>
cheese winders.<br>
This object is achieved in accordance with the invention by a method as<br>
described later.<br>
The method according to the invention has the particular advantage that it<br>
reliably prevents a yarn chord being accidentally caught and as a result a re-<br>
reeling operation being initiated in an uncontrolled manner, in particular after a<br>
thread breakage during the spinning process, since a re-reeling operation<br>
initiated in an uncontrolled manner results at least in an unusable spinning cop,<br>
and often even in damage to the centrifugal spinning machine. Moreover, the<br>
yarn package rewound onto the re-reeling sleeve always has a predetermined<br>
position on the re-reeling sleeve, irrespective of the time when the re-reeling<br>
operation was initiated, which is extremely advantageous, in particular with<br>
respect to the subsequent further processing of the spinning cops in the<br>
preparatory stations of the automatic cheese winders.<br>
In an advantageous embodiment of the invention it is also provided, that the<br>
re-reeling sleeve is lowered to initiate a re-reeling operation at a feed<br>
speed which is matched to the vertical unwinding speed of the thread<br>
deposited as yarn cake. This means that the feed of there re-reeling sleeve<br>
is greater than the vertical unwinding speed of the thread. In this<br>
manner it is ensured that the yarn cake can be completely rewound on<br>
the re-reeling sleeve and in a later operation can be unwound again.<br>
The vertical unwinding speed of the thread can be influenced in different ways<br>
via the trasversing motion of the thread guide tube.<br>
In a preferred embodiment described herein, it is provided, for example, that the<br>
introduction of the thread guide tube into the re-reeling position takes place at a<br>
traversing speed which is significantly lower than the traversing speed of the<br>
thread guide tube during the regular spinning process. In connection with a<br>
corresponding fast feed of the re-reeling sleeve, it is in this manner guaranteed<br>
that the yarn package is properly re-reeled from the beginning onto the re-<br>
reeling sleeve with a predetermined yarn volume is reached, i.e. at the end of a<br>
regular spinning process.<br>
Alternative possibilities of influencing the vertical unreeling speed of the thread<br>
by the appropriate displacement of the thread guide tube into the re-reeling<br>
position are described respectively.<br>
It is also provided, for example, that the thread guide tube is displaced at<br>
"normal" traversing speed into the re-reeling position and then stays in this<br>
position for a while. This means that the feed of there-reeling tube is initiated<br>
with a time delay.<br>
A time-delayed initiation of the feed of the re-reeling sleeve is also provided in<br>
the embodiment described herein. Here too the thread guide tube is firstly<br>
displaced at "normal" traversing speed into the re-reeling position, but then in<br>
this region performs a few short traversing travels have a positive effect on the<br>
deposition of the thread, i.e. the deposited thread layers can be unwound very<br>
easily.<br>
In an advantageous embodiment it I also provided that, when introduced into<br>
the re-reeling position, the re-reeling sleeve is displaced by a distance which,<br>
comprises the height of the winding cone of the yarn package, the setback of the<br>
re-reeling sleeve and also the length of the unwound end of the re-reelling<br>
sleeve.<br>
The distance by which the re-reeling sleeve is displaced to initiate the re-reeling<br>
operation is advantageously roughly 50 mm. As already stated above, this 50<br>
mm is produced from the so-called setback of the re-reeling sleeve, the height of<br>
the winding cone of the yarn package and also the length of the free, unwound<br>
sleeve end. In other words, with a sleeve feed of roughly 50 mm a sufficient<br>
safety distance of the fixed re-reeling sleeve can be achieved in relation to the<br>
rotating yarn thread and also it is guaranteed by the free sleeve end that the<br>
spinning cop remains easy to operate in subsequent operations. The spinning<br>
cops designed in such a manner can be operated by inner grippers and also by<br>
outer grippers.<br><br>
minus twice a end safety distance of for example 5 mm<br>
respectively.<br>
In this case the safety distances primarily guarantee a<br>
safe deposition of the yarn cake on the inner wall of the<br>
centrifugal spinning element. The minimum length of the<br>
re-reeling sleeve is correspondingly calculated from the<br>
maximum length of the yarn package plus the length of the<br>
two free, unwound sleeve ends.<br>
To prevent, upon the occurrence of a thread breakage, the<br>
thread guide tube or the re-reeling sleeve being able to<br>
detect a thread chord and at the same time being able to<br>
initiate a re-reeling operation in an uncontrolled manner,<br>
it is also provided, that the<br>
traversing speed of the thread guide tube is matched to the<br>
reaction time of the sensor detecting a thread breakage.<br>
This means that the reaction time of the sensor has to be<br>
dimensioned so that it is ensured that in the event of a<br>
thread breakage the thread guide tube performs a traversing<br>
motion in the direction of the re-reeling position before<br>
the lower end of the re-reeling sleeve reaches the region<br>
of the thread breakage.<br>
Further details can be gathered from the exemplified<br>
embodiments explained below with reference to the/drawings.<br>
Therein:<br>
Figure l shows, in side view, a centrifugal<br>
spinning machine as used to perform the<br>
method according to the invention,<br>
Figures 2A to 2E shows the individual method steps when<br>
rewinding a yarn package at the end of<br>
a regular spinning process,<br>
Figures 3A to 3E show the individual method steps when<br>
rewinding a yarn package after a thread<br>
breakage that occurred during the<br>
spinning process,<br>
 Figures 4A to 4C show various refinements of the<br>
sequence of the displacement of the<br>
thread guide tube into the re-reeling<br>
position by using a path-time diagram.<br>
Figure 1 diagrammatically shows a first embodiment of a<br>
centrifugal spinning device 1, as may avantageously be<br>
used to perform the method according to the invention.<br>
The centrifugal spinning device 1 comprises a centrifugal<br>
spinning element 3 in the form of a so-called pot<br>
centrifuge.<br>
The centrifugal spinning element 3 rotating in a spinning<br>
housing 2 is supported in bearings 4 and is driven by a<br>
single motor via an electromagnetic drive 5. In the shown<br><br>
embodiment, the bearings 5 are constructed as magnet<br>
bearings, preferably as permanent magnet bearings.<br>
As can be seen from Figure 1, the neck region of the pot<br>
centrifuge is penetrated by a traversing and simultaneously<br>
axially downwardly displaceable thread guide tube 7. For<br>
this purpose, the thread guide tube 7 that can be<br>
introduced into the centrifugal spinning element is<br>
connected to a drive 8 that is only diagrammatically<br>
indicated in the figures. The thread guide tube 7 performs<br>
a traversing travel 30, i.e. the thread guide tube 7 is<br>
traversed respectively between the upper and lower dead<br>
centres 24A and 24B respectively and in so doing is axially<br>
displaced. Displaceably mounted on the thread guide tube 7<br>
is a re-reeling sleeve 9, which, for example, is connected<br>
to the hollow piston rod of a pneumatic cylinder 10 that<br>
surrounds the thread guide tube 7 and can be controlled in<br>
a defined manner. The re-reeling sleeve 9 is fixed via the<br>
pneumatic cylinder with respect to the thread guide tube 7<br>
in a position of rest 33 during the normal spinning process<br>
and can be moved into a re-reeling position 34 to initiate<br>
the rewinding operation, as will be explained in further<br>
detail below.<br>
Instead of the pot centrifuge, the centrifugal spinning<br>
device 1 can also comprise a tubular spinning centrifuge,<br>
as shown, for example, in Figures 2A, 2B and 3A, 3B.<br>
Such an embodiment also comprises a thread guide tube 7,<br>
which engages from above into the tubular spinning<br>
centrifuge 3. Displaceably disposed on the thread guide<br><br>
tube is, as known, a re-reeling sleeve 9. The re-reeling<br>
sleeve 9 is positioned in its position of rest 33 on the<br>
thread guide tube 7 so that the lower edge 11 of the re-<br>
reeling sleeve 9 is slightly set back in relation to the<br>
mouth 12 of the thread guide tube 7. This distance,<br>
denoted below as the sleeve setback 21, is preferably<br>
roughly 5 nun.<br>
Both embodiments of a centrifugal spinning device 1 also<br>
have a sensor device 13 or 13A for detecting a thread<br>
breakage and also a thread release device 14 for initiating<br>
an external rewinding operation. The sensor device 13 or<br>
13A is respectively connected to a control unit 19<br>
belonging to the spinning station via a signal line 20 or<br>
20A respectively. Depending on the embodiment, the sensor<br>
device 13 is either disposed beneath the drafting<br>
arrangement 6 and then monitors the moving feed material 18<br>
or the sensor device 13A is positioned, as indicated by<br>
broken lines, beneath the centrifugal spinning element and<br>
then monitors the rotation of the rotating yarn thread 28.<br>
In such a case the sensor device 13A is constructed as a<br>
photoelectric sensor, for example.<br>
Furthermore, a thread release device 14 is provided for the<br>
external initiation of a rewinding operation. The thread<br>
release device 14 is used, for example, after a thread<br>
breakage during the spinning process or after a lap<br>
breakage during the re-reeling operation and has a drive<br>
23, which enables a displacement of the thread release<br>
element 14 parallel to the inner wall 25 of the centrifuge.<br>
The thread release element 14 has a cutting edge 16 that<br><br>
can be placed at the winding cone 22 of the yarn package 15<br>
and also a thread guide contour 17 gripping over the<br>
cutting edge 16 in the axial direction.<br>
A sliver drafting device, for example a drafting<br>
arrangement 6, is respectively disposed above the<br>
centrifugal spinning element 3. A sliver is either<br>
supplied to this drafting arrangement 6 from a sliver can<br>
(not shown) or a feed material is supplied to said drafting<br>
arrangement 6 from a speed frame bobbin (not shown either).<br>
The correspondingly drafted feed material 18 is at the same<br>
time conveyed into the interior of the centrifugal spinning<br>
element 3, where it, with the formation of a rotating yarn<br>
thread 28, is applied to the inner wall 25 of the rotating<br>
centrifugal spinning element 3 and in so doing obtains a<br>
rotation.<br>
The thread produced by the rotation is positioned by the<br>
thread guide tube 7 on the inner wall 25 of the centrifugal<br>
spinning element 3 so that a defined yarn package, a so-<br>
called spinning cake 15, is produced. During the<br>
establishment of the yarn package 15, which begins in the<br>
region of the bottom 26 of the centrifugal spinning element<br>
3, the thread guide tube 7 is moved up and down in<br>
oscillating fashion via the drive 8. At the same time the<br>
thread guide tube 7 is continuously lowered in the<br>
direction of the centrifuge opening 17 via the drive 8.<br>
The spun thread is as a result deposited on the inner wall<br>
25 of the centrifugal spinning element 3 in the manner of a<br>
so-called cop winding.<br><br>
If the yarn package 15 has reached a predetermined size or<br>
if a thread breakage occurs during the spinning process, a<br>
re-reeling process is initiated in accordance with the<br>
invention by the following methods:<br>
With a regular spinning end, the method indicated in<br>
Figures 2A TO 2E takes place, whereas in the event of a<br>
thread breakage during the spinning process the method<br>
shown in Figures 3A to 3E is used.<br>
With a regular spinning end, the last yarn layer of the<br>
yarn package 15 is always laid by the thread guide tube 7<br>
being displaced from the position indicated in Figure 2A in<br>
the region of the lower edge 29 of the winding cone 22 of<br>
the yarn package 15, which is identical with the last<br>
bottom dead centre 24A of the traversing travel 30, to the<br>
upper dead centre 24B of the traversing travel 30.<br>
This last upward traversing motion 32 of the thread guide<br>
tube 7 indicated in Figure 4A by means of a path-time<br>
diagram preferably has a significantly lower traversing<br>
speed than the traversing speed of the thread guide tube 7<br>
customary during the "normal" spinning process. As soon as<br>
the thread guide tube 7 has reached the upper dead centre<br>
24B, which in this case is identical with the re-reeling<br>
position 31, the re-reeling process is started. In other<br>
words, the re-reeling sleeve 9 fixed on the thread guide<br>
tube 7 in a position of rest 33 is pushed into its re-<br>
reeling position 34 by appropriate control of the pneumatic<br>
cylinder 10. During the relatively fast sleeve feed, the<br>
lower edge 11 of the re-reeling sleeve 9 firstly brushes<br><br>
over the region of the sleeve setback 21, then is pushed<br>
beyond the mouth 12 of the thread guide tube 7 and reaches<br>
the region of the lower, free sleeve end 35 of the re-<br>
reeling sleeve 9, after the height of the winding cone 22<br>
of the yarn package 15 has been passed.<br>
During this action the re-reeling sleeve 9 catches by its<br>
lower edge 11 the rotating yarn thread 28, which triggers<br>
the re-reeling process. In other words, the spinning cake<br>
15 deposited on the inner wall 25 of the centrifugal<br>
spinning element 3 with an upper (39) and a lower (39A)<br>
safety distance is rewound onto the re-reeling sleeve 9, as<br>
indicated in Figures 2C and 2D, with the winding operation<br>
always taking place in the region of the upwardly moving<br>
winding cone 22. As the first winding layer is firstly<br>
unwound towards the free sleeve end 35, the feed speed of<br>
the re-reeling sleeve 9 has to be greater in the region of<br>
the winding cone 22 than the axial unwinding speed of the<br>
thread.<br>
After the yarn package 15 has been completely re-wound onto<br>
the re-reeling sleeve 9 and as a result a spinning cop 36<br>
has been produced, the spinning cop 36 is moved by axial<br>
displacement of the thread guide tube 7 to a stop 37, which<br>
defines the doffing position of the spinning cop 36, as<br>
shown in Figure 2E.<br>
The spinning cop 36 can then be conveyed further by means<br>
of a transport device 38, only diagrammatically indicated<br>
in Figure 3E, to a textile machine (not shown) that is<br><br>
postconnected in the production process, preferably a<br>
bobbin winding machine.<br>
The method according to the invention proceeds in a similar<br>
manner when a thread breakage occurs during the spinning<br>
process, which is indicated in Figures 3A - 3E.<br>
Such a thread breakage is detected immediately by the<br>
sensor device 13 and is reported to the control unit 19 via<br>
the signal line 20. The control unit 19 then ensures that<br>
firstly the further supply of feed material 18 is stopped<br>
and secondly the drive 8 of the thread guide tube 7 is<br>
controlled in such a manner that the thread guide tube 7<br>
passes immediately into an upward traversing motion 32 or,<br>
if at the time of the thread breakage an upward traversing<br>
motion exists, this is retained. As soon as the thread<br>
guide tube 7 then has reached the re-reeling position 31,<br>
in this case too the traversing of the thread guide tube 7,<br>
for example, is also ended. To prevent a chord caused by<br>
the thread breakage being caught in uncontrolled manner by<br>
the thread guide tube 7 or the re-reeling sleeve 8 and thus<br>
a damaging re-reeling operation being able to be started,<br>
the downward traversing speed of the thread guide tube 7<br>
and also the sleeve setback 21 are matched to the reaction<br>
time of the sensor device 13 or 13A respectively. This<br>
means that it is ensured that the lower end of the re-<br>
reeling sleeve 9 does not get lowered to the level of the thread<br>
breakage by the traversing.<br>
Then the re-reeling sleeve 9 is pushed into its re-reeling<br>
position by means of the pneumatic cylinder 10 and the<br>
thread release element 14 is introduced from below into the<br>
centrifugal spinning element 3, as represented in Figure<br>
3C.<br>
As soon as the cutting edge 16 of the thread release<br>
element 14 touches the winding cone 22 of the spinning cake<br>
15 deposited at the inner wall 25 of the centrifugal<br>
spinning element 3, this is re-reeled onto the re-reeling<br>
sleeve 9 on account of the rotation of the centrifugal<br>
spinning element 3. The thread guide contour 17 on the<br>
thread release element 14 prevents the thread release<br>
element 14 also being accidentally rewound.<br>
After the thread release element 14 was withdrawn, the<br>
spinning cop 36, as indicated in Figure 3E, is moved by<br>
moving the thread guide tube 7 to a stop 37 into a doffing<br>
position in which the spinning cop 36 can be taken over by<br>
a transport device 38 and can be transported away for<br>
further processing.<br>
The invention is not restricted to the exemplified<br>
embodiments described above. Rather, further embodiments<br>
can be envisaged within the scope of the general concept of<br>
the invention.<br>
For example, it is altogether possible, even with a regular<br>
spinning end, to move the thread guide tube 7 at "normal"<br>
traversing speed into the upper dead centre 31, then to<br>
stop the traversing and with the introduction of the re-<br>
reeling sleeve 9 into the re-reeling position 34 to wait<br>
slightly, as indicated in Figure 4C.<br><br>
Another refinement indicated in Figure 4B provides moving<br>
the last upward traversing motion 32 of the thread guide<br>
tube 7 at "normal" traversing speed and subsequently adding<br>
some additional, short traversing travels 40 in the region<br>
of the upper dead centre.<br>
18<br>
We claim:<br>
1. A method for operating a spinning device comprising a centrifugal<br>
spinning element rotating at high speed and also a thread guide tube dipping<br>
into the centrifugal spinning element having a re-reeling tube displacebly<br>
disposed on the thread guide tube, whereby the thread guide tube performs,<br>
relative to the centrifugal spinning element, a traversing travel and a<br>
superimposed advancing movement downwards and in so doing deposits a yarn<br>
package with a cop winding on the inner wall of the centrifugal spinning element<br>
characterized in that<br>
before introducing the rewinding process, the thread guiding tube (7) is brought<br>
by a drive (8) to a rewinding position (31) that is respectively dependant on the<br>
last lower dead point of the traverse stroke of the thread guiding tube (7),<br>
whereby the last traverse stroke of the thread guider (7) always runs upwards in<br>
the direction of the rewinding position (31),<br>
after the thread guiding tube (7) is lower by a defined stretch;<br>
the stinking rewinding sleeve (9) introduces the rewinding process; and<br>
after completion of the rewinding process the thread guiding tube (7) is driven to<br>
pre-determined lower position and thereby the spinning cop (36) generated by<br>
the rewinding process is shifted to a defined doff position.<br><br>
2. A method as claimed in claim 1, wherein at least at the end of a regular<br>
spinning process the speed at which the re-reeling sleeve is lowered is matched<br>
to the vertical thread unwinding speed predetermined by the traversing motion<br>
of the thread guide tube.<br>
3. A method as claimed in claim 2, wherein the traversing motion of the<br>
thread guide tube takes place in the direction of the re-reeling position at a<br>
traversing speed which is significantly lower that a customary traversing speed<br>
during the spinning process.<br>
4. A method as claimed in claim 2, wherein the traversing motion of the<br>
thread guide tube in the direction of the re-reeling position takes place at regular<br>
traversing speed, in that the thread guide tube then stays in the region of the re-<br>
reeling position, and in that then, with a time delay, the feed of the re-reeling<br>
sleeve takes place to initiate the re-reeling process.<br><br>
5. A method as claimed in claim 2, wherein the traversing motion of the<br>
thread guide tube in the direction of the re-reeling position takes place at<br>
customary traversing speed, in that the thread guide tube then performs a few<br>
additional, short traversing travels in the region of the re-reeling and in a time<br>
delay the feed of the re-reeling sleeve takes place to initiate the re-reeling<br>
process.<br>
6. A method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the re-reeling sleeve is lowered<br>
by a distance for which the height of the winding cone of the yarn package, the<br>
setback of the re-reeling sleeve and also the length of the unwound lower end of<br>
the re-reeling sleeve is taken into consideration.<br>
7. A method as claimed in claim 6, wherein the distance preferably has a<br>
length of roughly 50 mm.<br>
8. A method as claimed in claim 6, wherein the re-reeling sleeve is lowered<br>
to such an extent that the lower edge of the re-reeling sleeve with respect to the<br>
lower edge of the winding cone of the yarn package always has a constant<br>
distance that determines the length of the lower, free sleeve end of the re-<br>
reeling sleeve.<br><br>
9. A method as claimed in claim 8, wherein the re-reeling sleeve is lowered<br>
so that the length of the lower, free sleeve end is roughly 15 mm.<br>
10. A method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the length of the yarn package is<br>
chosen so that it is optimally matched to the useable inner length of the<br>
centrifugal spinning element, with the necessary length of the re-reeling sleeve<br>
simultaneously being minimised.<br>
11. A method s claimed in claim 10, wherein a yarn package is established<br>
whose maximum length is the inner length of the centrifugal spinning element<br>
minus two safety distances at the end.<br>
12. A method as claimed in claim 11, wherein the length of the safety<br>
distances at the end is respectively roughly 5 mm.<br>
13. A method as claimed in claim 11, wherein a are-reeling sleeve is used, the<br>
length of which is produced from the maximum length of the yarn package plus<br>
two free sleeve ends at the ends.<br>
14. A method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the traversing speed of the<br>
thread guide tube, the reaction time of the sensor detecting a thread breakage<br>
and the setback of the re-reeling sleeve are matched to one another.<br>
A method for operating a spinning device comprising a centrifugal spinning<br>
element rotating at high speed and also a thread guide tube dipping into the<br>
centrifugal spinning element having a re-reeling tube displacebly disposed on the<br>
thread guide tube, whereby the thread guide tube performs, relative to the<br>
centrifugal spinning element, a traversing travel and a superimposed advancing<br>
