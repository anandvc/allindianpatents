DESCRIPTION<br>
OXAZOLE DERIVATIVES AS INHIBITORS OF CYCLOOXYGENASE<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
This invention relates to new compounds and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof having pharmacological activity.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Cyclooxygenase catalyzes early stage reaction of arachidonate cascade, which is very important for a living body.  For example, this cascade synthesizes prostaglandins as autacoids.  So, antagonists or agonists of cyclooxygenase can be expected as medicines for treatment and/or prevention of inflammatory conditions, and so on.<br>
As this cyclooxygenase , the presence of two isoenzymes , cyclooxygenase-I (COX-I) andcyclooxygenase-II (COX-II), is known (Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA, 68, pp.2692-2696 (1991)).  COX-I is always expressed over whole body and participates the maintenance of biological function at various tissues.  On the other hand, COX-II is not always expressed and is induced by tumor promoter, growth factor, cytokine, and the like.<br>
Among the antagonist of COX, traditional non steroidal anti -inflammatory compounds (NSAIDs) have inhibiting activities of both COX-I and COX-II (J. Biol. Chem., 268, pp.6610-6614 (1993), etc). So, the therapeutic use thereof can cause undesired effects on the gastrointestinal tract, such as bleeding, erosions, gastric and intestinal ulcers, etc.<br>
It was reported that selective inhibition of COX-II shows  anti-inflammatory  and  analgesic  activities<br><br>
DESCRIPTION	"1\TU^<br>
INHIBITOR OF COX<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
This invention relates to new compounds and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof having pharmacological activity.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Cyclooxygenase catalyzes early stage reaction of arachidonate cascade, which is very important for a living body.  For example, this cascade synthesizes prostaglandins as autacoids.  So, antagonists or agonists of cyclooxygenase can be expected as medicines for treatment and/or prevention of inflammatory conditions, and so on.<br>
As this cyclooxygenase, the presence of two isoenzymes , cyclooxygenase-I (COX-I) andcyclooxygenase-II (COX-II), is known (Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA, 88, pp.2692-2696 (1991)). COX-I is always expressed over whole body and participates the maintenance of biological function at various tissues. On the other hand, COX-II is not always expressed and is induced by tumor promoter, growth factor, cytokine, and the like.<br>
Among the antagonist of COX, traditional non steroidal anti-inflammatory compounds (NSAIDs) have inhibiting activities of both COX-I and COX-II (J. Biol. Chem. , 268, pp.6610-6614 (1993), etc). So, the therapeutic use thereof can cause undesired effects on the gastrointestinal tract, such as bleeding, erosions, gastric and intestinal ulcers, etc.<br>
It was reported that selective inhibition of COX-II shows  anti-inflammatory  and  analgesic  activities<br><br>
comparable with conventional NSAIDs but with a lower incidence of some gastrointestinalundesired effects (Pro. Nat.   Acad.   Sci.   USA,   91,   pp.3228-3232(1994)). Accordingly, various selective COX-II inhibitors have been prepared.<br>
However, it was also reported that those "selective COX-II inhibitors" show some side-effects on kidney and/or insufficient efficacy on acute pains. Therefore, some compounds such as SC-560, mofezolac, etc., which have certain selective inhibiting activity against COX-I, have been researched.<br>
WO98/57910 also shows some compounds having such selective activity. However, their selectivity of inhibiting COX-I does not seem to be enough to use them as a clinically acceptable and satisfactory analgesic agent due to their gastrointestinal disorders.<br>
And, WO02/055502 shows some pyridine derivatives having cyclooxygenase inhibiting activity, particularly cyclooxygenase-I inhibiting activity. WO99/51580 shows some triazole derivatives having an inhibiting activity of cytokine production, and WO03/040110 shows some triazole derivatives having cyclooxygenase inhibiting activity, particularly cyclooxygenase-I inhibiting activityâ€¢<br>
Further, WO92/21664, WO92/21665 and US4,051,250 show oxazole derivatives having anti/inframmatory activity.<br>
However, the compounds described in W092/21664 and W092/21665 have necessarily hydroxylamino group in their structure and the compouns described in US4,051,250 have alkyl thio group substituted by carboxy, ester, -CONH2 or CN group.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
As a result of studies on the synthes is of new compounds  and  their  pharmaceutical  activity,  the<br><br>
inventors of this invention have found that the new compounds of this invention have superior activity of inhibiting COX (especially, COX-I inhibiting activity).

In the above formula, R1 to R5, X, Y and "n" represent the same meanings as defined above. And Compound (II) may have either of following structure.<br><br>
Hereinafter, this condition is the same with Compound (III)# (IV), (VI) and (VII).<br>
Process A-l is the process for preparing Compound (I) from Compound (II) by forming oxazole ring.<br>
Compound (II) may be purchased if it is commercial, or synthesized according to Process B mentioned after or other general methods obvious to the person skilled in the organic chemistry from commercial compounds.<br>
As this process, two methods are mainly employable, which are one using phosphorus oxychloride (P0C13) as condensation agent {A-1(1)) and the other using triphenylphosphine (A-l(2) ) .<br>
Process A-l(l) is generally carried out by adding phosphorus oxychloride to the solution of Compound (II) .<br><br>
The temperature at that time to be employable depends on the startingmaterial, the solvent, etc. , but it is usually room temperature. And after adding, the temperature is preferably raised to reflux.<br>
The solvent employable in Process A-1(1) is not particularly limited so long as it is inactive in this reaction and dissolves moderately Compound (II) and phosphorus oxychloride- It may preferably include liquid hydrocarbon such as benzene, toluene.<br>
The reaction time after adding phosphorus oxychloride depends on the starting material, the solvent, etc. , but it is usually from 12hrs to 3days.<br>
Process A-l(2) is generally carried out by adding the solution of triphenylphosphine, iodine and base (triethylamine, etc.) to the solution of Compound (II). The temperature at that time depends on the starting material, the solvent, etc., but it is usually room temperature.<br>
The solvent employable in Process A-1(2) is not particularly limited so long as it is inactive in this reaction and can dissolve substrates moderately, and may preferably include halogenated hydrocarbon such as dichloromethane, chloroform, carbon tetrachloride.<br>
The reaction time after adding triphenylphosphine depends on the starting material, the solvent, etc., but it is usually from 12hrs to 3days.<br>
After the reaction, the mixture is partitioned between water and organic solvent insoluble with water such as ethyl acetate, chloroform, etc., and the organic layer is separated. The organic layer is washed by water, hydrochloric acid, saturated sodium hydrogenearbonate solution, brine, etc., dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate or sodium sulfate, and evaporated in vacuo. The target compound is purified by the conventional method such as silica gel column chromatography, etc. .<br><br>
Which to be selected A-l(l) or A-l ( 2 ) in this process ismainly dependent onthepropertyofR1 group. So, either method of which yield is higher may be employed.<br>
Compound (I) can be also synthesized by following Process A-2.<br><br>
In the above formula, R1 to R5, X, Y and "n" represent the same meanings as defined above.<br>
Process A-2 is the process for preparing Compound (I) from Compound (III) by forming oxazole ring besides Process A-1.<br>
Compound (III) may be purchased if it is commercial, or synthesized according to Process C mentioned after or other general methods obvious to the person skilled in the organic chemistry from commercial compounds *<br>
This process is generally carried out by adding ammonium acetate to the acetic acid solution of Compound (III) . The temperature at that time depends on the starting material, the solvent, etc., but it is usually room temperature . And after adding ammonium acetate , the temperature is preferably raised to reflux.<br>
The reaction time after adding ammonium acetate depends on the starting material, the solvent, etc. , but it is usually from 30min to 12hrs, preferably from lhr to 5hrs.<br>
After the reaction, the solvent is removed in vacuo.<br><br>
and acetic acid is azeotropically removed with toluene, etc.. The residue is partitioned between water and organic solvent insoluble with water such as ethyl acetate , chloroform, etc. , andthe organic layer is separated. The organic layer is washed by water, saturated sodium hydrogencarbonate solution, brine, etc. , dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate or sodium sulfate, and evaporated in vacuo. The target compound is purified by the conventional method such as silica gel column chromatography, etc..<br>
Compound (I) can be transformed to the other Compound (I) by functional group trans formation, which is obvious to the person skilled in the organic chemi stry. For example, first. Process A- 1 or A-2 are carried out by using the compound which does not have reactive group as R1 and the like, then, the R1 and the like are transformed to reactive group. Some of such functional group trans formation reactions are illustrated as following Process A- 3 .<br><br><br>
In the above formulae, R represents H, lower alkyl or aryl, which is not specified, and plural R may be same or different each other- "Ms" represents methanesulfonyl group. And R4 represents the same meanings as defined above.<br>
Compound (II), which is the starting compound of Process A-l, can be synthesized by following Process B.<br><br><br>
In the above formula, R1 represents the same meanings as defined above. And "Hal" represents halogen atom, especially, chlorine or bromine atom.<br>
Process B is the process for preparing the Compound (II) by condensing Compound (IV) and (V).<br>
Compound (IV) and (V) may be purchased if it is commercial, or synthesized according to general methods obvious to the person skilled in the organic chemistry from commercial compounds . But, in advance. Compound (V) can be synthesized from corresponding acid and pivaloyl chloride or oxallyl chloride, or the like, in one-pot. And corresponding acid anhydride may be also used as Compound (V).<br>
This process is generally carried out by adding Compound (V) to the solution of Compound (IV).   To accelerate the reaction, base such as pyridine may be added. The temperature at that time depends on the starting<br>
material, the solvent, etc. , but it is usually 0Â°C to room temperature. And after adding, the temperature may be raised to reflux.<br>
The solvent employable in Process B is not particularly limited so long as it is inactive in this reaction and dissolves moderately substrates, and may include preferably halogenated hydrocarbon such as dichloromethane, chloroform; liquid hydrocarbon such as benzene, toluene; ethers such as diisopropyl ether , tetrahydrofuran, dioxane.<br>
The reaction time after the adding depends on the starting material, the solvent, etc., but it is usually from Ihr to 3days.<br>
After the reaction, the mixture is partitioned between water and organic solvent insoluble with water such as ethyl acetate, chloroform, etc. , and the organic layer is separated.  The organic layer is washed by water.<br><br>
hydrochloric acid, saturated sodium hydrogencarbonate solution, brine, etc., dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate or sodium sulfate, and evaporated in vacuo. The target compound is purified by the conventional method such as silica gel column chromatography, etc. . However, the target compound may be used in next step (Process A-l) without purification.<br>
Compound (III), which is the starting compound of Process A-2, can be synthesized by following Process C.<br><br>
In the above formulae, R1 and "Hal" represent the same meanings as defined above.<br>
Process C is the process for preparing the Compound (III) in the presence of base.<br>
Compound (V) to (VIII) may be purchased if it is commercial, or synthesized according to general methods obvious to the person skilled in the organic chemistry from commercial compounds, because their structure are comparatively simple.<br>
The above two processes may be generally carried out by almost same condition, that is, by mixing base and Compound (V) and (VI) or Compound (VII) and (VIII) in solvent.  The temperature at that time varies depending<br><br>
on the starting material, the solvent, etc., but it is usually room temperature.<br>
The solvent employable in Process C is not particularly limited so long as it is inactive in this reaction and dissolves moderately substrates, and may include preferably halogenated hydrocarbon such as dichloromethane, chloroform; ketone such as acetone, 2-butanone.<br>
The base employable in this process for making basic condition is not particularly limited so long as it accelerates this reaction and may include alkali metal carbonates such as lithium carbonate, sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate; alkaline earth metal carbonates such as magnesium carbonate, calcium carbonate; cesium carbonate; pyridine.<br>
The reaction time depends on the starting material, the solvent, etc. , but it is usually from 12hrs to 2days.<br>
After the reaction, the mixture is partitioned between water and organic solvent insoluble with water such as ethyl acetate, chloroform, etc*, and the organic layer is separated. The organic layer is washed by water, hydrochloric acid, saturated sodium hydrogencarbonate solution, brine, etc., dried over anhydrous magnes ium sulfate or sodium sulfate, and evaporated in vacuo. The target compound is purified by the conventional method such as silica gel column chromatography , etc . . However , the target compound may be used in next step (Process A-2) without purification.<br>
Compound (IV) , (VI) and (VII) have comparably simple structure. So, these compounds can be synthesized according to general methods obvious to the person skilled in the organic chemistry from commercial compounds. For example, these compounds can be synthesized by referring following Process D.<br><br><br>
Above Processes A to D, all starting materials and product compounds may be salts. The compounds of above processes can be converted to salt according to a conventional method.<br>
And above Processes A to D, compounds, which have reactive group, may be protected at the group on cue, and be deprotected on cue.

In order to illustrate the usefulness of the object compounds (I), the pharmacological test data of the compounds (I) are shown in the following.<br>
[A]  ANALGESIC ACTIVITY :<br>
Effect on adjuvant arthritis in rats :<br>
(i)  Test Method :<br>
Analgesic activity of a single dose of agents in arthritic rats was studied.<br>
Arthritis was induced by injection of 0.5 mg of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Difco Laboratories, Detroit, Mich.) in 50jiL of liquid paraffin into the right hind footpad of Lewis rats aged 7 weeks. Arthritic rats were randomized and grouped (n=10) for drug treatment based on pain threshold of left hind paws and body weight on day 22.<br>
Drugs (Test compounds) were administered and the pain threshold was measured 2hrs after drug administration. The intensity of hyperalgesia was assessed by the method of Randall - Selitto. The mechanical pain threshold of the left hind paw (uninjected hind paw) was determined by compressing the ankle joint with a balance pressure apparatus (Ugo Basile Co.Ltd., Varese, Italy). The threshold pressure of rats squeaking or struggling was expressed in grams. The threshold pressure of rats treated with drugs was compared with that of non-treated rats- A dose showing the ratio of 1.5 is considered to be the effective dose.<br><br><br>
[B]  Inhibiting activity against COX-I and COX-II<br>

Whole blood assay for COX-I<br>
Fresh blood was collected by syringe without anticoagulants from volunteers with consent. The subjects had no apparent inflammatory conditions and had not taken any medication for at least 7 days prior to blood collection.<br>
500pL Aliquots of human whole blood were immediately incubated with 2pL of either dimethyl sulfoxide vehicle<br>
or a test compound at final concentrations for lhr at 37Â°C to allow the blood to clot. Appropriate treatments (no incubation) were used as blanks. At the end of the incubation, 5pL of 250mM Indomethacin was added to stop the reaction.  The blood was centrifuged at 6000 x g for<br>
5min at 4Â°C to obtain serum. A 10 0-pL aliquot of serum was mixed with 400pL methanol for protein precipitation. The supernatant was obtained by centrifuging at 6000 x<br>
g for 5min at" 4Â°C and was assayed for TXB2 using an enzyme immunoas say kit according to the manufacturer rs procedure . For a test compound, the results were expressed as percent inhibition of thromboxane B2(TXB2) production relative to control incubations containing dimethyl sulfoxide<br><br>
vehicle.<br>
The data were analyzed by that a test compound at the indicated concentrations was changed log value and was applied simple linear regression, IC50 value was calculated by least squares method.<br>
Whole blood assay for COX-II<br>
Fresh blood was collected in heparinized tubes by syringe from volunteers with consent. The subjects had no apparent inflammatory conditions and had not taken any medication for at least 7 days prior to blood collection.<br>
500pL aliquots of human whole blood were incubated with either 2]iL dimethyl sulfoxide vehicle or 2pL of a<br>
test compound at final concentrations for 15 min at 37Â°C. This was followed by incubation of the blood with lOpL<br>
of 5mg/mL lipopolysaccharide for 24hrs at 37 Â°C for induction of COX-II.  Appropriate PBS treatments (no LPS)<br>
were used as blanks.  At the end of the incubation, the<br>
blood was centrifuged at 6000 x g for 5 min at 4Â°C to obtain plasma. A lOOpL aliquot of plasma was mixed with 400pL methanol for protein precipitation.  The supernatant was<br>
obtained by centrifuging at 6000Xg for 5min at 4Â°C and was assayed for prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) using a radioimmunoassay kit after conversion of PGE2 to its methyl oximate derivative according to the manufacturer's procedure.<br>
For a test compound, the results were expressed as percent inhibition of PGE2 production relative to control incubations containing dimethyl sulfoxide vehicle. The data were analyzed by that a test compound at the indicated concentrations was changed log value and was applied simple linear regression. IC50 value was calculated by least squares method.<br>
