METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR PROVIDING MUSIC-RELATED INFORMATION<br>
BY USING AUDIO DNA<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a method and system for<br>
providing music related information using audio gene, and more<br>
particularly, to a method and system for providing music related<br>
information using audio gene, capable of providing audio data<br>
files such as a music file with music information used to<br>
identify and itemize files over an on-line network such as<br>
Internet network and attaching music information to the files.<br>
Further, the present invention relates to a system capable<br>
of sorting the music files automatically and filing them in a<br>
hierarchical or directory structure using a method for providing<br>
music information by generating and transmitting the audio gene,<br>
with a function to generate music files and a function to<br>
recommend the optimal music to users.<br>
Further, the present invention provides a method to perform<br>
a calculation of a correct intellectual property by calculating<br>
a rental fee of music using the audio gene of music data which<br>
are reproduced, in the case that a music is reproduced using a<br>
function of a music reproduction player mounted in communication<br>
equipment such as a mobile phone.<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/126767	2	PCT/KR2005/004340<br>
Background Art<br>
Generally, music CDs store audio files together with music<br>
information on their titles of musical compositions, titles of<br>
albums, singers, track information, reproduction time<br>
simultaneously, the information being commonly referred to as<br>
Header information or Meta DataBase. Accordingly, in the case<br>
that a music CD is reproduced with a player such as a window<br>
media player or a dedicated player having a display window,<br>
music information such as a copyright, a track, a title of the<br>
musical composition and a name of singer with respect to an<br>
audio file being reproduced, that is, a music file is displayed<br>
at the same time, so that users are provided with information on<br>
the audio file. Therefore, when the music information itself is<br>
not stored, the music information is partially lost, or<br>
erroneous music information is stored, it is not possible to get<br>
information on the audio file being reproduced at all.<br>
Conventionally, since a piece of music CD stores music<br>
files of about 12 to 15 pieces of music at most, users have to<br>
replace the music CD frequently when he or she wishes to enjoy<br>
new music continuously. Accordingly, as to users, especially, as<br>
to users who use the music CD in a car, there are many<br>
inconveniences. More particularly, when users manipulate the<br>
music CD in the car, it may bring about accidents.<br>
However, as a data compression technology is gradually<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/126767	3	PCT/KR2005/004340<br>
developed, music files having wave format and audio files of all<br>
audio compression file formats such as MP3, ogg, aac and so on<br>
which are manufactured by compressing the music files are<br>
currently being provided. More particularly, MP3(MPEG Audio<br>
Layer-3) is a file format with which many audio files are<br>
provided. As such, when using music file of the MP3 format, a<br>
piece of CD can have about 130 to 250 pieces of musical<br>
compositions. Accordingly, many music CD owners convert music<br>
files stored in the music CD into music files of the wave format<br>
and all audio compression file formats such as MP3, ogg, aac and<br>
so on which are manufactured by compressing the music files and<br>
uses them. However, in the case that music files are converted<br>
into the music files of wave format and all audio compression<br>
files such as MP3, ogg, aac and so on which are manufactured by<br>
compressing them, header values stored in Meta DB of music CD<br>
are not converted simultaneously, it is not possible to identify<br>
information on the music file of the wave format and all audio<br>
compression file format such as MP3, ogg, aac and so on which '<br>
are manufactured by compressing them at all.<br>
Further, even in the case that the users download and use<br>
the music file of wave format and all audio compression file<br>
such as MP3, ogg, aac and so on which are manufactured by<br>
compressing them over Internet network for pay or free, there<br>
are also many cases in which there are not sufficient file<br>
information.<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/126767	PCT/KR2005/004340<br>
4<br>
Further, even in the case that the users record live music<br>
and convert them into music files of wave format and all audio<br>
compression file format such as MP3, ogg, aac and so on which<br>
are manufactured by compressing them, he or she has an<br>
inconvenience to manufacture ID3v2 tag files with respect to<br>
music and attach them directly.<br>
Accordingly, it is desirable to provide a method for<br>
automatically providing MP3 files having no correct music<br>
information on audio file data with music information data with<br>
respect to audio files and at the same time tagging the data to<br>
the files in ID3vl OR ID3v2 tag format and sorting the files<br>
automatically.<br>
As such, a method to identify all audio data files having<br>
no file data is described in Korean Patent No.456408 entitled<br>
"Audiogene generation method and audio data search method" filed<br>
on Feb. 6, 2004 by the same applicant and registered on Nov. 1,<br>
2004, incorporated herein by reference in their entity, the<br>
Patent describing that information on audio data file is<br>
provided using an ARS function of telephone.<br>
Meanwhile, as a development of semiconductor technology has<br>
been made, since a semiconductor laser has appeared, music is<br>
provided through CD instead of LP disc or magnetic tape, so that<br>
clearer quality of sound without noise can be obtained. However,<br>
even in the case that music is distributed through CD, it is not<br>
possible to record many music on a piece of CD. However, after<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/126767	5	PCT/KR2005/004340<br>
MPEG standardized MPEG-Audio Layer3 (hereinafter, referred to as<br>
MP3) which is a audio compression technology, there occurs many<br>
software which can generate MP3 files, so MP3 file reproduction<br>
device, so called MP3 players are widely used. Since music file<br>
manufactured by MP3 file is considerably small in its volume<br>
compared with music file provided by a common CD, many music<br>
files can be stored in a CD. Further, with a development of<br>
flash memory, MP3 dedicated player was developed which adapts<br>
the flash memory as storage medium. Currently, with a<br>
development of hard disk, MP3 players using mini hard disks are<br>
being produced. Further, with a large capacity and a development<br>
of circuit technology or software technology, many MP3 players<br>
which can also be used as mobile storage are being produced.<br>
Conventionally, in the case of using flash memories, most<br>
of their storage capacities are 125M to about 1G. In the case of<br>
using mini discs, their storage capacities reach to 20G<br>
currently. However, since there are many music files in the<br>
storage media, it is very difficult to find user desired music.<br>
Further, in order that users conveniently find their desired<br>
music, directories are formed in the MP3 player and then music<br>
is stored in a hierarchical structure, that is, directory<br>
structure. Therefore, it becomes easy to search for the stored<br>
music. However, it depends on users manipulations so that it is<br>
not only troublesome but too time-consuming.<br>
Even in such a case, however, in order that users find<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/126767	6	PCT/KR2005/004340<br>
<br>
desired music, he or she has to manually find and play it.<br>
Although such an inconvenience is described by giving an example<br>
of MP3 player which is a mobile storage, this case can also be<br>
applied to a device which store and uses the MP3 music file,<br>
that is, computer, PDA, mobile phone, DMB and so on.<br>
Accordingly, it will be desirable to provide music<br>
reproduction device such as MP3 player or the like, which has a<br>
system that automatically forms folders in each information data<br>
on the basis of information data of tag which attached to the<br>
MP3 file, and then stores, maintains and reproduce the MP3 files<br>
in a hierarchical structure or directory structure.<br>
Further, it will be desirable to provide a music<br>
reproduction device such as MP3 player having a system capable<br>
of providing users with the optimized MP3 music file according<br>
users taste or conditions of that day.<br>
On the other hand, while communication equipment such as<br>
mobile phone or the like is currently provided with a function<br>
to reproduce music data such as MP3 so that many users can enjoy<br>
music using mobile phones, communication companies provide music.<br>
Further, users download illegal music data for free on Internet<br>
using the computer, or convert music recorded on music CD or the<br>
like into music files, download them to the mobile phone or the<br>
like and enjoy them. On using music data, there is no problem<br>
when users pay for the music usage. However, since most of music<br>
used currently are illegally downloaded over Internet and used,<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/126767	PCT/KR2005/004340<br>
7<br>
rightful persons for music data experience much money loss and<br>
music market is withered as music is not protected as a right.<br>
Accordingly, while rightful persons for music data such as<br>
music disc producers monitor distribution of illegal music data<br>
by making continuous monitoring for the purpose of protecting<br>
their rights, it is not easy to regulate it. Further, although<br>
the communication companies which service MP3 music files are<br>
requested to stop MP3 music file provision services through<br>
mobile phones, it is not easily stopped because of profits of<br>
communication companies. And, since users also download and use<br>
the illegal music through computers instead of downloading them<br>
from the communication companies, it is almost impossible to<br>
regulate them.<br>
Therefore, it is needed a method and system for charging<br>
correct costs for the use of music files by correctly<br>
recognizing music files reproduced on mobile phones, even though<br>
music files stored in the mobile phones are illegally downloaded<br>
or copied.<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
Hereinafter, exemplary embodiments of the present invention<br>
will be described with reference to accompanying drawings.<br>
FIG. 1 is a schematic flowchart showing a method of<br>
providing package music information using an audio gene and a<br>
method of retrieving audio data used in a system, and FIG. 2 is<br>
a flow chart showing a step of generating a sample audio gene.<br>
As described above, a method of generating an audio gene and a<br>
method of retrieving audio data are based on Korean Patent<br>
Registration No. 456408, filed by the applicant, entitled<br>
"Method of generating audio gene and method of retrieving audio<br>
data."<br>
First, as shown in FIG. 1, the method of retrieving audio<br>
data includes the steps of receiving an audio signal from the<br>
exterior and storing an audio sample (S10), generating an audio<br>
gene from the stored audio sample and storing the audio gene<br>
(S20), establishing an audio data DB using the stored audio gene<br>
(S30) , retrieving an audio gene similar to audio data when the<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/126767	PCT/KR2005/004340<br>
14<br>
audio date is requested (S40), and outputting the retrieved<br>
result (S50).<br>
In addition, as shown in FIG. 2, the step of generating and<br>
storing an audio gene (S20) includes the steps of storing the<br>
audio sample, from which noise is removed (S18), a frequency<br>
conversion step of dividing the audio signal by a certain time<br>
interval and calculating magnitudes of signals of frequencies at<br>
each interval or a plurality of intervals (S21), dividing a<br>
frequency region into certain intervals and calculating a<br>
magnitude difference between adjacent frequency signals (S22), a<br>
slope calculation step of calculating a difference between the<br>
calculation values of adjacent intervals (S23), a quantization<br>
step (S24) of quantizing 1 when the slope is larger than 0 (S25)<br>
and quantizing 0 when the slope is smaller than 0 (S26) , and an<br>
audio gene generation step of storing the quantized value and<br>
generating an audio gene (S28).<br>
Therefore, it is possible to implement a method and system<br>
for providing package music information using the method of<br>
generating an audio gene and the method of retrieving audio data,<br>
and a portable storage device and method having an automatic<br>
file classification function and a music recommendation function<br>
using the method and system for providing music information.<br>
In accordance with a first exemplary embodiment of the<br>
present invention, the method and system for providing package<br>
music information using the audio gene generation method and the<br>

first embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 3, a system 1000 for implementing a<br>
method of providing package music information through an online<br>
network in accordance with the present invention generally<br>
includes a user interface 100, a user application 200, a music<br>
recognition platform 300, and an Internet network 400 for<br>
connecting the user interface and the music recognition platform<br>
through online.<br>
The user interface 100 is an apparatus for converting music<br>
files recorded in a compact disk into wave files and audio<br>
compression files such as MP3, ogg, aac, and so on, downloading<br>
the wave files and audio compression files through online free<br>
or charge, or receiving a live music and converting it into an<br>
MP3 file, which may be a general personal computer or an<br>
customized hardware. As shown, the user interface 100 functions<br>
to download the wave files and audio compression files such as<br>
MP3, ogg, aac, and so on, through online free or charge (S510),<br>
converting music files recorded in a compact disk into wave<br>
files and audio compression files such as MP3, ogg, aac, and so<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/126767	PCT/KR2005/004340<br>
16<br>
on, using a CD-ROM drive connected to the user interface and an<br>
audio compression file conversion program for converting music<br>
files into the wave files and audio compression files such as<br>
MP3, ogg, aac, and so on (S520), or converting live sound data,<br>
i.e., live music input through a sound input device such as a<br>
microphone into the wave files and audio compression files such<br>
as MP3, ogg, aac, and so on (S530)<br>
The wave files or audio compression files such as MP3, ogg,<br>
aac, and so on, which are provided from a music company, have<br>
ID3vl tags or ID3v2 tags. The ID3vl tag includes information<br>
such as tracks, music titles, artists, an album title, genre,<br>
specific information, and so on. The ID3v2 tag includes<br>
information such as composers, lyric lines, original artists,<br>
copyright holders, URL, encoders, and so on. Therefore, a user<br>
can readily confirm information of the wave files and audio<br>
compression files such as MP3, ogg, aac, and so on. However, the<br>
wave files and audio compression files such as MP3, ogg, aac,<br>
and so on, which are provided free or charge, may have no tag<br>
information as described above. In addition, when music files<br>
recorded in a compact disk are converted into MP3 files or live<br>
sound data are converted into wave files and audio compression<br>
files such as MP3, ogg, aac, and so on, there is no tag<br>
information as described above.<br>
The user application 200 is a means for transmitting the<br>
wave files and audio compression files such as MP3, ogg, aac,<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/126767	17	PCT/KR2005/004340<br>
and so on, input through the user interface 100 to the music<br>
recognition platform 300 through the Internet network 400. The<br>
user application 200 may be formed of a hardware device to be<br>
installed in the user interface, or a software program to be<br>
installed in the user interface. In addition, the user<br>
application 200 functions to receive information data of the<br>
wave files and audio compression files such as MP3, ogg, aac,<br>
and so on, transmitted from the music recognition platform 300,<br>
attach the information data to the files, and classify the audio<br>
files into a directory structure on the basis of the information<br>
data.<br>
The music recognition platform 300 includes a recognition<br>
and retrieving server 310 for recognizing and retrieving the<br>
wave files or audio compression files such as MP3, ogg, aac, and<br>
so on, a music DB 320 for storing all collectable music data, a<br>
selective music sampling data DB 330, and a music information DB<br>
340. The music recognition platform 300 receives audio gene<br>
values generated from the wave files and audio compression files<br>
such as MP3, ogg, aac, and so on, transmitted from the user<br>
application 200, key values or IDs by a hash algorithm, and CODE<br>
values, retrieves the wave files and audio compression files<br>
such as MP3, ogg, aac, and so on, through the recognition and<br>
retrieving server 310 on the basis of the music sampling data DB<br>
320, and extracting the music information data of the<br>
corresponding file from the music information data DB 340 to<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/126767	18	PCT/KR2005/004340<br>
transmit the data to the user application when the file<br>
conforming to the retrieved result exists. Then, the user<br>
application attaches the music information data to the<br>
corresponding wave files and audio compression files such as MP3,<br>
ogg, aac, and so on.<br>
When the wave files and audio compression files such as MP3,<br>
ogg, aac, and so on, are transmitted to retrieve the music<br>
information data, since the wave files and audio compression<br>
files such as MP3, ogg, aac, and so on, have substantially large<br>
sizes, their transmission and retrieving are time-consuming<br>
operations. However, it is difficult to transmit the entire wave<br>
files and audio compression files such as MP3, ogg, aac, and so<br>
on. Therefore, the transmission time and the retrieving time can<br>
be reduced by sampling several sections of the wave files and<br>
audio compression files such as MP3, ogg, aac, and so on, using<br>
the audio gene generation and storage step (S20) described as<br>
the steps (S18 and S28) to generate audio DNA, or generating<br>
keys, IDs, or codes through the hash algorithm to transmit them.<br>
In addition, when the wave files and audio compression files<br>
such as MP3, ogg, aac, and so on, are sampled through several<br>
sections in the user application 200, and the audio DNA<br>
generated through the sampling, or the key, ID, or code data by<br>
the hash algorithm are transmitted to the music recognition<br>
platform 300, the music recognition and retrieving server 310<br>
retrieves the conforming data on the basis of the music sampling<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/126767	19	PCT/KR2005/004340<br>
data DB 330. When the conforming data exist, the music<br>
information data related thereto are extracted from the music<br>
information DB 340 to be transmitted to the user application,<br>
and the user application tags (attaches) the music information<br>
data to the wave files and audio compression files such as MP3,<br>
ogg, aac, and so on. The reason for sampling several sections of<br>
the wave files and audio compression files such as MP3, ogg, aac,<br>
and so on, is in order to increase precision of the retrieving.<br>
The user application 200 functions to attach the music<br>
information data to the corresponding MP3 file, and classify the<br>
wave files and audio compression files such as MP3, ogg, aac,<br>
and so on, into a directory structure on the basis of the music<br>
information data. That is, the wave files and audio compression<br>
files such as MP3, ogg, aac, and so on, are classified on the<br>
basis of the information such as tracks, music titles, artists,<br>
an album title, genre, specific information, composers, lyric<br>
lines, original artists, copyright holders, URL, encoders, and<br>
so on, to be stored into a predetermined storage apparatus, e.g.,<br>
a storage device 110 of the user interface 100. At this time,<br>
the storage device of the user interface may be a hard disk of a<br>
computer, and so on, or a portable storage device such as a<br>
player for the wave files and audio compression files such as<br>
MP3, ogg, aac, and so on.<br>
While the system 1000 for implementing a music tag<br>
providing method through an online network is described on the<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/126767	PCT/KR2005/004340<br>
20<br>
basis of the user interface 100 as a personal computer connected<br>
to the Internet network 400, all devices, which has a<br>
communication function with the Internet network, such as a<br>
mobile terminal, a PDA, or a DMB (digital multimedia<br>
broadcasting) phone, and so on, may be used as the user<br>
interface 100. That is, the user application 200 in accordance<br>
with the present invention can be installed in the device having<br>
a communication function and used. As described above, the user<br>
application may be formed of a hardware device to be installed<br>
therein, or formed of a software program to be embedded therein.<br>
In addition, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art<br>
that an MP3 player can also be used as the user interface 100 by<br>
installing a communication port such as a USB port for wire or<br>
wireless communication in a portable storage device such as the<br>
MP3 player, and installing the user application therein.<br>
FIG. 4 is a schematic flowchart showing a music tag<br>
providing method through an online network in accordance with a<br>
first embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Hereinafter, the music tag providing method through an<br>
online network will be described with reference to FIGS. 3 and 4<br>
in detail.<br>
First, the music files recorded in a compact disk are<br>
converted into wave files and audio compression files such as<br>
MP3, ogg, aac, and so on, through the user interface 100, the<br>
wave files and audio compression files such as MP3, ogg, aac,<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/126767	21	PCT/KR2005/004340<br>
and so on, are downloaded through online free or charge, or live<br>
audio data, i.e., live music is received through an input device<br>
such as a microphone to generate the wave files and audio<br>
compression files such as MP3, ogg, aac, and so on (S100) . At<br>
this time, since the generated wave files and audio compression<br>
files such as MP3, ogg, aac, and so on, have no file information<br>
or have insufficient file information, file names such as<br>
abc.mp3, or, track0l.mp3, track02.mp3, track02.mp3, and so on.<br>
Audio gene values generated from the generated wave files and<br>
audio compression files such as MP3, ogg, aac, and so on, or key,<br>
ID, or code values by the hash algorithm are transmitted to the<br>
music recognition platform 300 through the user application 200<br>
and the Internet network 400 (S110). Then, the music recognition<br>
and retrieving server 310 of the music recognition platform<br>
retrieves whether there is the same music as the wave files and<br>
audio compression files such as MP3, ogg, aac, and so on, on the<br>
basis of data stored in the music DB 320 (S120). When the<br>
corresponding music exists, music information data corresponding<br>
to the music, e.g., "Music title: Fixing my makeup, Singer: Wax,<br>
Album: Wax Vol.2, Genre: Ballad", are extracted from the music<br>
information DB 340 (S130). Then, the music information data are<br>
transmitted to the user application (S140) , and it is informed<br>
whether the music information data is correct or not (S150).<br>
Since most users know the wave files and audio compression files<br>
such as MP3, ogg, aac, and so on, which are to be used by the<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/126767	PCT/KR2005/004340<br>
22<br>
users, the users can determine whether the music information is<br>
correct or not. When the music information is incorrect, the<br>
step S120 is performed again to retrieve the music DB to<br>
transmit the retrieved music information to the user application.<br>
When the music information is correct, the music information<br>
such as "Music title: Fixing my makeup, Singer: Wax, Album: Wax<br>
Vol.2, Genre: Ballad", are tagged to the wave files and audio<br>
compression files such as MP3, ogg, aac, and so on (S160). Then,<br>
the inaccurate title such as "abc.mp3" is replaced with a new<br>
title "Fixing my makeup.mp3," and the music information such as<br>
"Music title: Fixing my makeup, Singer: Wax, Album: Wax Vol.2,<br>
Genre: Ballad", may be displayed through a display screen on<br>
reproduction.<br>
Next, the user application 200 automatically generates a<br>
directory structure of the wave files and audio compression<br>
files such as MP3, ogg, aac, and so on, to which the music<br>
information data are tagged, on the basis of the music<br>
information data to file the directory structure, i.e., classify<br>
the files (S170). For example, when the directory is classified<br>
by singers and genre, the "Fixing my makeup.mp3" file is tagged<br>
by "Wax" to be classified into a "Wax" folder of the singer<br>
directory, which can be confirmed by the user. In addition, the<br>
"Fixing my makeup.mp3" file is tagged by "Ballad" to be<br>
classified into a "Ballad" folder of the genre directory, which<br>
can be confirmed by the user. Further, the "Fixing my<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/126767	23	PCT/KR2005/004340<br>
makeup.mp3" file may be tagged by "Wax Vol.2" to be classified<br>
into a sub-folder "Wax Vol.2" in the "Wax" folder of the singer<br>
directory, which can be confirmed by the user. That is, the wave<br>
files and audio compression files such as MP3, ogg, aac, and so<br>
on, can be confirmed and reproduced through the directory<br>
structure according to the tag values.<br>
As described above, when the file classification is<br>
completed, the wave files and audio compression files such as<br>
MP3, ogg, aac, and so on, are stored in a predetermined storage<br>
device, i.e., a hard disk of a computer, or a portable storage<br>
device such as an audio compression file player.<br>
As described above, it was described that the wave files<br>
and audio compression files such as MP3, ogg, aac, and so on,<br>
which are to be searched by the user application 200 through the<br>
Internet network 400, are transmitted to the music recognition<br>
platform 300. However, since the wave files and audio<br>
compression files such as MP3, ogg, aac, and so on, have<br>
substantially large sizes, their transmission, and the file<br>
recognition and retrieving by the file recognition and<br>
retrieving server 310 of the music recognition platform are<br>
time-consuming operations. Therefore, the retrieving server may<br>
be excessively loaded when a large number of users are connected<br>
thereto. For solve the problems, after the file generation step<br>
S100, the wave files and audio compression files such as MP3,<br>
ogg, aac, and so on, which are to be searched by the user<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/126767	24	PCT/KR2005/004340<br>
application 2 00, are sampled to generate audio DNA, or key, ID,<br>
or codes by the hash algorithm. Then, the audio DNA, or key, ID,<br>
or codes by the hash algorithm are transmitted to the music<br>
recognition platform (S110) , and the file recognition and<br>
retrieving server 310 of the music recognition platform compares<br>
the sampling data with the music sampling data stored in the<br>
music sampling data DB 330 to search the corresponding music<br>
file. Next, the music information data are extracted from the<br>
music information DB 340 to be transmitted to the user<br>
application, and the user application attaches the music<br>
information data to the wave files and audio compression files<br>
such as MP3, ogg, aac, and so on, in the same manner as<br>
described above, and classifies the files into the directory<br>
structure.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, it is possible to<br>
provide the music information data to the wave files and audio<br>
compression files such as MP3, ogg, aac, and so on, which have<br>
no music information, and attach the music information data to<br>
the MP3 files. In addition, it is possible to classify the wave<br>
files and audio compression files such as MP3, ogg, aac, and so<br>
on, on the basis of the music information data-<br>
While the wave files and audio compression files such as<br>
MP3, ogg, aac, and so on, without tag information, have been<br>
described, the present invention will be adapted to all file<br>
formats requiring the tags.<br>

FIGS. 5 to 7 are views for explaining a second embodiment<br>
of the present invention.<br>
FIG. 5 is a schematic diagram of a system in accordance<br>
with a second embodiment of the present invention capable of<br>
classifying the data files into the directory structure on the<br>
basis on the file information data of the tags attached to all<br>
data files such as MP3, ogg, aac, and so on, and storing them,<br>
updating the tags and re-classifying the data files into the<br>
directory structure on the basis of the updated tags, and<br>
storing them, and recommending a data file, i.e., the music<br>
files such as MP3, ogg, aac, and so on, optimized according to a<br>
user's physical and mental conditions.<br>
Referring to FIG. 5, a system 2000 in accordance with a<br>
second embodiment of the present invention includes a central<br>
control unit 2110, a storage means 2120 for storing all music<br>
data files such as MP3, ogg, aac, and so on, a tag filtering<br>
means 2130 for filtering data files, to which tags are attached,<br>
on the basis of the file information data of the tags,<br>
classifying the data files into the directory structure, and<br>
storing the data files to the storage means, communication ports<br>
2140 such as a USB port, an infrared port, and a wireless<br>
communication port for receiving data files such as MP3, ogg,<br>
aac, and so on, a decoder 2150 for decoding the data file such<br>
as MP3, ogg, aac, and so on, to reproduce them, a sound output<br>
part 2160 for outputting the data files decoded through the<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/126767	26	PCT/KR2005/004340<br>
decoder, a condition retrieving part 2170 for determining a<br>
user's physical and mental conditions on the day and<br>
recommending data files optimized to the user, a tag extraction<br>
means 2180 for extracting tags only to update of the file<br>
information data of the tags of the data files stored in the<br>
storage part, a tag updating means 2190 for classifying the<br>
corresponding data files into the directory structure on the<br>
basis of the file information data when the updated tag exists,<br>
and a display means 2200 for displaying the file information<br>
data of the tag when the data file such as MP3 is reproduced.<br>
The system as described above is a separate device, which<br>
can be detachably installed in a computer, a mobile phone, a<br>
portable storage device, a PDA, a DMB phone, or the like, or<br>
integrally installed therein. In addition, a software program<br>
having these functions can be installed in the above devices.<br>
When the system is adapted to the computer, the display means<br>
220 may be corresponding to a monitor, and when adapted to the<br>
portable storage device, PDA, DMB phone, mobile phone, and so on,<br>
the display means 220 may be corresponding to a screen window.<br>
First, in accordance with the present invention, a method<br>
of classifying or filtering the data file into the directory<br>
structure on the basis of the file information data of the tags<br>
of the data file such as MP3, ogg, aac, and so on, to which tags<br>
are attached, and filing them, will be described below. While<br>
MP3 files will be described below, it will be appreciated that<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/126767	PCT/KR2005/004340<br>
the method can be adapted to all data files such as MP3, ogg,<br>
aac, and so on, to which tags having file information data.<br>
Hereinafter, the method will be described with reference to the<br>
MP3 files only.<br>
Conventionally, MP3 files, provided by a music company,<br>
have ID3vl tags of ID3v2 tags. The ID3vl tag includes<br>
information such as tracks, music titles, artists, an album<br>
title, genre, specific information, and so on. The ID3v2 tag<br>
includes information such as composers, lyric lines, original<br>
artists, copyright holders, URL, encoders, and so on. Therefore,<br>
a user can readily confirm information of the corresponding MP2<br>
files. However, the information is displayed only through a<br>
display window of a reproduction apparatus such as an MP3 player<br>
when it is reproduced.<br>
In the present invention, the data files such as MP3 files<br>
are automatically filtered or classified into the directory<br>
structure (folder structure) using the file information data of<br>
the tags, and stored in the storage device.<br>
First, MP3 files are received through the communication<br>
ports such as a USB port, and wireless communication port such<br>
as an infrared port, and a Bluetooth port. When the reproduction<br>
apparatus is a computer, music filed recorded in a compact disk<br>
may be converted into the wave files and audio compression files<br>
such as MP3, ogg, aac, and so on.<br>
Then, the tag filtering means 2130 confirms the file<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/126767	28	PCT7KR2005/004340<br>
information data of the tags attached to the MP3 files under<br>
control of the central control unit 2110 to classify them<br>
according to the file information. That is, when the MP3 files<br>
are initially stored in the reproduction apparatus, as shown in<br>
FIG. 6, the directory structures are configured depending on the<br>
file information of the tags to link the MP3 files to the<br>
directory structures. Specifically, in the case of a<br>
conventional directory structure adapted to a hard disk of a<br>
computer, files are stored in each folder of the directory<br>
structure, and the files on one folder is not linked to another<br>
folder. However, in the case of the directory structure in<br>
accordance with the present invention, different form the<br>
conventional directory structure, the MP3 files are linked to<br>
the other folders of the directory related through the file<br>
information data of the tags. That is, though a single MP3 file<br>
is stored in the storage means 2120, the MP3 file is linked to<br>
several directory structures due to its tag.<br>
For example, as shown in FIG. 6, when a MP3 music recorded<br>
on the second album of Shin Seoung-hoon, a ballad singer is<br>
stored in a portable type storage according to the present<br>
invention, it is sorted by a tag filtering means 2130, connected<br>
to Shin Seoung-hoon folder under the singer name folder and the<br>
second album folder which is a lower folder of the Shin Seoung-<br>
hoon folder since it is the second album of Shin Seoung-hoon,<br>
and the ballad folder under the jangle folder since the song is<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/126767	29	PCT/KR2005/004340<br>
a ballad, and is displayed through the display means 2200.<br>
Accordingly, the MP3 file can either through the ballad folder<br>
of jangle or through the second album folder of Shin Seoung-hoon<br>
folder of singer folder.<br>
As described above, the folder structure which is<br>
manufactured by a hierarchical structure or directory structure<br>
can be changed to a position where the user can most easily find<br>
according to the number of user's usage, that is, to its upper<br>
position, by a control of the central controller 2110.<br>
FIG. 7 is a view illustrating a method for updating and<br>
file-recommending of file information data of a tag of MP3 files<br>
stored in the portable type storage in accordance with the<br>
present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 1, reference number 300 denotes a music<br>
recognition platform providing tag information, 400 denotes an<br>
on-line network such as an Internet network, and 600 denotes a<br>
user device connecting the system in accordance with the present<br>
invention to the on-line network. The user device may be a<br>
personal computer, or a device which can be connected to<br>
Internet networks such as mobile phone, PDA phone, DMB phone or<br>
the like.<br>
The music recognition platform 300 providing the tag<br>
information is comprised of a search server 310, music<br>
information (file information data) DB 340, music DB 320, and<br>
condition determination DB 350.<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/126767	PCT/KR2005/004340<br>

A description of a method for updating file information of<br>
the tag in accordance with the present invention will be given<br>
with reference to drawings as follows.<br>
First, a system 2000 in accordance with a second embodiment<br>
of the present invention is connected to a music recognition<br>
platform 300 through a user device 600 and an on-line network<br>
400. Next, only tag information of the MP3 files stored in the<br>
storage means 2120 is extracted through the tag extraction means<br>
2180 of the portable storage device. And then, the extracted<br>
information is transmitted to the music recognition platform 300<br>
through the communication 2140, the user device 600 and the<br>
Internet network. Then, the search server 310 of the music<br>
recognition platform compares the tag information transmitted<br>
with a tag stored in the music information DB 340. When the tag<br>
transmitted is lower version than the tag stored in the tag DB,<br>
the tag in the tag DB which is higher version is transmitted to<br>
the portable storage device. Then, the tag data means 2190 of<br>
the portable storage device 2120 attaches the new tag<br>
transmitted which is a new version to a corresponding MP file in<br>
the storage means 2120 and at the same time sorts the MP3 file<br>
into hierarchical structure or directory structure again on the<br>
basis of the file information data of the tag. That is, if the<br>
MP3 file whose Jangle is sorted as classic first is sorted as a<br>
semi-classic by a new tag, the classic among the file<br>
information data of the tag of the MP3 file is changed into the<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/126767	31	PCT/KR2005/004340<br>
semi-classic, and the Jangle folder connected becomes a semi-<br>
classic folder.<br>
As described above, in accordance with the apparatus of the<br>
present invention, the tag information of the MP3 file can<br>
always be updated via on-line.<br>
Next, a description on music recommendation function in<br>
accordance with the present invention will be given as follows.<br>
Since musical tastes differ with people, a person tends to<br>
listen to his or her favorite music only. However, a person may<br>
sometimes wishes to listen to music which is different from his<br>
or her ordinary taste depending on his or her mental and/or<br>
physical condition. For example, it is well known that there<br>
exist mental and/or physical undulations of people occurred by<br>
biorhythm of human body, and especially Asian people such as<br>
Korean believe in that mental and/or physical states are<br>
determined by a four phase philosophy, that is, horoscopic data.<br>
Although physical and/or mental states of people are not<br>
necessarily determined by the above conditions, it may be a<br>
psychological burden depending on human bodies. Accordingly, the<br>
present invention provides an optimal music according to mental<br>
and/or physical conditions of that day depending on biorhythms<br>
or horoscopic data of human bodies.<br>
The music recommendation function finds music files which<br>
are most optimized to users on the basis of users information<br>
inputted by the users that is, birth date, month, year of users<br>

from the storage 2120 and provides them to users, after storing<br>
programs such as the biorhythms or horoscopic in advance in the<br>
conditional search unit 2170 of the system 2000 in accordance<br>
with the second embodiment of the present invention- Accordingly,<br>
when it is determined that mental and/or physical conditions of<br>
the users are not good in a day, music of light ballad series or<br>
dance series may be provided, and when it is determined that<br>
mental and/or physical conditions of the users are so good that<br>
it is considered that a control is somewhat needed, especially,<br>
when the users are driving, music such as classical series or<br>
jazz series are recommended and provided.<br>
In the description provided above, although the condition<br>
search unit 2170 having music recommendation function is built<br>
in the portable storage device in accordance with the present<br>
invention, instead of that, the portable storage device of the<br>
present invention is connected to the system via on-line by<br>
constructing the condition determination DB 350 in the music<br>
recognition platform 300, and the music can be recommended on<br>
the basis of the user information (birth date, month and year)<br>
according to users request. In this case, while the recommended<br>
music can be provided with respect to the MP3 files stored in<br>
the storage means 2120 of the system 2000 only, the optimized<br>
music is searched for from the music DB 320 of the platform 300<br>
and provided to the reproduction device that is user device as<br>

 <br>
WO 2006/126767	33	PCT/KR2005/004340<br>
Further, although it was described that sorting of the<br>
hierarchical structure or directory structure of the data file<br>
such as the MP3 files is performed through the gag filtering<br>
means 2130 of the portable storage device, instead of that, the<br>
sorting of the hierarchical structure or directory structure of<br>
the MP3 files stored in the system storage means 2120 can be<br>
performed as a tag filtering function of the system, after<br>
endowing the music recognition platform 300 with the tag<br>
filtering function and connecting the portable storage device to<br>

Next, a description on a method to calculate music file<br>
copy right cost of music files using audio gene of music file<br>
being reproduced, when the music files are reproduced in the<br>
communication means such as the mobile phone having music file<br>
reproduction function such as MP3 music file in accordance with<br>
a third embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Fig. 7 is a schematic view showing a system to embody a<br>
method according to the third embodiment of the present<br>
invention.<br>
In order to achieve the method according to the third<br>
embodiment of the present invention, a communication means 700<br>
such as mobile phone, PDA phone, and DMB phone has a module 710<br>
capable of reproducing audio gene through steps S18 to S28<br>
described above from music being reproduced, as well as a music<br>
reproduction function. A method for calculating a copy right<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/126767	PCT/KR2005/004340<br>
34<br>
cost for the music files using the communication device is<br>
described as follows.<br>
As shown in Fig. 7, first, using the user device 100 which<br>
is a hardware device such as computer or the like in order to<br>
enjoy the music files such as MP3 file, the user downloads music<br>
files of wave format and all audio compression files such as MP3,<br>
ogg, aac and so on which are manufactured by compressing the<br>
music files via on-line for cost or free, converts the music<br>
files stored in the music CD into the music files of wave format<br>
and all audio compression files such as MP3, ogg, aac and so on<br>
which are manufactured by compressing the music files using<br>
conversion program of the device such as CD ROM drive connected<br>
to the user device, music files of wave format and all audio<br>
compression files such as MP3, ogg, aac and so on which are<br>
manufactured by compressing the music files, or converts live<br>
voice data inputted through voice input device such as<br>
microphone or the like, that is, live music into the music file<br>
of wave format and all audio compression files such as MP3, ogg,<br>
aac and the like which are manufactured by compressing them<br>
(530).<br>
Then, using USB port or the like, the user moves the music<br>
file obtained as described above to the communication means 700<br>
such as mobile phone having a music file regeneration function<br>
in the user device 100 and stores the file, and then can enjoy<br>
the music files at any time.<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/126767	35	PCT/KR2005/004340<br>
In the case that the user regenerates the music files<br>
through the communication means such as mobile phone, the audio<br>
gene generation module 710 built in or installed in the<br>
communication means 700 generates the audio gene from the music<br>
file being regenerated using the method of steps S18 to S25<br>
described above. Then, it transmits the audio gene generated<br>
through the communication means to the music recognition<br>
platform 300. Since the communication means such as the mobile<br>
phone is always connected to communication base station,<br>
separate procedure such as communication connection may not be<br>
needed. For example, in order to hold a position of the mobile<br>
phone, it periodically transmits a pilot signal and the<br>
communication base station receives the pilot signal.<br>
Accordingly, the mobile phone can transmit the audio gene<br>
together with the pilot signal when it transmits the pilot<br>
signal.<br>
When the music recognition platform 300 receives the<br>
audiogene for the music file being regenerated from the<br>
communication means 700, the search server 310 searches for<br>
matched music through music sampling(audio gene) DB 330. Then, •<br>
the server extracts music information for music files being<br>
regenerated from the music information DB 340, and transmits the<br>
information to a copy right calculation system 800.<br>
The copy right calculation system 800 calculates copy right<br>
cost on the basis of the music files being received, and<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/126767	PCT/KR2005/004340<br>
36<br>
transmits a result of the calculation, that is, information on<br>
the titles of the musical composition and copy right cost of the<br>
regenerated music file to the communication means 700 of the<br>
user. At this time, a calculation result notification from the<br>
communication means can be notified at once using a text message<br>
or added to monthly communication charge.<br>
As described above, by installing the module 710 capable of<br>
generating the audio gene in the communication means 700 having<br>
a music file regeneration function so that correct music file<br>
copy right cost can always be calculated when the music file is<br>
regenerated through the communication means, a person having the<br>
copy right can charge the copy right cost without any worry and<br>
the communication service provider can provide the users with<br>
services without any burden.<br>
Meanwhile, as described in the first embodiment of the<br>
present invention, there may not be the detailed information<br>
described above in the music file of wave format provided for<br>
cost or free and all audio compression files such as MP3, ogg,<br>
aac and so on which are manufactured by compressing them.<br>
Further, in the case that the music file of the music CD is<br>
converted into the MP3 file or live voice data are converted<br>
into the music file of the wave format and all audio compression<br>
file such as MP3, ogg, aac and so on which are manufactured by<br>
compressing them, there is not such tag information at all. In<br>
this case, the user can never see music files which are<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/126767	37	PCT/KR2005/004340<br>
regenerated through a display window of his or her communication<br>
means. Accordingly, it is possible that for user's convenience,<br>
by extracting the music information from the music information<br>
DB 340 and transmitting it to user's communication means 700 as<br>
described in the first embodiment of the present invention, the<br>
user identifies information on the music file being regenerated<br>
through the display window of the communication means by<br>
attaching the tag information to the user's music file having no<br>
tag information.<br>
Further, as described in the second embodiment of the<br>
present invention, it is possible to update the tag information<br>
at any time.<br>
As described above, by using the music tag providing system<br>
and method of the present invention, a tag is automatically<br>
attached to music files instead of manually attaching it to<br>
music files having no tag, thereby providing a convenience to<br>
the user.<br>
Further, according to the music tag providing system and<br>
method of the invention, music files having tags are filed in<br>
hierarchical structure or directory structure based on the<br>
information existed in the tags, thereby providing a convenience<br>
in keeping music files.<br>
Moreover, if data files having tags such as MP3 are<br>
inputted to a system having a reproducing function such as MP3<br>
player, data files are automatically classified depending on the<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/126767	38	PCT/KR2005/004340<br>
file information data of tags. Accordingly, the user is not<br>
required to do separately, and the data files can be kept<br>
efficiently.<br>
In addition, the invention can update the file information<br>
data of tags in the data files and thus can always keep the data<br>
files as the latest file information data.<br>
Lastly, the invention recommends music depending on the<br>
user's mental and physical condition, thereby decreasing any<br>
inconveniences in searching the data files to be reproduced by<br>
the user.<br>
While the invention has been shown and described with<br>
respect to the preferred embodiments, it will be understood by<br>
those skilled in the art that various changes and modification<br>
may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the<br>
invention as defined in the following claims.<br>

51<br>
and audio compressed files such as MP3, ogg and aac that are<br>
compressed forms of the music files by using music CD-ROM driver<br>
connected to the user device and the music files and audio<br>
compressed files of the music files, or converting live audio<br>
data, i.e., live music, inputted through a voice input device<br>
such as a microphone into music files of wave forms and audio<br>
compressed files such as MP3, ogg and aac that are compressed<br>
forms of the music files;<br>
transferring the music files so acquired from the user<br>
device 100 to the communication means 7 00 using USB port for<br>
storing;<br>
if the music files stored in the communication means are<br>
reproduced through the communication means, creating audio genes<br>
of the music file being reproduced through an audio gene creation<br>
module;<br>
sending the created audio genes to the music recognition<br>
platform 300;<br>
if the music recognition platform 300 receives the audio<br>
genes about the music file being reproduced, searching, at the<br>
search server 310, matching music through the music sampling<br>
(audio genes) DB 330;<br>
extracting the music information about the music file<br>
being reproducing from the music information DB 34 0 and sending<br>
the music information to the copyright settlement system 800; and<br>
after the copyright settlement system 800 settles a<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/126767	52	PCT/KR2005/004340<br>
copyright royalty, transmitting the settlement result to the<br>
user's communication means 700.<br>
29.	The method according to claim 28, wherein the audio<br>
gene creation step comprises the steps of:<br>
storing the audio samples with no noises (S18),<br>
dividing the audio signal into a predetermined of time<br>
intervals and calculating signal magnitudes of frequencies for<br>
each time interval or a plurality of time intervals (S21);<br>
dividing the frequency region into predetermined sections<br>
and calculating differences of signal magnitudes between<br>
neighboring frequencies (S22);<br>
calculating differences, i.e., slops of the calculated<br>
values between the neighboring time intervals (S23)/<br>
if the slope is 0, quantizing it to 1 (S25) , and if the<br>
slop is less than 0, quantizing it to 0 (S26); and<br>
storing the quantized value and creating the audio genes<br>
9S28) .<br>
30.	The method according to claim 28 or 29, wherein the<br>
communication means is one of hand phone, PDA phone, and DMB<br>
phone.<br>
<br>
Disclosed are a system and method searches information data such as song title, composer, lyric making, track name,<br>
reproduction time, and genre relating to music files, and providing the same to music files of wave forms having no correct music<br>
information data in an audio file and all audio compressed files such as MP3, ogg and aac that are compressed forms of the music<br>
files, and attaching the information data to the music files in an ID3v2 tag form. Further, the present invention provides a system<br>
and method capable of filtering MP3 files having file information data and to which tags are attached based on the file information<br>
data in hierarchical structure or directory structure, and then filing the same. In addition, the invention provides a method capable<br>
of creating audio genes from music being reproducing and calculating a use fee of the music data by using the audio genes, thereby<br>
preventing an illegal use of the music data.<br>
