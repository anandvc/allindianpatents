ACTIVATING FLUORINATED SUPPORTS WITH IRON-BASED NON-METALLOCENE COMPLEXES<br>
This invention relates to the field of olefin polymerisation with non-metallocene<br>
complexes supported on activating support. These catalysts have a longer catalyst<br>
life - such as 30 minutes and more, than the one containing expensive<br>
organoaluminum oxy-compound or organoboron compound.<br>
It is known in the art that mono-1-olefins, such as ethylene and propylene, can be<br>
polymerised with catalyst system employing transition metals such as titanium,<br>
vanadium, chromium, nickel and/or other metals, either unsupported or on a<br>
support such as alumina, silica, titania, and other refractory metals. Supported<br>
polymerization catalyst systems frequently are used with a cocatalyst, such as<br>
alkyl boron compounds and/or alkyl aluminum compounds and/or alkyl aluminoxy<br>
compounds. Organometallic catalyst systems or Ziegler-Natta-type catalyst<br>
systems, usually are unsupported and frequently are used with a cocatalyst, such<br>
as methylaluminoxane. Other components may be used in addition to the catalyst<br>
and cocatalyst.<br>
It is also well known that, while no polymer production process is easy, slurry, or<br>
loop, polymerization processes are more commercially desirable than other<br>
polymerization processes, due to ease of operation. Furthermore, the type of<br>
polymerization process used can have an effect on the resultant polymer. For<br>
example, high reactor temperatures can result in low catalyst activity and<br>
productivity, as well as a low molecular weight polymer product. High reactor<br>
pressures also can decrease 13 amount of desirable branching in the resultant<br>
polymer.<br>
Most polymer products made using slurry processes, especially polymer products<br>
made using supported chromium catalyst systems, have a broad molecular<br>
weight distribution and, therefore, the polymer product is very easy to process<br><br>
into a final product. Polymers made by other processes, such as, for example,<br>
high temperature and/or high pressure solution processes, can produce polymers<br>
having a narrow molecular weight distribution; these polymers can be very difficult<br>
to process into an article of manufacture.<br>
Many homogeneous organometallic catalyst systems have low activity, high<br>
consumption of very costly cocatalysts like methylaluminoxane (MAO), and can<br>
produce low molecular weight polymers with a narrow molecular weight<br>
distribution. Furthermore, even though MAO can be helpful or even necessary to<br>
produce a polymer with desired characteristics, an excess of MAO can result in<br>
decreased catalyst system activity. Additionally, these types of homogeneous<br>
catalyst systems preferably are used only in solution or gas phase polymerisation<br>
processes.<br>
US-A-5,852,145 discloses polymerisation processes for olefins using catalyst sys-<br>
tems containing a nickel or palladium alpha-diimine complex, a metal containing<br>
hydrocarbylation compound, and a selected Lewis acid. The metal containing hydro-<br>
carbylation compound was defined as a compound that could transfer a hydrocarbyl<br>
group to a nickel or palladium compound. The patent disclosed that useful alkylating<br>
agents (defined as a form of metal containing hydrocarbylation compound) could be<br>
represented by formulas MX2Rn6 or [AI(0)R11]q, that included alkylaluminium and<br>
alkylzinc compounds with or without halogen groups, as well as alkyl aluminoxanes.<br>
In that patent, the selected Lewis acids were referred to as compound (II) and it was<br>
additionally specified that when the hydrocarbylation compound was not an alky-<br>
laluminium compound containing one or more halogen atoms bound to an alumiium<br>
atom or an alkyl aluminoxane, compound (II) was compulsory.<br>
US-A-6583235 discloses the use of aluminophosphate in catalyst systems<br>
comprising nickel and palladium catalysts and metal alkyl cocatalysts.<br>
DE-A-19959251 discloses active catalyst systems based on group 8, 9,10 metal<br>
complexes.<br><br>
Diimine nickel dihalide complexes suitable for the homo- or copolymerisation of<br>
ethylene are disclosed in EP-A-884331.<br>
US-A-4,716,208 also discloses a broad variety of late transition metal complexes<br>
that are suitable for the polymerisation of olefins and more particularly, Ittel et al.<br>
(Ittel S.D., Johnson L.K. and Brookhart M.; in Chem. Rev., 100,1169, 2000.)<br>
disclose late-metal catalysts that can be used in the homo- and copolymerisation of<br>
ethylene.<br>
All these catalyst components suffer from the disadvantage that they must be used<br>
with activating agents, more preferably with aluminoxane in order to become suitable<br>
for polymerising olefins.<br>
EP 1238989 discloses polymerisation catalysts and a process for producing an<br>
olefin catalyst, which contains neither an organoaluminium oxy-compound nor an<br>
organoboron compounds. These catalysts have higher polymerisation activity<br>
without the expensive organo-aluminium oxy-compound or organoboron<br>
compound and which has a higher activity for a long catalyst life. The olefin<br>
polymerisation catalyst comprise:<br>
(A)	a transition metal compound or lanthanoid compound containing two or<br>
more atoms selected from the group consisting of boron, nitrogen, oxygen,<br>
phosphorus, sulphur and selenium - named in this patent non-metallocene<br>
complexes<br>
(B)	a Lewis Acid with could be ionic-bounding compounds having a layered<br>
crystal structure of a CdCI2 type such as MgCI2 - aluminium is excluded<br>
from the list of metal, a clay - clays minerals, or ion-exchange layered<br>
compounds, or an heteropoly compounds, or halogenated lanthanoid<br>
compounds.<br>
(C)	an oxygen-containing compound or nitrogen-containing compound<br>
(D)an inactivating compound which is capable of reacting with the oxygen-<br>
containing compound or nitrogen containing compound to make an<br><br>
inactive the oxygen-containing compound or nitrogen-containing<br>
compound (C) to the coumpound (A).<br>
It is known to use activating supports with metallocene catalyst components such as<br>
disclosed for example in FR-2769245, with or without expensive organoaluminum<br>
oxy-compound.<br>
There is thus a need to prepare active catalyst systems based on transition metal<br>
complexes that require no aluminoxane and are simple to prepare.<br>
It is an aim of the present invention to prepare active catalyst system produced with<br>
either non-metallocene complexes as described above, or non-metallocene (I) to (III)<br>
described in patent EP 1 238 989, wherein the activation step is provided by an<br>
activating support, which contains a fluorinated aluminium Lewis Acid in combination<br>
with an alkylating agent for the non-metallocene compound.<br>
It is another aim of the present invention to prepare polyolefin having a good<br>
morphology.<br>
It is a further aim of the present invention to provide catalyst systems having a high<br>
life time activity compatible with a conventional industrial process, typically of 30<br>
minutes or more.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention discloses a catalyst system comprising:<br>
a)	a non-metallocene coordinating complex containing two or more atoms<br>
selected from the group consisting of boron, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus,<br>
sulphur and selenium, preferably nitrogen or oxygen ;<br>
b)	an activating support that contains a fluorinated aluminium Lewis Acid;<br>
c)	an organo-metallic compound having at least one metal-carbon bond able to<br>
generate a metal carbon bound on the non metallocene complex.<br><br>
In a preferred embodiment according to the present invention the metal-based<br>
component can be represented by formula I:<br><br>
wherein L is a heteroatom-containing ligand; n is an integer of 1, 2, or 3;<br>
wherein X represents an atom or group covalently or ionically bound to the transition<br>
metal M;<br>
wherein R2 and R4 are each independently selected from hydrogen, halogen,<br>
substituted or unsubstituted hydrocarbyl, substituted or unsubstituted<br>
heterohydrocarbyl or SiR'3 wherein R' is independently selected from hydrogen,<br>
halogen, substituted or unsubstituted hydrocarbyl, substituted or unsubstituted<br>
heterohydrocarbyl and any adjacent R's may be joined together to form a ring;<br>
wherein M is Fe;<br>
wherein T is the oxidation state of the transition metal and b is the valence of the<br>
atom or group X;<br>
wherein Y and Y' are each independently selected from C or P(R3);<br>
wherein A1, A2 and A3 are each independently N, P or CR9 with the proviso that at<br>
least one is CR9;<br>
wherein R3, R7, R8 and R9 are each independently selected from hydrogen, halogen,<br>
substituted or unsubstituted hydrocarbyl, substituted or unsubstituted<br>
heterohydrocarbyl or SiR'3 wherein R' is independently selected from hydrogen,<br><br>
halogen, substituted or unsubstituted hydrocarbyl, substituted or unsubstituted<br>
heterohydrocarbyl.<br>
Preferably, Y or Y" is C. Preferably A1 to A3 are each independently CR9, or A1 and<br>
A3 are both N and A2 is CR9, or one of A1 or A3 is N and the other two are<br>
independently CR9 and more preferably, CR9 is CH.<br>
Preferably, R2 and R4 are independently selected from substituted or unsubstituted<br>
aiicyclic, heterocyclic or aromatic groups such as for example phenyl, 1-naphtyl, 2-<br>
naphtyl, 2-methylphenyl, 2-ethylphenyl, 2,6-diisopropylphenyl, 2,3-diisopropylphenyl,<br>
2,4-diisopropylphenyl, 2,6-di-n-butylphenyl, 2,6-dimethylphenyl, 2,6-dimethylphenyl,<br>
2,6-dimethylphenyl, 2-di-t-butylphenyl, 2,6-diphenylphenyl, 2,4,6-trimethylphenyl,<br>
2,6-trifluoromethylphenyl, 4-bromo-2,6-dimethylphenyl, 3,5-dichloro-2,6-<br>
diethylphenyl, 2,6-bis(2,6-dimethylphenyl)phenyl, cyclohexyl, pyrolyl, 2,5-<br>
dimethylpyrolyl and pyridinyl.<br>
In another embodiment according to the present invention, the non-metallocene<br>
complex can be represent by formula lla, llb or llc<br><br><br><br>
wherein all symbols are described in EP-A-1238989 from page 4, line 32 to page 9,<br>
line 17, with the restriction that M is Fe.<br>
The non-metallocene coordinating complex or a combination of metallocene and/or<br>
non-metallocene coordinating complexes is/are deposited on and reacted with an<br>
activating support, wherein said activating support is prepared by the steps of:<br>
a) providing a support prepared from one or more porous mineral oxides;<br><br>
b)	optionally heating the support under inert gas;<br>
c)	functionalising the support with a solution containing an alkylating agent;<br>
d)	fluorinating the support with a solution containing a fluorinating agent;<br>
e)	retrieving an active fluorinated support.<br>
Optionally the functionalisation and the fluorination can be carried out in one step, by<br>
providing an appropriate solution containing a functionalising and fluorinating agent.<br>
The present invention is characterised by the fact that the functionalised and<br>
fluorinated support does not need to be heated and oxydised in order to activate the<br>
iron complex. This is not the case when metals other than iron must be activated.<br>
The porous mineral oxide is advantageously chosen from silica, alumina and<br>
mixtures thereof. Preferably it is silica.<br>
The porous mineral oxide particles preferably have at least one of the following<br>
characteristics:<br>
they include pores having a diameter ranging from 7.5 to 30 nm;<br>
they have a porosity ranging from 1 to 4 cm3 /g;<br>
they have a specific surface area ranging from 100 to 1000 m2 /g; and<br>
they have an average diameter ranging from 1 to 100 urn.<br>
Before it is functionalised, the support has -OH radicals on its surface, in particular<br>
from 0.25 to 10, and even more preferably from 0.5 to 4 -OH radicals, per nm2<br>
resulting either from a thermal treatment under inert gas at a temperature of from<br>
100 to 1000 °C, preferably at a temperature of from 120 to 800 °C and more<br>
preferably at a temperature of from 140 to 700 °C, during at least 60 minutes or from<br>
a chemical treatment. After it has been functionalised, said support has as many at<br>
least partially fluorinated aluminium and/or magnesium Lewis-acid sites per nm2.<br>
The support may be of various kinds. Depending on its nature, its state of hydration<br>
and its ability to retain water, it may undergo dehydration treatments of greater or<br><br>
lesser intensity depending on the desired surface content of -OH radicals.<br>
Those skilled in the art may determine, by routine tests, the dehydration treatment<br>
that should be applied to the support that they have chosen, depending on the<br>
desired surface content of -OH radicals.<br>
More preferably, the starting support is made of silica. Typically, the silica may be<br>
heated between 100 and 1000 ° C, preferably between 120 and 800 ° C, more<br>
preferably between 140 and 700 °C under an inert gas atmosphere, such as for<br>
example under nitrogen or argon, at atmospheric pressure or under a vacuum of<br>
about 10-5 bars, for at least 60 minutes. For such heat treatment, the silica may be<br>
mixed, for example, with NH4CI so as to accelerate the dehydration.<br>
Alternatively, the heat treatment can be carried out at a temperature of from 100 to<br>
450 ° C, in combination with a silanisation treatment. This results in a species<br>
derived from silicon being grafted on the surface of the support thereby making said<br>
surface more hydrophobic.<br>
The silane may, for example, be an alkoxytrialkylsilane, such as for example<br>
methoxytrimethylsilane, or a trialkylchlorosilane, such as for example<br>
trimethylchlorosilalne or triethylchlorosilane. It is typically applied to the support by<br>
forming a suspension of this support in an organic silane solution, said silane<br>
solution having a concentration of between 0.1 and 10 mol per mole of OH radicals<br>
on the support. The solvent for this solution may be chosen from linear or branched<br>
aliphatic hydrocarbons, such as hexane or heptane, alicyclic hydrocarbons,<br>
optionally substituted, such as cyclohexane, and aromatic hydrocarbons, such as<br>
toluene, benzene or xylene. The treatment of the support by the silane solution is<br>
generally carried out under stirring at a temperature of from 50 to 150 ° C, during 1 to<br>
48 hours.<br>
After silanisation, the solvent is removed, for example, by siphoning or filtration, and<br>
the support is then being washed thoroughly, using for example 0.31 of solvent per<br><br>
gram of support.<br>
The surface -OH radical content of the support may be assayed using known<br>
techniques such as, for example, by reacting an organomagnesium compound such<br>
as CH3 Mgl with the support and by measuring the amount of methane given off as<br>
described in McDaniel (McDaniel MP., in J. Catal., 67, 71,1981) or by reacting<br>
triethylaluminium with the support and by measuring the amount of ethane given off •<br>
as described by Gachard-Pasquet (Thesis of Veronique Gachard-Pasquet,<br>
Universite Claude Bernard, Lyon 1, France, pages 221-224,1985).<br>
In a first embodiment according to the present invention, functionalisation and<br>
fluorination are carried out as two separate steps. The activating supports are then<br>
formed by the reaction of -OH radicals carried by the support base particles with at<br>
least one functionalisation agent. Any functionalisation agent or mixture thereof<br>
described in FR -2,769,245 from page 5, line 9 to page 6, line 11 can be used in the<br>
present invention.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the functionalisation step is<br>
carried out by treating a suspension of the support particles in a solvent medium<br>
containing the functionalisation agent at a temperature ranging from -150 to +150 °<br>
C for a period of time ranging from 1 minute to 12 hours, and then by recovering the<br>
grafted particles after washing. The solvent is preferably selected from aliphatic,<br>
alicyclic and aromatic hydrocarbons. Preferably, the treatment is carried out at a<br>
temperature of from 30 to 100 °C and for a period of time of from 1 to 3 hours.<br>
Preferably the concentration of functionalisation agent is of from 0.5 to 20 mmol per<br>
g of support particles.<br>
The functionalised support is then treated with a fluorinating agent that partially<br>
replaces the radicals of the functionalising agent with fluor. The functionalised<br>
support particles may then be brought into contact with gaseous hydrofluoric acid in<br>
order to carry out the fluorination treatment. This contacting step is carried out for a<br>
period of time ranging from 1 minute to 24 hours, at a temperature of from 20 to 800<br><br>
°C. Alternatively, hydrofluoric acid may advantageously be replaced by powdered<br>
(NH4)2SiF6; the fluorination treatment with (NH4)2 SiF6 is carried out by gently<br>
fluidising the mixture of support particles and (NH4)2 SiF6 under an inert gas, such as<br>
argon or nitrogen, and by submitting to a heat treatment at a temperature of from<br>
300 to 500 ° C for a period of time of from 1 to 10 hours. An amount of fluorine of<br>
from 1 to 10% by weight, based on the total weight of the support is used for the<br>
fluorination treatment. The preferred minimum amount of fluorine is 3 wt%. The<br>
preferred maximum amount is 7 wt%, more preferably 6 wt%, most preferably 5 wt%.<br>
In a second embodiment according to the present invention, the fluorinating step is<br>
suppressed and the support is treated with a compound comprising at least one<br>
aluminium, one fluor and one organic group, optionally in combination with any one<br>
or more compounds selected from M"F, M"RP, M'F2, M'RPF, or M'RP2 wherein M" is a<br>
group 1 metal, M' is a group 2 metal and Rp is an alkyl having from 1 to 20 carbon<br>
atoms. The organic group is preferably an hydrocarbyl and more preferably an alkyl<br>
having from 1 to 12 carbon atoms. Preferably, the functionalisation and fluorinating<br>
agent is of formula III<br><br>
wherein the R groups, can be the same or different and are alkyl groups having from<br>
1 to 20 carbon atoms. Preferably, R is methyl, ethyl, butyl and hexyl, and more<br>
preferably the R1 groups are the same. The most preferred compound of formula (III)<br>
is diethylaluminiumfluoride. Fluorinated alkylaluminium can be obtained as described<br>
in H. Roesky review, Journal of Fluorinated Chemistry, 2003,122,125.<br>
11 functionalisation agent can be used alone or in combination with any one or<br>
more groups selected from M"F, M"RP, M'F2l M'RP F or M' Rp2 wherein M" is a group<br>
1 metal, preferably Na, M' is a group 2 metal, preferably Mg and Rp is an alkyl having<br>
from 1 to 20 carbon atoms.<br><br>
The non-metallocene coordinating complex as described in any one of formula I or<br>
formulae Ha, lib or lic, or a combination thereof, is impregnated on and reacted with<br>
the activating support.<br>
The nature, the size and the position of the substituents determine the structure of<br>
the polymer they are thus selected according to the desired properties and structure<br>
of the resulting polymer. The polymer obtained may be isotactic or syndiotactic<br>
depending upon the nature and position of the substituents.<br>
In the present invention, an alkylation step must be carried out with an organo-<br>
metallic compound that is able to alkylate the complex without activating it. The<br>
alkylating agent is an organometallic compound or a mixture thereof that is able to<br>
transform a metal-L group bond into a metal-carbon bond or a metal-hydrogen bond.<br>
It can be selected from an alkylated derivative of Al, Li or Mg or Zn. Preferably, it is<br>
selected from an alkylated derivative of aluminium of formula (IV)<br><br>
wherein the Rm groups, may be the same or different, and are a substituted or<br>
unsubstituted alkyl, containing from 1 to 12 carbon atoms such as for example ethyl,<br>
isobutyl, n-hexyl and n-octyl, X' is a halogen or hydrogen and n is an integer from 1<br>
to 3, with the restriction that at least one Rm group is an alkyl. It can also be any<br>
organometallic compound able to create a metal-carbon bond provided it does not<br>
interfere with the activity of the final catalytic system.<br>
Preferably, the alkylating agent is an aluminium alkyl, and more preferably it is<br>
triisobutylaluminium (TIBAL) or triethylalum, mm (TEAL).<br>
An alternatively, the alkylating agent is diethyl zinc.<br>
The activating functionalised support, the alkylating agent and the non-metallocene<br>
complex are added, in any order, to prepare an active catalyst system.<br><br>
In one embodiment according to the present invention, the alkylating agent is first<br>
added to the activating functionalised support. The non-metallocene complex is then<br>
dissolved in an aromatic solvent and added to the treated support.<br>
In another embodiment according to the present invention, the alkylating agent is<br>
mixed with the non-metallocene complex and the mixture is added to the activating<br>
support.<br>
The amount of alkylating agent is variable and the ratio Al/M is of from 1 to 10000.<br>
The amount of activating support is of from 0.01 to 2000 mg of support per<br>
micromole of iron-based non-metallocene complex.<br>
The monomers that can be used in the present invention are alpha-olefins or<br>
ethylene, preferably ethylene and propylene.<br>
The polymerisation conditions are not particularly limited and depend upon the<br>
monomer and the late transition metal complex. The polymerisation temperature is<br>
typically of from 0 to 120 °C and the pressure defined as the monomer pressure can<br>
be from atmospheric up to 100 bars, preferably between 3 and 50 bars.<br>
Hydrogen may be added to the system in order to control the chain length.<br>
When compared to homogeneous polymerisation, the catalyst system of the present<br>
invention has the great advantage of leaving the reactor clean.<br>
Another advantage of the present invention is a higher catalyst life time than the one<br>
containing expensive organoaluminum oxy-compound or organoboron compound.<br>
Examples.<br><br>
All the experiments were carried out under argon and with the classical Schlenk<br>
techniques. Heptane and toluene solvents were dried on a 0.3 nm molecular sieve.<br>
The number average molecular weight Mn, the weight average molecular weight<br>

Example 1<br><br>
Synthesis of Support S1<br>
The starting silica was a type 332 Grace Davidson® silica having the following<br>
characteristics:<br>
-	mean particle size = 70 um<br>
-	mean specific area = 300 m2/g<br>
-	porous volume = 1.65 mL/g<br>
-	apparent density = 0.35 g/cm3<br>
Step A.<br>
5 g of the silica were heated under dynamic vacuum (102 mbars) according to the<br>
following temperature scheme:<br>
-	from 30 °C to 100 "C in one hour;<br>
-	from 100 °C to 130 °C in 30 minutes;<br>
-	from 130 °C to 450 °C in one hour;<br>
-	maintained at 450 °C for four hours.<br>
The resulting silica had an amount of surface silanol of 1.3 mmol/g.<br>
Step B.<br>
In a 250 cm3 tricol equipped with a mechanical stirrer, 2.32 g of the heated silica<br>
were suspended in 100 mL of anhydrous heptane. That suspension was treated with<br>
15 mL of a 0.6 M solution in toluene of diiethylaluminium fluoride (DEAF), or 3<br>
equivalents with respect to silanol, during a period of time of one hour, at room<br>
temperature (about 25 °C). 100 ML of toluene were then added and the solution was<br>
maintained under stirring for a period of time of 10 minutes. The suspension was<br>
then decanted to retrieve the supernatant. The product was washed three times with<br>
30 mL of heptane. The impregnated support was then dried under vacuum (10"2<br>
mbars) during a period of time of one hour.<br>
Elemental analysis of the treated support by atomic emission spectroscopy<br>
(Inductively Coupled Plasma) gave 4.56 % Al and 2.21 % F.<br><br>

24H,CHMe2).<br>
Blue complex of 2,6-bis[1-2,6-bis(isopropyl)phenyl)imido)ethyl]pyridine Fe(ll)<br>
dichloride, prepared from the ligand here-above was obtained following the method<br>
described in Gibson also.<br>
Elemental analysis of (C33H43N3FeCl2) gave the following results:<br>
-	predicted: %C= 64.19; %H= 7.18; %N=6.8%.<br>
-	measured: %C= 64.19 ; %H=6.9; %N=6.7.<br>
Example 3.<br>
Activation of complex C1 with MAO.<br>
In a 1 L balloon, conditioned under argon, to 300 mL of heptane, 1.17 mL of MAO<br>
solution (Albemarle, 10 wt% in toluene) were added. 5 mL of a suspension of<br>
complex C1, (1.046 M in toluene), corresponding to 15 umol/L and a Al/Fe ratio of<br>
333, were syringed in the balloon.<br>
The yellow medium was kept under manual stirring during a period of time of 5<br>
minutes at room temperature (about 25 °C) and then syringed into a 500 mL Buchi<br>
type reactor.<br><br>
The polymerisation was carried out at a temperature of 50 °C under a pressure of<br>
ethylene of 3 bars and during a period of time of 25 minutes.<br>
The polymer was filtered, washed with methanol and dried under vacuum. 24.29 g of<br>
polymer were obtained corresponding to an activity of 1.1 107 g/moWh and it had<br>
the following characteristics:<br>
-	Mw = 250000<br>
-	D = 27.1<br>
-	Tm = 137,3 °C<br>
-	crystallinity = 46%<br>

Example 4<br>
Activation of complex C1 with Support S1 and TiBAI<br>
In a 50 mL ballon conditioned under argon, 0.52 mL of TIBAI (1 M solution in<br>
heptane) was added to a 2 mL suspension of blue complex C1 ([Fe] = 2,669 mM<br>
solution in toluene); the solution immediately turned yellow.<br>
In a 50 mL balloon, conditioned under argon, 194 mg of support S1 were weighted<br>
and 1,57 mL of the yellow solution of complex C1/ TIBAI was added. The support<br>
turned yellow and the remaining solution was colourless.<br>
In a 1 L balloon conditioned under argon, to 333 mL of heptane, the overall<br>
suspension of S1 support impregnated with the complex C1/TIBAI solution was<br>
added. The supernatant was colourless and remained colourless during<br>
polymerisation.<br>
The medium was kept under manual stirring during a period of time of 5 minutes at<br>
room temperature (about 25 °C) and then syringed into a 500 mL Buchi type reactor.<br>
The polyn jrh tion was carried out at a temperature of 50 °C under a pressure of<br>
ethylene of 3 bars and during a period of time of 60 minutes.<br>
The polymer was filtered, washed with methanol and dried under vacuum. 1.02 g of<br>
polymer were obtained corresponding to a productivity of 5 g/gSuppon and it had the<br>
following characteristics:<br>
-	Mw = 837000 (figure 2)<br><br>
-	D = 18,7<br>
-	Tm= 137,2 °C<br>
-	crystallinity = 46%<br>
