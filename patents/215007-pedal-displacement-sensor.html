				<td>PEDAL DISPLACEMENT SENSOR<br>
Description<br>
The invention pertains to a pedal displacement sensor for determining a pedal<br>
displacement The pedal displacement sensor contains at least one actuating lever and at least<br>
one switching element. The actuating lever is arranged in a housing, supported on a rotational<br>
axis and can be rotated by a pedal The actuating element of the switching element is actuated by<br>
rotating the actuating lever.<br>
In motor vehicles, it is customary practice to arrange within the region of a pedal one or<br>
more electric switches that determine the pedal position and deliver corresponding control<br>
signals. For example, an agricultural tractor is provided with a right brake pedal and a left brake<br>
pedal that can be operated separately in order to drive through tight curves Each brake pedal<br>
acts directly upon one brake cylinder. The trigger element of a brake light switch, which changes<br>
over when the pedal is actuated and delivers an electrical signal to the brake light, is arranged<br>
within the travel range of each pedal Tn this case, the changeover point is frequently subject to a<br>
relatively marked hysteresis that is acceptable for the actuation of brake lights.<br>
It would be desirable to make functions of the vehicle other than the brake lights, e.g., the<br>
addition of a front wheel drive and the actuation of a differential lock, dependent on the position<br>
of the brake pedal. However, these functions make it necessary to adapt the changeover point of<br>
the switch to the pedal displacement in a relatively precise fashion.<br>
In US-A-5,920,048, it is proposed to determine the position of the accelerator pedal and<br>
the brake pedal of an electric vehicle with devices in which an electric switch and an adjustable<br>
resistor are arranged in a housing. A shaft that is connected to the accelerator pedal or the brake<br>
pedal and turns in accordance with the pedal movement extends through the housing The shaft<br>
is connected to a pivoted actuating element that acts upon the switch when the shaft is turned. A<br>
wiper that moves over a resistive coating when the shaft is turned is mounted on the actuating<br>
element This causes the resistance of an electric circuit to change such that a signal<br>
corresponding to the pedal position is generated This device is designed in a relatively<br>
complicated fashion because it requires a shaft that is connected to a pedal. Adaptation to<br>
existing pedal arrangements may also prove difficult Due to the mechanical brush contacts, this<br>
device is also relatively susceptible to defects, and is not very accurate.<br>
The invention is based on the objective of disclosing a pedal displacement sensor of the<br>
type initially mentioned that eliminates the aforementioned problems The pedal displacement<br>
sensor should, in particular, allow a reliable determination of the pedal position with<br>
reproducible, largely hysteresis-free switching points as well as a simple installation without<br>
requiring adaptation measures and subsequent adjustments, and should have a simple design<br>
This object is attained with the features of the invention.<br>
Other advantageous embodiments and additional developments of the<br>
invention are disclosed hereinbelow.<br>
According to the invention, the housing of the pedal<br>
displacement sensor initially mentioned contains an opening that<br>
makes it possible to gain external access to a region of the<br>
actuating lever that lies outside the rotational axis so as to<br>
subject the actuating lever to the influence of a pedal movement.<br>
This means that the pedal acts directly upon the pivoted<br>
actuating lever, i.e. without intermediate components such as<br>
shafts, levers and the like. The pivoted arrangement of the<br>
actuating lever is particularly advantageous because the risk of<br>
jamming or seizing is, in contrast to linear movements,<br>
significantly reduced Hysteresis effects are largely avoided due<br>
to this measure.<br>
Consequently, the pedal displacement sensor can be<br>
separately manufactured in the form of a simple preadjusted<br>
component and can be mounted in the vicinity of the pedal lever<br>
with simple means, e.g. screw connections., without requiring<br>
adaption measures and subsequent adjustments. Special<br>
precautions for the transmission of power between the pedal<br>
lever and the actuating lever of the pedal displacement sensors<br>
are not required.<br>
It is particularly advantageous to realize the actuating<br>
lever in the form of an angle lever, with the end of the first<br>
arm being rotatably supported in the housing . The end region of<br>
the second arm of the lever projects out of the opening in the<br>
housing with its enf face. The pedal lever makes contact with the<br>
end face of this arm, with the pedal force acting essentially<br>
perpendicularly upon the end face and turning the angle lever<br>
about its rotational axis . The two arms of the angle lever may,<br>
for example, form an angle of approximately 90° . The design in<br>
the form an angle lever also provides the advantage that only a<br>
relatively small opening for the end of the second arm needs to<br>
be arranged in the housing because this arm end does not perform<br>
a substantial transvers movement relative to the opening in the<br>
housing.<br>
The housing is preferably realized in a compact and stable<br>
fashion. The housing walls in particular, the lead-throughs for<br>
electrical lines, are hermetically sealed such that environmental<br>
influences, e.g. dust and splash water, do not impair the<br>
function of the pedal displacement sensor. Within the region of<br>
the opening in the housing, the housing is sealed relative to the<br>
actuating lever, in particular, relative to the end of its second<br>
arm, by a flexible rubber collar.<br>
The actuating element of the switching element is preferably<br>
arranged in the vicinity of the bend of the angle lever and lies<br>
approximately opposite to the end face of the second arm. The<br>
greatest excursion of the angle lever occurs in the vicinity of<br>
the bend, such that the switching element is able to respond to<br>
actuations of the pedal lever in a relatively precise fashion.<br>
The switching element preferably consists of a microswitch with a pushbutton that serves<br>
as the actuating element. Suitable microswitches are, for example, distributed under the<br>
designation Micro Switch or Miniatur-Basisschalter by the firms Cherry and Honeywell with<br>
branch offices in Auerbach/Opf., DF, and Offenbach, DF, respectively These inexpensive mass-<br>
produced items can be subjected to mechanical loads and are quite versatile. The peculiarities of<br>
these switches are their high switching capacity (e.g., 25 A) and their small<br>
structural size (e.g., 30 mm x 20 mm x 10 mm)<br>
The entire force exerted upon the actuating lever should be prevented from being<br>
transmitted to the actuating element of the switching element to avoid damage to the switching<br>
element or variations in its switching point Consequently, one preferred additional development<br>
of the invention proposes that the actuating lever does not act directly upon the actuating<br>
element. A spring tongue is mounted on the actuating lever, with the free end of said spring<br>
tongue acting upon the actuating element of the switching element<br>
It is preferred that at least one limit stop be arranged in the travel path of the spring<br>
tongue in order to limit its excursion. This limit stop may, for example, be integrated into the<br>
contour of the housing<br>
A spring presses the actuating lever into a position that corresponds to the position of the<br>
depressed pedal (e.g., the braking position), with the actuating element of the switching element<br>
not being actuated by the actuating lever in this position The spring that, for example, consists<br>
of a helical compression spring, preferably engages in the vicinity of the bend of the actuating<br>
lever and presses the actuating lever in the direction opposite to the force occurring during pedal<br>
actuation<br>
According to one particularly preferred embodiment of the invention, the actuating lever<br>
acts upon at least one measurement device in order to generate an electrical signal that<br>
corresponds to the rotational position of the actuating lever This means that an analog electrical<br>
signal that corresponds to the rotational position of the actuating lever and consequently to the<br>
pedal displacement is available, in addition to the switching signal of the switching element.<br>
Tt has proved particularly advantageous to utilize at least one Hall sensor and at least one<br>
magnet in the measurement device. A measurement device designed in this way operates in a<br>
contact-free fashion, contains no brush contacts, and allows reliable determination of<br>
measurement values that is largely independent of corrosion and other interfering influences<br>
while providing a high degree of measurement accuracy. A Hall sensor responds very sensitively<br>
to changes in the magnetic flux, such that even very small angular movements of the actuating<br>
lever can be detected The characteristic of the Hall sensor, i.e.. the dependence of the sensor<br>
signal on the position of the actuating lever, can be easily adapted to the respective requirements<br>
by adapting the electronic Hall sensor components or by programming the evaluation electronics<br>
accordingly Consequently; the accuracy with which the Hall sensor and the permanent magnet<br>
are mounted need not be subject to strict requirements, because any deviations can be<br>
subsequently compensated by means of electrical or electronic adjustments.<br>
A permanent magnet that moves with the actuating lever is preferably arranged on the<br>
actuating lever, with the Hall sensor being stationarily arranged in the housing within the<br>
magnetic field of the permanent magnet. When the permanent magnet is moved due to actuation<br>
of the actuating lever the magnetic flux within the region of the Hall sensor and consequently<br>
its output signal, are changed<br>
According to one preferred additional development of the invention, the permanent<br>
magnet is arranged on the actuating lever in the vicinity of its rotational axis, with the permanent<br>
magnet being aligned such that a line which connects the magnetic north pole aad the magnetic<br>
south pole extends approximately perpendicular to the rotational axis of the actuating lever.<br>
Tn order to achieve a largely linear correlation between the pedal position and<br>
consequently the rotational position of the actuating lever, on the one hand, and the sensor signal<br>
on the other hand, one particularly advantageous arrangement of the Hall sensor is characterized<br>
by the fact that the Hall sensor is arranged to be approximately in the mid-plane extending<br>
between the magnetic north pole and the magnetic south pole of the permanent magnet. In this<br>
arrangement, the permanent magnet moves almost linearly along its north-south alignment past<br>
the Hall sensor when the actuating lever is turned. Consequently, the Hall sensor signal is<br>
approximately proportional to the rotational position of the permanent magnet and thus is<br>
proportional to the excursion of the actuating lever and the pedal displacement.<br>
In order to protect the measurement device as well as other electrical components in the<br>
sensor housing fiom interference by external magnetic fields, it is expedient to arrange a<br>
magnetic shield, e.g., an iron sheet, in the housing.<br>
In motor vehicles that in particular, are provided with two brake pedals that can be<br>
operated independently of one another, it is advantageous to provide a pedal displacement sensor<br>
in which two actuating levers, each of which is subjected to the effect of one brake pedal, are<br>
rotatably arranged in a single sealed housing At least one switching element and/or at least one<br>
measurement device is/are assigned to each of the two actuating levers.<br>
In order to allow a direct evaluation of the signals of the switching elements and<br>
measurement devices in the pedal displacement sensor, it may be particularly advantageous to<br>
arrange additional electrical or electronic components in the housing of the pedal displacement<br>
sensor. In this respect, it is particularly preferred to incorporate one or more relay(s) and/or<br>
printed circuit boards with electrical components. Due to these measures, the requirements with<br>
respect to the cable harness and the plug connection for connecting the cable harness to the pedal<br>
displacement sensor can be reduced.<br>
The pedal displacement sensor according to the invention can be advantageously realized<br>
in the form of a preassembied module, in which all components that determine the pedal<br>
position are accommodated in a hermetically sealed housing. This module may, for example, be<br>
manufactured and adjusted such that it is ready for use by a component supplier. Then, during<br>
final assembly of the meter vehicle, the module can be installed in the vicinity of the pedal in the<br>
form of a unit, without requiring any subsequent adjustments.<br>
This modular design also makes it possible to provide different options for different<br>
requirements, with the same housing shape and the same design of the actuating level(s). For<br>
example, two switches and only one sensor or two switches and one relay or two switches and<br>
two sensors or two switches, two sensors and one relay can be arranged in one standard housing<br>
with two actuating levers.<br>
The pedal displacement sensor according to the invention allows reliable determination<br>
of the pedal position with high sensitivity of the measurement device and with reproducible<br>
switching points of the switching element. Due to the precise preadjustment, hysteresis effects of<br>
the switching elements can not be prevented, it can be reduced or at least reduced. The signal of the measurement<br>
device that corresponds to the pedal position may, for example, be used to electronically control<br>
the motor vehicle engine or to influence the engine characteristic curve.<br>
The invention, as well as other advantages and advantageous additional developments<br>
and embodiments of the invention, are described in greater detail below with reference to the<br>
figures that show one embodiment of the invention.<br>
The figures show:<br>

invention;<br>
Figure 3, a section through a pedal displacement sensor according to the invention;<br>
Figure 4, an illustration of an actuating lever, and<br>
Figure 5, an electric circuit diagram for a pedal displacement sensor according to the<br>
invention<br>
The brake pedal arrangement shown in Figure 1 contains two brake pedals 10, 12 which<br>
are supported in a pivoted fashion by a rotational axis 14. Each brake pedal 10, 12 acts upon a<br>
corresponding brake piston 16 18, with both brake pistons 16. 18 being arranged in a common<br>
brake valve housing 20. The brake pedals 10, 12 can be operated independently of one another.<br>
However, the brake pedals can also be connected with the aid of a connecting bar 21 in such a<br>
way that, when operating one brake pedal 10, 12t the other brake pedal 10, 12 is also actuated,<br>
i.e., both brake pistons 16, 18 are actuated simultaneously.<br>
Transverse brackets 22, 24 which respectively accommodate one set screw 26, 28 are<br>
integrally formed onto the upper free end of each brake pedal 10, 12. The set screws 26, 28 can<br>
be turned in order to adjust how far they protrude out of the respective brackets 22, 24. This<br>
allows an adaptation to the trigger elements of the pedal displacement sensor. The set screws 26,<br>
28 can be conventionally fixed in their respective positions by means of locknuts, not shown. A<br>
pedal displacement sensor 30, which is illustrated in the form of an oblique representation in<br>
Figure 2, is attached to the brake valve housing 20 at the height of the brackets 22, 24 by means<br>
of two screws.<br>
The housing 32 of the pedal displacement sensor consists of a pot-shaped base part 32a<br>
and a cover 32b that can be fixed to the base part 32a by means of two screws 34 and<br>
hermetically seals the base part 32a with the aid of a seal, not shown. The cover may also be<br>
welded to the base part.<br>
Two essentially identical actuating levers 38 are supported in the sensor housing 32 such<br>
that they can be pivoted about a rotational axis 36, with only one actuating lever being visible in<br>
Figure 3. The actuating lever 38 is realized in the form of an angle lever and contains a first arm<br>
40 at the free end region of which the actuating lever 38 is supported such that it can be rotated<br>
about a rotational axis 36. The second arm 42 of the angle lever protrudes out of the sensor<br>
housing 32 through an opening 44 in the housing. The two arms 40,42 form an angle of nearly<br>
90°<br>
For reasons of material savings and weight reduction, the angle lever 38 contains cavities<br>
that are not illustrated in detail. In the vicinity of the bend 68, the angle lever contains a recess<br>
50 into which one end of a helical compression spring 52 engages. The other end of this<br>
compression spring is braced on an intermediate wall 48 of the sensor housing 32. The<br>
compression spring 52 presses the second arm 42 outward through the opening 44 in the sensor<br>
housing 32 such that the end face 46 of the second arm 42 makes contact with the corresponding<br>
set screw 26, 28. The second arm 42 is aligned such that its center line 49 approximately<br>
intersects the center of the end face 46 of the second arm 42 and is directed toward the actuating<br>
element 58 of a switching element 56<br>
A flexible rubber collar 54 that seals the sensor housing 32 relative to the second arm 42<br>
of the angle lever 38 is provided within the region of the opening 44 in the housing. However,<br>
the rubber collar 54 allows a sufficient movement of the angle lever 38.<br>
One microswitch 56 that is mounted in the interior of the housing is respectively assigned<br>
to each of the two actuating levers 38, with only one microswitch being invisible in Figure 3.<br>
The microswitch 56 contains a pushbutton 58., actuation of which makes it possible to influence<br>
the switching state of the microswitch 56. The pushbutton 58 is situated in the vicinity of the<br>
bend 68 of the actuating lever 38.<br>
Figure 4 shows in greater detail that the actuating lever 38 contains a spring tongue 60<br>
that is integrally formed onto the actuating lever in the vicinity of the rotational axis 36 and<br>
essentially extends parallel to the first arm 40. The free end of the spring tongue 60 contains a<br>
contact surface 62 that is situated opposite the pushbutton 58 and is pressed against the<br>
pushbutton 58- when the corresponding brake pedal 10, 12 is- operated, such that a switching<br>
function of the microswitch 56 is triggered. An edge 64 of the housing that limits the excursion<br>
of the spring tongue 60 and thus protects the pushbutton 58 from excessively high loads, is<br>
situated opposite the free end of the spring tongue 60. The stroke of the actuating lever 38 is<br>
limited by an inner housing wall 66, against which the region of the bend 68 impacts during full<br>
actuation of the actuating lever 38. This measure also serves to preventing damage<br>
The actuating lever 3-8 is realized in a cylindrical fashion within the region of the<br>
rotational axis 36. A recess, in which a permanent magnet 114 is arranged, is situated in a<br>
cylindrical end section 112 The permanent magnet 114 is arranged in such a way that a line 116<br>
that connects the magnetic north pole N and the magnetic south pole S extends perpendicular to<br>
the rotational axis 36. A Hall sensor 118, with electric supply lines 122, is mounted in the sensor<br>
housing 32 in the vicinity of the permanent magnet 114 The Hall sensor 118 is arranged<br>
approximately in the mid-plane 120 that extends between the magnetic north pole N and the<br>
magnetic south pole S of the permanent magnet 114.<br>
In addition to the aforementioned components, other not-shown electrical components,<br>
e.g., relays and printed circuit boards, may also be accommodated in the sensor housing 32. At<br>
least one hermetically sealed lead-through for electric lines, which is not illustrated in greater<br>
detail, is situated in the housing wall The lines connect the electrical components in the interior<br>
of the sensor housing 32 to the plug contacts of a plug, not shown, that is integrated into the<br>
sensor housing 32. A motor vehicle wiring harness can be connected to this plug.<br>
The electric circuit shown in Figure 5 that is arranged within the housing 32 of the pedal<br>
displacement sensor is indicated in Figure 5 by a broken line 72. The components, which are<br>
illustrated in the form of conventional symbols, e.g., switches, Hall sensors, relays, resistors and<br>
capacitors, may be mounted on an printed electrical circuit board, not illustrated in greater<br>
detail, and arranged in the sensor housing 32.<br>
The circuit shown contains two brake pedal switches 74, 76 that correspond to the<br>
microswitch 56 shown in Figure 3 and are respectively assigned to one of two brake pedals 10<br>
12. A battery lead 78 of the brake pedal switches 74, 76 is connected to the motor vehicle<br>
battery, not shown. In the idle position of the brake pedal switches 74, 76 illustrated, i.e., when<br>
the brake pedals 10, 12 are not actuated, the battery lead 78 is connected via the brake pedal<br>
switches 74, 76 to a relay 80, the second connection 82 of which is grounded. The relay 80<br>
actuates a switch 84 that connects the battery lead 78 to a brake<br>
valve relay 86 assigned to the air pressure brakes of a trailer<br>
not shown.<br>
When both brake pedal switches 74, 76 change over due to an<br>
actuation of the brake pedals 10, 12, the relay 80 drops and<br>
changes over the switch 84 such that the battery lead 78 is<br>
connected to the brake lights 88 of the motor vehicle and<br>
supplies the not—shown brake lights of the trailer with a voltage<br>
via a connection 90. When the brake pedals 10, 12 are actuated in<br>
the corresponding brake pedal switch 74, 76 delivers a<br>
corresponding voltage signal to an electric motor vehicle<br>
control, not illustrated in greater detail, via a connection<br>
92,94.<br>
This figure also shows two Hall sensors 118, 119 each of<br>
which is assigned to one brake pedal 10, 12. The Hall sensors<br>
118, 119 are conventionally equipped with resistors and<br>
capacitors and require no additional explanation because a person<br>
skilled in the art is familiar with arrangements of the type. The<br>
Hall sensors 118, 119 are connected to a 5 V voltage source via a<br>
first connection 96 and grounded via a second connection 98. The<br>
output lines 100, 102 of the Hall sensor arrangement are<br>
connected to a motor vehicle control, not shown, that suitably<br>
evaluates the brake pedal position determined by means of the<br>
Hall sensors 118, 119.<br>
Although the invention has only been described with<br>
reference to one embodiment, a person skilled in the art would,<br>
in light of the previous description and the figures, be able to<br>
realize various alternatives, modifications and variations that<br>
fall within the scope of the present invention.<br>
