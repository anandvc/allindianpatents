				<td>STABLE AND BIOVAILABLE COMPOSITIONS OF ISOMERS OF LYCOPENE FOR SKIN AND HAIR<br>
The present invention relates to a primary composition that includes at<br>
least one lycopene-containing material enriched in Z-isomers of the lycopene<br>
compound having an increased stability and bioavailability, and process of<br>
forming the same. It also relates to an oral composition that contains the<br>
primary composition in a foodstuff, in a food supplement, in a cosmetic<br>
preparation or in a pharmaceutical preparation.<br>
Technological background<br>
Absorption of carotenoids is a complex process involving release from<br>
the food microstructure matrix, dissolution into mixed micelles, intestinal<br>
uptake, incorporation into chylomicrons, distribution to the tissues, uptake by<br>
liver and re-secretion into VLDL, which are progressively transformed into<br>
LDL.<br>
Lycopene absorption from food sources is widely documented.<br>
Lycopene bioavailability is quite low from foods such as tomatoes and tomato<br>
juice. Up to now, tomato paste is the best known food source for bioavailable<br>
lycopene. Tomato contains about &gt; 90% of lycopene in its all E configuration.<br>
Tomato extracts containing a high amount of lycopene are<br>
commercially available in the form of oleoresin but the bioavailability of the<br>
lycopene in humans is rather limited from these sources. In concentrated<br>
tomato extracts, lycopene is mainly present in crystalline form, which has<br>
been suggested to be one of the primary factors that reduces its<br>
bioavailability.<br>
To date, most commercially available lycopene sources display an<br>
isomeric profile quite similar to the starting tomatoes or show only a slight<br>
increase in Z-isomers, whether they are derivatives (such as sauces) or<br><br>
extracts. A number of treatments, as for instance thermal processing, are<br>
known to promote isomerization,. Shi et al., Journal of Food Process<br>
Engineering 2003, 25, 485-498, showed that an increase in Z isomers could<br>
be obtained by heating tomato sauces. However certain lycopene isomers<br>
are not stable and prone to retro-isomerisation. According to the literature, 5-<br>
Z is the most stable among the predominant lycopene isomers followed by<br>
the all-E, the 9-Z and the 13-Z. Accordingly, the stability of isomerised<br>
lycopene based products depends on their lycopene isomer profile and thus<br>
can be modulated by technological processings affecting this profile.<br>
Thermal isomerisation of lycopene is known to improve its<br>
bioavailability from food matrices. However, the bioavailability of individual<br>
lycopene isomers has not been investigated yet. As for stability, it can be<br>
assumed that bioavailability of lycopene based products is dependent on<br>
their lycopene isomer profile and thereby can be modulated by technological<br>
means.<br>
There are already patents that propose technological means and<br>
formulations for improved bioavailibility of lycopene. For example, WO<br>
2005/075575 provides a primary composition enriched in Z-isomers, effective<br>
to increase the bioavailability of lycopene.<br>
EP 1 103 579 discloses a process for extracting lycopene by refluxing<br>
ethanol: the process is carried out for short time (30') so that no significant<br>
isomerization occurs. Actually, the natural all- Z lycopene is desired as the<br>
final product.<br>
WO 96/13178 discloses a process for the preparation of stable<br>
lycopene concentrates: the effect of isomerization on stability is not however<br>
appreciated and, on the contrary, the disclosed process tries to avoid<br>
isomerization by using temperatures lower than 50Â°C for a few minutes, e.g.<br>
10 minutes.<br><br>
EP 1 201 762 refers to a lycopene-containg product wherein lycopene<br>
is in its natural all-trans form. No significant isomerisation takes place since<br>
any heat treatment (dissolution and concentration) is carried out for the<br>
shortest possible time (less than 1 hour).<br>
KR 2005 006592 discloses the preparation of a lycopene-zinc complex<br>
having increased anti-oxidant activity. Hating is applied in the absence of<br>
solvents to break the cell walls of the plant material. No prolonged heating<br>
and no isomerization occurs.<br>
WO 03/079816 discloses a process for the preparation of tomato<br>
extracts with high content in lycopene wherein the extraction is carried out at<br>
room temperature.<br>
US 5,837,311 and WO 97/48287 disclose a process for the preparation<br>
of an oleoresin having high content of lycopene and satisfactory stability. The<br>
latter feature is obtained by means of phospholipids and glycerides present<br>
in the oleoresin itself. No mention is made about the isomeric composition of<br>
lycopene and of its influence on the stability. An hot extraction is carried out<br>
in order to maximise the yield in lycopene but for times not longer than 1.2<br>
hours. A heat pre-treatment is carried out on the tomatoes in the absence of<br>
any solvent only in order to improve the pulp-serum separation.<br>
WO 2005/075575 addresses the problem of increasing the cis-isomers<br>
content in tomato oleoresins: isomerization is obtained, inter alia, by thermal<br>
treatment for short period of time. Moreover, the obtained product contains<br>
an high amount of the unstable 13-cis isomer.<br>
EP 0 937 412 discloses a process for the preparation of finely divided<br>
pulverous carotenoid preparations including an heating step in the presence<br>
of solvents for very short times (5 seconds).<br>
US 5,858,700 concerns a process for the isolation and purification of<br>
lycopene crystals characterised by the hydrolysis of impurities such as<br><br>
glycerides and phosphonates. The hydrolysis is carried out at high<br>
temperature but for times shorter than 2 hours, optionally preceded by an<br>
extraction step with refluxing solvents, but always for short time in order to<br>
prevent the lycopene degradation.<br>
US 6,235,315 discloses stable, pulverulent lycopene formulations<br>
characterised in that lycopene has a certain degree of crystallinity and the<br>
lowest possible degree of isomerization.<br>
WO 03/090554 discloses concentrated tomato derivatives having high<br>
content of lycopene and pre-determined viscosity and sugar content. The<br>
process is physical and no solvent is used. Heating for 1-6 minutes II is<br>
carried out on round tomatoes in order to make the pulp separation easier.<br>
Mayer-Miebach at al., "Thermal processing of carrots: lycopene<br>
stability and isomerisation with regard to antioxidant potential" Food<br>
Research International, Elsevier Applied Science, Barking, GB, vol. 38, no. 8-<br>
9, October 2005, pages 1103-1108, study the isomerisation of lycopene in<br>
freeze-dried carrots in function of temperature. The Authors conclude that<br>
only the all-trans isomer is stable to prolonged heating, resulting in a<br>
decrease of cis-isomers.<br>
As a matter of fact, therefore, the prior art does not provide<br>
isomerisation processes of lycopene comprising a prolonged heating in<br>
organic solvents allowing to obtain a product having high bioavailability and<br>
stable isomeric composition.<br>
Summary<br>
It has been found that the stability of individual Z-lycopene isomers<br>
varies from one isomer to another; in particular the 13-Z lycopene was much<br>
less stable than either the 5-Z, or the 9-Z, or the all-E isomers.<br>
Consequently, a primary composition according to the present invention must<br>
have a level of 13-Z isomer as low as possible to exhibit optimal stability. It<br><br>
has also been shown that some Z isomers (such as 5-Z and 9-Z, for<br>
example) of lycopene enhance the bioavailability of the composition<br>
containing lycopene. The primary composition must therefore contain mainly<br>
the 5-Z isomer, or a combination of 9-Z and 5-Z isomers to provide an<br>
improved bioavailability and bioefficacy.<br>
Accordingly, it is a first object of the present invention to provide<br>
primary compositions with at least one lycopene-containing material enriched<br>
in a specific mixture of Z isomers of lycopene, the lycopene-containing<br>
material containing by weight a greater percentage of an isomer selected<br>
from the group consisting of 5-Z, 9-Z and combinations thereof than of 13-Z<br>
isomer.<br>
In an embodiment, the present invention provides an oral composition<br>
that contains the primary composition in a foodstuff, in a food supplement, in<br>
a cosmetic preparation or in a pharmaceutical preparation.<br>
In an embodiment, the present invention provides the primary<br>
composition as an additive in a foodstuff for oral administration, such as in a<br>
nutritional composition, a food supplement, a pet food product, a cosmetic<br>
preparation or a pharmaceutical preparation.<br>
In an embodiment, the present invention provides a method of<br>
manufacturing the primary compositions or food supplements, cosmetic<br>
preparations or pharmaceutical preparations containing the same.<br>
In another embodiment, the present invention provides the use of the<br>
primary composition as described above, for the preparation of an oral,<br>
cosmetic or pharmaceutical composition intended for improving skin health,<br>
in particular for photoprotection of the skin or for protecting skin tissue<br>
against aging.<br>
In an alternative embodiment, the present invention provides the use<br>
of the primary compositions for the preparation of an oral, cosmetic or<br><br>
pharmaceutical composition for preventing or treating cardiovascular<br>
diseases or cancers.<br>
An advantage of the present invention is to provide compositions of Z<br>
isomers of lycopene that exhibit a higher stability, bioavailability and<br>
bioefficacy.<br>
Additional features and advantages are described herein, and will be<br>
apparent from, the following Detailed Description and the Figure.<br>
Brief description of the figure<br>
FIGURE. Area under the curve (AUC) of plasma lycopene/triglycerides<br>
of TRL following the consumption of a standard meal containing 25 mg total<br>
lycopene from either tomato paste (all-E lycopene) or tomato oleoresin rich in<br>
5-Z lycopene (5-Z oleoresin) or tomato oleoresin rich in 13-Z lycopene (13-Z<br>
oleoresin) or tomato oleoresin rich in 9 and 13-Z lycopene (9- &amp; 13-Z<br>
oleoresin).<br>
Detailed description of the invention<br>
The present invention generally relates to compositions that provide<br>
health benefits. More specifically, the present invention relates to beneficial<br>
nutritional compositions that can be used to improve skin and hair and<br>
methods regarding the same.<br>
The present invention now makes available to the consumer an<br>
improved composition obtained from natural products. The primary<br>
composition provides lycopene in a particularly highly bioavailable and/or<br>
bioeffective form.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the invention provides tomato extracts or<br>
derivatives thereof with an isomer ratio different from the naturally occurring<br>
one in products to date available. In particular, the invention relates to<br>
extracts or derivatives with an E isomer content not higher than 60% on total<br>
lycopene content, preferably with an E isomer content not higher than 40%<br><br><br>
on total lycopene content (by HPLC).<br>
In an embodiment, the present invention provides a primary<br>
composition containing a specific combination of Z isomers. Preferably, the<br>
ratio of Z/E isomers in the primary compositions of the present invention<br>
should be above 1.<br>
Moreover, the combination is preferably rich in 5-Z and 9-Z and poor in<br>
13-Z. In a preferred embodiment, the amount of 5-Z and 9-Z is greater than<br>
30% on total lycopene content, preferably greater than 40%, most preferably<br>
greater than 50%. Also, the amount of 13-Z is less than 10% on total<br>
lycopene, preferably less than 5%, most preferably less than 3% on total<br>
lycopene content. By increasing the specific 5-Z and 9-Z isomers and/or<br>
decreasing the 13-Z isomers, for example, a stable form of the primary<br>
composition that is more bioavailable and more bioeffective can be obtained.<br>
Moreover, the extracts or derivatives of the invention are stable under the<br>
usual storage conditions and do not undergo retro-isomerization. Under<br>
ordinary protective conditions (absence of light and oxygen), the lycopene<br>
total content and E isomer content remains constant. The latter does not<br>
increase, even when keeping the extracts at room temperature.<br>
Such a profile (i.e. low amount of 13-Z isomer of the lycopene) may be<br>
for example obtained by isomerizing lycopene using catalysis on a solid<br>
matrix such as clays, or by prolonged heating.<br>
In an embodiment, the lycopene-containing material can be, for<br>
example, in the form of an extract, a concentrate or an oleoresin. In the<br>
present specification, the term "oleoresin" should be understood to mean a<br>
lipid extract of a lycopene -containing material, which includes possibly other<br>
carotenoids, triglycerides, phospholipids, tocopherols, tocotrienols,<br>
phytosterols and other less significant compounds. It has been surprisingly<br>
found that retro-isomerization of lycopene in isomerized tomato oleoresin can<br><br>
be minimized by reducing its content in 13-Z isomer.<br>
In an embodiment, the lycopene-containing material can be an extract,<br>
a concentrate or an oleoresin, which is obtained, extracted, enriched or<br>
purified from a plant or vegetable material, a microorganism, a yeast or a<br>
product of animal origin. It is further subjected to a treatment to increase its Z<br>
isomer content of lycopene, as described below.<br>
If the source of lycopene is from plant origin, it may be vegetables,<br>
leaves, flowers, fruits and other parts of the plant. In a preferred<br>
embodiment, the source of lycopene is tomatoes (i.e., whole tomato, tomato<br>
extract, tomato flesh, tomato puree, tomato skin, with or without the seeds).<br>
Suitable plant or vegetable concentrates are obtainable e.g. by drying or<br>
freeze-drying the fresh-cut plants or vegetables or the respective roots, fruits<br>
or seeds thereof and then optionally grinding or granulating the dried<br>
material. Suitable methods of obtaining extracts of the above-mentioned<br>
plants or vegetables are known in the art. The plant or vegetable extracts can<br>
be obtained, for example, by extracting the fresh-cut or processed plants or<br>
vegetables or the respective roots, fruits or seeds thereof with water or with<br>
one or more food grade solvents or with a mixture of water and one or more<br>
food grade solvents. Preferably, the extracts and concentrates according to<br>
the present invention may be lipidic or aqueous. Because carotenoids are<br>
liposoluble, extraction with water will remove unwanted constituents that are<br>
water-soluble such as, for example, sugars, amino acids, soluble proteins<br>
and/or organic acids.<br>
If the lycopene-containing material is obtained from microorganism,<br>
any microorganism that produces lycopene may be used, in particular<br>
probiotic microorganism such as, for example, lactic acid bacterium. Also, the<br>
product of animal origin may be from, for example, salmon, shrimps, krill or a<br>
liver extract or a milk fraction. In the present specification, the term "milk<br><br>
fraction" should be understood to mean any part of the milk.<br>
In an alternative embodiment, the lycopene-containing material can be<br>
an oleoresin. Suitable methods for obtaining oleoresins from the above-<br>
mentioned plants or vegetables are well known in the art. For example,<br>
5 oleoresins can be obtained by lipidic extraction using a solvent compatible<br>
with the food business, cosmetics or Pharmaceuticals. Oleoresins prepared<br>
by conventional methods have a content in lycopene of about 0.05% to 50%<br>
by weight. Their content of all-E isomer of lycopene is usually higher than<br>
that of Z-isomers, e.g. the ratio of Z/E isomers of lycopene in a selected<br>
10 tomato oleoresin is about 7:93.<br>
Oleoresins are preferred starting material for obtaining the primary<br>
composition according to the present invention because they contain other<br>
carotenoids or antioxidants such as Vitamin E, which also stabilize the<br>
composition. The bioactivity and stability of the lycopene compound in the<br>
15 oleoresin can be improved, in particular, during the isomerization process<br>
and the yield of the Z lycopene in the primary composition can also be<br>
increased.<br>
The lycopene-containing material preferably includes carotenes and<br>
xanthophylls such as, for example, zeaxanthine, astaxanthine,<br>
20 beta-cryptoxanthin, capsanthine, canthaxanthine, lutein and derivatives<br>
thereof such as esters, for example. The lycopene compounds have been<br>
subjected to a treatment to increase the Z isomer fraction in the primary<br>
composition.<br>
In order to obtain such an isomer profile, the lycopene-containing<br>
25 material which is in the form of an extract, a concentrate or an oleoresin, is<br>
subjected to an isomerization by using neutral, acidic or basic solid catalysts<br>
(e.g. clays, zeolites, molecular sieves, ion exchangers) to produce mixtures<br>
with high Z/E ratio. The use of solid catalysts to enrich the lycopene in<br><br>
Z-isomers is not polluting and harmful to the food since the catalysts can be<br>
conveniently removed by simple filtration or centrifugation. Also,<br>
combinations of solid catalysts with other common means (e.g. heat, light<br>
and radical initiators) can further enhance the geometrical isomerization.<br>
In another embodiment, the extracts or derivatives according to the<br>
invention can be prepared starting from tomatoes, parts of tomatoes (such as<br>
the skin), derivatives (such as sauces and concentrates) or extracts.<br>
Isomerization is carried out by prolonged heating in a solvent. This finding is<br>
surprising in view of contrary teachings which may be derived from the prior<br>
art discussed in the section "Background of the Invention".<br>
In particular, when tomatoes or derivatives thereof are used as starting<br>
materials, they can be treated with a solvent able to extract lycopene. The<br>
resulting extract is then heated, the solvent is removed, thus recovering the<br>
isomerized extract.<br>
On the other hand, when an extract or derivative is used as starting<br>
material, this is taken up in a solvent, the mixture is heated for a suitable<br>
time, then the solvent is removed, thus recovering the isomerized extract.<br>
Solvents which can be used for the isomerization step are hydrocarbons,<br>
chlorinated hydrocarbons, esters, ketones, alcohols; particularly C3-C10<br>
aliphatic hydrocarbons, C1-C3 chlorinated solvents, C3-C6 esters, C3-C8<br>
ketones and C1-C8 alcohols; more particularly hexane, carbon tetrachloride,<br>
ethyl acetate, acetone and butanol. Isomerization in solvents is carried out at<br>
temperatures ranging from 50 to 150Â°C, preferably at temperatures ranging<br>
from 60 to 130Â°C. Isomerization time ranges from 4 to 240 h, preferably from<br>
10 to 180 h.<br>
The Z/E isomer ratio in the primary composition may then be increased<br>
up to at least 20:80, preferably between 20:80 and 95:5, more preferably<br>
from 30:70 to 90:10. In a preferred embodiment, the (5Z+9Z)/E ratio is above<br><br><br>
1, and the 13Z is partly removed.<br>
In an embodiment, the present invention provides a primary<br>
composition, in the form of a powder, liquid or gel, comprising a lycopene<br>
compound which has a better bioavailability and/or bioefficacy than the<br>
compound alone. Also, the primary composition may be in the form of a<br>
highly water-dispersible composition, if the powder form is chosen. In this<br>
instance, the powder is dispersible in water at ambient temperature. The<br>
primary composition also provides carotenoids in a particularly highly soluble<br>
form in lipids and organic solvents, less prone to crystallization, and having a<br>
lower tendency to aggregate.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the primary<br>
composition may be used either alone or in association with other active<br>
compounds such as vitamin C, vitamin E (tocopherols and tocotrienols),<br>
carotenoids (carotenes, lutein, zeaxanthine, beta-cryptoxanthine, etc.)<br>
ubiquinones (e.g. CoQ10), catechins (e.g. epigallocatechin gallate), coffee<br>
extracts containing polyphenols and/or diterpenes (e.g. kawheol and<br>
cafestol), extracts of chicory, Ginkgo biloba extracts, grape or grape seed<br>
extracts rich in proanthocyanidins, spice extracts (e.g. rosemary), soy<br>
extracts containing isoflavones and related phytoestrogens and other<br>
sources of flavonoids with antioxidant activity, fatty acids (e.g. n-3 fatty<br>
acids), phytosterols, prebiotic fibers, probiotic microorganisms, taurine,<br>
resveratrol, aminoacids, selenium and precursors of glutathione, or proteins<br>
such as, for example, whey proteins.<br>
The primary composition can additionally comprises one or more of<br>
emulsifiers, stabilizers and other additives. Emulsifiers compatible in the food<br>
field are, for example, phospholipids, lecithin, polyoxyethylene sorbitan<br>
mono- or tristearate, monolaurate, monopalmitate, mono- or trioleate; a<br>
mono- or diglyceride. Any type of stabilizer that is known in the food<br><br>
business, in cosmetics or in Pharmaceuticals can be added. Also, flavours,<br>
colorants and any other suitable additives known in the food business, in<br>
cosmetics or in Pharmaceuticals can be added. These emulsifiers, stabilizers<br>
and additives can be added according to the final uses of the primary<br>
compositions.<br>
In an alternative embodiment, the present invention provides an oral<br>
composition comprising the primary composition described above in a<br>
foodstuff, in a food supplement, in a pet food product, in a cosmetic<br>
preparation or in a pharmaceutical preparation.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, a food composition for human consumption<br>
can be supplemented by the primary composition. This food composition may<br>
be, for example, a nutritional complete formula, a dairy product, a chilled or<br>
shelf stable beverage, a mineral water, a liquid drink, a soup, a dietary<br>
supplement, a meal replacement, a nutritional bar, a confectionery, a milk or<br>
a fermented milk product, a yogurt, a milk based powder, an enteral nutrition<br>
product, an infant formulae, an infant nutritional product, a cereal product or<br>
a fermented cereal based product, an ice-cream, a chocolate, coffee, a<br>
culinary product such as mayonnaise, tomato puree or salad dressings or a<br>
pet food.<br>
For use in food compositions, the primary composition can be added to<br>
the above-mentioned foods or drinks so as to have a daily intake between<br>
about 0.001 and 50 mg of lycopene contained in the primary composition. A<br>
daily intake of about 5 to 20 mg per day is preferably envisaged.<br>
The nutritional supplement for oral administration may be in capsules,<br>

symptoms of the disease and its complications. In the present specification,<br>
an amount adequate to accomplish this is defined as "a therapeutically<br>
effective dose". Amounts effective for this will depend on the severity of the<br>
disease and the weight and general state of the patient.<br>
In prophylactic applications, primary compositions according to the<br>
invention can be administered to a patient susceptible to or otherwise at risk<br>
of a particular disease. Such an amount is defined to be "a prophylactic<br>
effective dose". In this use, the precise amounts again depend on the<br>
patient's state of health and weight.<br>
In an alternative embodiment, the primary compositions of the<br>
invention can be administered with a pharmaceutical acceptable carrier, the<br>
nature of the carrier differing with the mode of administration, for example<br>
parenteral, intravenous, oral and topical (including ophthalmic) routes. The<br>
desired formulation can be made using a variety of excipients including, for<br>
example, pharmaceutical grades of mannitol, lactose, starch, magnesium<br>
stearate, sodium saccharin cellulose, magnesium carbonate. The<br>
pharmaceutical compositions may be a tablet, a capsule, a pill, a solution, a<br>
suspension, a syrup, a dried oral supplement, a wet oral supplement.<br>
Preferably, for humans the pharmaceutical compositions according to<br>
the present invention can comprise an amount of the primary composition as<br>

lycopene amount can range from about 0.01 mg to 100 mg.<br>
It will be appreciated that the skilled person will, based on his own<br>
knowledge, select the appropriate components and galenical form to target<br>
the active compound to the tissue of interest, e.g. the skin, colon, stomach,<br>
kidney or liver, taking into account the route of administration which may be<br>
by way of injection, topical application, intranasal administration,<br>
administration by implanted or transdermal sustained release systems, and<br>
the like.<br>
In another embodiment, the present invention provides a cosmetic<br>
composition comprising the primary composition described above. It may be<br>
formulated in lotions, shampoos, creams, sun-screens, after-sun creams,<br>
anti-aging creams and/or ointments, for example. Preferably, the content of<br>
primary composition can be between 10-10% and 10% by weight of the<br>
cosmetic compositions. More preferably, the cosmetic compositions comprise<br>
between 10-8% and 5% by weight of lycopene. The cosmetic compositions<br>
that can be used topically can additionally comprise a fat or an oil which can<br>

and preventing degradation thereof during storage.<br>
It should also be understood that the concepts of the present invention<br><br>
may likewise be applied as an adjuvant therapy assisting in presently used<br>
medications. Because the primary compounds of the present invention may<br>
easily be administered together with food material, special clinical food may<br>
be applied containing a high amount of the primary compositions. It should<br>
be clear that on reading the present specification together with the appending<br>
claims the skilled person will envisage a variety of different alternatives to the<br>
alternative embodiments mentioned herein.<br>
The present invention additionally relates to the use of the primary<br>
composition, or the oral composition or the cosmetic composition<br>
described above for the preparation of a product intended to protect the<br>
tissues of the skin against aging, in particular for inhibiting damage to the<br>
skin and/or mucous membranes by inhibiting collagenases and enhancing<br>
the synthesis of collagen. In fact, the use of the primary composition as<br>
described above, for example, makes it possible to enhance the<br>
bioavailability of the lycopene compound in the body and to slow down the<br>
aging of the skin. The primary compositions may also be useful in the<br>
prevention or treatment of sensible, dry or reactive skins, or for improving<br>
skin density or firmness, for ameliorating skin photoprotection, for<br>
preventing or treating cardiovascular diseases or disorders and cancers.<br>
They have also particular benefits on hair and coat of pet animals, such as<br>
an improved hair or coat density, fibre diameter, colour, oilness,<br>
glossiness and a help to prevent hair or coat loss.<br>
The positive effects of the primary composition of the present<br>
invention on the skin of humans or pets can be measured by using<br>
conventional methods such as, for example, minimal erythemal dose<br>
(MED), colorimetry, transepidermal water loss, DNA repair, measure of<br>
interleukins and proteoglycans production, or collagenase activity, barrier<br>
function or cell renewal or ultrasonic echography.<br><br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Example 1: Study of the stability of lycopene isomers<br>
The stability of lycopene isomers was evaluated both in an organic<br>
solvent and in a tomato extract.<br>
Materials<br>
Lycopene-rich tomato oleoresin has been obtained from Indena s.p.a.<br>
(Milan, Italy). Its total lycopene content amounted to 9.1%, of which the<br>
all-E and the 5-Z isomers represented 93.5% and 6.5%, respectively. Two<br>
isomerized oleoresins were prepared by heating a suspension of tomato<br>
oleoresin in ethyl acetate (1:10 w/w) either for 1 h or for 48 h. After cooling at<br>
room temperature, the suspensions were centrifuged and ethyl acetate in the<br>
recovered supernatants was removed by distillation under reduced pressure.<br>
Di-t-butyl-hydroxy-toluene (BHT) and N-ethyldiisopropylamine were<br>
from Fluka AG. All solvents were HPLC grade and were used without<br>
purification.<br>
Isolation of pure lycopene isomers<br>
Pure 5-Z, 9-Z, 13-Z and all-E lycopene were isolated from isomerised<br>
tomato oleoresin (submitted to 1 hour heating), by collecting the fractions<br>
containing the corresponding peaks after HPLC separation (see below the<br>
experimental conditions). Peaks were collected during two consecutive HPLC<br>
runs and the corresponding fractions were pooled.<br>
Lycopene analysis<br>
Amount of total lycopene was determined by reverse phase HPLC on a<br>
C18 precolumn (ODS Hypersil, 5 Î¼m, 20 x 4 mm; Hewlett Packard, Geneva,<br>
Switzerland) and a C18 column (Nova pak, 3.9 Î¼m i.d. x 300 mm length,<br>
Millipore, Volketswil, Switzerland). The separation was achieved at room<br>
temperature under isocratic conditions with a mobile phase consisting of<br>
acetonitrile/tetrahydrofuran/methanol/ammonium	acetate	1%<br><br>
(533.5:193.6:53.7:28, wt/wt/wt/wt). The mobile phase flow rate was<br>
1.5mL/min.<br>
Lycopene isomer profiles were determined by normal phase HPLC<br>
according to the method described by Schierle et al. (Schierle, J., Bretzel,<br>
W., Buhler, I., Faccin, N., Hess, D., Steiner, K., Schuep, W. (1997). Food.<br>
Chem. 59: 459). Samples of isomerized oleoresins were dissolved in n-<br>
hexane containing 50 ppm BHT and spun at maximum speed in an<br>
Eppendorf Lab centrifuge. The resulting supematants were immediately<br>
analyzed by HPLC. The HPLC system used was a 1100 series Hewlett-<br>
Packard model equipped with an ultraviolet-visible photodiode array detector.<br>
Data were simultaneously acquired at 470 nm, 464 nm, 346 nm and 294 nm.<br>
Samples (10 ul.) were separated using a combination of three Nucleosil 300-<br>
5 columns (4 mm internal diameter x 250 mm length, Macherey-Nagel). The<br>
separation was achieved at room temperature under isocratic condition with<br>
a mobile phase consisting of n-hexane with 0.15% N-ethyldiisopropylamine.<br>
Flow rate was 0.8 mL/min. Lycopene Z-isomers were identified according to<br>
literature data.<br>
Amounts of lycopene isomers were calculated based on surface areas<br>
of the HPLC peaks using the same extinction coefficient as the all-E<br>
lycopene. Therefore, the lycopene concentration in products containing Z-<br>
isomers is slightly underestimated since it is recognized that the extinction<br>
coefficients of Z-isomers are lower than that of the all-E isomer.<br>
Conditions for stability tests<br>
Stability of lycopene isomers was investigated both in n-hexane and in<br>
a tomato oleoresin isomerized by 4 hour heating in ethyl acetate. For this<br>
purpose, pure lycopene isomers were stored for 33 days in n-hexane at room<br>
temperature and in the absence of light, and the isomerized tomato oleoresin<br>
was kept for 55 days at room temperature in the absence of light. Total<br><br>
lycopene concentration and lycopene isomer profiles were measured at<br>
various time intervals during the storage.<br>
Results<br>
Stability of lycopene isomers in n-hexane<br>
Results of the stability test of pure lycopene isomers during storage in<br>
n-hexane at room temperature in the absence of light are reported Table 1.<br>
All isomers, i.e. included the all-E isomer, underwent a geometrical<br>
isomerization during storage. The 13-Z was the less stable isomer: whereas<br>
less than 50% of 5-Z, 9-Z and all-E lycopene were transformed after 33 day<br>
storage, more than 80% of 13-Z lycopene was converted into other isomers<br>
during this period of time. Also, the transformation pathway was different for<br>
the 13-Z lycopene compared to the other Z-isomers: while the 13-Z isomer<br>
was mainly converted into the all-E isomer, the 5-Z and 9-Z isomers were<br>
principally transformed into other Z-isomers during storage in n-hexane.<br>
Table 1: Stability of pure lycopene isomers in n-hexane during storage<br>
at room temperature<br><br><br><br>
Stability of lycopene isomers in tomato oleoresin<br>
Results of the stability test of lycopene isomers in a tomato oleoresin<br>
heated for 48 hours in ethyl acetate are reported in Table 2.<br>
Table 2: Stability of lycopene isomers in isomerized tomato oleoresin<br>
during storage at room temperature (n = 2).<br><br>
Total lycopene content was stable during storage at room temperature.<br>
However, the lycopene isomer profile markedly changed with a decrease of<br>
13-Z lycopene content and an increase of the all-E lycopene. The content of<br>
9-Z and 5-Z lycopene remained stable during the storage period.<br><br>
Conclusion<br>
Both stability tests have shown that the 13-Z lycopene was much less<br>
stable than either the 5-Z, or the 9-Z, or the all-E isomers. Consequently, an<br>
isomerized tomato oleoresin with a low level of 13-Z lycopene should exhibit<br>
a good stability of its lycopene isomer profile.<br>
Example 2: Isomerized tomato oleoresin with increased bioavailability<br>
Objective:<br>
The objective of the present work was to investigate the bioavailability<br>
of various Z-lycopene isomers in humans. To elucidate the bioavailability of<br>
specific Z-lycopene isomer in human, tomato oleoresins have been enriched<br>
in different Z-lycopene isomers reaching about 60% of the content of total<br>
lycopene i.e. one rich in 5-Z lycopene, another one rich in 13-Z lycopene and<br>
the last one rich in a mixture of 9-Z lycopene and 13-Z lycopene.<br>
Material and Method<br>
Subject<br>
Thirty healthy men were enrolled in the study. The inclusion criteria<br>
were that the subjects should be nonvegetarians and nonsmokers and that<br>
they have no metabolic disorders such as diabete; hypertension; renal,<br>
hepatic, or pancreatic disease; or ulcers. Subjects were normolipidemic, i.e.<br>
they had a ratio of plasma cholesterol to HDL cholesterol 
triacylglycerol (TAG) concentrations 
amount of blood that was drawn during the study, subjects were required to<br>
have a blood hemoglobin concentration &gt; 13 g/dL. Subjects were excluded<br>
from the study if they used cholesterol-altering medication or hypolidemic<br>
treatment or vitamin and mineral supplements from 3 months before the start<br>
of the study until the completion of the study or had had major<br>
gastrointestinal surgery; exercised intensively, such as running marathons;<br>
and consumed daily &gt; 2 glasses of wine (3 dL), &gt; 2 beers (3 dL), or &gt; 1 glass<br><br>
(shot glass) of hard liquor. Twenty-seven of the 30 volunteers completed the<br>
4 post-prandial tests. Three volunteers abandoned the trial before the end for<br>
the following reasons: unavailability, medical treatment related to an eye<br>
injury, nausea related to the consumption of fatty meals. Subjects were 24 Â±<br>
1 y old with a body weight of 70 Â± 1 kg and body mass index (BMI) of 22.5 Â±<br>
0.3 kg/cm2.<br>
The protocol was approved by the ethical committee of Marseille<br>
(Marseille, France). Subjects received information on the background and<br>
design of the study and gave written informed consent before participation.<br>
They were free to withdraw from the study at any time.<br>
Study design<br>
This was a double-blind, randomized, 4-periods, 4-treatments cross-<br>
over clinical trial with a washout period of 3 weeks minimum. After an<br>
overnight fast, subjects arrived at the Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutic<br>
Trial Center of University of Marseille and consumed a standard meal<br>
consisting of 25 mg lycopene incorporated in 40 g peanut oil that was mixed<br>
with 70 g wheat semolina (cooked with 200 mL tap water). In addition, they<br>
consumed 40 g bread, 60 g cooked egg whites, a 125 g yoghurt containing 5<br>
g of white sugar and drank 330 mL of water (Aquarel, Nestle). This standard<br>
meal provided 842 kcal (3520 kJ) with the following nutrient composition:<br>
protein (11.7%), carbohydrates (39.3%) and lipids (49.0%). This meal was<br>
consumed within 15 min. No other food was allowed over the subsequent 6<br>
h, but subjects were allowed to drink up to a bottled water (330 ml) during the<br>
last 3h post-absorption (Aquarel, Nestle).<br>
Lycopene supplements<br>
Four different tomato products were tested providing each one 25 mg<br>
of total lycopene. They consisted of:<br>
â¢ Tomato paste (Thorny, Switzerland) containing lycopene mostly in<br><br>
all-E configuration<br>
â¢	Tomato oleoresin enriched in 5-Z lycopene<br>
â¢	Tomato oleoresin enriched with 13-Z lycopene<br>
Tomato oleoresin enriched with a mixture of 9-Z and 13-Z lycopene<br>
Table 3 presents the lycopene content as well as the lycopene isomer<br>
profile of these four tomato products.<br>

isomers in the four tomato products<br><br>

calculated from the corresponding peak areas in the HPLC chromatogram.<br>
Collection of blood samples<br>
Fasting blood was drawn from an anticubital vein by venipuncture into<br>
an evacuated tube containing potassium EDTA/K3 that was immediately<br>
placed in an ice-water bath and covered with an aluminium foil to avoid light<br>
exposure. Fasting blood samples were collected before i.e. 20 minutes and 5<br>
minutes before consumption of the standard meal as well as 2h, 3h, 4h, 5h,<br>
6h post-absorption. The tube containing the blood was protected from light,<br>
stored at 4Â°C and then centrifuged within 2h (10 min, 4Â°C, 2.800 rpm) to<br>
separate the plasma. A cocktail of inhibitors (10 Î¼L/mL) was added (Cardin et<br>
al., Degradation of apolipoprotein B-100 of human plasma low density<br>
lipoproteins by tissue and plasma kallikreins, Bio Chem 1984; 259:8522-8.).<br>
Isolation of plasma triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRL)<br><br>
After consumption of a fatty meal, dietary lipophilic molecules are<br>
incorporated into chylomicrons, which are secreted into blood. Lipoproteins<br>
are separated by ultracentrifugation methodology based on their density. Due<br>
to the quite similar density of chylomicrons (0.95 g/ml) and VLDL<br>
(1.006 g/ml), it is not possible to separate one from the other and they are<br>
collected altogether in a fraction called triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRL).<br>
However, in the post-prandial state, this plasma TRL fraction contains mainly<br>
chylomicrons secreted from the intestine, which is a good assessment of the<br>
intestinal bioavailability.<br>
Triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRL) containing mainly chylomicrons<br>
with little amount of VLDL were immediately isolated by ultracentrifugation as<br>
follows: 6 mL of plasma were overlaid with a 0.9% NaCI solution and<br>
ultracentrifuged for 28 min at 32.000 rpm, at 10Â°C in a SW41TI rotor<br>
(Beckman), in a L7 ultracentrifuge (Beckman). Immediately after<br>
centrifugation, the TRL were aliquoted and stored at -80Â°C before analytical<br>
determinations. Lycopene analyses were performed within 10 days, and<br>
triacylglycerol analyses within 30 days.<br>
Analytical determination<br>
Triglycerides were assayed by an enzymatic and colorimetric method<br>
using a commercial kit (Kit Bio-Merieux).<br>
Total lycopene and lycopene isomer profiles were determined by<br>
reverse phase and normal phase HPLC method, respectively (M. Richelle,<br>
K. Bortlik, S. Liardet, C. Hager, P. Lambelet, L.A. Applegate, E.A. Offord,<br>
J. Nutr. (2002) 132, 404-408.). Total lycopene content was calculated as the<br>
sum of the 5-Z, 9-Z, 13-Z, x-Z and all-E-lycopene isomers. Lycopene isomer<br>
was quantified using the extinction coefficient of all-E lycopene since the<br>
exact value for all individual Z-lycopene is still unknown. Profile of lycopene<br>
isomers is determined by the ratio of individual lycopene isomer to total<br><br>
lycopene expressed in percentage.<br>
Statistical analysis<br>
Lycopene bioavailability was assessed by measuring the area under<br>
the lycopene concentration in TRL- time curve (AUC). This area was<br>
calculated over the 0-6 hour period using the trapezoidal method (AUC(0-<br>
6h)). Data are presented as mean Â± SEM. The baseline concentration was<br>
the average of the concentrations measured in the two plasma samples<br>
collected before consumption of the standard meal containing 25 mg<br>
lycopene from the tomato matrix. For each subject and each lycopene<br>
treatment, calculation of the AUC(0-6h) was performed by subtracting the<br>
baseline concentration from the concentration value measured at each time<br>
point post-absorption. If this value was negative, it was considered as zero.<br>
For each treatment, if the distributionof the AUC(o-6h) was normal<br>
(Skewness and Kurtosis tests) with or without logarithmic transformation,<br>
comparison was performed by using a linear mixed model with treatment as<br>
fixed effect and subject as random effect.<br>
All statistical analyses were done with SAS software (version 8.2; SAS<br>
Institute, Cary, NC). The rejection level in statistical tests was equal to 5%.<br>
Results<br>
Lycopene bioavailability<br>
Because the four tomato treatments induced a variation of the extent in<br>
triglyceride secretion, lycopene bioavailability has been normalized using<br>
triglyceride absorption (AUC(o-6h))-<br>
Normalized lycopene bioavailability was markedly different between<br>
the four tomato treatments (Figure).<br>
Surprisingly, lycopene was better bioavailable, by about two times,<br>
from tomato oleoresin rich in 5-Z lycopene than from the other three<br>
treatments, i.e tomato paste, tomato oleoresin rich in 13-Z lycopene as well<br><br>
as tomato oleoresin rich in a mixture of 13-Z and 9-Z lycopene (p
(Figure).<br>
While lycopene was similarly bioavailable from tomato paste as from<br>
the mixture of 13-Z and 9-Z tomato oleoresin.<br>
Lycopene present in 13-Z tomato oleoresin exhibited a slight but<br>
significant lower bioavailability (p
Conclusion<br>
These results indicate that the configuration of the lycopene molecule<br>
affects markedly the trafficking of lycopene within the gastrointestinal tract<br>
and in consequence the amount of lycopene that is absorbed. Lycopene<br>
bioavailability from tomato extract rich in 5-Z lycopene is about double than<br>
that from tomato paste. In contrast, lycopene present in tomato extract rich in<br>
a mixture of 9-Z and 13-Z lycopene is similarly bioavailable to that present in<br>
tomato paste while tomato oleoresin rich in 13-Z lycopene presents a slightly<br>
less bioavailable lycopene. Several authors have already pointed out that the<br>
presence of Z-lycopene in a tomato product is associated with an increase of<br>
lycopene bioavailability. This is the first study demonstrating that the<br>
enhancement of lycopene bioavailability is specifically related to lycopene<br>
configuration, i.e. 5-Z lycopene &gt; 9-Z lycopene &gt; 13-Z lycopene.<br>
Example 3: Extraction and isomerization in ethyl acetate<br>
52 kg of fresh tomatoes containing 100 ppm of lycopene are chopped<br>
and homogenized. Part of the water is distilled off under reduced pressure to<br>
obtain 18 kg of tomato concentrate. This is extracted with 36 I of<br>
watersaturated ethyl acetate; during extraction, the mixture is kept at room<br>
temperature shielded from light and under stirring for 2 hours. The extract is<br>
then separated from the tomato concentrate. The above described procedure<br>
is repeated twice on such tomato concentrate, totally using 108 I of solvent.<br>
The combined extracts are washed in a separatory funnel with 27 I of water.<br><br>
The aqueous phase is then discarded while the organic phase is<br>
concentrated under reduced pressure to obtain a suspension with 10% w/v<br>
dry residue; the dry residue has a total lycopene content of 9.1% w/w and a Z<br>
isomer content of 0.46% w/w. This mixture is refluxed (76Â°C) under stirring<br>
for 7 days before being concentrated to dryness under reduced pressure.<br>
46.8 g of final extract with a total lycopene content of 9% w/w and a Z<br>
isomer content of 5.59% w/w are obtained; in particular, the E isomer content<br>
is 3.41% w/w and the 13-Z isomer content is 0.16% w/w. The HPLC profile of<br>
the extract is reported in the Figure.<br>
Example 4: Extraction and isomerization in hexane<br>
10 kg of fresh tomatoes containing 140 ppm of lycopene are chopped<br>
and homogenized. Part of the water is distilled off under reduced pressure to<br>
obtain 2.5 kg of tomato concentrate, which is extracted with 12.5 I of hexane.<br>
During extraction, the mixture is kept at room temperature shielded from light<br>
and under stirring for 2 hours. The extract is then separated from the tomato<br>
concentrate. The above described procedure is repeated once on such<br>
tomato concentrate, totally using 25 I of solvent. The extracts are combined<br>
and concentrated under reduced pressure to obtain a solution with 10% w/v<br>
dry residue; the dry residue has a total lycopene content of 9.1% w/w and a Z<br>
isomer content of 0.46% w/w. This mixture is refluxed (69Â°C) under stirring<br>
for 6 days before being concentrated to dryness under reduced pressure.<br>
16.5 g of final extract with total lycopene content of 9.1% w/w and Z isomer<br>
content of 5.62% w/w are obtained; in particular, the E isomer content is<br>
3.38% w/w and the 13-Z isomer content is 0.18% w/w.<br>
Example 5: Isomerization in butanol<br>
10 kg of fresh tomatoes containing 90 ppm of lycopene are chopped<br>
and homogenized. Part of the water is distilled off under reduced pressure to<br>
obtain 3.4 kg of tomato concentrate, which is extracted with 7 I of<br><br>
water-saturated ethyl acetate. During extraction, the mixture is kept at room<br>
temperature shielded from light and under stirring for 2 hours. The extract is<br>
then separated from the tomato concentrate. The above described procedure<br>
is repeated twice on such tomato concentrate, totally using 21 I of solvent.<br>
The combined extracts are washed in a separatory funnel with 5.3 I of water.<br>
The aqueous phase is then discarded while the organic phase is<br>
concentrated to dryness under reduced pressure. The dry residue (9.8 g),<br>
which has a total lycopene content of 7.8% w/w and a Z-isomer content of<br>
0.40% w/w, is suspended in 98 ml of n-butanol. The mixture is kept at 130Â°C<br>
under stirring for 4 hours before being concentrated to dryness under<br>
reduced pressure. 9.8 g of final extract with a total lycopene content of<br>
6.35% w/w and a Z-isomer content of 4.50% w/w are obtained; in particular,<br>
the E-isomer content is 1.85% w/w and the 13-Z isomer content is 0.47%<br>
w/w.<br>
Example 6: Isomerization on Solid Catalysts<br>
Materials<br>
Lycopene-rich tomato oleoresin has been obtained from Indena s.p.a.<br>
(Milan, Italy). Its total lycopene content amounted to 9.1%, of which the<br>
all-E and the 5-Z isomers represented 93.5% and 6.5%, respectively.<br>
Methods<br>
A suspension of tomato oleoresin in acetyl acetate (1:100 w/w) was<br>
filtered and incubated with 5% of solid catalyst under constant stirring at<br>
room temperature for 2h. The mixture was centrifuged at maximum speed in<br>
an Eppendorf Lab centrifuge and an aliquot of supernatant evaporated under<br>
N2 and re-suspended in n-hexane/BHT.<br>
Lycopene analysis<br>
Amount of total lycopene and lycopene isomer profiles were<br>
determined by reverse phase and normal phase HPLC, respectively, under<br><br><br><br>
the analytical conditions described in example 1.<br>
Results<br>
Lycopene isomer profiles measured in tomato oleoresin isomerised for<br>
2 h at room temperature using solid catalysts are reported in Table 4.<br>
5	Table 4 Lycopene isomer profiles in tomato oleoresins isomerised<br>
using solid catalysts<br><br>
* unknown lycopene isomers<br>
Lycopene was efficiently isomerised during 2 h reaction in ethyl<br>
10 acetate at room temperature in the presence of either Tonsil Optimum or<br>
Amberlyst 15. With both catalysts a large fraction of lycopene all-E isomer<br>
was converted into Z-isomers. Among the identified lycopene isomers, the 5-<br>
Z was majoritairement formed, followed by the 9-Z and the 13-Z,<br>
respectively; thus, concentration of the 13-Z isomer was, thus, below 10% in<br>
15 the isomerised tomato oleoresins.<br><br>
