THE PATENTS ACT,   1970 [39 OF 1970]<br>
COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10, Rule 13]<br>
"A PROCESS FOR PREPARING A NOVEL MEDICAMENT MIXTURE"<br>
I, SULEIMAN DADO, an Austrian citizen of Landstrasse Hauptstrasse 2, Inder Hilton-Passage, A-1030 Wien, Austria,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br>
The present invention relates to a process for preparing a novel medicament mixture.<br>
The invention relates to the topical use of a sub¬stance mixture comprising honey and olive oil.<br>
"Topical" here means the local, external treatment of skin parts. By applying a substance or a substance mixture onto the area to be treated, the ingredients can directly penetrate at the diseased location and act there. The alleviating and healing properties thus can become active immediately and precisely localized.<br>
Agents presently in use for the treatment of hem¬orrhoids (node-shaped enlargement of the branches of the arteria or vena rectalis sup, in the region of the corpora cavernosa recti supplied with arterial or ve¬nous blood) very often contain corticoids whose use, however, on account of the severe side effects, in¬volves great difficulties and risks. At present, there also exist some corticoid-free medicaments, such as Acetonal-Hamorrhoidal®, Hadensa®, Mucotherm-Zapfchen® (suppositories), Sperti Preparation® or Sulgan®, to mention but a few, wherein a hypersensitivity to one of the components of these preparations may occur with any one of them. With the two last mentioned medicaments, however, also allergic reactions may occur. Further¬more, these agents do not lead to a quick and certain healing, but in most cases have an alleviating effect only.<br><br><br>
The loss of hair may have various causes, it may, e.g., be caused by old age, or it may be a consequence of radiation or chemotherapy in tumour treatment. Dan-druff may be caused by external influences or by inter-nal or infectious diseases. A number of agents have been described for hair and scalp care, such as, e.g. capsules to be swallowed, electrical pulses for acti¬vating cell functions, hair lotions, shampoos or hair packs. These treatments have to be carried out over longer periods of time and often have side effects or lead to counter-reactions or remain unsuccessful, re¬spectively.<br>
Skin problems may have the most varying causes, such as damaging environmental influences (sun, air pollution), allergies, hormonal imbalance, bad eating habits, the taking of medicaments (antibiotics), wounds etc., and they occur more and more frequently. Many creams are aggressive, damage the sensitive skin parts and dehydrate them.<br>
Varicose veins (primary or secondary varicosis) form on account of a mechanical impediment in the ve¬nous flow-back of blood and the peripheral venous pres¬sure increased thereby, surface varices and deep varices with congestion phenomena forming. The causes therefor may be a slowed circulation (e.g. in case of longer confinement to bed), constitutionally caused as a consequence of a congenital connective tissue weak-<br><br>
ness or as a consequence of other vein diseases. For local treatment, in most instances creams, ointments, gels and the like are used which contain heparin. Hepa¬rin has an antithrombotic effect due to its function as a catalyst, by inhibiting the serine proteases in the coagulation cascade. Thereby, a series of blood coagu¬lation factors are inactivated. Yet in case of a ten¬dency to bleeding and in case of thrombocytopenias, heparin must not be used. Furthermore, it should not get into contact with open wounds, the eyes or the mu¬cous membranes. Besides, counter-reactions may occur easily on account of an hypersensitivity to heparin.<br>
It is thus the object of the present invention to provide an agent for topical application which has a broad application spectrum and thus may be employed for a plurality of uses, which, however, also is composed of complex components which are as close to natural as possible, and thus is well tolerable without any nega¬tive side effects. A further object of the present in¬vention consists in providing a completely new, natural and effective agent for treating hemorrhoidal diseases. A further object of the present invention consists in providing an agent against loss of hair. Still another object of the present invention is the provision of a topically usable agent for treating skin problems, such as e.g., wrinkle formation, acne, impure skin, sun burn, wounds etc., as well as an agent for fighting<br><br>
varicose veins.<br>
According to the present invention there is provided a process for preparing a novel medicament mixture characterized by the step of mixing 50-90% of honey, 5-20% of olive oil and optionally one or more of: beeswax, propolis, camomile, sage, Aloe vera, thyme, lavender and/or various oils as herein described.<br>
According to the invention, these objects are achieved by the use of a substance mixture comprising honey and olive oil for preparing a medicament for topical application. With the use according to the in¬vention, the per se known healing effects of honey and olive oil can be utilized, the therapeutical effects being increased in the topical application in synergis-tic manner.<br>
By application on the skin to be treated, the in¬gredients can unfold their effect directly at the de¬sired site and can quickly lead to a sure healing success. By the fact that the substance mixture accord-ing to the invention contains purely natural sub-stances, the application is without contraindications and adverse side-effects, in contrast to synthetically produced medicaments which frequently contain chemi¬cally produced substances in unnaturally high concen¬trations and of which the use is not without risks.<br>
In this instance, the treatment is based on the action of purely natural substances, whereby the risk of counter-reactions of any type, e.g. allergies, hy-persensitivity to ingredients and the like, is greatly reduced. Furthermore, the hemorrhoidal disease is to be healed quickly by aid of the substance mixture accord¬ing to the invention, and not merely alleviated, as is frequently the case with the present medicaments.<br><br>
Although honey and olive oil alone or in the form of substance mixtures together with other substances are already known in the medical science, yet so far a mixture of honey and olive oil has never been used in topical treatment.<br>
Because of its various and extensive healing and alleviating effects, honey has been used in the art of healing for many centuries.<br>
There is a large variety of different types of honey which, depending on their ingredients, have dif¬ferent properties as regards their application in the medical field. The main component of honey is invert sugar, further sugars are cane sugar, maltose, and, de¬pending on the plant species visited, more rarely oc¬curring sugars originating from the latter. Besides, sugar, honey contains further enzymes, such as inver-tase, diastases, catalase, amylase, phosphatase, glu¬cose oxidase, which, with the cooperation of the oxygen of air, convert dextrose into gluconic acid and hydro¬gen peroxide. The latter provides oxygen in an ex¬tremely reactive form which in turn is an excellent germ killer and preservative. One of the mosc important components of honey is pollen. Of the organic acids, malic acid, succinic acid, gluconic acid, acidic acid, formic acid, of the inorganic acids phosphoric acid and hydrochloric acid are present. Honey furthermore con¬tains mineral substances in a portion of up to 3%,<br><br>
among them Fe, Cu, P, S, K, Na, Mg, Ca, Si, Mn, CI, Zn and, in small amounts, also vitamins (Bl, B2, B6, pan¬tothenic acid, nicotinic acid, H, folic acid and little vitamin C) and, in very small amounts, nearly all the amino acids. Furthermore, hormones, acetyl choline, which is involved in the conduction of nerve impulses, inhibines (bactericides) and vegetable dyes, such as flavones or carotines, and aromatic substances (alco¬hols, aldehydes, ketones and essential oils) have been found ("Doktor Biene, Bienenprodukte - ihre Heilkraft und Anwendung" by Paul Uccusic, pp. 45-53, 2nd Edition, 1987, Wilhelm Heyne Verlag, Munich).<br>
Honeydew honeys are rich in resins and essential oils and thus are considerated for all diseases of the respiratory tract (bronchial catarrhs, but also as a supporting treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis and pneumonia), of the urogenital system (cystitis, ure-thriotis, prostatitis) and as a diuretic. Furthermore, a favorable effect can be found in case of gravel and renal calculi. Furthermore, a regulating effect has been postulated in case of problems of the portal cir¬culation (hemorrhoids, congestion of the portal vein, inclination to venous thromboses). Honeys of mixed blossoms have a very favorable effect on allergic per¬sons. Linden honey is sedating and antiseptic. Melissa honey is spasmolytic and sedating. Chestnut honey is generally blood-purifying, fights the tendency to<br><br>
thrombosis, thrombophlebitis and varicose veins, to mention but a few examples from the list of types of honey with the different healing properties ("Doktor Biene", pp. 64-71, supra). Also mixtures of honey and other vegetable substances are described which are ap¬plied for the most varying ailments: e.g., a paste made of equal parts of honey, olive oil and propolis against parodontosis and caries; a mixture of 95% rose honey, 5% borax for wounds, furuncles, exanthemas and eczemas; propolis dissolved in honey is a prevention against flu and running nose; honey and fennel syrup at the ratio of 1:1 helps in case of indigestion, flatulence, heat-burn and constipation. Other known mixtures having a healing effect are honey with wine, honey with lavender or honey with edible chestnuts ("Doktor Biene", pp. 148-165, supra).<br>
Also olive oil has already been used as a natural medicine against various ailments for a long time. De¬pending on its origin and recovery, olive oil contains from 95 to 99% acyl glyceroles, from 0.5 to 1.5% unsa-ponifyable substances and from 0.1 to 3% free fatty ac¬ids, glycerides, secciridoids and flavonoids. The composition of the fatty acid fraction obtainable upon saponification varies in dependence on the origin and degree of ripeness of the olives, oleic acid, palmitic acid and linoleic acid being the main components. Fur¬thermore, phenolic compounds, carbohydrates (mainly<br><br>
squalene), steroles, triterpene alcohols, hydroxy triterpenic acids, tocopheroles, phospholipids, caroti-noids, chlorophyll and pheophytines occur ("Hagars Handbuch der pharmazeutischen Praxis" by R. Hansel, K. Keller, H. Rimpler, G. Schneider (Editors), Vol. 5, Drogen E-0, pp. 940-945, 5th Edition, 1993, Springer Verlag).<br>
According to the prior art, olive oil is, e.g., used in case of cholangitis, cholelithiasis, ikterus, flatulence, meteorism, dysbacteria, Roemheld Syndrome, obstipation and as an intestinal lubricant. Moreover, olive oil has been administered in case of diseases of the biliary tract, for treating ulcers of the stomach and of the intestines, in case of renal calculi, as well as in the form of an  emulsion as a diet rich in nitrogen in case of renal failure. Also for wound care in case of slight burns and in case of psoriasis, for softening the crusts in case of eczemas and as a mas¬sage lubricating oil in aqueous emulsion in case of sun burn, as a massage oil for the treatment of rheumatism as well as in case of hemorrhages, olive oil has been used ("Hagars Handbuch der pharmazeutischen Praxis", supra).<br>
Although, as mentioned above, honey and olive oil have been used for a whole series of healing purposes, it has been shown within the scope of the present in¬vention that by a combination of honey and olive oil in<br><br>
a suitable ratio, these substances have a particularly healing effect which - if applied topically - quickly occurs directly at the site to be treated, and lead to certain success when diseases occurring on or directly under the skin are treated. It has been shown that use of the substance mixture will be particularly suitable if an agent is used which contains from 50-90% of honey. If honey constitutes the major portion of the substance mixture (at least more than one half), its regulating effect is particularly enhanced by the addi¬tion of olive oil, primarily in case of problems of portal circulation (hemorrhoids, congestion of the por¬tal vein, inclination to venous thromboses) and in case of an inclination to thromboses, thrombophlebitis and varicose veins. If honey constitutes approximately 60% of the substance mixture, the maximum healing effect against these ailments seems to be reached. A mixture of honey from blossoms, wild honey, acacia (robinia) honey is suitable.<br>
A particularly advantageous effect of the sub¬stance mixture according to the invention is attained if the mixture contains 5 to 20% of olive oil. An addi-ton of approximately 8.5% of olive oil is optimal.<br>
In the use according to the invention, it is ad¬vantageous to provide a substance mixture comprising additionally one, several or all of the following sub¬stances: beeswax, propolis, camomile, sage. Aloe vera.<br><br>
thyme, lavender and/or diverse oils, such as St.-John's-wort, wheatgerm oil and others.<br>
Beeswax is used in the cosmetic and medical branches for preparing cremes and ointments, where it acts emulsifying. Like honey, propolis and royal jelly, beeswax has therapeutical properties and thus is sub¬stantially better suited for preparing cremes than wax of mineral origin ("Aromatherapie von A-Z" by Patricia Davis, p. 77, 1998, Knaur-Verlag). From the chemical' point of view, waxes consist of fatty acids which are esterified with higher alcohols, propolis, colorants and vitamin A. Wax has always been used as a wound pad and against skin diseases, for enbalming corpses and in odour (aroma) therapy, in cosmetics, wax is used as a component of facial packs or depilatory agents ("Doktor Biene", pp. 136-139, supra).<br>
Propolis has no constant chemical composition. De¬pending on its region of origin, this substance con¬sists of approximately 55% resinous and balm substances, approximately 30% wax, 5 to 10% essential oils, approximately 2 to 5% pollen, vitamins and micro¬elements ("Propolis - Heilkraft aus dem Bienenvolk" by Klaus Nowottnick, pp. 26-31, Leopold Stocker Verlag, 1994). Propolis has comprehensive and highly effective inhibiting and killing actions on numerous bacterial strains, fungicidal properties and has a distinctly vi¬rucidal activity. Moreover, highly anesthesising prop-<br><br><br>
erties could be demonstrated, it is active against in¬digestion, skin diseases and contusions and has tissue-protective and wound-healing properties. In various apitherapy clinics, an overwhelming success has been achieved in case of coronary and circulatory diseases by using a combination of royal jelly with propolis, pollen and pumpkin seeds. Propolis could also cure various diseases of the throat, nose and ear as well as bronchial and lung diseases ("Naturheilung mit Honig -Gesundheit aus der Natur" by Arne Lund, pp. 34-71, Lud-wig Verlag). Many physicians treat varicose veins and peripheral circulatory disturbances, periproctic ab-cesses, hemorrhoids and anal fistulas with propolis ("Doktor Biene", pp. 110-133, supra). These properties can optimally be utilized for the substance mixture of the invention, whereby the healing effect, in particu¬lar in respect of circulatory disturbances, is in¬creased.<br>
Camomile (Chamaemelum, Chamomilla) as a medicinal additive is widely used in the medical field and is also extremely advantageous for the substance mixture according to the invention. The ingredients of camomile substantially are essential oils, sesquiterpenes, hy¬droperoxides, polyphenols, polyines, triterpenes and steroids. The activity of camomile is extensive: anti¬phlogistic, musculotropically spasmolytic, wound heal¬ing promoting, deodorising, antiseptic and dis-<br><br>
infectant, promoting the skin metabolism, to mention but a few properties ("Hagars Handbuch der phar-mazeutischen Industrie", by R. Hansel, K. Keller, H. Rimpler, G. Schneider, Vol. 4, Drogen A-D, pp. 807-830, 5th Edition, 1992, Springer Verlag). By adding camomile to the substance mixture according to the invention, the former acts further pain alleviating, cramp-allevi¬ating, anti-inflammatory, and furthermore, the treat¬ment of hemorrhoids is improved.<br>
Sage (Salvia) contains essential oils, hydroxy cinnamic acids, depsides, flavonoids, di- and triterpe-nes and trace elements. Sage i.a. has antimicrobial, antiviral, antihydrotic, spasmolytic, anti-irritant, antihypertensive, choleretic, central and antidiabetic activities ("Hagars Handbuch der pharmazeutischen Praxis" by R. Hansel, K. Keller, H. Rimpler, G. Schnei¬der, Vol. 6, Drogen P-Z, pp. 538-567, 5th Edition, 1994, Springer Verlag). Due to these manifold proper¬ties, in a preferred embodiment, sage is admixed to the substance mixture, whereby it has an increased anti-in¬flammatory and wound-healing effect.<br>
Aloe vera is the thickened juice of the leaves of Aloe barbadensis, and besides resins, anthranoids, emodin, essential oils and the like, it contains 15-40% aloin, a bitter tasting, yellowish anthron derivative, which is very popular among people as a laxative. Its effect is due to an irritation of the intestinal mucosa<br><br>
and starts already after a few hours. Other ailments are treated by aid of Aloe vera: inflammations of the anus, arteriosklerosis, purulent wounds and injuries, traumatic erysipelas, duodenal ulcer, migrating cheili¬tis, loss of hair, hemorrhoids, varicose veins, dermat-omycoses, for skin care and blood purification ("Aloe Vera - Die Konigin der Heilpflanzen" by Alice Beringer, pp. 13-53, Hyene Biicher, 1997, Wilhelm Hyene Verlag, Miinchen) . In the substance mixture according to the in¬vention, Aloe vera promotes the moisturizing and blood-flow stimulating effects, which has an extremely posi¬tive effect on the diseases to be treated.<br>
The ingredients of thyme (Thymus vulgaris) are es¬sential oils, tannins, phenol carboxylic acids, carbo¬hydrates, triterpenes, aluminum and various biphenyl derivatives. Thyme has antimicrobial, antiviral, insec-ticidal, spasmolytic, wound healing, anthelmintic and antioxidative effects, furthermore thyme inhibits the prostaglandin synthesis and influences the metabolism of medicaments ("Hagars Handbuch der pharmazeutischen Praxis" by R. Hansel, K. Keller, H. Rimpler, G. Schnei¬der, Vol. 6, Drogen P-Z, pp. 974-989, 5th Edition, 1994, Springer Verlag). Therefore, preferably also thyme is admixed to the substance mixture according to the invention, whereby the wound-healing and anti-in¬flammatory action as well as the antipruritic action are enhanced and improved.<br><br>
A further possible and desirable additive to the substance mixture according to the invention is laven¬der (Lavandula). The  ingredients of lavender i.a. are essential oils, tannins, phenyl carboxylic acids. Among the most important actions are chloretic and chola-gogic, hypoglycemic, scar-smoothing, pain-alleviating and spasmolytic, antimicrobial and expectoral ac¬tion ("Hagars Handbuch der pharmazeutischen Praxis" by R. Hansel, K. Keller, H. Rimpler, G. Schneider, Vol. 5, Drogen E-0, pp. 621, 630, 634, 642, 5th Edition, 1993). By the addition of lavender, the substance mixture of the invention is particularly active against hardening of the muscles, wounds which do not heal well, chronic eczemas in the intestinal and anal region as well as for stimulating circulation.<br>
Further oils, such as St. John's wort, almond oil, rose oil or wheatgerm oil, e.g., round off the ingredi¬ents of the preparation.<br>
A particularly favorable effect of the substance mixture is attained if it comprises 10-30%, preferably 18% of beeswax, 1-15%, preferably 5% of propolis, and/or 1-10%, preferably 2% of camomile, and/or 1-10%, preferably 2% of sage, and/or 1-10%, preferably 5.3% of Aloe vera, and/or 0.1-10%, preferably 1% of thyme, and/or 0.01-5%, preferably 0.2% of lavender. By this, the properties of the different substances are opti¬mally utilized because they are harmonized. In doing<br><br>
so, one, several or all of them may be admixed, yet particularly suitable is a substance mixture in which all of them are contained in the portion characterized by "preferably".<br>
An advantageous variant of the substance mixture consists in that it comprises further vegetable sub¬stances, such as, e.g., birch oil, Bois Bondee bark, royal jelly, jasmine, St. John's wort oil, marjoram, myrrh, almond oil, peppermint, pollen, rose oil, rose¬mary, sandalwood, milfoil, wheatgerm oil, cedar oil, cinnamon and/or cypress.<br>
The substance mixture, however, is not restricted to the above-mentioned ingredients, but additional com¬ponents may be added, thus, e.g., further essential oils, vitamins, fatty acids, mineral substances, carbo¬hydrates, organic and inorganic acids and other sub¬stances which advantageously may be admixed if the specific application calls for it.<br>
One suitable embodiment of the substance mixture of the invention is present if the mixture additionally contains homeopathic substances. These homeopathic sub¬stances may either increase the healing effect of the inventive substance mixture by their particular proper ties, or they may cause additional effects, depending on the homeopathic substance admixed.<br>
A particularly advantageous use of the substance mixture of the invention consists in preparing a remedy<br><br>
for treating hemorrhoidal diseases. As has been men¬tioned, the known effect of honey against hemorrhoids can be increased and enhanced according to the inven¬tion by the presence of olive oil such that hemorrhoi¬dal diseases not only are alleviated but can effectively be removed (cf. Example 1). In contrast to the medicaments described in the prior art, the sub¬stance mixture according to the invention acts rapidly and reliably removes hemorrhoids, as is also demon¬strated in the Examples. A substance mixture independ¬ently comprising 30-80%, in particular 50-60% of honey, 1-20%, in particular 7-10% of olive oil, and 1-30%, in particular 15-20% of beeswax, is preferably used.<br>
A further advantageous use of the substance mix¬ture according to the invention consists in preparing an  agent for hair and skin care,   preferably against the loss of hair, dandruff formation and dehydration. These properties, too, (anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, and antimycotic effects; stopping of itching, burning, skin' irritations, and of eczema formation and thus the stop¬ping of the main causes of dandruff formation; improv¬ing circulation and activation of the function of the diseased root; supply with vitamins, trace elements, natural glucose, amines,- enbalming of scalp and hair, whereby a dehydration is prevented) have been demon¬strated in several tests (cf. Example 2). These effects have not even been described for the individual compo-<br><br>
nents of the substance mixture in the prior art. Pref¬erably, a substance mixture independently comprising 10-40%, in particular 20-30%, of honey, 1-10%, in par¬ticular 4-6%, of olive oil, and 1-40%, in particular 15-25%, of Aloe vera.<br>
Another advantageous use of the substance mixture according to the invention consists in the preparation of an agent for skin care (cf. Example 3). This agent is particularly effective in the treatment of wrinkles formed, acne, impure skin, sun burn, wounds, environ¬mental damage as well as (purulent) inflammations of the skin of the most varying causes. The substance mix¬ture of the invention not only is applied if problems already exist, it may also be applied prophylactically to protect against environmental influences. Prefera¬bly, a substance mixture independently comprising 10-40%, in particular 15-25%, of honey, 1-30%, in particu¬lar 10-20%, of olive oil, and 10-50%, in particular 20-40%, of Aloe vera is used.<br>
A further advantageous use of the substance mix¬ture according to the invention consists in the prepa¬ration of an agent against varicose veins. Here, honey and olive oil, if applied topically, act to activate circulation.<br>
The agent to be used according to the invention may be prepared in all the application forms common for topical medicaments, in particular as an ointment,<br><br>
emulsion, sponge, soap, shampoo, facial pack, bath salts, plaster, stocking, lotion,...<br>
According to a further aspect, the present inven¬tion relates to a substance mixture comprising 50-90% of honey, and olive oil. Optimally, the substance mix¬ture comprises approximately 60% of honey. It has been shown that the positive properties of the ointment are best utilized if the honey is a mixture of honey from blossoms, wild honey and acacia (robinia) honey.<br>
Advantageously, the substance mixture according to the invention comprises 5-15% of olive oil. Optimal is an addition of approximately 8.5% of olive oil, since the agent according to the invention then is most ef¬fective against hemorrhoidal ailments.<br>
Furthermore, it is suitable if the substance mix¬ture additionally comprises one, several or all of the following substances: beeswax, propolis, camomile, sage, Aloe vera, thyme and/or lavender.<br>
A particularly advantageous substance mixture is obtained if it comprises 10-30%, preferably 18%, of beeswax, 1-15%, preferably 5%, of propolis, and/or 1-10%, preferably 2%, of camomile, and/or 1-10%, prefera¬bly 2%, of sage, and/or 1-10%, preferably 2%, of Aloe vera, and/or 0.1-10%, preferably 1%, of thyme, and/or 0.01-5%, preferably 0.2%, of lavender.<br>
Furthermore, it is advantageous if the substance mixture comprises additional components, such as fur-<br><br>
ther vegetable substances (such as, e.g., birch oil, Bois Bondee bark, royal jelly, jasmine, St. John's wort oil, marjoram, myrrh, almond oil, peppermint, pollen, rose oil, rosemary, sandalwood, milfoil, wheatgerm oil, cedar wood oil, cinnamon and/or cypress), homeopathic substances or mixtures of these components. Further¬more, the substance mixture of the invention may also comprise substances which assist in its application or storage stability, such as, e.g., stabilizers, pre¬servatives, pharmaceutical adjuvants, buffer sub¬stances, thickening agents, emulsifiers,...<br>
The invention will be further explained by way of the following Examples, to which, of course, it is not restricted.<br>
Example 1:<br>
Treatment of patients afflicted with hemorrhoids:<br>
Composition of ointment:<br>
Honey (55%), wherein 30% of honey from blossoms, 30% of acacia (robinia) honey and 40% of wild honey are contained, olive oil (8.5%), propolis (5% of a 40% tincture), beeswax (18%), camomile tincture, sage tinc¬ture, lavender, thyme, Aloe vera, wheatgerm oil.<br>
36 patients afflicted with hemorrhoids (21 women aged between 23 and 64 years, and 15 men aged between 25 and 66 years) were treated for 4 weeks with the fol¬lowing application prescription, the ointment being ap¬plied 3 times per day during the first week and twice<br><br>
per day in the following weeks: The elongated portion of the tube of the ointment was introduced into the rectum by about 3-5 cm, the ointment was injected ac¬cording to the patient's feeling while the elongated portion of the tube was slowly retracted. The ointment was also applied around the anus, then allowed to dry, and any desired sanitary napkin was used (without wip¬ing off). After approximately 20 min, the sanitary nap¬kin was removed.<br>
Shortly after the application, slight burning was experienced in some cases, yet subsequently the good feeling of the easing of the pain and of the antipru¬ritic effect set in until the discomfort had disap¬peared.<br>
With the plurality of test subjects, the hemor¬rhages stopped on the second day, with the complaints largely gone. In 8 patients, the hemorrhages stopped on the sixth day and a substantial improvement set in; these patients, however, had suffered from hemorrhoids already for between 2 and 11 years.<br>
16 of the test persons were additionally afflicted with perianal thromboses; also for this disease an ex¬tensive regression was experienced under treatment. For 3 patients, surgery had been planned because of their hemorrhoidal disease, the indication of which had been diagnosed by a specialist. After the treatment this in¬dication was no longer present (also determined by the<br><br>
specialist).<br>
Example 2 .-<br>
Treatment of patients suffering from loss of hair<br>
Composition of hair pack: honey (25%), wherein 40% acacia (robinia) honey, 30% wild honey and 30% honey from blossoms are contained, olive oil (4.9%), propolis (3% of a 40% tincture), Aloe vera (20%), camomile tinc¬ture, lavender oil, marjoram oil, milfoil tincture, ceder oil, sandalwood tincture, birch oil, myrrh tinc¬ture, rosemary oil, pure royal jelly, pure pollen, rose oil as well as biobase mass and alcohol.<br>
The preparation was tested as follows, 2-3 times per week, for about 3 months, on 7 test persons who suffered from loss of hair: After having washed the hair with a mild shampoo, the hair pack was applied to the towel-dried hair and to the scalp. After a reaction time of 20-30 min, the pack was thoroughly rinsed out with luke-warm water, and subsequently the hair was gently dried.<br>
With 5 persons, the loss of hair stopped. One test subject (duration of illness: 3 months) showed renewed hair growth in areas with already sparse hair growth. With the test person with the longest duration of ill¬ness (15 months), the preparation had no effect.<br>
Example 3:<br>
Preparation of a skin-care facial pack<br>
The following components are mixed to a facial<br><br>
pack according to the invention: honey (20%), olive oil (15%), propolis (8%), Aloe vera (30%), sage tincture, myrrh tincture, camomile tincture, basic substance for a biological creme.<br>
This facial pack can be applied as a creme and be used like a conventional facial pack. The preparation according to the invention is applicable both by day and by night, after a preceding gentle cleaning of the skin.<br><br>
I Claim:<br>
1.	A process for preparing a novel medicament mixture characterized by the step of mixing 50-90% of honey, 5-20% of olive oil and optionally one or more of: beeswax, propolis, camomile, sage, Aloe vera, thyme, lavender and/or various oils as herein described.<br>
