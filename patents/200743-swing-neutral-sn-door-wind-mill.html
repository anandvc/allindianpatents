				<td>This invention relates to a swinging door Wind Energy Conversion device by which availability of energy is optimized even in low wind speed. The principle adopted in the system can be used in wind turbines or water-current-turbines and here directed particularly for use in wind-turbines which are operating at vertical axis.<br>
Wind mills are known in the art to operate the wind turbines. In horizontal axis wind-mills the forceful input of wind force transforms into a force pushing the tower backward and another to drive the load mounted turbine, similar to an aircraft propeller whose input force of rotation transforms into a force pulling the aircraft forward and another forceful backward wind proportionately to the slantness of their blades. Energy spent for pushing the tower backward in wind-mill and energy transformed as backward wind in the propeller are wasted in terms of their utility. In addition to this unavoidable fundamentals inherent in such wind-mills, the disparity of traveling distance of blades close to its axis and at the ends for completing the circle also leads to energy loss which dissolves in blades itself. Although a little improvement can be done for this by adopting automatic and/or variable fin system and/or pitch control system etc. for blades, the principle of proportionate division of force based on the angularity of blades cannot be averted. No exact measurement of energy loss can be calculated on various accounts, but it can be roughly estimated at not less than half the wind force tracked. Even in the most sophisticated wind-mill machines these are some of the reasons for the requirement of high velocity wind speed range of around 20 kmph for a normal working condition which is not generally available. Highly stubborn and costly tower structures are another requirement to withstand any unexpected violent wind force.<br><br>
In case of a conventional vertical axis wind-mill like the one in Fig 1 a large portion of the wind force that accumulates at the concavely faced wings, say Y-side wings, is obstructed by the force attracting at convexly faced wings, say X-side wings, since the wind blows at both sides equally. Moreover, the wings at X-side which travel against the wind at a double traveling distance of Y-side wings in the force lines of the wind is also augmenting the obstruction further. What we can gain here is only a portion of air concentration force at Y-side and the entire remaining force just goes to the pillar. But the advantage here we have is that by adopting rope supported pillar the cost of tower structure can be minimized. Although wind guiding mechanism can be brought into use in this, striking wind force will get reduced till it reaches up to the wing. By doing so more strong and costly pillar structure with guiding system is also essential which will increase the cost. It is clear from the above that, if we neutralize or get rid of the force attracting at X-side the extra gain in this account at Y-side will be exactly an equal amount of force which was attracting at X-side. This is being done through this invention.<br>
Accordingly, the main object of this invention is to provide a wind energy conversion device which can operate and increase output at the lowest possible wind velocity.<br>
Another object of this invention is to reduce the cost of erecting the device by adopting a ground based energy conversion system and a pillar structure instead of a tower.<br>
Yet another object of this invention is to enhance the strength of pillar structure to withstand any eventuality of violent and cyclonic winds by adopting angular rope supports.<br><br>
Still another object of this invention is to provide a Centrifugally Controlled Automatic Speed Regulating and Safety Mechanism which regulate speed of the turbine in high and low velocity winds and provides safety of the system during violent winds automatically.<br>
According to this invention there is provided a swinging door wind energy conversion device comprising a vertical axis supported rotatably in a reinforced pillar, a plurality of wings being secured alternatively with the lower and upper hub places provided near the top end of said axis, a transmission drive gear secured at the bottom end of said axis or/and being extended downwardly, for rotating the means connected therewith, characterized in that a plurality of swinging door means being provided with said wings such that to optimize the conversion of the wind energy, centrifugally controlled automatic speed regulating means are provided with said doors for regulating of the speed the wind energy conversion device and for saving the device during violent wind automatically.<br>
In accordance with this invention a swinging door wind energy conversion device comprises a vertical axis having a plurality of wings secured therewith alternatively in the horizontal place and by means of connection beams/rods. The connection beams are secured to the lower and upper hub places secured with the vertical axis. The axis is supported in a pillar which is kept vertical by means of supporting ropes. The axis is extended downwardly. The driving gear is secured at the lower end of the axis such that to be engaged with the means which are to be driven by the swinging door wind energy conversion device. Specifically, according to this invention swinging doors are provided with the horizontal sides of the wings so as to optimize the conversion of the energy even<br><br>
if the speed of the wind is low. Centrifugally Controlled automatic speed regulating and safety mechanism is provided with the swinging doors so as to save the system when the speed of the wind is very high.<br>
The wind energy conversion system according to a preferred embodiment of this invention is herein described and illustrated in the accompanying drawings, wherein: -<br>
Fig 1    Shows Conventional vertical Axis wind turbine having 6 horizontally<br>
operating wings arranged at lower and upper circles alternatively, Fig 2   Shows a wing with a number of doors, Fig 3   Shows the back view of the vertical frame and door fittings. Fig 4   Shows a front view of the vertical frame and door fittings, Fig 5   Shows impact of wind on doors at different directions, and Fig 6   Shows Centrifugally Controlled Automatic Speed Regulating and Safety<br>
Mechanism. Referring to the drawings particularly Fig 1 the swinging door wind turbine has a vertically disposed axis 1 on which a plurality of wings 2 are alternatively jointed at lower and upper hub plates 3 by means of beam 5 and are operating horizontally at lower and upper circles LC and UC. The vertical axis 1 is erected in a reinforced pillar 6 on bearings 7 and supported by rope supports 8 for its stubborn, elevated vertical holding. The extension rod 4 of axis 1 passes through the concrete slab 9 downwardly and extends up to the transmission drive 10 to which the energy conversion system can be connected. During the operation of the device half of the horizontal wings remains on X-side and the other half of the wings remains on Y-side. X and Y sides are 180 degrees on either sides<br><br>
of the force lines of the wind reaching straight to the axis 1. These features are as such known in the art and do not constitute inventive feature of this invention.<br>
Specifically according to the present invention and as shown in Fig 2 the wings 2 comprises a structure having two straight C &amp; D joined together at an obtuse angle Z. A plurality of rows having plurality of doors 12 are arranged in the structure upon one another so as to accumulate and concentrate the wind force in the depth formed by angling the structural sides C &amp; D. Shutters 20 and 21 are provided at the top and bottom sides of the structural sides C &amp; D to create a parallel forcelines of wind for efficient performance of doors 12. The pivotal joints 13 of door 12 and frame joints 22 provided such that when structures C &amp; D are joined together the joints 13 and 22 should not align with each other. This mismatch of alignments is provided to avoid a possible entanglement of adjacent doors 12 located at the angle while in operation. The doors 12 at top and bottom columns in structure C are comparatively smaller than other doors 12. This is done to keep both sides of the wing equal and that no angular shape should form to the shutters 20 and 21 during horizontal operation of wing 2. It can be seen that the structural sides explained here can be even one or many, but the results will only have a slight variation.<br>
Reference now made to the Fig 3 is a vertical frame 11 has an equally fitting door 12 which is pivotal on the vertical sides of the frame 11 so that the area of the door 12 is divided in the ratio of about 3 : 4 as P and Q segments. The larger segment being Q, it is hanging towards the lower side. The weight difference of these P and Q segments is kept marginal so that lowest possible impact of the door be on the frame 11 while its closing and opening to minimize the energy loss.  The pivot joint 13 on either side of frame 11<br><br>
through which the pivot bar 15 passing has to be fixed in a bearing to the door 12 or to the frame 11 to enable its free swinging. The reinforcement 14 fixes the pivot bar 15 to the door 12. The frame 11 and door 12 are light weight and strong enough to withstand any forceful blow of wind. A light lining or sponge or cloth (not shown) is provided along the inner side of the frame 11 to make it air tight when the door 12 is closed. Referring to Fig 4 a lower door interconnecting bracket 16 and upper door interconnecting bracket 19 are fitted on either ends of the top and bottom sides of the door 12 and having exact curves to make the door 12 tightly fitted on the frame 11. The tension stays 18 provided at the bottom side of the frame 11 act as an additional support and reinforcement of the door 12. A reinforcement 17 is provided at front side of the door 12 so that it may not bend with the blow of wind. It can be seen that the segmentation of doors anywhere else at upper half of its horizontal or the vertical sides by the pivotal joints 13 will only have a slight difference in its performance.<br>
Reference now made to Fig 5 is a centrifugally controlled automatic speed regulating and safety mechanism provided with the door 12 to regulate speed of turbine and safeguard it during violent winds automatically. The regulating and safety mechanism comprises a door protection bar 31 secured at the vertical side of the structure of the door. A fly weight bar 30 is an angular projection of the door protection bar 31 and on which the flyweight 23 is hanging on its hinge 29 by means of suspension bar 25. A flyweight retention spring 32 is provided between the bars 31 and 25 to retain the flyweight 23 from swinging sideways which will not relent during ordinary rotation of wing 2. A door hook lever 33 and lever pulling wire 24 which is connection to flyweight suspension bar 25 are interconnection by a ring hook 34 on the lever pulling wire 24. A<br><br>
cone shaped door hook 26 having an angular base portion at the top, fitted with door hook lever 33 which aligns with the position of door interlocking bracket 16, locks the door 12 upwards and restricts its downward movement when the door 12 is fully open if the flyweight 23 is activated by centrifugal force. The retention spring 27 for door hook lever 33 is provided to bring back the door hook 26 in a sliding disengagement to its original position. The backside door interconnecting brackets 19 similar to door brackets 16 is provided for ensuring all other doors 12 in the column to move in unison. When there is excessive wind speed due to excess rotation of wing 2 than a predetermined speed, sideward centrifugal force will force the flyweight 23 to swing outward and the lever pulling wire 24 which is connection with flyweight suspension bar 25 pulls the door hook lever 33 as shown by the dotted lines and causes the locking of door 12 upwards to open position. So the wind pass through it without inflicting its force on the wing 2. When speed reduced, automatically centrifugal force will come down and flyweight 23 comes back to its original position and lever pulling wire 24 releases the door hook lever 33 which disengages door hook 26 and allow the door 12 to come down and start functioning as normal. The size of flyweight 23 (a), 23 (b) and 23 (c) as shown in the Fig 2 &amp; 5 are different to facilitate the stage by stage locking up of columns of doors 12 when necessary and stage by stage release of doors 12 so that the speed of rotation is kept regulated at all times. This can also be done by giving different grades of tension to the flyweight retention spring 32. Speed adjustment of the turbine can also be done by changing the weight of the flyweight 23 or the tension of the retention spring 32 as required, if necessary.<br><br>
In Fig 6 the horizontal movement of a door with door having outer sides top P and bottom Q on a vertical frame having outer sides top A and bottom B at eight different directions 1 to 8 are shown, when the wind is blowing from direction as indicated by arrows marked W. In the direction No 1 it can be noticed that sides A and B of the frame and sides P and Q of the door are almost in the direct of force lines of wind and do not attract the force of wind on the frame. Till it reach up to direction No 2 the lower portion of the door Q swing to the bottom of the frame B and get blocked in it with the force of wind itself because the larger segment Q of the door is at the lower side, inflicting the force of wind on the frame. This status of the door and frame continues till the frame reach up to direction No 4. On completion of the semi-circle upto the Direction No 5 wind force lines reaching the door got changed because the sides of frame A and B and sides of the door P and Q are now at the other side, but the larger segment of the door Q is always at lower side. Now the force lines of wind start blowing on the opposite side of door and as frame moves upto direction No 6 the larger segment Q of the door being at lower side, by the force of wind itself, door swings open and the wind passes away without making its impact on the frame. This status continues till the frame reach up to direction No 8. From there the frames moves on to the direction No 1 and repeats the process of closing the door at Y side and opening the door at X-side of the axis automatically.<br>
The effects of centrifugal force will not be so active on the door since the weight factor on either side of the door is only marginal and also the rotation is loaded with resistance of some application, thereby making the centrifugal force inferior to the wind force. However, for a safety and functional efficiency a protective block 28 as shown in<br><br>
Fig 5 from inner side of the wing is essential which will not allow the door to turn upside down. Irrespective of the direction of wind the doors of wings reaching one side of the axis of turbine is engaged while the other side of the axis of turbine is disengaged automatically and needs no employment of any wind direction device. Since the obstruction force in the rotation of a conventional vertical axis wind turbine from one side being neutralized the wings at the other side come in a lever-like engagement on its axis leaving very little force of wind to be transferred to the pillar, the option for increasing length of beams of wings for getting added mechanical advantage is not a limitation.<br>
Accordingly to an embodiment of this invention the principle explained herein above is not limited to a vertical frame and door as shown in Fig 3 and 4. A rhombus shaped door having opposite comers at horizontal sides or any other suitable shape and frames structured accordingly for the free movement of door can also have a similar effect. The basic wing structure can be a plurality of frames with a composite support system with one or many structural sides in a manner to suit the free swinging of doors with its stop devices and the horizontal axis bar for the door.<br><br><br>
