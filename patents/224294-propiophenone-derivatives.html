The present invention relates to propiophenone derivatives laving a hypoglycemic activity  and a process for preparing the same.<br>
Although diet therapy is essential in the treatment of diabetes, when diet therapy does not sufficiently control the conditions of patients, insulin or an oral intidiabetic is additionally used. There have been used as an antidiabetic gamed compounds and sulfonylurea compounds. However, these mtidiabetics have various side effects. For example, iguanid compounds :pause lactic acidosis, and sulfonylurea compounds cause significant hypoglycemia. Under such circumstances, it has been desired to develop novel drugs for treatment of diabetes having no such side effects.<br>
Recently, it has been reported that hyperglycemia participates in the outbreak and progressive Impairment of diabetes, i.e., glucose toxicity theory. That is, chronic hyperglycemia leads to decrease unsound secretion and contributes to increase insulin resistance, and as a result, the blood glucose concentration is increased so that diabetes is  exacerbated [cf. Diabetologia, Vol. 28. p. 119 (1985); Diabetes Care, Vol. 13, p. 610 (1990), etc.]. Therefore, by treating hyperglycemia, the aforementioned self-exacerbating cycle is interrupted so that the prophylaxis or treatment of diabetes is made possible.<br>
As one of the methods for treating hyperglycemia, it is considered to excrete an excess amount of glucose directly into urine so that the blood<br><br>
glucose concentration is normalized.<br>
Phlorizin is a glycoside which exists in barks and stems of Rosaceae (e.g., apple, pear, etc.). Recently, it has been found that phlorizin is an inhibitor of Na^-glucose co-transporter which exists only in chorionic membrane of the intestine and the kidney, and by inhibiting Na+-glucose co-transporter, phlorizin inhibits the renal tubular glucose reassertion and promotes the excretion of glucose so that the glucose level in a plasma is controlled. Based on this action of phlorizin, when the glucose level in a plasma in diabetic animals is controlled at a normal level for a long time by subcutaneous dally administration of phlorizin, the conditions of diabetic animals are ameliorated to be normal [cf. Journal of Clinical Investigation, Vol. 79, p. 1510 (1987), ibid. Vol. 80, p. 1037 (1987), ibid. Vol. 87, p. 561 (1991), etc.].<br>
However, when phlorizin is administered orally, most of it is hydrolyzed to afford glucose and phloretin, which is the aglycon of phlorizin, and hence, the amount of phlorizin to be absorbed is so little that the urine glucose excretion effect of phlorizin is very weak. Besides, phloretin, which is the aglycon of phlorizin, has been known to strongly inhibit a facilitated diffusion-type glucose transporter. For example, when phloretin is intravenously administered to rats, the glucose concentration in brain of rats is decreased [cf. Stroke, Vol. 14, p. 388 (1983)]. Therefore, when phlorizin is administered for a long time, there may be adverse effects on various tissues, and hence, phlorizin has not been used as an antidiabetic. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a 4'-lower   derivative which shows an urine glucose increasing activity because it<br><br>
inhibits the renal tubular glucose reabsorption, and shows an excellent hypoglycemic activity, and at the same time, whose aglycon has a very weak inhibitory activity of facilitated diffusion-type glucose transporter. Another object of the present invention is to provide a process for preparing a propiophenone derivative of the present invention. A further object of the present invention is to provide a hypoglycemic agent comprising as an active ingredient a propiophenone derivative of the present invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.

The reaction may be carried out from a temperature under cooling to a temperature with heating, preferably at a temperature from -10°C to IOO°C, especially at a temperature of from O'C to SOX.<br>
In the above process (1), the compound of the formula (1-b) wherein Ri is a lower alkoxycarbonyl group can be prepared by a modified method disclosed in J. Chem. Soc.

The compound (I-f) is prepared by protecting the 3-hydroxy group of the p-D-glucopyranosyl group of the compound (I-d). The protection of the hydroxy groups of the p-D-glucopyranosyl group is carried out by a method disclosed in the process (5) described hereinbelow, or by the methods disclosed in Examples, or a conventional method.<br>

(3)	l,3-Dimethoxy-5-ethylbenzene (7.69 g) is dissolved in acetic acid (80 ml), and thereto is added with stirring 47 % hydrobromic acid at room temperature. The mixture is refluxed for three hours, and the reaction mixture is cooled to room temperature. The mixture is concentrated to dryness under reduced pressure, and the residue is dissolved in ethyl acetate. The organic layer is washed successively with water and a saturated aqueous sodium chloride solution, dried, and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue is recrystallized from diisopropyl ether-hexane to give l,3-dihydroxy-5-ethyl-benzene (5.94 g), m.p. 97-98°C.<br>
(4)	l,3-Dihydroxy-5-ethylbenzene (5.92 g) is dissolved in pyridine (32 ml), and thereto is added with stirring acetic anhydride (17.5 g) at room temperature. One hour thereafter, the reaction mixture is poured into chilled 10 % hydrochloric acid, and the mixture is extracted witii ethyl acetate. The organic layer is washed successively with water, a saturated aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate solution, and a saturated aqueous sodium chloride solution, dried, and concentrated under reduced pressure to give l,3-diacetoxy-5-ethyl-<br><br>
benzene (9.60 g). The physicochemical properties are the same as those of the compound obtained in Reference Example 4-(5). EFFECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
The compounds (I) of the present invention and a pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof show an excellent hypoglycemic activity because of the increasing effect of the urine glucose excretion, based on the inhibition activity of renal tubular glucose reabsorption. For example, when administered orally to rats, the present compounds increase the amount of urine glucose more than 50 times as much as phlorizin does.<br>
In addition, the compounds (I) of the present invention show low toxicity. Besides, the aglycone of the compounds (I), the hydrolysate thereof.<br>
show extremely a weak inhibitory activity against facilitated diffosion-type glucose transporter.<br>
Therefore, the compounds (I) of the present invention can treat hyper¬glycemia, by which the self-exacerbating cycle of glucose toxicity is interrupted, so that the compounds (I) are useful in the prophylaxis or treatment of diabetes [e.g., diabetes mellitus such as insulin-dependent diabetes(type I diabetes), insulin-independent diabetes (type II diabetes)], or in the rectification of hyperglycemia after meal.<br><br><br>
WE CLAIM:<br>

3.	The compound as claimed in claim 2, wherein Z is a P-D-glucopyranosyl group, or a P-D-glucopyranosy] group wherein one or more hydroxy groups are acylated by a group selected from the group consisting of a   alkanoyl group, a   alkoxycarbonyl group, a   alkoxy-  alkanoyl group and a  alkoxy  alkoxycarbonyl group, or a p-D-glucopyranosyt group wherein two hydroxy groups combine form a l-  alkoxy  alkylidenedioxy group or a phosphinicodioxy group together with the protecting groups thereof<br><br><br><br><br>
9.	The compound as claimed in claim 1, which is 3-{5-benzo[b]furanyl)-2'-(P-D-<br>
gIucopyranosyloxy)-6'-hydroxy-4'-methylpropiophenone.<br>
10.	The compound as claimed in claim 1, which is 3-(5-benzo[b]litany)-2'-(6-0-<br>
