FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to stranded cables, and more particularly, to stranded twisted pair patch cables for high-speed LAN applications.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Local area networks (LAN's) now connect a vast number of personal computers, workstations, printers, and file servers in the modem office. A LAN system is typically implemented by physically connecting all of these devices with copper-conductor twisted-wire pair ("twisted-pair") LAN cables, the most common being an unshielded twisted-pair type ("UTP") LAN cable. A conventional UTP LAN cable includes four twisted pairs, i.e. 8-wires. Each of the four twisted-pairs function as a transmission line to convey a data signal tlirough the LAN cable. Each end of the LAN cable usually terminates in a modular-type connector with pin assignments of type "RJ-45", according to the international standard lEC 603-7. Modular RJ-45 connectors may be in the form of either plugs or jacks, and a mated plug and jack is considered a cormection.<br>
In a typical installation, UTP LAN cables are routed through walls, floors, and<br><br>
ceilings of a building. LAN cable systems require constant care, including maintenance, upgrading and troubleshooting. In particular, LAN cables and connectors are subject to breakage or unintentional disconnection. Moreover, because offices and equipment must be moved, or because new equipment may be added to an existing LAN, the UTP cable is often manipulated and adjusted. In order to minimize disruption of a LAN system, two types of wiring are used. The first type of wiring is relatively stiff, and is installed in a substantially permanent or fixed configuration. The stiff wiring is used for horizontal cormections through walls, or between floors and work areas. For the second type of wiring, a relatively short length of LAN cable, called a patch cord, is used. The patch cord includes a connector mounted on each end, and is used to interconnect between the fixed wiring of a building and the movable equipment at each end of the LAN cable system. Patch cords are typically manufactured and sold in predetermined lengths, for example two meters, with the modular RJ-45 plugs installed on either of the flexible cable.<br>
Patch cords are an essential element of a LAN system, typically connecting moveable LAN-based equipment to a fixed module. Thus, when equipment is installed, patch cords are used to provide the final interconnection between the equipment and the rest of the LAN. To facilitate easy interconnection between the fixed wiring associated with a fixed module and the movable LAN-based equipment, the patch cord is relatively flexible. Specifically, the individual wires of a patch cord are typically formed from stranded metal conductor wires, which are more flexible than solid core wires.<br>
Patch cords significantly impact the overall transmission quality of the LAN. Even though the cable and plugs that make up the patch cord are themselves compliant with appropriate standards, the assembled patch cord, when used as part of a user charmel, may cause the user channel configuration to be out of compliance with accepted standards. Moreover, patch cords are often subject to physical abuse in user work areas as the patch cord<br><br>
is moved or manipulated by either the installer or the system user. As the patch cord is moved or manipulated, the strands within a wire may separate slightly, affecting the electrical properties of the wire. In particular, separation of the strands may result in greater attenuation of a data signal and impedance variations along the length of the patch cord.<br>
To limit separation of individual strands within a wire during use, it is knowTi to apply a tin solution to the surface of stranded copper wires to seal or bond the individual strands to adjoining strands of copper. However, tin is a poor conductor, and may adversely affect the electrical properties of the wire, and construction of tinned copper conductors requires an extra and difficult manufacturing step.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed to a method of forming flexible communications wire for use in Local Area Networks (LAN's). The inventive method comprises forming a metal conductor from a plurality of individual metal strands, and subjecting the metal conductor to both compression and heat to slightly adhere the strands together.<br>
Wires formed according to the present invention are sturdier than conventional stranded conductor wires, while retaining significant flexibility. In fact, a wire formed from according to the inventive method retains more flexibility than a wire having tin bonds between individual strands. In addition, because the strands are compressed, the wire outer diameter is reduced, which also reduces attenuation effects along the length of the wire. Significantly, the compression and heating steps may be applied simultaneously, decreasing manufacturing time and complexity.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS A twisted pair LAN patch cable includes at least one pair of insulated conductors twisted about each other to form a two-conductor group. When more than one twisted pair group is bunched or cabled together, as shown.in Figure 1, it is referred to as a multi-pair cable 10. In a typical configuration, multi-pair cable 10 includes four twisted pair conductors 12. Each twisted pair 12 includes a pair of wires 14. Each wire 14 further includes a respective central conductor 16. For both economic and use-base reasons related to flexibility, the central conductor 16 typically is formed from a plurality of metal strands. A corresponding layer 18 of dielectric or insulative material also surrounds each central<br><br>
conductor 16. The diameter D of the central conductor 16, expressed in AWG size, is typically between about 18 to about 40 AWG, while the insulation thickness T is typically expressed in inches (or other suitable units). The insulative or dielectric material may be any commercially available dielectric material, such as polyvinyl chloride, polyethylene, polypropolylene or fluoro-copolymers (like Teflon®) and polyolefm. The insulation may be fire resistant as necessary. The twisted pairs 12 are further surrounded by a protective, but flexible cable jacket 19 with typical physical characteristics well known to those skilled in the art.<br>
Most typically, LAN wiring consists of 4 individually twisted pairs, though the wiring may include more or less pairs as required. For example, some LAN wiring is often constructed with 9 or 25 twisted pairs. The twisted pairs may optionally be wrapped in foil shielding (not shown), but twisted pair technology is such that most often the shielding is omitted. As a result, the LAN cable is referred to as 'unshielded twisted pair" wiring, or UTP.<br>
Common prior art configurations of the stranded conductors of individual wires are shown in Figures 2 and 4. In Figure 2, a stranded conductor 14 is formed from seven individual strands 20 of metal. In the most common configuration, a single strand 22 is surrounded by six strands 24, forming a symmetric cross-section. In Figure 4, nineteen individual strands 20 are wound to form a stranded conductor 26. In the configuration shov^n in Figure 4, a single strand 22 is surrounded by six strands 24, which are then surrounded by twelve strands 28. Thus, in both Figure 2 and Figure 4, a first layer, comprised of a single strand, is surrounded by a second layer, comprised of six individual strands. In Figure 4, a third layer, comprised of twelve individual strands, surrounds the first two layers.<br>
The seven- and nineteen-strand conductors represent the most efficient geometry of a stranded conductor.   However, even in these configurations, formation of a wire out of<br><br>
multiple individual strands leaves interstitial spaces 30 between adjacent strands 20 and their defined layers as well as circumferential gaps 32 along the outer surface of the central conductor 16. Because the outer surfaces 34 of individual strands 20 interact with adjacent strands, the minimum outer diameter D is limited. Moreover, as may be appreciated, when a multiple-strand central conductor 16 is flexed or moved, the interstitial spaces 30 and circumferential gaps 32 also flex and move, and the flexing causes undesirable dynamic physical interaction between strands 20 (e.g., rubbing), thereby adversely affecting the electrical properties of the wire. As the electrical properties change within the wire, signal may be lost during transmission. Also, extensive flexing may result in permanent physical degradation to the wire and the accompanying adverse affect to its electrical properties.<br>
Signal loss is called "attenuation", which defines the amount of signal lost as a signal travels down a wire. Attenuation is measured in decibels (dB). As stranded wire flexes, attenuation increases due to dissimilar movement of the individual strands. Additionally, "impedance" represents the best "path" for signal transmission. Impedance is affected by spacing between adjacent conductor strands. Therefore, if a cable flexes and individual conductor strands become spaced apart, impedance may increase, both in a specific location and as averaged along the length of the conductor. In particular, if a signal traversing a wire encounters a local increase in impedance, part of the signal may be reflected rather than transmitted due to an impedance mismatch. As applied to stranded central conductors, if the strands selectively separate and contact, or if the interstitial spaces and circumferential gaps selectively move and change both shape and their relative, then both local impedance and the average impedance along the entire wire are dynamically and undesirably modified.<br>
Finally, at least along the outer circumference of central conductors 14 and 26 (Figures 2 and 4), a portion of the dielectric layer 18 (Figure 1) may flow into and fill the<br><br>
gaps 32 when it is applied.   As a result, stripping of the dielectric layer from the central conductor may be difficult.<br>
It is known to apply a thin layer of tin to the outer circumference of each individual strand 20 so that the tin layers on adjacent stranded conductors overlap to form a tin seal between adjacent strands. In this way, lateral movement of the strands relative to each other is minimized. However, tin imparts undesirable electrical and physical characteristics to the conductor. Significantly, applying a tin layer to each stand 20 does not eliminate the interstitial spaces or circumferential gaps between individual strands, and in fact, may increase the size of each space or gap, depending upon the tin layer thickness.<br>
According to the present invention, rather than applying a tin layer to each strand, the central conductors are formed from multiple strands of conductive metal, and are then compressed and heated to bond the individual strands together. As seen in Figure 3, a central conductor 40 is shown after application of the inventive method to a prior art seven-stranded central conductor (such as shown in FIG. 2). A single strand 42 forms a first layer, and six additional strands 44 form a second layer. The first layer 42 retains an essentially circular cross-sectional shape after compression, but the heating step allows the first layer to be bonded along its outer circumference 46 to the second layer.<br>
The six wires of the second layer form an essentially symmetrical pattern around the first layer. In particular, each strand 44 is deformed under compression into a generally trapezoidal shape. A first arcuate side 48 forrns a portion of the interface between the first and second layers along first layer outer circumference 46, while a second arcuate side 50 forms a portion of the outer circumferential surface 52 of the central conductor 40. Two radially extending sides 54, 56 interconnect the first arcuate side 48 and the second arcuate side 50 of adjacent strands 44. As can clearly be seen in Figure 3, interstitial space and circumferential gaps are essentially eliminated between the strands.   As a result, the outer<br><br>
diameter D' of central conductor 40 in Figure 3 is less than the minimum outer diameter D of uncompressed conductor 14 of Figure 2. Additionally, when heat is applied, a thin layer of metal on the outer circumference of each strand melts and blends with a similar layer on adjacent strands, forming bonds along the first arcuate side 48 and along the radially extending sides 54, 56. Moreover, because the circumferential gaps are eliminated, the outer surface, formed from second arcuate sides 50, is smooth, enabling a user to easily strip the insulation from the conductor.<br>
The compression applied to the individual strands is preferably sufficient to compress the stranded wire so that new diameter D' is between fifty and ninety percent (50-90%) of the original minimum diameter D. Compression and heat may be applied as the individual strands are brought together in a single manufacturing step, thereby reducing manufacturing time and complexity, especially over methods that first apply a tin layer to the outer surface of individual strands. It should also be noted that for those applications that do not require compression or a reduced diameter central conductor, heat alone may be applied to the strands to form a bond between adjacent strands, as shown in Figure 6. Bonds 60 are formed between adjacent strands 20, caused by melting and blending of a small layer along the outer circumference of adjacent strands. The combination of heat and compression may therefore be varied to achieve the desired bonding between strands and a given reduced diameter D'.<br>
For applications requiring a slightly larger central conductor, any number of additional strands 20 may be added to reach the desired diameter D'. For example, in Figure 5, the nineteen individual strands of the prior art central conductor shown in Figure 4 have been compressed and heated to form a three-layer central conductor. As discussed above with reference to Figure 3, the central conductor 70 retains a generally circular cross-sectional shape, while the strands of both the first layer 72 and the second layer 74 are deformed under compression into generally symmetrical trapezoidal shapes that provide a<br><br>
generally smooth interface between each layer. Then, when heated, bonds are formed between adjacent surfaces as discussed above, due to melting and blending of a small layer of each strand along adjacent outer surfaces.<br>
Preferably, the compression and heat applied to a central conductor 14 is sufficient such that when an insulated wire including central conductor 14 is bent around a four inch (4") mandrel of between two to ten times (2-1 Ox) the insulated conductor diameter (i.e., D'+2T), the strands forming central conductor 14 remain within zero to ten percent (0-10%) of their original strand to strand orientation. In a preferred configuration, each wire is specifically designed to allow attenuation at 100 MHz of no more than 20 decibels per 100 meters with a maximum insulated conductor diameter (D'+2T) of 0.0395 inches.<br>
To form a twisted conductor pair 12 (Figure 1), two insulated central conductors manufactured as described above are twisted with a predetermined twist lay length. In a preferred twisted conductor pair configuration, the capacitance difference between the two insulated conductors comprising the twisted pair, measured separately, does not vary more than 0.1 pico farads (0.1 pF) per 100 meters. Moreover, the conductor to conductor outer diameter deviation should be in the range of+/- 0.005 inches, and the capacitance at 1 KHz variation between insulated single conducts of a pair should not vary more than .1 pico farads (pF) per 100 meters. Finally, mutual capacitance at 1 KHz between twisted pair elements should vary no more than 0.5 pF per 100 meters within a multi-pair cable.<br>
A cable 10 formed according to the present invention will then have an impedance that will not vary more than +/- 2 ohms, compared to an initial reading before the test, for an average impedance that is in a range of about 1 MHz to 100 MHz, even after being flexed around a mandrel having a diameter between approximately two to ten (2-10) times the outer cable diameter. Most preferably, cable 10 may be flexed around the same mandrel repeatedly and still have an impedance variance no greater than +/- 3 ohms, compared to an initial<br><br>
reading before the test, for the same range of average impedances. In a most preferred embodiment, cable 10 may be subjected to flexing up to twenty (20) times around the same mandrel and still maintain an impedance variance no greater than +/- 3 ohms.<br>
A final embodiment of the present invention is shown in Figure 7 that avoids the use of tin to hold individual strands in place. Instead, at least one layer of flexible dielectric coating 80 is bonded to the strands to tightly hold each strand in place. In a preferred embodiment, shown in Figure 7, a bare copper or coated copper conductor 82 includes seven individual strands 20. Though the conductor is shown in Figure 7 without the individual strands 20 bonded and compressed together, it should be understood that the following description is applicable to a compressed and bonded conductor such as that shown in Figure 3. The conductor 82, made of seven strands 20, is first coated with an inner layer 84 and an outer layer 86 of insulating dielectric material. Inner coating 84 is preferably a material that, when in a molten form during extrusion, exhibits a relatively low viscosity to flow more readily and fill the interstitial spaces 30 and gaps 32 of the bonded strands to form a tight, high-strength bond to the strands 20 and about the conductor 82. As a result, removal of inner layer 84 requires a relatively high strip force. After application, inner layer 84 acts to hold the strands 20 tightly together to prevent separation of the strands due to flexing of the wire during normal usage of the finished cable. Most preferably, inner dielectric layer 84 is extruded to an approximate thickness of 0.003" maximum wall thickness, which is thick enough to bond the strands together while allowing sufficient flexibility of the wire during use.<br>
After application of inner layer 84, the second, outer layer 86 is then applied in such a way that forms a physical bond to inner layer 84 after extrusion. Outer layer 86 is applied to a predetermined thickness so that the wire when paired, jacketed and optionally shielded exhibits a desired average impedance, typically 100 Ohms. Additionally, outer layer 86 is<br><br>
formed from a material of a desired hardness that prevent deformation during twirming with a wire of like make when up to 1500 grams of tension is applied to each wire (such as when forming twisted pairs). In particular, the two layers 84, 86 are chosen to exhibit an effective dielectric constant about the conductor of 2.6 or less.<br>
Preferably, the inner layer is formed from a linear low density polyolefm material or a medium density polyolefm material. The outer layer may be formed of a high density polyolefm, including Fluorinated Ethylenepropylene (FEP), Ethylene Chlorotrifluoroethylene (ECTFE) or tetrafluoroethylene (TFE)/perfluoromethylvinylether (MFA). Additionally, either or both of the first and second layers may be mixed with a flame retardant package such that the dual insulated layer exhibits a limited oxygen index (LOI) of 28% or greater.<br>
Though the wires formed using the present invention use multiple individual strands to form the central conductor, the strands are bonded together sufficiently to prevent separation or gaps between individual strands. As a result, the electrical properties of the stranded conductors are stabilized to mimic those of a rigid conductor while still permitting the necessary ability for the wire to flex or move to provide interconnection between the fixed module and the LAN-based component. Yet, because no tin is used to bond the strands together, the wire formed according to the present invention is actually more flexible than a tinned conductor, and the bonds between strands are less likely to break despite significant wire manipulation, as the wire is used. Moreover, the minimum outer diameter of the wire formed according to the inventive method is also reduced. Despite the smaller diameter, however, each wire suffers less attenuation of a data signal transmitted thereby when compared to the prior art. Moreover, if desired, more strands of a wire may be used within a defined space to further improve wire performance over pre-existing wires. Alternatively, more wires may be ft within a pre-existing sized jacket. In the case of special environmental<br><br>
conditions (e.g., fireproof layers), the insulation layer may be increased without increasing jacket size.<br>
Preferred embodiments of the present invention have been disclosed. A person of ordinary skill in the art will realize, however, that certain modifications and alternative forms will come within the teachings of this invention. For example, diameters of individual conductors and their insulation layer may be adjusted as necessary.
