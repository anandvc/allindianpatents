				<td>"LINEAR MOTOR"<br>
Technical Field<br>
This invention relates to a compact linear motor for free piston<br>
compressors (also called vibrating and linear compressors) for vapour<br>
compression systems.<br>
Background Art<br>
Compressors, for example refrigerator compressors, are conventionally<br>
driven by rotary electric motors. However, even in their most efficient form, there<br>
are significant losses associated with the crank system that converts rotary<br>
motion to linear reciprocating motion. Alternatively a rotary compressor which<br>
does not require a crank can be used but again there are high centripetal loads,<br>
leading to significant frictional losses. A Linear compressor driven by a linear<br>
motor would not have these losses, and can be designed with a bearing load low<br>
enough to allow the use of aerostatic gas bearings as disclosed in US Patent<br>
5,525,845.<br>
Linear reciprocating motors obviate the need for crank mechanisms which<br>
characterise compressors powered by rotating electric motors and which<br>
produce high side forces requiring oil lubrication. Such a motor is described in<br>
US 4,602,174. US Patent 4,602,174 discloses a linear motor design that is<br>
extremely efficient in terms of both reciprocating mass and electrical efficiency.<br>
This design has been used very successfully in motors and alternators that<br>
utilise the Stirling cycle. It has also been used as the motor for linear<br>
compressors. However, in the case of compressors designed for household<br>
refrigerators the design in US 4,602,174 is somewhat larger and more costly<br>
than is desirable for this market.<br>
The piston of a free piston compressor oscillates in conjunction with a<br>
spring as a resonant system and there are no inherent limits to the amplitude of<br>
oscillation except for collision with a stationary part, typically part of the cylinder<br>
head assembly. The piston will take up an average position and amplitude that<br>
depend on gas forces and input electrical power. Therefore for any given input<br>
electrical power, as either evaporating or condensing pressure reduces, the<br>
amplitude of oscillation increases until collision occurs. It is therefore necessary<br>
to limit the power as a function of these pressures.<br>
It is desirable for maximum efficiency to operate free piston refrigeration<br>
compressors at the natural frequency of the mechanical system. This frequency<br>
is determined by the spring constant and mass of the mechanical system and<br>
also by the elasticity coefficient of the gas. In the case of refrigeration, the<br>
elasticity coefficient of the gas increases with both evaporating and condensing<br>
pressures. Consequently the natural frequency also increases. Therefore for<br>
best operation the frequency of the electrical system powering the compressor<br>
needs to vary to match the mechanical system frequency as it varies with<br>
operating conditions.<br>
Methods of synchronising the electrical voltage applied to the compressor<br>
motor windings with the mechanical system frequency are well known. For a<br>
permanent magnet motor used in a free piston compressor, a back electromotive<br>
force (back EMF) is induced in the motor windings proportional to the piston<br>
velocity as shown in Fig 8a. The equivalent circuit of the motor is shown in Fig<br>
8b. An alternating voltage (V) is applied in synchronism with the alternating EMF<br>
(av) in order to power the compressor. US 4,320,448 (Okuda et al.) discloses a<br>
method whereby the timing of the applied voltage is determined by detecting the<br>
zero crossings of the motor back EMF. The application of voltage to the motor<br>
winding is controlled such that the current is zero, at the time at which the EMF<br>
intersects with the zero level to allow back EMF zero crossing detection.<br>
Various methods have been used to limit oscillation amplitude including<br>
secondary gas spring, piston position detection, piston position calculation based<br>
on current and applied voltage (US 5,496,153) measuring ambient and/or<br>
evaporating temperature (US 4,179,899, US 4,283,920). Each of these methods<br>
requires the cost of additional sensors or has some performance limitation.<br>

MODE(S) FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a linear motor with a number of<br>
improvements over the prior art. Firstly it has a reduced size compared to the<br>
conventional linear motor of the type described in US4602174 and thus reduces<br>
the cost. This change keeps the efficiency high at low to medium power output at<br>
the expense of slightly reduced efficiency at high power output. This is an<br>
acceptable compromise for a compressor in a household refrigerator which runs<br>
at low to medium power output most of the time and at high power output less<br>
than 20% of the time (this occurs during periods of frequent loading and<br>
unloading of the refrigerator contents or on very hot days). Secondly it uses a<br>
control strategy which allows optimally efficient operation, while negating the<br>
need for external sensors, which also reduces size and cost.<br>
While in the following description the control strategy is described in<br>
relation to a cylindrical linear motor it will be appreciated that this method is<br>
equally applicable to linear motors in general and in particular also to flat linear<br>
motors. While the invention is described in relation to a free piston compressor it<br>
could equally be used in a diaphragm compressor.<br>
A practical embodiment of the invention, shown in Figure 1, involves a<br>
permanent magnet linear motor connected to a reciprocating free piston<br>
compressor. The cylinder 9 is supported by a cylinder spring 14 within the<br>
compressor shell 30. The piston 11 is supported radially by the bearing formed<br>
by the cylinder bore plus its spring 13 via the spring mount 25.<br>
The reciprocating movement of piston 11 within cylinder 9 draws gas in<br>
through a suction tube 12 through a suction port 26 through a suction muffler 20<br>
and through a suction valve port 24 in a valve plate 21 into a compression space<br>
28. The compressed gas then leaves through a discharge valve port 23, is<br>
silenced in a discharge muffler 19, and exits through a discharge tube 18.<br>
The compressor motor comprises a two part stator 5,6 and an armature<br>
22. The force which generates the reciprocating movement of the piston 11<br>
comes from the interaction of two annular radially magnetised permanent<br>
magnets 3,4 in the armature 22 (attached to the piston 11 by a flange 7), and the<br>
magnetic field in an air gap 33 (induced by the stator 6 and coils 1,2).<br>
A two coil embodiment of present invention, shown in Figure 1 and in<br>
isolation in Figure 2, has a current flowing in coil 1, which creates a flux that<br>
flows axially along the inside of the stator 6, radially outward through the end stator tooth 32, across the air gap 33,<br>
then enters the back iron 5. Then it flows axially for a short distance 27 before flowing<br>
radially inwards across the air gap 33 and back into the centre tooth 34 of the stator 6. The<br>
second coil 2 creates a flux which flows radially in through the centre tooth 34 across the air<br>
gap axially for a short distance 29, and outwards through the air gap 33 into the end tooth 35.<br>
The flux crossing the air gap 33 from tooth 32 induces an axial force on the radially<br>
magnetised magnets 3,4 provided that the magnetisation of the magnet 3 is of the opposite<br>
polarity to the other magnet 4. It will be appreciated that instead of the back iron 5 it would<br>
be equally possible to have another set of coils on the opposite sides of the magnets.<br>
An oscillating current in coils 1 and 2, not necessarily sinusoidal, creates an<br>
oscillating force on the magnets 3,4 that will give the magnets and stator substantial relative<br>
movement provided the oscillation frequency is close to the natural frequency of the<br>
mechanical system. This natural frequency is determined by the stiffness of the springs13,<br>
14 and mass of the cylinder 9 and stator 6. The oscillating force on the magnets 3,4 creates<br>
a reaction force on the stator parts. Thus the stator 6 must be rigidly attached to the cylinder<br>
9 by adhesive, shrink fit or clamp etc. The back iron is clamped or bonded to the stator<br>
mount 17. The stator mount 17 is rigidly connected to the cylinder 9.<br>
In a single coil embodiment of the present invention, shown in Figure 3, current in<br>
coil 109, creates a flux that flows axially along the inside of the inside stator 110, radially<br>
outward through one tooth 111, across the magnet gap 112, then enters the back iron 115.<br>
Then it flows axially for a short distance before flowing radially inwards across the magnet<br>
gap 112 and back into the outer tooth 116. In this motor the entire magnet 122 has the same<br>
polarity in its radial magnetisation.<br>
In the preferred embodiment of the present invention the length of the armature<br>
(tooth) faces only extends to, for example, 67% of the maximum, stroke (where the edge of<br>
the magnet extends to at maximum power output) of the magnet. This is seen in Figure 4<br>
where a conventional prior art linear motor is visually compared against the present invention<br>
variable constant design of equivalent power output, both at maximum stroke. It can be seen<br>
that the outer edge 200 of the stator tooth does not extend as far as the outer end of the<br>
magnet 201. Similarly the inner edge 203 of the other stator tooth does not extend to the<br>
inner end of the magnet 204. In contrast in the prior art design the edge of the magnet 205<br>
SUBSTITUE SHEET (Rule 26)<br>
docs match up. with the edges of the stator teeth 206,207 at maximum stroke.<br>
At strokes less than, for example, 60% in the present invention the magnet 70 will be<br>
in an area of uniform flux density as indicated by the region "a" to "b" in Figure 5, which<br>
roughly corresponds where the stator teeth 71 extend to. As the stroke increases past 60%<br>
the flux density encountered by the magnet edge 70 reduces as it enters the fringe portion<br>
(non-uniform flux density) of the air gap magnetic field - the area outside "b" in Figure 5.<br>
In a further embodiment shown in Figure 7, a stator for a linear motor is shown with<br>
angled pole face 503. In its centre the pole face 503 has a flat section 500, which results in<br>
the air gap facing that section having substantially uniform flux density. The end of the pole<br>
face 503, is angled to give a more progressive transition from the uniform flux density of the<br>
centre 500, to the fringe portion 502 (non-uniform flux density) at the end of the pole face<br>
503. Similar to the proceeding embodiments the armature magnet 504, would be driven<br>
outside me area of uniform flux density 500, and into the fringe portion 502 of non-uniform<br>
flux density.<br>
The "Motor Constant" is defined as the force (in Newtons) generated on the magnet<br>
by one Ampere in the motor windings. The motor constant curve, shown in Figure 6 shows<br>
how the Motor Constant 300 for the present invention varies with magnet position. Equally<br>
the "Motor Constant" can be defined as the back EMF (in Volts) generated when the magnet<br>
is moving at one metre/second. When the magnet is in the fringe field (outside "b" in Figure<br>
5), because of the reduced magnetic coupling, more current will be required to generate a<br>
given force when compared to that in the uniform flux region (from "a" to "b" in Figure 5).<br>
This results in the "variable" motor constant curve 300 associated with the present invention<br>
short stator linear motor as shown in Figure 6. This contrasts with the "constant" motor<br>
constant curve 301, also seen in Figure 6, inherent in the conventional prior art linear motors.<br>
With the motor constant curve 300 shown in Figure 6 at low and medium strokes<br>
(corresponding to strokes of-3mm to +3mm) it will be apparent the present invention has<br>
a high motor constant relative to an equivalent convention motor 301, (with less turns and<br>
a greater volume of core material). A higher motor constant corresponds to more efficient<br>
operation (due to lower invertor losses), therefore at lower power output the present<br>
invention is more efficient than an equivalent conventional prior art linear motor. It also<br>
SUBSTTTUE SHEET (Rule 26)<br>
reduces the required cross sectional area of the core.<br>
At high strokes the motor constant is low at the times when the current is increasing<br>
most rapidly. This makes it possible to get more current into the motor and thus extract more<br>
power from the motor at maximum strokes as compared to an equivalent conventional prior<br>
art linear motor. Also such a design with a variable constant that is lowest at maximum<br>
stroke tends to make motors driven by square wave voltages more efficient.<br>
Control Strategy<br>
Experiments have established that a free piston compressor is most efficient when<br>
driven at the natural frequency of the compressor piston-spring system. However as well as<br>
any deliberately provided metal spring, there is an inherent gases spring, the effective spring<br>
constant of which, in the case of a refrigeration compressor, varies as either evaporator or<br>
condenser pressure varies. The electronically commutated permanent magnet motor already<br>
described, is controlled using techniques including those derived from the applicant"s<br>
experience in electronically commutated permanent magnet motors as disclosed in US<br>
4857814 and WO 98/35428 for example, the contents of which are incorporated herein by<br>
reference. Those references disclose the control of a 3 phase rotating motor, but the same<br>
control principles can be applied to linear motors. A suitable linear motor need only be a<br>
single phase device and a suitable inverter bridge circuit for powering a motor can be of the<br>
simple form shown in Figure 9.<br>
By monitoring back EMF zero crossings in the motor winding current commutation<br>
can be determined to follow the natural frequency of the piston. Since there is only a single<br>
winding, the current flowing through either upper or lower inverter switching devices 411<br>
or 412 must be interrupted so that back EMF can be measured. Controlling the current<br>
through the motor winding in accordance with detected back EMF ensures current and back<br>
EMF are maintained in phase for maximum system efficiency.<br>
The frequency of operation of the motor is effectively continuously monitored as<br>
frequency is twice the reciprocal of the time between back EMF zero crossings. Furthermore<br>
according to WO 98/35428 the current decay time through free wheel diodes 413 and 414<br>
after commutation has ceased is directly proportional to the motor current and thus a measure<br>
of motor current is available.<br>
The maximum motor current that can be employed before the piston collides with the<br>
SUBSTITUE SHEET (Rule 26)<br>
cylinder head of the compressor varies depending upon the evaporator temperature and the<br>
natural frequency of the vibrating system<br>
Figure 10 shows graphs of maximum permitted motor current against natural<br>
mechanical system frequency and condenser temperatures for different evaporating<br>
temperatures. These show the dependence of maximum motor current on both these<br>
variables. They also demonstrate that condenser temperatures are proportional to mechanical<br>
system frequency and thus maximum current control can be achieved without the need for<br>
measurement of the third variable, condenser temperature.<br>
The motor control circuit according to this invention is shown in Figure 11. It utilises<br>
the observation that mechanical system frequency is related to condenser temperature. In<br>
this invention the back EMF signal induced in the motor windings 1 is sensed and digitised<br>
by circuit 402 and applied to the input of a microcomputer 403 which computes the<br>
appropriate timing for the commutation of current to the motor windings to ensure that the<br>
current is in phase with the back EMF. These commutation timing signals switch an inverter<br>
404 (as shown in Figure 11) which delivers current to the motor windings 401. The<br>
microcomputer 403 also measures the time between back EMF zero crossings and thereby<br>
the period of the EMF waveform. The natural oscillation frequency of the mechanical<br>
system is the inverse of the period of the EMF waveform. The microcomputer 403 therefore<br>
has a measure of this frequency at all times.<br>
The conventional temperature sensor 405 for measuring the evaporator temperature<br>
for defrost purposes is utilised and its output is digitised and supplied as a further input to<br>
microcomputer 403.<br>
According to the present invention one method of limiting maximum motor current<br>
and thus maximum displacement of the piston is for the microcomputer 403 to calculate a<br>
maximum current amplitude for each half cycle of piston oscillation and limit the actual<br>
current amplitude to less than the maximum. WO 98/35428)discloses a method of measuring<br>
motor current in an electronically commutated permanent magnet motor by utilising the<br>
digitised back EMF signal in an unpowered winding to measure the time taken for the current<br>
in the motor winding to decay to zero. Use this technique in the present invention enables<br>
Microcomputer 403 to limit maximum power without the need for dedicated current sensing<br>
or limiting circuitry .The RMS moter current is directly proportional to the time duration of<br>
SUBSTITUE SHEET (Rule 26)<br>
current decay through the "freewheeling" diodes 413 or 414 after the associated inverter<br>
switching device has switched off. The current decay results of course from the motor<br>
winding being an inductor which has stored energy during commutation and which must be<br>
dissipated after commutation has ceased. A graph of RMS moter current against current<br>
decay duration (which is a simplification of Figure 6 is WO 98/35428 is shown in Figure<br><br>
12.<br>
Another preferred method is to limit the time that the current is commutated on<br>
instead of limiting the maximum current value. Figure 15 shows the current waveform under<br>
such control. This is in effect pulse width modulation (PWM) with only one modulated<br>
current pulse per commutation interval. With this method a delay time from the back EMF<br>
zero crossing is computed to minimise the phase angle between the Motor Current and the<br>
back EMF for maximum efficiency. The invertor switch supplying current is turned off at<br>
a time in the motor half cycle to allow, after a current decay period, time to monitor zero<br>
crossing of the back EMF to determine the start commutation for the next half cycle. The<br>
commutation time is also compared with a maximum commutation time appropriate to the<br>
motor frequency and evaporator temperature to ensure maximum amplitude of the piston<br>
stroke is not exceeded.<br>
A flow diagram of the microcomputer control strategy to implement this method is<br>
shown in Figures 13 and 14. Referring to Figure 13 when the compressor is first powered<br>
(421), or is powered after sufficient time delay to ensure pressures are equalised in the<br>
refrigeration system, the compressor runs at a minimum frequency. The stroke period of<br>
this minimum frequency is measured as Run_Stroke and shown in the microcomputer as<br>
Low_Stroke and a minimum Commutation Time is set for this value (428). For each<br>
subsequent stroke the stroke period is measured and defined as the parameter Run_Stroke<br>
(424). The difference between Run_Stroke and Low_Stroke is computed (431, Figure 14).<br>
This difference is called Period_Index. The Period_Index is used in this sub-routine as an<br>
index pointer in a lookup table of maximum commutation times for different stroke times<br>
(frequencies). This table is called the Pulse_Limit_Value Table. In this instance there are<br>
7 lookup tables (433 to 439) corresponding to 7 ranges of Evaporating Temperature (440 to<br>
465).<br>
The moter control circuit is typically included in a Temperature Control loop in the<br>
SUBSTITUE SHEET (Rule 26)<br>
conventional manner in order to maintain the temperature of the enclosed refrigerated space<br>
of the refrigeration system. This control loop will be setting desired values for the power to<br>
be applied to the motor windings depending on the operating conditions of the refrigeration<br>
system. These values of desired power will correspond to values of commutation time.<br>
These values of Commutation Time are compared on a stroke by stroke basis with the<br>
Pulse_Limit_Value (440, Figure 14). If the Desired value of commutation time is greater<br>
than the Pulse_Limit_Value then the commutation time is limited to the Pulse_Lirnit_Value.<br>
This value sets the Commutation Timer (425) which controls the ON period of the relevant<br>
inverter switching device. As previously explained, Motor current can also be used in a<br>
similar manner to limit power applied to the motor to safe levels, but even where<br>
commutation time is being controlled it is desirable to measure motor current in the manner<br>
previously described and compare it with a stored absolute maximum value (426) which if<br>
exceeded will cause the microcomputer program to reset (427).<br>
Of course other methods of determining maximum commutation time and/or<br>
maximum current value are feasible, for instance if the microcomputer is sufficiently<br>
powerful, for example recent advances in DSP chip technology, these values can be<br>
computed directly without the need for lookup tables.<br>
If the DC power supply Voltage supplied to the inverter bridge of Figure 9 varies<br>
significantly this will result in variation of Motor Current for any given commutation time<br>
which should be allowed for. It may be desirable for maximum accuracy for the<br>
microprocessor to sense this and compensate accordingly.<br>
It will be appreciated that use of the present invention in a refrigerator reduces the<br>
profile, size and weight of the motor compared to that of conventional designs. Also because<br>
the mass of the moving parts is lower than that of a conventional refrigerator compressor:<br>
the level of vibration is reduced,<br>
the noise level is reduced,<br>
the working stresses on the moving parts are reduced.<br>
