CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS<br>
This invention is directed to indolizines, their preparation, pharmaceutical compositions containing these compounds, and their pharmaceutical use in the treatment of disease states capable of being modulated by the inhibition of JNK activity. These disease states include inflammatory and proliferative disorders as well as those in which tissue degeneration occurs as a consequence of excessive metalloproteinase release and/or apoptosis.<br>
The present invention concerns too particularly novel indolizines derivatives with inhibitory effects towards kinase proteins. Such kinase proteins belong especially to the following group: EGFR, Fak, FLK-1, FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3, FGFR4, FGFR5, flt-1, IGF-1R, KDR, PDGFR, tie2, VEGFR..The indolizines of the present patent application may thus especially be used for preventing or treating diseases that may be modulated by the inhibition of such kinase proteins and particularly solid tumours .<br>
Many proteins including cytokines, adhesion molecules and proteolytic enzymes contribute to the pathology of chronic inflammatory disorders. During inflammation, the transcription and synthesis of inflammatory proteins is increased. This is achieved by the activation of several families of proteins called transcription factors which bind to specific regions of the DNA juxtaposed to the gene to induce transcription and consequently synthesis of the protein.<br>
The Jun family of transcription factors is involved in controlling the transcription of important pro-inflammatory proteins including tumour necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin (IL)-2, y-interferon and E-selectin.<br>
Jun family members form homodimers and heterodimers with other transcription factors, notably members of the fos family to form an AP-1 binding complex. Recent reports indicate that c-Jun also forms heterodimers with ATF-2 and can interact with the p50/p65 subunits of NF-KB. These complexes bind to consensus sequences upstream of the promoters of genes of pro-inflammatory proteins to direct transcription.<br>
Phosphorylation on two serine residues (Ser^ Ser?3) at the N-terminus of c-Jun greatly increases its ability to induce transcription of pro-inflammatory proteins, a process known as transactivation. Upon exposure of cells to a variety of stress- (heat, U.V. light, osmotic stress etc) and inflammatory-stimuli, phosphorylation of c-Jun is increased. An AP-1 site lies in the promotor region of cJun and the same stimuli that increase c-Jun phosphorylation also cause an increase in the intracellular levels of this transcription factor.  This, in turn, induces the<br><br>
expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines which possess sites in their upstream promotors which bind homo- or hetero-dimers of c-Jun and related proteins.<br>
N-terminal phosphorylation and transactivationof c-Jun is a consequence of the activation of c-Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK), the only enzyme known to possess this activity. Upon exposure of cells to a variety of inflammatory stimuli, JNK is activated and migrates to the nucleus where it phosphorylates c-Jun and induces the expression of pro-inflammatory genes. As well as inflammatory agents, a number of cellular stresses (heat, U.V. light, osmotic stress etc) activate JNK, hence the alternative name of this enzyme family, stress-activated grotein kinase (SAPK). JNK is phosphorylated and activated following the triggering of a kinase cascade (stress-activated protein kinase cascade) by inflammatory stimuli, with the final step being catalysed by upstream MAP kinase kinases (MKK)4 and/or 7. There are three distinct JNK genes, JNK-1, JNK-2 and JNK-3. There are four splice of variants each of both JNK-1 and JNK-2 and two of JNK-3. JNK-1 and JNK-2 are widely distributed while JNK-3 is localised predominantly in the brain.<br>
The expression of important pro-inflammatory cytokines including TNF as well as proteolytic enzymes and adhesion molecules is regulated by AP-1-sites or other consensus sequences to which c-Jun binds that are present in the upstream promotor of these genes. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which stimulates release of TNF and other pro-inflammatory proteins, increases JNK activity as well as cJun phosphorylation and expression. Furthermore, LPS increases the binding of c-Jun to AP-1 and other sites that appear to be essential for full expression of pro-inflammatory proteins. c-Jun phosphorylation also plays an important role in signalling by TNF and other pro-inflammatory cytokines. JNK activation, phosphorylation of c-Jun, c-Jun binding to an AP-1 site in the promoter of target genes and AP-1-dependent transcriptional activity are also induced in certain cell-types such as fibroblasts by TNF itself. JNK is also important in regulating the synthesis of metalloproteinases that contribute to the pathology of diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. Knockout mice lacking JNK-3 show reduced apoptosis of hippocampal neurons and a reduced incidence of seizures induced by kainic acid, a glutamate-receptor agonist. Furthermore, knockout mice that lack the N-terminal phosphorylation sites on c-Jun are similarly resistant to the apoptosis of hippocampal neurons and seizures induced by kainic acid. JNK-3 and c-Jun phosphorylation are therefore of significant medical interest in disorders in which neuronal damage occurs, such as stroke. In addition, JNK inhibitors are also of value in other diseases and disorders in which neuronal damage occurs as a consequence of JNK activation occurring as a consequence of aberrant signaling, abnormal protein  processing,   deprivation  of growth   factors,   osmotic  changes  and free-radical<br><br>
generation. These include Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease as well as brain trauma and neuronal damage resulting from cardiac surgery or cardiac arrest.<br>
Thus, inhibition of JNK activity and suppression of cJun phosphorylation is a very attractive target to inhibit release of and responses to pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF, production of metalloproteinases and neuronal apoptosis. Compounds which inhibit JNK will be useful for the treatment of inflammatory diseases in which TNF plays a major pathological role as well as diseases in which tissue distinction occurs as a consequence of excessive metalloproteinase release and apoptosis.<br>
TNF is an important pro-inflammatory cytokine which causes hemorrhagic necrosis of tumours and possesses other important biological activities. TNF is released by activated macrophages, activated T-lymphocytes, natural killer cells, mast cells and basophils, fibroblasts, endothelial cells and brain astrocytes among other cells.<br>
The principal in vivo actions of TNF can be broadly classified as inflammatory and catabolic. It has been implicated as a mediator of endotoxic shock, inflammation of joints and of the airways, immune deficiency states, allograft rejection, and in the cachexia associated with malignant disease and some parasitic infections. In view of the association of high serum levels of TNF with poor prognosis in sepsis, graft versus host disease and adult respiratory distress syndrome, and its role in many other immunologic processes, this factor is regarded as an important mediator of general inflammation.<br>
TNF primes or activates neutrophils, eosinophils, and endothelial cells to release tissue damaging mediators such as adhesion molecules. In fibroblasts, TNF stimulates the production of collagenase, an enzyme implicated in the joint destruction in rheumatoid arthritis. TNF also activates monocytes, macrophages and T-lymphocytes to cause the production of colony stimulating factors and other pro-inflammatory cytokines such IL-1, IL-6, IL-8 and GM-CSF, which in some case mediate the end effects of TNF. The ability of TNF to activate T-lymphocytes, monocytes, macrophages and related cells has been implicated in the progression of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection. In order for these cells to become infected with HIV and for HIV replication to take place the cells must be maintained in an activated state. Cytokines such as TNF have been shown to activate HIV replication in monocytes and macrophages. Features of endotoxic shock such as fever, metabolic acidosis, hypotension and intravascular coagulation are thought to be mediated through the actions of TNF on the hypothalamus and in reducing the anti-coagulant<br><br>
activity of vascular endothelial cells. The cachexia associated with certain disease states is mediated through indirect effects on protein catabolism. TNF also promotes bone resorption and acute phase protein synthesis.<br>
TNF-alpha inhibits surfactant protein C gene transcription, which may contribute to abnormalities of surfactant homeostasis associated with pulmonary injury and infection, induces mucin hypersecretion and mediates the recruitment of neutrophils and eosinophils during airway inflammation. Although TNF-alpha inhibits collagen synthesis in fibroblasts, a number of studies point to it being pro-fibrotic in vivo. Thus, by inhibiting TNF-alpha production, the compounds of the invention have potential in suppressing the airways remodelling that occurs in asthma.<br>
Myocyte apoptosis occurs in myocardial infarction and heart failure. Locally produced cytokines such as Fas or TNFa may contribute to myocyte apoptosis and are upregulated in failing myocardium. In addition, TNFa may play a role in heart failure through it's ability to stimulate remodelling and inhibit contractility. Strategies to inhibit TNFa may be therapeutically useful in heart failure and myocardial infarction. Thus, the compounds of the invention, by inhibiting TNFa release and apoptosis, have potential in the in the treatment of myocardial infarction and heart failure.<br>
The discussion herein relates to disease states associated with TNF including those disease states related to the production of TNF itself, and disease states associated with other cytokines, such as, but not limited to IL-1 or IL-6, that are modulated by associated with TNF. For Example, a IL-1 associated disease state, where IL-1 production or action is exacerbated or secreted in response to TNF, would therefore be considered a disease state associated with TNF. TNF-alpha and TNF-beta are also herein referred to collectively as "TNF" unless specifically delineated otherwise, since there is a close structural homology between TNF-alpha (cachectin) and TNF-beta (lymphotoxin) and each of them has a capacity to induce similar biological responses and bind to the same cellular receptor.<br>
We have now found a novel group of indolizines which have valuable pharmaceutical properties, in particular the ability to inhibit JNK, cJun phosphorylation and the consequential effect in suppressing the expression of proteins (for Example TNF) involved in mediating inflammatory and proliferative disorders.<br>
The present invention concerns then particularly compounds capable to inhibit protein<br>
kinases.<br>
Protein kinases participate in the signalling events which control the activation, growth and<br>
differentiation of cells in response to extracellular mediators and to changes  in the<br><br>
environment. In general, these kinases fall into several groups; those which preferentially phosphorylate serine and/or threonine residues and those which preferentially phosphorylate tyrosine residues [S.K.Hanks and T.Hunter, FASEB. J., 1995, 9, pages 576-596]. The serine/threonine kinases include for Example, protein kinase C isoforms [A.C.Newton, J. Biol. Chem., 1995, 270, pages 28495-28498] and a group of cyclin-dependent kinases such as cdc2 [J.Pines, Trends in<br>
Biochemical Sciences, 1995, 18, pages 195-197]. The tyrosine kinases include membrane-spanning growth factor receptors such as the epidermal growth factor receptor [S.Iwashita and M.Kobayashi, Cellular Signalling, 1992, 4, pages 123-132], and cytosolic non-receptor kinases such as p56tck, p59fYn, ZAP-70 and csk kinases [C.Chan et. al., Ann. Rev. Immunol., 1994,12, pages 555-592].<br>
Inappropriately high protein kinase activity has been implicated in many diseases resulting from abnormal cellular function. This might arise either directly or indirectly, for Example by failure of the proper control mechanisms for the kinase, related for Example to mutation, over-expression or inappropriate activation of the enzyme; or by over- or underproduction of cytokines or growth factors also participating in the transduction of signals upstream or downstream of the kinase. In all of these instances, selective inhibition of the action of the kinase might be expected to have a beneficial effect.<br>
The type 1 insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF-I-R) is a transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase that binds primarily to IGF-I but also to IGF-II and insulin with lower affinity. Binding of IGF-I to its receptor results in receptor oligomerization, activation of tyrosine kinase, intermolecular receptor autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of cellular substrates (major substrates are IRS1 and She). The ligand-activated IGF-I-R induces mitogenic activity in normal cells. Meanwhile IGF-I-R plays also an important role in abnormal growth.<br>
Several clinical reports underline the important role of the IGF-I pathway in human tumor development:<br>
IGF-I-R overexpression is frequently found in various tumors (breast, colon, lung,<br>
sarcoma...) and is often associated with an aggressive phenotype.<br>
High circulating IGF1 concentrations are strongly correlated with prostate, lung and<br>
breast cancer risk.<br>
Furthermore, IGF-I-R requirement for establishment and maintenance of the transformed<br>
phenotype in vitro and in vivo has been largely documented [Baserga R, Exp. Cell. Res.,<br>
1999, 253, pages 1-6].     The kinase activity of IGF-I-R is essential for the transforming<br>
activity of several oncogenes: EGFR, PDGFR, SV40 T antigen, activated Ras, Raf, and v-<br><br>
Src. The expression of IGF-I-R in normal fibroblasts induces neoplastic phenotypes , which can then form tumor in vivo. IGF-I-R expression plays an important role in anchorage-independent growth. IGF-I-R has also been shown to protect cells from chemotherapy-, radiation-, and cytokine- induced apoptosis. Conversely, inhibition of endogenous IGF-I-R by dominant negative IGF-I-R, triple helix formation or antisense expression vector has been shown to repress transforming activity in vitro and tumor growth in animal models.<br>
Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase involved in integrin-mediated signal transduction pathways. FAK colocalizes with integrins in focal contact sites and FAK activation and its tyrosine phosphorylation have been shown in many cell types to be dependent on integrins binding to their extracellular ligands.   Results from several studies support the hypothesis that FAK inhibitors could be useful in cancer treatment. For Example, Fak-deficient cells migrate poorly in response to chemotactic signals and overexpression of FAK C-terminal dominant negative construct blocks cell spreading as well as chemotactic migration (Sieg et al, J. Cell Science,1999, 112, 2677-2691 ; Richardson A. and Parsons T., Cell,   1997,   97,   221-231)   ;   in   addition,   tumor   cells   treated   with   FAK   antisense oligonucleotides lost their attachment and underwent apoptosis (Xu et al,Cell Growth Differ, 1996, 4, 413-418). FAK has been reported to be overexpressed in   many tumor types as prostate, breast, thyroid, colon lung, brain and melanoma cancers.  In addition, the level of expression of FAK is directly correlated with tumors demonstrating   the most aggressive phenotype.<br>
One subject of the invention is thus novel indolizines derivatives with inhibitory effects<br>
towards kinase proteins.<br>
The indolizines of the present patent application may thus especially be used for preventing<br>
or treating diseases that may be modulated by the inhibition of kinase proteins.<br>
Such kinase proteins belong especially to the following group: EGFR, Fak, FLK-1, FGFR1,<br>
FGFR2, FGFR3, FGFR4, FGFR5, flt-1, IGF-1R, KDR, PDGFR, tie2, VEGFR.<br>
Mention is made particularly of the kinase protein IGF1-R.<br>
Mention is made particularly of the kinase protein FAK.<br>
The inhibition or regulation of such kinases proteins thus provides a powerful new<br>
mechanism of action for the treatment of a large number of solid tumours.<br>
The present patent application thus relates particularly to novel inhibitors of the IGF- 1R<br>
receptor that may be used especially for treatment in oncology.<br>

An especially useful class of esters of compounds of formula (I) containing a hydroxy group, may be formed from acid moieties selected from those described by Bundgaard et. al., J. Med.

Some of the compounds of the present invention are basic, and such compounds are useful in the form of the free base or in the form of a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt thereof.<br>
Acid addition salts are a more convenient form for use; and in practice, use of the salt form<br>
inherently amounts to use of the free base form. The acids which can be used to prepare the<br>
acid addition salts include preferably those which produce, when combined with the free<br>
base, pharmaceutically acceptable salts, that is, salts whose anions are non-toxic to the<br>
patient in pharmaceutical doses of the salts, so that the beneficial inhibitory effects inherent<br>
in the free base are not vitiated by side effects ascribable to the anions. Although<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salts of said basic compounds are preferred, all acid addition<br>
salts are useful as sources of the free base form even if the particular salt, per se, is desired<br>
only as an intermediate product as, for Example, when the salt is formed only for purposes of<br>
purification, and identification, or when it is used as intermediate in preparing a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salt by ion exchange procedures. Pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
salts within the scope of the invention include those derived from mineral acids and organic<br>
acids, and include hydrohalides, e.g. hydrochlorides and hydrobromides, sulfates,<br>
phosphates, nitrates, sulfamates, acetates, citrates, lactates, tartrates, malonates, oxalates,<br>
salicylates,	propionates,	succinates,	fumarates,	maleates,<br><br>
methylene-bis-b-hydroxynaphthoates, gentisates, isethionates, di-p-toluoyltartrates, methane-sulfonates, ethanesulfonates, benzenesulfonates, p-toluenesulfonates, cyclohexylsulfamates and quinates and the like.<br>
Where the compound of the invention is substituted with an acidic moiety, base addition salts may be formed and are simply a more convenient form for use; and in practice, use of the salt form inherently amounts to use of the free acid form. The bases which can be used to prepare the base addition salts include preferably those which produce, when combined with the free acid, pharmaceutically acceptable salts, that is, salts whose cations are non-toxic to the patient in pharmaceutical doses of the salts, so that the beneficial inhibitory effects inherent in the free base are not vitiated by side effects ascribable to the cations. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts, including those derived from alkali and alkaline earth metal salts, within the scope of the invention include those derived from the following bases: sodium hydride, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide, aluminium hydroxide, lithium hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, zinc hydroxide, ammonia, ethylenediamine, N-methyl-glucamine, lysine, arginine, ornithine, choline, N,Nf-dibenzylethylenediamine, chloroprocaine, diethanolamine, procaine, N-benzylphenethylamine, diethylamine, piperazine, tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane, tetramethylammonium hydroxide, and the like.<br>
As well as being useful in themselves as active compounds, salts of compounds of the invention are useful for the purposes of purification of the compounds, for Example by exploitation of the solubility differences between the salts and the parent compounds, side products and/or starting materials by techniques well known to those skilled in the art.<br>

Compounds within the scope of the present invention are inhibitors of the generation of tumour necrosis factor (TNF), especially TNF-alpha, according to tests described in the literature and described in vitro and in vivo procedures hereinafter, and which tests results are believed to correlate to pharmacological activity in humans and other mammals. Thus, in a further embodiment, the present invention provides compounds of the invention and compositions containing compounds of the invention for use in the treatment of a patient suffering from, or subject to, conditions which can be ameliorated by the administration of an inhibitor of TNF, especially of TNF-alpha. For Example, compounds of the present invention are useful in the treatment of joint inflammation, including arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and other arthritic conditions such as rheumatoid spondylitis, gouty arthritis, traumatic arthritis, rubella arthritis, psoriatic arthritis and osteoarthritis. Additionally, the compounds are useful in the treatment of acute synovitis, tuberculosis, atherosclerosis, muscle degeneration, cachexia, Reiter's syndrome, endotoxaemia, sepsis, septic shock, endotoxic shock, gram negative sepsis, gout, toxic shock syndrome, chronic pulmonary inflammatory diseases including asthma and adult respiratory distress syndrome, silicosis, pulmonary sarcoidosis, bone resorption diseases, reperfusion injury, graft vs. host reaction, allograft rejection and leprosy. Furthermore, the compounds are useful in the treatment of:-infections such as viral infections, for Example HIV, cytomegalovirus (CMV), influenza, adenovirus and the Herpes group of viruses, parasitic infections, for Example malaria such as cerebral malaria, and yeast and fungal infections, for Example fungal meningitis; fever and myalgias due to infection; AIDS; AIDS related complex (ARC); cachexia secondary to infection or malignancy; cachexia secondary to acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) or to cancer; keloid and scar tissue formation; pyresis; diabetes; and inflammatory bowel diseases such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. The compounds of the invention are also useful in the treatment of diseases of or injury to the brain in which over-expression of TNFa has been implicated such as multiple sclerosis, meningitis and head trauma.<br>
Compounds of the invention may also be useful in inhibiting diseases associated with overproduction of other pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-1, 11-2, 11-6 and IL-8 and increased expression of adhesion molecules such as E-selectin. Inhibitors ofc-Jun phosphorylation may also be useful in diseases in which programmed cell death (apoptosis) results in cell loss and tissue disfunction. For Example, the JNK pathway plays an important role in neuronal degeneration induced by excitatory amino acids, growth factor deprivation, aberrant protein processing, osmotic stress and free radical injury. Therefore inhibitors are useful in the treatment of neurological disorders resulting from acute ischemia (e.g. stroke) and in chronic<br><br>
neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, AIDS dementia complex, neuropathic pain syndrome, olivopontocerebellar atrophy, Parkinsonism, amytrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis. Furthermore, JNK inhibitors are useful in treatment of the neurological sequelae of cardiac surgery and cardiac arrest, brain and spinal injury, peripheral nerve trauma, diabetic neuropathy and neuronal damage induced by neurotoxins.<br>
AP-1 is implicated in cell proliferation and in the mechanism by which oncogenes transform cells and, therefore, compounds of the invention are useful for the treatment of cancer and other proliferative disorders, including atherosclerosis. Indeed, the JNK pathway is highly activated in certain leukemias and colorectal cancer.<br>
JNK by increasing c-Jun phosphorylation and AP-1 activity is important in regulating the release of metalloproteinases (MMPs) which are over produced in a wide number of inflammatory and proliferative diseases. Excessive production of MMPs plays an important role in the growth and spread of malignant tumors, including colorectal, lung, breast, cervical and prostate cancers. Increased release of MMPs contribute to the tissue destruction and remodeling that occur in diseases such arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, periodontal disease, graft-versus-host reaction and inflammatory airway diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Thus, JNK inhibitors are useful for the treatment of inflammatory and proliferative diseases associated with the excessive release of MMPs.<br>
A special embodiment of the therapeutic methods of the present invention is the treating of asthma. The JNK pathway is activated by anti-CD40 stimulation of B-lymphocytes and has been implicated in the proliferation of this cell type and in the release of antibodies, particularly IgE. The compounds of the invention inhibit anti-CD40 plus IL-4-induced IgE release from human tonsillar B-lymphocytes. Thus, they are useful in the treatment of allergic disorders, including asthma, eczema (atopic dermatitis) and rhinitis.<br>
Another special embodiment of the therapeutic methods of the present invention is the treating of joint inflammation.<br>
According to a further feature of the invention there is provided a method for the treatment of a human or animal patient suffering from, or subject to, conditions which can be ameliorated by the administration of an inhibitor of TNF, especially TNF-alpha, for Example conditions as hereinbefore described, which comprises the administration to the patient of an effective amount of compound of the invention or a composition containing a compound of the invention.

Ill) 1. In vitro enzyme assays 1.1 JNK enzyme assays<br>
1.1.1	r33P1-ATP Method<br>
Compounds were assessed for their abilities to suppress JNK1 activity in a filtration assay in which incorporation of the y-phosphate from [y-33P] ATP into GST-c-Jun substrate was measured. Compounds (0.00 IJJM - 30|iM) were incubated with GST-c-Jun (0.5|oM), JNK1 (0.1 nM) and [y-33P] ATP (6pM) for 30 min in 96 well phosphocellulose microtitre plates (Millipore, MAPH NOB 10) before addition of phosphoric acid (1%) to stop the incubation. The plates were incubated at room temperature for a further 5 min before vacuum was applied to draw the assay mix through the filter. The filters were then washed five times with lOOp.1 phosphoric acid (1%), blotted dry on tissue paper and dried completely in a Millipore adapter cassette. Twenty-five microlitres of Microscint scintillant (Packard) were added to each well and the plate sealed with a plate sealer. The incorporation of [33P]-ATP into c-Jun was measured on a Packard Topcount.<br>
1.1.2	Homogenous Time-Resolved Fluorescence Method<br>
The assay is based on homogeneous time resolved fluorescence (HTRF) technology, which<br>
relies on the non-radioactive energy transfer between a europium cryptate donor and an<br>
XL665 acceptor.  GST-ATF2 substrate is incubated with JNK3 enzyme, and the addition of<br>
ATP initiates the enzymatic reaction.   A mixture of XL665 labeled anti-GST antibody and<br>
cryptate labeled anti-phospho-ATF2 antibody is added to determine the extent of substrate<br>
phosphorylation.      The   interaction  between  the  XL665   labeled  anti-GST  antibody  /<br>
phosphorylated GST-ATF2 complex and the cryptate labeled anti-Phospho-ATF2 antibody<br>
induces a resonance energy transfer from cryptate to XL665, which is proportional to the<br>
phosphorylation of the substrate. The fluorescent emissions are read on an LJL Acquest at<br>
665nm and 620nm, and the ratio of the two values is reported. Active compounds inhibit the<br>
enzymatic activity of JNK3, which is reflected by a decrease of the 665nm/ 620nm ratio.<br>
The enzyme reaction is run in 15|il final volume in 384-well format.   Each well contains<br>
1.75^g/ml JNK3, 25mM Hepes (pH 7.4), lOO^M magnesium chloride, 0.05% Triton-X-100,<br>
lOmM DTT, 5% glycerol, 18.2uM ATP, and 96nM GST-ATF2 substrate. The enzyme used was human (His)g-JNK3a2, produced in yeast by Aventis Core Biotech, Vitry, France (Batch<br>
# HUM414, 0.685mg/ml). The enzyme had an apparent molecular weight of 56,600 Da. Following incubation for 30 minutes at 37°C, 24pl of 2.5ng/ml anti-GST-XL and 0.10|ag/ml<br><br>
of anti-phospho-ATF2-cryptate antibodies are added and the plates are incubated for a further<br>
2 hours at room temperature. GST-ATF2 was produced in E.Coli (molecular weight of<br>
38,867  Da) by Aventis Core Biotech, Vitry, France, Batch # JCE3224,   l.lmg/ml).<br>
Antibodies were obtained from CIS Bio as follows: anti-phospho-ATF2-cryptate antibody,<br>
Lot # 004, 310ug/ml; anti-GST-XL665 antibody, Lot # 012, 250^ml.<br>
HTRF readings were taken on the LJL Acquest reader.  In cases where inhibitory activities<br>
of compounds are to be measured, the desired concentrations of the test compound are<br>
included in the enzyme reaction (usually 10"^ to 10"^M). Potency of test compounds is represented by their IC50 values as determined by non-linear regression analysis using<br>
Activity Base Software (IDBS Ltd).<br>
2.	cJun phosphorylation assay<br>
Compounds were assessed for their abilities to suppress phosphorylation of the transcription factor c-Jun using previously published methodology (Hazzalin et al., 1996). Phosphorylation on two serine residues (Ser63 and Ser?3) results in reduced electrophoretic mobility on polyacrylamide gels. Thus, the non-phosphorylated and phosphorylated c-Jun species migrate differently and this can be detected following polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis by Western blotting with an anti-c-Jun specific antibody.<br>
Compounds were tested onC3H10Tl/2 mouse fibroblasts which were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 10% (vol/vol) foetal calf serum (FCS). Confluent cells were made quiescent by incubation for 18 to 24 hours in DMEM containing 0.5%. Serum-starved C3H10T1/2 cells were pretreated with compounds (0.01-10 |iM) or vehicle (dimethyl sulfoxide) for 30 minutes prior to stimulation with anisomycin (50 ng/ml) for a further 30 minutes. Whole cell extracts were prepared and resolved on 15 % polyacrylamide gels (without SDS). Non-phosphorylated and phosphorylated cJun was detected by Western blotting and enhanced chemoluminescence with anti-phospho c-Jun antibody (Santa Cruz).<br>
3.	Measurement of Cellular JNK Inhibition in 3T3 Fibroblasts<br>
The fibroblast cell line (3T3 cells) was obtained from the American Type Tissue Collection and grown in monolayer culture as directed by the supplier. On the day of the experiment, the JNK pathway was activated by exposing cells to 15ng/mL anisomycin for 2 hours in the cell culture incubator. Test compounds were assessed by preincubating indicated concentrations (InM to 30(iM) for 1 hour prior to anisomycin addition.    The<br><br>
reaction was terminated by aspirating the culture media, followed by solubilizing the cell monolayer in electrophoresis sample loading buffer.<br>
A portion of each sample (7.5-15jal) was loaded on a Novex polyacrylamide Tris-glycine 4-12% gradient gel (#EC60355). Gels were run at 150-200V for 1-1.5 hours until the lowest molecular weight marker runs off gel. The protein of interest (c-Jun) migrates at approximately 39kDa. The proteins were transferred to a PVDF membrane (Imobilon P, Fisher Scientific catalog # 1PVH15150) using a Hoeffer semi-dry transfer protocol for 1 hour with voltage to maximum and current set to 200mA. After transfer, membranes were washed for 5' in Tris buffered saline (TBS) containing 1% Tween. The membranes were blocked for 1 hour at room temperature in block buffer (5% Carnation's non-fat dry milk-1% tween 20-TBS). The block buffer was then removed and blots were incubated with primary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology #sc-822) 1:2000 dilution (diluted in block buffer) overnight at 4°C. This primary is a mouse monoclonal directed against a peptide corresponding to amino acids 56-69 of c-Jun of human origin. After primary antibody incubation, membranes were washed twice at room temperature for 30 minutes in TBS containing 1% Tween. Membranes were then incubated for 1 hour with the secondary antibody (Cell Signaling goat anti-mouse IgG #7076) at 1:10,000 dilution in block buffer. The membranes were washed twice for 30 minutes each in TBS containing 1% Tween. Blots were then developed using Pierce Super Signal West Femto luminol/enhancer solution (Pierce#1856189 and #1856190) at 1:1 dilution for 5 minutes. Excess solution was removed; membranes were placed between two transparencies, exposed to film and developed.<br>
4. In Vitro Inhibitory Effects on TNF-alpha Release by Human Monocytes<br>
The effects of compounds on TNF-alpha production by human peripheral blood monocytes (PBMs) are examined as follows.<br>
4.1        Preparation of human peripheral blood monocytes<br>
Freshly drawn blood from normal healthy donors was mixed (4:1, v/v) with sodium citrate (3.8%, w/v). Mononuclear cells were prepared by centrifiigation of the blood on Histopaque-1077 (Sigma Diagnostics) according to manufacturers instructions. The fraction enriched with mononuclear cells was washed and resuspended in Hank's balanced salts solution (HBSS) supplemented with deoxyribonuclease (37.5 U/ml) and human serum albumin (0.3%). Differential (cytospin) cell counts revealed that the monouclear cell fraction routinely comprised 70-80% monocytes.<br><br>
Cells from the mononuclear leukocyte fraction were centrifuged (200g, 10 min, 20°C),<br>
resuspended, at a density of 10^ cells/ml, in RPMI 1640 containing foetal calf serum (FCS)<br>
(1% ), penicillin (50 U/ml) and streptomycin (50 |u.g/ml) and allowed to adhere in 96 well plates. Following incubation (5% CO2, 37°C) for 90 min, medium containing non-adherent<br>
cells was removed and the cells were washed once with fresh medium.<br>
4.2       Measurement of monocyte TNF-alpha release<br>
Adherent cells in culture medium were incubated for 1 h (5% CO2, 37°C) with fresh medium<br>
containing compounds or vehicle (0.1 % dimethylsulfoxide). Compounds were tested within the concentration range of3xlO-9Mto3xlO-6M. LPS (10 ng/ml) was then added to the cells and the incubation continued for a further 18 hours. Cell supernatants were removed into 96 well, 0.22 jim filtration plates for storage at -20°C.<br>
TNF-alpha concentrations in cell supernatants were quantified by sandwich ELISA. Briefly, ELISA plates were coated overnight with 2fig/ml of mouse anti-human TNF-alpha antibody in bicarbonate buffer (pH 9.9). After washing the wells with wash buffer (0.05% (v/v) Tween in PBS),and blocking unoccupied sites (1% BSA in), monocyte supernatant samples or human recombinant TNF-alpha standards were vacuum filtered into the corresponding wells of the ELISA plate. Biotinylated rabbit polyclonal anti-human TNF-alpha antibody (3 |ig/ml) was used as the second antibody and streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase was used as the detection antibody. The peroxidase substrate was 3,3\5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (1MB), in the presence of hydrogen peroxide.<br>
TNF-alpha concentrations in supernatants from control and LPS-stimulated monocyte incubations were calculated by interpolation from a standard (log/log) curve (0.125-16 ng/ml) fitted by linear regression using a Multicalc software program (Wallac U.K., Ltd).<br>
5. Inhibitory effects of compounds on serum TNF-alpha levels in LPS-challenged mice<br>
5.1        Treatment of animals and measurement of murine TNF-alpha<br>
Female Balb/c mice (age 6-8 weeks, weight 20-22g from Charles River, U.K.) in groups of five or more animals are dosed p.o. with compounds (1 to lOOmg/kg) suspended in 1.5% (w/v) carboxymethyl cellulose then challenged after a minimum period of 30 minutes with<br><br>
30mg of LPS i.p. After 90 minutes the animals are killed by carbon dioxide asphyxiation and bled by cardiac puncture. Blood is allowed to clot at 4°C, centrifuged (12,000 g for 5 minutes) and serum taken for TNF-alpha analysis. TNF-alpha levels are measured using a commercially available murine TNF-alpha ELISA kit, purchased from Genzyme (Cat. no. 1509.00), as recommended by the manufacturer. Values for TNF-alpha are calculated from a recombinant murine TNF-alpha standard curve.<br>
6. Inhibitory effects on IgE release from human tonsillar B-lymphocytes<br>
6.1	Isolation of human B-lymphocytes<br>
Human tonsils were obtained from patients undergoing routine tonsillectomy in a local hospital. They were than dissected and mononuclear cells isolated by buoyant density centrifugation over Histopaque. Isolated cells were 70-80% B-lymphocytes, 20-30% T-lymphocytes and 98% pure B cells.<br>
6.2	B-lymphocyte incubations and measurement of IgE<br>
B-lymphocytes were cultured at 1 x lO^cells/well and resuspended in 200|il IMDM/10% FCS together with interleukin (IL)-4 (200U/ml) and anti-CD40 (0.5(xg/ml) for 7 days at 37°C. Samples from the incubations were removed, cell debris removed by centrifugation (lOOOg, 5 min) and IgE in the supernatants was measured by sandwich ELISA.<br>
6.3	Detection of IgE<br>
Micrititre plates (Costar EIA/RIA) were coated overnight at 4°C with 5 M-g/ml of anti-IgE (clone 577 CI) in carbonate buffer (pH 9.6). Plates were then washed (PBS/0.1% Tween) and subsequently blocked for 30 min. at room temperature, with PBS/3% BSA (200^il/well). After washing, IgE standards (0-1000 I.U/ml: 1 I.U is equivalent to 2.4 ng/ml IgE) and cell culture supernatents (diluted 1:10) were added (100 jj/well: 1.5 h at 37°C). The secondary antibody (alkaline phosphatase conjugated goat anti human IgE) was then added (1:500) and incubated for 1 h at 37°C (100 ^1/well). After a final wash, the substrate solution (p-Nitrophenyl phosphate) was added (100(il/well: lmg/ml) and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Finally, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 3M NaOH and the absorbance was read at 405 nm using the Labsystems Multiskan MCC/340 plate reader.<br><br>
7,	Effect of JNK Inhibitors on Cytotoxicity in Cerebellar Granule Cells<br>
Recent results (Dev.Br. Res. 112, 245-253, 1999) have suggested that activation of the PI3K-<br>
Akt signaling pathway prevents neuronal death in cerebellar granule cells by inhibiting the<br>
activation of JNK and the expression of c-jun.   LY294002 is a reversible inhibitor of PI3K<br>
and activates JNKs with subsequent cell death. We have investigated the ability of the JNK<br>
inhibitors to protect against LY294002-induced cell death in a cerebellar granule cell<br>
preparation.<br>
Primary cerebellar cell  cultures were prepared from  7-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats.<br>
Cerebella were carefully collected, dissected free of meninges and cut into 5-7 parts. Tissues<br>
were gently mechanically dissociated after digestion with VERSENE (5 minutes, 37°C). The<br>
cells were seed onto 96-well plates pre-coated with poly-D-lysine (Becton-Dickinson) at a<br>
final density of 1<p cells per well. cultures were maintained at in a humidified atmosphere with co2 and used after the day of culture dmem medium></p>
complemented with 5% fetal calf serum, 5 % horse serum and 30mM potassium chloride in<br>
the presence of an anti-mitotic (IO^IM cytosine arabinoside). The drugs were directly added<br>
to the culture at the indicated concentrations for 24 hours. Neuronal viability was assessed<br>
quantitatively by the colorimetric  measurement  of Mosmann  or  MTT  assay  (1983,<br>
J.Immunol.Methods, 65, 55-63).  Each condition was tested in sextuplicate or triplicate and<br>
the mean values obtained analyzed statistically by one-way ANOVA, followed by Dunnett's<br>
multiple comparison test.<br>
LY294002, an inhibitor of PI3K, induced neuronal death when added to rat cerebellar<br>
granule neurons cultured in medium containing high potassium (Figure 1).    LY294002-<br>
induced cell death is more reproducible in cells that were maintained in culture for 8 or more<br>
days. The dose response for LY294002-induced toxicity was examined by adding 3-lOOjxM<br>
of LY294002 to cultured cerebellar granule cells (Figure 1). To observe a neuroprotective<br>
effect with Example 9(a), cerebellar granule cells must be used after 9 days of culture. This<br>
is consistent with the increase of the expression of JNK during postnatal development.<br>
Example 9(a) produces a dose-dependent protection against LY294002 (30]iM)-induced toxicity with an IC50 of l\iM (Figure 2).<br>
8.	Measurement of JNK Inhibition In Vivo<br>
Male Wistar Rats are housed individually until the start of the experiments, at which point animals are housed in groups of 5 on a 12 hour light/dark schedule. Water and food were available  ad  libitum.     All  experimental  procedures  were  performed  with  approved<br><br>
institutional animal research protocols. Drugs or vehicle can be administered s.c., i.p., or i.v. at varying timepoints before, after, or both before and after administration of kainic acid (lOmg/kg in sterile water, i.p). In certain cases drugs were administered directly into the brain by means of cannulae are implanted into the left lateral ventricle. Animals are observed, scored for seizure severity and then euthanized at different timepoints for evaluation of the amount of total and phosphorylated c-Jun.<br>
This method can also be performed in mice. Male C57BL/6 mice (20-25g) were purchased from Charles River Laboratories. All mice were housed in groups of 5 on a 12 hour light/dark schedule. Water and food were available ad libitum until the day of the experiment. All experimental procedures were performed with approved institutional animal research protocols. Kainic acid is dissolved in water and injected I.P. at 30mg/kg. Compound or vehicle can be administered s.c, i.p., i.v., or Lev., before, after, or both before and after kainic acid administration. Animals are scored for seizure severity, and then euthanized at different timepoints after administration of kainic acid to evaluate the amount of total and phosphorylated c-Jun.<br>
After euthanasia, hippocampi are rapidly dissected out, weighed, and flash frozen on dry ice. Hippocampi are then disrupted by sonication at a tissue concentration of 120 mg dry weight per ml for rat, 60mg/ml for mice using 50mM Tris pH 7.4, 1% tween-20, plus a protease inhibitor cocktail (Boehringer). Samples are then incubated on ice for 30 minutes, then spun for 13,500 rpm, 30 minutes at 4°C. Samples are pooled (60mg for rats, or 30mg for mice) to a total volume of 500pl per sample. Total c-Jun is immunoprecipitated with 5 jag mouse anti c-Jun (Becton Dickenson) and protein A Sepharose (Amersham) overnight. Similarly, phosphorylated c-Jun is immunoprecipitated with 5jj,g mouse anti-phospho(serine 63) c-Jun (Santa Cruz) and protein A Sepharose (Amersham) overnight. The following morning, samples are washed 3 times with 20mM HEPES pH 7.4, 2mM magnesium chloride, ImM EDTA. Samples are then denatured in 4X NuPAGE LDS sample buffer (Invitrogen) by heating for 10 minutes at 70°C Samples are then resolved by electrophoresis on 10% Tris-Bis NuPAGE gels in MOPS buffer at 200 volts for 1 hour. The proteins are then transferred onto PVDF membranes in Tris-glycine-methanol for 1.5 hours. Membranes are blocked in 5% milk in PBS, 0.5% tween-20 for 1 hour, then incubated overnight at 4°C with 1:1000 anti c-Jun antibody (Cell Signaling Technologies). Blots are washed 3 times with PBS-Tween and incubated for 1 hour with 1:10,000 anti rabbit HPR. Finally, the blots are washed 3 times with PBS-Tween and the images developed using West Femto Maximum Luminol reagent. Images are captured and analyzed on a Kodak Image Station (NEN).<br><br>
9. Models of Focal Cerebral Ischemia<br>
Rats (Charles River) are housed 3 per cage with water and food freely available 3 days before use. All surgical procedures are carried out using aseptic conditions and sterilized instruments. Rats weighing 250-350g, are initially anaesthetized with 5% (vv') isoflurane, 30% (w') oxygen and 70% (vW) nitrous oxide and maintained with 1-2% isoflurane by means of a nose cone. Body temperature is maintained at 37°C by a heating pad placed under the animal and the temperature is monitored (BAT-10 thermometer, Physitemp, Clifton, U.S.A.) throughout the surgery with a rectal temperature probe.<br>
9.1	Permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) by coagulation<br>
This model of permanent MCAo is performed based on a modified technique described by Tamura et ai, 1981. Rats are placed in a lateral position under an operating microscope. A curved vertical incision approximately 3 mm in length is made between the animal's right orbit and external auditory canal. The temporalis muscle is deflected to allow access for the craniotomy, which is made 3mm anterior and 1mm lateral to the foramen ovale with a dental drill. The dura is incised and the right middle cerebral artery (MCA) exposed and coagulated approximately 2mm proximal to the olfactory tract by bipolar electrocoagulation with fine forceps (Vetroson, V-10 Bi-polar electrosurgical unit, Summit Hill Laboratories, Navesink, NJ, U.S.A.). After coagulation, the artery is cut to avoid re-canulization. The craniotomy is covered with bone wax, the muscle allowed to fall back into place and the wound is sutured.<br>
9.2	Model of transient focal cerebral ischemia by intraluminal filament<br>
The transient model of MCAo is performed based on the technique described by Belayev et al., 1996. The rats are anesthetized as described above. The right common, internal and external carotid arteries are isolated with 5-0 silk suture (Deknatel, Fall River, MA 02720, U.S.A.). During surgery the pressure on the right common artery is released to allow reperfusion every 2-4 minutes. The right superior thyroid artery is isolated and cauterized, while the external carotid is ligated distally with a 5-0 silk suture. Another 5-0 silk suture is loosely tided around the base of external carotid artery. The occipital artery is isolated next ligated with two 5-0 silk sutures and cauterized. The internal carotid and pterygopalatine arteries are then isolated and the pterygopalatine artery about 1 mm below the bifurcation of the internal carotid artery is ligated with a 5-0 silk suture. With the common and external carotid arteries immobilized, an aneurysm clip is placed onto the internal carotid artery. A small incision is made at the distal end of the external carotid. A 3-0 or 4-0 nylon suture approximately 30mm long, coated with poly-L-lysine (Sigma St. Louis, MO 63178, U.S.A.) is then inserted into the external carotid artery and extended into the common carotid artery.<br><br>
The loosely tied 5-0 silk suture around the external carotid is now gently tightened around the monofilament. The remaining piece of the external carotid artery with the filament is rotated so that the monofilament could be inserted into the lumen of the internal carotid artery. After the insertion of 18 to 22mm of the monofilament into the lumen of the internal carotid artery (dependent upon the weight of the animal) the blood flow to the MCA is blocked. The neck incision is then closed with 5-0 silk suture using an interrupted stitch. After removal of the temperature probe and discontinuation of the anesthesia, the animal is allowed to awaken. Two hours after MCAo the rat is then re-anesthetized with the same anesthetic combination used initially and placed back into the nose cone. The neck incision is re-opened to expose the external and common carotid artery as described above. The restoration of blood flow is accomplished by completely withdrawing the intraluminal monofilament from the external carotid artery and tightening the suture around the external carotid artery. The incision is then sutured closed with 5-0 silk with an interrupted stitch as before. The rat is allowed to awaken from anesthesia and returned to the cage.<br>
9.3       Model of permanent focal cerebral ischemia using an intraluminal filament<br>
This model of permanent MCAo, originally described by Longa et al., 1989 and modified by Belayev et al., 1996, is similar in technique to that described above for the transient MCAo model. The difference is that once the monofilament is inserted into the internal carotid artery to occlude the MCA, the animal is sutured and allowed to awaken. The filament is never removed and animals are sacrificed 24 hours after MCAo.<br>
Determination of Infarct Volume<br>
Animals are euthanized under isofluorane anesthesia (5% in 70% N2O and 30% O2) for 5<br>
minutes. Following decapitation, the brains are rapidly removed, cut into seven 2mm coronal sections by use of a rat brain matrix (RBM 4000C, ASI Instruments), stained with 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride and then fixed in buffered formalin. The slices are individually captured electronically as digitized images using the MCID Imaging software (MCID M5+, Imaging Research, Inc.). Infarction areas of the digitized images are calculated using AIS software (Analytic Imaging Software, Imaging Research Inc.). The 7 slice areas per brain are summed for volumetric analysis as both a direct infarction volume (mm^) or indirect volume (% Infarction) to compensate for edema formation in the ipsilateral hemisphere (Swanson et al., 1990).<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
