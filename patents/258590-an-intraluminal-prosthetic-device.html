CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
This application claims priority pursuant to 35 U.S.C. ยง 119 (e) to provisional<br>
application 60/622,196 filed on October 26, 2004.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates generally to expandable intraluminal medical devices for<br>
use within a body passageway or duct, and more particularly to a stent having<br>
adjacent hoop sections that are rotationally out of phase, providing flexible links<br>
that minimize foreshortening during stent deployment.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The use of intraluminal prosthetic devices has been demonstrated to present<br>
an alternative to conventional vascular surgery. Intraluminal prosthetic devices<br>
are commonly used in the repair of aneurysms, as liners for vessels, or to<br>
provide mechanical support to prevent the collapse of stenosed or occluded<br>
vessels.<br>
Intraluminal endovascular prosthetics involves the percutaneous insertion of a<br>
generally tubular prosthetic device, such as a stent, into a vessel or other<br>
tubular structure within the vascular system. The stent is typically delivered to<br>
a specific location inside the vascular system in a compressed state by a<br>
catheter. Once delivered to the desired location, the stent is deployed by<br>
expanding the stent into the vessel wall. The expanded stent typically has a<br>
diameter that is several times larger than the diameter of the stent in its<br>
compressed state. The expansion of the stent may be performed by several<br>
methods known in the art, such as by a mechanical expansion device (balloon<br>
catheter expansion stent) or by self-expansion.<br>
The positioning of the stent within the vessel is a critical factor that affects the<br>
performance of the stent and the success of the medical procedure. Since the<br>
region in the vessel lumen at which the stent is to be deployed is usually very<br><br>
difficult for a physician to access, it is essential that the stent's deployed<br>
diameter and length be known before the physician can accurately position the<br>
correctly sized device.<br>
Careful sizing of the correct stent for the desired region of the vessel lumen<br>
may be a difficult challenge for many physicians. Although the dimensions of<br>
the body vessel at the region may be known, uncertainty about the stent's<br>
exact deployed diameter and length may lead to less than optimal<br>
performance. One cause for uncertainty in the stent's deployed diameter and<br>
length is a condition known as foreshortening.<br>
Foreshortening can be better understood by defining the condition within the<br>
context of change in the stent length before and after deployment. For the<br>
purpose of this definition, "crimped length" describes the starting point of the<br>
stent - that is the length of the unexpanded stent mounted on a delivery<br>
catheter prior to deployment. The term "deployed length" is defined at the<br>
clinical end point of change - that is the length of the stent deployed within the<br>
lumen. Foreshortening is equivalent to the distance between these two points,<br>
i.e. the difference between the contained ("crimped") and deployed length.<br>
Foreshortening occurs to varying degrees with all stents. This is especially true<br>
for endovascular stents greater than 4 millimeters in diameter. The amount of<br>
stent foreshortening is determined predominately by how the particular stent<br>
design accommodates expansion. For example, self-expanding stents are<br>
commonly deployed by operation of a retractable sheath. As the sheath is<br>
retracted the distal end of the stent is released first. Foreshortening can occur<br>
within this distal segment until the stent anchors on the lumen wall. As the<br>
sheath retraction continues, the proximal segment will foreshorten as it is<br>
deployed.<br>
Balloon-expandable stents also foreshorten during expansion. Stents<br>
deployed by standard catheter balloons invariably see the balloon inflate at the<br>
weakest section first. Typically, the weakest section of the balloon will be at<br><br>
the exposed distal and/or proximal ends, i.e. the sections of the balloon not<br>
supported directly by the catheter or the stent. Accordingly, as the balloon is<br>
expanded the proximal end and/or distal end(s) of the balloon will inflate first.<br>
The inflated end(s) of the stent will experience the pressure of the balloon<br>
pressing outward in a radial direction to expand the stent, and also inwardly in<br>
an axial compressive direction. This axial compressive force causes the<br>
weaker connecting links or "flex links" of the stent to compress, causing the<br>
stent to foreshorten.<br>
What is needed is an intraluminal medical device that will accommodate the<br>
device expansion into the wall of the lumen, while minimizing device<br>
foreshortening.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates generally to expandable intraluminal medical devices for<br>
use within a body passageway or duct, and more particularly to a stent having<br>
adjacent hoop structures that are rotationally out of phase, providing flexible<br>
links that minimize foreshortening during stent deployment.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention the intraluminal prosthetic device<br>
includes a first hoop section having a first circumferential phase orientation<br>
along a longitudinal axis and a second hoop section having a second<br>
circumferential phase orientation along the longitudinal axis. The first<br>
circumferential phase orientation is different than the second circumferential<br>
phase orientation. The prosthetic device additionally includes at least one flex<br>
member having a first and a second end. The first end of each flex member is<br>

sections are oriented such that the first loop members are not axially aligned<br><br>
with the second loop members. The prosthetic device also includes at least<br>
one flex member having a first and a second end, wherein the first end of each<br>
flex member is attached to the first loop and the second end of each flex<br>
member is attached to the second loop.<br>

device includes a first and a second hoop section comprising a tubular<br>
configuration of structural elements having proximal and distal open end, and<br>
defining a longitudinal axis extending there between. The first and the second<br>
hoop sections are oriented such that the second hoop section is rotationally<br>
offset from the first hoop section about the longitudinal axis. The prosthetic<br>
device also includes at least one flex member having a first and a second end,<br>
wherein the first end of each flex member is attached to the distal end of the<br>
first hoop section and the second end of each flex member is attached to the<br>
proximal end of the second hoop section.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention describes an intraluminal medical device having phased<br>
structural sections that will accommodate the device expansion into the wall of<br>
a vessel lumen, while minimizing foreshortening of the device caused by axial<br>
compression of the device components. An intravascular stent will be<br>
described for the purpose of example. However, as the term is used herein,<br>
intraluminal medical device includes but is not limited to any expandable<br><br>
intravascular prosthesis, expandable intraluminal vascular graft, stent, or any<br>
other mechanical scaffolding device used to maintain or expand a body<br>
passageway. Further, in this regard, the term "body passageway"<br>
encompasses any duct within a mammalian's body, or any body vessel<br>
including but not limited to any vein, artery, duct, vessel, passageway, trachea,<br>
ureters, esophagus, as well as any artificial vessel such as grafts.<br>
The structure and flexible component according to the present invention may<br>
be incorporated into any radially expandable stent design, including self-<br>
expanding stents and mechanically expanded stents. Mechanically expanded<br>
stents include, but are not limited to stents that are radially expanded by an<br>
expansion member, such as by the expansion of a balloon.<br>
With reference to the drawing figures, like parts are represented by like<br>
reference numerals throughout the various different figures. By way of<br>
example, strut 108 in Figure 1 is equivalent to strut 308 in Figure 3.<br>
Referring to Figures 1-5, there are illustrated exemplary stents 100, 300 as are<br>
known in the art. Figures 1 and 3 illustrate typical prior art stents 100, 300 in<br>
an unexpanded or crimped, pre-deployed state, while Figures 2 and 5 show the<br>
stents 100, 300 in the fully expanded state. Although Z or S shaped pattern<br>
stents are shown for the purpose of example, the illustration is not to be<br>
construed as limiting the scope of this invention.<br>
Turning now to Figures 1 and 2, a stent 100 comprises a tubular configuration<br>
of structural elements having proximal and distal open ends 102, 104 and<br>
defining a longitudinal axis 103 extending there between. The stent 100 has a<br>
first diameter D1 for insertion into a patient and navigation through the vessels,<br>
and a second diameter D2 for deployment into the target area of a vessel, with<br>
the second diameter being greater than the first diameter.<br>
The stent 100 structure comprises a plurality of adjacent hoops 106(a)-(d)<br>
extending between the proximal and distal ends 102, 104. The hoops 106(a)-<br><br>
(d) include a plurality of longitudinally arranged strut members 108 and a<br>
plurality of loop members 110 connecting adjacent struts 108. Adjacent struts<br>
108 are connected at opposite ends in a substantially S or Z shaped pattern so<br>
as to form a plurality of cells. However, one of ordinary skill in the art would<br>
recognize that the pattern shaped by the struts is not a limiting factor in this<br>
invention, and other shaped patterns may be used. The plurality of loops 110<br>
have a substantially semi-circular configuration and are substantially symmetric<br>
about their centers. Adjacent hoop sections 106 (a)-(d)are in the same<br>
circumferential orientation. That is to say, adjacent loop members 110 are<br>
axially aligned along the longitudinal axis.<br>
The stent 100 structure further comprises a plurality of bridge members or flex<br>
links 114, which connect adjacent hoops 106(a)-(d). Each flex link 114<br>
comprises two ends. Each one end of each flex link 114 is attached to one<br>
loop 110 on one hoop, for example hoop 106(c), and the other end of each flex<br>
link 114 is attached to one loop 110 on an adjacent hoop, for example hoop<br>
106(d). The flex links 114 connect adjacent hoops 106(a)-(d) together at flex<br>
link to loop connection regions.<br>
The Figures generally show a stent having a closed cell design, with the flex<br>
links 114 connected to the adjacent hoop 106 at each loop 110. In any of the<br>
described configurations, the connections between the hoop structures 106<br>
and the adjacent flex link 114 may be made at every loop member 110; or<br>
alternatively, at a subset of the loop members 110 around the circumference of<br>
the hoop 106. In other words, the connected loop members 110 may alternate<br>
with unconnected loop members 110 in some defined pattern around the<br>
circumference of hoop section 106.<br>
Figures 3 and 5 illustrate a typical stent 300 as is know in the prior art. As<br>
shown in Figure 3, stent 300 is in its crimped, pre-deployed state, as it would<br>
appear if it were cut longitudinally and then laid out flat in a 2-dimensional<br>
configuration. Similarly, stent 300 in Figure 5 is a 2-dimensional representation<br>
of the cylindrical stent 300 after deployment; i.e. after radially outward<br><br>
expansion. It should be clearly understood that the stent 300 depicted in<br>
Figures 3 and 5 is in fact cylindrical in shape, similar to stent 100 shown in<br>
Figure 1, and is only shown in the flat configuration for the purpose of<br>
illustration. This cylindrical shape would be obtained by rolling the flat<br>
configuration of Figures 3 and 5 into a cylinder with the top points "C" joined to<br>
the bottom points "D".<br>
The stent 300 is typically fabricated by laser machining of a cylindrical,<br>
stainless steel tube. However, one of skill in the art would understand that<br>
other materials may be used to fabricate the stent, including, for example,<br>
Nitinol or Cobalt-Chromium alloys.<br>
A set of strut members (as shown within the dotted rectangle) form a closed,<br>
cylindrical, hoop section 306 of the stent 300, similar to hoop 106(c) of Figure<br>
1. As described earlier, the hoop section 306 comprises a plurality of loop<br>
members 310 connected by longitudinally arranged strut members 308. The<br>
hoop section 306 can be said to consist of a multiplicity of strut elements with<br>
each strut element consisting of one loop member 310 joined to one strut 308.<br>
Except at the extreme ends of the stent 300, every curved loop member 310 in<br>
adjacent hoops 306 are attached to a flex link that is either an "N" flex link 314<br>
or a "J" flex link 316. A stent 300 that is thus fully connected is called a "closed<br>
cell" stent. However other open and closed cell designs are also contemplated<br>
by the present invention such that every curved loop member 310 may not be<br>
attached to a flex link. For example, the connections between the hoop<br>
structures 306 and the adjacent flex link 314 may be made at every loop<br>
member 310; or alternatively, at a subset of the loop members 310 around the<br>
circumference of the hoop 306. In other words, the connected loop members<br>
310 may alternate with unconnected loop members 310 in some defined<br>
pattern around the circumference of hoop section 306.<br>
Figure 5 shows deployed structural cells 336 having two of the "J" flex links 316<br>
on their perimeter, and deployed special expandable cells 334 having two of<br><br>
the flexible "N" flex links 314 on their perimeter. As noted above,<br>
circumferentially extending sets of cells are formed into hoop-like,<br>
circumferential cylindrical sections (hoop sections 306) with (in this case)<br>
exactly six cells per cylindrical segment. Typically a multi-cell stent would have<br>
at least three cells per hoop section. The stent 300 illustrated in Figures 3 and<br>
5 has exactly two cylindrical hoops (illustrated in the flat as sections 337) of<br>
structural cells 336, and four cylindrical sections 335 of expandable cells 334.<br>
Another way to describe the fully connected configuration of the stent 300 is as<br>
multiple longitudinally spaced sets of hoop sections 306 inter-connected by<br>
either sets of flexible "N" flex links 324 or sets of flexible "J" flex links 326.<br>
Each set of "N" flex links 324 comprises multiple circumferentially spaced "N"<br>
flex links 314 with each "N" flex link 314 being connected to two curved loop<br>
members 310 of adjacent hoop sections 306. The number of "N" flex links 314<br>
in the set of "N" flex links 324 is no more than one-half of the total number of<br>
curved loop members 310 in the loop section 306.<br>
Similarly, each set of flexible "J" flex links 326 consists of multiple<br>
circumferentially spaced "J" flex links 316 with each "J" flex link being<br>
connected to two curved loop members 310 of the hoop section 306. The<br>
number of "J" flex links 316 in the set of "J" flex links 326 is no more than one<br>
half of the total number of curved loop members 310 in the hoop section 306.<br>
As earlier described, Figures 3 and 5 illustrate adjacent hoop sections 306, 506<br>
in the same circumferential orientation. That is, adjacent loop members 310,<br>
510 on adjacent hoop sections are in axial alignment.<br>
Figures 4A and 4B show 3-dimensional, perspective views of the "N" flex link<br>
314 and the "J" flex link 316 of the stent 300 respectively. The "N" link 314<br>
comprises four generally longitudinally extending curved segments 321(b)<br>
connected by three generally circumferentially extending segments 319(b) with<br>
each "N" flex link 314 having two ends that are attached to curved loop<br>
members 310 at attachment points 355. The "N" flex link 314 shown in Figure<br>
4A has a strut width 315 as measured in a direction that is generally along the<br><br>
surface of the stent that is smaller than the wall thickness 325 as measured in<br>
a radial direction from the stent's longitudinal axis 328. Also illustrated in<br>
Figure 4A is the centerline length 360 of the N flex link 314. The centerline<br>
length is directly proportional to flexibility of the flex link.<br>
The strut width 315 for a stent is typically less than 0.10 mm to provide good<br>
flexibility while the wall thickness 325 is typically greater than 0.10 mm to<br>
provide good stent radiopacity. Ideally the ratio of the width 315 to the<br>
thickness 325 is less than 1.0 and preferably less than 0.8. For a stent, the<br>
nominal strut width 315 would typically be 0.08 mm and the nominal wall<br>
thickness 325 is typically 0.12 mm.<br>
The combination of thin strut width 315 and thick wall thickness 325 allows the<br>
"N" flex link 314 to easily lengthen and shorten for increased stent flexibility<br>
while making the "N" flex link 314 relatively stiff with respect to bulging inward<br>
into the lumen of the stent 300. This stiffness enhances the ability of the "N"<br>
flex link 314 to push outward against plaque in a coronary artery after the stent<br>
300 is deployed. In addition it was thought that the thin width 315 of the "N" flex<br>
link 314 would allow the flex link 314 to stretch during stent expansion,<br>
reducing the foreshortening of the stent 300. However, this axial flexibility<br>
contributes to the stent foreshortening.<br>
As illustrated in Figure 4B, each "J" link 316 consists of two generally<br>
longitudinally extending curved segments 321(a) connected by a straight<br>
circumferential segment 319(a), with each "J" flex link 316 having two ends that<br>
are identically attached to curved loop members 310 at attachment points 356.<br>
The "J" flex link 316 shown in Figure 4B has a strut width 317 as measured in a<br>
direction that is generally along the surface of the stent that is smaller than the<br>
wall thickness 326 as measured in a radial direction from the stent's<br>
longitudinal axis 328. Also illustrated in Figure 4B is the centerline length 361<br>
of the "J" flex link 316. The centerline length is directly proportional to the<br>
flexibility of the flex link.<br><br>
As previously described, the stent 300 shown in Figures 3 and 5 can be said to<br>
have adjacent hoop sections 306 that are connected either by multiple "N" flex<br>
links 314 or by multiple "J" flex links 316. Each "N" flex link 314 is shaped so<br>
as to nest together into the adjacent "N" flex link 314 as is clearly illustrated in<br>
Figure 3. "Nesting" is defined as having the top of a first flexible link inserted<br>
beyond the bottom of a second flexible link situated just above that first flexible<br>
link. Similarly, the bottom of the first flexible link is inserted just below the top<br>
of a third flexible link that is situated just below the first flexible link. Thus, a<br>
stent with nested individual flexible links has each individual flexible link nested<br>
into both adjacent flexible links; i.e., the flexible link directly below and the<br>
flexible link directly above that individual flexible link. This nesting permits<br>
crimping of the stent 300 to smaller diameters without having the "N" flex links<br>
314 overlap.<br>
Since stents similar to stent 300 are delivered percutaneously into a body<br>
lumen, the flex links are designed to allow stent 300 to bend with relative ease<br>
as it goes around curved arteries and vessels. To provide this necessary<br>
flexibility, the "N" flex links 314 lengthen on the outside of the bent stent 300<br>
and shorten on the inside of the bent stent 300 as the stent 300 traverses<br>
through the lumen. This increased flexibility, while necessary to<br>
percutaneously deliver the stent 300 to its desired location, may also contribute<br>
to the foreshortening effect described earlier.<br>
While a stent is deploying (opening), the stent's flex connectors start to stretch<br>
and compensate for the foreshortening. If this post-deployed lengthening of<br>
the flex connectors is not large enough (based for the most part upon balloon<br>
lengthening with increasing pressure), the flex connector expansion will not<br>
compensate for the initial foreshortening. Accordingly, in order to minimize<br>
foreshortening, a design that minimizes the axial compressibility of the flex<br>
connector, while minimizing the flex connector ultimate compressibility is<br>
desired.<br><br>
One embodiment of the present invention that minimizes the axial<br>
compressibility of the flex links during stent deployment is illustrated in Figures<br>
6A through 6G. Figure 6A is a perspective view of a stent 600 according to<br>
one embodiment of the present invention. The stent 600 comprises a tubular<br>
configuration of structural elements having proximal and distal open ends 602,<br>
604 respectively, and defining a longitudinal axis 603 extending there between.<br>
As described earlier, the stent 600 has a first diameter D1 for insertion into a<br>
patient and navigation through a vessel, and a second diameter D2 for<br>
deployment into the target area of a vessel. The second diameter D2 is thus<br>
greater than the first diameter D1.<br>
The stent 600 structure is comprised of six (6) hoop sections 606(a) through<br>
606(f) connected by five (5) flex links 614 sections or "sets" (i.e. 624(a) through<br>
624(e)) extending between the proximal end 602 and the distal end 604. The<br>
flex links 614 connect adjacent hoops 606 together at flex link to loop<br>
connection regions 655, identified on Figure 6C. The number of flex link sets<br>
624 is typically one less than the number of hoop sections 606. Although six<br>
(6) hoop sections 606 and five (5) flex link sections 624 are shown for the<br>
purpose of example, one of skill in the art would understand that these<br>
numbers may be greater or smaller, to allow for longer or shorter stents 600 as<br>
would typically be required by the situation presented i.e., the type and size of<br>
the vessel, or location to be supported.<br>
Figures 6B and 6C are magnified perspective views illustrating the structural<br>
element comprising stent 600 according to one embodiment of the present<br>
invention. Each hoop section 606(a) through 606(f) includes a plurality of<br>
longitudinally arranged strut members 608 and a plurality of loop members 610<br>
connecting adjacent struts 608. Adjacent struts 608 are connected at opposite<br>
ends in a substantially S or Z shaped pattern so as to form a plurality of cells.<br>
However, one of skill in the art would recognized that the pattern shaped by the<br>
struts is not necessarily a limiting factor in this invention, and other shaped<br><br>
patterns may be used. The plurality of loops 610 have a substantially semi-<br>
circular configuration and are substantially symmetric about their centers.<br>
Each flex link 614 comprises two generally longitudinally extending "S" shaped<br>
double curved segments 621, one on each end, connected by one generally<br>
circumferentially extending strut segment 619. In one embodiment of the<br>
invention, the double curved S segment 621 comprises a first curve 622 and an<br>
opposingly oriented second curve section 623, wherein the first curve 622 is of<br>
a smaller radius than the second curve section 623. Each curved segment 621<br>
of each flex link 614 is attached at one end to curved loop members 610 on<br>
adjacent hoop sections 606 at attachment points 655 as shown. The strut<br>
segments 619 are all oriented in the same direction. That is to say, all strut<br>
segments 619 are substantially parallel to one another regardless of their<br>
relative position. This configuration is apparent when viewing the stent 600 in<br>
a 2-dimensional configuration.<br>
Figure 6D illustrates the stent 600 according to one embodiment of the present<br>
invention, as it would appear if it were cut longitudinally and then laid out flat in<br>
a 2-dimensional configuration. It should be clearly understood that the stent<br>
600 depicted in Figure 6D is in fact cylindrical in shape, as depicted in Figure<br>
6A, and is only shown in the flat configuration for the purpose of illustration.<br>
This cylindrical shape would be obtained by rolling the flat configuration of<br>
Figure 6D into a cylinder with the top points "C" jointed to the bottom points "D".<br>
Stent 600 depicted in Figure 6D illustrates the relationship between hoop<br>
sections 606(a) though 606(f) and flex link sets 624. That is, the fully<br>
connected configuration of stent 600 comprises multiple longitudinally spaced<br>
sets of hoop sections 606 interconnected by sets of flex links 624. Each set of<br>
flex links 624 comprises multiple circumferentially spaced flex links 614, with<br>
each flex link 614 in the set of flex links 624 connected to two curved loop<br>
members 610 of adjacent hoop sections 606. The number of flex links 614 in<br>
the set of flex links 624 is no more than one-half of the total number of curved<br>
loop members 610 in the loop sections 606.<br><br>
Except at the extreme ends of the stent 600, every curved loop member 610 in<br>
adjacent hoops 606 is attached to a flex link 614. As earlier described, a stent<br>
600 that is fully connected is called a closed cell stent. However, one of skill in<br>
the art would understand that other open and closed cell designs are also<br>
contemplated by the present invention, such that every curved loop member<br>
610 may not be attached to a flex link 614. For example, the connections<br>
between the hoop structures 606 and the adjacent flex link 614 may be made<br>
at every other loop member 610; or alternatively, at a subset of the loop<br>
members 610 around the circumference of the hoop 606 in some defined<br>
pattern.<br>
To reduce the axial compressibility of the flex links 614, each hoop section 606<br>
is circumferentially phased or offset relative to the adjacent hoop section 606.<br>
For example, hoop section 606(a) is circumferentially phased relative to hoop<br>
section 606(b), and so on. This configuration causes the flex link to loop<br>
connection regions 655 on adjacent hoop sections to be out of axial alignment,<br>
which minimizes axial compressibility.<br>
For the purpose of this invention, circumferentially phased hoop sections<br>
means that adjacent hoop sections are rotated or offset relative to one another<br>
about a longitudinal centerline 603 in stent 600. Figure 6B is a close-up<br>
perspective view of the stent 600 illustrating the relative phase angle 631<br>
between hoop sections 606(b) and 606(c). Reference line 632 is a longitudinal<br>
line, parallel to the stent 600 longitudinal axis 603, drawn through the apex of<br>
one particular loop member 610 on hoop 606(b). Similarly, reference line 633<br>
is a longitudinal line, parallel to the stent 600 longitudinal axis 603, drawn<br>
through the apex of the corresponding adjacent loop member 610 on hoop<br>
606(c). The distance 630 is the circumferential offset or arc between hoop<br>
section 606(b) and 606(c). The circumferential offset corresponds to a phase<br>
angle 631 illustrated in Figure 6B.<br><br>
As previously disclosed, the phased hoop sections 606 result in adjacent flex<br>
link to loop connection regions 655 being out of axial alignment. As a result,<br>
each loop 621 of the flex link 614 can interlock with the loop 621 of the<br>
circumferentially adjacent flex link 614 when the stent 600 is nested or<br>
crimped. In addition, the interlock between loop members 621 causes direct<br>
contact between the strut members 619 from circumferentially adjacent flex<br>
links 614. This direct contact provides compressive resistance between<br>
adjacent flex links 614 in a given flex link set 624, and decreases the lateral<br>
distance each flex link 614 may compress during stent deployment. The end<br>
effect of this compressive resistance is a stent with a lower foreshortening<br>
during deployment. In one embodiment of the invention, foreshortening was<br>
reduced by approximately 3 percent over a similar stent without phased hoop<br>
structures.<br>
To accommodate for the circumferential phase between adjacent hoop<br>
sections 606, the flex connectors 614 are necessarily longer. In particular,<br>
each flex connector 614 in the illustrated embodiment has a longer<br>
circumferential strut member 619. There are several benefits of this<br>
configuration. For example, the longer circumferential strut member 619<br>
provides a larger contact area between circumferentially adjacent flex<br>
connectors 614 when the stent 600 is in the crimped configuration. The larger<br>
contact area causes greater compressive resistance against foreshortening,<br>
providing a stent 600 having greater axial stiffness. In addition, the longer<br>
circumferential strut 619 will have a greater tendency to bend in a direction<br>
perpendicular to the stent 600 longitudinal axis, which improves the flex<br>
connector 614 flexibility, which is particularly useful when the stent is being<br>
navigated through tortuous vessel anatomies.<br>
Figures 6E through 6G are partial close-up views of circumferentially adjacent<br>
flex link 614 according to one embodiment of the present invention. Figure 6E<br>
illustrates the relationship between circumferentially adjacent flex links 614<br>
when the stent 600 is in the cut, fully expanded configuration. The loop<br><br>
members 610 of adjacent hoop sections 606 are circumferentially phased;<br>
resulting in circumferential offset distance 630. As can be seen, even with the<br>
offset 630, there is no interlock region when the stent 600 is fully expanded.<br>
Figure 6F illustrates the stent 600 in a partially crimped configuration. As<br>
shown, the interlock region 640 between adjacent circumferential struts 619<br>
begins to form, due in pertinent part, to the circumferential offset between the<br>
adjacent hoop sections 606. By comparing Figures 6E and 6F, it is apparent<br>
that the interlock region 640 is closely related to the circumferential offset 630<br>
between the hoop sections. Accordingly, the greater the offset, the greater the<br>
strut 619 length, which will allow for a greater circumferential offset 640. This<br>
interlock region 640 illustrated will allow for significant foreshortening<br>
resistance even when the stent 600 is partially crimped.<br>
Figure 6G illustrates the stent 600 in the fully nested position, crimped down<br>
and restrained onto the delivery member. In this configuration the S sections<br>
621 of the flex links 614 fully nest in one another, providing a large interlock<br>
region 640 between adjacent circumferential struts 619. This large interlock<br>
region 640 provides a large area of physical contact between adjacent flex<br>
links 614, decreasing the lateral distance the flex link 614 may compress<br>
during stent deployment.<br>
While a number of variations of the invention have been shown and described<br>
in detail, other modifications and methods of use contemplated within the<br>
scope of this invention will be readily apparent to those of skill in the art based<br>
upon this disclosure. It is contemplated that various combinations or sub<br>
combinations of the specific embodiments may be made and still fall within the<br>
scope of the invention.<br>
