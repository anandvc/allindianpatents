The compounds according to the invention can be prepared as described in an exemplary manner in the examples below, or starting from appropriate starting materials using analogous process steps (see, for example, US Patent 4,468,400 or WO 95/27714), or as illustrated quite generally in the schemes below.<br>

The starting materials shown in Schemes 1 and 2 can be prepared, for example, according to the procedures illustrated in Scheme 3 below.<br><br>
Scheme 3:<br>
Exemplary preparation of the starting materials required for Schemes 1 and 2, here with R1, R2 = methyl and various substituents R3.<br><br>
The preparation of the 8-benzyloxy-6-bromoimidazopyridines is carried out in a manner known per se to the person skilled in the art. Conversion of the bromine atom into an ethyl ester radical can be effected by various routes, for example using the Heck carbonylation (with Pd(ll), carbon monoxide and ethanol) or by metallation in the 6-position (with lithium or magnesium) and subsequent Grignard reaction. Metallation also offers the option to introduce other desired groups R3 into position 6. Starting<br><br>
from the ester group, it is possible to introduce further desired groups R3 into position 6, for example hydroxy-1-4C-alkyl radicals (in particular the hydroxymethyl radical), by reducing the ester radical with lithium aluminum hydride, or 1-4C-alkoxy-1-4C-alkyl radicals (in particular l-4C-alkoxymethyl radicals) by subsequent etherification as illustrated in Scheme 3.<br>
To obtain the compounds of the formula 2, the 8-benzyloxy compounds prepared according to Scheme 3 have to be debenzylated. The debenzylation/reduction of these 8-benzyloxy compounds is likewise carried out in a manner known per se, for example using hydrogen/Pd(0).<br>
If compounds of the formula 2 where R3 - -CO-NR31R32 are desired, it is possible to carry out a corresponding derivatization in a manner known per se (conversion of an ester into an amide or direct introduction of the amide radical starting with the 6-bromo compound).<br>
Starting materials with various substituents R1 and R2 are known, or they can be prepared in a known manner, analogously to known compounds, for example based on Scheme 3. Alternatively, derivatizations can also be carried out at the stage of the compounds 1. Thus, using compounds where R2 = H, it is possible to prepare, for example, compounds where R2 = CH3OH (by Vilsmaier reaction and subsequent reduction), where R2 = CI or Br (by chlorination or bromination), where R2 = propynyl (from the corresponding bromine compound using the Sonogashira reaction) or where R2 = alkoxycarbonyl (from the corresponding bromine compound by Heck carbonylation).<br>
The examples below serve to illustrate the invention in more detail without limiting it. Further compounds of the formula 1 whose preparation is not described explicitly can likewise be prepared in an analogous manner or in a manner known per se to the person skilled in the art, using customary process techniques. The compounds named expressly as examples, and the salts of these compounds, are preferred subject matter of the invention. The abbreviation min stands for minute(s), h stands for hour(s) and m.p. stands for melting point.<br><br>

Commercial utility<br>
The compounds of the formula 1 and their salts have valuable pharmacological properties which make them commercially utilizable. In particular, they exhibit marked inhibition of gastric acid secretion and an excellent gastric and intestinal protective action in warm-blooded animals, in particular humans. In this connection, the compounds according to the invention are distinguished by a high selectivity of action, an advantageous duration of action, a particularly good enteral activity, the absence of significant side effects and a large therapeutic range.<br>
"Gastric and intestinal protection' in this connection is understood as meaning the prevention and treatment of gastrointestinal diseases, in particular of gastrointestinal inflammatory diseases and lesions (such as, for example, gastric ulcer, duodenal ulcer, gastritis, hyperacids or medicament-related functional dyspepsia), which can be caused, for example, by microorganisms (e.g. Helicobacter pylori), bacterial toxins, medicaments (e.g. certain antiinflammatories and antirheumatics), chemicals (e.g. ethanol), gastric acid or stress situations.<br>
In their excellent properties, the compounds according to the invention surprisingly prove to be clearly superior to the compounds known from the prior art in various models in which the antiulcerogenic and the antisecretory properties are determined. On account of these properties, the compounds of the formula 1 and their pharmacologically acceptable salts are outstandingly suitable for use in human and veterinary medicine, where they are used, in particular, for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of disorders of the stomach and/or intestine.<br>
A further subject of the invention are therefore the compounds according to the invention for use in the treatment and/or prophylaxis of the abovementioned diseases.<br>
The invention likewise includes the use of the compounds according to the invention for the production of medicaments which are employed for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of the abovementioned diseases.<br>
The invention furthermore includes the use of the compounds according to the invention for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of the abovementioned diseases.<br>
A further subject of the invention are medicaments which comprise one or more compounds of the formula 1 and/or their pharmacologically acceptable salts.<br>
The medicaments are prepared by processes which are known per se and familiar to the person skilled in the art. As medicaments, the pharmacologically active compounds according to the invention (= active compounds) are either employed as such, or preferably in combination with suitable pharmaceutical auxiliaries or excipients in the form of tablets, coated tablets, capsules, suppositories, patches  (e.g.  as  TTS),  emulsions,  suspensions  or  solutions,  the  active  compound  content<br><br>
advantageously being between 0.1 and 95% and it being possible to obtain a pharmaceutical administration form exactly adapted to the active compound and/or to the desired onset and/or duration of action (e.g. a sustained-release form or an enteric form) by means of the appropriate selection of the auxiliaries and excipients.<br>
The auxiliaries and excipients which are suitable for the desired pharmaceutical formulations are known to the person skilled in the art on the basis of his/her expert knowledge. In addition to solvents, gel-forming agents, suppository bases, tablet auxiliaries and other active compound excipients, it is possible to use, for example, antioxidants, dispersants, emulsifiers, antifoams, flavor corrigents, preservatives, solubilizers, colorants or, in particular, permeation promoters and complexing agents (e.g. cyclodextrins).<br>
The active compounds can be administered orally, parenterally or percutaneously.<br>
In general, it has proven advantageous in human medicine to administer the active compound(s) in the case of oral administration in a daily dose of approximately 0.01 to approximately 20, preferably 0.05 to 5, in particular 0.1 to 1.5, mg/kg of body weight, if appropriate in the form of several, preferably 1 to 4, individual doses to achieve the desired result. In the case of a parenteral treatment, similar or (in particular in the case of the intravenous administration of the active compounds), as a rule, lower doses can be used. The establishment of the optimal dose and manner of administration of the active compounds necessary in each case can easily be carried out by any person skilled in the art on the basis of his/her expert knowledge.<br>
If the compounds according to the invention and/or their salts are to be used for the treatment of the abovementioned diseases, the pharmaceutical preparations can also contain one or more pharmacologically active constituents of other groups of medicaments, for example: tranquillizers (for example from the group of the benzodiazepines, for example diazepam), spasmolytics (for example, bietamiverine or camylofine), anticholinergics (for example, oxyphencyclimine or phencarbamide), local anesthetics, (for example, tetracaine or procaine), and, if appropriate, also enzymes, vitamins or amino acids.<br>
To be emphasized in this connection is in particular the combination of the compounds according to the invention with pharmaceuticals which inhibit acid secretion, such as, for example, H2 blockers (e.g. cimetidine, ranitidine), H*/K* ATPase inhibitors (e.g. omeprazole, pantoprazole), or further with so-called peripheral anticholinergics (e.g. pirenzepine, telenzepine) and with gastrin antagonists with the aim of increasing the principal action in an additive or super-additive sense and/or of eliminating or of decreasing the side effects, or further the combination with antibacterially active substances (such as, for example, cephalosporins, tetracyclines, penicillins, macrolides, nitroimidazoles or alternatively bismuth salts) for the control of Helicobacter pylori. Suitable antibacterial co-components which may be mentioned are, for example, mezlocillin, ampicillin, amoxicillin, cefalothin, cefoxitin, cefotaxime,<br><br>
imipenem,   gentamycin,   amikacin,   erythromycin,   ciprofloxacin,   metronidazole,   clarithromycin, azithromycin and combinations thereof (for example clarithromycin + metronidazole).<br><br>
Pharmacology<br>
The excellent gastric protective action and the gastric acid secretion-inhibiting action of the compounds according to the invention can be demonstrated in investigations on animal experimental models. The compounds according to the invention investigated in the model mentioned below have been provided with numbers which correspond to the numbers of these compounds in the examples.<br>

Methodology<br>
The abdomen of anesthetized rats (CD rat, female, 200-250 g; 1.5 g/kg i.m. urethane) was opened after tracheotomy by a median upper abdominal incision and a PVC catheter was fixed transorally in the esophagus and another via the pylorus such that the ends of the tubes just projected into the gastric lumen. The catheter leading from the pylorus led outward into the right abdominal wall through a side opening.<br>
After thorough rinsing (about 50-100 ml), warm (37Â°C) physiological NaCI solution was continuously passed through the stomach (0.5 ml/min, pH 6.8-6.9; Braun-Unita I). The pH (pH meter 632, glass electrode EA147; 4 = 5 mm, Metrohm) and, by titration with a freshly prepared 0.01 N NaOH solution to pH 7 (Dosimat 665 Metrohm), the secreted HCI were determined in the effluent in each case collected at an interval of 15 minutes.<br>
The gastric secretion was stimulated by continuous infusion of 1 ng/kg (= 1.65 ml/h) of i.v. pentagastrin (left femoral vein) about 30 min after the end of the operation (i.e. after determination of 2 preliminary fractions). The substances to be tested were administered intraduodenally in a 2.5 ml/kg liquid volume 60 min after the start of the continuous pentagastrin infusion.<br><br>
The body temperature of the animals was kept at a constant 37.8-38Â°C by infrared irradiation and heat pads (automatic, stepless control by means of a rectal temperature sensor).<br><br>
