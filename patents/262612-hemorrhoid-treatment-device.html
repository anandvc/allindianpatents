				<td>HEMORRHOID TREATMENT DEVICE<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001] The present invention relates to apparatus for the treatment of hemorrhoids. More particularly, the present invention relates to devices for massaging internal and external hemorrhoids by the self-movement of the device. The present invention also relates to devices that are held within the anal canal and are driven by the peristaltic activity of the surface of the anal canal for the purpose of massaging internal and external hemorrhoids.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] There are several anal treatment dilators and various mechanical devices, which are intended to facilitate the treatment of hemorrhoidal tissues. For example, U.S. Patent No. 3,675,642-issued on July 11,1942 is a post operative stationary device for enlargement of the anal canal. This device having more than 1.25 inches diameter and a shoulder at the bottom of the device that restricts free movement of the device. The device's big diameter induces the evacuative response of the anorectal area. Also the diameter of the device narrows by less than 1.5 inches from the base flange toward the end of the device. This large area of the narrowing tapered surface toward a bland end of the device receives a downward thrust force from the lateral pressure of the anorectal area. Some support is necessary to keep this device inside the anal canal.<br>
[0003] US Patent No. 4,263,914 massages the anal canal manually. US. PatentNo. 4,583,542 issued on April 22,1986 to Z.R. Boyd, describes a stationary device with free self movement restricted by a steep circumferential shoulder of the head and a large flange associated with the device. This device is intended to stay in a stationary position. U.S. PatentNo. 5,797,950 to the present inventor utilizes anal sphincter contractions to massage the prostate by reciprocal linear movement of the apparatus held by a rod set against the perineum region.<br>
[0004] U.S. Patent No. 6,589,193 to the present inventor utilizes the entire anal canal's static and dynamic lateral pressure and the peristaltic activity of the anal canal to massage the internal and external hemorrhoids. With the exception of U.S. patent No. 6,589,193, no previous invention mobilizes the apparatus to massage the internal and external hemorrhoids by the activity of the pecten and the peristalistic movement within the anal canal.<br>
[0005] It is an object of the present invention to induce a peristaltic movement inside the anal canal. The device is held by the pecten and driven slightly back and forth by the peristaltic activity within<br><br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0014] FIGURE 1 shows a hemorrhoid treatment device 10 in accordance with the preferred embodiment of the present invention. The device 10 is utilized so as to work with the pecten within the anal canal. This pecten is a narrow concave section of the anal canal.<br>
[0015] The device 10 has a size suitable for fitting into a human anal canal, the device 10 has a first end section 11, a middle section 20 and a concaved section 17. The first end section 11 has a top end 5, bulbous upper portion 7, a cylindrical surface 14 extending from the upper portion 7 to an end 15 of the middle section. The end 15 is indicated by a broken line "h". The middle section 20 is located between the end 15 and a first end 16 of the concaved section 17. The middle section 20 having a cylindrical surface 21 extending from the end 15 to the first end 16. The concaved section 17 having a concavity extending from the first end 16 to the second end 18 of the concaved section 17. The second end 18 is indicated by a broken line "g".<br>
[0016] The device 10 can be terminated at the second end 18, or if desired various kind of .auxiliary attachment, extensions, stops and handles, will be connected to the second end 18. However, in the Figure 1, a handle 22 is secured to the second end 18. When the device 10 is composed by a ridged material, the preferred total length from the top end 5 of the first end section to the second end 18 of the concaved section is less than less than 60mm.<br>
[0017] The distance from the broken line "h" at the end 15 to the broken line "g" at the second end 18 is 25 mm to 40 mm, inclusive. This distance represents an entire length of the anal sphincter. The length of the middle section 20 is 13mm to 19mm inclusive. This distance represents the length of the internal hemorrhoid area. The length of the concaved section 17 is 13mm to 19mm inclusive. This distance represents the length of the pecten. The diameters of the end 15 and the first end 16 and the second end 18 are almost equal. Typically, these diameters will be less than 19mm. hi the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the optimum diameters would be less than 12mm. [0018] The cylindrical surface 14 of the first end section 11 can be replaced various shaped surfaces, since this first end section 11 is outside the territory of the anal sphincter, the lateral pressure of the sphincter will not influence the first end section 11.<br>
[0019] Also, the cylindrical surface 21 of the middle section 20 can be replaced by various shaped surfaces. If such a various shaped surfaces are used, then the diametric difference between the end 15 of the middle section 20 and the first end 16 of the concaved section 17 is ±15%. When the<br><br>
 [0025] FIGURE 3 shows first alternative embodiment of the hemorrhoid treatment device 700 of<br>
the present invention. The device 700 has a first end section 711, a middle section 720 and a<br>
concaved section 717. The first end section 711 has a bulbous upper portion 707, a narrowing<br>
tapered surface 714 extending from the upper portion 707 to the end 715. The end 715 is indicated<br>
by broken line "h". The middle section 720 is located between the end 15 and a first end 716 of the<br>
concaved section 717.<br>
[0026] The middle section 720 has a convex surface 721 extending from the end 715 to the first end<br>
716, and the concaved section 717 has a concavity extending from the first end 716 to the second<br>
end 718. The second end 71S is indicated by broken line "g". The device 700 can be terminated at<br>
the end 718, or various kind of auxiliary attachment, such as stops and handles, can be connected<br>
to the second end 718. For example, in FIGURE 3, ahandle 722 is attached to the second end 718.<br>
The length from the top end 705 of the first end section 711 to the second end 718 of the concaved<br>
section 717 is less than 100 mm.<br>
[0027] The length from the broken line "h" to the broken line "g" is 25 mm to 40 mm inclusive. This<br>
length represents the entire length of the human anal canal. The length of the middle section 720 is<br>
13 mm to 19 mm inclusive. This length represents the length of the internal hemorrhoid area. The<br>
length of the concaved section 717 is 13mm to 19mm inclusive. This length represents the length<br>
ofthepecten.<br>
[0028] The diametric difference between the end 715 of the middle section 720 and the first end 716<br>
of the concaved section 717 is ±15 %. As a result, the convex surface of the middle section 720 will<br>
not yield to significant thrust force caused by the lateral pressure of the internal hemorrhoid area and<br>
will not Interrupt or interfere with the gripping ability of the pecten to the concaved section 717. The<br>
diameter of the narrowest portion of the concaved section 717 is no more than the diameter of the<br>
end 715 of the middle section 720.<br>
[0029] The diameters of the first end 716 and the second end 718 of the concaved section 717 are<br>
almost equal. This diameter can be less than 19 mm.<br>
[0030] In the alternative embodiment shown in FIGURE 3, the end section 711 can be replaced by<br>
various shapes of surfaces extending from the bulbous top portion 707 to the end 715 of the middle<br>
section 720.<br>
[0031] FIGURE 4 shows a second alternative embodiment of the hemorrhoid treatment device 900<br>
of the present invention. The device 900 has a first end section 911, a middle section 920 and a<br>
concaved section 917. The first end section 911 has a bulbous upper portion 907. A narrowing<br><br><br><br><br><br>
