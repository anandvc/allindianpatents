THE FOLLOWING SPECIFICATION PARTICULARLY DESCRIBES THE INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFORMED.<br>
1<br><br>
The purpose of mis mvention is:<br>
-	new selenohydroxy-acid compounds and their derivatives;<br>
-	their process for the preparation;<br>
-	their use as precursors of L(+)-selenomethionme and/or source of selenium in human or animal nutrition, in cosmetics and pharmaceutics;<br>
-	and nutritional, cosmetic and pharmaceutical compositions containing them.<br>
State of the art<br>
This invention relates to new selenohydroxy-acids (SHA) and their derivatives, their preparations and applications in nutrition, cosmetics and pharmaceutics. More particularly, this invention relates to the synthesis of 2-hydroxy-4-methylselenobutyric acid, its salts and esters and amides derived from 2-hydroxy-4-methylselenobutyric acid as selenomethionine precursors and particularly L(+)-selenomethionine precursors according to a biomimetic approach using enzymes with animal or human origin.<br>
Selenium is a micro-nutrient essential particularly for Man and mammals (Wendel, A.; Phosphorus, Sulfur Silicon Relat Elem.; 1992; 67, 1-4, 405-415). It participates in the biosynthesis of selenoproteins such as Glutathion peroxydase, as well as Thioredoxine reductase and Selenoprotein, in the form of L(+)-selenocysteine or L(+)-selenomethionine {Mutter, S. et al; Arch. Microbiol, 1997; 168; 421). According to FDA-KDAs 10th edition 1989 {Selenium: its molecular biology and role in human health; Hatfield, D.L. Eds; 2003; Kluwer Acad. Publishers; second edition; 299-31), Man's daily needs of selenium vary from 10-30 ug for a child to 40-70 ug for an adolescent-adult, these rates being higher particularly for women during pregnancy (65 ug/day) and during breast feeding (75 ug/day). The additional amount of L(+)-selenomethionine (2,7 umoles of selenium equivalent) for breast feeding women significantly increases the concentration of selenium in their milk (McGuire, M.K. et al; Am. J. Clin. Nutr.; 1993; 58; 5; 649).<br>
Man is auxotrophic for L(+)-selenomethionine, which means that he is incapable of synthesising it. Therefore, the only way to obtain it is through food. Ideally, selenium should be absorbed in its natural form, in other words in organic form. Nevertheless, several forms of<br>
selenium may be used as a food complement; inorganic selenium for example such as sodium selenite; and organic selenium for example such as L(+)-selenomethionine. Knowing that more than 80% of total organic selenium in plants (particularly wheat, corn and soya) consists of ^^selenomethionine, this amino acid is the most appropriate and least toxic form of<br>
2.<br><br>
selenium, and is better than sodium selenite as an animal or human food complement (Schrauzer, G.N.; J.Am.Coll. Nutrit; 2001; 20; 1; 1-4). ^^selenomethionine has better bioavailability and is much better tolerated than sodium selenite (Mony, MC et al; J. of Trace Elem. Exp. Med.; 2000; 13; 367-380).<br>
L(+)-selenomethionine has anti-oxidative properties due to the presence of selenium in its molecular structure (Tapiero H et al; Biomed. Pharmacother.; 2003; 57; 3-4; 134-144). It has been shown that ^^selenomethionine very effectively traps peroxynitrite, an extremely toxic metabohte generated in all inflammatory situations and for which the deleterious action causes cell death (Assman, A. et al; Arch. Biochem. Biophys.; 1998; 349; 201-203).<br>
A selenium food complement proved to be very beneficial in many situations (nutritional deficiency, diseases, exposure to radiation, etc.). This is particularly true for children suffering from genetic diseases such as phenylcetonuria or hyperphenylalaninemia, since these children have low protein diets (Reilly, C. et al; Am. J. Clin. Nutr.; 1990; 52; 150-165). Selenium in organic form such as L(+)-selenomethionine associated with vitamins has protective effects with regard to UV radiation in man (La Ruche et al; Photodermtol Photoimmunol. Photomed.; 1991; 8; 6; 232-235). L(+)-selenomethionine protects against the deleterious biological effects of high energy ionising radiation (Kennedy, AR et al; Free Rad. Biol Med.; 2004; 36; 2; 259-266).<br>
Furthermore, several organoselenium derivatives have been effective in the prevention of some types of cancer in Man. In this context, it has been shown that L(+)-selenomethionine causes activation of a DNA repair system, mediated by the p53 tumour suppressor, thus reducing the accumulation of mutations in somatic cells (Seo, YR et al; PNAS; 2002, 89; 22;14548). It has been shown that a complement of up to 200ug/Se/day of L(+)-selenomethionine in Man very significantly reduces the incidence of cancers such as cancer of the lungs, colorectal cancer and prostate cancer. Seven out of a total of eight clinical tests to evaluate the effect of selenium on the incidence of cancer gave positive results (Whanger, PD; Br. J. Nutr.; 2004; 91,1, 11-28). This confirms the many studies carried out on animals.<br>
Some rare selenohydroxy-acid derivatives have already been described as synthetic intermediates in the preparation of organic derivatives. These are essentially arylselenohydroxy-acid derivatives. For example, this is the case for the methyl ester of 2-hydroxy-4-phenylselenobutyric acid (J.-G. Boiteau, Organic Letters, 2001, 3 (17), 1737 -2740). Furthermore, a selenoxide of 2-hydroxy-4-methylselenobutyric acid has been suggested as an intermediate of oxydative degradation of L(+)-selenomethionine (Gammelgaard, B. etal; Talenta; 2003; 59; 1165-1171).<br>
Surprisingly, 2-hydroxy-4-methylselenobutyric acid itself, its salts and its ester and amide derivatives, are not known. Unlike arylselenohydroxy acid derivatives, these latter compounds may represent potential precursors of selenomethionine. After an enzymatic or<br>
3<br><br>
chemical transformation, 2-hydroxy-4-methylselenobutyric acid, its salts and its ester and amide derivatives, after eventual hydrolysis, can lead to selenomethionine according to the following transformation:<br><br><br><br>
Furthermore, 2-hydroxy-4-methylsulfobutyric acid is known as a methionine precursor for food (WO 9636598; 21.11.1996).<br>
One of the purposes of this invention is to create new compounds containing selenium that, after being administered to man or to animal, may be precursors of selenomethionine, and therefore sources of selenium for the organism. Compounds according to the invention can penetrate inside tissues or cells to be biotransformed into selenomethionine or derivatives so that selenium can be incorporated into proteins of the organism.<br>
These purposes are achieved through this invention that is based on the design of new selenohydroxy-acid derivatives and their esters and amides, which are biotransformed by enzymes present in animal or human cells to generate selenomethionine. This has been exemplified by the Applicant. Description of the invention<br>
Therefore, the purpose of this invention is to:<br>
1)	solve the new technical problem that consists of supplying new selenohydroxy-acids, ester and amide derivatives, as selenomethionine precursors, thus forming the active constituents of nutritional, cosmetic and pharmaceutical compositions;<br>
2)	solve this new technical problem using a solution that includes a method for preparation of these new derivatives.<br>
The technical problems mentioned above are solved simultaneously by this invention for the first time, in a very easy and economic manner, the method for preparation of the said new derivatives being high-yielding and very simple to implement.<br>

According to one advantageous embodiment of the process according to the invention: the nucleophile selenium reagent is:<br>
*	either a methyl selenolate salt which is possibly generated in situ:<br>
*	or produced from selenium metal Se(0) and an alkyl salt in an aprotic solvent, for example such as tetrahydrofurane (THF);<br>
*	or from a dimethyl diselenide (CH3Se)2 in the presence of a reducing agent, for example such as sodium borohydride in an aprotic solvent for example such as THF;<br>
*	or a selenocyanate salt such as potassium selenocyanate which may be generated in situ:<br>
*	or from selenium metal Se(0) and an a cyanide salt for example such as potassium cyanide,<br>
*	or added to the medium as such,<br>
*	or a selenide or diselenide salt for example such as sodium or lithium selenide or diselenide,<br>
*	or a selenosulfate salt for example such as sodium selenosulfate.<br>
An aprotic polar solvent is used, for example such as THF.<br>
The reducing agent mat is made to react with the compound of formula (Ilia) or (Illb) is preferably an alkaline borohydride.<br>
The subsequent reactions leading to different compounds of formula (I), either acidification, esterification, amidification, oxidation, salification, are done under conditions known to those skilled in the art.<br>
In particular, the purpose of the invention is a process as defined above, characterized in that the starting point is 2-hydroxybutyrolactone.<br>
10<br><br>
2-R]-butyrolactone is obtained by esterification of 2-hydroxybutyrolactone under conditions known to those skilled in the art.<br>
Intermediate compounds of formulae (III), (Ilia) and (nib) as defined above are new and consequently are included in the invention.<br>
Another purpose of the invention is a process for the preparation of L-(+)-selenomethionine starting from 2-hydroxy-4-methylseleno-butyric acid of formula (I) or one of its alkaline salts of formula (la) described in the above method. Through this aspect, the Applicant shows the capacity of compounds of general formula (I) to act as precursors of L-(+)-selenomethionine, either directly or after enzymatic or non-enzymatic hydrolysis.<br>
The innovative nature of this new process consists in a combination of a synthetic chemical approach in the first part of the method with a biomimetic approach that uses enzymes when applicable, particularly mammal enzymes in the second part of this method.<br>
The process includes the following essential steps:<br>
1) oxidation of 2-hydroxy-4-methylseleno-butyric acid of formula (I) or one of its alkaline salts of formula (la) described in the above method, either by an oxydo-reductase type enzyme, for example such as an alcohol dehydrogenase, or by a chemical method based on action by an appropriate oxidation reagent to obtain the corresponding cetoacid of formula (V);<br><br>
2) transamination of the compound of formula (V) either by an enzymatic method using a transaminase such as an ammo-acid transaminase, or chemically under reducing animation conditions to obtain L-(+)-selenomethionine.<br>
These two enzymatic reactions may be performed either separately with the possibility of isolating the intermediate compound of formula (V), or « one-pot» to obtain L-(+)-selenomethionine directly. The oxydo-reductase type enzyme may particularly be an alcohol dehydrogenase. In particular, the transaminase is an amino-acid transaminase. Particularly interesting for this purpose, transamination of 2-ceto-4-methylselenobutyric acid obtained by degradation of L(+)-selenomethionine, was described by C. Blarzino et al. using a purified glutamine transaminase starting from beef liver (Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int.; 1994; 32,1, 79-86).<br>
Chemical oxidation of 2-hydroxy-4-methylselenobutyric acid is done particularly using a sulfonium dimethyl chloride type reagent [(Me)2ClS+, CI"] and transamination of the compound of formula (V) is done chemically under reducing amination conditions well known to those skilled in the art.<br>
Another purpose of the invention is the use of compounds of general formula I and their salts as a source of selenomethionine, particularly L(+) selenomethionine, and/or selenium in man or animal.<br>
II<br><br>
ID particular, this means use of the said compounds of general formula (I) as:<br>
-	L-(+)-selenomethionine precursors either directly or after in vivo enzymatic hydrolysis;<br>
-	selenium sources, in order to compensate for partial or total lack of selenium;<br>
-	food complements or additives for making nutritional compositions for human or animal food (more particularly cattle, sheep, pigs, horses, dogs and cats and poultry);<br>
-	components for making cosmetic compositions;<br>
-	active constituents for making pharmaceutical compositions adapted particularly to the prevention and treatment of all physiopathological conditions, in which a complement of L-(+)-selenomethionine, either alone or in co-administration with an anticancer agent, has been shown to be beneficial, and including particularly:<br><br>
*	prevention and treatment of cancers such as prostate, lungs, colon and skin cancers;<br>
*	prevention and treatment of either UV or ionising radiation effects;<br>
*	prevention and treatment of pathologies related to the overproduction of peroxynitrite, a very toxic metabolite of nitric oxide NO, as is the case particularly in inflammatory pathologies;<br>
and also as:<br>
-	additives to a pharmaceutical active constituent to modulate its toxicity and/or its<br>
therapeutic efficiency, for example in the use of particularly toxic anti-tumour agents.<br>
A particular purpose of the invention is the use as described above, characterized in that the compounds of general formula (I) or their salts are presented in the form of foods complements or additives for human or animal food.<br>
Another purpose of the invention is the use of compounds of general formula (T) and their phaimaceutically acceptable salts as active constituents for manufacturing pharmaceutical compositions, or the use of compounds of general formula (I) and their salts as components for the manufacture of cosmetics compositions, characterized in that the compounds used belong to the general formula (T) corresponding to the general formula (I) in which n = 0,1 or 2,<br>

R3 = ceramide 1, ceramide 2, ceramide 3, ceramide 4, ceramide S, ceramide 6a and 6b, S-cysteinyl, or S-glutathionyl, or<br>

5.6 mL (9 mmol) of a solution of methyllithium in ether (1.6 M) is added dropwise to a suspension of 645 mg (8.2 mmol) of selenium in 30 mL of anhydrous THF, at 0°C. The<br>
suspension firstly becomes dark brown then reddish and at the end of the addition a clear, homogenous and colourless solution is obtained. After stirring for 15 min. at 0°C, 0.77 mL (1.0 g, 9.8 mmol) of S-(-)-alpha-hydroxybutyrolactone is added. A white precipitate is quickly formed. Stirring is continued at 0°C for 15 minutes, and the reaction mix is then allowed to warm up to ambient temperature. After 24h at ambient temperature and 24h at 40°C, the heterogeneous mix is cooled to 5°C. The precipitate is filtered and then washed with 4x25 mL of diethylic ether. 1.05 g of a white powder is obtained. This compound is dissolved in 20 mL of NaOH, and the solution obtained is washed with 4x25 mL of diethylic ether. The aqueous phase is then acidified with concentrated HC1 to a pH = 1, and is then extracted with 10x25 mL of dichloromethane.
