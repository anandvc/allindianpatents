PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOUNDS<br>
This invention relates to pyrazole compounds that inhibit or modulate the activity of cyclin dependent kinases (CDK) and glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3), to the use of the compounds in the treatment or prophylaxis of disease states or conditions mediated by cyclin dependent kinases and glycogen synthase kinase-3, and to novel compounds having cyclin dependent kinase or glycogen synthase kinase-3 inhibitory or modulating activity. Also provided are pharmaceutical compositions containing the compounds and novel chemical intermediates.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Protein kinases constitute a large family of structurally related enzymes that are responsible for the control of a wide variety of signal transduction processes within the cell (Hardie, G. and Hanks, S. (1995) The Protein Kinase Facts Book. I and II, Academic Press, San Diego, CA). The kinases may be categorized into families by the substrates they phosphorylate (e.g., protein-tyrosine, protein-serine/threonine, lipids, etc.). Sequence motifs have been identified that generally correspond to each of these kinase families (e.g.. Hanks, S.K., Hunter, T., FASEBJ., 9:576-596 (1995); Knighton, et al.. Science, 253:407-414 (1991); Hiles, etal.. Ceil, 70:419-429 (1992); Kunz, et al.. Cell, 73:585-596 (1993); Garcia-Bustos, et at., EMBOJ., 13:2352-2361 (1994)).<br>
Protein kinases may be characterized by their regulation mechanisms. These mechanisms include, for example, autophosphorylation, transphosphorylation by other kinases, protein-protein interactions, protein-lipid interactions, and protein-polynucleotide interactions. An individual protein kinase may be regulated by more than one mechanism.<br>
Kinases regulate many different cell processes including, but not limited to, proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, motility, transcription, translation and other signalling processes, by adding phosphate groups to target proteins. These phosphorylation events act as molecular on/off switches that can modulate or regulate the target protein biological function. Phosphorylation of target proteins occurs in response to a variety of extracellular signals (hormones,<br><br>
neurotransmitters, growth and differentiation factors, etc.), cell cycle events, environmental or nutritional stresses, etc. The appropriate protein kinase functions in signalling pathways to activate or inactivate (either directly or indirectly), for example, a metabolic enzyme, regulatory protein, receptor, cytoskeletal protein, ion channel or pump, or transcription factor. Uncontrolled signalling due to defective control of protein phosphorylation has been implicated in a number of diseases, including, for example, inflammation, cancer, allergy/asthma, disease and conditions of the immune system, disease and conditions of the central nervous system, and angiogenesis.<br>
The process of eukaryotic cell division may be broadly divided into a series of sequential phases termed Gl, S, G2 and M. Correct progression through the various phases of the cell cycle has been shown to be critically dependent upon the spatial and temporal regulation of a family of proteins known as cyclin dependent kinases (CDKs) and a diverse set of their cognate protein partners termed cyclins. CDKs are cdc2 (also known as CDKl) homologous serine-threonine kinase proteins that are able to utilise ATP as a substrate in the phosphorylation of diverse polypeptides in a sequence dependent context. Cyclins are a family of proteins characterised by a homology region, containing approximately 100 amino acids, termed the "cyclin box" which is used in binding to, and defining selectivity for, specific CDK partner proteins.<br>
Modulation of the expression levels, degradation rates, and activation levels of various CDKs and cyclins throughout the cell cycle leads to the cyclical formation of a series of CDK/cyclin complexes, in which the CDKs are enzymatically active. The formation of these complexes controls passage through discrete cell cycle checkpoints and thereby enables the process of cell division to continue. Failure to satisfy the pre-requisite biochemical criteria at a given cell cycle checkpoint, i.e. failure to form a required CDK/cyclin complex, can lead to cell cycle arrest and/or cellular apoptosis. Aberrant cellular proliferation, as manifested in cancer, can often be attributed to loss of correct cell cycle control. Inhibition of CDK enzymatic activity therefore provides a means by which abnormally dividing cells can have their division arrested and/or be killed. The diversity of CDKs, and CDK<br>
^i&gt;<br><br>
complexes, and their critical roles in mediating the cell cycle, provides a broad spectrum of potential therapeutic targets selected on the basis of a defined biochemical rationale.<br>
Progression from the Gl phase to the S phase of the cell cycle is primarily regulated by CDK2, CDK3, CDK4 and CDK6 via association with members of the D and E type cyclins. The D-type cyclins appear instrumental in enabling passage beyond the Gl restriction point, where as the CDK2/cyclin E complex is key to the transition from the Gl to S phase. Subsequent progression through S phase and entry into G2 is thought to require the CDK2/cyclin A complex. Both mitosis, and the G2 to M phase transition which triggers it, are regulated by complexes of CDKl and the A and B type cyclins.<br>
During Gl phase Retinoblastoma protein (Rb), and related pocket proteins such as pi30, are substrates for CDK(2, 4, &amp; 6)/cyclin complexes.   Progression through Gl is in part facilitated by hyperphosphorylation, and thus inactivation, of Rb and pi 30 by the CDK(4/6)/cyclin-D complexes. Hyperphosphorylation of Rb and pi 30 causes the release of transcription factors, such as E2F, and thus the expression of genes necessary for progression through Gl and for entry into S-phase, such as the gene for cyclin E. Expression of cyclin E facilitates formation of the CDK2/cyciin E complex which amplifies, or maintains, E2F levels via further phosphorylation of Rb.   The CDK2/cyclin E complex also phosphorylates other proteins necessary for DNA replication, such as NPAT, which has been implicated in histone biosynthesis. Gl progression and the Gl/S transition are also regulated via the mitogen stimulated Myc pathway, which feeds into the CDK2/cyclin E pathway. CDK2 is also connected to the p53 mediated DNA damage response pathway via p53 regulation of p21 levels. p21 is a protein inhibitor of CDK2/cyclin E and is thus capable of blocking, or delaying, the Gl/S transition. The CDK2/cyclin E complex may thus represent a point at which biochemical stimuli from the Rb, Myc and p53 pathways are to some degree integrated. CDK2 and/or the CDK2/cyclin E complex therefore represent good targets for therapeutics designed at arresting, or recovering control of, the cell cycle in aberrantly dividing cells.<br>
a^<br><br>
The exact role of CDK3 in the cell cycle is not clear. As yet no cognate cyclin partner has been identified, but a dominant negative form of CDK3 delayed cells in Gl, thereby suggesting that CDK3 has a role in regulating the Gl/S transition.<br>
Although most CDKs have been implicated in regulation of the cell cycle there is evidence that certain members of the CDK family are involved in other biochemical processes. This is exemplified by CDKS which is necessary for correct neuronal development and which has also been implicated in the phosphorylation of several neuronal proteins such as Tau, NUDE-1, synapsinl, DARPP32 and the MunclS/SyntaxinlA complex. Neuronal CDKS is conventionally activated by binding to the p35/p39 proteins. CDKS activity can, however, be deregulated by the binding of p25, a truncated version of p35. Conversion of p3S to p25, and subsequent deregulation of CDKS activity, can be induced by ischemia, excitotoxicity, and p-amyloid peptide. Consequently p2S has been implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's, and is therefore of interest as a target for therapeutics directed against these diseases.<br>
CDK7 is a nuclear protein that has cdc2 CAK activity and binds to cyclin H. CDK7 has been identified as component of the TFIIH transcriptional complex which has RNA polymerase II C-terminal domain (CTD) activity. This has been associated with the regulation of HIV-1 transcription via a Tat-mediated biochemical pathway. CDKS binds cyclin C and has been implicated in the phosphorylation of the CTD of RNA polymerase II. Similarly the CDK9/cyclin-Tl complex (P-TEFb complex) has been implicated in elongation control of RNA polymerase II. PTEF-b is also required for activation of transcription of the HIV-1 genome by the viral transactivator Tat through its interaction with cyclin Tl. CDK7, CDK8, CDK9 and the P-TEFb complex are therefore potential targets for anti-viral therapeutics.<br>
At a molecular level mediation of CDK/cyclin complex activity requires a series of stimulatory and inhibitory phosphorylation, or dephosphorylation, events.   CDK phosphorylation is performed by a group of CDK activating kinases (CAKs) and/or kinases such as weel, Mytl and Mikl. Dephosphorylation is performed by phosphatases such as cdc2S(a &amp; c), pp2a, or KAP.<br>
4-*&gt;<br><br>
CDK/cyclin complex activity may be furtlier regulated by two families of endogenous cellular proteinaceous inhibitors: the Kip/Cip family, or the INK family. The INK proteins specifically bind CDK4 and CDK6. pi e'"""* (also known as MTSl) is a potential tumour suppressor gene that is mutated, or deleted, in a large number of primary cancers. The Kip/Cip family contains proteins such as p2iCipi,wan^ p27K,pi ^^^ p57Kip2  ^^ discussed previously p21 is induced by p53<br>
and is able to inactivate the CDK2/cyclin(E/A) and CDK4/cyclin(Dl/D2/D3) complexes.   Atypically low levels of p27 expression have been observed in breast, colon and prostate cancers. Conversely over expression of cyclin E in solid tumours has been shown to correlate with poor patient prognosis. Over expression of cyclin Dl has been associated with oesophageal, breast, squamous, and non-small cell lung carcinomas.<br>
The pivotal roles of CDKs, and their associated proteins, in co-ordinating and driving the cell cycle in proliferating cells have been outlined above. Some of the biochemical pathways in which CDKs play a key role have also been described. The development of monotherapies for the treatment of proliferative disorders, such as cancers, using therapeutics targeted generically at CDKs, or at specific CDKs, is therefore potentially highly desirable. CDK inhibitors could conceivably also be used to treat other conditions such as viral infections, autoimmune diseases and neuro-degenerative diseases, amongst others. CDK targeted therapeutics may also provide clinical benefits in the treatment of the previously described diseases when used in combination therapy with either existing, or new, therapeutic agents. CDK targeted anticancer therapies could potentially have advantages over many current antitumour agents as they would not directly interact with DNA and should therefore reduce the risk of secondary tumour development.<br>
Glycogen Synthase Kinase-3 (GSK3) is a serine-threonine kinase that occurs as two ubiquitously expressed isoforms in humans (GSK3a &amp; beta GSK3P). GSK3 has been implicated as having roles in embryonic development, protein synthesis, cell proliferation, cell differentiation, microtubule dynamics, cell motility and cellular apoptosis. As such GSK3 has been implicated in the progression of disease states such as diabetes, cancer, Alzheimer's disease, stroke, epilepsy, motor neuron<br>
^6<br><br>
disease and/or head trauma. Phylogenetically GSK3 is most closely related to the cyclin dependent kinases (CDKs).<br>
The consensus peptide substrate sequence recognised by GSK3 is (Ser/Thr)-X-X-X-(pSer/pThr), where X is any amino acid (at positions (n+1), (n+2), (n+3)) and pSer and pThr are phospho-serine and phospho-threonine respectively (n+4). GSK3 phosphorylates the first serine, or threonine, at position (n). Phospho-serine, or phospho-threonine, at the (n+4) position appear necessary for priming GSK3 to give maximal substrate turnover. Phosphorylation of GSK3a at Ser21, or GSK3P at Ser9, leads to inhibition of GSK3. Mutagenesis and peptide competition studies have led to the model that the phosphorylated N-terminus of GSK3 is able to compete with phospho-peptide substrate (S/TXXXpS/pT) via an autoinhibitory mechanism. There are also data suggesting that GSK3a and GSKP may be subtly regulated by phosphorylation of tyrosines 279 and 216 respectively. Mutation of these residues to a Phe caused a reduction in in vivo kinase activity. The X-ray crystallographic structure of GSK3p has helped to shed light on all aspects of GSK3 activation and regulation.<br>
GSK3 forms part of the mammalian insulin response pathway and is able to phosphorylate, and thereby inactivate, glycogen synthase. Upregulation of glycogen synthase activity, and thereby glycogen synthesis, through inhibition of GSK3, has thus been considered a potential means of combating type II, or non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM): a condition in which body tissues become resistant to insulin stimulation. The cellular insulin response in liver, adipose, or muscle tissues, is triggered by insulin binding to an extracellular insulin receptor. This causes the phosphorylation, and subsequent recruitment to the plasma membrane, of the insulin receptor substrate (IRS) proteins. Further phosphorylation of the IRS proteins initiates recruitment of phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K) to the plasma membrane where it is able to liberate the second messenger phosphatidylinosityl 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3). This facilitates co-localisation of 3-phosphoinositide-dedependent protein kinase 1 (PDKl) and protein kinase B (PKB or Akt) to the membrane, where PDKl activates PKB. PKB is able to phosphorylate, and thereby inhibit, GSK3a and/or GSKP through<br><br>
phosphorylation of Ser9, or ser21, respectively. The inhibition of GSK3 then triggers upregulation of glycogen synthase activity. Therapeutic agents able to inhibit GSK3 may thus be able to induce cellular responses akin to those seen on insulin stimulation.    A further in vivo substrate of GSK3 is the eukaryotic protein synthesis initiation factor 2B (eIF2B). eIF2B is inactivated via phosphorylation and is thus able to suppress protein biosynthesis. Inhibition of GSK3, e.g. by inactivation of the "mammalian target of rapamycin" protein (mTOR), can thus upregulate protein biosynthesis. Finally there is some evidence for regulation of GSK3 activity via the mitogen activated protein kinase (MARK) pathway through phosphorylation of GSK3 by kinases such as mitogen activated protein kinase activated protein kinase 1 (MAPKAP-Kl or RSK). These data suggest that GSK3 activity may be modulated by mitogenic, insulin and/or amino acid stimulii.<br>
It has also been shown that GSK3P is a key component in the vertebrate Wnt signalling pathway. This biochemical pathway has been shown to be critical for normal embryonic development and regulates cell proliferation in normal tissues. GSK3 becomes inhibited in response to Wnt stimulii. This can lead to the de-phosphorylation of GSK3 substrates such as Axin, the adenomatous polyposis coll (APC) gene product and p-catenin. Aberrant regulation of the Wnt pathway has been associated with many cancers. Mutations in APC, and/or P-catenin, are common in colorectal cancer and other tumours. P-catenin has also been shown to be of importance in cell adhesion. Thus GSK3 may also modulate cellular adhesion processes to some degree. Apart from the biochemical pathways already described there are also data implicating GSK3 in the regulation of cell division via phosphorylation of cyclin-Dl, in the phosphorylation of transcription factors such as c-Jun, CCAAT/enhancer binding protein a (C/EBPa), c-Myc and/or other substrates such as Nuclear Factor of Activated T-cells (MFATc), Heat Shock Factor-1 (HSF-1) and the c-AMP response element binding protein (CREB). GSK3 also appears to play a role, albeit tissue specific, in regulating cellular apoptosis. The role of GSK3 in modulating cellular apoptosis, via a pro-apoptotic mechanism, may be of particular relevance to medical conditions in which neuronal apoptosis can occur. Examples of these are head trauma, stroke, epilepsy, Alzheimer's and motor neuron diseases, progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration.<br><br>
and Pick's disease. In vitro it has been shown that GSK3 is able to hyper-phosphorylate the microtubule associated protein Tau. Hyperphosphorylation of Tau disrupts its normal binding to microtubules and may also lead to the formation of intra-cellular Tau filaments. It is believed that the progressive accumulation of these filaments leads to eventual neuronal dysfunction and degeneration. Inhbition of Tau phosphorylation, through inhibition of GSK3, may thus provide a means of limiting and/or preventing neurodegenerative effects.<br>

General Preferences and Definitions<br>
The following general preferences and definitions shall apply to each of the moieties X, Y, R1 R' to R'1and any sub-definition, sub-group or embodiment thereof, unless the context indicates otherwise.<br>
In this specification, references to formula (lb) include formulae (II), (III), (IV), (IVa), (Va), (Vb), (Via), (VIb) and sub-groups, examples or embodiments of formulae (lb), (II), (III), (IV), (IVa), (Va), (Vb), (Via), (VIb) unless the context indicates otherwise.<br>
Thus for example, references to inter alia therapeutic uses, pharmaceutical formulations and processes for making compounds, where they refer to formula<br>
j1/A<br><br>
(lb), are also to be taken as referring to formulae (II), (III), (IV), (1 Va), (Va), (Vb), (Via), (VIb) and sub-groups, examples or embodiments of formulae (lb), (11), (111), (IV), (IVa), (Va), (Vb), (Via) or (VIb).<br>
Similarly, where preferences, embodiments and examples are given for compounds of the formula (lb), they are also applicable to formulae (II), (III), (IV), (IVa), (Va), (Vb), (Via), (VIb) and sub-groups, examples or embodiments of formulae (lb), (II), (III), (IV), (IVa), (Va), (Vb), (Via), (VIb) unless the context requires otherwise.<br>
References to "carbocyclic" and "heterocyclic" groups as used herein shall, unless the context indicates otherwise, include both aromatic and non-aromatic ring systems. Thus, for example, the term "carbocyclic and heterocyclic groups" includes within its scope aromatic, non-aromatic, unsaturated, partially saturated and fully saturated carbocyclic and heterocyclic ring systems. In general, such groups may be monocyclic or bicyclic and may contain, for example, 3 to 12 ring members, more usually 5 to 10 ring members. Examples of monocyclic groups are groups containing 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 ring members, more usually 3 to 7, and preferably 5 or 6 ring members. Examples of bicyclic groups are those containing 8, 9, 10, II and 12 ring members, and more usually 9 or 10 ring members.<br>
The carbocyclic or heterocyclic groups can be aryl or heteroaryl groups having from 5 to 12 ring members, more usually from 5 to 10 ring members. The term "aryl" as used herein refers to a carbocyclic group having aromatic character and the term "heteroaryl" is used herein to denote a heterocyclic group having aromatic character. The terms "aryl" and "heteroaryl" embrace polycyclic (e.g. bicyclic) ring systems wherein one or more rings are non-aromatic, provided that at least one ring is aromatic. In such polycyclic systems, the group may be attached by the aromatic ring, or by a non-aromatic ring. The aryl or heteroaryl groups can be monocyclic or bicyclic groups and can be unsubstituted or substituted with one or more substituents, for example one or more groups R'° as defined herein.<br>
The term "non-aromatic group" embraces unsaturated ring systems without aromatic character, partially saturated and fully saturated carbocyclic and heterocyclic ring systems. The terms "unsaturated" and "partially saturated" refer<br>
l1fl<br><br>
to rings wherein tlie ring structure(s) contains atoms sharing more than one valence bond i.e. the ring contains at least one multiple bond e.g. a C=C, C=C or N=C bond. The term "fully saturated" refers to rings where there are no multiple bonds between ring atoms. Saturated carbocyclic groups include cycloalkyl groups as defined below. Partially saturated carbocyclic groups include cycloalkenyl groups as defined below, for example cyclopentenyl, cycloheptenyl and cyclooctenyl. A further example of a cycloalkenyl group is cyclohexenyl.<br>
Examples of heteroaryl groups are monocyclic and bicyclic groups containing from five to twelve ring members, and more usually from five to ten ring members. The heteroaryl group can be, for example, a five membered or six membered monocyclic ring or a bicyclic structure formed from fused five and six membered rings or two fused six membered rings or, by way of a further example, two fused five membered rings. Each ring may contain up to about four heteroatoms typically selected from nitrogen, sulphur and oxygen. Typically the heteroaryl ring will contain up to 4 heteroatoms, more typically up to 3 heteroatoms, more usually up to 2, for example a single heteroatom. In one embodiment, the heteroaryl ring contains at least one ring nitrogen atom. The nitrogen atoms in the heteroaryl rings can be basic, as in the case of an imidazole or pyridine, or essentially non-basic as in the case of an indole or pyrrole nitrogen. In general the number of basic nitrogen atoms present in the heteroaryl group, including any amino group substituents of the ring, will be less than five.<br>
Examples of five membered heteroaryl groups include but are not limited to pyrrole, furan, thiophene, imidazole, furazan, oxazole, oxadiazole, oxatriazole, isoxazole, thiazole, isothiazole, pyrazole, triazole and tetrazole groups.<br>

When sulphur is present, it may, where the nature of the adjacent atoms and groups permits, exist as -S-, -S(0)- or -S(0)2-.<br>
The heterocylic groups can contain, for example, cyclic ether moieties (e.g. as in tetrahydrofuran and dioxane), cyclic thioether moieties (e.g. as in tetrahydrothiophene and dithiane), cyclic amine moieties (e.g. as in pyrrolidine), cyclic amide moieties (e.g. as in pyrrolidone), cyclic thioamides, cyclic thioesters, cyclic ester moieties (e.g. as in butyrolactone), cyclic sulphones (e.g. as in sulpholane and sulpholene), cyclic sulphoxides, cyclic sulphonamldes and combinations thereof (e.g. morpholine and thiomorpholine and its S-oxide and S,S-dioxide). Further examples of heterocyclic groups are those containing a cyclic urea moiety (e.g. as in imidazolidin-2-one).<br>

Where the substituent group R'° comprises or includes a carbocyclic or heterocyclic group, the said carbocyclic or heterocyclic group may be unsubstituted or may itself be substituted with one or more further substituent groups R'°. In one sub-group of compounds of the formula (lb), such further substituent groups R"1 may include carbocyclic or heterocyclic groups, which are typically not themselves further substituted. In another sub-group of compounds of the formula (lb), the said further substituents do not include carbocyclic or heterocyclic groups but are otherwise selected from the groups listed above in the definition of R'".<br>
The substituents R'° may be selected such that they contain no more than 20 non-hydrogen atoms, for example, no more than 15 non-hydrogen atoms, e.g. no more than 12, or 11, or 10, or 9, or 8, or 7, or 6, or 5 non-hydrogen atoms.<br>
Where the carbocyclic and heterocyclic groups have a pair of substituents on adjacent ring atoms, the two substituents may be linked so as to form a cyclic group. Thus, two adjacent groups R'°, together with the carbon atoms or heteroatoms to which they are attached may form a 5-membered heteroaryl ring or a 5- or 6-membered non-aromatic carbocyclic or heterocyclic ring, wherein the said heteroaryl and heterocyclic groups contain up to 3 heteroatom ring members selected from N, O and S. For example, an adjacent pair of substituents on adjacent carbon atoms of a ring may be linked via one or more heteroatoms and optionally substituted alkylene groups to form a fused oxa-, dioxa-, aza-, diaza- or oxa-aza-cycloalkyl group.<br>
Examples of such linked substituent groups include:<br><br>

Where an alkylene chain is branched, it may have one or more methyl group side chains. Examples of alkylene groups include -CH2-, -CH2-CH2-, -CH2-CH2-CH2-, CH(CH3)-, -C(CH3)2-, -CH2-CH(CH3)-, -CH2-C(CH3)2- and -CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-.<br>
In one embodiment, Y is a bond.<br>
In another embodiment, Y is an alkylene chain.<br>
When Y is an alkylene chain, preferably it is unbranched and more particularly contains 1 or 2 carbon atoms, preferably 1 carbon atom. Thus preferred groups Y are -CH2- and -CH2-CH2-, a most preferred group being (CH2)-.<br>
Where Y is a branched chain, preferably it has no more than two methyl side chains. For example, it may have a single methyl side chain. In one embodiment, Y is a group -CH(Me)-.<br>
In one sub-group of compounds, Y is a bond, CH2, CH2CH2 or CH2CH(CH3).<br>

The various functional groups and substituents making up the compounds of the formula (lb) are typically chosen such that the molecular weight of the compound<br><br>
69-<br><br>
do<br><br>
of the formula (lb) does not exceed 1000. More usually, the molecular weight of the compound will be less than 750, for example less than 700, or less than 650, or less than 600, or less than 550. More preferably, the molecular weight is less than 525 and, for example, is 500 or less.<br>
Particular compounds of the invention are as illustrated in the examples below.<br>
Salts, Solvates. Tautomers. Isomers. N-Qxides, Esters. Prodrugs and Isotopes<br>
Unless otherwise specified, a reference to a particular compound also includes ionic, salt, solvate, and protected forms thereof, for example, as discussed below.<br>
Many compounds of the formula (lb) can exist in the form of salts, for example acid addition salts or, in certain cases salts of organic and inorganic bases such as carboxylate, sulphonate and phosphate salts. All such salts are within the scope of this invention, and references to compounds of the formula (lb) include the salt forms of the compounds. As in the preceding sections of this application, all references to formula (lb) should be taken to refer also to formulae (II), (111), (IV), (IVa), (Va), (Vb), (Via), (VIb) and sub-groups thereof unless the context indicates otherwise.<br>
Salt forms may be selected and prepared according to methods described in Pharmaceutical Salts: Properties, Selection, and Use, P. Heinrich Stahl (Editor), Camille G. Wermuth (Editor), ISBN: 3-90639-026-8, Hardcover, 388 pages, August 2002.<br>
Acid addition salts may be formed with a wide variety of acids, both inorganic and organic. Examples of acid addition salts include salts formed with an acid selected from the group consisting of acetic, 2,2-dichloroacetic, adipic, alginic, ascorbic (e.g. L-ascorbic), L-aspartic, benzenesulphonic, benzoic, 4-acetamidobenzoic, butanoic, (+) camphoric, camphor-sulphonic, (+)-(15)-camphor-10-sulphonic, capric, caproic, caprylic, cinnamic, citric, cyclamic, dodecylsulphuric, ethane-1,2-disulphonic, ethanesulphonic, 2-hydroxyethanesulphonic, formic, fumaric, galactaric, gentisic, glucoheptonic, D-gluconic, glucuronic (e.g. D-glucuronic), glutamic (e.g. L-glutamic), a-oxoglutaric, glycolic, hippuric, hydrobromic,<br>

One particular group of salts consists of salts formed from hydrochloric, hydriodic, phosphoric, nitric, sulphuric, citric, lactic, succinic, maleic, malic, isethionic, fumaric, benzenesulphonic, toluenesulphonic, methanesulphonic, ethanesulphonic, naphthalenesulphonic, valeric, acetic, propanoic, butanoic, malonic, glucuronic and lactobionic acids.<br>
One preferred group of salts consists of salts formed from hydrochloric, acetic, adipic, L-aspartic and DL-lactic acids.<br>
Particularly preferred salts are hydrochloride salts<br>
For example, if the compound is anionic, or has a functional group which may be anionic (e.g., -COOH may be -COO'), then a salt may be formed with a suitable cation. Examples of suitable inorganic cations include, but are not limited to, alkali metal ions such as Na"1 and K"1, alkaline earth cations such as Ca1"*" and Mg11, and other cations such as Ap"1. Examples of suitable organic cations include, but are not limited to, ammonium ion (i.e., NH4'1) and substituted ammonium ions (e.g., NHaR"1, NH2R21 NHRs"1, NR41). Examples of some suitable substituted ammonium ions are those derived from: ethylamine, diethylamine, dicyclohexylamine, triethylamine, butylamine, ethylenediamine, ethanolamine, diethanolamine, piperazine, benzylamine, phenylbenzylamine, choline, meglumine, and tromethamine, as well as amino acids, such as lysine and arginine. An example of a common quaternary ammonium ion is N(CH3)/.<br>
Where the compounds of the formula (lb) contain an amine function, these may form quaternary ammonium salts, for example by reaction with an alkylating agent<br>
17<br><br>
according to methods well known to the skilled person. Such quaternary ammonium compounds are within the scope of formula (lb).<br>
The salt forms of the compounds of the invention are typically pharmaceutically acceptable salts, and examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts are discussed in Berge etal., 1977, "Pharmaceutically Acceptable Salts," J. Pharm. Sci., Vol. 66, pp. 1-19. However, salts that are not pharmaceutically acceptable may also be prepared as intermediate forms which may then be converted into pharmaceutically acceptable salts.   Such non-pharmaceutically acceptable salts forms, which may be useful, for example, in the purification or separation of the compounds of the invention, also form part of the invention.<br>
Compounds of the formula (lb) containing an amine function may also form N-oxides. A reference herein to a compound of the formula (lb) that contains an amine function also includes the N-oxide.<br>
Where a compound contains several amine functions, one or more than one nitrogen atom may be oxidised to form an N-oxide. Particular examples of N-oxides are the N-oxides of a tertiary amine or a nitrogen atom of a nitrogen-containing heterocycle.<br>
N-Oxides can be formed by treatment of the corresponding amine with an oxidizing agent such as hydrogen peroxide or a per-acid (e.g. a peroxycarboxylic acid), see for example Advanced Organic Chemistry, by Jerry March, 4* Edition, Wiley Interscience, pages. More particularly, N-oxides can be made by the procedure of L. W. Deady (Syn. Comm. 1977, 7, 509-514) in which the amine compound is reacted with w-chloroperoxybenzoic acid (MCPBA), for example, in an inert solvent such as dichloromethane.<br>
Compounds of the formula (lb) may exist in a number of different geometric isomeric, and tautomeric forms and references to compounds of the formula (lb) include all such forms. For the avoidance of doubt, where a compound can exist in one of several geometric isomeric or tautomeric forms and only one is specifically described or shown, all others are nevertheless embraced by formula (lb).<br>
717:1<br><br>
For example, in compounds of the formula (lb) the pyrazole group may take either of the following two tautomeric forms A and B. For simplicity, the general formula (lb) illustrates form A but the formula is to be taken as embracing both tautomeric forms.<br><br><br><br><br>
B<br>
Other examples of tautomeric forms include, for example, keto-, enol-, and enolate-forms, as in, for example, the following tautomeric pairs: keto/enol (illustrated below), imine/enamine, amide/imino alcohol, amidine/amidine, nitroso/oxime, thioketone/enethiol, and nitro/aci-nitro.<br>

Where compounds of the formula (lb) contain one or more chiral centres, and can exist in the form of two or more optical isomers, references to compounds of the formula (lb) include all optical isomeric forms thereof (e.g. enantiomers, epimers and diastereoisomers), either as individual optical isomers, or mixtures (e.g. racemic mixtures) or two or more optical isomers, unless the context requires otherwise.<br>
The optical isomers may be characterised and identified by their optical activity (i.e. as + and - isomers, or J and / isomers) or they may be characterised in terms of their absolute stereochemistry using the "R and S" nomenclature developed by Cahn, Ingold and Prelog, see Advanced Organic Chemistry by Jerry March, 4"' Edition, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, 1992, pages 109-114, and see also Cahn, Ingold &amp; Prelog, .4«gm. Chem. Int. Ed Engl, 1966, 5, 385-415.<br><br>

'"i<br><br>
Optical isomers can be separated by a number of techniques including chiral chromatography (chromatography on a chiral support) and such techniques are well known to the person skilled in the art.<br>
Where compounds of the formula (lb) exist as two or more optical isomeric forms, one enantiomer in a pair of enantiomers may exhibit advantages over the other enantiomer, for example, in terms of biological activity. Thus, in certain circumstances, it may be desirable to use as a therapeutic agent only one of a pair of enantiomers, or only one of a plurality of diastereoisomers. Accordingly, the invention provides compositions containing a compound of the formula (lb) having one or more chiral centres, wherein at least 55% (e.g. at least 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%), 90%) or 95%)) of the compound of the formula (lb) is present as a single optical isomer (e.g. enantiomer or diastereoisomer). In one general embodiment, 99% or more (e.g. substantially all) of the total amount of the compound of the formula (lb) may be present as a single optical isomer (e.g. enantiomer or diastereoisomer).<br>
The compounds of the invention include compounds with one or more isotopic substitutions, and a reference to a particular element includes within its scope all isotopes of the element. For example, a reference to hydrogen includes within its scope 'H, 1H (D), and 1H (T). Similarly, references to carbon and oxygen include within their scope respectively '1C, '1C and '"C and '1O and '1O.<br>
The isotopes may be radioactive or non-radioactive. In one embodiment of the invention, the compounds contain no radioactive isotopes. Such compounds are preferred for therapeutic use. In another embodiment, however, the compound may contain one or more radioisotopes. Compounds containing such radioisotopes may be useful in a diagnostic context.<br>
Esters such as carboxylic acid esters and acyloxy esters of the compounds of formula (lb) bearing a carboxylic acid group or a hydroxyl group are also embraced by Formula (lb). Examples of esters are compounds containing the group -C(=0)OR, wherein R is an ester substituent, for example, a Ci-? alkyl group, a C3.20 heterocyclyl group, or a C5.20 aryl group, preferably a C1.7 alkyl group. Particular<br>
i1l <br>
examples of ester groups include, but are not limited to, -C(=0)0CH3, -C(=0)OCH2CH3, -C(=0)OC(CH3)3, and -C(=0)OPh. Examples of acyloxy (reverse ester) groups are represented by -OC(=0)R, wherein R is an acyloxy substituent, for example, a C1.7 alkyl group, a C3.20 heterocyclyl group, or a C5_2o ary! group, preferably a C1.7 alkyl group. Particular examples of acyloxy groups include, but are not limited to, -0C(=0)CH3 (acetoxy), -OC(=0)CH2CH3, -OC(=0)C(CH3)3, -OC(=0)Ph, and -0C(=0)CH2Ph.<br>
Also encompassed by formula (lb) are any polymorphic forms of the compounds, solvates (e.g. hydrates), complexes (e.g. inclusion complexes or clathrates with compounds such as cyclodextrins, or complexes with metals) of the compounds, and pro-drugs of the compounds. By "prodrugs" is meant for example any compound that is converted in vivo into a biologically active compound of the formula (lb).<br>
For example, some prodrugs are esters of the active compound (e.g., a physiologically acceptable metabolically labile ester). During metabolism, the ester group (-C(=0)OR) is cleaved to yield the active drug. Such esters may be formed by esterification, for example, of any of the carboxylic acid groups (-C(=0)OH) in the parent compound, with, where appropriate, prior protection of any other reactive groups present in the parent compound, followed by deprotection if required.<br>
Examples of such metabolically labile esters include those of the formula -<br>
C(=0)OR wherein R is:<br>
Ci.yalkyl<br>
(e.g., -Me, -Et, -nPr, -iPr, -nBu, -sBu, -iBu, -tBu);<br>
C 1.7am inoalkyi<br>
(e.g., aminoethyl; 2-(N,N-diethylamino)ethyl; 2-(4-morpholino)ethyl); and<br>
acyloxy-Ci-yalkyl<br>
(e.g., acyloxymethyl;<br>
acyloxyethyl;<br>
pivaloyloxymethyl;<br>
acetoxymethyl;<br>
1-acetoxyethyl;<br><br>
1 -(1 -methoxy-1 -methyl)ethyl-carbonxyloxyethyl;<br>
l-(benzoyloxy)ethyl; isopropoxy-carbonyloxymethyl;<br>
1 -isopropoxy-carbonyloxyethyl; cyclohexyl-carbonyloxymethyl;<br>
1 -cyclohexyl-carbonyloxyethyl;<br>
eye lohexy loxy-carbony loxymethy 1;<br>
1-cyclohexyloxy-earbonyloxyethyl;<br>

(4-tetrahydropyranyl)carbonyloxymethy 1; and<br>
1 -(4-tetrahydropyranyl)carbonyloxyethy 1).<br>
Also, some prodrugs are activated enzymatically to yield the active compound, or a compound which, upon further chemical reaction, yields the active compound (for example, as in ADEPT, GDEPT, LIDEPT, etc.). For example, the prodrug may be a sugar derivative or other glycoside conjugate, or may be an amino acid ester derivative.<br>
Biological Activity<br>
The compounds of the formulae (lb), (II), (III), (IV), (IVa), (Va), (Vb), (Via), (Vlb) and sub-groups thereof are inhibitors of cyclin dependent kinases, and in particular cyclin dependent kinases selected from CDKl, CDK2, CDK3, CDK4, CDK5 and CDK6.<br>
Preferred compounds are compounds that inhibit one or more CDK kinases selected from CDKl, CDK2, CDK4 and CDK5, for example CDKl and/or CDK2.<br>
The compounds of the invention are also considered to be inhibitors of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3).<br>
As a consequence of their activity in modulating or inhibiting CDK kinases and glycogen synthase kinase, they are expected to be useful in providing a means of arresting, or recovering control of, the cell cycle in abnormally dividing cells. It is therefore anticipated that the compounds will prove useful in treating or preventing proliferative disorders such as cancers. It is also envisaged that the compounds of<br><br>
the invention will be useful in treating conditions such as viral infections, type II or non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, autoimmune diseases, head trauma, stroke, epilepsy, neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, motor neurone disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration and Pick's disease for example. One sub-group of disease states and conditions where it is envisaged that the compounds of the invention will be useful consists of viral infections, autoimmune diseases and neurodegenerative diseases.<br>
CDKs play a role in the regulation of the cell cycle, apoptosis, transcription, differentiation and CNS function. Therefore, CDK inhibitors could be useful in the treatment of diseases in which there is a disorder of proliferation, apoptosis or differentiation such as cancer. In particular RB+ve tumours may be particularly sensitive to CDK inhibitors. RB-ve tumours may also be sensitive to CDK inhibitors.<br>
Examples of cancers which may be inhibited include, but are not limited to, a carcinoma, for example a carcinoma of the bladder, breast, colon (e.g. colorectal carcinomas such as colon adenocarcinoma and colon adenoma), kidney, epidermis, liver, lung, for example adenocarcinoma, small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung carcinomas, oesophagus, gall bladder, ovary, pancreas e.g. exocrine pancreatic carcinoma, stomach, cervix, thyroid, prostate, or skin, for example squamous cell carcinoma; a hematopoietic tumour of lymphoid lineage, for example leukemia, acute lymphocytic leukemia, B-cell lymphoma, T-cell lymphoma, Hodgkin's lymphoma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, hairy cell lymphoma, or Burkett's lymphoma; a hematopoietic tumour of myeloid lineage, for example acute and chronic myelogenous leukemias, myelodysplastic syndrome, or promyelocytic leukemia; thyroid follicular cancer; a tumour of mesenchymal origin, for example fibrosarcoma or habdomyosarcoma, a tumour of the central or peripheral nervous system, for example astrocytoma, neuroblastoma, glioma or schwannoma; melanoma; seminoma; teratocarcinoma; osteosarcoma; xeroderma pigmentosum; keratoctanthoma; thyroid follicular cancer; or Kaposi's sarcoma.<br>
The cancers may be cancers which are sensitive to inhibition of any one or more cyclin dependent kinases selected from CDKl, CDK2, CDK3, CDK4, CDK5 and<br>
27'78'<br><br>
CDK6, for example, one or more CDK kinases selected from CDKl, CDK2, CDK4 and CDK5, e.g. CDKl and/or CDK2.<br>
Whether or not a particular cancer is one which is sensitive to inhibition by a cyclin dependent kinase may be determined by means of a cell growth assay as set out in Example 236 below or by a method as set out in the section headed "Methods of Diagnosis".<br>
CDKs are also known to play a role in apoptosis, proliferation, differentiation and transcription and therefore CDK inhibitors could also be useful in the treatment of the following diseases other than cancer; viral infections, for example herpes virus, pox virus, Epstein-Barr virus, Sindbis virus, adenovirus, HIV, HPV, HCV and HCMV; prevention of AIDS development in HIV-infected individuals; chronic inflammatory diseases, for example systemic lupus erythematosus, autoimmune mediated glomerulonephritis, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, inflammatory bowel disease, and autoimmune diabetes mellitus; cardiovascular diseases for example cardiac hypertrophy, restenosis, atherosclerosis; neurodegenerative disorders, for example Alzheimer's disease, AIDS-related dementia, Parkinson's disease, amyotropic lateral sclerosis, retinitis pigmentosa, spinal muscular atropy and cerebellar degeneration; glomerulonephritis; myelodysplastic syndromes, ischemic injury associated myocardial infarctions, stroke and reperfusion injury, arrhythmia, atherosclerosis, toxin-induced or alcohol related liver diseases, haematological diseases, for example, chronic anemia and aplastic anemia; degenerative diseases of the musculoskeletal system, for example, osteoporosis and arthritis, aspirin-senstive rhinosinusitis, cystic fibrosis, multiple sclerosis, kidney diseases and cancer pain.<br>
It has also been discovered that some cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors can be used in combination with other anticancer agents. For example, the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor flavopiridol has been used with other anticancer agents in combination therapy.<br>
Thus, in the pharmaceutical compositions, uses or methods of this invention for treating a disease or condition comprising abnormal cell growth, the disease or condition comprising abnormal cell growth in one embodiment is a cancer.<br>

One group of cancers includes human breast cancers (e.g. primary breast tumours, node-negative breast cancer, invasive duct adenocarcinomas of the breast, non-endometrioid breast cancers); and mantle cell lymphomas. In addition, other cancers are colorectal and endometrial cancers.<br>
Another sub-set of cancers includes breast cancer, ovarian cancer, colon cancer, prostate cancer, oesophageal cancer, squamous cancer and non-small cell lung carcinomas.<br>
The activity of the compounds of the invention as inhibitors of cyclin dependent kinases and glycogen synthase kinase-3 can be measured using the assays set forth in the examples below and the level of activity exhibited by a given compound can be defined in terms of the IC50 value. Preferred compounds of the present invention are compounds having an IC50 value of less than 1 micromole, more preferably less than 0.1 micromole.<br>
Methods for the Preparation of Compounds of the Invention<br>
Compounds of the formula (lb) and the various sub-groups thereof can be prepared in accordance with synthetic methods well known to the skilled person. Unless stated otherwise, R', R1, R1, Y, X and A are as hereinbefore defined.<br>
In this section, as in all the other sections of this application, references to formula (lb) should be taken to refer also to formulae (II), (III), (IV), (IVa), (Va), (Vb), (Via), (VIb) and sub-groups thereof unless the context indicates otherwise.<br>
Compounds of the formula (lb) wherein R'-A- forms an acyl group R'-CO- can be prepared by reacting a carboxylic acid of the formula R'-C02H or an activated derivative thereof with an appropriately substituted 4-amino-pyrazole as shown in Scheme 1.<br>

Scheme 1<br><br>
(XII)<br><br>
The starting material for the synthetic route shown in Scheme 1 is the 4-nitro-pyrazole-3-carboxylic acid (X) which can either be obtained commercially or can be prepared by nitration of the corresponding 4-unsubstituted pyrazole carboxy compound.<br>
The 4-nitro-pyrazole carboxylic acid (X), or a reactive derivative thereof, is reacted with the amine H2N-Y-R1 to give the 4-nitro-amide (XI). The coupling reaction between the carboxylic acid (X) and the amine is preferably carried out in the presence of a reagent of the type commonly used in the formation of peptide linkages. Examples of such reagents include 1,3-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) (Sheehan et al, J. Amer. ChemSoc. 1955,77, 1067), l-ethyl-3-(3'-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide (referred to herein either as EDC or EDAC but also known in the art as EDCI and WSCDI) (Sheehan et al, J. Org. Chem., 1961, 26, 2525), uronium-based coupling agents such as 0-(7-azabenzotriazol-l-yl)-A'iiV.A'1'.iV'-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HATU) and phosphonium-based coupling agents such as l-benzo-triazolyloxytris-(pyrrolidino)phosphonium hexafluorophosphate (PyBOP) (Castro et al, Tetrahedron Letters, 1990, 31, 205). Carbodiimide-based coupling agents are advantageously used in combination with l-hydroxy-7-azabenzotriazole (HOAt) (L. A. Carpino, J. Amer. Chem. Soc, 1993, 115. 4397) or 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt) (Konig et al, Chem. Ber., 103, 708,<br>
11<br><br>
2024-2034). Preferred coupling reagents include EDC (EDAC) and DCC in combination with HOAt or HOBt.<br>
The coupling reaction is typically carried out in a non-aqueous, non-protic solvent such as acetonitrile, dioxan, dimethylsulphoxide, dichloromethane, dimethylformamide or N-methylpyrrolidine, or in an aqueous solvent optionally together with one or more miscible co-solvents. The reaction can be carried out at room temperature or, where the reactants are less reactive (for example in the case of electron-poor anilines bearing electron withdrawing groups such as sulphonamide groups) at an appropriately elevated temperature. The reaction may be carried out in the presence of a non-interfering base, for example a tertiary amine such as triethylamine or A'ijV-diisopropylethylamine.<br>
As an alternative, a reactive derivative of the carboxylic acid, e.g. an anhydride or acid chloride, may be used. Reaction with a reactive derivative such an anhydride is typically accomplished by stirring the amine and anhydride at room temperature in the presence of a base such as pyridine.<br>
Amines of the formula H2N-Y-R1 can be obtained from commercial sources or can be prepared by any of a large number of standard synthetic methods well known those skilled in the art, see for example see Advanced Organic Chemistry by Jerry March, 4'*' Edition, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1992, and and Organic Syntheses, Volumes 1-8, John Wiley, edited by Jeremiah P. Freeman (ISBN: 0-471-31192-8), 1995, and see also the methods described in the experimental section below.<br>
The nitro-pyrazole amide (XI) is reduced to give the corresponding 4-amino-compound of the formula (XII). The reduction may be carried out by standard methods such as catalytic hydrogenation, for example in the presence of palladium on carbon in a polar solvent such as ethanol or dimethylformamide at room temperature. As an alternative, reduction may be effected using a reducing agent such as tin (II) chloride in ethanol, typically with heating, for example to the reflux temperature of the solvent.<br>
The 4-amino-pyrazole compound (XII) is then reacted with a carboxylic acid of the formula R'-C02H, or a reactive derivative thereof, using the methods and<br>
%f ST-<br><br>
conditions described above for the formation of the amide (XI), to give a compound of the formula (lb).<br>
Carboxyiic acids of the formula R'-C02H can be obtained commercially or can be synthesised according to methods well known to the skilled person, see for example Advanced Organic Chemistry and Organic Syntheses, the details for which are given above.<br>
Compounds of the formula (lb) in which X is a group R'-A-NR'*, where A is a bond, can be prepared from the 4-amino compounds of the formula (XII) by a number of methods. Reductive amination with an appropriately substituted aldehyde or ketone can be carried out in the presence of variety of reducing agents (see Advanced Organic Chemistry by Jerry March, 4"1 Edition, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1992, pp898-900. For example, reductive amination can be carried out in the presence of sodium triacetoxyborohydride in the presence of an aprotic solvent such as dichloromethane at or near ambient temperatures.<br>
Compounds in which X is a group R'-A-NR"* where A is a bond can also be prepared by the reaction of the 4-amino pyrazole compound (XII) with a compound of the formula R'-L in a nucleophillc displacement reaction where L is a leaving group such as a halogen.<br>
In an alternative synthetic route, compounds of the formula (lb) can be prepared by reaction of a compound of the formula (XIII) with a compound of the formula R1-Y-NH2. The reaction can be carried out using the amide coupling conditions described above.<br><br>
(XIII)<br>
Compounds of the formula (lb) where A is NH(C=0) can be prepared using standard methods for the synthesis of ureas. For example, such compounds can be prepared by reacting an aminopyrazole compound of the formula (XII) with a<br><br>
suitably substituted phenylisocyanate in a polar solvent such as DMF. The reaction is conveniently carried out at room temperature.<br>
Compounds of the formula (lb) where A is 0(C=0) can be made using standard methods for the synthesis of carbamates, for example by reaction of an amino pyrazole compound of the formula (XII) with a chloroformate derivative of the formula R'-0-C(0)-C1 under conditions well known to the skilled person.<br>
Once formed, one compound of the formula (lb) may be transformed into another compound of the formula (lb) using standard chemistry procedures well known in the art. For examples of functional group interconversions, see for example, Fiesers' Reagents for Organic Synthesis, Volumes 1-17, John Wiley, edited by Mary Fieser (ISBN: 0-471-58283-2), and Organic Syntheses, Volumes 1-8, John Wiley, edited by Jeremiah P. Freeman (ISBN: 0-471-31192-8), 1995.<br>
The starting materials for the synthetic routes shown in the Schemes above, e.g. the pyrazoles of formula (X), can either be obtained commercially or can be prepared by methods known to those skilled in the art. They can be obtained using known methods e.g. from ketones, such as in a process described in EP308020 (Merck), or the methods discussed by Schmidt in Helv. Chim. Acta., 1956, 39, 986-991 and Helv. Chim. Acta., 1958, 41, 306-309. Alternatively they can be obtained by conversion of a commercially available pyrazole, for example those containing halogen, nitro, ester, or amide functionalities, to pyrazoles containing the desired functionality by standard methods known to a person skilled in the art. For example, in 3-carboxy-4-nitropyrazole, the nitro group can be reduced to an amine by standard methods. 4-Nitro-pyrazole-3-carboxylic acid (XII) can either be obtained commercially or can be prepared by nitration of the corresponding 4-unsubstituted pyrazole carboxy compound, and pyrazoles containing a halogen, may be utilized in coupling reactions with tin or palladium chemistry.<br>
Protecting Groups<br>
In many of the reactions described above, it may be necessary to protect one or more groups to prevent reaction from taking place at an undesirable location on the molecule. Examples of protecting groups, and methods of protecting and<br><br>
deprotecting functional groups, can be found in Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis (T. Green and P. Wuts; 3rd Edition; Joiin Wiley and Sons, 1999).<br>
A hydroxy group may be protected, for example, as an ether (-OR) or an ester (-OC(=0)R), for example, as: a t-butyl ether; a tetrahydropyranyl (THP) ether; a benzyl, benzhydryl (diphenylmethyl), or trityl (triphenylmethyl) ether; a trimethylsilyl or t-butyldimethylsilyl ether; or an acetyl ester (-0C(=0)CH3, -OAc).<br>
An aldehyde or ketone group may be protected, for example, as an acetal (R-CH(0R)2) or ketal (R2C(OR)2), respectively, in which the carbonyl group (&gt;C=0) is converted to a diether (&gt;C(0R)2), by reaction with, for example, a primary alcohol. The aldehyde or ketone group is readily regenerated by hydrolysis using a large excess of water in the presence of acid.<br>
An amine group may be protected, for example, as an amide (-NRCO-R) or a urethane (-NRCO-OR), for example, as: a methyl amide (-NHCO-CH3); a benzyloxy amide (-NHCO-OCH2C6H5, -NH-Cbz orNH-Z); as a t-butoxy amide (-NHCO-OC(CH3)3, -NH-Boc); a 2-biphenyl-2-propoxy amide (-NHCO-OC(CH3)2C6H4C6H5, -NH-Bpoc), as a 9-fluQrenylmethoxy amide (-NH-Fmoc), as a 6-nitroveratryloxy amide (-NH-Nvoc), as a 2-trimethylsilylethyloxy amide {-NH-Teoc), as a 2,2,2-trichloroethyloxy amide (-NH-Troc), as an allyloxy amide (-NH-Alloc), or as a 2(-phenyisu!phonyl)ethyloxy amide (-NH-Psec).<br>
For example, in Scheme 1 above, when the moiety R1 in the amine HzN-Y-R1 contains a second amino group, such as a cyclic amino group (e.g. a piperidine or pyrrolidine group), the second amino group can be protected by means of a protecting group as hereinbefore defined, one preferred group being the tert-butyloxycarbonyl (Boc) group. Where no subsequent modification of the second amino group is required, the protecting group can be carried through the reaction sequence to give an N-protected form of a compound of the formula (lb) which can then be de-protected by standard methods (e.g. treatment with acid in the case of the Boc group) to give the compound of formula (lb).<br>
Other protecting groups for amines, such as cyclic amines and heterocyclic N-H groups, include toluenesulphonyl (tosyi) and methanesulphonyl (mesyl) groups.<br><br>
benzyl groups such as a/?flra-methoxybenzyl (PMB) group and tetrahydropyranyl (THP) groups.<br>
A carboxylic acid group may be protected as an ester for example, as: an C1.7 alkyl ester (e.g., a methyl ester; a t-butyl ester); a C1.7 haloalkyl ester (e.g., a C|_7 trihaloalkyl ester); a triCi.7 alkylsilyl-Ci.7alkyl ester; or a C5.20 aryl-Ci.? alkyl ester (e.g., a benzyl ester; a nitrobenzyl ester); or as an amide, for example, as a methyl amide. A thiol group may be protected, for example, as a thioether (-SR), for example, as: a benzyl thioether; an acetamidomethyl ether (-S-CH2NHC(=0)CH3).<br>
Isolation and purification of the compounds of the invention<br>
The compounds of the invention can be isolated and purified according to standard techniques well known to the person skilled in the art. One technique of particular usefulness in purifying the compounds is preparative liquid chromatography using mass spectrometry as a means of detecting the purified compounds emerging from the chromatography column.<br>
Preparative LC-MS is a standard and effective method used for the purification of small organic molecules such as the compounds described herein. The methods for the liquid chromatography (LC) and mass spectrometry (MS) can be varied to provide better separation of the crude materials and improved detection of the samples by MS. Optimisation of the preparative gradient LC method will involve varying columns, volatile eluents and modifiers, and gradients. Methods are well known in the art for optimising preparative LC-MS methods and then using them to purify compounds. Such methods are described in Rosentreter U, Huber U.; Optimal fraction collecting in preparative LC/MS; J Comb Chem.; 2004; 6(2), 159-64 and Leister W, Strauss K, Wisnoski D, Zhao Z, Lindsley C, Development of a custom high-throughput preparative liquid chromatography/mass spectrometer platform for the preparative purification and analytical analysis of compound libraries; J Comb Chem.; 2003; 5(3); 322-9.<br>
An example of such a system for purifying compounds via preparative LC-MS is described below in the Examples section of this application (under the heading "Mass Directed Purification LC-MS System"). However, it will be appreciated that<br><br>
alternative systems and methods to those described could be used. In particular, normal phase preparative LC based methods might be used in place of the reverse phase methods described here. Most preparative LC-MS systems utilise reverse phase LC and volatile acidic modifiers, since the approach is very effective for the purification of small molecules and because the eluents are compatible with positive ion electrospray mass spectrometry. Employing other chromatographic solutions e.g. normal phase LC, alternatively buffered mobile phase, basic modifiers etc as outlined in the analytical methods described below could alternatively be used to purify the compounds.<br>
Pharmaceutical Formulations<br>
While it is possible for the active compound to be administered alone, it is preferable to present it as a pharmaceutical composition (e.g. formulation) comprising at least one active compound of the invention together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, adjuvants, excipients, diluents, fillers, buffers, stabilisers, preservatives, lubricants, or other materials well known to those skilled in the art and optionally other therapeutic or prophylactic agents.<br>
Thus, the present invention further provides pharmaceutical compositions, as defined above, and methods of making a pharmaceutical composition comprising admixing at least one active compound, as defined above, together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, excipients, buffers, adjuvants, stabilizers, or other materials, as described herein.<br>
The term "pharmaceutically acceptable" as used herein pertains to compounds, materials, compositions, and/or dosage forms which are, within the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of a subject (e.g. human) without excessive toxicity, irritation, allergic response, or other problem or complication, commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio. Each carrier, excipient, etc. must also be "acceptable" in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation.<br>
Accordingly, in a further aspect, the invention provides compounds of the formula (la) and sub-groups thereof such as formulae (lb), (II), (III), (IV), (IVa), (Va), (Vb),<br><br>
(Via), (VIb) and sub-groups thereof as defined herein in the form of pharmaceutical compositions.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions can be in any form suitable for oral, parenteral, topical, intranasal, ophthalmic, otic, rectal, intra-vaginal, or transdermal administration. Where the compositions are intended for parenteral administration, they can be formulated for intravenous, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, subcutaneous administration or for direct delivery into a target organ or tissue by injection, infusion or other means of delivery.<br>
In one preferred embodiment of the invention, the pharmaceutical composition is in a form suitable for i.v. administration, for example by injection or infusion.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the pharmaceutical composition is in a form suitable for sub-cutaneous (s.c.) administration.<br>
Pharmaceutical dosage forms suitable for oral administration include tablets, capsules, caplets, pills, lozenges, syrups, solutions, powders, granules, elixirs and suspensions, sublingual tablets, wafers or patches and buccal patches.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions containing compounds of the formula (lb) can be formulated in accordance with known techniques, see for example. Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mack Publishing Company, Easton, PA, USA.<br>
Thus, tablet compositions can contain a unit dosage of active compound together with an inert diluent or carrier such as a sugar or sugar alcohol, eg; lactose, sucrose, sorbitol or mannitol; and/or a non-sugar derived diluent such as sodium carbonate, calcium phosphate, calcium carbonate, or a cellulose or derivative thereof such as methyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose, and starches such as corn starch. Tablets may also contain such standard ingredients as binding and granulating agents such as polyvinylpyrrolidone, disintegrants (e.g. swellable crosslinked polymers such as crosslinked carboxymethylcellulose), lubricating agents (e.g. stearates), preservatives (e.g. parabens), antioxidants (e.g. BHT), buffering agents (for example phosphate or citrate buffers), and effervescent agents<br>
1s1<br><br>
such as citrate1icarbonate mixtures. Such excipients are well known and do not need to be discussed in detail here.<br>
Capsule formulations may be of the hard gelatin or soft gelatin variety and can contain the active component in solid, semi-solid, or liquid form. Gelatin capsules can be formed from animal gelatin or synthetic or plant derived equivalents thereof<br>
The solid dosage forms (eg; tablets, capsules etc.) can be coated or un-coated, but typically have a coating, for example a protective film coating (e.g. a wax or varnish) or a release controlling coating. The coating (e.g. a Eudragit TM type polymer) can be designed to release the active component at a desired location within the gastro-intestinal tract. Thus, the coating can be selected so as to degrade under certain pH conditions within the gastrointestinal tract, thereby selectively release the compound in the stomach or in the ileum or duodenum.<br>
Instead of, or in addition to, a coating, the drug can be presented in a solid matrix comprising a release controlling agent, for example a release delaying agent which may be adapted to selectively release the compound under conditions of varying acidity or alkalinity in the gastrointestinal tract. Alternatively, the matrix material or release retarding coating can take the form of an erodible polymer (e.g. a maleic anhydride polymer) which is substantially continuously eroded as the dosage form passes through the gastrointestinal tract. As a further alternative, the active compound can be formulated in a delivery system that provides osmotic control of the release of the compound. Osmotic release and other delayed release or sustained release formulations may be prepared in accordance with methods well known to those skilled in the art.<br>
Compositions for topical use include ointments, creams, sprays, patches, gels, liquid drops and inserts (for example intraocular inserts). Such compositions can be formulated in accordance with known methods.<br>
Compositions for parenteral administration are typically presented as sterile aqueous or oily solutions or fine suspensions, or may be provided in finely divided sterile powder form for making up extemporaneously with sterile water for injection.<br>
MQry<br><br>
Examples of formulations for rectal or intra-vaginal administration include pessaries and suppositories which may be, for example, formed from a shaped moldable or waxy material containing the active compound.<br>
Compositions for administration by inhalation may take the form of inhalable powder compositions or liquid or powder sprays, and can be administrated in standard form using powder inhaler devices or aerosol dispensing devices. Such devices are well known. For administration by inhalation, the powdered formulations typically comprise the active compound together with an inert solid powdered diluent such as lactose.<br>
The compounds of the inventions will generally be presented in unit dosage form and, as such, will typically contain sufficient compound to provide a desired level of biological activity. For example, a formulation intended for oral administration may contain from 0.1 milligrams to 2 grams of active ingredient, more usually from 10 milligrams to 1 gram, for example, 50 milligrams to 500 milligrams.<br>
The active compound will be administered to a patient in need thereof (for example a human or animal patient) in an amount sufficient to achieve the desired therapeutic effect.<br>
Methods of Treatment<br>
It is envisaged that the compounds of the formula (lb) and sub-groups thereof such as formulae (II), (III), (IV), (IVa), (Va), (Vb), (Via), (VIb) and sub-groups thereof as defined herein will be useful in the prophylaxis or treatment of a range of disease states or conditions mediated by cyclin dependent kinases. Examples of such disease states and conditions are set out above.<br>
The compounds are generally administered to a subject in need of such administration, for example a human or animal patient, preferably a human.<br>
The compounds will typically be administered in amounts that are therapeutically or prophylactically useful and which generally are non-toxic. However, in certain situations (for example in the case of life threatening diseases), the benefits of administering a compound of the formula (lb) may outweigh the disadvantages of<br><br>
any toxic effects or side effects, in which case it may be considered desirable to administer compounds in amounts that are associated with a degree of toxicity.<br>
The compounds may be administered over a prolonged term to maintain beneficial therapeutic effects or may be administered for a short period only. Alternatively they may be administered in a pulsatile or continuous manner.<br>
A typical daily dose of the compound can be in the range from 100 picograms to 100 milligrams per kilogram of body weight, more typically 5 nanograms to 25 milligrams per kilogram of bodyweight, and more usually 10 nanograms to 15 milligrams per kilogram (e.g. 10 nanograms to 10 milligrams) per kilogram of bodyweight although higher or lower doses may be administered where required. Ultimately, the quantity of compound administered and the type of composition used will be commensurate with the nature of the disease or physiological condition being treated and will be at the discretion of the physician.<br>
The compounds of the formula (lb) can be administered as the sole therapeutic agent or they can be administered in combination therapy with one of more other compounds for treatment of a particular disease state, for example a neoplastic disease such as a cancer as hereinbefore defined. Examples of other therapeutic agents that may be administered together (whether concurrently or at different time intervals) with the compounds of the formula (lb) include but are not limited to topoisomerase inhibitors, alkylating agents, antimetabolites, DNA binders and microtubule inhibitors (tubulin targeting agents), such as cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, irinotecan, fludarabine, 5FU, taxanes, mitomycin C, or radiotherapy. Alternatively, the compounds of the formula (lb) can be administered in a combination therapy with monoclonal antibodies or signal transduction inhibitors. For the case of CDK inhibitors combined with other therapies, the two or more treatments may be given in individually varying dose schedules and via different routes.<br>
Where the compound of the formula (lb) is administered in combination therapy with one, two, three, four or more other therapeutic agents (preferably one or two, more preferably one), the compounds can be administered simultaneously or<br>
111<br><br>
sequentially. When administered sequentially, they can be administered at closely spaced intervals (for example over a period of 5-10 minutes) or at longer intervals (for example 1, 2, 3, 4 or more hours apart, or even longer periods apart where required), the precise dosage regimen being commensurate with the properties of the therapeutic agent(s).<br>
The compounds of the invention may also be administered in conjunction with non-chemotherapeutic treatments such as radiotherapy, photodynamic therapy, gene therapy; surgery and controlled diets.<br>
For use in combination therapy with another chemotherapeutic agent, the compound of the formula (lb) and one, two, three, four or more other therapeutic agents can be, for example, formulated together in a dosage form containing two, three, four or more therapeutic agents. In an alternative, the individual therapeutic agents may be formulated separately and presented together in the form of a kit, optionally with instructions for their use.<br>
A person skilled in the art would know through their common general knowledge the dosing regimes and combination therapies to use.<br>
Methods of Diagnosis<br>
Prior to administration of a compound of the formula (lb), a patient may be screened to determine whether a disease or condition from which the patient is or may be suffering is one which would be susceptible to treatment with a compound having activity against cyclin dependent kinases.<br>
For example, a biological sample taken from a patient may be analysed to determine whether a condition or disease, such as cancer, that the patient is or may be suffering from is one which is characterised by a genetic abnormality or abnormal protein expression which leads to over-activation of CDKs or to sensitisation of a pathway to normal CDK activity. Examples of such abnormalities that result in activation or sensitisation of the CDK2 signal include up-regulation of cyclin E, (Harwell RM, Mull BB, Porter DC, Keyomarsi K.; J Biol Chem. 2004 Mar 26;279(13): 12695-705) or loss of p21 or p27, or presence of CDC4 variants<br><br>
(Rajagopalan H, Jallepalli PV, Rago C, Velculescu VE, Kinzler KW, Vogelstein B, Lengauer C; Nature. 2004 Mar 4;428(6978):77-81). The term up-regulation includes elevated expression or over-expression, including gene amplification (i.e. multiple gene copies) and increased expression by a transcriptional effect, and hyperactivity and activation, including activation by mutations. Thus, the patient may be subjected to a diagnostic test to detect a marker characteristic of up-regulation of cyclin E, or loss of p21 or p27, or presence of CDC4 variants. The term diagnosis includes screening. By marker we include genetic markers including, for example, the measurement of DNA composition to identify mutations of CDC4. The term marker also includes markers which are characteristic of up regulation of cyclin E, including enzyme activity, enzyme levels, enzyme state (e.g. phosphorylated or not) and mRNA levels of the aforementioned proteins.<br>
Tumours with upregulation of cyclin E, or loss of p21 or p27 may be particularly sensitive to CDK inhibitors. Tumours may preferentially be screened for upregulation of cyclin E, or loss of p21 or p27 prior to treatment. Thus, the patient may be subjected to a diagnostic test to detect a marker characteristic of up¬regulation of cyclin E, or loss of p21 or p27. The diagnostic tests are typically conducted on a biological sample selected from tumour biopsy samples, blood samples (isolation and enrichment of shed tumour cells), stool biopsies, sputum, chromosome analysis, pleural fluid, peritoneal fluid, or urine.<br>
It has been found, Rajagopalan et al (Nature. 2004 Mar 4;428(6978):77-81), that there were mutations present in CDC4 (also known as Fbw7 or Archipelago) in human colorectal cancers and endometrial cancers (Spruck et al. Cancer Res. 2002 Aug 15;62(16):4535-9). Identification of individual carrying a mutation in CDC4 may mean that the patient would be particularly suitable for treatment with a CDK inhibitor. Tumours may preferentially be screened for presence of a CDC4 variant prior to treatment. The screening process will typically involve direct sequencing, oligonucleotide microarray analysis, or a mutant specific antibody.<br>
Methods of identification and analysis of mutations and up-regulation of proteins are known to a person skilled in the art. Screening methods could include, but are<br>
1fh<br><br>
not limited to, standard methods such as reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or in-situ hybridisation.<br>
In screening by RT-PCR, the level of mRNA in the tumour is assessed by creating a cDNA copy of the mRNA followed by amplification of the cDNA by PCR. Methods of PCR amplification, the selection of primers, and conditions for amplification, are known to a person skilled in the art. Nucleic acid manipulations and PCR are carried out by standard methods, as described for example in Ausubel, P.M. et al., eds. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, 2004, John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc., or Innis, M.A. et-al., eds. PCR Protocols: a guide to methods and applications, 1990, Academic Press, San Diego. Reactions and manipulations involving nucleic acid techniques are also described in Sambrook et al., 2001, 3'1' Ed, Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press. Alternatively a commercially available kit for RT-PCR (for example Roche Molecular Biochemicals) may be used, or methodology as set forth in United States patents 4,666,828; 4,683,202; 4,801,531; 5,192,659, 5,272,057, 5,882,864, and 6,218,529 and incorporated herein by reference.<br>
An example of an in-situ hybridisation technique for assessing mRNA expression would be fluorescence in-situ hybridisation (FISH) (see Angerer, 1987 Meth. Enzymol., 152:649).<br>
Generally, in situ hybridization comprises the following major steps: (1) fixation of tissue to be analyzed; (2) prehybridization treatment of the sample to increase accessibility of target nucleic acid, and to reduce nonspecific binding; (3) hybridization of the mixture of nucleic acids to the nucleic acid in the biological structure or tissue; (4) post-hybridization washes to remove nucleic acid fragments not bound in the hybridization, and (5) detection of the hybridized nucleic acid fragments. The probes used in such applications are typically labeled, for example, with radioisotopes or fluorescent reporters. Preferred probes are sufficiently long, for example, from about 50, 100, or 200 nucleotides to about 1000 or more nucleotides, to enable specific hybridization with the target nucleic acid(s) under stringent conditions. Standard methods for carrying out FISH are described in Ausubel, F.M. et al., eds. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, 2004, John<br>

Alternatively, the protein products expressed from the mRNAs may be assayed by immunohistochemistry of tumour samples, solid phase immunoassay with microtiter plates, Western blotting, 2-dimensional SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, ELISA, flow cytometry and other methods known in the art for detection of specific proteins. Detection methods would include the use of site specific antibodies. The skilled person will recognize that all such well-known techniques for detection of upregulation of cyclin E, or loss of p21 or p27, or detection of CDC4 variants could be applicable in the present case.<br>
Therefore all of these techniques could also be used to identify tumours particularly suitable for treatment with CDK inhibitors. Patients with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) could be selected for treatment with a CDK inhibitor using diagnostic tests outlined herein. MCL is a distinct clinicopathologic entity of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, characterized by proliferation of small to medium-sized lymphocytes with co-expression of CDS and CD20, an aggressive and incurable clinical course, and frequent t(l I;14)(ql3;q32) translocation. Over-expression of cyclin Dl mRNA, found in mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), is a critical diagnostic marker. Yatabe et al (Blood. 2000 Apr 1;95(7):2253-61) proposed that cyclin Dl-positivity should be included as one of the standard criteria for MCL, and that innovative therapies for this incurable disease should be explored on the basis of the new criteria. Jones et al (J Mol Diagn. 2004 May;6(2):84-9) developed a real-time, quantitative, reverse transcription PCR assay for cyclin Dl (CCNDl) expression to aid in the diagnosis of mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). Howe et al (Clin Chem. 2004 Jan;50(l):80-7) used real-time quantitative RT-PCRto evaluate cyclin Dl mRNA expression and found that quantitative RT-PCR for cyclin Dl mRNA normalized to CD 19 mRNA can be used in the diagnosis of MCL in blood, marrow, and tissue. Alternatively, patients with breast cancer could be selected for treatment with a CDK inhibitor using diagnostic tests outline above. Tumour cells commonly<br><br>
overexpress cyclin E and it has been shown that cycUn E is over-expressed in breast cancer (Harwell et al, Cancer Res, 2000, 60, 481-489). Therefore breast cancer may in particular be treated with a CDK inhibitor.<br>
Antifungal Use<br>
The compounds of the formulae (lb), (II), (III), (IV), (IVa), (Va), (Vb), (Via), (Vlb) and sub-groups thereof as defined herein can also be used as antifungal agents.<br>
The compounds may be used in animal medicine (for example in the treatment of mammals such as humans), or in the treatment of plants (e.g. in agriculture and horticulture), or as general antifungal agents, for example as preservatives and disinfectants.<br>
For example, compounds of the invention may be administered to human patients suffering from, or at risk of infection by, topical fungal infections caused by among other organisms, species of Candida, Trichophyton, Microsporum or Epidermophyton, or in mucosal infections caused by Candida albicans (e.g. thrush and vaginal candidiasis). The compounds of the invention can also be administered for the treatment or prophylaxis of systemic fungal infections caused by, for example, Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans, Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus fumigatus, Coccidiodies, Paracoccidioides, Histoplasma or Blastomyces.<br>
Antifungal compositions for agricultural (including horticultural) use can comprise a compound of the formula (lb) and sub-groups thereof such as formulae (II), (III), (IV), (V) and (VI) as hereinbefore defined together with an agriculturally acceptable diluent or carrier.<br>
Fungal infections in a plant or seed can be treated by a method which comprises treating the plant or seed with an antifungally effective amount of a fungicidal composition as hereinbefore defined.<br>
Differential screening assays may be used to select for those compounds of the present invention with specificity for non-human CDK enzymes. Compounds which act specifically on the CDK enzymes of eukaryotic pathogens can be used as anti-<br><br>
195<br><br>
11<br><br>
fungal or anti-parasitic agents. Inhibitors of the Candida CDK kinase, CKSl, can be used in the treatment of candidiasis. Antifungal agents can be used against infections of the type hereinbefore defined, or opportunistic infections that commonly occur in debilitated and immunosuppressed patients such as patients with leukemias and lymphomas, people who are receiving immunosuppressive therapy, and patients with predisposing conditions such as diabetes mellitus or AIDS, as well as for non-immunosuppressed patients.<br>
Assays described in the art can be used to screen for agents which may be useful for inhibiting at least one fungus implicated in mycosis such as candidiasis, aspergillosis, mucormycosis, blastomycosis, geotrichosis, cryptococcosis, chromoblastomycosis, coccidiodomycosis, conidiosporosis, histoplasmosis, maduromycosis, rhinosporidosis, nocaidiosis, para-actinomycosis, penicilliosis, monoliasis, or sporotrichosis. The differential screening assays can be used to identify anti-fungal agents which may have therapeutic value in the treatment of aspergillosis by making use of the CDK genes cloned from yeast such as Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus nidulans, or Aspergillus terreus, or where the mycotic infection is mucon-nycosis, the CDK assay can be derived from yeast such as Rhizopus arrhizus, Rhizopus oryzae, Absidia corymbifera, Absidia ramosa, or Mucorpusillus. Sources of other CDK enzymes include the pathogen Pneumocystis carinii.<br>
By way of example, in vitro evaluation of the antifungal activity of the compounds can be performed by determining the minimum inhibitory concentration (M.I.C.) which is the concentration of the test compounds, in a suitable medium, at which growth of the particular microorganism fails to occur. In practice, a series of agar plates, each having the test compound incorporated at a particular concentration is inoculated with a standard culture of, for example, Candida albicans and each plate is then incubated for an appropriate period at 37 °C. The plates are then examined for the presence or absence of growth of the fungus and the appropriate M.I.C. value is noted<br>
The in vivo evaluation of the compounds can be carried out at a series of dose levels by intraperitoneal or intravenous injection or by oral administration, to mice that<br>
96 
 <br>
have been inoculated with a fungus, e.g., a strain of Candida albicans or Aspergillus flavus. The activity of the compounds can be assessed on the basis of the survival of a treated group of mice after the death of an untreated group of mice. The activity may be measured in terms of the dose level at which the compound provides 50% protection against the lethal effect of the infection (PD50).<br>
For human antifungal use, the compounds can be administered alone or in admixture with a pharmaceutical carrier selected in accordance with the intended route of administration and standard pharmaceutical practice. Thus, for example, they may be administered orally, parenterally, intravenously, intramuscularly or subcutaneously by means of the formulations described above in the section headed "Pharmaceutical Formulations".<br>
For oral and parenteral administration to human patients, the daily dosage level of the antifungal compounds of the invention can be from 0.01 to 10 mg/kg (in divided doses), depending on inter alia the potency of the compounds when administered by either the oral or parenteral route. Tablets or capsules of the compounds may contain, for example, from 5 mg. to 0.5 g of active compound for administration singly or two or more at a time as appropriate. The physician in any event will determine the actual dosage (effective amount) which will be most suitable for an individual patient and it will vary with the age, weight and response of the particular patient.<br>
Alternatively, the antifungal compounds can be administered in the form of a suppository or pessary, or they may be applied topically in the form of a lotion, solution, cream, ointment or dusting powder. For example, they can be incorporated into a cream consisting of an aqueous emulsion of polyethylene glycols or liquid paraffin; or they can be incorporated, at a concentration between 1 and 10%, into an ointment consisting of a white wax or white soft paraffin base together with such stabilizers and preservatives as may be required.<br>
In addition to the therapeutic uses described above, anti-fungal agents developed with such differential screening assays can be used, for example, as preservatives in foodstuff, feed supplement for promoting weight gain in livestock, or in disinfectant<br><br>
formulations for treatment of non-living matter, e.g., for decontaminating hospital equipment and rooms. In similar fashion, side by side comparison of inhibition of a mammalian CDK and an insect CDK, such as the Drosophilia CDK5 gene (Hellmich et al. (1994) FEBS Lett 356:317-21), will permit selection amongst the compounds herein of inhibitors which discriminate between the human/mammalian and insect enzymes. Accordingly, the present invention expressly contemplates the use and formulations of the compounds of the invention in insecticides, such as for use in management of insects like the fruit fly.<br>
In yet another embodiment, certain of the subject CDK inhibitors can be selected on the basis of inhibitory specificity for plant CDK's relative to the mammalian enzyme. For example, a plant CDK can be disposed in a differential screen with one or more of the human enzymes to select those compounds of greatest selectivity for inhibiting the plant enzyme. Thus, the present invention specifically contemplates formulations of the subject CDK inhibitors for agricultural applications, such as in the form of a defoliant or the like.<br>
For agricultural and horticultural purposes the compounds of the invention may be used in the form of a composition formulated as appropriate to the particular use and intended purpose. Thus the compounds may be applied in the form of dusting powders, or granules, seed dressings, aqueous solutions, dispersions or emulsions, dips, sprays, aerosols or smokes. Compositions may also be supplied in the form of dispersible powders, granules or grains, or concentrates for dilution prior to use. Such compositions may contain such conventional carriers, diluents or adjuvants as are known and acceptable in agriculture and horticulture and they are manufactured in accordance with conventional procedures. The compositions may also incorporate other active ingredients, for example, compounds having herbicidal or insecticidal activity or a further fungicide. The compounds and compositions can be applied in a number of ways, for example they can be applied directly to the plant foliage, stems, branches, seeds or roots or to the soil or other growing medium, and they may be used not only to eradicate disease, but also prophylactically to protect the plants or seeds from attack. By way of example, the compositions may contain<br>
98-1<br><br>
from 0.01 to 1 wt.% of the active ingredient. For field use, likely application rates of the active ingredient may be from 50 to 5000 g/hectare.<br>
The compounds of the formula (la) and sub-groups thereof such as formulae (lb), (II), (III), (IV), (IVa), (Va), (Vb), (Via) and (VIb) and sub-groups thereof as defined herein can also be used in the control of wood decaying fungi and in the treatment of soil where plants grow, paddy fields for seedlings, or water for perfusion. The compounds of the formula (la) and sub-groups thereof such as formulae (lb), (II), (III), (IV), (IVa), (Va), (Vb), (Via), (Vlb) and sub-groups thereof as defined herein can also be used to protect stored grain and other non-plant loci from fungal infestation.<br>

•	Methods:<br>
Prior to using preparative chromatography to isolate and purify the product compounds, analytical LC-MS (see above) can first be used to determine the most appropriate conditions for preparative chromatography. A typical routine is to run an analytical LC-MS using the type of chromatography (low or high pH) most suited for compound structure. Once the analytical trace shows good chromatography, a suitable preparative method of the same type can be chosen. Typical running condition for both low and high pH chromatography methods are:<br>
Flow rate: 24 ml/min<br>
Gradient: Generally all gradients have an initial 0.4 min step with 95% A + 5% B. Then according to analytical trace a 3.6 min gradient is chosen in order to achieve good separation (e.g. from 5% to 50% B for early retaining compounds; from 35% to 80% B for middle retaining compounds and so on)<br>
Wash: 1 minute wash step is performed at the end of the gradient<br>

The antifungal activity of the compounds of the formula (lb) is determined using the following protocol.<br>
The compounds are tested against a panel of fungi including Candida parpsilosis, Candida tropicalis, Candida albicans-ATCC 36082 and Cryptococcus neoformans. The test organisms are maintained on Sabourahd Dextrose Agar slants at 4 °C. Singlet suspensions of each organism are prepared by growing the yeast overnight at 27 °C on a rotating drum in yeast-nitrogen base broth (YNB) with amino acids (Difco, Detroit, Mich.), pH 7.0 with 0.05 morpholine propanesulphonic acid (MOPS). The suspension is then centrifuged and washed twice with 0.85% NaCl before sonicating the washed cell suspension for 4 seconds (Branson Sonifier, model 350, Danbury, Conn.). The singlet blastospores are counted in a haemocytometer and adjusted to the desired concentration in 0.85% NaCl.<br>
The activity of the test compounds is determined using a modification of a broth microdilution technique. Test compounds are diluted in DMSO to a 1.0 mg/ml ratio then diluted to 64 |xg/ml in YNB broth, pH 7.0 with MOPS (Fluconazole is used as the control) to provide a working solution of each compound. Using a 96-well plate, wells 1 and 3 through 12 are prepared with YNB broth, ten fold dilutions of the compound solution are made in wells 2 to 11 (concentration ranges are 64 to 0.125 |xg/ml). Well 1 serves as a sterility control and blank for the spectrophotometric assays. Well 12 serves as a growth control. The microtitre plates are inoculated with 10 fj.1 in each of well 2 to 11 (final inoculum size is 10"* organisms/ml). Inoculated plates are incubated for 48 hours at 35 °C. The MIC values are determined spectrophotometrically by measuring the absorbance at 420 nm (Automatic Microplate Reader, DuPont Instruments, Wilmington, Del.) after agitation of the plates for 2 minutes with a vortex-mixer (Vorte-Genie 2 Mixer, Scientific Industries, Inc., Bolemia, N.Y.). The MIC endpoint is defined as the lowest drug concentration exhibiting approximately 50% (or more) reduction of the growth compared with the control well. With the turbidity assay this is defined as the lowest drug concentration at which turbidity in the well is
