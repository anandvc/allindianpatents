Any foregoing applications, and all documents cited therein or during their prosecution ("application cited documents") and all documents cited or referenced in the application cited documents, and all documents cited or referenced herein ("herein cited documents"), and all documents cited or referenced in herein cited documents, together with any manufacturer's instructions, descriptions, product specifications, and product sheets for any products mentioned herein or in any document incorporated by reference herein, are hereby incorporated herein by reference, and may be employed in the practice of the invention.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to 1-aryl-5-alkyl pyrazole compounds, of general formula (I):<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
wherein:<br>
R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6, R7 and p are as defined below; or a salt thereof and the use of<br>
these compounds against ectoparasites such as insects, arthropods and acarina.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Animals such as mammals and birds are often susceptible to parasite infestations. These parasites may be ectoparasites, such as insects, and endoparasites such as filariae and worms.<br>
Domesticated animals, such as cats and dogs, are often infested with one or more of the following ectoparasites:<br>
-	fleas (Ctenocephalides felis, Ctenocephalides sp. and the like),<br>
-	ticks (Rhipicephalus sp., Ixodes sp., Dermacentorsp., Amblyomma sp. and<br>
the like),<br>
-	mites (Demodexsp., Sarcoptes sp., Otodectessp. and the like),<br>
-	lice (Trichodectes sp., Cheyletiella sp., Linognathus sp., and the like), and<br>
-	flies (Hematobia sp., Musca sp., Stomoxys sp., Dermatobla sp., Cochliomyia<br>
sp., mosquitoes (family Culicidae) and the like).<br>
Fleas are a particular problem because not only do they adversely affect the health of the animal or human, but they also cause a great deal of psychological stress. Moreover, fleas are also vectors of pathogenic agents in animals, such as dog tapeworm (Dipylidium caninum), and may also transmit pathogens to humans.<br>
Similarly, ticks are also harmful to the physical and psychological health of the animal or human. However, the most serious problem associated with ticks is that they are the vector of pathogenic agents, which cause diseases in both humans and animals Major diseases which are caused by ticks include borreliosis (Lyme disease caused by Borrelia burgdorferi), babesiosis (or piroplasmosis caused by Babesia sp.) and rickettsiosis (also known as Rocky Mountain spotted fever). Ticks also release toxins which cause inflammation or paralysis in the host. Occasionally, these toxins are fatal to the host, such as in the case of the Australian paralysis tick, Ixodes holocyclus.<br>
Moreover, mites and lice are particularly difficult to combat since there are very few active substances which act on these parasites and they require frequent treatment.<br>
Likewise, farm animals are also susceptible to parasite infestations. For example, cattle are affected by a large number of parasites. Likewise, arthropod pests, such as fleas, lice and ticks, and mites infest poultry. A parasite that is very prevalent among farm animals is the tick genus Boophilus, especially those of the species microplus (cattle tick), decoloratus and anulatus. Ticks, such as Boophilus microplus, are particularly difficult to control because they live in the pasture where the farm animals graze. Other important parasites of cattle and sheep are listed as follows in order of decreasing importance:<br>
(a) myiases such as Dermatobia hominis (known as Berne in Brazil), Hypoderma, and Cochlyomia hominivorax (greenbottle); sheep myiases such as Lucilia sericata, Lucilia cuprina (known as blowfly strike in Australia, New Zealand and South Africa). These are flies whose larva constitutes the animal parasite;<br>
(b)	flies proper, namely those whose adult constitutes the parasite, such as<br>
Haematobia irritans (horn fly);<br>
(c)	lice such as Linognathus vitulieic.', and<br>
(d)	mites such as Sarcoptes scato/e/and Psoroptes ovis.<br>
The compounds of the invention may also be useful against household pests including, but not limited to, cockroach, Blatella sp., clothes moth, Tineola sp., carpet beetle, Attagenus sp. and the housefly Musca domestica and against Solenopsis invicta (imported fire ants), termites, and the like.<br>
These compounds may further be useful against agricultural pests such as aphids (Acyrthiosiphon sp.), locusts, and boll weevils as well as against insect pests that attack stored grains, such as Tribolium sp., and against immature stages of insects living on plant tissue.<br>
The above list is not exhaustive and other ectoparasites are well known in the art to be harmful to animals, humans and crops.<br>
Compounds that exhibit a degree of activity against a wide range of ectoparasites including arthopods and insects are known in the art. One such class of compounds is the arylpyrazoles which are referred to, for example, in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,122,530; 5,246,255; 5,576,429; 5,885,607; 6,010,710; 6,083,519; 6,096,329; 6,685,954; EP 0 234 119 and EP 0 295 117 (U.S. Patent Nos. 5,232,940; 5,547,974; 5,608,077; 5,714,191; 5,916,618 and 6,372,774); EP 0 352 944 (U.S. Patent No. 4,963,575); EP 0 780 378 (U.S. Patent No. 5,817,688; 5,922,885; 5,994,386; 6,124,339; 6,180,798 and 6,395,906); EP 0 846 686 (U.S. Patent No. 6,069,157); and WO 98/28278.<br>
The arylpyrazoles are known to possess excellent activity against insects, such as fleas and ticks. Fipronil is a specific type of 1-N-aryl pyrazole that is particularly effective against fleas and ticks and is the active ingredient in Frontline® and Frontline Plus®. Fipronil has the following chemical structure:<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
However, ectoparasiticidal agents can vary in their effectiveness to a particular parasite as well as vary in their cost of production. Moreover, the results of ectoparasiticidal agents may not always be satisfactory because of, for example, the development of resistance by the parasite to the therapeutic agent, as is the case, for example, with carbamates, organophosphorus compounds and pyrethroids.<br>
It is known from the literature that hydrazines may react with 1,3-dicarbonyl compounds to form pyrazoles. For example, US Patent No. 6,750,230 refers to the synthesis of pyrazoles unsubstituted at the one position or substituted by an alkylene group from 1,3-diketones. WO 01/32663 refers to the synthesis of pyrazolecarboxylic acid tricyclic compounds. WO 03/057674 refers to the synthesis of 4-sulfide/sulfoxidepyrazoles bearing a substituted alkyl group at the 1-position, which may be prepared from the reaction of a 2-thio-1,3-diketone with a hydrazine (see page 24, Reaction Scheme 1). However, there appeared to be no examples where this 2-thio-1,3-diketone derivative was made directly by reacting a sulfenyl halide reagent with 1,3-diketone compounds.<br>
WO 02/058690 and US 2004/0876627 refer to the synthesis of pyrazoles bearing a (2,2,2-trifluoro-1-hydroxy-1-(trifluoromethyl)ethyl substituent by reaction between a 1,3-diketone and phenylhydrazine bearing the 1-hydroxy-1-(trifluoromethyl)ethyl substituent (Scheme 4, page 11, US 2004/0876627). The synthesis of a specific compound by this method, 5-methyl-1-[(1-hydroxy-1 -(trifluoromethyl)ethyl)phenyl)-1 H-pyrazole-3-carboxylic acid ethyl ester is mentioned (US 2004/0876627, pages 23-24, Example 8 ). However, there appeared to be no examples where a 3,4,5-disubstituted pyrazole is prepared except in the presence of a 5-amino group or when all three substitutions are the same (methyl).<br>
Synthesis of 3-ester-4-unsubstituted pyrazoles is also referred to in US 2005/00020564 (page 10, Scheme 3).<br>
However, a general problem with obtaining pyrazoles by reacting hydrazines with 1,3-dicarbonyl compounds is the difficulty in preparing compounds with regioselectivity, as there is competition in the reaction at the different carbonyl groups of the 1,3-dicarbonyl compound<br>
Thus, there is still a need in the art for more effective and rapidly acting antiparasitic composition for the treatment and protection of animals, e.g. mammals, fish and birds, from a wide range of parasites. There is a need in the art for an antiparasitic formulation which is easy to use on any type of domestic animal, irrespective of its size and the nature of its coat and which do not need to be sprinkled over the entire body of the mammal, fish or bird. Further, the formulation should be<br>
effective for a long period of time thereby reducing the number of times it has to be applied.<br>

Compositions<br>
Also contemplated within the scope of the invention are acid or base salts, where applicable, of the 1 -aryl-5-alkyl-pyrazoles provided for herein.<br>
The term "acid" contemplates all pharmaceutically, veterinary or agriculturally acceptable inorganic or organic acids. Inorganic acids include mineral acids such as hydrohalic acids, such as hydrobromic and hydrochloric acids, sulfuric acids, phosphoric acids and nitric acids. Organic acids include all pharmaceutically acceptable aliphatic, alicyclic and aromatic carboxylic acids, dicarboxylic acids<br>
tricarboxylic acids and fatty acids. In one embodiment of the acids, the acids are straight chain or branched, saturated or unsaturated C1-C20. aliphatic carboxylic acids, which are optionally substituted by halogen or by hydroxyl groups, or C6-C12 aromatic carboxylic acids. Examples of such acids are carbonic acid, formic acid, fumaric acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, isopropionic acid, valeric acid, a-hydroxy acids, such as glycolic acid and lactic acid, chloroacetic acid, benzole acid, methane sulfonic acid, and salicylic acid. Examples of dicarboxylic acids include oxalic acid, malic acid, succinic acid, tataric acid and maleic acid. An example of a tricarboxylic acid is citric acid. Fatty acids include all pharmaceutically or veterinary acceptable saturated or unsaturated aliphatic or aromatic carboxylic acids having 4 to 24 carbon atoms. Examples include butyric acid, isobutyric acid, sec-butyric acid, lauric acid, palmitic acid, stearic acid, oleic acid, linoleic acid, linolenic acid, and phenylsteric acid. Other acids include gluconic acid, glycoheptonic acid and lactobionic acid.<br>
The term "base" contemplates all pharmaceutically, veterinary or agriculturally acceptable inorganic or organic bases. Such bases include, for example, the alkali metal and alkaline earth metal salts, such as the lithium, sodium, potassium, magnesium or calcium salts. Organic bases include the common hydrocarbyl and heterocyclic amine salts, which include, for example, the morpholine and piperidine salts.<br>
Ectoparasiticidal compositions of the invention comprise a 1-aryl-5-alkyl pyrazole and an acceptable carrier, for example a veterinarily acceptable carrier or an ectoparasiticidally acceptable carrier. In one embodiment of the invention, the ectoparasiticidally acceptable carrier is an organic solvent commonly used in the formulation art. These organic solvents may be found, for example, in Remington Pharmaceutical Science, 16th Edition (1986). These solvents include, for example, acetone, ethyl acetate, methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, dimethylformamide, dichloromethane or diethylene glycol monoethyl ether (Transcutol). These solvents can be supplemented by various excipients according to the nature of the desired phases, such as C8-C10 caprylic/capric triglyceride (Estasan or Miglyol 812), oleic acid or propylene glycol.<br>
Pesticidal compositions of the invention comprise a 1 -aryl-5-alkyl pyrazole and an acceptable carrier, for example a agriculturally acceptable carrier. In one embodiment of the invention, the agriculturally acceptable carrier is an organic solvent commonly used in the formulation art. These organic solvents may be found, for example, in C. Marsden, "Solvents Guide", 2nd Ed., Interscience, N.Y. 1963. These solvents include, for example, acetone, butanol, cyclohexanone, dimethylformamide,<br>
xylene or else higher-boiling aromatics or hydrocarbons or mixtures of these.  These<br>
solvents   can   be   supplemented   by   various   ionic   and/or   nonionic   surfactants<br>
(emulsifiers).<br>
Formulations and Administration for Pharmaceutical/Veterinary Use<br>
The composition of the invention can also be in a variety of forms which include, but are not limited to, oral formulations, injectable formulations, and topical, dermal or subdermal formulations.<br>
The composition of the invention may be in a form suitable for oral use, for example, as baits (see, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 4,564,631), dietary supplements, troches, lozenges, chewables, tablets, hard or soft capsules, emulsions, aqueous or oily suspensions, aqueous or oily solutions, oral drench formulations, dispersible powders or granules, syrups or elixirs, enteric formulations or pastes. Compositions intended for oral use may be prepared according to any method known in the art for the manufacture of pharmaceutical compositions and such compositions may contain one or more agents selected from the group consisting of sweetening agents, bittering agents, flavoring agents, coloring agents and preserving agents in order to provide pharmaceutically elegant and palatable preparations.<br>
Tablets may contain the active ingredient in admixture with non-toxic, pharmaceutically acceptable excipients which are suitable for the manufacture of tablets. These excipients may be, for example, inert diluents, such as calcium carbonate, sodium carbonate, lactose, calcium phosphate or sodium phosphate; granulating and disintegrating agents, for example, corn starch, or alginic acid; binding agents, for example starch, gelatin or acacia, and lubricating agents, for example, magnesium stearate, stearic acid or talc, the tablets may be uncoated or they may be coated by known techniques to delay disintegration and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby provide a sustained action over a longer period. For example, a time delay material such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate may be employed. They may also be coated by the technique described in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,256,108; 4,166,452; and 4,265,874 (incorporated herein by reference) to form osmotic therapeutic tablets for controlled release.<br>
Formulations for oral use may be hard gelatin capsules, wherein the active ingredient is mixed with an inert solid diluent, for example, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate or kaolin. Capsules may also be soft gelatin capsules, wherein the active ingredient is mixed with water or miscible solvents such as propylene glycol, PEGs and ethanol, or an oil medium, for example peanut oil, liquid paraffin, or olive oil.<br>
The compositions of the invention may also be in the form of oil-in-water or water-in-oil emulsions. The oily phase maybe a vegetable oil, for example, olive oil or arachis oil, or a mineral oil, for example, liquid paraffin or mixtures of these. Suitable emulsifying agents may be naturally-occurring phosphatides, for example, soy bean, lecithin, and esters or partial esters derived from fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides, for example, sorbitan monoleate, and condensation products of the said partial esters with ethylene oxide, for example, polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate. The emulsions may also contain sweetening agents, bittering agents, flavoring agents, and/or preservatives.<br>
In one embodiment of the formulation, the composition of the invention is in the form of a microemulsion. Microemulsions are well suited as the liquid carrier vehicle. Microemulsions are quaternary systems comprising an aqueous phase, an oily phase, a surfactant and a cosurfactant. They are translucent and isotropic liquids.<br>
Microemulsions are composed of stable dispersions of microdroplets of the aqueous phase in the oily phase or conversely of microdroplets of the oily phase in the aqueous phase. The size of these microdroplets is less than 200 nm (1000 to 100,000 nm for emulsions). The interracial film is composed of an alternation of surface-active (SA) and co-surface-active (Co-SA) molecules which, by lowering the interfacial tension, allows the microemulsion to be formed spontaneously.<br>
In one embodiment of the oily phase, the oily phase can be formed from mineral or vegetable oils, from unsaturated polyglycosylated glycerides or from triglycerides, or alternatively from mixtures of such compounds. In one embodiment of the oily phase, the oily phase comprises of triglycerides; in another embodiment of the oily phase, the triglycerides are medium-chain triglycerides, for example C8-C10 caprylic/capric triglyceride. In another embodiment of the oily phase will represent a % v/v range selected from the group consisting of about 2 to about 15%; about 7 to about 10%; and about 8 to about 9% v/v of the microemulsion.<br>
The aqueous phase includes, for example water or glycol derivatives, such as propylene glycol, glycol ethers, polyethylene glycols or glycerol. In one embodiment of the glycol derivatives, the glycol is selected from the group consisting of propylene glycol, diethylene glycol monoethyl ether, dipropylene glycol monoethyl ether and mixtures thereof. Generally, the aqueous phase will represent a proportion from about 1 to about 4% v/v in the microemulsion.<br>
Surfactants for the microemulsion include diethylene glycol monoethyl ether, dipropyelene glycol monomethyl ether, polyglycolyzed C8-C10 glycerides or<br>
polyglyceryl-6 dioleate.    In addition to these surfactants, the cosurfactants include short-chain alcohols, such as ethanol and propanol.<br>
Some compounds are common to the three components discussed above, i.e., aqueous phase, surfactant and cosurfactant. However, it is well within the skill level of the practitioner to use different compounds for each component of the same formulation. In one embodiment for the amount of surfactant/cosurfactant, the cosurfactant to surfactant ratio will be from about 1/7 to about 1/2. In another embodiment for the amount of cosurfactant, there will be from about 25 to about 75% v/v of surfactant and from about 10 to about 55% v/v of cosurfactant in the microemulsion.<br>
Oily suspensions may be formulated by suspending the active ingredient in a vegetable oil, for example, atachis oil, olive oil, sesame oil or coconut oil, or in mineral oil such as liquid paraffin. The oily suspensions may contain a thickening agent, for example, beeswax, hard paraffin or cetyl alcohol. Sweetening agents such as sucrose, saccharin or aspartame, bittering agents, and flavoring agents may be added to provide a palatable oral preparation. These compositions may be preserved by the addition of an anti-oxidant such as ascorbic acid, or other known preservatives.<br>
Aqueous suspensions may contain the active material in admixture with excipients suitable for the manufacture of aqueous suspensions. Such excipients are suspending agents, for example, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, methylcellulose, hydroxy-propylmethylcellulose, sodium alginate, polvinylpyrrolidone, gum tragacanth and gum acacia; dispersing or wetting agents may be a naturally-occuring phosphatide, for example lecithin, or condensation products of an alkylene oxide with fatty acids, for example polyoxyethylene stearate, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with long chain aliphatic alcohols, for example, heptadecaethyleneoxycetanol, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with partial esters derived from fatty acids and a hexitol such as polyoxyethylene sorbitol monooleate, or condensation products of ethylene oxide, with partial esters derived from fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides, for example polyethylene sorbitan monooleate. The aqueous suspensions may also contain one or more preservatives, for example ethyl, or n-propyl, p-hydroxybenzoate, one or more coloring agents, one or more flavoring agents, and one or more sweetening agents and/or bittering agents, such as those set forth above.<br>
Dispersible powders and granules suitable for preparation of an aqueous suspension by the addition of water provide the active ingredient in admixture with a dispersing or wetting agent, suspending agent and one or more preservatives.<br>
Suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents are exemplified by those already mentioned above. Additional excipients, for example, sweetening, bittering, flavoring and coloring agents, may also be present.<br>

In another embodiment of the invention, the composition can be in paste form. Examples of embodiments in a paste form include but are not limited to those described in U.S. Patent Nos. 6,787,342 and 7,001,889 (each of which are incorporated herein by reference). In addition to the 1-aryl-5-alkyl pyrazole compound of the invention, the paste can also contain fumed silica; a viscosity modifier; a carrier; optionally, an absorbent; and optionally, a colorant, stabilizer, surfactant, or preservative.<br>
The process for preparing a paste formulation comprises the steps of:<br>
(a)	dissolving or dispersing the 1-aryl-5-alkyl compound into the carrier by<br>
mixing;<br>
(b)	adding the fumed silica to the carrier containing the dissolved 1 -aryl-5-<br>
alkyl pyrazole compound and mixing until the silica is dispersed in the carrier;<br>
(c)	allowing the intermediate formed in (b) to settle for a time sufficient in<br>
order to allow the air entrapped during step (b) to escape; and<br>
(d)	adding the viscosity modifier to the intermediate with mixing to produce<br>
a uniform paste.<br>
The above steps are illustrative, but not limiting. For example, step (a) can be the last step.<br>
In one embodiment of the formulation, the formulation is a paste containing 1-aryl-5-alkyl pyrazole compound, fumed silica, a viscosity modifier, an absorbent, a colorant; and a hydrophilic carrier which is triacetin, a monoglyceride, a diglyceride, or a triglyceride.<br>
The paste may also include, but is not limited to, a viscosity modifier selected from the group consisting of PEG 200, PEG 300, PEG 400, PEG 600, monoethanolamine, triethanolamine, glycerol, propylene glycol, polyoxyethylene (20) sorbitan mono-oleate (polysorbate 80 or Tween 80), and polyoxamers (e.g., Pluronic L 81); an absorbent selected from the group consisting of magnesium carbonate, calcium carbonate, starch, and cellulose and its derivatives; and a colorant selected from the group consisting of titanium dioxide iron oxide, and FD&amp;C Blue #1 Aluminum Lake.<br>
The compositions may be in the form of a sterile injectable aqueous or oleagenous suspension. This suspension may be formulated according to the known art using those suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents which have been mentioned above. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non-toxic parenterally-aceptable diluent or solvent, for example, as a solution in 1,3-butane diol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. Cosolvents such as ethanol, propylene glycol or polyethylene glycols may also be used. Preservatives, such as phenol or benzyl alcohol, may be used.<br>
In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid find use in the preparation of injectables.<br>
Topical, dermal and subdermal formulations can include emulsions, creams, ointments, gels, pastes, powders, shampoos, pour-on formulations, ready-to-use formulations, spot-on solutions and suspensions. Topical application of an inventive compound or of a composition including at least one inventive compound among active agent(s) therein, a spot-on composition, can allow for the inventive compound to be distributed through the glands (e.g. sebaceous glands) of the animal and/or allow active agent(s) to achieve a systemic effect (plasma concentration) or throughout the haircoat. When the compound is distributed throughout glands, the glands can act as a reservoir, whereby there can be a long-lasting, e.g. 1-2 months effect. Spot-on formulations are typically applied in a localized region which refers to an area other than the entire animal. In one embodiment of a localized region, the location is between the shoulders. In another embodiment of a localized region is a stripe, e.g. a stripe from head to tail of the animal.<br>
Pour-on formulations are described in U.S. Patent No. 6,010,710, incorporated herein by reference. The pour-on formulations are advantageously oily, and generally comprise a diluent or vehicle and also a solvent (e.g. an organic solvent) for the active ingredient if the latter is not soluble in the diluent.<br>

Spot-on formulations may be prepared by dissolving the active ingredients into the pharmaceutically or veterinary acceptable vehicle. Alternatively, the spot-on formulation can be prepared by encapsulation of the active ingredient to leave a residue of the therapeutic agent on the surface of the animal. These formulations will vary with regard to the weight of the therapeutic agent in the combination depending on the species of host animal to be treated, the severity and type of infection and the body weight of the host.<br>
Dosage forms may contain from about 0.5 mg to about 5 g of an active agent. In one embodiment of the dosage form, the dosage is from about 1 mg to about 500 mg of an active agent, typically about 25 mg, about 50 mg, about 100 mg, about 200 mg, about 300 mg, about 400 mg, about 500 mg, about 600 mg, about 800 mg, or about 1000 mg.<br>

Components which may be employed for the active substances according to the invention in mixed formulations, for example, known active compounds which are based on an inhibition of, for example, acetolactate synthase, acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase, PS I, PS II, HPPDO, phytoene desaturase, protoporphyrinogen oxidase, glutamine synthetase, cellulose biosynthesis, 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthetase. Such compounds, and also other compounds which can be employed, whose mechanism of action is to a degree unknown or different, are described, for example, in Weed Research 26, 441-445 (1986), or "The Pesticide Manual", 12th Edition 2000 (hereinbelow also abbreviated to "PM"), The British Crop Protection Council and the Royal Soc. of Chemistry (editors) and literature cited therein.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) can be formulated in various ways, depending on the prevailing biological and/or chemico-physical parameters. Examples of possible formulations which are suitable are: wettable powders (WP), water-soluble powders (SP), water-soluble concentrates, emulsifiable concentrates (EC), emulsions (EW) such as oil-in-water and water-in-oil emulsions, sprayable solutions, suspension concentrates (SC), dispersions on an oil or water basis, solutions which are miscible with oil, capsule suspensions (CS), dusts (DP), seed-dressing products, granules for broadcasting and soil application, granules (GR) in the form of microgranules, spray granules, coated granules and adsorption granules, water-dispersible granules (WG), water-soluble granules (SG), ULV formulations, microcapsules and waxes.<br>
The formulations mentioned can be prepared in a manner known per se, for example by mixing the active compounds with at least one solvent or diluent, emulsifier, dispersant and/or binder or fixative, water repellent and optionally one or more of a desiccant, UV stabilizer, a colorant, a pigment and other processing auxiliaries.<br>
These individual formulation types are known in principle and described, for example, in: Winnacker-Kuchler, "Chemische Technologic" [Chemical Technology], Volume 7, C. Mauser Verlag, Munich, 4th Edition 1986; Wade van Valkenburg, "Pesticide Formulations", Marcel Dekker, N.Y., 1973; K. Martens, "Spray Drying Handbook", 3rd Ed. 1979, G. Goodwin Ltd. London.<br>
The necessary formulation auxiliaries such as inert materials, surfactants, solvents and other additives are also known and described, for example, in: Watkins, "Handbook of Insecticide Dust Diluents and Carriers", 2nd Ed., Darland Books, Caldwell N.J.; H.v. Olphen, "Introduction to Clay Colloid Chemistry", 2nd Ed., J. Wiley &amp; Sons, N.Y.; C. Marsden, "Solvents Guide", 2nd Ed., Interscience, N.Y. 1963; McCutcheon's "Detergents and Emulsifiers Annual", MC Publ. Corp., Ridgewood N.J.; Sisley and Wood, "Encyclopedia of Surface Active Agents", Chem. Publ. Co. Inc., N.Y. 1964; Schonfeldt, "Grenzflachenaktive Athylenoxidaddukte" [Surface-active ethylene oxide adducts], Wiss. Verlagsgesell., Stuttgart 1976; Winnacker-Kuchler, "Chemische Technologie" [Chemical Technology], Volume 7, C. Hauser Verlag, Munich, 4th Ed. 1986.<br>
Wettable powders are preparations which are uniformly dispersible in water and which, besides the compounds of formula (I), also comprise ionic and/or nonionic surfactants (wetters, dispersants), for example, polyoxyethylated alkylphenols, polyoxyethylated fatty alcohols, polyoxyethylated fatty amines, fatty alcohol polyglycol ether sulfates, alkanesulfonates or alkylbenzenesulfonates, sodium lignosulfonate,<br>
sodium 2,2'-dinaphthylmethane-6,6'-disulfonate, sodium dibutylnaphthalenesulfonate or else sodium oleoylmethyltaurinate, in addition to a diluent or inert substance. To prepare the wertable powders, the compounds of formula (I) are, for example, ground finely in conventional apparatuses such as hammer mills, blower mills and air-jet mills and mixed with the formulation auxiliaries, either concomitantly or thereafter.<br>
Emulsifiable concentrates are prepared, for example, by dissolving the compounds of formula (I) in an organic solvent, for example butanol, cyclohexanone, dimethylformamide, xylene or else higher-boiling aromatics or hydrocarbons or mixtures of these, with addition of one or more ionic and/or nonionic surfactants (emulsifiers). Emulsifiers which can be used are, for example: calcium salts of alkylarylsulfonic acids, such as calcium dodecylbenzenesulfonate or nonionic emulsifiers, such as fatty acid polyglycol esters, alkylaryl polyglycol ethers, fatty alcohol polyglycol ethers, propylene oxide/ethylene oxide condensates, alkyl polyethers, sorbitan esters such as sorbitan fatty acid esters or polyoxyethylene sorbitan esters such as polyoxyethylene sorbitan fatty acid esters.<br>
Dusts are obtained by grinding the active substance with finely divided solid substances, for example talc or natural clays, such as kaolin, bentonite or pyrophyllite, or diatomaceous earth.<br>
Suspension concentrates may be water- or oil-based. They can be prepared, for example, by wet grinding by means of commercially available bead mills, if appropriate with addition of surfactants, as they have already been mentioned above for example in the case of the other formulation types.<br>
Emulsions, for example oil-in-water emulsions (EW), can be prepared for example by means of stirrers, colloid mills and/or static mixtures using aqueous organic solvents and, if appropriate, surfactants as they have already been mentioned above for example in the case of the other formulation types.<br>
Granules can be prepared either by spraying the compounds of formula (I) onto adsorptive, granulated inert material or by applying active substance concentrates onto the surface of carriers such as sand, kaolinites or of granulated inert material, by means of binders, for example polyvinyl alcohol, sodium polyacrylate or alternatively mineral oils. Suitable active substances can also be granulated in the manner which is conventional for the production of fertilizer granules, if desired in a mixture with fertilizers.<br>
Water-dispersible granules are prepared, as a rule, by the customary processes such as spray-drying, fluidized-bed granulation, disk granulation, mixing in high-speed mixers and extrusion without solid inert material. To prepare disk,<br>
fluidized-bed, extruder and spray granules, see, for example, processes in "Spray-Drying Handbook" 3rd ed. 1979, G. Goodwin Ltd., London; J.E. Browning, "Agglomeration", Chemical and Engineering 1967, pages 147 et seq.; "Perry's Chemical Engineer's Handbook", 5th Ed., McGraw-Hill, New York 1973, p. 8-57.<br>
In general, the agrochemical preparations comprise a range selected from the group consisting of about 0.1 to about 99% by weight and about 0.1 to about 95% by weight, of compounds of formula (I).<br>
The concentration of compounds of formula (I) in wettable powders is, for example, about 10 to about 90% by weight, the remainder to 100% by weight being composed of customary formulation components. In the case of emulsifiable concentrates, the concentration of compounds of formula (I) can amount to ranges selected from the group consisting of about 1 % to about 90% and about 5% to about 80% by weight. Formulations in the form of dusts usually comprise in the range selected from the group consisting of about 1% to about 30% by weight of compounds of formula (I) and about 5% to about 20% by weight of compounds of formula (I). For sprayable solutions comprise a range selected from the group consisting of about 0.05% to about 80% by weight of compounds of formula (I) and about 2% to about 50% by weight of compounds of formula (I). In the case of water-dispersible granules, the content of compounds of formula (I) depends partly on whether the compounds of formula (I) are in liquid or solid form and on which granulation auxiliaries, fillers and the like are being used. The water-dispersible granules, for example, comprise a range selected from the group consisting of between about 1 and about 95% and between about 10% and about 80% by weight.<br>
In addition, the formulations of compounds of formula (I) mentioned comprise, if appropriate, the adhesives, wetters, dispersants, emulsifiers, penetrants, preservatives, antifreeze agents, solvents, fillers, carriers, colorants, antifoams, evaporation inhibitors, pH regulators and viscosity regulators which are conventional in each case.<br>
The mixtures according to the invention can be applied via the soil either pre-emergently or post-emergently. The mixtures according to the invention can also be applied via the leaf. The mixtures according to the invention can be employed for seed dressing. It is also possible to apply the mixtures according to the invention via an irrigation system, for example via the water for irrigation.<br>
When used as insecticides, the active compounds according to the invention can furthermore be present in their commercially available formulations and in the use forms, prepared from these formulations, as a mixture with synergists. Synergists are<br>
compounds which increase the action of the active compounds, without it being necessary for the synergistic agent added to be active itself.<br>
When used as insecticides, the active compounds according to the invention can furthermore be present in their commercially available formulations and in the use forms, prepared from these formulations, as a mixture with inhibitors which reduce degradation of the active compound after use in the environment of the plant, on the surface of parts of plants or in plant tissues.<br>
The active compound content of the use forms prepared from the commercially available formulations can vary within wide limits. The active compound concentration of the use forms can be from about 0.00000001 to about 95% by weight of active compound, preferably between about 0.00001 and about 1% by weight.<br>
The active compounds are employed in a customary manner appropriate for the use forms.<br>
All plants and plant parts can be treated in accordance with the invention. Plants are to be understood as meaning in the present context all plants and plant populations such as desired and undesired wild plants or crop plants (including naturally occurring crop plants). Crop plants can be plants which can be obtained by conventional plant breeding and optimization methods or by biotechnological and genetic engineering methods or by combinations of these methods, including the transgenic plants and including the plant cultivars protectable or not protectable by plant breeders' rights. Plant parts are to be understood as meaning all parts and organs of plants above and below the ground, such as shoot, leaf, flower and root, examples which may be mentioned being leaves, needles, stalks, stems, flowers, fruit bodies, fruits, seeds, roots, tubers and rhizomes. The plant parts also include harvested material, and vegetative and generative propagation material, for example cuttings, tubers, rhizomes, offshoots and seeds.<br>
Treatment according to the invention of the plants and plant parts with the active compounds is carried out directly or by allowing the compounds to act on the surroundings, habitat or storage space by the customary treatment methods, for example by immersion, spraying, evaporation, fogging, scattering, painting on, injection and, in the case of propagation material, in particular in the case of seeds, also by applying one or more coats.<br>
The active compounds according to the invention are particularly suitable for treating seed. Here, the active compounds according to the invention mentioned above as preferred or particularly preferred may be mentioned as being preferred. Thus, a large part of the damage to crop plants which is caused by pests occurs as early as<br>
when the seed is attacked during storage and after the seed is introduced into the soil, during and immediately after germination of the plants. This phase is particularly critical since the roots and shoots of the growing plant are particularly sensitive and even minor damage can lead to the death of the whole plant. Protecting the seed and the germinating plant by the use of suitable active compounds is therefore of particularly great interest.<br>
The control of pests by treating the seeds of plants has been known for a long time and is the subject of continuous improvements. However, the treatment of seed entails a series of problems which cannot always be solved in a satisfactory manner. Thus, it is desirable to develop methods for protecting the seed and the germinating plant which dispense with the additional application of crop protection agents after sowing or after the emergence of the plants. It is furthermore desirable to optimize the amount of active compound employed in such a way as to provide maximum protection for the seed and the germinating plant from attack by pests, but without damaging the plant itself by the active compound employed. In particular, methods for the treatment of seed should also take into consideration the intrinsic insecticidal properties of transgenic plants in order to achieve optimum protection of the seed and the germinating plant with a minimum of crop protection agents being employed.<br>
The present invention therefore in particular also relates to a method for the protection of seed and germinating plants from attack by pests, by treating the seed with an active compound according to the invention. The invention likewise relates to the use of the active compounds according to the invention for the treatment of seed for protecting the seed and the resultant plant from pests. Furthermore, the invention relates to seed which has been treated with an active compound according to the invention so as to afford protection from pests.<br>
One of the advantages of the present invention is that the particular systemic properties of the active compounds according to the invention mean that treatment of the seed with these active compounds not only protects the seed itself, but also the resulting plants after emergence, from pests. In this manner, the immediate treatment of the crop at the time of sowing or shortly thereafter can be dispensed with.<br>
Furthermore, it must be considered as advantageous that the active compounds according to the invention can also be employed in particular in transgenic seed, the plants arising from this seed being capable of expressing a protein directed against pests. By treating such seed with the active compounds according to the invention, certain pests can be controlled merely by the expression of the, for example,<br>
insecticidal protein, and additionally be protected by the active compounds according to the invention against damage.<br>
The active compounds according to the invention are suitable for protecting seed of any plant variety as already mentioned above which is employed in agriculture, in the greenhouse, in forests or in horticulture. In particular, this takes the form of seed of maize, peanut, canola, oilseed rape, poppy, soya beans, cotton, beet (for example sugar beet and fodder beet), rice, sorghum and millet, wheat, barley, oats, rye, sunflower, tobacco, potatoes or vegetables (for example tomatoes, cabbage plants). The active compounds according to the invention are likewise suitable for treating the seed of fruit plants and vegetables as already mentioned above. The treatment of the seed of maize, soya beans, cotton, wheat and canola or oilseed rape is of particular importance.<br>
As already mentioned above, the treatment of transgenic seed with an active compound according to the invention is also of particular importance. This takes the form of seed of plants which, as a rule, comprise at least one heterologous gene which governs the expression of a polypeptide with in particular insecticidal properties. In this context, the heterologous genes in transgenic seed may be derived from microorganisms such as Bacillus, Rhizobium, Pseudomonas, Serratia, Trichoderma, Clavibacter, Glomus or Gliocladium. The present invention is particularly suitable for the treatment of transgenic seed which comprises at least one heterologous gene orignating from Bacillus sp. and whose gene product shows activity against the European corn borer and/or the corn root worm. It is particularly preferably a heterologous gene derived from Bacillus thuringiensis.<br>
In the context of the present invention, the active compound according to the invention is applied to the seed either alone or in a suitable formulation. Preferably, the seed is treated in a state which is stable enough to avoid damage during treatment. In general, the seed may be treated at any point in time between harvest and sowing. The seed usually used has been separated from the plant and freed from cobs, shells, stalks, coats, hairs or the flesh of the fruits.<br>
When treating the seed, care must generally be taken that the amount of the active compound according to the invention applied to the seed and/or the amount of further additives is chosen in such a way that the germination of the seed is not adversely affected, or that the resulting plant is not damaged. This must be borne in mind in particular in the case of active compounds which may have phytotoxic effects at certain application rates.<br>
As already mentioned above, it is possible to treat all plants and their parts according to the invention. In a preferred embodiment, wild plant species and plant cultivars, or those obtained by conventional biological breeding methods, such as crossing or protoplast fusion, and parts thereof, are treated. In a further preferred embodiment, transgenic plants and plant cultivars obtained by genetic engineering methods, if appropriate in combination with conventional methods (Genetically Modified Organisms), and parts thereof are treated. The terms "parts", "parts of plants" and "plant parts" have been explained above.<br>
Particularly preferably, plants of the plant cultivars which are in each case commercially available or in use are treated according to the invention. Plant cultivars are to be understood as meaning plants having novel properties ("traits") which have been obtained by conventional breeding, by mutagenesis or by recombinant DMA techniques. These can be cultivars, bio- or genotypes.<br>
Depending on the plant species or plant cultivars, their location and growth conditions (soils, climate, vegetation period, diet), the treatment according to the invention may also result in superadditive ("synergistic") effects. Thus, for example, reduced application rates and/or a widening of the activity spectrum and/or an increase in the activity of the active compounds and compositions which can be used according to the invention, better plant growth, increased tolerance to high or low temperatures, increased tolerance to drought or to water or soil salt content, increased flowering performance, easier harvesting, accelerated maturation, higher harvest yields, higher quality and/or a higher nutritional value of the harvested products, better storage stability and/or processability of the harvested products are possible, which exceed the effects which were actually to be expected.<br>
The transgenic plants or plant cultivars (obtained by genetic engineering) which are preferably to be treated according to the invention include all plants which, by virtue of the genetic modification, received genetic material which imparted particularly advantageous, useful traits to these plants. Examples of such traits are better plant growth, increased tolerance to high or low temperatures, increased tolerance to drought or to water or soil salt content, increased flowering performance, easier harvesting, accelerated maturation, higher harvest yields, higher quality and/or a higher nutritional value of the harvested products, better storage stability and/or •processability of the harvested products. Further and particularly emphasized examples of such traits are a better defence of the plants against animal and microbial pests, such as against insects, mites, phytopathogenic fungi, bacteria and/or viruses, and also increased tolerance of the plants to certain herbicidally active compounds.<br>
Examples of transgenic plants which may be mentioned are the important crop plants, such as cereals (wheat, rice), maize, soya beans, potatoes, sugar beet, tomatoes, peas and other vegetable varieties, cotton, tobacco, oilseed rape and also fruit plants (with the fruits apples, pears, citrus fruits and grapes), and particular emphasis is given to maize, soya beans, potatoes, cotton, tobacco and oilseed rape. Traits that are emphasized are in particular increased defence of the plants against insects, arachnids, nematodes and slugs and snails by virtue of toxins formed in the plants, in particular those formed in the plants by the genetic material from Bacillus thuringiensis (for example by the genes CrylA(a), CrylA(b), CrylA(c), CryllA, CrylllA, CrylllB2, Cry9c, Cry2Ab, Cry3Bb and CrylF and also combinations thereof) (referred to hereinbelow as "Bt plants"). Traits that are also particularly emphasized are the increased defence of the plants against fungi, bacteria and viruses by systemic acquired resistance (SAP), systemin, phytoalexins, elicitors and resistance genes and correspondingly expressed proteins and toxins. Traits that are furthermore particularly emphasized are the increased tolerance of the plants to certain herbicidally active compounds, for example imidazolinones, sulphonylureas, glyphosate or phosphinotricin (for example the "PAT" gene). The genes which impart the desired traits in question can also be present in combination with one another in the transgenic plants. Examples of "Bt plants" which may be mentioned are maize varieties, cotton varieties, soya bean varieties and potato varieties which are sold under the trade names YIELD GARD® (for example maize, cotton, soya beans), KnockOut® (for example maize), StarLink® (for example maize), Bollgard® (cotton), Nucotn® (cotton) and NewLeaf® (potato). Examples of herbicide-tolerant plants which may be mentioned are maize varieties, cotton varieties and soya bean varieties which are sold under the trade names Roundup Ready® (tolerance to glyphosate, for example maize, cotton, soya bean), Liberty Link® (tolerance to phosphinotricin, for example oilseed rape), I Ml® (tolerance to imidazolinones) and STS® (tolerance to sulphonylureas, for example maize). Herbicide-resistant plants (plants bred in a conventional manner for herbicide tolerance) which may be mentioned include the varieties sold under the name Clearfield® (for example maize). Of course, these statements also apply to plant cultivars having these genetic traits or genetic traits still to be developed, which plant cultivars will be developed and/or marketed in the future.<br>
The plants listed can be treated according to the invention in a particularly advantageous manner with the active compounds of the general formula I according to the invention. The preferred ranges stated above for the active compounds also apply<br>
to the treatment of these plants. Particular emphasis is given to the treatment of plants with the active compounds specifically mentioned in the present text.<br>
In the field of household insecticides, the active compounds according to the invention are used alone or in combination with other suitable active compounds, such as phosphoric esters, carbamates, pyrethroids, neonicotinoids, growth regulators or active compounds from other known classes of insecticides.<br>
It has furthermore been found that the active compounds according to the invention also have a strong insecticidal action against insects which destroy industrial materials.<br>
The following insects may be mentioned as examples and as preferred - but without any limitation:<br>

In another embodiment of the invention, nodulisporic acid and its derivatives (a class of known acaricidal, anthelminitic, anti-parasitic and insecticidal agents) can be added to the compositions of the invention. These compounds are used to treat or prevent infections in humans and animals and are described, for example, in U.S. Patent No. 5,399,582 and 5,962,499. The composition can include one or more of the known nodulisporic acid derivatives in the art, including all stereoisomers, such as those described in the literature cited above.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, one or more macrocyclic lactones, which act as an acaricide, anthelmintic agent and insecticide, can be added to the compositions of the invention. The macrolides are well-known in the art (see e.g. Macrolides - Chemistry, pharmacology and clinical uses - edited by Bryskier et al., publ.. by Arnette Blackwell, (1993)) and include but are not limited to 12-membered ring macrolides (e.g. methymycin, neomethymycin, YC-17, litorin); 14-membered ring macrolides (e.g. erythromycin A-F, oleandomycin, sporeamicin, roxithromycin, dirithromycin, flurithromycin, clarithromycin, davercin); 15-membered ring macrolides (e.g. azithromycin); 16-membered ring macrolides (e.g. josamycin, kitasamycin, spiramycin, midecamycin, rokitamycin, miokamicin) and 17-membered ring macrolides (e.g. lankadicin).<br>

Also included are the 5-oxo and 5-oxime derivatives of said avermectins and milbemycins. Examples of combinations of arylpyrazole compounds with macrocyclic lactones include but are not limited to those described in U.S. Patent Nos. 6,426,333; 6,482,425; 6,962,713 and 6,998,131 - each assigned to Merial, Ltd., Duluth, GA.<br>
The macrocyclic lactone compounds are known in the art and can easily be obtained commercially or through synthesis techniques known in the art. Reference is<br>
made to the widely available technical and commercial literature. For avermectins, ivermectin and abamectin, reference may be made, for example, to the work "Ivermectin and Abamectin", 1989, by M.H. Fischer and H. Mrozik, William C. Campbell, published by Springer Verlag., or Albers-Schonberg et al. (1981), "Avermectins Structure Determination", J. Am. Chem. Soc., 103, 4216-4221. For doramectin, "Veterinary Parasitology", vol: 49, No. 1, July 1993, 5-15 may be consulted. For milbemycins, reference may be made, inter alia, to Davies H.G. et al., 1986, "Avermectins and Milbemycins", Nat. Prod. Rep., 3, 87-121, Mrozik H. et al., 1983, Synthesis of Milbemycins from Avermectins, Tetrahedron Lett., 24, 5333-5336, U.S. Patent No. 4,134,973 and EP 0 677 054.<br>
Macrocyclic lactones are either natural products or are semi-synthetic derivatives thereof. The structure of the avermectins and milbemycins are closely related, e.g., by sharing a complex 16-membered macrocyclic lactone ring; milbemycins lack the glycosidic moiety of the avermectins. The natural product avermectins are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,310,519 to Albers-Schonberg et al., and the 22,23-dihydro avermectin compounds are disclosed in Chabala et al., U.S. Patent No. 4,199,569. Mention is also made of Kitano, U.S. Patent No. 4,468,390, Beuvry et al., U.S. Patent No. 5,824,653, EP 0 007 812 A1, U.K. Patent Specification 1 390 336, EP 0 002 916, and Ancare New Zealand Patent No. 237 086, inter alia. Naturally occurring milbemycins are described in Aoki et al., U.S. Patent No. 3,950,360 as well as in the various references cited in "The Merck Index" 12th ed., S. Budavari, Ed., Merck &amp; Co., Inc. Whitehouse Station, New Jersey (1996). Latidectin is described in the "International Nonproprietary Names for Pharmaceutical Substances (INN)", WHO Drug Information, vol. 17, no. 4, pp. 263- 286, (2003). Semisynthetic derivatives of these classes of compounds are well known in the art and are described, for example, in U.S. Patent No. 5,077,308, U.S. Patent No. 4,859,657, U.S. Patent No. 4,963,582, U.S. Patent No. 4,855,317, U.S. Patent No. 4,871,719, U.S. Patent No. 4,874,749, U.S. Patent No. 4,427,663, U.S. Patent No. 4,310,519, U.S. Patent No. 4,199,569, U.S. Patent No. 5,055,596, U.S. Patent No. 4,973,711, U.S. Patent No. 4,978,677, U.S. Patent No. 4,920,148 and EP 0 667 054.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the class of acaricides or insecticides known as insect growth regulators (IGRs) can also be added to the compositions of the invention. Compounds belonging to this group are well known to the practitioner and represent a wide range of different chemical classes. These compounds all act by interfering with the development or growth of the insect pests. Insect growth regulators are described, for example, in U.S. Patent No. 3,748,356; U.S. Patent No. 3,818,047;<br>
U.S. Patent No. 4,225,598; U.S. Patent No. 4,798,837; U.S. Patent No. 4,751,225, EP 0 179 022 or U.K. 2 140 010 as well as U.S. Patent Nos. 6,096,329 and 6,685,954 (both assigned to Merial Ltd., Duluth, GA). Examples of IGRs suitable for use include but are not limited to methoprene, pyriproxyfen, hydroprene, cyromazine, fluazuron, lufenuron, novaluron, pyrethroids, formamidines and 1-(2, 6-difluorobenzoyl)-3-(2-fluoro-4-(trifluoromethyl)phenylurea.<br>
An anthelmintic agent that can be combined with the compound of the invention to form a composition can be a benzenedisulfonamide compound, which includes but is not limited to clorsulon; or a cestodal agent, which includes but is not limited to praziquantel, pyrantel or morantel.<br>
An antiparasitic agent that can be combined with the compound of the invention to form a composition can be a biologically active peptide or protein including, but not limited to, depsipeptides, which act at the neuromuscular junction by stimulating presynaptic receptors belonging to the secretin receptor family resulting in the paralysis and death of parasites. In one embodiment of the depsipeptide, the depsipeptide is emodepside.<br>
An insecticidal agent that can be combined with the compound of the invention to form a composition can be a spinosyn (e.g. spinosad) or a substituted pyridylmethyl derivative compound such as imidacloprid. Agents of this class are described above, and for example, in U.S. Patent No. 4,742,060 or in EP 0 892 060. It would be well within the skill level of the practitioner to decide which individual compound can be used in the inventive formulation to treat a particular infection of an insect.<br>
An insecticidal agent that can be combined with the compound of the invention to form a composition can be a semicarbazone, such as metaflumizone (BAS3201). Metaflumizone is a relatively safe compound (oral LD50 &gt; 5,000 mg/kg) with known activity on various Lepidoptera crop pest species.<br>
Where appropriate the anthelmintic, antiparasitic and insecticial agent may also be selected from the group of compounds described above as suitable for agrochemical use.<br>
In general, the additional pesticidal agent is included in a dose of between about 0.1 ng and about 10 mg. In one embodiment of the invention, the additional pesticidal agent is included in a dose of between about 1 (ig and about 10 mg. In another embodiment of the invention, the additional pesticidal agent is included in a dose of about 5 to about 200 |ig/kg of weight of animal. In yet another embodiment of the invention, the additional pesticidal agent is included in a dose between about 0.1 to<br>
about 10 mg/kg of weight of animal.   In still another embodiment of the invention, the additional pesticidal agent is included in a dose between about 0.5 to 50 mg/kg.<br>
The proportions, by weight, of the 1-aryl-5-alkyl pyrazole compound and the additional pesticidal agent are for example between about 5/1 and about 10,000/1. However, one of ordinary skill in the art would be able to select the appropriate ratio of 1-aryl-5-alkyl pyrazole compound and the additional pesticidal agent for the intended host and use thereof. Method of Synthesizing the Compounds of the Invention<br>
The compounds of formula (I) may be prepared by the application or adaptation of known methods (i.e. methods heretofore used or described in the chemical literature): generally pyrazole ring formation followed where necessary by changing substituents; or methods described in one or more of WO 98/28278 (U.S. Patent 6,350,771), WO 87/03781 (U.S. Patent 5,232,940) and EP 780 378 (U.S. Patent 5,817,688). It will be appreciated by persons skilled in the art that, within aspect of the processes described; the order of the synthetic steps employed may be varied and will depend inter alia on factors such as the nature of other functional groups present in a particular substrate, the availability of key intermediates, and the protecting group strategy (if any) to be adopted (see e.g. "Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis (Third Edition)", eds. Greene and Wuts, Wiley-lnterscience, (1999)). Clearly, such factors will also influence the choice of reagents for use in the said synthetic steps.<br>

In one embodiment of the process, the hydride agent is sodium borohydride. The reaction may be performed in a solvent such as dialkyl ether (e.g. diethyl ether), tetrahydrofuran (THF), or a hydrocarbon (e.g. hexane or toluene) or mixtures thereof. A temperature of from about -100 to about the reflux temperature of the solvent system is generally used. In one embodiment of the process, the temperature is between about 0°C to about room temperature. A summary of such methods is found in Comprehensive Organic Transformations, VCH Publishers, 1989, R.C. Larock, pp.527-535.

Chem., 1977, 42 (14), 2431. Those skilled in the art will recognize this as a Meerwein arylation reaction, as reviewed in Org. React, 1976, 24, 225-259. The process is generally carried out in a mixture of the olefin and a common organic solvent, such as acetonitrile and at a temperature from about -50 and about 100°C. In one embodiment of the process, the temperature is about room temperature.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) in which R3 is replaced by NH2 may be prepared by methods described in one or more of the following: WO 94/21606, WO 93/06089, WO 87/03781; EP 295 117, EP 234 119; U.S. Patent Number 5,232,940; or by methods known to the skilled in the art.

If appropriate, they can also be employed as intermediates or precursors for the synthesis of other active compounds.<br>
In another embodiment this aspect of the invention, the compounds and compositions of the invention are suitable for controlling pests such as insects selected from the group consisting of Blatella germanica, Heliothis virescens, Leptinotarsa decemlineata, Tetramorium caespitum and combinations thereof.<br>
In each aspect of the invention, the compounds and compositions of the invention can be applied against a single pest or combinations thereof.<br>
The composition containing the 1 -aryl-5-alkyl pyrazole of the invention may be administered continuously, for treatment or prophylaxis, by known methods. Generally, a dose of from about 0.001 to about 50 mg per kg of body weight given as a single dose or in divided doses for a period of from 1 to 5 days will be satisfactory but, of course, there can be instances where higher or lower dosage ranges are indicated, and such are within the scope of this invention. It is well within the routine skill of the practitioner to determine a particular dosing regimen for a specific host and parasite.<br>
In one treatment embodiment, the treatment is carried out so as to administer to the animal, on a single occasion, a dose containing between about 0.001 and about 100 mg/kg of a 1-aryl-5-alkyl pyrazole compound or between about 0.1 and about 200 µg/kg or about 100 µg/kg of compound. In another treatment embodiment, the treatment is via a direct topical administration such as a paste, pour-on, ready-to-use, spot-on, etc. type formulation. Higher amounts may be provided for very prolonged release in or on the body of the animal. In another treatment embodiment, the amount of 1-aryl-5-alkyl pyrazole compound for birds and animals which are small in size is<br>
greater than about 0.01 mg, and in another embodiment for the treatment of small sized birds and animals, the amount of 1 -aryl-5-alkyl pyrazole compound is between about 1 and about 100 mg/kg of weight of animal.<br>
The solutions according to the invention may be applied using any means known per se, e.g. using an applicator gun or a metering flask.<br>
This method serves to cleanse the skin and the hairs of the animals by eliminating the parasites which are present thereon, as well as their residues and dejections. The result of this is that the animals are no longer stressed by the parasites and their bites, this having positive consequences, for example on their growth and on the use of their food ration.<br>
In one embodiment, a direct pour-on skin formulation according to the present invention can provide long-lasting and broad-spectrum efficacy when the solution is applied to the animal's back, e.g. along the line of the back at one or more points.<br>
According to a first embodiment for administering direct pour-on formulations, the process comprises applying the solution to the animals, the application being repeated every month or every two months.<br>
According to a second embodiment for administering direct pour-on formulation, the process comprises applying the solution to livestock animals before they arrive in the Feed Lot, it being possible for this application to be the final one before the animals are slaughtered.<br>
Obviously, the process may also consist in combining these two embodiments, namely the first followed by the second.<br>
In another embodiment, the compounds of the invention are administered in spot-on formulations. While not wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that these formulations work by dissolution of the dose in the natural oils of the host's skin, fur or feathers. From there, the active agent(s) distribute around the host's body through the sebaceous glands of the skin. The therapeutic agent also remains in the sebaceous glands. Thus, the glands provide a natural reservoir for the active agent that allows for the agent to be drained back out to the follicles to reapply itself to the skin and hair. This, in turn, provides for longer time periods between application as well as eliminating the need to re-administer the dose after the host becomes wet because of rain, bathes, etc. The inventive formulation has the further advantage of not being directly deposited on the skin or fur, where self-grooming animals could orally ingest the therapeutic agent, thereby becoming sick or possibly interacting with other therapeutic agent being orally administered.<br>
In one embodiment of the location of administration, a single formulation containing the active agent in a substantially liquid carrier and in a form which makes possible a single application, or an application repeated a small number of times, will be administered to the animal over a localized region of the animal, e.g. between the two shoulders. In one embodiment of the invention, the localized region has a surface area of about 10 cm2 or larger. In another embodiment of the invention, the localized region has a surface are of between about 5 and about 10 cm2area.<br>
The invention is further described by the following non-limiting examples which further illustrate the invention, and are not intended, nor should they be interpreted to, limit the scope of the invention.<br>
EXAMPLES Preparation Examples<br>
All temperatures are given in degrees Centigrade; room temperature means 20 to 25°C. Reagents were purchased from commercial sources or prepared following literature procedures.<br>
Unless otherwise noted, purification by reverse phase column chromatography was performed by dissolving the crude residue in a small volume of DMSO and filtering through a 0.45 micron (nylon disc) syringe filter. The solution was then purified on an HPLC purification system managed by the Chromeleon™ software using a 50 mm Varian Dynamax HPLC 21.4 mm Microsorb Guard-8 C8 column. The initial MeOH:H2O solvent mixture was selected as appropriate for the target compound. This initial mixture was maintained for 0.5 minutes then changed by a linear gradient to a final concentration of 100% MeOH over 5 minutes. 100% MeOH was maintained for 2 more minutes. Total run time was 8 minutes. The resulting fractions were analyzed, combined as appropriate, and then evaporated to provide purified material.<br>
Proton and fluorine magnetic resonance (respectively 1H NMR and 19F NMR) spectra were recorded on a Varian INOVA NMR spectrometer [400 MHz (1H) and 377 MHz (19F)]. All spectra were determined in the solvents indicated. Chemical shifts are reported in ppm downfield of tetramethylsilane (TMS), referenced to the residual proton peak of the respective solvent peak for 1H NMR. Interproton coupling contants are reported in Hertz (Hz). LC-MS spectra were obtained using a Thermofinnigan AQA MS ESI instrument, using a Phenomenex Aqua 5 micron C18 125A 50 x 4.60 mm column and a linear gradient from 55% MeOH: 1% CH3CN in H2O to 100% MeOH over 3 minutes. 100% MeOH was maintained for 2 minutes. Melting points were determined using a Thomas Hoover capillary melting point apparatus and are uncorrected.<br>
