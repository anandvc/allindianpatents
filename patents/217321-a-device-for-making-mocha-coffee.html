Mocha coffee is prepared in a cooking container by cooking with water, wherein mocha coffee flour is added to the water. An electrically operated mocha coffee machine is known from the flyer Elektronic Sanyai S.A. for the preparation of Turkish Mocha Coffee, wherein the electrically operated mocha coffee machine prepares Turkish Mocha Coffee out of water, mocha coffee flour and sugar. The known mocha coffee machine is associated with the disadvantage that the cooking container for the Turkish mocha coffee is subject to line voltage, and whereby the operation of the known mocha coffee machine is associated with a substantial danger for life and limb because of a possible current blow stroke.<br>
It is in object of the present invention to further develop a device of the initially recited kind such that the device enables operationally safe and substantially automatic the preparation of a Turkish, foaming mocha coffee.<br>
The object is accomplished according to the present invention by the features recited in the claims 1 and 10.<br>
The present invention exhibits relative to what is known the advantages that an operationally safe device for the preparation of Turkish mocha coffee is<br>
available under compact construction, wherein the operationally safe device does not require any attention until the finishing of the mocha coffee, because the operationally safe device prepares the mocha coffee substantially automatically.<br>
Further advantageous embodiments of the invention result from the sub claims and the following description.<br>

The electrical conduits as well as the water hoses are not shown in the drawings for purposes of clarity of the presentation in the drawings.<br>
MODE OF OPERATION<br>
If mocha coffee is to be prepared with the differently constructed embodiment of the present invention described by way of the figs. 2 through 9, that is the device 201, then the power grid switch 257 (figs.2,3, 4) is switched on, whereby the control unit 210 (figs. 2,3, 6) receives current (from a power grid not illustrated in the drawings).<br>
The control unit 210 initiates the lifting device 239 by placing the electric motor 250 under electrical current. The gear wheel 248 (figure 4) is placed thereby immediately or through a further gear wheel drive in a suitable rotation direction in rotation, wherein the gear wheel 248 moves upwardly at the gear rack 246. The gear wheel 248 carries along the axis 243, wherein the axis 243 is guided in the two slots 244, 245. Also the gear wheel 249 disposed engaged with the gear rack 247, serves for guiding. The axis or axle 243 carries the base plate 240 along, whereby the cooking container 202 also is transported together upwardly, and in fact to such extent until the temperature sensor 211 and the stirrer rod 203 with its stirrer blade 204 immerse far into the cooking vessel 202.<br>
Now water is filled from the water tank 233 into the cooking vessel 202, mocha coffee flour and sugar are transferred by hand from the receivers 231, 232 through the opening 238 into the cooking vessel. The control unit switches the heating body on, the mocha coffee is prepared, wherein the temperature of the mocha coffee is measured through the temperature sensor 211 and is delivered to the control unit 210 and the mocha coffee is stirred with the aid of the stirrer rod 203.<br>
The heating body is switched off by the control unit 210 and stirrer rod 203 is set to rest after a pre-determined time duration. The control unit switches the electric motor 250 on with inverted direction of rotation, whereby the lifting device 239 moves downward together with the cooking vessel 202. The axle 243 rests at the ends of the slots 244, 245 after received at the bottom, whereby a worm gear engaging with the gear wheel 248 and being further driven by the electric motor 250 rises upward at the gear wheel 248. The base plate 240 is thereby flipped, according to the embodiment of the present invention by 95 degrees, and in fact such that the finished mocha coffee can flow into the drinking vessel 230. The base plate 240 returns into its starting position control by a program after emptying of the cooking vessel 202, and a new sequence of operation for the preparation of mocha coffee can be started from the starting position of the base plate 240.<br>
According to another embodiment (not illustrated in the drawings) of the present invention, the cooking vessel is disposed at the bottom above the heating body in the device, wherein agents disposed on the lifting device, that is stirrer rod with a stirrer blade, a drive motor for the stirrer rod as well as a temperature sensor in each case are lowered downwardly into the cooking vessel for the purpose of preparation of the mocha coffee and are again moved backwardly upwards after preparation of the mocha coffee.<br>
The bars or spars 251, 252 (figs. 3, 4) are preferably formed as U-rails, which serve to support a cup blockage 258 (figure 10). The latter cup blockage 258 has a lower arc shaped guide part 259 for positioning of a drinking vessel 230 on the perforated plate 229 (figs. 3, 4) and in addition a transparent plate 260, wherein the pouring of the mocha coffee into the drinking vessel 230 can be observed through the transparent plate 260.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
