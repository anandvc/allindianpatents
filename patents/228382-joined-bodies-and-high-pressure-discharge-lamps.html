				<td>JOINED BODIES AND HIGH-PRESSURE DISCHARGE LAMPS<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the invention<br>
[0001] The present invention relates to a joined body, particularly relates to a<br>
high pressure discharge lamp using a ceramic discharge tube.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
[0002] A high pressure discharge lamp has a ceramic discharge tube with<br>
two end portions, in which sealing members (usually referred to as a ceramic<br>
plug) are inserted, respectively, to seal the respective end portions. A through<br>
hole is formed in each sealing member and a metal member, to which a<br>
predetermined electrode system is attached, is inserted within the through hole.<br>
An ionizable light-emitting material is introduced and sealed within the inner<br>
space of the discharge tube. Known high pressure discharge lamps include a<br>
high pressure sodium vapor and metal halide lamps, the latter exhibiting more<br>
superior color coordination. The lamp may be used in high temperature<br>
condition by forming the discharge tube by a ceramic material.<br>
[0003] In such discharge lamp, it is necessary to air-tightly seal between the<br>
end portion of the ceramic discharge tube and a member for supporting an<br>
electrode system. The ceramic discharge tube has a main body with a shape of<br>
a tube with two narrow ends, or a barrel, or a straight tube. The ceramic<br>
discharge tube is made of, for example, alumina sintered body.<br>
[0004] Specification of Japanese patent application No. 178,415/1999 (EPO<br>
EP0982278, A1) discloses the following structure. The joining portion between<br>
the end portion of a ceramic discharge tube and a member for supporting an<br>
electrode system comprises main phase contacting the discharge tube, and an<br>
intermediate ceramic layer contacting the supporting member and existing<br>
between the supporting member and the main phase. The main phase is<br>
composed of a porous bone structure, with open pores and made of a sintered<br>
product of metal powder, and ceramic phase impregnated into the open pores in<br>
said porous bone structure. Herewith, such joined structure has improved air-<br>
tightness and resistance to corrosion, and repeated thermal cycles does not result<br>
in the fracture of the joined structure.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0005] The inventor further examined the above sealing structure and,<br>
therefore, achieved to provide a joined structure having resistance to fatigue and<br>
fracture, even when the structure is subjected to repeated thermal cycles between<br>
a high temperature, for example 1000°C or higher, and room temperature.<br>
[0006] That is, it is an object of the invention to provide a joined structure<br>
having resistance to fatigue and fracture, even when the structure is subjected to<br>
repeated thermal cycles between a high temperature, for example 1000°C or<br>
higher, and room temperature.<br>
[0007] It is another object of the invention to apply such joined structure to a<br>
high pressure discharge lamp, for improving the resistance to a corrosive gas,<br>
such as a metal halide, and the air-tightness and for avoiding the fracture of the<br>
joined structure due to repeated cycles of turning-ons and turning-offs.<br>
[0008] The present invention provides a joined body of a first member made<br>
of a metal and a second member made of a ceramic or a cermet. The joined<br>
body comprises a joining portion interposed between the first member and the<br>
second member for joining the first and second members, wherein the joining<br>
portion comprises main phase contacting the first member and an intermediate<br>
ceramic composition layer contacting the second member and existing between<br>
the second member and the main phase. The main phase is composed of a<br>
porous bone structure, made of a sintered product of metal powder and with open<br>
pores, and ceramic composition layer impregnated into the open pores in the<br>
porous bone structure. Each of the intermediate ceramic composition layer and<br>
said impregnated ceramic composition layer has a crystallinity of more than 50%.<br>
[0009] The present invention further provides a ceramic discharge lamp<br>
comprising:<br>
a ceramic discharge tube with an inner space formed therein and end<br>
portions, the inner space being filled with an ionizable light-emitting material<br>
and a starter gas and an opening being formed within the end portion;<br>

a sealing member with a through hole formed therein, a part of the sealing<br>
member being fixed within the opening of the ceramic discharge tube; and<br>
a metal member; wherein the metal member and the sealing member<br><br>
constitute the above air-tight joined body. The metal member is the first<br>
member and the sealing member is the second member.<br>
[0010] The present invention further provides a ceramic discharge lamp<br>
comprising:<br>
a ceramic discharge tube with an inner space formed therein and end<br>
portions, the inner space being filled with an ionizable light-emitting material<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0013] Figures 1 to 7 are cross sectional views showing an end portion of a<br>
high pressure discharge lamp of the invention.<br>
[0014] An inner wall surface 1b of an end portion 1a of a ceramic high<br>
pressure discharge tube 1 is formed so as to extend straightforwardly in the<br>
direction of the central axis of the tube. A part of a sealing member 4 is<br>
inserted within an opening 40 of the end portion 1a. 4c is an outer surface and<br>
46 is a through hole of the sealing member 4.<br>
[0015] A depression or hollow 9 is formed on the inner wall surface 4a of the<br>
sealing member 4. A metal member 7 is held in the hollow 9. In the<br>
embodiment, the metal member 7 has a shape of a tube and an opening is formed<br>
in its end portion 7d, the opening being sealed after introducing a starter gas and<br>
an ionizable light-emitting substance. 7b is an inner surface and 7c is an outer<br>
surface of the metal member 7. An inner space of the metal member 7 is<br>
commuted with an inner space of the ceramic discharge tube 1 (described below).<br>
A protrusion 42 is provided in the sealing member 4 and faces an end portion 7a<br>
of the metal member 7.<br>
[0016] As shown in figure 1, the inventors provided a porous bone structure<br>
2, made of a sintered product of metal powder and with open pores, between the<br>
metal member 7 and sealing member 4. A ceramic material ring was then<br>
positioned on the bone structure 2. The melting point of the bone structure 2 is<br>
adjusted so as to exceed that of the ceramic material.<br><br>
[0017] When the ceramic material was melted, as schematically shown in<br>
figure 2, the inventor found that the melted material was impregnated into the<br>
open pores to form main phase 14, comprising the porous bone structure and<br>
ceramic composition layer impregnated into the open pores. The inventor<br>
further found that the thus melted material is flown into the interface of the<br>
sealing member 4 and the main phase 14 so that the bone structure is slightly<br>
floated from the surface of the sealing member 4 to form the intermediate<br>
ceramic composition layer 13. The main phase 14 and intermediate ceramic<br>
composition layer 13 together form a joining portion 6 joining the metal member<br>
7 and sealing member 4. 41 is a joint interface of the sealing member 4.<br>
The joining portion 6 extends to the region near the protrusion 42. A joining<br>
ceramic composition layer 48 is formed between the protrusion 42 and the end<br>
portion 7a of the metal member 7.<br>
[0018] As shown in Figure 3, it is also possible to apply a paste ceramic<br>
composition 20' at the peripheral of the metal member 7, the bone structure 2<br>
and the sealing member 4 instead of positioning the ceramic material ring 20 on<br>
the bone structure 2.<br>
[0019] Such structure will be explained referring to scanning type<br>
microscopic photographs of figures 4 and 5, and line diagrams of figures 6 and 7.<br>
Figure 4 is a photograph showing the region near the interface between the metal<br>
member 7 and the sealing member 4, and figure 6 is a diagram illustrating the<br>
photograph of figure 4. Figure 5 is an enlarged view showing the photograph of<br>
figure 4, and figure 7 is a diagram illustrating the photograph of figure 5.<br>
[0020] The intermediate ceramic composition layer 13 and main phase 14 is<br>
formed on the surface of the sealing member 4. The main phase 14 is<br>
composed of the bone structure 15 and the ceramic composition layer 10<br>
impregnated into open pores of the bone structure 15. The intermediate<br>
ceramic composition layer 13 is composed of the same composition as the<br>
impregnated ceramic composition layer 10. The main phase 14 of the joining<br>
portion 6 is formed on the surface of the metal member 7. In the photograph of<br>
the figure 4, the whitish region in the main phase 14 is metallic molybdenum,<br>
and gray or black region in the main phase 14 is the impregnated ceramic<br>
composition layer. The difference of the brightness in the impregnated ceramic<br><br>
phase shows that the ratio of the components in the ceramic, such as alumina,<br>
has been changed microscopically.<br>
[0021] In the joined body having the above structure, tensile stresses on the<br>
ceramic is dispersed by means of metal particles (porous bone structure) and<br>
compression stress on the bone structure is dispersed by means of the ceramic<br>
impregnated into its open pores. That is, the different kinds of materials may<br>
cooperate with each other to cope with both of the tensile and compression<br>
stresses on the joining portion. Further, it is relatively hard to generate cracks<br>
in the ceramic materials. In addition, when cracks develop within the ceramic<br>
composition layer, such cracks may be interrupted by the porous bone structure<br>
made of a metal, thereby preventing the fracture of the joining portion. Further,<br>
such main phase comprising the porous bone structure and impregnated ceramic<br>
composition layer adheres to the metal member and the intermediate ceramic<br>
composition layer strongly adhere to the sealing member.<br>
[0022] Further, ceramic components susceptible to corrosion is mainly<br>
impregnated into the open pores of the bone structure.<br>
[0023] According to the present invention, it is found that there are the<br>
thermal stress factor and the corrosion factor in the failure mechanism of the<br>
high pressure discharge lamp. It is also found that there are the temperature<br>
region in which the thermal stress factor is dominant and the temperature region<br>
in which the corrosion factor is dominant. Figure 8 is a diagram showing the<br>
relation among the heat resisting temperature, the thermal stress, and the<br>
corrosion resistance of the high pressure discharge lamp. As shown in figure 8,<br>
the thermal stress factor is dominant at the heat resisting temperature lower than<br>
980°C, preferably equal to or lower than 950°C, and the corrosion factor is<br>
dominant at the heat resisting temperature higher than 980°C, preferably equal to<br>
or lower than 1050°C. According to the inventor's investigation, it is<br>
advantageous for the high pressure discharge lamp to have not less than 50% of<br>
the crystallinity in view of the corrosion.<br>
[0024] The above mentioned phenomenon can be explained as follows. It is<br>
thought that the thermal stress is proportional to the difference between the real<br>
temperature and the melting point (the softening temperature) of the object.<br>
Therefore, as shown by curve a in figure 8, the contribution to the thermal stress<br><br>
decreases as the heat resisting temperature increases. A substantia] thermal<br>
stress does not occur at the temperature equal to or higher than melting point.<br>
[0025] On the other hand, as shown by curve b in figure 8, the corrosion (the<br>
chemical reaction) decreases as the heat resisting temperature decreases. This<br>
is because the activity of an ionizable light-emitting material filled into the<br>
discharge tube decreases as the temperature of the discharge tube and thus<br>
attacks to the inner wall of the discharge tube and so on decreases. Therefore,<br>
at a relatively high temperature, the chemical stabilization of the high pressure<br>
discharge lamp increases as the rate of the crystallinity increases.<br>
[0026] When the thermal cycle test of the ceramic discharge tube is<br>
performed at the 950°C of the temperature in which the thermal stress is<br>
dominant in the failure mechanism of the high pressure discharge lamp, the<br>
stress relaxation mechanism fully acts and the corrosion is relatively low on<br>
condition that the intermediate ceramic composition layer and the impregnated<br>
ceramic composition layer of the high pressure discharge lamp has a crystallinity<br>
of not more than 50%. This is because the thermal stress is dominant in the<br>
failure mechanism of the high pressure discharge lamp when the crystallinity is<br>
not more than 50%. As a result, the failure of the high pressure discharge lamp<br>
does not occur. On the other hand, it is not advantageous for the high pressure<br>
discharge lamp to have not less than 50% of the crystallinity because the stress<br>
relaxation mechanism does not fully act. (refer to figure 9) In the thermal<br>
cycle test, 1000 times of the thermal cycles was performed. In this case, the<br>
temperature of the high pressure discharge lamp was firstly maintained at the<br>
room temperature for 15 minutes, subsequently was increased to 1050°C and<br>
maintained at 1050°C for 5 minutes, and finally was decreased to the room<br>
temperature every thermal cycle.<br>
[0027] When the thermal cycle test of the ceramic discharge tube is<br>
performed at the 1050°C of the temperature in which the corrosion is dominant<br>
in the failure mechanism of the high pressure discharge lamp, the corrosion<br>
resistance fully acts and the thermal stress is relatively low on condition that the<br>
intermediate ceramic composition layer and the impregnated ceramic<br>
composition layer of the high pressure discharge lamp has a crystallinity of more<br>
than 50%. As a result, the failure of the high pressure discharge lamp does not<br><br>
occur. On the other hand, it is not advantageous for the high pressure discharge<br>
lamp to have not more than 50% of the crystallinity because the corrosion<br>
resistance does not fully act. (refer to figure 10)<br>
[0028] The following table shows the result in which cubes were arranged<br>
into a quarts tube and exposed to DyI3 and ScI3 for 4000 hours at the temperature<br>
of 950°C. Each of the cubes has 5 mm of sides and is composed of ceramic<br>
compositions of 46%, 54% and 75 a% of the crystallinity.<br>
Table 1<br><br>
[0029] As already stated, when the heat resisting temperature is higher than<br>
980°C, or the crystallinity is more than 50%, the contribution to the corrosion<br>
resistance is higher than that to the relaxation of the thermal stress. On the<br>
other hand, when the heat resisting temperature is lower than 980°C, or the<br>
crystallinity is less than 50%, the contribution to the relaxation of the thermal<br>
stress is higher than that to the corrosion resistance. However, If the ionizable<br>
light-emitting material contains a main component of a rare earth metal halide, it<br>
is prefer to have more than 50% of the crystallinity regardless of the heat<br>
resisting temperature because the contribution to the corrosion is relatively high<br>
at the temperature lower than 980°C due to the high corrosion thereof. The<br>
"main component" herein means a component of an ionizable light-emitting<br>
material occupying not less than 15 weight percent of the ionizable light-emitting<br>
material except for a starting medium.<br>
[0030] According to the present invention, the heat resisting temperature is<br>
1050°C if the crystallinity is 55%. As a result, the present invention can be<br>
applied to not only a lamp for general lighting but also a head lamp for vehicle<br>
which requires the relatively high heat resisting temperature not less than<br><br>
1000°C and a severe heat resisting cycle.<br>
[0031] The joined body in the present invention is particularly suitable to a<br>
high discharge lamp. In this case, such high pressure discharge lamp may be<br>
extremely stable to repeated cycles of turning-on and turning-off and a corrosive<br>
gas contained within the inner space of a ceramic discharge tube.<br>
[0032] In the invention, preferably, an intermediate ceramic composition<br>
layer and impregnated ceramic composition layer have the substantially same<br>
kind of composition. This means that both belong to the same ingredient<br>
system as a whole, thereby improving the strength of the joining portion.<br>
The intermediate ceramic composition layer and the impregnated ceramic<br>
composition layer further preferably have substantially same composition. This<br>
means that the intermediate ceramic composition layer and the impregnated<br>
ceramic composition layer are derived from the same material.<br>
[0033] The degree of crystallization of the intermediate ceramic composition<br>
layer and the impregnated ceramic composition layer is not limited, but may<br>
preferably be 80% or more. In such a case, the maximum degree is not limited,<br>
and may be 100%.<br>
[0034] In order to examine the relation between the rate of the crystallinity<br>
and that of the corrosion, cubes were arranged into a quarts tube and exposed to<br>
DyI3 and ScI3 for at the temperature of 1000°C, each of the cubes having 5 mm<br>
of sides and being composed of ceramic compositions of 60%), 70% and 80% of<br>
the crystallinity. The result shows as follows.<br><br>
[0035] As shown in table 2, the corrosion increases as the rate of the<br>
crystallinity increases. In other words, the corrosion at 70% of the crystallinity<br>
Table 2<br><br>
is higher than that at 60% of the crystallinity, and the corrosion at 80% of the<br>
crystallinity is higher than that at 70% of the crystallinity. Especially, when the<br>
crystallinity is 80%, the corrosion can be not more than 20% even if the time to<br>
expose the cube reaches 6000 hours.<br>
[0036] Each of ceramic constituting the intermediate ceramic composition<br>
layer and ceramic constituting the impregnated ceramic composition layer may<br>
preferably comprise one or more oxide selected from the group consisting of<br>
A12O3, Sc2O3, Y2O3, La2O3, Gd2O3, Dy2O3, H2O3, Tm2O3, SiO2, MoO2 and MoO3<br>
The mixture of not less than two of the oxides may be particularly preferable.<br>
Dy2O3-Al2O3, Sc2O3-Al2O3 two eutectic component is more preferable because it<br>
has substantially high melting point of the order of 1800°C.<br>
[0037] To prevent corrosion caused by the corrosive gas contained within the<br>
high pressure discharge lamp over a long term, the composition of SiO2 in each<br>
ceramic, which is a relatively corrosive ingredient, may preferably be 15 weight<br>
percent or less, and more preferably 5 weight percent or less. As a result, it is<br>
possible to control the crystallinity of the ceramics well. Figure 11 is a diagram<br>
showing the relation between the weight% of SiO2 and the crystallinity of a<br>
ceramics. It shows the relation when it takes 15 minutes to decrease 500°C<br>
from the treatment temperature. As shown in figure 11, the crystallinity is not<br>
less than 50% when a content of SiO2 of ceramics is less than 15 weight percent.<br>
[0038] SiO2 also act as a kind of binder to retain a shape of the ceramic<br>
material when this joined body is produced. Therefore, on the view of<br>
improving the shape retaining character, SiO2 may preferably be contained 5ppm<br>
or more, and more preferably 20ppm or more.<br>
[0039] Each ceramic may preferably contain particularly A12O3. On the<br>
view point of wettability, each ceramic may preferably contain a main<br>
component of the ceramic or cermet constituting the second member. The<br>
"main component" herein means a ceramic component constituting 70 weight<br>
percent or more of the ceramic or a ceramic component constituting 60 weight<br>
percent or more of the cermet.<br>
[0040] The followings are the preferred composition ranges.<br>
(1) A12O3	10 to 80 weight percent<br>
Si2O2	10 weight percent or less (preferably 5ppm or more)<br><br>
Y2O3	0 to 40 weight percent<br>
Dy2O3 0 to 50 weight percent<br>
B2O3	0 to 10 weight percent<br>
MoO3	0 to 10 weight percent<br>
(2) Al2O3	10 to 80 weight percent<br>
SiO2	0 to 10 weight percent<br>
Y2O3	10 to 25 weight percent<br>
Dy2O3	10 to 50 weight percent<br>
[0041] The metal member may be made of one or more metal selected from<br>
the group consisting of molybdenum, tungsten, rhenium, niobium, tantalum and<br>
alloys thereof.<br>
[0042] Among them, niobium and tantalum have thermal expansion<br>
coefficients matching with that of a ceramic, especially alumina ceramic,<br>
constituting a ceramic discharge tube. However, it is known that niobium and<br>
tantalum are susceptible to corrosion to a metal halide. Therefore, it is<br>
desirable to form a metal member by a metal selected from the group consisting<br>
of molybdenum, tungsten, rhenium and alloys thereof, for improving the life of<br>
the metal member. However, such metals, with high resistance to a metal<br>
halide, generally have a low thermal expansion coefficient. For example,<br>
alumina ceramic has a thermal expansion coefficient of 8x10-6KT-1 molybdenum<br>
has that of 6x10-6K-1 and tungsten and rhenium have those of not more than<br>
6x10-6K-1. In such a case, as described above, the inventive joined structure<br>
effectively reduces the stress due to the difference of the thermal expansion<br>
coefficients of the metal member and the ceramic discharge tube or the sealing<br>
member.<br>
[0043] Molybdenum is suitably used for the invented structure in such<br>
advantages that it has high resistance to a metal vapor, particularly to a metal<br>
halide gas, and that it has high wettability to a ceramic.<br>
[0044] When using molybdenum as a material of a metal member, at least<br>
one of La2O3 and CeO2 may preferably be added to molybdenum in a ratio of 0.1<br>
to 2.0 weight percent as a total.<br>
[0045] A porous bone structure is made of a sintered product of metal<br>
powder. The metal powder may preferably be made of a metal selected from<br><br>
the group consisting of molybdenum, tungsten, rhenium, niobium, tantalum and<br>
the alloys thereof. For further improving the resistance of the structure to a<br>
halogen, a metal selected from the group consisting of molybdenum, tungsten,<br>
rhenium and the alloys thereof is particularly preferable.<br>
[0046] The main components of the metals constituting the metal member<br>
and constituting the porous bone structure may preferably be the same and more<br>
preferably molybdenum. Such (main component) means that the component<br>
constitutes not lower than 60 weight percent of the metal.<br>
[0047] The porous bone structure may preferably has a porosity, of open<br>
pores, of not lower than 15%, and more preferably not lower than 40%, thus<br>
improving the strength of the joining portion. The porosity may preferably be<br>
not higher than 80%, and more preferably be not higher than 70%, thus<br>
effectively impregnating the ceramic into the open pores of the bone structure<br>
and dispersing the stress applied on the structure to improve the resistance<br>
thereof to repeated thermal cycles.<br>
[0048] The second member or sealing member is made of a ceramic or<br>
cermet. The ceramic may preferably be a ceramic alone, selected from the<br>
group consisting of alumina, magnesia, yttria, lanthania and zirconia, or the<br>
mixed compound thereof.<br>
[0049] More particularly, the sealing member may be made of the same or<br>
the different kinds of material as that of the ceramic discharge tube. When the<br>
electric conductor is made of niobium or tantalum, the ceramic discharge tube<br>
and sealing member may preferably be made of the same kind of material,<br>
because in this case the thermal expansion coefficient of the electric conductor is<br>
approaching those of the ceramic discharge lamp and sealing member. Such<br>
(same kind of material) means that their base components of the ceramic<br>
materials are the same and the added component or components may be the same<br>
or different with each other.<br>
[0050] When the metal member is made of molybdenum, tungsten, rhenium<br>
or the alloys thereof, the difference of the thermal expansion coefficients of the<br>
ceramic discharge tube and metal member are relatively increased. Therefore,<br>
it is preferable to adjust the thermal expansion coefficient of the sealing member<br>
between those of the electric conductor and the end portion of the ceramic<br><br>
discharge tube. For that reason, the sealing member may be formed of a cermet.<br>
[0051] A cermet is a composite material of a ceramic and a metal. Such<br>
ceramic may preferably be a ceramic alone, selected from the group consisting of<br>
alumina, magnesia, yttria, lanthania and zirconia, or the mixed compound thereof,<br>
and more preferably be the same kind of ceramic as that of the ceramic discharge<br>
tube, thereby making it possible to co-fire the ceramic discharge tube and sealing<br>
member simultaneously. On this point of view, the ceramic components of the<br>
ceramic discharge tube and the cermet may more preferably be alumina ceramic.<br>
[0052] The metal component of the cermet may preferably be a metal, having<br>
a high temperature melting point and resistance to a metal halide, such as<br>
tungsten, molybdenum, rhenium or the like, or the alloys thereof, thus giving the<br>
sealing member improved resistance to the metal halide. The cermet may<br>
preferably has not lower than 55 weight percent, and more preferably not lower<br>
than 60 weight percent, of a ceramic component (the balance is a metal<br>
component.).<br>
[0053] Preferably, each of a material constituting the intermediate ceramic<br>
composition layer and a ceramic constituting the impregnated ceramic<br>
composition layer has a melting point not more than a temperature subtracted<br>
200°C from a melting point of a ceramic or a cermet constituting the second<br>
member. Thereby, grain boundary crack seldom occurs in the second member.<br>
In this case, the melting point of each materials is not less than 1500°C.<br>
[0054] The above described joining method may be applied to both ends of a<br>
ceramic tube. However, in one end, it is necessary to apply a tubular-shaped<br>
metal member for introducing an ionizable light-emitting substance through the<br>
inner space of the metal member. In the other end, metal members with various<br>
shapes such as a rod, a tube or the like may be applied.<br>
[0055] The shape of a ceramic discharge tube is not particularly limited, and<br>
includes a tube, a cylinder, a barrel or the like. When the metal member is a<br>
tubular shaped member supporting an electrode system, through which an<br>
ionizable light-emitting substance is introduced into the inner space of the<br>
discharge tube, the electrode-system-supporting member is sealed by laser<br>
welding or TIG welding. When using laser welding, for example, Nd/YAG<br>
laser is used. In this case, a clearance between the metal member and an<br><br>
electrode to be inserted into the metal member is between 30 to 150µm at a<br>
diameter direction because, if the clearance is too wide, there is a tendency to<br>
accumulate the light-emitting material in the clearance so that the unevenness of<br>
the property increases, on one hand, and if the clearance is too small, the<br>
electrode system substantially contacts the electrode-system-supporting member<br>
and the thermal stress of the joining portion thereof increases so that there is a<br>
tendency to break the joining portion, on the other hand.<br>
[0056] In the case of a metal halide high pressure discharge lamp, an inert<br>
gas, such as argon, a metal halide and optionally mercury is introduced into the<br>
inner space of the ceramic discharge tube.<br>
[0057] Figures 1, 2, 3, 12, 13 and 14 show the embodiments of the end<br>
portions of the lamp to which the invention is applied.<br>
[0058] A joining portion 6 of the invention is interposed between a sealing<br>
member 4 and a metal member 7 to join them with each other and to secure air-<br>
tightness.<br>
[0059] As shown in figure 12, an axis 27 of an electrode system 18 is<br>
attached to a clogging member 19 (preferably made of a metal), the electrode<br>
system 18 is inserted into the inner space of a ceramic discharge tube and the<br>
clogging member 19 is inserted into the inner space of the metal member 7. As<br>
shown in figure 13, it is possible to expose a metal end 7a to an inner space of<br>
the metal member 7 of the ceramic discharge tube and provide a stopper 48'.<br>
As shown in figure 14, an end portion 19a of the clogging member 19 is joined,<br>
by means of the above welding or the like, to the metal member 7 to form a<br>
sealing portion 21, thereby sealing an ionizable light-emitting substance and a<br>
starter gas in the inner space of the ceramic discharge tube from the outer<br>
atmosphere and providing an electric power to the electrode system 18 through<br>
the clogging member 19. A protrusion 42 functions to position the metal<br>
member 7 and to make flow path of the corrosive gas longer.<br>
[0060] Figure 15 is a diagram schematically showing an embodiment of a<br>
high pressure discharge lamp. A high pressure discharge lamp system 23 has an<br>
outer tube 30 generally made of a hard glass, in which a high pressure discharge<br>
lamp 1 is contained. The outer tube 30 has both ends sealed with ceramic caps<br>
22. Each clogging member 19 is inserted into and joined with each metal<br><br>
member 7. An outer lead wire 25 is connected with each outer end 19a of each<br>
clogging member 19.<br>
[0061] In the embodiment shown in figure 16, the sealing member 4 has no<br>
protrusion on its inner wall surface. And, the metal member 7 and the inner<br>
wall surface of the sealing member 4 is joined substantially along the full length<br>
of the through hole 46 of the sealing member 4. 6A is a joining portion, 13A is<br>
an intermediate glass layer and 14A is main phase.<br>
[0062] In the embodiment shown in figure 17, the inner wall surface lb of<br>
the end portion la of the ceramic discharge tube 1 extends straightforwardly in<br>
the direction of the main axis of the ceramic discharge tube. A hollow 31 is<br>
formed in the end portion 1d of the inner wall surface 1b of the end portion 1a.<br>
An end portion 7a of a metal member 7 is supported in the hollow 31.<br>
A joining portion 6B is interposed between the discharge tube 1 and the metal<br>
member 7 and join them with each other in the hollow 31 to secure the air-<br>
tightness. 32 is a metallized layer.<br>
[0063] Figure 18 is an enlarged view of the region near the hollow 31 shown<br>
in figure 17. The joining portion 6B comprises main phase 14B contacting the<br>
metal member 7 and an intermediate ceramic composition layer 13B contacting<br>
the discharge tube 1. The metallized layer 32 covers the inner wall surface lb<br>
of the end portion 1 a of the discharge tube 1, further covers the surface of the<br>
hollow 31, contacts the edge of the end portion 7a of the metal member 7 and<br>
extends to the edge of the joining portion 6B.<br>
[0064] The embodiment of figure 19 have no protrusion on the inner wall<br>
surface lb of the end portion 1a of the discharge tube 1 and the inner wall<br>
surface lb extends substantially straightforwardly. The inner wall surface 1b<br>
of the end portion 1a and the metal member 7 are joined with each other<br>
substantially along the full length of an opening 40 of the end portion 1 a. 6C is<br>
a joining portion, 13C is an intermediate ceramic composition layer and 14C is<br>
main phase.<br>
[0065] In each embodiment described above, the inventive joining portion is<br>
provided between the outer surface of the metal member and the inner wall<br>
surface of the end portion of the ceramic discharge tube or the sealing member.<br>
In the other words, the above inventive joining portions do not seal the opening<br><br>
in the end portion of the ceramic discharge tube or through hole of the sealing<br>
member. However, the inventive joining portion has high resistance to<br>
corrosion and therefore may seal the opening of the ceramic discharge tube by<br>
itself, by contacting the intermediate ceramic composition layer with the inner<br>
5 wall surface, facing the opening, and by sealing it with the intermediate ceramic<br>
composition layer and the main phase with preserved air-tightness.<br>
Alternatively, the intermediate ceramic composition layer may be contacted with<br>
the inner wall surface, facing the through hole of the sealing member, to seal the<br>
through hole by this intermediate ceramic composition layer and the main phase<br>
10 with preserved air-tightness. In these cases, the metal member is joined to the<br>
main phase without passing through the joining portion. Figures 20 and 21<br>
relate to such embodiments.<br>
[0066] In the embodiment of figure 20, a first sealing member 37 is inserted<br>
within an inner surface 38b near an end face 38c of the ceramic discharge tube<br>
15 38 of a high pressure discharge lamp. An outer surface 38a of the discharge<br>
tube 38 extends straightforwardly in its longitudinal direction. The thickness<br>
of the discharge tube 38 is substantially uniform. A second cylindrical sealing<br>
member 39 is inserted within the interior of the first sealing member 37.<br>
The sealing members 37 and 39 are made of a ceramic or cermet, same as the<br>
20 sealing members described above. The inventive joining portion 6D is formed<br>
within the second sealing member 39.<br>
[0067] When forming the joining portion 6D, a porous bone structure is<br>
inserted within the sealing member 39. Preferably, a metal member 35 and a<br>
metal axis 27, made of molybdenum, is joined to the bone structure in advance.<br>
25 When the outer diameter of the porous bone structure and the inner diameter of<br>
the inner wall surface 39a of the sealing member 39 is strictly adjusted to the<br>
same value, it might be impossible to insert the bone structure due to the<br>
dimension clearance. Preferably, a clearance of 0.05 to 0.10 mm is provided.<br>
When inserting the porous bone structure and melting a ceramic material on the<br>
30 bone structure, the ceramic is impregnated into the porous bone structure to form<br>
main phase 14D and an intermediate ceramic composition layer 13D is formed in<br>
the clearance of the bone structure and sealing member 39.<br>
[0068] Consequently, the through hole 46 of the sealing member 39 is<br><br>
substantially sealed by the main phase 14D and the intermediate ceramic<br>
composition layer 13D is formed within the clearance between the main phase<br>
14D and the inner wall surface 39a of the sealing member 39. The axis 27 is<br>
joined onto the surface, facing the inner space 17, of the main phase 14D and a<br>
metal member 35 is joined to the outer surface of the main phase 14D.<br>
A ceramic composition layer 45 is further formed within the clearance between<br>
the metal member 35 and sealing member 39.<br>
[0069] In the embodiment shown in figure 21, as shown in figure 20, the<br>
inventive joining portion 6E is formed within an opening 40 of the end portion<br>
1a of the discharge tube 1.<br>
[0070] When forming the joining portion 6E, a porous bone structure is<br>
inserted into the inner opening 40 of the end portion 1a of the discharge tube 1.<br>
A metal member 35 and a metal axis 27 are joined to the bone structure in<br>
advance. A clearance, preferably of 0.05 to 0.10 mm, is provided between the<br>
outer surface of the bone structure and the inner surface 1b of the discharge tube<br>
1. When inserting the porous bone structure and melting the ceramic material<br>
on the bone structure, the melted ceramic is impregnated into the porous bone<br>
structure to form main phase 14E and an intermediate glass layer 13E is formed<br>
in the clearance between the main phase 14E and the discharge tube 1.<br>
[0071] The relation among the clearance between the outer surface of the<br>
bone structure and the inner surface of the discharge tube, the insertion of the<br>
electrode system (easiness to insert), and the fullness of ceramic composition<br>
into the bone structure shows as follows.<br>
Table 3<br><br><br>
[0072] If the clearance is 0.03 mm, the outer surface of the bone structure<br>
makes contacts with the inner surface of the discharge tube and thus the bone<br>
structure may be damaged when the electrode system inclines to the insertion<br>
direction of thereof. On the other hand, if the clearance is 0.12 mm, the<br>
ceramics composition is not filled into the bone structure and thus the ceramics<br>
composition may flow downward.<br>
[0073] Next, the most preferred process for producing high pressure<br>
discharge lamps according to embodiments of the invention will be described.<br>
When using a sealing member, powdery raw material (preferably alumina<br>
powder) of the sealing member is shaped into a shaped body, with a shape of a<br>
ring, of the sealing member. At this stage, it is preferred to press-mold granules,<br>
granulated with a spray drier or the like, under a pressure of 2000 to<br>
3000 kgf/cm2. The resulting shaped body may preferably be subjected to<br>
dewaxing and calcination to obtain a calcined body, which is then finish-sintered<br>
at a temperature between 1600 to 1900°C under reducing atmosphere of a dew<br>
point of-15 to 15°C.<br>
[0074] The dewaxing process may preferably be carried out at a temperature<br>
of 600 to 800°C and the calcination process may preferably be carried out at a<br>
temperature of 1200 to 1400°C under reducing atmosphere of hydrogen.<br>
The calcination may provide a some degree of strength to the shaped body of<br>
the sealing member and facilitate the handling of the sealing member.<br>
A hollow may be formed, for example by machining.<br>
[0075] Also, metal powder is formulated, crashed, dried, and milled with an<br>
added binder, such as ethyl cellulose, acrylic resin or the like, to obtain paste,<br>
which is then applied onto the outer surface of the end portion of the metal<br>
member and dried at a temperature of 20 to 60°C. The resulting calcined body<br>
is sintered under reducing or inert atmosphere or vacuum of a dew point of 20 to<br>
50°C at a temperature of 1200 to 1700°C.<br>
[0076] Also, a main body of a ceramic discharge tube is shaped, dewaxed<br>
and calcined to obtain a calcined body of the ceramic discharge tube. A pre-<br>
sintered body of the sealing member is inserted into the end portion of the<br>
resulting calcined body, set at a predetermined position and finish-sintered under<br>
reducing atmosphere of a dew point of -15 to 15°C at a temperature of 1600 to<br><br>
1900°C to obtain a ceramic discharge tube.<br>
[0077] Also, powder or frit is pre-formulated to a predetermined ceramic<br>
composition, crashed, granulated with an added binder such as polyvinylalcohol<br>
or the like, press-molded and dewaxed to obtain molding material.<br>
Alternatively, powder or frit for a ceramic is melted and solidified to obtain solid,<br>
which is then crashed, granulated with added binder, press-molded and dewaxed.<br>
In this case, it is preferred to add 3 to 5 weight percent of a binder to the powder,<br>
to press-mold at a pressure of 1 to 5 ton, to dewax at about 700°C and to calcine<br>
at a temperature of 1000 to 1200°C.<br>
[0078] Such discharge tube, sealing member, metal member, porous bone<br>
structure and molding material are assembled as shown in figure 1 and heated to<br>
a temperature of 1000 to 1600°c under non-oxidizing atmosphere.<br>
[0079] The ceramic discharge lamp as described referring to figures 1 to 7<br>
was produced according to the above process. The ceramic discharge tube and<br>
sealing member was made of alumina ceramic, and a pipe made of molybdenum<br>
is used as the metal member. Molybdenum powder with an average particle<br>
diameter of 3 µm was used as the porous bone structure, and ethyl cellulose is<br>
used as a binder. The molybdenum powder had a tap density of 2.9 g/cc.<br>
The composition of the impregnated ceramic phase and the intermediate ceramic<br>
layer were dysprosium oxide 20 weight percent, lanthanum oxide 17 weight<br>
percent, alumina 35 weight percent, yttrium oxide 20 weight percent and silica 8<br>
weight percent. In the resulting joined layer, crystallinity of the ceramic<br>
constituting thereof was 80 percent.<br>
[0080] The ceramic discharge tube was subjected to a thermal cycle test.<br>
Particularly, in one cycle, its temperature is maintained at a room temperature for<br>
15 minutes, increased to 1050°C, maintained at 1050°C for 5 minutes and<br>
decreased to a room temperature. 1000 thermal cycles were performed. After<br>
that, helium leak test was performed to investigate the leakage of helium.<br>
The leak rate was lower than 10-10 atm • cc • sec.<br>
[0081] 850°C is a temperature normally utilized and 1050°C is an overloaded<br>
temperature. The resistance to the latter means that the discharge tube may<br>
safely preserve a starter gas and an ionizable light-emitting substance therein for<br>
a longer period of time, even when the gas and substance is introduced into the<br><br>
discharge tube under a pressure higher than a normal value.<br>
[0082] Besides, figures 4 and 5 are photographs, taken by a scanning type<br>
electron microscope, showing the region near the interface between the inner<br>
surface of a metal member 7 and a sealing member 4 of this embodiment.<br>
[0083] Also another high pressure discharge lamp was produced according to<br>
the above process. However, the composition of the ceramic was dysprosium<br>
oxide 47 weight percent, alumina 48 weight percent, yttrium oxide 1 weight<br>
percent and silica 4 weight percent. In the resulting joined layer, crystallinity<br>
of the ceramic constituting impregnated ceramic phase and the intermediate<br>
ceramic layer was 90 percent.<br>
[0084] The ceramic discharge tube was subjected to a thermal cycle test.<br>
Particularly, in one cycle, its temperature is maintained at a room temperature for<br>
15 minutes, increased to 1050°C, maintained at 1050°C for 5 minutes and<br>
decreased to a room temperature. 1000 thermal cycles were performed. After<br>
that, helium leak test was performed to investigate the leakage of helium.<br>
The leak rate was lower than 10-10 atm • cc • sec.<br>
[0085] When a sealing member is not applied in a high pressure discharge<br>
lamp, a main body of a ceramic discharge tube is shaped to obtain a shaped body,<br>
which is then dewaxed, calcined and finish-sintered. Also, paste of metal<br>
powder is produced as described above, applied or printed onto the surface of a<br>
metal member and subjected to heat treatment to form a porous bone structure.<br>
After the discharge tube and metal member are assembled and the above<br>
described material is set, they are heat-treated as described above to obtain a<br>
high pressure discharge lamp.<br>
[0086] The inventive joined body and joining method may be widely applied<br>
to, other than a high pressure discharge lamp, all the structural bodies, such as a<br>
switching device of vacuum, having a conductive portion or terminal whose air-<br>
tightness at a high temperature of about 900°C is indispensable.<br>
[0087] The present invention has been explained referring to the preferred<br>
embodiments, however , the present invention is not limited to the illustrated<br>
embodiments which are given by way of examples only , and may be carried out<br>
in various modes without departing from the scope of the invention .<br>
[0088] Recently, it is the worldwide requirement to use high pressure Xe gas<br><br>
instead of mercury in the high pressure discharge lamp. According to the<br>
strength at the elevated temperature achieved by the high pressure discharge<br>
lamp of the present invention, it is possible to endure the rising of the internal<br>
pressure occurred at the ignition of the high pressure discharge lamp which does<br>
not contain the mercury. As a result, the high pressure discharge lamp<br>
according to the present invention can be applied to not only a lamp for general<br>
lighting but also a head lamp for vehicle.<br><br>
