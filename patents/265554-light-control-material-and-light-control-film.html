				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
LIGHT CONTROL MATERIAL AND LIGHT CONTROL FILM<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a light control<br>
material capable of optionally controlling the light<br>
transmittance in an arbitrary wavelength range among a wide<br>
wavelength range, and also relates to a light control film<br>
formed by using the light control material.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
[0002]<br>
A light control material capable of controlling the<br>
light transmittance in a specific wavelength range has been<br>
utilized for controlling transmitted light or for<br>
controlling color by interrupting light of a specific<br>
wavelength, and applied in various fields including, for<br>
example, interior materials, construction materials,<br>
electronic parts, and the like. Furthermore, in these days,<br>
materials capable of controlling the light transmittance in<br>
the infrared range have attracted attention and a variety<br>
of investigations on such materials have been conducted.<br>
[0003]<br>
As examples of the light control materials of this<br>
kind, Patent Document 1 and Patent Document 2 propose a<br>
light control material containing a suspension of light-<br>
polarizing particles and a polymer resin. In a light<br>
control body formed by using the light control material,<br>
the polarizing particles are disposed to form a translucent<br>
form in response to an electric field. However, this kind<br>
of light control material has a problem that it is not<br>
possible to optionally and easily control the light<br>
transmittance in an arbitrary wavelength range among a<br><br>
sufficiently wide wavelength range from the visible light<br>
range to the near-infrared range.<br>
[0004]<br>
Patent Document 3 and Patent Document 4 disclose a<br>
heat ray shielding light control material which is<br>
characterized by that a polymer gel that changes its volume<br>
depending on temperatures is used, and that a colorant and<br>
an infrared absorbing material are included in the polymer<br>
gel. A light control body formed by using this kind of<br>
light control material can control the transmittance of<br>
heat rays (near-infrared rays) in response to temperature<br>
due to the behavior of the infrared absorbing material, and<br>
also the transmittance in the visible light range can be<br>
controlled by the colorant. However, this kind of light<br>
shielding material has a problem that it is not possible to<br>
optionally and easily control the light transmittance in an<br>
arbitrary wavelength range in a sufficiently wide<br>
wavelength range from the visible light range to the near-<br>
infrared range.<br>
[0005]<br>
Patent Document 5 discloses an electrochromic thin<br>
film consisting of a niobium oxide, and describes that the<br>
electrochromic thin film shows an excellent light<br>
controlling property in a wide wavelength range. However,<br>
when an inorganic oxide of this kind is used as a light<br>
control material, complicated steps need to be carried out<br>
to produce a light control element, thus leaving a problem<br>
for practical application.<br>
[0006]<br>
With respect to the light control material for<br>
controlling the light transmittance in the infrared range,<br>
for example, Patent Document 6 discloses a material<br>
containing a diimonium salt compound having an infrared<br>
absorption and a polyester; Patent Document 7 discloses a<br>
coating liquid containing a dioxadinaphthopentacene<br><br>
compound having an infrared absorption and a binder resin;<br>
and Patent Document 8 discloses a heat shielding coating<br>
material using an infrared-absorbing perylene based pigment.<br>
However, those light control materials have a problem in<br>
dispersibility of the infrared absorbing compound in a<br>
binder resin, and due to uneven dispersion, uniform<br>
absorption characteristics may not be easily achieved.<br>

DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
PROBLEMS TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION<br>
[0007]<br>
In light of the above-mentioned current situation, a<br>
purpose of the present invention is to provide a light<br>
control material capable of optionally controlling the<br>
light transmittance in an arbitrary wavelength range among<br>
a wide wavelength range, and a light control film formed by<br>
using the light control material.<br>
MEANS FOR SOLVING THE PROBLEMS<br><br>
[0008]<br>
The present invention is a light control material,<br>
which contains a stimulus sensitive resin and is capable of<br>
controlling the light transmittance in a specific<br>
wavelength range, the stimulus sensitive resin being a<br>
polyacetylene compound having a repeating unit represented<br>
by the following general formula (1) or general formula (2).<br>
[0009]<br>
[Chemical Formula 1]<br><br>
[0010]<br>
In the formula (1), R1 represents a naphthalene group,<br>
a phenanthrene group, a pyrenyl group or an antheracene<br>
group, each of the four groups being substituted by a group<br>
selected from the group consisting of: an alkyl group<br>
having 1 to 4 0 carbon atoms, an alkoxy group (with an alkyl<br>
group having 1 to 4 0 carbon atoms), an SR4 group (R4<br>
represents a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group having 1 to 4 0<br>
carbon atoms) , an NR5R6 group (R5 and R6 may be the same or<br>
different, and each represents a hydrogen atom or a group<br>
selected from alkyl groups having 1 to 40 carbon atoms), a<br>
cyano group, a carboxy group, a sulfoxyl group, an ester<br>
group, an amide group and COR7 (R7 represents an alkyl<br>
group having 1 to 4 0 carbon atoms).<br>
[0011]<br>
[Chemical Formula 2]<br><br>
[0012]<br>
In the formula (2), R2 represents a naphthalene group<br>
or an anthracene group; R3 represents a phenyl group<br>
substituted by a substituent X at the position m or the<br>
position p; and the substituent X represents a group<br>
selected from the group consisting of: an alkyl group<br><br>
having 1 to 2 0 carbon atoms, an alkoxy group (with an alkyl<br>
group having 1 to 20 carbon atoms) , an SR4 group (R4<br>
represents a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group having 1 to 20<br>
carbon atoms), an NR5R6 group (R5 and R6 may be the same or<br>
different, and each represents a hydrogen atom or a group<br>
selected from alkyl groups having 1 to 20 carbon atoms), a<br>
cyano group, a carboxy group, a sulfoxyl group, an ester<br>
group, an amide group and COR7 (R7 represents an alkyl<br>
group having 1 to 20 carbon atoms).<br>
The following description will discuss the present<br>
invention in more detail.<br>
[0013]<br>
As a result of intensive investigations, the present<br>
inventors have found that a polyacetylene compound having a<br>
specific structure can control the light transmittance of a<br>
significantly wide wavelength range by chemical or electric<br>
stimulus or physical stimulus such as a change of a<br>
pressure or a temperature, thereby completing the present<br>
invention.<br>
[0014]<br>
The light control material of the present invention<br>
contains a stimulus sensitive resin, which is a<br>
polyacetylene compound having a repeating unit represented<br>
by the above-mentioned general formula (1) or general<br>
formula (2) . When the light control material containing<br>
the above-mentioned polyacetylene compound has one or more<br>
polycyclic aromatic side chains, the light control material<br>
can change the light transmittance in a wide wavelength<br>
range in response to chemical stimulus or electric stimulus,<br>
or physical stimulus such as a change of a pressure or a<br>
temperature.<br>
[0015]<br>
Out of the polyacetylene compounds having the<br>
repeating unit represented by the general formula (1), a<br>
polyacetylene compound in which R1 is a substituted<br><br>
naphthalene group is preferable. Having the naphthalene<br>
group as R1 makes it possible to exert an excellent light<br>
absorption property in a sufficiently long wavelength range<br>
when stimulus is applied, and also makes it possible to<br>
preferably control the light transmittance of the near-<br>
infrared range.<br>
A particularly preferable example of the substituent<br>
substituting R1 includes a group with a straight chain<br>
alkyl group having 6 to 20 carbon atoms. By substitution<br>
with this type of substituent, the polyacetylene compound<br>
shows, when the below-mentioned stimulus is applied, a high<br>
absorption in the near-infrared range, and is preferably<br>
applicable for use of shielding near-infrared rays.<br>
Moreover, it is possible to optionally control the amount<br>
of absorption and the wavelength in the near-infrared range<br>
by selecting the substituent. Furthermore, since the<br>
repetition endurance of the light control material of the<br>
present invention is particularly improved, the light<br>
control material is very useful as a light control material<br>
for controlling light by applying an external stimulus with<br>
repetitive frequency such as electric stimulus.<br>
Furthermore, the color contrast due to presence or<br>
absence of stimulus can be enhanced.<br>
[0016]<br>
On the other hand, in the case where a branched alkyl<br>
group is used as a substituent for substituting R1 or as a<br>
substituent for substituting R3, the solubility of the<br>
polyacetylene compound having the repeating unit<br>
represented by the general formula (1) or (2) to a solvent<br>
can be improved. Therefore, the light control material of<br>
the present invention is preferably a copolymer containing<br>
the repeating units represented by the general formula (1)<br>
or (2), each having a different substituent for<br>
substituting R1 or R3 with one another, at an appropriate<br>
blending ratio by taking into consideration the desired<br><br>
light absorption property and solubility to the solvent.<br>
[0017]<br>
Preferable examples of the polyacetylene compound<br>
containing the repeating unit represented by the general<br>
formula (1) or (2) include polyacetylene compounds<br>
containing a repeating unit represented by the following<br>
formula (1-1), (1-2), (1-3), (1-4), (1-5) or (2-1),<br>
although not particularly limited thereto. This is because<br>
those polyacetylene compounds are especially soluble in a<br>
solvent, and have a high absorption in the near-infrared<br>
range. Moreover, out of the compounds mentioned below,<br>
specifically, a repeating unit represented by the below-<br>
mentioned formulae (1-3), (1-4) and (1-5) contain a<br>
naphthalene group which is substituted by a straight chain<br>
alkyl group having 6 to 18 carbon atoms, and the<br>
polyacetylene compounds are very useful as a light control<br>
material to control light by applying an external stimulus<br>
with repetitive frequency such as electric stimulus.<br>
[0018]<br>
[Chemical Formula 3]<br><br><br><br>
[0024]<br>
When a substituent containing a chiral center carbon<br>
atom is used as the substituent for substituting R1 or the<br>
substituent for substituting R3, the on/off switching based<br>
on circular dichroism can be achieved in a reversible<br>
manner by chemical stimulus or electric stimulus, or<br>
physical stimulus such as pressure and temperature, and<br>
thus use as a polarized filter can also become possible.<br>
Examples of the substituent having a chiral center carbon<br>
atom include the repeating unit represented by the<br>
following formula (1-6) or (1-7), and the like.<br>
[0025]<br>
[Chemical Formula 9]<br><br><br>
[0026]<br>
[Chemical Formula 10]<br><br>
[0027]<br>
In the polyacetylene compound having the repeating<br>
unit represented by the general formula (1) or the general<br>
formula (2), the number of repetition of the repeating unit<br>
is not particular limited; however, the preferable lower<br>
limit is 5 and the preferable upper limit is 100,000. In<br>
the case of less than 5, a sufficient color controlling<br>
function may not be exerted, whereas in the case of more<br>
than 100,000, the solubility may be lowered. The more<br>
preferable lower limit is 10, and the more preferable upper<br>
limit is 1000.<br>
[0028]<br>
The above-mentioned stimulus sensitive resin may have<br>
a repeating unit that is other than the repeating unit<br>
represented by the formula (1) or the formula (2).<br>
The repeating unit other than the repeating unit<br>
represented by the formula (1) or the formula (2) is not<br>
particularly limited, and examples thereof include<br>
phenylacetylene, diphenylacethylene, styrene, and the like.<br>
In the case where the stimulus sensitive resin has<br>
the repeating unit other than the repeating unit<br>
represented by the formula (1) or the formula (2) as<br>
mentioned above, the preferable lower limit of the content<br>
of the repeating unit represented by the formula (1) or the<br>
formula (2) is 90 mol%. In the case of less than 90 mol%,<br>
a sufficient light control function may not be exerted.<br>
The more preferable lower limit is 98 mol%.<br>
[0029]<br>
As a method of producing the polyacetylene compound<br><br>
having the repeating unit represented by the general<br>
formula (1) or the general formula (2), for example, a<br>
method including mixing a monomer material, a catalyst and<br>
a solvent under dry nitrogen atmosphere, allowing the<br>
mixture to polymerize for a predetermined time at a room<br>
temperature or a predetermined temperature, and stopping<br>
the polymerization reaction by adding a large amount of<br>
methanol to deposit polymers, and the like can be<br>
exemplified, although not particularly limited thereto.<br>
In the case where the above-mentioned stimulus<br>
sensitive resin has a repeating unit that is other than the<br>
repeating unit represented by the formula (1) or the<br>
formula (2), a monomer such as phenylacetylene,<br>
diphenylacethylene and styrene may be concomitantly used as<br>
the monomer material.<br>
[0030]<br>
Preferable examples of the above-mentioned catalyst<br>
include WCl6, WBr6, WI6, WF6, W(CO)6, MoCl5, CrCl3, TaCl5,<br>
NbCl5, MnCl3, RuCl3, RhCl3 and the like, although not<br>
particularly limited thereto.<br>
[0031]<br>
Examples of the above-mentioned solvent include<br>
toluene, chloroform, carbon tetrachloride and the like,<br>
although not particularly limited thereto. It is<br>
preferable to use the solvent that has been dehydrated by a<br>
conventionally known method so as not to inhibit the<br>
polymerization reaction.<br>
[0032]<br>
The above-mentioned polymerization method is not<br>
particularly limited, and for example a method including<br>
introducing a predetermined amount of each compound into a<br>
reactor vessel in which a stirrer is disposed, etc., and<br>
mixing those compounds at a constant temperature, and the<br>
like can be exemplified.<br>
The polymerization temperature may be at a room<br><br>
temperature or may be heated to about 8 0°C.<br>
[0033]<br>
The light control material of the present invention<br>
may include a stimulus sensitive resin that is other than<br>
the polyacetylene compound mentioned above, as a stimulus<br>
sensitive resin. Examples of such stimulus sensitive<br>
resins include a polyaniline compound, a polythiophene<br>
compound, a polypyrrole compound, and the like, although<br>
not particularly limited thereto.<br>
[0034]<br>
The light control material of the present invention<br>
may contain other resins in order to improve moldability or<br>
mechanical strength of the molded products.<br>
The above-mentioned other resins are not particularly<br>
limited as long as they have a high transparency and a good<br>
mixing characteristics with the above-mentioned stimulus<br>
sensitive resin, and examples thereof include polyolefins,<br>
polyacrylates, polymethacrylates, polyesters, polyamides,<br>
polycarbonates, and the like.<br>
[0035]<br>
The light control material of the present invention<br>
may contain an oxidizing agent and/or a reducing agent, in<br>
addition to the stimulus sensitive resin. By containing an<br>
oxidizing agent and/or a reducing agent, the oxidizing<br>
agent and/or the reducing agent act as a chemical stimulus<br>
to the stimulus sensitive resin, with the effect that the<br>
transparency at an arbitrary wavelength can be controlled.<br>
[0036]<br>
Examples of the oxidizing agent include nitric acid,<br>
hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, iodine, chlorine, iron<br>
(III) chloride, iron (III) bromide, copper (II) chloride,<br>
tin (IV) chloride, gold (III) chloride, lithium perchlorate,<br>
copper perchlorate, and the like, although not particularly<br>
limited thereto.<br>
Examples of the reducing agent include sodium<br><br>
thiosulfate, sodium nitrite, sulfurous acid, hydrogen<br>
sulfide, dithionous acid, sodium dithionite, hydrazine,<br>
phenyl hydrazine, hydrazine hydrochloride, and the like,<br>
although not particularly limited thereto.<br>
[0037]<br>
In the case where any of the polyacetylene compounds<br>
of the above-mentioned formula (1-1), (1-2), (1-3), (1-4)<br>
or (1-5) is contained as the stimulus sensitive resin, it<br>
is preferable to use a halide of a transition metal such as<br>
iron (III) chloride, iron (III) bromide, copper (II)<br>
chloride and gold (III) chloride, among the above-mentioned<br>
oxidizing agents. By using those oxidizing agents, it is<br>
possible to obtain a light control material showing a large<br>
change in the transmittance. The more preferable oxidizing<br>
agents are gold (III) chloride and iron (III) chloride.<br>
[0038]<br>
In the case where the polyacetylene compound of the<br>
formula (2-1) is contained as the stimulus sensitive resin,<br>
it is preferable to use a halide of a transition metal such<br>
as iron (III) chloride, iron (III) bromide, copper (II)<br>
chloride and gold (III) chloride, or nitric acid, among the<br>
above-mentioned oxidizing agents. By using those oxidizing<br>
agents, it is possible to obtain a light control material<br>
showing a large change in the transmittance. The more<br>
preferable oxidizing agent is gold (III) chloride.<br>
[0039]<br>
The method of adding the oxidizing agent and/or the<br>
reducing agent to the light control material of the present<br>
invention is not particularly limited and, for example, a<br>
method including adding the oxidizing agent and/or the<br>
reducing agent directly, or adding a solution of the<br>
oxidizing agent and/or the reducing agent, in a solution<br>
prepared by dissolving the polyacetylene compound in an<br>
appropriate solvent such as toluene, chloroform and carbon<br>
tetrachloride so as to bring the stimulus sensitive resin<br><br>
into contact with the oxidizing agent and/or the reducing<br>
agent in a liquid phase, may be preferably used.<br>
In the case where addition of the oxidizing agent<br>
and/or the reducing agent is carried out in the above-<br>
mentioned manner, by changing the kinds of the stimulus<br>
sensitive resin, the kinds of the oxidizing agent and/or<br>
the reducing agent, and the concentration thereof in the<br>
solution, it is possible to arbitrarily control the<br>
wavelength range where the light transmittance changes as<br>
well as the light transmittance. Moreover, in the case<br>
where the light control film is produced according to the<br>
method mentioned below, by using the light control material<br>
whose light transmittance has been arbitrarily controlled<br>
as mentioned above, it is possible to produce a light<br>
control film having a desired light controlling property.<br>
[0040]<br>
In the method of adjusting the light transmittance of<br>
an arbitrary wavelength by adding the oxidizing agent<br>
and/or the reducing agent, the relationship between the<br>
addition amount of the oxidizing agent and/or the reducing<br>
agent and the light transmittance is specifically described<br>
as follows: that is, for example, in the case where the<br>
stimulus sensitive resin is any of the polyacetylene<br>
compounds having a repeating unit represented by the<br>
formula (1-1), (1-2), (1-3), (1-4), (1-5) or (2-1), by<br>
adding iron (III) chloride to a chloroform solution of the<br>
stimulus sensitive resin in such a manner that the blending<br>
quantity of the oxidizing agent relative to polyacetylene<br>
in the light control material is 5 to 300% by weight, the<br>
light transmittance of the visible light range is changed<br>
so that color changes can be generated by the light control.<br>
On the other hand, by adding iron (III) chloride to a<br>
chloroform solution of the stimulus sensitive resin in such<br>
a manner that the final concentration of the iron (III)<br>
chloride is 20 to 100% by weight, the light transmittance<br><br>
of the near-infrared range can be changed (lowered).<br>
[0041]<br>

examples thereof include a method of uniformly mixing the<br>
stimulus sensitive resin with the optionally added<br>
oxidizing agent, reducing agent and various additives, each<br>
at a predetermined blending amount, in the solvent, and the<br>
like.<br>
[0043]<br>
An application use of the light control material of<br>
the present invention is not particularly limited, and for<br>
example, by increasing the light absorption in the visible<br>
light range, it is possible to be used as a coating agent<br>
for optical components such as various kinds of filters, or<br>
as a coating agent for various kinds of display elements,<br>
or the like. Moreover, use as a display material is also<br>
possible. On the other hand, by increasing the light<br>
absorption in the near-infrared range or the infrared range,<br>
it is possible to be used as a barrier coating or as a<br>
coating agent for near-infrared ray shielding for various<br>
kinds of display panels. Furthermore, the light control<br>
material of the present invention may be formed into a film<br>
to be used as a light control film. The light control film,<br>
which comprises the light control material of the present<br>
invention is also included in the present invention.<br>
[0044]<br>
An embodiment of the light control film of the<br>
present invention is not particularly limited, and may be,<br><br>
for example, a film-formed body produced by forming the<br>
above-mentioned light control material into a film, or<br>
those produced by forming a film-formed body by using the<br>
light control material on a substrate. Moreover, an<br>
embodiment in which the film-formed body formed by using<br>
the light control material is interposed between two sheets<br>
of the substrate may be possible. Furthermore, an<br>
embodiment of the light control film, in which the light<br>

formed with the above-mentioned light control material and<br>
another film.<br>
The above-mentioned another film is not particularly<br>
limited, and an example thereof includes a film that shows<br>

present invention is not particularly limited; however, the<br>
preferable lower limit is 100 A, and the preferable upper<br>
limit is 10 µm. In the case of less than 100 A, sufficient<br>
light control functions may not be exerted, whereas in the<br>
case of more than 10 µm, the visible light transmittance is<br>
reduced and thus the transparency may be lost.<br>

and a casting method can be used.<br>
[0049]<br>
Since the light control film of the present invention<br>
is formed with a light control material containing a<br>
stimulus sensitive resin, the light control film can change<br>
the light transmittance in a wide wavelength range in<br>
response to chemical stimulus or electric stimulus, or<br>

of the present invention into contact with steam containing<br>
the oxidizing agent and/or the reducing agent; and the like.<br>

transparent electrode film is formed on a conventionally<br>
known transparent substrate, and the like may be used.<br>

thereto.<br>
[0052]<br>
Examples of the above-mentioned glass include soda-<br>
lime glass, lead glass, borosilicate glass, silica glass<br>
and the like, although not particularly limited thereto.<br>
On the other hand, examples of the above-mentioned resin<br>

and a polymer blend of polyacryls, vinyl-based resins,<br>
polyolefins, polyesters, polyamides, polycarbonates, epoxy-<br>
based resins, acetal-based resins and the like, or the like,<br>
although not particularly limited thereto. Moreover, a<br>
flexible substrate such as polyesters, polyimides,<br>

[0054]<br>
An electrolyte forming the electrolyte layer is not<br>
particularly limited, and examples thereof include: a thin<br>
layer of inorganic dielectric such as tantalum oxide,<br><br>
niobium oxide and titanium oxide; a polymer electrolyte<br>
formed with a combination of an electrolyte including an<br>

[0055]<br>
The method of providing a temperature stimulus to the<br>
light control film of the present invention is not<br>
particularly limited, and for example, a method including<br>
heating the light control film of the present invention to<br>
a temperature of 80 to 300°C, or more desirably 150 to<br>

temperature condition changes the molecular structure<br>
forming the light control film, causing the improvement in<br>
the regularity of the primary structure or the high-order<br>
structure. As a result of this, absorption wavelength of<br>
the light control film in the visible light range can be<br>
shifted to the long wavelength side, and the light<br>
transmittance can be easily changed. Since control of the<br>
light transmittance of the light control film by the<br>
temperature stimulus is attributed to the change in the<br><br>
molecular structure, it is possible to control the light<br>
transmittance of the light control film of the present<br>
invention in an irreversible manner by selecting a<br>
temperature and the like.<br>
[0056]<br>
The light control film and the light control body of<br>

transmittance of light in an arbitrary wavelength among a<br>
wide wavelength range. An application of the light control<br>
film and the light control body is not particularly limited,<br>
and by adjusting the absorption of light in the visible<br>
light range, the light control film and the light control<br>
body can be used as optical components such as various<br>
kinds of color filters, a window material for vehicles, a<br>
window material for buildings, or a material for eye<br>
glasses. Furthermore, by reducing the transmittance in the<br>
near-infrared range or in the infrared range, the light<br>
control film and the light control body can be used as a<br>
near-infrared absorption filter for various kinds of panels,<br>
or as various kinds of screens, a window material for<br>
vehicles, a window material for buildings, and the like.<br>

transmittance in an arbitrary wavelength range among light<br>
transmittance in a wide wavelength range, and a light<br>
control film formed by using the light control material.<br>
Moreover, by selecting a condition for providing a stimulus,<br>
the light control film can be used as a light control film<br>
having an excellent visibility and an excellent heat<br>
shielding property.<br>
BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br><br>
[0058]<br>
Hereinafter, embodiments of the present invention<br>
will be described in more detail with reference to<br>
examples; however, the present invention is not limited to<br>
the examples.<br>
[0059]<br>
(Example 1)<br>
(1) Preparation of poly(1-ethynyl-2-methylnaphthalene)<br>
To 20 mL of triethylamine were added 10 g of 1-bromo-<br>
2-methylnaphthalene, 0.63 g of<br>
dichlorobis(triphenylphosphine)palladium, 0.24 g of<br>
triphenylphosphine, 0.24 g of copper bromide, 0.95 g of<br>
lithium bromide, and 7.6 g of 3-methyl-l-butyn-3-ol, and<br>
reacted at 90 °C for 8 hours.<br>
After removing the solvent by an evaporator, ethyl<br>
ether was added to the resulting solution to extract the<br>
generated compound. The ethyl ether layer was washed with<br>
300 mL of distilled water for three times, dried over<br>
anhydrous magnesium sulfate for 24 hours, followed by<br>
filtration and removal of the solvent in the filtrate<br>
solution by evaporation, and then the resulting product was<br>
purified on a column using acetic acid/hexane (1/4) as a<br>
developing solvent.<br>
[0060]<br>
Next, 30 mL of diethylene glycol and 4.4 g of<br>
potassium hydroxide were added to the compound obtained,<br>
and stirred at 90°C for 15 hours. Ethyl ether was added to<br>
the resulting solution to extract the generated compound.<br>
The ethyl ether layer was washed twice with 300 mL of<br>
distilled water and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate<br>
for 24 hours, followed by filtration and the removal of the<br>
solvent. The resulting product was purified on a column<br>
using hexane as a developing solvent, thereby 3.5 g of 1-<br>
ethynyl-2-methylnaphthalene was obtained. The obtained 1-<br>
ethynyl-2-methylnaphthalene was analyzed by 1H-NMR(27 0MHz,<br><br>
CDCl3) , and the NMR spectra showed peak at δ 8.3(1H),<br>
7.8(2H), 7.5(3H), 3.7(1H), 2.6(3H).<br>
Next, 0.39 g of the obtained 1-ethynyl-2-<br>
methylnaphthalene was polymerized with a WCl6 catalyst so<br>
that 0.21 g of poly(1-ethynyl-2-methylnaphthalene) was<br>
obtained.<br>
[0061]<br>
(2) Production of light control material and light control<br>
film<br>
The obtained poly (1-ethynyl-2-methylnaphthalene) was<br>
dissolved in chloroform so as to prepare a chloroform<br>
solution containing 0.8% by weight of the poly(1-ethynyl-2-<br>
methylnaphthalene). Further, iron (III) chloride was added<br>
to the chloroform solution in the respective amounts of 16%<br>
by weight, 30% by weight and 50% by weight relative to the<br>
poly(1-ethynyl-2-methylnaphthalene), and then stirred,<br>
thereby three kinds of light control materials were<br>
obtained. Further, gold (III) chloride was added to the<br>
chloroform solution in an amount of 30% by weight relative<br>
to the poly(1-ethynyl-2-methylnaphthalene), and then<br>
stirred, thereby a light control material was obtained. The<br>
light control materials obtained above were each applied<br>
for coating on a glass substrate having a thickness of 0.1<br>
mm by a spin coating method (800 rpm x 10 minutes), and<br>
dried for 1 hour to form coating films, thereby light<br>
control films were obtained.<br>
[0062]<br>
The light transmitting properties of the obtained<br>
light control films are as shown in Figs 1 and 2.<br>
According to Figs. 1 and 2, it is found that each of<br>
the obtained light control films has an absorption in a<br>
wide wavelength range, and that the light transmittance is<br>
optionally controllable by the types and amounts of the<br>
oxidizing agent. Moreover, it is found that the light<br>
control films have a high absorption band in the infrared<br><br>
range, and that the absorption wavelength changes depending<br>
on the types and addition amounts of the oxidizing agent.<br>
[0063]<br>
(Example 2)<br>
(1)	Preparation of poly(1-ethynyl-2-n-hexylnaphthalene)<br>
acetylene<br>
A 1.6 mol/L hexane solution of n-butyl lithium was<br>
added to 30 mL of a tetrahydrofuran solution of 3.0 g of<br>
ethynylnaphthalene at -50°C under a nitrogen atmosphere,<br>
and the mixture was cooled to -90°C, and then 15 mL of a<br>
tetrahydrofuran solution of 2.5 g of potassium tert-<br>
butoxide was added thereto. After stirring at -80°C for 1<br>
hour, the temperature was raised up to 5°C. At -70°C, 3.3 g<br>
of bromohexane was dropped to the resulting solution, and<br>
stirred overnight at 30°C. 100 mL of water was dropped to<br>
the resulting solution at 0°C, and hexane was added thereto<br>
to extract the generated compound. The hexane layer was<br>
washed with 300 mL of distilled water for 3 times, dried<br>
over anhydrous magnesium sulfate for 24 hours, followed by<br>
filtration, and the solvent was removed by evaporation.<br>
And purification on the column was performed by using<br>
hexane as a developing solvent so that 2.2 g of l-ethynyl-<br>
2-n-hexylnaphthalene was obtained. The obtained l-ethynyl-<br>
2-n-hexylnaphthalene was analyzed by 1H-NMR(270MHz, CDC13) ,<br>

poly(1-ethynyl-2—n-hexylnaphthalene) was obtained.<br>
[0064]<br>
(2)	Production of light control material and light control<br>
film<br>
The obtained poly(1-ethynyl-2—n-hexylnaphthalene) (5<br>
mg) was dissolved in 0.37 mL of chloroform so as to prepare<br>
a chloroform solution containing 0.9% by weight of the<br><br>
poly(1-ethynyl-2—n-hexylnaphthalene). Further, 1.5 mg of<br>
iron (III) chloride was added to the chloroform solution in<br>
an amount of 30% by weight relative to the poly(1-ethynyl-<br>
2—n-hexylnaphthalene), and stirred at room temperature for<br>
30 minutes, thereby a light control material was obtained.<br>
Furthermore, a light control material prepared by adding<br>
2.5 mg of iron (III) chloride (50% by weight relative to<br>
the poly(1-ethynyl-2—n-hexylnaphthalene)), and a light<br>
control material prepared by adding 1.5 mg of gold (III)<br>
chloride (30% by weight relative to the poly(1-ethynyl-2—n-<br>
hexylnaphthalene)), were also obtained. Light control<br>
films were obtained in the same manner as in Example 1,<br>
except that the thus obtained light control materials were<br>
used.<br>
[0065]<br>
The light transmitting properties of the obtained<br>
light control films are as shown in Fig. 3.<br>
According to Fig. 3, it is found that each of the<br>
light control films has a high absorption band in the<br>
infrared range, and the absorption wavelength changes<br>
depending on the amount of doping of the iron (III)<br>
chloride.<br>
[0066]<br>
(Example 3)<br>
(1)	Preparation of poly (1-ethynyl-2-n-butylnaphthalene)<br>
Preparation of l-ethynyl-2-n-butylnaphthalene was<br>
carried out in the same manner as Example 2, except that<br>
bromobutane was used in place of bromohexane, and by<br>
polymerizing the l-ethynyl-2-n-butylnaphthalene, poly(1-<br>
ethynyl-2-n-butylnaphthalne) was obtained.<br>
[0067]<br>
(2)	Production of light control material and light control<br>
film<br>
The obtained poly(1-ethynyl-2-n-butylnaphthalene) was<br>
dissolved in chloroform so as to prepare a chloroform<br><br>
solution containing 0.8% by weight of the poly(1-ethynyl-2-<br>
methylnaphthalene). Next, iron (III) chloride was added to<br>
the chloroform solution in an amount of 30% by weight<br>
relative to the poly(1-ethynyl-2-n-butylnaphthalene), and<br>
then stirred, thereby light control materials were obtained.<br>
Further, gold (III) chloride was added to the chloroform<br>
solution in an amount of 20% by weight relative to the<br>
poly(1-ethynyl-2-n-butylnaphthalene), and then stirred,<br>
thereby a light control material was obtained. The light<br>
control materials obtained above were each applied for<br>
coating on a glass substrate having a thickness of 0.1 mm<br>
by a spin coating method (800 rpm x 10 minutes), and dried<br>
at 30 °C for 1 hour to form coating films so that light<br>

[0068]<br>
(Example 4)<br>
(1) Preparation of poly (1-(2-naphthyl)-2-(4-<br>
pentylphenyl)acetylene)<br>

pentylphenylacetylene, 0.61 g of<br>
dichlorobis(triphenylphosphine)palladium, 0.63 g of<br>
triphenylphosfine, 0.62 g of copper iodide, and 4.55 g of<br>
2-bromonaphthalene, and reacted at 90°C for 3 hours. After<br>
removing the solvent by an evaporator, ethyl ether was<br>
added to the resulting solution to extract the generated<br>
compound. The ethyl ether layer was washed with 300 mL of<br>
distilled water for 3 times, dried over anhydrous magnesium<br>
sulfate for 24 hours, followed by filtration, and the<br>
solvents in the filtrate solution were removed by<br>
evaporation. The resulting product was purified on a<br>
column using hexane as a developing solvent, thereby 3.2 g<br>
of 1-(2-naphthyl)-2-(4-penthylphenyl)acetylene was obtained.<br>
The obtained 1-(2-naphthyl)-2-(4-penthylphenyl)acetylene<br><br>
was analyzed by 1H-NMR(27 0MHz, CDCl3) , and the NMR spectra<br>

penthylphenyl)acetylene (0.46 g) was polymerized with a<br>
TaCl5-nBu4Sn catalyst so that 0.25 g of poly(1-(2-<br>
naphthyl)-2-(4-penthylphenyl)acetylene) was obtained.<br>
[0069]<br>
(2) Production of light control material and light control<br>
film<br>
The obtained poly(1-(2-naphthyl)-2-(4-<br>
penthylphenyl)acetylene) was dissolved in toluene to<br>
prepare a toluene solution containing 0.8% by weight of the<br>
poly(1-(2-naphthyl)-2-(4-penthylphenyl)acetylene) as a<br>
light control material. The light control material<br>
obtained above was applied for coating on a glass substrate<br>
having a thickness of 0.1 mm by a spin coating method (800<br>
rpm x 10 minutes) , and dried at 30°C for 1 hour to form a<br>
coating film. The substrate on which the coating film was<br>
formed was exposed to nitric acid vapor for 10 minutes<br>
under normal temperature and normal pressure and, and then<br>
dried so that a light control film was obtained.<br>
Further, the poly(1-(2-naphthyl)-2-(4-<br>
penthylphenyl)acetylene) was dissolved in toluene to<br>
prepare a toluene solution containing 0.8% by weight of the<br>
poly(1-(2-naphthyl)-2-(4-penthylphenyl)acetylene), and gold<br>
(III) chloride was added to the toluene solution in an<br>
amount of 20% by weight relative to the poly(1-(2-<br>
naphthyl)-2-(4-penthylphenyl)acetylene), and then stirred<br>
so that a light control material was provided. The light<br>
control material obtained above was applied for coating on<br>
a glass substrate having a thickness of 0.1 mm by a spin<br>
coating method (800 rpm x 10 minutes), and dried at 30°C<br>
for 1 hour to form a coating film, thereby a light control<br>
film was obtained.<br><br>
The light transmitting properties of the obtained<br>
light control films are as shown in Fig. 5.<br>
[0070]<br>
(Example 5)<br>
The poly(1-ethynyl-2-methylnaphthalene) obtained in<br>
Example 1 was dissolved in toluene to prepare a toluene<br>
solution containing 1.0% by weight of the poly(1-ethynyl-2-<br>
methylnaphthalene) as a light control material.<br>
The obtained light control material was applied for<br>
coating on a glass electrode substrate having a thickness<br>
of 0.7 mm (surface resistance 100Ω) on which ITO was<br>
coated, by a spin coating method (800 rpm x 10 seconds),<br>
and dried at 30°C for 5 minutes to form a coating film,<br>
thereby a light control film was obtained.<br>
On the other hand, 1.0 g of lithium perchlorate was<br>
dissolved in 66 mL of propylene carbonate, and to the<br>
solution was added 3.3 g of polyethylene glycol (molecular<br>
weight of 300,000) so that an electrolyte was prepared.<br>
A layer of the electrolyte with a thickness of 100 µm<br>
was laminated on the glass substrate on which the coating<br>
film had been formed, and further, the glass electrode<br>
substrate on which ITO had been coated was laminated<br>
thereon, thereby a light control body was produced.<br>
[0071]<br>
Next, direct current voltages of 0, 1.2, 1.5, and 2.0<br>
were applied to the obtained light control body, and the<br>
transmittance was observed by a spectrophotometer (UV-<br>
3101PC, manufactured by Shimadzu Corporation). The light<br>
transmitting property of the light control body when each<br>

According to Fig. 6, it is found that each of the<br>
light control bodies exerts light control functions in a<br>
wide wavelength range when a voltage is applied. It is<br>
also found that, by adjusting the application voltage, the<br>
wavelength range of transmitted light or the transmittance<br><br>
can be controlled.<br>
[0072]<br>
(Example 6)<br>
The 1-(2-naphthyl)-2-(4-penthylphenyl)acetylene<br>
obtained in Example 4 was dissolved in toluene to prepare a<br>
toluene solution containing 0.75% by weight of the l-(2-<br>
naphthyl)-2-(4-penthylphenyl)acetylene as a light control<br>
material.<br>
The obtained light control material was applied for<br>
coating on a glass electrode substrate having a thickness<br>
of 0.7 mm (surface resistance 100Ω) on which ITO was<br>
coated, by a spin coating method (800 rpm x 10 seconds),<br>
and dried at 30°C for 5 minutes to form a coating film,<br>
thereby a light control film was obtained.<br>
On the other hand, 1.0 g of lithium perchlorate was<br>
dissolved in 66 mL of propylene carbonate, and to the<br>
solution was added 3.3 g of polyethylene glycol (molecular<br>
weight of 300,000) so that an electrolyte was prepared.<br>
A layer of the electrolyte with a thickness of 100 µm<br>
was laminated on the glass substrate on which the coating<br>
film had been formed, and further, the glass electrode<br>
substrate on which ITO had been coated was laminated<br>
thereon, thereby a light control body was produced.<br>
[0073]<br>
Next, direct current voltages of 0, 1.7, 2.2, and 2.5<br>
were applied to the obtained light control body, and the<br>
transmittance was observed by a spectrophotometer (UV-<br>
3101PC, manufactured by Shimadzu Corporation). The light<br>
transmitting property of the light control body when each<br>
of the voltages was applied was shown in Fig. 7.<br>
According to Fig. 7, it is found that each of the<br>
light control bodies exerts light control functions in a<br>
wide wavelength range when a voltage is applied. It is<br>
also found that, by adjusting the application voltage, the<br>
wavelength range of transmitted light or the transmittance<br><br>
can be controlled.<br>
[0074]<br>
(Example 7)<br>
A light control body was manufactured in the same<br>
manner as in Example 5, except that the poly(1-ethynyl-2-n-<br>
hexylnaphthalene)acetylene obtained in Example 2 was used.<br>
[0075]<br>
(Example 8)<br>
To 25 mL of a tetrahydrofuran solution of 3.05 g of<br>
ethynylnaphthalene was added 27.5 mL of a 1.6 mol/L hexane<br>
solution of n-butyl lithium at -50°C under a nitrogen<br>
atmosphere, and the mixture was cooled to -80°C, and then<br>
15 mL of a tetrahydrofuran solution of 2.25 g of potassium<br>
tert-butoxide was added thereto. After stirring at -80°C<br>
for 1 hour, the temperature was raised up to 5°C. At -70°C,<br>
4.42 g of bromodecane was dropped to the resulting solution,<br>
and stirred at 20°C for 2 hours. After addition of 150 mL<br>
of diethyl ether at 0°C, 50 mL of water was dropped to the<br>
resulting solution to extract the generated compound. The<br>
diethyl ether layer was washed with 50 mL of distilled<br>
water for 3 times, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate<br>
for 1 hour, followed by filtration, and the solvent was<br>
removed by evaporation. The resulting product was purified<br>
on a column using hexane as a developing solvent, thereby<br>
2.1 g of l-ethynyl-2-n-decylnaphthalene was obtained. The<br>
obtained l-ethynyl-2-n-decylnaphthalene was analyzed by 1H-<br>
NMR(270MHz, CDCl3) , and the NMR spectra showed peak at δ<br>
8.3(1H), 7.8(2H), 7.5(3H), 3.6(1H), 3.0(2H) 1.7(2H),<br>
1.3(16H), 0.9(3H).<br>
[0076]<br>
The obtained l-ethynyl-2—n-decylnaphthalene (1.0 g)<br>
was polymerized with a WC16 catalyst so that 0.6 g of<br>
poly(1-ethynyl-2—n-decylnaphthalene) was obtained. The<br>
obtained poly(1-ethynyl-2—n-decylnaphthalene) (0.5 g) was<br>
dissolved in toluene to prepare a toluene solution<br><br>
containing 1.0% by weight of the poly(1-ethynyl-2—n-<br>
decylnaphthalene) as a light control material. A light<br>
control body was produced in the same manner as in Example<br>
5, except that the thus obtained light control material was<br>
used.<br>
[0077]<br>
Next, direct current voltages of 0, 1.2, 1.5, and 2.0<br>
were applied to the obtained light control body, and the<br>
transmittance was observed by a spectrophotometer (UV-<br>
3101PC, manufactured by Shimadzu Corporation). The light<br>
transmitting property of the light control body when each<br>
of the voltages was applied was shown in Fig. 8.<br>
According to Fig. 8, it is found that each of the<br>
light control bodies exerts light control functions in a<br>
wide wavelength range when a voltage is applied. It is<br>
also found that, by adjusting the application voltage, the<br>
wavelength range of transmitted light or the transmittance<br>
can be controlled.<br>
[0078]<br>
(Example 9)<br>
To 20 mL of a tetrahydrofuran solution of 2.88 g of<br>
ethynylnaphthalene was added 25 mL of a 1.6 mol/L hexane<br>
solution of n-butyl lithium at -50°C under a nitrogen<br>
atmosphere, and the mixture was cooled to -90°C, and then<br>
12 mL of a tetrahydrofuran solution of 2.3 g of potassium<br>
tert-butoxide was added thereto. After stirring at -80°C<br>
for 1 hour, the temperature was raised up to 5°C. At -7 0°C,<br>
6.90 g of bromooctadecane was dropped to the resulting<br>
solution, and stirred overnight at 30°C. 100 mL of water<br>
was dropped to the resulting solution at 0°C, and hexane<br>
was added thereto to extract the generated compound. The<br>
hexane layer was washed with 30 mL of distilled water for 3<br>
times, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate for 24 hours,<br>
followed by filtration, and the solvent was removed by<br>
evaporation. The resulting product was purified on a<br><br>
column by using hexane as a developing solvent, thereby 1.5<br>
g of l-ethynyl-2-n-octadecylnaphthalene was obtained. The<br>
obtained l-ethynyl-2-n-decylnaphthalene was analyzed by 1H-<br>
NMR(270MHz, CDCl3) , and the NMR spectra showed peak at δ<br>
8.3(1H), 7.8(2H), 7.5(3H), 3.6(1H), 3.0(2H) 1.7(2H),<br>
1.3(32H), 0.9(3H).<br>
[0079]<br>
The obtained 1-ethynyl-2—n-octadecylnaphthalene (1.0<br>
g) was polymerized with a WC16 catalyst so that 0.5 g of<br>
poly(1-ethynyl-2—n-octadecylnaphthalene) was obtained. The<br>
obtained poly(1-ethynyl-2—n-octadecylnaphthalene) (0.5 g)<br>
was dissolved in toluene to prepare a toluene solution<br>
containing 1.0% by weight of the poly(1-ethynyl-2—n-<br>
octadecylnaphthalene) as a light control material. A light<br>
control body was produced in the same manner as in Example<br>
5, except that the thus obtained light control material was<br>
used.<br>
[0080]<br>
Next, direct current voltages of 0, 1.2, 1.5, and 2.0<br>
were applied to the obtained light control body, and the<br>
transmittance was observed by a spectrophotometer (UV-<br>
3101PC, manufactured by Shimadzu Corporation). The light<br>
transmitting property of the light control body when each<br>
of the voltages was applied was shown in Fig. 9.<br>
According to Fig. 9, it is found that each of the<br>
light control bodies exerts light control functions in a<br>
wide wavelength range when a voltage is applied. It is<br>
also found that, by adjusting the application voltage, the<br>
wavelength range of transmitted light or the transmittance<br>
can be controlled.<br>
[0081]<br>
(Evaluation)<br>
Each of the light control bodies obtained in Examples<br>
5 to 9 was evaluated for response and repetition durability<br>
according to the following methods.<br><br>
The results are as shown in Table 1.<br>
[0082]<br>
(1)	Response<br>
Color change in response to the change in voltage was<br>
visually observed, and the evaluation was performed based<br>
on the following criteria.<br>
o: Good response, Rapid color change<br>
Δ: Not good response, Certain time is required<br>
before development of color change<br>
x: Bad response, Long time is required before<br>
development of color change<br>
[0083]<br>
(2)	Repetition durability<br>
Application and non-application of a 2.5V voltage<br>
were repeated to test the durability, and the evaluation<br>
was performed based on the following criteria.<br>
O: Light control performance does not change at more<br>
than 10,000 times of repetition<br>
o: Light control performance does not change with<br>
about 5000 times of repetition, but significantly<br>
deteriorates after about 9,000 times of repetition<br>
Δ: Light control performance does not change with<br>
about 500 times of repetition, but significantly<br>
deteriorates after about 1,000 times of repetition<br>
x: Light control performance significantly<br>
deteriorates after about 500 times of repetition<br>
[0084]<br>
[Table 1]<br><br>
[0085]<br>
(Example 10)<br>
The poly(1-ethynyl-2—n-octadecylnaphthalene) prepared<br><br>
in Example 9 was dissolved in chloroform to prepare a<br>
chloroform solution containing 0.8% by weight of the<br>
poly(1-ethynyl-2—n-octadecylnaphthalene) as a light control<br>
material.<br>
The light control material obtained above was applied<br>
for coating on a glass substrate having a thickness of 0.7<br>
mm by a spin coating method (800 rpm x 10 minutes), and<br>
dried at 30°C for 5 minutes to form coating films, thereby<br>
light control films were obtained.<br>
The light control films obtained above were heated on<br>
a hot plate for 5 minutes at respective temperatures of<br>
150°C and 200°C. By using the heat-treated light control<br>
films, light control bodies were produced in the same<br>
manner as in Example 9. Transmittance of the light control<br>
bodies was observed by a spectrophotometer (UV-3101PC,<br>
manufactured by Shimadzu Corporation) before and after the<br>
heat treatment to obtain the light transmitting properties.<br>
The light transmitting properties are as shown in Fig. 10.<br>
Fig. 10 shows that the light control films can<br>
control the absorption wavelength in the visible light<br>
range by a heat treatment.<br>
[0086]<br>
A 2.0V direct current voltage was applied to the<br>
light control bodies heat treated as mentioned above, and<br>
the transmittance was observed by a spectrophotometer (UV-<br>
3101PC, manufactured by Shimadzu Corporation). The light<br>
transmitting properties of the light control bodies when<br>
voltage is applied thereto are as shown in Fig. 11.<br>
Figs. 10 and 11 show that the light control bodies<br>
can control the absorption wavelength in the visible light<br>
range without deteriorating the absorption properties in<br>
near-infrared range when they are heat treated.<br>
