				<td>CONTROL DEVICE FOR OPENING/CLOSING MEMBER<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
(1)	Field of the Invention<br>
[0001] The present invention relates to a control device for opening/closing<br>
member for opening/closing windows, sunroofs and the like of a vehicle.<br>
(2)	Description of the related art<br>
[0002] A power window device for opening/closing a window of a vehicle has<br>
been conventionally proposed. A safety function is provided to the power<br>
window device for entrapment of foreign objects such as hand by a window glass<br>
when opening/closing, in particular, when closing the window. Specifically, a<br>
function of monitoring a load of a motor that moves the window glass and<br>
judging that entrapment of foreign object by the window glass has occurred<br>
when variation of the load exceeds a threshold value defined in advance, and a<br>
function of stopping the movement of the window glass or moving the window<br>
glass in an opposite direction when judging that entrapment of foreign object has<br>
occurred are provided.<br>
[0003] A large load sometimes acts on the power window device at a specific<br>
position when opening/closing the window due to freeze-up. In the power<br>
window device provided with the safety function, judgment is made that<br>
entrapment of foreign object has occurred at such specific position, and thus the<br>
window cannot be fully opened or fully closed. A technique of preventing such<br>
event from occurring is proposed in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No.<br>
2004-143732 and Japanese Patent Publication No. 3578568. Japanese<br>
2<br><br>
Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 2004-143732 discloses a configuration of<br>
operating an operation switch to again close the window glass after judging that<br>
entrapment of foreign object has occurred and performing a stop or reverse<br>
control of the window glass (opening/closing member), where if the operation of<br>
the operation switch is repeated over a predetermined number of times when<br>
judgment that entrapment of foreign object has occurred is again made and the<br>
stop or reverse control of the window glass are repeated, the threshold used for<br>
judgment on whether or not entrapment of the foreign object has occurred is<br>
changed. When changing the threshold value, the initial first threshold value is<br>
changed to a second threshold value, with which judgment that the entrapment<br>
of the foreign object has occurred is more difficult to make than the first threshold<br>
value. Thus, even if a large load acts at a specific position due to freeze-up and<br>
the like when opening/closing the window, the window can be fully opened or<br>
fully closed. Furthermore, in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No.<br>
2004-143732, when a predetermined time has elapsed after changed to the<br>
second threshold value, the second threshold value is returned to the first<br>
threshold value. Moreover, Japanese Patent Publication No. 3578568<br>
discloses a configuration where when the stop or reverse control of the window<br>
glass is performed continuously over a predetermined number of times at<br>
substantially the same location if judged that entrapment of the foreign object<br>
has occurred, the entrapment judgment of the foreign object is not performed at<br>
a relevant location. Thus, the window can be fully opened or fully closed even if<br>
a large load acts at a specific position due to freeze-up and the like when<br>
opening/closing the window.<br>
[0004] A power window device with enhanced safety for infants also has<br>
3<br><br>
been proposed (see Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 11-268531).<br>
Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 11-268531 discloses a<br>
configuration of detecting whether or not a person seated is an infant by means<br>
of a pressure sensor arranged in a seat, and setting the threshold value to be<br>
used in the judgment on whether or not entrapment of foreign object has<br>
occurred smaller than in normal times or having the movement amount of the<br>
window glass in the opposite direction when judgment is made that entrapment<br>
of foreign object has occurred large if the infant is seated. Judgment that<br>
entrapment of foreign object has occurred is easily made with a small threshold<br>
value. In other words, setting the threshold value small will raise the sensitivity<br>
forjudging that entrapment of foreign object has occurred.<br>
[0005] However, in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No.<br>
2004-143732 and Japanese Patent Publication No. 3578568, control, with which<br>
judgment that entrapment of foreign object by the window glass has occurred is<br>
difficult to make, is performed so that the window can be fully opened or fully<br>
closed even if a large load acts at a specific position due to freeze-up when<br>
opening/closing the window. In such control, judgment that entrapment has<br>
occurred cannot be rapidly made if the arm or the like of the infant is entrapped.<br>
Therefore, safety with respect to infants cannot be sufficiently ensured with the<br>
configurations disclosed in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No.<br>
2004-143732 and Japanese Patent Publication No. 3578568. In Japanese<br>
Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 11-268531, the threshold value used in the<br>
judgment on whether or not entrapment of foreign object has occurred is always<br>
smaller than in normal times so that judgment on whether or not entrapment of<br>
foreign object has occurred can be easily made when the infant is seated, and<br>
4<br><br>
thus safety with respect to infants is ensured. However, since a configuration<br>
for detecting whether a person seated is an infant is required, such configuration<br>
becomes complicating and leads to increase in cost.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0006] It is an object of the present invention to provide a control device for<br>
opening/closing member capable of sufficiently ensuring safety with respect to<br>
infants with a simple configuration.<br>
[0007] In order to overcome the above problems, a control device for<br>
opening/closing member of the present invention has the following configuration.<br>
[0008] (1) A control device for opening/closing member includes a<br>
movement instruction outputting unit for outputting a movement instruction of the<br>
opening/closing member according to an operation of an operation switch; a<br>
driving unit for driving a motor and moving the opening/closing member based<br>
on the movement instruction of the opening/closing member output by the<br>
movement instruction outputting unit; an entrapment judging unit for judging<br>
whether or not entrapment of foreign object by the opening/closing member has<br>
occurred when the opening/closing member is being moved by the motor with a<br>
sensitivity set at a relevant point as a reference; a drive limiting unit for<br>
instructing the driving unit to stop the drive of the motor or drive in reverse<br>
rotation of the motor if judged that entrapment of the foreign object by the<br>
opening/closing member has occurred by the entrapment judging unit; and a<br>
sensitivity changing unit for raising the sensitivity forjudging that entrapment of<br>
the foreign object by the opening/closing member has occurred by the judging<br>
unit when the operation switch is repeatedly operated over greater than or equal<br>
5<br><br>
to a predetermined number of times within a predetermined time.<br>
[0009] In such configuration, the sensitivity changing unit judges that the<br>
infant is randomly operating the operation switch from curiosity, that is, the infant<br>
is playing with the operation switch when the operation switch is repeatedly<br>
operated for greater than or equal to a predetermined number of times (e.g., five<br>
times) within a predetermined time (e.g., five seconds), and raises the sensitivity<br>
forjudging that entrapment of foreign object by the opening/closing member has<br>
occurred. Thus, when an infant's arm gets entrapped while playing with the<br>
operation switch, judgment that entrapment has occurred can be rapidly made.<br>
Therefore, safety with respect to the infant can be sufficiently ensured. A<br>
configuration of judging whether the infant is playing with the operation switch<br>
can be realized with software, and thus increase in cost of the main body can be<br>
suppressed.<br>
[0010] (2) The sensitivity changing unit is a unit for changing the sensitivity<br>
of a load variation of the motor used in judging whether or not entrapment of the<br>
foreign object by the opening/closing member has occurred; and the entrapment<br>
judging unit is a unit forjudging whether or not entrapment of the foreign object<br>
by the opening/closing member has occurred based on whether the load<br>
variation of the motor exceeds the sensitivity of the load variation of the motor<br>
set at the relevant point.<br>
[0011 ] According to such configuration, the sensitivity for judging whether or<br>
not entrapment of the foreign object by the opening/closing member has<br>
occurred can be changed by changing the sensitivity of the load variation.<br>
[0012] (3) A control device for opening/closing member includes a<br>
movement instruction outputting unit for outputting a movement instruction of the<br>
6<br><br>
opening/closing member according to an operation of an operation switch; a<br>
driving unit for driving a motor and moving the opening/closing member based<br>
on the movement instruction of the opening/closing member output by the<br>
movement instruction outputting unit; and a drive limiting unit for limiting the<br>
movement instruction of the opening/closing member corresponding to the<br>
operation of the operation switch output by the movement instruction outputting<br>
unit when the operation switch is repeatedly operated over greater than or equal<br>
to a predetermined number of times within a predetermined time.<br>
[0013] According to such configuration, the drive limiting unit judges that the<br>
infant is randomly operating the operation switch from curiosity, that is, the infant<br>
is playing with the operation switch when the operation switch is repeatedly<br>
operated for greater than or equal to a predetermined number of times (e.g., five<br>
times) within a predetermined time (e.g., five seconds), and limits the movement<br>
instruction of the opening/closing member corresponding to the operation of the<br>
operation switch. For instance, when the closing operation of the<br>
opening/closing member is performed with the operation switch, such closing<br>
operation is invalidated and the movement of the opening/closing member by<br>
the driving unit is prohibited. The movement speed of the opening/closing<br>
member by the driving unit is set to low speed. Thus, similar to (1) described<br>
above, safety with respect to playing of operation switch of the infant can be<br>
ensured and increase in cost of the main body can be suppressed.<br>
[0014] (4) A control device for opening/closing member according to any<br>
one of claims 1 to 3, further including a notifying unit for notifying when the<br>
operation switch is repeatedly operated for greater than or equal to the<br>
predetermined number of times within the predetermined time.<br>
7<br><br>
[0015] According to such configuration, the playing of operation switch by the<br>
infant is rapidly notified to the guardian and the like. That is, the guardian and<br>
the like can rapidly respond to the playing of operation switch of the infant.<br>
[0016] According to the present invention, safety with respect to playing of<br>
operation switch of the infant can be ensured and increase in cost of the main<br>
body can be suppressed.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0018] An embodiment of a power window device applied with a control<br>
device for opening/closing member according to the present invention will now<br>
be described.<br>
[0019] FIG. 1 shows a view of a schematic configuration of a window<br>
opening/closing mechanism in a power window device according to an<br>
embodiment of the present invention. The window opening/closing mechanism<br>
opens/closes a window 100 by raising or lowering a window glass 101. The<br>
window glass 101 is raised or lowered by a motor 108 serving as an electrical<br>
motor. A supporting member 103 for supporting the window glass 101 is<br>
attached to the lower end of the window glass 101. A first arm 104 and a<br>
second arm 105 are engaged to the supporting member 103. The first arm 104<br>
has a first end engaging the supporting member 103 and a second end rotatably<br>
supported by a bracket 106. The second arm 105 has a first end engaging the<br>
supporting member 103 and a second end engaging a guide member 107. The<br>
first arm 104 and the second arm 105 are connected in a freely turning manner<br>
at a middle point as shown in the figure. A pinion 109 is rotatably driven by the<br>
motor 108. A gear 110 rotates by gearing with the pinion 109. As illustrated,<br>
the gear 110 has a fan shape. The gear 110 is fixed to the first arm 104. The<br>
motor 108 is rotatable in forward and reverse directions, where the pinion 109<br>
and the gear 110 are rotated through rotation in the forward and reverse<br>
directions to turn the first arm 104 in the forward and reverse directions.<br>
Following thereto, the second end of the second arm 105 is sled in a lateral<br>
10<br><br>
direction along a groove of the guide member 107. As a result, the supporting<br>
member 103 moves in an up and down direction and raises and lowers the<br>
window glass 101, thereby opening/closing the window 100. An encoder 108a<br>
is arranged in the motor 108.<br>
[0020] FIG. 2 shows a view of a configuration of main parts of the power<br>
window device of the embodiment. The power window device 1 of the present<br>
embodiment includes a control unit 2 for controlling the opening/closing of the<br>
window 100. The control unit 2 outputs an opening/closing command of the<br>
window 100 to a drive circuit 3. The drive circuit 3 drives the motor 108 based<br>
on the opening/closing command of the window 100 input from the control unit 2,<br>
and raises or lowers the window glass 101. A pulse detector 4 performs a<br>
waveform shaping process on an output signal of the encoder 108a arranged in<br>
the motor 108, and inputs a pulse signal performed with the waveform shaping<br>
process to the control unit 2. The control unit 2 detects a rotation speed of the<br>
motor 108 from a frequency of the pulse signal input from the pulse detector 4,<br>
and detects a load variation of the motor 108 from a frequency variation of the<br>
pulse signal. An operation unit 5 includes an operation switch 5a that is<br>
operated when opening/closing the window 100. The operation unit 5 inputs a<br>
signal corresponding to an operation state of the operation switch 5a to the<br>
control unit 2. There are five operation states of the operation switch 5a,<br>
neutral, manual open, automatic open, manual close, and automatic close.<br>
Neutral is a state in which the operation switch 5a is neutral. Manual open is a<br>
state in which a pushed amount of the operation switch 5a is within a constant<br>
range and automatic open is a state in which the pushed amount of the<br>
operation switch 5a exceeds the constant range. Manual close is a state in<br>
11<br><br>
which a pulled amount of the operation switch 5a is within a constant range and<br>
automatic close is a state in which the pulled amount of the operation switch 5a<br>
exceeds the constant range. The operation unit 5 inputs three logic signals,<br>
open signal, close signal and automatic signal, which change according to the<br>
operation state of the operation switch 5a, to the control unit 2. The control unit<br>
2 determines the operation state of the operation switch 5a from the three logic<br>
signals of open signal, close signal, and automatic signal.<br>
[0021] The control unit 2 performs the opening/closing operation of the<br>
window 100 by manual opening process, automatic opening process, manual<br>
closing process, and automatic closing process based on the operation state of<br>
the operation switch 5a. The manual opening process is a process in which the<br>
operation state of the operation switch 5a is at manual open to lower the window<br>
glass 101 until the window 100 is fully opened. The manual closing process is<br>
a process in which the operation state of the operation switch 5a is at manual<br>
close to raise the window glass 101 until the window 100 is fully closed. The<br>
automatic opening process is a process of lowering the window glass 100 until<br>
the window 100 is fully opened or until the operation state of the operation switch<br>
5a is at manual close or automatic close. The automatic closing process is a<br>
process of raising the window glass 101 until the window 100 is fully closed or<br>
until the operation state of the operation switch 5a is at manual open or<br>
automatic open. However, if judged that entrapment of foreign object by the<br>
window glass 101 being raised or lowered has occurred while opening/closing<br>
the window 100, the control unit 2 performs an error process of moving the<br>
window glass 101 in the opposite direction and stops the process being<br>
executed.<br>
12<br><br>
[0022] A function of judging whether or not entrapment of foreign object by<br>
the window glass 101 has occurred in the control unit 2 will now be described.<br>
The control unit 2 judges whether or not entrapment has occurred based on the<br>
frequency variation of the pulse signal obtained by waveform shaping the output<br>
signal of the encoder 108a in the pulse detector 4. The frequency of the pulse<br>
signal obtained by waveform shaping the output signal of the encoder 108a in<br>
the pulse detector 4 is proportional to the rotation speed of the motor 108. The<br>
drive circuit 3 maintains the power to supply per unit time to the motor 108<br>
constant while a command related to raising or lowering the window glass 101 is<br>
being issued from the control unit 2. Thus, the motor 108 rotates at a constant<br>
speed if there is no load variation. The control unit 2 judges that entrapment of<br>
foreign object by the window glass 101 occurred when the variation in frequency<br>
of the pulse signal exceeds a set threshold value (threshold value C). The<br>
variation in frequency of the pulse signal is a difference (B-A) between a<br>
frequency A at a relevant time point and a frequency B earlier by a constant (X1)<br>
time defined in advance.<br>
[0023] Entrapment of foreign object by the window glass 101 may be judged<br>
when the frequency of the pulse signal obtained by waveform shaping the output<br>
signal of the encoder 108a in the pulse detector 4 becomes lower than the<br>
frequency defined in advance. However, since the load on the motor 108 is<br>
changed by aged change of mechanism units shown in FIG. 1, environment<br>
temperature, and the like, judgment is more preferably made using the<br>
difference.<br>
[0024] The power window device 1 of the present embodiment judges<br>
whether the infant is randomly operating the operation switch 5a, that is, whether<br>
13<br><br>
the infant is playing with the operation switch 5a. If judged that infant is playing<br>
with the operation switch 5a, the sensitivity for judging that entrapment by the<br>
window glass 101 has occurred is raised. Raising the sensitivity means judging<br>
that entrapment of foreign object by the window glass 101 has occurred with<br>
smaller load variation. In other words, entrapment of foreign object by the<br>
window glass 101 is more easily judged. Specifically, the threshold value C is<br>
replaced from the normal value to a play value, which is a value smaller than the<br>
normal value, if judged that the infant is playing with the operation switch 5a.<br>
The power window device 1 of the present embodiment judges that infant is<br>
playing with the operation switch 5a when the operation switch 5a is operated<br>
over a predetermined number of times, five or more times in the present<br>
embodiment, within a predetermined time defined in advance, five seconds in<br>
the present embodiment. The predetermined time and the predetermined<br>
number of times may be arbitrarily set as long as they are hardly performed in<br>
the normal operation and playing of operation switch by infant can be rapidly and<br>
accurately detected. Therefore, occurrence of entrapment is rapidly judged<br>
when the window glass 101 entraps hand or foreign object such as sleeve of<br>
clothes of the infant playing with the operation switch 5a by raising the sensitivity<br>
if judged that the operation switch 5a has been played by the infant. Therefore,<br>
safety with respect to the playing of operation switch of the infant is ensured.<br>
[0025] The operation of the power window device 1 of the embodiment will<br>
now be described. The power window device 1 of the embodiment is activated<br>
when the ignition switch of the vehicle on which it is mounted is turned ON and is<br>
stopped when turned OFF. FIG. 3 shows a flowchart of the operation of the<br>
power window device. When the ignition switch is turned ON, the power<br>
14<br><br>
window device 1 starts the processes shown in FIG. 3. When the ignition<br>
switch is turned ON, the control unit 2 sets the threshold value C used in judging<br>
whether or not entrapment of foreign object by the window glass 101 has<br>
occurred to a normal value (s1). The control unit 2 then resets a counter<br>
counting the operated number of times of the operation switch 5a (s2). The<br>
processes of s1 and s2 are processes related to initial setting of a memory (not<br>
shown) arranged in the control unit 2. When the processes of s1 and s2 are<br>
completed, the control unit 2 performs the opening/closing process for<br>
opening/closing the window 100 according to the operation of the operation<br>
switch 5a until the ignition switch is turned OFF (s3, s4).<br>
[0026] FIG. 4 shows a flowchart of the opening/closing process in s3 of the<br>
power window device of the embodiment. The control unit 2 judges whether<br>
the operation state of the operation switch 5a input from the operation unit 5 is<br>
neutral (s11). If judged that the operation state is neutral in s11, the control unit<br>
2 ends the relevant process and judges whether or not the ignition switch is<br>
turned OFF in s4 described above. If the ignition switch is not turned OFF, the<br>
opening/closing process shown in FIG. 4 is again executed. In other words, the<br>
opening/closing process shown in FIG. 4 is repeatedly executed until the ignition<br>
switch is turned OFF.<br>
[0027] If judged that the operation state is not neutral in s11, that is, when<br>
some kind of operation is performed on the operation switch 5a, the control unit<br>
2 judges whether the count value of the counter (not shown) counting the<br>
operated number of times of the operation switch 5a is 0 (s12). If judged that<br>
the count value is 0 in s12, the power window device 1 resets a timer (not<br>
shown), starts timing by the timer (s13), and executes the processes after s14.<br>
15<br><br>
The counter and the timer are arranged in the control unit 2. If judged that the<br>
count value is not 0 in s12, the control unit 2 executes the processes after s14<br>
without performing the process of s13. The control unit 2 judges which<br>
operation state of the operation switch 5a is at, that is, whether at manual open,<br>
automatic close, manual close, or automatic close (s14 to s16), and proceeds to<br>
the opening/closing process of the window 100 corresponding to the operation<br>
state of the operation switch 5a judged at this stage (s17 to s20). Specifically,<br>
the control unit 2 proceeds to the manual opening process if the operation state<br>
of the switch 5a is manual open, and proceeds to the automatic opening process<br>
if the operation state is automatic open. Furthermore, the control unit proceeds<br>
to the manual closing process if the operation state is manual close and<br>
proceeds to the automatic closing process if the operation state is automatic<br>
close (if not manual open, automatic open, or manual close).<br>
[0028] The manual opening process, the automatic opening process, the<br>
manual closing process, and the automatic closing process will now be<br>
described in this order.<br>
[0029] FIGS. 5 and 6 show flowcharts of the manual opening process in the<br>
power window device of the embodiment. The control unit 2 judges whether or<br>
not the infant is randomly operating the operation switch 5a (whether the infant is<br>
playing with the operation switch 5a), and executes a sensitivity changing<br>
process of raising the sensitivity forjudging that entrapment by the window glass<br>
101 has occurred when the infant is playing with the operation switch 5a (s31).<br>
FIG. 7 shows a flowchart of the sensitivity changing process. The control unit 2<br>
judges whether the time timed by the timer is longer than or equal to a<br>
predetermined time defined in advance, that is, five seconds in the present<br>
16<br><br>
embodiment (s51). If the timed time is longer than or equal to five seconds, the<br>
control unit 2 resets the timer (s52), and sets the count value of the counter<br>
counting the operated number of times of the operation switch 5a to 1 (s53). In<br>
s52 and s53, the setting for counting the number of times the operation switch 5a<br>
has been operated during the five seconds or the predetermined time with the<br>
relevant timing as the reference is performed. If judged that the timed time is<br>
less than five seconds in s51, the control unit 2 counts up the count value of the<br>
counter counting the operated number of times of the operation switch 5a by 1<br>
(s54). In s54, the operated number of times of the operation switch 5a in a<br>
period until five seconds has elapsed from the timing that previously served as a<br>
reference is counted. The control unit 2 judges whether the operated number<br>
of times of the operation switch 5a that has been counted up by 1 in s54 is less<br>
than five times (s55). In s55, judgment is made on whether the operation<br>
switch 5a has been operated for five or more times during the five seconds. If<br>
judged that the operated number of times is less than five in s55, the control unit<br>
ends the present process. If the operated number of times is five or more, the<br>
control unit 2 judges that the infant is playing with the operation switch 5a, and<br>
sets the threshold value C used in judging whether or not entrapment of foreign<br>
object by the window glass 101 has occurred to the play value (s56), and then<br>
ends the process. According to the process performed in s56, the sensitivity for<br>
judging whether or not entrapment of foreign object by the window glass 101 has<br>
occurred is raised.<br>
[0030] After the sensitivity changing process is completed in s31, the control<br>
unit 2 judges whether or not the window 100 is fully opened (s32). If the<br>
window 100 is fully opened, the control unit 2 ends the present process. If the<br>
17<br><br>
window 100 is not fully opened, the control unit 2 makes a window opening<br>
instruction to the drive circuit 3 to drive the motor 108 in a direction of opening<br>
the window 100, that is, in a direction of lowering the window glass 101 (s33).<br>
The drive circuit 3 then drives the motor 108 to lower the window glass 101.<br>
The drive circuit 3 maintains the power supplied per unit time to the motor 108<br>
constant.<br>
[0031] After performing the window opening instruction in s33, the control<br>
unit 2 waits until the window 100 is fully opened (s34), entrapment of foreign<br>
object by the window glass 101 occurs (s35), the timed time of the timer reaches<br>
five seconds or longer (s36), or the operation state of the operation switch 5a<br>
changes from the manual open to another state (s37). If judged that the<br>
window 100 is fully opened in s34, the control unit 2 stops the window opening<br>
instruction on the drive circuit 3 (s38), and ends the present process. The drive<br>
circuit 3 stops driving the motor 108 when the window opening instruction is<br>
stopped by the control unit 2. If judged that entrapment of foreign object by the<br>
window glass 101 occurred in s35, the control unit 2 makes reverse rotating<br>
instruction instructing the reverse rotation drive of the motor 108 to the drive<br>
circuit 3 (s39). While the window 100 is being opened, judgment that<br>
entrapment of foreign object by the window glass 101 has occurred is made<br>
when the foreign object such as sleeve of clothes is pulled into an<br>
accommodating part of the window glass 101. In s39, instruction is made to the<br>
drive circuit 3 to drive the motor 108 in a direction of closing the window 100, that<br>
is, in a direction of raising the window glass 101. The drive circuit 3 drives the<br>
motor 108 in the direction of raising the window glass 101. The foreign object<br>
such as sleeve of clothes that had been pulled into the accommodating part of<br>
18<br><br>
the window glass 101 is thereby fed out from the accommodating part.<br>
Therefore, the foreign object entrapped in the window glass 101 can be easily<br>
removed. The control unit 2 waits for the window glass 101 to rise a constant<br>
amount defined in advance (s40), stops the reverse rotating instruction to the<br>
drive circuit 3 (s41), and ends the present process.<br>
[0032] The control unit 2 detects the load variation of the motor 108 and<br>
judges that entrapment of foreign object by the window glass 101 has occurred<br>
when the variation exceeds the set threshold value C. As described above, the<br>
control unit 2 judges that entrapment of foreign object by the window glass 101<br>
has occurred when the variation in the frequency of the pulse signal obtained by<br>
waveform shaping the output signal of the encoder 108 in the pulse detector 4<br>
exceeds the set threshold value C. The threshold value C used in the judgment<br>
in this case is either the normal value set at the relevant time point or the play<br>
value. The threshold value is set to the normal value when the ignition switch is<br>
turned ON. However, if judged that the infant is randomly operating the<br>
operation switch 5a or playing with the operation switch 5a in the sensitivity<br>
changing process described above after the ignition switch is turned ON, change<br>
of setting of replacing the threshold value C from the normal value to the play<br>
value is performed.<br>
[0033] If judged that the timed time of the timer has reached five seconds or<br>
longer in s36, the control unit 2 resets the counter counting the operated number<br>
of times of the operation switch 5a (s42), and returns to s34. After the counter<br>
is reset in s42, the process of s42 is performed every time judgment in s36 is<br>
performed, but this does not arise any problem. Furthermore, the judgment<br>
process in s36 may not be performed after the counter is reset in s42. That is,<br>
19<br><br>
after the counter is reset in s42, only the judgments in s34, s35, and s37 may be<br>
performed. The process in s36 thus will not be unnecessarily repeated, and a<br>
load of the control unit 2 can be reduced.<br>
[0034] If judged that the operation state of the operation switch 5a is<br>
changed from the manual open to another state in s37, the control unit 2<br>
executes the processes shown in FIG. 6. Judgment is made on whether a<br>
changed operation state of the operation state 5a is neutral, automatic open,<br>
manual open, or automatic close (s43 to s45). If the changed operation state of<br>
the operation switch 5a is neutral, the control unit 2 stops the window opening<br>
instruction to the drive circuit 3 (s46), and ends the present process. S46 is a<br>
process same as s38 described above. If the changed operation state of the<br>
operation switch 5a is one of automatic open, manual close, or automatic close,<br>
the control unit 2 proceeds to one of the automatic opening process, the manual<br>
closing process, or the automatic closing process corresponding to the relevant<br>
operation state (s47 to s49).<br>
[0035] The automatic opening process in the power window device of the<br>
present embodiment will now be described. FIGS. 8 to 11 show flowcharts of<br>
the automatic opening process. The control unit 2 executes the sensitivity<br>
changing process shown in FIG. 7 (s61). The control unit 2 judges whether the<br>
window 100 is fully opened (s62), and ends the present process if the window<br>
100 is fully opened. If the window 100 is not fully opened, the control unit 2<br>
makes the window opening instruction instructing the drive circuit 3 to drive the<br>
motor 108 in the direction of opening the window 100, that is, in the direction of<br>
lowering the window glass 101 (s63). The drive circuit 3 then drives the motor<br>
108 to lower the window glass 101. Subsequently, the control unit 2 performs<br>
20<br><br>
the processes similar to s34 to s42 described in the manual opening process in<br>
s64 to s72. However, in s67, judgment is made on whether the operation state<br>
of the operation switch 5a is changed to the state other than automatic open.<br>
[0036] If judged that the operation state of the operation switch 5a is<br>
changed from automatic open to another state in s67, the control unit 2 executes<br>
the processes shown in FIG. 9. Judgment is made on whether the changed<br>
operation state of the operation state 5a is neutral, manual open, manual close,<br>
or automatic close (s73 to s75). If the changed operation state of the operation<br>
switch 5a is either manual close or automatic close, the control unit 2 proceeds<br>
to the manual closing process or the automatic closing process corresponding to<br>
the relevant operation state (s76, s77). If the changed operation state of the<br>
operation switch 5a is neutral, the control unit 2 waits until the window 100 is fully<br>
opened (s78), entrapment of foreign object by the window glass 101 occurs<br>
(s79), the timed time of the timer reaches five seconds or longer (s80), or the<br>
operation state of the operation switch 5a changes from neutral to another state<br>
(s81).<br>
[0037] If judged that the window 100 is fully opened in s78, the control unit 2<br>
stops the window opening instruction to the drive circuit 3 (s82), and ends the<br>
present process. Furthermore, when detecting entrapment of foreign object by<br>
the window glass 101 in s79, the control unit 2 performs the processes in s39 to<br>
s41 described in the manual opening process in s83 to s85. Moreover, if<br>
judged that the timed time of the timer has reached five seconds or longer in s80,<br>
the control unit 2 resets the counter counting the operated number of times of<br>
the operation switch 5a (s86), and returns to s78,<br>
[0038] A case when the changed operation state of the operation switch 5a<br>
21<br><br>
is judged as manual open in s74 will be described hereinafter.<br>
[0039] If judged that the operation state of the operation switch 5a is<br>
changed from neutral to another state in s81, the control unit 2 executes the<br>
processes shown in FIG. 10. Judgment is made on whether the changed<br>
operation state of the operation state 5a is manual open, automatic open,<br>
manual close, or automatic close (s87 to s89). Judgment is made as automatic<br>
close if the changed operation state of the operation state 5a is none of manual<br>
open, automatic open, or manual close. If the changed operation state of the<br>
operation switch 5a is either manual close or automatic close, the control unit 2<br>
proceeds to the manual closing process or the automatic closing process<br>
corresponding to the relevant operation state (s90, s91).<br>
[0040] If the changed operation state of the operation switch 5a is automatic<br>
open, the control unit 2 executes the sensitivity changing process shown in FIG.<br>
7 (s93), and returns to s64. Since the sensitivity changing process is performed<br>
in s93, the operated number of times of the operation switch 5a can be<br>
appropriately counted, and as a result, judgment precision on whether or not the<br>
infant is playing with the operation switch 5a can be ensured. If the changed<br>
operation state of the operation switch 5a is manual open, the control unit 2<br>
executes the sensitivity changing process shown in FIG. 7 (s92). The control<br>
unit 2 waits until the window 100 is fully opened (s94), entrapment of foreign<br>
object by the window glass 101 occurs (s95), the timed time of the timer timing<br>
the judgment time reaches five seconds or longer (s96), or the operation state of<br>
the operation switch 5a changes from manual open to another state (s97). In<br>
this case as well, judgment precision on whether or not the infant is playing with<br>
the operation switch 5a can be ensured since the sensitivity changing process is<br>
22<br><br>
performed in s92. Furthermore, if judged that the changed operation state of<br>
the operation switch 5a is manual open in s74, the control unit 2 executes the<br>
processes after s94. The control unit 2 sometimes detects that the operation<br>
state of the operation switch 5a is temporarily at manual open when changing<br>
from automatic open to neutral. In this embodiment, this is not counted as the<br>
operated number of times of the operation switch 5a when changing from<br>
automatic open to manual open.<br>
[0041] If judged that the window 100 is fully opened in s94, the control unit 2<br>
stops the window opening instruction to the drive circuit (s98), and ends the<br>
present process. When detecting entrapment of foreign object by the window<br>
glass 101 in s95, the control unit 2 performs the processes of s39 to s41<br>
described in the manual opening process in s99 to s101. Furthermore, if<br>
judged that the timed time of the timer has reached five seconds or longer in s96,<br>
the control unit 2 resets the counter counting the operated number of times of<br>
the operation switch 5a (s102), and returns to s94.<br>
[0042] If judged that the operation state of the operation switch 5a is<br>
changed from manual open to another state in s97, the control unit 2 executes<br>
the processes shown in FIG. 11. Judgment is made on whether the changed<br>
operation state of the operation switch 5a is neutral, automatic open, manual<br>
close, or automatic close (s103 to s105). Judgment is made as automatic close<br>
if the changed operation state of the operation switch 5a is none of neutral,<br>
automatic open, or manual close. If the changed operation state of the<br>
operation switch 5a is neutral, the control unit 2 returns to s78. If the changed<br>
operation state of the operation switch 5a is automatic open, the control unit 2<br>
executes the sensitivity changing process shown in FIG. 7 (s106), and returns to<br>
23<br><br>
s64. Since the sensitivity changing process is performed in s106, judgment<br>
precision on whether or not the infant is playing with the operation switch 5a can<br>
be ensured. Moreover, if the changed operation state of the operation switch<br>
5a is manual close or automatic close, the control unit 2 proceeds to the manual<br>
closing process or the automatic closing process corresponding to the relevant<br>
operation state (s107, s108).<br>
[0043] The manual closing process in the power window device of the<br>
present embodiment will now be described. FIGS. 12 and 13 show flowcharts<br>
of the manual closing process. The control unit 2 executes the sensitivity<br>
changing process shown in FIG. 7 (s111). The control unit 2 judges whether or<br>
not the window 100 is fully closed (s112). If the window 100 is fully closed, the<br>
control unit 2 ends the present process. If the window 100 is not fully closed,<br>
the control unit 2 makes the window closing instruction of instructing the drive<br>
circuit 3 to drive the motor 108 in the direction of closing the window 100, that is,<br>
in the direction of raising the window glass 101 (s113). The drive circuit 3 then<br>
drives the motor 108 to raise the window glass 101.<br>
[0044] After performing the window closing instruction in s113, the control<br>
unit 2 waits until the window 100 is fully closed (s114), entrapment of foreign<br>
object by the window glass 101 occurs (s115), the timed time of the timer<br>
reaches five seconds or longer (s116), or the operation state of the operation<br>
switch 5a changes from the manual close to another state (s117). If judged that<br>
the window 100 is fully closed in s114, the control unit 2 stops the window<br>
closing instruction on the drive circuit 3 (s118), and ends the present process.<br>
The drive circuit 3 stops driving the motor 108 when the window closing<br>
instruction is stopped by the control unit 2. If judged that entrapment of foreign<br>
24<br><br>
object by the window glass 101 occurred in s115, the control unit 2 makes<br>
reverse rotating instruction instructing the reverse rotation drive of the motor 108<br>
to the drive circuit 3 (s119). While the window 100 is being closed, judgment<br>
that entrapment of foreign object by the window glass 101 has occurred is made<br>
when the foreign object such as finger or arm is entrapped by the window glass<br>
101 being raised and the windowsill. In s119, instruction is made to the drive<br>
circuit 3 to drive the motor 108 in the direction of opening the window 100, that is,<br>
in the direction of lowering the window glass 101. The drive circuit 3 drives the<br>
motor 108 in the direction of lowering the window glass 101. The control unit 2<br>
waits for the window 100 to be fully opened (s120), stops the reverse rotating<br>
instruction to the drive circuit 3 (s121), and ends the present process. Thus, if<br>
judged that entrapment of foreign object by the window glass 101 has occurred<br>
while closing the window 100, the control unit 2 fully opens the window 100.<br>
Therefore, the safety of when finger, arm, or the like is entrapped by the window<br>
glass 101 and the windowsill is ensured.<br>
[0045] If judged that the timed time of the timer has reached five seconds or<br>
longer in s116, the control unit 2 resets the counter counting the operated<br>
number of times of the operation switch 5a (s122), and returns to s114. After<br>
the counter is reset in s122, the process of s122 is performed every time<br>
judgment in s116 is performed, but this does not arise any problem.<br>
Furthermore, the judgment process in s116 may not be performed after the<br>
counter is reset in s122. That is, after the counter is reset in s122, only the<br>
judgments in s114, s115, and s117 maybe performed.<br>
[0046] If judged that the operation state of the operation switch 5a is<br>
changed from the manual close to another state in s117, the control unit 2<br>
25<br><br>
executes the processes shown in FIG. 13. Judgment is made on whether the<br>
changed operation state of the operation state 5a is neutral, automatic close,<br>
manual open, or automatic open (s123 to s125). If the changed operation state<br>
of the operation switch 5a is neutral, the control unit 2 stops the window closing<br>
instruction to the drive circuit 3 (s126), and ends the present process. If the<br>
changed operation state of the operation switch 5a is one of automatic close,<br>
manual open, or automatic open, the control unit 2 proceeds to one of the<br>
automatic closing process, the manual opening process, or the automatic<br>
opening process corresponding to the relevant operation state (s127 to s412).<br>
[0047] The automatic closing process in the power window device of the<br>
present embodiment will now be described. FIGS. 14 to 16 show flowcharts of<br>
the automatic closing process. The control unit 2 executes the sensitivity<br>
changing process shown in FIG. 7 (s131). The control unit 2 judges whether<br>
the window 100 is fully closed (s132), and ends the present process if the<br>
window 100 is fully closed. If the window 100 is not fully closed, the control unit<br>
2 makes the window closing instruction instructing the drive circuit 3 to drive the<br>
motor 108 in the direction of closing the window 100 (s133). The drive circuit 3<br>
then drives the motor 108 to lower the window glass 101. Subsequently, the<br>
control unit 2 performs the processes similar to s114 to s122 described in the<br>
manual closing process in s134 to s142. However, in s137, judgment is made<br>
on whether the operation state of the operation switch 5a is changed to the state<br>
other than automatic close.<br>
[0048] If judged that the operation state of the operation switch 5a is<br>
changed from automatic close to another state in s137, the control unit 2<br>
executes the processes shown in FIG. 15. Judgment is made on whether the<br>
26<br><br>
changed operation state of the operation state 5a is neutral, manual close,<br>
manual open, or automatic open (s143 to s145). If the changed operation state<br>
of the operation switch 5a is manual open or automatic open, the control unit 2<br>
proceeds to the manual opening process or the automatic opening process<br>
corresponding to the relevant operation state (s146, s147). If the changed<br>
operation state of the operation switch 5a is neutral, the control unit 2 waits until<br>
the window 100 is fully closed (s148), entrapment of foreign object by the<br>
window glass 101 occurs (s149), the timed time of the timer timing the judgment<br>
time reaches five seconds or longer (s150), or the operation state of the<br>
operation switch 5a changes from neutral to another state (s151). If judged that<br>
the window 100 is fully closed in s148, the control unit 2 stops the window<br>
closing instruction to the drive circuit 3 (s152), and ends the present process.<br>
Furthermore, when detecting entrapment of foreign object by the window glass<br>
101 in s149, the control unit 2 performs the processes in s119 to s121 described<br>
in the manual closing process in s153 to s155. Moreover, if judged that the<br>
timed time of the timer has reached five seconds or longer in s150, the control<br>
unit 2 resets the counter counting the operated number of times of the operation<br>
switch 5a (s156), and returns to s148.<br>
[0049] A case when the changed operation state of the operation switch 5a<br>
is judged as manual open in s144 will be described hereinafter.<br>
[0050] If judged that the operation state of the operation switch 5a is<br>
changed from neutral to another state in s151, the control unit 2 executes the<br>
processes shown in FIG. 16. Judgment is made on whether the changed<br>
operation state of the operation state 5a is manual close, automatic close,<br>
manual open, or automatic open (s157 to s159). If the changed operation state<br>
27<br><br>
of the operation switch 5a is manual open or automatic open, the control unit 2<br>
proceeds to the manual opening process or the automatic opening process<br>
corresponding to the relevant operation state (s160, s161). If the changed<br>
operation state of the operation switch 5a is automatic close, the control unit 2<br>
executes the sensitivity changing process shown in FIG. 7 (s163), and returns to<br>
s134. Since the sensitivity changing process is performed in s163, the<br>
operated number of times of the operation switch 5a can be appropriately<br>
counted, and as a result, judgment precision on whether or not the infant is<br>
playing with the operation switch 5a can be ensured.<br>
[0051] If the changed operation state of the operation switch 5a is manual<br>
close, the control unit 2 executes the sensitivity changing process shown in FIG.<br>
7 (s162). The control unit 2 waits until the window 100 is fully closed (s164),<br>
entrapment of foreign object by the window glass 101 occurs (s165), the timed<br>
time of the timer timing the judgment time reaches five seconds or longer (s166),<br>
or the operation state of the operation switch 5a changes from manual close to<br>
another state (s167). Since the sensitivity changing process is performed in<br>
s162, judgment precision on whether or not the infant is playing with the<br>
operation switch 5a can be ensured. Furthermore, if judged that the changed<br>
operation state of the operation switch 5a is manual close in s134, the control<br>
unit 2 executes the processes after s164. Since the control unit 2 sometimes<br>
detects that the operation state of the operation switch 5a is temporarily at<br>
manual close when changing from automatic close to neutral, this is not counted<br>
as the operated number of times of the operation switch 5a when changing from<br>
automatic close to manual close.<br>
[0052] If judged that the window 100 is fully closed in s164, the control unit 2<br>
28<br><br>
stops the window closing instruction to the drive circuit (s168), and ends the<br>
present process. When detecting entrapment of foreign object by the window<br>
glass 101 in s165, the control unit 2 performs the processes of s119 to s121<br>
described in the manual closing process in s169 to s171. Furthermore, if<br>
judged that the timed time of the timer has reached five seconds or longer in<br>
s166, the control unit 2 resets the counter counting the operated number of times<br>
of the operation switch 5a (s172), and returns to s164.<br>
[0053] If judged that the operation state of the operation switch 5a is<br>
changed from manual close to another state in s167, the control unit 2 executes<br>
the processes shown in FIG. 17. Judgment is made on whether the changed<br>
operation state of the operation switch 5a is neutral, automatic close, manual<br>
open, or automatic open (s173 to s175). If the changed operation state of the<br>
operation switch 5a is neutral, the control unit 2 returns to s148. If the changed<br>
operation state of the operation switch 5a is automatic close, the control unit 2<br>
executes the sensitivity changing process shown in FIG. 7 (s176), and returns to<br>
s134. Since the sensitivity changing process is performed in s176, judgment<br>
precision on whether or not the infant is playing with the operation switch 5a can<br>
be ensured. Moreover, if the changed operation state of the operation switch<br>
5a is manual open or automatic open, the control unit 2 proceeds to the manual<br>
opening process or the automatic opening process corresponding to the relevant<br>
operation state (s177, s178).<br>
[0054] Therefore, the power window device 1 of the present embodiment<br>
judges whether or not entrapment of foreign object by the window glass 101 has<br>
occurred by detecting the load variation of the motor 108 in the manual opening<br>
process, the automatic opening process, the manual closing process, and the<br>
29<br><br>
automatic closing process described above. Furthermore, if the operation<br>
switch 5a is operated for greater than or equal to a predetermined number of<br>
times within the predetermined time, judgment is made that the infant is playing<br>
with the operation switch 5a, and the threshold value C used in judging whether<br>
or not entrapment of foreign object by the window glass 101 has occurred is<br>
changed from the normal value to the play value to raise the sensitivity for<br>
judging whether or not entrapment by the window glass 101 has occurred.<br>
Therefore, whether or not entrapment of foreign object by the window glass 101<br>
has occurred is judged with the raised sensitivity if the infant is playing with the<br>
operation switch 5a, whereby safety with respect to playing of operation switch<br>
of the infant is ensured. Moreover, increase in cost of the main body can be<br>
suppressed since judgment on whether the infant is playing with the operation<br>
switch 5a is performed with software. If the infant is not playing with the<br>
operation switch 5a, whether or not entrapment of foreign object by the window<br>
glass 101 has occurred is judged with the normal sensitivity, and thus<br>
occurrence frequency of mistaken judgment of judging that entrapment of<br>
foreign object has occurred although entrapment of foreign object by the window<br>
glass 101 has not occurred can be suppressed and user-friendliness will not be<br>
lowered.<br>
[0055] In the power window device 1 of the present embodiment, the ignition<br>
switch is once turned OFF to return the threshold value C to the normal value<br>
when the threshold value C is set to the play value, but the following<br>
configuration may be adopted.<br>
(1) The threshold value C is returned from the play value to the normal<br>
value when the operation switch 5a has not been operated for longer than or<br>
30<br><br>
equal to a predetermined time.<br>
(2)	The threshold value C is returned from the play value to the normal<br>
value after a predetermined time has elapsed from when the threshold value C is<br>
set to the play value.<br>
(3)	The threshold value C is returned from the play value to the normal<br>
value after a predetermined time has elapsed from when the window 100 is fully<br>
opened or fully closed.<br>
[0056] In the above embodiment, the sensitivity is raised by changing the<br>
threshold value C from the normal value to the play value, but the threshold<br>
value C does not need to the changed, and the following configuration may be<br>
adopted.<br>
As shown in FIG. 18, when calculating the load variation of the motor 108,<br>
a difference between the load at the relevant point and the load earlier by normal<br>
time (X1) may be taken during normal times, and a difference between the load<br>
at the relevant point and the load earlier by played time (X2), which is longer<br>
than normal time (X1), be taken during played time. FIG. 18A shows the<br>
frequency of the pulse signal obtained by waveform shaping the output signal of<br>
the encoder 108a in the pulse detector 4 with respect to time axis, and FIG. 18B<br>
shows variation in load detected with respect to frequency variation shown in<br>
FIG. 18A. According to such configuration, the sensitivity can be raised, the<br>
safety with respect to playing of operation switch of the infant can be ensured,<br>
and increase in cost of the main body can be suppressed. User-friendliness<br>
can also be ensured. In this case, s1 shown in FIG. 3 is changed to the<br>
process of setting to the normal time X1, and s56 shown in FIG. 7 is changed to<br>
the process of setting to the played time X2.<br>
31<br><br>
[0057] Another embodiment of the present invention will now be described.<br>
In the embodiment described above, the sensitivity is raised if judged that the<br>
infant is playing with the operation switch 5a, and whether or not entrapment of<br>
foreign object by the window glass 101 has occurred is judged, but in the present<br>
embodiment, the movement speed of the window glass 101 during the<br>
opening/closing operation of the window 100 is set lower than normal if judged<br>
that the infant is playing with the operation switch 5a.<br>
[0058] Specifically, when making the opening/closing instruction to the drive<br>
circuit 3, the control unit 2 instructs the first electric energy or the second electric<br>
energy as the electric energy supplied to the motor 108 per unit time. The first<br>
electric energy is larger than the second electric energy. The drive circuit 3<br>
supplies the power of the first electric energy or the second electric energy<br>
instructed by the control unit 2 and drives the motor 108. Therefore, the<br>
rotation speed of the motor 108 is at higher speed when the power of the first<br>
electric energy is being supplied.<br>
[0059] The power window device 1 executes the process shown in FIG. 19<br>
when the ignition switch is turned ON. The processes shown in FIG. 19 are the<br>
same as FIG. 3 except that s1 of FIG. 3 described in the above embodiment is<br>
changed to a process (s201) of setting the electric energy supplied to the motor<br>
108 per unit time to the first electric energy. Furthermore, a movement speed<br>
changing process shown in FIG. 20 is executed in place of the sensitivity<br>
changing process in the above embodiment. The processes shown in FIG. 20<br>
are the same as FIG. 7 except that s56 of FIG. 7 is changed to a process (s202)<br>
of setting the electric energy supplied to the motor 108 per unit time to the<br>
second electric energy.<br>
32<br><br>
[0060] If judged that the infant is playing with the operation switch 5a, the<br>
movement speed of the window glass 101 when opening/closing the window<br>
100 is made lower than normal. Therefore, safety with respect to playing of<br>
operation switch of the infant can be ensured, and increase in cost of the main<br>
body can be suppressed. User-friendliness is also ensured.<br>
[0061] In this case, the sensitivity changing process in the manual opening<br>
process, the automatic opening process, the manual closing process, and the<br>
automatic closing process described in the above embodiment is replaced with<br>
the movement speed changing process shown in FIG. 20.<br>
[0062] If judged that the infant is playing with the operation switch 5a, the<br>
movement speed of the window glass 101 is set to be lower than normal in the<br>
manual closing process and the automatic closing process, and the movement<br>
speed of the window glass 101 is not set to low speed in the manual opening<br>
process and the automatic opening process.<br>
[0063] If judged that the infant is playing with the operation switch 5a, the<br>
control unit 2 may prohibit all of the manual opening process, the automatic<br>
opening process, the manual closing process, and the automatic closing process,<br>
or may prohibit the manual closing process and the automatic closing process<br>
and allow the manual opening process and the automatic opening process.<br>
The safety with respect to playing of operation switch of the infant is still ensured<br>
and increase in cost of the main body is suppressed. User-friendliness is also<br>
ensured.<br>
[0064] If judged that the infant is playing with the operation switch 5a, a<br>
warning lamp may light up or a notification may be made by warning sound.<br>
For instance, the room lamp may be light up as the warning lamp, or the hazard<br>
33<br><br>
lamp may light up as the warning lamp. The horn may be honked as the<br>
warning sound.<br>
[0065] In this case, the sensitivity changing process shown in FIG. 7 may be<br>
the process shown in FIG. 21. The sensitivity changing process shown in FIG.<br>
21 is the same as FIG. 7 but a step (s203) of notifying playing of operation switch<br>
by the infant is added following s56. The playing of operation switch by the<br>
infant is thus rapidly notified to the guardians. That is, the guardians can<br>
rapidly respond to the playing of operation switch by the infant. Therefore,<br>
similar to the above embodiment, the safety with respect to playing of operation<br>
switch of the infant is ensured, and increase in cost of the main body is<br>
suppressed. User-friendliness is also ensured.<br>
[0066] s203 is executed following s56, but may be executed in place of s56.<br>
Furthermore, s203 may be executed following s202 shown in FIG. 20, or may be<br>
executed in place of s202.<br>
[0067] The present invention has been applied to the power window device<br>
in the above embodiment, but the present invention is also applicable to a device<br>
for opening/closing sunroofs, and the like.<br>
[0068] The window glass 101 may be stopped instead of being reverse<br>
rotation driven if judged that entrapment has occurred. The judgment on<br>
whether or not entrapment has occurred, or reverse rotation drive or stopping of<br>
the window glass 101 if judged that entrapment has occurred may be prohibited<br>
in the manual opening process and the automatic opening process, and<br>
performed only in the manual closing process and the automatic closing process.<br>
