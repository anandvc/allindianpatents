Ofi-3 approach nas been to devebp improved system?; for transmitting loads .:; \B seat track;;, of vehicle seating assemblies. A growing number of applications, ;o.' ever, ernplcy .'attachment of seating components direct'y to the vehicle t&gt;ody in :h e for load distribution to the oody m white. For the improved seat track :.:c: nolocjy to 'JO viable in the latter applications, it wvould require substantial ■c :ification, Yvhioh is believed wouid unduly complicate the manufacturing TC'-fcdures, requiTr the development of expensive new processing techniques, or rf:; substantias v-'Gight to the vehicles. Accordingly, there is a need for an improved, i.-ui.iily msnufac^ired seating system that is capable of meeting vehicle manufacturer .■.3:-;cjn crneria ciic. government standards fcr vehicles, and which can be efficiently<br><br>
aiki convenient; y adapted for use in a variety of applications including those involving sent track load distribution, body in white load distribution or both.<br>
In addition to having load bearing characteristics, ft may he desirable for ■suiting system-;; to include one or mora additional functional features, ordinarily p£i.-:kagec: elsey.tie-re (e.g., in other locations ol a vehicle).

^Bi: ailed Description of the Preferred E-Imbotiiment<br>
Rel'errincj to Figs. 1 and 2, the present invention is premised upon the :'3\'?lopm'3nl of a;* improved seating assembly 10 having a plastic seat back 12<br>
tcltiding a first ;:iar.ei portion 14 secured tc and opposing a second pane! portion 16.<br>
i   one   particularly   preferred   embodiment   (although   net   necessarily   in   all<br>
;r:odiments) erf the present invention, the first pane! portion 14 is manufactured .:;*!.■ "irately frori ihe second panel portion 16 and the two are joined together.   In<br>
nolier embod-mtnt, the seat back is melded (e.g., bicw-moided) to integrally<br><br>
incorporate the first panel portion and t.e second panel portion 16. Additional panel :p:\bns nay also be included, and may be fabricated differently from or integrally !vi::h sithe; or boih of the first or second panel portions. The panel portions may be ru-Js of any si likable material, including but not limited to metal, plastic (including ^i. forced or untsinforced plastic), other composite material or otherwise. :,r;;,ferab!y, at lecst one of the panel portions is plastic. More preferably, the first and he second panel portions are plastic. In a particularly preferred embodiment, all ;2i tsl portions ar-3 plastic.<br>
Tho employment of microceilular foam plastics is also contemplated within the ■C'.:;J6 of :he pxs&amp;r.t invention. In accordance therewith, a gas/polymer solution is or iec, and tha :&gt;o:ution is rendered thermodynamically unstable in order to nucleate ,ii;:'ovoids. The* growth of nuclei is then controlled as desired.<br>
It is pc:;-£.ible to make one or more of the portions using arf-cisclosed .at:iiniqu©3 for :he Fabrication of the material selected. Thus, for example, one or nee of the.poit'ons may be formed, molded, machined or othen/vise configured to ic desired sha;:»e.. Where the portions 3re plastic, it is possible to use any suitable lici: .tic fabrication technique including, without limitation, injection molding (including ;Li! not lirriterj ic externa! or internal gas injection molding), blow molding, ,0- ipresson molding, rotational molding, thermoforming, extruding, vacuum forming, •on riing-in-piace or otherwise. Accordingly, as can be appreciated, in one J.T )odim€»nt, hybrid seat assemblies can be fabricated, thereby taking advantage of lie; benefits of different respective materials and different respective fabrication eciiniquo:*, an-:;! also advantageously permitting for the ability to design additional 3b ures or otherwise package components into any space between the panel ■or ions. In or us iumbodimont, the first panel portion is a first material, and the ;c:::nd peine! potion is a second matenal that is different from the first maleial. In ,ri:.tner embodiment, the material is the same in both portions, in both of the above, ;K: fabrication technique for each of the panel portions may be the same or different. ■y A'ay of iHustie t;on, in one particularly preferred embodiment, the entire saat back i ;i,rmec. by blow molding. In another embodiment, an injection molded pcrtion will ;2 cined with aiclher portion made with the same or a different technique. For ■ :•;

2)	A. blow molded portion of a first material joined with an injection molded portion of the first material;<br>
3)	h thermoforrned portion cf a first materia! joined with an injection molded portion of a second material;<br>
4)	h. tiiermoforrned portion cf a first materia! joined with an injection molded portion of the first material;<br>
5)	Ar: injection molded portion of a first material joined with a portion that employs the first material but is made from a technique selected from the group consisting of compression molding, thermoforming, e-xt-uding, vacuum forming, and foaming-in-place; or<br>
6)	An injection molded portion of a first material joined with a portion that employs a second material and is made from a technique se'ftcted from the croup consisting of compression molding, triermcformir.g, extruding, vacuum forming, and foaming-in-place.<br>
In yet another preferred embodiment, a first material is injection molded to ■;•■ i the ftst per:fo;i, and a second material (which may be the same as o\' different y\ the first (Material) is injection molded to form the second portion. The first D ion and "he s^c::&gt;nd portion are then secured to each other.<br>
This first panel portion 14 optionally may be secured to the second panel r ton 1*3 employing one or more joints 18 of any suitable structure; In some Tihodimenis there may be nc joint at all. in the embodiment shown, the joints 18 rerably are afesive joints, however, other suitable attachments (e.g.. as a result ■' ;■ tack-off) may be employed in lieu of or in combination with the adhesive. One Terred adhesive joint will employ an adhesive in contact w'th the entire opposing in ng su/facei of die respective pane! portions (e.g., about substantially the entire 3 ohery). Kvv/^/er. anctier joint contemplates intermittent placement cf the d" = sive for contacting selected portions of the opposing joining surfaces (e.g., trmittentiy s;xiCod about the periphery).    In another embodiment, it may be<br><br>

According to preferred embodiments of the present invention, •7S.li thicknesses- may vary between about 1 mm and 4 mm, and mere preferably behveen about :2.0 mm and 3.0 mm and section thicknesses may vary between i:b::-!Jt 10 mm an;i 1 DO mm, and more preferably between 20 mm and 35 mm.<br>
Tht3 phrase "integrated reinfo'cement structure" shall refer to a location ,.,'h: re, as sho.vn i'\ Fig. 2 (and FIG, 25), the first wall 36 and second wall 40 of a iclied compci:sn:: are joined, enlarged or reduced in wall thickness, section nic-cness, or cihsr.vis© configured to effectively create a beamed structural section : &gt;r creating a bcsliy modified bending moment or otherwise imparting additional i gfuly, toughness or impact resistance to a seat back assembly.<br>
8y way ol further references to FIG. 2, various different structural o::&gt;r -igurat-oris ars shown, one or more of which can be employed in the design of iw- bac^s for 'rz\ present invention,, it will be appreciated that the ability to s;.:i'p.-rate!y mold and assemble different panel portions allows for a wide design ho.:'scape. Fc ristance, the JISO of molding processes such as injection molding <.ilcws the ability to design in various section profiles including for instance variable t: section-: continuously incrementally or both></.ilcws>
Furi her, the present invention contemplates thai reinforcing structures, hshiners, hook:;, handles, or other utilitarian or ornamental features are insert rol:'&amp;d in the oiiaslic portion jsing art-disclosed insert molding techniques. For insti nee, a bright (s.g.. chromed) bezel, a soft touch surface (e.gf| textile or leather* j: "ic::od or not) or ether trim might be insert molded to be exposed en a surface of tl'3 oorticn. An dentif cation badge (e.g., a logo or namepiate) might be insert n ;:)!;ed as well. Tie downs, baggage hooks or the like might be molded to be s.;pi:sed tc view. Also, it is possible to include a reinforcement member (e.g., made o s:3el, macnesiurr^ composite, foam, carbon fibre or otherwise) insert maided or c'!u wise fabricat-sri or placed within the portion and not exposed to view.<br>
Aspects ol the disclosure herein have focused on seat backs that are c:-n::i"meted from plural portions that are joined together. Such aspects of the present lr /e:.tion 
 <br>
'p '!o* 1:0 meld ng, by defining tooling for achieving a certain blow molded structure or tl e .ke).<br>
Oris prewired embodiment contemplates that at Isasl one of the portions it oJu-ies a suite!; Ie&gt; reinforcing structure thai is molded integrally into the portion. Flefi-rring again to FIG* 2, one such configuration includes a rib configuration 42, r -vhig a plurality of wails 44 (shown optionally in contact with the wall 40 that are si;31: &amp;d apjart to e fa;;tively define a beam structure. Another illustrative configuration ;roi\i:es a rib 3l::*jc:.ire 46 having continuously sloping curved walls 48. Yet another ii!.,is:*ative confi::| action includes a single wall rib 50. Still anot.ner configuration may if oluie an enlarged rib 52 (Le. having an enlarged portion en one or more of its s\.:e::) or seme otiiur like configuration. Another configuration includes a wall portion 3■;. i at has a different wall thickness relative to an adjoining wail portion.<br>
The present invention contemplates the use of,the present integrated r&gt;; ia:)rcem-3nt siyurtures for imparting additional rigidity: toughness or impact r«: :•;(:; :ance to a :&gt;e:;ii back assembly, or otherwise locally modifying the bending iror: onx of a structure.<br>
As indicated previously, preferably, the first pane! portion 14 is secured to the ■3.:o:nd pane,' pcrlion 16, to define one or more open internal spaces 56 between the :..im;i portions 14; 115, Prior to, or during the time that the pane! portions 14. 16 are 5.;c.red icgeth&amp;r. one cr more components may be packaged within the open :3j-a::=s 56. Alternatively, the structure of a desired component might be actually noI::=:d into on
By way c: i iteration, in one exemplary embodiment, a cress section of which iSi sr^wn in F:iG. 2A, a seat back 12' has a first pane! portion 14", a second panel p"1');i 16' and &amp; jc.'rt 18'. Ribs 42'define a channel CO for functioning as a duct arid •: jT.iT.uniCctting n\: hrough a grille, louver,.or other suitable vent opening 62 (which n*::iy be openablo'i r.tegrally defined in or otherwise attached to one or both of the p:rt'Os 14' or ■Ji;.'. A hose frting cr other suitable attachment (e.g., a male-female ;a!a:::ment, a quick connect attachment or the like), may connect the channel 60<br><br>
/,v;l; a source o; air, such as a. duct routed along the floor, along a vehicle console, hr-ugh door panels, or a combination.<br>
Though \*he above discusses integral formation of components, it s also •c;*.;b!e the! s-p-rately fabricated components may be made and assembled into hr spaces between paneis prior to securing the panels to each other. For example, « :otor nay be installed. A heating or cooling unit (e.g., a resistive unit, a !K. moelectric device or the liKe) may be installed. A speaker for a sound system rit: / be Installed. Entertainment devices may be installed. A communications device vie. f be inste led. A global positioning sensor may be installed. Other like ■.opponents may l-e installed as well {e.g., transducers, solenoids, sensors, air bag opponents, liyrdng, wi'ring harnesses, pumps, seat belt tensicners, seat belt et* actors, seal belt webs, tethers, compass, thermometer, or the like), li is also :o:-:.3ible 1o fill the space with sounc deadening materials or other materials for oc jclng noise or vibration.<br>
Addition.:!*/., in one embodiment, one or more of the seat back portions is i o-i:igurecl to support, receive or define other components such as a picnic tray, !;;»Ci!3 (e.g., jire chisnge kits), a tonnesu cover, a ski rack, an arm rest, a foot rest, i.a:;:' rest a n-jcliner, flooring, cosmetic features, cargo nets/restraints, supportive !o::<s o:enin and closing panels assistive devices for persons with disabilities rdistahls features papers owner manuals map pockets fluid or paper ::is:="tins!ri{j" cup hoicers storage containers expandable no the like.></s>
In another e.mbodiment a transparent opening is defined in the seal: back. : h:: opening may he hollow or it may be solid (e.g., a transparent plastic, such as •-o j carbonate, or glass v/indcw), for Improving the visibility range for the vehicle '*0'-:;alor.<br>
Separately fabricated components nay be supported within the seat back 12<br>
isi.g any severs-1 different techniques.  In one example, one or mere of tho panels<br>
4  16 of the sea:; back 12 may be adapted to receive one or more fasteners or other<br>
: !t;:hmerts, vri:;h can support the modules.  In this regard, it may be desirable to<br>
iciJ a bess or insert mold a nut, a stud, a bolt or the like into the panel portion.<br><br>
' Alternatively, the first and second panels 14, 16 may be designed tc frictionally c::ic;nge tho corn pen ent, or otherwise nestably receive the component to contain it vithn one or mere cif the open spaces 56. in another embodiment the first panel 14, t ,e second pant?! 18 or both are molded with the component within it. For instance, tiS ;ompcnent ibsef (e.g., an encapsulated component, such as an encapsulated e -3*:: ronic device;) is an insert for insert molding.<br>
Optonallv, ore or both of the panel portions 14, 15 nay respectively include a f.-.in*e that extends about at least a portion of its periphery, or some other structure f:;r Increasing s..rfa::;e area to which a'i adhesive may be applied, in Figure 2, for €<: si fiance is formed on panel portion as will be appreciated from the ci.si.jssion further herein i also possible to form joints using integrated kin structures or sone other intermediate structure a rigid member. c gj- sket orothe></:>
As an aocieci advantage, the different forming techniques and parlicuiary iiijei-tion nrioWir.c. cen allow the panel portions to be designed more easily to include on" cured surfeicK&amp;s. such that the seat back can be better fit within the vehicle and iic iase passencer and cargo space within a vehicle. Additionally, the techniques |.emit for the eibility to add shoulder wings for accommodating wheel wells, or cer: ral disposed v/hgs to meet above an arm rest or a center pass through door. I.elijrring io Fie. ;2B, there is a pair of molded sealbacks 56 formed with opposing I arils ac:ordii"io to the present invention.

It will be appreciated that in either the forward or rearward portion there can :■&amp;■:) be molded ar.y of a varie?/ of functional features as well, such as guide tracks or receiving acLlilicnal components, cup holders, work or rest surfaces, or the like.<br>
if employ 3d, the adhesive used to join panel portions 14, 16 may be any -;IT able adhesive. Preferably it is a urethan© based adhesive, and more preferably a ..n;:.hane adheres. Alternatively, the adhesive may include a functional component ■e isted Irotn aayoni'irile butadiene slyrere (ABS), polycarbonate (PC), era mixture hooof (e.g. Pw-ABS), In a further alternative embodiment the adhesive is a silane ;.d esive, a siiiorvu adhesive or a mixture thereof. In yet another embodiment, the id'-osive is an acrylic adhesive. The achesive may be epoxy based. It may include :c /olefin cs, styrfcnics, acryiics or mixtures thereof, in yet another embodiment, a inferred adhesive includes; alkyl borane.

Integrated reinforcement fracture patterns} 86 include a plurality of individual integrated reinforcement Ti.ctures 20. .H.; seen in Fig. 3F and 3G, without limitation, the individual integrated ■sii forcem&amp;nt savtfure 20 may be a composite of multiple component shapes. The al erns S6 ITKJV be random, as seen in FIG. 3B and 3G; o; repetitious, as seen in ■K! S. 3A or 3E. One or mora different type of integrated reinforcement structures 20 ■f! i3 typo iliusihrxd in FIG. 2 may be employed to define each pattern 86 used in a e,i-: back 12.<br><br>
The reinforcement structures of the seat back 12 may be formed in a variety ;rf manners. Referring to FIG. 2, the reinforcement structures may be formed of too ■racing cr corresponding ponions, thai are respectively attached to each of the pane! ;<ci irons thus when the pane portions ars adhered together may be accomplished by contacting a reinforcement structure with and bonding it tc an opposing surface of another panel portion :c-responding meet are attached adhesive joint thereby on ring such as structures .r sternsdwily however illustrated bt formed almost entirely part ona .-r to securir.c: thereafter alrjrture i>e joined to the other panel portion 14, 15 with a '■■so Jiting acheswo joint 13, either about some or all of the periphery of the panel &gt;c ;ions, wiihir "hi: space defined between the opposing panel portions, between a enforcement structure and an opposing pane! portion, or otherwise.<br>
In je"si£-n cf the integrated reinforcement structure pattern, the location of the ;p: nings is praferabiy staggered to help reduce or eliminate-hinge points. Further, ■vL-re a plurality of vertically oriented integrated reinforcement structures is used in a ;a;em, the he rental spacing (V in FIG, 3A) between each individual integrated ■si-.forcerlent t;:ru:;;ture will V;ary from about 5 mm to afcojt 100 mm and more :ni!,:erably about 20 mm to about 50 mm.<br>

When employed with ver.icaHy orieried integrated reinforcement structures, the horizontally oriented . ib: cjratec reinrcrcement structures 83 preferably are staggered between vertically orknted htegnst-u:! reinforcement structures 90 or otherwise located to help reduce ' ■«;« iikelnood lh-;?y will servo as a hinge point- (See, e.g., FIG. 3G).

The design and location of each Integrated reinforcement structure 20 and };:,:;om 85 fabricated in the seat back 12 may be optimized for each individual application, iak:ng into account some or all of the following criteria. For e3ch replication, the skilled enisan will appreciate that the specific integrated nirrorcsmerrt sirucairo employed is configured to heip minimize the bending or }-iri':;.3. effect caused by loads, resulting from rapid deceleration or acceleration of a vehicle in the presence of a passenger or cargo behind a seat (e.g., that which *;.<pi by a top mounted center shoulder belt child seat anchors iiric iuggaye intrusion for instance in one preferred embodiment the integrated i lirorcement slruc:-:ure and pattern selected generally that will pcs on of :he reinforcement structure having higher bending moment if pcsltion general perpendicular to torsional diagonal plane.></pi>
The use of integrated reinforcement structures is further illustrated in the ioibjvir.g discusE;i:n, by reference fc
For a number of applications, it is particularly ©tractive to incorporate an iivx-^rated reinforcement structure around at least a portion of the perimeter 94 of the .■ittc;:: back 12 to h&amp;Ip increase horizontal stiffness, vertical stiffness, or boih in the I ai.r.etor regies; cf the seat back. With illustrative reference to FIG. 3A, for most .•■ pp» isations it i;&gt; contemplated that an outboard edge 96 of the integrated i wvoroerr.ent ssiruaure 20 is at or within about 50 mm (and more preferably about '3 rim) cr lesfi cf an edge defining the perimeter 94 of the seat back 12. With ■"-rJier reference* tc FIG. 2, the width fw") of any integrated reinforcement structure \M--i in the perifi-kr.er regions of a seat back preferably ranges up to about 30mm, ,:-nrl more prefersb!;,' it is about 4 to about 20 mm. Such dimension helps to minimize i-.onjing in the racossed vailey portion 1C0.<br>
It is a'so p'cerable to form an integrated reinforcement structure in th-3 vicinity o: ;;in.y latch stn'vor: or latch members. In some applications, such as where the seat<br><br>
is ntended to cany the lead for a center belt, or a child seat tether, it may be durable to r;i:HJr/, further. reinforces or eliminate the top perimeter horizontally oriented integrrteci reinforcement structure to reduce the potential for hinge effect .sit.-tjss concentrator in that vicinity. By reference to FIGS. 4A and 4B (which show ilii strativc-! hinga structures), in these applications and others, the bottom end 102 of a vertically oriented perimeter integrated reinforcement structure 104 wiii be petitioned beiow the highest point 106 of a hinge assembly bracket 108 or other »enforcement I'll) (e.g., internally positioned) securing the seat back to the vehicle. .VI:: re preferably, the overlap ("O") will range from about 25% to as high as about 1 (:*:)% of the vertical length ("LH") of any hinge or reinforcement. Further, the nop end •|i:i of sush vertic&amp;! perimeter integrated reinforcement structure will be spaced from ;e j,, within about 10 to about 200 mm of) the top of the seat Alternatively, a thicker Oci,t section thiol ;r ess as available by the use of structures 52 or 54 of FIGS. 1 and 2, nay te Incorporated at the top or bottom of the seat back to help increase st'frhess.<br>
It sftoulrl be recognized that the present invention advantageously also ■::€nrnits for ins;=:ir; molding of brackets or other hardware for securing the seat jic-inpon&amp;it to ihs vehicle.<br>
In nstarcas* where a center passenger shoulder belt system is employed, or a w.. chile seat .ether is employed, optionally, design criteria is employed to help eouce the forward, downward and torsional or diagonal bending of the seat back '■hi-t are caused by perimeter loads at or adjacent the shoulder belt or tether jtl.ichmeits. Preferably the integrated reinforcement structures will provide good ■/eiiical sliflheas (.=is this is the plane that is anticipated to endure the more severe sending forces), as well as cood torsional stiffness (responsive to the diagonal offset ■3.:i;j5 a passenyer Imparts to a shoulder belt system). In such instances, it is .;.-;; ferablo to alternate geometries of the integrated reinforcement structures: either in a jandom or pnscetermined pattern, or to maintain the integrated reinforcement -structure width ip to about 40 mm, and more preferably up to about 30 mm (e.g., ifcic Mjt 5 to about 30 mm).<br>
Ths ernptoy.'neni of vertically oriented integrated reinforcement structures is •'.aiLcularly preffirrsd in the load path for center belt loads and upper chid so3t<br><br>
tethers to help avoid vertical bending Preferably, for these applications, the iiiteujrated reinforcement structure width (W) will vary up to about 50 mra and more f: re drably will be abouc 4 to about 40 mm, and still more preferably will be about 15 tu snout 25 mm. The? vertically oriented integrated reinforcement structure length {„ft: will vary bawesn about 70 to abou'; 95% of the vertical seat back height, and ( ior■? preferably ?;bout 80 to about 90%.<br>
it will be -appreciated tiat the above design criteria are preferred but are not in.e,!ided as limitinc. Depending upon the particular applications, variations to the i:3(.■'$ rneiv be mnda. Moreover, it should be appreciated that forming an Integrated i ,;r arcerrent ij;njc;ure need not occur In every application, and the need for and i isc nitude of sun jieneraily will be directly proportional relationship to the size of the J;.-*!; back. Thu^ tor exampie, a smaller folding seat may not require a perimeter ii..te:.|:ra;e«f reinfaroornent structure or it may only require it in limited areas.<br>
Refarrinc by way of illustration to FIGS. 1 and 4A-7D (and 24)(without limilotion as.to "ha other configurations, such as ones excluding a vertically oriented {.■&gt;{ x.eter integrated reinforcement structure), for folding seat backs, ths hinge ;: ,:.;;

In or.a enbodirnent, the bracket portion is an elongate member, having a ;;:n r:h of tfbou*; 30 -o about £00 mm, and a width of about 10 to about 75 mm, (See, k;. 5) The v.o I or wells can be disposed anywhere alcng 'ihe length of the hinge i3!:smbiy (e.g.. ;.it rjne or both of its ends, cr at an intermediate location), The walls uv ' be CDnfigjr -KJ in any suitable manner, with FIGS. 5 and 6 illustrating two such :Q\ f.guralions. In ,:::iG. 5, the walls include a first side wall portion 126 and a second ■:p;:osing side wail portion 128, both of which are about the same length, and have ■n ntermeclatfc will portion 130 bridging them.   In FIG. 5t a first side wall portion<br><br>
1.52 and a seconc. side wall portion 134 are joined with an intermediate portion 136. Tie first «nd sec.and side portions are arranged so that a distal end 138 of the s icond side wail portion 134 extends beyond a distal end 140 of the first side portion 132;. The internaciate side portion 13(3 is such that il optionally includes a section raninatinci at an ec;ge 142 that extends beyond the distai end 140 of the first side p:iri5:n IS;! toward the distal end 133 of the second side portion 134.

Illustrative alternative configurations are disclosed in FIGS. 11A-F. h each :i;i=.nce the sri'ier 154 includes at least one mounting portion 156 for attaching to hti: seat back 12 (either adhesively, with suitable fasteners, insert molded or .:-ti\ srwisei anc r. projecting striker bar 158 (which projects through an apereture or ,!tr in the seal back 12). The mounting portion 156 includes one or more? Ganges '6! for overiapphg with zrd engaging the seat back 12 or an integrated -si'.forcernent i.ructure 20 associated with it (e.g. FIG; 1 1 F). The overlap preferably an .33s from aLoui" 3 mm (and more preferably about 10 mm to about 150 mm). As ;h;:wn in ~IG.

As iiIustni.O(J in FIGS. 113 and 11E, without limitation, shoulder bolts 164 or i;tf ir like struuiur&amp;s may optionally be employed as desired for securing the i ot: ntion mechanism 28 to the seat back 12,<br>
it may br= desirable to further reduce the potential fcr the retention mechanism :■::&gt; - reate a ninrje point, by locally reinforcing the seat bac-'c in or adjacent the region ■.a ,/nich the ialdi member is secured. This can be done in any suitable manner, for ■ns: arics, by th^ in'corporation of one or more integrated reinforcement structures in :Ui; regicn or by Incorporation of an additional or supplemental metal, plastic or ;0; :posit«! reinxreemsnt member within the seat back, about the entirety o: at least ] i::rticn of the ptsrimater of the seat back. For instance, FIG. 12 illustrates an L-;.i;;p0d sjpplerri'S.'ital CGrnQt reinforcement 165, which is a relatively rigid member oci;ed between i the opposing wafis of the seat back. The supplemental ei fcrcenen.t '.?o can also te reoriented orthogonally about the z-axis relative to the 0:i;icn shown in FIG. 12. Of course, in such regions, integrated reinforcement ;:r .:(;tures may be smployed as desired to achieve such reinforcement. Typically, if ru; striker oar -113 is iocatac below about 20% of the height of the seat back, ru-asurec from the top of the seat back, then the supplemental reinforcement rui:nber is incorporated and positioned generally in the anticipated load path ;-e; *een n seat bet: mounting point (if any) and the striker bar 118.<br>
It wiii bo appreciated that the use of a supplements reinforcement member is :c: limited to he vicinity of tie iatch. One or more supplemental reinforcement nc: iibers may ho i.-sod elsewhere in tiie seat back. For instance, a hybrid seat back -.sv-iiig a rigid ■■■L'pplementei reinforcement member may be placed between or .AJI side of the seat back wails generally about the perimeter of the seat back.<br>

Fixed seats may include no i re * assemb-y ncr r.ny assembly. The seating system ma&gt; include one or more rear S^EJS that fold downward to a larger sto-'age area, and which may require the seat t: ;.c:i to act es k;&amp;£ rlocr. The? seat may be a split design (e.g., about 50/50, 30/40, 7I)/::J or the iil ;.:••;, or the seats may constitute a one piece design, h one tirnl'odiment, th&gt;;* -saat back is latched to either a structural package shelf (top Lstci es) or to the :):&gt;dy in white (side outboard latches), and seat belt anchors or seat l:*i! guidance system [as may be needed for a center mounted belt) for the two t uhoard seats m rat attached on the soat. (See FIG. 1).<br>
A sliding bck pin might be incorporated between two folding seats. The sliding \:\r\ -;an be- unloc:l-.e».i to fold down one portion of the seat and seif locking v/hen the i::;;c: back;; are .:o;;h upright.
