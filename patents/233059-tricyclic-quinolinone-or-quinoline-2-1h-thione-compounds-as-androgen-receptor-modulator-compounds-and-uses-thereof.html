				<td>The present invention relates to tricyclic quinolinone or quinoline-2(lH)-thione compounds as androgen receptor modulator compounds and uses thereof.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Intracellular receptors (IRs) form a class of structurally-related genetic regulators scientists have named "ligand dependent transcription factors." R.M. Evans, Science, 240:889 (1988). Steroid receptors are a recognized subset of the IRs, including the progesterone receptor (PR) androgen receptor (AR), estrogen receptor (ER), glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and mineralocorticoid receptor (MR). Regulation of a gene by such factors requires both the IR itself and a corresponding ligand, which has the ability to selectively bind to the IR in a way that affects gene transcription.<br>
A compound that binds an IR and mimics the effect of the native ligand is referred to as an "agonist", while a compound that inhibits the effect of the native ligand is called an "antagonist." The term "modulators" refers to compounds that are agonists, partial agonists or antagonists.<br>
The effectiveness of known modulators of steroid receptors is often tempered by their undesired side-effect profile, particularly during long-term administration. For example, the effectiveness of progesterone and estrogen agonists, such as norgestrel and diethylstlbesterol, respectively, as female birth control agents must be weighed against the increased risk of breast cancer and heart disease to women taking such agents. Similarly, the progesterone antagonist, mifepristone (RU486), if administered for chronic indications, such as uterine fibroids, endometriosis and certain hormone-dependent<br><br><br>
cancers, could lead TO homeostatic imbalances in a patient due to its inherent crossreactivity<br>
as a GR antagonist. Accordingly, identification of compounds that have good<br>
specificity for one or more steroid receptors, but have reduced or no cross-reactivity for<br>
other steroid or mtracellular receptors, would be of significant value in the treatment of<br>
male and female hormone responsive diseases.<br>
A group of quinolmone and coumarin analogs having a fused ring system of the<br>
aryl, piperidme. pyrrolidine, or indoline series have been described as androgen<br>
modulators. See U. S. Patent No. 5,696,130; Int. Patent Appl. WO 97/49709; L.G.<br>

The compounds of the present invention can be synthesized as pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salts for incorporation into various pharmaceutical compositions. As used<br>
herein, phannaceutically acceptable salts include, but are not limited to. hydrochloric,<br>
hydrobromic, hydroiodic, hydrofluoric, sulfuric, citric, maleic, acetic, lactic, mcotmic,<br>
succmic, oxalic, phosphoric, malonic, salicylic, phenylacetic, stearic, pyndine,<br>

calcium, magnesium, zinc, lithium, cmnamic, methylammo, methanesulfonic, picric,<br>
tartaric. tnethylaniino, dimethyl ammo, tris(hydroxymethyl)ammomethane and the like and<br>
suitable combinations of any two or more thereof. Additional phannaceutically acceptable<br>
salts are known to those skilled in the art..<br>
AR agonist, partial agonist and antagonist compounds (including compounds with<br>
tissue-selective AR modulator activity) of the present invention may be useful in the<br>
treatment of process(es) mediated by androgen receptor(s), including acne (antagonist),<br>
male-pattern baldness (antagonist), male hormone replacement therapy (agonist), sexual<br>
dysfunction t agonist), wasting diseases (agonist), hirsutism (antagonist), stimulation of<br>
hematopoiests (agonist), hypogonadism (agonist), prostatic hyperplasia (antagonist),<br>
osteoporosis (agonist), male contraception (agonist), impotence (agonist), cancer cachexia<br>
(agonist), various hormone-dependent cancers (e.g., prostate cancer (antagonist), breast<br>
cancer and the like), process(es) requiring anabolic agents (agonist) and the like. It is<br>
understood by those of skill in the art that a partial agonist may be used where agonist<br>
activity is desired, or where antagonist activity is desired, depending upon the AR<br>
modulator profile of the particular partial agonist.<br>
h is understood by those skilled in the art that while the compounds of the present<br>
invention will typically be employed as selective agonists, partial agonists or antagonists,<br>
that there may be instances where a compound with a mixed steroid receptor profile is<br>
desirable. For example, use of a PR agonist (z.e.,..progestin) in female contraception often<br>
leads to the undesired effects of increased water retention and acne flare-ups, hi this<br>
instance, a compound that is primarily a PR agonist, but also displays some AR and MR<br>
modulating activity, may prove useful. Specifically, the mixed MR effects would be<br>
useful to control water balance in the body, while the AR effects would help to control any<br>
acne flare-ups that occur.<br>
Furthermore, it is understood by those skilled in the art that the compounds of the<br>
present invention, including pharmaceutical compositions and formulations containing<br>
these compounds, can be used in a wide variety of combination therapies to treat the<br>
conditions and diseases described above. Thus, the compounds of the present invention<br>
can be used in combination with other hormones and other therapies, including, without<br>
limitation, chemotherapeutic agents such as cytostatic and cytotoxic agents,<br>
immunological modifiers such as interferons, interleukins, growth hormones and other<br>
cytokmes, hormone therapies, surgery and radiation therapy.<br>

Compounds of the present invention, comprising classes of heterocyclic nitrogen<br>
compounds and their derivatives, can be obtained by routine chemical synthesis, e.g., by<br>
modification of the heterocyclic nitrogen compounds disclosed or by a total synthesis<br>
approach.<br>
The sequences of steps for several general schemes to synthesize the compounds of<br>
1 ^ the present invention are shown below. In each of the schemes the R groups (e.g., R , R",<br>
etc.) correspond to the specific substitution patterns noted in the Examples. However, it<br>
will be understood by those skilled in the art that other functionalities disclosed herein at<br>
the indicated positions of compounds of formulas I thorough IV also comprise potential<br>

Scheme I<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
A synthesis of an 87^-[l,4]oxazino[2,3-/]quinolin-8-one compound (e.g., structures<br>
9 and 11.), is depicted in Schemes I and II. The process of Scheme I begins with the<br>
Rnorr cyclization of a phenylenediamine denvative. for example, 5-chloro-l,3-<br>
phenylenediaraine (structure 1), with a p-ketoester. or its corresponding hydrate or<br>
hemiacetal, for example ethyl 4,4,4-triiluoroacetoacetate, to afford the corresponding<br>
(l//)-quinolin-2-one. See G, Jones, Comprehensive Heterocyclic Chemisny, Katritzky, A.<br>
R.; Rees, C. W., eds. Pergamon, New York, 1984. Vol. 2, chap. 2.08, pp 421-426, the<br>
disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference. Reduction of the halide group<br>
could be achieved by chemical reduction, with, for example, a metal catalyst for example,<br>
10% Pd-C. in a hydrogen atmosphere, to afford a compound of structure 2. Conversion of<br>
the aniline to a phenol could be effected by treatment of structure 2 with a diazotizmg<br>
agent, for example, sodium nitrite in sulfuric acid, to afford a compound of structure 3.<br>
Bromination of the phenol with a bromxnatmg reagent, for example. /V-brornosuccinimide,<br>
in the presence of a base, for example, diisopropylamine, affords a compound of structure<br>
4. See S, Fujisaki, et. ai, Bull. Chem. Soc. Jpn. 1993, 66, 1576-1579, the disclosure of<br>
which is herein incorporated by reference.<br>
Selective protection of the phenolic oxygen could be achieved by treatment of<br>
structure 4 with an allcyl halide, for example, benzyl bromide, in the presence of a base,<br>
for example, :.esmm fluoride, to afford the corresponding ether. Protection of the<br>
pyndonc ring, with, for example isopropyl iodide, mediated by a base, for example,<br>
cesium fluoride, affords the corresponding imino ether (structure 5). Selective hydrolysis<br>
of the phenolic ether could be accomplished by acidic hydrolysis, with, for example, a 1:1<br>
mixture of metbnnesulfonic acid and acetic acid, to afford a phenol of structure 6.<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
T'he io] lowing transformations are illustrated in Scheme II. Alkylation of the<br>
phenolic oxygen was accomplished by treatment of the phenol with a protected amino<br>
alcohol, tor example, (J/?)-A-/-boc-almol, under Mitsunobu conditions, for example,<br>
tnphenylphosphine and diisopropyl azodicarboxylate, in the presence of a base, for<br>
example, ;V-methylrnorpholine, to afford the con-esponding Mitsunobu product. Removal<br>
of the r-butoxycarbonyl protecting group can be accomplished by acidic hydrolysis, with,<br>
for example, triiluoroacetic acid, to afford a compound of structure 7 (Scheme II).<br>
Closure of the amine to the aromatic halide can be achieved by treatment of compound<br>
with a transition metal for example Pd2(dba)3 in the presence of a ligand, for example,<br>
BINAP, and a base, for example, sodium /-butoxide, to afford a compound of structure 8.<br>
See S. Wagaw, et. al, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997, 119, 8451-8458, the disclosure of which is<br>
herein incorporated by reference. Treatment of a compound of structure 8 with an acid, for<br>
example hydrochloric acid in acetic acid, at elevated temperatures, affords an &amp;H-<br>
[ 1.4Jox.azino| 2,3-/]quinolin-8-one of structure 9. Alternatively, treatment of a compound<br>
of structure 8 with an aldehyde or its corresponding hydrate or hemiacetal, for example,<br>
tniluoroacetaldehyde hemiacetal, m the presence of a reducing agent, for example, sodium<br>
cvanoborohydnde, in a carboxyhc acid, for example, trifluoroacetic acid, affords a<br>
compound of structure 10. Alternatively, alkylation could be achieve by alkylation of<br>
structure 8 with an alkyl halide, for example, allyl bromide, mediated by a base, for<br>
example potassium carbonate, to afford a compound of structure 10. Treatment of a<br>
compound of structure 10 with an acid, for example hydrochloric acid in acetic acid,<br>
affords an o/i'-[l ,4]oxazmo|2,3-/Jqumolin-8-one, a compound of structure 11.<br>
Alternatively, treatment of a compound of structure 9 with an aldehyde or its<br>
corresponding hydrate or hemiacetal, for example, cyclopropylmethylcarboxaldehyde, in<br>
the presence, of a reducing agent, for example, sodium cyanoborohydnde, in a carboxylic<br>
acid, for example, acetic acid, affords a compound of structure 11.<br>
An enaniiorner of structures 9 or 11, or a racemic mixture may be obtained by the<br>
synthetic route as described in Scheme II, by starting with the enantiomer of the /?-<br>
aminoalcohoi as shown (e.g., an (iT)-/?-ammo alcohol), or a racemic mixture of the ftammoalcohoi<br>
shown (e.g., a (+)-/?-amino alcohol. Accordingly, an (
employed in Scheme II, produces an (iSVquinolinone; an (J?)-/?-amino alcohol, employed<br>
m Scheme I I . produces an (/f)-quinolinone; and a racemic mixture of the /?-amino alcohol,<br>
employed in Scheme II, produces a racemic mixture of the corresponding quinolinone. A<br>
racemic mixture of quinolinones could be separated into its corresponding enantiomers by<br>
separation on chiral HPLC with, for example, a chirapak AS column eluted with<br>
hex.anes:ethanol.<br>
Scheme [II<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
The asymmetric synthesis in Scheme III begins with the chemo- and<br>
regioselective A'-alkylation of a |3-ammoalcohoi, either as a single enantiomer (R or tS) or<br>
its racernate. for example. (Sj-prolinol, onto a 3,4-dihalonitrobenzene, for example, 3,4-<br>
difiuoromtrolienzene, mediated by abase, for example, sodium bicarbonate, to afford an<br>
optically pure arylamino alcohol (e.g., structure 14). Benzoxazine compounds (e.g.,<br>
structure 15'). may then be formed by cyclization of the A'- alky 1 substituted ammo alcohol<br>
compounds (.;.;., structure 14) by treatment with a base such as sodium hydride.<br>
Reduction o t ' n i t r o benzoxazme compounds (e.g., structure 15) with a reducing agent, for<br>
example, zinc, and calcium chloride affords an amino benzoxazme compound (e.g..<br>
structure 16) Treatment of an ammo benzoxazme with a j3-ketoester or its corresponding<br>
hydrate, tor example ethyl 4,4,4-trifluoroacetoacetate, at elevated temperatures, affords the<br>
corresponding acetanilide. Treatment of the acetanilide with an acid, for example, sulfuric<br>
acid, affords an optically pure quinolinone compound (e.g., structures 17 and 18). An<br>
enantiomer of structure 17, or a racemic mixture maybe obtained by the synthetic route as<br>
described in Scheme III, by starting with the enantiomer of the /?-aminoalcohol as shown<br>
(e.g., an uS&gt;/&gt;-amino alcohol), or a racemic mixture of the /?-aminoalcohol shown (e.g., a<br>
(±)-/Aamino alcohol. Accordingly, an (S)-/3-amino alcohol, employed in Scheme III,<br>
produces an i6T)-quinolinone; an (/?)-/?- amino alcohol, employed in Scheme III, produces<br>
an (A')-quirioiinone; and a racernic mixture of the /?-amino alcohol, employed in Scheme<br>
III, produces a racemic mixture of the corresponding quinolinone.<br>
Scheme IV<br>
A synthesis of an 8Ar-[l,4]oxazino[2,3-f)quinoline (e.g., structures 19 and 20), is<br>
depicted in Scheme IV. The process of Scheme IV begins by treatment of a quinolinone<br>
with a lialogenating agent, for example, phosphorus oxychloride, to afford a compound of<br>
structure 19. Substitution of the halide can be accomplished by treatment with a<br>
nucleophile, for example, sodium methoxide in methanol, to afford a compound of<br>
structure 20.<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
The asymmetric synthesis of Scheme V begins with the chemo- and regioselective<br>
A'-alkylation of a p-ammoalcohol, either as a single enantiomer (R or S) or its racemate,<br>
For example, (JR}-2-ammo-] -butanol, onto a 3,4-dihalonitrobenzene, for example, 3,4-<br>
difluoromtroherizene, to afford an optically pure arylamino alcohol (e.g., Structure 21).<br>
Treatment of ammo alcohol compounds such as Structure 21 with an aldehyde or the<br>
corresponding hydrate or hemiacetal, for example, tnfluoroacetaldehyde ethyl hemiacetal,<br>
in the presence of an acid catalyst, for example p-toluenesulfonic acid, affords an optically<br>
purs oxazoluiine compound (e.g., structure 22). Treatment of an oxazolidine compound<br>
such as structure 22 with a reducing agent, for example, triethylsllane, in the presence of<br>
an acid, for example, titanium tetrachlonde, affords an TV-alky! substituted ammo alcohol<br>
compound (e.g., structure 23). Benzoxazine compounds (e.g., structure 24), may then be<br>
formed by cyclization of the jY-alkyl substituted amino alcohol compounds (e.g., structure<br>
23) by treatment with a base such as sodium hydride. Reduction of nitro benzoxazine<br>
compounds (e.g.. structure 24) with a reducing agent, for example, palladium on carbon<br>
under a hydrogen atmosphere, affords an aminobenzoxazine compound (e.g., structure<br>
25). Treatment of a compound of structure 25 with an acylatmg agent, for example<br>
trimethylacetyl chloride, in the presence of a base, for example, pyndine, affords a<br>
compound of structure 26. Rb may be, in addition to /-butyl, an aryl or a stencally<br>
hindered alkyl substituent. Alternatively, it may be t-butoxy, aryloxy, or a stencally<br>
hindered alkoxy substituent. Regioselective lithiation of a compound of structure 26 with<br>
a strong base, for example, r-butyllithium followed by quenching with an acylatmg agent,<br>
for example, ethyl trifluoroacetate, affords a compound of structure 27. The base may be<br>
an alternative organolithium reagent, for example, sec-butyllithium or ?7-butyllithiurn.<br>
Treatment of a compound of structure 27 with a Horner-Emmons reagent, for example,<br>
(carbethoxvrnethylene)tnphenylphosphorane produces a compound of structure 28.<br>
Annulaiion of a compound of structure 28 to the pyridone ring may be accomplished by<br>
treatment of a compound of structure 28 with an acid, for example hydrochloric acid in<br>
acetic acid to afford a compound of structure 29.<br>
An enantiomer of structure 29, or a racemic mixture, may be obtained by the<br>
synthetic rouie as described in Scheme V, by starting with the enantiomer of the (3-<br>
aminoalcohoi as shown (e.g., an ()S)-j3-amino alcohol), or aracemic mixture of the (3-<br>
ammoaicoho! shown (e.g., a (-r-)-p-amino alcohol. Accordingly, an (iS}-(3-amino alcohol,<br>
employed in Scheme V, produces an (iSVquinolinone; an (jR)-(3-ammo alcohol, employed<br>
in Scheme V, produces an (-R)-quinolinone; and aracemic mixture of the P-amino alcohol,<br>
employed m Scheme V, produces a racemic mixture of the corresponding quinolinone.<br>
Scheme VI<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
An alternative racemic route to nitrobenzoxazine compounds.of structure 24<br>
(Scheme VI) begins with the //-alleviation of a 2-amino-5-nitrophenol nitrogen by<br>
treatment with an aldehyde, its corresponding hydrate or hemiacetal, with for example,<br>
tnfluoroacetaJdehyde hydrate in the presence of a reducing agent, for example, sodium<br>
cyanoborohydride, in an acid, for example trifluoroacetic acid. This procedure affords an<br>
A-'-alkyiated compound of structure 30. This can be further transformed by alkylation with<br>
a haloketone, for example, 2-bromobutanone, mediated by a base, for example, potassium<br>
carbonate, followed by treatment with a reducing agent, for example, sodium<br>
cyanoborohydride, in an acid, for example acetic acid, to afford a benzoxazme compound<br>
ii-'.e.. structure 24).<br>
Scheme V I I<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
Scheme V'll descnbes a route to compounds of structure 34. A compound of<br>
structure- 5 is created with an amine, amide, or carbamate, for example butylamme, and a<br>
transition rneial. for example Pd?_(dba)3, in the presence of a ligand, for example BINAP,<br>
and a base, for example, cesium carbonate, to afford a compound of structure 31.<br>
Removal of the benzyl group with a reducing agent, for example palladium on carbon<br>
under a hydrogen atmosphere, affords a compound of structure 32. A compound of<br>
structure 32 is treated with an alpha-halo ester, for example, ethyl bromoacetate. in the<br>
presence of a base, for example potassium carbonate, to afford a compound of structure<br>
33. A compound of structure 33 is hydrolyzed with an acid, for example, concentrated<br>
Hen in acetic acid, to afford a compound of structure 34.<br>
The compounds of the present invention also include racemates, stereo isomers and<br>
mixtures of said compounds, including isotopically-labeled and radio-labeled compounds.<br>
Sucii isomers can be isolated by standard resolution techniques, including fractional<br>
crystallization and chiral column chrornatography.<br>
As noted above, the steroid modulator compounds of the present invention can be<br>
combined in a mixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier to provide<br>
pharmaceutical compositions useful for treating the biological conditions or disorders<br>
noted herein in mammalian and, more particularly, in human patients. The particular<br>
earner employed in these pharmaceutical compositions may take a wide variety of forms<br>
depending upon the type of administration desired. Suitable administration routes include<br>
enteral (e.g., oral), topical, suppository and parenteral (e.g., intravenous, intramuscular and<br>
subcutaneous).<br>
In preparing the compositions in oral liquid dosage forms (e.g., suspensions, elixirs<br>
and solutions), typical pharmaceutical media, such as water, glycols, oils, alcohols,<br>
flavoring agents, preservatives, coloring agents and the like can be employed. Similarly,<br>
when preparing oral solid dosage forms (e.g., powders, tablets and capsules), carriers such<br>
as starches, sugars, diluents, granulating agents, lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents<br>
and the like may be employed. Due to their ease of administration, tablets and capsules<br>
represent a desirable oral dosage form for the pharmaceutical compositions of the present<br>
invention.<br>
For parenteral administration, the earner will typically include sterile water,<br>
although other ingredients that aid in solubility or serve as preservatives may also be<br>
included. Furthermore, injectable suspensions may also be prepared, in which case<br>
appropriate l i q u id earners, suspending agents and the like may be employed.<br>
For it ,-pical administration, the compounds of the present invention may be<br>
formulated using bland, moisturizing bases, such as ointments or creams. Examples of<br>
suitable ointment bases are petrolatum, petrolatum plus volatile silicones. lanolin and<br>
water in oil emulsions such as Eucerin™, available from Beiersdorf (Cincinnati, Ohio).<br>
Examples of suitable cream bases are Nivea™, available from Beiersdorf (Cincinnati,<br>
Ohio), eoid cream (USP), Purpose Cream™, available from Johnson &amp; Johnson (New<br>
Brunswick, New Jersey), hydrophilic ointment (USP) and Lubiiderm™, available from<br>
vVamer-Lanibert (Morris Plains, New Jersey).<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions and compounds of the present invention will<br>
general!)- be administered in the form of a dosage unit (e.g., tablet, capsule, etc.). The<br>
compounds of the present invention generally are administered in a daily dosage of from<br>
about 1 ug/k;.; of body weight to about 500 mg/kg of body weight. Typically, the<br>
compounds of the present invention are administered in a daily dosage of from about 10<br>
ug'kp; to about 250 mg/kg of body weight. Most often, the compounds of the present<br>
invention are administered in a daily dosage of from about 20 p-g/kg to about 100 mg/kg<br>
body weight. As recognized by those skilled in the art, the particular quantity of<br>
pharmaceutical composition according to the present invention administered to a patient<br>
will depend upon a number of factors, including, without limitation, the biological activitydesired,<br>
ihe condition of the patient and the patient's tolerance for the drug.<br>
The compounds of this invention also have utility when labeled (e.g., radiolabeled,<br>
isotopically-labeled and the like) as ligands for use in assays to determine the<br>
presence of A.R in a cell background or extract. They are particularly useful due to their<br>
ability to selectively activate androgen receptors and can therefore be used to determine<br>
the presence of such receptors in the presence of other steroid receptors or related<br>
mtracelluiar receptors. Thus, the invention provides methods of determining the presence<br>
of androgen receptors (AR) in a cell or cell extract.<br>
These invention methods comprise contacting the cell or cell extract with the<br>
compounds of the present invention which have been labeled and testing the contacted cell<br>
or cell extract to determine the presence of AR. Testing can be accomplished via testing<br>
for activation oi androgen receptor(s) (e.g., via elevated presence of the product of<br>
androgen mediated process(es)). via separation of the bound compound/receptor<br>
combinauon and the like, which techniques are known to those of skill in the art.<br>
Due to the selective specificity of the compounds of this invention for steroid<br>
receptors, these compounds can be used to purify samples of steroid receptors in vitro.<br>
Such purification can be earned out by mixing samples containing steroid receptors with<br>
one or more o i" the compounds of the present invention so that the compounds bind to the<br>
receptors of ciioice and then isolating the bound ligand/receptor combination by separation<br>
techniques which are known to those of skill in the art. These techniques include column<br>
separation, filtration, centnfugation, tagging and physical separation and antibody<br>
complexmg, among others. Thus, the invention also provides methods for purifying<br>
samples of steroid receptors in vitro. Invention methods comprise contacting a sample<br>
containing steroid receptors with one or more of the compounds of the present invention<br>
so that the compounds bind to the steroid receptors to form a bound compound/receptor<br>
combination and separating out the bound compound/receptor combination.<br>
The compounds and pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention can. be<br>
used in the treatment of the diseases and conditions described herein, hi this regard, the<br>
compounds and compositions of the present invention may prove particularly useful as<br>
modulators of male sex steroid-dependent diseases and conditions (e.g., process(es)<br>
mediated by androgen receptors) such as the treatment of acne, male-pattern baldness,<br>
sexual dysfunction, wasting diseases, hirsutism, hypogonadism, prostatic hyperplasia,<br>
osteoporosis, impotence, cancer cachexia and various hormone-dependent cancers,<br>
including prostate and breast cancer. The compounds of the present invention may also<br>
prove useful in male hormone replacement therapy, stimulation of hematopoiesis, male<br>
contraception and as anabolic agents.<br>
As utilized herein, the term "modulate" includes the ability of a modulator for a<br>
member of the androgen. receptor family to either directly (by binding to the receptor as a<br>
ligand) or indirectly (as a precursor for a ligand or an inducer which promotes production<br>
of ligand from a precursor) induce expression of gene(s) maintained under hormone<br>
expression control, or to repress expression of gene(s) maintained under such control.<br>
Thus, both inhibitory effects on androgen receptors and activating effects on androgen<br>
receptors are contemplated within the scope of modulation.<br>
The compounds of the present invention may be extremely potent activators of AR.<br>
displaying 50% maximal activation of AR (e.g., activation of AR, determined by<br>
measurement of luciferase production levels compared to levels achieved by<br>
diliydrotestosierone (DHT)) at a concentration of less than 100 nlVl (Cotransfection assay<br>
concentration), at a concentration of less than 50 nM, at a concentration of less than 20<br>
njvl, or even at a concentration of 10 nM or less. (See, for example, Biological Examples.)<br>
In addition, selected compounds of the present invention may be extremely potent<br>
antagonists of AR, displaying 50% maximal inhibition of AR (e.g., inhibition of AR,<br>
determined by measurement of luciferase production levels compared to levels achieved<br>
by dihydrotestosterone (DHT)') at a concentration of less than 100 nM (Cotransfection<br>
assay concentration), at a concentration of less than 50 nM, at a concentration of less than<br>
20 nM, or even at a concentration of 10 nM or less. (See, for example. Biological<br>
Examples.)<br>
Selective compounds of the present invention generally do not display undesired<br>
cross-reactivity with other steroid receptors, as is seen with the compound mifepristone<br>
(RU486; Roussei Uclaf). a known PR antagonist that displays an undesirable cross<br>
reactivity on GR and AR, thereby limiting its use in long-term, chronic administration.<br>
The invention will be further illustrated by reference to the following non-limiting<br>
Examples. . <br>

BIOLOGICAL EXAMPLES<br>
A. Steroid Receptor Activity<br>
Utilizing the "cis-trans" or "co-transfection" assay described by Evans et al.,<br>
^Science, .240:889-95 (May 13, 1988), the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference<br>
herein, the compounds of the present invention were tested and found to have strong,<br>
specific activity as agonists, partial agonists and antagonists of AR. This assay is<br>
described in further detail in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,981,784 and 5,071,773, the disclosures of<br>
which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The co-transfection assay provides a method for identifying functional agonists<br>
and partial agonists that mimic, or antagonists that inhibit, the effect of native hormones<br>
and quantifying their activity for responsive IR proteins. In this regard, the co-transfection<br>
assay mimics an in vivo system in-the laboratory. Importantly, activity in the cotransfection<br>
assay correlates very well with known in vivo activity, such that the cotransfection<br>
assay functions as a qualitative and quantitative predictor of a tested<br>
compounds :n \-ivo phamiacology. See, e.g., 1. Bergeret al. 41 J. SteroidBiochem.<br>
Molec. Biol, 7";3 (1992), the disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference.<br>
In the co-transfection assay, a cloned cDNA for an IR (e.g., human PR, AR or GR)<br>
under the control of a constitutive promoter (e.g., the SV 40 promoter) is introduced by<br>
transfection (a procedure to induce cells to take up foreign genes) into a background cell<br>
substantially devoid of endogenous IRs. This introduced gene directs the recipient cells to<br>
make the IR protein of interest. A second gene is also introduced (co-transfected) into the<br>
same cells in conjunction with the ER. gene. This second gene, comprising the cDNA for a<br>
reporter protein, such as firefly luciferase (LUC), controlled by an appropriate hormone<br>
responsive promoter containing a hormone response element (HRE). This reporter<br>
plasnud functions as a reporter for the transcription-modulating activity of the target IR.<br>
Thus, the reporter acts as a surrogate for the products (mRNA then protein) normally<br>
expressed by a gene under control of the target receptor and its native hormone.<br>
flic eo-iransfection assay can detect small molecule agonists or antagonists of<br>
target IR;;. txposing the transfected cells to an agonist ligand compound increases<br>
reporter acin iry in the transfected cells. This activity can be conveniently measured, e.g.,<br>
bv increasing luciferase production, which reflects compound-dependent, IR-mediated<br>
increases in reporter transcription. A partial agonist's activity can be detected in a manner<br>
similar to that of the full agonist, except that the maximum measured activity, e.g.,<br>
luciferase production, is less than that of an agonist standard. For example, for AR, a<br>
partial agonist can be detected by measuring increased luciferase production, but the<br>
maximum effect at high concentration is Jess than the maximum effect for<br>
dihydrotestosterone. To detect antagonists, the co-transfection assay is carried out in the<br>
presence of a constant concentration of an agonist to the target IR (e.g., progesterone for<br>
PR) known u 
antagonist wfll decrease the reporter signal (e.g., luciferase production). The cotransfection<br>
assay is therefore useful to detect both agonists and antagonists of specific<br>
IRs. Furthermore, it determines not only whether a compound interacts with a particular<br>
Ill, but whether this interaction mimics (agonizes) or blocks (antagonizes) the effects of<br>
the native regulatory molecules on target gene expression, as well as the specificity and<br>
strength of this interaction.<br>
The activity of selected steroid receptor modulator compounds of the present<br>
invention weie evaluated utilizing the co-transfection assay and in standard IR binding<br>
assays, according to the following illustrative Examples.<br>
B. Co-transfection assav<br>
CV'-l cells (African green monkey kidney fibroblasts) were cultured in the<br>
presence of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10%<br>
charcoal resin-stripped fetal bovine serum (CH-FBS) then transferred to 96-well microtiter<br>
pjates one dav prior to transfection.<br>
To determine AR agonist and antagonist activity of the compounds of the present<br>
invention, tht C V-1 cells were transiently transfected by calcium phosphate<br>
coprecipuation according to the procedure of Berger et al., 41 J. Steroid Biochem. Mol.<br>
Bio!., 73? ( 1 °2 i with the following plasmids: pRShAR (5 ng/well), MTV-LUC reporter<br>
(1 00 ng'well}. pRS-B--Gal (50 ng/well) and filler DNA (pGEM; 45 ng/well). The receptor<br>
plusmid, pRShA.R, contains the human AR under constitutive control- of the SV-40<br>
promoter, as more fully described in J.A. Simental et al., "Transciiptional activation and<br>
nuclear targeting signals of the human androgen receptor", 266 J. Biol. Cheni., 510 (1991).<br>
The reporter plasmid, MTV-LUC, contains the cDNA for firefly luciferase (LUC)<br>
under control of the mouse mammary tumor virus (MTV) long terminal repeat, a<br>
conditional promoter containing an androgen response element. See e.g., Berger et al.<br>
supra. In addition, pRS-B-Gal, coding for constitutive expression of E. coli Bgalactosidase<br>
(B-Gal), was included as an internal control for evaluation of transfection<br>
efficiency and compound toxicity.<br>
Six hours after transfection, media was removed and the cells were washed with<br>
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Media containing reference compounds (i.e.<br>

agonist and RU486 as a GR antagonist; and aldosterone (Sigma) as a MR agonist and<br>

(Sigma) as an MR antagonist; and/or the modulator compounds of the present<br>
invention in concentrations ranging from 10~^ to 10"^ M were added to the cells. Three<br>
to four replicates were used for each sample. Transfections and subsequent procedures<br>
were performed on a Biomek 1000 automated laboratory work station.<br>
After 40 hours, the cells were washed with PBS, lysed with a Triton X-100-based<br>
buffer and assayed for LUC and fi-Gal activities using a luminometer or<br>
spectrophotorneter, respectively. For each replicate, the normalized response (MR) was<br>
calculated as:<br>
LUC response/B-Gal rate<br>
where B-Gal rate = B-Gal/6-Gal incubation time.<br>
The mean and standard error of the mean (SEM) of the NR were calculated. Data<br>
were plotted as the response of the compound compared to the reference compounds over<br>
the range of the close-response curve. For agonist experiments, the effective concentration<br>
that produced 50% of the maximum response (ECso) was quantified. Agonist efficacy<br>
was a function (%) of LUC expression relative to the maximum LUC production by the<br>
reference agonist for PR, AR., ER, GR or MR. Antagonist activity was determined by<br>
testing the amount of LUC expression in the presence of a fixed amount of DHT as an AR<br>
agonist and progesterone as a PR agonist at the EC5Q concentration. The concentration of<br>
a test compound that inhibited 50% of LLJC expression induced by the reference agonist<br>
was quantified (ICfO). in addition, the efficacy of antagonists was determined as a<br>
function (%) of maximal inhibition.<br>
Table 1: Agonist, partial agonist, antagonist and binding activity of androgen receptor<br>
modulator compounds of present invention, and the reference agonist,<br>
compound, dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a known synthetic androgen,<br>
fluoxymesterone (Fluox) and reference antagonist compounds, 2-<br>
hydroxyflutaniide (Flut) and Casodex (Cas), on hAR in CV-1 cells. Efficacy<br>
(%) for AR agonist is detennmed by comparing activity (e.g., luciferase<br>
production) of putative agonist to that of dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Efficacy<br>
(°&gt;) for AR antagonist is determined by the percentage amount by which the<br>
luciferase production is reduced (maximum concentration of antagonist) from<br>
the luciferase production of the standard (DHT).<br>
