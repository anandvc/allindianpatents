ADVANTAGES OF PRESENTED INVENTION:<br>
•	This invention is capable of charging batteries free of cost round the clock. The device is very simple and demands very less ground space.<br>
•	The device can also make use of existing building structures, trees as a part of circuit \ connection without any safety concerns for building or inhabitants.<br>

DETAILFD  DESCRIPTION. -<br>
The device consists of three basic parts as shown in the schematic, figure 1, page 15 of 22. i.e. (a) The space conductor \ line (b) the grounding conductor\ line (c) electric energy storage<br>
In my experiments with rechargeable cells &amp; capacitors it was noticed mat connecting of one of the terminal of discharged cell to a adequately grounded conductor and the other to a insulated conductor running vertically up into the atmosphere for a few meters Is sufficient to partially recharge chemical cetts and capacitors when left connected over a period of time. The cetts thus charged can be discharged by connecting any electrical toad. This process can be repeated, as required by simple switching arrangement<br>
A number of basks conceptual experiments represented by scheme 1, 2,3&amp;4, figurel ,2,3,4, page 15 of 22, presented under the heading " CHARGING CONFIGURATIONS " and experimental evidence summarized under the heading 'EXPERIMENTAL OBSERVATIONS OF EARTH POTENTIAL UVLIZER (E.P.Uy, page 17 of 22, Allows me to  INFER that His possible to charge electro chemical rechargeable batteries and capacitors by any of the simple schemes shown in figurel, figure 2, figure 3, figure 4 AND Fundamentally conclude as follows:-<br>
*	The  emf  \  peak voltage obtainable is directly proportional to the Shortest Distance' h 'between any point in atmosphere and the Surface of our planet earth.<br>
*	Time required to attain the peak \ equilibrium voltage at the terminals of Storage device «s directly proportional to ground ohmic resistance And inversely proportional to elevation' h' being used at the Concerned location on earth and partly on overall scheme ohmic Resistance, which depends on specific design detail.<br><br>
•	A number of cells of batteries can be charged in parallel or series depending on Emf available at a particular location and discharged in series or Parallel depending on specific power requirements.<br>
•	Any two points in the space around our planet separated by a vertical distance "h "are at different electrical potential, these can be tapped.<br><br><br><br>
•   Any two points one on the surf ace of earth and other below the surface separated by a depth of "h" are also at different electrical potential all though the potential difference is relatively lesser compared to space above the surface earth. Approximately 30 times lesser.<br>
# Description Of Charging Experiments &amp; Schemes:-<br>
Scheme 1 as shown in figure 1 consist of three basic parts<br>
(a)	Atmospheric insulated conductor.<br>
(b)	Grounding conductor.<br>
(c)	Storage device/celis.<br>
Where charging of (c) occurs by connection of (a) &amp; (b).<br>
The atmospheric insulated conductor (a) is connected to one of the terminal of storage device(c). A grounding conductor (b) connected to the othe Aremaining terminal of storage device(c) itself. In case of electrochemical batteries the terminal to be grounded is important Photo 1, 2,3, (Photograph sheet 1/2), page 18 of 22, shows a metal hydride cell being charged, where a mufti meter has been introduced between ground and storage cell tor current measurement The grounding (b), red wire, is shown in photo 3 where a number of bolts can be seen, driven through granite-cement based tiles.( 3rd floor balcony)<br>
Scheme 2 as shown in figure 2 consist of storage device &amp; a grounding conductor (b) only, as also mentioned above, wherein the storage device is simply kept at a height above earth surface. See photo 4,5 &amp;6 (photograph sheet 2\2), page 19 of 22, where grounding has been accomplished by driving bolts into terrace concrete. (Fourth floor roof)<br>
Scheme 3 as shown in figure 3 consists of same bash parts as scheme 1 except that the ground conductor is dipped in an insulated plastic tank (d), kept on surface, containing salt solution.<br>
Scheme 4 (latest experimental finding) shows a storage capacitor (c) placed on ground with one of the terminal connected to the grounding conductor, which in this case is a steel casing pipe running to a depth "h" of<br>
a deep bore welt. As shown under "EPU - SCHEME 4 TEST<br>
photograph", page 19 of 21.<br>
A common feature tor all three schemes is that all of mem are dependent on elevation  height \ depth ( 'h') above the surface of earth or below. It has also been observed mat schemes 1 &amp;2 give higher gains in voltage than scheme 4, where the conductor is simply goes deep into soil without any atmospheric conductor line.<br><br><br>
Typical Results of above mentioned charging experiments are graphed under "EXPERIMENTAL OBSERVATIONS OF E.P. U ". Its worth mentioning that the ratio of voltage per unit height observed in scheme 1 &amp;2 is around 30 times higher than mean ratio of the same observed in case of scheme 4.<br>
# Physics Behind the Working (Two Alternatives):<br>
Concepts given in engineering or science text books such, as magnetic storm of sun and its interaction with earth's magnetic field etc. Does not clearly explain how electron can get accumulated in storage device.<br>
The telluric currents and its source don't manifest in a manner explained above either.<br>
The TIME rate change of HORIZONTAL\ tangential magnetic flux density on the surface of earth in peninsular INDIA is of the order of 60 nano tesla per 24 hours; peaking to about 15 nanotesla per hour occasionally therefore they can be deemed as constant with respect to time. At best these may attribute to 0.5 to 1 mill volts, not hundreds of it.<br>
Therefore,  I would like to mention that increase of magnetic field intensity around earth with respect to ELEVATION as we move towards the surface of earth from outer space indicates existence of TIME rate change of magnetic flux in the vertical direction. I.e. along the line connecting a point in space and centre of our spinning earth. This leads to ELECTROMOTIVE FORCE on conductors arranged in radial \ vertical sense with respect to earth &amp; ourselves, as observed.<br>
It is also evident from classical physics, which states that movement of any matter in circular sense\ about a centre with or without rate change of tangential velocity implies accelerations of any matter\flux (magnetic flux)\energy towards the centre with respect to time.<br>
Hence. EPU is a separate application by itseif &amp; basic knowledge obtained by trials conducted \ observations can lead to other innovative devices for direct current electric power generation in near future.<br><br><br>
# Alternative Explanation to the Phenomena Observed.<br>
Lets assume for a while that flux mentioned above Is that of ether &amp; oar universe made up of or contains "ether" ,The emf development can be attributed to two main factors: -<br>
a)	Ether pressure differences between altitudes &amp; Electron to<br>
electron Repulsion.<br>
b)	Ether wind velocity change with respect to position\ orientation<br>
of electron.<br>
Expkination of (a): -<br>
Consider the lines of magnetic field around the earth as analogous to streamlines of flow i.e. Ether flow. Thus there is an evidence of a macro ether vortex around earth and passing through it (see velocity profile in figure 5, page 16 of 22).<br>
Ether can be given properties of fluid &amp; further assume that all matter and energy to be a manifestations of ether. Bernoulli's equation of fluid flow may be applied to electron movement, (electron itself can be considered to be made up of ether vortices ). where electrons migrate from zones of high ether pressure to zones of low ether pressures. I.e. from zones of low ether velocity to higher.<br>
The surface of earth corresponds to zone where ether speeds are higher &amp; a point above earth corresponds to a zone with lower ether flow speeds with relatively higher ether pressure, treating earth itself as a macro vortex (see figure 5) in which a very large number of other vortices (matter) lie in a state of spin &amp; rotation.<br>
Explanation of (b): -<br>
Analogous to principle of "Magmas"applied to rotating spheres\cylinders in flowing liquid. (The Reader may refer to any standard text on hydrodynamics for more on "Magnus principle "). See electron-spinning diagram (Figure 5).<br>
An electron made of ether vortex immersed in flowing ether wind can experience uneven forces in multiple directions, which vary with respect to time &amp; orientations of electron, however some of the orientations can develop forces in a direction, which adds to factor (a) explained above.<br>

APPENDIX<br>
MATTER &amp; ENERGY - A Computational Fluid Dynamics based interpretation. 1.A* INTRODUCTION:<br>
For a while lets assume mat the universe to start with, has only ether fluid in stationary condition with nothing else in it i.e. no known forms of matter as we recognize today.<br>
The only possible states of existence available at this point is 1) presence of ether &amp; 2) absence of it (ether) at a point in space. Let the absence of ether be called as void.<br>
A void or voids may have come into existence due many reasons initially, our objective here is to find if such a void is sustainable or not and under what conditions,<br>
2.A, ETHER PROPERTY ASSUMPTIONS &amp; JUSTIFICATIONS: -<br>
a)	In viscid fluid, Friction free flow: our galaxy has not stopped spinning &amp;<br>
Rotating for Billions of years. Therefore Ether moving it is non- Viscous or nearly so.<br>
b)	Incompressible fluid: it s a general tendency of many liquids to have<br>
higher<br>
Bulk Modulus with decreasing viscosity.<br>
c)	Acoustic speed equals speed of light: acoustical waves in ether are taken<br>
as Electromagnetic radiations of all types we know, as capable of<br>
traveling in space.<br>
d)	Relation ship between normal universal ether pressure *p 'and<br>
acoustic speed 'a'<br>
Since density of ether is unknown quantity in terms of SI units at this stage. Let us assume that we have 1kg of ether in 1 m3 of volume for the sake of simplifying density dependencies, which occur in equations of flow. The issue will be clear when we come to the section of 'governing equations', as we read on further. The intention here is to get only a relative understanding of structure of electron and ether vortices. An accurate definition of force in terms ether can follow as a next step.<br>
For Now, Acoustic speed in m/s becomes   a  = V (pip), where p = 1 kg mass/m3 is density of ether. Thus the normal universal space \ ether pressure becomes<br><br><br>
= 9 e 16 (m/s)2 * 1 (space mass/m3) = 9el6N/m2. = 9ell bars<br>
e) The ether flow is not continuous everywhere in domain of interest:<br>
Remember we are dealing with void ~ ether interaction. A region without pressure and velocities characterizes a void.<br>
3.A, ANAYLSIS TECHNIQUE &amp; MODEL: -<br>
Consider void immersed in ether. The ether volume is a cubical shaped &amp; void is well enclosed inside as shown below by isometric view: -<br>
Initial &amp; boundary conditions: -<br>
At time t = 0.0 Second ether particles are stationary i.e. u = v= w = 0 m/s, p = 9el6 N/m2 Everywhere in ether volume around the central void.(figure 5 &amp; 6, sheet 2 of 3).<br>
4.A, GOVERNING EQUATIONS FOR  ETHER: -<br><br>
The analysis involves simultaneous solution of above set of unsteady equations<br>
Based on gauss siedal technique. This can be done using a Pentium II class of computer in around 800 to 900 hours of computation, lasting approximately two months for ~ 27000 Nodes.<br>
Sketches can best show the inputs anD final results of above analysis: -Note: The phenomenon of pressure is somewhat analogous to pressure behavior around cavitation bubbles in water. As indicated by figure 6 &amp; 7, page 21of 22<br><br>
Hie pressure profiles (figure 8 &amp; 9, page 21 of 22) are applicable along lines passing through center of cube, parallel to x, y, z-axes. Thus we have a combination of at least 10 major tightly packed ether vortices around the central void, which is at equilibrium with each other after 0.7 seconds of initiation.<br>
5.A, DISCUSSION &amp; INFERENCES: -<br>
Initial conditions of velocities play a major role in what we get as final results i.e. whether we get pure vortex or void + vortex or a particular type of vortex combination. Each kind of vortex or void vortex combination may explain, a particular form of sub atomic particle matter.<br>
Example 1 A tight toroidal ether vortex with low pressure in center can<br>
represent an electron.   Most behaviors of electron known to us may be<br>
explained by this consideration.<br>
Example!. Void vortex combine such as the results of this computation (shown below) may represent a neuron in nucleus of atoms. While some combination of void - vortex with spin may represent die nucleus of an atom.<br>
a)	Voids are sustainable in etberAspace. Voids + its velocity, pressure field can be called as electron.<br>
b)	Matter is combination of void and associated vortices, which can be of any size.<br>
c)	Void ~ vortex combination migrates from zones of higher ether pressure to lower ether pressure zones. Conversely from region of lower ether speed to zone of higher ether speed.<br>
d)	Earth spinning about its axis can be attributed to ether flow vortex,<br>
e)	Electromagnetic radiations are due to transient fluctuation of void size or ether fluid pressure fluctuations around a void - vortex.<br>
f)	Amount of ether present among conglomeration of matter is relatively lesser than that of free space. Thus in a zone of a macro ether vortex (without void), so-called matter (formed out of very large number of void ~ vortex combination) will have lesser ether in it i.e. will present a conglomerate of lower ether density. Such a conglomerate will settle in the center of macro ether vortex in space. Example - Our planet<br>
6.A, FURTHER SCOPE OF STUDY: -<br>
From analysis of above type we know that initial voids of size d2 reduces to approximately 0.7 d2 after equilibrium conditions are established (see figure 7, sheet 2 of 3). With this information we can work to find out amount of ether undergoing<br><br><br>
acceleration of lm/s2, as regards to the standard Kilogramme mass. This shall involve size of standard mass, its material, number of electrons, nucleuses their sizes.<br>
Since 1 N =  1 Kg. lm/s2, ether undergoing acceleration of 1 m/s2 are only those which are asso ciated in the formation of electrons, nucleus of atoms present in the standard kilogramme mass. The remaining ether i.e. in between electrons and nucleus remain relatively undisturbed as long as no magnetic field is involved. A factor account for the amount\additional volume of ether needs to be developed by use of CFD.<br>
Thus volume of ether undergoing lm/s2 accn., experiencing 1 N Force becomes known corresponding to the volume of standard kilogram. THIS volume &amp; ether may be called as standard ether mass. There can be several ether masses contained in a meter cube of ether. The total numerical magnitude of all such masses "x" can treated as true amount of ether contained in 1 m3 therefore x kg/m3 is the density of ether in terms of S J. units as we know it &amp; is sensible to humans.<br>
Thus more numerically accurate results can be obtained by repeating section 2,3 &amp; 4 mentioned above.<br>
The possibility of other types of vortex flow formations needs to be explored.<br>
7.A, CONCLUSION:-<br>
VOIDS, VORTICES ARE SUSTAINABLE IN ETHER MEDIUM AND MATTER CAN BE TREATED AS VOID ~ VORTEX COMBINATION AND ELECTRONS MAY BE MADE UP OF ETHER VORTEX IN RELATIVELY STAGNANT ETHER.<br>
STATIONARY ETHER WITH ASSOCIATED PRESSURE IS FORM OF POTENTIAL ENERGY.<br>
THE PRESENTED THEORY IS JUST ENOUGH TO EXPLAIN THE PHYSICS OF PRESENTED INVENTION 'EARTH POTENTIAL UTILIZER<br>
