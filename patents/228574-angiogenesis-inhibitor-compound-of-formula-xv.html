Backgrottnd of the Invention<br>
Angiogensis the fundamental process by which new blood vessels are formed and is essential to a variety of normal body activities (such as reproduction, development and wound repair). Although the process is not completely understood, it is believed to involve a complex interplay of molecules which both stimulate and inhibit the growth of endothelial cells, the primary cells of the capillary blood vessels. Under normal conditions, these molecules appear to maintain the microvasculature in a quiescent state (i.e., one of no capillary growth) for prolonged periods which may last for as long as weeks or in some cases, decades. When necessary, however, (such as during wound repair), these same cells can undergo rapid proliferation and tumover within a 5 day period (Folkman, J. and Shing, Y., Journal of Biological Chemistry, 267(16): 10931-10934, and Folkman, J. and Klagsbrun, M, (1987) Science, 235:442-447).<br>
Although angiogenesis is a highly regulated process under normal conditions, many diseases (charactrazed as "angiogenic diseases") are driven by persistent unregulated angiogenesis. Otherwise stated, unregulated angiogenesis may either cause a particular disease directly or exacerbate an existing pathological condition. For example, ocular neovacularization has been implicated as the most common cause of blindness and dominates approximately 20 eye diseases. In certain existing conditions such as arthritis, newly formed capillary blood vessels invade the joints and destroy cartilage. In diabetes, new capillaries formed in the retina invade the vitreous, bleed, and cause blindness. Growth and metastasis of solid tumors are also angiogenesis-dependent (Folkman, J. (1986) Cancer Research 46:467-473 and Folkman, J. (1989) Journal of the National Cancer Institute 82:4-6). It has been shown, for example, that tumors which enlarge to greater than 2 mm, must obtain their own blood supply and do so by inducing the growth of new capillary blood vessels. Once these new blood vessels become embedded in the tumor, they provide a means for tumor cells to enter the<br><br><br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention provides angiogenesis inhibitor compounds which comprise a core, e.g., a Fumagillin core, that is believed to inhibit methionine aminopeptidase 2 (MetAP-2), coupled to a peptide. The present invention is based, at least in part, on the discovery that coupling the MetAP-2 inhibitory core to an amino acid residue or an amino acid derivative prevents the metabolic degradation of the angiogenesis inhibitor compound to ensure a superior pharmacokinetic profile and limits CNS side effects by altering the ability of the angiogenesis inhibitor compound to cross the blood brain barrier. The present invention is also based, at least in part, on the discovery that coupling the MetAP-2 inhibitory core to a peptide comprising a site-directed sequence allows for a cell specific delivery of the angiogenesis inhibitor compound and limits the toxicity of the angiogenesis inhibitor compound.<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
The present invention provides compounds useful as angiogenesis inhibitors and methods for using these compounds in the treatment of angiogenic diseases. Without intending to be limited by theory, it is believed that the angiogenesis inhibitor compoxmds of the invention inhibit angiogenesis by inhibiting methionine aminopeptidase 2 (MetAP-2), an enzyme which cleaves the N-tenninal methionine residue of newly synthesized proteins to produce the active form of the protein. At flie same time, the presence of a peptide in the angiogenesis inhibitor compounds of the invention prevents the metabolic degradation of the angiogenesis inhibitor compounds and ensures a superior pharmacokinetic profile. The presence of the peptide in the angiogenesis inhibitor compounds of the invention also alters the ability of the angiogenesis inhibitor compound to cross the blood brain barrier to, for example, limit CMS side effects (such as CNS toxicity). The presence of peptides comprising a site-directed sequence in the angiogenesis inhibitor compounds of the invention allows for a site-specific delivery of the angiogenesis inhibitor compounds and, thus, limits the toxicity of the angiogenesis inhibitor compounds.<br>
The angiogenesis inhibitor compounds of the invention comprise a MetAP-2 inhibitory core and a peptide attached, directly or indirectly, thereto. In one embodiment, the invention provides angiogenesis inhibitor compounds of Formula I<br><br><br>
In Formula I, A is a MetAP-2 inhibitory core, W is O or NR2 and R1, and R2 are each, independently; hydrogen or alkyl; X is alkylene or substituted alkylene, preferably linear C1-C6-alkylene; n is 0 or 1; R3 and R^ are each, independently, hydrogen, substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, substituted or unsubstituted aryl or arylalkyl or substituted or unsubstituted heteroaryl or heteroalkyL R3 and R4 can also, together with<br><br><br>
unsubstituted azacycloalkylalkyl group. Suitable substituted azacycloalkyl groups include azacycloalkyl groups which have an N-aDcyl substituent, preferably an N-Cj-alkyl substituent and more preferably an N-methyl substituent. R5 and R7 can also, together with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached, form a heterocyclic ring system, such as a substituted or unsubstituted five or six-membered aza or diazacycloalkyl group. Preferably, the diazacycloalkyi group includes an N-alkyl substituent, such as an N-C1-C4-alkyl substituent or, more preferably, an N-methyl substituent<br>

In Formulas I and XV, A is a MetAP-2 inhibitory core. As used herein, a "MetAP-2 inhibitory core" includes a moiety able to inhibit the activity of methionine aminopeptidase 2 (MetAP-2), e,g., the ability of MetAP-2 to cleave the N-terminal methionine residue of newly synthesized proteins to produce the active form of the protein. Preferred MetAP-2 inhibitory cores are Fumagillin derived structures.<br>
Suitable MetAP-2 inhibitory cores include the cores of Formula II,<br><br><br><br>
Where R1 R2 R3 and D have the meanings give above for Formula II, and X is a leaving group, such as a halogen.<br>
Examples of suitable MetAP-2 inhibitory cores include, but are not limited to, the following.<br><br><br>
In each of Formulas IV-X, the indicated valence on the ring carbon is the point of attachment of the structural variable W, as set forth in Formulas I-XV, In Formula IX, p is an integer from 0 to 10, preferably 1-4. In Formulas IV, V and VI-DC, R1 is hydrogen or C1-C4-alkoxy, preferably methoxy. In Formulas IV and V, the dashed line indicates that the bond can be a double bond or a single bond In Formula V, X represents a leaving group, such as a thioalkoxy group, a thioaryloxy group, a halogen or a dialkylsulfinium group. In Formulas IV and V, R1 is H, OH, amino, C1-C4-alkylamino or di(C1-C4-alkyl)amino), preferably H, In formulas in which the stereochemistry of a particular stereocenter is not indicated, that stereocenter can have either of the possible stereochemistries, consistent with the ability of the angiogenesis inhibitor compound to inhibit the activity of MetAP-2.<br>
In particularly preferred embodiments, A is the MetAP-2 inhibitory core of FormulaX below.<br><br><br><br>
The peptide contained within the angiogenesis inhibitor compounds of the invention may include a peptide cleavage site for an enzyme which is expressed at sites of angioganesis or aberrant cell proliferation, allowing tissue-selective delivery of a cell-permeable active angiogenesis inhibitor compound or fragment thereof (e.g., a fragment containing the MetAP-2 inhibitory core of the angiogenesis inhibitor compound). The peptide may also include a sequence which is a ligahd for a cell surface receptor which is e^qpressed at a site of angiogenesis or aberrant cell proUferation, thereby targeting<br><br>
angiogenesis inhibitor compounds to a cell surface of interest For example, a peptide contained within the angiogenesis inhibitor compounds of the invention can include a cleavage site for a matrix metalloproteinase, or an integrin binding RGD (Arg-Gly-Asp) sequence, or a combination of both an enzyme "cleavage" sequence and a cell surface "ligand" which serve to target the angiogenesis inhibitor compound to the membrane of an endothelial cell. However, the selection of a peptide sequence must be such that the active angiogenesis inhibitor compound is available to be delivered to the cells in which MetAP-2 inhibition is desired.<br>
For example, a sequence that is cleaved by a matrix matalloproteinase produces a product that contains the MetAP-2 inhibitory core, a coupling group, and a peptide frgment Sequences are selected so that the active angiogenesis inhibitor compound, eg,., the active angiogenesis inhibitor compound generated by the matrix matalloproteinase cleavage, is cell permeable. Preferably, the active angiogenesis inhibitor compound does not contain a free acid after the cleavage.<br>
In one embodiment, the peptide includes a cleavage site for a matrix metalloprotease, such as matrix metalloprotease-2 (MMP-2), MMP-1, MMP-3, MMP-7, MMP-8, MMP-9, MMP-12, MMP-13 or MMP-26.  Preferably, the peptide includes a cleavage site for MMP-l or MMP-9, For example, the peptide can comprise the sequence -Pro-Leu-Gly-Xaa- (SEQ ID NO: 1), where Xaa is any naturally occurring annuo acid residue consistent with matrix metalloprotease (MMP) cleavage at the Gly-<br><br><br><br>

Methods of Using the Angiogenesis Inhibitor Compounds for the Treatment of Angiogenic Disease<br>
In another embodiment, the present invention provides a method of treating an angiogenic disease in a subject The method includes administering to the subject a therapeutically effective amount of an angiogenesis inhibitor compound of the present invention, thereby treating the angiogenic disease in the subject<br>
As used herein, the term "angiogenic disease" includes a disease, disorder, or condition characterized or caused by aberrant or unwanted^ e.g-, stimulated or suppressed, formation of blood vessels (angiogenesis). Aberrant or unwanted angiogenesis may either cause a particular disease directly or exacerbate an existing pathological condition. Examples of angiogenic diseases include ocular disorders, eg., diabetic retinopathy, retinopathy of prematurity, comeal graft rejection, retrolental<br><br><br>
angiogenesis by these tumor cells, lung cancer, brain cancer, kidney cancer, colon cancer, liver cancer, pancreatic cancer, stomach cancer, prostate cancer, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, cervical cancer, melanoma, and metastatic versions of any of the preceding cancers; pediatric disorders, e.g., angiofibroma, and hemophiliac joints; blood vessel diseases such as hemangiomas, and capillary proliferation within atherosclerotic plaques; disorders associated with surgery, e.g., hypertrophic scars, wound granulation and vascular adhesions; and autoimmune diseases such as theunmatoid, immune and degenerative arthritis, where new vessels in the joint may destroy articular cartilage and scleroderma.<br><br><br>
A therapeutically effective amount of an angiogenesis inhibitor compound (ie., an effective dosage) may range from about 0.001 to 30 mg/kg body weight, preferably about 0.01 to 25 mg/kg body weight, more preferably about 0.1 to 20 mg/kg body weight, and even more preferably about 1 to 10 mg/kg, 2 to 9 mg/kg, 3 to 8 mg/kg, 4 to 7 mg/kg, or 5 to 6 mg/kg body weight. The skilled artisan will appreciate that certain factors may influence the dosage required to effectively treat a subject, including but not limited to the severity of the disease or disorder, previous treatments, the general health and/or age of the subject, and other diseases present  Moreover, treatment of a subject with a therapeutically effective amount of an autogenesis inhibitor compound can include a single treatment or, preferably, can include a series of treatments. In one example, a subject is treated with an angiogenesis inhibitor compound in the range of<br><br><br>
and the like that are physiologically compatible. The use of such media and agents for pharmaceutically active substances is well known in the art. Except insofar as any      conventional mediai or agent is incompatible with the angiogenesis inhibitor compounds, use thereof in the pharmaceutical compositions is contemplated.<br>
Supplementary phannaceutically active compounds known to treat an angiogenic disease, e.g,, a chemotherapeutic agent such as Taxol, Paclitaxel, or Actinomycin D, or an antidiabetic agent such as Tolbutamide; or compounds that may potentiate the angiogenesis inhibitory activity of the angiogenesis inhibitor compound, such as heparin or a sulfated cyclodextrin, can also be incorporated into the compositions of the invention. Suitable pharmaceutically active compounds that may be used can be found in Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine (surpra).<br><br><br>
by the use of surfactants. Prevention of the aetion of microorganisms can be achieved by various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, parabens, chlprobutariol, phenol, ascorbic acid, thimerosal, and the like. In many cases, it will be preferable to include isotonic agents, for example, sugars, polyalcohols such as manitol, sorbitol, sodium chloride; in the composition. Prolonged absorption of the injectable compositions can be brought about by including in the composition an agent which<br><br><br>
and include, for example, for transmucosal administration, detergents, bile salts, and fusidic acid derivatives, Transmucosal administration can be accomplished through the use of nasal sprays or suppositories. For transdermal administration, the angiogenesis inhibitor compounds are formulated into ointments, salves, gels, or creams as generally<br>
  r   -<br><br>
the ED50 (the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population). The dose ratio hetween toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and it can be expressed as the ratio LD50/ED50. Angiogenesis inhibitor compounds which exhibit large therapeutic indices are preferred. While angiogenesis inhibitor compounds that exhibit toxic side effects may be used, care should be taken to design a delivery system that targets such angiogenesis inhibitor compounds to the site of affected tissue in order to minimize potential damage to uninfected cells and, thereby, reduce side effects.<br>
The data obtained from the cell culture assays and animal studies can be used in<br>
formulating a range of dosage for use in humans. The dosage of such angiogenesis<br>
inhibitor compounds lies preferably within a range of circulating concentrations that<br>
include the ED50 with little or no toxicity; The dosage may vary within this range<br>
depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of adnainistration utilized. For<br>
any angiogenesis inhibitor compounds used in the methods of the invention, the<br>
therapeutically effective dose can be estimated initially from cell culture assays. A dose<br>
may be formulated in antimal models to achieve a circulating plasma concentration range<br>
that includes the IC50 (f.e., the concentration of the angiogenesis inhibitor compound<br>
which aqhieves a half-maximal inhibition of symptoms) as determined in cell culture.<br>
Such information can be used to more accurately determine useful doses in humans.<br>
Levels in plasma may be measured, for example, by high performance liquid	(<br>
chromatography.<br><br><br>
Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVE) may be isolated by perfusion of an umbilical vein with a trypsin-containing medium, HUVE may then be cultured in GIT medium (Diago Eiyou Kagafku, Co., Japan) supplemented with 2.5% fetal bovine serum<br><br><br>
The tumor growth may be determined by measuring tumor size in two directions with calipers at intervals of a few days.<br>
Finally, the ability of the angiogenesis inhibitor compounds of the invention to modulate the activity of MetAP2 may be tested as follows. Recombinant human MetAP2 may be expressed and purified from insect cells as described in Li and Chang, (1996) Biochem. Biophys.Res. Commun, 227:152-159. Various amounts of angiogenesis inhibitor compound is then added to bufferH (10 mM Hepes, pH 7.35,100 mM KCl, 10% glycerol, and 0.1 M Co 2+) containing InM purified recombinant human MetAPl and incubated at 37Â°C for 30 minutes. To start the enzymatic reaction a peptide containing a methionine residue, e.g., Met-Gly-Met, is added to the reaction mixture (to a concentration of 1 mM). Released methionine is subsequently quantified at different time points (e.g, at 0,2,3, and 5 minutes)using the method of Zou et a/. (1995) M?/. Gen Genetics 246:247-253).<br>

The angiogenesis inhibitor compounds of the invention were also tested for their ability to modulate angiogenesis using the rat aortic ring assay (RARA), For this assay, male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 125-150 grams were sacrificed by an intramuscular followed by a cardiac injection of catemine, submerged in ethanol, and transferred to a sterile culture hood for dissection. Following a mid-abdominal incision extending to the thorax, the ribs were resected to expose the thoracic cavity. The heart and lungs were moved aside to locate the thoracic aorta. The segment of the aorta distal to the aortic arch and extending to the diaphragm was removed and placed immediately in MCDB-131 medium containing 4 mM L-glutamine and 50Âµg/ml gentamycin (buffer A). Buffer A was gently pipeted through the aorta with a pipetman to remove blood. The fibrous tissue was surrounding the aorta was carefully removed and the aorta was shoed into 1-2 mm sections with sterile razor blades. The sections were collected in 50 ml conical tubes and washed five times with fresh buffer A,<br>
Twenty four-well culture plates were coated with 0.2ml autoclaved 1.5% agarose in buffer A. After the agarose solidified, the wells were filled with 1 ml bufferr A. One aortic segment was submerged in each well and incubated in a 35.5 Â°C/5% CO2 humidified incubator for 10 days. Buffer A was replaced every 2 days. The aortic segments were collected in 50 ml conical tubes and washed five timeis with fresh buffer A.<br>
One milliliter of autoclaved 1.5% agarose in buffer A was added to each well of a twenty four-well culture plate and allowed to solidify. Agarose wells were cut from the solidified agarose with eihanol-sterilized cork borers and placed in twelve-well culture plates. Collagen solution was prepared by mixing 12.8 ml Collaborative Biomedical Products rat tail type I collagen with 2 ml 7.5X Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium adjusted to pH 7 with approximately 0.2 ml IN NaOH. One hundred microliters of collagen solution was added to the base of the agarose wells and allowed to set in a 35.5 Â°C/5% CO2 humidified incubator: Three hundred micoliters of collagen solution supplemented with 0.5 nM bFGF and the desired concentration of test compound was added and an aortic segment was submerged within the upper collagen layer. Test compounds were initially dissolved in ethanol at a stock concentration of 0.1 mM, and subsequently diluted in bufifer A and finally collagen solution to obtain concentrations from 0.1 nM to 100 nM. After the collagen set, the agarose wells were surrounded by 1.5 ml buffer A supplemented with 0.5 nM bFGF and the desired concentration of test angiogenesis inhibitor compound. The buffer surroundine the<br><br>
wells was replaced every 48 hours. After seven days, the vessels protruding from the aortic rings were counted under a microscope.<br>
The results,f this assay, set forth herein in Figure 1, demonstrate that the angiogeness inhibitor compounds of the invention have excellent angiogenesis inhibitory activity (much better compared to the angiogenesis inhibitory activity of TNP-470).<br>
Example 28<br>
The plasma stabiUty of the angiogenesis inhibitor compounds of the invention was also tested in human plasma at 37Â°C (at a 20 ÂµM concentration of the angiogenesis inhibitor compound). The matrix minus the test angiogenesis inhibitor compound was equihbrated at 37Â°C for 3 minutes. The assay was initiated by addition of the test compound, and the reaction mixture was incubated in a shaking water bath at 37^C. Aliquots (lOOÂµL) were withdrawn in triplicate at 0,60, and 120 minutes and combined with 200ÂµL of ice cold acetonitrile to terminate the reaction. The supernatant was analysed by Liquid ChromatographyMass spectrometry (LC/MS) using a four point standard curve to obtain percent recovery.<br>
The parent compound remaining (relative to time 0) in the incubation mixture was plotted as a function of time; a first order exponential equation was fit to the observed data, and the elimination half-lives associated with the disappearance of the test angiogenesis inhibitor compound were determined. Results are shoAvn below in TableVI.<br><br><br><br>
Example 29<br>
The efficacy of the compound described above in example 5 was evaluated using a collagen-induced arthritis model. Briefly, syngeneic 8-week-old female Louvain rats were immunized intradermally under ether anesthesia on Day 0 with 0.5 mg chick collagen II (Genzyme, Boston, MA) solubilized in 0,1M acetic acid and emulsified in Incomplete Freund's Adjuvant (Difco, Detroit, MI). Using this method, more than 90% of rats typically develop synovitis in both hind limbs 10-14 days post immunization. Rats demonstrating definite arthritis (47 total) were entered into the study and randomly assigned to one of four protocols. The compound of example 5 was dissolved in a combination of ethanol and distilled water. The rats were dosed commencmg on day 10 post immtmization as follows: (1) control group: vehicle only daily via intravenous injection (iv) (12 rats), (2) high dose group: 30 mg/kg of the compound of example 5 iv every other day (12 rats), (3) low dose group: 15 mg/kg of the compound of example 5 iv every day (12 rats) and (4) oral group: 100 mg/kg of the compound of example 5 every other day by gavage (11 rats).<br>
Daily clinical evaluations of each paw were graded on an integer scate ranging from 0 to 4, where a score of 0 indicates a normal, unaffected limb, and 4 indicates severe joint destruction. The clinical score is the sum of the four limb scores, and has a maximum possible value of 16, Collagen induced arthritis typically develops only in the hind limbs; therefore, a score of 6 to 8 represents severe arthritis.<br>
Radiologic evaluations of the hind limbs were performed by an investigator blinded to the treatment protocol. The score assigned to each limb was based on (1) tiie degree of soft tissue swelling, (2) narrowing of the space between joints, {3) degree of periosteal new bone formation and (4) the presence of erosions or ankylosis. Each limb was scored on a scale of 1 to 3, with 1 represaiting a normal limb and 3 rq)r^enting severe joint destraction, Each rat, thus, had a maximum possible radiographic score of 6 (sum of both hind limbs).<br><br>
The results of this study are set forth in Figure 2, which presents the mean daily clinical score for each of the four groups of rats over the 19 day period following induction of clinical arthritis (day 10). The results indicate that each treatment group received a significant therapeutic benefit from the compound of example 5. Consistent with these observations, the mean radiological evaluation scores were 2,2 for the control group, 0.6 for the high dose group, 0,6 for the low dose group and 1.6 for the oral group. Thus, each group treated with the compound of example 5 received a significant benefit with regard to joint destruction compared to the control group.<br>
Example 30<br>
The compound of example 5 was also evaluated against a panel of cancer cell lines (Alley, M.C. etal (1998) Cancer Research 48: 589-601; Grever, M.R., et al (1992) Seminars in Oncology, Vol 19, No. 6, pp 622-638; Boyd, M.R., and Paull, K.D. (1995) Drug Development Research 34:91-109). The human tumor cell lines of the cancer screening panel were grown in RPMI1640 medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum and 2 mM L-glutamine. Cells were inoculated into 96 well microtiter plates in 100 ÂµL at plating densities ranging from 5,000 to 40,000 cells/well depending on the doubling time of individual cell lines. After cell inoculation, the microtiter plates were incubated at 37Â° C, 5 % CO2,95 % air and 100 % relative humidity for 24 hours prior to addition of experimental drugs.<br>
After the 24 hour incubation period, two plates of each cell line were fixed in situ with TCA, to represent a measurement of the cell population for each cell line at the time of drug addition (Tz), Experimental drags were solubilized in dimethyl sulfoxide at 400-fold the desired final maximum test concentration and stored frozen prior to use. At the tune of drug addition, an aliquot of frozen concentrate was thawed and diluted to twice the desired final maxunum test concentratin with complete medium containing 50 Âµg/ml gentamicin. Additional four, 10-fold or Â½ log serial dilutions were made to provide a total of five drug concentrations plus control, Aliquots of 100 Âµl of these different drag dilutions were added to the appropriate microtiter wells already containing 100 yX of medium, resulting in the required final drag concentrations.<br>
Followiug drag addition, the plates were incubated for an additional 48 hours at 37Â°C, 5 % CO2, 95 % air, and 100 % relative humidity. For adherent cells, the assay was terminated by the addition of cold TCA. Cells were fixed in situ by the gentle addition of 50 Âµl of cold 50 % (w/v) TCA (final concentration, 10 % TCA) and incubated for 60 minutes at 4Â°C. The supernatant was discarded, and the plates were washed five times with tap water and air dried. Sulforhodamine B (SRB) solution (100<br><br>
Âµ1) at 0.4 % (w/v) in 1 % acetic acid were added to each well, and plates were incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature. After staining, unbound dye was removed by washing five times with 1 % acetic acid and the plates were air dried. Bound stain was subsequently solubilized with 10 mM trizma base, and the absorbance was read on an automated plate reader at a wavelength of 515 nm. For suspension of the cells, the methodology used was the same except that the assay was terminated by fixing settled cells at the bottom of the wells by gently addmg 50 Âµl of 80 % TCA (final concentration, 16 % TCA). Using the seven absorbance measurements [time zero, (Tz), control growth, (C), and test growth in the presence of dmg at the five concentration levels (Ti)3, the percentage growth was calculated at each of the drug concentrations levels.<br>
Percentage growth inhibition was calculated as:<br>
[(Ti-Tz)/(C-Tz)] X100 for concentrations for which Ti&gt;/=T2 [(Ti-Tz)/Tz] X 100 for concentrations for which Ti<tz.></tz.>
Growth mhibition of 50 % (GI50) was calculated firom [(Ti-Tz)/(C-Tz)] x 100 = 50, which is the drug concentration resultiag in a 50% reduction in the net protein increase (as measured by SRB staining) in control cells during the drug incubation. The GI50 was calculated for each of the cell lines if the level of activity is reached; however, if the effect was npt reached or is exceeded, the value for that parameter is expressed as greater or less than the maximum (10-4 M) or minimum (10-6 M) concentration tested;<br><br><br><br><br>
Results<br>
The results of the cell line screen, presented in 1 aoie vIII, show that.the compound of example 5 has a significant inhibitory effect on a wide variety of tumor cell lines. The results also show that certain cell lines are much more sensitive to the compound of example 5 than are others, indicating that this compound is selective for certain cell lines.<br><br>
