The invention of this application discloses a buckle, for use particularly, but not exclusively in baling and bundling and a method of securing straps, particularly but not exclusively, about baled material or bundled material or the like.<br>
Packaging of material into relatively small bundles or the like is typically referred<br>
to as baling. Numerous materials such as fabrics (natural or synthetic), agricultural<br>
products, boxed products, waste products or indeed any such material that it is<br>
desired to form into discrete and transportable bundles may be the subject of<br>
baling. It is known from the prior art to use ropes, straps, bands or the like and to<br>
connect ends of said ropes, straps, bands or the like and to join the ends together so<br>
as to form a continuous loop about the baled material. Furthermore it is known to<br>
use knots or clips or buckles or locks so as to facilitate the joining together of ends<br>
of strapping whereby strapping can be tensioned so as to maintain the baled<br>
material in a compressed state.   In some instances the pressure within the baled<br>
material is harnessed so as to enhance the strength of the strapping about the baled<br>
material. Notably, baled material, in its compressed state, exerts pressure upon any<br>
containment  means   therefore   connection/attachment  means   that   can  prevent<br>
slipping of the strapping material is important so as to keep the material in a<br>
compressed state.<br>
However, conventional connection attachments are prone to failure, either by failure of the connection/attachment means itself or failure of the strapping. In the instance of a failure of either component the compressed baled material expands and can escape and scatter. The baled material can therefore be damaged in so doing and thus this scenario is potentially inconvenient and hazardous at the site of where the contents spill or to somebody transporting said baled material or the recipient of the baled goods. Furthermore failure of the components can be costly due to breakages of fragile baled material and the like. It is important economically, and for ease of transport, to compress material into as small a volume as possible so as to reduce transportation costs and to maintain the<br><br>
2<br>
compressed state of baled material over prolonged periods during storage and transportation.<br>
Typically, baled material is constrained by multiple straps usually in the region of 6 to 15 crossing straps per bale are used and connection/attachments means. The strap may be any width that is needed to contain the compressed material. Where it is desirable to contain highly compressed bales strapping material is typically constructed of metal or toughened polypropylene or polyester, natural or synthetic cord including rope and fashioned so as to withstand high compression forces. Typically hand applied buckles only provide downwards of 50% efficiency, therefore in the instance of wishing to provide a fail safe and more efficient means<br>
of baling using hand applied buckles there is a deficiency in the market.<br>
Some materials, such as wood or forestry material or wood products, especially in the instance of being left to mature, undergo natural shrinkage. Thus, a bale of wood that has been bailed can reduce in size over time. Typically the straps are removed and replaced with new tight strapping, accordingly there is considerable wastage of bale straps and component parts thereof Thus, a buckle that permits in situ re-tensioning of straps would offer immediate advantage, further advantage would be gained if said buckle could also provide a one way only bite i.e. the same principle as a barbed fishing hook, so as to provide secure and non-slip tensioning about baled material. Such a device and method for re-tensioning would provide an immediate solution to problems in the packaging industry of bailing materials that are prone to natural shrinkage over time and during selected conditions such as during transit and for materials baled on or about a wooden pallet or the like.<br>
Furthermore, current connection/attachment means are disposable and therefore can be considered environmentally unfriendly, it would therefore be advantageous to provide a buckle which is capable of withstanding high forces for prolonged periods and which can be used and re-tensioned many times over, additionally the<br><br>
3 buckle may be made of recyclable material.<br>
The invention of this application has overcome many of the problems associated with the prior art by providing a novel buckle whereby efficient hand appliance is improved dramatically and further, reliability of baling is also improved. Additionally said novel buckle and associated strapping can be re-tensioned so as to bale material that is prone to natural shrinkage over a period of time or as a result of specific conditions.<br>
It is therefore a first object of the invention to provide an efficient buckle for baling compressed material.<br>
It is yet a further object of the invention to provide a non-slip, versatile, re-usable buckle.<br>
It is a yet further object of the invention to provide a buckle which enables retensioning of strapping associated therewith.<br>
According to a first aspect of the invention there is provided a buckle comprising<br>
comprising an elongate body which   incorporates separate spaced-apart strap-securing means through each of which, in use, a strap end can be threaded then be pulled through the buckle to tighten the buckled strap progressively around baled or bundled material;<br>
each of the said strap-securing means comprising a pair of opposed gripping members or jaws between which the associated strap end can be passed and around which the adjacent region of the remainder of the strap can then be looped back upon itself in a manner which will allow the strap parts to slide against one another as the strap is pulled through the buckle:<br>
and with each such pair of jaws being offset from the other pair with respect to a generally central rotational axis in such a way so that the forces acting on the<br><br>
4<br>
buckle create a turning moment urging the buckle to rotate through substantially 180Â° about said axis thereby frictionally trapping the strap parts in the buckle.<br>
It will be understood that in use, an end of a first strap is secured by threading same between and about at least one of the gripping members at one end of said buckle, and another end of said same strap, or alternatively, an end of a different strap is secured by threading same between and about at least one of the gripping members at the other end of said buckle. Thereafter, the free end(s) of the strap or straps, held by the gripping members, are pulled or tensioned in opposite directions until a turning moment is reached and this causes the elongate body of the buckle to rotate about the turning point by approximately 180Â° and in doing so the gripping members are wrapped further and, in use essentially irreversibly, about said strap or straps. In this way, advantageously, the gripping force is co-directional with the constraining force.<br>
In a yet further preferred embodiment of the invention said buckle comprises ideally, a single component ideally with at least one access region, whereby said strap is threaded through same and about said gripping members.<br>
In a yet further preferred embodiment of the invention said buckle is constructed from a robust, rust-proof, durable material ideally from plastics and more ideally is high pressure injection moulded from said plastics and even more ideally is provided as a composite of plastics and filled glass fibres preferably said fibres are nylon filled and more preferably still are polycarbonate filled.<br>
In a yet further preferred embodiment of the invention said buckle is provided preformed and is attached to or associated with at least one end of a predetermined length of said strap.<br><br>
5<br>
In a yet further preferred embodiment of the invention said first and second gripping members are substantially elongate and even more ideally each of said second gripping members is marginally greater in length than each of said first gripping members.<br>
In a yet further preferred embodiment of the invention said first gripping member is provided with at least one recess suitably positioned, and of a pre-determined length, along at least one side; and ideally is provided with a second recess along an opposite side and even more ideally said recesses are of equal length and are positioned at an end of said gripping member wherein said end is the end nearest said turning point. This construction provides a first gripping member with a flexible nose portion.<br>
In a yet further preferred embodiment of the invention said first gripping member is of differential cross-sectional thickness along its length, a thickest cross-sectional area being at an end remote from said turning point. Thus the first gripping member is ideally wedge shaped.<br>
In a yet further preferred embodiment of the invention said first gripping member comprises a nose portion substantially positioned between said recesses, ideally said nose portion is suitably resilient and even more ideally said nose portion is suitably curved at an edge nearest said turning point, the angle of curvature is selected so as to improve performance and most ideally said nose portion is of a suitable thickness so as to be resilient.<br>
It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art of providing a buckle that the angle of curvature of said nose portion is directly proportional to the efficiency of said buckle and that, the greater the angle of curvature, the greater the efficiency achieved. In this way, in use, a strap is wrapped about a curved gripping member and so the risk of damaging said strap is minimised.   Furthermore by providing a<br><br>
6<br>
gripping member of differential cross-sectional thickness along its length, the thickest part being remote from said turning point, with recesses along at least a part of a thinner nose portion such configuration confers resiliency to said nose portion, so that in use said nose portion deforms and presses against at least a first part of the strap.<br>
In a yet further preferred embodiment of the invention said nose portion is constructed of a different material to said gripping member, and said nose portion is suitably and permanently attached thereto. However it will be appreciated that said nose portion is ideally integral with said gripping member of said securing means, but in some instances it may be made separately of a different resiliently deformable material and securely affixed to said gripping member.<br>
In a yet further preferred embodiment of the invention said second gripping member is of substantially even cross-sectional area along its length and comprises a curved end, said curved end being nearest to said turning point, ideally said end is curved so as not to present sharp or right angled edges to a strap means and create weak point(s). Notably also, said curved end of said second gripping member cooperates with said curved nose portion so as to provide almost a continuous curved surface against which said strap bears during use.<br>
According to a second aspect of the invention there is provided use of a buckle as hereinbefore described in baling compressed material.<br>
According to a further aspect of the invention there is provided use of a buckle as hereinbefore described in baling material that is prone to natural shrinkage over a period of time or as a result of specific conditions.<br>
The present invention also provides, a method of securing two parts of a strap relative to each other about baled material comprising:<br><br>
7<br>
i)	placing at least a part of one strap means about at least a part of<br>
material that is to be baled, and providing at least one buckle as described hereinbefore,<br>
ii)        inserting an end of a strap a selected distance into an access portion of said elongate body of said buckle;<br>
iii)       threading said strap between and about at least one of said gripping members;<br>
iv)       repeating steps ii) and iii) at the other end of said elongate body where appropriate, using the same or an alternative strap;<br>
v)	applying suitable, substantially equal and opposite tension to<br>
selected end(s) of said strap so as to reach and overcome a turning moment, rotating said clip by approximately 180Â° whereby said strap(s) is/are wrapped about said securing means and a clamping force is applied to said strap(s).<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the method as hereinbefore described, said baled material is prone to natural shrinkage over a period of time or as a result of specific conditions, comprising the step of<br>
vi)       re-tensioning said strap(s) about said baled material that has<br>
undergone natural shrinkage, by applying a suitable re-tensioning force by means of a standard re-tensioning tool to selected end(s) of said strap(s) so as to advance said strap(s) over said gripping means in a non-reversible fashion;<br>
vii)      repeating step vi) as appropriate in accordance with the rate and extent of natural shrinkage of said baled material.<br><br>
8<br>
According to yet a further aspect of the invention there is provided use of a buckle as hereinbefore described and component parts thereof in baling material.<br>
According to a yet further aspect of the invention there is provided use of a buckle as hereinbefore described and component parts thereof in baling material that is prone to nature shrinkage over a period of time or as a result of specific conditions.<br>
The invention will now be described by way of example only with reference to the following accompanying drawings wherein:-<br>
Figure 1 represents a plan view of a buckle.<br>
Figure 2 represents a side cross-sectional view through line A - A' of a buckle as shown in Figure 1.<br>
Figure 3 represents an end view of a buckle.<br>
Figure 4 represents a side cross-sectional view through a buckle along line B - B' as shown in Figure 2.<br>
Figures 5 A to F represent side cross-sectional views of a buckle during the process of threading and securing a strap.<br>
Figure 6 represents an exploded view of Figure 5F.<br>
With reference to Figure 1 there is shown a buckle 1 comprising an elongate body 2 with ends X and Y defining an essentially open central access region 7. At either end of buckle 1 there is provided a securing means comprising a first and second gripping members. At end Y the securing means comprises members 3B and 4B; and at end X the securing means comprises members 3A and 4A. At an end Y of<br><br>
9<br>
buckle 1 there is shown a second gripping member 3B which is superimposed over a first gripping member (not shown) which member is provided with a pair of recesses 6B (shown as dotted lines). At an opposite end X a first gripping member 4A is shown provided with visible recess portions 5A, the area between said recesses essentially defining a nose portion 8. Centrally positioned in region 7 there exists a turning point about which the buckle rotates in use and under sufficient applied tensioning force as will be described in greater detail hereinafter.<br>
With reference now to Figure 2 there is shown a side cross-sectional view of buckle 1 through line A to A' as depicted in Figure 1, in this particular view of buckle 1, it is apparent that the securing means at end X and the other securing means at end Y are positioned so that their central longitudinal axis is parallel with a central longitudinal axis (C to C') but notably said securing means at ends X and Y are displaced on opposite sides of said central longitudinal axis (C to C ').<br>
The securing means comprises oppositely positioned first and second gripping members. At either end of the buckle 1 first and second gripping members are space thereapart so as to provide a cavity 9 of suitable size so that a strap can be threaded therethrough.<br>
Each of said first gripping members are provided with resilient nose portions 8A and 8B. In this embodiment of the invention nose portions 8A and 8B are made from a plastics material and the fashioning of the same by the inclusion of recesses 5A, 5B, 6A, 6B confers on the tip of nose portions 8A and 8B resilience. In other embodiments of the invention resilience of this kind may be provided using other, means known to those skilled in the art. A second transverse central axis B to 'B' is shown wherein the intersection of axes B to B' and C to C' define a plane Z which plane defines the turning point about which buckle 1 rotates in use when the turning moment has reached a critical point.<br><br>
10<br>
It will be appreciated that in the representation of an end view of a buckle as depicted in Figure 3 each end is provided with a first gripping member (4A and 4B) and a second gripping member (3A and 3B) and in between each of these members there is cavity 9; additionally midway between each of said pairs of gripping members is central access region 7.<br>
With reference to Figure 4, which illustrates a side cross-sectional view of buckle 1 along line B to B' as illustrated in Figure 2 there is shown more clearly access region 7 between two sides of elongate body 2. It will be appreciated that sides of elongate body 2 are substantially rounded so as not to present sharp surfaces/edges to a strap and create weak points.<br>
In use, with reference to Figure 5 A to F, a part or end of a strap 10 is passed through access region 7 of buckle 1 towards end Y of said buckle so as to pass along at least a part of a surface of first gripping member 4B. Subsequently, with reference to Figure 5B strap 10 is threaded between said first and second gripping members through region 9 so as to fold back upon itself and to effectively wrap around first gripping member 4B. A free end 10A projects outwardly from buckle 1 on a right hand side. Subsequently (Figure 5C) a second end of a strap 11 is threaded similarly through central access region 7 so as to pass by first gripping member 4A at an opposite end. Said strap is then folded around the first gripping member of the opposite end so as to be wrapped around same, and to provide an end 11A which projects outwardly from buckle 1 on a left hand side (Figure 5D). Tension is then applied in opposite directions as indicated by the arrows on Figure 5E along the length of straps 10 and 11 so as to cause buckle 1 to rotate about a plane running through turning point Z. As the buckle rotates straps 10 and 11 are wrapped further about the securing means and specifically about the second gripping members, moreover when the buckle has rotated approximately 180Â° (Figure 5F) fiirther tensioning causes nose portions 8A and SB of said first gripping members to be depressed and to firmly press against second gripping members<br><br>
11<br>
sandwiching a part of a strap therebetween. Thus the nose portions 8A and 8B and the curved innermost ends of second gripping members 3A and 3B provide a curved surface against which straps 10 and 11 bear in use. In an alternative embodiment of the invention, not shown, a single strap may be threaded between ends X and Y of buckle 1. Furthermore it will be appreciated that in the instance of baling material that is prone to natural shrinkage said strap(s) 10 and 11 can be selectively re-tensioned.<br>
With reference to Figure 5F there is shown an exploded view in Figure 6, where it can be seen that strap 10 is wrapped about a first gripping member 4B so as to depress nose portion 8B along surface 12 towards second gripping member 3B whilst sandwiching said strap therebetween. It will be appreciated that a double thickness of strap comprising 10 and 10A exits at an area 13B at end Y of buckle 1. It will be apparent from this figure that the gripping force holding strap 10 (and 11) in place is co-directional with the constraining force when the strap(s) and buckle are in use. This arrangement maximises the efficiency of the invention.<br>
It will be appreciated, by those skilled in the art, that in the instance of baling material that is prone to natural shrinkage over a selected period of time or as a result of specific conditions, said strap 10 or 11 may be re-tensioned by using a standard re-tensioning tool and applying a suitable re-tensioning force to ends 10A or 11A so as to permit straps 10 or 11 to advance further over nose portion(s) 8B or 8A in a non-reversible manner.<br>
Thus, in use, the buckle of the invention provides a novel, inventive, secure and essentially irreversible means for securing parts of straps, ideally about compressed baled material or baled material that is prone to shrinkage. The device is efficient, reusable, and may be easily and quickly applied by hand and may be re-tensioned as appropriate without removing said buckle or said strap(s) from or about said baled material.<br><br>
