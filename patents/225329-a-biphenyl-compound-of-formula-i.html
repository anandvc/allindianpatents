				<td>The present invention relates to a biphenyl compound of formula I.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to novel biphenyl derivatives that are useful for treating pulmonary disorders. This invention also relates to pharmaceutical compositions comprising such biphenyl derivatives, processes and intermediates for preparing such biphenyl derivatives and methods of using such biphenyl derivatives to treat pulmonary disorders.<br>
State of the Art<br>
Pulmonary disorders, such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), are commonly treated with bronchodilators. One class of bronchodilator in widespread use consists of ß2 adrenergic receptor (adrenoceptor) agonists, such as albuterol, formoterol and salmeterol. These compounds are generally administered by inhalation. Another class of bronchodilator consists of muscarinic receptor antagonists (anticholinergic compounds), such as ipratropium and tiotropium. These compounds are also typically administered by inhalation.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions containing both a ß2 adrenergic receptor agonist and a muscarinic receptor antagonist are also known in the art for use in treating pulmonary disorders. For example, U.S. Patent No. 6,433,027 discloses medicament compositions containing a muscarinic receptor antagonist, such as tiotropium bromide, and a ß2 adrenergic receptor agonist, such as formoterol furnarate.<br>
Although compounds having either ß2 adrenergic receptor agonist or muscarinic receptor antagonist activity are known, no compound having both ß2 adrenergic receptor<br><br>
agonist and muscarinic receptor antagonist activity has been previously disclosed. Compounds possessing both pz adrenergic receptor agonist and muscarinic receptor antagonist activity are highly desirable since such biranctional compounds would provide bronchodilation through two independent modes of action while having single molecule pharmacokinetics.<br>

When determining the number of contiguous atoms in the shortest chain between the two nitrogen atoms to which R4 is attached, each contiguous atom of the chain is counted consecutively starting from the first atom in the R4 group adjacent to the nitrogen of the piperidine ring ending with the last atom in the R4 group adjacent to the nitrogen of the aminohydroxyethyl group. Where two or more chains are possible, the shortest chain is used to determine the number of contiguous atoms. As shown below, for example, when R4 is -(CH2)2-NHC(O)-CH2-(phen-l,4-ylene)-CH2-, there are 10 contiguous atoms in the shortest chain counted consecutively starting from the first atom in the R4 group adjacent to the nitrogen of the piperidine ring ending with the last atom in the R4 group adjacent to the nitrogen of the aminohydroxyethyl group as shown below:<br>

Although a particular embodiment of the present invention may be shown or described herein, those skilled in the art will recognize that all embodiments or aspects of the present invention can be prepared using the methods described herein or by using other methods, reagents and<br>
starting materials known to those skilled in the art. It will also be appreciated that where typical or preferred process conditions (i.e., reaction temperatures, times, mole ratios of reactants, solvents, pressures, etc.) are given, other process conditions can also be used unless otherwise stated. While the optimum reaction conditions may vary depending on the particular reactants or solvent used, such conditions can be readily determined by one skilled in the art by routine optimization procedures.<br>
Additionally, as will be apparent to those skilled in the art, conventional protecting groups may be necessary or desired to prevent certain functional groups from undergoing undesired reactions. The choice of a suitable protecting group for a particular functional group as well as suitable conditions for protection and deprotection of such functional groups are well-known in the art. Protecting groups other than those illustrated in the procedures described herein may be used, if desired.

The biphenyl derivatives of this invention are typically administered to a patient in the form of a pharmaceutical composition or formulation. Such pharmaceutical compositions may be administered to the patient by any acceptable route of administration including, but not limited to, inhaled, oral, nasal, topical (including transdermal) and parenteral modes of administration.   It will be understood that any form of the compounds of this invention, (i.e., free base, pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, etc.) that is suitable for the particular mode of administration can be used in the pharmaceutical compositions discussed herein.<br>
Accordingly, in one of its compositions aspects, this invention is directed to a pharmaceutical composition comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient and a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. Optionally, such pharmaceutical compositions may contain other therapeutic and/or formulating agents if desired.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of this invention typically contain a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the present invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. Typically, such pharmaceutical compositions will contain from about 0.01 to about 95% by weight of the active agent; including, from about 0.01 to about 30% by weight; such as from about 0.01 to about 10% by weight of the active agent.<br>

The choice of a particular carrier or excipient, or combinations of carriers or exipients, will depend on the mode of administration being used to treat a particular patient or type of medical condition or disease state. In this regard, the preparation of a suitable pharmaceutical composition for a particular mode of administration is well within the scope of those skilled in the pharmaceutical arts. Additionally, the ingredients for such compositions are commercially available from, for example, Sigma, P.O. Box 14508, St. Louis, MO 63178. By way of further illustration, conventional formulation techniques are described in Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, 20th Edition, Lippincott Williams &amp; White, Baltimore, Maryland (2000); and H.C. Ansel et al., Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms and Drug Delivery Systems, 7th Edition, Lippincott Williams &amp; White, Baltimore, Maryland (1999).<br>

The pharmaceutical compositions of mis invention are typically prepared by thoroughly and intimately mixing or blending a compound of the invention with a Dharmaceutically acceptable carrier and one or more optional ingredients. If necessary or iesired, the resulting uniformly blended mixture can then be shaped or loaded into tablets, capsules, pills, canisters, cartridges, dispensers and the like using conventional procedures uid equipment.<br>
In one embodiment, the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention are suitable for inhaled administration. Suitable pharmaceutical compositions for inhaled idministration will typically be in the form of an aerosol or a powder. Such compositions are generally administered using well-known delivery devices, such as a nebulizer inhaler, i metered-dose inhaler (MDI), a dry powder inhaler (DPI) or a similar delivery device.<br>
In a specific embodiment of this invention, the pharmaceutical composition comprising the active agent is administered by inhalation using a nebulizer inhaler. Such lebulizer devices typically produce a stream of high velocity air that causes the sharmaceutical composition comprising the active agent to spray as a mist that is carried into the patient's respiratory tract. Accordingly, when formulated for use in a nebulizer inhaler, the active agent is typically dissolved in a suitable carrier to form a solution. Alternatively, the active agent can be micronized and combined with a suitable carrier to form a suspension of micronized particles of respirable size, where micronized is typically Jefined as having about 90% or more of the particles with a diameter of less than about 10 rai. Suitable nebulizer devices are provided commercially, for example, by PAR! GmbH ^Starnberg, German). Other nebulizer devices include Respimat (Boehringer Ingelheim) md those disclosed, for example, in U.S. Patent No. 6,123,068 and WO 97/12687.<br>
A representative pharmaceutical composition for use in a nebulizer inhaler comprises an isotonic aqueous solution comprising from about 0.05 ug/mL to about 10 mg/mL of a compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate or stereoisomer thereof.<br>
In another specific embodiment of this invention, the pharmaceutical composition comprising the active agent is administered by inhalation using a dry powder inhaler. Such dry powder inhalers typically administer the active agent as a free-flowing powder that is<br>
dispersed in a patient's air-stream during inspiration. In order to achieve a free flowing powder, the active agent is typically formulated with a suitable excipient such as lactose or starch.<br>
A representative pharmaceutical composition for use in a dry powder inhaler comprises dry lactose having a particle size between about 1 um and about 100 um and micronized particles of a compound of formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate or stereoisomer thereof.<br>
Such a dry powder formulation can be made, for example, by combining the lactose with the active agent and then dry blending the components. Alternatively, if desired, the active agent can be formulated without an excipient. The pharmaceutical composition is then typically loaded into a dry powder dispenser, or into inhalation cartridges or capsules for use with a dry powder delivery device.<br>
Examples of dry powder inhaler delivery devices include Diskhaler (GlaxoSmithKline, Research Triangle Park, NC) (see, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 5,035,237); Diskus (GlaxoSmithKline) (see, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 6,378,519; Turbuhaler (AstraZeneca, Wilmington, DE) (see, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 4,524,769); Rotahaler (GlaxoSmithKline) (see, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 4,353,365) and Handihaler (Boehringer Ingelheim). Further examples of suitable DPI devices are described in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,415,162,5,239,993, and 5,715,810 and references cited therein.<br>
In yet another specific embodiment of this invention, the pharmaceutical composition comprising the active agent is administered by inhalation using a metered-dose inhaler. Such metered-dose inhalers typically discharge a measured amount of the active agent or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof using compressed propellent gas. Accordingly, pharmaceutical compositions administered using a metered-dose inhaler typically comprise a solution or suspension of the active agent in a liquefied propellant Any suitable liquefied propellant may be employed including chlorofluorocarbons, such as CClaF, and hydrofluoroalkanes (HFAs), such as 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane (HFA 134a) and 1,1,1,2,3,3,3-heptafluoro-n-propane, (HFA 227). Due to concerns about chlorofluorocarbons affecting the ozone layer, formulations containing HFAs are generally preferred. Additional optional components of HFA formulations include co-solvents, such as ethanol or pentane, and surfactants, such as sorbitan trioleate, oleic acid, lecithin, and glycerin. See, for example, U.S. Patent No. 5,225,183, EP 0717987 A2, and WO 92/22286.<br>
A representative pharmaceutical composition for use in a metered-dose inhaler comprises from about 0.01 % to about 5 % by weight of a compound of formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate or stereoisomer thereof; from about 0 % to about 20 % by weight ethanol; and from about 0 % to about 5 % by weight surfactant; with the remainder being an HFA propellant.<br>
Such compositions are typically prepared by adding chilled or pressurized hydrofluoroalkane to a suitable container containing the active agent, ethanol (if present) and the surfactant (if present). To prepare a suspension, the active agent is micronized and then combined with the propellant. The formulation is then loaded into an aerosol canister, which forms a portion of a metered-dose inhaler device. Examples of metered-dose inhaler devices developed specifically for use with HFA propellants are provided in U.S. Patent Nos. 6,006,745 and 6,143,277. Alternatively, a suspension formulation can be prepared by spray drying a coating of surfactant on micronized particles of the active agent. See, for example, WO 99/53901 and WO 00/61108.<br>
For additional examples of processes of preparing respirable particles, and formulations and devices suitable for inhalation dosing see U.S. Patent Nos. 6,268,533, 5,983,956, 5,874,063, and 6,221,398, and WO 99/55319 and WO 00/30614.<br>
In another embodiment, the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention are suitable for oral administration.

Utility<br>
The biphenyl derivatives of this invention possess both p2 adrenergic receptor agonist and muscarinic receptor antagonist activity and therefore, such compounds are useful for treating medical conditions mediated by 02 adrenergic receptors or muscarinic receptors, i.e., medical conditions that are ameliorated by treatment with a £2 adrenergic receptor agonist or a muscarinic receptor antagonist. Such medical conditions include, by way of example, pulmonary disorders or diseases associated with reversible airway obstruction, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (e.g., chronic and wheezy bronchitis and emphysema), asthma, pulmonary fibrosis and the like. Other conditions which maybe treated include premature labor, depression, congestive heart failure, skin diseases (e.g., inflammatory, allergic, psoriatic and proliferative skin diseases, conditions where lowering peptic acidity is desirable (e.g., peptic and gastric ulceration) and muscle wasting disease.<br>
Accordingly, in one embodiment, this invention is directed to a method for treating a pulmonary disorder, the method comprising administering to a patient in need of treatment a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula I or a phannaceuticaHy acceptable salt or solvate or stereoisomer thereof. When used to treat a pulmonary disorder, the compounds of this invention will typically be administered by inhalation in multiple doses per day, in a single daily dose or a single weekly dose. Generally, the dose for treating a pulmonary disorder will range from about 10 ug/day to about 200 ug/day.<br>
When administered by inhalation, the compounds of this invention typically have the effect of providing bronchodilation. Accordingly, in another of its method aspects, this invention is directed to a method of providing bronchodilation in a patient, the method comprising administering to a patient requiring bronchodilation a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula I or a phannaceuticaHy acceptable salt or solvate or stereoisomer thereof. Generally, the dose for providing bronchodilation will range from about 10 ug/day to about 200 ug/day.<br>
In one embodiment, this invention is directed to a method of treating chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma, the method comprising administering to a patient in need of treatment a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate or stereoisomer thereof. When used to treat a COPD or asthma, the compounds of this invention will typically be administered by<br>
nhalation in multiple doses per day or in a single daily dose. Generally, the dose for reating COPD or asthma will range from about 10 ug/day to about 200 fig/day.<br>
As used herein, COPD includes chronic obstructive bronchitis and emphysema (see, for example, Barnes, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, NEnglJMed 2000: 343:269-78).<br>
When used to treat a pulmonary disorder, the compounds of this invention are optionally administered in combination with other therapeutic agents. In particular, by combining the compounds of this invention with a steroidal anti-inflammatory agent (e.g. a corticosteroid), the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention can provide triple therapy, i.e., fa adrenergic receptor agonist, muscarinic receptor antagonist and anti-inflammatory activity, using only two active components. Since pharmaceutical compositions containing two active components are typically easier to formulate compared to compositions containing three active components, such two component compositions provide a significant advantage over compositions containing three active components. Accordingly, in a particular embodiment, the pharmaceutical compositions and methods of this invention further comprise a therapeutically effective amount of a steroidal anti-inflammatory agent.<br>
Compounds of this invention exhibit both muscarinic receptor antagonist and fa adrenergic receptor agonist activity. Accordingly, among other properties, compounds of particular interest are those that demonstrate an inhibitory constant K; value for binding at the ms muscarinic receptor and an ECso value for 02 adrenergic receptor agonist activity of less than about 100 nM; particularly less than 10 nM. Among these compounds, compounds of special interest include those having muscarinic activity, expressed in terms of the inhibitory constant Kj for binding at the ms muscarinic receptor, that is about equal to the compound's fa adrenergic agonist activity, expressed in terms of the half maximal effective concentration ECso, as determined in the in vitro assays described herein, or in similar assays. For example, compounds of particular interest are those having a ratio of the inhibitory constant K; for the Ma muscarinic receptor to the ECso for the fa adrenergic receptor ranging from about 30:1 to about 1:30; including about 20:1 to about 1:20; such as about 10:1 to about 1:10.<br>
In one of its method aspects, the present invention also provides a method for treating a pulmonary disorder, the method comprising administering to a patient in need of<br>
!<br>
treatment a therapeutically effective amount of a compound having both muscarinic<br>
receptor antagonist and p2 adrenergic receptor agonist activity. In a particular embodiment of this method, the compound administered has an inhibitory constant K\ for the M3 muscarinic receptor that is less than about 100 nM and a half maximal effective concentration ECSO for agonism at the p2 adrenergic receptor that is less than about 100 nM. In another embodiment, the method for treating a pulmonary disorder comprises administering a therapeutically effective amount of a compound for which the ratio of the inhibitory constant K; for the ms muscarinic receptor to the ECso for agonism of the p2 adrenergic receptor is between about 30:1 and about 1:30.<br>
Since compounds of this invention possess both p2 adrenergic agonist activity and muscarinic receptor antagonist activity, such compounds are also useful as research tools for investigating or studying biological systems or samples having p2 adrenergic receptors or muscarinic receptors, or for discovering new compounds having both p2 adrenergic agonist activity and muscarinic receptor antagonist activity. Such biological systems or samples may comprise Pa adrenergic receptors and/or muscarinic receptors. Any suitable biological system or sample having p2 adrenergic and/or muscarinic receptors may be employed in such studies which may be conducted either in vitro or in vivo. Representative biological systems or samples suitable for such studies include, but are not limited to, cells, cellular extracts, plasma membranes, tissue samples, mammals (such as mice, rats, guinea pigs, rabbits, dogs, pigs, etc.), and the like.<br>
In this embodiment, a biological system or sample comprising a p2 adrenergic receptor or a muscarinic receptor is contacted with a p2 adrenergic receptor-agonizing or muscarinic receptor-antagonizing amount of a compound of this invention. The effects are then determined using conventional procedures and equipment, such as radioligand binding assays and functional assays. Such functional assays include ligand-mediated changes in intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), ligand-mediated changes in activity of the enzyme adenylyi cyclase (which synthesizes cAMP), ligand-mediated changes in incorporation of guanosine 5'-O-( -thio)triphosphate ([35S]GTP S) into isolated membranes via receptor catalyzed exchange of [35S]GTP S for GDP, ligand-mediated changes in free intracellular calcium ions (measured, for example, with a fluorescence-linked imaging plate reader or FLIPR® from Molecular Devices, Inc.). A compound of this invention will agonize or cause activation of a p2 adrenergic receptor and antagonize or decrease the activation of muscarinic receptors in any of the functional<br>
assays listed above, or assays of a similar nature. The amount of compound used in these studies will typically range from about 0.1 nanomolar to about 100 nanomolar.<br>
Additionally, the compounds of this invention can be used as research tools for discovering new compounds that have both a 02 adrenergic receptor agonist and muscarinic receptor antagonist activity. In this embodiment, a 02 adrenergic receptor and muscarinic receptor binding data (for example, as determined by in vitro radioligand displacement assays) for a test compound or a group of test compounds is compared to the 02 adrenergic receptor and muscarinic receptor binding data for a compound of this invention to identify those test compounds that have about equal or superior 02 adrenergic receptor and/or muscarinic receptor binding, if any. This aspect of the invention includes, as separate embodiments, both the generation of comparison data (using the appropriate assays) and the analysis of the test data to identify test compounds of interest.<br>
In some cases, compounds of this invention may possess either weak muscarinic receptor antagonist activity or weak 02 adrenergic receptor agonist activity. In these cases, those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that such compounds still have utility as primarily either a 02 adrenergic receptor agonist or a muscarinic receptor antagonist, respectively.<br>
The properties and utility of the compounds of this invention can be demonstrated using various in vitro and in vivo assays well-known to those skilled in the art. For example, representative assays are described in further detail in the following Examples.<br>

Binding assays were performed in 96-well microtiter plates in a total assay volume of 100 ^L with 10-15 ug of membrane protein containing the human P 1,^2 or £3 adrenergic receptors in assay buffer (75 mM Tris/HCl pH 7.4 at 25°C, 12.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 0.2% BSA). Saturation binding studies for determination «f v<br>
-rodioligand were done using [3H]-dihydroalprenolol (NET-720,100 Ci/mmol, PerkinElrner Life Sciences Inc., Boston, MA) for the pi and £2 receptors and [l25I]-(-)-iodocyanopindolol (NEX-189,220 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences Inc., Boston, MA) at 10 or 11 different concentrations ranging from 0.01 nM to 20 nM. Displacement assays for determination of K/ values of test compounds were done with [3H]-dihydroalprenolol at 1 nM and [125I]-(-)-iodocyanopindolol at 0.5 nM for 10 or 11 different concentrations of test compound ranging from 10 pM to 10 |jM. Non-specific binding was determined in the presence of 10 \jM propranolol. Assays were incubated for 1 hour at 37°C, and then binding reactions were terminated by rapid filtration over GF/B for the pi and p2 receptors or GF/C glass fiber filter plates for the Pa receptors (Packard BioScience Co., Meriden, CT) presoaked in 0.3% polyethyleneimine. Filter plates were washed three times with filtration buffer (75 mM Tris/HCl pH 7.4 at 4°C, 12.5 mM MgCl2,1 mM EDTA) to remove unbound radioactivity. The plates were then dried and 50 uL of Microscint-20 liquid scintillation fluid (Packard BioScience Co., Meriden, CT) was added and plates were counted in a Packard Topcount liquid scintillation counter (Packard BioScience Co., Meriden, CT). Binding data were analyzed by nonlinear regression analysis with the GraphPad Prism Software package (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA) using the 3-parameter model for one-site competition. The curve minimum was fixed to the value for nonspecific binding, as determined in the presence of 10 uM propranolol. K,- values for test compounds were calculated from observed ICso values and the Kj value of the radioligand using the Cheng-Prusoff equation (Cheng Y, and Prusoff WH., Biochemical Pharmacology, 1973,22, 23, 3099-108).<br>
In this assay, a lower K/ value indicates that a test compound has a higher binding affinity for the receptor tested. Exemplified compound of this invention that were tested in this assay typically were found to have a K, value of less than about 300 nM for the Pa adrenergic receptor. For example, the compounds of Examples 3 and 6 were found to have Kj values of less than 10 nM.<br>
If desired, the receptor subtype selectivity for a test compound can be calculated as the ratio of K;(pi)/Kj(p2) or Ki(p3)/KLj(p2). Typically, compounds of this invention demonstrated greater binding at the p2 adrenergic receptor compared to the pi or Pa adrenergic receptor, i.e. K,-(PO or Kf(p3) is typically greater than K,-(p2). Generally, compounds having selectivity for the Pa adrenergic receptor over the Pi or Pa adrenergic<br>
receptors are preferred; especially compounds having a selectivity greater than about 5; and in particular, greater than about 8. By way of example, the compounds of Examples J3 and 6 had a ratio of KiOi)/Kj(p2) greater than 8.<br>
Assay Test Procedure B<br>
Radioligand Binding Assay for Muscarinic Receptors<br>
Radioligand binding assays for cloned human muscarinic receptors were performed in 96-well microtiter plates in a total assay volume of 100 fiL. CHO cell membranes stably expressing either the hMi, hMa, hMa, hMt or hMs muscarinic subtype were diluted in assay buffer to the following specific target protein concentrations (fig/well): 10 ug for hMt) 10-15 jig for hM2,10-20 ug for hM3,10-20 fag for hM*, and 10-12 ug for hM5 to get similar signals (cpm). The membranes were briefly homogenized using a Polytron tissue disruptor (10 seconds) prior to assay plate addition. Saturation binding studies for determining Kp values of the radioligand were performed using L-[W-methyl-•Iffjscopolamine methyl chloride ([3H]-NMS) (TRK666, 84.0 Ci/mmol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Buckinghamshire, England) at concentrations ranging from 0.001 nM to 20 nM. Displacement assays for determination of K/ values of test compounds were performed with [3H]-NMS at 1 nM and eleven different test compound concentrations. The test compounds were initially dissolved to a concentration of 400 uM in dilution buffer and then serially diluted 5x with dilution buffer to final concentrations ranging from 10 pM to 100 uM. The addition order and volumes to the assay plates were as follows: 25 uL radioligand, 25 uL diluted test compound, and 50 uL membranes. Assay plates were incubated for 60 minutes at 37°C. Binding reactions were terminated by rapid filtration over GF/B glass fiber filter plates (PerkinElmer Inc., Wellesley, MA) pre-treated in 1% BSA. Filter plates were rinsed three times with wash buffer (10 mM HEPES) to remove unbound radioactivity. The plates were then air dried and 50 uL Microscint-20 liquid scintillation fluid (PerkinElmer Inc., Wellesley, MA) was added to each well. The plates were then counted in a PerkinElmer Topcount liquid scintillation counter (PerkinElmer Inc., Wellesley,, MA). Binding data were analyzed by nonlinear regression analysis with the GraphPad Prism Software package (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA) using the one-site competition model. K, values for test compounds were calculated from observed ICso values and the K/&gt; value of the radioligand using the Cheng-Prusoff equation<br>
Cheng Y; Prusoff WH. (1973) Biochemical Pharmacology, 22(23):3099-108). K,-values were converted to pKj values to determine the geometric mean and 95% confidence intervals. These summary statistics were then converted back to Kj values for data reporting.<br>
In this assay, a lower K/ value indicates that the test compound has a higher binding affinity for the receptor tested. Exemplified compound of this invention that were tested in this assay typically were found to have a K/ value of less than about 300 nM for the Ms muscarinic receptor. For example, the compounds of Examples 3 and 6 were found to have K; values of less than 10 nM.<br>
Assay Test Procedure C<br>
Whole-cell cAMP Flashplate Assay in CHO Cell Lines Heterologously Expressing<br>

cAMP assays were performed in a radioimmunoassay format using the Flashplate Adenylyl Cyclase Activation Assay System with [ I25I]-cAMP (NEN SMP004, PerkinElmer Life Sciences Inc., Boston, MA), according to the manufacturers instructions. For the determination of |3 receptor agonist potency (ECso), CHO-K1 cell lines stably expressing cloned human Pi, Pa or ps adrenergic receptors were grown to near confluency in HAM's F-12 media supplemented with 10% FBS and Geneticin (250 ng/mL). Cells were rinsed with PBS and detached in dPBS (Dulbecco's Phosphate Buffered Saline, without CaCband MgCl2) containing 2 mM EDTA or Trypsin-EDTA solution (0.05% trypsin/0.53 mM EDTA). After counting cells in Coulter cell counter, cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 1,000 rpm and re-suspended in stimulation buffer containing IBMX (PerkinElmer Kit) pre-warmed to room temperature to a concentration of 1.6 x 106 to 2.8 x 106 cells/mL. About 60,000 to 80,000 cells per well were used in this assay. Test compounds (10 mM in DMSO) were diluted into PBS containing 0.1% BSA in Beckman Biomek-2000 and tested at 11 different concentrations ranging from 100 uM to 1 pM. Reactions were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C and stopped by adding 100 uL of cold detection buffer containing [I25I]-cAMP (NEN SMP004, PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA). The amount of cAMP produced (pmol/well) was calculated based on the counts observed for the samples and cAMP standards as described in the manufacturer's user manual. Data were analyzed by nonlinear regression analysis with the GraphPad Prism Software package (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA) with the sigmoidal<br>
equation. The Cheng-Prusoff equation (Cheng Y, and Prusoff WH., Biochemical Pharmacology, 1973, 22, 23, 3099-108) was used to calculate the EC50 values.<br>
In this assay, a lower EC50 value indicates that the test compound has a higher functional activity at the receptor tested. Exemplified compound of this invention that were tested in this assay typically were found to have aECso value of less than about 300 nM for the P2 adrenergic receptor. For example, the compounds of Examples 3 and 6 were found to have ECso values of less than 10 nM.<br>
If desired, the receptor subtype selectivity for a test compound can be calculated as the ratio of EC50(p iVECso(p2) or EC5o(p3)/EC50(p2). Typically, compounds of this invention demonstrated greater functional activity at the $2 adrenergic receptor compared . to the pi or ps adrenergic receptor, i.e. ECsoCPi) or ECsoCps) is typically greater than ECso(p2)- Generally, compounds having selectivity for the P2 adrenergic receptor over the pi or Pa adrenergic receptors are preferred; especially compounds having a selectivity greater than about 5; and in particular, greater than about 10. By way of example, the compounds of Examples 3 and 6 had ratios of ECsoCPO/ECsoCPz) greater than 10.<br>
Assay Test Procedure D<br>
Functional Assays of Antagonism for Muscarinic Receptor Subtypes<br>
A.       Blockade of Agonist-Mediated Inhibition of cAMP Accumulation<br>
In this assay, the functional potency of a test compound is determined by measuring the ability of the test compound to block oxotremorine-inhibition of forskolin-mediated cAMP accumulation in CHO-K1 cells expressing the hM2 receptor. cAMP assays are performed in a radioimmunoassay format using the Flashplate Adenylyl Cyclase Activation Assay System with I25I-cAMP (NEN SMP004B, PerkinElmer Life Sciences Inc., Boston, MA), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells are rinsed once with dPBS and lifted with Trypsin-EDTA solution (0.05% trypsin/0.53 mM EDTA) as described in the Cell Culture and Membrane Preparation section above. The detached cellfc are washed twice by centrifugation at 650 x g for five minutes in 50 mL dPBS. The cell pellet is then re-suspended in 10 mL dPBS, and the cells are counted with a Coulter Zl Dual Particle Counter (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA). The cells are centrifuged again at 650 x g for five minutes and re-suspended in stimulation buffer to an assay concentration of 1.6 x 106 - 2.8 x 106 cells/mL.<br>
The test compound is initially dissolved to a concentration of 400 {J.M in dilution buffer (dPBS supplemented with 1 mg/mL BSA (0.1%)), and then serially diluted with dilution buffer to final molar concentrations ranging from 100 uM to 0.1 nM. Oxotremorine is diluted in a similar manner.<br>
To measure oxotremorine inhibition of adenylyl cyclase (AC) activity, 25 uL forskolin (25 pM final concentration diluted in dPBS), 25 uL diluted oxotremorine, and 50 fjL cells are added to agonist assay wells. To measure the ability of a test compound to block oxotremorine-inhibited AC activity, 25 uL forskolin and oxotremorine (25 ^M and 5 uM final concentrations, respectively, diluted in dPBS), 25 uL diluted test compound, and 50 uL cells are added to remaining assay wells.<br>
Reactions are incubated for 10 minutes at 37 °C and stopped by addition of 100 uli ice-cold detection buffer. Plates are sealed, incubated overnight at room temperature and counted the next morning on a PerkinEhner TopCount liquid scintillation counter (PerkinElmer Inc., Wellesley, MA). The amount of cAMP produced (pmol/well) is calculated based on the counts observed for the samples and cAMP standards, as described in the manufacturer's user manual. Data is analyzed by nonlinear regression analysis with the GraphPad Prism Software package (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA) using the non-linear regression, one-site competition equation. The Cheng-Prusoff equation is used to calculate the K;, using the ECso of the oxotremorine concentration-response curve and the oxotremorine assay concentration as the kd and [L], respectively.<br>
In this assay, a lower K; value indicates that the test compound has a higher functional activity at the receptor tested. Exemplified compound of this invention that were tested in this assay typically were found to have a K,- value of less than about 300 nM for blockade of oxotremorine-inhibition of forskolin-mediated cAMP accumulation in CHO-Kl cells expressing the hMi receptor. For example, the compound of Example 3 was found to have a K{ value of less than 10 nM.<br>
B.       Blockade of Agonist-Mediated [35S]GTPyS Binding<br>
In a second functional assay, the functional potency of test compounds can be determined by measuring the ability of the compounds to block oxotremorine-stimulated [3sS]GTPyS_binding in CHO-Kl cells expressing the hM2 receptor.<br>
At the time of use, frozen membranes were thawed and then diluted in assay buffer<br>
a final target tissue concentration of 5-10 jj,g protein per well. The membranes were briefly homogenized using a Polytron PT-2100 tissue disrupter and then added to the assay plates.<br>
The ECgo value (effective concentration for 90% maximal response) for stimulation of [35S]GTPyS binding by the agonist oxotremorine was determined in each experiment.<br>
To determine the ability of a test compound to inhibit oxotremorine-stimulated [35S]GTPvS binding, the following was added to each well of 96 well plates: 25 uL of assay buffer with [35S]GTPyS (0.4nM), 25 \\L of oxotremorine(EC90) and GDP (3uM), 25 uL of diluted test compound and 25 uL CHO cell membranes expressing the hlVb receptor. The assay plates were then incubated at 37 °C for 60 minutes. The assay plates were filtered over 1% BSA-pretreated GF/B filters using a PerkinElmer 96-well harvester. The plates were rinsed with ice-cold wash buffer for 3 x 3 seconds and then air or vacuum dried. Microscint-20 scintillation liquid (50 fiL) was added to each well, and each plate was sealed and radioactivity counted on a Topcounter (PerkinElmer). Data were analyzed by nonlinear regression analysis with the GraphPad Prism Software package (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA) using the non-linear regression, one-site competition equation. The Cheng-Prusoff equation was used to calculate the K,-, using the ICso values of the concentration-response curve for the test compound and the oxotremorine concentration in the assay as the kd and [L], ligand concentration, respectively.<br>
In this assay, a lower Kj value indicates that the test compound has a higher functional activity at the receptor tested. Exemplified compound of this invention that were tested in this assay typically were found to have a K; value of less than about 300 nM for blockade of oxotremorine-stimulated [35S]GTPyS_binding in CHO-K1 cells expressing the hMa receptor. For example, the compound of Example 3 was found to have a Kj value of less than 10 nM.<br>
C.       Blockade of Agonist-Mediated Calcium Release via FLIPR Assays Muscarinic receptor subtypes (Mj, Ma and ms receptors), which couple to Gq proteins, activate the phospholipase C (PLC) pathway upon agonist binding to the receptor. As a result, activated PLC hydrolyzes phosphatyl inositol diphosphate (PIPi) to diacylglycerol (DAG) and phosphatidyl-l,4,5-triphosphate (IPa), which in turn generates calcium release from intracellular stores, i.e., endoplasmic and sarcoplasmic reticulum.<br>
^jhe FLIPR (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) assay capitalizes on this increase in intracellular calcium by using a calcium sensitive dye (Fluo-4AM, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) that fluoresces when free calcium binds. This fluorescence event is measured in real time by the FLIPR, which detects the change in fluorescence from a monolayer of cells cloned with human mi and ms, and chimpanzee ms receptors. Antagonist potency can be determined by the ability of antagonists to inhibit agonist-mediated increases in intracellular calcium.<br>
For FLIPR calcium stimulation assays, CHO cells stably expressing the hMi, hMa and cMs receptors are seeded into 96-well FLIPR plates the night before the assay is done. Seeded cells are washed twice by Cellwash (MTX Labsystems, Inc.) with FLIPR buffer (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 2 mM calcium chloride, 2.5 mM probenecid in Hank's Buffered Salt Solution (HBSS) without calcium and magnesium) to remove growth media and leaving 50 |aL/well of FLIPR buffer. The cells are then incubated with 50 (aL/well of 4 ^M FLUO-4AM (a 2X solution was made) for 40 minutes at 37 °C, 5% carbon dioxide. Following the dye incubation period, cells are washed two times with FLIPR buffer, leaving a final volume of 50 nL/well.<br>
To determine antagonist potency, the dose-dependent stimulation of intracellular Ca2+ release for oxotremorine is first determined so that antagonist potency can later be measured against oxotremorine stimulation at an EC9Q concentration. Cells are first incubated with compound dilution buffer for 20 minutes, followed by agonist addition, which is performed by the FLIPR. An ECgo value for oxotremorine is generated according to the method detailed in the FLIPR measurement and data reduction section below, in conjunction with the formula ECF = ((F/l 00-F)A 1 /H) * EC50. An oxotremorine concentration of 3 x ECp is prepared in stimulation plates such that an ECw concentration of oxotremorine is added to each well in the antagonist inhibition assay plates.<br>
The parameters used for the FLIPR are: exposure length of 0.4 seconds, laser strength of 0.5 watts, excitation wavelength of 488 nm, and emission wavelength of 550 nm. Baseline is determined by measuring the change in fluorescence for 10 seconds prior to addition of agonist. Following agonist stimulation, the FLIPR continuously measured the change of fluorescence every 0.5 to 1 second for 1.5 minutes to capture the maximum fluorescence change.<br>
The change of fluorescence is expressed as maximum fluorescence minus baseline fluorescence for each well. The raw data is analyzed against the logarithm of drug<br>
&gt;ncentration by nonlinear regression with GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA) using the built-in model for sigmoidal dose-response. Antagonist Kj values are determined by Prism using the oxotremorine EC50 value as the K/&gt; and the oxotremorine EC9o for the ligand concentration according to the Cheng-Prusoff equation (Cheng &amp; Prusoff, 1973).<br>
In this assay, a lower Kj value indicates that the test compound has a higher functional activity at the receptor tested. Exemplified compound of this invention that were tested in this assay typically were found to have a Kj value of less than about 300 nM for blockade of agonist-mediated calcium release in CHO cells stably expressing the hMi, hMs and cMs receptors. For example, the compound of Example 3 was found to have a Kj value of less than 10 nM for the hMi, hMs and cMs receptors.<br>
Assay Test Procedure E<br>
Whole-cell cAMP Flashplate Assay With a Lung Epithelial Cell Line Endogenously<br>
Expressing Human (Jj Adrenergic Receptor<br>
For the determination of agonist potencies and efficacies (intrinsic activities) in a cell line expressing endogenous levels of the fa adrenergic receptor, a human lung epithelial cell line (BEAS-2B) was used (ATCC CRL-9609, American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) (January B, et al., British Journal ofPJiarmacology, 1998,123, 4,701-11). Cells were grown to 75-90% confluency in complete, serum-free medium (LHC-9 MEDIUM containing Epinephrine and Retinoic Acid, cat # 181 -500, Biosource International, Camarillo, CA). The day before the assay, medium was switched to LHC-8 (no epinephrine or retinoic acid, cat # 141-500, Biosource International, Camarillo, CA). cAMP assays were performed in a radioimmunoassay format using the Flashplate Adenylyl Cyclase Activation Assay System with ['25I]-cAMP (NEN SMP004, PerkinElmer Life Sciences Inc., Boston, MA), according to the manufacturers instructions. On the day of the assay, cells were rinsed with PBS, lifted by scraping with 5mM EDTA in PBS, and counted. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 1,000 rpm and re-suspended in stimulation buffer pre-warmed to 37 °C at a final concentration of 600,000 cells/mL. Cells were used at a final concentration of 100,000 to 120,000 cells/well hi this assay. Test compounds were serially diluted into assay buffer (75 mM Tris/HCl pH 7.4 at 25°C, 12.5 mM MgCl2,1 mM EDTA, 0.2% BSA) in Beckman Biomek-2000. Test compounds were tested in the assay at 11 different concentrations, ranging from 10 uM to 10 pM. Reactions<br>
were incubated for 10 rnin at 37 °C and stopped by addition of 100 jiL of ice-cold detection buffer. Plates were sealed, incubated over night at 4 °C and counted the next morning in a Topcount scintillation counter (Packard BioScience Co., Meriden, CT). The amount of cAMP produced per mL of reaction was calculated based on the counts observed for samples and cAMP standards, as described in the manufacturer's user manual. Data were analyzed by nonlinear regression analysis with the GraphPad Prism Software package (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA) using the 4-parameter model for sigmoidal dose-response.<br>
In this assay, a lower ECso value indicates that the test compound has a higher functional activity at the receptor tested. Exemplified compound of this invention that were tested in this assay typically were found to have a ECso value of less than about 300 nM for the fa adrenergic receptor. For example, the compounds of Examples 3 and 6 were found to have ECso values of less than 10 nM.<br>
If desired, test compound efficacy (%Eff) was calculated from the ratio of the observed Emax (TOP of the fitted curve) and the maximal response obtained for isoproterenol dose response curve and was expressed as %Eff relative to isoproterenol. Exemplified compounds of this invention tested in this assay typically demonstrated a %Eff greater than about 40.<br>
Assay Test Procedure F<br>
Duration of Bronchoprotection In Guinea Pig Models of Acetylcholine-Induced or<br>
Histamine-Induced Bronchoconstriction<br>
These in vivo assays were used to assess the bronchoprotective effects of test compounds exhibiting both muscarinic receptor antagonist and 02 adrenergic receptor agonist activity. To isolate muscarinic antagonist activity in the acetylcholine-induced bronchoconstriction model, the animals were administered propanolol, a compound that blocks |3 receptor activity, prior to the administration of acetylcholine. Duration of bronchoprotection in the histamine-induced bronchoconstriction model reflects Pa adrenergic receptor agonist activity.<br>
Groups of 6 male guinea pigs (Duncan-Hartley (HsdPoc:DH) Harlan, Madison, WI) weighing between 250 and 350 g were individually identified by cage cards. Throughout the study, animals were allowed access to food and water ad libitum.<br>
Test compounds were administered via inhalation over 10 minutes in a whole-body exposure dosing chamber (R&amp;S Molds, San Carlos, CA). The dosing chambers were arranged so that an aerosol was simultaneously delivered to 6 individual chambers from a central manifold. Guinea pigs were exposed to an aerosol of a test compound or vehicle (WFI). These aerosols were generated from aqueous solutions using an LC Star Nebulizer Set (Model 22F51, PARI Respiratory Equipment, Inc. Midlothian, VA) driven by a mixture of gases (CO2 = 5%, O2 = 21 % and N2 = 74%) at a pressure of 22 psi. The gas flow through the nebulizer at this operating pressure was approximately 3 L/ minute. The generated aerosols were driven into the chambers by positive pressure. No dilution air was used during the delivery of aerosolized solutions. During the 10 minute nebulization, approximately 1.8 mL of solution was nebulized. This value was measured gravimetricalty by comparing pre-and post-nebulization weights of the filled nebulizer.<br>
The bronchoprotective effects of test compounds administered via inhalation were evaluated using whole body plethysmography at 1.5,24,48 and 72 hours post-dose.<br>
Forty-five minutes prior to the start of the pulmonary evaluation, each guinea pig was anesthetized with an intramuscular injection of ketamine (43.75 mg/kg), xylazine (3.50 mg/kg) and acepromazine (1.05 mg/kg). After the surgical site was shaved and cleaned with 70% alcohol, a 2-3 cm midline incision of the ventral aspect of the neck was made. Then, the jugular vein was isolated and cannulated with a saline-filled polyethylene catheter (PE-50, Becton Dickinson, Sparks, MD) to allow for intravenous infusions of acetylcholine (Ach) or histamine in saline. The trachea was then dissected free and cannulated with a 14G teflon tube (#NE- 014, Small Parts, Miami Lakes, FL). If required, anesthesia was maintained by additional intramuscular injections of the aforementioned anesthetic mixture. The depth of anesthesia was monitored and adjusted if the animal responds to pinching of its paw or if the respiration rate was greater than 100 breaths/minute.<br>
Once the cannulations were completed, the animal was placed into a plethysmograph (#PLY3114, Buxco Electronics, Inc., Sharon, CT) and an esophageal pressure cannula (PE-160, Becton Dickinson, Sparks, MD) was inserted to measure pulmonary driving pressure (pressure). The teflon trachea! tube was attached to the opening of the plethysmograph to allow the guinea pig to breathe room air from outside the chamber. The chamber was then sealed. A heating lamp was used to maintain body temperature and the guinea pig's lungs were inflated 3 times with 4 mL of air using a<br>
10 mL calibration syringe (#5520 Series, Hans Rudolph, Kansas City, MO) to ensure that the lower airways did not collapse and that the animal did not suffer from hyperventilation.<br>
Once it was determined that baseline values were within the range of 0.3 - 0.9 mL/cm H2O for compliance and within the range of 0.1 - 0.199 cm H2O/mL per second for resistance, the pulmonary evaluation was initiated. A Buxco pulmonary measurement computer progam enabled the collection and derivation of pulmonary values.<br>
Starting this program initiated the experimental protocol and data collection. The changes in volume over time that occur within the plethysmograph with each breath were measured via a Buxco pressure transducer. By integrating this signal over time, a measurement of flow was calculated for each breath. This signal, together with the pulmonary driving pressure changes, which were collected using a Sensym pressure transducer (#TRD4100), was connected via a Buxco (MAX 2270) preamplifier to a data collection interface (#'s SFT3400 and SFT3813). All other pulmonary parameters were derived from these two inputs.<br>
Baseline values were collected for 5 minutes, after which time the guinea pigs were challenged with Ach or histamine. When evaluating the muscarinic antagonist effects, propanolol (5 mg/Kg, iv) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) was administered 15 minutes prior to challenge with Ach. Ach (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) (0.1 mg/mL) was infused intravenously for 1 minute from a syringe pump (sp2IOiw, World Precision Instruments, Inc., Sarasota, FL) at the following doses and prescribed times from the start of the experiment: 1.9 ug/minute at 5 minutes, 3.8 ug/minute at 10 minutes., 7.5 fig/minute at 15 minutes, 15.0 ug/minute at 20 minutes, 30 )j.g/minute at 25 minutes and 60 ng/minute at 30 minutes. Alternatively, bronchoprotection of test compounds was assessed in the acetylcholine challenge model without pretreatment with a beta blocking compound.<br>
When evaluating the $2 adrenergic receptor agonist effects of test compounds, histamine (25 ng/mL) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) was infused intravenously for I minute from a syringe pump at the following doses and prescribed times from the start of the experiment: 0.5 jig/minute at 5 minutes, 0.9 fig/minute at 10 minutes, 1.9 ug/minute at 15 minutes, 3.8 p.g/minute at 20 minutes, 7.5 ug/minute at 25 minutes and 15 ug/minute at 30 minutes. If resistance or compliance had not returned to baseline values at 3 minutes following each Ach or histamine dose, the guinea pig's lungs were inflated 3 times with 4 mL of ah- from a 10 mL calibration syringe. Recorded pulmonary parameters include respiration frequency (breaths/minute), compliance (mL/cm HjO) and pulmonary<br>
Wsistance (cm HaO/ mL per second). Once the pulmonary function measurements were completed at minute 35 of this protocol, the guinea pig was removed from the plethysmograph and euthanized by carbon dioxide asphyxiation. The data were evaluated in one of two ways:<br>
(a)	Pulmonary resistance (rl, cm H2O/mL per second) was calculated from the<br>
ratio of "change in pressure" to "the change in flow." The RL response to ACh (60 ng/min,<br>
H) was computed for the vehicle and the test compound groups. The mean ACh response n vehicle-treated animals, at each pre-treatment time, was calculated and used to compute k inhibition of ACh response, at the corresponding pre-treatment time, at each test compound dose. Inhibition dose-response curves for 'RL' were fitted with a four tarameter logistic equation using GraphPad Prism, version 3.00 for Windows (GraphPad Software, San Diego, California) to estimate bronchoprotective IDso (dose required to nhibit the ACh (60 ug/min) bronchocontrictor response by 50%). The equation used was ,s follows:<br>
Y = Min + (Max-MinV(l + 10 «log ID5°-X)*Hillslope))<br>
/here X is the logarithm of dose, Y is the response (% Inhibition of ACh induced increase i rl). Y starts at Min and approaches asymptotically to Max with a sigmoida! shape.<br>
(b)	The quantity PD2, which is defined as the amount of Ach or histamine<br>
eeded to cause a doubling of the baseline pulmonary resistance, was calculated using the<br>
ulmonary resistance values derived from thej^ow and tint pressure over a range of Ach or<br>
istamine challenges using the following equation (derived from the equation used to<br>
alculate PCao values in the clinic (see Am. Thoracic Soc, 2000):<br>

Statistical analysis of the data was performed using a two tailed - Students t-test. A P-value 
Exemplified compounds of this invention that were tested in this assay typically produced a dose-dependent bronchoprotective effect against MCh-induced bronchoconstriction and His-induced bronchoconstriction. Generally, test compounds having a potency (IDso at 1.5 h post-dose) of less than about 300 }j,g/mL for ACh-induced bronchoconstriction and less than about 300 ug/mL for His-induced bronchoconstriction in this assay are generally preferred. For example, the compounds of Examples 3 and 6 were found to have an IDso less than about 100 ug/mL for ACh-induced bronchoconstriction and an IDso less than about 100 u,g/mL for His-induced bronchoconstriction at 1.5 hours post-dose.<br>
Additionally, test compounds having a duration (PD Ti/a) of brochoprotective activity of at least about 24 hours in this assay are generally preferred. By way of example, the compounds of Examples 3 and 6 were found to have a PD Tj/2 of at least about 24 hours post-dose.<br>
Assay Test Procedure G<br>
Einthoven Model for Measuring Changes in Ventilation in Guinea Pigs<br>
The bronchodilator activity of test compounds was evaluated in an anesthetized guinea pig model (the Einthoven model), which uses ventilation pressure as a surrogate measure of airway resistance. See, for example, Einthoven (1892) Pfilgers Arch. 51: 367 -&gt; 445; and Mohammed et al. (2000) Pulm Pharmacol Ther.73^:287-92. In this model, muscarinic antagonist and 02 agonist activity was assessed by determining the protective effects against methacholine (MCh) and histamine (His)-induced bronchoconstriction.<br>
This assay was conducted using Duncan-Hartley guinea pigs (Harlan, Indianapolis, IN), weighing between 300 and 400 g.<br>
The test compound or vehicle (i.e., sterile water) was dosed by inhalation (IH) over a 10 minute time period in a whole body exposure dosing chamber (R+S Molds, San Carlos, CA) using 5 mL of dosing solution. Animals were exposed to an aerosol, which<br>
was generated from an LC Star Nebulizer Set (Model 22F51, PARI Respiratory Equipment, Inc. Midlothian, VA) driven by Bioblend a mixture of gasses (5% CO2; 21% O2; and 74% N2) at a pressure of 22 psi. Pulmonary function was evaluated at various time-points after inhalation dosing.<br>
Forty five minutes prior to the start of pulmonary function evaluation, the guinea pigs were anesthetized with an intramuscular (IM) injection of a mixture of ketamine (13.7 mg/kg/xylazine (3.5 mg/kg)/acepromazine (1.05 mg/kg). A supplemental dose of this mixture (50% of initial dose) was administered as needed. The jugular vein and carotid artery were isolated and cannulated with saline-filled polyethylene catheters (micro-renathane and PE-50, respectively, Beckton Dickinson, Sparks, MD). The carotid artery was connected to a pressure transducer to allow the measurement of blood pressure and the jugular vein cannula was used for IV injection of either MCh or His. The trachea was then dissected free and cannulated with a 14G needle (#NE-014, Small Parts, Miami Lakes, FL). Once the cannulations were complete, the guinea pigs were ventilated using a respirator (Model 683, Harvard Apparatus, Inc., MA) set at a stroke volume of ImL/100 g body weight but not exceeding 2.5 mL volume, and at a rate of 100 strokes per minute. Ventilation pressure (VP) was measured in the tracheal cannula using a Biopac transducer that was connected to a Biopac (TSD 137C) pre-amplifier. Body temperature was maintained at 37 °C using a heating pad. Prior to initiating data collection, pentobarbital (25mg/kg) was administered intraperitoneally (IP) to suppress spontaneous breathing and obtain a stable baseline. The changes in VP were recorded on a Biopac Windows data collection interface. Baseline values were collected for at least 5 minutes, after which time guinea pigs were challenged IV non-cumulatively with 2-fold incremental doses of the bronchoconstrictor (MCh or His). When MCh was used as the bronchoconstrictor agent, animals were pre-treated with propranolol (5 mg/kg, IV) to isolate the antimuscarinic effects of the test compound. Changes in VP were recorded using the Acknowledge Data Collection Software (Santa Barbara, CA). After the completion of study, the animals were euthanized.<br>
Change in VP was measured in cm of water. Change in VP (cm H2O) = peak pressure (after bronchoconstrictor challenge) - peak baseline pressure. The dose-response curve to MCh or His was fitted to a four parameter logistic equation using GraphPad Prism, version 3.00 for Windows (GraphPad Software, San Diego, California) The equation used was as follows:<br>
(Max-Mm)/(l<br>
where X is the logarithm of dose, Y is the response. Y starts at Min and approaches asymptotically to Max with a sigmoidal shape.<br>
The percent inhibition of the bronchoconstrictor response to a submaximal dose of MCh or His was calculated at each dose of the test compound using the following equation: % Inhibition of response = 100-((peak pressure (after bronchoconstrictor challenge, treated) - peak baseline pressure (treated) * 100% / (peak pressure (after bronchoconstrictor challenge, water) - peak baseline pressure (water)). Inhibition curves were fitted using the four parameter logistic equation from GraphPad software. IDso (dose required to produce 50% inhibition of the bronchoconstrictor response) and Emax (maximal inhibition) were also estimated wherever appropriate.<br>
The magnitude of bronchoprotection at different time-points after inhalation of the test compound was used to estimate the pharmacodynamic half-life (PD ti/j). PD ti/i wag determined using a non-linear regression fit using a one-phase exponential decay equation (GraphPad Prism, Version 4.00): Y=Span*exp(-K*X) + Plateau; Starts at Span+Plateau and decays to Plateau with a rate constant K. The PD ti/z= 0.69/K. Plateau was constrained to 0.<br>
Exemplified compounds of this invention that were tested in this assay typically produced a dose-dependent bronchoprotective effect against MCh-induced bronchoconstriction and His-induced bronchoconstriction. Generally, test compounds having an IDso less than about 300 u.g/mL for MCh-induced bronchoconstriction and an IDso less than about 300 jag/mL for His-induced bronchoconstriction at 1.5 hours post-dose in this assay are preferred. Additionally, test compounds having a duration (PD ti/z) of brochoprotective activity of at least about 24 hours in this assay are generally preferred.<br>
Assay Test Procedure H<br>
Inhalation Guinea Pig Salivation Assay<br>
Guinea pigs (Charles River, Wilmington, MA) weighing 200-350 g were acclimated to the in-house guinea pig colony for at least 3 days following arrival. Test compound or vehicle were dosed via inhalation (IH) over a 10 minute time period in a pie shaped dosing chamber (R+S Molds, San Carlos, CA). Test solutions were dissolved in<br>
sterile water and delivered using a nebulizer filled with 5.0 mL of dosing solution. Guinea pigs were restrained in the inhalation chamber for 30 minutes. During this time, guinea pigs were restricted to an area of approximately 1 10 sq. cm. This space was adequate for the animals to turn freely, reposition themselves, and allow for grooming. Following 20 minutes of acclimation, guinea pigs were exposed to an aerosol generated from a LS Star Nebulizer Set (Model 22F51, PARI Respiratory Equipment, Inc. Midlothian, VA) driven by house air at a pressure of 22 psi. Upon completion of nebulization, guinea pigs were evaluated at 1 .5, 6, 12, 24, 48, or 72 hrs after treatment.<br>
Guinea pigs were anesthetized one hour before testing with an intramuscular (IM) injection of a mixture of ketamine 43.75 mg/kg, xylazine 3.5 mg/kg, and acepromazine 1 .05 mg/kg at an 0.88 mL/kg volume. Animals were placed ventral side up on a heated (37°C) blanket at a 20 degree incline with their head in a downward slope. A 4-ply 2x2 inch gauze pad (Nu-Gauze General -use sponges, Johnson and Johnson, Arlington, TX) was inserted in the guinea pig's mouth. Five minutes later, the muscarinic agonist pilocarpine (3.0 mg/kg, s.c.) was administered and the gauze pad was immediately discarded and replaced by a new pre- weighed gauze pad. Saliva was collected for 1 0 minutes, at which point the gauze pad was weighed and the difference in weight recorded to determine the amount of accumulated saliva (in mg). The mean amount of saliva collected for animals receiving the vehicle and each dose of test compound was calculated. The vehicle group mean was considered to be 100% salivation. Results were calculated using result means (n = 3 or greater). Confidence intervals (95%) were calculated for each dose at each time point using two-way ANOVA. This model is a modified version of the procedure described in Rechter, "Estimation of anticholinergic drug effects in mice by antagonism against pilocarpine-induced salivation" Ata Phaitnacol Toxicol, 1996, 24:243-254.<br>
The mean weight of saliva in vehicle-treated animals, at each pre-treatment time, was calculated and used to compute % inhibition of salivation, at the corresponding pre-treatment time, at each dose. The inhibition dose-response data were fitted to a a four parameter logistic equation using GraphPad Prism, version 3.00 for Windows (GraphPad Software, San Diego, California) to estimate anti-sialagogue IDso (dose required to inhibit 50% of pilocarpine-evoked salivation). The equation used was as follows:<br>
Y = Mm + (Max-Min)/(l + 10<br>
where X is the logarithm of dose, Y is the response (% inhibition of salivation). Y starts at Min and approaches asymptotically to Max with a sigmoidal shape.<br>
The ratio of the anti-sialagogue IDso to bronchoprotective IDso was used to compute the apparent lung-selectivity index of the test compound. Generally, compounds laving an apparent lung-selectivity index greater than about 5 are preferred. In this assay, he compound of Example 3 had an apparent lung-selectivity index greater than 5.<br>
