Description of the related art<br>
Immunotherapy or vaccination are attractive for the prophylaxis or therapy of a<br>
wide range of disorders, such as, for example, certain infectious diseases, or<br>
cancers. However, the application and success of such treatments are limited<br>
in part by the poor immunogenicity of the target antigen. Many peptides,<br>
glycopeptides, lipids, lipopeptides, carbohydrates etc., are poorly immunogenic.<br>
Several techniques are used to enhance the immune response of a subject to a<br>
peptide immunogen.<br>
It is known to utilize an adjuvant formulation that is extrinsic to the peptide<br>
immunogen (i.e. it is mixed with the immunogen prior to use), such as, for<br>
example, complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA), to enhance the immune response<br>
of a subject to a peptide immunogen. However, many of the adjuvants<br>
currently available are too toxic for use in humans, or simply ineffective.<br>
Moreover, adjuvants of this type require prior formulation with the peptide<br>
immunogen immediately before administration, such formulations often having<br>
a tow solubility or being insoluble.<br>
Lipopeptides, wherein a lipid moiety that is known to act as an adjuvant Is<br>
covalently coupled to a peptide immunogen, may be capable of enhancing the<br>
immunogenicity of an otherwise weakly immunogenic peptide in the absence of<br>
an extrinsic adjuvant [Jung et a/., Angew Chem, Int Ed Engl 10, 872, (1985);<br>
Martinon et a/., J Immunol 149, 3416, (1992); Toyokuni et a/., J Am Chem Soc<br>
116, 395, (1994); Deprez, ef a/., J Med Chem 38, 459, (1995); and Sauzet et<br>
a/., Vaccine 13, 1339, (1995); Benmohamed et al., Eur. J. Immunol. 27, 1242,<br>
(1997); Wiesmuller et a/., Vaccine 7, 29, (1989); Nardln et a/., Vaccine 16, 590,<br><br>
(1998); Benmohamed, et al. Vaccine 18, 2843, (2000); and Obert, et al.,<br>
Vaccine 16, 161, (1998)]. Suitable lipopeptides show none of the harmful side<br>
effects associated with adjuvant formulations, and both antibody and cellular<br>
responses have been observed against lipopeptides.<br>
Several different fatty acids are known for use in lipid moieties. Exemplary fatty<br>
acids include, but are not limited to, palmitoyl, myristoyl, stearoyl and decanoyl<br>
groups or, more generally, any C2 to C30 saturated, monounsaturated, or<br>
polyunsaturated fatty acyl group is thought to be useful.<br>
The lipoamino acid N-palmitoyl-S-[2,3-6/s(palmitoyloxy)propyl]cysteine, also<br>
known as Pam3Cys or Pam3Cys-OH (Wiesmuller et al., Z. Physiol.Chem. 364<br>
(1983), p593), is a synthetic version of the N-terminal moiety of Braun's<br>
lipoprotein that spans the inner and outer membranes of Gram negative<br>
bacteria. Pam3Cys has the structure of Formula (I):<br><br>
United States Patent No. 5, 700, 910 to Metzger et al (December 23, 1997)<br>
describes several N-acyl-S-(2-hydroxyalkyl)cysteines for use as intermediates<br>
in the preparation of lipopeptides that are used as synthetic adjuvants, B<br>
lymphocyte stimulants, macrophage stimulants, or synthetic vaccines. Metzger<br>
et al. also teach the use of such compounds as intermediates in the synthesis<br><br>
of Pam3Cys-OH (Wiesmuller ef a/., Z. Physiol.Chem. 364, p593, 1983), and of<br>
lipopeptides that comprise this lipoamino acid or an analog thereof at the N-<br>
termlnus.<br>
Par3Cys has been shown to be capable of stimulating virus-specific cytotoxic<br>
T lymphocyte (CTL) responses against influenza virus-infected cells (Deres ef<br>
a/., Nature 342, 561, 1989) and to elicit protective antibodies against foot-and-<br>
mouth disease (Wiesmuller ef a/., Vaccine 7, 29, 1989; United States Patent<br>
No. 6,024.964 to Jung ef a/., February 15, 2000) when coupled to the<br>
appropriate epitopes.<br>
Recently, Pam2Cys (also known as dipalmitoyl-S-glyceryl-cysteine or S-{2.3-<br>
bis(palmitoyloxy)propyl}cysteine, an analogue of Pam3Cys, has been<br>
synthesised (Metzger, J. W., A. G. Beck-Sickinger, M. Loleit, M. Eckert, W. G.<br>
Bessler, and G. Jung. 1995. J Pept Sci 1:184.) and been shown to correspond<br>
to the lipid moiety of MALP-2, a macrophage-activating lipopeptide isolated<br>
from mycoplasma (Sacht, G., A. Marten, U. Deiters, R. Sussmuth, G. Jung, E.<br>
Wingender. and P. F. Muhlradt. 1998. Eur J Immunol 28:4207: Muhlradt, P. F..<br>
M. Kiess, H. Meyer, R. Sussmuth. and G. Jung. 1998. Infect Immun 66:4804:<br>
Muhlradt. P. F.. M. Kiess, H. Meyer, R. Sussmuth, and G. Jung. 1997. J Exp<br>
Med 185:1951). Pam2Cys has the structure of Formula (II):<br><br><br>
Pam2Cys is reported to be a more potent stimulator of splenocytes and<br>
macrophages than Pam3Cys (Metzger et al., J Pept. Set 1,184,1995; Muhlradt<br>
et al., J Exp Med 185,1951,1997; and Muhlradt et a/., Infect Immun 66, 4804.<br>
1998).<br>
Generation of an antibody response against a given antigen requires the<br>
generation of a strong T helper cell response. Accordingly, it is desirable to<br>
administer an antigen in conjunction with at least one T-helper cell epitope<br>
(Vitiello et a/., J. Clin. Invest. 95, 341-349, 1995; Livingston et al., J. Immunol.<br>
159, 1383-1392, 1997). However, because T helper cell responses are<br>
provided by CD4* T-cells that recognize fragments of peptide antigens in<br>
context of MHC class II molecules on the surface of antigen presenting cells<br>
(APCs), most of the processed forms of peptide antigens are only presented by<br>
one or a few alleles of MHC haplotypes. This causes the T helper response to<br>
a given antigenic peptide to be strictly under genetic control of an individual.<br>
To avoid large genetic variation in the immune responses of a given population<br>
of individuals to an antigen, an antigen is administered in conjunction with a<br>
large protein having a range of T helper epitopes.<br>
Alternatively, promiscuous or permissive T-helper epitope-containing peptides<br>
are administered in conjunction with the antigen. Promiscuous or permissive T-<br>
helper epitope-containing peptides are presented in the context of a vast<br>
majority of MHC class II haplotypes, such that they Induce strong CD4* T<br>
helper responses in the majority of an outbred human population. Examples of<br>
promiscuous or permissive T-helper epitopes are tetanus toxoid peptide,<br>
Plasmodium falcipamm pfg27, lactate dehydrogenase, and HIVgp120<br>
(Contreas et al., Infect Immun, 66, 3579-3590, 1998; Gaudebout et a/., J.<br>
A.I.D.S. Human Retrovirol 14, 91-101, 1997; Kaumaya et al, J. Mol. Recog. 6,<br>
81-94, 1993; and Fern and Good J. Immunol. 148, 907-913, 1992). Ghosh ef<br><br>
a/., Immunol 104, 5&amp;-66, 2001 and International Patent Application No.<br>
PCT/AUOO/00070 (WO 00/46390) also describe T-helper epitopes from the<br>
fusion protein of Canine Distemper Virus (CDV-F). Certain promiscuous T-<br>
helper epitopes induce strong B cell responses to a given antigen, and can<br>
bypass certain haplotype restricted immune responses (Kaumaya et a/., J. Mol.<br>
Recog. 6, 81-94,1993).<br>
Routinely, a vaccine preparation will comprise a mixture of polypeptides<br>
comprising the T-helper cell epitope and antigenic epitope, however it is also<br>
known to administer a single polypeptide comprising both the T-helper epitope<br>
and the antigenic epitope (eg. Ghosh and Jackson, Int. Immunol. 11, 1103,<br>
1999).<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
In work leading up to the present invention, the inventors sought to produce<br>
highly immunogenic lipopeptides having a lipid moiety and a polypeptide moiety<br>
comprising both a T helper epitope and an antigenic B cell epitope against<br>
which an immune response is desired. The lipopeptides of the invention have<br>
the lipid moiety attached via the terminal side chain amino group of an internal<br>
lysine, or an internal lysine analog such as, for example, ornithine,<br>
diaminopropionic acid, or diaminobutyric acid, in the polypeptide moiety. This<br>
is distinct from the N-terminal attachments, or C-terminal attachments (Grass-<br>
Masse etal. Vaccine, 14,375,1996), described previously.<br>
Accordingly, by positioning said one or more lysine residues) or lysine analog<br>
residue(s) at predetermined locations within the polypeptide during peptide<br>
synthesis, the attachment site of the lipid is readily specified. Thus, the<br>
positioning of the lipid moiety in the lipopeptide Is targeted to enhance the utility<br>
of the end-product for vaccine or adjuvant formulations.<br><br>
Surprisingly, the inventors have found that attachment of the lipid moiety via the<br>
side-chain epsilon-amino group of an internal lysine residue or the terminal<br>
side-chain group of an internal lysine analog residue positioned between the<br>
amino acid sequences of the T helper epitope and the antigen, enhances the<br>
solubility of the lipopeptide product in many cases.<br>
One advantage provided by the lipopetides of the present invention is that they<br>
are sufficiently immunogenic such that it is generally not necessary to include<br>
an extrinsic adjuvant in vaccine formulations comprising these lipopeptides.<br>
The present invention clearly encompasses the attachment of a lipid moiety via<br>
the epsilon-amino group of an internal lysine residue or the terminal side-chain<br>
group of an internal lysine analog residue present in the amino acid sequence<br>
of the T helper epitope or the antigen, the only requirement being that the lipid<br>
moiety is not attached to the N-terminus or the C-terminus of the peptide. As<br>
exemplified herein, the inventors have clearly shown that, for example, the lipid<br>
may be attached to the epsilon amino group of an internal lysine residue within<br>
the T-helper epitope without loss of the ability of the subject lipopeptides in<br>
generating an immune response, compared to a lipopeptide wherein the lipid is<br>
added to the epsilon amino group of a lysine positioned between the T-helper<br>
epitope and the B-cell epitope.<br>
By "internal" means at a location other than the N-terminus or the C-terminus of<br>
a polypeptide comprising a T helper epitope and antigenic B cell epitope.<br>
Preferably, the lipid moiety is attached to the peptide moiety via the epsilon<br>
amino group of a lysine residue or the terminal side-chain group of an internal<br>
lysine analog residue positioned between the amino acid sequences of the T<br>
helper epitope and the antigenic B cell epitope<br><br>
As will be known to the skilled person, solubility of an antigen is highly<br>
desirable for producing vaccine formulations on a commercial basis. In this<br>
respect, the inventors have found that the most effective lipopeptides of the<br>
invention are highly soluble. The relative ability of the lipopeptides of the<br>
invention to induce an antibody response in the absence of external adjuvant<br>
was reflected by their ability to upregulate the surface expression of MHC class<br>
II molecules on immature dendritic cells (DC).<br>
As exemplified herein, the structure of the lipid moiety is not essential to activity<br>
of the resulting lipopeptide, as lipid moieties comprising palmitic acid, lauric<br>
acid, stearic acid or octanoic acid can be used without loss of immunogenicity.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention is not to be limited by the structure of the<br>
lipid moiety, unless specified otherwise, or the context requires otherwise.<br>
Similarly, the addition of multiple lipid moieties to the peptide moiety, although<br>
generally not required, is also encompassed by the invention, unless specified<br>
otherwise or the context requires otherwise. As exemplified herein, the addition<br>
of multiple lipid moieties to the peptide moiety, such as, for example, to a<br>
position within the T-heiper epitope, and to a position between the T-helper<br>
epitope and the B-cell epitope, does not adversely affect the ability of the<br>
lipopeptide to stimulate IgG production compared to a peptide having only a<br>
single lipid moiety attached.<br>
It will be apparent from the preceding that the polypeptide is synthesized<br>
conveniently as a single amino acid chain, thereby requiring no post-synthesis<br>
modification to incorporate both epitopes.<br>
Optionally, an amino acid spacer is added at either side of the internal lysine or<br>
lysine analog to which the lipid moiety is to be attached, such as, for example,<br>
between the T-helper and B-cell epitopes.<br><br>
As exemplified herein, the present inventors produced the lipopeptide of the<br>
invention by coupling the lipid moiety to an exposed epsilon-amino group of an<br>
internal lysine residue positioned between the T-helper and B-cell epitopes in<br>
the synthetic peptide moiety, with or without a spacer. Particularly preferred<br>
spacers in this context consist of serine dimers, trimers, teramers, etc.<br>
A spacer of any conventional type can also be added between the lipid moiety<br>
and the polypeptide moiety. Particularly preferred spacers in this context<br>
consist of arginine or serine dimers, trimers, teramers, etc. Alternatively, a 6-<br>
aminohexanoic acid spacer can be used.<br>
Alternative spacers are also contemplated. For example, a spacer may be<br>
added to the exposed epsilon amino group of an internal lysine or to the<br>
terminal side-chain group of an internal lysine analog before addition of the lipid<br>
moiety.<br>
Alternatively, a lipoamino acid of Formula (III) or (IV) may be added directly to<br>
the epsilon amino group of the internal lysine residue or to the terminal side-<br>
chain group of the internal lysine analog.<br>
Also exemplified herein, the lipopeptide of the present invention induces the<br>
production of a high titer antibody against the B cell epitope moiety when<br>
administered to an animal subject, without any requirement for an adjuvant to<br>
achieve a similar antibody titer. This utility is supported by the enhanced<br>
maturation of dendritic cells following administration of the subject lipopeptides<br>
(i.e. enhanced antigen presentation compared to lipopeptides having N-<br>
terminally coupled lipid).<br><br>
Also exemplified herein, a lipopeptide of the present invention comprising an<br>
antigenic B cell epitope of LHRH is capable of inducing infertility in a mouse<br>
model representative of other mammals in which infertility is to be induced. The<br>
sustained production of antibodies against LHRH achieved by the lipopeptides<br>
of the invention demonstrates the general utility of the subject lipopeptides in<br>
inducing humoral immunity and as an active agent in a vaccine preparation.<br>
Also exemplified herein, a lipopeptide of the present invention comprising an<br>
antigenic B cell epitope of the M protein of Group A Streptococcus (herein<br>
"GAS") is capable of inducing protection in a mouse model representative of<br>
humans and other mammals in which vaccination against GAS is indicated.<br>
The data provided herein indicate that the lipopeptides of the present invention<br>
are capable of inducing a sustained production of antibodies against GAS (both<br>
serum IgG, and salivary and faecal IgA), and the opsonization of GAS, and the<br>
survival of animals against a subsequent GAS challenge. These data<br>
demonstrate the general utility of the subject lipopeptides in inducing humoral<br>
immunity and as an active agent in a vaccine preparation against GAS.<br>
Also exemplified herein, a lipopeptide of the present invention comprising an<br>
antigenic B cell epitope of gastrin ("pentagastrin") is capable of inducing the<br>
sustained production of antibodies against gastrin and/or cholecystekinin in a<br>
mouse model of other mammals in which inhibition of gastric acid secretion is<br>
indicated. The data provided herein demonstrate the general utility of the<br>
subject lipopeptides in inducing humoral immunity against gastrin and<br>
immunoneutralization of gastrin, to thereby block secretion of gastric acid, in an<br>
animal suffering from hypergastrinemia, Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, gastric<br>
ulceration or duodenal ulceration due to excessive and unregulated secretion of<br>
gastric acid, or to reduce or prevent the formation of gastrin-dependent tumours<br>
in the pancreas or duodenum (i.e. the prophylaxis and/or therapy of<br>
gastrinoma).<br><br>
As will be clear to those skilled in the art, the nature of the T-helper and B cell<br>
epitopes is not critical in the context of the present invention. The novel<br>
approach of attaching the lipid moiety to the epsilon amino group of one or<br>
more internal lysine residues or lysine analogue residues within the polypeptide<br>
portion of the construct has broad application. Accordingly, based on the<br>
results presented herein, it will be understood that a wide range of T-helper and<br>
B cell epitopes can be used in the lipopeptide constructs.<br>
In fact, the broad range of applications exemplified herein indicate the<br>
generality of the lipopeptides of the present invention in the prophylaxis and<br>
therapy of a number of different conditions in humans and other mammals in<br>
which the generation of an immune response against an antigenic B cell<br>
epitope is indicated. Accordingly, the present invention is not to be limited to<br>
the treatment of any specific condition, ailment or disease state.<br>

Brief description of the accompanying drawings:<br>
Figure 1 is a representation of the structures of synthetic peptides and<br>
lipopeptides (left) and the relative solubilities of a sample of those peptides and<br>
lipopeptides in saline solution (right). Peptides were designated as follows:<br>
(i) [Th] consisting of a CD4* T-helper epitope from the light chain of<br>
influenza virus haemagglutinin (SEQ ID NO: 1) or peptide P25 from<br>
CDV-F (SEQ ID NO: 24);<br>

"pentagastrin"; SEQ ID NO: 102);<br>
(Hi) [Th]-[B] consisting of a polypeptide having (i) and (ii) (e.g., SEQ ID NOs:<br>
5,103,104,105,107,109 or 111); and<br>

lysine residue (e.g., SEQ ID NOs: 7, 9,13,106,108,110, or 112).<br>
Lipopeptides were designated as follows:<br>
(i) Pam3Cys-[Th-[B] consisting of a lipid of the Formula (I) conjugated to<br>
the N-terminus of peptide |Th]-[B] supra (i.e. to the N-terminus of, for<br>
example, any one of SEQ ID NOs: 5,103,104,105, 107,109 or 111);<br>
(ii) Pam3Cys-Ser-Ser-[Th]-[B] consisting of a lipoamino acid of the Formula<br>
(III) conjugated to the N-terminus of peptide [Th]-[B] supra (i.e. to the N-<br>
terminus of, for example, any one of SEQ ID NOs: 5, 103,104, 105, 107,<br>
109 or 111);<br>
(iii) Pam2Cys-[Th]-|B] consisting of a lipid of the Formula (II) conjugated to<br>
the N-terminus of peptide [Th]-[B] supra (i.e. to the N-terminus of, for<br>
example, any one of SEQ ID NOs: 5,103,104,105,107,109 or 111);<br>
(iv) Pam2Cys-Ser-Ser-[Th]-[B] consisting of a lipid of the Formula (IV)<br>
conjugated to the N-terminus of peptide [Th]-[B] supra (i.e. to the N-<br>
terminus of, for example, any one of SEQ ID NOs: 5,103,104,105,107,<br>
109 or 111);<br>
(v)[Th]-Lys(Pam3Cys)-[B] consisting of peptide [Th]-Lys-[B] (e.g., any one<br>
of SEQ ID NOs: 7, 9, 13, 106, 108, 110, or 112) and a lipid of the<br>
Formula (I) conjugated to the epsilon-amino group of the internal lysine<br>
(Lys) of said peptide;<br><br>
(vi) [Th]-Lys(Pam2Cys)-[B] consisting of peptide [Th]-Lys-[B] (e.g., any one<br>

serially via the epsilon amino group of the internal lysine (Lys) to a<br>
serine homodimer (i.e. Ser-Ser) and then a lipid of the Formula (II).<br>
Thus, to produce this branched lipopeptide, the two serine residues were<br>
added to the epsilon-amino group of the lysine residue before the lipid<br>
moiety was attached.<br>
Relative solubility of the peptides and lipopeptides based upon the influenza<br>
virus haemagglutinin T-helper epitope (SEQ ID NO: 1) and the LHRH 1-10 B-<br>
cell epitope (SEQ ID NO: 2) is indicated at the right of the figure, ranging from<br>
low solubility (-) to high solubility (++++).<br>
Figure 2 is a photographic representation showing the solubilities of<br>
lipopeptides designated [Th]-Lys(Pam2Cys-Ser-Ser)-[B] (left) and Pam2Cys-<br>
Ser-Ser-[Th]-[B] (right) in Figure 1, wherein the polypeptide moieties have the<br>
amino acid sequences set forth in SEQ ID NO: 7 and SEQ ID NO: 5,<br>
respectively. Both solutions are approximately 1 mg/ml lipopeptide in saline<br>
solution. The enhanced clarity of the solution comprising lipopeptide [Th]-<br>
Lys(Pam2Cys-Ser-Ser)-[B] is indicative of its higher solubility compared to<br>
lipopeptide Pam2Cys-Ser-Ser-|Th]-[B].<br>
Figure 3 is a graphical representation showing the anti-LHRH antibody titers<br>
obtained using each of the peptides and lipopeptides shown in Figure 1,<br>
wherein the polypeptide moieties have the amino acid sequences set forth in<br><br>
SEQ ID NO: 5 or SEQ ID NO: 7. A negative control lipopeptide designated<br>
Pam3Cys-Ser-Lys4 consisted of the lipid of Formula (I) conjugated to the N-<br>
terminus of a peptide having the amino acid sequence Ser-Lys-Lys-Lys-Lys<br>
(SEQ ID NO: 17). All peptides and lipopeptides were administered sub-<br>
cutaneously (s.c.) in saline for both primary inoculation (open circles) and<br>
secondary inoculations (closed circles). The two non-lipidated peptides [Th]-<br>
Lys-[B] and [Th]-[B] were administered in complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) for<br>
the primary inoculations, and in incomplete Freund's adjuvant (IFA) for the<br>
secondary inoculations. For administration of the peptide [Th]-[B] in<br>
combination with the lipopeptide Pam3Cys-S-Lys4, peptide was dissolved in<br>
saline and mixed with the lipopeptide in 1:1 or 1:5 molar ratio as indicated. The<br>
dose of peptide and lipopeptide immunogens administered was 20 nmole. In all<br>
cases, control groups of animals received saline emulsified in CFA for priming<br>
and saline emulsified in IFA for the secondary inoculation.<br>
Figure 4 is a graphical representation showing anti-LHRH antibody titers (log10)<br>
on the ordinate for each anti-LHRH antibody isotype (i.e. IgM, IgA, lgG1,<br>
lgG2a, lgG2b, lgG3, and total Ig) (abscissa) obtained or elicited during<br>
secondary antibody responses following inoculation with the lipopeptide [Th]-<br>
Lys(Pam2Cys-Ser-Ser)-[B] (SEQ ID NO: 7). Mice were bled 2 weeks after<br>
receiving the second dose of the lipopeptide vaccine administered in saline<br>
either subcutaneously (open squares) or intranasally (closed squares) in saline.<br>
Figure 5 is a graphical representation showing the relative abilities of peptides<br>
and lipopeptides shown in Figure 1 (i.e. SEQ ID NO: 5 or SEQ ID NO: 7) to<br>
enhance the expression of MHC class II molecules on the surface of dendritic<br>
cells. Peptides and lipopeptides are indicated in each panel according to the<br>
nomenclature of Figure 1. For each peptide or lipopeptide , 8x104 D1 cells<br>
were exposed to 4.5 fmole of peptide or lipopeptide and incubated overnight.<br><br>
The cells were collected and the MHC class II molecules expression was<br>
determined by flow cytometry after staining with FITC-conjugated anti-l-Ek,d<br>
monoclonal antibody. About 3x104 D1 cells were analyzed for each sample.<br>
Data shown are for a representative of four independent experiments, and<br>
indicate enhanced staining with monoclonal antibody (i.e. enhanced D1 cell<br>
maturation) following administration of lipopeptides, particularly lipopeptide<br>
[Th]-Lys(Pam2Cys-Ser-Ser)-[B] which induced a D1 maturation rate<br>
approaching the level observed for D1 cells challenged with lipopolysaccharide<br>
(LPS). Data obtained using the non-lipidated peptide [Th]-Lys-[B] are<br>
substantially the same as for D1 cells incubated in medium without any added<br>
peptide, lipopeptide or LPS, indicating a spontaneous maturation rate of about<br>
26%.<br>
Figure 6 is a graphical representation showing anti-LHRH antibody responses<br>
elicited by lipidated (Th]-Lys(Pam2Cys)-[B] in which [Th] consists of CD4+ T cell<br>

is LHRH 1-10 (SEQ ID NO: 2) or LHRH 6-10 (i.e. the C-terminal 5 residues of<br>
LHRH; SEQ ID NO: 4), with or without a serine spacer (Ser-Ser) positioned<br>
between the lipid and peptide moieties. Lipopeptide [Th]-Lys(Pam2Cys)-<br>
GlyLeuArgProGly is structurally similar to [Th]-Lys(Pam2Cys)-[B], however this<br>
lipopeptide comprises SEQ ID NO: 4 in place of SEQ ID NO: 2.<br>
Figure 7 is a representation showing structural data, HPLC and mass spectra<br>
data for different lipopeptide constructs based on the T helper epitope P25<br>
(SEQ ID NO: 24) and LHRH 2-10 (SEQ ID NO: 3), wherein the peptide moiety<br>
has the amino acid sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 9 and the lipid moiety is<br>
selected from the group consisting of: (i) Pam2Cys; (ii) Ste2Cys; (III) Lau2Cys;<br>
and (iv) Oct2Cys. Different spacers were also positioned between the lipid<br><br>
moiety and the peptide moiety, as follows: (i) Ser-Ser, two serine residues; (ii)<br>
Arg-Arg, two arginine residues; and (iii) Ahx, 6-aminohexanoic acid. Structures<br>

lipopeptides indicated in the legend to Figure 7 having a Ser-Ser spacer<br>
between the peptide and the lipid moiety and wherein the lipid moiety is<br>
selected from the group consisting of: (i) Pam2Cys; (ii) Ste2Cys; (iii) Lau2Cys;<br>
and (iv) Oct2Cys. Groups of BALB/c mice (6-8 weeks old) were inoculated<br>
subcutaneously with 20 nmoles of peptide immunogens for both primary and<br>
secondary vaccinations. All lipopeptides were administered in saline. The non<br>
lipidated peptide [Th]-Lys-[B] was administered in CFA as a control. Sera were<br>
obtained from blood taken at 4 weeks following the primary vaccination (open<br>
circles) and 2 weeks following the secondary vaccination (closed circles).<br>
Figure 9 is a graphical representation showing immunogenicity of lipopeptide<br>
immunogens from Figure 7 having different spacers positioned between the<br>
lipid and peptide moieties, in particular spacers consisting of serine<br>
homodimers (Ser-Ser), arginine homodimers (Arg-Arg), or 6-aminohexanoic<br>
acid (Ahx). Groups of BALB/c mice (6-8 weeks old) were inoculated<br>
subcutaneously with 20 nmoles of peptide immunogens for both primary and<br>
secondary vaccinations. All lipopeptides were administered in saline. The non<br>
lipidated peptide [Th]-Lys-[B] was administered in CFA as a control. Sera were<br>
obtained from blood taken at 4 weeks following the primary vaccination (open<br>
circles) and 2 weeks following the secondary vaccination (closed circles).<br><br>
Figure 10 is a graphical representation showing quality control data for a<br>
lipopeptide construct [Th](Pam2Cys-Ser-Ser)-[B] in which the lipid moiety is<br>
pendant from the epsilon-amino group of an internal lysine residue (Lys-14)<br>
within the helper T cell epitope of the peptide set forth in SEQ ID NO: 103. The<br>
structures of the lipopeptide is indicated in the left column; an HPLC<br>
chromatogram for the lipopeptide is indicated in the middle column; and mass<br>
spectra data are shown in the right column of the figure.<br>
Figure 11 is a graphical representation showing immunogenicity of the<br>
lipopeptide immunogen described in the legend to Figure 10, compared to a<br>
lipopeptide immunogen having the lipid moiety added to an internal lysine<br>
residue positioned between the T-helper epitope and the B-cell epitope (i.e.,<br>
the lipid moiety is added to the amino acid sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 9,<br>
which differs from SEQ ID NO: 103 in having an internal lysine added between<br>
the T-helper and B-cell epitopes). A control non-lipidated peptide having the<br>
amino acid sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 9 (i.e., [Th]-Lys-[B]) was also<br>
used as a control. Groups of BALB/c mice (6-8 weeks old) were inoculated<br>
subcutaneously with 20 nmoles of peptide immunogens for both primary and<br>
secondary vaccinations. All lipopeptides were administered in saline. The non<br>
lipidated control peptide [Th]-Lys-[B] was administered in CFA. Sera were<br>
obtained from blood taken at 4 weeks following the primary vaccination (open<br>
circles) and 2 weeks following the secondary vaccination (closed circles). The<br>
lipopeptide construct [Th](Pam2Cys-Ser-Ser)-[B] has the lipid moiety attached<br>
to the epsilon-amino group of a lysine residue (Lys-14) within the helper T cell<br>
epitope. The lipopeptide construct [Th]-Lys(Pam2Cys-Ser-Ser)-[B] has the lipid<br>
attached to the epsilon-amino group of a lysine residue placed between the two<br>
peptide epitopes.<br><br>
Figure 12 is a graphical representation showing the ability of a lipopeptide<br>
comprising the T-helper epitope P25 (SEQ ID NO: 24) and a Group A<br>
Streptococcus B cell epitope ("J14"; SEQ ID NO: 101) and having the amino<br>
acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 106, and one or two lipid moieties to elicit serum<br>
IgG in mice. The lipoamino acid moiety Pam2Cys-Ser-Ser was added to an<br>
internal lysine positioned between the T-helper epitope and the B-cell epitope<br>
in all lipopeptides tested. In the Hpopeptide [Th]-Lys(Pam2Cys-Ser-Ser)-[J14],<br>
this is the only lipid moiety, whereas in the Hpopeptide Pam2Cys-Ser-Ser-|Th]-<br>
Lys(Pam2Cys-Ser-Ser)-[J14], an additional lipoamino acid moiety Pam2Cys-<br>
Ser-Ser was added to the N-terminal amino group of the T-helper epitope.<br>
Other immunogens were as follows: J14, non-lipidated peptide consisting of the<br>
J14 B-cell epitope-containing peptide (SEQ ID NO: 101); [Th]-[J14], a non-<br>
lipidated peptide consisting of the T-helper epitope (SEQ ID NO: 24) and the<br>
J14 peptide (SEQ ID NO: 101) and having the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID<br>
NO: 106; a lipidated peptide consisting of the T-helper epitope (SEQ ID NO:<br>
24) and the LHRH B-cell epitope-containing peptide (SEQ ID NO: 3) and<br>
having the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 9; and phosphate-buffered<br>
saline (PBS). Female outbred Quackenbush mice 4-6 weeks old (15/group)<br>
were inoculated intranasally with 60ug of peptide-based vaccine in a total<br>
volume of 30µl PBS. Mice received three doses of vaccine at 21-day intervals.<br>
Seven days following the final dose mice were bled from the tail vein and J14-<br>
specific serum IgG was determined. Mice that received either J14-containing<br>
lipopeptides had significantly higher (P
control groups.<br>
Figure 13 is a graphical representation showing the opsonisation capability of<br>
antisera elicited by the non-lipidated peptides and lipopeptides indicated in the<br><br>
legend to Figure 12. Female outbred Quackenbush mice 4-6 weeks old<br>
(15/group) were inoculated intranasally with 60ug of peptide-based vaccine in a<br>
total volume of 30ul PBS. Mice received three doses of vaccine at 21-day<br>
intervals. Indirect bacteriacidal assays were performed to determine the ability<br>
of sera from immunized mice to opsonise or "kill" the M1 GAS strain in vitro.<br>
Sera collected from mice immunized with either J14-containing lipopeptides<br>
were capable of significant (P

peptides and lipopeptides indicated in the legend to Figure 12 to elicit salivary<br>
IgA in mice. Female outbred Quackenbush mice 4-6 weeks old (15/group) were<br>
inoculated intranasally with 60ug of each peptide-based vaccine in a total<br>
volume of 30µl PBS. Mice received three doses of vaccine at 21-day intervals.<br>
Eight days following the final dose saliva was collected from individual mice<br>
and the average J14-specific salivary IgA antibody titres were determined by<br>
standard ELISA. The mice inoculated with either J14-containing lipopeptides<br>
had significantly (P

mice 4-6 weeks old (15/group) were inoculated intranasally with 60ug of<br>
peptide-based vaccine in a total volume of 30µl PBS. Mice received three<br>
doses of vaccine at 21-day intervals. Fecal IgA was determined 6 days<br>
following the last dose of antigen. Only mice inoculated with mono-lipidated<br>
J14-containing peptide, wherein the lipid moiety was positioned between the T-<br><br>
helper epitope and the B-cell epitope (i.e., [Th]-Lys(Pam2Cys-Ser-Ser)-[J14])<br>
had significant (P

lipopeptide immunogens based on gastrin. Groups (5 animals/group) of BALB/c<br>
mice (6-8 weeks of age) were inoculated subcutaneously in the base of tail with<br>
20nmoles of peptide immunogens. The peptides used were Gastrin-17 (SEQ<br>
ID NO: 113); [P25]-Lys-[PentaGastrin] (SEQ ID NO: 110) in which PentaGastrin<br>
is the C-terrninal sequence GWMDF of gastrin as set forth in (SEQ ID NO:<br>
102); and [P25]-Lys(Pam2Cys-Ser-Ser)-[PentaGastrin] (SEQ ID NO: 110 with<br>
lipid added to an internal lysine residue). All lipopeptides were administered in<br>
PBS and the non-lipidated peptides were administered in CFA. The negative<br>
control was saline emulsified with CFA. Sera were obtained from animals 4<br>
weeks after immunisation and at the same time the animals received a second<br>
similar dose of antigen. Mice were bled a second time 2 weeks after receiving<br>
the second dose of antigen and antibodies capable of reacting with the peptide<br>
gastrin-17 sequence detected by ELISA. The results are expressed as the titre<br>

Detailed description of the preferred embodiments<br>
Upopeptides<br>
One aspect of the invention provides an isolated lipopeptide comprising a<br>
polypeptide conjugated to one or more lipid moieties wherein:<br>
(i) said polypeptide comprises an amino acid sequence that<br>
comprises:<br>
(a)	the amino acid sequence of a T helper cell (Th) epitope and<br>
the amino acid sequence of a B cell epitope, wherein said<br>
amino acid sequences are different; and<br>
(b)	one or more internal lysine residues or internal lysine analog<br>
residues for covalent attachment of each of said lipid moieties<br>
via the epsilon-amino group or terminal side-chain group of<br>
said lysine or lysine analog; and<br>
(ii) each of said one or more lipid moieties is covalently attached<br>
directly or indirectly to an epsilon-amino group of said one or<br>
more internal lysine residues or to a terminal side-chain group of<br>
said internal lysine analog residues.<br>
As used herein, the term "lipopeptide" means any non-naturally occurring<br>
composition of matter comprising one or more lipid moieties and one or more<br>
amino acid sequences that are directly or indirectly conjugated, said<br>
composition of matter being substantially free of non-specific non-conjugated<br>
lipid or protein.<br>
By "directly" means that a lipid moiety and an amino acid sequence are not<br>
separated by a spacer molecule.<br><br>
By "indirectly" means that a lipid moiety and an amino acid sequence are<br>
separated by a spacer comprising one or more carbon-containing molecules,<br>
such as, for example, one or more amino acid residues.<br>
The amino acid sequence may be of any length, constrained by the<br>
requirement for functionality of both the T-helper epitope and the B cell epitope.<br>
As used herein, the term "internal lysine residue" means a lysine residue in the<br>
polypeptide comprising both the T-helper epitope and the B-cell epitope,<br>
wherein said lysine is not the N-terminal amino acid residue or the C-terminal<br>
residue of said polypeptide. This means that the internal lysine residue to which<br>
the lipid moiety is attached is a residue that is present in the amino acid<br>
sequence of the T helper cell epitope or the amino acid sequence of the<br>
antigen. The internal lysine residue may also be distinct from the T-helper<br>
epitope or the B-cell epitope, in which case it must link these two epitopes of<br>
the polypeptide.<br>
Similarly, the term "internal lysine analog residue" means a lysine analog<br>
residue in the polypeptide comprising both the T-helper epitope and the B-cell<br>
epitope, wherein said lysine analog is not the N-terminal amino acid residue or<br>
the C-terminal residue of said polypeptide. The criteria for establishing whether<br>
or not a lysine residue is "internal" shall apply mutatis mutandis to determining<br>
whether or not a lysine analog is internal.<br>
By "lysine analog" is meant a synthetic compound capable of being<br>
incorporated into the internal part of a peptide that has a suitable side-group to<br>
which the lipid moiety can be coupled, including an amino acid analog or non-<br>
naturally occurring amino acid having such an amino side group. Preferred<br>
lysine analogs include compounds of the following general Formula (V):<br><br><br>
wherein n is an integer from 0 to 3 and wherein X is a terminal side-chain group<br>
of said internal lysine analog residue selected from the group consisting of NH,<br>
O and S. More preferably, n is an integer having a value from 1 to 3. More<br>
preferably, X is an amino group and the lysine analog is a diamino compound.<br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment, the lysine analog is selected from the<br>
group consisting of 2,3 diaminopropionic acid (Dpr), 2,4-diaminobutyric acid<br>
(Dab) and 2,5-diaminovaleric acid [i.e. ornithine (Orn)].<br>
Those skilled in the art will know the meaning of the term "epsilon-amino<br>
group".<br>
The term "terminal side-chain group" means a substituent on the side chain of a<br>
lysine analog the is distal to the alpha-carbon of said analog, such as, for<br>
example, a beta-amino of Dpr, gamma-amino of Dab, or delta-amino of Orn.<br>
The inventors have found that the most effective lipopeptides are highly<br>
soluble. The relative ability of the lipopeptides of the invention to induce an<br>
antibody response in the absence of external adjuvant was reflected by their<br>
ability to upregulate the surface expression of MHC class II molecules on<br>
immature dendritic cells (DC), particularly D1 cells as described by Winzler et al<br>
J Exp Med 185,317,1997).<br>
As will be known to those skilled in the art, the epsilon amino group of lysine is<br>
the terminal amino group of the side chain of this amino acid. Use of the<br>
epsilon amino group of lysine or the terminal side-chain group of a lysine<br>
analog for cross-linkage to the lipid moiety facilitates the synthesis of the<br><br>
polypeptide moiety as a co-linear amino acid sequence incorporating both the<br>
T-helper epitope and the B cell epitope. There is a clear structural distinction<br>
between a lipopeptide wherein lipid is attached via the epsilon amino group of a<br>
lysine residue or the terminal side-chain group of a lysine analog and a<br>
lipopeptide having the lipid attached via an alpha amino group of lysine, since<br>
the latter-mentioned lipopeptides can only have the lipid moiety conjugated to<br>
an N-terminal residue.<br>
Accordingly, it is particularly preferred for at least one internal lysine residue or<br>
internal lysine analog to which the lipid moiety is attached to be positioned<br>
within the polypeptide moiety so as to separate the immunologically-functional<br>
epitopes. For example, the internal lysine residue or internal lysine analog<br>
residue may act as a spacer and/or linking residue between the epitopes.<br>
Naturally, wherein the internal lysine or internal lysine analog is positioned<br>
between the T-helper epitope and the B cell epitope, the lipid moiety will be<br>
attached at a position that is also between these epitopes, albeit forming a<br>
branch from the amino acid sequence of the polypeptide. Preferably, a single<br>
internal lysine residue or internal lysine analog is used to separate B cell and T-<br>
helper epitopes (e.g., any one of SEQ ID NOs: 7, 9,13,106,108,110, or 112),<br>
in which case the lipid moiety is attached via the epsilon amino group of a<br>
lysine residue or the terminal side-chain group of a lysine analog positioned<br>
between the amino acid sequences of the T helper epitope and the antigenic B<br>
cell epitope.<br>
The epsilon amino group of the internal lysine or the terminal side-chain group<br>
of a lysine analog can be protected by chemical groups which are orthogonal to<br>
those used to protect the alpha-amino and side-chain functional groups of other<br>
amino acids. In this way, the epsilon amino group of lysine or the terminal side-<br>
chain group of a lysine analog can be selectively exposed to allow attachment<br>
of chemical groups, such as lipid-containing moieties, specifically to the epsilon<br>
amino group or the terminal side-chain group as appropriate.<br><br>
For peptide syntheses using Fmoc chemistry, a suitable orthogonally protected<br>
epsilon group of lysine is provided by the modified amino acid residue Fmoc-<br>
Lys(Mtt)-OH {Nα-Fmoc-Nε-4-methyItrityl-L-lysine).	Similar suitable<br>
orthogonally-protected side-chain groups are available for various lysine<br>
analogs contemplated herein, eg. Fmoc-Orn(Mtt)-OH (Nα-Fmoc-Nδ-4-<br>
methyltrityl-L-Ornithine), Fmoc-Dab(Mtt)-OH (Nα-Fmoc-Nγ-4-methyftrityl-L-<br>
diaminobutyric acid) and Fmoc-Dpr(Mtt)-OH (Nα-Fmoc-Nβ-4-methyltrityl-L-<br>
diaminopropionic acid). The side-chain protecting group Mtt is stable to<br>
conditions under which the Fmoc group present on the alpha amino group of<br>
lysine or a lysine analog is removed but can be selectively removed with 1 %<br>
trifluoroacetic acid in dichloromethane. Fmoc-Lys(Dde)-OH (Nα-Fmoc-Nδ-1-<br>
(4,4-dimethyl-2,6-dioxocyclohex-1-ylidene)ethyl-L-lysine) or Fmoc-Lys(ivDde)-<br>
OH {Nα-Fmoc-Nε-1-(4,4-dirnethyl-2,6-dioxocyclohex-1-ylidene)-3-methylbutyl-<br>
L-lysine) can also be used in this context, wherein the Dde side-chain<br>
protecting groups is selectively removed during peptide synthesis by treatment<br>
with hydrazine.<br>
For peptide syntheses using Boc chemistry, Boc-Lys(Fmoc)-OH can be used.<br>
The side-chain protecting group Fmoc can be selectively removed by treatment<br>
with piperidine or DBU (1,8-Diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene) but remains in<br>
place when the Boc group is removed from the alpha terminus using<br>
trifluoroacetic acid.<br>
The optimum distance between the T-helper epitope and the B dell epitope,<br>
and consequently, the precise positioning and number of internal lysine or<br>
lysine analog residues in the lipopeptide of the invention, is readily determined<br>
empirically, for each combination of T helper epitopes, B cell epitopes, and<br>
lipids. In the case of synthetic peptides and polypeptides, the limitations of the<br>
synthesis methodology used to prepare the polypeptides may, in part,<br><br>
determine the separation between the T-helper epitope and the B cell epitope<br>
that is achievable, and the number and positioning of internal lysine or lysine<br>
analog residue(s).<br>
Preferably, the T helper epitope and B cell epitope are separated by at least<br>
one or two or three or four or five amino acid residues including a single<br>
internal lysine residue or lysine analog residue.<br>
The present invention clearly contemplates the addition of multiple lipid<br>
moieties to the polypeptide moiety. To achieve this, the polypeptide may<br>
include multiple internal lysine residues or multiple internal lysine analog<br>
residues or a combination thereof. Steric hindrance may occur in the addition<br>
of lipid if multiple internal lysine or lysine analog residues are positioned more<br>
closely together, thereby producing a mixture of end-products, or a reduced<br>
yield.<br>
Relevant to this consideration is the fact that it is not necessary for the entire<br>
amino acid sequence comprising the T-helper epitope or the entire amino acid<br>
sequence comprising the B cell epitope to have an immune function.<br>
Accordingly, the said amino acid sequences, whilst comprising said epitopes<br>
may have additional sequence not possessing T-helper cell activity or a B cell<br>
epitope. Where such additional sequences include one or more internal lysine<br>
or lysine analog residues, the terminal side-chain groups of such residues may<br>
serve as attachment sites for the lipid moiety. Naturally, it is essential to retain<br>
T-helper function and B cell epitope function.<br>
The positioning of the internal lysine residue or internal lysine analog for<br>
attachment of the lipid moiety should also be selected such that attachment of<br>
the lipid moiety does not interfere with the immune function of the T-helper<br>
epitope or the B cell epitope in a subject to whom the lipopeptide is<br><br>
administered. For example, depending upon the selection of lipid moiety, the<br>
attachment of said lipid within the B cell epitope may sterically hinder antigen<br>
presentation.<br>
A generalized preferred form of the lipopeptide of the invention, wherein the<br>
internal lysine or internal lysine analog is positioned between the T-helper and<br>
B-cell epitopes is provided by the general Formula (VI).<br>
Formula (VI):<br><br>
wherein:<br>
epitope	is a T-helper epitope or B-cell epitope;<br>
A	is either present or absent and consists of an amino acid spacer<br>
of about 1 to about 6 amino acids in length;<br>
n	is an integer having a value of 1,2,3, or 4;<br>
X	is a terminal side-chain group selected from the group consisting<br>
of NH, O and S and preferably consisting of NH;<br>
Y	is either present of absent and consists of a spacer of about 1 to<br>
about 6 amino acids in length, wherein it is preferred for said<br>
spacer to comprise arginine, serine or 6-aminohexanoic acid; and<br>
Z	is a lipid moiety, preferably a lipoamino acid moiety selected from<br>
the group consisting of Pam2Cys, Pam3Cys, Ste2Cys, Lau2Cys,<br>
and Octroys.<br><br>
Those skilled in the art will be aware that Ste2Cys is also known as S-[2,3-<br>
bis(stearoyloxy)propyl]cysteine or distearoyl-S-glyceryl-cysteine; that Lau2Cys<br>
is also known as S-[2,3-bis(lauroyloxy)propyl]cysteine or dilauroyl-S-glyceryl-<br>
cysteine); and that Oct2Cys is also known as S-[2,3-<br>
bis(octanoyloxy)propyl]cysteine or dioctanoyl-S-glyceryl-cysteine).<br>
The T-helper epitope is any T-helper epitope known to the skilled artisan for<br>
enhancing an immune response in a particular target subject (i.e. a human<br>
subject, or a specific non-human animal subject such as, for example, a rat,<br>
mouse, guinea pig, dog, horse, pig, or goat). Preferred T-helper epitopes<br>
comprise at least about 10-24 amino acids in length, more generally about 15<br>
to about 20 amino acids in length.<br>
Promiscuous or permissive T-helper epitopes are particularly preferred as<br>
these are readily synthesized chemically and obviate the need to use longer<br>
polypeptides comprising multiple T-helper epitopes.<br>
Examples of promiscuous or permissive T-helper epitopes suitable for use in<br>
the lipopeptides of the present invention are selected from the group consisting<br>
of:<br>
(i) a rodent or human T-helper epitope of tetanus toxoid peptide (TTP),<br>
such as, for example amino acids 830-843 of TTP (Panina-Bordignon et<br>
a/., Eur. J. Immun. 19, 2237-2242,1989);<br>
(ii) a rodent or human T-helper epitope of Plasmodium falciparum pfg27;<br>
(iii) a rodent or human T-helper epitope of lactate dehydrogenase;<br>
(iv) a rodent or human T-helper epitope of the envelope protein of HIV or<br>
HIVgp120 (Berzofsky et al., J. Clin. Invest. 88, 876-884,1991);<br><br>
(v) a synthetic human T-helper epitope (PADRE) predicted from the amino<br>
acid sequence of known anchor proteins (Alexander et ai, Immunity 1,<br>
751-761,1994);<br>
(vi) a rodent or human T-helper epitope of measles virus fusion protein (MV-<br>
F; Muller et a/., Mol. Immunol. 32, 37-47, 1995; Partidos et ai, J. Gen.<br>
Virol., 71, 2099-2105, 1990);<br>
(vii) a T-helper epitope comprising at least about 10 amino acid residues of<br>
canine distemper virus fusion protein (CDV-F) such as, for example,<br>
from amino acid positions 148-283 of CDV-F (Ghosh et a/., Immunol.<br>
104, 58-66,2001; International Patent Publication No. WO 00/46390);<br>
(viii) a human T-helper epitope derived from the peptide sequence of<br>
extracellular tandem repeat domain of MUC1 mucin (US Patent<br>
Application No. 0020018806);<br>
(ix) a rodent or human T-helper epitope of influenza virus haemagglutinin<br>
(IV-H)(Jackson et al. Virol. 198,613-623,1994;; and<br>
(x) a bovine or camel T-helper epitope of the VP3 protein of foot and mouth<br>
disease virus (FMDV-01 Kaufbeuren strain), comprising residues 173 to<br>
176 of VP3 or the corresponding amino acids of another strain of FMDV.<br>
As will be known to those skilled in the art, a T-helper epitope may be<br>
recognised by one or more mammals of different species. Accordingly, the<br>
designation of any T-helper epitope herein is not to be considered restrictive<br>
with respect to the immune system of the species in which the epitope is<br>
recognised. For example, a rodent T-helper epitope can be recognised by the<br>
immune system of a mouse, rat, rabbit, guinea pig, or other rodent, or a human<br>
or dog.<br>
More preferably, the T-helper epitope will comprise an amino acid sequence<br>
selected from the group consisting of:<br>
(i) GALNNRFQIKGVELKS from IV-H (SEQ ID NO: 1);<br><br><br><br><br>
The T-helper epitopes disclosed herein are included for the purposes of<br>
exemplification only. Using standard peptide synthesis techniques known to the<br>
skilled artisan, the T-helper epitopes referred to herein are readily substituted<br>
for a different T-helper epitope to adapt the lipopeptide of the invention for use<br>
in a different species. Accordingly, additional T-helper epitopes known to the<br>
skilled person to be useful in eliciting or enhancing an immune response in a<br>
target species are not to be excluded.<br>
Additional T-helper epitopes may be identified by a detailed analysis, using in<br>
vitro T-cell stimulation techniques of component proteins, protein fragments<br>
and peptides to identify appropriate sequences (Goodman and Sercarz, Ann.<br>
Rev. Immunol., 1, 465, (1983); Berzofsky, In: "The Year in Immunology, Vol. 2"<br>
page 151, Karger, Basel, 1986; and Livingstone and Fathman, Ann. Rev.<br>
Immunol., 5, 477,1987).<br>
The B cell epitope is conveniently derived from the amino acid sequence of an<br>
immunogenic protein, lipoprotein, or glycoprotein of a virus, prokaryotic or<br>
eukaryotic organism, including but not limited to an antigen derived from a<br><br>
mammalian subject or a bacterium, fungus, protozoan, or parasite that infects<br>
said subject. Idiotypic and anti-idiotypic B cell epitopes against which an<br>
immune response is desired are specifically included, as are lipid-modified B<br>
cell epitopes. Alternatively, the B cell epitope may be a carbohydrate antigen,<br>
such as, for example, an ABH blood group antigen, transplantation antigen (eg.<br>
Gal alpha1-3Gal beta1-4GlcNAc; Sandrin et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90,<br>
11391-11395, 1993; Galili et a/., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 84, 1369-1373,<br>
1987; Schofield et al., Nature 418:785-789,2002) or a conjugate thereof.<br>
The B-cell epitope will be capable of eliciting the production of antibodies when<br>
administered to a mammal, preferably neutralizing antibody, and more<br>
preferably, a high titer neutralizing antibody.<br>
Shorter B cell epitopes are preferred, to facilitate peptide synthesis.<br>
Preferably, the length of the B cell epitope will not exceed about 30 amino acids<br>
in length. More preferably, the B cell epitope sequence consists of about 25<br>
amino acid residues or less, and more preferably less than 20 amino acid<br>
residues, and even more preferably about 5-20 amino acid residues in length.<br>
Preferably, peptides will assume a conformation that mimics the conformation<br>
of the native polypeptide from which the B cell epitope is derived.<br>
Preferred B cell epitopes from parasites are those associated with leishmania,<br>
malaria, trypanosomiasis, babesiosis, or schistosomiasis, such as, for example<br>
a B cell epitope selected from the group consisting of:<br>

generating antibodies against Rotaviruses, Herpes viruses, Corona viruses,<br>
Picornaviruses (eg. Apthovirus), Respiratory Synctial virus, Influenza Virus,<br>
Parainfluenza virus, Adenovirus, Pox viruses, Bovine herpes virus Type I,<br>
Bovine viral diarrhea virus, Bovine rotaviruses, Canine Distemper Virus (CDV),<br>

Preferred bacteria-specific B cell epitopes are derived from and/or capable of<br>
generating antibodies against Pasteurella, Actinobacillus, Haemophilus, Listeria<br><br>
monocytogenes, Mycobacterium, Staphylococcus, E. coli, Shigella, and the<br>

comprising a non-M-protein peptide designed to maintain helical folding<br>
and antigenicity displayed within said minimum, helical, non-host-cross-<br>
reactive peptide. For example, the non-M-protein peptide (eg peptide<br>
J14) can be linked to one or more serotypic M protein peptides using<br>
chemistry that enables the immunogen to display all the individual<br>
peptides pendant from an alkane backbone, thereby conferring excellent<br>

10-13,2001, Abstract 31B; and<br>
(xvi) a B cell epitope from a protein of tetanus, such as, for example, the<br>
tetanus toxoid protein.<br>
Preferred B cell epitopes from mammalian subjects are derived from and/or<br>
capable of generating antibodies against a tumor antigen. Tumor antigens are<br>
usually native or foreign antigens, the expression of which is correlated with the<br>
development, growth, presence or recurrence of a tumor. In as much as tumor<br>
antigens are useful in differentiating abnormal from normal tissue, they are<br>
useful as a target for therapeutic intervention. Tumor antigens are well known<br>
in the art. Indeed, several examples are well-characterized and are currently<br>
the focus of great interest in the generation of tumor-specific therapies. Non-<br>
limiting examples of tumor antigens are carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA),<br><br>
prostate specific antigen (PSA), melanoma antigens (MAGE, BAGE, GAGE),<br>
and mucins, such as MUC-1.<br>
Alternatively, a preferred B cell epitope from a mammalian subject is derived<br>
from zona pellucida protein such as ZP3 (Chamberlin and Dean Proc. Natl.<br>
Acad. Sci.( USA) 87, 6014-6018, 1990) or ZP3a (Yurewicz et al., Biochim.<br>
Biophys. Acta 1174, 211-214, 1993)] of humans or other mammals such as<br>
pigs. Particuarly preferred B cell epitopes within this category include amino<br>
acid residues 323-341 of human ZP3 (Chamberlin and Dean Proc. Natl. Acad.<br>
Sci.(USA) 87, 6014-6018, 1990); amino acid residues 8-18 or residues 272-283<br>
or residues 319-330 of porcine ZP3a (Yurewicz et al., Biochim. Biophys. Acta<br>
1174, 211-214, 1993).<br>
Further preferred B cell epitopes from a mammalian subject are derived from<br>
and/or capable of generating antibodies against a peptide hormone, such as,<br>
for example, a satiety hormone (eg. leptin), a digestive hormone (eg. gastrin),<br>
or a reproductive peptide hormone [eg. luteinising hormone-releasing hormone<br>
(LHRH), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinising hormone (LH), human<br>
chorionic gonadotropin (hCG; Carlsen et al., J. Biol. Chem. 248, 6810-6827,<br>
1973), or alternatively, a hormone receptor such as, for example, the FSH<br>
receptor (Kraaij et al., J. Endocrinol. 158,127-136,1998). Particuarly preferred<br>
B cell epitopes within this category include the C-terminal portion (CTP) of b-<br>
hCG that is antigenically non cross-reactive with LH (Carlsen et al., J. Biol.<br>
Chem. 248, 6810-6827,1973).<br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment, a peptide comprising a B-cell epitope<br>
will comprise an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of:<br>
(i) EHWSYGLRPG derived from LHRH (herein referred to as "LHRH 1-10";<br>
SEQ ID NO: 2);<br><br><br><br><br><br>
(xviii) A sequence from the M. tuberculosis ESAT-6 protein selected from the<br>
group consisting of: EQQWNFAGIEAAA (SEQ ID NO: 97) and<br>
AAAWGGSGSEAYQGVQQKWDATA (SEQ ID NO: 98).<br>
(xix) GGPTRTIGGSQAQTASGLVSMFSVGPSQK (SEQ ID NO: 99) from<br>
HCV;<br>
(xx) KFQDAYNAAGGH (SEQ ID NO: 100) from M. scrofulaceum alpha<br>
antigen;<br>
(xxi) KQAEDKVKASREAKKQVEKALEQLEDKVK (SEQ ID NO: 101) from the<br>
M protein of group A Streptococcus (i.e., peptide designated herein as<br>
"J14"); and<br>
(xxii) GWMDF (SEQ ID NO: 102) from gastrin (i.e., pentagastrin consisting of<br>
the C-terminal five amino acid residues of gastrin).<br>
It will be apparent from the preceding description that the polypeptide moiety of<br>
the subject lipopeptide is synthesized conveniently as a single amino acid<br>
chain, thereby requiring no post-synthesis modification to incorporate both<br>
epitopes.<br>
A polypeptide moiety which comprises a highly immunogenic B cell epitope of<br>
LHRH (eg. SEQ ID NO: 2 or 3 or 4) linked either to a T-helper epitope of<br>
influenza virus hemagglutinin (eg. SEQ ID NO: 1) or a T-helper epitope of CDV-<br>
F (eg. SEQ ID NO: 20, 24, 26, or 44) is particularly preferred, such as, for<br>
example, a polypeptide comprising an amino acid sequence selected from the<br>
group consisting of:<br><br><br><br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment, the LHRH epitope (i.e. LHRH1-10 as<br>
set forth in SEQ ID NO: 2; LHRH 2-10 as set forth in SEQ ID NO: 3; or LHRH<br>
6-10 as set forth in SEQ ID NO: 4) is positioned such that the C-terminal<br>
glycine residue is exposed or not internal. Accordingly, the configuration set<br>
forth in any one of SEQ ID Nos: 5, 7, or 9-16 is particularly preferred.<br>
In one exemplified embodiment, LHRH 1-10 is conjugated to the T-helper<br>
epitope of influenza virus haemagglutinin (i.e., SEQ ID NO: 1) as described by<br>
the sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 5 or 7, and LHRH 2-10 or LHRH 6-10 is<br>
conjugated to a T-helper epitope of CDV-F (i.e., SEQ ID NO: 24) as described<br>
by the sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 9, 13, 103 or 104. Other<br>
combinations are clearly possible and encompassed by the present invention.<br>
In an alternative embodiment, a polypeptide moiety which comprises a highly<br>
immunogenic B cell epitope of the M protein of Group A streptococcus (eg. the<br>
J14 peptide set forth in SEQ ID NO: 101) linked to a T-helper epitope of CDV-F<br>
(eg. SEQ ID NO: 24) or influenza virus haemagglutinin (e.g., SEQ ID NO: 1) is<br>
particularly preferred, such as, for example, a polypeptide comprising an amino<br>
acid sequence selected from the group consisting of:<br>
(i) KLIPNASLIENCTKAELKQAEDKVKASREAKKQVEKALEQLEDKYK<br>
(SEQ ID NO: 105);<br><br><br>
The skilled artisan will readily be able to synthesize additional polypeptide<br>
moieties to those exemplified herein for use in the subject lipopeptides, by<br>
substituting the T-helper epitope and/or the B cell epitope of any one of SEQ ID<br>
Nos: 5-16 or any one of SEQ ID Nos: 103-112 with another T-helper epitope or<br>
B cell epitope, such as, for example a T-helper epitope set forth in any one of<br>
SEQ ID Nos: 18-56, or a B cell epitope set forth in any one of SEQ ID Nos: 57-<br>
102. Moreover, the selection of appropriate T-helper epitope and B cell<br>
combinations will be apparent to the skilled artisan from the disclosure provided<br>
herein, according to the target species and the antigen against which an<br>
immune response is sought.<br><br>
The amino acid sequences of the polypeptide moities described herein,<br>
including those exemplified polypeptides set forth in SEQ ID Nos: 5-16 and<br>
SEQ ID Nos: 103-112, may be modified for particular purposes according to<br>
methods well known to those of skill in the art without adversely affecting their<br>
immune function. For example, particular peptide residues may be derivatized<br>
or chemically modified in order to enhance the immune response or to permit<br>
coupling of the peptide to other agents, particularly lipids. It also is possible to<br>
change particular amino acids within the peptides without disturbing the overall<br>
structure or antigenicity of the peptide. Such changes are therefore termed<br>
"conservative" changes and tend to rely on the hydrophilicity or polarity of the<br>
residue. The size and/or charge of the side chains also are relevant factors in<br>
determining which substitutions are conservative.<br>
It is well understood by the skilled artisan that, inherent in the definition of a<br>
biologically functional equivalent protein or peptide, is the concept that there is<br>
a limit to the number of changes that may be made within a defined portion of<br>
"the molecule and still result in a molecule with an acceptable level of equivalent<br>
biological activity. Biologically functional equivalent peptides are thus defined<br>
herein as those peptides in which specific amino acids may be substituted.<br>
Particular embodiments encompass variants that have one, two, three, four,<br>
five or more variations in the amino acid sequence of the peptide. Of course, a<br>
plurality of distinct proteins/peptides with different substitutions may easily be<br>
made and used in accordance with the invention.<br>
Those skilled in the art are well aware that the following substitutions are<br>
permissible conservative substitutions (i) substitutions involving arginine, lysine<br>
and histidine; (ii) substitutions involving alanine, glycine and serine; and (iii)<br>
substitutions involving phenylalanine, tryptophan and tyrosine. Peptides<br>
incorporating such conservative substitutions are defined herein as biologically<br>
functional equivalents.<br><br>
The importance of the hydropathic amino acid index in conferring interactive<br>
biological function on a protein is generally understood in the art (Kyte &amp;<br>
Doolittle, J. Mol. Biol. 157, 105-132, 1982). It is known that certain amino acids<br>
may be substituted for other amino acids having a similar hydropathic index or<br>
score and still retain a similar biological activity The hydropathic index of amino<br>
acids also may be considered in determining a conservative substitution that<br>
produces a functionally equivalent molecule. Each amino acid has been<br>
assigned a hydropathic index on the basis of their hydrophobicity and charge<br>
characteristics, as follows: isoleucine (+4.5); valine (+4.2); leucine (+3.8);<br>
phenylalanine (+2.8); cysteine/cystine (+2.5); methionine (+1.9); alanine (+1.8);<br>
glycine (-0.4); threonine (-0.7); serine (-0.8); tryptophan (-0.9); tyrosine (-1.3);<br>
proline (-1.6); histidine (-3.2); glutamate (-3.5); glutamine (-3.5); aspartate (-<br>
3.5); asparagine (-3.5); lysine (-3.9); and arginine (-4.5). In making changes<br>
based upon the hydropathic index, the substitution of amino acids whose<br>
hydropathic indices are within .+/- 0.2 is preferred. More preferably, the<br>
substitution will involve amino acids having hydropathic indices within .+/- 0.1,<br>
and more preferably within about +/- 0.05.<br>
It is also understood in the art that the substitution of like amino acids is made<br>
effectively on the basis of hydrophilicity, particularly where the biological<br>
functional equivalent protein or peptide thereby created is intended for use in<br>
immunological embodiments, as in the present case (e.g. US Patent No.<br>
4,554,101), As detailed in US Patent No. 4,554,101, the following hydrophilicity<br>
values have been assigned to amino acid residues: arginine (+3.0); lysine<br>
(+3.0); aspartate (+3.0 +/- 0.1); glutamate (+3.0 +/- 0.1); serine (+0.3);<br>
asparagine (+0.2); glutamine,(+0.2); glycine (0); threonine (-0.4); proline (-0.5<br>
+/- 0.1); alanine (-0.5); histidine (-0.5); cysteine (-1.0); methionine (-1.3); valine<br>
(-1.5); leucine (-1.8); isoleucine (-1.8); tyrosine (-2.3); phenylalanine (-2.5);<br>
tryptophan (-3.4). In making changes based upon similar hydrophilicity values,<br><br>
it is preferred to substitute amino acids having hydrophilicity values within<br>
about +/- 0.2 of each other, more preferably within about +/- 0.1, and even<br>
more preferably within about +/- 0.05.<br>
Having identified peptides suitable for use as immunogens, it also is<br>
contemplated that other sterically similar compounds may be formulated to<br>
mimic the key portions of the peptide structure. Such compounds, which may<br>
be termed peptidomimetics, may be used in the same manner as the peptides<br>
of the invention and hence are also functional equivalents. The generation of a<br>
structural functional equivalent may be achieved by the techniques of modeling<br>
and chemical design known to those of skill in the art. It will be understood that<br>
all such sterically similar constructs fall within the scope of the present<br>
invention.<br>
Another method for determining the "equivalence" of modified peptides involves<br>
a functional approach. For example, a given peptide is used to generate<br>
monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies. These antibodies can then, in turn, be<br>
used to screen libraries of degenerate peptides that include thousands or<br>
hundreds of thousands of other peptides, thereby identifying structures that are,<br>
at least to a certain extent, immunologically equivalent. Of course, these<br>
structures may bear some primary sequence homology to the peptide used to<br>
generate the antibodies, but they also may be quite different.<br>
The polypeptide moiety is readily synthesized using standard techniques, such<br>
as the Merrifield method of synthesis (Merrifieid, J Am Chem Soc, 85,:2149-<br>
2154,1963) and the myriad of available improvements on that technology (see<br>

The lipid moiety may comprise any C2 to C30 saturated, monounsaturated, or<br>
polyunsaturated linear or branched fatty acyl group, and preferably a fatty acid<br>
group selected from the group consisting of: palmitoyl, myristoyl, stearoyl,<br>
lauroyl, octanoyl, and decanoyl.<br>
Lipoamino acids are particularly preferred lipid moieties within the present<br>
context. As used herein, the term "lipoamino acid" refers to a molecule<br>
comprising one or two or three or more lipids covalently attached to an amino<br>
acid residue, such as, for example, cysteine or serine or lysine or an analog<br>
thereof. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the lipoamino acid comprises<br>
cysteine and optionally, one or two or more arginine or serine residues, or<br>
alternatively, 6-aminohexanoic acid.<br>
The lipid moiety is preferably a compound having a structure of General<br>
Formula (VII):<br><br><br>
wherein:<br>
(i) X is selected from the group consisting of sulfur, oxygen, disulfide (-S-S-<br>
), methylene (-CH2-), and amino (-NH-);<br>

carbon atoms, and alkynyl having 7 to 25 carbon atoms, wherein said<br>
alkyl, alkenyl or alkynyl group is optionally substituted by a hydroxyl,<br>
amino, oxo, acyl, or cycloalkyl group; and<br>
(vi) R3 is selected from the group consisting of R'-CO-O-, R'-O-, R'-O-CO-,<br><br>
R'-NH-CO-, and R'-CO-NH-, wherein R' is selected from the group<br>
consisting of alkyl having 7 to 25 carbon atoms, alkenyl having 7 to 25<br>
carbon atoms, and alkynyl having 7 to 25 carbon atoms, wherein said<br>
alkyl, alkenyl or alkynyl group is optionally substituted by a hydroxyl,<br>
amino, oxo, acyl, or cycloalkyl group<br>
and wherein each of R1, R2 and R3 are the same or different.<br>
Depending upon the substituent, the lipid moiety of general structure VII may<br>
be a chiral molecule, wherein the carbon atoms directly or indirectly covalently<br>
bound to integers R1 and R2 are asymmetric dextrorotatory or levorotatory (i.e.<br>
an R or S) configuration.<br>
Preferably, X is sulfur; m and n are both 1; R1 is selected from the group<br>
consisting of hydrogen, and R'-CO-, wherein R' is an alkyl group having 7 to 25<br>
carbon atoms; and R2 and R3 are selected from the group consisting of R'-CO-<br>
O-, R'-O-, R'-O-CO-, R'-NH-CO-, and R'-CO-NH-, wherein R' is an alkyl group<br>
having 7 to 25 carbon atoms.<br>
Preferably, R' is selected from the group consisting of. palmitoyl, myristoyl,<br>
stearoyl, lauroyl, octanoyl, and decanoyl. More preferably, R' is selected from<br>
the group consisting of: palmitoyi, stearoyl, lauroyl, and octanoyl, and decanoyl.<br>
Each integer R' in said lipid moiety may be the same or different.<br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment, X is sulfur, m and n are both 1; R1 is<br>
hydrogen or R'-CO- wherein R' is selected from the group consisting of:<br>
palmitoyi, stearoyl, lauroyl, and octanoyl; and R2 and R3 are each R'-CO-O-<br>
wherein R' is selected from the group consisting of: palmitoyi, stearoyl, lauroyl,<br>
and octanoyl. Particularly preferred compounds wherein R' is palmitoyi are<br>
shown by Formula (I) and Formula (II) supra.<br><br><br>
wherein:<br>
(i) R4 is selected from the group consisting of: (i) an aipha-acyl-fatty acid<br>
residue consisting of between about 7 and about 25 carbon atoms; (ii)<br>
an alpha-alkyl-beta-hydroxy-fatty acid residue; (iii) a beta-hydroxy ester<br>
of an alpha-alkyl-beta-hydroxy-fatty acid residue wherein the ester group<br>
is preferably a straight chain or branched chain comprising more than 8<br>
carbon atoms; and (iv) a lipoamino acid residue; and<br>
(ii) R5 is hydrogen or the side chain of an amino acid residue.<br>
Preferably, R4 consists of between about 10 and about 20 carbon atoms, and<br>
more preferably between about 14 and about 18 carbon atoms.<br>
Optionally, wherein R4 is a lipoamino acid residue, the side-chain of the<br>
integers R4 and R5 can form a covalent linkage. For example, wherein R4<br>
comprises an amino acid selected from the group consisting of lysine, ornithine,<br>
glutamic acid, aspartic acid, a derivative of lysine, a derivative of ornithine, a<br>
derivative of glutamic acid, and a derivative of aspartic acid, then the side chain<br>
of that amino acid or derivative is covalently attached, by virtue of an amide or<br>
ester linkage, to R5.<br>
Preferably, the structure set forth in General Formula VIII is a lipid moiety<br>
selected from the group consisting of: N,N'-diacyllysine; N.N'-diacylornithine;<br>
di(monoalkyl)amide or ester of glutamic acid; di(monoalkyl)amide or ester of<br><br>
aspartic acid; a N,O-diacyl derivative of serine, homoserine, or threonine; and a<br>
N,S-diacyl derivative of cysteine or homocysteine.<br>
Amphipathic molecules, particularly those having a hydrophobicity not<br>
exceeding the hydrophobicity of Pam3Cys (Formula (I)) are also preferred.<br>
The lipid moieties of Formula (I), Formula (II), Formula (VI) or Formula (VIII) are<br>
further modified during synthesis or post-synthetically, by the addition of one or<br>
more spacer molecules, preferably a spacer that comprises carbon, and more<br>
preferably one or more amino acid residues. These are conveniently added to<br>
the lipid structure via the terminal carboxy group in a conventional<br>
condensation, addition, substitution, or oxidation reaction. The effect of such a<br>
spacer molecule is to separate the lipid moiety from the polypeptide moiety to<br>
reduce steric hindrance effects that might otherwise reduce immunogenicity of<br>
the lipopeptide product.<br>
Arginine or serine dimers, trimers, tetramers, etc, or alternatively, 6-<br>
aminohexanoic acid, are particularly preferred for this purpose.<br>
Preferably, such spacers include a terminal protected amino acid residue to<br>
facilitate the later conjugation of the modified lipoamino acid to the polypeptide.<br>
Exemplary modified lipoamino acids produced according to this embodiment<br>
are presented as Formulae (HI) and (IV), which are readily derived from<br>
Formulae (I) and (II), respectively by the addition of a serine homodimer. As<br>
exemplified herein, Pam3Cys of Formula (I), or Pam2Cys of Formula (II) is<br>
conveniently synthesized as the lipoamino acids Pam3Cys-Ser-Ser of Formula<br>
(III), or Pam2Cys-Ser-Ser of Formula (IV) for this purpose.<br><br><br>
As an alternative to the addition of a spacer to the lipid moiety, the spacer may<br>
be added to the epsilon amino group of the internal lysine residue or to the<br>
terminal side-chain group of a lysine analog in the polypeptide moiety, either as<br>
a short peptide, such as, for example an arginine or serine homodimer,<br>
homotrimer, homotetramer, etc, or alternatively, by the sequential addition of<br>
amino acid residues, thereby producing a branched polypeptide chain. This<br>
approach takes advantage of the modified nature of the epsilon amino group on<br>
the internal lysine residue or to the terminal side-chain group of a lysine analog,<br>
as appropriate, to achieve specificity in the addition of the spacer. Naturally, to<br>
avoid sequential spacer addition, the terminal amino acid residue of the spacer<br><br>
should preferably be protected, such that de-protection can facilitate<br>
conjugation of the lipid moiety to the branched polypeptide.<br>
Alternatively, the spacer may be added to a non-modified epsilon amino group<br>
of the polypeptide by conventional nucleophilic substitution reaction. However,<br>
it is preferred to follow this approach if the polypeptide has an amino acid<br>
sequence comprising a single internal lysine or lysine analog residue and a<br>
blocked N-terminus.<br>
The lipid moiety is prepared by conventional synthetic means, such as, for<br>
example, the methods described in US Patent Nos. 5,700,910 and 6,024,964,<br>
or alternatively, the method described by Wiesmuller et al., Hoppe Seylers Zur<br>
Physiol. Chem. 364, 593 (1983), Zeng et al., J. Pept. Sci 2,66 (1996), Jones et<br>
al., Xenobiotica 5, 155 (1975), or Metzger et al., Int. J. Pept.Protein Res. 38,<br>
545 (1991). Those skilled in the art will be readily able to modify such methods<br>
to achieve the synthesis of a desired lipid for use conjugation to a polypeptide.<br>
Combinations of different lipids are also contemplated for use in the<br>
lipopeptides of the invention. For example, one or two myristoyl-containing<br>
lipids or lipoamino acids are attached via internal lysine or lysine analog<br>
residues to the polypeptide moiety, optionally separated from the polypeptide<br>
by a spacer. Other combinations are not excluded.<br>
The lipopeptides of the invention are readily modified for diagnostic purposes.<br>
For example, it is modified by addition of a natural or synthetic hapten, an<br>
antibiotic, hormone, steroid, nucleoside, nucleotide, nucleic acid, an enzyme,<br>
enzyme substrate, an enzyme inhibitor, biotin, avidin, polyethylene glycol, a<br>
peptidic polypeptide moiety (e.g. tuftsin, polylysine), a fluorescence marker<br>
(e.g. FITC, RITC, dansyl, luminol or coumarin), a bioluminescence marker, a<br><br>
spin label, an alkaloid, biogenic amine, vitamin, toxin (e.g. digoxin, phalloidin,<br>
amanitin, tetrodotoxin), or a complex-forming agent.<br>
As exemplified herein, highly immunogenic and soluble lipopeptides are<br>
provided comprising Pam3Cys of Formula (I), or Pam2Cys of Formula (II) or<br>
Ste2Cys or Lau2Cys or Oct2Cys conjugated via the epsilon amino group of an<br>
internal lysine residue of a polypeptide that comprises: (i) the amino acid<br>
sequence of a CD4+ T-helper epitope derived from the light chain of influenza<br>
virus hemagglutinin (Jackson et at. Virol. 198, 613-623, 1994; i.e. amino acid<br>
sequence GALNNRFQIKGVELKS; SEQ ID NO:1) or a peptide derived from the<br>
CDV-F protein (SEQ ID NO: 24); (ii) a B-cell epitope-containing peptide<br>
comprising an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of the<br>
amino acid sequence of luteinising hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH; Fraser<br>
et at., J. Endocrinol. 63, 399 (1974); Fraser and Baker, J. Endocrinol. 77, 85<br>
(1978); i.e. "LHRH 1-10", amino acid sequence EHWSYGLRPG; SEQ ID NO:<br>
2; "LHRH 2-10", amino acid sequence HWSYGLRPG; SEQ ID NO: 3; or "LHRH<br>
6-10", amino acid sequence GLRPG; SEQ ID NO: 4), Group A Streptococcus<br>
(GAS) M protein (i.e., SEQ ID NO; 101), and pentagastrin (i.e., SEQ ID NO:<br>
102); (iii) a lysine residue positioned between said CD4+ T-helper epitope and<br>
said B-cell epitope; and optionally (iv) a lysine residue positioned within said<br>
CD4* T-helper epitope.<br>
Preparation of lipopeptides<br>
A second aspect of the invention provides a method of producing a lipopeptide<br>
comprising:<br>
(i) producing a polypeptide comprising an amino acid sequence that<br>
comprises:<br>
(a) the amino acid sequence of a T helper cell (Th) epitope and the<br>
amino acid sequence of a B cell epitope, wherein said amino acid<br>
sequences are different; and<br><br>
(b) one or more internal lysine residues or internal lysine analog<br>
residues; and<br>
(iii) covalently attaching each of said one or more lipid moieties directly or<br>
indirectly to an epsilon-amino group of said one or more internal lysine<br>
residues or to the terminal side-chain group of said one or more internal<br>
lysine analog residues so as to produce a lipopeptide having the lipid<br>
moiety attached to the epsilon amino group of said internal lysine<br>
residue or having the lipid moiety attached to the terminal side-chain<br>
group of said internal lysine analog residue.<br>
Preferably, the method further comprises production of the lipid moiety.<br>
Conventional chemical syntheses referred to herein are the preferred means<br>
for producing the polypeptide moiety and the lipid moiety.<br>
Preferably, the internal lysine residue or internal lysine analog is modified by<br>
selective removal of a blocking group (eg: Mtt) from the terminal side-chain<br>
group, particularly from the terminal side-chain amino group, so as to permit the<br>
addition of an amino acid residue, a spacer or lipid moiety, including a<br>
lipoamino acid, at that position.<br>
For attachment of the lipid to the polypeptide, it is convenient for the functional<br>
groups of the polypeptide to be protected in a manner known in the art of<br>
peptide synthesis, to ensure that no undesirable reactions at those groups<br>
takes place at a significant reaction rate.<br>
By known coupling processes, the polypeptide is synthesized on a solid or<br>
soluble carrier, such as a polymer (for example Merrifield resin) and made<br>
available for conjugation to a spacer, amino acid, or lipid. For example, the<br>
epsilon amino group of the internal lysine or the terminal side-chain group of an<br><br>
internal lysine analog is protected by one of a number of protecting groups.<br>
Blocking groups (also called protecting groups or masking groups) are used to<br>
protect the amino group of the amino acid having an activated carboxyl group<br>
that is involved in the coupling reaction, or to protect the carboxyl group of the<br>
amino acid having an acylated amino group that is involved in the coupling<br>
reaction. For coupling to occur, a blocking group must be removed without<br>
disrupting a peptide bond, or any protecting group attached to another part of<br>
the peptide.<br>
For solid phase peptide synthesis, blocking groups that are stable to the<br>
repeated treatments necessary for removal of the amino blocking group of the<br>
growing peptide chain and for repeated amino acid couplings, are used for<br>
protecting the amino acid side-chains. Additionally, the peptide-resin<br>
anchorage that protects the C-terminus of the peptide must be protected<br>
throughout the synthetic process until cleavage from the resin is required.<br>
Accordingly, by the judicious selection of orthogonally protected alpha-amino<br>
acids, lipids and/or amino acids are added at desired locations to a growing<br>
peptide whilst it is still attached to the resin.<br>
Preferred amino blocking groups are easily removable but sufficiently stable to<br>
survive conditions for the coupling reaction and other manipulations, such as,<br>
for example, modifications to the side-chain groups. Preferred amino blocking<br>
groups are slected from the group consisting of: (i) a benzyloxycarbonyl group<br>
(Z or carbobenzoxy) that is removed easily by catalytic hydrogenation at room<br>
temperature and ordinary pressure, or using sodium in liquid ammonia and<br>
hydrobromic acid in acetic acid; (ii) a t-Butoxycarbonyl group (Boc) that is<br>
introduced using t-butoxycarbonyl azide or di-tert-butyldicarbonate and<br>
removed using mild acid such as, for example, trifluoroacetic acid (50% TFA in<br>
dichloromethane), or HCI in acetic acid/dioxane/ethylacetate; (iii) a 9-<br>
fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl group (Fmoc) that is cleaved under mildly basic,<br><br>
non-hydrolytic conditions, such as, for example, using a primary or secondary<br>
amine (eg. 20% piperidine in dimethyl formamide); (iv) a 2-(4-biphenylyl)<br>
propyl(2)oxycarbonyl group (Bpoc); (v) a 2-nitro-phenylsulfenyl group (Nps);<br>
and (vi) a dithia-succionyl group (Dts).<br>
Side chain-protecting groups will vary for the functional side chains of the<br>
amino acids forming the peptide being synthesized. Side-chain protecting<br>
groups are generally based on the Bzl group or the tBu group. Amino acids<br>
having alcohols or carboxylic acids in the side-chain are protected as Bzl<br>
ethers, Bzl esters, cHex esters, tBu ethers, or tBu esters. Side-chain protection<br>
of Fmoc amino acids requires blocking groups that are ideally base stable and<br>
weak acid (TFA) labile. For example, the epsilon-amino group of lysine is<br>
protected using Mtt (eg. Fmoc-lysine(Mtt)-OH). Alternatively, a halogenated<br>
benzyl derivative such as CIZ is used to protect the lysine side chain should<br>
enhanced acid stability be required. The thiol group of Cystine, the imidazole<br>
of Histidine, or guanidino group of Arginine, generally require specialised<br>
protection. Many different protecting groups for peptide synthesis have been<br>
described (see The Peptides, Gross et al., eds., Vol. 3, Academic Press, New<br>
York, 1981).<br>
The two most widely used protection strategies are the Boc/Bzl- and the<br>
Fmoc/tBu-strategies. In Boc/Bzl, Boc is used for amino protection and the side-<br>
chains of the various amino acids are protected using Bzl- or cHex-based<br>
protecting groups. A Boc group is stable under catalytic hydrogenation<br>
conditions and is used orthogonally along with a Z group for protection of many<br>
side chain groups. In Fmoc/tBu, Fmoc is used for amino protection and the<br>
side-chains are protected with tBu-based protecting groups.<br>
Peptides are lipidated by methods well known in the art. Standard<br>
condensation, addition, substitution or oxidation (e.g. disulfide bridge formation<br><br>
or amide bond formation between a terminal amino group on the internal lysine<br>
or internal lysine analog with the carboxy terminal group of an incoming amino<br>
acid or peptide or lipoamino acid) reactions result in the addition of lipid to the<br>
polypeptide.<br>
In an alternative embodiment, a peptide of the present invention for use as an<br>
immunogen is produced by chemoselective ligation or chemical conjugation.<br>
Such methods are well-known in the art, and allow for the individual peptide<br>
components to be produced by chemical or recombinant means, followed by<br>
their chemoselective ligation in an appropriate configuration or conformation or<br>
order (eg. Nardin et ai, Vaccine 16, 590 (1998); Nardin et al., J. Immunol. 166,<br>
481 (2001); Rose et al., Mol. Immunol. 32, 1031 (1995); Rose et al, Bioconjug.<br>
Chem 7, 552 (1996); and Zeng et a/., Vaccine 18, 1031 (2000), which are<br>
incorporated herein by reference).<br>
Lipopeptide formulations<br>
The lipopeptide is coveniently formulated in a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable excipient or diluent, such as, for example, an aqueous<br>
solvent, non-aqueous solvent, non-toxic excipient, such as a salt,<br>
preservative, buffer and the like. Examples of non-aqueous solvents are<br>
propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, vegetable oil and injectable<br>
organic esters such as ethyloleate. Aqueous solvents include water,<br>
alcoholic/aqueous solutions, saline solutions, parenteral vehicles such<br>
as sodium chloride, Ringer's dextrose, etc. Preservatives include<br>
antimicrobial, anti-oxidants, chelating agents and inert gases. The pH<br>
and exact concentration of the various components the pharmaceutical<br>
composition are adjusted according to routine skills in the art.<br>
The addition of an extrinsic adjuvant to the lipopeptide formulation, although<br>
generally not required, is also encompassed by the invention. Such extrinsic<br><br>
adjuvants include all acceptable immunostimuiatory compounds such as, for<br>
example, a cytokine, toxin, or synthetic composition. Exemplary adjuvants<br>
include IL-1, IL-2, BCG, aluminum hydroxide, N-acetyl-muramyl-L-threonyl-D-<br>
isoglutamine (thur-MDP), N-acetyl-nor-muramyl-L-alanyl-D-isoglutamine (CGP<br>
11637, referred to as nor-MDP), N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanyl-D-isoglutaminyl-L-<br>
alanine-2-(1'-2'-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-hydroxyphosphoryloxy)-ethylamine<br>
(CGP) 1983A, referred to as MTP-PE), lipid A, MPL and RIBI, which contains<br>
three components extracted from bacteria, monophosphoryl lipid A, trehalose<br>
dimycolate and cell wall skeleton (MPL+TDM+CWS) in a 2% squalene/Tween<br>
80 emulsion.<br>
It may be desirable to co-administer biologic response modifiers (BRM) with the<br>
lipopeptide, to down regulate suppressor T cell activity. Exemplary BRM's<br>
include, but are not limited to, Cimetidine (CIM; 1200 mg/d) (Smith/Kline, PA,<br>
USA); Indomethacin (IND; 150 mg/d) (Lederle, NJ, USA); or low-dose<br>
Cyclophosphamide (CYP; 75, 150 or 300 mg/m.sup.2) (Johnson/Mead, NJ,<br>
USA).<br>
Use of the lipopeptide in immunization<br>
The novel lipopeptides of the invention differ in essential aspects from known<br>
lipopeptide conjugates of antigens in their enhanced solubility and<br>
immunogenicity, and their ability to elicit immune repsonses without the<br>
administration of additional adjuvant. Accordingly, a particular utility of the<br>
lipopeptides of the present invention is in the fields of antibody production,<br>
synthetic vaccine preparation, diagnostic methods employing antibodies and<br>
antibody ligands, and immunotherapy for veterinary and human medicine.<br>
More particularly, the lipopeptide of the present invention induces the specific<br>
production of a high titer antibody against the B cell epitope moiety when<br><br>
administered to an animal subject, without any requirement for an adjuvant to<br>
achieve a similar antibody titer. This utility is supported by the enhanced<br>
maturation of dendritic cells following administration of the subject lipopeptides<br>
(i.e. enhanced antigen presentation compared to lipopeptides having N-<br>
terminally coupled lipid).<br>
Accordingly, a third aspect of the invention provides a method of eliciting the<br>
production of antibody against an antigenic B cell epitope comprising<br>
administering an isolated lipopeptide comprising a polypeptide conjugated to<br>
one or more lipid moieties to said subject for a time and under conditions<br>
sufficient to elicit the production of antibodies against said antigenic B cell<br>
epitope, wherein:<br>
(i) said polypeptide comprises:<br>
(a)	the amino acid sequence of a T helper cell (Th) epitope and<br>
the amino acid sequence of a B cell epitope, wherein said<br>
amino acid sequences are different; and<br>
(b)	one or more internal lysine residues or internal lysine analog<br>
residues for covalent attachment of each of said lipid moieties<br>
via an epsilon-amino group of said internal lysine or via a<br>
terminal side-chain group of said internal lysine analog; and<br>
(ii) each of said one or more lipid moieties is covalently attached<br>
directly or indirectly to an epsilon-amino group of said one or<br>
more internal lysine residues or to a terminal side-chain group of<br>
said one or more internal lysine analog residues.<br>
The effective amount of lipopeptide used in the production of antibodies varies<br>
upon the nature of the immunogenic B cell epitope, the route of administration,<br>
the animal used for immunization, and the nature of the antibody sought. All<br>
such variables are empirically determined by art-recognized means.<br><br>
Reference herein to antibody or antibodies includes whole polyclonal and<br>
monoclonal antibodies, and parts thereof, either alone or conjugated with other<br>
moieties. Antibody parts include Fab and F(ab)2 fragments and single chain<br>
antibodies. The antibodies may be made in vivo in suitable laboratory animals,<br>
or, in the case of engineered antibodies (Single Chain Antibodies or SCABS,<br>
etc) using recombinant DNA techniques in vitro.<br>
In accordance with this aspect of the invention, the antibodies may be<br>
produced for the purposes of immunizing the subject, in which case high titer or<br>
neutralizing antibodies that bind to the B cell epitope will be especially<br>
preferred. Suitable subjects for immunization will, of course, depend upon the<br>
immunizing antigenic B cell epitope. It is contemplated that the present<br>
invention will be broadly applicable to the immunization of a wide range of<br>
animals, such as, for example, farm animals (e.g. horses, cattle, sheep, pigs,<br>
goats, chickens, ducks, turkeys, and the like), laboratory animals (e.g. rats,<br>
mice, guinea pigs, rabbits), domestic animals (cats, dogs, birds and the like),<br>
feral or wild exotic animals (e.g. possums, cats, pigs, buffalo, wild dogs and the<br>
like) and humans.<br>
Alternatively, the antibodies may be for commercial or diagnostic purposes, in<br>
which case the subject to whom the lipopeptide is administered will most likely<br>
be a laboratory or farm animal. A wide range of animal species are used for the<br>
production of antisera. Typically the animal used for production of antisera is a<br>
rabbit, a mouse, rat, hamster, guinea pig, goat, sheep, pig, dog, horse, or<br>
chicken. Because of the relatively large blood volume of rabbits, a rabbit is a<br>
preferred choice for production of polyclonal antibodies. However, as will be<br>
known to those skilled in the art, larger amounts of immunogen are required to<br>
obtain high antibodies from large animals as opposed to smaller animals such<br>
as mice. In such cases, it will be desirable to isolate the antibody from the<br>
immunized animal.<br><br>
Preferably, the antibody is a high titer antibody. By "high titer" means a<br>
sufficiently high titer to be suitable for use in diagnostic or therapeutic<br>
applications. As will be known in the art, there is some variation in what might<br>
be considered "high titer". For most applications a titer of at least about 103-104<br>
is preferred. More preferably, the antibody titer will be in the range from about<br>
104 to about 105 , even more preferably in the range from about 105 to about<br>
106.<br>
More preferably, in the case of B cell epioptes from pathogens, viruses or<br>
bacteria, the antibody is a neutralizing antibody (i.e. it is capable of neutralizing<br>
the infectivity of the organism fro which the Bcell epitope is derived).<br>
To generate antibodies, the lipopeptide, optionally formulated with any suitable<br>
or desired carrier, adjuvant, BRM, or pharmaceutically acceptable excipient, is<br>
conveniently administered in the form of an injectable composition. Injection<br>
may be intranasal, intramuscular, sub-cutaeous, intravenous, intradermal,<br>
intraperitoneal, or by other known route. The lipopeptides of the present<br>
invention have demonstrated efficacy when administered Intranasally. For<br>
intravenous injection, it is desirable to include one or more fluid and nutrient<br>
replenishers. Means for preparing and characterizing antibodies are well<br>
known in the art. (See, e.g., ANTIBODIES: A LABORATORY MANUAL, Cold<br>
Spring Harbor Laboratory, 1988, incorporated herein by reference).<br>
The efficacy of the lipopeptide in producing an antibody is established by<br>
immunizing an animal, for example, a mouse, rat, rabbit, guinea pig, dog,<br>
horse, cow, goat or pig, with a formulation comprising the lipopeptide, and then<br>
monitoring the immune response to the B cell epitope, as described in the<br>
Examples. Both primary and secondary immune responses are monitored.<br><br>
The antibody titer is determined using any conventional immunoassay, such as,<br>
for example, ELISA, or radio immunoassay.<br>
The production of polyclonal antibodies may be monitored by sampling blood of<br>
the immunized animal at various points following immunization. A second,<br>
booster injection, may be given, if required to achieve a desired antibody titer.<br>
The process of boosting and titering is repeated until a suitable titer is<br>
achieved. When a desired level of immunogenicity is obtained, the immunized<br>
animal is bled and the serum isolated and stored, and/or the animal is used to<br>
generate monoclonal antibodies (Mabs).<br>
For the production of monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) any one of a number of<br>
well-known techniques may be used, such as, for example, the procedure<br>
exemplified in US Patent No. 4,196,265, incorporated herein by reference.<br>
For example, a suitable animal will be immunized with an effective amount of<br>
the lipopeptide of the invention and under conditions sufficient to stimulate<br>
antibody producing cells. Rodents such as mice and rats are preferred<br>
animals, however, the use of rabbit, sheep, or frog cells is also possible. The<br>
use of rats may provide certain advantages, but mice are preferred, with the<br>
BALB/c mouse being most preferred as the most routinely used animal and one<br>
that generally gives a higher percentage of stable fusions.<br>
Following immunization, somatic cells capable of producing antibodies,<br>
specifically B lymphocytes (B cells), are selected for use in the MAb generating<br>
protocol. These cells may be obtained from biopsied spleens, tonsils or lymph<br>
nodes, or from a peripheral blood sample. Spleen cells and peripheral blood<br>
cells are preferred, the former because they are a rich source of antibody-<br>
producing cells that are in the dividing plasmablast stage, and the latter<br>
because peripheral blood is easily accessible. Often, a panel of animals will<br><br>
have been immunized and the spleen of animal with the highest antibody titer<br>
removed. Spleen lymphocytes are obtained by homogenizing the spleen with a<br>
syringe. Typically, a spleen from an immunized mouse contains approximately<br>
5 x 107 to 2 x 108 lymphocytes.<br>
The B cells from the immunized animal are then fused with cells of an immortal<br>
myeloma cell, generally derived from the same species as the animal that was<br>
immunized with the lipopeptide formulation. Myeloma cell lines suited for use<br>
in hybridoma-producing fusion procedures preferably are non-antibody-<br>
producing, have high fusion efficiency and enzyme deficiencies that render<br>
then incapable of growing in certain selective media which support the growth<br>
of only the desired fused cells, or hybridomas. Any one of a number of<br>
myeloma cells may be used and these are known to those of skill in the art<br>
(e.g. murine P3-X63/Ag8, X63-Ag8.653, NS1/1.Ag 4 1, Sp210-Ag14, FO,<br>
NSO/U, MPC-11, MPC11-X45-GTG 1.7 and S194/5XX0; or rat R210.RCY3,<br>
Y3-Ag 1.2.3, IR983F and 4B210; and U-266, GM1500-GRG2, LlCR-LON-HMy2<br>
and UC729-6). A preferred murine myeloma cell is the NS-1 myeloma cell line<br>
(also termed P3-NS-1-Ag4-1), which is readily available from the NIGMS<br>
Human Genetic Mutant Cell Repository under Accession No. GM3573.<br>
Alternatively, a murine myeloma SP2/0 non-producer cell line which is 8-<br>
azaguanine-resistant is used.<br>
To generate hybrids of antibody-producing spleen or lymph node cells and<br>
myeloma cells, somatic cells are mixed with myeloma cells in a proportion<br>
between about 20:1 to about 1:1, respectively, in the presence of an agent or<br>
agents (chemical or electrical) that promote the fusion of cell membranes.<br>
Fusion methods using Sendai virus have been described by Kohler and<br>
Milstein, Nature 256, 495-497,1975; and Kohler and Milstein, Eur. J. Immunol.<br>
6,511-519,1976. Methods using polyethylene glycol (PEG), such as 37% (v/v)<br><br>
PEG, are described in detail by Gefter et at., Somatic Cell Genet. 3, 231-236,<br>
1977. The use of electrically induced fusion methods is also appropriate.<br>
Hybrids are amplified by culture in a selective medium comprising an agent that<br>
blocks the de novo synthesis of nucleotides in the tissue culture media.<br>
Exemplary and preferred agents are aminopterin, methotrexate and azaserine.<br>
Aminopterin and methotrexate block de novo synthesis of both purines and<br>
pyrimidines, whereas azaserine blocks only purine synthesis. Where<br>
aminopterin or methotrexate is used, the media is supplemented with<br>
hypoxanthine and thymidine as a source of nucleotides (HAT medium). Where<br>
azaserine is used, the media is supplemented with hypoxanthine.<br>
The preferred selection medium is HAT, because only those hybridomas<br>
capable of operating nucleotide salvage pathways are able to survive in HAT<br>
medium, whereas myeloma cells are defective in key enzymes of the salvage<br>
pathway, (e.g., hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase or HPRT), and they<br>
cannot survive. B cells can operate this salvage pathway, but they have a<br>
limited life span in culture and generally die within about two weeks.<br>
Accordingly, the only cells that can survive in the selective media are those<br>
hybrids formed from myeloma and B cells.<br>
The amplified hybridomas are subjected to a functional selection for antibody<br>
specificity and/or titer, such as, for example, by immunoassay (e.g.<br>
radioimmunoassay, enzyme immunoassay, cytotoxicity assay, plaque assay,<br>
dot immunobinding assay, and the like).<br>
The selected hybridomas are serially diluted and cloned into individual<br>
antibody-producing cell lines, which clones can then be propagated indefinitely<br>
to provide MAbs. The cell lines may be exploited for MAb production in two<br>
basic ways. A sample of the hybridoma is injected, usually in the peritoneal<br><br>
cavity, into a histocompatible animal of the type that was used to provide the<br>
somatic and myeloma cells for the original fusion. The injected animal develops<br>
tumors secreting the specific monoclonal antibody produced by the fused cell<br>
hybrid. The body fluids of the animal, such as serum or ascites fluid, can then<br>
be tapped to provide MAbs in high concentration. The individual cell lines could<br>
also be cultured in vitro, where the MAbs are naturally secreted into the culture<br>
medium from which they are readily obtained in high concentrations. MAbs<br>
produced by either means may be further purified, if desired, using filtration,<br>
centrifugation and various chromatographic methods such as HPLC or affinity<br>
chromatography.<br>
Monoclonal antibodies of the present invention also include anti-idiotypic<br>
antibodies produced by methods well-known in the art. Monoclonal antibodies<br>
according to the present invention also may be monoclonal heteroconjugates,<br>
(i.e., hybrids of two or more antibody molecules). In another embodiment,<br>
monoclonal antibodies according to the invention are chimeric monoclonal<br>
antibodies. In one approach, the chimeric monoclonal antibody is engineered<br>
by cloning recombinant DNA containing the promoter, leader, and variable-<br>
region sequences from a mouse anti-PSA producing cell and the constant-<br>
region exons from a human antibody gene. The antibody encoded by such a<br>
recombinant gene is a mouse-human chimera, its antibody specificity is<br>
determined by the variable region derived from mouse sequences. Its isotype,<br>
which is determined by the constant region, is derived from human DNA.<br>
In another embodiment, monoclonal antibodies according to the present<br>
invention is a "humanized" monoclonal antibody, produced by techniques well-<br>
known in the art. That is, mouse complementary determining regions ("CDRs")<br>
are transferred from heavy and light V-chains of the mouse Ig into a human V-<br>
domain, followed by the replacement of some human residues in the framework<br>
regions of their murine counterparts. "Humanized" monoclonal antibodies in<br><br>
accordance with this invention are especially suitable for use in in vivo<br>
diagnostic and therapeutic methods.<br>
As stated above, the monoclonal antibodies and fragments thereof according to<br>
this invention are multiplied according to in vitro and in vivo methods well-<br>
known in the art. Multiplication in vitro is carried out in suitable culture media<br>
such as Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium or RPMI 1640 medium, optionally<br>
replenished by a mammalian serum such as fetal calf serum or trace elements<br>
and growth-sustaining supplements, e.g., feeder cells, such as normal mouse<br>
peritoneal exudate cells, spleen cells, bone marrow macrophages or the like. In<br>
vitro production provides relatively pure antibody preparations and allows<br>
scale-up to give large amounts of the desired antibodies. Techniques for large<br>
scale hybridoma cultivation under tissue culture conditions are known in the art<br>
and include homogenous suspension culture, (e.g., in an airlift reactor or in a<br>
continuous stirrer reactor or immobilized or entrapped cell culture).<br>
Large amounts of the monoclonal antibody of the present invention also may<br>
be obtained by multiplying hybridoma cells in vivo. Cell clones are injected into<br>
mammals which are histocompatible with the parent cells, (e.g., syngeneic<br>
mice, to cause growth of antibody-producing tumors. Optionally, the animals<br>
are primed with a hydrocarbon, especially oils such as Pristane<br>
(tetramethylpentadecane) prior to injection.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, fragments of the monoclonal antibody<br>
of the invention are obtained from monoclonal antibodies produced as<br>
described above, by methods which include digestion with enzymes such as<br>
pepsin or papain and/or cleavage of disulfide bonds by chemical reduction.<br>
The monoclonal conjugates of the present invention are prepared by methods<br>
known in the art, e.g., by reacting a monoclonal antibody prepared as<br><br>
described above with, for instance, an enzyme in the presence of a coupling<br>
agent such as glutaraldehyde or periodate. Conjugates with fluorescein<br>
markers are prepared in the presence of these coupling agents, or by reaction<br>
with an isothiocyanate. Conjugates with metal chelates are similarly produced.<br>
Other moieties to which antibodies may be conjugated include radionuclides<br>
such as, for example, 3H, 125l, .32P, .35S, 14C, 51Cr, 36CI, 57Co, 58Co, 59Fe, 75Se,<br>
and 152Eu. Radioactively labeled monoclonal antibodies of the present<br>
invention are produced according to well-known methods in the art. For<br>
instance, monoclonal antibodies are iodinated by contact with sodium or<br>
potassium iodide and a chemical oxidizing agent such as sodium hypochlorite,<br>
or an enzymatic oxidizing agent, such as lactoperoxidase. Monoclonal<br>
antibodies according to the invention may be labeled with technetium" by<br>
ligand exchange process, for example, by reducing pertechnate with stannous<br>
solution, chelating the reduced technetium onto a Sephadex column and<br>
applying the antibody to this column or by direct labeling techniques, (e.g., by<br>
incubating pertechnate, a reducing agent such as SNCI2, a buffer solution such<br>
as sodium-potassium phthalate solution, and the antibody).<br>
Any immunoassay may be used to monitor antibody production by the<br>
lipopeptide formulations. Immunoassays, in their most simple and direct sense,<br>
are binding assays. Certain preferred immunoassays are the various types of<br>
enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) and radioimmunoassays (RIA)<br>
known in the art. Immunohistochemical detection using tissue sections is also<br>
particularly useful. However, it will be readily appreciated that detection is not<br>
limited to such techniques, and Western blotting, dot blotting, FACS analyses,<br>
and the like may also be used.<br>
Most preferably, the assay will be capable of generating quantitative results.<br><br>
For example, antibodies are tested in simple competition assays. A known<br>
antibody preparation that binds to the B cell epitope and the test antibody are<br>
incubated with an antigen composition comprising the B cell epitope, preferably<br>
in the context of the native antigen. "Antigen composition" as used herein<br>
means any composition that contains some version of the B cell epitope in an<br>
accessible form. Antigen-coated wells of an ELISA plate are particularly<br>
preferred. In one embodiment, one would pre-mix the known antibodies with<br>
varying amounts of the test antibodies (e.g., 1:1,1:10 and 1:100) for a period of<br>
time prior to applying to the antigen composition. If one of the known antibodies<br>
is labeled, direct detection of the label bound to the antigen is possible;<br>
comparison to an unmixed sample assay will determine competition by the test<br>
antibody and, hence, cross-reactivity. Alternatively, using secondary antibodies<br>
specific for either the known or test antibody, one willbe able to determine<br>
competition.<br>
An antibody that binds to the antigen composition will be able to effectively<br>
compete for binding of the known antibody and thus will significantly reduce<br>
binding of the latter. The reactivity of the known antibodies in the absence of<br>
any test antibody is the control. A significant reduction in reactivity in the<br>
presence of a test antibody is indicative of a test antibody that binds to the B<br>
cell epitope (i.e., it cross-reacts with the known antibody).<br>
In one exemplary ELISA, the antibodies against the B cell epitope are<br>
immobilized onto a selected surface exhibiting protein affinity, such as a well in<br>
a polystyrene microtiter plate. Then, a composition containing the B cell epitope<br>
is added to the wells. After binding and washing to remove non-specifically<br>
bound immune complexes, the bound epitope may be detected. Detection is<br>
generally achieved by the addition of a second antibody that is known to bind to<br>
the B cell epitope and is linked to a detectable label. This type of ELISA is a<br>
simple "sandwich ELISA". Detection may also be achieved by the addition of<br><br>
said second antibody, followed by the addition of a third antibody that has<br>
binding affinity for the second antibody, with the third antibody being linked to a<br>
detectable label.<br>
Induction of sterility<br>
An appropriately configured lipopeptide of the present invention comprising an<br>
antigenic B cell epitope of a reproductive hormone or a hormone receptor is<br>
capable of inducing infertility in a subject.<br>
Accordingly, a further aspect of the invention provides a method of inducing<br>
infertility in a subject comprising administering to said subject an isolated<br>
lipopeptide comprising a polypeptide conjugated to one or more lipid moieties,<br>
wherein:<br>
(i) said polypeptide comprises:<br>
(a)	the amino acid sequence of a T helper cell (Th) epitope and<br>
the amino acid sequence of a B cell epitope of a reproductive<br>
hormone or hormone receptor, and wherein said amino acid<br>
sequences are different; and<br>
(b)	one or more internal lysine residues or internal lysine analog<br>
residues for covalent attachment of each of said lipid moieties<br>
via an epsilon-amino group of said internal lysine or via a<br>
terminal side-chain group of said internal lysine analog; and<br>
(ii) each of said one or more lipid moieties is covalently attached<br>
directly or indirectly to an epsilon-amino group of said one or<br>
more internal lysine residues or to a terminal side-chain group of<br>
said one or more internal lysine analog residues; and<br>
(iii) said lipopeptide is administered for a time and under conditions<br>
sufficient to elicit a humoral immune response against said<br>
antigenic B cell epitope.<br><br>
The lipopeptides may be administered in the form of any convenient lipopeptide<br>
formulation as described herein.<br>
By "humoral immune response" means that a secondary immune response is<br>
generated against the B cell epitope sufficient to prevent oogenesis,<br>
spermatogenesis, fertilization, implantation, or embryo development..<br>
Preferably, the humoral immunity generated includes a sustained level of<br>
antibodies against the B cell epitope in the subject. By a "sustained level of<br>
antibodies" is meant a sufficient level of circulating antibodies against the B cell<br>
epitope to prevent oogenesis, spermatogenesis, fertilization, implantation, or<br>
embryo development.<br>
Preferably, antibodies levels are sustained for at least a single reproductive<br>
cycle of an immunized female subject, and more preferably for at least about<br>
six months or 9 months or 12 months or 2 years.<br>
Preferably, the B cell epitope is derived from the amino acid sequence of<br>
luteinising hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH), follicle stimulating hormone<br>
(FSH), luteinising hormone (LH), human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), a zona<br>
pellucida protein such as ZP3, or a FSH receptor ZP3a of humans or other<br>
mammals, such as pigs.<br>
Particularly preferred B cell epitopes within this category include the C-terminal<br>
portion (CTP) of p-hCG; amino acid residues 323-341 of human ZP3; amino<br>
acid residues 8-18 or residues 272-283 or residues 319-330 of porcine ZP3a.<br>
Even more preferably, the B ceil epitope comprises an amino acid sequence<br>
selected from the group consisting of: SEQ ID NO: 2, SEQ ID NO: 3, SEQ ID<br>
NO: 4, SEQ ID NO: 76, SEQ ID NO: 77, SEQ ID NO: 78, SEQ ID NO: 79, SEQ<br><br>
ID NO: 80, SEQ ID NO: 81, SEQ ID NO: 82, SEQ ID NO: 83, and SEQ ID NO:<br>
84.<br>
The T-helper epitope preferably comprises an amino acid sequence selected<br>
from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 1, SEQ ID NO: 20, SEQ ID NO: 24,<br>
SEQ ID NO: 26 and SEQ ID NO: 44, however any one of SEQ ID Nos: 1 or 18-<br>
56 can be used.<br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment of the invention, the T-helper epitope<br>
comprises an amino acid sequence as set forth in any one of SEQ ID NO: 1,<br>
SEQ ID NO: 20, SEQ ID NO: 24, SEQ ID NO: 26 and SEQ ID NO: 44, and the<br>
B-cell epitope comprises an amino acid sequence of LHRH as set forth in SEQ<br>
ID NO: 2 or SEQ ID NO: 3 or SEQ ID NO: 4. In accordance with such a<br>
preferred embodiment, the polypeptide comprises an amino acid sequence<br>
selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID Nos: 5-16, 103 or 104. Also in<br>
accordance with this preferred embodiment, it is preferred (albeit not essential)<br>
that the lipid moiety comprise a lipoamino acid selected from the group<br>
consisting of: (i) Pam2Cys; (ii) Ste2Cys; (iii) Lau2Cys; and (iv) Oct2Cys.<br>
The sustained production of antibodies against LHRH achieved by the<br>
lipopeptides of the invention demonstrates the general utility of the subject<br>
lipopeptides as an active agent in a vaccine preparation for inducing sterility, or<br>
as a contraceptive agent.<br>
Accordingly, a further aspect of the invention provides a contraceptive agent<br>
comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent and a lipopeptide comprising<br>
an isolated polypeptide conjugated to one or more lipid moieties wherein:<br>
(i) said polypeptide comprises:<br>
(a) the amino acid sequence of a T helper cell (Th) epitope and<br>
the amino acid sequence of a B cell epitope of a reproductive<br><br>
hormone or hormone receptor, wherein said amino acid<br>
sequences are different; and<br>
(b) one or more internal lysine residues or internal lysine analog<br>
residues for covalent attachment of each of said lipid moieties<br>
via an epsilon-amino group of said internal lysine or via a<br>
terminal side-chain group of said internal lysine analog; and<br>
(ii) each of said one or more lipid moieties is covalently attached<br>
directly or indirectly to an epsilon-amino group of said one or<br>
more internal lysine residues or to a terminal side-chain group of<br>
said one or more internal lysine analog residues.<br>
The vaccine/contraceptive agent of the invention may comprise one or more<br>
carriers or excipients or other agents as described herein above under<br>
"lipopeptide formulations".<br>
Similarly, administration of the subject vaccine/contraceptive agent is achieved<br>
by means described herein above. Preferably, the subject is a human, or an<br>
animal subject such as, for example, a farm animal, laboratory animal,<br>
domestic animal, feral animal or wild exotic animal.<br>
Immunization against Group A Steptococcus<br>
Group A streptococcus (GAS) is the bacterial agent of relatively mild illnesses<br>
such as, for example, "strep throat," and impetigo, as well as rarer severe and<br>
even life-threatening diseases such as, for example, necrotizing faciitis and<br>
streptococcal toxic shock syndrome. Severe, sometimes life-threatening, GAS<br>
disease may occur when bacteria get into parts of the body where bacteria<br>
usually are not found, such as the blood, muscle, or the lungs, an infection<br>
termed "invasive GAS disease". Two of the most severe forms of invasive GAS<br>
disease are necrotizing fasciitis and Streptococcal Toxic Shock Syndrome<br>
(STSS). Necrotizing fasciitis destroys muscles, fat, and skin tissue. STSS<br><br>
causes blood pressure to drop rapidly and organs (e.g., kidney, liver, lungs) to<br>
fail. About 20% of patients with necrotizing fasciitis and more than half with<br>
STSS die. About 10%-15% of patients with other forms of invasive group A<br>
streptococcal disease die. There were about 9,400 cases of invasive GAS<br>
disease in the United States alone in 1999.<br>
invasive GAS infections generally occur when the bacteria get past the<br>
defenses of the person who is infected, such as, for example, when a person<br>
has sores or other breaks in the skin that allow the bacteria to get into the<br>
tissue, or when the person's ability to fight off the infection is decreased<br>
because of chronic illness or an illness that affects the immune system,<br>
incuding HIV/AIDS. Also, some virulent strains of GAS are more likely to cause<br>
severe disease than others. People suffering from chronic illnesses like cancer,<br>
diabetes, and kidney dialysis, and those who use medications such as steroids<br>
have a higher risk.<br>
As exemplified herein, an appropriately configured lipopeptide of the present<br>
invention comprising an antigenic B cell epitope of a Group A streptococcus<br>
antigen, preferably protein M, is capable of immunizing an animal host against<br>
GAS, and more particularly inducing serum IgG, saliva IgA and fecal IgA<br>
against the M protein of GAS, and also providing a protective immune response<br>
against a subsequent challenge by GAS thereby reducing GAS-induced<br>
mortality.<br>
Accordingly, a further aspect of the invention provides a method of inducing an<br>
immune response against a Group A streptococcus antigen in a subject<br>
comprising administering to said subject an isolated lipopeptide comprising a<br>
polypeptide conjugated to one or more lipid moieties, wherein:<br>
(iv) said polypeptide comprises:<br><br>
(b)	the amino acid sequence of a T helper cell (Th) epitope and<br>
the amino acid sequence of a B cell epitope of a Group A<br>
streptococcus antigen, wherein said amino acid sequences<br>
are different; and<br>
(c)	one or more internal lysine residues or internal lysine analog<br>
residues for covalent attachment of each of said lipid moieties<br>
via an epsilon-amino group of said internal lysine or via a<br>
terminal side-chain group of said internal lysine analog; and<br>
(v) each of said one or more lipid moieties is covalently attached<br>
directly or indirectly to an epsilon-amino group of said one or<br>
more internal lysine residues or to a terminal side-chain group of<br>
said one or more internal lysine analog residues; and<br>
(vi) said lipopeptide is administered for a time and under conditions<br>
sufficient to elicit a humoral immune response against said<br>
antigenic B cell epitope.<br>
The lipopeptides may be administered in the form of any convenient lipopeptide<br>
formulation as described herein.<br>
By "humoral immune response" means that a secondary immune response is<br>
generated against the B cell epitope sufficient to induce serum IgG, saliva IgA<br>
or fecal IgA against a peptide comprising the B-cell epitope, or alternatively or<br>
in addition, providing a protective immunity against a subsequent challenge<br>
with Group A streptococcus.<br>
Preferably, the humoral immunity generated includes a sustained level of<br>
antibodies against the B cell epitope in the subject. By a "sustained level of<br>
antibodies" is meant a sufficient level of circulating antibodies against the B cell<br>
epitope to prevent the spread of infection by a Group A streptococcus following<br><br>
a subsequently challenge, and/or reduce morbidity or mortality in a subject that<br>
is subsequently challenged with a Group A streptococcus.<br>
Preferably, antibodies levels are sustained for at least about six months or 9<br>
months or 12 months or 2 years.<br>
Preferably, the B cell epitope is derived from the amino acid sequence of the M<br>
protein of Group A streptococcus.<br>
Particularly preferred B cell epitopes within this category include a peptide that<br>
comprises the amino acid sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 101.<br>
The T-helper epitope preferably comprises an amino acid sequence selected<br>
from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 1, SEQ ID NO: 20, SEQ ID NO: 24,<br>
SEQ ID NO: 26 and SEQ ID NO: 44, however any one of SEQ ID Nos: 1 or 18-<br>
56 can be used.<br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment of the invention, the T-helper epitope<br>
comprises an amino acid sequence as set forth in SEQ ID NO: 24 and the B-<br>
cell epitope comprises an amino acid sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 101.<br>
In accordance with such a preferred embodiment, the polypeptide comprises<br>
an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID Nos:<br>
105-108. Also in accordance with this preferred embodiment, it is preferred<br>
(albeit not essential) that the lipid moiety comprise a lipoamino acid of Formula<br>
(I) or (II), however any lipid as described herein will be useful.<br>
The sustained production of antibodies against the J14 peptide achieved by the<br>
lipopeptides of the invention demonstrates the general utility of the subject<br>
lipopeptides as an active agent in a vaccine preparation for providing protective<br>
immunity against Group A streptococcus.<br><br>
Accordingly, a further aspect of the invention provides a vaccine against Group<br>
A streptococcus comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent and a<br>
lipopeptide comprising an isolated polypeptide conjugated to one or more lipid<br>
moieties wherein:<br>
(iii) said polypeptide comprises:<br>
(b)	the amino acid sequence of a T helper cell (Th) epitope and<br>
the amino acid sequence of a B cell epitope of a Group A<br>
streptococcus antigen, wherein said amino acid sequences<br>
are different; and<br>
(c)	one or more internal lysine residues or internal lysine analog<br>
residues for covalent attachment of each of said lipid moieties<br>
via an epsilon-amino group of said internal lysine or via a<br>
terminal side-chain group of said internal lysine analog; and<br>
(iv) each of said one or more lipid moieties is covalently attached<br>
directly or indirectly to an epsilon-amino group of said one or<br>
more internal lysine residues or to a terminal side-chain group of<br>
said one or more internal lysine analog residues.<br>
The vaccine of the invention may comprise one or more carriers or excipients<br>
or other agents as described herein above under "lipopeptide formulations".<br>
Similarly, administration of the subject vaccine is achieved by means described<br>
herein above, preferably by an intranasal route. Preferably, the subject is a<br>
human, or an animal subject such as, for example, a farm animal, laboratory<br>
animal, domestic animal, feral animal or wild exotic animal.<br>
Inhibition or prevention of excessive and unregulated gastric acid secretion<br>
Gastrin is known to stimulate gastric acid secretion by parietal cells, an activity<br>
mediated by binding of gastrin to gastrin receptors or cholecystekinin receptors.<br><br>
The terminal four-to-five amino acid residues of gastrin provide the same<br>
receptor specificity and activity as the full-length protein. The terminal five<br>
amino acid residues of gastrin are termed "pentagastrin". Unregulated gastrin<br>
expression or secretion causes hypergastrinemia, which can lead to Zollinger-<br>
Ellison syndrome, the formation of gastric and duodenal ulcers, or gastrinoma<br>
in the pancreas or duodenum, as a consequence of excessive and unregulated<br>
gastric acid secretion. Immunoneutralization of gastrin using antibodies against<br>
gastrin is also known to block secretion of gastric acid in response to<br>
intragastric secretion of gastrin peptides.<br>
As exemplified herein, an appropriately configured lipopeptide of the present<br>
invention comprising an antigenic B cell epitope of a gastrin peptide is capable<br>
of immunizing an animal host against gastrin or an effect of excessive gastrin<br>
production in a mouse model of other mammals in which inhibition of gastric<br>
acid secretion is indicated. The data provided herein demonstrate the general<br>
utility of the subject lipopeptides in inducing humoral immunity against gastrin<br>
and immunoneutralization of gastrin, to thereby block secretion of gastric acid,<br>
in an animal suffering from hypergastrinemia, Zollinger-Ellison syndrome,<br>
gastric ulceration or duodenal ulceration due to excessive and unregulated<br>
secretion of gastric acid, or to reduce or prevent the formation of gastrin-<br>
secreting tumors in the pancreas or duodenum (i.e. the prophylaxis and/or<br>
therapy of gastrinoma).<br>
Accordingly, a further aspect of the invention provides a method of inducing an<br>
immune response against a gastrin peptide in a subject comprising<br>
administering to said subject an isolated lipopeptide comprising a polypeptide<br>
conjugated to one or more lipid moieties, wherein:<br>
(vii) said polypeptide comprises:<br>
(c) the amino acid sequence of a T helper cell (Th) epitope and<br>
the amino acid sequence of a B cell epitope of a gastrin<br><br>
peptide antigen, wherein said amino acid sequences are<br>
different; and<br>
(d) one or more internal lysine residues or internal lysine analog<br>
residues for covalent attachment of each of said lipid moieties<br>
via an epsilon-amino group of said internal lysine or via a<br>
terminal side-chain group of said internal lysine analog; and<br>
(viii) each of said one or more lipid moieties is covalently attached<br>
directly or indirectly to an epsilon-amino group of said one or<br>
more internal lysine residues or to a terminal side-chain group of<br>
said one or more internal lysine analog residues; and<br>
(ix) said lipopeptide is administered for a time and under conditions<br>
sufficient to elicit a humoral immune response against said<br>
antigenic B cell epitope.<br>
The lipopeptides may be administered in the form of any convenient lipopeptide<br>
formulation as described herein.<br>
By "humoral immune response" means that a secondary immune response is<br>
generated against the B cell epitope sufficient to induce serum IgG against a<br>
gastrin peptide comprising the B-cell epitope.<br>
Preferably, the humoral immunity generated includes a sustained level of<br>
antibodies against the B cell epitope in the subject. By a "sustained level of<br>
antibodies" is meant a sufficient level of circulating antibodies against the B cell<br>
epitope to prevent excessive or unregulated gastric acid secretion in response<br>
to gastrin.<br>
Preferably, antibodies levels are sustained for at least about six months or 9<br>
months or 12 months or 2 years.<br><br>
Preferably, the B cell epitope is contained within a pentagastrin peptide.<br>
Particularly preferred B cell epitopes within this category include a peptide that<br>
comprises the amino acid sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 102, however the<br>
full length gastrin protein or any immunogenic fragment thereof comprising a B-<br>
cell epitope may also be used.<br>
The T-helper epitope preferably comprises an amino acid sequence selected<br>
from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 1, SEQ ID NO: 20, SEQ ID NO: 24,<br>
SEQ ID NO: 26 and SEQ ID NO: 44, however any one of SEQ ID Nos: 1 or 18-<br>
56 can be used.<br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment of the invention, the T-helper epitope<br>
comprises an amino acid sequence as set forth in SEQ ID NO: 24 and the B-<br>
cell epitope comprises an amino acid sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 102.<br>
In accordance with such a preferred embodiment, the polypeptide comprises<br>
an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID Nos:<br>
109-112. Also in accordance with this preferred embodiment, it is preferred<br>
(albeit not essential) that the lipid moiety comprise a lipoamino acid of Formula<br>
(I) or (II), however any lipid as described herein will be useful.<br>
The sustained production of antibodies against pentagastrin or gastrin that is<br>
achieved by the lipopeptides of the invention demonstrates the general utility of<br>
the subject lipopeptides as an active agent in a vaccine preparation for<br>
reducing an adverse effect of gastrin in a subject in need thereof.<br>
Accordingly, a further aspect of the invention provides a vaccine against a<br>
disease or condition induced by excessive gastrin secretion in a subject<br>
comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent and a lipopeptide comprising<br>
an isolated polypeptide conjugated to one or more lipid moieties wherein:<br>
(v) said polypeptide comprises:<br><br>
(c)	the amino acid sequence of a T helper cell (Th) epitope and<br>
the amino acid sequence of a B cell epitope of a gastrin<br>
peptide antigen, wherein said amino acid sequences are<br>
different; and<br>
(d)	one or more internal lysine residues or internal lysine analog<br>
residues for covalent attachment of each of said lipid moieties<br>
via an epsilon-amino group of said internal lysine or via a<br>
terminal side-chain group of said internal lysine analog; and<br>
(vi) each of said one or more lipid moieties is covalently attached<br>
directly or indirectly to an epsilon-amino group of said one or<br>
more internal lysine residues or to a terminal side-chain group of<br>
said one or more internal lysine analog residues.<br>
The vaccine of the invention may comprise one or more carriers or excipients<br>
or other agents as described herein above under "lipopeptide formulations".<br>
Similarly, administration of the subject vaccine is achieved by means described<br>
herein above. Preferably, the subject is a human.<br>
The present invention is further described with reference to the following non-<br>
limiting examples and the drawings.<br>

al., Hoppe Seylers Z Physiol Chem 364, 593 (1983), as modified according to<br>
the method described by Zeng et al, J Pept Sci 2, :66 (1996). The lipoamino<br>
acid Pam3Cys is coupled to the exposed epsilon-amino group of lysine<br>
according to the procedure described by Zeng et a/, (supra). Briefly, a 2-fold<br>
excess of Pam3Cys, TBTU and HOBt was dissolved in DCM and a 3-fold<br>
excess of DIPEA added. This solution was then added to the resin-bound<br>
peptide to generate the lipopeptide.<br>
Synthesis of lipid moieties of Formulae (II)<br>
Pam2Cys and its derivative Fmoc-Pam2Cys-OH were prepared according to the<br>
methods described by Jones et ai, Xenobiotica 5, 155 (1975) and Metzger et<br>
at., Int J Pept Protein Res 38, 545 (1991).<br>
Synthesis of lipopeptides<br>
Pam2Cys, Ste2Cys, Oct2Cys, or Lau2Cys were coupled to peptide using a<br>
variation of the methods described by Jones et ai, Xenobiotica 5, 155 (1975)<br>
and Metzger et al, Int J Pept Protein Res 38, 545 (1991).<br><br>
I.	Synthesis of S-(2,3-Dihydroxypropyl)cysteine:<br>
Triethylamine (6 g, 8.2 ml, 58 mmoles) was added to L-cysteine hydrochloride<br>
(3 g, 19 mmole) and 3-bromo-propan-1,2-diol (4.2 g, 2.36 ml, 27 mmole) in<br>
water and the homogeneous solution kept at room temperature for 3 days. The<br>
solution was reduced in vacuo at 40°C to a white residue which was boiled with<br>
methanol (100ml), centrifuged and the residue dissolved in water (5ml). This<br>
aqueous solution was added to acetone (300ml) and the precipitate isolated by<br>
centrifugation. The precipitate was purified by several precipitations from water<br>
with acetone to give S-(2,3-dihydroxypropyl)cysteine as a white amorphous<br>
powder (2.4 g, 12.3 mmol, 64.7%).<br>
II.	Synthesis of N-Fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl-S-(2,3-dihydroxypropyl)<br>
cysteine (Fmoc-Dhc-OH):<br>
S-(2,3-dihydroxypropyl)cysteine (2.45 g, 12.6 mmole) was dissolved in 9%<br>
sodium carbonate (20 ml). A solution of fluorenylmefhoxycarbonyl-N-<br>
hydroxysuccinimide (3.45 g, 10.5 mmole) in acetonitrile (20 ml) was added and<br>
the mixture stirred for 2 h, then diluted with water (240 ml), and extracted with<br>
diethyl ether (25 ml x 3). The aqueous phase was acidified to pH 2 with<br>
concentrated hydrochloric acid and was then extracted with ethyl acetate (70<br>
ml x 3). The extract was washed with water (50 ml x 2) and saturated sodium<br>
chloride solution (50 ml x 2), dried over sodium sulfate and evaporated to<br>
dryness. Recrystalisation from ether and ethyl acetate at -20°C yielded a<br>
colourless powder (2.8 g, 6.7 mmole, 63.8%).<br>
III. Coupling of Fmoc-Dhc-OH to resin-bound peptide:<br>
Fmoc-Dhc-OH (100mg, 0.24 mmole) was activated in DCM and DMF (1:1, v/v,<br>
3 ml) with HOBt (36 mg, 0.24 mmole) and DICI (37 ul, 0.24 mmol) at 0 °C for 5<br>
min. The mixture was then added to a vessel containing the resin-bound<br>
peptide (0.04 mmole, 0.25g amino-peptide resin). After shaking for 2 h the<br>
solution was removed by filtration and the resin was washed with DCM and<br><br>
DMF (3 x 30 ml each). The reaction was monitored for completion using the<br>
TNBSA test. If necessary a double coupling was performed.<br>
IVa. Palmitoylation of the two hydroxy groups of the Fmoc-Dhc-peptide resin:<br>
Palmitic acid (204 mg, 0.8 mmole), DICI (154 ul, 1 mmole) and DMAP (9.76<br>
mg, 0.08 mmole) were dissolved in 2 ml of DCM and 1 ml of DMF. The resin-<br>
bound Fmoc-Dhc-peptide resin (0.04 mmole, 0.25 g) was suspended in this<br>
solution and shaken for 16 h at room temperature. The solution was removed<br>
by filtration and the resin was then washed with DCM and DMF thoroughly to<br>
remove any residue of urea. The removal of the Fmoc group was accomplished<br>
with 2.5% DBU (2 x 5mins).<br>
IVb. Stearovlation of the two hydroxy groups of the Fmoc-Dhc-peptide resin:<br>
Stearic acid (about 0.8 mmole), DICI (154 ul, 1 mmole) and DMAP (9.76 mg,<br>
0.08 mmole) were dissolved in 2 ml of DCM and 1 ml of DMF. The resin-bound<br>
Fmoc-Dhc-peptide resin (0.04 mmole, 0.25 g) was suspended in this solution<br>
and shaken for 16 h at room temperature. The solution was removed by<br>
filtration and the resin was then washed with DCM and DMF thoroughly to<br>
remove any residue of urea. The removal of the Fmoc group was accomplished<br>
with 2.5% DBU (2 x 5mins).<br>
IVc. Lauroylation of the two hydroxy groups of the Fmoc-Dhc-peptide resin:<br>
Lauric acid (about 0.8 mmole), DICI (154 ul, 1 mmole) and DMAP (9.76 mg,<br>
0.08 mmole) were dissolved in 2 ml of DCM and 1 ml of DMF. The resin-bound<br>
Fmoc-Dhc-peptide resin (0.04 mmole, 0.25 g) was suspended in this solution<br>
and shaken for 16 h at room temperature. The solution was removed by<br>
filtration and the resin was then washed with DCM and DMF thoroughly to<br>
remove any residue of urea. The removal of the Fmoc group was accomplished<br>
with 2.5% DBU (2 x 5mins).<br><br>
IVd. Octanoylation of the two hydroxy groups of the Fmoc-Phc-peptide resin:<br>
Octanoic acid (about 0.8 mmole), DICI (154 ul, 1 mmole) and DMAP (9.76 mg,<br>
0.08 mmole) were dissolved in 2 ml of DCM and 1 ml of DMF. The resin-bound<br>
Fmoc-Dhc-peptide resin (0.04 mmole, 0.25 g) was suspended in this solution<br>
and shaken for 16 h at room temperature. The solution was removed by<br>
filtration and the resin was then washed with DCM and DMF thoroughly to<br>
remove any residue of urea. The removal of the Fmoc group was accomplished<br>
with 2.5% DBU (2 x 5mins).<br>
Peptide Synthesis<br>
The general procedure used for the peptide synthesis has been described by<br>
Jackson et al, Vaccine 18, 355 (1999). To enable lipid attachment between<br>
the CD4+ T cell epitope and B-cell epitope, Fmoc-lysine(Mtt)-OH was inserted<br>
at a point between the two epitopes in the approximate centre of the resin-<br>
bound peptide. If lipid was to be added to another position within the peptide,<br>
such as, for example, the Lys-14 residue of SEQ ID NO: 24, then the Fmoc-<br>
lysine(Mtt)-OH was also inserted at that position. Following completion of<br>
peptide synthesis the Mtt group was removed by continual flow washing with<br>
1% TFA in dichloromethane over a period of 30-45 mins to expose the epsilon<br>
amino group of the lysine residue. Two serine residues were coupled to this<br>
epsilon amino group in the case where two serine residues were used as<br>
spacer. Alternatively, two arginine residues were coupled to this epsilon amino<br>
group in the case where two arginine residues were used as spacer.<br>
Alternatively, 6-aminohexanoic acid was coupled to this epsilon amino group.<br>
The subsequent coupling of the lipid moiety, such as, for example, Pam3Cys,<br>
Pam2Cys, Ste2Cys, Oct2Cys, or Lau2Cys was described above.<br>
All resin-bound peptide constructs were cleaved from the solid phase support<br>
with reagent B (88% TFA, 5% phenol, 2% TIPS, 5% water) for 2 hr, and<br><br>
purified by reversed phase chromatography as described by Zeng ef al.,<br>
Vaccine 18, 1031 (2000).<br>
Analytical reversed phase high pressure liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC)<br>
was carried out using a Vydac C4 column (4.6 x 250 mm) installed in a Waters<br>
HPLC system and developed at a flow rate of 1ml/min using 0.1% TFA in H2O<br>
and 0.1% TFA in CH3CN as the limit solvent. All products presented as a<br>
single major peak on analytical RP-HPLC and had the expected mass when<br>
analysed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry on a Bruker BIFLEX instrument<br>
equipped with delayed ion extraction. The final quantitation of the immunogens<br>
was done by measuring the absorption at 280 nm exploiting the presence of a<br>
tryptophan and a tyrosine residue in the peptide constructs (molar extinction<br>
coefficient of 6.6 x103).<br>
To investigate the effect of serine by incorporating two residues between the<br>
peptide and lipid moieties of the Pam3Cys-containing peptides and Pam2Cys-<br>
containing peptides, two serine residues were added sequentially to the peptide<br>
prior to covalent attachment of the lipid moiety (the structures of which are<br>
shown in Figure 1). Summaries of their characteristics, carried out by analytical<br>
RP-HPLC and mass spectrometry, are presented in Tables 1 and 2.<br>
• Immunization protocols<br>
Groups of five female BALB/c mice, 6 to 8 weeks old, were inoculated at day 0<br>
and again on day 28. Alternatively, female outbred Quackenbush mice, 4-6<br>
weeks old, were immunized intranasally and provided with boosts as per the<br>
primary immunization at 21-day intervals. For subcutaneous (s.c.) inoculations<br>
(100 µl volume per dose), lipopeptlde constructs were prepared in saline and<br>
non-lipidated peptides formulated as an emulsion in an equal volume of<br>
complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) for the primary injection or incomplete<br>
Freund's adjuvant for the secondary inoculation. For intranasal (i.n.)<br><br>
inoculations, 50 ul of peptide in saline were applied to the nares of mice<br>
anaesthetised with penthrane for inhalation. Sera were prepared from blood<br>
taken at 4 weeks after the primary inoculation and two weeks after the<br>
secondary inoculation, or altenatively, from tail bleeds seven days following the<br>
final immunization.<br>
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA)<br>
ELISA assays were carried out on serum samples as described essentially by<br>
Ghosh et al., Int Immun. 11, 1103, (1999), using the immunizing antigen (eg.,<br>
LHRH, J14 or pentagastrin) as the coating antigen. The titres of antibody are<br>
expressed as the reciprocal of the highest dilution of serum to achieve an OD<br>
of 0.2, which represents approximately 5 times the background binding in the<br>
absence of antibody. The isotype of antibodies specific for LHRH or J14 was<br>
determined using rabbit antisera directed against mouse IgM, lgG1, lgG2a,<br>
lgG2b, lgG3 or IgA (ICN Pharmaceuticals Inc., Costa Mesa, CA) as previously<br>
described by Ghosh et al., Int Immun. 11,1103, (1999).<br>
Fertility studies<br>
After being inoculated with peptide immunogen and following exposure to male<br>
mice, female mice were tested for their ability to drop litters. A group of female<br>
mice immunized with saline in CFA was used as a control. A male mouse was<br>
introduced into a cage in which two or three female mice were kept and male<br>
mice rotated between each cage to expose each group of female mice to every<br>
male. Males and females were kept together for a total of 3 weeks at the end of<br>
which time the males were removed and the females kept under observation.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
Dendritic cell culture<br>
Dendritic cells (DC) were cultured in medium based on complete IDDM. This<br>
consisted of Iscove's Modified Dulbecco's Medium (IMDM) containing 25 mM<br>
HEPES and without alpha-thioglycerol or L-glutamine (JRH Bioscience,<br>
Lenexa, USA), supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat inactivated (56°C, 30 min)<br>
foetal calf serum (CSL Ltd., Parkville, Victoria, Australia), gentamicin (24<br>
ug/mL), giutamine (2 mM), sodium pyruvate (2 mM), penicillin (100 lU/mL),<br>
streptomycin (180 µg/mL) and 2-mercaptoethanol (0.1 mM). For DC generation<br>
complete IMDM was further supplemented with 30% supernatant from cultured<br>
NIH/3T3 cells and 5% GM-CSF in the form of a supernatant from Ag8653 cells<br>
transfected with the GM-CSF gene (DC medium).<br>
The culture method for immature dendritic cells was adapted from Winzler et<br>
a/., J. Exp Med. 185, 317 (1997). Spleen cells from a BALB/c mouse were<br>
seeded at 1.5 x 10 cells per 55 mm dish (Techno-Plas, S.A., Australia) in 3 ml<br>
DC medium and incubated at 37°C with 5% CO2. All the equipment used for<br>
culturing was pyrogen free. The medium was changed every 4 days and all<br>
cells returned to the dish. On day 12, both suspended and weakly adherent<br>
cells were collected by forcefully pipetting and then aspirating the medium. The<br>
procedure was repeated with 2 ml of PBS. The remaining strongly adherent<br>
cells were discarded. The collected cells were pelleted by centrifugation and<br>
reseeded into a new dish. Cells were subsequently maintained on a 4 day<br>
alternating cycle of media change and passage. After 1 month of continuous<br>
culturing, the floating and semi-adherent cells took on the appearance and<br>
staining characteristics of immature DC and are referred to as D1 cells. Under<br>
these passage conditions the majority of cultured D1 cells maintain an<br>
immature phenotype characterized by an intermediate expression level of cell<br>
surface MHC class II molecules.<br><br>
Flow cytometric analysis of D1 cells<br>
D1 cells (1 x 10s cells per sample) were seeded in a new Petri dish with 1 mL<br>
of DC media and incubated with 0.0045 nmole of lipopeptide, dissolved in<br>
complete IMDM medium. Lipopolysaccharide purified from E. coli serotype<br>
0111:B4 (Difco, Detroit, Michigan, USA, a kind gift from Dr. E. Margot Anders,<br>
Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Melbourne) was<br>
used at 5 ng/mL as a positive control for DC maturation. After overnight<br>
incubation, the cells were harvested and washed once with PBS with 1% FCS.<br>
To prevent non-specific binding to FCγRII/lll, the cells were pre-incubated with<br>
20 µL of normal mouse serum for 5 mins at room temperature. The cells were<br>

EXAMPLE 2<br>
Studies on lipopeptides comprising LHRH B cell epitopes<br>
Solubility properties of lipopeptides comprising LHRH<br>
Visual inspection of the different lipopeptide preparations comprising LHRH<br>
showed that they differed markedly in their solubilities (Figure 2). Enhanced<br>
solubility was most evident in those cases where lipid was attached between<br>
the two epitopes at the approximate centre of the molecule. The lipopeptides<br>
designated [Th]-Lys(Panri2Cys)-[B] and [Th]-Lys(Pam3Cys)-[B] were soluble in<br>
saline at concentrations of at least 8 mg/ml (no higher concentrations were<br>
examined), whereas constructs in which lipid was attached to the N-terminus of<br>
the sequence formed opalescent solutions at concentrations as low as 0.25<br>
mg/ml.<br>
Efforts to further enhance the solubility of peptides with N-terminally linked lipid<br>
by the incorporation of two hydrophilic serine residues between the lipid and<br>
peptide moieties (i.e. Pam2Cys-Ser-Ser-[Th]-[B] and Pam3Cys-Ser-Ser-[Th]-<br>
[B]), proved unsuccessful. In fact the lipopeptide Pam3Cys-Ser-Ser-[Th]-[B] was<br>
so insoluble that it could not be purified by RP-HPLC under conditions used for<br>
the other lipopeptides. We considered that the insoluble nature of this construct<br>
would prevent it from being considered as a viable proposition for manufacture<br>
as a vaccine.<br>
Immunogenicity of lipopeptides comprising LHRH B cell epitopes<br>
The three lipopeptides designated Pam2Cys-Ser-Ser-rTh]-|B], [Th]-<br>
Lys(Pam2Cys)-[B] and [Th]-Lys(Pam3Cys)-[B], when administered s.c. in saline<br>
induced high levels of anti-LHRH antibody. In fact, antibody titres induced after<br>
two doses of these lipopeptides were similar to those obtained with [Th]-[B] or<br>
[Th]-Lys-IB] when administered in CFA (Figure 3). The titres of anti-LHRH<br>
antibodies in sera of mice that had received Pam3Cys-Ser-Ser-[Th]-[B] or<br>
Pam2Cys-[Th]-[B] were slightly lower. The two soluble lipopeptides [Th]-<br><br>
Lys(Pam2CysHB], [Th]-Lys(Pam3CysHB] induced 10 to 100-fold higher levels<br>
of anti-LHRH antibody following the primary inoculation than did the other less<br>
soluble lipopeptide constructs. Two groups of five mice receiving [Th]-[B]<br>
admixed with Pam3Cys-Ser-(Lys)4 in the ratio 1:1 or 1:5 did not elicit significant<br>
levels of anti-LHRH antibody, a finding that contrasts with other results reported<br>
using Pam3Cys-Ser-(Lys)4as an adjuvant (Jung, G., and W. G. Bessler. (1995)<br>
In: "Immunological recognition of peptides in medicine and biology", N. D.<br>
Zegers, W. J. A. Boersma, and E. Claassen, eds.. CRC Press, Boca, New<br>
York, London, Tokyo, p. 159).<br>
The results of the fertility study carried out two weeks after the second<br>
inoculation with the various lipopeptides are shown in Table 3.<br>
None of the mice that received either of the two soluble lipopeptide constructs,<br>
[Th]-Lys(Pam2Cys)-[B] or [Th]-Lys(Pam3Cys)-[B], administered in saline or the<br>
two non-lipidated constructs [Th]-[B] or [Th]-Lys-[B] administered in CFA,<br>
became pregnant. One mouse from the group that received Pam2Cys-Ser-Ser-<br>
[Th]-[B], and two animals from the groups that received Pam3Cys-Ser-Ser-[Th]-<br>
[B] or Pam2Cys-[ThHB] dropped litters. All members of control groups of mice<br>
that received saline in CFA or the peptide [Th]-[B] co-admixed with Pam3Cys-S-<br>
(Lys)4 dropped litters.<br>
Antibody levels were followed up to 7 months after the second dose of peptide<br>
vaccine. The titres of anti-LHRH antibody present in lipopeptide-primed mice<br>
and in mice primed with non lipidated peptide administered in CFA decrease<br>
between 4 and 20 fold during a 26 week period. Three months following the<br>
secondary inoculation a fertility study carried out on all mice yielded similar<br>
results to the 2 week post-immunization trial. Mice that had received the<br>
soluble lipopeptides, [Th]-Lys(Pam2CysHB] or [Th]-Lys(Pam3Cys)-[B], in saline<br>
or the non-lipidated [Th]-[B] and [Th]-Lys-[B] in CFA were still infertile.<br><br><br><br>
Pam2Cys is a more potent adjuvant than Pam2Cys<br>
The results presented in Figure 3 and Table 2 indicate that the two branched<br>
lipopeptides [Th]-Lys(Pam2Cys)-[B] and [Th]-Lys(Pam3Cys)-[B] were not only<br>
more soluble but also elicited higher antibody titres, particularly in the primary<br>
antibody response, than did the immunogens Pam2Cys-|Th]-[B], Pam2Cys-Ser-<br>
Ser-[Th]-[B] and Pam3Cys-Ser-Ser-[Th]-[B].<br>
To examine this further, we investigated the effect of decreasing the dose on<br>
the immunogenicity of [Th]-Lys(Pam2Cys)-[B] and |Th]-Lys(Pam3Cys)-[B]. At<br>
doses of 10 nmole and 1 nmole, [Th]-Lys(Pam2Cys)-[B] induced higher<br>
antibody titres than did [Th]-Lys(Pam3Cys)-[B] (Table 4). A more striking<br>
difference was observed in the mating trial; 1 of 5 and 0 of 5 mice receiving 10<br>
and 1 nmole [Th]-Lys(Pam2Cys)-[B], respectively, dropped litters whereas 3 of<br>
5 and 5 of 5 mice receiving [Th]-Lys(Pam3Cys)-[B] at these doses dropped<br>
litters (Table 4). These results indicate that Pam2Cys-containing peptides are<br>
better immunogens than Pam2Cys- containing peptides.<br>
The effect of including two additional serine residues into the Pam2Cys-<br>
containing immunogens had little or no effect on the fertility status of animals<br>
although there was an improvement in the antibody titres that were generated<br>
following the second dose (Table 4).<br><br><br><br>
Systemic antibody responses following intranasal (i.n.) immunization<br>
We inoculated [Th]-Lys(Pam2Cys-Ser-Ser)-[B] and Pam2Cys-Ser-Ser-[Th]-[B]<br>
in saline by the intranasal route. The same vaccines were also inoculated by<br>
the subcutaneous route and the systemic anti-LHRH antibody responses were<br>
measured. The solution used for inoculation of [Th]-Lys(Pam2Cys-Ser-Ser)-[B]<br>
was clear and the one for Pam2Cys-Ser-Ser-[Th]-[B] was opalescent indicating<br>
solubility differences between the two preparations.<br>
Following two intranasal inoculations, each of the vaccines induced similar<br>
titres of serum anti-LHRH antibodies which were slightly lower than those<br>
induced following subcutaneous inoculation (Table 5). The more soluble [Th]-<br>
Lys(Pam2Cys-Ser-Ser)-[B] induced significantly higher levels of anti-LHRH<br>
antibody 4 weeks after a single dose than did the less soluble Pam2Cys-Ser-<br>
Ser-[Th]-[B] (p = 0.00007); in fact this was similar to the result obtained<br>
following subcutaneous inoculation. The fertility trial showed that two intranasal<br>
inoculations of [Th]-Lys(Pam2Cys-Ser-Ser)-[B] prevented all mice from<br>
becoming pregnant in contrast to those animals receiving Pam2Cys-Ser-Ser-<br>
[Th]-[B] intranasally in which 3 of 5 mice became pregnant.<br>
A comparison of the longevity of the responses induced by the two constructs<br>
when administered by the two different routes is also shown in Table 5. Twenty<br>
six weeks following the second dose of vaccine the levels of antibody in all<br>
mice had dropped below those observed 2 weeks after receiving the second<br>
dose. The decrease in anti-LHRH antibody in the group that received |Th]-<br>
Lys(Pam2Cys-Ser-Ser)-[B] subcutaneously, however, was much less apparent<br>
again indicating the superiority of a configuration in this context wherein<br>
Pam2Cys-Ser-Ser is attached at the approximate centre of the molecule.<br><br><br><br>
We also determined the titres of individual antibody isotypes that were directed<br>
towards LHRH and obtained from animals following two subcutaneous or<br>
intranasal doses of the soluble lipopeptide [Th]-Lys(Pam2Cys-Ser-Ser)-[B]<br>
(Figure 4). Intranasal inoculation appeared to induce higher levels of lgG3,<br>
lgG2b and possibly IgM than did subcutaneous inoculation even though the<br>
amount of total Ig induced by intranasal inoculation was less.<br>
Exposure of DC to peptides and lipopeptides induce different levels of cell<br>
surface MHC class II molecules<br>
The priming of naive CD4+ T ceils in secondary lymphoid organs by dendritic<br>
cells is preceded by maturation of DC upon exposure to antigen. This<br>
maturation is characterised by up-regulation of MHC products and co-<br>
stimulatory molecules on the DC surface. We therefore determined whether<br>
the various peptides and lipopeptides could differentially activate dendritic cells<br>
in an attempt to explain the different immunogenic properties of these vaccine<br>
candidates.<br>
The results of experiments in which a line of immature DC, D1 cells, were<br>
exposed to peptides, stained for surface expression of MHC class II molecules<br>
then analysed by flow cytometry, demonstrated that |Th]-Lys(Pam2Cys-Ser-<br>
Ser)-[B] was the most effective and Pam2Cys-[ThHB] was the least effective in<br>
causing maturation of DC (Figure 5). The ability of [Th]-Lys(Pam2Cys-Ser-<br>
Ser)-[B] to up-regulate class II expression approached that of bacterial<br>
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and Pam2Cys-Ser-Ser[Th]-[B] and [Th]-<br>
Lys(Pam2Cys)-[B] displayed intermediate levels of activation. The non-<br>
lipidated peptide was unable to induce maturation of D1 cells greater than the<br>
26% which occurs spontaneously in culture. The ability of the lipopeptides to<br>
induce the maturation of D1 cells was concentration-dependent (data not<br>
shown). The relative abilities of these lipopeptides to induce maturation of D1<br>
cells directly reflected their ability to induce antibody, providing a possible<br>
mechanism for differences in immunogenicity.<br><br>
Antibody responses to the C-terminal pentapeptide of LHRH<br>
As shown in Figure 6, approximately equivlaent antibody responses are elicited<br>
by lipidated [Th]-Lys(Pam2CysHB] in which [Th] consists of CD4+ T cell epitope<br>
from the light chain of influenza hemagglutinin (SEQ ID NO: 1) and [B] is LHRH<br>
1-10 (SEQ ID NO: 2) or LHRH 6-10 (i.e., the last C-terminal 5 residues of<br>
LHRH; SEQ ID NO: 4), with or without a serine spacer (Ser-Ser) positioned<br>
between the lipid and peptide moieties. These data support the proposition<br>
that the usefulness of the lipopeptides is not limited to any specific amino acid<br>
sequence being used as the immunizing antigen.<br>
Lipids other than Pam2Cys are useful in the lipopeptide constructs<br>
Groups of BALB/c mice (6-8 weeks old) were inoculated subcutaneously with<br>
20 nmoles of the peptide immunogens shown in Figure 7, comprising the lipid<br>
moieties Pam2Cys; Ste2Cys; Lau2Cys; or Oct2Cys conjugated to the amino acid<br>
sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 9 (i.e. a peptide comprising the CDV-F T-<br>
helper epitope of SEQ ID NO: 24 conjugated to LHRH 2-10 as set forth in SEQ<br>
ID NO: 3, with an internal lysine residue positioned between these epitopes),<br>
for both primary and secondary vaccinations. Peptide structures are shown in<br>
Figure 7. All lipopeptides were administered in saline. The non lipidated<br>
peptides was administered in CFA as a control. Sera were obtained from blood<br>
taken at 4 weeks following the primary vaccination and 2 weeks following the<br>
secondary vaccination.<br>
Data shown in Figure 8 indicate that strong primary and secondary antibody<br>
responses can be obtained when the Pam2Cys moiety is substituted for<br>
another lipid moiety in the lipopeptide constructs.<br><br>
Different spacers can be used to separate lipid from peptide in the iipopeptides<br>
Groups of BALB/c mice (6-8 weeks old) were inoculated subcutaneously with<br>
20 nmoles of the peptide immunogens shown in Figure 7, comprising the lipid<br>
moiety Pam2Cys conjugated to the amino acid sequence set forth in SEQ ID<br>
NO: 9 and separated therefrom using a spacer consisting of a serine<br>
homodimer, arginine homodimer or 6-aminohexanoic acid. Peptide structures<br>
are shown in Figure 7. All Iipopeptides were administered in saline. The non<br>
lipidated peptides was administered in CFA as a control. Sera were obtained<br>
from blood taken at 4 weeks following the primary vaccination and 2 weeks<br>
following the secondary vaccination.<br>
Data shown in Figure 9 indicate that strong primary and secondary antibody<br>
responses can be obtained when the Pam2Cys moiety is separated from the<br>
peptide moiety in the lipopeptide constructs using a variety of different spacers.<br>
The lipid moiety can be attached to an internal lysine residue within the T-<br>
helper epitope<br>
To determine the stringency of a requirement for positioning of the internal<br>
lysine residue to which the lipid moiety is attached, we also studied the<br>
immunogenicity of a lipopeptide construct wherein the lipid was attached to an<br>
internal lysine residue within the T-helper epitope. Groups of BALB/c mice (o<br>
weeks and 4 weeks old) were inoculated subcutaneously with 20 nmoles of the<br>
peptide immunogens comprising the lipid moiety Pam2Cys conjugated to the<br>
amino acid sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 9 between the T-helper epitope<br>
and B-cell epitope, or alternatively, conjugated to the amino acid sequence set<br>
forth in SEQ ID NO: 103 at position lys-14 within the T-helper epitope. Peptide<br>
structures are shown in Figures 7 and 10. All Iipopeptides were administered in<br>
saline. The non lipidated peptide was administered in CFA as a control. Sera<br>
were obtained from blood taken at 4 weeks following the primary vaccination<br>
and 2 weeks following the secondary vaccination.<br><br>
Data shown in Figure 11 indicate that strong antibody responses are obtainable<br>
using lipopeptides wherein the lipid moiety is attached to either position,<br>
suggesting that strict placement of the internal lysine and, as a consequence,<br>
the lipid moiety, is not essential to immunogenicity.<br>
Discussion<br>
In this study we describe the assembly of a variety of lipopeptide immunogens<br>
composed of a CD4+ T cell epitope, the self peptide LHRH which includes one<br>
or more B cell epitopes and Pam3Cys or Pam2Cys.<br>
Without placing any strict requirement on the need for approximate central<br>
positioning of the lipid, we found that the solubility of the resulting vaccine was<br>
greatly improved by placing lipids in the approximate centre of the peptide<br>
immunogen between the T cell epitope and LHRH instead of at the more usual<br>
position at the N-terminus. A clear solution in saline at the concentration<br>
required for inoculation could easily be obtained with these branched<br>
structures. In contrast, the immunogens in which the lipid was coupled at the N-<br>
terminus were less soluble, giving a cloudy or opalescent solution in saline.<br>
Investigation of the antibody responses and subsequent fertility trials indicated<br>
that the water-soluble lipopeptides induced higher antibody titres 4 weeks after<br>
the primary inoculation and were also more efficient in preventing pregnancy<br>
than were the less soluble lipopeptides where lipid was attached to the N-<br>
terminus. A water-soluble self-adjuvanting vaccine has clear advantages over<br>
partially soluble or insoluble material allowing for simplification of the<br>
manufacturing process and also more accurate metering of dose.<br>
Investigations into thte stringency of a requirement for positioning the lipid<br>
moiety indicated that some fexibility is possible, since antibody responses were<br>
also observed in immunized animals when the lipid was positioned within the T-<br>
helper epitope, rather than between the T-helper epitope and the B-cell<br>
epitope.<br><br>
Investigations into the effects of varying the lipopeptide dose indicated that<br>
Pam2Cys-containing lipopeptides are better immunogens than are Pam2Cys-<br>
containing peptides. However, other lipidopeptides were also useful in<br>
generating strong antibody responses, such as, for example, Ste2Cys-<br>
containing lipopeptides, Lau2Cys-containing lipopeptides, and Oct2Cys-<br>
containing lipopeptides.<br>
We found in the present study that insertion of two serine residues or two<br>
arginine residues between the lipid moiety and the peptide sequence increased<br>
the potency of the resulting Pam2Cys-containing immunogens. When lipid is<br>
attached to the N-terminus, the two serine residues could either be acting as an<br>
inert spacer between the lipid and the peptide sequence or as an extension of<br>
the T helper cell epitope and perhaps modulating immunological activity. In<br>
those cases where lipid is coupled to the epsilon-amino group of a lysine<br>
residue at the centre of the molecule, the two serine residues or two arginine<br>
residues are acting as a spacer, because the inert spacer, 6-aminohexanoic<br>
acid achieved similar results.<br>
We also found that the immunogenicity of lipopeptide constructs was not<br>
dependent upon the specific amino acid sequence of the T-helper epitope or<br>
the B-cell epitope used, indicating general utility of the approach taken to<br>
producing a wide range of lipopeptides against different antigenic B-cell<br>
epitopes and in a number of different animal hosts.<br>
It is understood that macrophages are stimulated by microbial products which<br>
bind to cell surface receptors; the signal resulting from this binding event is<br>
transmitted via Toll-like receptors and results in the production of pro-<br>
inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. These receptors are also present in<br>
populations of DC, and, when engaged, transmit signals for cellular maturation<br><br>
and migration as well as for the production of molecules required for efficient<br>
antigen presentation.<br>
The various synthetic lipopeptide vaccines used in this study were found to<br>
induce the up-regulation of class II MHC molecules, a marker used to assess<br>
DC maturation, on the surface of immature DC. In contrast, the non-lipidated<br>
peptide construct was unable to cause maturation of DC indicating that the lipid<br>
moiety is responsible for the effect. The hierarchy of lipopeptide-induced<br>
maturation of DC reflects the hierarchy of immunogenicity exhibited by the<br>
peptide constructs implies that the ability of the vaccine to interact with and<br>
Induce maturation of DC leads to a better immune response, possibly by<br>
increasing the efficiency of CD4+ T cell priming by DC that have been signalled<br>
to mature and migrate to the draining lymph node.<br>
The lipopeptides can trigger an immune response in the absence of additional<br>
adjuvant and can therefore be delivered by non-parenteral routes. We<br>
therefore investigated the antibody response following intranasal inoculation of<br>
Pam2Cys-containing peptides. The results obtained here showed that<br>
intranasal inoculation of [Th]-Lys(Pam2Cys-Ser-SerHB] or Pam2Cys-Ser-Ser-<br>
[Th]-[B] induced lower titres of systemic anti-LHRH antibody than those induced<br>
by inoculation by the subcutaneous route and also that the isotype profiles of<br>
immunoglobulins were different. Intranasal inoculation of the soluble lipopeptide<br>
[Th]-Lys(Pam2Cys-Ser-Ser)-[B] induced higher levels of lgG2b and lgG3, but<br>
lower levels of lgG1 and lgG2a compared to subcutaneous immunization. This<br>
may indicate that the two routes of immunization result in the induction of<br>
somewhat different subsets of T cells providing help for antibody production<br>
which may, in part, be due to the different populations of DCs encountered at<br>
different sites. It may also reflect a preference that dendritic cells have for<br>
molecules with unusual geometries.<br><br>
Intranasal inoculation of the water-soluble peptide construct [Th]-Lys(Pam2Cys-<br>
Ser-Ser)-[B] induced significantly higher anti-LHRH antibody titres 4 weeks<br>
after the first dose of vaccine than did insoluble Pam2Cys-Ser-Ser-[Th]-[B].<br>
Fertility trials carried out with these mice demonstrated that only intranasal<br>
inoculation with [Th]-Lys(Pam2Cys-Ser-Ser)-[B] was able to totally prevent<br>
reproduction. Although similar antibody titres were apparent in both groups of<br>
mice following the second dose of antigen, high titres of antibody were only<br>
elicited during the primary response to [Th]-Lys(Pam2Cys-Ser-Ser)-[B]. It is<br>
therefore possible that for an immunocontraceptive vaccine to be effective, the<br>
time for which high titres of antibody are present is an important determinant of<br>
efficacy.<br>
Taken together, the measurements of antibody titres and the results of the<br>
fertility trials demonstrate that placement of Pam2Cys between the B cell<br>
epitope and the T helper epitope, at the approximate centre of a totally<br>
synthetic peptide vaccine increases the solubility and also the immunogenicity<br>
of the vaccine. This improved immunogenicity is further improved by the<br>
introduction of two serine residues between the lipid and the peptide sequence<br>
of these branched peptide vaccines. The finding that incorporation of lipid, self-<br>
adjuvanting moieties into different positions of peptide-based vaccines<br>
profoundly alters physical, immunogenic and biological properties provides<br>
another strategy for successful vaccine design.<br><br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
Studies on lipopeptides comprising a B cell epitope from the<br>
M protein of Group A streptococcus<br>
The effect of multiple lipids<br>
To test whether or not immunogenicicty of the lipopeptides was dependent<br>
upon the number of lipids conjugated to the peptides, and to demonstrate that<br>
effective lipopeptides could be formulated against different antigenic B-cell<br>
epitope-containing peptides, we produced lipopeptides comprising a peptide<br>
moiety that comprises the CDV-F P25 T-helper epitope and a Group A<br>
Streptococcus B cell epitope J14 (i.e. the peptide moiety has the amino acid<br>
sequence of SEQ ID NO: 105), and one or two lipid moieties. The lipoamino<br>
acid moiety Pam2Cys-Ser-Ser was added to an internal lysine positioned<br>
between the T-helper epitope and the B-cell epitope and, in one construct, an<br>
additional lipoamino acid moiety Pam2Cys-Ser-Ser was also added to an N-<br>
terminal lysine in the T-helper epitope.<br>
Female outbred Quackenbush mice 4-6 weeks old (15/group) were inoculated<br>
intranasally with 60ug of peptide-based vaccine in a total volume of 30ul PBS.<br>
Mice received three doses of vaccine at 21-day intervals. Fecal IgA was<br>
determined 6 days following the last dose of antigen. Seven days following the<br>
final dose mice were bled from the tail vein and J14-specific serum IgG was<br>
determined. Indirect bacteriocidal assays were also performed to determine<br>
the ability of sera from immunized mice to opsonise or "kill" the M1 GAS strain<br>
in vitro. Eight days following the final dose saliva was collected from individual<br>
mice and the average J14-specific salivary IgA antibody titres were determined<br>
by standard ELISA. Two weeks after the last dose of antigen, mice were<br>
challenged intranasally with M1 GAS strain and survival determined at various<br>
time points afterwards.<br><br>
Data in Figure 12 indicate that significant (P
elicited using either lipopeptide compared to non-lipidated peptides or PBS,<br>
indicating that the lipopeptide constructs are not dependent upon the selecton<br>
of T-helper or B-cell epitope, and that lipopeptides comprising single or multiple<br>
lipid moieties can be used to elicit high serum IgG levels following intranasal<br>
immunization.<br>
Data presented in Figure 13 also indicate that sera collected from mice<br>
immunized with J14-containing lipopeptides having one or two lipid moieties<br>
were also capable of significant (P
collected from animals immunized with control non-lipidated peptides or PBS.<br>
Data presented in Figure 14 indicate that mice inoculated J14-containing<br>
lipopeptides having one or two lipid moieties had significantly (P
saliva IgA titres than the control groups that were immunized control non-<br>
lipidated peptides or PBS. However, the monolipidated peptide was far<br>
superior than the bi-lipidated peptide in inducing saliva IgA levels by intranasal<br>
administration.<br>
Interestingly, only mice inoculated with mono-lipidated J14-containing peptide,<br>
wherein the lipid moiety was positioned between the T-helper epitope and the<br>
B-cell epitope (i.e., [Th]-Lys(Pam2Cys-Ser-Ser)-[J14]) had significant (P
faecal IgA titres at 6 days following final immunization, compared to PBS or<br>
non-lipidated peptide (Figure 15). This may be a consequence of timing, since<br>
fecal IgA was determined before saliva IgA or serum IgG levels were<br>
determined. Alternatively, it may be a consequence of the intranasal<br>
administration route. Other explanations cannot be excluded at present.<br>
As shown in Figure 16, mice inoculated with with mono-lipidated J14-containing<br>
peptide, wherein the lipid moiety was positioned between the T-helper epitope<br>
and the B-cell epitope (i.e., [Th]-Lys(Pam2Cys-Ser-Ser)-[J14]) also<br>
demonstrated the best survival following intransal challenge with GAS,<br><br>
compared to the bi-lipidated peptide or non-lipidated peptide. However, some<br>
protective immunity was conferred by both the bi-lipidated peptide and non-<br>
lipidated peptide compared to the J14 peptide alone or PBS.<br>
In summary, the data presented in Examples 2 and 3 indicate that the<br>
lipopeptide formulations of the present invention are broadly applicable to<br>
inducing strong antibody responses in animals, particularly murine models, with<br>
a variety of T-helper epitopes and B-cell epitopes. Additionally, the lipopeptide<br>
formulations are particularly suited to intranasal administration, since strong<br>
IgG and IgA responses are obtained by this route. However, our data indicate<br>
that, at least for J14 immunogens, mono-lipidated peptides may serve as better<br>
mucosal adjuvants than lipopeptides comprising multiple lipid moieties.<br><br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
Studies on lipopeptides comprising a B cell epitope from gastrin<br>
The immunogenicity of lipopeptide immunogens based on gastrin was<br>
determined. Female BALB/c mice were inoculated subcutaneously in the base<br>
of the tail with 20nmoles of peptide or lipopeptide immunogens. All<br>
lipopeptides were administered in PBS and the non-lipidated peptides were<br>
administered in CFA. Saline emulsified with CFA was used as a negative<br>
control. The peptides used were Gastrin-17 (sequence<br>
EGPWLEEEEEAYGWMDF; SEQ ID NO: 113); [P25Kys-[PentaGastrin] (SEQ<br>
ID NO: 110) in which PentaGastrin is the C-terminai sequence GWMDF of<br>
gastrin-17 (i.e., SEQ ID NO: 102); and [P25]-Lys(Pam2Cys-Ser-Ser}-<br>
[PentaGastrin]. 4 weeks after immunisation sera was obtained from the<br>
animals and at the same time they received a second similar dose of antigen.<br>
Mice were bled a second time a further 2 week after the second dose of<br>
antigen and antibodies capable of reacting with the peptide gastrin-17<br>
sequence determined in ELISA.<br>
As shown in Figure 17, mice inoculated with Gastrin-17 in CFA contained levels<br>
of anti-Gastrin-17 antibodies equivalent to the negative control of Saline in<br>
CFA. While immunisation with the non-lipidated peptide [P25]-Lys-<br>
[PentaGastrin] elicited very low levels of anti-Gastrin-17 antibodies, mice<br>
challenged with the lipopeptide [P25]-Lys(Pam2Cys-Ser-Ser)-[PentaGastrin]<br>
demonstrated high antibody titres similar to that elicited after immunisation with<br>
the peptide in CFA. These data again illustrate that the lipopeptide<br>
formulations of the present invention are broadly applicable to inducing strong<br>
antibody responses in animals, with a variety of T-helper epitopes and B-cell<br>
epitopes.<br><br>
