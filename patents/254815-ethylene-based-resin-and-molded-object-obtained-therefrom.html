				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to ethylene-based resins, which are superior to known ethylene-based resins in moldability and in mechanical strength, and to articles obtainable therefrom.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Ethylene-based resins are formed by various molding methods and used in various applications. Characteristics required of ethylene-based resins vary depending on their molding method and applications. For example, when a cast film is to be formed in T-die molding, there arises neck-in wherein the edge of the film is shrunk in a direction toward the center. When neck-in occurs, the film width is decreased and simultaneously the film edge becomes thicker than the film center, thus reducing the product yield. To minimize neck-in, an ethylene-based resin having a high melt tension for the molecular weight should be selected. This property is also necessary for preventing sagging or rupture in blow molding or for preventing bubble tremble or rupture in a process of inflation film.<br>
Further, it is known that when a cast film is to be formed in T-die molding, regular variation in thickness occurring in the take-off direction of the film occurs, which is called "take-off surging", which may also be called "draw resonance." Take-off surging produces thickness variation in the film. As a result, the mechanical strength varies depending on the location. For this reason, in order to produce a film homogeneous in thickness stably, it is necessary to avoid the occurrence of take-off surging. In order to control the occurrence of take-off surging, it is believed that a resin property such that the rate of strain hardening of elongational viscosity increases as the rate of strain increases is required (for example, Toshitaka KANAI, Akira FUNAKI, Sen-i Gakkaishi (Journal of The Society of Fiber Science and Technology, Japan), 41, T-l (1986)).<br>
An already-known ethylene-based polymer obtained by using a metallocene catalyst is excellent in mechanical strength such as tensile strength, tear strength or impact resistance, but is inferior in melt tension, and thus exhibits significant neck-in. Further, take-off surging will be generated because the elongational viscosity does not show strain rate hardening property.<br>
High pressure low-density polyethylene is superior in moldability regarding such as neck-in because it has a melt tension which is greater than that of an ethylene-based polymer obtained using a metallocene catalyst. Further, no take-off surging will be generated because the elongational viscosity shows strain rate<br><br>
hardening property. However, a high-pressure low-density polyethylene has a complicated long-chain branched structure, and thus is inferior in mechanical strength such as tensile strength, tear strength or impact strength.<br>
As an ethylene-based polymer which maintains moldability regarding such as neck-in and take-off surging and has mechanical strength, a composition comprising an ethylene-based polymer obtained by using a metallocene catalyst and a high-pressure low-density polyethylene is proposed in, for example, Japanese Patent Applications Laid-OpenNo. H6-65443 andH7-26079, etc. When the content of high-pressure low-density polyethylene is high, however, the composition is expected to be inferior in mechanical strength such as tensile strength, tear strength or impact resistance. When the content of high-pressure low-density polyethylene is low, the composition does not sufficiently improve in melt tension, and is thus expected to exhibit deterioration in moldability, such as occurrence of significant neck-in.<br>
To solve the problem, various ethylene-based polymers having long branches introduced into them by means of a metallocene catalyst have been disclosed.  Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. H2-276807 discloses an ethylene-based polymer obtained by solution polymerization in the presence of a catalyst consisting of ethylene bis (indenyl) hafnium dichloride and methyl alumoxane, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. H4-213309<br><br>
discloses an ethylene-based polymer obtained by gaseous phase polymerization in the presence of a catalyst comprising ethylene bis(indenyl) zirconium dichloride and methyl alumoxane carried on silica, W093/08221 discloses an ethylene-based polymer obtained by solution polymerization in the presence of a constraint geometrical catalyst, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 8-311260 discloses an ethylene-based polymer obtained by gaseous phase polymerization in the presence of a catalyst comprising a racemate and mesoisomer of Me2Si (2-Me-Ind)2 carried on silica and methyl alumoxane.  It is described that these ethylene-based polymers, as compared with long branch-free linear ethylene-based polymers, are excellent in moldability with improvement in melt tension, but neck-in is still significant so improvement in moldability is expected to be insufficient. Unlike high-pressure low-density polyethylene, such ethylene-based polymers do not show strain rate hardening property with respect to elongational viscosity. Therefore, improvement in take-off surging cannot be expected.<br>
As described above, it was difficult to effectively obtain ethylene-based resin excellent in moldability, e.g. regarding neck-in and take-off surging, and mechanical strength by using conventional technologies.<br>
The present inventors have made extensive study in view of these circumstances, and as a result, we have found that an<br><br>
ethylene-based polymer which generates less neck-in in T-die molding and no take-off surging and which is excellent in mechanical strength is obtained by imparting a specific molecular structure and melt physical properties thereto, and the present invention has been thereby completed.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
The ethylene-based resin of the present invention is characterized in simultaneously satisfying the requirements [1] to [5] described below:<br>
[1] melt flow rate (MFR) under a loading of 2.16 kg at 190°C is in the range of 0.1 to 100 g/10 minutes; [2] density (d) is in the range of 875 to 970 kg/m3; [3] ratio [MT/n* (g/P) ] of melt tension [MT (g) ] at 190°C to shear viscosity [N* (P) ] at200°C at an angular velocity of 1. 0 rad/sec. is in the range of l.SOxlO"4 to 9.00xlO~4;<br>
[4] sum [ (A+B) (/1000C) ] of the number of methyl branches [A(/1000C&gt; ] and the number of ethyl branches [B(/1000C) ] per 1000 carbon atoms measured by 13C-NMR is 1.8 or less; and<br>
[5] zero shearing viscosity [0(P)] at 200°C and weight-average<br>
molecular weight (Mw) measured by GPC-viscosity detector method<br>
(GPC-VISCO) satisfy the following relational expression (Eq-1):<br>
(Equation Removed).<br>
One aspect of the ethylene-based resin of the present<br><br>
invention is an ethylene-based resin which is obtained by<br>
copolymerizing ethylene and an a-olef in having 4 to 10 carbon atoms and which satisfies the above-mentioned requirements [1] to [5] simultaneously.<br>
Further, the present invention relates to a molded object, preferably a film, obtained from the ethylene-based polymer described above.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>

In the graph, open squares represent Examples and filled squares represent Comparative Examples. Each number in the graph is an Example number or a Comparative Example number. The two straight lines in the graph are boundary lines, which show the upper and lower limits of the formula using parameters.<br>
BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
Hereinafter, the ethylene-based polymers [R] of the present invention are specifically described.<br>
Although the ethylene-based resin [R] of the present invention may consist of either a single kind of ethylene-based polymer or two or more kinds of ethylene-based polymers, it is<br>
characterized by necessarily satisfying all the requirements [1] to [5]. When the ethylene-based resin [R] of the present invention consists of a single kind of ethylene-based polymer, the ethylene-based polymer [Rl] is efficiently produced by the polymerization method mentioned later. When the ethylene-based resin [R] of the present invention consists of two or more kinds of ethylene-based polymers, it preferably includes the aforesaid ethylene-based polymer [Rl]. Examples of the ethylene-based polymer (s) [R2] other than the ethylene-based polymer [Rl] include<br>
copolymers of ethylene and an α-olef in having 4 to 10 carbon atoms, which are obtained by use of a metallocene catalyst or a Ziegler catalyst, and high-pressure low-density polyethylene, which is produced by the high-pressure radical polymerizationmethod.  When it consists of two or more kinds of ethylene-based polymers, the composition ratio of the ethylene-based polymer [Rl] to the ethylene-based polymer(s) [R2] and the kind(s) of the ethylene-based polymer(s) [R2] are not particularly limited if the [Rl] and the [R2] can be blended and the blended resin satisfies the requirements [1] to [5] simultaneously. However, in use for industrial applications mentioned later, the composition ratio of the ethylene-based polymer [Rl] in the ethylene-based resin [R] is usually set to 99% by weight or less, preferably 70% by weight or less, and more preferably 30% by weight or less. The ethylene-based resin [R] of the present invention is usually<br>
constituted only of the ethylene-based polymer [Rl] from the viewpoint that treatment steps such as blending can be omitted. On the other hand, when one wants to promote characteristic performance of the ethylene-based polymer [Rl] more noticeably, or when one wish to add a new performance, which the ethylene-based polymer [Rl] does not have inherently, [Rl] is used together with the aforementioned ethylene-based polymer [R2] together in a blend form.<br>
The ethylene-based resin [R] of the present invention is characterized in simultaneously satisfying the requirements [1] to [5] described above.  Hereinafter, these requirements [1] to [5] are described concretely. Requirement [1]<br>
The melt flow rate (MFR) of the ethylene-based resin [R] of the present invention at 190°C under a loading of 2.16 kg is in the range of 0.1 to 100 g/10 minutes, preferably 1.0 to 50 g/10 minutes, more preferably 4.0 to 30 g/10 minutes. When the MFR is 1.0 g/10 minutes or more, the shear viscosity of the ethylene-based resin is not too high and is excellent inmoldability and results in good appearance, for example, when it is molded into a film. When the MFR is 100 g/10 minutes or lower, the ethylene-based resin is excellent in tensile strength and heat seal strength. The MFR is a value measured under the conditions of 190°C and 2.16 kg loading according to ASTM D1238-89.<br>
Generally, the MFR depends strongly on the molecular weight. That is, the smaller the MFR, the larger the molecular weight; whereas the greater the MFR, the smaller the molecular weight. It is known that the molecular weight of the ethylene-based resin [R] of the present invention is determined by the compositional ratio of hydrogen to ethylene (hydrogen/ethylene) in the polymerization system during the production of the ethylene-based polymer constituting the resin (for example, Kazuo Soga, KODANSHA "CATALYTIC OLEFIN POLYMERIZATION", p. 376 (1990)).  Accordingly, hydrogen/ethylene is increased or decreased, whereby an ethylene-based resin [R] having an MFR within the range from the upper limit to the lower limit in the claims can be produced. Requirement [2]<br>
The density (d) of the ethylene-based resin [R] of the present invention is within the range of 875 to 970 kg/m3, preferably 885 to 964 kg/m3, more preferably 905 to 960 kg/m3. The density (d) which relates to the present invention is a value obtained by thermally treating a measurement sample at 120°C for 1 hour, then gradually cooling it linearly to room temperature over 1 hour and measuring its density in a density gradient tube.<br>
When the density (d) is 875 kg/m3 or more, the ethylene-based resin has good heat resistance and the surface of a film produced from the ethylene-based resin is less sticky. On the other hand, when the density (d) is 970 kg/m3 or less, the ethylene-based resin<br>
has a good low-temperature sealing property.<br>
Generally, the density depends on the content of a-olefin in the ethylene-based polymer, and as the content of a-olefin is decreased, the density is increased, while the content of a-olefin is increased, the density is decreased. It is known that the content of a-olefin in the ethylene-based polymer is determined by the compositional ratio of a-olefin to ethylene α-olefin/ethylene) in the polymerization system (for example, Walter Kaminsky, Makromol. Chem., 193, p. 606 (1992)). For this reason, in the production of the ethylene-based polymer constituting the ethylene-based resin [R] of the present invention, it is possible to control the density of the polymer by increasing or decreasing a-olefin/ethylene. By such a controlling method, it is possible to make the density of the ethylene-based resin [R] of the present invention satisfy the range of from the lower limit to the upper limit of the claims.<br>
Requirement [3]<br>
The ratio [MT/* (g/P) ] of the melt tension [MT (g) ] at 190°C to the shear viscosity [*(P)] at 200°C at an angular velocity of 1. 0 rad/sec of the ethylene-based resin [R] of the present invention is in the range of l.50xlO-4 to 9.00xl-4, preferably 2.00xlO-4 to 7.00xlO-4 more preferably 2.60xlO-4 to 5-OOxlCT-4. An ethylene-based resin having an MT/* of l.SOxlO-4 or more exhibits good result regarding neck-in.<br>
Production under the conditions described in Example 31<br>
provided later can yield an ethylene-based polymer having an MT/* near the lower limit of claims, whereas production under the conditions described in Example 19 can yield an ethylene-based<br>
polymer having an MT/* near the upper limit of claims.<br>
In the present invention, themelt tension (MT) was determined by measuring the stress upon stretching a molten polymer at a constant speed.  In this measurement, an MT measuring machine manufactured by Toyo Seiki Seisaku-sho, Ltd. was used.  The measurement conditions include a resin temperature of 190°C, a melting time of 6minutes, a barrel diameter of 9. 55 mmo, an extrusion speed of 15 mm/min., a take-up speed of 24 m/min (when a molten filament breaks, the take-up speed is reduced by 5 m/min. ), a nozzle diameter of 2.095 mmo, and a nozzle length of 8 mm.<br>
The shear viscosity () at 200°C at an angular velocity of<br>
1.0 rad/sec was determined by measuring the angular velocity [ω <br>
(rad/sec) ] dispersion of shear viscosity () at a measurement<br>
temperature of 200°C in the range of 0.02512 
measurement, a dynamic stress rheometer SR-5000 manufactured by<br>
Rheometrix was used. As a sample holder, a 25 mmo parallel plate was used, and the sample thickness was about 2.0 mm. 5 points<br>
were measured per digit of co. Distortion was selected suitably in the range of 3 to 10%, which is not to be over torque and could be detected in the measurement range. The sample used in<br>
measurement of shear viscosity was prepared by press-molding the measurement sample to a thickness of 2 mm under the conditions of a preheating temperature of 190°C, a preheating time of 5 minutes, a heating temperature of 190°C, a heating time of 2 minutes, a heating pressure of 100 kg/cm2, a cooling temperature of 20°C, a cooling time of 5 minutes and a cooling pressure of 100 kg/cm2 with a press molding ma chine manufactured by Shinto Metal Industries, Ltd.<br>
Requirement [4]<br>
The sum [(A+B)(/1000C)] of the number of methyl branches [A(/1000C)] and the number of ethyl branches [B(/1000C)] of the ethylene-based resin [R] of the present invention measured by 13C-NMR is 1.8 or less, preferably 1.3 or less, more preferably 0.8 or less, and particularly preferably 0. 5 or less. The number of methyl branches and the number of ethyl branches defined in the present invention is defined in terms of number per 1, 000 carbons as defined later.<br>
It is known that when short branches such as methyl branches, ethyl branches etc. exist in the ethylene-based resin, the short branches are incorporated into crystals to broaden the spacing of the crystal planes, thus lowering the mechanical strength of the resin (for example, Zenjiro Ohsawa et al.: Kobunshi No Jyumyoyosoku To Chojyumyoka Gijyutsu (Estimation of Longevity of Polymer and Techniques of Prolonging Longevity), p. 481, N.T.S<br>
(2002) ) . Accordingly, when the sum (A+B) of the number of methyl branches and the number of ethyl branches is 1.8 or less, the resulting ethylene-based resin is excellent in mechanical strength.<br>
The number of methyl branches and the number of ethyl branches in an ethylene-based resin depend highly on the method of polymerizing the ethylene-based polymer constituting the ethylene-based resin, and an ethylene-based polymer obtained by high-pressure radical polymerization has more methyl and ethyl branches than those in an ethylene-based polymer obtained by coordination polymerization using a Ziegler catalyst system.  In the coordination polymerization, the number of methyl branches and the number of ethyl branches in the ethylene-based polymer depend highly on the compositional ratio among propylene, 1-butene and ethylene (propylene/ethylene, 1-butene/ethylene) in the polymerization system. Accordingly, 1-butene/ethylene is increased or decreased to produce an ethylene-based resin having the sum (A+B) of the number of methyl branches and the number of ethyl branches, which is in the range of the claims.<br>
The number of methyl branches and the number of ethyl branches measured by 13C-NMR are determined as follows.  The measurement was conducted with an integration frequency of 10,000 to 30,000 by using ECP500 nuclear magnetic resonance apparatus (1H: 500MHz) manufactured by JEOL Ltd. As a chemical shift standard, a peak<br>
(29.97 ppm) of main-chain methylene was used. 250 to 400 mg of sample and 3 ml mixture consisting of o-dichlorobenzene (special grade, manufactured by Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.) and benzene-d6 (manufactured by ISOTEC) in the 5:1 ratio (ratio by volume) were introduced into a commercially available quartz glass tube of 10 mm in diameter for NMR measurement, then heated at 120°C and dispersed uniformly. Spectral assignment of each absorption in an NMR spectrum was conducted according to Kagaku no Ryoiki (Chemical Field), extra issue 141, NMR-General Remarks and Experimental Guide [I], pages 132 to 133. The number of methyl branches per 1,000 carbons was calculated from the integrated intensity ratio of the absorption (19.9 ppm) of methyl groups derived from methyl branches to the total integration of absorption observed in the range of 5 to 45 ppm. The number of ethyl branches was calculated from the integratedintensity ratioof the absorption (10.8 ppm) of ethyl groups derived from ethyl branches to the total integration of absorption observed in the range of 5 to 45 ppm.<br>
Requirement [5]<br>
The zero shear viscosity [0(P)] at 200°C and the weight-average molecular weight (Mw) measured by GPC-viscosity detector method (GPC-VISCO) of the ethylene-based resin [R] of the present invention satisfy the following relational expression (Eq-1):<br>
(Equation Removed)Preferably, the following relational expression (Eq-2) is satisfied:<br>
(Equation Removed) (Eq-2) More preferably, the following relational expression (Eq-3) is satisfied:<br>
(Equation Removed) (Eq-3) Particularly preferably, the following relational expression (Eq-4) is satisfied:<br>
(Equation Removed) (Eq-4) It is known that when the zero shear viscosity [O(P)] is log-log plotted with respect to the weight average molecular weight (Mw) , a resin whose elongational viscosity does not show a strain hardening property, like linear ethylene-based polymers having no long-chain branches, follows the power law with a slope of 3.4, whereas a resin whose elongational viscosity shows a strain rate hardening property, like high-pressure low-density polyethylene, shows a zero shear viscosity [o(P) ] lower than the power law (C. Gabriel, H.Munstedt, J. Rheol. , 47 (3) , 619 (2003) ) .  When the zero shear viscosity [0(P)] at 200°C is 4. 5xlO"13xMw3'4 or less, the elongational viscosity of the resulting ethylene-based polymer exhibits strain rate hardening property. Therefore, take-off surging does not occur.<br>
That the ethylene-based resin [R] of the present invention satisfies the above-mentioned relational expression (Eq-1) means<br>
that log(r|o) and logMw are present in the area defined by the following relational expression (Eq-1') when the 0 and Mw of ethylene-based resin [Rl] are log-log plotted.<br>
3. 4Log(Mw)-15.0000 
[o(P)] and the weight average molecular weight (Mw) defined by the above-mentioned parameter inequality expression (Eq-1) is close to the boundary line defined by the following formula (Eq-1' ) included in parameter inequality expressions (Eq-1' ) .  On the other hand, by producing under the conditions described in Example 29, it is possible to obtain an ethylene-based resin which is close to the boundary line defined by the following formula (Eq-1'') included in parameter inequality expressions (Eq-1').<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
The zero shear viscosity [0(P) ] at 200°C was determined in<br>
the following manner. A dispersion of angular velocity [o&gt;<br>
(rad/second) ] of shear viscosity (*) at a measurement temperature<br>
of 200°C is measured within the range of 0.02512 
this measurement, a dynamic stress rheometer SR-5000 manufactured<br>
by Rheometrix was used. As a sample holder, a 25 mmo parallel plate was used, and the sample thickness was about 2. 0 mm. 5 points were measured per digit of ω .  Distortion was selected suitably in the range of 3 to 10%, which is not to be over torque and could be detected in the measurement range. The measurement sample was press-molded to a thickness of 2 mm to prepare the sample used in measurement of shear viscosity under the conditions of a preheating temperature of 190°C, a preheating time of 5 minutes, a heating temperature of 190°C, a heating time of 2 minutes, a heating pressure of 100 kg/cm2, a cooling temperature of 20°C, a cooling time of 5 minutes and a cooling pressure of 100 kg/cm2 with a press molding machine manufactured by Shinto Metal Industries, Ltd.<br>
The zero shear viscosity  o was calculated by fitting the Carreau model of expression (Eq-5) given below to the actually measured rheology curve [a dispersion of angular velocity (ω) of shear viscosity (*) ] by the nonlinear least square method.<br>
(Equation Removed) (Eq-5)<br>

The results are shown in Tables 9 and 10.<br>
Comparative Example 1 fails to satisfy the requirement with respect to MT/* provided in claim 1.  For this reason, the neck-in is greater than those in Examples. [Comparative Example 2]<br>

Product pellets of ethylene/1-octene copolymer (trade name: Affinity PF1140) produced by solution polymerization, commercially available from Dow Chemical Company, were used to prepare a measurement sample to evaluate its physical properties. The results are shown in Table 9.<br>
Comparative Examples 4 and 5 fail to satisfy the requirement<br>
with respect to MT/* provided in claim 1.  For this reason, it is assumed that the neck-in is greater than those of Examples.<br>
Further, it fails to satisfy the requirement of claim 1 with respect<br>
to the relationship between the zero shear viscosity (O) and the weight average molecular weight (Mw). For this reason, unlike Examples, it is assumed that take-off surging will occur.<br>

[Ethylene-based polymer [Rl-1]]<br>
Ethylene-based polymer [Rl-1] was produced by a method same as in Example 1. Using the resulting ethylene-based polymer [Rl-1], a measurement sample was prepared in the same manner as in Example 10. The results of the physical property measurement using this sample are shown in Table 11. [Ethylene-based polymer [R2-1]]<br>
An ethylene/4-methyl-l-pentene copolymer commercially available from Prime Polymer Co., Ltd. (commercial name: ULTZEX UZ15150J) was used as the ethylene-based polymer [R2]. The results of the physical property measurement using the product pellets as a measurement sample are shown in Table 11. [Ethylene-based resin]<br>
An ethylene-based resin was prepared by dry blending ethylene-based polymer [Rl-1] and ethylene-based polymer [R2-1] in a weight ratio: [Rl-1]/[R2-1] = 30/70, and melt kneading the mixture at a resin temperature of 180°C at a revolution number of 50 rpm for 5 minutes in a Laboplast mill manufactured by Toyo Seiki Seisaku-sho, Ltd. This melted polymer was cooled under the conditions of a cooling temperature of 20°C, a cooling time of 5 minutes and a cooling pressure of 100 kg/cm2 with a press-molding ma chine manufactured by Shinto Metal Industries, Ltd. The results of the physical property<br>
measurement using this sample are shown in Table 12.<br>
