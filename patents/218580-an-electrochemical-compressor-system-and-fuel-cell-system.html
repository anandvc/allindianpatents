				<td>		Electrochemical system<br>
		The present invention relates to an electrochemical<br>
		system, such as for example a fuel cell system or an<br>
5		electrochemical compressor system.<br>
		Electrochemical compressor systems may be, for exam-<br>
		ple eleotrolysers, which by applying a potential, in<br>
		addition to producing, for example water and oxygen<br>
10		from water, compress these gases at the same time un-<br>
		der high pressure.<br>
		In addition, electrochemical compressor systems, such<br>
		as for example electrochemical hydrogen compressors,<br>
15		are also known, to which gaseous molecular hydrogen<br>
		is supplied and the latter is compressed electro-<br>
		chemically by applying a potential. This electro-<br>
		chemical compression is available particularly for<br>
		small quantities of hydrogen to be compressed, since<br><br><br>
WO 2004/036677							PCT/EP2003/011347<br>
2<br>
		mechanical compression of hydrogen would be consid-<br>
		erably more expensive here.<br>
		Electrochemical systems are known, in which an elsc-<br>
5		trochemical cell stack is constructed with layering<br>
		of several electrochemical cells, which are separated<br>
		from one another in each case by bipolar plates. The<br>
		bipolar plates thus have several tasks:<br>
10		-	electrical contacting of the electrodes of the<br>
		individual electrochemical cells and conveying the<br>
		current to the adjacent cell series connection of<br>
		the cells, <br>
		-	supplying the cells with reactants, such as for<br>
15		example water or gases and, for example removal of<br>
		the reaction gas produced via an appropriate dis-<br>
		tributor structure,<br>
		-	conveying the heat being produced during genera-<br>
		tion in the electrochemical cell, and<br>
20		-	sealing off of the various media ducts or cool-<br>
		ing ducts with respect to one another and externally.<br>
		The bipolar plates have openings for cooling or media<br>
		supply and media discharge for media supply and media<br>
25		discharge from the bipolar plates to the actual elec-<br>
		trochemical cells (these are for example MEA (Mem-<br>
		brane Electron Assembly) having a gas diffusion<br>
		layer, for example made from a metal mat, orientated<br>
		in each case towards the bipolar plates).<br>
30<br>
		Difficulties regularly result here particularly with<br>
		regard to the gas diffusion layer. It has been con-<br>
		ventional hitherto to design the seal between the bi-<br>
		polar plates or -between bipolar plates and the elec-<br>
35		trochemical cell in that an elastomer seal is placed,<br>
		for example in a groove of the bipolar plate. By ex-<br><br><br>
WO 2004/036677							PCT/EP2003/011347<br>
3<br>
		erting compressive strain (for example by means of<br>
		tension bands) on the electrochemical cell stack,<br>
		pressing of the seal then takes place, as a result of<br>
		which a sealing effect should be achieved for the<br>
5		openings -<br>
		It is now a problem for the inserted gas diffusion<br>
		layer that it may be designed as a fibre mat (with<br>
		metal fibres) or metal mesh. Fibre mats which are<br>
10		conventional in industry have a theoretical thickness<br>
		of, for example l mm, but the manufacturing tolerance<br>
		is + 100 pm. The metal fibres which construct the mat<br>
		are themselves only slightly resilient. In addition,<br>
		it is also not recommended to compensate production<br>
15		tolerances of the fibre mat by compressing the mat,<br>
		since the gas permeability of the mat layer is thus<br>
		severely diminished and hence operation of the elec-<br>
		trochemical cell is restricted. On the other hand<br>
		however, it is necessary to exert a minimum pressure<br>
20		on the entire gas diffusion layer by the bipolar<br>
		plate, so that there is an adequate passage of cur-<br>
		rent through the gas diffusion layer. It can thus be<br>
		summarised that for the current elastomer seals, ei-<br>
		ther a non-perfect seal or non-optimum operation of<br>
25		the electrochemical cell was thus to be accepted. In<br>
		addition, particularly for electrochemical cells op-<br>
		erated using molecular hydrogen, permeation losses of<br>
		H2 occur which diffuse through the elastomer seal,<br>
30		As a first aspect, the object of the present inven-<br>
		tion is therefore to achieve a secure seal of the<br>
		openings in an electrochemical cell stack with as low<br>
		costs as possible.<br>
35		This is achieved by an electrochemical compressor<br>
		system according to the invention.<br><br><br>
WO 2004/0J6677							PCT/EP2003/011347<br>
4<br>
		By providing bead arrangements, which are resilient<br>
		at least in some regions, for sealing the openings, a<br>
		secure seal is achieved over a long resilient path of<br>
5		the bead arrangement. Openings are thus understood to<br>
		mean virtually any region to be sealed in the present<br>
		application. This may be, for example a passage open<br>
		ing for a reaction fluid (for example H2 or water) or<br>
		a cooling agent. However, it may also be, for example<br>
10		the electrochemically active region, in which for ex-<br>
		ample the gas diffusion layer is arranged or screw<br>
		holes are provided. The resilient bead arrangement<br>
		always permits compensation of production tolerances<br>
		of, for example gas diffusion layers, in a wide tol-<br>
15		erance range and nevertheless provision of an optimum<br>
		sealing effect,<br>
		A very advantageous embodiment of the invention en-<br>
		visages that the bead arrangement is designed for mi-<br>
20		crosealing with a thin coating having a thickness be-<br>
		tween 1 pm to 400 pm. The coating is advantageously<br>
		made from an elastomer, such as silicons, viton or<br>
		EPDM (ethylene/propylene-diene terpolymer), applica-<br>
		tion is preferably effected by a screen-printing<br>
25		process, tampon-printing process, spraying or by CIPG<br>
		(cured in place gasket; that is elastomer introduced<br>
		at the site of the seal as liquid which is cured<br>
		there.]. These measures ensure that, for example hy-<br>
		drogen diffusion is reduced to an extremely low de-<br>
30		gree by the seal, since the height of the permeable<br>
		material is adapted to a minimum. Attempts are thus<br>
		made not to recover additional geometric height, but<br>
		only to provide roughness compensation for micro seal-<br>
		ing,<br>
35<br><br>
WO2004/036677							PCT/EP2003/011347<br>
5<br>
		A further advantageous embodiment of the invention <br>
		envisages that the bead arrangement contains a full<br>
		 bead or a half bead. It is thus also possible within<br>
		a bead arrangement to provide both forms, since de-<br>
5		pending on the course of the bead arrangement in the<br>
		plane, other elasticities may prove useful, for exam-<br>
		ple that in narrow radii a different beading geometry<br>
		is useful than for straight courses of the bead ar-<br>
		rangement .<br>
10<br>
		An advantageous development of the bead arrangement<br>
		envisages that the bead arrangement is designed at<br>
		least in some regions as a half bead constructed<br>
		around the electrochemically active region and open<br>
15		around the latter in some regions. It is thus at-<br>
		tached so that it is open towards the high—pressure<br>
		side, thus ensuring that by increasing the internal<br>
		pressure, the increase in contact pressure of the<br>
		bead against the sealing surface of the next bipolar<br>
20		plate (or the membrane lying therebetween) is<br>
		achieved. Since the electrochemical compressor stack<br>
		is stabilised externally by end plates which are held<br>
		together using tension bands or the like, yielding of<br>
		the stacked individual plates is only possible to a<br>
25		limited extent. There is no "elastic expansion" of<br>
		the entire arrangement but only a rise in contact<br>
		force in regions of the seal so that there is even<br>
		self-stabilisation of the seals or of the entire ar-<br>
		rangement. The half bead is thus designed so that by<br>
30		increasing pressure in the system (this internal<br>
		pressure may be over 200 bar, preferably over 700<br>
		bar, particularly preferably over l,000 bar up to<br>
		5,000 bar) in the electrochemically active region,<br>
		surface pressure directed in the direction of the<br>
35		electrochemical compressor stack is increased so that<br>
		tightness problems are excluded and thus a quas<br>
i<br><br>
WO 2004/0366 77							PCT/EP2003/011347<br>
6<br>
		"self-stabilising" system is provided with regard to<br>
		the seal.<br>
		A further advantageous embodiment envisages that the<br>
5		bead arrangement is made from steel. Steel has the<br>
		advantage that it can be processed very cost-<br>
		effectively using conventional tools, in addition,<br>
		for example methods for coating steel with thin elas-<br>
		tomer layers are well tested. The good elasticity<br>
10		properties of steel facilitate the good design of the<br>
		long resilient sealing region of the invention ac-<br>
		cording to the invention. There is thus the particu-<br>
		lar possibility that the bead arrangement is attached<br>
		to the bipolar plate. There is thus firstly the pos-<br>
15		sibility that the bipolar plate is designed as a<br>
		whole as a steel moulding (which is possibly provided<br>
		with a coating for corrosion resistance or conductiv-<br>
		ity in some regions). However, it is also possible<br>
		that the bipolar plate is designed as a composite<br>
20		elment of two steel plates with a plastic plate ly-<br>
		ing therebetween. However, in each case the good<br>
		manufacturing possibilities of steel may be utilised,<br>
		it is possible to make the bead arrangement within a<br>
		manufacturing step which is taking place in any case<br>
25		(for example embossing of a flow field, that is a<br>
		"stream field"). Very low costs are thus produced,<br>
		also no additional sources of error are provided by<br>
		extra components, such as for example additionally<br>
		inserted elastomer seals.<br>
30<br>
		Nevertheless, it is also possible according to the<br>
		invention to provide the bead arrangement made from<br>
		other metals, such as for example steel, nickel, ti-<br>
		tanium or aluminium and alloys thereof. The choice,<br>
35		which metal is to be preferred, thus depends, for ex-<br><br><br>
WO2004/036677							PCT/EP2003/011347<br>
7<br>
		ample also on the required electrical properties or<br>
		the required degree of corrosion resistance.<br>
		It thus becomes possible to adapt the compression<br>
5		characteristic of the bead, for example to a gas dif-<br>
		fusion layer. However, this does not have to apply<br>
		only to gas diffusion layers, the bead line may gen-<br>
		erally be well adapted to components having low elas-<br>
		ticity. The beaded seal can be designed flexibly and<br>
10		hence in addition can be applied well and without<br>
		high retrofitting costs for all producers of electro-<br>
		chemical compressor systems.<br>
		A further advantageous embodiment envisages that the<br>
15		bead arrangement has a stopper, which limits compres-<br>
		sion of the gas diffusion layer to a minimum thick-<br>
		ness. It is thus an incompressible part of the bead<br>
		arrangement or a part, the elasticity of which is<br>
		very much lower than that of the actual bead. This<br>
20		ensures that the degree of deformation is limited in<br>
		the bead region, so that there cannot be complete<br>
		flat pressing of the bead.<br>
		A further advantageous embodiment envisages that the<br>
25		bead arrangement is arranged on a component which is<br>
		separate from the bipolar plate. This is particularly<br>
		favourable when the bipolar plates consist of mate-<br>
		rial which is unsuitable for bead arrangements. The<br>
		separate component is then placed on the bipolar<br>
30		plate or integrated by adhesion, clicking-in, weld-<br>
		ing-in, soldering-in or moulding-in, so that overall<br>
		a sealing connection is produced between the separate<br>
		component and the bipolar plate.<br>
35		Finally, a further advantageous embodiment envisages<br>
		that the bead arrangement is designed from an elas-<br><br><br>
W O/2004/036677							PCT/EP2003/011347<br>

20		ensures that the degree of deformation is limited in<br>

30		plate or integrated by adhesion, clicking-in, weld-<br>
		ing-in, soldering-in or moulding-in, so that overall<br>
		a sealing connection is produced between the separate<br>
		component and the bipolar plate.<br>
35		Finally, a further advantageous embodiment envisages<br>
		that the bead arrangement is designed from an elas-<br><br><br>
WO 2004/036677							PCT/EP2003/011347<br>
8<br>
		tomer roll. Such a bead can be applied by a screen-<br>
		printihg process or tampon printing. It serves both<br>
		for microsealing and for macrosealing. The roll also<br>
		assumes the function of path adaptation on a gas dif-<br>
5		fusion layer.<br>
		A further advantageous development envisages that the<br>
		electrochemical compressor system is designed as an<br>
		electrolyser. Here, water introduced on one side of<br>
10		the electrochemical cell is cleaved electrochemically<br>
		into molecular hydrogen and oxygen. Membranes made<br>
		from Nafion or similar proton-conducting systems are<br>
		used for this, but separators may also be used, which<br>
		contain, for example PTFE foams soaked with potassium<br>
15		hydroxide. Also porous ceramic structures, soaked<br>
		with potassium hydroxide, are possible separators,<br>
		for example structures based on Nextel or also hy-<br>
		droxide-conducting structures. The contact forces<br>
		(surface pressures of the seal in the main direction<br>
20		of the electrochemical cell stack) may lie between<br>
		0.1 and 200 N/mm2 , preferably over 10 N/mm2 , particu-<br>
		larly preferably over 50 N/mm1.<br>
		A further advantageous development envisages that the<br>
25		electrochemical compressor system is a hydrogen com-<br>
		pressor, which oxidises molecular hydrogen introduced<br>
		on the first side of a proton-conducting electro- <br>
		chemical membrane to H+ and reduces it again on the<br>
		second side back to molecular hydrogen, wherein the<br>
30		molecular hydrogen there is subjected to a higher<br>
		pressure on the second side than on the first side<br>
		due to the sealing and spatial anangement. The. oper-<br>
		ating temperature should lie here between 0 and<br>
		1000C, conceivably also 0 - 2000C or 0 - 550°C. Hy-<br>

		tem) consisting of an electrochemical cell stack (or<br>
		a fuel cell stack) having layering of several elec-<br>
		trochemical cells (or fuel cells), which axe sepa-<br>
		rated from one another in each case by bipolar<br>
5		plates, wherein the bipolar plates have openings for<br>
		cooling of media supply and media discharge for the<br>
		electrochemical cells (fuel cells) and the electro-<br>
		chemical cell stack (or fuel cell stack) can be<br>
		placed under mechanical compression strain in the di-<br>
10		rection of the layering, wherein resilient bead ar-<br>
		rangements are provided around the opening of the bi-<br>
		polar plate, wherein perforations for conducting liq-<br>
		uid or gaseous media are arranged an at least one<br>
		flank of the bead arrangements, is thus shown here.<br>
15<br>
		It is thus particularly advantageous that first of<br>
		all sealing of the openings is generally achieved by<br>
		the bead arrangement when applying a mechanical pres-<br>
		sure in the direction of layering of the electro-<br>
20		chemical cell stack, which sealing is cost-effective<br>
		and provides good tolerance compensation. Specific<br>
		supply or discharge of cooling agents into corre-<br>
		sponding cooling agent cavities and also secured me-<br>
		dia supply and media discharge is also additionally<br>
25		facilitated by the perforations in the flanks of the<br>
		bead arrangements. It is no longer necessary that the<br>
		bead has to be completely interrupted in order to<br>
		supply or discharge cooling agents or operating media<br>
		quasi orthogonally to the direction of layering of<br>
30		the eiectrochamical cell stack (which coincides here<br>
		with the direction of an interface duct) . Hence it is<br>
		already possible in the production of these bipolar<br>
		plates to provide the corresponding perforations<br>
		which lead Later to media supply in the finished<br>
35		electrochemical compressor system.. It is thus advan-<br>
		tageous that such perforations can be easily produced<br><br><br>
W O 2004/036677							PCT/EP2003011347<br>
11<br>
		on a large scale, flow resistances and the stiffness<br>
		of the bead arrangement etc. may be preset precisely<br>
		by varying the perforations ,<br>
5		In particular cost-effective production of a bipolar<br>
		plate or of parts of the bipolar plate is possible in<br>
		that a metal plate is provided with holes first of<br>
		all and then mechanical shaping of the perforated<br>
		plate takes place to produce the bead arrangement so<br>
10		that the previously introduced holes are perforations<br>
		in at least one flank of the bead arrangement. Of<br>
		course it is however also possible to first emboss<br>
		the profile of the bipolar plate and then to intro-<br>
		duce the perforations, for example using laser proc-<br>
15		essingr punch supply etc.<br>
		Hence, it may be said by way of summary that the<br>
		value of the invention lies in that simplified media<br>
		supply to the active region of the bipolar plate is<br>
20		possible. "Tunnelling" of a seal is not necessary,<br>
		since the madia supply in this case takes place<br>
		through the sealing system itself. This is firstly<br>
		space-saving and secondly facilitates higher volume<br>
		and weight capacities of the electrochemical cell.<br>
25		The tinvention is available particularly for metallic<br>
		bipolar plates for PEM electrochemical cells, which<br>
		are constructed in most cases from tvo embossed metal<br>
		sheets which are flatly connected to one another. The<br>
		media water, in some cases cooling water, and the<br>
30		gases thus have to be effectively sealed with. respect<br>
		to one another. If the seal of a metallic bipolar<br>
		plate is designed as a bead construction, the bead is<br>
		in most cases severely flattened at the points<br>
		through which media should flow into the active ra-<br>
35		gion. Support for the membrane is not present at<br>
		these points, which may lead to gas leakages ("cross-<br><br><br>
WO 2004/036677							PCT/EPZ2003/011347<br>
42<br>
		over") or to the collapse of the membrane into the <br>
		supply channel. However if perforations are intro-<br>
		duced into the flanks of the bead, and permit the me-<br>
		dia, for example.hydrogen, air, distilled water, to<br>
5		flow transversely through the bead into the flow<br>
		field region of the bipolar plats, the bead is able<br>
		to rest against the membrane uninterrupted. Clean<br>
		sealing of the media flows is thus achieved. The per-<br>
		forations may thus be designed more advantageously as<br>
10		circles or also as ovals In order not to noticeably<br>
		change the spring characteristic of the Dead. Sealing<br>
		between the fluid flows occurring in the electro-<br>
		chemical cell is guaranteed by a design of the second<br>
		metallic plate adapted to the bead construction in<br>
15		the region of media passage. The beads may thus be<br>
		designed as full beads or half beads. Furthermore,<br>
		media, passage may take place through the bead with<br>
		cannected ducts. This is advantageous especially for<br>
		guiding the cooling medium. .It may thus be guided<br>
20		more easily between the anode and the csthode plates.<br>
		A further advantageous development envisages that the<br>
		perforations in the flank plane may have a circular,<br>
		oval or angular cross-section. The flow properties of<br>
25		fluids guided through these perforations may be in-<br>
		flueneeri first of all by this shaping and. the sppro-<br>
		priste number of perforations per flank plane. In ad-<br>
		dition, the. stiffness of the bead arrangement. can.,<br>
		also thus be controlled for stress in the direction<br>
30		of layering of the electrochemical cell stack, since<br>
		the corresponding geometrical moments of inertia are<br>
		also co-influenced by shaping of the perforations.<br>
		A particularly advantageous development envisages<br>
35		that a duct is connected to a perforation,, wherein<br>
		the duct is connected to ths bead interior is<br><br><br>
WO/2004/036677							PCT/EP2003/011347<br>
13<br>
		closed at least towards the bead outer-surface. This<br>
		ensures that the perforations are not guided directly<br>
		from the bead interior to the outside, but that spe-<br>
		cific delivery through a duct, for example in the hy-<br>
5		drogen gap of the bipolar plater is possible; the in-<br>
		troduction of oxygen into the cathode of the electro-<br>
		chemical cell is thus prevented. It is particularly<br>
		advantageous in terms of production technology that<br>
		these ducts may also be co-embossed at the sajne time<br>
10		as embossing of the bipolar plate (when it consists,<br>
		for example of metal), alternatively, of course the<br>
		later or earlier attachment of individual ducts is<br>
		possible.<br>
15		A further development envisages that the perforations<br>
		ate open towards the electrochemically active region<br>
		of the electrochemical cell- This is applied in par-<br>
		ticular to introduce media, such as hydrogen. Of<br>
		course different variants next to one .another st the<br>
20		same time are also possible in a single bipolar<br>
		plate, that is those perforations which are connected<br>
		to ducts and those perforations which have no ducts-<br>
		An industrially particularly promising embodiment en-<br>
25		visages that the bipolar plate is constructed from<br>
		two [metal) plates, which has a cavity lying therebe-<br>
		tween for coding agent and/or passing of media<br>
		gases, such ss H2. The interior of this bipolar plats<br>
		may thus also be divided into segments, for example<br>
30		into those which serve on the one hand for guiding<br>
		cooling agent and on the otner hand for distributing<br>
		media gases. This segmenting may thus be provided by<br>
		connecting regions of the two plates, which are de-<br>
		signed for exampls as a welding or soldering.<br>

20		Figure la shows the construction of an electrochemi-<br>

		trochemical cells form in layers the region of an<br>
		electrochemical cell stack 1 arranged between end<br>
		plates (see Figure lc).<br>
25<br>
		An electrochemical cell 2 with its usual components<br>
		can be seen in Figure 1a and has for example an ion-<br>
		conducting polymer membrane, which is provided in the<br>
		central region 2a with a catalyst layer on both<br>
30		sides. Two bipolar plates 3, between which the poly-<br>
		mer membrane is arranged, are provided in the elec-<br>
		trochemical cell. A gas diffusion layer 9, which has<br>
		dimensions so that it can be accommodated in a recess<br>
		of the bipolsr plate, is also arranged in the region<br>
35		between each bipolar plate and the polymer membrane<br>
		(optionalIy, depending on the fina structuring of the<br><br><br>
WO2001/036677							PCT/EP2003/011347<br>
17<br>
		bipols clate) . In the assembled state of the elec-<br>
		trochemical cell (Figure 1b) , the electrochemically<br>
		active region of the elecrochemical cells, which is<br>
		covered essentially by the gas diffusion layer, is<br>
5		arranged in an essentially closed chamber 10 (this<br>
		corresponds essentially to the recess of the bipolar<br>
		plate mentioned above), which is limited essentially<br>
		annularly laterally by a bead 11, This closed chamber<br>
		IG is gas-tight due to the bead 11, which belongs to<br>
10		a bead arrangement 7 or 7 (see Figures 2aa 2ab,2b).<br>
		passage openings for media supply Sa and for media<br>
		discharge 5b lie within the sealing region and are<br>
		sealed by the bead 11 with respect to further passage<br>
15		openings, for example the passage openings for coal-<br>
		ing 4 (which have a separate bead for sealing, which<br>
		is likewise equipped according to the invention). The<br>
		sealing effect thus takes place on all beads by ex-<br>
		erting pressure on the electrochemical cell stack 1<br>
20		in direction 6 of the layering (see Figure lc) . This<br>
		is effected, for example by means of tension bands<br>
		not shown here. The besd 11 has the advantage that it<br>
		has a large resilient compression region, in which it<br>
		shows an adequate sealing effect. This is particu-<br>
25.		larly advantageous during installation of the gas<br>
		diffusion layer 9, which is, for example made from<br>
		graphite or a metal fibre mat (titanium, stainless<br>
		steel or nickel), which is produced in industry with<br>
		high production tolerances. Adaptation of the bead to<br>
30		the geometry of the gas diffusion layer is possible<br>
		due to the wide resilient region of the bead 11, This<br>
		ensures that on the one hand lateral sealing is pro-<br>
		vided, and on the other hand, both adequate gas dis-<br>
		tribution is provided in the gas diffusion layer<br>
35		plane and in addition the contact pressure in layer-<br>
		ing direction 6 is uniformly and adequately hign in<br><br>
WO/2004/036677							PCT/EP2003/011347<br>
18<br>
		order to achieve uniform stream passage througn the<br>
		gas diffusion pipe. To improve microsealing, the bead<br>
		11 is provided on its outer side with a coating of an<br>
		elastomer, which has been applied, for example by a<br>
5		screen—printing process.<br>
		In order to limit pressing of the gas diffusion<br>
		layer, the bead construction is designed with a. stop-<br>
		per. This stopper, which may be designed as a fold,<br>
10		as a corrugated stopper or even as a trapezium stop-<br>
		per, is dealt with once again in more detail further<br>
		below in the description of Figures 3a to 3d. All<br>
		stoppers are dedicated to the function that they are<br>
		able to limit compression of the bead to a minimum<br>
15		dimension-<br>
		The bipolar plate is designed in the present case as<br>
		a metal moulding. Reference is made to what has al-<br>
		ready been said with regard to the ease of production<br>
20		and the advantage of steel in connection with bead<br>
		arrangements.<br>
		If the bipolar plate is shaped, for example from a<br>
		metal which is not suitable for producing suitable<br>
25		bead geometries with the necessary elasticity, the<br>
		bead region may be designed from a different suitable<br>
		material (for example steel). Connection of the sepa-<br>
		rate bead component to the bipolar plate then takes<br>
		place by joining processes, such as welding, solder-<br>
30		ing, adhesion, riveting, clicking-in. If the bipolar<br>
		plates are made from a material other than metal, for<br>
		example from graphite composite, plastic or graphite,<br>
		the bead region may be designed as a frame from a<br>
		suitable material. The base material of the bipolar<br>
35		plate, which contains the flow field, is connected to<br>
		a bead seal frame containing the beads in gas-tight<br><br>
WO2004/036677							PCT/EP2003/011347<br>
12<br>
		or liquid-tight manner by joining processes, such as<br>
		fusing, moulding-in, welding, soldering, adhesion,<br>
		riveting, clicking-in.<br>
5		figures 2aa and 2ab show embodiments of a bead ar-<br>
		rangement according to the invention. Figure 2aa<br>
		shows a cross-section through the bead arrangement 7<br>
		which is designed as a half bead. The essentially an-<br>
		nular bead 11 encloses the gas diffusion layer 9, as<br>
10		already illustrated in the designs of Figure la. In<br>
		figure 2aa, the bead is designed as a so-called half<br>
		bead, that is for example like a quadrant. Since the<br>
		inner region of the electrochemical cell has to be<br>
		enclosed by a seal, and there are intersections in<br>
15		the region of the media ducta (see Figure 2c) , an al-<br>
		ternating design as full bead or half bead is neces-<br>
		sary. A full bead may thus transfer into two half<br>
		beads, which then in each case have in themselves a<br>
		sealing effect. In addition, the use of a full bead<br>
20		or half bead provides the possibility of adapting the<br>
		elasticity in a wide framework.<br>
		Figure 2aa shows the bead arrangement 7 in the un-<br>
		pressed state, when exerting mechanical compressive<br>
25		strain on the electrochemical cell stack, pressing<br>
		takes place in direction 6, so that the bead arrange-<br>
		ment 7 or the bead 11 forms a gas-tight lateral seal<br>
		for the closed chamber 10 with regard to the gas dif-<br>
		fusion layer.<br>
30<br>
		Figure 2ab shows a further cutout of the bead ar-<br>
		rangement 11. It is designed as a half bead. This<br>
		half bead or bead arrangement in the form of a half.<br>
		bead is connected to a bipolar plate 3 via a welded<br>
35		seam 27. The membrane 2 is placed on the upper side<br>
		of the half bead, which is designed essentially to be<br><br>
WO2004/036677							PCT/EP2003/011347<br>
20<br>
		"S" shaped- The electrochemically active region is<br>
		thus enclosed in. gas-tight manner by the membrane 2,<br>
		the half bead 11 and the bipolar plate, so that an<br>
		internal pressure Pinternal is provided hers. A gas<br>
5		diffusion layer made from metal fibre mat, in this<br>
		case titanium fibre mat, is placed in the electro-<br>
		cbemicelly active region. The helf bead arrangement<br>
		arranged in this way at least in some regions is de-<br>
		signed so that the upper flank of the "S" (see also<br>
10		broad arrow) is pushed upwards due to the increased<br>
		internal pressure Pinternal by a pressure increase in<br>
		the electrochemically active region and thus the sur-<br>
		face pressure in this upper flank of the "S'" is in-<br>
		creased. Since the entire electrochemical cell stack<br>
15		is limited by tension bands to a minimum dimension in<br>
		the overall extension in the direction of the elec-<br>
		trochemical cell stack, there is thus an increase in<br>
		surface pressure here in the region of this flank and<br>
		hence an even better seal, it is a quasi "self-<br>
20		stabilising system".<br>
		Figure 2b shows a further bead arrangement, the bead<br>
		arrangement 7' . The only difference in this arrange-<br>
		ment from that from Figure 2a consists in that here a<br>
25		bead is designed as a full bead (here approximately<br>
		with semi-circular cross-section). There are still<br>
		numerous futher embodiments of the present inven-<br>
		tion. Hence, it is possible to show, for example<br>
		still farther bead geometries than those shown here,<br>
30		multiple beads are also possible. In addition, the<br>
		bead- seal of the invention is possible for all seals<br>
		in ths iegion of the electrochemicaI cell stack to be<br>
		pressed. It is not only possible to seal the electro-<br>
		chemically active region 10 around the gas diffusion<br>
35		layer, but also any passages for gaseous or liquid<br>
		media etc For the seal around the electrochemical<br><br>

		Figure 2c shows a plan view of a further embodiment<br>
		3' of a bipolar plate of the invention. The bead ar-<br>
		rangements can thus be seen in plan view by a broad<br>
		line. The bead arrangements thus serve to seal sev-<br>
10		eral passage openings.<br>
		Figures 1a to 3d show various bead arrangements which<br>
		have in. each case a stopper. This stopper serves to<br>
		limit the deformation of a bead so that it cannot be<br>
15		compressed beyond a certain dimension.<br>
		Hence, Figure 3a shows a single-layer bead arrange-<br>
		ment with a full bead 11", the deformation limit of<br>
		which is reached in direction 15 by a corrugated<br>
20		stopper 29. Figure 3b shows a double-layer bead ar-<br>
		rangeraent, in which a full bead of the upper layer is<br>
		limited in deformation by a folded metal sheet lying<br>
		therebelow (see ref. numeral 34)- Figures 3c and 3d<br>
		show beaa arrangenent in. which at least two full<br>
25		beads are opposite one another and either a. folded.<br>
		sheet (see Figure 3c) or a corrugated sheet (see Fig-<br>
		ure 3d) is provided to limit deformation.<br>
		Figure 4 shows a detailed structure of a cutout of a<br>
30		bipolar plate 3, which has been illustrated above in<br>

		applied in principle to any electrochemical systems,<br>
		that is for example to electrochemical compressor<br>
		systems mentioned above or to fuel cell systems.<br>

		The bipolar plate 3 consists of two metal plates 3a<br>
		and. 3b (the lower plats 3b can be seen in Figure 5b)<br>
		which are arranged one above another. The plate 3a<br>
		(the corresponding case applies to plate 3b) has em-<br>
5		bossed duct structures 17 which extend from the plane<br>
		of the paper upwards. The ducts formed between these<br>
		projections (indicated by small arrows 18, which show<br>
		the direction of the duct course) serve for specific<br>
		passage of gases to the electrochemically active re-<br>
10		gion of the electrochemical cell.<br>
		The opening 5a or 5b is surrounded by a full bead and<br>
		serves to supply media, such as H2 or water, to the<br>
		electrochemically active region. The bead arrangement<br>
15		7 surrounding the opening 5 is thus provided with<br>
		Hole-like perforations 8, which permit supply of me-<br>
		dia through the perforations 9 in. the direction of<br>
		arrows 18.<br>
20		The opening 4 serves to supply cooling liquid to the<br>
		gap between the plates 3a and 3b. The opening 4 is<br>
		surrounded by a bead arrangement 7', Ducts 28, which<br>
		are connected to perforations 8' not shown (see Fig-<br>
		ure 6a) , go from the bead arrangement into the inte-<br>
25		rior of the bipolar plate 3.<br>
		Figure 5a shows a cutout of the upper plate 3a of a<br>
		bipolar plate 3. The bead arrangement 7 is shown in<br>
		cross-section, which surrounds the opening 5a or 5b.<br>
30		The section corresponds to the section line A-A, as<br>
		can be seen in -Figure 4. The bead arrangement 7 shows<br>
		in cross-section a full bead, that is a flank 7b con-<br>
		necting to a flat region (which surrounds the opening<br>
		I and which is rising and. after a horizontal piece a<br>
35		falling flank 7a, which is connected to a further<br>
		horizontal piece. the flanks 7b and 7a thus have cir-<br><br>

		culer perforations 8, the supply of gas, for example<br>
		H2, is indicated by corresponding arrows (they cortex<br>
		sporid to the arrow direction 18 in Figure 4) . Of<br>
		course it is also possible to provide oval or angular<br>
5		perforations or only to provide a half bead, in which<br>
		only a falling flank would be provided starting from<br>
		a horizontal region. The openings 8 are thus open to-<br>
		wards the electrochemically active region 10 of the<br>
		electrochemical cell 2 or the bipolar plate 3, so<br>
10		that a media fluid, such as for example air, H2 or<br>
		water, may pass here In alternative designs, it. is<br>
		of course also possible that only one flank, for ex-<br>
		ample the flank 7a, contains perforations.<br>
15		The plate 3a is made from metal, titanium grade 1, 2,<br>
		or 4 nickel 200, 201. or 601 and contains the beed<br>
		arrangement 7 integrally; highly alloyed steels,<br>
		which are suitable for electrochemical cells, for ex-<br>
		ample 1.45 71, 1.44 04, 1.44 01 ot 1.44 39, are thus<br>
20		provided as metals. They can also be easily processed<br>
		on a large scale.<br>
		Figure 5b shows a bipolar plate 3 in an electrochemi-<br>
		cal cell stack or a fuel cell or an electrochemical<br>
25		compressor system. A cutout around the opening 5 ,<br>
		which is an "interface" duct is shown An electro-<br>
		chemical cell 2 to which in turn bipolar plates (in<br>
		some cases not shown) are connected, is arranged in<br>
		each case above and below the bipolar plate 3 for<br>
30		better i11ustration, the representation of separata<br>
		gas diffusion layers was dispensed with. A gas coming<br>
		through the interface duct passes through the latter<br>
		essentially in direction 19. The main flow direction<br>
		in the interface duct is indicated by the arrow 19,<br>
35		further distribution of the gas in the electrochemi-<br>

		of the bipolar plate 3 and electrochemical cell 2 in<br>
		the direction of arrows 20, and in addition further<br>
		distribution is possible through the cavity 14 due to<br>
		appropriate cavity shape of the bipolar plate. The<br>
5		passage of molecular hydrogen on the other flat side<br>
		of the bipolar plate 3, that is region 21, is also<br>
		possible in crorresponding manner.<br>
		Figure 5b additionally shows, how the cavity 14 is<br>
10		separated from a cavity 13 filled with cooling liquid<br>
		by a joining region 26.<br>
		Figure 6a. shows a cutout of a bead arrangement 7'<br>
		which shows the surrounding region of opening 4 (ac-<br>
15		cording to section B-B) ,<br>
		The bead arrangement 7' has in turn a full bead. This<br>
		full bead has on its flanc 7a' pertoiations 8' to<br>
		which ducts 2B are connected on the outer side of the<br>
20		bead arrangement. These ducts 28 ensure that a con-<br>
		nection is provided with the bead interior and hence<br>
		no gas, which is passed in direction 22, may pass to<br>
		the bead outer surface 35.<br>
25		Figure 6b shows once again a section through a part<br>
		of the electrochemical cell stack, and specifically<br>
		in the region ground an opening 4 (the latter belongs<br>
		to an interface duct for example for cooling agent,<br>
		in this case distilled water)- This water flows gen-<br>
30		erally in direction 23, a part stream is separated<br>
		off in direction 24 to the cavity 13 which, accommo-<br>
		dates the cooling liquid. It is thus possible to see<br>
		well in Figure 6b that faultless passage of the cool-<br>
		ing liquid into, the cavity 13 is provided through the<br>
35		duct 28, which is connected to the perforation 8' ,<br>
		without the region 25 filled with O2 between the<br><br>

		Figure 6c shows once again a detailed view of the re-<br>
5		gion around the opening 4 in plan view. A correspond-<br>
		ingly small cutout of the upper plane 3a of bipolar<br>
		plate 3 is thus shown. It can be seen particularly<br>
		well that the bead arrangement 7' , to the flank 7a'<br>
		of which the ducts 28 are connected, which then guide<br>
10		cooling liquid into the cavity 13. (as it were into<br>
		the plane of the paper) , is provided around the open-<br>
		ing 4.<br>
		The bead arrangements of the invention are provided<br>
15		particularly for when bipolar plates having the re-<br>
		quired tightness can be produced cost-effectively for<br>
		series production with a very high quality standard.<br>
		The construction of the bipolar plates having inte-<br>
		gral bead arrangements is thus provided in particu-<br>
20		lar. It. is thus possible to produce the bead arrange-<br>
		ments integrally from a sheet metal part, for example<br>
		by embossing [for example at the same time for em-<br>
		bossing of the duct structure), very low production<br>
		costs thus result. In particular it is not necessary<br>
25		to adapt additional components for sealing, the posi-<br>

30		plied to the bead arrangements mentioned above to de-<br>

		Figure 7a shows first of ali the different possible<br>
		modifications of beed arrangements in 3D position, by<br>
		way of example. This concerns specific courses fat<br>
		full beads (see for example Fig. 2b with bead ar-<br>
5		rangement 7' or Figs. 5a (bead arrangement 7) or 5a<br>
		(bead arrangement 7') , Corresponding courses are also<br>
		applicable Us full beads, Concerning further details,<br>
		attention is drawn to the above-said.<br>
10		The bead arrangement 33 thus shows a bead of variable<br>
		material thickness. Cross-sections of the bead ar-<br>
		rangement are shown as A-A or B-B [see Fig, 7c) . Here<br>
		A-A shews a material thickness of M2, in cross-<br>
		section B-B a material thickness of M1 is shown. In<br>
15		Fig. 7b f characterises a region which represents the<br>
		shortest distance of two identical points in the re-<br>
		peating structure. As the regions within the repeat-<br>
		ing structures may relate to stiff and less stiff re-<br>
		gions , whose length ratios may be variable, the<br>
20		stiffer region hers is designated "l". (The above<br>
		definition of the frequency also applies to the ar-<br>
		rangements 30 to 32).<br>
		Bead arrangement 32 shows a corrugated course of the<br>
25		bead arrangements. For the corrugated course the fre-<br>
		quency f can also be selected here, likewise the am-<br>
		plitude AMP and the radius R (see Fig, 7b) , wherein<br>
		the pressure distribution or compression stiffness of<br>
		the bipolar plate can be selected due to this corru-<br>
30		gated design.<br>
		The bead arrangement 31 shows a variable bar width<br>
		which may likewise be supplied with any frequency f.<br>
		"Barwidth" is thus understood to mean the outer width<br>
35		of the upper flat section corresponding to the bar<br>
		width "stb" defined in Figure 7c- For the bead ar-<br><br>
