In the invention, tetanus toxoid is used as the carrier protein, even where multiple meningococcal conjugates are administered at the same time and where a patient has previously been exposed to the carrier protein, either in the form of a previous immunogen (e.g. in a DTP vaccine)or as a previous carrier protein (e.g. in a Hib or pneumococcal conjugate vaccine). The invention provides a method for immunising a patient, comprising administering multiple conjugates of meningococcal capsular saccharides, wherein each conjugate comprises a tetanus toxoid carrier protein, and the capsular saccharide, and wherein the patient has been pre-immunised with a tetanus toxoid.</td>

MENINGOCOCCAL CONJUGATE VACCINATION<br>
All documents cited herein are incorporated by reference in their entirety.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
This invention concerns vaccines against Neisseria meningitidis. In particular, it concerns vaccines<br>
based on conjugated capsular saccharides from multiple meningococcal serogroups.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Based on the organism's capsular polysaccharide, twelve serogroups of N.meningitidis have been<br>
identified (A, B, C, H, I, K, L, 29E, W135, X, Y and Z). Group A is the pathogen most often<br>
implicated in epidemic disease in sub-Saharan Africa. Serogroups B and C are responsible for the<br>
vast majority of cases in USA and in most developed countries. Serogroups W135 and Y are<br>
responsible for the remaining cases in USA and developed countries.<br>
A tetravalent vaccine of capsular polysaccharides from serogroups A, C, Y and W135 has been<br>
known for many years [1,2]. Although effective in adolescents and adults, it induces a poor immune<br>
response and short duration of protection and cannot be used in infants [e.g. ref. 3] because<br>
polysaccharides are T cell-independent antigens that induce a weak immune response which cannot<br>
be boosted. The polysaccharides in this vaccine are not conjugated [4].<br>
Conjugate vaccines against serogroup C have been approved for human use, and include<br>
Menjugate™ [5], Meningitec™ and NeisVac-C™. Mixtures of conjugates from serogroups A+C are<br>
known [6-8] and mixtures of conjugates from serogroups A+C+W135+Y have been reported [9-13].<br>
While meningococcal conjugates are well known, they have not yet been fitted into existing pediatric<br>
immunisation schedules, which for developed countries typically involve: hepatitis B vaccine at<br>
birth; and, starting at 2 months, all of diphtheria/tetanus/pertussis (D-T-P), H. influenzae type b (Hib)<br>
conjugate, inactivated poliovirus and pneumococcus conjugates at 2 months.<br>
When adding conjugated vaccines to existing immunisation schedules, however, the issue of<br>
carrier-induced epitopic suppression (or "carrier suppression", as it is generally known) must be<br>
addressed, particularly suppression arising from carrier priming. "Carrier suppression" is the<br>
phenomenon whereby pre-immunisation of an animal with a carrier protein prevents it from later<br>
eliciting an immune response against a new antigenic epitope that is presented on that carrier [14].<br>
As reported in reference 15, where several vaccine antigens contain the same protein component<br>
(being used as an immunogen and/or as a carrier protein in a conjugate) then there is the potential for<br>
interference between those antigens. In reference 15, the immune response against an antigen that<br>
was conjugated to a tetanus toxoid (Tt) carrier was suppressed by pre-existing immunity against Tt.<br>
Reference 16 reports how a combination of D-T-P vaccines with a Hib conjugate vaccine was<br>
adversely affected where the carrier for the Hib conjugate was the same as the tetanus antigen from<br>
the D-T-P vaccine. The authors concludes that this "carrier suppression" phenomenon, arising from<br>
-1-<br><br>
WO 2006/075170	PCT/GB2006/000120<br>
interference by a common protein carrier, should be taken into account when introducing vaccines<br>
that include multiple conjugates.<br>
In contrast to references 15 and 16, reference 17 reported that priming with tetanus toxoid had no<br>
negative impact on the immune response against a subsequently-administered Hib-Tt conjugate, but<br>
suppression was seen in patients with maternally acquired anti-Tt antibodies. In reference 18,<br>
however, an "epitopic suppression" effect was reported for a Tt-based peptide conjugate in patients<br>
having existing anti-Tt antibodies resulting from tetanus vaccination.<br>
In reference 19, it was suggested that a conjugate having CRM197 (a detoxified mutant of diphtheria<br>
toxin) as the carrier may be ineffective in children that had not previously received diphtheria toxin<br>
as part of a vaccine (e.g. as part of a D-T-P or D-T vaccine). This work was further developed in<br>
reference 20, where a carrier priming effect by D-T immunisation was seen to persist for subsequent<br>
immunisation with Hib conjugates.<br>
In reference 21, the authors found that pre-immunisation with a diphtheria or tetanus toxoid carrier<br>
protein reduced the increase in anti-Hib antibody levels after a subsequent immunisation with the Hib<br>
capsular saccharide conjugated to those carriers, with IgG1 and IgG2 being equally affected.<br>
Responses to the carrier portions of the conjugates were also suppressed. Furthermore, a more<br>
general non-epitope-specific suppression was seen, as pre-immunisation with one conjugate was seen<br>
to affect immune responses against both the carrier and saccharide portions of a second conjugate<br>
that was administered four weeks later.<br>
The use of different carrier proteins in a single multivalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine is<br>
reported in reference 22, with multiple carriers being used in order to avoid carrier suppression. The<br>
authors predict that there is a maximum load of a carrier protein that can be tolerated in a multivalent<br>
conjugate vaccine without giving rise to negative interference. In reference 23 it was reported that<br>
pneumococcal conjugate vaccines including mixed carrier proteins elicited, in parallel to the<br>
anti-pneumococcus response, unintentional booster responses to the carriers.<br>
In reference 24, an investigation of whether diphtheria and tetanus boosters could be administered<br>
with monovalent meningococcal serogroup C conjugates, it was found that titres against the<br>
meningococcal conjugate were reduced where the carrier was tetanus toxoid carrier and the patient<br>
had received prior immunisation with a tetanus-containing vaccine.<br>
Finally, reference 25 reports that "prior exposure to the carrier protein can either enhance or suppress<br>
antibody response to polysaccharides administered in saccharide-protein conjugates". The conjugates<br>
used in reference 25 used tetanus toxoid or the CRM197 mutant as the carrier protein.<br>
The situation concerning carrier priming and/or suppression is thus confused, and it remains unclear<br>
whether any particular conjugate will suffer from carrier suppression or will benefit from a carrier<br>
priming enhancement. Meningococcal conjugate vaccines will not be in a position to be integrated<br>
into or added to existing pediatric immunisation schedules until this issue is addressed. Furthermore,<br>
-2-<br><br>
WO 2006/075170	PCT/GB2006/000120<br>
as meningococcal conjugates are to be administered as tetravalent mixtures (i.e. four different<br>
conjugates) then the potential for carrier suppression becomes even more of a risk.<br>
In addition to the problem of priming with a carrier having a negative impact on immune responses<br>
against saccharide conjugates, the reverse can also occur i.e. immunisation with a conjugate can have<br>
a negative impact on immune responses against the carrier [26].<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
Reference 27 suggests that carrier suppression in meningococcal conjugate vaccines should be dealt<br>
with by using more than one type of carrier protein. In particular, reference 27 suggests that<br>
H.influenzae protein D should be used as the carrier protein for meningococcal conjugates, with<br>
tetanus toxoid (Tt) also being a possibility. To avoid epitope suppression, protein D is also the carrier<br>
of choice in reference 28. Similarly, reference 29 suggests that Bordetella pertussis fimbriae should<br>
be used as the carrier in order to avoid carrier suppression in multivalent conjugate vaccines. In<br>
contrast, the invention uses tetanus toxoid (Tt) as the carrier for mixed meningococcal saccharide<br>
conjugates.<br>
Moreover, reference 27 also suggests that meningococcal conjugate vaccines should be administered<br>
at the same time as D-T-P-Hib vaccines (e.g. see example 3), such that there is no previous exposure<br>
to the carrier protein from the meningococcal conjugates. In contrast, it has now been found that<br>
meningococcal conjugates can be administered to patients even where they have already received the<br>
carrier protein, either in the form of a previous immunogen (e.g. in a D-T-P or a D-T immunisation)<br>
or as a previous carrier protein (e.g. in a Hib conjugate or pneumococcal conjugate vaccine). The<br>
previous study of carrier-induced epitopic suppression in monovalent serogroup C conjugate<br>
vaccines [24] did not look at the effect of any prior administration of conjugates.<br>
As well as contrasting with reference 27, the ability of a patient to raise an immune response against<br>
a meningococcal conjugate, even where they have already received a different conjugate, contrasts<br>
with reference 21.<br>
Thus the invention provides a method for immunising a patient against a disease caused by Neisseria<br>
meningitidis, comprising the step of administering to the patient a composition that comprises at least<br>
two of: (a) a conjugate of (i) the capsular saccharide of serogroup A N.meningitidis and (ii) a tetanus<br>
toxoid; (b) a conjugate of (i) the capsular saccharide of serogroup C N.meningitidis and (ii) a tetanus<br>
toxoid; (c) a conjugate of (i) the capsular saccharide of serogroup W135 N.meningitidis and (ii) a<br>
tetanus toxoid; and (d) a conjugate of (i) the capsular saccharide of serogroup Y N.meningitidis and<br>
(ii) a tetanus toxoid, wherein the patient has been pre-immunised with (a) a tetanus toxoid and/or<br>
(b) a conjugate of (i) a capsular saccharide of an organism other than N.meningitidis and (ii) a tetanus<br>
toxoid.<br>
The invention also provides the use of at least two of: (a) a conjugate of (i) the capsular saccharide of<br>
serogroup A N.meningitidis and (ii) a tetanus toxoid; (b) a conjugate of (i) the capsular saccharide of<br>
-3-<br><br>
WO 2006/075170	PCT/GB2006/000120<br>
serogroup C N.meningitidis and (ii) a tetanus toxoid; (c) a conjugate of (i) the capsular saccharide of<br>
serogroup W135 N.meningitidis and (ii) a tetanus toxoid; and (d) a conjugate of (i) the capsular<br>
saccharide of serogroup Y N.meningitidis and (ii) a tetanus toxoid, in the manufacture of a<br>
medicament for immunising a patient against a disease caused by Neisseria meningitidis, wherein the<br>
patient has been pre-immunised with (a) a tetanus toxoid and/or (b) a conjugate of (i) a capsular<br>
saccharide of an organism other than N.meningitidis and (ii) a tetanus toxoid.<br>
The meningococcal disease is preferably meningitis, more preferably bacterial meningitis, and most<br>
preferably meningococcal meningitis. Thus the invention can be used to protect against<br>
meningococcal infections that cause meningitis.<br>
The pre-immunised patient<br>
The patient to be immunised has been pre-immunised with: (a) a tetanus toxoid; and/or (b) a<br>
conjugate of (i) a capsular saccharide of an organism other than Neisseria meningitidis and (ii) a<br>
tetanus toxoid. Typical pre-immunisation will have included: a tetanus toxoid antigen; a Hib capsular<br>
saccharide conjugate using a tetanus toxoid carrier; and/or a pneumococcal capsular saccharide<br>
conjugate using a tetanus toxoid carrier.<br>
The patient will have received at least one (e.g. 1, 2, 3 or more) dose of the pre-immuriisation<br>
antigen(s), and that dose (or the earliest of multiple doses) will have been administered to the patient<br>
at least six (e.g. 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 36, 48, 60, 120, 180, 240, 300 or more) months before the<br>
immunisation with the meningococcal conjugates according to the invention. In a preferred group of<br>
patients, the pre-immunisation took place within 3 years of birth e.g. within 2 years of birth, within 1<br>
year of birth, within 6 months of birth, or even within 3 months, 2 months or 1 month of birth.<br>
The patient to be immunised according to the invention will typically be a human. The human will<br>
generally be at least 1 month old e.g. at least 2 months old, at least 3 months old, at least 4 months<br>
old, at least 6 months old, at least 2 years old, at least 5 years old, at least 11 years old, at least 17<br>
years old, at least 40 years old, at least 55 years old, etc. A preferred set of patients is at least 6<br>
months old. Another preferred set of patients is in the age group 2-55 years old, and another<br>
preferred set of patients is in the age group 11-55 years old. A further preferred set of patients is less<br>
than 11 years old e.g. 2-11 years old. In all cases, however, regardless of age, the patient will have<br>
been pre-immunised as defined herein.<br>
The patient will typically have received a tetanus toxoid as the 'T' antigen in a D-T-P or a D-T<br>
pre-immunisation. Such immunisations are typically given to newborn children at ages 2, 3, and 4<br>
months. Where the immunisation includes a pertussis vaccine, that vaccine may be a whole cell or<br>
cellular pertussis vaccine ('Pw'), but is preferably an acellular pertussis vaccine ('Pa').<br>
Pre-immunisation Pa vaccines will generally include one, two or three of the following well-known<br>
and well-characterised B.pertussis antigens: (1) pertussis toxoid ('PT'), detoxified either by chemical<br>
means or by site-directed mutagenesis e.g. the '9K/129G' mutant [30]; (2) filamentous<br>
-4-<br><br>
WO 2006/075170	PCT/GB2006/000120<br>
haemagglutinin ('FHA'); (3) pertactin (also known as '69 kiloDalton outer membrane protein').<br>
Acellular pertussis vaccines may also include agglutinogen 2 and/or agglutinogen 3. The 'D' antigen<br>
in a D-T-P pre-immunisation is typically a diphtheria toxoid.<br>
The patient may also or alternatively have received the tetanus toxoid as the carrier protein of a<br>
protein-saccharide conjugate. Such conjugates include the 'PRP-T' Hib conjugate [see Table 14-7 of<br>
ref. 31] e.g. the ActfflB™, OmniHIB™ and HIBERIX™ products. The patient may also have been<br>
pre-immunised with a serogroup C meningococcal ('MenC') conjugate. MenC conjugates that use a<br>
tetanus toxoid carrier include the NeisVac-C™ product. Preferably, however, the patient has been<br>
pre-immunised with Hib and/or pneumococcal conjugate, but not with a MenC conjugate. If the<br>
patient has been pre-immunised with a MenC conjugate then the vaccine administered according to<br>
the invention may or may not include a serogroup C conjugate.<br>
Where pre-immunisation was with a conjugated antigen then the patient will almost inevitably have<br>
also received a small amount of free tetanus toxoid as a result of low-level contamination of the<br>
conjugate (e.g. caused by hydrolysis of the conjugate during storage), but this small amount will not<br>
typically have been adequate to provide a significant immune response.<br>
Tetanus toxoid is a well known and well characterised protein [e.g. see chapter 13 of ref. 31] mat can<br>
be obtained by inactivation of the endopeptidase ('tetanus toxin') produced by Clostridium tetani.<br>
The toxin can be treated to give a toxoid that is no longer toxic but that remains antigenic and is able<br>
to stimulate the production of specific anti-toxin antibodies after injection. Preferred tetanus toxoids<br>
are those prepared by formaldehyde treatment. The tetanus toxoid can be obtained by growing<br>
C. tetani in growth medium (e.g. a Latham medium derived from bovine casein), followed by<br>
formaldehyde treatment, ultrafiltration and precipitation. The material may then be treated by a<br>
process comprising sterile filtration and/or dialysis. The term 'tetanus toxoid' as used herein includes<br>
derivatives of tetanus toxoid that remain immunologically cross-reactive with tetanus toxin.<br>
The result of the pre-immunisation is that the patient's immune system has been exposed to the<br>
pre-immunisation antigens. This generally means that the patient will have raised an anti-Tt antibody<br>
response (typically to give an anti-Tt titer &gt;0.01 IU/ml) and will possess memory B and/or T<br>
lymphocytes specific for Tt i.e. pre-immunisation is typically adequate to elicit an anamnestic anti-Tt<br>
immune response in the patient. For pre-immunisation where Tt is a carrier for a saccharide within a<br>
conjugate then the pre-immunisation will have raised an anti-saccharide response and the patient will<br>
possess memory B and/or T lymphocytes specific for the saccharide i.e. the pre-immunisation is<br>
typically adequate to elicit an anamnestic anti-saccharide immune response in the patient. The<br>
pre-immunisation was preferably adequate to elicit protective immunity in the patient e.g. against<br>
tetanus disease or against the saccharide-containing organism, respectively.<br>
Thus the patients to be immunised according to the invention are distinct from patients in general, as<br>
they are members of a subset of the general population whose immune systems have already<br>
mounted an immune response to the pre-immunisation antigens, such that immunisation according to<br>
-5-<br><br>
WO 2006/075170	PCT/GB2006/000120<br>
the invention with a meningococcal conjugate that includes a tetanus toxoid carrier elicits a different<br>
immune response in the subset than in patients who have not previously mounted an immune<br>
response to the pre-immunisation antigens. Patients who have been pre-immunised with Tt as the<br>
carrier of a conjugate (particularly of a Hib conjugate) are preferred. Particularly preferred patients<br>
have been pre-immunised with Tt as the carrier of a conjugate and also with Tt as an unconjugated<br>
immunogen.<br>
As well as having been pre-immunised with a tetanus toxoid, in conjugated or non-conjugated form,<br>
the patient may have been pre-immunised with other antigens. Such antigens include, but are not<br>
limited to: pertussis antigen(s) - see above; diphtheria toxoid - see above; Haemophilus influenzae<br>
type B - see above; hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg); poliovirus, such as an inactivated<br>
poliovirus vaccine (EPV); Streptococcus pneumoniae - see above; influenza virus; BCG; hepatitis A<br>
virus antigens; measles virus; mumps virus; rubella virus; varicella virus; etc.<br>
The patient may or may not have been pre-immunised with one or more meningococcal conjugate(s).<br>
In some preferred embodiments, at the time when a patient first receives a meningococcal conjugate,<br>
they have already been pre-immunised with Tt. In other embodiments, a meningococcal conjugate is<br>
administered to a patient who has already been pre-immunised with both (i) Tt and (ii) a<br>
meningococcal conjugate.<br>
The conjugates<br>
The invention immunises patients with conjugated saccharides. Conjugation is used to enhance the<br>
immunogenicity of saccharides, as it converts them from T-independent antigens to T-dependent<br>
antigens, thus allowing priming for immunological memory. Conjugation is particularly useful for<br>
pediatric vaccines [e.g. ref. 32] and is a well known technique [e.g. reviewed in refs. 33 to 41].<br>
The composition used according to the invention comprises at least two meningococcal conjugates,<br>
wherein each conjugate comprises a tetanus toxoid (or derivative thereof) carrier protein, and the<br>
capsular saccharide. The capsular saccharides are chosen from meningococcal serogroups A, C,<br>
W135 and Y, such that the compositions include saccharides from 2, 3, or all 4 of these four<br>
serogroups. Specific compositions comprise saccharides from: serogroups A &amp; C; serogroups A &amp;<br>
W135; serogroups A &amp; Y; serogroups C &amp; W135; serogroups C &amp; Y; serogroups W135 &amp; Y;<br>
serogroups A &amp; C &amp; W135; serogroups A &amp; C &amp; Y; serogroups A &amp; W135 &amp; Y; serogroups C &amp;<br>
W135 &amp; Y; serogroups A &amp; C &amp; W135 &amp; Y. Compositions including saccharides from all four<br>
serogroups are most preferred.<br>
The capsular saccharides of each of these four serogroups are well characterised. The capsular<br>
saccharide of serogroup A meningococcus is a homopolymer of (a1®6)-linked N-acetyl-D-<br>
mannosamine-1-phosphate, with partial O-acetylation in the C3 and C4 positions. The acetyl groups<br>
can be replaced with blocking groups to prevent hydrolysis [42], and such modified saccharides are<br>
still serogroup A saccharides within the meaning of the present invention. The serogroup C capsular<br>
-6-<br><br>
WO 2006/075170	PCT/GB2006/000120<br>
saccharide is a homopolymer of (a 2®9)-linked sialic acid (N-acetyl neuraminic acid, or 'NeuNAc').<br>
Most serogroup C strains have O-acetyl groups at C-7 and/or C-8 of the sialic acid residues, but<br>
about 15% of clinical isolates lack these O-acetyl groups [43,44]. The saccharide structure is written<br>
as ®9)-Neu p NAc 7/8 OAc-(a2® . The serogroup W135 saccharide is a polymer of sialic acid-<br>
galactose disaccharide units. Like the serogroup C saccharide, it has variable O-acetylation, but at<br>
sialic acid 7 and 9 positions [45]. The structure is written as: ®4)-D-Neup5Ac(7/90Ac)-a-(2®6)-<br>
D-Gal-a-(l®. The serogroup Y saccharide is similar to the serogroup W135 saccharide, except that<br>
the disaccharide repeating unit includes glucose instead of galactose. Like serogroup W135, it has<br>
variable O-acetylation at sialic acid 7 and 9 positions [45]. The serogroup Y structure is written as:<br>
®4)-D-Neup5Ac(7/90Ac)-a-(2®6)-D-Glc-a-(l®.<br>
The saccharides used according to the invention may be O-acetylated as described above (e.g. with<br>
the same O-acetylation pattern as seen in native capsular saccharides), or they may be partially or<br>
totally de-O-acetylated at one or more positions of the saccharide rings, or they may be<br>
hyper-O-acetylated relative to the native capsular saccharides.<br>
The saccharides used according to the invention are preferably shorter than the native capsular<br>
saccharides seen in bacteria. Thus the saccharides are preferably depolymerised, with<br>
depolymerisation occurring after purification but before conjugation. Depolymerisation reduces the<br>
chain length of the saccharides. A preferred depolymerisation method involves the use of hydrogen<br>
peroxide [9]. Hydrogen peroxide is added to a saccharide (e.g. to give a final H2O2 concentration of<br>
1%), and the mixture is then incubated (e.g. at about 55°C) until a desired chain length reduction has<br>
been achieved. Another depolymerisation method involves acid hydrolysis [10]. Other<br>
depolymerisation methods are known to the skilled person. The saccharides used to prepare<br>
conjugates for use according to the invention may be obtainable by any of these depolymerisation<br>
methods. Depolymerisation can be used in order to provide an optimum chain length for<br>
immunogenicity and/or to reduce chain length for physical manageability of the saccharides.<br>
Typical carrier proteins for use in conjugates are bacterial toxins or toxoids, such as diphtheria toxin<br>
(or its CRM197 mutant) and tetanus toxin. Other known carrier proteins include the N.meningitidis<br>
outer membrane protein, synthetic peptides, heat shock proteins, pertussis proteins, cytokines,<br>
lymphokines, hormones, growth factors, artificial proteins comprising multiple human CD4+ T cell<br>
epitopes from various pathogen-derived antigens, protein D from H.influenzae, pneumococcal<br>
surface protein PspA, iron-uptake proteins, toxin A or B from C.difflcile, etc. According to the<br>
invention, however, the meningococcal conjugates include a tetanus toxoid carrier protein. Covalent<br>
conjugation is preferred.<br>
It is possible to use more than one carrier protein in the compositions. Thus different carrier proteins<br>
can be used for different serogroups e.g. serogroup A saccharides might be conjugated to Tt while<br>
serogroup C saccharides might be conjugated to Dt. It is also possible to use more than one carrier<br>
protein for a particular saccharide antigen e.g. serogroup A saccharides might be in two groups, with<br>
-7-<br><br>
WO 2006/075170	PCT/GB2006/000120<br>
some conjugated to Tt and others conjugated to Dt. In general, however, it is preferred to use the<br>
same carrier protein for all meningococcal saccharides in the composition, and more preferably for<br>
all saccharides (i.e. including any non-meningococcal conjugates that may be present). It is preferred<br>
that compositions of the invention do not include any diphtheria toxoid carrier protein.<br>
A single carrier protein might carry more than one saccharide antigen [46]. For example, a single<br>
carrier protein might have conjugated to it saccharides from serogroups A and C. To achieve this<br>
goal, saccharides can be mixed prior to the conjugation reaction. In general, however, it is preferred<br>
to have separate conjugates for each serogroup. Conjugates are preferably mixed to give substantially<br>
a 1:1:1:1 ratio (measured as mass of saccharide) e.g. the mass of each serogroup's saccharide is<br>
within ±10% of each other. A typical quantity of meningococcal antigen per serogroup in a<br>
composition is between lmg and 20mg e.g. between 2 and 10 mg per serogroup, or about 4mg. As an<br>
alternative to a 1:1:1:1 ratio, a double serogroup A dose may be used (2:1:1:1).<br>
Conjugates with a saccharide:protein ratio (w/w) of between 1:15 (i.e. excess protein) and 15:1 (i.e.<br>
excess saccharide), preferably between 1:10 and 10:1, more preferably between 1:5 and 5:1, are<br>
preferred. Excess carrier protein is preferred. Conjugates with saccharide:protein ratio of about 1:12<br>
or about 1:6 or about 1:3 are preferred.<br>
Conjugates may be used in conjunction with free carrier protein [47]. When a given carrier protein is<br>
present in both free and conjugated form in a composition of the invention, however, the<br>
unconjugated form is preferably no more than 5% of the total amount of the carrier protein in the<br>
composition as a whole, and more preferably present at less than 2% by weight. Similarly,<br>
unconjugated saccharide is preferably no more than 15% by weight of the total amount of saccharide.<br>
Any suitable conjugation reaction can be used, with any suitable linker where necessary.<br>
The saccharide will typically be activated or functionalised prior to conjugation. Activation may<br>
involve, for example, cyanylating reagents such as CDAP (e.g. l-cyano-4-dimethylamino pyridinium<br>
tetrafluoroborate [48, 49, etc.]). Other suitable techniques use carbodiimides, hydrazides, active<br>
esters, norborane, p-nitrobenzoic acid, N-hydroxysuccinimide, S-NHS, EDC, TSTU; see also the<br>
introduction to reference 39).<br>
Linkages via a linker group may be made using any known procedure, for example, the procedures<br>
described in references 50 and 51. One type of linkage involves reductive animation of the<br>
polysaccharide, coupling the resulting amino group with one end of an adipic acid linker group, and<br>
then coupling a protein to the other end of the adipic acid linker group [37, 52, 53]. Other linkers<br>
include B-propionamido [54], nitrophenyl-ethylamine [55], haloacyl halides [56], glycosidic linkages<br>
[57], 6-aminocaproic acid [58], ADH [59], C4 to C12 moieties [60] etc. As an alternative to using a<br>
linker, direct linkage can be used. Direct linkages to the protein may comprise oxidation of the<br>
-8-<br><br>
WO 2006/075170	PCT/GB2006/000120<br>
polysaccharide followed by reductive amination with the protein, as described in, for example,<br>
references 61 and 62.<br>
A process involving the introduction of amino groups into the saccharide (e.g. by replacing terminal<br>
=O groups with -NH2) followed by derivatisation with an adipic diester (e.g. adipic acid<br>
N-hydroxysuccinimido diester) and reaction with carrier protein is preferred.<br>
In one preferred conjugation method, a saccharide is reacted with adipic acid dihydrazide. For<br>
serogroup A, carbodiimide may also be added at this stage. After a reaction period, sodium<br>
cyanoborohydride is added. Derivatised saccharide can then be prepared e.g. by ultrafiltration. The<br>
derivatized saccharide is then mixed with carrier protein (e.g. with a tetanus toxoid), and<br>
carbodiimide is added. After a reaction period, the conjugate can be recovered. Further details of this<br>
conjugation method can be found in reference 10. Conjugates obtainable by this method are preferred<br>
conjugates for use according to the invention e.g. conjugates comprising a tetanus toxoid carrier and<br>
an adipic acid linker.<br>
Conjugates are preferably prepared separately and then mixed. After mixing, the concentration of the<br>
mixed conjugates can be adjusted e.g. with sterile pyrogen-free, phosphate-buffered saline. Each<br>
conjugate, before mixing, preferably contains no more than 15mg of carrier.<br>
The result of administering meningococcal conjugates according to the invention is preferably that,<br>
for each administered serogroup, the patient raises a serum bactericidal antibody (SBA) response,<br>
with the increase in SBA titre (compared to the pre-immunised patient before receiving the mixed<br>
meningococcal conjugates) being at least 4-fold, and preferably at least 8-fold, The SBA test is a<br>
standard correlate for meningococcal protection. Further details of serologic correlates for<br>
meningococcal vaccines are given in reference 63.<br>
Further antigenic components of compositions used according to the invention<br>
In addition to meningococcal conjugates, compositions used according to the invention may<br>
optionally include 1, 2 or 3 of the following further antigens:<br>
1.	A conjugated capsular saccharide from S.pneumoniae [e.g. chapter 23 of ref. 31; refs. 64-66].<br>
It is preferred to include saccharides from more than one serotype of S.pneumoniae. For example,<br>
mixtures of polysaccharides from 23 different serotype are widely used, as are conjugate<br>
vaccines with polysaccharides from between 5 and 11 different serotypes [67]. For example,<br>
PrevNar™ [68] contains antigens from seven serotypes (4, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F, and 23F) with<br>
each saccharide individually conjugated to CRM197 by reductive amination, with 2mg of each<br>
saccharide per 0.5ml dose (4mg of serotype 6B), and with conjugates adsorbed on an aluminium<br>
phosphate adjuvant. Where pneumococcal conjugates are included in a compositions for use with<br>
the invention, the composition preferably includes at least serotypes 6B, 14,19F and 23F.<br>
2.	A conjugated capsular saccharide from H.influenzae B [e.g. chapter 14 of ref. 31].<br>
-9-<br><br>
WO 2006/075170	PCT/GB2006/000120<br>
The carrier protein for the conjugate may be a tetanus toxoid, CRM197, Dt or an outer membrane<br>
complex of N.meningitidis. The saccharide moiety of the conjugate may be a polysaccharide<br>
(e.g. full-length polyribosylribitol phosphate (PRP)), but it is preferred to depolymerise the<br>
capsular polysaccharides to form oligosaccharides (e.g. MW from ~1 to ~5 kDa). A preferred<br>
Hib conjugate comprises an oligosaccharide covalently linked to CRM197 or Tt via an adipic<br>
acid linker [69,70]. Administration of the Hib antigen preferably results in an anti-PRP antibody<br>
concentration of &gt;0.15mg/ml, and more preferably &gt;1 mg/ml. Where a composition includes a Hib<br>
saccharide antigen, it preferably does not also include an aluminium hydroxide adjuvant. If the<br>
composition includes an aluminium phosphate adjuvant then the Hib antigen may be adsorbed to<br>
the adjuvant [71] or it may be non-adsorbed [27]. Prevention of adsorption can be achieved by<br>
selecting the correct pH during antigen/adjuvant mixing, an adjuvant with an appropriate point of<br>
zero charge, and an appropriate order of mixing for the various different antigens in a<br>
composition [72].<br>
3. A protein antigen from Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B [e.g. ref. 73].<br>
The composition may comprise one or more of these further antigens.<br>
Such antigens may or may not be adsorbed to an aluminium salt.<br>
If meningococcal conjugates are being administered in a series of doses then none, some or all of the<br>
doses may include these extra antigens.<br>
Compositions containing the meningococcal conjugates preferably do not include diphtheria toxoid.<br>
They preferably do not include pertussis antigens. They preferably do not include hepatitis B virus<br>
surface antigen. They preferably do not include poliovirus. A composition preferably contains no<br>
more than 50mg of tetanus toxoid per meningococcal conjugate, and more preferably no more than<br>
50mg of tetanus toxoid for all meningococcal conjugates combined.<br>
The vaccine composition<br>
The composition used according to the invention will typically include a pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
carrier. Such carriers include any carrier that does not itself induce the production of antibodies<br>
harmful to the individual receiving the composition. Suitable carriers are typically large, slowly<br>
metabolised macromolecules such as proteins, polysaccharides, polylactic acids, polyglycolic acids,<br>
polymeric amino acids, amino acid copolymers, sucrose, trehalose, lactose, and lipid aggregates<br>
(such as oil droplets or liposomes). Such carriers are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
The vaccines may also contain diluents, such as water, saline, glycerol, etc. Additionally, auxiliary<br>
substances, such as wetting or emulsifying agents, pH buffering substances, and the like, may be<br>
present. Sterile pyrogen-free, phosphate-buffered physiologic saline is a typical carrier. A thorough<br>
discussion of pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and excipients is available in reference 74.<br>
Compositions used according to the invention may include an antimicrobial, particularly if packaged<br>
in a multiple dose format.<br>
-10-<br><br>
WO 2006/075170	PCT/GB2006/000120<br>
Compositions used according to the invention may comprise detergent e.g. a Tween (polysorbate),<br>
such as Tween 80. Detergents are generally present at low levels e.g. 
Compositions used according to the invention may include sodium salts (e.g. sodium chloride and/or<br>
sodium phosphate). These can be used for tonicity. A concentration of 10±2mg/ml NaCl is typical<br>
e.g. about 8.8mg/ml. A concentration of 1.2mg/ml sodium phosphate is typical.<br>
Compositions used according to the invention will generally include a buffer e.g. a phosphate buffer.<br>
Compositions used according to the invention may comprise a sugar alcohol (e.g. mannitol) or a<br>
disaccharide (e.g. sucrose or trehalose) e.g. at about 15-30 mg/rnl (e.g. 25 mg/ml), particularly if they<br>
are to be lyophilised or if they include material which has been reconstituted from lyophilised<br>
material. Preferred compositions, however, are not lyophilised i.e. all meningococcal conjugates are<br>
present in aqueous form, from the packaging stage to the administration stage.<br>
Compositions will generally be administered directly to a patient. Direct delivery may be<br>
accomplished by parenteral injection (e.g. subcutaneously, intraperitoneally, intravenously,<br>
intramuscularly, or to the interstitial space of a tissue), or by rectal, oral, vaginal, topical,<br>
transdermal, intranasal, ocular, aural, pulmonary or other mucosal administration. Intramuscular<br>
administration (e.g. to the thigh or the upper arm) is preferred. Injection may be via a needle (e.g. a<br>
hypodermic needle), but needle-free injection may alternatively be used. A typical intramuscular<br>
dose is 0.5 ml.<br>
Meningococcal conjugates from multiple serogroups are administered in admixture within a single<br>
composition. The composition may be administered as a single dose, or may be administered more<br>
than once in a multiple dose schedule. Multiple doses may be used in a primary immunisation<br>
schedule and/or in a booster immunisation schedule. A primary dose schedule may be followed by a<br>
booster dose schedule of the meningococcal conjugates. Suitable timing between priming doses (e.g.<br>
between 4-16 weeks), and between priming and boosting, can be routinely determined. The<br>
conjugates may conveniently be administered at the same time as other vaccines e.g. at the same time<br>
as a D-T-P vaccine, or at the same time as a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, or at the same time as<br>
an influenza vaccine, or at the same time as a MMR or MMRV vaccine. These vaccines will<br>
generally be administered separately but during the same visit to the doctor.<br>
Bacterial infections can affect various areas of the body and so compositions may be prepared in<br>
various forms. For example, the compositions may be prepared as injectables, either as liquid<br>
solutions or suspensions. Solid forms suitable for solution in, or suspension in, liquid vehicles prior<br>
to injection can also be prepared (e.g. a lyophilised composition). The composition may be prepared<br>
for topical administration e.g. as an ointment, cream or powder. The composition be prepared for oral<br>
administration e.g. as a tablet or capsule, or as a syrup (optionally flavoured). The composition may<br>
be prepared for pulmonary administration e.g. as an inhaler, using a fine powder or a spray. The<br>
composition may be prepared as a suppository or pessary. The composition may be prepared for<br>
-11-<br><br>
WO 2006/075170	PCT/GB2006/000120<br>
nasal, aural or ocular administration e.g. as spray, drops, gel or powder [e.g. refs 75 &amp; 76]. In<br>
general, however, the meningococcal conjugates are formulated for intramuscular injection.<br>
Compositions used according to the invention may or may not include a vaccine adjuvant. Adjuvants<br>
which may be used in compositions of the invention include, but are not limited to:<br>
A.	Mineral-containing compositions<br>
Mineral containing compositions suitable for use as adjuvants in the invention include mineral salts,<br>
such as aluminium salts and calcium salts. The invention includes mineral salts such as hydroxides<br>
(e.g. oxyhydroxides), phosphates (e.g. hydroxyphosphates, orthophosphates), sulphates, etc. [e.g. see<br>
chapters 8 &amp; 9 of ref. 77], or mixtures of different mineral compounds, with the compounds taking<br>
any suitable form (e.g. gel, crystalline, amorphous, etc.), and with adsorption being preferred. The<br>
mineral containing compositions may also be formulated as a particle of metal salt [78].<br>
Aluminium phosphates are particularly preferred, and a typical adjuvant is amorphous aluminium<br>
hydroxyphosphate with PO4/A1 molar ratio between 0.84 and 0.92, included at about 0.6mg Al3+/ml.<br>
Adsorption with a low dose of aluminium phosphate may be used e.g. between 50 and 100mg Al3+<br>
per conjugate per dose. Where a composition includes conjugates from multiple bacterial species<br>
then not all conjugates need to be adsorbed.<br>
B.	Oil Emulsions<br>
Oil emulsion compositions suitable for use as adjuvants in the invention include squalene-water<br>
emulsions, such as MF59 [Chapter 10 of ref. 77; see also ref. 79] (5% Squalene, 0.5% Tween 80, and<br>
0.5% Span 85, formulated into submicron particles using a microfluidizer). Complete Freund's<br>
adjuvant (CFA) and incomplete Freund's adjuvant (IFA) may also be used.<br>
C.	Saponin formulations [chapter 22 of ref. 77]<br>
Saponin formulations may also be used as adjuvants in the invention. Saponins are a heterologous<br>
group of sterol glycosides and triterpenoid glycosides that are found in the bark, leaves, stems, roots<br>
and even flowers of a wide range of plant species. Saponin from the bark of the Quillaia saponaria<br>
Molina tree have been widely studied as adjuvants. Saponin can also be commercially obtained from<br>
Smilax ornata (sarsaprilla), Gypsophilla paniculata (brides veil), and Saponaria offlcianalis (soap<br>
root). Saponin adjuvant formulations include purified formulations, such as QS21, as well as lipid<br>
formulations, such as ISCOMs. QS21 is marketed as Stimulon™.<br>
Saponin compositions have been purified using HPLC and RP-HPLC. Specific purified fractions<br>
using these techniques have been identified, including QS7, QS17, QS18, QS21, QH-A, QH-B and<br>
QH-C. Preferably, the saponin is QS21. A method of production of QS21 is disclosed in ref. 80.<br>
Saponin formulations may also comprise a sterol, such as cholesterol [81].<br>
Combinations of saponins and cholesterols can be used to form unique particles called<br>
immunostimulating complexs (ISCOMs) [chapter 23 of ref. 77]. ISCOMs typically also include a<br>
phospholipid such as phosphatidylethanolamine or phosphatidylcholine. Any known saponin can be<br>
-12-<br><br>
WO 2006/075170	PCT/GB2006/000120<br>
used in ISCOMs. Preferably, the ISCOM includes one or more of QuilA, QHA &amp; QHC. ISCOMs are<br>
further described in refs. 81-83. Optionally, the ISCOMS may be devoid of additional detergent [84].<br>
A review of the development of saponin based adjuvants can be found in refs. 85 &amp; 86.<br>
D.	Virosomes and virus-like particles<br>
Virosomes and virus-like particles (VLPs) can also be used as adjuvants in the invention. These<br>
structures generally contain one or more proteins from a virus optionally combined or formulated<br>
with a phospholipid. They are generally non-pathogenic, non-replicating and generally do not contain<br>
any of the native viral genome. The viral proteins may be recombinantly produced or isolated from<br>
whole viruses. These viral proteins suitable for use in virosomes or VLPs include proteins derived<br>
from influenza virus (such as HA or NA), Hepatitis B virus (such as core or capsid proteins),<br>
Hepatitis E virus, measles virus, Sindbis virus, Rotavirus, Foot-and-Mouth Disease virus, Retrovirus,<br>
Norwalk virus, human Papilloma virus, HIV, RNA-phages, Qb-phage (such as coat proteins), GA-<br>
phage, fr-phage, AP205 phage, and Ty (such as retrotransposon Ty protein p1). VLPs are discussed<br>
further in refs. 87-92. Virosomes are discussed further in, for example, ref. 93.<br>
E.	Bacterial or microbial derivatives<br>
Adjuvants suitable for use in the invention include bacterial or microbial derivatives such as<br>
non-toxic derivatives of enterobacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), Lipid A derivatives,<br>
immunostimulatory oligonucleotides and ADP-ribosylating toxins and detoxified derivatives thereof.<br>
Non-toxic derivatives of LPS include monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL) and 3-O-deacylated MPL<br>
(3dMPL). 3dMPL is a mixture of 3 de-O-acylated monophosphoryl lipid A with 4, 5 or 6 acylated<br>
chains. A preferred "small particle" form of 3 De-O-acylated monophosphoryl lipid A is disclosed in<br>
ref. 94. Such "small particles" of 3dMPL are small enough to be sterile filtered through a 0.22mm<br>
membrane [94]. Other non-toxic LPS derivatives include monophosphoryl lipid A mimics, such as<br>
aminoalkyl glucosaminide phosphate derivatives e.g. RC-529 [95,96].<br>
Lipid A derivatives include derivatives of lipid A from Escherichia coli such as OM-174. OM-174 is<br>
described for example in refs. 97 &amp; 98.<br>
Immunostimulatory oligonucleotides suitable for use as adjuvants in the invention include nucleotide<br>
sequences containing a CpG motif (a dinucleotide sequence containing an unmethylated cytosine<br>
linked by a phosphate bond to a guanosine). Double-stranded RNAs and oligonucleotides containing<br>
palindromic or poly(dG) sequences have also been shown to be immunostimulatory.<br>
The CpG's can include nucleotide modifications/analogs such as phosphorothioate modifications and<br>
can be double-stranded or single-stranded. References 99, 100 and 101 disclose possible analog<br>
substitutions e.g. replacement of guanosine with 2'-deoxy-7-deazaguanosine. The adjuvant effect of<br>
CpG oligonucleotides is further discussed in refs. 102-107.<br>
The CpG sequence may be directed to TLR9, such as the motif GTCGTT or TTCGTT [108]. The<br>
CpG sequence may be specific for inducing a Thl immune response, such as a CpG-A ODN, or it<br>
-13-<br><br>
WO 2006/075170	PCT/GB2006/000120<br>
may be more specific for inducing a B cell response, such a CpG-B ODN. CpG-A and CpG-B ODNs<br>
are discussed in refs. 109-111. Preferably, the CpG is a CpG-A ODN.<br>
Preferably, the CpG oligonucleotide is constructed so that the 5' end is accessible for receptor<br>
recognition. Optionally, two CpG oligonucleotide sequences may be attached at their 3' ends to form<br>
"immunomers". See, for example, refs. 108 &amp; 112-114.<br>
Bacterial ADP-ribosylating toxins and detoxified derivatives thereof may be used as adjuvants in the<br>
invention. Preferably, the protein is derived from E.coli (E.coli heat labile enterotoxin "LT"), cholera<br>
("CT"), or pertussis ("PT"). The use of detoxified ADP-ribosylating toxins as mucosal adjuvants is<br>
described in ref. 115 and as parenteral adjuvants in ref. 116. The toxin or toxoid is preferably in the<br>
form of a holotoxin, comprising both A and B subunits. Preferably, the A subunit contains a<br>
detoxifying mutation; preferably the B subunit is not mutated. Preferably, the adjuvant is a detoxified<br>
LT mutant such as LT-K63, LT-R72, and LT-G192. The use of ADP-ribosylating toxins and<br>
detoxified derivaties thereof, particularly LT-K63 and LT-R72, as adjuvants can be found in refs.<br>
117-124. Numerical reference for amino acid substitutions is preferably based on the alignments of<br>
the A and B subunits of ADP-ribosylating toxins set forth in ref 125, specifically incorporated herein<br>
by reference in its entirety.<br>
F.	Human immunomodulators<br>
Human immunomodulators suitable for use as adjuvants in the invention include cytokines, such as<br>
interleukins (e.g. IL-1, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-12 [126], etc.) [127], interferons (e.g.<br>
interferon-g), macrophage colony stimulating factor, and tumor necrosis factor.<br>
G.	Bioadhesives and Mucoadhesives<br>
Bioadhesives and mucoadhesives may also be used as adjuvants in the invention. Suitable<br>
bioadhesives include esterified hyaluronic acid microspheres [128] or mucoadhesives such as<br>
cross-linked derivatives of poly(acrylic acid), polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl pyrollidone,<br>
polysaccharides and carboxymethylcellulose. Chitosan and derivatives thereof may also be used as<br>
adjuvants in the invention [129].<br>
H. Microparticles<br>
Microparticles may also be used as adjuvants in the invention. Microparticles (i.e. a particle of<br>
~100nm to ~150mm in diameter, more preferably ~200nm to ~30mm in diameter, and most preferably<br>
~500nm to ~10mm in diameter) formed from materials that are biodegradable and non-toxic (e.g. a<br>
poly(a-hydroxy acid), a polyhydroxybutyric acid, a polyorthoester, a polyanhydride, a<br>
polycaprolactone, etc.), with poly(lactide-co-glycolide) are preferred, optionally treated to have a<br>
negatively-charged surface (e.g. with SDS) or a positively-charged surface (e.g. with a cationic<br>
detergent, such as CTAB).<br>
I. Liposomes (Chapters 13 &amp; 14 of ref. 77)<br>
Examples of liposome formulations suitable for use as adjuvants are described in refs. 130-132.<br>

J. Polyoxyethylene ether and polyoxyethylene ester formulations<br>
Adjuvants suitable for use in the invention include polyoxyethylene ethers and polyoxyethylene<br>
esters [133]. Such formulations further include polyoxyethylene sorbitan ester surfactants in<br>
combination with an octoxynol [134] as well as polyoxyethylene alkyl ethers or ester surfactants in<br>
combination with at least one additional non-ionic surfactant such as an octoxynol [135]. Preferred<br>
polyoxyethylene ethers are selected from the following group: polyoxyethylene-9-lauryl ether<br>
(laureth 9), polyoxyethylene-9-steoryl ether, polyoxytheylene-8-steoryl ether, polyoxyethylene-4-<br>
lauryl ether, polyoxyethylene-35-lauryl ether, and polyoxyethylene-23-lauryl ether.<br>

(nor-MDP), and N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanyl-D-isoglutaminyl-L-alanine-2-(l '-2'-dipalmitoyl-sn-<br>
glycero-3-hydroxyphosphoryloxy)-ethylamine MTP-PE).<br>
K. Polyphosphazene (PCPP)<br>
PCPP formulations are described, for example, in refs. 136 and 137.<br>
M. Imidazoquinolone Compounds.<br>
Examples of imidazoquinolone compounds suitable for use adjuvants in the invention include<br>
Imiquamod and its homologues (e.g. "Resiquimod 3M"), described further in refs. 138 and 139.<br>
N. Thiosemicarbazone Compounds.<br>
Examples of thiosemicarbazone compounds, as well as methods of formulating, manufacturing, and<br>
screening for compounds all suitable for use as adjuvants in the invention include those described in<br>

peripheral blood mononuclear cells for the production of cytokines, such as TNF-a.<br>
The invention may also comprise combinations of aspects of one or more of the adjuvants identified<br>
above. For example, the following adjuvant compositions may be used in the invention: (1) a saponin<br><br>
WO 2006/075170	PCT/GB2006/000120<br>
system (RAS), (Ribi Immunochem) containing 2% squalene, 0.2% Tween 80, and one or more<br>
bacterial cell wall components from the group consisting of monophosphorylipid A (MPL), trehalose<br>
dimycolate (TDM)., and cell wall skeleton (CWS), preferably MPL + CWS (Detox™); (8) one or<br>
more mineral salts (such as an aluminum salt) + a non-toxic derivative of LPS (such as 3dMPL); and<br>
(9) one or more mineral salts (such as an aluminum salt) + an immunostimulatory oligonucleotide<br>
(such as a nucleotide sequence including a CpG motif).<br>
Other substances that act as immunostimulating agents are disclosed in chapter 7 of ref. 77.<br>
The use of an aluminium hydroxide or aluminium phosphate adjuvant is particularly preferred, and<br>
conjugates are generally adsorbed to these salts [e.g. examples 7 &amp; 8 of ref. 9; example J of ref. 10].<br>
Mixing with aluminium salts with no adsorption is also possible [27, 72]. Calcium phosphate is<br>
another preferred adjuvant. Conjugates may be mixed with (and optionally adsorbed to) the adjuvants<br>
separately and then the conjugates may be mixed together, or the conjugates may be mixed together<br>
and then mixed with adjuvant.<br>
The pH of compositions used according to the invention is preferably between 6 and 8, preferably<br>
about 7. Stable pH may be maintained by the use of a buffer. Where a composition comprises an<br>
aluminium hydroxide salt, it is preferred to use a histidine buffer [146]. The composition may be<br>
sterile and/or pyrogen-free. Compositions may be isotonic with respect to humans.<br>
Compositions may include a preservative (e.g. thiomersal, 2-phenoxyethanol), or may be<br>
preservative-free. Preferred compositions of the invention do not include any mercurial material<br>
e.g. they are thiomersal-free.<br>
To prevent interference between antigens, particularly conjugate antigens, it is possible to include a<br>
polyanionic polymer, such as poly-L-glutamic acid [147].<br>
Compositions may be presented in vials, or they may be presented in ready-filled syringes. The<br>
syringes may be supplied with or without needles. A syringe will include a single dose of the<br>
composition, whereas a vial may include a single dose or multiple doses. Injectable compositions<br>
will usually be liquid solutions or suspensions. Alternatively, they may be presented in solid form<br>
(e.g. freeze-dried) for solution or suspension in liquid vehicles prior to injection.<br>
Compositions may be packaged in unit dose form or in multiple dose form. For multiple dose forms,<br>
vials are preferred to pre-filled syringes. Effective dosage volumes can be routinely established, but a<br>
typical human dose of the composition for injection has a volume of 0.5ml.<br>
Where a composition is to be prepared extemporaneously prior to use (e.g. where a component is<br>
presented in lyophilised form) and is presented as a kit, the kit may comprise two vials, or it may<br>
comprise one ready-filled syringe and one vial, with the contents of the syringe being used to<br>
reactivate the contents of the vial prior to injection. For compositions that include a serogroup A<br>
capsular saccharide then the serogroup A saccharide may be lyophilised, whereas saccharide(s) from<br>
other serogroup(s) may be present in liquid form.<br>
-16-<br><br>
WO 2006/075170	PCT/GB2006/000120<br>
Compositions will comprise an immunologically effective amount of the meningococcal conjugates,<br>
as well as any other components, as needed. By 'immunologically effective amount', it is meant that<br>
the administration of that amount to an individual, either in a single dose or as part of a series, elicits<br>
a protective anti-meningococcal immune response in patients. This amount varies depending upon<br>
the health and physical condition of the individual to be treated, age, the taxonomic group of<br>
individual to be treated (e.g. non-human primate, primate, etc.), the capacity of the individual's<br>
immune system to synthesise antibodies, the degree of protection desired, the formulation of the<br>
vaccine, the treating doctor's assessment of the medical situation, and other relevant factors. It is<br>
expected that the amount will fall in a relatively broad range that can be determined through routine<br>
trials, and a typical quantity of each meningococcal antigen per dose is between lug and 20ug per<br>
serogroup (measured in terms of saccharide) e.g. between 2 and 10 ug per serogroup. A dose of<br>
about 4ug per serogroup is preferred (i.e. a total of16ug in a tetravalent mixture).<br>
The total amount of carrier protein in a composition preferably does not exceed lOOfig/dose e.g. it is<br>
protein in a composition will generally be at least lOug/dose.<br>
General<br>
The term "comprising" encompasses "including" as well as "consisting" e.g. a composition<br>
"comprising" X may consist exclusively of X or may include something additional e.g. X + Y.<br>
The term "about" in relation to a numerical value x means, for example, x+10%.<br>
The word "substantially" does not exclude "completely" e.g. a composition which is "substantially<br>
free" from Y may be completely free from Y. Where necessary, the word "substantially" may be<br>
omitted from the definition of the invention.<br>
MODES FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
Lack of carrier suppression using tetravalent A/C/W135/Y conjugate mixture<br>
Mixtures of meningococcal conjugates for serogroups A+C, C+W+Y or A+C+W+Y can be prepared<br>
as described in references 9 and 10. If desired, these can be mixed with aluminium hydroxide or<br>
aluminium phosphate adjuvants, as also described in references 9 and 10. These vaccines are<br>
prepared using a tetanus toxoid (Tt) carrier protein [147], covalently linked to the saccharides.<br>
Patients who received pediatric D-T-P vaccination (either D-T-Pa or D-T-Pw), including those who<br>
received vaccines containing D-T-P and other antigens (e.g. D-T-P-Hib tetravalent, D-T-P-HBsAg<br>
tetravalent, D-T-P-Hib-HBsAg pentavalent, D-T-P-Hib-HBsAg-IPV hexavalent, etc.) are selected to<br>
receive the mixture of conjugates that has a Tt carrier.<br>
A control group of patients is selected to receive one of the two conjugate mixtures. The control<br>
patients have not previously received tetanus toxoid, either as a separate antigen or as a carrier<br>
protein in a conjugate.<br>
-17-<br><br>
WO 2006/075170	PCT/GB2006/000120<br>
The ability of the tetravalent conjugates to elicit an immune response in the patients is assessed.<br>
Carrier suppression is indicated if the test groups show significantly lower anti-meningococcal<br>
immune responses than the control patients, and in particular if the conjugates fail to elicit a useful<br>
SBA response in the patients.<br>
In clinical trial V59P2, conducted in Finland and Germany with 620 subjects aged 12-16 months,<br>
five formulations were tested. The vaccines used CRM197 carrier and an aluminium phosphate<br>
adjuvant [10]. Doses of each serogroup saccharide, expressed as mg saccharide mass per 0.5ml dose,<br>
were as follows:<br><br>
Group	MenA	MenC	MenW135	MenY<br>
1	10	10	10	10<br>
2	0	10	10	10<br>
3	10	5	5	5<br>
4	5	5	5	5<br>
5	2.5	2.5	2.5	2.5<br>
Subjects received an injection at time zero, and 25% of the subjects then received a second dose of<br>
the vaccine 4 weeks later.<br>
Sera of patients were collected 1 month after vaccine administration and were tested in a SBA assay<br>
against N.meningitidis from each serogroup, using human complement. SBA titre increase relative to<br>
time zero sera was assessed, with criteria being ≥1:4 and ≥1:8. Anti-capsule titres (GMT) were also<br>
measured for each serogroup. Results are shown in Table 1 below.<br>
Thus the trivalent and tetravalent vaccines were both immunogenic in toddlers. The conjugates are<br>
immunogenic at saccharide doses as low as 2.5mg per conjugate. The immune response are<br>
boostable, with large SBA titre increases after the second dose. No evidence of carrier suppression<br>
was seen in this trial.<br>
It will be understood that the invention is described above by way of example only and modifications<br>
may be made while remaining within the scope and spirit of the invention.<br>

aluminium hydroxide adjuvant and/or an aluminium phosphate adjuvant.<br>
18.	The method or use of any preceding claim, wherein the disease caused by Neisseria meningitidis<br>
is meningococcal meningitis.<br>

Conjugated meningococcal capsular saccharides will be introduced into immunisation schedules in the near future,<br>
but the phenomenon of "carrier suppression" must first be addressed, particularly where multiple conjugates are to be used. In the<br>
invention, tetanus toxoid is used as the carrier protein, even where multiple meningococcal conjugates are administered at the same<br>
time and where a patient has previously been exposed to the carrier protein, either in the form of a previous immunogen (e.g. in a<br>
DTP vaccine)or as a previous carrier protein (e.g. in a Hib or pneumococcal conjugate vaccine). The invention provides a method for<br>
immunising a patient, comprising administering multiple conjugates of meningococcal capsular saccharides, wherein each conjugate<br>
comprises a tetanus toxoid carrier protein, and the capsular saccharide, and wherein the patient has been pre-immunised with a tetanus<br>
toxoid.</td>
