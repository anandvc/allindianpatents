PROCESS FOR SEPARATING NITROGEN GAS<br>
AND MOLECULAR SIEVE CARBON<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a process for<br>
separating nitrogen gas and to a molecular sieve carbon<br>
for use in such a process. More specifically, the present<br>
invention relates to a process for separating nitrogen and<br>
to a molecular sieve carbon for use in such a process,<br>
wherein a feed gas made up mainly of nitrogen is fed under<br>
pressure to one of at least two adsorption columns packed<br>
with molecular sieve carbon to conduct high pressure<br>
adsorption, the one of at least two adsorption columns<br>
having completed high pressure adsorption is subjected to<br>
low pressure desorption, and the alternating cycle of the<br>
high pressure adsorption and the low pressure desorption<br>
are repeated in each adsorption column to separate<br>
nitrogen gas product, wherein<br>
the molecular sieve carbon has 0.7wt% or less<br>
ignition residue and the following relationships (I) and<br>
(II) are satisfied:<br>
(1)	InC 
(2)	InU 
 <br>
where C indicates an oxygen level (ppm) in the nitrogen<br>
gas product; Q indicates a volume of nitrogen gas produced<br>
per minute per unit effective volume of a single<br>
adsorption column; P indicates an adsorption pressure<br>
(MPa); and U indicates a ratio of the volume of the feed<br>
air to the volume of the nitrogen gas produced.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
[0002]<br>
Nitrogen gas has been increasingly used in many<br>
fields, including treatment of metals, production of<br>
semiconductors and a sealing gas in chemical industry.<br>
Pressure swing adsorption (referred to as "PSA",<br>
hereinafter) is one of the most commonly used techniques<br>
in the production of nitrogen gas. In many cases, the<br>
technique is used to separate nitrogen from pressurized<br>
air and involves the use of porous carbon materials such<br>
as molecular sieve carbon. When the feed gas is air, two<br>
or more adsorption columns packed with molecular sieve<br>
carbon are generally used. The air is fed under pressure<br>
to one of the columns to cause oxygen to be adsorbed onto<br>
the molecular sieve, letting the unadsorbed nitrogen flow<br>
out of the column for collection. Meanwhile, the pressure<br>
in the other column is reduced to cause the adsorbed<br>
oxygen to be desorbed. The adsorption and desorption of<br><br>
oxygen are alternated in the multiple columns. In this<br>
manner, nitrogen can be continuously collected by taking<br>
advantage of the difference in the adsorption rate between<br>
oxygen and nitrogen.<br>
[0003]<br>
Referring to Fig. 1, a conventional PSA process is<br>
described wherein this process uses two adsorption columns<br>
to remove oxygen from air or other gas mixtures composed<br>
mainly of nitrogen, thus giving nitrogen as a gas product<br>
and regeneration of an adsorbent under normal pressure.<br>
In an adsorption step in a adsorption column 4, a feed gas,<br>
such as air, is introduced via a feed gas inlet line 1<br>
into a compressor 2 where it is compressed; and the<br>
compressed air is passed through a cooler 3 into the<br>
adsorption column 4. Each adsorption column is packed<br>
with molecular sieve carbon to serve as the adsorbent. In<br>
the adsorption column, oxygen in the feed gas is<br>
preferentially adsorbed onto the adsorbent and removed<br>
from the feed gas, allowing the remaining nitrogen to flow<br>
through to a product reservoir 6, from which the nitrogen<br>
is collected via a gas product line 16.<br>
[0004]<br>
When one of the adsorption columns is operated in<br>
the adsorption step, the other is operated in the<br>
desorption step and is open to the atmosphere.<br><br>
Specifically, valves 7, 10 and 12 are opened and valves 8,<br>
9, 11, 13 and 14 are closed when the adsorption column 4<br>
is operated in the adsorption step. Part of the gas that<br>
flows out of the adsorption column 4 flows through an<br>
orifice 15 into the other column operating in the<br>
desorption step and purges the column.<br>
[0005]<br>
After a predetermined period of time, the valves 7,<br>
10 and 12 are closed. In the next pressure equalization<br>
step, the valves 11 and 14 are opened to release the<br>
residual pressure inside the adsorption column 4 into the<br>
adsorption column 5. Subsequently, the valves 8, 9 and 13<br>
are opened and the valves 7, 10, 11, 12 and 14 are closed,<br>
so that the adsorption column 5 switches to adsorption<br>
step and the adsorption column 4 switches to desorption<br>
step. Once the adsorption in the adsorption column 5<br>
comes to an end, the valves 8, 9 and 13 are closed and the<br>
valves 11 and 14 are opened to release the residual<br>
pressure inside the adsorption column 5 into the<br>
adsorption column 4, thereby equalizing the pressure in<br>
the system. This sequence operations are repeated<br>
cyclically to produce nitrogen product.<br>
[0006]<br>
These valves are automatically opened or closed at<br>
the timings set by a timer, so that the nitrogen product<br><br>
is stored in the product reservoir 6 from which it is<br>
drawn out through the product gas outlet line 15 and is<br>
consumed. The gas (oxygen) adsorbed onto the molecular<br>
sieve carbon is desorbed as the pressure in the columns is<br>
reduced: once the valve 9 or 10 is opened, the adsorbed<br>
gas is released from the molecular sieve carbon and is<br>
discharged from the discharge line 17.<br>
[0007]<br>
There are two ways to make PSA an industrially more<br>
advantageous process: to improve the separation<br>
performance of molecular sieve carbon or to improve the<br>
efficiency of PSA system. Of many PSA processes that have<br>
been proposed thus far, few have taken into account both<br>
of these two approaches. In one process for making<br>
improved molecular sieve carbon, a hydrocarbon such as<br>
toluene is added to coke and the coke is processed at a<br>
high temperature. This causes carbon to be deposited<br>
within the pores of coke and as a result, the size of the<br>
pores is optimized. This improved molecular sieve is used<br>
to remove oxygen from the air to produce nitrogen gas<br>
(Patent Document 1).<br>

[0008]<br>
In another process, coconut shell carbon powder is<br><br>
granulated using a coal tar pitch binder and is carbonized.<br>
The granules are washed with hydrochloric acid, and<br>
impregnated with coal tar pitch. The carbonized carbon is<br>
then heated to make a molecular sieve carbon. This<br>
molecular sieve carbon is used to produce nitrogen gas<br>
from the air (Patent Document 2).<br>
Patent Document 2: Japanese Examined Patent Publication No.<br>
Sho 61-8004<br>
[0009]<br>
In still another process, coconut shell carbon<br>
powder is similarly formed into granules using a coal tar<br>
pitch binder. The granules are washed with hydrochloric<br>
acid, and impregnated with creosote oil. The carbonized<br>
carbon is then heated to make a molecular sieve carbon.<br>
This molecular sieve carbon is used to produce nitrogen<br>
gas from the air (Patent Document 3).<br>

Hei 5-66886<br>
[0010]<br>
On the other hand, some PSA processes focus on<br>
improving the efficiency of the process by modifying the<br>
design of the system. One such system uses a molecular<br>
sieve carbon with specifically defined performance and is<br>
designed such that the time at which the exhaustion valve<br>
is opened during the regeneration step under atmospheric<br><br>
pressure and the time at which the nitrogen gas product is<br>
passed through the adsorption columns are controlled to<br>
satisfy a predetermined relationship. The performance of<br>
the molecular sieve carbon is defined by determining the<br>
ability of the molecular sieve to adsorb oxygen or<br>
nitrogen. Specifically, this is done by leaving the<br>
molecular sieve in the presence of each gas alone under<br>
pressure for 1 minute and determining the ratio of the<br>
volumes of oxygen and nitrogen adsorbed by the molecular<br>
sieve (Patent Document No. 4).<br>
Patent Document 4: Japanese Patent No. 2619839<br>
[0011]<br>
Another such system uses a molecular sieve carbon<br>
with its performance defined by determining its ability to<br>
adsorb oxygen or nitrogen. Likewise, the performance is<br>
determined by leaving the molecular sieve in the presence<br>
of oxygen or nitrogen alone under pressure for 1 minute<br>
and determining the ratio of the volumes of oxygen and<br>
nitrogen adsorbed by the molecular sieve. In this system,<br>
the product nitrogen gas amount taken out and the<br>
effective volume of the product storage tank are<br>
controlled so as to be correlated to the effective volume<br>
per one adsorbing tower, and the time required for the<br>
adsorption step is specified(Patent Document 5).<br>
Patent Document 5: Japanese Patent No. 2623487<br><br>
[0012]<br>
These improved PSA systems may be used in<br>
conjunction with any of the modified molecular sieve<br>
carbons to make the PSA process even more suitable for<br>
industrial applications. To this end, it is necessary to<br>
design small PSA systems that require minimum amounts of<br>
molecular sieve carbon and feed air.<br>
[0013]<br>
Recently, a PSA system in which the pressure rise<br>
rate at the pressurizing step and the time at the<br>
pressure-equalizing step are controlled is developed.<br>
This facilitates effective generation of highly pure<br>
nitrogen gas (Patent Document 6). Another PSA system<br>
achieves improved separation performance by using a<br>
cylindrical molecular sieve carbon that is 0.5 to 1.5 mm<br>
in height (Patent Document No. 7).<br>

DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0014]<br>
The PSA systems described in Patent Documents 6 and<br>
7 each enable effective separation of nitrogen gas and are<br><br>
each a relatively advanced system. However, the PSA<br>
system of Patent Document 6 has a drawback in that it<br>
still requires a substantial volume of molecular sieve<br>
carbon, though the volume of air used has been<br>
sufficiently reduced. The PSA system of Patent Document 7<br>
on the other hand has a problem that, despite the large<br>
volume of nitrogen produced by each molecular sieve carbon,<br>
the air consumption by the system is significantly large,<br>
making the system industrially unattractive.<br>
[0015]<br>
Thus, no PSA systems have ever been developed that<br>
meet the two essential requirements for an industrially<br>
viable PSA process: small volume of molecular sieve carbon<br>
and small volume of feed air. It is therefore an object<br>
of the present invention to provide an industrially viable<br>
PSA process that requires small volumes of molecular sieve<br>
carbon and feed air.<br>
MEANS TO SOLVE THE PROBLEMS<br>
[0016]<br>
To achieve the above-mentioned objective, the<br>
present inventor have closely examined previously reported<br>
PSA processes and have discovered that for the development<br>
of industrially viable PSA processes, it is necessary to<br>
use a molecular sieve carbon that has 0.7 wt% or less<br><br>
ignition residue. The present inventor have also<br>
discovered that the oxygen level in the nitrogen gas<br>
product, the volume of the nitrogen gas produced per<br>
minute per unit effective volume of a single adsorption<br>
column, and the adsorption pressure are closely related to<br>
one another, as are the ratio of the volume of the feed<br>
air to the volume of the nitrogen gas product and the<br>
oxygen level in the nitrogen gas product: These quantities<br>
must satisfy a particular relationship. These findings<br>
ultimately led to the present invention.<br>
[0017]<br>
Accordingly, the present invention in one aspect<br>
provides a process for separating nitrogen, wherein a feed<br>
gas made up mainly of nitrogen is fed under pressure to<br>
one of at least two adsorption columns packed with<br>
molecular sieve carbon to conduct high pressure adsorption,<br>
the one of at least two adsorption columns having<br>
completed high pressure adsorption is subjected to low<br>
pressure desorption, and the alternating cycle of the high<br>
pressure adsorption and the low pressure desorption are<br>
repeated in each adsorption column to separate nitrogen<br>
gas product, wherein<br>
the molecular sieve carbon has 0.7wt% or less<br>
ignition residue and the following relationships (I) and<br>
(II) are satisfied:<br><br>
(1)	InC 
(2)	InU 
where C indicates an oxygen level (ppm) in the nitrogen<br>
gas product; Q indicates a volume of nitrogen gas produced<br>
per minute per unit effective volume of a single<br>
adsorption column; P indicates an adsorption pressure<br>
(MPa); and U indicates a ratio of the volume of the feed<br>
air to the volume of the nitrogen gas produced.<br>
[0018]<br>
In another aspect, the present invention provides a<br>
molecular sieve carbon with a ignition residue of 0.7% or<br>
less, wherein; when a feed gas made up mainly of nitrogen<br>
is fed under pressure to one of at least two adsorption<br>
columns packed with the molecular sieve carbon to conduct<br>
high pressure adsorption, the one of at least two<br>
adsorption columns having completed high pressure<br>
adsorption is subjected to low pressure desorption, and<br>
the alternating cycle of the high pressure adsorption and<br>
the low pressure desorption are repeated in each<br>
adsorption column to separate nitrogen gas; the molecular<br>
sieve carbon satisfies the following relationships (I')<br>
and (II'):<br>
(1)	InC 
(2)	InU 
where C indicates an oxygen level (ppm) in the nitrogen<br><br>
gas product; Q indicates a volume of nitrogen gas produced<br>
per minute per unit effective volume of a single<br>
adsorption column; P indicates an adsorption pressure<br>
(MPa); and U indicates a ratio of the volume of the feed<br>
air to the volume of the nitrogen gas produced.<br>
ADVANTAGES OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0019]<br>
According to the present invention, there is<br>
provided an industrially viable PSA process that requires<br>
small volumes of molecular sieve carbon and feed air. The<br>
PSA process of the present invention can produce highly<br>
pure nitrogen with decreased volumes of molecular sieve<br>
carbon and feed air and thus serves as a cost effective<br>
PSA technique.<br>
BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
[0020]<br>
The most significant feature of the process of the<br>
present invention for separating nitrogen gas is the use<br>
of the molecular sieve carbon that has 0.7 wt% or less<br>
ignition residue and satisfies the following relationships<br>
(I) and (II):<br>
(1)	InC 
(2)	InU 
 <br>
where C indicates the oxygen level (ppm) in the nitrogen<br>
gas product; Q indicates the volume of nitrogen gas<br>
produced per minute per unit effective volume of a single<br>
adsorption column; P indicates the adsorption pressure<br>
(MPa); and U indicates the ratio of the volume of the feed<br>
air to the volume of the nitrogen gas produced.<br>
[0021]<br>
It is more preferred that InC satisfies the<br>
following relationship (III):<br>
InC 
[0022]<br>
The molecular sieve carbon used to pack the<br>
adsorption columns in the process for separating nitrogen<br>
gas of the present invention has superfine pores sized 3<br>
to 5 angstroms. Such molecular sieve carbons are produced<br>
by charring charcoal, coal, coke, coconut shell, resin,<br>
pitch or other materials having uniformly sized fine pores<br>
to make plant-based, coal-based, resin-based or pitch-<br>
based carbon material, decalcifying the carbon material,<br>
and adjusting the pore size of the decalcified carbon<br>
material. Plant-based carbon materials are particularly<br>
preferred for ease of decalcification. Of different<br>
plant-based carbon materials, coconut shell is<br>
particularly preferred.<br>
[0023]<br><br>
Plant-based carbon materials such as coconut shell<br>
generally contain 2.0wt% or more ash. In order to use<br>
coconut shell or other plant-based carbon materials in the<br>
present invention, their ash content must be reduced to<br>
0.7 wt% or less. Though the ash content of these<br>
materials may be reduced by any suitable technique, it is<br>
preferred to repeatedly wash them with hydrochloric acid.<br>
The term "0.7 wt% or less ash" as used herein means the<br>
amount of ash remaining in the molecular sieve carbon<br>
after pore size adjustment of the carbon materials that<br>
are materials of active carbon. Once the ash content has<br>
been reduced to 0.7wt% or less, the pore size is adjusted<br>
to obtain molecular sieve carbon suitable for use in the<br>
present invention.<br>
[0024]<br>
The adsorption time is typically set to the range of<br>
2 0 sec to 12 0 sec, and more preferably over the range of<br>
40 sec to 70 sec. Although the shape of the molecular<br>
sieve carbon may not be restricted, spheres or cylinders<br>
(pellets) that are 0.4 to 1.5 mm in outer diameter (D) are<br>
practically preferred. When the molecular sieve carbon is<br>
formed as cylinder, it is typically formed such that the<br>
ratio of the length of the cylinder (L) to the outer<br>
diameter (D) thereof is from about 2 to about 5.<br>
[0025]<br><br>
The molecular sieve carbon for use in the process of<br>
the present invention may be prepared in the following<br>
manner: Coconut shell carbon powder is granulated using a<br>
coal tar pitch binder and is carbonized. The granules are<br>
carbonized at 600°C to 900°C and washed repeatedly with a<br>
mineral acid such as hydrochloric acid. The granules are<br>
then washed with water, dried, and impregnated with a pore<br>
treatment such as creosote oil. The impregnated granules<br>
are then heated at 600°C to 900°C and are cooled in an<br>
inert gas to make the desired molecular sieve carbon. In<br>
this fashion, the ash content of the molecular sieve<br>
carbon can be reduced to 0.7 wt% or less and the pore size<br>
can be adjusted as desired.<br>
[0026]<br>
The molecular sieve carbon so obtained can be used<br>
in the PSA process to produce nitrogen from the air in an<br>
industrially favorable manner. Though the underlying<br>
mechanism is not fully understood, it is believed that<br>
decalcifying the carbon material to reduce the ignition<br>
residue to 0.7 wt% or less increases the pore volume, thus<br>
increasing the volume of oxygen adsorption. The<br>
decalcification also decreases the impurity during the<br>
pore adjustment and thereby facilitates the formation of<br>
pores suitable for the separation of nitrogen from the air.<br>
The present invention will now be described in further<br><br>
detail with reference to Examples, which are not intended<br>
to limit the scope of the invention in any way.<br>
[0027]<br>
Production of molecular sieve carbon A:<br>
4 0 parts by weight of coal tar and 8 parts by weight<br>
of water were added to 100 parts by weight of fine crushed<br>
coconut shell carbon and the mixture was thoroughly mixed<br>
and kneaded. The mixture was pressed in a hydraulic press<br>
and was extruded from a 0.8 mm nozzle to form cylindrical<br>
granules. The resulting cylindrical granules were heated<br>
at 600°C for 30 min in a fluid-type pyrolysis furnace and<br>
were then cooled in nitrogen.<br>
[0028]<br>
The granules were thoroughly immersed in 0.6N<br>
hydrochloric acid at 80°C while the solution was stirred.<br>
Hydrochloric acid was then discarded. After washed three<br>
times with hydrochloric acid, the granules were washed<br>
with water and dried to make purified carbon, which in<br>
turn was heated at 90 0°C in an external electric furnace<br>
and was cooled in nitrogen. 3 parts by weight of a 14 0 to<br>
260°C fraction of creosote oil were then added to the<br>
purified carbon. This mixture was placed in a rotary kiln<br>
in a weak stream of nitrogen gas and the temperature was<br>
increased from room temperature to 400°C in 20 minutes to<br>
thoroughly impregnate with creosote oil. Subsequently,<br><br>
the temperature was further increased to 700°C in 20<br>
minutes for heat treatment. The granules were then<br>
allowed to cool to room temperature in nitrogen to give<br>
molecular sieve carbon.<br>
[0029]<br>
Production of molecular sieve carbon B:<br>
A molecular sieve carbon was obtained in the same<br>
manner as molecular sieve carbon A, except that the<br>
granules were not washed with hydrochloric acid.<br>
[0030]<br>
Production of molecular sieve carbon C:<br>
A molecular sieve carbon was obtained in the same<br>
manner as molecular sieve carbon A, except that the<br>
granules were washed once with hydrochloric acid at room<br>
temperature.<br>
[0031]<br>
Production of molecular sieve carbon D:<br>
A molecular sieve carbon was obtained in the same<br>
manner as molecular sieve carbon A, except that a 1.6 mm<br>
nozzle was used.<br>
[0032]<br>
Production of molecular sieve carbon E:<br>
A molecular sieve carbon was obtained in the same<br>
manner as molecular sieve carbon A, except that a 0.4 mm<br>
nozzle was used.<br><br>
[0033]<br>
Production of molecular sieve carbon F:<br>
4 0 parts by weight of coal tar and 8 parts by weight<br>
of water were added to 100 parts by weight of fine crushed<br>
coconut shell carbon and the mixture was thoroughly mixed<br>
and kneaded. The mixture was pressed in a hydraulic press<br>
and was extruded from a 0.6 mm nozzle to formpellets.<br>
With a high-speed mixer FS-G (Fukae Powtec) operated at<br>
60°C, 400 rpm, the resulting cylindrical carbon granules<br>
were formed into spheres with an average particle size of<br>
1.0 mm. The spheric carbon granules were heated at 600°C<br>
for 30 min in a fluid-type pyrolysis furnace and were<br>
cooled in nitrogen. The rest of the procedure was<br>
performed as described in the production of molecular<br>
sieve carbon A to give molecular sieve carbon F. The<br>
molecular sieve carbons A through F were analyzed for the<br>
ash content as a measure of the ignition residue and the<br>
equilibrium oxygen adsorption. The results are shown in<br>
Table 1. In Table 1, "mL" denotes milliliter. The results<br>
indicate that a molecular sieve carbon with a smaller<br>
ignition residue tends to have a greater equilibrium<br>
oxygen adsorption.<br><br><br>

Examples 1 through 10 and Comparative Examples 1 through 4<br>
Using the system shown in Fig. 1, a PSA process was<br>
carried out for each of molecular sieve carbons A through<br>
F with each adsorption column packed with 3.0L of a<br>
corresponding molecular sieve carbon. Each process was<br>
carried out using a corresponding pressure shown in Table<br>
2. The results are shown in Table 2. In Table 2, "NL"<br>
denotes normal litter and indicates the volume of nitrogen<br>
gas under standard conditions<br><br><br><br>
INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY<br>
[0037]<br>
According to the present invention, there is<br>
provided an industrially viable PSA process that requires<br>
small volumes of molecular sieve carbon and feed air. The<br>
PSA process of the present invention can produce highly-<br>
pure nitrogen with decreased volumes of molecular sieve<br>
carbon and feed air. The process serves as a cost<br>
effective PSA technique and is thus of industrial<br>
importance.<br>
