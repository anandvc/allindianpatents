				<td>PRODUCTION OF WHOLE GRAIN SHREDDED PRODUCTS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001]	The present invention relates to a process for the production of shredded products, such as snacks and ready-to-eat cereals from whole cereal grains.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]	Whole cereal grains are nutritious and provide a high dietary fiber content. Shredded products have been historically made with whole grain wheat. Generally, in the production of shredded wheat ready-to-eat cereal biscuits and shredded wheat wafers from whole grains, a plurality of shredded layers are laminated upon one other, and the laminate is cut, dockered, and baked to provide products having a distinctly visible shred pattern on their opposing major surfaces. The shreds provide visual attractiveness and a unique, crispy texture and connote a healthy, hearty, natural product. Also, the shreds provide increased surface area and deliver a robust flavor.<br>
[0003]	To prepare wheat for shredding, whole wheat berries are generally cooked and then tempered, using prolonged tempering times. Wheat is generally easy to shred over long periods after the cooking and tempering, for example up to about 24 hours after tempering. Whole wheat is unique in that it contains gluten which helps to retain water and to provide cohesiveness and elasticity during machining even KFHI-120 (42905)<br><br>
after prolonged periods after tempering. However, the same is not true for other grains because of their lack of gluten and their unique chemical composition and changes that happen to the grains after cooking and tempering.<br>
[0004]	Starch-based compositions which have little or no gluten, when mixed with water, do not form a dough that is cohesive at room temperature and continuously machinable or sheetable. Machinability of dough made from ingredients having little or no gluten may be improved by forming a dough under elevated temperature conditions, such as by steaming the ingredients, as disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,873,093 and 4,834,996 to Fazzolareet al. However, in the production of shredded products from cooked, tempered, non-glutenous whole grains such as corn, oats, rye, and barley, shreddability into long continuous shreds tends to decrease as tempering times increase or as the time between tempering and shredding increases. For example, cooked corn has a tendency to become hard and rubbery during the cooling and tempering process due, it is believed, to starch retrogradation. Also, storing of tempered corn in surge bins to accommodate mass production processes tends to increase starch retrogradation and hardness. The cooked, tempered cereal grains which become hardened or rubbery, tend to fracture during shredding or do not conform to shredding roll grooves for producing continuous, well-defined shredded net-like sheets.<br>
[0005]	In conventional processes for producing shredded cereals, the grain is cooked and then permitted to temper to increase shred strength. Tempering of the cooked grains prior to shredding has generally been considered necessary for obtaining strong, KFHI-120 (42905)<br><br>
continuous shreds. In U.S. PatentNos. 548,086 and 1,159,045, cooked wheat or similar grains are subjected to tempering times of over 12 hours before shredding. As described in U.S. Patent No. 4,179,527, in the manufacture of a whole wheat food product such as shredded wheat, whole wheat is cooked sufficiently to gelatinize the starch. Gelatinization is a function of water penetration into the whole berry, temperature, and time, for a given type of grain. According to U.S. Patent No. 4,179,527, the gelatinization of wheat starch involves a destruction of bonds in the crystalline regions of starch granules. Retrogradation is the return of the starch molecules to a crystalline structure, which is different from the original crystalline structures, upon cooling. Tempering permits the gelatinized wheat starch to slowly cool and permits water migration through the wheat particles to achieve a uniform water distribution within the particles. Retrogradation occurs during tempering. According to U.S. Patent No. 4,179,527, if shredding is attempted shortly after cooking, the insufficient degree of retrogradation or tempering results in at best, short noncontinuous strands and/or strands which are tough, curly, or suffer from other physical ortextural disadvantage. In U.S. Patent No. 4,179,527, the time required for the tempering of cooked whole wheat is substantially reduced by chilling the wheat at a temperature of from 1 °C. to about 12 °C. [0006]	It is believed that for wheat, the tempering permits distribution of water and facilitates development of the gluten into a network which provides cohesiveness for shredding. It is also believed that the retrogradation of wheat starch during tempering or after tempering is slow so as not to impede shredding or it forms a crystalline structure KFHI-120 (42905)<br><br>
which permits shredding in the presence of gluten. Tempering of non-glutenous grains, such as corn, oats, rye, and barley also helps to distribute water throughout the starch granules. It is believed that release of some soluble starch during cooking and distribution of the starch and water during tempering helps to provide cohesiveness. However, the amount released may be insufficient for continuous shreddability or starch retrogradation may be too rapid and may provide a crystalline structure which impedes shreddability into long continuous shreds.<br>
[0007]	Numerous other processes for producing shredded cereal products with reduced tempering times or without any apparent tempering are also known. Shredded cereal products, whether tempering is used or not, have also been produced by shredding the cereal in a form other than its cooked berry form.<br>
[0008]	International Patent PublicationNos. WO 03/034838 Al and WO 03/024242 Al, andU.S, Patent Application Publication No. US 2004/0166201 Al disclose the addition of an enzyme to starch-based raw materials to accelerate the retrogradation of starch and thus allow a shortening of the tempering step in the production of snack pellets and in the production of shredded cereals.<br>
[0009]	U.S. Patent No. 6,303,177 and European Patent Application Publication No. EP 1,132,010 Al disclose the production of a soy containing breakfast cereal by extrusion cooking a composition containing a soy material and a cereal grain to obtain a substantially gelatinized dough. A conventional pelletizer may be used to form dough KFHI-120 (42905)<br><br>
beads from the cooked dough as it is extruded from the forming extruder. The pelletizer blades cut the dough extrudate rope into beads or pellets for further processing into flakes or shredded cereal. The dough beads may be dried to a moisture content of less than 18% and then the dried beads may be tempered for about 4 hours to about 10 hours before shredding.<br>
[0010]	U.S. Patent No. 5,368,870 discloses fortifying a ready-to-eat cereal with beta carotene by adding to cooked tempered cereal grains prior to piece forming. Tempering times may range from approximately 2 hours to approximately 36 hours. The cooked cereals pieces may comprise cooked grains or fragments such as whole wheat berries or grits, corn cones, oat flakes, and the like. After fortification, the cooked tempered cereal pieces may be formed into pellets for flaking or may be shred in shredding rolls.<br>
[0011]	U.S. Patent No. 5,182,127 and International Patent Publication No. WO 93/05665 disclose tempering of cooked cereal pellets or pieces for ready-to-eat cereals or cereal based snack half products by exposing the pellets or pieces to a high intensity microwave field for a brief time sufficient to improve moisture distribution therein but without causing the pellets or pieces to puff. The microwave tempered pellets or pieces may be flaked or shredded.<br>
[0012]	U.S. Patent No. 4,528,202 discloses the production of the ready-to-eat shredded potato products by combining at least one potato starch source with water under KFHI-120 (42905)<br><br>
low temperature and low shear mixing conditions so as to avoid overgelatinization of the potato starch and to form individual discrete dough pieces or particles, tempering the dough pieces for at least about two hours to distribute the water substantially uniformly throughout the dough pieces, shredding the tempered dough pieces, and cooking the shredded dough.<br>
[0013]	Processes where tempering is not specifically mentioned or is indicated as being optional in the production of cereals from wheat or other grains, are disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 1,189,130, 2,008,024,1,946,803, 502,378, 897,181, 3,062,657, 3,462,277, 3,732,109 and Canadian Patent No. 674,046.<br>
[0014]	In U.S. Patent No. 1,189,130, thoroughly moistened bran, such as wheat bran, is mixed with up to 50% of whole wheat or other gelatinous cereal flour or starch-bearing material, and is cooked in pans in a steam retort. The cooked product is dried to a lumpy condition, the lumps are pressed through a vial mesh and the resulting rice sized lumps are then fed through shredding mills.<br>
[0015]	In U.S. Patent No. 2,008,024, a cereal biscuit is prepared by steaming or boiling wheat alone or with other forms of cereal or food material, surface drying the cooked product, and then converting it into a thin ribbed sheet. The shredding rolls are spaced sufficiently apart so that a sheeted material with ribs is obtained instead of a shredded product. [0016]	In U.S. Patent No. 1,946,803, rice, alone or in combination with bran, is KFHI-120 (42905)<br><br>
steam cooked, dried and cooled to a rubbery consistency, ground and optionally tempered to effect a uniform water distribution. This product is then passed between grooved rollers to form long flat ribbons. These ribbons are dried to produce a brittle product which is broken and then puffed by toasting.<br>
[0017]	In U.S. Patent No. 502,378, a cereal grain is prepared for shredding by boiling, steaming, steeping or soaking. Depending upon the spacing between the rollers, a product in the form of threads, lace, ribbons, or sheets, and the like, is obtained.<br>
[0018]	In U.S. Patent No. 897,181, cereal grain or vegetable in whole form is wetted but not cooked and then passed repeatedly between grooved rollers and then baked. Boiling or steaming of the grain or vegetable, it is disclosed, produces considerable change in its chemical quality and a number of the nutritious soluble elements escapes to the water.<br>
[0019]	In the processes of U.S. Patent Nos. 3,062,657, 3,462,277, and 3,732,109, and Canadian Patent No. 674,046, a shredded product is not produced by means of shredding rolls. In U.S. PatentNo. 3,062,657, flour and water are mixed to form a dough in an extruder. The dough is cooked in the extruder and then tempered in the extruder at a lower temperature. The extrudates are cut into pellets to simulate cooked and dried grains such as corn grits, whole wheat berries, oat groats, rice and the like. The extrudates, it is disclosed, have a moisture content ideal for flaking. It is generally on the order of 18 to 24% by weight, the moisture being uniformly distributed throughout so that the necessity KFHI-120 (42905)<br><br>
for tempering is entirely eliminated and the extrudate can be immediately transferred to a flaking operation. It is disclosed that it is preferable to further cool the extrudate before it enters the flaking device to optimize flaking properties.<br>
[0020]	In U.S. Patent No. 3,462,277, a mixture of cereal flour or grits and water is passed through an extruder to gelatinize the starch while the dough is cooked and transformed into a rubber-like mass. The moisture content of the mixture is 13 to 35%. The continuous U-shaped extrudate is pinched off into segments by cutting rolls to form canoe-shaped cereal products. The separated canoe-shaped pieces are then dried to below 15% moisture.<br>
[0021]	U.S. Patent No. 3,732,109, discloses the production of a ready-to-eat oat cereal biscuit by subjecting an oat flour-water mixture to a water boiling temperature and superatmospheric pressure to gelatinize a portion of the starch in the oat flour. The mixture then passes through an orifice and the extruded product is cut into small pieces. The flake-shaped pieces which are formed are dried to a moisture content of from about 2% to about 6% by weight water. The dried flakes are then subdivided, admixed with a syrup, and compacted into the form of a biscuit. The formed biscuits are then dried to a moisture content of from about 4 to 5% by weight.<br>
[0022]	In Canadian Patent No. 674,046, a shredded dry oat cereal product is produced without the use of shredding rolls. A dough is cooked in a screw extruder, extruded through orifices to form a strand bundle, and the strand bundle is cut into pieces KFHI-120 (42905)<br><br>
by a cutting device which may be a pair of rolls.<br>
[0023]	Processes for the production of shredded cereals from cereal grains wherein considerable tempering is used, as in the conventional process for the production of shredded wheat, are disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 1,159,045,1,170,162, 1,197,297, and 4,004,035. In U.S. Patent Nos. 1,159,045, 1,170,162 and 1,197,297, the whole berry is pulverized so as to permit flavoring ingredients to be incorporated in the final product. A dough is formed from flour, flavoring, and water. The dough is then cooked, rolled into slabs and then atmospherically dried for a period of 24 to 40 hours. The dried product is toasted, broken into pea size pieces, dried and then shredded. In U.S. Patent No. 4,004,035, shredded biscuits are formed by depositing a layer of shredded cereal in zig-zag configuration on a moving belt to facilitate severing the material. In addition to whole wheat, other foods capable of being shredded, such as other cooked cereal, wheat germ, defatted soy, other vegetable protein, fruits, vegetable slurries and mixtures thereof may be employed in producing the biscuits. The food is softened by cooking and tempering prior to shredding.<br>
[0024]	In the production of shredded cereals by means of shredding rolls, obtaining the cooked cereal in a form which will produce continuous shreds is only one of several problems which are encountered.<br>
[0025]	Cooking to eliminate white centers in grains is taught in U.S. Patent Nos. 2,421,216 and 4,734,294. In U.S. Patent No. 2,421,216, particles of cereal grains such KFHI-120 (42905)<br><br>
as corn, rye, wheat, bran, rice, or oat groats are composited with particles of de-fatted soya beans in the form of grits, flakes, or meal to enhance the protein content of the cereal by use of a two-stage pressure cooking step. The total cooking period to which the cereal component is subjected to should, according to U.S. Patent No. 2,421,216, be such that the starches are hydrolyzed and highly dextrinized and the particles superficially gelatinized with no free starch or white center. The cereal particles, it is taught, should also have a light adhesive action of the intermediately added soya bean particles. The mixed mass of cereal and soy which is removed from the cooker, is dried, then tempered for about 15 to 30 minutes before shredding in a shredding mill wherein the particles of soya become substantially uniformly spread out over and mixed with the cereal particles and adhered thereto by pressure through the shredding rolls. [0026]	U.S. Patent No. 4,734,294 discloses a process for the production of shredded oat food products, such as ready-to-eat breakfast cereals having the shredded appearance and texture of shredded whole wheat. White streaks or spots in the final product, which result from uncooked grain or overcooked grain, are eliminated by pressure cooking the oats in at least two stages, the amount of water used in the first pressure cooking stage being limited to partially gelatinize the starch without substantial extraction of water soluble starches and gums to the surface of the oat particles. The amount of water used in the remaining pressure cooking stage or stages is sufficient to eliminate at least substantially all of the white portions in the oat particles and to provide a water content in the oat particles which is sufficiently high to enable continuous KFHI-120 (42905)<br><br>
shredding on shredding rollers. Additionally, the amount of water in each of the remaining stages is limited to avoid substantial extraction of the gums and water soluble starches to the surface of the partially cooked oat particle.<br>
[0027]	In U.S. Patent No. 3,512,990 a dough, made from farinaceous materials such as wheat, corn, oats, rice, potatoes, or legumes, is optionally partially or completely cooked with added moisture, to an approximate moisture content of about 30%. After this cooking step, the mixture is rendered homogeneous by passing it through an extruder or a hammer mill, such as Fitzmiil. The milled or extruded product is dried to an approximate moisture content of 22 to 24%. The dried dough is then compacted between two rolls to provide a shredding effect and produce a sheet of dough having diamond-like regularly spaced perforations. The sheet of dough is then severed into strips, folded to form small biscuits which are closed on three sides and then deep fried.<br>
[0028]	In U.S. Patent Nos. 987,088, 1,019,831, and 1,021,473, corn or another grain is ground and immersed in an amount of water which is limited to that which will be taken up by the grain during cooking. The purpose of this is to preserve in the cooked article the aroma and other properties of the grain which might otherwise be carried off or dissipated by the evolution of steam or vapor. In these processes, the cooked dough is extruded through a perforated plate to obtain filaments.<br>
[0029]	In U.S. Patent No. 4,310,560 particulate edible materials, including at least one material which acquires surface stickiness when moistened and a chemical leavening KFHI-120 (42905)<br><br>
system are contacted with a spray of water and formed into pellets on a pelletizing disk. The edible material may include starches, such as those derived from wheat, corn, rice, potatoes, tapioca, and the like, including pregelatinized starches. The pellets are heated to a temperature sufficient to effect reaction of the leavening system to release carbon dioxide to provide the pellets with a porous cellular structure.<br>
[0030]	The present invention provides a method for the continuous, mass production of 100 % whole grain food products such as ready-to-eat cereals and thin, crispy, chip-like snacks in shredded form from non-glutenous or low-gluten content whole grains such as com, barley, rice, rye, oats, triticale, and mixtures thereof. The cooked, tempered whole grains are continuously shreddable into continuous net-like sheets even after prolonged tempering times or after prolonged periods in surge vessels after tempering during which substantial starch retrogradation may occur. The method of the present invention permits the use of fully cooked, tempered, but fracturable, hardened, rubbery whole cereal grain pieces in the continuous production of shredded products while achieving well defined shreds and a crisp texture and high fiber content. It is believed that in the process of the present invention, fracturing of at least substantially gelatinized, tempered starch granules to release amylose and amylopectin increases cohesiveness and softens whole cereal grain pieces for unexpectedly superior shreddability into continuous net-like sheets. Whole wheat shredded products having an enhanced crispy texture may also be produced using short temper times with excellent shreddability in accordance with the present invention. KFHI-120 (42905)<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0031]	The shreddability of retrograded, whole cereal grain particles for producing a whole grain shredded food product is unexpectedly improved by pelletizing agglomerates of cooked, tempered, whole cereal grain particles which have undergone retrogradation to a hard, rubbery, fracturable texture. The pelletization results in the production of whole grain pellets having a soft, pliable texture, which are shreddable into continuous net-like sheets on a mass production basis. In embodiments of the invention, the pelietizing may be at a pressure of about 200 psig to about 600 psig, preferably from about 400 psig to about 500 psig. The pelletizing temperature may be controlled to provide a pellet temperature of about 80°F to about 120°F, preferably from about 90°F to about 110°F, for example from about 95°F to about 105°F, upon exiting the pelletizer.<br>
[0032] Shearing and compaction of whole grains or pre-ground whole grains in the pelletizer softens and plasticizesthe starch matrix and generates sufficient friction and heat to make the whole grain particles pliable and ready for shredding while avoiding stickiness problems. It is believed that retrogradation of starch is reversed or starch granules are fractured releasing amylose and amylopectin during the pelletization process. As a result, the grain is shreddable for a longer period of time after cooking.<br>
[0033]	The process of the present invention provides versatility in terms of tempering times and post-tempering storage times for the production of nutritious, high fiber content, single whole grain or multi-whole grain shredded products. The shredded<br>
KFHI-120 (42905)<br><br>
products include whole grain shredded snacks and ready-to-eat cereals made from one or more non-glutenous or low-gluten whole grains such as whole corn grains, oats, barley, rice, triticale, and rye. The process may also be employed with whole wheat alone or in combination with other whole grains to provide an enhanced crispy texture.<br>
[0034]	In embodiments of the invention, a whole grain, shredded chip-like snack, preferably a 100% whole grain corn snack, having a substantially uniform shredded net-like appearance and a crisp, shredded texture is obtained by substantially compressing a laminate of net-like sheets of the shredded whole grain pellets.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0035]	The present invention provides a method for making shredded whole grain products, such as ready-to-eat cereals, and sweet and savory snacks, such as chips, crackers, wafers, biscuits, and other products. The products may be made with 100% whole grains and are an excellent source of whole grain nutrition and fiber. The difficulty with the shreddability of cooked and tempered grains, such as corn is overcome by subjecting the cooked and tempered grains to high shear. The high shear, it is believed, substantially fractures retrograded starch granules to increase cohesiveness for shreddability into continuous net-like sheets.<br>
[0036]	Cooked whole grains, such as corn and other non-gluten or low-gluten containing grains have a tendency to become hard and rubbery during the cooling and tempering process due to starch retrogradation. Shearing and compaction of grains in a KFHI-120 (42905)<br><br>
pelletizer has been found to unexpectedly soften and plasticize the starch matrix and generate friction and heat to make the whole grain particles pliable and readily shreddable without stickiness problems in the shredding roils. Starch retrogradation, it is believed, is reversed or amylose and amylopectin are released from the fractured starch granules during the pelletization process. As a result, the grain is shreddabie fora longer period of time after cooking.<br>
[0037]	In addition to use of a pelletizer, other means, such as double shredding, may be employed to shear the cooked, tempered, hardened whole cereal particles into soft, pliable, cohesive shreddable pieces. In double shredding, the hardened particles are first shred into discontinuous shreds, and then the discontinuous shreds are shred into continuous shreds. However, use of a pelletizer is preferred for more efficient production of continuous shreds.<br>
[0038]	Various whole cereal grains may be used to produce whole grain shredded products such as ready-to-eat breakfast cereals and chip-like shredded snacks in accordance with the present invention. Examples of grains which may be used are non-glutenous or low gluten content whole grains such as whole grain corn or corn kernels, oats or oat groats, barley, rye, rice, triticale, and mixtures thereof. A preferred whole grain for use in the present invention is corn. The com may be of the yellow, white or blue variety or mixtures thereof. High gluten content grains may also be shredded in accordance with the method of the present invention. For example, in embodiments of the invention, whole grain wheat, such as whole grain soft wheat, or wheat berries may KFHM20 (42905)<br><br>
be used alone or in combination with one or more non-glutenous or low gluten content whole grains. In embodiments of the invention, whole grains, which are at least partially or fully defatted, such as defatted whole wheat berries, may be used alone or in admixture with full-fatted whole grains. In the production of multi-grain products, each whole grain may be employed in equal weight percentages or in different weight percentages.<br>
[0039]	The whole cereal grain particles employed maybe in the form of the raw, whole, non-comminuted grain or berry or in the form of pre-cut, pre-ground, or comminuted whole grains. For example, the whole grain particles may be in the form of whole corn kernels, or pre-ground or comminuted corn kernels. Whole oat particles may be in the form of whole oat groats or berries, or pre-ground or pre-cut whole oat groats. The starch of the whole grain particles employed in the present invention may be all or essentially all individual, crystalline starch granules, as determined by light microscopy starch characterization where a sample is stained with Lugol’s Iodine and observed in Brightfield Optics.<br>
[0040]	In embodiments of the present invention pre-ground or comminuted whole cereal grains are preferred because they hydrate and cook faster than whole grains or whole berries. For example, prior to cooking, whole cereal grains, such as whole corn kernels, maybe pre-ground, milled or comminuted to a particle size of less than or equal to about 1/4 inch, preferably less than or equal to about 0.2 inch., for example from about 0.09 inch to about 0.165 inch. In embodiments of the invention, comminuting, pre-grinding or milling of raw whole grains may be achieved using a conventional Fitz mill, KFHI-120 (42905)<br><br>
Commitrol mill, or Urschel mill. For example, a Fitz Mill having a 1/8 inch round hole screen may be employed to obtain an average particle size distribution of about: 0.0 % on a #6 screen, about 14.91% on a #14 screen, about 30.43% on a #20 screen, about 50.25% on a #40 screen, and about 4.41% on the pan.<br>
[0041]	In embodiments of the present invention, whole seeds or comminuted seeds or legumes, such as soy beans or soy bean grits may be admixed with the cereal grains to enhance protein content of the products of the present invention in amount which do not adversely affect shreddability. Exemplary amounts of the seeds or legumes which maybe employed may range up to about 60% by weight, based upon the total weight of the whole cereal grains.<br>
[0042]	In preferred embodiments where the whole cereal grains include whole corn, lime is preferably employed to enhance flavor and also to enhance starch functionality and cohesiveness. Any food-grade lime or calcium hydroxide may be used in the present invention. The lime may be added in an amount sufficient to improve starch functionality and reduce tackiness of the corn-based composition, and to provide a masa flavor to the final product. Exemplary amounts of lime which may be used in embodiments of the present invention are from about 0.05% by weight to about 3% by weight, preferably from about 0.1% by weight to about 0.5 % by weight, based upon the weight of the whole corn grains or kernels.<br>
[0043]	The shredded whole grain foods such as ready-to-eat cereals, crackers, KFHI-120 (42905)<br><br>
wafers, biscuits, or snack chips of the present invention may be full-fatted, reduced fat, low-fat, or no-fat products. As used herein, a reduced-fat food product is a product having its fat content reduced by at least 25% by weight from the standard or conventional product A low-fat product has a fat content of less than or equal to three grams of fat per reference amount or label serving. However, for small reference amounts (that is, reference amounts of 30 grams or less or two tablespoons or less), a low-fat product has a fat content of less than or equal to 3 grams per 50 grams of product. A no-fat or zero-fat product has a fat content of less than 0.5 grams of fat per reference amount and per label serving. For accompaniment crackers, such as a saltine cracker, the reference amount is 15 grams. For crackers, or biscuits or wafers, used as snacks, and for cookies, the reference amount is 30 grams. Thus, the fat content of a low-fat cracker, wafer, or cookie would therefore be less than or equal to 3 grams of fat per 50 grams or less than or equal to about 6% fat, based upon the total weight of the final product. A no-fat accompaniment cracker would have a fat content of less than 0.5 grams per 15 grams or less than about 3.33%, based upon the weight of fee final product. A no-fat wafer having a label serving size of 32 grams would have a fat content of less than 0.5 grams per 32 grams or less than about 1.56% by weight, based upon the weight of the final product.<br>
[0044]	Oleaginous compositions which may be used in producing full-fat, reduced fat, or low-fat shredded products in accordance with the present invention may include any known shortening or fat blends or compositions useful for baking applications, and KFHI-120 (42905)<br><br>
they may include conventional food-grade emulsifiers. Vegetable oils, lard, marine oils, and mixtures thereof, which are fractionated, partially hydrogenated, and/or interesterified, are exemplary of the shortenings or fats which may be used in the present invention. Edible reduced- or low-calorie, partially digestible or non-digestible fats, fat-substitutes, or synthetic fats, such as sucrose polyesters or triacyl glycerides, which are process-compatible may also be used. Mixtures of hard and soft fats or shortenings and oils may be used to achieve a desired consistency or melting profile in the oleaginous composition. Exemplary of the edible triglycerides which can be used to obtain the oleaginous compositions for use in the present invention include naturally occurring triglycerides derived from vegetable sources such as soybean oil, palm kernel oil, palm oil, rapeseed oil, safflower oil, sesame oil, sunflower seed oil, and mixtures thereof. Marine and animal oils such as sardine oil, menhaden oil, babassu oil, lard, and tallow may also be used. Synthetic triglycerides, as well as natural triglycerides of fatty acids, may also be used to obtain the oleaginous composition. The fatty acids may have a chain length of from 8 to 24 carbon atoms. Solid or semi-solid shortenings or fats at room temperatures of, for example, from about 75°F to about 95°F may be used. Preferred oleaginous compositions for use in the present invention include partially hydrogenated soybean oil, palm oil, and mixtures thereof.<br>
[0045]	In embodiments of the invention, the amount of vegetable shortening or fat topically applied to shredded products may be reduced by more than 25 percent by weight to obtain reduced fat products having, for example, less than about 12 weight percent fat, KFHI-120 (42905)<br><br>
preferably less than 10% by weight fat, based on the total weight of the baked, finished product.<br>
[0046]	To provide a more lubricious mouthfeel to reduced fat, low-fat or no-fat products, a hydrocolloid gum, preferably guargum, may be employed to compensate for the fat reduction as disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,595,774 to Leibfred et al, the disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. As disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,595,774, the hydrocolloid gums are used in effective amounts which provide a lubricous, smooth, non-slippery mouthfeel to the baked product. Exemplary amounts of the hydrocolloid gum, preferably guar gum, which maybe used range from about 0.15% by weight to about 1.5% by weight, preferably from about 0.25% by weight to about 0.45% by weight, based upon the total weight of the whole berries or grains. Other gums which may be used with guar gum include xanthan gum and carboxymethyl cellulose, and gums which form gels such as alginate gum, carrageenan gum, gum arabic, gum tragacanth, pectin, and locust bean gum, and mixtures thereof. Generally, the greater the extent of shortening or fat reduction, the greater the amount of gum utilized to compensate for the loss of lubricity or loss of smoothness in mouthfeel.<br>
[0047]	In the method of the present invention, a whole grain shredded food product may be produced continuously on a mass production basis by admixing whole cereal grain particles with water and pressure cooking the whole grain particles to at least substantially gelatinize starch of the whole grain particles, and tempering the cooked, whole grain particles. The tempered, cooked, whole grain particles may be pelletized in KFHM20 (42905)<br><br>
a pelletizer to obtain whole grain pellets, the pelletizing being under pressure and temperature conditions to provide continuous shreddability of the whole grain pellets into continuous net-like sheets. The whole grain pellets may be shredded into whole grain net-like sheets, followed by laminating the whole grain net-like sheets to obtain a whole grain laminate. The whole grain laminate may be cut into whole grain pieces, followed by baking the whole grain pieces to obtain a whole grain shredded food product. In embodiments where a thin, chip-like shredded snack is produced, the whole grain laminate may be substantially compressed to obtain a compressed laminate having a shredded net-like appearance, followed by cutting the compressed laminate into pieces and baking of the pieces.<br>
[0048]	The cooking of the grain or berry according to this invention can be done in any standard cooking equipment, such as a rotary cooker, immersion cooker, or pressure cooker, such as a Lauhoff pressure cooker. Immersion cooking is generally at about atmospheric pressure or only about 2-3 psig. Pressure cooking is preferred because it quickly achieves full cooking or gelatinization of the whole grain particles with no, or essentially no white centers The whole grain particles may be cooked at temperatures and humidities which hydrate and at least substantially gelatinize the internal structure of the grains or berries such that only a pin head of white or free starch remains visible in the center of the kernel. In embodiments of the invention, the degree of gelatinization may for example, be at least 90%. In preferred embodiments the starch is essentially 100% gelatinized leaving no visible white centers in the whole grain particles. The degree of KFHI-120 (42905)<br><br>
starch geladnization may be measured by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Generally, starch gelatinization occurs when: a) water in a sufficient amount, generally at least about 25 to 30% by weight, based upon the weight of the starch, is added to and mixed with starch and, b) the temperature of the starch-water mixture is raised to at least about 80°C (176°F), preferably 100°C (212°F) or more. The gelatinization temperature depends upon the amount of water available for reaction with the starch. The lower the amount of available water, generally, the higher the gelatinization temperature. Gelatinization may be defined as the collapse (disruption) of molecular order within the starch granule, manifested in irreversible changes in properties such as granular swelling, native-crystallite melting, loss of birefringence, and starch solubilization. The temperature of the initial stage of gelatinization and the temperature range over which it occurs are governed by starch concentration, method of observation, granule type, and heterogeneities within the granule population under observation. Pasting is the second- stage phenomenon following gelatinization in the dissolution of starch. It involves increased granular swelling, exudation of molecular components (i.e. amylose, followed by amylopectin) from the granules, and eventually, total disruption of the granules. See Atwell et al, "The Terminology And Methodology Associated With Basic Starch Phenomena," Cereal Foods World. Vol. 33, No. 3, Pgs. 306-311 (March 1988).<br>
[0049]	Exemplary immersion cooking temperatures may range from about 190°F to about 212°F. Immersion cooking of the whole grain particles may occur at about 210°F at atmospheric pressure using steam for about 30 to about 36 minutes. The cooking can KFHI-120 (42905)<br><br>
include a "come-up time" of between 6.5 to about 8 minutes during which the temperature of the grain in the vat or cooking vessel is elevated from ambient temperature to the cooking temperature. But preferably, before cooking, the whole grain particles are added to hot water at a temperature of about 170° to 190°F in the cooker. The whole grain particles may be added to the hot water in a rotating cooker, for example, over a time period of about 50 to about 100 seconds.<br>
[0050]	The amount of water used in the immersion cooking step may range from about 28% by weight to about 70% by weight based upon the total weight of the grains or berries and added water. The moisture content of the cooked grain, after draining may range from about 29% by weight to about 60% by weight, preferably from about 29% by weight to about 42% by weight.<br>
[0051]	In preferred embodiments, where pressure cooking with direct steam injection is employed, pressure cooking temperatures may be at least about 235°F, preferably at least about 25 0°F, most preferably from about 268° F to about 275° F. Exemplary pressure cooking pressures may range from about 15 psig to about 30 psig, preferably from about 20 psig to about 28 psig with cooking times ranging from about 15 minutes to about 30 minutes, preferably from about 20 minutes to about 25 minutes. The pressure cooking may include a "come-up time" as in immersion cooking of between 6.5 to about 8 minutes during which the temperature of the grain in the vat or cooking vessel is elevated from ambient temperature to the cooking temperature. But preferably, before cooking, the whole grain particles are admixed with hot water at a temperature of KFHI-120 (42905)<br><br>
about 170° to 190°F in the pressure cooker. The whole grain particles may be added to the hot water, or vice versa, in a rotating cooker, for example, over a time period of about 50 to about 100 seconds. Other ingredients such, as salt, and lime in the case of corn grain cooking, may be added in the cooker with the water as a preblend or added separately.<br>
[0052]	Pressure cooking is preferred over immersion cooking because it provides better control over obtaining a desired water content in the cooked whole grain particles and reduces or eliminates the need for drying of the cooked grain particles to achieve a desired moisture content for shredding. Generally, in pressure cooking all of the water added is absorbed or taken up by the whole grain particles. In addition, steam which is directly injected into the pressure cooker condenses and is taken up by the whole grain particles, generally in an amount of about 1% by weight to about 3% by weight, based upon the total weight of the cooked whole grain particles. Generally, draining of water after pressure cooking is not needed because all or substantially all of the added water and steam condensate is taken up by the cooked whole grain particles.<br>
[0053]	The amount of water added in the pressure cooking step, not including steam condensate, may range from about 12% by weight to about 30% by weight based upon the total weight of the grains or berries and added water. The moisture content of the cooked grain, which includes water inherently present in the raw grain, after draining if needed, may range from about 29% by weight to about 42% by weight preferably from about 33% by weight to about 38% by weight, based upon the weight of the cooked whole grain particles. KFHI-120 (42905)<br><br>
[0054]	During cooking, moisture tends to collect on the grain particles or berries. This moisture can increase the stickiness of the cooked grain and can cause handling problems when the grain is transferred to other apparatus. Mixing the grain in the cooking vat at low rotation speeds provides for even cooking and reduces lumping.<br>
[0055]	After draining of any excess cooking water and steam condensate formed during cooking, the cooked whole grain particles may be discharged from the rotating cooker and optionally transferred to a surface dryer and cooler. In embodiments of the invention, the cooked whole grain particles may be dried and cooled to a temperature of less than about 125°F, for example from about 60°F to about 85°F. The surface drying and cooling facilitates flow of the cooked grains as individual, discrete pieces. The dried, cooled whole grain particles may have a moisture content of from about 29% by weight to about 42% by weight, preferably from about 33% by weight to about 38% by weight for shreddability into strong, continuous shreds.<br>
[0056]	In preferred embodiments, the cooked whole cereal grain particles are passed through a lump breaker to break apart large lumps or agglomerates of whole cereal grain particles. The de-lumped whole cereal grain particles may then be co-milled to obtain smaller agglomerates of whole cereal grain particles by passing through a screen, for example a 1 inch square screen. The co-milled agglomerates may range in size from about golf-ball sized to granular sized, preferably less than about 0.5 cm in diameter.<br>
[0057]	After cooking, the starch granules of the cooked whole cereal grain KFHI-120 (42905)<br><br>
particles are no longer crystalline in nature and are swollen or larger in size, as determined by light microscopy starch characterization using Lugol's Iodine. The cooked particles may contain swollen granules as well as agglomerated starch clusters.<br>
[0058]	The cooked whole cereal grain particles may then be conveyed to a surge bin or grit bin for tempering. The cooked whole grain particles may then be tempered or cured for a sufficient period of time to provide a uniform distribution of the water throughout the cooked whole grain particles. Tempering may be conducted at a temperature of less than about 125°F, preferably from about 75°F to about 100°F, more preferably from about 80°F to about 90°F. Tempering times may range from about 0.5 hours to about 5 hours, preferably from about 1 hour to about 4 hours. The tempering or curing step may be accomplished in one or more stages. The tempered whole grain particles may be in agglomerated form, with the agglomerates ranging in size from about golf-ball sized to granular sized, preferably less than about 0.5 cm in diameter.<br>
[0059]	In embodiments where a hydrocolloid gum is used, as disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,595,774, the hydrocolloid gum, preferably guar gum, in dry, particulate, or powdered form may be admixed or blended with the cooked, tempered whole grain particles. Batch or continuous mixers or blenders can be used to mix the gum and the cooked, tempered whole grain particles or agglomerates to coat them with the gum substantially homogeneously. The dry gum sticks or adheres to the cooked, tempered moist grains, thus at least partially coating the grains without creating a sticky surface which would hamper or interfere with shredding. Upon pelletizing and shredding of the KFHI-120 (42905)<br><br>
grains or berries, the gum coating or particles are incorporated into and onto the individual strands or net-like sheets of dough formed by the shredding rolls.<br>
[0060]	The cooked, tempered whole grain particles may be transferred by means of belt conveyers to a pelletizer for forming them into pellets for shredding. Upon entering the pelletizer, the tempered whole grain particles may be in the form of agglomerates. The agglomerates fed to the peiletizer may range in size from about golf-ball sized to granular sized, and may preferably be less than about 0.5 cm in diameter. They may have a temperature of less than about 125°F, preferably from about 75°F to about 100°F, more preferably from about 80°F to about 90°F. Upon entry into the pelletizer, the tempered, whole grain particles may have a hard or rubbery texture. The starch of the tempered whole grain particles may be retrograded, with the starch being primarily granular, the starch granules being swollen, and some agglomerated starch clusters being present, as determined using light microscopy starch characterization with Lugol's Iodine.<br>
[0061]	Commercially available extruders or pelletizers, such as a Bonnet or a Wenger pelletizer may be employed to produce the shreddable, whole grain pellets from the agglomerates of cooked, tempered whole grain particles in the present invention. The pelletizer may be equipped with a solid or cut-flight screw conveyer for conveying and shearing of the tempered whole grain particles from the input end to the output end and through the exit die plate. Cooling jackets are preferably provided to control the temperature of the agglomerates in the pelletizer and to control the temperature of the pellets exiting the pelletizer. The cooling jackets help to remove heat generated by the KFHI-120 (42905)<br><br>
shearing action occurring in the pelletizer and at the die plate as the agglomerates are forced through the die plate apertures.<br>
[0062]	The pelletizer may be equipped with an internal knife installed on the upstream side of an exit die plate, and an external knife installed on the downstream side of the exit die plate for forming the whole grain agglomerates into a rope or rod which is cut into whole grain pellets. In embodiments of the invention, the die plate may have a plurality of holes or apertures each having a diameter of about 3/16 inch to about 5/16 inch. The open area of the die plate, or the total area of the apertures as a percentage of the die plate area, may range from about 14% to about 55%, preferably from about 25% to about 45%, more preferably from about 38% to about 42%.<br>
[0063]	The whole grain pellets may be produced with dimensions for shredding on conventional shredding equipment. For example, the pellets may have a cut length of about 1/8 inch to about 1/4 inch, and a diameter of about 3/16 inch to about 5/16 inch imparted by the die apertures.<br>
[0064]	In accordance with the method of the present invention, the pelletizing pressure, as measured at the die plate, may be from about 200 psig to about 600 psig, preferably from about 400 psig to about 500 psig. The pressures and temperatures employed preferably result in no or substantially no expansion of the extrudate exiting the die orifices. Also, the temperature of the pellets exiting the pelletizer should be sufficiently low so that any increase in temperature caused by the shredding operation KFHI-120 (42905)<br><br>
does not result in deleterious sticking of the shreds to the downstream shredding rolls or compacting rolls.<br>
[0065]	Generally, the temperature of the shredded product out of the shredding rolls may be up to about 120°F to about 130°F without substantial sticking problems. The pelletizing temperature maybe controlled by use of the cooling jackets to provide a pellet temperature of from about 80°F to about 120°F, preferably from about 90°F to about 110°F, for example from about 95°F to about 105°F, upon exiting the pelletizer die plate. In embodiments of the invention, cooling air may be supplied at the exit of the plate to cool the exiting pellets to help avoid stickiness problems.<br>
[0066]	The pellets exiting the pelletizer have a soft, pliable, cohesive texture. The pelletization is believed to reverse retrogradation of the tempered whole grain particles. High shear in the pelletizer, it is believed, substantially fractures retrograded starch granules and releases amylose and amylopectin to increase cohesiveness for shreddability into continuous net-like sheets. While the starch entering the pelletizer may be primarily granular, it may be quite different in the pellets exiting the pelletizer. The starch of the whole grain pellets produced by the pelletizer is primarily agglomerated starch and fragmented starch with only a small population of individual granules, as determined using light microscopy starch characterization with Lugol's Iodine.<br>
[0067]	Upon exiting the pelletizer, the cooling of the pellets should not be so extensive, and the pellets should not be permitted to sit or temper too long, so as to KFHI-120 (42905)<br><br>
induce substantial starch retrogradation or pellet hardening which may impede shredd ability.<br>
[0068]	The whole grain pellets may preferably be immediately or quickly, for example within about 20 minutes, preferably within about 10 minutes, transported to the shredding operation so as to avoid any substantial hardening of or skin formation on the soft, pliable pellets. In embodiments of fee invention, the whole grain pellets may be transferred by means of belt conveyors and/or bucket elevators to a hopper which feeds a screw conveyor. The latter may transfer the whole grain pellets to a series of shredding rolls or mills via flow tubes or hoppers. An example of such a screw conveyor is that made by the Screw Conveyor Corporation, 704 Hoffman Street, Hammond, IN 46327. The moisture content of the whole grain pellets for shredding may range from about 29% by weight to about 42% by weight, preferably from about 33% by weight to about 38% by weight, based upon the weight of the pellets, for shreddability into strong, continuous shreds.<br>
[0069]	Any conventional milling system can be used in the present invention. A conventional milling system for making a wafer or biscuit may be employed in producing the shredded products such as ready-to-eat cereals, biscuits, and snack chips in accordance with the present invention. The conventional milling system can comprise a pair of closely spaced rolls that rotate in opposite directions with at least one of the rolls having circumferential grooves. Upon passing between the rolls, the dough is formed into long individual strings or strands. A circumferentially grooved roll can also be KFHI-120 (42905)<br><br>
grooved transversely to the circumferential grooves for the production of a net-like sheet. When sheets are formed, the sheets are comprised of interwoven shreds or strings. When the rolls are held tightly together, the shreds or filaments partially separate from each other but are more or less connected. When the rolls are sprung slightly apart under pressure, the adjacent filaments can be united to each other by very thin webs or fins which stretch between them.<br>
[0070]	Upon passing between the rolls, the dough is deformed into the circumferential grooves and the optional crosshatching grooves. Each pair of rolls produces a dough layer having a plurality of generally parallel longitudinal strands and optionally a plurality of crosshatchings generally perpendicular to the strands. The crosshatchings and the longitudinal strands form an integral net-like sheet The texture of each layer maybe controlled by the number of crosshatchings in each layer forming the net-like sheets. The net-like sheets are preferably unwebbed or webless, i.e., the crosshatchings and longitudinal strands of each layer are not connected by a membrane. The use of an open space within the area formed by the longitudinal strands and the crosshatchings in the outer layers provides a more attractive product. Additionally, use of the open space in the inner layers avoids an excessively dense texture.<br>
[0071]	The longitudinal strands are produced by the circumferential grooves and may run in parallel with the direction of movement of an underlying conveyor. The crosshatchings of the dough layer are produced by the crosshatching grooves and may run<br>
generally perpendicular to the direction of movement of the conveyor.<br>
KFHI-120 (42905)<br><br>
[0072]	The shredding mills may be arranged in a linear series along the common underlying conveyor. Each of the shredded dough layers or sheets maybe deposited on the conveyor in super-position, with their longitudinal strands running in the same direction.<br>
[0073]	Conventional shredding systems which can be used in the process of the present invention are disclosed in U.S. PatentNos. 502,378; 2,008,024; 2,013,003; 2,693,419; 4,004,035; and 6,004,612; and Canadian Patent No. 674,046.<br>
[0074]	The first and last one or more shredded dough layers to be deposited or laminated may have a number of crosshatchings so as to provide a region of denser texture or higher density in the biscuit or chip. The first layer which is laid down upon the conveyor belt preferably has a sufficient number of crosshatchings to provide a more stable bed for the depositing of subsequent shred layers. Additionally, the outside appearance of the product is enhanced by the presence of crosshatchings as is the initial impression of crispness upon eating. For a 5 inch diameter shredding roll, the number of crosshatchings may be about 45 or more, equally spaced about the roll. Five inch diameter rolls may generally have: (1) about 10 to 22 circumferential grooves per inch, and (2) up to about 120 equally spaced crosshatching grooves. Larger or smaller diameter rolls may also be used with about the same frequency of grooves as the five inch diameter rolls.<br>
[0075]	The dough layers which are deposited between the outer layers providing a<br><br>
denser texture or higher density may have a decreased number of crosshatchings so as to provide a region of lighter texture or lower density in the interior of the chip. The number of crosshatchings in each layer may be the same or different.<br>
[0076]	In embodiments of the invention, at least 30 percent of the total number of net-like sheets may provide one or more regions of dense texture or higher density. In preferred embodiments, each layer has the same number of cross-hatchings. In embodiments of the invention, for increased durability, crispness, and visual appearance, 120 crosshatchings for a five inch diameter roll is preferred.<br>
[0077]	The depth of the circumferential and cross-hatching grooves of the shredding rolls may be from about 0.010 inch to about 0.023 inch, preferably from about 0.016 inch to about 0.021 inch. For example, in preferred embodiments the cross-hatching groove depth maybe about 0.018 inch and the circumferential groove depth may be about 0.021 inch. Groove depths of less than about 0.010 inch tend to require too many layers to achieve a desired weight per piece. The net-like sheets when laminated upon one another, do not necessarily line up exactly so that one layer is superimposed exactly on another layer. The greater the number of layers, the more likely the openings in one net-like sheet will be at least partly covered by the shreds of another net-like sheet. Thus, increasing the number of layers to achieve a given piece weight tends to result in a denser laminate and loss of shred integrity upon compression in compression rolls. The use of groove depths greater than about 0.023 inch tends to result in too dense of a laminate which is difficult to bake out to a crisp, chip-like texture.<br>
KFHI-120 (42905)<br><br>
[0078]	Generally, the total number of net-like sheets may range from three to 21 depending upon the type and size of shredded product. For example, large sized ready-to-eat breakfast cereal biscuits or wafers may contain from about 6 to about 21 net-like sheets, preferably from about 8 to about 12 net-like sheets. Smaller sized ready-to-eat cereal biscuits or wafers may contain from 3 to 7, preferably from 4 to 6 net-like sheets. The snack chips of the invention may have 3 to 7, preferably 3 to 5, most preferably 4 net-like sheets. If the number of sheets is less than three, continuous, consistent production tends to be disrupted. The laminate tends to stick to or slip on the belt or compression roll upon substantial compression of a laminate which is relatively thin prior to compression. Additionally, with too few layers, the baked product tends to be too fragile for handling on mass production packaging equipment or for dipping. If the number of sheets or layers is greater than seven, upon compression to achieve a desirable, chip-like thinness, the laminate becomes too dense and difficult to bake out to a crispy texture. In addition, excessive compression may result in a loss of a distinctive, shredded appearance.<br>
[0079]	In embodiments of the invention for producing a shredded whole grain snack chip, or a thin, crisp ready-to-eat breakfast cereal, the whole grain laminate may be compressed in accordance with the method and apparatus of U.S. Patent No. 6,004,612 to Andreski et al for "Production of Shredded Snacks with Chip-Like Appearance and Texture/' the disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. The apparatus and method of U.S. Patent No. 6,004,612, may be used to obtain a whole grain KFHI-120 (42905)<br><br>
shredded chip-like snack having a substantially uniform shredded net-like appearance and crisp, shredded texture by substantially compressing a laminate of whole grain net-like sheets of whole grain pellets obtained in accordance with the present invention. As disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 6,004,612, the compression substantially reduces or eliminates air pockets or interlayer spacing and enhances interlayer adhesion so as to prevent the development of a puffed, pillowed, or thick biscuit or cracker-like appearance. Even though the laminate undergoes substantial compression, the substantially flat, unpuffed, chip-like products exhibit a substantially uniform shredded, net-like appearance upon their major surfaces. Additionally, individual shred layers are visually discernible in the baked product when it is broken and viewed in cross-section. The strength of the laminate is sufficient to continuously undergo cutting, transferring, and packaging operations during mass production without tearing or breaking. The baked chip-like shredded snacks are sufficiently strong for dipping into and scooping of dips or sauces without breaking. Additionally, the chips have a whole grain appearance, with portions of the hull or bran of the whole grains being visually apparent in numerous locations on the surface of the shredded snack chips.<br>
[0080]	In embodiments of the invention, prior to compression, the thickness of the whole grain laminate may generally range from about 0.070 inch to about 0.250 inch. Generally, the thickness of the laminate is reduced by at least about 35%, generally from about 45% to about 60% of its thickness prior to compression. As disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 6,004,612, compression of the laminate to substantially reduce its thickness<br><br>
KFHI-120 (42905)<br><br>
may be achieved bypassing it between at least one pair of counterrotating compression rolls while it is supported upon and transported by a conveyer belt. Where more than one pair of compression rolls are employed, the total thickness reduction may be approximately equally divided between the pains of rolls. Use of a single pair of counterrotating compression rolls is preferred for achieving the substantial compression of the laminate.<br>
[0081]	Supporting the laminate upon a belt while it is being compressed helps to avoid excessive stretching and tearing or sticking of the laminate during compression and transport through the rolls. As disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 6,004,612, each pair of counterrotating rolls may comprise a top roll which contacts the top surface of the laminate, and a bottom roll which contacts the bottom surface of the conveyer belt which supports the laminate. The nip or gap between the counterrotating rolls and their relative rotational speeds are set so as to substantially compress the laminate while avoiding: 1) substantial sticking of the laminate to the upper roll, or 2) substantial movement or slippage of the laminate relative to the belt, either of which would substantially disrupt or distort the shred pattern of the laminate as it is compressed. The bottom roll helps to maintain the linear speed of the separately driven conveyer belt as the top roll compresses the laminate against the top surface of the belt. The rotational speeds of the top and bottom rolls of a pair of counterrotating rolls may be at least substantially the same, or essentially the same, depending upon the relative diameters of the rolls. If different diameter rolls are used, their rotational speeds, or angular velocities, may be adjusted to<br><br>
KFHI-120 (42905)<br><br>
provide at least substantially the same linear velocity.<br>
[0082]	As disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 6,004,612, the laminate is compressed by the counterrotating rolls without cutting of the laminate or without molding of the laminate into individual pieces. The compression or thickness reduction is at least substantially uniform across the width of the laminate. The compression provides a thin, cooked, but dough-like compressed laminate and helps to prevent substantial puffing or expansion upon subsequent baking. The thickness of the compressed laminate exiting the nip of the compression rolls is such so as to provide a thin, chip-like appearance upon baking.<br>
[0083]	In embodiments of the present invention, generally the thickness of the compressed laminate may range from about 0.035 inch to about 0.120 inch, preferably from about 0.050 inch to about 0.100 inch, for example from about 0.060 inch to about 0.080 inch.<br>
[0084]	Even though the thickness of the laminate is substantially reduced, a substantially uniform shred pattern is visually apparent upon the opposing major surfaces of the baked product. Additionally, at least substantially all, or all of the individual shred layers are generally visible to the naked eye upon breaking a baked piece perpendicularly to its major surfaces. For example, if a baked piece is broken in about half, a cross-sectional viewing of each piece may generally reveal the same number, or substantially the same number, of shred layers or net-like sheets as were present prior to compression.<br>
KFHI-120 (42905)<br><br>
[0085]	The moisture content of the laminate prior to compression and after compression is generally at least substantially the same. Moisture contents of the laminate prior to and after compression may range from about 29% by weight to about 42% by weight, preferably from about 33% by weight to about 38% by weight. The starch of the laminates may be in the form of agglomerated starch clusters with virtually no individual starch granules, as determined using light microscopy starch characterization with Lugol's Iodine.<br>
[0086]	The whole grain laminates of shredded dough strands, layers or net-like sheets may then be cut, and slit using conventional equipment, such as rotary cutters and slitters. Dockering of the laminate is not necessary to prevent puffing or leavening. A non-dockered piece is preferable because it is more chip-like in appearance. Also, dockering of a compressed laminate tends to produce excessively dense portions which are difficult to bake out without scorching.<br>
[0087]	The cutting operation may partially or completely cut the whole grain laminates into strips. The slitting operation may completely cut or score the strips so as to provide scored strips of unbaked ready-to-eat cereal biscuits or snacks with the unbaked biscuits or snacks tenuously connected to each other. In embodiments of the invention, the non-compressed or the compressed whole grain laminate may be edge trimmed and then partially cut into shaped pieces by a rotary cutter without substantial generation of scrap or recycle material. Then, the partially-cut laminate may be cut longitudinally in the<br>
KFHI-120 (42905)<br><br>
direction of movement of the conveyer belt, and then transversely to the direction of movement of the conveyer belt without substantial generation of scrap or recycle material. After baking and before or after oil addition to the strips, the conveyor movement, etc., breaks apart the scored strips to provide individual pieces of shredded product such as ready-to-eat cereals, biscuits, wafers, or chip-like snacks.<br>
[0088]	The shape of the shredded products may be square, round, rectangular, elliptical, parallelepiped, triangular and the like. Shapes which minimize or eliminate waste or recycle are preferred. A most preferred shape for a chip-like snack is a triangular or substantially triangular shape. As disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 6,004,612, to essentially eliminate waste, the triangles may be formed using a rotary cutter which cuts the compressed laminate so that the base of each triangle is parallel to the longitudinal axis or direction of movement of the laminate. To reduce breakage during and after cutting, the laminate is preferably cut so that the apex or point of a triangle in one row does not touch or intersect the apex or point of another triangle located in an adjacent row. In preferred embodiments, the cutter may cut the laminate into a plurality of longitudinal rows of triangular-shaped pieces so that the apex of a triangular piece of one row is located at or intersects about the midpoint of the base of a triangular piece of an adjacent row as shown in U.S. Patent No. 6,004,612.<br>
[0089]	As disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 6,004,612, it is also preferable to form or cut the triangular pieces with rounded, blunted or flat corners so as to eliminate sharp points which may break-off during rotary cutting or subsequent slitting or transferring of<br>
KFHI-120 (42905)<br><br>
the cut laminate. For example, vacuum may be used for lifting and transferring a partially cut laminate from one conveyer belt to another. The presence of substantial amounts of broken-off points may clog the vacuum equipment. One or more, preferably all three corners or apexes of the triangular pieces may be rounded, flattened or blunted. For example, to obtain flattened or blunted corners on a substantially equilateral or isosceles triangular shaped piece, each corner may be formed, cut, or shaped at least substantially parallel to its opposing side or at least substantially perpendicular to an adjacent side by the rotary cutter.<br>
[0090]	The cut, whole grain laminate may be dried, baked and toasted in conventional equipment. Suitable ovens for drying, baking and toasting the cut laminate include Proctor &amp; Schwartz, Werner-Lehara, Wolverine and spooner ovens containing forced air and gas fired burners and a conveyor. The laminates may be toasted to enhance the flavor and brown the edges of the shredded products. Baking of compressed laminates does not substantially puff or leaven them and provides a substantially flat, thin, chip-like appearance.<br>
[0091]	Temperature profiles used in the oven for drying, baking and toasting of the laminated preforms may generally be within the range of about 200° to about 600°F. The baking is preferably performed in a zoned oven using low oven velocity to avoid excess curling, separating or warping of the strips during baking. The total time for drying, baking and toasting may be such so as to avoid browning (except on the edges of the pieces). It depends upon the number of shred layers, the size of the shredded product and<br>
KFHI-120 (42905)<br><br>
the type of oven. The total time for drying, baking and toasting may range from about 3 minutes to about 10 minutes. After baking, the starch of the products may be in the form of agglomerated starch clusters with virtually no individual starch granules, as determined using light microscopy starch characterization with Lugol's Iodine.<br>
[0092]	The color of the final baked product can be a substantially uniform off- white to golden tan color. The product may be topped with salt (for example, 0.5 to 2 weight percent, based on the total product weight) prior to baking. The salt provides flavor and flavor enhancement. Some of the salt (NaCl) can be replaced with KC1 or other salt substitutes.<br>
[0093]	The fat or shortening, when used in embodiments of the invention can be applied, preferably by spraying in oil form, to the top and bottom surfaces of baked strips of snacks having no added fat or having only fat inherent in the cereal grain. For example, whole wheat berries generally have an inherent fat content of about 2% to 4% by weight. See, Wheat: Chemistry and Technology, Vol. II, Pomeranz, ed.3 Amer. Assoc. of Cereal Chemists, Inc., St Paul, MN, p. 285 (1988). In embodiments of the invention, the topical application of oil to baked snacks having no other added fat may result in baked products having a total fat content of less than about 12%, preferably less than about 10% by weight. In other embodiments the amount of topically applied oil may be less than about 8% by weight, for example less than about 6% by weight, based upon the weight of the chip-like, shredded snack. Use of a hydrocolloid gum provides for obtaining a slippery or smooth mouthfeel and a glossy appearance even with no added fat.<br>
KFHI-120 (42905)<br><br>
[0094]	The whole grain shredded products of the present invention may contain one or more additives (e.g., vitamins, minerals, colorants, flavorants, etc.) at effective levels of concentration. Exemplary thereof are sugars such as sucrose, fructose, lactose, dextrose, and honey, polydextrose, dietary fiber, seasonings, such as onion, garlic, parsley, and bouillon, malt, wheat germ, nuts, cocoa, flavorants such as fruit flavoring, cracker flavoring, cinnamon, and vanilla flavoring, acidulants such as citric acid and lactic acid, preservatives such as TBHQ, antioxidants such as tocopherol and BHT, food colorant, emulsifiers such as Myvatex® (a blend of distilled monoglycerides manufactured by Eastman Kodak), sodium stearoyl lactylate, lecithin, and polysorbate 60, and vitamins and/or minerals. Examples of suitable vitamins and minerals include B- complex vitamins, soluble iron compounds, calcium sources such as calcium carbonate, vitamin A, vitamin E, and vitamin C. Also, non-fat dry milk solids (i.e., milk powder) or soybean protein may be added in an amount sufficient to create a final protein level of from about 10 to about 20 weight percent. Such additional ingredients may range up to about 30 weight percent, based on the total dry weight of the final product.<br>
[0095]	The additives, such as vitamins and minerals, maybe dry blended with an optional hydrocolloid gum and then the dry blend may be admixed with the cooked, tempered whole grain particles. In other embodiments, enrichment with vitamins and minerals and/or other additives may be achieved by blending with the blended grain and optional gum mixture. For example, a dry multi-vitamin premix may be added with simultaneous mixing to a gum coated grain mixture at the entry of a screw conveyor to<br>
KFHI-120 (42905)<br><br>
form a homogeneous composition. The resulting composition may be fed or dropped into a hopper, which supplies milling rolls. The multi-vitamin and optionally gum-coated grain composition may then be milled in shredding rolls and formed into shredded products.<br>
[0096]	Additives or fillings, particularly those which may adversely affect shredding, may also be incorporated into the shredded baked goods of the present invention by depositing them between shred layers during formation of the dough laminate. Sucrose, fructose, lactose, dextrose, polydextrose, fiber, milk powder, cocoa, and flavorants arc exemplary of additives which may be deposited. Exemplary fillings for inter-shred layer deposition include fruit paste fillings, no-fat cheese powder fillings, confectionery fillings, and the like. The additives or fillings may be full-fatted, no-fat, reduced-fat or low-fat.<br>
[0097]	Additives may also be topically applied to the laminated structure before or after baking. In the production of whole grain shredded snacks, additives are preferably topically applied rather than applied between layers so as to not adversely affect a thin, chip-like appearance. Topically applied oil may be used as a carrier for one or more additives, such as flavorants or seasonings. Topical application of additives may be achieved using conventional dispensing apparatus such as disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,707,448 to Cordera etal, for "Apparatus for the Application of Particulates to Baked Goods and Snacks," the disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.<br>
KFHI-120 (42905)<br><br>
[0098]	Products of the present invention may have a moisture content of less than about 5% by weight, preferably about 0.5 to about 3 weight percent, more preferably about 1 to 2 weight percent, based on the total weight of the baked, finished product. The final product may be baked to a shelf stable relative humidity or "water activity" of less than about 0.7, preferably less than about 0.6. It may have a shelf stability of at least about 2 months, preferably at least about 6 months, when stored in proper, sealed packaging.<br>
[0099]	The following examples further illustrate the present invention wherein all parts and percentages are by weight and all temperatures are in °F, unless otherwise indicated:<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br><br><br>
whole grain corn using a 1/8 inch round holes screen. The water, salt and lime may be pre-mixed and added to a Lauhoff rotary steam pressure cooker. The water temperature may be about 170°F - 190°F. Then, the Fitzmilled whole corn may be added to the rotating cooker within about 60-70 seconds. The mass in the cooker may then be heated with steam and cooked for about 23 minutes at a pressure of about 26 psig and a temperature of about 268°F to about 275°F to fully gelatinize the starch of the whole grain corn particles.<br>
[0102]	The cooked whole grain corn particles may then be discharged from the rotating cooker, passed through a lump breaker, and then Comilled using a 1 inch square screen to obtain whole corn grain agglomerates. The agglomerates may then be conveyed to a grit bin or curing (tempering) tank. The cooked whole grain agglomerates may be tempered in the grit bin up to 3 hours, with a target tempering time of about 2 hours. The cooked, tempered whole grain particles may have a moisture content of about 35% by weight to about 38% by weight, preferably about 36.5% by weight for shredding.<br>
[0103]	The tempered whole grain agglomerates may be transferred to a Bonnet pelletizer having a solid or cut flight screw, internal and external knives, and a die plate having 1/4 inch or 5/16 inch apertures and an open die area of about 3 8% to about 42%. The tempered agglomerates may be formed into pellets at a pressure of about 450 psig to about 550 psig. The pelletizer cooling unit may be set to about 40°F to cool the jacket of the pelletizer so the pellets exiting the pelletizer have a pellet temperature of about 105°F to avoid potential stickiness issues at the downstream shredder, triangular cutter head, and<br>
KFHI-120 (42905)<br><br>
smooth compression roll. Air may be introduced at the die cutter to disperse the pellets. The whole grain pellets obtained from the pelletizer are soft, pliable and coherent, and may have a length of about 1/8 inch to about 1/4 inch and a diameter of about 1/4 inch to about 5/16 inch.<br>
[0104]	The discrete, free flowing whole grain pellets may then be conveyed to a surge hopper for feeding to four shredding mills which are arranged in a linear series along a common conveyor. Each shredding mill may comprise a pair of counterrotating rolls held in mutual contact for the production of net-like sheets. The rolls of the four mills may each have a groove depth of about 0.018 inch to 0.021 inch and 120 cross-hatching grooves.<br>
[0105]	The net-like cereal dough sheets produced by the shredding mills may be continuously deposited upon a continuous conveyor belt to form a four layer whole grain laminate having a thickness of about 1/8 of an inch. The four layer laminate, while supported on the conveyer belt may be continuously compressed between smooth surfaced, non-grooved, stainless steel counterrotating compression rolls as disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 6,004,612. The compression rolls may have the same diameter and may be driven by a common drive at the same rotational speed. The linear speed of each compression roll may be the same and the linear speed of the belt may be about 1% slower than the linear speed of the compression rolls. The compression rolls may be moved or maintained in position by the use of air cylinders Air cylinder pressures of about 60 psi to 80 psi may be used to maintain a desired gap between the rolls as the belt<br>
KFHI-120 (42905)<br><br>
and laminate continuously pass between the counterrotating compression rolls. The gap between the upper roll surface and the top surface of the conveyer belt may be from aboi 0.06 inch to about 0.08 inch to obtain a compressed laminate having a thickness of aboul 0.06 inch to about 0.08 inch.<br>
[0106]	The moisture content of the laminate prior to compression and the moistun content of the compressed laminate may be about 35% by weight to about 38% by weigh preferably about 36.5% by weight.<br>
[0107]	The compressed laminate maybe conveyed to an edge trimmer to trim the longitudinal edges. The trimmed, compressed laminate may then be conveyed to a rotarj cutter having a plurality of circumferential rows of Teflon® coated triangular cutting or forming elements. The elements may partially cut or form the compressed laminate into rows of isosceles triangle shaped preforms having blunted or flattened corners. The triangular preforms are joined at their peripheries by a thin layer of dough resulting from only partially cutting or scoring of the compressed laminate. The partially cut compressed laminate may then be cut or slit longitudinally, and then cut transversely to the direction of movement of the laminate to form strips of scored, triangular dough preforms.<br>
[0108]	The whole grain compress laminate may be transferred to a multizone band oven for drying, baking and toasting for about 5 to 7.5 minutes at temperatures ranging from about 200°F to about 600°F. The baked product leaving fee oven may have an end<br>
KFHI-120 (42905)<br><br>
point moisture content of about 2% by weight, based upon the weight of the final product. [0109]	After exiting the oven, the baked product strips maybe oiled and seasoned in a seasoning drum or tumbler. Soybean oil may be topically applied as a fine spray to the top and bottom of the baked snack preform strips, followed by the application of sweet or savory seasonings.<br>
[0110]	The baked preform strips may then be conveyed to packaging in a manner so that the scored strips of triangular snacks readily separate at the score line by motion, bumping, etc., into individual snack pieces. The snack pieces may be isosceles triangle shaped with blunted or flattened corners. The base may be about 1.7 inches long, and the two sides may each be about 1.6 inches long. The two blunted side portions perpendicular and adjacent to the base may each be about 0.1 inch long. The blunted side portion parallel to and opposite the base may be about 0.16 inch to about 0.30 inch long. The thickness of the baked snack piece may be about 1/16 inch. The baked snack pieces may have a thin, flat, chip-like appearance and crisp, chip-like texture. The top and bottom major surfaces may have a substantially uniform shred pattern or embossed or woven, shredded appearance and texture. Upon breaking the baked snack chips, the four shred layers may be seen by the naked eye in cross-section. The snack chips may be used for hand-to-mouth snacking and may be used for dipping without breakage.<br><br>

[0112]	The pre-ground long grain brown rice may be prepared by Fitzmilling raw whole grain long grain brown rice using a 1/8 inch round holes screen. The water and salt may be pre-mixed and added to a Lauhoff rotary steam pressure cooker. The water temperature maybe about 170°F - 190°F. Then, the Fitzmilled whole rice may be added to the rotating cooker within about 60-70 seconds. The mass in the cooker may then be heated with steam and cooked for about 20 minutes at a pressure of about 20 psig and a temperature of about 268°F to about 275 °F to fully gelatinize the starch of the whole grain rice particles.<br>
[0113]	The cooked whole grain rice particles may then be discharged from the rotating cooker, passed through a lump breaker, and then Comilled using a 1 inch square screen to obtain whole grain rice agglomerates. The agglomerates may then be conveyed to a grit bin or curing (tempering) tank. The cooked whole grain agglomerates may be tempered in the grit bin for 1 to 4 hours, with a target tempering time of about 2 hours.<br>
KFHI-120 (42905)<br><br>
The cooked, tempered whole grain particles may have a moisture content of about 35% by weight for shredding.<br>
[0114]	The tempered whole grain agglomerates may be transferred to a Bonnet pelletizer having a solid or cut flight screw, internal and external knives, and a die plate having 3/16 inch apertures and an open die area of about 38% to about 42%. The tempered agglomerates may be formed into pellets at a pressure of about 450 psig to about 600 psig. The pelletizer cooling unit may be set to about 40°F to cool the jacket of the pelletizer so the pellets exiting the pelletizer have a pellet temperature of about 95°F to about 105°F to avoid potential stickiness issues at the downstream shredder, triangular cutter head, and smooth compression roll. Air may be introduced at the die cutter to disperse the pellets. The whole grain pellets obtained from the pelletizer are soft, pliable and coherent, and may have a length of about 1/8 inch to about 1/4 inch and a diameter of about 3/16 inch.<br>
[0115]	The discrete, free flowing whole grain pellets may then be shred into a whole grain laminate, compressed, rotary cut, baked, seasoned, and packaged as in Example 1.<br>

The mass in the cooker may then be heated with steam and cooked for about 20 minutes at a pressure of about 20 psig and a temperature of about 268°F to about 275°F to fully gelatinize the starch of the whole grain oats particles.<br>
[0118]	The cooked whole grain oats particles may then be discharged from the rotating cooker, passed through a lump breaker, and then Comilled using a 1 inch square screen to obtain whole grain oats agglomerates. The agglomerates may then be conveyed to a grit bin or curing (tempering) tank. The cooked whole grain agglomerates may be tempered in the grit bin for 1 to 4 hours, with a target tempering time of about 2 hours. The cooked, tempered whole grain particles may have a moisture content of about 32% by weight for shredding.<br>

minutes at a pressure of about 20 psig and a temperature of about 268°F to about 275°F to fully gelatinize the starch of the multi-whole grain particles.<br>
[0122]	The cooked multi-whole grain particles may then be discharged from the rotating cooker, passed through a lump breaker, and then Comilled using a 1 inch square screen to obtain multi-whole grain agglomerates. The agglomerates may then be conveyed to a grit bin or curing (tempering) tank. The cooked multi-whole grain agglomerates maybe tempered in the grit bin for 1 to 4 hours, with a target tempering time of about 2 hours.
