FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates in general to telecommunication systems and<br>
methods for their management, and particularly to systems and methods for<br>
efficiently managing packet switched communication.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The ever-growing traffic load in communication networks has been realized for<br>
quite some time as a problem that requires a solution. To date, some solutions<br>
were suggested to the problem. One such solution was suggested in US<br>
20030012137 that describes a packet network congestion control system using a<br>
biased packet discard policy. Once a connection and session are established,<br>
compressed voice and data packets start flowing between the two end points of<br>
the path. A control entity supplies congestion control packets periodically. The<br>
control packets provide a "heartbeat" signal to the codec at the other end of the<br>
session. Each codec receiver uses the "heartbeat" signal as an processing<br>
indication of network congestion. As network congestion increases, routers<br>
within the network discard excess packets to prevent network failure. The<br>
network discards all packets classified as congestion control packets whenever a<br>
flow control mechanism detects congestion or a trend toward congestion As<br>
packets are discarded, the end points renegotiate codec type and/or parameters<br>
to realize lower bit rates.<br>
WO 0057606 describes a method for discarding data within an IP-network<br>
communications link. Initially, the	<br><br>
IP-network communications link is monitored to determine the occurrence of an<br>
overload condition. At least some of the data packets transmitted along the IP-<br>
network communications link are selected in response to detection of the<br>
overload condition, and the selected data packets are discarded from the link,<br>
while the remainder of the packets are transmitted. When packets of real-time<br>
flow sessions are concerned, the selected data packets are those having the<br>
same source and destination IP addresses and source and destination ports, and<br>
consisting of encapsulated video, audio, etc. signals. Discarding these packets<br>
from that link allows that only a single or a few real-time flow sessions are<br>
eliminated from the link, while the remaining links' sessions are unaffected.<br>
US 6091709 discloses a packet router which is provided with priority services of<br>
the type required for isochronous handling of data representing real-time voice,<br>
includes a Quality of Service (QoS) management system for ensuring that<br>
guarantees associated with such priority service can be met with a high degree<br>
of certainty. This management system provides prioritized queues including a<br>
highest priority queue supporting reservations for the priority service suited to<br>
isochronous handling. The highest priority queue and other queues are closely<br>
monitored by a QoS manager element for states of near congestion and critical<br>
congestion. While neither state exists, filler packet flows are promoted from<br>
lower priority queues to the highest priority queue, in order to keep the latter<br>
queue optimally utilized. If all lower priority queues are empty at such times,<br>
dummy packets which will be discarded by stations receiving them, are inserted<br>
as filler flows. When a state of near congestion exists, the QoS manager demotes<br>
filler flow units from the highest	<br><br>
priority queues to lower priority queues, in order to lessen the potential<br>
forwarding delays presented to real traffic occupying the highest priority queue.<br>
When a state of critical congestion exists in the highest priority queue, admission<br>
of new incoming traffic flows to that queue is suspended and forwarding of filler<br>
flows from that queue out to the network is also suspended.<br>
The following publications were published as Requests For Comments (RFCs) by<br>
the Internet Society for the establishment of an international standard DiffServ:<br>
RFC 2474 "Definition of the Differentiated Services Field (DS Field) in the Ipv4<br>
and Ipv6 Headers", by K. Nichols et al., December 1998; RFC 2475 "An<br>
Architecture for Differentiated Services", by S. Blake et al., December 1998; RFC<br>
2597 "Assured Forwarding PHB Group". By J. Heinanen et al., June 1999; RFC<br>
2836 "Per Hop Behavior Identification Codes", by D. Black et al. June 2001; and<br>
RFC 3260 "New Terminology and Clarifications for Diffserv" by D. Grossman,<br>
April 2002.<br>
However, as may be appreciated, these solutions are either directed to solve<br>
overload problems or to ensure quality of service. However, none of these<br>
publications disclose how to carry out different processing of various packets for<br>
their parts, if applicable) belonging to the same signal, so as to allow optimizing<br>
the network resources.<br>
In our co-pending application, IL 160921, a method for managing varying traffic<br>
load in a packet switched communication network is disclosed. By this method<br>
the active channels carrying traffic are divided into groups and a rate adjusting<br>
mechanism is applied thereon when the available bandwidth is less than the<br>
bandwidth required. The application of the rate adjusting mechanism is done<br>
while ensuring that a substantially equalized	....<br><br>
signal quality is maintained for traffic delivered via all of the active channels<br>
belonging to certain group (s).<br>
Still, even this solution does have certain drawbacks as it is more suitable for<br>
actions to be taken near a point where the rate adjustment is applied on the<br>
delivered traffic, and does not necessarily provide a solution that ensures certain<br>
quality to certain channels and/or signals further downstream.<br>
WO 02/15488 describes a method for extracting information for classifying<br>
packets from the packet header in order to establish, based on the extracted<br>
information, different levels of quality of service for different data flows being<br>
transported over a data link.<br>
The article entitled "Audio Content Analysis for Online Audiovisual data<br>
Segmentation and Classification" by T. Zhang and J. Kuo, IEEE Transactions on<br>
Speech and Audio Processing, Vol. 9, No. 4, May 2001, discloses an audio<br>
content analysis for online audiovisual data segmentation and classification. The<br>
purpose of the disclosure is to allow automatic segmentation, indexing, and<br>
retrieval of audiovisual data to facilitate the retrieval of desired video segments.<br>
EP 1,227,624 describes a QoS monitoring system having a network element that<br>
is organized as a plurality of terminating line cards interconnected via a switch<br>
fabric capable of supporting virtual ingress/egress pipes (VIEPs). Buffer queues<br>
on the ingress and egress sides of the network element, which are established<br>
for supporting traffic flows on individual VIEPS, are monitored for determining<br>
QoS parametric information such as throughout, loss, delay, jitter and available<br>
bandwidth, so that the monitoring of the PIPE traffic reflects the conformance of<br>
the service provider to their customers. US 6,650,644 describes a method for<br>
translating the	<br><br>
quality of service (QOS) of a data packet. An incoming type of service (TOS) mask word<br>
is generated by masking a header field of the data packet with a TOS mask, and a QOS<br>
lookup table is searched for a QOS translation using the TOS value as a key value.<br>

specification are hereby incorporated herein by reference.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a method for improving the<br>
managing of packet switched networks.<br>
It is yet another object of the present invention to provide a system and an apparatus<br>
capable of managing telecommunication traffic load in accordance with the availability of<br>
the system resources.<br>
It is still a further object of the present invention to provide a method and apparatus for<br>
optimizing the processing of signals under different network resources' constrains.<br>
Other objects of the invention will become apparent as the description of the invention<br>
proceeds.<br>
In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a<br>
method for processing a packet conveyed in a packet switched communication network.<br>
The method comprises associating the packet with a processing indication to allow its<br>
processing, and wherein the indication is determined in accordance with parameters<br>
associated with the packet's payload and/or the payload of its neighboring packets, with<br>
the signal	.<br><br>
classification, etc. This indication may refer to the processing of all the<br>
information comprised in the packet or in the alternative to information<br>
comprised in part of the packet. By another alternative, the indication may relate<br>
to both information comprised in the whole packet as well as to partcular<br>
information comprised in part of the packet, while these processing instructions<br>
are used in accordance with the applicable conditions. For example, under<br>
certain load conditions the processing instructions which relate to information<br>
comprised in the whole packet will be used, while under different load conditions<br>
the processing instructions which relate to part of the packet will be applied, and<br>
the information comprised in the remaining part of the packet may either be<br>
processed in accordance with a default procedure, or not processed at all.<br>
In accordance with another embodiment of the present invention there is<br>
provided a method for processing a signal comprising a plurality of packets that<br>
is being forwarded in a packet switched communication network. The method<br>
comprises providing to at least one packet out of the plurality of packets with a<br>
first processing indication to allow processing of that at least one packet and<br>
providing at least one other packet out of the plurality of packets with a second<br>
processing indication to allow a different processing of the at least one other<br>
packet.<br>
The term "packet" as used herein, should be understood also to encompass both<br>
a full packet as well as a part of a packet. For example, the first and second<br>
processing indications referred to hereinbefore may relate each to a part of a<br>
packet, so that the processing that should take place in accordance with the<br>
appropriate processing indication, shall be carried out for the	..<br><br>
respective part of the packet, while the remaining of the packet may either be<br>
processed in accordance with a default processing method applied in that packet<br>
switched communication network (e.g. a default defined per the signal type) or<br>
alternatively can remain unprocessed.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the signal is a multimedia<br>
signal. Preferably, it is a video type of signal.<br>
By yet another embodiment, the present invention also encompasses cases<br>
whereby different processing indications may be associated with different parts<br>
of a single packet. For example, let us consider a voice type signal which is<br>
typically associated with high priority according to prior art packet switched<br>
systems. The present invention provides by this embodiment the use of different<br>
processing indication(s) that are associated with certain packets or parts of<br>
packets that do not carry important information, or carry relatively less important<br>
information than their neighbors. Thus, according to this processing indication<br>
(or processing indications), even though the signal to which these packets (or<br>
part (s) thereof) belong, is provided with high priority, still they some times be<br>
discarded downstream if required, e.g. under congestion conditions, etc. In other<br>
words, there could be cases where certain packets will be processed in<br><br>
accordance with the high priority provided for the signal to which they belong,<br>
while other packets, belonging to the very same signal will be processed<br>
differently, in accordance with the indications associated therewith.<br>
The term "packet switched communication network" as will be used hereinafter,<br>
should be understood to encompass the various types of networks known in the<br>
art, such as synchronous and asynchronous transfer networks,	<br><br>
for example ATM networks, Ethernet networks, IP networks, frame relaying<br>
networks, Metropolitan Area Networks (MAN), Wide Area Networks (WAN), Local<br>
Area Network (LAN), packet over SONET/SDH networks, and the like.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the processing<br>
indication comprises at least one bit. Preferably, the processing indication is a<br>
result of any combination comprising at least one member of the group that<br>
consists of:<br>
1)	minimum quality of service guaranteed for a signal to which the packet<br>
associated with the processing indication belongs;<br>
2)	priority guaranteed for forwarding a signal to which the packet associated<br>
with the processing indication belongs;<br>
3)	delay characteristics of a signal to which the packet associated with the<br>
processing indication belongs;<br>
4) committed information rate ("CIR") for a signal to which the packet<br>
associated with the processing indication belongs,-<br>
5)	loss of information allowed for a signal to which the packet associated<br>
with the processing indication belongs; and<br>
6)	degradation of a signal to which the packet associated with said<br>
processing indication belongs, that has already been accumulated during<br>
conveying the packet.<br>
The member minimum quality of service guaranteed for the signal, may be<br>
determined in accordance with the present invention by any way known to a<br>
person skilled in the art e.g. in accordance with a service level agreement signed<br>
with the provider that conveys this signal.<br><br><br>
Similarly, the member priority guaranteed for the signal may also be determined<br>
in accordance with the present invention by any way known to a person skilled in<br>
the art. For example, if the signal is a signaling type of signal it will receive a<br>
higher priority value than a voice type of signal, which will in turn receive a<br>
higher value than a data type of signal. Optionally, or in the alternative, this<br>
priority may be determined according to the information carried by the specific<br>
packet.<br>
The member delay characteristics may comprise an absolute value associated<br>
with the maximum delay allowed for that packet. Optionally, or in the alternative,<br>
i<br>
it may comprise a relative value that takes into account that has already been<br>
accumulated during the conveying of the packet till that point. Preferably, this<br>
related value may take into account also the delay that will be added to that<br>
packet by the device receiving the packet along the path and/or the delay that<br>
will be accumulated at the next link along which the packet is about to be<br>
conveyed. Preferably, the value of the maximum delay allowed is equal to the<br>
initial delay allowed from which each device along the path subtracts the delay<br>
that the packet will be subjected to by that device and/or its uplink. Still<br>
optionally or in the alternative, this parameter may be dependent on packet<br>
delay variation (PDV) , e.g. the delay distribution between minimum delay<br>
allowed and maximum delay allowed.<br><br>
The member CIR (Committed Information Rate) is typically associated with the<br>
bandwidth to which the service provider is committed to provide for the<br>
conveying of the signal (stream of packets) to which the packet belongs .<br><br><br>
The member "loss of information allowed" may be associated with overall signal<br>
considerations such as	<br><br>
packet discarding ratio allowed, and/or with the level of packet compression<br>
allowed, where the latter is associated a value regarding whether the packet can<br>
be compressed (Y/N), or alternatively, with the value of the maximum allowed<br>
compression level for that packet. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the<br>
art, this parameter may be further associated with any other mechanisms used<br>
which result in losing some of the information contained in the signal or in<br>
certain packets thereof. When the level of packet compression allowed is taken<br>
into effect, the value of this parameter may take into account also the<br>
impairments accumulated along the path traversed up to the device receiving the<br>
packet. Preferably, the maximum compression level allowed is equal to the<br>
compression level allowed modified by each device along the path, based on the<br>
impairments that have already been accumulated.<br>
As previously explained, the processing indication provided to the various<br>
packets may depend on one or more of these parameters.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, each processing<br>
indication value is translated for each device that is about process the packed,<br>
into a certain value for each of the parameters selected.<br>
Preferably, when the parameters used to determine the processing indication<br>
value of a packet comprise parameters that depend on the conveyance of the<br>
packet along the packet switched communication network, such as the maximum<br>
delay allowed (modified in accordance with the delay already accumulated), the<br>
compression allowed (modified by the impairments which were already<br>
accumulated by the packet) , etc., an updated processing indication is used to<br>
replace the processing indication with which that packet arrived at a certain<br>
device. The	..<br><br><br>
packet will be received at the processing point, the values of the various<br>
parameters will be derived from the processing indication, and an updated<br>
processing indication will be provided to that packet (if required) before<br>
conveying it towards the receiving end thereof.<br>
The term "algorithm" as will be used hereinafter, refers to various ways of<br>
managing the arriving signals. Such algorithms, typically operative as queue<br>
managers, and/or traffic shapers, and/or encoders and/or decoders, encompass<br>
signal relaying such as demodulation/remodulation relay or DTMF relay, native<br>
data transmission, various types of lossy or lossless compression, variable rate<br>
compression, transcoding, silence elimination, non-compressible clear channel<br>
(64 kbit/s), RTP encoder, FEC encoder, T.38 encoder, weighted fair queuing,<br>
early discarding schemes and the like. The term "rate adjusting mechanism" as<br>
used herein, refers to a mechanism to select an algorithm rate by which to<br>
adjust the bandwidth required for the signal operated on, and/or its queuing<br>
and/or its transmission.<br>
As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, the method provided by the<br>
present invention allows differentiated handling of a packet at each of the<br>
devices located along the path of conveying the packet. This differentiation is<br>
derived from various processing indications that may be provided to a single<br>
packet along its path as explained above, and/or from various available<br>
resources at the various processing points along that path. In such a case, it<br>
could well be that some of the packets be processed at a certain location in<br>
accordance with one algorithm at a certain rate and quality, while other packets,<br>
provided with the very same processing indication and even the same type of<br>
signals, be processed by a different algorithm (preferably,	<br><br>
as long as there is no breach of the parameters defined by that processing<br>
indication) and be forwarded at a different quality and rate.<br>
According to another embodiment of the present invention, the rate adjusting<br>
mechanism is dependent on the type of the transmitted signal. In other words,<br>
different mechanisms and/or processing methods may be applied for example on<br>
a multimedia or voice type of signal as opposed to a facsimile signal.<br>
As can be appreciated by those skilled in the art, the method described<br>
hereinabove could be applied not only on signals received in their non-<br>
compressed form, but also on signals received in their already compressed (e.g.<br>
encoded) form, in which case the signals may either be left in their compressed<br>
mode, or be further compressed or transcoded, if so required. Naturally, if the<br>
bandwidth available is more than the bandwidth required, a decision may be<br>
taken to improve the signal quality by adding protection (adding redundant<br>
information to ensure better quality transmission of the signal) or to decompress<br>
(or at least partially decompress) such compressed signals. Preferably, the rate<br>
adjusting mechanism comprises replacing of at least one processing method<br>
associated with at least one active channel with another appropriate processing<br>
method, in accordance with a pre-defined scheme associated with such at least<br>
one processing method. Also, as would be appreciated by those skilled in the art,<br>
replacing of an processing method with another appropriate processing method,<br>
encompasses using the same algorithm but at different rates.<br><br>
According to still another embodiment of the present invention, the processing<br>
point is an apparatus being a	<br><br>
member selected from the group consisting of: a bearer, a switch, a router,<br>
border gateway and a media gateway.<br>
By yet another embodiment of the invention, the rate adjusting mechanism<br>
comprises applying a processing method on a packet received, which processing<br>
method is a member selected from the group consisting of: PCM, ADPCM, CS-<br>
ACELP, LD-CELP, MPNLQ, ACELP, AMR, EVRC, SMV, QCELP, VBD Relay, FEC/no<br>
FEC, RTP encoder/decoder, T.38 encoder/decoder, MPEGI, MPEG2, MPEG4,<br>
MPEG3, H.264, and the like.<br>
According to another aspect of the invention there is provided a packet<br>
forwarding device which comprises : an input interface adapted to receives a<br>
packet that is to be forwarded in a packet switched network; a processor coupled<br>
with said input interface and adapted to analyze a first processing indication<br>
associated with the packet, if such a processing indication exist, and to operate<br>
on the packet according to processing instructions retrieved from that first<br>
processing indication, and wherein the processor is further adapted to associate<br>
the packet with a second processing indication determined in accordance with<br>
the payload of the packet and/or of its. neighboring packets; and a conveying<br>
means adapted to forward the packet towards its respective destination in<br>
accordance with the processing instructions associated with the second<br>
processing indication.<br>
By another embodiment of the invention, the first processing indication and the<br>
second processing indication are essentially identical processing indications.<br>
By yet another embodiment of the invention, at least one of the first and second<br>
processing indications	<br><br>
relates to a part of the packet with which that at least one indication is<br>
associated. In addition or in the alternative, at least one of the first and second<br>
processing indications relates to processing both the whole packet and part of<br>
the packet, while the appropriate processing is applied under the corresponding<br>
network conditions.<br>
In accordance with still another embodiment of the invention, there is provided a<br>
packet forwarding device which comprises:<br>
•	an input interface adapted to receive a first plurality of packets from one or<br>
more upstream nodes, wherein said first plurality of packets is associated<br>
with a single communication signal and comprises at least a second plurality<br>
of packets, where each of said second plurality of packets is associated with a<br>
processing indication, and wherein the processing indications associated with<br>
said second plurality of packets comprise at least two different processing<br>
indications;<br>
•	a processor coupled with said input interface to associate each of said second<br>
plurality of packets with one or more processing parameters having a value<br>
that corresponds to the processing indication associated with the individual<br>
packet;<br>
•	a scheduler responsive to said processor to order said second plurality of<br>
packets for conveying said second plurality of packets towards their<br>
destination under the conditions that correspond to said one or more<br>
processing parameters; and<br>
•	a conveying means adapted to forward said first plurality of packets towards<br>
their respective destination.<br><br>
According to an embodiment of the invention the packet forwarding device further<br>
comprises at least one processor capable of checking quality of packets received, and/or<br>
checking priority associated with each of the packets received, and/or checking a delay<br>
associated with a packet received and a maximum delay allowed for that packet, and/or<br>
checking a committed information rate associated with a packet received.<br>
According to another embodiment of the invention, the packet forwarding device further<br>
comprises at least one encoder/decoder adapted to compress packets received in<br>
accordance with the type of the signals to which these packets belong.<br>
By another embodiment of the invention there is also provided a buffer at at least one<br>
apparatus located along the transmission path, operative to store received packets (or<br>
their parts) . This buffer is operative in accordance with the conditions retrieved from<br>
the various processing indications of the stored packet (s) in order to meet the<br>
operating instructions set by the parameters as defined by the respective packet<br>
indication(s). Preferably, after processing the processing indications, the parameters,<br>
relating to each or to certain indications, are being updated (if necessary) , and the<br>
updated indications are associated with the respective packets before the packets are<br>
further conveyed.<br>
According to still another embodiment of the invention, the buffer is further adapted to<br>
carry out any one or more of the following: rearranging the packets in the appropriate<br>
order e.g. based on the packets' sequence number, reducing the packet's delay variation<br>
(PDV), reshaping the packets delay distribution and the like.<br>
By yet another embodiment of the invention, if the apparatus is located as an edge<br>
device, e.g. at the Rx	<br><br>
side, the buffer further allows establishing the de- jittering required to re-order<br>
the packets and reduce their delay variation in the system, by determining the<br>
required delay to be set at the buffer so as to minimize the packets delay<br>
variation while optimizing the ratio between the overall delay and the number of<br>
packets lost.<br>
In addition, the packets' processing indications of the present invention further<br>
comprise information about changes that occurred to the respective packets<br>
along their path of transmission. When packets carrying processing indications<br>
that comprise such information are received at the appropriate apparatus, e.g. at<br>
the Rx side, the packets may be restored (to whatever extent possible) in order<br>
to minimize the impact of these changes on the signal that will eventually be<br>
received by the user.<br>
According to yet another embodiment, the Tx side transmitting the packets is<br>
provided with information regarding the capabilities of the receiving end, the Rx,<br>
for the signal to be transmitted. In such a case, certain changes may be effected<br>
already a the Tx side, e.g. discarding packets (or parts thereof) , compressing<br>
packets, etc. and based on the information provided to the Rx by the packets'<br>
processing indications (which comprise for example information about the overall<br>
signal considerations parameter) , the signal may be restored in a way that<br>
conceals the impact of these changes.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
The present invention will be understood and appreciated more fully from the<br>
following detailed examples taken in conjunction with the drawing:<br><br>
FIG. 1 illustrates a schematic representation of a traffic-handling device<br>
constructed and operative in accordance with an embodiment of the present<br>
invention.<br>
FIG. 2 illustrates a schematic detailed representation of the local degradation<br>
assessment device comprised in the traffic-handling device of Fig. 1.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
In the modern communication traffic network, a large number of communication<br>
channels may simultaneously occupy the full bandwidth available. Examples of<br>
such applications may be found in concurrent transmissions of voice channel (s)<br>
with or without compression, fax(s), data or any combination thereof, and both<br>
in TDM and packetized networks.<br>
As was previously explained, one of the problems that has been associated with<br>
forwarding the traffic along packetized networks is the processing of the various<br>
packets, in a way to ensure minimization of the signal's degradation at the<br>
receiving end. In order to meet this challenge, the present invention provides a<br>
method and device for forwarding packets in such packetized networks.<br>
When a signal is forwarded along a path in a packet switched communication<br>
network, sometimes it will be required to ensure a pre-determined quality at<br>
which the signal will be received at its destination. This predetermination can<br>
result from any number of reasons. For example, guaranteed quality for traffic<br>
delivered by a service provider in accordance with an SLA, minimum quality<br>
required for that type of signal to allow its reception at the receiving end at a still<br>
reasonable quality, etc.<br><br>
The solution provided by the present invention is to associate at least some, or<br>
preferably all, of the packets that together comprise the forwarded signal, with<br>
an indication that includes "instructions" how to process the packet (or a part of<br>
the packet) that each indication is associated with. As will be appreciated by<br>
those skilled in the art, a further improvement may be achieved if only part of<br>
the packets are provided with such indications, while the other can be processed<br>
either in accordance with pre-defined processing instructions. In addition or in<br>
the alternative, packets that are not provided with such an indication may be<br>
processed in accordance with the latest indication received which was associated<br>
with a packet that belongs to the same signal that the now-to-be processed<br>
packets which do not carry such indication, belong. This way, the indication is<br>
associated with a packet only when a change in the processing instructions is to<br>
be effected.<br>
By way of example, the indication is constructed at each processing point from a<br>
look-up table provided thereat in the following way. A number of parameters<br>
that will have an effect on the way the various packets will be processed, are<br>
selected. Such parameters may either one of the following: the minimum quality<br>
of service guaranteed for the signal; a priority guaranteed for the signal; delay<br>
characteristics; committed information rate ("CIR") ; and loss of information<br>
allowed, or any combination thereof. Different values are assigned for each of<br>
the selected parameters, and each combination that is comprised of certain value<br>
per selected parameter, is associated with a single value of the indication. Let us<br>
consider a simple example where the parameters selected are minimum quality<br>
guaranteed, the priority and the delay. One may divide for the sake of<br><br><br>
simplicity each of these parameters into three levels (e.g. high, medium, low, or<br>
1, 2 and 3, etc.) . Thus, there would be 9 indication values, each describing a<br>
different combination of all three parameters. The value of this indication, which<br>
is expressed in at least one bit, and is preferably carried within the packet, e.g.<br>
as part of the packet's header, allows a proper processing of the packet at the<br>
next processing node.<br><br>
Let us now consider few examples to demonstrate the use of the above table. A<br>
packet that carries an active speech signal, may be provided with the indication<br>
"0010", meaning that the maximum delay allowed is 60 msec, the relevant<br>
discarding policy for this packet is 3 (where the value "4" indicates a policy<br>
whereby the packet may be relatively easily discarded while the value "1"<br>
indicates a packet that should not be easily discarded) , and the maximum<br>
compression allowed is by the CS-ACELP algorithm (i.e. to about 8 Kbit/s). For a<br>
packet that comprises silence, the indication 0011 may be used, which uses<br>
basically the same parameters as those associated with the previously described<br>
indication, with the exception that this packet can more easily be	<br><br>
discarded than the packet that carries active speech signal.<br>
Assuming that the signal is a fax signal, in which case a packet carrying T.30<br>
commands (DIS, DCS etc.) may be associated with the indication "0000" while a<br>
packet carrying fax images (i.e. fax pages) may be associated with the indication<br>
"0001" . That means that the packet carrying the T.30 commands using a 300<br>
bps V.21 modulation scheme, may be compressed into less bandwidth than a<br>
packet carrying fax image, using 9600 bps v.29 modulation scheme (to 32 Kbit<br>
compared with 40 Kbit for the latter), but will be less subjected to discarding<br>
than the fax image carrying packet, due to the typical sensitivity of fax machines<br>
to loss of commands. As previously explained, typically, there will be two or more<br>
different indications associated with different packets, even if the packets belong<br>
to the same signal. For example, parameters like minimum quality guaranteed,<br>
priority, etc. are usually determined per customer and are likely to be the same<br>
for all packets belonging to the signal being forwarded. On the other hand, the<br>
delay accumulated may vary from packet to packet, e.g. depending on the path<br>
along which that specific packet was forwarded, queues on the way, etc.<br>
Consequently, there could be cases where even two consecutive packets will<br>
each be associated with a different processing indication, and be processed<br>
differently, to allow the end result, i.e. the signal received at the receiving end of<br>
the path, to be the best possible under the network resources.<br>
In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, the processing<br>
indication to be associated with a certain packet is determined based on the<br>
payload carried by the packet and/or by its neighboring packets.<br><br>
Let us now consider the following example. Suppose that the signal carried by a<br>
number of packets is a constant tone signal, which means that the payloads<br>
carried by the packets relate to parts of the signal, each having essentially the<br>
same characteristics as that carried by other packets (e.g. intensity, spectrum<br>
etc.). In such a case, if some of the intermediate packets are lost, a concealment<br>
of the signal can be made, by using the information carried by their neighboring<br>
packets. Therefore, the indication that will be carried by the intermediate packets<br>
may be such that allows higher discarding probability than other packets which<br>
carry payload that is substantially different from the payload carried by their<br>
neighboring packets.<br>
A process of determining values of certain parameters, ones that may be varied<br>
along the forwarding path, is exemplified in the following example.<br>
Fig. 1 illustrates a schematic representation of a traffic-handling device 10<br>
constructed and operative in accordance with an embodiment of the present<br>
invention.<br>
Once a packet arrives at traffic-handling device 10, the signal carried by the<br>
packet is classified by signal classifier 100 to establish its type, e.g. a voice<br>
signal, a facsimile signal, a modem signal, a data signal, a DTMF signal, video<br>
signal, etc. The indication associated with the packet is analyzed by indication<br>
analyzer 204, and the processing instructions provided through the use of that<br>
indication, are retrieved. The signal carried by the packet is also forwarded to<br>
local degradation assessment 102, which operation will be further explained in<br>
connection with Fig. 2. The decision made at local degradation device 102 is<br>
forwarded to global degradation device 104 together with information retrieved<br>
from the packet's indication by indication	<br><br>
analyzer 204 that relates to the already accumulated degradation.<br>
Information that relates to the delay accumulated by the packet and retrieved<br>
from its indication is forwarded by indication analyzer 204 to global delay<br>
assessment device 106, and based on that information a global delay assessment<br>
is made. The global delay assessment together with the global degradation<br>
assessment made by device 104, and other parameters that relate to the packet<br>
indication such as minimum quality required, priority guaranteed and committed<br>
information rate, are all forwarded to controller 201.<br>
Based on all the information receives, controller 201 provides processing end<br>
queuing instructions to unit 108 in order to have the packet processed (e.g.<br>
through the use of the appropriate encoder) and buffered in a way that satisfy<br>
(to the extent possible) all the processing instructions derived from the packet's<br>
indication under the system available resources. Once the packet is ready to be<br>
forwarded towards its next station, processor 110 will associate an appropriate<br>
updated indication (if necessary) with the packet while replacing the previous<br>
indication with which the packet arrived at device 10, and the packet will then be<br>
forwarded.<br>
Let us revert now to Fig. 2 which illustrates the operation of local degradation<br>
assessment device 102, according to this example. The arriving packet is<br>
forwarded to multiple algorithm/rate encoders of device 102 that conforms to the<br>
signal's type and the processing instructions provided by the packet's indication.<br>
The packet is then replicated at a number of encoders 203', 203", 203"', and<br>
preferably a near zero bit encoder (frame discarding device 203"" and/or silence<br>
suppressor 203'""), each adapted to operate on that packet at a	<br><br>
transmission method different than the others. Each of these encoders' outputs<br>
is forwarded through the corresponding decoders (206', 206", 206'", 206"",<br>
206'"") and then to the appropriate comparator (208', 208", 208", 208"", 208 "')<br>
where each of the differently processed copy of the signal is compared with the<br>
original signal received, and the degradation of the signal as encoded by each of<br>
the encoders, is estimated. These estimations are then forwarded to a decision-<br>
making processor 210 together with the processing instructions, where a matrix<br>
matching the quality estimation with the transmission method, can be prepared.<br>
In addition, the transmission method could be evaluated by the decision making<br>
processor and/or the various comparators, to determine its effect on the quality<br>
of the related signal.<br>
The data received is collected and processed, and a quality function, which may<br>
depend upon one or more of the above-mentioned parameters, is established.<br>
Preferably, this function is a multi-dimensional function (e.g. a three dimensional<br>
function), which matches a quality value for each pair of a transmission method<br>
and a delay parameter, under constrain(s) presented by the processing<br>
instructions. In other words, an array is formed wherein for each given pair of<br>
transmission method (typically, the rate values are taken as those of the various<br>
203 encoders) and delay values, there is a matching quality value that<br>
represents the quality of the packet that was processed at the corresponding<br>
rate and by the corresponding algorithm.<br>
The local degradation assessment based on the quality estimation is then made<br>
and can be forwarded to global degradation assessment device 104 which<br>
receives	.<br><br>
also the input regarding the already accumulated degradation.<br>
