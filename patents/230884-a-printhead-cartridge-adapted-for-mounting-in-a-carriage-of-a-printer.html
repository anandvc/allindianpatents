1. Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a printhead cartridge for a printer. In particular, the present invention discloses a printhead cartridge with asymmetrical contacts that enables a size- reduction in a corresponding flexible ci-rcuit board (FOB)- within the printer.<br>
2. Description of the Prior Art<br>
Please refer to Fig.l. Fig.l is a perspective view of a  prior  art  printhead  cartridge  10.  The  prior  art printhead cartridge 10 comprises an inkwell 12 and a tape automated bonding  (TAB)  structure  14.  The TAB 14  is mounted on the inkwell 12, wrapping around from a front surface 15 to a bottom surface 19. The TAB 14 comprises a plurality of contacts- 16, each with a 'corresponding trace 17 that electrically connects to a printhead 18.  The printhead 18 is mounted on the TAB 14, and is disposed on the bottom .surface 19 of the inkwell 12. The printhead cartridge  10  exhibits  great  symmetry  along  a  cross-section A-A. .If the printhead cartridge 10 were to be split down the middle along the line A-A,  each half . of the printhead cartridge 10 would -have approximately the same number of contacts 16 (depending upon the parity of the number of contacts 16), and half of the printhead 18. The inkwell- 12 is used to hold ink (not shown) , and to provide this ink to the printhead 18. The printhead 18 performs a printing operation by jetting ink' according to<br>
signals received from the contacts 16.<br>
Please refer to Fig.2 with reference to Fig.l. Fig. 2<br>
is a perspective view of a prior art printer 20.  The<br>
printhead cartridge 10 is adapted for use in the printer<br>
20. The printer 20 has a carriage 22 that holds two of<br>
the  printhead  cartridges  10,  carrying  the  printhead<br>
cartridges 10 back and forth along a print track 24. The<br>
two printhead cartridges 10 are held as closely together<br>
as possible- within the carriage 22. With each pass along<br>
the track 24, -the printhead cartridges 10 form a print<br>
swath on a sheet of paper 21. Generally speaking, one of<br>
the printhead cartridges 10 performs a black-and-white<br>
printing operation, whereas the other printhead cartridge<br>
10  performs  a  color  printing  operation  using  cyan,<br>
magenta and yellow inks.  Together,  the  two printhead<br>
cartridges 10 are able to perform a full-color printing<br>
process upon the' sheet of paper 21.<br>
Please refer to Fig.3 with reference to Figs.1 and 2.<br>
Fig. 3 is a schematic diagram of a flexible circuit board<br>
(FCB) 30 within the printer 20. The FCB 30 is disposed<br>
within  the  carriage  22  and  is  used  to  establish<br>
electrical communications with the printhead cartridges<br>
10. 'The FCB 30 has a plurality -of dimples 36,  each of<br>
which establishes an electrical connection with one of<br>
.the corresponding contacts 16 of the printhead cartridges<br>
10. In this manner, the printer 20 is able to control the<br>
printhead 18 of each printhead cartridge .10.<br>
The cost -associated with the FCB 30 is related to the overall surface area of the FCB 30. By reducing the size of the FCB 30, it should be possible to reduce the total cost of the printer 10.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is therefore a primary objective of this invention, to  provide  a printhead  cartridge with  an  asymmetric distribution  of  -contacts  to  reduce  a  size  of  a corresponding contact surface within a printer.<br>
Briefly summarized, the preferred embodiment of the present invention discloses a printhead. cartridge that mounts within a carriage of a printer. The. carriage moves along a first direction within the printer. The printhead cartridge includes an inkwell for storing ink, which has a front surface and a bottom surface, a printhead mounted on the bottom surface, and a plurality of contacts for receiving signals from the printer and' to' provide the signals to the printhead. A centerline of the front surface, running perpendicular to the first direction, evenly defines first and second sides of the front<br>
surface. The contacts are disposed on the front surface,<br>
and a distribution of the contacts on the first side<br>
exceeds a corresponding distribution of the contacts on the second side.<br>
It is an advantage of the present invention that by providing an asymmetric distribution of the- contacts of the front surface of a printhead cartridge, two such mirrored cartridges will form a combined density of contacts that is higher towards their combined center position. The traces on, a contact surface within the carriage of the printer can 'be made to run between two columns of dimples. The size of the corresponding contact surface can be reduced as a result of this, which leads to a total lower cost of the printer-.<br>
These and other objectives of the present invention will no doubt "become obvious to those of ordinary skill in the art after reading the following detailed description of the' preferred embodiment, which is illustrated in the various figures and drawings.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
Please'refer to Fig.4. Fig.4 is -a perspective view of a preferred embodiment printhead cartridge 40a according<br>
to the present invention. The printhead cartridge 40a comprises an inkwell 42, and a tape automated bonding (TAB) structure 44 mounted on the inkwell 42. The inkwell 42 has a front surface 45 and a bottom surface 49. The TAB 44 is mounted on the front surface 45, and wraps around to the bottom surface 49. The TAB 44 includes a plurality of contacts 46a, each in electrical connection with a printhead 48 by way of a trace 47. All of the contacts 46a are on the front surface 45 of the inkwell 42, whereas the printhead 48 is disposed on the bottom surface 49. The contacts 46a are arranged in a plurality of columns 46c. The inkwell 42 provides ink' (not shown) to the printhead 48. The printhead 48 - jets the ink according to signals received from the contacts 46a.<br>
Please refer to Fig. 5.with reference to Fig.4. Fig. 5 is a perspective view of a printer 50 according to the present invention. The printhead cartridge 40a is adapted for use within the printer 50. The printer 50 includes a carriage 52 that holds 'the printhead cartridge 40a, and carries the printhead cartridge 40a back and forth along a direction X of a print track 54. With each pass along the print track 54, the printhead cartridge 40a jets ink onto a document 51 to perform a printing operation. The printhead cartridge 40a is mounted in an upright manner within the  carriage 52,  the bottom surface  49  facing downwards, so that gravity may help to feed ink to the printhead  48.   The  printhead  cartridge  40a  has  a centerline along a direction Y-Y, which 'evenly defines a first side 45R and a second side 45L of the front surface 45.  This  centerline  Y-Y,  a  vertical  bisector,  is perpendicular to the direction X of the print track 54. The first side 45R has about half of. the total -surface area of the front surface 45, with the second side 45L<br>
having the remainder. A majority of the contacts 46a are<br>
disposed on the first side 45R, so that the distribution<br>
of contacts 46a on the first side 45R exceeds that of the<br>
second side 45L. That is, the number of contact columns<br>
46c on the first side 45R is different from the number of<br>
contact  columns  46c  on  the  second  side  45L.  The<br>
distribution of contacts 46a is thus asymmetric with<br>
respect   to   the   centerline   Y-Y.   This   asymmetric<br>
distribution  is  in  excess  of  any  simple  disparities<br>
brought about by parity (i.e., an odd number of contacts<br>
46a) . The first side 45R should have at least 5 percent<br>
more contacts 46a than the .second side 45L. The bottom<br>
surface.49 also has a centerline B-B, which substantially<br>
evenly divides the bottom surface  49.  Note that the<br>
centerline B-B aligns with the centerline Y-Y, so that if<br>
one were to evenly split the printhead cartridge 40a in<br>
half, one would have to cut along both the centerline Y-Y<br>
and the centerline B-B.  The printhead 48  lies evenly<br>
disposed along the centerline B-B.<br>
The printhead cartridge 40a is preferably designed to work  in  conjunction  with  a  complementary  printhead cartridge 40b. For example, the printhead cartridge 40a may  hold  only  colored  ink,  whereas  the  printhead cartridge 40b will.hold black ink. Please refer to Fig. 6 with reference to Figs. 4 and 5. Fig. 6 is a perspective' view of the printhead cartridges 40a and 40b according to the  present  invention,  which  are  to  be  used  in  the printer  50.  The  printhead  cartridge  40b  also  has  an asymmetrical distribution of contacts 4 6b in accordance with the present invention, with a higher distribution of contacts 4 6b being towards the printhead cartridge 40a. The printhead cartridge  40b may be  thought  of as  a reflection along a line R-R of the printhead cartridge<br>
40a, as regards the distribution of the contacts 46b with respect to that of the contacts 46a. Of course, the printhead cartridge 40b may have a fewer or greater number of contacts 4 6b than contacts 46a. The key point is, however, that a greater number of contacts 46a and 4 6b are moved closer towards the imaginary line R-R between the printhead cartridges 40a and 40b. By placing a greater percentage of the contacts 46a and 4 6b closer together, a size reduction can be made on a corresponding flexible circuit board (FCB) within the carriage 52.<br>
Please refer to Fig.7 with reference to Figs.4, 5 and 6.  Fig.7 is a schematic diagram -of a flexible circuit board  (FCB)  70 disposed within the carriage 52 of the printer 50. The FCB 70 is used as a contact surface to establish electrical connections with each contact 46a and  46b  of  the  printhead  cartridges  40a  and  40b, respectively. The FCB 70 has a plurality of dimples 76a, each of which establishes an electrical connection with one corresponding contact 46a, and a plurality of dimples 76b,  each of which establishes an electrical connection with one corresponding contact 46b. In this manner, by way of the FCB 70, the printer 50 is capable of sending signals to the printhead cartridges 40a and 40b.  The complementary asymmetric distributions  of the  contacts 46a and 46b on their respective printhead cartridges 40a and 40b leads to a greater concentration of corresponding dimples -76a and 76b towards a center 75c of the. FCB 70, This, in turn, leads to a corresponding decrease in the number of dimples 76a and 76b on the sides 75L and 75R of the FCB 70. A consequence of this is that traces 77 from the dimples 76a and 76b are more concentrated in -the center 75c of the FCB .70,  and fewer traces 77 need be made that run along the sides 75L and 75R of the FCB 70.<br>
The traces 77 may also be made to run between two columns of dimples, such as between columns 79a and 79b. The sides 75R and 75L may thus be pulled in towards the center 75c, which leads to a size reduction of the FCB 70. As an extreme example of this, if all of the contacts 4 6a of the printhead cartridge 40a were placed upon the . side 45R, the traces 77a, 77b, 77c and 77d would clearly move closer towards the center 75c of the FCB 70. The<br>
region thus  currently occupied by the traces  77a-77d<br>
\ could thus be trimmed away from the FCB 70, -leading to a<br>
further reduction in size of the FCB 70.<br>
Several  methods  may  be  utilized  to  create  an asymmetric  distribution  of  contacts  on  a  printhead cartridge so as to enjoy the corresponding result in a size reduction of the contact surface (i.e., the FCB 70) within the printer. The preferred embodiment is depicted in Fig. 4,  in which the centerline B-B of the TAB 44 aligns with ' the centerline Y-Y of the front ' surf ace 45. In this case, more contacts 46a are concentrated on one side of the centerline Y-Y than on the other, leading to the   asymmetric   distribution   of    contacts    46a. Alternatively, however, the TAB 44 itself may be moved to be asymmetric with respect to the centerline Y-Y. Please refer to Fig-. 8.  Fig. 8 is a second embodiment 80 of a printhead cartridge according to ,the present invention. The printhead cartridge 80 includes an inkwell 82 and a TAB 84-.  The inkwell 82 has a front surface 85 and . a bottom surface 89. The front surface 85 is evenly defined by a centerline C-C into a first side 85R and a second side  85L.  The bottom surface 89  is  similarly evenly divided by  a  centerline  E-E,  which  aligns  with  the centerline C-C. The TAB 84 is disposed on both the front surface  85  and bottom surface  89 of the inkwell  82,<br>
having a plurality of contacts 86 disposed on the front surface 85, and a printhead 88 on the bottom surface 89. The portion of the TAB 84 mounted on the front surface 85 is  evenly  divided by  a  centerline  D-D,  whereas  the portion of the TAB 84 mounted _on the bottom surface 89 is evenly divided by a centerline F-F. The centerline D-D aligns with the centerline F-F to evenly divide the entire TAB 84. The contacts 86 are symmetrically disposed around the TAB  84  centerline  D-D so 'that,  excepting parity considerations, an equal number of contacts 86 are on one side of the centerline D-D as on the other side of the centerline D-D. However, the centerline D-D of the TAB 84 is offset from the centerline C-C of the front surface 85. This causes more contacts 86 to be disposed within  the  side  85R,  which  leads  to  an  asymmetric distribution of the contacts 86 on the front surface 85 with respect to the centerline C-C. On the bottom surface 89,  the printhead 88 is mounted in alignment with the centerline E-E of the bottom surface 89, rather than the centerline  F-F  of  the  TAB  84.  In  this  manner,  the printhead  88 remains  centrally aligned on the bottom surface  89,  which is preferred as only one  type  of inkwell 82 must thus be fashioned.<br>
A printhead centrally aligned on the bottom surface of the inkwell is not a prereguisite, however, of the present invention. Please refer to Fig.9. Fig.9 is a third embodiment 90 of a present invention printhead cartridge. In this embodiment, as in the previous embodiment 80, centerlines H-H and J-J of the • TAB 94 are offset from the corresponding centerlines G-G and I-I of the inkwell 92. However, the printhead 98 is aligned with the TAB 94 centerline J-J of the bottom surface 99. Consequently, both the contacts 96 and the printhead 98<br>
are symmetric with respect to the TAB 94, but are asymmetric with respect to the inkwell 92. This design is considered somewhat inferior, though, as it requires two different types of inkwell 92: one that supports a greater distribution of contacts 96 on the side 95R, and another that supports a greater distribution of contacts 96 on the'side 95L.<br>
In contrast to the prior art, the present invention provides an asymmetric distribution of contacts on the front surface of an inkwell. By pairing two such pr_inthead cartridges together, each with opposing symmetries of contacts, a greater number of contacts may be brought closer together in the pairing of the printhead cartridges. For a contact surface within the printer that is used to establish communications with the paired printhead cartridges (i.e., an FCB), a higher density of corresponding dimples are brought towards the center of this connecting surface. The outer edges of the surface may thus be trimmed away, leading to a size reduction of the surface, and consequently, reduced costs associated with the printer.<br>
Those skilled in the art will readily observe that 'numerous modifications and alterations of the device may be made while retaining the teachings of the invention. For example, it may be possible to trim at least one corner of the TAB, or make the TAB into a wavy shape. Accordingly, the above disclosure should be construed as limited only by the metes and bounds of the appended claims.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
