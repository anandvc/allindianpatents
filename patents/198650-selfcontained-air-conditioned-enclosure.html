				<td>BACKGROUND-FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This Invention relatses to a portable, and comfortable Air Conditioning unit; specifically to an self contained conditioned enclosure to provide an air-conditioned assembly for indoor or outdoor use that is compact and portable.<br>
BACKGROUND-DESCRIPTION OF PRIOR ART<br>
Air-conditioning of space with units employing refrigerants are used for cooling space for personal comfort. Commercial air conditioners employing refrigerants have the following disadvantages:<br>
(a)	Higher Capita! investment in tfie space to be air-conditioned : For<br>
effective and efficient use of Air Conditioning requires a room or a building to be built with thermal insulation, air infiltration seals, shaded windows and other special requirements. Such special requirements result in higher capital investment in addition to the cost of the air conditioner<br>
(b)	Higher  Capital investment  for  larger  air-condition   unit  :   The<br>
minimum space that could be effectively air-conditioned using the traditional air condition unit is an entire room, even if conditioning Is required only for a portion of the room that is occupied. Commercial portable air conditioners have the same limitation. The larger the space to be air-conditioned the larger is the<br><br>
f<br>
air condition unit required. Larger the unit higher the cost For example in a bedroom the minimum space that requires air-conditioning is the compact space surrouunding the body of the occupants. In current application the entire bedroom needs to be air-conditioned. This will result in unnecessary extra cost of larger equipment and installation,<br>
(c)	Higher Operation cost: As discussed in previous paragraphs traditionai<br>
units would be of larger capacity than the minimum needed for specific application. Larger the unit higher is the operating cost for electric energy. Cooling of a selective smaller space offers comfort at a lower operational cost A selected enclosure could be cooled with commercially available portable air conditioner however the disadvantage is the portable air conditioner can not supply cooled fresh air but only re-circulates the space air.<br>
(d)	Enclosures available for clean air requirements such as Michael H. PelosI,<br>
III et al U.S. Pat No. 5314377 Is not suitable for comfort Air Conditioning of a<br>
compact space, as it requires an independent source of conditioned air In the<br>
place of the clean air source. Also the prior art enclosure has cumbersonne<br>
structure requiring complex assembly. The objective of this enclosure is to<br>
provide clean air and not comfort conditioning, so major modification Is<br>
necessary before It can be used for comfort air condition application.<br><br>
Commercially available portable air conditioner can cool an enclosed space however the disadvantage Is it cannot supply cooled fresh air but can only recirculates the space air Thus none of the current apparatuses are suitable for providing an air-conditioned enclosure.<br>
Air Conditioned Mosquito net of patents such as San Jianhua et al China. Pat No. CN2259099 and Tan Mingsen et al China. Pat No. CN1163735, illustrates mosquito nets connected to a conditioned air source by an air duct Both of these prior art requires an external source of conditioned ain Also In both of these prior arts, outside air is conditioned and supplied to the enclosure and all of the air is exhausted outside the enclosure.  Heat Insulating Mosquito-Net' of He Baoan et al China. Pat No. CN1061140, illustrates a mosquito-net with plurality of inflatable air-pocket walls. This air has the disadvantage of requiring inflation and increases the chance of failure of thermal insulation due to puncturing of the Inflated air pockets.<br>
Portable isolation device and method of US patent no. 6162118 relates to an isolation device with an air conducting unit for conditioning air and the method of isolating a patient positioned in a partially enclosed space. The most distinguishing features of the present invention Is to construct a Enclosure assembly which is self contained, easy assembled structure with air conditioning unit to provide comfort air conditioned for the enclosed space. Portable inflatable enclosure system with filtered positive pressure gas fed therein of US<br><br>
patent no. 5832919 is for method of providing portable enclosure system wherein the air conditioning for the enclosed space is explained mainly on filtering of air by rriajntalning positive pressune within the chamber without the details of connecting the enclosure system to the air conditioning unit<br>
Thus the present Invention relates to a portable temperature control enclosure assembly with new and novel constructional features aiongwith unique operational feature, unknown to prior art<br>
SUMMARY<br>
In accordance with the principles of the present invention there is an air-conditioned Enclosure assembly comprising of a portable Air Conditioning Unit and a connected Enclosure to provide an air-conditioned enclosed space with fresh air supply, that is self contained, portable and modular and thereby providing a comfortable personal environnnent for occupants inside.<br>
OBJECTS AND ADVANTAGES<br>

to provide energy conservation through re-circufating a part of the enclosure air;<br>
to provide cooled or heated fresh air to offer better air quality for the occupants;<br>
to provide energy conservation by pre-cooling the fresh inlet air with the cool exhaust air. The same applies for heating too; to  provide control over the quantity of fresh air using air damper;<br>
to improve the efficiency of the system by using the exhaust air for the condenser coil cooling;<br>
to provide an air-conditioned personal space for both indoor and outdoors use;<br><br>
(j)	to provide reduced Initial cooling time from the start of cooling<br>
to achieve the comfort temperature. The same applies for heating too;<br>
(k)	to  provide comfort air-conditioning without requiring  special<br>
building construction requirennents such as themnai insulation, air Infiltration seals^ shaded windows and others;<br>
(i)	to   provide  an  Enclosure  for  quick assembly   using  widely<br>
available materials;<br>
(m)	to provide a dedicated Air Conditioning Unit to provide comfort<br>
to the enclosed space<br>
The process of air condition referred in this invention generally refers to heating or coollngy humidification or dehumidification, and filtering of air for comfort.

The enclosure is prefabricated with the wall sheets and spacer strips including a roof portion and drapes over the frame structure. One side of the wall may be provided with re-sealable opening for people passage preferably with hook a nd loop fasteners.<br>
WORKING OF THE INVENTION<br>
The working of the invention is herein desaibed in detail. The said endosure assembly 1, creates an isolated air space above an occupied surfaoe, an example of such an application is around a bed as shown in FIG1<br>
The Enclosure isolates the inside space from the outside thermally and avoids outside air infiltration. The said air opening rims 15 and 16, wrap around the said Air Ducts, and offers air passage or connection with the Air Condition Unit 17. The Endosure assembly is structured to be lightweight, to cost less, and bo offer quick and easy assembly and disassembly; thus offering pcrtabiiity.<br>
Endosure a'vr is drawn through the Exit Air opening 13 and Exit Air Duct 20. Part of the air from duct 20 and Fresh air from Fresh Air Chamber 36 Is mixed In the Air Plenum 23. The air is filtered through the Air FiIter 25 and is moved by fan 24 through the Evaporator Coil Assembly 26, where it is conditioned. The conditioned air enters the Enclosure through the Supply Air Duct 21.<br><br>
Part of the Exit air from duct 20 passes through the Heat Transfer Duct 37 to Compressor Chamber 31. The Air Damper 39 controls the flow of air Inside the Heat Transfer Duct 37. Air Damper 39 is adjusted by the Control Knob 38 interconnected by Control Rods 40 and links. The air in duct 37, pre-conditions, pre-cools or pre-heats the fresh air in the Fresh Air Chamber 36. This preconditioning of the fresh air by the exhaust air conserves energy. The Fresh Air chamber is supplied by fresh air through the Air Grills 33 located at the bottom.<br>
Outside air is also drawn Inside the compressor chamber 31, through the air grills at the lower portion of the said Chamber. Air from the Heat Transfer Duct 37, enters the said chamber 31, and mixes with air in the chamber, and is moved by the blower 27, The blower moves the air mixture across the condenser coil assembly 30, and exhausts it through the exhaust duct 28. The exhaust duct's free end may be located to exhaust hot air outside of the building through a window or doorway if the Invention Is used Indoor For outdoor use the exhaust duct can exhaust to the space.<br>
Condusions Ramifications and Scope<br>
The above description illustrating the Self-contained Air conditioned enclosure provide air-conditioned comfort with fresh air at economical capital cost, conserves energy, operates with lower cost, is portable can be assembled easily and has longer life.<br>
While the above contains many specifications these should not he construed as limitations on the scope of the scope of the invention, but rater as<br><br>
an exemplification of one preferred embodiment thereof. Many other variations are possible a few examples follow.<br>
The rigid Enclosure Roof of the enclosure can replaced with an assembly similar to the sidewalls, with Wall Sheets and Spacer Strips. The roof of the enclosure and the frame structure can have various shapes such as a pyramid, doom shaped or combination thereof. The sidewalls can have Wall Sheets of various materials either rigid or flexible. The sidewalls can use only one Wall sheet and eliminating the use of the Spacer Strips at the expense of energy bss. Various Clips, Shields, adhesives or combination thereof can fasten the sidewalls to the roof.<br>
The exit air opening on the sidewall can be eliminated along with the exit air duct of the Air Condition Unit thereby wasting the exit air and energy. The sidewalls can be left hanging on the bottom and not inserted under the bed or have a hole, whereby conditioned air would leak causing energy loss.<br>
The enclosure Frame structure instead of being located outside the enclosure could be placed inside and support the enclosure. The Frame Members can be of various material and cross-sectic»i. The Frame Members can also replace the Spacer Strips and be sandwiched between the Wall Sheets. The frame members can be joined together and to the roof by means such as adhesives, various fasteners or welding. The endosure can be colored and have other shapes such as circular, square or combination thereof, The shape of the Corner connectors can be varied to accommodate the various shape of the<br><br>
enclosure. The Enclosure sidewall can have slit opening for entry or exit to the enclosure that can be sealed and fastened by hook-and-loop fasteners etc.<br>
The components of the Air Condition Unit can be rearranged to serve the same purpose as this invention. The Air moving devises can be connected with a longer shaft driven by a single electric motor. The air conditioner or its control can be modified to work as a heat pump. This invertion uses a refrigerant cycle, and the heat transfer means that Includes the evaporative coil can be replaced with various thermal sinks such as Thermoelectric Solid State Coaling Systems to condition the air and achieve the same results. The blower assembly can be eliminated by having a larger Condensing coil. The Exhaust air duct can be eiirninated at the cost of making the exterior of the enclosure warmen<br>
The Unit size can be compacted by eliminating the Fresh Air Chamber and Heat transfer duct at the expense of energy conservation. The Heat transfer duct can be made of various materials with suitable properties for thermal energy transfer. The Channel Seat of the air ducts and the Endosure opening rims can be eliminated, and both can be mated wilii various processes such as heat fusion, adhesives and others. All the air ducts can have various cross section shapes and can be made of various suitable materials. The encbsure can be utilized for therapeutic use or to offer a climate-controlled environment to store or shelter nonhumans.<br>
