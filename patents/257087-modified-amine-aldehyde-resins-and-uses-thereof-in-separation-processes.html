				<td>CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
This application claims the benefit of priority of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No.<br>
60/638,143, filed December 23, 2004, and 60/713,339, filed September 2, 2005, each of which<br>
is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001] The present invention relates to modified resins for use in separation processes, and<br>
especially the selective separation of solids and/or ionic species such as metallic cations from<br>
aqueous media. Such processes include froth flotation (e.g., used in ore beneficiation), the<br>
separation of drill cuttings from oil drilling fluids, clay and coal slurry dewatering, sewage<br>
treatment, pulp and paper mill effluent processing, the removal of sand from bitumen, and the<br>
purification of water to render it potable. The modified resins comprise a base resin that is the<br>
reaction product of a primary or secondary amine and an aldehyde (e.g., a urea-formaldehyde<br>
resin). The base resin is modified with a coupling agent (e.g., a substituted silane) during or<br>
after its preparation.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Froth Flotation<br>
[0002] Industrially, processes for the purification of liquid suspensions or dispersions (and<br>
especially aqueous suspensions or dispersions) to remove suspended solid particles are quite<br>
prevalent. Froth flotation, for example, is a separation process based on differences in the<br>
tendency of various materials to associate with rising air bubbles. Additives are often<br>
incorporated into the froth flotation liquid (e.g., aqueous brine) to improve the selectivity of the<br>
process. For example, "collectors" can be used to chemically and/or physically absorb onto<br>
mineral(s) (e.g., those comprising value metals) to be floated, rendering them more hydrophobic.<br>
2<br><br>
On the other hand, "depressants," typically used in conjunction with collectors, render other<br>
materials (e.g., gangue minerals) less likely to associate with the air bubbles, and therefore less<br>
likely to be carried into the froth concentrate.<br>
[0003] In this manner, some materials (e.g., value minerals or metals) will, relative to others<br>
(e.g., gangue materials), exhibit preferential affinity for air bubbles, causing them to rise to the<br>
surface of the aqueous slurry, where they can be collected in a froth concentrate. A degree of<br>
separation is thereby effected. In less common, so-called reverse froth flotations, it is the<br>
gangue that is preferentially floated and concentrated at the surface, with the desired materials<br>
removed in the bottoms. Gangue materials typically refer to quartz, sand and clay silicates, and<br>
calcite, although other minerals (e.g., fluorite, barite, etc.,) may be included. In some cases, the<br>
material to be purified comprises predominantly such materials, and the smaller amounts of<br>
contaminants are preferentially floated. For example, in the beneficiation of kaolin clay, a<br>
material having a number of industrially significant applications, iron and titanium oxides can be<br>
separated by flotation from the impure, clay-containing ore, leaving a purified kaolin clay<br>
bottoms product.<br>
[0004] The manner in which known collectors and depressants achieve their effect is not<br>
understood with complete certainty, and several theories have been proposed to date.<br>
Depressants, for example may prevent the gangue minerals from adhering to the value materials<br>
to be separated, or they may even prevent the collectors) from absorbing onto the gangue<br>
minerals. Whatever the mechanism, the ability of a depressant to improve the selectivity in a<br>
froth flotation process can very favorably impact its economics.<br>
[0005] Overall, froth flotation is practiced in the beneficiation of a wide variety of value<br>
materials (e.g., mineral and metal ores and even high molecular weight hydrocarbons such as<br>
bitumen), in order to separate them from unwanted contaminants which are unavoidably co-<br>
extracted from natural deposits. In the case of solid ore beneficiation, froth flotation generally<br>
comprises grinding the crude ore into sufficiently small, discrete particles of a value mineral or<br>
metal and then contacting an aqueous "pulp" of this ground ore with rising air bubbles, typically<br>
while agitating the pulp. Prior to froth flotation, the crude ore may be subjected to any number<br>
of preconditioning steps, including selective crushing, screening, desliming, gravity<br>
concentration, electrical separation, low temperature roasting, and magnetic differentiation.<br>
3<br><br>
[0006] Another particular froth flotation process of commercial significance involves the<br>
separation of bitumen from sand and/or clay, which are ubiquitous in oil sand deposits, such as<br>
those found in the vast Athabasca region of Alberta, Canada. Bitumen is recognized as a<br>
valuable source of "semi-solid" petroleum or heavy hydrocarbon-containing crude oil, which<br>
can be upgraded into many valuable end products including transportation fuels such as gasoline<br>
or even petrochemicals. Alberta's oil sand deposits are estimated to contain 1.7 trillion barrels<br>
of bitumen-containing crude oil, exceeding the reserves in all of Saudi Arabia. For this reason,<br>
significant effort has been recently expended in developing economically feasible operations for<br>
bitumen recovery, predominantly based on subjecting an aqueous slurry of extracted oil sand to<br>
froth flotation. For example, the "Clark Process" involves recovering the bitumen in a froth<br>
concentrate while depressing the sand and other solid impurities.<br>
[0007] Various gangue depressants for improving froth flotation separations are known in the<br>
art and include sodium silicate, starch, tannins, dextrins, lignosulphonic acids, carboxyl methyl<br>
cellulose, cyanide salts and many others. More recently certain synthetic polymers have been<br>
found advantageous in particular beneficiation processes. For example, U.S. Patent No. Re.<br>
32,875 describes the separation of gangue from phosphate minerals (e.g., apatite) using as a<br>
depressant a phenol-formaldehyde copolymer (e.g., a resol, a novolak) or a modified phenol<br>
polymer (e.g., a melamine-modified novolak).<br>
[0008] U.S. Patent No. 3,990,965 describes the separation of iron oxide from bauxite using as<br>
a depressant a water soluble prepolymer of low chain length that adheres selectively to gangue<br>
and that can be further polymerized to obtain a cross-linked, insoluble resin.<br>
[0009] U.S. Patent No. 4,078,993 describes the separation of sulfide or oxidized sulfide ores<br>
(e.g., pyrite, pyrrhotite, or sphalerite) from metal mineral ores (e.g., copper, zinc, lead, nickel)<br>
using as a depressant a solution or dispersion of a low molecular weight condensation product of<br>
an aldehyde with a compound containing 2-6 amine or amide groups.<br>
[0010] U.S. Patent Nos. 4,128,475 and 4,208,487 describe the separation of gangue materials<br>
from mineral ore using a conventional frothing agent (e.g., pine oils) combined with a<br>
(preferably alkylated) amino-aldehyde resin that may have free methylol groups.<br>
[0011] U.S. Patent No. 4,139,455 describes the separation of sulfide or oxidized sulfide ores<br>
(eg., pyrite, pyrrhotite, or sphalerite) from metal mineral ores (e.g., copper, zinc, lead, nickel)<br>
4<br><br>
using as a depressant an amine compound (e.g., a polyamine) in which at least .20% of the total<br>
number of amine groups are tertiary amine groups and in which the number of quaternary amine<br>
groups is from 0 to not more than 1/3 the number of tertiary amine groups.<br>
[0012] U.S. Patent No. 5,047,144 describes the separation of siliceous materials (e.g.,<br>
feldspar) from minerals (e.g., kaolinite) using as a depressant a cation-active condensation<br>
product of aminoplast formers with formaldehyde, in combination with cation-active tensides<br>
(e.g., organic alkylamines) or anion-active tensides (e.g.. long-chained alkyl sulfonates).<br>
[0013] Russian Patent Nos. 427,737 and 276,845 describe the depression of clay slime using<br>
carboxymethyl cellulose and urea-formaldehyde resins, optionally combined with methacrylic<br>
acid-methacrylamide copolymers or starch ('845 patent).<br>
[0014] Russian Patent Nos. 2,169,740; 2,165,798; and 724,203 describe the depression of clay<br>
carbonate slimes from ores in the potassium industry, including sylvinite (KCl-NaCl) ores. The<br>
depressant used is a urea/formaldehyde condensation product that is modified by<br>
polyethylenepolyamine. Otherwise, a guanidine-formaldehyde resin is employed ('203 patent).<br>
[0015] Markin, A.D., et. al., describe the use of urea-formaldehyde resins as carbonate clay<br>
depressors in the flotation of potassium ores. Study of the Hydrophilizing Action of Urea-'<br>
Formaldehyde Resins on Carbonate Clay Impurities in Potassium Ores, Inst. Obshch.<br>

Doklady Akademii Nauk BSSR (1974).<br>
[0016] As is recognized in the art, a great diversity cf materials can be subject to<br>
beneficiation/refinement by froth flotation. Likewise, the nature of both the desired and the<br>
unwanted components varies greatly. This is due to the differences in chemical composition of<br>
these materials, as well as in the types of prior chemical treatment and processing steps used.<br>
Consequently, the number and type of froth flotation depressants is correspondingly wide.<br>
[0017] Also, the use of a given depressant in one service (e.g., raw potassium ore<br>
beneficiation) is not a predictor of its utility in an application involving a significantly different<br>
feedstock (e.g., bitumen-containing oil sand). This also applies to any expectation regarding the<br>
5<br><br>
use of a depressant that is effective in froth flotation, in the any of the separations of solid<br>
contaminants from aqueous liquid suspensions, described below (and vice versa). The<br>
theoretical mechanisms by which froth flotation and aqueous liquid/solid separations occur are<br>
significantly different, where the former process relies on differences in hydrophobicity and the<br>
latter on several other possibilities (charge destabilization/neutralization, agglomeration, host-<br>
guest theory (including podands), hard-soft acid base theory, dipole-dipole interactions, Highest<br>
Occupied Molecular Orbital-Lowest unoccupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO-LUMO)<br>
interactions, hydrogen bonding, Gibbs free energy of bonding, etc). Traditional depressants in<br>
froth flotation for the benefication of metallic ores, such as guar gum, are not employed as<br>
dewatering agents, or even as depressants in froth flotation for bitumen separation. Moreover, in<br>
two of the applications described below (waste clay and coal dewatering), no agents are<br>
currently used to improve the solid/liquid separation. Overall, despite the large offering of<br>
flotation depressants and dewatering agents in the art, an adequate degree of refinement in many<br>
cases remains difficult to achieve, even, in the case of froth flotation, when two or more<br>
sequential "rougher" and "cleaner" flotations are employed. There is therefore a need in the art<br>
for agents which can be effectively employed in a wide range of separation processes, including<br>
both froth flotation and the separation of solid contaminants from liquid suspensions.<br>
Other Separations<br>
[0018] Other processes, in addition to froth flotation, for the separation of solid contaminants<br>
from liquid suspensions can involve the use of additives that either destabilize these suspensions<br>
or otherwise bind the contaminants into larger agglomerates. Coagulation, for example, refers to<br>
the destabilization of suspended solid particles by neutralizing the electric charge that separates<br>
them. Flocculation refers to the bridging or agglomeration of solid particles together into<br>
clumps or floes, thereby facilitating their separation by settling or flotation, depending on the<br>
density of the floes relative to the liquid. Otherwise, filtration may be employed as a means to<br>
separate the larger floes.<br>
[0019] The additives described above, and especially flocculants, are often employed, for<br>
example, in the separation of solid particles of rock or drill cuttings from oil and gas well<br>
drilling fluids. These drilling fluids (often referred to as "drilling muds") are important in the<br>
drilling process for several reasons, including cooling and lubricating the drill bit, establishing a<br>
fluid counterpressure to prevent high-pressure oil, gas, and/or water formation fluids from<br>
6<br><br>
entering the well prematurely, and hindering the collapse of the uncased wellbore. Drilling<br>
muds, whether water- or oil-based, also remove drill cuttings from the drilling area and transport<br>
them to the surface. Flocculants such as acrylic polymers are commonly used to agglomerate<br>
these cuttings at the surface of the circulating drilling mud, where they can be separated from the<br>
drilling mud.<br>
[0020] Other uses for flocculants in solid/liquid separations include the agglomeration of clays<br>
which are suspended in the large waste slurry effluents from phosphate production facilities.<br>
Flocculants such as anionic natural or synthetic polymers, which may be combined with a<br>
fibrous material such as recycled newspaper, are often used for this purpose. The aqueous clay<br>
slurries fonned in phosphate purification plants typically have a flow rate of over 100,000<br>
gallons per minute and generally contain less than 5% solids by weight. The dewatering (or<br>
settling) of this waste clay, which allows for recycle of the water, presents one of the most<br>
difficult problems associated with reclamation. The settling ponds used for this dewatering<br>
normally make up about half of the mined area, and dewatering time can be on the order of<br>
several months to several years.<br>
[0021] In the separation of solids from aqueous liquids, other specific applications of<br>
industrial importance include the filtration of coal from water-containing slurries (i.e., coa!<br>
slurry dewatering), the treatment of sewage to remove contaminants (e.g., sludge) via<br>
sedimentation, and the processing of pulp and paper mill effluents to remove suspended<br>
cellulosic solids. The dewatering of coal poses a significant problem industrially, as the BTU<br>
value of coal decreases with increasing water content. Raw sewage, both industrial and<br>
municipal, requires enormous treatment capacity, as wastes generated by the U.S. population,<br>
for example, are collected into sewer systems and carried along by approximately 14 billion<br>
gallons of water per day, Paper industry effluent streams likewise represent large volumes of<br>
solid-containing aqueous liquids, as waste water generated from a typical paper plant often<br>
exceeds 25 million gallons per day. The removal of sand from aqueous bitumen-containing<br>
slurries generated in the extraction and subsequent processing of oil sands, as described<br>
previously, poses another commercially significant challenge in the purification of aqueous<br>
liquid suspensions. Also, the removal of suspended solid particulates is often an important<br>
consideration in the purification of water, such as in the preparation of drinking (i.e., potable)<br>
water. Synthetic polyacrylamides, as well as naturally-occurring hydrocolloidal polysaccharides<br>
7<br><br>
such as alginates (copolymers of D-mannuronic and L-guluronic acids) and guar gum are<br>
flocculants in this service.<br>
[0022] The above applications therefore provide several specific examples relating to the<br>
treatment of aqueous liquid suspensions to remove solid particulates. However, such<br>
separations are common in a vast number of other processes in the mineral, chemical, industrial<br>
and municipal waste, sewage treatment, and paper industries, as well as in a wide variety of<br>
other water-consuming industries. Thus, there is a need in the art for additives that can<br>
effectively promote selective separation of a wide variety of solid contaminants from liquid<br>
suspensions. Advantageously, such agents should be selective in chemically interacting with the<br>
solid contaminants, through coagulation, flocculation, or other mechanisms such that the<br>
removal of these contaminants is easily effected. Especially desirable are additives that are also<br>
able to complex unwanted ionic species such as metal cations to facilitate their removal as well.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
All Uses<br>
[0023] The present invention is directed to modified resins for removing, generally in a<br>
selective fashion, a wide variety of solids and/or ionic species from the liquids in which they are<br>
suspended and/or dissolved. These modified resins are especially useful as froth flotation<br>
depressants in the beneficiation of many types of materials including mineral and metal ores,<br>
such as in the beneficiation of kaolin clay. The modified resins are also useful for treating<br>
aqueous liquid suspensions {e.g., aqueous suspensions containing sand, clay, coal, and/or other<br>
solids, such as used drill cutting fluids, as well as process and effluent streams in phosphate and<br>
 coal production, sewage treatment, paper manufacturing, or bitumen recovery facilities) to<br>
remove solid particulates and also potentially metallic cations {e.g., in the purification of<br>
drinking water). The modified resins comprise a base resin that is modified with a coupling<br>
agent. The coupling agent is highly selective for binding to solid contaminants and especially v<br>
siliceous materials such as sand or clay.<br>
8<br><br>
Froth Flotation<br>
[0024] Without being bound by theory, the coupling agent is highly selective in froth flotation<br>
separations for binding to either gangue or desired {e.g., kaolin clay) materials and especially<br>
siliceous gangue materials such as sand or clay. Also, because the base resin has affinity for<br>
water, the materials which interact and associate with the coupling agent, are effectively<br>
sequestered in the aqueous phase in froth flotation processes. Consequently, the gangue<br>
materials can be selectively separated from the value materials {e.g., minerals, metals, or<br>
bitumen) or clay-containing ore impurities {e.g., iron and titanium oxides) that are isolated in the<br>
froth concentrate.<br>
[0025] Accordingly, in one embodiment, the present invention is a method for beneficiation of<br>
an ore. The method comprises treating a slurry of ore particles with, a depressant comprising a<br>
modified resin. The modified resin comprises a base resin that is the reaction product of a<br>
primary or a secondary amine and an aldehyde, and the base resin is modified with a coupling<br>
agent. The ore slurry treatment may occur before or during froth flotation. In one embodiment,<br>
the ore comprises sand or clay impurities, and is typically an ore that is recovered in phosphate<br>
or potassium mining. In another embodiment, the base resin is a urea-formaldehyde resin. In<br>
another embodiment, the coupling agent is selected from the group consisting of a substituted<br>

[0026] In another embodiment, the present invention is a froth flotation depressant for<br>
beneficiation of vaiue materials, including minerals or value metal ores. The depressant<br>
comprises a modified resin in a solution or dispersion having a resin solids content from about<br>
30% to about 90% by weight. The modified resin comprises a base resin that is the reaction<br>
product of a primary or secondary amine and an aldehyde. The base resin is modified with a<br>
coupling agent. The coupling agent is present in an amount representing from about 0.1% to<br>
about 2.5% of the weight of the solution or dispersion, having a resin solids content from about<br>
30% to about 90% by weight. In another embodiment, the base resin is a urea-formaldehyde<br>
resin that is the reaction product of urea and formaldehyde at a formaldehyde : urea (F:U) molar<br>

silane selected from the group consisting of a ureido substituted silane, an amino substituted<br>
silane, a sulfur substituted silane, an epoxy substituted silane, a methacryl substituted silane, a<br>
vinyl substituted silane, an alkyl substituted silane, and a haloalkyl substituted silane.<br>
9<br><br>
[0027] In another embodiment, the present invention is a method for purifying clay from a<br>
clay-containing ore comprising an impurity selected from a metal, a metal oxide, a mineral, and<br>
mixtures thereof. The method comprises treating a slurry of the clay-containing ore with a<br>
depressant comprising a modified resin and recovering, by froth flotation of the impurity either<br>
after or during the treating step, a purified clay having a reduced amount at least one of the<br>
impurities. The modified resin comprises a base resin that is the reaction product of a primary<br>
or a secondary amine and an aldehyde. The base resin is modified with a coupling agent. In<br>
another embodiment, the clay-containing ore comprises kaolin clay. In another embodiment, the<br>
impurity comprises a mixture of iron oxide and titanium dioxide. In another embodiment, the<br>
impurity comprises coal.<br>
[0028] In another embodiment, the present invention is a method for purifying bitumen from a<br>
bitumen-containing slurry comprising sand or clay. The method comprises treating the slurry<br>
with a depressant comprising the modified resin described above and recovering, by froth<br>
flotation either after or during the treating step, purified bitumen having a reduced amount of<br>
sand or clay.<br>
Other Separations<br>
[0029] In another embodiment, the present invention is a method for purifying an aqueous<br>
liquid suspension comprising a solid contaminant. The method comprises treating the liquid<br>
suspension with a modified resin as described above and removing, either after or during the<br>
treating step, (1) at least a portion of the solid contaminant in a contaminant-rich fraction and/or<br>
(2) a purified liquid. In another embodiment, the treating step comprises flocculating the solid<br>
contaminant (e.g., sand or clay). In another embodiment, the removing step is carried out by<br>
sedimentation, flotation, or filtration. In another embodiment, the liquid suspension is an oil<br>

BRIEF DESCRIPTION'OF THE DRAWING<br>
[0032] Fig. 1 illustrates the performance, in the flotation of a sample of ground potassium ore,<br>
of silane coupling agent-modified urea-formaldehyde resins having a molecular weight within<br>
the range of 400-1200 grams/mole. The performance is shown relative to unmodified resins<br>
(i.e., without an added silane coupling agent) and also relative to a guar gum control sample.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
All Uses<br>
[0033] The modified resin that is used in separation processes of the present invention<br>
comprises a base resin that is the reaction product of a primary or secondary amine and an<br>
aldehyde. The primary or secondary amine, by virtue of having a nitrogen atom that is not<br>
completely substituted (i.e., that is not part of a tertiary or quaternary amine) is capable of<br>
reacting with an aldehyde, to form an adduct. If formaldehyde is used as the aldehyde, for<br>
example, the adduct is a methylolated adduct having reactive methylol functionalities.<br>
Representative primary and secondary amines used to form the base resin include compounds<br>
having at least two functional amine or amide groups, or amidine compounds having at least one<br>
11<br><br>
of each of these groups. Such compounds include ureas, guanidines, and melamines, which may<br>
be substituted at their respective amine nitrogen atoms with aliphatic or aromatic radicals,<br>
wherein at least two nitrogen atoms are not completely substituted. Primary amines are often<br>
used. Representative of these is urea, which has a low cost and is extensively available<br>
commercially. In the case of urea, if desired, at least a portion thereof can be replaced with<br>
ammonia, primary alkylamines, alkanolamines, polyamines {e.g., alkyl primary diamines such<br>
as ethylene diamine and alkyl primary triamines such as diethylene triamine),<br>
polyalkanolamines, melamine or other amine-substituted triazines, dicyandiamide, substituted or<br>
cyclic ureas {e.g., ethylene urea), primary amines, secondary amines and alkylamines, tertiary<br>
amines and alkylamines, guanidine, and guanidine derivatives {e.g., cyanoguanidine and<br>
acetoguanidine). Aluminum sulfate, cyclic phosphates and cyclic phosphate esters, formic acid<br>
or other organic acids may also be used in conjunction with urea. The amount of any one of<br>
these components (or if used in combination then their combined amount), if incoiporated into<br>
the resin to replace part of the urea, typically will vary from about 0.05 to about 20% by weight<br>
of the resin solids. These types of agents promote hydrolysis resistance, flexibility, reduced<br>
aldehyde emissions and other characteristics, as is appreciated by those having skill in the art.<br>
[0034] The aldehyde used to react with the primary or secondary amine as described above, to<br>
form the base resin, may be formaldehyde, or other aliphatic aldehydes such as acetaldehyde and<br>
propionaldehyde. Aldehydes also include aromatic aldehydes {e.g., benzylaldehyde and<br>
furfural), and other aldehydes such as aldol, glyoxal, and crotonaldehyde. Mixtures of<br>
aldehydes may also be used. Generally, due to its commercial availability and relatively low<br>
cost, formaldehyde is used.<br>
[0035] In forming the base resin, the initial formation of an adduct between the amine and the<br>
aldehyde is well known in the art. The rate of the aldehyde addition reaction is generally highly<br>
dependent on pH and the degree of substitution achieved. For example, the rate of addition of<br>
formaldehyde to urea to form successively one, two, and three methylol groups has been<br>
estimated to be in the ratio of 9 : 3 : 1, while tetramethylolurea is normally not produced in a<br>
significant quantity. The adduct formation reaction typically proceeds at a favorable rate under<br>
alkaline conditions and thus in the presence of a suitable alkaline catalyst {e.g., ammonia, alkali<br>
metal hydroxides, or alkaline earth metal hydroxides). Sodium hydroxide is most widely used.<br>
12<br><br>
[0036] At sufficiently high pH values, it is possible for the adduct formation reaction to<br>
proceed essentially in the absence of condensation reactions that increase the resin molecular<br>
weight by polymerization (i.e., that advance the resin). However, for the formation of low<br>
molecular weight condensate resins from the further reaction of the amine-aldehyde adduct, the<br>
reaction mixture is generally maintained at a pH of greater than about 5 and typically from about<br>
5 to about 9. If desired, an acid such as acetic acid can be added to help control the pH and<br>
therefore the rate of condensation and ultimately the molecular weight of the condensed resin.<br>
The reaction temperature is normally in the range from about 30°C to about 120°C, typically less<br>
than about 85°C, and often the reflux temperature is used. A reaction time from about from<br>
about 15 minutes to about 3 hours, and typically from about 30 minutes to about 2 hours, is used<br>
in preparing the low molecular weight amine-aldehyde condensate resin from the primary or<br>
secondary amine and aldehyde starting materials.<br>
[0037] Various additives may be incorporated, prior to or during the condensation reaction, in<br>
order to impart desired properties into the final modified amine-aldehyde resin. For example,<br>
guar gum; carboxymethylcellulose or other polysaccharides such as alginates; or polyols such as<br>
polyvinyl alcohols, pentaerythitol, or Jeffol™ polyols (Hunstman Corporation, Salt Lake City,<br>
Utah, USA) may be used to alter the viscosity and consistency of the amine-aldehyde resin<br>
condensate, which when used to prepare the modified amine-aldehyde resin, can improve its<br>
performance in froth flotation and other applications. Otherwise, quaternary ammonium salts<br>
including diallyl dimethyl ammonium chloride (or analogs such as diallyl diethyl ammonium<br>
chloride) or alkylating agents including epichlorohydrin (or analogs such as epibromohydrin)<br>
may be used to increase the cationic charge of the amine-aldehyde resin condensate, which when<br>
used to prepare the modified amine-aldehyde resin, can improve its performance in certain<br>
solid/liquid separations (e.g., clay dewatering) discussed below. In this manner, such additives<br>
may be more effectively reacted into the modified amine-aldehyde resin than merely blended<br>
with the resin after its preparation.<br>
[0038] Condensation reaction products of the amine-aldehyde, amide-aldehyde, and/or<br>
amidine-aldehyde adducts described above include, for example those products resulting from<br>
the formation of (i) methylene bridges between amido nitrogens by the reaction of alkylol and<br>
amino groups, (ii) methylene ether linkages by the reaction of two alkylol groups, (iii)<br>
methylene   linkages   from   methylene  ether  linkages  with   the   subsequent   removal   of<br>
13<br><br>
formaldehyde, and (iv) methylene linkages from alkylol groups with the subsequent removal of<br>
water and formaldehyde.<br>
[0039] Generally, in preparing the base resin, the molar ratio of aldehyde : primary or<br>
secondary amine is from about 1.5:1 to about 4:1, which refers to the ratio of moles of all<br>
aldehydes to moles of all amines, amides, and amidines reacted to prepare the base resin during<br>
the course of the adduct formation and condensation reactions described above, whether<br>
performed separately or simultaneously. The resin is normally prepared under ambient pressure.<br>
The viscosity of the reaction mixture is often used as a convenient proxy for the resin molecular<br>
weight. Therefore the condensation reaction can be stopped when a desired viscosity is<br>
achieved after a sufficiently long time and at a sufficiently high temperature. At this point, the<br>
reaction mixture can be cooled and neutralized. Water may be removed by vacuum distillation<br>
to give a resin with a desired solids content. Any of a wide variety of conventional procedures<br>
used for reacting primary and secondary amine and aldehyde components can be used, such as<br>
staged monomer addition, staged catalyst addition, pH control, amine modification, etc., and the<br>
present invention is not limited to any particular procedure.<br>
[0040] A representative base resin for use in separation processes of the present invention is a<br>
urea-formaldehdye resin. As described above, a portion of the urea may be replaced by other<br>
reactive amine and/or amides and a portion of the formaldehyde may be replaced by other<br>
aldehydes, to provide various desirable properties, without departing from the characterization<br>
of the base resin as a urea-formaldehyde resin. Urea-formaldehyde resins, when used as the<br>
base resin, can be prepared from urea and formaldehyde monomers or from precondensates in<br>
manners well known to those skilled in the art. Generally, the urea and formaldehyde are<br>
reacted at a molar ratio of formaldehyde to urea (F:U) in the range from about 1.75:1 to about<br>
3:1, and typically at a formaldehyde : urea (F:U) mole ratio from about 2:1 to about 3:1, in order<br>
to provide sufficient methylolated species for resin cross-linking (e.g., di- and tri-methylolated<br>
ureas). Generally, the urea-formaldehyde resin is a highly water dilutable dispersion, if not an<br>
aqueous solution.<br>
[0041] In one embodiment, the condensation is allowed to proceed to an extent such that the<br>
urea-formaldehyde base resin has a number average molecular weight (Mn), of greater than<br>
about 300 grams/mole, and typically from about 400 to about 1200 grams/mole. As is known in<br>
14<br><br><br>
the art, the value of Mn of a polymer sample having a distribution of molecular weights is<br>
defined as<br>
[0042] where Nj is the number of polymer species having i repeat units and Mj is the<br>
molecular weight of the polymer species having i repeat units. The number average molecular<br>
weight is typically determined using gel permeation chromatography (GPC), using solvent.,<br>
standards, and procedures well known to those skilled in the art.<br>
[0043] A cyclic urea-formaldehyde resin may also be employed and prepared, for example,<br>
according to procedures described in U.S. Patent No. 6,114,491. Urea, formaldehyde, and<br>
ammonia reactants are used in a mole ratio of urea : formaldehyde : ammonia that may be about<br>
0.1 to 1.0 : about 0.1 to 3.0 : about 0.1 to 1.0. These reactants are charged to a reaction vessel<br>
while maintaining the temperature below about 70°C (160°F), often about 60°C (MOT). The<br>
order of addition is not critical, but it is important to take care during the addition of ammonia to<br>
formaldehyde (or formaldehyde to ammonia), due to the exothermic reaction. In fact, due to the<br>
strong exotherm, it may be preferred to charge the formaldehyde and the urea first, followed by<br>
the ammonia. This sequence of addition allows one to take advantage of the endotherm caused<br>
by the addition of urea to water to increase the rate of ammonia addition. A base may be<br>
required to maintain an alkaline condition throughout the cook.<br>
[0044] Once all the reactants are in the reaction vessel, the resulting solution is heated at an<br>
alkaline pH to between about 60 and 105°C (about 140 to about 220°F), often about 85 to 95°C<br>
(about 185 to 205°F), for 30 minutes to 3 hours, depending on mole ratio and temperature, or<br>
until the reaction is complete. Once the reaction is complete, the solution is cooled to room<br>
temperature for storage. The resulting solution is storage stable for several months at ambient<br>
conditions. The pH is between 5 and 11.<br>
[0045] The yield is usually about 100%. The cyclic urea resins often contain at least 20%<br>
triazone and substituted triazone compounds. The ratio of cyclic ureas to di- and tri- substituted<br>
ureas and mono-substituted ureas varies with the mole ratio of the reactants. For example, a<br>
cyclic urea resin having the mole ratio of 1.0:2.0:0.5 U:F:A resulted in a solution characterized<br>
by CI3-NMR and containing approximately 42.1% cyclic ureas, 28.5% di/tri-substituted ureas,<br>
15<br><br>
24.5% mono-substituted ureas, and 4.9% free urea. A cyclic urea resin having the mole ratio of<br>
1.0:1.2:0.5 U:F:A resulted in a solution characterized by CI3-NMR and containing<br>
approximately 25.7% cyclic ureas, 7.2% di/tri-substituted ureas, 31.9% mono-substituted ureas,<br>
and 35.2 free urea.<br>
[0046] In addition, the cyclic urea-formaldehyde resin may be prepared by a method such as<br>
described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,674,971. The cyclic urea resin is prepared by reacting urea and<br>
formaldehyde in at least a two step and optionally a three-step process. In the first step,<br>
conducted under alkaline reaction conditions, urea and formaldehyde are reacted in the presence<br>
of ammonia, at an F/U mole ratio of between about 1.2:1 and 1.8:1. The ammonia is supplied in<br>
an amount sufficient to yield an ammonia/urea mole ratio of between about 0.05:1 and 1.2:1. :<br>
The mixture is reacted to form a cyclic triazone/triazine or cyclic urea resin.<br>
[0047] Water soluble triazone compounds may also be prepared by reacting urea,<br>
formaldehyde and a primary amine as described in U.S. Patent Nos. 2,641,584 and 4,778,510.<br>
These patents also describe suitable primary amines such as, but are not limited to, alkyl amines<br>
such as methyl amine, ethyl amine, and propyl amine, lower hydroxyamines such as<br>
ethanolamine cycloalkylmonoamines such as cyclopentylamine, ethylenediamine,<br>
hexamethylenediamine, and linear polyamines. The primary amine may be substituted or<br>
unsubstituted.<br>
[0048] In the case of a cyclic urea-formaldehyde or a urea-formaldehyde resin, skilled<br>
practitioners recognize that the urea and formaldehyde reactants are commercially available in<br>
many forms. Any form which is sufficiently reactive and which does not introduce extraneous<br>
moieties deleterious to the desired reactions and reaction products can be used in the preparation<br>
of urea-formaldehyde resins useful in the invention. For example, commonly used forms of<br>
formaldehyde include paraform (solid, polymerized formaldehyde) and formalin solutions<br>
(aqueous solutions of formaldehyde, sometimes with methanol, in 37 percent, 44 percent, or 50<br>
percent formaldehyde concentrations). Formaldehyde also is available as a gas. Any of these<br>
forms is suitable for use in preparing a urea-formaldehyde base resin. Typically, formalin<br>
solutions are used as the formaldehyde source. To prepare the base resin of the present<br>
invention, formaldehyde may be substituted in whole or in part with any of the aldehydes<br>
described above (e.g., glyoxal).<br>
16<br><br>
[0049] Similarly, urea is commonly available in a variety of forms. Solid urea, such as prill,<br>
and urea solutions, typically aqueous solutions, are commercially available. Any form of urea is<br>
suitable for use in the practice of the invention. For example, many commercially prepared<br>
urea-formaldehyde solutions may be used, including combined urea-formaldehyde products<br>
such as Urea-Formaldehyde Concentrate (e.g., UFC 85) as disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos.<br>
5,362,842 and 5,389,716.<br>
[0050] Also, urea-formaldehyde resins such as the types sold by Georgia Pacific Resins, Inc.,<br>
Borden Chemical Co., and Neste Resins Corporation may be used. These resins are prepared as<br>
either low molecular weight condensates or as adducts which, as described above, contain<br>
reactive methylol groups that can undergo condensation to form resin polymers, typically within<br>
the number average molecular weight ranges described previously. The resins will generally<br>
contain small amounts of unreacted (i.e., free) urea and formaldehyde, as well as cyclic ureas,<br>
mono-methylolated urea, and di- and tri-methylolated ureas. The relative quantities of ihese<br>
species can vary, depending on the preparation conditions (e.g., the molar formaldehyde : urea<br>
ratio used). The balance of these resins is generally water, ammonia, and formaldehyde.<br>
Various additives known in the art, including stabilizers, cure promoters, fillers, extenders, etc.,<br>
may also be added to the base resin.<br>
[0051] Modified resins of the present invention are prepared by modifying the base resin, as<br>
described above, with a coupling agent that is highly selective for binding with unwanted solid<br>
materials (e.g., sand or clay) and/or ionic species such as metallic cations to be separated in the<br>
separation/purification processes of the present invention. Without being bound by theory, the<br>
coupling agent is believed to improve the ability of the base resin, which, in one embodiment, is<br>
generally cationic (i.e., carries more overall positive than negative charge) to attract most clay<br>
surfaces, which are generally anionic (i.e., carry more overall negative than positive charge).<br>
These differences in electronic characteristics between the base resin and clay can result in<br>
mutual attraction at multiple sites and even the potential sharing of electrons to form covalent<br>
bonds. The positive-negative charge interactions which cause clay particles to become attracted<br>
to the base resin is potentially explained by several theories, such as host-guest theory (including<br>
podands), hard-soft acid base theory, dipole-dipole interactions, and Highest Occupied<br>
Molecular Orbital-Lowest unoccupied Molecular Orbital (H0M0-LUM0) interactions,<br>
hydrogen bonding, Gibbs free energy of bonding, etc.<br>
17<br><br>
[0052] The coupling agent may be added before, during, or after the adduct-forming reaction,<br>
as described above, between the primary or secondary amine and the aldehyde. For example,<br>
the coupling agent may be added after an amine-aldehyde adduct is formed under alkaline<br>
conditions, but prior to reducing the pH of the adduct (e.g., by addition of an acid) to effect<br>
condensation reactions. Normally, the coupling agent is covalently bonded to the base resin by<br>
reaction between a base resin-reactive functional group of the coupling agent and a moiety of the<br>
base resin.<br>
[0053] The coupling agent may also be added after the condensation reactions that yield a low<br>
molecular weight polymer. For example, the coupling agent may be added after increasing the<br>
pH of the condensate (e.g., by addition of a base) to halt condensation reactions.<br>
Advantageously, it has been found that the base resin may be sufficiently modified by<br>
introducing the coupling agent to the resin condensate at an alkaline pH (i.e., above pH 7),<br>
without appreciably advancing the resin molecular weight. Typically, the resin condensate is in<br>
the form of an aqueous solution or dispersion of the resin. When substituted silanes are used as<br>
coupling agents, they can effectively modify the base resin under alkaline conditions and at<br>
either ambient or elevated temperatures. Any temperature associated with adduct formation or<br>
condensate formation during the preparation of the base resin, as described above, is suitable for<br>
incorporation of the silane coupling agent to modify the base resin. Thus, the coupling agent<br>
may be added to the amine-aldehyde mixture, adduct, or condensate at a temperature ranging<br>
from ambient to about 100°C. Generally, an elevated temperature from about 35°C to about<br>
45°C is used to achieve a desirable rate of reaction between the base resin-reactive group of the<br>
substituted silane and the base resin itself. As with the resin condensation reactions described<br>
previously, the extent of this reaction may be monitored by the increase in the viscosity of the<br>
resin solution or dispersion over time.<br>
[0054] Alternatively, in some cases the silane coupling agent may be added to the liquid that is<br>
to be purified (e.g., the froth flotation slurry) and that contains the base resin, in order to modify<br>
the base resin in situ.<br>
[0055] Representative coupling agents that can modify the base resin of the present invention<br>
and that also have the desired binding selectivity or affinity for impurities such as sand, clay,<br>
and/or ionic species include substituted silanes, which posses both a base resin-reactive group<br>
(e.g., an organorunctional group) and a second group (e.g., a trimethoxysilane group) that is<br>
18<br><br>
capable of adhering to, or interacting with, unwanted impurities (especially siliceous materials).<br>
Without being bound by theory, the second group may effect the agglomeration of these<br>
impurities into larger particles or floes (i.e., by flocculation), upon treatment with the modified<br>
resin. This facilitates their removal. In the case of ore froth flotation separations, this second<br>
group of the coupling agent promotes the sequestering of either gangue impurities or desired<br>
materials (e.g., kaolin clay) in the aqueous phase, in which the base resin is soluble or for which<br>
the base resin has a high affinity. This improves the separation of value materials from the<br>
aqueous phase by flotation with a gas such as air.<br>
[0056] Representative base resin-reactive groups of the silane coupling agents include, but are<br>
not limited to, ureido-containing moieties (e.g., ureidoalkyl groups), amino-containing moieties<br>
(e.g., aminoalkyl groups), sulfur-containing moieties (e.g., mercaptoalkyl groups), epoxy-<br>
containing moieties (e.g., glycidoxyalkyl groups), methacryl-containing moieties (e.g.,<br>
methacryloxyalkyl groups), vinyl-containing moieties (e.g., vinylbenzylamino groups), alkyl-<br>
containing moieties (e.g., methyl groups), or haloalkyl-containing moieties (e.g., chloroalkyl<br>
groups). Representative substituted silane coupling agents of the present invention therefore<br>
include ureido substituted silanes, amino substituted silanes, sulfur substituted silanes, epoxy<br>
substituted silanes, methacryl substituted silanes, vinyl substituted silanes, alkyl substituted<br>
silanes, and haloalkyl substituted silanes.<br>
[0057] It is also possible for the silane coupling agent to be substituted with more than one<br>
base-resin reactive group. For example, the tetravalent silicon atom of the silane coupling agent<br>
may be independently substituted with two or three of the base-resin reactive groups described<br>
above. As an alternative to, or in addition to, substitution with multiple base-resin reactive<br>
groups, the silane coupling agent may also have multiple silane functionalities, to improve the<br>
strength or capacity of the coupling agent in bonding with either gangue impurities such as sand<br>
or desired materials such as kaolin clay. The degree of silylation of the silane coupling agent<br>
can be increased, for example, by incorporating additional silane groups into coupling agent or<br>
by cross-linking the coupling agent with additional silane-containing moieties. The use of<br>
multiple silane functionalities may even result in a different orientation between the coupling<br>
agent and clay surface (e.g., affinity between the clay surface and multiple silane groups at the<br>
"side" of the coupling agent, versus affinity between a single silane group at the "head" of the<br>
coupling agent.<br>
19<br><br>
[0058] The silane coupling agents also comprise a second group, as described above, which<br>
includes the silane portion of the molecule, that is typically substituted with one or more groups<br>
selected from alkoxy (e.g., trimethoxy), acyloxy (e.g., acetoxy), alkoxyalkoxy (e.g.,<br>
methoxyethoxy), aryloxy (e.g., phenoxy), aroyloxy (e.g., benzoyloxy), heteroaryloxy (e.g.,<br>
furfuroxy), haloaryloxy (e.g., chlorophenoxy), heterocycloalkyloxy (e.g., tetrahydrofurfuroxy),<br>
and the like. Representative silane coupling agents, having both base resin-reactive groups and<br>
second groups (e.g., gangue-reactive groups) as described above, for use in modifying the base<br>
resin, therefore include ureidopropyltrimethoxysilane, ureidopropyltriethoxysilane,<br>
aminopropyltrimethoxysilane, aminopropyltriethoxysilane, aminopropylmethyldiethoxysilane,<br>
aminopropylmethyldimethoxysilane,	aminoethylaminopropyltrimethoxysilane,<br>

[0059] Other representative silane coupling agents include oligomeric aminoalkylsilanes<br>
having, as a base resin-reactive group, two or more repeating aminoalkyl or alkylamino groups<br>
bonded in succession. An example of an oligomeric aminoalkylsilane is the solution Silane<br>
A1106, available under the trade name Silquest (GE Silicones-OSi Specialties, Wilton, CT,<br>
USA), which is believed to have the general formula (NH2CH2CH2SiO1.5),,, wherein n is<br>
from 1 to about 3. Modified aminosilanes such as a triaminosilane solution (e.g., Silane A1128,<br>
available under the same trade name and from the same supplier) may also be employed.<br>
[0060] Other representative silane coupling agents are the ureido substituted and amino<br>
substituted     silanes     as    described     above.	Specific     examples     of    these     are<br>
ureidopropyltrimethoxysilane, ureidopropyltriethoxysilane, aminopropyltrimethoxysilane, and<br>
aminopropyltriethoxysilane.<br>
[0061] Polysiloxanes and polysiloxane derivatives may also be used as coupling agents, as<br>
described above, to enhance the performance of the modified base resin in solid/liquid<br>
separations. Polysiloxane derivatives include those polyorganosiloxanes obtained from the<br>
blending of organic resins with polysiloxane resins to incorporate various functionalities therein,<br>
including urethane, acrylate, epoxy, vinyl, and alkyl functionalities.<br>
[0062] Silica and/or silicates may be used in conjunction (e.g., added as a blending<br>
component) with the modified resin of the present invention to potentially improve its affinity<br>
for either gangue impurities or desired materials (e.g., kaolin clay), especially siliceous materials<br>
including sand and clay. Other agents that may be used to improve the performance of modified<br>
resins in the separation processes of the present invention include polysaccharides, polyvinyl<br>
alcohol, polyacrylamide, as well as known flocculants (e.g., alginates). These agents can<br>
likewise be used with modified urea-formaldehyde resins wherein, as described above, at least a<br>
portion of the urea is replaced with ammonia or an amine as described above (e.g., primary<br>
alkylamines, alkanolamines, polyamines, etc.). Otherwise, such agents can also be used with the<br>
modified resins, which are further modified with anionic functional groups (e.g., sulfonate) or<br>
stabilized by reaction with an alcohol (e.g., methanol), as described below.<br>
[0063] Silica in the form of an aqueous silica sol, for example, is available from Akzo Nobel<br>
under the Registered Trademark "Bindzil" or from DuPont under the Registered Trademark<br>
"Ludox". Other grades of sol are available having various particle sizes of colloidal silica and<br>
containing various stabilizers.    The sol can be stabilized by alkali, for example sodium,<br>
21<br><br>
potassium, or lithium hydroxide or quaternary ammonium hydroxide, or by a water-soluble<br>
organic amine such as alkanolamine.<br>
[0064] Silicates, such as alkali and alkaline earth metal silicates {e.g., lithium silicate, sodium-<br>
lithium silicate, potassium silicate, magnesium silicate, and calcium silicate), as well as<br>
ammonium silicate or a quaternary ammonium silicate, may also be used in the preparation of a<br>
modified resin. Additionally, stabilized colloidal silica-silicate blends or mixtures, as described<br>
in U.S. Patent No. 4,902,442, are applicable.<br>
[0065] In the separation processes of the present invention, particularly good performance has<br>
been found when preparing the modified resin using an amount of coupling agent representing<br>
from about 0.01% to about 5% of the weight of a solution or dispersion of the base resin, having<br>
a solids content from about 30% to about 90%, typically from about 45% to about 70%. In<br>
general, lower amounts of coupling agent addition do not achieve appreciable modification of<br>
the base resin, while higher amounts do not improve performance enough to justify the cost of<br>
the added coupling agent. When a mixture of coupling agents is used, the total weight of the<br>
mixture is normally within this range. An especially desired amount of added coupling agent is<br>
from about 0.1% to about 2.5% of the weight of a base resin solution or dispersion having a<br>
. solids content within the range given above.<br>
[0066] Alternatively, regardless of the solids content of the base resin solution or dispersion,<br>
the coupling agent is generally employed in an amount from about 0.01% to about 17%, and<br>
typically from about 0.1% to about 8.3%, of the weight of the base resin solids. These<br>
representative ranges of added coupling agent, based on the weight of the base resin itself, apply<br>
not only to resin solutions or dispersions, but also to "neat" forms of the modified base resin<br>
having little or no added solvent or dispersing agent (e.g., water). These ranges also generally<br>
apply when the basis is the combined weight of amine and aldehyde, as described previously,<br>
that is reacted to form the base resin. Generally, at least about 90% by weight, and typically at<br>
least about 95% by weight, of these amine and aldehyde components are reacted, in order to<br>
reduce the amounts of free, unreacted amine and aldehyde components, thereby more efficiently<br>
utilizing them in the production of the base resin polymer, and minimizing any deleterious<br>
effects (e.g., vaporization into the environment) associated with these components in their free<br>
form. As described previously, the modified resin may also be prepared by adding the coupling<br>
agent to the reaction mixture of amine and aldehyde used to form the base resin. The optimal<br>
22<br><br>
amount of coupling agent is dependent on a number of factors, including the base resin solids<br>
content, the type of base resin and the particular coupling agent, the purity of the raw ore slurry<br>
to be beneficiated or liquid suspension to be purified, etc.<br>
[0067] Modified amine-aldehyde resins for use in separation processes of the present<br>
invention generally contain from about 40% to about 100% resin solids or non-volatiles, and<br>
typically 55% to 75% non-volatiles. The non-volatiles content is measured by the weight loss<br>
upon heating a small {e.g., 1-5 gram), sample of the composition at about 105°C for about 3<br>
hours. When an essentially "neat" form of the modified resin, having few or no volatile<br>
components, is employed, the pure resin may be added (e.g., as a viscous liquid, a gel, or a solid<br>
form, such as a powder), to the froth flotation slurry or liquid dispersion to be purified, such that<br>
an aqueous resin solution or dispersion is formed in situ. Neat forms of the modified amine-<br>
aldehyde resins may be obtained from solutions or dispersions of these resins using conventional<br>
drying techniques, for example spray drying.<br>
[0068] Aqueous solutions or dispersions of the modified resins of the present invention will<br>
generally be a clear liquid or a liquid having a white or yellow appearance. They will typically<br>
have a Brookfield viscosity from about 75 to about 500 cps and a pH from about 6.5 to about<br>
9.5. The free formaldehyde content and free urea content of urea-formaldehyde resin solutions<br>
typically are each below 5%, and usually are each below 3%, and often are each below 1%. A<br>
low content of formaldehyde is generally achieved due to health concerns associated with<br>
exposure to formaldehyde emissions. If desired, conventional "formaldehyde scavengers" that<br>
are known to react with free formaldehyde may be added to reduce the level of formaldehyde in<br>
solution. Low amounts of free urea are also desirable, but for different reasons. Without being<br>
bound by theory, while free urea may itself become modified by a coupling agent (e.g., it may<br>
react with a substituted silane to improve its affinity for siliceous materials), free urea is not<br>
believed to have the requisite molecular weight, (1) in froth flotation separations, to "blind"<br>
either the gangue impurities or desired materials (e.g., kaolin clay) to their interaction with rising<br>
air bubbles, (2) in the purification of liquid dispersions, to agglomerate a sufficiently large<br>
number of solid contaminant particles into floes, or (3) in the removal of ionic species from<br>
aqueous solutions, to bind these species to a molecule of sufficient size for retention by<br>
filtration.    In particular, it has been found that resin polymers having a number average<br>
23<br><br>
molecular weight of greater than about 300 grams/mole exhibit the mass needed to promote<br>
efficient separations.<br>
Froth Flotation<br>
[0069] When used as depressants in froth flotation separations, modified resins of the present<br>
invention, due to their high selectivity, provide good results at economical addition levels. For<br>
example, when used as depressants in ore beneficiation, the modified resins are added in an<br>
amount from about 100 to about 1000 grams, and typically from about 400 to about 600 grams,<br>
based on resin solution or dispersion weight, per metric ton of material {e.g., clay-containing<br>
ore) that is to be purified by froth flotation. In general, the optimal addition amount for a<br>
particular separation can be readily ascertained by those of skill in the art and depends on<br>
number of factors, including the type and amount of impurities.<br>
[0070] Modified resins of the present invention can be applied in the froth flotation of a wide<br>
variety of value materials (e.g., minerals or metals such as phosphates, potash, lime, sulfates,<br>
gypsum, iron, platinum, gold, palladium, titanium, molybdenum, copper, uranium, chromium,<br>
tungsten, manganese, magnesium, lead, zinc, clay, coal, and silver or high molecular weight<br>
hydrocarbons such as bitumen). Often, the raw material to be purified and recovered contains<br>
sand or clay, for which the modified resin depressants described herein are especially selective<br>
[0071] Although clay is often considered an impurity in conventional metal or mineral ore<br>
beneficiation, it may also be present in relatively large quantities, as the main component to be<br>
recovered. Some clays, for example kaolin clay, are valuable minerals in a number of<br>
applications, such as mineral fillers in the manufacture of paper and rubber. Thus, one froth<br>
flotation process in which the modified resin of the present invention is employed involves the<br>
separation of clay from a clay-containing ore. The impurities in such ores are generally metals<br>
and their oxides, such as iron oxide and titanium dioxide, which are preferentially floated via<br>
froth flotation. Other impurities of clay-containing ores include coal. Impurities originally<br>
present in most Georgia kaolin, which are preferentially floated in the purification method of the<br>
present invention, include iron-bearing titania and various minerals such as mica, ilmenite, or<br>
tourmaline, which are generally also iron-containing.<br>
 [0072]   Thus, the clay, which selectively associates with the modified resin of the present<br>
invention, is separately recoverable from metals, metal oxides, and coal.  In the purification of<br>
24<br><br>
clay, it is often advantageous to employ, in conjunction with the modified resin of the present<br>
invention as a depressant, an anionic collector such as oleic acid, a flocculant such as<br>
polyacrylamide, a clay dispersant such as a fatty acid or a rosin acid, and/or oils to control<br>
frothing.<br>
[0073] Other representative froth flotation processes of the present invention involve the<br>
beneficiation of phosphate or potash, as well as other value metals and minerals discussed<br>
above, in which the removal of siliceous gangue materials and other impurities is an important<br>
factor in achieving favorable process economics. Potassium ores, for example, generally<br>
comprise a mixture of minerals in addition to sylvite (KC1), which is desirably recovered in the<br>
froth concentrate. These include halite (NaCl), clay, and carbonate minerals which are non-<br>
soluble in water, such as aluminum silicates, calcite, dolomite, and anhydrite.<br>
[0074] One approach, particularly in the refining of clay-containing ores, involves the further<br>
modification of the base resin with an anionic functional group, as described in greater detail<br>
below.<br>
[0075] The modified resin of the present invention is also advantageously employed in the<br>
separation of bitumen from sand and/or clay that are co-extracted from natural oil sand deposits.<br>
Bitumen/sand mixtures that are removed from oil or tar sands within several hundred feet of the<br>
earth's surface are generally first mixed with warm or hot water to create an aqueous slurry of<br>
the oil sand, having a reduced viscosity that facilitates its transport (e.g., by pipeline) to<br>
processing facilities. Steam and/or caustic solution may also be injected to condition the slurry<br>
for froth flotation, as well as any number of other purification steps, described below. Aeration<br>
of the bitumen-containing slurry, comprising sand or clay, results in the selective flotation of the<br>
bitumen, which allows for its recovery as a purified product. This aeration may be effected by<br>
merely agitating the slurry to release air bubbles and/or introducing a source of air into the<br>
bottom of the separation cell. The optimal amount of air needed to float the desired bitumen,<br>
without entraining excessive solid contaminants, is readily determined by one of ordinary skill<br>
in the art.<br>
[0076] Thus, the use of the modified resin depressant of the present invention advantageously<br>
promotes the retention of the sand and/or clay impurities in an aqueous fraction, which is<br>
removed from the bottom section of the froth flotation vessel. This bottoms fraction is enriched<br>
(i.e., has a higher concentration of) the sand and/or clay impurities, relative to the initial bitumen<br>
25<br><br>
slurry. The overall purification of bitumen may rely on two or more stages of flotation<br>
separation. For example, the middle section of a primary flotation separation vessel may contain<br>
a significant amount of bitumen that can ultimately be recovered in a secondary flotation of this<br>
"middlings" fraction.<br>
[0077] Generally, in any froth flotation process according to the present invention, at least<br>
70% of the value material (e.g., kaolin clay, phosphate, or bitumen) is recovered from the raw<br>
material (e.g., the clay-containing ore), with a purity of at least 85% by weight. Also,<br>
conventional known collectors may be used in conjunction with modified resins of the present<br>
invention, when used as depressants. These collectors include, for example, fatty acids (e.g.,<br>
oleic acid, sodium oleate, hydrocarbon oils), amines (e.g., dodecylamine, octadecylamine, a-<br>
aminoarylphosphonic acid, and sodium sarcosinate), and xanthanate. Likewise, conventional<br>
depressants known in the art can also be combined with the modified resin depressants.<br>
Conventional depressants include guar gum and other hydrocolloidal polysaccharides, sodium<br>
hexametaphosphate, etc. Conventional frothing agents that aid collection, (e.g.,<br>
methylisobutylcarbinol, pine oil, and polypropylene oxides) may also be used, in accordance<br>
with normal flotation practice, in conjunction with the modified resin depressants of the present<br>
invention.<br>
[0078] In froth flotation separations, the pH of the slurry to which the modified resins of the<br>
present invention, when used as depressants, are added will vary according to the particular<br>
material to be processed, as is appreciated by those skilled in the art. Commonly, the pH values<br>
range from neutral (pH 7) to strongly alkaline (e.g., pH 12). It is recognized that in some<br>
flotation systems, for example in copper sulfide flotations, high pH values (e.g., from about 8 to<br>
about 12.5) give best results.<br>
[0079] Typically in froth flotation for the beneficiation of solid materials such as mineral or<br>
metal ores, the raw materials to be subjected to beneficiation are usually first ground to the<br>
"liberation mesh" size where most of the value material-containing particles are either separate<br>
mineral or metal particles or salt crystals, and the gangue (e.g., clay and/or sand) is mixed<br>
between these particles. The solid material may be ground to produce, for example, one-eighth<br>
inch average diameter particles prior to incorporation of the material into a brine solution to<br>
yield an aqueous slurry. After crushing and slurrying the material, the slurry may be agitated or<br>
stirred in a "scrubbing" process that breaks down clay into very fine particles that remain in the<br>
26<br><br>
brine as a muddy suspension. Some of this clay may be washed off the ore particles, into a clay-<br>
containing aqueous suspension or brine, prior to froth flotation. Also, as is known in the art, any<br>
conventional preconditioning steps including further crushing/screening, cycloning, and/or<br>
hydro separation steps, may be employed, respectively, to further reduce/classify raw material<br>
particle size, remove clay-containing brine, and/or recover smaller solid particles from the<br>
muddy brine, prior to froth flotation.<br>
[0080] Before or during froth flotation, the modified resin of the present invention, to be used<br>
as a depressant, is added to the aqueous slurry, normally in a manner such that the depressant is<br>
readily dispersed throughout. As stated above, conventional collectors may also be used to aid<br>
in the flotation of the desired value materials. In the froth flotation process, the slurry, typically<br>
having a solids content from about 10 to about 50% by weight, is transferred to one or more<br>
froth flotation cells. Air is forced through the bottoms of these cells and a relatively<br>
hydrophobic fraction of the material, having a selective affinity for the rising bubbles, floats to<br>
the surface (i.e., the froth), where it is skimmed off and recovered. A bottoms product that is<br>
hydrophilic relative to the froth concentrate may also be recovered. The process may be<br>
accompanied by agitation. Commercially salable products can be prepared from the separate<br>
fractions recovered in this manner, often after further conventional steps, including separation<br>
(e.g., by centrifuge), drying (e.g., in a gas fired kiln), size classification (e.g., screening), and<br>
refining (e.g., crystallization), are employed.<br>
[0081] The froth flotation of the present invention may, though not always, involve flotation<br>
in "rougher cells" followed by one or more "cleanings" of the rougher concentrate. Two or<br>
more flotation steps may also be employed to first recover a bulk value material comprising<br>
more than one component, followed by a selective flotation to separate these components.<br>
Modified resins of the present invention, when used as depressants, can be used to advantage in<br>
any of these steps to improve the selective recovery of desired materials via froth flotation.<br>
When multiple stages of froth flotation are used, the modified resins may be added using a<br>
single addition prior to multiple flotations or they may be added separately at each flotation<br>
stage.<br>
Other Separations<br>
[0082] Because of their affinity for solid contaminants in liquid suspensions, the modified<br>
resins of the present invention are applicable in a wide variety of separations, and especially<br>
27<br><br>
those involving the removal of siliceous contaminants such as sand and/or clay from aqueous<br>
liquid suspensions or slurries of these contaminants. Such aqueous suspensions or slurries may<br>
therefore be treated with modified resins of the present invention, allowing for the separation of<br>
at least a portion of the contaminants, in a contaminant-rich fraction, from a purified liquid. A<br>
"contaminant-rich" fraction refers to a part of the liquid suspension or slurry that is enriched in<br>
solid contaminants (i.e., contains a higher percentage of solid contaminants than originally<br>
present in the liquid suspension or slurry). Conversely, the purified liquid has a lower<br>
percentage of solid contaminants than originally present in the liquid suspension or slurry.<br>
[0083] The separation processes described herein are applicable to "suspensions" as well as to<br>
"slurries" of solid particles. These terms are sometimes defined equivalently and sometimes are<br>
distinguished based on the need for the input of at least some agitation or energy to maintain<br>
homogeneity in the case of a "slurry." Because the methods of the present invention, described<br>
herein, are applicable broadly to the separation of solid particles from aqueous media, the term<br>
"suspension" is interchangeable with "slurry" (and vice versa) in the present specification and<br>
appended claims.<br>
[0084] The treatment step may involve adding a sufficient amount of the modified resin to<br>
electronically interact with and either coagulate or flocculate the solid contaminants into larger<br>
agglomerates. The necessary amount can be readily determined depending on a number of<br>
variables (e.g., the type and concentration of contaminant), as is readily appreciated by those<br>
having skill in the art. In other embodiments, the treatment may involve contacting the liquid<br>
suspension continuously with a fixed bed of the modified resin, in solid form.<br>
[0085] During or after the treatment of a liquid suspension with the modified resin, the<br>
coagulated or flocculated solid contaminant (which may now be, for example, in the form of<br>
larger, agglomerated particles or floes) is removed. Removal may be effected by flotation (with<br>
or without the use of rising air bubbles as described previously with respect to froth flotation) or<br>
sedimentation. The optimal approach for removal will depend on the relative density of the<br>
floes and other factors. Increasing the quantity of modified resin that is used to treat the<br>
suspension can in some cases increase the tendency of the floes to float rather than settle.<br>
Filtration or straining may also be an effective means of removing the agglomerated floes of<br>
solid particulates, regardless of whether they reside in a surface layer or in a sediment.<br>
28<br><br>
[0086] Examples of liquid suspensions that may be purified according to the present invention<br>
include oil and gas well drilling fluids, which accumulate solid particles of rock (or drill<br>
cuttings) in the normal course of their use. These drilling fluids (often referred to as "drilling<br>
muds") are important in the drilling process for several reasons, including transporting these<br>
drill cuttings from the drilling area to the surface, where their removal allows the drilling mud to<br>
be recirculated. The addition of modified resins of the present invention to oil well drilling<br>
fluids, and especially water-based (i.e., aqueous) drilling fluids, effectively coagulates or<br>
flocculates solid particle contaminants into larger clumps (or floes), thereby facilitating their<br>
separation by settling or flotation. The modified resins of the present invention may be used in<br>
conjunction with known flocculants for this application such as polyacrylamides or<br>
hydrocolloidal polysaccharides. Generally, in the case of suspensions of water-based oil or gas<br>
well drilling fluids, the separation of the solid contaminants is sufficient to provide a purified<br>
drilling fluid for reuse in drilling operations.<br>
[0087] Other aqueous suspensions of practical interest include the clay-containing aqueous<br>
suspensions or brines, which accompany ore refinement processes, including those described<br>
above. The production of purified phosphate from mined calcium phosphate rock, for example,<br>
generally relies on multiple separations of solid particulates from aqueous media, whereby such<br>
separations can be improved using the modified resin of the present invention. In the overall<br>
process, calcium phosphate is mined from deposits at an average depth of about 25 feet below<br>
ground level. The phosphate rock is initially recovered in a matrix containing sand and clay<br>
impurities. The matrix is first mixed with water to form a slurry, which, typically after<br>
mechanical agitation, is screened to retain phosphate pebbles and to allow fine clay particles to<br>
pass through as a clay slurry effluent with large amounts of water.<br>
[0088] These clay-containing effluents generally have high flow rates and typically carry less<br>
than 10% solids by weight and more often contain only from about 1% to about 5% solids by<br>
weight. The dewatering (e.g., by settling or filtration) of this waste clay, which allows for<br>
recycle of the water, poses a significant challenge for reclamation. The time required to dewater<br>
the clay, however, can be decreased through treatment of the clay slurry effluent, obtained in the<br>
production of phosphate, with the modified resin of the present invention. Reduction in the clay<br>
settling time allows for efficient re-use of the purified water, obtained from clay dewatering, in<br>
the phosphate production operation. In one embodiment of the purification method, wherein the<br>
29<br><br>
liquid suspension is a clay-containing effluent slurry from a phosphate production facility, the<br>
purified liquid contains less than about 1% solids by weight after a settling or dewatering time of<br>
less than about 1 month.<br>
[0089] In addition to the phosphate pebbles that are retained by screening and the clay slurry<br>
effluent described above, a mixture of sand and finer particles of phosphate is also obtained in<br>
the initial processing of the mined phosphate matrix. The sand and phosphate in this stream are<br>
separated by froth flotation which, as described earlier, can be improved using the modified<br>
resin of-ihe present invention as a depressant for the sand.<br>
[0090] In the area of slurry dewatering, another specific application of the modified resin is in<br>
the filtration of coal from water-containing slurries. The dewatering of coal is important<br>
commercially, since the BTU value and hence the quality of the coal decreases with increasing<br>
water content. In one embodiment of the invention, therefore, the modified resin is used to treat<br>
an aqueous coal-containing suspension or slurry prior to dewatering the coal by filtration.<br>
[0091] Another significant application of the modified resin of the present invention is in the<br>
area of sewage treatment, which refers to various processes that are undertaken to remove<br>
contaminants from industrial and municipal waste water. Such processes thereby purify sewage<br>
to provide both purified water that is suitable for disposal into the environment {e.g., rivers,<br>
streams, and oceans) as well as a sludge. Sewage refers to any type of water-containing wastes<br>
which are normally collected in sewer systems and conveyed to treatment facilities. Sewage<br>
therefore includes municipal wastes from toilets (sometimes referred to as "foul waste") and<br>
basins, baths, showers, and kitchens (sometimes referred to as "sullage water"). Sewage also<br>
includes industrial and commercial waste water, (sometimes referred to as "trade waste"), as<br>
well as stormwater runoff from hard-standing areas such as roofs and streets.<br>
[0092] The conventional treatment of sewage often involves preliminary, primary, and<br>
secondary treatment steps. Preliminary treatment refers to the filtration or screening of large<br>
solids such as wood, paper, rags, etc., as well as coarse sand and grit, which would normally<br>
damage pumps. The subsequent primary treatment is then employed to separate most of the<br>
remaining solids by settling in large tanks, where a solids-rich sludge is recovered from the<br>
bottom of these tanks and treated further. A purified water is also recovered and normally<br>
subjected to secondary treatment by biological processes.<br>
30<br><br>
[0093] Thus, in one embodiment of the present invention, the settling or sedimentation of<br>
sewage water may comprise treating the sewage with the modified resin of the present invention.<br>
This treatment may be used to improve settling operation (either batch or continuous), for<br>
example, by decreasing the residence time required to effect a given separation (e.g., based on<br>
the purity of the purified water and/or the percent recovery of solids in the sludge). Otherwise,<br>
the improvement may be manifested in the generation of a higher purity of the purified water<br>
and/or a higher recovery of solids in the sludge, for a given settling time.<br>
[0094] - After treatment of sewage with the modified resin of the present invention and<br>
removing a purified water stream by sedimentation, it is also possible for the modified resin to<br>
be subsequently used for, or introduced into, secondary treatment processes to further purify the<br>
water. Secondary treatment normally relies on the action of naturally occurring microorganisms<br>
to break down organic material. In particular, aerobic biological processes substantially degrade<br>
the biological content of the purified water recovered from primary treatment. The<br>
microorganisms (e.g., bacteria and protozoa) consume biodegradable soluble organic<br>
contaminants (e.g., sugars, fats, and other organic molecules) and bind much of the less soluble<br>
fractions into floes, thereby further facilitating the removal of organic material.<br>
[0095] Secondary treatment relies on "feeding" the aerobic microorganisms oxygen and other<br>
nutrients which allow them to survive and consume organic contaminants. Advantageously, the<br>
modified resin of the present invention, which contains nitrogen, can serve as a "food" source<br>
for microorganisms involved in secondary treatment, as well as potentially an additional<br>
flocculant for organic materials. In one embodiment of the invention, therefore, the sewage<br>
purification method further comprises, after removing purified water (in the primary treatment<br>
step) by sedimentation, further treating the purified water in the presence of microorganisms and<br>
the modified resin, and optionally with an additional amount of modified resin, to reduce the<br>
biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) of the purified water. As is understood in the art, the BOD<br>
is an important measure of water quality and represents the oxygen needed, in mg/1 (or ppm by<br>
weight) by microorganisms to oxidize organic impurities over 5 days. The BOD of the purified<br>
water after treatment with microorganisms and the modified resin, is generally less than 10 ppm,<br>
typically less than 5 ppm, and often less than 1 ppm.<br>
[0096] The modified resin of the present invention may also be applied to the purification of<br>
pulp and paper mill  effluents.     These aqueous waste streams normally contain solid<br>
31<br><br>
contaminants in the form of cellulosic materials (e.g., waste paper; bark or other wood elements,<br>
such as wood flakes, wood strands, wood fibers, or wood particles; or plant fibers such as wheat<br>
straw fibers, rice fibers, switchgrass fibers, soybean stalk fibers, bagasse fibers, or cornstalk<br>
fibers; and mixtures of these contaminants). In accordance with the method of the present<br>
invention, the effluent stream comprising a cellulosic solid contaminant is treated with the<br>
modified resin of the present invention, such that purified water may be removed via<br>
sedimentation, flotation, or filtration.<br>
[0097] In the separation of bitumen from sand and/or clay impurities as described previously,<br>
various separation steps may be employed either before or after froth flotation of the bitumen-<br>
containing slurry. These steps can include screening, filtration, and sedimentation, any of which<br>
may benefit from treatment of the oil sand slurry with the modified resin of the present<br>
invention, followed by removal of a portion of the sand and/or clay contaminants in a<br>
contaminant-rich fraction {e.g., a bottoms fraction) or by removal of a purified bitumen fraction.<br>
As described above with respect to phosphate ore processing water effluents, which generally<br>
contain solid clay particles, the treating step can comprise flocculating these contaminants to<br>
facilitate their removal {e.g., by filtration). Waste water effluents from bitumen processing<br>
facilities will likewise contain sand and/or clay impurities and therefore benefit from treatment<br>
with the modified resin of the present invention to dewater them and/or remove at least a portion<br>
of these solid impurities in a contaminant-rich faction. A particular process stream of interest<br>
that is generated during bitumen extraction is known as the "mature fine tails," which is an<br>
aqueous suspension of fine solid particulates that can benefit from dewatering. Generally, in the<br>
case of sand and/or clay containing suspensions from a bitumen production facility, separation<br>
of the solid contaminants is sufficient to allow the recovery or removal of a purified liquid or<br>
water stream that can be recycled to the bitumen process.<br>
[0098] The treatment of various intermediate streams and effluents in bitumen production<br>
processes with the modified resin of the present invention is not limited only to those processes<br>
that rely at least partly on froth flotation of an aqueous bitumen-containing slurry. As is readily<br>
appreciated by those of skill in the art, other techniques (e.g., centrifugation via the "Syncrude<br>
Process") for bitumen purification will generate aqueous intermediate and byproduct streams<br>
from which solid contaminant removal is desirable.<br>
32<br><br>
[0099] The modified resins of the present invention can be employed in the removal of<br>
suspended solid particulates, such as sand and clay, in the purification of water, and particularly<br>
for the purpose of rendering it potable.<br>
[00100] Moreover, modified resins of the present invention have the additional ability to<br>
complex metallic cations (e.g., lead and mercury cations) allowing these unwanted contaminants<br>
to be removed in conjunction with solid particulates. Therefore, modified resins of the present<br>
invention can be used to effectively treat impure water having both solid particulate<br>
contaminants as well as metallic cation contaminants. Without being bound by theory, it is<br>
believed that electronegative moieties, such as the carbonyl oxygen atom on the urea-<br>
formaldehyde resin polymer backbone, complex with undesired cations to facilitate their<br>
removal. Generally, this complexation occurs at a pH of the water that is greater than about 5<br>
and typically in the range from about 7 to about 9.<br>
[00101] Another possible mechanism for the removal of metallic cations is based on their<br>
association with negatively charged solid particulates. Flocculation and removal of these<br>
particulates will therefore also cause, at least to some extent, the removal of metallic cations.<br>
Regardless of the mechanism, in one embodiment, the treatment and removal of both of these<br>
contaminants can be carried out according to the present invention to yield potable water.<br>
[00102] The removal of metallic cations may represent the predominant or even the sole<br>
means of water purification that is effected by the modified resin, for example when the water to<br>
be purified contains little or no solid particulates. Solid forms of the modified resin may be used<br>
to remove cations in a continuous process whereby the impure water containing metallic cations<br>
is continuously passed through a fixed bed of the resin. Alternatively, soluble forms of the<br>
modified resin, generally having a lower molecular weight, may be added to the impure water in<br>
order to treat it. The complexed cations in this case can be removed, for example, by<br>
ultrafiltration through a porous membrane (e.g., polysulfone) having a molecular weight cutoff<br>
that is less than the molecular weight of the modified resin. The water purification methods<br>
described herein may also be used in conjunction with known methods including reverse<br>
osmosis, UV irradiation, etc.<br>
[00103] To increase the effectiveness of the modified resins in complexing with metallic<br>
cations, it may be desirable to further modify the base resin as described above with one or more<br>
anionic functional groups. Such modifications are known in the art and can involve the reaction<br>
33<br><br>
of the base resin or modified resin to incorporate the desired functional group (e.g., by<br>
sulfonation with sodium metabisulfite). Alternatively, the further modification is achieved<br>
during preparation of the base resin (e.g., during condensation) by incorporating an anionic co-<br>
monomer, such as sodium acrylate, either into the base resin or into the coupling agent. For<br>
example, as described above, organopolysiloxane derivatives used as coupling agents may be<br>
prepared by incorporating further organic resin. functionalities, such as acrylate, into the<br>
coupling agent. Representative additional functionalities with which the base resin or modified<br>
resin, including a urea-formaldehyde resin, may be modified include the anionic functional<br>
groups bisulfite, acrylate, acetate, carbonate, azide, amide, etc. Procedures for modifying the<br>
base resin with additional functionalities are known to those having skill in the art. The<br>
incorporation of anionic functional groups into the base resin may also be employed in<br>
separations involving the purification of slurries containing solid clay particles (e.g., by froth<br>
flotation, flocculation, etc), including those described above, such as in the purification of<br>
kaolin clay ore. Without being bound by theory, sulfonation of the base resin or the<br>
incorporation of other anionic functional groups can also increase hydrogen bonding between<br>
the base resin and the surrounding aqueous phase to inhibit condensation of the base resin or<br>
otherwise improve its stability.<br>
[00104] As described above, therefore, the present invention, in one embodiment, is a method<br>
for purifying water containing a metallic cation by treating the water with a modified resin as<br>
described herein and which may be further modified with an anionic group. Removal of at least<br>
a portion of the metallic cations may be effected by retaining them on a fixed bed of the<br>
modified resin or otherwise by filtering them out. In the latter case, removal by filtration such as<br>
membrane filtration is made possible by the'association of the metallic cations either directly<br>
with the modified resin or indirectly with the modified resin via solid particulates, for which the<br>
modified resin has affinity. In the case of indirect association, as described earlier, flocculation<br>
of the solid particulates will also necessarily agglomerate at least a portion of the metallic<br>
cations, which may therefore be removed by flotation or sedimentation of these particulates.<br>
[00105] The modified resin of the present invention is therefore, advantageously used to treat<br>
water for the removal of metallic cations such as arsenic, lead, cadmium, copper, and mercury<br>
that are known to pose health risks when ingested. These cations thus include As+5, Pb+2, Cd+2,<br>
Cu+2, Hg+2, and mixtures thereof.   Generally, a degree of removal is effected such that the<br>
34<br><br>
purified water, after treatment, is essentially free of one or more of the above metallic cations.<br>
By "essentially free" is meant that the concentration(s) of one or more metallic cation(s) of<br>
interest is/are reduced to concentration(s) at or below those considered safe (e.g., by a regulatory<br>
agency such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency). Therefore, in various representative<br>
embodiments, the purified water will contain at most about 10 ppb of As+5, at most about 15 ppb<br>
of Pb+2, at most about 5 ppb of Cd+2, at most about 1.3 ppm of Cu+2, and/or at most about 2 ppb<br>
of Hg+2. That is, generally at least one, typically at least two, and often all, of the above-<br>
mentioned cations are at or below these threshold concentration levels in the purified water.<br>
[00106] In any of the applications described herein, it is possible to stabilize the modified<br>
resin of the present invention by reaction with an alcohol (i.e., etherification). Without being<br>
bound by theory, it is believed that etherification of pendant alkylol functionalities can inhibit<br>
further condensation of the base resin (e.g., condensation of a urea-formaldehyde resin with<br>
itself). This can ultimately hinder or prevent the precipitation of the base resin during long term<br>
storage, such that, relative to their corresponding non-etherified resins, the etherified resins can<br>
have increased molecular weight without an accompanying loss in stability<br>
[00107] Etherification thus involves reacting the amine-aldehyde adducts or condensates, or<br>
even the modified resins, as described above, with an alcohol. In one embodiment, a urea-<br>
formaldehyde base resin is etherified with an alcohol having from 1 to 8 carbon atoms, prior its<br>
modification with a coupling agent. Representative alcohols for use in the etherification include<br>
methanol (e.g., to effect methylation), ethanol, n-propanol, isopropanol, n-butanol, and<br>
isobutanol. In exemplary preparations of etherified base resins, the amine-aldehyde adduct or<br>
condensate reaction product is heated to a temperature from about 70°C to about 120°C in the<br>
presence of an alcohol until the etherification is complete. An acid such as sulfuric acid,<br>
phosphoric acid, formic acid, acetic acid, nitric acid, alum, iron chloride, and other acids may be<br>
added before or during the reaction with alcohol. Often, sulfuric acid or phosphoric acid is<br>
employed.<br>

EXAMPLE 1<br>
[00111] Various urea-formaldehyde resins were prepared as low molecular weight condensate<br>
resins, initially under alkaline conditions to form methylolated urea adducts, and then under<br>
acidic conditions to form the condensate. The condensation reaction was stopped by raising the<br>
pH of the condensation reaction mixture. Other preparation conditions were as described above.<br>
These base resins are identified in Table 1 below with respect to their molecular weight (Mol.<br>
Wt.) in grams/mole and their approximate normalized weight percentages of free urea, cyclic<br>
urea species (cyclic urea), mono-methylolated urea (Mono), and combined di-/tri-methylolated<br>
urea (Di/Tri). In each case, the base resins were in a solution having a resin solids content of 45-<br>
70%, a viscosity of 500 cps or less, and a free formaldehyde content of less than 5% by weight.<br>

* Resin B is a very stable urea-formaldehyde resin, having a high cyclic urea content. This<br>
resin is described in U.S. Patent No. 6,114,491.<br>
** Resin C was formed by adding, in addition to Silane #1 (described below), 2% by weight of<br>
diethylenetriamine and 2% by weight dicyandiamide to the mixture of urea and<br>
formaldehyde during resin preparation.<br>
***Resin D' was formed by adding 0.75% by weight cyclic phosphate ester to the mixture of<br>
urea and formaldehyde during resin preparation. The resin was a low molecular weight<br>
formulation with a high content of free urea, essentially no free formaldehyde, and a high<br>
content of non-volatiles (about 70% solids).<br>

phenol, and bisphenol-A calibration standards.<br>
[00112] The urea-formaldehyde resin solutions described above were modified by silane<br>
coupling agents, in order to prepare resin depressants of the present invention. Silane coupling<br>
agents #1, #2, and #3, all substituted silanes as identified in Table 2 below, were used in these<br>
modified resin preparations.<br>

EXAMPLE 2<br>
[00113] The above urea-formaldehyde base resins described in Table 1 were modified by the<br>
silane coupling agents #1, #2, and #3, as described in Table 2, according to procedures described<br>
previously. Namely, the silane coupling agent was added to the base resin solution in an amount<br>
of about 0.1-2.5% based on the weight of the resin solution, after formation of a low molecular<br>
weight condensate and the subsequent addition of a base to increase the solution pH and halt the<br>
condensation reactions, as described above. The alkaline mixture of the base resin and silane<br>
coupling agent was then heated to a temperature of about 35-45°C for about 0.5-4 hours, until a<br>
viscosity of about 350-450 cps was achieved.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
[00114] Various urea-formaldehyde resin samples, representing both un-modified resins or<br>
resins modified with silane coupling agents as noted above, along with a control depressant,<br>
were tested for their selectivity in removing siliceous sand and clay impurities from potash ore<br>
by froth flotation, in a laboratory-scale beneficiation study. In each test, the amount of<br>
depressant employed per unit weight of ore to be beneficiated, the solids content of the ore<br>
slurry, the pH of the slurry, the volumetric air flow rate per unit volume of the slurry, the<br>
phosphate purity of the ore prior to beneficiation, and other conditions were representative of a<br>
commercial operation. In each test, the ore recovered by flotation was at least 90% by weight<br>
pure phosphate material. A commercially available guar gum was used as a depressant control<br>
sample.<br>
[00115] In these experiments, the performance of each depressant was measured based on the<br>
quantity of potash that could be recovered (i.e., floated) at a specified purity. This quantity<br>
provided the measure of each depressant's selectively in binding to unwanted gangue materials.<br>
In other words, the higher the selectivity of a depressant, the greater the quantity of 90% pure<br>
phosphate that could be floated. The following data was obtained, as shown in Table 3 below.<br>

[00116] Based on the above results, the use of a silane coupling agent to modify a urea-<br>
formaldehyde base resin, preferably via a covalent link, can dramatically improve the resin<br>
performance as a depressant in froth flotation. Also, the performance advantage associated with<br>
the use of a silane coupling agent becomes more evident as the molecular weight of the base<br>
resin is increased. Especially good performance is obtained for base resins having a molecular<br>
39<br><br>
weight above about 300 grams/mole, before modification. This is illustrated in Figure 1,<br>
showing the performance of silane coupling agent-modified resins compared to unmodified<br>
resins, for resins having a molecular weight from about 400 to about 1200 grams/mole.<br>
Moreover, the performance of urea-formaldehyde resins within this molecular weight range is<br>
not appreciably affected by the use of additional resin modifiers (e.g., diethylenetriamine,<br>
dicyandiamide, phosphate esters, etc.) of the base resin.<br>
[00117] Figure 1 also illustrates that silane coupling agent-modified resins having a molecular<br>
weight from about 400 to about 1200 grams/mole perform superior to their unmodified<br>
counterpart and generally perform superior to guar gum, which is known in the art to bind clay<br>
and talc, but is considerably more expensive. Furthermore, in contrast to guar gum, the<br>
depressants of the present invention showed substantially higher selectivity for the flotation of<br>
coarse phosphate particles. The comparatively greater amount of fines material in the purified<br>
phosphate that was floated in the test with guar gum would add significantly to the expense<br>
associated with downstream drying and screening operations to yield a salable product.<br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
[00118] A sample of a modified resin depressant of the present invention was tested for its<br>
performance in a potash beneficiation plant, relative to guar gum, which is currently employed at<br>
the plant as a commercial depressant of gangue materials. The depressant of the present<br>
invention used for this test was Resin F, Modified by Silane #2, as described in Examples 1-3<br>
above.<br>
[00119] For the comparative tests, the amount of depressant employed per unit weight of ore<br>
to be beneficiated, the solids content of the ore slurry, the pH of the slurry, the volumetric air<br>
flow rate per unit volume of the slurry, the potassium mineral purity of the ore prior to<br>
beneficiation, and other conditions were representative of a commercial operation. The<br>
performance of each depressant was measured based on the quantity of phosphate that could be<br>
recovered (i.e., floated) at a specified purity. This quantity provided the measure of each<br>
depressant's selectively in binding to unwanted gangue materials. In other words, the higher the<br>
selectivity of a depressant, the greater the quantity of potash that could be floated at a specified<br>
purity.<br>
40<br><br>
[00120] Relative to guar gum, the depressant of the present invention provided an increase in<br>
the yield of purified potash of about 19%. Furthermore, the yield of coarse particles of the<br>
desired potash (potassium chloride) mineral was substantially higher using the urea-<br>
formaldehyde resin, modified with a silane coupling agent. For the reasons explained above,<br>
this improvement in the yield of coarse material reduces costs associated with drier energy<br>
requirements and other downstream operations, as well as the overall processing time needed for<br>
further refinement, prior to sale.<br>
EXAMPLE 5<br>
[00121] A urea-formaldehyde (UF) resin, modified with a silane coupling agent as described<br>
above, was tested for its ability to reduce the dewatering time, by filtration, of various solid<br>
contaminants suspended in aqueous slurries. In each experiment, a 25 gram sample of solid<br>
contaminant was uniformly slurried with 100 grams of 0.01 molar KNO3. The pH of the slurry<br>
was measured. The slurry was then subjected to vacuum filtration using a standard 12.7 cm<br>
diameter Buchner funnel apparatus and 11.0 cm diameter Whatman qualitative #1 filter paper.<br>
The dewatering time in each case was the time required to recover 100 ml of filtrate through the<br>
filter paper.<br>
[00122] For each solid contaminant tested, a control experiment as run, followed by an<br>
identical experiment, differing only in (1) the addition of 0.5-1 grams of silane modified UF<br>
resin to the slurry and (2) mixing of the slurry for one additional minute, after a uniform slurry<br>
was obtained upon stirring. Results are shown below in Table 4.<br>

Modified resins are disclosed for removing a wide variety of solids and/or ionic species from the<br>
liquids in which they are suspended and/or dissolved. These modified resins are especially useful<br>
as froth flotation depressants in the beneficiation of many types of materials (e.g., mineral and<br>
metal ores), including the beneficiation of impure coal comprising clay impurities, as well as in<br>
the separation of valuable bitumen from solid contaminants such as sand. The modified resins<br>
are also useful for treating aqueous liquid suspensions to remove solid particulates, as well as for<br>
removing metallic ions in the purification of water. The modified resins comprise a base resin<br>
that is modified with a coupling agent, which is highly selective for binding to solid<br>
contaminants and especially siliceous materials such as sand or clay.</td>
