				<td>Process for the manufacture of epoxy treasure derivatives<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the manufacture of (2R,3R)-3-(haiogenophenyI)-3,4-epoxy-2-butanol derivatives which are useful in the synthesis of azole antifungal compounds like e.g. (1R,2R)-4-[2-[2-(2,4-Difluoro-phenyl)-2-hydroxy-1-methyl-3-[12 4]triazol-1-yl-propyl]-thiazol-4-yl]-benzonitrileor, in particular, (1R,2R)-4-[2-[2-(2,5-Difluoro-phenyl)-2-hydroxy-1-methyl-3-I1,2,4]triazol-1-yl-propyl]-thiazol-4-yl]-benzonitrile (BAL 4815) and to a process for manufacturing such azole antifungal compounds using the aforementioned process.<br>
Processes for the preparation of (2R,3R)-3-(halogenophenyl)-3,4-epoxy-2-butanol derivatives are known in the art. The known processes usually start from the rather costly R-lactic acid or D-(-)-lactic acid. For example, US 2003/0236419 A1 discloses a process for manufacturing (2R,3R)-3-(2',4'-difluorophenyl)-3,4-epoxy-2-butano! wherein D-methyl lactate is converted to (2R)- 2',4'-difluoro-2-hydroxy-propiophenone, which is then reacted with trimethyloxosulfonium bromide/sodium hydride to give a 12:1-mixture of (2R,3R)-3-(2',4'-difluorophenyl)-3,4-epoxy-2-butanol and the corresponding (2R,3S)-compound. A similar reaction is described in WO99/45008 for manufacturing (2R,3R)-3-(2',5'-difluorophenyl)-3,4-epoxy-2-butanol.<br>
WO 9952840 A1, on the other side, discloses the use of the much less expensive S-iactic acid (L-(+)-lactic acid) instead of R-lactic acid as the basic starting material for (2R,3R)-3-(2',4'-dihalogenophenyl)-3,4-epoxy-2-butanol derivatives. It is, however, necessary to change the configuration of carbon atom 2 of the butanol ■ skeleton in course of said process in order to arrive at the desired R-conflguration at said carbon atom. This is achieved according to WO 9952840 A1 via the well-known Mitsunobu Reaction, wherein the intermediate (2S,3R)-3-(2',4'-dihalogenophenyl)-3,4-epoxy-2-butanolderivative is reacted with p-nitrobenzoic<br><br>
acid in the presence of triphenylphosphine and diethylazodicarboxyiate (DEAD) to give (2R,3R)-3-(2',4'-dihalogenophenyl)-3,4-epoxy-2-butanol p-nitrobenzoic acid ester; v/hich is then saponified to the corresponding butanol derivative.<br>
Said  itsunobu Reaction step however has several disadvantages, in particular if is to be applied on a technical scale. It provides only unsatisfactory yields of the desired (2R,3R) derivative, produces an unacceptable quantity of waste, and said process step is only difficult up-scalable, if at all, because substantial problems with the purification of the product arise at a larger scale.<br>
In particular, if the classical Mitsunobu conditions, disclosed in WO 9952840 A1 in connection with the manufacture of (2R,3R)-3-(2',4'-dlfluorophenyl)-3,4-epoxy-2-butanol, is applied to the respective 2',5'-difluoro analog, an unsatifactory yield of only about 50% can be obtained. Moreover, the enantiomeric excess observed is only about 90%, hence no full conversion reversal is achieved.<br>
It has now been found, however, that using instead a specific alternative of the Mitsunobo step in the manufacture of (2R,3R)-3-(haIogenophenyl)-3,4-epoxy-2-butanol provides much better yields, and has not the disadvantages associated with said reaction step.<br>
A first subject of the present invention is therefore a process for the preparation of a compound of formula (I)<br><br>
(I) wherein<br>
Hal represents fluoro or chloro, and<br>
R' and R^ represent, independently from one another, hydrogen or have one of the meanings of Hal;<br><br>
in which process a compound of formula (il)<br><br>
(II) is converted to a corresponding alkyl, fluoroalkyl or aryl sulfonic acid ester,<br>
which is then reacted with an alkali metal nitrite in a polar non-nucleophilic<br>
solvent at a temperature of minus 10°C to SO^C and in the presence of a<br>
suitable crown ester, to give the compound of formula ([),<br>
Suitable alkyl or aryl sulfonic acid esters include for example p-toluene sulfonic acid ester, methyl sulfonic acid ester and in particular trifluoromethyl sulfonic acid ester. The conversion of the compound of formula (II) to the corresponding alkyl or aryl sulfonic acid esters can be accomplished in a way known perse, e.g. by reacting the compound of formula (II) with an alkyl or aryl sulfonic acid halide, e.g. the chloride, or preferably the anhydride in the presence of a base like e.g. pyridine, preferably at temperatures between minus 10°C and 50°C, more preferably between minus 10°C and 10°C, e.g. at 0°C, in a non-polar solvent like e.g. methylene chloride.

The base, e.g. pyridine, is used in about the same quantities as the alkyl or aryl sulfonic acid derivative. Suitable reaction times range from about 15 minutes to several hours, e.g. 10 hours, preferably from 1 to 3 hours.<br>
After optional purification of the reaction product and/or removal of the solvent, the alkyl, fluoroalkyl or aryl sulfonic acid ester of the compound of formula (11) is dissolved in a polar non-nucleophilic solvent like, for example, dlmethylsulfoxide (DMSO), N,N-dimethylformamide(DI\/IF), 1,3-dimethy!-<br><br>
3,4,5,6-tetrahydro-2(1H)-pyrimidinone (DMPU), tetrahydrofurane (THF), dioxane or formamide, and is reacted with an excess of an all<ali metal nitrite e.g. sodium potassium or caesium in the presence of a suitable crown ether as catalyst.></ali>
Preferably a two- to tenfold excess of the alkali metal nitrite is used, more preferably a four- to sixfold excess. Suitable crown ethers can be readily chosen by those skilled in the art, mainly depending on what alkali metal nitrite is applied, and include 18-crown-6-ether, 15-crown-5-ether. 12-crown-4 ether. 18-crown-6-ether is specifically preferred, in particular when used with potassium nitrite. As mentioned, it is used in catalytical amounts, e.g. in an amount ranging from a thousandth to a tenth part of the molar quantity of the alkali metal nitrite. The reaction is preferably carried out at about 10 to 30°C, more preferably at about 15 to 25°C, e.g. at room temperature,<br>

The solvents used include e.g. ethyl acetate, linear or branched Cs-s alkanes, methyl acetate, ethyl acetate which is especially preferred, propyl acetate, and symmetric or asymmetric dialkyi ethers, the alkyl groups of which comprise from 1 to 5 carbon atoms. After extraction and appropriate washing (brine) the compound (1) can be used as is, directly without further purification required.<br>

A further preferred embodiment is a process of the present invention for manufacturing compounds of formula (I), wherein Hal represents fluoro, and one of R' and R^ represents hydrogen and the other fluoro, in particular if R' represents fluoro and R^ hydrogen. By the way of example, in case of manufacturing (2R,3R)-3-(2',5'-difluorophenyl)-3,4-epoxy-2-butanol, yields of about 80% and more can be achieved with the process of the present invention, with no other diastereoisomers being detected, whereas the standard Mitsunobu reaction yields only about 50% as already mentioned above.<br>

Example 1 (2S)-1-(2,5-Difluoro-phenyl)-2-(tetrahydro-pyran-2-yloxy)-propan-1-one.<br>
1,4-Difluorobenzene (1.8 g; 15.8 mmol) and (2S)-1-Morpholin-4-yl-2-(tetrahydro-pyran-2-yloxy)-propan-1-one (3 g; 10.5 mmol) are dissolved in dry THF (15 ml). The mixture is cooled to 0°C and then lithium diisopropylamine (7.9 ml of a 2IVI solution in THF/Heptane; 15.8 mmol) is added dropwise over a period of 20 minutes. The mixture is stirred for another 2 hours at 0°C. The reaction is then quenched with a saturated ammonium chloride solution. The reaction mixture is extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic phase is washed with water and brine and then dried over magnesium sulfate. The solids are filtered off and the solvent is removed under reduced pressure. The crude product is chromatographed over silicagel (eluent: Petrol ether/Ethyl acetate 50:1 to 30:1). 1.31 g of yellow crystalline material (yield 44.8%) is obtained with a HPLC purity of 96.2%. NMR; (CDCI3; 400 MHz): 7.53-7.47 (m; 1H); 7.24-7.16(m; 1H); 7.15-7.07 (m; 1H); 5.10 (qd; J=7.2 Hz; 2.0Hz; 1/2H); 4.85 (q; J=7.2 Hz; 1/2H); 4.74 (m; 1/2H); 4.64 (m; 1/2H); 3.89 (m; 1/2H); 3.71 (m; 1/2H); 3.51 (m; 1/2H); 3.34 (m; 1/2H); 1.90-1.48 (m; 6H); 1.47 (d; J=7.2 Hz; 1.5H); 1.42 (d; J=7.2 Hz; 1.5H).<br>
Example 2 1(S)-[2-(2,5-Dif[uoro-phenyl)-1-methyl-allyloxy]-tetrahydro-pyran.<br>
Methyl triphenylphosphonium iodide (11.1 g; 27.7 mmol) was suspended in dry THF (100 ml). The reaction mixture is cooled in an ice bath. A sodium<br><br>
bis(trimethylsilyl)amid solution (30 ml of a 1M solution inTHF) is added at such a rate to keep the temperature belov^/' 20°C. The reaction mixture was stirred for 3 hours at 15°C then was cooled at-78°C. Then (2S)-1-(2,5-Difiuoro-phenyl)-2-(tetrahydro-pyran-2-y!oxy)-propan-1-one (5.0 g; 15.7 mmol in solution in THF (20 ml)) is added to the previous mixture at such a rate to keep the temperature below -70°C. The mixture is stirred 5 minutes at this temperature then for 17 hours at 10°C.<br>
Then ethyl acetate (5 ml) and hexanes (350 ml) was added. The suspension was stirred for 15 minutes (precipitation of triphenylphosphine-oxide). The solids were filtered off. The filter-cake was washed with hexane (60 ml). The filtrate is washed twice with a 1:1 water methanol mixture (2 times 100 ml) and with brine (100 ml).
