				<td>Description<br>
Method for optimizing the operation of a plurality of<br>
compressor assemblies of a natural-gas compression<br>
station<br>
The invention relates to a method for optimizing the<br>
operation of a plurality of compressor assemblies of a<br>
natural-gas compression station.<br>
Natural-gas compression stations of this kind are<br>
controlled or regulated by means of what may be<br>
referred to as station automatics, the task of which is<br>
to implement as actual values the desired values,<br>
predetermined "by" a central dispatching unit, for<br>
specific characteristic values of the natural-gas<br>
compression station. The station throughflow, which is<br>
the throughflow quantity through the natural-gas<br>
compression station, the suction pressure on the inlet<br>
side of the natural-gas compression station, the final<br>
pressure on the outlet side of the natural-gas<br>
compression station or the final temperature on the<br>
outlet side of the natural-gas compression station may<br>
function as desired values of this kind.<br>
The compressor assemblies of such natural-gas<br>
compression stations often differ from one another both<br>
in the very differently designed drive machines and in<br>
different rotors, by means of which the gas transport<br>
through the natural-gas compression station is carried<br>
out.<br>
The subject on which the invention is based is to make<br>
available a method for optimizing the operation of a<br>
plurality of compressor assemblies of a natural-gas<br>
compression station, by means of which method the<br>
interaction of a plurality of compressor assemblies of<br>
the natural-gas compression station is automated in an<br>
optimum way by a regulation of the characteristic maps<br>
of the compressor assemblies, the characteristic maps<br>
of the compressor assemblies being capable of having<br>
 considerable differences from one another.<br>
This object is achieved, according to the invention, in<br>
that, after the start of a second or a further<br>
compressor assembly of the natural-gas compression<br>
station, the rotational speeds of the running<br>
compressor assemblies are run in a fixed rotational<br>
speed ratio with respect to characteristic-map data<br>
filed for each compressor assembly, thereafter this<br>
fixed rotational speed ratio is varied by means of an<br>
equal-percentage throughflow quantity adjustment via<br>
the rotational speed, until surge prevention Valves of<br>
the natural-gas compression station are closed,<br>
thereafter the operating points of the compressor<br>
assemblies in their characteristic maps are lead as far<br>
as possible toward the maximum efficiency line,<br>
thereafter, in. a continuous operating mode of the<br>
natural-gas compression station, optimum rotational-<br>
speed desired values are determined by a reciprocal<br>
trimming or mutually coordinated variation of the<br>
rotational-speed desired values of the compressor<br>
assemblies, the fuel consumption of the natural-gas<br>
compression station being kept under observation, and,<br>
on the basis of optimum rotational-speed desired values<br>
thus determined, the stored fixed rotational speed<br>
ratio is adjusted and stored.<br>
By the rotational-speed desired values of the various<br>
compressor assemblies being trimmed, an optimum<br>
position of the individual operating points in the<br>
various characteristic maps of the compressor<br>
assemblies and therefore a minimum use of fuel for the<br>
compressor output demanded by the natural-gas<br>
compression station are achieved. By virtue of the<br>
minimization of fuel consumption achieved in this way,<br>
the emission of the exhaust-gas quantity and therefore<br>
the emission of NOx and CO2 are reduced.<br>
The above-outlined sequence control for the purpose of<br>
minimizing the fuel consumption of the natural-gas<br>
compression station can advantageously be implemented<br>
on the basis of the automation program installed for<br>
operating the natural-gas compression station, so that<br>
there is no need for a separate optimization program or<br>
any other program module. In the method according to<br>
the invention, optimization, taking into account the<br>
minimization of the fuel consumption of the natural-gas<br>
compression station, is carried out<br>
by means of mutually coordinated characteristic-curve<br>
displacements of the individual compressor assemblies.<br>
In an advantageous embodiment of the method according<br>
to the invention, the rotational-speed desired values<br>
for the individual compressor assemblies are<br>
transmitted by a station controller of the natural-gas<br>
compression station to individual rotational-speed<br>
controllers of the individual compressor assemblies,<br>
the controlled variable used for the station controller<br>
being that controlled variable of a plurality of<br>
controlled variables which has the lowest positive<br>
control deviation.<br>
The station throughflow or throughflow quantity, the<br>
suction pressure, the final pressure or the final<br>
temperature of the natural-gas compression station may<br>
function as controlled variables.<br>
The trimming or the mutually coordinated variation of<br>
the rotational-speed desired values of the individual<br>
compressor assemblies of the natural-gas compression<br>
station, taking into account the minimization of the<br>
fuel consumption of the entire natural-gas compression<br>
station, can advantageously be carried out by means of<br>
an optimization computer arranged between the station<br>
controller and the individual rotational-speed<br>
controllers of the individual compressor assemblies.<br>
The invention is explained in more detail below with<br>
reference to an embodiment,<br>
Fig. 1 showing compressor characteristic maps of<br>
compressor assemblies, and<br>
Fig. 2 showing an operating and observation surface<br>
of a PC monitor used for controlling a<br>
compressor station.<br>
A natural-gas compression station has a multiplicity of<br>
individual compressor assemblies which have at least<br>
partially different<br>
drive machines and different rotors, this being<br>
attributable, for example, to the fact that compressor<br>
assemblies are designed for covering basic-load<br>
operation and compressor assemblies are designed for<br>
covering peak-load operation.<br>
In order to optimize the operation of a plurality of<br>
compressor assemblies of a natural-gas compression<br>
station, after the successful start of a further or<br>
additional compressor assembly of the natural-gas<br>
compression station, a station controller of the<br>
natural-gas compression station will run the rotational<br>
speeds of the now operative compressor assemblies of<br>
the natural-gas compression station in a fixed<br>
rotational speed ratio to the characteristic-map data<br>
filed for each compressor assembly.<br>
This fixed rotational-speed ratio is subsequently<br>
varied by means of an equal-percentage throughflow<br>
quantity adjustment via the rotational speed of the<br>
individual compressor assemblies, until surge<br>
prevention valves present in the natural-gas<br>
compression station are closed. Due to the closing of<br>
the surge prevention valves, a first fuel reduction<br>
takes place during the operation of the natural-gas<br>
compression station. What is achieved at the same time<br>
by the closing of the surge prevention valves is that<br>
the transport gas to be compressed or transported by<br>
means of the natural-gas compression station is heated<br>
to a lesser extent, with the result that, in turn, the<br>
energy balance at the natural-gas compression station<br>
has a more favorable configuration.<br>
When all the surge prevention valves of a natural-gas<br>
compression station are closed, the operating points of<br>
the individual compressor assemblies in their<br>
characteristic maps are lead toward their maximum<br>
efficiency line, in so far as this is possible.<br>
During the subsequent continuous operating mode of the<br>
natural-gas compression station, optimum values for the<br>
rotational-speed desired values of the individual<br>
compressor assemblies are then searched for by means of<br>
a reciprocal trimming or mutually coordinated variation<br>
of the rotational-speed desired values of the<br>
individual compressor assemblies and<br>
the observation of the overall fuel consumption of the<br>
natural-gas compression station. After these optimum<br>
rotational-speed desired values are determined for the<br>
individual compressor assemblies, the abovementioned<br>
fixed rotational speed ratio with respect to the filed<br>
characteristic-map data is adjusted according to the<br>
optimum rotational-speed desired values determined and<br>
is then stored.<br>
The controlled variable having the lowest positive<br>
control deviation functions as the controlled variable<br>
for the station controller of the natural-gas<br>
compression station. The rotational-speed desired value<br>
for the individual compressor assemblies is made<br>
available on the output side of the station controller.<br>
The transfer of these rotational-speed desired values<br>
made available on the output side of the station<br>
controller to the individual compressor assemblies is<br>
carried out by rotational-speed controllers which are<br>
assigned to the individual control units of the<br>
individual compressor assemblies.<br>
In order to take into account the different design of<br>
the individual compressor assemblies, the rotational-<br>
speed desired values, before being transmitted to the<br>
rotational-speed controllers of the individual<br>
compressor assemblies, are trimmed by an optimization<br>
computer connected between the station controller and<br>
these individual rotational-speed controllers.<br>
