				<td>ECHINOCANDIN PHARMACEUTICAL FORMULATIONS<br>
CONTAINING MICELLE-FORMING SURFACTANTS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to pharmaceutical formulations containing an<br>
echinocandin compound, in particular, the incorporation of micelle-forming surfactants to<br>
enhance stability and water solubility.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Parenteral (ip) formulations of pharmaceutical drugs may be administered to<br>
patients via intramuscular (im), intravenous (iv) or subcutaneous methodology. The<br>
formulation that is developed for a particular drug is dependent on a variety of issues. For<br>
example, it is well-known in the art that a formulation should be water-soluble and stable.<br>
If freeze-dried the formulation should be capable of forming a well-formed cake and readily<br>
reconstitutable (usually in less than one minute). Finally, the formulation should have an<br>
acceptable appearance and be prepared from generally accepted, safe excipients.<br>
Stability is an important consideration when designing a formulation, especially for<br>
ip applications. For practical reasons, it must be possible to store the formulation for at<br>
least two years. Therefore, it is often desirable to freeze dry the formulation to achieve<br>
better shelf-life and storage at room temperature.<br>
The instability and poor water solubility (
compounds make them particularly difficult to formulate. Most of the formulations tested<br>
to date have a shelf life of less than one year. Generally, a shelf life of two or more years is<br>
a required. Consequently, a formulation containing an echinocandin compound may<br>
require freeze-drying to achieve the necessary stability.<br>
The poor water solubility of the echinocandin compounds affords a further<br>
challenge in formulating an ip formulation containing echinocandin active materials. One<br>
method of formulating such compounds is by the addition of a surfactant which enhances<br>
the solubility of the drug. However, it is generally well-known in the art that the use of a<br>
surfactant above a certain concentration generally limits the ability to freeze dry the<br>
formulation. A typical freeze-dried formulation has a surfactant concentration less than 5%<br>
by weight. According to a market survey of freeze-dried pharmaceutical formulations<br>
containing surfactants, the surfactant concentration is usually less than 5% weight in the<br>
freeze dried product. See. Carpenter et al., Pharm. Res., 14 (8), 969-975, 1977 to 1997.<br>
Physicians" Desk Reference. 50"' edition. Medical Economics. Co. NJ (1996). It is<br>
generally believed that a formulation with higher concentrations of surfactant is not likely<br>
to form a freeze-dried product with desirable characteristics. Specifically, the presence of<br>
the surfactant causes the freeze-dried cake to "collapse" resulting in a residue at the bottom<br>
of the vial instead of a well-formed cake. The residue is generally less stable, difficult to<br>
reconstitute, and non-reproducible.<br>
Because of the poor water solubility of the echinocandin compounds, generally 2-<br>
4% (weight by volume) of a surfactant is required to obtain an acceptable concentration of<br>
the echinocandin compound in solution. As discussed above, freeze-drying is hindered at<br>
this level of surfactant. Therefore, there is a need for a formulation that improves the<br>
solubility of echinocandin compounds in water yet allows freeze drying to obtain optimum<br>
stability.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Applicants have discovered a group of surfactants that solubilize echinocandin<br>
compounds at higher concentrations and surprisingly retain the ability to freeze dry the<br>
formulation. In one embodiment of the present invention, a parenteral pharmaceutical<br>
formulation is provided that comprises (i) an echinocandin compound (or a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof), (ii) a pharmaceutically acceptable, micelle-<br>
forming surfactant (e.g., polysorbates. lecithin, bile salts, polyoxyethylene castor oils and<br>
mixtures thereof), and (iii) a non-toxic, aqueous solvent. The pharmaceutical solution<br>
formulation may optionally contain one or more of a stabilizing agent, a tonicity agent<br>
and/or a buffer. The weight ratio of echinocandin to surfactant is from about 1:1.75 to<br>
about 1:25 (more preferably in a ratio of about 1:2 to about 1:3) and the echinocandin<br>
compound is present in an amount greater than or equal to 1 mg/ml. The surfactant is<br>
cenerally present in an amount greater than 1% weight per volume.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, a freeze-dried pharmaceutical<br>
formulation is provided that comprises (i) an echinocandin compound (or a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof), (ii) a pharmaceutically acceptable, micelle-<br>
forming surfactant (e.g., polysorbates. lecithin, bile salts, polyoxyethylene castor oils, and<br>
mixtures thereof), and (iii) a bulking agent. The micelle-forming surfactant is present in an<br>
amount greater than 5% by weight in the freeze dried product and the ratio of echinocandin<br>
to surfactant is from about 1:1.75 to about 1:25 (preferably in a ratio of about 1:2 to about<br>
1:3). The pharmaceutical freeze-dried formulation may optionally contain one or more of a<br>
stabilizing agent and/or a buffer. A parenteral pharmaceutical formulation prepared from<br>
the freeze-dried formulation is also provided.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention, a process is provided for<br>
preparing a parenteral formulation, which comprises mixing an echinocandin compound (or<br>
echinocandin/carbohydrate complex) and a pharmaceutically acceptable, micelle-forming<br>
surfactant in an aqueous solvent.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, a process is provided for making a<br>
freeze-dried formulation comprising in the following order the steps of: (i) dissolving into<br>
an aqueous solvent an echinocandin compound (or echinocandin/carbohydrate complex) in<br>
the presence of a pharmaceutically acceptable, micelle-forming surfactant, wherein the<br>
surfactant is present in an amount greater than 1% weight by volume; (ii) sterile filtering<br>
the solution; and (iii) freeze-drying the solution. Generally, a bulking agent is added before<br>
freeze-drying the solution. Optionally, one may add one or more buffers, stabilizing<br>
agents, tonicity agents, or combinations thereof before step (iii).<br>
An alternative preparation for a freeze-dried formulation is also provided which<br>
comprises (i) buffering a non-toxic aqueous solvent to a pH between 4.0 and 5.0 to form a<br>
buffered solution; (ii) adding to the buffered solution a pharmaceutically acceptable,<br>
micelle-forming surfactant; (iii) cooling the solution from step (ii) to a temperature between<br>
5° and 15°C (preferably between 7° and 10°C) to form a cooled solution; (iv) adding a _<br>
slurry comprising an echinocandin compound or echinocandin/carbohydrate complex and a<br>
second non-toxic aqueous solvent to the cooled solution; (v) sterile filtering said solution<br>
from step (iv); and (vi) freeze-drying said solution from step (v). One or more bulking<br>
agents, stabilizing agents and/or tonicity agents may optionally be added prior to step (v).<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, a parenteral pharmaceutical<br>
product is provided which is prepared by dissolving into an aqueous solvent an<br>
echinocandin compound (or echinocandin/carbohydrate complex) in the presence of a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable, micelle-forming surfactant to form a solution, wherein the<br>
surfactant is present in an amount greater than 1% weight per volume; (ii) sterile filtering<br>
the solution; and (iii) freeze-drying the solution in a vial, wherein the weight ratio of<br>
eehinocandin to surfactant is from about 1:1.75 to about 1:25. When ready for use. a non-<br>
toxic, aqueous solvent is added to the vial.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention, a method is provided for<br>
treating an antifungal infection in a mammal in need thereof, which comprises<br>
administering to the mammal the parenteral formulation described above or a parenteral<br>
formulation prepared by adding a pharmaceutically acceptable aqueous solvent to one of<br>
the freeze-dried formulations described above.<br>
Amounts and percentages are described herein as weight units unless otherwise<br>
stated.<br>
The term "echinocandin" refers to a compound having the following general<br>
structure:<br>
where: R is an alkyl group, an alkenyl group, an alkynyl group, an aryl group, heteroaryl<br>
group, or combinations thereof; R1, R2, R3, R6, R7, and R10 are independently hydroxy or<br>
hydrogen; R4 is hydrogen, methyl or -CH2C(O)NH2; R5 and R11 are independently methyl or<br>

or -OSO3H.<br>
The tenn "alkyl" refers to a hydrocarbon radical of the general formula CnH2n+1<br>
containing from 1 to 30 carbon atoms unless otherwise indicated. The alkane radical may<br>
be straight, branched, cyclic, or multi-cyclic. The alkane radical may be substituted or<br>
unsubstituted. Similarly, the alkyl portion of an alkoxy group or alkanoate have the same<br>
definition as above.<br>
The term "alkenyl" refers to an acyclic hydrocarbon containing at least one carbon-<br>
carbon double bond. The alkene radical may be straight, branched, cyclic, or multi-cyclic.<br>
The alkene radical may be substituted or unsubstituted.<br>
The term "alkynyl" refers to an acyclic hydrocarbon containing at least one carbon<br>
carbon triple bond. The alkyne radical may be straight, or branched. The alkyne radical<br>
may be substituted or unsubstituted.<br>
The term "aryl" refers to aromatic moieties having single (e.g.. phenyl) or fused ring<br>
systems (e.g., naphthalene, anthracene, phenanthrene, etc.). The aryl groups may be<br>
substituted or unsubstituted. Substituted aryl groups include a chain of aromatic moieties<br>
(e.g., biphenyl. terphenyl, phenylnaphthalyl. etc.).<br>
The term '"heteroaryl" refers to aromatic moieties containing at least one heteroatom<br>
within the aromatic ring system (e.g., pyrrole, pyridine, indole, thiophene. furan.<br>
benzofuran, imidazole, pyrimidine, purine, benzimidazole, quinoline. etc.). The aromatic<br>
moiety may consist of a single or fused ring system. The heteroaryl groups may be<br>
substituted or unsubstituted.<br>
Within the field of organic chemistry and particularly within the field of organic<br>
biochemistry, it is widely understood that significant substitution of compounds is tolerated<br>
or even useful. In the present invention, for example, the term alky] group allows for<br>
substituents which is a classic alkyl, such as methyl, ethyl, isopropyl. isobutyl. tertiary<br>
butyl, hexyl, isooctyl, dodecyl. stearyl, etc. The term group specifically envisions and<br>
allows for substitutions on alky is which are common in the art, such as hydroxy, halogen,<br>
alkoxy, carbonyl, keto. ester, carbamato, etc., as well as including the unsubstituted alkyl<br>
moiety. However, it is generally understood by those skilled in the art that the substituents<br>
should be selected so as to not adversely affect the pharmacological characteristics of the<br>
compound or adversely interfere with the use of the medicament. Suitable substituents for<br>
any of the groups defined above include alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, aryl, halo, hydroxy, alkoxy,<br>
aryloxy, mercapto, alkylthio, arylthio, mono- and di-alkyl amino, quaternary ammonium<br>

glycolyl, glycyl, hydrazino, guanyl, and combinations thereof.<br>
"Echinocandin/carbohydrate complex" refers to a crystalline complex formed<br>
between an echinocandin compound and an carbohydrate when the echinocandin is<br>
recrystallized from a solvent in the presence of the carbohydrate. A more detailed<br>
description of the echinocandin/carbohydrate complexes may be found in Larew, et al.,<br>
filed on March 3, 1999 entitled "Echinocandin/Carbohydrate Complexes."<br>
"Carbohydrate" refers to an aldehydic or ketonic derivative of polyhydric alcohols<br>
represented by the formulas Cn(H2O)n (e.g., glucose, C6(H2O)t; sucrose. C,2(H2O)n).<br>
Carbohydrates include compounds with relatively small molecules, such as the simple<br>
sugars (e.g., monosaccharides, disaccharides, etc.), as well as macromolecular (polymeric)<br>
substances such as starch, glycogen, and cellulose polysaccharides. Sugars are<br>
carbohydrates (saccharides) having the general composition (CH2O)n and simple derivatives<br>
thereof. Although the simple monomeric sugars (glycoses) are described as polyhydroxy<br>
aldehydes or ketones, e.g., HOCH2-(CHOH)4-CHO for aldohexoses (e.g., glucose) or _<br>
HOCH2-(CHOH)3-CO-CH2OH for 2-ketoses (e.g., fructose), the structures are commonly<br>
written as five (furanose) or six (pyranose) membered ring cyclic ethers, e.g.<br>
The term '"micelle-forming surfactant" refers to an amphophilic material that<br>
spontaneously and reversibly forms a water soluble aggregate. For a more detailed<br>
description of micelle formation and a listing of micelle-forming surfactants see Attwood et<br>
al. Surfactant Systems. Their Chemistry. Pharmacy and Biology, Chapman and Hall<br>
(1983). Block copolymers of propylene oxide and ethylene oxide do not perform well in<br>
the formulations of the present invention; therefore, these block copolymers are not<br>
considered within the meaning of micelle-forming surfactants.<br>
The term "pharmaceutically acceptable" when used herein as an adjective, means<br>
substantially non-toxic and substantially non-deleterious to the recipient.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
The cyclic peptides used in the present invention may be produced by culturing<br>
various microorganisms. Suitable natural product starting materials belonging to the<br>
echinocandin cyclic peptide family include Echinocandin B, Echinocandin C, Echinocandin<br>
D, Aculeacin A?, Mulundocandin, Sporiofungin A, Pneumocandin Ao, WF11899A. and<br>
Pneumocandin Bo. In general, the cyclic peptides may be characterized as a cyclic<br>
hexapeptide nucleus with an acylated amino group on one of the amino acids. The amino<br>
group on the naturally-occurring cyclic peptide is typically acylated with a fatty acid group<br>
forming a side chain off the nucleus. Examples of naturally-occurring acyl groups include<br>
linoleoyl (Echinocandin B, C and D), palmitoyl (Aculeacin A? and WFl 1899A). stearoyl,<br>
12-methylmyristoyl (Mulundocandin). 10.12-dimethylmyristoyl (Sporiofungin A and<br>
Pneumocandin Ao) and the like.<br>
Semi-synthetic derivatives may be prepared by removing the fatty acid side chain<br>
from the cyclic peptide nucleus to produce a free amino group (i.e.. no pendant acyl group<br>
C(O)R). The free amine is then reacylated with a suitable acyl group. For example, the<br>
echinocandin B nucleus has been re-acylated with certain non-naturally occurring side<br>
chain moieties to provide a number of antifungal agents. See. i.e., U.S. Patent No.<br>
4.293,489. Those skilled in the an will appreciate that the N-acyl side chain encompasses a<br>
variety of side chain moieties known in the art. Suitable side chain moieties include<br>
substituted and unsubstituted alkyl groups, alkenyl groups, alkynyl groups, aryl groups,<br>
heteroaryl groups and combinations thereof. Preferably, the side chain contains both a<br>
linearly rigid section and a flexible alkyl section to maximize antifungal potency.<br>
Representative examples of preferred acyl side chains include R groups having the<br>
following structures:<br>
where A, B, C and D are independently hydrogen, C1-C12 alkyl, C2-C12 alkynyl, C1-C12<br>
alkoxy, C1-C12 alkylthio, halo, or -O-(CH2)m-[O-(CH2)n]p-O-(C1-C12 alkyl), or -O-(CH2)q-X-<br>
E; m is 2, 3 or 4; n is 2, 3 or 4; p is 0 or 1; q is 2, 3 or 4; X is pyrrolidine piperidino or<br>
piperazino; and E is hydrogen, C1-C12 alkyl, C3-C12 cycloalkyl, benzyl or C3-C12<br>
cycloalkylmethyl.<br>
As noted above, the cyclic peptides described herein may be prepared by<br>
fermentation of known microorganisms as described in the art. The subsequent deacylation<br>
is typically carried out enzymatically using a deacylase enzyme by known materials and<br>
procedures described in the art.<br>
For example. U.S. Patent No. 3.293.482 describes the deacylation and preparation<br>
of the cyclic peptide of formula I where R4, R5. and R11 are methyl, R9 is hydrogen, and R10<br>
R2, R3, R6, R7, R8 and R10 are each hydroxy. U.S. Patent No. 4,299.763 describes the<br>
deacylation and preparation of the cyclic peptide of formula I where R4, R5. and R11 are<br>
methyl, R2 is hydroxy, R7 and R9 are hydrogen and R1, R3. R6, R8 and R10 are each hydroxy.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 3.978.210 describes the preparation of aculeacin. U.S. Patent No.<br>
4.304,716 describes the deacylation and preparation of the cyclic peptide of formula I<br>
where R5 is -CH2C(O)NH2; R11 is methyl; R4 and R9 are hydrogen; R1, R2, R3, R6, R7, R8 and<br>
R10 are each hydroxy and the acyl group with substituent R is myristoyl.<br>
Cyclic peptides where R2 and R7 are each hydrogen may be prepared by subjecting<br>
the corresponding compound (where R2 and R7 are each hydroxy; the ornithine alpha-amino<br>
group may be a free amino group or acylated) to a strong acid and a reducing agent at a<br>
temperature of between -5°C and 70°C, in a suitable solvent. Suitable strong acids include<br>
trichloroacetic acid, trifluoroacetic acid or boron trifluoride etherate.. A preferred strong<br>
acid is trifluoroacetic acid. Suitable reducing agents include sodium cyanoborohydride or<br>
triethylsilane. A preferred reducing agent is triethylsilane. Suitable solvents include<br>
methylene chloride, chloroform or acetic acid, preferably methylene chloride. The strong<br>
acid is present in an amount from about 2 to 60 mol per mol of substrate, and the reducing<br>
agent is present in an amount from about 2 to 60 mol per mol of substrate. The acid<br>
reduction process selectively removes the aminal (R2) and benzylic (R7) hydroxy groups.<br>
Acylation of the a-amino group on the ornithine unit may be accomplished in a<br>
variety of ways well known to those skilled in the art. For example, the amino group may<br>
be acylated by reaction with an appropriately substituted acyl halide, preferably in the<br>
presence of an acid scavenger such as a tertiary amine (e.g., triethylamine). The reaction is<br>
typically carried out at a temperature between about -20°C to 25ºC. Suitable reaction<br>
solvents include polar aprotic solvents, such as dioxane or dimethylformamide. Solvent<br>
choice is not critical so long as the solvent employed is inert to the ongoins reaction and the<br>
reactants are sufficiently solubilized to effect the desired reaction.<br>
The amino group may also be acylated by reaction with an appropriately substituted<br>
carboxylic acid, in the presence of a coupling agent. Suitable coupling aeents include<br>
dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), N.N'-carbonyldiimidazole, bis(2-oxo-3-<br><br>
oxazolidinyl)phosphinic chloride (BOP-Cl), N-ethoxycarbonyl-2-ethoxy-1,2-<br>
dihydroquinoline (EEDQ), benzotriazole-1-yloxy- tripynolidinophosphonium<br>
hexafluorophosphate (PyBOP) and the like.<br>
Alternately, the amino group may be acylated with an activated ester of a carboxylic<br>
acid such as p-nitrophenyl. 2.4.5-trichlorophenyl, hydroxybenzotriazole hydrate<br>
(HOBT-H2O), pentafluorophenol. and N-hydroxysuccinimide carboxylate esters. Preferred<br>
acylating moieties are the 2,4.5-trichlorophenyl and HOEBT carboxylate esters. The<br>
reaction is typically ran 1 to 65 hours at a temperature from about 0°C to 30°C in an aprotic<br>
solvent. The reaction is generally complete after about 24 to 48 hours when carried out at a<br>
temperature between about 15°C to 30°C. Suitable solvents include tetrahydrofuran and<br>
dimethylformamide or mixtures thereof. The amino group is generally present in<br>
equimolar proportions relative to the activated ester or with a slight excess of the amino<br>
group.<br>
The R-COOH precursor acids are prepared by hydrolyzing a.nitrile of the formula<br>
R-CN or an ester of the formula R-COO(C1-C4 alkyl). The nitrile and ester intermediates<br>
may be prepared using procedures known in the art. For example, the nitrile and ester<br>
intermediates wnere R is an alkoxy aryl moiety may be prepared using Procedure A or<br>
Procedure B.<br>
Procedure A One equivalent of an alkyl bromide, iodide, or p-toluenesulfonate is<br>
added to a mixture containing one equivalent of a base, such as potassium t-butoxide or<br>
potassium carbonate (K2CO3), and one equivalent of an hydroxy aryl compound in 200-<br>
300ml of acetonitrile (CH3CN). The reaction mixture is refluxed for 6h and then<br>
concentrated in vacuo to provide a residue which is dissolved in a Et2O/2N NaOH mixture.<br>
The resulting layers are separated and the organic layer is dried over magnesium sulfate<br>
(MgSO4), filtered and dried to provide the alkoxy aryl product.<br>
Procedure B Diethylazodicarboxylate (1 equiv.) is added dropwise to a mixture<br>
containing an hydroxy aryl compound (1 equiv.). an alkyl alcohol (1 equiv.) and<br>
triphenylphosphine (1 equiv.) in 200-300ml of THF. After 17h, the solvent is removed<br>
in vacuo to provide a residue which is dissolved in Et2O. The resulting mixture is washed<br>
with a 2N NaOH solution, dried over MgSO4, filtered and concentrated to provide a product<br><br>
which is then crystallized from a Et2O/pentane mixture or, if the product contains a tertiary<br>
amine, the hydrochloride salt is formed and crystallized from a methanol (MeOH)/EtOAc<br>
mixture. The nitrile and ester intermediates where R is an alkynyl aryl moiety may be<br>
prepared using Procedure C.<br>
Procedure C A mixture containing Et20 (2 equiv.), palladium dichloride (0.05<br>
equiv.), triphenylphosphine (0.1 equiv.). cuprous iodide (0.025 equiv.) and an alkyne (1<br>
equiv.) is added to one equivalent of an aryl bromide, iodide, or trifiuoromethanesulfonate<br>
in CH3CN (600ml/0.1mol of aryl reactant), under nitrogen (N2). The resulting mixture is<br>
refluxed for 17h and then the solvent is removed in vacuo to provide a residue which is<br>
slurried in 300 ml of Et2O and then filtered. The filtrate is washed with a 1N HCl solution,<br>
dried over MgSO4. filtered and then dried to provide the product. The ester intermediates<br>
where R is a terphenyl moiety may be prepared using Procedure D.<br>
Procedure D<br>
1. Formation of boronic acid reactant<br>
Butyl lithium (1.2 equivalents) is added to one equivalent of a cold (-78°C) aryl<br>
halide in THF. After 15 minutes, triisopropyl borate (2 equiv.) is added. After 10 minutes,<br>
the reaction mixture is wanned to room temperature and quenched by the addition of water<br>
(H2O), followed by the addition of 1N HCl. The resulting layers are separated and the<br>
organic layer is concentrated in vacuo to provide a solid which is collected by filtration and<br>
washed with hexane.<br>
2. Formation of terphenyl ester<br>
Tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium (0.03 equiv.) is added to a mixture<br>
containing an aryl boronic acid (1 equiv.), K2CO3 (1.5 equiv.) and methyl 4-iodobenzoate<br>
(1 equiv.) (or trichlorophenyl ester of iodobenzoate) in N2-purged toluene. The reaction<br>
mixture is refluxed for 7h and then decanted to remove the K2CO3 and dried in vacuo to<br>
provide a residue. This residue is triturated in CH3CN and filtered to provide the product.<br>
The aryl nitriles and esters described above may be converted to the corresponding<br>
carboxylic acids by hydrolysis using Procedure E or Procedure F.<br>
Procedure E An aryl nitrile is dissolved in ethanol (EtOH) and an excess of 50%<br>
NaOH solution and refluxed for 2h. Water is added to the reaction mixture until a solid<br><br>
precipitates. This solid is collected by filtration, added to a dioxane/6N HCl mixture and<br>
the resulting mixture is refluxed for 17h. When the reaction is substantially complete, the<br>
carboxylic acid product is crystallized by the addition of H,0 and then collected by<br>
filtration and dried in vacuo.<br>
Procedure F An excess of 2N NaOH is added to an aryl ester in MeOH. and the<br>
resulting solution is refluxed for 5h and then acidified by the addition of excess HCl.<br>
Water is added to the reaction mixture until a solid (carboxylic acid) precipitates. The<br>
carboxylic acid is collected by filtration and dried in vacuo. The carboxylic acids may be<br>
converted to the corresponding 2.4.5-trichlorophenyl esters using Procedure G. below. The<br>
activated esters are then used to acylate the amino nucleus.<br>
Procedure G A mixture containing an aryl carboxylic acid (1 equiv.), 2,4.5-<br>
trichlorophenol (1 equiv.) and DCC (1 equiv.) in CH2Cl2 is stirred for 17h and then filtered.<br>
The filtrate is concentrated to provide a residue which is dissolved in Et2O, filtered, and<br>
then pentane is added until crystallization begins. The crystals are collected by filtration<br>
and dried in vacuo. Alternatively, the carboxylic acid may be activated by conversion to<br>
the corresponding hydroxybenzotriazole ester using Procedure H.<br>
Procedure H An aryl carboxylic acid (1 equiv.) and a slight excess of N-mesylate<br>
substituted hydroxybenzotriazole (1.2 equiv.) were reacted in the presence of a slight<br>
excess of a base such as triethylamine (Et3N) (1.3 equiv.) in DMF, under N2. When the<br>
reaction was complete, the mixture was diluted with toluene and washed with H2O. The<br>
organic portion was diluted with H2O and then filtered using /-butyl methyl ether (MTBE)<br>
for transferring the material. The resultant solid was washed with MTBE and then dried in<br>
vacuo.<br>
The echinocandin compound may be isolated and used per se or in the form of its<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salt or hydrate, or as a echinocandin/carbohydrate complex.<br>
The term "pharmaceutically acceptable salt" refers to non-toxic acid addition salts derived<br>
from inorganic and organic acids. Suitable salt derivatives include halides. thiocyanates,<br>
sulfates, bisulfates. sulfites, bisulfites, arylsulfonates. alkylsulfates, phosphonates.<br>

"Echinocandin/carbohydrate complex" refers to a crystalline complex formed<br>
between an echinocandin compound and an carbohydrate (or sugar) when the echinocandin<br>
is recrystallized from a solvent in the presence of the carbohydrate. A more detailed<br>
description of the echinocandin/carbohydrate complexes may be found in Larew. et al.,<br>
filed on March 3. 1999 entitled "Echinocandin/Carbohydrate Complexes" and incorporated<br>
herein by reference. The complexes are formed using standard crystallization procedures<br>
such as those typically performed for purifying compounds by recrystallization. The<br>
echinocandin material and carbohydrate are dissolved at an elevated temperature<br>
(approximately 45 to 60°C, preferably less than 55°C) in a solvent. The solution is then<br>
slowly cooled until the crystallization begins. A seed crystal (such as a previously<br>
crystallized complex or an insoluble sugar) may be added to initiate crystallization.<br>
Suitable solvents include any solvent, or mixture of solvents, inert to the ongoing reaction<br>
that sufficiently solubilizes the reactants to afford a medium within which to effect the<br>
desired complexation between the carbohydrate and the echinocandin compound, such as<br>
protic or ketone solvents including methanol, ethanol, benzyl alcohol, as well as mixtures<br>
of benzyl alcohol with solvents such as methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, isopropanol, n-<br>
butanol, 2-butanol, t-butanol, 2-pentanol, 2-methyl-l-propanol, MEK, acetone, ethyl<br>

hydrates thereof. Suitable carbohydrates also include the D and L enantiomers. as well as<br>
the alpha and beta anomers of the compounds listed above. Preferred carbohydrates are the<br>
simple sugars (e.g., mono- and di-saccharides).<br>
The echinocandin compound can be present in a formulation of the present<br>
invention prior to freeze drying at concentrations greater than or equal to 1 mg/ml.<br>
Generally, the echinocandin compound is present in a range from about 1 mg/rnl to about<br>
50 mg/ml. preferably at a concentration in the range from about 1 mg/ml to about 40<br>
mg/ml, more preferably from about 1 mg/ml to about 30 mg/ml and most preferably from<br>
about 8 mg/ml to about 12 mg/ml.<br>
The formulations of the present invention contain a micelle-forming surfactant that<br>
is a pharmaceutically acceptable amphiphilic excipient having hydrophobic and hydrophilic<br>
units or groups which are capable of solubilizing a non-water soluble drug in water. HLB<br>
values of 10-18 are generally most favorable for solubilization of the echinocandin<br>
compounds. The surfactant is present in the formulation at a weight ratio of echinocandin<br>
to surfactant from about 1:1.75 to about 1:25, more preferably in a ratio of about 1:2 to<br>
about 1:3. The upper limit of surfactant added to the formulation may be limited by its<br>
toxicity in application of the pharmaceutical medicament; therefore, the upper limit may<br>
vary depending upon the particular surfactant selected. Suitable surfactants include<br>
polysorbates (e.g., polysorbate 80, polysorbate 40, polysorbate 20), polyoxyethylene castor<br>
oil derivatives (e.g., Chemophors™ (polyoxyl 35 castor oil, polyoxyl 40 hydrogenated<br>
castor oil. and polyoxyl 60 hydrogenated castor oil) available from BASF)),<br>
polyoxyethylene stearates (e.g., Solutol™ HS 15 (macrogol-660-hydroxystearate, available<br>
from BASF), sorbitan trioleate, bile salts (e.g., cholic acids, deoxycholic acids and salts<br>
thereof (e.g., sodium deoxycholate or sodium taurodeoxycholate)), lecithin, and the like.<br>
Preferred surfactants include polysorbate 80, polysorbate 40,polysorbate 20, and<br>
polyoxyethylene hydroxystearates having reduced histamine effects (e.g., Solutol™ HS<br>
15). Surfactants that do not solubilize well include certain poloxamers which are block<br>
copolymers of propylene oxide and ethylene oxide.<br>
"Polysorbate" refers to materials having the following general structure:<br>
where x+y+w+z is equal to an integer between 5 and 20.<br>
The commercial product Tween™ 20. 40 and 80 (available from ICI Americas Inc.,<br>
Wilmington, DL) are represented by the above structure when x+y+w+z = 20.<br>

R is typically the residue from stearic acid, palmitic acid or oleic acid.<br>
"Bile salts" refer to materials having the following general structure:<br>
where R3, R7, and R12 are -OH, -H or -SO3" groups and R24 is -OH or an alkali salt of-<br>
CO2, -C(O)NH(CH2)nSO3, or -C(O)NH(CH2)nCO2-and n is equal to an integer between 1<br>
and 4.<br>
A typical solution formulation includes an echinocandin compound and a micelle-<br>
forming surfactant. Applicants have observed that the incorporation of the micelle-forming<br>
surfactant not only optimizes the solubilization of the echinocandin compound but also<br>
enhances the stability of the solution. The formulation may optionally include one or more<br>
of a buffer, a stabilizing agent, and/or a tonicity agent. If the formulation is in the form of a<br>
solution then a solvent is also present. Solvents are generally selected based on solvents<br>
recognized as safe (GRAS) to be administered parenterally to a mammal. In general, safe<br>
solvents are non-toxic aqueous solvents such as, water and other non-toxic solvents that are<br>
soluble or miscible in water. Suitable solvents include water, ethanol, propylene glycol,<br>
polyethylene glycols (e.g., PEG400. PEG300). etc. and mixtures thereof. A preferred<br>
solvent is water.<br>
A typical freeze-dried formulation includes an echinocandin compound, a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable micelle-forming surfactant, a bulking agent and/or a<br>
stabilizing agent. The formulation may optionally include one or more buffering agents.<br>
Applicants have observed that the addition of the micelle-forming surfactant not only<br>
optimizes the reconstitution of the freeze-dried formulation in a non-toxic aqueous solvent<br>
but also provides enhanced stability to the freeze-dried materials.<br>
Both solution and freeze-dried formulations may optionally contain a stabilizing<br>
agent. A stabilizing agent is generally present at a concentration in the range from about<br>
0.5% to about 40% (wgt./vol.). more preferably at a concentration in the range from about<br>
1% to about 6%. The term "stabilizing agent" refers to a pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
excipient that enhances the chemical or physical stability of the active ingredient in the<br>
formulation. Suitable stabilizing agents include polyols (e.g., polyethylene and propylene<br>
glycols, and carbohydrates such as sucrose, trehalose, fructose, lactose and mannitol),<br>
amino acids and surfactants such as polysorbates and bile salts. Preferred stabilizing agents<br>
for freeze dried formulation include mannitol, sucrose, trehalose, fructose, lactose and<br>
combinations thereof. In solution most preferred stabilizing agents are the bile salts,<br>
polyethylene glycols and propylene glycol.<br>
Both solution and freeze-dried formulations may also optionally contain a buffer.<br>
The buffer is present at a concentration in the range from about 0.03% to about 5.0%<br>
(wgt./vol.), more preferably at a concentration in the range from about 0.1% to about 1.0%.<br>
The term "buffer" refers to a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient that maintains the pH of<br>
the solution within a particular range specific to the buffering system. A suitable pH range<br>
is from pH 3.0-7.0. Preferably the pH range is from 4.0-5.5, more preferably 4.0-5.0.<br>
Suitable buffers include acetates, citrates, phosphates, tartrates, lactates, succinates, amino<br>
acids and the like. Preferred buffers for the solution formulation include acetate, citrate,<br>
tartrates, phosphate salts and combinations thereof. For the freeze dried formulation, the<br>
preferred buffer is tartaric acid.<br>
Solution formulations may optionally contain one or more tonicity agents. The<br>
tonicity agent is generally present at a concentration in the range from about 1 to about 100<br><br>
mg/ml. more preferably in the range from about 9 to about 50 mg/ml. The term "tonicity<br>
agent" refers to a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient that makes the solution compatible<br>
with blood. Tonicity agents are desirable in injectable formulations. Suitable tonicity<br>
agents include glycerin, lactose, mannitol. dextrose, sodium chloride, sodium sulfate,<br>
sorbitol and the like. Preferred tonicity agents include mannitol. sorbitol, lactose and<br>
sodium chloride and combinations thereof.<br>
When freeze-dried. the formulations may optionally contain a bulking agent. The<br>
bulking agent is present in a formulation at a concentration in the range from about 2% to<br>
about 10% (wgt./vol.), more preferably at a concentration in the range from about 3% to<br>
about 6%. The term "bulking agent" refers to a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient that<br>
adds bulk to a formulation which results in a well-formed cake upon freeze drying.<br>
Suitable bulking agents include mannitol, glycine, lactose, sucrose, trehalose, dextran,<br>
hydroxyethyl starch, ficoll and gelatin. Preferred bulking agents include mannitol. sucrose,<br>
trehalose, lactose and combinations thereof.<br>
The formulations may be prepared using conventional dissolution and mixing<br>
procedures. For example, the bulk drug substance (e.g., echinocandin compound or<br>
echinocandin/carbohydrate complex) is dissolved in a non-toxic aqueous solvent in the<br>
presence of a pharmaceutically acceptable micelle-forming surfactant and optionally one or<br>
more bulking agents, buffers, stabilizing agents and/or tonicity agents. The resulting<br>
solution is then sterile filtered and preferably freeze-dried to provide the desired<br>
formulation. Prior to freeze drying, the surfactant is generally present in an amount greater<br>
than 1% weight per voiume of solution.<br>
Alternatively, the pharmaceutical solution may be prepared by forming an aqueous<br>
buffer solution buffered to a pH from about 3.0 to 7.0 (preferably from 4.0 to 5.5, more<br>
preferably from about 4.0 to 5.0). The buffer used may be any of the buffers described<br>
earlier. The micelle-forming surfactant is then added to the buffered solution and the<br>
solution cooled to about 5° to 15°C (preferably about 7° to 10°C). A slurry of the<br>
echinocandin compound or echinocandia/carbohydrate complex in a non-toxic aqueous<br>
solvent (which may or may not be the same as the solvent used in the buffer solution) is<br>
added to the cooled solution containing the surfactant. One or more bulking agents,<br>
stabilizing agents and/or tonicity agents may be added to the solution prior to freeze-drying.<br><br>
The resultant solution is then diluted with addition solvent, filtered and freeze-dried to<br>
provide the desired formulation.<br>
A suitable method for freeze-drying is described in Nail et al. Freeze Drying<br>
Principles and Practice, in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, 2nd Ed.. Marcel Dekker, Inc. NY,<br>
pp. 163-233 (1993). The formulation is preferably freeze-dried in a vial which can then be<br>
stored until needed. A non-toxic, aqueous solvent is added to the vial to dissolve the<br>
freeze-dried material thus forming a solution that can be used in a parenteral therapeutic<br>
application. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the aqueous solvent includes other<br>
common solutions used in such applications (e.g., saline solutions, dextrose solutions, etc.).<br>
In general, freeze-dried formulations contain a bulking agent and non freeze-dried<br>
formulations contain one or more tonicity agents. In application, the formulations are<br>
typically diluted or reconstituted (if freeze-dried) and further diluted if necessary, prior to<br>
administration. An example of reconstitution instructions for the freeze-dried product are<br>
to add ten ml of water for injection (WFI) to the vial and gently agitate to dissolve. Typical<br>
reconstitution times are less than one minute. The resulting solution is then further diluted<br>
in an infusion solution such as dextrose 5% in water (D5W), prior to administration.<br>
The active ingredient is typically formulated into pharmaceutical dosage forms to<br>
provide an easily controllable dosage of the drug and to give the patient an elegant and<br>
easily handleable product. Formulations may comprise from 0.1% to 60% by weight of<br>
active ingredient, more generally from about 10% to about 30% by weight.<br>
As used herein, the term "unit dose" or "unit dosage" refers to physically discrete<br>
units that contain a predetermined quantity of active ingredient calculated to produce a<br>
desired therapeutic effect. When a unit dose is administered parenterally, it is typically<br>
provided in the form of measured units in ampoules (or vials).<br>
The dosage to be administered may vary depending upon the physical<br>
characteristics of the patient, the severity of the patient's symptoms, and the means used to<br>
administer the drug. The specific dose for a given patient is usually set by the judgment of<br>
the attending physician.<br>
Suitable carriers, diluents and excipients are known in the art and include materials<br>
such as carbohydrates, waxes, water soluble and/or swellable polymers, hydrophilic or<br>
hydrophobic materials, gelatin, oils, solvents, water, and the like. The particular carrier.<br><br>
diluent or excipient used will depend upon the means and purpose for which the active _<br>
ingredient is being applied. The formulations may also include wetting agents, lubricating<br>
agents, emulsifiers. suspending agents, preservatives, sweeteners, perfuming agents,<br>
flavoring agents and combinations thereof.<br>
A pharmaceutical composition may be administered using a variety of methods.<br>
Suitable methods include injection. The particular treatment method used will depend upon<br>
the type of infection being addressed.<br>
Echinocandin and semi-synthetic echinocandin compounds have been shown to<br>
exhibit antifungal and antiparasitic activity such as growth inhibition of various infectious<br>
fungi including Candida spp. (i.e., C. Albicans, C. Parapsilosis, C. Krusei, C. Glabrala, C<br>
Tropicalis, or C. Lusitaniaw); Torulopus spp. (i.e., T. Glabrata); Aspergillus spp. (i.e., A.<br>
Fumigatus): Histoplasma spp. (i.e., H. Capsulatum): Cryptococcus spp. (i.e., C<br>
Neoformans); Blastomyces spp. (i.e.. B. Dermatitidis)\ Fusarium spp.; Trichophyton spp.,<br>
Pseudallescheria boydii, Coccidioides immits, Sporothrix schenckii, etc.<br>
Compounds of this type also inhibit the growth of certain organisms primarily<br>
responsible for opportunistic infections in immunosuppressed individuals, such as growth<br>
inhibition of Pneumocystis carinii (the causative organism of Pneumocystis pneumonia<br>
(PCP) in AIDS and other immunocompromised patients. Other protozoans that are<br>
inhibited by echinocandin-type compounds include Plasmodium spp., Leishmania spp.,<br>
Trypanosoma spp., Cryptosporidium spp., Isospora spp., Cyclospora spp., Trichomnas spp.,<br>
Microsporidiosis spp., etc.<br>
Consequently, the formulations of the present invention are useful in combating<br>
either systemic fungal infections or fungal skin infections. Accordingly, the processes and<br>
formulations of the present invention may be used in the manufacture of a medicament for<br>
the therapeutic applications described herein. For example, fungal activity (preferably,<br>
Candida albicans or Aspergillus fumigatis activity) or parasitic activity may be inhibited by<br>
contacting a pharmaceutical formulation prepared by the present invention with a fungus or<br>
parasite, respectively. The term "contacting" includes a union or junction, or apparent<br>
touching or mutual tangency of a compound of the invention with a parasite or fungus. The<br>
term does not imply any further limitations to the process, such as by mechanism of<br>
inhibition. The methods are defined to encompass the inhibition of parasitic and fungal<br><br>
activity by the action of the compounds and their inherent antiparasitic and antifungal —<br>
properties.<br>
A method for treating a fungal infection which comprises administering an effective<br>
amount of a pharmaceutical formulation of the present invention to a host in need of such<br>
treatment is also provided. A preferred method includes treating a Candida albicans or<br>
Aspergillus fumigatis infection. The term "effective amount" refers to an amount of active<br>
compound which is capable of inhibiting fungal activity. The dose administered will vary<br>
depending on such factors as the nature and severity of the infection, the age and general<br>
health of the host and the tolerance of the host to the antifungal agent. The particular dose<br>
regimen likewise may vary according to these factors. The medicament may be given in a<br>
single daily dose or in multiple doses during the day. The regimen may last from about 2-3<br>
days to about 2-3 weeks or longer. A typical daily dose (administered in single or divided<br>
doses) contains a dosage level between about 0.01 mg/kg to 100 mg/kg of body weight of<br>
an active compound. Preferred daily doses are generally between about 0.1 mg/kg to 60<br>
mg/kg and more preferably between about 2.5 mg/kg to 40 mg/kg.<br>
The following examples are provided to illustrate but not limit the invention. All<br>
references cited herein are hereby incorporated herein by reference.<br>

Compound Preparations<br>
Preparation of 4-Bromo-4 '-pentyloxybiphenyl 1 (a)<br>
Anhydrous K2CO3 (4)6g, 3mol) was added to a mixture of 4-bromo-4'-<br>
hydroxybiphenyl (300g, 1.2mol). 1-iodopentane (234ml. t.79mol) and 2-butanone (600ml).<br>
The reaction mixture was refluxed for 44h until TLC (85:15 hexanes/EtOAc) showed<br>
complete consumption of the bromo alcohol. The mixture was cooled to about 30°C.<br>
diluted with CH2C12 (600ml) and then filtered. The filtrate was washed twice with H2O and<br>
twice with a saturated aqueous NaCl solution, dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, filtered and<br>
then dried at reduced pressure to provide a solid. This solid was isolated by filtration,<br>
washed repeatedly with a total of 2L of ice-cold heptane to remove all traces of iodopentane<br>
and then dried overnight under high vacuum. Yield: 340g (88%) of a white powder.<br>
Alternative Preparation of 4-bromo-4'-pentyloxybiphenyl 1(a):<br>
4-Bromo-4'-hydroxybiphenyl (12.5g. 50.2mmol) was added to a solution of NaOH<br>
(2.28g. 97% pure. 55.2mmol) in deionized H2O (150ml). followed by the addition of<br>
1-iodopentane (11.9g. 60.2mmol) and tetrabutylammonium bromide (0.82g. 2.51mmol).<br>
The mixture was stirred at 90°C for 3.75h until the solids went into solution. Then, as the<br>
reaction proceeded, the desired product began to precipitate. The mixture was slowly<br>
cooled and then filtered to provide a solid which was washed with deionized water until the<br>
pH of the filtrate was neutral and then dried for 16h in a vacuum oven at 30cC.<br>

Preparation of 4-Boronic acid-4'-pentyloxybiphenyl 2(a):<br>
To a cold (-20°C) mixture of Compound 1(a) (lOOg, 0.31mol) in t-butylmethylether<br>
(MTBE) (lL), was slowly added n-butyl lithium (150m) of a 2.5M hexanes solution,<br>
0.37mol) dropwise under N2, while maintaining the internal temperature between -19° and<br>
-18°C. The resultant mixture was stirred for 3.5h between -17° and -16°C which resulted in<br>
a light yellow-green solution. This solution was cooled to -78°C and diluted with 100ml of<br>
anhydrous THF which resulted in a white precipitate. Then, a cold (-78°C) solution of<br>
triisopropylborate (145ml, 0.62mol) in MTBE (200ml), under nitrogen was added dropwise<br>
over 1.5h while maintaining the reaction temperature between -78° and -74°C. The<br>
resultant reaction mixture was stirred for 1.5h at -78°C. then allowed to warm to -50ºC over<br>
1h at which time the cooling bath was removed and the mixture was stirred overnight (16-<br>
21 h) which resulted in a white precipitate. The mixture was shaken vigorously with 2M<br>
HCl (1000ml) for 5 minutes and then the resulting layers were separated and the organic<br>
layer was dried at reduced pressure to provide a residue. This residue was diluted with<br>
MTBE (100ml), followed by heptane (800ml) to provide a white powder which isolated-by<br>
suction filtration and washed 3 times with heptane (300ml).<br>

Preparation of Anti-fungal Compound 6(a):<br>
Deionized water was used throughout the procedure. A mixture of Compound 5(a)<br>
(11 g, 23-mmol) and the nucleus of Compound 6(a) (where R is hydrogen - 92% pure by<br>
HPLC. 19.25 g, 22.2mmol) in anhydrous DMF (275ml) was stirred, under N2 for 4h (until<br>
HPLC showed complete consumption of the cyclic peptide starting material). The mixture<br>
was filtered through a bed of celite and the filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure<br>
at 35°C to provide a paste that could be stirred. This paste was poured into MTBE (500ml)<br>
which resulted in the precipitation of a fine powder which was collected by vacuum<br>
filtration and dried to provide 27g of crude material. This material was crushed to a<br>
powder with a mortar and pestle, slurried for 5 minutes in toluene (200ml). suction filtered<br>
(slow filtered), rinsed with MTBE (100ml) and then dried in vacuo to provide a yellow<br>
solid. Yield: 23 g (95% pure by HPLC, retention time = 7.79 min).<br>
Alternatively, the conversion may be carried out using an excess of the cyclic<br>
nucleus (1.1 equiv.). When the reaction is substantially complete, as indicated by HPLC.<br>
the crude material (10g of a powder) is added portion-wise to a vigorously stirred mixture<br>
of 9:1 acetone/water (60ml). Celite (2.5 g, pre-washed with a 9:1 acetone/water mixture) is<br>
added to the resultant suspension. After stirring for 2 minutes, the mixture is filtered<br>
through a bed of celite (prewashed with 9:1 acetone/water) and the cake is rinsed twice with<br>
9:1 acetone/water (10ml). The filtrate is poured into a beaker of deionized water (200ml)<br>
while gently swirling the mixture which resulted in the formation of a precipitate. This<br>
precipitate is collected by suction filtration, rinsed with H2O (4 x 25ml). and then dried in<br>
vacuo at room temperature. Yield: 6.81g (97% pure by HPLC).<br>
The product was further purified using preparatory HPLC chromatography. Rf 0.29<br>
