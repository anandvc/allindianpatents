				<td>A composition useful for hybrid seed production.<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a composition for hybrid seed production.   More particularly the present<br>
invention also relates to a composition useful or improving female fertility and seed setting in plants.  The<br>
composition of the present invention is useful for production of hybrid seed in crop plants such as whe,at.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Capability of certain classes of chemicals viz.  pyridazines,  4-pyridionones,  pyrrole carboxylates,  5-<br>
chlorocaboxylic acids to effect such changes is know in the literature.   Certain compounds designated as<br>
DPX 3778, Hybrex, LY 195259, Mendok, RH 2956, RH 4667, RH 5148 and WL 84811 are few of the<br>
examples of such compounds. (Pickett A A 1993. In 'Advances in plant Breeding' 15, Paul Parey Scientific<br>
Publisher, Berlin, pp 122-132).  However, these chemicals also affect female sterility resulting in lower seed<br>
setting and seed germination.<br>
The prior art compositions/compounds suffer from several disadvantages in use such as resulting in some<br>
growth inhibition, severe plant damage, small seeds, inhibition of growth and flowering, leaf burn, shorter<br>
plant , etc.   In view of the above limitations it is necessary to provide chemicals and their combinations,<br>
which may provide foolproof male sterility with better female fertility for commercial seed production of hybrid<br>
seed. Although the study and the research was carried out on wheat in the present description, the involved<br>
compositions are not only applicable to the wheat plant but are also to other angiosperm crops as rice,<br>
maize, jowar, bajra, Based on the mode of polliation, the crop plants are classified into three broad groups<br>
namely, self-pollinated, cross pollinated and often cross pollinated.  Exploitation of heterosis through hybrid<br>
breeding is common in cross pollinate and often cross pollinated as their floral structure facilitate natural out<br>
crossing.   Wheat   is a self -pollinated cleistogamy flower wherein flower open only after anther   had<br>
released their pollen load inside the floret.<br>
The success of hybrid breeding depends upon how economically hybrid seed can be produced specially in<br>
self-pollinated crops.    The three plant breeding methodologies known to develop hybrids are genetic,<br>
cytoplasmic-genetic. The success story of hybrid rice is a suitable example for a cytoplasmic male sterility<br>
(CMS) system.<br>
During the process of evolution the A,B and D genomes of Triticum spp and other related species had<br>
combined to form the present hexaploid wheat that man effectively<br><br>
domesticated and commercially grew for food as a cereal crop. These genomes have an<br>
ability to survive independently in nature. This hexaploid nature of wheat could be a probable<br>
reason that restricts the use of CMS system of hybrid seed production. The initiation of global<br>
efforts to use CMS system in early fifties using different sources of male sterility as a mode<br>
of hybrid wheat seed production, faced three main limitations viz. A. Instant ability of male<br>
sterile line over years; B. Lack of complete restoration; C. Limited use of parental lines<br>
because of the tedious and time consuming procedure to develop. A line (male sterile line); B<br>
line (maintainer) and identifying good R line (restorer).<br>
Due to these difficulties, several organizations in the early 1970's shifted their efforts<br>
to the use of chemicals, which can act like gametocides or pollen suppressant. These<br>
chemicals were referred to as "Chemical Hybridizing Agent" (CHA) and a number of CHAs<br>
were evaluated. In last 15 years progress has been made for commercial exploitation of<br>
hybrid wheat through the use of CHAs (see table 1). Table 1 given below shows the results of<br>
investigations made using various chemicals as chemical hybridizing agents (CHA's).<br>
Since early eighties a number of CHA molecules were evaluated against wheat (see<br>
Table 1) that had variable effect on male and female sterility and some of them affected the<br>
plant morphology and caused seed shriveling.<br>
These chemicals differ with respect of female fertility, duration and dose specificity,<br>
genotypic and tissue specificity, developmental stage, physiological state, chronic spray,<br>
fertility impairment, detrimental side effect and phyto-toxicity. (Mahajan V, Nagarajan S<br>
1997. PINSAB64NO. lpp51-58).<br>
In spite of these difficulties a suitable CHA may have a public acceptance if it is an<br>
easy, economical and reliable method for inducing selective male sterility over diverse<br>
environments. The CHA can also become an effective tool for emasculation in a traditional<br>
breeding programme.<br>
In 1997-98, both Ch 9701 and Ch9832 were evaluated over different genotypes<br>
(Mahajan V, Nagarajan S, Deshpande VH and Kelkar R G 2000. Current Science 78 (3):<br>
235-237). At a minimum effective dose for complete male sterility, the female sterility and<br>
seed shriveling was higher in CH9701 while seed setting was numerically higher in CH9832.<br>
The seed germination was comparable (Table 2).<br>
Thus all previous research on CHA was not successful in identifying a combination of<br>
chemicals which may provide a functional hybrid seed production method in wheat with<br>
higher female fertility, seed setting, seed yields, seed viability and versatility over a range of<br>
genotypes and environments.<br>

seed production.<br>

fertility.<br><br>

(Mahajan V, Singh K, Kelkar R.G. 2000. In "Wheat Research Needs Beyond 2000AD<br>
(Eds. Nagarjana S, Singh G and Tyagi B S) Narosa Publishing House, New Delhi pp 101-<br>
106.)<br>
SCIENTIFIC EXPLANATION: Compound of formula 1, (designated hereinafter as<br>
CH9701) was found to cause high female sterility, low seed set along with damage to florets.<br>
Compound of formula 2 (designated hereinafter as CH9832) was found to cause low female<br>
sterility, no damage to florets thereby low seed set due to naturally closed structure of wheat<br>
florets. Both the chemicals exhibited complete male sterility. In the present invention, it was<br>
surprisingly found that when the two compounds of formula 1 and 2 respectively were<br>
combined, along with a non-ionic surfactant, higher female fertility and higher seed set and<br>
stability was achieved across major environments. This composition facilitates a regulated<br>
artifact because little damage to floret permitting easy way to outside pollen to ovary thereby<br>
leading to improved seed setting.<br>
Method for Hybrid Seed Production in Wheat<br>
Planting of male/female lines: An ideal time of planting of hybrid seed production is<br>
from last week of November to the first week of December in North-Western Plains Zone of<br>
India. The male and female were grown alternatively in 2:4 / 3:6 ratios and routine agronomic<br>
practices were followed.<br>
Preparation of Chemical:<br>
The compounds CH9701 and Ch9832 were combined in different formulations. The<br>
proportion of CH9701 can be 30% or below in the formulation while the proportion of<br>
CH9832 can be 70% or above, depending upon genotype, date of planting and growth stage.<br>
A sticking-cum-spreading agents viz. TWEEN 20/TWEEN 80 etc. is mixed in the solution in<br>
small quantity (2-5 ml/liter) and stirred properly.<br>
Spray of Chemical Combination:<br>
The chemical formulation can be used at a rate of 1.8 kg/ha or below (following male:<br>
female ratio of 1:2) depending upon genotypes used, date of planting and growth stage. The<br>
female lines were sprayed with the chemical combination at the appropriate growth stage and<br>
concentration. The spike of 7-12 mm i.e. growth stage 20-22 of Zadoks scale (Zadoks JV,<br>
Chang TT and Konzak CF 1974. Weed Research 14 : 415-421) was ideal for generating<br>
effective male sterility in spring wheat. This stage is reached between 40-50 days after<br>
germination at optimum time of sowing in most of the genotypes. The date of spray varied<br>
depending upon the genotype used. A high volume spray pump may be used so as to cover<br>
the complete female plant.<br>
Post spray operation in hybrid seed production:<br>
On emergence of spike the floret open due to sterility induced by CHA formulation.<br>
At this stage the ovary is to be protected from insects like aphid (Sitobion avanae) and shoot<br>
fly (Alherigona naqvi) that needs to be controlled using dimethoate (Trade name: Rogar ) at<br>
150g a.i./ha and cypermedhrin at 60g ai/ha, respectively. A precautionary spray of "Rogar"<br>
before spike emergence (Stage: 58 of Zadoks scale) help in reducing the initial build-up of<br>
the insect population.<br>
The wheat genotypes vary with respect to pollen extrusion from the wheat floret. In<br>
addition wheat pollen do not have an efficient natural mechanism of pollen dispersal that help<br>
it to reach the ovary of another plant. Studies have shown that wheat pollen cannot go beyond<br>
5m even in the absence of any natural/artificial barrier. The two times (forenoon and evening)<br>
shaking of male parent by rope pulling across male parent help in improving the seed setting<br>
in female parents. A rope is used for shaking male parents as followed in hybrid rice (self<br>
pollinated) seed production. The rope can be moved from one corner to another so that pollen<br>
are lifted along with the rope by shaking and carried to another nearby female plant. This<br>
method may achieve hybrid seed yield up to 0.35 kg/m2 of female plant area.<br>
CONCLUSION: A number of chemicals are known in literature which can cause partial to<br>
complete male sterility but it is also associated with increased female sterility, lower seed<br>
germination, reduced seed size, inhibit plant growth and flowering and other plant damages.<br>
The commercial use of CHAs is possible only if it can be used to produce more viable hybrid<br>
seed in good quantity with least effect on other plant characters. The advantage of proposed<br>
invention is capability to achieve complete male sterility with high female fertility and<br>
normal seed setting facilitating commercial production of hybrid seed of wheat and other<br>
crops across a range of environments.<br>
The main advantages of the present invention are:<br>
1. Improved seed setting in sprayed plants.<br>
2. Lesser female sterility in sprayed plants.<br>
3. Complete male sterility in wheat plants.<br><br><br><br>
