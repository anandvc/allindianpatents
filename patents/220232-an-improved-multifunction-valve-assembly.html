Detailed descriptions of the preferred embodiment are provided herein; however, it is to be understood that the present invention may be embodied in various forms. Therefore, specific details disclosed herein are not to be interpreted as limiting, but rather as a basis for the claims and as a representative basis for teaching one skilled in the art to employ the present invention in virtually any appropriately detailed system, structure or matter.<br>
COMPARITIVE STUDY OVER PRIOR ART<br>
Working of the 80% Fill Limiter assembly in PRIOR ART:<br>
1. During the LPG filling, as the Float assembly is lifted, the float rod guide also rotates. At a certain point the pin fitted in the Non Return Valve (NRV) gets engaged in the slot provided in the float rod guide. With this<br><br><br>
the NRV seals on the seat provided in the bracket and stops further filling of the LPG. 2.   Additional Lever Rod assembly is provided to operate level indicator.<br>
Working of 80% fill Limiter assembly in the present invention:<br><br><br><br>
The float assembly, which is coupled to float rod guide, Lever and bracket assembly, is lifted during the LPG filling. It proportionally rotates the Fill limiter. The Pin/fitted in Fill Limiter also rotates on the surface of Retainer. The moment<br>
the level of 80% capacity is reached or at the moment of the LPG container getting filled upto 80% of its capacity, the Pin fitted in Fill limitog- gets engaged<br>
with the hole provided in the Retainer and Fill limiter moves in downward direction due to the pressure acting from top. The Fill limiter seals on the special soft washer fitted on Retainer. This prevents any further filling of LPG inside the container. Thus in the preferred embodiment of the present invention the automatic 80% Fill Limiter assembly ensures that the LPG is not filled more than 80% capacity of the container.<br>
b) Another preferred embodiment of the present invention is that there is no separate mechanism required for indicating level of auto LPG in the container. Fill Limiter itself is linked with Level Indicator by means of magnets provided in<br>
Fill Limiter &amp; in Level Indicator. As the level in the auto LPG container increases,<br>
float assembly is lifted &amp; inturn Fill Limiter is rotated. As the Fill limiter rotates, <br><br><br>
the needle in Level Indicator also rotates. The needle indicates the amount of LPG in the container. Additionally the rotation of the needle gives signal to the LED Level Indicator fitted on the dashboard, thus indicating the auto LPG level in the tank<br>
Advantages over prior art:<br>
The present invention employs single lever mechanism, which is not the case in any of the prior art mechanisms. Thus by using single mechanism both 80% Fill Limiter &amp; Level Indicator are operated thereby reducing the error to zero. With the provision of soft seal, filling of LPG in the auto LPG container properly shut off once the 80% fill limiter operates.<br>
EXCESS FLOW CHECK VALVE SYSTEM<br>
The LPG flows through the Vapour tube or Pipe. In case the pipeline between outlet of Multifunction Valve and inlet of Regulator bursts, it creates differential pressure between upstream and downstream side of Excess Flow Check Valve. The Excess Flow Check Valve is designed to operate at a differential pressure upto 1 bar. Due to the differential pressure created, the Retainer moves in the direction of flow of auto LPG against the spring force. As the Retainer moves forward, the 'O' Ring fitted on Retainer seals on taper cone provided in the Multifunction valve body, thereby providing positive sealing. This positive<br><br>
sealing restricts the flow of auto LPG. A jet is provided at the center of Retainer, which ensures that minor flow of auto LPG continues through the Excess Flow Check Valve. When the outlet service valve or manual valve is closed, it builds up backpressure thereby causing the Retainer to retain its original position. With the use of soft seal ('O' Ring) there is positive sealing when Excess Flow Check Valve is operated.<br>
Advantages over prior art:<br>
Soft Seal Washer (O ring) fitted on Retainer makes the sealing perfect on reaching the level of 80% capacity. The present invention employs a rubber metal sealing which is a positive and perfect sealing whereas the sealing used in prior art is of metal to metal sealing, which cannot be perfectly leak proof.<br>
