				<td>A PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITION COMPRISING AN ACTIVE PRINCIPLE AND SULPHOBETAINE<br>
Field of the art<br>
The present invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition which comprises a non-detergent sulphobetaine (NDSB).<br>
State of the art<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions comprising active pharmaceutical ingredients are well known. The common pharmaceutical compositions described comprise various pharmaceutically acceptable excipients which with their different properties (e. g. stabilisation of the active pharmaceutical ingredient, adjustment and/or maintenance of the pH, effect on the solubility of the active pharmaceutical ingredient, maintenance of isotonicity of the pharmaceutical composition, etc.), enable usage of active pharmaceutical ingredients in the pharmaceutical compositions. Pharmaceutically acceptable excipients are extensively described; see e.g. Handbook of Pharmaceutical Excipients, Ainley Wade and Paul J. Weller, American Pharmaceutical Association, 1994.<br>
Therapeutically active proteins have also been described as active pharmaceutical ingredients in the pharmaceutical compositions. These pharmaceutical compositions also comprise various pharmaceutical excipients which - with their properties - enable preparation of stable pharmaceutical compositions comprising therapeutically active proteins. Such pharmaceutical compositions are extensively described; see e.g. Yu-Chang John Wang and Musetta A. Hanson (1988), J of Parenteral Science &amp; Technology, 42: S4-S26; Wong D. and Parasrampuria J. (1997), Biopharm: November 52-61.<br>
Stable pharmaceutical compositions comprising therapeutic protein granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) are disclosed in EP 373679 and described so as to stabilise primarily the G-CSF in solution with low conductivity and acid pH between 2.75 and 4.0. To improve stability, various sugars, amino acids, polymers and detergents were added. It has been particularly emphasized that pH of the G-CSF comprising composition should be less than 4 in order to reduce formation of aggregates and increase stability in this way. The formation of aggregates and<br><br>
reduced stability with a pH exceeding 4.0 are in accordance with the data from literature from the state of art (Kuzniar ef al. (2001), Pharm Dev Techno/6(3): 441-7; Bartkowski etal. (2002), J Protein Chem77 21(3):137-43; Narhi et al. (1991), J Prvtein Chem 10(4): 359-367; Wang W (1999), Int J Pharmaceut 185:129-188. G-CSF stability, described in other pharmaceutical compositions from patent and scientific literature, was achieved with addition of various stabilisers, such as e. g. sulphate ions (EP 1129720), mixture of various preservatives, amino acids and surfactants (EP 607156), various buffer systems (phosphate, citrate, arginine, acetate) in the presence of a surfactant (EP 674525), high molecular compounds, such as hydroxypropyl cellulose, polyethylene glycol, polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinylpirrolidone and others (GB 2193621), a surfactant (EP 1060746), various buffer systems (TRIS, HEPES, TRICINE) (EP 0988861), sugars, such as cellobiose, gentiobiose, isomaltose, raffinose, trehalose and others (EP 0674524), and one or more amino acids (EP 1197221, WO51629, EP 1260230 and EP 1329224, EP 0975335). Although low ionic strength is preferred in the G-CSF comprising pharmaceutical compositions, various surfactants and other stabilisers are used for G-CSF stabilisation in the majority of cases have been described to be used for G-CSF stabilisation. Moreover, various buffer systems have been used additionally in the majority of cases for the maintenance of pH. In the literature the use of non-detergent sulfobetaines (NDSBs) as solubilisers was described (used in high concentrations of around 1 M of the solution) by protein renaturations (Chong Y and Chen H. (2000), Biotechiques 29(6): 1166-7; Vuillard L ef al. (1995), Biochem J 305: 337-43; Vuillard L et al. (1995), Electrophoresis 16(3): 295-7; Vuillard L ef a/. (1998), Eur J Biochem 256: 128-135; Goldberg M E ef al. (1995), Folding &amp; Design 1: 21-27). There is an ongoing need to provide stabilised pharmaceutical compositions. A description of NDSBs in pharmaceutical compositions has not been found either in the scientific or in the patent literature.<br>

from1%to10%(m/v).<br>
The pharmaceutical composition of the present invention optionally further<br>
comprises one or more of pharmaceutically acceptable excipients.<br>
The pharmaceutically acceptable excipient is selected from the group consisting of metal cation scavengers (e.g. EDTA and similar chelators), solvents and free radical scavengers (e. g. DMSO), various acids (e. g. acetic acid, titanic, methanesulphonic, phosphoric, hydrochloric and other), various bases (e. g. NaOH or organic N bases, e. g. Good's buffers, such as TRIS, TES, HEPES), various buffer systems (e. g. acetic acid/acetate, glutaminic acid/glutamate, maleic acid/maleate, citric acid/citrate, phosphoric acid/phosphate, and others), various pharmaceutically acceptable excipients for the maintenance of isotonicity of the solution (e. g. inorganic salts, such as CaCI2 and NaCI), protein stabilisers, selected from the group consisting of surface active substances, such as: glycol and glycerol esters, macrogol esters and ethers, sorbitan derivatives or polysorbates (polysorbate 20, polysorbate 80), amino acids, poloxamers (Pluronic F68), polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), and other. Preferably, the pharmaceutically acceptable excipient is selected from the group consisting of EDTA and DMSO.<br>
The NDSB in the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention can be combined with one or more of the above mentioned pharmaceutically acceptable excipients.<br>
The term »stabilizer« as used herein, refers to a pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
excipient that may stabilize an active pharmaceutical ingredient (e. g. a protein<br>
e.g. G-CSF).<br>
The term »protein stabilizers as used herein, refers to a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable excipient that may stabilize a protein (e.g. G-CSF).<br>
The term »protein stabiiity« (e. g. G-CSF) as used herein refers to the<br>
maintenance of protein content (e. g. G-CSF), as well as to the maintenance of<br>
protein biological activity (e.g. G-CSF). The decrease of protein stability (e. g. of<br><br>
G-CSF) may be influenced, among others, by the following processes: protein adsorption to the container walls, denaturation or degradation of protein, as well as aggregate formation, for e. g. protein dimer (e. g. G-CSF dimer) and/or protein multimer (e.g. G-CSF multimer) and/or similar molecules with higher molecular mass. These processes may be the result of various factors, e.g. increased temperature, inappropriate containers, use of inappropriate protein stabilisers, light exposure, freezing/thawing, inappropriate manufacturing procedure and/or inappropriate storage.<br>
The pharmaceutical composition of the present invention may stabilize the protein (e. g. G-CSF) at temperatures above refrigerator temperature (2-8oC), and also at room temperature (i.e. below 25°C) and even higher temperatures (e.g. about 40°C).<br>
The pharmaceutical composition of the present invention may comprise only one pharmaceutically acceptable excipient, i. e. NDSB for protein stabilisation (e. g. G-CSF) and for maintenance of suitable pH of the solution. Accordingly, in a further aspect of the present invention a pharmaceutical composition is provided which comprises an active pharmaceutical ingredient (as outlined above) and a NDSB as the sole further excipient. NDSB in the pharmaceutical composition represents a protective molecule which stabilises protein and therefore stands for protein stabilisers which are used in other pharmaceutical compositions (e. g. sugars, amino acids and other), as well as a molecule which adjusts a suitable pH of the solution and in this way is used instead of acids (e. g. acetic, citric, methanesulphonic, phosphoric, hydrochloric acid and others), which are used for the adjustment of suitable pH of the solution in other pharmaceutical compositions. NDSBs can also maintain a suitable pH and therefore replace various buffer systems and/or their combinations used in other pharmaceutical compositions (e. g. acetic acid/acetate, glutaminic acid/glutamate, maleic acid/maleate, citric acid/citrate, phosphoric acid/phosphate, and other). In comparison to the use of two or more molecules with different functions, the use of one molecule with several different functions is better with regard to the economy of preparation, lower costs, as well as easier and quicker preparation of the<br><br>
pharmaceutical composition, and also for the patient himself, as concerns the intake of less additional substances into the body. The characteristics of NDSB present an additional advantage, for it is a simple molecule which is not sensitive to light, temperature, various oxidizing agents (e. g. air oxygen), hydrolysis, is not chemically reactive molecule, has the zwitterion nature in wide pH area, which means that the mechanism of interaction in wide pH range does not change substantially.<br>
An aspect of the present invention is use of a NDSB as a stabilizer in a<br>
pharmaceutical composition.<br>
An aspect of the present invention is use of a NDSB as a protein stabilizer in a<br>
pharmaceutical composition.<br>
An aspect of the present invention is use of a NDSB as a pH adjustment agent in a<br>
pharmaceutical composition.<br>
An aspect of the present invention is use of a NDSB as a buffering agent in a<br>
pharmaceutical composition.<br>
The preferred pharmaceutical composition of the present invention is a liquid pharmaceutical composition; this does not however, limit usage of NDSBs in lyophilised pharmaceutical protein-comprising compositions in the context of the present invention.<br>
The pharmaceutical composition of the present invention enables parenteral administration subcutaneously, intravenously or intramuscularly without reconstitution, dilution or additional prior preparation which could lead to a decrease of the activity of the active pharmaceutical ingredient, e.g. protein e.g. G-CSF and to additional technical problems at the time of administration.<br>
Preferably, the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention does not contain human serum proteins with which viral contamination is possible. In this way the probability of occurrence of various allergic reactions, which could be the result of administration of human serum albumins, is reduced. It is prepared in<br><br>
isotonic solution which is pharmaceutically acceptable and does not cause undesirable effects.<br>
In the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention, therapeutically effective amount of a protein corresponds to therapeutically effective amounts of protein that are present on the market In the case of use of G-CSF, therapeutically effective amount of G-CSF is selected from the range between 0.3 mg/ml and 1.2 mg/ml, which does not, however, limit the present invention.<br>
The pharmaceutical composition of the present invention can be used for preparation of medicaments (for treatment) and for treatment of diseases indicated for therapeutically effective proteins, enumerated above. The pharmaceutical composition of the present invention can also be used for the treatment of all diseases and for preparation of medicaments for treatment of all diseases for which G-CSF is indicated. The indicated diseases may be selected from the group consisting of: neutropenia and its clinical sequelae, reduced hospitalisation in febrile neutropenia after chemotherapy, mobilisation of hematopoietic germ cells, alternative infusion of donor leukocytes, chronic neutropenia, neutropenic and non-neutropenic infections, transplantation receivers, chronic inflammatory diseases, sepsis and septic shock, reduced risk, reduced morbidity, reduced mortality and reduced number of hospitalisation days in neutropenic and non-neutropenic infections, prevention of infections and complications of infections in neutropenic and non-neutropenic patients, prevention of nosocomial infections and reduced mortality and frequence of nosocomial infections, enteral application to newborn babies, enforcement of the neonate immune system, improvement of the clinical result in patients at intensive care unit and in critically ill patients, vaccination and management of burns, skin ulcers and lesions, intensification of chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy, pancytopenia, increase in anti-inflammatory cytokines, reduction of high dosage chemotherapy intervals with prophylactic use of G-CSF, potentiation of anti-tumor effects of photodynamic therapy, prevention and management of diseases caused by various cerebral dysfunctions, treatment of thrombotic diseases and their complications and post-radiation recovery of erythropoiesis.<br><br>
An aspect of the present invention is use of a NDSB for the preparation of a pharmaceutical composition.<br>
The pharmaceutical composition of the present invention can be filled in pharmaceutical packaging selected from the group consisting of ampoules, injection syringes and vials. This pharmaceutical packaging enables the application in volumes in the range from 0.2 ml to 2 ml (per dose). Furthermore, the object of the invention is also the process for preparation of the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention. The process for preparation of the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention comprises mixing of a NDSB with therapeutically effective amount of an active pharmaceutical ingredient (e.g. of protein, e. g. G-CSF)<br>

in J Pharm Biomed AnaI 13, 9-20 (1995)) and the use of international standard<br>
Human recombinant G-CSF (88/502, yeast cell derived; NIBSC Potters Bar,<br>
Hertfordshire, UK; see Mire-Sluis AR- et al. v J Immunol Methods 179,117-126<br>
(1995)<br>
Measurement of pH value<br>
pH is measured using MA 5741 (Iskra) pH meter and Biotrode (Hamilton)<br>
electrodes. The pH meter is calibrated to the pH range from 3.0 to 5.0 with suitable<br>
fresh calibration buffers. The pH is measured at a temperature 25°C. The standard<br>
deviation of the pH measurement is 0.003 of the pH value (0.3%).<br>
The conditions for testing the G-CSF stability in pharmaceutical compositions<br>
4 °C: stored in refrigerator at the refrigerator temperature (in the range from +4 °C<br>
to +6°C)<br>
40°C: stored at 40 °C ± 2°C 25°C: stored at room temperature between 25°C and 30°C in 1-ml filled syringes<br>
during shaking at 75 rpm on the shaker Vibromix 314EVT.<br>

■   Reference pharmaceutical composition:<br>
A (S16-10ACT):     0.3 mg/ml G-CSF, 10 mM acetic acid, 5% (m/v) sorbitol,<br>
0.004% Tween 80, pH adjusted to 4.0 with NaOH (identical to<br>
Neupogen).<br>
Samples with a G-CSF concentration of 0.6 mg/ml are stored at 40°C for 1 month. They are analysed using SE-HPLC; 6 \xg of G-CSF is loaded to the column. Figure 1 shows the respective results (AU = absorption unit). Legend of Figure 1:<br>

Results of stability tests<br>
The SE-HPLC analysis of the samples FP1 and FP2, stored for 1 month at 40°C, shows that the samples are stable as there are no visible increase in the content of aggregates and hydrophobic degradation products (Table 1, Figure 1). The stability is comparable to reference sample (AS16-10ACT) which are identical to<br><br>
the pharmaceutical composition comprising G-CSF, and available on the market (Neupogen, G-CSF = 0.3 mg/ml), Stability is also confirmed with RP-HPLC analyses which do not show essential changes in impurities or in the protein content after the storage period. These results comply with the results of the SDS-PAGE analysis (the results are not indicated) and the in vitro measurement of biological activity. The in vitro biological activity of G-CSF, which is used in the studies, is at the level of the international standard (Cat. no. 88/502; NIBSC, UK). The in vitro biological activity of the samples FP1 and FP2 does not change after storage under test conditions (the results are not shown). Table 1<br><br>
The results show that the stability of pharmaceutical compositions comprising NDSBs are comparable to the reference sample (AS16-10ACT). Higher NDSB concentrations reveal a more favourable effect on the stability. The SE-HPLC analysis of the samples from FP4 to FP11, stored at 25°C for 1 week and 1 month, shows that the samples are stable as there are no noticeable increase in the aggregate content and in hydrophobic degradation products (Table 2, Figure 2). Stability is comparable to that of the reference sample (AS16-10ACT), which is identical to G-CSF comprising pharmaceutical composition and which is present on the market (Neupogen, G-CSF = 0.3 mg/ml). Stability is also confirmed with the RP-HPLC analyses which do not show essential changes in the impurities or protein content after the storage period. These results comply with the results of the SDS-PAGE analysis (the results are not indicated) and measurement of the in vitro biological activity. The in vitro biological activity of G-CSF, which is used in the studies, is at the level of the international standard (Cat no. 88/502; NIBSC, UK). After storage under the study conditions, the in vitro<br><br>
biological activity of the samples from FP4 to FP11 is changed (the results are not<br>
shown).<br>
Table 2<br><br>
w: week, m: month; %: amount of dimer/higher aggregates with reference to the total amount of G-<br>
CSF;<br>
% polyo!: m/v.<br>
The results from Table 2 show that pharmaceutical compositions with the addition of NDSBs are stable. A slight reduction of stability with regard to the reference sample (Table 1) is noted in samples which are exposed to more extreme conditions (1 month, 40°C). It is also possible that a slight reduction of stability<br><br>
results from the fact that pH above 4.0 is not favourable for G-CSF, which is also evident from the state of the art. The reference sample is prepared using pH 4.0.<br>

Bulk concentrate preparation<br>
The starting material of G-CSF for the preparation of bulk concentrate is produced<br>
by the expression in £. coll.<br>
Bulk concentrate is prepared in solution with pure acid (acetic acid or HCI) at pH<br>
4.4 using the G-CSF concentration 1.5 mg/ml. The SE-HPLC analysis of the bulk<br>
concentrate shows that the content of dinners and of higher aggregates is below<br>
the detection limit. The assay of impurities, determined with the RP-HPLC<br>
analysis, is in the range 2-4%. (The RP-HPLC analysis of a fresh Neupogen<br>
sample shows a comparable amount of impurities).<br><br>
Quality of Substances<br>
NDSB: NDSB-195 (Calbiochem) for analysis, sorbitol: Ph. Eur. quality; glycerol:<br>
Merck; for analysis; inositol: rnyo-inositol (Fluka: &gt; 99.5% HPLC), trehalose (Fluka:<br>
&gt; 99.5% HPLC), EDTA (Sigma: 99%), DMSO (Merck: &gt; 99.5%), Tween 80 (Sigma,<br>
low peroxide level, contains BHT as an antioxidant); water for injection: Ph. Eur.<br>
quality; water for analysis: Milli-Q (Millipore).<br>
Preparation of reference pharmaceutical composition<br>
A (S16-10ACT): The fractions of the gel filtration which comprise the G-CSF<br>
monomer are pooled and substituted with buffer containing 10 mM of acetic acid<br>
and 5% of sorbitol in water for injection. pH of the buffer is adjusted with NaOH<br>
solution to 3.96. The substitution is performed on the Labscale ™ TFF<br>
System/Miilipore, using three Ultracel- 5 PLCCC membranes. Tween 80 is added<br>
until a concentration of 0.004% is obtained. pH of the final solution after<br>
substitution is 4.0, with concentration of 0.304 mg/ml.<br>
Preparation of inventive pharmaceutical compositions:<br>
General:<br>
The inventive pharmaceutical compositions are prepared with dilution of bulk<br>
concentrate with an adequate sterile buffer solution, previously filtered through a<br>
0.2 PES/Nalgene filter. The final G-CSF concentration is 0.3 mg/ml or 0.6 mg/ml,<br>
respectively.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions FP1 and FP2 are filled in 2 ml vials made of<br>
colourless glass, hydrolytictype I, washed, sterilised and closed with closures<br>
from brombutyl rubber, equipped with aluminium caps.<br>
Other pharmaceutical compositions (FP3 to FP11) are (manually) filled in the<br>
injection syringes (volume 1.3 - 1.4 ml) so that there is minimal amount of air<br>
around the closure.<br>
FP1, FP2, FP3: To 1 portion of the bulk concentrate 4 portions of the suitable<br>
buffer solution are added. Final concentrations indicated in Table 3 are obtained.<br>
pH is no longer adjusted.<br>
