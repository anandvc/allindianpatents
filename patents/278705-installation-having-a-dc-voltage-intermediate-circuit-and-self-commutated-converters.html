Installation having a DC voltage intermediate circuit and self- <br>
commutated converters<br>
The invention relates to a method for closed-loop control of at <br>
least two converters, which can be controlled as rectifiers or <br>
inverters and are connected to one another via a DC voltage <br>
link, in the field of power transmission and/or distribution, <br>
in which a measurement DC voltage (Udc_r1...Udc_rr; <br>
Udc_i1...Udc_ii) and a measurement direct current <br>
(Idc_r1...Idc_rr; Idc_i1...Idc_ii) are in each case measured at <br>
each converter and are transmitted to a rectifier regulator <br>
for closed-loop control of the respective rectifier, or are <br>
transmitted to an inverter regulator for closed-loop control of <br>
the respectively associated inverter, wherein each rectifier <br>
regulator and each inverter regulator in each case forms the <br>
difference between a predetermined nominal DC voltage (Udco) <br>
and the respectively received measurement DC voltage <br>
(Udc_r1...Udc_rr; Udc_i1...Udc_ii), producing a difference DC <br>
voltage (du) and, furthermore, the difference between a nominal <br>
direct current (Idco_r1...Idco_rr, Idco_i1...Idco_ii) and the <br>
respectively received measurement direct current <br>
(Idc_r1...Idc_rr; Idc_i1...Idc_ii) , producing a difference <br>
direct current (di), where the measurement direct current, the <br>
measurement DC voltage, the nominal direct current and the <br>
nominal DC voltage are in a normalized form.<br>
A method such as this is already known from WO 2007/033620 Al, <br>
which describes a closed-loop control method for high-voltage <br>
direct-current transmission in which electrical power is <br>
transmitted between AC voltage systems via a direct-current <br>
circuit. The high-voltage direct-current transmission (HVDCT) <br>
installation which is used<br>
<br>
<br>
for power transmission consists of a rectifier and an inverter, <br>
which are connected to one another via a direct current link. <br>
Transformers are provided in order to couple the converters to <br>
the respectively associated AC voltage system. For closed-loop <br>
control of the rectifier or inverter, a measurement DC voltage <br>
Udc_r or Udc_i, and a respective measurement direct current, <br>
Idc_r or Idc_i respectively, are recorded and are transmitted <br>
to the respective closed-loop control system both at the <br>
rectifier and at the inverter. A nominal DC voltage Udco and a <br>
nominal direct current Idco are determined from the <br>
predetermined power which is intended to be transmitted, with <br>
the aid of a function transmitter. The difference DC voltage du <br>
is then calculated from the difference between the nominal DC <br>
voltage Udco and the measurement DC voltage Udc_r, Udc_i. The <br>
difference direct current di is correspondingly formed from the <br>
difference between the nominal direct current Idco and the <br>
respectively determined measurement direct current Idc_r and <br>
Idc_i. All the values are in this case in normalized form, with <br>
the normalization process being carried out, for example, with <br>
respect to a rated DC voltage and a rated direct current, or <br>
else with respect to a nominal direct current and the nominal <br>
DC voltage. The rectifier regulator now controls the rectifier <br>
in such a way that the sum of the difference DC voltage du and <br>
of the difference direct current di is a minimum. The inverter <br>
regulator in contrast controls the inverter such that the <br>
difference between the difference direct current di and the <br>
difference DC voltage du is a minimum. The already known <br>
methods are, however, suitable only for so-called externally <br>
commutated converters, in which, for example, thyristors are <br>
used which cannot be turned off by means of trigger signals. <br>
Converters such as these allow current to flow in only one <br>
direction in the direct current circuit. The power flow can be <br>
reversed only by reversing the polarity of the voltage across <br>
the respective converter. Furthermore,<br>
<br>
<br>
in this installation, which is referred to in the following <br>
text as a traditional HVDCT installation, the operating current <br>
must always be greater than 0.05 p.u., because of the need to <br>
avoid intermittent currents in the current nominal value. This <br>
allows the abovementioned normalization with respect to the <br>
nominal values.<br>
As a result of the progressive improvement in the field of <br>
power electronics, it has become possible to also use power <br>
semiconductors which can be turned off, for example IGBTs or <br>
GTOs, for converters in the field of power transmission, and in <br>
particular for HVDCT. A converter such as this, which is also <br>
called a voltage source converter (VSC), is connected to a <br>
further VSC via a DC voltage intermediate circuit. Each power <br>
semiconductor which can be turned off in the converter has a <br>
freewheeling diode connected in parallel with it. The power <br>
flow is no longer reversed by reversing the polarity of the <br>
voltage on the respective VSC but by reversing the current <br>
flowing via the respective VSC. Furthermore, direct current <br>
nominal values equal to zero can be used for the respective <br>
VSC. It is therefore impossible to use the method of this <br>
generic type for controlling a VSC in an HVDCT installation.<br>
WO 2007/033619 A1 discloses a closed-loop control method for <br>
direct current transmission having a plurality of converters, <br>
in which the method mentioned above is likewise used. In this <br>
case as well, nominal currents of more than 0.05 p.u. are <br>
required, in particular at the rectifier, in order to avoid <br>
intermittent currents.<br>
The object of the invention is to provide a method of the type <br>
mentioned initially, which allows closed-loop control to be <br>
carried out for converters which have power semiconductors <br>
which can be turned off and are connected to one another via a <br>
DC voltage intermediate circuit.<br>
<br>
<br>
while at the same time making it possible to preset nominal <br>
currents equal to zero.<br>
The invention achieves this object in that each converter is a <br>
self-commutated converter (1) having power semiconductors which <br>
can be turned off, and the rectifier regulator controls the <br>
respectively associated converter such that the sum of the <br>
product of the difference DC voltage (du) and the magnitude of <br>
the nominal direct current (|Idco_r|), which is provided at the <br>
respectively associated rectifier, and the difference direct <br>
current (di) is a minimum (du*|Idco_r|+di—&gt;Min) and the <br>
inverter regulator controls the respectively associated <br>
converter such that the sum between the difference DC voltage <br>
(du) and the difference direct current (di) is a minimum <br>
(du+di—&gt;Min).<br>
The invention transfers the closed-loop control method known <br>
from traditional HVDCT to HVDCT installations in which VSCs and <br>
a DC voltage intermediate circuit are used. In the case of <br>
these so-called voltage source converters (VSC), the voltage <br>
polarity can no longer be reversed because of the DC voltage <br>
intermediate circuit, by which means the power flow is reversed <br>
in a conventional HVDCT. In converters (VSCs) such as these, <br>
the power flow is reversed by reversing the current flow. These <br>
physical differences are taken into account in the closed-loop <br>
control method according to the invention. Furthermore, the <br>
method according to the invention also makes it possible to <br>
preset nominal currents with a value of zero. This was <br>
impossible in the case of the known closed-loop control methods <br>
for conventional HVDCT. The method according to the invention <br>
therefore provides simple and flexible closed-loop control for <br>
two or more VSCs which are connected to one another via a DC <br>
voltage link.<br>
<br>
<br>
The DC voltage link has a polarity which does not change during <br>
operation of the HVDCT installation, within the scope of the <br>
invention, even when the power flow is reversed. In this case, <br>
for example, the DC voltage link is a bipolar DC voltage link <br>
which extends between two converters. According to this <br>
variant, the HVDCT installation to be controlled consists of a <br>
rectifier, which is connected via an inductance, for example a <br>
transformer, to an AC voltage system which provides power. The <br>
inverter, which is connected to said rectifier via the bipolar <br>
DC voltage link, is likewise connected via an inductance, for <br>
example a transformer, to a second AC voltage system, which, <br>
for example, has the loads to be supplied. However, in contrast <br>
to this, a plurality of converters can also be controlled using <br>
the method according to the invention, wherein the converters, <br>
or in this case the VSCs, are connected to one another via a DC <br>
voltage link with any desired topology. The method according to <br>
the invention is completely independent of the topology of the <br>
DC voltage link.<br>
Expediently, the nominal DC voltage Udco of each rectifier <br>
regulator and the nominal DC voltage Udco of each inverter <br>
regulator are identical. Complex definition of the nominal DC <br>
voltage at each converter station, with rapid and reliable <br>
telecommunication for signaling the respective nominal DC <br>
voltage to other stations, has therefore become superfluous <br>
within the scope of the invention.<br>
Expediently, the converters are at a distance of at least <br>
1 kilometer from one another. All HVDCT installations which use <br>
the so-called back-to-back configuration, in which inverters <br>
and converters are installed physically alongside one another <br>
and are used only for coupling different AC voltage systems in <br>
a manner which can be subjected to closed-loop control,<br>
<br>
<br>
are excluded from this expedient further development. The <br>
apparatus for which the method according to this advantageous <br>
further development is designed is therefore used to transmit <br>
electrical power over a relatively long distance.<br>
Advantageously, each measurement DC voltage Udc_rr or Udc_ii <br>
and the nominal DC voltage Udco are normalized with respect to <br>
the nominal DC voltage Udco. This allows stable closed-loop <br>
control, in particular when the power levels to be transmitted <br>
are low. This normalization, which is already known from <br>
conventional HVDCT, is, however, carried out for the purposes <br>
of the exemplary embodiment according to the invention only in <br>
conjunction with the respective measurement and nominal DC <br>
voltage. In contrast, the nominal direct current is not <br>
normalized, in order to allow the use of nominal direct <br>
currents equal to zero in this expedient further development of <br>
the invention as well.<br>
Advantageously, two converters are provided, one of which is <br>
operated as a rectifier and the other converter is operated as <br>
an inverter, wherein a DC voltage intermediate circuit extends <br>
between the rectifier and the inverter. According to this <br>
refinement, the method is used for an HVDCT installation with <br>
VSCs and a DC voltage intermediate circuit without any <br>
branches. For example, the DC voltage intermediate circuit is <br>
designed with one pole, using the ground as the return <br>
conductor. In contrast to this, the DC voltage link has two <br>
poles, with the positive pole and negative pole of the DC <br>
voltage link being in the form of cable conductors.<br>
According to one refinement, which differs from this, the <br>
method according to the invention is provided for at least <br>
three converters, between which a DC voltage system extends.<br>
<br>
<br>
The DC voltage system may have any desired topology.<br>
According to one expedient further development in this context, <br>
a respectively associated rectifier nominal DC power <br>
(Pdco_r1...Pdco_rr) or inverter nominal DC power <br>
(Pdco_i1...Pdco_ii) is in each case defined for each rectifier <br>
regulator and for each inverter regulator, respectively, <br>
wherein the sum of all the rectifier nominal DC powers and all <br>
the inverter nominal DC powers is equal to zero. By way of <br>
example, the respective nominal DC power levels are defined by <br>
a central control center and are transmitted from there to the <br>
respective converter regulators. There is no need whatsoever <br>
for a powerful communication link for transmission, for example <br>
as is the case with a conventional HVDCT. For the purposes of <br>
the invention, it is sufficient to transmit the respective <br>
nominal DC power levels via the Internet, or any other simple, <br>
and therefore cost-effective, form of telecommunication to the <br>
respective regulator.<br>
Expediently, the nominal direct current respectively associated <br>
with the converter is determined at each converter from the <br>
nominal DC power associated with it and from the nominal DC <br>
voltage, which is common to all of them. According to this <br>
advantageous further development, the method according to the <br>
invention is simple and clear.<br>
Expediently, the closed-loop control of each rectifier and each <br>
inverter is carried out over the entire operating range of the <br>
rectifier or of the inverter both on the basis of the <br>
respectively associated rectifier difference direct current <br>
(di_r1...di_rr) and on the basis of the rectifier difference DC <br>
voltage (du_r1...du_rr) and, respectively, on the basis of the <br>
respectively<br>
<br>
<br>
associated inverter difference direct current (di_r1...di_rr) <br>
and on the basis of the associated inverter difference DC <br>
voltage (du_i1...du_ii).<br>
Advantageously, a respective measurement DC voltage <br>
(Udc_r1...Udc_rr; Udc_i1...Udc_ii) and a respective measurement <br>
direct current (Idc_r1...Idc_rr; Idc_i1...Idc_ii) are measured <br>
at each converter and are transmitted to a rectifier regulator <br>
or to an inverter regulator.<br>
According to one expedient further development in this context, <br>
a number of converters are controlled such that a direct <br>
current which flows through an isolating switch which is <br>
arranged in the DC voltage link is equal to zero. According to <br>
this advantageous further development, simple isolating <br>
switches can be used in the DC voltage link, since switching <br>
can always take place when no current is flowing. Complex <br>
resonant circuits which apply a zero crossing to the current by <br>
means of the switch, thus extinguishing any arc which is struck <br>
on switching, have likewise been rendered superfluous by this <br>
advantageous refinement of the invention.<br>
According to one modification in this context, at least one <br>
converter controls the respective measurement direct current <br>
recorded at it at zero, and at least one isolating switch, <br>
which is arranged in the DC voltage link, is then opened. Zero <br>
current regulation is carried out by using a nominal direct <br>
current equal to zero. According to one preferred refinement of <br>
this further development, all the converters which are <br>
connected to one another by a DC voltage link are controlled to <br>
zero. In other words, a nominal direct current zero is used for <br>
each regulator.<br>
<br>
<br>
According to one expedient further development in this context, <br>
a switching-off time is set and is transmitted to the <br>
respectively affected regulators, wherein said regulators <br>
control the measurement direct current associated with them to <br>
be zero when the switching-off time is reached. According to <br>
this expedient further development, all the regulator units <br>
have a time signal transmitter, for example an accurate clock, <br>
which provides a common, or substantially common, time signal <br>
for all the regulators. This time signal is compared with the <br>
set and transmitted switching-off time. If the difference <br>
between the switching-off time and the measured time is less <br>
than a threshold value set in advance, that is to say when the <br>
switching-off time is reached, the respective regulating unit <br>
presets a nominal direct current of zero, such that the <br>
measurement direct current is controlled at zero. This <br>
refinement ensures that all the affected regulators which, for <br>
example, are selected as such by a central control station, or <br>
all the regulators, are transferred to zero-current control at <br>
the same time.<br>
According to one expedient further development in this context, <br>
the measurement direct current is controlled to be zero by each <br>
affected converter over a zero-current time period, and the <br>
normal closed-loop control method is then restarted, that is to <br>
say once the zero-current time period has elapsed. Within the <br>
zero-current time period which, for example, is in the region <br>
of a few milliseconds, the desired isolating switch or switches <br>
in the DC voltage link is or are now opened. This makes it <br>
possible, in a simple manner, to deliberately disconnect an <br>
area or a converter from the DC voltage system with any desired <br>
topology, without likewise having to interrupt the power <br>
transmission via those links or converters which have not been <br>
turned off. In fact, within the scope of the invention, it is <br>
possible<br>
<br>
<br>
to disconnect a section of the DC voltage link or a converter <br>
specifically from the DC voltage system by rapidly reducing the <br>
direct current. The normal closed-loop control of the HVDCT <br>
installation is then started again. The closed-loop control <br>
method according to the invention then automatically approaches <br>
the regulator operating points required for this purpose, <br>
without any knowledge of the new topology of the DC voltage <br>
link. Complex data transmissions, calculations or the like have <br>
become superfluous as a result of the invention.<br>
Further expedient refinements and advantages of the invention <br>
are the subject matter of the following description of <br>
exemplary embodiments of the invention, with reference to the <br>
figures of the drawing, in which the same reference symbols <br>
refer to components having the same effect, and in which:<br>
Figure 1 shows an HVDCT installation having a plurality<br>
of voltage source converters, which are<br>
connected to one another via a DC voltage <br>
system,<br>
Figure 2 shows parameters and controlled variables used <br>
by one exemplary embodiment of the closed-loop <br>
control method according to the invention,<br>
Figure 3 shows one exemplary embodiment of the method <br>
according to the invention for a plurality of <br>
VSCs, which are linked to one another via a DC <br>
voltage system, and<br>
Figure 4 shows one exemplary embodiment of the method <br>
according to the invention, in which one <br>
specific section of the DC voltage link<br>
<br>
<br>
is disconnected from the DC voltage system by <br>
means of a single isolating switch.<br>
Figure 1 schematically illustrates an HVDCT installation having <br>
a multiplicity of converters 1, which are each connected via a <br>
transformer 2 to an AC voltage system 3. Each converter 1 is a <br>
so-called voltage source converter (VSC), having power <br>
semiconductors which can be turned off, such as IGBTs or GTOs, <br>
each of which has a freewheeling diode connected back-to-back <br>
in parallel with it. In this case, each converter 1 is <br>
connected to a DC voltage system 4 as a DC voltage link, which <br>
DC voltage system 4 may have any desired topology. Furthermore, <br>
each VSC 1 has an associated smoothing inductor 5. A VSC 1, a <br>
transformer 2, and a smoothing inductor 5 are part of a <br>
rectifier station or inverter station, depending on how the <br>
respective VSC is controlled by the regulating unit or <br>
regulator, which is not illustrated in the figure. In Figure 1, <br>
those rectifier stations which have VSCs operated at rectifiers <br>
are annotated r1, r2, r3 ... rr, whereas those inverter <br>
stations with VSCs which are operated as inverters are <br>
annotated i1, i2, i3 ... ii. Figure 1 also shows that each <br>
converter station rr and each inverter station ii has sensors <br>
for recording the measurement DC voltage Udc_rr at this station <br>
as well as the direct current Idc_rr or Idc_ii flowing there at <br>
the VSC 1. As can likewise been seen from Figure 1, the <br>
respective AC voltage systems 3 are also connected to one <br>
another via AC voltage links 6. The alternating current link 6 <br>
does not adversely affect the method according to the invention <br>
for closed-loop control of the VSC.<br>
Figure 2 is a graph, in which the normalized direct current is <br>
shown on the abscissa and the normalized DC voltage is shown on<br>
<br>
<br>
the ordinate. This is based on the assumption that, in contrast <br>
to the illustration in Figure 1, only one rectifier is <br>
connected via a DC voltage intermediate circuit to a VSC <br>
operating as an inverter.<br>
In the graph, the parameters and controlled variables of the <br>
rectifier are shown in the left-hand quadrant of the graph, and <br>
corresponding variables for the inverter are shown in the <br>
right-hand quadrant. The measurement direct current and the <br>
measurement DC voltage at the measurement point X_r are plotted <br>
on the rectifier side, whose measured and nominal values are <br>
annotated _r. The measurement DC voltage Udc_r is therefore <br>
greater than the nominal DC voltage Udco or Udco_r. If the <br>
difference DC voltage du_r is formed and normalized with <br>
respect to the nominal DC voltage Udco, this results in<br>
 . This value must be less than zero for power <br>
to <br>
be transmitted to the inverter.<br>
The nominal direct current Idco_r of the rectifier is, by- <br>
definition, negative, as a result of which: Idco_r=-Idco. The <br>
difference direct current di, which is formed from the <br>
difference between the nominal and the measurement direct <br>
current, is then given by: di_r=-Idco_r+Idc_r. This is not <br>
normalized with respect to the nominal direct current Idco_r, <br>
in order to allow a nominal direct current of zero for closed- <br>
loop control. The closed-loop control is now carried out by <br>
minimizing the rectifier control error de_r=du_r*|Idco_r|+di_r <br>
being, that is to say becoming zero. The straight line shown on <br>
the left is therefore a tangent to the hyperbola which is shown <br>
by a dashed line and represents the invariant nominal DC power <br>
Pdco_r=-Pdco. Since the difference DC voltage du_r is <br>
multiplied by the magnitude of the nominal direct current <br>
|Idco_r| in order to calculate the control error de_r, this<br>
<br>
<br>
results in a stable, rapidly active control response of the <br>
rectifier, because the closed-loop voltage control is <br>
suppressed when the nominal direct currents are small. Closed- <br>
loop voltage and current control are carried out, <br>
simultaneously and in a substantially equivalent form to one <br>
another, only for higher nominal direct currents Idco_r.<br>
The measurement direct current Idc_i and the measurement DC <br>
voltage Udc_i at the operating point X_i are plotted on the <br>
inverter side. As on the rectifier side, the difference DC <br>
voltage du_i and the difference direct current di_i are <br>
calculated, with the difference voltage du_i once again being <br>
normalized with respect to the nominal DC voltage Udco. du_i <br>
must be greater than zero for the desired power transmission. <br>
Normalization with respect to the nominal direct current in <br>
order to form the difference direct current di_i is also not <br>
carried out in this case. It is therefore also possible to <br>
preset nominal DC currents Idco_i equal to 0. For the desired <br>
power transmission, the difference direct current di_i is less <br>
than zero. The control error de_i is formed from the sum of the <br>
difference DC voltage du_i and the difference direct current <br>
di_i. The closed-loop control now attempts to minimize the <br>
control error de_i to be zero. On the graph shown in Figure 2, <br>
this results in a straight line which intersects the hyperbola <br>
of the invariant DC power Pdco_i at the point W_i. The straight <br>
line de_i is reminiscent of the response of a pure resistance, <br>
as a result of which the inverter regulator can also be <br>
referred to as a resistance regulator.<br>
Figure 3 schematically illustrates one exemplary embodiment of <br>
the method according to the invention for an HVDCT installation <br>
as shown in Figure 1, in which the parameters and variables <br>
shown in Figure 2 are used for a rectifier regulator 7_r1 for <br>
the rectifier station r_1, and for an inverter regulator 8_i1 <br>
for the inverter station i1. The rectifier regulators 7_rr,<br>
<br>
<br>
which are not shown in the figure, and the inverter regulator <br>
8_ii, which is not illustrated, are physically identical.<br>
As can be seen from Figure 3, the rectifier regulator 7_r1, and <br>
therefore each rectifier regulator, receives a nominal DC power <br>
Pdco_r1 assigned to it. A corresponding situation applies to <br>
the inverter regulator 8_i1, in which case the respectively <br>
associated nominal DC power is transmitted from a central <br>
control station to the respective stations via communication <br>
links which are not shown, for example a simple radio link. In <br>
this case, the sum of all the nominal DC powers is equal to <br>
zero: ?Pdco_rr+?Pdco_ii=0. The invention makes complex, rapid <br>
and reliable transmission, as is the case for conventional <br>
HVDCT, superfluous.<br>
The received nominal DC power Pdco_r1 and Pdco_i1 is in each <br>
case supplied to a divisor 9, to whose second input the nominal <br>
DC voltage Udco, which is the same for all the stations, is <br>
applied. By way of example, the nominal DC power is likewise <br>
transmitted from a central station. The divider 9 forms the <br>
quotient of the respective nominal DC power Pdco and the <br>
nominal DC voltage Udco, producing the nominal direct current <br>
Idco_r1 or Idco_i1, with the respective nominal direct current <br>
being supplied to a limiter 10, which limits the nominal direct <br>
current Idco_r1 or Idco_i1 to a respective minimum nominal <br>
direct current Imin_r1,Imin_i1 and a respective maximum <br>
nominal direct current Imax_r1,Imax_i1. The nominal direct <br>
current Idco_r1 or Idco_i1 is then supplied to an adder 11, <br>
which in each case forms the difference from the nominal direct <br>
current Idco_r1 or Idco_i1 and the measurement direct current <br>
Idco_r1 or Idco_i1. The difference direct current di_r1 <br>
obtained in this way is then supplied to a further adder 11. <br>
The value at the second<br>
<br>
<br>
input of said adder 11 is derived from the measured voltage and <br>
the nominal voltage. For this purpose, the divisor 12 in each <br>
case determines the quotient of the measurement DC voltage <br>
Udc_r1 or Udc_i1 and the nominal DC voltage Udco. The <br>
measurement DC voltage Udc_r1 or Udc_i1 which have been <br>
normalized in this way is then subtracted from 1, producing the <br>
respective difference DC voltage du_r1 or du_i1. As stated <br>
above, for the inverter regulator 8_il, the difference DC <br>
voltage du_i1 obtained in this way is supplied to the second <br>
input of the adder 11 which, by addition of its inputs, <br>
calculates the inverter control error de_i, which is then <br>
supplied to a regulator 13.<br>
In contrast to the inverter regulator 8_i1, in the case of the <br>
rectifier regulator 7_r1,the difference DC voltage du_r1 is <br>
multiplied by the magnitude of the nominal direct current <br>
|Idco_r1|. An absolute-value generator 23 is provided in order <br>
to form the magnitude |Idco_r1| from Idco_r1,with the product <br>
|Idco_r1| * du_r1 being formed by means of a multiplier 24. In <br>
the case of the rectifier regulator 7_r1,the difference direct <br>
current di_r1 is added to said product of du_r1 and |Idco_r1| <br>
by means of the adder 11, in order to produce the control error <br>
de_r of the rectifier. The control error of the rectifier de_r1 <br>
is then supplied to the regulator 13 and, finally, to a module <br>
management system 14, which in this case provides open-loop <br>
control for the power semiconductors in the respective VSCs.<br>
The VSCs illustrated in Figure 3 are so-called multilevel VSCs <br>
which, like all VSCs, consist of a bridge circuit of electrical <br>
valves. However, in the case of multilevel VSCs, each <br>
electrical valve is formed from a series circuit of bipolar <br>
submodules which each have an energy store and, in parallel <br>
with the energy store, a circuit composed of<br>
<br>
<br>
power semiconductors, such that the voltage across the energy <br>
store, or else a zero voltage, is dropped across the respective <br>
submodule depending on the operation of the power <br>
semiconductors. The voltage which is dropped in total across <br>
the electrical valves is additively composed of the output <br>
voltages of the submodules, and can therefore be changed in <br>
steps.<br>
In order to operate the power semiconductors in the submodules, <br>
the output of the regulator 13 is connected to the input of the <br>
so-called module management system, whose detailed <br>
configuration will not be described for the purposes of the <br>
invention, since it is not essential to the invention. The <br>
module management system operates the power semiconductors in <br>
the submodules corresponding to the output of the regulator 13. <br>
However, within the scope of the invention, it is also possible <br>
for the regulator 13 to be followed by a pulse width modulator <br>
rather than by a module management system, which pulse width <br>
modulator is designed for open-loop control of two-stage or <br>
three-stage voltage source converters.<br>
Figure 4 likewise shows an HVDCT installation, in order to <br>
illustrate one exemplary embodiment of the method according to <br>
the invention. In this case as well, a plurality of rectifier <br>
stations r1, r2,...rr and a plurality of inverter stations i1, <br>
i2...ii are once again connected to one another via a DC <br>
voltage system 4 of any desired topology. In addition to the <br>
illustration shown in Figures 3 and 1, each rectifier station <br>
rr and each inverter station ii has a protection unit 15 in <br>
addition to a rectifier regulator 7_rr or inverter regulator <br>
8_ii, respectively, which protection unit 15 is connected to <br>
the respective rectifier regulator 7_rr or inverter regulator <br>
8_ii. The respective rectifier regulator 7_rr or inverter <br>
regulator 8_ii is also in each case connected to a protection <br>
device 16 of a circuit breaker 17, with the switch 17 being <br>
arranged between the AC<br>
<br>
<br>
voltage system 3 and the transformer 2 . In the event of a <br>
fault, for example high short-circuit currents, it is possible <br>
to disconnect each VSC from the respective AC system 3 by means <br>
of the multi-pole switch 17 on the AC voltage side which, for <br>
example, is a circuit breaker for switching high short-circuit <br>
currents. In this case, protection tripping takes place via the <br>
protection unit 15, which causes the respective regulating unit <br>
7 to emit a tripping command to the protection device 16. The <br>
protection device 16 opens the circuit breaker 17 when a <br>
tripping command occurs.<br>
In order to allow DC voltage sections 18 to also be turned off <br>
or disconnected within the DC voltage link 4, DC voltages <br>
switches 19 are arranged in the DC voltage links. A DC voltage <br>
protection unit 2 0 is used to trip the DC voltage switch or <br>
switches 19 and is connected to the output of a DC voltage <br>
current sensor 21, which produces direct current values Idc_bl <br>
or Idc_b2, corresponding to the direct current flow via the <br>
respective switch 19. The DC voltage protection unit 2 0 is in <br>
turn connected to the protection device 16 for the DC voltage <br>
switch 19.<br>
The arrow 22 shown in Figure 4 indicates a ground fault, as a <br>
result of which high short-circuit currents flow in the DC <br>
voltage section 18. If the direct current values Idc_bl and <br>
Idc_b2 which are supplied to the respective DC voltage <br>
protection unit 2 0 exceed a previously defined threshold value, <br>
or some other criterion, the respective DC voltage protection <br>
unit 20 defines a switching-off time toff in the near future, <br>
and transmits the switching-of f time toff to the respective <br>
rectifier regulator 7_r1,7_r2, 7_rr or inverter regulator <br>
8_i1, 8_i2, 8_ii. These regulators are connected to a timer, <br>
such that<br>
<br>
<br>
all the regulators can determine that the switching-off time <br>
has been reached, approximately at the same time. The <br>
protection unit 15 now operates the respective regulating unit <br>
such that this in each case sets the respective nominal direct <br>
current Idco_r1,Idco_r2, Idco_rr or Idco_i1, Idco_i2 and <br>
Idco_ii to zero throughout a zero-current time period, such <br>
that the respective measurement direct current is controlled at <br>
zero. Therefore, the respective direct current Idc_b1 or Idc_b2 <br>
flowing through the direct current switches 19 is also equal to <br>
zero. The switch 19 can now be opened with no current flowing. <br>
The DC voltage protection unit 20 likewise identifies that the <br>
switching-off time has been reached, by time comparison. After <br>
a safety time interval has passed, which is shorter than a <br>
zero-current time period, the DC voltage switch 19 is opened <br>
with no current flowing, thus disconnecting the DC voltage <br>
section 18. The normal closed-loop control method is started <br>
again once the zero-current time period has elapsed. For the <br>
purposes of the invention, the respective regulators need not <br>
be informed of the change in the topology of the DC voltage <br>
link 4. The closed-loop control system automatically changes to <br>
stable closed-loop control points without any further <br>
additional effects. This allows the DC voltage system 4 to be <br>
switched with little complexity. The invention renders parallel <br>
resonant circuits, as used for DC voltage switches according to <br>
the prior art, superfluous.<br>
<br>
<br>

The invention relates to a method for regulating at least two inverters (1),<br>
which may be regulated either as rectifier or inverter, connected to each<br>

a measured DC voltage (Udc_rl... Udc_rr; Udc_il... Udc_ii) and a measured<br>
