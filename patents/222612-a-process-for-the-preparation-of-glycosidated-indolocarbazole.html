This invention relates to A Process for the Preparation of Glycosidated Indolocarbazole.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a novel glycosidation process to make intermediates useful in the preparation of indolopyrrolocarbazole derivatives which inhibit the growth of tumor cells and are therefore useful in the treatment of cancer in mammals, and the like.<br>
In the field of cancer chemotherapy, a large number of compounds have already been put to practical use as antitumor agents. However, a need continues for the development of more efficacious compounds that work against<br>
a variety of tumors (see the Proceedings of the 47th General Meeting of the Japan Cancer Society, pp. 12-15 (1988)). This need has led to the development of indolocarbazole derivatives. (See U.S. Patent Nos. 4,487,925; 4,552,842; 4,785,085; 5,591,842 and 5,922,860; Japanese Patent No. 20277/91; Journal of Antibiotics, Vol. 44, pp. 723-728 (1991); WO91/18003; WO 98/07433; and EP0545195 Al.) These compounds have been shown to act as topoisomerase inhibitors and therefore useful in the treatment of cancer (Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 34 (suppl): S41-S45 (1994)).<br>
The success of these compounds in treating numerous cancers has necessitated the development of improved methods for their syntheses. (See Bioorg. &amp; Med. Chem. Letters 2000, 70,419; Tetrahedron 1997, 53, 5937; Tetrahedron 1997, 53, 585; and Synthesis 1976, 414.) The previously known methods, however, suffer from numerous problems, including the use of undesirable solvents, mercury or silver salts, low yields and formation of unwanted side-products necessitating tedious or protracted purification steps.<br>
An object of this invention therefore is to provide a novel route to intermediates useful in the preparation of indolopyrrolocarbazole-derived antitumor substances while overcoming the problems inherent in the previously known syntheses.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>

The compounds of the present invention may have asymmetric centers, chiral axes, and chiral planes (as described in: E.L. Eliel and S.H. Wilen, Stereochemistry of Carbon Compounds, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, 1994, pages 1119-1190), and occur as racemates, racemic mixtures, and as individual diastereomers, with all possible isomers and mixtures thereof, including optical isomers, being included in the present invention. In addition, the compounds disclosed herein may exist as tautomers and both tautomeric forms are intended<br>
to be encompassed by the scope of the invention, even though only one tautomeric structure is depicted.<br>
When any variable (e.g. Xl, X2, R8, R9 etc) occurs more than one time in any constituent, its definition on each occurrence is independent at every<br><br>
other occurrence.  Also, combinations of substituents and variables are permissible only if such combinations result in stable compounds. Lines drawn into the ring systems from substituents indicate that the indicated bond may be attached to any of the substitutable ring carbon atoms. If the ring system is polycyclic, it is intended that the bond be attached to any of the suitable carbon atoms on the proximal ring only.<br>
It is understood that substituents and substitution patterns on the compounds of the instant invention can be selected by one of ordinary skill in the art to provide compounds that are chemically stable and that can be readily synthesized by techniques known in the art, as well as those methods set forth below, from readily available starting materials.<br>
As used herein, "alkyl" is intended to include both branched, straight-chain, and cyclic saturated aliphatic hydrocarbon groups having the specified number of carbon atoms.  For example, C1-C6, as in "C1-C6 alkyl" is defined to include groups<br>
having 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 carbons in a linear, branched, or cyclic arrangement. For example, "C1-C6 alkyl" specifically includes methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl, hexyl,<br>
and   so   on,   as   well   as   cycloalkyls   such   as   cyclopropyl,   methylcyclopropyl, dimethylcyclobutyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, and cyclohexyl, and so on.    The alkyl sbstituents may be unsubstituted or substituted with one to three substituents selected from halogen, C1-C6 alkyl, OH, OC1-C6 alkyl, 0(C=O)C1-C6 alkyl, 0(C=O) OC1-C6 alkyl, amino, amido, CO2H, CN, NO2, N3, C1-C6 perflouroalkyl, and OC1-C6 perflouroalkyl. "Alkoxy" represents an alkyl group of indicated number<br>
of carbon atoms attached through an oxygen bridge.<br>
The term "alkenyl" refers to a non-aromatic hydrocarbon radical, straight, branched or cyclic, containing from 2 to 10 carbon atoms and at least one carbon to carbon double bond. Preferably one carbon to carbon double bond is present, and up to four non-aromatic carbon-carbon double bonds may be present. Thus, "C2-C6 alkenyl"<br>
means an alkenyl radical having from 2 to 6 carbon atoms. Alkenyl groups include ethenyl, propenyl, butenyl, 2-methylbutenyl and cyclohexenyl. The straight, branched or cyclic portion of the alkenyl group may contain double bonds and may be substituted if a substituted alkenyl group is indicated.<br>
In certain instances, substituents may be defined with a range of carbons that includes zero, such as (C0-C6)alkylene-NR5R6. If R5 and R6 are<br><br>
taken as H in this case, this definition would include NH2, as well as -CH2NH2,<br>
-CH2CH2NH2, CH(CH3)CH2CH(CH3)NH2, -CH2CH(NH2)CH3, and so on.    It is<br>
intended in these cases that the substituent on the bivalent radical can be attached at any point and not limited to the terminal position.<br>
As used herein, "aryl" is intended to mean substituted and unsubstituted phenyl or naphthyl. If substituted, it may be substituted with one to three substituents selected from halogen, C1-C6 alkyl, OH, OC1-C6 alkyl, 0(C=O)Ci-<br>
C6 alkyl, 0(C=O)0C1-C6 alkyl, amino, amido, CO2H, CN, NO2,<br>
N3, C1-C6 perflouroalkyl, and OC1-C6 perflouroalkyl.<br>
As appreciated by those of skill in the art, "halo" or "halogen" as used herein is intended to include chloro, fluoro, bromo and iodo.<br>
When definitions such as "(Cl-C8 alkyl)-(R7)2" are used, it is intended<br>
that the variable R7 be attached at any point along the alkyl moiety. Therefore, if R7 is defined as OH in this case, the definition would include the following: CH2OH,<br>
CH2CH2OH, CH(CH3)CH(OH)CH3, CH(CH3)CH(0H)<br>
CH2-CH(OH)CH3, and so on.<br>
The term "alkylene" and "alkenylene" simply refer to an alkyl or alkenyl group as defined above, respectively, of the specified number of carbons that  is  divalent.     For  example,  "C1-C4  alkylene"  includes  -CH2-,  -CH2CH2-,<br>
-CH(CH3)CH2-, and so on.<br>
The definitions of R and Rl include furanose and pyranose sugar derivatives. Preferred sugar derivatives are O-protected pyranoses, such as     D-glucopyranose;     6-deoxy-6,6-difiuoro-D-glucopyranose;     6-deoxy-6-azido-D-glucopyranose; 6-amino-6-deoxy- D-glucopyranose; 6-azido-D-glucopyranose; 6-amino-D-glucopyranose;4-deoxy-4,4-difiuoro-6-deoxy-6-azido-D-glucopyranose; 2-fluoro-D-glucopyranose; D-galactopyranose; 4-deoxy-D-galactopyranose;<br><br>
4-deoxy- D-glucopyranose; and 4-methoxy- D-glucopyranose. (see, for examples, WO 98/07433, hereby incorporated by reference). Preferred furanoses include xylofiiranose, arabinofuranose, ribofuranose, allofuranose, and 2-deoxyribofuranoses.<br>
R9 can generally be any known 0-protecting group. Examples of such protecting groups include, but are not limited to: benzyl, p-nitrobenzyl, tolyl, and the like.   A more preferred protecting group is benzyl (Bn), i.e., CH2Ph.   Other suitable<br>
protecting groups will be known to those of skill in the art, examples of which can be found in Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis by Peter G. M. Wuts and Theodora W. Greene; John Wiley &amp; Sons, 3rd ed. (1999).<br>
As used herein, "biphasic system" refers to a two-phase solvent system consisting of an aqueous phase and an organic phase.<br>
The choice of activating reagent to activate the sugar for coupling can be readily discerned by those skilled in the art. Examples of such reagents include acid halides (such as SOCl2, POCl3, SOBr2, POBrs, PBrs and oxalyl chloride), sulfonyl<br>
halides, and so on. The preferred reagents are thionyl chloride and oxalyl chloride. The most preferred is thionyl chloride. Other useful reagents in the activation include triphenyl phosphine/l2, and triphenyl phosphine/azidodicarboxylate.<br>
The appropriate solvent to be used in the reaction to activate the sugar can be ascertained by the ordinary chemist. Preferred solvents are hydrocarbons (such as toluene, xylenes, heptane, and hexane), nitriles (such as acetonitrile), ethers (such as t-butyl methyl ether and tetrahydrofuran), halogenated hydrocarbons (such as methylene chloride, carbontetrachloride, chloroform, trifluorotoluene and dichloro-benzene) ketones (such as methyl isobutyl ketone and acetone) , and apolar aprotic solvents (such as N,N-dimethylformamide and l-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone). More preferred solvents are t-butyl methyl ether and tetrahydrofiiran. The most preferred solvent is t-butyl methyl ether.<br>
The activation reaction can be performed at temperatures ranging from about -50°Cto about 200°C. The preferred temperatures are about -10°C to about 30°C.<br><br>
Similarly, the appropriate solvent to use in the biphasic coupling reaction will be readily discernible to the skilled artisan. Appropriate solvents include hydrocarbons (such as toluene, xylenes, heptane, and hexane), nitriles (such as acetonitrile), ethers (such as Nbutyl methyl ether and tetrahydrofuran), halogenated hydrocarbons (such as methylene chloride, carbontetrachloride, chloroform, trifluorotoluene and dichlorobenzene) ketones (such as methyl isobutyl ketone and acetone), and apolar aprotic solvents (such as N,N-dimethylformamide and l-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone). The preferred solvents are t-butyl methyl ether, dichloromethane, and trifluorotoluene.<br>
The coupling reaction can be performed at temperatures ranging from about -50°C to about 200°C. The preferred temperatures are about 0°C to about 40°C.<br>
The preferred bases for the coupling reaction are alkali hydroxides, such as lithium, sodium, potassium, and cesium hydroxide. Potassium hydroxide and sodium hydroxide are more preferred. The base concentration in water can vary from about 5% w/w to about 95% w/w. The more preferred concentrations are about 45% to about 50%<br>
w/w.<br>
The preferred phase transfer reagents in the coupling reaction are of the general formula (Ra)4M+ A~, wherein Ra is independently H or C1-C18 aliphatic hydrocarbon; M is N or P; and A is OH, F, Br, CI, I, HSO4, CN, MeSOs, or PhCH2CO2.    A preferred phase transfer catalyst is tricaprylmethyl ammonium chloride. Other suitable phase transfer catalysts include, but are not limited to, tris-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethyl]amine (TDA-1); BnEtsN+Ck-; and (Bu)3NH+HSO4-.<br>

Step 1:<br>
100g (185 mmols) of 2, 3,4,6-0-tetrabenzyl-D-glucopyranose (6-1) was combined with 360 mL of DMF at 23°C and then cooled to 9°C. Thionyl chloride (16.2 mL; 222 mols) was added slowly over 15 minutes, during which time the temperature rose to 20°C. The solution was warmed to about 30°C and aged for 1 hour. The solution was then cooled to -10°C and 10% KOH w/w (about 150 mL) was added, during which time the temperature did not exceed 0°C. The solution was warmed to 22°C. The aqueous layer was extracted with t-butyl methyl ether (MTBE) (1 x 300 mL). The combined organic layers were then washed with brine (1 x 150 mL) and water (1 X 200 mL). The solution was concentrated under reduced pressure to the 350 mL level and used in the next step without further purification.<br>
Step 2:<br>
72 g (131 mmol) of compound 5 from Example 5 above were dissolved in 600 mL of MTBE and stirred for 10 minutes at 23°C. The solution of 6-2 made in Step 1 above was then added and, after 10 minutes, 45% w/w aqueous KOH (300 mL) was added. After an additional 10 minutes, 40% w/w Aliquat® 336 (72 g in<br><br>
110 g MTBE) was added slowly over 22 minutes. Aliquat® 336 is a brand name of tricaprylmethylammonium chloride sold by Aldrich Chemical Co., Inc., in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The solution was aged at 23°C for 6 hours and 350 mL of water were then added and allowed to mix for 5 minutes. The layers were separated and the aquoeus layer was washed with MTBE (1 x 300 mL). The combined organic layers were then washed with 10% w/w citric acid (1 x 300 mL) and water (1 x 300 mL). The organic layer was stirred at 22°C overnight during which time the product (6-3) began to crystallize. The solution was then concentrated at atmospheric pressure (bp 55°) to the 625 mL level. At this point, the solution was cooled to 23°C and methanol (225 mL) was added slowly over 1 hour. The slurry was then cooled to -5°C and aged for 45 minutes. The solids were isolated and washed with chilled 1:1 methanol/MTBE (2 x 400 mL). Drying in vacuo at 25°-40°C provided the product 6-3 with over 99% purity by liquid chromatography.<br>
