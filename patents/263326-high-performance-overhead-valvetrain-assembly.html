				<td>HIGH PERFORMANCE OVERHEAD VALVETRAIN ASSEMBLY<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001]	The present application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional<br>
Application No. 60/901,780 filed on February 16, 2007. The disclosure of the<br>
above provisional application is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0002]	The invention relates generally to overhead valve train<br>
assemblies and more particularly to overhead valvetrain assemblies having<br>
stabilized rocker arms.<br>
[0003]	In many conventional overhead valvetrain configurations,<br>
one end of a rocker arm engages a lash adjuster, the opposite end engages a<br>
valve stem and a roller or other friction reducing device in the middle of the<br>
rocker arm engages the camshaft. So configured, there is no fixed axis about<br>
which the rocker arm pivots and thus the rocker arm cannot be stabilized by<br>
being mounted on a shaft. Rather, the rocker arm must be and is maintained in<br>
its proper position by cooperation between a convex, hemi-spherical feature on<br>
the lash adjuster and a complementary concave, hemi-spherical feature on the<br>
rocker arm. This mounting arrangement has not always proven to be<br>
satisfactory as side loads on the assembly may result in the rocker arm moving<br>
out of its desired, operating position. Additionally, there are inherent limits to<br>
1<br><br>
rocker arm rotation and valve lift which, if exceeded, will again result in the<br>
rocker arm moving out of position.<br>
[0004]	From the foregoing discussion, it is apparent that<br>
improvements in the art of overhead valvetrains and lash adjusters are desirable.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0005]	The present invention encompasses a high performance<br>
overhead valvetrain assembly which has a rocker arm pivotally supported on a<br>
trunnion which, in turn, is supported by a hydraulic lash adjuster. The end of the<br>
rocker arm opposite the trunnion engages a valve stem. Between the trunnion<br>
and the valve stem is a roller which engages a cam on a camshaft. In a second<br>
embodiment, the hydraulic lash adjuster is replaced by a fixed post and lash is<br>
adjusted by shims or lash caps of varying thickness. In a third embodiment, the<br>
hydraulic lash adjuster is utilized and includes a sliding element disposed within a<br>
sleeve that engages the ball of the adjuster. The sliding element permits relative<br>
radial motion between the adjuster and the sleeve to accommodate differences in<br>
concentricity between the ball of the adjuster and the bore of the cylinder head.<br>
1 he trunnion stabilized rocker arm according to the present invention permits<br>
significantly increased valve lift and improved engine performance.<br>
[0006]	Thus it is an object of the present invention to provide an<br>
overhead valvetrain assembly having a hydraulic lash adjuster and rocker arm<br>
having a supporting trunnion and camshaft engaging roller.<br>
2<br><br>
[0007]	It is a further object of the present invention to provide an<br>
overhead valvetrain assembly having a stabilized rocker arm including a trunnion<br>
mounted upon a lash adjuster.<br>
[0008]	It is still further object of the present invention to provide an<br>
overhead valvetrain having a solid support post for a trunnion pivotally supporting<br>
a rocker arm where lash is adjusted by shims or lash caps.<br>
[0009]	Further objects, advantages and applicatioons of the present<br>
invention will become apparent by reference to the following description and<br>
appended drawings wherein like reference numbers refer to the same<br>
component, element or feature.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED AND ALTERNATE EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0020]	Referring now to Figure 1, a typical prior art valvetrain<br>
assembly is illustrated and designated by the reference number 10. The prior art<br>
valvetrain assembly 10 includes a hydraulic lash adjuster 12 having a hemi-<br>
spherical terminal portion 14 which is received within a complementary hemi-<br>
spherical socket 16 disposed at one end of a rocker arm 20. The rocker arm 20<br>
4<br><br>
also includes a cam follower 22 supported by an antifriction bearing such as a<br>
roller or ball bearing 24. The cam follower 22 engages a cam 26 on an overhead<br>
camshaft 28 in accordance with conventional practice. At the end of the rocker<br>
arm 20 opposite the lash adjuster 12 and in contact with the rocker arm 20 is a<br>
stem portion 32 of a valve 34. It will be appreciated that in this prior art valvetrain<br>
configuration, the rocker arm 20 is restrained in its operating position primarily by<br>
cooperation between the hemi-spherical terminal portion 14 of the hydraulic lash<br>
adjuster 12 and the complementary hemi-spherical socket 16 of the rocker arm<br>
20. This mounting arrangement can impose a limit on the speed of the engine<br>
and limit the extent of valve travel or lift.<br>
[0021]	Referring now to Figure 2, a first embodiment of an<br>
overhead valvetrain assembly 40 according to the present invention is illustrated<br>
and designated by the reference number 40. The overhead valvetrain assembly<br>
40 is illustrated in an exemplary cylinder head 42 which includes a blind bore 44<br>
which communicates with a supply of pressurized oil (not illustrated) through a<br>
passageway 45. The blind bore 42 receives a hydraulic lash adjuster assembly<br>
50. The cylinder head 42 also defines an elongate passageway 46 which<br>
slidably receives a stem of an intake or exhaust valve 48. The end of the<br>
hydraulic lash adjuster assembly 50 extending beyond the cylinder head 42 is<br>
received within a trunnion 70 which, in turn, is rotatably received within a rocker<br>
arm assembly 90.<br>
[0022]	Referring now to Figures 2, 3 and 4A, the hydraulic lash<br>
adjuster assembly 50 includes a outer shell or sleeve 52 which is slidably<br>
5<br><br>
received within the blind bore 44 of the cylinder head 42. The shell or sleeve 52<br>
includes a radially projecting alignment pin or dowel 54 which is received within a<br>
complementary axial channel or slot 55 in the side wall of the blind bore 44. As<br>
will be appreciated, cooperation between the dowel 54 and the axial channel 55<br>
in the blind bore 44 inhibits rotation of the outer shell or sleeve 52 relative to the<br>
cylinder head 42. A radial passageway 58 in the outer shell or sleeve 52<br>
communicates with the hollow interior of the outer shell or sleeve 52 in which is<br>
disposed a conventional hydraulic lash adjuster 60. A hemi-spherical terminal<br>
portion 62 of the lash adjuster 60 is received within a complementary hemi-<br>
spherical socket 64 within the shell or sleeve 52. The exterior of the shell or<br>
sleeve 52 includes a shoulder 66 which defines a smaller diameter, terminal<br>
portion 68.<br>
[0023]	The trunnion 70 defines a cylindrical body 72 having a<br>
through, radially oriented circular opening or bore 74 which securely receives by ,<br>
for example, an interference fit or other attachment means, the terminal portion<br>
68 of the shell or sleeve 52 of the lash adjuster assembly 50. The cylindrical<br>
body 72 of the trunnion 70 also defines a flat shoulder 76 extending about the<br>
opening or bore 74 which contacts the shoulder 66 on the sleeve 52 when the<br>
two components are assembled.<br>
[0024]	The trunnion 70 is received within a transverse cylindrical<br>
passageway 88 in the rocker arm assembly 90. A pair of anti-friction ball<br>
bearing assemblies 92A, one of which is illustrated in Figure 3, are disposed<br>
between each end of the trunnion 70 and the cylindrical passageway 88 in the<br>
6<br><br>
rocker arm assembly 90. The ball bearing assemblies 92A may be replaced by<br>
other types of antifriction bearings or journal bearings as described below. The<br>
rocker arm assembly 90 includes at least one opening 94 which receives the<br>
shell or sleeve 52 of the hydraulic lash adjuster assembly 50 and allows rotation<br>
of the trunnion 70 and the lash adjuster assembly 50 within the passageway 88<br>
of the rocker arm assembly 90. The rocker arm assembly 90 also supports a<br>
cam roller 96 preferably including an antifriction ball or roller bearing assembly 98<br>
supported on a stub shaft 100.<br>
[0025]	As illustrated in Figure 2, in accordance with conventional<br>
practice, the cam roller 96 is engaged by a rotating cam 102 on an overhead<br>
camshaft 104. The end of the rocker arm assembly 90 opposite the hydraulic<br>
lash adjuster assembly 50 includes a surface 106 which engages the terminal<br>
portion of the stem of the valve 48.<br>
[0026]	Referring now to Figure 4B, an alternate bearing<br>
arrangement, noted above, in which the cylindrical body 72 of the trunnion 70 is<br>
supported within the passageway 88 of the rocker arm assembly 90 by a pair of<br>
roller bearing assemblies 92B, is illustrated. The roller bearing assemblies 92B<br>
provide improved stability of the rocker arm assembly 90. Other components of<br>
the embodiment, such as the lash adjuster assembly 50, the shell or sleeve 52<br>
having a terminal portion 68 which is received within the opening or bore 74 of<br>
the trunnion 70, the hydraulic lash adjuster 60 and the rocker arm assembly 90<br>
are the same.<br>
7<br><br>
[0027] Referring now to Figure 4C, another alternate bearing<br>
arrangement, noted above, in which the cylindrical body 72 of the trunnion 70 is<br>
supported within the passageway 88 of the rocker arm assembly 90 by a pair of<br>
journal bearings 92C, is illustrated. Preferably, the exterior surface of the<br>
cylindrical body 88 of the trunnion 90 is hard coated with a surface treatment that<br>
exhibits increased hardness and reduced friction. Alternatively, the surface of<br>
the passageway 88 of the rocker arm assembly 90 or both surfaces may be hard<br>
coated. Other components of the embodiment, such as the lash adjuster<br>
assembly 50, the shell or sleeve 52 having a terminal portion 68 which is<br>
received within the opening or bore 74 of the trunnion 70, the hydraulic lash<br>
adjuster 60 and the rocker arm assembly 90 are the same. It will be appreciated<br>
that although illustrated in conjunction with the first embodiment 40 of the<br>
invention, all three bearing arrangements, i.e., ball or roller bearing assemblies or<br>
journal bearings, are equally suitable for use in the second and third<br>
embodiments of the invention.<br>
[0028]	Referring now to Figure 5, a second embodiment of a<br>
valvetrain assembly according to the present invention is illustrated and<br>
designated by the reference number 110. The second embodiment valvetrain<br>
assembly 110 is associated with a cylinder head 42, an intake or exhaust valve<br>
48 and a rotating cam 102 on a camshaft 104. The second embodiment<br>
valvetrain assembly 110 includes a trunnion 70 having a flat shoulder 76 which is<br>
received within a rocker arm assembly 90 having a cam roller 96 and a valve<br>
stem engaging surface 106.<br>
8<br><br>
[0029]	Distinct in the second embodiment valvetrain assembly 110<br>
is a solid, cylindrical stanchion or post 112 which is received within the blind<br>
machined bore 44 in the cylinder head. The exterior surface of the stanchion or<br>
post 112 includes a radially projecting pin or dowel 114 which is received within<br>
an axial slot or channel 116 in the sidewall of the machined bore 44 to inhibit<br>
rotation of the stanchion or post 112. The stanchion or post 112 includes a flat<br>
shoulder 118 which defines a reduced diameter portion 122. The reduced<br>
diameter portion 122 of the stanchion or post 112 is received and secured,<br>
preferably by an interference fit, in the opening or bore 74 in the trunnion 70 and<br>
the flat shoulder 118 engages the shoulder 76 of the trunnion 70 when the two<br>
components are assembled.<br>
[0030]	It should be appreciated that the solid stanchion or post 112<br>
is incapable of providing lash adjustment. Instead, lash adjustment is achieved<br>
by utilizing shims or lash caps (not illustrated) of varying thickness which are<br>
disposed between the end of the valve 48 and the surface 106 of the rocker arm<br>
assembly 90. The second embodiment valvetrain assembly 110 provides a<br>
stiffer valvetrain assembly for very high performance engines such as racing<br>
engines and similar applications in which automatic lash adjustment, i.e., lash<br>
adjustment provided by, for example, a hydraulic lash adjuster, is neither<br>
necessary nor required.<br>
[0031]	Referring now to Figure 6, a third embodiment valvetrain<br>
assembly 130 is illustrated. The third embodiment valvetrain assembly 130 is the<br>
similar to the first embodiment valvetrain assembly 40 in most respects in that it<br>
9<br><br>
includes a hydraulic lash adjuster assembly 50', the trunnion 70 and the rocker<br>
arm assembly 90. Additionally, the third embodiment valvetrain assembly 130<br>
includes a transversely sliding element or disc 132 in the throat of the shell or<br>
sleeve 52 having a hemi-spherical socket 134 that engages the hemi-spherical<br>
terminal portion 62 of the hydraulic lash adjuster 60. The element or disc 132<br>
allows for relative radial motion between the lash adjuster 60 and the shell or<br>
sleeve 52 to accommodate any difference in concentricity between the hemi<br>
spherical terminal portion 62 of the lash adjuster 60 and the bore 44 in the<br>
cylinder head 42. The element or disc 132 applies the load to the throat of the<br>
shell or sleeve 52 and thence to the trunnion 70 to eliminate the lash in the<br>
valvetrain.<br>
[0032]	While the best mode for carrying out the invention have been<br>
described in detail, it is to be understood that the terminology used is intended to<br>
be in the nature of words and description rather than of limitation. Those familiar<br>
with the art to which this invention relates will recognize that many modifications<br>
of the present invention are possible in light of the above teachings. It is,<br>
therefore, to be understood that within the scope of the appended claims, the<br>
invention may be practiced in a substantially equivalent way other than as<br>
specifically described herein.<br>
[0033]	The description of the embodiments of the present invention<br>
are merely exemplary in nature and variations that do not depart from the gist of<br>
the invention are intended to be within the scope of the invention. Such<br>
10<br><br>
variations are not to be regarded as a departure from the spirit and scope of the<br>
invention.<br>
