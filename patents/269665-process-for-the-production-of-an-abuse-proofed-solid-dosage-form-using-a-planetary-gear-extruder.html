				<td>Process for the production of an abuse-proofed solid dosage form using a planetary-gear extruder<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the production of an abuse-proofed solid dosage form containing at least one active ingredient with potential for abuse and at least one synthetic or natural polymer (C) with a breaking strength of &gt; 500 N, characterised in that a mixture comprising the active ingredient and the polymer component (C) is processed by melt extrusion with the assistance of a planetary-gear extruder into formed articles which are optionally subjected to singulation and optionally to further shaping to yield the dosage form.<br>
Many pharmaceutical active ingredients, in addition to having excellent activity in their appropriate application, also have abuse potential, i.e. they can be used by an abuser to bring about effects other than those intended. Opioids, for example, which are highly active in combating severe to very severe pain, are frequently used by abusers to induce a state of narcosis or euphoria.<br>
In order to make abuse possible, the corresponding dosage forms, such as tablets or capsules are comminuted, for example ground in a mortar, by the abuser, the active ingredient is extracted from the resultant powder using a preferably aqueous liquid and the resultant solution, optionally after being filtered through cotton wool or cellulose wadding, is administered parenterally, in particular intravenously. An additional phenomenon of this kind of administration, in comparison with oral abuse, is a further accelerated increase in active ingredient levels giving the abuser the desired effect, namely the "kick" or "rush". This kick is also obtained if the powdered dosage form is administered abusively nasally, i.e. is sniffed. Since delayed-release dosage forms containing active ingredients with potential for abuse do not give rise to the kick desired by the abuser when taken orally even in abusively high quantities, such dosage forms are also comminuted and extracted in order to be abused.<br>
US-A-4,070,494 proposed adding a swellable agent to the dosage form in order to prevent abuse. When water is added to extract the active ingredient, this agent swells and ensures that the filtrate separated from the gel contains only a small quantity of active ingredient.<br>
The multilayer tablet disclosed in WO 95/20947 is based on a similar approach to preventing parenteral abuse, said tablet containing the active ingredient with abuse potential and at least one gel former, each in different layers.<br>
WO 03/015531 A2 discloses another approach to preventing parenteral abuse. A dosage form containing an analgesic opioid and a dye as an aversive agent is described therein. The colour released by tampering with the dosage form is intended to discourage the abuser from using the dosage form which has been tampered with.<br>
Another known option for complicating abuse involves adding antagonists to the active ingredients to the dosage form, for example naloxone or naltrexone for opioids, or compounds which cause a physiological defence response, such as for example ipecacuanha (ipecac) root.<br>
Since, however, as in the past, it is in most cases necessary for the purposes of abuse to pulverise the dosage form, it was the object of the present invention to provide a process for the production of dosage forms containing active ingredients with potential for abuse, which, when correctly administered, ensure the desired therapeutic action, but from which the active ingredients cannot be converted into a form suitable for abuse simply by pulverisation.<br>
This object was achieved by the provision of the process according to the invention for the production of an abuse-proofed solid dosage form containing at least one active ingredient with potential for abuse and at least one synthetic or natural polymer (C) with a breaking strength of at least 500 N, characterised in that a mixture comprising the active ingredient and the polymer component (C) is processed by melt extrusion with the assistance of a planetary-gear extruder into formed articles which are optionally subjected to singulation and shaping to yield the dosage form.<br>
With the assistance of the process according to the invention using component (C) with the stated minimum breaking strength and formulation with the assistance of a planetary-gear extruder, it is possible to provide a dosage form with a breaking<br>
strength of at least 500 N, preferably of at least 750 N, which compliqates considerably or prevents pulverisation of the dosage form with conventional means and subsequent abuse.<br>
Preferably, component (C) is present in such quantities that the dosage form obtained according to the invention exhibits a breaking strength of at least 500 N, preferably of 750 N.<br>
As already stated, without sufficient comminution of the dosage form, non-hazardous parenteral, in particular intravenous, administration is impossible or extraction of the active ingredient takes the abuser too long, or no kick is obtained on abusive oral administration, since spontaneous release does not occur.<br>
According to the invention, comminution is taken to mean pulverisation of the dosage form with conventional means which are available to an abuser, such as for example a pestle and mortar, a hammer, a mallet or other usual means for pulverisation by application of force.<br>
Planetary-gear extruders are known and described inter alia in detail in Handbuch der Kunststoff-Extrusionstechnik I (1989) "Grundlagen" in Chapter 1.2 "Klassifizierung von Extrudern", pages 4 to 6. The corresponding description is hereby introduced as a reference and is deemed to be part of the disclosure.<br>
The use of planetary-gear extruders for the production of preferably porous granules comprising a pharmaceutical active ingredient by wet pelletisation is already disclosed in WO 03/028698. This publication does not make any reference to the procedure according to the invention for the production of an abuse-proofed dosage form comprising at least one active ingredient with potential for abuse.<br>
The dosage forms produced according to the invention with a breaking strength of at least 500 N, by which parenteral, nasal and/or oral abuse of active ingredients with potential for abuse is extensively prevented, are not therefore obvious from the prior art.<br>
Active ingredients with potential for abuse, preferably pharmaceutical active ingredients with potential for abuse, are known to the person skilled in the art, as are the quantities thereof to be used, and may be protected against abuse as such, in the form of the corresponding derivatives thereof, in particular esters, ethers or amides, or in each case in the form of corresponding physiologically acceptable compounds, in particular in the form of the salts or solvates thereof, as racemates, enantiomers or stereoisomers by the process according to the invention for the production of corresponding dosage forms.<br>
The process according to the invention is particularly suitable for the prevention of abuse of a preferably pharmaceutical active ingredient from a solid, preferably oral dosage form, which active ingredient is selected from the group comprising opioids, tranquillisers, preferably benzodiazepine; barbiturates, stimulants and further narcotics.<br>
Substances which fall within the class of opioids are known to the person skilled in the art, for example, from "Opioid Analgesics" by Alan F. Casy et al. 1986 edition, in particular also page 508 to 518, Plenum Publishing Corporation, "Analgesics" by H. Buschmann, 2002 edition, page 171 to 245, WILEY-CHF and "Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry" by Elmar Fiedrics et al., 6th edition, pages 1 to 53, WILEY-VCH. The opioids listed therein and the metabolites thereof are particularly preferred. The corresponding description is hereby introduced as a reference and is deemed to be part of the disclosure.<br>
The process according to the invention is very particularly suitable for preventing abuse of dosage forms comprising at least one opioid, tranquilliser and/or another narcotic selected from the group comprising N-{1-[2-(4-ethyl-5-oxo-2-tetrazolin-1-yl)ethyl]-4-methoxymethyl-4-piperidyl}propionanilide (alfentanil), 5,5-diallylbarbituric acid (allobarbital), allylprodine, alphaprodine, 8-chloro-1-methyl-6-phenyl-4H-[1,2,4]triazolo[4,3-a][1,4]-benzodiazepine (alprazolam), 2-diethylaminopropiophenone (amfepramone), (±)-a-methylphenethylamine (amphetamine), 2-(o&gt; methylphenethylamino)-2-phenylacetonitrile(amphetaminil), 5-ethyl-5-<br>

These polymers have a viscosity at 25°C of 4500 to 17600 cP, measured on a 5 wt.% aqueous solution using a model RVF Brookfield viscosimeter (spindle no. 2 / rotational speed 2 rpm), of 400 to 4000 cP, measured on a 2 wt.% aqueous solution using the stated viscosimeter (spindle no. 1 or 3 / rotational speed 10 rpm) or of 1650 to 10000 cP, measured on a 1 wt.% aqueous solution using the stated viscosimeter (spindle no. 2 / rotational speed 2 rpm) (c.f. Handbook of Pharmaceutical Excipients by Raymond C. Rowe et al., 4th edition, 2003, page 460).<br>
The polymers are preferably used in powder form. They may be water-soluble or water-swellable.<br>
Component (C) .is preferably used in.,a quantity of 20 to 99.9 wt.%, particularly preferably of at least 35 wt.%, very particularly preferably of at least 50 wt.%, relative to the total weight of the dosage form.<br>
Auxiliary substances (B) which may be used are the conventional auxiliary substances known for the formulation of solid dosage forms. These are preferably plasticisers, such as polyethylene glycol in quantities of 0.01 to 20 wt.%, particularly preferably of up to 15 wt.% and very particularly preferably of up to 10 wt.%, auxiliary substances which influence active ingredient release, as listed below, preferably hydrophobic or hydrophilic, preferably hydrophilic polymers, very particularly preferably hydroxypropylmethylcellulose or hydroxypropylcellulose, and/or antioxidants. Suitable antioxidants are ascorbic acid, butylhydroxyanisole, butylhydroxytoluene, salts of ascorbic acid, monothioglycerol, phosphorous acid, vitamin C, vitamin E and the derivatives thereof, sodium bisulfite, particularly preferably butylhydroxytoluene (BHT) or butylhydroxyanisole (BHA) and a-tocopherol.<br>
The antioxidant is preferably used in quantities of 0.01 to 10 wt.%, preferably of 0.03 to 5 wt.%, relative to the entire weight of the dosage form.<br>
In order to achieve the necessary breaking strength with the process according to the invention, it is furthermore possible additionally to use at least one natural, semisynthetic or synthetic wax (D) with a breaking strength, measured using the method disclosed in the present application, of at least 500 N, preferably of 750 N. Waxes with a softening point of at least 60°C are preferred. Carnauba wax and beeswax are particularly preferred. Carnauba wax is very particularly preferred. Camauba wax is a natural wax which is obtained from the leaves of the carnauba palm and has a softening point of at most 90°C. When the wax component is additionally used, it is used together with at least one polymer (C), preferably with at least one polyethylene oxide, in quantities such that the dosage form has a breaking strength of at least 500 N, preferably of at least 750 N, measured using the method stated in the present application.<br>
- Surprisingly, by extruding a mixture comprising the active ingredient with potential for abuse (A) and with the assistance of a planetary-gear extruder using the melt method, it is possible simply and reproducibly to achieve the necessary breaking strength of at least 500 N, which ensures that pulverisation of the dosage form is impossible with conventional means and thus subsequent abuse is complicated considerably or prevented.<br>
To perform the process according to the invention, at least one active ingredient with potential for abuse, the component or components (C) and optionally a wax (D), optionally at least one of the further optionally present abuse-preventing components (a) to (f) listed below and optionally present auxiliary substances such as antioxidants, plasticisers and/or delayed-release auxiliary substances are processed with the assistance of a planetary-gear extruder to yield the dosage form according to the invention.<br>
Below, the use of planetary-gear extruder in the process according to the invention is explained with reference to Figures 1 and 2. These explanations are given merely by way of example and do not restrict the general concept of the invention.<br>
Figure 1   shows a section through a planetary-gear extruder and Figure 2   shows the mode of operation of the planetary-gear extruder.<br>
Figure 1 shows a planetary-gear extruder which may be used in the process according to the invention. This extruder substantially comprises a shaft 1, which, relative to the transport direction of the mixture of the components listed above to be extruded, is initially constructed as a feed screw 5 and subsequently as the central spindle 3 with a spindle head in the die zone (32) of the planetary-gear extruder. Around the central spindle 3 there are preferably arranged three to seven planetary spindles 4, which are in turn surrounded by a casing in the form of a housing 6.<br>
In the planetary-gear extruder, extrusion of the composition used in the process according to the invention for the production of a pharmaceutical dosage form<br>
preferably-proceeds as follows, with .reference to.Figure 1. As shown,by arrow 2,, the, components to be extruded are apportioned by means of a suitable powder apportioning unit, at least one apportioning unit, by the feed device 7 in the zone of the feed screw 5 and conveyed by the rotation thereof (drive not shown) in the direction of the central spindle 3. The person skilled in the art will understand that it is possible to mix the starting materials (components) in the zone of the feed screw. However, it is also possible to premix the components of the dosage form and to apportion this mixture via the feed device 7 in the zone of the feed screw 5. In the feed zone of the planetary-gear extruder, the mixture is conveyed onwards to the extrusion zone (9), where it is heated at least until component (C) softens. In the zone of the central spindle 3, i.e. in the extrusion zone 9, the heated mixture is conveyed, optionally further homogenised, compressed or compacted by the interaction of the central spindle 3 and the planetary spindles 4, and conveyed to the die zone 8, where an extruded strand or extruded strands, depending on how many bores the die comprises, is/are extruded. The die geometry or the geometry of the bores is freely selectable. Thus, the die or the bores may exhibit a round, oblong or oval cross-section, wherein the round cross-section preferably has a diameter of 0.1 mm to 15 mm and the oblong cross-section preferably has a maximum length of 21 mm and a width 10 mm. The extrusion die may also take the form of a slot die. Preferably, the die or the bores have a round cross-section. Both the casing 6 of the planetary-gear extruder used according to the invention and the central spindle may be heated or cooled. The corresponding temperature adjustment, i.e. heating or cooling, is so arranged that the mixture to be extruded exhibits an average temperature corresponding to the softening temperature of component (C) and does not rise above a temperature at which the active ingredient with potential for abuse may be damaged. Preferably, the temperature of the mixture to be extruded is adjusted to below 180°C, preferably below 150°C, but at least to the softening temperature of component (C). Thanks to the compression and extrusion of the at least plastified mixture, dosage forms are obtained which exhibit a breaking strength of at least 500 N.<br>
After extrusion of the at least partially molten mixture and optional cooling of the extruded strand or extruded strands, the extrudates are comminuted (not shown in<br>
Figure 1) This comminution may preferably be performed by cutting up the extrudates by means of revolving or rotating knives, water jet cutters, wires, blades or with the assistance of laser cutters or ultrasound cutters.<br>
Optionally after further cooling of the comminuted extrudates, which are preferably present in the form of disks, they are optionally re-shaped into the final shape of the dosage form, wherein they may be exposed to heat again if necessary.<br>
This shaping for example into tablets may proceed in that the plastic extrudate is shaped with press moulding with the assistance of two contrarotating rolls preferably with mutually opposing recesses in the roll sleeve for plastification, the construction of which recesses determines the tablet shape.<br>
However, it is also possible to form the tablets from the singulated extrudates in each case with the assistance of an optionally heated die and at least one shaping punch. To this end, the cylindrical granules obtained after comminution of the extruded strand may preferably be used. Apart from being press-moulded into tablets, these granules or other multiparticulate shapes obtained, such as pellets or spheroids, may also be packaged into capsules in order to be used as a dosage form produced according to the invention.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment, the extruded strands extruded through a plurality of bores in the extrusion die may, after cooling thereof, optionally be brought together by interlacing or wrapping in the manner of rope production to yield a thicker strand than the individual extruded strands. This strand may optionally be further processed by solvent attack with a suitable solvent or by heating to the softening point of component (C) and optionally removing the solvent in accordance with the above-stated comminution and shaping of an individual strand.<br>
Figure 2 shows a cross-section through the planetary-gear extruder. Around the rotating central spindle 3 there are arranged at least three, in the case illustrated 6, planetary spindles 4, whose flanks 41 interact on the one hand with the flanks 31 of the central spindle 3 and on the other hand with the flanks 61 of the casing 6 of the<br>
planetary-gear extruder. Through rotation of the central spindle. S^and rolling of the respective flanks over one another, the planetary spindles 4 each rotate round their own axis, as shown by arrow 42, and round the central spindle 4, as shown by arrow 43. In this way, the compression or compaction sought according to the invention of the component mixture used according to the invention of the dosage forms produced according to the invention is achieved.<br>
If necessary, the planetary-gear extruder used may comprise not only an extrusion zone (9) but also at least one further zone, so that the mixture to be extruded may optionally also be degassed.<br>
The process according to the invention may be performed discontinuously or continuously, preferably continuously.<br>
The dosage forms obtained by the process according to the invention are distinguished as stated in that they cannot be pulverised due to their hardness. This virtually rules out oral or parenteral, in particular intravenous or nasal abuse. However, in order to prevent any possible abuse of the dosage forms obtained by the production process according to the invention in the event of comminution and/or pulverisation which possibly occur nonetheless due to extraordinary force, in a preferred embodiment these dosage forms may contain further abuse-complicating or -preventing agents as auxiliary substances.<br>
Thus, the dosage form obtained according to the invention may comprise, in addition to at least one active ingredient with potential for abuse, at least one polymer component (C) and optionally one wax (D), at least one of the following components:<br>
at least one substance which irritates the nasal passages and/or pharynx,<br>
at least one viscosity-increasing agent, which, with the assistance of a<br>
necessary minimum quantity of an aqueous liquid, preferably as an aqueous<br>
extract obtained from the dosage form, forms a gel which preferably remains<br>
visually distinguishable .when introduced into a further .quantity of an. aqueous., liquid,<br>
at least one antagonist for each of the active ingredients with potential for<br>
abuse,<br>
at least one emetic,<br>
at least one dye as an aversive agent,<br>
at least one bitter substance.<br>
Components (a) to (f) are additionally each individually suitable for abuse-proofing the dosage forms obtained by the process according to the invention. Accordingly, component (a) is preferably suitable for proofing the dosage form against nasal, oral and/or parenteral, preferably intravenous, abuse, component (b) is preferably suitable for proofing against parenteral, particularly preferably intravenous and/or nasal abuse, component (c) is preferably suitable for proofing against nasal and/or parenteral, particularly preferably intravenous, abuse, component (d) is preferably suitable for proofing against parenteral, particularly preferably intravenous, and/or oral and/or nasal abuse, component (e) is suitable as a visual deterrent against oral or parenteral abuse and component (f) is suitable for proofing against oral or nasal abuse. Combined use according to the invention of at least one of the above-stated components makes it possible still more effectively to prevent abuse of dosage forms obtained by the process according to the invention.<br>
For example, the dosage form obtained according to the invention may also comprise two or more of components (a)-(f) in a combination, preferably (a), (b) and optionally (c) and/or (f) and/or (e) or (a), (b) and optionally (d) and/or (f) and/or (e).<br>
In another embodiment, the dosage form according to the invention may comprise all of components (a)-(f).<br>
If the dosage form obtained by the process according to the .invention CQnpp$es,an _ abuse-preventing component (a), substances which irritate the nasal passages and/or pharynx which may be considered according to the invention are any substances which, when administered abusively via the nasal passages and/or pharynx, bring about a physical reaction which is either so unpleasant for the abuser that he/she does not wish to or cannot continue administration, for example burning, or physiologically counteracts taking of the corresponding active ingredient, for example due to increased nasal secretion or sneezing. These substances which conventionally irritate the nasal passages and/or pharynx may also bring about a very unpleasant sensation or even unbearable pain when administered parenterally, in particular intravenously, such that the abuser does not wish to or cannot continue taking the substance.<br>
Particularly suitable substances which irritate the nasal passages and/or pharynx are those which cause burning, itching, an urge to sneeze, increased formation of secretions or a combination of at least two of these stimuli. Appropriate substances and the quantities thereof which are conventionally to be used are known per se to the person skilled in the art or may be identified by simple preliminary testing.<br>
The substance which irritates the nasal passages and/or pharynx of component (a) is preferably based on one or more constituents or one or more plant parts of at least one hot substance drug.<br>
Corresponding hot substance drugs are known per se to the person skilled in the art and are described, for example, in "Pharmazeutische Biologie - Drogen und ihre Inhaltsstoffe" by Prof. Dr. Hildebert Wagner, 2nd., revised edition, Gustav Fischer Verlag, Stuttgart-New York, 1982, pages 82 et seq.. The corresponding description is hereby introduced as a reference and is deemed to be part of the disclosure.<br>
One or more constituents of at least one hot substance drug selected from the group comprising Allii sativi bulbus (garlic), Asari rhizoma cum herba (Asarum root and leaves), Calami rhizoma (calamus root), Capsici fructus (capsicum), Capsici fructus acer (cayenne pepper), Curcumae longae rhizoma (turmeric root), Curcumae<br>
-xanthorrhizae rhlzoma (Javanese turmeric root)1,A
The constituents of the hot substance drugs preferably comprise o-methoxy-(methyl)phenol compounds, acid amide compounds, mustard oils or sulfide compounds or compounds derived therefrom.<br>
Particularly preferably, at least one constituent of the hot substance drugs is selected from the group consisting of myristicin, elemicin, isoeugenol, a-asarone, safrole, gingerols, xanthorrhizol, capsaicinoids, preferably capsaicin, capsaicin derivatives, such as N-vanillyl-9E-octadecenamide, dihydrocapsaicin, nordihydrocapsaicin, homocapsaicin, norcapsaicin and nomorcapsaicin, piperine, preferably trans-piperine, glucosinolates, preferably based on non-volatile mustard oils, particularly preferably based on p-hydroxybenzyl mustard oil, methylmercapto mustard oil or methylsulfonyl mustard oil, and compounds derived from these constituents.<br>
If one or more constituents of corresponding hot substance drugs are used, the quantity thereof in a dosage unit obtained by the process according to the invention preferably amounts to 0.001 to 0.005 wt.%, relative to the total weight of the dosage unit.<br>
A dosage unit is taken to mean a separate or separable administration unit, such as for example a tablet or a capsule.<br>
The dosage form obtained by the process according to the invention may preferably contain the plant parts of the corresponding hot substance drugs in a quantity of 0.01 to 30 wt.%, particularly preferably of 0.1 to 0.5 wt.%, in each case relative to the total weight of the dosage unit.<br>
Another option for preventing abuse of the dosage form obtained according to the invention consists in adding at least one viscosity-increasing agent as a further abuse-preventing component (b) to the dosage form, which, with the assistance of a necessary minimum quantity of an aqueous liquid, forms a gel with the extract obtained from the dosage form, which gel is virtually impossible to administer safely and preferably remains visually distinguishable when introduced into a further quantity of an aqueous liquid.<br>
For the purposes of the present invention visually distinguishable means that the active ingredient-containing gel formed with the assistance of a necessary minimum quantity of aqueous liquid, when introduced, preferably with the assistance of a hypodermic needle, into a further quantity of aqueous liquid at 37°C, remains substantially insoluble and cohesive and cannot straightforwardly be dispersed in such a manner that it can safely be administered parenterally, in particular intravenously. The material preferably remains visually distinguishable for at least one minute, preferably for at least 10 minutes.<br>
The increased viscosity of the extract makes it more difficult or even impossible for it to be passed through a needle or injected. If the gel remains visually distinguishable, this means that the gel obtained on introduction into a further quantity of aqueous liquid, for example by injection into blood, initially remains in the form of a largely cohesive thread, which, while it may indeed be broken up mechanically into smaller fragments, cannot be dispersed or even dissolved in such a manner that it can safely be administered parenterally, in particular intravenously. In combination with at least one optionally present component (a) or c to (e), this additionally leads to unpleasant burning, vomiting, bad flavour and/or visual deterrence.<br>
Intravenous administration of such a gel would therefore most probably result in serious damage to the health of the abuser.<br>
In order to verify whether a viscosity-increasing agent is suitable as component (b) for use in the dosage form obtained according to the invention, the active ingredient<br>
is mixed with the viscosity-increasing agent and suspended, in 10 ml of water at a temperature of 25°C. If this results in the formation of a gel which fulfils the above-stated conditions, the corresponding viscosity-increasing agent is suitable for preventing or averting abuse of the dosage forms obtained according to the invention.<br>
If component (b) is added to the dosage form obtained according to the invention, one or more viscosity-increasing agents are used which are selected from the group consisting of microcrystalline cellulose with 11 wt.% carboxymethylcellulose sodium (Avicel® RC 591), carboxymethylcellulose sodium (Blanose®, CMC-Na C300P®, Frimulsion BLC-5®, Tylose C300 P®), polyacrylic acid (Carbopol® 980 NF, Carbopol® 981), locust bean flour (Cesagum® LA-200, Cesagum® LID/150, Cesagum® LN-1), pectins such as citrus pectin (Cesapectin® HM Medium Rapid Set), apple pectin, pectin from lemon peel, waxy maize starch (C*Gel 04201®), sodium alginate (Frimulsion ALG (E401)®), guar flour (Frimulsion BM®, Polygum 26/1-75®), iota carrageenan (Frimulsion D021®), karaya gum, gellan gum (Kelcogel F®, Kelcogel LT100®), galactomannan (Meyprogat 150®), tara stone flour (Polygum 43/1®), propylene glycol alginate (Protanal-Ester SD-LB®), sodium hyaluronate, tragacanth, tara gum (Vidogum SP 200®), fermented polysaccharide welan gum (K1A96), xanthan gum (Xantural 180®). Xanthans are particularly preferred. The names stated in brackets are the trade names by which the materials are known commercially. In general, a quantity of 0.1 to 5 wt.% of the viscosity-increasing agent(s) is sufficient to fulfil the above-stated conditions.<br>
The component (b) viscosity-increasing agents, where provided, are preferably present in the dosage form obtained according to the invention in quantities of at least 5 mg per dosage unit, i.e. per administration unit.<br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment of the present invention, the viscosity-increasing agents used as component (b) are those which, on extraction from the dosage form with the necessary minimum quantity of aqueous liquid, form a gel which encloses air bubbles. The resultant gels are distinguished by a turbid<br>
appearance* which provides the potential abuser with an additional .optical warning and discourages him/her from administering the gel parenterally.<br>
Component (C) may also optionally serve as an additional viscosity-increasing agent which, with the assistance of a necessary minimum quantity of an aqueous liquid, forms a gel.<br>
It is also possible to formulate the viscosity-increasing agent and the other constituents in the dosage form obtained according to the invention in a mutually spatially separated arrangement.<br>
In order to discourage and prevent abuse, the dosage form obtained according to the invention may furthermore comprise component (c), namely one or more antagonists for the active ingredient or active ingredients with potential for abuse, wherein the antagonists are preferably spatially separated from the remaining constituents of the dosage form obtained according to the invention and, when correctly used, do not exert any effect.<br>
Suitable antagonists for preventing abuse of the active ingredients are known per se to the person skilled in the art and may be present in the dosage form obtained according to the invention as such or in the form of corresponding derivatives, in particular esters or ethers, or in each case in the form of corresponding physiologically acceptable compounds, in particular in the form of the salts or solvates thereof.<br>
If the active ingredient present in the dosage form is an opioid, the antagonist used is preferably an antagonist selected from the group comprising naloxone, naltrexone, nalmefene, nalide, nalmexone, nalorphine or naluphine, in each case optionally in the form of a corresponding physiologically acceptable compound, in particular in the form of a base, a salt or solvate. The corresponding antagonists, where component (c) is provided, are preferably used in a quantity of at least 1 mg, particularly preferably in a quantity of 3 to 100 mg, very particularly preferably in a quantity of 5 to 50 mg per dosage form, i.e. per administration unit.<br>
If the dosage form obtained according to the invention comprises a stimulant as active ingredient, the antagonist is preferably a neuroleptic, preferably at least one compound selected from the group consisting of haloperidol, promethazine, fluphenazine, perphenazine, levomepromazine, thioridazine, perazine, chlorpromazine, chlorprothixine, zuclopentixol, flupentixol, prothipendyl, zotepine, benperidol, pipamperone, melperone and bromperidol.<br>
The dosage form obtained according to the invention preferably comprises these antagonists in a conventional therapeutic dose known to the person skilled in the art, particularly preferably in a quantity of twice to three times the conventional dose per administration unit.<br>
If the combination to discourage and prevent abuse of the dosage form obtained according to the invention comprises component (d), it may comprise at least one emetic, which is preferably present in a spatially separated arrangement from the other components of the dosage form obtained according to the invention and, when correctly used, is intended not to exert its effect in the body.<br>
Suitable emetics for preventing abuse of an active ingredient are known to the person skilled in the art and may be present in the dosage form obtained according to the invention as such or in the form of corresponding derivatives, in particular esters or ethers, or in each case in the form of corresponding physiologically acceptable compounds, in particular in the form of the salts or solvates thereof.<br>
An emetic based on one or more constituents of ipecacuanha (ipecac) root, preferably based on the constituent emetine may preferably be considered in the dosage form obtained according to the invention, as are, for example, described in "Pharmazeutische Biologie - Drogen und ihre Inhaltsstoffe" by Prof. Dr. Hildebert Wagner, 2nd, revised edition, Gustav Fischer Verlag, Stuttgart, New York, 1982. The corresponding literature description is hereby introduced as a reference and is deemed to be part of the disclosure.<br>
•&gt;• The dosage form obtained according to the invention may preferably .comprise the emetic emetine as component (d), preferably in a quantity of at least 3 mg, particularly preferably of at least 10 mg and very particularly preferably in a quantity of at least 20 mg per dosage form, i.e. administration unit.<br>
Apomorphine may likewise preferably be used as an emetic for additional abuse-proofing, preferably in a quantity of preferably at least 3 mg, particularly preferably of at least 5 mg and very particularly preferably of at least 7 mg per administration unit.<br>
If the dosage form obtained according to the invention contains component (e) as an additional abuse-preventing auxiliary substance, the use of such a dye brings about an intense coloration of a corresponding aqueous solution, in particular when the attempt is made to extract the active ingredient for parenteral, preferably intravenous administration, which coloration may act as a deterrent to the potential abuser. Oral abuse, which conventionally begins by means of aqueous extraction of the active ingredient, may also be prevented by this coloration. Suitable dyes and the quantities required for the necessary deterrence may be found in WO 03/015531, wherein the corresponding disclosure should be deemed to be part of the present disclosure and is hereby introduced as a reference.<br>
If the dosage form obtained according to the invention contains component (f) as a further abuse-preventing auxiliary substance, this addition of at least one bitter substance and the consequent impairment of the flavour of the dosage form additionally prevents oral and/or nasal abuse.<br>
Suitable bitter substances and the quantities effective for use may be found in US-2003/0064099 A1, the corresponding disclosure of which should be deemed to be the disclosure of the present application and is hereby introduced as a reference. Suitable bitter substances are preferably aromatic oils, preferably peppermint oil, eucalyptus oil, bitter almond oil, menthol, fruit aroma substances, preferably aroma substances from lemons, oranges, limes, grapefruit or mixtures thereof, and/or denatonium benzoate (Bitrex®). Denatonium benzoate is particularly preferably used.<br>
The solid dosage form obtained according to the invention is suitable for oral, vaginal or rectal administration, preferably for oral administration, to humans and animals.<br>
The orally administrable dosage form obtained according to the invention may, as stated, be present in multiparticulate form, preferably in the form of granules, preferably in cylindrical form, spheroids, beads or pellets, optionally packaged into capsules or press-moulded into tablets. Preferably, the multiparticulate shapes exhibit a minimum size of 0.1 mm to 10 cm, particularly preferably in the range from 0.1 to 3.0 mm, particularly preferably in the range from 0.5 to 2 mm.<br>
In a further particularly preferred embodiment, the dosage form obtained according to the invention assumes the form of a tablet, a capsule or is in the form of an oral osmotic therapeutic system (OROS), preferably if at least one further abuse-preventing component (a)-(f) is also present.<br>
If components (c) and/or (d) and/or (f) are present in the dosage form obtained according to the invention, care must be taken to ensure that they are formulated in such a manner or are present in such a low dose that, when correctly administered, the dosage form is able to bring about virtually no effect which impairs the patient or the efficacy of the active ingredient.<br>
If the dosage form produced according to the invention contains component (d) and/or (f), the dosage must be selected such that, when correctly orally administered, no negative effect is caused. If, however, the intended dosage of the dosage form is exceeded inadvertently, in particular by children, or in the event of abuse, nausea or an inclination to vomit or a bad flavour are produced. The particular quantity of component (d) and/or (f) which can still be tolerated by the patient in the event of correct oral administration may be determined by the person skilled in the art by simple preliminary testing.<br>
If, however, irrespective of the fact that the dosage form produced according to the invention is virtually impossible to pulverise, the dosage form containing the components (c) and/or (d) and/or (f) is provided with protection, these components<br>
should preferably be used at a dosage which is sufficiently high that,, when abusively administered, they bring about an intense negative effect on the abuser. This is preferably achieved by spatial separation of at least the active ingredient or active ingredients from components (c) and/or (d) and/or (f), wherein the active ingredient or active ingredients is/are present in at least one subunit (X) and components (c) and/or (d) and/or (f) is/are present in at least one subunit (Y), and wherein, when the dosage form is correctly administered, components (c), (d) and (f) do not exert their effect on taking and/or in the body and the remaining components of the formulation, in particular component (C), are identical.<br>
If the dosage form according to the invention comprises at least 2 of components (c) and (d) or (f), these may each be present in the same or different subunits (Y). Preferably, when present, all the components (c) and (d) and (f) are present in one and the same subunit (Y).<br>
For the purposes of the present invention, subunits are solid formulations, which in each case, apart from conventional auxiliary substances known to the person skilled in the art, contain the active ingredient(s), preferably also at least one polymer (C) and optionally at least one of the optionally present components (a) and/or (b) and/or (e) or preferably in each case at least one polymer (C) and the antagonist(s) and/or emetic(s) and/or component (e) and/or component (f) and optionally at least one of the optionally present components (a) and/or (b). Care must here be taken to ensure that each of the subunits is formulated in accordance with the above-stated process according to the invention, if the mechanical skill is desired or required.<br>
One substantial advantage of the separated formulation of active ingredients from components (c) or (d) or (f) in subunits (X) and (Y) of the dosage form produced according to the invention is that, when correctly administered, components (c) and/or (d) and/or (f) are hardly released on taking and/or in the body or are released in such small quantities that they exert no effect which impairs the patient or therapeutic success or, on passing through the patient's body, they are only liberated in locations where they cannot be sufficiently absorbed to be effective. When the dosage form is correctly administered, preferably hardly any of components (c)<br>
,  and/or (d) and/or (f) is released into the patient's body, or they go unnoticed by the. patient.<br>
The person skilled in the art will understand that the above-stated conditions may vary as a function of the particular components (c), (d) and/or (f) used and of the formulation of the subunits or the dosage form. The optimum formulation for the particular dosage form may be determined by simple preliminary testing. What is vital, if necessary for abuse prevention, is that each subunit contains the polymer (C) and has been formulated in the stated manner and produced according to the invention.<br>
Should, contrary to expectations, the abuser succeed in comminuting such a dosage form obtained according to the invention, which comprises components (c) and/or (e) and/or (d) and/or (f) in subunits (Y), for the purpose of abusing the active ingredient and obtain a powder which is extracted with a suitable extracting agent, not only the active ingredient but also the particular component (c) and/or (e) and/or (f) and/or (d) will be obtained in a form in which it cannot readily be separated from the active ingredient, such that when the dosage form which has been tampered with is administered, in particular by oral and/or parenteral administration, it will exert its effect on taking and/or in the body combined with an additional negative effect on the abuser corresponding to component (c) and/or (d) and/or (f) or, when the attempt is made to extract the active ingredient, the coloration will act as a deterrent and so prevent abuse of the dosage form.<br>
A dosage form in which the active ingredient or active ingredients is/are spatially separated from components (c), (d) and/or (e), preferably by formulation in different subunits, may be formulated according to the invention in many different ways, wherein the corresponding subunits of such a dosage form may each be present in any desired spatial arrangement relative to one another, provided that the above-stated conditions for the release of components (c) and/or (d) are fulfilled.<br>
The person skilled in the art will understand that component(s) (a) and/or (b) which are optionally also present may preferably be formulated in the dosage form<br>
produced accord ing to the invention both in the particular subunits (X) and (Y) and in the form of independent subunits corresponding to subunits (X) and (Y), provided that neither the abuse-proofing nor the active ingredient release in the event of correct administration is impaired by the nature of the formulation and the polymer (C) is preferably included in the formulation and formulation is preferably carried out in accordance with the process according to the invention.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the dosage form produced according to the invention, subunits (X) and (Y) are present in multiparticulate form, wherein granules, spheroids, beads or pellets are preferred and the same form, i.e. shape, is selected for both subunit (X) and subunit (Y), such that it is not possible to separate subunits (X) from (Y) by mechanical selection. The multiparticulate forms are preferably of a size in the range from 0.1 to 3 mm, preferably of 0.5 to 2 mm.<br>
The subunits (X) and (Y) in multiparticulate form may also preferably be packaged in a capsule or be press-moulded into a tablet, wherein the final formulation in each case proceeds in such a manner that the subunits (X) and (Y) are also retained in the resultant dosage form.<br>
The multiparticulate subunits (X) and (Y) of identical shape should also not be visually distinguishable from one another so that the abuser cannot separate them from one another by simple sorting. This may, for example, be achieved by the application of identical coatings which, apart from this disguising function, may also incorporate further functions, such as, for example, delayed release of one or more active ingredients or provision of a finish resistant to gastric juices on the particular subunits.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment of the present invention, subunits (X) and (Y) are in each case arranged in layers relative to one another.<br>
The layered subunits (X) and (Y) are preferably arranged for this purpose vertically or horizontally relative to one another in the dosage form produced according to the invention, wherein in each case one or more layered subunits (X) and one or more<br>
.layered subunits (Y) raay^be present in the.dpsage form, such that, apart,from,th,e_ preferred layer sequences (X)-(Y) or (X)-(Y)-(X), any desired other layer sequences may be considered, optionally in combination with layers containing components (a) and/or (b).<br>
Another preferred dosage form produced according to the invention is one in which subunit (Y) forms a core which is completely enclosed by subunit (X), wherein a separation layer (Z) may be present between said layers. Such a structure is preferably also suitable for the above-stated multiparticulate forms, wherein both subunits (X) and (Y) and an optionally present separation layer (Z), which should preferably satisfy the hardness requirement according to the invention, are then formulated in one and the same multiparticulate form using the process according to the invention.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment of the dosage form produced according to the invention, the subunit (X) forms a core, which is enclosed by subunit (Y), wherein the latter comprises at least one channel which leads from the core to the surface of the dosage form.<br>
The dosage form produced according to the invention may comprise, between one<br>
layer of the subunit (X) and one layer of the subunit (Y), in each case one or more,<br>
preferably one, optionally swellable separation layer (Z) which serves to separate<br>
subunit (X) spatially from (Y).	......<br>
If the dosage form produced according to the invention comprises the layered subunits (X) and (Y) and an optionally present separation layer (Z) in an at least partially vertical or horizontal arrangement, the dosage form preferably takes the form of a tablet, a coextrudate or a laminate, which has been produced using the process according to the invention.<br>
In one particularly preferred embodiment, the entirety of the free surface of subunit (Y) and optionally at least part of the free surface of subunit(s) (X) and optionally at least part of the free surface of the optionally present separation layer(s) (Z) may be<br>

Another particularly preferred embodiment of the dosage form produced according to the invention comprises a vertical or horizontal arrangement of the layers of subunits (X) and (Y) and at least one push layer (p) arranged therebetween, and optionally a separation layer (Z), in which dosage form the entirety of the free surface of the layer structure consisting of subunits (X) and (Y), the push layer and the optionally present separation layer (Z) is provided with a semipermeable coating (E), which is permeable to a release medium, i.e. conventionally a physiological liquid, but substantially impermeable to the active ingredient and to component (c) and/or (d) and/or (f), and wherein this coating (E) comprises at least one opening for release of the active ingredient in the area of subunit (X).<br>
A corresponding dosage form is known to the person skilled in the art, for example under the name oral osmotic therapeutic system (OROS), as are suitable materials and methods for the production thereof, inter alia from US 4,612,008, US 4,765,989 and US 4,783,337. The corresponding descriptions are hereby introduced as a reference and are deemed to be part of the disclosure.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment, the subunit (X) of the dosage form produced according to the invention is in the form of a tablet, the edge face and optionally one of the two main faces of which is covered with a barrier layer (Z1) containing component (c) and/or (d) and/or (f).<br>
The person skilled in the art will understand that the auxiliary substances of the subunit(s) (X) or (Y) and of the optionally present separation layer(s) (Z) and/or of the barrier layers) (Z1) used in the production according to the invention of the respective dosage form will vary as a function of the arrangement thereof in the dosage form, the mode of administration and as a function of the particular active ingredient of the optionally present components (a) and/or (b) and/or (e) and of component (c) and/or<br>
(d) and/or (f). The materials .which have the requisite properties are, in each case known per se to the person skilled in the art.<br>
If release of component (c) and/or (d) and/or (f) from subunit (Y) of the dosage form produced according to the invention is prevented with the assistance of a cover, preferably a barrier layer, the subunit may consist of conventional materials known to the person skilled in the art, preferably contain at least one polymer (C) and preferably be produced according to the invention.<br>
If a corresponding barrier layer (Z1) is not provided to prevent release of component (c) and/or (d) and/or (f), the materials of the subunits should be selected such that release of the particular component (c) and/or (d) from subunit (Y) is virtually ruled out.<br>
The materials which are stated below to be suitable for production of the barrier layer may preferably be used for this purpose and should preferably contain at least one polymer (C) for fulfilling the hardness conditions.<br>

If the dosage form produced according to the invention, comprises a separation .layer (Z1), said layer, like the uncovered subunit (Y), may preferably consist of the above-stated materials described for the barrier layer. The person skilled in the art will understand that release of the active ingredient or of component (c) and/or (d) from the particular subunit may be controlled by the thickness of the separation layer.<br>
The dosage form produced according to the invention may comprise one or more active ingredients at least partially in delayed-release form, wherein delayed release may be achieved with the assistance of conventional materials and methods known to the person skilled in the art, for example by embedding the active ingredient in a delayed-release matrix or by the application of one or more delayed-release coatings. Active ingredient release must, however, be controlled such that the above-stated conditions are fulfilled in each case, for example that, in the event of correct administration of the dosage form, the active ingredient or active ingredients are virtually completely released before the optionally present component (c) and/or (d) can exert an impairing effect.<br>
Through delayed release, active ingredient release may be so controlled that twice or once daily administration of the dosage form is sufficient, which is advantageous in particular in the case of opioid-containing active ingredients for combatting pain.<br>
Controlled release from the dosage form produced according to the invention is preferably achieved by embedding the active ingredient in a matrix. The auxiliary substances acting as matrix materials control active ingredient release. Matrix materials may, for example, be hydrophilic, gel-forming materials, from which active ingredient release proceeds mainly by diffusion, or hydrophobic materials, from which active ingredient release proceeds mainly by diffusion from the pores in the matrix.<br>

Matrix materials prepared from hydrophobic materials, such as hydrophobic polymers, waxes, fats, long-chain fatty acids, fatty alcohols or corresponding esters or ethers or mixtures thereof are also preferred. Mono- or diglycerides of C12-C30 fatty acids and/or C12-C30 fatty alcohols and/or waxes or mixtures thereof are particularly preferably used as hydrophobic materials.<br>
It is also possible to use mixtures of the above-stated hydrophilic and hydrophobic materials as matrix materials.<br>
Components (C) and the optionally present component (D), may furthermore also optionally serve as additional matrix materials.<br>
If the dosage form produced according to the invention is intended for oral administration, it may also preferably comprise a coating which is resistant to gastric juices and dissolves as a function of the pH value of the release environment. By means of this coating, it is possible to ensure that the dosage form produced according to the invention passes through the stomach undissolved and the active ingredient is only released in the intestines. The coating which is resistant to gastric juices preferably dissolves at a pH value of between 5 and 7.5. The dosage forms produced according to the invention may likewise be provided with delayed-release coatings.<br>
Corresponding materials and methods for the delayed release of active ingredients and for the application of gastric juice-resistant and/or delayed-release coatings are known to the person skilled in the art, for example from "Coated Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms - Fundamentals, Manufacturing Techniques, Biopharmaceutical Aspects, Test Methods and Raw Materials" by Kurt H. Bauer, K. Lehmann, Hermann P. Osterwald, Rothgang, Gerhart, 1st edition, 1998, Medpharm Scientific Publishers.

Method for determining breaking strength<br>
In order to verify whether a material may be used as component (C) or (D), the material is press-moulded to form a tablet with a diameter of 10 mm and a height of 5 mm using a force of 150 N at a temperature which at least corresponds to the softening point of the polymer and is determined with the assistance of a DSC diagram of the material. Using tablets produced in this manner, breaking strength is determined with the apparatus described below in accordance with the method for determining the breaking strength of tablets published in the European Pharmacopoeia 1997, page 143, 144, method no. 2.9.8. The apparatus used for the measurement is a "Zwick Z 2.5" materials tester, Fmax = 2.5 kN, draw max. 1150 mm with the setup comprising 1 column and 1 spindle, clearance behind of 100 mm, a test speed adjustable between 0.1 to 800 mm/min and testControl software. Measurement was performed using a pressure piston with screw-in inserts and a cylinder (diam. 10 mm), a force transducer, Fmax. 1 kN, diam. = 8 mm, class 0.5 from 10 N, class 1 from 2 N to ISO 7500-1, with manufacturer's test certificate M to DIN 55350-18 (Zwick gross force Fmax = 1.45 kN) (all apparatus from Zwick GmbH &amp; Co. KG, Ulm, Germany) with order no. BTC-FR 2.5 TH. D09 for the tester, order no. BTC-LC 0050N. P01 for the force transducer, order no. BO 70000 S06 for the centring device.<br>
Figure 3 shows the measurement of the breaking strength of a tablet, in particular the tablet (41) adjustment device (61) used for this purpose before and during the measurement. To this end, the tablet (4') is held between the upper pressure plate (1') and the lower pressure plate (31) of the force application apparatus (not shown) with the assistance of two 2-part clamping devices (21), which are in each case firmly fastened (not shown) with the upper and lower pressure plate once the spacing (51) necessary for accommodating and centring the tablet to be measured has been established. The spacing (5') may be established by moving the 2-part clamping devices horizontally outwards or inwards in each case on the pressure plate on which they are mounted.<br>
The tablets deemed to be,resistant to breaking under a specific load inc],ude not onlv those which have not broken but also those which may have suffered plastic deformation under the action of the force.<br>
The breaking strength of the dosage forms obtained according to the invention is determined by the stated measurement method, wherein dosage forms other than tablets are also tested.<br>
The invention is explained below with reference to Examples. These explanations are given merely by way of example and do not restrict the general concept of the invention.<br>
Exam ple. 1<br><br>
The components were mixed for 15 minutes in a free-fall mixer before the powder mixture was apportioned into a model BCG 10 planetary-gear extruder with four planetary spindles from LBB Bohle (Ennigerloh, Germany). Apportionment was performed gravimetrically at 3.0 kg per second. The extruder was fitted with an 8 mm diameter extrusion die. Extrusion was performed at a rotational speed of 28.6 rpm with a product temperature of approx. 88°C.<br>
Once the extruded strand had cooled to room temperature, it was cut into disks, the weight of which in each case corresponded to that of the finally formed tablet. The disks were converted into tablets in a model EKO eccentric press from EKO with the assistance of a tabletting tool comprising a round punch with a diameter of 10 mm and a radius of curvature of 8 mm.<br>
The breaking strength of the tablets was determined as stated in the present application. The tablets did not break when exposed to a force of 500 N. The tablets could not be comminuted using a hammer, nor with the assistance of a pestle and mortar.<br>
In vitro release of the active ingredient from the preparation was determined in a paddle stirrer apparatus with sinker in accordance with Pharm. Eur.. The temperature<br>
of the release medium was 37°C and the rotational speed.of the stirrer 75 min'1. The, release medium used was intestinal juice, pH 6.8. The quantity of active ingredient released in each case into the dissolution medium at any one time was determined by spectrophotometry.<br><br>
