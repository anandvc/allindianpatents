The invention relates to a process for producing structures superimposed on one<br>
another in a metal foil section and an apparatus for producing the same. Metal foil<br>
sections of this type are preferably used to construct honeycomb bodies that are used,<br>
for example, as exhaust-gas treatment components in exhaust systems of internal<br>
combustion engines.<br>
For the exhaust-gas treatment of mobile internal combustion engines, such as for<br>
example spark-ignition and diesel engines, it is known to arrange at least one exhaust-<br>
gas treatment component, which provides a relatively large surface area (such as what<br>
Is known as a honeycomb body), in the exhaust pipe. These components are if<br>
appropriate provided with an application-specific (e.g. adsorbing, catalytlcally active<br>
and/or other) coating, intimate contact with the exhaust gas flowing past being realized<br>
on account of the large surface area of the component. Examples of these components<br>
include filter elements for filtering out particulates contained In the exhaust gas,<br>
adsorbers for storing pollutants (e.g. NO*) contained in the exhaust gas for at least a<br>
limited time, catalytic converters (e.g. 3-way catalyst, oxidation catalyst, reduction<br>
catalyst, etc.), diffusors for influencing the flow of and/or swirling up the exhaust gas<br>
flowing through or also heating elements which heat the exhaust gas to a desired<br>
temperature in particular after an internal combustion engine cold start. The following<br>
support substrates have fundamentally proven suitable for the conditions of use in the<br>
exhaust system of an automobile: ceramic honeycomb bodies, extruded honeycomb<br>
bodies and honeycomb bodies made from metal foils. In view of the fact that these<br>
support substrates always need to be adapted to their corresponding function, high-<br>
temperature-resistant and<br><br>
corrosion-resistant metal foils represent especially<br>
suitable starting materials for their production.<br>
It ia known to produce honeycomb bodies using a<br>
plurality of at least partially structured metal<br>
sheets, which are then introduced into a housing and<br>
thereby form a support body which can be provided with<br>
one or more of the abovementloned coatings. The at<br>
least partially structured metal sheets are arranged in<br>
such a way as to form passages arranged substantially<br>
parallel to one another. To ensure this, some of the<br>
metal sheets are provided with a structure, for example<br>
a type of corrugation structure, sawtooth structure,<br>
square-wave structure, delta-wave structure, omega<br>
structure or the like.<br>
Furthermore, it is known to introduce a second<br>
structure into sheet-metal foils of this type, this<br>
second structure being intended in particular to<br>
prevent a laminar flow, with which gas exchange between<br>
regions of the exhaust-gas part-stream located in the<br>
center of a passage of this type and the, for example,<br>
catalytically active passage wall regions does not take<br>
place to a sufficient extent, from forming immediately<br>
after the exhaust gas has entered the honeycomb body.<br>
This second structure or microstructure provides flow-<br>
facing surfaces which are responsible for swirling up<br>
the exhaust-gas part-streams in the interior of a<br>
passage of this type. This leads to intensive mixing of<br>
the exhaust gas part-streams themselves, thereby<br>
ensuring intimate contact between the pollutants<br>
contained in the exhaust gas and the passage wall.<br>
Furthermore, it is possible to use second structures of<br>
this type to form flow ducts running transversely to<br>
the passage, allowing gas exchange between exhaust-gas<br>
part-streams in adjacent passages. For this reason, it<br>
is known to use microstmctures which comprise, for<br>
example, guide surfaces, studs, projections, vanes,<br>
tabs, holes or the like. In this respect, there is a<br><br>
very considerable range of variation when producing<br>
metallic honeycomb bodies of this type compared to<br>
honeycomb bodies made from ceramic material, since such<br>
complex passage walls cannot be realized, or can only<br>
be realized with a particularly high level of technical<br>
outlay, using ceramic material.<br>
These metal sheets provided with structures are then<br>
stacked (if appropriate alternately with smooth<br>
interlayers between them), intertwined and inserted<br>
into a housing, leading to the formation of a honeycomb<br>
body which has passages that are substantially parallel<br>
to one another.<br>
Furthermore, in the context of exhaust-gas treatment it<br>
is of particular interest for pollutants contained in<br>
the exhaust gas to be converted virtually immediately<br>
after the internal combustion engine has started up.<br>
This should take place with a particularly high<br>
efficiency in accordance with statutory stipulations<br>
and guidelines. For this reason, ever thinner metal<br>
sheets have been used in the past. These thinner sheets<br>
provide a very low area-specific heat capacity, i.e.<br>
relatively little heat is withdrawn from the exhaust<br>
gas flowing past, or the temperature of the metal<br>
sheets themselves rises relatively quickly. This is<br>
important because the catalytically active coatings<br>
which are currently used in the exhaust system only<br>
start to convert the pollutants above a certain light-<br>
off temperature, which is approximately 230°C to 270°C.<br>
With a view to converting these pollutants with at<br>
least a 98% efficiency after just a few seconds, metal<br>
sheets with a thickness of, for example, less than<br>
0.1 mm, in particular even less than 0.05 mm, are used.<br>
However, the abovementioned objectives give rise to a<br>
number of manufacturing technology and application-<br>
related problems. For example, it should be noted that<br>
under certain circumstances the targeted setting of an<br><br>
exhaust gas flow profile in the honeycomb body requires<br>
precise alignment of the microstructures in the<br>
passages. Furthermore, it should be borne in mind that<br>
metal foils of this type are connected to one another<br>
by joining techniques, in particular are soldered<br>
together (by brazing, if appropriate under a vacuum)<br>
and/or are welded to one another. However, this<br>
presupposes the presence of defined contact regions<br>
between the metal foils. This in turn means that it is<br>
necessary to ensure that the structures which are<br>
superimposed on one another are aligned as accurately<br>
as possible. Hitherto, it has not been possible to<br>
ensure this with a sufficient level of accuracy. On<br>
account of external influences involved in the<br>
production of the structures, such as for example<br>
vibrations excited in the metal foils, deviations occur<br>
in the drawing and/or forming properties of the metal<br>
foil. Manufacturing inaccuracies or tolerances within<br>
the tools (such as for example true-running errors,<br>
positioning errors, contour errors in rolling teeth,<br>
etc.) lead to undesirable deviations in the positions<br>
of the structures with respect to one another which<br>
periodically fluctuate. Moreover, inliomogeneities in<br>
the material used for the metal foils can lead to<br>
further deviations in the structures with respect to<br>
one another.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to at least<br>
partially alleviate the technical problems which have<br>
been outlined in connection with the prior art. In<br>
particular, it is intended to provide a process for<br>
producing multiply structured metal foils of this type<br>
which ensures that the structures which are<br>
superimposed on one another are aligned as accurately<br>
as possible with respect to one another. The process is<br>
also to satisfy the demands of series production for<br>
metal foils of this type and to represent a time-saving<br>
and cost-saving route. Furthermore, it is intended to<br>
provide an apparatus for producing metal foils of this<br><br><br>
type, The metal foils produced by the process and/or the apparatus are to have a<br>
particularly accurate alignment of the structures which are superimposed on one<br>
another and are to be used In particular to produce durable honeycomb bodies which<br>
can be used in the exhaust system of internal combustion engines.<br>
These objects are achieved by the process of producing superimposed primary and<br>
secondary structures and by the apparatus for producing the same. Further<br>
advantageous configurations of the process and apparatus are given in the dependent<br>
patent claims. The invention also proposes a metal foil section produced by the process<br>
and/or the apparatus and a honeycomb body produced therefrom. The features listed<br>
individually In the patent claims can be combined with one another in any technically<br>
appropriate way and can be supplemented by explanatory statements from the<br>
description, thereby demonstrating further variant embodiments of the invention.<br>
The process according to the invention for producing structures which are<br>
superimposed on one another in a metal foil section includes at least the following<br>
steps:<br>
a)	producing a primary structure using a first tool;<br>
b)	transferring the metal foil section to a second tool, the second tool having at<br>
least one shaping profiled roller which is responsible for transferring the metal<br>
foil section;<br>
c)	producing a secondary structure using the second tool;<br>
d)	determining a spatial position of primary structure and secondary structure in at<br>
least one subreglon of the metal foil section;<br><br><br>
e) detecting an incorrect position and adapting an<br>
operating parameter of the at least one<br>
profiled roller.<br>
It is customary for structures of this type to be<br>
produced in a continuous process (or with a frequency<br>
of greater than 1 advancing step per second), with the<br>
metal foil being unrolled from a coil and fed to the<br>
tools. Therefore, the process outlined here considers a<br>
metal foil section which is deformed. Accordingly, the<br>
metal foil section is initially smooth and is fed to<br>
the first tool to produce a primary structure. The<br>
primary structure is in this case preferably a<br>
microstructure, i.e. for example an embossed or stamped<br>
formation, which extends only over a small region of<br>
the metal foil section and is intended in particular to<br>
influence the subsequent flow of the exhaust gas in the<br>
passage. In addition, a primary structure of this type<br>
may also represent a preparatory measure for the<br>
subsequent formation of (other or further)<br>
microstructures, for example slots, at which subregions<br>
of the metal foil are subsequently deformed so as to<br>
produce guide surfaces or the like.<br>
As explained in step b), the metal foil section is<br>
transferred by a profiled roller of the second tool. In<br>
other words, the second tool pulls the metal foil<br>
section through the first tool. Although it is also<br>
possible for apparatuses for clamping and/or guiding<br>
the metal foil section to be provided upstream of the<br>
first tool and/or between the first tool and the second<br>
tool, the advance of the metal foil section at the<br>
desired velocity or cycle rate is determined by the<br>
profiled roller.<br>
In addition to the shaping, i.e. the production of a<br>
secondary structure (step c)), the profiled roller also<br>
has a transporting function for the metal foil section.<br>
Engagement of the profiled roller in the secondary<br><br>
structure of the metal foil section allows a force to<br>
be introduced parallel to the direction of advance of<br>
the metal foil section, with the rotational speed of<br>
the profiled roller determining the speed of advance of<br>
the metal foil section.<br>
After the primary structure and the secondary structure<br>
(as well as any further structures) have been formed,<br>
in accordance with step d) the spatial position of<br>
these structures which are superimposed on one another<br>
is then recorded. In this step, it is preferable to in<br>
each case record reference points of the primary<br>
structure and the secondary structure and to evaluate<br>
the position of these reference points with respect to<br>
one another. It is possible for their position with<br>
respect to one another to be recorded in one or more<br>
planes (parallel, perpendicular and/or oblique with<br>
respect to the surface of the smooth metal foil<br>
section). In particular center points and/or center<br>
lines of the primary structure are recommended as<br>
reference points for the primary structure. By way of<br>
example, the extremities of the secondary structure,<br>
such as for example the . corrugation peaks or<br>
corrugation valleys in the case of a corrugated<br>
structure, are recommended as reference points for the<br>
secondary structure.<br>
After the spatial position of primary structure and<br>
secondary structure has been determined, their spatial<br>
position is evaluated. In this context, it is possible<br>
to predetermine different tolerance ranges or limit<br>
values, which differentiate an acceptable position<br>
(correct position) and an incorrect position from one<br>
another. If the result of step d) is that an incorrect<br>
position is present, at least one operating parameter<br>
of the at least one profiled roller is then altered in<br>
accordance with step e). A suitable operating parameter<br>
is in particular the rotational speed of the profiled<br>
roller, although under certain circumstances it is also<br><br>
possible to carry out adaptations by varying the<br>
position of the profiled roller with respect to other<br>
components of the second tool, in particular a further<br>
profiled roller. Adaptation of this nature leads to the<br>
shaping profile of the profiled roller being realigned<br>
with respect to the distance to the first tool, thereby<br>
altering the position of the secondary structure in the<br>
metal foil section relative to the primary structure.<br>
This brings about accurate alignment of primary<br>
structure and secondary structure. The process proposed<br>
here allows highly dynamic control of the process for<br>
producing metal foils of this type with structures<br>
which are superimposed on one another, in which it is<br>
possible to automatically react quickly to material<br>
inhomogeneities, external disruptions or the like.<br>
Furthermore, it is proposed that the at least one<br>
profiled roller is operated at an angular velocity<br>
which is altered in step e). The profiled rollers used<br>
to produce the secondary structure have hitherto been<br>
operated at a constant angular velocity, with one<br>
revolution of the profiled roller if appropriate being<br>
divided into a multiplicity of rotation angle sections<br>
or increments and rotation continuing by a constant<br>
number of increments at predetermined time intervals.<br>
The present invention now departs from this procedure.<br>
If an incorrect position is detected, a correction is<br>
achieved by virtue of either continuing to rotate for a<br>
selected, constant number of increments but in an<br>
altered time interval and/or by the number of<br>
increments being varied while maintaining a constant<br>
time interval. In view of the fact that control of this<br>
nature is only launched when an incorrect position is<br>
detected, phases during which a constant angular<br>
velocity is present may also occur during the process,<br>
so that under certain circumstances a relatively long<br>
period of time (for example 5 minutes) needs to be<br>
considered with regard to a varying angular velocity.<br><br>
However, it is particularly advantageous if step d) is<br>
carried out at least once per revolution of the at<br>
least one profiled roller. This means that a check of<br>
the spatial position of primary structure and secondary<br>
structure is carried out at the latest after every<br>
revolution of the profiled roller. This has the<br>
advantage that this control system is highly dynamic<br>
and can also react quickly to faults, such as for<br>
example the occurrence of vibrations.<br>
It is also preferable if step e) is carried out at<br>
least once per revolution of the profiled roller. It is<br>
in this case possible for the adapting of the at least<br>
one operating parameter of the at least one profiled<br>
roller to be controlled in such a way that the<br>
incorrect position is corrected at the latest after one<br>
revolution, in particular if step d) is carried out<br>
only after each revolution. However, for an even more<br>
dynamic control system, it is advantageous for steps d)<br>
and e) to be carried out a number of times per<br>
revolution of the profiled roller in order for a<br>
correction to take place in less than one revolution of<br>
the profiled roller. In the latter case, steps d) and<br>
e) are preferably carried out at least twice and in<br>
particular at least four times per revolution of the<br>
profiled roller.<br>
If the position of the profiled roller with respect to<br>
other components can be altered as operating parameter,<br>
the configuration of the secondary structure is<br>
altered. This means, for example, that the shaping<br>
sections of the profiled rollers engage in one another<br>
to a greater extent and the secondary structure is<br>
thereby produced with a greater height. This leads to a<br>
higher demand for material per segment of secondary<br>
structure, so that in this way it is likewise possible<br>
to shift the position of the primary structure and<br>
secondary structure relative to one another. With a<br>
view to the production of a honeycomb body, this leads<br><br>
to the formation of passages with different passage<br>
cross sections, which may be advantageous in certain<br>
applications. However, to accurately influence the flow<br>
properties of the exhaust gas in the honeycomb body in<br>
this way, very accurate control of the position of the<br>
profiled rollers is required.<br>
According to a preferred configuration of the process,<br>
step a) comprises the stamping of openings and step c)<br>
comprises the shaping of corrugations into the metal<br>
foil section. The openings may be designed as slots,<br>
holes or the like. The corrugations are substantially<br>
characterized by corrugation peaks and corrugation<br>
valleys, with the openings being aligned with respect<br>
to these corrugation peaks and corrugation valleys. In<br>
this case, it is preferable for the spatial position of<br>
the openings and corrugations in the direction of<br>
advance and in a plane of the metal foil section to be<br>
determined and adapted. Although this is a preferred<br>
variant, it is in particular also possible for openings<br>
to be introduced into the metal foil section by means<br>
of a rotary stamping tool and/or a laser. In principle,<br>
it is also possible for a plurality of primary<br>
structures or openings to be introduced simultaneously,<br>
so that after step a) the metal foil section has a<br>
plurality of rows of primary structures or openings.<br>
Furthermore, it is proposed that an incorrect position<br>
involves a position shift from primary structure to<br>
secondary structure of greater than 0.3 mm. This<br>
produces a limit value used to distinguish a correct<br>
position from an incorrect position. The position shift<br>
is preferably considered in the direction of advance of<br>
the metal foil section. The reference points used for<br>
the primary structure and the secondary structure may<br>
be their center points or center lines. If the primary<br>
structure is formed by openings designed as slots,<br>
their center line should be parallel to the profile of<br>
the corrugation peaks or corrugation valleys. The<br><br>
maximum position shift which is still permissible from<br>
primary structure to secondary structure is preferably<br>
below an absolute value of 0.2 nun, in particular below<br>
0.1 mm.<br>
According to a further configuration of the process,<br>
the detection of an incorrect position ia carried out<br>
by means of at least one optical sensor. This optical<br>
sensor is arranged downstream of the second tool (or a<br>
subsequent tool) and therefore observes the spatial<br>
position of the primary structure and secondary<br>
structure which have currently been formed. A<br>
recommended optical sensor is in particular a camera,<br>
the picture resolution (pixels) of which permits the<br>
determination of a position shift. These pixels can be<br>
used, for example, to determine the position shift and<br>
to effect a corresponding adjustment to the angular<br>
velocity of the at least one profiled roller.<br>
A further aspect of the invention proposes an apparatus<br>
for producing structures which are superimposed on one<br>
another, comprising at least the following components:<br>
a first tool, which is able to produce openings in<br>
a metal foil section,<br>
a second tool, which has a pair of shaping<br>
profiled rollers through which a metal foil<br>
section can be passed to produce corrugations, the<br>
pair of profiled rollers being able to effect an<br>
advance of the metal foil section through the<br>
first tool and the second tool,<br>
an appliance for driving at least one profiled<br>
roller of the second tool,<br>
at least one optical sensor which is connected<br>
downstream of the second tool as seen in a<br>
direction of advance, and<br>
at least one control unit, which is connected to<br>
the sensor and the appliance.<br><br>
This apparatus is suitable in particular for carrying<br>
out a process which has been described in accordance<br>
with the invention.<br>
In the apparatus described here, the first tool is<br>
preferably a stamping machine which removes subregiona<br>
of the metal foil section. The second tool is<br>
preferably a corrugation rolling machine. Electric<br>
motors or servomotors may be advantageous as the<br>
appliance for driving at least one profiled roller. It<br>
is preferable for the at least one profiled roller to<br>
be driven with a frequency of greater than 6 Hz<br>
[1/second], in particular greater than 8 Hz or even<br>
12 Hz. The at least one optical sensor preferably<br>
comprises a camera. The at least one control unit<br>
evaluates the data from the at least one optical sensor<br>
and determines a spatial position of primary structure<br>
and secondary structure. Moreover, the control unit<br>
detects an incorrect position and then adapts an<br>
operating parameter of the appliance used to drive the<br>
at least one profiled roller. The control unit may<br>
comprise image recognition means, data processing<br>
programs, memory elements and the like.<br>
Preference is given to an apparatus in which the at<br>
least one sensor is configured in such a way that it<br>
has a variable detection field. This is to be<br>
understood in particular as meaning that the detection<br>
field can be positioned variably with respect to the<br>
metal foil section. This preferably ensures a movement<br>
of the detection field in the direction of advance or<br>
perpendicular to the direction of advance, it being<br>
possible for this movement to be realized by<br>
translational movements and/or by pivoting of the<br>
sensor. It is in this way also possible to record major<br>
position shifts (as may occur for example when starting<br>
the production process or during a material change).<br>
Moreover, it is possible to use a single sensor to<br>
record the reference points for the primary structure<br><br>
and the secondary structure at various regions of the<br>
metal foil section. It is in this way possible to keep<br>
the technical outlay involved in determining the<br>
spatial position of primary structure and secondary<br>
structure at a low level.<br>
Furthermore, it is proposed that the at least one<br>
sensor is assigned a measuring roller which positions a<br>
metal foil section with respect to the at least one<br>
sensor. The measuring roller, which does not itself<br>
effect any permanent deformation of the structures, but<br>
rather is merely responsible for accurately guiding the<br>
metal foil section, produces, for example, an accurate<br>
alignment of the secondary structure with respect to<br>
the sensor. The measuring roller may in this case be<br>
provided with a separate drive or a drive coupled to<br>
the appliance. Measuring roller and sensor are<br>
preferably located on opposite sides of the processed<br>
metal foil section and are in particular arranged<br>
aligned with one another.<br>
According to a further configuration of the apparatus,<br>
illumination means are provided, which partially<br>
irradiate at least one side of the metal foil section<br>
in the detection field of the sensor. By way of<br>
example, there may be illumination means which are<br>
positioned on the remote side of the metal foil section<br>
and radiate through openings (opposite light) and/or<br>
illumination means which are arranged on the same side<br>
of the metal foil section as the sensor, in order to at<br>
least partially illuminate the detection field which<br>
can be seen by the sensor (incident light).<br>
The invention now also proposes a metal foil section<br>
which has been produced by a process according to the<br>
invention or using an apparatus according to the<br>
invention and which has a length of greater than 1 m,<br>
with a maximum position shift of 0.3 mm between primary<br>
structure and secondary structure. It is preferable for<br><br>
a maximum position shift of this type to be present<br>
over significantly greater lengths, for example over<br>
100 m or 1000 m. The process according to the invention<br>
and the apparatus according to the invention for the<br>
first time allow production of such accurate metal<br>
foils over such a length. Therefore, such accurate<br>
metal foils can be provided even in series production,<br>
ensuring a high yield of material at a high production<br>
rate.<br>
In this context, it is particularly preferable for the<br>
metal foil section to have a thickness in the range<br>
from 30 µm (0.03 mm) to 150 µm (0.15 mm) and a<br>
secondary structure with a ratio of width to height of<br>
less than 2.0, in particular even less than 1.5.<br>
Therefore, it has proven appropriate for the apparatus<br>
and/or the process to be used for deformation of very<br>
thin, filigree structures. The width/height ratio<br>
indicates that a relatively considerable deformation of<br>
the metal foil section is realized, with in particular<br>
the regions of the corrugation peaks and corrugation<br>
valleys being very small, and therefore accurate<br>
alignment of primary structure, and secondary structure<br>
in the manner described above being advantageous.<br>
It is very particularly preferable to construct a<br>
honeycomb body using at least one metal foil section of<br>
this type. In particular in the case of honeycomb<br>
bodies of helical construction, metal foil sections of<br>
a great length have to be processed, so that in<br>
particular in this case it is appropriate to use metal<br>
foil sections of this type. The thickness indicated for<br>
the metal foil section allows the provision of a large<br>
surface area within a small volume of the honeycomb<br>
body, and the width/height ratio is responsible for<br>
slender passages which ensure good mass transfer of the<br>
flowing exhaust gas toward the (coated) walls.<br><br>
The invention and the technical background are<br>
explained in more detail below with reference to the<br>
figures. The figures show particularly preferred<br>
exemplary embodiments, although without the invention<br>
being restricted to these embodiments. In particular,<br>
it should be noted that the size ratios illustrated are<br>

Fig. 1 diagrammatically depicts the process for<br>
producing a multiply structured metal foil section 1.<br>
The following description is substantially based on the<br>
direction of advance 13, with the metal foil section 1<br>
being unwound from a coil 24 and then passing through a<br><br>
first tool 3 and a second tool 4 before being examined<br>
by means of a sensor 11 and a measuring roller 16 and<br>
finally being fed to a third tool 27. The shaping of<br>
the metal foil section 1 is then concluded, so that the<br>
desired metal foil section 1 can finally be severed by<br>
means of a separation apparatus 28.<br>
The coil 24 is a type of store for metal foil which is<br>
wound up helically. The coil 24 is generally driven and<br>
has a compensation element, for example what is known<br>
as a dancer (not shown), which compensates for<br>
fluctuations in the rate of advance of the metal foil<br>
section 1, connected downstream of it. Thereafter, the<br>
metal foil section 1 is passed via a foil brake 25,<br>
which ensures sufficient tensioning by the point of the<br>
advancing drive of the metal foil section 1. The foil<br>
brake 25 is preferably a type of felt belt, which is if<br>
appropriate moved counter to the direction of advance<br>
13. To ensure that the metal foil section 1 bears<br>
reliably against the foil brake 25, the latter may be<br>
realized by a permanent magnet (not illustrated). Under<br>
certain circumstances, it may be advantageous for the<br>
supply of the metal foil section 1 to the first tool 3<br>
to be controlled by means of the foil brake 25 likewise<br>
as a function of the produced position of primary<br>
structure and secondary structure, which can be<br>
effected separately and/or in addition to the control<br>
by means of the profiled roller 5.<br>
The second tool 4 is designed with a pair of profiled<br>
rollers 5 rotating with a predetermined rotation angle<br>
39 or a predetermined rotational speed. For this<br>
purpose, at least one of the shaping profiled rollers 5<br>
is designed with an appliance 12 as its drive. This<br>
appliance 12 is also responsible for transporting the<br>
metal foil section 1 from the foil brake 25 to the<br>
first tool 3. A foil guide 26, which is responsible,<br>
for example, for perpendicular feeding of the metal<br>
foil section 1 as far as the profiled rollers 5, is<br><br>
provided between the first tool 3 and the second<br>
tool 4.<br>
The first tool 3 is preferably a stamping machine<br>
working on the reciprocating motion principle, the<br>
reciprocating motion of the plunger 50 being effected<br>
by means of an eccentric 48. The stamping machine ie<br>
able, for example, to introduce slots with dimensions<br>
of 2.5 x 0.8 mm into the smooth metal foil section 1.<br>
The material which is stamped out is removed by means<br>
of a suction extractor 49 located opposite.<br>
After the metal foil section 1 has then been provided<br>
with a primary structure (not illustrated here, cf.<br>
Fig. 2) by the first tool 3 and with, a secondary<br>
structure 6 by the second tool 4, it is fed to an<br>
arrangement with an optical sensor 11 which determines<br>
a spatial position of primary structure and secondary<br>
structure in a subregion 7 of the metal foil section 1.<br>
The sensor 11 is assigned a measuring roller 16 on the<br>
opposite side of the metal foil section 1, which<br>
measuring roller 16 is itself driven, the drive 51<br>
preferably being connected via a coupling to the<br>
appliance 12 used to drive the profiled roller 5, for<br>
example via a belt (not illustrated). Moreover,<br>
illumination means 18 are positioned on the side of the<br>
sensor 11 for at least partially lighting up the<br>
subregion 7 (incident light).<br>
The image generated by the optical sensor 11 is<br>
processed in a control unit 14, which for example<br>
recognizes an incorrect position. If it recognizes an<br>
incorrect position, the control unit 14 adapts at least<br>
one operating parameter of the profiled roller 5 of the<br>
second tool 4, for example by influencing the driving<br>
appliance 12 and altering the angular velocity. •<br>
After it has left the appliance for determining the<br>
spatial position of primary structure and secondary<br><br>
structure, the metal foil section 1 is fed via a<br>
further foil guide 26 to a third tool 27, which<br>
likewise comprises a pair of profiled rollers 5. This<br>
third tool 27 introduces a tertiary structure (not<br>
illustrated here, cf. Pig. 2) into the metal foil<br>
section 1 before the metal foil section 1 is cut to the<br>
desired length by means of a separation apparatus 28.<br>
The process illustrated here can be used to introduce<br>
particularly complex structures into a metal foil<br>
section while at the same time ensuring a high degree<br>
of accuracy over a prolonged period of time during<br>
series production of metal foil sections of this type.<br>
Fig. 2 diagrammatically depicts a metal foil section 1<br>
as is present in different region's of the apparatus<br>
shown in Fig. 1. From left to right in Fig. 2, it is<br>
possible to recognize first of all a smooth region, ae<br>
is present for example in the region of the foil brake<br>
25. The metal foil section 1 is then provided with a<br>
primary structure 2, in this case slots, in the region<br>
of the first tool 3. Thereafter, as illustrated further<br>
to the right, the secondary structure 6 is introduced<br>
in the region of the second tool 4; in the variant<br>
embodiment illustrated here, the primary structure 2 is<br>
arranged on each corrugation peak 31. The secondary<br>
structure 6 is produced with a width 22, which<br>
describes the distance between two adjacent corrugation<br>
peaks 31 or corrugation valleys 32, and a predetermined<br>
height 23, the height 23 describing the distance<br>
between a corrugation peak 31 and a corrugation valley<br>
32. After the metal foil section 1 hag left the second<br>
tool 2, a tertiary structure 29 is formed in the region<br>
of the third tool 27; in the variant embodiment<br>
illustrated, this involves a region of the metal foil<br>
section 1 between two adjacent primary structures 2<br>
being pressed in. In this way, what is known as a<br>
microstructure is formed, which is subsequently to<br>
constitute a guide surface, projecting into a passage,<br>
for an exhaust-gas stream.<br><br>
Fig. 3 illustrates a metal foil section 1 (in plan<br>
view) of a predetermined length 20. The upper part of<br>
Fig. 3 reveals an accurate alignment of the openings 8<br>
with respect to the corrugation peaks 31. In the lower<br>
part of the figure, it can be seen that the openings 8<br>
are not accurately aligned with respect to the<br>
corrugation 9. A center 32 of the opening 8 has a<br>
position shift 10 with respect to the corrugation peak<br>
31. The lower part of the figure also illustrates that<br>
the position shift 10 is becoming smaller from left to<br>
right, since the control has detected the incorrect<br>
position and adapted an operating parameter of the<br>
profiled roller. In this way, a correct position is<br>
achieved again after just a few corrugation peaks 31 or<br>
corrugation valleys 32.<br>
Fig. 4 diagrammatically depicts the positioning of an<br>
optical sensor 11 with respect to the metal foil<br>
section 1, which is formed with a predetermined<br>
thickness 21. As indicated diagrammatically here, the<br>
optical sensor 11 has a viewing direction 33 which<br>
describes its detection field 15. To scan different<br>
subregions of the metal foil section 1, it is possible<br>
to vary the detection field 15 with respect to the<br>
metal foil section 1. This is possible by the sensor 11<br>
having a pivot angle 34 for pivoting the viewing<br>
direction 30 and by virtue of the fact that the sensor<br>
11 can be moved in different directions of movement 35<br>
relative to the metal foil section 1. In the variant<br>
embodiment illustrated, illumination means 18, by means<br>
of which the opening 8 can be detected in opposing<br>
light, are provided on the opposite side 19 of the<br>
metal foil section 1 from the sensor 11. It is<br>
preferable for a reference point determination to be<br>
carried out by means of the sensor 11 in such a way<br>
that the position of the opening 8 is detected in<br>
opposing light in a first subsection of the detection<br>
field 15, while the position of the corrugation peak 31<br><br>
is detected by incident light in another subregjon of<br>
the detection field 15.<br>
Fig. 5 diagrammatically depicts a position shift 10<br>
over the rotation angle 39 of the shaping and<br>
transporting profiled roller 5. A first curve 37<br>
illustrates the position shift 10 as was usually<br>
established in processes known hitherto as a result of<br>
position tolerances, material inhomogeneities, etc. A<br>
first curve 3 7 of this type, as also occurs from time<br>
to time in known apparatus, is characterized in<br>
particular by periodic fluctuations which are<br>
attributable in particular to tolerances in the region<br>
of the second tool and recur with the revolutions of<br>
the profiled rollers. In the second, lower curve 38,<br>
the position shift 10 varies to only a very small<br>
extent about the abscissa (corresponding to a position<br>
shift of 0 mm). This curve 38 can be moved even closer<br>
to the abscissa if the control system is made even more<br>
dynamic. By way of example, an external fault 36 (e.g.<br>
excited vibrations) has been applied here during<br>
production. As can be seen, a relatively major position<br>
shift 10 occurs initially, but this has been<br>
compensated for again after just a short time or after<br>
a short rotational movement of the profiled roller.<br>
The preferred use of metal foil sections 1 which have<br>
been produced by the process according to the invention<br>
and/or using the apparatus according to the invention<br>
is for exhaust-gas treatment units 45 for use for<br>
purifying exhaust gases from mobile or stationary<br>
internal combustion engines. An example of an exhaust-<br>
gas treatment unit 45 of this type is illustrated in<br>
Fig. 6. The exhaust-gas treatment unit 45 comprises a<br>
housing 44 in which a honeycomb body 40 is provided. In<br>
the variant embodiment shown, the honeycomb body 4 0 is<br>
constructed with a corrugated layer 41 and a smooth<br>
layer 42, which have been wound up helically. The<br>
corrugated layer 41 has structures which are<br><br>
superimposed on one another; the secondary structure 6,<br>
i.e. the corrugation shape, can be seen in this end-<br>
side view. This corrugation shape forms passages 43<br>
through which the exhaust gas can enter inner regions<br>
of the honeycomb body 40. A detail (denoted by VII) of<br>
this honeycomb body 40 is illustrated in Fig. 7.<br>
Fig. 7 shows an end-side view of the honeycomb body 40<br>
in detail. The smooth layer 42 is realized using a<br>
filter material, while the corrugated layer 41<br>
comprises a metal foil section 1 of the type described<br>
above. The corrugated layer 41 and the smooth layer 42<br>
form contact locations 46, which are used, for example,<br>
to provide connections produced by a joining technique<br>
and to delimit adjacent passages 43 from one another.<br>
At at least some of these contact locations 46, the<br>
corrugated layer 41 and the smooth layer 42 are<br>
connected to one another, preferably by brazing. The<br>
walls which delimit the passages 43 and are formed by<br>
the smooth layer 42 and the corrugated layer 41 are<br>
provided with a coating 47 for catalytically converting<br>
the exhaust gases.<br>
The invention described above is suitable in particular<br>
for the production of multiply superimposed structures<br>
in a metal foil section with a high degree of precision<br>
being achieved. This allows considerable cost savings<br>
to be made with regard to the production of metal foils<br>
of this type and also allows a considerable increase in<br>
efficiency and long-term durability of honeycomb bodies<br>
constructed using metal foils of this type to be<br>
achieved.<br><br>
