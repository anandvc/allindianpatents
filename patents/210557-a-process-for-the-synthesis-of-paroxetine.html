PROCESS FOR THE PRODUCTION OF PAROXETINE Field of the invention<br>
The field of the present invention is the synthesis of optically active compounds. A<br>
highly stereospecific process for synthesis of paroxetine is described herein.<br>
Prior art<br>
Paroxetine is a compound widely used for the treatment of depression.<br>
The structural formula of this compound is as follows (I):<br><br>
The molecule of formula (I) contains two chiral centres on the piperidinic ring, in position 3 and 4, respectively. Of the four possible isomers, only the isomer having absolute configuratron '3S. 4R, known as 4R-trans-4-(D-fluoroDhenvl-3-{ [3.4-(methylenedioxy)phenoxy)methyl} piperidine, is pharmacologically active. Therefore, the processes for synthesis of paroxetine must result in the formation of the 4-(p-fluorophenyl-3-{ [3,4-(methylenedioxy)phenoxy]methyl} piperidinic structure, exclusively in the aforesaid conformation, 3S, 4R (or 4R-trans). Some processes for synthesis of paroxetine known to the art are based on the formation of an intermediate of formula (II)<br><br><br>
(11)<br>
where R represents an alkyl group. Starting from this intermediate, the product of formula (I) is obtained by: (i) reduction of the piperidinic double bond, (ii) alkylation of the oxygen of the hydroxymethyl group, and (iii) removal of the alkyl group R bound to the nitrogen. In order to obtain the product (I) with the pharmacologically active conformation, the process requires the isolation of specific isomers from the corresponding racemic mixtures and the treatment of the same until obtaining derivative (I) with the desired conformation.<br>
For example, patent application WO-A-9636636 discloses the synthesis of 4-arylpiperidine. wherein a derivative of formula (II) is separated into the two optical isomers by Crystallisation with optically active salts. The two optical isomers are then separately converted into paroxetine. Therefore, the process requires separate and independent synthesis routes for isomers treatment and, consequently, can hardly be scaled up to commercial size. According to another process (J. Labelled Compounds Radiopharm., 1993. 8, 785). the derivative of formula (II) is hydrogenated and alkylated as per the above scheme; subsequently the diastereoisomers are isolated by chromatography while the enantiomers are separated by crystallisation with L-(+)-tartaric acid. The (-)-trans isomer is finally converted into paroxetine by N-dealkylation. In this case, two distinct isomers separation cycles are required, resulting in a considerable loss of product in the form of undesired isomer. Consequently, this process too<br><br>
can hardly be applied to commercial-scale production.<br>
The process disclosed in patent application WO-A-9322284 is based on the stereospecificity of esterase-catalysed reactions. In this case, the enzyme brings about the formation of a trans carboxylic precursor, wherefrom the (+)-trans and {')'trans forms are separated by conventional methods. The latter form further undergoes reduction and alkylation to give paroxetine. The advantage of this process is a high stereospecificity; its disadvantages are the enzyme cost and instability. The aforesaid reactions are usually slow and must be carried out under precise pH and temperature conditions.<br>
In brief, the separation processes known to the art cause a considerable loss of product in the form of isomers with undesired configuration or require separate process cycles for the conversion of said isomers. In particular, the processes known to the art entail the resolution of racemic mixtures in which the dextro- and levorotatory components are present in substantially similar proportions, with the result that approx. half of the resolved product is to be discarded or independently converted into the desired form-Therefore, the need for developing highly stereospecific processes for the synthesis of paroxetine, whereby the desired isomers are obtained in high yields, is felt. Particularly urgent is the need for processes not involving isomer resolution cycles and not requiring separate ad hoc treatments of the single isomers. Description of the figures<br>

Detailed description of the invention<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a process for the synthesis of paroxetine. The process comprises the following steps:<br>
a)	hydrogenation of a compound of formula (II), where R is a group selected from<br>
(C1-C5)alkyl. (C1-C5)carboxyalkyl. an optionally substituted phenyl, an optionally<br>
substituted benzyl, said hydrogenation being catalysed by a complex of a<br>
transition metal with chiral diphosphinic ligands, resulting in a 4R-<br>
enantiomerically enriched compound of formula (III):<br><br>
b)	reaction of the compound of formula (III) with a reagent capable of transforming<br>
the -OM group into a leaving group, followed by nucleophilic substitution with<br>
sesamol (3,4-methylenedioxyphenol), resulting In a 4R-enantiomerically enriched<br>
derivative of formula (IV);<br><br><br>
In formula (II), R preferably represents an ethyl group should R represent an optionally substituted phenyl or benzyl, the substituent is preferably a (C,-C 5) alkyl.<br>
The compound of formula (III) obtained in step a) contains two asymmetry centres on the piperidinic ring, in position 3 and 4, respectively. Said product is obtained as a mixture of 4R-enantiomerically enriched cis (IIIa) and trans (lllb) isomers, where each of the two isomers {cis and trans) is mainly present in the form having absolute configuration R on the carbon atom in position 4 of the piperidinic ring. By the term "4R-enantiomerically enriched" It is meant an overall enantiomeric excess (also called overall "ee") of at least 80%. The enantiomeric excesses are calculated as described in J. March, "Advanced Organic Chemistry", 3rd Ed.,<br><br>
Chapter 4, p. 107 (John Wiley &amp; Sons) (1985).<br>
The catalysts to be used in hydrogenation (step a) are compounds belonging to the class of transition metal complexes with chiral diphosphinic ligands. Said catalysts   are   responsible  for the   reaction   stereospecificity   and   allow  the obtainment of 4R-enantiomerically enriched derivative of formula (III). Members of this class are all the transition metal complexes with chiral diphosphinic ligands. In said complexes, the metal coordinates to the chiral ligand to give a chiral complex capable of catalysing a highly stereospecific hydrogenation of the double bond. Preferred transition metals are ruthenium, rhodium and iridium. Examples of chiral diphosphinic ligands are the compounds belonging to the  formulas indicated in Figure 1. Examples of transition metal complexes with chiral diphosphinic ligands are the compounds of formula RuX|(L)JBINAP]Yn. described in the patent application EP-A-366390. or the compounds of formula<br>
described in EP-A-245959. Preferred complexes are the compounds: {RuCI(p-cymene)[BINAP]}CI; RuHCI[BINAP]2; Ru2CU[(BINAP]2NEt3; Ru(BINAP](OAc)2; Ru[BINAP](CF3C02)2. and the compounds of formulas<br><br><br>

compounds of formula RuX,(L)JBINAP]Yn, described in the patent application EP-<br>
A-366390, or the compounds of formula <br>
described in EP-A-245959. Preferred complexes are the compounds: {RuCI(p-<br>

Ru[BINAP](CF3C02)2, and the compounds of formulas<br><br><br><br><br><br>
and the compounds of formula {Ru(p-cymene)X[BINAP]}+X'. where X represents a halogen atom, such as the compound (Ru(p-cymene)CI[BINAP] }*Cr. As mentioned above, all these complexes are chiral; depending on each complex, only one of the chiral forms, e.g. (S)BINAP or (R)BINAP generates in the 4R-enriched product: this form is not determinable a priori, but can be easily selected by performing a screening hydrogenation test of compound (11), with the ligand in one enantiomeric form (e.g. (S)-BINAP) and checking whether the hydrogenated product is enantiomerically enriched in the 4R or 4S form: in the synthesis of paroxetin the enantiomeric ligand resulting in the 4R-enriched form will have to be used.<br>
The transition metal complexes with chiral diphosphinic ligands can be used as such or in a supported form e.g. onto a polymeric matrix.<br>
nydrogenation is typically carried out in alcononic and/or nalogenated solvents at 1<br>
to 150 atm and 60X to 150°C, more preferably at 5 to 15 atm and 100°C to 130°C, and most preferably at 10 atm and 120°C. Non limitative examples of the above  solvents   are  ethanol,   methanol,   n-propanol,  isopropanol,   n-butanol.<br><br>
isobutanol,   cyclohexanol,   dichloromethane,   dichloreoethane,   trichloroethane, carbon tetrachloride.<br>
According to a more specific embodiment of the present invention, it is possible to obtain the hydrogenated product (HI), substantially free from the 4S-form: by this expression it is meant that each of the (Ilia) and (Illb) isomers is present with an own enantiomeric eccess of the 4R form of at least 95%; the overall enantiomeric excess {llla)+(lllb) is also &gt; 95%. This realization is most preferred since it minimizes or substantially avoids any product loss in the form of undesired enantiomer. thus enhancing the simplicity, selectivity and economic profitability of the process. The reaction conditions are substantially those described above, i.e. from 1 to 150 atm and 60'C to 150°C, more preferably at 5 to 15 atm and 100°C to 130°C. and most preferably at 10 atm and 120°C; however in order to obtain the above mentioned enantiomeric eccess of at least 95%, the solvent is to be chosen    among:    dichloromethane,    n-propanol.        isopropanol.    isobutanol, cyclohexanol, and their mixtures, and the complex is to be selected from {RuCKp-cymene)[(S)-BINAP]}CI.    RuHCI[(S)-BINAPl2,    RU2Cl4(S)-BINAPyNEt3).    As    a further advantage, when   the hydrogenation   reaction is catalysed, by {RuCI(p-cymene)[(S)-BINAP]}Cl,  in the  presence of    isopropanol  as  a  solvent, the aforementioned substantial enantiomeric purity is associated with an extremely favourable conversion rate of product (II) to (111), [100% in 5 hrs reaction time], which element further adds significantly to the above discussed advantag'es. The compound (111) resulting from step a. is used as a cis-trans mixture (Ilia + Illb) in the next reaction (step b). Step b. requires firstly to transform the -OH group of compound (III) into a leaving group by reaction with an appropriate reagent. Preferred   reagents  for this  operation  are  tosyl  chloride,   methanesulphonyl chloride, benzenesulphonyl chloride. Said reagents are added to compound (III), at a temperature comprised between -20°C and +25°C (preferably O°C-S°C) in the presence of an inert solvent (e.g. a aromatic or aliphatic hydrocarbon, such as toluene), and of a basic compound (e.g. an organic base like triethylamine or an inorganic base or basic salt). This reaction results in an activated intermediate of formula:<br><br><br>
This product, by addition of sesamol X3,4-methylenedioxyphenol) in a basic medium, is transformed into a 4R-enantiomerically enriched compound of formula (IV). mainly in the trans form. Sesamol, as a liquid mixture with an alcoholic solvent, preferably 4-methylpentan-2-ol, is added in a 1:1 equiv. ratio referred to benzenesulphonyl chloride or methanesulphonyl chloride or tosyl chloride. The mixture is conveniently heat-refluxed preferably for a period of 2 to 4 hrs to give 4R-enantiomerically enriched frans-diastereoisomer (IV) and a minor quantity of cis diastereoisomer. which is eliminated by crystallisation.  The product (IV) is obtained mainly in the trans form, while the 4R enantiomeric enrichment previously produced is almost completely maintained, as shown by the HPLG analysis data presented In the experimental part.<br>
Step c) consists in the elimination of the alkyl group R bound to the nitrogen atom. The reaction is performed by techniques known to the art. According to a preferred embodiment, the product (IV) is mixed with phenylchloroformiate in CH2Cl2 and allowed to react for 1 to 6 hours at room temperature. At the end, the carbamic derivative of the following formula is obtained:<br><br><br>
is obtained, which is enantiomerically enriched in its 4R form (paroxetine). If<br>
present, the minor isomeric portion having 4S configuration is eliminated by<br>
crystallization. Pure paroxetine (I) is thus obtained.<br>
The compounds of formula (11) used as reagents in step a) of the process<br>
described herein may be easily obtained by various techniques known to the art.<br>
e.g.   by  allowing   1-methyl-4-fluorostyrene   to   react  with   formaldehyde   and<br>
ethylamine hydrochloride, as disclosed in WO-A-9636636.<br>
Alternatively, compounds of formula (II) may be obtained as shown in the following<br><br><br>
4-Fluorobromobenzene    and    magnesium    are    allowed    to    react   to    give<br>
4-fluorophenylmagnesium bromide (VI), to which 1-alkyl-4-piperidone is added.<br>
The resultig product is 1-a|kyl-4-(p-fluorophenyl)-4-hydroxypiperidine (VII), which<br>
is dehydrated in position 3-4 of the piperidinic ring by heat-reflux with aqueous<br>
H2SO4. to obtain 1-alkyl-4-(p-fluorophenyl)-1,2.5,6-tetrahydropyridine (VIII). This<br>
product is finally converted into the product of formula (II) by addition, in the same<br>
reaction medium, of aqueous formaldehyde (Prins's reaction).<br>
In the process of the invention, catalytic hydrogenation a) largely increases the<br>
percentage amount of enantiomers useful for paroxetine (4R) formation, and<br>
reaction b) allows the use of compound (III) in both cis and trans forms. It follows<br>
that the quantity of product to be discarded as isomerically undesired is very low<br>
and, consequently, the yield to paroxetine is high.<br>
Furthermore, an advantage of the present invention is that if avolfs 'foilowihg <br>
independent synthetic routes for cis and trans isomers, as is instead required by<br>
the aforementioned processes known to the art.<br>
Another advantage of the present invention is that the aforesaid enantiomeric<br>
excesses may be obtained at moderate pressure (5 to 15 atm): under these<br>
conditions the process may be easily scaled up to commercial size.<br>
A still further advantage of the present invention is that high enantiomeric<br>
excesses may be obtained also with low catalyst/substrate ratios, i.e. ranging from<br>
1/200 to 1/1000. The use of low quantities of catalyst favours low process<br>
investment.<br>
The following examples are shown by way of indication, not of limitation, of the<br><br>
present invention.<br>

trans, ee &gt; 69%; cis, ee &gt; 93%.<br>
CisArans ratio: 34:66; overall ee &gt; 85%.<br>
The results obtained by enantioselective hydrogenation are summarised in the<br>
following table:<br><br><br>
It can be seen that the overall ee obtained was never below 85% in all tests; in particular, for the examples C, D, E, performed with preferred ligands and solvents, both the overall ee. and the specific (Ilia)- and (lllb)-ee*s were of 98-99%.<br>
Example C was repeated with different alcoholic or halogenated solvents, in order to check the solvent effect on the enantioselectivity. The hydrogenation temperature was 120°C and the reaction was discontinued after 5 hrs. The results are summarised in the following table.<br><br>
As can be seen, all solvents afforded an ee of at least 95%. In the case of i-PrOH.<br>
in addition to an ee of 99%, a very high conversion rate (100% in 5 hrs) was<br>
observed.<br>
H) Svnthesis of 4R-c/s- and 4R-frans-4-(p-fluoroDhenvlV3-hvdroxvmethyl-1-ethyl-<br><br>
3-(3.4-methylenedioxvphenoxvmethvnpiperidine (IV) fR=Et1 A 240 ml toluenic solution of the mixture of enantiomers (Ilia) and (lllb) (40.0g 169 mmol) obtained  according to the preceding  examples was  mixed,  at room temperature and under stirring,  with triethylammine (1.7 equiv.. 286 mmol. 21.0 ml), and subsequently with a solution of methansulphonyl chloride (1.2 equiv.. 202 mmol. 15.6 ml) in toluene (40 ml) added dropwise over 1 hr. The mixture was stirred at 25°C for 3 hrs and filtered. The liquid phase was washed with water and the resulting organic phase was concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue (47.2 g) was dissolved in toluene (240 ml) and treated sequentially with a sesamol solution (1.0 equiv. in respect to the mixture of (llla).and (lllb). 169 mmol. 23.3 g) in 4-methylpentan-2-ol (100 ml) and with an aqueous solution of NaOH 10 M (1.2 equiv. in respect to the mixture of (Ula) and (lllb), 201 mmol. 20.3 ml). The resulting heterogeneous mixture was heat-refluxed for 3 hrs. The reaction mixture was then washed three times with water until neutrality and the organic phase was  separated. The  aqueous  phase was extracted   again   with   toluene.   The   organic   phases   were   combined   and concentrated at reduced pressure. GLC analysis (SE-30 capillary column) of the viscous   oil   residue   (55.0   g)   revealed   the   presence   of   cis   and   trans<br>
diastereoisomers (IV) in a 10:90 ratio. 	<br>
The residue was dissolved in isopropanol and added with gaseous HCl. Only the 4R-trans diastereoisomer (hydrochloride) precipitated in 74% yield (125 mmol; 49.1 g).<br>
The hydrochloride was then re-converted into a free base by dissolution in water, basification with 30% NaOH, and extraction of the aqueous phase with toluene. The organic phase was evaporated to give the AR-trans diastereoisomer free base (44.1 g). Yield: 99%.<br>
The enantiomeric purity of said diastereoisomer determined by HPLC (Chiradex p-cyclodextrin Merck, eluent: methanol:buffer 40:60 (1% triethylammine with pH brought to 4.1 with AcOH), flow 1 ml/min. Detector UV 290 nm) was &gt; 99%. NMR analyses carried out on AMX-600 BRUKER spectrometer including the recording of ^H and ^°C spectra, 1H-1H COSY, Heteronuclear Shift Correlation,<br><br>

MS, m/z (%): 357 (M*, 2), 220 (13), 205 (16), 137 (7), 109 (14), 98 (10), 82 (12), 72 (100). 58 (23). n Synthesis of paroxetine hydrochloride (\)<br>
A solution of 4R-frans-4-(p-fluorophenyl-3-hydroxymethyl-1-ethyl-3-(3,4-methylenedioxyphenoxymethyl)piperidine (IV) [R=Et] (26.5 g; 74.1 mmol) in dichloromethane (135 ml) was cooled to 0°C and added dropwise over 15 min with a solution of phenylchloroformiate (22.6 g; 144 mmol) dichloromethane (22 ml). The clear yellow solution was maintained at room temperature for 3 hrs, and then washed with 150 ml of NaOH 1M and two portions of 150 ml HCI 6M. The organic phase was evaporated to dryness and re-dissoived with toluene (190 ml). The resulting mixture was then filtered and added with 19.2 g (343 mmol) of solid KOH and heat-refluxed for 2 hrs." The mixture was then cooled to room temperature and added with 150 ml water. The organic phase was separated and the aqueous phase was re-extracted with two portions of 100 ml water and evaporated to dryness.<br>
The residue was dissolved in isopropanol (85 ml), and added with HCI 37%. Paroxetine hydrochloride was thus precipitated, filtered , washed and dried. 21.9 g (59.3 mmol) of paroxetin hydrochloride were thus isolated. This product, analysed by HPLC (Symmetry Shield RP8, eluent: acetonitrile:buffer 70:30 (KH2PO4 0.025 M at pH 2.5 with H3PO4), flow 1 ml/min. Detector UV 290 nm) was found to have assay 99% and purity 99.9%, with yield 80%. Spectroscopic data were in accordance with literature data.<br><br><br><br><br>
