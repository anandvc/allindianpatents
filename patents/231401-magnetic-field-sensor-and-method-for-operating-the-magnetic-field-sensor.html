				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The invention concerns a magnetic field sensor and a method for operating a magnetic field sensor.<br>
BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ART<br>
Such magnetic field sensors are suitable for the measurement of magnetic fields the strength of which<br>
amounts only to some nT (Nanotesla) to mT (Millitesla), for example as a compass for measuring the<br>
direction of the earth's magnetic field.<br>
A magnetic field sensor is known from EP 1 182 461. The magnetic field sensor is suitable for<br>
determining the direction of a two-dimensional magnetic field. The magnetic field sensor comprises a<br>
magnetic field concentrator with a flat shape and two sensors that comprise at least one Hall element,<br>
whereby the Hall elements are arranged in the area of the edge of the magnetic field concentrator. The<br>
first sensor measures a first component of the magnetic field and the second sensor measures a second<br>
component of the magnetic field. The direction of the magnetic field can therefore be determined from<br>
the signals of the two sensors.<br>
A further magnetic field sensor for determining the direction of a magnetic field is known from EP 1<br>
052 519. The magnetic field sensor comprises a ferromagnetic core in the form of a cross, an<br>
excitation coil for periodically saturating the ferromagnetic core, and read-out coils. The magnetic<br>
field sensor is operated as a flux gate sensor. The disadvantage with such a sensor is that a relatively<br>
high current is necessary for the magnetic saturation of the ferromagnetic core. Such a magnetic field<br>
sensor is therefore not suitable for applications with battery operation.<br>
A further magnetic field sensor for determining the strength of a magnetic field is known from GB<br>
2315870. The magnetic field sensor comprises a ferromagnetic core in the form of a ring, an excitation<br>
coil in order to periodically saturate the ferromagnetic core and read-out coils. Furthermore, in one<br>
design type, the sensor comprises additional ferromagnetic cores that work as external magnetic field<br>
concentrators. To reduce a possible residual magnetism of these additional cores, additional coils are<br>
present to which current is periodically applied in order to demagnetise the additional cores.<br>
SHORT DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The object of the invention is to develop a magnetic field sensor with which magnetic fields can be<br>
measured the strength of which only amounts to some nT (Nanotesla) to mT (Millitesla) even when<br>
nower is sunnlied bv a batterv without the batterv having to be freauentlv changed.<br><br>
Investigations have revealed that a significant problem exists in that the ferromagnetic core serving as<br>
magnetic field concentrator can be magnetised or the magnetisation can be reversed to such an extent<br>
by an external, for example temporarily occurring magnetic interference field, that the ferromagnetic<br>
core becomes a magnetic dipole that produces a signal in the read-out coils. Here, the invention<br>
provides a remedy in that the ferromagnetic core is brought into a state of predetermined<br>
magnetisation by applying a magnetic field at selected times, A coil is provided for producing the<br>
magnetic field. The magnetic field produced by the current flowing through the coil must be large<br>
enough that the magnetic reversal of the ferromagnetic core caused by the interference field can be<br>
cancelled. In doing so, the necessary current intensity is dependent on the magnetisation curve of the<br>
ferromagnetic core.<br>
A magnetic field sensor in accordance with the invention for the measurement of at least one<br>
component of a magnetic field comprises a ring-shaped ferromagnetic core that serves as a magnetic<br>
field concentrator, an excitation coil and a read-out sensor. The read-out sensor comprises at least one,<br>
preferably two sensors arranged in the vicinity of the outer edge of the ferromagnetic core and<br>
measures the at least one component of the magnetic field. On operation of the magnetic field sensor, a<br>
current is temporarily applied to the excitation coil at selected times in order to bring the<br>
ferromagnetic core into a state of predetermined magnetisation in which the magnetisation of the<br>
ferromagnetic core produces no signal in the read-out sensor. The current flowing through the<br>
excitation coil must be large enough so that the magnetic field produced by the current in the<br>
ferromagnetic core achieves at least the coercive field strength given by the material of the<br>
ferromagnetic core. Preferably, the current is selected so high that the magnetic field produced by it is<br>
two to three times greater than the coercive field strength. If the material has a so-called hard and a<br>
soft magnetic axis, then the greater coercive field strength of the hard magnetic axis has to be selected.<br>
With this process, the ring-shaped ferromagnetic core is magnetised for example in such a way that the<br>
field lines within the core run as closed field lines in tangential direction. This magnetisation is called<br>
circular magnetisation. By means of this predetermined magnetisation, the problem of the previously<br>
mentioned residual magnetisation that leads to errors is solved.<br>
This process of bringing the ferromagnetic core into a state of predetermined magnetisation is<br>
preferably carried out before an actual measurement of the external magnetic field. It can however be<br>
carried out periodically or at any other time. The ferromagnetic core is thus magnetised with a<br>
predetermined magnetisation and this predetermined magnetisation is refreshed or restored at specific<br>
times.<br><br>
In order to bring the ferromagnetic core into the desired state of magnetisation, a certain amount of<br>
magnetisation energy is necessary. The required magnetisation energy is, on the one hand proportional<br>
to the volume V of the ferromagnetic core and, on the other hand to the magnetic product B x H that is<br>
dependent on the hysteresis curve of the material used. In order to get the smallest possible magnetic<br>
product, a soft magnetic material, eg, Vitrovac 6025Z is selected as the material for the ferromagnetic<br>
core. The volume to be magnetised is determined by the geometry of the ferromagnetic core. Because<br>
the achievable magnetic amplification is mainly determined by the diameter of the ring-shaped<br>
ferromagnetic core, the width and thickness of the ring are selected as small as possible. For the<br>
above-mentioned material Vitrovac 6025Z, with a ring diameter of 1 mm for example, a width of 20<br>
urn and a height of l0µm are selected. The width therefore amounts to only two percent of the<br>
diameter of the ring. It makes sense when the width and height of the ring are as small as is possible as<br>
the used technology allows it. When using other technologies such as for example attaching the core to<br>
a semiconductor chip by means of electrolysis or sputtering, the thickness of the core can be reduced<br>
to one micrometer or less.<br>
A further advantage of reducing the volume of the core exists in that the build up of the<br>
premagnetisation by means of a magnetic field produced by the coil is itself less inhibited by eddy<br>
currents produced in the core. In this way, the current pulse for magnetisation can be shorter and the<br>
total required energy reduced. A sensor optimised in this way is also suitable for applications with<br>
little admissible energy consumption such as a watch for example.<br>
The magnetic field sensor can be used for example in order to measure the strength of a weak<br>
magnetic field the direction of which does not change. Such a magnetic field sensor can also be used<br>
as a current or energy sensor whereby it measures the strength of a magnetic field produced by a<br>
conductor with current flowing through it. In addition, the sensor can have a second read-out sensor in<br>
order to measure a second component of an external magnetic field. When two components of the<br>
external magnetic field are measured, then its direction can also be determined from them. Such a<br>
magnetic field sensor can therefore also be used as a compass.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ACCOMPANYING FIGURES<br>
Embodiment 1<br>
Fig. 1 shows a plan view of a magnetic field sensor formed as a semiconductor chip 1 for the<br>
measurement of two components of an external magnetic field. A Cartesian system of x, y, z co-<br>
ordinates serves as reference system the origin of which in the figure, for reasons of illustrative clarity,<br>
is arranged outside the magnetic field sensor, whereby the z direction runs vertically to the plane of<br>
projection. The magnetic field sensor comprises an electronic circuit 2, an excitation coil 3 to which<br>
current can be applied with, for example, four turns, a ring-shaped ferromagnetic core 4 and two read-<br>
out sensors 5, 6. The ferromagnetic core 4 extends in a plane and therefore defines the position of the<br>
xy plane. The read-out sensor 5 serves the acquisition of the x component of the magnetic field, the<br>
read-out sensor 6 serves the acquisition of the y component of the magnetic field. The read-out sensors<br>
5, 6 consist preferably of two locally separated but electrically connected sensors. The magnetic field<br>
sensor is manufactured using a technology with which the electronic circuit 2, parts of the excitation<br>
coil 3 and the read-out sensors 5, 6 are produced first with a standard CMOS technology and then the<br>
ferromagnetic core 4 is applied in a so-called post-process. In doing so, a tape of amorphous<br>
ferromagnetic material is adhered to the wafer with the semiconductor circuits and structured by<br>
means of photolithography and chemical etching. After sawing the wafer into the individual<br>
semiconductor chips, the turns of the excitation coil 3 are completed on mounting the semiconductor<br>
chip onto a substrate either by wire bonding (as shown) or by means of the flip-chip technology. The<br>
electronic circuit 2 serves to produce the current flowing through the excitation coil 3 and to evaluate<br>
the signals delivered by the read-out sensors 5, 6.<br>
With the embodiment shown in Fig. 1, the excitation coil 3 has four turns that consist partially of<br>
conductor paths 7 and partially of bond wires 8. The conductor paths 7 run underneath and the bond<br>
wires 8 run above the ferromagnetic core 4. The bond wires 8 connect one end of a conductor path 7 to<br><br>
one end of another conductor path 7. A circuit 9 serves to temporarily apply a current I(t) to the<br>
excitation coil 3 in order to bring the ferromagnetic core 4 into a state of predetermined magnetisation.<br>
The variable t designates the time.<br>
The electronic circuit 2 is supplied with energy by a not presented energy source, in particular a<br>
battery. The electronic circuit 2 serves to operate the circuit 9, the read-out sensors 5, 6 and the<br>
evaluation of the signals delivered by the read-out sensors 5, 6.<br><br>
The tape made of amorphous metal available under the designation VAC 6025Z serves for example as<br>
material for the ferromagnetic core 4. This material has a coercive field strength of Hc = 3 mA/cm. In<br>
order to magnetically saturate the ferromagnetic core 4, the current I flowing through the excitation<br>
coil 3 should produce a magnetic field Hs that is around 20 times greater than the coercive field<br>
strength Hc. When the outer diameter D of the ring-shaped ferromagnetic core 4 is D = 1 mm and the<br>
number n of the tuns of the excitation coil 3 amounts to n = 4, then, according to the equation<br>
I = 20*Hc*D*7π/n	(1)<br>
one gets 1 = 4.5 mA for the current. Because the ferromagnetic core 4 has no air gap it can be<br>
magnetically saturated by means of a small magnetic field and therefore by means of a low current I.<br>
As read-out sensors 5 and 6, the magnetic field sensor preferably has four so-called horizontal Hall<br>
elements 10, 11, 12 and 13 coupled in pairs that are sensitive to a magnetic field that runs vertically to<br>
the surface of the semiconductor chip 1, ie, that runs in z direction. The Hall elements 10 and 12 are<br>
arranged on the x-axis of the Cartesian system of co-ordinates and form the first read-out sensor 5. The<br>
Hall elements 10 and 12 are therefore arranged at diametrically opposite locations in relation to a<br>
symmetrical axis running through the centre of the ferromagnetic core 4. The Hall elements 11 and 13<br>
are arranged on the y-axis of the Cartesian system of co-ordinates and form the second read-out sensor<br>
6. The horizontal Hall elements 10 to 13 are always arranged underneath the ferromagnetic core 4 in<br>
the vicinity of its outer edge. Because the relative permeability µr of the ferromagnetic core 4 is very<br>
large in relation to the relative permeability of its surroundings, the field lines of the external magnetic<br>
field to be measured impinge almost orthogonally on the surface of the ferromagnetic core 4 or leave it<br>
at almost a orthogonal angle. The field concentration is greatest in the area of the outer edge of the<br>
ferromagnetic core 4 where the Hall elements 10 to 13 are located. The output signals of the two Hall<br>
elements 10 and 12 are dependent on the strength of the x component of the external magnetic field,<br>
the output signals of the two Hall elements 11 and 13 are dependent on the strength of the y<br>
component of the external magnetic field.<br><br>
Fig. 2 shows the field lines 14 of the external magnetic field when the ferromagnetic core 4 is not<br>
saturated by the magnetic field produced by the current flowing through the excitation coil 3 (Fig. 1).<br>
The field lines at the locations of the two Hall elements 10 and 12 point in different directions because<br>
the magnetic field enters the ferromagnetic core 4 at the location of one of the Hall elements, for<br>
example Hall element 10, and leaves it again at the location of the other Hall element 12. The two Hall<br>
elements 10 and 12 are electrically interconnected as read-out sensor 5 (Fig. 1) in such a way that the<br>
Hall voltages produced by the x component of the external magnetic field in the Hall elements 10 and<br>
12 are added. However, any z component of the external magnetic field present at the two Hall<br>
elements 10 and 12 points in the same z direction and therefore causes no output signal in the read-out<br>
sensor 5.<br>
It is advantageous not to permanently electrically interconnect the two Hall elements 10 and 12 as<br>
read-out sensor 5 but in such a way that the output signals of the two Hall elements 10 and 12 are<br>
alternatively added or subtracted. In this way either the x component or the z component of the<br>
external magnetic field can be measured with the read-out sensor 5 corresponding to the momentary<br>
electrical interconnection of the two Hall elements 10 and 12. For measurement of the z component of<br>
the magnetic field a separate Hall element can however also be provided that is not located in the<br>
vicinity of the edge of the ferromagnetic core 4 so that neither the x component nor the y component<br>
of the magnetic field contribute to its Hall voltage.<br>
Each of the read-out sensors 5 and 6 can however also comprise of only one Hall element, the read-out<br>
sensor 5 for example of Hall element 10 and the read-out sensor 6 of Hall element 11 when the z<br>
component of the magnetic field is negligibly small in relation to the x and y components of the<br>
magnetic field amplified by the ferromagnetic core 4. In this case, for measurement of the z<br>
component of the magnetic field a separate Hall element is to be provided that is not located in the<br>
vicinity of the edge of the ferromagnetic core 4.<br>
The excitation coil 3 (Fig. 1) serves to bring the ferromagnetic core 4 into a state of predetermined<br>
magnetisation at specific times. Here it is basically a case of magnetising the ferromagnetic core 4 in<br>
such a way that its magnetisation produces no signal in the read-out sensors 5, 6. Coincidental<br>
magnetisation of the ferromagnetic core 4 caused by external influence that produces an undesired<br>
signal in the read-out sensors 5, 6 is thereby neutralised.<br>
The ferromagnetic core 4 is magnetised in such a way that the magnetic field produced by its<br>
magnetisation produces no signal in the read-out sensors 5, 6. This means that any components of this<br><br>
magnetic field run either orthogonally to the sensitivity direction of the Hall elements 10 to 13 or they<br>
run in the Hall elements 10, 11, 12 and 13 connected in pairs as read-out sensors 5, 6 in the same z<br>
direction so that the Hall voltages produced by them are compensated.<br>
In the following, further measures are now described the application of which lead to increased<br>
sensitivity of the magnetic field sensor and/or to lower current or energy consumption.<br>
When the number of turns of the excitation coil 3 is increased to n, then either the current flowing<br>
through the excitation coil 3 can be reduced by the factor n or the diameter D of the ring-shaped<br>
ferromagnetic core 4 can be increased by the factor n and, in accordance with the equation (1), on<br>
magnetisation one gets the same degree of saturation of the ferromagnetic core 4. An increase in the<br>
diameter D of the ferromagnetic core 4 causes an amplification of the flow concentration but increases<br>
the space requirement and therefore the dimensions of the semiconductor chip 1. With a view to the<br>
aim of the greatest possible miniaturisation of the magnetic field sensor, optimum conditions then<br>
result when the diameter D of the ferromagnetic core 4 is adapted to the dimensions of the<br>
semiconductor chip 1 as are given by the space requirements for the electronic circuit 2 and the<br>
number n of turns of the excitation coil 3 is adapted to the size of the ferromagnetic core 4.<br>
Embodiment 2<br>
Fig. 3 shows a plan view of a further magnetic field sensor with a ring-shaped ferromagnetic core 4<br>
with which the excitation coil 3 is formed as a flat coil 15 with a spiral conductor path 16 that is<br>
arranged underneath the ferromagnetic core 4. The conductor path 16 runs spirally but nevertheless<br>
almost concentrically to the ferromagnetic core 4.<br>
A first end 17 of the conductor path 16 is naturally located within, a second end 18 of the conductor<br>
path 16 outside the ring-shaped ferromagnetic core 4. A conductor path 19 arranged in a second<br>
metallisation layer connects the first end 17 with a connection 20 arranged outside the ring-shaped<br>
ferromagnetic core 4. (The bond wire 8 also illustrated is not present for the second embodiment but is<br>
important for the third embodiment.) The conductor path 19 is therefore located on the same side of<br>
the ferromagnetic core 4 as the flat coil 15. Although the conductor path 16 of the flat coil 15 runs<br>
spirally, parts of the conductor path 16 running in radial direction do not contribute to the magnetic<br>
field produced by the flat coil 15 as the current flowing in the conductor path 19 flows in the opposite<br>
direction to the current flowing in radial direction through the flat coil 15 and therefore compensates it.<br>
The magnetic field produced by the flat coil 15 therefore corresponds to a magnetic field produced by<br>
concentrically arranged conductor paths.<br><br>
Embodiment 3<br>
This example largely corresponds to the second embodiment but instead of the conductor path 19, the<br>
bond wire 8 is present that connects the first end 17 of the flat coil 15 with a connection 20 arranged<br>
outside the ring-shaped ferromagnetic core 4. Because the flat coil 15 and the bond wire 8 cross the<br>
ferromagnetic core 4 on different sides, namely the flat coil 15 underneath and the bond wire 8 above,<br>
the result is a supplementary coil with one single winding that encloses the ring of the ferromagnetic<br>
core 4 and works as an excitation coil in accordance with the first embodiment. In contrast to the<br>
second embodiment, the current flowing through the bond wire 8 does not compensate the current<br>
flowing in radial direction through the flat coil 15. The combination of flat coil 15 and bond wire 8<br>
represents an excitation coil 3 with which the ferromagnetic core 4 can be brought into a state of<br>
predetermined magnetisation in a very efficient way in which the magnetisation of the core 4 produces<br>
no signal in the read-out sensors 5, 6.<br>
In the following at least one first method is described for the three embodiments in order to bring the<br>
ferromagnetic core 4 into a state of predetermined, non-vanishing magnetisation. The methods are<br>
preferably carried out before a measurement of the x and y components of the external magnetic field<br>
is carried out with the magnetic field sensor unless the magnetic field that is produced temporarily by<br>
the current flowing through the excitation coil 3 while carrying out the methods produces no signal in<br>
the read-out sensors 5, 6.<br>
The following methods 1.1 and 1.2 relate to the first embodiment and their effects are described for the<br>
first embodiment whereby the terms and references relate to the figures assigned to the first<br>
embodiment.<br>
Method 1.1<br>
With this first method, a current I(t) is applied to the excitation coil 3 for a predetermined time<br>
duration in order to uniformly magnetise the ferromagnetic core 4. The magnetic field B(t) produced<br>
by the current I(t) flowing through the excitation coil 3 runs along concentric, closed lines in the<br>
ferromagnetic core 4. This magnetic field is designated as a circular magnetic field. The current I(t) is<br>
for example a direct current pulse the strength of which first increases and is then reduced to zero. In<br>
order that a magnetisation caused through outer influences can be completely neutralised, the direct<br>
current I(t) is preferably increased until the ferromagnetic core 4 is magnetically saturated or is almost<br>
magnetically saturated and then reduced again to zero. The maximum of the direct current I(t)<br>
produces a magnetic field in the ferromagnetic core 4 the magnetic field strength of which is greater,<br>
preferably twice or three times greater, than the coercive field strength Hc of the material of the<br><br>
ferromagnetic core 4. The maximum of the direct current I(t) should be selected so high that a<br>
magnetic reversal of the ferromagnetic core 4 caused by an interference field can be neutralised. In<br>
doing so, the necessary current strength is dependent on the magnetisation curve of the ferromagnetic<br>
core 4. In this way, the ferromagnetic core 4 is magnetised whereby its magnetisation corresponds<br>
roughly to the remanence of the ferromagnetic material. The ring-shaped structure of the<br>
ferromagnetic core 4 of the first embodiment offers the advantage that the field lines of the magnetic<br>
field produced by its magnetisation close inside the ferromagnetic core 4. The magnetic field produced<br>
by the magnetisation outside the ferromagnetic core 4 runs orthogonally to the sensitivity direction of<br>
the Hall elements 10-13 and therefore produces no Hall voltage.<br>
Fig. 4A shows with broken lines the course of the field lines after the ring-shaped core 4 has been<br>
magnetised by an outer magnetic interference field. Arrows indicate the direction of the field. The<br>
ring-shaped core works as a magnetic dipole and produces an undesired signal in the read-out sensors<br>
5 and 6. Fig. 4B shows the course of the field lines after the ring-shaped core 4 has been magnetically<br>
reversed by means of the previously described method. The field lines now run closed within the core<br>
4. The strength of the magnetisation corresponds typically to the remanence of the material of the core<br>
4.<br>
This first method can be carried out before each measurement of the external magnetic field or only<br>
occasionally.<br>
Method 2.1<br>
This second method is carried out for each measurement of the external magnetic field. A<br>
measurement consists of two individual measurements. The measurement takes place in accordance<br>
with the following steps:<br>
a)	A direct current pulse I(t) is applied to the excitation coil 3 whereby the current flows through the<br>
excitation coil 3 in a first direction.<br>
b)	The output signals are read out from the read-out sensors 5 and 6.<br>
c)	A direct current pulse I(t) is applied to the excitation coil 3 whereby the current flows through the<br>
excitation coil 3 in the direction opposite to the first direction.<br>
d)	The output signals are read out from the read-out sensors 5 and 6.<br>
e)	The output signals read out from the read-out sensor 5 in steps b and d are added and the measured<br>
output signals of the read-out sensor 6 are added.<br><br>
With this method, the influence of any magnetic dispersion occurring locally in the area of the Hall<br>
elements 10 to 13 that is caused by non-homogeneity of the material of the ferromagnetic core 4 can<br>
be reduced as the magnetic dispersion with the first individual measurement forms a positive<br>
contribution to the output signals and with the second individual measurement a negative contribution<br>
to the output signals that cancel each other out on the summation in step e.<br>
The methods 1.2 and 2.2 relate to the second embodiment and their effects are described for the<br>
second embodiment whereby the terms and references relate to the figures assigned to the second<br>
embodiment.<br>
Method 1.2<br>
With this method, a direct current I(t) is applied to the excitation coil 3 for a predetermined time<br>
duration. The direct current I(t) flowing in the flat coil 15 causes a magnetisation of the ferromagnetic<br>
core 4 in radial direction. The course of the field lines of the magnetisation is represented with arrows<br>
21 in Fig. 5 that presents a section in the z plane. With the flat coil 15, the ferromagnetic core 4 can be<br>
magnetised in an efficient way. With this magnetisation, the field lines do not close within the<br>
ferromagnetic core 4. The radial magnetisation produces a non-vanishing magnetic field outside the<br>
ferromagnetic core 4, This magnetic field is however symmetrical to the axis of symmetry of the<br>
ferromagnetic core 4. The field lines of this magnetic field run in the same direction for all Hall<br>
elements 10-13 and therefore produce the same Hall voltage in all Hall elements 10 - 13. Because the<br>
read-out sensors 5, 6 each consist of 2 oppositely coupled Hall elements, these Hall voltages make no<br>
contribution to the output signals of the read-out sensors 5, 6.<br>
Method 2.2<br>
With this method, an alternating current is applied to the excitation coil 3. The flat coil 15 and the<br>
electrically conductive ferromagnetic core 4 work as a transformer whereby the flat coil 15 forms the<br>
primary winding with N turns and the transformer the secondary winding with one single turn. With<br>
ideal coupling therefore, the alternating current induced in the ferromagnetic core 4 is N times greater<br>
than the alternating current flowing through the flat coil 15. The alternating current induced in the<br>
ferromagnetic core 4 causes an alternating magnetisation of the core 4 the field lines of which take the<br>
course of those presented in Fig. 6. These field lines close within the ferromagnetic core 4.<br>
The methods 1.3 and 2.3 relate to the third embodiment and their effects are described for the third<br>
embodiment whereby the terms and references relate to the figures assigned to the third embodiment.<br>
The current flowing through the additional coil produces a circular magnetic field in the ferromagnetic<br><br>
core 4 that is superimposed on the magnetic field formed by the flat coil 15. The resulting effect is<br>
dependent on whether a direct current or an alternating current is applied to the excitation coil 3<br>
formed by the flat coil 15 and the bond wire 8.<br>
Method 1.3<br>
A direct current is applied to the excitation coil 3 (as with methods 1.1 and 2.1). Thanks to the flat coil<br>
15, the ferromagnetic core 4 is magnetised in an efficient way as with the method 1.2 for the second<br>
embodiment. The additional coil additionally causes a circular magnetic field in the ferromagnetic<br>
core 4 as with the first embodiment. The resulting magnetisation of the ferromagnetic core 4 is now no<br>
longer radial but has an additional tangential component. This state of magnetisation is shown in Fig.<br>
7. Fig. 7 shows a plan view of the ferromagnetic core 4. The local direction of the magnetisation is<br>
represented by arrows 21. When the direct current is switched off, then the magnetisation in the<br>
individual magnetic domains of the ferromagnetic core 4 turns in tangential direction so that the<br>
magnetic field lines close. On switching off the direct current, a circular magnetisation of the<br>
ferromagnetic core 4 is therefore automatically set that, as already mentioned earlier, has the<br>
advantage that its magnetic field produces no signal in the read-out sensors 5, 6.<br>
For the additional coil, instead of the single winding realised by the bond wire 8, several windings can<br>
be provided that, as with the first embodiment, are realised for example by conductor paths and bond<br>
wires. The number of windings of the flat coil 15 and the number of windings of the additional coil are<br>
to be adapted to one another so that the circular magnetisation can be achieved with a minimum of<br>
energy.<br>
Method 2.3<br>
When an alternating current with constant amplitude is applied to the excitation coil 3, then the<br>
magnetic domains within the ferromagnetic core 4 have helical alignment. If the alternating current is<br>
switched off then the magnetic domains turn automatically so that the field lines of the magnetic field<br>
produced by them can close. In this way, a circular magnetisation of the ferromagnetic core 4 can be<br>
achieved as with the method 1.3.<br>
With the described embodiments horizontal Hall elements 10 - 13 are used as sensors for measuring<br>
the external magnetic field. However, instead of the horizontal Hall elements 10 - 13 it is also possible<br>
to use so-called vertical Hall elements that are sensitive to a magnetic field that runs parallel to the<br>
surface. From Fig. 2 it follows that, instead of on the outer edge underneath the ferromagnetic core 4,<br>
the vertical Hall elements have to be arranged somewhat outside the ferromagnetic core 4 where the<br><br>
field lines run almost horizontally. Furthermore, instead of the Hall elements, magneto-resistive<br>
sensors or magneto-transistors can also be used. However it must then be checked whether the<br>
magnetisation produced in the ferromagnetic core 4 has the same influence on such a sensor as on a<br>
horizontal Hall element.<br><br>
