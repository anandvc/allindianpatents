				<td>Separation of Equipment Fragmens From A Food Processing Line<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention concerns moulding compositions and articles when moulded from the compositions inter alia for the food industrv and a method of removing physical contamination from food.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention will be described in its application to the food industrv, but those skilled<br>
in the art will appreciate its applicability to other fields such as pharmaceuticals and mining. The food industry already screens its processes for physical contamination. Metallic parts such as nuts or rivets are easy to remove because metal detectors signal their presence. Plastic parts such as mixer blades, or rubber parts such as 0-rings sometimes fail and these may produce fragments ofdifferent sizes. This problem is dealt withinUS 6,113,482 and US 6,177,113. Incorporation of stainless steel particles in the machinery components which are susceptible to breakage ensures that the fragments elect a signal from a metal detector in the conveyor on which ali products must pass. The detectors which routinely screen the product are runed to find specific sizes and are calibrated with l mm diameter test bališ. It is unrealistic to rely on these to detect smaller metal contaminants.<br>
In confectionery making by factory processes, a special problem arises. It is known in to čast jelly confections in cavities pressed into powders such as starch. The starch is laid as a bed in shallovv trays which pass through a low temperature oven. After the trays of jelly confections have passed through the oven they are inverted over a sieve for reuse. The inversion and other tray handling operarions are performed mechanically, and inevitably a percentage of trays break and fragments contaminate the food. The trays are commonly made of plywood, which dries out with repeated passages through the oven, and if the tray shatters the contamination may affect more than one tray of food. Such failures are a problem and much wholesome food must be discarded to ensure that the result of the failure has been eliminated from the food Une and the starch Une. The starch in the starch line is recycled continuously and it is imperative to ensure that contaminants are not recycled at the same time. The aim is therefore to remove contaminants before thev become embedded in food because then they become more difficult to remove.<br>
A change to thermoset plastic trays which are stronger than plywood has not removed the danger but has exchanged one type of contamination for another. Such thermosetting resins are referred to as sheet moulding compositions (SMC).<br>
SUMMARV OF THE INVENTION<br>
A method aspect of the invention provides a method of detection and removal of<br>
contamination due to the failure in use of trays used in the manufacturing process of material intended for human consumption.<br>
The trays upon failure break into fragments releasing chips or particles that contaminate the confections and the starch. The contamination can then be removed by a suitable magnetic field (permanent or electromagnet) and where this is not practicable the contamination can be detected (by a metal detector) and physically removed.<br>
The composition aspect of the invention provides amouldingmix for thetrays described above comprising a moulding polymer which includes a filler that renders the item susceptible to a magnetic field.<br>
Preferably the filler is present in a quantity sufficient to make possible the capture or detection of the fragments of the item in the event of breakage.<br>
Thermosets which are already in use are suitable except to say that the prior art mixes do not contain the magnetic ingredient. The mix may also contain one or more fillers, for example mineral fillers having no magnetisable property. These would also be present in somewhat less propoitions than is found in commercial mixers because the magnetic component acts as a filler also. The magnetic component may be selected from a group of magnetisable metals, their alloys and their oxides. These are described in the literature. The composition content may comprise magnetic filler 5-30%, resin 15-35%, chopped strand fibreglass 15-35%, and other fillers and additives.<br>
Thus enabling the removal of moulding polymer fragments down to very fine dust that is not othervvise possible \vith metal detection equipment.<br>
In addition, by loading the moulding polymer with up to 50% by wt of magnetic filler in the event that by some means a chip of the moulding polymer mixed with magnetic filler is embedded in a solid piece of food, or packaged into a bag prior to sale, sisnificantly smaller pieces can be detected than would othenvise be possible.<br>
The apparatus aspect of the invention provides a tray or carrier for ingredients used inter<br>
alia in the food industry made from a moulding mix as described above.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
Figure l is a simplified block diagram of the fabrication process for forming a moulding from a plastic material containing the magnetic filler.<br>
Figure 2 is a cross section of a fragment of a starch moulding tray.<br>
Figure 3 is a simplified block diagram representing a food processing line that rnay utilise a plastic material containing the magnetic filler.<br>
Figure 4 is a diagrammatic perspective of a confectionery manufacturing process which utilises starch mogul technology.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION WITH RESPECT TO THE DRAWINGS<br>
In Figure l, the liquid polymer resin is compounded with the particulate fillers and moulded between the heated platens of a compression die. The proportions indicated below suit thermosetting resins also and these require curing periods of about 5 minutes at 150°C. A commercial formulation can be modified by the supplier, such as ASTAR S.A., who may substitute a requested filler for a standard filler, eg. magnetisable filler. As a percentage of the composition 10-50% is magnetisable, whereas the remaining ingredients including polymer are from 20-30%. If glass fibre is unsuitable, it is preferable to substitute an organic vegetable fibre.<br>
Starch trays for confectionery making are moulded rom compositions made to the follovving formulation:-<br>
Example l<br><br>
o<br>
Polyester resin	25%<br>
Chopped strand glass	25%<br><br>
Magnetic filler	10%<br>
Other fillers and additives	40%<br>
Example 2<br>
Polyester resin	34%<br>
Jute fibres	26%<br>
Magnetic filler (magnetite)	17%<br>
Other fillers and additives	23%<br>
Both tvpes of filler are mixed with the resin. The jute fibres are laid up as a mat 6mm thick and immersed in the resin/filler mix. Excess is drained and the soaked mat is laid in the die cavity with the edges of the mat brought to the die edges. The die is closed and cured for 5 minutes at 150°C. The resulting tray weighs 3.5kg and measures 800 x 400mm.<br>
m a variant, the shedding of fibres as a result of breakage is suppressed by placing on top of the wet mat a layer of woven fabric which has also been soaked in the same polymer/filler mix.<br>
If thermoplastic trays are required, injection moulding is used instead with no reinforcement, only fillers are incorporated into the injected material.<br>
Example 3<br>
Tale filled polypropylene resin         84%<br>
Magnetic filler	16%<br>
Trays moulded from this composition are much less brittle than trays made from thermosetting resin and tend not to chip. Accordingly, the fragments are larger and are<br>
completely collected by an electromagnet.<br>
Wlule strength is improved, shrinkage and distortion are reduced by the addition of a<br><br>
small quantity of glass fibre.<br>
Example 4<br>
Tale filled pp	74%<br>
Magnetite	16%<br>
Glass fibre	10%<br>
Magnetite is mined, ground and dried similar to tale, calcium carbonate and other minerals used in the plastics industry as fillers. It is available as a very fine powder with a mean particle siže of 20 microns or finer and has a specific gravity range of about 5.0. Other particles may be used which also have a strong attraction to magnets, these include magnetisable metals, their alloys, their oxides and ferrites. The type of magnetic filler used is dependant on the application, consideration of cost and processing considerations.<br>
Refening now to Figure 2, the tray 2 is approximately 800 x 350 x 30mm and is moulded in a compression die and cured beUveen a pair of heated platens (not shovra).<br>
Figure 3 is a generic block diagram representation of a food processing Une, including food processing equipment, having one or more plastic components manufactured firom a plastic material with a magnetic filler as shown in Figure l. A foodstuff and associated carriers is carried by the equipment. During this process, a breakage may occur resulting in the contamination of the foodstuff or carriers in contact with the foodstuff. The foodstuff or carriers in contact \vith the foodstuff is then passed through magnetic separation equipment.<br>
Referring now to Figure 4, in a confectionery factory, the trays 2 are filled with powdered starch 4 and multiple cavities 6 are pressed into the compacted starch. Jelly items 8 are deposited in the cavities in a known manner. After baking, the trays emerge on conveyer 10 and travci to the transfer station 12 vvhere a mechanical tipper inverts the tray and replaces it on conveyor 10. It is at this station 12 that the trays may break. The jelly items and starch fali onto a suitable screen 14 that separates the starch from the jellies. The starch collects onto conveyor 16 any chips of tray material \vhich pass along the<br><br>
conveyor 16 with the starch reach magnetic separator 17 which removes them.<br>
The jelly items transferred along conveyor 15 are advanced towards gate 18. This has a horizontal slot 20 which allows the jelly items to pass, but if the tray shatters, the fragments are directed to bin 22. Any chips of tray material which pass along the conveyor with the product reach the magnetic separator 24 which removes more of the tray. Any additional chips of tray that may be adhered to the jellies can be detected by a magnetic field (metal detector) 26 and the jelly and contarninaticn physically separated by rejecting the packet containing the offending jelly.<br>
The dumped starch travels to the reuse area via conveyor 28. Contaminating chips are removed by magnet 30.<br>
I have found the advantages of the above embodiment to be:-<br>
1.	Reduces customer complaints about unexpected inclusions in the product.<br>
2.	Reduces litigious claims in respect of product contamination.<br>
3.	Static electricity controls need to be considered for the transfer of dry starch since<br>
finely divided dusts in air present an explosive hazard. By the addition of an<br>
additive to make the trays dissipate static, the risks to plant and personnel are<br>
reduced.<br>
It is to be understood that the word "comprising" as used throughout the specification is to be interpreted in its inclusive form, ie. use of the word "comprising" does not exclude the addition of otlier elements.<br>
It is to be understood that various modifications of and/or additions to the invention can be made without departing from the basic nature of the invention. These modifications and/or additions are therefore considered to fali vvithin the scope of the invention.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
