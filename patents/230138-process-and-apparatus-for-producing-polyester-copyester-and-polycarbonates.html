				<td>Process and Apparatus for Producing Polyesters, Copolyesters and Polycarbonates<br>
Description<br>
This invention relates to a process and an apparatus for producing polyesters, copolyesters<br>
and polycarbonates by esterification of dicarboxylic acids or dicarboxylic acid esters and<br>
diols or by transesterification of dialkyl carbonates or diaryl carbonates with bisphenols in<br>
at least one reaction stage, prepolycondensation of the esterification or transesterification<br>
product in at least one reaction stage, and polycondensation of the prepolycondensation<br>
product in at least one reaction stage.<br>
For the continuous production of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and the copolyesters<br>
thereof, terephthalic acid (PTA) or dimethyl terephthalate (DMT) and ethylene glycol (EG)<br>
as well as possibly further comonoraers are used as starting substances PTA is mixed with<br>
EG and a catalyst solution to form a paste and is charged to a first reaction stage for<br>
esterification, in which reaction stage esterification is effected at atmospheric or<br>
superatmospheric pressure by removing water. When DMT is used, the DMT melt and the<br>
catalyst together with the EG are supplied to a first reaction stage for transesterification, in<br>
which reaction stage the reaction is performed at atmospheric pressure by removing<br>
methanol (MeOH). The substances removed, together with distilled EG, are supplied to a<br>
rectification column for recovering EG.<br>
The EG recovered is again used for esterification or for producing the paste. The product<br>
stream of the esterification/transesterification is supplied to a reaction stage for<br>
prepolycondensation, which in general is performed in a vacuum. The product stream of<br><br>
the prepolycondensation is introduced into a reaction stage for polycondensation. The<br>
polyester melt obtained is processed directly to obtain fibers or chips. In the process of<br>
producing PET, esterification is effected in two reaction stages which constitute stirred<br>
tanks. With plant capacities up to 400 t/day, prepolycondensation is performed in a vertical<br>
cascade reactor with bottom stirrer, and with plant capacities up to 900 t/day in two<br>
polycondensation stages of a first reaction stage constituting a stirred tank and in a<br>
succeeding horizontal cascade reactor. For polycondensation, there is likewise used a<br>
horizontal cascade reactor. These horizontal cascade reactors include chambers at the<br>
bottom and a stirrer equipped with vertical perforated disks or ring disks on a horizontal<br>
shaft for the purpose of producing a defined surface.<br>
The plant comprising two esterification stages, two prepolycondensation stages and one<br>
polycondensation stage, of which the first three reaction stages constitute stirred tanks and<br>
the last two reaction stages constitute horizontal cascade reactors, provides for a high<br>
stability and flexibility of the PET production and in addition offers the best opportunities<br>
for increasing the plant capacity, which involves, however, a considerable increase in the<br>
expenses for equipment and building (Schumann, Heinz-Dieter: Polyester producing<br>
plants: principles and technology. Landsberg/Lech: Verlag Moderne Industrie, 1996, pp.<br>
27 to 33).<br>
In a plant comprising two stirred tanks for esterification, one story-type reactor for<br>
prepolycondensation and one horizontal cascade reactor for polycondensation, a<br>
comparable stability and flexibility of the polyester production is obtained with relatively<br>
reduced effort, but it is disadvantageous that the dimensions of the reactors of the<br>
prepolycondensation and polycondensation stages are increased because of increased vapor<br>
volumes, and the admissible transport dimensions are already achieved with mean plant<br>
capacities.<br>
Proceeding from the prior art described above, it is the object of the present invention to<br>
provide a process and an apparatus for performing the process, which provide for a<br>
substantial increase of the capacities of the plants for producing PET, which are formed of<br>
four reaction stages, and alternatively a transfer of large plants comprising five reaction<br>
stages to four reaction stages without increasing the vapor load and/or the increased risk of<br>
the entrainment of product by the vapors during the prepolycondensation or<br>
polycondensation. Furthermore, in the production of polybutylene terephthalate (PBT)<br><br>
from PTA and 1,4-butanediol (BDO), a critical vapor load should already be avoided in the<br>
esterification stage operated in a vacuum.<br>
The solution of this object consists in that in at least one of the reaction stages the product<br>
stream supplied is divided in at least two partial streams before or inside the reaction stage,<br>
and the partial streams are passed through the reaction stage wholly or partly separate from<br>
each other.<br>
In accordance with the further aspect of the invention, the partial streams, preferably in<br>
equal amounts, are passed through the reaction stage so as to converge up to a common<br>
product outlet, or are supplied in the direction of a common product outlet parallel to each<br>
other in portions of the reaction stage, wherein the partial streams in the reaction stage are<br>
combined when reaching the outlet at the latest and the amount of product streams<br>
introduced into and discharged from the reaction stages is controlled.<br>
An inventive alternative consists in that in the reaction stage for the prepolycondensation<br>
or polycondensation, the partial streams are supplied to separate outlets so as to diverge in<br>
opposite directions.<br>
For performing the process, a cascade reactor or cage reactor is provided in accordance<br>
with the embodiment of the invention, which reactor has at least two physically separate<br>
portions divided in partial spaces to be flown through separately one after the other.<br>
As horizontal cascade reactor there is preferably used a stirred reactor with perforated or<br>
ring disks.<br>
In the case of converging partial streams, the inlet for the partial streams is each provided<br>
at the end faces, and the outlet for the product stream formed of the partial streams is<br>
provided in the middle region of the stirred reactor.<br>
In the case of a product line branching or a product differentiation by different viscosities it<br>
is also expedient to provide the inlet for the product stream supplied for forming the partial<br>
streams in the middle region and accordingly the outlet of the partial streams at each of the<br>
ends of the stirred reactor.<br><br>
Instead of a stirred reactor, the use of a vertical story-type reactor is also possible, in which<br>
the inlets for the product stream are disposed in the top region and the outlet for the<br>
product stream of the combined partial streams is disposed in the bottom, and at least in the<br>
upper portion there are provided stories connected in parallel for separately guiding the<br>
partial streams and a succeeding story or a bottom space for combining the partial streams.<br>
A story-type reactor can be used such that inlet and outlet are connected via a product<br>
recirculation line disposed outside the story-type reactor, in which recirculation line an<br>
inlet for the product, a heating for the product and elements for dividing the product stream<br>
in partial streams are integrated.<br>
In the drawing, several embodiments are represented in the form of process flow diagrams,<br>
which will be described in detail below.<br>
Fig. 1 shows a plant comprising four reaction stages for producing PET, in which a paste-<br>
like mixture of PTA and EG together with catalyst solution is continuously supplied via<br>
line (1) to the first reaction stage (2) constituting a stirred reactor, in which a temperature<br>
of 260°C and a pressure of 1600 mbar (abs) exist. Via line (3), the product stream<br>
discharged from the first reaction stage (2) is charged to the second reaction stage (4),<br>
which constitutes a stirred reactor and has a temperature of 263 °C and a pressure of 1080<br>
mbar (abs). Via lines (5, 6), the vapors formed during esterification are discharged to a<br>
rectification column not shown here and decomposed in the same to form water and EG.<br>
The EG obtained is directly recirculated to the reaction stages (2, 4) and/or again used for<br>
producing the paste-like mixture The product stream having a degree of esterification of<br>
97 % is discharged from the reaction stage (4) via line (7) and divided in two partial<br>
product streams of equal amounts, which for the purpose of prepolycondensation are<br>
introduced via lines (8, 9) into two identical input stories (10, 11) of a vertical story-type<br>
reactor (12) with stirred bottom space (13) at a pressure of 15 mbar (abs), flow over<br>
succeeding stories (14, 15) to the bottom space (13) and are again combined in the same.<br>
Via line (16), the product stream flowing out of the story-type reactor (12) is charged to the<br>
front of a stirred reactor (17) with ring disks for polycondensation, and the finished<br>
polymer is discharged at the back thereof via line (18). Via line (19) of the story-type<br>
reactor (12) and via line (20) of the stirred reactor (17), the respectively required operating<br>
vacuum is applied. To avoid the entrainment of droplets, the stories (10, 11, 14, 15) of the<br>
story-type reactor (12) may be divided in chambers and be provided with droplet<br><br>
separators. With the plant concept described above, critical vapor loads can be avoided<br>
even with high flow rates.<br>
Another aspect of the process of the invention is shown in Fig. 2. For esterification, the<br>
paste-like mixture consisting of PTA and EG together with catalyst solution is supplied via<br>
line (21) to the first reaction stage (22) constituting a stirred tank, and via line (23) the<br>
reaction product is supplied to the second reaction stage (24) comprising a stirred tank, in<br>
which there is integrated a partial vacuum stage (25) with a pressure of 550 mbar (abs).<br>
Via lines (26, 27, 28), the vapors obtained during esterification are supplied to a<br>
rectification column not shown here and separated into water and EG, wherein the vapors<br>
flowing out of the partial vacuum stage (25) at a temperature of 267°C are condensed by<br>
means of a gas jet pump (29), which is operated with the vapors of the first reaction stage<br>
(22) as motive steam. The product stream withdrawn from the partial vacuum stage (25)<br>
via line (30) is divided in two partial product streams of equal amounts, of which the one<br>
partial product stream is charged to the front of a stirred reactor (33) with perforated disks<br>
via line (31), and the other partial product stream is charged to the back of said reactor via<br>
line (32) for the purpose of prepolycondensation, the partial streams flowing axially from<br>
the outside to the inside through two separate, mirror-symmetrically identical reaction<br>
spaces The product streams are combined in the middle plane of the stirred reactor (33),<br>
and the product having a temperature of 274°C is discharged via line (34). Via line (35),<br>
the required vacuum is generated, and at the same time the vapors formed during<br>
prepolycondensation are discharged for the purpose of recovering EG. The product stream<br>
discharged via line (34) is divided in two partial streams, which are each charged to a<br>
stirred reactor (38, 39) for polycondensation via line (36) and line (37), respectively. The<br>
polycondensation product, which has a temperature of 282°C, is each discharged from the<br>
stirred reactors (38, 39) via lines (40, 41). The vacuum required in the stirred reactors is<br>
applied via lines (42, 43). Two reactors on the one hand serve to maximize the entire plant<br>
capacity and on the other hand serve the polymer diversification as well as a decentralized<br>
product distribution during direct spinning.<br>
According to Fig. 2a it is also possible to charge the partial stream flowing off via line (36)<br>
at the front and the partial stream flowing off via line (37) at the back of a stirred reactor<br>
(44) with perforated disks and ring disks and supply the partial streams axially from the<br>
outside to the inside through two separate, mirror-symmetrically identical reaction spaces.<br>
The product stream formed of the combined partial streams is discharged in the middle<br><br>
plane of the stirred reactor via line (45). Via line (46), the necessary vaccum is produced<br>
and the vapors formed during polycondensation are discharged.<br>
Another modification of the process in accordance with Fig. 2 is shown in Fig 2b.<br>
Accordingly, from the product stream of prepolycondensated PET discharged via line (34),<br>
amorphous or partially crystalline chips can first be produced in a granulating system (47),<br>
via line (48) said chips can be supplied to a crystallizer system (49) with a temperature of<br>
210°C, and via line (50) can subsequently be charged to a solid-state polycondensation in<br>
an inert gas stream at temperatures up to 230°C in a vertical tubular reactor (51) known as<br>
SSP reactor (SSP = Solid State Polycondensation). The finished chips are discharged from<br>
the SSP reactor via line (52).<br>
For the continuous production of polybutylene terephthalate (PBT), PTA and butanediol<br>
(BDO) are mixed and, as shown in Fig. 3, the paste-like mixture is fed via line (53) into<br>
line (54) with heat exchanger (55) mounted therein, and is divided in two partial product<br>
streams of equal amounts, which via line (56) and line (57) are then introduced into the<br>
separate input stories (58 and 59, respectively) disposed in parallel of a story-type reactor<br>
(60) for esterification at a temperature of 245°C and a pressure of 400 mbar (abs). The<br>
separately guided partial product streams are combined in the intermediate story (61) and<br>
discharged from the bottom space (62) via line (63). Upon withdrawal of the esterification<br>
product via line (64) and introduction of the raw materials via line (65), a major amount of<br>
this product stream is recirculated to the top of the story-type reactor (60) in line (54). Via<br>
line (65), the remainder of the product stream discharged from the story-type reactor (60)<br>
is supplied to the reaction stage (66), in which prepolycondensation is effected at a<br>
temperature of 240°C and a pressure of 20 mbar (abs). For polycondensation, the<br>
prepolycondensation product is supplied via line (67) to a stirred reactor (68), from which<br>
the finished PBT is discharged via line (69).<br>
The mixture of water, tetrahydrofurane (THF) and BDO, which was formed during<br>
esterification, is treated in a rectification column, THF and water as top product are<br>
recirculated to a THF recovery, and BDO as bottom product is again charged to the story-<br>
type reactor (60). The vapors from the prepolycondensation stage (66) and from the stirred<br>
reactor (68) are sucked off via lines (70, 71) to separate vacuum systems and for the<br>
purpose of recirculating BDO are subjected to a partial condensation.<br><br>

granulating system (47), a crystalliser system (49) and a solids<br>
polycondensation stage consisting of a vertical tubular reactor (51).<br><br>
Device for the continuous production of polyesters, copolyesters or<br>
polycarbonates by esterification of dicarboxylic acids or dicarboxylic acid esters<br>
and diols or by reesterification of dialkyl carbonates or diaryl carbonates with<br>
bisphenols in at least one reaction stage (2,4,22,24,25,60), prepolycondensation<br>
of the esterification or reesterification product in at least one reaction stage<br>
(12,33,66) and polycondensation of the prepolycondensation product in at least<br>
one reaction stage (17,38,39,44,68), in at least one of the reaction stages a<br>
product stream supplied being divisible into at least two partial streams before or<br>
within the reaction stage and the partial streams being conductible completely or<br>
partially separately from each other through the reaction stage (12,33,44,60)<br>
which, being a cascade reactor or a cage reactor, is designed with at least two<br>
spatially separate sections divided into partial chambers through which<br>
sequential separate flow is possible characterized in that a reaction stage,<br>
conducting the partial streams, to the prepolycondensation or polycondensation<br>
(33,44) is designed either as an impeller disc reactor with two separate mirror-<br>
symmetrically identical reaction chambers or that a reaction stage, conducting<br>
the partial streams, to prepolycondensation or reesterification (12,60) is<br>
designed as a multiplate reactor with plates regulated in parallel (10, 11, 58, 59)<br>
for conducting the partial streams.</td>
