BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
This non-provisional application claims priority from U.S.<br>
Provisional Application S.N. 60/390,285 filed June 20, 2002, and<br>
U.S. Provisional Application 60/450,478 filed February 27, 2003.<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The invention relates to processes for the preparation of<br>
oxazolyl esters which are useful in preparing pharmaceutically<br>
active compounds. The invention further comprises methods of<br>
preparing the final active compounds. The invention further<br>
comprises compounds useful in the preparation of compounds and<br>
pharmaceutical compositions to treat Alzheimer"s disease and<br>
related conditions.<br>
Description of the Related Art<br>
Synthesis 583 (1996) discloses the coupling of aryl halides<br>
or aryl triflates with an oxazol-2-yl zinc chloride to provide<br>
the corresponding aryl oxazolyl. The invention provides a<br>
method for performing the coupling that unexpectedly affords<br>
improved yields and in many cases, shorter reaction times.<br>
The methods described herein are also suitable for the<br>
preparation of compounds and./or intermediates disclosed in WO<br>

The invention provides methods of converting compounds of<br>
formula III into compounds of formula III-a. Such methods are<br>
outlined in schemes B and C (wherein Xx is as defined below) and<br>
are discussed in more detail below. Methods for converting an<br>
ester into an amide are well known in the art. Such methods<br>
include, for example, base hydrolysis using LiOH, NaOH, or KOH<br>
as the base, or acid hydrolysis using HC1, H2SO4, H3PO4, triflic<br>
acid, para-toluene sulfonic acid, or HNO3. The invention also<br>
contemplates the use of two or more acids in combination or two<br>
or more bases in combination to effect the hydrolysis. Other<br>
methods will be readily apparent to one of skill in the art.<br>
The conversion of the acid into the acid chloride is<br>
preferably accomplished by using S0Cl2, SO2Cl2, or oxalyl<br>
chloride. Other reagents known in the art can be conveniently<br>
used to effect this transformation. :<br>
The conversion of the acid into the imidazolyl compound is<br>
preferably carried out using carbonyl diimidazole (CDI.)<br>
The conversion of the acid into an acid anhydride is<br>
accomplished by treating the acid with another acid anhydride,<br>
such as acetic anhydride (thereby forming a mixed anhydride), or<br>
the conversion can be effected by dehydrating two acid molecules<br>
through the use of heat or another dehydrating agent. Treatment<br>
with an acid anhydride is more preferable. On an industrial<br>
scale, heating is one preferred method of preparing the<br>
anhydride.<br>
The processes of the invention are outlined in the<br>
following Schemes.<br>
The oxazolyl ester III can be used in situ or isolated.<br>
Those skilled in the art when trying to remove zinc salts often<br>
add acid so the zinc salts precipitate. Here if acid is added,<br>
the desired oxazolyl ester III will protonate and will also<br>
precipitate. Therefore, it is preferred to work-up the reaction<br>
by adding saturated ammonium chloride solution to the crude<br>
reaction mixture and extracting with a suitable organic solvent<br>
such as ethyl acetate. This work up method allows for the<br>
partition of the oxazolyl ester III into the organic phase with<br>
the zinc salts remaining in the aqueous phase.<br>
Scheme A illustrates the preparation of the ZnCl2/oxazole<br>
adduct. The scheme discloses the use of solid ZnCl2. Solutions<br>
of ZnCl2 can be used, but solid ZnCl2 is preferred. The<br>
alkyllithium base used can be n-butyllithium t-butyllithium,<br>
sec-butyllithium, or methyllithium. N-butyl lithium is<br>
preferred. The lithiation of oxazoles has been described in<br>
Hodges, et al. , J. Org. Chem. 1991, 56, 449; and Whitney, S. E.,<br>
et al. , J. Org. Chem. 1991, 56, 3058 and in references cited<br>
therein.<br>
Scheme B illustrates a reaction between a compound of<br>
formula I (wherein R6 is di-n-propylamine, X is Br, and R1 is<br>
alkoxy) and a zinc chloride/oxazole adduct of formula II to form<br>
a coupled product of formula III. The ester is then hydrolyzed<br>
or otherwise cleaved to form the carboxylic acid.<br>
Scheme C illustrates the conversion of a carboxylic acid of<br>
formula IV into an acid halide or an imidazolide (compound of<br>
formula V wherein X1 is Cl or imidazolyl, respectively), or an<br>
acid anhydride (compound of formula VI) . Scheme C further<br>
illustrates the coupling of the acid (IV) , acid chloride (or<br>
bromide) (V), acid anhydride (VI) or imidazolide (V) with the<br>
amine of formula VIII to generate a compound of formula X. The<br>
arnine and/or alcohol in compounds of formula VIII may be<br>
protected before the coupling reaction is performed. One of<br>
skill in the art can determine the need for the use of<br>
protecting groups. See for example, "Protective Groups in<br>
Organic Synthesis, third edition" by Wuts and Green. These<br>
couplings are also known to those of skill in the art. The<br>
coupled compounds of formula X are generally disclosed in<br>
International Publication WO 02/02512 based on PCT/US01/21012<br>
International Publication WO02/02512 further discloses that<br>
the substituted amines of formula X are prepared by reacting the<br>
RN acid, acid halide, anhydride or carbonyl imidazole compound<br>
with the corresponding amine of formula VIII.<br>
Schemes D and E disclose a method for preparing one<br>
possible amine of formula VIII.<br>
Scheme F illustrates a coupling of a compound of formula I<br>
with an amine of formula VIII to form the amide of formula XI.<br>
In this scheme, it should be noted that the compound of formula<br>
I has not been coupled to the zinc chloride/oxazole adduct<br>
before being coupled to the amine of formula VIII. Compound XI<br>
can then be coupled to the zinc chloride/oxazole adduct to form<br>
compound XII. The protecting group can then be removed to form<br>
the compound of formula X.<br>

added dropwise over approximately 20 min. The reaction<br>
temperature rises to about 80° during the addition of the<br>
aqueous base. The reaction mixture is stirred very vigorous<br>
while the temperature slowly drops to 50° (over about 3 hr).<br>
After 3 hours, the reaction mixture is cooled down to 20-25°,<br>
water (100 ml) is added and the mixture stirred for 5 min. The<br>
organic phase is separated and the aqueous phase is extracted<br>
with dichloromethane (3 x) . The combined organic phases are<br>
washed with water and dilute hydrochloric acid. The organic<br>
phase is then dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered and<br>
concentrated. The concentrate is purified by a high vacuum<br>

(120 ml.) Before the addition is complete, benzotriazole<br>
hydrochloride started separating out as a white solid. The<br>
reaction mixture is stirred for an additional 15 min and then<br>
the solids are filtered off. The filtrate is stirred with<br>
anhydrous magnesium sulfate (2 g) to destroy an excess reagent.<br>
The solids are filtered off and the filtrate is concentrated<br>
under reduced pressure and dried under high vacuum for<br>

1.2 equivalent) is added in one portion. The reaction mixture<br>
is refluxed for 3 hr under nitrogen, then it is cooled to 20-25°<br>
before partitioning between aqueous saturated sodium carbonate<br>
and ethyl acetate. The organic phase is separated and the<br>
aqueous phase is extracted with ethyl acetate (3 x 25 ml). The<br>
