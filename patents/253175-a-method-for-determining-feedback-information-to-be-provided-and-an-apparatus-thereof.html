WO 2006/138622							PCT/US2006/023584<br><br>
NEGOTIATED CHANNEL INFORMATION REPORTING IN A WIRELESS COMMUNICATION SYSTEM<br>
Claim of Priority under 35 U.S.C. §119<br>
[0001] The present Application for Patent claims priority to Provisional Application No. 60/691,704 entitled "NEGOTIATED CHANNEL INFORMATION REPORTING IN A WIRELESS COMMUNICATION SYSTEM" filed June 16, 2005, and assigned to the assignee hereof and hereby expressly incorporated by reference herein.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Field<br>
[0002] The present description relates generally to wireless communication and more specifically to feedback of channel quality information (CQI) in a wireless communication system.<br>
Background<br>
[0003] An orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) system utilizes orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). OFDM is a multi-carrier modulation technique that partitions the overall system bandwidth into multiple (N) orthogonal frequency subcarriers. These subcarriers may also be called tones, bins, and frequency channels. Each subcarrier is associated with a respective sub carrier that may be modulated with data. Up to N modulation symbols may be sent on the N total subcarriers in each OFDM symbol period. These modulation symbols are converted to the time-domain with an N-point inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT) to generate a transformed symbol that contains N time-domain chips or samples. <br>
[0004] In a frequency hopping communication system, data is transmitted on different frequency subcarriers during different time intervals, which may be referred to as "hop periods." These frequency subcarriers may be provided by orthogonal frequency division multiplexing, other multi-carrier modulation techniques, or some other constructs. With frequency hopping, the data transmission hops from subcarrier to subcarrier in a pseudo-random manner. This hopping provides frequency diversity and<br><br>
WO 2006/138622	 	PCT/US2006/023584<br><br>
allows the data transmission to better withstand deleterious path effects such as narrowband interference, jamming, fading, and so on.<br>
[0005] Feedback of Channel Quality Indicator (CQI), e.g. channel information in a MIMO system is generally more challenging than CQI feedback for SISO systems. For SISO users, the CQI is computed at the access terminal (AT), using pilots sent over a dedicated control or signaling channel (FL-CTRL) or a data channel (FL-data). The CQI is fedback using a dedicated resource of a reverse link signaling or control channel (RL-CTRL).<br>
[0006] Existing CQI feedback schemes assume a CQI table with a deterministic mapping scheme between the quantized CQI values and the packet-formats that can be supported by the AT. However, future wireless systems will support ATs with different capabilities (laptops, low-cost cell-phones, PCs, PDAs etc). This provides a great range of CQI quantization possibilities and thus increases the complexity of the feedback required. Furthermore, the deployments of next-generation wireless systems can vary hot-spots, partially loaded systems, fully loaded systems etc. Further, the different access points may vary from being configured for SISO to MIMO operation. Each of the scenarios generally requires different gradations of CQI quantization, and this further increases the complexity of the CQI feedback.<br>
[0007] Thus, there exists a need in the art for a system and/or a methodology to optimize CQI feedback for different scenarios while at the same time maintaining the possibility of supporting the different scenarios.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0008] The following presents a simplified overview or summary of one or more embodiments in order to provide a basic understanding of such embodiments. This summary is not intended to be an extensive overview of all contemplated embodiments, and it is not intended to identify key or critical elements of all embodiments nor is it intended to delineate the scope of any or all embodiments.

[0022] Moreover, various aspects or features described herein may be implemented as a method, apparatus, or article of manufacture using standard programming and/or engineering techniques. The term "article of manufacture" as used herein is intended to encompass a computer program accessible from any computer-readable device, carrier, or media. For example, computer readable media can include but are not limited to magnetic storage devices (e.g., hard disk, floppy disk, magnetic strips...), optical disks (e.g., compact disk (CD), digital versatile disk (DVD)...), smart cards, and flash memory devices (e.g., card, stick, key drive...).<br>
[0023] Referring to Fig. 1, a multiple access wireless communication system according to one embodiment is illustrated.   A multiple access wireless communication system<br><br>
WO 2006/138622	 	PCT/US2006/023584<br>
100 includes multiple cells, e.g. cells 102, 104, and 106. In the embodiment of Fig. 1, each cell 102, 104, and 106 may include an access point 150 that includes multiple sectors. The multiple sectors may be formed by groups of antennas each responsible for communication with access terminals in a portion of the cell. In cell 102, antenna groups 112, 114, and 116 each correspond to a different sector. In cell 104, antenna groups 118, 120, and 122 each correspond to a different sector. In cell 106, antenna groups 124,126, and 128 each correspond to a different sector.<br>
[0024] Each cell includes several access terminals which may be in communication with one or more sectors of each access point. For example, access terminals 130 and 132 are in communication base station 142, access terminals 134 and 136 are in communication with access point 144, and access terminals 138 and 140 are in communication with access point 146.<br>
[0025] It can be seen from Fig. 1 that each access terminal 130, 132, 134, 136, 138, and 140 is located in a different portion of it respective cell relative to each other access terminal in the same cell. Further, each access terminal may be a different distance from the corresponding antenna groups with which it is communicating. Both of these factors provide situations, due to environmental and other conditions in the cell, which cause different channel conditions to be present between each access terminal and the corresponding antenna group with which it is communicating.<br>
[0026] In certain aspects, each access terminal 130, 132, 134, 136, 138, and 140 may negotiate a feedback scheme, e.g. a CQI table that it will utilize to provide feedback for providing channel state information to the access point. In some aspects, this may be by selecting one or more feedback tables, or equivalents thereto, received via an over the air message from the access point. In other aspects, it may be a communication session between the access point and the access terminal after registration with the access point. [0027] As used herein, a CQI table may encompass any set of information that may be used to associate an indicator to sets of values indicative of channel conditions. <br>
[0028] As used herein, an access point may be a fixed station used for communicating with the terminals and may also be referred to as, and include some or all the functionality of a base station.   An access terminal may also be referred to as, and include  some  or all  the  functionality of,  a  user equipment  (UE),  a  wireless communication device, a terminal, a mobile station or some other terminology. <br>
[0029] Referring to Fig. 2, one embodiment of a transmitter and receiver in a multiple access wireless communication system is illustrated. At transmitter system 210, traffic<br><br>
WO 2006/138622	 	PCT/US2006/023584<br>
data for a number of data streams is provided from a data source 212 to a transmit (TX) data processor 214. In an embodiment, each data stream is transmitted over a respective transmit antenna. TX data processor 214 formats, codes, and interleaves the traffic data for each data stream based on a particular coding scheme selected for that data stream to provide coded data. In some embodiments, TX data processor 214 applies precoding weights to the symbols of the data streams based upon the user and the antenna from which the symbols are being transmitted. In some embodiments, the precoding weights may be generated based upon an index to a codebook generated at the receiver 202 and provided as feedback to the transmitter 200 which has knowledge of the codebook and its indices. Further, in those cases of scheduled transmissions, the TX data processor 214 can select the packet format based upon rank information that is transmitted from the user.<br>
[0030] The coded data for each data stream may be multiplexed with pilot data using OFDM techniques. The pilot data is typically a known data pattern that is processed in a known manner and may be used at the receiver system to estimate the channel response. The multiplexed pilot and coded data for each data stream is then modulated (i.e., symbol mapped) based on a particular modulation scheme (e.g., BPSK, QSPK, M-PSK, or M-QAM) selected for that data stream to provide modulation symbols. The data rate, coding, and modulation for each data stream may be determined by instructions performed by processor 230. As discussed above, in some embodiments, the packet format for one or more streams may be varied according to the rank information that is transmitted from the user.<br>
[0031] The modulation symbols for all data streams are then provided to a TX MIMO processor 220, which may further process the modulation symbols (e.g., for OFDM). TX MTMO processor 220 then provides NT modulation symbol streams to NT transmitters (TMTR) 222a through 222t. In certain embodiments, TX MTMO processor 220 applies precoding weights to the symbols of the data streams based upon the user to which the symbols are being transmitted to and the antenna from which the symbol is being transmitted from that user channel response information.<br>
[0032] Each transmitter 222 receives and processes a respective symbol stream to provide one or more analog signals, and further conditions (e.g., amplifies, filters, and upconverts) the analog signals to provide a modulated signal suitable for transmission over the MTMO channel. NT modulated signals from transmitters 222a through 222t are then transmitted from NT antennas 224a through 224t, respectively.<br><br>
WO 2006/138622	 	PCT/US2006/023584<br>
 [0033] At receiver system 250, the transmitted modulated signals are received by NR antennas 252a through 252r and the received signal from each antenna 252 is provided to a respective receiver (RCVR) 254. Each receiver 254 conditions (e.g., filters, amplifies, and downconverts) a respective received signal, digitizes the conditioned signal to provide samples, and further processes the samples to provide a corresponding "received" symbol stream.<br>
[0034] An RX data processor 260 then receives and processes the NR received symbol streams from NR receivers 254 based on a particular receiver processing technique to provide Nr "detected" symbol streams. The processing by RX data processor 260 is described in further detail below. Each detected symbol stream includes symbols that are estimates of the modulation symbols transmitted for the corresponding data stream. RX data processor 260 then demodulates, deinterleaves, and decodes each detected symbol stream to recover the traffic data for the data stream. The processing by RX data processor 260 is complementary to that performed by TX MIMO processor 220 and TX data processor 214 at transmitter system 210.<br>
[0035] The channel response estimate generated by RX processor 260 may be used to perform space, space/time processing at the receiver, adjust power levels, change modulation rates or schemes, or other actions. RX processor 260 may further estimate the signal-to-noise-and-interference ratios (SNRs) of the detected symbol streams, and possibly other channel characteristics, and provides these quantities to a processor 270. RX data processor 260 or processor 270 may further derive an estimate of the "operating" SNR for the system. Processor 270 then provides estimated (CSI), which may comprise various types of information regarding the communication link and/or the received data stream. For example, the CSI may comprise only the operating SNR. The CSI is then processed by a TX data processor 238, which also receives traffic data for a number of data streams from a data source 276, modulated by a modulator 280, conditioned by transmitters 254a through 254r, and transmitted back to transmitter system 210.<br>
[0036] In addition, processor 270 may select the index(ces) or entry(ies) that correspond to the matrix(ces) or vector(s) that provide indications of some desired channel conditions, e.g. SNR, for the receiver 202 based upon the signals received by the receiver. Processor 270 can quantize the index or entry according to a feedback table, e.g. a CQI table, which is known at transmitter 200. In some embodiments, five-bit codes may be utilized allowing a wide range of channel conditions. The codebook size<br><br>
WO 2006/138622	 	PCT/US2006/023584<br>
and entries can vary per device, per sector, per cell, or per system and may be updated over time based upon communication conditions, system updates, or the like. As discussed with respect to Fig. 1, the feedback table that is utilized may be obtained by negotiation or selected from a broadcast message.<br>
[0037] At transmitter system 210, the modulated signals from receiver system 250 are received by antennas 224, conditioned by receivers 222, demodulated by a demodulator 240, and processed by a RX data processor 242 to recover the CSI reported by the receiver system. The reported quantized information e.g. CQI is then provided to processor 230 and used to (1) determine the data rates and coding and modulation schemes to be used for the data streams and (2) to generate various controls for TX data processor 214 and TX MIMO processor 220.<br>
[0038] At the receiver, various processing techniques may be used to process the NR received signals to detect the NT transmitted symbol streams. These receiver processing techniques may be grouped into two primary categories (i) spatial and space-time receiver processing techniques (which are also referred to as equalization techniques); and (ii) "successive nulling/equalization and interference cancellation" receiver processing technique (which is also referred to as "successive interference cancellation" or "successive cancellation" receiver processing technique).<br>
[0039] A MIMO channel formed by the NT transmit and NR receive antennas may be decomposed into Ns independent channels, with Ns 
independent channels may also be referred to as a spatial subchannel (or a transmission<br>
channel) of the MIMO channel and corresponds to a dimension.<br>
[0040] For a full-rank MIMO channel, where  Ns~ NT £NH, an independent data<br>
stream may be transmitted from each of the NT transmit antennas. The transmitted data streams may experience different channel conditions (e.g., different fading and multipath effects) and may achieve different signal-to-noise-and-interference ratios (SNRs) for a given amount of transmit power. Moreover, in those cases that successive interference cancellation processing is used at the receiver to recover the transmitted data streams, and then different SNRs may be achieved for the data streams depending on the specific order in which the data streams are recovered. Consequently, different data rates may be supported by different data streams, depending on their achieved SNRs. Since the channel conditions typically vary with time, the data rate supported by each data stream also varies with time.<br><br>
WO 2006/138622	 	PCT/US2006/023584<br>
 [0041] In some aspects, the CQI may be transmitted on a Code Division Multiplexed (CDM) channel and as a result the number of CQIs which can be sent is limited by the number of available codes. Thus, when a system is partially loaded, there are codes available to be used as a CQI, and when the system is fully loaded there are may be no codes which may be used as a CQI available. Thus, by using the codes available on a partially loaded system a precoding gain is achievable by dividing the available bandwidth, performing frequency hopping on the divided portions, reporting a channel quality index for each divided portion, and using the CQI in such a manner as to improve the precoding and also reduce the overhead required for precoding. <br>
[0042] CQI reporting may be done for each spatial subchannel, may be combined over multiple spatial subchannels, per frequency subcarrier, or combined for groups of frequency subcarries.<br>
[0043] Referring to Fig. 3, the table illustrates CQI mapping to the Forward Link (FL) Packet Format and Number of Forward Link Physical Frames. Fig. 3 illustrates the use of a 4-bit CQI value and use of a 5-bit CQI value. In an aspect, 4-bit CQI values are used for Single-Input-Multiple-Output (SIMO), and 5-bit CQI values are used with Multiple-Input-Multiple-Output (MIMO). An AT measures the Forward Link (FL) channel quality and determines a signal to noise ratio, e.g. Es/N0 value. The AT then does a lookup to quantize the CQI value which represents the signal to noise ratio. The AT transmits the CQI value to the Access Point (AP), and the AP does a table lookup to get the Es/N0 value. Now the AP knows the FL channel quality, and based on the FL channel quality the AP knows which packet formats are supported for the next transmission or transmissions.<br>
[0044] In one embodiment, an AP may maintain 10 CQI tables, and an AT may negotiate with an AP as to which CQI table to use. For example, in the case of an AT which supports 4 packet formats, it may be most efficient to use a 2-bit CQI value. In this scenario, an AT that can use a 2-bit CQI value, the coding and decoding complexity is decreased and Reverse Link (RL) capacity is improved. In an embodiment, a RL control channel capacity metric may be used to indicate the RL capacity. Also, in an embodiment, an AP decode complexity metric may be used to indicate the coding and decoding complexity of an AP. On the other hand, an AT which supports 64 packet formats may request a higher resolution CQI value, for example a 6-bit CQI value. The higher packet formats supports high data rates, and benefits from users using less resources such as time frequency resources.<br><br>
WO 2006/138622	 	PCT/US2006/023584<br>
 [0045] Referring to Fig. 4, in an embodiment, an AP may maintain a plurality of CQI tables, and an AT may maintain one or more CQI tables based on the AT's capabilities. The AT may advertise, through the Reverse Link (RL), to the AP the CQI tables the AT supports, 402. The AP then selects a CQI table to use based on the CQI tables supported by the AT, 404. The AP may inform the AT of the CQI table selected or the selection may be implicit, 406. The AP and the AT begin transmitting data using a packet format appropriate for the FL channel, 408. The AP may select a CQI table solely on the AT's capability. Also, for example, in the case of an AT that supports more than one CQI table, other factors such as system loading where system loading is determined by how much of the systems resources are being utilized. By using other factors along with the CQI tables supported by the AT, the network can optimize the performance of the AT's served by the AP.<br>
[0046] Referring to Fig. 5, in another embodiment the selection of a CQI table may be deployment specific. In such an embodiment this may occur when an AP that serves a hot-spot or supports high packet format applications and services. The AP may advertise one preferred CQI table or several preferred CQI tables, 502. In some cases and the AP may advertise several preferred CQI tables in order of preference or based on the application to be used by the AT. If the AT supports a CQI table preferred by the AP, the AT will notify the AP of one or more preferred CQI table it supports, 504. If the AT does not support one or more CQI tables advertised by the AP, 505, the AP may select its next preferred CQI table or tables, 508. The AP would then advertise its next preferred CQI table, 502. If the AT does support the CQI table, 505, the AP selects the preferred CQI table, 506, notifies the AT which CQI table to use, 510, and the AP and AT may begin transmitting data with the appropriate packet format 512. Alternatively, the AP may direct the AT of the CQI table to use, 510. All AT(s) that support a high packet format may use a CQI table as desired by the AP to optimize the performance between the AP(s) and AT(s).<br>
[0047] In yet another embodiment, the AP(s) may use the AT capability, system conditions, such as system loading, and type of deployment to advertise and/or decide which CQI table to use. Using these factors, the AP(s) may dynamically select which CQI table(s) to use to optimize performance between the AP(s) and AT(s). In another embodiment, the AP may simply send a high or low command to instruct the AT to use a high packet format or a low packet format. This may be useful for a heavily loaded AP.<br><br>

ABSTRACT<br>
NEGOTIATED CHANNEL INFORMATION REPORTING IN A WIRELESS COMMUNICATION SYSTEM<br>
Techniques to enhance the performance in a wireless communication system using CQI feedback optimized to support different scenarios According to one aspect, an access terminal may select a CQI feedback table based on the access terminals capability. According to another aspect, an access point may select a CQI feedback table based on an access terminals capability, system loading and the type of service provided by the access point. An access point which provides services that require high data rates may select a larger CQI feedback table to support the high data rates for access terminals which support the larger CQI feedback table. The same access point may select a smaller CQI feedback table for access terminals which do not have the capability or need for the high data rate services.<br></td>
