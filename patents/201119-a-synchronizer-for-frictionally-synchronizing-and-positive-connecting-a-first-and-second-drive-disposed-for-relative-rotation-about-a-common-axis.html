FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a synchronizer having self-energizing and means to limit force provided by the self-energizing means.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Synchronizers for use in multi-ratio transmissions are well known. Such synchronizers include pairs of friction and jaw members for respectively synchronizing and positively clutching a gear to a shaft, pre-energizer assemblies for engaging the friction members in response to initial engaging movement of a shift sleeve, a hub rotatably fixed to the shaft and having external spline teeth slidably receiving internal spline teeth of the shift sleeve which often defines one of the jaw member pairs, a baulkring having blocker teeth for arresting engaging movement of the shift sleeve until synchronization is reached and for transferring a shift force from the sleeve to increase the engaging force of the friction members.<br>
It is also known that such synchronizers may be used to reduce shift time and shift effort required by a vehicle operator by providing the synchronizes with self-energizing means and that springs may be used to limit forces provided by the self-energizing means. US-A-5 678 670 discloses a synchronizer having all of the above features and US-A-5 544 727 discloses all but the spring regulating feature.<br><br>
1A SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
An object of this invention is to provide a synchronizer with self-energizing and improved force limiting of the self-energizing.<br>
The invention relates to a synchronizer, as disclosed in US-A-5, 544, 727 which represents the pre-characterizing part of claim. The synchronizer frictionally synchronizes and positively connects first and second drives disposed for relative rotation about a common axis, and the synchronizer comprises: A first element affixed against rotation and axial movement relative to the first drive and has an annular periphery with external splines.<br>
A second element includes an annular periphery with internal splines defining first jaw means and ax tally movable from a neutral position to an engaged position with second jaw means for positively connecting the drives in response to engaging movement of the second element by an axially directed first shift force (Fo). The second element includes internal splines mating continuously with the external splines in close slidable relation for<br><br>
A first ring includes a first friction surface axially movable into engagement with a second friction surface in response to the engaging movement of the second element for producing a synchronizing torque (f 0). First and second pluralities of blocker surfaces are movable into engagement in response to the engaging movement of the second element for preventing asynchronous engagement of the jaw means and for transmitting the first shift force (Fo) to the first friction surface to effect ah engagement force of the friction surfaces. The second plurality of blocker surfaces are affixed to the first ring. Pluralities of first and second self-energizing means respectively include first and second ramps operative when engaged to react the synchronizing torque for producing an additive axial force (Fa) in the direction of the first shift force (Fo) and for increasing the engagement force of the friction surfaces. One of the first and second self-energizing means includes means for directing the additive axial force (Fa) to the first friction surface via the!blocker surfaces. Each of the first self-energizing means are mounted on one of the elements and each of the second self-energizing means are mounted for non-radial movement and limited rotation relative to another of the elements.<br>
so t"Anou"Th'e improvement is characterized by resilient means for limiting the additive axial force to a predetermined amount. Each of the first self-energizing means including a member movably mounted on the one of the elements and defining one of the first self-energizing ramps. The member is movable against the resilient means in response to the additive axial force (Fa) exceeding the predetermined amount.<br>

Detailed Description of the Drawings<br>
The term "synchronizer" shall designate a clutch mechanism utilized to non-rotatably couple a selected ratio gear to a shaft by means of a positive clutch in which attempted engagement of the positive clutch is prevented until members of the positive clutch are brought to substantially synchronous rotation by a synchronizing friction clutch associated with the positive clutch. The term "self-energizing" shall designate a synchronizer which includes ramps or cams or the like to increase the engaging force of the synchronizing proportion to the synchronizing torque of the friction clutch.<br>
Looking now at Figures 1-10, therein is shown a gear and synchronizer assembly 10 which forms part of a multi-ratio change speed transmission. Assembly 10 includes a shaft 12 mounted for rotation about a central axis 12a, axially spaced apart gears 14,16 supported on the shaft for rotation relative thereto and secured against axial movement relative to the shaft in known manner, and a double-acting synchronizer 18.<br>
The synchronizer 18 includes annular members 20,22 axially and rotatably affixed to gears 14,16 in known manner, gear friction surfaces 24,26 herein integral with members 20,22, gear jaw teeth 28,30 herein integral with members 20,22, a hub member 32 axially and rotatably affixed at a central opening 32a thereof to shaft 12, a shift sleeve 34, internal spline teeth 36 defined on a central opening of sleeve 34 and in constant mesh with external spline teeth 38 defined on the outer circumference of hub 32, baulkrings 40,42, blocker teeth sets 44,46 and friction surfaces 48,50 herein integral with baulkrings 40.42, pre-energizer assemblies 52, and a self-energizing/blocker assembly 54. Herein, the synchronizer includes three circumferentially spaced apart self-energizing/blocker assemblies 54 which cooperate with a like number of blocker teeth on each baulkring, and three circumferentially spaced apart pre-energizer assemblies. Each blocker tooth 44,46 respectively includes angled blocker surfaces 44a,44b,46a,46b.<br>
As is readily seen, friction surfaces 24,48 and 26,50 pair up to define friction clutches for synchronizing the gears to the shaft prior to engagement of the jaw clutch members. Cone clutches are preferred; however, other types of friction clutches may be used.   The friction<br>
-3-<br><br>
4<br>
friction surfaces may be defined by any of several known friction materials affixed to the base member, e.g,, pyrolytic carbon friction materials such as disclosed in U.S. Patents 4,700,823; 4,844,218 and 4,778,548 may be used.<br>
Spline teeth 36, 38 have axially extending flank surfaces 36a, 38a which continuously mate in close sliding relation so that there is relatively no free play between shift sleeve 34 and shaft 12. Opposite ends of splines 36 define jaw teeth 36b, 36c which respectively rn3te with gear teeth 28, 30 to positive clutch the gears to the shaft. The flank sides of jaw teeth 36b, 36c and of gear jaw teeth 28, 30 may be provided with an antibackout or a locking angle feature to prevent inadvertent disengagement of the teeth. Details of this feature may be seen by reference to U.S Patent 4,727,968.<br>
Each pre-energizer assembly 52 includes a helical compression spring 58 and plunger 60 disposed in a radially extending blind bore in hub 32 and biasing a roller or ball 62 (herein a roller) into an annular detent groove 36d in shift sleeve splines 36. Pre-energizer assembly 52 resiliency positions shift sleeve 34 in the neutral position shown in Figure 1. Rollers 62 are axially spaced between abutment surfaces 64a, 66a defined by a plurality of tabs 64, 66 (herein three) formed integral with baulkrings 40, 42. The tabs extend into recesses 32b in hub 32 for limiting rotation of the baulking relative to the hub and shaft.<br>
When it is desired to coupled either gear to the shaft, an appropriate and unshown shift mechanism, such as disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,920,815, moves shift sleeve 34 axially via a partially shown shift fork 68 along the axis of shaft 12<br><br>
4a<br>
either left to couple gear 14 or right to couple gear 16. The shift mechanism may be manually moved by an operator through a linkage system, may be selectively moved by an actuator, or may be moved by means which automatically initiate shift mechanism movement and which also controls the magnitude of the force applied by the shift mechanism. When the shift mechanism is manually moved, pre-energizer assemblies apply a pre - energizer force proportional to the force applied by the operator the shift sleeve. Whether manually or automatically applied, the force is applied to the shift sleeve in an axial direction and is proportional to a shift force hereinafter referred to as an operator shift force Fo. The pre-energizer force, depending on direction of shift sleeve movement by the shift force (F0)f moves either friction surface 48 or 50 into initial engagement with its associated friction surface to clock the associated baulking to a position relative to hub 32 for positioning the self-energizing/ blocker assemblies 54 in a manner explained hereinafter.<br>
The self-energizing / biocker assemblies 54 each include self-energizing members 70, 72 the blocker teeth 44, 46, a rigid self- energizing / blocker member 74 which reacts self energizing and blocker forces, and detent assemblies 76, 78 respectively biasing members 70,72 to the positions of Figure 6. Assemblies 76,78 are identical; hence only assemble 76 is described in detail. Assembly 76 includes a round headed detent member 80 biased into a detent groove 70a in member 70 by a compression spring 81 disposed in a blind bore 32c In the hub. Member 70 is stidably disposed in a slot having axially extending sidewalls 32d, 32e that diverge as they extend radially inward for slidably embracing like diverging sidewalis 70b, 70c of member 70. The sidewalls prevent<br><br>
5<br>
radially outward movement of member 70. Detent groove ?0a include detent ramps 70d, 70e which prevent axial movement of member 70 until axial forces acting on self - energizing or boost ramps 71a, 71b of member 70 exceed a predetermined centering force provided by spring 81, and the curved centering surface defined by groove 70a and detent ramps 70d, 70e. To prevent interference of member 70 sidewalfs with baulkrings 40, 42 when member 70 moves axially as seen in Figure 9, portions of axial ends of side walls 70b, 70c are removed in a manner seen in Figure 10 for sidewall 70b.<br>
Rigid member 74 includes circumferentially spaced apart end portions 82, 84 rigidly secured together by a circumferentially extending portion 86 received in a circumferentially extending slot 34a in shift sleeve 34. Slot 34a allows limited circumferential movement of member 74 therein relative to the sleeve and prevents axial movement herein relative to the sleeve. End portion 82 includes self - energizing ramp surfaces 82a, 82b which respectively react against self -energizing ramp surfaces 71a, 71b when shift sleeve 34 is moved axially left or right and blocker surfaces 82c, 82d which respectively react against blocker surfaces 44a, 46a of blocker teeth 44, 46. In a like manner, end portion 84 includes self - energizing ramp surfaces 84a, 84b for respectively reacting against self - energizing ramp surfaces 73a, 73b and blocker surfaces 84c, 84d which respectively react against blocker surfaces 44b, 46b. Non - self -energizing ramp surfaces 82e, 84e respectively react against surfaces 71c, 73c when the synchronizer is in the neutral position of Figures 1 and 6. The engaged<br><br>
5a<br>
position of the non - self - energizing surfaces prevents unwanted activation of the self - energizing ramp surfaces in the event there is some amount of torque produced by one of the cone dutches, e. g. viscous shear of oii between the cone clutch friction surfaces may produce a torque that could otherwise activate the ramps.<br>
Function of self - energizing / blocker assemblies 76 are described relative to Figures 1 and 6-9. The description assumes as asynchronous condition in one direction exists between shaft 12 and gear 16. When the blocker and self -energizing ramp surfaces are engaged as shown in Figure 3 friction surfaces 50, 26 are also engaged. Axial extensions 44c, 46c of blocker teeth 44, 46 keep the blocker teeth circumferentially positioned between end portions 82, 84. Asynchronous conditions in the other direction or for gear 14 produce surface engagements that should be obvious from the following description. Figure 6 illustrates a "neutral position* of all synchronizer components. Initial rightward axial movement of shift sleeve 34 by the operator shift force Fo is transmitted by pre - energizer rollers 62 to baulkring 42 via tab abutment surfaces 66a to effect initial frictional engagement of movable cone surface 50 with gear cone surface 26, thereby producing an initial synchronizing torque for rotating blocker surfaces 46a to positions ensuring contact with blocker surfaces 82d. The initial rightward movement also moves rigid member 74 enough for non - self - energizing ramp surfaces 71c, 82e to axially disengage and allow the initial synchronizing torque to engage blocker surfaces 82b, 46am, as seen in Figure 8. The initial engagement force of the cone surface is, of course, a function of the force of spring 58 and the angles of the walls of detent grooves 36d. In the 'blocking /<br><br>
6<br>
self - energizing position" of Figure 8, the torque has rotated baulkring 42 and rigid members 74 enough to also engage self - energizing ramp surfaces 71b, 82b. Hence, Figure 8 surfaces 82d, 82b are trapped between baulkring blocker surfaces 46a and self - energizing ramp surfaces 71b. When these surfaces are so trapped and ignoring the effect of the engaged self - energizing ramp surfaces 82b, 71b, full operator shift force Fo applied to rigid member 74 from shift sleeve 34 is transmitted across blocker surfaces 82d, 46a, thereby engaging friction surfaces 26, 50 with the operator shift force Fo for producing a synchronizing torque To proportional to the operator shift force Fo. Since blocker surfaces 82d, 46a are oblique to the plane of rotation, they in addition to preventing asynchronous engagement of jaw teeth 36a, 30 and transmitting the shift force Fo to friction surfaces 26, 50, also produce a counter torque or unblocking torque counter to the synchronizing torque but of lesser magnitude during asynchronous conditions. As substantial synchronism is reached, the synchronizing torque drops below the unblocking torque, whereby the blocker teeth move out of engagement to allow continued axial movement of the shift sleeve and engagement of movable jaw teeth 36c with gear jaw teeth 30.<br><br>
surfaces, thereby further increasing the engaging force of the friction surfaces to provide an additive synchronizing torque Ta which adds to the torque To.<br>
In the event that the self-energizing additive axial force Fa exceeds a predetermined amount, as determined by detent assemblies 76, member 70 will move leftward, as shown in Figure 9, and allow non-self-energizing surfaces 82e to move into balance positions. When in the balance positions, self-energizing ramp surfaces 82b,71b are engaged and non-self-energizing surfaces 82e engage axially extending surface portions 32f of sidewall 32d in hub 32 which do not produce an axial additive force component. When in this position, the maximum additive force Fa is limited to the force reacted by the detent assemblies 76 at the balance position since any synchronizing torque increase will be reacted by the non-self-energizing surfaces 82c,32f.<br>
The predetermined amounted of axial force provided by the detent assemblies 76,78 may be different for gears 14,16 and for up and down shifts by varying the angles of the detent ramps 70d,70e in each of members 70,72.<br>
