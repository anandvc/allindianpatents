				<td>PROCESS FOR PRODUCING MICA-CONTAINING INSULATING TAPES<br>
FOR WINDINGS<br>
This invention relates to a process for producing mica containing insulating tapes for<br>
winding elements of rotating high voltage electrical machinery which after winding under a<br>
vacuum and pressure can be impregnated with a solvent-free synthetic resin and then cured<br>
under the action of heat, and their use in the main insulation of rotating high voltage electrical<br>
machines.<br>
Prior Art<br>
To insulate winding elements in rotating high voltage electrical machines the impregnation<br>
technique based on vacuum pressure impregnation has become very popular in recent<br>
years, In doing so, the winding elements for construction engineering reasons are made<br>
either as preformed coils or conduct and scolds preferably performed bars. The winding elements<br>
are provided with mica-containing mail solution and are further tired in a vacuum<br>
pressure impregnation process. Here operator apreferably low-visco solvent-free resin<br>
systems, are used as the impregnation resins.<br>
At this point they impregnate in a vacuum and under pressure the mica-containing main<br>
insulation formed from several winding layers so that cavities which can cause partial<br>
discharges between the winding layers are completely filled so that after curing of the<br>
impregnation resin an electrically and mechanically stable insulating sleeve is formed. The<br>
winding layers of the main insulation are formed by mica-containing insulating tapes. They<br>
are produced such that a mica film is cemented to a porous carrier material using a binder.<br>
This porous mica-containing insulating tape is designed to absorb the aforementioned<br>
impregnation resin under a vacuum and pressure to the greatest possible extent.<br>
Mainly in generator construction in recent years has the demand grown for mica-containing<br>
insulating tapes which are to have not only good workability on modern winding machines,<br>
but also satisfactory impregnation capacity since due to the increasing size and power of<br>
generators likewise high insulating wall thicknesses have become necessary.<br>
Known insulating tapes can only partially meet this requirement since they act rather as<br>
barrier due to their physical and chemical composition relative to the penetrating<br>
impregnation resin so that at longer impregnation times the impregnation depth, i.e. the<br>
number of impregnated winding layers, is insufficient for high insulating wall thicknesse.<br>
Description of the Invention<br>
The object of this invention is therefore to devise a mica-containing insulating tape of the<br>
initially mentioned type which in addition to very good winding properties on modern<br>
automatic winding machines also exhibits much improved impregnation behavior during<br>
vacuum pressure impregnation. In addition, this mica-containing insulating tape should be<br>
easy to produce and stable in storage.<br>
The present invention provides a process for producing mica-containing insulating tapes for<br>
windings of rotating high voltage electrical machinery, said tapes, after winding under a<br>
vacuum and pressure can be impregnated with a solvent-free synthetic resin and then cured<br>
under the action of heat, said process comprising sprinkling an epoxy resin mixture in the<br>
form of a powder enamel, such as herein described, on a fiber-containing mica film, which<br>
in addition to fine mica is comprised also of organic/inorganic fibers in the amount of 3 to<br>
50%, the side of the fiber-containing mica film which has been sprinkled with said powder<br>
enamel, being cemented to a carrier material, such as herein described, under the pressure<br>
of at least 0.2 N/mm2 and at an elevated temperature higher than the softening point of the<br>
epoxy resin mixture.<br>
The epoxy resin mixture which is used in the form of a powder enamel may be selected from<br>
the group consisting of bisphenol-A epoxy resins, phenol-novolac epoxy resins and mixtures<br>
thereof.<br>
Preferably the carrier material consists of a glass fabric, a formed fabric or a plastic film.<br>
Introducing fibers into the mica film makes the latter more porous so that its capillary action is<br>
increased relative to the impregnation resin during vacuum pressure impregnation. The<br>
resulting advantages are shorter impregnation times and impregnation with more highly<br>
viscous resins to be able to impregnate also very high insulating wall thicknesses entirely<br>
with impregnation resin.<br>
It must be noted that a proportion of fiber less than 3% by weight does not contribute to<br>
improvement of the impregnation capacity; and a proportion of fiber exceeding 50% by<br>
weight even reduces the dielectric strength of the mica-containing insulating tape.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, organic and/or inorganic fibers in the fiber-<br>
containing mica film have an average diameter of 0.1 to 20 microns and preferably an<br>
average length of 0.5 to 10 mm.<br>
Furthermore, the organic fibers may be selected from the group consisting of aromatic<br>
polyamides and aromatic polyesters such as polyethylene terephthalate and the inorganic<br>
fibers may be selected from the group consisting of E-glass, S-glass, silicon glass and<br>
aluminium.<br>
According to another version of the process of the invention, the fiber-confining mica film has<br>
a curing accelerator, preferably zinc naphthenate, which acts on the solvent-free synthetic<br>
resin.<br>
In addition, the powdered enabel system can also give curing agent, preferably an<br>
aminic curing agent on the basis of a secondary and/ or aromatic amine in<br>
substituted or unsubstituted form whereby the epoxy resin mixture is comprised of a<br>
bisphenol-A epoxy resin and a phenol-novolac construction and ratio of 1:2.<br>
According to the present process the epoxy resin mixture which is used in the form of a<br>
powder enamel has preferably a softening point exceeding 85°C.<br>
The invention furthermore relates to use of a mica-containing insulating tape which was<br>
produced according to the aforementioned process versions as the main insulation in rotating<br>
high voltage electrical machines, the mica-containing insulating tape being wound in several<br>
layers around a winding element and then impregnated under a vacuum and pressure with a<br>
solvent-free synthetic resin.<br>
The epoxy resin may be in the form of a bisphenol-A epoxy resin, a phenol-novolac epoxy<br>
resin or a mixture thereof. These resins are characterized by the fact that they exhibit a<br>
softening point &gt; 85°C. Further the epoxy resin is preferably used in a mixture with an aminic<br>
curing agent selected on the basis of a secondary aliphatic and/or aromatic amine in<br>
substituted or unsubstituted form.<br>
Furthermore, in the aforementioned vacuum pressure impregnation preferably solvent-free<br>
synthetic resins such as for example epoxy acid anhydride mixtures based on bisphenol-A or<br>
bisphenol-F are used.<br>
Epoxy resin acid anhydride system structure and 60-70oC to have viscosity low<br>
enough for the impregnation process Mica containing Insulating tapes which have been<br>
produced according to the process as claimed the information can however satisfactorily<br>
impregnated at a much higher resin viscosin and therefore especially well suited for<br>
impregnation with resins which can only be heated to roughly 30°C and therefore have a<br>
mostly very high impregnation viscosity, for example polyester resins with styrene or vinyl<br>
alcohol as the monomer.<br>
One embodiment of the invention<br>
The invention will now be described in detail using the embodiments and the diagrams<br>
prepared using the embodiments as shown in Figures 1 and 2, of the accompanying<br>
drawings which show diagrams.<br>
Example 1<br>
A fiber-confining mica film with a weight of 160 g/m2 consisting of a mixture of uncalcined<br>
muscovite or phlogopite and 5% by weight alkali-free E-glass short fibers which have a<br>
diameter of on average 8 microns and a fiber length of roughly 3 mm is impregnated with a<br>
solution of zinc naphthenate in methylethyl ketone and the solvent is evaporated. The fiber-<br>
containing mica film which has been preimpregnated with roughly 4 g/m2 naphthenate is<br>
sprinkled with a powdered epoxy resin mixture with a softening point &gt; 85°C and by means<br>
of a heatable calender under pressure and the action of heat is cemented to the carrier<br>
material. To achieve especially satisfactory impregnation values during vacuum pressure<br>
impregnation a curing agent, preferably an aminic curing agent, can be added to the epoxy<br>
resin mixture.<br>
The following can be used as the term and condition.<br>
a) a glass fabric with a mass per unit area of 23 g/m2 which is coated with 2 g/m2 of a flexibly<br>
cross-linking acrylic resin and then is temperature-treated in an oven at 100°C to cure the<br>
acrylic resin; or<br>
b) a glass fabric with a mass per unit area of 23 g/m2 which is coated with 0.5 g/m2 zinc<br>
naphthenate; or.<br>
c) a polyester formed fabric with a mass per unit area of 20 g/m2, or<br>
d) a polyester film with a mass per unit area of 42 g/m2.<br>
Example 2<br>
A fiber -containing mica film with a weight of 160 g/m2 consisting of a mixture of uncalcined<br>
muscovite or phlogopite and 5% by weight alkali-free E-glass short fibers which have a<br>
diameter of on average 8 microns and a fiber length of roughly 3 mm is preimpregnated with<br>
a solution of an epoxy resin mixture in methylethyl ketone After the solvent is evaporated,<br>
roughly 4 g/m2 epoxy resin remain in the fiber-containing mica film. This measure prevents<br>
detachment of the mica flakes during subsequent processing so that the fiber-containing<br>
mica film is more resistant to medicine.<br>
The mica film which has been promoted and this is sprinkled with bordered<br>
epoxy resin mixture with a softening point &gt;85o.C. The fiber-containing mica film which has<br>
been sprinkled in this way is then cemented to the carrier material by means of a heatable<br>
calender under pressure and the action of heat.<br>
The following can be used as the carrier material:<br>
a) a glass fabric with a mass per unit area of 23 g/m2 which is coated with 2 g/m2 of a<br>
flexibly cross-linking acrylic resin which is temperature treated in an oven at 100°C for curing,<br>
or<br>
b) a polyester formed fabric with a mass per unit area of 20 g/m2, or<br>
c) a polyester film with a mass per unit area of 42 g/m2.<br>
The advantages of a mica-containing insulating tape produced using the process as claimed<br>
in the invention can be represented very effectively using the number of impregnated layers<br>
during vacuum pressure impregnation compared to known mica-containing insulating tapes.<br>
For this reason profile rods are wound with 20 layers each of the mica-containing insulating<br>
tape half-overlapped, the end faces of the insulation are sealed with resin and the model<br>
rods which have been produced a winding element in the<br>
form of a conductor rod are imbredmated with a silvent-free epoxy acid anhydride<br>
impregnation resin at 60°C for three hours.<br>
After curing, the model rods are cut crosswise to be able to measure the nation depth.<br>
In this way a mica-containing insulating tape produced using the process as described and<br>
as shown in Example 1 (sample A) or a known mica-containing insulating tape with a<br>
comparable structure, but without adding fibers (sample B), are used.<br>
The results are shown in the diagrams in Figures 1 and 2 of the accompanying drawings.<br>
The diagram in Figure 1 shows that when using the mica-containing insulating tape A which<br>
has been produced in accordance with the present invention, the insulation thickness, i. e.<br>
the thickness of the 20 layers, is impregnated overall. But, in known insulating tapes B,<br>
without adding fibers, only roughly two thirds of the insulation thickness are impregnated;<br>
this necessarily results in cavities between the individual layers which lead to partial<br>
discharges and thus to failure of the insulating system.<br>
In another test, profile rods are wound with 10 layers each of mica-containing insulating tape<br>
half-overlapped, the end faces of the insulation are sealed with resin so that model rods<br>
which simulate a winding element in the form of a conductor bar are produced. Mica-<br>
containing insulating tapes can be which has been produced as shown in<br>
Example 1 of the process of the invention insulating tape as in the<br>
prior art (sample B), but without the fiber adope.<br>
Then the cured model rods which have been provided with sample A or stable B are<br>
subjected to a thermal aging cycle, one cycle meaning the heating of the rods 55oC over<br>
16 hours and subsequent cooling to room temperature. After each cycle the loss tangent<br>
value (tan d) is measured as a function of the voltage. The resulting maximum increase<br>
(tan d max) reproduces the optical and mechanical state of the insulation after each cycle.<br>
Higher increase values mean earlier "rising" of the insulation which subsequently leads to<br>
electrical breakdown and thus to failure of the insulation.<br>
In the diagram shown in Figure 2 the number of thermal aging cycles is plotted against the<br>
maximum loss tangent increase (tan d max in %).<br>
This indicates that the mica-containing insulating tape without the addition of fibers (sample<br>
B) after a few aging cycles has a higher maximum loss tangent increase than sample A<br>
which is shown for comparison and which was produced using the process of the invention;<br>
this also makes it possible to draw conclusions about very rapid delamination of the<br>
insulation.<br>
Commercial applicability<br>
Fiber-containing and mica-containing Mutating tapes as are produced in with<br>
the present invention, when used in form of winding elements such as conductor rods,<br>
show extremely satisfactory long-term several thermal and<br>
