				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to a composition for the manufacture of flyash based rigid sheet useful as an alternative for asbestos sheet. The present invention particularly provides asbestos free composition for the manufacture of rigid sheets. The asbestos free composition of the present invention more particularly provides flyash, an industrial waste product, based binder compositions made from unsaturated resins and natural fibrous material, such as agricultural waste like paddy rind or straw for manufacturing of rigid sheets useful as an alternative for asbestos sheets.<br>
The flyash, an industrial waste product, based rigid sheet manufactured from the composition of the present invention will find wide spread use as an alternative to asbestos sheet in particular and as an alternative to roofing sheets such as asbestos sheets, corrugated tin sheets in general.<br>
Asbestos sheet of cement is widely used as roof covering, specially as roofing material of in rural areas. The cement asbestos sheet poses a potential health hazard and hence, is not a recommended material. Corrugated-iron sheet is also used as roof covering, but this sheet is uncomfortable in summer and cold seasons.<br>
Further, the drawbacks of asbestos are given below:<br>
Inhalation of the fine asbestos dust may cause the disease known as "asbestosis", which is a scarring of the lung tissues. Asbestos fibers, if they become airborne and are inhaled can be hazardous to health. Therefore, to remove the risk of health hazard, the product made the use of asbestos in construction products virtually impossible as per government regulations during 1980s and early 1990s. Reference may be made to the website: www.professionalroofinq.net/past/oct2000/tech.asp. This brought about the search for substitutes of asbestos fibres used in fibres cement roofing products.<br>
Reference may be made to: Northern Territory, work Health Authority and series Work Health Information Bulletin; Bui 66 , website:<br>
www.nohsc.gov.au/OHSInformation/Databases/PracticalGuidanceMaterial/w/003 598.htm .regarding working with asbestos cement (A-C) sheet.<br>
Further reference may be made to: Tasmania: Department of Employment, Industrial  Relations  and  Training.  Occupational  Health  and  Safety  branch (www.nohsc.qov.au/OHSInformation/Databases/PracticalGuidancelvlaterial/0028 OO.htm) regarding asbestos-health precautions.<br>
Regulation concerning the use of asbestos in work places generally issued in industrial safety, health and welfare (Administrative General) regulation 1979: Inhalation of the fine asbestos dust may cause the disease known as asbestosis, which is a scarring of the lung tissues. Cancer in other body sites have been attributed to asbestos dust. An uncommon form of cancer (methothelima) may occur in the chest or abdomen due to inhalation of asbestos dust over a long period.<br>
Reference may be made to technical report "Development of a pilot scale commercial facility for fabrication and marketing of light weight coal combination by products based artificial support for mine use" Chugh et al, Southern Illinois University at Carbonate, USA (1996). The work on the utilization of flyash as support material in laboratory provides a non-polymerized material product. The support was prepared with the help of cement, thus the product has brittleness.<br>
Reference may be made to the proceedings of "International conference of flyash disposal &amp; utilization, 20-22 January 1998", for making flyash bricks by using flyash, lime, gypsum, sand and water.<br>
Further reference may be made to ACI Mater, M48, 1991, V. M. Malhotra, G. G. Carette and A. Bilodean, wherein use has been made of polypropylene fibers with flyash. The strength of the product is found to be low.<br>
Reference may be made to an US Patent No. 4,011,195 dated March 8, 1977 entitled " Polymerizable compositions containing unsaturated polymer resins and aqueous alkali metal silicate, method of preparing shaped articles form such compositions and thermoset products thereof wherein polymerizable unsaturated polyester resin syrup can be extended with aqueous alkali metal silicate in compositions. The compositions further can be extended; a) by the addition of reactive fillers such as metal oxides or hydrated metallic salts; b) by the addition of inertfiller such as clay, silica glass-fibers, perlite and c) by the addition of both a) and b). The composition can be employed in coatings, laminates, cast articles, molded articles and other shaped articles. The polymerized products are resistant to combustion have low fuel content, low flame spread and are useful thermal insulating materials. The products furthermore have a low smoke content. When exposed to fire, the organic content of these materials is burned and the residual inorganic content is converted to refractory ceramic material, which resists further thermal deterioration and functions as a thermal insulator to resist thermal transfer. The drawback is that use has been made of inorganic compounds such as SiC&gt;2 There is no use of flyash and natural fiber for changing the molecular structure of the unsaturated polyester resin.<br>
Reference may be made to an US Patent No. 5, 439, 578 dated August 8, 1995 titled "Flyash based composition" wherein a composition of lime containing flyash with water has been described. The developed compositions are only provided for floor underlayment, road patch and exterior statuary applications.<br>
Reference may be made to an US patent No. 5, 852, 077 dated December 22, 1998 titled "lightweight, waterproof, insulating, cementitious compositions and<br>
methods for forming and using such compositions" wherein noncementitious filler, Portland cement, bentonite, diatomaceous earth and lime have used as composition. The noncementatious filler may be sawdust, rubber chips, flyash or combinations of two or more of these ingredients. The developed product may be used for electrically nonconductive posts and can be used to absorb and contain liquid contaminants in a vessel.<br>
Reference may be made to an US Patent No. 6,485,561 dated Nov. 26, 2002 titled "Low density cellular concrete with accelerators for rapid hardening" wherein a composition have been described and claimed. The composition of the above patent was cement, water, a surfactant to create foam and an accelerator such as sodium carbonate. An additional embodiment includes using a byproduct such as flyash in the composition to further reduce costs and make an environmentally product.<br>
The drawbacks of the prior art as referred above are that the end-products are for use in the field of floor underlayment, road patch, exterior statuary applications and electrically non-conductive ports. In all the above prior art the authors were using flyash with cement in the compositions. These compositions may also increase the density of the products.<br>
Reference may be made to an US Patent No. 6,596,789 dated August July 22, 2003 titled "Non-asbestos friction materials" wherein a composition has been described and claimed. The developed composition was suitable for disc pads, brake linings, clutch facings and the like in automobiles, heavy duty trucks, railroad cars, and various types of industrial equipment.<br>
Disposal of flyash generated from thermal power plants is a great problem. The dispersion of flyash in environment leads to pollution and increasing health hazards to human, animals and decreasing the fertility of nearby agriculture land.<br>
The constructive use of industrial waste materials like flyash and agricultural waste such as paddy rind and straw will help to reduce environmental pollution.<br>
Thus, there is a definite requirement to develop asbestos free roof covering sheet for rural areas with the help of waste material like flyash, paddy rind and straw with polymer having high compressive and tensile strength and good shelf life. This will solve the ground control problem and also facilitate flyash disposal.<br>
The main object of the present invention to provide a composition for the manufacture of flyash based rigid sheet useful as an alternative for asbestos sheet, which obviates the above noted drawbacks.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a composition for the manufacture of asbestos free flyash based sheet suitable for rural development such as roof covering.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide an asbestos free composition for the manufacture of rigid asbestos free sheet other than cement asbestos sheet, which are suitable for use as alternative of cement asbestos sheet for using in rural areas.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to provide a composition, which primarily consists of flyash, an industrial waste product and agricultural waste such as paddy rind or straw.<br>
A further object of the present invention is to provide a composition for the manufacture of flyash based rigid sheet which is not a health hazard.<br>
A still further object of the present invention is to provide a composition for the manufacture of flyash based rigid sheet which has no moisture and does not have rusting effect.<br>
The present invention provides a novel composition for the manufacture of flyash based rigid sheets useful as an alternative for asbestos sheets which poses potential health hazard. The asbestos free synergistic composition consists of flyash, an industrial waste product, natural fibrous material, such as agricultural waste like paddy rind or straw, and unsaturated resins.
