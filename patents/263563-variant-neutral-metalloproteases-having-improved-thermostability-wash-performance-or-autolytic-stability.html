				<td>USE AND PRODUCTION OF STORAGE-STABLE NEUTRAL METALLOPROTEASE<br>
The present application claims priority to pending U.S. Provisional Patent Application Serial No. 60/726,448, filed October 12,2005.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides methods and compositions comprising at least one neutral metalloprotease enzyme that has improved storage stability. In some embodiments, the neutral metalloprotease finds use in cleaning and other applications. In some particularly preferred embodiments, the present invention provides methods and compositions comprising neutral metalloprotease(s) obtained from Bacillus sp. In some more particularly preferred embodiments, the neutral metalloprotease is obtained from B. amyloliquefaci0ens. In still further preferred embodiments, the neutral metalloprotease is a variant of the B. amyloliquefaaeiisneulral metalloprotease. In yet additional embodiments, the neutral metalloprotease is a homolog of the the B. omyloliquefociens neutral metalloprotease. The present invention finds particular use in applications including, but not limited to cleaning, bleaching and disinfecting.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Detergent and other cleaning compositions typically include a complex combination of active ingredients. For example, most cleaning products include a surfactant system, enzymes for cleaning, bleaching agents, builders, suds suppressors, soil-suspending agents, soil-release agents, optical brighteners, softening agents, dispersants, dye transfer inhibition<br>
compounds, abrasives, bactericides, and perfumes. Despite the complexity of current detergents, there are many stains that are difficult to completely remove. Furthermore, there is often residue build-up, which results in discoloration (e.g., yellowing) and diminished aesthetics due to incomplete cleaning. These problems are compounded by the increased use of low (e.g., cold water) wash temperatures and shorter washing cycles. Moreover, many stains are composed of complex mixtures of fibrous material, mainly incorporating carbohydrates and carbohydrate derivatives, fiber, and cell wall components (e.g., plajit material, wood, mud/clay based soil, and fruit). These stains present difficult challenges to the formulation and use of cleaning compositions.<br>
In addition, colored garments tend to wear and show appearance losses. A portion of this color loss is due to abrasion in the laundering process, particularly in automated washing and drying machines. Moreover, tensile strength loss of fabric appears to be an unavoidable result of mechanical and chemical action due to use, wearing, and/or washing and drying. Thus, a means to efficiently and effectively wash colored garments so that these appearance losses are minimized is needed.<br>
In sum, despite improvements in the capabilities of cleaning compositions, there remains a need in the art for detergents that remove stains, maintain fabric color and appearance, and prevent dye transfer. In addition, there remains a need for detergent and/or fabric care compositions that provide and/or restore tensile strength, as well as provide anti-wrinkle, anti-bobbling, and/or anti-shrinkage properties to fabrics, as well as provide static control, fabric softness, maintain the desired color appearance, and fabric anti-wear properties and benefits. In particular, there remains a need for the inclusion of compositions that are capable of removing the colored components of stains, which often remain attached to the fabric being laundered. In addition, there remains a need for improved methods and compositions suitable for textile bleaching.<br>

Indeed, it is contemplated that enzymes having various degrees of stability in one or more of these characteristics (pH, temperature, proteolytic stability, detergent stability, and/or oxidative stability) will find use.<br>
As used herein, "expression vector" refers to a DNA construct containing a DNA sequence that is operably linked to a suitable control sequence capable of effecting the expression of the DNA in a suitable host. Such control sequences include a promoter to effect transcription, an optional operator sequence to control such transcription, a sequence encoding suitable mRNA ribosome binding sites and sequences which control termination of transcription and translation. The vector may be a plasmid, a phage panicle, or simply a potential genomic insert. Once transformed into a suitable host, the vector may replicate and<br>
function independently of the host genome, or may, in some instances, integrate into the genome itself. In the present specification, "plasmid," "expression plasmid," and "vector" are often used interchangeably as the plasmid is the most commonly used form of vector at present. However, the invention is intended to include such other forms of expression vectors that serve equivalent functions and which are, or become, known in the art.<br>
In some preferred embodiments, the neutral metalloprotease gene is ligated into an appropriate expression plasmid. The cloned neutral metalloprotease gene is then used to transform or transfect a host cell in order to express the neutral metalloprotease gene. This plasmid may replicate in hosts in the sense that it contains the well-known elements necessary for plasmid replication or the plasmid may be designed to integrate into the host chromosome. The necessary elements are provided for efficient gene expression (e.g., a promoter operably linked to the gene of interest). In some embodiments, these necessary elements are supplied as the gene's own homologous promoter if it is recognized, (i.e., transcribed, by the host), a transcription terminator (a polyadenylation region for eukaryotic host cells) which is exogenous or is supplied by the endogenous terminator region of the neutral metalloprotease gene. In some embodiments, a selection gene such as an antibiotic resistance gene that enables continuous cultural maintenance of plasmid-infected host cells by growth in antimicrobial-containing media is also included.<br>
The following cassette mutagenesis method may be used to facilitate the construction of the neutral metalloprotease variants of the present invention, although other methods may be used. First, as described herein, a naturally-occurring gene encoding the neutral metalloprotease is obtained and sequenced in whole or in part. Then, the sequence is scanned for a point at which it is desired to make a mutation (deletion, insertion or substitution) of one or more amino acids in the encoded neutral metalloprotease. The sequences flanking this point are evaluated for the presence of restriction sites for replacing a short segment of the gene with an oligonucleotide pool which when expressed will encode various mutants. Such restriction sites are preferably unique sites within the protein gene so as to facilitate the replacement of the gene segment. However, any convenient restriction site which is not overly redundant in the neutral metalloprotease gene may be used, provided the gene fragments generated by restriction digestion can be reassembled in proper sequence. If restriction sites are not present at locations within a convenient distance from the selected point (from 10 to 15 nucleotides), such sites are generated by substituting nucleotides in the<br>
gene in such a fashion that neither the reading frame nor the amino acids encoded are changed in the final construction. Mutation of the gene in order to change its sequence to conform to the desired sequence is accomplished by M13 primer extension in accord with generally known methods. The task of locating suitable flanking regions and evaluating the needed changes to arrive at two convenient restriction site sequences is made routine by the redundancy of the genetic code, a restriction enzyme map of the gene and the large number of different.restriction enzymes. Note that if a convenient flanking restriction site is available, the above method need be used only in connection with the flanking region which does not contain a site.<br>
Once the naturally-occurring DNA and/or synthetic DNA is cloned, the restriction sites flanking the positions to be mutated are digested with the cognate restriction enzymes and a plurality of end termini-complementary oligonucleotide cassettes are ligated into the gene. The mutagenesis is simplified by this method because all of the oligonucleotides can be synthesized so as to have the same restriction sites, and no synthetic linkers are necessary to create the restriction sites.<br>
As used herein, "corresponding to," refers to a residue at the enumerated position in a protein or peptide, or a residue that is analogous, homologous, or equivalent to an enumerated residue in a protein or peptide.<br>
As used herein, "corresponding region," generally refers to an analogous position along related proteins or a parent protein.<br>
The terms "nucleic acid molecule encoding," "nucleic acid sequence encoding," "DNA sequence encoding," and "DNA encoding" refer to the order or sequence of deoxyribonucleotides along a strand of deoxyribonucleic acid. The order of these deoxyribonucleotides determines the order of amino acids along the polypeptide (protein) chain. The DNA sequence thus codes for the amino acid sequence.<br>
As used herein, the term "analogous sequence" refers to a sequence within a protein that provides similar function, tertiary structure, and/or conserved residues as the protein of interest (i,e., typically the original protein of interest). For example, in epitope regions that contain an alpha helix or a beta sheet structure, the replacement amino acids in the analogous sequence preferably maintain the same specific structure. The term also refers to nucleotide sequences, as well as amino acid sequences. In some embodiments, analogous sequences are developed such that the replacement amino acids result in a variant enzyme showing a similar<br>
or improved function. In some preferred embodiments, the tertiary structure and/or conserved residues of the amino acids in the protein of interest are located at or near the segment or fragment of interest. Thus, where the segment or fragment of interest contains, for example, an alpha-helix or a beta-sheet structure, the replacement amino acids preferably maintain that specific structure.<br>
As used herein, "homologous protein" refers to a protein (e.g., neutral metalloprotease) that has similar action and/or structure, as a protein of interest (e.g., an neutral metalloprotease from another source). It is not intended that homologs (also referred to herein as "homologues") be necessarily related evolutionarily. Thus, it is intended that the term encompass the same or similar enzyme(s) (Le., in terms of structure and function) obtained from different species. In some preferred embodiments, it is desirable to identify a homolog that has a quaternary, tertiary and/or primary structure similar to the protein of interest, as replacement for the segment or fragment in the protein of interest with an analogous segment from the homolog will reduce the disruptiveness of the change.<br>
As used herein, "homologous genes" refers to at least a pair of genes from different species, which genes correspond to each other and which are identical or very similar to each other. The term encompasses genes that are separated by speciation (Le., the development of new species) (e.g., orthologous genes), as well as genes that have been separated by genetic duplication (e.g., paralogous genes). These genes encode "homologous proteins."<br>
As used herein, "ortholog" and "orthologous genes" refer to genes in different species that have evolved from a common ancestral gene (Le., a homologous gene) by speciation. Typically, orthologs retain the same function during the course of evolution. Identification of orthologs finds use in the reliable prediction of gene function in newly sequenced genomes.<br>
As used herein, "paralog" and "paralogous genes" refer to genes that are related by duplication within a genome. While orthologs retain the same function through the course of evolution, paralogs evolve new functions, even though some functions are often related to the original one. Examples of paralogous genes include, but are not limited to genes encoding trypsin, chymotrypsin, elastase, and thrombin, which are all serine proteinases and occur together within the same species.<br>
As used herein, "wild-type" and "native" proteins are those found in nature. The terms "wild-type sequence," and "wild-type gene" are used interchangeably herein, to refer to<br>
a sequence that is native or naturally occurring in a host cell. In .some embodiments, the wild-type sequence refers to a sequence of interest that is the starting point of a protein engineering project. The genes encoding the naturally-occurring protein may be obtained in accord with the general methods known to those skilled in the art. The methods generally comprise synthesizing labeled probes having putative sequences encoding regions of the protein of interest, preparing genomic libraries from organisms expressing the protein, and screening the libraries for the gene of interest by hybridization to the probes. Positively hybridizing clones are then mapped and sequenced.<br>
The term "recombinant DNA molecule" as used herein refers to a DNA molecule that is comprised of segments of DNA joined together by means of molecular biological techniques.<br>
The term "recombinant oligonucleotide" refers to an oligonucleotide created using molecular biological manipulations, including but not limited to, the ligation of two or more oligonucleotide sequences generated by restriction enzyme digestion of a polynucleotide sequence, the synthesis of oligonucleotides (e.g., the synthesis of primers or oligonucleotides) and the like.<br>
The degree of homology between sequences may be determined using any suitable method known in the art (See e.g., Smith and Waterman, Adv. Appl. Math., 2:482 [1981]; Needleman and Wunsch, J. Mol. Biol., 48:443 [1970]; Pearson and Lipman, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85:2444 [1988]; programs such as GAP, BESTFTT, FASTA, and TFASTA in the Wisconsin Genetics Software Package (Genetics Computer Group, Madison, WJ); and Devereux et al., Nucl. Acid Res., 12:387-395 [1984]).<br>
For example, PflJEUP is a useful program to determine sequence homology levels. PILEUP creates a multiple sequence alignment from a group of related sequences using progressive, pairwise alignments. It can also plot a tree showing the clustering relationships used to create the alignment. PILEUP uses a simplification of the progressive alignment method of Feng and Doolittle, (Feng and Doolittle, J. Mol. Evol., 35:351-360 [1987]). The method is similar to that described by Higgins and Sharp (Higgins and Sharp, CABIOS 5:151-153 [1989]). Useful PILEUP parameters including a default gap weight of 3.00, a default gap length weight of 0.10, and weighted end gaps. Another example of a useful algorithm is the BLAST algorithm, described by Altschul et al., (Altschul et al., J. Mol. Biol., 215:403-41.0, [1990]; and Karlin et.al* Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90:5873-5787 [1993]).<br>
One particularly useful BLAST program is the WU-BLAST-2 program (See, Altschul el al., Meth. Enzymo).,, 266:460-480 [1996]). parameters "W," "T," and "X" determine the sensitivity and speed of the alignment. The BLAST program uses as defaults a wordlength (W) of 11, the BLOSUM62 scoring matrix (See, Henikoff and Henikoff, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89:10915 [1989]) alignments (B) of 50, expectation (E) of 10, M'5, N'-4, and a comparison of both strands.<br>
As used herein, "percent (%) nucleic acid sequence identity" is defined as the percentage of nucleotide residues in a candidate sequence that is identical with the nucleotide residues of the sequence.<br>
As used herein, the term "hybridization" refers to the process by which a strand of nucleic acid joins with a complementary strand through base pairing, as known in the art.<br>
As used herein, the phrase "hybridization conditions" refers to the conditions under which hybridization reactions are conducted. These conditions are typically classified by degree of "stringency" of the conditions under which hybridization is measured. The degree of stringency can be based, for example, on the melting temperature (Tm) of the nucleic acid binding complex or probe. For example, "maximum stringency" typically occurs at about Tm-5°C (5° below the Tm of the probe); "high stringency" at about 5-10° below the Tm; "intermediate stringency" at about 10-20° below the Tm of the probe; and "low stringency" at about 20-25° below the Tm. Alternatively, or in addition, hybridization conditions can be based upon the salt or ionic strength conditions of hybridization and/or one or more stringency washes. For example, 6xSSC = very low stringency; 3xSSC = low to medium stringency; IxSSC = medium stringency; and 0.5xSSC = high stringency. Functionally, maximum stringency conditions may be used to identify nucleic acid sequences having strict identity or near-strict identity with the hybridization probe; while high stringency conditions are used to identify nucleic acid sequences having about 80% or more sequence identity with the probe.<br>
For applications requiring high selectivity, it is typically desirable to use relatively stringent conditions to form the hybrids (e.g., relatively low salt and/or high temperature conditions are used).<br>
The phrases "substantially similar and "substantially identical" in the context of at least two nucleic acids or polypeptides typically means that a polynucleotide or polypeptide<br>
comprises a sequence that has at least about 40% identity, more preferable at least about 50% identity, yet more preferably at least about 60% identity, preferably at least about 75% identity, more preferably at least about 80% identity, yet more preferably at least about 90%, still more preferably about 95%, most preferably about 97% identity, sometimes as much as about 98% and about 99% sequence identity, compared to the reference (i.e., wild-type) sequence. Sequence identity may be determined using known programs such as BLAST, ALIGN, and CLUSTAL using standard parameters. (See e.g., Altschul, et al., J. Mol. Biol. 215:403-410 [1990]; Henikoff et al, Proc. Nad. Acad. Sci. USA 89:10915 [1989]; Karin et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci USA 90:5873 [1993]; and Higgins et al, Gene 73:237 - 244 [1988]). Software for performing BLAST analyses is publicly available through the National Center for Biotechnology Information. Also, databases may be searched using FASTA (Pearson et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85:2444-2448 [1988]). One indication that two polypeptides are substantially identical is that the first polypeptide is immunologically cross-reactive with the second polypeptide. Typically, polypeptides that differ by conservative amino acid substitutions are immunologically cross-reactive. Thus, a polypeptide is substantially identical to a second polypeptide, for example, where the two peptides differ only by a conservative substitution. Another indication that two nucleic acid sequences are substantially identical is that the two molecules hybridize to each other under stringent conditions (e.g., within a range of medium to high stringency).<br>
As used herein, "equivalent residues" refers to proteins that share particular amino acid residues. For example, equivalent resides may be identified by determining homology at the level of tertiary structure for a protein (e.g., neutral metalloprotease) whose tertiary structure has been determined by x-ray crystallography. Equivalent residues are defined as those for which the atomic coordinates of two or more of the main chain atoms of a particular amino acid residue of the protein having putative equivalent residues and the protein of interest (N on N, CA on CA, C on C and O on O) are within 0.13 nm and preferably 0.1 nm after alignment. Alignment is achieved after the best model has been oriented and positioned to give the maximum overlap of atomic coordinates of non-hydrogen protein atoms of the proteins analyzed. The preferred model is the crystallographic model giving the lowest R factor for experimental diffraction data at the highest resolution available, determined using methods known to those skilled in the art of crystallography and protein characterization/analysis.<br>
As used herein, the terms "hybrid neutral metalloproteases" and "fusion neutral metalloproteases" refer to proteins that are engineered from at least two different or "parental" proteins. In preferred embodiments, these parental proteins are homologs of one another. For example, in some embodiments, a preferred hybrid neutral metalloprotease or fusion protein contains the N-terminus of a protein and the C-terminus of a homolog of the protein. In some preferred embodiment, the two terminal ends are combined to correspond to the full-length active protein.<br>
The term "regulatory element" as used herein refers to a genetic element that controls some aspect of the expression of nucleic acid sequences. For example, a promoter is a regulatory element which facilitates the initiation of transcription of an operably linked coding region. Additional regulatory elements include splicing signals, polyadenylation signals and termination signals.<br>
As used herein, "host cells" are generally prokaryotic or eukaryotic hosts which are transformed or transfected with vectors constructed using recombinant DNA techniques known in the art. Transformed host cells are capable of either replicating vectors encoding the protein variants or expressing the desired protein variant. In the case of vectors which encode the pre- or prepro-form of the protein variant, such variants, when expressed, are typically secreted from the host cell into the host cell medium.<br>
The term "introduced" in the context of inserting a nucleic acid sequence into a cell, means transformation, transduction or transfection. Means of transformation include protoplast transformation, calcium chloride precipitation, electro oration, naked DNA and the like as known in the art. (See, Chang and Cohen, Mol. Gen. Genet., 168:111 -115 [1979]; Smith el al., Appl. Env. Microbiol., 51:634 [1986]; and the review article by Ferrari et al., in Harwood, Bacillus. Plenum Publishing Corporation, pp. 57-72 [1989]).<br>
The term "promoter/enhancer" denotes a segment of DNA which contains sequences capable of providing both promoter and enhancer functions (for example, the long terminal repeats of retroviruses contain both promoter and enhancer functions). The enhancer/promoter may be "endogenous" or "exogenous" or "heterologous." An endogenous enhancer/promoter is one which is naturally linked with a given gene in the genome. An exogenous (heterologous) enhancer/promoter is one which is placed in juxtaposition to a gene by means of genetic manipulation (i.e., molecular biological techniques).<br>
The presence of "splicing signals" on an expression vector often results in higher levels of expression of the recombinant transcript. Splicing signals mediate the removal of introns from the primary RNA transcript and consist of a splice donor and acceptor site (Sarnbrook et al, Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York [1989], pp. 16.7-16.8). A commonly used splice donor and acceptor site is the splice junction from the 16S RNA of SV40.<br>
The term "stable transfection" or "stably transfected" refers to the introduction and integration of foreign DNA into the genome of the transfected cell. The term "stable transfectant" refers to a cell which has stably integrated foreign or exogenous DNA into the genomic DNA of the transfected cell.<br>
The terms "selectable marker" or "selectable gene product" as used herein refer to the use of a gene which encodes an enzymatic activity that confers resistance to an antibiotic or drug upon the cell in which the selectable marker is expressed.<br>
As used herein, the terms "amplification" and "gene amplification" refer to a process by which specific DNA sequences are disproportionately replicated such that the amplified gene becomes present in a higher copy number than was initially present in the genome. In some embodiments, selection of cells by growth in the presence of a drug (e.g., an inhibitor of an inhibitable enzyme) results in the amplification of either the endogenous gene encoding the gene product required for growth in the presence of the drug or by amplification of exogenous (i.e., input) sequences encoding this gene product, or both. Selection of cells by growth in the presence of a drug (e.g., an inhibitor of an inhibitable enzyme) may result in the amplification of either the endogenous gene encoding the gene product required for growth in the presence of the drug or by amplification of exogenous (i.e., input) sequences encoding this gene product, or both.<br>
"Amplification" is a special case of nucleic acid replication involving template specificity. It is to be contrasted with non-specific template replication (i.e., replication that is template-dependent but not dependent on a specific template). Template specificity is here distinguished from fidelity of replication (i.e., synthesis of the proper polynucleotide sequence) and nucleotide (ribo- or deoxyribo-) specificity. Template specificity is frequently described in terms of "target" specificity. Target sequences are "targets" in the sense that they are sought to be sorted out from other nucleic acid. Amplification techniques have been designed primarily for this sorting out.<br>
As used herein, the terra "co-amplification" refers to the introduction into a single cell of an amplifiable marker in conjunction with other gene sequences (i.e., comprising one or more non-selectable genes such as those contained within an expression vector) and the application of appropriate selective pressure such that the cell amplifies both the amplifiable marker and the other, non-selectable gene sequences. The amplifiable marker may be physically linked to the other gene sequences or alternatively two separate pieces of DNA, one containing the amplifiable marker and the other containing the non-selectable marker, may be introduced into the same cell.<br>
As used herein, the terms "amplifiable marker," "amplifiable gene," and "amplification vector" refer to a marker, gene or a vector encoding a gene which permits the amplification of that gene under appropriate growth conditions.<br>
As used herein, the term "amplifiable nucleic acid" refers to nucleic acids which may be amplified by any amplification method. It is contemplated that "amplifiable nucleic acid" will usually comprise "sample template."<br>
As used herein, the term "sample template" refers to nucleic acid originating from a sample which is analyzed for the presence of "target" (defined below). In contrast, "background template" is used in reference to nucleic acid other than sample template which may or may not be present in a sample. Background template is most often inadvertent. It may be the result of carryover, or it may be due to the presence of nucleic acid contaminants sought to be purified away from the sample. For example, nucleic acids from organisms other than those to be detected may be present as background in a test sample.<br>
'Template specificity" is achieved in most amplification techniques by the choice of enzyme. Amplification enzymes are enzymes that, under conditions they are used, will process only specific sequences of nucleic acid in a heterogeneous mixture of nucleic acid. For example, in the case of Qp replicase, MDV-1 RNA is the specific template for the replicase (See e.g., Kacian el al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 69:3038 [1972]). Other nucleic acids are not replicated by this amplification enzyme. Similarly, in the case of T7 RNA polymerase, this amplification enzyme has a stringent specificity for its own promoters (See, Chamberlin et al, Nature 228:227 [1970]). In the case of T4 DNA ligase, the enzyme will not ligate the two oligonucleotides or polynucleotides, where there is a mismatch between the oligonucleotide or polynucleotide substrate and the template at the ligation junction (See, Wu and Wallace, Genomics 4:560 [1989]). Finally, Taq and Pfu polymerases, by virtue of their<br>
ability to function at high temperature, are found to display high specificity for the sequences bounded and thus defined by the primers; the high temperature results in thermodynamic conditions that favor primer hybridization with the target sequences and not hybridization with non-target sequences.<br>
As used herein, the terra "primer" refers to an oligonucleotide, whether occurring naturally as in a purified restriction digest or produced synthetically, which is capable of acting as a point of initiation of synthesis when placed under conditions in which synthesis of a primer extension product which is complementary to a nucleic acid strand is induced, (i.e., in the presence of nudeotides and an inducing agent such as DNA polymerase and at a suitable temperature and pH). The primer is preferably single stranded for maximum efficiency in amplification, but may alternatively be double stranded. If double stranded, the primer is first treated to separate its strands before being used to prepare extension products. Preferably, the primer is an oligodeoxyribonucleotide. The primer must be sufficiently long to prime the synthesis of extension products in the presence of the inducing agent. The exact lengths of the primers will depend on many factors, including temperature, source of primer and the use of the method.<br>
As used herein, the term "probe" refers to an oligonucleotide (i.e., a sequence of nucleotides), whether occurring naturally as in a purified restriction digest or produced synthetically, recombinantly or by PCR amplification, which is capable of hybridizing to another oligonucleotide of interest. A probe may be single-stranded or double-stranded. Probes are useful in the detection, identification and isolation of particular gene sequences. It is contemplated that any probe used in the present invention will be labeled with any "reporter molecule," so that is detectable in any detection system, including, but not limited to enzyme (e.g., EL1SA, as well as enzyme-based histochemical assays), fluorescent, radioactive, and luminescent systems. It is not intended that the present invention be limited to any particular detection system or label.<br>
As used herein, the term "target," when used in reference to amplification methods (e.g., the polymerase chain reaction), refers to the region of nucleic acid bounded by the primers used for polymerase chain reaction. Thus, the "target" is sought to be sorted out from other nucleic acid sequences. A "segment" is defined as a region of nucleic acid within the target sequence.<br>
As used herein, the term "polymerase chain reaction" ("PCR") refers to the methods of U.S. Patent Nos. 4,683,195,4,683,202, and 4,965,188, hereby incorporated by reference, which include methods for increasing the concentration of a segment of a target sequence in a mixture of genomic DNA without cloning or purification. This process for amplifying the target sequence consists of introducing a large excess of two oligonucleotide primers to the DNA mixture containing the desired target sequence, followed by a precise sequence of thermal cycling in the presence of a DNA polymerase. The two primers are complementary to their respective strands of the double stranded target sequence. To effect amplification, the mixture is denatured and the primers then annealed to their complementary sequences within the target molecule. Following annealing, the primers are extended with a polymerase so as to form a new pair of complementary strands. The steps of denaturation, primer annealing and polymerase extension can be repeated many times (i.e., denaturation, annealing and extension constitute one "cycle"; there can be numerous "cycles") to obtain a high concentration of an amplified segment of the desired target sequence. The length of the    • amplified segment of the desired target sequence is determined by the relative positions of the primers with respect to each other, and therefore, this length is a controllable parameter. By virtue of the repeating aspect of the process, the method is referred to as the "polymerase chain reaction" (hereinafter "PCR"). Because the desired amplified segments of the target sequence become the predominant sequences (in terms of concentration) in the mixture, they are said to be "PCR amplified".<br>
As used herein, the term "amplification reagents" refers to those reagents (deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates, buffer, etc.), needed for amplification except for primers, nucleic acid template and the amplification enzyme. Typically, amplification reagents along with other reaction components are placed and contained in a reaction vessel (test tube, microwell, etc.).<br>
With PCR, it is possible to amplify a single copy of a specific target sequence in genomic DNA to a level detectable by several different methodologies (e.g., hybridization with a labeled probe; incorporation of biotinylated primers followed by avidin-enzyme conjugate detection; incorporation of 32P-labeled deoxynucleotide triphosphates, such as dCTP or dATP, into the amplified segment). In addition to genomic DNA, any oligonucleotide or polynucleotide sequence can be amplified with the appropriate set of<br>
primer molecules. In particular, the amplified segments created by the PCR process itself are, themselves, efficient templates for subsequent PCR amplifications.<br>
As used herein, the terms "PCR product," "PCR fragment," and "amplification product" refer to the resultant mixture of compounds after two or more cycles of the PCR steps of denaturation, annealing and extension are complete. These terms encompass the case where there has been amplification of one or more segments of one or more target sequences.<br>
As used herein, the terms "restriction endonucleases" and "restriction enzymes" refer to bacterial enzymes, each of which cut double-stranded DNA at or near a specific nucleotide sequence.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PRESENT INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides methods and compositions comprising at least one neutral metalloprotease enzyme that has improved storage stability. In some embodiments, the neutral metalloprotease finds use in cleaning and other applications. In some particularly preferred embodiments, the present invention provides methods and compositions comprising neutral metal!oprotease(s) obtained from Bacillus sp. In some more particularly preferred embodiments, the neutral metal!oprotease is obtained from B. amyloliquefaciens. In still further preferred embodiments, the neutral metalloprotease is &amp; variant of the B. amyloliquefaciens neutral metalloprotease. In yet additional embodiments, the neutral metalloprotease is a homoJog of the the 5. amyloliquefaciens neutral metalloprotease. The present invention finds particular use in applications including, but not limited to cleaning, bleaching and disinfecting.<br>
Also as described in more detail in the Examples below, the present invention provides many advantages for cleaning of a wide range of objects, including but not limited to clothing, fabrics, medical devices; etc. In addition, the present invention provides compositions that are effective in.cleaning, bleaching, and disinfecting, over a range of wash temperatures and pHs.<br>
In genera], proteases hydrolyze amide linkages of proteins via addition of a water molecule to the peptide bond(s). Cleavage occurs at the carbonyl-group of the peptide bond.<br>
In bacterial species such as Bacillus, there are two main classes of extracellular proteases namely, alkaline or serine proteases and neutral metalloproteases.<br>
Neutral metalloendopeptidases (i.e., neutral metalloproteases) (EC 3.4.24.4) belong to a protease class that has an absolute requirement for zinc ions for catalytic activity. These enzymes are optimally active at neutral pH and are in the 30 to 40 kDa size range. Neutral metalloproteases bind between two and four calcium ions thai contribute to the structural stability of the protein. The bound metal ion at the active site of metalloproteases is an essential feature that allows the activation of a water molecule. The water molecule then functions as the nucleophile and cleaves the carbonyl group of the peptide bond.<br>
The neutral zinc-binding metalloprotease faraiiy includes the bacterial enzyme thermolysin, and thermolysin-Jike proteases ("TLPs"), as well as carboxypeptidase A (a digestive enzyme), and the matrix metalloproteases that catalyze the reactions in tissue remodeling and degradation. The onjy well characterized of these proteases, with respect to stability and function, is thermolysin and its variants (TLPs). Indeed, much research has been focused on the engineering Bacillus subtilis neutral proteases to increase the thermal stability of the enzyme (See e.g., Vriend et al., In, Tweel et al. (eds), Stability and Stabilization of enzymes. Elsevier, pp. 93-99 [1993]).<br>
Most effort has been focused on increasing the stability of the protease by altering structural determinants identified through the use of molecular modeling suggested to prevent local unfolding processes that would result in autolysis of the protein and cause the neutral protease to denature at high temperatures (See e.g., van den Burg et al., in Hopsu-Havu etal., (eds), Proteolvsis in Cell Functions Manipulating the Autolvtic Pathway of a Bacillus Protease. Biomedical and Health Research Vol. 13, IOS Press [1997] p. 576).<br>
Compositions and methods to engineer neutral metalloproteases with improved characteristics are provided herein. As indicated herein, calcium ions have been reported for other proteases such as thermolysin to prevent autolysis. The B. stearothermophilus neutral protease has been stabilized against autolysis and proteolytic degradation by addition of calcium (See, Durrschmidt et al, FEBS J., 272:1523-1534 [2005]).<br>
Indeed, the present invention provides compositions and methods suitable for the engineering of neutral metalloproteases that are independent of calcium in order to maintain their structural stability. In some embodiments, engineering prevents the local unfolding in a particular secondary structural element that may prevent proteolysis.<br>
Natural and engineered proteases, such as subtilisin are often expressed in Bacillus subtilis and several have been applied in detergent formulations to remove proteinaceous stains. Others have been applied for example in the baking industry (e.g., thermolysin from Bacillus ihennoproteotyiicus; See e.g., Galante and Formantici, Curr. Organic Chem., 7, 1399-1422 [2003]). In general, the serine proteases have been more widely utilized in detergents, at least partially due to the relative ease with which these proteases can be stabilized.<br>
Indeed, metalloproteases are less frequently used in industry, and particularly in the detergent industry for a number of reasons. These enzymes involve more complex protein systems, as the enzymes have the absolute requirement for calcium and zinc ions for stability and function, respectively. Further, the detergent solution as well as the water used in the laundry process often contains components that often interfere with the binding of the ions by the enzyme or chelate these ions, resulting in a decrease or loss of proteolytic function and destabilization of the protease.<br>
In contrast to the currently used metalloprotease enzyme systems, the present invention provides neutral metalloproteases that are sufficiently stabilized to facilitate long-term shelf storage in liquid laundry detergent compositions. In particularly preferred embodiments, the metalloprotease stability and activity are preserved through complexing the enzyme with its obligatory active-site zinc molecule. Importantly, the combination of calcium and zinc ions does not have a deleterious effect on the enzyme's function. In some embodiments, the neutral metalloprotease stabilized is the wild-type metalloprotease from Bacillus amyloHquefaciens (e.g., purified MULTIFECT® Neutral; "PMN"). In alternative preferred embodiments, recombinant neutral metalloprotease (e.g., Bacillus amyloHquefaciens neutral metalloprotease cloned into Bacillus subtilis ("nprE")). In additional embodiments, metalloproteases with improved stability encompass enzymes with increased affinity for one or more of the calcium binding sites of the enzyme.. In preferred embodiments, the neutral metalloproteases of the present invention find use in general detergent applications, including but not limited to cold water temperatures, grass stains, and/or low pH conditions.<br>
The present invention provides conditions that stabilize zinc-binding neutral metalloprotease for increased storage stability in detergent bases and/or compositions. In preferred embodiments, the detergent compositions comprise at least one metalloprotease<br>
(e.g., any Bacillus neutral metal loprotease) that is stabilized against autolysis and unfolding, by the inclusion within the detergent formulation of the essential zinc and/or calcium ions. In some particularly preferred embodiments, the neutral metalloprotease from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens (PMN) and the recombinant form expressed in Bacillus subtilis (nprE) that bind zinc ion with 10-fold greater affinity than the calcium ion find use in the present invention. The stabilized protease in the presence of essential zinc ions has improved stability against proteolysis when compared to the same proteases with in the absence of ions.<br>
Although some experimental results indicated that nprE loses some proteolytic activity (~ 20 %) after one hour of adding the detergent base, nprE incubated at 32 °C in the presence of zinc ions showed significant stabilization over the test conditions with no additional salts or calcium ions. The presence of both calcium and zinc ions did not show an additive effect. At zinc ion concentrations lower than 15 mM neutral metalloprotease is sufficiently stable over approximately 4 weeks. Thus, the present invention provides compositions comprising the addition of zinc to increase the storage life of neutral metalloprotease in the presence of detergent components.<br>
Furthermore, in alternative embodiments, the zinc cation is replaced with Co2+, Mn2+ or Fe2*, since all of these ions have been shown to bind and restore the protease activity of neutral metalloproteases.' However, it was determined that Mn2+ and Fe2* 'do not restore all of the native activity. While Co2+ restores the highest percentage of the activity, it is apparently less firmly bound than Zn2+. The zinc cation is an essential feature in the active site of all neutral metalloproteases, as it is known to play a role in substrate binding and enzyme catalysis (See e.g., Holmquist and Vallee, J. Biol. Chem., 249:4601-4607 [1974]). The relatively tight affinity of the neutral metalloprotease for the zinc cation (~ |lM range) and the approximately 10-fold greater affinity for this ion relative to calcium, suggest that zinc functions as a stabilizer, thereby preventing autolysis, proteolysis and unfolding. However, it is not intended that the present invention be limited to any particular mechanisms.<br>
The present invention provides extremely beneficial opportunities for application in the production and development of industrial detergents. Many detergents are available with high specificity towards the removal of protein, starch and grease stains. In particular, the better wash performance of PMN or neutral metalloprotease from B. amyloliquefaciens on Equest Grass (Warwick) indicates that the neutral metalloproteases of the present invention in a detergent base that also contains zinc finds use in improved detergent compositions.<br>

In these experiments, a spectrophotometer was used to measure the absorbance of the products formed after the completion of the reactions. A reflectometer was used to measure the reflectance of the swatches. Unless otherwise indicated, protein concentrations were estimated by Coomassie Plus (Pierce), using BSA as the standard.<br>
The following assays were used in the Examples described below.<br>
A.        Bradford Assay for Protein Content Determination in 96-well Microtiter Plates (MTPs)<br>
In these assays, the Bradford dye reagent (Quick Start) assay was used to determine the protein concentration in NprE protease samples on MTP scale. In this assay system, the chemical and reagent solutions used were:<br>
Quick Start Bradford Dye Reagent         BIO-RAD, #500-0205<br>
Dilution buffer	l0mM NaCl, 0.lmM CaC12, 0.005% TWEEN®-80<br>
The equipment used was a Biomek FX Robot (Beckman) and a SpectraMAX (type 340) MTP reader; the MTPs were from Costar (type 9017).<br>
In the test, 200 µl Bradford Dye Reagent was pipetted into each well, followed by 15 µl dilution buffer. Finally 10 µl of filtered culture broth were added to the wells. After thorough mixing, the MTPs were incubated for at least 10 minutes at room temperature; Possible air bubbles were blown away and the ODs of the wells were read at 595 run.<br>
To determine the protein concentration, the background reading (i.e., from uninoculated wells) was subtracted form the sample readings. The obtained OD39J values provide a relative measure of the protein content in the samples. The linearity of the NprE calibration lines between 0 to 5 ug enabled the use of OD595 nm values as a relative measure for the protein content. As the expected content of NprE in supernatant was 200-300 µg/ml, the l0µl sample volume used in the test contains less than 5 ug protein, providing values in the linear range.<br>
B,	Microswatch Assay for Testing Protease Performance<br>
The detergents used in this assay did not contain enzymes. The equipment used was a Biomek FX Robot (Beckman) and a SpectraMAX (type 340) MTP reader; the MTPs were from Costar (type 9017).<br>
Detergent Preparation (cold water liquid detergent; US conditions):<br>
Milli-Q water was adjusted to 6 gpg water hardness (Ca/Mg=3/l), and 0.78 g/1 TIDE® 2007-2x detergent was added. The detergent solution was vigorously stirred for at least 15 minutes. Then. 5 mM HEPES (free acid) was added and the pH adjusted to 8.2.<br>
Microswatches<br>
Microswatches of W circular diameter were obtained from CFT. Before cutting of the swatches, the fabric (EMPA 116) was washed with water. Two microswatches were placed in each well of a 96-well microtiter plate vertically to expose the whole surface area (/.«., not flat on the bottom of the well);<br>
Test Method<br>
The incubator was set to 20"C. The filtered culture broth samples were tested at an appropriate concentration by dilution with a mixture of 10 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM CaC12 and 0.005% TWEEN®-80 solution. The desired detergent solution was prepared as described above. Then, 190 µl of detergent solution was added to each well of the MTP, containing microswatches. To this mixture, 10 µ1 of the diluted enzyme solution were added (to provide a total volume of 200 µl/well). The MTP was sealed with tape and placed in the incubator for 30 minutes, with agitation at 1400 rpm. Following incubation under the appropriate conditions, 100 µl of solution from each well were removed and placed into a fresh MTP. The new MTP containing 100 µl of solution/well was read at 405 nm in a MTP reader. Blank controls, as well as a control containing two microswatches and detergent but no enzyme were also included.<br>
Calculation of the BM3 Performance:<br>
The obtained absorbance value was corrected for the blank value (i.e., obtained after incubation of microswatches in the absence of enzyme). The resulting absorbance was a measure for the hydrolytic activity. For each sample (e.g., nprE or variant) the performance   • index was calculated. The performance index compared the performance of the variant (actual value) and the standard enzyme (theoretical value) at the same protein concentration. In addition, the theoretical values were calculated, using the parameters of the Langmuir equation of the standard enzyme. A performance index (PI) that is greater than 1 (PI&gt;1) identified a better variant (as compared to the standard [e.g., wild-type]), while a PI of 1<br>
 (PI=1) identified a variant that performed the same as the standard, and a PI that is less than 1 (PI

Protein Determination<br>
In order to establish the desired dilution rate in the citrate stability assay the protease concentration of the wild-type NprE controls for each plate were determined with the TCA assay. In this method, 25 ul filtered culture broth were added to 200 ul 16.875% (w/v) TCA. After incubation for 10 to 15 minutes at ambient temperature, the light scattering/absorbance at 405 rim was determined. The protein concentration was determined by using a calibration line, constructed with purified NprE.<br>
Test Method<br>

Method<br>
To prepare the substrate, 4 g dimethylcasein was dissolved in 400 ml PIPES buffer. The filtered culture supernatants were diluted with PIPES buffer. Then, 10 pi of each diluted supernatant were added to 200 pi substrate in the wells of a MTP. The MTP was covered with tape, shaken for a few seconds and placed in an oven at 25°C for 30 minutes without agitation. About 15 minutes before removal of the 1" plate from the oven, the TNBS reagent<br>
was prepared by mixing 1 ml TNBS solution per 50 ml of Reagent A. MTPs were filled with 60 ul TNBS Reagent A per well. The incubated plates were shaken for a few seconds, after which 10 pi was transferred to the MTPs with TNBS Reagent A. The plates were covered with tape and shaken for 20 minutes in a bench shaker (BMG Thermostar) at room temperature and 500 rpm. Finally, 200 ul Reagent B was added to the wells, mixed for 1 minute on a shaker, and the absorbance at 405 nm was determined using a MTP reader. The obtained absorbance value was corrected for the blank value (Le., substrate without enzyme). The resulting absorbance was a measure of the hydrblytic activity. The (arbitrary) specific activity of a sample was calculated by dividing the absorbance and the determined protein concentration.<br>

F.    2-Aminobcnzoyl-L-alanylglycy]-L-leucyl-L-alanino-4-nitrobenzylamide Protease Assay ( Ab2-AGLA-Nba)<br>
The method provided below provides a degree of technical detail that yields reproducible protease assay data independent of time and place. While the assay can be adapted to a given laboratory condition, any data obtained through a modified procedure must be reconciled with results produced by the original method. Neutral metalloproteases cleave the peptide bond between glycine and leucine of 2-aminobenzoyl-L-alanylglycYl-L-leucyl-L-alanino-4-nitrobenzylamide (Abz-AGLA-Nba). Free 2-aminobenzoyl-L-alanylglycine (Abz-AG) in solution has a fluorescence emission maximum at 415 nm with an excitation maximum of 340 nm. Fluorescence of Abz-AG is quenched by nitrobenzylamide in the intact Abz-AGLA-Nba molecule.<br>
In these experiments, the liberation of Abz-AG by protease cleavage of Abz-AGLA-Nba was monitored by fluorescence spectroscopy (Ex. 340 / Em. 415). The rate of appearance of Abz-AG was a measure of proteolytic activity. Assays were performed under non-substrate limited initial rate conditions.<br>
A microplate mixer with temperature control (e.g., Eppendorf Thermomixer) was required for reproducible assay results. The assay solutions were incubated to desired temperature (e.g., 25°C) in the microplate mixer prior to enzyme addition. Enzyme solutions were added to the plate in the mixer, mixed vigorously and rapidly transferred to the plate reader.<br>
A spectrofluorometer with capability of continuous data recording, linear regression analysis, and with temperature control was required (e.g., SpectraMax M5, Gemini EM, Molecular Devices). The reader was always maintained at the desired temperature (e.g., 25°C). The reader was set for top-read fluorescence detection and the excitation was set to 350 nm and emission to 415 nm without the use of a cut-off filter. The PMT was set to medium sensitivity and 5 readings per well. Autocalibration was turned on, but only to<br>
calibrate before the first reading. The assay was measured for 3 minutes with the reading interval minimized according to the number of wells selected to be monitored. The reader was set to calculate the rate of milli-RFU/min (thousandths of relative fluorescence units per minute). The number of readings used to calculate the rate (Vmax points) was set to the number equivalent to 2 minutes, as determined by the reading interval (e.g., a reading every 10 seconds would use 12 points to calculate the rate). The max RFU was set to 50,000.<br>
All pipeting of enzyme and substrate stock solutions were done with positive displacement pipets (Rainin Microman). Buffer, assay, and enzyme working solutions were pipetted by single or multi-channel air-displacement pipets (Rainin LTS) from tubes, reagent reservoirs or stock microplates. A repeater pipet (Eppendorf) finds use iri transferring the assay solution to microplate wells when few wells are used, to minimize reagent loss. Automated pipetting instruments such as the Beckman FX or Cybio Cybi-well also find use in transferring enzyme solutions from a working stock microplate to the assay microplate in order to initiate an entire microplate at once.<br>
Reagents and Solutions:<br>
52.6 mMMES/NaOH, 2.6 mMCaCI2,pH 6.5  -  MES Buffer<br>
MES acid (10.28 g) and 292 mg anhydrous CaCl2 were dissolved in approximately 900mL purified water. The solution was titrated with NaOH to pH 6.5 (at 25°C or with temperature adjustment pH probe). The pH-adjusted buffer was made up to 1L total volume. The final solution was filtered through a 0.22 Jim sterile filter and kept at room temperature.<br>
48 mM Abz-AGLA-Nba in DMF  -  Abz-AGLA-Nha Stock<br>
Approximately 28 mg of Abz-AGLA-Nba was placed in a small tube. It was dissolved in mL of DMF (volume will vary depending upon Abz-AGLA-Nba massed) and vortexed for several minutes. The solution was stored at room temperature shielded from light<br>
50 mM MES, 23 mM CaCl2, 5% DMF, 2.4 mM Abz-AGLA-Nba pH 6.5  -  Assay Solution<br>
One mL Abz-AGLA-Nba stock was added to 19 mLMES Buffer and vortexed. The solution was stored at room temperature shielded from light.<br>
50 mM MES, 2.5 mM CaCl2, pH 6.5  -  Enzyme Dilution Buffer<br>
This buffer was produced by adding 5 mL purified water to 95 mL MES Buffer.<br>
50 mM MES, 2.5 mM CaCl2,5% DMF, pH 6.5 - Substrate Dilution Buffer<br>
Five mL pure DMF were added to 95 mL MES Buffer. This buffer was used to determine kinetic parameters.<br>
Enzyme solutions<br>
The enzyme stock solutions were diluted with enzyme dilution buffer to a concentration of approximately 1 ppm (1 ug/mL). MULTIEECT® neutral protease (wild-type NprE) was diluted to concentrations below 6 ppm (6 ug/mL). Serial dilutions were preferred. Solutions were stable at room temperature for 1 hour, but for longer term storage, the solutions were maintained on ice.<br>
Procedure<br>
Fist all buffers, stock, and working solutions were prepared. Each enzyme dilution was assayed in triplicate, unless otherwise indicated. When not completely full, the enzyme working solution stock microplate was arranged in full vertical columns starting from the left of the plate (to accommodate the plate reader). The corresponding assay plate was similarly set up. The microplate spectrofluorometer was set up as previously described.<br>
First, a 200 uL aliquot of assay solution were placed in the wells of a 96-well microplate. The plate was incubated for 10 min at 25°C in a temperature controlled microplate mixer, shielded from light. The assay was initiated by transferring 10 uL of the working enzyme solutions from the stock microplate to the assay microplate in the mixer. Optimally, 96-well pipetting head finds use, or an 8-well multi-channel pipet was used to transfer from the left-most column first. The solutions were vigorously mixed for 15 seconds (900rpm in Eppendorf Thermomixer). Immediately, the assay microplate was transferred to the microplate spectrofluorometer and recording of fluorescence measurements at excitation of 350 nm and emission of 415 nm were begun. The spectrofluorometer software calculated<br>
the reaction rates of the increase in fluorescence for each well to a linearly regressed line of milli-RFU / min. In some experiments, a second plate was placed in the microplate mixer for temperature equilibration while the first plate was being read.<br>
The rate initial velocities were linear with respect to product concentration (i.e., liberated 2-aminobenzoyl fluorescence) up to 0.3 mM product, which corresponded to approximately 50,000 RFU in a solution starting at 2.3mM Abz-AGLA-Nba with background fluorescence of approximately 22,000 RFU. Abz-AGLA-Nba was dissolved in DMF and was been used • the day it was prepared.<br>

EXAMPLE 1<br>
Cloning of the Neutral Metalloprotease Gene from B. amyloliquefaciens.<br>
In this Example, methods used to clone the B. amyloliquefaciens neutral metalloprotease gene are described. The gene-encoding neutral metalloprotease was cloned from B. amyloliquefaciens using well-established methods in this art. The non-exempt (le., the strain carries extrageneric DNA (besides the chloramphenicol selectable marker which is allowed in an exempt strain), specifically the plasmid pJM102 sequences) strain BC91504 (aprE/nprE~pJMlQ2 in BG3594::comk) carries the B. subtilis aprE promoter and signal sequence fused to B. amyloliquefaciens nprE propeptide/mature gene in integrating plasmid pJM102.<br>
The following two sequences (SEQ ID NO:1 and SEQ ID NO:2) of B.' subtilis and B. amyloliquefaciens were generated via PCR with the oligonucleotide primers corresponding to the underlined sequences.<br>
B subtilis chromosomal EcoRl restriction site (GAATTC) and aprE start codon (GTG) and B. amyloliquefaciens nprE stop codon are shown in the following sequences in boldface type as well as a synthetically introduced HindlR restriction site (AAGCTT) designed into primer # 4,<br>
The B. amyloliquefaciens aprE 5' upstream sequence, promoter and signal sequence coding region are shown in the following sequence (SEQ ID NO:1). Primer 1 (apr-f; GAGCTGGGTAAAGCCTATGAAT; SEQ ID NO:5) is shown underlined, at the beginning of the sequence, while the aprE portion of primers 2 and 3 (npr-f and npr-r; GTTCAGCAACATGTCTGCGCAGGCT; SEQ ID NO:6) are shown double underlined at the end of the sequence.   (Sequence Removed)<br>
The sequence of the B. amyloliquefaciens propeptide and mature nprE coding sequence and transcription terminator are provided in the sequence below. In this sequence, the nprE portion of primers 2 and 3 is underlined (GCTGAGAATCCTCAGCTTAAAGAAAACCTG; SEQ ID NO:7), while the npr-r portion of primer 4<br>
(GGCTTCACCATGATCATATATGTCAAGCTTGGGGGG; SEQ ID NO:8) is shown double underlined.  (Sequence Removed)<br>
The amino acid sequence of the full-length NprE (pre-, pro- and mature sequence) is provided below:<br>
(Sequence Removed)<br>
In some alternative embodiments, the following NprE sequence finds use in the present invention.<br>
(Sequence Removed)<br>
The primer sequences used in these PCR experiments are provided below:<br>
(Sequence Removed)<br>
Primers 2 and 3 are reverse complements of each other and correspond to either non-coding (#2) or coding (#3) strands of the chromosomal DNAs. For the coding strand, they correspond to the last 25 base pairs of the aprE signal sequence and the first 30 base pairs of the nprE propeptide.  Primer #4 is the reverse complement to the underlined sequence, comprising 24 base pairs 3' of the nprE stop codon and tenninator with an introduced fJindIII site preceded by six dCTP residues, to provide a so-called "clamp," allowing more efficient cleavage with Hindm restriction endonuclease, as some restriction enzymes cleave inefficiently if their recognition sequence is located at the very ends of DNA fragments.<br>
The two PCR fragments were generated with the following protocol and reagents (except DNA template and oligonucleotide primers) from Applied Biosystems' rTTH DNA Polymerase, XL Kit:<br>
40.6µl H2O<br>
30 µl 3.3x iTth PCR buffer<br>
10 µ 2 mM dNTP mix<br>
4.4 µl 25 mM Mg-acetate<br>
5 µl 50 µM primer # 1 or * 3 (forward primers)<br>
5 µl 50 µM primer # 2 or # A (reverse primers)<br>
2 µl B. sublilis or B. amyloliquefaciens chrcrnosomal DNA<br>
2 µl rTth polymerase<br>
1 µl Pfu Turbo polvmerase<br>
100 ul total reaction volume<br>
The PCR conditions used in these experiments were (95'C, 30 sec./58'C, 30sec/68°C, ] min.) x 30 cycles followed by rapid cooling to 4"C. Reactions were run on 1.2% agarose/TBE preparative gels, the appropriately-sized fragments excised and purified using the QIAGEN® Gel Extraction Kit. In a second fusion, PCR reactions were conducted in which chromosomal DNAs were replaced by 1 ul each of the two separate fragments and only outside primers Ws 1 and #2 were used. The same PCR conditions as described above were used. Due to the complementary ends formed on the two fragments from the use of complementary primers 2 and 3 in the first PCRs, the two fragments were precisely fused.<br>
The fusion fragment was digested with EcoRl and Hind/77 and gel purified as described above. The integration plasmid pJM102 was also digested with EcoKl and HincHQ, and the linear plasmid was then gel purified and ligated by standard techniques to the digested apr/npr fusion fragment. This ligation reaction was subsequently used to directly transform a xylose-induced B. subtilis strain.<br>
After purification, the two fragments were generated by PCR with primers 1 and 2 from wild-type B. subtilis chromosomal DNA, and with primers 3 and 4 from chromosomal DNA from a B. amyloliquefaciens strain. This fragment was again purified as descried above, followed by cutting with EcoRI and HindUl as in the same digestion of the integrating<br><br>
plasmid pJM102 and subsequent ligation of the fusion fragment to the plasmid. Several transformants had the fusion sequenced from the chromosome to verify the absence of any PCR-derived mutations. One of these was then amplified stepwise from 5-25 mg/mL chloramphenicol, the selectable marker on pJM102, to co-amplify the linked expression cassette.<br>
The selected sequence verified transformant was obtained by selection for pJM102's chloramphenicol (CMP) resistance marker on LB/agar plates containing 5 mg/ml CMP. This was then inoculated into LB broth at 10 mg/ml CMP overnight at 37°C, with shaking at 250 RPM. This culture was then streaked onto LB/agar plates with 10 mg/ml CMP to isolate single colonies. One colony was then inoculated into LB broth at 25 mg/ml CMP overnight, at 37*C, with shaking at 250 RPM. This culture was then streaked to LB/agar plates with 25 mg/ml CMP to isolate single colonies. These colonies were harvested and stored in glycerol at -70°C until use, as known in the art.<br>
The deletion of the two non-essential proteases present in J3. subtilis (aprE and nprE), as well as amylase, reduced the total extracellular protease level during the production of metalloprotease. The DNA encoding the neutral metalloprotease was cloned into an amylase-deleted host. The inducible comK for competence development was inserted in the middle of the amylase locus, making the strain "amyV The secretion of the expressed protein was ensured by insertion of the nucleotides encoding the signal sequence prior to the coding sequence of the gene.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
Expression and Fermentation of the Purified MULTIFECT® Neutral and Recombinant<br>
Neutral Metalloprotease (nprE).<br>
The recombinant Bacillus subtilis produced as described in Example 1 was cultivated by conventional batch fermentation in a nutrient medium as described below. One glycerol vial (prepared as described in Example 1) of B. subtilis culture containing the B. amyloliquefaciens neutral metalloprotease was used to inoculate 600 ml of SBGl % medium containing 200 mg/L chloramphenicol. The cultures were grown for 48 hours at 37°C, after which time, the culture fluid was recovered by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm, as known in the<br>
art. This procedure was done in duplicate. The final enzyme concentrations obtained were in • the range of about 1.4 and 2 g/L.<br>
EXAMPLES Purification and Characterization of Neutral Metalloprotease<br>
This Example describes the methods used to purify the neutral metalloprotease expressed by the organisms described in Example 2. After 36 hours of incubation at 37 °C, -the fermentation broth was recovered and centrifuged at 12 000 rpm (SORVALL® centrifuge model RC5B). The secreted neutral meialloproteases were isolated from the culture fluid and concentrated approximately 10-fold using an Amicon filter system 8400 with a BES (polyethersulfone) lOkDa cutoff.<br>
The concentrated supernatant was dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against 25 mM MES buffer, pH 5.4, containing 10 mM NaCl. The dialysate was then loaded onto a cation-exchange column Porous HS20 (total volume ~ 83 mL; binding capacity - 4.5g protein/mL column; Waters) as described below. The column was pre-equilibrated with 25 mM MES buffer, pH 5.4, containing ] 0 mM NaCl. Then, approximately 200-300 mL of sample was loaded onto the column. The bound protein was eluted using a pH gradient from 5.4 to 6.2 •over 10-column volumes of MES buffer. Elution of the protein was between pH 5.82 and 6.0, and was assessed using proteolytic activity as described herein and 10 % (w/v) NUPAGE® SDS-PAGE (Novex). The neutral protease containing fractions were then pooled. Calcium and zinc chloride salts in the ratio of 3:1 were added prior to the adjustment of the pH to 5.8. The Perceptive Biosystems BIOCAD® Vision (GMT) was used for protein purification.<br>
The purified protein, assessed using a 10 % (w/v) NUPAGE® SDS-PAGE, was determined to homogenous, with greater than 95 % purity. Typically, less than 1% of the purified preparations showed serine protease activity when assessed using the standard protease assay with the small substrate, suc-p-AAPF-pNA (N-succinyl-L-Ala-L-Ala-L-Pro-L-Phe-/?-nitroanilide) (Sigma). This assay was performed in microtiter plate format (96 well) using a 100 mM Tris-HCJ buffer, pH 8.5, containing 10 mM CaCl2 and 0.005 % TWEEN®-80. The substrate (p-AAPF NA) was prepared by making a 160 mM stock in DMSO (dimethylsulfoxide) (100 mgAnl) and diluting this stock 100-fold with the Tris-HCl buffer containing CaCJ2 and 0.005 % TWEEN®-80. Then, 10 uL of diluted protease solution<br>
(dilutions were prepared using 100 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.5, containing 10 mM CaClj and 0.005 % TWEEN-80) was added to 190 uL Img/ml p-AAPF solution. The assay was mixed for 5 minutes and the kinetic change at 410 nm was read over 2 to 5 minutes. The slope of the response was measured and used as an indication of the amount of serine protease, activity. The protein was formulated for storage using 25 mM MES buffer, pH 5.8, containing 1 mM zinc chloride, 4 mM calcium chloride, and 40 % propylene glycol.<br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
Affinity of Purified MULTIFECT® Neutral Metalloprotease (PMN) for Calcium and Zinc Cations<br>
In this Example, methods to determine the affinity of the neutral metalloprotease (PMN) prepared as described in the above Examples are described. The affinities of PMN for calcium and zinc ions were performed using the fluorescent indicators Fluo-3 and FluoZin-3, respectively obtained from Molecular Probes. All fluorescence measurements were recorded on a LS50B Luminescence spectrophotometer (Perkin-Elmer). The binding of Fluo-3 was monitored by excitation at 500 nm and the emission spectra were recorded from 505 to 550 nm. Similarly, the binding of FluoZin-3 was monitored by excitation at 495 nm and the emission spectra were collected from 500 to 550 nm. The excitation and emission slit width were both set at 2.5 nm.<br>
In these determinations, 100 uM neutral metalloprotease in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.4, was titrated with increasing amounts of the relevant indicator. The titration curves are shown in Figure 1. In this Figure, the triangles represent the curve binding data obtained for Zn2+, using the Fluo-Zin3 dye monitored at 516 nm, while the circles represent the data obtained for Ca2+ using the Fluo-3 dye monitored at 522 nm. The association constants (Ka's) for zinc and calcium (assuming a single binding site) were determined to be 0.401 nM and 0.037 nM, respectively. These results indicate that purified MULTIFECT® neutral metalloprotease bound the zinc ion with approximately 10-fold greater affinity than the calcium ion. Based on the weaker binding of calcium, initial protein engineering experiments are designed to involve either (i) designing tighter calcium binding site(s) and/or (ii) eliminating the structural stability requirement for calcium (e.g., to stabilize the protein to greater than 80 %).<br>
EXAMPLE 5 Storage Stability<br>
In this Example, experiments conducted to assess the storage stability of PMN and recombinant B. amyloliquefaciens neutral metalloprotease expressed in B. subtilis are described. Proteolysis of these neutral metalloprotease preparations was assessed in the presence of increasing LAS (lauryl sodium sulfate; Sigma) solutions (0 % up to an including 10 %). Proteolytic fragments generated from the purified MULTIFECT® neutral metalloprotease (PMN) were observed using 10 % (w/v) NUPAGE® SDS-PAGE.<br>
The storage stability of the recombinant neutral metalloprotease from B. amyloliquefaciens expressed in B. subtilis produced as described above, was determined in buffer alone (50 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.4) and in the presence of detergent base obtained from Procter &amp; Gamble. The buffer and/or detergent base contained zinc ions, calcium ions or a combination thereof. The concentration of both the zinc and calcium ions was varied from 0 to 25 mM. These results were always compared with those for the neutral metalloprotease incubated in buffer alone.<br>
Protease Assays<br>
Azo-casein Assay:<br>
The azo-casein endpoint assay was used to assess the amount of proteolysis that occurred under certain conditions. In these assays, 75 uL of enzyme were incubated with excess calcium or zinc or both ions added to 250 µl of 1 % (w/v) azo-casein (Sigma). The reaction proceeded at 30 °C for 15 minutes, after which 10 % (w/v) trichloroacetic acid was added to stop the reaction. The precipitated protein and the unreacted azo-casein were removed by centrifugation for 10 minutes at 14 000 rpm. The color of the azo-group was developed by addition of 750 µL 1 M sodium hydroxide. The development of the color proceeded for 5 minutes, after which the reaction was stopped and the absorbance was measured at 440 nm.<br>
Succinvlated-casein and TNBSA assay:<br>
The activity of the neutra} metalloprotease was determined using the QuantiCeave Protease Assay Kit™ (Pierce). This assay is based on the digestion of succinylated-casein by the enzyme. The primary amino groups formed are then reacted with trinitrobenzene suJfonic acid (TNBSA) and form a colored complex that has maximum absorbance at 450 nm. The assay is performed in 96-weIl microtiter format. The assay requires a 15-minute incubation with the succinylated casein and a 15-minute reaction with the TNBSA. During both incubations, the samples are placed on a shaker. TPCK-trypsin (Pierce) is the general standard used for overall protease activity determinations. However, optimum conditions for activity for specific proteases require the use of the protease of interest. In the case of the assays performed in these experiments, both trypsin and the protease of interest were used, in order to calibrate the assay. The accuracy of the assay requires that the standard dilutions made of 0.5 mg/mL trypsin always result in absorbance values (at 450 nm) below 0.5.<br>
Every sample was measured relative to a control containing no casein. The reported change in absorbance (AAbs(450 nm)) accounts for the interference from the amino groups of casein. Further, any possible interference from primary amino groups in the buffer and/or; other components of the detergent was/were also corrected for in this manner. The activity of all samples was determined relative to detergent with no added neutral metalloprotease, as well as for enzyme incubated in BupH™ borate buffer supplied with the kit, for the same length of time and at the same temperature.<br>
This test is an end-point assay, in which 50 mM borale buffer, pH 8.5, was used at 32 °C. The protease assays were typically performed in duplicate. In most experiments to determine stability measurements, the protein and detergent were diluted using the above-mentioned buffer by 1:1000, although in some experiments dilutions of were also 1:500 or 1: 200, in order to obtain readings where the absorbance of the blanks was less than 0.5. The microtiter spectrophotometer used in these experiments was a SpectraMax250® (Molecular Devices) and a]] assays were conducted in medium protein-binding 96-well plates (Corning).<br>
The results for the standards protein samples (eg., trypsin and purified metalloprotease) obtained in these assays indicated that there was a non-linear response (a linear scale may be adequate only in a narrow assay range). Hence, the curve was fitted to a quadratic function where f = yc+ax2 +bx; f is fit to y (SigmaPlot* v. 9; SPSS, Inc.). Thus, if a linear equation was used to quantitate the amount of protein, inaccurate data were obtained; the quadratic equation was found to be required in order to obtain accurate results. It is noted<br>
that the manufacturer's (Pierce) kit insert indicates that the results may be fitted with "x" being a log scale.<br>
EXAMPLE6 Effect of pH and LAS on Neutral Metalloprotease Activity<br>
The pH optimum of the activity for 0.36 mg/mL of formulated nprE was also determined. The buffers investigated in this study were 50 mM sodium acetate over the pH range 3.5-5.5 (pKa = 4.76), 50 mM MES buffer over the pH range 5.5 to 7.0 (pKa = 6.10), and 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer at pH 8.4. The pH optimum for formulated nprE was determined to be between 5.5 and 6.0.<br>
The effect of the detergent component LAS on the activity of 0.36 mg/ml of .formulated nprE was investigated by incubation with 0 to 1 % (w/v) LAS. The results are shown in the graph provided at Figure 2. As these results indicate, the protease is significantly inactivated by the detergent component, thereby necessitating a means to stabilize the protease against this deleterious effect.<br>
In some experiments, the high density liquid detergent (HDL) composition designated as 'TIDE® 2005," provided by Procter &amp; Gamble was used. As supplied, this detergent contained all necessary components, except for the neutral metalloprotease of the present invention.<br>
Storage Stability in Liquid Detergent Base as a Function of Time<br>
The stability test was performed in a mini-storage manner. The conditions to be varied and the various concentrations of calcium and zinc chloride salts to be added were assessed using a matrix designed using the FusionPro™ (S-Matrix) software. The following table summarizes the conditions tested to ascertain the long-term storage stability of neutral metalloprotease from B. amyloliquefaciens.  <br>
Table 6. Long-Term Storage Test Conditions <br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The final volume of each tested condition was 1 mL. TIDE® 2005 was dosed with 0:36 mg enzyme/mL. Formulated culture fluid and purified recombinant metalloprotease were incubated in the TIDE® 2005 base at 32 °C over a period of approximately 4 weeks. The storage stability of the metalloprotease in detergent was compared to the stability of the neutral metalloprotease in 50 mM MES buffer, pH 5.8.<br>
Prior to testing, the samples were diluted 5 in 1000 using assay buffer (50 mM borate buffer, pH 8.5). The residual activity was determined and compared relative to the neutral metalloprotease in assay buffer. All measurements were determined in duplicate. Each sample was tested in parallel with appropriate control blanks (i'.e., the detergent, buffer and any necessary additives being tested). The samples were then assayed as described in the instructions provided with the QuantiCleave™ Protease Assay Xit (Pierce).<br>
The results of these stability tests conducted over a 3-4 week period are shown in Figure 22. In TIDE® 2005, the neutral metalloprotease in the absence of ions (i.e., no added salt) rapidly lost all of its proteolytic/hydrolytic activity against casein. Indeed it was determined that less than 20% of the activity remained after less than 1 hour of incubation. In contrast, incubation of nprE in TIDE® 2005 containing zinc ions (up to and including 15 . mM) stabilized the protease and prevented proteolysis over a 7-day period. Thus, the presence of zinc ions in this formulation functioned well in maintaining at least 60 % of the protease activity. Likewise, a concentration of 7.5 mM zinc ions resulted in a similar stabilization effect. This concentration of zinc ions is exceeding low and is contemplated to find use in a variety of detergent formulations.   In these experiments, no added effect was<br>
provided by the inclusion of calcium ions. Furthermore, the addition of calcium ions in excess of 15 mM, and up to and including 25 mM, induced precipitation when added to TIDE® 2005 base. Although it is not intended that the present invention be limited to any particular mechanism, it was contemplated that the absence of an effect of added calcium ions on protease stabilization in these experiments was the result of the detergent composition.<br>
For thermolysin, which displays 55 % amino acid sequence identity with neutral metalloprotease from B. amyloliquefaciens (sequence alignment performed using CLUSTAL .W, v. 1.82), it has been clearly shown that zinc ions are essential for activity, whereas the calcium ions and engineering of the calcium binding sites have been shown to play a stabilization role (See e.g., Mansfield., et al., J. Biol. Chem., 272:11152-11156 [1997]; and Van den Berg et al, Biotechnol. Appl. Biochem., 30:35-40 [1999]).<br>
In alternative embodiments, other cations (e.g., Co2*, Mn2+ and Fe2*) find use in the present invention for the stabilization of neutral metalloprotease from B. amyloliquefaciens. This is in contrast to prior data that has indicated that none of these ions resulted in 100 % restoration of specific activity (Holmquist. and Vallee, J. Biol. Chem., 249:4601-4607 [1974]). It is contemplated that these ions will affect stability by preventing the unfolding and subsequent proteolytic degradation of the metalloprotease. However, it is not intended that the present invention be limited to any particular mechanism of action.<br>

5)	25 cycles of steps 2 to 4; and<br>
6)	5 min 72°C.<br>
This resulted in a 1.9 kb DNA fragment which was digested using BglK and Ben<br>
DNA restriction enzymes. The multicopy Bacillus vector pUBl 10 (See e,g., Gryczan, J.<br>
Bacteriol., 134:318-329 [1978]) was digested with BamHL. The PCR fragment x BgUI x Bell<br>
was then ligated in the pUB 110 x BamHX vector to form pUBnprE expression vector (See,<br>
Figure 14).	.<br>
pUBnprE was transformed to a B. subtilis (AaprE, AnprE, oppA, AspoIJE, degUHy32, &amp;amyE::(xylR,pxylA-comlC) strain: Transformation into B. subtilis was performed as described in WO 02/14490, incorporated herein by reference. Selective growth of B. s ubtilis Iransformants harboring the pUBnprE vector was performed in shake flasks containing 25 ml MBD medium (a MOPS based defined medium), with 20 mg/L neomycin. MBD medium was made essentially as known in the art (See, Neidhardt et al., J. Bacteriol., 119:736-747 [1974]), except that NH4Cl2, FeSO4, and CaCJ2 were left out of the base medium, 3 mM KZHPO4 was used, and the base medium was supplemented with 60 mM urea, 75 g/L glucose, and 1 % soytone. Also, the micronutrients were made up as a 100 X stock containing in one liter, 400 mg FeSO4 .7H20,100 mg MnSO4 .H20,100 mg ZnSO4.7H20,50<br>
rog CuCl2.2B2O,100 mg CoCl2.6H20,100 mg NaMoO4.2H20,100 mg Na2B4O7.10H20,10 ml of 1M CaCl2, and 10 ml of 0.5 M sodium citrate. The culture was incubated for three days at 37°C in an incubator/shaker (Infers). This culture resulted in the production of secreted NprE protease with proteolytic activity as demonstrated by protease assays. Gel analysis was performed using NuPage Novex 10% Bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen, Cat.No. NP0301BOX). To prepare samples for analysis, 2 volumes of supernatant were mixed with 1 volume 1M HC1,1 volume 4xLDS sample buffer (Invitrogen, Cat.No. NP0007), and 1% PMSF (20 mg/ml) and subsequently heated for 10 minutes at 70°C. Then, 25 µL of each sample were loaded onto the gel, together with 10 µL of SeeBlue plus 2 pre-stained protein standards (Invitrogen, Cat.No.LC5925). The results clearly demonstrated that the nprE cloning strategy described in this example yield active NprE produced by B. subtilis.<br>
EXAMPLES Generation of nprE Site Evaluation Libraries (SELs)<br>
In this Example, methods used in the construction of nprE SELs are described. The pUBnprE vector, containing the nprE expression cassette described above, served as template • DNA. This vector contains a unique Bgffl restriction site, which was utilized in the site evaluation library construction.<br>
The pUBnprE expression vector, primers, synthesized at Invitrogen (desalted, 50<br>
nmol scale) were used to generate the libraries. The sequences of the primers are provided in<br>
Table 8-1.	.<br>
To construct a nprE site evaluation library, three PCR reactions were performed, including two mutagenesis PCRs to introduce the mutated codon of interest in the mature nprE DNA sequence and a third PCR used to fuse the two mutagenesis PCRs in order to construct the pUBnprE expression vector including the desired mutated codon in the mature nprE sequence..<br>
The method of mutagenesis was based on the codon-specific mutation approach, in which the creation of all possible mutations at a time in a specific DNA triplet was performed using a forward and reverse oligonucleotide primer with a length of 25 to 45 nucleotides enclosing a specific designed triple DNA sequence NNS ((A,C,T or G), (A,C,T or G), (C or G)) that corresponded with the sequence of the codon to be mutated and guaranteed random<br>
incorporation of nudeotides at that specific nprE mature codon. The number listed in the primer names (See, Table 8-1) corresponds with the specific nprE mature codon position.<br>
Two additional primers used to construct the site evaluation libraries contained the BglE restriction site together with a part of the pUBnprE DNA sequence flanking the 8gIU restriction site. These primers were produced by Invitrogen (50nmole scale, desalted) and are listed in Table 8-1.  ‘<br>
Table 8-1. Primer Sequences  (Table Removed)<br>
Construction of each site evaluation library started with two primary PCR amplifications using the pUB-BglD-FW primer and a specific nprE reverse mutagenesis primer. For the second PCR, the pUB-BglD -RV primer and a specific nprE forward mutagenesis primer (equal nprE mature codon positions for the forward and reverse mutagenesis primers) were used.<br>
The introduction of the mutations in the mature nprE sequence was performed using Phusion High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (Finnzymes; Cat. no. F-530L). All PCRs were performed according to the Finnzymes protocol supplied with the polymerase. The PCR conditions for the primary PCRs were:<br>

The PCR experiments result in two fragments of approximately 2 to 3 kB, which had about 30 nucleotide base overlap around the NPRE mature codon of interest Fragments were fused in a third PCR reaction using these two aforementioned fragments and the forward and reverse Bglfi primers. The fusion PCR reaction was carried out in the following solution:<br>

The PCR fusion program was as follows: 30 seconds 98°C, 30x (10 seconds 98°C, 20 seconds 55°C, 2:40 minute 72°C) and 5 min 72°C, in a PTC-200 Peltier thermal cycler (MJ Research).<br>
The amplified linear 6.5 Kb fragment was purified using the Qiaquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Cat. no. 28106) and digested with BglQ restriction enzyme to create cohesive ends on both sides of the fusion fragment:<br>
-	35 µL purified linear DNA fragment<br>
-	4 µL REACT * 3 buffer (Invitrogen)<br>
-1 µL BglII, 10 units/ml (Invitrogen)<br>
Reaction conditions: 1 hour, 30°C.<br>

-1 µL T4 DNA Ligase, 1 unit/µL (Invitrogen* Cat. no. 15224-017) Reaction conditions: 16-20 hours, 16°<br>
Subsequently, the 1 igation mixture was transformed to a B. subtilis (AoprE, AnprE, oppA, hspollE, degUHy32, kamyE::(xylR,pxylA-comK) strain. Transformation to B. subtilis was performed as described in WO 02/14490, incorporated herein by reference. For each library, 96 single colonies were picked and grown in MOPS media with neomycin and 1.25 g/L yeast extract for sequence analysis (BaseClear) and screening purposes. Each library included a maximum of 19 nprE site-specific variants.<br>
The variants were produced by growing the B. subtilis SEL transformants in 96 well MTP at 37°C for 68 hours in MBD medium with 20 mg/L neomycin and 1.25 g/L yeast extract (See, above).<br>
EXAMPLE 9 Generation of nprE Combinatorial Libraries (RCLs)<br>
In this Example, methods used to generate nprE combinatorial libraries are described. For this enzyme, one property was chosen as the property that needed to be changed the most. This property is defined herein as the "primary property." All other properties were' "secondary properties" for the purpose of combinatorial library design. The basic strategy for improving a protein as used herein, was to combine mutations that improve the primary property and also maintain or improve the secondary properties. The site evaluation data were used to identify those mutations which improved the primary property while maintaining or improving the secondary properties. Mutations that were to be combined were identified by their Performance Index (PI or Pi) and associated AAGipp values.<br>
The "Apparent Free Energy Change" (AAGipp) as used herein is defined as:<br>
where P variant  the performance value for the variant and Parent is the performance value for the parent enzyme under the same conditions. The ratio Pvariant P parent is defined as the performance index (Pi) for the property. The AAGW values were expected to behave in a similar fashion to actual AAG values for data distributions and additivity. However, since AAG represents the maximum amount of work that can be carried out by the variant compared to the parent enzyme, the quantity AAGm generally underestimates the AAG and may lead to results that appear synergistic in that the properties of two additive positions may be greater than the value predicted by adding their AAGapp values together.<br>
For example, when TIDE® stability is the primary property and BMI activity is the secondary property, mutations that have AAGam, values 1) and BMI AAG,pp values 0.9) may be chosen for combination. Indeed, these relationships were explored in these experiments.<br>
To produce the variants used in these experiments, synthetic nprE library fragments, containing multiple mutations at multiple nprE mature DNA positions, were produced by GeneArt (Geneart). These 1.5 kB nprE library fragments were digested with DNA restriction enzymes Pvul and Aval, purified and ligated in the 5 kB pUB vector fragment (also digested with DNA restriction enzymes Pvul and Aval) by a ligase reaction using T4 DNA Ligase (Invitrogen* Cat. no. 15224-017).    .<br>
To transform the ligation reaction mix directly into Bacillus cells, the library DNA (nprE library fragment mix ligated in pUB vector fragment) was amplified using the TempliPhi kit (Amersham cat. #25-6400). For this purpose, 1µL of the ligation reaction mix was mixed with 5µL of sample buffer from the TempliPhi kit and heated for 3 minutes at 95 *C to denature the DNA. The reaction was placed on ice to cool for 2 minutes and then    . spun down briefly. Next, 5pL of reaction buffer and 0.2}iL of phi29 polymerase from the TempliPhi kit were added, and the reactions were incubated at 30*C in an MJ Research PCR machine for 4 hours. The phi29 enzyme was heat inactivated in the reactions by incubation at 65*C for 10 min in the PCR machine.<br>
For transformation of the libraries into Bacillus, 0.1 yL of the TempliPhi amplification reaction product was mixed with 500 pL of competent B. subtilis cells (AaprE, AnprE, oppA, AspoDE, degUHy32, AamyE::(xylR,pxylA-comK) followed by vigorous<br>
/<br>
shaking at 37*C for 1 hour. Then, 100 and 500 uL were plated on Hl-agar plates containing 20 mg/L neomycin and 0.5% skim milk. In general, transformation to B. subtilis was<br>
performed as described in WO 02/14490, incorporated herein by reference. B. subtilis nprE combinatorial libraries, constructed by this method are contemplated to contain wild type amino acids at one or more of the positions targeted for mutagenesis.    <br>
The variants obtained in these libraries were then tested for their stability in TIDE® and their performance in BMI wash performance tests as described herein. Table 9 provides performance indices for the variants tested in the BMI assay. In this Table, "Pos." indicates the position in the NprE amino acid sequence that was changed, and "AA" indicates the amino acid substitution made for each variant.         <br>

Methods:<br>
To obtain the pUBnprE vector, a single colony of a Bacillus strain containing the pUBnprE vector was used to inoculate a 5ml LB + l0ppm neomycin tube. This was the starter culture used in these methods. The culture was grown at 37°C, with shaking at 225 rpm for 6 hours. Then, 100 ml of fresh LB + l0ppm neomycin were inoculated with 1ml of the starter culture. This culture was grown overnight at 37°C, with shaking at .225 rpm. Following this incubation, the cell pellet was harvested by sufficient centrifugation to provide a cell pellet. The cell pellet was resuspended in 10 ml Buffer PI (Qiagen Plasmid Midi Kit). Then, l0ul of Ready-Lyse Lysozyme was added to the resuspended cell pellet and incubated at 37°C for 30 min. Then, the Qiagen Plasmid Midi Kit protocol was continued (using 10ml of Buffer P2 and P3 to account for the increased volume of cell culture). After isolation of pUBnprE vector from Bacillus, the concentration of pUBnprE vector was quantitated. The vector was then dam methylated using the dam Methylase Kit (New England Biolabs), using the methods set forth in the kit protocols, to methylate approximately 2 ug of pUBnprE vector per tube. The Zymoclean Gel DNA recovery kit was used to purify and concentrate the dam-methylated pUBnprE vector. The dam-methylated pUBnprE vector was quantitated and then diluted to a working concentration, of 50ng/ul. Complementary site-directed mutagenic primers (1 ul of each primer at lOuM) (See, Table 10-1), were .used in a PCR reaction in the QuikChange Multi Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene), following the manufacturer's protocol (e.g., lul dam methylated pUBnprE vector (50ng/ul), lul nprE site-directed Forward . mutagenic primer (l0uM), lul nprE site-directed Forward mutagenic primer (l0uM), 2.5ul l0x QuikChange Multi Reaction buffer, lul dNTP Mix, lul QuikChange Multi enzyme blend (2.5U/ul), and 17.5ul distilled, autoclaved water, to provide a 25ul total reaction mix). The nprE site evaluation libraries were amplified using the following conditions: 95°C, for 1 min. (ltt cycle only), followed by 95°C for 1 min., 55°C for 1 min, 65°C for 13 Vi min., and repeat cycling 23 times. The reaction product was stored at 4°C overnight. Then, the reaction mixture underwent Dpril digest treatment (supplied with QuikChange Multi Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit) to digest parental pUBnprE vector, using the manufacturer's protocol (i.e.,<br>
1.5ul Dpnl restriction enzyme was added to each tube and incubated at 37°C for 3 hours; 2ul of DpnI-digested PCR reaction was then analyzed on a 1.2% E-gel for each nprE SEL to ensure PCR reaction worked and that parental template was degraded). TempliPhi rolling circle amplification was then used to generate large amounts of DNA for increasing library size of each nprE SEL, using the manufacturer's protocol (i.e., lul Dpnl treated QuikChange Multi Site-Directed Mutagenesis PCR, 5ul TempliPhi Sample Buffer, 5ul TempliPhi Reaction Buffer, and 0.2ul TempliPhi Enzume Mix, for an ~1 lul total reaction; incubated at 3Q°C for 3 hours; the TempliPhi reaction was diluted by adding 200ul distilled, autoclaved water and briefly vortexed. Then, 1.5ul of diluted TempliPhi material was transformed into competent B. subtilis cells, and nprE SELs were selected for using LA + l0ppm Neomycin + 1.6% skim milk plates. Table 10-1 provides the names, sequences and SEQ ID NOS for the primers used in these experiments. All of the primers were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies, on l00nmole scale, 5'-phosphorylated, and PAGE purified.  <br><br>

E.        Homology Modeling<br>
In yet additional embodiments, a homology model of the mature domain of NprE from Bacillus amyloliqmfadens is provided. In these experiments, the protein sequence of the mature domain of the NprE sequence (SEQ ID NO: 192) was run through the program BlastP (NCBI). This program matches the sequence to other known sequences of varying sequence identity. From the output, sequences for which an X-ray crystal structures are known were identified. These sequences included S. aureus Npr (pdb id 1BQB) P. aeruginosa Npr (pdb idlEZM), B. thermolyticus thermolysin (pdb id 1KEI) and B. cereus Npr (pdb id 1NPC). Figure 5 provides a sequence alignment of the various sequences analyzed. (SEQ ID NOS:192-195)<br>
The sequence of the B. cereus Npr was found to be the most identical to NprE. B. thermolyticus thermolysin (pdb id 1KEI) was excluded from subsequent steps as it is very similar to B. cereus Npr. A homology model was then prepared as detailed below, and all calculation were made using the program MOE (Chemical Computing). First, the S. aureus Npr (pdb id 1BQB; SEQ ID NO:193) P. aeruginosa Npr (pdb idlEZMXSEQ ID NO: 194), and B. cereus Npr (pdb id 1NPC)(SEQ ID NO:195) sequences . were aligned using known structure, in order to obtain the most accurate sequence alignment (i.e., a structure based sequence alignment was produced). Next, the NprE mature sequence was aligned to this structure based sequence alignment Then, an initial homology model of NprE was produced using the JB. cereus Npr (pdb id INPC) structure as a template, and using the sequence alignment of NprE to B. cereus Npr produced above. It was clear from inspection of this alignment that whereas B. cereus Npr contains four Ca2* ion binding sites, while NprE only contains two Ca2+ ion binding sites.<br>
Finally, after the initial homology model was built, the metal ions (i.e., Zn2*, and two Ca2* ) were computationally fixed, as were their respective protein ligands. The rest of the. model structure was computationally minimized using the CHARMM22 parameter set, resulting in the final homology model.<br>

Drying conditions:       Spin-drier, Grass stains were dried to the air, covered with dark clothes. The other stains were ironed.<br>
Measuring swatches:    Tristimulus Minolta Meter CR-300 with equation L (L*a*b), D65 Std. Illuminate, on a white background. Expressed on Delta % Soil Removal. 3 readings per swatch (before and after washing)<br>
% Stain Removal = (L value after washing - L value before washing)/(L0mmn- L value<br>
before washing) x 100%	.<br>
All experiments were done in quadruplicate<br>
The proteases were tested in a specially developed washing test, using three different cotton swatches, soiled with:<br>
(a)	milk, blood and ink (10.0 x 7.5 cm; EMPA), designated with the numbers 116<br>
unfixed and fixed (the stains were fixed at 20°C);<br>
(b)	grass medium (10.0 x 7.5 cm; Equest); and<br>
(c)	pigment, oil and milk (10.0 x 7.5 cm designated with the numbers C-lO CFT).<br>
These experiments are described in greater detail below. The washing tests were performed in a bench top model Terg-O-Tometer (US Testing), equipped with six stainless steel test vessels. The stainless steel test vessels each contained 1.6 g of TIDE® 2005 liquid detergent base, dissolved in 1000 ml water of 105 pprn/6 grains per gallon, and were each loaded with six of the same soiled cotton swatches and two extra ballast cotton swatches (EMPA 221). A selected protease (e.g., neutral metalloprotease or another protease) was added to each vessel in a concentration from 0.00 to 5.50 mg active protein per liter suds.<br>
The tests were carried out for 12 minutes at 15 °C/60 °F, with an agitation of 100 rpm. After washing, the swatches were rinsed for 3 minutes under cold tap water and placed<br><br>
in a spin-drier. The grass swatches were air-dried and covered with dark clothing to limit the sensitivity of the grass stains to light. All other swatches were ironed. All experiments were performed in quadruplicate.<br>
The reflectance of the tested swatches was measured with a Tristimulus Minolta Meter CR-300 using the equation L (L*a*b). Wash performance values were calculated using the following relationship:<br>
% Stain Removal = (L value after washing - L value before washing)/(Lo white cotter- L value before washing) x 100%<br>
The results of the Terg-O-Tometer (TOM) assay for purified MULTffECT® arc shown in Figure 26, and compared with those of subtilisin (BPN1 Y217L), a serine alkaline protease. The TOM provided a fully operational and valid means for discriminating between the different wash performances of various proteases (e.g., serine proteases, neutral metalloprotease, and variants thereof). The TOM tests were performed on BMI and Equest medium-soiled grass surface with TIDE® 2005 as the base detergent.<br>
As indicated in Figure 26, it was apparent that the purified neutral metalloprotease clearly performed better in the wash test than the serine protease (BPN' Y217L). In particular, 2.75 ppm of purified neutral metalloprotease was required to show a delta soil removal of - 10 % compared to only 0.55 ppm of the serine protease (BPN' Y217L) on the Equest grass stain. The wash performance of the neutral metalloprotease was also tested at low temperature and found to perform very well medium solid Equest stain fabric. Similar results were obtained with purified commercially available MTLTIFECT® neutral protease as with the recombinant nprE produced as described above.<br>

EXAMPLE14 Stability of nprE Variants<br>
In this Example, experiments conducted to determine the stability of nprE variants are described. In these experiments, the methods describe prior to Example 1 were used to determine the performance indices (.See, "NprE stability assays in the presence of detergent" above). The following tables provide the results for those variants with Performance Indices greater than one (PI&gt;1) tested with and without DTPA.<br>
The stability was measured by determining AGLA activity before and after incubation at elevated temperature. The table contains the relative stability values compared to WT under mese conditions. It is the quotient of (Variant residual activity/WT residual activity). A value greater than one indicates higher stability in the presence of detergent. In Tables 14.1 and 14.2, data are provided showing the relative stability data of single-substitution variants of NprE relative to the stability of the WT NprE stability under these conditions, with and without DTPA.<br>

The swatches were prepared for treatment. Three replicates per treatment were conducted, with 18 swatches used per treatment. The grass swatches were prepared in a dark room to prevent fading. The reflectance values of about 18 soiled swatches were obtained using a Minolta Chromameter. Three readings were obtained per swatch. The L values, average L value and standard deviation were recorded. This is the LinWai value.<br>
The detergent solution was prepared as follows (for 40 L total). It was preferred to prepare this solution the night before testing. The solution was stored in the cold over night The solution was prepared by adding 39.724 Kg of DI water to 50 L mix tank, starting the agitator, mixing in 60 grams of TIDE® liquid detergent, .mixing in 16 mL of water hardness solution, and 200 mL of 1 M Bis-TRIS-propane. The pH was adjusted using concentrated sulfuric acid (adjusted to 0.2 pH units below desired pH, if solution was stored overnight), as pH creeps up overnight). The final concentrations were: TIDE® = 1.5 g/L; water hardness = 6 gpg; and Bis-TRIS-propane = 5 mM.<br>
For testing in the Terg-O-Tometer, 1 L of detergent solution was added to each Terg pot and allowed to come to temperature. Enzyme was added to the pots at varying concentrations.<br>
For BMI tests, the enzyme concentrations used were 0 mg/L, 0.275 mg/L, 0.55 mg/ml, 1.65 mg/L, 2.65 mg/L, and 5,50 mg/L. For grass stains, the nprE concentrations Used were 0 mg/L, 0.1925 mg/L, 0.385 mg/L, 1.155 mg/L, 1.925 mg/L, and 3.85 mg/L (the concentrations of BPN' Y217L were the same as those used in the BMI tests). Agitation was started and the swatches were added. All replicates were run side-by-side in the same Terg-O-Tometer (e.g., OX &amp; H X in the 1" run, IX &amp; 3X in the 2nd run, and 5X &amp; 10X in the 3rd run). The temperature was 15°C, the agitation speed was 100 cpm, and the wash time was 12 minutes. The treated swatches were rinsed three times in 4 L tap water (-6 gpg). The swatches were air-dried overnight on paper towels. The grass swatches were covered with paper towels and allowed to dry in a darkened .   • room. The reflectance values of the dried swatches were determined as described above. Three readings were obtained per swatch. The L values, average L value and standard deviation were recorded. This is the Las] value.<br>
The percentage of soil removal (%SR) was determined for each testing condition and both enzymes using the equation below:<br>
%SR =<br>
Where: LO = reflectance of unsoiled swatches<br>
i - reflectance of soiled swatches reflectance of washed swatches<br>
The delta %SR over no enzyme control was determined using the following formula:<br>

BPN' Y217L was compared to nprE on EMPA 1 16 (BMI), at pH values of 6.7, 7.5, 8.5, and 9.5. The performance of nprE on EMPA 116 appeared to peak at about pH 8, while the performance of BPN' Y217L peaked at about pH 8.8. The results showed that nprE performed better than BPN' Y217L at pH 7.5 and 8.5, although it does not perform as well as BPN' Y217L<br>
at pH 6.7. The performance of these enzymes was equal at pH 9.5. In addition, there was no difference in the performance of these enzymes on Equest grass (med) at pH 7.8-8.4.<br>
EXAMPLE 16 Comparison of PMN and nprE Enzymes in Liquid Detergent<br>
This Example describes cleaning experiments to determine the cleaning performance of PMN and nprE. The cleaning performance of PMN and nprE enzymes were tested in Liquid TIDE® detergent in comparison with a benchmark serine'protease (Protease A) on protease sensitive stains.  As shown in the table below, PMN and nprE remove stains much better than protease A, even at low enzyme levels.

EXAMPLE 17 Thermostability of NprE and NprE Variants<br>
In this Example, experiments conducted to determine the thermostability of NprE and NprE variants are described. The enzymes were produced and purified as described above. The purified proteins were judged to be sufficiently homogenous, with greater than 95% purity as determined using 10% SDS-PAGE, as only one major protein was observed in the gel. This protein was approximately 32 kDa, which is the molecular weight of the mature nprE sequence. The protein was formulated for storage using the 25 mM MES buffer, pH 5.8, containing 1 mM zinc chloride, 4 mM calcium chloride, and 40 % propylene glycol. The assays used in these experiments were the protease assay using fluorescence AGLA activity described above and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), described below.<br>
Differential Scanning Calorimetrv (DSC)<br>
Excessive heat capacity curves were measured using an ultrasensitive scanning high throughput microcalorimeter VP-Cap DSC (Microcal). The standard procedure for DSC measurements and the theory of the technique is well known to those of skill in the art (See e.g.,<br>
Freire, 1995) Meth. Mol. Biol., 41,191-218 [1995]). Briefly, approx. 500 uL of 200-400 ppm pure or ultrafiltrate concentrate (UFC) protein samples were needed. Typically, 400 ppm of NprE and the variant proteins (in the absence and presence 130 mM citrate) were scanned over 20-l00 °C temperature range using a scan rate of 200 °C/hr in 5 mM HEPES, pH 8.0 buffer. The same sample was then rescanned to check the reversibility of the process. For NprE, the thermal unfolding process was irreversible. Scan rate dependence data of the thermal melting for NprE was assessed over a scan rate of 25 to 200°C/hr. The effect of various additives (e.g., primary and secondary alcohols, salts, cyclodextrin, PEG, sorbitol, glycerol) on the thermal melting point of NprE was also assessed.<br>
The thermal stability of wild-type NprE was determined at two different concentrations, in order to show the effect of protein concentration on the thermal melting point. The Tm values for 220 ppm and 440 ppm were determined to be 67.6 ± 0.5 and 69.2 ± 0.5 °C, respectively. The protein concentration effect highlights a second-order event It is contemplated that this is either aggregation or autolysis. However, it is not intended that the present invention be limited to any particular mechanism. Nonetheless, these results indicate that for an accurate determination and any comparison of thermal melting points for NprE require that the protein concentrations be well matched. The effect of the scan rate on the thermal melting point also showed a dependence where the Tm was dependent on the scan rate up to 150 0C/hr, and then leveled off between 150-200 °C/hr. Based on these results, 200 °C/hr was selected as the upper scan rate for all studies to.<br>
\		.<br>
minimize the dependence of the Tm on scan rate.<br>
All data collected for NprE and variants are shown in Table 4. Table 4 also includes the DSC thermal melting points obtained for NprE and variants in the presence of 130 mM citrate. In most cases, two protein concentrations were scanned. As indicated in this Table, in the case of the scans in the-presence of 130 mM citrate not all proteins showed a thermal unfolding profile.<br>
Table 17. DSC Results<br>
(Table Removed ) <br>
A representative Figure of the thermal unfolding profiles (DSC scans) for wild type and various mutants of NprE are shown in Figure 27. The unfolding profiles indicate the wild-type midpoint and show selective mutants that display increased thermal melting points relative to wild-type and those that display decreased melting points relative to wild-type. This Figure clearly highlights that the DSC distinguished between stable and less stable NprE variants, and is useful as a secondary screen. A general trend is observed between the thermal melting points of the variants and their stability in detergent. For example, the variants S66E, S199E, D220P/E, S129I/V are all winners in TIDE® and show an approximate 1 °C increase in thermal melting point relative to wild type NprE. This 1 °C increase in thermal melting point is small yet significant, as thermal stability typically requires multiple amino acid substitutions.<br>
Figure 28 shows the thermal unfolding of NprE variants that display a thermal unfolding profile in the presence of 130 mM citrate. Citrate is a detergent component that rapidly causes the autolysis of NprE, in the absence of calcium. For wild-type NprE, there is no thermal unfolding profile in the presence of citrate, which is consistent with a protein that is already Unfolded or lacks a well-formed hydrophobia core. Mutants that display a thermal unfolding profile in the presence of citrate are included in Table 17. These variants have thermal melting points in the range of 47- 56 °C. The DSC scans in the presence of 130 mM citrate indicated variants that are more stable than wild-type NprE to citrate. For example, citrate-stable variants are show to contain either S129I or S129V and combinatorials containing either of these substitutions show a + 5°C increase in thermal melting point.<br>
Effect of Additives on the Thermal Melting Points of NprE:<br>
Figure 29 shows the results of experiments including various additives. The buffer was 5 mM HEPES, pH 8.0. The samples were scanned from 20 -100 °C using a scan rate of 200°C/hr. In this Figure, the horizontal line represents the Tm for wild-type NprE with no additive. In these experiments, the data showed little or no effect on the thermal melting point (Tm) of NprE in the presence of these reagents. The inclusion of an inhibitor of NprE activity, namely phosphoramidon, was shown to increase the Tm by approx. 1°C, suggesting that the inhibitor may impart some stabilization to NprE against the thermal unfolding process. None of the<br>
conditions above assisted in making the thermal unfolding process reversible. However, it is not intended that the present invention be limited to any particular mechanism.<br>

To determine the wash performance of these homologues in TIDE®, one pre-washed BMI microswatch was first added into each well of a 96-well plate. Then, 190ul of Ix compact TIDE® (780ug/ml compact TIDE®, 5mM HEPES, pH8, 6gpg water hardness) were added. Then, lOul of purified NprE, Bacillus subtilis NprE, Bacillus thuringiensis NprB and Bacillus thermoproteolyticus thermolysin were added to the wells to produce a final enzyme concentration is 0.25ug/ml. The plate was incubated at 25°C for 30mins with shaking at 1400rpm on Thermomixer. At the end of incubation, l00ul of supernatant were transferred into a new 96-well plate. The OD at 405nm of supernatant was then measured. The supernatant OD was subtracted with the OD of a blank control without enzyme addition. The performance index was calculated by dividing the OD of each homologue to the OD of NprE. Figure 31 provides a graph showing the BMI was performance of NprE, as well as the nprE homologs described herein.<br>
EXAMPLE 19 Metal Analysis of Wild-Type nprE and Variants<br>
In this Example, experiments conducted to determine the zinc and calcium content of nprE and nprE variants are described. In these experiments, total trace metal analysis by inductively coupled plasma - mass spectrometry (ICPMS) and particle induced X-ray emission with a microfocused beam (micro-PIXE) were performed to confirm the zinc and calcium content of NprE. Overall, one zinc and two calcium ions are tightly bound.<br>
All ICPMS and micro-PIXE samples were prepared in metal free buffer to remove any exogenous metal contaminants. Typically, 250 uL of 40 mg/mL NprE samples were buffer exchanged three times with 20 mM HEPES, pH 8.2 using YM-10 microdialysis apparatus. Metal free buffer was generated by passing the buffer through a column packed with Chelax 100 resin. The final protein concentration was determined using Bicinchoninic acid protein determination assay kit (BCA assay) from Sigma. ICPMS samples were analyzed at the West Coast Analytical Services, Inc. Micro-PIXE samples were analyzed at the Ion Beam Analysis Laboratory.<br>
Table 19-1 shows ICPMS metal analysis results for calcium and zinc ions from NprE wild type. Relative to protein concentration, two calcium ions and two zinc ions were found to be present in the sample.     (Table Removed ) <br>
The MicroPKE elemental composition analysis plot measured the metal contents relative to a protein internal standard. All peaks detected using Micro-PEXE were calculated<br>
relative to the sulfur peak arising from three methionines in the case of NprE. An observed large chloride ion peak was due to the presence of salt in buffer.<br>
Table 18-2 shows the metal content determined by Micro-PIXE, which indicates that in general, NprE contains two tightly bound calcium and one zinc ion per protein molecule. Wild type NprE showed 1 zinc ion with 2 calcium ions. It is contemplated that calcium ions may have shown a low occupancy rate due to preparation of the sample. S58D and T60D showed close to two zinc ions per protein indicating a possible extra zinc ion binding to the site. The double variant has two added cysteines adding the accuracy of the technique. However, it is not intended that the present invention be limited to any particular embodiment with a specific number of ions.    <br>

Consistent with other well-characterized calcium and zinc dependent neutral proteases such as thermolysin or thermolysin-like proteases (TLPsX-Se* e.g., Dahlquist et ol., Biochem., 15:1103-1111 [1976]; Srpingman et al, (1995) Biochemistry 34,15713-15720 [1995]; and Willenbrock el al., (1995) FEES Lett. 358:189-192 [1995]), NprE was found to contain at least two tightly bound calcium ions and one zinc ion per molecule. A potential third calcium binding site is proposed but expected to be very weak. Since all samples were desalted to remove any exogenous metals, these weakly bounding calcium sites are expected to be unoccupied.<br>

Stabilizing NprE with Calcium Formate in TIDE® Compact HDL Detergent<br>
In this Example, experiments conducted to develop means to stabilize NprE in TIDE® compact HDL detergent are described. In these experiments, means to stabilize NprE by increasing the calcium formate level at a fixed citrate concentration while lowering DTPA content in experimental TIDE® compact formulation ('TIDE® 2x") were investigated. A statistical design of experiments (DOE) methodology was used in order to simplify the . experiments as well as data analyses. It was shown that DTPA present in TIDE® adversely affects NprE stability, while addition of calcium formate helps overcome the detrimental effect in the full strength TIDE® compact formulation.<br>
A full central composite response surface model with duplicate center points was used as a DOE method. A total of 16 unique formulations varying four components were pre-made according to the composition variations listed in Table 19.1. LAS was varied from 0-6% (w/w) with DTPA (0 - 0.25%) and calcium-formate (0 - 0.2%) at a fixed concentration of citric acid (1.9%). All other components of the TIDE® detergent were held constant. The component concentration boundary conditions were determined based on phase stability of the various mixes. The protein stability tests were conducted with 780 ppm nprE in the full strength (~ 100%) formulation mixes and incubated at 32 °C. Inactivation was measured up to 24 hours. All assays were done using red fluorescent labeled casein assay kit (Invitrogen) with 0.5 ppm protein concentration. Rates of NprE inactivation were measured in three independent experiments. DOE data were analyzed using DOE Fusion Pro (S-Matrix).<br>

Table 20.2 and Figure 31 show the results of NprE stability measurements in various formulation mixes. Average rates and the standard deviation were the averaged NprE inactivation rate (hour"1) from three independent measurements. Qualitatively, fonnulations with low DTPA content with high calcium load tend to be more stable in the full strength compact TIDE®. As an example, Formulation #5, with no addition of DTPA and high calcium formate level showed the lowest inactivation rate, indicating high NprE stability. In contrast, Formulation #9, with high DTPA concentration with no added calcium formate showed lowest stability. In Table 20.2, the ranking is based on measured stability (Le., averaged rates).  Runs are from three independent stability experiments.<br>

Figure 33 shows NprE inactivation effects by DTPA at varying levels of fixed calcium formate concentration. Panel A shows rate of NprE inactivation by DTPA without any added calcium formate. The correlation shows that DTPA has significant detrimental effect. Panel B shows some decreased effect of DTPA with 0.1% calcium formate. Panel C shows significantly decreased effect of DTPA with 0.2% calcium formate.<br>
Figure 34 shows DOE analysis software (Fusion Pro) generated prediction profile of DTPA and calcium formate composition based on response goal (decay rate) of less than 0.5 hr*1<br>
(Panel A), 0.25 hf' (Panel B) and 0.05 hr'1 (Panel C). The shaded areas indicate DTPA and<br>
calcium formate composition ratios that are predicted to show stability with decay rate below the set goal. For example, 0.16% calcium formate in the presence of 0.04% DTPA would provide NprE stability with decay rate of less than 0.25 hour"1 as shown in Panel B of Figure 34. On the other hand, 0.08% calcium formate cannot sustain NprE stability with decay rate of at least 0.25 hour"1 in the presence of 0.16% DTPA.<br>

Identification of the Citrate-induced Autolvtic Sites for B. amyloliquefaciens Neutral<br>
Metalloprotease NprE<br>
In this Example, methods used to assess the citrate-induced autolysis of wild-type and recombinant variant nprE (e.g., B. subtilis variant) are described.  In these experiments, autolysis of the neutral metalloprotease from B. amyloliquefaciens (natural and the recombinant variant expressed in B. subtilis') was induced using sodium citrate (Sigma). The autolysis process was controlled by performing the reaction at 4°C in 25 mM MES, pH 6.5, buffer. In these experiments, the autolysis of 0.4 mg/ml NprE was optimized by varying either: (a) the time of incubation (10-100 minutes) in 10 mM citrate; or (b) the citrate concentration (10-100 mM) over 100 minutes. A control of neutral metalloprotease diluted in buffer alone (i.e., no citrate) was incubated under similar conditions. The autolytic reactions were terminated by addition of an equal volume of IN HC1, the samples were precipitated using TCA and the pellet was washed and dried using acetone. The resultant pellet was resuspended in 20 uL buffer, pH 6.5, and 4X LDS sample buffer (NuPage, Invitrogen)<br>
The autolytic fragments were resolved by 10 % (w/v) SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto a PVDF membrane. The first 10 amino acid residues were sequenced by Edman degradation (Argo Bioanalytica). The partial amino acid sequences of the autolytic fragments were determined using trypsin in-gel digestion and analyzed using LCQ-MS (Agilent). The in-gel digestion process involved macerating the gel piece that contained the protein, removal of the Coomassie blue stain followed by re-hydration of the gel pieces in 25 mM NH^COs containing 2 M urea. Trypsin was added to the re-hydrated gel pieces for approx. 6 hours at 37 °C. Following the digestion, the peptides were extracted using acetonitrile and TCA. The peptides were separated on a C4-hydrophobic column (Vydac) using an acetonitrile- water gradient The<br>
resultant peptide maps were searched with the SEQUEST® database search program against a database containing Genencor enzymes.<br>
The amino acid sequences of the first 10 amino acids of each of the fragments were compared with the known amino acid sequence for B. amyloliquefaciens NprE. This enabled the identification of the amino acid at the N-termini and hence the cleavage site(s).<br>
The generation of the citrate-induced fragments and their resolution was shown on 10 % SDS-PAGE. The sizes of the fragments were identified using a standard molecular weight marker from Invitrogen. In the presence of 10 mM citrate, two fragments in addition to remaining intact NprE were observed over the 100 minute time range. The two fragments formed at the low citrate concentration were found to be 24 kDa and 9 kDa in size. The intact nprE is 32 kDa. The 100-minute time range results in a good proportion of cleaved protein (i.e., the primary autolysis fragments). No additional fragments were observed or detected under these conditions. A study over 100 minutes in the presence of increasing citrate was performed to obtain the secondary autolytic fragments. In this experiment, when concentrations between 10 -30 mM citrate were used, the two fragments described above were observed. At 40 mM citrate, less of the larger 24-kDa fragments were apparent however a 15-kDa fragment was also apparent Between 50 -100 mM citrate, the 24 kDa fragment and the'9-kDa fragments were no longer detected but three other fragments, of sizes 21 kDa, 15 kDa and 11 kDa, were observed.<br>
The identity of the N-termini of the 24 kDa, 9 kDa (first two fragments), and the 21 kDa, 15 kDa and 11 kDa (the next autolytic fragments) were determined using Edman degradation (Argo Bioanalytica).  <br>
Table 21. N-Termina) Sequence of Fragments     .     (Table Removed )  <br>
Bands Al, A 3 and A4 have the native N-terminal sequence that matches the N-terminus for the intact NprE. The sequencing report for Band A2 showed three fragments where the least intense sequence appeared to be identical to the more intense sequence, except that it was two residues and one residue shorter than the more intense sequences, respectively. This was .consistent with a fraying of that particular protein fragment. The pattern and the sizes of the gel fragments suggest that the 15 kDa (Band A4) may be derived from the 21-kDa fragment (Band A3) and hence the C-terminus is deduced to be at or near position 198. However, it is not intended that the present invention be limited to this particular embodiment.<br>
Figure 35 provides the amino acid sequences for the various fragments (1-5 or Al-5 for N-terminal sequencing purposes). Fragment 1 (Al) has the N-terminal residues equivalent to that for the intact native protein (SEQ ID NO:222), fragment 2 (Ad2) N-terminus starts at or near D220 (SEQ ID NO:223). The following two amino acid residues (A221 and G222) are also highlighted because this fragment was identified as being frayed. Fragment 3 (A3) (SEQ ID NO:224) and fragment 4 (A4) (SEQ ID NO:225) have the N-terminus of the intact protein, and fragment 5 (A5) (SEQ I DNO:226) starts at LI 98, The C-terminus of fragment 4 is likely to be at or near Ml 38 (based on the size difference between A3 and A4). The corresponding fragment for A3 was not detected.<br>
Trypsin digestion followed by LCQ-MS of the peptide maps for fragments 1 through 5 positively identified several amino acid peptides within the respective fragments. These are highlighted in Figure 35. The LCQ-MS provided a positive control for the identity of the fragments.<br>
Based on the N-terminal and LCQ-MS analysis of the cleavage fragments, primary cleavage sites were identified at amino acid positions D220, A221, G222, Ml 38, and L198. These sites were targeted using site-directed mutagenesis and site-evaluation libraries of D220, A221, G222, L198, and M138, D139 were created. The mutant proteins were screened for increasing stability in detergent and for BMI-wash performance, as indicated hereia In some instances, the amino acids alongside these sites were also selected for protein engineering, in • order to ensure that the clip site was indeed targeted.<br>
The protein engineering results clearly indicated that amino acid substitutions of either Pro or GIu at D220 generated an NprE molecule that is more stable in detergent In addition, additional stability was afforded to the NprE molecule by replacing G222 with Cys, and M138 with either He or Leu. In general, these specific amino acid substitutions provided the NprE with detergent stability advantages without the BMI-wash performance being compromised. Thus, these experiments provide important mapping data for the citrate-induced autolysis sites, facilitating the identification of key amino acid residues that alter and affect the overall stability of NprE. Citrate (a builder added to detergent matrices) destabilizes and autolyses NprE and is suggested to do so by cbelating the essential calcium-bound atoms. The application of NprE in extreme detergent conditions requires that a more stable NprE molecule be used in these settings. In these experiments, substitutions of one or more of the autolytic sites of NprE have resulted in a more detergent-stable nprE molecule for use in these extreme detergents.<br>
