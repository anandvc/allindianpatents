A   PROCESS   FOR   THE   PREPARATION   OF   THIOXANTHONES Technical field of the invention<br>
The invention relates to a process for the preparation of thioxanthen-9-one derivatives, of the following thioxanthones, of the Formula 1.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Thioxanthones are useful intermediates for the preparation of pharmaceuticals<br>
in the field of psychoterapeutics.<br>
Another important use is as activators or sensitizers in the photopolymerisation<br>
of ethylenically unsaturated monomers.<br>
Basically thioxanthones are formed by cyclisation of 2-phenylthiobenzoic acid<br>
derivatives. As described by Smiles, J. Chem. Soc. (1911), 99, 645, this reaction can<br>
be performed in one step, by reacting 2,2'-dithiodibenzoic acid with an aromatic<br>
compound in sulittric acid. This invention has been the most utilised for producing<br>
thioxanthones in an industrial scale.<br>
The main drawbacks of the process is that yields are poor, 40 - 60%, a large excess<br>
of sulfur ic acid must be used, after reaction a large amount of diluted sulfuric acid<br>
has to be regenerated or disposed. Sulfonated aromatics are major biproducts.<br>
For that reason 2-chlorothiobenzoyl chloride (CTBC) or derivatives hereof has been<br>
considered as an obvious choice for a Friedel-Craft type reaction to form<br>
thioxanthones. This reaction is first revealed in patent US4101558 where<br>
2-chlorotbiobenzoyl - and 5-chloro-2-chlorobenzoyl chloride is reacted with<br>
benzene and chlorobenzene to form thioxanthone, 7-chlorothioxanthone and<br>
2,7-dichlorothioxanthone with aluminium chloride as catalyst.<br><br>
2<br>
In the examples of preparation, CTBC and the aromatic substrate are mixed in a suitable solvent and aluminium chloride is added in small portions giving rise to product yields from 70-91%. The patent claims do not specify in which order the Friedel-Craft catalyst and the two reactants are brought together. Belleau et al, Synth. Commun., (1983), 13, 977 - 984, have investigated different types of Lewis acids as catalyst to form thioxanthones from CTBC and ortho-/para-xylene or 1,4-dimethoxy substituted aromatic substrates. They found that in this case of activated aromatic substrates tin(IV)chloride was the most effective catalyst. The experimental section describes that CTBC in a chlorinated solvent is mixed with tin(TV) chloride, where after the substrate is added in one portion.<br>
Disclosure of invention<br>
It is an object of this invention to provide a facile process for the preparation<br>
of thioxanthones, specially 2-isopropyl- and 2-chlorothioxanthone in commercial<br>
quantities, good yield and high purity.<br>
To avoid the problems connected to the method using sulfuric acid as medium for<br>
reaction of 2,2'-dithiodibenzoic acid with an aromatic substrate, the reaction<br>
between CTBC and an aromatic substrate under Friedel-Craft conditions were<br>
pursued according to Reaction Schemel<br><br><br>
3<br>
CTBC is prepared by known methods where 2,2'-dithiodibenzoic acid or substituted<br>
derivatives hereof is transformed to the acid chloride by reaction with thionyl<br>
chloride or a similar reagent. The reaction is facilitated by using thionyl chloride as<br>
solvent and addition of a catalyst of the amide type like dimethylformamide or<br>
N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinoiL The acid chloride is chlorinated with chlorine or suliuryl<br>
chloride revealing CTBC.<br>
As CTBC where R1 = R2 = H also is an important starting material for the industrial<br>
production of the biocide, l,2-benzisothiazolin-3-one, investigations were done for<br>
purification of CTBC. Even the literature does not disclose examples of distilling the<br>
product, it was shown that this could be done by a vacuum distillation at, 165 - 170°C<br>
and 10 mm Hg, giving a light yellow product with rn.p. 67 -68°C, from the brown<br>
crude starting material. CTBC was found to be heat sensitive by prolonged heating to<br>
about 200°C. To avoid decomposition in industrial scale, distillation should<br>
preferably be performed under mild conditions like falling- or wiped film<br>
evaporations.<br>
Experiments with CTBC wherein R1 = R2 - H and substrate isopropylbenzene<br>
(cumene) wherein R3 = i-C3H7, R4 =: R5 = H in 1,2-dichloroetnane (DCE) as solvent<br>
and aluminium chloride as catalyst, were performed according to the conditions in<br>
US4101558.<br>
The content of isomers 2- and 4-isopropylthioxanthone in the organic phase were<br>
found to be 70% of theory, by HPLC, and 50% as isolated yield.<br>
The reaction could not be performed as described by Belleau et al. as CTBC<br>
disproportionated with aluminium chloride in DCE.<br>
Using the substrate, cumene, as solvent with aluminium chloride and adding<br>
CTBC to the slurry gave rise to formation of an insoluble compound, which<br>
probably is a reaction product from 1 mole CTBC with 2 moles cumene.<br>
Surprisingly it turned out that the reaction could be performed if a mixture<br>
of CTBC and cumene, with a small molar excess of cumene, in DCE, were added<br>
to a slurry of aluminium chloride, in small molar excess, and DCE. After water<br>
quench the total yield of 2- and 4-thioxanthone isomers in the organic phase were<br>
89% of theory, by calibrated HPLC.<br>
By performing the process in the described way handling aluminium chloride<br><br>
4<br>
in industrial scale has been facilitated, as the catalyst has not to be added during the<br>
process.<br>
The process has been extended to thioxanthones, according to Reaction Scheme 1,<br>
where R1 is different from, or equals R2 both are represented by hydrogen, chlorine,<br>
bromine, alkyl, aryl and alkoxy radicals having 1 to 8 carbon atoms. R3.R4 and R5<br>
can equals one another by pair or all three, or be different and be represented by<br>
hydrogen, chlorine, bromine, hydroxyl, alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, alkoxy,<br>
alkylcarbonylalkoxy, carbonylalkyl, carbonylalkoxy, carbamido<br>
or R3 and R4 can form a 5, 6 or seven member ring fused to the aromatic ring.<br>
R3,R4 and R5 can be radicals having 1 to 10 carbon atoms. Specific types of<br>
substituted thioxanthone are 2-chloro, 4-chloro, 2-bromo, 4-bromo, 2,7-dichloro, 2-<br>
hydroxy, 2-methyl, 4-methyl, 2,4-diethyl, 2-isopropyl, 2-carboethoxymethyl. The<br>
aromatic compound may include polynuclear aromatic compounds as biphenyl as<br>
naphthalene.<br>
The process is carried out in an organic solvent which are particularly known to be<br>
useful for Friedel-Craft reaction such as methylene chloride, 1,2-dichloroethane,<br>
1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane, etc.<br>
To perform the reaction, known Friedel-Craft catalyst as aluminium chloride,<br>
aluminium bromide, iron (HI) chloride, tin(II) chloride, tin(IV) chloride,<br>
iron(III) chloride can be used. Specially aluminium chloride.<br>
The reaction may preferably be carried out using substitutet or unsubstitutet<br>
CTBC : aromatic substrate : Friedel-Craft catalyst in the molar ratio<br>
1:1:1-1:20:5. The molar ratio of said components is particularly<br>
advantageously as 1 :1,2 : 1,6.<br>
The reaction may be performed at a temperature between 0°C and 80°C.<br>
Preferably 25°C.<br>
The method of isolating the thioxanthones from the organic reaction media may<br>
vary depending on the physical and chemical nature of the product. If the complex<br>
between the product and aluminium chloride is sparingly soluble, it can be an<br>
advantage to isolate the complex before decomposition. Preferably decomposition<br>
of the complex can be accomplished by adding the reaction mixture to water,<br>
diluted mineral acid or aqueous solutions of alkaline hydroxides like sodium,<br>
potassium, barium or calcium. The choice of decomposition medium depends on<br><br>
5<br>
the base or acid nature of the product and of insoluble by-products, keeping the product in the organic phase and by-products in the water phase. Crude thioxanthones are isolated by evaporation of the solvent, and if necessary purified by methods as crystallisation, chromatographi etc. Examples<br>
Reaction mixtures and products were analysed by HPLC chromatographi. Specific compounds were characterised by comparison with authentic samples. HPLC conditions:<br><br>
