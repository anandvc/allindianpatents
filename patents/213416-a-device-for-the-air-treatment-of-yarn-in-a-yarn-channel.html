FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The invention refers to a device for the air treatment of thread in a thread passage, which is assembled at least partly in a movable nozzle plate, in doing so the device has a fork shaped solid trestle with upper and lower beam as well as a spring tension and the nozzle plate by means of a sliding lever may be brought in an open threading position as well as in a closed operating position.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
Devices for the air treatment of thread as for example turbulence nozzles and air blast texturing nozzles are known now a days under the technical concept "Slide-Jet". A Slide-Jet as for example EPO 851945 comprises functionally four core components;<br>
-	a nozzle ptate with open thread passage<br>
-	a spring for the pressing of baffle plate on the nozzle plate,<br>
-	a trestle type structured housing<br>
-	as well as a controllable air connection<br>
The housing comprises a solid beam frame or rather trestle in which through a switch movement of a sliding lever the nozzle plate can be shifted to and fro under spring pressure and the device can be brought in an operating position or a threading position. With the sliding movement at the same time the air is released or closed. With the constructive design of a Slide-Jet nozzle two basic requirements must be fulfilled.<br>
-	First for the function compressed air valve for the release or closing<br>
of the air supply the sealing parts movable relative to each other<br>
must be moved under a sufficient pressure, so that in no way<br>
through leaking positions compressed air losses arise.<br><br>
-2-<br>
The second basic requirement comes from the thread treatment process. The thread treatment takes place primarily in the thread passage. The thread passage is built at one hand through a nozzle plate with the air supply and on the other hand through an oppositely lying baffle plate. For the change over from the operating position to the threading position the baffle plate is moved relative to the nozzle plate. It Is required that no gap arises between baffle plate and nozzle plate. A side wise gap involves the danger of a dust accumulation and with it a deterioration of the operating conditions. Individual filaments can get caught in a gap and can tear as a result.<br>
For both the basic requirements the parts movable relative to each other are pressed on each other through a compression spring. This requires a correspondingly strong sliding lever or rather a powerful manual engagement in order to bring the sliding lever from one position to the other. The described change over from the operating position to the threading position is very reliable and is used now a days as standard solution. The nozzle plate must be dismantled and re-mounted from time to time, be it for the purpose of cleaning the nozzle plate or for the purpose of inserting another nozzle plate. In case of nozzle plates in metal, the wear out is substantial through continuous run of thread. Higher is the thread transport speed and greater is the thread tension, particularly in turbulence nozzles, so faster must the nozzle plates be replaced. The replacement takes place in the state of the art through it, that by means of a special face spanner functionally the spring tension force for the mounting as welt as for the dismantling is neutralized.<br>
With the W003/069036 a solution has been known in which in place of a solid trestle a correspondingly structured plastic body is used. In place of a genuine spring the elasticity of plastic trestle is utilized. Therein a difficult mounting and dismantling of the nozzle plates as well as a poorly definable and relatively small contact force and on a long term basis loss of tension force as typical property of plastic are disadvantageous.<br><br>
-3-<br>
OBJECT OF INVENTION<br>
It is therefore the object of the invention to improve the control function threading position and operating position in relation to the change of nozzle plates as well as in relation to the optimizing of the spring pressure however, in such a way that the advantages of the solutions of the state of the art do not get<br>
lost.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The solution as per the invention Is marked through it that it shows an integrated detaching help with power transmission for the neutralization of the spring pressure. It has been Identified by the inventor that an extra spanner has in fact the advantage that in no actuating position the spring tension is neutralized untntentionatiy however it brings different disadvantages. It is true that in proportion to smallness of the air treatment device a relatively large spring tension force Is required for the previously mentioned basic functions. The practical case has shown that the compression spring over 100N will bring up preferably 120-200N tension force with it the required functions are really fulfilled and above all the baffle plate lies always clean in the operation independent of the actuating position.<br>
For many people with bare fingers, it is difficult to neutralize such a spring tension force without additional lever help, in order to take out the nozzle plate from the device or rather to mount it again in the device unhindered. In the state of the art the fact was fully over looked that the detaching way lies only in the order of the magnitude of about one millimeter. This means that the function<br><br>
-4-<br>
spanner as per invention through a designwise relatively small detaching lever help with gearing is completely fulfilled in doing so the detaching help itself can also take over the transmission of spriing pressure. With it an extra inserting type spanner from out side for each changing process Is dispensed with and makes the corresponding working procedure enormously easy. The integrated detaching help can be conveived in different ways. A core idea of the new solution lies therein that the detaching help remains permanently at the device. A detaching lever can be brought up internally as well as externally at the device. The best solution is presently seen in an integration in the inside of the device.<br>
Specially in way of advantage a spring tension lever in the proximity of the nozzle plate Is pivot rested as shorter lever in doing so the spring pressure is brought up in the oppositely set some what longer lever part. The spring tension lever has therein the advantage that for the spring pressure a transmission of the power is given. The spring pressure is transmitted as in the state of the art over a baffle plate on the nozzle plate, in doing so in the threading position the sliding part or rather the nozzle plate after neutralization of the spring pressure is easily removable over the baffle plate from the device.<br>
The spring tension lever as per a first design way can be extended out for a manual operation with a lever part oppositely set to the baffle plate over the application position of the compression spring. An additional manual operation lever to be operated from outside is allocated to the detaching lever with which over an additional gearing the required force for the neutralization of the spring force is reduced with a finger. With it even in case of a relatively strong compression spring with less operating force as for example with the thumb, the<br><br>
-5-<br>
spring force on the nozzte plate is neutralized and these are taken out from the device. The detaching lever is structured preferably disk type and is assembled inside of the device in doing so the baffle plate with minor compliance is hinged to the detaching fever. The baffle plate is elastically carried along with the detaching movement of the detaching lever, in such way that the baffle plate by operation of the detaching lever opens itself widened slightly conically. This makes easy the introduction of the nozzle plate or rather of the sliding part because a slightly conically widened slip-in opening is formed.<br>
The device shows a trestle structured as fork shaped beam frames. The trestle is open towards front in direction of the thread passage and has an upper as well as a lower beam in doing so the lower beam has slide ways as well as a compressed air connection and the upper beam has the bearing seat for the sliding lever as well as also for the detaching lever. Advantageously the upper beam is structured out of two parallel beam walls, in doing so the detaching lever and the sliding lever are assembled between both beam walls. The detaching lever is designed as thin metal plate and sidewise with sliding plates are led between the two beam walls.<br>
This means that the parts loaded with high forces an be produced out of metal and the less or almost not loaded parts can be produced out of metal and the less or almost not loaded parts can be produced out of plastic and permit a light and cost effective manufacture. The control function in this design with extended detaching lever for the threading-as well as operating position is mechanically fully separated from the function detaching of the spring pressure or rather taking out of the nozzle plate from the device.<br><br>
-6-<br>
As per a second specially advantageous design concept of the invention the sliding lever is part of the detaching help in such a way that be means of the sliding lever the sliding movement as well as the neutralization of the spring pressure may be carried out in power transmitted condition.<br>
Preferably the operation of the sliding lever covers two areas, a first area for the sliding movement and a second area for a detaching movement.<br>
The great advantage of this solution lies therein that the contacting of the baffle plate at the nozzle plate is exactly definable in every relation. In the closed operating position contact force is in full extent. This is valid advantageously also during the sliding movement while the thread lies in the thread passage and Is drawn mostly with the transport speed through the thread passage. In case the thread passage is open, the contact force can be neutralized fully without disadvantage and the baffle plate can be removed for the easy change of the nozzle plate.<br>
As per a further design the sliding tever shows at it's rotational axle a detaching cam or detaching eccentric. With the engagement in the spring tension Sever, through the operation of the sliding lever the spring pressure is neutralized. Further the detaching eccentric can be structured in such way that in case of operation of the sliding lever the sliding movement for the nozzle plate as well as the neutralization of the spring pressure with inclusion of the removal of baffle plate from the nozzle plate may be co-ordinated, in doing so already during the sliding movement, the spring tension force is neutralized successively.<br><br>
-6a-<br>
Advantageously the baffle plate is pivot rested at the sliding lever, in all designs in such a way that with the detaching movement the baffle plate virtually opens the mouth" for the easy inclusion and exclusion of the sliding part. The nozzle plate can be assembled as changing part inside of the sliding part, in doing so the sliding lever engages in the sliding part over a lock-in pin and releases in the threading position the mechanical sliding engagement. This permits the detaching lever to operate independent of the position of the sliding lever, so that at one side the operation of detaching lever makes the control movement of the sliding lever easy and on the other side in the threading position the nozzle plate or rather the sliding part may be taken out.<br>

DETAIL DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF THE<br>
The Figure 1 shows a section through a device of the first solution way to air treatment of thread in doing so a part of the housing 1 and above all the sliding lever is left out. With it clearly the movement function of the new solution can be represented. From housing 1 only the lower beam 2 is represented. The upper beam 3 (Figure 5) is left out. A detaching lever 4 is pivot rested over a rotational<br><br>
-6C-<br>
axle 5 in upper beam 3 in doing so the rotational axle 5 is marked as circle with point in the center, in order to bring to term with it that the rotational axle 5 is stationary with the housing 1. In front part the detaching tever 4 shows an approximately circular shaped tab 6, which engages in a corresponding convex shape 7 of a baffle plate 8. (Figure 2b) The baffle plate 8 is held in the tab 6 over a hinged position 9 so that the baffle plate 8 has a minimum adaptability against a nozzle plate 10 (Figure 5) or rather of a plane nozzle plate surface 10 (Figure 3). The detaching lever 4 shows in relation to the rotational axle 5 a short lever arm KH as well as a long lever arm LH, through which a force transmission of as for example 1:3 for operation of the detaching tever 4 arises. The sliding lever 4 is at the same time also spring tension lever which is denoted with FSH. The length ration KH:FSH is from the shown example 1:2. With it the spring force FK of a compression spring 11 becomes double, which is entered With arrow 12 or rather<br><br>
7<br>
2FK in the Figure 1. This means that the baffle plate 8 presses with doubled spring pressure on the baffle plate 10.<br>
A result of the contact force of the baffle plate 8 on the nozzle plate 10 is that the nozzle plate 10 or rather the corresponding sliding part 13, in which the nozzle plate 10 is admitted, horizontally shifted with corresponding force, however cannot be taken out from the device. In the state of the art for this purpose the spring force was neutralized over a special spanner.<br>
The invention now proposes to achieve the detaching function over the  detaching lever 4 through a detaching force LK, in doing so the detaching force attacks at the long lever arm LH. The lever part 14 of the lever arm LH, yet represented extended for a manual operation (HB) is dashed and dotted. The lever gearing therein is even greater through the lever part 14 projecting towards outside. The execution example shown in Figure 1 is not only a compact design rather it permits with an additional manual operation lever 15 a further reduction of the required operating force for a manual operation. The manual operation lever 15 is held over a bolt 16 out of the upper beam 3 and can carry out corresponding to arrow 17 only a small tilting movement. The Figure 1 shows the situation with full effect of the spring force over the baffle plate 8 on the nozzle plate 10. At the right external end the detaching lever 4 has a circular segment shaped engaging position 18, which is additionally marked with a R. At the detaching lever 4 as mating part a compression area 19 is brought. It results from it that by pressing of manual operation lever 15 around the hinged position 16 the detaching lever is lowered down ward in the clockwise sense, the spring tension 'force' FH is neutralized and the force engagement of the baffle plate 8 on the nozzle plate 10 is detached, so that the nozzle plate 10 or rather the sliding part 13 can be taken out free from the device. In the figures 2a and 3 further yet a black marked rotational axle 20 is represented which like wise is fixed like the rotational axle 5 as well as the bolt 16 in the upper beam 3. At the rotational axle 20 a sliding lever 21 (Figures 4 and 5) are held. As it is executed yet in the following, through upward movement of the sliding lever 21 a lock-in pin22 can shift the sliding part 13 horizontally (Figure 1 to Figure 3) over a corresponding engaging recess 23. In the completely opened position or rather the threading position corresponding to Figure 5 the lock-in pin 22 releases the engagement, in doing so however further the spring force presses the baffle plate 8 on the nozzle plate 10.<br>
The Figure 2a shows the lock-in pin 22 in the open threading position and at the same time in a detaching position. The arrow 30 notifies that the manual operation<br><br>
8<br>
lever 15 is pressed till on stop at the housing 1. Therein the manual operation lever 15 has tilted slightly around the bolt 16 and over the engagement position 18 or rather the press area 19 has lifted the detaching lever together with the baffle plate 8, which is represented diagrammatically some what exaggerated. This is the situation for the release of the nozzle plate or rather of the sliding part in order to take it out fully from the device. The Figure 2a shows the withdrawal movement with a horizontal arrow 31. From the Figure 1 and 2 at the same time the air valve function is identifiable. In the Figure 1 the compressed air connection bore 32 in the lower beam 2 as well as the injection passage 33 in the sliding part match. In this position compressed air can be injected in the thread passage 44 over a blast air bore 34. In the Figure 2a both the bores 32, 33 are displaced (VL). The compressed air connection remains closed so long, as the spring force FK is effective on the nozzle plate 10. In the situation as per Figure 2a the compressed air must be shut off.<br>
The Figure 2b shows a cut-out magnification in relation to the baffle plate 8 or rather the tab 60. The cut-out shows an advantageous design of the detaching lever with two parallel guided and carried along sliding plate 36, to which a resilient tab part 35 is brought in. The resilient tab part 35 takes along in the opening and closing movement the baffle plate (Figure 2a).<br>
The Figure 3 shows with arrow 34 the complete taking out of the sliding part 13 from the device.<br>
Subsequently reference is taken on the Figures 4 and 5. The Figure 4 shows the closed operating position of a thread treatment device 40. Correspondingly the sliding lever is in the lowered position. The thread 41 runs through the thread passage, and holds a special structure be it a turbulence or a texturing as for example in the shape of thread under turbulence or a looping thread 41. Depending on specific thread treatment at the housing 1 or at the sliding lever 21, as represented in the Figure 4, thread guides 42 are brought in. In the Figure 4 additionally an air connection nipple 43 is shown. The Figures 4 and 5 correspond to the solution as per Figures 1 to 3.<br>
In the Figure 5 one identifies the detaching lever 4 as it is manufactured disk type, preferably out of steel. Compared with it, both the sliding plates 36 are manufactured out of plastic. Specially preferably the nozzle plate 10 as well as the baffle plates are manufactured in ceramic. The upper beam shows two parallel beam walls 3, 3' which in the center surround the flat detaching lever 4 as well as<br><br>
9<br>
two sliding plates preferably out of plastic. The Figure 5 shows at one hand the open threading position with the openly laid thread passage 44 and on the other hand the position for the start of the operation of the detaching lever as it is indicated with broken arrow 30.<br>
The Figures 6a and 6b show each in open or rather closed position an other design of the detaching lever 14, which corresponds to broken extension 14 in Figure 1. Through a force exerted from top to bottom corresponding to arrow HB, also here the detaching function can be carried out manually.<br>
The Figures 7a to 7f show the taking out of sliding parts. The Figure 7a corresponds to the Figure 4 and shows the closed operating position. The sliding lever is represented in lowered position of the thread passage 44 for the continuous run of the thread 41, 41* for an air treatment for which compressed air may be supplied over a connection 43 or rather a compressed air bore 32, 33 (Figure 1) Through the traps upward of the sliding lever 21 the sliding part 13 is pushed toward front (Figure 7b) and at the same time the air supply is shut off (Figure 2) which is managed with the shifting of both the compressed air supply bores 32, 33 around the dimension VL. Through pressing of a sliding lever 15 corresponding to arrow 30 the spring pressure force over the baffle plate is neutralized and the engagement of a sliding axle an engagement groove is released so that the sliding part 13 can be pushed freely towards front. The sliding part can now be taken out from the device (Figures 7d and 7e) and the nozzle plate 10 can be taken art from the sliding part 13. The remounting takes place in reverse sense of the Figures 7a to 7f.<br>
The Figures 8a to 8c show an execution example for the second solution way. The sliding movement is equally designed as in the first solution way. In the second solution way the sliding lever 21 at the same time is a part of the detaching help. In operation of the sliding lever 21 in the open threading position with a last area of sliding lever movement the spring force is neutralized and the baffle plate 8 is easily removed. The Figure 8a shows the device in the closed operation position. The spring tension lever 50 is rested over the rotational axle 5 and presses the baffle plate 8 on the nozzle plate 10 other the compression spring 11 in the anticlockwise way in the sense of spring force 2FK. In the Figure 8a there is a detaching cam 51 in the top most position and does not exist in any force engagement. The Figure 8b shows the sliding lever 21 in raised position, in doing so the sliding iever 21 was pressed upward around the rotational axle 20 corresponding to the angle a. The detaching cam 51 is already in contact with a<br><br>
10<br>
lower brace 52, which is part of the spring tension lever 50 and causes corresponding to arrow FKL a detaching force so that the spring force 2FK on the baffle plate 8 is neutralized. This is symbolically indicated with a gap 53. between the baffle plate 8 as well as the nozzle plate 10. The Figure 8c shows the sliding lever in the top most position. The detaching cam is in the lowest position and has pressed the spring tension lever 50 downward. With the angle |3, the easy removal of the baffle plate is indicated. In the position as per the Figures 8a, 8b and 8c the nozzle plate to or rather the sliding part 13 can be mounted or rather dismantled from the device without hindrance.<br>
The Figures 9a to 9c show an execution example which in place of a detaching cam 51 shows a detaching eccentric 54. The detaching eccentric has the advantage that the neutralization of the spring tension force and the removal of baffle plate 8 from the nozzle plate 10 can flowingly pass in each other. The sliding movement is with it at least depressurized As per a further thinking, through the mounting of a corresponding spring for the sliding lever a type of snap function can be assembled so that the sliding lever with spring force is pressed in both the end positions. This hinders that the lever is in an intermediate position, which corresponds neither to an open threading position nor to a closed operation position.<br>
The Figures 10a, 10b and 10c show a device with integrated thread guide 42 in a thread guide holder 45. Before the inlet or rather out let of the thread passage the thread in the examples of Figures 10a to 10c is anchored around 26°. The thread guide is brought in the sliding lever and moves along with the sliding lever movement.<br>
The Figures 11a to 11c show thread guide rollers 46 which are fastened to the housing 1 over holding plate 48 as well as screws 47. With larger anchoring anch. G. compared with the smaller anchoring anch. KL of Figure 11c also a smaller anchoring angle of as for exampie 11.7 is planned.<br>
A specially advantageous design thinking for all solutions lies therein that the service position is designed self impeding so that the position can not change from itself.<br><br>
