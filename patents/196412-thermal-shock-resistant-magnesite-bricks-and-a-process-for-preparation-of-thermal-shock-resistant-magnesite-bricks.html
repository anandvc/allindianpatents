				<td>ABSTRACT The invention in general relates to a Tliermal Shock Resistant Magnesite Bricks and a process of preparation of thermal shock resistant magnesite bricks which can be used in steel making furnaces, cement rotary kilns, glass melting furnaces, non-ferrous metal production etc. This invention provide a controlled process of preparation of magnesite bricks with high thermal shock resistance under high operating temperature having no disposal problem and without any environmental hazards. This process of preparation of magnesite brick consists of preparation of Dead Burnt Magnesite powder(DBM), and mixing of said DBM with additives and binders like Magnesium Sulphate or Mono-Aluminium phosphate - commercial grades in the preferred ratios. The quality of Additives, Binders and Dead Burnt Magnesites are tested prior to mixing. The DBM peas are crushed and graded into fine fractions of powder in the closed Mill House circuit and thereafter drawn into the IMT Counter current mixer through the load cell where it is mixed with desired quantities of additives, binders and water for a fixed duration. Then the mix is then shaped into bricks with programmable Hydraulic Friction Screw Press and then the bricks are dried at 150*c in Kilns and preheated gradually and fired at high temperature in accordance with pre-determined firing profile and then cooled at 100 °c. Then the bricks are then subjected to physical tests in order to attain the required physical and mechanical properties. These bricks are widely used in the sintering transition zones of Cement rotary kiln.</td>

This invention nefates to Thermal Stack Resistant Magnesite Bricks and to a process for preparation of Thermal Shock Resistant Magnesite Bricks.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
In steel making furnaces, cement rotary Wins, glass melting furnaces, non-femDus nvatal production etc., magnesite based bricks are used. The advantages of nnagnestte based brick is its high nr^ting poinl^ excellent chemical resistant, and non-toxic nature.<br>
In the currently known art, the nruiin disadvantages of magnesite bricks in use, is low thermal shock resistance of magnesite bricks. Conventionally the know art for improving the thermal shock resistance of magnesite bricks refracturing additives have been used, like chrome are, alumina and spinel.<br>
The Chrome are additive to Magnesite bricks, definitely improves the thermal-shock resistance. But simultaneously it leads to disposal problem for the used bricks due to hexa-valent chrome formation, which In turn residts In environnoentai hazard.<br>
The Alumina or spinel additives to magnesots bricks aiso improve the thermal shock resistance, but it reacts with clinker melts and destroys the microstructure.<br><br>
Also the brides made using the alumina and spinet additives cannot be used in higher operating temperatures.<br>
Pbjf ct of th« Inwntfon<br>
Arcordlngly the object of the invention is to provide a magnesite brick with hygh thermal shock resi^ance.<br>
It is another object of the invention to provide a magnesite brick which can be used in high operating temperature.<br>
It is another object of the invention to provide a magnesite brick which has no dls|x&gt;sal problem for the used bricks.<br>
It Is another object of the invention to provide a Magnesite brickds, which do not create any environmental hazards.<br>
It is another object of the invention to pnovide a magnesite brick, which does not react with ciirri<er-melts and thus interfere wi micro structure.></er-melts>
It is another objert of the invention, to resolve all the afbresaid disadvartoges in the prk&gt;r art, addittonalty use of r^ractory additives is being eliminated, instead formulate cost effective high thermal shock resistant magnesite bricks using the Dead Burnt Magnesite (DBM) with sonne additives.<br><br>
