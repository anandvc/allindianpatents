				<td>METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR CLASSIFYING USER MORPHOLOGY FOR EFFICIENT USE OF CELL PHONE SYSTEM<br>
RESOURCES<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Field<br>
[001] This application generally relates to wireless user equipment, such as wireless devices that use wireless signals to determine the location of devices such as cell phones.<br>
Background Information<br>
[002] Wireless cell phones have become almost universal in the modem world. The primary purpose of cell phones was, and still is, to provide wireless voice communication services. However, data communication is becoming increasingly important, and a host of additional features are being implemented in cell phones. [003] When adding features to a cell phone, the effect upon system performance must be considered. Additional features increase the load upon the cell phone's system, decreasing system performance.<br>
[004] The computing system of a cell phone is limited in size, capacity, and battery power. In order to make efficient use of its limited resources, the cell phone may communicate with other network resources using its communication capabilities; in other words, the cell phone may "off-load" some of its computationally intensive tasks to servers with much greater computation capabilities. For example, some position location functions may be performed by a dedicated server, such as a Position Determination Entity (PDE). To aid the location measurements, the PDE may provide assistance data to the cell phone. However, the assistance data is usually generalized for a wide range of conditions, and therefore imder some circumstances may not be useful, or just not fully optimized<br>
[005] Some cell phone operations are more efficiently performed by the cell phone, and still other functions must by necessity be performed by the cell phone itself. One such required function is actual position location data collection. In handset-based position location technologies, the wireless device carries out the fundamental location measurements. These position location operations can be particularly demanding upon<br><br>
system performance; for example, an attempted location fix may consume several seconds or more, during which time the phone's communication functionality may be diminished. Such periods of temporary diminished functionality can be very annoying and potentially disruptive to a user whose ability to make or receive a phone call during this period may be affected,<br>
[006] In all handset-based position location technologies, location measurements are made by the user equipment (UE). Measurements may be made of signals from base stations or GPS satellites, or signals from any other location reference sources. In the most efficient handset-based position location solutions, wireless assistance is provided to the handset firom a wireless network; particularly, the network sends assistance data to the user equipment (UE) aimed at increasing the signal detection reliability and/or decreasing the time required for completing the measurements. Conventional assistance data may include a variety of information, such as a list of visible signal sources, information indicating the expected code phase, the code phase window size, the signal Doppler, and the Doppler window size. One type of assistance data provides information about the signal modulation, for example the assistance data could provide the sequence of modulation bits.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[007] A system and method are described herein for classifying the user*s morphology (i.e., the characteristics of the user's location as it relates to wireless signals), and using that classification in a way to provide more efficient operation of the UE. For example, the classification may be used to assist the UE in determining its location more efficiently, without needless interruption or unnecessary use of system resources.<br>
[008] A wireless apparatus for efficiently perfomaing position location operations is described comprising a receiver including a system for measxjring a first set of signals received in the UE firom RF signal sources within range of the UE, to provide a first set of data measurements. A morphology classifier is provided for classifying the user's morphology responsive to the first set of data measurements. A control system, responsive to the morphology classification, controls the UE in one embodiment to detemiine whether to perform operations including at least one of fixing position location determinations, and sending unsolicited sensitivity assistance data to the UE, thereby conserving system resources.    The wireless apparatus may be used in a<br><br>
communication system in which the RF signal sources comprise a plurality of base stations in a CDMA network, and the receiver includes means for taking data measurements including at least two of Ec/No, RSSI, RTD, the number of pilots in the found set, and the dynamic variation of energy profiles among the found pilots. The morphology classifier may classify the user's morphology into at least one of the following classifications: indoor, outdoor, local coverage, no local coverage, proximate to a base station, stationary, moving, urban, suburban, rural, deep indoor, mid indoor, and indoor near window. Furthermore, the wireless apparatus may comprise a system for determining a level of confidence in the classification, and the control system operates responsive to the level of confidence and the morphology classification.<br>
[009] A method of classifying morphology at the location of a UE that communicates using RF signals is described that can assist the UE in operating more efficiently, such as to assist the UE in efficiently performing position location operations. The method comprises measuring a first set of signals received in the UE from RF signal sources within range of the UE, to provide a first set of data measurements- Responsive to the first set of data measurements, the user's morphology is classified, and optionally the level of confidence in that classification may be determined. The UE is controlled responsive to the morphology classification, for example to detemiine whether to perform operations including at least one of fixing position location determinations, and sending unsolicited sensitivity assistance data to the UE, thereby conserving system resources. In some embodiments, the RF signal sources may include a plurality of base stations, and the data measurements include the SNR of each of the RF signal sources, and the RSSI. The data measurements may include AFLT measurements fi"om base stations, and/or the RF signal sources may include a plurality of positioning satellites, and the data measurements include GPS measurements. In one specific example, the RF signal sources comprise a plurality of base stations in a CDMA network, and the data measurements include at least two of Ec/No, RSSI, RTD, the number of pilots in the found set, and the dynamic variation of energy profiles among the found pilots. The morphology may be classified in a variety of classifications, for example indoor, outdoor, city, rural, and so forth. The previously known location of the UE may be considered while classifying the morphology.<br><br>

[046]    Overview of GPS system and user equipment<br>
[047]       Reference is now made to Figs. 1, 2, and 3.   Fig. I illustrates a GPS<br>
environment that includes a plurality of GPS satellites (SVs) 11 that emit GPS<br>
positioning signals 12, a plurahty of land-based base stations 10, and user equipment<br>
(UE) 14 such as a cell phone.   The base stations 10 are connected to a cellular<br>
infrastructure network 15, which allows it to communicate with other networks and<br>
communication systems, such as a phone system 16, computer networks 17a, such as<br>
the internet, and other communication systems 17b.  Thus, the base stations 10 may<br>
comprise part of a communication network that may include a number of additional<br>
communication systems in communication with the base stations.<br>
[048]       The UE 14 is described elsewhere herein, for example with reference to<br>
Fig, 2, but typically includes a GPS receiver and a two-way system for communication<br><br>
with the base stations using two-way communication signals 20. It should be apparent that the GPS receiver could be implemented in a wide variety of user equipment 14 (other than cell phones) that communicate with one or more base stations 10. Furthennore, for ease of description herein, the position location system disclosed herein may be a GPS system; it should be recognized that the system described herein could be implemented in any satellite-based positioning systems. [049J In Fig. 1, the UE 14 is illustrated as a hand-held device, although it may have any suitable implementation, such as a built-in device in a vehicle such as an truck or automobile 13. The UE 14 may be carried by a user who is standing, walking, traveling in a truck or automobile, or on pubUc transportation, for example. The UE 14 may be carried in the automobile 13 as it travels on its journey. It should be apparent that the user equipment may be positioned in a wide variety of environments, and may be stationary or moving.<br>
[050] The GPS sateUites (SVs) 11 comprise any group of satellites broadcasting signals that are utilized for positioning a GPS receiver. Particularly, the sateUites are synchronized to send wireless positioning signals 12 phased to GPS time. These positioning signals are generated at a predetermined frequency, and in a predetermined format. In a cuirent GPS implementation, each SV transmits a civilian type of GPS signal on the LI-frequency band (at 1575.42 MHz) in a format that is in accordance with GPS standards. When the GPS signals are detected by a conventional GPS receiver in the UE, the GPS system 23 attempts to calculate the amount of time elapsed from transmission of the GPS signal until reception at the UE. In other words, the GPS system calculates the time required for each of the GPS signals to travel from their respective satelhtes to the GPS receiver. The pseudorange is defined as: c • (Tuse^ -Tsv)+cTbias, where c is the speed of Ught, Tuser is the GPS time when the signal from a given SV is received, Tsv is the GPS time when the sateUite transmitted the signal and Tbias is an error in the local user's clock, normally present in the GPS receiver. Sometimes pseudorange is defined with the constant "c" omitted. In the general case, the receiver needs to resolve four unknowns; X, Y, Z (the coordinates of the receiver antenna), and Twas. For this general case, resolving the four unknowns usually requires measurements from four different SVs; however, under certain circumstances, this constraint can be relaxed. For example, if an accurate altitude estimate is available, then the number of SVs required can be reduced from four to three.   In so-called<br><br>
assisted GPS operation, Tsv is not necessarily available to the receiver and instead of processing true pseudoranges, the receiver relies primarily upon code phases. In a current GPS implementation^ the code phases have one-millisecond time ambiguities, since the PN codes repeat every one milliisecond. Sometimes the data bit boundaries may be ascertained, thus producing only 20-millisecond ambiguities, [051] The base stations 10 comprise any collection of base stations utilized as part of a communication network that communicates with the UE 14 using wireless signals 20. The base stations are connected to the cellular infrastructure network 15, which provides communication services with a plurality of other communication networks such as a public phone system 16, computer networks 17a such as the internet, a position determination entity (PDE) 18 (defined above), and a variety of other communication systems shown collectively in block 17b, The PDE 18 may be connected to (or include) a GPS reference receiver (not shown) that communicates with the PDE 18 to provide useful information in determining position, such as SV position (ephemeris) information.<br>
[052] The ground-based cellular infrastructure network 15 typically provides communication services that allow the user of a cell phone to connect to another phone over the phone system 16; however the base stations 10 could also be utilized to communicate with other devices and/or for other communication purposes, such as an internet connection with a handheld personal digital assistant (PDA), In one embodiment, the base stations 10 are part of a GSM communication network; however, in other embodiments other types of synchronous (e.g., CDMA2000) or asynchronous communication networks may be used.<br>
[0531 A classification server 19 may also be provided to assist the UE in classifying its morphology, as discussed herein. The classification server 19 may comprise, for example, a server or a group of servers that are designed and programmed to receive information and process this information to classify^ the morphology of the UE, or to assist the UE in making the classification, [054] Fig. 2 is a block diagram of one embodiment of the mobile device 14, which includes communication and position location systems. A cellular communication system 22 is connected to an anterma 21 that communicates using the cellular signals 20,   The cellular communication system 22 comprises suitable devices, such as a<br><br>
modem, hardware, and software for communicating with and/or detecting signals 20 from base stations, and processing transmitted or received information. [055] A GPS position location system 23 in the UE is connected to the antenna 21 to receive positioning signals 12 transmitted from GPS satellites. The GPS system 23 comprises any suitable hardware and software for receiving and processing GPS signals and for performing calculations. In some assisted GPS implementations the final position location calculations (e.g., latitude and longitude) are performed at a remote server such as the PDE 18, based upon code phases and other information sent from the GPS receiver to the remote server. These implementations are called MS-assisted. [056] A UE control system 25 is connected to both the two-way communication system 22 and the position location system 23. The UE control system 25 includes any appropriate stmcture, such as one or more microprocessors, memory, other hardware, firmware, and software to provide appropriate control functions. It should be apparent that the processing steps described herein are implemented in any suitable manner using hardware, software, and/or firmware, subject to control by the microprocessor. [057] The control system 25 is also connected to a user interface 26, which includes any suitable components to interface with the user, such as a keypad, a microphone/speaker for voice communication services, and a display (e*g*, a backlit LCD display). The mobile device control system 25 and user interface 26, connected to the position location system 23 and two-way communication system 22, provide suitable input-output fimctions for the GPS receiver and the two-way communication system, such as controlling user input and displaying results,<br>
[058] In some embodiments, the UE includes a morphology classifier/helper 27 as shown in Fig* 2, The classifier 27 may be connected to, or may be a part of, the UE control system 25, and comprises any suitable combination of hardware and software* The morphology classifier/helper 27 performs fimctions as appropriate to determine classification of the morphology at the UE*s location, and it may work together with the classification server 19 (Fig. 1) to determine this classification.<br>
[059] Fig. 3 is a block diagram of one embodiment of the mobile device 14. As in Fig, 2, the cellular communication system 22 is connected to an antenna 21 that communicates using the cellular signals 20, and comprises suitable devices, such as a modem, hardware, and software for communicating with and/or detecting signals 20 from base stations, and processing transmitted or received information.<br><br>
[060] In Fig. 3, a separate GPS antenna 28 is used to receive GPS positioning signals 12. In some embodiments, a single antenna can be used to support multiple bands such as cellular, GPS and PCS. The GPS system 23 as shown in Fig. 3 comprises a GPS receiver 29 that includes frequency translation circuitry and an analog-to-digital converter, a GPS clock, control logic to control the desired functions of the GPS receiver, and any suitable hardware and software for receiving and processing GPS signals and for perfoiming any calculations necessary to determine position using any suitable position location algorithm. In the illustrated embodiment, the analog-to-digital converter is connected to the buffer memory in the position location system, and the buffer memory is coupled to the DFT circuitiy to provide and store the data during the DFT operation. In some assisted GPS implementations the final position location calculations (e.g., latitude and longitude) are performed at a remote server such as the position determination entity (PDE), based upon code phases and other information sent from the GPS receiver to the remote server. Some examples of GPS systems are disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos, 5,841,396, 6,002,363, and 6,421,002, by Norman F. Krasner.<br>
[061] The UE control system 25, connected to both the two-way communication system 22 and the position location system 23, as shown in Fig. 3 includes one or more microprocessors, memory, other hardware, firmware, and software to provide appropriate control fimctions for the systems to which it is connected. It should be apparent that the processing steps described herein can be implemented in any suitable manner using hardware, software, and/or firmware, subject to control by the microprocessor.<br>
[062] The user interface 26 shown in Fig, 3 includes a keypad, a microphone/speaker for voice communication services, a display (e.g., a backlit LCD display), and any other suitable interface. The mobile device control system 25 and user interface 26 provide suitable input-output functions for the GPS receiver and the two-way communication system.<br>
[063] In the embodiment of Fig. 3, the morphology classifier/helper 27 is shown within the UE control system 25, connected to the microprocessor. Generally, the classifier comprises any suitable combination of hardware and software, and performs fimctions as appropriate relating to classifying the morphology at the UE's location. The classifier 27 may work together with the classification server 19 (Fig. 1) to<br><br>
determine this classification, or it may work by itself in some or all of the functions for determining classification. Overview<br>
[064] A system is described herein for determining characteristics of the user's location as it relates to wireless signals (i.e,, the usefs morphology) to provide more efficient operation of the UE, for example to assist the user in determining its location more efficiently, without needless interruption or unnecessary use of system resources. The general approach described herein is to make observations, process and extract information from those measurements, and classify the user location (e.g., as either good or poor from the RF standpoint, such as indoor/outdoor) and then control the UE dependent upon that classification, such as to predict the strength of the not-yet-measured positioning signals based on that classification, 1065] One approach to classifying the user morphology of the UE could be based upon a hypothesis that the characteristics of the observable signals and their numbers can be correlated between different groups of location reference signals. For example, if all base station signals are weak, then the UE is probably indoors, and therefore the satellite signals will likely be weak,<br>
[066] In one embodiment, a method and ^paratus is described herein in which the wireless assistance data that is sent to "position location capable" user equipment ("UE") is determined responsive to one or more characteristics of signals received by the UE. Generally, the method in this embodiment involves taking some aspect of the observed signal (e.g., the signal strength, or the number of found signals, or signal-to-noise ratio, or round trip delay, or energy profile, or propagation delay profile, or the size of the search set), and using this information to provide usefiil information to the UE, such as whether to attempt to detemiine position location, or to postpone it to another time. In addition to the infonnation types listed above, the expected signal strength could also be provided to the user equipment This information could be provided exphcitly, or the base station could use it to formulate other assistance data. Description<br>
[067] Reference is now made to Figs. 4 and 5 which are flow charts that illustrate a method of classifying user morphology, and using the resulting classification to control the UE to operate more efficiently, thereby conserving system resources.    More<br><br>
particularly. Fig. 4 is a flow chart that illustrates the steps in general tenns, and Fig. 5 is<br>
a more detailed flow chart of Fig. 4 (omitting step 43 for convenience).<br>
[068]    Define a set of signals to search, to define a first set of signals<br>
[069]       At 41, a set of signals is defined as appropriate.   This step may include<br>
defining a group of AFLT signals, or GPS signals, or some combination thereof, for<br>
example.<br>
[070]       The set of signals is defined in any suitable manner, such as by a search, or<br>
by knowledge  from prior  searches,  or  some  combination thereof     In  some<br>
embodiments, a certain number of signals may be initially searched in order to find the<br>
signals that are strongest, and then the strongest signals are chosen for a more thorough<br>
search.<br>
[071]    Measure signal qualities<br>
[072]       At 42, the first set of signals is measured. This step includes observing and<br>
processing the observed data as appropriate, thereby providing a first set of data<br>
measurements.   Advantageously, the data measurements may include those normally<br>
taken during control communications between a base station and the UE, and in such<br>
an embodiment, no additional measurement features need be implemented in the UE,<br>
which is advantageous from an implementation-cost standpoint   However, in some<br>
embodiments, it may be usefiil to implement measurements in addition to those already<br>
implemented.<br>
[073]       In a CDMA system, for example, some of the usefiil data measurements may<br>
include:<br>
1)	Number of reported forward link pilot signals;<br>
2)	Pilot Ec/No for one or more of the pilot signals;<br>
3)	Total received power in CDMA frequency, or RSSI;<br>
4)	Search time and pilot RMS;<br>
5)	Active Set size;<br>
6)	Velocity estimate based on forward link pilot Doppler or dynamic variation of energy profile;<br>
7)	Velocity estimate based on observed reverse Unk Doppler or dynamic variation of energy profile;<br>
8)	Power control bit statistics;<br>
9)	Reverse link SNR;<br><br>
10)	RTD measurements; and<br>
11)	Energy profiles,<br>
1074] In some scenarios it may not be necessary to make fall measurements (i.e., it may not be necessary to take all the measurements normally made)* In other words, partial measurements, including only those of the desired qualities, may be made. In one example, the Ec/No and RSSI are used to determine the expected signal strengths of future measurements; which in turn may be used in deteimining the assistance data to be used for those future measurements.<br>
[075] Provide data measurements firom the UE to the classification server and/or the morphology classifier/helper<br>
[076] At 43, the data measurements are sent to the morphology classifier/helper 27 in the UE (shown in Figs* 2 and 3) and/or to the remote classification server 19 (shown in Fig, 1), This step may include a simple matter of communicating the information directly firom the UE, or some processing may be involved to process the received data in some manner to provide more usefiil infoimation and/or to delete unnecessary information. For example, it may be more efficient to perform initial processing steps in the morphology classifier/helper in the UE, and then send this processed information to the classification server,<br>
[077] The above prediction could be carried out by either the UE or the base station, or some combination of the UE and base station as useful or appropriate. If the base station is used to perform the classification, some partial measurements are communicated fi:om the UE to the base station, or the base station may use reverse link measurements, Canying out the signal strength prediction by the base station has an advantage in that the base station*s knowledge of the local signal propagation environment can be utilized. For example, the environment profile may be rural, where weak CDMA signals don't necessarily imply weak GPS signals, or the envirorment may be urban where weak CDMA signals do imply weak GPS signals with higher certainty,<br>
[078] If the signal strength prediction is carried out by the base station, then the predicted values could be conveyed back to the UE as separate parameters included in the assistance data, or the predicted value could be used when generating the other parameters included in the assistance data.<br><br>
[079]    Classify user morphology<br>
[080] At 44, responsive to the first set of measurements, the user's morphology is classified; e.g., the user's environment from an RF viewpoint, as seen by the UE, is classified, and optionally the level of confidence in the classification is determined (for example on a scale of zero to one). The classification of user location (and the optional level of confidence) may be based on any combination of the available types of data measurements and information available therefi"om, such as those listed above. Examples of different classification methods are described herein (see Table 1 below and Figs. 6A-6D, for example).<br>
[081] In addition, historical information and the previously known location may be used to classify location. For example, if the previous morphology was outdoor rural, it is likely that the current morphology is also outdoor rural; however if the previous morphology was outdoor urban moving, then it is much less certain that the morphology will remain unchanged.<br>
[082] The optional confidence level could be determined, for example, as a refinement to the individual classification decision steps. Each one, or some, of the binary thresholding decisions shown in Figs. 6A-6D may be replaced by a weighting function. The weighting function would assign weighting factors to the two possible outcomes of each decision. The weighting factors could be chosen such that they always add up to one for a given decision, in which case the weighting factors can be construed as approximate likelihood estimates. For the chosen final outcome, the confidence would be determined as the product of all weighting factors along the patii leading to that outcome. Higher confidence means higher reliability of the decision. For each decision, the weighting factor can be determined by an appropriately chosen function that has tiie decision input parameter as its argument The previously used decision threshold could be used as a second argument to the weighting function, but it could also be omitted, in which case the weighting factors could be determined based on, for example, solely on the input parameter and a look-up table. (Naturally, if the input parameter was close to the previously used decision threshold, then the look-up table would be expected to output weighting factors close to 0,5, 0.5.) If for some of the decisions we chose not to implement the likelihood estimation, then for those we could still use a simple weighting function that produces zero or one according to the<br><br>
previously used threshold. This way the confidence of the final decision can still be calculated the same way as described above,<br>
(083] Many different types of classifications can be made. In one example, the morphology classifications generally include indoor, outdoor, local coverage, no local coverage, proximity to a base station, stationaiy, moving, urban, suburban, rural, deep indoor, mid indoor, and indoor near window. More specific morphology classifications, as combinations of these general categories, include indoor with local coverage, outdoor near cell, outdoor dense urban moving, higih-rise building close to window, outdoor dense urban stationary, outdoor suburban moving, outdoor suburban stationary, deep indoor no local coverage close to a cell site, rural area moving, rural area stationary, outdoor suburban area edge of coverage mobile, outdoor suburban area edge of coverage stationary, and indoor mid building no local coverage. 1084] For purposes of definition, the indoor classifications include deep indoor (where no significant outside signals can be received), indoor near window (where significant outside signals can be received) and mid indoor (where only weak outside signals may be received, sometimes intermittently), [085]    Generate assistance data/information<br>
[086] At 45, the selected classification (and optionally the level of confidence) is available, and responsive thereto, the UE is controlled in any of a number of ways to more efficiently use its system resources. For example, the classification may be used by a PDE to generate assistance data relating to position location, for example the assistance.data can be optimized before sending it to the UE. Using the optimized assistance data, the UE can utilize its system resources more efficiently in determining position. For example, in response to the assistance data, the number of base stations, and/or the number of measurements may be reduced when measurements are subsequently taken by the UE.<br>
[087] The classification can be used in a number of other ways. For example, based upon the classification, thresholds may be varied, and each signal's strength can be tested against that threshold. The classification may be used to enable or disable searches for additional signals. The classification may also be used to adjust the number of signal sources to be searched.<br>
[088] The classification can be used by the PDE to determine whether or not to send unsolicited assistance messages from the PDE to the UE.<br><br>
[089]       The classification can be used to change the search priority (e.g., look first<br>
for low elevation satellites instead of high elevation satellites).<br>
[090]       The classification can be used to adjust the search window size.<br>
[091]       Generally, the classification can be used in a number of ways to change the<br>
way in which measurements are taken. Then the second set of measurements may be<br>
more usefiil and efficient<br>
[092]       The level of confidence can be used to modify (or eliminate) any of the<br>
actions that would otherwise have been instituted as a result the classification.   For<br>
example a low level of confidence suggests that the classification may be in error, and<br>
therefore a more conservative approach may be taken. On the other hand, a high level<br>
of confidence would allow a more aggressive approach to conserving energy.<br>
[093]    Morphology Classification Examples<br>
[094]       In this example, the wireless technology is CDMA and all available<br>
measurements are AFLT (i.e., base station forward link measurements). Typically, the<br>
measured AFLT signal strength is expressed as pilot signal-to-noise ratio (SNR,<br>
Ec/No), In a CDMA system, the SNR is a function of not only the received power of<br>
the desired signal but also of the interference. Therefore, one would have to evaluate<br>
all measured signal strength values jointly in order to correctly categorize the user<br>
location.<br>
[095]       A possible improvement can be achieved if the total received power (RSSr)<br>
is used. The total received power includes signals fi-om all base stations operating on<br>
the same CDMA frequency.   When the total received power is low in an urban<br>
environment then the user's position is likely an indoor or otherwise blocked location.<br>
The total received power is already part of the IS-801 AFLT measurement report<br>
(Provide Pilot Phase Measurement message or Provide General Location Measurement<br>
message).<br>
[096]       Even further improvement can be achieved if both the individual pilot SNRs<br>
and the total received power are used jointiy in the location categorization.    If<br>
in-building coverage is provided by outdoor cells in a dense urban environment, then<br>
most likely the UE will be able to find only a few pilot signal.  On the other hand, a<br>
single strong pilot implies that the user is outdoors and close to a cell site or indoors<br>
and the coverage is provided by a repeater or micro-cell In UMTS systems, the base<br>
stations broadcast information about the transmit power of the pilots.  Based on the<br><br>
pilot transmit power level, one can determine the type of the cell, which in turn can be used in determining the type of coverage (i.e-, indoor vs, outdoor). On the other hand, many pilots with moderate to weak strength may mean that the UE is located outdoors, [097]       A summary of possible scenarios and resulting classifications is listed below in the example using Table 1,<br>
[098] Table 1: Classification example: Total pilot strength and Total received power (for all observed pilots)<br>
[099] Following is a table that shows one simple classification example. This table is used to illustrate generally how a classification may be made, and it should be apparent that other methods for classifying user morphology can be implemented. For example, another more detailed classification is described below, with reference to Figs, 6A-6D. Many alternative classification systems can be implemented, for example to provide greater detail, and/or to utilize additional measurements in the calculations and decisions.<br>
[0100] In the following table, the total pilot strength and the total received power (for all observed pilots) is used to classify the user's morphology.<br>
All Ec/No	RSSI	Possible classification<br>
Low	Low	Indoor<br>
Low	High	Outdoor<br>
High	Low	Rural or edge of coverage<br>
High	High	Outdoor, indoor repeater or microcell<br>
[0101] At the outset, it maybe noticed that the particular measurements (Ec/No and RSSI) must be categorized as either "high" or "low". For this purpose, a predetermined number may simply be used to determine a "high" or "low" conclusion. Although such a simple system could be satisfactory when the observed measurement is clearly "high" or clearly "low", in many instances the observed measurement may be in a middle range that is not easily categorized as either "high" or "low". In such a situation, an algorithm may be used to more accurately categorize the observed measurement Also, the proximity of a measurement to the middle range could be used in determining a level of confidence in the classification; for example if each of the measurements is near the middle, the level of confidence would be low.   A low level of confidence<br><br>
could be interpreted as "no classification" or a "possible classification" with a lov/ probability of accuracy.<br>
[0102] Thus, when implementing a classification system, the actual algorithm for classification may be complex, and may utilize a number of factors or observations in addition to those mentioned in this example.<br>
[0103] Note that the Ec/No of the reported pilots are not independent of each other. If one pilot has high Ec/No, then the other pilots have necessarily low Ec/No, as the strong pilot acts as an interferer to the others. One very strong pilot implies that most other surrounding pilots will be too weak even to be measured, therefore the simple existence of one strong pilot means that the number of reported pilots will be small. The opposite statement is not true: the observation of only a small number of reported pilots does not necessarily imply that any of die reported pilots is strong. As mentioned before, observation of a small niunber of reported pilots and low RSSI generally implies that the device is indoors, which can be helpful for classifying the UE's morphology.<br>
[0104]  Morphology Classification Example<br>
[0105] Reference is now made to Figs. 6A-6D, which together show a flow chart of operations in one embodiment to classify the user*s morphology. These operations use decision thresholds (Nl to N3, and Tl to T12). Decision thresholds may be predetermined based upon analytical or numerical simulation methods. Another particularly suitable method of determining the best decision threshold values is to derive them empirically fi'om a set of sample measurements taken at locations with known morphologies. Once a sufficiently large set of sample data is collected, a number of trial threshold value sets can be chosen, and the sample set can be processed according to each of the trial threshold sets. The threshold set that gives decisions with the lowest error rate (when comparing the test morphology classifier's output decisions to the known morphology at the known locations) can be chosen and used in the morphology classifier 27. Because of the large number of possible trial threshold value sets, it may be important that the trial threshold sets are partitioned. This means that thresholds in independent branches of the classifier operation flow (such as shown in Figs. 6A-6D) that do not have any impact on each other, can be independently optimized, and therefore not all combinations of them need to be hypothesized.<br><br>
[0106] In general, different geographical areas may require different threshold settings. For example, the prevalent construction materials used in a given area could impact the indoor/outdoor classification when that classification is based in part or fully on RSSI. In this case, a morphology classifier 27 may select operating threshold values fi-om a set of predetermined values, where the selection is based on the geographical area derived fi'om an initial coarse UE location estimate. [0107] The operations shown in Figs. 6A to 6D may be actually performed at any suitable place, for example in the UE or in a remote server such as a PDE. In these flow charts, for convenience the test results are either "greater than" or "less than". If it turns out that the results are equal, then the test result may be arbitrarily assigned to either "greater" or "less than".<br>
[0108] At 60, classification operations start to predict the user's morphology based upon signals received in thte UE fi:om various base stations in its vicinity. [0109] At 61, a new set of measurements is obtained. These measurements may include those typically made by the UE, and for purposes of this example, include RSSI, the number of observed pilots, Ec/No, RTD, and the energy profile of each* The dynamic variation of energy profile is also calculated, and any other necessary caculations are performed to provide the necessary measurement values. All these measurements are defined herein, for example in the Definitions section above. [0110] At 62, the measured RSSI value is compared with the first threshold Tl (the RSSI threshold). If the measured RSSI value is less than Tl, then operation moves to flow chart position B, which is shown in Fig, 6C. However if the measured RSSI value is more than Tl, then at 63, the number of pilots (which is the number of pilots found in a recent search) is compared with the predetermined tiireshold number Nl. [0111] From 63, if the number of pilots is less than the predetermined number Nl, then operation moves to flow chart position A, which is shown in Fig, 6B. However, if the number of pilots is less than the number Nl, then operation moves to 64. [0112] At 64, a test is performed to determine if (for at least one pilot) the Ec/Nc is greater than a predetermined second threshold T2 (the S/N threshold). If not, then that means that none of the signals are sufficiently strong upon which to base a classification, and operation returns to 61 to obtain a new set of measurements and repeats the operations flowing therefrom. However, if the Ec/No for at least one pilot is greater than the second threshold, then operation moves to 65.<br><br>
[0113] At 65, a test is performed using the measured round trip distance (RTD), If the maximum RTD (the maximum for all observed pilots) is greater than a predetermined third threshold T3, then at 66 a classification is made that the UE is located outdoors, probably near a base station (cell)* However, if the maximum RTD is less than the threshold T3, then at 67 a classification is made that the UE is located indoors, with local coverage (e.g., within a building that has a repeater inside). [0114] Fig: 6B is a flow chart of operations that are performed if, from 63, the number of pilots is less than the predetermined number Nl. The first operation in Fig. 6B is at 70.<br>
[0115] At 70, a test is performed to determine if Ec/No (for at least one pilot) is greater than a predetermined fourth threshold T4, If less than the predetermined threshold, then the UE is probably in a denser environihent, and operation moves to 71. [0116] At 71, the dynamic variation of energy profile is compared with a fifth predetermined threshold T5- If greater, then the large variation indicates that the UE is probably moving, and at 72, a classification is made that the UE is in a dense outdoor urban environment (e.g., with many buildings around), and is moving. [0117] Returning to 71, if the dynamic variation of energy profile is smaller than the fifth threshold T5, then operation moves to 73,<br>
[0118] At 73, a test is performed using the measured round trip distance (RTD), If the maximum RTD (the maximum for all observed pilots) is greater than a predetermined sixth threshold T6, then at 74 a classification is made that the UE is located in a high rise building, close to a window. However, if the maximum RTD is less than the sixth threshold T6, then at 75 a classification is made that the UE h located outdoors in a dense urban envirormient, and is substantially stationary, [0119] Returning to 70, if at least one Ec/No is greater than the predetermined fourth threshold T4, than a relatively strong signal has been found and the UE is probably outdoors in an open (e.g., suburban) setting. Operation then moves to 76. [0120] At 76, the dynamic variation of energy profile is compared with a seventh predetermined threshold T7. If greater, then the large variation indicates that the UE is probably moving, and at 77, a classification is made that the UE is in an outdoor, surburban environment, and is moving. However, if the dynamic variation of energy profile is smaller than the seventh threshold T7, then the UE is classified as outdoor, suburban, and substantially stationary, as shown at 78,<br><br>
[0121]     Fig, 6C is a flow chart of operations that are performed if, from 62 (Fig. 6A), the RSSI is less than the first threshold T1. The first operation in Fig. 6C is at 80. J0122]     At 80, a test is performed to determine if number of observed pilots is less than a predetermined second number N2. If less than the second number N2, then few pilots have been observed, and operation moves to 81.<br>
(0123] At 81, a test is performed using the measured round trip distance (RTD), If the maximum RTD (the maximum for all observed pilots) is greater than a predetermined eighth threshold T8, then at 82 a classification is made that the UE Is deep indoors with no local coverage, and near to a base station (cell site). However, if the maximum RTD is less than the eighth threshold T8, then operation moves to 83. [0124] At 83, the dynamic variation of energy profile is compared with a ninth predetenmned threshold T9. If greater, then the large variation indicates that the UE is„ probably moving, and at 84, a classification is made that the UE is in a rural area, and is moving, However, if the dynamic variation of energy profile is smaller than the ninth threshold T9, then at 85 a classification is made that the UE is m an rural environment, substantially stationary,<br>
[0125] Returning to 80, if the number of observed pilots is not less (i.e., gieater) than a predetermined second number N2, then a relatively larger nmnber of pilots has been observed. Operation then moves to 86.<br>
[0126] At 86, a test is perfomied to detennine if Ec/No (for at least one pilot) is greater than a predetermined tenth threshold TIO, If less than the predetermined threshold, then operation moves to 87.<br>
[0127] At 87, the dynamic variation of energy profile is compared with an eleventh predetermined threshold Til. If greater, then the large variation indicates that the UE is probably moving, and at 88, a classification is made that the UE is in an outdoor suburban environment at the edge of coverage, and is moving. Hov/ever, if the dynamic variation of energy profile is smaller than the eleventh threshold Tl 1, then at 89 the UE*s morphology is classified in an outdoor suburban area, and substantially stationary.<br>
[0128] Returning to 86, if Ec/No (for at least one pilot) is greater than a predetemimed tenth threshold TIO, then a relatively strong pilot signal has been observed. Operation then moves to 90.<br><br>
10129]     At 90, a test is performed to determine if the number of clusters observed is<br>
greater than a predetermined third number N3. If the number of clusters is greater, then<br>
at 91 a classification is made that the UE is in an indoor environment, mid-building<br>
(not near a window), and there is no local coverage.   However, if the number of<br>
clusters is less, then operation moves to Fig. 6D, as indicated by the flow chart position<br>
C,<br>
[0130]     Fig. 6D is a flow chart of operations that are performed if, from 90 (Fig. 6C),<br>
the number of clusters is less than the third number N3. Operation moves from C, and<br>
the first operation in Fig. 6D is at 92.<br>
[0131]     At 92, the dynamic variation of energy profile is compared with a twelfth<br>
predetermined threshold T12. If greater, then the large variation indicates that the UE<br>
is probably moving, and at 93, a classification is made that the UE is in an outdoor<br>
suburban environment, and is moving. However, if the dynamic variation of energy<br>
profile is smaller than the twelfth threshold T12, then at 94 the UE*s morphology is<br>
classified in an outdoor suburban area, and substantially stationary.<br>
[0132]     Note that in many cases, some  a priori knowledge  may enable  the<br>
morphology classifier to bypass some of the decision branches shown in Figs.<br>
6A to 6D.   For example, an initial coarse UE location estimate may already indicate<br>
whether the location must be urban, suburban, etc.   Another example is that stored<br>
information associated with Pilot ID's may provide extra knowledge useful in the<br>
morphology classification.   If the UE measures, for example, high SNR of a Pilot<br>
transmitted by a Base Station known to provide indoor coverage, then this is a strong<br>
indication that the UE is indoors, regardless of other factors such as RSSL   Any such<br>
external information can be used to improve the rehability of the morphology<br>
classifier's decisions.<br>
[0133]  Using the Morphology Classification<br>
[0134]     Once the morphology classification has been determined with a sufficient<br>
level of reliability, it can be used to generate the assistance data in a number of<br>
different ways. A few examples are listed below:<br>
[0135]      1) The requesting entity may enable/disable further AFLT or GPS searches.<br>
For example, if the user location is found to be substantially blocked to GPS signals,<br>
then further searches may be disabled for a time in order to avoid wasting hardware<br>
resources on extensive signal searches.<br><br>
[0136] 2) The morphology classification may be used to govern whether or not to send unsolicited sensitivity assistance messages. If the user location is detennined to be indoors but not completely blocked, then the base station can effectively send sensitivity assistance data to the UE to enhance the efficiency of the location reference signal search. However, if the user's location is detennined to be outdoors, then sending the sensitivity assistance data is unnecessary and can be avoided, thereby conserving system resources.<br>
[01371 3) The number of signal sources to be searched can be adjusted based on the morphology classification.<br>
[0138] 4) The search window size can be adjusted based on the morphology classification,<br>
[0139]     The particular level of confidence in the classification may be used to adjust any of the above operations; for example, a low level of confidence might suggest an increase in the search window size and the number of signal sources to be searched. [0140]  Simulation Results<br>
[0141] Reference is now made to Fig. 7. As an example, simulations were carried out to demonstrate the utility of one example, the results of which are shown in Fig. 7. Particularly, Fig. 7 plots the probability of detection as a fimction of the search window size (in GPS C/A chips) for two different expected signal levels. For this purpose two cases were hypothesized: in the first case, the signal strength received from the GPS satellites was assumed to be -130dBm (corresponding to a clear view of the satellite). In the second case, the signal strength received from the GPS satellites was assumed to be -137 dBm (conesponding to a blocked view of the satellite).. In both cases, the UE was directed to search for eight satellites, and the total search time was about three seconds.<br>
[0142] In the simulations, sub-cases were considered conesponding to search window sizes varying from 1 C/A chip to 30 C/A chips. For each search window size case, 30,000 measurements were simulated and the detection probability was determined. The detection probability was determined as the relative frequency of the event that both the following conditions were satisfied: 1) the tme signal code phase falls within the search window, and 2) the integrated signal plus noise in the true search bin exceeds a detection threshold.<br><br>
[0143] In this simulation, the position of the true signal was assumed to have a Gaussian distribution with a standard deviation of about 10 C/A chips. The detection threshold was determined based on a target 0.0001 effective false alarm rate. The effective false alarm rate is the probability of the integrated noise in any of the search bins within the search window exceeding the detection threshold, therefore making the UE declare finding the GPS signal, even though the GPS signal was not present. The false alarm rate per search bin was calculated fix)m the effective false alarm rate as:<br><br>
where Effective_False_Alarra_Rate =10-4 and WIN is the number of search bins, which here is equal to twice the search window size. The factor of two is the result of the fact that two samples are taken per C/A chip. [0144]     Then the threshold can be calculated as:<br><br>
[0145]     In the above, the measurement noise is approximated as white Gaussian. [0146]     The SMR (in dB) of the integrated signal was determined as:<br>
SNR = (GPS _ signal_ strength - Thermal_ noise - Receiver_ noise _ figure)<br>
10' log^^Qntegration JTime)<br>
where GPS_signal strength is either -130dBm or -137dBm. [0147]     The Thermal_noise is -174dBm/Hz, which can be obtained as:<br><br>
[0148]     Receiver_noise_figure -5dB; and [0149]     Integration_time is calculated as:<br><br>
where Total_search_time is 3s; Num^SV is 8; and WIN is the number of bins to be<br>
searched, as described earlier,<br>
[0150] With all the assumptions above, the sunulation results are shown in the graph of Fig. 7. The plot corresponding to a GPS signal level of-130dBm is shown at 101, and the plot corresponding to a GPS signal level of-IBVdBm is shown at 102. As can be observed from the plots in this example, the detection probability is maximized when the search window size is set to 10 C/A chips if the signal strength is expected to be -137dBm, while it is maximized if the search window size is set to close to 30 C/A<br><br>
chips when the signal strength is expected to be -130dBm. Therefore, it is shown that<br>
performance can be improved if the search window size is made a function of the<br>
expected signal strength.<br>
[0151]     Note that further improvement could be achieved if the number of satellites<br>
to be searched is also made a function of the expected signal strength.<br>
[0152]     It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, in view of these teachings,<br>
that alternative embodiments may be implemented without deviating from the spirit or<br>
scope of the invention.  This invention is to be limited only by the following claims,<br>
