Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates generally to communications and, in<br>
particular, to cross paging in multi-network communication systems.<br><br>
WO 2007/027547	PCT/US2006/033382<br>
2<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Third Generation Partnership Project 2 (3GPP2) Code Division Multiple<br>
Access (CDMA), known as 3GPP2 cdma2000, networks support concurrent<br>
services functionality for packet data and circuit switched voice<br>
communication. The original system supports packet data and circuit<br>
switched voice communication and is commonly referred to as the cdma2000<br>
1X system or the 3G1X system. The cdma2000 1X system air interface is<br>
standardized in 3GPP2 document C.S0001 through C.S0005 and<br>
corresponding Telecommunication Industry Associates (TIA) standard TIA-<br>
2000. In addition, new packet data standards, such as cdma2000 High Rate<br>
Packet Data (cdma2000 HRPD) have been created. The cdma2000 HRPD<br>
air interface is standardized in 3GPP2 documents C.S0024-A and C.S0063.<br>
To provide communication continuity for a wireless unit moving<br>
between overlaid 1x and packet data networks, it is desirable to provide<br>
cross-paging capabilities that enable the wireless unit to be notified of<br>
incoming-1x circuit voice calls when the unit is operating"on the HRPD-<br>
network and that notify the unit of incoming packet data in the HRPD packet<br>
data network when the unit is operating on the 1X network. U.S. patent<br>
application publication no. 2004/0120283 can be referenced for a description<br>
of certain aspects of cross-paging functionality. A 3GPP2 architecture which<br>
supports cross paging typically includes a Mobile Switching Center (MSC), a<br>
1x BS (Base Station), an HRPD AN (Access Network or Access Node), an<br>
HRPD PCF (Packet Control Function), and a Packet Data Serving Node<br>
(PDSN) and is standardized for two different RAN architectures in 3GPP2,<br>
A.S0008-A and A.S0009.<br>
Hybrid Access Terminals (HATs) are capable of supporting both the<br>
3G1x and HRPD air interface technologies. In a joint circuit switched, packet<br>
switched communication network, such as the 3GPP2 3G1x-HRPD network<br>
(in which the 3G1x network provides circuit switched voice support and the<br>
HRPD network provides packet switched service), cross paging is used to<br><br>
WO 2007/027547	PCT/US2006/033382<br>
3<br>
page a HAT on the network where it is currently monitoring a forward link<br>
channel. Thus, cross paging is used to inform the HAT of a call on another<br>
network where the HAT is registered for service but not currently monitoring a<br>
forward link channel.<br>
When a HAT is paged for service on a second network via a first<br>
network, it releases any active call on the first network and begins monitoring<br>
a forward link on the second network, from which it is being paged, to<br>
complete the call. For example, a HAT may be paged for circuit voice service<br>
from the 3G1x network while the HAT is in the HRPD network, currently<br>
engaged in an active packet data call. Alternatively, the HAT may be paged<br>
for packet data service from the HRPD network while in the 3G1x network<br>
monitoring a forward link channel.<br>
When a HAT is cross paged for service in another network, a condition<br>
known as 'ghost ring' may occur. A 'ghost ring' occurs when the HAT<br>
responds to a page from a second network while in the first network,<br>
terminates any active call in the first network, and attempts to initiate the new<br>
call for which it was paged but fails because network resources required to<br>
support the call (e.g., air traffic channels or network bearer connections) are<br>
not available in the second network (even though they may have been<br>
available when the HAT was originally paged, as may occur in networks<br>
operating at or near full capacity). When such a scenario occurs, not only<br>
does the HAT fail to successfully initiate the call in the second network, but it<br>
also may have dropped an existing call in the first network to receive the new<br>
call. Generally, then, this is a problem in cross paging architectures where<br>
each RAN independently manages its network resources.<br>
FIG. 1 is a signaling flow diagram 10 depicting, in accordance with the<br>
prior art (see the 3GPP2-A.S0008-A standard, May 2005 V&amp;V version), a<br>
HAT being paged for HRPD packet data service via a 1x network air interface<br>
while the HAT is engaged in a circuit voice call. The HAT is registered in the<br>
1x system and on a traffic channel when packet data for the HAT arrives at<br>
the HRPD AN/PCF supporting the HAT's packet data session in the packet<br><br>
WO 2007/027547	PCT/US2006/033382<br>
4<br>
data network. The arrival of data at the HRPD access network triggers an<br>
HRPD cross page in the 1x network.<br>
In prior art signaling 11, it is assumed that, when the HAT arrives on<br>
the HRPD network after releasing its circuit call, a connection will successfully<br>
be established between the HAT and the HRPD network. However, if for any<br>
reason the connection fails to be established due to a lack of network<br>
resources, not only will the new call fail to be delivered in the HRPD network,<br>
but the 1x circuit call will also have been unnecessarily dropped.<br>
Operators are beginning to deploy Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP)<br>
and Video Telephony (VT) on their HRPD packet data networks and will rely<br>
on cross paging to page HATs for packet data service in the 3G1X circuit<br>
network. Therefore, a need exists to increase the cross-paging call success<br>
rate in joint networks such as the 3GPP2 3G1X-HRPD communication<br>
networks.<br>

Specific embodiments of the present invention are disclosed below<br>
with reference to FIGs. 2-12. Both the description and the illustrations have<br>
been drafted with the intent to enhance understanding. For example, the<br>
dimensions of some of the figure elements may be exaggerated relative to<br>
other elements, and well-known elements that are beneficial or even<br>
necessary to a commercially successful implementation may not be depicted<br>
so that a less obstructed and a more clear presentation of embodiments may<br>
be achieved. In addition, although the signaling flow diagrams above are<br>
described and shown with reference to specific signaling in a specific order,<br>
some of this signaling may be omitted or some may be combined, sub-<br>
divided, or reordered without departing from the scope of the claims. Thus,<br>
unless specifically indicated, the order and grouping of signaling is not a<br>
limitation of other embodiments that may lie within the scope of the claims<br>
Simplicity and clarity in both illustration and description are sought to<br>
effectively enable a person of skill in the art to make, use, and best practice<br>
the present invention in view of what is already known in the art. One of skill<br>
in the art will appreciate that various modifications andchanges may be made<br>
to the specific embodiments described below without departing from the spirit<br>
and scope of the present invention. Thus, the specification and drawings are<br>
to be regarded as illustrative and exemplary rather than restrictive or all-<br>
encompassing, and all such modifications to the specific embodiments<br>
described below are intended to be included within the scope of the present<br>
invention.<br>
Detailed Description of Embodiments<br>
Various embodiments are described which can serve to increase the<br>
cross paging call success rate in joint networks such as the 3GPP2 3G1X-<br>
HRPD communication networks. Resource reservation by a requesting<br>
network in the context of cross paging is described. In general, such resource<br><br>
WO 2007/027547	PCT/US2006/033382<br>
7<br>
reservation may be triggered by the occurrence of any one of a variety of<br>
events in conjunction with the requesting network determining that a<br>
communication session with an AT is desirable. Examples of triggering events<br>
include the following: the AT subscribing for resource reservation as a matter<br>
of configuration, the AT having a particular call state and perhaps with regard<br>
to particular services, the AT requesting resource reservation (before or after<br>
being paged / notified of the requesting network's desire to provide service,<br>
the communication session for which the requesting network is requesting the<br>
AT is of a particular type, and/or resource reservation is an operational default<br>
system operation.<br>
The disclosed embodiments can be more fully understood with<br>
reference to FIGs. 2-12. FIG. 2 is a block diagram depiction of a wireless<br>
communication system 100 in accordance with multiple embodiments of the<br>
present invention. At present, standards bodies such as OMA (Open Mobile<br>
Alliance), 3GPP (3rd Generation Partnership Project), 3GPP2 (3rd<br>
Generation Partnership Project 2) and IEEE (Institute of Electrical and<br>
Electronics Engineers) 802 are developing standards specifications for<br>
wireless telecommunications systems. (These groups may be contacted via<br>
http://www.openmobilealliance.com,	http://www.3qpp.org/,<br>
http://www.3qpp2.com/ and http://www.ieee802.org/, respectively.)<br>
Communication system 100 represents a system having an architecture in<br>
accordance with multiple 3GPP2 technologies cdma2000 1X (also known as<br>
3G1X) and HRPD (also known as 1xEV-DO or IS-856)), suitably modified to<br>
implement the present invention. For example, nodes 121 and 122 have<br>
architectures in accordance with 1X and HRPD, respectively, which are<br>
suitably modified to implement the present invention.<br>
Alternative embodiments of the present invention may be implemented<br>
in communication systems that employ other or additional technologies such<br>
as, but not limited to, others described in the 3GPP2 specifications, those<br>
described in the 3GPP specifications (e.g., GSM, GPRS, EDGE, W-CDMA,<br>
UTRAN, FOMA, UMTS, HSDPA, and HSUPA), those described in the IEEE's<br>
802.xx specifications, those described in the OMA standards specifications,<br><br>
WO 2007/027547	PCT/US2006/033382<br>
8<br>
those described in the IS-136 (TDMA Third Generation Wireless Standards)<br>
specification, those described in the lS-95 (CDMA) specification, 1xEV-DV<br>
technologies, and integrated dispatch enhanced network technologies.<br>
More specifically, communication system 100 comprises HAT 101,<br>
nodes 121 and 122, Access Network Authentication, Authorization and<br>
Accounting (AN-AAA) entity 142, Mobile Switching Center (MSC) 151, Packet<br>
Data Serving Node (PDSN) 161, TIA-41 network 171, public switched<br>
telephone network (PSTN) 173, and IP-network 175. Those skilled in the art<br>
will recognize that FIG. 2 does not depict all of the network equipment<br>
necessary for system 100 to operate but only those system components and<br>
logical entities particularly relevant to the description of embodiments herein.<br>
For example, 1X circuit node 121 is known to comprise devices such as base<br>
transceiver stations (BTSs) and base site controllers (BSCs), and packet data<br>
node 122 is known to comprise devices such as access networks (ANs) and<br>
packet control functions (PCFs).<br>
FIG. 3 is a block diagram depiction of a wireless communication<br>
system 300 in accordance with multiple embodiments of the present<br>
invention. Communication system 300 is depicted in a more generalized<br>
manner than communication system 100. In particular, access terminal (AT)<br>
301 and two networks are shown, serving network 311 and target network<br>
312. Those skilled in the art will recognize that FIG. 3 does not depict all of<br>
the physical fixed network components necessary for system 300 to operate<br>
but only those system components and logical entities particularly relevant to<br>
the description of embodiments herein.<br>
For example, FIG. 3 depicts networks 311-312 as respectively<br>
comprising transceivers 325-326, network interfaces 321-322, and processing<br>
units 323-324. In general, components such as processing units, network<br>
interfaces and transceivers are well-known. For example, network processing<br>
units are known to comprise basic components such as, but neither limited to<br>
nor necessarily requiring, microprocessors, microcontrollers, memory devices,<br>
application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), and/or logic circuitry. Such<br>
components are typically adapted to implement algorithms and/or protocols<br><br>
WO 2007/027547	PCT/US2006/033382<br>
9<br>
that have been expressed using high-level design languages or descriptions,<br>
expressed using computer instructions, expressed using signaling flow<br>
diagrams, and/or expressed using logic flow diagrams.<br>
Thus, given an algorithm, a logic flow, a messaging / signaling flow,<br>
and/or a protocol specification, those skilled in the art are aware of the many<br>
design and development techniques available to implement a network<br>
processing unit that performs the given logic. Therefore, networks 311-312<br>
represent known networks that have been adapted, in accordance with the<br>
description herein, to implement multiple embodiments of the present<br>
invention. Furthermore, those skilled in the art will recognize that aspects of<br>
the present invention may be implemented in and across various physical<br>
components and none are necessarily limited to single platform<br>
implementations. For example, the network aspects of the present invention<br>
may be implemented in / across one or more of the following components: a<br>
BTS, a BSC, an AN, and / or an MSC.<br>
Thus, in certain embodiments, such as those in which system 100<br>
components are mapped onto the generalized system 300 depiction, the<br>
network representing the 1X system (either network 311 or network 312,<br>
depending on which is the serving network) may comprise MSC 151 (or a<br>
portion thereof) and circuit node 121 (or a portion thereof). In such an<br>
embodiment, then, networking interface 321 (or 322) and processing unit 323<br>
(or 324) may be respectively distributed across corresponding aspects of<br>
MSC 151 and circuit node 121. A more general example, then, would be<br>
transceivers 325-326, network interfaces 321-322, and / or processing units<br>
323-324 being distributed across corresponding aspects of one or more of the<br>
following components: a BTS, a BSC, an AN, and / or an MSC.<br>
Networks 311 and 312 respectively use air interfaces comprising<br>
channel groups 111 and 112 for communication with AT 301. In 3GPP2<br>
embodiments, channel groups 111 and 112 each comprise traffic channels,<br>
which are dynamically assigned and de-assigned to support user services,<br>
and a variety of well-known non-traffic channel types, such as broadcast<br>
channels, paging channels, access channels and common control channels,<br><br>
WO 2007/027547	PCT/US2006/033382<br>
10<br>
all in accordance with the particular 3GPP2 signaling technology used. For<br>
example, channel groups 111 and 112 may respectively comprise a 1X<br>
channel group and an HRPD channel group, or vice versa.<br>
Access terminals (ATs), or remote units, may serve as mobile stations<br>
(MSs); however, ATs are not necessarily mobile nor able to move. Also,<br>
remote units / ATs may be wireless devices but they do not necessarily need<br>
to be wireless; a remote unit / AT may be either wired or wireless. Moreover,<br>
remote unit / AT platforms are known to refer to a wide variety of consumer<br>
electronic platforms such as, but not limited to, mobile stations (MSs), user<br>
equipment (UE), terminal equipment, gaming devices, personal computers,<br>
personal digital assistants (PDAs), cable set-top boxes and satellite set-top<br>
boxes. In particular, AT 301 comprises processing unit 302, transceiver 303,<br>
a keypad (not shown), a speaker (not shown), a microphone (not shown), and<br>
a display (not shown). Processing units, transceivers, keypads, speakers,<br>
microphones, and displays as used in ATs are all well-known in the art.<br>
For example, AT processing units are known to comprise basic<br>
components such as, but neither limited to nor necessarily requiring,<br>
microprocessors, digital-signal processors (DSPs), microcontrollers, memory<br>
devices, application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), and/or logic circuitry.<br>
Such AT components are typically adapted to implement algorithms and/or<br>
protocols that have been expressed using high-level design languages or<br>
descriptions, expressed using computer instructions, expressed using<br>
messaging / signaling flow diagrams, and/or expressed using logic flow<br>
diagrams. Thus, given an algorithm, a logic flow, a messaging / signaling flow,<br>
a call flow, and/or a protocol specification, those skilled in the art are aware of<br>
the many design and development techniques available to implement user<br>
equipment that performs the given logic. Therefore, AT 301 represents a<br>
known AT that has been adapted, in accordance with the description herein,<br>
to implement embodiments of the present invention.<br>
Operation of various embodiments in accordance with the present<br>
invention occur substantially as follows. Relevant operation of some of the<br>
embodiments illustrated by FIG. 3 begins with AT 301 being registered with<br><br>
WO 2007/027547	PCT/US2006/033382<br>
11<br>
both networks 311 and 312 but being served by serving network 311. Thus,<br>
AT processing unit 302 is obtaining communication service from serving<br>
network 311 via AT transceiver 303 and network processing unit 323 is<br>
providing communication service to AT 301 via network transceiver 325. This<br>
communication service being provided to AT 301 by serving network 311 may<br>
take various forms depending on AT 301's service state. For example, AT<br>
301 may be involved in a service via a traffic channel of air interface 111<br>
(e.g., a busy service state) or merely monitoring a paging or broadcast<br>
channel of air interface 111 (e.g., an idle service state). Thus, communication<br>
service of various forms is provided AT 301 by serving network 311 via air<br>
interface 111. Having a desire to provide service to AT 301, target network<br>
312 requests AT 301 for service via network interface 322 and serving<br>
network 311. Target network 312 may determine that a communication<br>
session (or service connection) with the AT is desirable in response to<br>
receiving signaling for a service involving the AT such as a circuit-switched<br>
service or a packet data service.<br>
For example, in the case in which serving network 311 is a 1X network<br>
and target network 312 an HRPD network, a packet data service such as a<br>
packet data call request for AT 301 could be received by target network 312<br>
(e.g., data arriving for delivery to AT 301). In another example in which<br>
serving network 311 is an HRPD network and target network 312 a 1X<br>
network, a circuit-switched service such as a circuit-switched call request for<br>
AT 301 could be received by target network 312, thereby creating the need<br>
for a communication session with AT 301.<br>
Thus, serving network processing unit 323 receives a message from<br>
target network 312 via network interface 321 requesting to provide<br>
communication service to AT 301. Depending on the embodiment and/or the<br>
particular scenario at hand, the message requesting to provide service may<br>
take the form of a service request or a paging request message. Signaling<br>
408 (FIG. 4) and signaling 504 (FIG. 5), both A1-BS Service Request<br>
messages, are examples of service request messages, while signaling 603<br><br>
WO 2007/027547	PCT/US2006/033382<br>
12<br>
(FIG. 6) and signaling 1006 (FIG. 10) are examples of paging request<br>
messages.<br>
In some embodiments in response to receiving the message<br>
requesting to provide communication service to AT 301, serving network 311<br>
pages (i.e., generally notifies in some manner) AT 301. AT processing unit<br>
302 receives the page (i.e., notification) via transceiver 303, and depending<br>
on the embodiment may respond by indicating that resource reservation is<br>
requested. AT processing unit 302, via transceiver 303, may send an<br>
indication that resource reservation is requested, for the communication<br>
service that is to be provided by target network 312, before AT 301 leaves the<br>
communication service of serving network 311. In other words, AT 301 may<br>
be trying to ensure that target network 312 will have the resources required to<br>
provide the service for which AT 301 is being requested, before AT 301 drops<br>
a communication service (such as an ongoing call) being provided by serving<br>
network 311.<br>
Depending on the embodiment, in response to receiving the message<br>
from target network 312 requesting to provide communication service to AT<br>
301, serving network 311 sends an indication to target network"312" that<br>
resource reservation is requested. This indication may be sent in response to<br>
receiving a resource reservation request from AT 301 (e.g., after paging /<br>
notifying AT 301) or as a result of a determination by serving network 311 that<br>
resource reservation is desirable (perhaps before paging / notifying AT 301).<br>
For example, AT 301 may have previously subscribed to resource reservation<br>
via serving network 311 or AT 301 may be actively involved in a<br>
communication service via serving network 311 (such as a call). Thus,<br>
processing unit 323 may determine to send an indication to target network<br>
312 that resource reservation is requested either before or after paging /<br>
notifying AT 301. Signaling 505 (FIG. 5), an A1-BS Service Response<br>
message, and signaling 605 (FIG. 6), a Paging Response message (which<br>
could alternatively be a Clear Request message), are examples of indications<br>
that resource reservation is requested. FIG. 12 is a block diagram (1200)<br>
depicting an illustrative message definition for a paging response message, a<br><br>
WO 2007/027547	PCT/US2006/033382<br>
13<br>
Paging Response message in particular, that includes an element ("RR<br>
REQUEST") for indicating whether resource reservation is requested.<br>
In response to receiving via network interface 322 an indication that<br>
resource reservation is requested, target network processing unit 324<br>
reserves at least one communication resource in anticipation of providing<br>
service to AT 301. Depending on the embodiment and the particular<br>
communication service that target network 312 seeks to provide to AT 301,<br>
communication resources such as an air interface traffic channel and/or a<br>
network bearer resource, such as an A8 connection, an A10 connection,<br>
terrestrial circuits, or SCCP resources, may be reserved.<br>
After reserving resources (and depending on the embodiment this may<br>
occur in response to various events), target network processing unit 324, via<br>
network interface 322, may indicate to serving network 311 that resource<br>
reservation has occurred in anticipation of providing service to AT 301.<br>
Signaling 408 (FIG. 4) and signaling 509 (FIG. 5), both A1-BS Service<br>
Request messages, and signaling 1006 (FIG. 10) and signaling 608 (FIG. 6),<br>
both Paging Request messages, are examples of indications that resource<br>
reservation has occurred. In addition, FIG. "8 is "a block" "diagram (800)<br>
depicting an illustrative message definition for a service request message, a<br>
BS Service Request message in particular, that includes an element ("RR<br>
INDICATION") for indicating whether anticipatory resource reservation has<br>
occurred. Similarly, FIG. 11 is a block diagram (1100) depicting an illustrative<br>
message definition for a paging request message, a Paging Request<br>
message in particular, that includes an element ("RR INDICATION") for<br>
indicating whether anticipatory resource reservation has occurred.<br>
Serving network processing unit 323, via network interface 321,<br>
receives the indication that resource reservation has occurred in anticipation<br>
of providing service to AT 301. Depending on the embodiment, processing<br>
unit 323 may proceed with paging / notifying AT 301, via transceiver 325, for<br>
the communication service to be provided by target network 312, in response<br>
to receiving the indication that resources have been reserved. However,<br><br>
WO 2007/027547	PCT/US2006/033382<br>
14<br>
paging / notifying AT 301 need not be in response to an indication of resource<br>
reservation, although from an AT user's perspective this may be desirable.<br>
In general, resource reservation by a target network may be triggered<br>
by the occurrence of any one of a variety of events in conjunction with the<br>
target network determining that a communication session with an AT is<br>
desirable. Examples of triggering events include the following: the AT<br>
subscribing for resource reservation as a matter of configuration, the AT<br>
having a particular call state (such as busy, e.g.) and perhaps with regard to<br>
particular services (such as a voice or data call, e.g.), the AT requesting<br>
resource reservation (before or after being paged / notified of the target<br>
network's request to provide service, the communication session for which the<br>
target network is requesting the AT is of a particular type (e.g., a packet data<br>
service type, examples of which might include a voice over internet protocol<br>
(VoIP) call and / or a video telephony (VT) call), and/or resource reservation is<br>
default system operation. Various specific embodiments which involve<br>
conveying information about these triggering events and/or further defining<br>
these triggering events for particular networks and technologies have been<br>
provided above and will be added to in the discussion that follows.<br>
The timing of and manner in which information about particular<br>
triggering events is communicated (or indicated) in a system is highly specific<br>
to each embodiment, and many possibilities exist. For example, some<br>
embodiments employ the use of a message such as an event notification<br>
message. FIG. 7 is a block diagram depicting an illustrative message<br>
definition for an event notification message in accordance with multiple<br>
embodiments of the present invention. Messaging blocks 710 and 720 depict<br>
the "EVENT" element and some detail of its makeup. Messaging block 730<br>
provides an illustrative list of "EVENT IDENTIFIERS" that may be used;<br>
however, this list is merely an example. A subset of the list may be used,<br>
additional event indicators may be added, an altogether different list of event<br>
indicators may be used, or event indicators may be incorporated into<br>
messaging other than the dedicated messaging that the event notification<br>
message represents. For example, certain event indicators may be added to<br><br>
WO 2007/027547	PCT/US2006/033382<br>
15<br>
certain other signaling to indicate event information as that signaling is used.<br>
Signaling 401 (FIG. 4) and signaling 1002 (FIG. 10) are examples of event<br>
notification messaging being used.<br>
Some examples of event indicators, whether incorporated into an<br>
event notification message or not, include the following: cross-paging-related<br>
configuration information for the AT, call state information for the AT, location<br>
information for the AT, and resource reservation subscription information for<br>
the AT. The cross-paging-related configuration information for the AT may<br>
include the resource reservation subscription information or somehow, and<br>
perhaps additionally, indicate how resource reservation is to be handled for<br>
the AT. The cross-paging-reiated configuration information may be sent by<br>
the AT to the serving network upon arrival of the AT in the serving network,<br>
and if not sent sooner, may be sent to the target network in response to the<br>
target network's request of the serving network to page the AT.<br>
The call state information for the AT may include information indicating<br>
call states such as a busy call state, an idle call state, an active packet data<br>
session state, and / or a dormant packet data session state. Other call states<br>
could be added, of course, and information indicating the present call state of<br>
the AT in the serving network may be sent to the target network in response<br>
to the present call state of the AT changing. In other words, the serving<br>
network may keep the target network apprised of call state changes for the<br>
AT in order to enable the target network to make resource reservation<br>
decisions.<br>
Information indicating the location of the AT in the serving network may<br>
also be sent to the target network. For example, an indication of which cell is<br>
serving the AT may be sent. The target network may then use the AT location<br>
information in order to more efficiently reserve resources. For example, fewer<br>
air interface and / or network bearer resources may need to be reserved by<br>
the target network if sufficient location information can be provided for the AT.<br>
In addition to or instead of an event notification message, location<br>
information for the AT may be sent in a service response message. FIG. 9 is<br>
a block diagram (900) depicting an illustrative message definition for a service<br><br>

response message in accordance with multiple embodiments of the present<br>
invention. Block diagram 900 depicts the "LOCATION INFORMATION"<br>
element of an illustrative BS Service Response message along with some of<br>
its other elements. Signaling 505 (FIG. 5) is an example of such a BS Service<br>
Response message being used.<br>

network interface,<br>
adapted to request, via the network interface and a second network, an access<br>
terminal (AT) for service,<br>
adapted to establish a connection with the AT via the transceiver to support a<br>
communication session, and<br>
adapted in at least one manner of adaptation from the group of adaptations<br>
consisting of:<br>
adapted to reserve, prior to requesting the AT for service via the second network<br>
and prior to establishing the connection with the AT, at least one<br>
communication resource in anticipation of providing service to the AT,<br>
adapted to receive, from the second network via the network interface prior to<br>
establishing the connection with the AT, information indicating a present<br>
call state of the AT in the second network,<br>
adapted to receive, from the second network via the network interface prior to<br>
establishing the connection with the AT, cross-paging-related<br>
configuration information for the AT, and<br>
adapted to receive, from the second network via the network interface prior to<br>
establishing the connection with the AT, an indication that resource<br>
reservation is requested.<br>
9. A network comprising:<br>
AMENDED PAGE<br><br>
-28-<br>
a transceiver;<br>
a network interface;<br>
a processing unit, communicatively coupled to the transceiver and the<br>
network interface,<br>
adapted to provide communication service to an access terminal (AT) via the<br>
transceiver,<br>
adapted to receive a message from a second network via the network interface<br>
requesting to provide communication service to the AT, and<br>
adapted in at least one manner of adaptation from the group of adaptations<br>
consisting of:<br>
adapted to send information via the network interface indicating a present call<br>
state of the AT,<br>
adapted to send cross-paging-related configuration information for the AT via the<br>
network interface, and<br>
adapted to send an indication via the network interface that resource reservation<br>
is requested.<br>
10. An access terminal (AT) comprising:<br>
a transceiver;<br>
a processing unit, communicatively coupled to the transceiver,<br>
adapted to obtain communication service from a first network via the transceiver,<br>
and<br>
adapted to send, via the transceiver before leaving the communication service of<br>
the first network, an indication that resource reservation is requested.<br><br>
Various embodiments are described which can serve to increase the cross pagin; call success rate in joint networks.<br>
Resource reservation by a requesting network (312) in the context of cross paging is described. In general, such resource reservation<br>
may be triggered by the occurrence of any one of a variety of events in conjunction with the requesting network determining tha. a<br>
communication session with an AT (301) is desirable. Examples of triggering events include the following: the AT subscribing for<br>
resource reservation as a matter of configuration, the AT having a particular call state and perhaps with regard to particular services,<br>
the AT requesting resource reservation (before or after being paged / notified of the requesting network's desire to provide service,<br>
the communication session for which the requesting network is requesting the AT is of a particular type, and/or resource reservation<br>
is an operational default system operation.</td>
