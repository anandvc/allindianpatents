				<td>ABSORBENT ARTICLE AND METHOD FOR MANUFACTURING<br>
ABSORBENT ELEMENT Technical Field [0001]<br>
The present invention relates to an absorbent article having an antibacterial function and a method for manufacturing an absorbent element of an absorbent article of this kind. Background Art [0002]<br>
Each of absorbent articles such as tape-fastened or underpants type disposable diapers for infants or adults and sanitary napkins, includes, as basic components, a top sheet on a usage side, a back sheet on a dorsal (back) side for preventing permeation of a liquid, and an absorbent element interposed between these sheets for receiving and retaining an excretory liquid that has permeated through the top sheet.<br>
In addition to these basic components, the absorbent article has appropriately a mode in which an outer sheet made of nonwoven fabric, for example, is disposed on a under side of the back sheet to improve a texture thereof as compared with the back sheet made of plastic, a mode in which barrier cuffs are formed on both sides of an absorbent article, or a mode in which resilient and elastic properties are added for improved fits in waist and ventral portions of a wearer.<br>
Conventional absorbent elements for receiving and retaining a liquid that has permeated through the top sheet on the usage side, generally use accumulated short pulp fibers. In addition, it is known to use high-absorbent polymer particles (hereinafter also referred to as "SAPs") to thereby increase a capacity for absorbing a liquid.<br>
SAPs may be dispersed on accumulated short pulp fibers, or SAPs may be scattered and retained on short pulp fibers , which are then accumulated (Patent Document l).<br>
Contrary to such conventional absorbent bodies, it has been suggested in recent years to use a tow of cellulose acetate as an absorbent element as disclosed in JP 2002-524399 T (W099/27879: Patent Document 2) and JP 2004-500165 T (US Patent No. 6,646,180: Patent Document 3). A tow is a filament assembly in which a large number of filaments are continuous in a predetermined direction, and allows an excretory liquid to<br><br>
be diffused mainly in a direction that fibers are continuous, unlike accumulated short pulp fibers. This brings about an advantage in designing a product with a high degree of diffusibility.<br>
Further, a tow has generally fibers that are thicker than short pulp fibers and made continuous, and thus each of the fibers works with strong elasticity in an absorbent body. Accordingly, even a small volume of tow fibers provides enough strength and elasticity for an absorbent body, which forms a thinner, lighter and softer absorbent body than an absorbent body using short pulp fibers. In recent years, infant children have been in retard out of diapers, and therefore there is a demand for large-sized infant paper diapers using a thinner absorbent body, in consideration of self-esteem of infant children who are developing self-consciousness. Such properties of an absorbent body using a tow meet such a demand. In addition, the properties are also required for paper diapers for elderly people who have started to suffer mild incontinence but can still sufficiently stand on their own feet.<br>
Moreover, there have been recently suggested techniques for imparting deodorant and antibacterial properties to paper diapers and sanitary napkins. For example, JP 8-176338 A (Patent Document 4) discloses an absorbent article in which zeolite is scattered inside each particle of absorbent resin. In addition, JP 12-79159 A (Patent Document 5) discloses a powdery deodorant/antibacterial water-absorbent agent that is formed by water-absorbing resin, a chemical compound having an antibacterial function against ammonia-producing bacteria, and a medical agent having only a neutralizing capacity or both neutralizing and absorptive capacities with respect to ammonia. These features for obscuring incontinence have also been attracting attention as essential factors for large-sized paper diapers for infant children and paper diapers for adults with mild incontinence. Patent Documents JP 2004-65300 A Patent Document 2: JP 2002-524399 T Patent Document 3: JP 2004-500165 T Patent Document 4- JP 8-176338 A Patent Document 5: JP 12-79159 A Disclosure of the Invention Technical Problems to be Solved [0003]<br><br>
However, a tow has thicker and longer fibers than short pulp fibers, and thus an absorbent body having a tow as an absorbent element becomes smaller in total surface area of all fibers thereof as compared with an absorbent body having short pulp fibers as an absorbent element, under the condition that the same weight of fibers are used between them. That is, the absorbent body with a tow cannot hold stably enough amount of particulates such as high-absorbent polymer particles in air gaps between fibers. Therefore, when mixed with particulates in excess of a saturated state, the absorbent body with a tow as an absorbent element cannot hold excessive particulates in a predetermined portion, which causes insufficient performance.<br>
Such large-sized paper diapers for infants and paper diapers for adults with mild incontinence are required to be higher in absorbing capacity than conventional paper diapers for infants, and thus need to contain high-absorbent polymer particles in a high basis weight. Further, if antibacterial particles are also contained therein, the particulates in the filament assembly exceed the saturated state, resulting in the need to solve a problem with a holding capacity.<br>
In addition, if antibacterial particles are contained in the filament assembly, there arises a problem that the filament assembly diffuses an excretory liquid mainly in a direction that fibers are continuous, and therefore the antibacterial particles become less prone to come into contact with the excretory liquid and do not perform properly the antibacterial function.<br>
Accordingly, a main object of the present invention is to allow an absorbent article to offer a high absorbing ability and sufficient antibacterial performance with the use of a filament assembly as an absorbent element. Means to Solve the Problems [0004]<br>
The present invention for solving the foregoing problems is as follows: <invention according to claim><br>
An absorbent article, comprising: a top sheet provided on a usage side thereof; a liquid impervious sheet provided on a back side thereof! and an absorbent element interposed between the top sheet and the liquid<br><br>
impervious sheet, which receives and retains a liquid having permeated thrcmgh the top sheet, wherein<br>
the absorbent element comprises an upper-layer absorbent body positioned on a top sheet side and a lower-layer absorbent body adjacent to an under side of the upper-layer absorbent body,<br>
the upper-layer absorbent body is formed by scattering high-absorbent polymer particles in an filament assembly in which a large number of filaments are continued in a front-back direction of the article, and<br>
the lower-layer absorbent body is formed by scattering antibacterial particles in a fiber assembly[0005] (Operation and effect)<br>
In the present invention, the antibacterial particles are scattered in the fiber assembly of the lower-layer absorbent body adjacent to the under side. Accordingly, an excretory liquid absorbed in the absorbent element moves downward while being diffused along the filaments in the upper-layer absorbent body in the front-back direction of the article, and then is relocated into the lower-layer absorbent body. Much of the excretory liquid is retained in a large area of the lower-layer absorbent body, and thus the excretory liquid is brought into contact with more antibacterial particles. This provides more excellent antibacterial performance as compared with the case where the antibacterial particles are simply scattered in the filament assembly. In addition, the antibacterial particles with a deodorant function would bring about a sufficient deodorizing effect. [0006] <invention according to claim><br>
The absorbent article according to Claim 1, wherein<br>
a sum total of a basis weight of the filament assembly in the upper-layer absorbent body and a basis weight of the fiber assembly in the lower-layer absorbent body is 150 g/m2 or less,<br>
a sum total of a basis weight of the high-absorbent polymer particles in the upper-layer absorbent body and a basis weight of the antibacterial particles in the lower-layer absorbent body is 250 g/m2 or more, and<br>
a weight ratio of the high-absorbent polymer particles to the filament assembly in the upper-layer absorbent body is lower than a weight ratio of the antibacterial particles to the fiber assembly in the lower-layer<br><br>
absorbent body.<br>
[0007]<br>
(Operation and effect)<br>
As stated above, in increasing an entire particle weight, since the weight ratio of the particles to the filament assembly in the upper-layer absorbent body is made lower than the weight ratio of the particles to the fiber assembly in the lower-layer absorbent body, the number of air gaps between fibers is increased in the upper-layer absorbent body, to thereby facilitate movement of an excretory liquid from the upper-layer absorbent body to the lower-layer absorbent body. This allows the absorbent article to be excellent in absorbing property and exerts an antibacterial effect on a larger amount of excretory liquid. [0008] <invention according to claim><br>
The absorbent article according to Claim 1 or 2, wherein a density of filaments in the upper-layer absorbent body is lower than a density of fibers in the lower-layer absorbent body. [0009] (Operation and effect)<br>
The relatively low density of the filaments in the upper-layer absorbent body facilitates movement of an excretory liquid from the upper-layer absorbent body to the lower-layer absorbent body, which allows the absorbent article to exert an antibacterial effect on a larger amount of excretory liquid. [0010] <invention according to claim><br>
The absorbent article according to any one of Claims 1 to 3, wherein the fiber assembly in the lower-layer absorbent body is a short fiber assembly in which a large number of short fibers are assembled. [0011] (Operation and effect)<br>
The short (staple) fiber assembly is inferior to the filament assembly in ability of diffusing an excretory liquid, but is uniform in diffusion direction and diffusing performance and also has high capabilities of retaining an excretory liquid and holding antibacterial particles. Therefore, the short fiber assembly may be used preferably as the lower-layer<br><br>
absorbent body of the present invention, to thereby hold the antibacterial<br>
particles at a high density and diffuse the excretory liquid absorbed in the<br>
lower-layer absorbent body in all directions and in a wide area, so that the<br>
excretory liquid conies into contact with more antibacterial particles.<br>
[0012]<br><invention according to claim><br>
The absorbent article according to Claim 4, wherein the lower-layer absorbent body is an airlaid nonwoven fabric formed by an airlaid method from a mixture of the fibers and the antibacterial particles. [0013] (Operation and effect)<br>
The lower-layer absorbent body as an airlaid nonwoven fabric is further improved in capability of holding the antibacterial particles and can hold the antibacterial particles at a further high density. [0014] <invention according to claim><br>
The absorbent article according to any one of Claims 3 to 5, wherein a particle diameter of the high-absorbent polymer particles contained in the upper-layer absorbent body is 200 m or more, and a particle diameter of the antibacterial particles contained in the lower-layer absorbent body is less than 200 pm. [0015] (Operation and effect)<br>
By setting the particle diameter of the antibacterial particles contained in the lower-layer absorbent body at less than 200 pin, it is possible to make the lower-layer absorbent body in a thin form, thereby achieving an entirely thin absorbent element even with a high-density mixture of the particles.<br>
Further, in manufacture of the article according to this claim, the upper layer absorbent body is provided on the lower layer absorbent body and the high-absorbent polymer particles and the antibacterial particles may be preferably in particular dispersed in mixture or separately onto these absorbent bodies, whereby the high-absorbent polymer particles are held mainly on an upper side of the lower-layer absorbent body (including upper side, interior and lower side of an upper-layer absorbent body 56A), and the antibacterial particles are allowed to pass through the upper-layer<br><br>
absorbent body and be held under the lower-layer absorbent body (including<br>
upper side, interior and lower side of a lower-layer absorbent body 56A).<br>
[0016]<br><invention according to claim><br>
The absorbent article according to any one of Claims 1 to 6, wherein the antibacterial particles in the lower-layer absorbent body are antibacterial deodorant high-absorbent polymer particles. [0017] (Operation and effect)<br>
The absorbent antibacterial particles in the lower-layer absorbent body make it possible to decrease the high-absorbent polymer particles used in the upper-layer absorbent body. [0018] <invention according to claim><br>
The absorbent article according to any one of Claims 1 to 7, wherein the high-absorbent polymer particles in the upper-layer absorbent body are antibacterial deodorant high-absorbent polymer particles. [0019] (Operation and effect)<br>
The antibacterial deodorant high-absorbent polymer particles in the upper-layer absorbent body make it possible to decrease the antibacterial particles used in the lower-layer absorbent body. [0020] <invention according to claim><br>
The absorbent article according to Claim 7 or 8, wherein the antibacterial deodorant high-absorbent polymer particles are formed by: containing in the high-absorbent polymer particles, zeolite particles made by substituting some or all of ion-exchangeable ions in a zeolite with silver ions! or attaching the zeolite particles by static electricity to surfaces of the high-absorbent polymer particles. [0021] (Operation and effect)<br>
The zeolite particles formed by substituting some or all of the ion-exchangeable ions in the zeolite with silver ions may be preferably used to not only produce antibacterial and deodorant effects through contact between the excretory liquid and the silver but also exert a deodorant effect<br><br>
on particles not contacting the excretory liquid by an absorptive action of the zeolite and a catalytic action of the silver. Further, in a preferred mode, the zeolite particles may be contained in the high-absorbent polymer particles, resulting in a higher degree of integration. Alternatively, the zeolite particles may be attached by static electricity to the surfaces of the high-absorbent polymer particles, to thereby provide ease of manufacture and sufficient effectiveness because the entire zeolite particles are exposed to the outside. [0022] • <invention according to claim><br>
The absorbent article according to any one of Claims 1 to 9, wherein the upper-layer absorbent body has an area at a middle portion in a front-back direction of the article, where there is a lower content of the high-absorbent polymer particles than at front and back portions or there exist no high-absorbent polymer particles at all. [0023] (Operation and effect)<br>
In the arrangement according to this claim, an excretory liquid is favorably diffused in the upper-layer absorbent body and preferably absorbed at an improved absorption rate. [0024] <invention according to claim><br>
The absorbent article according to any one of Claims 1 to 10, wherein the lower-layer absorbent body has an area at the middle portion in the front-back direction of the article, where there is a higher content of the antibacterial particles than in the front and back portions. [0025] (Operation and effect)<br>
An excretory liquid concentrates particularly at the middle portion in the front-back direction of the article, and therefore increasing the antibacterial particles at this portion allows the article to be more effective in antibacterial action.<br>
In particular, if the antibacterial particles contained in the lower-layer absorbent body have an absorbing property, the foregoing arrangement improves an absorbing capacity at the middle portion where the excretory liquid concentrates. In addition, even if a content of the high-<br><br>
absorbent polymer particles is lowered or no high-absorbent polymer<br>
particles exist at all at the middle portion of the upper-layer absorbent body<br>
in the front-back direction, it is possible to avoid that the absorbing capacity<br>
of the absorbent body is decreased on the whole at the middle portion.<br>
[0026]<br><invention according to claim><br>
A method for manufacturing an absorbent element, comprising" providing a filament assembly with a large number of filaments continuous in the front-back direction of the article, on a fiber assembly; and dispersing high-absorbent polymer particles with a diameter of 200 m or more and antibacterial particles with a diameter of less than 200 m in mixture or separately onto the filament assembly provided on the fiber assembly. [0027] (Operation and effect)<br>
The manufacturing method realizes easy manufacture of the absorbent element in the present invention. Effect of the Invention [0028]<br>
As stated above, according to the present invention, it is possible to allow an absorbent article to offer a high absorbing ability and sufficient antibacterial performance with the use of a continuous fiber assembly as an absorbent element. Brief Description of Drawings [0029]<br>

One embodiment of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the attached drawings. <example of an underpants type disposable diaper><br>
FIG. 1 illustrates an example of an underpants type disposable diaper. The underpants type disposable diaper 10 includes an outer sheet 12 on an outer surface (back) side and an absorbent main unit 20 on an inner surface (front) side, the absorbent main unit 20 being fixed to the outer sheet 12. The absorbent main unit 20 is a part that receives, absorbs and retains a liquid such as urine and loose stool (menstrual blood for a sanitary napkin described later). The outer sheet 12 is a part that is fitted to the body of a wearer.<br>
The outer sheet 12 has a shape of an hourglass which is constricted on the both sides thereof as shown in the diagram, for example, from which the wearer's legs enter in wearing the diaper. The absorbent main unit 20 may be arbitrarily shaped, and is rectangular in the illustrated mode.<br>
As shown in FIG. 2, the absorbent main unit 20 is placed and fixed at a predetermined position, and then the outer sheet 12 is vertically folded. Then, a front body part 12F and a back body part 12B of the outer sheet 12 are joined together at join areas 12A on both sides by thermal fusing or the like, thereby obtaining an underpants type disposable diaper having a waist opening WO and a pair of right and left leg openings LO as shown in FIG. 1.<br>
A middle portion of the illustrated absorbent main unit 20 in a longitudinal direction (that is, a vertical direction in FIG. 2 and also a front-back direction of the article) is shorter in width than a portion thereof that straddles constricted sections of the outer sheet 12. This relationship in width between the two portions may be reversed or the two portions may be of the same width.<br><br>
The outer sheet 12 is desirably formed by two water-repellent nonwoven fabric sheets, for example, and resilient and elastic members are desirably interposed between these sheets to thereby fit the outer sheet 12 to the body of a wearer by a contraction force of the resilient and elastic members. The resilient and elastic members may use belt-shaped materials such as rubber threads or elastomeric foam, and desirably use a large number of rubber threads. In the illustrated mode, rubber threads 12C, 12C ... are continuously arranged in a waist area W in a width direction, and are arranged in a lower hip area U only at both side portions, and are not arranged in a crotch area L. By arranging the rubber threads 12C, 12C ... in both the waist area W and the lower hip area U, the product preferably fits to the body of a wearer because the outer sheet 12 also contacts the body of the wearer in the lower hip area U even if the rubber threads 12C are weak in contraction force. [0032] (Absorbent main unit)<br>
The absorbent main unit 20, as shown in FIG. 3, includes a liquid pervious top sheet 30, and an absorbent element 50 that absorbs and retains a liquid having permeated through the top sheet. A liquid impervious sheet (also called back sheet) 70 is provided on a back side of the absorbent element 50. The outer sheet 12 is provided on a back side of the liquid impervious sheet 70. Further, the absorbent main unit 20 includes barrier cuffs 60 and 60 on both sides thereof. [0033] (Top sheet)<br>
The top sheet 30 has a property of letting a liquid permeate. Therefore, a material for the top sheet 30 only needs to have liquid perviousness, and may be a porous or nonporous nonwoven fabric or a porous plastic sheet, for example. In addition, there is no particular limitation on raw fibers for use in such a nonwoven fabric. For example, the raw fibers may be any of synthetic fibers based on olefin such as polyethylene or polypropylene, polyester, polyamide, recycled fibers such as rayon or cupra, natural fibers such as cotton, mixed or composite fibers of two or more of the above fibers. Further, the nonwoven fabric may be produced by any processing method. For example, such a processing method may be any known method such as a spun lace method, spun bonding<br><br>
method, thermal bonding method, melt-blown method, needle punching method, air-through method, point bonding method, or the like. For example, if flexibility and drape property are needed, the spun lace method is preferable. If high bulk and softness are required, the thermal bonding method is preferable.<br>
In addition, the top sheet 30 may be a single sheet or a laminated sheet obtained by sticking two or more sheets to each other. Similarly, the top sheet 30 may be a single sheet or two or more sheets in a planar direction. [0034] (Interlayer sheet)<br>
To transfer a liquid having permeated through the top sheet 30 quickly to the absorbent body, an interlayer sheet (also called "second sheet") 40 which is higher in liquid permeability rate than the top sheet 30, may be provided. The interlayer sheet allows a liquid to move quickly to the absorbent body to thereby enhance an absorption performance of the absorbent body, and prevents a "backflow" phenomenon in which a liquid flows back from the absorbent body to thereby keep the top sheet 30 in a dry condition.<br>
The interlayer sheet 40 may use the same material as that for the top sheet 30, or may use a spun lace, a pulp nonwoven fabric, a mixed sheet of pulp and rayon, point-bonded or crepe paper, for example. In particular, an air-through nonwoven fabric and a spun-bonded nonwoven fabric are preferable.<br>
The interlayer sheet (second sheet) 40 is interposed between the top sheet 30 and an envelope sheet 58. As shown in FIG. 5, the interlayer sheet (second sheet) 40 may be omitted in some modes.<br>
Although the interlayer sheet 40 is made shorter in width than the absorbent body 56 and is centered with respect to the absorbent body 56 in the illustrated embodiment, the interlayer sheet 40 may also be provided across a full width of the absorbent body 56. A length of the interlayer sheet 40 in the longitudinal direction may be the same as that of the absorbent body 56, or may be in a shorter range centered in an area for receiving a liquid. A typical material for the interlayer sheet 40 is a highly liquid-pervious nonwoven fabric. [0035]<br><br>
(Absorbent element)<br>
The absorbent element 50 includes, as the absorbent body 56, an upper-layer absorbent body 56A positioned on a top sheet 30 side and a lower-layer absorbent body 56B adjacent to an under side of the upper-layer absorbent body 56. Particularly in the illustrated mode, the absorbent element 50 includes the envelope sheet 58 for covering at least back and side surfaces of the absorbent body 56 and a holding sheet 80 arranged between the absorbent body 56 and a back surface portion (under side) of the envelope sheet 58. [0036] (Upper-layer absorbent body)<br>
The upper-layer absorbent body 56A is formed by an assembly of filaments 52, 52 .... The assembly of filaments 52, 52 ... can be produced by opening a tow (fiber bundle) constituted of filaments (virtually long continuous fibers). The filaments 52 extend in the front-back (longitudinal) direction of the article. [0037]<br>
A basis weight of fibers for use in the upper-layer absorbent body 56A may be decided as appropriate, and for example, may be 50 to 120 g/m2, preferably 60 to 100 g/m2 in particular. If the basis weight of fibers is too small, the high-absorbent polymer becomes prone to drop off from the fibers. If the basis weight of fibers is too large, undesired situations arise where it is impossible to employ a manufacturing method by which the high-absorbent polymer is admitted from outside to inside of the fiber assembly, or where it is difficult to convey the fibers in a manufacturing line, or the like. [0038]<br>
A material for the filament 52 may be any of polysaccharides or derivatives thereof (such as cellulose, cellulose ester, chitin, and chitosan), synthetic polymers (such as polyethylene, polypropylene, polyamide, polyester, polylactamide, and polyvinyl acetate) and the like, for example. In particular, cellulose ester and cellulose are preferable. [0039]<br>
Usable celluloses include celluloses derived from plants such as cotton, linters and wood pulp, bacterial celluloses, and regenerated celluloses such as rayon. Regenerated celluloses may be in the form of spun<br><br>
fibers. [0040]<br>
Preferably used cellulose esters include: organic acid esters such as cellulose acetate, cellulose butyrate, and cellulose propionate.* mixed acid esters such as cellulose acetate propionate, cellulose acetate butyrate, cellulose acetate phthalate, and cellulose nitrate acetate," and cellulose ester derivatives such as polycaprolactone grafted cellulose ester, for example. These cellulose esters may be used singly or in combination. A viscosity average degree of polymerization of a cellulose ester is about 50 to 900 for example, preferably about 200 to 800. An average degree of substitution of a cellulose ester is about 1.5 to 3.0 (e.g. 2 to 3), for example. [0041]<br>
An average degree of polymerization of a cellulose ester may be about 10 to 1,000 for example, preferably about 50 to 900, and more preferably about 200 to 800. An average degree of substitution of a cellulose ester may be about 1 to 3 for example, preferably about 1 to 2.15, and more preferably about 1.1 to 2.0. An average degree of substitution of a cellulose ester may be selected from a viewpoint of enhancing biodegradability. [0042]<br>
Cellulose ester may be an organic acid ester (ester of organic acid with a carbon number of about 2 to 4, for example), and preferably a cellulose acetate in particular. Cellulose acetate has a capacity of absorbing artificial urine about 0.1 to 0.3 times its own weight. An acetylation degree of a cellulose acetate is about 43 to 62% in many cases, and preferably in particular about 30 to 50% with higher biodegradability. A particularly preferable cellulose ester is a cellulose diacetate. [0043]<br>
The filament may contain various additives, for example, a heat stabilization agent, coloring agent, oil solution, retention aid, whiteness improving agent, and the like. [0044]<br>
A fineness of the filaments is 1 to 16 dtex for example, preferably 1 to 10 dtex, and more preferably 1 to 5 dtex. The filaments may be non-crimped fibers but preferably crimped fibers. A degree of crimping of the crimped fibers may be about 5 to 75 crimps per inch, preferably about 10 to 50 crimps per inch, and more preferably about 15 to 50 crimps per inch. In<br><br>
many cases, uniformly crimped fibers are used. By using such crimped fibers, it is possible to produce a high-integration tow due to fiber entanglement, and manufacture a high-bulk, light-weight absorbent body. There is no particular limitation on a cross-section shape of the filaments, and the filaments may be circular, elliptic, odd (Y, X, I, or R letter, for example) or hollow in cross section, for example. Such filaments are formed by a tow (fiber bundle) of about 3,000 to 1,000,000 single fibers for example, preferably about 5,000 to 1,000,000 single fibers. Such a fiber bundle is preferably formed by binding about 3,000 to 1,000,000 continuous fibers. [0045]<br>
Since a tow is weak in filament entanglement, a binder having the action of attaching or fusing contacted portions in the filaments may be used mainly for the purpose of maintaining the shape of the tow. The binder may be any of ester-based plasticizers such as triacetin, triethyleneglycol diacetate, triethyleneglycol dipropionate, dibutyl phthalate, dimethoxyethyl phthalate, and triethyl ester citrate, and various types of resin adhesives, in particular thermoplastic resins. [0046]<br>
Thermoplastic resins to be used as a binder develop an adhesive property through fusion and solidification, and include water-insoluble or poorly water-soluble resins and water-soluble resins. Water-insoluble or poorly water-soluble resins and water-soluble resins may be used in combination as required. [0047]<br>
Such water-insoluble or poorly water-soluble resins include; olefin-based homopolymers or copolymers such as polyethylene, polypropylene, ethylene-propylene copolymer, ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer,' acrylic resins such as polyvinyl chloride, polymethyl methacrylate, methyl methacrylate-acrylic ester copolymer, (meth)acrylic and styrene monomer copolymer; styrene copolymers such as polyvinyl chloride, vinyl acetate-vinyl chloride copolymer, polystyrene, and styrene monomer-(meth)acrylic monomer copolymer; polyamides such as polyester that may be modified, nylon 11, nylon 12, nylon 610 and nylon 612,' rosin derivatives (e.g. rosin ester); hydrocarbon resins (e.g. terpene resin, dicyclopentadiene resin, and petroleum resin); hydrogenated hydrocarbon resins. These thermoplastic resins may be used singly or in combination.<br><br>
[0048]<br>
The water-soluble resins include various water-soluble polymers, for example: vinyl water-soluble resin, such as copolymers between polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, polyvinyl ether, or vinyl monomer, and carboxyl group, sulphonate group, or copolymerizable monomers having salts thereof, acrylic water-soluble resin, polyalkylene oxide, water-soluble polyester, and water-soluble polyamide,. These water-soluble resins may be used singly or in combination. [0049]<br>
The thermoplastic resins may be mixed with various additives such as stabilizing agents including antioxidant and ultraviolet absorber, filling agents, plasticizing agents, antiseptic agents, and antifungal agents. [0050]<br>
A tow can be produced by a publicly known method and thus will not be described in detail here. Bales of a tow of cellulose diacetate preferably used in the absorbent element 50 are made commercially available by Celanese Corp., Daicel Chemical Industries, Ltd., and others. A bale of a tow of cellulose diacetate is about 0.5 g/cm3 in density and 400 to 600 kg in gross weight. [0051]<br>
The tow is peeled off from the bale and opened in a wide band-like form of desired size and bulk. An opening width of the tow can be arbitrarily decided, for example 100 to 2,000 mm, preferably about 100 to 300 mm, so as to be adapted to the width of the absorbent body in the product. In addition, the density of the absorbent body can be adjusted by controlling a degree of tow opening. [0052]<br>
There is a method for tow opening by which a tow is laid over a plurality of opening rolls and is opened with a gradual increase in width according to travel of the tow. There are also a method by which a tow is opened by repeated tightening (expansion) and loosening (contraction), and a method by which a tow is increased in width and opened through compressed air. [0053]<br>
Meanwhile, in the upper-layer absorbent body 56A, high-absorbent polymer particles 54, 54 ... are scattered among fibers as shown in FIG. 3.<br><br>
In this case, the high-absorbent polymer particles (SAP particles) 54 are desirably scattered in a virtually overall thickness direction of the upper-layer absorbent body 56A. FIG. 3 is a conceptual enlarged view of main parts in such a state as described above. If there are no or few if any, SAP particles 54 in upper, lower and middle portion of the upper-layer absorbent body 56A, it is not recognized that "the SAP particles are scattered in the overall thickness direction." Therefore, the "scattered in the overall thickness direction" state refers to a mode in which the particles are scattered "evenly" in the overall thickness direction with respect to the upper-layer absorbent body 56A, or a mode in which the particles are "unevenly distributed" in the upper, lower and/or middle portions but still are scattered in the upper, lower and/or middle portions. In addition, the foregoing state does not exclude a mode in which some of the SAP particles remain on a surface of the upper-layer absorbent body 56A, or a mode in which some of the SAP particles drop off from the upper-layer absorbent body 56A and exist on the envelope sheet 58 or on the lower-layer absorbent body adjacent to the under side or on the holding sheet 80, as shown in FIG. 3. [0054]<br>
The high-absorbent polymer particles 54 may be not only "particles" but also "powders". A particle diameter of the high-absorbent polymer particles 54 may be the same as that of particles used in this kind of absorbent articles, and is 200 to 1,000 m, desirably in particular 200 to 400 m. There are no particular limits on a material for the high-absorbent polymer particles 54, and a preferred material is 40 g/g or more in capacity of water absorption. The high-absorbent polymer particles 54 may be based on starch, cellulose or synthetic polymer, and may use starch-acrylic acid (salt) graft copolymer, saponified product of starch-acrylonitrile copolymer, cross-linked sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, acrylic acid (salt) polymer, or the like. A shape of the high-absorbent polymer particles 54 is preferably a commonly used particulate shape, and may also be any other shape. Further, the high-absorbent polymer particles 54 in the upper-layer absorbent body 56A may be antibacterial deodorant high-absorbent polymer particles described later. [0055]<br>
The high-absorbent polymer particles 54 preferably deliver a water<br><br>
absorption speed of 40 seconds or less. If the water absorption speed exceeds 40 seconds, a backflow phenomenon becomes prone to occur, where a liquid having been supplied to the absorbent body 56 flows back out of the absorbent body. [0056]<br>
In addition, the high-absorbent polymer particles 54 are preferably 1,000 Pa or more in gel strength. This prevents effectively a sticky feel after liquid absorption. [0057]<br>
A basis weight of the high-absorbent polymer particles 54 in the upper-layer absorbent body 56Amay be decided as appropriate in accordance with a required absorption capacity, and may be 50 to 350 g/m2, preferably in particular 150 to 350 g/m2, although not be always defined so. If the basis weight of the high-absorbent polymer particles 54 is less than 50 g/m2, it is difficult to deliver the absorption capacity. If the basis weight exceeds 350 g/m2, the high-absorbent polymer particles 54 become saturated in effectiveness and an excessive amount thereof has an unpleasant grainy feel when touching to the product. [0058]<br>
If necessary, the high-absorbent polymer particles 54 can be adjusted in dispersing density or dispersing amount in the planar direction of the upper-layer absorbent body 56A. For example, a dispersing amount may be made larger at a portion for an excretory liquid than other portions. With regard to a difference between the sexes, the dispersion density (amount) may be increased at the front side portion for men while at the middle portion for women. [0059]<br>
In contrast, as shown in FIG. 7, the upper-layer absorbent body 56A may have a local portion X with no or few high-absorbent polymer particles 54 (in spots, for example) in the planar direction thereof. In particular, this portion X is desirably positioned at a middle portion in the front-back direction of the article. An area of the middle portion X in the front-back direction can be decided as appropriate, and may cover about 50 to 60% of an entire length of the upper-layer absorbent body 56A. An amount of the high-absorbent polymer particles in the middle portion X can be decided as appropriate, and preferably is smaller by 20 weight % or more as compared<br><br>
with amounts of those in the front and rear portions. [0060]<br>
Further, the upper-layer absorbent body 56A may contain antibacterial particles according to circumstances. In this case, the antibacterial particles can be of the same kind as those in the lower-layer absorbent body, and can be used in the same method as that for the lower-layer absorbent body. [0061] (Lower-layer absorbent body)<br>
The lower-layer absorbent body 56B is formed by scattering the antibacterial particles 51 in a fiber assembly. The fiber assembly may be a filament assembly similar to that in the upper-layer absorbent body 56A, and preferably is a short fiber assembly in which a large number of short fibers 55 are assembled irregularly or regularly to thereby hold the antibacterial particles at a high density. The short fiber assembly may be a nonwoven fabric or fluff pulp obtained by accumulating pulp fibers. The absorbent body 56B can be produced by using a mixture of the short fibers 55 and the antibacterial particles 51, or by dispersing the antibacterial particles 51 in a previously produced assembly of short fibers 55.<br>
The term "short fibers" in the present invention refers to all fibrous materials other than long fibers in which fibers are continuous in a web, and includes not only general synthetic fibers of about 2 to 90 mm in fiber length, but also pulp fibers of 2 mm or less in fiber length. [0062]<br>
A material for the short fibers 55 may be any of synthetic fibers based on olefin such as polyethylene or polypropylene, polyester, and polyamide, regenerated fibers such as rayon and cupra, natural fibers such as cotton, linen and pulp. The material may be hydrophilic or hydrophobic, and in particular hydrophilic fibers are preferable in the point of an excellent capability of supplying a liquid to the antibacterial particles 51. [0063]<br>
If a nonwoven fabric is used as a short fiber assembly, there is no particular limitation on a method for manufacturing the nonwoven fabric. Any appropriate method can be used to manufacture a short fiber nonwoven fabric such as an air-through nonwoven fabric, resin-bonded nonwoven fabric, air-laid nonwoven fabric, spun lace nonwoven fabric, heat-rolled<br><br>
nonwoven fabric, thermal-bonded nonwoven fabric, or needle-punched nonwoven fabric. Particularly preferred is an air-laid nonwoven fabric with a high capability of holding antibacterial particles. In addition, the nonwoven fabric may be a laminated nonwoven fabric in which a single kind or different kinds of plural nonwoven fabrics are laminated. [0064]<br>
A basis weight of fibers for use in the lower-layer absorbent body 56B can be decided as appropriate, and may be 20 to 80 g/m2 for example, preferably in particular 30 to 60 g/m2. If the basis weight of fibers is too small, the antibacterial particles become prone to drop off from the fibers. If the basis weight of fibers is too large, undesired situations arise where it is impossible to employ a manufacturing method by which the antibacterial particles are admitted from outside to inside of the fiber assembly, or where it is difficult to convey the fibers in a manufacturing line, or the like.<br>
A basis weight of the antibacterial particles 51 in the lower-layer absorbent body 56B can be decided at appropriate, and may be 25 to 200 g/m2, preferably in particular 60 to 100 g/m2. [0065]<br>
Meanwhile, there is no particular limitation on the antibacterial particles 51 insofar as the same exerts an antibacterial effect in contact with an excretory liquid. The antibacterial particles 51 may be any of various types of non-absorbent inorganic particles, although the antibacterial particles 51 are preferably formed by integrating high-absorbent polymer and an antibacterial substance as described in Patent Document 5. Particularly preferred are antibacterial deodorant high-absorbent polymer particles that are formed by containing zeolite particles prepared by substituting some or all of ion-exchangeable ions in a zeolite (hereinafter referred to as "antibacterial deodorant zeolite") with silver ions, in the high-absorbent polymer, or by attaching antibacterial deodorant zeolite particles by static electricity to surfaces of the high-absorbent polymer particles. [0066]<br>
The antibacterial deodorant zeolite may be a natural or synthetic zeolite, and is preferably a synthetic zeolite from the viewpoint of costs and stable availability. Zeolite is an aluminosilicate of a three-dimensional framework structure and may be preferably expressed by a general formula M2/nO- •Na2O-Al2O3*2.5SiO2,xH20. In the formula, x denotes an integer<br><br>
indicating the number of crystallization waters, and M denotes cations. The cations M preferably contain silver ions and zinc ions. In the formula, n denotes an atomic value of the cation. Specific examples of a zeolite include A-type zeolite, X-type zeolite, Y-type zeolite, T-type zeolite, high-silica zeolite and the like. Preferred are A-type zeolite, X-type zeolite and Y-type zeolite, and particularly preferred is A-type zeolite from the viewpoint of an excellent deodorizing effect. [0067]<br>
There is no particular limitation on a particle diameter of the zeolite, and an average particle diameter of the same is generally 0.1 to 10 m, preferably 0.3 to 5 m, and in particular preferably 0.6 to 2.5 m. The excessively small average particle diameter makes the zeolite hard to handle, and the excessively large average particle diameter decreases a surface area of the zeolite and thus depresses a deodorizing effect. [0068]<br>
A pore diameter of porous particles such as a zeolite is generally 1 to 10 angstroms, preferably 3 to 10 angstroms in particular, from the viewpoint of a surface area. The excessively large pore diameter makes the particles less effective due to a decrease in surface area. The excessively small pore diameter degrades the particles in capability of absorbing an odor-emitting substance with a large molecular diameter. [0069]<br>
The antibacterial deodorant zeolite may be Zeomic (registered trademark) from Sinanen Zeomic Co., Ltd. [0070]<br>
An amount of the antibacterial deodorant zeolite to be added to the high-absorbent polymer can be decided as appropriate, and preferably is 500 ppm or more, more preferably 500 to 3,000 ppm, on a weight ratio basis. The excessively small amount of added antibacterial deodorant zeolite produces an insufficient antibacterial deodorant effect, and the excessively large amount of the same makes it difficult to integrate the antibacterial particles into a polymer. [0071]<br>
A usage amount of the antibacterial particles 51 can be appropriately decided depending on performance of the antibacterial particles 51, the kind and size of the absorbent article, and target<br><br>
absorption performance (for example, the usage amount may be increased for adult diapers). Particularly if the high-absorbent polymer particles with the antibacterial deodorant zeolite are used in paper diapers, the antibacterial deodorant zeolite is preferably contained by 0.02 to 2.0 weight % per one diaper. The excessively small amount of the antibacterial substance produces an insufficient antibacterial effect, and the excessively large amount of the same reduces cost effectiveness. [0072]<br>
If necessary, the antibacterial particles 51 may be adjusted in dispersing density or dispersing amount in the planar direction of the lower-layer absorbent body 56B. For example, the dispersing amount may be made larger at a portion for an excretory liquid than other portions. FIG. 7 illustrates such a case where the antibacterial particles 51 are increased at a middle portion X in the front-back direction of the lower-layer absorbent body 56B, as compared to the front and back portions. An area of the middle portion X in the front-back direction can be decided as appropriate, and may cover about 50 to 60% of an entire length of the lower-layer absorbent body 56B. Particularly, if the antibacterial particles 51 contained in the lower-layer absorbent body 56B has an absorbing property, this arrangement improves an absorbing capacity at the middle portion where an excretory liquid concentrates. In this case, even if the upper-layer absorbent body 56A has a lower content of the high-absorbent polymer particles 54 or no high-absorbent polymer particles 54 at all at the middle portion in the front-back direction as stated above, it is possible to prevent a decrease in absorbing capacity at the middle portion on the whole in the absorbent element 50. [0073]<br>
In contrast, if the non-absorbent antibacterial particles 51 are used (for example, the antibacterial deodorant zeolite is used alone, not contained in the high-absorbent polymer), the lower-layer absorbent body 56B may contain separately high-absorbent polymer as required. In this case, the separate high-absorbent polymer may be the same as those in the upper-layer absorbent body 56A. In addition, if both the upper-layer absorbent body 56A and the lower-layer absorbent body 56B contain high-absorbent polymer particles, the basis weights of the high-absorbent polymer particles may be the same or different between the two layers. [0074]<br><br>
(Absorbent body)<br>
In the absorbent body 56, the upper-layer absorbent body 56A and the lower-layer absorbent body 56B may not be fixed to each other insofar as the two bodies are adjacent to each other, but preferably are joined to each other by a joining means as a hot-melt adhesive, triacetin, binder, or heat. [0075]<br>
In large-sized paper diapers for infants and paper diapers for adults with mild incontinence, the absorbent body 56 is preferably high in particle content. For example, it is preferable to set a sum total of the basis weight of filaments in the upper-layer absorbent body 56A and the basis weight of fibers in the lower-layer absorbent body 56B at 150 g/m2 or less, and set a sum total of the basis weight of the high-absorbent polymer particles 54 in the upper-layer absorbent body 56A and the basis weight of the antibacterial particles 51 in the lower-layer absorbent body 56B at 250 g/m2 or more. In this case, however, if a weight ratio of the high-absorbent polymer particles 54 to the filament assembly in the upper-layer absorbent body 56Ais higher than that of the antibacterial particles 51 to the fiber assembly in the lower-layer absorbent body 56B, air gaps between fibers are decreased and thus it becomes difficult to move an excretory liquid from the upper-layer absorbent body 56A to the lower-layer absorbent body 56B. Accordingly, it is preferable to set a weight ratio of the high-absorbent polymer particles 54 to the filament assembly in the upper-layer absorbent body 56A so as to be lower than that of the antibacterial particles 51 to the fiber assembly in the lower-layer absorbent body 56B. [0076]<br>
To facilitate movement of an excretory liquid from the upper-layer absorbent body 56A to the lower-layer absorbent body 56B, a density of filaments in the upper-layer absorbent body 56A is preferably lower than that of fibers in the lower-layer absorbent body 56B. Specifically, the filament assembly in the upper-layer absorbent body 56A may be 60 to 100 g/m2 in basis weight of fibers and 1 to 10 mm in thickness, and the fiber assembly in the lower-layer absorbent body 56B may be 30 to 60 g/m2 in basis weight of fibers and 0.2 to 2 mm in thickness. [0077]<br>
The absorbent body 56 can be produced by laminating the separately prepared upper-layer absorbent body 56A and lower-layer absorbent body<br><br>
56B, for example. [0078]<br>
In addition, by setting a fineness and basis weight of fibers and thickness of fiber assemblies for use in the upper-layer absorbent body 56A and lower-layer absorbent body 56B, a particle diameter of the high-absorbent polymer particles 54 and a particle diameter of the antibacterial particles within specific ranges, it is possible to employ a manufacturing mode in which the filament assembly for use in the upper-layer absorbent body 56A and the fiber assembly for use in the lower-layer absorbent body 56B are separately prepared and laminated to each other, and then the high-absorbent polymer particles 54 and the antibacterial particles 51 are dispersed in mixture or separately on the laminate. [0079]<br>
Specifically, the filament assembly in the upper-layer absorbent body 56A is 1 to 16 dtex, particularly 1 to 5 dtex in fineness of fibers, 60 to 100 g/m2 in basis weight of fibers, and 1 to 10 mm in thickness. The fiber assembly in the lower-layer absorbent body 56B is 1 to 16 dtex, particularly 1 to 5 dtex in fineness of fibers, 30 to 60 g/m2 in basis weight of fibers, and 0.2 to 2 mm in thickness. In addition, the high-absorbent polymer particles contained in the upper-layer absorbent body 56A are 200 pm or more, particularly 250 m or more in particle diameter. The antibacterial particles 51 contained in the lower-layer absorbent body 56B are less than 200 m particularly less than 50 m in particle diameter. By setting the particle diameter of the antibacterial particles 51 at less than 200 m the lower-layer absorbent body 56B can be made in a thin form even with a high-density mixture of particles, thereby advantageously achieving an entirely thin absorbent element. [0080]<br>
Accordingly, by laminating the upper-layer absorbent body 56A and the lower-layer absorbent body 56B and then dispersing the high-absorbent polymer particles and the antibacterial particles in mixture or separately on the upper-layer absorbent body 56A, the high-absorbent polymer particles are mainly held on the upper side of the lower-layer absorbent body 56B (including upper side, interior and lower side of the upper-layer absorbent body 56A), and the antibacterial particles are passed through the upper-layer absorbent body 56A and held under the lower-layer absorbent body<br><br>
56B (including the upper side, interior and lower side of the lower-layer<br>
absorbent body 56A).<br>
[0081]<br>
In the upper-layer absorbent body 56A, if air gaps between filaments are excessively large due to too narrow filaments, too small basis weight of filaments or too thin filament assembly, or if each of the high-absorbent polymer particles is excessively small, the high-absorbent polymer particles become prone to drop off from the filament assembly. In contrast, if air gaps between filaments are excessively small due to too thick filaments, too large basis weight of filaments or too thick filament assembly, or if each of the high-absorbent polymer particles is excessively large or each of the antibacterial particles is excessively large, there arise undesired situations where it is difficult to admit the high-absorbent polymer particles 54 into the filament assembly, it is difficult to pass the antibacterial particles through the upper-layer absorbent body 56A, and it is also difficult to convey these materials in a manufacturing line. [0082]<br>
Moreover, in the lower-layer absorbent body 56B, if air gaps between fibers are excessively large due to too narrow fibers, too small basis weight of fibers or too thin fiber assembly, or if the antibacterial particles are excessively small, the antibacterial particles become prone to drop off from the fiber assembly. If in reverse, there arise undesired situations where it is difficult to admit the antibacterial particles into the fiber assembly and it is also difficult to convey these materials in a manufacturing line. [0083]<br>
Further, setting finenesses of the upper-layer absorbent body 56A and lower-layer absorbent body 56B within the foregoing ranges makes the absorbent article feel soft. [0084] (Envelope sheet)<br>
The envelope sheet 58 may use any of materials such as tissue paper, particularly crepe paper, nonwoven fabrics, polyethylene-laminated nonwoven fabrics, foraminous sheets, and the like. The sheet desirably does not let high-absorbent polymer particles pass through. In using a nonwoven fabric instead of crepe paper in the envelope sheet 58, a hydrophilic SMMS (spun bonded/melt-blown/melt-blown/spun-bonded) nonwoven fabric is<br><br>
preferred in particular. A material for such a fabric may be polypropylene, polyethylene/polypropylene, or the like. A basis weight of the fabric is 8 to 20 g/m2, desirably 10 to 15 g/m2 in particular.<br>
The envelope sheet 58 is preferably formed from a fiber assembly with a larger capacity of absorbing artificial urine than that of a filament assembly such as a fiber assembly with a capacity of absorbing artificial urine of about 5 to 30 times larger, to thereby complement water-absorbing performance of the absorbent body 56 and improve an initial absorption rate and a diffusing property.<br>
The envelope sheet 58 may be configured as to envelop the overall absorbent body 56 as shown in FIG. 3 or may envelop only back and side surfaces of the layer as shown in FIG. 4, for example. Further, although not shown, the envelope sheet 58 may be configured as. to cover the upper and side surfaces of the absorbent body 56 with crepe paper or a nonwoven fabric and cover the lower surface of the absorbent body 56 with a liquid-impervious sheet of polyethylene or as to cover the upper surface of the absorbent body 56 with a crape paper or nonwoven fabric and side and lower surfaces of the absorbent body 56 with a liquid-impervious sheet of polyethylene. (The foregoing materials are constitutional elements of the envelope sheet). If necessary, the envelope sheet 58 may be configured in such a manner that two upper and lower sheets sandwich the absorbent body 56 therebetween or that one sheet is disposed only on the lower surface of the same. However, these configurations are not desired because they make it difficult to prevent movement of the high-absorbent polymer particles. [0085] (Holding sheet)<br>
The high-absorbent polymer particles 54 and the antibacterial particles 51 may drop off from the absorbent body 56 in a manufacturing process or in the course of distribution to consumers. The dropped high-absorbent polymer particles may bring an unpleasant grainy feel with asperities thereof to a user who touches the product by hand. To solve this problem, it is preferable to interpose the holding sheet 80 capable of holding particles between the absorbent body 56 and a back surface portion (lower side) of the envelope sheet 58. The holding sheet 80 increases elasticity which would be insufficiently provided only by the envelope sheet 58 made<br><br>
of tissue paper (crepe paper) or the like, and reduces or prevents an unpleasant feel from being given to a user who touches the product by hand.<br>
There is no particular limitation on a material for the holding sheet 80, and such a material only needs to be capable of holding particles. Specifically, the material may be any of nonwoven fabrics, crimped pulp, lowabsorbent cotton fibers (e.g. fat cotton fibers, defatted cotton fibers, rayon fibers processed with a water repellent agent or a hydrophobizing agent), polyethylene fibers, polyester fibers, acrylic fibers, polypropylene fibers, silk, cotton, hemp, nylon, polyurethane, acetate fibers, and the like.<br>
If the holding sheet 80 is formed by a nonwoven fabric, the holding sheet 80 is 0.01 to 10.00 gfcm/cm2, preferably 0.01 to 1.00 gfcm/cm2 in compression energy, and is 10 to 100%, preferably 70 to 100% in compression resilience, based on test results from KES Test.<br>
A purpose of providing the holding sheet 80 is to hold the high-absorbent polymer particles 54 and the like which have dropped (slipped) downward from the absorbent body 56, for example. Therefore, the dropped particles come into contact with a user via the envelope sheet 58 and the holding sheet 80, and thus there is no fear of giving the user an unpleasant grainy feel. In particular, the nonwoven fabric within the above-mentioned ranges of compression energy and compression resilience can perform sufficiently function thereof.<br>
In addition, since the slipped particles are held by the holding sheet 80 and thus does not move over the envelope sheet 58, there is no fear of uneven absorption capabilities. Particularly, to prevent movement of the particles over the holding sheet 80, the holding sheet 80 may be coated in advance with a sticky hot-melt adhesive or the like. Alternatively, to prevent movement of the particles over the holding sheet 80, the upper surface of the holding sheet 80 (facing to the absorbing side of the absorbent body 56) may be made rough. For this purpose, a nonwoven fabric may be manufactured in such a manner that a surface thereof is roughed or fluffed by making non-netted in producing the nonwoven fabric, marbling, needle-punching, or brushing.<br>
The holding sheet 80 may be provided only underneath the absorbent body 56 as shown in FIG. 3 and others, or may pass by the absorbent body 56 along its side, roll and extend up to the upper surface of the absorbent body 56 as shown in FIG. 7. In addition, a plurality of<br><br>
stacked holding sheets 80 may be used.<br>
Although, in the above example, the holding sheet 80 is disposed between the absorbent body 56 and a back side potion of the envelope sheet 58, the holding sheet 80 may be placed behind the back side of the envelope sheet 58 instead (this arrangement is not shown). The important point is that providing the holding sheet 80 behind the absorbent body 56 reduces or eliminates an unpleasant grainy feel which would be given to a user who touches the product from the back side thereof.<br>
If the holding sheet 80 is provided between the absorbent body 56 and the liquid impervious sheet 70, the holding sheet 80 is preferably formed by a fiber assembly with a larger capacity of absorbing artificial urine than that of a filament assembly such as a fiber assembly with a capacity of absorbing artificial urine of about 5 to 30 times larger, to thereby complement water-absorbing performance of the absorbent body 56 and improve an initial absorption rate and a diffusing property. [0086] (Liquid-impervious sheet)<br>
The liquid-impervious sheet 70 is arranged on the back side of the absorbent body 56, and the absorbent element 50 is interposed between this sheet and the top sheet 30. There is no particular limitation on a material for the liquid impervious sheet 70 as far as the liquid impervious sheet 70 does not let a liquid permeate. Such a material may be any of olefin resins such as polyethylene and polypropylene, laminated nonwoven fabrics in which a nonwoven fabric is laminated on a polyethylene sheet or the like, and nonwoven fabrics to which a water-proof film is interposed to thereby provide virtual liquid-imperviousness (in this case, the water-proof film and the nonwoven fabric constitute a liquid impervious sheet). Certainly, in addition to the foregoing, it is possible to cite examples of a liquid impervious and moisture pervious sheet that has been favorably used in recent years from the viewpoint of prevention of stuffiness. Such a sheet made of a liquid impervious and moisture pervious material may be a microporous sheet obtained by melting and kneading an inorganic filling agent into an olefin resin such as polyethylene or polypropylene to thereby form a sheet and then stretching the sheet in a uniaxial or biaxial direction, for example.<br>
It is possible to prevent a liquid from laterally permeating by letting<br><br>
the liquid impervious sheet 70 wrap around the sides and extend up to the usage side (not shown). In this embodiment, lateral leakage is prevented by-interposing a second liquid impervious sheet 72 in the double barrier sheet 64 forming barrier cuffs 60. That is, since the second liquid impervious sheet 72 extends up to erected portions of the barrier cuffs 60, it is possible to prevent that a liquid laterally diffuses along the top sheet 30 and loose stool between the barrier cuffs 60 and 60 penetrate in the lateral direction. [0087] (Barrier cuffs)<br>
The barrier cuffs 60, 60 on the both sides of the article are intended to prevent that urine or loose stool moves and leaks laterally over the top sheet 30. The illustrated barrier cuffs 60 are formed by laminating the two water-repellent nonwoven fabric sheets so as to cover from the back surface of the absorbent body 56 to a downward folded portion of the top sheet 30 and project toward the front surface of the absorbent body 56. To block urine moving laterally over the top sheet 30, the liquid-impervious sheet 70 is inserted at side portions into the two laminated nonwoven fabric sheet and extended up to midpoints in the barrier cuffs 60 projecting toward the front surface.<br>
In addition, the barrier cuffs 60 can be designed in shape as appropriate. In the illustrated example, the barrier cuffs 60 and 60 are each fixed in such a manner that front and back ends thereof are folded and a middle portion thereof in the front-back direction is not fixed, and resilient and elastic members, for example, rubber threads 62 are fixed along the front-back direction in a stretched state at leading edges and middle portions of the barrier cuffs 60 in a direction of projection. While the article is being used, the barrier cuffs 60 are erected by a contraction force of the resilient and elastic members. [0088] (Others)<br>
Although not shown, constitutional members of the absorbent main unit 20 can be fixed to one another through solid, bead or spiral application of a hot-melt adhesive or the like. [0089] (Example of a tape-fastened disposable diaper)<br>
FIGs. 5 and 6 illustrate an example of a tape-fastened disposable<br><br>
diaper. FIG. 6 is a view on arrow of FIG. 5 taken along a line 9-9, although the absorbent main unit 20 is shown in a slightly exaggerated manner. [0090]<br>
The tape-fastened disposable diaper 10A has fastening pieces at both ends on the dorsal side of the diaper and hook elements on a surface to which the fastening pieces are attached. In addition, the diaper 10A has a back sheet that is formed by a nonwoven laminate and constitutes a back side of the diaper. In wearing the diaper, the hook elements in the fastening pieces can be engaged at arbitrary sections on the front side of the back sheet. [0091]<br>
The absorbent main unit 20 includes the absorbent element 50 between the top sheet 30 and the liquid impervious sheet 70. The absorbent element 50 includes, as the absorbent body 56, the upper-layer absorbent body 56A and the lower-layer absorbent body 56B which are adjacent to each other. The absorbent body 56 is entirely enveloped in the envelope sheet 58 and is rectangular in shape from a planar view. The holding sheet 80 is disposed between the absorbent body 56 and the envelope sheet 58. [0092]<br>
Further, the interlayer sheet 40 is interposed between the top sheet 30 and the absorbent body 56. The liquid impervious sheet 70 is of a rectangle wider than the absorbent body 56, and the hourglass-shaped back sheet 12A made of a nonwoven fabric is provided on an outside of the liquid impervious sheet 70. [0093]<br>
The top sheet 30 is of a rectangle wider than the absorbent body 56, is extended slightly laterally to side edges of the absorbent body 56, and fixed to the liquid impervious sheet 70 by a hot-melt adhesive or the like. [0094]<br>
The barrier cuffs 60A projecting toward the usage side, are provided on the both sides of the diaper. The barrier cuffs 60A each include^ a barrier sheet 64 of a nonwoven fabric continuous in a virtually width direction! and a resilient and elastic member, for example, a rubber thread 62 as one or more around-leg resilient and elastic members made of a rubber thread. Reference numeral 130 denotes fastening pieces in a hook and loop fastener. [0095]<br><br>
The barrier sheet 64 has adhesion start ends in an inner surface thereof at positions separated from the side edges of the top sheet 30. The barrier sheet 64 is adhered at portions laterally extending from the adhesion start ends to the extending edges of the liquid-impervious sheet 70 with a hot-melt adhesive or the like. The barrier sheet 64 is also adhered in an outer surface on a lower side thereof to the back sheet 12A with a holt-melt adhesive or the like. Further, the barrier sheet 64 has resilient and elastic members for gasket cuffs, for example, rubber threads 66. [0096]<br>
The adhesion start ends in the inner surface of the barrier sheet 64 to the liquid impervious sheet 70, constitute erected ends of the barrier cuffs 60A. Around the leg portions, the barrier cuffs 60 each has a free portion on an inner side of the erected end, which is not fixed to the main body of the article and is erected by a contraction force of the rubber threads 62. [0097]<br>
In this example, the hook and loop fasters as the fastening pieces 130 are used for mechanical fastening to the back sheet 12A. Therefore, the target tapes can be omitted, and fastening positions of the fastening pieces 130 can be freely selected. [0098]<br>
Each of the fastening piece 130 has a base of a fastening material such as plastic, polyethylene-laminated nonwoven fabric, paper or the like which is attached to the back sheet 12A with an adhesive, and also has a hook element 130A at a leading end thereof. The hook member 130A is attached to the fastening base material with an adhesive. The hook member 130A has a large number of engagement projections on an outer surface thereof. Each of the fastening pieces 130 has a temporary fastening adhesive portion 130B at a leading end of the hook element 130A. The temporary fastening adhesive portion 130B is attached to the barrier sheet 64 at a final stage of manufacture of the article, which prevents the fastening piece 130 from being separated from the leading end. In using the diaper, the fastening piece 130 is separated from the barrier sheet 64 against an adhesion force of the temporary fastening adhesive portion 130B, and the leading end of the fastening piece 130 is pulled toward the front body part. A leading end of the temporary fastening adhesive portion 130B constitutes a pickup tab at which the fastening base material is exposed.<br><br>
[0099]<br>
A target printed sheet 74 as a design sheet is provided on the inner surface of the back sheet 12A at an opening portion of the front body part, in which positional guides for fastening the hook elements 130A of the fastening pieces 130 are printed so as to be visible from outside through the back sheet 12. [0100]<br>
When a wearer has a diaper on, the diaper is fitted in a boat-like shape to the body of the wearer, and the barrier cuffs 60A are erected around the legs of the wearer by the contraction force of the rubber threads 62. [0101]<br>
The erected portions surround a space for containing urine or loose stool. When urine is discharged into the space, the urine permeates through the top sheet 30 and then is absorbed into the absorbent body 56. Solid contents of loose stool are retained in the space by the erected portions of the barrier cuffs 60A as barriers. If urine goes over an erected distal side edge of the erected portion and starts to leak in a lateral direction, a planar contact portion stops the urine and prevents further lateral leakage. [0102]<br>
In this embodiment, the barrier sheet 64 forming the erected cuffs is desirably not liquid-pervious but virtually liquid-impervious (or semi-liquid-pervious). Alternatively, the face sheet of the present invention (nonwoven laminate) may be silicon-processed so as to have a property of repelling a liquid. In either case, the barrier sheet 64 and the back sheet 12A have air permeability, and are preferably 100 mmH20 or more in water-resistance pressure. This provides the article with air permeability at side portions in the width direction, thereby preventing stuffiness in the wearer. [0103]<br>
Other features, for example, materials for the constituent members are the same as those of the foregoing underpants type paper diaper, and thus descriptions thereof will be omitted here. Industrial Applicability [0104]<br>
The present invention is suitable for absorbent articles such as paper diapers, sanitary napkins, incontinence pads, and absorbent pads<br><br>
used with diaper covers.<br><br>
