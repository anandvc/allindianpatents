To  the  knowledge  of  the  Applicant,   the compounds of formula (I) are novel with the exception'<br><br>
- 4 -<br>
of a-guanidinoacetaniiide, which 13 described by Mazundar (Indian Drugs 1989, 27, 5, 292), i.e. the compound of formula I- in which R1 = H, R2 = phenyl and R3 = K.<br>
The invention also relates to the tautomeric forms, to the enantiomers, diastereoisomers and epimers of the compounds of general formula (I) .<br>
The compounds of general formula (I) have basic nitrogen atoms and can be monosalified or disalified by mineral or organic acids.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) can.be prepared by reacting a compound of formula:<br><br>
with a compound of formula:<br><br>
in which:<br>
R5   is   selected  from  -SCH3,   pyrazolyl  or  -SO3H,<br>
and<br>
T is a tert-butyloxycarbonyl or benzyloxycarbonyl protective group.<br>
The compounds of formula (II) can be prepared in accordance with a process in which:<br>
a) a compound of formula:<br><br>
in which R2 and R3 are as defined above is reacted with an acyl halide of general formula (VI) :<br><br><br><br>
in which:<br>
A is as defined above,<br>
L represents a chlorine or bromine atom or an activated ester form,<br>
Z  represents a chlorine or bromine atom or a protected amino group, to form a compound of general formula (VII):<br><br>
in which R2, R3, A and Z are as defined above;<br>
b) the compound of general formula (VII) is reacted with potassium phthalimide and then with hydrazine monohydrate or else with a nitride followed by a reduction to form a compound of general formula (II) in which R1 = H.<br>
In the.case where Z is a protected amino group, it is appropriate to deprotect it at this stage to form a compound of general formula (II).<br>
The compounds of general formula (II) in which R1 is other than H can be obtained by reacting a compound of formula (VII) with an amine of general formula (VIII):<br>
R1NH2	(VIII).<br>
The compositions according to the present invention are useful in the treatment of pathologies associated with insulin resistance syndrome (syndrome X) .<br><br>
-    6    -<br>
Insulin resistance , is characterized by a<br>
reduction in the action of insulin (cf. Presse<br>
Medicale, 1997, 26 (No. 14), 671-677) and is involved<br>
in a large number of pathological states, such as<br>
diabetes and, more particularly, non-msulin-dependent<br>
diabetes (type II diabetes or NIDDM), dyslipidaemia,<br>
obesity,	arterial	hypertension,	and	certain<br>
microvascular   and   macrovascular    complications    such    as atherosclerosis,   retinopathies   and  neuropathies.<br>
In this context, reference may be made, for example, to Diabetes, Vol. 37, 1983, 1595-1507; Journal of Diabetes and its complications, 1998, 12, 110-119, or  Horm.   Res.,   1992,   38,   28-32.<br>
In particular, the compositions of the invention exhibit  a  strong hypogiycaemic   activity.<br>
The compositions according to the present invention can also be usec fcr treating the chronic complications due to the formation of "advanced glycosylation end products", written AGEs, which result from the glycoxidation reaction between glucose, its oxidation derivatives and the amino functions of proteins, including the so-called Maillard reactions of glycation of  glyoxal   for example.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions according to the invention can be provided in forms which are intended for parenteral, oral, rectal, pemucous or percutaneous  administration.<br>
They will therefore be provided in the form of solutions or suspensions fcr injection or multi-dose bottles, in the form of plain or coated tablets, film-coated tablets, wafer capsules, gelatin capsules, pills, cachets, powders, suppositories or rectal capsules, or solutions or suspensions for percutaneous use  in  a  polar  solvent  or  for  permucous   use.<br>
The excipients which are suitable for such administrations are derivatives of cellulose or microcrystalline cellulose, alkaline earth metal carbonates, magnesium phosphate, starches, modified. starches,   and lactose   for the  solid  forms.<br><br>

For rectal use, cocoa butter or polyethylene glycci stearates are the preferred excipients.<br>
For parenteral use, water, aqueous solutions, physiological saline and isotonic solutions are the vehicles used most judiciously.<br>
The dosage can vary within wide limits (from 0.5 mg to 1000 mg) depending on the therapeutic indication and the administration route, and also on the age and weight of the individual.<br>

STUDY OF THE ANTIPIABETIC ACTIVITY IN THE NOSTZ RAT<br>
The antidiabetic activity of the compounds of formula (I) was determined orally on an experimental model of non-insulin-dependent diabetes induced in the rat using streptozotocin.<br>
The model of non-insulin-dependent diabetes is obtained in rats by neonatal injection (on the day of birth) of streptozotocin.<br>
The diabetic rats used are 8 weeks old. The animals are kept from the day of their birth to the day of the experiment in an animal house at a regulated temperature of from 21 to 22°C and are subjectec to a fixed cycle of light (from 7.00 am to 7.00 cm) and darkness (from 7.00 pm to 7.00 am) . Their diet consisted of a maintenance diet; water and food were provided ad libitum, except for the 2 hours' fasting prior to the tests in which food is withdrawn (post-absorptive state).<br>
The rats are treated orally for one (dl) or four (d4) days with the test product. Two hours after the final administration of the product and 30 minutes after anaesthesia of the animals with sodium pentobarbital (Nembutal®) , 300 ml of blood is sampled from the end of the tail.<br>
Results obtained are collated, by way of example, in Table 5. These results demonstrate the efficacy of the compounds of formula (I) in reducing giycaemia in diabetic animals. These results are expressed as a percentage change in giycaemia on dl and d4 (number of days of treatment) relative to dO (before treatment) .<br><br>
-    23    -<br><br><br>
- 24 -STUDY OF THE ANTXGLYCOXIDATION ACTIVITY<br>
The compounds (I} are also capab le of inhibiting the so-called Maillard reactions by means of a "scavenging", effect on a-dicarbonyl derivatives such as glyoxal- - this is the antiglycation effect. This inhibitory effect on the Maillard reaction by 'the compounds of formula (I) was studied in viczo by assaying the ketamines ("fructcamines") produced during the incubation of albumin with mechylgiycxal in the presence or absence of a compound of formula (I).<br>
A 6.6 mg/ml solution of bovine albumin in 0.2 M phosphate buffer pH 7.4 is incubated with 1 mM methyiglyoxal in the presence or absence of a compound according to the invention at a concentration of 1 mM. The incubation is carried out under sterile conditions at 37°C for 6 days. At the end of the incubation period, the amount of ketamines is measured with a commercially available  fructoamine assay kit (kit "ERA", product reference: 0757055, Roche S.A. products) in " accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Under these experimental conditions, the level of fructoamine ' following incubation of albumin with methyiglyoxal in the presence of a compound of formula (I) "is from 30 to 50% lower than that observed when albumin is incubated.with methyiglyoxal in the absence of 'the compound, of formula (I) .<br><br>
