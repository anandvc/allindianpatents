				<td> Methods and Kits for Stabilising. Protecting and Solubilising Proteins<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to methods, kits and reagents for stabilising protein conformation, protecting proteins from aggregation and/or degradation, and/or for improving protein solubility.<br>
Background to the Invention<br>
The biological function of a protein is dependent on its three dimensional structure. Proteins are formed as linear chains of amino acids, termed polypeptides. In vivo, in the appropriate conditions within the cell, the linear polypeptide chain is folded, a process which may be assisted by proteins called chaperones. A mature folded protein has an active three dimensional conformation, known as the native structure. The structure depends on weak forces such as hydrogen bonding, electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions. These forces are affected by the protein environment, so changes in the environment may cause structural disruption resulting in denaturation and/or degradation of the protein and loss of function. Such problems are encountered during processing of proteins and on storage of proteins.<br>
The production of proteins by genetic engineering often results in the accumulation of non-active protein aggregates as inclusion bodies. After isolation and purification from the host cells, proteins or inclusion bodies have to be unfolded (denatured) and subsequently refolded (renatured) so that the proteins regain their native structure and bioactivity.<br><br>
Traditional protein folding methods involve denaturant dilution or column-based approaches. Denatured protein is commonly refolded by diluting the denaturant This induces a hydrophobic collapse of the protein molecule and in doing so the protein shields its hydrophobic patches in the core of the molecule, Unfortunately, on hydrophobic collapse, proteins do not always form the native bioactive conformation; two competing reactions occur; refolding and aggregation, it is suggested that a driver for protein aggregation is hydrophobic amino acid residues exposed at the surface. Aggregation is undesirable and reduces the yield of functional, native protein. Refolding is known as a first order reaction {Rate = K * [prot])) but the aggregation reaction is favoured over refolding at high concentration as it is a higher order reaction (n) (Rate = K' * [prot]1*). The proportion of protein refolding:protein aggregation is strongly dependant on the protein concentration. At process scale this concentration dependency can result in increased aggregation, and thus reduced refolding yield. This can be due to imperfect mixing patterns in the protein solution. Processing large protein molecules is particularly difficult as they diffuse more slowly than the smaller denaturant molecules, thus creating micro-environments containing high localised protein concentrations and low denaturant concentration, that is, an environment that favours protein aggregation over protein refolding.<br>
For proteins with disulphide bonds the native protein often needs to be "matured"; during maturation, non-aggregated monomeric protein molecules with non-native disulphide bonds may be created initially; then, using a protein specific nedox couple, the disulphide bonds shuffle and the protein matures to a functional protein molecule with native disulphide bonds.<br>
Refolding processes usually involve dispersing the denatured protein molecules in a buffer in the presence of "refolding aids" to enhance renaturation. Folding aids usually increase the solubility of the folding intermediates and/or change the relative reaction rates of the folding and aggregation reactions. Polyethylene glyco! and various sugars, e.g. sucrose, glucose, N-acetylglucosamine, and detergents, e.g. Chaps, Tween,  SDS,<br><br>
Dodecylmalioside have been employed as refolding aids {De Bernadez Clark (1998) Current Opinion Biotechnot, 9, 157-163).<br>
α ,β  and  γ cyciodextrins (CDs) have been reported to be useful in stabilisation, solubfiisation and affinity purification of certain enzymes, but both the nature of the interactions between these CDs and proteins, and their effect on bioactivity remain unclear, α ,β  and  γ-cyclodextrins have been used as artificial chaperones to aid protein refolding in both detergent-free (Sharma et al, EP 0 871 651, US 5,728,804) and detergent-containing refolding environments (Gellman &amp; Rozerna, US 5,563,057). Cyciodextrins are cyclic otigosaccharides composed of multiple giucose residues. They are classified according to the number of sugar residues within the ring structure, α ,-cyclodextrin has 6 glucose residues, β  -cyclodextrin has 7 glucose residues and  γ-cycbdextrin has 8 glucose residues. Cyciodextrins can be modified by derivatisation to produce derivatives.<br>
The inner cavity of cyciodextrins is hydrophobic whereas the outer surface is hydrophitic. The hydrophobic interior is capable of encapsulating poorly soluble drugs. The hydrophitic exterior assists in solubilisation, so cyciodextrins are useful adjuncts in pharmaceutical formulation,<br>
EP 0 094 157 &amp; US 4,659,696 (Hirai er a/) describe the use of α ,β  and  γ cyclodextrin derivatives in pharmaceutical compositions consisting essentially of a physical mixture of a hydrophilic, physiologically active (folded, native) peptide and a cyclodextrin derivative, the composition being a uniform mixture in dosage form.<br>
EP 0 437 678 B1, US 5,730,969 and US 5,997,856 (Hora) describe methods for the solubilisation and/or stabilisation of polypeptides, especially proteins, using specified cyclodextrin derivatives: hydroxypropyl, hydroxyethyl, glucosyl, maltosyl, and maltotriosyl derivatives of β  and  γ-cyciodextrin; the hydroxypropy}-j3-cyclodextrin derivative being preferred.  Also disclosed are<br><br>
aqueous and lyophilised compositions comprising a polypeptide, optionally a protein, and the above specified cyclodextrin derivatives.<br>
EP 0 871 651 &amp; US 5,728,804 (Sharma et al) are concerned with a method for ranaturing an unfolded or aggregated protein in a detergent-free aqueous medium with an amount of a cyclodextrin effective to renature said unfolded or aggregated protein, In this instance, the protein is present at a low concentration selected to minimise aggregation, preferably at around 0.05 mg/ml, and spontaneously refolds in a refolding buffer containing cyclodextrin. After refolding the cyclodextrin is removed by dialysis.<br>
US 5,563,057 (Geliman &amp; Rozema) describes a method for refolding an enzyme from a misfolded configuration to a second native active configuration by adding a detergent having a linear alkyl non-polar portion, e.g. CTA8 and Triton^-X 100 (Octoxynol-9), to misfolded enzyme to form an enzyrne-detergent complex, which is then contacted with a cyclodextrin to allow the enzyme to assume a second active conformation.<br>
Hinrichs et al (2001). International Journal of Pharmaceutics, 215, 163-174, describes the use of non-derivatised inulins, inuiin SC 95 (DPn/DPw = 5.5/8.0), inulin RS (DPn/DPw - 14.2/19.4), and inulin EXL 608 (DPn/DPw 23.0/26.2) to protect alkaline phosphatase from degradation during freeze drying and subsequent storage of the dried protein.<br>
WO 96/41870 (Gombac et al) describe frozen, dried or lyophilized hydrosoluble collagenase compositions containing isomait and/or inuiin (non-derivatised) to stabilise the coilagenase.<br>
Inuiins are D-fructans, generally consisting of chains of polyfructose in which the fructose units are connected to each other mostly or exclusively by beta (2-1) linkages. Inuiin occurs in nature, in general, as a polydisperse mixture of polyfructose chains most of which are ending in one glucosy! unit. Inuiin can be obtained from bacteria! syntheses, extracted from plants or can be made in vitro<br><br>
by enzymatic synthesis starting from sucrose. Inulin produced by bacteria is more branched than inulin from plant origin and commonly has a higher molecular weight (ranging from about 2,000 up to about 20,000,000), whereas inulin from plant origin is generally composed of linear or slightly branched polyfructose chains, or mixtures thereof, with a molecular weight commonly ranging from about 600 to about 20,000.<br>
Inulin can be represented, depending from the terminal carbohydrate unit, by the general formulae GF.n or F.n, wherein G represents a glucosyl unit, F a fructosyl unit, and n is an integer representing the number of fructosyl units linked to each other in the carbohydrate chain. The number of saccharide units (fructose and glucose units) in one inufin molecule, i.e. the value of n in the formulae above, is referred to as the degree of polymerisation, represented by (DP). Often, the parameter (number) average degree of polymerisation, represented by (DP), is used too, which is the value corresponding to the total number of saccharide units (G and F units) in a given inulin composition divided by the total number of inulin molecules present in said inulin composition, without taking into account the possibly present monosaccharicies glucose (G) and fructose (F), and the dlsaccharide sucrose (GF). The average degree of polymerisation (DP) can be determined, for example, by the method described by L De Leenheer (Starch, 46 (5), 193-196, (1994), and Carbohydrates as Organic Raw Materials, Vol. ill, p. 67-92, (1996)).<br>
Inulin is commonly prepared from plant sources, mainly from roots of Chicory (Glchorium intybus) and from tubers of Jerusalem artichoke (Helfanthus tuberosus), in which inulin can be present in concentrations of about 10 to 20% w/w on fresh plant material. Inulin from plant origin is usually a polydisperse mixture of linear and slightly branched poiysaccharide chains with a degree of • polymerisation (DP) ranging from 2 to about 100, In accordance with known techniques, inulin can be readily extracted from said plant parts, purified and optionally fractionated to remove impurities, mono- and disaccharides and undesired oligosaccharides, in order to provide various grades of inuiin, e.g. as described in EP 0 769 026 and EP 0 670 850.<br><br>
Inulin is commercially available, typically with a (DP) ranging from about 6 to about 40. Inulin from chicory is for example available as RAFTIUNE® from Orafti (Tienen, Belgium) in various grades. Typical RAFTILlNE® grades include RAFTILINE® ST {with a (DP) of about 10 and containing in total up to about 8% by weight glucose, fructose and sucrose), RAFTiLlNE® LS (with a (DP) of about 10 but containing in total less than 1% by weight glucose, fructose and sucrose), and RAFTIUNE®. RTM. HP (with a (DP) of at least 23, commonly with a (DP) of about 25, and virtually free of glucose, fructose and sucrose). lnutec®N25, a non-derivatised inulin with a DP of 25, is available from Orafti,<br>
Inulins with a lower degree of polymerisation, usually defined as a (DP) 
Various inulin derivatives and methods for the preparation of inulin derivatives are described in US 6,534,647 (Stevens et al), the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Inulins derivatised with hydrophobic alky! chains on the poiyfructose backbone are commercially available, for example Inutec^SPI (SP1) from Orafti (Tienen, Belgium).<br>
Starch is a well-known carbohydrate that is abundantly present in many plants as a biodegradable reserve polysaccharide. Starch molecules are polymers composed of D-glucosyl units which are linked to one another by α -1,4 glucosyl-<br><br>
glucosyl bonds, thus forming a linear chain starch structure (termed amylose) or by αct-1,4 and α-1,6 glucosy! bonds thus forming a branched chain starch structure (termed amyiopectin) having a α-1,6 glucosyl-giucosyl bond at the branching point. Starch occurs in nature as a pofydisperse mixture of polymeric molecules which have, depending on the plant source, mainiy a linear structure or mainly a branched structure. Starch can also occur in nature as a polydieperse mixture of molecules with said structures. The degree of polymerisation (DP), i. e. the number of glucosy! units linked to one another in a starch molecule, may widely vary and it largely depends on the plant source and the harvesting time.<br>
The linkages between the glucosyl units are sensitive to hydrolysis, heat and shearing forces. This phenomenon is industrially exploited to prepare various starch derivatives, generically termed herein starch hydrolysates, through acidic hydrolysis, enzymatic hydrolysis, thermal treatment or shearing, or through combinations of said treatments. Depending on the source of the starch, the hydrolysis catalyst, the hydrolysis conditions, the thermal treatment and/or the shearing conditions, a wide variety of starch hydrolysates can be obtained, ranging from a product essentially composed of glucose, over products commonly termed glucose syrups, to products commonly termed maltodextrins and dextrins. Starch hydrolysates are well known in the art.<br>
D-glucose (dextrose) presents strong reducing power. Starch hydrolysates are polydisperse mixtures, composed of D-g!ucose, alfgomeric (DP  10) molecules composed of D-giucosyl chains, which also present reducing power resulting from the presence of D-glucose and reducing sugar units (which are essentially terminal glucosyi units) on the oligomeric and polymeric molecules.<br>
As a result, starting from a given starch product, the greater the extent of the hydrolysis, the more molecules (monomeric D-glucose, oiigomeric and remaining polymeric molecules) will be present in the hydrolysate, and thus the higher the reducing powder of the starch hydrolysate obtained. Accordingly, the<br><br>
reducing power of starch hydrolysates has become the distinguishing feature of choice to differentiate and designate the various starch hydrolysate products. The reducing power is expressed as dextrose equivalents (D. E.) which formally corresponds to the grams of D-g!ucose (dextrose) per 100 grams of dry substance. D-glucose having per definition a D. E. of 100, the D. E. indicates the amount of D-glucose and reducing sugar units (expressed as dextrose) in a given product on a dry product basis. Thus the D. E. is in fact also a measurement of the extent of hydrolysis of the starch and also a relative indication of the average molecular weight of the glucose polymers in the starch hydrolysate.<br>
The D. E. of starch hydrolysates, apart from hydrolysates composed essentially of D-glucosef may range from 1 to about 96 and starch hydrolysates are commercially available in a wide variety of grades based on the D. E.<br>
Hydrolysates with a D. E. greater than 20 are commonly termed glucose syrups. Glucose syrups with a D. E. up to 47 can be dried by conventional techniques, for example by spray drying, to yield so-called "dried glucose syrups" in powder form, containing a maximum of about 5 wt% humidity.<br>
Hydrolysates with a D. E. of 20 or less are commonly termed maitodextrins and dextrins. The manufacturing process usually involves a spray drying step at the end, yielding these hydrolysate products in powder form also containing a maximum of about 5 wt% humidity (wt% indicates % by weight).<br>
Glucose syrups, maitodextrins and dextrins are made industrially at large scale from various starch sources under controiled hydrolysis conditions according to well-known methods. The various grades of starch hydrolysates obtained are usually defined by their starch source material and by their D. E. value, often in combination with an indication of the method of manufacture (e.g. maltodextrins/dextrins).<br><br>
Although following certain Regulations the term "maltodextrins" is reserved to designate products derived from corn starch, the term maltodextrin (s) used herein is not limited to hydrolysates of corn starch, but indicates herein starch hydrolysates with a D. E, of 20 or less obtained from starch from any source.<br>
Typical commercial sources of starch are corn, potato, tapioca, rice, sorgum and wheat However, the starch hydrolysates suitable for use in connection with the present invention are not limited to starch from said sources, they extend to starch hydrolysates obtained from starch from any source.<br>
Glucose syrups, maltodextrins and dextrins are well known and commercially available. For example, the production, properties and applications of glucose syrups and maltodextrins have been described in review articles in the book Starch Hydrolysis Products, Worldwide Technology, Production and Applications, Weinheirn VCH Publishers inc. (1992), Furthermore, in the technical brochure "GLUCIDEX Brochure 8/ 09.98" from the company Roquette, describes maltodextrins and drted glucose syrups are described and various grades are offered for sale/<br>
Controlling the stability of proteins during processing and on storage is recognised as a problem in many industries, in particular the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. Difficulties encountered with proteins may make manufacture of proteins difficult result in low yields and render processes uneconomic Proteins are exposed to conditions during processing that may result in degradation of the protein and loss of function, thus there is a need to improve methods of protein processing to protect the protein and minimise damage or loss of protein. Additionally there is a need to improve protein solubility and reduce protein aggregation. There is also a desire to improve methods that involve processing of proteins in solution, so that processing can be performed at higher protein concentration, thereby reducing volumes. Unfortunately, aggregation is generally promoted at high protein concentration and regions of high local protein concentration are hard to eliminate in large reaction vessels. Detergents or chaotropes can be used to maintain protein<br><br>
solubility, but detergents are extremely difficult to remove during downstream processing, and there are additional drawbacks with the chemicals used, for example the denaturant guanidine hydrochloride is toxic and corrodes the stainless steel vessels and pipes of protein production equipment Long exposure of a protein to the denaturant urea may result in modification of amino acids, e.g. carbamylation. Detergents and solubilising agents such as arginine are incompatible with several of the most common analytical techniques used in protein laboratories (e.g. Bradford Assay, SDS-PAGE gels, RP-HPLC). Buffer exchange to remove such contaminants is possible, but results in an unknown dilution or loss of the sample and may cause protein aggregation.<br>
Problems addressed by the present invention include stabiiisafion of proteins against conformationat change (e.g. maintaining protein in a denatured conformation, or native conformation), thereby reducing aggregation of proteins, improving protein solubility and protecting proteins against degradation. The present invention also seeks to improve solubility of proteins so that they are maintained in solution, in a denatured or native non-aggregated form, with reduced adherence to the vessel or other protein molecules, and reduced propensity to aggregate.<br>
ft is an object of the present invention to provide methods for stabilisation, protection and solubilisation of proteins, that can be used in methods of protein processing, in particular in methods involving protein folding, purification, concentration and/or storage such that the disadvantages associated with present methods are alleviated.<br>

Amphipathic sugar polymers are capable of hydrophobic interaction with native and/or denatured protein. Derivatisation of the sugar polymer with appropriate substituents enhances the amphipathic nature and strength of interaction with the protein. Suitable substituents for sugar polymer derivatives used in the methods, uses and kits of the invention include substituents selected from the group consisting of alkyl groups having from 1 to 25 carbon atoms, atkenyt and aikynyl groups having from 2 to 25 carbon atoms, hatoaikyl groups having from 1 to 25 carbon atoms, cycloalkyl groups having from 3 to 9 carbon atoms, aryl<br><br>

It is preferred that inulin derivatives or glucoside hydrocarby! derivatives are derlvatised by one or more type(s) of non-polar hydrocarbyl group, e.g. those selected from the group consisting of: alky! groups having from 1 to 25 carbon atoms, alkenyl and alkynyl groups having from 2 to 25 carbon atoms, haloalkyi groups having from 1 to 25 carbon atoms, cycloalkyl groups having from 3 to 9 carbon atoms, aryl groups having from 6 to 14 carbon atoms, aralkyl groups comprising alky! groups having from 1 to 25 carbon atoms which are substituted with 1 or more aryi groups having from 6 to 14 carbon atoms, fatty acid groups having from 2 to 25 carbon atoms and polyols having from 1 to 25 carbon atoms.

In a preferred aspect, the invention provides a method of stabilizing a protein characterised by contacting the protein with an inulin derivative. Preferably, the protein and inulin derivative are contacted in aqueous solution. Methods of stabilisation of protein in aqueous solution may further comprise desiccation, dehydration, evaporation or lyophilisation (freeze drying) of the aqueous solution to produce a dried protein/inulin derivative composition. Drying is particularly useful to help maintain the protein conformation, integrity (and, if native, function), if the protein is to be stored for a length of time. In such methods the protein is stabilised by the inulin derivative against conformational change. The protein to be stabilised can be in the form of a denatured protein, or in native conformation. Denatured proteins are stabilised against aggregation, native proteins are stabilised against denaturation. Both denatured and native protein are protected against degradation.<br>
In a further preferred aspect, the invention provides a method of solubilising a protein, characterised by contacting the protein with an inulin derivative. Also provided is a method for stabilising protein in non-native configuration comprising providing to an aqueous solution of protein in non-native conformation, an inulin derivative at a concentration sufficient to inhibit protein folding. The invention further provides a method for stabilising protein in native conformation comprising providing to an aqueous solution of protein in native conformation an inulin derivative at a concentration sufficient to maintain the protein in native conformation.<br>
A concentration of sugar polymer derivative, e.g. inulin derivative, sufficient to inhibit protein folding is a concentration at which renaturation of denatured protein is retarded. At appropriate concentrations, there is less return of structure than would occur if the sugar polymer derivative were not present, because the sugar polymer derivative helps to maintain the protein in non-native configuration. The presence of the sugar polymer derivative reduces the<br><br>
rate of refolding compared to that which would be observed if the derivative was not present. The concentration of inuiin derivative for stabilising a given protein in a given conformation (denatured or native) wili depend on various factors such as the temperature,, solution conditions protein concentration and the protein itself. Suitable concentrations can be determined readily by the skilled person.<br>
The concentration of the inulin derivative for stabilising protein will generally fall within the range of from about 0,1 to about 1000 times the molar concentration of protein, preferably about 0.5 to about 500, about 1 to about 300, about 1 to about 100, about 1 to about 50, about 1 to about 30, about 1 to about 25, or about 1 to about 20 times the molar concentration of protein. Typically, the inulin derivative(s) is present in solution at a concentration of from about 0.002 mg/ml to about 100 mg/ml, preferably about 0.01 mg/ml to about 50 mg/ml, about 0.02 mg/ml to about 10 mg/ml or about 0.25 to 2.5 mg/ml. The upper limit for concentration of an inulin derivative in aqueous solution is governed by the solubility of that inulin derivative in the solution.<br>
Methods of the invention in which an inulin derivative is employed to stabilise and protect protein are useful in -methods of protein processing, e.g. in protein folding methods and/or processing involving one or more protein purification step{s)J such as dialysis, diafiltration, uitrafiltration and chromatography.<br>

glucoside hydrocarbyl derivatives of formula (lla) composed of units of formula<br>
Oil):<br>
G' (O-CO-NH-R1)b (III)<br>
Wherein<br>
G' represents a giucosyi unit of a starch hydrolysate molecule, the starch<br>
hydrolysate having a Dextrose Equivalent (D. E.) ranging from 1 to 47,<br>
R1 is a hydrocarbyl group as defined above, and<br>
b represents the number of hydrocarbyl carbamate groups per glucosyl unit,<br>
which number is commonly expressed as the degree of substitution (DS), i.e.<br>
the average number of hydrocarbyl substituents per glucosyl unit of the<br>
glucoside hydrocarbyl urethane of formula (IIa), with said DS value ranging from<br>
0.01 to 2.0.<br>
The number of hydroxyl groups per glucosyl unit of the subject glucoside molecules which theoretically can be substituted by a carbamate group is, for a non-terminal, non-branched glucosyl unit, a maximum of 3, whereas the number for a terminal or for a non-terminal branched glucosyl unit Is, respectively, 4 or 2. Furthermore, since the DS represents an average number of substitusnts per glucosyl unit, it is evident that in a glucoside N-hydrocarbyl carbamate (lla) molecule there may be glucosyl units present which are not substituted by a hydrocarbyl carbamate group (thus b in formula (Hi) being zero for said glucosyl unit).<br>
Starch hydrolysates commonly appear in the form of a polydisperse mixture of glucoside molecuies. Accordingly, when such a mixture is used, as is usually the case, as starting material for the preparation of a glucoside hydrocarbyl urethane (IIa), the product obtained is also a corresponding polydisperse mixture of glucoside hydrocarbyl urethanes (lla). Such polydisperse mixtures<br><br>
constitute a preferred embodiment of the glucoside hydrocarbyl urethanes (ila) for utilisation in the methods and uses of the present invention.<br>
Commercial grades of starch hydrolysates, composed of said polydisperse mixture of glucoside molecules and having a D. E. ranging from 1 to 47 are very suitable for the preparation of glucoside hydrocarbyi urethanes (Ha),<br>
Typically suitable starch hydrolysates for use in the preparation of glucoside N-hydrocarbyl urethanes (IIa) of the invention are for example GLUCIDEX® maltodextrins and GLUCIDEX® dried glucose syrups which are available from ROQUETTE company, such as the maltodextrins of type 1 (potato based with D. E. max 5), type 2 (Waxy Maize based with D. E. max 5), type 6 (Waxy Maize based with D. E. 5 to 8), type 9 (Potato based with D. E. 8 to 10), and maJtodextrins of type 12 (D. E. 11 to 14), type 17 (D. E. 15 to 18) and type 19 (D. E. 13 to 20), as well as dried glucose syrups of type 21 (D. E. 20 to 23), type 28E (D, E. 28 to 31), type 29 (D. E. 28 to 31), type 32 (D. E. 31 to 34), type 33 (D. E. 31 to 34), type 38 (D. E. 36 to 40), type 39 (D. E. 38 to 41), type 40 (D. E. 38 to 42) and type 47 (D. E. 43 to 47).<br>

In another preferred embodiment, the hydrocarbyl group is a C3-C22 alkenyl group, preferably a C4-C15 alkeny! group, most preferably a linear C8-C18 alkenyl group.<br>
Typically suitable alkenyl groups include butenyl, hexanyl, octenyl, decenyl, dodecenyl, tetradecenyl, hexadecenyl and octadecenyl groups.<br><br>
In the urethane (lla) of the invention, all R1 groups of the units of formula (III) may be the same or different The latter urethanes (lla) can be easily prepared, according to the method described below, by reacting a starch hydrolysate with an isocyanate of formula R1-NCO which is in fact a mixture of two or more isocyanates bearing different R1 groups defined above.<br>
Saturated alkyl isocyanates can be prepared conventionally, e.g. by reacting a primary or secondary alkyl-amine with phosgene, Unsaturated alkylisocyanates can be prepared similarly from alkenyl-amines. α,β -unsaturated alkylisocyanates of formula R2R3C=CH-NCO (IV) wherein the radical R2R3C=CH- corresponds to the group R1 of formula (III) and wherein R2 represents hydrogen or an alkyl group and R3 represents an alkyi or vinyl group, can be prepared by condensation of the aldehyde R2R3CH-CHO with Me3C-NH2, followed by reaction of the resultant Schiff base (in equilibrium with its enamine form) with phosgene, and thermal elimination of MesC-CI as disclosed by K. Koenig et a/. (Angew. Chem., 21 (4), 334-335 (1979)). Furthermore, various unsaturated alkylisocyanates are disclosed, inter alia in US 3, 890, 383 and US 3, 803, 062 of Dow Chemical Co. Many alkyl cyanates of formula R1-N=C=0 (R1 as defined above) are commercially available.<br>
Glucoside hydrocarbyl urethanes (lla) in accordance with the present invention have a degree of substitution (DS) per glucosyl unit of formula (III) ranging from 0.01 to 2.0, preferably from 0.02 to 1.0, and most preferably from 0.03 to 0.3.<br>
The hydrocarbyl carbamate substituent or substituents can be located at various positions on the giucosyl units of the glucoside hydrocarbyl urethanes (ila).<br>
The glucoside hydrocarbyl urethanes (ila) of the present invention can be prepared in analogy with conventional methods for the preparation of urethanes of monosaccharides, disaccharides, and pojysaocharides, for example, by reacting the starch hydrolysate with the selected hydrocarbyl isocyanate or<br><br>
mixture of hydrocarbyl isocyanates, in solution in a solvent which is inert with respect to the starch hydroiysate, the isocyanate and the reaction product.<br>
Suitable solvents include solvents or solvent mixtures which are free of reactive hydroxyl and amine groups, such as for example dimethyl formamide (DMF), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and N-methyl pyrrolidone (NMP).<br>
The reaction between the starch hydroiysate and the hydrocarbylisocyanate is preferably performed under anhydrous conditions. In view of this, the starch hydroiysate as well as the solvent(s) are dried, preferably to a water content of less than 0.5 wt%, prior to bringing them into contact with the hydrocarbyi isocyanate. Drying can be carried out by conventional techniques, including, for example by heating the starch hydroiysate in a stream of dry air, or by heating the starch hydroiysate under reduced pressure, or by removing the water through azeotropic distillation, optionally under reduced pressure, from a solution of the starch hydroiysate In the solvent chosen for the reaction. During drying a maximum temperature, depending on the nature of the starch hydrotysate and the solvent, should not be exceeded in order to avoid any decomposition or side reaction. Preferably said temperature should be kept below about 80'C.<br>
The reaction is typically carried out by bringing the starch hydroiysate dissolved in a suitable solvent into contact, under gentle to vigorous stirring, with the hydrocarbyi isocyanate In neat form or dissolved in an anhydrous solvent The reaction can be carried out over a wide temperature range, typically from room temperature up to about 80oC, or the reflux temperature of the reaction mixture if it is lower, preferably at a temperature between about 60oC and about 80oC.<br>
Typically, the starch hydroiysate is dissolved in a suitable solvent, where necessary under heating. Accordingly, the hydrocarbyi isocyanate (optionally dissolved in the same or in another inert solvent, but which is preferably miscible with the former solvent) is added slowly under stirring to the dissolved glucoside. The desired degree of substitution of the glucoside hydrocarbyi<br><br>
urethane (lla) can be obtained by controlling the ratio of the reactants. Since the reaction of an hydrocarbyl isocyanate with an alcoholic hydroxyl group to form an urethane is a quantitative reaction, the degree of substitution of the urethane (Ha) can be controlled by the selection of the proper molar ratio of the hydrocarbyl isocyanate per glucosyl unit of the starch hydrolysate, Usually the reaction mixture is heated with stirring for a time period, usually from about 30 minutes to about 24 hours, in order to complete the reaction between the reagents. The reaction mixture is then worked up by conventional techniques, for example, by precipitating the formed urethane (lla) through pouring the reaction mixture, usually after cooling to room temperature, in a precipitant solvent, which is a solvent that is miscible with the solvent or solvents used to dissolve the reagents but in which the glucoside alkyl urethane (lla) is not or very poorly soluble. The urethane (lla) is then physically isolated from the reaction mixture, for example by filtration or centrifugation, washed with a suitable solvent in which the urethane (lla) is not or only very slightly soluble, and dried using any common technique.<br>
A further convenient method to synthesise a desired urethane (lla) according to the present invention, can be performed in an analogous manner to the one described by W. Gerhardt, Abh. Dtsch. Akad. Wiss. Berlin, KL Chem, Geol. Bioi., Vol 1966 (6), 24-36, (1967) (C. A..6S, 14323). It involves the transformation in a one-pot reaction in dimethyl formamide of the starch hydrolysate with potassium cyanate and with a selected hydrocarbyl halogenide, preferably an hydrocarbyl bromide.<br>

of the sugar polymer derivative is not desired 5n the protein product, then the sugar polymer derivative can be readily separated from protein,<br>
Methods and uses of the invention are useful as the sugar polymer derivatives employed influence protein analytical techniques to a much lesser extent than traditional denaturants, solubilisers and protectants e.g. detergents, arginine and guanidine hydrochloride.<br>
Sugar polymer derivatives are generally less expensive than chaperone proteins, so the invention provides a cost effective means of maintaining or improving solubility, particularly in scale-up of processes, where prior art methods may prove uneconomic.<br>
 In methods of the invention, aggregation is suppressed without compromising downstream applications of the protern.<br>
Methods of the invention are suitable to enhance protein stability on storage, improve chromatographic purifications, minimise losses during protein concentration and reduce protein aggregation during dialysis.
