CDMA SIGNAL POWER CONTROL USING QUADRATURE SIGNAL CALCULATIONS<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
I.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) systems. More particularly, the present invention includes, but is not limited to, a novel and improved CDMA base station that controls transmit power based on quadrature signal calculations.<br>
II.	Description of the Related Art<br>
Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) technology is commonly used in communications systems. In a typical CDMA system, a CDMA base station transmits a CDMA signal to numerous CDMA communications devices, such as wireless telephones. The CDMA signal is comprised of numerous individual user signals. The CDMA base station generates the CDMA signal by encoding each individual user signal with a unique spreading sequence, such as a pseudo random sequence. The CDMA base station then adds the encoded user signals together to form the CDMA signal.<br>
In a CDMA system, individual user signals are not separated based on frequency or time, but are spread across the entire frequency band. Each CDMA communications device derives its particular user signal based on the uruque spreading sequence. Due to this combination of multiple signals encoded with random sequences, the CDMA signal has special power concerns because each signal represents noise to the other signals that share the frequency band. Thus, CDMA transmission systems must carefully track the power of each signal.<br>
Baseband CDMA signals are typically generated in a well-known quadrature format comprised of quadrature CDMA. signals I and Q. Quadrature CDMA signals I and Q are transmitted using carriers of the same frequency, but in phase quadrature. In other words, an RF CDMA signal can be constructed by modulating I by cosine (2 x pi x frequency x time) and by modulating Q by sine (2 x pi x frequency x time). In IS-95A, quadrature signals carry the same data with different pseudo-random sequence codes.<br>
FIG. 1 depicts a multi-sector base station 100 that is currently known in the art. The base station 100 is divided into geographic sectors with callers A-F<br><br>
in sector 1 and callers G-L m sector 2. for the sake of illustration, caller F will move from sector 1 to sector 2 as indicated by the dashed lines, but the operation of the base station 100 is first discussed prior to the caller F move from sector 1 to sector 2. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the diagram of the base station 100 has been simplified for clarity,<br>
The sector 1 portion of the base station 100 includes cell site modems 102 and 104, gain control 106, summing circuit 108, CDMA signal processor 110 including gain 112, and antenna 114. The sector 2 portion of the base station 100 includes cell site modems 122 and 124, gain control 126, summing circuit 128, CDMA signal processor 130 including gain 132, and antenna 134.<br>
In operation, the cell site modem 102 receives signals for callers A, B, C and applies conventional CDMA processing to generate CDMA quadrature signals I and Q. The cell site modem 102 provides the CDMA quadrature signals 1 and Q to the summing circuit 108, The cell site modem 104 receives signals for callers D, E, F and applies conventional CDMA processing to generate CDMA quadrature signals I and Q, The cell site modem 104 provides the CDMA quadrature signals I and Q to the summing circuit 108. The summing circuit separately combines the I signals and the Q signals and transfers them to the CDMA signal processor 110. The CDMA signal processor 110 performs analog conversion, filtering, up-conversion, and amplification to provide a Radio Frequency (RF) CDMA signal to the antenna 114, The antenna 114 transmits the RF CDMA signal 116 over the air to the callers A-F in sector L<br>
The cell site modem 122 receives signals for callers G, H, I and applies conventional CDMA processing to generate CDMA quadrature signals I and Q, The cell site modem 122 provides the CDMA quadrature signals I and Q to the summing circuit 12S, The cell site modem 124 receives signals for callers L K, L and applies conventional CDMA processing to generate CDMA quadrature signals I and Q. The cell site modem 124 provides the CDMA quadrature signals 1 and Q to the summing circuit 128. The summing circuit separately combines the I signals and the Q signals and transfers them to the CDMA signal processor 130. The CDMA signal processor 130 performs analog conversion, filtering, up-conversion, and amplification to provide an RF CDMA signal to the antenna 134. The antenna 134 transmits the RF' CDMA signal 136 over the air to the callers G-L in sector 2.<br>
Each cell cite modem 102, 104, 122, and 124 provides gain information 118 to both the gam control 106 and the gain control 126. The gain information 118 includes the squared gain for each call, pilot signal, and overhead. Gain control 106 and gain control 126 each maintain a database that incorporates the gain information 118.<br><br>
The CDMA signal processor 110 monitors the transmit power (Pout) of the CDMA signal 116 for sector 1 and provides a Pout value 119 for sector 1 to the gain control'106. The gam control 106 compares the Pout value 119 for the CDMA signal 116 to a Gain Value (GV) equal to the sum of the squared gains for the CDMA signal 116. The squared gains for the CDMA signal 116 are obtained from the gam information 118. The gain control 106 transfers a control signal 117 to the gain 112 to adjust the Pout to maintain a ratio of CA' to Pout at a pre-determined value. FIG. 2 shows the desired relationship between Pout and the GV. The points X and Y represent operational measurements, and the arrows represent the control applied through the control signal 117 to the gain 112 to maintain the pre-determined value. Those skilled in the art are aware that the slope of the pre-determined value blossoms during start-up and wilts during shut-down.<br>
The CDMA signal processor 130 monitors the Pout for sector 2 and provides the Pout value 139 for sector 2 to the gain control 126. The gain control 126 compares the Pout value 139 for the CDMA signal 136 to a GV equal to the sum of the squared gains for the CDMA signal 136. The squared gains for the CDMA signal 136 are obtained from the gain information 118. The gain control 126 transfers a control signal 137 to the gain 132 to adjust Pout to maintain a ratio of GV to Pout at a pre-determined value.<br>
When caller F moves from sector 1 to sector 2, the cell site modem 104 for sector 1 transfers the caller F quadrature signals 141 and 142 to the summing circuit 128 for sector 2. Thus, the CDMA signal 136 now includes the caller F signal. As a result, the gain control 126 must now add the square of the caller F gain to its GV.<br>
It should be appreciated that each cell site modem must transfer all gain information 118 to the gain control in each sector. This requires a data transfer arrangement across all sectors, and much of the transferred data is unnecessary. For example, gain control 126 does not need the gain for caller A unless caller A moves into sector 2. The gain control for each sector must also track the calls in its sector and perform repeated calculations based on a changing database. Tne current power calculation technique for CDIVLA base stations should be improved to reduce data transfer and storage.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The above-described problem is solved with CDMA quadrature signal technology that controls the transmit power of a CDMA signal. The CDMA quadrature signal technology eliminates unnecessary data transfer and storage because gain control is accomplished without transferring or using per call gain information. The CDMA quadrature signal technology receives a CDMA signal, and in response, processes quadrature components of the CDMA signal to generate a power control signal. The CDMA quadrature signal technology adjusts the gain of the CDMA signal in response to the power control signal. A CDMA transmitter transmits the CDMA signal after the gain is adjusted. One example ot the CDMA transmitter is a CDMA base station. Using the invention, a multi-sector CDMA base station can control power' without transferring gain information to base station components for all sectors.<br>
In some examples of the invention, a multi-sector base station squares and sums the quadrature I and Q signals in a CDMA signal for a given sector. A ratio is then formed by comparing the sum to the transmit power of the CDMA signal. The transmit power of the CDMA signal is controlled to move the ratio closer to a pre-determined value that optimizes base station performance.<br>

The CDMA communications svstem 406 is comprised of a switching center 410 and a base station 412. The communications system 404 exchanges communications signals 405 with the switching center 410. The switching center 410 exchanges communications signals 411 with the base station 412. The base station 412 exchanges wireless CDMA communications signals 407 over the air interface with the CDMA communications devices 408. Although the invention is depicted using an air<br><br>
interface, other transmission media could also be used, such as RF cable, power lines, or telephone lines.<br>
The communications system 404 could be any communications system capable or exchanging communications signals 405 with tne CDMA communications system 406. The communications system 404 is typically a conventional public telephone network, but could also be many other networks, such as a local area network, wide area network, or internet.<br>
The switching center 410 could be any device that provides an interlace between the base station 412 and the communications system 404. Typically, numerous base stations are connected to the communications system 404 through the switching center 410, but the number of base stations has been restricted for the purpose of clarity.<br>

FIG. 5 depicts the base station 412 of FIG. 4 receiving the communications signals 411 and transmitting the CDMA communications signals 407. The base station could be a multi-sector base station with the circuitry of FIG. 5 replicated for each sector. Advantageously, there is no need for an arrangement to share gain information across sectors.<br>
The base station 512 is comprised of the following elemenls connected in series:    cell site modems 521, quadrature signal logic 522, digitat-to-analog<br><br>
conversion and filter 523, up-converter 524, gain control 525, power amplifier 526, power monitor 527, and antenna 528. The quadrature signal power control logic 415 of FIG. 4- is represented by quadrature signal logic 522, gain control 525, and power monitor 527 on PIG. 5. Aside from the quadrature signal logic 522, those skilled in :he art are familiar with these elements and their operation.<br>
The cell site modems 521 produce a CDMA signal comprised of quadrature signals I and Q. Quadrature CDMA signals T and Q are well-known and are baseband signals to be transmitted using carriers of the same frequency, but in phase quadrature. The cell site modems 521 may apply forward error correction coding before transferring the quadrature signals I and Q to the quadrature signal logic 522.<br>
The quadrature signal logic 522 receives the quadrature I and Q signals from the cell site modems 521 and a transmit power (Pout) signal 518 from, the power monitor 527. In response, the quadrature signal logic 522 processes the quadrature components of the CDMA signal to generate a power control signal 517 and a capacity control signal 519. The processing entails: 1) processing the quadrature I and Q components to determine a quadrature CDMA signal power value, 2) comparing the quadrature CDMA signal power value to the transmit power value from the Pout signal 518, and 3) generating the power control signal 517 and the capacity control signal 519 based on the comparison. The quadrature signal logic 522 provides the quadrature I and Q signals to the digital-to-analog conversion and filter 523,<br>
The digital-to-analog conversion and filter 523 converts the I and Q signals to analog and filters out components outside of the desired bandwidth. The digital-to-analog conversion and filter 523 provides the analog I and Q signals to the up-converter 524. The up-converter 524 modulates the analog I and Q signals with intermediate and radio frequencies to form an RF CDMA signal and provides the RF CDMA signal to the gain control 525. The gain control 525 adjusts the gam of the RF CDMA signal based on the power control signal 517 and provides the gain-adjusted RF CDMA signal to the power amplifier 526. The power amplifier 526 amplifies the RF CDMA signal and provides the amplified RF CDMA signal to the power monitor 527. The power monitor 527 monitors the transmit power of the RP CDMA signal and provides the Pout signal 518 to the quadrature signal logic 522. The power monitor 527 provides the RF CDMA signal to the antenna 52S. The antenna 52S transmits the RF CDMA signal 407.<br>
FIG. 6 depicts the quadrature signal logic 522 from FIG. 5, The quadrature signal logic 522 includes: 1' block 630, Q2 block 632, summing block 634, ratio block 636, and control block 63S.   The quadrature signal logic 522<br><br>
receives the quadrature signal I from the cell site modems 521 and provides it to the I2 block 630 and to the digital-to-analog conversion and filter 523. The quadrature signal logic 522 receives the quadrature signal Q from the cell site modems 521 and provides it to the Q' block 632 and to the digital-to-anaiog conversion and filter 523.<br>
The l2 block 630 squares the quadrature signal I and provides the squared value to the summing block 634. The Q' block 632 squares tiie quadrature signal Q and provides the squared value to the summing block 634. The summmg block 634 adds the two squared values together to generate a quadrature CDMA signal power (I" + Q') value. The summing block 634 provides the 1'+ Q" value to the ratio block 636.<br>
The ratio block 636 receives the Pout signal 518 indicating the transmit power of the CDMA signal 407. The ratio block 636 determines a ratio that equals I2+Q2 I Pout. The ratio block 636 provides the ratio to the control block 638.<br>
The control block 63S compares the ratio to a pre-determined value. Those skilled in the art are familiar with how to determine this pre-determined value by considering such factors as cell size, maximum rated power, minimum pilot signal strength at receiver, saturation, quantization errors, Ec/Io required at mobile device, and dynamic range of signal path. The control block then generates the power control signal 517 to cause the gain control 525 to adjust the gain of the CDMA signal. The control block 638 configures the power control signal 517 so the ratio moves closer to the pre-determined value. The control block also generates the capacity control signal 519 to indicate an estimate of the excess forward link capacity of the base station 412. Tne estimate is typically given in a number of additional simultaneous calls that can be handled by the base station 412. The control block 638 transfers the capacit\^ control signal 519 to a base station control system (not shown).<br>
FIG. 7 shows the desired relationship between Pout and the I2+ Q2 value. The points X and Y represent operational measurements, and the arrows represent the control applied through the control signal 517 to the gain control 525 to move the ratio closer to the pre-determined value. Those skilled in the art are aware that the sione of the pre-determined value blossoms during start-up arid wilts during shut-down. Based on this document, those skilled in the art will appreciate how to assemble the quadrature signal logic 522 using conventional circuitry and software.<br>
