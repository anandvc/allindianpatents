				<td>ALIASING REDUCTION USING COMPLEX-EXPONENTIAL MODULATED<br>
FILTERS ANKS<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to the area of subsampled digital filterbanks and provides a new method and<br>
apparatus for substantial reduction of impairments emerging from modifications, for example<br>
quantization or attenuation, of the spectral coefficients or subband signals of digital filterbanks. The<br>
invention is applicable to digital equalizers ["An Efficient 20 Band Digital Audio Equalizer" A. J. S.<br>
Ferreira. J. M. N. Viera, AES preprint 98* Convention 1995 February 25-28 Paris, NY, USA], adaptive<br>
filters (Adaptive Filtering in Subbands with Critical Sampling: Analysis, Experiments, and Application to<br>
Acoustic Echo Cancellation" A. Gilloire, M. Vetterii, IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing, vol. 40.<br>
no. 8, August, 1992], multiband companders, and to audio coding systems using high frequency<br>
reconstruction (HFR), where a digital filterbank is used for the adaptive adjustment of the spectral<br>
envelope, such as the Spectral Band Replication (SBR) system (WO 98/57436].<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
A digital filter bank is a collection of two or more parallel digital filters. The analysis filter bank splits the<br>
incoming signal into a number of separate signals named subband signals (or spectral coefficients) The<br>
filter bank is critically sampled (or maximally decimated) when the total number of subband samples per<br>
unit time is the same as that for the input signal. The synthesis filter bank combines these subband signals<br>
into an output signal. A popular type of critically sampled filterbanks is the cosine modulated filterbarik.<br>
The filters in the cosine modulated system are obtained by cosine modulation of a low-pass filter, a so-<br>
called prototype filter. The cosine modulated banks offer very effective implementations and arc often<br>
used in natural audio codecs ["Introduction to Perceptual Coding" K. Brandenburg, AJES, Collected<br>
Papers on Digital Audio Bitrate Reduction, 1996]. However, any attempt to alter the subband samples or<br>
spectral coefficients, e.g. by applying an equalizing gain curve or quantizing the samples, renders severe<br>
aliasing artifacts in the output signal<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention shows that impairments emerging from modifications of the subband signals can be<br>
significantly reduced by extending a cosine modulated filterbank with an imaginary sine modulated part,<br>
forming a complex-exponential modulated filterbank. The sine extension eliminates the main alias terms<br>
present in the cosine modulated filterbank. Moreover, the invention presents a method, referred to as alias<br>
term minimization (ATM), for optimization of the prototype filter. The complex-exponential modulation<br>
creates complex-valued subband signals that can be interpreted as the analytic signals of the signals<br>
obtained from the real part of the filterbank, i.e. the underlying cosine modulated filterbank. This feature<br>
provides an inherent measure of the instantaneous energy of the subband signals<br><br>
The main steps for operation of the complex-exponential modulated filterbank according to the present<br>
invention are:<br>
1.	The design of a symmetric low-pass prototype filter with cutoff frequency Ï€/2M, optimized for a<br>
desired aliasing rejection and passband flatness;<br>
2.	The construction of an M-channel filterbank by complex-exponential modulation of the optimized<br>
prototype filter;<br>
3.	The filtering of a real-valued time domain signal through the analysis part of the filterbank,<br>
4.	The modification of the complex-valued subband signals according to a desired, possibly time-<br>
varying, equalizer setting;<br>
5.	The filtering of the modified complex-valued subband samples through the synthesis part of the<br>
filterbank; and<br>
6.	The computation of the real part of the complex-valued time domain output signal obtained from<br>
the synthesis part of the filterbank.<br>
The most attractive applications of the invention are improvement of various types of digital equalizers,<br>
adaptive filters, multiband companders and adaptive envelope adjusting filter-banks used in HFR systems.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
It should be understood that the present invention is applicable on a range of implementations that<br>
incorporates digital filterbanks other than those explicitly mentioned in this patent.<br><br>
Digital f ilterbanks<br>
A digital filter bank is a collection of two or more parallel digital filters that share a common input or a<br>
common output ("Multiratc Systems and Filter Banks" P.P. Vaidyanathan Prentice Hall. Englewood<br>
Cliffs, NJ, 1993]. When sharing a common input the filter bank is called an analysis bank. The analysis<br>
bank splits the incoming signal into M separate signals called sub-band signals. The analysis filters are<br>
denoted HA(z), where k = 0 ... M-l. The filter bank is critically sampled (or maximally decimated) when<br>
the subband signals are decimated by a factor M The total number of subband samples per unit time is<br>
then the same as the number of samples per unit time for the input signal. The synthesis bank combines<br>
these subband signals into a common output signal. The synthesis filters are denoted Fk(Z) for<br>
k = 0... M-1. A maximally decimated filter hank with M channels (subbands) is shown in Fig. 1. The<br>
analysis part 101 produces the signals Vk (Z) which constitute the signals to be transmitted, stored or<br>
modified, from the input signal X(z). The synthesis part 102 recombines the signals Vk (z) to the output<br>
signal X(z).<br>
The recombination of Vk (z) to obtain the approximation X(z) of the original signal X(z) is subject to<br>
several errors. One of these is aliasing, due to the decimation and interpolation of the subbands. Other<br>
errors are phase and amplitude distortion.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
For a cosine modulated system, the dominant terms in the composite alias component matrix are the first<br>
row and four diagonals. The three-dimensional plot of Fig.2 illustrates the magnitudes of the components<br>
in this matrix The first row holds the terms from the transfer function, Eq.(8), while the four diagonals<br>
primarily consist of the main alias terms, i.e. the aliasing due to overlap between fitters and their closest<br>
neighbors. It is easily seen that the main alias terms emerge from overlap in frequency between either the<br>
filters negative passbands with frequency modulated versions of the positive passbands, or reciprocally,<br>
the filters positive passbands with frequency modulated versions of the negative passbands. Summing the<br>
terms of the rows in the composite alias component matrix, i.e. calculating the alias gains, results in<br>
cancellation of the main alias terras. The aliasing is canceled in a pairwtse manner, where the first main<br>
alias term is canceled by the second in the same row. Superimposed on the main alias terms are also other<br>
smaller alias terras. If the prototype filter characteristics is so mat the transition- and stop-band of the<br>
filters have substantial overlap with their modulated versions, these alias terms will be large. As an<br>
example, the second and the last row consists of alias terms induced by. the overlap of filters with their<br>
closest modulated versions. For a PR system, these smaller alias terras also cancels completely when<br>
summing the terms for the alias gains. In the pseudo QMF system, however, these terms remain.<br>
Complex-Exponential Modulated Filterbanks<br>
Extending the cosine modulation to complex-exponential modulation according to the present invention<br>
yields the analysis filters hk(n) as<br><br>
using the same notation as before. This can be viewed as adding an imaginary part to the real-valued<br>
filterbank, where the imaginary part consists of sine modulated versions of the same prototype filter.<br>
Considering a real-valued input signal, the output from the filter bank can be interpreted as a set of<br>
subband signals, where the real and the imaginary parts arc Hilbert transforms of each other The<br>
resulting subbands are thus the analytic signals of the real-valued output obtained from the cosine<br>
modulated filterbank. Hence, due to the complex-valued representation, the subband signals arc<br>
oversampled by a factor two.<br>
The synthesis filters are extended in the same way as<br><br>
Eq.(22) and (23) implies that the output from the synthesis bank is complex-valued Using matrix<br>
notation, where C, is a matrix with analysis filters from Eq (14), and S, is a matrix with filters as<br><br>
7<br><br>
As seen from Eq.(26), the real part consists of two terms; the output from the ordinary cosine modulated<br>
filterbank and an output from a sine modulated filterbank. It is easily verified that if a cosine modulated<br>
interbank has the PR property, then its sine modulated version, with a change of sign, constitutes a PR<br>
system as well. Thus, by taking the real part of the output, the complex-exponential modulated system<br>
offers the same reconstruction accuracy as the corresponding cosine modulated version.<br>
The complex-exponential modulated system can be extended to handle also complex-valued input<br>
signals. By extending the number of channels to 2Mt i.e adding the filters for the negative frequencies,<br>
and keeping me imaginary part of the output signal, a pseudo QMF or a PR system for complex-valued<br>
signals is obtained.<br>
Examining the composite alias component matrix from Eq.(21), the main alias diagonals vanish for the<br>
complex-exponential modulated filterbank. This is easily understood since the complex-exponential<br>
modulated filterbank has only one passband for every filter. In other words, the filterbank is free from<br>
main alias terms, and do not rely on the pairwise aliasing cancellation mentioned above. The composite<br>
alias component matrix has the dominant terms on the first row only. Fig.3 shows the magnitude of the<br>
components in the resulting matrix. Depending on the prototype filter characteristics, the terms on rows 1<br>
through M-l, are more or less attenuated. The absence of main alias terms makes the aliasing cancellation<br>
constraint from the cosine (or sine) modulated filterbank obsolete in the complex-exponential modulated<br>
version. Both the analysis and synthesis filters can thus be found from<br><br><br>
The notation X*(z) is the Z-transform of the complex-conjugated sequence x(n)  From Eq.(4), it<br>
follows that the transform of the real part of the output signal is<br><br>
where it is used that the input signal x(n) is real-valued. Eq.(29) may after manipulation be written<br><br>
By inspecting Eq.(30), and recalling the transform of Eq.(28), it is obvious that the real part of ao(n) mast<br>
be a dirac pulse for a PR system. Moreover, the real part of AM2(Ï€) must be zero and the alias gains, for<br>
l= 1 ... M/2-1, must satisfy<br>
In pseudo QMF systems, Eq.(31) holds true only approximately. Moreover, the real part of a0(n) is not<br>
exactly a dirac-pulse, nor is the real part of aM/2(n) exactly zero.<br>
Modification of subband signals<br>
Changing the gains of the channels in a cosine modulated filterbank, i.e. using the analysis/synthesis<br>
system as an equalizer, renders severe distortion due to the main alias terms. Say for example that the<br>
intention is to adjust an eight-channel filterbank for a band-pass response, where except for the second<br>
and third channel all subband signals are set to zero. The composite alias component matrix from Eq.(21)<br>
is then an S x 8 matrix where all elements are zero except for the elements on the second and third<br>
column, Fig.4. There are seven significant alias terms left as indicated in the figure. The aliasing from<br>
rows three and five will be canceled, since the main alias terms in these rows have the same gains, i.e. the<br>
pairwise cancellation is working intentionally. In rows two, four and six however, these are single alias<br>
terms, since their corresponding alias terms have zero gain. The alias cancellation will hence not work as<br>
intended, and the aliasing in the output signal will be substantial.<br>
From this example it is obvious that a substantial improvement is achieved when using complex-<br>
exponential modulated filterbanks as equalizers. The 8-channel system depicted in Fig.4 has a prototype<br>
fitter of order 128. The total aliasing attenuation is only 16 dB in the above equalizer example. Moving to<br>
complex-exponential modulation gives an aliasing attenuation of 95 dB. Due to the non-existing main<br><br>
alias terms, the resulting aliasing is dependent only on the suppression of the alias terms emanating from<br>
overlap between filters and their modulated versions It is thus of great importance to design the prototype<br>
filter for maximum suppression of the alias gains terms The first term on the RHS of Eq (30) evaluated<br>
on the unit circle gives the error energy e, of the transfer function as<br><br>
The energy of the total aliasing et can be calculated by evaluating all remaining terms on the RHS of<br>
Eq.{30) on the unit circle as<br><br>
Due to symmetry, Eq.(9) and the fact<br><br>
the terms within the curly braces of the sum in Eq.(33) are equal. The total aliasing energy thus has M/2-1<br>
terms as <br>
The minimization of the alias gain terms is done by optimizing the prototype filter This is preferably<br>
accomplished by minimizing a composite objective function, using standard nonlinear optimization<br>
algorithms, for example the Downhill Simplex Method ["Numerical Recipes in C, The An of Scientific<br>
Computing, Second Edition" W. H- Press, S A. Teukolsky, W. T. Vetterimg, B. P. Flannery, Cambridge<br>
University Press, NY, 1992]. For alias term minimization (ATM) of the prototype filter according to the<br>
invention, the objective function looks like<br><br>
During the optimization, a random equalization curve is applied to the filterbank when calculating Ea i.e.<br>
the analysis and synthesis filters are multiplied with gainfactors gk as<br><br><br>
and the resulting filters are used when calculating the alias gain terms <br>
forl = l ...M-1.<br>
In Fig.5, the alias gains of five different complex-exponential modulated systems are compared. Four of<br>
these are 8-channel systems and one is a 64-channel system. AH of the systems have prototype filter<br>
lengths of 128. The dotted trace and the solid trace with stars shows alias components for two pseudo<br>
QMF systems, where one is alias term minimized. The dashed and the dash-dotted traces are the<br>
components for two 8-channel perfect reconstruction systems, where again one of the systems is alias<br>
term minimized. The solid trace is the alias components for a complex-exponential modulated lapped<br>
transform (MLT). All the systems arc adjusted for band-pass responses according to the example above,<br>
and the results are tabulated in Table 1. The rejection of total aliasing is calculated as the inverse of<br>
Eq.(33). The passband flatness is calculated as the inverse of Eq.(32) with the integration interval<br>
adjusted for the bandpass response.<br><br>
As seen from the numbers in Table 1, a substantial improvement is achieved when moving from the 64-<br>
channel MLT to the 8-channel PR systems. The MLT is a perfect reconstruction system and has only<br>
(W+l) / 2M = 1 coefficient per polyphase component The number of coefficients for the 8-channel PR<br>
systems are 128 / 16 - 8. This enables filters with higher stopband attenuation and higher rejection of<br>
alias terms. Moreover, it is seen that alias term minimization of the PR system rejects the aliasing and<br>
improves the passband flatness significantly. Comparing the pseudo QMF systems and the PR systems, it<br>
is clear mat the aliasing rejection improves by 40 dB while almost preserving the passband flatness. An<br>
additional alias rejection of approximately 20 dB and improved passband flatness of 10 dB is achieved<br>
when minmuzing the alias terms. Thus, it is clear that the perfect reconstruction constraint imposes<br>
limitations to a filterbank used in an equalization system. A pseudo QMF system can always be designed<br>
for adequate reconstruction accuracy, since all practical digital implementations have limited resolution in<br>
the numeric representation. For both the pseudo QMF and the PR system, it is obvious that an optimum<br>
system is built on a prototype filter mat has large rejection of the stopband. This imposes the usage of<br>
prototype filters with relative lengths longer than the windows used in the MLT.<br>
A great advantage of the complex-exponential modulated system is that the instantaneous energy is easily<br>
calculated since the sub-band signals constitute the analytic signals of the real-valued subband signals<br><br>
obtained from a cosine modulated filterbank. This is a property of great value in for example adaptive<br>
fillets, automatic gain controls (AGC), in multiband companders, and in spectral band replication systems<br>
(SBR), where a filterbank is used for the spectral envelope adjustment. The averaged energy within a<br>
subband k might be calculated as<br><br>
where VK(n) is the subband samples of channel A, and w(n) is a window of length 2L-1 centered around<br>
n = 0. This measure is then used as an input parameter for the adaptation or gain-calculation algorithms<br>
Practical implementations<br>
Using a standard PC or DSP. real-time operation of a complex-exponential modulated filterbank is<br>
possible. The filterbank may also be hard-coded on a custom chip. Fig. 6 shows the structure for an<br>
effective implementation of the analysis part of a complex-exponential modulated filterbank system. The<br>
analogue input signal is first fed to an A/D converter 601. The digital time domain signal is fed to a shift<br>
register holding 2M samples shifting M samples at time 602. The signals from the shift register are then<br>
filtered through the polyphase coefficients of the prototype filter 603. The filtered signals are<br>
subsequently combined 604 and in parallel transformed with a DCT-IV 605 and a DST-IV 606 transform.<br>
The outputs from the cosine and sine transforms constitute the real and the imaginary parts of the subband<br>
samples respectively. The gains of the subband samples are modified according to the current spectral<br>
envelope adjuster setting 607.<br>
An effective implementation of the synthesis part of a complex-exponential modulated system is shown<br>
in Fig.7. The subband samples are first multiplied with complex-valued twiddlefactors 701, and the real<br>
part is modulated with a DCT-IV 702 and the imaginary part with a DST-IV 703 transform. The outputs<br>
from the transforms arc combined 704 and fed through the polyphase components of the prototype filter<br>
705. The time domain output signal is obtained from the shift register 706. Finally, the digital output<br>
signal is converted back to an analogue waveform 707<br>

modulated filterbank systems according to the present invention. It is understood mat modifications and<br>

followed by a polyphase filter module (705), and a shift register and adding means (706),<br>
wherein at the output of a shift register and adding means (706) said real-valued time domain<br>
output signal is obtained.<br>
6. Method of analysis filtering using an analysis filter bank part for filtering real-valued time<br>
domain signals, where said filter bank has M filter bank channels and said channels have filter<br>
coefficients emerging from complex-exponential modulation of a symmetric low-pass<br>
prototype filter po(n), having filter order N, wherein said filter coefficients are based on<br><br>
where k indicates a channel index, Â« indicates a filter coefficient index and hk(n) indicates a<br>
complex-valued filter coefficient of an index n belonging to a filter bank channel of index k,<br>
wherein n = 0, 1, ...,N, and k=0, 1, ..., M-l,<br>
wherein said low-pass prototype filter has a filter order N that is higher than 2M-1, where Mis<br>
the number of channels in said digital filterbank, or<br>
wherein said low-pass prototype filter has been optimized by minimizing a composite<br>
objective function Îµtot(a) as<br>
where a is a weighting constant, s, is the passband error and Îµa is the aliasing error, or<br>
wherein said analysis filterbank part is used for the estimation of energy measures in a high<br>
frequency reconstruction system, or<br>
wherein said analysis filterbank part is used as part of an envelope adjusting filterbank in a<br>
high frequency reconstruction system.<br>
7. Method of synthesis filtering using a synthesis filter bank part for filtering complex-valued<br>
subband signals, where said filter bank has M filter bank channels and said channels have<br>
filter coefficients emerging from complex-exponential modulation of a symmetric low-pass<br>
prototype filter po(n), having filter order N, wherein said filter coefficients are based on<br><br><br>
where k indicates a channel index, n indicates a filter coefficient index and fk(n) indicates a<br>
complex-valued filter coefficient of an index n belonging to a filter bank channel of index k,<br>
wherein n = 0, 1, ...,N, and k = 0,1,..., M-1, further comprising means for adding output<br>
signals from the filter bank channels to obtain a complex-valued time domain signal and<br>
means for taking the real part, in order to obtain a real-valued time domain output signal,<br>
wherein said low-pass prototype filter has a filter order N that is higher than 2M-1, where Mis<br>
the number of channels in said digital filterbank, or<br>
wherein said low-pass prototype filter has been optimized by minimizing a composite<br>
objective function Îµtot(a) as<br>
Îµtot(a) = aet+(l-a)Îµa<br>
where a is a weighting constant, s, is the passband error and Îµa is the aliasing error, or<br>
wherein said synthesis filterbank part is used as part of an envelope adjusting filterbank in a<br>
high frequency reconstruction system.<br><br>
The invention employs complex-exponential modulation of a low-pass prototype<br>
filter and a new method for optimizing the characteristics of this filter. The<br>
invention substantially reduces artifacts due to aliasing emerging from<br>
independent modifications of subband signals, for example when using a<br>
filterbank as an spectral equalizer. The invention is preferably implemented in<br>
software, running on a standard PC or a digital signal processor (DSP), but can<br>
also be hardcoded on a custom chip. The invention offers essential<br>
improvements for various types of digital equalizers, adaptive filters, multiband<br>
companders and spectral envelope adjusting filterbanks used in high frequency<br>
reconstruction (HFR) systems.</td>
