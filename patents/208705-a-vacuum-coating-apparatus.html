				<td>The invention at hand concerns a substrate carrier for vacuum coating plants for the vacuum evaporation of antiref lection coatings onto optical substrate surfaces, such as plastic spectacle lenses, which can be clamped onto a plurality of such carriers, located above replaceable evaporation sources in a container that can be evacuated.<br>
For  known plants of this type,  designed  for the<br>
evaporation of at least one surface layer onto optical<br>
substrates in a vacuum, in particular spectacle lenses, a predetermined number of such substrates are removed from the plane in which the substrate surfaces were subjected to the effects of replaceable evaporation sources following the depositing of, as a rule, several layers, and an equal number of substrate surfaces are moved into this plane so that these can subsequently also be coated once or several times.<br>
A rotating table, which can be placed under vacuum, can be used for this, for example, said table having a plurality of stations arranged around its circumference for the removable<br>
fastening of substrates. This plant further comprises at least one evaporation source that is operationally connected to the facing substrate surfaces. In this case, each station is provided with a substrate carrier with holding means for the removable fastening of one each substrate. If the individual antireflection coatings have been deposited successfully on one side of the substrate surfaces, the substrate carriers are reversed by turning the rotating table and the other substrate surfaces are coated.<br>
Furthermore, it is known to design substrate carriers as so-called calottes, so that a plurality of substrates can be installed on the plane, circular-segment shaped carriers. A plurality of such calottes extend respectively dome-shaped and rotatable over the upper portion of the container, which makes it possible to rotate a plurality of substrates simultaneously with each calotte.<br>
One problem with such arrangements is that the coating stream that rises conically in the center of the container requires an exact angle position of the substrate surfaces to be coated to the conical stream in order to achieve an optimum, uniform precipitation on each surface.<br>
If the substrate carriers with one each substrate are arranged such that they radially project from a rotating table and can be rotated by 180° around an axis, this can be achieved easily by installing the axes at a slant.<br>
For the calotte-shaped substrate carriers where a plurality ol" aubnUraLon are to bo mounted on blio piano, circular-segment shaped carriers, this may not actually be sufficient.<br>
Substrate holders have already been provided at these calotte-shaped substrate carriers, which can be swiveled freely together with the substrate toward both sides of the carrier<br>
plate plane, up to a predetermined angle.<br>
However, such substrate holders at the carriers are v.ery<br>
complicated and prone to failures.<br>
Thus it is the object of the invention at hand to design substrate carriers of the aforementioned type in such a way that these in a very simple way always bring the substrate surfaces to be vacuum coated into an exact angular position relative to the coating stream that rises cone-shaped in the center of the container, in order to achieve an optimum, unform precipitation of all surfaces.<br>
Statement of Invention<br>
According to the present invention there is [provided a vacuum coating apparatus comprising:<br><br>
(a)	at least two radially adjoining segrrfents each accommodating at least one<br>
substrate to be coated; and<br>
(b)	a hinge interconnecting said adjoining segments for allowing tilting motion<br>
a substrate carrier accommodating subs<br>
an evaporation source vertically spaced<br>

er;<br>
carrier comprises:<br>
mother up to a predetermined angle so can be angled with respect to said<br><br>
:oating plants, designed to deposit urfaces such as plastic spectacle of such carriers, located above that can be evacuated, this can be or one each substrate are provided respectively one hinge or joint<br>
With   a substrate carrier for vacuum antireflection coatings on optical substrate s lenses, which can be clamped onto a plurality replaceable evaporation sources in a container achieved in that at least two receiving ranges in radial extension, between which receiving Raiges that ubdivides the substrate carrier into segments is located, around which the substrate carrier segments with the substrate can be swiveled toward both sides relative to each other at a predetermined angle.<br>
Independent of the shape of the substrate carrier and independent of its number of segments carrying the substrates and subdivided by hinges or joints, it is now possible that after each turning of the substrate carrier by 180°, the substrate surfaces to be coated will always assume an ex^ct angle position to the coating beam that rises conically in the center of the container, thereby permitting an optimum, even precipitation on each substrate surface.<br>
One preferred embodiment is made possible by at least two, radially extending segments that adjoin the rotational axis, which consist of circular fastening components for the substrates and which are connected by hinges or joints, around which the substrate carrier segments with the substrate can be swiveled freely toward both sides, relative to each other and at a predetermined angle. Or it is made possible by a calotte-shaped plate, which is subdivided into at least two segments by hinges, around which the substrate carrier segments with the substrate can be swiveled toward both sides, relative to each other and up to a predetermined angle, wherein at least the center segment has means for holding at least two adjoining substrates, or by a strip-type arrangement, divided into at<br>
least two receiving regions for one each substrate, between which receiving regions one each hinge or joint for subdividing the substrate carrier into segments is located, around which the substrate carrier segments with the substrate can be swiveled freely toward both sides, relative to each other and up to a predetermined angle.<br>
Exemplary embodiments of the inventive subject-matter are explained in more detail in the following with the aid of the drawing. Shown are in:<br>
Figure 1 A simplified, diagrammatic illustration of a view from the side of a vacuum coating plant with the inventive substrate carriers; and Figure 2 An enlarged-scale view from above of exemplary embodiments of inventive substrate carriers.<br>
The vacuum coating plant indicated in Figure 1 for the depositing of antireflection coatings onto optical substrates, for example plastic spectacle lenses, comprises a container that is known per se (not shown) , which can be evacuated via a vacuum pump.<br>
In the upper chamber region of this container is a so-called reversible carrier device 1 with a plurality of inventive substrate carriers 2, arranged radially around the circular reversible carrier device 1, of which two are recognizable here, which are supported respectively on a<br>
rotating axis 3 such that they can be rotated temporarily by 180°, wherein each substrate carrier 2 comprises means for a clamped holding of a substrate to be coated on both sides or for holding two substrates to be coated on one side (not shown).<br>
The inventive substrate carrier 2 is described in more detail in the following.<br>
A centrally located evaporation source 4 is indicated in the lower region of the container, which generates in the known way a cone-shaped vacuum coating stream 5 for vacuum coating the surfaces of the substrates held by the substrate carriers 2.<br>
In order to bring the substrate surfaces to be coated always into an exact angle position relative to the cone-shaped coating stream rising in the center of the container after each turning of the substrate carrier 2 by 180°, and to achieve an optimum, uniform precipitation on each substrate surface, at least two receiving regions for one each substrate are provided according to the invention in radial extension of the substrate carrier 2, between which receiving regions one each hinge or joint 6 is located that subdivides the substrate carrier into segments 12, 22, around which the substrate carrier segments with the substrate can be swiveled freely toward both sides, relative to each other and up to a predetermined angle, as is indicated in Figure 1 with the dashed line.<br>
Regardless of the shape of the substrate carrier 2 and regardless of the number of segments 12, 22 that carry the substrates and are subdivided by hinges or joints 6, it is now possible for the substrate surfaces to be coated to always assume an exact angle position to the vacuum coating stream 5 that rises cone-shaped in the center of the container, which results in an optimum, uniform precipitation for each substrate surface, as can be seen in Figure 1.<br>
The design variant of a substrate carrier 2 according^to Figure 2 provides for three radially extending segments 12, 22 and 23 that adjoin the rotational axis 3 and consist of circular holders for the substrates and which are here connected by two hinges or joints 6.<br>
For the design variant of a substrate carrier 2 according to Figure 3, the substrate carrier 2 consists of a calotte-shaped plate, which is also subdivided into three segments 12, 22 and 23 by hinges 6, wherein the center segment 22 in this case has means for accepting three side-by-side arranged substrates.<br>
Depending on the size of the substrates relative to the calotte-shaped substrate carrier 2, it is of course possible to attach even more substrates.<br>
For the design variant of a substrate carrier 2 according to Figure 4, a strip-shaped substrate carrier 2 with three receiving regions is provided for one each substrate. A hinge<br>
or joint 6 respectively is located between these receiving regions, which subdivides the substrate carrier into segments 12, 22 and 23, around which the substrate carrier segments with the substrate can be swiveled toward both sides, relative to each other and up to a predetermined angle.<br>
It follows from the above that the shape of the substrate carrier can vary, insofar as it permits the substrate carrier segments with the substrate to be swiveled freely toward both sides, relative to each other and up to a predetermined angJLe.<br>
The following is claimed:<br><br><br><br>
We claim:<br>
1.	A vacuum coating apparatus comprising:<br>
a substrate carrier (2) accommodating substrate to be coated; an evaporation source (4) vertically spaced from the carrier and emitting a vapour stream onto the substrates mounted on the carrier;<br>
