The present application hereby claims the benefit of the continuation-in-part patent applications Serial No s. 11/931534, 11/931415, 11/931473, 11/931658, all filed on October 31, 2007, and the non-provisional patent application Serial No. 11/765614, filed on June 20, 2007, the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates, in general, to multi-colored lustrous pearlescent pigments.<br>
Along with gem stones (e.g., diamond, ruby, emerald, topaz, opal, jade), and precious metals (e.g., gold, silver, platinum), pearls are among the most prized possessions (or luxury items) for human beings for millenniums. Beside their natural beauty, the brilliant color and luster, they are often associated with social status and level of well-being. As a result, and not surprisingly, the trend of cosmetics makeup is to emulate or recreate these "natural" and "aesthetic" appearances of pearl, gem and precious metals with less expensive materials such as interference pigments (e.g., metal oxide coated mica). The most common types of pearlescent pigments are micronized titanium dioxide, metal oxide coated mica, metal oxide coated alumina, metal oxide coated silica, basic lead carbonate, bismuth oxychloride, and natural fish silver.<br>
Metal oxide coated mica pigments are characterized by excellent optical, chemical, mechanical, toxicological, and environmental properties. Natural or synthetic mica, and alternative supports, such as aluminum flakes, or Si02 platelets, can be used alone, or as a support for titanium dioxide, iron oxide (Fe203 or Fe304), iron ferrocyanide (Iron Blue or Prussian Blue), tin oxide, and chromium oxide. The color space defined by these coated mica-based pigments is based on the type of coating (e.g. metal oxide, colorant, etc.) used, the layer thickness, and the number of coated layers.<br>
Among the natural pearls, the most expensive are black pearls, which come with various undertone and color flops. To faithfully emulate this aesthetic optical effect in cosmetic makeup is one of the top challenges facing a cosmetic pigment maker and formulator. The traditional approach to these pigments is to blend dark solid-color inorganic pigment (e.g., carbon black) with white platy pearlescent pigments (e.g., TiO2 coated mica, TiO2 coated borosilicate, TiO2 coated alumina). The platy interference pigment provides the luster, brilliance (reflection), transparency and depth of field. The solid-color pigment(s) provide(s) the dark undertone and surface coverage. However, this type of blend usually appears to be much "dirtier", "lack luster", and "lack transparency" compared to the natural pearl. The primary reason for that is fouling of the smooth surface of white pearlescent pigment by the solid- color pigment granules, which leads to light scattering and disruption of light interference.<br>
Metal oxide coated platelet pigments may be magnetic or exhibit magnetic susceptibility. When placed into a liquid coating, regions of the coated pigment may be aligned by an externally applied magnetic field and produce a goniochromatic, or angle dependent optical effect. This effect may be used to create an impression of a two- or three-dimensional image. After the pigments have been aligned, the coating may be cured to solidify the optical effect. Examples of pigments and methods of aligning them<br><br>
are discussed in US 6589331, US 6902807, US 5223360, US 6759097, and US 7258900. However, the magnetic pigments are significantly limited in terms of color space. The typical colors available are metallic black, grey shades, or bichromic shades characterized by a black or reddish brown absorbance color combined with a weak interference color.<br>
A need exists to expand the existing color space of metal oxide coated pigments to more vibrant, lustrous colored shades, as well as, antique dark pearlescent shades, using a processing method that allows for optimal control of color and opacity. In addition, a need exists for more colorful magnetic pigments that have a larger color contrast between aligned and non-aligned pigments.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to lustrous, pearlescent pigments with controlled opacity, comprising a substrate and a first layer, wherein the first layer comprises iron oxide, wherein the iron in the iron oxide comprises from about 1% to about 30% Fe(II) and from about 70% to about 99% Fe(III).<br>
Iron oxide coated substrates exhibit intensely colored pearlescent pigments with high luster. Varying the substrate, the iron oxide layer thickness, and the amount of Fe(II) and Fe(III) in the layer will change the color, luminosity, and transparency of the pigment. The mean thickness of the first layer may be from about 1 nm to about 350 nm, from about 10 nm to about 350 nm, or from about 10 nm to about 250 nm.<br>
In one embodiment, the pigment may comprise a second layer located between the substrate and the first layer, wherein the second layer has a refractive index of greater<br>
than about 1.6 or less than about 1.4. The second layer may have a refractive index equal to or greater than about 1.8. Examples of compounds that may be used as the second layer are: TiO2, Fe203, Zr02&gt; Sn02, Cr203, BiOCI, and ZnO. The second layer may comprise one or more materials. The second layer may be TiO2. The second layer may be an iron oxide, such as Fe203, Fe304, FeOOH, FeO, and Fe(0H)3. The mean thickness of the second layer may be from about 50 nm to about 800 nm, or from about 100 nm to about 600 nm.<br>
In another embodiment, titanium oxide coated mica pigments exhibit pearlescent effects resulting from reflection and light interference. The interference color and luster is dependent on the thickness of the TiO2 surface layer and its corresponding surface roughness. This initial interference color of the pigment, prior to the coating of the first layer is apparent when viewed against a black background. It has been surprisingly discovered that FeOOH deposition followed by reduction results in the advancement of the interference color and a significant increase in opacity of TiO2 coated platelet-like pigments. This process transforms the transparent, TiO2 coated mica, into a lustrous colored pearlescent pigment with increased opacity. The thickness of the deposited FeOOH layer controls the magnitude of the color progression and opacity. For relatively thick FeOOH layers, the interference color progresses to the next shade and the pigment approaches complete opacity.<br>
In order to improve the light, water repellency, weather stability, texture, and dispersion ability, it is frequently advisable to subject the finished pigment to surface treatment, depending on the area of application. Examples of surface treatments are methicone (poly(oxy(methylsilylene))), metal soap, fatty acid, hydrogenated lecithin, dimethicone (polydimethylsiloxane), fluorinated compounds, amino acids, N- acylamino acids, glyceryl rosinates, silanes, and combinations. Many of the processes are described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,790,452; U.S. Pat. No. 5,368,639; U.S. Pat. No. 5,326,392; U.S. Pat. No. 5,486,631; U.S. Pat. No. 4,606,914; U.S. Pat.

Ponjee, Philips Technical Review, Vol. 44, No. 3, 81 ff; and P. H. Harding J. C. Berg, J. Adhesion Sci. Technol. Vol.1 1 No. 4, pp. 471-493. This post- coating may further increase the chemical stability or simplify handling of the pigment, in particular incorporation into various media. In order to improve the wettability, dispersibility and/or compatibility with the user media, functional coatings of A1203 or Zr02 or mixtures thereof may be applied to the pigment surface.<br>
In one embodiment, coupling agents may be used to form an outer layer on the pearlescent pigment. Suitable coupling agents are disclosed in EP 632 109. Examples include, silanes, zirconium aluminates, zirconates, and titanates. The silanes may possess the structure Y-(CH2)n-SiX3 in which n is 2-8, Y is an organofunctional group, e.g. an amino, methacrylic, vinyl, alkyl, aryl, halogen and/or epoxy group, and X is a silicon-functional group which following its hydrolysis reacts with active sites of an inorganic substrate or by condensation with other silicon compounds. This group Y may comprise, for example a hydroxy, a halogen or an alkoxy group.<br>
In addition to these substantially hydrophilic coupling agents, it is also possible to use<br>
hydrophilic silanes, especially the aryl-, alkyl- and fluoroalkyl- substituted di- and trimethoxysilanes. These include, for example, phenethyltrimethoxysilane, propyltrimethoxysilane, butyltrimethoxysilane, isobutyltrimethoxysilane, hexyltrimethoxysilane, octyltrimethoxysilane, IH, IH, 2H, 2H-perfluorodecyltrimethoxysilane and (3,3,3-trifluoropropyl)methyldimethoxysilane. The concentration of coupling agents may be 0.2-1.2% by weight with respect to the base pigment.<br>
In one embodiment, the substrate is platelet-like and may have a mean thickness of about 0.05 to about 1.5 um and a mean width of about 1 to about 750 urn. The substrate may have a mean width of about 10 to about 60 urn, about 5 to about 25 um, about 10 to about 100 um, about 40 to about 250 um, or about 95 to about 730 um.<br>
As an example, when a relatively thin FeOOH coating on an iridescent blue TiC&gt;2 coated laminar substrate (such as SunPearl Iridescent Blue by SunChemical) is reduced by hydrogenation, a semi-opaque lustrous blue-green or turquoise pearlescent pigment results (see Example 26). However, using this same iridescent blue substrate a thicker FeOOH coating will result in a lustrous green or olive pearlescent shade with increased opacity when reduced using similar hydrogenation conditions (see Example 27). This color advancement trend is applicable to many shades of TiO2 coated laminar substrates. Therefore, more opaque blue pearlescent shades may be produced by reduction of iridescent violet TiO2 coated substrates (such as SunPearl Iridescent Violet by SunChemical) containing thick FeOOH coatings (see Example 23). Likewise, less opaque green shades may be produced by reduction of iridescent green TiO2 coated substrates (such as SunPearl Iridescent Green by SunChemical) having relatively thin FeOOH surface layers (see Example 8).<br>
The synthesis of a particular colored pearlescent pigment begins with selection of the proper substrate material. The substrate may be comprised of natural mica, synthetic mica, glass flakes, AI2O3 platelets, Si02 platelets, BiOCl, borosilicate, synthetic alumina, and boron nitride. Such substrates may be multilayer materials, i.e. include materials of different refractive indices. The substrate may comprise mica. The pearlescent pigment may comprise a mixture of different substrates. Furthermore, the substrate maybe made of identical or different flakes which differ in particle size.<br>
The first step in forming a colored pearlescent pigment is to coat the substrate, or metal oxide coated substrate with a layer of non-annealed FeOOH, which is usually pale yellow in color. For the reasons of decreased crystallinity and higher surface area (porous micro structure), non-annealed FeOOH may be reduced to an iron oxide (FeO, FeO-Fe203, Fe304) under more mild reaction conditions, as compared to the more crystalline Fe203. The methods of deposition (or precipitation) of FeOOH or Fe(OH)3 onto substrates are well known in the literature, for example as shown in Dyes and Pigments, 58 (2003), 239-244, US3926659, and in many scientific papers and patents particularly by Merck, Engelhard, and BASF. It is possible to start from a pre-coated substrate and coat this substrate with a metal oxide. Alternatively, the process may start from the substrate itself and a single coating may be used to reach the correct amount of iron oxide. Metal oxides other than FeOOH may used to the coat the substrate, or metal oxide coated substrate.<br>
The basic principle of deposition is as follows: Fe3+ precursors such as ferric chloride,<br>
ferric sulfate, or both, are dissolved in an acidic medium containing the substrate. As the pH is increased by the addition of bases such KOH, NaOH, LiOH, and ammonia; Fe3+ ions are precipitated out as either colloidal FeOOH particles, or dense aggregates depending on the pH control profile, temperature and concentration, and in some case the presence of electrical field. In the presence of substrates with affinity to FeOOH, the colloidal particles can quickly form a uniform film on the substrate. The bonding between the deposited layer and substrate is usually a combination of metal oxide covalent bonds and hydrogen bonds. For example, in the case of making an antique burgundy pearlescent pigment, the substrate is hematite (red calcined Fe203) coated mica, which has extremely good affinity to FeOOH.<br>
The traditional precipitation process utilizing KOH and NaOH is called a heterogeneous hydrolysis process. However, more recently, a newer process called homogenous hydrolysis, utilizes urea as an in situ generated base. This process is said to produce a smoother and more transparent metal oxide film as shown in Dyes and Pigments 58 (2003) 239-244, and Materials Research Bulletin (1999), vol. 34, no. 6, 905-914. The use of ferric sulfate may produce coarser particles, and weaker luster than ferric chloride. A computer-programmed rate-control heater may be used to better control the decomposition rate of urea, which in turn controls the rate of ammonia (base) generation. When the base generation rate is zero order (i.e., constant), the FeOOH colloids will nucleate and grow at a constant rate, and precipitate onto the substrate at a constant rate as well. As a result, a highly uniform film can be generated. At 80°C-90°C, the urea hydrolysis is nearly zero order. This temperature range may be useful as the plateau (holding) temperature of the process. The amount of urea used is just enough to bring the final hydrolyzed solution pH to be between 6 and 8, in order to minimize the amount of free Fe3+ precursor left in the solution. Fe3+ is known to be at its lowest solubility around pH 8.<br>
Depositing FeOOH by the Fe(III)-urea homogeneous hydrolysis may lead to uniform layers of FeOOH on the surface of the titanium dioxide coated mica substrates, which results in neon shaded pearlescent pigments (neon green-gold, neon pink, neon silver gold, etc.) that are not currently available commercially.<br>
After deposition of a thin layer of FeOOH onto the colored substrate, the pigments are recovered from the solution by filtration. The pigments are washed multiple times with de ionized water to remove residual urea, followed by drying to remove residual moisture. Following sufficient drying, the dry pigments are ready for reduction. Hydrogenation may be used to reduce the FeOOH layer. The resultant iron oxide (FeO, FeO-Fe203, Fe304) layer is typically darker in color, depending on the degree of reduction, thickness of the layer, and any other layers. Generally speaking, the more aggressive the hydrogenation conditions or the thicker the layer, the darker the final pigment will be. However, an overly thick iron oxide (FeO, FeO-Fe2O3, Fe3O4) layer will lead to some loss of transparency and luster. The reduction is performed so that the iron of the iron oxide typically comprises from about 1% to about 30% Fe(II) and from about 70% to about 99% Fe(III). The reduction may be performed so that the iron of the iron oxide comprises from about 12% to about 18% Fe(Il) and from about 82% to about 88%o Fe(III). The reduction may be performed so that the iron of the iron oxide comprises from about 14% to about 16% Fe(II) and from about 84% to about 86% Fe(III). In one embodiment, the amount of iron, in the iron oxide, is about 1% to about<br>
15% of the weight of the pearlescent pigment.<br>
Other metal oxides maybe reduced by this procedure. The reduction may be performed so that about 1% to about 30% of the metal in the metal oxide has been reduced. The reduction may be performed so that about 12% to about 18% of the metal in the metal oxide has been reduced. The reduction may be performed so that about 14% to about 16% of the metal in the metal oxide has been reduced. In one embodiment, the amount of metal, in the metal oxide, is about 1% to about 15% of the weight of the pearlescent pigment.<br>
Homogeneous hydrogenation of suspensions containing metal oxide coated mica- based pigments allows much greater control of the oxidation state of the deposited iron oxide layers, compared to conventional high temperature calcination in a reducing (H2ZN2) atmosphere. Thus, this processing technique may allow more precise control over pigment color and luster. In addition, the two step process of metal oxide deposition followed by liquid phase hydrogenation may yield pearlescent pigments with a smooth texture and improVed rub-resistance relative to existing methodologies (e.g. mixtures, etc.). An example of the metal oxide that may be reduced is FeOOH.<br>
One method of reduction uses a liquid-phase hydrogenation set-up consisting of three main components: 1) the hydrogen reservoir (equipped with N2 purging); 2) a pressurized reaction chamber (with a 45° pitch agitation blade and an electrical heating mantle); and 3) a blow-out collector reservoir in case of over-pressure situation. The system is fully enclosed to minimize the risk of gas explosion. The pigments are first dispersed in a non-oxidizing (or mildly reductive) liquid, which has a reasonable H2 gas solubility. Generally speaking, the higher the gas pressure, the higher the H2 concentration in the carrying medium, and therefore the faster the reduction reaction. Higher temperatures and the addition of a noble metal catalyst also speed up the reaction. The degree of reduction, or the lightness (or darkness) of the final pigment are most effectively controlled by the length of reduction time and catalyst loading.<br>
Some examples of solvents are PEG 400 (polyethylene glycol of molecular weight 425g/mol) and NMP (N-methyl pyrrolidone). Other solvents or liquids such as ethylene glycol, PEG 200, dimefhylformamide and water can also be used. PEG 400 is most favored due to its high chemical stability (i.e., reusable for many runs), high boiling point (i.e., enabling high temperature reduction), low vapor pressure, low flammability, high H2 solubility, good wetting power to the pigment (i.e., excellent dispersion and maximum surface exposure to H2), good wetting power to the catalyst (i.e., maximize catalytic surface), and moderate viscosity (45 cP) for the ease of processing, which should be high enough to keep mica pigments from settling even under gentle agitation, and low enough to be filtered out under mild vacuum filtration condition. NMP may also be used. The hydrogenation pressure may be from atmospheric pressure, or above atmospheric pressure to about 70 bar. The pressure may be from about 10 bar to about 40 bar, or from about 10 to about 25 bar. The temperature may be from room temperature to about 220°C, or from 200 - 220 °C, below the degradation temperature of the solvents. The agitation is usually kept below about 300 RPM to avoid fragmenting the pigment. The mica based pigments are usually very fragile and can break under high shear. Fragmentation usually leads to the rise of opacity and loss of luster. The concentration of the catalyst may be about 0.001 to about 0.2 g of catalyst per kilogram of liquid medium. In one embodiment the concentration of the catalyst may be about .01<br>
to about 0.08 g of catalyst per kilogram of liquid medium.<br>
Examples of noble metal catalysts include, but are not limited to Pd, Pt, Pt02 (Adam's catalyst), Rh, Au, Ag, and Ta. The catalyst may be oxides, hydroxides or other derivatives of noble metals. The catalyst can come in supported or unsupported forms. Examples of supported forms include, but are not limited to Pd and Pt metals deposited onto charcoal or carbon based supports (coconut shell, etc.), alumina, zeolite or other inorganic substrates (support). The size of support can range from several millimeters to as small as 10-20 microns. Due to the higher surface to volume ratio, catalysts on smaller support can have a higher metal loading and thus higher catalytic activity. However, due to the size and density similarity to interference pigments, (i.e., 25-75 micron, SG of 3-5), catalysts of small support can be difficult to separate from the pigment, recover and reuse. The use of supported catalysts the size of about 1 mm and above, can be easily separated from pearlescent pigments by dry sieving using sieves of 80-120 mesh size. The large-support catalysts, including but not limited to Escat® 3mm (Pt on alumina) are easily separated; they have relative low efficiency, and thus are useful for shallower hydrogenation that produces lighter color antique pearls such as antique copper and antique bronze.<br>
Nano particulate metal catalysts are useful for deep hydrogenation to obtain extremely dark color. In one embodiment, commercially obtained bulk PtO2 powder (usually 10-50 micron diameter) is wet milled with PEG400 in an intensive media mill using 0.5mm zirconia media for 8 to 16 hours. The final particle size is submicron (ie., colloidal size), and the PtO2 can suspend in PEG 400 liquid for a couple days without settling. Since the majority of the interference pigment will settle in PEG 400 within an hour or so, sedimentation may be used as a separation process to recover colloidal PtO2 from the pigment slurry. The majority of colloidal Pt02 will remain in supernatant phase to be decanted and reused. Such method provides for an efficient liquid-phase hydrogenation of metal oxide coated mica pigments.<br>
In one embodiment the catalyst nanop articulate has a mean diameter from about 53 to about 55 nm. The median particle size may be about 40 nm.<br>
A colloidal fluid of stabilized metal nanoparticles, such as Pt nanoparticles (Pt- NP) may be used as the catalyst for hydrogenation. Pt-NP catalytic fluid is prepared by a polymer stabilized direct-reduction method. The Pt nanoparticles are of 2-5 nm in size, and are stabilized by polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) polymer. This embodiment offers several benefits over micronized Pt02 catalyst and industrially available hydrogenation catalysts mentioned above. First, it is thought that the extremely large surface area of Pt colloid allows for the use of less catalyst, and much more intimate contact between the catalyst and the substrate. Secondly, a small particle size and the presence of a lubricating polymer (PVP), help reduce the friction between the substrate and catalyst, which may lead to better preservation of surface smoothness and luster of the pigment. Third, this catalytic fluid is fhermodynamically stable. The long shelf- life is a big advantage over the micronized PtOi catalyst, which requires periodically re-milling to sustain catalytic efficiency.<br>
After hydrogenation, the pigment is subjected to an optional washing step to remove the Pt residue. PVP, a known chelating agent to Pt and a reducing agent to platinum salt, is useful as a 10% PVP aqueous washing solution to remove the free Pt-NP in the<br>
supernatant, Pt-NP absorbed onto substrate and any trace of Pt ions that might be present.<br>
The deposition of FeOOH followed by hydrogenation may be utilized to progress the interference color associated with pearlescent, TiO2 coated, mica-based pigments.<br>
Transparent, pearlescent TiO2 coated pigments may be transformed into lustrous colored pearlescent pigments using the described methodology. For relatively thin FeOOH deposition, hydrogenation results in pigments characterized by the same interference color with increased opacity. The interference color may be progressed to the next shade (for instance, from violet to blue or blue to green) through reduction of relatively thick FeOOH coatings. This process also significantly increases the opacity of the resulting pearlescent pigment. Thus, various vibrant, multi-colored pigments may be produced in all four quadrants of the CIELAB color space with controlled opacity allowing for significantly improved formulation flexibility.<br>
In one embodiment of a black/antique pearlescent pigment, the synthesis starts with choosing an appropriate substrate. The choice of substrate affects the undertone and transparency of color of the black/antique pearl interference pigment. For example, to yield an antique burgundy look, it is important to choose a substrate with deep red or deep maroon color, such as hematite (i.e., high temperature calcined Fe203) coated mica. This undertone in combination with an iron oxide (FeO, FeO-Fe203, Fe304) top layer will produce various shades of burgundy colors. Fe203 or TiO2 coated synthetic or natural mica has colors ranging from red to yellow and blue to green. The color of substrate dictates the undertone of final pearl appearance. It is also desirable to choose a substrate with high transparency so that it can faithfully emulate the "airy" look of high quality natural pearl. Generally speaking synthetic mica (such those made by CQV), glass flakes layer (for instance from Nippon Sheet glass), borosilicate and synthetic alumina substrates are preferred over natural mica for higher transparency. Such substrates may be multilayer materials i.e. include materials of different refractive indices.<br>
In one embodiment the pearlescent pigment is an inorganic material, and the color of a homogeneous coating of the pigment, measured over a white background, is selected from the group consisting of: a CIELAB hue angle, hab, from about 50 to about 80 degrees, wherein L* is not more than about 85, and the chroma value is greater than 22; a CIELAB hue angle, hab, from about 80 to about 275 degrees,<br>
wherein L* is not more than about 80, and the chroma value is greater than about 10; and a CIELAB hue angle, hab, from not less than about 275 to not more than about 50 degrees, wherein L* is not more than about 85, and the chroma value is greater than about 9.<br>
In one embodiment the pearlescent pigment is an inorganic material, and the color of a homogeneous coating of the pigment, measured over a white background has a CIELAB hue angle, hab, from about 50 to about 80 degrees, wherein L* is not more than about 85, and the chroma value is greater than 22. The L* may be not more than about 80, about 75, or about 70. The chroma value may be greater than about 24, about 26, or about 28. In one embodiment the CIELAB hue angle, hab, is from about 50 to about 65 degrees.<br>
In one embodiment the pearlescent pigment is an inorganic material, and the color of a homogeneous coating of the pigment, measured over a white background has a CIELAB hue angle, hab, from about 80 to about 275 degrees, wherein L* is not more than about 80, and the chroma value is greater than about 10. The L* may be not more than about 75, about 70, or about 65. The chroma value may be greater than about 12, about 14, or about 16.<br>
In one embodiment the pearlescent pigment is an inorganic material, and the color of a homogeneous coating of the pigment, measured over a white background has a CIELAB hue angle, hab, from not less than about 275 to not more than about 50 degrees, wherein L* is not more than about 85, and the chroma value is greater than about 9. The L* may be not more than about 80, about 75, or about 70. The chroma value may be greater than about 11, about 13, or about 15.<br>
In one embodiment the pearlescent pigment is blue, with a CIELAB hue angle, hab, from about 170 to about 275 degrees, measured over a white background using a D65 illuminant and a 10 degree observer. Blue pearlescent pigments may be produced that do not contain iron blue (ferric ferrocyanide), allowing the pigment to be used in cosmetic applications involving the lip area, such as lip gloss, lipstick, and other lip formulations. In addition, the blue pearlescent pigments are more stable than ferric ferrocyanide, which decomposes in alkaline pH resulting in pigment bleeding and marked changes in pigment color. Another advantage of the blue pearlescent pigments is that they do not restrict the pigment to the color space defined by ferric ferrocyanide. Iron Blue is a powerful colorant that only allows the pigment designer to formulate pigments within a well defined, narrow color space and restricts formulation flexibility, see Dyes and Pigments 56 (2003) 93 - 98.<br>
In one embodiment the pearlescent pigment is green, with a CIELAB hue angle, hab, from about 80 to about 170 degrees, measured over a white background using a D65 illuminant and a 10 degree observer. Green pearlescent pigments may be produced that do not contain chromium oxide, allowing the pigment to be used in cosmetic applications involving the lip area, such as lip gloss, lipstick, and other lip formulations. Most commercially available green pearlescent pigments are based on chromium oxide deposition, US 6485556.<br>
In one embodiment the pearlescent pigment is red, pink, or violet, with a CIELAB hue angle, hah, from not less than about 275 to not more than about 50 degrees, measured over a white background using a D65 illuminant and a 10 degree observer. Red, pink, or violet mica-based pearlescent pigments may be produced that do not contain carmine. Carmine is a colorant used extensively in the cosmetic industry either directly or combined with pearlescent pigments (such as in Cloisonne® Red by Engelhard/BASF). It is extremely sensitive to UV exposure and may fade over time. Carmine is also unstable in acidic environments. It is often characterized by colorant bleeding in cosmetic formulations, such as nail polish. In addition, carmine (which is extracted from insects) has been linked to numerous reports of allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis. The development of carmine-free red, pink and violet shades is particularly advantageous because it offers formulators a more stable and hygienic alternative. In one embodiment the pearlescent pigment does not contain carmine.<br>
In another embodiment, the pearlescent pigment has a HPI of less than about 1 when<br>
measured in a 76 (am thick film formed from 10 wt % of the pigment in acrylic enamel. The HPI may be less than about 0.5. The HPI may range from about 0.05 to about 0.5.<br>
There are relatively few dark colored (or antique-looking) pearlescent pigments currently offered in the market, examples of such are; Timica® and Cloisonne Nu-Antique® lines by Engelhard/BASF. The existing dark pearlescent products in the market are too opaque and too dull (i.e., not enough luster), and not dark enough to emulate the natural black pearl effect (e.g., Tahiti black pearl). In addition, they exhibit an undesirable darkening effect when applied and rubbed on the skin. One method to solve these problems is to use a dark colored layer on top or beneath the interference layer as a smooth film, to minimize light scattering, and thus preserve the luster and transparency of the pigment.<br>
In one embodiment the pearlescent pigment is an inorganic material and the color of a homogeneous coating of the pigment, measured over a white background, has a CIELAB L* value of about 30 or less and a chroma value of about 3 or less. The L* may be not more than about 28, about 25, or about 22. The chroma value may be less than about 2.5, about 2, or about 1.5. These methods have been used to produce very dark antique/black pearl interference pigments. The darkest color achieved based on a 5% pigment drawdown in a nitrocellulose varnish is in the range of about 29 to about 32 in terms of lightness value (L* value in CIE1976 color space, measured using a 10 degree observer, illuminant D65 with Specular Component Included), which is very close to the reference LENETA card black (L*=28) along with a very low chroma (typically less than 3). Titan® ST is the range of L*=64 to 65, Engelhard's Cloisonne NU- Antique Series is in the range of L*=37 to 60. In all cases, these are much lighter and less lustrous than the pigment formed by this process.<br>
The methods described may produce pigments with better hiding power while maintaining a high luster. The pigments may have better stability than current pigments at high and low pH, and are less likely to bleed.<br>
In one embodiment the pearlescent pigment is an inorganic material and the 8E* of the alkaline stability for a homogeneous coating of the pigment, measured over a white background, is less than about 2.<br>
In one embodiment the pearlescent pigment is an inorganic material and the 8E* of the acid stability for a homogeneous coating of the pigment, measured over a white background, is less than about 4.<br>
In one embodiment the pearlescent pigment is an inorganic material and the 8E* of magnetically aligned and non-aligned homogeneous coatings of the pigment, measured over a white background, is not less than 20.<br>
In one embodiment the pearlescent pigment has a magnetic susceptibility of about 0.1 x 10"5to7.5xl0"5m3/kg.<br>
The pigments may be magnetic or exhibit magnetic susceptibility. In fluid-based systems, such as liquid coatings or uncured plastic preparations containing these pigments, an applied magnetic field may be used to align pigments in specific regions of the coating to create images that appear to be three-dimensional. After the pigments have<br>
been aligned, the coating may be cured to solidify the image.<br>
The three-dimensional effect is produced by the pigment particles aligned at non-parallel or intermediate angles with respect to the coating surface. In an applied electric field, the high aspect ratio platelets will align themselves such that the longest dimension of the platelet (namely, the platelet width) aligns itself along the magnetic field lines. The ability to reorient the colored particles allows them to be manipulated to specific angles resulting in a controlled three-dimensional appearance. In regions of where the field lines are perpendicular to the observer, the platelet particles will be perpendicular to the observer resulting in a jet black appearance. This extremely dark appearance is due to light scattering at the particle edges and the absence of a reflective surface. In regions devoid of an applied magnetic force, the particles align more substantially parallel to the applied coating surface resulting in the intensely colored appearance. Appling a magnetic field parallel to the coating surface will orient more of the pigments parallel to the surface resulting in a even more intensely colored appearance.<br>
In one embodiment a cosmetic composition contains the pearlescent pigment. The cosmetic composition may be useful for make-up products for the skin, the eyes, or hair. Examples of compositions intended as make-up for the skin include eye shadows, eye liners, mascaras, body or face powder, foundations, blushes, colored creams, nail polish, lipsticks, lip gloss, hair or body gel, hair or body wash, cover sticks, lotion, concealer and foundation. Examples of cosmetic applications involving the lip area, are lip gloss, lipstick, and other lip compositions. Nail polish may be referred to as nail varnish, or nail enamel.<br>
Pearlescent pigments may be used to produce a makeup cosmetic as described in US6663852, US6451294, and 6280714.<br>
In one embodiment, the pigments of the composition are aligned during or after application of the composition. An example of aligning the pigments of the composition is by applied the composition with a magnetic applicator. The magnetic applicator may be used to align the magnetic particles in the cosmetic allowing control of their appearance.<br>
General cosmetic compositions may contain preservatives, stabilizers, neutralizing agents, aqueous-phase thickeners (polysaccharide biopolymers, synthetic polymers) or fatty-phase thickeners, such as clay minerals, fillers, perfumes, hydrophilic or lipophilic active substances, surfactants, antioxidants, film-forming polymers and mixtures thereof. The amounts of these various ingredients are those conventionally employed in the fields in question and, for example, may be from 0.01 to 30% of the total weight of the composition. In one embodiment, the cosmetic composition may further comprise a binder wherein the pigment represents about 0.5% to about 99.5% of the composition.<br>
Lip cosmetic composition may comprise any ingredient usually used in the field concerned, such as water, preferably in an amount ranging from 0 to 95% of the total weight of the composition, water-soluble or liposoluble dyes, antioxidants, essential oils, preserving agents, fragrances, neutralizing agents, liposoluble polymers, in particular hydrocarbon-based polymers such as polyalkylenes or polyvinyl laurate, gelling agents for an aqueous phase, gelling agents for a liquid fatty phase, waxes, gums, surfactants, additional cosmetic or dermatological active agents such as, for example, emollients,<br>
moisturizers (for example glycerol), vitamins, liquid lanolin, essential fatty acids, lipophilic or hydrophilic sunscreens, and mixtures thereof. The composition may also contain lipid vesicles of ionic and/or nonionic type. These ingredients (other than the water) may be present in the composition in a proportion of from 0 to 20% of the total weight of the composition.<br>
In one embodiment a coating or ink composition contains the pearlescent pigment. In another embodiment an article comprises the pearlescent pigment. A coating, ink, or article may further comprise a binder, wherein the pigment represents about 0.5% to about 99.5% of the composition, about 0.1% to about 70%, or about 0.2% to about 10%.<br>
The coating or ink may be printing ink, surface coating, coatings for laser marking, pigment preparation, dry preparation, food colorant, textile coating, architectural coating, synthetic fiber, or fiber based product. A coating may be applied to an object as a liquid, vapor, or solid. Examples of methods for applying a coating are by printing, painting, polymeric coating, or spraying. The coating may be a powder, enamel, aerosol, paint, epoxy, or polymer.<br>
The ink may be a magnetic toner. An example of a magnetic toner is one that is used for Magnetic Ink Character Recognition (MICR). These toners may be used to print security codes on checks and are read by low-cost readers. Many of the toners used for MICR are black. The color and magnetic susceptibility of the MICR ink may be adjusted by using different pearlescent pigments.<br>
The arts of making coatings and inks, as well the various printing processes (i.e., intaglio, flexo, screen, offset, gravure) are very well known in the literatures, so it is not repeated here [see "The Printing Ink Manual", 5th edition, R.H. Leach, ed. Taylor &amp; Francis, Inc.]. Other less common printing processes include digital offset solutions such as the Hewlett-Packard Indigo presses.<br>
Besides the topical applications such as printings or coatings, the pigments can be incorporated directly into substrates during the formation stage to make an article. For example, to a papers, the pigments can be introduced along with other regular paper fillers such as calcite, talc during paper making to fill the open pores of paper near the surface. If the article is a plastic, the pigment can be introduced during the extrusion of substrate. Examples of articles are plastic, glass, ceramic material, concrete, pressed wood, pills, paper, toothpaste, food products, or agricultural products.<br>
The terms goniochromatic, iridescent, and pearlescent, may be used interchangeably to mean a change of color depending on the viewing angle.<br>
Unless otherwise specified, the alkaline stability of a pigment is measured as 5E* measured against a white background, using the procedure described in Example 32.<br>
Unless otherwise specified, the acid stability of a pigment is measured as 5E* measured against a white background, using the procedure described in Example 33.<br>
Unless otherwise specified, the HPI, CIELAB coordinates, hue angle, hab, L*, a*, b*, and chroma of a pigment are measured using the pigment drawdown described in Example 32 with a white or black background using a D65 illuminant and a 10 degree<br>
observer.<br>
A homogeneous coating of a pigment is a coating that only contains one colored element, it is not a blend of colored elements. An example of a pigment that will not form a homogeneous coating is Cloisonne® Nu Antique Gold pigment, the pigment contains both color pigment and iron oxide.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Example 1; FeCU-Urea Homogenous Hydrolysis Process for Depositing an Easily Reducible FeOOH Layer<br>
•	A 0.1M HC1 solution (356.9g) was added to a 500 ml cylindrical reaction vessel blade (for gentle stirring and non-sticking property). The solution was stirred at 175 RPM. A 7.1g 45%wt FeCl3 Stock Solution (Riedel 12322, 45%wt FeCl3, 55% water) was add drop-wise into the reactor.<br>
•	Urea (16g) was added slowly into reactor under agitation.<br>
•	Sky Chemical Russet Pigment (20g) was added to the reactor, and stirred for 5 minutes.<br>

Other platelet-like substrates may be used including those comprising synthetic mica (uncoated or metal oxide coated) or flaky glass supports. These substrates may contain multiple adsorbed layers, such as those that contain materials of varying refractive index. It is important to note that equivalent levels of Fe uptake (g Fe/g mica) can be achieved using both pre-coated or uncoated supports by either re-deposition or by adjustment of the reaction conditions.<br>

The colorimetric parameters (CIE L*a*b*) of the dried films were measured using a 10<br>
degree observer and D65 illuminant (specular component included and specular component excluded) against both a white and black reference background. The results of these measurements are listed in the tables below.<br>

Example 6 - Neon Green-Gold Pearlescent Pigment<br>
A mixture of HC1 (706.2 g of 0.1 M solution), FeCl3 (14.2 g of 45 wt% solution), urea (96 g), and TiO2 coated natural mica pigment (40 g, SunPearl Iridescent Green, 10-60 urn particle size) was charged into a IL jacketed pot reactor under agitation at 180 rpm. The mixture had a pH of approximately 1.8. The mixture was then heated to 9O0C. The pigment is complete when urea decomposition resulted in a rise of the solution pH to between about 6.3 and 6.5. After about 2 hours at 9O0C, the pigment was filtered, rinsed with deionized water, and dried at 60 - 80 °C. A neon-like lustrous pigment having a green interference color combined with a golden yellow absorbance color was obtained. The resulting pigment contained approximately 6.5 wt% elemental iron as measured using a Perkin Elmer 5100 PC Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer. CIELAB values measured for this pigment and the starting substrate with a Spectraflash SF600 Plus spectrophotometer are listed in Table 5.<br>
Example 7 - Neon Gold Pearlescent Pigment<br>
A neon gold pearlescent pigments was prepared via the same technique demonstrated in Example 1, except the amount of each reagent initially charged to the reaction vessel is different as depicted in Table 6. As shown in Table 6, the amount of FeCl3 used for coating was twice that used in Example 1 with the same Urea/Fe molar ratio of 40.6 and the same starting substrate. Following filtration, washing, and drying, a neon-like lustrous pigment having a golden interference color was obtained (see Table 5 for CIELAB values). The resulting pigment contained approximately 10.7 wt% elemental iron.<br>
This example illustrates thicker coatings of FeOOH layers on Ti62-coated platelet-like substrates can be utilized to progress the interference color to the next shade. This is evident by comparison of the hue angle measured over a black background (see Table 5) for the coated substrates and the starting material. The uncoated substrate has a green interference color with a hue angle of 205.1. FeOOH coating progresses the hue angle clockwise with increasing thickness. As shown for a reaction Fe/pigment mass ratio of 0.055 (or 6.5 wt% Fe in the final pigment), the hue angle progresses from a green interference color (hue angle = 205.1) to a green-gold interference color (hue angle = 108.6). At about double the reaction Fe/pigment mass ratio (which results in 10.7 wt% Fe in the final pigment), the hue angle further progresses to a more golden interference color (hue angle = 83.0).<br>
Increased FeOOH deposition results in a darkening of the substrate, or a drop in the L* value, as shown in Table 5. The L* value of the starting material with both white and black backgrounds is reduced as the Fe/pigment mass ratio used in deposition is increased.<br>

Example 8 - Lustrous, Semi-Opaque Green Pearlescent Pigment<br>
[0093]    The pigment prepared in Example 6 (20 g, Mica + TiO2 + Fe(OH)3, particle size of 10 - 60 ftm) and PVP stabilized Pt catalyst (4 g) in ethylene glycol (prepared in Example 3) were dispersed in polyethylene glycol 400 (96 g, PEG 400, EMD Chemical, CAS 25322-68-3), and added to a 600 mL steel Parr reactor equipped with twin 45 degree pitch blade impellers. The mixture was agitated at approximately 800 rpm. The reaction solution was purged several times by pressurizing the vessel with nitrogen and then evacuating under vacuum. Following sufficient purging, the mixture was heated to 220 °C, pressurized with hydrogen to 10.3 bar and held at these conditions for 6 hours. The pigment was filtered, rinsed with 4 L deionized water followed by 1 L ethanol, and dried at 60 - 80 °C. A deep and intensely colored, semi-opaque, green pearlescent pigment (see Table 7 for corresponding CIE Lab color values) was obtained.<br>
[0094]     The weight fraction of Fe(IT) and Fe(III) in the final pigment is given in Table 8. Total iron and Fe(ll) content was determined via atomic absorption spectroscopy and oxidation/reduction titration with 0.1 N potassium dichromate, respectively. The hydrogenation resulted in reduction of approximately 15.4% of the deposited iron (Fe(in) to Fe(II)).<br>
[0095]     As shown in Table 7, this reduction process transformed the bichroic starting material (Example 6) into a more opaque pigment with more uniform color coordinates as measured with white and black backgrounds. The level of opacity, or hiding power can be described using a hiding power index (HPI) defined as:<br><br>
[0096]    where L*(black) and L*(white) are the measured lightness or L* value on a black and white background, respectively. Full opacity is obtained when L*(black) is equivalent to L*(white) causing the hiding power index to equate to infinity. The HPI associated with this pigment is listed in Table 7.<br><br>

Example 9 - Lustrous. Opaque Gold Pearlescent Pigment<br>
An intensely colored, gold pearlescent pigments with increased opacity relative to Example 8, was prepared according to the procedure for Example 8 except that the Fe/Pigment mass ratio used in deposition was increased by two-fold resulting in higher weight fraction of Fe in the final pigment (see Tables 7 and 8). As shown by the CIELAB values listed in Table 7, a vibrantly colored gold pearlescent pigment was obtained following hydrogenation. The resulting pigment has higher opacity, or higher hiding power index relative to Example 8 (50.0 compared to 1.56 for Example 3) as shown in Table 7.<br>
The progression of the interference color of TiO2-coated platelet like substrates and the opacity may be precisely controlled by the Fe/pigment mass ratio. As will be shown in the following examples, the two-step process (coating and reduction) may be applied to TiO2 coated mica pigments with various interference colors such as: gold, red, violet, blue, green, and silver. An infinite number of lustrous, colored pearlescent pigments that span all four quadrants of the CIELAB color coordinate system may be produced while controlling the opacity to suit the intended application.<br>
The color and opacity is directly controlled by the thickness of both the initial TiO2 and the deposited FeOOH layers. For semi-opaque shades (as described in Example 8), the reduction of thin FeOOH layers result in pigments characterized by a simple progression of the initial interference color or hue angle as shown in Table 7. Reduction of thicker FeOOH layers results in further advancement of the interference color or hue angle and can progress the interference color to the next shade (in the case of Example 5, from green to yellow) while increasing the opacity or HPI.<br>
Examples 10 through 13 - Development of Lustrous, Pearlescent Pigments Using TiOr-<br>
Coated Mica with a Gold Interference Color<br>
The methods described above may be applied to TiO2-coated mica substrates characterized by a yellow or gold interference color. Examples 10 and 11 are analogous to 6 and 7, except that that the substrate material used was SunPearl Iridescent Gold (10 - 60 urn) rather than SunPearl Iridescent Green. The composition of the reaction solution for both Example 10 and 11 is shown in Table 6 with the CIELAB values of the resulting pigments given in Table 9.<br>
As shown previously, FeOOH deposition results in clockwise advancement of the hue 'angle (over a black background) of the starting substrate (see Table 9). The initial gold interference color (hue angle = 93.4) is advanced to orange gold (Example 6, hue angle = 68.6) at low Fe loading and further to pink (hue angle = 24.2) at increased FeOOH layer thickness. Following deposition, these pigments are goniochromatic, or characterized by a specific interference color (in this case, orange, gold, or pink) at some viewing angles, with a gold to yellow absorbance color at others. The gold to yellow absorbance color is due to the precipitated yellow iron oxide or FeOOH layer. As the FeOOH thickness increases, the darkness of the coated pigment increases as shown by the measured L* values depicted in Table 9.<br>
The reduction of Examples 10 and 11 by the hydro genation method described in Example 8, yielded Examples 12 and 13, respectively. Example 12 is a lustrous semi-opaque, orange pigment with a HPI of 0.267. Due to the relatively thin FeOOH layer, reduction resulted in a small advancement of the hue angle, shifting the interference color from gold to orange. Although the conditions for reduction between Examples 12 and 13 were equivalent, Example 13 yields a more opaque (HPI = 1.099), darker, lustrous plum pigment. The larger color shift, from a hue angle of 49.2 (Example 12 on a black background) to 354.7 (Example 13 on a black background), and the increase in opacity is due to the increased thickness of the coated FeOOH layer.<br>

Example 9 - Lustrous. Opaque Gold Pearlescent Pigment<br>
[0097]    An intensely colored, gold pearlescent pigments with increased opacity relative to Example 8, was prepared according to the procedure for Example 8 except that the Fe/Pigment mass ratio used in deposition was increased by two-fold resulting in higher weight fraction of Fe in the final pigment (see Tables 7 and 8). As shown by the CIELAB values listed in Table 7, a vibrantly colored gold pearlescent pigment was obtained following hydrogenation. The resulting pigment has higher opacity, or higher hiding power index relative to Example 8 (50.0 compared to 1.56 for Example 3) as shown in Table 7.<br>
[0098]    The progression of the interference color of TiO2-coated platelet like substrates and the opacity may be precisely controlled by the Fe/pigment mass ratio. As will be shown in the following examples, the two-step process (coating and reduction) may be applied to TiO2 coated mica pigments with various interference colors such as: gold, red, violet, blue, green, and silver. An infinite number of lustrous, colored pearlescent pigments that span all four quadrants of the CTELAB color coordinate system may be produced while controlling the opacity to suit the intended application.<br>
[0099]     The color and opacity is directly controlled by the thickness of both the initial T1O2 and the deposited FeOOH layers. For semi-opaque shades (as described in Example 8), the reduction of thin FeOOH layers result in pigments characterized by a simple progression of the initial interference color or hue angle as shown in Table 7. Reduction of thicker FeOOH layers results in further advancement of the interference<br>

Examples 14 through 19 - Development of Lustrous, Pearlescent Pigments Using TiOr-<br>
Coated Mica with a Red Interference Color<br>
Examples 14 through 19 were prepared according to the procedure described in Example 6, except that the TiCVcoated mica substrates (SunPearl Iridescent Red, 10-60 um) were characterized by a pink to red interference color. The reaction Fe/Pigment mass ratios used are indicated in Table 6. The CIELAB values for each pigment prepared are shown in Table 10.<br>
For clarity, the a* and b* coordinates of Examples 14-16 measured against a black background are plotted in Figure 1. Pigment drawdowns (3 mil Bird applicator) of Examples 14-16 were prepared by dispersing 0.75 g pigment in 5 g of vehicle (10% CAB 531-1 (Eastman Chemical) in n-butyl acetate). Figure 1 shows that deposition at very low Fe/pigment ratios, in particular for Fe/pigment ratios less than about 0.055, results in an initial increase in the b* coordinate with small impact on the a* value. This is perhaps due to the characteristic yellow absorbance of FeOOH. It is from this point, point 2 in Figure 1, that the clockwise shift in hue angle begins at increasing FeOOH layer thickness. As shown, the hue angle begins to progress pass the initial hue angle of the support material at Fe/pigment ratios of about 0.055. For Example 16 (Fe/pigment ratio = 0.055), the interference color is noticeably violet indicating sufficient progression to the next shade (red to violet).<br>
The reduction of Examples 14 - 16 by the hydrogenation method described in Example 8, yielded Examples 17-19, respectively. As shown by the CIELAB values depicted in Table 10, reduction yields lustrous, pearlescent pigments ranging from pink to light violet, and the hiding power index, or HPI, associated with these pigments increased with increasing Fe/pigment mass ratio.<br>

The pigments of Examples 20 and 21 displayed the characteristic clockwise shift in hue angle, resulting in the gradual progression from a violet to blue interference color at increased Fe/pigment ratio. The reduction of Examples 20 and 21, using the conditions described in Example 8, yielded Examples 22 and 23, respectively. As shown in Table 11, the reduction of thin FeOOH surface layers (such as Example 22) yields a semi-opaque pearlescent pigment characterized by a color similar to the interference color of the TiO2-coated mica support. In this case, Example 22 yields a lustrous, dark violet pearlescent pigment. Reduction of thicker FeOOH layers, such as the pigment produced in Example 23, results in an advancement of the interference color to the next shade (in this case from violet to blue) and increased opacity or HPI.<br>

Examples 24 and 25 were prepared according to the procedure described in Example 6, except the TiO2-coated mica substrate had a blue interference color (SunPearl Iridescent Blue, 10-60 um), and used reaction Fe/pigment ratios of 0.055 and 0.110, respectively, as shown in Table 6.

As shown in Table 12, the reduction of thin FeOOH surface layers (such as Example 26) yields a semi-opaque pearlescent pigment characterized by a color similar to the interference color of the TiO2-coated mica support. In this case, Example 26 yields a lustrous, turquoise pearlescent pigment. Reduction of thicker FeOOH layers, such as the pigment produced in Example 27, results in an advancement of the interference color to the next shade (in this case from an iridescent blue to opaque olive green) and increased opacity or HPI.<br>
The examples described above indicate that an almost infinite number of lustrous, vibrant colored pearlescent shades with controlled opacity may be prepared by the methods described herein. The potential color range spans the CIELAB color space.<br>

 [00112]   As shown in Table 14, FeOOH deposition results in a transition from a transparent silver white to golden shades. The deposition of thicker FeOOH layers results in a more golden color and a noticeably darker appearance (lower L* value). The reduction of Examples 28 and 29, using the conditions described in Example 8 yielded Examples 30 and 31, respectively. Example 30 is a lustrous, semi-opaque, champagne-colored pearlescent pigment with a HPI of 0.862. At increased reaction Fe/pigment mass ratio, as used in Example 31, gave a more opaque (HPI = 1.852), metallic grey pearlescent pigment with a darker appearance (lower L* value, see Table 14).<br>

[00114]   A basic solution (pH 12.5, NaOH in distilled water) was mixed with 2 wt% pigment (see Table 15) to prepare suspensions. The suspensions were mixed, and allowed to settle for about 5 hours. The pigments were then filtered, rinsed with deionized water, and dried at 80<br>

[00115]   Pigment drawdowns (3 mil Bird applicator) were prepared by dispersing 0.5 g of each pigment in 4.5 g of vehicle (PPG Delstar DMR499 Acrylic Enamel), followed by applying the mixture to a Leneta Form 2C opacity card. The CIELAB color coordinates (10° observer and D65 illuminant with specular component included) for the treated and untreated samples were measured using a Spectraflash SF600 Plus spectrophotometer at a 90° viewing angle.<br>
The hiding power index (before and after treatment) and color difference or AE* (AE* = ((L*)2+ ( a*)2+ (b*)2)"2) between the treated and untreated samples were measured against a black and white background, see Table 16.<br>

(Table Removed) <br>
[00116]   All the commercially available blue pearlescent pigments tested displayed a marked shift in color and opacity following immersion in alkaline solution. The measured color difference is due to the instability of iron blue in alkaline environment. The absence of iron blue or ferric ferrocyanide in the preparation of blue pearlescent pigments represents a significant advantage in terms of alkaline stability. For the blue pearlescent pigment prepared as described in Example 23, the treated and untreated samples showed a small relative color difference (AE*

[00118]   An acidic solution (pH 1.5 of concentrated HCl in distilled water) was mixed with 2 wt% pigment (see Table 17) to prepare a suspension. The suspensions were mixed, and allowed to settle for about 20 hours. The pigments were filtered, rinsed with deionized water and dried at 80 °C.<br>
[00119]   Drawdown preparation and color analysis was performed as described in the previous example. The hiding power index (before and after treatment) and color difference or AE* between the treated and untreated samples measured against a black and white background is shown in Table 18.<br>
[00120]   As shown in Table 18, the pink pearlescent pigment of Example 18 showed the lowest color difference (or lower AE*) against a white background following exposure to acidic conditions. Only the Cosmica® Red showed lower AE* measured against a black background. This tow value of AE* measured for the Cosmica® Red sample is due to the similarity of its L* value (L* = 27.25) with that of the black background (L* = 27.20) as shown in Table 19. In reality, the Cosmica® Red sample showed significant degradation as is evident by its marked change in color coordinates measured against a white background as depicted in Table 20 (E* = 16.258).<br>

As shown in Figure 2, the pigment prepared by the current invention was the only filtrate sample that showed no significant absorption in the visible region.

[00125]   Table 21 consists of three types of green pearlescent pigments: Mica-TiO2 + Cr2Oi (Cloisonne Green and Blue Green), Mica-TiO2 + Cr2O3 mixed with iron oxide particles (Cloisonne Nu Antique Green) and Example 27. A difference between the pigment of Example 27 and the commercially available green pearlescent pigments shown in Table 21 is the absence of Cr203. Freedom from chromium containing compounds allows for the use of these green pearlescent pigments in more cosmetic compositions, specifically in applications involving the lip area.<br>
[00126]   As shown in Table 22, the color stability in alkaline environments of the green pearlescent pigment (E* = 2.49 over a white background and E* = 1.78 over a black background) described in example 27 is consistent with values observed for the blue pearlescent pigment (E* = 1.71 over a white background and E* = 1.40 over a black background) described in examples 23 and 32.<br>
[00127]   In addition to being chromium-free, the green pearlescent pigments described may be made in both transparent (low HPI) and opaque (high HPI) varieties. TiO2-coated mica pigments containing a layer of Cr2O3 are generally restricted to transparent pearlescent pigments as depicted in Table 22 (HPI = 0.099). On the other hand, Example 27 is much more opaque (HPI = 0.505) than both the Cloisonne Green and Blue Green. This is significant when considering that the particle size distribution for Example 27 is slightly higher (see Table 21) than the Cloisonne' series pigments. This property allows a more<br>
lustrous, green pearlescent pigment with improved hiding power or opacity compared to Cr203 coated mica-based pigments.<br>
[00128]   In order to improve hiding power or opacity, conventional Crz03 coated mica-based pigments can be combined with loose iron oxide particles to create opaque green pearlescent pigments, such as the technique used to prepare Cloisonne Nu Antique Green (see Table 21). As shown in Table 22, this results in a significant increase in hiding power or surface coverage (HPI = 1.351). However, a significant drawback of this approach is the loss of luster due to excess light scattering and the general dirty appearance that results from the presence of these loose nonplatelet-like particles. This approach also results in a significant loss of color stability in liquid preparations (as depicted by the high AE* shown in Table 22) due to separation of the loose iron oxide particles from the Cr203 coated mica-based pigment.<br>

Example 66 – Magnetic Pearlescent Pigment<br>
[00167]   SunPearl Bronze (20g, C84-6281, SunChemical) was reduced as described in Example 8 to form a deep and intensely colored, golden-beige pearlescent pigment (see Table 7 for corresponding CIELAB color values) was obtained. The magnetic susceptibility of the resulting pigment as well as, the starting pigment were measured by Applied Paleomagnetics in Santa Cruz, California using a Bartington MS2 susceptibility meter.<br><br>
(Table Removed) <br>
Example 67 - Particle Alignment of Example 66 using a Magnetic Field [00168]   Pigment drawdowns of the pigment prepared in Example 66 and the starting pigment of SunPearl Bronze were prepared as described in Example 32.<br>
[ooi69]   Four circular button magnets (13 mm ProMAG®, Magnetic Specialty LLC, Neodymium (Grade 35, 12,300 gauss) magnet) were placed on a tray in an oven maintained at 50 °C. After positioning the magnets, a 0.64 cm thick glass plate was placed directly over the magnets. Directly following application of the pigment suspensions, the opacity card is placed on the glass plate so that each circular magnet is located directly beneath the white and black background for both the starting pigment of Example 66 and the pigment prepared in Example 66. The pigment prepared in Example 66 (magnetic susceptibility = 5.056 x 105 m3/kg) instantaneously oriented into a three-dimensional circular pattern with unique depth of perception above both the white and black background. The starting material from Example 66, SunPearl Bronze (magnetic susceptibility = 0.019 x 10"5 nvVkg). displayed no change upon placement above the magnetic field, indicating that the mass susceptibility was<br>
too low to orient the pigment in this magnetic field. After 10 - 15 minutes in the oven, the three-dimensional image was cured and fixed within the coating.<br>
[00170]   The CIELAB values of the coatings were measured as described in Example 32. The aligned pigment, was measured in the center of the circular image formed by the magnet. The central portion of three-dimensional magnetic image appears black (L* ~ 30) over both the white and black backgrounds. The black appearance may be due to the orientation of the platelet-like pigments normal to the surface.  Alignment normal to the surface significantly reduces the area available for reflection resulting in a black appearance. The measured color difference (F.*) between the central portion of the circular image (maximum alignment normal to the coating surface) and the region devoid of the applied magnetic field was 25.9 and 27.2 over white and black respectively, as shown in Table 27.<br><br>

Example 72 - Cosmetic Nail Enamel Use Application<br>
[00178]   The pigment from Example 66 was added at 4 wt% to a nail enamel base (Tevco, Product 871 1) and mixed at 3000 rpm for 3 minutes using a DAC150FVZ-K model (Hauschild Engineering) high speed mixer. The nail enamel was then applied to an opacity card (Leneta Form 3B) using a 3 mil (- 76 micron) Bird applicator.<br>
[00179]   Four circular button magnets (13 mm ProM AG®, Magnetic Specialty LLC) were placed on a tray in an oven maintained at 50 "C. After positioning the magnets, a 0.64 cm thick glass plate was placed directly over the magnets.  Directly following application of the nail enamel, the opacity card is placed on the glass plate such that two circular magnets are located directly beneath both the white and black background.<br>
[00180]    Upon placement of the card, the pigment prepared in Example 66 instantaneously<br>
oriented into a three-dimensional circular pattern with unique depth of perception above both the unite and black background.<br>

[00182]   The drawdown procedure used in Example 67 was applied to the pigments listed in Table 32. The application of the magnetic field to the Cloisonne® Nu Antique Gold pigment did not show the dramatic platelet realignment to create the three-dimensional effect, instead the coating was only darkened. The pigment may be made from magnetic iron oxide particles that are not bound to the platelet substrate. Consequently, application of a magnetic field does not align the platelets to give the three-dimensional effect. The CIELAB values of the other coatings were measured as described in Example 67.<br>
