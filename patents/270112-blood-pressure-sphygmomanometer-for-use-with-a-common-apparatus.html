BLOOD PRESSURE SPHYGMOMANOMETER<br>
FOR USE WITH A COMMON APPARATUS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001] The present invention relates generally to blood pressure<br>
monitoring devices. More specifically, the invention hereof relates to a conventional<br>
prolific device such as a cell phone or computer mouse controller which incorporates<br>
a blood pressure cuff for monitoring blood pressure and displaying measured data<br>
either at the computer with which the mouse is associated, on the cell phone or<br>
computer display to which the wrist cuff is connected, or on a television screen of a<br>
television having a remote control to which the cuff is connected. Such data display<br>
provides an easily understood representation of the measured parameters.<br><br>

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0002] This application claims priority from U.S. Utility Patent<br>
Application Serial No. 11/215,983 filed August 31, 2005 and now issued U.S. Patent<br>
No. 7,066,890 issued June 27, 2006 and U.S. Provisional Patent Application Serial<br>
No. 60/720,845 filed September 27, 2005 and U.S. Provisional Patent Application<br>
Serial No. 60/731,663 filed October 31, 2005.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
[0003] Hypertension is one of modern society's most insidious<br>
diseases. Left untreated, it causes life-threatening problems including<br>
atherosclerosis, strokes and aneurysms. Long-term hypertension can result in<br>
diminished cardio-vascular and kidney function. Yet while high blood pressure is<br>
one of the simplest problems to detect in an entirely non-invasive process, it is all too<br>
commonly undetected in a large portion of the population. In the past twenty years<br>
or so, with the advent of low-cost microprocessor chips and miniature digital<br>
electronics and electromagnetic devices, the self-measurement of blood pressure by<br>
non-medical personnel has become more readily available. Nevertheless, blood<br>
pressure sphygmomanometers are still too sophisticated for a large segment of the<br>
population. Even those who are entirely capable of operating such devices tend to<br>
put them away in drawers and other out of the way places where they often remain<br>
mostly forgotten and unused.<br>
[0004] It would be highly advantageous to the early detection of<br>
hypertension and thus to the general health of the population if there were a way to<br>
provide prolific availability of blood pressure monitoring devices that were readily<br>
accessible and even easier to use than currently available digital<br><br>
WO 2007/028107	PCT/US2006/034383<br>
3<br>
sphygmomanometers. Having a blood pressure sphygmomanometer at virtually<br>
every computer or television set with a pressure cuff always immediately adjacent to<br>
each computer or television remote control unit, would go a long way to serving such<br>
an advantageous function. Such is the purpose of the present invention.<br><br>
WO 2007/028107	PCT/US2006/034383<br>

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0005] The present invention combines the blood pressure<br>
sphygmomanometer with the most commonly available devices of the modern world,<br>
the computer mouse and the cell phone. Moreover, the invention incorporates the<br>
sphygmomanometer cuff into the computer mouse in a manner which makes it<br>
extremely simple and convenient to initiate and carry out the blood pressure<br>
measurement process. Three alternative mouse embodiments are illustrated and<br>
discussed herein. In one such embodiment the sphygmomanometer cuff is<br>
nominally positioned within the mouse structure and is extended outside the mouse<br>
housing during the measurement. In another embodiment, the cuff is always<br>
external of the mouse structure and is easily connected to the mouse at special ports<br>
during the measurement. In yet another embodiment, the cuff is always internal of<br>
the mouse structure and is readily accessible through an aperture in the housing<br>
surface of the mouse to permit the measurement to take place. Preferably, in each<br>
of these alternative embodiments a hinged or slidable door or panel protects the cuff<br>
or cuff ports between measurements. In the cell phone embodiment, a wrist cuff and<br>
its associated pump, sensor and valve are connected to the cell phone which has<br>
received associated software. In yet another embodiment, a pressure cuff and<br>
associated components are connected directly to a television remote control for<br>
wireless transmission to a television or set-top box connected to a television. In all<br>
of the embodiments shown herein, the sphygmomanometer cuff is configured for<br>
receiving a human finger or wrist in circumambient pressured engagement using<br>
controlled air pressure to vary the cuff engagement pressure in a precise manner.<br>
[0006] In a well-known manner used in blood pressure<br>
sphygmomanometers of all kinds, the pressure of the cuff/finger engagement is<br>
initially increased until arterial vessel pulsation is beyond cutoff (total occlusion of the<br>
artery). The cuff pressure is then slowly decreased until first detection of arterial<br>
vessel pulsation (commonly known as Korotkoff Phase I). The corresponding cuff<br>
pressure at this point will be substantially equal to systolic blood pressure which is<br>
one significant parameter to be monitored. As cuff pressure continues to be<br>
decreased, arterial vessel pulsations will eventually become undetectable through<br><br>
WO 2007/028107	PCT/US2006/034383<br>
5<br>
the cuff because of the lack of adequate cuff pressure to sense those pulsations<br>
(commonly known as Korotkoff Phase V). The pressure of the cuff at this point will<br>
be substantially equal to diastolic blood pressure which is another significant<br>
parameter to be monitored. Moreover, the frequency of pulsations sensed between<br>
the systolic and diastolic pressures is measured and will be substantially equal to the<br>
heartbeat rate or pulse rate which is also a parameter of some significance to be<br>
monitored. These two cuff pressures and the pulsation frequency are the measured<br>
parameter data of the process and corresponding digital data are sent to the<br>
computer to which the mouse controller is associated.<br>
[0007] Computer software, to be described herein, can then utilize this<br>
digital data (typically in binary form) to create a suitable display of the measured<br>
parameters on the computer's monitor. Other functions can also be carried out such<br>
as recording the data, graphically plotting data over numerous measurements and<br>
communicating the data to others such as by means of the internet for example by e-<br>
mail to pre-assigned medical personnel.<br>
[0008] The principal advantage of the present invention is therefore<br>
clearly the proliferation of a simple and convenient way for the great number of<br>
computer and cell phone users to have the benefits of frequent blood pressure<br>
monitoring. Moreover, because the computer mouse can normally be readily<br>
replaced in existing computers, this clearly beneficial health-related device can be<br>
enjoyed by substantially every computer user and his or her family with relatively<br>
little investment. Moreover, virtually any cell phone user will ultimately be able to<br>
easily monitor and record his or her blood pressure and pulse rate by simply placing<br>
a wrist cuff on their wrist and connect it to their cell phone. Society as a whole will<br>
benefit from the likely increase in the early detection of hypertension and the<br>
resulting timely treatment thereof and prevention of related diseases.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
MOUSE CONTROLLER EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0019] Referring to the accompanying figures and to FIGs. 1 through 6<br>
initially, it will be seen that a first embodiment mouse controller 10 comprises a<br>
housing 12, click buttons 13 and 15 and control device 14. It will be understood that<br>
the precise configuration of the mouse controller hereof may be varied to virtually<br>
any of the many conventional designs. Therefore the shape, location and number of<br>
click buttons, the control device 14 and the shape of the housing 12 are all shown<br>
herein as illustrative only and should not be deemed limiting of the scope hereof.<br>
However, what is a significant improvement over conventional mouse controllers<br>
now follows.<br>
[0020] As seen in FiGs. 1 and 2, a hinged door 16 is provided on the<br>
side of mouse housing 12. Hinged door 16, when opened about a hinge 17, leads to<br>
the interior of housing 12 where a sphygmomanometer 21 and its cuff assembly 18<br>
are located. As will be hereafter more fully described, upon activation of the<br>
sphygmomanometer 21, cuff assembly 18 extends through door 16 to the exterior of<br>
the mouse housing as shown best in FIGs. 3 to 5. This extension of the cuff<br>
assembly is facilitated by folding door 16 about hinge 17 until it is in alignment with<br>
an inner door stage 19 which is, in turn, extended beyond the housing 12 and rotated<br>
about its hinge 20 until the door assembly is fully rotated about 270 degrees into a<br>
rectangular recess 22 in the bottom surface 24 of the housing as shown in FiGs. 3<br>
and 4 in particular. When the cuff assembly 18 is fully extended into the position<br>
shown in FIG. 5, the cuff assembly is in suitable position for insertion of a person's<br>
extended finger for measurement of blood pressure and pulse rate. The assembly<br>
may then be re-inserted into the housing and the door assembly rotated back into<br>
position for closure of the housing and normal, conventional usage of the mouse<br>
controller 10.<br>
[0021] The sphygmomanometer 21 including pressure cuff assembly<br>
18 is shown in FIG. 6 as it sits within the housing 12 and the cuff assembly and<br><br>
WO 2007/028107	PCT/US2006/034383<br>
9<br>
attendant components are shown in detail in FIGs. 7 to 9. As seen in those figures,<br>
the sphygmomanometer 21 comprises an inflatable air bag 25 within the annular<br>
interior of cuff assembly 18. Also forming sphygmomanometer 21 are solenoid 26,<br>
extender arm 28, motorized air pump 30, pressure sensor 32 and release valve 34.<br>
Solenoid 26 and extender arm 28 provide the ability to extend the cuff assembly 18<br>
out of the housing 12 as previously described in conjunction with FIGs. 3 to 5. Air<br>
pump 30 provides the pressurized air to selectively expand air bag 25 to forcefully<br>
grasp a finger protruding through cuff assembly 18. Pressure sensor 32 senses the<br>
pressure at the air bag/finger surface interface and release valve 34 releases air<br>
from the air bag 25 at a rate that is commensurate with sensor 32 oscillometrically<br>
sensing the systolic and diastolic blood pressure at the inserted finger.<br>
[0022] FIGs. 10 and 11 illustrate a second embodiment mouse<br>
controller 40 having a housing 42, click buttons 43 and 45 and control device 45. In<br>
this embodiment, the housing provides jacks 46 and 48 to which an external cuff<br>
assembly 50 having an air bag 52, is attached by connectors 54 and 56. A<br>
connector brace 58 mates with a brace receptacle 60 to further support the cuff<br>
assembly 50. The remaining components of the sphygmomanometer (less extender<br>
arm 28 and solenoid 26 which aren't required in this second embodiment) are interior<br>
to housing 42. Once the cuff assembly 50 is attached to the controller 40, the<br>
operation of the second embodiment is identical to that of the first embodiment 10. A<br>
jack cover 47 may be employed to protect the jacks 46 and 48 when the<br>
sphygmomanometer is not in use.<br>
[0023] FIGs. 12 and 13 illustrate a third illustrative embodiment mouse<br>
controller 70 having a housing 72, click buttons 73 and 75 and control device 74. In<br>
this embodiment a sphygmomanometer is fully contained in a fixed position interior<br>
of housing 72 which has apertures 76 axially aligned on opposed side surfaces of<br>
the housing. Within apertures 76 is positioned a cuff assembly 78 and an air bag 80<br>
to receive a person's finger for blood pressure and pulse rate measurement as<br>
previously described.<br>
[0024] FIG. 14 is a block diagram of the sphygmomanometer/computer<br>
interface showing that the air bag is connected through air tubes to the pump, the<br><br>
WO 2007/028107	PCT/US2006/034383<br>
10<br>
pressure sensor and release valve. These components, in turn, receive commands<br>
and provide pressure data to a computer through an MCU and USB to UART bridge<br>
and the computer's USB port. FIG. 15 shows the typical data transmitted to the<br>
computer during the blood pressure measurement and from which the systolic,<br>
diastolic blood pressure and pulse rate parameters are obtained. FIG. 16 illustrates<br>
a typical display presented on the computer monitor after a measurement is<br>
completed. The data may be logged and graphically displayed over multiple<br>
measurements to provide a time-based record of changes in blood pressure and<br>
pulse rate.<br>
CELL PHONE AND DIRECT COMPUTER EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0025] FIG. 17 illustrates a wrist cuff/cell phone version of the invention<br>
in which a sphygmomanometer 90 comprises a pressure cuff 92 configured for<br>
compressively engaging a person's wrist. A small attached housing 94 contains an<br>
air pump, pressure sensor and release valve (not shown) of the type previously<br>
described in conjunction with the finger cuff of FIGs. 1 through 14. The cuff 92 and<br>
housing 94 may be electrically connected to a cell phone 95 by a cable 96 and<br>
connector 97. The cell phone 95 may preferably have a display 98 for presenting the<br>
same type of information as shown in FIG. 16 including graphical data as well as<br>
data in alphanumeric form. Cell phone 95 may preferably be connectable to a PC or<br>
laptop computer (not shown) to download such data to the computer and/or to<br>
receive programming for operation with the sphygmomanometer 90 as required for<br>
compatible operation.<br>
[0026] As shown in FIG. 18, the wrist cuff of FIG. 17 may also be<br>
connected directly to a computer 100 such as through a USB connector 101 thereby<br>
bypassing the cell phone and displaying health status data on a computer display<br>
102 in realtime.<br>
[0027] Television Remote Control Unit<br>
As shown in FIG. 19, the wrist cuff of FIG. 17 may also be<br>
connected to a television remote control unit 110 which wirelessly transmits the<br>
measured data to a nearby television 112 for display thereon. A set-top box 114<br><br>
WO 2007/028107	PCT/US2006/034383<br>
11<br>
may be used to receive the data from the remote control unit 110 and configure the<br>
data as a corresponding message to be displayed on the television screen 115 such<br>
as shown in FIG. 19. Direct interface to a television set is also contemplated.<br>
[0028] It will now be understood that the present invention provides a<br>
novel, convenient way of measuring and tracking health-based parameters by<br>
utilizing either a modified computer mouse controller that facilitates obtaining such<br>
parameters at virtually every computer or a cell phone and wrist cuff combination<br>
that facilitates measurement of such parameters using otherwise conventional eel!<br>
phones.. While various alternative embodiments have been disclosed herein, other<br>
variations will now be perceived by those having the benefit of the description herein.<br>
Accordingly, the scope hereof is not limited by the illustrative features described<br>
herein, but only by the appended claims and their equivalents.<br>

AMENDED PAGE<br><br>
A sphygmomanometer cuff assembly, air pump, pressure sensor and release valve are contained in an otherwise<br>
conventional computer mouse controller or are attached to a cell phone, television remote control or directly to a computer. In<br>
one embodiment the sphygmomanometer cuff is nominally positioned within a mouse structure and is extended outside the mouse<br>
housing during the measurement. In another embodiment, the cuff is always external of the mouse structure and is easily connected<br>
to the mouse at special ports during the measurement. In yet another embodiment, the cuff is always internal of the mouse structure<br>
and is readily accessible through an aperture in the housing surface of the mouse to permit the measurement to take place. In yet<br>
another embodiment, a wrist cuff and associated pump, sensor and valve are designed to be selectively connected to a cell phone to<br>
which appropriate software has been downloaded from a computer.</td>
