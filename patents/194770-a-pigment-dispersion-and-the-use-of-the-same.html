This invention relates to a pigment dispersion and the use of the same.<br><br>
a)	Field of the Invention	<br>
This invention relates to a pigment dispersant and also a pigment dispersion, and more specifically to a pigment dispersion excellent in fluidity and storage stability and especially suitable for the production of color filters.<br>
b)	Description of the Related Art<br>
A color filter, which is useful for the production of a liquid crystal color display, an image pickup device or the like, has conventionally been produced primarily by spin-coating a color filter substrate with a pigment dispersion for the color filter - said pigment dispersion containing pigments of three colors, that is, red (R), green (G) and blue (B) dispersed in a solution of a photosensitive resin - to form a color film, exposing the color film to light through a photomask, and then developing the exposed color film to form the color film into a pattern so that desired pixels are formed.<br>
As primary pigments for use in the production of color filters, phthalocyanin green, for example, C.I. Pigment Green (hereinafter called "P.G.") 36 is gener-<br><br>
- 2 -<br>
ally used as a green color, and anthraquinone red, for example, C.I. Pigment Red (hereinafter called "P.R.") 177 is generally employed as a red color. There are however differences in color characteristics between the hues of these pigments and color characteristics required for liquid crystal displays, so that for both the colors, a yellow pigment is also used in combination in a small amount as a complementary color.<br>
As a film-forming resin in the pigment dispersion for the color filters, an acrylic resin having an acid value high enough to permit development with an alkaline aqueous solution is mainly adopted. However, in a pigment dispersion formed of the above-described conventional pigments and the acrylic resin of the high acid value, coagulation of the pigments takes place so that the viscosity of the pigment dispersion tends to become higher with time. The pigment dispersion therefore has poor storage stability in many instances. When a color filter is produced by a process which makes use of the pigment dispersion accompanied by such difficulties as described above, the pigment dispersion is coated on a color filter substrate by spin-coating. If the viscosity of the pigment dispersion is high or if pigment particles in the dispersion undergoes floc-culation and the pigment dispersion exhibits thixo-<br><br>
- 3 -<br>
tropic viscosity, a coating formulation becomes thicker around a central portion of the substrate. This leads to occurrence of unevenness in color hue and dif-ferences in density between a color film on the central part and that on a peripheral part of the substrate upon production of a large-screen color filter.<br>
Accordingly, a pigment dispersion for color fil-ters must be in such a dispersion state as being free from mutual flocculation of its pigment particles and must have a low viscosity of from 5 to 20 centipoises viscosity and excellent storage stability, despite its pigment content is generally in a range of from 5 to 10 wt.%. With a view to overcoming these problems, it is disclosed in Japanese Patent Applications Laid-open (Kokai) Nos. SHO 60-237403 and SHO 60-247603 that addi-tion of a derivative of a phthalocyanine blue pigment to a green pigment or a derivative of an anthanthrone pigment to a red pigment as a dispersant for the pig-ment can prevent flocculation of the pigment and can obtain a uniform pigment dispersion.<br>
However, phthalocyanine green which ia used primarily as a green color for color filters results in a pigment dispersion reduced substantially in viscosity when the derivative of the phthalocyanine blue pigment is added as a dispersant to the dispersion, although<br><br>
- 4 -<br>
the resultant pigment dispersion has excellent storage stability. As the above-described derivative of the phthalocyanine blue pigment generally has a blue color, the addition of the derivative is accompanied by a drawback in that the maximum absorption wavelength at green pixels in a color filter is caused to shift toward a lower wavelength side, light transmitted therethrough becomes more bluish and a color display so formed is low in color quality as a color display for use in a liquid crystal display. For the yellow pig-ment used as a complementary color for a green color, the phthalocyanine blue pigment is not found to have significant dispersing effects.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
To develop a pigment derivative (dispersant) capable of solving the above-described drawback of the conventional pigment derivative as a dispersant, the present inventors have proceeded with an extensive in-vestigation. As a result, it has been found that a particular anthraquinonylaminotriazine compound common-ly acts as an excellent dispersant for both the phthalocyanine green as a primary pigment for a green color and the yellow pigment as a complementary pigment therefor and can achieve a reduction in the viscosity<br><br>
- 5 -<br>
of a pigment dispersion, that the resultant pigment dispersion is prevented from thickening and gelatiniza-tion during storage and has been improved in clarity most important for color filters, and that surprising-ly, the particular anthraquinonylaminotriazine compound also exhibits considerable dispersing effects for the anthraquinone red (P,R. 177) and pyrropyrrole pigments (P.R. 254, P.O. 71) as primary pigments for a red color, leading to the completion of the present inven-tion.<br>
The present invention therefore provides a pig-ment dispersant represented by the following formula (1), a pigment dispersion for a color filter, said dis-persion making use of the dispersant, a process for the production of a color filter, and a color filter ob-tained by the process.<br><br>
wherein X represents a hydrogen atom or an acylamino<br><br>
- 6 -<br>
group; Y represents an anthraquinonylamino group having a hydrogen atom or an acylamino group at the 5-position thereof, a phenylamino group or a phenoxy group; Z represents an anthraquinonylamino group having a hydrogen atom or an acylamino group at the 5-position thereof, a phenylamino group, a phenoxy group or a C2-30 aliphatic, alicyclic or heteroalicyclic amine reac-tion residual group having at least one amino group; G represents a reaction residual group of at least one compound selected from C2-30 aliphatic, alicyclic and heteroalicyclic hydrocarbons each of which has at least one amino group; n is an integer of from 0 to 3; and when N stands for O, Z represents a reaction residual group of a C2-30 aliphatic, alicyclic or hetero-alicyclic polyamine having at least two amino groups.<br>
According to the present invention, the addition and use of the dispersant of this invention as a dis-persant in pigments dispersions for the formation of an R color pattern and a G color pattern in a color filter makes it possible to prepare the pigment dispersions stably. Further, the eventual use of the pigment dis-persions as pigment dispersions for the color filter results in color films excellent in spectral curve characteristics, high in vividness and brightness, high in clarity, and also superb in various fastness such as<br><br>
- 7 -<br>
light fastness, heat resistance, solvent resistance, chemical resistance and waterproofness. Therefore, color patterns can be obtained with these excellent characteristics.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION AND PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The pigment dispersant according to the present invention is useful as a dispersant for a variety of pigments known to date, and is useful as a dispersant for diverse pigments employed as coloring agents in various paints, printing inks, pigment printing agents and synthetic resins. It is particularly useful as a dispersant in pigment dispersions for color filters. The present invention will hereinafter be described taking, as a typical example, a pigment dispersion for color filters.<br>
The use of the anthraquinonylaminotriazine com-pound, which is represented by the formula (1), as a dispersant for a pigment in the pigment dispersion ac-cording to the present invention for color filters has made it possible to prevent flocculation of particles of the pigment in the pigment dispersion. The struc-tural viscosity of the pigment dispersion is therefore lowered, whereby low viscosity is exhibited. As a<br><br>
- 8 -<br>
result, the thickening and gelatinization of the pig-ment dispersion are suppressed, leading to an increase in storage stability.<br>
The dispersant of the formula (1) according to the present invention has a yellow, orange yellow or brown color and, when added to a green pigment disper-sion making use of phthalocyanine green as a principal pigment of the pigment dispersion, shifts the maximum absorption wavelength of the green pigment to a longer wavelength side, so that pixels of desired color quali-ty can be formed when employed in a color filter for a liquid crystal display or the like.<br>
When added to a red pigment dispersion making use of the anthraquinone red (P.R. 177) as a principal pig-ment, the above-described dispersant is considered to be strongly adsorbed on surfaces of the anthraquinone red pigment owing to the possession of the anthra-quinone structure, whereby alkylamino group(s) intro-duced in the dispersant appears to develop a strong af-finity to free carboxylic groups in a film-forming resin dissolved in the pigment dispersion to impart liquid medium compatibility to the pigment and also to prevent flocculation of the pigment owing to effects of the dispersant such as steric hindrance.<br>
The present invention will next be described in<br><br>

The above-exemplified anthraquinonylaminotriazine compounds can be produced, for example, by the produc-tion process disclosed in Japanese Patent Publications (Kokoku) Nos. SHO 46-33232, SHO 46-33233 and SHO 46-34518 or similar processes. Upon production, reactions are carried out, for example, by heating 1 to 3 moles of 1-aminoanthraquinone and 1 mole of cyanuric chloride in a solvent such as phenol at 110°C for 5 hours and then at 150°C for 2 to 3 hours and subsequent to addi-tion of 0 to 2 moles of another primary amine and a phenol, heating the resulting reaction mixture at 150°C for 2 to 3 hours.<br><br>
- 14 -<br>
Concerning the synthesis of the dispersants (B), a description will be made about one example. The above-described anthraquinonylaminotriazine compound to be used as a raw material is dissolved in concentrated sulfuric acid, fuming sulfuric acid or polyphosphoric acid, to which paraformaldehyde and a monochloro-acetamide are reacted to obtain a compound represented by the below-described formula (b). Examples of the monochloroacetamide usable in this reaction can include monochloroacetamide, N-methyl-monochloroacetamide, N-ethyl-monochloroacetamide, 3-chloropropionamide, N-methyl-3-chloropropionamide, and N-ethyl-3-chloro-propionamide.<br>
As another process, the anthraquinonylamino-triazine compound as a raw material is added to a mixed solution of concentrated sulfuric acid or fuming sul-furic acid and chlorosulfonic acid, followed by the ad-dition of paraformaldehyde to conduct a chloromethyla-tion reaction so that a compound represented by the below-described formula (b) is obtained. As an alternative, the compound represented by the formula (b) can also be obtained by reacting phosphorus oxychloride to the compound represented by the formula (a) in the presence of dimethylformamide or the like.<br><br>
- 15 -<br><br>
wherein X, Y, 2 and n have the same meanings as defined above, R3 represents a hydrogen atom or a lower alkyl group, and k stands for an integer of 1 or 2.<br>
The compound represented by the formula (a) or (b) is next reacted, in water or an inert solvent, with at least one amino compound selected from C2-30 aliphatic, alicyclic and heteroalicyclic hydrocarbons having at least one amino group, whereby a dispersant of the present invention represented by the formula (c)<br><br>
- 16 -or (d) is synthesized.<br><br>
wherein X, Y, Z, R1, R2, R3, k and n has the same mean-ings as defined above, m stands for an integer of from 2 to 30, and l stands for an integer of 0 or 1.<br>
To obtain the dispersant of this invention represented by the formula (c) or (d), an amino com-pound having a primary or secondary amino group is reacted to the compound of the formula (a) or (b). The reaction between the compound of the formula (a) or (b)<br><br>
- 17 -<br>
and such an amino compound is conducted by heating the compound of the formula (a) or (b) in the presence of an excess amount of the amino compound in water or an inert solvent at 50 to 150°C for several hours. As the amino compound for use in the reaction, a known primary or secondary monoamine selected from C2-30 aliphatic, alicyclic and heteroalicyclic hydrocarbons can be used, but a preferred amine is the above-described polyamine used employed for the production of the dispersant (A).<br>
Groups preferred as the substituent group G in the dispersant (B) according to the present invention are the following groups:<br><br>
wherein R1, R2 and :m have the same meanings as defined above.<br>
To prepare a pigment dispersion by using the pig-ment dispersant according to the present invention, the pigment dispersant according to the present invention is used in a proportion of from 0.5 to 50 parts by weight, preferably from 1 to 30 parts by weight per 100<br><br>
- 18 -<br>
parts by weight of a pigment. The effects of the pig-ment dispersant according to the present are not recog-nized practically if it is used in an amount smaller than 0.5 part by weight, but, even if it is used in an amount greater than 50 parts by weight, its effects cannot be brought about as much as the amount used.<br>
As a method for preparing the pigment dispersion according to the present invention, a pigment and a dispersant are added in and premixed with an organic solvent solution or aqueous solution containing an ap-propriate film-forming resin, and subsequent to mixing, the resultant mixture is subjected to dispersion treat-ment. For example, the pigment and dispersant are evenly mixed and ground in a disperser such as a tum-bler, Henschel mixer, hammer mill, pin mill, kneader, attritor or ball mill. The mixture so obtained is thereafter added in and mixed with a solution contain-ing the film-forming resin. As an alternative, the pigment is uniformly suspended in water or an organic solvent. A solution containing the dispersant is added to and mixed with the suspension. The pigment parti-cles with the dispersant adsorbed thereon is added in and mixed with a solution containing the film-forming resin. As another alternative, the pigment and dis-persant are dissolved in sulfuric acid or the like and<br><br>
- 19 -<br>
subsequent to that, the sulfuric acid solution is caused to crystallized in water to separate them as a solid solution. The solid solution is added in and mixed with a solution containing the film-forming resin.<br>
As the solution containing the film-forming resin for dispersing the pigment into the pigment dispersion in the present invention, a solution containing the film-forming resin, said solution being used in conventionally-known pigment dispersions for color fil-ters, is used. As the solution medium, an organic sol-vent, water, or a mixture of an organic solvent and water is used. Further, conventionally-known addi-tives, for example, additives such as a dispersing aid, a smoothing agent and an adhering agent can be added to the pigment dispersion.<br>
The weight proportion of the pigment relative to the film-forming resin in the solution containing the film-forming resin may preferably be in a range of from 5 parts by weight to 500 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the film-forming resin. As the solution with the film-forming resin contained therein, either a solution containing a photosensitive film-forming resin or a solution containing a non-photosensitive film-forming resin can be used. Examples of the solution<br><br>
- 20 -<br>
containing the photosensitive film-forming resin can include solutions containing photosensitive film-forming resins which are usable in ultraviolet curing inks and electron radiation curing inks, respectively. Illustrative of the solution containing the non-photosensitive film-forming resin can be varnishes for use in printing inks such as letterpress inks, litho-graphic inks, intaglio gravure inks and stencil screen inks, varnishes for use in room-temperature curing paints and baking paints, varnishes for use in elec-trodeposition coating, varnishes for use in developers for electronic printing and electrostatic printing, and varnishes for use in thermal transfer ribbons.<br>
Illustrative photosensitive film-forming resins can include photosensitive cyclizing ribbon resins, photosensitive phenol resins, photosensitive polyacry-late resins, photosensitive polyamide resins and photosensitive polyimide resins, as well as unsaturated polyester resins, polyester acrylate resins, polyepoxy acrylate resins, polyurethane acrylate resins, polyether acrylate resins and polyol acrylate resins. Further, various monomers can also be added as reactive extenders. Preferred resins out of the above-described photosensitive film-forming resins are alkali-developable acrylate resins each of which contains free<br><br>
- 21 -<br>
carboxylic groups in its molecule.<br>
Further, a photo-curing, photosensitive pigment dispersion can be formed by adding a photopolymeriza-tion initiator such as benzoin ether or benzophenone to a pigment dispersion containing a photosensitive resin and then kneading the resultant mixture by a conventionally-known method. A heat-curing pigment dispersion can also be obtained by using a thermal polymerization initiator instead of the above-mentioned photopolymerization initiator.<br>
To form a color filter pattern with the above-described photosensitive pigment dispersion, it is necessary to conduct full coating on a transparent color filter substrate such as a glass substrate with photosensitive pigment dispersion by means of a spin coater, low-speed rotating coater, roll coater, knife coater or the like or as an alternative, to perform full printing or partial printing for a size somewhat greater than the pattern by one of various printing methods. Subsequent to provisional drying, a photomask is brought into close contact with the thus-formed film, which is then subjected to exposure by using an extra-high pressure mercury vapor lamp to bake the pat-tern. Development and washing are then conducted and if necessary, post-baking is performed, whereby the<br><br>
color filter pattern can be formed.<br>

A glass substrate, which had been treated with a silane coupling agent, was mounted on a spin coater, on which the above photosensitive R pigment dispersion for the color filter was spin-coated first at 300 rpm for 5 seconds and then at 1,200 rpm for 5 seconds. The thus-coated glass substrate was next prebaked at 80°C for 10 minutes. A photomask of a mosaic pattern was brought into close contact with the prebaked coating, followed by exposure at a light quantity of 100 mJ/cm2 under an extra-high pressure mercury vapor lamp. Development<br><br>

Compared with the green base color of Comparative Example B1, the green base colors obtained in Examples B1-B8 were shifted toward a longer wavelength side in maximum transmission wavelength, were lower in vis-cosity, and had smaller viscosity increases after stored for one month. Compared with the red base color of Comparative Example B2 and the yellow base color of Comparative Example B3, respectively, the red base color of Example B9 and the yellow base color of Exam-ples B10 were significantly lower in viscosity both in-itially and one month later, although there was no sub-stantial difference in hue. Example B12<br>
For the production of an RGB color filter, photosensitive R, G and B pigment dispersions were ob-tained in accordance with the corresponding composi-tions shown below in Table 6. The blue base color was prepared by using Cyanine Blue P.B. 15:6 and a commercially-available derivative of phthalocyanine blue in place of the cyanine green in Comparative Exam-ple B1.<br><br>

A glass substrate, which had been treated with a silane coupling agent, was mounted on a spin coater, on which the above photosensitive R pigment dispersion for the color filter was spin-coated first at 300 rpm for 5 seconds and then at 1,200 rpm for 5 seconds. The thus-coated glass substrate was next prebaked at 8 0°C for 10 minutes. A photomask of a mosaic pattern was brought into close contact with the prebaked coating, followed by exposure at a light quantity of 100 mJ/cm2 under an extra-high pressure mercury vapor lamp. Development<br><br>
- 50 -<br>
and washing were next conducted with an exclusive de-veloper and an exclusive rinse, respectively, whereby a red mosaic pattern was formed on the glass substrate.<br>
A green mosaic pattern and a blue mosaic pattern were then formed, respectively, from the above-described photosensitive G and B pigment dispersions for the color filter by conducting coating and baking in a similar manner as the above-described methods, so that the RGB color filter was obtained. The color fil-ter so obtained had excellent spectral curve character-istics, was excellent in fastness such as light fast-ness and heat resistance, had excellent properties in light transmission too, and was equipped with superb properties as a color filter for use in a liquid crys-tal color display.<br>
Examples Directed to Other Application Fields Example C1<br>
Ten (10) parts of Dispersant A1 were dissolved in 100 parts of an aqueous solution containing 5 parts of glacial acetic acid, and the thus-formed solution was added to a slurry of a yellow pigment (PY-110) (pigment content: 100 parts), followed by stirring for 60 minutes. Next, a 10% aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide was slowly added to adjust the pH of the sys-tem to 8.5. After the resultant solution was stirred<br><br>
- 51 -<br>
for 30 minutes, the resultant solid matter was col-lected by filtration, washed, dried at 90°C and then ground, whereby 108 parts of surface-treated yellow pigment powder were obtained.<br>
When the pigment composition obtained as de-scribed above was dispersed in a commercial melamine/alkyd paint by a ball mill (pigment content: 15%), the resultant dispersion was low in viscosity and showed fluidity practically resembling a Newtonian flow. When a pale yellow paint was prepared by mixing this yellow paint with a commercially-available melamine/alkyd white pigment and was then stored for one week, it remained in a homogeneous state without color separation. As a comparative example, the yellow pigment (PY-110) which had not been subjected to sur-face treatment with Dispersant A1 was dispersed with the same composition, the resultant dispersion was high in viscosity and, when mixed with the white paint into a mixed paint, the yellow pigment underwent floccula-tion, resulting in occurrence of its separation and settlement. Example C2<br>
Eight (8) parts of Dispersant A1 were dissolved in 100 parts of an aqueous solution containing 5 parts of glacial acetic acid, and the thus-formed solution<br><br>
- 52 -<br>
was added to a slurry of a yellow pigment (PY-154) (pigment content: 100 parts), followed by stirring for 60 minutes. Next, a 10% aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide was slowly added to adjust the pH of the sys-tem to 8.5. After the resultant solution was stirred for 30 minutes, the resultant solid matter was col-lected by filtration, washed, dried at 90°C and then ground, whereby 105 parts of surface-treated yellow pigment powder were obtained.<br>
The thus-obtained pigment composition was dis-persed in a commercially-available acrylic lacquer by a beads mill, whereby a yellow paint having a pigment content of 13% was prepared. The paint was adjusted in viscosity with a lacquer thinner and spray-coated on an iron plate, whereby a yellow-colored, coated plate hav-ing a dry coating thickness of 32 µm was obtained. The coated plate was excellent in vividness and showed high gloss. For the sake of comparison, the yellow pigment (PY-154) which had not been subjected to surface treat-ment with Dispersant A2 was dispersed with the same composition and, subsequent to an adjustment in vis-cosity, the resultant dispersion was spray-coated to prepare a yellow-colored, coated plate. It was not smooth on the surface of the coating, and was low in gloss.<br><br>
- 53 -<br>
Example C3<br>
A green paint having a total pigment content of 15% was prepared by adding Dispersant A3 in a propor-tion of 8% based on a green pigment (PG -7) upon dis-persing the green pigment in the commercially-available melamine/alkyd paint. Compared with a paint not added with Dispersant A3, the thus-obtained paint had a some-what yellowish hue but, when its fluidity was measured, had low viscosity and showed a flowing behavior close to a Newtonian flow. When Dispersant A3 was mixed with the commercially-available melamine/alkyd white paint and the resultant pale green paint was stored at 50°C for 1 week, the paint with Dispersant A3 added therein was a homogeneous pale green paint, but in a paint prepared without Dispersant A3, the green pigment and the white pigment had undergone flocculation and a sub-stantially clear liquid medium was observed as an upper layer in an upper part of the paint.<br>
In the above description, the pigment dispersants according to the present invention were described based on the production examples of the color filters and the preparation examples of the paints as representative examples. The present invention is however not limited only to the production of color filters and the prepa-ration paints, but the pigment dispersants according to<br><br>
- 54 -<br>
the present invention are useful, for example, as dis-persants for various pigments known to date. Accord-ingly, the pigment dispersants according to the present invention are also useful as dispersants for various pigments which are used in various paints other than those described above, various printing inks, various pigment printing agents, synthetic resin coloring agents, and the like.<br><br>
