				<td>PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONS FOR ORALAND TOPICAL<br>
ADMINISTRATION<br>
this invention relates to pharmaceutical formulations including, as the active ingredient, substances which arc poorly soluble in water, for example therapeutically active cyclosporins, taxoides and taxancs.<br>
Cyclosporins are a group of monocyclic, poly-N-methyiated undecapeptides, which are naturally produced as secondary metabolites by certain fibrous fimgh especially of general Tolypocladium and Cylindrocarpon. Some therapeutically useful cyclosporin can be prepared by partial synthesis or by special fermentation procedures.<br>
Ciclosoporin (Cyclosporin A) is the first natural substance having selective immunosuppressive effect on lymphoid cells, especially T lymphocytes. It also influences functions of other cells of the immune system to a great extent.<br>
Systcmically administered cyclosporin is used therapeutically in organ transplantations or transplantations of bone-marrow. Cyclospoiin can be employed for treating a wide variety of autoimmune disease- with inflammatory eliology and also cis anti-parasitic agents.<br>
Certain cyclosporins without immunosuppressive activity exhibit an inhibitor effect towards replication of the HIV-1 vims and can be employed in therapy for ucatment and prevention of AIDS or AIDS related complex. The group of cyclosporins also include chernomodulators useful for influencing cross resistance of tumour cells to cytostatics.<br>
Bioavailability of cyclosporin is influenced, on one hand, by specific properties of this group of substances, but also by the composition and properties of the particular dosage form.  Ah important role in formulating therapeutic compositions containing cyclosporin is played by their high Hpophilicity.<br>
Solubility of these active substantia in water typically does not exceed 25 µg/ml which value is approximately 100 times lower than needed tor regular absorption in the organism. The marked lipophilicity of cyclosporin is evidenced by the values of their partition coefficients P in the system n-octanol/water. For cyclosporin, values of log P 2.08 to 2.99 have been reported.<br>
2.<br><br>
To achieve acceptable bioavailability of cyclosporins formulations which are used in practice form dispersion systems and are characterised by the presence of a hydrophilic phase, a hydrophobic phase and a tensoactive component. The resulting dispersions are either classic emulsions or optically transparent microemuisions. Commercially available compositions for oral administration are known under the trade names Sandimunn Sandimunn®-Neora1, Consuprcn®, Implanta®, Imusporin® as described in GB-A-2015339, GB-A-2222770, CB-A-2270842 and GB-A-22787S0.<br>
Modifications of the preceding systems, where the hydrophilic base is omitted and replaced by partial esters of fatty acids with polyols like propylene glycol, glycerol or sorbitol, are desciibed in GB-A-222SI9S-<br>
DE-A-4322826 discloses, as the carrier system for drugs poorly soluble in water, a composition containing polyglyceryl esters of fatty, acids as a co-tenside to non-ionic tensides having HLB higher than 10, in the presence of a triacyl glycerol as the lipophilic component.<br>
Formulations containing cyclosporins in a vehicle comprising propylene glycol, mixed mono-, di- and triglyceride and a hydrophilic tenside, disclosed in GB-A.-2248615, are typical rnicrocemulsion preconcentrates of the oil-in-water type.<br>
According to biopharmaccutical classification, cyclosporins belong to class IV, ie substances whose solubility in water is bad and bioavailability is poor (G L Amidon, Biophamiaceutics Drug Classification and International Drug Regulation, Capsge) Library, Bornem 1996, p 15-30).<br>
Taxoides are a group of natural substances isolated from some strains of Taxus. Taxoidet demonstate antineoplastic effects by influencing cellular mitosis. They are ditcrpenic substances containing taxmic cyclic grouping with a 4-membered oxitanic ring and an csteric side chain in position Cn, Natural paclitaxel and its semisynthetic decivative docetaxel are used for treatment of tumours, Taxanes are even less soluble in water than cyclosporins, immediately after preparation, pnclitaxel solubility in water ranges about 5 µg/ml, however, paclitaxel hydrates which arc formed on standing have an equilibrium concentration which is lower by an order of magnitude (0.3 - 0.6 µg/ml).<br>
Compositions based on polyrdycerol acylesters arc known from the patent literature, eg WO98/05309. Pharmaceutical compositions for internal application containing cyclosporin as active ungredient and a carrier consisting of one or more partial<br>
3<br><br>
esters of fatty acids with di- to decaglycerol and partial peritaglycerol to pentadecaglycerol acylesters are disclosed. Compositions prepared this way enable a skilled person to make a dispersion of emulsion type with an average particle size about 1- 2 µm after dilution. The particles arc of spherical character as shown in Figure 1, However, achievement of high bioavailability remains a problem.<br>
Similarly; WO97/26003 discloses use of polyglycerol acylesters. Besides the above mentioned polyglycerolesters, the vehicle contains glycerol monpacyiesters and optional substances selected from anhydrohexosdimetbyl derivatives and/or polyethylene glycerols. The formulation can also contain other substances which improve the stability of the vehicle and lipoamino acids which are suitable especially for topical products. These compositions provide slightly dispersing systems containing spherical particles.<br>
Other systems utilising polyglyqerol esters with fatty acids fire microernulsions, In EP-A-670715 or EP-A-334777, esters of fatty acids with polyglycerols are used for pharmaceutical or cosmetic microernulsions or compositions forming mieroermilsions. As defined in eg Lachman ct al; Theory and Practice of Industrial Pharmacy, Lea &amp; Febiger, Philadelphia 1970, p 463, a mieroemulsion is a clear dispersion of oil-in-water or water-in-oil having a size of dispersed particles in the range 100 - 600 A. Dispersed particles in a . microemulsion arc composed of nanodrops or mtcellar aggregates of the dispersed phase in the dispersion medium. The shape of dispersed particles is mostly spherical<br>
Similarly, CZ-A-283516 describes use of polyglycero! acylesters as one of the components of vehicle which forms iyotropie liquid crystals in contact with an aqueous phase, In accordance with this specification and other patents (eg EP-A-314689 or EP-A-126751), only pharmaceutical compositions based on systems providing Iyotropie liquid crystnls are suitable and advantageous for formulations of biologically active substances which dissolve in the given system and/or have hydrophobic character. At the same time the capability of formation of a liquid crystal phase in vivo after application into the gastrointestinal tract is associated with high bioavailability of hydrophobic pharmaceutical compositions.<br>
According to a draft of the article Cyclosporine Modified Capsules for USP 23, published in Phannaccopeial Forum Volume 24, Number 3, 1998, p 6155, high bioavailability of cyclosporin is caused by dispersion of a pharmaceutical composition in the form of a pre-concentrate after administration of it microemulsion into (11 tract, The<br>
4<br><br>
draft recommends to lest whether the dispersion arising after dilution of such composition provides particles of mean size 50 nm in the dispersed phase. This topic is discussed in several patents which however do not disclose use of poly glycerol esters of higher fatty acids.<br>
According to a first aspect of the present invention a method of increasing viscosity of a pharmaceutical formulation for oral or topical administration comprises the steps of combining:<br>

between 50 to 150 mols and concurrently the ratio between components b) and d) is from<br>
   01    1 to 10: 1;<br>
wherein the above percentages are selected to total 100%; and wherein upon dilution with water 1:1 by volume the viscosity of the formulation increases by at least 5 times in comparison to the undiluted composition.<br><br>
In preferred formulations a minimum number of excipients are used. This results in economy of manufacture and regulatory requirements. A single compound from each of groups b) to e) is preferred.<br>
According to a second aspect of the present invention there is provided a pharmaceutical formulation for oral or topical administration including<br>
a)	an effective amount of one or more hydrophobic active ingredients;<br>
b)	5 to 50% of one or more compounds selected from polyglycerol esters of fatty acids of formula (1)<br>

between 50 to 150 mols and concunently the ratio between components b) and d) is from<br>
0.1 : 1 to 10: 1;<br>
wherein the above percentages are selected to total 100%,<br>
and wherein upon dilution with water 1:1 by volume the viscosity of the<br>
fformulation  increases by at least 5 times in comparison  to the undiluted composition.<br>

aspect of thts invention fot preparation of a dosage form for administration of a class IV<br>
substance.<br>
6<br><br>
It has been surprisingly found out that high bioavailability of cyclosporins and taxanes after oral application can be achieved using a system neither based on liquid crystals nor a microemulsion. It was also found that a system prepared in accordance with the present invention does not result in a dispersion of the emulsion type. Unexpectedly it has been found that particles which arc formed spontaneously or almost spontaneously on mixing of the phases have a non-spherical character. At the same time, no sign of anisotropic grouping of molecules was found even if the panicles formed exhibited a dramatic increase in viscosity. From these findings it appears that it is a dispersion in water of particles having gel-like properties.<br>
In this specification particles of gel-like character are to be understood as those whose stable shape or conformation in the dispersion is non-spherical. Non-spherical particles are those having at least two different perpendicular dimensions.<br>
In this specification a gel emulsion (GEM) is to be understood as a dispersion of particles of gel character in an aqueous phase,<br>
A pre-concentrate of gel emulsion (PRO-GEM) is to be understood as a composition which results in a gel emulsion after dilution or in contact with an aqueous phase.<br>
The formation of gel particles is caused by interaction between a bydrophilic gelator(an agent which causes formation of gel) and a lipophilic gel-creating phase. Such a composition may contain components which participate in the formation of a particulate gel structure and which facilitate spontaneous dispersion in an aqueous medium. It may also contain components which ensure oxidative or microbial stability, mask the taste, adjust, the appearance or facilitate dissolution of active ingredients in the mixture. The composition may also contain components which adjust viscosity.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions in accordance with the present invention may be used to formulate active substances from class IV according to the btophannaceutical classification.   Also advantages are obtained when substances- from class II and 111 are<br>
used,<br>
According to a third aspect of the present invention a pharmaceutical formulation for oral or topical administration comprises<br>
H)	0.1 to '30.0 % of one or mote hydrophobic active ingredients;<br>
7<br><br>
b)	0,1 to 60,0 % of one or more gelators selected from the group consisting of: fatty acid esiers of polyglyeerol;<br>
c)	0.1 to 60.0 % of one or more gel-creating substances selected from the group consisting of: esters of potyglycerol with fatty acids and/or unsaturated fatty alcohols;<br>
d)	1.0 to 60 % of one or more co-gelator substances selected from the group consisting of: macrogol glyccrolesters of fatty acids, macrogal glycerolcsters of vegetable oils, mactogol esters of fatty acids, mono- and di- maerogol esters of mono-, di-and tri- acylglycerols.<br>
e)	5.0 to 30 % of one or more C2 to C4 alcohols;<br>
wherein the above percentages are selected to total 100%;<br>
and wherein upon dilution with water the formulation fomis-a dispersion of polymorphous gel particles having a dimension of 0.2 to 500 µm.<br>
Percentages and amounts used in this specification are by weight unless indicated otherwise.<br>
In preferred formulations the ratio of a : c and/or a : e is in the range 0.001: 1 to 10:1.<br>
In contrast particles in liquid-liquid emulsions are generally spherical in shape. Panicles of the present invention may have a substantial proportion, for example more than half with a non-spherical shape, for example an ellipsoid, rod-like or string-like shape. Preferably more than half of the particles by weight are elongate having a length more than twice their width or diameter. Formulations of this invention may have a particle size distribution with a median dimension in the range 1 to 100 µm preferably 5 to 20 µm. Formulations may contain individual particles- with a dimension up to 10 µm or mote, for example- 20 to 50 µm.<br>
The formulations of the present invention may be made by mixing for example my manual stirring or shaking in vitro. Liquid formulations may be mixed with water, milk or other drink before: administration. Higher speed striting is less convenient but may be used, particularly to give smaller particle sixes, for example about 200 nm if desired.<br>
Dosage forms comprising a gel-emulsion procorcentrate, eg in capsules, are mixed with aqueous phase in the Gl tract.   Sufficient shear forces arc applied in the GI tract to form the polymorphous particles of the present invention.<br><br>
Pharmaceutical compositions in accordance with the present invention may be characterised in that after dilution by mixing with an aqueous phase in ratio from approx 1 : 5 (composition : aqueous phase) to approx 1 ; 100, a dispersion of gel particles in water with mean size of particles between 0,2 - 500 µm is obtained. Such dispersion may be referred to as a gel emulsion (GEM).<br>
Gel emulsion pre-concentrates (PRO-GEM) may he administered in the form of a pre-concentrate or in single-dose dosage forms such as capsules.<br>
Component a) includes biologically active ingredients which are insufficiently soluble in water for conventional formulation and so their bioavailability is low. According to this biophannaceutical classification, these arc substances of group 2 and 4, with low water solubility, These substances include immunosuppressives, antitumour chemotherapeutical agents, substances influencing saccharide metabolism, peptides and lipids, agents influencing the calcium channel, non-steroidal antiflogistics and vitamins.<br>

Component d), is usually present in the compositions in an amount of 1 - 60 %, preferably in the range 5 - 50 % and most preferably 15 - 50% and most preferably 15 - 40 %.<br>
Component e) is selected from C2 - C4 alkanols, preferably ethyl alcohol of pharmaceopocial quality. Alternative alkanols include isomers of propenol and buterol. Mixtures may be employed.   In topical applications, propan-2-ol, or 2-methyl-l-propatiol, are preferred.<br>
Other exceptants which can be employed in. compositions.of the present invention are those which influence physicochemical and microbial stability (eg antioxidants, antimicrobial additives sucb as tocopherol, methyl paraben), organoleptic properties (eg taste correctors based on natural or nature identical aromas) or physical properties which may limit processing (eg viscosity or melting point). The following can be included among such substances: water or other pbarmaceutically acceptable solvents, hydrophilic colloids eg selected from derivatives of cellulose, chitosans, alginate, polycarbophile etc.<br>
Compositions based on a gel pre-concentrate may be characterised in that they disperse into panicles of gel character primarily of irregular shape after application into an aqueous medium. High bioavailability of such compositions is associated with bioadhesion. As a result of their ampbilicity these particles are less liable to coalescence and may be homogenously dispersed in an aqueous inedium. In contact with a lipophilic surface they remain on the surface and so provide a sufficient concentration gradient to enable drug penetration through the membrane due to their viscosity and adhesivity.<br>

Assessment of Bioavailability and Size Distribution of Particles<br>
A bioavailability study on 12 healthy volunteers was compared bioavailability of two different formulations in soft gelatine capsules each containing 100 mg of cyclosporins (Formulation A-GEM101 and Formulation B-GEM304). These gave a dispersion within the range 1-150 µm with Noreal® 100 mg capsules (Formulation C). Visual observation of the novel drug delivery system and precise evaluation of the particle size distributions were carried out.<br>
Based on the visual observation the novel system was referred to as GEM (Gel based Emulsion).<br>
Composition of Cyclosporin Containing Capsule Fills: Formulation A - GEM 101:<br>
a)	cyclosporin A	1020 g<br>
b)	polyglyceiyl-10 monoolcate:	2 010 g<br>
c)	polyglyecryl-3-monoolcate	3 380g<br>
d)	macrogol (1760) hydrogenated ricine-oleic glyceride	3 000 g<br>
e)	ethanol	1 330 g<br><br>
22 <br>
Formulation B -GEM 304;<br>
a)	cyclosporin A.	1 020 g<br>
b)	polygIyceryl-10-inonooleate	2 630 g<br>
c)	polyglyccryl-3-monooleate	1580g<br><br>
c)	oleyl alcohol	1105g<br>
d)	macrogol (1760) hydrogenated ricine-oleic glyceride	2 450 g<br>
e)	ethanol	1300g<br>
Particle Size Distributions<br>
The particle size distributions of the novel GEM formulations were valuated using a Mastersizer Micro, version 2.18 (Malvern Instruments Ltd). Histograms of particle size distribution of Formulation A (GEM101) and Formulation B (304) showed that the effective diameter of Formulation A (resp, B) deduced from the histogram was 92.05 ,µm (36.23 µm).<br>
Bioequivalence Study Design<br>
An open-label, randomised 3-period crossover study was designed for 12 healthy Caucasian male volunteers, 18 - 45 years of age and with body weights ± 10% of their ideal weights. The test medications and the reference medication were administered in a randomised sequence as single oral doses in the fasted condition. Each dose contained 200 mg cyclosporin (two capsules of 100 mg). The duration of the washout period between treatments was at least 7 days. In each study period, 14 blood  samples were to he taken before administration and 20,40,60 rnin, and 1.5, 2, 2,5, 3,4, 5, 6, 8, 12 and 24 hours after administration. Adverse events were monitored during the entire study.<br>
Blood was taken from the anteeubital vein into EDTA plastic tubes (Sarstedt Monovettes). The samples were deep-frozen (-20 °C).<br>
Cyclosporins whole blood concentrations were determined by means of a specific R1A. AUC(0-1)and Cmax were defined as the primary variables for the evaluation of bioavailability, AUC(0-1) Cmax, 11/2, were secondary variables.<br>
23<br><br>
From the concentration/time data of the patent compound, the pharmacokinetic parameters were determined for each individual data set by means of non-compartmental analysis using TopFit 2.0.<br>
Cmax and tmax were to be taken directly from the observed concentration-time data. The elimination rate constant (kel) was calculated by log-linear least squares regression analys is of the terminal part of the plasma concentration-time curve. The area under the concentration-time curve (AUCO-t) was calculated up to the last measurable concentration-time point (t) by the linear trapezoidal rule. Extrapolation to infinity (AUCO-t, AUC0-8) was done by dividing the last observed concentration by elimination rate constant.<br>

Visualisation of Different Formulations<br>
Different shapes of particles can be obtained by dispersal of formulations disclosed in this application. The following compositions when diluted gave dispersions of polymorphous gel particles. The visualisation technique was as described in Example 5.<br>
Formulations A and B from Example 18 were visualized. A discrepancy between the measured (Mastersizer Micro: example 18) and observed particle sizes was caused by use of different dispersal techniques arid by averaging of the measured values.. .Whilst the sample measured by Mastersizer Micro is continuously mixed by high speed mixer, a sample observed by an optical microscope was softly shaken by hand before putting, under optical microscope.<br>

Example 20:<br>
Assessment of viscosity of arising gel phages.<br>
Compositions disclosed in this specification may exhibit an increase in viscosity in contact with water or aqueous solutions. This feature is particularly important for ensuring bioavailability of an active substance incorporated in such formulation. The viscosities of compositions from Examples 18 and 19 evaluated experimentally.<br>
The rheological properties of chosen compositions were studied on a rotary viscometer Brookfield DV-111 under constant conditions (temperature = 30°C, spindle SC A - 27 ,ultrathermostat Brookfield TC 500, Rheocalc program, 1.3 version).<br>
A standard dilution was used to compare the ability to form a gel phase. Bach sample was diluted 1 : 1 (by volume) with water. The viscosity of the diluted sample was evaluated using an up/down symmetric rheological program. All diluted samples were found to be non-Newtonian liquids. Undiluted samples had characteristics of standard (Newtonian) liquids. The samples were compared at the same Shear Rate, Findings arc summarised in the table  below:<br>
27<br><br>
Rheologlcal parameters ters at the constant Shear Rate = 1.70 sec-1:<br><br>
Formulation	Shear Stress	Viscosity<br>
(dilution status)	(N/m2)	(mPa.s)<br>
Formulation A (undiluted)	0.34	200<br>
Formulation A(diluted)	3.91	2300<br>
Formulation C (diluted)	6.97	4100<br>
Formulation D (diluted)	17.2	10100<br>
Formulation B (diluted)	1.53	900<br>
It was conclude that viscosity of the novel systems could be increased by at least 5x when contacted with water or aqueous solution. Such viscosity increases may have positive impact on the adhesion of the nascent phase and consequently provide an improved bioavailability.<br>
