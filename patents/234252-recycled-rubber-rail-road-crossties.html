				<td>RECYCLED RUBBER RAILROAD CRQSSTffiS<br>
1. Field of the Invention<br>
The invention relates to railroad rail support systems, specifically railroad crossties<br>
or ties, and their method of manufacture.<br>
2. Background of the Invention<br>
The majority of railroad track today is comprised of wooden crossties, sometimes<br>
referred to simply as ties, for alignment and support of iron rails placed thereupon.<br>
However, for a variety of reasons, such as the use of lower quality pine rather than<br>
oak due to high timber costs, alternatives to wooden crossties have become<br>
available to the railroad industry.<br>
These alternative products can be either made of new or recycled materials.<br>
Cement, reinforced concrete, metal, recycled wood, plastic, composites of various<br>
recycled materials, and other products have been made. A relatively new approach<br>
has been to produce a tie from cement having an iron center and encased within<br>
recycled rubber and/or recycled plastics.<br>
These alternative products suffer from one or more significant drawbacks. The<br>
railroad industry is seeking an economical alternative to wood. Drawbacks<br>
encountered with cement and reinforced concrete is that although durable, they<br>
weigh substantially more than ties made from wood. Transportation costs are<br>
higher and handling is more difficult because of the increased weight. Ties made<br>
with a metal core must also be encapsulated with a non-conductive material for<br>
safety and operational concerns. Encapsulation is an additional step which<br>
increases the cost of the tie.<br>
Another significant drawback to these alternative crossties is the relatively low<br>
force required to withdraw a spike driven into the tie. It is highly desirable to have<br>
a higher withdrawal force. A higher withdrawal force translates into a more<br>
secured spike and reduces or eliminates the need to reset a spike.<br>
Additionally, almost all alternative tie products have increased noise levels as<br>
trains pass, due to the surface hardness and steel, cement and plastic cross ties also<br>
tend to undesirably shift in the gravel bed.<br>
As a consequence, demand from the railroad industry for non-wood ties has been<br>
low. It is believed that high demand would exist if a tie could be made for lowcost,<br>
have similar performance characteristics, and have a longer life than a wood<br>
tie.<br>
In the recycle and rubber tire industries, there has been a concern for many years<br>
regarding what to do with discarded tires. A problem facing these industries has<br>
been how to recycle discarded rubber products and especially vehicular tires into<br>
useful and economical end products. More information on the various problems<br>
relating to the disposal and recycling of discarded tires is provided in the<br>
background sections of U.S. Pat. No. 4,726,530 (Miller et. al.) and U.S. Pat. No.<br>
5,094,905 (Murray).<br>
Technology exists for discarded rubber tires to be recycled. Tires are generally<br>
comprised of rubber, steel belts and beads, and fiber such as rayon, nylon and other<br>
polyesters. Present technology can shred and granulate tires and have the metal<br>
separated magnetically, and the fibers removed by vacuum. The rubber can be<br>
shredded or ground into any desired size. This technology is described in the<br>
Miller et. al. patent cited earlier. Utilizing separation technology, discarded rubber<br>
tires are available as a source for recycled products.<br>
As mentioned earlier, another problem facing the railroad industry is tile useful life<br>
or longevity of a crosstie before it requires replacement. This concern is even more<br>
prevalent today than in the past. Presently in the United States, crossties are mostly<br>
made from softwoods such as pine rather than hardwoods such as oak. Softwood<br>
crossties do not have the longevity of hardwoods. As an example, softwood<br>
crossties are susceptible to accelerated deterioration in high moisture<br>
environments. A tie in a swamp area may have an operational life expectancy of<br>
only three to four years. It is believed that the railroad industry would be receptive<br>
to more durable alternatives to wood where cost savings can be realized.<br>
3. Disclosure of Invention<br>
A method to manufacture railroad crossties from discarded rubber has been<br>
developed. The rubber railroad tie can be used as wood tie replacements for new<br>
and re-laid tracks. The rubber railroad tie can be made economically and utilize the<br>
abundant supply of discarded rubber tires stockpiled at waste disposal sites. A<br>
functional new design is disclosed which increases the frictional contact between<br>
the crosstie and a gravel bed to prevent undesired crosstie movement.<br>
4. Summary of Invention<br>
The rubber railroad crosstie made according to the invention ("Tie") is made by a<br>
process which heats granulated recycled rubber (sometimes referred to as crumb<br>
rubber, rubber dust, or rubber fines), preferably not larger than 30 mesh (590<br>
microns). The heated rubber is preferably milled and then extruded to obtain the<br>
desired width and depth and thereafter cut to the desired length.<br>
Recycled crumb rubber (RCR) can be made from discarded tires commonly<br>
available at waste disposal facilities. RCR can be made available by type and mesh<br>
size.<br>
My invention requires two specific types of RCR. The first type is made from<br>
vulcanized rubber. The primary source for vulcanized rubber is from automobile<br>
and truck tires. The primary source for the second type is from tires classified as<br>
natural rubber or rubber which has been de-vulcanized. Natural rubber tires are<br>
mostly off-the-road (OTR) tires, which have less sulfur and zinc content than<br>
vulcanized rubber, and have a lower melting point. It is to be understood that there<br>
may exist some vulcanized rubber in natural rubber tires. However, the tire<br>
industry recognizes this fact and the "natural rubber tire" designation is understood<br>
to include some small percentage of vulcanized rubber.<br>
Air pollution is not a concern during the process. The preferred milling and<br>
extrusion temperature is between 290-310 degrees F (143-154 deg C). At this<br>
temperature range, there are no significant amounts of toxic or hazardous gases<br>
escaping into the production area or environment. Waste tires and rubber crumbs<br>
are not generally classified as hazardous materials; but rather as a waste<br>
management disposal problem.<br>
Besides discarded rubber, small additions of polymers may be used in the<br>
manufacturing process for strength enhancement. The amount necessary will be<br>
dependent upon the actual rubber composition used to form a Tie according to my<br>
invention.<br>
It is also possible to produce a rubber railroad crosstie which, in addition to the<br>
rubber mentioned above, utilizes the fiber also found in vehicular tires. In other<br>
words, a crosstie may be formed using discarded automobile tires provided the<br>
steel has been removed.<br>
The Tie can be made by either a compression mold or an extrusion process. The<br>
operating pressure for extrusion is dependent upon several factors including the<br>
viscosity, screw speed and orifice size. In general, an extrusion process operating<br>
between 240 - 370 degrees F (116-188 deg C) should operate in a pressure range of<br>
between 250-2,500 psi (1,724-17,240 kPa). Due to the logistical problems<br>
associated with a high volume compression mold process, it is more preferable to<br>
utilize a continuous extrusion process.<br>
Once formed, the color of the Tie is black. Over time, the surface will oxidize and<br>
may turn to an ashen black or gray. Testing has indicated that the Tie is not subject<br>
to the level of cracking and product degradation under sunlight as occurs for rubber<br>
tires.<br>
My railroad tie is made completely from non-conductive materials. Therefore, no<br>
special precautions are necessary as with other ties partially made from metals and<br>
which could conduct electricity.<br>
Ties can be manufactured into any length desired and are recyclable.<br>
Creosote, a known carcinogen commonly used in the manufacture of wooden<br>
railroad crossties, is not used in the manufacture of the Tie.<br>
The weight of the Tie made according to the invention is, on average, between<br>
13% to 50% less per unit when compared to other railroad tie alternatives to wood.<br>
By way of example, for a standard railroad crosstie measuring 8 . 5 f t x 9 i n x 7 i n<br>
(259 cm x 23 cm x 18 cm), a crosstie made according to the invention would weigh<br>
approximately 278 pounds (126 kg), while one made from concrete would weigh<br>
over 500 pounds (227 kg).<br>
A key feature of the Tie is that it can withstand a 120,000 pound (54,480 kg)<br>
compression test upon an area equivalent to a standard railroad tie plate of approx<br>
96 square inches (619 sq. cm) Additionally, after the load was removed, no<br>
permanent deformation was visible.<br>
The Tie is expected to have a useful life of between 30 to 60 years. The longevity<br>
of the Tie will reduce the frequency of crosstie replacement as well as the<br>
associated cost for installation.<br>
The Tie can be installed side-by-side a wooden railroad tie. This is in contrast to<br>
cement ties and other known alternative crossties where it is recommended that<br>
whole-lines be replaced even though only some ties require replacement.<br>
The Tie is designed for attachment in the same way as wood ties. The preferred<br>
method is by use of spikes while clips or screws could be used alternatively. The<br>
type of attachment would depend on railroad industry preferences for the specific<br>
locale in which the track is laid. No new placement or replacement technologies or<br>
techniques are required.<br>
Because the Tie is compressed upon formation, further compressive deformation<br>
following installation will be minimal. This will permit true alignment during<br>
installation. Other crosstie products, including those made from softwoods, have<br>
allowances for compression over time to fit the standard rail attachment plates as<br>
needed and to grip the gravel under-base or bed.<br>
An optional and unique feature is that the Tie can be made with at least one side<br>
having a plurality of indentations or indented surfaces. As used in this<br>
specification, "indented surface" and "indentation" have the same meaning and are<br>
defined here as a non-flat surface. When a plurality of indentations are present on<br>
at least one longitudinal side of a crosstie, they collectively are capable of<br>
frictionally engaging a bed of gravel better than if the longitudinal side were a flat<br>
surface. The indentations must be something more than microscopic deformations<br>
which are present on any flat surface; they must be capable of factional<br>
engagement with a gravel bed to prevent the crosstie from slipping or sliding as<br>
would be the case if the surface were flat. "Indentation" is also defined to include<br>
configurations such as ribs, serrations, dimples, and other simple geometric shapes<br>
such as diamonds and pyramids which can be indented into the crosstie.<br>
In order to function properly, the indentations must be of sufficient width to permit<br>
gravel to enter the concave area. If the indented width were too small, excessive<br>
void spaces would form in the concave area and therefore not efficiently<br>
frictionally, engage the gravel bed.<br>
The decision of whether to incorporate indented surfaces would depend upon the<br>
use of the Tie. By way of example, if the Tie were used in high speed rail lines, a<br>
gravel bed is not used but rather the crossties are positioned on a hardened surface<br>
such as cement. A crosstie having indentations is undesirable in this situation since<br>
it would reduce the surface area in contact with the hardened surface thereby<br>
reducing frictional engagement.<br>
Where gravel beds are to be used, preferably, one side of the Tie has a plurality of<br>
indentations which would face downward when laid. Most preferably, three<br>
longitudinal sides of the Tie would utilize indented surfaces. The longitudinal side<br>
facing upward when laid need not.<br>
The purpose of having indentations on the Tie is to allow it to better frictionally<br>
engage the gravel bed into which it is placed. The depth of each indentation should<br>
be limited so as to not affect the structural properties of the Tie; namely, the ability<br>
to resist compressive loads.<br>
The indented surfaces will enable the crosstie to resist sliding in the gravel bed as<br>
can be the case when aligning crossties having harder and smoother surfaces such<br>
as those made from wood, plastic or cement.<br>
The indentations can be formed while the Tie is still hot and receptive to<br>
deformation. Alternatively, a Tie which is compression molded can have ribbed<br>
sides integrated as part of the mold pattern. Still another way for creating the<br>
indentations would be by machining; however this procedure would be expensive<br>
in view of the other methods previously discussed.<br>
By way of example, the mechanical properties of a Tie made according to the<br>
invention are as follows:<br>
Density: 74.8 lbs/ft3 (1200 kg/m3)<br>
Thermal expansion coefficient: 0.005% per deg F (0.003% per deg C)<br>
Modulus of rupture: 26,982 psi (186,041 kPa)<br>
Modulus of elasticity (bending): 6,717,000 psi (46,313,715 kPa)<br>
Modulus of elasticity (compression): 174,144 psi (1,200,723 kPa)<br>
Limit of elasticity: 487,584 psi (3,361,892 kPa)<br>
Hardness: 9241bs/in (165 kg/cm)<br>
Pressure to insert spike: 4,200 psi (28,959 kPa)<br>
Pressure to withdraw spike: 3,360 psi (23,167kPa)<br>
Life expectancy: 30-60 years<br>
Weight load capacity (per Tie): 521,000 Ibs (236,534 kg)<br>
Given that extrusion will yield a crosstie with the above mechanical properties,<br>
other applications are possible for this sort of extruded rubber product. By way of<br>
example, a crosstie pad, made according to the process described herein, could be<br>
positioned between a crosstie and its underbed for train travel noise reduction, and<br>
shock absorbency when used in conjunction with either steel, cement or concrete<br>
crosstie.<br>
5. Brief Description of Drawings<br>
The details of the invention will be described in connection with the accompanying<br>
drawings in which Fig. 1 is an overall process flowchart for the manufacture of a<br>
rubber crosstie; Fig. 2 is a perspective view of an installed crosstie, made<br>
according to the invention; Fig. 3 is a perspective view of a portion of a crosstie<br>
made according to the invention having pyramid indentations along at least one<br>
longitudinal side and Fig. 4 is a perspective view of a portion of a crosstie, having<br>
an alternative type of indentation, namely a plurality of ribs.<br>
6. Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
Fig. 1 is a flowchart representing the preferred process for manufacturing a rubber<br>
railroad crosstie. The preferred method of producing a rubber crosstie is by<br>
extrusion.<br>
RCR is either made on-site from readily available tire stockpiles or is provided<br>
from an off-site source. The technology for reducing tires to rubber crumb is<br>
described, as previously mentioned, in the US Patents issued to Murray and Miller<br>
et al. The required RCR size should be no larger than 30 mesh (590 micron). RCR<br>
made from both natural rubber and vulcanized rubber is required and are stored<br>
separately and identified in Fig. 1 as 20 and 30 respectively.<br>
The mesh size is vital to the cohesive properties of the tie. A smaller mesh size<br>
enables uniform heating and a stronger bond due to each particle having a larger<br>
surface area. Natural rubber has a lower melting point and is more adhesive than<br>
vulcanized rubber and it is this natural rubber portion which provides the adhesive<br>
quality necessary to mill and extrude the Tie. It is however possible to have a small<br>
portion of the overall blend be of a larger size than 30 mesh (590 micron). Small<br>
quantities of larger size particles may exhibit acceptable performance<br>
characteristics.<br>
Referring to Fig. 1, the RCR made from natural rubber and vulcanized rubber is<br>
blended together in a mixer 50 at a weight ratio of about between 10-35% natural<br>
rubber to 65-90% vulcanized rubber. Mixer 50 can be a batch mixer or a<br>
continuous flow mixer. Preferably, a continuous flow Banbury mixer is used.<br>
An appropriate amount of polymer is added to mixer 50 from polymer tank 40, if<br>
necessary, to achieve a desired adhesive consistency. Polymer is preferably added<br>
by spray and the amount to add to the rubber blend should not exceed 0.25% to<br>
0.50% of the total weight. Appropriate polymer additives can include neoprene,<br>
polyethylene, urethane and ABS.<br>
The amount of polymer to be added is dependent upon periodic testing.<br>
Specifically, representative samples of natural rubber crumbs and vulcanized<br>
rubber crumbs which are to be made into crossties are periodically mixed at<br>
between 240-370 degrees F (116-188 deg C) and formed into an ingot by using a<br>
compression mold. Once sufficiently cooled, the ingot is subjected to a<br>
compression test. As an example, ingots have been cooled to a surface temperature<br>
of 100 deg F (57 deg C) before the test. If the test obtains a value below 6,800 psi<br>
(46,886 kPa), then additional natural crumb rubber is added to the blend. However,<br>
if the percentage of natural crumb rubber is near 35% and the compression test is<br>
below 6,800 psi (46,886 kPa), then polymer is added. The addition of polymer is<br>
preferably only used as a last resort to obtain the desired compression strength;<br>
mainly due to its high cost.<br>
Since this process is utilizing recycled rubber, it is not feasible to obtain an<br>
accurate chemical composition of the feedstock. In other words, a facility which<br>
processes discarded tires into RCR will be shredding thousands of tires made in<br>
different years by dozens of tire manufacturers. A practical way to ensure that the<br>
proper RCR blend for extruding my Tie is to perform the periodic compression<br>
testing mentioned above.<br>
The actual process for manufacturing crossties according to my invention is as<br>
follows:<br>
Subsequent to the blending in mixer 50, the rubber crumb blend, including<br>
polymer if necessary, undergoes a milling process 60 using preferably a roller mill<br>
which heats the rubber blend to between 240-370 degrees F (116-188 deg C) and<br>
compresses the heated mixture into strips to form feedstock for the extrusion step<br>
to be discussed shortly. Most preferably, the temperature is held between 290-310<br>
degrees F (143-154 C).<br>
Milling process 60 is followed by extrusion 70. Depending upon the relative<br>
outputs between milling 60 and extrusion 70, the milled product may be placed in<br>
storage 65 for a short period of time before extrusion.<br>
During extrusion 70, the temperature is preferably maintained within the same<br>
range mentioned above for the milling process. The desired pressure range for<br>
extrusion is between 250 to 750 psi (1,724-5,171 kPa). Screw type extruders are<br>
preferred.<br>
A die is selected which will provide an extrudate having the desired width and<br>
height for the Tie product. As the product exits the extrusion process, 70, it has the<br>
desired height and width and is cut to the desired length of crosstie.<br>
No special quenching is required and the rubber crosstie can be cooled/cured 80 by<br>
ambient temperature. After the Ties have been cooled, they are ready for storage<br>
and shipping. A problem may occur if the rubber crossties are immediately<br>
exposed to ambient conditions which are at or below 32 degrees F (0 deg C). The<br>
physical properties, specifically compression strength, may be jeopardized if the<br>
Tie is cooled too quickly. Therefore, gradual cooling may be required if outside<br>
conditions are excessively cold and this cooling may require the use of a heated<br>
room.<br>
A recommended approach is to place extruded Ties into a curing room 80 or area<br>
for a period of time such as between one to four hours. This will permit the Ties to<br>
cool at a slow rate and the heat dissipated by the Ties will actually heat the room;<br>
particularly when cold conditions are present outside. When the Ties reach a<br>
temperature of below 150 degrees F (66 deg C), they can be moved for storage or<br>
transport.<br>
The extrusion process can be adapted to indent or deform the longitudinal sides of<br>
the product so as to produce a crosstie 90 having a plurality of indentations such as<br>
the ribbed sides 97 illustrated in Fig. 4. Alternatively, Fig. 3 is a partial view of<br>
crosstie 90 having pyramid indentations 95. The indented surfaces can be made by<br>
machine cut. However, the indentations can be formed into crosstie 90 while it is<br>
still deformable. Preferably, as part of the extrusion step, at least one offset roller<br>
(not shown) can be used to form the plurality of indentations such as serrations or<br>
dimples into the crosstie. Indentations can be formed three sides; namely the side<br>
which will become the bottom side when the crosstie is installed as well as the two<br>
adjacent longitudinal sidewalls.<br>
The plurality of indented surfaces provide improved frictional engagement with a<br>
gravel bed during crosstie installation thereby avoiding the inherent difficulties of<br>
slipping or sliding upon the gravel bed which occur with other crossties during<br>
positioning and alignment. Frictional engagement is not necessary for the topside<br>
and may hamper proper attachment of the plate to the tie. Therefore, indentations<br>
are not recommended for the topside. Fig. 2 illustrates a final installed position for<br>
a crosstie 90.<br><br><br><br><br>
