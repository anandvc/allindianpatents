SPECIFICATION<br>
PROCESS FOR PRODUCING {DI0X0LEN0N-4-yL)METHYL ESTER DERIVATIVE<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD.<br>
This invention relates to a process by which {dioxolenon-4-yl)methyl ester derivatives useful as medicines, agrichemicals, etc, can be produced in industrial scale advantageously. Prior Art:<br>
Heretofore, compounds represented by formula (4)<br><br>
(where R' represents a hydrogen atom or an optionally substituted alkyl group, etc., and X' represents a halogen atom) have commonly been used as the starting material in a process by which compounds having a carboxyl group in the molecule (hereunder referred to as "carboxylic acids") are treated to have the carboxyl group converted to a (dioxolenon-4-yl)methyl ester.<br>
An exemplary method currently known to be used in converting the carboxyl group in carboxylic acids to a (dioxolenon-4-yl)methyl ester is by employing 4-bromomethyl-5-methyldioxolenone as set forth below (see, for example, USP 4,448,732):<br><br><br>
Using the highly reactive 4-bromomethyldioxolenone compound, the method produces the desired compound in comparatively high yield.  However, this approach of using the 4-bromomethyl compound is not very advantageous for industrial<br>
mass production since the 4-bromomethyldioxolenone compound has poor chemical stability and is comparatively high in cost.<br>
On the other hand, a 4-chloromethyldioxolenone compound is known to be more chemically stable than the 4-bromomethyldioxolenone compound and also easy to obtain. However, even if this compound is subjected to reaction under the same conditions as when the 4-bromomethyldioxolenone compound is reacted, efficient conversion to a (dioxolenon-4-yl)methyl ester cannot be realized-<br>
The present invention has been accomplished under these circumstances and has as an object providing a process by which various compounds having a carboxyl group in the molecule can be treated to have the carboxyl group converted to a (dioxolenon-4-yl)methyl ester in a simple way and at high yield using the 4-chloromethyldioxolenone<br><br>
compound.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE TNVENTTOM.<br>
To attain the stated object, the present inventors conducted intensive studies and found that the reaction for conversion to a (dioxolenon-4-yl)methyl ester proceeded efficiently by reacting a carboxyllc acid of formula (1) with a 4-chloroinethyldioxolenone compound of formula (2) in a suitable solvent in the presence of both a phase transfer catalyst and a metal iodide.  The present invention has been accomplished on the basis of this finding.<br>
Thus, according to a first aspect of the invention, there is provided a process for producing a (dioxolenon-4-yl)methyl ester derivative of formula (3)<br><br>
(where Q represents an organic group, and R^ and Rj each independently represent a hydrogen atom, an optionally substituted C1-6 alkyl group or an optionally substituted phenyl group, provided that R1 and R2 may combine to form an optionally substituted ring having 3-8 carbon atoms) by reacting a carboxylic acid of formula (1)<br><br><br>
(where Q has the same meaning as defined above, M represents a hydrogen atom, an alkali metal, an alkaline earth metal or a transition metal, and n represents the atomic valency of M) with a 4-chloromethyldioxolenone compound of formula (2)<br><br>
(where R1 and R2 have the same meanings as defined above) in a solvent in the presence of both a phase transfer catalyst and a metal iodide.<br>
According to a second aspect of the invention, there is provided a process for producing a (dioxolenon-4-yl)methyl ester derivative of formula (3)<br><br><br>
(where Q represents an organic group, and R1 and R2 each Independently represent a hydrogen atom, an optionally substituted C1-6 alkyl group or an optionally substituted phenyl group, provided that R1 and R2 may combine to form an optionally substituted ring having 3-8 carbon atoms) by reacting a carboxylic acid of formula (5)<br><br>
(where Q has the same meaning as defined above) with a 4-chloromethyldioxolenone compound of formula (2)<br><br><br>
(where R1 and R2 have the same meanings as defined above) in a solvent in the presence of both a quaternary ammonium hydroxide of the formula: RARcRdNOH (where Ra-Rd each independently represent a C1-20 alkyl group or a C7-20 aralkyl group) and a metal iodide.<br>
In the invention, a polar solvent is preferably used as said solvent.<br>
In the invention, said metal iodide is preferably used in an amount of 5-20 mol% of the 4-<br>
chloromethyldioxolenone compound of said formula (2) and it is also preferred to use an alkali metal iodide as said metal iodide*<br>
Further in the invention, a quaternary ammonium salt is preferably used as said phase transfer catalyst and it is more preferred to use a benzyltrialkylammonium halide.<br>
The invention can be applied with particular preference in a case of producing a compound among the (dioxolenon-4-yl)methyl ester derivatives of said formula (3) In which said Q is a fused heterocyclic group having a<br>
β-lactam ring.<br>
It is also preferred in the invention that a base is<br>
further added at least in an amount corresponding to the<br>
amount of acidic impurities contained in the 4-<br>
chloromethyldioxolenone compound used which is represented<br>
by said formula (2).<br>
It is also preferred in the invention that the<br>
reaction is performed by elevating the reaction temperature<br>
through a plurality of stages, and more preferably the<br><br>
reaction is performed by elevating the reaction temperature in two stages, the first stage at 40°C or below and the second stage at 50°C or above.<br>
In the invention, the 4-chloromethyldioxolenone compound which features comparatively high chemical stability and easy availability is used, and it is characterized by adding a phase transfer catalyst and a metal iodide to the reaction system.  According to the invention, the carboxyl group can be converted to a (dioxolenon-4-yl)methyl ester in a simple way and at high yield.<br>

These iodides may be used either alone or in admixture of two or more kinds as exemplified by potassium iodide/iodine and sodium iodide/iodine.<br>
Among those, the use of alkali metal iodides is preferred from the viewpoints of easy availability, production cost, and high yield at which the desired product can be obtained.<br>
The iodides are typically used in amounts of 0.1 to 40 mol%, preferably in the range of 5-20 mol%, relative to the compound of formula (1)• 4) Phase transfer catalyst<br>
In the present invention, a phase transfer catalyst is employed in addition to said metal iodide.  A phase transfer catalyst is added to ensure smooth progress of the<br>
reaction.<br>
As the phase transfer catalyst, quaternary ammonium salts, phosphonium salts, crown ethers and so forth are employed-  Exemplary quaternary ammonium salts include: tetraalkylammonium chlorides such as tetramethylammonium chloride, tetraethylammonium chloride, tetrapropylammonium, chloride and tetrabutylammonium chloride (TBAC); tetraalkylammonioum bromides such as tetramethylammonium<br><br>

Specific examples include: ether-based solvents such as diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran (THF), 1,2-diomethoxyethane and 1,4-dioxane; halogen-based solvents such as dichloromethane, chloroform, trichloromethane, carbon tetrachloride and 1,2-dichloroethane; nitrile-based solvents such as acetonitrile and benzonitrile; phosphoric amide-based solvents such as hexamethylphosphoric triamide; amide-based solvents such as N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), N,N*dimethylacetamide, 1,3-dimethylimidazolidine, 1,3-dimethyl-2-imidazolidinone and N-methylpyrrolidone; ketone-based solvents such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone and cyclohexanone; alcohol-based solvents such as methanol, ethanol, n-propanol and isopropanol; ester-based solvents such as methyl acetate, ethyl acetate and n-propyl acetate; polar solvents such as dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and water.  These solvents can be used either alone or in admixture of two or more kinds.<br>
Among these, the use of polar organic solvents is<br><br>
preferred since upon addition of water, the reaction mixture separates into layers, making it possible to wash the reaction mixture with water; the use of THF, DMF, DMSO or acetone is more preferred, and the use of THF is particularly preferred. 6) Base<br>
In the present invention, if M in said formula (1) is a hydrogen atom (i.e. in the case of a carboxylic acid), a base is preferably added to the reaction system.  Examples of useful bases include: alkali metal hydroxides such as sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide; alkaline earth metal hydroxides such as magnesium hydroxide and calcium hydroxide; alkali metal carbonates such as sodium carbonate and potassium carbonate; alkali metal hydrogencarbonates such as sodium hydrogencarbonate and potassium hydrogencarbonate; alkaline earth metal carbonates such as magnesium carbonate and calcium carbonate; metal hydrides such as sodium hydride and calcium hydride; metal alkoxides such as sodium methoxide, sodium ethoxide, potassium t-butoxide, magnesium methoxide and magnesium ethoxide; organic bases such as triethylamine, diisopropylethylamine, pyridine, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2,2,2]octane, 4-dimethylaminopyridine, 1,4-diazabicyclo[5,4,0]und-7-ene, n-butyllithiura and lithium diisopropylamide; quaternary ammonium hydroxides represented by the formula: RaRbRcRdNOH,<br>
Among those, the use of quaternary ammonium hydroxides represented by the formula: RaRbRcRaNOH is particularly preferred since they serve the role of the<br><br>
base and the phase transfer catalyst.<br>
Said Ra-Rd each Independently represent C1-20 alkyl groups such as methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl, t-butyl, n-pentyl, neopentyl, n-hexyl, n-heptyl, n-octyl, n-nonyl, n-decyl, n-dodecyl and n-cetyl groups; or C7-20 aralkyl groups such as benzyl, 3-chlorobenzyl, 4-methylbenzyl, 2-methoxybenzyl, a-methylbenzyl, 2-phenylethyl, 3-phenylpropyl and 4-phenyl-n-butyl groups-<br>
Specific examples of the quaternary ammonium hydroxide represented by said formula: RaRbRcRdNOH include: tetraalkylammonium hydroxides such as tetramethylammonium hydroxide, tetraethylammonium hydroxide, tetrapropylammonium hydroxide and tetrabutylammonium hydroxide; benzyltrialkyl hydroxides such as benzyltrimethylammonium hydroxide, benzyltrimethylammonium hydroxide, benzyltri-n-butyloammonium hydroxide and benzyl-tri-n-butyloammonium hydroxide.<br>
The base is used typically in amounts ranging from 1 mole to 3 moles per mole of the compound of formula (1).<br>
The 4-chloromethyldioxolenone compound represented by said formula (2) is relatively stable compared to the 4-bromomethyldioxolenone compound but if it is used industrially in large volumes, part of it will decompose, sometimes coming to contain acidic impurities.  Therefore, in the present invention, in order to neutralize the acidic impurities contained in the 4-chloromethyldioxolenone compound represented by said formula (2) which is used in<br><br>
the reaction. It is preferred to further add a base to the reaction mixture at least in an amount corresponding to the amount of said acidic impurities.<br>
Exemplary bases that can be used here include: alkali metal hydroxides such as sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide; alkaline earth metal hydroxides such as magnesium hydroxide and calcium hydroxide; alkali metal carbonates such as sodium carbonate and potassium carbonate; alkaline earth metal carbonates such as magnesium carbonate and calcium carbonate; hydrogencarbonates such as sodium hydrogencarbonate and potassium hydrogencarbonate; organic bases such as triethylamine and pyridine.<br>
The reaction temperature for use in the production method of the invention is not limited to any particular value as long as it is within the temperature range where the compounds of formulas {1) and (2) or the compound of formula (3), which is the product, will not be decomposed in the reaction system using the above-mentioned reagents. A typical reaction temperature is 80°C or less and it is preferred to perform the reaction at 60°C or less.<br>
If the compound of formula (1) has reactive points other than the carboxylic acid residue that react with formula (2) and if the reaction temperature is set on the higher side of the above-mentioned temperature range in consideration of the reaction efficiency, the progress of esterification is sometimes accompanied by simultaneous formation of by-products as the result of reaction at those<br><br>
other reaction points.  Considering the drop in the yield of reaction and the increase in the complexity of separation steps due to increased impurities, it is preferable from an industrial point of view to minimize the formation of by-products.  Thus, it is preferable to elevate the reaction temperature through a plurality of stages.  Specifically, the reaction is first performed for a given time at low temperature, which is later elevated to a higher temperature where the reaction is further carried out for a certain period of time, whereby the reaction efficiency can be enhanced while suppressing the generation of by-products.  Stated more specifically, the reaction temperature is elevated in two stages, the first stage<br>
being at 40°C or less and the second stage at 50°C or more. Particularly in the case where Q in formula (1) is a fused<br>
heterocyclic group having a β-lactam ring which is the basic skeleton of β-lactam antimicrobial agents, the reaction temperature is preferably controlled as described<br>
above.<br>
After the end of the reaction, the desired product can be obtained by performing isolation and purification in accordance with ordinary techniques in organic synthetic chemistry.  The structure of the desired product can be determined by, for example, measuring various spectrums including 1H-NMR, IR and MASS spectrums.<br>
