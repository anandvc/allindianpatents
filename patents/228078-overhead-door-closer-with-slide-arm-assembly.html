				<td>Title:	Overhead door closer with slide arm<br>
assembly<br>
Description<br>
This invention relates to an overhead door closer with slide<br>
arm assembly, having a piston being guided in a housing<br>
and leaning against a closing spring, having a toothed<br>
pinion being eccentrically, rotatably supported at the<br>
housing and meshing with a toothed rack of the piston,<br>
which pinion presents a circular rolling curve, the central<br>
point thereof being offset, in relation to the rotary axis of<br>
the pinion in the closing position, into the direction towards<br>
the toothed rack, and in relation to the rotary axis in the<br>
opening position, into the opposite direction.<br>
The above described overhead door closers with slide.arm<br>
assembly, also known as rack and pinion door closers, with<br>
regard to traditional door closers, advantageously do not<br>
present an arm assembly protruding uncovered into the<br>
room, but they simply present an actuation arm sitting<br>
close and flat at the door frame or at the door leaf. They<br>
do, however, bear the disadvantage that the actuation arm,<br>
sitting close and flat at the door frame or at the door leaf,<br>
leads to an unfavourable course of forces at the door, in<br>
relation with conventional, symmetric rack and pinion<br>
mechanics. It is therefore an object to conceive an optimal<br>
rack and pinion drive, with the intention to achieve, during<br><br>
the opening procedure and closing procedure of the door,<br>
an operation of the pinion, as low in friction and smooth as<br>
possible, at the associated toothed rack and therefore of<br>
the piston inside the piston housing.<br>
Centrically or eccentrically supported pinions are used in<br>
known door closers.<br>
A door closer species, described at the beginning, having<br>
an eccentrically supported pinion is known from EP 0 856<br>
628 A1, wherein the toothing of the toothed rack forms a<br>
linearly extending pitch line of engagement having an angle<br>
comprised between 4.5° and 7.2° with regard to the moving<br>
direction of the piston. The selection of an angle depends<br>
on the size of the door closer, respectively on the strength<br>
of the closing spring. Because of the eccentric support of<br>
the pinion and of the linear course of the toothed rack, an<br>
optimal, especially low friction and smooth progress of the<br>
pinion's teeth at the toothed rack is not guaranteed; there<br>
are spreads in the course of the momentums' curves.<br>
A comparable solution applying a linearly extending<br>
toothed rack with an angle is described in U.S. Patent No.<br>
633,682.<br>
Furthermore DE 36 45 313 C2 and DE 36 45 314 C2<br>
reveal an eccentrically supported pinion where a rolling<br>
curve, arranged at the pinion, is used, having various lever<br><br>
arms in relation to the rotary axis. Accordingly, the rolling<br>
curve of the associated toothed rack extends in an arcuate<br>
form.<br>
In a door closer known from DE 82 17 72 C2 respectively<br>
from the French Patent Application 96 69 45, the closer<br>
shaft is connected at an eccentrically supported elliptical<br>
toothed wheel meshing with an inclined toothed rack on the<br>
piston side. Up to a certain degree, a transmission,<br>
adapted to a desired course of the momentum, is achieved<br>
by means of the elliptical gear due to the differently long<br>
lever arms of the elliptical toothed wheel.<br>
The pneumatic door closer according to U.S. Patent<br>
1,359,144 presents a circular eccentrically supported<br>
pinion which meshes with an uneven toothed rack at the<br>
piston. The circular pinion is provided with a regular<br>
toothing on a circular rolling curve, whereby varying lever<br>
arms come into effect due to the eccentrical support.<br>
Various piston drive embodiments in door closers are<br>
described in DE 36 38 353 A1, in EP 0 207 251 A2, in DE<br>
94 12 64 and in US 2,933,755, whereby in relation with<br>
eccentrically or centrically supported pinions - if necessary<br>
with insertion of a transmitting gear drive - a direct charge<br>
of the closing spring is exerted by means of a crank drive.<br><br>
Centrically supported pinions are known from EP 0 056<br>
256 A2 as well as from EP 0 350 568 A2. EP 0 056 256 A2<br>
deals with a door closer, the pistons thereof presenting two,<br>
symmetrically, diametrically opposite toothed racks,<br>
whereby a centrically supported pinion engages, in the<br>
closing position, with shortened teeth, in both toothed racks<br>
of the piston.<br>
The door closer according to EP 0 350 568 A2 presents a<br>
centrically supported pinion, which presents teeth<br>
extending at the circumference, with progressively<br>
increasing depths of teeth, which teeth engage between<br>
the rods of a correspondingly curve-shaped extending<br>
toothed rack.<br>
A substantially centrically supported pinion of a drive for a<br>
door or for a window is disclosed in DE 44 44 131 A1 and<br>
DE 44 44 133 A1, wherein the pinion itself presents a<br>
toothing over up to approximately half the circumference<br>
thereof, the teeth thereof being disposed at lever arms<br>
varying in length and progressing on a correspondingly<br>
curved rolling curve of a toothed rack.<br>
The object of the invention is to optimize, within the door<br>
closer housing, the progression of movements of the piston<br>
of the overhead door closer with slide arm assembly during<br>
the opening procedure and the closing procedure, i.e. to<br>
guarantee especially a jam-free and therefore low friction<br><br>
progression of the pinion at the toothed rack of the piston.<br>
By using a pinion having an appropriate rolling curve, the<br>
pinion's cost of production should be minimized, whereby,<br>
compared to known toothed rks, a particular embodiment<br>
of the toothed rack, due to the intended low friction to be<br>
achieved, should result in a longer lasting working life and<br>
in higher efficiency, which in return allows for using a<br>
weaker closing spring. In execution of the invention an<br>
improvement of the closing characteristics of the overhead<br>
door closer with slide arm assembly should be achieved<br>
additionally through an improved oil exchange from the<br>
piston chamber to the spring chamber during the closing<br>
procedure.<br>
The invention solves the given problem with the teaching<br>
according to the claims 1, 3, and 4.<br>
According to the invention, a toothed rack, respectively the<br>
teeth thereof are adapted in an optimal way to the<br>
progression of a toothing of a pinion, while taking into<br>
account its eccentrical support and its circular rolling curve,<br>
such that a smooth transition to each following adjacent<br>
tooth is guaranteed, during the opening procedure as well<br>
as during the closing procedure. This applies particularly to<br>
the portion of the pinion exceeding the rotation of 180°. In<br>
this case, it has proven to be advantageous that the<br>
opening-sided teeth's flank angle of the toothed rack be<br>
executed substantially in ascending manner up to<br><br>
approximately half the length of the toothed rack, and<br>
subsequently they be executed substantially in a constant<br>
or descending manner, whereby the descending course<br>
contributes to improving the low friction.<br>
The rotation of the pinion, from the closing position up to<br>
the maximum opening position, may comprise more or less<br>
than approximately 180°, without having any negative<br>
influence on the required effectiveness. It is essential that<br>
the closing-sided tooth profiles of the last teeth of the<br>
toothed rack in the opening direction, arranged in the<br>
portion adjoining the 180°, be executed with an angle or<br>
rounded.<br>
Further characteristics of the invention are characterized by<br>
the sub-claims.<br>
In execution of the invention basically optional tooth forms<br>
may be used; i.e. the pinion and/or the toothed rack may<br>
present teeth with straight, angled or convex curved tooth<br>
profiles. However, it has proven to be advantageous -<br>
especially for reasons regarding production techniques - to<br>
attribute substantially a spur toothing to the toothed rack<br>
and an involute toothing to the pinion.<br>
The invention includes furthermore an improvement of the<br>
closing characteristics through the improved oil exchange.<br><br>
Accordingly, the closing procedure comprises four closing<br>
phases, each closing phase, while including a certain<br>
tolerance, being associated in an already known manner to<br>
one closing angle. The first closing phase, as well as the<br>
third one, may be controlled through a single valve by<br>
means of the longitudinal groove that is arranged in the<br>
skirt of the piston such that the low friction course of the<br>
pinion at the toothed rack, attainable with the<br>
characteristics a) to d), is assisted by an advantageous<br>
embodiment of the oil exchange between the piston<br>
chamber and the spring chamber during the closing<br>
procedure, whereby it is not necessary to use a commonly<br>
required valve for the third closing phase.<br>
The invention will be explained in detail on the basis of a<br>
diagrammatically represented possible embodiment<br>
example, in which<br>
Figure 1	shows a vertical section through a door<br>
closer housing.<br>
Figure 2	shows a section following line A-A<br>
according to Figure 1.<br>
Figure 3	shows a plane view on the piston<br>
including two end positions of the pinion.<br><br>
Figures 4 to 6 show three phases of the pinion's course<br>
at a toothed rack.<br>
Figures 7 to 10 show in a diagrammatical illustration,<br>
four positions of the piston during the<br>
delayed closing operation.<br>
Figure 11	shows a second embodiment of the<br>
delayed closing operation.<br>
According to Figures 1 to 6, a closing spring 3 acts on a<br>
piston 4 which is guided in a housing 2 of an overhead<br>
door closer with slide arm assembly 1. As illustrated in<br>
Figures 2 and 3, the piston 4 has a toothed rack 5 meshing<br>
with a pinion 6, which presents an involute toothing 7. In<br>
the region of the center longitudinal axis referenced to with<br>
numeral 23, the pinion 6 is eccentrically supported in the<br>
rotary axis referenced to with D, whereby in the closing<br>
position of pinion 6, illustrated in Figure 3, a central point M<br>
of the rolling circle of pinion 6 is offset into the direction<br>
towards the toothed rack 5, and in the opening position,<br>
illustrated in Figure 3, the central point M of the rolling<br>
circle of pinion 6 is offset into the opposite direction- The<br>
rolling curve of pinion 6, as can be seen, is circular. The<br>
teeth of toothed rack 5, generally referenced to with<br>
numeral 9, present opening-sided tooth profiles and<br>
closing-sided tooth profiles, whereby the closing-sided<br>
tooth profiles 8 (see Figure 3) of the last two teeth 9 are<br><br>
executed with an angle. The tooth profiles of all the other<br>
teeth 9 present a straight course. The afore-mentioned<br>
measure guarantees that during a movement of piston 4 in<br>
the direction of arrow X (opening direction) when the pinion<br>
6 progresses on the toothed rack 5, even in the region, in<br>
which the pinion 6 has slightly exceeded the rotation about<br>
180° (see closing position of the pinion 6 in Figure 3), a low<br>
friction mating of the involute toothing 7 with the teeth 9 of<br>
toothed rack 5 is realised. By the way, the rolling curve of<br>
the toothed rack 5 is adapted to the eccentrical support of<br>
pinion 6 and presents a correspondingly slightly S-shaped<br>
course, whereby all teeth 9 of the toothed rack 5 present<br>
different flank angles on the opening-side and on the<br>
closing-side, as can be seen in Figures 4 to 6, illustrating<br>
the pinion's progression at the toothed rack in three<br>
phases.<br>
Respectively separated positions of pinion 6 are illustrated<br>
in the Figures 4 to 6. In this case, Figure 4 illustrates the<br>
closing position, i.e. when the door is closed, namely the<br>
position of the piston 4 and of the pinion 6. In this case, the<br>
pinion 6 is located in the right zone of the aperture of piston<br>
4. In this case, the rotary axis D is located on the center<br>
longitudinal axis 23. If the piston 4 is moved into the<br>
opening direction (direction of arrow X), the pinion 6 will<br>
rotate about the rotary axis D. Due to the eccentricity of<br>
pinion 6, a position arranged almost in a central region can<br>
be seen in Figure 5, position that corresponds to a certain<br><br>
opening position of the door. Through the progression of<br>
pinion 6 at the toothed rack 5, the piston 4 has moved<br>
further into the opening direction.<br>
As especially shown in Figure 1 and in Figures 7 to 10,<br>
three control valves 11, 12, and 13, serving the delayed<br>
closing operation, are disposed in the housing walls 10 of<br>
the overhead door closer with slide arm assembly 1, and<br>
functions thereof will be explained hereinafter on the basis<br>
of Figures 7 to 10.<br>
During the start of the closing procedure according to<br>
Figure 7, the piston 4 passes an oil outlet duct 14, which,<br>
via a duct 19, is connected with a control valve 11 and via<br>
a duct 20 with a piston chamber 24. The oil exiting the<br>
piston chamber 24, via a longitudinal groove 16 in the skirt<br>
of the piston 15 and a radial borehole 17 in the piston 4,<br>
can pass over into the spring chamber 18. The ducts 25,<br>
21, and 22, associated to the control valve 12, are<br>
arranged in another plane.<br>
According to Figure 8, the longitudinal groove 16 passed<br>
the duct 14, such that an oil transfer, from the piston<br>
chamber 24 to the spring chamber 18, is only possible due<br>
to the play between the piston 5 and the wall of the housing<br>
10, resulting in a strong delay of the closing speed (second<br>
phase of the delayed closing operation).<br><br>
During the third phase of the delayed closing operation, the<br>
oil passes again from the piston chamber 24, via the duct<br>
20 and the same control valve 11 as well as the ducts 19<br>
and 14 into the region of a not specifically illustrated<br>
overflow edge of piston 4, into the spring chamber 18. As<br>
the same control valve 11 is involved, the closing speed is<br>
identical in the first and in the third delaying phase.<br>
During the fourth phase of the delayed closing operation<br>
(beginning of the closing region) the duct 20 of the valve 11<br>
leading to the piston chamber 24 is closed; in this case the<br>
oil coming from the piston chamber 24 passes, via the duct<br>
25, the control valve 12, the duct 21, and the duct 22 via<br>
the afore mentioned overflow edge, into the spring<br>
chamber 18. The control valve, referenced to with the<br>
numeral 13, is normally closed during the delayed closing<br>
operation; there is, however, the possibility of reducing the<br>
delaying period, through corresponding opening of this<br>
valve during the second closing phase (during which an oil<br>
exchange happens only through leakage between the<br>
piston and the housing walls), whereby the oil exiting the<br>
piston chamber 24 is conducted, while being reduced, via<br>
the duct 26, the control valve 13, the duct 27, and the duct<br>
28, into the spring chamber 18.<br>
An alternative embodiment with regard to the execution of<br>
the oil outlet ducts and the valves for controlling the closing<br>
procedure is illustrated in Figure 11. In this alternative<br><br>
embodiment only two different closing phases are realised,<br>
such that a modification with regard to the above described<br>
four closing phases is possible. Therefore, only the valves<br>
11 and 12 are required. The oil outlet duct 19 is extended<br>
and leads into an oil outlet duct 29 ending behind the not<br>
specifically designated overflow edge of piston 4 in the<br>
region of the toothed rack 5.<br>
Besides the above described two embodiment examples<br>
with regard to different closing phases of the connected<br>
doors, it is of course possible, within the scope of the<br>
invention, to realise a different number of closing phases<br>
having various closing speeds.<br><br>
