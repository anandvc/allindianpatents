				<td>TWO-WAY ARCHITECTURAL STRUCTURAL SYSTEM AND MODULAR SUPPORT MEMBER<br>
Technical Field<br>
This invention relates generally to a modular architectural structural system and prefabricated modular building system. More particularly, the present invention relates to a repeatable structural system that offers two-way directional strength and support for an architectural structure. Background of the Invention<br>
Steel frame architectural structures such as buildings and the like have been constructed using either welded connections or bolted fittings between beams and columns to achieve an assembly capable of bracing structures against lateral loads. In such structures, steel beams and columns are arranged and fastened together using known engineering principles and practices to form the skeletal backbone of the structure.<br>
The arrangement of the beams and columns is critical ensuring that the framework of beams and columns can support the stresses, strains and loads contemplated for the intended use of the structure. It is equally important to determine the manner in which such stresses, strains and loads are transferred from beam to beam, beam to column and column to foundation throughout the structure. Accordingly, much attention must also be given to the means by which beams and columns are connected in an architectural structure.<br>
Many traditional connectors used in structural systems are "one-way" connectors, meaning thai the connectors result in the structural components bearing or transferring loads only in a single direction. While such structures have enjoyed a great deal of success, the one-way systems do not facilitate maximum strength and support of the structure.<br>
The present invention is provided to solve these and other problems, and to provide advantages and aspects not provided by prior architectural structural systems of this type. Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention provides an architectural structural system and an overall prefabricated modular building system. The architectural structural system comprises a structural beam and a structural connector. The structural beam comprises a first c-beam and second c beam adjacently disposed one in parallel to the other.<br>
 <br>
According to another aspect of the present invention, the first and second c-beams are adjacently disposed one in parallel to the other, and are securably connected one to the other to create an I-beam. A slot is provided between the first and second c-beams to receive a connector therein.<br>
According to yet another aspect of the present invention, a structural connector for an architectural structural system is provided. The structural connector comprises a blade having opposed first and second ends and opposed faces. Alternatively, the connector comprises a plurality of transverse blades having opposed faces. One of the blades is connectedly disposed between the first and second c-beams. According to both aspects, the blades are provided to be connectedly disposed between the first and second c-beams.<br>
According to still another aspect of the present invention, another embodiment of a structural connector for an architectural structural system is provided. According to this aspect, the structural connector further includes a column adaptor. The column adaptor comprises a plurality of blades extending perpendicularly to the transverse blades proximate the juncture of the transverse blades.<br>
According to-another aspect of the present invention, a repeatable framework for an architectural structural system is provided. The repeatable framework comprises a plurality of connectors, a plurality of structural beams and a plurality of structural columns. According to this aspect of the invention each of the connectors comprises a beam adaptor and at least one column adaptor. The beam adaptor comprises a plurality of transverse blades having opposed faces. The column adaptors comprise a plurality of blades extending perpendicularly from the beam adaptor proximate the juncture of the transverse blades. Each of the structural beams comprises a pair of adjacently disposed c-beams connected at opposed ends by one the connectors. Each structural beam is in turn connected to another of the structural beams by another of the plurality of blades of a common structural connector. The columns each comprise a plurality of adjacently disposed elongated angled plates. Each column is connected at opposed ends to two of the plurality of structural beams by common connectors.<br>
According to another aspect of the present invention, the repeatable framework can be assembled in a variety of ways to achieve the completed architectural structure. Structural members many be separately brought to a site and assembled. Alternatively, structural<br>
 <br>
members may be remotely assembled in modules and subsequently transported to a desired site for construction of the architectural structure.<br>
According to another aspect of the present invention, the repeatable framework includes a plurality of apertures in the c-beams. The apertures provide raceways for HVAC, electrical and plumbing.<br>
According to another aspect of the present invention, floor and roof plates are attached to the top of the beams to provide a structural walking surface as well as concealing and, or sealing the area within the beams. Sub-floor or sub-roof plates may be attached to the beams to provide concealing and, or sealing the area within the beam.<br>
According to yet another aspect of the present invention, the repeatable modules may be sealed to create an area for forced air to be used as a plenum box. Roof fascia may be provided to edge and conceal roofing material as well as any utilities/HVAC located on roof.<br>

While the present invention is susceptible of embodiment in many different forms, there is shown in the drawings and will herein be described in detail preferred embodiments of the invention. It is to be understood that the present disclosure is to be considered as an exemplification of the principles of the invention. This disclosure is not intended to limit the broad aspects of the invention to the illustrated embodiments.<br>
The present architectural structural system results in an efficient two-way, continuous structural action of the floor and the roof framing, and consequent two-way system for prefabricated roof and floor decks. These benefits arise as a result of utilizing structural modules that are inherently adaptable to cantilevers in at least two directions with no additional material, and which are adaptable to changes in surface elevations (e.g., to conform to site topography. The present invention is generally directed to an architectural structural system defined by a repeatable modular framework. Because a repeatable system is employed, a modular structural bay 9 can be brought to a predetermined site, and the structure can be fully assembled using prefabricated modules. Alternatively, the building may be fully assembled off-site with the same prefabricated modules and subsequently transported to a desired location.<br>
As shown in FIG. 1, the repeatable framework of the present invention is a structural bay 9 comprised of a plurality of structural beamslO, columns 22 and connectors 16,16', 16". Although the structural bay according to the present invention is preferably a 21' x 21' module, a bay of any size may be employed without departing from the present invention. The structural bay 9 becomes repeatable-by securably connecting a plurality of like structural bays 9 using a series connectors 16,16', 16" that uniformly transfer loads throughout the structure from structural beams 10 to adjacent beams 10, columns 22 and eventually to the foundation 8. The components architectural structural system of the present invention will now will be described in detail.<br>
As may be seen in FIGS. 2 and 3, the structural beam 10 used in connection with the present invention is comprised of a first c-beam 12 and second c-beam 14, each c-beam 12,<br>
 <br>
14 having opposed first and second ends. As shown in FIG. 7, the first and second c-beams 12,14 are adjacently disposed one parallel to the other, and securably connected one to the other by sandwiching the c-beams 12,14 around a structural connector 16,16', 16". The c-beams 12,14 are preferably 12" deep, 1/8" thick steel plate press formed into "C" shapes, and when assembled according to the present invention, are fastened back to back to create an I-beam configuration. According to the present invention, a slot 18 is provided between the first and second c-beams 12,14 to receive a connector 16,16', 16" therein. The slot 18 provides a cantilever receptacle for receiving a portion of connector 16,16', 16"as described herein. In one embodiment of the present invention, the slot 18 may be provided by disposing a spacer 20 between the first and second c-beams 12,14. It is contemplated that the spacer 20 may be made from steel, a polymeric material or any other material suitable to maintain sufficient spacing between the c-beams 12,14 proximate their first and second ends so that a portion of a connector 16,16' may be received there between.<br>
According to the present invention, all or parts of the building system can be prewired, plumbed, and set up for HVAC with minimal connections to be attached to infrastructure framework as a "plug in" building. As seen in FIGS. 2 and 3 apertures are located in the web of the structural beams to allow for air flow, and/or raceways for electrical, HVAC, and plumbing. As discussed below, these apertures may also be uses to provide mounting points for floor plates 66 or roof plates 68.<br>
The structural columns 22 of the present invention are depicted in FIGS. 8-16. According to the present invention, each column comprises a plurality of adjacently disposed, elongated and angled plates 24. In one preferred embodiment, each column is comprised of four 3/16" thick steel plates 24 press formed into angles and connected together by a series of fasteners 36 to form a cruciform shape. These structural columns 22 provide a pathway for loads to be transferred from the roof and floor modules of the structural system and from the columns 22 to the foundation 8 upon which the structural system is ultimately connected. According to the present invention, spacers 20 or "packer plates" are also disposed between the plates 24 forming the columns 22 to provide a constant gap which enables a portion of the connectors 16 to be received by, and fastened to, the columns 22. The height of the columns 22 is preferably designed on a 2' 6" module, ranging from 2' 6" to 15'. However, it is contemplated that the columns 22 be of any suitable length without departing from the present invention.<br>
 <br>
As discussed above, the structural beams 10 and columns 22 of the overall structural framework are secured one to the other by a plurality of connectors 16,16'. The connectors 16,16' not only provide means to attach the structural components (i.e., beams to beams, beams to columns and columns to foundation), but also facilitate the transfer of loads between beams 10, from beams 10 to columns 22, from above floor columns 22 to below floor columns (not shown), and from below floor columns 22 to the foundation 8. Accordingly, the connectors 16,16' provide structural integrity to the overall structural system by providing a pathway for loads to travel from component to component. Various embodiments of connectors 16,16' suitable for use with the present invention now will be described.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention illustrated in FIG. 4, the structural connector 16<br>
comprises a blade 26 having opposed first and second ends 26a, 26b and opposed faces 32.<br>
According to the present invention, a pair of c-beams 12,14 (as described) above are<br>
connected one to the other on opposed faces 32 of the first end 26a of the blade 26. Another<br>
	pair of the c-beams 12, 14 are securably attached to opposed faces 32 of the second end of<br>
the blade 26. Alternatively, the structural connector may be configured to connect more than two beams 10 in a structure. In this case, the structural connector 16 comprises a plurality of transverse blades 26.

It is also contemplated that the apertures be detents in the surface of the marginal edge 38 of the blade 26. In such a configuration, it is contemplated that the c-beams 12, 14 include corresponding protrusions that cooperatively engage the detents to securably attach each c-beams 12,14 to the connector 16. Alternatively, the c-beams 12, 14 may be securably attached to the connectors 16 by welding.<br>
The blade 26 of the connector 16 may be configured to accommodate connection of c-beams 12,14 in either an orthogonal or non-orthogonal architectural structural system. For example, it is contemplated that the blade 26 be formed to an angle other than 90° (e.g., 60° or 45°) to accommodate a non-orthogonal architectural structural system (e.g., a triangle), or<br>
 <br>
to 90° or 180° to accommodate an orthogonal structure. Generally, the connectors 16 are made from steel having a thickness of 0.50 inches to 2.0 inches. However, it is contemplated that the connectors 16 be made from any material and of varying thickness suitable for application of a particular structural system.<br>
In another embodiment, shown in FIGS. 8-10 (and FIG. 12), the structural connector 16' further includes a beam adaptor 42 and at least one column adaptor 44. The beam adaptor 42 comprises a plurality of transverse columnar blades 46 having opposed faces 32. Each of the columnar blades 46 of the beam adaptor 42 may be connected to a separate structural beam 10. The column adaptor 44 also comprises a plurality of columnar blades 46.

As seen in FIG. 14, the columns 22 also attach to the foundational surface 8 in similar fashion as described above. The connector 16" for attaching structural columns 22 to the foundation 8 comprises a base member 50 having a top surface 52 and a plurality of transverse blades 54, extending perpendicularly from the top surface 52. The base member 50 may be bolted to the foundational surface 8 by conventional means.<br>
As shown in FIGS. 15-17, the repeatable modular framework may further be stabilized using horizontal and vertical cross bracings 56. Specifically, the cross bracings 56 provide structural stability to resist wind loads. According to the present invention, the vertical and horizontal cross bracings 56 each comprise tension rods-58 having opposed first and second ends. The first and second ends of the tension rods 58 of both the vertical horizontal are securably connected to one of the plurality of structural connectors 16,16', 16" at the roof line and floor line of adjacent structural columns 22 of the structure in an "X" configuration. According to one embodiment, the structural connectors 16,16', 16" each include a flange 60 disposed between each of plurality of transverse blades 26* to accommodate connection of the cross bracings 56.
