				<td>Euphonium Salt Initiators<br>
The invention pertains to novel sulphonium salt photoinitiators and their use in photocurable compositions.<br>
WO 03/072567 and WO 03/008404 disclose sulfonium salts, wherein the sulfonium ion is located in a condensed ring system, for example in the thioxanthyl moiety. In EP 1033624 radiation-sensitive compositions for chemically amplified photoresists comprising onium salts are described. In said compositions inter alia sulfonium salts with fluoro-alkylsulfonate anions are employed, for example 4-t-butyloxycarbonylphenyl diphenyl sulfonium 3,3,3,2,1,1-hexafluoropropane sulfonate or 4-t-butyloxycarbonylphenyl diphenyl sulfonium nonafluorobutane sulfonate.<br>
One major problem of commercially available sulfonium salt photoinitiators is the formation of toxic and/or odorous break down products like diphenyl sulfide or benzene. In technique there is a need for effective cationic photoinitiators, which are reactive, in particular in both clear and pigmented coatings, thin and thick layers, with and without the addition of sensitizers as co-initiators, non toxic and which generate non toxic and odorless break down products and which further are low-yellowing. It now has been found, that compounds of the formula I, II, III and IV<br><br><br>
or are unsubstituted naphthyl, anthryl, phenanthryl or biphenylyl;<br>
or are naphthyl, anthryl, phenanthryl or biphenylyl substituted by one or more C1-C20alkyl, OH<br>
or OR3;<br><br>
Ara    is unsubstituted phenyl, naphthyl, anthryl, phenanthryl or biphenylyl;<br>
or is phenyl, naphthyl, anthryl, phenanthryl or biphenylyl substituted by one or more Ci-<br>
C2oalkyl, OR3, C2-C12alkanoyl or benzoyl;<br>
Ar4    is phenylene, naphthylene, anthrylene or phenanthrylene;<br>
A      is a direct bond, S, O or C1-C20alkylene;<br>
X      is CO, C(0)0, 0C(0), O, S or NR3;<br>

The compounds according to the invention are characterized in that one phenyl ring located at the S-atom bears an ester substituent in ortho position to the S-atom. Said compounds excel at a good reactivity in combination with low yellowing and good solubility in the photocurable formulation.<br>
The photolatent acid sulfonium salt compounds of formula I, II, III and IV exhibit a very satisfactory reactivity combined with good solubility and low yellowing properties. A very important advantage in view of environmental aspects is the fact that the compounds according to the present invention do not release benzene.<br>
C1-C20alkyl is linear or branched and is, for example,C1-C18-, C1-C14-, C1-C12-,C1-4-, C1-C6-or C1-C4alkyl.

The compounds according to the present invention can for example be prepared by converting dithiobisbenzoic acid to its di-ester by acid-catalyzed (for example, with sulfuric acid) es-terification with an alcohol, for example, methanol, ethanol, or isopropanol. Since the starting diacid has a poor solubility in the alcohol, it may be convenient to add a co-solvent such as dioxane, tetrahydrofuran, or 1,2-dichlorobenzene. Esterification methods are well known and proceed typically at the reflux temperature of the alcohol or boiling point of the azeotrope. Water liberated in the process is typically removed by azeotropic distillation. It is also convenient to convert dithiobisbenzoic acid to its dichloride, before treatment with the alcohol to obtain the diester. Suitable chlorination methods are for example, thionyl chloride (as solvent or in nearly stoechiometric amount and diluted with a solvent such as dichloromethane, tet-rachloroethane, or 1,2-dichlorobenzene) in the presence of dimethyl formamide and/or a phase transfer catalyst. Alternatively, phosphorus trichloride can also be used as chlorination reagent. Cleavage of the S-S bond with sulfuryl chloride (or CI2) affords ortho-chlorosulfenyl alkyl benzoates in good yields. The following scheme illustrates a typical reaction sequence:<br><br>
Said ortho-chlorosulfenyl alkyl benzoates, preferably ortho-chlorosulfenyl methyl benzoate, is the ideal starting material for the synthesis of diaryl sulfides by reaction with a large variety of<br><br>
arene compounds under Friedel-Crafts-like conditions, for example, in the presence of AICI3 in an excess of the arene or in an inert solvent such as dichloromethane, tetrachloroethane, or 1,2-dichloroben2ene at typical temperatures of -20 - 100°C. These sulfides are then oxidized under well known oxidation conditions, by organic peroxides, such as peracetic acid or m-chloroperbenzoic acid, or inorganic peroxides such as hydrogen peroxide in acetic acid:<br><br>
The compounds of the present invention can be prepared by known methods, especially by condensation of diaryl sulfoxides possessing an ester group in the ortho position of one of the aryl groups with a suitable aromatic or heterocyclic compound in a strongly acidic medium, followed my metathesis with a salt of the desired anion. Several strong acids are available as solvents, for example, sulfuric acid, polyphosphoric acid, methanesulfonic acid, or gaseous hydrogen chloride (US3488378). Mixtures of methanesulfonic acid and phosphorus pentoxide (J.Org. Chem 1990, 55, 4222), or acetic anhydride and sulphuric acid, or methanesulfonic anhydride are also known. Typical conditions for these methods are temperatures between -50 and +100°C. Higher temperatures are usually not useful, because of secondary reactions, such as, for example, sulfonation of one aromatic ring. Lewis acids, such as aluminum chloride in terachloroethylene (WO 03/008404) can also be used. Usually, the sulfonium salt obtained by these methods has as counteranion the anion derived from one of the acids, for instance, a hydrogenosulfate, methanesulfonate, or trifluoromethanesul-fonate.<br>
Conditions without metathesis, such as arylation in acetic acid /acetic anhydride / sulfuric acid in the presence of potassium hexafluorophosphate or aqueous 75% HPFe are described for example in US patent application publication 2004/0030158. The following scheme illustrates the final steps of the synthesis.<br><br>
The synthesis is extremely versatile, as it allows the introduction of a large number of aryl groups. Ari and Ar2 can basically be any aryl group, which can be acylated via a Friedel-Crafts type reaction.<br><br>
In addition, the ester group can be hydrolysed to COOH or it can undergo a trans-esterification reaction with an alcohol derivative:<br><br>
The compounds of the formula I, II, III and IV are used as photolatent acids, i.e compounds<br>
that upon irradiation release an acid.<br>
Accordingly, an object of the invention is a radiation-sensitive composition comprising<br>
(a1)  a cationically or acid-catalytically polymerisable or crosslinkable compound or<br>
(a2)  a compound that increases its solubility in a developer under the action of acid; and<br>
(b)    at least one compound of the formula I, II, III or IV as described above.<br>
The compositions according to the invention comprise as component (a1), for example, resins and compounds that can be cationically polymerised by alkyl- or aryl-containing cations or by protons. Examples thereof include cyclic ethers, especially epoxides and oxetanes, and also vinyl ethers and hydroxy-containing compounds. Lactone compounds and cyclic thioethers as well as vinyl thioethers can also be used. Further examples include aminoplas-tics or phenolic resole resins. These are especially melamine, urea, epoxy, phenolic, acrylic, polyester and alkyd resins, but especially mixtures of acrylic, polyester or alkyd resins with a melamine resin. These include also modified surface-coating resins, such as, for example, acrylic-modified polyester and alkyd resins.   Examples of individual types of resins that are<br><br>
included under the terms acrylic, polyester and alkyd resins are described, for example, in Wagner, Sarx/Lackkunstharze (Munich, 1971), pages 86 to 123 and 229 to 238, or in Ull-mann/Encyclopadie der techn. Chemie, 4*^ edition, volume 15 (1978), pages 613 to 628, or Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Verlag Chemie, 1991, Vol. 18, 360 ff.. Vol. A19, 371 ff.. The surface-coating preferably comprises an amino resin. Examples thereof include etherified and non-etherified melamine, urea, guanidine and biuret resins. Of special importance is acid catalysis for the curing of surface-coatings comprising etherified amino resins, such as, for example, methylated or butylated melamine resins (N-methoxymethyl- or N-butoxymethyl-melamine) or methylated/butylated glycolurils.<br>
It is possible, for example, to use all customary epoxides, such as aromatic, aliphatic or cycloaliphatic epoxy resins. These are compounds having at least one, preferably at least two, epoxy group(s) in the molecule.

X     is a number from 1 to 6; and<br>
R50 is a mono- to hexavalent alkyl or aryl radical.<br>
Preference is given, for example, to glycidyl ether compounds of formula XX, wherein<br>

R50 when X = 1, is unsubstituted or Ci-Ci2alkyl-substituted phenyl, naphthyl, anthracyl, bi-<br>
phenylyl, Ci-C2oalkyl, or C2-C2oalkyl interrupted by one or more oxygen atoms, or<br><br><br><br>
Further examples for component (a1) are polyglycidyl ethers and poly(p-methylglycidyl) ethers obtainable by the reaction of a compound containing at least two free alcoholic and/or phenolic hydroxy groups per molecule with the appropriate epichlorohydrin under alkaline conditions, or alternatively in the presence of an acid catalyst with subsequent alkali treatment.

Further suitable cationically polymerisable or crosslinkable components (a1) can be found, for example, also in US 3117099, US 4299938 and US 4339567.<br>
From the group of aliphatic epoxides there are suitable especially the monofunctional symbol oc-olefin epoxides having an unbranched chain consisting of 10,12,14 or 16 carbon atoms.<br>
Because nowadays a large number of different epoxy compounds are commercially available, the properties of the binder can vary widely.  One possible variation, for example de-<br><br>
pending upon the intended use of the composition, is the use of mixtures of different epoxy compounds and the addition of flexibilisers and reactive diluents.<br>
The epoxy resins can be diluted with a solvent to facilitate application, for example when application is effected by spraying, but the epoxy compound is preferably used in the solvent-less state. Resins that are viscous to solid at room temperature can be applied hot.<br>
Also suitable as component (a1) are all customary vinyl ethers, such as aromatic, aliphatic or cycloaliphatic vinyl ethers and also silicon-containing vinyl ethers. These are compounds having at least one, preferably at least two, vinyl ether groups in the molecule.

Further cationically curable formulations can be found, for example, in EP 119425.<br>
As component (a1), preference is given to cycloaliphatic epoxides, or epoxides based on bisphenol A.<br>
Accordingly, the invention relates also to a radiation-sensitive composition wherein component (a1) is at least one compound selected from the group of cycloaliphatic epoxy compounds, glycidyl ethers, oxetane compounds, vinyl ethers, acid-crosslinkable melamine res-<br><br>
ins, acid-crosslinkable hydroxymethylene compounds and acid-crosslinkable alkoxy-methylene compounds.<br>
If desired, the composition according to the invention can also contain free-radically poly-merisable components, such as ethylenically unsaturated monomers, oligomers or polymers. These radically polymerizable components may be added to either component (a1) or component (a2).

Vinyl ether monomers and oligomers, and maleate-terminated oligomers having polyester, poly-urethane, polyether, polyvinyl ether and epoxy main chains can also be used. Also copolymers of vinyl ethers and monomers which are functionalised with maleic acid, as described in WO 90/01512, are also very suitable. Also suitable, however, are copolymers of monomers functionalised with vinyl ether and maleic acid. Such unsaturated oligomers can also be referred to as pre-polymers.

Suitable unsaturated polyesters and polyamides are derived, for example, from maleic acid and diols or diamines. The maleic acid may have been partially replaced by other dicarbox-ylic acids. They can be used together with ethylenically unsaturated comonomers, for example styrene. The polyesters and polyamides can also be derived from dicarboxylic acids and ethylenically unsaturated diols or diamines, especially from those having longer chains of, for example, from 6 to 20 carbon atoms. Examples of polyurethanes are those composed of saturated or unsaturated diisocyanates and saturated or unsaturated diols. Polybutadiene and polyisoprene and copolymers thereof are known. Suitable comonomers include, for example, olefins, such as ethylene, propene, butene, hexene, (meth)acrylates, acrylonitrile, styrene and vinyl chloride. Polymers having (meth)acrylate groups in the side chain are also known. They may be, for example, reaction products of novolak-based epoxy resins with (meth)acrylic acid; homo- or co-polymers of vinyl alcohol or hydroxyalkyi derivatives thereof that have been esterified with (meth)acrylic acid; or homo- and co-polymers of (meth)acrylates that have been esterified with hydroxyalkyi (meth)acrylates.<br>
It is also possible to use compounds that can be crosslinked equally both free-radically and cationically. Such compounds contain, for example, both a vinyl group and a cycloaliphatic epoxy group. Examples thereof are described in JP 2-289611-A and US 6048953.<br>
Mixtures of two or more such free-radically polymerisable materials can also be used.<br><br>
Binders may also be added to the compositions according to the invention, this being especially advantageous when the photopolymerisable compounds are liquid or viscous substances. The amount of binder may be, for example, from 5 to 95 % by weight, preferably from 10 to 90 % by weight and especially from 40 to 90 % by weight, based on total solids. The binder will be selected according to the field of use and the properties required therefor, such as developability in aqueous and organic solvent systems, adhesion to substrates and sensitivity to oxygen.<br>
Suitable binders are, for example, polymers having a molecular weight of approximately from 2000 to 2 000 000, preferably from 5000 to 1 000 000. Examples thereof are: homo- and copolymers of acrylates and methacrylates, for example copolymers of methyl meth-acrylate/ethyl acrylate/methacrylic acid, poly(methacrylic acid alkyl esters), poly(acrylic acid alkyl esters); phenolic resins, cellulose derivatives, such as cellulose esters and ethers, for example cellulose acetate, cellulose acetate butyrate, methyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose; polyvinyl butyral, polyvinylformal, polyolefins, cyclised rubber, polyethers, such as poly-ethylene oxide, polypropylene oxide, polytetrahydrofuran; polystyrene, polycarbonate, poly-urethane, chlorinated polyolefins, polyvinyl chloride, copolymers of vinyl chloride/vinylidene chloride, copolymers of vinylidene chloride with acrylonitrile, methyl methacrylate and vinyl acetate, polyvinyl acetate, copoly(ethylene/vinyl acetate), polymers such as polycaprolactam and poly(hexamethyleneadipamide), polyesters such as poly(ethylene glycol terephthalate) and poly(hexamethylene glycol succinate); and polyamides.<br>
The resins mentioned below under (C1) may also be used as free-radically curable component. Of particular interest are, for example, unsaturated acrylates having reactive functional groups. The reactive functional group may be selected, for example, from a hydroxyl, thiol, isocyanate, epoxy, anhydride, carboxyl, amino or blocked amino group. Examples of OH-group-containing unsaturated acrylates are hydroxyethyl and hydroxybutyl acrylates and also glycidyl acrylates.<br>
The unsaturated compounds may also be used in admixture with non-photopolymerisable film-forming components. These may be, for example, polymers that can be dried physically or solutions thereof in organic solvents, such as nitrocellulose or cellulose acetobutyrate. They may alternatively be chemically or thermally curable resins, such as polyisocyanates,<br><br>
polyepoxides or melamine resins. Drying oils, such as linseed oil, linseed-oil-modified alkyd resins, tung oil and soybean oil, can also be present. The concomitant use of thermally curable resins is important for use in so-called hybrid systems which are photopolymerised in a first step and crosslinked by thermal aftertreatment in a second step.<br>
Thus, the radiation-curable compositions of the present invention may also comprise: (A1) compounds having one or more free-radically polymerisable double bonds that additionally contain at least one further functional group that is reactive in addition and/or condensation reactions (examples are given above),<br>
(A2) compounds having one or more free-radically polymerisable double bonds that additionally contain at least one further functional group that is reactive in addition and/or condensation reactions, the additional functional group being complementary to or reactive towards the additional functional group of component (A1),<br>
(A3) at least one monomeric, oligomeric and/or polymeric compound having at least one functional group that is reactive in addition and/or condensation reactions towards the functional groups of component (A1) or (A2) that are present in addition to the free-radically polymerisable double bonds.<br>
Component (A2) in each case carries the groups complementary to or reactive towards component (A1). Different types of functional groups may also be present in a component. Component (A3) provides a component that contains further functional groups that are reactive in addition and/or condensation reactions and that are able to react with the functional groups of (A1) or (A2) that are present in addition to the free-radically polymerisable double bonds. Component (A3) contains no free-radically polymerisable double bonds. Examples of such combinations (A1), (A2), (A3) can be found in WO 99/55785. Examples of suitable functional groups are hydroxyl, isocyanate, epoxy, anhydride, carboxyl and blocked amino groups. Examples have been described above.<br>
Constituents of the thermally curable component (C) are, for example, thermally curable lacquer or coating system constituents customary in the art. Component (C) accordingly may consist of a large number of constituents.<br>
Examples of component (C) include oligomers and/or polymers derived from a,|3-unsaturated acids and derivatives thereof, for example polyacrylates and polymethacrylates, polymethyl methacrylates impact-resistant-modified with butyl acrylate, polyacrylamides and polyacry-<br><br>
lonitriles. Further examples of component (C) are urethanes, polyurethanes derived on the one hand from polyethers, polyesters and polyacrylates having free hydroxyl groups and on the other hand from aliphatic or aromatic polyisocyanates, and educts thereof. Component (C) accordingly also includes, for example, crosslinkable acrylic resins derived from substituted acrylic acid esters, for example epoxy acrylates, urethane acrylates and polyester acrylates. Alkyd resins, polyester resins and acrylate resins and modifications thereof that are crosslinked with melamine resins, urea resins, isocyanates, isocyanurates, polyisocyanates, polyisocyanurates and epoxy resins, may also be a constituent of component (C). Component (C) is, for example, generally a film-forming binder based on a thermoplastic or thermocurable resin, especially on a thermocurable resin. Examples thereof are alkyd, acrylic, polyester, phenolic, melamine, epoxy and polyurethane resins and mixtures thereof. Examples thereof can be found, for example, in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 5th Ed., Vol. A18, pp. 368-426, VCH, Weinheim 1991.<br>
Component (C) may also be a cold-curable or hot-curable binder, in which case the addition of a curing catalyst may be advantageous. Suitable catalysts that accelerate the full cure of the binder can be found, for example, in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Vol, A18, page 469, VCH Verlagsgesellschaft, Weinheim 1991. Specific examples of binders suitable as component (C) are:<br>
1.	surface-coatings based on cold- or hot-crosslinkable alkyd, acrylate, polyester, epoxy or melamine resins or mixtures of such resins, optionally with the addition of a curing catalyst;<br>
2.	two-component polyurethane surface-coatings based on hydroxyl-group-containing acrylate, polyester or polyether resins and aliphatic or aromatic isocyanates, isocyanurates or polyisocyanates;<br>
3.	one-component polyurethane surface-coatings based on blocked isocyanates, iso<br>
cyanurates or polyisocyanates, which are de-blocked during heating; it is also possible to<br>
add melamine resins as appropriate;<br>
4.	one-component polyurethane surface-coatings based on aliphatic or aromatic urethanes or polyurethanes and hydroxyl-group-containing acrylate, polyester or polyether resins;<br>
5.	one-component polyurethane surface-coatings based on aliphatic or aromatic urethane acrylates or polyurethane acrylates having free amine groups in the urethane structure and melamine resins or polyether resins, optionally with the addition of a curing catalyst;<br>
6.	two-component surface-coatings based on (poly)ketimines and aliphatic or aromatic isocyanates, isocyanurates or polyisocyanates;<br><br>
7.	two-component surface-coatings based on (poly)ketimines and an unsaturated acrylate resin or a polyacetoacetate resin or a methacrylamidoglycolate methyl ester;<br>
8.	two-component surface-coatings based on carboxyl- or amino-group-containing poly-acrylates and polyepoxides;<br>

12.	two-component surface-coatings based on unsaturated polyacrylates and polymalo-nates;<br>
13.	thermoplastic polyacrylate surface-coatings based on thermoplastic acrylate resins or extrinsically crosslinking acrylate resins in combination with etherified melamine resins;<br>
14.	surface-coating systems based on urethane (meth)acrylate having (meth)acryloyl groups and free isocyanate groups and on one or more compounds that react with iso-cyanates, for example free or esterified polyols. Such systems have been published, for example, in EP 928800.<br>
Blocked isocyanates that can also be used as component (C) are described, for example, in Organischer Metallschutz: Entwicklung und Anwendung von Beschichtungsstoffen, pages 159-160, Vincentz Verlag, Hanover (1993). These are compounds in which the highly reactive NCO group is "blocked" by reaction with specific radicals, for example a primary alcohol, phenol, acetic acid ethyl ester, e-caprolactam, phthalimide, imidazole, oxime or amine. The blocked isocyanate is stable in liquid systems and also in the presence of hydroxy groups. Upon heating, the blocking group (protecting group) is removed again and the NCO group is freed.<br>
1-Component (1C) and 2-component (2C) systems may be used as component (C). Examples of such systems are described in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Vol. A18, Paints and Coatings, pages 404-407, VCH Verlagsgesellschaft mbH, Weinheim (1991). It is possible to optimise the composition by specific adaptation, for example by varying the binder/crosslinking agent ratios. Such measures will be known to the person skilled in the art and are customary in coating technology.<br><br>
In the curing process according to the invention, component (C) is preferably a mixture based on acrylate/melamine (and melamine derivatives), 2-component polyurethane, 1-component polyurethane, 2-component epoxy/carboxy or 1-component epoxy/carboxy. Mixtures of such systems are also possible, for example the addition of melamine (or derivatives thereof) to 1-component polyurethanes.<br>
Component (C) is preferably a binder based on a polyacrylate with melamine or on a melamine derivative or a system based on a polyacrylate and/or polyester polyol with an unblocked polyisocyanate or polyisocyanurate.<br>
Component (C) may also comprise monomeric and/or oligomeric compounds having ethylenically unsaturated bonds (prepolymers) that additionally contain at least one or more OH, NH2, COOH, epoxy or NCO group(s) (= C1) that are capable of reaction with the binder and/or the crosslinking agent constituent of component (C). After application and thermal curing, the ethylenically unsaturated bonds are converted to a crosslinked, high molecular weight form by irradiation with UV light. Examples of such components (C) are described, for example, in the above-mentioned publication, Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 5th Ed., Vol. A18, pages 451-453, or by S. Urano, K. Aoki, N. Tsuboniva and R. Mizugu-chi in Progress in Organic Coatings, 20 (1992), 471-486, or by H. Terashima and O. Isozaki in JOCCA1992(6),222.<br>
(CI) may, for example, also be an OH-group-containing unsaturated acrylate, for example hydroxyethyl or hydroxybutyl acrylate or a glycidyl acrylate. Component (01) may be of any desired structure (for example it may contain units of polyester, polyacrylate, polyether, etc.), provided that it contains an ethylenically unsaturated double bond and additionally free OH, COOH, NH2, epoxy or NCO groups.<br>
(CI) may, for example, also be obtained by reacting an epoxy-functional oligomer with acrylic acid or methacrylic acid. A typical example of an OH-functional oligomer having vinylic double bonds is<br><br>
Another possible method of obtaining component (01) is, for example, the reaction of an oligomer that contains only one epoxy group and has a free OH group at another position in the molecule.<br><br>
The quantity ratio of the free-radically radiation-curable-polymerisable components to the thermally polymerisable component (C) in the UV- and thermally-crossllnkable formulations is not critical. "Dual-cure" systems are known to the person skilled in the art, who will therefore be familiar with the optimum mixing ratios of the free-radically- and thermally-crossllnkable components according to the intended use. For example, the ratio can be in the range from 5:95 to 95:5, from 20:80 to 80:20 or from 30:70 to 70:30, for example from 40:60 to 60:40.<br>
Examples of "dual-cure" systems, that is to say systems comprising both radiation-curable and thermally curable components, can be found inter alia in US 5922473, columns 6 to 10.<br>
The formulations according to the invention can further comprise as component (a1) nonaqueous coating compositions based on an oxidatively drying alkyd resin which contains at least one, preferably two or more, functional group(s) capable of undergoing polymerisation or polycondensation reactions in the presence of an acid. Examples of such resins are vinyl-ether-functionalised alkyd resins, acetal-functionalised alkyd resins, and/or alkoxysilane-functionalised alkyd resins, as proposed, e.g., in WO 99/47617. Those modified alkyd resins may be used alone or in combination with other alkyd resins. At least some of the alkyd resin composition in the non-aqueous coating is oxidatively drying as a result of the incorporation of a large number of unsaturated, aliphatic compounds, at least some of which are polyunsaturated.<br>
Formulations containing those modified alkyd resins as component (a1) may optionally contain, in addition to the photoinitiator (b), an oxidative dryer. Suitable oxidative dryers are, for example, metal siccatives. There may be mentioned as suitable siccatives, for example, the metal salts of (cyclo)aliphatic acids, such as octanoic acid and naphthenic acid, the metals to be used being, for example, cobalt, manganese, lead, zirconium, calcium, zinc and rare earth metals. Mixtures of siccatives may be used. Preference is given to metal salts of cobalt, zirconium and calcium, or mixtures thereof. The siccatives (calculated as metal) are usually used in an amount of from 0.001 to 3 % by weight.<br>
Under certain conditions it may also be advantageous, when using the modified alkyd resins as component (a1), to use one or more mono- or bis-acylphosphine oxide photoinitiators in addition to the sulfonium salt of formula (I). Suitable monoacyl- or bisacyl-phosphine oxide photoinitiators include, for example, monoacylphosphine oxides such as (2,4,6-trimethylbenzoyl)-diphenylphosphine oxide (DAROCUR® TPO) or (2,4,6-trimethylbenzoyl-<br><br>
phenyl-ethoxy-phosphine oxide, or bisacylphosphine oxide photoinitiators such as bis(2,6-di-methoxybenzoyl)-2,4,4-trimethylpentyl-phosphine oxide, bis(2,4,6-trimethylbenzoyl)-(2,4-dipentyloxyphenyl)-phosphine oxide and bis(2,4,6-trimethylbenzoyl)phenyl-phosphine oxide (IRGACURE®819). Those monoacyl- or bisacyl-phosphine oxides are advantageously used in an amount of from 0.5 to 5 %.<br>
When component (a1) contains modified alkyd resins, in addition to the photoinitiator (b) it is also possible to use an oxidative dryer and suitable monoacyl- or bisacyl-phosphine oxide photoinitiators.<br>
The alkyd resins used as component (a1) contain a large number of unsaturated, aliphatic compounds, at least some of which are polyunsaturated. The unsaturated aliphatic compounds preferably used for the preparation of those alkyd resins are unsaturated aliphatic monocarboxylic acids, especially polyunsaturated aliphatic monocarboxylic acids. Examples of mono-unsaturated fatty acids are myristoleic acid, palmitic acid, oleic acid, gadoleic acid, erucic acid and ricinoleic acid. Preferably fatty acids containing conjugated double bonds, such as dehydrogenated castor oil fatty acid and/or tung oil fatty acid, are used. Other suitable monocarboxylic acids include tetrahydrobenzoic acid and hydrogenated or non-hydrogenated abietic acid or the isomers thereof. If desired, the monocarboxylic acid in question may be used wholly or in part in the form of a triglyceride, e.g. as vegetable oil, in the preparation of the alkyd resin. If desired, mixtures of two or more such mono-carboxylic acids or triglycerides may be used, optionally in the presence of one or more saturated, (cyclo)aliphatic or aromatic monocarboxylic acids, e.g. pivalic acid, 2-ethyl-hexanoic acid, lauric acid, palmitic acid, stearic acid, 4-tert-butyl-benzoic acid, cyclo-pentanecarboxylic acid, naphthenic acid, cyclohexanecarboxylic acid, 2,4-dimethylbenzoic acid, 2-methylbenzoic acid and benzoic acid.<br>
If desired, polycarboxylic acids may also be incorporated into the alkyd resin, such as phthalic acid, isophthalic acid, terephthalic acid, 5-tert-butylisophthalic acid, trimellitic acid, pyromellitic acid, succinic acid, adipic acid, 2,2,4-trimethyladipic acid, azelaic acid, sebacic acid, dimerised fatty acids, cyclopentane-1,2-dicarboxylic acid, cyclohexane-1,2-dicarboxylic acid, 4-methylcyclohexane-1,2-dicarboxylic acid, tetrahydrophthalic acid, endomethylene-cyclohexane-1,2-dicarboxylic acid, butane-1,2,3,4-tetracarboxylic acid, endoisopropylidene-cyclohexane-1,2-dicarboxylic acid, cyclohexane-1,2,4,5-tetracarboxylic acid and butane-1,2,3,4-tetracarboxylic acid. If desired, the carboxylic acid in question may be used as an an-<br><br>
hydride or in the form of an ester, for example an ester of an alcohol having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms.<br>
In addition, the alkyd resin can be composed of di- or poly-valent hydroxyl compounds. Examples of suitable divalent hydroxyl compounds are ethylene glycol, 1,3-propanediol, 1,6-hexanediol, 1,12-dodecanediol, 3-methyl-1,5-pentanediol, 2,2,4-trimethyl-1,6-hexane-diol, 2,2-dimethyl-1,3-propanediol and 2-methyl-2-cyclohexyl-1,3-propanediol. Examples of suitable triols are glycerol, trimethylolethane and trimethylolpropane. Suitable polyols having more than 3 hydroxyl groups are pentaerythritol, sorbitol and etherified products of the compounds in question, such as ditrimethylolpropane and di-, tri- and tetra-pentaerythritol. Preferably, compounds having from 3 to 12 carbon atoms, e.g. glycerol, pentaerythritol and/or dipentaerythritol, are used.<br>
The alkyd resins can be obtained by direct esterification of the constituents, with the option that some of those components may already have been converted into ester diols or polyester diols. The unsaturated fatty acids can also be used in the form of a drying oil, such as linseed oil, tuna fish oil, dehydrogenated castor oil, coconut oil and dehydrogenated coconut oil. The final alkyd resin is then obtained by transesterification with the other acids and diols added. The transesterification is advantageously carried out at a temperature in the range of from 115 to 250-C, optionally in the presence of solvents such as toluene and/or xylene. The reaction is advantageously carried out in the presence of a catalytic amount of a transesterification catalyst. Examples of suitable transesterification catalysts include acids, such as p-toluenesulfonic acid, basic compounds, such as an amine, or compounds such as calcium oxide, zinc oxide, tetraisopropyl orthotitanate, dibutyltin oxide and tri-phenylbenzylphosphoni-um chloride.<br>
The vinyl ether, acetal and/or alkoxysilane compounds used as part of component (a1) preferably contain at least two vinyl ether, acetal and/or alkoxysilane groups and have a molecular weight of 150 or more. Those vinyl ether, acetal and/or alkoxysilane compounds can be obtained, for example, by the reaction of a commercially available vinyl ether, acetal and/or alkoxysilane compound containing a vinyl ether, acetal and/or alkoxysilane group and in addition a maximum of one functional amino, epoxy, thiol, isocyanate, acrylic, hydride or hydroxyl group, with a compound having at least two groups capable of reacting with an amino, epoxy, thiol, isocyanate, acrylic, hydride or hydroxyl group. As examples thereof there may be mentioned compounds having at least two epoxy, isocyanate, hydroxyl and/or ester groups or compounds having at least two ethylenically or ethynylenically unsaturated groups.<br><br>
As component (a1), preference is given to a composition in which the vinyl ether, acetal and/or alkoxysilane compounds are covalently bonded to the alkyd resin by addition via a reactive group such as an amino, hydroxyl, thiol, hydride, epoxy and/or isocyanate group. For that purpose, the compounds must have at least one group capable of forming an adduct with the reactive groups present in the alkyd resin.<br>
To incorporate vinyl ether groups into the alkyd resin, use is made of a vinyloxyalkyi compound, the alkyl group of which is substituted by a reactive group, such as a hydroxyl, amino, epoxy or isocyanate group, that is capable of forming an adduct with one or more of the reactive groups present in the alkyd resin.<br>
As component (a1), preference is given to compositions in which the ratio of the number of oxidatively drying groups present in the alkyd resin to the number of groups that are reactive in the presence of an acid is in the range of from 1/10 to 15/1, especially from 1/3 to 5/1. Instead of a single modified alkyd resin, it is also possible to use a plurality of alkyd resins, with one alkyd resin being highly modified and the others being less modified or not modified at all.<br>
Examples of vinyl ether compounds capable of being covalently bonded to the alkyd resin are ethylene glycol monovinyl ether, butanediol monovinyl ether, hexanediol monovinyl ether, triethylene glycol monovinyl ether, cyclohexanedimethanol monovinyl ether, 2-ethyl-hexa-nediol monovinyl ether, polytetrahydrofuran monovinyl ether, tetraethylene glycol monovinyl ether, trimethylolpropane divinyl ether and aminopropyl vinyl ether.<br>
Adducts can be formed, for example, by reacting the vinyl ether compounds containing a hydroxyl group or amino group with an excess of a diisocyanate, followed by the reaction of that free-isocyanate-group-containing adduct with the free hydroxyl groups of the alkyd resin. Preferably, a process is used in which first the free hydroxyl groups of the alkyd resin react with an excess of a polyisocyanate, and then the free isocyanate groups react with an amino-group- or hydroxyl-group-containing vinyl ether compound. Instead of a diisocyanate, it is also possible to use a diester. Transesterification of the hydroxyl groups present in the alkyd resin with an excess of the diester, followed by transesterification or transamidation of the remaining ester groups with hydroxy-functional vinyl ether compounds or amino-functional vinyl ether compounds, respectively, yields vinyl-ether-functional alkyd resins. It is also possible to incorporate (meth)acrylate groups into the alkyd resin during preparation of the alkyd resin, by carrying out the preparation in the presence of a hydroxy-functional (meth)acrylate<br><br>
ester, such as hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA), and then reacting the thus functionalised alkyd resin by means of a Michael reaction with a vinyl-ether-group-containing compound and a primary-amino-group-containing compound, followed by reaction with e.g. an isocy-anate compound, in order to obtain a non-basic nitrogen atom.<br>
An example of such a reaction is described, for example, in WO 99/47617. Esterification of ricinine fatty acid with dipentaerythritol, followed by transesterification of the free hydroxyl groups with diethyl malonate and 4-hydroxybutyl vinyl ether in a suitable ratio, yields a vinyl-ether-functional alkyd resin suitable for use as component (a1).<br>
For the preparation of acetal-functional alkyd resins, use is generally made of dialkyi acetal functionalised with an amino group. Examples of suitable acetal compounds include 4-amin-obutyraldehyde dimethyl acetal and 4-aminobutyraldehyde diethyl acetal. The alkyd resin is modified by the addition of the aminoacetal monomer to an alkyd resin functionalised with isocyanate groups, with ester groups of a low-boiling alcohol or with (meth)acrylate groups. The resulting dialkyl-acetal-modified alkyd resin can be incorporated into the coating composition having a high solids content and low viscosity. The preparation of acetal-functional alkyd resins can also be carried out by reacting hydroxyacetal with the carboxyl groups of the alkyd resin or by reacting a diisocyanate or diester compound with the hydroxyl groups of the alkyd resin.<br>
An example of this preparative method is described in WO 99/47617, for example the esterification of a hydroxy-functional alkyd resin with diethyl malonate, followed by transamidation of the free ester group with 4-aminobutyraldehyde dimethyl acetal in a suitable ratio. The resulting acetal-modified alkyd resin is suitable as component (a1).<br>
For the incorporation of alkoxysilane groups into the alkyd resin, use is made of a siloxane compound having one or more reactive group(s) which are subsequently reacted with one or more of the constituents making up the alkyd resin. These are, for example, alkoxy-silanes of<br>
the formula:	(E)a-Si(Rio)b(R2o)c, wherein<br>
Rio is alkoxy or oxyalkylenealkoxy or, when E is hydrogen, Rio is halogen, R20 is an aliphatic, cycloaliphatic or aromatic group, and E is hydrogen or an alky! group substituted by an amino, isocyanate, mercapto or epoxy group; a is from 1 to 3, b is from 1 to 3, c is from 0 to 2, and a + b + c = 4.<br>
Rio is preferably an alkoxy group having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms in the alkoxy group, and R20 is preferably a group having not more than 18 carbon atoms.<br><br>
Examples of suitable siloxane compounds are 3-aminopropyl-triethoxysilane, polyglycol-ether-modified aminosilane, 3-aminopropyl-trimethoxysilane, 3-aminopropyltris-methoxy-ethoxyethoxysilane, 3-aminopropyl-methyl-diethoxysilane, N-2-aminoethyl-3-aminopropyl-tri-methoxy-silane, N-2-aminoethyl-3-aminopropyl-methyldimethoxy-silane, N-methyl-3-amino-propyl-trimethoxysilane, 3-ureidopropyl-triethoxysilane, 3,4,5-dihydroimidazol-1-yl-propyltri-ethoxysilane, 3-methacryloxypropyl-trimethoxysilane, 3-glycidyloxypropyl-trimethoxysilane, 3-mercaptopropyl-trimethoxysilane and 3-mercaptopropyl-methyl-dimethoxysilane, triethoxysil-ane, diethoxymethylsilane, dimethoxymethylsilane, tri-methoxysilane, trichlorosilane, thiodo-silane, tribromosilane, dichloromethylsilane and dibromomethylsilane. The alkyd resin can be modified, for example, by the insertion of an amino-group-modified alkoxysilane into an alkyd resin modified with a polyisocyanate or a polyester of a low-boiling alcohol. Hydride-functional alkoxysilanes can be bonded directly to the alkyd, i.e. without modification with a binding molecule such as a diisocyanate or diester, by adding a compound containing a silylhydride group to an ethylenically unsaturated group in the alkyd resin. That addition is catalysed by a transition metal. In that process, use is preferably made of a halogenated silylhydride and, in order to terminate the addition reaction, conversion into an alkoxysilane compound with a low-boiling alcohol. The addition reaction is advantageously carried out in the absence of sterically hindering groups and proceeds in optimum manner when the ethylenically unsaturated groups are terminal groups, as is the case, for example, with esters of 10-undecenecarboxylic acid.<br>
Examples of the preparation of alkoxysiloxane-modified alkyd resins are described in WO 99/47617. Estehfication of a hydroxy-functional alkyd resin with diethyl malonate, followed by transamidation of the free ester group with 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane in a suitable ratio yields an alkoxysilane-modified alkyd resin. Hydroxy-modified alkyd resin can also be reacted with an excess of isophorone diisocyanate, followed by reaction of the free isocy-anate groups with 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane. Both alkoxysiloxane-modified alkyd resins obtained by the processes described are suitable for use in component (a1).<br>

The DAROCUR and IRGACURE compounds are available from Ciba Specialty Chemicals.<br>
Other additional components can be, for example, hydroxy-functional components, such as alcohols, polyester polyols, polyether polyols, hydroxy-group-containing polyurethanes, castor oil, etc.. Examples thereof include aliphatic and cycloaliphatic polyols, such as alkylene diols having preferably from 2 to 12 carbon atoms, e.g. ethylene glycol, 1,2- or 1,3-propane-diol, 1,2-, 1,3- or 1,4-butanediol, pentanediol, hexanediol, octanediol, dodecanediol, diethyl-ene glycol, triethylene glycol, polyethylene glycols having molecular weights of preferably from 200 to 1500, 1,3-cyclopentanediol, 1,2-, 1,3- or 1,4-cyclohexanediol, 1,4-di-hydroxy-methylcyclohexane, glycerol, trJs(|3-hydroxy-ethyl)amine, trimethylolethane, tri-methylolpropa-ne, pentaerythritol, dipentaerythritol and sorbitol. The polyols can be partially or fully esteri-fied by one or by different unsaturated carboxylic acids, it being possible for the free hydroxyl<br><br>
groups in partial esters to have been modified, e.g. etherified, or esterified by other carbox-ylic acids. Examples of esters include: trimethylolpropane triacrylate, trimethylolethane triacrylate, trimethylolpropane trimethacrylate, trimethylolethane trimeth-acrylate, tetramethylene glycol dimethacrylate, triethylene glycol dimethacrylate, tetraethylene glycol diacrylate, pentaerythritol diacrylate, pentaerythritol triacrylate, pentaerythritol tetraacrylate, dipentaerythritol diacrylate, dipentaerythritol triacrylate, dipentaerythritol tetraacrylate, dipentaerythritol pentaacrylate, dipentaerythritol hexaacrylate, tripentaerythritol octaacrylate, pentaerythritol dimethacrylate, pentaerythritol trimethacrylate, dipenta-erythritol dimethacrylate, dipentaerythritol tetramethacrylate, tripentaerythritol octamethacrylate, pentaerythritol diitaconate, dipentaerythritol trisitaconate, dipentaerythritol pentaitaconate, dipentaerythritol hexaitaconate, ethylene glycol diacrylate, 1,3-butanediol diacrylate, 1,3-butanediol dimethacrylate, 1,4-butanediol diitaconate, sorbitol triacrylate, sorbitol tetraacrylate, pentaerythritol-modified triacrylate, sorbitol tetramethacrylate, sorbitol pentaacrylate, sorbitol hexaacrylate, oligoester acrylates and methacrylates, glycerol di- and tri-acrylate, 1,4-cyclohexane diacrylate, bis-acrylates and bismethacrylates of polyethylene glycol having a molecular weight of from 200 to 1500, or mixtures thereof.<br>
The sulfonium salt compounds of formula I, II, III and IV can also be used, for example, as photo-activatable hardeners for siloxane-group-containing resins. Those resins can, for example, either undergo self-condensation by way of acid-catalysed hydrolysis or can be crosslinked with a second resin component, such as, for example, a polyfunctional alcohol, a hydroxygroup-containing acrylic or polyester resin, a partially hydrolysed polyvinylacetal or a poly-vinyl alcohol. That type of polycondensation of polysiloxanes is described, for example, in J.J. Lebrun, H. Pode, Comprehensive Polymer Science Vol. 5, page 593, Pergamon Press, Oxford, 1989.<br>

Further examples of polymers having alkoxyalkyl ester acid-labile groups can be found in US 5225316 and EP 829766. Examples of polymers having acetal protecting groups are described, for example, in US 5 670 299, EP 780 732, US 5 627 006, US 5558976, US 5558971, US 5468589, EP 704762, EP 762206, EP 342498, EP 553737 and in ACS Symp. Ser. 614, Microelectronics Technology, pp. 35-55 (1995), J. Photopolymer Sci. Technol. Vol. 10, No. 4 (1997), pp. 571-578, J. Photopolymer Sci. Techno!. Vol. 12, no. 4 (1999) pp. 591-599 and in "Proceedings of SPIE", Advances in Resist Technology and Processing XVII, Vol. 3999, Part One, pp. 579-590, 28. Feb.-1, March 2000. The polymers suitable in the composition according to the invention are not, however, limited thereto. The monomers having an acid-labile group can, where appropriate, also be co-polymerised with other free-radically polymerisable monomers that do not carry acid-labile groups, such as, for example, styrene, acrylonitrile, methyl (meth)acrylate, (meth)acrylic acid, 4-hydroxy-styrene, 4-acetoxystyrene, 4-methoxystyrene, 4-vinylcyclohexanol, norbornene, ethyl-norbornene and maleic acid anhydride, in order to establish specific solubility properties and adhesive properties. Alternatively, the acid-labile groups can be introduced only subsequently in a polymer-analogous reaction. It is also known to the person skilled in the art that the prepolymer can be modified in targeted manner before such a polymer-analogous reaction, for example by partial hydrogenation, partial alkylation, partial acetylation. That is to say, that the polymer having acid-labile groups does not, in every case, have to be synthesised from monomers by copolymerisation.<br>
It is also possible to introduce acid-labile crosslinking, as described, for example, in H.-T. Schacht, P. Falcigno, N. Muenzel, R. Schuiz and A. Medina, ACS Symp. Ser. 706 (Micro-and Nanopatterning Polymers), pp. 78-94, 1997; H.-T. Schacht, N. Muenzel, P. Falcigno, H. Holzwarth and J. Schneider, J. Photopolymer Science and Technology, Vol.9, (1996), 573-586.  Such acid-crosslinked systems are preferred in resist applications from the standpoint<br><br>
of heat stability. Such acid-labile crosslinking can also be obtained by the reaction of phenol-group-containing polymers, such as, for example, 4-hydroxystyrene co-polymers, with di- and poly-functional vinyl ethers.<br>
Other examples of component (a2) that increase their solubility in an alkaline developer upon reaction with acid are monomeric compounds, such as, for example, carboxylic acids and phenol-group-containing compounds, in which the carboxylic acid group or phenolic OH group, respectively, has been blocked by acid-labile protecting groups. Such acid-labile blocking can be effected, for example, by conversion of the carboxyl group into a tert-butyl ester group, a 2-methyl-2-adamantyl ester group, an 8-ethyl-8-tricyclodecanyl ester group, a tetrahydropyranyl ester group or some other acid-cleavable ester group. Phenolic OH groups can be blocked according to known processes by conversion, e.g. into acid-cleavable tert-butylcarbonate groups, silyl ethers, acetal groups and ketal groups.<br>
The invention relates also to a radiation-sensitive composition wherein component (a2) is at least one compound selected from the group of cycloaliphatic copolymers, 4-hydroxy-phenyl-group-containing copolymers, maleic acid anhydride-containing copolymers and acrylic acid-, acrylic acid ester- and methacrylic acid ester-containing copolymers, with the proviso that those copolymers carry functional groups that increase the solubility of the polymer in an alkaline developer after reaction with an acid.<br>
In the compositions according to the invention, the photoinitiator (b) is advantageously used in an amount of from 0.05 % to 15 %, e.g. from 0.5 % to 10 %, preferably from 0.1 % to 5 %, based on the composition.<br>
The compositions according to the invention can be used in numerous applications, for example in cationically radiation-curable printing inks, in cationically radiation-curable coating compounds which may or may not be pigmented, in cationically radiation-curable adhesives, coatings and mouldings, including glass fibre-reinforced and carbon fibre-reinforced composites and inner and outer layers of printed circuit boards.<br>
The compositions according to the invention include also adhesives, as used, for example, for adhesive bonding (DVD bonding) in the manufacture of digital versatile disks (DVD) and as described, for example, in: WO 99/66506, WO 99/63017, JP 11241055 A2 Heisei, JP<br><br>
11181391 A2 Heisei, WO 98/31765, and also as radiation-curable laminating adhesives for flexible packaging (see, e.g., US 5328940), optical adhesives (e.g. German Patent Application DD 225985) and pressure-sensitive adhesives (e.g. US 4988741 and EP 115870).<br>
The compositions according to the invention are advantageously used where there is a need for hard coatings, adhesive bonds or photopolymerised dimensionally stable three-dimensional mouldings (e.g. for rapid prototyping) having good adhesion to paper, glass, metal, silicon, polycarbonate, acrylate polymers and other polymer substrates, and that exhibit only slight shrinkage during curing.<br>
Preference is also given to a composition as described above that comprises in addition to components (a1) or (a2) and (b), additional additives (c) and/or sensitiser compounds (d) and optionally further photoinitiators (e).<br>
The photopolymerisable mixtures can comprise various additives (c) in addition to the photoinitiator. Examples thereof include thermal inhibitors, light stabilisers, optical bright-eners, fillers and pigments, as well as white and coloured pigments, dyes, antistatics, adhesion promoters, wetting agents, flow auxiliaries, lubricants, waxes, anti-adhesive agents, dis-persants, emulsifiers, anti-oxidants, fillers, e.g. talcum, gypsum, silicic acid, rutile, carbon black, zinc oxide, iron oxides, reaction accelerators, thickeners, matting agents, antifoams, and other adjuvants customary, for example, in lacquer and coating technology.<br>
The formulations can also comprise dyes and/or white or coloured pigments as additional additives (c). Depending upon the intended use, it is possible to use both inorganic and organic pigments. Such additives are known to the person skilled in the art; some examples thereof are titanium dioxide pigments, for example of the rutile or anatase type, carbon black, zinc oxide, such as zinc white, iron oxides, such as iron oxide yellow, iron oxide red, chromium yellow, chromium green, nickel titanium yellow, ultramarine blue, cobalt blue, bismuth vanadate, cadmium yellow and cadmium red. Examples of organic pigments are mono- or bis-azo pigments, and metal complexes thereof, phthalocyanine pigments, polycyclic pigments, such as, for example, perylene, anthraquinone, thioindigo, quinacridone and tri-phenylmethane pigments, and diketo-pyrrolo-pyrrole, isoindolinone, e.g. tetrachloro-isoindol-inone, isoindoline, dioxazine, benzimidazolone and quinophthalone pigments.<br><br>
The pigments can be used individually or in admixture in the formulations. Depending upon the intended use, the pigments are added to the formulations in amounts customary in the art, for example in an amount of from 1 to 60 % by weight, or from 10 to 30 % by weight, based on the total weight.<br>
The formulations may, for example, also comprise organic dyes of a wide variety of classes. Examples thereof include azo dyes, methine dyes, anthraquinone dyes and metal complex dyes. Customary concentrations are, for example, from 0.1 to 20%, especially from 1 to 5 %, based on the total weight.<br>
The pigments, latent pigments or dyes or differently coloured precursors of such pigments and dyes that are added may be so selected that they undergo a colour change in the presence of the acid formed from the iodonium salt as a result of irradiation. Such compositions then show, by the colour change, that they have been irradiated and can be used, for example, as irradiation dose indicators, e.g. for UV radiation, electron beams, X-rays, etc..<br>
The choice of additives will depend upon the field of use in question and upon the properties desired for that field. The additives (c) described above are customary in the art and are accordingly used in amounts customary in the art.<br>
The compositions according to the present invention as component (c) also may comprise a stabilizer for the compounds of the formula I, II, III and IV, e.g. from the hindered nitroxyl or phosphite type as are for example described as stabilizers for iodonium salts in WO 05/070989.<br>
Examples for said stabilizer compounds are organic phosphorus stabilizers as disclosed for example in US 6444733, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference. Organic phosphorus stabilizers are known and many are commercially available. Other examples for said stabilizer compounds are hindered nitroxyl stabilizers, or hindered nitroxides, as are well known in the art and are disclosed for example in US 6337426 and, US 5254760, the relevant disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
Other suitable stabilizers (c) for the sulfonium salts of the formula I, II, III and IV are for example disclosed in WO 99/35188. Examples are tertiary and sterically hindered amines, such as the Tinuvin® products, provided by Ciba Specialty Chemicals, in particular Tinuvin® 144 andTinuvin®292.<br><br>
Acceleration of the photopolymerisation can also be effected by adding as further additives (d) photosensitisers that shift or broaden the spectral sensitivity. These are especially aromatic carbonyl compounds, such as, for example, benzophenone, thioxanthone, and especially also isopropylthioxanthone, phenothiazine derivatives, anthraquinone and 3-acyl-coumarin derivatives, terphenyls, styryl ketones, and 3-(aroylmethylene)-thiazolines, cam-phorquinone, and also eosin, rhodamine and erythrosin dyes, and anthracene derivatives, such as, for example, 9-methylanthracene, 9,10-dimethylanthracene, 9,10-diethoxyanthrace-ne, 9,10-dibutyloxyanthracene, 9-methoxyanthracene, 9-anthracenemethanol, especially 9,10-dimethoxy-2-ethyl-anthracene, 9,10-dibutyloxyanthracene and 9,10-diethoxyan-thracene. Further suitable photosensitisers are mentioned, for example, in WO 9847046. Subject of the invention also are radiation-sensitive compositions as described above, additionally to components (a1) or (a2) and (b) comprising at least one sensitizer compound (d), in particular benzophenone, thioxanthone, anthracene or derivatives thereof.<br>
It is also possible to use electron donor compounds, such as, for example, alkyl- and aryl-amine donor compounds, in the composition. Such compounds are, for example, 4-di-meth-ylaminobenzoic acid, ethyl 4-dimethylaminobenzoate, 3-dimethylaminobenzoic acid, 4-dime-thylaminobenzoin, 4-dimethylaminobenzaldehyde, 4-dimethylaminobenzonitrile and 1,2,4-tri-methoxybenzene. Such donor compounds are preferably used in a concentration of from 0.01 to 5 %, especially in a concentration of from 0.05 to 0.50 %, based on the formulation.<br>

X-rays and electron beams, and in the manufacture of three-dimensional articles, e.g. for stereolithography and for composites, e.g. for composites reinforced with glass or carbon or graphite fibres. The compositions are also suitable for the manufacture of optical lenses, e.g. contact lenses or Fresnel lenses, and also in the manufacture of medical apparatus, aids or implants.<br>
The photocurable compositions according to the invention are suitable, for example, as coating materials for all kinds of substrates, for example wood, textiles, paper, ceramics, glass, marble, plastics, such as polyester, polyethylene terephthalate, polyolefins or cellulose acetate, especially in the form of films, and metals, such as Al, Cu, Ni, Fe, Zn, Mg or Co and GaAs, Si or Si02, to which a coating is to be applied or an image is to be applied by image-wise exposure, or to which a structured resist layer is to be applied.<br><br>
The coating of the substrates can be effected by applying a liquid composition, a solution or suspension to the substrate. The choice of solvent and the concentration are governed chiefly by the nature of the composition and by the coating method. The solvent should be inert, that is to say it should not enter into any chemical reaction with the components and it should be capable of being removed again upon drying after the coating operation. Examples of suitable solvents are ketones, ethers and esters, such as methyl ethyl ketone, isobutyl methyl ketone, cyclopentanone, cyclohexanone, 2-heptanone, methyl amyl ketone, N-methylpyrrolidone, gamma-butyrolactone, dioxane, tetrahydrofuran, 2-methoxyethanol, 2-ethoxyethanol, 1-methoxy-2-propanol, 1,2-dimethoxyethane, acetic acid ethyl ester, acetic acid n-butyl ester, propylene glycol monomethyl ether acetate, lactic acid ethyl ester, propylene carbonate and 3-ethoxy-propionic acid ethyl ester. After coating of the substrates, the solvent is generally removed by drying.<br>
The formulation is applied uniformly to a substrate by known coating methods, for example by spin-coating, immersion, knife coating, curtain pouring, brush application or spraying, especially by electrostatic spraying and reverse-roll coating, and by electrophoretic deposition. It is also possible to apply the photosensitive layer to a temporary flexible support and then coat the final substrate, e.g. a copper-laminated printed circuit board, by transferring the layer by lamination.<br>
The amount applied (layer thickness) and the type of substrate (layer support) are dependent upon the desired field of use. The layer thickness range generally includes values from about 0.1 |im to more than 100 |im, preferably from 0.5 micrometre to 50 micrometres. In the manufacture of three-dimensional articles, e.g. by stereolithography, the dimensions of the articles that can be obtained are limited only by the size of the exposure apparatus.<br>
The radiation-sensitive compositions according to the invention are used, for example, as negative resists that have very high photosensitivity and that can be developed in an aqueous-alkaline medium without swelling. They are suitable as photoresists for electronics, such as galvanoresists, etch resists, and in liquid and dry films, solder resists, as resists in the production of colour filters for any type of screen, or to form structures in the manufacture of plasma displays and electroluminescent displays, in the manufacture of printing plates, e.g. offset printing plates, in the manufacture of printing moulds for letterpress printing, flatbed printing, intaglio printing, flexo printing or screen-printing moulds, the production of relief cop-<br><br>
ies, e.g. for the production of texts in braille, for the production of stamps, for use in the etching of mouldings or for use as a microresist in the manufacture of integrated switching circuits. The compositions can also be used as photostructurable dielectrics, for encapsulating materials or as an insulating coating in the manufacture of computer chips, printed circuits and other electhcal or electronic components. The possible layer supports and processing conditions for the coated substrates vary accordingly.<br>
The compounds according to the invention are also used in the manufacture of single- or multi-layer materials for image recording or image reproduction (copies, reprography), which may be monochromatic or polychromatic. Included therein are materials for holographic storage of information, e.g. for holographic images or 3-dimensional holographic data storage. Such materials can also be used in colour test systems. In that technology it is also possible to use formulations that comprise microcapsules and, to produce the image, a thermal step can be carried out after the exposure step. Such systems and technologies and their use are described, e.g., in US Patent Specification 5376459.<br>
For photographic recordings of information there are used, for example, films of polyester, cellulose acetate or plastics-coated papers; for offset printing moulds there is used specially treated aluminium; for the production of printed circuits there are used copper-coated laminates; and for the production of integrated switching circuits there are used silicon wafers. The layer thicknesses for photographic materials and offset printing moulds are generally from about 0.5 |im to 10 |im, and for printed circuits from 1.0 jim to about 100 |im.<br>
The invention relates also to the use of compounds of formula I, II, Mi and IV as radiation-sensitive acid donors in the manufacture of surface-coating compositions, printing inks, printing plates, dental compounds, stereolithography resins, adhesives, anti-adhesive coatings, colour filters, resist materials or image-recording materials.<br>
The invention relates also to a coated substrate that is coated on at least one surface with a composition according to the invention, and to a method for the production of relief images wherein a composition according to the invention is applied to a substrate and is then exposed image-wise.<br><br>
►<br><br>
The expression "image-wise exposure" includes irradiation through a mask that contains a predetermined pattern, for example a diapositive, a metal mask, a chrome mask on a transparent support, exposure by means of a laser beam that is moved, for example controlled by a computer, over the surface of the coated substrate and in that manner produces an image, and irradiation with computer-controlled electron beams (CTP). Images can also be produced by interference between two beams or images, for example for holographic uses. It is also possible to use liquid crystal masks that can be actuated pixel by pixel to produce digital images, as described, for example, by A. Bertsch, J.Y. Jezequel, J.C. Andre in Journal of Photochemistry and Photobiology A: Chemistry 1997, 107, pp. 275-281 and by K.-P. Nicolay in Offset Printing 1997, 6, pp. 34-37.<br>
As already mentioned, the compounds of formula I; II, III and IV can be used especially also as acid donors in photoresists. Resist systems can be obtained by image-wise exposure of formulations comprising compounds of formula I, II, III and IV and a subsequent development step. The term "photoresist" is not limited to the chemically enhanced resists described in greater detail below, but includes all resist materials in which reactions are initiated by the radiation-chemical production of acid and that, in a development step, result in a difference in solubility between exposed and non-exposed regions. For example, also included are resists that can be processed in an aqueous medium, as described, for example, in US Patent Specification 5998092 and in SPIE, Vol. 3999, pp. 569-578 (2000) as well as resists based on a Pinacol rearrangement, as described, for example, in SPIE, Vol. 3999, pp. 62-73 (2000).<br>
Accordingly, the invention relates also to a photoresist that comprises a compound of formula I, II, III or IV as radiation-sensitive acid donor.<br>
A chemically enhanced photoresist is to be understood as being a resist formulation in which the radiation-sensitive component provides a catalytic amount of acid, which in turn catalyses a chemical reaction of at least one acid-sensitive component of the resist. This results in a difference in the solubility of the irradiated and non-irradiated portions of the resist. As a result of the catalytic nature of that process, an acid molecule can initiate reactions at many sites because it diffuses through the reactive polymer matrix from one reaction site to the next, provided it is not captured or destroyed by secondary reactions. Even a low acid concentration is therefore sufficient to obtain large differences in solubility between irradiated<br><br>
and non-irradiated portions of the resist. It is therefore generally sufficient to add only a small amount of latent acid compound. It is necessary, however, for the latent acid donors to be chemically and thermally stable until they are being irradiated. It is also necessary for the latent catalysts to be readily soluble in the liquid resist formulation and in the solid resist film in order to avoid the formation of particles which would adversely affect the use of the resists in microelectronic processing processes.<br>
It will be clear from the above remarks that chemical and thermal stability of the latent acid donor is essential for its use in chemically enhanced photoresists.<br>
The difference in solubility between exposed and non-exposed areas in the resist, which results from the action of the acid-catalysed reaction, depends upon the other components in the resist. If the compositions according to the invention comprise components that increase the solubility of the composition in the developer after irradiation and optionally after thermal aftertreatment, then it is a positive photoresist. The invention accordingly relates also to a positive photoresist.<br>
If, however, the components of the composition lower the solubility in the developer after irradiation and optionally after thermal aftertreatment, then it is a negative photoresist. The invention accordingly relates also to a negative photoresist.<br>
An overview of chemically enhanced photoresists can be found, for example, in: H. Ito, IBM Journal of Research and Development, Vol. 41, No. 1/2, page 69 (1997); H. Ito, SPIE Vol. 3678, page 2 (1999); for negative resists in: J.M. Shaw etal. IBM Journal of Research and Development, Vol. 41, No. 1/2, page 81 (1997).<br>
A monomeric, oligomeric or polymeric compound that, in non-exposed portions, lowers the rate of solubility of an alkali-soluble binder polymer also present in the resist formulation, and that is itself alkali-insoluble in the non-exposed portions, with the result that the resist film is retained in the non-exposed portions after development in an alkaline solution, but that is cleaved in the presence of an acid or is capable of being rearranged in such a manner that the reaction product becomes soluble in an alkaline developer, is referred to hereinafter as a solubility inhibitor.<br>
The invention also includes a chemically enhanced positive photoresist composition that can be developed in an alkaline medium, which photoresist composition comprises<br><br>
(a3) at least one polymer having acid-labile groups that decompose in the presence of an acid and increase the solubility of the resist film in an alkaline developer solution in the irradiated areas, and<br>
(b) at least one compound of formula I, II, III or IV.<br>
The invention relates also to a chemically enhanced positive photoresist composition that can be developed in an alkaline medium, which photoresist composition comprises (a4)  at least one monomeric or oligomeric solubility inhibitor having at least one acid-labile group that decomposes in the presence of an acid and that increases the solubility in aqueous-alkaline developer solutions, and at least one alkali-soluble polymer, and (b) at least one compound of formula I; II, III or IV.<br>
The invention relates also to a chemically enhanced positive photoresist composition that can be developed in an alkaline medium, which photoresist composition comprises (a3)  at least one polymer having acid-labile groups that decompose in the presence of an acid and increase the solubility in an aqueous-alkaline developer solution in the exposed area;<br>
(a4) a monomeric or oligomeric solubility inhibitor having at least one acid-labile group that decomposes in the presence of an acid and that increases the solubility in an aqueous-alkaline developer solution in the exposed area;<br>
(a5) an alkali-soluble monomeric, oligomeric or polymeric compound in a concentration that keeps the resist film in non-exposed areas completely insoluble in an alkaline developer, and (b) at least one compound of formula I, II, III or IV.<br>
The invention relates also to a chemically enhanced photoresist composition comprising (a3) at least one polymer having an acid-labile group that decomposes in the presence of an acid and increases the solubility in an aqueous-alkaline developer solution, and/or (a4) at least one monomeric or oligomeric solubility inhibitor having an acid-labile group that decomposes in the presence of an acid and increases the solubility in an aqueous-alkaline developer solution, and/or<br>
(a5) at least one alkali-soluble monomeric, oligomeric or polymeric compound; and (b) as photosensitive acid donor at least one compound of formula I, II, III or IV.<br>
The compositions may comprise, in addition to component (b), other photosensitive acid donors and/or other additives (c) and/or photosensitisers (d).<br>
Appropriate suitable additives (c) and photosensitisers (d) have been described hereinabove.<br><br>
Such chemically enhanced positive photoresist systems are described, for example, in E. Reichmanis, F. M. Houlihan, O. Nalamasu, T. X, Neenan, Chem. Mater. 1991, 3, 394; or in C. G. Willson, "Introduction to Microlithography, 2nd. Ed.; L S. Thompson, C. G. Willson, M. J. Bowden, Eds., Amer. Chem. Soc, Washington DC, 1994, p. 139. Suitable examples of acid-labile groups that decompose in the presence of an acid and form aromatic hydroxyl groups, carboxyl groups, keto groups and aldehyde groups and increase the solubility in aqueous-alkaline developer solutions include alkoxyalkyl ether groups, benzyl ether groups, tetrahydrofuranyl ether groups, tetrahydropyranyl ether groups, tert-alkyi ester groups, 2-methyl-2-adamantyl ester groups, 8-ethyl-8-tricyclo-decanyl ester groups, trityl ether groups, silyl ether groups, alkylcarbonate groups, such as, for example, tert-butyloxycarbonyloxy groups, trityl ester groups, silyl ester groups, alkoxy-methyl ester groups, cumyl ester groups, acetal groups, ketal groups, tetrahydropyranyl ester groups, tetrafuranyl ester groups, tertiary alkyl ether groups, tertiary alkyl ester groups, etc.. The polymers having functional groups that decompose under the action of an acid in order to increase the solubility of the resist film comprising that polymer in an alkaline developer solution and that can be added to the compositions of the present invention can carry the acid-labile groups in the polymer backbone and/or in the side chains. The acid-labile groups are preferably situated in the side chain of the polymer.<br>
Suitable polymers having acid-labile groups can be obtained by polymer-analogous reactions in which some or all of the alkali-soluble groups are converted into the acid-labile group in question. Also possible is the direct preparation by (co)polymerisation of monomers that already contain the acid-labile groups. Examples of the preparation have been published in EP 254853, EP 878738, EP 877293, JP 2-25850-A, JP 3-223860-A, and JP 4-251259-A.<br>
In polymers containing, for example, silyl ether, acetal, ketal and alkoxyalkyl ester groups (socalled low-activation energy blocking groups - protecting groups having low activation energy), such protecting groups are cleaved in the presence of an acid even at relatively low temperatures upon heating after exposure (generally between room temperature and 110°C). Polymers that carry tert-butyl ester groups, adamantyl ester groups or tert-butyloxycarbonyl groups (TBOC groups) or other ester groups that carry a secondary or tertiary carbon atom in addition to the oxygen atom of the ester bond (so-called high-activation energy blocking groups - protecting groups having high activation energy) generally require heating to achieve complete cleavage of the protecting groups in the presence of an acid after expo-<br><br>
sure. Hybrid systems in which both high-activation energy protecting groups and low-activation energy protecting groups are present in the same polymer can also be used. So-called "dual-mode" protecting groups are also known, which combine within them a readily cleavable bond, e.g. in an acetal group, and a bond that is more difficult to cleave, e.g. in a tert-butyl ester group, as described, for example, in "Proceedings of SPIE", Advances in Resist Technology and Processing XVII, Vol. 3999, Part One, pages 579-590, 28. Feb.-I. March 2000. Mixtures of polymers having different protecting group chemistry can also be used in the photosensitive compositions according to the invention.<br>
Preferred polymers having acid-labile protecting groups are polymers and copolymers comprising the following different monomer types:<br>
1)	monomers that contain acid-labile groups that decompose in the presence of an acid and increase the solubility in an aqueous-alkaline developer solution, and<br>
2)	monomers that are free of acid-labile groups and free of groups that contribute to the solubility in an alkaline solution, and/or<br>
3)	monomers that contribute to the aqueous-alkali solubility of the polymer.<br>
Examples of monomers of type 1) are those already described above as a suitable component (a2).<br>
Examples of comonomers of type 2) are:<br>
aromatic vinyl monomers, such as styrene, a-methylstyrene, acetoxystyrene, a-methyl-naphthalene, acenaphthalene, vinyl ethers, such as ethyl vinyl ether and 3,4-dihydro-2H-pyran, cyclohexylvinyl ether, cycloolefins, such as norbornene, 2-hydroxy-5-norbornene, 2-norbornen-5-yl-(2-hydroxyethyl)carboxylate, vinyl alicyclic compounds, such as vinyl norbor-nane, vinyl adamantane, vinyl cyclohexane, alkyl (meth)acrylates, such as methyl meth-acrylate, acrylonitrile, vinyl cyclohexane, vinyl cyclohexanol, and maleic acid anhydride. Examples of comonomers of type 3) are:<br>
vinyl aromatic compounds, such as hydroxystyrene, acrylic acid compounds, such as methacrylic acid, ethylcarbonyloxystyrene and derivatives thereof and cycloolefinic acids, such as 5-norbornene-2-carboxylic acid. Such polymers are described, for example, in US 5827634, US 5625020, US 5492793, US 5372912, EP 660187, US 5679495. EP 813113 and EP 831369. Further examples are crotonic acid, isocrotonic acid, 3-butenoic acid, acrylic acid, 4-pentenoic acid, propionic acid, 2-butynoic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid and<br><br>
acetylenecarboxylic acid. The polymers that are suitable in the composition according to the invention are not, however, limited to the examples given above.<br>
The content of acid-labile monomer in the polymer can vary within a wide range and is dependent upon the content of other comonomers and the alkali-solubility of the protected polymer. Generally the content of monomer having acid-labile groups in the polymer is from 5 to 60 mol %.<br>
The copolymers having acid-labile groups preferably have a Mw of from about 3000 to about 200 000, especially from about 5000 to about 50 000 and a molecular weight distribution of about 3 or less, especially about 2 or less. Non-phenolic monomers, e.g. a copolymer of alkyl acrylate, such as, for example, tert-butyl acrylate or tert-butyl methacrylate, and an alicyclic vinyl compound, such as a vinyl norbonanyl or vinylcyclohexanol compound, can be obtained by free-radical polymerisation or other known processes and advantageously have a Mw value of from about 8000 to about 50 000, and a molecular weight distribution of about 3 or less.<br>
Other comonomers can be added advantageously in a suitable amount in order, for example, to control the glass transition temperature or the like.<br>
In the present invention it is also possible to use mixtures of two or more polymers having acid-labile groups. For example, a mixture of polymers having acid-labile groups that cleave very readily, such as acetal groups or tetrahydropyranyloxy groups, and a polymer having acid-labile groups that cleave less readily, such as, for example, tertiary alkyl ester groups, can be used. It is also possible to use acid-labile groups of different sizes by mixing two or more polymers having different acid-labile groups, such as, for example, a tert-butyl ester group and a 2-methyl-adamantyl group or a 1-ethoxy-ethoxy group and a tetrahydropyranyloxy group. A mixture of non-crosslinked resin and crosslinked resin can also be used. According to the invention, the proportion of such polymers is preferably from about 30 to 99 % by weight, especially from 50 to 98 % by weight, based on the solids content. An alkali-soluble resin or an alkali-soluble monomeric or oligomeric compound without acid-labile groups can also be introduced into the composition, for example in order to control the alkali-solubility. Examples of polymer mixtures having different acid-labile groups can be found, for example, in EP 780732, EP 679951 and US 5817444.<br><br>
Monomeric and oligomeric solubility inhibitors (a4) are preferably used in the composition according to the invention.<br>
Suitable monomeric or oligomeric solubility inhibitors (a4) in the composition according to the invention are compounds having at least one acid-labile group that cleaves in the presence of acid and increases solubility in an aqueous-alkaline developer solution. Examples thereof include alkoxymethyl ether groups, tetrahydrofuranyl ether groups, tetrahydro-pyranyl ether groups, alkoxyethyl ether groups, trityl ether groups, silyi ether groups, alkylcarbonate groups, trityl ester groups, silyl ester groups, alkoxymethyl ester groups, vinyl carbamate groups, tertiary alkyl carbamate groups, tritylamino groups, cumyl ester groups, acetal groups, ketal groups, tetrahydropyranyl ester groups, tetrafuranyl ester groups, tertiary alkyl ether groups, tertiary alkyl ester groups, etc.. The molecular weight of the acid-cleavable solubility inhibitors suitable in the present invention is about 3000 or less, especially from about 100 to 3000, preferably from about 200 to 2500.<br>
Examples of monomeric and oligomeric solubility inhibitors having acid-labile groups are described, for example, as compounds of formulae (I) to (XVI) in EP 831369. Other suitable examples of such compounds are given in US 5356752, US 5037721, US 5015554, JP-A-1-289946, JP-A-1-289947, JP-A-2-2560, JP-A-3-128959, JP-A-3-158855, JP-A-3-179353, JP-A-3-191351, JP-A-3-200251, JP-A-3-200252, JP-A-3-200253, JP-A-3-200254, JP-A-3-200255, JP-A-3-259149, JA-3-279958, JP-A-3-279959, JP-A-4-1650, JP-A-4-1651, JP-A-11260, JP-A-4-12356, J P-A-4-123567, J P-A-1-289946, J P-A-3-128959, JP-A-3-158855, JP-A-3-179353, JP-A-3-191351, JP-A-3-200251, JP-A-3-200252, JP-A-3-200253, JP-A-3-200254, JP-A-3-200255, JP-A-3-259149, JA-3-279958, JP-A-3-279959, JP-A-4-1650, JP-A-4-1651, JP-A-11260, JP-A-4-12356, JP-A-4-12357 and Japanese Patent Application Nos. 3-33229, 3-230790, 3-320438, 4-254157, 4-52732, 4-103215, 4-104542, 4-107885, 4-107889, 4-152195, 4-254157, 4-103215, 4-104542, 4-107885, 4-107889 and 4-152195. Suitable for resists in the shortwave UV range are, for example, especially compounds such as tert-butyl cholate, tert-butyl deoxycholate and tert-butylcholate glutarate dimers (see, e.g., SPIE Vol. 3999, p. 127(2000).<br>
The composition according to the invention may also comprise polymeric solubility inhibitors, for example polyacetals, as described in US 5354643, or poly-N,0-acetals, as described in US 5498506, in combination with an alkali-soluble polymer, and also in combination with a polymer having acid-labile groups that increase the solubility of the resist film in the developer after exposure, or in a combination of the two types of polymer described.<br><br>
In the compositions according to the invention the content of solubility inhibitor is from about 3 to 55 % by weight, especially from about 5 to 45 % by weight, preferably from 10 to 35 % by weight, based on the solids content, when solubility inhibitors having acid-labile groups are used in combination with alkali-soluble polymers and/or polymers having acid-labile groups.<br>

The novolak compounds are obtainable, for example, by addition condensation reactions of one or more monomers as main constituent(s) with one or more aldehydes in the presence of an acid catalyst.

The average molecular weight of the resulting novolaks is advantageously in the range of about from 1000 to 30 000, preferably about from 2000 to 20 000.<br><br>
The poly(hydroxystyrenes), and derivatives and copolymers thereof, as described above as alkali-soluble polymers (other than novolak resins), advantageously have average molecular weights of from about 2000 or higher, especially from 4000 to 200 000, preferably from 5000 to 50 000. When a polymer film having improved heat-resistance is to be produced, the average molecular weight is advantageously at least 5000 or more.<br>
In the context of the present invention, the term "average molecular weight" is to be understood as the molar mass determined by gel permeation chromatography (calibrated with polystyrene standard).<br>
In the compositions according to the invention, the alkali-soluble polymers can be used in mixtures of two or more.<br>
Advantageously, the proportion of alkali-soluble polymer is up to 80 % by weight, especially up to 60 % by weight, preferably up to 40 % by weight, based on the solids content of the formulation (i.e. excluding solvent) when there is used a mixture of alkali-soluble polymer and a polymer that contains groups that decompose under the action of an acid in order to increase the solubility in an alkaline developer solution.<br>
When an alkali-soluble polymer is used together with a solubility inhibitor, without a polymer that has groups that decompose under the action of an acid, the proportion of alkali-soluble polymer is advantageously from 40 to 90 % by weight, especially from 50 to 85 % by weight, preferably from 60 to 80 % by weight.<br>
The proportion of compounds of formula I, II, Hi and IV (component(b)) in the positive resist formulation is advantageously from about 0.01 to 20 % by weight, based on the solids content in the photoresist.<br>
The use of the sulfonium salts of formula I, II, III and IV in chemically enhanced systems based on the principle of the removal of protecting groups from a polymer normally results in a positive resist. Positive resists are preferred to negative resists in many applications, especially because of their better resolution. There is, however, also interest in producing negative images using the positive resist mechanism, in order to combine the advantages of the good resolution of the positive resist with the properties of a negative resist. This is effected, for example, by the introduction of a so-called image-reversal step, as described, for example, in EP 361906. For that purpose, the resist material, after image-wise exposure, is treated, for example, with a gaseous base, before development, the acid that is formed being<br><br>
neutralised image-wise. The entire resist is then exposed and subjected to thermal treatment, and the negative image is developed in the customary manner.<br>
Acid-sensitive components that form negative resists are generally compounds that are capable of undergoing a crosslinking reaction with themselves and/or with one or more further components in the composition when they are catalysed by an acid (e.g. the acid formed by exposure of the compounds of formula I, II, III, IV according to the invention). Compounds of that kind are, for example, the known acid-curable resins, such as acrylate, polyester, alkyd, melamine, urea, epoxy and phenolic resins or mixtures thereof. Amino resins, phenolic resins and epoxy resins are especially suitable. Acid-curable resins of that kind are generally known and are described, for example, in "Ullmann's Encyclopadie der technischen Chemie", Edition 4, Vol. 15 (1978), pp. 613 - 628. The crosslinking components should advantageously be present in a concentration of about from 2 to 40 % by weight, preferably from 5 to 30 % by weight, based on the solids content of the negative resist formulation.<br>
The invention accordingly also includes a chemically enhanced negative photoresist that can be developed in an alkaline medium, which negative photoresist comprises (a6) an alkali-soluble resin as crosslinking component,<br>
(a7) a component that undergoes a crosslinking reaction with itself and/or with the crosslinking component under the action of acid, and (b) as photosensitive acid donor a compound of formula I.<br>
The composition may comprise, in addition to component (b), further photosensitive acid donors and/or further additives (c), and photosensitisers (d). Suitable components (c) and (d) have been described above.<br>
There come into consideration as component (a7) the compounds given above in the description of component (a1).<br>
Especially preferred acid-curable resins (a7) are amino resins, such as non-etherified or eth-erified melamine, urea, guanidine or biuret resins, especially methylated melamine resins or butylated melamine resins, suitable glycolurils (tetrahydroimidazo[4,5-d]imidazole-2,5-{1H,3hf)-6\ones) and urones. In this context, the term "resin" means both customary technical mixtures that generally also include oligomers, and pure and high-purity compounds. N-Hexa(methoxymethyl)melamine and tetramethoxymethylglucoril, and N,N'-dimethoxy-methylurone are the preferred acid-curable resins.<br><br>
The concentration of the compound of formula I, II, III or IV in the negative resist is advantageously from about 0.1 to 30 % by weight, especially up to 20 % by weight, preferably from 1 to 15 % by weight, based on the total solids content of the compositions.<br>
The negative resist compositions may optionally comprise a film-forming polymeric crosslink-ing agent (binder) (a6). This will preferably be an alkali-soluble phenolic resin. Also highly suitable for that purpose are, for example, novolaks derived from an aldehyde, e.g. acetalde-hyde or furfuraldehyde, especially from formaldehyde, and from a phenol, e.g. unsubstituted phenol, mono- or di-chlorosubstituted phenol, such as p-chloro-phenol, phenol mono- or di-substituted by CrCgalkyI, such as o-, m- or p-cresol, the various xylenols, p-tert-butylphenol, p-nonylphenol, p-phenylphenol, resorcinol, bis(4-hydroxy-phenyl)methane or 2,2-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)propane. Also suitable are homo- and co-polymers based on ethylenically unsaturated phenols, e.g. homopolymers of vinyl- and 1-propenyl-substituted phenols, such as p-vinylphenol or p-(1-propenyl)phenol or copolymers of those phenols with one or more ethylenically unsaturated compounds, e.g. styrenes. The proportion of crosslinking agent is generally within a range of about from 30 to 95 % by weight, especially from 40 to 80 % by weight.<br>
An especially preferred negative resist formulation comprises from 0.5 to 15 % by weight of a compound of formula I (component (b)), from 40 to 99 % by weight of a phenolic resin as crosslinking agent (component (a6)), and from 0.5 to 30 % by weight of a melamine resin (component (a7)), the percentages relating to the total solids content of the formulation.<br>
Compounds of formula I, II, III and IV can also be used as acid donors that can be activated photochemically for the crosslinking of, for example, poly(glycidyl) methacrylates in negative resist systems. Such crosslinking reactions are disclosed, for example, by Chae etaL in Pol-limo1993, 17(3), 292.<br>
The positive and negative photoresist formulations may comprise, in addition to component (b), further photosensitive acid donors (b1), further additives (c), sensitisers (d) and/or other photoinitiators (e).<br>
The invention accordingly also relates to chemically enhanced resist compositions, as described above, that comprise, in addition to components (a1) or (a2) and (b), or components<br><br>
(a3), (a4), (a5) and (b), or components (a6), (a7) and (b), further additives (c), further photosensitive acid donors (b1), other photoinitiators (e), and/or sensitisers (d).<br>
The compounds of formula I, II, III and IV can be used in the compositions according to the invention in combination with further known photolatent acid donors (b1), such as, for example, further onium salts, 6-nitrobenzylsulfonates, bis-sulfonyldiazomethane compounds, oxime sulfonates, etc.. Examples of known photolatent acids for chemically enhanced photoresists are to be found, for example, in US 5731364, US 5800964, EP 704762, US 5468589, US 5558971, US 5558976 and especially EP 794457 and EP 795786. When mixtures of compounds of formula I, II, III and IV (b) with other photolatent acids (b1) are used, the ratio of (b) to (b1) is, for example, from 1:99 to 99:1.<br>
The amount of photolatent acid in the formulations as given above refers to the whole contents of photolatent acid, i.e. (b)+(b1), if an additional photolatent acid (b1) is present.<br>
Examples of suitable photolatent acids (b1) include the examples of cationic photoinitiators and acid-formers as given above and<br>

e.g. 1,2-quinonediazidesulfonic acid ester compounds of polyhydroxy compounds. Preference is given to compounds having a 1,2-quinonediazidesulfonyl group, e.g. a 1,2-benzo-quinonediazide-4-sulfonyl group, a 1,2-naphthoquinonediazide-4-sulfonyl group, a 1,2-naphthoquinonediazide-5-sulfonyl group, a 1,2-naphthoquinonediazide-6-sulfonyl group, etc.. Special preference is given to compounds having a 1,2-naphthoquinonediazide-4-sulfonyl group or a 1,2-naphthoquinonediazide-5-sulfonyl group. Especially suitable are 1,2-quinonediazidesulfonic acid esters of (poly)hydroxyphenylarylketones, such as 2,3,4-trihydr-oxybenzophenone, 2,4,6-trihydroxybenzophenone, 2,3,4,4'-tetrahydroxybenzo-phenone, 2,2',3,4-tetrahydroxybenzophenone, 2,3,4,4'-tetrahydroxybenzophenone, 2,2',4,4'-tetrahydro-xybenzophenone, 2,2',3,4,4'-pentahydroxybenzophenone, 2,2',3,2,6'-pentahydroxybenzo-phenone, 2,3,3',4,4',5'-hexahydroxybenzophenone, 2,3',4,4',5',6-hexahydroxybenzophenone, etc.; 1,2-quinonediazidesulfonic acid esters of bis[(poly)-hydroxyphenyl]alkanes, such as bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethane, bis(2,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-ethane, 2,2-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)prop-ane, 2,2-bis(2,4-dihydroxyphenyl)propane, 2,2-bis(2,3,4-trihydroxyphenyl)propane, etc.; 1,2-quinonediazidesulfonic acid esters of (poly)hydroxyphenylalkanes, such as 4,4'-dihydroxytri-phenylmethane, 4,4',4"-trihydroxy-triphenylmethane, 4,4',5,5'-tetramethyl-2,2',2"-trihydroxytri-phenylmethane, 2,2,5,5'-tetramethyl-4,4',4'*-trihydroxytriphenylmethane, 1,1,1-tris(4-hydroxy-phenyl)ethane, 1,1-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)-1-phenylethane, 1,1-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)-1-(4-[1-(hydroxyphenyl)-1-methylethyl]phenyl)ethane, etc; 1,2-quinonedia2idesulfonic acid esters of (poly)hydroxy-phenylflavanes, such as 2,4,4-trimethyl-2',4',7-trihydroxy-2-phenylflavane, 2,4,4-trimethyl-2',4',5',6,7-pentahydroxy-2-phenylflavane, etc..<br>

Further examples of basic organic compounds that can be used in the resist compositions according to the present invention are compounds that are stronger bases than phenol, especially nitrogen-containing bases. Such compounds may be ionic, such as tetraalkyl-am-monium salts, or non-ionic. Preference is given to nitrogen-containing bases that, per molecule, have two or more nitrogen atoms in different chemical environments. Special preference is given to compounds comprising at least one substituted or unsubstituted amino group and at least one nitrogen-containing ring structure, as well as to compounds having at least one alkylamino group. Examples thereof include guanidine, aminopyridine, aminoal-kylpyridines, aminopyrrolidine, indazole, imidazole, pyrazole, pyrazine, pyrimidine, purine, imidazoline, pyrazoline, piperazine, aminomorpholine and aminoalkylmorpholines.

Preferred substituents are amino groups, aminoalkyi groups, alkylamino groups, aminoaryl groups, aryl-amino groups, alky! groups, alkoxy groups, acyl groups, acyloxy groups, aryl groups, aryloxy groups, nitro, hydroxy and cyano. Specific examples of especially preferred basic compounds are guanidine, 1,1-dimethylguanidine, 1,1,3,3-tetramethylguanidine, 2-amino-pyridine, 3-aminopyrid-ine, 4-aminopyridine, 2-dimethylaminopyridine, 4-dimethylamino-pyridine, 2-diethylaminopyri-dine, 2-(aminomethyl)pyridine, 2-amino-3-methylpyridine, 2-amino-4-methylpyridine, 2-amin-o-5-methylpyridine, 2-amino-6-methylpyridine, 3-amino-ethylpyridine, 4-aminoethylpyridine, 3-aminopyrrolidine, piperazine, N-(2-aminoethyl)-piperazine, N-(2-aminoethyl)piperidine, 4-amino-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine, 4-piperidinopiperidine, 2-iminopiperidine, 1-(2-aminoeth-yl)pyrrolidine, pyrazole, 3-amino-5-methylpyrazole, 5-amino-3-methyl-1-p-tolylpyrazole, pyrazine, 2-(aminomethyl)-5-methyl-pyrazine, pyrimidine, 2,4-diaminopyrJmidine, 4,6-dihydr-oxypyrimidine, 2-pyrazoline, 3-pyrazoline, N-aminomorpholine and N-(2-aminoethyl)morphol-ine.<br>
Other examples can be found in DE 4408318, US 5609989, US 5556734, EP 762207, DE 4306069, EP 611998, EP 813113, EP 611998 and US 5498506. The basic compounds suitable for the compositions according to the invention are not limited, however, to those described above.<br>
The nitrogen-containing basic compounds may be used alone or in a combination of two or more. The proportion of those compounds is generally about from 0.001 to 10 parts by weight, especially from 0.01 to 5 parts by weight, per 100 parts by weight of the photosensitive composition according to the invention (without the solvent). The composition may also comprise an organic basic compound that decomposes under the action of actinic radiation ("suicide base"), as described, for example, in EP 710885, US 5663035, US 5595855, US 5525453 and EP 611998.<br>
Suitable examples of dyes (c) are those mentioned above as well as oil-soluble dyes and basic dyes, e.g. Oil Yellow #101, Oil Yellow #103, Oil Pink #312, Oil Green BG, Oil Blue BOS, Oil Blue #603, Oil Black BY, Oil Black BS, Oil Black T-505 (all from Orient Chemical Indus-thes Ltd., Japan), crystal violet (CI42555), methyl violet (CI 42535), rhodamine B (CI 45170B), malachite green (CI 42000) and methylene blue (CI52015).<br>

Suitable sensitisers are not, however, limited to those examples.<br>
Such sensitisers can also be used as photoabsorbers for the absorption of specific UV rays emitted by light sources. In that case, the photoabsorber reduces the reflection of light from the substrate and lessens the effect of multiple reflection inside the resist film. This reduces the effect of standing waves.<br>
Further suitable additives (c) are acid-amplifiers, compounds that accelerate the formation of acid or increase the acid concentration. Such compounds can be used in the resist compositions according to the invention, but can also be advantageous in other applications for the compositions according to the invention, such as in coatings. Examples of such compounds are described by Arimitsu, K. etal. in J. Photopolym. Sci. Technol. 1995, 8, p. 43ff.; by Kudo, K. et aL in J. Photopolym. Sci. Technol. 1995, 8, p. 45ff.; by W. Huang et aL in SPIE Vol. 3999, pp. 591-597 (2000) and by Ichimura, K. etaL in Chem: Letters 1995, p. 551ff.<br>
Normally the compositions according to the invention are dissolved in a suitable solvent before application to the substrate. Examples of such solvents include ethylene dichloride, cyclohexanone, cyclopentanone, 2-heptanone, y-butyrolactone, methyl ethyl ketone, ethylene glycol monomethyl ether, ethylene glycol monoethyl ether, 2-methoxyethyl acetate, 2-ethoxyethyl acetate, 2-ethoxyethanol, diethyl glycol dimethyl ether, ethylene glycol mono-ethyl ether acetate, propylene glycol monomethyl ether, propylene glycol monomethyi ether acetate, toluene, ethyl acetate, methyl lactate, ethyl lactate, methylmethoxy propionate, ethylethoxy propionate, methyl pyruvate, ethyl pyruvate, propyl pyruvate, N,N-dimethyl-formamide, dimethyl sulfoxide, N-methylpyrrolidone and tetrahydrofuran. Such solvents can be used individually or in combinations.   Preferred examples thereof are esters, such as 2-methoxyethyl acetate, ethylene glycol monoethyl ether acetate, propylene glycol mono-methyl ether acetate, methylmethoxy propionate, ethylethoxy propionate and ethyl lactate.<br>
A surfactant may be added to the solvent. Examples of suitable surfactants are non-ionic surfactants, such as polyoxyethylene alkyl ethers, e.g. polyoxyethylene lauryl ether, poly-oxyethylene stearyl ether, polyoxyethylene acetyl ether and polyoxyethylene oleyl ether; polyoxyethylene alkyl aryl ethers, e.g. polyoxyethylene octyl phenol ether and polyoxyethylene nonyl phenol ether; polyoxyethylene/polyoxypropylene block copolymers, sorbitol/fatty acid esters, e.g. sorbitol monolaurate, sorbitol monopalmitate, sorbitol monostearate, sorbitol monooleate, sorbitol trioleate; fluorochemical surfactants, such as F-top EF301, EF303 and EF352 (New Akita Chemical Company, Japan), Megafac F171 and F17.3 (Dainippon Ink &amp; Chemicals, Inc,. Japan), Fluorad FC 430 and FC431 (Sumitomo #3M Ltd., Japan), Asahi Guard AG710 and Surflon S-382, SC101, SC102, SC103, SC104, SC105 and SC106 (Asahi Glass Col, Ltd., Japan); organosiloxane polymer KP341 (Shin-Etsu Chemical Co., Ltd., Japan); and acrylic or methacrylic (co)polymers Poly-flow Now.75 and N0.95 (Kyoeisha Chemical Co., Ltd., Japan). Generally the proportion of surfactant in the composition is about 2 parts by weight or less, e.g. 0.1 part by weight or less, per 100 parts by weight of solids content in the composition. The surfactants may be used individually or in combinations.<br>
The solution of the composition according to the invention is applied uniformly to a substrate by means of generally known methods already described above. Suitable layer thicknesses have also already been indicated above.<br>
After coating, the solvent is usually removed by heating and a layer of the photoresist remains on the substrate. The drying temperatures must, of course, be lower than the temperatures at which constituents of the resist formulation can decompose or react Normally the drying temperatures vary within a range of about from 60 to 160°C.<br>
The exposure of the coated substrates has already been described above. After exposure and, if necessary after the thermal treatment, the exposed sites of the composition (in the case of the positive resist) or the non-exposed sites of the composition (in the case of the negative resist) are removed using a developer in a manner generally known to a person skilled in the art.<br>
In order to accelerate the catalytic reaction and thus to ensure the development of a sufficient difference in solubility between exposed and non-exposed areas of the resist coating, the coating is preferably heated before development. It is also possible to carry out heating during the exposure. Generally temperatures of from 60 to 160°C are used. The optimum duration of heating depends upon the heating method used and can be determined by the person skilled in the art by simple experiments. It normally ranges from a few seconds to several minutes, e.g. from 10 to 300 seconds when a heating plate is used, and, e.g., from 1 to 30 minutes when a circulated-air oven is used.<br>
Development is then carried out, wherein the portions of the coating that are soluble in the developer are removed. If necessary, the development step can be accelerated by gentle movement of the sample, careful brushing of the coating in the developer bath or by development in a spray developing apparatus. Aqueous-alkali developer fluids customary in the art can be used for that purpose. Examples thereof include sodium and potassium hydroxide, the corresponding carbonates, hydrogen carbonates, silicates and metasilicates, metal-free bases, such as ammonium compounds, or amines, such as ethylamine, n-propylamine, diethylamine, di-n-propylamine, triethylamine, methyldiethylamine, alkanolamines, e.g. di-methylethanolamine, triethanolamine, quaternary ammonium hydroxides, e.g. tetramethyl-ammonium hydroxide or tetraethylammonium hydroxide. The developer solutions are normally up to 0.5N, but are generally diluted before use in a suitable manner. For example, solvents having a normality of about from 0.1 to 0.3 are very suitable. The choice of developer will depend upon the nature of the photocurable coating, especially upon the nature of the crosslinking agent or the resulting photolysis products. The aqueous developer solutions may, if necessary, also comprise small amounts of wetting agents and/or organic solvents. Examples of typical organic solvents that may be added to the developer solutions include cyclohexanone, 2-ethoxyethanol, toluene, acetone, isopropanol and mixtures of two or more such solvents. A typical aqueous/organic developer system is a system based on Butylcel-losolve"™/water.<br>
The invention relates also to a method of manufacturing a photoresist by<br>
(1)	applying a composition as described above to a substrate;<br>
(2)	heating the composition to a temperature of from 60°C to 160°C;<br>
(3)	carrying out image-wise exposure with light of a wavelength of from 150 nm to 1500 nm;<br>
(4)	optionally heating the composition to temperatures of from 60°C to 160°C; and<br><br>
(5) subsequently developing with a solvent or an aqueous alkaline developer.<br>
The photoresist compositions can be used on all types of substrate and with all irradiation techniques known to the person skilled in the art. For example, semiconductor substrates can be used, such as silicon, gallium arsenide, germanium, indium antimonide; also substrates covered by oxide or nitride layers, such as silicon dioxide, silicon nitride, titanium nitride, siloxanes, and metal substrates and metal-coated substrates coated with metals such as aluminium, copper, tungsten, etc.. The substrate can also be coated with polymeric materials, for example with organic antireflective coatings, insulation layers and dielectric coatings made of polymeric materials.<br>
The photoresist layer can be irradiated by all customary techniques, such as direct writing, i.e. with a laser beam or projection lithography in step-and repeat mode or scanning mode, or by contact printing through a mask.<br>
In the case of projection lithography, a large number of optical conditions can be selected, such as coherent, partially coherent or incoherent radiation. This includes non-axial irradiation techniques, for example annular illumination and quadrupolar irradiation where the radiation is allowed to pass through only certain regions of the lens, excluding the centre of the lens.<br>
The mask used to produce the pattern can be a hard mask or a flexible mask. The mask can include transparent, semi-transparent and opaque patterns. The pattern size can include also patterns that are at or below the resolution limit of the projection optics and are arranged on the mask in a certain manner in order to modify the aerial image, intensity and phase modulation of the radiation after having it has passed through the mask. This includes phase-shift masks and half-tone phase-shift masks.<br>
The process for forming an image on the photoresist composition can be used to generate patterns of any desired geometry and shape, for example dense and isolated lines, contact holes, channels, incisions, dots, etc..<br>
Preference is given to a method wherein the image-wise exposure is effected by monochromatic or polychromatic radiation in the wavelength range of from 190 to 450 nm, especially from 190 to 260 nm.<br>
The invention relates also to the use of compounds of formula I, II, III and IV as described above as photolatent acid donors in the polymerisation or crosslinking of cationically or acid-catalytically polymerisable or crosslinkable compounds or to increase the solubility of compounds that increase their solubility in a developer under the action of acid, and also to a method for the photopolymerisation or crosslinking of cationically or acid-catalytically polymerisable or crosslinkable compounds under the action of electromagnetic radiation, in which method a compound of formula I is used as photolatent acid donor. A further subject of the invention is a method as described above in the manufacture of surface-coating compositions including scratch-resistant coatings, stain-resistant coatings, anti-fog coatings, stain resistant coatings, anticorrosion coatings, powder coating compositions, printing inks, non impact printing inks including ink jet printing inksprinting plates, dental compounds including composites, stereolithography resins, adhesives, anti-adhesive coatings (release coatings), conformal coatings, optical fiber coatings, colour filters, resist materials or image-recording materials including holography resins.<br>
The composition according to the present invention, comprising a cationic photoinitiator of the formula I, II, III or IV may also be employed in a vacuum deposition process as described in WO 02/064268. That is, the photoinitiators are suitable to be flash-evaporated vacuum-deposited. Accordingly, in a process for forming a solid poylmeric structure from flash-evaporated vacuum-deposited cationically curable monomeric material, comprising the steps (i)   preparing a mixture of a cationically-curable monomer with a thermally stable, chemically inactive at room temperature, cationic photoinitiator; (ii)   flash-evaporating said mixture in a vacuum to produce a vapor; (iii) condensing the vapor to produce a film; and<br>
(iv) exposing said film to a radiation source to produce a polymeric solid film, said photoinitiator is of the formula I, II, III or IV as decribed above.<br>
Suitable apparatus for said procedure, as wel as details concerning the monomers are described in WO 02/064268, the teachings of which are incorporated by reference.<br>
The UV irradiation to release the acid is generally effected with light of a wavelength of from 157 to 600 nm. Suitable radiation is present, for example, in sunlight or light from artificial light sources. A large number of widely varying types of light source may be used.   Point sources and also planiform radiators (lamp carpets) are suitable. Examples thereof include: carbon arc lamps, xenon arc lamps, medium-, high- and low-pressure mercury lamps, doped where appropriate with metal halides (metal halide lamps), microwave-excited metal vapour lamps, excimer lamps, superactinic fluorescent tubes, fluorescent lamps, argon incandescent lamps, flashlamps, photographic flood lights, light emitting diodes (LED), electron beams and X-rays.<br>
The distance between the lamp and the substrate to be exposed can vary according to the intended use and the type and strength of the lamp and may be, for example, from 2 cm to 150 cm. Laser light sources, for example excimer lasers, are also suitable. Lasers in the visible range can also be used.<br>
The examples which follow illustrate the invention in more detail. Parts and percentages are, as in the remainder of the description and in the claims, by weight, unless stated othenA^ise. Where alkyl radicals having more than three carbon atoms are referred to without any mention of specific isomers, the n-isomers are meant in each case<br>

Example 28:<br>
A composition is prepared by mixing the following components:<br>

Chemical) 11.73 parts    of 3-ethyl-3-hydroxymethyl-oxetane (UVR 6000, provided by Dow Chemical) 5.92 parts    of e-caprolactane triol (Tone Polyol 301, provided by Dow Chemical) 0.56 parts    of a silicon surface additive (Byk 307, provided by BYK) 100.0 parts 1% of the compound of example 2 is stirred into said formulation, which then is applied with a layer thickness of 30|im onto a white chipboard. Curing is effected by irradiation with a 1x120 W/cm medium pressure mercury lamp (1ST), aluminum reflector, by passing the sample under the lamp on a conveyor belt at a speed of 20m/min.<br>
The yellowing of the cured sample is determined by measuring the b* (CIE lab) value after the irradiation and after 16h of additional exposure to a fluorescent tube (TLK40/05). The initial b* value is 3.8, while said value after 16 h of additional exposure is 4.4.<br>
Example 29:<br>
Into a formulation as decribed in example 28 2% of the compound of example 6 are stirred. The composition is then applied with a 4^m wire bar onto an aluminum film (85^m). Curing is effected by moving the sample on a conveyor belt under an 1x120 W/cm medium pressure<br><br>
mercury lamp (1ST) fitted wit an aluminum reflector. Curing is tested by dry-rub resistance with Tela™ tissue paper. Belt speed is varied by 10 m/min steps. The higher the reactivity of the photoinitiator, the faster the belt can be moved to achieve a cured coating. With the described composition a cured coating is achieved even when the conveyor belt is moved with a speed of 200 m/min.<br>
Using the photoinitiator compounds of examples 19 and 20 in the photocurable formulation, a belt speed of 200 m/min is achieved. With the photoinitiator compound of example 21 in the photocurable formulation, a belt speed of 180 m/min is achieved<br>
