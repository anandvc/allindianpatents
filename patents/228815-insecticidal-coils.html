This invention rclaies to moulded combustible products that emanate a pesticide into the atmosphere on combustion and more paiticularly to such products that undergo combusUon for a prolonged period tliercby providmg an extended time period of pestlcida! activity,<br>
Back ground Art<br>
The kind of products to which this invention relates are commonly referred ;o as "mosquito coils". Such coils are characterised by being formed from a combustible material which is shaped into a circular helix. Included in the combustible material are one or more pesticides, which in the case of products active against mosquitoes will be insecticides. As the product bums, the insecticides ars emanated into the atmosphere by virtue of their volatility. Ideally, such coils will provide an effeative ievtl of insecticide in the atisospheie for an appropriate time period.<br>
TypicaJiy, mosquito coils are "used in environments where persons sleep and arc fterefore unable to destroy mosquitoes befoi'e being bitten. Another usage is environments where infants or others incapable or having a limited ability of destroying allacking mosquitoes are placed.<br>
It will be readily appreciated that mosquitoes are vectors for :i number of particularly persistent and often life-threatening or at least debilitating diseases. Most significant among these diseases is malaria. It is therefore highly desirable to prevent mosquito bites as a means of preventing the contracting of such diseases.<br>
Mosquitoes are particularly prevalent m trupical and sub-tropical regions. Many of these regions include countties with relatively low per capita incomes. It is therefore desirable to be able to provide pesticidal prochiits that are highly cost effective. In general terms, traditional mosquito coils fulfil this role. They are relatively easy lo form and include tow cost ingredients. As emanation of the insecticide is only dependant on combustion of the coil, the only source of energy required is sufficient heat to mitially ignite a coil to cause it to combust.   However, one feature that is<br><br>
lacking in such coils is the ability to reliably provide a period of stlfEcient insecti;idal activity while a person sleeps ovemiglit. Typically coils should provide up to about 8 hours of insccticidal coverage. However, due to breakage, it is not uncommon tor a CO)] to bum for a significantly shorter period of time. This requires that a person sleeping awaJcc and recognise that the coil is not burning, then carefully leligh: the unbroken portion whilst ensuring that it is inract and correctly mounted. Sw^h a requirement is not conducive to maintaining an effective overnight coverage agitnst mosquito bites.<br>
At this point it is wortli noting that traiHtiona! mosquito coils are formed as planar circular helices in a moulding or other shaping process. At the terminal ccd of the coil, approximately in the centre, is a small aperture which is used to locate the mosquito coil on an upstanding pin. The upstanding pin usually projects out of a dish or tray wliich is used to collect the ashes of the combusted coil. Locating of the coJl on the pin results in the coil separating out so "as to form a continuous spiral with the beginning of the coil, which is where ctnnbustfon commences, at a point lower than tha terminal end which sits on tlic locating pin. In this way the continuous spiral fonns a track which combusts trom the outer beginning eid to the mounted terminal end.<br>
It should be appreciated that mosquito coils may also be formed as double circular helices. In these structures, the helices are formed co-tcrminously. However, prior to use, each helix must be separated out. One important reason for produi:ing coils in this way is that of economical use of available material as wcU as eas: of formation in manufacture.<br>
As mentioned above, typically mosqulta coils are subject to breakage. This arises out of the fact that they are quite brittle and during manufacture, rather 'lian being produced in a planar form, coils may warp to assume a wavy or convex conformation. In some cases, a free end or tip of the coil may curl upwardly, ft is therefore well recognised that breakage may occur during manufacture, packaging, transport and in use by a consumer. In this latter case, it is important that a consumer exercise considerable care in both opening and mounting a coil. More especially in the case of double helical coils, care must be taker, in separating out each coil so as to<br><br>
avoid breakage.   Again it tnusl be emphasised iliat any breakage of a coil effectively results in a coil being shortened both in length and most significantly, burn time.<br>
Another knovMi method of making mosquito coils is by treating thick piecss of cardboard with an insecticide. The cardboard may be made of layers of thinner sheets which are slacked on top of one another until the desired thickness is achieved. The multi-layered cardboard is then Cut to the required shape of the coil. While this msthod reduces the breakage of the coij, the cutting of the thick cardboard results iii the damage and breakage of the cutting knives. TTIC costs associated with the reijulai replacement of the knives is significant<br>
Whilst recognising the short comings of traditional mosquilo coils, the pn^sent inventors have sought to provide an improved coil which is capable of providMg a prolonged effective period of insecticida! coverage and is produced in a manner resulting in a cost effective product relative to the traditional coil.<br>
This has been achieved by recognising that rather than forming the coils as planar helices which need to be handled wnth rome care, the coils are moulded to a form which significantly reduces the chance of breakage and does not involve cuiting thick cardboard, Dtsclosiye of Invention<br>
Accordingly, in a first aspect the present invention consists in a combusHble pesticidal product comprising a structural element having a thickness defined by sides which slope at an angle of from 5 to 10 degrees iind formed of a vacuum moulded pulp of organic fibrous material, su,;h as cellulose fibres,  including<br>
wood free fibres, or mixtures thereof, the product mcluding one or more pesticides, which product on combustion emanates the pesticide info the atmosphere.<br>
In a second aspect, the present ioventioii consists in 'a method of making a combustible pesiicidal product comprising the steps of;<br>
forming a pulp of organic fibrous materiav, such as cellulose fibres,   including<br>
wood free fibrcfi, or   mixtures thereof,<br>
the addition of one or more pesticides, and<br>
moulding the product by vacuum moulduig<br>
to form a combustible pesticidal prod;jct.<br><br>
Throughout this specification the worJ "comprise", or variations SUQI as "comprises" or "comprising", will be undcr3tO'3d to imply the inclusion of a s:ated element, integer or step, or group of elements, integers or steps, but not the exclusicm of any other element, integer or step, or group of elements, integers or steps.<br>
For the purposes of describing this invention, reference will be made to mosquito coils, although it must be appreciated that this invention is not so-limited.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the product is formed by moulding a pulp into the desired shape. Typically the shape will be helical although not necessarily circular.<br>
The pulp is moulded into the shape of f, mosquito coil by vacuum mouUling, preferably thcrmofonning.<br>
Vacuum moulding involves feeding a pulp product into a hydropulper to fo,rm a solution, a mould covered by a mesh screen bsing lowered into the solution, and a vacuum being applied to the mould. The use of the vacuum causes fibres to be drawn to the surface of the mould, being a single immersion, or if necessary a number of ininiersioMs, and once a sufficient fibre depth is drawn onto the mould the moti d is removed from the solulion, the vacuum then being used to dewater the pulp. Vacaum moulding can be undertaken at any pressure less than atmospheric pressure however it is more preferable that the pressure is 0-20kPa fabs) to reduce processing times, T.iese pressures are absolute, ic. the true total pressure of the system that is causing the pulp to form on the mesh. The maximum vacuum achievable is OkPa (abs), wliilst atmospheric pressure is 101.3 kPa (at sea level and 0°C). The product may then be transferred from the mould to another mould, w ith or without compression and dried either in or out of the mould. Methods of drying include but are not limited to direct heat, microwaves or exposure to sunlight. The product is then pressed to the required density cither within the mould or after the product has been transferred from the mould.<br>
The tlicrmofomiing process is similar to vacuum moulding in tliat a mould covered by a mesh screen Is immersed into a pulp solution and a vacuum is applied to the mould. After a sufficient fibre depth has beeii drawn onto the mould it is remcved from the solution. This mould is then pressed eitfier mechanically or pneumatically or a combination thereof, between a corresponding transfer mould to remove water. This<br><br>
transfer mould may be heated and may also have a vacuum applied to it to aid dewatering. The product may then be held in this transfer mould and moved to am^thej mould for fiirtlier processing. Furlhw processing may include coiDpression befveen heated or unheatcd moulds. Transference of the product from mould to mould wn be achieved using coTtiprcsscd air aivd vacuums. The product is dried in the mould using pressures of between 50 to ISOOkPa, preferably 200 to gOOkPa, most preferably 400kPa and at a temperature of between 80 to 400°C, preferably ZSCC. The product may undergo further piocessing, for example, stamping or pressing to improve the prcduct qualities.<br>
There arc also many permutalions for forming the product using both vacuum moulding and iheimoforniing techniques in diffi^rent processing orders. Some of these permutations could include;<br>
pressing and heating the product at the sarne time or separately,<br>
pressing the product after or before drying.<br>
partially drying the product then pressing, preferably followed by further drying,<br>
using heated or unhealed moulds,<br>
drying the product cither in or out of the mould,<br>
using mechanical or pneumatic means to press and transfer products,<br>
using vacuums and/or compressed aii being heated or unheated to aid in de watering.<br>
To aid transfer of the pulp product from the mould, the sides of the mould may be slightly tapered. An angle of 0-30 degrees, preferably 5-10 degrees is commonly used and is lenned the 'draft angle'.<br>
The advantages of thcrmoforming over mosl other methods of processing include high output rates, good quality physical properties in fmished parts, namely a smooth surface fmish on both sides of the product, density control, and thickness control, and less space and energy requirements as tiiere is no need for a drying oveu.<br>
The   pulp   can   be  manufactured  from  readily   available   and   inexpcn.iive combustible organic fibrous materials, such as   cellulose fibres   including wood free fibres. Examples,<br>
without limitation include waste paper and cardboard, old newspaper, kratt pulp, coconut powder, straw, bagasse, bamboo, cant;, grasses, weeds, tea (eaves,<br><br>
charcoal powder, sawdust, cotton, cloths, rags,, and husks of materials Such as rice, wheat and coconuts. Preferablj'. old newspaper is used.<br>
^'hiJst this invention is appUcable to ;, variety of pesticidal substances, the preferred form relates to the use of insecticides, particularly insecticides tha: are cflective against mosquitoes.<br>
The insecticides used in this invention comprise all residual insecticides, including non-microencapsulated insecticides, microencapsulated insecticides as well as mixtures of non-micrOencapsulatcd and microencapsulated insecticides.<br>
It is preferred that the one or more insecticides comprise substances which are toxic to mosquitoes. Without limitation, these include esbiothrin, d-allcthrin, prallethrin, tratisnuthrin, bioallcthrin, esbioalleti'irin, pyiethrins, citronella, pyrethroids, neem oil and mixtures thereof When esbiothrin, d-allethrin, prallethrin, transflutirin, bioallethrin, esbioallethrin. pyrethrins, and mixtures thereof are used, typically they will be in an amount of from 0.01 to 0.6 % w/w. preferably to 0.02 to 0.3 % w/w, most preferably 0.04 10 O.l % w/w. When neem oil, citronella and mixlures thereof are used, typically they will be in an amount of from 0.01 to 10 % w/w, preferably to O.Ol to 6 % w/w, most preferably 0.04 to 6 % w/w.<br>
Emanation of the pesticide intotlie atmosphere occurs as a result of the pesticide being volatilised as the coil burns. At the front or tip of combustion of a coil, the temperature may be 200-500'C. However, bciiind the tip, the temperature will be somewhat lower owing to dte insulation properties of the pulp. This means that compounds such as esbiothrin which boil at 160-170°C will be volatised and releiised into the atmosphere behind the burning lip.<br>
The pulp may include an accelerant, being an alkali or alkali earth metal nitrate or nitrite in an amount of from 0.04 to 1.83 % w/w. Preferably, the alkali or alkali earth metal nitrate or nitrate will be included in an amount of from 0.20 to 1.20 % v//w, most preferably about 1.11 % w/w. The nitrates or nitrites that may be used include sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium and mixtures thereof. It is preferred to utilise potassium as the nitrate or the nitrite, preferably as the nitrate.<br>
As an alternative to Ihe alkali or alkali earth metal nitrate or nitrite, rhe pulp may include an alkali or alkali earth carbonate or bicarbonate in an amount of from Q.O.I tg<br><br>
1.83 % w/w. Preferably the alkali or alkali earth metal carbonate or bicarbocaie will be included in an amount of fiom O.IO to I.OO % w/w, most preferably about 0.82 % w/w. The carbonates or bicarbonates that may be used include sodium, potassium, calcium, magJiesium and mixtures thereof. It is preferred to use potassium carbonate.<br>
Sodium silicate may be included in the pulp in an amount of fiom 0.01 to 1.37 % w/w. Preferably, the sodium silicate may be included in an amount of from O..i0 to 0,70 % w/w, most preferably about 0.56 % w/w.<br>
A phosphate in an amount of from 0.01 to 0.40 % w/w and selected from the ^oup consisting of diammonium phospiiatc. monoairunonium phosphate, tiiammoiiium phosphate and mixtures thereof may be included in the pulp. Preferably the phosphate may be included in an amount of from 0,02 to 0.40 % w/w, most preferably aboiit 0.14 % w/w, Furthennore, of these phosphates, diammonium phosphate is preferred.<br>
A boron compound in an amount of from 0,01 to 0,92 % w/w and selected from the group consisting of boric acid, sodium tetraborate hydrous, sodium borate, potassium borate, calcium borate, zinc perborate, boronatrocalcite and mixtures thereof may be included in the pulp. Preferably the boron compound may be JacJuded M an amount of from 0,10 to 0,70 % w/w, most preferably about 0.66 % w/w. Furthermore, of tliese boron compounds, sodium borate is preferred.<br>
It is within the scope of this invention to include a perfume and/or a dye. Both the perfume and the dye, if included, will be selected on the basis of satisfying sp&amp;iitic organoleptic requirements. It wiU of course be appreciated that the pei^mc must be suitably stable under the conditions of combustion of the coil.<br>
The thickness and width of the pulp are cf great importance in determining the bum rate of the coil. It is desired to have a coil which has a low bum rate as less mass is required in the coll. In a preferred embodiment, the structural element is made from moulded pulp, with dimensions of 3-lOnun wi'ie by l-6mm thick, preferably 6[nin wide and 4mm (hick. The desired length is &amp;om 500 to 1500mm, preferably llOOrnm. The cross-sectional combustion area is shaped tn a rectangle, triangle, square, half-circle, u section or combinations thereof. Where ihe coil is a single heiscal coil, the weight of the single coil is 8 to 20 grams, preferably 12 grams.<br><br>
It has been found that the density of the pulp is also of importance. To acl lieve appropriate bum times, the pulp has.a density of 300-lOOOkg/m', preferably 400-600kg/in*, most preferably 600ke/m'. Low densities bum too rapidly, while high densities have difficulty sustaining combustion. A density of about 600k.g/m^ is preferred as ihe relatively high density provides rigidity to the coil and ensures thai the coti does not need to be too large in size. Co:)s with a defisity over 60l)kg/m^ wi!l sustain combustion by adding accelerants to the pulp. However, the use of acceleiants increases the bum rate of the coil.<br>
Other components that may be added to the pulp or applied as a coating after tbe product has dried include binders, dcwaterlng agents, chemicals to increase the wcl and dry strength of the product, starches, for example. Tapioca, Tamarind and corn; gums, for example, guar, arable and xanthan; lalc, and glues, for example, PYA. Typically, starch Is present in an amouni of from 5 to 15% w/w. All other components mentioned may be present in amounts of less than 1% w/w.<br>
Broadly speaking, the various materials to be included in the pulp may be ether incorporated during the preparation of the pulp, applied as a coating after the moulded pulp product has been formed or both incorpc'tated and applied as a coating. It is preferable that the materials ajc applied as a costing after the forming of the moulded product.<br>
When a coating is applied, it is important to note that certain of the materials cannot be dissolved in the same solution for coating purposes due to an mcompatibility of ingredients. For example, the alkali earth metal nitrate or nitrite and ihe sodiurn sihcate may be dissolved in the same aqueous solution. Likewise, the alkali nielal carbonate or bicarbonate and the sodium silicate; tJie alkali metal nitrate or nitrite and the phosphate and the alkali metal nitrate or nitrite may each be dissolved in the same aqueous solution.<br>
Whilst the atbremenlioncd materials may be applied as aqueous solutions, the one or more pesticides and the perfume are not generally water soluble, Accordingly, either or both of thcsc materials may be added to the aqueous solution of the other materials along with sm emulsifier to ensure that ihey are uniformly dispersed.<br><br>
Alternatively, they may be dissolved in a solvent and separately applied either before or after the aqueous coating(s).<br>
The inclusion of a dye is optional and depending on the selected dyes solubility may be incorporated in an aqueous solution or in a suitable solvent for sepjirate addition as a coating. If it is incorporated in a non-aqueous solvent, then preferably the solvent will be chosen to dissolve the perfume aiid the one or more pesticides.<br>
If the dye is incorporated as an aqueous solution, it may be thickened with a suitable thickening agent such as guar gum to fonn a paste so as to allow application by painting or rolling.<br>
II therefore follows that to apply ai2 of the materials as a coating, a plurality of coatings are required. In such circumstances, drying may be carried out to remove excess water between each coating.<br>
Alternatively, all coalings may be sequentially applied and the resultant coated moulded pulp product dried.<br>
Typically the coat weight before drying will be in the range of from 5 to 240 gm'^, preferably 5-50 fim"^. In those instances where all of the materials are applied as a coating, the coat weight is most preferably 30-50 gm"'.<br>
Application of the coatings may Occur using techniques such as rolling, painmg, printing or spraying. Naturally, the materials must be dissolved or dispersed in a liquid that is capable of application, desirably to obtain a uniform coating. If printing is used, well known techniques sucli as offset printing, gravure printing and lithographic printing may he used.<br>
When produced as mosquito coils, the products of the invention may bum typically for Up to 24 hours. By adjusting parameters such as the density, thickress, width and mass of coil, various bum times may be obtained. For example, bum times of at least 4 hours, preferably 7-8 hours may be obtained. It will also be appreciated that the amount of the various additives such as the alkali earth metal nitrate or nitrite, the Sodium silicate, the phosphate and the boron compound will affect bum lime. Brief pescription of the Drawings<br>
Figure 1 is a graph showing the effect of width and thickness On the burn rate of the product with a density of 380± 25 kg/m^<br><br>
Figure 2 is a graph showing the effect of width an bum rate of three different products with a density of 450 ± 50kg/m^,<br>
In order to better understand the nature cf the invention, a number of examples will now be described. Example 1<br>
Trials were conducted to compare the effect on bum rate when the thickness, widtt and density of the strips were altered. Strips were produced of lengths between 4-9mm,<br><br>
with a thickness of 2,3,4and 5mjn at densities cf 300,450 and 600kg/m^ These scrips<br>
were then burnt to delermine their mass hum rate iti g/h-<br>
Figure 1 showstheeffectof varying thickness and widths on bum rate.<br>
The observed trends wore that increasing width increases bum rate, and   increasing<br>
thickness increases bum rate,<br>
figure 2 shows the effect on the bum rate of the product with a density of 4;i0 ±<br>
50kg/m' when an accelerant (KNO3) is added to newspaper pulp and also when using<br>
white office paper instead of old newspaper as ths main ingredient.<br>
Example 2<br>
Trials were conducted to compare the effect on bum rate when white office paper was<br>
used as the main ingredient and also when Ifae accelerant potassium nitrate (KNO]) was<br>
used wiii old newsp^cr. KNO3 was added at a concenlialion of 0.125% in ihe pulp<br>
solution. Figure 2 shows that using wliite office paper as a raw material increase;; tlic<br>
burn rate dramatically. Likewise the addition of KNOs to old newspaper slightly<br>
increases the bum rate compared to old newspaper with no additives.<br><br><br>
