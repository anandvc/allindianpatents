TITLE OF INVENTION A PROCESS FOR PREPARING PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING 4-AMINOQUINQLlNES COMPOUNDS FOR TREATMENT OF INFLAMMATORY DISORDERS OF THE EYE, COMPOSITIONS RESULTING THEREFROM AND METHOD OF TREATING SUCH DISORDERS WITHTHESE COMPOSITIONS.<br>
This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/380926 fliea May 17,2002.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention is a process for preparing pharmaceutical compositions containing 4-aminoqunulines compounds for treatment of ocular inflammation of varied etiology such as immune disease factors, surgery* chemical or mechanical injury, injury due to exposure to radiation, infrared or ultra-violet rays, degenerative changes or dystrophies, allergic or infective etiology, compositions resulting from the said process and treatment of ocular inflammation with the said compositions. The said ocular inflammation may also present as dry eye or ocular surface disorder.<br>
More particularly, this invention relates to ophthalmic pharmaceutical compositions comprising a 4-aminoquinolme compounds, used for the treatment of malaria and rheumatoid arthritis, and methods for treating ocular inflammation with said compositions. This invention relates to a method of administration of 4-aminoquinolines as ophthalmic pharmaceutical compositions that permits administration of 4-amwoquinolmes directly to the eye, through corneal conjunctival, subconjunctival and intravitreal routes for attaining sustained ocular levels of the active agent, without oral or parenteral administratioa Ocular administration avoids the severe side effects of systemicaUy administered 4-<br><br>
aminoquinolones while attaining effective dosage levels in the eye. Chloroquine, a representative generic drug, faas never been used to treat the eye by die composition and method described herein.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Inflammatory disorders of the eye have historically been recognized as complex and vision threatening. Although numerous pharmaceutical agents and compositions exist far its treatment, their site efforts proffle aitf effectiveness are less than desired The side effects may not be acceptable in a particular patient, or if prolonged use is required. The current invention provides a new and original method for treatmeot of CKtflarmtiaiimiatm<br>
Inflammation of the eye may be localized to the eye* the eyes, or may be part of more generalized inflammatory process. Its etiology may be infection, aUergy,mmraiK&gt;logical reactions, or as a respcrase to<br>
other causes. The ocular inflammation causes pain, irritation, watering, threatens visual function of the eye and may also change optical properties of the eye. Inflammation may be seen as uveitis or keratoconjunctivitis. Inflammation may also be seen as *dry eye" or as ocular surface disorder.<br>
Uveitis is an inflammation of the uvea, the middle layer of tissue behind the white of the eye. The cause of uveitis is poorly understood, but a variety of systemic diseases are associated with it. Uveitis has been treated by various classes of compounds including steroids and nonsteroidal amMnflatnmatoty agents such as dexamethasone, ftarometbokme, prednisolone, indomethacin, aspirin, flubiprofen and diclofenac. However, a number of uveitic cases are not responsive to or become refractory to these drugs. Kulkarni, P., 17(2) JOURNAL OF OCULAR PHARMACOLOGY AND THERAPEUTICS 181-7 (2001). Serious side effects including cataract, glaucoma, delayed wound healing, and altered<br><br>
prostaglandin production, Id, at 181, and corneal complications including ulceration, perforation, and corneal and scleral melts have been reported with the use of topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Giridera, AC, Luchs, JI, Udell, IT, 108 OPHTHALMOLOGY 936-944 (2001). Steroids are known to cause increased ocular pressure, cataracts, superinfections, and reduced immunity to infectioa Olsen, EG &amp; Davanger M, 62(6) ACTA OPHTALMOL 893-9 (1984).<br>
A newer immunosuppressive, Tacrolimus, is used orally in uveitis, but may cause severe side effects similar to those seen with cyclosporin including renal dysfunction, and neurological disorders. Kiilkaroi, at 183. The use of Cyclosporin A is further limited by its low penetration into the eye. Van der Bijl, P, van Eyk, AD &amp; Meyer, D 20(5) CCVPROGKAM RLESYMY DOCUMENTOR RAUIPCT I»AFT.DOCORNEA 505-8,505 (2001). Aldose reductase inhibitors have also been used, especially in diabetics. U.S. Patent No. 4,600,717, to York. Fibronectin has also been tried to improve healing, but the defect closure rate was unaltered in the treated group. Phan, TM 30(3) Invest Ophthamol Vis Sci 377-385,381 (1989).<br>
Mast cell stabilizers such as topical Lodoxamide and Cromolyn Sodium have been used to treat vernal keratoconjunctivitis. Avunduk, AM, et al, 107 OPHTHALMOLOGY 1333-1337 (2000). Nedrocromil sodium has a safety profile similar to cromolyn sodium. Verin PJ, Dicker ID, Mortemousque B, 29(4) CuN EXP ALLERGY 529-36 (1999). Vernal keratoconjunctivits is often controlled with topical steroids, but the vision threatening side effects are worse than the underlying disease, which usually is self-limiting and resolves as the patient grows up. Verin, 28(S6) ALLERGY 44 - (1998)<br>
Immunosuppressives such as topical Cyclosporin A have been used in the treatment of Mooren"s ulcer, vernal keratoconjunctivitis, ulcerative keratitis<br><br>
associated with rheumatoid arthrttis, anterior uveitis, and Thygeson"s punctate keratitis. Kulkanri, P., 109 QMBHAIAKHJOGY 845-850 (2002). Recurrence may occur in some patients. Field, AJ, Gottsch, JD, 23(4) Ausr N ZEALAND J OnnHALMOLOGY 333-334 (1995). Cidofovir 1% has been used in acute adenoviral keratoconjunctivits but is limited by local toxicity including conjunctival injection chermosis and punctate epithelial keratitis during the course of treatment and subepithelial infiltrates. It may cause an atypical and uncomfortable erythema of the skin of the eyelids and pronounced conjunctival injection mat could be differentiated from adenoviral conjunctival inflammation alone. Hillenkamp, et al 109 OPOTHALMOLOGY 845-850,847 (2002).<br>
Researchers have studied the use of human epidermal growth factor on postkeratoplasty re-eprthetiahsation without success, in spite of promising earlier animal data no benefit on epithelial healing. DeOaert MJ, et al, 81 BR J QpfflHALMOL 391-395 (1997).<br>
Accordingly, a need exists tor novel ophthalmic pharmaceutical compositions which safely and effectively treat oxailar iinlainmation conditions.<br>
It was disclosed tbat tte 4-aminoquinolines have strong anti-inflammatory<br>
action and are useful for treatment of inflammatory diseases. Rynes, RI, 36 BR J<br>
RHEUMATOL	799-805	(1997).<br>
However, mere has been no report or study in ophthalmologic field. The anti¬inflammatory properties of the anti-malarial 4-amhu&gt;qumolone pharmaceuticals are well known. They have not been used to treat inflammation of the eye because their systemic use in high doses has been associated with a rare, but serious, incidence of ocular toxicity including corneal deposits known as verticiUata, loss of foveal reflex, impairment of accommodatiori, maculopatby and retinopathy. These effects may be reversible or irreversible.<br><br>
Retinopathy is the major and potentially most serious as it is irreversible. Jones, SK, 140(1) BRIT J DERMATOL 3-7, (1999). Ocular toxicity, however, is believed to occur only when doses exceed 6.5 mg/kg/day fix- a minimum of five 5) years. Cordes, MG, 2000 Southern J Optometry, Poster (2000). www.optcom3.com/sio/cordes htmThe dosageof cMoroqurae appears to be the most fundamentally important factor in determining the risk of development of retinopathy. In general, it appears that serious retinopathy m nearly all instances is caused by taking more than 250 mg of cbloroquine diphosphate or 200 mg of cbloroquine sulfate per day to a total amount greater than 100 gms. By not exceeding this daily dosage, it has been found possible for patients to take chloroquine for as long as nine years without developing clinically evident retinopathy. In most cases in which dosage slightly greater than 250 mg cbloroquine diphosphate per day has been administered, the onset of definite retinopathy has taken one to three years. According to Nyiander, most patients who have developed retinopathy have received nearly a total of 300 gms for three or more years. TOXBDOLOOY OF THE EYE, Vol. 1, 272 (Grant, M, ed, 2"* Edition).<br>
This inventor has discovered that when used directly in the eye, the 4-aminoquinolone compounds are non-toxic and highly effective in a wide variety of ocular inflammatory disorders. The 4-arninoquinoline compounds used here in novel ophthalmic pharmaceutical compositions have been previously reported to be useful as therapeutics m the treatment of malaria and riieumatoid artliritis. See, for example, U.S. Pat Nos. 4,421,920 to Baudouin, 5,596,002, to Bfaffaeinz, 5,948,791, also to Hbfheinz.<br>
It has now been found that certaio 4 ammoquiaeteB^ ^4-ammoq^iinoline compounds are useful for preventing and treating ocular inflammation by<br><br>
application of the compositions to the eye prior to, during and after an inflammatory disorder, especially inflammation of the outer and middle coats of the eye, such as dry eye, conjunctivitis, scleritis, keratitis, and uveitis.<br>
The first object of the invention is to provide a novel method by way of "process of composition", route and concentration for the delivery of 4-aminoquinolme drugs directly to the eye for improved effectiveness to treat inflammatory disorders of the eye.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide prolonged stable intraocular levels of 4- aminoquinolkes.<br>
A mrtl^oi^oftbe invention is to provide Biirtamed intraocular levels of 4-^aminoquinolines without having to increase their plasma levels.<br>
Yet another object of the invention is to provide an unproved long term administration method for delivering 4- aminoquinohnes to patients suffering from inflammatory disorders of the eye.<br>
The objects of the invention are met and the problems and shortcomings associated with systemic administration are overcome by the in
Compounds suitable for delivery using this method include ditoroquine, amodiaquine, an isomer or a salt thereof, and structurally similar compounds. As<br><br>
used above, the term "salt thereof is meant to include any nontoxic pharmaceuticaUy suitable salt of a compound described above with the desired pharmacological properties in mammals. Preparation of such a salt is well-known to those skilled in pharmaceutical science.<br>
This inventor has discovered that the 4-aminoquinoHne compounds are no«-toxic to tlw eye when administered directly to the eye. Ocular administration permits the compound to be administered in adequate ocular doses and to maintain intraocular levels of the compound for prolonged periods. The 4-anunoquinolone compounds, when used in ophthalmic pharmaceutical compositions, are effective in treating ocular inflammation of varied etiology such as immune disease actors, surgery, chemical or mechanical injury, injury due to exposure to radiation, infrared or ultraviolet rays, degenerative changes or dystrophies; urticaria, allergic conjunctivitis, vernal conjunctivitis, allergic responses in the eye, iritis, iridocyclitis, sclerals, episcleritis, choroiditis, optic neuritis, Mooren"s ulcer, ulcerative keratitis associated with rheumatoid arthritis, anterior uveitis, Thygeson"s punctate keratitis, or other inimunological reactions; chlamydia, amoeba, adenovirus, cytomegalovirus, toxoplasmosis, tuberculosis, or syphilis; uveitis due to Behcet"s disease, pars planitis, idiopathic uveitis, ocular sarcoid, sympathetic ophthalmia, idiopathic vHritis, vitritis, or uveitis resulting from trauma.<br>
4-armnoquinolines and their derivatives which are particularly suitable for the method of the present invention and processes for preparing these compositions are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,421,920 to Baudouin, U.S. Patent No. 5,596,002, to Hbfheinz, and U.S. Patent No. 5,948,791, to Hbfhemz. To the extent these applications and patents disclose 4-eminoquinoune compounds and their derivatives which are usefiil in the practice of the present invention, they are<br><br>
incorporated herein by reference.<br>
