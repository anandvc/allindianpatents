				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates generally to systems and methods for the exchange of information between instructors and students in an educational context. More specifically, the present invention relates to systems and methods in which an educational instructor interacts with one or more non-collocated students by transmitting course lectures, textbooks, literature, and other course materials, receiving student questions and input, and conducting participatory class discussions using an electronic network such as the Internet and World Wide Web. The present invention also relates to the provision of an infrastructure that allows for on-line registration and tuition payment of educational courses.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
The ability of educators , including educational institutions , private corporations , and institutions of higher learning, to reach potential students has generally been limited by geography. In most instances, a potential student must physically move to within commuting distance or<br>
onto a campus in order to have access to course instructors, classes, and materials.  Furthermore, potential students and persons seeking knowledge of all sorts are generally limited to proximate sources of courses of instruction, tutoring, or training.  Due to these limitations, a prospective student must either seek to learn a given subject from whatever local means of instruction is available to her or move her household in order to be able to access her preferred sources of instruction.  Many prospective students are deprived of receiving instruction from other, possibly better-qualified instructors or institutions located outside of their immediate locale.  Similarly, educational institutions have been limited to serving only those students located within commutable distance of their campuses.<br>
The advent of networked computers and communications has afforded a partial solution to these limitations.  In particular, the widespread use and availability of electronic networks such as the Internet and the World Wide Web have made it possible for students and educators to overcome geographic dispersion and physical location as a barrier to education.  Using this electronic medium, students and instructors are able to exchange information including (live or transcribed) classroom lectures, homework assignments, texts and materials, grading, (live or transcribed) question and answer interaction sessions, and other related information to effect a traditional learning or educational experience regardless of physical location.<br>
However, electronic networks, including the Internet, are complex technological systems requiring the user to have<br>
or acquire specialized knowledge in order to use them effectively.  Even graphical user interfaces (GUIs) designed to enhance simplicity of use, such as that provided by the World Wide Web, may require specialized knowledge of network terminology and technical aspects.  For example, an Internet user's ability to access information using that medium is significantly reduced if the user lacks understanding of how to use Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) to traverse (i.e., navigate) web pages.  Slow adoption of new technology and lack of technological sophistication have a chilling effect on the widespread use of the medium in general.  Applied specifically in an educational context, these chilling factors apply to instructors who, while possessing high expertise in their respective intellectual or educational fields, would be required to further attain technological knowledge necessary to effectively use the Internet to educate non-collocated students.<br>
Furthermore, the complexity of using the Internet for educational purposes is compounded as the number of user choices required at the user interface increases because not only must the instructor and students acquire technological competency in the use of the medium, but they must in addition understand the presentation and consequences of a plethora of choices required by a particular user interface (e.g., a web page).  The design of the user interface therefore can be critical in enabling widespread use of the medium in an educational context.  Solutions other than the present invention may be characterized as. having relatively complicated and confusing user interfaces.  Users, including both students and instructors, of these other solutions are confronted with one or more web pages that typically require<br>
the user to review and select a subsequent web page or function from among a large array of potential user choices, thereby complicating the user's task of interacting with the system.<br>
Further, many educational institutions have existing or legacy network-based systems which students access to obtain various types of information (e.g., class schedules).  The addition of yet another network-based system requires the host or sponsoring institution to incur implementation and maintenance costs associated with the installation, integration, administration, and maintenance of a new network-based system.  These costs place limits on the achieving the widespread use of the medium for educational purposes.<br>
Further, access, presentation, and aggregation of information contained in existing networks are provided from the institution's perspective and not an individual student's perspective.  Typically, a student must access different locations or web pages of an institution's network for each datum she wishes to inspect.  Further, a student may have to log-on to multiple networks in order to access different items of data.  For example, a student may wish to view his financial aid status before registering for an upcoming course or semester.  In existing networks, the student will have to traverse multiple web pages and possibly log-on to multiple networks in order to adcess his current financial aid status, assess that information, and then register online taking into account his particular information.  Many similar situations are commonplace involving access to grading information, class schedule,<br>
exam materials, student group meetings, and other such information.  Existing systems, in short, aggregate course, institution, and student information in an institution-centric manner.  This imposes a time cost upon each student/user of the existing systems in order to reduce complexity from the institution's implementation and maintenance perspectives.  However, given that these time costs are imposed on all students, the sum of these distributed costs outweigh the cost savings realized by the institution in the institution-centric approach, resulting in a net loss.<br>
Further, instructors' teaching techniques are greatly variable, based on personal preference and the subject matter being taught.  Network-based systems that do not provide for a significant degree of customization are ill-suited to address to this need to accommodate diverse teaching modes in a single system.<br>
Further, a general concern with use of the electronic network medium is that response time tends to slow as more users are added to the system.  As response time becomes prohibitive, the time- and cost-effectiveness associated with using the medium for educational purposes is greatly reduced.<br>
Many colleges and universities have stayed away from allowing on-line registration and tuition payment for a  | number of reasons, including high initial setup costs and incompatible billing practices.<br>
The exception to this rule are so-called virtual<br>
schools.  Virtual schools traditionally charge an enrollment fee, and then offer free courses.  In lieu of paying for each course taken, a student is subjected to advertising while viewing on-line course material.  While such billing and income generation methods may be acceptable for companies providing on-line training, such methods are not consistent with traditional college and university billing practices.  Colleges and universities typically charge a low enrollment fee and bill students on a per-credit or per-course basis.<br>
Therefore, it is a general object of the present invention to provide a system and methods that allow users to interact with a computer network-based education support system through means of a simplified, easy-to-use user interface.<br>
A further general object of the present invention is to provide a system that can be easily integrated with existing computer network and backend systems with minimal disruption to existing operations and systems.<br>
A still further general object of the present invention is to provide a system that is scalable in order to accommodate increasing numbers of users, such that system responsiveness is not materially degraded as the number of users of the system grows to an increasingly large number.<br>
A still further general object of the present invention is to provide a system and methods that can accommodate a variety of diverse teaching modes without requiring substantial modifications to the system.<br>
A further object of the invention is to provide such a system that allows multiple types of users to access the features of the system as a function of their predefined role within the framework of the system (e.g. student, teacher, administrator).<br>
It is a further object of the invention to provide such a system that integrates with the education platform provided therein value added services and control such as calendar, task, contact and communication functions.<br>
These as well as other objects of the present invention are apparent upon inspection of this specification, including the drawings and appendices attached hereto.<br>

The user roles comprise a student role associated with a student user, an instructor role associated with an instructor user, and an administrator role associated with an administrator user (roles may be mixed; for example when an instructor of one course  is also a student in another course).  The instructor user is provided with an access level to enable the creation and editing of a plurality of course files associated with a course. The course files include an announcement file, a course information file, a staff information file, a course documents file, an assignments file, a dropbox file, an asynchronous communication file, and a synchronous communication file.<br>
The student user is provided with an access level to enable reading of course files associated with a course. The student user is also provided with an access level to enable modification of some of the files associated with a course. Also, the user may be provided with an access level to enable creation of a student file associated with a file for which the student user is able to read.  The file that the student is able to read may be an assessment file created by the instructor user, and the student file created by the student user is a response to the assessment file. The assessment file may be a plurality of examination questions selected by the instructor user to assess the ability of the student user.  The examination questions may be selected by the instructor user from a predetermined pool of available examination questions.  The examination<br>
questions also may be created by the instructor user substantially at the time of the creation of the assessment file and optionally added to the pool.  The student file may be reviewed by the instructor user and assigned a grade, which would be made available online to the student user. The instructor user may collate the grades obtained from reviewing a number of student files, and the collated grades may be made available online to all student users associated with the course (e.g.: an average for the class, a pie or bar chart, etc.).<br>
The student will also be able to read an assignment file created by the instructor user, and the student file created by the student user is a response to the assignment file.<br>
The "digital dropbox" may contain a plurality of files transferred to the server computer from one or more student users associated with the course.  The instructor user may be provided with access to the files in the dropbox file, whereby the instructor user may download, edit and upload the files in the dropbox.<br>

In this manner, existing legacy systems having large members of user accounts stored in memory may be<br>
integrated with this system without having to re-enter user data into the system (so-called batch enrollment).<br>
In yet another aspect of the invention, provided is a method for providing online education, which includes the steps of establishing a course to be offered online, offering the course to be taken online to a group of student users; and providing access over the network to the course files to a student user who has enrolled in the course.  The establishment of the course includes an instructor user generating a set of course files for use with teaching the course, then transferring the course files_-feo a server computer for storage thereat, and then making access to the course files available to a predefined community of student users having access to the server computer over a network.<br>
Preferably, at least one of the course files comprises a course assignment, and the student user creates a student file in response to the course assignment and transfers the student file to the server computer.  The instructor user accesses the student file from the server computer, reviews the student file to determine compliance with the course assignment, and the instructor user assigns a grade to the student file as a function of the determination of compliance with the course assignment.  The instructor user may post the grade to a file on the server computer accessible only to the student user with which the grade is associated.  The instructor user may repeat these stfeps for a number of student users that are enrolled in the course, and then perform a statistical analysis on the grades assigned to the student users.  The results of the statistical analysis may be made available to the student<br>
users enrolled in the course.<br>
An asynchronous communication tool accessible to student users enrolled in the course may be provided for enabling asynchronous communication amongst the student users.  Likewise, a synchronous communication tool accessible to student users enrolled in the course may be provided for enabling synchronous communication amongst the student users.<br>

More specifically, the present invention can accommodate different billing methods, including, but not limited to, billing on a per-credit-hour basis, and billing on a per-registrant basis.  Tuition may be paid by credit card, debit card, check, or other verifiable payment method.  Payment verification may be performed by the present invention, or the present invention may interface with third-parties providing payment verification services.  In addition, the present invention allows on-line billing information to easily interface with a college, university, or other institution's standard billing practices.  Integrating with existing billing practices simplifies transition to automated systems.<br>
In addition, the present invention may be configured as an open system wherein anyone can connect to a server over the Internet and create a course online that may be taken by anyone else connected over the Internet.  Thus, anyone may<br>
create a virtual classroom available to anyone else, regardless if they are affiliated with a particular institution such as a University. For example, a lawyer may create a course in patent law online, and configure the system to require entry of password to enroll. The lawyer may then disseminate the passwords to desired students who can enroll in the course. Alternately, the lawyer can request the system to require payment to enroll in the course such as by credit card.<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE IMVENTION<br>
Referring to Figure 39, the present invention comprises a system and methods for the exchange of course content and related information between non-collocated instructor users and student users.  An instructor user interacts with one or more non-collocated student users by using the system and methods of the present invention to, without limitation, transmit course files including course lectures, textbooks, literature, and other course materials, receive student questions and input, and conduct participatory class<br>
discussions using an electronic network such as the Internet or World Wide Web.  Access to the course file is controlled by access levels and control logic, to ensure integrity and security of the system.  Also, administrator users have access to the system to perform administrative tasks as defined herein.<br>
System Architecture<br>
The system architecture of a preferred embodiment of an education support system 100 according to the present invention is presented in Figure 1.  Referring now to Figure 1, education support system 100 comprises application subsystems 110, a web browser 120, a web host server 130, a database subsystem 140, and core subsystems 150.  Web host server 130 further comprises a shell service 131. Applications subsystems 110 further comprise a content registry 111, a tool registry 112, a course registry 113, one or more content engines 114, one or more tool engines 115, and one or more course engines 116.  Core subsystems 150 further comprise a core engine 151, an access manager 152, a user interface (i.e., UI) manager 153, a user manager 154, a group manager 155, an event manager 156, a log manager 157, and a connection manager 158.<br>
In a presently preferred embodiment, education support system 100 is implemented in a client-server network topology.  Users (who may have one or several roles such as a student, instructor, teaching assistant (TA), or administrator) access and interact with education support system 100 via web browser 120.  More specifically, a user accesses application subsystems 110 and core subsystems 150 through shell service 131 servlet providing a standard<br>
Internet interface including, but not limited to, TCP/IP, HTTP, SMTP, and FTP to the user via web browser 120 running on a standard computing platform such as a personal computer or workstation.  Specifically, shell service 131 servlet uses the URL-encoded information contained in HTTP requests received from web browser 120 clients to invoke the corresponding requested application subsystem 110 or core subsystem 150.  Shell service 131 servlet also provides user authentication and session management.<br>
Application subsystems 110 function in conformance with an engine/registry model 300 as described in Figure 3. Generally, engine/registry model 300 comprises one or more engines 301, a registry 302, and a context factory 303. Engines 301 include, but are not limited to, content engine(s) 114, tool engine(s) 115, course engine(s) 116, and core engine 151.  Registries 302 include, but are not limited to, content registry 111, tool registry 112, and course registry 113.  Course engine(s) 116 creates a course by associating together a set of educational materials to which a student user has access, by organizing references to these informational items as contained in content registry 111.  Specifically, course engine(s) 116 queries content registry 111 for an index to the content engine 114 associated with a particular resource being requested by a user.<br>
Content engine(s) 111 includes an assessment engine that generates quizzes to assist and instruct users in the use of education support system 100.  For example, one such quiz provided by an assessment engine of education support system 100 provides step-by-step instructions to an<br>
instructor for building a course.  The quiz is then administered online to the instructor to allow him to build a customized course to be provided using education support system 100.<br>
Unlike content engines 111 which represent actual course content, tool engine(s) 115 generally comprise installable programs that provide capabilities available for use with a plurality of courses and not fixedly associated with any particular course or courses.<br>
Instructors have different preferred modes of teaching. Further, the same instructor may emphasize different modes of teaching depending upon the subject being taught.  For example, some instructors emphasize individual homework while others prefer a group or collaborative approach. Education support system 100 supports a variety of teaching methods.  By invoking a particular set of tool engines 115 during interaction with the assessment engine, an instructor can customize a course offering to conform to her preferred mode of teaching.  An example of a tool engine 115 is the chat/whiteboard communication tools (synchronous and/or asynchronous) provided by education support system 100 that allows for student group interaction and collaboration associated with a given course.  Other tools include, but are not limited to, announcements for broadcast of group-oriented messaging, a calendar mechanism for storing date-related events and information, a discussion board for posting questions and answers in a threaded discussion format, notes-editing, group pages, and email services. Further capabilities provided by education support system 100 include, but are not limited to, a catalog listing of<br>
all courses available, means for student users to enroll in either open enrollment or closed enrollment situations, means for course creation including course templates and course themes, a course/page editor and viewer, a site page editor and viewer, means for making and disseminating announcements, a calendar function, a chat board in the nature of an online discussion, a white board allowing group interaction and display of free-form information using, for example, Microsoft Paint™, means for sending email between instructors and students and groups of students, a list of course members and links to their web pages, a list of groups and links to their web pages, a file sharing area, means for providing assignments to student users, means for conducting a variety of types of student assessments (i.e., testing), means for providing lesson material in sequential format, means for adding and removing users, help documents, maintaining a grade book and progress tracking, links to personal web pages or home pages, and a resource library containing references to all uploaded content.  Course templates allow instructors to easily reuse a course structure for subsequent courses.  Course themes allow the instructor to affect the look and feel of the course site.<br>
Further, a presently preferred embodiment of education support system 100 supports a plurality of environments 400 in a single application.  Examples of different environments 400 supported include the personalized web page of student-centric information accessed by a student user and the    | administrator's environment used for maintenance of the system.  Certain parts of the education support system 100 application are consistent across all supported environments 400, while the appearance to the user may vary for different<br>
environments 400.  An environment 400 is defined by console frames that surround the application areas. An example of an environment 400 defined by a four-frame page as shown in Figure 4 comprises a console navbar 401, and console top 402, a toolbar 403, and content 404.  Console navbar 401 and console top 402 are controlled by a console frameset, while toolbar 403 and content 404 are controlled by a separate frameset.  For example, toolbar 403 "buttons" are always located in the top frame of an application area, regardless of the environment 400.  This approach allows users, and especially instructors, the ability to customize their course offerings while conforming to consistent user interface features that allow application areas to be shared across environments 400.  Student users and instructors interact with education support system 100 via the same basic environment 400 format.<br>
Context factory 303 contains information mapping a user to one or more courses associated with that user.<br>
Access control manager 151 creates an access control list (ACL) for one or more subsystems in response to a request from a subsystem to have its resources protected through adherence to an ACL.  Education support system 100 provides multiple levels of access restrictions to enable different types of users to effectively interact with the system {e.g., access web pages, upload or download files, view grade information) while preserving confidentiality of information.<br>
User manager 154 integrates the student-centric nformation with existing network-based systems of an<br>
associated educational institution.  In a presently preferred embodiment, user manager 154 comprises a runtime component and a batch component that periodically access and extract information contained in external institution databases in order to maintain current student-centric information.  User manager 154 facilitates integration of education support system 100 with existing or legacy network-based systems, including proprietary institutional electronic networks and systems related to grades, registration, course schedules, financial aid, etc. without requiring modifications to existing systems or security procedures.<br>
In a presently preferred embodiment, application subsystems 110 and core subsystems 150 interface with database subsystem 140 via the Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) standard interface to allow use of any relational database including, but not limited to, SQL and DB2 Universal Database standards.<br>
Scalability is provided by the modular system architecture described in Figure 1, and, in a preferred embodiment, through use of a load balancing server 200 as shown in Figure 2.  As users are added to the system and access the system as web browser 120 clients, additional web server hosts 130 may be added to the overall system to provide a matching increase in system capacity.  Load balancing server 200 allocates new web browser clients 120 to the least-busy web server host 130 for.servicing.  By thus balancing the load across all web server hosts 130, education support system 100 prevents response times from become unacceptably long for any one given user.  In a<br>
presently preferred embodiment, load balancing server 200 maintains one or more metrics concerning the percent utilization for each web server host 130 and selects the least-busy web server host 130 based upon application of a load balancing algorithm to these utilization metrics.<br>
In a presently preferred embodiment, upon logging onto education support system 100, shell service 131 servlet renders and presents to the user (via web browser 120) a personalized web page comprising a student-centric aggregation of data that may include, without limitation, personal class schedules, grades, a rolled-up or consolidated calendar, links to related tools, student group events for groups of which a particular student is a member, and class announcements.<br>
Education support system 100 executes on a variety of computing platforms including, but not limited to, UNIX'" servers, NT™ servers, Solaris™, HP™, and Linux™.  Education support system 100 supports popular web browsers including, but not limited to, Netscape Navigator™ and Microsoft Internet Explorer™, and, in a preferred embodiment, does not require plug-ins at the web browser client.<br>
In a presently preferred embodiment, an automated upload or import capability is provided in which a user may upload a file to the system and system presents or displays the information contained in the uploaded file in a manner that preserves the grouping of the information, including fields and other categorization, based on the file type. Education support system 100 provides a standard import file format to accomplish this preservation of native grouping of<br>
information.  In a presently most preferred embodiment, the automated upload capability imports an uploaded file in both native and HTML formats, maintaining the file formats associated with the native format for the native formatted file and converting the native format into HTML formats for the HTML formatted file.<br>
Education support system 100 supports a variety of business models.  For example, an institution may charge each student for courses taken via education support system 100; or, an instructor may use education support system 100 to process individual student tuition payments by providing links to e-commerce facilities.<br>
Thus, a system and methods have been shown that that allow users to interact with a computer network-based education support system through means of a simplified, easy-to-use user interface, and that can be easily integrated with existing computer network and backend systems with minimal disruption to existing operations and systems.  The disclosed system and methods is scalable in order to accommodate increasing numbers of users, and can accommodate a variety of diverse teaching modes.<br>
Three Tier Functionality<br>
The present invention will now be described in further detail.  The invention is embodied in four embodiments that represent three levels of functionality of the system that can be provided to and by an institution, and one embodiment that can be offered to anyone on the Internet.  One embodiment embodies a "first tier" functionality and incorporates the basic system, referred to as the Course<br>

the Advanced Course &amp; Portal Manager.  This embodiment incorporates the complete end-to-end "e-Learning" solution. In addition to the Course and Portal Manager, this third tier provides advanced Java-based API's for unifying diverse online campus systems into one integrated platform allowing for user-driven single log-in service delivery, as well as capabilities that allow each school, department or campus within the institution to maintain its own customized environment. Thus, this is the fully functional embodiment that includes all the features and functionality of the first and second tiers and adds certain integration technologies that allow integration of the invention with existing enterprise systems, such as for downloading student databases, etc. as defined further below. This includes a snapshot user management API, an event-driven (real-time) user management API, an end user authentication (security) API, and a network protocol for passing user authentication data.<br>
' It is contemplated that each tier would be offered to institutions in a licensing program that would best suit the needs and budget of the institution.<br>
A fourth embodiment of the invention is operated as a publicly available web site on the Internet, that may be accessed by anyone, whether they are affiliated with an institution or not.  In this embodiment, anyone on the web can create a course, enroll in a public course, etc. as explained further below.  This provides for widespread dissemination of tools and utilities that enable anyone to generate his own course that can be taken by virtually any student.<br>
As further explained herein, the course management tools featured in the present invention allow instructors to monitor, control and customize their course web sites from a web browser interface.  The Course Control Panel provides a robust and easy-to-use interface for such course management. The system allows instructors to customize the names of course web site navigation buttons to suit their needs and requirements.  The system also allows the instructor to add or drop individuals or groups of students from a course as required.  The system features extended student enrollment option, such as a limited-time self-enrollment (e.g. certain dates only for the self-enroll feature), password-protected enrollment, and defined course duration (e.g. for self-paced study).  Courses may be recycled between academic terms by automatically resetting discussion boards, assessment, and other content areas.  In addition, the instructor can track student progress, grades and content usage through the system.<br>
As further explained herein, the content management tools featured in the present invention allow instructors to post course documents, staff information, assignments, etc. Text may be typed directly into a form, or existing files may be accessed and uploaded automatically.  Documents such as word processing files, spreadsheets, slide presentations, graphics, audio and video clips, etc. may be uploaded in this manner.  Streaming multimedia may provided interactivity between the student and the course.  Pop-up maps provide easy course site navigation, thus enriching the teaching and learning environments.<br>
The communication and collaboration tools enhance the<br>
interaction between the students and instructors with asynchronous discussion boards as well as synchronous chat tools.  Online discussions may be managed wherein messages are sortable by date, author, title, etc., and may be archived and printed.  A digital dropbox is a file sharing utility that allows sharing of documents between users. Virtual office hours may be held, and even field trips conducted online with these tools.<br>
The assessment tools in the present invention increase student preparedness, measure student progress, and customize lessons by creating and administering quizzes and surveys.  Provided is an easy to use, step by step process to create the quizzes and surveys, wherein the instructor may mix and match multiple question types such as multiple choice, multiple correct, true/false, matching, ordering, fill in the blank, and essays.  Multimedia or other attachments may easily be included with the assessment questions.  Questions may be randomized and re-used from assessment pools.  Tests provided to students may be password protected and timed, and may provide instant feedback to students.  Advantageously, statistical reports may be created from the assessments and student answers.<br>
The personal information management tools in the present invention allow students, instructors, administrators and all other users to access basic course, personal, and institutional data through a user-centric "My Institution" screen.  The user may view announcements from multiple courses in one central location, and maintain personal calendar, address book, user directory and to-do lists.<br>
The present invention also provides for access to a plethora of academic resources that supplement the student's online education experience.  The user may browse discipline-specific information, resources and communities linked to each course website.  These academic resources may be customized and personalized to fit the users' needs.<br>
The system management tools available with the present invention allow system administrators to monitor, control and customize an institution's online teaching and learning environment from the web browser.  The system administrator may control security permissions and enable/disable features for numerous user roles.  Batch user enrollment (and unenrollment) may be performed system wide.  Preferences and options may be managed on multiple courses, all from within a central system administrator panel.  The system administrator may also track and report faculty, student and course statistics, may plan and manage system hardware requirements by assigning instructors with pre-assigned disk quotas for content storage, and may employ system-wide announcements to broadcast messages to users about system maintenance or institutional announcements.<br>
In the Course &amp; Portal Manager embodiment, the enterprise database support provides support for tens of thousands of users across an entire institution or system of institutions.  User and course data may be managed efficiently and effectively.  Moreover, large volumes of transactions may be managed efficiently and effectively. The "My Institution" interface includes portal and community functionality along with quick access to web email, course<br>
and institutional announcements, and links to other campus departments.  Administrators may enable or disable portal modules and establish required and optional modules from the portal options menu bar.  Administrators may also assign different portal default settings to different user roles (e.g. students get different portals than instructors).<br>
Course e-commerce management functionality allows institutions to set prices and charge fees for course enrollment directly through the "e-Learning" platform.<br>
In the Advanced Course &amp; Portal Manager embodiment, the snapshot user management tool allows scheduling of one-time or periodic (i.e. hourly, daily, weekly) data integration from existing student information systems, automating course population and keeping the we-Learning" environment synchronized with administrative and student data. Moreover, the end-user authentication enables a single login environment for the institution portal for all students, instructors, administrators and staff, which streamlines all campus services into a single web portal environment.<br>
The present invention will now be described in further detail and embodiments.  Figure 5 shows a screen shot of the home page 500 that a user will view, which is customizable in accordance with the requirements and desires of any user. The home page may also be institutionally branded, so that the "Your Institution" logo 504 shown in Figure 5 would display the name of the institution that has licensed the product (i.e. "New York University").  The home page also provides the user with direct access to personal, course, and institutional tools.  As an added feature, the system enables each user to select from a large number of news and<br>
information services, so that everyone who uses the system will have access to the most recent and relevant information for them.  All of this functionality is provided in one place - the home page - so that the institution can provide a sense of community on campus, with courses, and with a view to the external information sources.<br>
By selecting the "Courses" tab 502 shown in Figure 5, the user will be linked to a Course page 600 as shown in Figure 6, which provides direct links to the courses that they teach (602, 604) and/or are enrolled in (606, 608, 610).  To access the course website, the user will click on the course title (and 602, 604, 606, 608 or 610), he is automatically linked to a web page associated with that course.  The user also has the opportunity to browse the course catalog 612 by selecting the links on the right side of the page 600, where courses are listed according to category.  The user may also search through the course search engine by selecting the Browse Course Catalog Link 614.<br>
For example, by selecting the link 602 for the Introduction to Music course, which the user in this example is teaching, the user is shown the web page 700 illustrated in Figure 7.  The default view for the course web site 700 in this embodiment is the Announcements page 702, as shown in Figures 7 and 8.  As seen at the lower part of the screen in Figure 8, the user has the option of selecting various types of views by filtering out certain time-based announcements (i.e. today, last 2 weeks, last month, or all) by selecting button 802.  The Announcements section can also be linked to after the user has left that page (i.e. is<br>
viewing another part of the course web site) by simply clicking the Announcements button 804 on the navigation toolbar 806 on the left of the web page.<br>
Within the course website environment, the user is able to access all of the relevant course material and communication features as shown herein.  The entire course outline may be displayed in a separate browser window 900, wherein the course contents are available for perusal and hyperlinking as desired.  Figure 8 shows the entire web page for Introduction to Music in two parts (an upper part and a lower part, which of course is scrollable as desired).  As can be seen, one of the function buttons provided is labeled "Course Map" 808, which upon being clicked will popup the Course Contents window 900 shown in Figure 9 (in an expanded browser window).  As can be seen, the user will be able to expand or collapse the various headings provided in order to drill into the entire course contents as currently configured.  So, for example, the user can expand the Assignments section 902 and get a linkable list of all the assignments that have been created for the course to date. Any of the assignments may then be clicked for easy access thereto.  This separate window 900 is especially advantageous since it allows users to browse the entire course, regardless of their current location in the web site.<br>
Thus, by selecting any of the Assignments links |902, the user would be linked to the web page 1000 set forth in Figure 10.  This web page lists each assignment that has been compiled for the course, each of which can be linked to web pages that contain the full details of the particular<br>
assignment.  The assignment page 1000 shown in Figure 10 may of course also be viewed by clicking the "Assignments" button 804 on the toolbar at the left of the course home page shown in Figure 8.  In general, any of the functions that are provided by toolbar buttons on the navigation bar at the left of the course home page will be available in any page accessed for that site, so that easy navigation may be had and the user may jump around and visit any desired portion of the course web site no matter where the user is currently located.  Likewise, the Course Contents window provides similar functionality as described above.<br>
As shown in Figure 10, folders that have quizzes and surveys may be linked to by viewing the assignments web page.  Clicking on these folders will present the student and/or instructor with a quiz that may be taken online, wherein the answers may be graded automatically, in realtime, as soon as the student has finished the quiz.  This assessment functionality will be explained in greater detail below.<br>
In general, assignments may be provided in virtually any type of media that he instructor has at his disposal. For example, shown in Figure 10 is a link 1002 to a multimedia presentation for "Physics in Music", which will give the student a content-enriched lesson that will be useful, prior to the next lesson.  Assignments may also be as simple as a text based file that the student would read in preparation for the required class session.<br>
In addition to selecting the Assignments page 1000 or the Announcements page 700, the user may select the Course<br>
Information button 1004 on the toolbar.  This will link the user to a web page that will list information provided by the instructor that is useful to the student, such as an introductory welcome message, links to helpful resources, etc.  Resources otherwise found on other parts of the course web site may also be shown here if desired by the course web site developer.  Links may be in the form of URLs to other web pages or resources, or to folders that include groups of logically related resources.<br>
Selection of the Staff Information navigation button 1006 will provide the user with a web page that will list each instructor, TA, professor, etc., along with an abstract listing office hours, address, telephone number, etc. on each, as well as a link that be clicked to send an email. This gives the student with quick, easy access to any instructor as may be desired throughout the course.  Images and other types of multimedia files may also be made available at this page for enhanced content viewing.<br>
The user may select the "Course Documents" link 1008 shown in the navigational toolbar, after which the web page 1100 on Figure 11 is provided for that course.  This provides the user with immediate access to all documents relevant to the course.  As a student, the user has access to all of the course materials, including additional links to information on the web that will enhance the instructional experience.  As an instructor, the user has the ability to post documents of numerous file formats and from disparate locations.<br>
By selecting the "Communication" tab 1010 shown in<br>
Figure 10, the student is provided with the Communication Center web page 1200 as shown in Figure 12.  In this area, the user has at his disposal many different ways of establishing communications with other users of the system as well as accessing other areas of the system for various types of information.  Thus, the user has access to an email utility 1202, a student roster list 1204, a list of student homepages 1205, a discussion board 1208, a virtual classroom chat 1210, and a group pages link 1212.<br>
Selection of the Send E-Mail link 1202 loads a web page with various links that allow the user to send email to individuals registered for the course, to students only, to instructors only, etc.  The email function is accomplished via web-based email and allows for users to send attachments, etc. as in many existing email packages available today.  Selection of the Student Roster link 1204 displays a web page that lists all of the students registered for the course, along with contact information if allowed by the student (such as phone number, address, email address, etc.).  Selection of the Student Pages link 1206 provides a web page with links to the homepage for each student in the class.<br>
Another very effective communication tool is the asynchronous Discussion Board 1300, as shown in Figure 13, which is displayed by the student selecting the Discussion Board link 1208 of Figure 12.  Here, students can access this for threaded discussions that are archived for easy retrieval.  By using the discussion board, students can help each other learn even more easily outside of regular class hours.  It can also be used as an effective method for<br>
instructors and TAs to use as a tutorial tool for out-of-class questions and discussions that need to be saved for the purpose of sharing with the rest of that class. This utility operates in accordance with techniques well known in<br>
the art.<br>
By clicking on the Virtual Chat link 1210, the student is provided with a web page 3300 as shown in Figure 33, labeled "virtual chat".  That is, each course has its unique chat area built into the course site.  Students can engage in chats about the course, collaborate on assignments, and share information beyond the boundaries of the classroom or posted materials.  The instructor can monitor the chats or actively engage in discussions.  This real-time virtual chat feature can also accommodate a whiteboard mode.<br>
Selection of the Group Pages link 1212 displays a web page that lists various groups of users that are grouped by special interests (such as music lovers, bookworms, sports fans, etc.). Access to these groups is a definable parameter that is set by the system administrator.<br>
Selection of the External Links button 1012 will display a web page that is provided with URLs for relevant content that the instructor deems may be useful to the student community.  For example, in a law course, links may be provided to various legal research web sites, a Congressional web page, etc.<br>
Selection of the Student Tools button 1014 will display a web page 1400 of associated links as shown in Figure 14. These links include various tools needed by the student,<br>

By clicking the Student Drop Box link 1402, the student is provided with a web page that will allow control and access to the student's digital dropbox, which is a folder of files that the student can exchange with the course instructor.  As shown in Figure 15, the dropbox web page 1500 allows the student to type in box 1502 the resource location of a file that he wishes to provide to the instructor, or to browse his computer's hard drive with button 1504, network drive, etc. in accordance with well known techniques to locate the file and insert the appropriate pointer.  Clicking the Send File button 1506 will finish the task of uploading the file.  A list 1508 of uploaded files that exist in the student's dropbox is also set forth in this page, along with a control link 1510 that enables the removal of a file.  By using this utility, the student can submit documents such as term papers to the instructor, who can then read and post comments to the file for return to the student and review.<br>
Selection of the Change Your Information link 1404 provides the student with a web page that sets forth his personal data, such as name, address, email, phone number, password, etc.  In addition, certain system preferences may be set at this location.  Similar to this link is the Edit Your Homepage link 1408, which will allow the student to access his homepage and make modifications as he desires (e.g. change a JPEG picture on the page, change hotlink list, etc.)<br>
Selection of the Check Your Grades link 1406 will deliver a web page that shows the grades that the student has been assessed in the course, such as for exams, quizzes, term papers, projects, assignments, etc.  The student may be able to link to the specific exam or paper through this utility in order to review the exam again, which may be useful for example in preparing for a final exam.  The instructor may also provide to the student a statistical review of the entire class so that the student has a better feel for the grade he may receive (for example, the class median, mean, curve data, etc.) .<br>
The Student Calendar button 1410 will provide well<br>
known PIM (personal information management) functionality to<br>
the student.  The Calendar web page can display calendar<br>
events in a graphical display for that course, all the<br>
student's courses, all institution events, as well as<br>
personal calendar events programmed by the user.  Thus,<br>
different entities can program calendar events, which can be<br>
selectively displayed by the student by selection of display<br>
functions on the page.  For example, the instructor can<br>
program the calendar events for the course, and an<br>
administrator can program calendar events for the entire<br>
campus, and these will be displayed on the student's<br>
calendar since he is registered for the course.  This<br>
provides the student with a greater ability to manage his<br>
calendar than has been available in the past. The final button on the Student Tools web page is the Student Manual link 1412, which when selected provides the student with access to an online manual that may be used for<br>
a "help" reference in navigating the web site.<br>
Located below the navigation button toolbar is a group of control buttons 1420.

An Add File button 2006 and an Add Folder 2008 button is also provided, which displays a web page with various fields that the instructor will fill in to define the new entjry.  In addition, the instructor is able to select the Add From Institution button 2010 to select a new reference that is available from a pool of references made available to all instructors from the institution.  The new entry may be<br>
uploaded directly to the server for later access by the instructors associated with the course. After submitting the new entry to the server, the new Instructor Library page is posted to all instructors associated with the course.<br>
The Virtual Classroom link 1636 displays a web page that provides a link to either launch a virtual classroom (and thus participate in real-time, synchronous classroom sessions), or to view the classroom archives (view previous classroom sessions and/or download these sessions to the instructor's computer).  Each course includes a Virtual Classroom, which is a synchronous chat room for student and group communications. The Virtual Classroom can be used to hold "live" classroom discussions, TA sessions, and office hour type question/answer forums.   One can even have guest speakers and subject matter experts talk with the class in the Virtual Classroom.<br>
A Virtual Classroom contains several distinct areas. The Whiteboard Space is where web pages are displayed, which is the large center area. One can also write or draw on this space using the drawing toolbar.  The Menu Bar is used to change the information that appears on the whiteboard space, such as selecting a font to use on the whiteboard space and moving an object on the whiteboard space behind another object. One can also prepare lessons, navigate slides displayed on the whiteboard space, and clear the Group Discussion tab and Questions and Answers tab (refer to the Tab Panel description for further information on these tabs). The Application Tool Bar contains tools for navigating web pages. The Location Field is used to enter the URL of a web page the user would like to use during the<br>
Virtual Classroom session. The web page is then displayed on the whiteboard space. Users can also write or draw on the web page with the drawing toolbar.  The Drawing Toolbar is used to write and draw on the whiteboard space.  The Status Region is where status messages are displayed at the bottom of the Virtual Classroom window.  The Tab Panel is used to chat with students, respond to students' questions, control classroom behavior, and view information about the students in the Virtual Classroom.<br>
The following panels are available:<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Selection of the Discussion Board link 1638 displays a web page that provides links to the available discussion boards that are associated with the course.  A discussion board is another communication tool to use in a classroom setting. This feature is similar to Virtual Chat, but is designed for asynchronous use, so users do not have to be available at the same time to have a conversation.  An additional advantage of the discussion board is that user conversations are logged and organized. Conversations are grouped into forums that contain threads and all related replies.<br>
Selection of the Digital Dropbox link 1640 displays a web page 2100 as shown in Figure 21 that lists the files that exist in the digital dropbox.  The Digital Dropbox is a tool that the instructor and students can use to exchange files. The Dropbox works by "uploading" a file from a disk or a computer to a central location. A participant can then come and "download" it to work locally.  The Digital Dropbox is used to exchange materials between a single student and the instructor. Information that needs to be posted for all students should be placed in the Course Documents area using the Page Editors.<br>
Individual student access to the Dropbox is available from the File Transfer Area located in Student Tools area on the Course. Students also have group access to a private dropbox from a group homepage.<br>
The web page 2100 displayed lists the current files in the dropbox, which are the files that participants have sent to the user. Files posted here can be accessed and saved. The Send File 2102 to the Student area is where files are uploaded and sent to specific students.  The user can also delete files that are no longer needed.<br>

Selection of the Manage Groups link 1658 enables the instructor to create and edit certain user groups (e.g. gifted students, remedial students, etc.).<br>
Assessment<br>
Within the course, instructors are able to bring quizzes, tests, and surveys online.  Included may be essay, true/false, multiple choice, fill-in-the-blank, or matching questions.  The questions can include text, graphics or multimedia.  For the student, iAstant feedback is provided through automatic grading functionality.  For the instructor, there is the ability to randomize the tests, time them, and create statistical reports of outcomes. Assessments within this system are an optimal way to<br><br>
increase student preparedness for class and to track and compare student progress over time.  The Assessment area 1612 of the control panel 1602 allows the instructor to select an Assessment Manager link 1660, a Pool Manager link 1662, an Online Gradebook link 1664, or a Course Statistics link 1666.<br>
Selection of the Assessment Manager link 1660 in the assessment area 1612 displays a web page that enables the instructor to create, edit and otherwise manage the assessment content areas.  For example, the instructor may create an assessment by entering an assessment name, a description, and setting certain parameters including Show Detailed Results (shows the students the results for each question instead of simply their final grade), Reveal Correct Answer (shows the students the correct answer for each question) , Feedback Enabled (allows students to view the feedback that the instructor has entered for each question) , Allow Multiple Attempts (allows students to take the assessment more than once), Set Time for Quiz (sets a timer that is shown to the student during the exam), and Password Protect (allows only those students with the entered password to take the test). By clicking the Modify option, a web page is displayed that enables the instructor to modify the assessment by adding items.  An item is added by selecting the type of question (multiple choice, true/false, fill in the blank, etc.), typing in the question text and possible answers (i.e. if ijt is multiple choice) with an indication of the correct one, specify the order of answers, etc.  The order of the questions can be changed in this web page as well.<br>
Selection of the Pool Manager link 1662 in the assessment area 1612 displays a web page that enables the instructor to Add Pool, Import Pool, Search Pool, or Export Pool.  Pools are predefined groups of questions and answer sets that are logically linked, usually by subject matter, so that an instructor may draw from a pool to obtain existing questions and answers sets from other courses, instructors, semesters, etc. and not have to "recreate the wheel" every time they generate or modify a test.  Thus, by clicking the Add Pool button, the instructor can add a new pool to the list of pools displayed on the Pool Manager web page.  He will have to type in the name of the new pool and a description of it on this form.  By clicking the Import Pool button, the instructor will enter the name of an existing pool to import, or alternatively browse a disk drive to find the pool to import.  By clicking the Search Pool button, the instructor is presented with a web page that will enumerate various available pools that can be searched for questions of interest for importing.  The entire pool can be previewed by selecting a preview mode, and all of the available questions in that pool may be viewed.  By clicking the Export Pool button, a pool may be selected for exporting purposes.  For the list of available pools set forth on the Pool manager page, the instructor may modify the pool, in which case a web page is displayed that lists all of the questions (and associated answer sets) that are in the pool.  Each question in the pool may be modified in the same manner as explained above w^-th respect to the assessment manager.  Likewise, questions may be deleted entirely from a pool, and new questions may be added to the pool as described above with respect to the assessment manager.<br>
Selection of the Online Gradebook link 1664 in the assessment area displays a web page that enables the instructor to perform various functions with respect to the online course gradebook.  Figure 22 illustrates a web page 2200 entitled "Course Gradebook", which provides a variety of information including consolidated grades, individual assignment/test scores, direct access to specific assignments or tests by student, or a look at a specific test with aggregated results.  This allows the instructor to organize the grade information so that it is meaningful.  It provides insight into the effectiveness of certain assignments and provides a bridge for allowing instructor-assessment of assignment and class content.  The functions provided on the Online Gradebook web page in the assessment area of the control panel include Report By User (used to find a specific user and view statistics, assessment results, and modification of any scores for a user), Report By Item (used to view information about a specific gradebook item), Spreadsheet View (standard gradebook view as shown in Figure 22, the instructor can modify, add or remove gradebook entries as well as view assessment results), and Export Gradebook (exported as a comma-delimited file).<br>
Selection of the Course Statistics link 1666 in the assessment area displays a web page that enables the instructor to set parameters and view certain statistics for their course.  Most instructors want) to analyze their class by how much their online materials are being accessed, but very few have the opportunity to take the time or the effort to determine these numbers.  By using the course statistics web page 2300 shown in Figures 23A and 23B, the system<br>
provides a rich tool set for instructors to evaluate the relative statistics of their courses.  These statistics may be valuable for evaluating online versus non-online courses to determine the relative efficacy of online materials and how they are enhancing the course.  Thus, the Course Statistics web page has input fields for selecting a report filter, which will yield a report with Overall Summary of Course Usage, Main Content Areas report, Communication Areas Report, Group Areas Report, or Student Areas Report.  The time period must be specified, which may be all dates or between a beginning date and an end date.  The users must be selected, which will be either all users or a selected subset thereof.  Other options include Total Number of Access per Area 2302, Number of Accesses over Time 2304, User Accesses per Hour of Day 2306 (or Day of Week 2308) , and Total Accesses by User 2310.  The data, charts and graphs as shown in Figures 23A and 23B will then be displayed to the instructor.<br>
Assistance<br>
Finally,: there is an Assistance area 1614 defined in the Control Panel, which sets forth links that will provide the instructor with various types of help.  Selecting the Online Manual' link 1668 will bring up an HTML based Instructor Manual in a separate browser window.  The Online Support link 1670 will bring up a web page with contact info for sending an email to a support person, and the Contact Admin link 1672 will bring up a web page with contact info for sending an email to an administrative contact.<br>

Other Utilities and Functions<br>
One of the key elements to college and university life is the ability to socialize and take advantage of the human element on campus.  The system's "Community" tab 2502 provides the web page 2500 shown in Figure 25, which allows students to interact and be involved in all aspects of campus life from fraternities and sororities to off-campus communities that enhance the learning experience.  Many campuses also provide rich services such as job availability through the community function.  The Community center is the web equivalent of the student union building.<br>
Most students are so conversant in online services that they prefer to have campus administrative services available all the time on the web.  The system provides an enterprise level teaching and learning system that allows tight integration into student information systems and other campus systems to provide anytime, anywhere administrative services.  The Services web page 2600 shown in Figure 26 (selected by tab 2602) enables users to register, add, drop, check records, or even pay parking tickets while online at anytime.<br>
The system also provides a calendar 2700 that incorporates personal as well as institutional information in a single view, as shown in Figure 27.  The calendar<br>
utility gives students and teachers access to all calendar events for each of the courses they are enrolled in, as well as institutional calendar events.<br>
Since email is the single most popular application on the Internet today, and the leading reason that most people purchase personal computers, email has been integrated with the system, as shown by the web page 2800 in Figure 28. Within a personalized home page, the user will be able to access complete email capabilities.  The email system sits on top of the existing POP or IMAP server and offers a web-based front end so that the user may access messages from any machine at any time.<br>
Figures 31 and 32 show web pages 3100 and 3200 that can be accessed by tab 3102 to provide links that allow students and teachers to find and access academic resources and content.  These resources are also context-sensitive to the course discipline.  For example, if one accesses the academic web resources from an accounting course, he is automatically directed to news and information sources that are relevant to accounting.  The user has access to news, web links, reference works, and search engines that enhance the ability to locate relevant information quickly.<br>
In another aspect of the invention, provided is a system and method for applying E-commerce to education. Specifically, this aspect of the invention allows users visiting a web site to register and pay for courses provided by a college, university, or other institution.<br>
Figure 34 is a block diagram illustrating information<br>
passed from a course registration server to a payment server.  As a current or prospective student reviews courses offered by a college, university, or other institution, a student may add courses of interest to a list, or "shopping cart".<br>
When a student has selected courses for which they would like to register, a student may proceed from a registration or review area (Block 100) to a "checkout" area (Block 110), as illustrated in Figure 34.  When a student proceeds to a checkout, information, such as, but not limited to, name, address, cost of courses, order identifier, order description, and a page to which a user is to be returned when an order is complete, is passed on. Information passed from a registration or review area may be used to generate a payment form.<br>
Figure 35 is a sample of a payment form.  A payment form may consist of an introductory paragraph 210, a purchase summary 220, a payment information area 230, and the like.  An introductory paragraph 210 may be used to instruct a student in requirements at each stage of the payment process.  A purchase summary 220 may include services and products selected, per-unit prices, quantities requested, inventory numbers for each product or service selected, an invoice or purchase number, a total price, and other, similar information.<br>
A payment information area 230 can be used to collect payment information from a student.  A student may be required to enter some information manually, such as, but not limited to, credit card type, credit card number, credit<br>
card expiration date, name on credit card, credit card billing address, check number, checking account number, bank routing number, debit card number, and personal identification number ("PIN code").<br>
If a student has previously used the present invention, some information may be automatically entered based on previously submitted forms.  Information transferred from a registration server may also be used to fill in some form fields.  When a student has reviewed entered information, a form may be submitted for processing by activating a button or other interface element.<br>
Figure 36 is a block diagram illustrating interaction between a payment server and a payment validation server. After a student has entered necessary information into a payment form and submitted the form (Block 300), some information, such as, but not limited to, amount of purchase, credit card number, name on credit card, check number, bank routing number, or billing address, may be transmitted to a payment validation server (Block 310).  A payment validation server may be maintained as part of the present invention, or payment validation servers may be maintained by one or more third parties, such as, but not limited to, CyberCash, Inc.<br>
A payment validation server processes transmitted information, contacts a bank or other institution issuing the credit card or other payment form, and verifies that a payment of the amount requested is authorized.  If payment of the requested amount is authorized, authorization information, including, but not limited to, a confirmation<br>
number, may be transmitted to a payment server. If payment of the specified amount is not authorized, other information, such as a declination code, may be transmitted to a payment server.  If payment is not authorized, a payment error message similar to Block 320 may be displayed. Figure 37 is a sample of a payment information page. A student may print or otherwise record information displayed on a payment information page for his or her records. A payment information page can include a thank you, confirmation, or other message (Block 410).  A payment information page may also include information such as, but not limited to, confirmation or declination information; goods, services, and classes purchased; and total price charged (Block 420).  In addition, a payment information page may include a button or other interface element which a user can activate to continue processing.  The exact behavior of this interface element may be determined by the referring system through the URL or other data element which is illustrated in Figure 34.<br>
Figure 38 is a block diagram illustrating post-order processing.  As previously stated, a payment information page may also contain a button or other interface element which, when activated, causes a web page to be displayed or performs other processing steps.  Activating the button or interface element may also cause some authorization/ declination information to be transferred to a college, university, or other institution's accounting department for processing (Block 530).<br>
