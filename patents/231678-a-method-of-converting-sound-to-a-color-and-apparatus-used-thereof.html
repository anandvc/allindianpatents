				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a method and an apparatus for selecting a harmonic color using the harmonics, and a method and an apparatus for converting sound to color or color to sound, and more particularly to a method and an apparatus capable of converting a sound into a color image or an image into a sound, by selecting the harmonic color exactly tuned with an optional reference color based on the harmonics, and frequency conversion of a sound or a color having a characteristic of wave.<br>
Description of the Related Art<br>
According to the popularization of color due to the color television broadcasting, the economical value of the color is increased. Also, due to the indiscriminate supply of the color by the commerce of the color, the discordant color provides a human life with new color pollution.<br>
Accordingly, it is very important for web designers, artists,   architects,   interior   decorators,   industrial<br>
de igners, landscape architects, dress designers, stage directors, creators of various fields, and purchasers to select the harmonic color.<br>
The term 'color harmony' means two or more colors are used in close to each other to give a good effect.<br>
According to the conventional color harmony, the harmony color is selected by reference to a book printed in a color of which an optional reference color is printed and the harmony colors harmonizing with the reference color are printed as a natural color based on visual experience of human. The standard of representative color harmony is a Coloring Book, a Munsell Colorimetric System, and CIS Standard Colorimetric system.<br>
However, the conventional lacks of objectivity in that the method is based on the human experience or the experiment. Because the harmony color is selected by the visible sense by reference to the printed reference material, the accuracy of the color may be reduced. In addition, it is impossible to use the printed reference for a Desk Top Publishing system using a computer.<br>
In a converting method sound to color deriving the harmony color from the harmony music, the color and the sound are different to the band of frequency adapted to the sense of sight and hearing, but are identical to the property of physical wave.  However, it has not been studied<br>
or: the reversible conversion of the color and the sound.<br>
The conventional sound pressure displaying apparatus which is representative of a graphic equalizer visualizing the change of the sound displays only magnitude of the sound pressure each a band of frequency, thereby providing a disadvantage of simply displaying the image and limiting the application range.<br>
US Patent No. 6,046,724 issued to Havass discloses a method and an apparatus for the conversion of sound waves to light. According to the Havass patent, the light matching a sound is displayed by controlling three color light sources of RGB based on each frequency and the magnitude of the sound through 6 filter means corresponding from 3 octave to 8 octave.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
Hereinafter, the present invention will be described with respect to the preferred embodiment illustrated in the annexed drawings.<br>
FIG. 1 is a table of converting sound to color, of which is a circle coordinate according to the present invention. FIG 1 illustrates one example in that each of 12 musical scales of harmonics is represented to a color, for example,  'do'  tone  (indicated by  'C'  in FIG.  1)  being<br>
corresponding to red (682 nm) .  As will be seen from FIG. 1, the  color  is  arranged  in  such  a  way  that  a  value logarithmically taken by a visible frequency from a low frequency is in direct proportion to an angle by reference to the position, on which 'do' tone is positioned, as zero. The color is represented in order of red, orange, yellow, green, blue and purple.   The number of musical scale (in order words, it is nuiiaber in that a band of frequency of an octave is logarithmically divided) are arranged based on 12 musical scales represented by do (C) , do# (C#), re (D), re# (Eb) , me (E), fa (F), fa# (F#), sol (G) , sol# (Ab) , la (A), la# (Bb) and Ci (B) .  The luminance of color system and the octave of musical scale are arranged in 1 : 1 corresponding relationship.   Accordingly,  the luminance and the octave rise toward the center of circle, and lower from the center of circle.<br>
Fig. 2 shows the first sound/color converting table of an orthogonal coordinate system according to the presen: invention. A horizontal axis of the first sound/color converting table indicates a sound tone and a color, while a vertical axis thereof indicates an octave and a luminance. In the first sound/color converting table a saturation of the color is changed in. direct proportion to the sound tone. Accordingly, in the same octave, the luminance of colors is different, while the saturation is identical.<br>
Fig. 3 shows the second sound/color converting table of an orthogonal coordinate system according to the present invention. A horizontal axis of the second sound/color converting table indicates a sound tone and a color, while a vertical axis thereof indicates an octave and a luminance. In the second sound/color converting table the luminance of the color is changed in direct proportion to the sound tone. Accordingly, in a horizontal direction, the luminance of colors is identical, while the saturation is different.<br>
FIGs. 4 and 5 show musical instruments of which the position of the musical scale is colored based on the sound/color converting table according to the present; invention. FIG. 4 shows a case where the position of the scale of a guitar and a piano is colored based on the second sound/color converting table that the sound tone is in proportion to the luminance. FIG. 5 shows a case where the musical instruments are colored based on the first sound/color converting table.<br>
According to the musical instruments adopted the principle of the present invention, a player can recognize the musical scale position using the color, thereby distinguishing the octave of the musical scale and the sound tone.<br>
FIG. 6 is a block diagram of a harmony color selection apparatus according to the present invention, the apparatus<br>
comprising selection means 10, storage means 12, operation means 14, and display means 16.<br>
The selection means 10 selects a reference color for searching for a harmony color, and selects a scale dividing rate and a harmonics code.<br>
The storage means 12 stores the first and the second table of FIGs. 7 and 8. FIG. 7 shows the first table illustrating the musical scale dividing rate and a harmony frequency ratio, and FIG. ' 8 shows the second table illustrating the harmony frequency ratio corresponding to the harmonics code.<br>
If the scale dividing rate is selected as an average ratio, the operation means 14 operates the harmony color as following:<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
wherein, Fh denotes a harmony frequency to be obtained, Fc denotes an input frequency, k denotes the number of musical scale which is resulted from dividing a frequency of one octave by a constant rate, n denotes a harmony frequency ratio and 1 ≤ n ≤ (k-1), in which k and n are natural number.<br>
Generally, since 12 musical scales is used, it will now be explained a case in that k is 12, and n is from 1 to 11. In the above equation, since k is 12, is about 1. 3594,  and is a ratio of adjacent frequencies when the<br>
frequency of one octave is divided by a log ratio of constant interval.  Specifically, in the tone, when a tone of one octave is divided by 12 scales, the frequency ratio is identical with that of adjacent tone (for example,  Mo' and Mo#' ) .<br>
Thus, the harmony frequency ratio n means a constant ratio of interval consisting of a particular code, for example, in a major code consisting of Mo, mi' sol' , since a constant ratio interval of frequencies corresponding to xmi' tone and Mol' tone is 4 and 7, respectively, by reference to the frequency corresponding to Mo' tone, the value of harmony frequency ratio of the major code in the table is denoted by 4 and 7. Therefore, in case that the input frequency is corresponding to Mo' tone, a number of harmony frequencies harmonizing with the input frequency becomes a frequency corresponding to *mi' tone and Mol' tone, respectively.<br>
If the input frequency applied from input means 11 is about 690 Thz (435 nm of wavelength) corresponding to blue, the harmony frequency corresponding to a minor code can be operated as following. Since the harmony frequency ratio n is 3 and 7, respectively, Fh2 =690x(12√2)3 THZ = 820.55 THz (365.61 nm of wavelength), and Fh2 = 690 x O^T)7 THz=1033.83 THz (290.18 nm of wavelength).<br>
Since Fh2   is out of the range of visible frequency, if<br>
the operated harmony frequency is  out  of the  range of visible frequency, the first operation unit 17 divides the operated harmony by 2 to prevent the harmony frequency from being out of the range of visible frequency.  Accordingly, Fh2 becomes 516.92 Thz (580.36 nm) which is divided by 2.<br>
Also, in conventional 12 musical scales of average rate, if a frequency of one octave is divided by a constant interval of log ratio, the frequency interval with adjacent tone is identical as ('-v/z)1 at any tone. However, in case of the just temperament, since a next tone is made in a fractional type by reference to Mo' tone, the frequency interval is not constant with that of the adjacent tone. However, since the just temperament is superior to the average ratio, it has been used.<br>
In case of dividing the musical scale by the jus; temperament, in order to operate the harmony frequency, a frequency ratio of fractional type corresponding to the harmony frequency ratio (referred to as a just temperamene frequency ratio)' n is derived by reference to a main frequency (a frequency corresponding to 'dc' tone). FIG.7 shows the just temperament frequency ratio corresponding to each the musical scale by reference to the main frequency.<br>
For example, if the input frequency applied from the input means 11 is 4 60 Thz corresponding to red, and the harmony frequency ratio n derived from the table  1 by<br>
seacting the major code is 4 and 7, respectively, the just temperament frequency ratio corresponding to 4 and 7 of harmony frequency ratio is 5/4 and 3/2, respectively, and thus, Fh1 = 460 x 5/4 Thz = 575 Thz, Fh2 = 460 x 3/2 Thz = 690 Thz .<br>
The display means 16 converts the inputted harmony frequency into a visible ray, and displays the harmony color on a screen of a monitor.<br>
FIG. 9 shows a state displayed on a monitor of a computer for explaining one example of a method for selecting the harmony color according to the present invention. As shown in FIG. 9, if a user clicks a harmonics code list on a left window, the harmonics code list displays on a center window. For example, if the user selects a 'SUS4' code on the displayed harmonics code list, 3 harmony colors are displayed in all octave and a 1 3 octave selected on a right window, respectively, and a harmony frequency geometry of 'SUS4' is displayed on a hue circle. If the user selects a reference color on the hue circle, the related harmony colors on the harmony color display window are changed and displayed.<br>
FIG. 10 shows a state displayed on a monitor of a computer for explaining another example of a method for selecting the harmony color according to the present invention.   FIG. 10 shows each harmony selection display<br>
ac ording to the harmonics codes 'AUG' and "7/ALT' . Each harmony color selection display is displayed on a left with a harmony display window of the harmonics code, a luminance selection bar, a saturation selection bar, and a hue circle, and is displayed on a right with harmony colors of the harmonics codes prepared in a table. If the user selects a reference color on the hue circle in the right, the colors on the harmony color display window are changed.<br>
FIG. 11 show a block diagram of a sound/color converting apparatus according to one preferred embodimen";; of the present invention. The apparatus comprises microphones 22 and 24, amplifiers 26 and 28, Fourier transformers 30 and 32, sampling means 34 and 36, sound/color converting operation means 38 and 40, a sound source position operation means 42, display control means 44, a display unit 46, command input means 48, storage means 50, and control means 52.<br>
The sound/color converting apparatus of FIG. 11 inputs sounds of 2 channels L and R through the microphones 22 and 24 for inputting the sound from the sound source 20. The inputted sound signals of the channels L and R are amplified through the amplifiers 2 6 and 28, the amplified signals are transformed through a fast Fourier function in a unit of every frame at the Fourier transformers 30 and 32, respectively.  The Fourier-transformed signal is filtered by<br>
a ""lesired filtering algorithm at the sampling means 34 and 36, and peak values of the filtered signal are classified in order of sound pressure, so that a desired number of peak values, for example, up to 30, are sampled. The peak values of the sampled signals have a value of frequency and a value of sound pressure, respectively. Each signal is transformed into a visible frequency by the function of the sound/color conversion at the sound/color converting operation means 38 and 40.<br>
For example, the inputted audible frequency fi is 329.6 Hz corresponding to 'mi' tone of 4 octave, and a constant C indicates 0.29 by the reference frequency corresponding to red. If the minimum audible frequency f1 and the minimum visible frequency F1 are set to 20 Hz and 350 Thz, respectively, the visible frequency to be derived from the above equation is 441 Thz, and the luminance of the color to be obtained is 4.33 (43.3%) relative to an operated value x.<br>
The peak values of the sampled signal are provided to sound source operation means 42. The sound source operation means 42 operates the sound source positioned of two signals of the channels L and R at the same frequency.<br>
FIG. 12 is a flow chart explaining the process of operating the sound source generation position according to a first embodiment of present invention.<br>
As shown in FIG. 13, supposing that the actual sound<br>
source is known, and the area to which the sound source moves is defined between the first and the second channels, the process in FIG. 12 operates the position generating the sound source between two channels, i.e., the sound source input position of the first channel and the sound source input position of the second channel, among a number of channels.<br>
In the figure, a reference numeral d denotes a distance from the sound source input.position of the first channel to the sound source input position of the second channel, s denotes a distance extending at right angle from a straight line extending between the sound source input positions of twc channels to the actual sound source, and a denotes a value of the sound source generating position to be obtained with the sound input position of a particular channel (for example, the first channel) being set to zero.<br>
The process for operating the value a of the sound source generating position comprises the steps of receiving the signal of the sound source every channel (step 100) , operating the audible freguency inputted through each channel at a desired frequency interval in such a way of fast Fourier transform (referred to as FFT) based on the control signal and the sound source signal every channel (step 101), and detecting one or more peak points every channel based on the results of the FFT operation  (step<br>
Specifically, FIG. 14 is a frequency spectrum showing the results of FFT operation of the audible frequency every channel at one frame. The horizontal axis and the vertical axis indicate a frequency axis and a sound pressure level axis, respectively. The figure shows the analysis results of the electrical signal of inputted sound in a dimension of sound pressure by frequency. Based on the FFT operation results, regarding to the same frequency, it detects a number of peak points consisting of the first peak point (P:), the second peak point (P2) , and the third peak point (P3), at the first channel, and it detects a number of peak points consisting of the first peak point (Pi'), the second peak point (P2' ) , and the third peak point (P3' ) , at the second channel.<br>
It detects an interested frequency at each peak poin; detected by a channel, and detects a value of sound pressure level conversed in a dB scale, and operates the sound pressure differences every an interested frequency to output Idirf (step 103) . In order words, in case of comparing the first peak point at the first and second channels, the Idiff means a result of a value of the sound pressure level of P1 minus a value of the sound pressure level of P1' , and operates the generation position a of the sound source every the  peak  generation  frequency  based  on  the  following<br>
equation according to the output  Idiff and predetermined values s and d.<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
wherein,  a is  a value of  sound source  generating<br>
position to be obtained by setting the sound source input:<br>
position of the first channel to zero, k is a constant of i<br>
&gt; 0, d is a distance from the sound source input position of<br>
the first channel to the sound source input position of the<br>
second channel, and s is a distance extending at right angle<br>
from a straight line extending between the sound source<br>
input positions of two channels to the actual sound source.<br>
By reference to the equation, it operates the sound source generating position a every each peak generating frequency (step 104), and in case of a  d/2, determining in that the sound source generating position is adjacent to the second channel (step 107) . It outputs the frequency value and the sound pressure level of each detected peak point, and the value of operated sound source generating position (step 108).<br>
The display control means 44 outputs a visible ray based on the sound source generating position, and a frequency value and a sound pressure level of each peak point, and, as shown in FIG. 15, displays the color operated<br>
from the frequency of the sound source an area relative to the sound pressure by reference to the equation 3, with the sound source generating position being set to an axis of the first coordinates corresponding to the horizontal axis, and the frequency value of each sound source being set to an axis of the second coordinates corresponding to the vertical axis.<br>
Accordingly, the display control means 44 displays easily the sound source generating position every peax: generating frequency, the color corresponding to the sound source, and the magnitude of the sound pressure on two dimension of plane combining the first and the second axis.<br>
Since the embodiment operates the sound source generating position every interested frequency with peax thereof detected, even though it analyzes the frequency inputted from the sound source generated at one point, the value of the sound source generating position every peak generating frequency in one frame is different to each other, while the second, embodiment can derive the same value of sound source generating position in one frame.<br>
FIG. 16 is a flow chart for explaining the process of the operation of the sound source generating position according to a second embodiment of the present invention.<br>
As shown in FIG. 16, supposing the distance d between two channels, i.e., the sound source input position of the<br>
first channel and the sound source input position of the second channel, among a number of channels is unknown, the position of the actual sound source and the sound source moving area are not defined between the first and the second channels, and the sound source moves along the axis perpendicular to the axis connecting the first and the second channel, it detects the sound source generating position with the middle position between two channel being zero.<br>
The process for operating the value a of the sound source generating position comprises the steps of receiving the signal of the sound source every channel, (step 110), FET operating the audible frequency inputted through each channel at a desired frequency interval (step 111), and detecting one or more peak points every channel based on the results of the FFT operation (step 112).<br>
J^aiff    -L^-l-energy — -Ll^-energy<br>
at that time, Energy = Σ(P12 + P22 + ... Pn2) wherein, Ediff is a value of the sound source generating position with the middle position between two channels being zero, Pn is a value of sound pressure level having a detected peak, n is a number of detected peak, M1energy is a value of sound pressure energy of the first channel, ana M2nergy is a value of sound pressure energy of the second channel.<br>
By reference to the equation, it operates M1energy and M2energy according to the value of the sound pressure level every interested frequency having peak point detected at the first and the second channel, detects Ediff according to the results of M1energy ~ M2energy. It determines the Ediff is a positive number or a negative number (step 115), and in case of Ediff &gt; 0, determining in that the sound source generating position is adjacent to the first channel (step 116), while in case of Ediff 
FIG. 18 shows one example of which the display means can display. The configuration of the display is identical to that of the first embodiment, and the sound source generating position every frequency displayed in a circle is arranged in a straight line paralleled with the second axis.<br>
FIG. 19 is a flow chart for explaining the process of the operation of the sound source generating position according to the third embodiment of the present invention. The embodiment is characterized by operating the sound source generating position every a band of frequency, in which the supposition on the actual position of the sound<br>
source and the sound source moving area is identical to that of the second embodiment, and the steps 120 to 122 in FIG. 19 are identical to those of the first embodiment.<br>
The process for operating the value a of the sound source generating position comprises the steps of detecting one or more peak points every detected channel (step 122), and dividing the frequency every a band based on a desired frequency division reference (step 123) . For example, in case of dividing the frequency into three areas, the audible frequency is divided into a band of low frequency (20 to 200 Hz: , a band of middle frequency (200 to 2 kHz), and a band of high frequency (2 kHz to 2 0 kHz).<br>
By reference to the equation, according to the value of the sound pressure level every a peak point detected at the band of low frequency, it operates the sound pressure energy Mlenergy/iow of the first channel and the sound pressure energy M2energy/iow of the second channel (step 124), respectively, operates Ediff based on the sound pressure energy detected at each channel (step 125), and determines whether the Edlff/iow is a positive number or a negative number (step 125) . In case of Ediff/iow &gt; 0, it determines in that at the band of low frequency the sound source generating position is adjacent to the first channel (step 126), while in case of Ediff/low 
Based on the same principle, according to the value of sound pressure level of each peak point detected at bands of the middle and high frequency,  it operates M1energy/mid and<br>
M2energy/mid,      Mlenergy/high      and     M2 energy/high,        (steps      128      and      132;,<br>
respectively, operates Ediff/mid and Ediff/high based on the sound pressure energy detected at each channel, and determines whether the Ediff/mid and the Ediff/high are a positive number or a negative number to determine the sound source generating position at the bands of the middle and high frequency<br>
(steps 129 to 131, and steps 132 to 135), respectively. And then, the display control means 44 displays the frequency value and the sound pressure level of each detected peak point, and the value of operated sound source generating position (step 136).<br>
FIG. 20 shows one example of which the display means can display. The configuration of the display is identical to that of the above embodiments, and according to the operation of the sound source generating position every the band of frequency at one frame, the sound source generating position every frequency displayed in a circle is arranged in a straight line paralleled with the second axis.<br>
In case of receiving a midi signal from a midi apparatus as an information of the sound without receiving from the sound source, since the midi signal has a position<br>
information of sound source having a channel different to each other, an information of musical instrument, and an information of scale, using 'a particular protocol, it is not necessary to operate the frequency of the sound source and the sound source generating position through the frequency analysis (FFT operation).<br>
In case of receiving and reproducing the midi signal and visualizing it, since a particular harmonic tone constructing information (a particular interval, a particular magnitude, and an overtone generated in a particular number at a high frequency part centered on a main tone) corresponding to the musical instrument is stored in the storage means, the harmonic tone is reproduced according to the musical scale information so that an inherent sound of the musical instrument can be reproduced. Simultaneously, the information of the sound source generating position is displayed on the first axis, and the main sound (musical scale information) and the musical scale information of the harmonic tone (predetermined value according to the musical instrument information) are displayed on the second axis. The related magnitude and the color are displayed on the position.<br>
Accordingly, in case of receiving the midi signal, since the information having different shapes every the channel  (in  order  words,  musical  instrument)  may  be<br>
d. .splayed, and since there is no the FFT operation, the cost is inexpensive, and the apparatus of the present invention can be applied to the conventional midi signal reproducing apparatus.<br>
The display control means 44 can display the information of inputted peak as a visible ray having a surface area relative to the magnitude of the sound source generating position every a frequency, and a color corresponding to the frequency. In another embodiment of transforming the sound into the color and visualizing it, it uses the distributing state of coordinates as a keyframe of animation based on the frequency and the sound source generating position of each peak, and the motions of the animation can be displayed in response to the sound source generating position and the pitch of the tone by mapping the keyframe.<br>
Specifically, by operating the sound source generating position of each peak, the display control means 44 receives two dimensional coordinate value, based on the frequency and the sound source generating position of each peak, as the keyframe information, and transforms the sound source generating position and the pitch of the tone into the motions of the animation (for example, a dancing doll) by mapping the keyframe information to display it. Thus, the display  control  means  44  displays  the  motions  of  the<br>
a. mation based on the information of the motions.<br>
