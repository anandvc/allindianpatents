				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>Film<br>
This invention relates to a multilayer film with<br>
excellent optical and mechanical properties which can be<br>
formed into a container, e.g. a pouch, based on<br>
polyolefins which are easy to process. In particular,<br>
the invention concerns a multilayer film or pouch<br>
fashioned therefrom comprising a layer of multimodal<br>
polyethylene, e.g. bimodal linear low density<br>
polyethylene (LLDPE).<br>
The polymer film manufacturer seeks films which<br>
have excellent optical properties, have good sealing<br>
properties and have excellent mechanical properties,<br>
e.g. high impact strength and stiffness. The polymers<br>
used to make the film must also have good<br>
processability, i.e. during the extrusion procedure the<br>
bubble formed must be stable and the extruded film<br>
should have an even film distribution thickness.<br>
In recent years, multilayer films have been formed<br>
into standing pouches. The standing pouch market has<br>
grown rapidly as more and more retailers offer their<br>
products for sale in such pouches. Their use in the<br>
food and drinks industry in particular has become<br>
widespread. Such pouches generally replace blow moulded<br>
polyolefin bottles on the supermarket shelves so the<br>
retailer is expecting that the pouches he uses should<br>
have comparable properties to such bottles at lower<br>
cost.<br>
These pouches are fabricated from multilayer<br>
polymer films which require certain properties to be<br>
effective. Thus, like the film producer, the pouch<br>
manufacturer seeks products which have excellent<br>
mechanical properties, e.g. high impact strength, tear<br>
strength, puncture resistance and stiffness. Stiffness<br>
is essential in order to allow pouches to stand without<br>
collapsing under their own weight. Stiffness is also<br>
essential to allow the end user to dispense the pouch<br>
contents by pouring "Without the pouch deforming'under<br>
the pressure of the user's grip. Higher stiffness also<br>
allows an increase in the throughput in the pouch making<br>
machinery.<br>
The film and hence walls of a pouch must be<br>
scalable in order to allow formation of the pouch from a<br>
film sheet. The film and pouch manufacturer is thus<br>
looking for products with good hot tack and broad<br>
sealing windows.<br>
Moreover, as mentioned above the polyolefins used<br>
in the film and hence pouch construction must be readily<br>
processable, e.g. must be readily extrudable.<br>
Unfortunately, the skilled man faces the problem<br>
that when improving one property, it seems inevitable<br>
that another property is adversely affected.<br>
For example, low density polyethylene (LDPE) gives<br>
rise to films having good optical properties and can be<br>
processed at low temperatures and pressures whilst<br>
maintaining melt strength however films made from LDPE<br>
have low stiffness.<br>
Conventional unimodal Ziegler-Natta produced linear<br>
low density polyethylenes (znLLDPE's) have excellent<br>
tear strength and impact properties but stiffness and<br>
impact remain poor and the films tend to be very hazy.<br>
Optical properties have been improved by using<br>
metallocene linear low density polyethylenes but at the<br>
expense of processabilty. These polymers exhibit poor<br>
bubble stability during film blowing.<br>
Various blends of these materials have been<br>
proposed in the art to try to maximise film performance<br>
by combining the advantageous properties of certain<br>
polymers. Thus for example, LDPE and mLLDPE have been<br>
blended to form films however such films have poor<br>
stiffness. Medium density polyethylene made by<br>
metallocene catalysis has been blended with LDPE (EP-A-<br>
1108749) to form films.<br>
The skilled polymer chemist still seeks" therefore<br>
films and pouches made therefrom having excellent<br>
mechanical and processing properties, e.g. manifested by<br>
excellent bubble stability during extrusion. In<br>
addition, improved optical properties are desired, in<br>
particular in film applications.<br>
The present inventors have surprisingly found that<br>
a multilayer film comprising at least three layers can<br>
fulfil these requirements. The film comprises two outer<br>
layers which are preferably identical and comprise a<br>
LLDPE component which should exhibit good hot tack and<br>
possess a broad sealing window, e.g. an mLLDPE component<br>
optionally blended with an LDPE component, whilst the<br>
core layer, i.e. a layer sandwiched between two outer<br>
layers, comprises a multimodal polyethylene preferably<br>
produced in a two stage process, e.g. a multimodal<br>
LLDPE, having a low density, high molecular weight<br>
component, optionally blended with mLLDPE or LDPE<br>
components.<br>
Thus, viewed from one aspect, the invention<br>
provides a multilayer film comprising at least three<br>
layers, two outer layers and a core layer, each outer<br>
layer independently comprising an LLDPE component, e.g.<br>
at least 50%wt of LLDPE component, preferably having a<br>
density of less than 940 kg/m3 and said core layer<br>
comprising a multimodal polyethylene component having a<br>
lower molecular weight component and a higher molecular<br>
weight component, wherein the density of the higher<br>
molecular weight component is less than 915 kg/m3 and the<br>
MFRa of the higher molecular weight component is less<br>
than 1 g/10 min.<br>
Viewed from another aspect the invention provides a<br>
process for the preparation of a multilayer film as<br>
hereinbefore described comprising coextruding a<br>
composition comprising a LLDPE component, preferably<br>
having a density of less than 940 kg/m3 to form two outer<br>
layers and a multimodal polyethylene component having a<br>
lower molecular weight component and a higher molecular<br>
weight component, wherein the density of the higher<br>
molecular weight component is less than 915 kg/m3 and the<br>
MFR2 of the higher molecular weight component is less<br>
than 1 g/10 min to form a core layer.<br>
Viewed from another aspect the invention provides<br>
use of a multilayer film as hereinbefore described in<br>
packaging as well as an article packaged using said<br>
film.<br>
Viewed from another aspect the invention provides a<br>
pouch formed from said multilayer film, preferably a<br>
standing pouch.<br>
The multilayer film of the invention has at least<br>
three layers, e.g. 3, 5, 7 or 11 layers. Preferably<br>
however the film should comprise only three layers, two<br>
outer layers and a core layer and optionally a barrier<br>
layer as described more fully below. By core layer is<br>
meant a non outer layer, i.e. the core layer is not on<br>
the surface of the formed film.<br>
The outer layers may have differing compositions<br>
although preferably the outer layers should be<br>
identical. At least one of the outer layers may act as<br>
a sealing layer to allow fabrication of articles from<br>
the film, e.g. pouches. The other outer layer may be<br>
laminated to a barrier layer. The outer layers may<br>
comprise at least 50 wt% of a LLDPE component having a<br>
density of less than 940 kg/m3. Preferably, the LLDPE is<br>
a unimodal, especially a tnLLDPE (i.e. one produced using<br>
single site, e.g. metallocene catalysis), most<br>
especially a unimodal mLLDPE. By unimodal is meant that<br>
the molecular weight profile of the polymer comprises a<br>
single peak and is produced by one reactor and a single<br>
catalyst. Especially preferably, the outer layers<br>
comprise a unimodal mLLDPE component and an LDPE<br>
component.<br>
LLDPE's should preferably form at least 60 %wt,<br>
more preferably at 75% by weight, e.g. at least 80% wt,<br>
especially at least 85% wt of each outer layer.<br>
The LLDPE may have a density of less than 945 kg/m3,<br>
preferably less than 940 kg/m3, e.g. 905-940 kg/m3,<br>
preferably in the range of from 915 to 934 kg/m3, such as<br>
918 to 934 kg/m3, e.g. 920 to 930 kg/m3 (ISO 1183) .<br>
The LLDPE of the outer layer is formed from<br>
ethylene along with at least one C3.12 alpha-olefin<br>
comonomer, e.g. butene, hexene or octene. Preferably,<br>
the LLDPE is an ethylene hexene copolymer, ethylene<br>
octene copolymer or ethylene butene copolymer. The<br>
amount of. comonomer incorporated is preferably 0.5 to 12<br>
mol%, e.g. 2 to 10% mole relative to ethylene,<br>
especially 4 to 8% mole. Preferred comonomer contents<br>
may also be 1.5 to 10 wt%, especially 2 to 8 wt%.<br>
The MFR2 (melt flow rate ISO 1133 at 190°C under a<br>
load of 2.16 kg) of the LLDPE should preferably be in<br>
the range 0.5 to 10, preferably 0.8 to 6.0, e.g. 0.9 to<br>
2.0 g/lOmin.<br>
The LLDPE should preferably have a weight average<br>
molecular weight (Mw) of 100,000-250,000, e.g. 110,000-<br>
160,000 (GPC). The Mw/Mn value should preferably be 2<br>
to 20, e.g. 2.5 to 4, especially 3.0 to 3.5 (GPC).<br>
Ideally, the LLDPE is made by single site, e.g.<br>
metallocene catalysis and is therefore designated an<br>
mLLDPE. The use of metallocene catalysis to make<br>
LLDPE's is known and widely described in the literature.<br>
It is within the scope of the invention for the<br>
LLDPE to be a multimodal LLDPE, e.g. a bimodal LLDPE, as<br>
described fully in connection with the core layer below.<br>
The possibility of using mixtures of LLDPE's is also<br>
covered, e.g. a unimodal LLDPE and a bimodal LLDPE.<br>
Suitable LLDPE'e are available commercially from<br>
Borealis and other suppliers.<br>
One or both outer layers of the multilayer film of<br>
the invention may also contain an LDPE component. LDPE<br>
is a prepared using "a well-known high pressure radical<br>
process as will be known to the skilled man and is a<br>
different polymer from an LLDPE.<br>
The amount of LDPE present may range from 1 to 50%<br>
wt, e.g. 3 to 40 wt%, preferably 5 to 35% by weight,<br>
preferably 10 to 30 wt%, especially 15 to 20 wt% of the<br>
outer layer in question. Conveniently therefore the<br>
ratio LLPDE to LDPE in the outer layer is about 9:1.<br>
The LDPE may have a density of 915-935 kg/m3,<br>
especially 920-930 kg/m3, e.g. 922 to 930 kg/m3. The<br>
MFR2 of the LDPE may range from 0.3 to 4 g/lOmin, e.g.<br>
0.5 to 2.5 g/10 min, e.g. 1.0 to 2.0 g/10 min. Suitable<br>
LDPE's are available commercially from Borealis and<br>
other suppliers.<br>
Such an outer layer construction is believed to<br>
contribute to a low seal initiation temperature and<br>
excellent hot tack properties.<br>
The outer layers may also contain other polymer<br>
components if necessary and may also contain minor<br>
amounts of conventional additives such as antioxidants,<br>
UV stabilisers, acid scavengers, nucleating agents,<br>
anti-blocking agents, slip agents etc as well as polymer<br>
processing agent (PPA). Polymer processing agents are<br>
available from commercial suppliers such as Dynamar and<br>
may include a fluoroelastomer component and can be added<br>
to the outer layer blend as part of a masterbatch as is<br>
known in the art.<br>
A specific film may comprise a first outer layer<br>
comprising a unimodal LLDPE and LDPE blend with the<br>
other outer layer being formed from a multimodal LLDPE,<br>
optionally combined with an LDPE component.<br>
The core layer of the film of the invention is one<br>
sandwiched between two outer layers. The core layer of<br>
the multilayer film of the invention comprises a<br>
multimodal polyethylene component having a lower<br>
molecular weight component and a higher molecular weight<br>
component, wherein the density of the higher molecular<br>
weight component is less than 915 kg/m3, preferably less<br>
than 905 kg/m3 and the MFR2 of the higher molecular<br>
weight component is less than 1 g/10 min, e.g. a bimodal<br>
LLDPE, preferably a Ziegler-Natta bimodal LLDPE.<br>
Alternatively viewed the core layer of the<br>
multilayer film of the invention comprises a multimodal<br>
LLDPE, i.e. one with a higher and lower molecular weight<br>
component.<br>
Thus, viewed from another aspect, the invention<br>
provides a multilayer film comprising at least three<br>
layers, two outer layers and a core layer, each outer<br>
layer independently comprising an LLDPE -component and<br>
said core layer comprising a multimodal LLDPE component<br>
For example, therefore, the film might be a multilayer<br>
film comprising at least three layers, two outer layers<br>
and a core layer, each outer layer independently<br>
comprising a unimodal mLLDPE and LDPE and said core<br>
layer comprising a multimodal LLDPE.<br>
It has been surprisingly found that the core layer<br>
polymer can provide the film with excellent mechanical<br>
and processing properties. Moreover, the mLLDPE<br>
component which may be used in the outer layers provides<br>
excellent optical properties. The outer layers also<br>
contribute to a low seal initiation temperature (110°C)<br>
and excellent hot tack properties.<br>
The multimodal polyethylene can be the only<br>
polyolefin employed in the core layer and preferably the<br>
core layer should comprise at least 50% wt, e.g. at<br>
least 60% wt of the multimodal polyethylene. In<br>
addition, the core layer may comprise up to 50% wt, e.g.<br>
up to 40% wt, preferably up to 30% wt LDPE. Suitable<br>
LDPE's are those described above in connection with the<br>
outer layers of the multilayer film.<br>
The core layer may alternatively comprise up to 25%<br>
wt, e.g. up to 20% wt of unimodal LLDPE, e.g. mLLDPE as<br>
described above.<br>
The film as a whole should have a multimodal<br>
polyethylene content of between 30 and 40 wt%, e.g.<br>
about 35% wt. .<br>
The polyethylene component, e.g. LLDPE, in this<br>
core layer must be multimodal, preferably bimodal, i.e.<br>
its molecular weight profile does not comprise a single<br>
peak but instead comprises the combination of two or<br>
more peaks (which may or may not be distinguishable)<br>
centred about different average molecular weights as a<br>
result of the fact that the polymer comprises two or<br>
more separately produced components.<br>
Multimodal polyethylenes are typically made in more<br>
than one reactor each having different conditions. The<br>
components are typically so different that they show<br>
more than one peak or shoulder in the diagram usually<br>
given as result of its GPC (gel permeation<br>
chromatograph) curve, where d(log(MW)) is plotted as<br>
ordinate vs log(MW), where MW is molecular weight.<br>
Thus, the multimodal polyethylene comprises a<br>
higher molecular weight component which preferably<br>
corresponds to an ethylene copolymer (or terpolymer) of<br>
a higher alpha-olefin comonomer and a lower molecular<br>
weight component which preferably corresponds to an<br>
ethylene homopolymer or an ethylene copolymer (or<br>
terpolymer) of a lower alpha-olefin comonomer.<br>
Preferably the polyethylene in the core layer is formed<br>
from an ethylene homopolymer and an ethylene butene,<br>
ethylene octene or ethylene hexene copolymer.<br>
Such multimodal polymers may be prepared for<br>
example by two or more stage polymerization or by the<br>
use of two or more different polymerization catalysts in<br>
a one stage polymerization. It is also possible to<br>
employ a dualsite catalyst. It is important to ensure<br>
that the higher and lower molecular weight components<br>
are intimately mixed prior to extrusion to form a film.<br>
This is most advantageously achieved by using a<br>
multistage process or a dual site but could be achieved<br>
through blending.<br>
To maximise homogeneity, particularly when a blend<br>
is employed, it is preferred if the multimodal<br>
polyethylene used in the core layer is extruded prior to<br>
being extruded to form the film of the invention. This<br>
preextrusion step ensures that the higher molecular<br>
weight component will be homogeneously distributed<br>
though the core layer and minimises the possibility of<br>
gel formation in the film.<br>
Preferably the multimodal polyethylene is produced<br>
in a two-stage polymerization using the same catalyst,<br>
e.g. a metallocene catalyst or preferably a Ziegler-<br>
Natta catalyst. Thus, two slurry reactors or two gas<br>
phase reactors could be employed. Preferably however,<br>
the multimodal polyethylene is made using a slurry<br>
polymerization in a loop reactor followed by a gas phase<br>
polymerization in a gas phase reactor.<br>
A loop reactor - gas phase reactor system is<br>
marketed by Borealis A/S, Denmark as a BORSTAR reactor<br>
system. The multimodal polyethylene in the core layer<br>
is thus preferably formed in a two stage process<br>
comprising a first slurry loop polymerisation followed<br>
by gas phase polymerisation in the presence of a<br>
Ziegler-Natta catalyst.<br>
The conditions used in such a process are well<br>
known. For slurry reactors, the reaction temperature<br>
will generally be in the range 60 to 110°C (e.g. 85-<br>
110°C), the reactor pressure will generally be in the<br>
range 5 to 80 bar (e.g. 50-65 bar), and the residence<br>
time will generally be in the range 0.3 to 5 hours (e.g.<br>
0.5 to 2 hours). The diluent used will generally be an<br>
aliphatic hydrocarbon having a boiling point in the<br>
range -70 to +100°C. In such reactors, polymerization<br>
may if desired be effected under supercritical<br>
conditions. Slurry polymerisation may also be carried<br>
out in bulk where the reaction medium is formed from the<br>
monomer being polymerised.<br>
For gas phase reactors, the reaction temperature<br>
used will generally be in the range 60 to 115°C (e.g. 70<br>
to 110°C) , the reactor pressure will generally be in the<br>
range 10 to 25 bar, and the residence time will<br>
generally be 1 to 8 hours. The gas used will commonly<br>
be a non-reactive gas such as nitrogen or low boiling<br>
point hydrocarbons such as propane together with monomer<br>
(e.g. ethylene) .<br>
Preferably, the lower molecular weight polymer<br>
fraction is produced in a continuously operating loop<br>
reactor where ethylene is polymerised in the presence of<br>
a polymerization catalyst as stated above and a chain<br>
transfer agent such as hydrogen. The diluent is<br>
typically an inert aliphatic hydrocarbon, preferably<br>
isobutane or propane.<br>
The higher molecular weight component can then be<br>
formed in a gas phase reactor using the same catalyst.<br>
The lower molecular weight component preferably has<br>
a MPR2 of at least 50, preferably at least 100 g/lOmin,<br>
preferably 110 to 3000 g/lOmin, e.g. 110 to 500 g/lOmin,<br>
especially 150 to 400 g/lOmin. The molecular weight of<br>
the low molecular weight component should preferably<br>
range from 20,000 to 50,000, e.g. 25,000 to 40,000.<br>
Preferred molecular weight distribution values for the<br>
low molecular weight component range from 2 to 15, e.g.<br>
3 to 12, preferably 5 to 8.<br>
The density of the lower molecular weight component<br>
may range from 940 to 980 kg/m3, e.g. 945 to 975 kg/m3<br>
preferably 950 to 970 kg/m3, especially 960 to 970 kg/m3.<br>
The lower molecular weight component should<br>
preferably form 30 to 70 wt%, e.g. 40 to 60% by weight<br>
of the multimodal polyethylene with the higher molecular<br>
weight component forming 70 to 30 wt%, e.g. 40 to 60% by<br>
weight.<br>
The Higher molecular weight component should have a<br>
lower MFR2 and a lower density than the lower molecular<br>
weight component.<br>
The higher molecular weight component should have<br>
an MFR2 of less than 1 g/10 min, preferably less than 0.5<br>
g/10 min, especially less than 0.2 g/lOmin, and a<br>
density of less than 915 kg/m3, e.g. less than 910 kg/m3,<br>
preferably less than 905 kg/m3. The Mw of the higher<br>
molecular weight component may range from 100,000 to<br>
1,000,000, preferably 250,000 to 500,000.<br>
Where the higher molecular weight component is made<br>
second in a multistage polymerisation it is not possible<br>
to measure its properties directly. However, the<br>
skilled man is able to determine the density, MFR2 etc of<br>
the higher molecular weight component using Kim<br>
McAuley's equations. Thus, both density and MFR2 can be<br>
found using K. K. McAuley and J. F. McGregor: On-line<br>
Inference of Polymer Properties in an Industrial<br>
Polyethylene Reactor, AIChE Journal, June 1991, Vol. 37,<br>
No, 6, pages 825-835.<br>
The density is calculated from McAuley's equation<br>
37, where final density and density after the first<br>
reactor is known.<br>
MFR2 is calculated from McAuley's equation 25, where<br>
final MFR2 and MFR2 after the first reactor is<br>
calculated. The use of these equations to calculate<br>
polymer properties in multimodal polymers is common<br>
place.<br>
The multimodal polyethylene overall may have a<br>
density of 900-945 kg/m3, e.g. 910 to 940 kg/m3,<br>
preferably 915 to 935 kg/m3, preferably 920 to 930 kg/m3.<br>
The MFRa should be in the range 0.05 to 1.2 g/lOmin, e.g.<br>
0.1-0.8 g/lOmin. The MFR.^ should be in the range 5 to<br>
100, preferably 10 to 60 g/lOmin, e.g. 15 to 30 g/10<br>
min. The Mw of the multimodal polyethylene should be in<br>
the range 150,000 to 300,000, preferably 230,000 to<br>
270,000. Mw/Mn should be in the range 10 to 25, e.g. 15<br>
to 25.<br>
The comonomer used in the tnultimodal polyethylene<br>
is preferably a C3.12 alpha olefin or a mixture of two or<br>
more C3.12 alpha olefins, e.g. 1-butene, 1-pentene, 1-<br>
hexene, 4-methyl-1-pentene, 1-heptene, 1-octene, 1-<br>
nonene and 1-decene, with 1-butene and 1-hexene being<br>
preferred. The amount of comonomer incorporated is<br>
preferably 2 to 10% mole relative to ethylene, e.g. 2 to<br>
8% mole, preferably 4 to 6 mol%. Preferred comonomer<br>
contents may also be 1.5 to 10 wt%, especially 2 to 8<br>
wt%.<br>
The multimodal polyethylene may be made using<br>
conventional single site or Ziegler-Natta catalysis as<br>
is known in the art. Conventional cocatalysts,<br>
supports/carriers, electron donors etc can be used.<br>
Many multimodal or bimodal LLDPE's are commercially<br>
available.<br>
The core layer may also comprise other polymer<br>
components if necessary and conventional additives such<br>
as antioxidants, UV stabilisers, acid scavengers,<br>
nucleating agents, anti-blocking agents etc as well as<br>
polymer processing agent (PPA) as described above in<br>
connection with the outer layers. The amounts of PPA<br>
used may be the same as in the outer layer and can be<br>
added to the core layer blend as part of a masterbatch<br>
as is known in the art. The PPA is believed to act as a<br>
lubricant, migrating to the polymer surface during<br>
extrusion to prevent the extrudate sticking to the die.<br>
The films of the invention may have a thickness of<br>
10 to 250 microns, preferably 20 to 200 microns, e.g. 30<br>
to 150 microns, such as e.g. 30 to 50 microns,<br>
preferably 80 to 135 microns. The outer layers and core<br>
layer may all be of equal thickness or alternatively the<br>
core layer may be thicker than each outer layer. A<br>
convenient film comprises two outer layers which each<br>
form 10 to 35%, e.g. 15 to 25% of the thickness of the<br>
film, the core layer forming the remaining thickness,<br>
e.g. 30 to 70%.<br>
For film formation using a polymer mixture it is<br>
important that the different polymer components be<br>
intimately mixed prior to extrusion and blowing of the<br>
film as otherwise there is a risk of inhomogeneities,<br>
e.g. gels, appearing in the film. Thus, it is<br>
especially preferred to thoroughly blend the components,<br>
for example using a twin screw extruder, preferably a<br>
counter-rotating extruder prior to extrusion and film<br>
blowing. Sufficient homogeneity can also be obtained by<br>
selecting the screw design for the film extruder such<br>
that it is designed for good mixing and homogenising.<br>
The film of the invention will typically be<br>
produced by extrusion through an annular die, blowing<br>
into a tubular film by forming a bubble which is<br>
collapsed between nip rollers after solidification.<br>
This film can then be slit, cut or converted (e.g.<br>
gusseted) as desired. Conventional film production<br>
techniques may be used in this regard. Typically the<br>
outer and core layer mixtures will be coextruded at a<br>
temperature in the range 160°C to 240°C, and cooled by<br>
blowing gas (generally air) at a temperature of 10 to<br>
50°C to provide a frost line height of 1 or 2 to 8 times<br>
the diameter of the die. The blow up ratio should<br>
generally be in the range 1.5 to 4, e.g. 2 to 4,<br>
preferably 2.5 to 3.<br>
The films of the invention exhibit high dart impact<br>
strengths and tear strengths, especially in the<br>
transverse direction. Thus for a 40 micron film of the<br>
invention, Dart drop F50 (ISO 7765/1) may be at least<br>
180 g, preferably at least 250 g» Thus, Dart drop F50<br>
(ISO 7765/1) may be at least 5 g/micron film thickness.<br>
Elmendorr Tear strength in the machine/transverse<br>
direction for a film of the invention may be at least<br>
0.03N/micron (MD) and O.lSN/micron (TD) respectively<br>
(ISO 6382-2} .<br>
Elmendorf Tear resistances in the transverse direction<br>
for a 40 micron film may be at least 6.5 N.<br>
1% Secant modulus properties (ASTM D882) in the<br>
machine/transverse direction should be at least 250<br>
MPa/300MPa.<br>
The films exhibit excellent haze properties, e.g.<br>
less than 10%, preferably less than 8% (ASTM D1003) for<br>
a 40 micron film whilst exhibiting high levels of gloss,<br>
e.g. &gt;100 (ASTM D2457).<br>
The films may have high tensile strength at yield<br>
in the transverse direction, e.g. at least 120 kg/cm2,<br>
preferably at least 200 kg/cm2. The films may also have<br>
high tensile strength at break in the machine/transverse<br>
direction, e.g. at least 250/220 kg/cm2.<br>
The films also possess a broad sealing window, e.g.<br>
greater than 10°C, preferably greater than 15°C,<br>
especially greater than 25°C.<br>
The films of the invention may incorporate barrier<br>
layers as is known in the art. For food and medical<br>
applications for example, it may be necessary to<br>
incorporate a barrier layer, i.e. a layer which is<br>
impermeable to water and oxygen, into the film<br>
structure. This can be achieved using conventional<br>
lamination techniques. Suitable barrier layers are<br>
known and include polyamide, ethylene vinyl alcohol, PET<br>
and metallised Al layers.<br>
Viewed from another aspect therefore the invention<br>
provides a laminate comprising a multilayer film as<br>
hereinbefore defined laminated onto a barrier layer.<br>
In such an embodiment it may be convenient to<br>
laminate the barrier layer onto two 3-layer films as<br>
hereinbefore described thereby forming a 7 layer film in<br>
which the barrier layer forms the middle layer.<br>
The outer layer to be laminated to the barrier<br>
layer can therefore be regarded as a lamination layer<br>
with the outer layer which remains outermost to be<br>
regarded as a sealing layer.<br>
The' films of the invention can-also incorporate<br>
polypropylene layers.<br>
The films of the invention have a wide variety of<br>
applications but are of particular interest in packaging<br>
of food and drink, consumer and industrial goods,<br>
medical devices and in heavy duty packaging. The films<br>
may act as shrink films and are thus suitable for shrink<br>
applications, e.g. to package goods for transportation.<br>
Goods which may be packaged, especially in pouches<br>
therefore include detergents, soaps, fabric softeners,<br>
refill packets, fruit juices and especially oils and<br>
water. It is envisaged that packages may be from 100 g<br>
to 25 kg in size.<br>
Pouches can be made from the films by known<br>
thermoforming processes. It is especially preferred if<br>
standing pouches are formed (i.e. self supporting<br>
pouches) . Such pouches can be adapted to possess screw<br>
caps and the like to allow easy access to the contents<br>
of the pouch.<br>
Viewed from another aspect the invention provides a<br>
multilayer film comprising at least three layers, two<br>
outer layers and a core layer, each outer layer<br>
independently comprising at least 50%wt of a<br>
polyethylene component having a density of less than 940<br>
kg/m3 and said core layer comprising a multimodal<br>
polyethylene component having a lower molecular weight<br>
component and a higher molecular weight component,<br>
wherein the density of the higher molecular weight<br>
component is less than 915 kg/m3 and the MFR2 of the<br>
higher molecular weight component is less than 1 g/10<br>
min.<br>
The invention will now be described further with<br>
reference to the following non-limiting examples and<br>
Figure. Figure 1 shows the hot tack tests results for<br>
films 11 to 14.<br>
Analytical Tests<br>
Density is measured according to ISO 1183<br>
MFR2/21 are measured according to ISO 1133 at 190°C at<br>
loads of 2.16 and 21.6 kg respectively,<br>
Mw/Mn/MWD are measured by GPC.<br>
Haze is measured according to ASTM D 1003<br>
Gloss is measured according to ASTM D 2457<br>
Elongation at break is measured by ASTM D 882<br>
Tensile Strain at break and tensile strength are<br>
measured according to ISO 527-3<br>
Sec modulus is measured according to ASTM D 882-A<br>
Tensile stress at yield is measured according to ISO<br>
527-3<br>
Impact resistance is determined on Dart-drop (g/50%).<br>
Dart-drop is measured using ISO 7765-1, method "A". A<br>
dart with a 38 mm diameter hemispherical head is dropped<br>
from a height of 0.66 m onto a film clamped over a hole.<br>
If the specimen fails, the weight of the dart is reduced<br>
and if it does not fail the weight is increased. At<br>
least 20 specimens are tested. The weight resulting in<br>
failure of 50% of the specimens is calculated.<br>
Puncture resistance (determined in Ball puncture<br>
(energy/J) at +230C. The method is according to ASTM D<br>
5748. Puncture properties (resistance, energy to break,<br>
penetration distance) are determined by the resistance<br>
of film to the penetration of a probe (19 mm diameter)<br>
at a given speed (250mm/min).<br>
Tear resistance (determined as Elmendorf tear (N) )<br>
The tear strength is measured using the ISO 6383 method.<br>
The force required to propagate tearing across a film<br>
specimen is measured using a pendulum device. The<br>
pendulum swings under gravity through an arc, tearing<br>
the specimen from pre-cut slit. The specimen is fixed<br>
on one side by the pendulum and on the other side by a<br>
stationary clamp. The tear strength is the force<br>
required to tear the specimen.<br>
Hot tack: Hot tack is a test method for measuring the<br>
seal strength of the film just after sealing while the<br>
seal is still hot. This property is measured on a DTC<br>
International Hot tack tester model 52-D, w-4236<br>
according to an internal method. Samples are cut with a<br>
width of 15mm. The sealing time is O.Ssec, a delay time<br>
is 0,lsec and a sealing pressure of 90N. The sealing at<br>
different temperature is measured and for each test<br>
temperature 5 parallels are taken. The specimens have<br>
been conditioned in min- 24 hours before testing.<br>

Example 4<br>
Further films were produced under the same film blowing<br>
conditions as example 3 in which the sealing layer had<br>
the same composition in all films as in film 8 of<br>
Example 3, but the core layers varied.<br>
Four films were produced:<br>
Film 11 - The core layer formed 50% of the film<br>
thickness and consisted of .65% Siam 2045G, 25% HOPE<br>
(Table 4) and 10% white masterbatch (mb). Each outer<br>
layer was the same as aealiny layer. (In total 0% Grade<br>
D). Each outside layer formed 25% of the film thickness<br>
Film 12 - The core layer formed 34% of the film<br>
thickness and consisted of 50% Grade D, 40% Cosmothene<br>
F-210-6 and 10% white MB. Outer layer same as sealing<br>
layer. Each outer layer formed 33% wt of the film<br>
thickness. (In total 17wt% Grade D).<br>
Film 13 - The core layer formed 50% of the film<br>
thickness and consisted of 60% Grade D, 30% Cosmothene<br>
F-210-6 and 10% white MB. Outer layer same as sealing<br>
layer. Each outer layer formed 25%wt of the film<br>
thickness (In total 30wt% Grade D).<br>
Film 14 - The core layer formed 45% of the film<br>
thickness and consisted of 60% Grade D, 30% Cosmothene<br>
F-210-6 and 10% white MB. The sealing layer (forming 30%<br>
of the film thickness) was as in film 8 but the outer<br>
layer (lamination side) was 100% Grade D and formed 25%<br>
of the film thickness (In total 57% Grade D).<br>
The hot tack properties of these films are depicted in<br>
Figure 1. Higher Grade D content gives broader sealing<br>
range and higher seal strength.<br>

(Table Removed)<br>
The films of the invention exhibit excellent stiffness,<br>
dart drop, tear strength, puncture resistance,<br>
sealability and processability. Conventional films do<br>
not possess all these properties.<br>
Thus, whilst mLLDPE films have excellent dart drop, tear<br>
strength, puncture resistance and sealability they have<br>
poor processability and stiffness. LDPE films are not<br>
stiff, have poor dart drop and lack sealing properties.<br>
HOPE films have poor dart drop, tear strength, puncture<br>
resistance and sealability.<br>
Even a laminate of HDPE/LLDPE+LDPE/mLLDPE exhibits poor<br>
dart drop and tear strength. The films of the invention<br>
also show better puncture resistance, sealability and<br>
processability than such a laminate film.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
