A METHOD FOR MEASURING THE OPERATING STATE<br>
OF A SYNCHRONOUS MOTOR USING COMPOSITE<br>
POWER ANGLE METER<br>
WANG, Zhaolei, a Chinese citizen of   Operating Department, Qin Bei Power Plant Of Huaneng, Wulongkou County, 454662 Jiyuan City, Henan Province, China<br>
The following specification particularly describes and ascertains the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a method for measuring the operating state of synchronous motor by using composite power angle meter, which belongs to the field of electrical engineering in electric power systems.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
In the industrial practice of electric power systems, it is necessary to constantly monitor the operating state of a synchronous motor, so as to ensure the synchronous motor to operate in an optimum state. At present, an electric power system generally adopts, at operating locales, various types of meters to display the current, voltage, power and other related electric data of the synchronous motor, especially adopts a power angle meter to measure the power angle and other related electric data of the synchronous motor, and displays the electric power angle vector graph of the synchronous motor through a TV screen (as shown in Figures 6 and 15), so as to provide intuitional electric vector graph for operators.<br>
However, there are disadvantages in various electric measuring meters currently in use. For example, the defects of the power angle meter which is capable of displaying the electric data and electric vector graph of a salient-pole synchronous motor are:<br>
1. The power angle meter can only display the electric power angle vector graph of the synchronous motor (as shown in Figure 6), but it cannot directly display the mechanical relationship between the stator and the rotor of the synchronous motor.<br>
2<br><br>
2.	Although the power angle meter can display the electric power angle vector graph of the synchronous motor and reflect the stator armature potential, magnetic excitation potential, motor-end voltage, power angle and other electric data of the synchronous motor, it cannot display, with optimum segments, the magnitudes of active power and reactive power of the synchronous motor or the magnitudes of active components and reactive components of other parameters of the synchronous motor.<br>
3.	The power angle meter cannot satisfy the requirements of various professionals working in synchronous motor monitoring and operating. With the development of electric technology, a majority of dynamotor sets in the power plants realize the centralized control by programs. Compared with the number of other professionals, the number of electric professionals working in dynamotor monitoring and operating is less and less. However, it is difficult for non-electric professionals to understand the electric power angle vector graph displayed by the power angle meter of the synchronous motor.<br>
4.	The power angle meter cannot be applied to synchronous parallel-network monitoring of the synchronous motor.<br>
5.	The power angle meter cannot display the end magnetic leakage condition of the synchronous motor.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, an object of the present invention aims at providing a method for measuring the operating state of a synchronous motor by using composite power angle meter. The method can intuitionally reflect various operating<br>

The operation of the electric signal data collecting part of the composite power angle meter mainly comprises three steps of:<br>
1. Receiving motor signals by various electric parameter transducers and converting the signals into analogue<br>
13<br><br>
current signals of 0-±20mA.<br>
2.	Converting the current signals outputted from the electric parameter transducers into voltage signals of 0-±5V by the I/V converting circuit.<br>
3.	Inputting the voltage signals of 0—±5V to a data collecting interface card, A/D converting the signals into digital data and storing them in a memory of the computer. Figure 3 illustrates the operation principle of the I/V converting circuit. When the current signals outputted from the transducer pass through resistances R1 and R2  the voltage signals of 0-±5V across R2 are transferred to an A/D conversion device.<br>
4.	Figure 4 is a diagram illustrating the operation principle of the A/D conversion device in the data collection system. The main technical requirements are:<br>
a.	obtaining the instantaneous values of the motor-<br>
end voltage and system voltage at the same time, and<br>
storing them in the memory of the computer to perform<br>
calculation;<br>
That is, the A/D conversion device of the data collection system needs to input the motor-end three phase instantaneous line voltage UAB’   UBC’   UCA  and the system three phase instantaneous line voltage UXAB’   UXBC’   UXCA  at the same time to the computer, and the computer performs calculation on each group of the instantaneous voltages.<br>
b.	The A/D conversion device may collect sufficient<br>
signals, and redundant samples may be used as the backup<br>
for temporary sampling increments.<br>
The composite power angle meter digitizes the inputted electric signals by an A/D chip, and inputs the digitized signals to the host computer through COM or LPT. The host computer performs the computing program process and displaying program process on the inputted signals, and<br>
14<br><br>
depicts the graph illustrating the operating state of the synchronous motor.<br>
When the required calculation can be obtained from other equipments, the electric parameter collection circuit and the computing process may be omitted.<br>
The method for measuring the operating state of the synchronous motor by using the composite power angle meter of the present invention comprises the steps of:<br>
1. obtaining the stator voltage and current signals, magnetic excitation voltage and current signals, magnetic excitation adjustment signal, system voltage and current signals of the synchronous motor, as well as the state signals of the exit switch of the synchronous motor and its magnetic excitation circuit switch;<br>
2 . receiving the related digital signals and electric signals by the data collection part, digitizing the electric signals, and inputting the obtained digital signals to the host computer;<br>
3. inputting the related parameters or commands to the host computer by keyboard and mouse;<br>
4 . performing calculation on the related parameters of the motor and performing the computing program process on the related data by the host computer; after the computing program process, inputting the obtained data to the displaying program to determine instantaneous coordinates of the main points;<br>
5. using the coordinates of the main points to depict various electric and mechanical model graphs of the synchronous motor through the displaying program process by the host computer, and displaying on the display a dynamic composite power angle graph of the synchronous motor and the end composite magnetic leakage graph of the synchronous motor which vary with the motor's parameters.<br>
In terms of different shapes of the motor rotor,<br>
15<br><br>
synchronous motors may be classified as two classifications of salient-pole synchronous motors and non-salient-pole synchronous motors. Accordingly, composite power angle meters of synchronous motor may be classified as composite power angle meters of salient-pole synchronous motor and composite power angle meters of non-salient-pole synchronous motor.<br>
With reference to the different types of synchronous motors, the methods for measuring the different types of motors by using the composite power angle meters will now be described in detail.<br>

2.	Converting the related electric signals into digital signals through the A/D conversion chip of the data collection part of the composite power angle meter, inputting the chip-converted digital signals and the received digital signals to the host computer through COM or LPT, and performing program process on the inputted signals by the computer.<br>

Compared with the single electric power angle vector graph depicted by the conventional power angle meter for measuring the operating state of the motor, the electric model graph, mechanical model graph and motor-end composite magnetic leakage graph depicted by the composite power angle meter of the present invention for measuring the operating state of the synchronous motor have the following advantages:<br>
Comparisons are made in terms of the salient-pole synchronous motor and the non-salient-pole synchronous motor, respectively.<br>
1.    The comparison between the composite power angle meter of the salient-pole synchronous motor and the conventional power angle meter<br>
a)  The composite power angle meter of the salient-pole synchronous motor may display six graphs, and it displays not only the composite power angle of the salient-pole synchronous motor, but also the sub-figures<br>
51<br><br>
of the composite power angle, with reference to Figure 5 to Figure 9; and it realizes the functions of image-alarming and sound-alarming. The PQ curve in the composite power angle graph of Figure 5 defines the locus range of the vertex Eo of the magnetic excitation lever, the composite magnetic leakage graph in Figure 20 defines the composite magnetic leakage range of the stator and rotor that the end heat-emitting of the synchronous motor permits, thus providing intuitional limit graph of the motor parameters for operators; however, the conventional power angle meter only displays the electric vector graph, as shown in Figure 6.<br>
b)	The composite power angle graph (Figure 5) displayed by the composite power angle meter of the salient-pole synchronous motor has double significations: in one aspect, it represents the electric power angle vector graph of the salient-pole synchronous motor, and in another aspect, it represents the mechanical power angle graph showed with the magnetic flux. The power angle represented by the composite power angle graph of the salient-pole motor has both electric and mechanical characteristics. However, the conventional power angle graph only shows electric vectors and only reflects the electric characteristics of the power angle.<br>
c)	The graphs displayed by the composite power angle meter further comprise the mechanical model graph of the synchronous motor, in addition to the electric vector graph. The stator and rotor levers in the mechanical model as shown in Figure 7 are the total composite magnetic flux<br>
££
4m*V        4m*V<br>
springs are   *  and 9'd      respectively (wherein m is the<br>
52<br><br>
phase number of the motor stator, KW  represents the<br>
effective turns of the stator coil, and q   and d   are the quadrature-axis and direct-axis synchronous inductance coefficients of the motor respectively), and the graph simulates the anticlockwise rotations of the motor stator and rotor. The mechanical models shown in Figure 5 and Figure 8 take the stator as a reference object, the stator<br>
lever and rotor lever are £E<t> and   ° respectively, and the elasticity coefficients of the quadrature-axis and<br>
2m*V       2m*V<br>
direct-axis springs are   "      and 9&gt;d      respectively.<br>
The mechanical power angle graph intuitionally reveals the mutual effective relationship between the motor stator and the motor rotor from mechanical aspect, and operators may refer to the mechanical model to understand the principle of the operating of the motor and adjust motor parameters precisely.<br>
d)  Compared with the electric vector graph, the composite power angle graph further includes assistant lines, as shown in Figure 5.<br>
i.    If the lengths of OE0 and OU represent the magnetic excitation potential and the end voltage of the dynamotor respectively, UEq and UEd represent the quadrature-axis component and direct-axis component of the stator potential of the synchronous motor respectively, and EqM and MU represent the active component and reactive component of the stator quadrature-axis potential of the synchronous motor, point M on segment OU or superposing point U respectively represent that the inductive reactive power done by the quadrature-axis potential is negative or zero, point Eq above, below or on the line OU respectively represent that the active power done by the quadrature-axis potential is positive, negative or zero; EdN and NU<br>
