				<td>Sensor in vivo Measurement of Osmotic Changes<br>
Background<br>
The present invention is related to an invasive sensor which can be implanted<br>
subcutaneously, and specially to an invasive sensor comprising at least one differential<br>
pressure-transducer that measures the pressure difference between two fluid volumes<br>
confined by, in one end the at least one differential pressure-transducer, and in the other<br>
end osmotic membranes, as defined in the enclosed independent claims.<br>
The design and production of differential pressure sensors based on silicon micro-<br>
mechanics is known. The Norwegian company SensoNor has developed a technique for<br>
buried piezoresistors. Besides offering excellent long-term stability, this technique<br>
allows contact with water on both sides of the membrane. Using anodic or fusion<br>
bonding, hermetically sealed cavity structures can be obtained<br>
Porous etching (anodic oxidation) of silicon is also a well-known technique. Porous<br>
silicon (PS) is made by electrochemical etching of a silicon wafer in solutions<br>
containing hydrofluoric acid (HF). Usually, HF is sold in an aqueous solution with up to<br>
50 % of HF. Thus, the first attempts to form porous silicon were performed using only<br>
HF diluted in de-ionised and ultra-pure water. Due to the hydrophobic character of the<br>
clean Si surface, absolute ethanol is usually added to the aqueous solution to increase<br>
the wettability of the PS surface. So far this technique is mainly used for making visible<br>
photoluminescence (PL).<br>
The sol-gel techniques are well known processes, used for a variety of different<br>
commercial applications, ranging from optical and electrical coatings to improve the<br>
scratch resistance.<br>
US patent 5,337,747 by Frederic Neftel, January 7th, 1993, discloses an implantable<br>
device for estimating the level of glucose in the blood by the use of osmosis.<br>
The US Patent 5,337,747 is based on the use of two pressure sensors, each sensor<br>
measuring the pressure in a corresponding "chamber". This means that the signal of<br>
interest is the difference between the two sensors. This will significantly decrease both<br>
the sensitivity and accuracy of the measurement.<br><br>
The pressure sensors are based on a pressure sensor where the deflection of a pressure<br>
sensitive membrane is measured by the change in the electrical capacitance between this<br>
membrane (which doubles as an electrode) and a fixed electrode. This type of sensor<br>
excludes the use of a differential element as long as the medium where the measuring of<br>
 the pressure is conducted, is conductive (as in the present case where water is used).<br>
It should also be noted that the sensor element described in the US Patent 5,337,747<br>
would not work according to its intentions. This is caused by the fact that more than 99<br>
% of the capacitance measured will be caused by the mounting between the membrane<br>
(10) and the other electrode (12) which is fixed and is not changing with changing<br>
pressure in the chamber. Less than 1 % of the total capacitance will be modulated by the<br>
deflection of the pressure sensitive membrane.<br>
In the US Patent 5,337,747 it is stated that one of the osmotic membranes should be<br>
permeable for water, ions and lactic acid, but not for glucose. This should be obtained<br>
by designing pores with a diameter of between 0,6 and 0,74 rim. However, this model<br>
for membrane behaviour is over-simplified and does not take into account other<br>
important effects contributing to the transport properties of the membrane. A membrane<br>
with such a cut-off (pore diameter) will not avoid osmotic effects from the stated<br>
solutes. This is because both electrical and steric effects will impede and possibly<br>
totally stop the transport of solutes. This means that it is impossible to obtain an osmotic<br>
pressure from glucose only.<br>
US Patent 6,224,550, by one of the present inventors, May 1,2001, relies on<br>
maintaining a similar osmolality on both sides of an osmotic membrane. This is<br>
obtained by allowing water to flow freely through the membrane and thereby changing<br>
the volume (and thereby the concentration) of the "calibrated" fluid inside the sensor.<br>
One of the disadvantages with this design is the fact that a significant amount of water<br>
must be transported through the membrane when the osmolality in the body is changing.<br>
However, only limited fluxes are possible through such membranes, which means that a<br>
relatively large area of the osmotic membrane is needed. In addition, the time response<br>
will depend on the actual position of a piston, and as such, the sensor will also be non-<br>
linear.<br>
Another problem is the friction between the moving piston and the wall. To be able to<br>
move the piston, the pressure force must exceed the friction force. From measurements<br>
it is seen that even with a large cylinder radius, it is needed a high difference in osmotic<br>
pressure to move the piston, which is very unfavourable from the point of accuracy.<br>
A more fundamental problem with this sensor is the fact that to obtain a "calibrated"<br>
fluid, the small electrolytes must be allowed to pass through the membrane. As glucose<br>
and larger molecules are excluded from passing through the membrane, the "calibrated"<br>
fluid will always have to maintain a higher concentration of the electrolytes (chlorine,<br>
potassium, etc). The result is an unstable element, from which the electrolytes gradually<br>
will be drained out, and in the end the calibrated fluid will disappear.<br>
OSMOSIS<br>
The principle of the sensor according to the present invention is based on osmosis. In its<br>
simplest form, osmosis is the transport of a solvent across a semipermeable membrane<br>
caused by differences in the concentration of solutes on either side of the membrane.<br>
Osmosis is a process where certain kinds of molecules in a liquid are preferentially<br>
blocked by a "semipermeable" membrane. The solvent (in our case water) is diffusing<br>
through the membrane into the more concentrated solution, more so than in the opposite<br>
direction. The result is a combination of two effects. One is that an osmotic<br>
(hydrostatic) pressure is built up in the volume of higher concentration. The other is the<br>
reduction in the concentration difference caused by the increased volume of solvent.<br>
Ultimately, a dynamic equilibrium is reached, in which the increase in chemical<br>
potential caused by the osmotic pressure difference (D), equals the corresponding<br>
change caused by the difference in concentration (C). At osmotic equilibrium, the<br>
chemical potential of the solvent must equate the chemical potential of the pure solvent.<br>
The ratio between change in pressure versus change in concentration depends on the<br>
compliance of the volumes and can be changed (and optimised) by the design.<br>
Osmotic pressure is one example of a colligative property, that is a property which<br>
depends only on the number of solute molecules, and not on the nature of the molecules.<br>
For relatively small concentrations, as those observed in the body, the osmotic pressure<br>
is equal to the pressure that the solute molecules would exert given they were in a gas of<br>
the same concentration.<br><br>
Where V is the volume of solution containing one mole of solute. The constant i, is the<br>
"van't Hoff factor", which is a measure of the relative increase in amount of entities<br>
(particles) due to dissociation.<br>
The present invention can be utilised to monitor any changes within the in chemistry in<br>
vivo. The type of solutes and their concentration observed in vivo gives a tremendous<br>
amount of information regarding the physiology of the body, and its condition. By<br>
measuring the composition for instance in the interstitial fluid (ISF), a lot of information<br>
can be obtained regarding de-hydration of the body and different diseases. These are<br>
amongst others: diabetes, kidney function etc. Also normal variations for instance in<br>
lactate concentration caused by physical activity can be monitored.<br>
In addition to the substances mentioned above, which can change the osmolality in the<br>
body, one can also find substances by medication, which give an osmotic contribution<br>
in the body fluid. In this case, the present invention can be used to monitor the amount<br>
of medication.<br>
Measurement of glucose in ISF is becoming recognised as an alternative to measuring<br>
the glucose directly in the blood. The glucose measurement in blood is associated with<br>
several drawbacks. It needs a sample of blood, drawn from the body. Even though the<br>
equipment has become more sensitive, and therefore requires less blood, the process is<br>
associated with pain and the number of tests typically limited to less than 10 per day. It<br>
is also known that large variations in measured values can be caused by the<br>
measurement procedure.<br>
The present invention is concerned with a variety of parameters like de-hydration,<br>
lactic-acid, and amino-acids in addition to glucose.<br>
In examples of embodiments of the present invention the use of one pressure sensor of<br>
the differential type, which directly measure the difference between the two chambers,<br>
will increase the sensitivity and accuracy by order of magnitudes.<br>
hi examples of embodiments of the present invention, a piezo-resistive element, in<br>
which the sensing resistors are "buried" into the silicon, and do therefore not get into<br>
contact with the liquid in the reference volumes are used. The buried resistors can be<br>
part of a Wlieatstone bridge. <br>

GENERAL DESCRIPTION<br>
The total sensor consists of two main parts. The first part is the sensing apparatus,<br>
which is placed inside the human (or animal) body. The other part is the control unit,<br>
which receives the sensor signal, converts it to the concentration of the solute, with the<br>
possibility of storing and displaying the real-time as well as average values.<br>
The sensing apparatus consists of the following elements: The sensing device, a radio<br>
transmitter (possibly a transceiver) and an energy supply, which could be a battery or an<br>
antenna for magnetic induction (see fig. 6A and 6B).<br>
SENSING DEVICE<br>
In the present invention, the sensing device comprises the following elements. One or<br>
more differential pressure-transducers, each of which is able to directly measure the<br>
pressure difference between two liquid volumes hereafter called reference volumes.<br>
These reference volumes are internal to the osmotic sensor, and are confined by, in one<br>
end the differential pressure transducer, and in the other end the respective osmotic<br>
membranes.<br>
A change in the glucose concentration in vivo has two effects. One is the direct change<br>
in the osmolality of the ISF. The other is a change in fluid composition (without<br>
necessary changing the total concentration of osmotic active substances). Both these<br>
effects have to be measured, as the body will be inclined to maintain a constant<br>
osmolality by slowly adjusting the concentration of the electrolytes.<br>
Differential measurement<br>
Changes in the chemical composition in vivo is a combination of A) Direct changes in<br>
the osmolality of the fluid, which are directly reflected by the sensor. B) Changes in<br>
fluid composition (without changing the total concentration of osmotic active<br>
substances). The main difficulty when using osmotic techniques is to obtain an adequate<br>
specificity (the ability to distinguish between the different osmotic components).<br>
Fig. 1 illustrates an example of embodiment according to the present invention. A<br>
sensor housing 1 made in silicon comprises a sensor 2 which is a pressure transducer or<br>
a variable capasitor that will register a change in the pressure caused by a variable flux<br>
of water inn or out of the membrane and/or a change in volume hat activates the sensor<br>
2. A charged membrane 3 comprising both anion and cation charges are supported by a<br>
perforated support 4. A callibrated fluid 5 is present in the porous substance 6, where<br>
the osmolality is defined by the content of molecules. The fluid will normally be water<br>
while the solute is salt or for example glucose or other types of molecules. A normal<br>
condition is when the osmolality is equal on both sides of the membrane. When charged<br>
substances 8 are close to the membrane, two effects will arise. The first one is that the<br>
osmolality of the body fluid will increase which causes water to be forced out of the<br>
sensor which reduces the fluid volume in the sensor. The second effect is to change the<br>
electrical potential in the membrane due to the charges. This is illustrated with the<br>
circuit 7. A normal fluid condition provides a defined voltage over the membrane.<br>
When the ion concentration increases the voltage will change according to the negative<br>
or positive charges, and the detected difference and the osmolality changes will be<br>
proportional to the ion concentration in the fluid, and it will indicate if the registered<br>
osmolality is due to glucose or lactates.<br>
Figure 2 illustrates another embodiment of the present invention where there are<br>
arranged two membranes 2 and 4 on each side of the sensor housing 1. The membrane 2<br>
has a cut-off enabling diffusion of glucose or lactions 7 in a reference fluid 6, butt hat<br>
will cut off larger molecules. The membrane 4 has a cur-offthat gives an osmotic effect<br>
for glucose molecules 8, butt hat reduces or has no osmotic effect for lactions 7. The<br>
cavity above the sensor 5 provides two separate chambers filled with a porous material<br>
preferred to be an inert metal, ceramics or plastic that support the membranes from the<br>
side that faces the reference chambers. Above each membrane is arranged a stiff<br>
perforated plate 3 made of metal, ceramics or plastic.<br>
Figure 3 illustrates another embodiment of the present invention. The embodiment has<br>
the same elements as in the example illustrated in figure 2, but the area of the two<br>
membranes 2 and 4 are different.<br>
Figure 4 illustrates an example of arrangement of the present invention. A sensor<br>
housing 1 is machined from titan or siliconocide. In each end of the house, there are<br>
provided two half-spheres in porous metal or ceramics 4. Above each of these parts<br>
there are provided an unorganic membrane 2 and 3 with different cut-offs.<br>
There is provided a cavity 6 n the housing 1 for the electronic circuits 5 that transforms<br>
the signals from the pressure transducers 8 to digital signals transmitted to a receiver.<br>
The ports 7 provides communication between the pressure transducers and the reference<br>
fluids from each of the membranes 2 and 3.<br>
Figure 5 illustrates an example of embodiment of the present invention where the sensor<br>
do not provides a calibrated fluid as a reference, but two charged membranes A and B<br>
with different charges made of silicon, titan or another biocompatible material. When<br>
the ion concentration changes around the sensor, the potential between the membranes<br>
will be changed and will be proportional to the ion concentration of the body fluid.<br>
Figure 6A and 6B illustrates an arrangement of a power supply, an ASIC circuit and the<br>
reference chambers according to the present invention.<br>
The use of differential measurements is the clue to solve the problem with specificity.<br>
Differential measurements make it possible to measure the various diffusion rates<br>
(permeability) of the species that contributes to the osmotic pressure. By combining the<br>
measurements from different membranes we can therefore track the changes in<br>
concentration of the solute in question.<br>
An additional approach is to vary the displacement versus pressure for the different<br>
reference volumes (or alternatively the available flow area). This is best done by<br>
modifying the stiffness of the osmotic membranes as described below.<br>
Reference fluid<br>
The fluid inside the reference volumes, hereafter called reference fluid, is based on<br>
water, with added solutes. The type and amount of solutes is chosen to closely resemble<br>
the in vivo condition. (This fluid could for instance be Ringer Acetate). In addition to<br>
these low molecular weight electrolytes and molecules, a specific amount of a non<br>
harmful, non toxic, fully water soluble solute with a high molecular weight (&gt; 1000<br>
Dalton) is added. This is done to ensure that the hydrostatic pressure inside the<br>
reference chambers always is higher than in the surrounding fluid. In this way, the<br>
formation of gas bubbles is avoided, which could otherwise cause a serious fail-function<br>
of the sensor.<br>
Differential pressure transducer<br>
The use of differential pressure transducers is one of the main features of the present<br>
invention. This is done to; A) Compensate for changes in hydrostatic pressure (caused<br>
by external air pressure variations, as well as tension in muscles etc.). B) Increase the<br>
resolution of the sensing elements, as the membranes of the pressure transducers are<br>
only subjected to the difference between the two osmotic pressures. As these differences<br>
are small, highly sensitive elements are designed. This increased sensitivity is important<br>
also for improving the specificity of the sensor<br>
Osmotic membranes<br>
The semipermeable membranes are designed such that small molecules (
and ions to some extent will pass through the membrane. The concentration of these<br>
substances in the reference chambers will thereby to some extent adjust to the interstitial<br>
body fluid. However, the sensor can not rely on finding the ideal membranes. The clue<br>
is membranes that have different properties with respect to the different solutes<br>
encountered in vivo.<br>
Today there exist several techniques by which osmotic membranes can be custom-made<br>
with different properties. Examples of this are fore example "sol-gel techniques", micro<br>
perforation, etching and similar techniques giving predefined pore sizes in non-organic<br>
membranes. Alternatively organic membranes can be used. Thus it is possible to design<br>
sensors with two or more different membranes that give different responses to the<br>
different solutes in the interstitial liquid in the body. By varying only the pore size of<br>
the membrane in the range of the substance in question, but keeping the materials the<br>
same, the diffusion of the electrolytes is only slightly altered. By differential monitoring<br>
of the flux across the membranes one can therefore detect changes in the solute, which<br>
is monitored.<br>
Beside the specifically designed pore size, the membranes also posses other important<br>
properties. These includes<br>
• Preferably no (or only a small) thermal expansion miss-match with the silicon<br>
pressure sensor<br>
• Ease of bonding to the silicon pressure sensor<br>
• Easily defined geometrical properties as well as precisely adaptable displacement<br>
The mechanical displacement of the membrane defines accurately the amount of water<br>
that has to diffuse through the membrane to obtain a certain pressure in the reference<br>
volume. By reducing the displacement of the membrane, the response time of the<br>
element is reduced proportionally.<br>
One way of making the osmotic membranes is to make a two-layer structure. The first<br>
layer (or substrate) is used to provide the mechanical properties of the membrane, and<br>
can typically be made by micro-machining of silicon. This technique is well known in<br>
the industry. A sufficient porosity of the thin silicon membranes formed is obtained by<br>
anodic oxidation of the silicon. This process is documented in the literature by several<br>
authors.<br>
The "active" part of the membrane (where the osmotic properties are defined) is added<br>
as a thin film on top of the silicon substrate. This can either be a non-organic material,<br>
made for instance by a "Sol-gel" technique.<br>
To improve the time response the water permeability must be sufficiently high.<br>
Minimising the diffusion length and maximising the pore density in the membrane<br>
support structure obtain this.<br>
However, the sensor can easily be adapted to accept commercially available membranes<br>
of different types.<br>
Reference volume<br>
The design of the reference volumes is important to obtain a high accuracy. One<br>
important factor is to minimise concentration gradients in the reference volume caused<br>
by the transport of water (or solutes) across the membrane. This is done by ensuring that<br>
the depth of the reference chambers (normal to the semipermeable membrane) is small<br>
compared to the square root of the diffusivity times the wanted response time of the<br>
element.<br>
The reference chambers is formed in a material and with an external structure to<br>
minimise the volume displacement of the chambers when exposed to changes in<br>
hydrostatic pressure. This is important to minimise the amount of water transport<br>
through the membrane, which will increase the response time.<br>
The reference volume is designed such that gas-bubbles are not trapped inside re-entrant<br>
cavities. This is obtained by a combination of the geometrical shape and by the choice<br>
of materials (avoid hydrophobic materials).<br>
Filling of reference volume<br>
The reference volumes are filled with a suitable solute. One alternative is to join the<br>
sensor wafer and the membrane wafers while these are immersed in the actual solution.<br>
Another alternative is to fill the reference volume through a separate filling hole, which<br>
is sealed after the filling. These two filling alternatives is performed under low<br>
atmospheric pressure (given by vapour pressure of water) to minimise the amount of air<br>
in the reference chamber.<br>
When using a separate filling hole, the diameter of the filling hole has to be sufficient to<br>
avoid problems with surface tension induced pressures. The filling hole is plugged<br>
under liquid, and the system is designed to obtain a minimum of volume change during<br>
plugging, to avoid high pressure peeks.<br>
If the osmotic membranes have a sufficient permeability for the low-molecular solutes<br>
(ions), filling of solvent (and low molecular weight substances) can be obtained through<br>
the osmotic membrane. The last method requires that the high molecular weight<br>
materials be deposited into the chamber before the membranes are joined to the<br>
pressure transducer. The actual filling of the "solvent" could also be performed in the<br>
body, after implantation. This can be obtained by for instance sputtering onto one or<br>
both of the parts constituting the osmotic element, not on the bonding surfaces<br>
(sputtering through a mask or Lift-off) prior to bonding.<br>
When filling the solvent through membrane the vapour pressure inside the reference<br>
volume must be reduced compared to the external liquid (solvent) to facilitate the filling<br>
of the chamber. This is obtained by using the vapour pressure depressing effects caused<br>
by the addition of a solute in the reference volume (the high molecular weight material).<br>
Other materials<br>
The invention make it possible to use silicon microelectronics whereby the sensor can<br>
be made very small and be given numerous different geometrical shapes and can thus be<br>
implanted with minute surgical operations. But, the sensor can also be produced by<br>
conventional machining technology with the only difference that the geometrical shape<br>
and size will be different.<br>
Electrical read-out<br>
The electrical signal from the pressure transducer is transformed to make it suitable for<br>
wire-less transmission to an external receiver unit. Both the coding (protocol) and the<br>
frequency is chosen to provide data integrity, security and low power consumption.<br>
Such "radio" transmission systems do partly exist today, and are also under<br>
development. The energy can either be supplied internally from a battery, or by for<br>
instance magnetic induction.<br>
