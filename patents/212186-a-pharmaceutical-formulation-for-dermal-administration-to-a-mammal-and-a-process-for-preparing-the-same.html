				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td> <br><br>
The present invention relates to pharmaceutical formulations for dermal administration of therapeutic agents to an animal patient, pharmaceutical products containing the same and methods of treatment emp1oying such pharmaceutical formulations and products.<br>
In the treatment of localised disorders,  such as skin infections or the like, it has often been desirable to prescribe  therapeutic  agents  in  a  form that  has  a topical, or localised effect.  Topical formulations have been available in a variety of forms, including creams, ointments,  solutions,  lotions,   suspensions,  pas tes, emulsions, foams and the like. Water miscible creams have: generally been employed for moist or weeping lesions, whereas ointments have been generally chosen for dry, lichenified or scaly lesions or where a more occlusive effect has been required. Lotions have generally been useful when minimal  application to  a large or hair bearing area has been required or for the treatment of exudative lesions.<br>
It is important with any dosing regime, that accurate dosing is achieved and in the case of topical formulations substantially as hereinbefore described 11 is particularly important that patients follow the instructions carefully and thus avoid any adverse effects. For example, with such topical formulations a higher dose than recommended could easily be accidentally achieved, typically due to difficulties of knowing the precise amount of formulation necessary for application.<br>
Suitable quantities of topical formulations hitherto prescribed for specific areas of the body have been as follows:<br><br><br>
The above amounts have usually been suitable for an adult for twice daily application for one week. However, the above recommendations have not been applicable for all topical formulations and a number of categories of topical formulations require specialised dosing regimes. For example, the above recommendations have not been applicable for corticosteroid preparations. More particularly, for potent corticosteroid formulations, more care has been required for application as absorption through the skin can cause severe pituitary-adrenal-axis suppression and Gushing's syndrome, both of which depend on the area of the body treated and the duration of the treatment. Corticosteroid preparations have, therefore, normally been applied once or twice daily (it has not been necessary to apply them more frequently) and suitable quantities hitherto prescribed for specific areas of the body have been as follows:<br><br><br>
Furthermore, treatment of severe atopic eczema on the limbs or body (or a flare-up of mild to moderate eczema) has often required still further consideration. For example, treatment has in some cases required application of a potent or moderately potent corticosteroid for the first one to two weeks, followed by a weaker preparation as the condition improves; an emollient has also been used.<br>
It will be appreciated from the above that considerable care is required in following a dosing regime for topical formulations and a particular consideration that should be taken into account is the maximum dosage that can be tolerated for any therapeutic agent during a treatment course. For example, the following are specific examples of prior art topical formulations where specific dosing regimes, and in particular maximum dosages, have been instructed.  Examples are:<br>
Doxepin Hydrochloride, recommended to be applied thinly three to four times daily, typically with a maximum 3g administration per application, a typical daily maximum administration of 12g and suitably coverage should be less than about 10% of body surface;<br><br>
V<br>
Clobetasol Propionate, recommended to be applied thinly one to two times daily for up to four weeks, typically with a maxitmum administration of about 5 0g of a 0-05% preparation per week; and<br>
Diflucortolone Valerate, recommended to be applied one to two times daily for up to four weeks (0. 1 % preparation) or two weeks (0.3% preparation), with typically a maximum administration of about 6 0g of a 0.3% preparation per week.<br>
In particular, it has been seen to be especielly important for topical formulations of Calcipotriol, that: the maximum dosage should be monitored. For example, there has been seen to be a risk of hypercalcemia if the recommended maximum weekly dose of Calcipotriol has been exceeded. Unfortunately/ the above has not always been clearly explained in patient information provided with topical formulations of Calcipotriol. For example topical formulation of Calcipotriol available under t he trade mark Dovonex have advised liberal applicat ion despite the above described potential for hypercalcaemia and as can be appreciated, therefore, the above can be problematic. The recommended dosing regime for a topical formulation of Calcipotriol; however, has been to apply once or twice daily with a maximum weekly dose of lOOg. For patients over six years the formulation should be applied twice daily; for patients from six to twelve years; a maximum weekly dose of 50g; and for pal i enr L; over twelve years, a maximum weekly dose of 75g.<br>
To alleviate problems encountered with treatment reglnK-e; where i t has been important to bbserve a maximum doscage of a therapeutic agent for dermal administration, it would be beneficial to be able to provide means for substantially accurately dermally administering such a therapeutic agent to a patient, Such acc\ii ate administration  should  obviate  the  detrimental  o i de<br><br>
effects that have hitherto been observed when maximum dosages have been exceeded.<br>
A difficulty that has, in the past, been encountered when trying  to  achieve  the  above  described  accurate administration, has been where a therapeutic agent has been applied to the skin in a topical formulation, and it has. often been a problem for a patient to be able to measure  out  a  precise  amount  of  such  a  topical formulation.     It  has,   therefore,  been  especi ally difficult to ensure that the patient has received an accurate dosing of the therapeutic agent-  One method of. metering, or dosing, the amount of a therapeutic agent applied to a patient's skin in such a topical formulation has  been  for  a  patient  to  squeeze  such  a  topical formulation from a dispenser, such as a tube, along an index finger starting at the fingertip down to the first joint and the amount of therapeutic agent thus to be<br>
	administered has been known as the fingertip unit {FTU) .<br>
One FTU generally approximates to about 5 0 Omg of<br>
topical formulation and is generally sufficient to cover<br>
an area that is twice that of a flat adult hand. Such<br>
administration has not, however, hitherto achieved<br>
accurate dosing, and in particular the above is<br>
problematic in that the FTU is only an approximate unit<br>
and its magnitude varies from patient to patient,<br>
	It has also been known to deliver therapeutic agents<br>
transdermally by applying to the skin of a patient an<br>
adhesive patch containing a therapeutic agent. Such<br>
patches have typically further included a rate moderating<br>
membrane, an adhe s ive, a 1 iner and a backing ma t e r i a 1 .<br>
The adhesive has often required special formulation to<br>
ensure compatibility with the other components of such<br>
patches and this type of formulation has often increased<br>
the cost of such patches. Furthermore, not all<br>
therapeutic agents are suitable for inclusion in such<br>
patches (typically therapeutic agents having a localised<br><br>
therapeutic effect have not hitherto been employed in such patches) and the use of such patches has not, therefore, offered a ' possible route of dermal administration for such therapeutic agents.<br>
Such patches have also been referred to in the pharmaceutical field as "medicinal plasters". For example, US4765986 describes a medicinal plaster which comprises a drug present in a carrier substance and the carrier substance is affixed to a porous and flexible synthetic material<br>
US5863941 is also concerned with dermal administration of therapeutic agents and in particular describes a method of treating pathological symptoms of the inner ear. More particularly, US5863941 describes the use of a carrier substance and a therapeutic agent, the latter comprising a local anaesthetic present in an amount of about 0.5 to 40% by weight of the carrier substance. The carrier substance and therapeutic agent described in US5863 941 for use in the treatment of the inner ear, may take the form described in US4765986<br>
For dermal administration of therapeutic agents suitable for provision in liquid form, EP0375763B describes an applicator device for dosing a liquid, such as a medicinal solution, onto the skin of a patient. The device described by EP0375763B includes a micrometric screw dosing mechanism which allows variation of the internal cavity thereof. An applicator device of the type described in EP0375763B, however, is of course, only suitable for use with therapeutic agents that can be provided in solution-<br>
The present invention is an improvement the prior art and provides pharmaceutical formulations suitable for dermally administering one or more therapeutic agents to an animal patient, pharmaceutical products containing the<br><br>
same, processes of preparing such pharmaceutical formulations and products, and methods of treating an animal patient employing such pharmaceutical formulations and products. In particular, the present invention provides pharmaceutical formulations, pharmaceutical products containing the same, processes of preparing such formulations and products, and methods of treatment, which each allow accurate dosing of one or more therapeutic agents to the skin of an animal .patient.<br>

There is provided by the present invention, therefore, a process  of  preparing  a  pharmaceutical  f ormulation, containing a unit dose of at least one therapeutic agent., which formulation is for dermal administration to a n animal patient, which process comprises:<br>
' (a) admixing the at least one therapeutic agent with a carrier medium therefor so as to obtain a mixture thereof; and<br>
(b) shaping at least a portion of the mixture obtained by step (a) , so as to obtain said pharmaceutical formulation.<br><br>
More particularly; there is provided by the present invention/ a process of preparing a pharmaceutical formulation for effecting dermal administration of at least one therapeutic agent suitable for dermal administration to an animal patient/ which pharmaceutical formulation contains a unit dose of the at least one therapeutic agent, which process comprises:<br>
(a)	admixing the at least one therapeutic agent with a carrier medium therefor so as to obtain a mixture thereof; and<br>
(b)	shaping at least a portion of the mixture obtained by step (a) , which shaping comprises tableting at least a portion of the mixture obtained by step (a) so as to provide a pharmaceutical formulation containing a un:i t dose of the at least one therapeutic agent.<br>
There is also provided by a first aspect of the present invention a process of preparing a pharmaceutical formulation for effecting dermal administration of at: least one  therapeutic agent suitable for dermal administration to an animal patient, the pharmaceutical formulation typically having a substantially solid dosage form at ambient temperature and having a softening point substantially as hereinafter described in greater detail of not higher than skin temperature of an animal patient, which pharmaceutical formulation contains a unit dose of: the at least one therapeutic agent, which process comprises:<br>
(a) admixing the at least one therapeutic agent: with a major proportion of a carrier medium therefor so as to obtain a mixture thereof, the carrier medium having a softening point not higher than skin temperature of an animal patient; and<br><br>
(b) shaping at least a portion of the mixture obtained by step (a) at a temperature below the softening point of the carrier medium, to form a substantially solid form (typically a substantially solid dosage form) having a softening point of not higher than skin temperature of an animal patient and containing a unit dose of the at least one therapeutic agentâ¢<br>
Shaping a mixture of the at least one therapeutic agent and  carrier  medium  substantially  as  hereinbefore described  typically  comprises  tableting  at  least  a. portion  of  the  mixture  obtained  by  any  step  (a) substantially as hereinbefore described so as to provide a pharmaceutical formulation containing a unit dose of the therapeutic agent. Typically "tableting" as described herein can comprise introducing, at least a portion of a mixture of the at least one therapeutic agent and a carrier  medium  prepared  according  to  the  present invention, into a tableting press and compressing the introduced mixture to yield a substantially solid form, typically a substantially solid dosage form having a size and configuration suitable for dermally administering the at least one therapeutic agent substantially as herein described  to  an  animal  patient.    Indeed,  tablets containing therapeutic agents, as already forming part of the state of the art, are a common form of medicinal preparation for oral delivery and are made by compression of a mixture of finely divided ingredients and are known to be advantageous in view of their relative precision and reproducibility of dose,  their desirable handling properties and generally relatively inexpensive processes :  of  manufacture.    Tablets  according  to  the present invention for effecting dermal administration of a unit dose of at least one therapeutic agent to an animal patient do not, however, form part of the  state of the<br><br>
art but do similarly possess the advantages associated with known tablets for oral administration substantially as hereinbefore described.<br>
A process  of preparing a  pharmaceutical  formulation according to the present invention may further comprise cooling at least a portion of a mixture of the at least one  therapeutic  agent  and  carrier  medium  therefor prepared substantially as hereinbefore described; which cooling can improve handling properties of the mixture and may also increase the speed of tableting as carried out according to the present invention. Suitably cooling may be carried out prior to and/or during shaping of a mixture of the at least one therapeutic agent and a carrier medium therefor as prepared according to the present   invention   substantially   as   hereinbefore described-   Preferably, the mixture can be cooled to a temperature of not more than about 15Â°C, advantageously not more than about 10Â°C, for example, not more than about 0Â°C, prior to, and/or during shaping substantially as hereinbefore described.<br>
Suitably, cooling as carried out in a process according to the present invention may be effected at least in part by using a cooled tableting press. Advantageously, a mixture of the at least one therapeutic agent and carrier medium therefor can also be cooled prior to introduction thereof into such a tableting press.<br>
In a preferred process according to the first aspect of the present invention there is provided a process of preparing a pharmaceutical formulation for effecting dermal administration of at least one therapeutic agent suitable for dermal administration to an animal patient, the pharmaceutical formulation containing a unit dose of the at least one therapeutic agent and having a substantially solid dosage form at ambient temperature and being softenable, on application thereof to an area of skin of an animal patient, to a consistency that can<br><br>
be absorbed by the area of skin so as to effect administration of the unit dose of the therapeutic agent to the animal patient, which process comprises, in the order specified, the steps of:<br>
(a)	admixing at least' one therapeutic agent suitable for dermal administration to an animal patient and at least one ingredient suitable for providing a carrier medium therefor so as to obtain a mixture thereof;<br>
(b)	cooling (preferably at a temperature of less than about 10Â°C, preferably less than about 0Â°C) the mixture obtained by step  (a)  so as to effect substantial solidification thereof; and<br>
(c)	shaping at least a portion of the substantially<br>
solidified mixture obtained by step (b) to<br>
provide a substantially solid form (typically a<br>
substantially solid dosage form) of a<br>
pharmaceutical formulation according to the<br>
first aspect of the present invention.<br>
Typically a process according to the first aspect of the present invention further comprises a step of reducing particle size (such as by granulating, prilling or the like) prior to shaping to a substantially solid dosage form. Suitably the substantially solidified mixture obtained by step (b) above, can be granulated to provide a plurality of particles having a particle size in the range of 100 to 1000 microns.<br>
It may be preferred that a pharmaceutical formulation as provided by the present invention is substantially free of preservatives substantially as hereinafter described in greater detail and in such cases it is preferred that a process according to the present invention is carried out under aseptic conditions.<br><br>
It may' also be preferred that a pharmaceutical formulation as provided by the present invention is substantially free of antioxidants substantially as hereinafter described in greater detail and in such cases it is preferred that, where a process according to the present invention includes packaging of the pharmaceutical formulation, at least such packaging is carried out in a substantially inert atmosphere, such as nitrogen or the like.<br>
There is also provided by the present invention a pharmaceutical formulation comprising a "unit dose of at least one therapeutic agent and a carrier medium therefor, which pharmaceutical formulation is capable of effecting dermal administration of the unit dose of the at least one therapeutic agent to an animal patient.<br>
According to the above described first aspect of the present invention there is further provided a pharmaceutical formulation for effecting dermal administration of at least one therapeutic agent suitable for dermal administration to an animal patient, which pharmaceutical formulation has a substantially solid dosage form at ambient temperature and has a softening point (substantially as hereinafter described in greater detail) of not higher than skin temperature of an animal patient, and contains a unit dose of at least one therapeutic agent suitable for dermal administration to an animal patient.<br>
More particularly, according to the above described first aspect of the present invention there is provided a pharmaceutical formulation for effecting dermal administration of at least one therapeutic agent suitable for dermal administration to an animal patient, which formulation has a subs t ant i ally solid dosage form at ambient temperature and comprises a unit dose of the at<br><br>
least one therapeutic agent in admixture with a carrier medium therefor, the formulation being characterised by the solid dosage form being softenable on application thereof to an area of skin of an animal patient, whereby following application to the area of skin the solid dosage form is softened to a consistency that can be substantially absorbed by the area of skin so as to effect administration of the unit dose of the therapeutic agent to the animal patient.<br>
Even more particularly, there is provided by the above described first aspect of the present invention a pharmaceutical formulation for effecting dermal administration of at least one therapeutic agent suitable for dermal administration to an animal patient, which formulation has a substantially solid dosage form at ambient temperature and comprises a unit dose of the at: least one therapeutic agent in admixture with a carrier medium therefor, the formulation being characterised by the substantially solid dosage form being softenable on application thereof to an area of skin of an animal patient, whereby following application to the area of skin the solid dosage form is softened to a consistency that can be substantially completely absorbed by the area of skin so as to effect substantially complet e administration of the unit dose of the therapeutic agent to the animal patient.<br>
Typically, a substantially solid dosage form at ambient temperature of a pharmaceutical formulation according to the first aspect of the present invention is provided in the form of a tablet substantially as hereinbefore described and typically is prepared substantially as hereinbefore described. Alternatively, a substantially solid dosage form of a pharmaceutical formulation according to the first aspect of the present invention may be provided in the form of a rolled preparation, for example, a pill or the like.<br><br>
It may be generally preferred according to the first aspect of the present invention that the carrier medium, or more particularly the substantially solid dosage form, is converted to a spreading consistency substantially as hereinafter described in greater detail at a temperature that is above ambient temperature but not higher than skin  temperature  of  an  animal  patient  (hereinafter described as the spreading point) ,  In this case, it may also be generally preferred that the above described shaping step of a process according to first aspect of the present invention is carried out at a temperature below the spreading point of either the carrier medium cr the substantially solid dosage form.<br>
Typically, it is preferred the carrier medium and more particularly the substantially solid dosage form, of a pharmaceutical formulation according to the first aspect of the present invention may soften, and advantageously may  be  converted  to  a  spreading  consistency,  at  a temperature in the range of 30 to 37Â°C.   In this way, substantially as hereinbefore described the f ormulation can soften on application thereof to an area of skin of an animal patient,  whereby following application the substantially solid dosage form of the formulation is softened, to a consistency that  can be  substantially completely absorbed by the area of skin so as to effect substantially complete administration of the unit dose of the therapeutic agent to the animal patient.<br>
It is particularly preferred that a pharmaceutical formulation according to the above described first aspect of the present invention has a substantially solid dosage form at ambient t-emperature that can be softened to a consistency that can be substantially (preferably substantially completely) absorbed by the area of skin of the animal patient, so as to effect substantial administration (preferably substantially complete) of the<br><br>

It may also be preferred that pharmaceutical formulations according to the present invention may be substantially free of antioxidants of the type generally included in formulations for dermal administration, or at least may include such antioxidants in amounts less than generally required   in   formulations   intended   for   dermal administration, or at least may include such antioxidants in amounts that generally do not provoke  substantial allergic reactions in susceptible patients substantially as hereinafter described.   Such antioxidants generally employed .  in   formulations   intended   for   dermal administration are  generally present  to prevent  fats present in such formulations becoming rancid,  may bo useful in general storage and are primarily present to prevent  in  use  oxidation  following  opening.    Such ant i oxi dant s ' may  not  be  r equ i r e d  by  t he  p r e s e. n t invention, or at least required to a lesser extent than employed in prior art formulations, or more particularly may be employed at concentrations that do not generally provoke substantial  allergic reactions  in  susceptible patients, due to the unit dosing onto the skin that can be achieved by the present invention.   The use of such antioxidants can, -in some patients, be detrimental, in provoking allergic reactions in susceptible patients and the present invention may be advantageous in obviati ng such  allergic   reactions   in  susceptible   patients. Antioxidants that have been associated with allergic reactions  include  butylated  hydroxyanisole,  butylated hydroxytoluene  and  the  1 ike,  and  are  known  t o  be available in prior art  topical fo3rmulations,  such as those formulations available londer any of the trade marks Imuderm, Siopel and the like.<br><br>
The term softening point" as used herein refers to a temperature at which a substantially solid dosage form as employed in a pharmaceutical formulation according to the first aspect of the present invention as hereinbefore described starts to soften to a consistency that can be absorbed by the skin of a patient so as to administer a unit dose of a therapeutic agent present in the formulation to the patient.<br>
The "softening point" of a substantially solid dosage form of a pharmaceutical formulation according to the first aspect of the present invention substantially as hereinbefore described can be determined visibly as the temperature at which the substantially solid dosage form starts to soften to a consistency that can be absorbed by the skin of a patient and as such can advantageously be substantially completely absorbed by the skin of the patient so as to leave substantially no undesirable residue on the skin of a patient.<br>
Alternatively, the "softening point" of a substantially solid dosage form of a pharmaceutical formulation according to the first aspect of the present invention substantially as hereinbefore described can be determined using a TA-XT2 texture analyser, suitably equipped with a 5 kg load cell. The equipment is enclosed in a" temperature controlled chamber (capable of operating in the region of -60Â°C to 200Â°C) . A tablet or other substantially solid dosage form according to the present invention may be enclosed in the chamber at the specified temperature for a time of at least 10 minutes. A 3 mm flat faced probe is pushed into the tablet or other substantially solid dosage form according to the present invention for a distance of 1 mm at a speed of 0,1 mm.sec-1.<br>
Measurements can be repeated at temperature increments of 1Â°C and/ at the temperature at which the peak force of<br><br>
resistance recorded (as measured by Texture Exceed software) falls to below 50% of that for a "solid" tablet or other substantially solid dosage form according to the present invention, the tablet or other dosage form is deemed to have "softened" .<br>
The term "spreading point" as used herein in relation to a pharmaceutical formulation according to either the first or second aspect of the present invention refers to a temperature at which the formulation has a "spreading" consistency, for example, the formulation may flow under its own weight or at least can be spread upon the skin of an animal patient, for example, using finger pressure. That mobility of a formulation having a spreading consistency may promote the absorption of a therapeutic agent into the skin by allowing movement of the therapeutic agent towards the skin, for example, by diffusion. The spreading point of a preparation may be measured using the TA-XT2 texture analyser mentioned above in relation to measurement of softening point and with this analyser the spreading point of a formulation is the temperature at which outward flow of the formulation is first observed on advance of the flat faced probe into the preparation.<br>
The term "unit dose" means a formulation suitable for single administration which contains an effective amount of an agent to be administered, for example, a therapeutically active agent or a cosmetic agent.<br>
The formulations of the present invention can be packaged in a so-called blister pack. Blister packs are well known in the packaging industry and are widely used for the packaging of pharmaceutical unit dosage forms.  Blister packs generally consist of a sheet of relatively stiff material covered with a foil of a preferably transparent plastic material. During the packaging process recesses are formed in the plastic foil* The recesses have the<br><br>
size and shape of the formulations to be packed.  The formulations of the present invention can be placed in the recesses and the sheet of relatively stiff material I3 sealed against the plastic foil at the face of the foil which is opposite from the direction in which the recesses were formed. As a result, the formulations are sealed in the recesses between the plastic foil and the sheet. Preferably the strength of the sheet is such that the formulation can be removed from the blister pack by manually applying pressure on the recesses whereby an opening is formed in the sheet at the place of the recess, without affecting the integrity of the formulation.  In other embodiments, the foil can be peeled away.  The formulations of the present invention can then be removed via said opening.<br>
It may be desirable to provide a memory aid on the blister-pack,e.g., in the form of numbers corresponding with the days of the regimen which the formulations so specified should be applied- Another example of such a memory aid is a calendar printed on the card, e.g,, as follows "First Week, Monday, Tuesday, etc.. Second Week, Monday, Tuesday," etc. Other variations of memory aids will be readily apparent. A "daily dose" can be a single formulation or several formulations to be applied on a given day.<br>
The formulations of the present invention are preferably in solid form during the final manufacturing step and during packaging, and preferably at the time of administration.<br>
