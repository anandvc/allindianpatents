				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a crosslinked polyester copolymer, to a composition that can be used to produce the polyester, to a process for producing the composition and the crosslinked polyester copolymer.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Polyesters are widely used to manufacture textile fibers, containers, and packaging materials. Polyesters can be manufactured by combining a glycol, such as ethylene glycol, and a carbonyl compound, such as dimethyl terephthalate (DMT) or terephthalic acid (TPA). In the DMT route, DMT reacts with the glycol to form a bis-glycolate ester of terephthalate ("monomer") in an ester exchanger column. The monomer is then polymerized by condensation reactions in one or two prepolymerizers and then a final polymerizer or finisher.<br>
In the TPA route, TPA is combined with the glycol to form a slurry at 60°C to 100 °C followed by injecting the slurry into an esterifier. A linear oligomer with a degree of polymerization 5 to 10 is formed in one or two esterifiers at temperatures from 240°C to 290°C. The oligomer is polymerized in one or two prepolymerizers and then in a final polymerizer at temperatures from 250°C to 300°C. Water is a byproduct of the TPA esterification and polycondensation process.<br>
A problem associated with polyester fibers is their tendency to pill. Pilling is a defect in fabric caused when fibers are rubbed or pulled out of yarns and entangled with intact fibers, forming soft, fuzzy balls on the fabric surface. One of the most common commercial practices to produce pilling resistant fibers is to make lower molecular weight polyester. Unfortunately, spinning is very difficult or impossible with lower molecular weight polyester fibers. A temporary crosslinker or brancher can be used to increase molecular weight and polymer strength for better spinning performance. After spinning, the temporary crosslinks or branches hydrolyze in water. Tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) has been used commercially in DMT process to produce pilling resistance fibers. TPA process,<br><br>
however, has byproduct water, TEOS forms rocks or sands in the recycle glycol<br>
of TPA process.<br>
The dilemma is mat the temporary crosslmker or brancher must hydrolyze<br>
after spinning, but it must not hydrolyze in TPA polymerization process where<br>
mere is water. US patent 6,407,194 discloses a temporary crosslinker 3-<br>
Glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane (QTMS) to improve the pilling resistant of<br>
polyester fibers, which does not form solids in the TPA process. The spinning<br>
performance of polyester containing GTMS, however, is not as good as the<br>
polyester containing TEOS, because GTMS forms permanent crosslinks or<br>
branches due to the hydrophilic epoxy group hi addition to the temporary<br>
crosslinks or branches, resulting hi excessive crosslinks or branches hi the<br>
polyester. According to the invention, GTMS is merely dissolved in the glycol<br>
solution befpre injection, most methanol byproduct from GTMS emits hi the TPA<br>
polymerization process<br>
Most new polyester plants built hi the world are based on the newer TPA<br>
process. Therefore, mere is an increasing need to develop a polyester polymer<br>
having lower molecular weight that is crosslinked with a temporary crossUnker to<br>
increase molecular weight for spuming, which does not form solids hi TPA<br>
process.<br>
An additional consideration for producing polyester polymers is the rate of<br>
crystallization of partially oriented yarn (POY) during spuming. Normal spinning<br>
speeds are typically in the order of 3000-3500 m/min for POY. At higher<br>
spinning speeds, such as 4000-5000 m/min, crystallization of the POY can occur<br>
too fast, resulting hi low orientation hi fibers and deteriorates physical properties<br>
such as tenacity, elongation, and shrinkage. Further, the draw texturing speed of<br>
POY is normally about 900 m/min. Higher draw texturing speed such as 1000<br>
m/min requires POY with lower crystallization.<br>
Also, for container and packaging materials, polyethylene terephthalate<br>
(PET) are often modified with a comonomer such as isophthalic acid (EPA) and<br>
diethylene glycol (DEG) to reduce the crystallization rate during injection or<br>
extrusion blow molding. However, the resulting products have lower strength due<br>
to these additives.<br>
Normal PET fibers require disperse dye at temperature 120 °C to 140 °C<br>
under high pressure. PET copolymer containing additives such as polyethylene<br>
glycol can be dyed at temperature 100 °C or lower under atmospheric pressure,<br>
but its melt strength is low and spinning is more difficult. PET copolymer<br>
containing lPA 15% to 40% by mole has been commercially produced for binder<br>
fibers, tills copolymer can be difficult to spin because me melt strength is low.<br>
Accordingly, mere is a desire to decrease the crystallization rate of the<br>
polyester polymer during sphining without adversely altering the physical<br>
properties of the polyester polymer fiber; to develop a polyester composition and<br>
process suitable for injection and extrusion blow molding for container and<br>
packaging materials, which has low rate of crystallization, good heat resistance,<br>
high strength and clarity; and to develop a polyester copolymer with higher melt<br>
strength for fiber products such as binder fibers, biodegradable fibers,<br>
atmospherically dyeable fibers.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention comprises a glycol-organosilane composition that<br>
comprises or is produced by combining (a) a glycol and (b) an organosilane<br>
comprising ^£»pCnZp» where D is a halogen, a hydrogen, a hydroxyl, or a<br>
hydrocarbon oxygen group; X is a hydrocarbon or a hydrocarbon oxygen group; Z<br>

to about 3; and p is 1 to 20. This composition is preferably substantially soluble<br>
in glycol and water.<br>
The invention also comprises a crosslinked polyester copolymer<br>
composition and a process to produce the composition. The composition<br>
comprises repeat units derived from (a) a carbonyl compound or its oligomer, (b)<br>
a glycol, (c) a crosslinker, and (d) optionally a comonomer. A preferred process<br>
for producing the polyester copolymer comprises contacting a crosslinker, and<br>
optionally a comonomer, with a polymerization mixture comprising or consisting<br>
essentially of a glycol and either a carbonyl compound or its oligomer. The<br>
process can be used for increasing the rate of polymerization, for increasing the<br>
pill resistance or strength of a polyester copolymer, or for decreasing the<br>
crystalliiatiori rate during object forming process such as spuming of fibers or<br>
• injection and extrusion blow Molding and stretching of containers and packaging<br>
materials.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The terms "crosslinked polyester polymer" and "crosslinked polyester<br>
copolymer" are alternatively used herein referring polyester polymer containing<br>
temporary or permanent crosslinker or brancher, with or without a comonoraer.<br>
The term "temporary crosslinker" herein refers to a composition that<br>
temporary crosslinks or branches polyester molecules, and thereby increases the<br>
molecular weight of the polyester polymer and melt viscosity. The bonds of the<br>
branches or crosslinks (Si-6) formed by the crosslinker can be broken down after<br>
spuming by hydrolysis in water, moisture, alcohol, a weak acid, or a weak base.<br>
The term "permanent crosslinker" herein refers to a composition that<br>
permanently crosslinks or branches polyester molecules. The bonds of the<br>
crosslink an1^ branches d,P not break down in water, an alcohol, a weak acid, or a<br>
weak base.<br>
The term "glycol-organosilane composition" and "glycol-organosilane" as<br>
used herein refers to a product produced from a glycol and an organosilane,<br>
preferably ft is a product produced by partially reacting the organosilane with the<br>
glycol. By partially reacting or reacted, it is meant that about 20% to about 99%,<br>
preferably 50% to 95%, even more preferably 60% to 90%, by mole, of all<br>
reactive functional groups hi the organosilane molecule that can react with a<br>
glycol are reacted with the glycol. The term "reactive functional groups" refers to<br>
those functional groups that can react with a glycol. The term "reactive functional<br>
groups" herein can also refer to those functional groups that can react with an<br>
alcohol, a carbonyl compound, an acid or base as disclosed below.<br>
Wishing not to be bound by theory, ft is believed that, if the extent of<br>

cannot be dissolved hi water unless the Z is a hydrophilic group and that if the<br>
extent of reaction is too high (i.e., more men 99%), there can be some undesirable<br>
side reactions. The extent of the reaction can be determined by any suitable<br>
means known to one skilled in the art, such as by chemical analysis of functional<br>
groups or by weighing the byproduct separated by a suitable means such as<br>
distillation or filtration.<br>

can react with other compounds or functional groups such as an alcohol, water, an<br>
acid, a base, or a carbonyl compound. Example of reactive hydrophobic groups<br>
include, but are not limit to, a halogen, an ester, a ketone group, an aldehyde, a<br>
polyoxyalkyl group, or a mercaptan. As a halogen, it can be fluorine, chlorine,<br>

having combinations of 3 or more carbonyl and hydroxyl groups. Examples of<br>
the second crosslinkers include, but are not limited to, trimellitic anhydride, 1,2,4-<br>
benzenetricarboxylic acid, ester of 1^,4-benzenetricarboxylic acid, 1,3,5-<br>
benzenetricarboxylic acid, ester of 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid, pyromellitic<br>
dianhydride, trimethylolpropane, l,l,l-tris(hydroxymethyl)ethane,<br>
pentaerythritol, tartaric acid, citric acid, gallic acid, pyrogallol, glycol mixture<br>
thereof; and combinations of two of more thereof. Preferably the crosslinker is a<br>
carbonyl compound containing 3 carboxyl groups, such as trimellitic acid or its<br>
anhydride or its grycol ester, trimesic acid or its glycol ester.<br>
The preferred comonomer is a dicarboxylic compound other than<br>
terephmalic acid or its ester or its oligomer, a diol compound other than said<br>
alkylene glycol; or a carbonyl alcohol containing one carboxyl group and one<br>
hydroxyl group. Illustrative examples of the comonomers include, but are] not<br>
limited to, isophthalic acid, phmalic acid, cyclohexane dicarboxylic acid, 1,2-<br>
cyclohexanedicarboxylic anhydride, naphthalenedicarboxylic acid, oxalic acid,<br>
malonic acid, succinic acid, glutaric acid, adipic acid, sebacic acid, maleic acid,<br>
fumaric acid, maleic anhydride, dimethyl phthalate, dimethyl isophthalate,<br>
dimethyl naphthalenedicarboxylate, dhnethyl cyclohexane dicarboxylate,<br>
dhnethyl glutarate, dimethyl adipate, diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol,<br>
polyethylene grycol, polypropylene glycol, polyoxyethylene glycol,<br>
polyoxyp'fdyierie glycol, bolyoxybutylene grycol, 1,4-cyclohexanedimethanoi,<br>
neopentyl glycol, lactic acid, 2-hydroxybenzoic acid, 4-hydroxybenzoic acid,<br>
mandelic acid, glycol mixture thereof, and combinations of two or more thereof.<br>
The polyester copolymer can contain, by weight, repeat units derived from<br>
the comonomer about 0.1% to about 50%; the crosslinker about SO ppm (parts per<br>
million) to about 5,000 ppm, preferably 200 to 2,000 ppm. The rest of the repeat<br>
- 10 -<br>
units are derived from the carbonyl compound and the alkylene glycol. Low level<br>
of crosslinks or branches is preferred. If the concentration of crosslinker is too<br>
high (i.e., more then 5,000 ppm of polymer weight), excessive crosslink may<br>
form, which adversely affect polyester properties.<br>
The first crosslinker is also referred to as temporary crosslinker while the<br>
second crosslinker is also referred to as permanent crosslinker. A polyester<br>
polymer comprising repeat unit derived, or is produced from, the first crosslinker<br>
is generally referred to as a temporarily crosslinked polyester copolymer while<br>
that produced from the second crosslinker is referred to as permanently<br>
crosslinked polyester copolymer.<br>
I have unexpectedly found that the permanently crosslinked polyester<br>
copolymer containing a comonomer described above can simultaneously increase<br>
the rate of polymerization, reduce the rate of crystallization, and increase the melt<br>
strength during an object forming process such as spuming of fibers and injection,<br>
extrusion or stretching of containers and packaging materials. I also found that<br>
permanently crosslinked polyester copolymer containing a comonomer described<br>
above can simultaneously increase the rate of polymerization, improve the<br>
dyeability and nteft strenglfy therefore improving spinning performance of fibers.<br>
For applications such as containers and packaging materials, a<br>
permanently crosslinked polyester copolymer can increase the rate of,<br>
polymerization, reduce the rate of crystallization, increase the melt strength during<br>
object forming process such as stretching, injection, extrusion and blow molding,<br>
and improve the heat resistance and clarity of the finished products. The<br>
comonomer can be about 0.1% to about 10%, preferably about 0.3% to about 3%,<br>
based on polymer weight<br>
For applications such as atmospherically dyeable fibers, a permanently<br>
crosslinked polyester copolymer can increase the rate of polymerization, increase<br>
the melt strength, improve spuming and dyeability; the comonomer can be about<br>
1% to about 20%, preferably about 3% to about 10%, based on polymer weight.<br>
For applications such as binder fibers and biodegradable fibers, a permanently<br>
crosslinked polyester polymer can increase the rate of polymerization, increase<br>
tiie melt strength and improve spinning; the comonomer can be about 5% to about<br>
50%, preferably about 15% to about 40%, based on polymer weight.<br>
The crosglinked polyester copolymer can also comprise or consist<br>
essentially pf repeat units derived from a carbonyl compound, a glycol, and a<br>
glycol-organosilane as a first crosslinker. The organosilane DmSiX of the<br>
glycol-organosilane composition can be in the range from about 0.02% to about<br>
3%, preferably about 0.06% to about 1%, most preferably from about 0.1% to<br>
about 0.5%, based on me weight of me polyester copolymer. This temporary<br>
crosslinker can simultaneously increase the rate of polymerization and increase<br>
the pill resistance of a polyester copolymer.<br>
The present invention also provides a process for higher speed spinning to<br>
increase assets productivity. The normal spinning speed for partially oriented<br>
yarn (POY) is about 3000 to 3500 meter/min. Spuming speed is limited by the<br>
rate of crystallization during spinning. Temporary crosslinker glycolorganosilane<br>
reduces the crystallization rate therefore spinning speed can be<br>
increased to 3500-5000 m/min. The organosilane DmSD£aZp can be in the range<br>
from about O.Q1% to about 1%, preferably about 0.03% to 0.3%, based on the<br>
weight of the polyester copolymer.<br>
In case high speed spinning of 3500-5000 m/min is not desired, temporary<br>
crosslinker glycol-organosilane can reduce the crystallinity of POY. Normal draw<br>
texturing speed of POY is limited to about 900 m/min. When the crystallinity of<br>
POY decreases at normal speed 3000-3500 m/min due to the temporary<br>
crosslinker, draw texturing speed can be increased to about 1000 m/min.<br>
The glycol-organosilane composition disclosed above forms temporary<br>
crosslinks or branches hi the polyester, which hydrolyze after spinning hi the<br>
presence of moisture, water, an alcohol, a weak acid, or a weak base. It does not<br>
form rocks or sands in the TPA polymerization process where there is water<br>
byproduct After spuming and draw texturing, the temporary crosslinks or<br>
branches break down by hydrolysis with water hi process such as wet drawing and<br>
dye bath or moisture from the air. After hydrolysis, the fibers products are the<br>
same as 1<br>
- 12 -<br>
Preferably, the glycol-organosilane does not form any permanent Crosslink<br>
or branch which affects spinning performance. Because the glycol-organosilane<br>
composition is partially reacted, byproduct such as memanol can be removed<br>
before addihg to polymerization process, byproduct emission in polymerization<br>
The crosslinked polyester polymers disclosed above can be produced by<br>
any method known to one skilled hi the art A preferred process for producing the<br>
polymer comprises contacting a polymerization mixture with a crosslinker and,<br>
for producing a permanently crosslinked polyester copolymer, a comonomer<br>
disclosed above. The polymerization mixture can consist essentially of a glycol<br>
and a carbonyl compound disclosed above. The weight or mole of each<br>
compound required is the weight or mole mat can produce a desired copolyester<br>
disclosed above. For example, the molar ratio of the glycol to carbonyl<br>
compound can be any ratio so long as the ratio can effect the production of<br>
polyester disclosed above. Generally me ratio can be in the range of front about<br>
1:1 to about 10:1, preferably about 1:1 to about 4:1.<br>
A suitable condition to effect the production of a polyester can include a<br>
t the range of from about 200 °C to about 400 °C, and preferably<br>
250 °C to 300 °C under a pressure hi the range of from about 0.001 to about 1<br>
atmosphere (0.1 to 101.3 kPa) for a time period of from about 0.3 to about 20<br>
hours, preferably about 1 to about 10 hours.<br>
Also for example, the glycol-organosilane composition (or comonomer,<br>
second crosslinker, or both) can be added together or separately to the<br>
polymerization process before, during, or after transesterification of the carbonyl<br>
compound; before, during, or after esterification of the carbonyl compound.<br>
Similarly, me glycol-organosilane (or comonomer, second crosslinker, or both)<br>
can be added before, during, or after porycondensation of the carbonyl component<br>
or an oligomer of the carbonyl compound.<br>
Optionally, a sulfonated isophmalate metal salt such as sodium dimethyl<br>
sulfoisophthalate and lithium bis(2-hydroxyethy) 5-sulfoisophthalate or their<br>
glycol splutibn can be added to the polymerization mixture. The sulfonated<br>
isophthalate metal salt and crosslinker or comonomer can be added together or<br>
separately.<br>
I have unexpected found the polyester copolymer comprising a sulfonated<br>
isophthalate metal salt, a carbonyl compound, a glycol, a temporary crosslinker,<br>
and a comonomer is substantially soluble hi basic water solution. The polyester<br>
copolymer composition comprising a sulfonated isophthalate metal salt, a<br>
carbonyl compound, a glycol, with or without a comonomer, and a temporary<br>
crosslinker can be dyed by cationic dyes, or can have better dyeability by disperse<br>
dye. The sulfonated isophthalate metal salt, carbonyl compound, glycol,<br>
temporary crosslinker, and comonomer are the same as those described above.<br>
The comonomer and the crosslinker can be simply mixed, substantially<br>
dissolved, or reacted with a solvent A comonomer and a crosslinker containing<br>
one or mtyre Jiydroxyl groups can be substantially dissolved hi a solvent The<br>
solvent can be an alcohol or water, preferably an alkylene glycol which is a<br>
component of me polymerization mixture.<br>
A comonomer and a crosslinker containing one or more carboxyl groups<br>
can partially react or completely react with a glycol described above, preferably<br>
partially reacted. The preferred partially reacted comonomer-glycol solution or<br>
crosslinker-glycol solution can be prepared at the conditions similar to those<br>
described above to produce partially reacted glycol-organosilane composition.<br>
Optionally a catalyst such as a titanium catalyst can be added to the mixture.<br>
When a comonomer or crosslinker containing one or more carboxyl<br>
groups partially react with the alkylene glycol and substantially dissolve in the<br>
glycol, presently preferred solution is mat about 20% to about 99%, more<br>
preferably about 50% to about 95%, and most preferably 60% to 90%, of the<br>
The<br>
reaction product can bfc used as produced without further purification. The<br>
composition can also be further purified by any means known to one skilled in the<br>
art if desired. For example, a solution of isophthalic acid in glycol or a solution of<br>
trimellitic anhydride hi glycol can be heated between 40 °C and 220 °C,<br>
preferably between 100 °C and 190 °C, to partially or completely remove tod<br>
condense byproduct water.<br>
Optionally, other ingredients of the polymer such as catalyst, to T, optical<br>
brightener, TiOj, or phosphorous compounds can be mixed with the com omerglycol<br>
solution or crosslinker-glycol solution before they are added to the<br>
polymerization mixture.<br>
Any solvent mat can substantially dissolve the comonomer-glycol solut?,<br>
or crosslinker-glycol solution discussed above can be used to dissolve fte<br>
comonomer-glycol solution or crosslinker- glycol composition. The presently<br>
preferred solvent is alkylene glycol such as ethylene glycol, 1,3-propanediol, or<br>
1,4-butanediol.<br>
present of a catalyst and optionally a phosphorous compound. The catalyst,<br>
expressed as element Co, Sb, Mn, Zn, Si, Ge, or Ti, can be present hi the range of<br>
about 1 to. about 5,000 ppm of the reaction medium comprising the carbonyl<br>
compound and glycol, preferably about 10 to about 500 ppm, most preferably 30<br>
to 300 ppm, by weight A presently preferred polycondensatioh catalyst is<br>
antimony. Examples of suitable antimony compounds include, but are not limited<br>
to, antimony oxides, antimony acetate, antimony glycolates, antimony phosphates,<br>
and combinations of two or more thereof.<br>
Any phosphorus compound mat; when used with a polyester catalyst,<br>
produces polyester having low yellowness, as compared to a polyester produced<br>
from the catalyst without such phosphorus compound, can be used. Examples of<br>
suitable phosphorus compounds include, but are not limited to, a phosphoric acid<br>
or salt thereof, a phosphorous acid or salt thereof, a polyphosphoric acid or a salt<br>
thereof a pfaosphonate estefr, a pyrophosphoric acid or salt thereof, a<br>
pyrophosphorous acid or salt thereof, di(polyoxyethylene) hydroxymethyl<br>
phosphonate, triethyl phosphonoacetate, and combinations of two or more thereof.<br>
• The salt can be an alkali metal salt or an alkaline earth metal salt.<br>
Optionally, a TiOj or TiOj slurry can be added to the polymerization<br>
mixture. The polyester produced by the invention process can contain TiO2 about<br>
0.01% to about 5%, preferably about 0.03% to about 2.0%, based on polymer<br>
weight<br>
The invention process can also be carried out using conventional melt or<br>
solid state techniques and in the presence or absence of a toner compound to<br>
reduce the color of a polyester produced. Examples of toner compounds include,<br>
but are not limited to, cobalt aluminate, cobalt acetate, carbazole violet, these<br>
toner compounds are well known to those skilled in the art. The toner compound<br>
can be used in the amount Of about 0.1 ppm to 1000 ppm, preferably about 1 ppm<br>
to about i0p| fpm, based on the weight of polyester polymer produced.<br>
The process of me invention can also be carried out using a conventional<br>
melt or solid state technique and in the presence or absence of an optical<br>
brightening compound to reduce the yellowness of the polyester produced.<br>
Examples of optical brightening compounds include, but are not limited to, 7-<br>
naphthotriazinyl-3-phenylcoumarin and 4,4'-bis(2-benzoxazoIyI) stilbene These<br>
optical brightening compounds are well known to those skilled in the art The<br>
optical brightening compound can be used hi the amount of about 0.1 ppm to<br>
1,000 ppm, preferably about 1 ppm to about 100 ppm, based on the weight of<br>

EXAMPLES<br>
This example compares tetraemoxysilane (TEOS), n-propyltriethoxysilane<br>
(PES), and 3-AcetoxypropyttrfmemoxysiIane (APMS). TEOS molecule has four<br>
hydrolysable Si-O-C bonds, but no Si-C bonds. PES molecule has three<br>
hydrolysable Si-O-C bonds and one non-hydrolysable Si-C bond of the propyl<br>
group. APMS molecule also has three hydrolysable Si-O-C bonds and one jnon-<br>
hydrolysable Si-C bond of the propyl group. In addition, APMS molecule has an<br>
