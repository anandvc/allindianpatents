Method and system for extracting channel impulse response for mobile terminals from a neighboring cell<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates generally to wireless communication systems, and more particularly to a method and system for extracting channel impulse response for mobile terminals from a neighboring cell in the wireless communications system. BACKGROUND<br>
In cellular telephone or other wireless voice or data systems, a served area is divided into cells, each of which may be further divided into sectors. Each cell may be served by a single base station, which is further connected to a message switching center (MSC), a subscriber management system (SMS), or a data router via a base station controller (BSC). A plurality of wireless communication devices/ terminals are connected to the MSC, the SMS, or the router by establishing radio links with one or more nearby base stations.<br>
In earlier cellular telephone technology, such as time division multiple access (TDMA), as a wireless mobile terminal travels from one cell to another, the radio link between the terminal and the base station serving the first cell had to be broken and then replaced by a radio link between the terminal and the base station serving the second cell. In contrast, in a code division multiple access (CDMA) cellular telephone system, because the same frequency band is used for all cells and sectors, the first link need not be broken before connecting with the second link.<br>
In a Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) system, signals from a plurality of mobile terminals are mixed and overlapped in time and frequency domains. Since certain correlations exist between signals of individual mobile terminals, signals of different mobile terminals at the receiving end will interfere with each other, and such interference is commonly called Multi-Access Interference (MAI). Although the<br><br><br>
WO 2007/003114<br><br>
PCT/CN2006/001485<br><br>
MAI generated by a mobile terminal is very small, as the number of mobile terminals or signal power increases, MAI becomes one of major interferences in a CDMA system.<br>
A TD-SCDMA system eliminates the MAI through a technique called multi-mobile terminal joint detection in order to increase anti-interference ability of the system. Multi-mobile terminal joint detection no longer treats signals from other terminals blindly as interference signals. Instead, it fully utilizes midamble information included in the received signals, such as the channel impulse response of each mobile terminal, and simultaneously extracts signals of all the mobile terminals from the received signals. With the multi-mobile terminal joint detection, anti-interference ability of TD-SCDMA systems is largely enhanced, as well as system capacity and coverage.<br>
In the current multi-mobile terminal joint detecting technique, the TD-SCDMA system firstly determines impulse responses of mobile terminals based on a predetermined training sequence known as a midamble sent by the mobile terminals in normal timeslots, and determines a channel estimation window of each mobile terminal based on cyclic offsets of the midamble. Upon determining the location of channel estimation window of each mobile terminal, a base station is able to extract the channel impulse response of each individual mobile terminal from the channel impulse responses of all mobile terminals under its coverage. Thereafter, the multi-mobile terminal joint detection can be performed based on the channel impulse response of each mobile terminal.<br>
One prerequisite for performing multi-mobile terminal joint detection is that the channel impulse response of each mobile terminal must first be obtained. In the TD-SCDMA system, each timeslot of each subframe includes two data fields and one training sequence field. The midamble distributed by the system is sent in the training sequence field of an uplink timeslot, so as to allow the base station to perform channel<br><br><br>
WO 2007/003114<br><br>
PCT/CN2006/001485<br><br>
estimation and synchronization control. The TD-SCDMA system assigns a basic midamble for each cell, where different cells use different basic midamble which have certain orthogonal characteristics. Midambles used by different mobile terminals in the same cell are obtained by cyclic shifting or offsetting the basic midamble of the cell, and the cyclic offsets of different mobile terminals are different. Thus, the base station can simultaneously estimate the channel impulse responses of all mobile terminals in the current cell by distinguishing midambles sent by mobile terminals in the current cell and those of neighboring cells by certain operations through the use of basic midamble of the current cell. Since the midambles used by different mobile terminals in the same cell have different cyclic offsets, thus the channel impulse responses of different mobile terminals in the same cell will have different time delays. In order to receive and detect signals from various mobile terminals, their channel impulse responses are obtained and processed through various corresponding channel estimation windows. That is, the channel impulse responses of different mobile terminals in the same cell should be located at different channel estimation windows. Channel estimation window of each mobile terminal can be determined by the cyclic offset of midamble used by the respective mobile terminal. After the channel estimation window of each mobile terminal is determined, the base station can respectively segment the channel impulse response of each individual mobile terminal from the channel impulse responses of all mobile terminals in the current cell. The multi-mobile terminal joint detection can then be performed based on each mobile terminal's channel impulse response.<br>
However, it can be seen from the above process of determining channel impulse responses, a base station currently can only determine the uplink channel impulse responses of all mobile terminals in its cell, and therefore, can only perform multi-mobile terminal joint detection on uplink signals of all mobile terminals in the current cell.  In a particular cell, since the mobile terminals from the neighboring cells are<br><br><br>
WO 2007/003114<br><br>
PCT/CN2006/001485<br><br>
synchronized with the base stations in the corresponding neighboring cells, they, and other received uplink signals of mobile terminals from the neighboring cells are entirely treated as unknown MAIs.<br>
What is needed is an improved method and system for effectively reducing multi-cell interferences by identifying impulse responses of a mobile terminal from a neighboring cell for effectively reducing MAI and achieving better communication quality. <br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
A method and system is disclosed for determining channel impulse response estimation window in a current cell for at least one mobile terminal from a neighboring cell. According to one embodiment of the present invention, for all the cells, at least two channel impulse response peak locations of each mobile terminal are preset in a first and a second predetermined periods with a predetermined peak location change pattern. Upon receiving communication from the mobile terminal, channel impulse responses are analyzed to identify the peak location change pattern with regard to a first and a second peak locations. A channel impulse response estimation window is then determined for the mobile terminal based on the analyzed channel impulse responses and a preferred estimation window size.

of the present invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Although the present invention is illustrated below with regard to a few limited examples, it is understood that the present invention is applicable to any multiple access technologies which implement frequency division for multiple access channelization. Such access technologies include Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA), Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA), Multi-Carrier Code Division Multiple Access (MC-CDMA), and Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplex Multiple Access (OFDM-MA) and any combination thereof, whether synchronized or unsynchronized, using Frequency Division Duplex (FDD) or Time Division Duplex (TDD).<br>
Fig. 1 illustrates a wireless communication network 100. As an example, there are three neighboring cells 102, 104, and 106 shown in the network. Typically, a base transceiver station (BTS) situated at the center of each cell is responsible for communicating with all mobile terminals within the boundaries of the cell.<br>
When a mobile terminal 110 of cell 104 moves towards cell 102, as the mobile terminal 110 moves farther and farther away from the base station 112, it will continuously increase its transmission power in order to maintain the communication quality. As such, the uplink signal transmitted by the mobile terminal 110 generates an increasing amount of MAI to all mobile terminals in its neighboring cells.<br>
In order to suppress the interference from the mobile terminal 110's uplink signal, mobile terminals in the neighboring cell 102, for example, will also increase their transmission powers to maintain their communication qualities. They in turn generate more MAI to their respective neighboring cells, which will further causes the mobile terminals in cells 104 and 106, such as mobile terminal 110 to further increase its transmission power. As such, an inter-cell power increase inducement feedback is formed, causing the interference level of the entire network to increase<br><br><br>
WO 2007/003114<br><br>
PCT/CN2006/001485<br><br>
continuously. This ultimately and definitely leads to a decrease in overall system capacity and quality due to limited transmission power of the communications system.<br>
In the current TD-SCDMA system, a base station only performs multi-mobile terminal joint detection on uplink signals of all mobile terminals in its own cell, uplink signals of mobile terminals in neighboring cells received are treated as unknown MAIs. Thus, multi-mobile terminal joint detecting method can only suppress MAIs among mobile terminals in the same cell, and not including mobile terminals in neighboring cells.<br>
As explained above, if the base station can identify parameters (such as scrambling codes, code channels, basic midambles and channel impulse responses etc.) used by mobile terminals in the same-frequency neighboring cells that cause MAI to the current cell, the base station can perform a multi-mobile terminal joint detection on uplink signals of mobile terminals in the current cell and from the neighboring cells. As a result, it significantly reduces interference, thereby improving the system quality and capacity.<br>
For a base station in a particular cell, information such as scrambling codes, code channels and basic midambles of the neighboring cells can be obtained from system configuration. Thus, in order to allow mobile terminals from the neighboring cells to participate in the joint detection, it is important to obtain accurate channel impulse responses of the mobile terminals involved from the neighboring cells.<br>
In a TD-SCDMA system, since each mobile terminal is synchronized with the cell in which the mobile terminal is located, communications from the mobile terminals of the neighboring cells are most likely not synchronized with the current cell. Although it is easy for a base station to identify the channel estimation windows of all mobile terminals in its own cell, it is not easy to detect the channel estimation windows of mobile terminals from the neighboring cells. As a result of this, reliable channel impulse responses of mobile terminals of the neighboring cells cannot be<br><br><br>
WO 2007/003114<br><br>
PCT/CN2006/001485<br><br>
obtained. The present invention provides a novel method for determining windows for identifying channel impulse responses of mobile terminals from the neighboring cells.<br>
As stated above, each mobile terminal maintains uplink reception synchronization with other mobile terminals in the current cell via a so-called uplink synchronization control. For a mobile terminal from the neighboring cell, despite that synchronization is maintained with its own cell, the uplink signals reach the base station of the current cell is not synchronized with respect to the current cell. Moreover, the channel estimation windows are unknown due to the fact that the transmission distances are different from one mobile terminal to another as one may be further away from another from the base station of the current cell. For mobile terminals of the current cell, the estimation windows for the channel impulse responses are fixed. For the mobile terminals from the neighboring cells, although their estimation windows are unpredictable as the time at which signals from the mobile terminals of neighboring cells reach the current cell are disordered and unknown, for mobile terminals from a particular cell, the relative locations of the estimation windows remain the same as they are still under effective synchronization control of the respective neighboring cells. What is needed is to find a way to identify the estimation window of one reference mobile terminal such as the first mobile terminal from a predetermined neighboring cell, and the rest of the estimation windows of the mobile terminals from the same neighboring cell can be discerned based on the determinable relative locations between any two. It is understood that the first mobile terminal is not the only choice for the reference mobile terminal as long as a reference terminal can be pre-configured to be readily identified on the receiving end.<br>
The present invention provides a method that artificially generates a predetermined characteristic variation in channel impulse response peak locations<br><br><br>
WO 2007/003114<br><br>
PCT/CN2006/001485<br><br>
and estimates the channel response estimation windows of the mobile terminals from the neighboring cell based on these variations such that the channel impulse responses of the mobile terminals from the neighboring cell can be determined for joint detection.<br>
Fig. 2 illustrates a frame structure of a TD-SCDMA system. As shown in Fig. 2, each frame of the TD-SCDMA system includes 7 basic timeslots (TS0, TS1,..., TS6) and 3 special timeslots (i.e., Downlink Pilot Time Slot DwPTS, Guard Period GP and Uplink Pilot Time Slot UpPTS). Each basic timeslot includes two data fields and one training sequence field. Users transmit traffic data on the data fields and transmit system assigned midamble on the training sequence field of an uplink timeslot to allow a base station to perform channel estimation and synchronization control. The TD-SCDMA system assigns a basic midamble for each cell, where different cells use different basic midamble with certain orthogonal characteristics so that cell-to-cell interference is reduced. Midambles used by different mobile terminals in the same cell are obtained by cyclic shifting the basic midamble of the cell. As such, the cyclic offsets of different mobile terminals are different but bear a predetermined relation with each other. Thus, the base station can simultaneously estimate the channel impulse responses of all mobile terminals in the current cell by distinguishing midambles sent by mobile terminals since it is clearly informed of the basic midamble of the current cell. The channel impulse responses of different mobile terminals in the same cell can be located at different channel estimation windows. Channel estimation window of each mobile terminal can be determined based on the unique cyclic offset of the midamble used by the respective mobile terminal. For example, assuming that the cyclic offset of each mobile terminal relative to the previous mobile terminal is 16 chips and the total length of the channel impulse response is 128 chips, the estimation window of the first mobile terminal is set to be the beginning 16 chips of responses received from all mobile terminals in the current<br><br><br>
WO 2007/003114<br><br>
PCT/CN2006/001485<br><br>
cell. The second mobile terminal will have the next 16 chips for its estimation window. Based on this principle, the lst-16th chip corresponding to the channel impulse response of nth mobile terminal can be represented and identified as (n-1)* 16*4-1 ~n*16th chips. In order to ensure that the channel impulse response of each mobile terminal does not exceed the range of the estimation window, normally a channel impulse response peak location is set at the first 1/3 or 1/2 of the estimation window. If the length of an estimation window is 16 chips long, and the channel impulse response peak location is normally from the 6th to 8th chip.<br>
The present invention provides predetermined change pattern for the advancement of transmission time for each mobile terminal so that there is a unique correlation for each mobile terminal and its channel impulse response based on at least two response peak locations. Based on such unique correlation, the channel impulse response estimation window can be determined appropriately.<br>
For illustration purposes, it is assumed that for each mobile terminal, the advancement of transmission time is set so that two channel impulse response peak locations are identifiable. It is further assumed that the system frame period is N, channel impulse response peak locations are Tl and T2 wherein T1<t2 and their corresponding periods are ml m2. for simplifying the illustration it is further assumed that mod m14-m2 i.e. n an integer multiple of></t2>
Figs. 3A-3B illustrate configuration of channel impulse response peak locations according to one embodiment of the present disclosure. With regard to Fig. 3 A and 3B, when 0

basic midamble is set to T2, just a few chips away from Tl. Through uplink synchronization control, the channel impulse response peak can be stabilized at T2. The distance between Tl and T2 can be referred to as a peak offset, which would be important for determining the estimation window eventually.<br>
As stated above, if the length of the estimation window, W, is about 16 chips, the first channel impulse response peak location of the second mobile terminal corresponding to the second shifting sequence of the basic midamble can be set to T2+16 chips, and the third mobile terminal can be at T1+32 chips, etc.<br>
Similar to setting up the first mobile terminal, the second channel impulse response peak location of the second mobile terminal can be intentionally set at T1+16 chips, and the second channel impulse response peak location of the third mobile terminal can be set to T2+32 chips. As shown, after the two peak locations of the first mobile terminal are set at Tl and T2, the subsequently pairs of peak locations can be set based on the relation represented by (n-l)*W+T2 and (n-l)*W+Tl and the relation represented by (n-l)*W+Tl and (n-l)*W+T2 alternately. That is, if nth mobile terminal uses (n-l)*W+Tl and (n-l)*W+T2 as its first and second peak locations, the (n+l)th or (n-l)th mobile terminal sets its first and second peak locations as ((n+l)-l)*W+T2 and ((n+l)-l)*W+Tl, and ((n-l)-l)*W+T2 and «n-l)-1)*W+T1 respectively. It is understood that where the second peak is placed can be different as long as the relative location of such is known and/or conveyed to the base station. It is the unique relation between the first and second peaks of each mobile terminal that will be put in processing for determining the channel estimation window.<br>
Similar to the above, when M1+M2

When 2*M1+M2 
During this configuration process, nothing has to be changed the existing hardware setup of the communications system. The mobile terminals also do not need any modifications. The configuration process can be administered by the base station. In order to perform the configuration, the base station and the mobile terminals will coordinate on the values of the parameters such as Tl, T2, Ml and M2 etc., and they can be easily communicated through signaling. The preferred estimation window size is denoted by W (e.g., 16 chips).<br>
It is understood that if the above configuration is done appropriately, for the nth mobile terminal from a particular neighboring cell in a particular time slot, the two peak locations should maintain the relation, i.e., the relation between (n-l)*W+T1 and (n-l)*W+T2. Due to the travel of signals, there will be a delay offset A that will be built in the signal received by the base station. That is, the (n-l)*W+T1 will become (n-l)*W+Tl+ A and (n-l)*W+T2 will become (n-l)*W+T2+A. However, for all the mobile terminals from a neighboring cell, the delay offset should be the same. Therefore, the difference between two peak locations, i.e., [(n-l)*W+Tl+A]-[(n-l)*W+T2+A] will still be the same as T1-T2. This delay offset will be important for deciding on the estimation window.<br>
Once the system is configured, the base station can always extract the unique peak offset between two peak locations (or peak change pattern) in the channel impulse response of a particular mobile terminal from the neighboring cell, and determines on its estimation window.<br>
The process of determining channel impulse response estimation windows can<br><br><br>
WO 2007/003114<br><br>
PCT/CN2006/001485<br><br>
be divided into several steps. In the first step, estimating channel impulse responses in each timeslot based on the training sequence of the current cell and each neighboring cell. The channel impulse response contains channel impulse responses of all mobile terminals from the neighboring cell as well as the responses from the current cell. The channel impulse response is formed collectively by a series of response taps, which indicate sampling points at which the signal power exceeds a predetermined threshold power.<br>
Then, a process is implemented to filter and keep certain response taps based on predetermined rules. For example, during time 0= Pn + Th_SNR, then this tap is a selected response tap. Examining the selected response taps, there will be various identifiable peak locations.<br>
The statistical response characteristics derived from the first and second stable conditions are compared, and the peak offsets between peak locations are examined, the channel impulse response of a mobile terminal from the neighboring cell can then be identified based on the unique peak offset acknowledged. In addition, if any historical data is available that represents the statistical response characteristics, it can also be used to help the filtering process. It is understood that due to the existence of multi-paths, it needs to be determined whether a certain response tap is attributed to a multi-path. For example, the energy center point of a group of response taps representing multi-path taps can be used as a response from its primary path.<br><br><br>
WO 2007/003114<br><br>
PCT/CN2006/001485<br><br>
Now, with the channel response at hand, with the consideration of a possible range of the channel impulse response for the primary path for the mobile terminal from the neighboring cell, and that for the multi-path condition, the channel impulse response estimation window for the mobile terminal is then determined. As stated above, the estimation window should normally be smaller than 16 chips. As it is illustrated with Figs. 3 A and 3B, if the initial configuration is such that the direction of the shifting of the second peak is alternating, the determination of the estimation window should also take that into consideration. For example, if the second peak shifts forward from the first peak for the first mobile terminal, but shifts backward for the second mobile terminals, alternately shifts forward again, the estimation window for the first mobile terminal should provide enough space (e.g., chips) to accommodate these changes.<br>
Fig. 4 illustrates a process flow 400 for determining channel impulse response estimation windows for extracting channel impulse response of mobile terminals from the neighboring cell according to one embodiment of the present invention. In step 402, an initial configuration step is taken so that at least two predetermined peak locations for the mobile terminals for each cell are preset so that they present a change pattern for identifying the mobile terminal. In other words, the expected peak locations can be programmed and used as an index for finding the associated mobile terminal. For example, it can be configured so that the peak offset between the two peak locations for each cell is unique. This can be done by controlling the amount of transmission advancement time. Different mobile terminals are expected to have their respective peak locations of the channel impulse responses spread out in different groups of chips, but the peak location for a particular mobile terminal should always be stabilized on one of its corresponding expected peak locations. In one embodiment, the peak change pattern, which is the peak offset, for each mobile terminal is further maintained consistently within a cell. As an alternative, the peak<br><br><br>
WO 2007/003114<br><br>
PCT/CN2006/001485<br><br>
offset can vary as long as the pattern for the peak locations for each mobile terminal is identifiable. For illustration purposes, it is assumed that the peak offset for each mobile terminal is expected to be consistently the same through out the cell, and this can be done by the operation of the base station. The relevant peak offset information is conveyed to other cells so that each cell is aware of the unique peak patterns or peak offsets for its neighboring cell. Alternatively, said at least two predetermined peak locations can be the same for each mobile terminal, while the change patterns of each mobile terminal are different, so that each mobile terminal can be identified according to a preset change regulation.<br>
In step 404, when the base station receives and processes the channel impulse response with mobile terminals from the current cell as well as one or more neighboring cells based on a training sequence, the channel impulse response estimation window of the current cell is determined using conventional methods. In step 406, the channel impulse response of each neighboring cell is separated based on different midables used. Further in step 408, during the first and second stable response periods, statistical response characteristics are determined for a predetermined period of time for eliminating unneeded noises. In this predetermined period of time, responses taps are selectively filtered and remained for further processing based on a predetermined set of rules. In step 410, the channel impulse response in the first stable response period and the second stable response period are compared and studied to identify the peak locations for each mobile terminal from the neighboring cell based on the unique peak offset. As a result, the channel impulse response of the primary path of the communication between the mobile terminal and the base station for each mobile terminal from each neighboring cell is identified. Then, in step 412, the estimation window for each mobile terminal is determined taking into consideration of the variation range of the channel impulse response for the primary path. Once the estimation window is set, this window can be used to<br><br><br>

PCT/CN2006/001485<br><br>
extract the channel impulse response for each mobile terminal from the neighboring cell in step 414. With that information on hand, a joint detection process can be performed along with communications from mobile terminals so that interference from the neighboring cell can be subsequently reduced.<br>
It is understood that the above illustration uses one particular peak offset pattern (e.g., Tl and T2 are alternatively used for different mobile terminals), it is not limited to this example. Any preset change patterns can be used for identifying the channel impulse response peak locations can be implemented as long as the base station and the mobile terminals are configured to perform accordingly. The change patterns of the peak locations for the mobile terminals can be designed in various ways as long as the resulting estimation window for each mobile terminal is identifiable from its neighboring estimation windows. It is further noted that once the channel impulse response estimation windows for mobile terminals from the neighboring cells are determined, a joint detection method can be performed in order to reduce the interferences from such mobile terminals from the neighboring cell. Such a novel joint detection method is disclosed in a co-pending PCT application whose application number is PCT/CN2005/001539, title is time slot CDMA multi-cell joint detection method, which is also assigned to the same assignee.<br>
