				<td>Description<br>
Apparatus and process for annealing a Multilayer body,<br>
and Multilayer body of this type<br>
The invention relates to an apparatus for annealing a<br>
multilayer body, which has a first layer and at least<br>
one second layer, through uptake of a quantity of<br>
energy by the multilayer body involving uptake of a<br>
first partial quantity of the quantity of energy by the<br>
first layer and uptake of a second partial quantity of<br>
the quantity of energy by the second layer, having at<br>
least one energy source. An apparatus of this type is<br>
known, for example, from EP 0 662 247 B1. As well as<br>
the apparatus, the invention also proposes a process<br>
for annealing a multilayer body and a multilayer body<br>
of this type.<br>
A multilayer body is produced, for example, by applying<br>
a functional layer to a substrate layer. To ensure that<br>
-he functional layer and/or the substrate layer has a<br>
desired physical (electrical, mechanical, etc.) and/or<br>
chemical property, under certain circumstances it is<br>
necessary for the multilayer body or the layer and/or<br>
the substrate layer to be processed. The processing<br>
comprises, for example, annealing of the multilayer<br>
body in the presence of a gas (process gas).<br>
A multilayer body is, for example, a large-area thin-<br>
film solar cell, in which an electrode layer comprising<br>
molybdenum and a functional copper-indium-diselenide<br>
(CIS) semiconductor layer are applied to a substrate<br>
layer of glass. This thin-film solar cell is produced<br>
in a two-stage process according to EP 0 662 247 Bl. In<br>
a first stage, the following elements are applied in<br>
layer form, in order, to the glass substrate layer:<br>
molybdenum, copper, indium and selenium. In a second<br>
stage, the multilayer body obtained in this way is<br>
annealed, leading to the formation of the copper-indium<br>
diselenide semiconductor layer.<br>
For annealing, the multilayer body is arranged in a<br>
closed container made from graphite. During the<br>
annealing, a defined partial pressure of gaseous<br>
selenium is formed in the interior of the container,<br>
the layers which have been applied to the glass being<br>
brought into contact with the gaseous selenium.<br>
During the annealing, the multilayer body takes up a<br>
quantity of energy, each layer being supplied with a<br>
partial quantity of the quantity of energy. The<br>
annealing takes place, for example, at a heat-up rate<br>
of 10°C/s. The energy source for the quantity of energy<br>
which is used is a halogen lamp. The halogen lamp is<br>
used to irradiate the graphite container and thus to<br>
heat the container. An operation of this type is<br>
particularly efficient, since graphite which acts, as<br>
it were, as a "black body radiator", has a high<br>
absorption capacity for electromagnetic radiation, in<br>
particular for radiation in the spectral region of the<br>
halogen lamp. The quantity of energy absorbed by the<br>
graphite is fed to the multilayer body by heat<br>
radiation and/or heat conduction. The container<br>
therefore functions as a secondary energy source or as<br>
an energy transmitter.<br>
Graphite has a high emission capacity and a high<br>
thermal conductivity. When the multilayer body is<br>
resting on a base of the container, the quantity of<br>
energy is supplied to an underside of the multilayer<br>
body substantially by heat conduction. A quantity of<br>
energy is fed to an upper side of the multilayer body<br>
by heat radiation.<br>
On account of an asymmetric layer structure of the<br>
multilayer body and/or a different quantity of energy<br>
being supplied to the top side and the underside of the<br>
multilayer body, a high heating rate may lead to<br>
inhomogeneous, i.e. non-uniform annealing of the layers<br>
of the<br>
multilayer body. Temperature inhomogeneity may form in<br>
the thickness direction of the multilayer body and,<br>
given a coefficient of thermal expansion of a material<br>
of a layer which is not zero, may lead to mechanical<br>
stress within the layer and/or the multilayer body.<br>
This mechanical stress may cause the layer and/or the<br>
multilayer body to crack or fracture. The mechanical<br>
stress may also lead to deformation (distortion) of the<br>
multilayer body. In the case of a substrate layer made<br>
from glass, the deformation is generally transient,<br>
i.e. disappears again after the annealing. The<br>
deformation may also be permanent. In this case, the<br>
deformation does not disappear again. This is the case<br>
if a softening point of the substrate layer (e.g. of<br>
glass) is exceeded during the annealing and an<br>
(internal) mechanical stress and/or an external force<br>
becomes active.<br>
The larger the area of the multilayer body and the<br>
higher the annealing rate (heating rate, cooling rate),<br>
the more difficult it becomes to deliberately influence<br>
temperature inhomogeneities in the multilayer body<br>
during the annealing of the multilayer body and the<br>
greater the likelihood of an undesirable mechanical<br>
stress occurring.<br>
It is an object of the invention to demonstrate how<br>
temperature homogeneity or tevperature inhomogeneity<br>
can be deliberately influenced during the annealing of<br>
a large-area multilayer body with a high annealing<br>
rate.<br>
To achieve the object, the invention proposes an<br>
apparatus for annealing a multilayer body, which has a<br>
first layer and at least one second layer, through<br>
uptake of a quantity of energy by the multilayer body<br>
involving uptake of a first partial quantity of the<br>
quantity of energy by the first layer and uptake of a<br>
second partial quantity of the quantity of energy by<br>
the second layer, having at least one<br>
energy source for the quantity of energy. The apparatus<br>
is characterized in that a first energy source and at<br>
least one second energy source are present, at least<br>
one of the energy sources emits a defined<br>
electromagnetic radiation with a radiation field, at<br>
least one of the layers has a defined absorpcion for<br>
the electromagnetic radiation, the first layer can be<br>
arranged between the first energy source and the second<br>
layer, and the second layer can be arranged between the<br>
second energy source and the first layer, in such a<br>
manner that the layer which absorbs the electromagnetic<br>
radiation is situated in the radiation field, and at<br>
least one transparency body, which has a defined<br>
transmission and a defined absorption with respect to<br>
the electromagnetic radiation is arranged in the<br>
radiation field between the energy source with the<br>
radiation field and the layer which absorbs the<br>
electromagnetic radiation.<br>
The idea of the invention consists in individually<br>
heating the layers of the multilayer body, i.e. of<br>
deliberately controlling, regulating and/or presetting<br>
the partial quantity of the quantity of energy which is<br>
taken up by a layer. By way of example, a quantity of<br>
energy is determined with the aid of a control circuit<br>
during the annealing (see below) . It is also<br>
conceivable for the energy sources to be preset (e.g.<br>
energy density, nature of the energy, etc.), without<br>
the need for an additional control circuit. The<br>
invention allows individual heating of the layers of<br>
the multilayer body even at very high heating rates of<br>
1°C/s up to, for example, 50°C/s and above. The<br>
individual heating makes it possible to minimize<br>
mechanical stress and deformation of the multilayer<br>
body which may result under certain circumstances<br>
during the annealing.<br>
The basis for this is the transparency body, which is<br>
optically semitransparent. The transmission, which<br>
lies, for example, at a defined wavelength between 0.1<br>
and 0.9, causes the electromagnetic radiation described<br>
above to pass through the transparency body onto a<br>
layer. The layer can take up a corresponding quantity<br>
of energy or partial quantity of the quantity of energy<br>
which is emitted directly from the energy source.<br>
However, the transparency body also has a certain<br>
absorption for the electromagnetic radiation. The<br>
energy which is thereby taken up may be emitted to a<br>
surrounding area in the form of heat radiation and/or<br>
heat conduction. In a particular configuration, the<br>
apparatus for annealing a multilayer body has a<br>
transparency body which radiates and/or conducts heat<br>
in the direction of the multilayer body through the<br>
absorption of the electromagnetic radiation. In this<br>
way, it is possible to anneal a layer by heat radiation<br>
and/or heat conduction.<br>
It is also conceivable for a first layer of the<br>
multilayer body, which transmits the heat radiation, to<br>
be annealed substantially only by the heat conduction,<br>
while a second layer of the same multilayer body is<br>
annealed substantially by the heat radiation from the<br>
same transparency body. A first layer which exhibits<br>
corresponding transmission is, for example, a layer<br>
comprising glass. If electromagnetic radiation from an<br>
energy source and/or a transparency body comes into<br>
contact with the glass body, a small proportion of the<br>
radiation (approximately 4%) is reflected. Most of the<br>
radiation ( &gt; 90%) passes through the glass more or<br>
lees without obstacle and then impinges on a second<br>
layer of the multilayer body, where this radiation can<br>
be absorbed and can lead to a quantity of energy being<br>
taken up by this second layer. The glass layer cannot<br>
be annealed sufficiently quickly by radiation or heat<br>
radiation at a very high heating rate. By contrast.<br>
relatively quick annealing can be achieved by heat<br>
conduction if<br>
the transparency body is able to take up a partial<br>
quantity of the quantity of energy and transmit it to<br>
the glass layer.<br>
The situation in which the transparency body itself is<br>
a layer of the multilayer body is also conceivable. The<br>
transparency body can take up a partial quantity of the<br>
quantity of energy through absorption of part of the<br>
electromagnetic radiation and, by transmission, can<br>
pass on a further partial quantity of the quantity of<br>
energy in order for this partial quantity to be taken<br>
up by a further layer.<br>
In a particular configuration, a multilayer body in<br>
which one layer functions as a substrate layer for at<br>
least one further layer is used in the process. The<br>
multilayer body has in particular an asymmetric layer<br>
sequence. By way of example, the multilayer body<br>
comprises a substrate layer which is coated on one<br>
side. Individual layers of the multilayer body may also<br>
be arranged next to one another.<br>
In a particular configuration, one layer of the<br>
multilayer body includes a material which is selected<br>
from the group consisting of glass, glass-ceramic,<br>
ceramic, metal and/or plastic. A suitable plastic is in<br>
particular heat-resistant plastic, such as Teflon. One<br>
layer is, for example, a metal foil. The metal foil may<br>
also function as a substrate layer.<br>
The partial quantity of the quantity of energy which is<br>
taken up by a layer is dependent, for example, on an<br>
absorption, emission and/or reflection property of the<br>
layer. However, it is also dependent on the nature of<br>
the energy source and on the way in which the quantity<br>
of energy is transmitted to the multilayer body or to a<br>
layer of the multilayer body.<br>
The annealing of the multilayer body or of a layer<br>
takes place, for example, with the aid of an energy<br>
source for thermal energy. The layer may be supplied<br>
with the thermal energy<br>
directly. Heat radiation, heat conduction and/or<br>
convection are suitable means for achieving this. In<br>
the case of heat radiation, the energy source itself<br>
may be a source of heat radiation. The heat radiation<br>
is, for example, electromagnetic radiation in the<br>
wavelength range between 0.7 and 4.5 µm (infrekred<br>
light) . The corresponding layer is arranged in the<br>
radiation field of the energy source. The electromagnetic<br>
radiation from the energy source impinges on<br>
the layer, which at least partially absorbs the<br>
electromagnetic radiation.<br>
However, it is also possible for a layer to be supplied<br>
with any desired energy, which is converted into<br>
thermal energy in the layer. By way of example, a layer<br>
is irradiated with high-energy UV light, which the<br>
layer absorbs. Absorption of a high-energy light<br>
quantum causes a molecule of the layer or the entire<br>
layer to become electronically excited. Energy which is<br>
taken up in the process can be converted into thermal<br>
energy.<br>
As well as heat radiation and heat conduction, it is<br>
also possible for a layer or the entire body to be<br>
annealed through convection. In this case, a gas witih a<br>
defined energy is guided past the layer, the gas<br>
releasing the energy to the layer. The gas which is<br>
guided past may simultaneously function as process gas.<br>
Moreover, a layer can also be cooled by heat conduction<br>
and/or convection. In this case, negative thermal<br>
energy is supplied to the layer. In this way, it is<br>
also possible to control the quantities of energy or<br>
the partial quantities of the quantities of energy and,<br>
for example, to additionally influence the mechanical<br>
stresses in the multilayer body.<br>
In a particular configuration, there is an energy<br>
transmitter for transmitting the quantity of energy to<br>
the multilayer body.<br>
The energy transmitter functions as a secondary energy<br>
source. The energy transmitter absorbs, by way of<br>
example, electromagnetic radiation from a primary<br>
energy source, e.g. a halogen lamp, from a higher<br>
energy area and converts this electromagnetic radiation<br>
into heat radiation which is absorbed by the layer.<br>
The indirect and/or direct vicinity of the multilayer<br>
body can function as energy transmitter during the<br>
annealing, it is conceivable for an energy transmitter<br>
to be arranged with the multilayer body which is to be<br>
annealed in an interior space of a container. The<br>
energy transmitter may also be arranged outside the<br>
container, for example on a wall of the container or at<br>
a distance from the container. It is conceivable for<br>
the energy transmitter to be a coating of the<br>
container. By way of example, the energy transmitter<br>
may be a graphite film. It is even possible for the<br>
container itself to act as an energy transmitter. A<br>
function of this type is provided, for example, in the<br>
case of a container made from graphite. Finally, the<br>
transparency body is nothing other than an energy<br>
transmitter. Likewise, a gas, when transmitting energy<br>
through convection, acts as an energy transmitter.<br>
A quantity of energy which is taken up by the<br>
multilayer body may differ not only from layer to layer<br>
but also within a layer. By way of example, during the<br>
annealing an edge effect occurs in the multilayer body<br>
or in a layer of a multilayer body. An edge region of<br>
the layer is at a different temperature from an inner<br>
region of the layer. During the annealing, a lateral<br>
temperature gradient is established. This takes place,<br>
for example, if a radiation field of the energy source<br>
is inhomogeneous. In this case, an energy density of<br>
the radiation field over a surface through which the<br>
radiation is radiated is not identical everywhere.<br>
Lateral temperature inhomogeneity may also be<br>
established when the radiation field is homogeneous, if<br>
a greater quantity of energy per unit volume is<br>
absorbed at the edge of a layer, on account of the<br>
larger absorbing area per unit volume. To compensate<br>
for the temperature gradient, it is possible, for<br>
example, to use an energy source which comprises a<br>
multiplicity of subunits. Each subunit may be actuated<br>
separately, and in this way each quantity of energy<br>
supplied from a subunit to a layer can be set<br>
separately. An example of an energy source of this type<br>
is an array or matrix of individual heater elements. An<br>
example of a heater element is a halogen lamp. The<br>
array or matrix can also be used to produce a lateral<br>
temperature gradient in the layer. In this way, it<br>
would be possible, for example, to deliberately produce<br>
permanent or transient deformation of the layer body.<br>
An array or matrix is highly advantageous in particular<br>
for the annealing of a multilayer body in which layers<br>
lie next to one another.<br>
In connection with the energy source, it is<br>
advantageous if the energy source or sources operate<br>
continuously. However, it is also conceivable for the<br>
energy sources to make the quantity of energy or the<br>
partial quantities of the quantity of energy available<br>
to the layers in a cyclical or pulsed mode. An energy<br>
source of this type is, for example, an energy source<br>
with pulsed electromagnetic radiation. In this way, a<br>
quantity of energy can be supplied to the layers at the<br>
same time or in a temporal sequence (e.g. alternately) .<br>
The following properties of the energy source for<br>
electromagnetic radiation are particularly<br>
advantageous:<br>
• The energy source has a homogeneous radiation field.<br>
• A spectral intensity distribution of the energy<br>
source partially overlaps a spectral absorption of<br>
the layer, of the transparency body and of any<br>
container which may be present (cf. below) .<br>
Foreign Version<br>
• In the presence of a process gas, the energy source<br>
is resistant to and/or protected from corrosion.<br>
• The energy source has a high energy density, which is<br>
sufficient to enable a mass of the multilayer body<br>
(and if appropriate that of a container) to be heated<br>
with a heating rate of over 1°C/s.<br>
In a particular configuration, the transparency body of<br>
the apparatus has at least one spacer, onto which the<br>
multilayer body can be placed in order for a laterally<br>
homogeneous quantity of energy to be taken up by the<br>
multilayer body. By way of example, the layer by means<br>
of which the multilayer body rests on the transparency<br>
body or the spacer is annealed primarily by homogeneous<br>
thermal radiation. In this form, the spacer preferably<br>
includes a material which has a low level of absorption<br>
for the electromagnetic radiation. A spacer projects<br>
beyond a surface of the transparency body, for example<br>
by a few µm to mm.<br>
The layer resting on the spacers may also be annealed<br>
primarily through heat conduction. For this purpose,<br>
the spacers have, for example, a thermal conductivity<br>
which is required in order to achieve the corresponding<br>
annealing rate. It is also conceivable for the spacer,<br>
in order to transmit energy by heat conduction, to have<br>
a high absorption in respect of electromagnetic<br>
radiation from an energy source, the electromagnetic<br>
radiation being efficiently converted into thermal<br>
energy.<br>
In particular, the transparency body has a multiplicity<br>
of spacers of this type. With a multiplicity of spacers<br>
which are arranged evenly, in contact, between the<br>
layer of the multilayer body and the transparency body,<br>
it is additionally possible to achieve homogenization<br>
of the lateral temperature distribution.<br>
In a particular configuration, the transparency body<br>
and/or the spacer includes a material which is selected<br>
from the group consisting of glass and/or glass-<br>
ceramic. Glass-ceramic has various advantages:<br>
• It can be used for annealing within a wide<br>
temperature range from, for example, 0°C to, for<br>
example, 700°C. Glass-ceramic has, by way of example,<br>
a softening point which lies above the temperature<br>
range.<br>
• It has a very low coefficient of thermal expansion.<br>
It is able to withstand thermal shocks and is free of<br>
distortion within the abovementioned temperature<br>
range for the annealing.<br>
• It is chemically inert with respect to a wide range<br>
of chemicals and is relatively impermeable to these<br>
chemicals. A chemical of this type is, for example,<br>
the process gas to which a layer and/or the entire<br>
multilayer body is exposed during the annealing.<br>
• It is optically semi transparent in the spectral<br>
region of numerous energy sources for electromagnetic<br>
radiation, in particular in a wavelength region in<br>
which a radiation density from the energy sources is<br>
high. A radiation source of this type is, for<br>
example, a halogen lamp with a high radiation density<br>
between 0.1 and 4.5 µm.<br>
Glass, in particular quartz glass, are also conceivable<br>
for use as materials for the transparency body. The<br>
advantage of glass is that it can be used at high<br>
temperatures of up to 1 200°C. These materials have a<br>
high transmission and low absorption in the spectral<br>
region of an energy source in the form of a halogen<br>
lamp. The light passes through this transparency body<br>
substantially without obstacle and passes to a layer<br>
with a corresponding absorption for the electromagnetic<br>
radiation, the layer taking up a quantity of energy and<br>
being heated. The transparency body is scarcely heated<br>
by the radiation.<br>
In one process application, it is possible for material<br>
of the heated layer to be evaporated and deposited on a<br>
relatively cold surface of the transparency body. To<br>
prevent this, it is possible to ensure that the<br>
transparency body is heated to a required temperature<br>
during the annealing. This is achieved by transferring<br>
a quantity of energy to the transparency body by heat<br>
conduction and/or convection. Electromagnetic radiation<br>
which the transparency body absorbs is also<br>
conceivable. It is conceivable for the transparency<br>
body to have a coating which absorbs a certain<br>
proportion of the electromagnetic radiation. The energy<br>
which is taken up as a result can be transmitted to the<br>
transparency body made from glass or quartz glass. In<br>
this form, the transparency body, comprising the glass<br>
body with the coating, is optically semi transparent and<br>
can be used to transmit energy to the multilayer body<br>
both by heat radiation and by heat conduction.<br>
In a particular configuration of the invention, at<br>
least one layer can be brought into contact with a<br>
process gas. It is also conceivable for the entire<br>
multilayer body to be exposed to the process gas.<br>
During the annealing, the process gas acts on the layer<br>
or on individual layers or on the entire multilayer<br>
body and is involved in the change in the physical and<br>
chemical properties of the multilayer body. An example<br>
of a suitable process gas is an inert gas (molecular<br>
nitrogen or noble gas) . The process gas does not react<br>
with a material of the layer. However, a process gas<br>
which does react with a material of the layer is also<br>
conceivable. The functional layer forms under the<br>
action of the process gas. By way of example, the<br>
process gas has an oxidizing or reducing action with<br>
respect to a material of the layer. Possible process<br>
gases for this purpose are oxygen, chlorine, hydrogen,<br>
elemental selenium, sulfur or a hydride. It may also be<br>
an etching<br>
process gas, such as HCl or the like. Further examples<br>
of the process gas are H2S and H2Se, which are used for<br>
the production of a thin-film solar cell (cf. below) .<br>
Finally, all gases or gas mixtures which react with a<br>
material of a layer in a suitable way are conceivable.<br>
It is advantageous if the layer is exposed to a defined<br>
process-gas atmosphere. The defined process-gas<br>
atmosphere comprises, for example, a partial pressure<br>
of the process gas or gases during the annealing. By<br>
way of example, it is also conceivable for a layer or<br>
the multilayer body to be in contact with vacuum in<br>
order for annealing to be carried out.<br>
A defined process-gas atmosphere can be achieved, for<br>
example, by guiding the process gas past the layer at a<br>
defined velocity. During the annealing, a process gas<br>
with various partial pressures can act on the layer. It<br>
is also conceivable for various process gases to be in<br>
contact with the layer of the layer body in succession.<br>
Preferably, at least the layer which is in contact with<br>
the process gas is enclosed. This is achieved, for<br>
example, by sheathing the layer, it being possible for<br>
the sheathing to be secured to the substrate layer. The<br>
sheathing is filled with the process gas before or<br>
during the annealing. The process gas is in the process<br>
concentrated on a surface of the layer whose properties<br>
are to be influenced by the process gas. In this way,<br>
it is possible to prevent a surrounding area from being<br>
contaminated by the process gas. This is particularly<br>
important when using a corrosive and/or toxic process<br>
gas. Moreover, it is possible to operate with a<br>
stoichiometric quantity of process gas which is<br>
required for conversion of the layer. There is no<br>
unnecessary consumption of process gas.<br>
In a particular configuration of the invention, there<br>
is a container for holding the multilayer body during<br>
the annealing. The transparency body is in particular a<br>
wall of the container. The container has the advantage<br>
that it automatically forms the sheathing of the layer<br>
or of the entire multilayer body. The sheathing does<br>
not need to be secured to the multilayer body. In the<br>
case of a closeable container, the process-gas<br>
atmosphere can be set specifically and easily. In<br>
particular, for this purpose the container has at least<br>
one gas opening for evacuation of the container and/or<br>
filling of the container with the process gas. In a<br>
particular embodiment, the gas opening is produced by<br>
an automatically closeable valve. The process-gas<br>
atmosphere can be set actively. The gas opening can<br>
also be used in order to fill the container with any<br>
desired gas, for example a purge gas. The process-gas<br>
atmosphere may also be set or adjusted during the<br>
annealing.<br>
To specifically set the process-gas atmosphere,<br>
however, it is also possible for the container to have<br>
a sufficiently large volume for the process gas<br>
required during the annealing. If the annealing<br>
requires a homogeneous and reproducible distribution of<br>
the process gas over a layer, it is also possible to<br>
specifically establish a gas discharge from the<br>
container. This may be required, for example, if<br>
annealing is carried out at a very high heating rate.<br>
In this case, the process gas expands. If the container<br>
is unable to withstand the gas pressure which occurs as<br>
a result, the container will be deformed or even<br>
destroyed. However, deformation should be prevented,<br>
for example, if the multilayer body is resting on the<br>
base of the container. As described above, deformation<br>
of the container leads to lateral temperature<br>
inhomogeneity in the multilayer body, with the<br>
corresponding consequences.<br>
Moreover, the container may be means for conveying the<br>
multilayer body during the annealing. The container has<br>
the advantage that, during the annealing, it is not<br>
possible, for example, to rule out the possibility of a<br>
layer (substrate layer) of glass breaking. In the event<br>
of a substrate of this type breaking, the broken<br>
material can easily be removed from an installation for<br>
annealing the multilayer body. This contributes to<br>
stabilizing the process in the annealing installation.<br>
In a particular configuration, the wall of the<br>
container which includes the transparency body is a<br>
cover and/or a base of the container. By way of<br>
example, one layer of the multilayer body rests<br>
directly on the transparency body of the base. As<br>
described above, the transparency body may have<br>
spacers. The cover likewise includes the transparency<br>
body which, by way of example, is not in contact with<br>
the multilayer body or a layer of the multilayer body.<br>
In this way, the layer of the multilayer body which<br>
rests on the base can be heated by heat conduction, and<br>
the layer which faces the cover can be heated by heat<br>
radiation. The layer facing the cover can easily be<br>
exposed to a process gas.<br>
However, the cover of the container can also be<br>
characterized by high absorption of the electromagnetic<br>
radiation which is emitted by an energy source.<br>
In a further configuration, the base and/or the cover<br>
of the container is formed by in each case at least one<br>
multilayer body. In this case, the layer of the<br>
multilayer body which, for example, is to come into<br>
contact with a process gas is directed into an interior<br>
of the container. This solution is possible if the<br>
multilayer body or the layers of the multilayer body<br>
have a low coefficient of thermal expansion and/or the<br>
annealing rate is low. In the case of a high annealing<br>
rate, the multilayer<br>
body advantageously has a substrate layer with a high<br>
coefficient of thermal conductivity. The substrate<br>
layer is directed outward. By way of example, in this<br>
case the substrate layer is a transparency body as<br>
described above.<br>
With the container, the apparatus is suitable in<br>
particular for carrying out the annealing in an in-line<br>
process with various process stages which are carried<br>
out in different process zones.<br>
In the in-line process, the container can be conveyed<br>
either continuously or discontinuously. In the case of<br>
the continuous in-line process, the material being<br>
processed or the processing container is moved through<br>
the processing installation throughout the entire<br>
passage. The discontinuous or indexing mode of the<br>
in-line process is characterized in that the processing<br>
box or the material being processed is moving only<br>
during its transfer from one process zone into the<br>
next, remaining in the process stage until the sub-<br>
process has been concluded. In this case, it is<br>
advantageous for the transfer time to be as short as<br>
possible when compared to the residence time. The<br>
material or box is then conveyed onward into the next<br>
process zone, followed by a further residence time,<br>
etc. In the case of in-line installations which are<br>
designed for indexing operation, it is advantageous for<br>
each process zone to be at least of the size of a<br>
processing vessel, so that the homogeneity of a process<br>
zone (for example the temperature) can be transferred<br>
to the material being processed. In a further<br>
configuration, all the processing zones which are fed<br>
by indexing operation have the same dimensions, as seen<br>
in the conveying direction. Consequently, simple<br>
conveyor mechanisms, such as a conveyor chain, a<br>
conveyor belt or pusher conveying, can be used to<br>
simultaneously load and unload, in indexing mode, not<br>
just one process zone, but rather all adjacent process<br>
zones.<br>
By way of example, the multilayer body is placed into<br>
the container. The container is used to transport the<br>
multilayer body from process stage to process stage or<br>
from process zone to process zone. Each process stage,<br>
for example heating, cooling, evacuation or filling of<br>
the container, can be carried out in a dedicated<br>
process zone. In a first process stage, the container<br>
is filled with, for example, a process gas. The<br>
container can be introduced into a chamber which is<br>
provided specifically for that purpose, where it can be<br>
evacuated, filled with a corresponding process gas and<br>
closed. A separate inlet and outlet (gas opening) in<br>
the container for purging or filling the container with<br>
the process gas is possible. This gas opening can be<br>
connected to a coupling unit and positioning unit in<br>
order for the processing box to be filled with gas or<br>
evacuated. The coupling unit is used, for example, to<br>
connect the container, in an in-line process, for<br>
example in indexing mode, in order for a process stage<br>
to be carried out at a specific location (process<br>
zone), to a corresponding unit {e.g. vacuum pump, gas<br>
cylinder) in such a manner that the container can be<br>
filled with the corresponding gas or emptied.<br>
In a particular configuration, the container has a<br>
coupling unit allowing the container to be arranged in<br>
a process zone. With the aid of the coupling unit, it<br>
is possible to hold or position the container in a<br>
process zone. For this purpose, by way of example, the<br>
process zone likewise has a coupling unit. The coupling<br>
unit is used, for example, to hold the container at a<br>
specific location (process zone) in an in-line process<br>
for carrying out a process stage and to connect it to a<br>
corresponding unit (e.g. vacuum pump, gas cylinder), in<br>
such a manner that the container can be filled with the<br>
corresponding gas or the container can be emptied. The<br>
coupling unit of the container and the coupling unit of<br>
the process zone function, for example, according to<br>
the key/hole principle.<br>
It is also conceivable for the container to be conveyed<br>
from process zone to process zone with the aid of the<br>
coupling unit.<br>
The following process sequence is conceivable: in a<br>
first process stage, the container is filled, for<br>
example, with a process gas. The container can be<br>
introduced into a chamber which is present specifically<br>
for this purpose, where it can be evacuated, filled<br>
with a corresponding process gas and closed. A separate<br>
inlet and outlet (gas opening) of the container for<br>
purging and filling the container with the process gas<br>
is also possible. In particular, the gas opening of the<br>
container has a coupling unit for coupling the<br>
container to a coupling unit of a process zone.<br>
This gas opening can be used as a coupling unit and/or<br>
positioning unit. The annealing takes place in a second<br>
process stage. For this purpose, the container is<br>
conveyed out of the chamber into a heating zone. After<br>
the annealing has ended, the multilayer body is<br>
conveyed out of the heating zones into the cooling<br>
zones in order for a further process stage to be<br>
carried out.<br>
The conveying in the in-line process takes place, for<br>
example, by passing a multiplicity of containers<br>
containing multilayer bodies through the in-line<br>
installation in the form of a train. The entire train<br>
is set in motion by the pushing action of one<br>
container. The containers are moved simultaneously.<br>
This type of conveying is known as a "pusher drive". In<br>
this case, the conveying advantageously takes place in<br>
"indexing mode".<br>
In a particular configuration, the apparatus is<br>
arranged in a processing chamber which is selected from<br>
the group consisting of a vacuum chamber, an<br>
atmospheric chamber and/or a high-pressure chamber. An<br>
entire in-line installation may be integrated within<br>
the processing chamber. By way of example, a heating or<br>
cooling zone is accessible to the container<br>
containing the multilayer body through a lock or is<br>
separated from a further process zone in the processing<br>
chamber by such a lock. In particular, it is<br>
conceivable for there to be a plurality of processing<br>
chambers, for example a heating zone with a single-<br>
walled processing chamber, a cooling zone with a<br>
double-walled chamber which is water-cooled. The<br>
container is used to transport the multilayer body from<br>
processing chamber to processing chamber.<br>
In a particular configuration, the transparency body<br>
and/or the energy transmitter and/or the container<br>
and/or the processing chamber includes a material which<br>
is inert with respect to a process gas. Moreover, it is<br>
advantageous for an entire annealing process area to be<br>
inert with respect to the process gas used. The process<br>
area also includes, for example, the energy source<br>
(primary energy source).<br>
The material is selected according to the process gas.<br>
By way of example, glass, glass-ceramic and ceramic are<br>
conceivable. It is also possible to use a fiber-<br>
reinforced material, such as carbon-fiber-reinforced<br>
graphite. A material such as SiC, which has a high<br>
coefficient of thermal conductivity, is also<br>
conceivable. The container and/or the processing<br>
chamber may be completely or partially made up of a.<br>
metal or an alloy. A plastic which is unaffected up to<br>
a defined temperature is also possible.<br>
In addition to being chemically inert with respect to<br>
the process gas, the following properties are also<br>
advantageous for the material of the container:<br>
• The material of the container is free from distortion<br>
under the annealing conditions. Moreover, it is able<br>
to withstand thermal shocks. This is the case in<br>
particular if it has a low coefficient of thermal<br>
expansion.<br>
• The thermal softening point of the material of the<br>
container is above a maximum temperature reached<br>
during the annealing.<br>
• The container has a low or defined permeability with<br>
respect to a process gas.<br>
In a particular configuration, there is a device for<br>
detecting a measurement of at least one physical<br>
parameter of the apparatus, which is dependent on the<br>
annealing, for controlling the first and second partial<br>
quantities of the quantity of energy.<br>
A possible parameter is an absorption, transmission<br>
and/or reflection property of a layer. The measurement<br>
of the parameter is the value of the parameter. By way<br>
of example, a wavelength of an absorption maximum may<br>
be dependent on the temperature. In this case, the<br>
measurement of the parameter would be the corresponding<br>
wavelength.<br>
In particular, the parameter is a temperature of the<br>
multilayer body. The measurement is in this case a<br>
value of the temperature. Detection of the temperature<br>
of a layer of the multilayer body, of the transparency<br>
body and/or of the container or of a wall of the<br>
container is also conceivable. During the annealing, it<br>
is always possible for at least one parameter of the<br>
multilayer body and/or of a layer to be detected. By<br>
way of example, the partial quantity of the quantity of<br>
energy which is taken up by the layer is increased or<br>
reduced on the basis of the detected temperature of a<br>
layer. In this way, temperature inhomogeneity or a<br>
temperature gradient in the thickness direction of the<br>
multilayer body can be avoided. However, if necessary,<br>
this temperature homogeneity can also be increased.<br>
By way of example, the device for detecting the<br>
temperature is a pyrometer which is directed onto the<br>
layer. By way of example, the pyrometer detects the<br>
thermal radiation<br>
which is emitted by the layer. The temperature of the<br>
layer can be established on the basis of the thermal<br>
radiation. A temperature detector which is connected to<br>
the layer and the temperature of which is controlled by<br>
heat conduction is also conceivable.<br>
It is also conceivable for the temperature of the layer<br>
or of the multilayer body to be measured not directly<br>
but rather indirectly. By way of example, a pyrometer<br>
is directed onto the container in which the multilayer<br>
body is being annealed. The temperature of the<br>
container may be influenced by the temperature of the<br>
multilayer body. The temperature of the layer of the<br>
multilayer body can be worked out from the temperature<br>
of the container. The quantity of energy or the partial<br>
quantity of the quantity of energy is controlled on the<br>
basis of the measured container temperature. For this<br>
purpose, for example prior to the annealing, a type of<br>
"calibration measurement" is to be carried out,<br>
representing a relationship between the measured<br>
temperature of the container and the actual temperature<br>
of the layer or of the layer body. The "calibration<br>
measurement" indicates a desired value for the<br>
temperature. The actual value is detected. A comparison<br>
between desired value and actual value supplies a<br>
control variable for controlling the quantities of<br>
energy.<br>
The detection (and also the control of the partial<br>
quantities of the quantity of energy) takes place in<br>
particular with a local resolution in the thickness<br>
direction of the multilayer body and with a temporal<br>
resolution within the time frame of the annealing. By<br>
way of example, the multilayer body is heated at an<br>
annealing rate of 25°C/s. Then, both the detection and<br>
the control of the partial quantities of the quantity<br>
of energy would take place so quickly that a<br>
temperature difference between the layers of the<br>
multilayer body during annealing remains, for example,<br>
below a prescribed maximum.<br>
The temperature inhomogeneity in the thickness<br>
direction may, in combination with a transient<br>
deformation of the multilayer body,<br>
also lead to a lateral temperature inhomogeneity in the<br>
multilayer body. Lateral means, for example, within a<br>
layer of the multilayer body perpendicular to the<br>
thickness direction. As described in the introduction,<br>
the multilayer body, during the annealing, rests, for<br>
example, on a base made from graphite. The supply or<br>
uptake of the quantity of energy by the layer of the<br>
multilayer body which rests on the base takes place<br>
through heat conduction. Transient deformation of the<br>
multilayer body in the form of bending of the<br>
multilayer body may occur as a result of temperature<br>
inhomogeneity in the thickness direction. In the<br>
process, the contact between the multilayer body and<br>
the base of the container which is required for the<br>
heat conduction is partially detached. This leads to a<br>
lateral temperature inhomogeneity of the resting layer<br>
or of the multilayer body. Therefore, it is<br>
particularly advantageous if there is a local<br>
resolution not only in the thickness direction but also<br>
laterally, in order for the parameter to be detected<br>
(and the quantities of energy to be controlled).<br>
In one particular configuration, the parameter is a<br>
deformation of the multilayer body. Deformation may<br>
occur as a result of a temperature inhomogeneity being<br>
present. By way of example, the multilayer body is<br>
curved concavely. The multilayer body rests on the base<br>
of, for example, a container. Concave deformation<br>
results in a distance between the bearing surface and<br>
the multilayer body forming in the edge region of the<br>
multilayer body. A measurement of a deformation of this<br>
type can be detected, for example, using a laser<br>
interferometry or laser light reflection device. The<br>
quantities of energy are controlled on the basis of the<br>
measurement. It is advantageous if the measurement is<br>
recognized during an early stage of the deformation and<br>
can be reacted to quickly.<br>
For an abovementioned device for detecting a<br>
measurement of a parameter which is dependent on the<br>
annealing with the aid of an optical device (e.g.<br>
laser), it is advantageous<br>
if the layer which is to be examined is accessible to<br>
light from the optical device and a detection signal<br>
can be unambiguously assigned to the parameter which is<br>
to be detected. The wavelength of a laser should, for<br>
example, differ sufficiently from the thermal radiation<br>
of the multilayer body. If the apparatus is equipped<br>
with a container, it would be advantageous if the<br>
transparency body is sufficiently transparent to the<br>
light of the laser.<br>
With the aid of the apparatus, it is also possible to<br>
achieve a desired deformation of the multilayer body.<br>
For this purpose, it may also be appropriate to monitor<br>
the deformation during the annealing in the manner<br>
described above. By way of example, it is possible to<br>
produce a curved thin-film solar cell. To achieve<br>
controlled deformation, by way of example the<br>
multilayer body is laid onto a corresponding mold or<br>
mask. The mold or mask may itself be an energy source.<br>
The multilayer body is heated to above a softening<br>
point of the substrate layer. As a result, the<br>
multilayer body adopts a shape which corresponds to<br>
that of the mask or of the mold. The mask is, for<br>
example, integrated in a base of the container. The<br>
mask could, for example, be the transparency body.<br>
A second aspect of the invention provides a process for<br>
annealing a multilayer body which has a first layer and<br>
at least one second layer, through uptake of a quantity<br>
of energy by the multilayer body involving uptake of a<br>
first partial quantity of the quantity of energy by the<br>
first layer and uptake of a second partial quantity of<br>
the quantity of energy by the second layer, at least<br>
one energy source being used to supply the quantity of<br>
energy to the multilayer body. In this process, in<br>
particular an apparatus as described above is used. The<br>
process steps comprise: arranging the multilayer body<br>
between a first energy source and at least one second<br>
energy source, so that the first layer is arranged<br>
between the first energy source and the second layer,<br>
and the second layer is arranged between the<br>
second energy source and the first layer, the energy<br>
source used being at least one energy source for<br>
providing a defined electromagnetic radiation with a<br>
radiation field, and at least one of the layers<br>
absorbing the electromagnetic radiation and being<br>
arranged lin the radiation field of the energy source,<br>
and arranging a transparency body in the radiation<br>
field of the energy source between the energy source<br>
and the layer which lies in the radiation field of the<br>
energy source and absorbs the defined electromagnetic<br>
radiation, and annealing the multilayer body.<br>
In a particular configuration, the transparency body<br>
absorbs a certain quantity of energy and supplies the<br>
quantity of energy to the layer. This takes place in<br>
particular through heat conduction and/or heat<br>
radiation from the transparency body to the layer.<br>
In a particular configuration, at least one layer is<br>
brought into contact with a process gas. This takes<br>
place before, during and/or after the annealing. It is<br>
possible for not just one layer, but the entire<br>
multilayer body to be brought into contact with the<br>
process gas.<br>
In a further configuration, detection of a measurement,<br>
which is dependent on the annealing, of a physical<br>
parameter of the multilayer body is carried out during<br>
the annealing, in order to control the uptake of the<br>
quantity of energy during the annealing and to control<br>
the first and second partial quantities of the quantity<br>
of energy. In a particular configuration, the<br>
transparency body supplies the quantity of energy the<br>
layer by heat conduction and/or heat radiation.<br>
In a particular configuration, the process is carried<br>
out as a process stage in an in-line process and/or a<br>
quasi-in-line process comprising at least two process<br>
stages. Each of the process stages is<br>
carried out at a separate location (process zone). In<br>
particular, the above-described apparatus with the<br>
container is used to transport the multilayer body from<br>
process zone to process zone. The process stages may,<br>
for example, be heating zones or cooling zones, which<br>
may be equipped with coupling units in order for the<br>
vessels to be filled with gas or emptied. The process<br>
stages may be connected to one another by a surrounding<br>
processing chamber. The surrounding enclosure may, for<br>
example, be a vacuum chamber, an atmospheric pressure<br>
chamber or a high-pressure chamber. Furthermore, the<br>
process stages may be provided, at the inlet and<br>
outlet, with vacuum or high-pressure locks for the<br>
material being processed.<br>
A further aspect of the invention provides a multilayer<br>
body, having a first layer comprising at least one<br>
substance selected from the group consisting of copper,<br>
indium, gallium, sulfur and/or selenium, and a second<br>
layer comprising glass, a lateral diameter of the<br>
multilayer body being selected from the range between<br>
0.3 m and 5 m. The diameter is preferably over 1.0 m up<br>
to 5 m.<br>
In a particular configuration, the multilayer body is<br>
produced by the process process described above. At<br>
least one substance in the first layer of the<br>
multilayer body is selected from the group consisting<br>
of copper, indium, gallium, sulfur and selenium, and a<br>
second layer comprising glass is used. The lateral<br>
diameter (dimension) of the multilayer body is selected<br>
from the range between 0.3 m and 5 m. The layer is, for<br>
example, a copper/indium selenide semiconductor layer.<br>
The multilayer body described is, for example, a thin-<br>
film solar cell or a thin-film solar module, which<br>
comprises a multiplicity of individual thin-film solar<br>
cells connected in series. The glass is preferably<br>
soda-lime glass. The<br>
corresponding layer functions as a substrate layer. A<br>
molybdenum layer is applied to the substrate layer as<br>
an electrode, and a functional layer, namely a copper/<br>
indium/gallium/sulfo-selenide (CIGSSe) semiconductor<br>
layer, is applied on top of the molybdenum layer. A<br>
thickness of the layer body, comprising glass body and<br>
semiconductor layer, is typically 2 to 4 mm, with a<br>
molybdenum layer of approx. 0.5 µm and a semiconductor<br>
layer of approx. 3 µm. The range given for the<br>
thickness of the multilayer body is not exclusive. The<br>
limiting factor is the ability to produce a large<br>
substrate which is as planar as possible and therefore<br>
can be processed using the apparatus described or using<br>
the process described in order to produce a multilayer<br>
body.<br>
To summarize, the invention results in the following<br>
advantages:<br>
• A large-area multilayer body with an asymmetric layer<br>
structure (e.g. multilayer body with a single layer<br>
on a substrate layer) using a high annealing rate of<br>
over 1°C/s is possible.<br>
• The layers of the multilayer body may have a greatly<br>
varying coefficient of thermal conductivity.<br>
• Annealing takes place particularly reliably through<br>
temporal and local resolution of the detection and of<br>
the control of a measurement of a parameter which is<br>
dependent on the annealing.<br>
• Annealing is possible up to almost a softening point<br>
of a substrate layer.<br>
• Permanent deformation of the multilayer body is<br>
possible when annealing at over the softening point<br>
of the substrate layer.<br>
• The use of a container allows a defined annealing<br>
environment with a defined process-gas atmosphere to<br>
be created. In particular, a toxic and/or corrosive<br>
process gas can be used.<br>
• The process can be carried out in an in-line<br>
installation with a high throughput.<br>

In the exemplary embodiments, a thin-film solar module<br>
1 is being produced. The thin-film solar module has a<br>
basic surface area of 850 x 600 mm2. The thickness of<br>
the solar module is 3 mm, a 0.5 p thick layer of<br>
molybdenum 3 and a 0.5 µm thick copper/indium/gallium/<br>

produced on a substrate layer comprising soda-lime<br>
glass 2.<br>

following layer structure: soda-lime glass/molybdenum/<br>
copper(gallium)/indium/selenium. Soda-lime glass<br>
functions as a substrate layer 2 for the molybdenum<br>
layer 3 and the multiple layer 4. Gallium is<br>
incorporated in the copper layer. A gas mixture<br>
comprising hydrogen sulfide, helium and hydrogen is<br>
used as process gas 16. Gaseous selenium or hydrogen<br>
gelenide is formed during the annealing.<br>
According to a first embodiment, the multilayer body is<br>
placed onto a transparency body 5 made from glass-<br>
ceramic (Figure 1) . The transparency body has a<br>
multiplicity of spacers 6 made from the same material<br>
as that which forms the transparency body 5 (Figure 4) .<br>
The transparency body 5 is situated between the<br>
substrate layer 2 of the thin-film solar module or its<br>
starting form 1 and an energy source 7. The energy<br>
source 7 comprises a plurality of arrays of halogen<br>
lamps arranged adjacent to one another to form a<br>
matrix. The matrix supplies<br>
a homogeneous radiation field 8. The transparency body<br>
5 is situated in the radiation field 8 of the energy<br>
source 7. It absorbs some of the electromagnetic<br>
radiation 9 from the energy source and transmits the<br>
quantity of energy absorbed to the substrate layer 2<br>
through heat conduction 10. The glass layer 2 is<br>
annealed primarily through the heat conduction 10.<br>
A second transparency body 12 comprising glass-ceramic<br>
is arranged between a second energy source 11 and the<br>
selenium layer (outermost coating of the layer 4). The<br>
second energy source 11 is designed, just like the<br>
first energy source 11, as a matrix. The second<br>
transparency body 12 absorbs some of the electro-<br>
magnetic radiation 13 from the second energy source 11.<br>
Some of the quantity of energy which is taken up in the<br>
process is released to the multiple layer 4 in the form<br>
of heat radiation 14. The transparency body 12 also<br>
transmits electromagnetic radiation 13, so that this<br>
radiation impinges on the multiple layer 4. The<br>
multiple layer 4 lies in the radiation field 15 of the<br>
energy source 13. The multiple layer 4 is annealed<br>
primarily through heat radiation 14.<br>
The multilayer body 1 is arranged in a container 17 in<br>
the manner described above (Figure 2). The cover 18 and<br>
the base 19 are formed by the transparency bodies 5 and<br>
12. A side wall 20 of the container 17 consists of<br>
carbon fiber-reinforced carbon (CFC).<br>
After the multilayer body has been laid on the base-<br>
plate, the container is filled with the process gas and<br>
closed. The annealing then takes place at an annealing<br>
rate of 5°C/s, the energy source 7 and 11 being<br>
controlled separately.<br>
A further exemplary embodiment is distinguished by the<br>
fact that an energy transmitter 26 is integrated in the<br>
box (Figure 3).<br>
The following control circuit is used for the energy<br>
source 7: a lateral actual temperature profile of the<br>
transparency body 5 is measured using a pyrometer in<br>
the form of an infrared sensor of suitable wavelength.<br>
The contact with the multilayer body means that the<br>
temperature profile of the substrate layer 2 can be<br>
determined from the temperature profile of the<br>
transparency body by means of calibration. A control<br>
signal, which is used to control the radiation output<br>
of the energy source 7, is determined by a control<br>
algorithm via actual and desired values of the<br>
temperature of the transparency body.<br>
A control variable for a control circuit for<br>
controlling the energy source 11 is a transient bending<br>
21 of the substrate layer 2. The bending 21 is measured<br>
by laser inter ferometry on the substrate side 22 or<br>
layer side 23. Measurement points are the substrate<br>
center 24 and a corner 25 of the multilayer body.<br>
During the laser interferometry, the change in distance<br>
caused by bending is measured and is used to determine<br>
the control signal for the associated energy source.<br>
In a further exemplary embodiment, the control variable<br>
for the energy source 11 is the temperature of the<br>
transparency body 12.<br>
A further exemplary embodiment is indicated in<br>
Figure 7. The container 17 has gas openings in the form<br>
of a gas inlet 31 and a gas outlet 32. These openings<br>
have, for example, a closeable valve which is closed<br>
after the gas exchange has ended. While the container<br>
17 containing the multilayer body 1 is being conveyed<br>
to the next process zone, the valve remains closed. One<br>
of the process zones is a heating zone. The heating<br>
zone comprises two<br>
arrays of halogen lamps. The annealing apparatus is<br>
produced as a result of the container (with<br>
transparency body) being conveyed into the heating zone<br>
between the two arrays.<br>
A further exemplary embodiment is likewise indicated in<br>
Figure 7. In this case, the entire apparatus is in a<br>
processing chamber 30, which can be evacuated and<br>
filled with a specific gas.<br>
Figures 8a and 8b illustrate the principle of an<br>
in-line process using an in-line installation. In a<br>
first embodiment, the entire in-line installation is<br>
arranged in the processing chamber 30 (Figure 8a). The<br>
multilayer body 1 in the container 17 is conveyed 36<br>
from process zone 33 to process zone 34. A different<br>
process stage is carried out at each of the process<br>
zones. In process zone 33, the container 17 is filled<br>
with the process gas and heated. In process zone 34,<br>
the container 17 is evacuated and cooled.<br>
Alternatively, each of the process zones 33 and 34 is<br>
arranged in a dedicated, separate process chamber 301<br>
to 304 (Figure 8b). The in-line installation is divided<br>
between a plurality of process chambers. The process<br>
chambers are provided with locks, through which the<br>
containers pass into the process chambers.<br>
Figures 9a and 9b show how an arrangement for annealing<br>
or processing, including coupling unit, may be<br>
designed. Figure 9a shows a cross section through the<br>
container 17 in processing mode. The container 17 has a<br>
cover 18 in the form of a transparency body 12. The<br>
base 19 consists of highly absorbent material. In one<br>
embodiment, the material is graphite. A side wall 20 of<br>
the container 17 is a frame of the container 17 made<br>
from CFC. Gas inlet 31 and gas outlet 32 are integrated<br>
in the side wall of the container. Self-closing valves<br>
40 are likewise integrated in the side wall 20. These<br>
valves can be used to open and close the gas openings<br>
31<br>
and 32 for evacuating the container or filling the<br>
container with a gas.<br>
A coupling unit 42 of the container of the process zone<br>
33 is likewise integrated in the side wall. The<br>
coupling unit 42 may, for example, be designed as a<br>
conical opening. This opening is used to plug-connect<br>
the container 17 to a coupling unit 41, which is formed<br>
inversely with respect to the opening, of the process<br>
zones. Gas lines 43 are integrated in the coupling<br>
units 41 and 42. When the container has in this way<br>
been arranged with, for example, the process zone 33,<br>
by way of example any desired process gas can be<br>
introduced or discharged during this process stage, or<br>
the processing vessel can be evacuated and purged with<br>
inert gas. In the form illustrated, the coupling units<br>
42 of the container 17 and of the process zone 33 are<br>
used to produce a process-gas atmosphere.<br>
After the processing or annealing has ended, the<br>
coupling unit is pulled off and the valves 40 close<br>
automatically. Then, in conveying mode, the container<br>
can be conveyed to the next process zone 34. The zone<br>
34 may, for example, be provided with a further<br>
coupling unit, which, for example, tops up consumed<br>
processing gas or introduces a new processing gas.<br>
