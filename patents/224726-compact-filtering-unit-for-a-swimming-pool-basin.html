				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The invention relates to the technical field of<br>
water filtration for swinuning pools.<br>
Generally, the filtration is obtained by means of<br>
one or more filters which can be of various structures,<br>
the filters being fitted in combination with a water-<br>
suction and water-delivery circuit.<br>
Different solutions have been proposed to<br>
safeguard this function. More particularly, the<br>
invention relates to a compact unit comprising a<br>
filtration compartment in communication with the pool<br>
water and a pumping compartment situated outsjide the<br>
said pool.<br>
In a perfectly known manner, this unit constitutes<br>
a compact block fitted, for example, overlapping the<br>
panels or other constituent parts of the swimming pool<br>
wall. The water originating from the pool is sucked<br>
through at least one mouth, known as a SKIMMER,<br>
belonging to the filtration compartment submerged in<br>
the water. The water which is thus sucked up passes<br>
through a filtration member and is delivered into the<br>
swimming pool through frontal and/or lateral nozzles by<br>
means, generally, of a pump installed in the other<br>
compartment situated outside the pool.<br>
The filtration means can especially be constituted<br>
by a filter bag fitted detachably in a bowl or well<br>
constituted by a cylindrical sleeve mounted vertically<br>
in the compartment submerged in the water.<br>
This solution follows, for example, from the<br>
teaching of patent FR EP 0423043. The bottom of the<br>
cylinder is coupled up with a suction strainer of at<br>
least one pump situated in the external compartment.<br>
The communication between the bottom of the cylinder,<br>
beneath the filter bag, and the suction intake of the<br>
pump is effected by means of a pipeline, as follows,<br>
for example, from the teaching of patent FR 2799485.<br>
The connection of this suction pipeline with the<br>
bottom of the cylinder is relatively difficult to<br>
effect. It is necessary to provide for a specific<br>
arrangement of the bottom of the filtration<br>
compartment, requiring the installation of a sealing<br>
joint. Moreover, the cylindrical well must have bracing<br>
webs in view of the depression forces exerted by the<br>
water, whilst the filtration compartment must have<br>
means capable of ensuring the centring and maintenance<br>
of the said well.<br>
From this prior art, the problem which the<br>
invention sets out to resolve is to simplify and<br>
rationalize the production of the block unit,<br>
especially at the filtration compartment level, by<br>
eliminating, in particular, the use of a separate<br>
cylindrical well receiving the filtration member,<br>
thereby eliminating the drawback resulting from the<br>
linkage of the cylindrical pit with the suction<br>
pipeline.<br>
In order to resolve such a problem, a compact<br>
filtration unit has been devised and perfected that<br>
receives at least one filtration member and a<br>
compartment situated on the outside of the swimming<br>
pool and that receives at least one pump, which<br>
compartment is submerged in the water and has a mouth<br>
known as a skimmer for suction of the water by the pump<br>
through the filtration member and through the front<br>
and/or side nozzles for return of the filtered water to<br>
the swimming pool.<br>
According to the invention:<br>
- at least one receptacle is formed to extend<br>
directly from the bottom of the filtration<br>
compartment, delimiting a peripheral space in<br>
which a pipeline is formed;<br>
two spacer webs link the receptacle to the<br>
interior of the compartment over the entire height<br>
of the said receptacle, thus delimiting the<br>
pipeline;<br>
- the bottom has an opening (If) for communication<br>
with the pipeline;<br>
the upper end of the pipeline fits onto means of<br>
connection to a suction intake of the pump.<br>
These features mean that the bottom of the<br>
receptacle holding the filtration member no longer has<br>
to be connected to a separate pipeline.<br>
In order to resolve the posed problem of the<br>
connection of the receptacle with the suction intake,<br>
the connecting means for the pipeline are constituted<br>
by a fit-in cover jointed to the upper part of the said<br>
pipeline, the said cover having a connecting sleeve<br>
capable of receiving a pipe element coupled to a<br>
suction intake belonging to at least one pump mounted<br>
in the pumping compartment.<br>
In order to resolve the posed problem of allowing<br>
for the pressures exerted by the water, the receptacle<br>
is linked to the interior of the compartment by<br>
vertical bracing webs.<br>
Advantageously, the receptacle has, above the<br>
communication opening with the suction pipeline, a pre-<br>
filtration element in the form of a screen.<br>
According to an advantageous realization, the<br>
receptacle is constituted by a cylindrical body formed<br>
directly from the bottom of the filtration compartment,<br>
delimiting a peripheral space in which the bracing webs<br>
and the suction pipeline are formed. The filtration<br>
means is constituted by a filter bag disposed inside<br>
the receptacle and fixed, removably, at the level of<br>
the opening of the said receptacle.<br>
In view of the fundamental characteristics of the<br>
invention, in a preferred embodiment the filtration and<br>
pumping compartments are linked by an element serving<br>
as a frame, so as to be situated on either side of the<br>
considered wall of the swimming pool, the filtration<br>
compartment being submerged in the water, while the<br>
pumping compartment is buried in the ground.<br>
The frame has fittings for the passage of the<br>
suction and delivery pipes between the two pumping and<br>
filtration compartments.<br>
The frame receives a cover, in two parts, in order<br>
to gain separate access to each of the filtration and<br>
pumping compartments.<br>
In view of the posed problem of significantly<br>
reducing the production costs, each compartment is<br>
obtained by injection of a plastics material.<br>
The invention is described in greater detail with<br>
reference to the figures of the accompaying ings, in<br>
which:<br>
Figures 1 and 2 are perspective views of a non-<br>
limiting embodiment of the compact filtration<br>
block according to the characteristics of the<br>
invention,<br>
Figure 3 is a view in longitudinal section of<br>
the block unit,<br>
Figure 4 is a top view corresponding to Figure<br>
3, the cover of the filtration compartment<br>
being removed,<br>
Figures 5 and 6 are cross-sectional views,<br>
viewed respectively along the lines 5-5 and 6-6<br>
of Figure 3.<br>
As illustrated, Figures 1 and 2 show an indicative<br>
and in no way limiting example of the compact<br>
filtration unit for a swimming pool. This unit<br>
comprises a compartment (1) submerged in the water and<br>
receiving a filtration means. In the remainder of the<br>
description, this compartment (1) is referred to as the<br>
filtration compartment. The compact unfit contains<br>
another compartment (2) situated outside the swimming<br>
pool, receiving a pumping means. In the remainder of<br>
the description, this compartment (2) is referred to as<br>
the pumping compartment.<br>
In a preferred embodiment and in view of the<br>
method of production of the filtration compartment (1),<br>
the two compartments (1) and (2) are mutually<br>
independent and are linked by an element (3) serving as<br>
a frame so as to be situated on either side of the<br>
considered wall of the swimming pool. The frame (3)<br>
receives a cover (4), in two parts (4a) and (4b), in<br>
order to gain separate access to the pumping<br>
compartment (2) and to the filtration compartment (1).<br>
In a known manner, the filtration compartment (1)<br>
submerged in the water has at least one suction mouth<br>
or «SKIMMER» (5), and at least one delivery nozzle (6)<br>
disposed laterally or facially.<br>
According to a fundamental characteristic of the<br>
invention, the filtration compartment (1) has directly,<br>
from its production, at least one receptacle (la)<br>
capable of receiving a filtration means (7), for<br>
example in the form of a filter bag. The receptacle<br>
(la) is situated beneath the suction mouth (5) to<br>
receive the water originating from the swimming pool,<br>
by suction, as will be indicated in the remainder of<br>
the description. To this end, the receptacle (la) is in<br>
communication, at its base, with fittings (lb) formed<br>
directly in the production of the filtration<br>
compartment (1) and capable of serving as a pipeline.<br>
The pipeline (lb) thus formed cooperates with<br>
connecting means (8) to the pumping compartment in<br>
order to suck the water through the filtration means<br>
(7) .<br>
The pipeline (lb) is formed by two webs (lbl)<br>
(Ib2) linking the receptacle (1) and the interior of<br>
the filtration compartment (1) over the full height of<br>
the said receptacle (la). The receptacle (la) is<br>
constituted by a cylindrical body formed directly from<br>
the bottom (lc) of the filtration compartment (1),<br>
delimiting a peripheral space (Id) in which bracing<br>
webs (le) and the pipeline (lb) are formed.<br>
The base of the cylindrical body (la) has a<br>
communication opening (If) with the pipeline (lb) . The<br>
upper end of the pipeline (lb) cooperates with the<br>
connecting means (8) in the form of a cover mounted in<br>
a leak-tight manner on the end of the said pipeline<br>
(lb) . The cover (8) has a connecting sleeve capable of<br>
receiving, in a leak-tight manner, a pipeline (9)<br>
coupled to the suction intake of the pumping means in<br>
the form of at least one pump (10).<br>
In view of these measures, the result is that the<br>
filtration compartment therefore has directly, from its<br>
production, the necessary internal fittings allowing<br>
the reception of the filtration means (7), whereby the<br>
installation of connecting pipelines is eliminated.<br>
The filtration means are advantageously<br>
constituted by a filter bag (7) disposed inside the<br>
cylinder (la) and fixed removably, by any known and<br>
appropriate means, at the level of the opening of the<br>
said cylinder. Following installation of the filter bag<br>
(7), the latter can receive in a known manner a pre-<br>
filtration element (11). It should be noted that the<br>
cylinder (la) can have above the opening (le) a pre-<br>
filtration element in the form of a screen (12).<br>
In view of the fundamental characteristics of the<br>
invention, each of the constituent elements of the<br>
block is obtained by a process of injection of a<br>
plastics material. This is especially the case with the<br>
filtration compartment (1), having, directly from the<br>
injection, the cylinder (la) and the pipeline (lb). The<br>
pumping compartment (2), the connecting frame (3) and<br>
the covers (4a) and (4b) can likewise be obtained by<br>
the injection process.<br>
Obviously, the pump (10) is linked by a pipeline<br>
(13) to the delivery nozzle (6) . The connecting frame<br>
(3) of the filtration compartment (la) and of the<br>
pumping compartment (2) has all types of appropriate<br>
fittings for the passage of the suction (9) and<br>
delivery (13) pipes between the two compartments (1)<br>
and (2).<br>
The working of the compact block filtration unit<br>
remains traditional. Following start-up of the pump(s)<br>
(10), the swimming pool water which enters through the<br>
SKIMMER (5) is sucked through the filter bag (7) by the<br>
pipeline (lb) connected at (8) to the pipeline (9). The<br>
water thus filtered is delivered by the pipeline (13)<br>
through the nozzle(s) (6).<br>
Obviously, the filtration compartment (1) has all<br>
types of outer fittings, of the floodlights (14), stair<br>
steps.... type.<br>
The advantages follow clearly from the invention,<br>
namely, by way of emphasis and reminder, the<br>
possibility of obtaining in a single operation the<br>
filtration compartment having internally all the<br>
necessary fittings allowing the installation of<br>
filtration members per se, whilst allowing a connection<br>
in the top part of the suction pipeline.<br>
