BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates generally to the casting of metals. More specifically, it<br>
relates to shell molds used in the casting of metal components, e.g.,<br>
components made from superalloys.<br>
The casting of metals is carried out by various techniques, such as<br>
investment casting. Ceramic shell molds are used during investment-casting,<br>
to contain and shape the metal in its molten state. The strength and integrity<br>
of the mold are very important factors in ensuring that the metal part has the<br>
proper dimensions. These shell mold characteristics are especially critical for<br>
manufacturing high performance components, such as superalloy parts used<br>
in the aerospace industry.<br>
Investment casting techniques often requir very high temperatures, e.g., in<br>
the range of about 1450°C to 1750°C. Many conventional shell molds do not<br>
exhibit sufficient strength at those temperatures. The molds become<br>
susceptible to bulging and cracking when they are filled with the molten<br>
metal. (Bulging can also occur when very large parts are being cast - even at<br>
lower temperatures). Bulging can alter the dimensions of the mold, thereby<br>
causing undesirable variation in the component being cast. Cracking could<br>
result in failure of the mold as the molten material runs out of it.<br>
Clearly, greater strength and dimensional stability are required for shell<br>
molds used at very high casting temperatures, or for those used to cast very<br>
large parts. The problem is addressed by J. Lane et al in U.S. Patent<br>
4,998,581. In that disclosure, shell molds are strengthened by wrapping a<br><br>
fibrous reinforcing material around the shell mold as it is being made. In<br>
preferred embodiments, the reinforcing material is said to be an alumina-<br>
based or mullite-based ceramic composition having a specific, minimum<br>
tensile strength. The reinforcing material is apparently wrapped in spiral<br>
fashion around the shell mold with a tension sufficient to keep it in place as<br>
ceramic layers are applied to the mold to build it up to its desired thickness.<br>
The Lane patent appears to provide answers to some of the problems<br>
described above. However, there appear to be some considerable<br>
disadvantages in practicing some embodiments of the invention disclosed in<br>
that patent. For example, mullite-based materials are difficult to produce<br>
without second phase inclusions of either silica- or alumina-containing<br>
compounds. These inclusions can degrade the physical properties of the<br>
mold. In addition, many of the reinforcing materials employed in U.S. Patent<br>
4,998,581 have thermal expansions much less than the mold. These large<br>
thermal expansion differences will make fabrication of a crack-free mold more<br>
difficult.<br>
It should thus be apparent that further improvements in the properties of shell<br>
molds used under the conditions described above would be welcome in the<br>
art. The shell molds should have the strength to withstand high metal-casting<br>
temperatures, and should be suitable for casting large parts. The molds<br>
should also be dimensionally stable at elevated temperatures, and<br>
throughout various heating/cooling cycles. Moreover, if the molds are to be<br>
improved by the use of reinforcing materials, such materials should be<br>
flexible enough, before being fired, to satisfy the shape requirements for the<br>
mold, especially when intricate metal components are being cast. Finally, the<br>
preparation of improved shell molds should be economically feasible, e.g.,<br>
not requiring the use of a significant amount of additional equipment. The<br>
use of the new molds should not result in undesirable increases in the cost<br>
for manufacturing metal parts in the investment casting process.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention satisfies many of the needs described above. In one<br>
aspect, the invention embodies a ceramic casting shell mold which has a pre-<br>
selected shape. The shell mold comprises repeating layers of a ceramic<br>
material which define the wall thickness and shape of the mold. A key feature<br>
of this embodiment is that at least one of the layers of ceramic material<br>
contains whiskers which provide structural reinforcement to the shell mold.<br>
The whiskers are formed of a refractory material, such as an alumina-based<br>
material.<br>
In preferred embodiments, the whiskers are incorporated into a layer of the<br>
ceramic material which is disposed at a position off-center of the wall-<br>
thickness of the mold, e.g., a slurry layer which is situated within about 10%<br>
to about 40% of the thickness from the inner wall of the mold. Frequently, at<br>
least two of the layers of ceramic material contain whiskers. In preferred<br>
embodiments, the whiskers in one of the adjacent layers are out of alignment<br>
with the whiskers in the other adjacent layer, e.g., are oriented at an angle of<br>
about 60 to about 90 degrees relative to the whiskers in the other adjacent<br>
layer.<br>
Another embodiment of this invention is directed to a method for making a<br>
ceramic casting shell mold, comprising the steps of:<br>
(I) applying a slurry which comprises ceramic-based whiskers to a<br>
ceramic layer-surface of a partial shell mold formed by applying successive<br>
ceramic layers over one another, forming a whisker-containing ceramic layer;<br>
(II) completing the shell mold so that it has a desired wall-thickness, by<br>
applying additional ceramic layers over the whisker-containing ceramic layer;<br>
and then<br><br>
(Ill) firing the shell mold at an elevated temperature.<br>
As described below, the whisker-containing ceramic layer is usually disposed<br>
at a position off-center of the wall-thickness of the mold. Moreover, more<br>
than one of the ceramic layers can contain whiskers. When whiskers are in<br>
multiple ceramic layers which are adjacent to one another, or relatively close<br>
to one another, the whiskers are preferably oriented so that they are out of<br>
alignment with the whiskers in adjacent or nearby layers.<br>
Shell molds prepared by the method of the present invention also constitute<br>
part of the present invention, as do metal- and metal alloy components cast in<br>
these shell molds. Examples of such components are turbine engine parts.<br>
Further details regarding the features of this invention are found in the<br>
remainder of the specification.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Shell molds are usually composed of refractory particles (e.g., refractory<br>
oxide particles) bonded together by a silica or phosphate gel. Examples o<br>
the typical refractory particles are alumina-based materials, aluminate-based<br>
materials (such as yttrium aluminate), or mixtures of these materials. Various<br>
patents describe many aspects of conventional shell-molding processes. The<br>
following are exemplary, and are all incorporated herein by reference: U.S.<br>
Patents 4,998,581 (Lane et al); 4,097,292 (Huseby et al); 4,086,311 (Huseby<br>
et al); 4,031,945 (Gigliotti, Jr. et al); 4,026,344 (Greskovich); 3,972,367<br>
(Gigliotti, Jr. et al); and 3,955,616 (Gigliotti, Jr. et al).<br>
One investment casting technique which is especially suitable for the present<br>
invention is the "lost wax" process. In one version of this technique, a wax<br>
pattern (i.e., a replica of the part being cast) is immersed repeatedly in a<br>
liquid slurry of refractory oxide (ceramic) particles in a silica- or phosphate-<br><br>
bearing binder. The particles typically have a spherical or tabular shape.<br>
Usually, the slurry is highly loaded with the ceramic solids, e.g., at least about<br>
40 volume percent, with the remainder being deionized water, an organic<br>
solvent, or a mixture thereof. Sufficient time is provided between immersions<br>
to allow the slurry coat to partially or completely dry on the wax. After a<br>
sufficient thickness of ceramic has built up on the wax, the wax is removed by<br>
various techniques, as discussed below. The completed mold is then fired,<br>
providing it with enough strength to withstand the casting process.<br>
Construction of the shell mold is usually carried out by applying a layer of the<br>
slurry to the wax pattern, followed by applying a layer of a stucco aggregate<br>
(e.g., made from commercially-available fused alumina) to the slurry layer,<br>
and then repeating the process a number of times. A typical chemical<br>
composition for a suitable slurry coat, after drying (and ignoring the stucco<br>
composition), includes about 80% to about 100% by weight of the alumina-<br>
based material, and about 20% to about 0% by weight of the binder material.<br>
Small amounts of other components are sometimes present, such as zircon.<br>
The number of times the layer-sequence is repeated will of course depend on<br>
the desired thickness of the mold. Usually, about 4 to about 20 total ceramic<br>
slurry layer/stucco layer pairs are used for the shell mold. For some end<br>
uses, about 10 to about 18 layer pairs are applied. (It should be noted that<br>
the number of individual layers of ceramic coating and ceramic stucco does<br>
not always correspond to the center of the wall thickness of the mold. This is<br>
due in part to variation in the thickness of the individual layers, e.g., because<br>
of variations in ceramic particle size.)<br>
In the present invention, at least one of the slurry layers comprises whiskers<br>
of refractory materials, e.g., refractory oxide materials. Examples of suitable<br>
refractory materials are those used in a typical shell mold slurry, and include<br>
alumina-based materials, aluminate-based materials (such as yttrium<br><br>
aluminate), silicon carbide-based materials, or any mixture of any of these<br>
materials. As used herein, the term "based" refers to the presence of the<br>
relevant material at a level of greater than about 50% by weight. Thus, these<br>
materials often contain other constituents as well, e.g., other ceramic oxides<br>
such as silicon dioxide, boron oxide, and the like. The use of whiskers is<br>
known in several arts, e.g., composite structures with plastics. Whiskers are<br>
technically referred to as "single axially-oriented crystal filaments", as<br>
described in The Condensed Chemical Dictionary, Tenth Edition, Van<br>
Nostrand Reinhold Company Inc., 1981, p. 1095, which is incorporated<br>
herein by reference.<br>
However, the present invention contemplates a broader definition of<br>
"whiskers". The term can include any fiber of refractory material which has<br>
an average diameter of about 5 to about 200 microns, and an aspect ratio of<br>
about 5 to about 300. In preferred embodiments, the average diameter of the<br>
whiskers is in the range of about 8 to about 120 microns. A preferred aspect<br>
ratio is about 10 to about 200. The whiskers can be made by chopping<br>
strands of the appropriate ceramic material. They are also available<br>
commercially, e.g., from 3M Company. In peferred embodiments, the<br>
material from which the whiskers are made should exhibit a coefficient of<br>
thermal expansion (CTE) which is within about 50% of the CTE of the shell<br>
mold layers in which they will be incorporated. In especially preferred<br>
embodiments, the CTE of the whisker-material is within about 30% of the<br>
CTE of the shell mold layers.<br>
The whiskers can fully replace the other ceramic particles in one or more<br>
slurry layers. Alternatively, the whiskers can replace a portion of the other<br>
ceramic particles. For example, a mixture of ceramic whiskers with the<br>
conventional ceramic ingredients, i.e., ceramic spheres and tabular ceramic<br>
particles, would be possible in many instances. The amount of whiskers<br>
employed will be determined by various factors, such as the composition of<br><br>
the whiskers; the shape and thickness of the mold; the required strength and<br>
dimensional stability of the mold; and the composition of the binder material<br>
and layer material in which the whiskers are being incorporated (as<br>
discussed below).<br>
The whiskers are usually incorporated into at least one of the secondary<br>
slurry layers. As used herein, the "primary" layer or coat is defined as one of<br>
the first two layers of slurry applied, i.e., as part of the alternating set of<br>
slurry/aggregated coatings. The "secondary" layer or coat is defined as any<br>
layer applied after the primary layers have been applied. The whiskers are<br>
sometimes incorporated into two or three successive layers.<br>
In some preferred embodiments, the whiskers are incorporated into one or<br>
more secondary slurry layers (sometimes adjacent to each other, i.e.,<br>
successively-applied) of the partially-formed shell mold which are off-center<br>
of the wall-thickness of the mold. The present inventors have discovered that<br>
such a position appears to result in enhanced mold strength. In especially<br>
preferred embodiments, the whiskers are incorporated into one or more slurry<br>
layers at a wall thickness as close as possible to the inner wall of the mold,<br>
without adversely affecting the cavity surface (e.g., without causing surface<br>
roughness). For example, the whiskers can be incorporated into slurry layers<br>
which are situated within about 10% to about 40% of the thickness from the<br>
inner wall of the mold, and most preferably, within about 10% to about 25% of<br>
the thickness from the inner wall of the mold.<br>
In other preferred embodiments, the whiskers are incorporated into one or<br>
more slurry layers (sometimes adjacent to each other) which are as close as<br>
possible to the outer wall of the mold, e.g., within about 10% to about 25% of<br>
the thickness from the outer wall. (Incorporation of the whiskers in a slurry<br>
layer which is too close to the outer wall may not provide the desired strength<br>
to the interior regions of the mold). In determining the most appropriate<br><br>
position for the whiskers, those skilled in the art can vary the position of the<br>
whiskers, and then evaluate the resulting physical properties of the mold,<br>
based on the teachings herein.<br>
As mentioned above, the whiskers can be incorporated into more than one of<br>
the slurry layers. Moreover, they can be incorporated into more than one<br>
position within the thickness of the mold. As an example, whiskers can first<br>
be incorporated into one or more slurry layers which coincide with about 10%<br>
to about 40% of the thickness from the inner wall of the mold. Then, as the<br>
mold is built up, whiskers can also be incorporated into one or more slurry<br>
layers closer to the outer wall, e.g., layers which coincide with about 10% to<br>
about 25% of the thickness from the outer wall. Whiskers can be used in<br>
multiple positions in the shell mold in situations where a very high degree of<br>
mold strength is required. Those skilled in the art can determine the most<br>
appropriate arrangement of whiskers through experiment, by varying the<br>
number and position of the whisker-containing layers, and then evaluating the<br>
resulting physical properties of the shell mold.<br>
When the whiskers are incorporated into a slurry layer of the mole their<br>
presence may increase the viscosity of the slurry considerably. Thus, the<br>
amount of whiskers in the slurry should be high enough to provide the<br>
desired level of reinforcement, but low enough to maintain a "workable"<br>
viscosity for the shell mold building steps. In the case of alumina-based<br>
whiskers used with alumina-based ceramic shell materials, the amount of<br>
whiskers used for a given slurry layer will preferably be less than about 35%<br>
by volume, based on the total volume of the slurry material used to form the<br>
layer.<br>
When the whiskers are incorporated into more than one of the shell mold<br>
layers, it is usually desirable to maintain the whiskers out of alignment from<br>
layer-to-layer. (As used herein, alignment refers to the alignment within the<br><br>
plane in which the whiskers are situated. The planes from layer to layer are<br>
substantially parallel to each other, since the layers are generally face-to-<br>
face.) This random alignment is especially desirable when whiskers are used<br>
in shell mold layers which are adjacent to each other. Clarify his statement with<br>
some specific examples i.e., the comparison between the physical properties<br>
indicating the level of reinforcement of the mold by alignment and nonalignment<br>
of whiskner within the salary layers. As an example, the<br>
whiskers can have a cross-wise orientation to whiskers in an adjacent layer<br>
(even though the whiskers from layer to layer are not usually in physical<br>
contact). In some especially preferred embodiments, the whiskers are<br>
oriented at an angle of about 60 degrees to about 90 degrees relative to<br>
adjacent-layer whiskers, and most preferably, at about 90 degrees relative to<br>
adjacent-layer whiskers.<br>
Various techniques can be practiced for maintaining the whiskers out of<br>
alignment from layer-to-layer. One illustration involves the lost wax process,<br>
which is further described herein. The wax pattern which is coated with the<br>
slurry of the ceramic coating material can be repositioned after each layer of<br>
whisker-containing slurry is applied. The repositioning is carried out relative<br>
to the direction of slurry-drainage. For example, if the pattern is rotated 90<br>
degrees, the slurry material will drain in a direction 90 degrees from the slurry<br>
material of the preceding layer, and the whiskers will tend to align themselves<br>
with the new direction of drainage. The use of automated equipment during<br>
the drainage process simplifies the adjustments needed to achieve the<br>
desired alignment of whiskers.<br>
The presence of the whiskers toughens the shell mold by providing a higher<br>
apparent elastic modulus. Moreover, the whiskers prevent substantial creep<br>
within the mold, which sometimes was a serious problem when the slurry<br>
layers contained only spherical or tabular ceramic particles. Dimensional<br>
stability of the mold - especially at high temperatures (e.g., casting<br><br>
temperatures of about 1450°C to 1750°C ) - is a key attribute of the present<br>
invention. Furthermore, because of their shape and size, it is relatively easy<br>
to fully incorporate the whiskers into the selected layers of the mold. This<br>
feature is especially advantageous in those situations in which the mold may<br>
have a complicated shape, e.g., with corners, sharp angles, and/or changing<br>
angles. In some instances, whiskers can be incorporated into such a mold<br>
with greater ease and effectiveness compared to the incorporation of the<br>
spiral fiber described in the Lane patent.<br>
The deposition of additional ceramic slurry/stucco aggregate layers is<br>
continued until the appropriate mold thickness is obtained. Usually, the mold,<br>
once fired, has a total wall thickness (i.e., from the inner wall to the outer<br>
wall) in the range of about 0.50 cm to about 2.50 cm, and preferably, about<br>
0.50 cm to about 1.25 cm.<br>
In some instances, cores are incorporated into shell molds being fabricated<br>
according to the present invention. The cores are often used to provide holes<br>
or cavities within the mold, and they may be formed by using inserts of<br>
vitreous silica, alumina, aluminates, or any combination of such materials, for<br>
example. The core material is removed from the final casting by conventional<br>
techniques. Many references describe the use of cores, e.g., Modern<br>
Metalworking; Casting and Forming Processes in Manufacturing; and U.S.<br>
Patents 4,097,292, and 4,086,311, all mentioned above. The reinforcement-<br>
whiskers of this invention assist in maintaining the proper metal thickness<br>
around cores within the mold - especially when the mold would normally be<br>
susceptible to creep and distortion at high temperature. Precise control over<br>
the size of cavities within the mold is often critical when forming metal parts<br>
which have intricate shapes, and/or which have very rigorous dimensional<br>
requirements.<br><br>
After the shell mold has been completed in the typical lost wax process, the<br>
wax is removed by any conventional technique. For example, flash-dewaxing<br>
can be carried out by plunging the mold into a steam autoclave, operating at<br>
a temperature of about 100°C - 200°C under steam pressure (about 90-120<br>
psi), for about 10-20 minutes. The mold is then usually pre-fired. A typical<br>
pre-firing procedure involves heating the mold at about 950°C to about<br>
1150°C, for about 60 minutes to about 120 minutes.<br>
The shell mold can then be fired according to conventional techniques. The<br>
required regimen of temperature and time for the firing stage will of course<br>
depend on factors such as wall thickness, mold composition, and the like.<br>
Typically, firing is carried out at a temperature in the range of about 1350°C<br>
to about 1750°C, for about 5 minutes to about 60 minutes. As the mold is<br>
fired, the whiskers react with the ceramic material in the shell mold. This<br>
reaction bonds the whiskers to the shell mold, providing greater strength and<br>
creep resistance to the mold.<br>
Metal can immediately be poured into the mold at this time, to carry out a<br>
desired casting operation. Alternatively, the mold can be allowed to cool to<br>
room temperature. Further steps which are conventional to mold fabrication<br>
may also be undertaken. These steps are well-known in the field of shell<br>
molds. Examples include techniques for repairing and smoothing the<br>
surfaces of the mold.<br>
Shell molds like those of the present invention are used for casting a wide<br>
variety of metals or metal alloys, such as titanium and nickel-based<br>
superalloys. Thus, components made from such materials with the reinforced<br>
shell mold are also within the scope of this invention.<br>
A non-limiting, illustrative set of specific process steps for preparing shell<br>
molds according to this invention is as follows.<br><br>
(1) A wax pattern is dipped into a slurry of -325 mesh tabular alumina and<br>
silica binder;<br>
(2) The coated pattern is drained;<br>
(3) The coated pattern is then placed in a rain machine with 80-grit fused<br>
alumina, for about 15-20 seconds;<br>
(4) The pattern is air-dried;<br>
(5) Steps 1-4 are repeated 2-8 times, using either the slurry used in step 1, or<br>
a whisker-containing slurry, as described below;<br>
(6) The pattern is dipped in a suspension of -240 mesh and -325 mesh<br>
alumina, with a silica binder;<br>
(7) The pattern is dipped in a fluidized bed of -54 mesh alumina;<br>
(8) The pattern is then air-dried; and<br>
(9) Steps 6-8 are repeated about 8 times.<br>
(Sometimes the first two layers applied in steps 1-4 are referred to as the<br>
"primary coat", while the layers applied in steps 6-9 are referred to as the<br>
"secondary coats").<br>
As a non-limiting example, the whiskers can be incorporated into the third<br>
and forth slurry layers, or into the third, forth, and fifth slurry layers. Selection<br>
of the steps in which the whiskers are incorporated is based in part on the<br>
desired position for the whiskers, as described previously. Moreover, the wax<br>
pattern is preferably rotated at about 90 degrees between dips in the whisker-<br>
containing slurry, as described above. This rotation will ensure that the fired<br>
mold contains whiskers in one portion of the mold wall which are oriented at<br>
about 90 degrees relative to whiskers in another portion of the mold wall.<br><br>
After preparation of the molds is complete, they are usually fired at 1000°C in<br>
air, to develop additional handling strength. The molds can then be fired at<br>
about 1550°C.<br>
While preferred embodiments have been set forth for the purpose of<br>
illustration, the foregoing description should not be deemed to be a limitation<br>

WE CLAIM<br>
1. A ceramic casting shell mold having a pre-selected shape, comprising<br>
repeating layers of ceramic material which define a wall thickness and<br>
shape of the mold, wherein at least two adjacent layers of the ceramic<br>
material contain whiskers which provide structural reinforcement to the<br>
shell mold, wherein the whiskers in one of the adjacent layers are out of<br>
alignment with the whiskers in the other adjacent layer, wherein the<br>
whiskers in one of the adjacent layers are oriented at an angle of about<br>
60 degress to about 90 degrees relative to the whiskers in the other<br>
adjacent layer.<br>
2. The shell mold as claimed in claim 1, wherein the whiskers are formed of<br>
a refractory material.<br>
3. The shell mold as claimed in claim 2, wherein the whiskers are formed of<br>
a material selected from the group consisting of alumina-based materials,<br>
aluminate-based materials, silicon carbide-based materials, and mixtures<br>
of any of the foregoing materials.<br>
4. The shell mold as claimed in claim 1, wherein the at least two adjacent<br>
layers of the ceramic material that contain whiskers are disposed at a<br>
position off-center of the wall-thickness of the mold.<br><br>
5. The shell mold as claimed in claim 4, comprising an inner wall adjacent a<br>
mold cavity, and an outer wail opposite the inner wall, said walls being<br>
separated by the total thickness of the shell mold, wherein the at least<br>
two adjacent slurry layers are situated within about 10% to about 40% of<br>
the thickness from the inner wall of the mold.<br>
6. The shell mold as claimed in claim 4, comprising an inner wall adjacent a<br>
mold cavity, and an outer wall opposite the inner wall, said wails being<br>
separated by the total thickness of the shell mold, wherein the at least<br>
two adjacent slurry layers are situated within about 10% to about 25% of<br>
the thickness from the outer wall.<br>
7. The shell mold as claimed in claim 1, wherein the whiskers have an<br>
average diameter of about 5 microns to about 200 microns.<br>
8. The shell mold as claimed in claim 1, wherein the whiskers have an aspect<br>
ratio in the range of about 10 to about 200.<br>
9. A method for making a ceramic casting shell mold, comprising the steps<br>
of:<br>
-applying a slurry which comprises ceramic-based whiskers to a ceramic<br>
layer-surface of a partial shell mold formed by applying successive ceramic<br>
layers over one another, forming at least two adjacent whisker-containing<br>
ceramic layers, wherein the whiskers in one of the adjacent layers are<br><br>
oriented so that they are out of alignment with the whiskers in the other<br>
adjacent layer, wherein the whiskers in one of the adjacent layers are<br>
oriented at an angle of about 60 degrees to about 90 degrees relative to the<br>
whiskers in the other adjacent layer;<br>
-completing the shell mold so that it has a desired wall-thickness, by applying<br>
additional ceramic layers over the at least two adjacent whisker-containing<br>
ceramic layers; and then<br>
-firing the shell mold at an elevated temperature.<br>
10. A shell mold prepared by the method as claimed in claim 9.<br>
The invention relates to a ceramic casting shell mold having a pre - selected<br>
shape, comprising repeating layers of ceramic material which define a wall<br>
thickness and shape of the mold, wherein atleast two adjacent layers of the<br>
ceramic material contain whiskers which provide structural reinforcement to the<br>
shell mold, wherein the whiskers in one of the adjacent layers are out of<br>
alignment with the whiskers in the other adjacent layer, wherein the whiskers in<br>
one of the adjacent layers are oriented at an angle of about 60 degrees to about<br>
90 degrees relative to the whiskers in the other adjacent layer.</td>
