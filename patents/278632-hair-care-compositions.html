The invention relates to hair care compositions comprising an effective amount of a condensation polymer having at least one, optionally quartemized or protonated, dialkylamide end-group connected through the polymer backbone to a unit derived from an alkylamide, the connection comprising at least one ester linkage<br>
in hair care products the use of polymers is gaining more and more importance, for example to improve the rheological behavior of the product or to enhance the adhesion of other ingredients to the hair. Thus, there is a growing need for polymers suitable for use in hair care compositions fulfilling the manifold requirements posed on such polymers in regard of availability, easy handling and/or cost performance<br>
In hair care preparation for example film forming polymers are used e.g. as conditioning agent in order to improve the comb ability, the shine and the visible appearance of the hair as well as to give the hair antistatic properties.<br>
Commercially available polymers for hair care such as hair styling or conditioning polymers are e.g. copolymers of vinyl acetate and crotonic<br>
acic, copolymers of methyl vinyl ether and maleic anhydride, copolymers of acrylic acid or methacrylic acid with other monomers, polyurethanes, N-vinylpyrrolidone and silicone polymers.<br>
The aim of the invention was to provide easily available, cost efficient hair care compositions comprising an effective amount of a condensation polymer having an, optionally quarternized, dialkylamide end-group connected through the polymer backbone to a unit derived from an alkylamide, the connection comprising at least one ester linkage. The hair care composition should fulfil a variety of requirements such as exhibiting low stickiness, lack of powdering or flaking, preferably being clear, transparent and glossy. Additionally, hair care compositions should offer excellent performance e.g. in regard of good film formation, good holding power, high level of style retention, prolonged curl retention, improved combability, and should be easily removed upon washing the hair with shampoo or soap.<br>
Polymers suitable for the incorporation into hair care compositions should exhibit a excellent heat stability, very good solubility, compatibility with cosmetic bases, pH stability in the range of 4 to 9, processability into a variety of products, compatibility with other ingredients and with the packaging materials and should be free of color and be of neutral or pleasant odor and have a low volatility.<br>
It has now surprisingly been found that condensation polymers having at least one, optionally quarternized, dialkylamide end-group connected through the polymer backbone to a unit derived from an alkylamide, the connection comprising at least one ester linkage (in the following referred to as condensation polymer) are especially suitable for the preparation of hair care compositions.<br>
It has also be found that they can be used as conditioning agents, strengthening agents, film forming agents, surfactants, anti-static agents,<br>
moisturizers, emulsifiers or hair styling agents in hair care compositions.<br>
Thus, the invention relates to hair care compositions comprising an effective amount of a condensation polymer having at least one, optionally quartemized or protonated, dialkylamide end-group connected through the polymer backbone to a unit derived from an alkylamide, the connection comprising at least one ester linkage.<br>

Inorganic compounds are pigments such as microparticulated TiO2, ZnO and the like. The term "microparticulated" refers to a particle size from about 5 nm to about 200 nm, particularly from about 15 nm to about<br>
100 nm. The TiO2 particles may also be coated by metal oxides such as e.g. aluminum or zirconium oxides or by organic coatings such as e.g. poiyols, methicone, aluminum stearate, alkyl silane. Such coatings are well known in the art.<br>
Examples of broad spectrum or UV A screening agents i.e. substances<br>
having absorption maximums between about 320 and 400 nm may be<br>

Pigments such as microparticulated ZnO or TiO2 and the like. The term "microparticulated" refers to a particle size from about 5 nm to about 200 nm, particularly from about 15 nm to about 100 nm. The particles may also be coated by other metal oxides such as e.g. aluminum or zirconium oxides or by organic coatings such as e.g. polyols, methicone, aluminum stearate, alkyl silane. Such coatings are well known in the art. As dibenzoylmethane derivatives have limited photostability it may be desirable to photostabilize these UV-A screening agents. Thus, the term "conventional UV-A screening agent" also refers to dibenzoylmethane derivatives such as e.g. PARSOL® 1789 stabilized by, e.g. 3,3-Diphenylacrylate derivatives as described in the European Patent Publications EP 0 514 491 B1 and EP 0 780 119 A1; Benzylidene camphor derivatives as described in the US Patent No. 5,605,680; Organosiloxan.es containing benzmalonate groups as described in the European Patent Publications EP 0358584 B1, EP 0538431 B1 and EP 0709080 A1.<br>

Stylina performance<br>
Determination of the styling effect of hair care compositions according to<br>
the invention comprising quaternized condensation polymers. The styling properties are determined by measuring the stiffness of hair tresses after treatment with a leave-on formulation (@ 1% active concentration in water/ ethanol 80:20).<br>
Hair tresses: Double bleached Caucasian hair, remis, 2 cm wide, 20 cm length, Kerling Gmbh.<br>
Experimental design: Each hair tress was immersed in 20.0g of the formulation in a closed glass cylinder. The cylinder was shaken horizontally for 1 min. The tresses were then removed, detangled and combed 20 times in a downward motion to remove all excess solution. The tresses were then allowed to dry overnight in ambient conditions. The stiffness was evaluated manually. The stiffness is summarised in the table below. The scale goes from + to +++ whereas +++ expresses very high degree of stiffness.<br>
<br>
As can be seen from the table, the quaternized hybranes lead to enhanced stiffness relative to placebo treatment which can be advantageously used in styling products.<br>
