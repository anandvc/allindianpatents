				<td>METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR TRANSMITTING AND RECEIVING DATA<br>
WITH HIGH RELIABILITY IN A MOBILE COMMUNICATION SYSTEM<br>
SUPPORTING PACKET DATA TRANSMISSION<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates generally to a mobile communication system supporting<br>
packet data service. More particularly, the present invention relates to a method and<br>
apparatus for transmitting control information required for Hybrid Automatic Repeat<br>
request (HARQ).<br>
Description of the Related Art<br>
Universal Mobile Telecommunication Service (UMTS), which is a 3rd generation<br>
mobile communication system using Wideband Code Division Multiple Access<br>
(WCDMA) based on the European Global System for Mobile communications (GSM)<br>
system and General Packet Radio Services (GPRS), provides mobile subscribers or<br>
computer users with a uniform service of transmitting packet-based text, digitized voice,<br>
and video and multimedia data at or above 2Mbps irrespective of their locations around<br>
the world.<br>
Particularly the UMTS system uses a transport channel called Enhanced Uplink<br>
Dedicated CHannel (E-DCH or EUDCH) in order to further improve the packet<br>
transmission performance of uplink communications from a User Equipment (UE) to a<br>
Node B (interchangeable with a base station). For more stable high-speed data<br>
transmission, Adaptive Modulation and Coding (AMC), HARQ, shorter Transmission<br>
Time Interval (TTI), and Node B-controlled scheduling were introduced for the E-DCH<br>
transmission.<br>
AMC is a technique of determining a Modulation and Coding Scheme (MCS) adaptively<br>
according to the channel status between the Node B and the UE. Many MCS levels can<br>
be defined according to available modulation schemes and coding schemes. The<br>
adaptive selection of an MCS level according to the channel status increases resource<br>
use efficiency.<br>
HARQ is a packet retransmission scheme for retransmitting a packet to correct errors in<br>
an initially transmitted packet. Shorter TTI is a technique for reducing retransmission<br>
time delay and thus increasing system throughput by allowing the use of a shorter TTI<br>
than the shortest TTI of 10ms provided by 3GPP Rel5.    At present, 2ms is under<br>
consideration as the length of such a shorter TTI.<br>
Node B-controlled scheduling is a scheme in which the Node B determines whether to<br>
permit E-DCH transmission for the LIE and if it does, an allowed maximum data rate and<br>
transmits the determined data rate information as a scheduling grant to the UE, and the<br>
UE determines an available E-DCH data rate based on the scheduling grant.<br>
The Node B-controlled scheduling is performed such that the noise rise or Rise over<br>
Thermal (RoT) measurement of the Node B does not exceed a target RoT to increase<br>
total system performance by, for example, allocating low data rates to remote UEs and<br>
high data rates to nearby UEs. RoT represents uplink radio resources used by the Node<br>
B, defined as<br>
RoT = IO/N,.....(1)<br>
where I0 denotes power spectral density over a total reception band, that is, the total<br>
amount of uplink signals received in the Node B, and No denotes the thermal noise<br>
power spectral density of the Node B. Therefore, an allowed maximum RoT is total<br>
uplink radio resources available to the Node B.<br>
The total RoT is expressed as the sum of inter-cell interference, voice traffic and E-DCH<br>
traffic. With Node B-controlled scheduling, simultaneous transmission of packets from<br>
a plurality of UEs at high data rates is prevented, maintaining the total RoT at or below a<br>
target RoT and thus ensuring reception performance.<br>
FIG. 1 is a diagram illustrating a typical signal flow for data transmission and reception<br>
on the E-DCH. In the illustrated case of FIG. 1, a UE transmits uplink data on the E-<br>
DCH and a Node B performs Node B-controlled scheduling for the UE.<br>
Referring to FIG. 1, the Node B and UE establish the E-DCH in step 102. Step 102<br>
involves message transmission on dedicated transport channels. The UE transmits<br>
scheduling information to the Node B in step 104. The scheduling information may<br>
contain uplink channel status information including the transmit power and power<br>
margin of the UE, and the amount of buffered data to be transmitted to the Node B.<br>
In step 106, the Node B monitors scheduling information from a plurality of UEs to<br>
schedule uplink data transmissions for the individual UEs. When the Node B decides to<br>
approve an uplink packet transmission from the UE, it transmits a scheduling grant<br>
including scheduling assignment information to the UE in step 108. The scheduling<br>
grant indicates up/hold/down in an allowed maximum data rate, or an allowed maximum<br>
data rate and allowed transmission timing. In step 110, the UE determines the TF of the<br>
E-DCH (E-TF) based on the scheduling grant. The UE then transmits E-TF information<br>
to the Node B in step 112, and uplink packet data on the E-DCH as well in step 114.<br>
The Node B determines whether the E-TF information and the uplink packet data have<br>
errors in step 116. In the presence of errors in either of the TF information and the<br>
uplink packet data, the Node B transmits a negative acknowledgement (NACK) signal to<br>
The UE on an acknowledgement/negative acknowledge (ACK/NACK) channel,<br>
whereas in the absence of errors in both, the Node B transmits an<br>
acknowledgement (ACK) signal to the UE on the ACK/NACK channel in step 118.<br>
In the latter case, the packet data transmission is completed and the UE<br>
transmits new packet data to the Node B on the E-DCH. On the other hand, in<br>
the former case, the UE retransmits the same packet data to the Node B on the<br>
E-DCH.<br>
For efficient scheduling under the above -described environment, the Node B<br>
receives scheduling information about buffer occupancy and power status from<br>
UEs. Based on the scheduling information, the Node B allocates low data rates to<br>
remote UEs. UEs in a bad channel status, and UEs having data with a low service<br>
class and high data rates to nearby UEs, UEs, in a good channel status, and UEs<br>
having data with a high service class.<br>
WO 2004/021635 discloses a variable puncturing for ARQ system. According to<br>
the invention, a physical layer (403) of a transmitter device, for example a<br>
mobile telephone or a base station of a mobile telecommunications network,<br>
allows for the transmission of multiple transport channels (405,406,407)<br>
simultaneously. Each channel is individually configurable as to CRC attachment<br>
(405a), channel coding (405b) and rate matching (405c). Blocks are punctured if<br>
required by the rate matching process (405c) before transmission. If a block is<br>
not received correctly, an algorithm in the rate matching process (405c) prepares<br>
a new data block for transmission using a different puncturing pattern. Each<br>
retransmission involves a different puncturing pattern until all possible<br>
puncturing patterns have been used, when the first used pattern is again used.<br>
This incremental redundancy results in improved reliability of data reception. A<br>
receiver is also disclosed, the receiver being arranged to read a transport format<br>
combination indicator forming part of the received block, from which the receiver<br>
can calculate an input to the rate matching algorithm in the transmitter, and<br>
from that calculate the puncturing pattern used and thus decode the data block.<br>
EP 1339188 discloses a channel coding method. According to the invention, the<br>
method for channel coding of data to be received with in a communication<br>
device (UE), comprises with a first subset of the data containing data symbols of<br>
a first quality class, with a second subset of the data containing data symbols of<br>
a second quality class, with a first set of correction data symbols to be used for a<br>
correction of data symbols in the first subset, with a second set of correction<br>
data symbols to be used for a correction of data symbols in the second subset.<br>
The first set of corrections bits is formed by an identification number (UE-ID) of<br>
the communication device.<br>
In this context, a need exists for developing a technique for transmitting and<br>
receiving a scheduling grant, which can be Absolute Grant (AG) indicating the<br>
absolute value of an allowed, maximum data rate for a UE or a Relative Grant<br>
(RG) indicating up/hold/down form the previous allowed maximum data rate.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
An aspect of the present invention is to propose at least the above problems<br>
and/or disadvantages and to provide at least the advantages described below.<br>
Accordingly, an aspect of the present invention is to provide a method and<br>
apparatus for improving the transmission reliability of control information of a<br>
small block size such as an E-DCH scheduling grant.<br>
The present invention also provides a method and apparatus for transmitting<br>
information with a higher reliability requirement, such as an Absolute Grant (AG)<br>
indicating an allowed maximum data rater for a UE.<br>
The above exemplary objects are achieved by providing a method and apparatus<br>
for transmitting control information of a small block size with high reliability in a<br>
mobile communication system supporting uplink packet data service.<br>
According to one aspect of an exemplary embodiment of the present invention,<br>
in a method of transmitting control information associated with uplink packet<br>
data transmission in a mobile communication system, a 16-bit UE-ID specific CRC<br>
is generated by combining a CRC generated for detecting errors from the control<br>
information with a User Equipment Identifier (UE-ID) for identifying a UE to<br>
receive the control information. 90 coded bits are generated by adding the UE-ID<br>
specific CRC and 8 tails bits to 6-bit control information and encoding the added<br>
bits at a coding rate of 1/3. A 60-bits rate-matched block is generated by rate -<br>
matching the coded bits according to a predetermined rate matching pattern<br>
representing the positions of bits to .......................................................................<br>
be punctured among the coded bits. The rate-matched block is transmitted to<br>
the            UE.            The            rate            matching             pattern            is<br>
{1,2,5,6,7,11,12,14,15,17,23,24,31,37,44,47,61,63,64,71,72,75,77,80,83,84,85,8<br>
7,88,90}. The control information comprises an indication of an allowed<br>
maximum data rate for uplink transmission.<br>
According to another aspect of the an exemplary embodiment of the present<br>
invention, in an apparatus of transmitting control information associated with<br>
uplink packet data transmission in a mobile communication system, a UE-ID<br>
specific CRC generator generates a 16-bit UE-ID specific CRC by combining a<br>
CRC generated for detecting errors from the control information with a UE-ID for<br>
identifying a UE to receive the control information. A channel encoder generates<br>
90 coded bits by adding the UE-ID specific CRC and 8 tails bits to 6-bit control<br>
information and encoding the added bits at a coding rate of 1/3. A rate matcher<br>
generates a 60-bit rate-matched block by rate - matching the coded bits<br>
according to a predetermined rate matching pattern representing the positions of<br>
bits to be punctured among the coded bits. A physical channel mapper transmits<br>
the rate-matched block to the UE. The rate matching pattern is<br>
{1,2,5,6,7,11,12,14,15,17,23,24,31,37,44,47,61,63,64,71,72,75,77,80,83,84,85,8<br>
7,88,90}. The control information comprises an indication of an allowed<br>
maximum data rate for uplink transmission.<br>
According to a further aspect of the an exemplary embodiment of the present<br>
invention, in a method of receiving control information associated with uplink<br>
packet data transmission in a mobile communication system, a 60-bit rate-<br>
matched is extracted from a signal received from a Node B. 90 coded bits are<br>
generated by rate-dematching the rate - matched block according to a<br>
predetermined rate matching pattern representing the positions of bits to be<br>
depunctured. 6-bit control information and a 16-bit UE-ID specific CRC are<br>
obtained by decoding the coded bits at a coding rate of 1/3. The control<br>
information is output by checking the UE-ID specific CRC. The rate matching<br>
pattern                                                                                                           is<br>
{1,2,5,6,7,11,12,14,15,17,23,24,31,37,44,47,61,63,64,71,72,75,77,80,83,84,85,8<br>
7,88,90}. The control information comprises an indication of an allowed<br>
maximum data rate for uplink transmission.<br>
According to still another aspect of the an exemplary embodiment of the present<br>
invention, in an apparatus for receiving control information associated with<br>
uplink packet data transmission in a mobile communication system, a physical<br>
channel demapper extracts a 60-bit rate-matched from a signal received from a<br>
Node B. A rate dematcher generates 90 coded bits by rate-dematching the rate-<br>
matched block according to a predetermined rate matching pattern representing<br>
thepositions of bits to be depunctured. A channel decoder generates 6-bit control<br>
information and a 16-bit UE-ID specific CRC by encoding the coded bits at a<br>
coding rate of 1/3. A CRC checker outputs the control information by checking<br>
the UE-ID specific CRC. The rate matching pattern is<br>
{1,2,5,6,7,11,12,14,15,17,23,24,31,37,44,47,61,63,64,71,72,75,77,80,83,84,85,8<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS<br>
The matters defined in the description such as a detailed construction and elements are<br>
provided to assist in a comprehensive understanding of the embodiments of the<br>
invention. Accordingly, those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that various<br>
changes and modifications of the embodiments described herein can be made without<br>
departing from the scope and spirit of the invention. Also, descriptions of well-known<br>
functions and constructions are omitted for clarity and conciseness.<br>
Certain exemplary embodiments of the present invention will be described below in the<br>
context of the E-DCH of UMTS. A physical channel called E-DCH Absolute Grant<br>
CHannel (E-AGCH) carries an AG from a Node B to a UE. The AG is determined by<br>
the Node B scheduler according to scheduling information received from the UE and<br>
uplink radio resources available to the Node B.<br>
The AG can include an allowed maximum data rate indicating the maximum amount of<br>
uplink radio resources available to the UE or a power offset equivalent to the allowed<br>
maximum data rate, an AG validity duration indicator indicating how long the AG is<br>
valid, and an AG validity process indicator indicating whether the AG is valid for one<br>
particular HARQ process or an entire HARQ process. The power offset is defined as a<br>
maximum power ratio of an Enhanced Dedicated Physical Data CHannel (E-DPDCH)<br>
on which the E-DCH is mapped to a reference physical channel whose power is<br>
controlled, Dedicated Physical Control CHannel (DPCCH). A 4 to 8-bit allowed<br>
maximum data rate or power offset, a 1-bit AG validity duration indicator, and a 1-bit<br>
AG validity process indicator are under consideration. The E-AGCH further requires a<br>
UE-ID for identifying the UE on a common channel and a Cyclic Redundancy Check<br>
(CRC) code for detecting errors from the AG. The UE-ID and the CRC each have 16<br>
bits and are modulo-2 operated on a bit basis. They are included together with the AG<br>
in control information delivered on the E-AGCH, in the form of a 16-bit CRC masked<br>
with a UE-ID.<br>
Therefore, the control information of the E-AGCH can be a total of 21 to 26 bits in<br>
length. This control information, particularly the AG is intended for efficient radio<br>
resource allocation and thus requires high reliability in transmission. Typically,<br>
communication systems use channel coding for high-reliability data<br>
transmission/reception. The channel coding enables a receiver to correct transmission<br>
errors by attaching redundancy information to transmission data.<br>
A convolutional code with a constraint length of 9 and a coding rate of 1/3, defined in<br>
the 3GPP standards, can be taken as a channel coding technique for high-reliability E-<br>
AGCH transmission and reception. 21 to 26-bit control information to be delivered on<br>
the E-AGCH is attached with 8 tail bits and then encoded to 87 to 102 coded bits<br>
((21+8)x3=87, (26+8)x3=102) through rate 1/3 convolutional coding.<br>
FIG. 2A illustrates a convolutional encoder 200 with a constraint length of 9 and a<br>
coding rate of 1/3 defined in the 3GPP standards.<br>
Referring to FIG. 2A, the convolutional encoder 200 includes eight serial shift registers<br>
202, 204, 206, 208, 210, 212, 214 and 216 and a plurality of adders 202b, 202c, 204a,<br>
204c, 206a, 206b, 208b, 210a, 210c, 212a, 214a, 214b, 216a. 216b and 216c for<br>
receiving input information bits or the output bits of the shift registers 202 to 216. Input<br>
information including eight tail bits sequentially pass through the shift registers 202 to<br>
216, starting from the first bit, and coded bits are produced in an order of outputO,<br>
outputl, output2, outputO, outputl, output2,....<br>
The channel-coded control information is delivered in a 2-ms TT1 of the E-AGCH. If a<br>
Spreading Factor (SF) of 256 and Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK) are applied to<br>
the E-AGCH, a total of 60 bits can be transmitted in the 2-ms TT1. Therefore, 27 bits<br>
(=87-60) to 42 bits (=102-60) are punctured from the coded control information of the E-<br>
AGCH. Rate matching can be used for the puncturing. The rate matching matches the<br>
number of the channel-coded bits to that of transmittable bits on a physical channel by<br>
puncturing or repeating bits at predetermined positions in the channel-coded bit stream<br>
of a block. Generally, the punctured or repeated bit positions are equidistant in the rate<br>
matching.<br>
However, rate matching of small-size control information, such as, 20 bits delivered on<br>
the E-AGCH makes it difficult to achieve an optimum BLock Error Rate (BLER). If<br>
such a block with a relatively small number of bits is convolutionally encoded and rate-<br>
matched, the start and end of the block experience low Bit Error Rates (BERs), while its<br>
middle has a high BER. Consequently, the BLER of the block is increased and the<br>
reliability of the E-AGCH is decreased. The existence of at least one erroneous bit in<br>
one block leads to a BLER. If a particular part of one block has a low BER but the<br>
remaining part has a high BER, this results in performance degradation rather than<br>
performance improvement from the BLER's point of view.<br>
High-reliability (i.e. less erroneous) transmission and reception of the E-AGCH control<br>
information is achieved by reducing its BLER. Yet, the conventional rate matching<br>
leads to a large BER deviation at each bit position of the block.<br>
In this context, the exemplary embodiments of the present invention are intended to<br>
provide rate matching, which minimizes BLER and enables transmission of control<br>
information of a small block size. To serve this purpose, rate matching patterns are<br>
proposed, which minimize the change of BER at each bit position of one block of<br>
control information and thus reduce BLER for the E-AGCH that delivers small-size<br>
control information of about 20 bits after convolutional channel coding.<br>
Rate matching patterns which may improve the BLER performance of control<br>
information delivered on the E-AGCH maybe realized in certain exemplary<br>
embodiments of the present invention. First through sixth exemplary embodiments<br>
pertain to examples of rate matching patterns and corresponding transmission and<br>
reception for a 7-bit AG, an 8-bit AG, a 9-bit AG, a 10-bit AG and a 5-bit AG,<br>
respectively.<br>
Exemplary Embodiment 1<br>
A rate matching pattern for a 6-bit AG is provided as an example of an implementation<br>
of the present invention. For instance, the AG includes a 4-bit allowed maximum data<br>
rate representing the maximum amount of uplink radio resources available to a UE or a<br>
4-bit power offset equivalent to the allowed maximum data rate, a 1-bit AG validity<br>
duration indicator for indicating how long the AG is valid, and a 1-bit AG validity<br>
process indicator for indicating whether the AG is valid for one particular HARQ<br>
process or an entire HARQ process. Or the AG includes a 5-bit allowed maximum data<br>
rate or power offset and a 1-bit AG validity duration indicator.<br>
In a third example, the AG includes a 5-bit allowed maximum data rate or power offset<br>
and a 1-bit AG validity process indicator. Or the AG is configured to include an allowed<br>
maximum data rate or power offset, an AG validity duration indicator, an AG validity<br>
process indicator, and other E-AGCH control bits in a total of six bits.<br>
Besides the AG, the E-AGCH carries a UE-ID for identifying a UE and a CRC for<br>
detecting errors from the AG. The UE-ID and the CRC each have 16 bits and modulo-2<br>
operated on a bit basis. Thus they are transmitted in the form of a 16-bit CRC masked<br>
with the UE-ID. This 16-bit CRC is called a UE-ID specific CRC. The UE can<br>
determine whether a received AG is intended for the UE by the UE-ID specific CRC.<br>
Eight tail bits are added to 22-bit control information with the 6-bit AG concatenated to<br>
the 16-bit UE-ID specific CRC and convolutionally encoded with a constraints length of<br>
9 at a coding rate of 1/3. As a result, one channel-coded block being a 90-bit coded bit<br>
stream is produced. 30 bits are punctured from the 90-bit channel-coded block for<br>
transmission in a 2-ms E-AGCH TTI to which an SF of 256 and QPSK apply, creating a<br>
60-bit rate-matched block. A rate matching pattern representing the positions of the<br>
punctured bits is simulated in a manner that decreases the change of BER at each bit<br>
position of the rate-matched block and thus improves BLER performance. The<br>
following rate matching patterns are available.<br>
Rate matching pattern=<br><br>
The elements of each of the rate matching patterns represent the positions of bits to be<br>
punctured among the channel-coded bits #1 to #90. Given a 10-ms E-AGCH TTI, the 2-<br>
ms E-AGCH TTI occurs five times.<br>
FIG. 3 is a block diagram of a Node B transmitter for transmitting the E-AGCH<br>
according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 3, upon input of a 6-bit AG 302, a UE-ID specific CRC adder 304<br>
creates a 16-bit CRC from the AG, generates a UE-ID specific CRC by modulo-2<br>
operating the 16-bit CRC with a 16-bit UE-ID for identifying the UE to receive the AG,<br>
and then combines the UE-ID specific CRC with the AG, thereby producing 22-bit<br>
control information. A channel encoder 308, which uses a convolutional code with a<br>
constraint length of 9 and a coding rate 1/3, adds eight tail bits to the 22-bit control<br>
information and convolutionally encodes the 30-bit information to a 90-bit coded block.<br>
A rate matcher 310 punctures the 90-bit coded block in a predetermined rate matching<br>
pattern. A physical channel mapper 312 maps the rate-matched block to a physical<br>
channel frame configured to be suitable for 2-ms E-AGCH TTIs. Thus, the control<br>
information is transmitted on an E-AGCH 314. Meanwhile, a control information<br>
transmission controller 316 controls transmission of the control information for an E-<br>
DCH through the UE-ID specific CRC adder 304, the channel encoder 308, the rate<br>
matcher 310, and the physical channel mapper 312. In an exemplary implementation,<br>
the control information transmission controller 316 manages the coding rate of the<br>
channel encoder 308 and the rate matching pattern of the rate matcher 310. The control<br>
information transmission controller 316 stores at least one of the above rate matching<br>
patterns and applies one of the rate matching patterns to the rate matcher 310. The rate<br>
matching pattern used is preset between the transmitter and a receiver. The control<br>
information transmission controller 316 can be incorporated into a packet data reception<br>
controller (not shown) for controlling reception of packet data on the E-DCH.<br>
FIG. 4 is a block diagram of a UE receiver for receiving the E-AGCH according to an<br>
exemplary embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 4, the UE receives a signal on an E-AGCH 402. A physical channel<br>
demapper 404 extracts a rate-matched block from a 2-ms TTI in the received signal. A<br>
rate dematcher 406 recovers (that is, depunctures) the bits punctured by the rate matcher<br>
310 for the rate-matched block by filling 0s at the punctured bit positions according to<br>
the rate matching pattern used in the rate matcher 310 of the Node B. If the E-AGCH<br>
402 uses a 10-ms TTI with five repeated 2-ms TTIs, the physical channel demapper 404<br>
and the rate dematcher 406 perform the same operation five times and combine the<br>
resulting coded sub-blocks to one coded block.<br>
A channel decoder 408 decodes the coded block received from the rate dematcher 406.<br>
The coded block is divided into a 6-bit AG and a 16-bit UE-ID specific CRC. A UE-ID<br>
specific CRC extractor 410 extracts a 16-bit CRC by modulo-2 operating the 16-bit UE-<br>
ID specific CRC with the 16-bit UE-ID 412 of the UE, and provides the extracted CRC<br>
and the AG to a CRC checker 414. The CRC checker 414 checks the 16-bit CRC to<br>
detect errors from the AG. If the CRC check passes, the CRC checker 414 outputs the<br>
error-free AG 416. The AG 416 is used for determining an allowed maximum data rate<br>
for E-DCH data. lithe CRC check fails, the AG is discarded.<br>
Meanwhile, a control information reception controller 418 controls the reception of the<br>
control information for the E-DCH through the physical channel demapper 404, the rate<br>
dematcher 406, the channel decoder 408, the UE-ID specific CRC extractor 410, and the<br>
CRC checker 414. In an exemplary implementation, the control information reception<br>
controller 418 manages the rate matching pattern of the rate dematcher 406 and the<br>
coding rate of the channel decoder 408. The control information reception controller<br>
418 stores at least one of the above rate matching patterns and applies one of the rate<br>
matching patterns to the rate dematcher 406. The control information reception<br>
controller 418 can be incorporated into a packet data transmission controller (not shown)<br>
for controlling transmission of packet data on the E-DCH.<br>

the 16-bit UE-ID specific CRC and convolutionally encoded with a constraints length of<br>
9 at a coding rate of 1/3.  As a result, one channel-coded block being a 93-bit coded bit<br>
stream is produced. 33 bits are punctured from the 93-bit channel-coded block for<br>
transmission in a 2-ms E-AGCH TTI to which an SF of 256 and QPSK apply, creating a<br>

stream is produced. 42 bits are punctured from the 102-bit channel-coded block for<br>
transmission in a 2-ms E-AGCH TTI to which an SF of 256 and QPSK apply, creating a<br>
60-bit rate-matched block.   A rate matching pattern representing the positions of the<br>
punctured bits is simulated in a manner that decreases the change of BER at each bit<br>
position of the rate-matched block and thus improves BLER performance.    The<br>
following rate matching patterns are available.<br>
Rate matching pattern=<br><br>
The elements of each of the rate matching patterns represent the positions of bits to be<br>
punctured among the channel-coded bits #1 to #102. Given a 10-ms E-AGCH TTl, the<br>
2-ms E-AGCH TTI occurs five times.<br>
With reference to FIG. 3, a Node B transmitter for transmitting the E-AGCH according<br>
to the fifth exemplary embodiment of the present invention will be described.<br>
Referring to FIG. 3, upon input of a 10-bit AG 302, the UE-ID specific CRC adder 304<br>
creates a 16-bit CRC from the AC, generates a UE-ID specific CRC by modulo-2<br>
operating the 16-bit CRC with a 16-bit UE-ID for identifying the UE to receive the AG,<br>
and then combines the UE-ID specific CRC with the AG, thereby producing 26-bit<br>
control information. The channel encoder 308, which uses a convolutional code with a<br>
constraint length of 9 and a coding rate 1/3, adds eight tail bits to the 26-bit control<br>
information and convolutionally encodes the 34-bit information to a 102-bit coded<br>
block.<br>
The rate matcher 310 punctures the 102-bit coded block in a predetermined rate<br>
matching pattern. The physical channel mapper 312 maps the rate-matched block to a<br>
physical channel frame configured to be suitable for 2-ms E-AGCH TTIs. Thus, the<br>
control information is transmitted on the E-AGCH 314. Meanwhile, the control<br>
information transmission controller 316 controls transmission of the control information<br>
for an E-DCH through the UE-1D specific CRC adder 304. the channel encoder 308, the<br>
rate matcher 310, and the physical channel mapper 312. The control information<br>
transmission controller 316 stores at least one of the above rate matching patterns and<br>
applies a preset one of the rate matching patterns to the rate matcher 310.<br>
With reference to FIG. 4, a UE receiver for receiving the E-AGCH according to the fifth<br>
exemplary embodiment of the present invention will be described.<br>
Referring to FIG. 4. the UE receives a signal on the E-AGCH 402. The physical channel<br>
demapper 404 extracts a rate-matched block from a 2-ms TTI in the received signal.<br>
The rate dematcher 406 recovers (i.e. depunctures) the bits punctured by the rate<br>
matcher 310 for the rate-matched block according to the rate matching pattern used in<br>
the rate matcher 310 of the Node B. If the E-AGCH 402 uses a 10-ms TTI with five<br>
repeated 2-ms TTIs. the physical channel demapper 404 and the rate dematcher 406<br>
perform the same operation five times and combine the resulting coded sub-blocks to<br>
one coded block.<br>
The channel decoder 408 decodes the coded block received from the rate dematcher 406.<br>
The coded block is divided into a 10-bit AG and a 16-bit UE-ID specific CRC. The UE-<br>
ID specific CRC extractor 410 extracts a 16-bit CRC by modulo-2 operating the 16-bit<br>
UE-ID specific CRC with the 16-bit UE-ID 412 of the UE, and provides the extracted<br>
CRC and the AG to the CRC checker 414. The CRC checker 414 checks the 16-bit<br>
CRC to detect errors from the AG. If the CRC check passes, the CRC checker 414<br>
outputs the error-free AG 416. The AG 416 is used for determining an allowed<br>
maximum data rate for E-DCH data. If the CRC check fails, the AG is discarded.<br>
Meanwhile, the control information reception controller 418 controls the reception of the<br>
control information for the E-DCH through the physical channel demapper 404, the rate<br>
dematcher 406, the channel decoder 408, the UE-ID specific CRC extractor 410, and the<br>
CRC checker 414.<br>
Exemplary Embodiment 6<br>
A rate matching pattern for a 5-bit AG is provided as an example of an implementation<br>
of the present invention. For instance, the AG includes a 4-bit allowed maximum data<br>
rate representing the maximum amount of uplink radio resources available to a UE or a<br>
4-bit power offset equivalent to the allowed maximum data rate and a 1-bit AG validity<br>
duration indicator indicating how long the AG is valid. Or the AG includes a 4-bit<br>
allowed maximum data rate or power offset and a 1-bit AG validity duration indicator<br>
indicating whether the AG is valid for one particular HARQ process or an entire HARQ<br>
process.<br>
Besides the AG, the E-AGCH carries a UE-ID for identifying a UE and a CRC for<br>
detecting errors from the AG. The UE-ID and the CRC each have 16 bits and modulo-2<br>
operated on a bit basis. Thus they are transmitted in the form of a 16-bit CRC masked<br>
with the UE-ID. This 16-bit CRC is called a UE-ID specific CRC. The UE can<br>
determine whether a received AG is intended for the UE by the UE-ID specific CRC.<br>
Eight tail bits are added to 21-bit control information with the 5-bit AG concatenated to<br>
the 16-bit UE-ID specific CRC and convolutionally encoded with a constraints length of<br>
9 at a coding rate of 1/3. As a result, one channel-coded block being an 87-bit coded bit<br>
stream is produced. 27 bits are punctured from the 87-bit channel-coded block for<br>
transmission in a 2-ms E-AGCH TTI to which an SF of 256 and QPSK apply, creating a<br>
60-bit rate-matched block. A rate matching pattern representing the positions of the<br>
punctured bits is simulated in a manner that decreases the change of BER at each bit<br>
position of the rate-matched block and thus improves BLER performance. When 2-ms<br>
TTIs are used for the E-AGCH, the following rate matching pattern is available.<br>
Rate matching pattern={l, 2, 3, 6, 7, 10, 12, 14, 17, 19, 20, 21, 39, 45, 48, 59, 65, 67, 74,<br>
75,76,80,81,83,85,86,87}<br>
The elements of the rate matching pattern represent the positions of bits to be punctured<br>
among the channel-coded bits #1 to #87. Given a 10-ms E-AGCH TTI, the 2-ms E-<br>
AGCH TTI occurs five times.<br>
With reference to FIG. 3, a Node B transmitter for transmitting the E-AGCH according<br>
to the sixth exemplary embodiment of the present invention will be described.<br>
Referring to FIG. 3, upon input of a 5-bit AG 302, the UE-ID specific CRC adder 304<br>
creates a 16-bit CRC from the AC, generates a UE-ID specific CRC by modulo-2<br>
operating the 16-bit CRC with a 16-bit UE-ID for identifying the UE to receive the AG,<br>
and then combines the UE-ID specific CRC with the AG, thereby producing 21-bit<br>
control information. The channel encoder 308, which uses a convolutional code with a<br>
constraint length of 9 and a coding rate 1/3, adds eight tail bits to the 21-bit control<br>
information and convolutionally encodes the 29-bit information to an 87-bit coded<br>
block.<br>
The rate matcher 310 punctures the 87-bit coded block in a predetermined rate matching<br>
pattern. The physical channel mapper 312 maps the rate-matched block to a physical<br>
channel frame configured to be suitable for 2-ms E-AGCH TTIs. Thus, the control<br>
information is transmitted on the E-AGCH 314. Meanwhile, the control information<br>
transmission controller 316 controls transmission of the control information for an E-<br>
DCH through the UE-ID specific CRC adder 304, the channel encoder 308, the rate<br>
matcher  310,   and  the  physical  channel  mapper  312.     The  control  information<br>
transmission controller 316 stores the above rate matching pattern and applies it to the<br>
rate matcher 310.<br>
With reference to FIG. 4, a UE receiver for receiving the E-AGCH according to the sixth<br>
exemplary embodiment of the present invention will be described.<br>
Referring to FIG. 4, the UE receives a signal on the E-AGCH 402. The physical channel<br>
demapper 404 extracts a rate-matched block from a 2-ms TTI in the received signal.<br>
The rate dematcher 406 recovers (i.e. depunctures) the bits punctured by the rate<br>
matcher 310 for the rate-matched block according to the rate matching pattern used in<br>
the rate matcher 310 of the Node B.   If the E-AGCH 402 uses a 10-ms TTI with five<br>
repeated 2-ms TTIs, the physical channel demapper 404 and the rate dematcher 406<br>
perform the same operation five times and combine the resulting coded sub-blocks to<br>
one coded block.<br>
The channel decoder 408 decodes the coded block received from the rate dematcher 406.<br>
The coded block is divided into a 5-bit AG and a 16-bit UE-ID specific CRC. The UE-<br>
ID specific CRC extractor 410 extracts a 16-bit CRC by modulo-2 operating the 16-bit<br>
UE-ID specific CRC with the 16-bit UE-ID 412 of the UE, and provides the extracted<br>
CRC and the AG to the CRC checker 414.   The CRC checker 414 checks the 16-bit<br>
CRC to detect errors from the AG.   If the CRC check passes, the CRC checker 414<br>
outputs the error-free AG 416.    The AG 416 is used for determining an allowed<br>
maximum data rate for E-DCH data. If the CRC check fails, the AG is discarded.<br>
Meanwhile, the control information reception controller 418 controls the reception of the<br>
control information for the E-DCH through the physical channel demapper 404, the rate<br>
dematcher 406, the channel decoder 408, the UE-ID specific CRC extractor 410, and the<br>
CRC checker 414.<br>
The first to sixth exemplary embodiments of the present invention described above use<br>
a convolutional code with a constraint length of 9 and a coding rate of 1/3 defined in the<br>
3GPP standards as a channel encoding method for the E-AGCH.   Below, seventh to<br>
eleventh exemplary embodiments of the present invention provide rate matching of the<br>
E-AGCH where a convolutional code with a constraint length of 9 and a coding rate of<br>
1/2 defined in the 3GPP standards is used as a channel encoding method for the E-<br>
AGCH.<br>
21 to 26-bit control information to be delivered on the E-AGCH is attached with 8 tail<br>
bits and then encoded to 58 to 68 coded bits ((21+8)x2=58, (26+8)x2=68) through rate<br>
1/3 convolutional coding.<br>
FIG. 2B illustrates a convolutional encoder with a constraint length of 9 and a coding<br>
rate of 1/2 defined in the 3GPP standards.<br>
Referring to FIG. 2B, a convolutional encoder 220 includes eight serial shift registers<br>
222, 224, 226, 228, 230, 232, 234 and 236 and a plurality of adders 222b, 224a, 224b,<br>
226a, 226b, 228a, 230b, 234b, 236a and 236b for receiving input information bits or the<br>
outputs bits of the shift registers 222 to 236. Input information including eight tail bits<br>
being zeroes sequentially pass through the shift registers 222 to 236, starting from the<br>
first bit, and coded bits are produced in an order of outputO, outputl, output2, outputO,<br>
output 1, output2.....<br>
The channel-coded control information is delivered in a 2-ms TTI of the E-AGCH. If an<br>
SF of 256 and QPSK are applied to the E-AGCH, a total of 60 bits can be transmitted in<br>
the 2-ms TTI. Therefore, 2 bits (=58-60) are repeated or up to 8 bits (=68-60) are<br>
punctured from the coded control information of the E-AGCH. One thing to note herein<br>
is that in the case of a 6-bit AG, control information including the 6-bit AG, a 16-bit UE-<br>
ID specific CRC, and 8 tail bits is convolutionally encoded with a constraint length of 9<br>
at a coding rate of 1/2 to 60 channel-coded bits. Since the number of transmittable bits<br>
in a 2-ms TTI is 60, there is no need for rate matching in this case.<br>
The following exemplary embodiments of the present invention are intended to provide<br>
rate matching patterns which minimize the BLER performance of control information<br>
delivered on the E-AGCH. The seventh through eleventh exemplary embodiments of<br>
the present invention provide rate matching patterns and corresponding transmission and<br>
reception methods for a 5-bit AG, 7-bit AG, 8-bit AG, 9-bit AG and a 10-bit AG,<br>
respectively.<br>
Exemplary Embodiment 7<br>
A rate matching pattern for a 5-bit AG is provided as an example of an implementation<br>
of the present invention. For instance, the AG includes a 4-bit allowed maximum data<br>

size of the channel-coded block to a 2-ms E-AGCH TTI to which an SF of 256 and<br>
QPSK apply.   Thus, a 60-bit rate-matched block is created.   A rate matching pattern<br>
representing the positions of the repeated bits is simulated in a manner that decreases the<br>
change of BER at each bit position of the rate-matched block and thus improves BLER<br>
performance. The following rate matching pattern is available.<br>

With reference to FIG. 3, a Node B transmitter for transmitting the E-AGCH according<br>
to the ninth exemplary embodiment of the present invention will be described.<br>
Referring to FIG. 3, upon input of an 8-bit AG 302, the UE-ID specific CRC adder 304<br>
creates a 16-bit CRC from the AC, generates a UE-ID specific CRC by modulo-2<br>
operating the 16-bit CRC with a 16-bit UE-ID for identifying the UE to receive the AG,<br>
and then combines the UE-ID specific CRC with the AG, thereby producing 24-bit<br>
control information. The channel encoder 308, which uses a convolutional code with a<br>
constraint length of 9 and a coding rate 1/2, adds eight tail bits to the 24-bit control<br>
information and convolutionally encodes the 32-bit information to a 64-bit coded block.<br>
The rate matcher 310 punctures the 64-bit coded block in a predetermined rate matching<br>
pattern. The physical channel mapper 312 maps the rate-matched block to a physical<br>
channel frame configured to be suitable for 2-ms E-AGCH TTIs. Thus, the control<br>
information is transmitted on the E-AGCH 314. Meanwhile, the control information<br>
transmission controller 316 controls transmission of the control information for an E-<br>
DCH through the UE-ID specific CRC adder 304, the channel encoder 308, the rate<br>
matcher 310, and the physical channel mapper 312. The control information<br>
transmission controller 316 stores at least one of the above rate matching patterns and<br>
applies a preset one of the rate matching patterns to the rate matcher 310.<br>
With reference to FIG. 4, a UE receiver for receiving the E-AGCH according to the<br>
ninth exemplary embodiment of the present invention will be described.<br>
Referring to FIG. 4, the UE receives a signal on the E-AGCH 402. The physical channel<br>
demapper 404 extracts a rate-matched block from a 2-ms TTI in the received signal.<br>
The rate dematcher 406 recovers (i.e. depunctures) the bits punctured by the rate<br>
matcher 310 for the rate-matched block according to the rate matching pattern used in<br>
the rate matcher 310 of the Node B. If the E-AGCH 402 uses a 10-ms TTI with five<br>
repeated 2-ms TTIs, the physical channel demapper 404 and the rate dematcher 406<br>
perform the same operation five times and combine the resulting coded sub-blocks to<br>
one coded block.<br>
The channel decoder 408 decodes the coded block received from the rate dematcher 406.<br>
The coded block is divided into an 8-bit AG and a 16-bit UE-ID specific CRC. The UE-<br>
ID specific CRC extractor 410 extracts a 16-bit CRC by modulo-2 operating the 16-bit<br>
UE-ID specific CRC with the 16-bit UE-ID 412 of the UE, and provides the extracted<br>
CRC and the AG to the CRC checker 414. The CRC checker 414 checks the 16-bit<br>
CRC to detect errors from the AG. If the CRC check passes, the CRC checker 414<br>
outputs the error-free AG 416. The AG 416 is used for determining an allowed<br>
maximum data rate for E-DCH data. If the CRC check fails, the AG is discarded.<br>
Meanwhile, the control information reception controller 418 controls the reception of the<br>
control information for the E-DCH through the physical channel demapper 404, the rate<br>
dematcher 406, the channel decoder 408, the UE-ID specific CRC extractor 410, and the<br>
CRC checker 414.<br>
Exemplary Embodiment 10<br>
A rate matching pattern for a 9-bit AG is provided as an example of an implementation<br>
of the present invention. For instance, the AG includes a 7-bit allowed maximum data<br>
rate representing the maximum amount of uplink radio resources available to a UE or a<br>
7-bit power offset equivalent to the allowed maximum data rate, a 1-bit AG validity<br>
duration indicator indicating how long the AG is valid, and a 1-bit AG validity process<br>
indicator indicating whether the AG is valid for one particular HARQ process or an<br>
entire HARQ process. Or the AG includes an 8-bit allowed maximum data rate or<br>
power offset and a 1-bit AG validity duration indicator.<br>
In a third example, the AG includes an 8-bit allowed maximum data rate or power offset<br>
and a 1-bit AG validity process indicator. Or the AG is configured to include an allowed<br>
maximum data rate or power offset, an AG validity duration indicator, an AG validity<br>
process indicator, and other E-AGCH control bits in a total of nine bits.<br>
Besides the AG, the E-AGCH carries a UE-ID for identifying a UE and a CRC for<br>
detecting errors from the AG. The UE-ID and the CRC each have 16 bits and modulo-2<br>
operated on a bit basis. Thus they are transmitted in the form of a 16-bit CRC masked<br>
with the UE-ID. This 16-bit CRC is called a UE-ID specific CRC. The UE can<br>
determine whether a received AG is intended for the UE by the UE-ID specific CRC.<br>
Eight tail bits are added to 25-bit control information with the 9-bit AG concatenated to<br>
the 16-bit UE-ID specific CRC and convolutionally encoded with a constraints length of<br>
9 at a coding rate of 1/2. As a result, one channel-coded block being a 66-bit coded bit<br>
stream is produced. 6 bits are punctured from the 66-bit channel-coded block for<br>
transmission in a 2-ms E-AGCH TTI to which an SF of 256 and QPSK apply, creating a<br>
60-bit rate-matched block. A rate matching pattern representing the positions of the<br>
punctured bits is simulated in a manner that decreases the change of BER at each bit<br>
position of the rate-matched block and thus improves BLER performance. The<br>
following rate matching patterns are available.<br>
Rate matching pattern={ 1, 3, 7, 59, 63, 66} or {1, 4, 10, 59, 63, 66}<br>
The elements of each of the rate matching patterns represent the positions of bits to be<br>
punctured among the channel-coded bits #1 to #66. Given a 10-ms E-AGCH TTI, the 2-<br>
ms E-AGCH TTI occurs five times.<br>
With reference to FIG. 3, a Node B transmitter for transmitting the E-AGCH according<br>

operating the 16-bit CRC with a 16-bit UE-ID for identifying the UE to receive the AG,<br>
and then combines the UE-ID specific CRC with the AG, thereby producing 25-bit<br>
control information.<br>
The channel encoder 308, which uses a convolutional code with a constraint length of 9<br>
and a coding rate 1/2, adds eight tail bits to the 25-bit control information and<br>
convolutionally encodes the 33-bit information to a 66-bit coded block. The rate<br>
matcher 310 punctures the 66-bit coded block in a predetermined rate matching pattern.<br>
The physical channel mapper 312 maps the rate-matched block to a physical channel<br>
frame configured to be suitable for 2-ms E-AGCH TTTs. Thus, the control information<br>
is transmitted on the E-AGCH 314.<br>
Meanwhile, the control information transmission controller 316 controls transmission of<br>
the control information for an E-DCH through the UE-ID specific CRC adder 304, the<br>
channel encoder 308, the rate matcher 310, and the physical channel mapper 312. The<br>
control information transmission controller 316 stores at least one of the above rate<br>
matching patterns and applies a preset one of the rate matching patterns to the rate<br>
matcher 310.<br>
With reference to FIG. 4, a UE receiver for receiving the E-AGCH according to the<br>
tenth exemplary embodiment of the present invention will be described.<br>
Referring to FIG. 4, the UE receives a signal on the E-AGCH 402. The physical channel<br>
demapper 404 extracts a rate-matched block from a 2-ms TTI in the received signal.<br>
The rate dematcher 406 recovers (i.e. depunctures) the bits punctured by the rate<br>
matcher 310 for the rate-matched block according to the rate matching pattern used in<br>
the rate matcher 310 of the Node B. If the E-AGCH 402 uses a 10-ms TTI with five<br>
repeated 2-ms TTIs, the physical channel demapper 404 and the rate dematcher 406<br>
perform the same operation five times and combine the resulting coded sub-blocks to<br>
one coded block.<br>
The channel decoder 408 decodes the coded block received from the rate dematcher 406.<br>
The coded block is divided into a 9-bit AG and a 16-bit UE-ID specific CRC. The UE-<br>
ID specific CRC extractor 410 extracts a 16-bit CRC by modulo-2 operating the 16-bit<br>
UE-ID specific CRC with the 16-bit UE-ID 412 of the UE, and provides the extracted<br>
CRC and the AG to the CRC checker 414. The CRC checker 414 checks the 16-bit<br>
CRC to detect errors from the AG. If the CRC check passes, the CRC checker 414<br>
outputs the error-free AG 416. The AG 416 is used for determining an allowed<br>
maximum data rate for E-DCH data. If the CRC check fails, the AG is discarded.<br>
Meanwhile, the control information reception controller 418 controls the reception of the<br>
control information for the E-DCH through the physical channel demapper 404, the rate<br>
dematcher 406, the channel decoder 408, the UE-ID specific CRC extractor 410, and the<br>
CRC checker 414.<br>

A rate matching pattern for a 10-bit AG is provided as an example of an implementation<br>
of the present invention. For instance, the AG includes an 8-bit allowed maximum data<br>
rate representing the maximum amount of uplink radio resources available to a UE or an<br>
8-bit power offset equivalent to the allowed maximum data rate, a 1-bit AG validity<br>
duration indicator indicating how long the AG is valid, and a 1-bit AG validity process<br>
indicator indicating whether the AG is valid for one particular HARQ process or an<br>
entire HARQ process. Or the AG includes a 9-bit allowed maximum data rate or power<br>
offset and a 1-bit AG validity duration indicator.<br>
In a third example, the AG includes a 9-bit allowed maximum data rate or power offset<br>
and a 1-bit AG validity process indicator. Or the AG is configured to include an allowed<br>
maximum data rate or power offset, an AG validity duration indicator, an AG validity<br>
process indicator, and other E-AGCH control bits in a total often bits.<br>
Besides the AG, the E-AGCH carries a UE-ID for identifying a UE and a CRC for<br>
detecting errors from the AG. The UE-ID and the CRC each have 16 bits and modulo-2<br>

with the UE-ID. This 16-bit CRC is called a UE-ID specific CRC. The UE can<br>
determine whether a received AG is intended for the UE by the UE-ID specific CRC.<br>
Eight tail bits are added to 26-bit control information with the 10-bit AG concatenated to<br>
the 16-bit UE-ID specific CRC and convolutionally encoded with a constraints length of<br>
9 at a coding rate of 1/2. As a result, one channel-coded block being a 68-bit coded bit<br>
stream is produced. 8 bits are punctured from the 68-bit channel-coded block for<br>
transmission in a 2-ms E-AGCH TTI to which an SF of 256 and QPSK apply, creating a<br>
60-bit rate-matched block. A rate matching pattern representing the positions of the<br>
punctured bits is simulated in a manner that decreases the change of BER at each bit<br>

The elements of each of the rate matching patterns represent the positions of bits to be<br>
punctured among the channel-coded bits #1 to #68. Given a 10-ms E-AGCH TTI, the 2-<br>
ms E-AGCH TTI occurs five times.<br>

increase the transmission reliability of an AG indicating the absolute value of an allowed<br>
maximum data rate for a UE by providing a rate matching pattern that reduces a BER<br>
variation at each bit position within a block and thus may improve BLER performance.<br>
In addition, lower power consumption may be required for the same BLER performance<br>
and as a result, uplink interference may be reduced.<br>
