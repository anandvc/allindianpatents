Introduction.<br>
The invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of l-Methylindazole-3-carboxylic acid useful for the preparation of pharmaceutical^ active compound granisetron. 1-Methylindazole-3-carboxylic acid (II) and granisetron have the following formulae.<br><br>
Background of invention:<br>
The literature method for the preparation of l-Methylindazole-3-carboxylic acid [Ref; (i) Chem. Ber. 1919, 52, 1340 (ii) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1950,72,3047] involves methylation of the indazole derivative of the formula IV.<br><br>
Which gives a roughly equal mixture of two products of the formulae (V) and (VI) containing the methyl group at either 1- or 2- position. The mixture of the products, then, has to be separated by chromatographic methods and then the required 1-Methyl isomer hydrolyzed to give the compound of the formula (II) resulting in low yield. This process is shown in scheme-I.<br><br><br>
Another process is disclosed in (EP 323105, 1988, Beecham group) which claims a high yielding one-stage process avoiding the need for separation of the isomers. This method involves methylation of indazole-3-carboxylic acid of the formula (I) employing methylating agents like dimethyl sulfate or methyl iodide in a polar solvent in the presence of a alkali metal alkoxide like sodium isopropoxide. The product l-Methylindazole-3-carboxylic acid is claimed in 85-90% yield. The isomeric purity of the compound of the formula-II is not mentioned in this patent. This process is shown in scheme-2.<br><br>
On repetition of the above method (scheme-2) disclosed in EP 0323105, we observed the following short-comings:<br>
1) The yield of l-methyl-indazole-3-carboxylic acid of the formula (II) obtained is only about 37% as against the 85-90% claimed.<br><br>
2)	The method, in fact, produces a mixture of the isomeric compounds of the formulae (II)<br>
and (III) and other impurities, which has to be purified by solvent extraction employing ethyl acetate and 4-Methyl-2-pentanone,<br><br>
3)	The purity of the compound of the formula (II) generated after purification is only about<br>
93%. The remaining 7% constitute the impurity isomeric 2-Methyl-indazole-carboxylic acid of the formula (III) and other impurities which still stays along with the final product as contaminant.<br>
4)	The resulting product of the formula (II) produced by this process is thus unsuitable for<br>
the preparation of pharmaceutical grade granisetron as the isomeric impurity of the formula (III) also participates in further steps and almost impossible to separate afterwards.<br>
For the preparation of pharmaceutical grade granisetron it is required to synthesize the intermediate of the formula (II) in high isomeric purity (&gt;99.8%). As explained above the existing prior art processes including the one disclosed in EP 0323105 are far from satisfactory. Therefore we continued our relentless investigations in developing an industrially feasible, dependable process for the preparation of high purity (&gt;99.8%).l-Methyl-indazole-3-carboxylic acid of the formula (II) consistently.<br>
Therefore the main objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the preparation of high purity (&gt;99.8%) l-Methyl-indazole-3-carboxylic acid of the formula (II) consistently, which is useful for the preparation of pharmaceutical grade granisetron<br><br>
Summary of the invention:<br>
While carrying out the investigations towards developing the improved process for the preparation of high purity (&gt;99.8%) l-Methyl-indazole-3-carboxylic acid of the formula (II) we observed surprisingly that Indazole-3-carboxylic acid can be converted to l-methyl-indazole-3-carboxylic and by adopting the simple procedure as shown in scheme-3<br><br><br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides an improved process for the preparation of highly pure l-Methyl-indazole-3- carboxylic acid of the formula (II)<br><br>
Useful for the preparation of pharmaceutical grade granisetron which comprises<br>
(a)	methylating Indazole -3-carboxylic acid of the formula (I) using dimethylsulfate in the<br>
presence of a base to produce a mixture of l-Methyl-indazole-3-carboxylic Acid of the<br>
formula (II) and 2-Methyl-indazole-3 -carboxylic acid of the formula (III)<br><br>
(ID	on)<br>
(b)	Preferential esterification of the compound of formula (II) over the compound of formula (III) in methanol medium containing 1 to 10% Cone. Sulfuric acid at a temperature in the range of 35Â°C to reflux temperature of methanol for a period of 1 to 6 hrs.<br>
(c)	Isolating the esterified l-Methyl-indazole-3-carboxylic acid from the unesterified 2-Methyl-indazole-3-carboxylic acid by crystallisation of the ester or by purification technique such as washing with a base and.<br>
(d)	Hydrolysing the ester of the acid of the formula (II) by conventional methods.<br>
The l-Methyl-indazole-3-carboxylic acid of the formula (II) thus isolated in more than 99.8% purity (by HPLC) and is suitable for conversion to pharmaceutical grade granisetron.<br><br>
