Field of Invention:<br>
The present invention is in relation to the use of glycerophosphoinositols for the preparation of a therapeutical drug for the inhibition of the release of arachidonic acid, new derivatives with glycerophosphoinositolic structure and their preparation, Phosphohpases are enzymes that catalyze the hydrolysis of membrane phospholipids and are classified according the type of chemical bond involved, in phospholipase Al, A2, B, C, D.<br>
Background and Prior art of the Invention:<br>
In mammals, the mobilization of arachidonic acid from the sn2 ester bond of phospholipids is greatly due to the activation of cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) following the receptor activation induced by a number of agonists including hormones, neurotransmitters, neuropathies and growth factors.<br>
Considering the mechanism of PLA2 activation via the agonist-receptor interaction, the G-proteins have been proposed to mediate the receptor induced activation through two distinct mechanisms: (i) direct interaction with the PLA2, since it is well known that the treatment with prussic toxin reduces its enzymatic activity; or (ii) indirectly mediated through phospholipase C (PLC) activation, phosphorilation and activation of the PLA2 by the Mitogen Activated Protein Kinases (MAPK).<br>
A research article by E. Armanda- Burgermeister, U. Tibes, B. M. Kaiser, W. G. Friebe, W. V. Schemer, entitled "Suppression of Cytokine synthesis, integrand expression and chronic inflammation by inhibitors of cytosolic phospholipase<br>
A2"Europ. J. Pharmacol., 326 (1997) 237 - 250).Two isoforms of the phospholipase A2 have been identified in mammals, a 14 kDa secretory form and a 85 kDa cytosolic form (cPLA2) which do not share amino acid sequence homology and differ in their catalytic and regulatory mechanisms. The cytosolic phospholipase A2 is located in the cytosol of quiescent cells, for example platelets and   leucocytes:   lipopolisaccharide,   thrombin   or   cytokines   (for   example<br><br>
Interleukin Iph), Tumor Necrosis Factor a, but also neuropeptides such as tachikinins, bradikinins or neurotransmitters such as purines, particularly ATP, and serotoninergic, adrenergic and muscarinic agonists activate the enzyme leading to an increase of the intracellular calcium levels and a rapid phosphorilation of the enzyme by protein Kinase C and a subsequent translocation to the plasma membrane where it binds to the phospholipid substrate. These mediators also induce the de novo synthesis of the enzyme. However, the article does not disclose the aspects of the instant invention and is no where related to the application of instant invention.<br>
A research article entitled "Glycerophosphoinositol - 4 - phosphate in intracellular signaling** C. P. Barrie, M. Alaska, A. Carvel, C. lyrics and D. Croda, in Bioactive Lipids, Vander bock YY/ed. Plenum Publishing Corporation New York, 1998. The tight intermediations of the G protein, PKC, cPLA2 systems and the involvement of the cPLA2 in the production of lipid and lysolipid mediators make the PLA2 a potentially important pharmacological target. However, the citation does not disclose the application of instant invention and there is no motivation for the applicant from the citation to arrive at the application of instant invention.<br>
The applicant has now originally found that a substance generated concomitantly with the release of arachidonic acid, that is L-a-glycero-phospho-D-mio- inositol (GPI), is an autacoids and, furthermore, its potassium, calcium and zinc salts and other new derivatives and analogues obtained by chemical semi synthesis and having the general formula (I) subsequently described, exert a potent inhibitory effect on the release of arachidonic acid via a negative modulation of the PLA2 in vitro activation and can be effectively used for the treatment of pathologies mediated by the activation of PLA2 as following described.<br><br>

Evaluation of the effects of the L- a -glycero- phospho-D-mio-inositol autacoid coded example 3, example 4 and example 4a on the release of arachidonic acid induced by cPLA2 in various cellular systems.<br>
Experimental Models<br>
Cell Cultures<br>
FRTLSj cell line of epithelial cells from rat thyroid grown in culture. Briefly, the cells were cultured in Coon's F12 medium modified according to Ham and supplemented with 5% bovine serum, 20 mM glutamine and a mixture of six hormones (6H-thyrotropin, insulin, transferring, Cortisol, somatostatin, glicil-L-istidil-L- lysine acetate) at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere in 5% C02,95% air medium changed every 3-4 days.<br>
Swiss 3T3 Fibroblasts<br>
The cultures are stimulated to release arachidonic acid using various stimuli:<br>
cPLA2-dependent mechanism, for example ATP, mastoparan, bombesin;<br>
cPLA2-indipendent mechanism, for example Ca2+ ionophore, ionomicin. Test Release of Arachidonic Acid.<br>
The cells are initially incubated with various concentrations of the compound under examination for 60 minutes or with a predefined concentration of 100 pM for various time intervals (15-180 minutes), washed two times with HBSS (Hank's Balanced Salt Solution, in the presence of Ca2+ and Mg2+ ions) added with 10 mMHepes and 0.2% BSA - in absence of free fatty acids, pH 7.4 and<br><br>
stimulated with 100 FM ATP in the described buffer for 10 minutes at 37°C. The supernatant was collected in scintillation cuvettes for determination. The results are expressed as a percentage of the total release of [3H]-arachidonic acid.<br>
Results<br>
The compound under evaluation coded as example 4a has been shown to reduce in a time and concentration dependent manner the release of arachidonic acid induced by the activation of the cPLA2 in all the cellular systems in which the test has been performed (Table 1,2, 3,4,5)<br>
The compounds coded as examples 3 and example 4 show a more potent effect (Table 6)<br>
On the contrary, compound example 4a does not induce reduction of the release<br>
of arachidonic acid induced by stimuli not related to cPLA2, such as calcium<br>
ionophore (Table 7).<br>
All together, the reported data show that the compound of example 4a and the compound of example 3 and example 4 are able to limit the release of arachidonic acid according to a mechanism specifically mediated by the negative regulation of the activating pathway of the cytosolic cPLA2, in other words of the main pathway involved in the mobilization of arachidonic acid.<br>

Evaluation of the protective activity on the local inflammation induced by the peptide P6-11 of substance P versus Substance P.<br>
Experimental Model<br>
Balb /c mice of female gender, of about 20-22 g, maintained in normal conditions light/dark cycles and fed "ad libitum", are anaesthetized by exposure to a ethyl-ether saturated atmosphere. The animals are then divided in 4 groups of 10 animals each.<br>
The capillary permeability is induced by means of a subcutaneous injection into the left ear pinna of substance P (1 pmole/3pl) or of its peptide fragment P6- 11 (1 pmole/31) ; the control received an injection of saline solution (Mazzari et al. Eur. J. Pharm. 1996).<br>
Plasma extravasation in the ear pinna of the mouse.<br>
The mice receive an endovenous injection of Evan's Blue (100 mg/kg) immediately after the substance P or the e P6-11 peptide and were sacrificed two hours later. The dye was then extracted by an homogenization (Polytron homogenizer) of the injected ear pinna in 2 ml of formammide. The homogenized tissue was then incubated at SC’C for 2 hours. The plasma extravasation was measured as optical density of the Evan's Blue at 620 nm (A620), according to the method of Saria and Lunberg (1983).<br>
Solubilization and administration of the compounds<br>
The compounds described in the examples have been solubilized in a 0.9% saline solution and administered by endovenous injection at doses ranging between 0.5 and 5 mg/kg 30 minutes before capillary permeabilization.<br>
Results<br>
The extravasation induced by substance P is due to a dual activation mechanism of both the mast cells and the vasal endothelial cells, while the substance P<br><br>
fragment- peptide P6-11-causes extravasation only due to an effect on the endothelium through the interaction with the NKl receptors ("Role of the N-terminal arginine in the histamine releasing activity of substance P, bradikinin and related peptides" ; Deviller P., Drapeau G., Renoux M., Regoli D., Europ. J. Pharmacol. 168 (1989): 53-60.).<br>
All the tested compounds significantly reduce the capillary permeability induced by the peptide P6-11, while not significantly affecting the permeability induced by SP (Table 9).<br>
In particular, the potassium salt of GPI of Example 5a limits the extravasation<br>
induced by the substance P fragment P6-11.<br>
Table 7: The compounds coded Examples 4a, and 6 limit the extravasation induced by P6-11.<br><br><br><br>
The reported evidences show that the compounds of the invention limit the plasma protein extravasation induced by the terminal peptide of substance P, P6-11. The peptide P6-11 induces a protein extravasation through the epithelium according to a specific mechanism mediated by the neurokin receptor termed NKl. It must be recalled that the NKl, NK2, and NK3 receptors mediate the signal of the endogenous ligands SP, NKA, and NKB respectively, all of which recognize the terminal portion of SP present to the peptide P6-11.<br>
In conclusion, the tested compounds of the invention are capable to negatively modulate the cPLA2 and thus to limit the cascade of events related to the arachidonic acid metabolism. The compounds of the invention are furthermore capable to limit the activation of the cPLA2 and the increase of arachidonic acid levels present in situations of altered barrier permeability such as the vasal-perineurium of the peripheral nervous system and the blood-brain barrier of the central nervous system induced by various stimuli, for example ATP.<br>
The compounds of the invention modulate also the activation of the cPLA2 mediated by the bombesin receptors, which is involved in the disregulation of food intake and may thus be helpfully used for the treatment of pathologies mediated by such a cachexia mechanism, for example bulimia, anorexia, obesity and cachexia.<br>
The compounds of the invention are ftirthermore capable to modulate the stimulation of the NK-1 receptor of an in vivo model.<br><br>
The compounds of the invention can thus be a valid therapeutic tool for the treatment of pathologies mediated by an activation or over stimulation of the cPLA2, as those previously listed.<br>
The dosages, timing and the ways of administration will be chosen according to the type, stage, seriousness and district of appearance of the pathology or alteration or of the eventual application in human or veterinarian health care and comprised between 0.1 and 100 mg/kg for 3-90 days for each therapy cycle. For all the pathologies mentioned are indicated the systemic, parenteral, oral and rectal administration, but also topic, transdermic and in any case such that to achieve the highest availability of the active substance. For oral formulations are privileged administrations as tablets, sugar coated tablets and capsules, but also powders and solutions/suspensions including nebulization.<br>
For topic treatments are preferred gels, creams and solutions compatible with skin and mucosal use, including the gingival mucosa, together with eye drops for the administration into the conjunctival sac.<br>
The injectable forms are formulated with solvents compatible for pharmaceutical use and for the endovenous, intramuscular and subcutaneous administration.<br>
The same active compounds can be formulated at the proper concentrations, as supplements for oral intake for the prevention or coadiuvant treatment of alterations related to disreactive conditions in man and veterinarian medicine.
