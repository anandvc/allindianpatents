Example VII. Insecticidal Testing<br>
The compounds identified in the foregoing examples were tested against cotton aphid using procedures described hereinafter.<br>
Insecticidal test for cotton aphid (Aphis f^ossypii) in foliar spray assay<br>
Squash with fully expanded cotyledon leaves were trimmed to one cotyledon per plant and infested with cotton aphid (wingless adult and nymph) 1 day prior to chemical application. Each plant was examined before chemical application to ensure proper infestation (ca. 30-70 aphids per plant). Compounds (2 mg) were dissolved in 2 ml of acetone : methanol (1:1) solvent, forming stock solutions of 1000 ppm. The 'sock solutions were diluted 5X with 0,025% Tween 20 in H2O to obtain a solution at 200 ppm. Lower concentrations (50, 12.5, 3.125, 0.781 and 0.195 ppm) were prepared by making sequential 4X dilutions from the 200 ppm solution with a diluent consisting 80 parts of 0.025% Tween 20 in H2O and 20 parts of acetone : methanol (1 : 1). A hand-held Devilbiss sprayer was used to apply the spray solutions until runoff to both sides of the squash cotyledon leaves. Four plants (4 replications) were used for each concentration of each compound. Reference plants (solvent check) were sprayed with the diluent only. Treated plants were held in a holding room for 3 days at approximately 23 °C and 40% RH before the number of live aphids on each plant was recorded. Insecticidal activity was measured by Corrected % Control using Abbott's correction formula and presented in Table 1:<br>
Corrected % Control = 100 * (X - Y) / X where X = No. of live aphids on solvent check plants Y = No. of live aphids on treated plants<br>

Insecticidal test for green peach aphid (Myzus persicae) in foliar spray assay<br>
Cabbage seedlings grown in 3-inch pots, with 2-3 small (3-5 cm) true leaves, were used as test substrate. The seedlings were infested with 20-50 green peach aphids (wingless adult and nymph) 2-3 days prior to chemical application. Four seedlings were used for each treatment. Compounds (2 mg) were dissolved in 2 ml of acetone : methanol (1 : 1) solvent, fonning stock solutions of 1000 ppm. The stock solutions were diluted 5X with 0.025% Tween 20 in H2O to obtain a solution at 200 ppm. Lower concentrations (50, 12.5, 3.125 and 0.781 ppm) were prepared by making sequential 4X dilutions from the 200 ppm solution with a diluent consisting 80 parts of 0.025% Tween 20 in H2O and 20 parts of acetone : methanol (1 : 1). A hand-held Devilbiss sprayer was used for spraying a solution to both sides of cabbage leaves until runoff. Reference plants (solvent check) were sprayed with the diluent only. Treated plants were held in a holding room for three days at approximately 23 °C and 40% RH prior to grading. Evaluation was conducted by counting the number of live aphids per plant under a microscope.   Insecticidal activity was measured by using Abbott's correction formula:<br>
Corrected % Control = 100 * (X - Y) / X where X = No. of live aphids en solvent check plants Y = No. of liv£ aphids on treated plants<br>

In each case of Table 2 the rating scale is the same as that used for Table 1.<br>
Compound 2 was selected for further testing against sweet potato whitefly, brown planthopper and green leafhopper using procedures described hereinafter. Results are shown in Tables 3 and 4.<br>
Insecticidal test for sweet potato whiteflv (Bemisia tabaci) in foliar spray assay<br>
This test was designed to measure the capability of whitefly eggs and/or young nymphs to develop to large nymphs. Cotton seedlings at the growth stage of one or two expanding true leaf were trimmed so that only the first true leaf remained (cotyledon leaves were also removed). The plants were pre-infested with sweet potato whitefly eggs by keeping plants next to the colony-keeping plants for two days. The infested plants were carefully checked for presence of similar egg density before use in the insecticidal tests. Master solutions of test compounds at 1000 ppm were prepared in acetone : methanol(l : 1).   The 12.5 ppm spray solutions were then made by diluting 0.188 mL of the master solution with 14.812 ml of 0.025% Tween 20 in water. The lower concentrations were made by diluting the 12.5 ppm spray solution with a diluent consisting 98.75 parts of 0.025% Tween 20 in water and 1.25 parts of acetone : methanol (1 ; 1). The diluent was used as solvent control. The test solutions were sprayed with a handheld Devilbiss sprayer until runoff to both sides of the infested cotton leaves. Four plants (4 repUcations) were used for each trcatxnent. Treatea plants were held in a holding room for 12 days at approximately 23 °C and 40% RH before evaluation. To evaluate the efficacy of the compounds, the number of live large nymphs in an area of 1 square inch on the lower surface of the treated cotton leaves was counted under a microscope. Insecticidal activity was determined by Corrected % Control using Abbott's correction formula and presented in Table 3:<br>
Corrected % Control = 100* (X - Y) / X where X -- No of Live large nymphs on solvent check plants Y = No. of live large nymphs on treated plants<br>

Insecticidal test for brown planthopper (Nilaparvata lusens) and preen leafhopper (Nephotettix sp)<br>
A root-uptake systemic assay was performed on both brown planthopper and green leafhopper. Four-week-old rice seedlings were submerged in 3-cm depth of water in the bottom portion (high 5 cm, diameter 3 cm) of a 2-part glass cylinder (high 18 cm, diameter 3 cm). A metal screen was used to hold the seedlings within the bottom portion. Scotch tape was used to bind the two portions of the cylinder after setting up the seedlings. A metal cap was used to cover the cylinder. There were 4 cylinders for each treatment. The test compound was dissolved in acetone to make a 10,000 ppm stock solution. The stock solution was incorporated at final test concentrations of 10 ppm in the water in which rice seedlings were submerged. Five laboratory-reared 3rd instar nymphs of brown planthopper or green Jeafhopper were introduced into eacti cylinder 3 hr after insecticide application. The treated test units were kept in a growth chamber with conditions set as followings: Temperature 28 ± 0.5 °C; Relative humidity 70 + 0.5 %; Photopeiiod 14 hr light: 8 hr dark. Mortality of hoppers was observed at 2 and 6 days after infestation. The Coxxected % Control values are given in Table 4.<br>

Insecticide Utility<br>
The compounds of the invention are useful for the control of invertebrates including insects. Therefore, the present invention also is directed to a method for inhibiting an insect which comprises applying an insect-inhibiting amount of a compound of formula (I) to a locus of the insect, to the area to be protected, or directly on the insect to be controlled. The compounds of the invention may also be used to control other invertebrate pests such as mites and nematodes.<br>
The "locus" of insects or other pests is a term used herein to refer to the environment in which the insects or other pests live or where their eggs are present, including the air surrounding them, the food they eat, or objects which they contact. For example, insects which eat, damage or contact edible, commodity, ornamental, turf or pasture plants can be controlled by applying the active compounds to the seed of the plant before planting, to the seedling, or cutting which is planted, the leaves, stems, fruits, grain, and/or roots, or to the soil or other growth medium before or after the crop is planted. Protection of these plants against virus, fungus or bacterium diseases may also be achieved indirectly through controlling sap-feeding pests such as whitefly, plant hopper, aphid and spider mite. Such plants include those which are bred through conventional approaches and which are genetically modified using modem biotechnology to<br><br>
gain insect-resistant, herbicide-resistant, nutrition-enhancement, and/or any other beneficial traits.<br>
It is contemplated that the compounds might also be useful to protect' textiles, paper, stored grain. seeds and other foodstuffs, houses and other buildings which may be occupied by humans and/or companion, farm, ranch, zoo, or other animals, by applying an active compound to or near such objects. Domesticated animals, buildings or human beings might be protected with the compounds by controlling invertebrate and/or nematode pests that are parasitic or are capable of transmitting infectious diseases. Such pests include, for example, chiggers, ticks, lice, mosquitoes, flies, fleas and heaitworms.   Nonagronomic applications also include invertebrate pest control in forests, in yards, along road sides and railroad right of way.<br>
The term "inhibiting an insect" refers to a decrease in the numbers of living insects, or a decrease in the number of viable insect eggs. The extent of reduction accomplished by a compound depends, of course, upon the application rate of the compound, the particular compound used, and the target insect species. At least an inactivating amount should be used. The term "insect-inactivating amount" is used to describe the amount, which is sufficient to cause a measurable reduction in the treated insect population. Generally an amount in the range from about 1 to about 1000 ppm by weight active compound is used. For example, insects or other pests which can be inhibited include, but are not limited to:<br>

Compositions<br>
The compounds of this invention are applied in the form of compositions which are important embodiments of the invention, and which comprise a compound of this invention and a phyioicgically-acceptable uiert carrier. Control<br>
•of the pests is achieved by applying compounds of the invention in forms of sprays, topical treatment, gels, seed coatings, microcapsulations, systemic uptake, baits, eartags, boluses, foggers, fumigants aerosols, dusts and many others. The compositions are either concentrated solid or liquid formulations which are dispersed in water for application, or are dust or granular formulations which are applied without further treatment. The compositions are prepared according to procedures and formulae which are conventional in the agricultural chemical art, but which are novel and important because of the presence therein of the compounds of this invention. Some description of the formulation of the compositions will be given, however, to assure that agricultural chemists can readily prepare any desired, composition.<br>
The dispersions in which the compounds are applied are most often aqueous suspensions or emulsions prepared from concentrated formulations of the compounds. Such water-soluble, water-suspendable or emulsifiable formulations are either solids, usually known as wettable powders, or liquids usually known as emulsifiable concentrates or aqueous suspensions. Wettable powders, which may be compacted to form water dispersible granules, comprise an intimate mixture of the active compound, an inert carrier, and surfactants. The concentration of the active compound is usually from about 10% to about 90% by weight. The inert carrier is usually chosen from among the attapulgite clays, the montmorillonite clays, the diatomaceous earths, or the purified silicates. Effective surfactants, comprising from about 0.5% to about 10% of the wettable powder, are found among the sulfonated lignins, the condensed naphthalenesulfonates, the naphthalenesulfonates, the alkylbenzenesulfonates, the alkyl sulfates, and nonionic surfactants such as ethylene oxide adducts of alkyl phenols.<br>
Emulsifiable concentrates of the compounds comprise a convenient concentration of a compound, such as from about 50 to about 500 grams per liter of liquid, equivalent to about 10% to about 50%, dissolved in an Jne.t carrier<br>
which is either a water miscible solvent or a mixture of water-immiscible organic solvent and emulsifiers. Useful organic solvents include aromatics, especially the xylenes, and the petroleum fractions, especially the high-boiling naphthalenic and olcfinic portions of petroleum such as heavy aromatic naphtha. Other organic solvents may also be used, such as the terpenic solvents including rosin derivatives, aliphatic ketones such as cyclohexanone, and complex alcohols such as 2-ethoxyethanol. Suitable emulsifiers for emulsifiable concentrates are chosen from conventional anionic and /or nonionic surfactants, such as those discussed above.<br>
Aqueous suspensions comprise suspensions of water-insoluble compounds of this invention, dispersed in an aqueous vehicle at a concentration in the range from about 5% to about 50% by weight. Suspensions are prepared by finely grinding the compound, and vigorously mixing it into a vehicle comprised of water and surfactants chosen from the same types discussed above. Inert ingredients, such as inorganic salts and synthetic or natural gums, may also be added, to increase the density and viscosity of the aqueous vehicle. It is often most effective to grind and mix the compound at the same time by preparing the aqueous mixture, and homogenizing it in an implement such as a sand mill, ball mill, or piston-type homogenizer.<br>
The compounds may also be applied as granular compositions, which are pzuticularly useful for applications to the soil. Granular compositions usually contain from about 0.5% to about 10% by weight of the compound, dispersed in an inert carrier which consists entirely or in large part of clay or a similar inexpensive substance. Such compositions are usually prepared by dissolving the compound in a suitable solvent and applying it to a granular carrier which has been pre-formed to the appropriate particle size, in the remge of from about 0.5 to 3 mm. Such compositions may also be formulated by making a dough or paste of<br>
the carrier and compound and crushing and drying to obtain the desired granular particle size.<br>
Dusts containing the compounds are prepared simply by intimately mixing the compound in powdered form with a suitable dusty agricultural carrier, such as kaolin clay, ground volcanic rock, and the like. Dusts can suitably contain from about 1% to about 10% of the compound.<br>
It is equally practical, when desirable for any reason, to apply the compound in the form of a solution in an appropriate organic solvent, usually a bland petroleum oil, such as the spray oils, which are widely used in agricultural chemistry.<br>
Insecticides and acaricides are generally applied in the form of a dispersion of the active ingredient in a liquid carrier. It is conventional to refer to application rates in terms of the concentration of active ingredient in the carrier. The most widely used carrier is water.<br>
The compounds of the invention can also be applied in the form of £ui aerosol composition. In such compositions the active compound is dissolved or dispersed in an inert carrier, which is a pressure-generating propellant mixture. The aerosol composition is packaged in a container from which the mixture is dispensed through an atomizing valve. Propellant mixtures comprise either low-boiling halocarbons, which may be mixed with organic solvents, or aqueous suspensions pressurized with inert gases or gaseous hydrocarbons.<br>
The actual amount of compound to be applied to loci of insects and mites is not critical and can readily be determined by those skilled in the art in view of the examples above. In general, concentrations from 10 ppm to 5000 ppm by weight of compound are expected to provide good control. With many of the compounds, concentrations from 100 to 1500 ppm will suffice.<br>
The locus to which a compound is applied can be any locus inhabited by an insect or mite, for example, vegetable crops, fruit and nut trees, grape vines, ornamental plants, domesticated animals, the interior or exterior surfaces of buildings, and the soil around buildings.<br>
Because of the unique ability of insect eggs to resist toxicant action, repeated applications may be desirable to control newly emerged larvae, as is true of other known insecticides and acaricides.<br>
Systemic movement of compounds of the invention in plants may be utilized to control pests on one portion of the plant by applying the compounds to a different portion of it. For example, control of foliar-feeding insects can be controlled by drip irrigation or furrow application, or by treating the seed before planting. Seed treatment can be applied to all types of seeds, including those from which plants genetically transformed to express specialized traits will germinate. Representative examples include those expressing proteins toxic to invertebrate pests, such as Bacillus thuringiensis or other insecticidal proteins, those expressing herbicide resistance, such as "Roundup Ready®" seed, or those with "stacked" foreign genes expressing insecticidal proteins, herbicide resistance, nutrition-enhancement and/or any other beneficial traits.<br>
An insecticidal bait composition consisting of compounds of the present invention and attractants and/or feeding stimulants may be used to increase efficacy of the insecticides against insect pest in a device such as trap, bait station, and the like. The bait composition is usually a solid, semi-solid (including gel) or liquid bait matrix including the stimulants and one or more non-microencapsulated or microencapsulated insecticides in an amount effective to act as kill agents.<br>
The compounds of the present invention (Formula I) are often applied in conjunction with one or more other insecticides or fungicides or herbicides to obtain control of a wider variety of pests diseases and weeds. When used in conjunction with other insecticides or fungicides or herbicides, the presently claimed compounds can be formulated with the other insecticides or fungicides or herbicide, tank mixed with the other insecticides or fungicides or herbicides, or applied sequentially with the other insecticides or fungicides or herbicides.<br>
