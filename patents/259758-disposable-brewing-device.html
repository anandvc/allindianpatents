 DISPOSABLE BREWING DEVICE<br><br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a disposable package for brewing of e.g. coffee or<br>
tea according to claim 1.<br>
Technical background and prior art<br>
A coffee maker such as described in USD448602S constitutes both a coffee maker<br>
and a coffee pot in one device. However this kind of coffee maker requires cleaning<br>
after use and is not well-suited for one-time-use. The equipment is too expensive and<br>
is per se not suitable for disposal.<br>
An example of a device for one-time-use related to the making of coffee is<br>
US4886674 disclosing a beverage making cartridge made of an air- and water-<br>
impermeable material and containing a product, which provides a beverage such as<br>
soup, chocolate and coffee when mixed in aqueous medium. A web material is<br>
located in the sachet below the product. When using the sachet, pressurized liquid is<br>
introduced from the top of the sachet, into the sachet and through the sachet and the<br>
web material, whereby the bottom of the sachet is opened. The sachet may eventually<br>
be provided with a nozzle in the top of the sachet. A drawback of this invention is<br>
that pressurized liquid is required in order to utilize the device and dedicated<br>
equipment is needed for using it. Thus, a handheld-based brewing of coffee is not<br>
applicable.<br>
One problem is to be able to make coffee of good and uniform quality without a<br>
machine or a coffee pot or a conventional coffee filter and funnel. This problem has<br>
at least partly been dealt with in US5842408, which describes a solution in which a<br>
package contains a filter and a foldable funnel suited for arbitrary drinking cups. The<br>
illustrated solution suffers from the drawback that it is expensive to manufacture as<br><br>
the foldable funnel frame forms a body separate from the outer bag,, thereby<br>
complicating the manufacturing process.<br>
One of several problems addressed by the invention is a reduction in manufacturing<br>
costs, both with respect to the manufacturing process and with respect to<br>
consumption of materials needed for the device.<br>
Another problem addressed by the invention is to avoid necessity of specialized<br>
brewing equipment.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
The invention relates to a disposable brewing device 1 comprising<br>
at least one inner compartment 2<br>
said inner compartment being formed by a liquid-permeable material 4 and.<br>
containing aroma material 5,<br>
at least one outer compartment forming a brewing container 3<br>
said brewing container being formed by a liquid-impermeable material 6,<br>
said at least one liquid-permeable inner compartment 2 being integrated within said<br>
brewing container 3,<br>
The inner compartment integrated within the brewing container is preferably located<br>
inside the brewing container and fastened hereto. This among other things<br>
contributes to the important advantage of the present invention that the brewing<br>
device is ready for use and no equipment is needed to support it during use.<br>
Preferably, the disposable brewing device is intended to use with liquid such as water<br><br>
or e.g. alcohol or milk. In the present invention a disposable device is defined as a<br>
device intended for one or a few times of use,<br>
The liquid-permeable material needs no support as it is fastened to the brewing<br>
container.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, said outer compartment 3 is formed by film<br>
material.<br>
A film material according to the invention may comprise both a single and/or a<br>
multi-layer structure. The layers may be laminated, mutually welded, or generally<br>
gathered. Preferably, the inner layer of a multi-layer film may comprise a so-called<br>
sealant facilitating the desired brewing device defining gatherings.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention said brewing device comprises a substantially air,<br>
aroma-, and liquid-impermeable outer sealing.<br>
The outer sealing forms a barrier between the outer environment and the<br>
environment inside the sealing. Hereby the aroma material contained is protected and<br>
its shelf life prolonged.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention said brewing container is forming the outer<br>
sealing of the brewing device.<br>
In a preferred embodiment no separate outer sealing 41 is needed, as the liquid-<br>
impermeable material of the brewing compartment 3 itself forms a sealed barrier for<br>
air comprising gasses such as oxygen, aroma and liquid such as water or moisture.<br>
When the brewing container itself forms the outer sealing both material- and<br>
production-expenses in supplying an extra wrapping are saved.<br><br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the inner compartment material, the brewing<br>
container material and the outer sealing are formed as bags or pouches.<br>
It is an advantage of the present invention that the bag-like characteristic implies that<br>
the whole brewing device before use appears as a flat package, whereby it takes up<br>
only a small amount of space.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention the brewing container 3 and the inner<br>
compartment 2 and the outer sealing are formed from sheets, webs, rolls or lengths of<br>
structural material.<br>
Generally forming all parts of the brewing device out of e.g. webs of structural<br>
material contributes to a simple and cost saving manufacturing process.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention the brewing container and/ot the inner<br>
compartment may each be formed out of one single sheet of structural material. In a<br>
further embodiment two, three or more sheets of material are assembled to form the<br>
brewing container and/or the inner compartment.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention said bags or pouches forming the brewing<br>
container 3, the inner compartment 2 and the outer sealing are assembled by<br>
weldings at the edges.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention the heat resistance of the structural material of the<br>
brewing container 3 and inner compartment material 4 is up to at least 100 °C.<br>
The inner compartment material and the outer compartment material are<br>
advantageously resistant to the temperature of boiling water.<br><br>
In an embodiment of the invention atmospheric pressure is sufficient for using the<br>
brewing device 1.<br>
In relation to coffee brewing it is an important feature of the brewing device<br>
according to the invention that it enables the user to brew coffee in the traditional<br>
way. The traditional brewing implies that no pressure above the atmospheric pressure<br>
is needed in order to make the water pass through the liquid-permeable material.<br>
Furthermore the brewing device according to the invention advantageously needs no<br>
extra or special equipment to function.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention said liquid-impermeable material comprises walls<br>
and bottom of said brewing container.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention said liquid-impermeable bottom material is more<br>
flexible than said wall material.<br>
The bottom material and wall material may preferably be adjusted according to each<br>
other in order to provide a brewing container, which may expand easily,<br>
In an embodiment of the invention said liquid-impermeable material of the brewing<br>
container comprises at least one film or foil selected from the group of metal foils,<br>
polymer films, metallized or coated films, polymer sealants, polyesters, polyamides<br>
and polyolefines comprising polyethylenes and polypropylenes or any combination<br>
thereof.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention the liquid-impermeable material of the brewing<br>
container 3 has a rigidity, which is large enough to allow the brewing container to be<br>
self-standing.<br><br>
Materials having a high rigidity are preferred in order for the container to be able to<br>
stand by. itself. The side wall material of the outer sealing has a rigidity and heat<br>
stability to secure stability during manufacture and handling of the brewing device.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention the liquid-impermeable material of the brewing<br>
container 3 has a thickness in the range of 10 µm to 2 mm, preferably 40 µm to 500<br>
urn, more preferably 60 mn to 200 µm and most preferably 80 µm to 150 µm.<br>
In dependence of the material chosen the thickness is preferably adjusted in order to<br>
obtain a rigidity, which allows the brewing container to be self-standing.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention the liquid-impermeable material comprises a<br>
multi layer structure.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention a preferred combination of materials for a multi<br>
layer structure for sidewall material and bottom material of the brewing container<br>
may comprise an outside polymer film, an intermediate barrier layer and an inside<br>
layer of polymer sealant (e.g. HDPE).<br>
In an embodiment of the invention said brewing container comprises a translucent or<br>
at least semi-translucent liquid-impermeable material.<br>
The coating of an at least partly translucent brewing container may comprise ceramic<br>
materials such as aluminium oxides, zirconium oxides, glasses based on silicium<br>
oxide or other coating materials such as ethylene vinyl alcohol (EvOH) and<br>
combinations thereof. A translucent brewing container may be of convenience in use<br>
as it is possible to observe the brewing process. The storage capabilities i.e. shelf life<br>
of the' brewing container before use may be reduced, as a translucent material is<br>
obviously not light tight, but a sealing wrapped around the brewing container may<br>
solve this problem.<br><br>
In an embodiment of the invention said translucent or at least semi-translucent<br>
liquid-impermeable material comprises an UV-filter.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention said bottom of the brewing container comprises a<br>
shape sealed fold<br>
The bottom fold enables the container to be self-standing and hence no equipment is<br>
needed to support the brewing device, as the container stands by itself. The shape of<br>
the weld of the bottom fold significantly affects the shape of the brewing container<br>
when filled with liquid, which means that the brewing container during use may<br>
attain e.g. a circular-, oval-, or rectangular-like bottom form.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention the brewing container may comprise alternative<br>
bottom constructions also allowing the brewing container to attain standing abilities.<br>
The bottom construction may e.g. be non-folded.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention said brewing container 3 forms at least a part of<br>
the fixation and support for the inner compartment 2,<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the outer brewing compartment, i.e. the<br>
brewing container forms substantially all of the fixation and support for at least one<br>
of the at least one inner compartments both before and during brewing.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention said brewing container is formed as a stand-up<br>
pouch.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention the brewing container comprises a discharging<br>
arrangement.<br><br>
The discharging arrangement may comprise a pour spout or another kind of small<br>
opening to secure that the beverage may be poured from the brewing container in a<br>
controlled manner with regard to amount and flow of the brewed beverage.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention the brewing container is closed in the top by a<br>
peelable sealing.<br>
The peel-able sealing may e.g. comprise polyethylene, a peelable coating or a<br>
peelable film formed by different techniques. The peelable sealing has the advantage<br>
of forming a barrier for gasses, aroma, moisture, etc, until it is broken.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention the peelable sealing comprises a filmstrip or a<br>
peelable strip of a hot melt type.<br>
The hot melt type peelable strip may be applied to at least one of the mutually facing<br>
surfaces, which are joined to a peelable sealing in the top of the brewing compart-<br>
ment or somewhere in a separate outer sealing. Likewise the peelable strip may be<br>
arranged either in the top or at another suitable location for a peelable sealing, which<br>
is to be broken by the user of the disposable brewing device of the present invention.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention the brewing container is equipped with at least<br>
one handle.<br>
The handle, which may attain different shapes and be mounted to the brewing<br>
container in different ways, may allow the user to lift, move and tilt the brewing<br>
container safely. Still with the objective of making the brewing container easy and<br>
safe to handle it may be preferred to equip the brewing container with two or several<br>
handles.<br><br>
In an embodiment of the invention said brewing container comprises a top closing<br>
arrangement.<br>
The closing arrangement may facilitate re-closing of the brewing container after<br>
liquid has been added. This closing may contribute to the isolation effect of the<br>
brewing container. The brewing container may form a kind of thermos package<br>
keeping the brewed beverage either warm or cold for a considerable time period. The<br>
closing arrangement may further have the effect of preventing loss of beverage, for<br>
example if the brewing container accidentally falls. Moreover the closing<br>
arrangement may contribute to protecting the user of the brewing container from<br>
getting into unwanted contact with the beverage being e.g. hot, sticky, colored etc.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention the closing arrangement comprises a flap, a slide<br>
fastener, an adhesive material or combinations thereof.<br>
The closing arrangement may for example be a flap-solution comprising adhesive<br>
material or non-flap-solution comprising a slide fastener,<br>
In an embodiment of the invention said liquid-permeable inner compartment material<br>
4 comprises punctured etched, melted, stamped or cut plast, polyolefines such as<br>
polyethylene or polypropylene, polyesters, polyamides and other polymers, woven or<br>
non-woven expanded plastic, cloth, screen, wire-mesh, metal or injection molded<br>
plastic.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention said liquid-permeable inner compartment material<br>
4 comprises a film material.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention the liquid-permeable material 4 of the inner<br>
compartment 2 is provided with holes 1, which have been created by stamping,<br>
cutting, etching or melting.<br><br>
The liquid-permeability of the inner compartment material may for example be<br>
obtained by a perforation of small boles 7. The liquid-permeable material, which is<br>
provided with holes, may be described as punctured with a certain density of holes<br>
per cm2.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention the liquid-permeable material 4 is provided with a<br>
density of holes in the range of 1 - 30 holes per cm2, preferably 2-20 holes per cm2<br>
and most preferably 4-12 holes per cm2.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention the holes 7 have dimensions in the range of 0.01<br>
mm • 0.01 mm to 2.00 mm • 2.00 ram, preferably 0.1mm • 0.1 mm to 1.0 mm ■ 1.0<br>
mm, more preferably 0.1mm . 0.1 mm to 0.6 mm . 0.6 mm<br>
The preferred size of the hole is an elongated hole of the size 0.2mm- 0.4 mm. The<br>
shape of the hole may vary from application to application.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention the dimension of the holes 7 is adapted to provide<br>
a brewing time of approximately 3-6 minutes under atmospheric pressure.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention the inner compartment 2 is made of a material<br>
selected from the group of polypropylene, polyethylene, polyesters, polyamides,<br>
polyolefines or other polymers.<br>
Preferably the structural material of the inner compartment is welding compatible<br>
with the sealant of the brewing container.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention said brewing device 1 is formed by mutually<br>
welded film materials.<br><br>
Preferably, the inside of the outer sealing is weldable to the inner compartment<br>
material.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention the inner compartment comprises a pouch.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention the inner compartment is sealed.<br>
It may be preferred to seal the inner compartment, which contains aroma material to<br>
ensure that the aroma material is staying in the inner compartment during transport<br>
and storage. Thereby transfer of aroma material to the outer brewing compartment<br>
i.e. the brewing container is prevented. The sealing may be broken before use, if it is<br>
preferred to add liquid into the inner compartment, e.g. through an opening at the<br>
top.<br>
In a preferred embodiment a specific sealing of the inner compartment is not<br>
required, as the inner compartment may he situated in close vicinity to a sealing in<br>
the top of the outer brewing compartment, and consequently transfer of aroma<br>
material may be prevented by design.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention the inner compartment is open.<br>
It may be an advantage for the user of the brewing device to provide the aroma<br>
material at the time of use. In such case for example there is no need for a sealing of<br>
the inner compartment, as the inner compartment does not contain aroma material<br>
during transport and storage.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention said inner compartment has a volume size in the<br>
range of 10 to 95 % of the brewing container volume, preferably 50 % to 90 % of the<br>
brewing container volume.<br>
The volume size of the inner compartment may be established by different means<br>
such as the size of the inner compartment material sheets, and in a preferred<br><br>
embodiment of the invention by the position of specific weldings in the inner<br>
compartment material. An example of such welding positions is illustrated in figure<br>
17.<br>
The volumes of the inner and outer compartment may be adjusted with respect to<br>
each other in order to create a space for interaction between liquid and aroma<br>
material. E.g.in coffee brewing an infusion process may hereby be facilitated.<br>
Generally different shapes and localizations of the inner compartment may be<br>
provided in order to adjust the flavor concentration and strength of the beverage.<br>
Thereby the design of the brewing device comprising inner and outer compartments<br>
may inherently contribute to the adjustment of a beverage. If the beverage for<br>
example is coffee the design may influence the coffee to be mild, strong etc.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention the inner and outer compartments are designed so<br>
that a large percent of the inner compartment material does not touch the sidewalls or<br>
bottom of the outer compartment.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention said volume size is regulated by the position of a<br>
welding seam in the inner compartment material.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention the brewing device comprises at least two<br>
separate inner compartments arranged inside or alongside each other.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention it may be preferred to equip the brewing device<br>
with more than one inner compartment. The different compartments may be used for<br>
different aroma materials, which are to be mixed during brewing. Their separation in<br>
different compartments secures that they are not mixed before use.<br><br>
In an embodiment of the invention the "brewing container 3 and the inner<br>
compartment 2 are mutually fastened by welding.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention the inner compartment comprises a bottom fold.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention alternative bottom constructions of the inner<br>
compartment, e.g. a non-folded construction may be preferred. According to the<br>
invention the design of the folded or non-folded bottom of the inner compartment<br>
may affect the quality of the brewed beverage, for example by affecting the surface<br>
area of inner compartment material.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention the outer sealing is made of a material selected<br>
from the group of metal foils, polymer films, metallized or coated films, polymer<br>
sealants, polyesters, polyamides and polyolefines comprising polyethylenes and<br>
polypropylenes or any combination thereof.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention said outer sealing comprises a multi layer<br>
structure.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention said outer sealing comprises a laminate.<br>
A laminate composition of the structural material may facilitate a material, which is<br>
light, tight and stabile during manufacturing, storage and handling of the brewing<br>
device.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention the structural material of the brewing container 3<br>
is coated with a protective film and/or a barrier layer.<br>
In case the container material itself is not light-tight it is preferred to coat it in order<br>
to protect the aroma material contained.<br><br>
When the brewing device is packed with aroma material such as ground coffee beans<br>
having a tendency to loose aroma when exposed to the surroundings, it is of crucial<br>
importance that the barrier layer is tight, especially when the amount of aroma<br>
material is relatively small compared to larger coffee packages.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention said outer sealing comprises at least one polymer<br>
film, metallized or coated film, EvOH-coating, metal foil, sealant, or combinations<br>
thereof.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention the multi layer structure of the brewing container<br>
material comprises an outside polymer film, an intermediate barrier layer and an<br>
inside layer of polymer sealant.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention a preferred combination of materials for a multi<br>
layer structure of the sidewalls of the brewing container or of a separate outer sealing<br>
may comprise an outside polymer film, an intermediate barrier layer comprising a<br>
metal foil and an inside layer of polymer sealant (e.g. HDPE).<br>
Likewise in an embodiment of the invention a preferred combination of materials for<br>
a multi layer structure, which forms the bottom material of the brewing container or<br>
of a separate outer sealing may comprise a similar multi layer structure, wherein the<br>
intermediate metal foil barrier layer is substituted for a barrier layer comprising a<br>
polymer film being metallized and coated with e.g. EvOH (ethylene vinyl alcohol).<br>
In an embodiment of the invention differences in flexibility of the sidewall material<br>
and bottom material of the brewing container are manipulated by substitutions, e.g.<br>
as described above, where the substitution of metal foil with a metallized film coated<br>
with EvOH may facilitate a more flexible multi layer material.<br><br>
In an embodiment of the invention said aroma material comprises roast and/or<br>
ground coffee, instant coffee, tea, milk powder, herb, fruit, meat, chocolate powder,<br>
vegetables, grains or any combination thereof or any other materials which<br>
comprises or provides flavor or aroma or other functionalities.<br>
Other functionalities than flavor or aroma may for example be color, consistency,<br>
energy etc,<br>
The beverages made by the brewing device may for example be coffee, espresso,<br>
latte, mocha, tea, iced drinks, hot chocolate, blended drinks, fruit juices or any other<br>
edible or drinkable fluids.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention a disposable brewing device is used for brewing<br>
of a beverage.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention the method of brewing a beverage in a disposable<br>
brewing device comprises that the beverage is obtained by adding liquid into said<br>
brewing container under substantially atmospheric pressure.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention the method of brewing coffee in a disposable<br>
brewing device comprises that the coffee is obtained by adding hot water into said<br>
brewing container under substantially atmospheric pressure.<br>
When the brewing device is used for making coffee the brewing process may involve<br>
that coffee grounds are mixed with water, causing an infusion process during which<br>
the coffee grounds and water may interact, which may include that the coffee<br>
grounds absorb water and thereafter fall down while giving off aroma to the water<br>
and thereby bringing about a coffee beverage.<br><br>

For reasons of explanation, parts of the brewing device of fig. 1A and fig. 5 to 18 axe<br>
shown as partly transparent.<br><br>
Fig. 1A and 1B illustrate a front view and a side view, respectively, of a brewing<br>
device 1 in an embodiment of the invention.<br>
The brewing device 1 comprises an outer brewing compartment 3 also referred to as<br>
a brewing container and as an outer bag. Sheet materials 6, a bottom welding 9, two<br>
side weldings also referred to as fusion seals 8 and an upper breakable sealing 18<br>
collectively define the outer brewing compartment. The sheet material 6" furthermore<br>
forms a handle 12 reinforced by a continuous lamination over the complete area of<br>
the handle 12 defining areas. The upper part of the outer bag comprises a top sealing<br>
or closing, e.g. a flap 11 formed by a sheet portion. The top closing 11 is preferably<br>
formed with an adhesive for the purpose of closing the bag when liquid has been<br>
poured or injected into the device 1. Further explanation of the functionality of the<br>
device 1 during use in this respect will be given below. At the top of the brewing<br>
compartment 3 the sheet materials 6 are joined in a peelable sealing 18, and above<br>
the sealing 18 a part of the sheet material 6 forms a clutch-flap 19. A sheet material<br>
10, s^e also the fig. 2-4, forms a lower part of the outer brewing compartment 3 and<br>
the sheet material 10 is laminated to the side welding 8 and is formed by the<br>
continuous lamination 9. The lower arrangement provides a reinforced self-standing<br>
arrangement when the outer compartment 3 has been filled with liquid. The basic<br>
principle of the lower arrangement is well-known within the art.<br>
Furthermore the brewing device comprises an inner compartment 2 defined by a<br>
filter material 4 and welded to the outer compartment 3 defining sheets 6. The inner<br>
compartment comprises an aroma material 5, illustrated in fig, 2-4.<br>
Evidently, the fastening of the inner compartment 2 to the outer compartment 3 may<br>
be performed in several different ways, e.g. by welding, heat lamination, gluing, etc,<br>
and the fastening points may be discrete or continuous, e.g. one or both of the<br>
weldings 8. It should in this context be noted that an inner compartment in principle<br>
may be freely "floating" within the outer compartment although a kind of suspension<br><br>
or fixation of the inner compartment with respect to the outer compartment is<br>
preferred.<br>
The illustrated filter material 4 comprises a polymer film comprising a number of<br>
discrete holes 7 of an appropriate size obtained e.g. by stamping. The sizes of the<br>
holes may be adjusted to the desired filter function with respect to the applied aroma<br>
material 5.<br>
In fig. 2-4, three different cross-sections of the expanded disposable brewing device<br>
of fig. 1A are showed at the lines II-I1, III-III and IV-IV of fig. 1A respectively.<br>
Fig. 2 illustrates a cross-section at the line II-II of the brewing device 1. The<br>
illustrated brewing device basically comprises two compartments as described above,<br>
namely an inner compartment 2 formed by a filter material 4 located within an outer<br>
compartment 3 basically formed by the sheets 6 and 10 by the above described<br>
gathering, e.g. welding. The inner compartment 2 comprises an aroma material 5.<br>
The above-described continuous lamination 9 of the sheet material 10 to the sheets 6<br>
forms a part of a bottom support structure, which may ensure that the brewing device<br>
is self-standing when the outer and inner compartments are filled with liquid.<br>
Fig. 3 illustrates a cross-section at the line III-III of the unfolded brewing device 1 of<br>
fig. 1B and fig. 2 at a cross-section a little closer to the line IV-IV of fig. 1A. It is<br>
noted that the distance between the inside walls at the bottom of the outer<br>
compartment 3 is increased when compared to the cross-section of fig. 2.<br>
Fig. 4 illustrates a cross-section of the line IV-IV of the unfolded brewing device 1 of<br>
fig. 1B, fig. 2 and fig. 3 in the midst of a the brewing device at line IV-IV. It is noted<br>
that the distance between the inside walls at the bottom of the outer compartment 3 is<br>
increased when compared to the cross-section of fig. 3.<br><br>
It is noted that according to an alternative and preferred embodiment of the<br>
invention, the sheets 6 and sheet material 10 may be formed by one single folded<br>
sheet. This sheet may comprise a lower arrangement defining welding corresponding<br>
to the above described sheet 6 and 10 gathering welding 9 and of course the already<br>
described side defining weldings 8.<br>
It is furthermore noted that according to a preferred embodiment of the invention the<br>
the brewing container materials comprising sheet materials 6 and 10 combined with<br>
weldings S and 9 and a peelable sealing 18 in the top collectively form an outer<br>
sealing of the brewing device. This outer sealing may effectively form a barrier for<br>
gasses, moisture, aroma and other matters so that diffusion in and out of the brewing<br>
container is prevented. Thus the aroma material 5 contained in the brewing container<br>
is hereby protected until the top peelable sealing 18 is broken.<br>
Fig. 5-10 illustrates the process of using an aroma material 5 containing brewing<br>
device as described in fig. 1A, 1B and 2-4. According to the illustrated embodiment<br>
the aroma material comprises coffee grounds.<br>
In fig. 5 a brewing device 1 according to fig. 1A is provided.<br>
In fig. 6 the brewing device is initially opened by mechanically stretching to the sides<br>
of the arrows A and B. Hereby the peelable sealing 18 is broken. Clutching and<br>
pulling in the flaps 11 and 19 may perform the stretching to the sides of arrow A.<br>
Evidently, according to a further embodiment of the invention, the initial step of<br>
mechanically stretching to the sides of the arrows B may be omitted as the liquid<br>
may perform the task during filling.<br><br>
In fig. 7 a liquid dispenser 14 such as a kettle pours liquid into the brewing device 1.<br>
The liquid, preferably hot, mixes with the coffee grounds and forms a liquid coffee<br>
suspension 15 within the inner filter compartment 2.<br>
In fig. 8 the top flap 11 is folded in the direction of the arrow A.<br>
In fig.9 the closing of the top flap 11 has been completed and the suspension 15 is<br>
now contained within the outer compartment of the brewing device and maybe partly<br>
within the inner compartment, The closing of the top flap 11 establishes a closed<br>
container having an opening 16, which forms a kind of discharging arrangement or<br>
pour spout. Typically, the brewing device should now rest for e.g. 1-20 minutes and<br>
when brewing e.g. coffee, preferably 2-7 minutes before the brewing is completed.<br>
In fig. 10 the brewing has been completed and a user may now, e.g. by means of the<br>
handle 12 lift the brewing device 1 and pour the brewed liquid 15, here coffee, into a<br>
cup 17 and the drink is ready for intake. Note that the granules of the suspension 15<br>
remains completely or at least substantially in the inner compartment of the brewing<br>
device 1, thereby ensuring that the obtained coffee is free of annoying substances.<br>
Fig. 11 illustrates an alternative embodiment 20 of the invention substantially<br>
corresponding to the illustrated embodiment of fig. 1A, but now with a permanent<br>
upper sealing 21.<br>
In fig. 12, a user simply obtains access to the brewing device by cutting a slip 22 of<br>
the sealed brewing device 1 thereby forming an opening 23.<br>
In fig. 13 liquid, preferably water, has been injected or poured into the brewing<br>
device and the brewed liquid 15 may now be poured into e.g. a cup 17 by means of<br>
the opening 23.<br><br>
Fig. 14-16 illustrate one of several different ways of injecting liquid into the brewing<br>
device of fig. 12. According to this embodiment an accessory device 26 is applied for<br>
the purpose. The accessory liquid containing device 26 comprises a pipe stub 25<br>
adapted for insertion into the opening 23 of the brewing device 20.<br>
In fig. 15 the brewing device 20 is suspended in the pipe stub 25 and in fig. 16 liquid<br>
27 is injected into the brewing device and the brewed liquid may subsequently be<br>
dispensed via the opening 23.<br>
Fig. 17 illustrates an alternative embodiment 30 and one of several different ways of<br>
adjusting the volume of the inner compartment. Here obtained by a welding 31,<br>
which affects the inner compartment material 2 only. The welding 31 may be located<br>
differently according to the preferred volume of the inner compartment. The welding<br>
31 further has the function of preventing the aroma material from being poured out<br>
of the container along with the brewed beverage.<br>
Fig, 18 illustrates an alternative embodiment 40, wherein a brewing device is being<br>
enclosed in a separate outer sealing 41. The outer sealing 41 may be rectangular,<br>
oval, bag-like or box-like etc. The design of the outer sealing 41 is not limiting for<br>
the scope of the invention.<br>
An example of a specific preferred choice of materials for the purpose of making a<br>
brewing device for coffee brewing is stated below.<br>
Sidewalls 6 of the brewing container may be made of a multi-layer laminate material<br>
comprising three layers: An outside layer made of PETP, an intermediate layer as<br>
barrier layer made of aluminium foil, e.g. a 9 um foil and an inside layer forming a<br>
sealant comprising 150 µm high-density polyethylene (HDPE)<br><br>
The bottom sheet 10 of the brewing container may be made of a multi-layer laminate<br>
material comprising three layers: An outside layer made of coextruded biaxially<br>
oriented polypropylene, e.g. of a thickness of 20 µm. An intermediate layer as barrier<br>
layer made of polyethylene terephthalats (PET) metallized and coated with ethylene<br>
vinyl alcohol (EvOH). An inside layer forming a sealant comprising, e.g. a 50 µm<br>
linear-low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) or high-density polyethylene (HDPE).<br>
The inner compartment 4 may be made of 30 urn high-density polyethylene (HDPE)<br>
stamped with holes of 0.2 * 0.4 size and 8 holes per cm2 density.<br>
General comments to the choice of materials will be described below as it is stressed<br>
that the present invention is in no way restricted to the above-described material. One<br>
or several layers may be applicable for both the inner and the outer compartment.<br>
Moreover further compartments may be added both within the described<br>
