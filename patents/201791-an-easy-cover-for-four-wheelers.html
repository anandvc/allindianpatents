AN EASY COVER FOR FOUR WHEELERS<br>
Technical field<br>
This inveniion relates to four wheeler covers. It particularly relates to an easy, heat, dust,<br>
rain proof cover without need for transport, carrying the same for covering the vehicle faster<br>
and easier, with built in pilfer proof features and anti heat shield with cooling in summers.<br>
State of art<br>
Existing car covers are made of thick tarpaulin   or plastic that is difficult to spread,<br>
fold, carry, store and do not protect the vehicle at all times and places! So the vehicle collects<br>
dust, rain water and gets corroded wasting life of vehicle and costly repairs. In summer, our<br>
hot sun, heats the vehicle for unpleasant travel, increasing cooling costs.<br>
Constraints in use of the existing covers are:<br>
1 .Covers cannot be transported to all places and time.<br>
2.It is difficult to apply or fold manually,<br>
3.It does not protect the vehicle at all times, as it is not inbuilt.<br>
4.Covers are hard to clean, but easily pick up dust and dirties if carried inside.<br>
S.Covers are not easily washable, not in attractive colours. 6.There is no protection from sun's heat.<br>
It is the object of the new invention to eliminate these major defects. An extensive search of the market, vehicles, worldwide   was studied. Since the invention is radically different in its fixity, heat shield, easy spread or roll back. Motorized operation, the inventor is unable to reveal any similar, related patent specifications out of databases for easy covering and heat protection.<br>
The invention is directed to a cover that is most effective for all vehicles and users, even for kids or women, to cover the vehicle, saving on corrosion costs.<br><br>
Accordingly, it is the object of the inventor is to invent a cover that is radically different in parts [only sides has fabric and top has firm heat shield], construction and use. Another ohjccl oflhc invcniion is lo invcnl ;i cover Ihat   will be iised lonj^'^er, saving on corrosion costs   with a novel built in anti-heating shield.<br>
Summary<br>
The new cover  comprises of a cover proper that is heat, dust, rain proof, easily washable,<br>
foldable made of natural or treated fabric.    The cover is spread to cover from front to back of the car including its  appendages. The cover is made as a   main tlap that is easily reliable and   fixed to the inside of a box provided with a lock-bearing lid!     The box is fixed to a heat shield fixed to top of the passenger compartment [which prevents heating]. The heat shield with the box is fixed to top of vehicle, forming a   pilfer proof cover with elegance, easy use, good looks and cooling in summer. The cover is spread out of box or folded back to store simply. As it is easy to wash, looks clean longer! The cover will eliminate need for covered parking places too! The fabric covers all sides and has rolling mechanism to cover four sides or rolled back for storing!<br>
Statement of Drawings<br>
The objects and features of the invention will become apparent after perusal of the<br>
following description, taken in conjunction with accompanying diagrams where in:<br>
Fig. I. Shows the easy cover spread on vehicle with the box and shield.<br>
Fig.2. Shows the parts of the cover and the rolling mechanism.<br>
Fig.3. Shows parts of shield, box with lid.<br>
Fig.4. Shows a modification with the box at back.<br><br>
Description of the   preferred embodiment<br>
The following specification   describes  the salient features of the invention, its<br>
construction, use and advantages.<br>
The easy cover   has the cover proper, fixed in a box fixed to top of vehicle. The box has a<br>
lid, with lock, to   safely pull or store the cover. Cover itself is made of washable, heat, dust,<br>
and waterproof material synthetic or natural.<br>
The cover, kept in the box is pulled out, spread all over and fixed by tapes or Velcro to the<br>
body of the car. To store, cover is rolled back, folded compact and locked in the box with out<br>
fear of theft.<br>
It is better as it is easy to handle, fold, store, wash, easily even for kids!<br>
The cover easily protects the vehicle at all times and places! Heat shield fixed to the top<br>
with the box prevents   direct solar heating of the cabin for cool travel even in summer,<br>
decreasing cooling cost of an air-conditioner.<br>
The cover consists of a box I made of metal, or strong plastic to withstand accident impacts. A heat shield 2   forms the roof of this box 1 and is fixed to the lop of the vehicle. A lid 3, with a   lock 4 closes the box. Water holes 5 in the bottom drain off all water.<br>
The box carries a cover 6 made of heat, dust, and waterproof fabric e.g. umbrella   cloth. This cloth can be rolled   to small size. The   cover proper has a middle part 7 to cover all sides, front to back. The flaps 8 covers the accessories say, mirrors. Velcro or tapes 9 at the lower borders, fix and spread fabric securely to   the vehicle even in strong winds. The fabric is suspended by hooks 10, fixed to top edge of the covering fabric. The hooks are fitted to a rope 11, traveling on pulleys 12, fixed to the frame 13 that supports the heat shield and box. The fabric in various colours   is aDocalinti with easv iiood    wa5;hahiHlv. For innper new looks!<br><br>
Advantages<br>
This easy cover provides following advantages.<br>
1.	It is easy to cover, store, or wash.<br>
2.	No worry to carry the cover, as it is now inbuilt.<br>
3.	Strong cooling ami-heat shield is fixed firmly, wiihoul fear of Hying away in travel.<br>
4.	Easy convenience of use, just switch on, to roll or reroll the fabric.<br>
5.	No fear of theft of :over, as it is fixed in side the box or spread and taped.<br>
6.No search of coven d parking places for vehicle parking any time and place.<br>
7.Longer life of vehi :les from lesser corrosion.<br>
