The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of imidazolyl compounds.<br>
1f2,319-Tetrahydro-9-methyl-3-[2-methyl-1H-imidazo[-1-y!)methyi]-4H-carba2ol-4-one (ondansetron) is known from EP191562 and US4,695,578. In these patent publications a general class of compounds including ondansetron and homologous compounds, their preparation and their use as potent selective antagonists at "neuronal" 5-hydroxytryptamine receptors and their use in the treatment of migraine and psychotic disorders is described.<br>
(10R)-5,6,9,10-Tetrahydro-10[(2-methyl-1H-imidazol-1-yl)methyl]-4H-pyrido[3,2,1-jk]-<br>
carbazol-11 (8H)-one (ciiansetron) (also known as (R)-(-)-4,5,6,8,9,10-hexahydro-10-[(2-methyi-1H-imidazoH-y!)methyl]-11H-pyrido-[3)2I1-jk]-carbazol-11-one) is known from EP-B-0297651, from EP-B-0601345 and from EP-B-768309. in the first patent publication a general class of compounds, including ciiansetron and homologous compounds, their preparation and their use as 5-HT antagonists is described. The second patent publication describes the use of a selection of these type of compounds for the treatment of certain diseases and the third the preparation of enantiomerically pure compounds and their hydrochloride monohydrate.<br>
It is a common feature of the above compounds that they contain a substituted imidazolyl group attached to the a-place with regard to the keto group of the carbazoie system with a methylene bridge. Several possibilities for the synthesis of these compounds are described in the mentioned patent publications, it is a common feature in these syntheses that the substituted imidazolyl group is introduced by means of a Mannich reaction, followed by a deamination to yield an intermediate exomethylene compound which is reacted with the substituted imidazolyl group (see scheme 1 for an example).<br>
A drawback of this route is that the yield in this sequence of reaction steps is rather low. In US 4,695,578 the first step which is normally giving the lowest yield is not described and the second step (Example 7 of US 4,695,578) gives a yield of 68%. In EP-B-0297651 the first step (Example 1c of EP-B-0297651) has a yield of 53% and the second step (Example 1d of EP-B-0297651) a yield of 87%. During scale-up it<br><br>
appeared that this route gives rise to the formation of a considerable amount of tar-like side-products.<br><br>
Scheme 1.<br>
It is the objective of the present invention to provide an alternative process to prepare imidazolyl-compounds which process should be economically operative and meet one or more of the following requirements: a) a relatively high yield, b) short reaction times compared with prior art processes, c) less side reactions, d) higher quality of the final product and e) using non-diluted reaction conditions and an environmentally acceptable solvent.<br>
It has surprisingly been found that these type of imidazolyi compounds can easily be prepared using a substituted oxazoiidine compound for the introduction of the methylene bridge.<br>
Therefore the present invention relates to a method for the preparation of an imidazolyi compound of the general formula<br><br><br>
(I)<br>
wherein:<br>
Ra and  Rb each separately are (CrCe)alkyl, (CrC6) alkoxyalkyi, optionally<br>
substituted aryl or heteroaryl;<br>
or wherein Ra and Rb together form a further homocyclic or heterocyclic system<br>
comprising one or more rings;<br>
R3' and Rb
said carbon-carbon double bond optionally being part of an aromatic system;<br>
Rc is hydrogen, (C1-C6)alkyl, (CrC6)alkoxy, (C1-C6)alkoxyalkyl or halogen;<br>
Rd is hydrogen or (c1-C4)alkyl;<br>
Re is hydrogen or (c1-C4alkyl;<br>
m is 1 or 2; and<br>
R-, is hydrogen or (c1-C4)alkyl; as well as its acid addition salt; characterized in that a compound of the general formula<br>
(II)<br>
  (III)<br><br>
wherein:<br>
R is a hydrogen, a (C1-C4)atkyi group optionally substituted with a hydroxygroup or an optionally substituted aryl group,<br>
R\ R", R"' and R,m each individually are a hydrogen or a {CrC4)alkyl group; followed by a reaction with a compound of the formula<br>
  (IV)<br>
wherein R1f Rd and Re have the meanings defined above; and optionally followed by a reaction with a suitable acid.<br>
Alkyl groups of the present invention include straight-chained, branched and cyclic afkyl radicals containing up to 6 carbon atoms. Suitable alkyl groups may be saturated or unsaturated. Further, an alkyl group may also be substituted one or more times with substituents selected from the group consition of aryl, halo, hydroxy, cyano or one- or dl-aikyi substituted amino.<br>
Aryl groups of the present invention include aryl radicals which may contain up to 6 hetero atoms. An aryl group may also be optionally substituted one or more times with an substituent selected from the group consistion of aryl, (CrC6) alkyl, halo, hydroxy, cyano or one- or di-alkyl substituted amino, and it may be aiso fused with an aryl group or cycioaikyl rings. Suitable aryl groups include, e.g. phenyl, naphtyl, tolyl, imidazolyl," pyridyi, pyrroyl, thienyl, pyrimidyl. thiazoly! and fury! groups.<br>
With a homocyclic system is meant a system containing at least one saturated or unsaturated cyclic group containing only carbon atoms and hydrogen atoms. With a heterocyclic system is meant a system containing at least one saturated or unsaturated cyclic group containing also one or more heteroatoms such as N, O or S. Both the homocyclic and heterocyclic system may optionally be substituted with a substituent selected from the group consisting of alkyl, aryl , cyano, halogen, hydroxy or one- or di-alkyl substituted amino.<br>
in a preferred embodiment of the invention Rc is hydrogen or (C-rC6)alkylf Rd is hydrogen or (C1-C4)alkyl; Rs is hydrogen or (CrC4)alkyi; and R1 is hydrogen, methyl or ethyl.<br><br>
The reaction according to the invention is especially useful for the preparation of compounds of the general formla<br>
Ri<br>
o	V<br>
L^NA^<ch2></ch2>
R6	R5<br>
Ri<br>
o	V<br>
'I<br>
R6	R5<br>
(ia) wherein:<br>
m is 1 or 2;<br>
R1 is hydrogen, methyl or ethyl; and<br>
R5 is a (CrC4) alkyl;<br>
R5 is a hydrogen or a (CrC4)aikyl, or<br>
R5 and R5 together with the intermediate atoms form a 5, 6T or 7 membered<br>
ring, optionally substituted with one or two substituents selected from the group<br>
consisting   of   halogen,   hydroxy,   (C1-C4)alkyl,   (C1-C4)aikoxya!ky!   and   (Ci-<br>
C4)alkoxy.<br>
in this case the starting compound is a compound of the general formula<br>
  (lla) This compound is further referred to as a carbazolone compound.<br>
Preferred compounds of the general formula ia are the compound wherein m=1 and R5 and R6 together with the intermediate atoms form a 6-membered ring and the compound wherein m=1, R5 is methyl and R6 is hydrogen. For the first compound the yield for the process starting with 5,6,9,104etrahydro-4H-pyrido[3,2l1-jk]carbazo!-11(8H)-one and 3-oxazolidineethanol is 77% (see Example 2) compared with the overall yield of 46% in the process according to EP0297651 (Examples Ic and id). Higher yields may be obtained at a production scale.<br><br>
in the substituted oxazolidine preferably one of the R' and R" and one of the R1" and R"" is hydrogen, as an oxazolidine disubstituted on the same carbon atom, such as 4,4-dimethyloxazolidine gives a lower yield in the reaction. Preferred oxazolidines are 3-oxazoiidineethanoi and 3-ethyl-oxazoiidine. The most preferred oxazolidine is 3-oxazolidineethanol.<br>
The reaction is carried out in acidic medium, and the grade of acidity depends on the activation of the system that has to react. In the case of carbazolone systems the medium should be highly acidic. Examples of suitable acids in the last case are methanesulfonic acid, trifluoromethanesulfonic acid, p-toluenesuifonic acid and HCi gas in alcoholic medium.<br>
in order to get a high yield, the reaction solution should contain only a low amount of water. The amount of water should preferably be below 0.6% (V/V), more preferably below 0.3 % V/V and most preferably beiow 0.1% V/V.<br>
The optimal reaction temperature is dependent on the starting material and the solvent and differs for the two reaction steps. The first step of the reaction can be performed between 40°C and 110°C. For the carbazolone systems the preferred reaction temperature in the first step is between 50°C and 90°C and the most preferred temperature is approximately 70°C. The second step can generally be performed between 100°C and 140°C. For the carbazolone systems the preferred reaction temperature in the second step is between 110°C and 130°C and the most preferred temperature is approximately 120°C.<br>
The reaction can be performed In different solvents such as dipolar aprotic solvents like DMF or in alcohols. Preferred solvents are c4-c7 alcohols and the choice may depend on the desired reaction temperature. Examples of suitable alcohols are 1-butanol, 1-hexano) and isoamyl alcohol, A preferred alcohol is 1-butanol, Also suitable are mixtures of aromatic hydrocarbons and alcohols, such as mixtures of toluene and an alcohol and monochiorobenzene and an alcohol. A preferred mixture is a mixture of monochlorobenzene and methanol. When solvent mixtures are used the lower boiling solvent can be distilled off before the second step in ofder to reach higher reflux temperatures of the solvent system in the second step.<br><br>
The ratio of the solvent volume to the amount of reactants in the mixture can be varied over a relatively broad range and depends on the solubility of the reactants. In general the ratio of the amount of solvent to the amount of reactants can typically be about 1 : 1 to 15:1, where the ratio is expressed as the volume of solvent relative to the weight of the reactants in the solvent (in mi/g). Preferably the ratio is about 1:1 to about 10:1. in the case of the carbazoione systems the preferred ratio of the volume of solvent to the weight of reactants is about 4:1.<br>
The products obtained can be crystallized from different solvents. Examples of solvents for the cyrstallisation of free bases are aromatic hydrocarbons such as toluene. The hydrochloric acid salts can e.g. be crystallized from alcoholic solvents, such as isopropanol or 1-butanol.<br>
The following examples are only intended to further illustrate the invention, in more detail, and therefore these examples are not deemed to restrict the scope of the invention in any way.<br>
