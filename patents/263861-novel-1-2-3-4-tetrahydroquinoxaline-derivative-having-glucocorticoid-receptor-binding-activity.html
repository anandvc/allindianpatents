NOVEL 1,2,3,4-TETRAHYDROQUINOXALINE DERIVATIVE HAVING<br>
GLUCOCORTICOID RECEPTOR BINDING ACTIVITY<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a novel<br>
1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoxaline derivative or a salt<br>
thereof, which is useful as a pharmaceutical. The<br>
derivative has a glucocorticoid receptor binding<br>
activity and is useful as a glucocorticoid receptor<br>
modulator having a nonsteroidal structure (a<br>
glucocorticoid receptor agonist and/or a<br>
glucocorticoid receptor antagonist).<br>
Background Art<br>
A glucocorticoid receptor is a 94 kDa ligand-<br>
activated intracellular transcriptional factor that<br>
is a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily. This<br>
receptor is a mediator of glucocorticoid action which<br>
effects the metabolism of carbohydrates, proteins,<br>
fats and the like, the suppression of the immune or<br>
inflammatory responses, the activatation of the<br>
central nervous system, the regulation of the<br>
cardiovascular function and the basal and stress-<br>
related homeostasis and the like.<br>
As glucocorticoid action-related diseases, metabolic<br>
disorders such as diabetes and obesity, inflammatory<br>
diseases such as arthritis, enteritis and chronic<br><br>
obstructive pulmonary diseases, autoimmune diseases<br>
such as connective tissue diseases, allergic diseases<br>
such as asthma, atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinitis<br>
and conjunctivitis, central nervous system diseases<br>
such as psychiatric disorders, Alzheimer's disease<br>
and drug use disorders, cardiovascular diseases such<br>
as hypertension, hypercalcemia, hyperinsulinemia and<br>
hyperlipidemia, homeostasis-related diseases causing<br>
an abnormality of neuro-immune-endocrine balance,<br>
glaucoma and the like are known. (SOUGOU RINSYOU,<br>
54(7), 1951-2076 (2005), JP-A-2002-193955.)<br>
Therefore, a compound having a glucocorticoid<br>
receptor binding activity is considered to be useful<br>
as a preventive and/or therapeutic agent for these<br>
diseases.<br>
As such a compound having a glucocorticoid<br>
receptor binding activity, glucocorticoid receptor<br>
agonists synthesized in the living body such as<br>
cortisol and corticosterone, synthetic glucocorticoid<br>
receptor agonists such as dexamethasone, prednisone<br>
and prednisilone, non-selective glucocorticoid<br>
receptor antagonists such as RU486 and the like are<br>
known. (JP-A-2002-193955)<br>
On the other hand, compounds having a 1,2,3,4-<br>
tetrahydroquinoxaline structure are disclosed in WO<br>
04/099192 and JP-A-5-148243 and the like. The<br>
compounds disclosed in WO 04/099192 are protein<br>
thyrosine phosphatase inhibitors essentially having a<br>
carboxylic group. On the other hand, a large number<br><br>
of compounds having 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoxaline<br>
structure are disclosed as anti-virus agents in JP-A-<br>
5-148243. However, the present compound has not been<br>
specifically disclosed in any of patents.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
Problems to be solved<br>

synthesis of a novel 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoxaline<br>
derivative and to find a pharmacological action of<br>
the derivative.<br>
Means of Solving Problems<br>

compounds. Further, the present inventors studied the<br>
pharmacological actions of the derivatives and as a<br>
result, they found that the derivatives have a<br>
glucocorticoid receptor binding activity and are<br>
useful as a pharmaceutical, and thus the present<br>
invention has been completed.<br>
That is, the present invention relates to a<br>
compound represented by the following general formula<br>
(1) or a salt thereof (hereinafter referred to as<br>
"the present compound") and a pharmaceutical<br>
composition containing the same. Further, a preferred<br>
invention in its pharmaceutical use relates to a<br><br>
glucocorticoid receptor modulator, and its target<br>

diseases, that is, metabolic disorders such as<br>
diabetes and obesity, inflammatory diseases such as<br>
arthritis, enteritis and chronic obstructive<br>
pulmonary diseases, autoimmune diseases such as<br>
connective tissue diseases, allergic diseases such as<br>
asthma, atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinitis and<br>

drug use disorders, cardiovascular diseases such as<br>
hypertension, hypercalcemia, hyperinsulinemia and<br>
hyperlipidemia, homeostasis-related diseases causing<br>
an abnormality of neuro-immune-endocrine balance,<br>

[Pharmacological Test]<br>
1. Evaluation Test for Binding Activity to<br>
Glucocorticoid Receptor (hereinafter referred to as<br>
"GR")<br>
In order to evaluate a binding activity to GR, a<br>
receptor competitor assay was carried out by a<br>
fluorescence polarization method. In the assay, a GR<br>
competitor assay kit (manufactured by Invitrogen, cat<br>
No. P2816) was used, and a procedure was carried out<br>
according to the protocol attached to the kit.<br>
Hereinafter, the specific method will be described.<br>
(Preparation of Reagents)<br>
GR screening buffer: A buffer containing 10 mM<br>
potassium phosphate (pH 7.4), 20 mM sodium molybdate<br>
(Na2MoO4), 0.1 mM ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid<br>
(EDTA), 5 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 0.1 mM stabilizing<br>
peptide and 2% dimethylsulfoxide was prepared.<br>
4 x GS1 solution: Fluormone™ GS1, which is a<br>
fluorescent glucocorticoid ligand, was diluted with<br>
GR screening buffer, whereby a 4 nM solution was<br>
prepared.<br><br>
4 x GR solution: Recombinant human GR was<br>
diluted with GR screening buffer, whereby a 16 nM<br>
solution was prepared.<br>
(Preparation of Test Compound Solution)<br>
After a test compound was dissolved in<br>
dimethylsulfoxide, the resulting solution was diluted<br>
with GR screening buffer, whereby a 20 μM test<br>
compound solution was prepared.<br>
(Test Method and Measurement Method)<br>
1)	The test compound solution was added in an<br>
amount of 25 μL into each well of a 96-well plate,<br>
and then, 4 x GSl solution and 4 x GR solution were<br>
added in an amount of 12.5 μL into each well,<br>
respectively.<br>
2)	The plate was incubated in a dark place at<br>
room temperature for 2 to 4 hours.<br>
3)	By using a multimode plate reader, Analyst™<br>
HT (manufactured by LJL Biosystems), fluorescence<br>
polarization of each well was measured. As the blank,<br>
a well containing GR screening buffer in place of the<br>
test compound and 4 x GSl solution was used.<br>
4)	The same procedure as that in the above 1) to<br>
3) was carried out except that GR screening buffer<br>
was used in place of the test compound solution, and<br>
the obtained result was taken as the negative<br>
control.<br>
5)	The same procedure as that in the above 1) to<br>
3) was carried out except that 2 mM dexamethasone was<br>
used in place of the test compound solution, and the<br><br>
obtained result was taken as the positive control.<br>
(Calculation Equation of GR Binding Ratio)<br>
A GR binding ratio (%) was calculated from the<br>
following equation.<br>
GR binding ratio (%) = 100 x [1 - (fluorescence<br>
polarization of test compound solution - fluorescence<br>
polarization of positive control solution) /<br>
(fluorescence polarization of negative control<br>
solution - fluorescence polarization of positive<br>
control solution)]<br>
