Azaindole-indole coupled derivatives, preparation methods and uses thereof<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a novel class of azaindole-indole coupled derivatives. The common<br>
structural feature of these derivatives is that they are coupled by azaindole and indole molecules at in different<br>
positions, forming extended pi conjugated heterocyclic systems. These derivatives inhibit cell growth and<br>
proliferation through various mechanisms. The invention also relates to the preparation methods of such<br>
derivatives, pharmaceutical compositions comprising the same and the uses thereof.<br>
Background<br>
The present invention is the continuation application of "A specific indoles compounds and preparation<br>
methods thereof (Application Number: 02138518.1; granted on May 4, 2005), "A pharmaceutical emulsion<br>
suitable for undissolved medicaments and preparation methods thereof (Application Number:<br>
200410052816.5; Application date: July 14, 2007), "Preparation methods of N(l)-hydrocarbyl-3'-oximido<br>
indirubin derivatives (I) and medical uses thereof (Application Number: 200510094482.2; granted on: August<br>
1, 2007) and "A dispersing agent suitable for undissolved medicaments" (Application Number:<br>
200610038112.1; Application date: January 17, 2006).<br>
Monomelic compounds from plants are the major class among anti-tumor drugs. For instance,<br>
camptothecin isolated from Camptothera acuminate and paclitaxel obtained from Cephalotaxus are the<br>
well-known examples.<br>
Through researching traditional medicinal plants with modern pharmaceutical memods, it is found mat<br>
indirubin (1, indirubin, 2',3-bisindole, purple), a bisindole derivative contained in Qingdai, is effective in the<br>
treatment of chronic myelocytic leukemia (CML). It has advantages of quick onset, low dose, little side effects,<br>
and low cost, etc. Subsequendy, extensive structural modifications and biological activity studies on bisindole<br>
compounds obtained from Qingdai [including indigo (2), 2, 2'-bisindole, blue; isoindigo (3), 3, 3'-bisindole,<br>
brown] were carried out. As a result, N-1-methylisoindigo was found to have better efficacy and lower toxicity<br>
than indirubin.<br><br>
Further studies demonstrate mat the pharmacodynamic mechanism of indirubin and derivatives thereof<br>
inhibit tumor proliferation by inhibiting cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs)<br>
The cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) are typical serine (Ser) / threonine (Thr) kinases and signaling<br>
molecules of cell growth. CDKs mainly act on different phases of the cell cycle (a cell cycle is classified into<br>
four phases: G1, S, G2 and M), and allow for cell growth, proliferation (DNA replication and chromosome<br>
segregation), dormancy (cells are out of cell cycle and enter the quiescent period of cell division, known as the<br>
G0 phase) or apoptosis. CDKs can also regulate nerve and thymus function. Unlike other kinases, a hybrid<br>
dimer complex formed with the corresponding cyclins is necessary for the catalytic functions of CDKs. At<br>
least 9 CDKs (CDK1~9) and 11 cyclins (A~J) have been identified in human cells. Different CDKs bind to<br>
different cyclins or cyclin subunits. For instance, CDK1 (cdc2) binds to cyclin A and B1-B3; CDK2 binds to<br>
cyclin A, D1-D3 and E; CDK4, CDK5 and CDK6 bind to cyclin D1-D3; CDK5 also binds to pk35; CDK7 binds<br>
to cyclin H; and CDK6 binds to cyclin K which is D-related.<br><br>
According to biomedicine research that have won 2001 Nobel Prize, "the relationship between<br>
proliferation and cancer", all kinds of abnormality of CDKs are present in almost all tumor cells " , and cancer<br>
cells enter S, G2 and M phases in cycles and immortalize. For example, over 85% of breast cancer patients<br>
demonstrate abnormality in cyclinE/CDK4/6 . Multiple tumors can be treated by inhibiting CDKs to<br>
effectively preventing cell proliferation (but not killing cells), thus, either promoting cell differentiation, or<br>
promoting cell apoptosis. It is believed that CDK inhibitors are a new class of anticancer drugs with broad<br>
spectrum. In addition, these drugs will have strong selectivity, good efficacy and low toxicity due to their<br>
cytostatic, not cytotoxic activity.<br>
It is shown that CDK inhibitors effectively inhibit growth of various cancer cells, such as cancer of breast,<br>
colon, prostate, and brain tumor, etc. These compounds can also effectively inhibit clinically refractory<br>
androgen-independent prostate cancer cells (PC-3, DU-145), hormones and many other chemotherapy-resistant<br>
advanced metastatic prostate cancer cells due to their ability to inhibit cell proliferation, which is more<br>
significandy. As a result, it has become a new reasonable strategy to develop anticancer drugs by looking for<br>
CDK inhibitors [4-6).<br>
So far, nearly 10 types of small molecule CDK inhibitors and/or regulating agents have been studied,<br>
which are mainly ATP-regional oriented CDK inhibitors . Indirubin and N-1-methylisoindigo, which have<br>
been used clinically are one type of CDK inhibitors. In addition, UCN-01 and flavopiridol, which was<br>
developed by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) of United States, have entered clinical trails ['01.<br><br>
In summary, indirubin bisindole derivatives are important CDK inhibitors that have little toxic<br>
side-effects. However, clinical applications of these compounds are influenced by their poor water-solubility<br>
and liposolubility. In recent years, extensive structural modifications for indirubin derivatives have been<br>
made by many foreign pharmaceutical research institutions and pharmaceutical companies. However, the<br>
anti-tumor effects of indirubin bisindole derivatives are still dissatisfactory.<br>
In a word, there's an urgent need to develop new CDK inhibitors with excellent performance.<br>

For understanding the present invention, the inventors provide the following contents to describe the<br>
mechanism of the compounds according to the invention. However, it should be appreciated that the protection<br>
scope of the invention is not restricted by the mechanism as described.<br>
In the present invention, azaindirubin derivatives are essentially the product from an azaindole molecule<br>
and an indole molecule coupled in the 3, 2'-position; while azaisoindigo derivatives are essentially the product<br>
from an azaindole molecule and an indole molecule coupled in the 3, 3'-position. A carbon atom within indole<br>
ring is replaced by a nitrogen atom, thereby obtaining the following four isomers:<br><br>
Purines (see the following figure) are one of ten CDK inhibitors, the chemical structure of which are<br>
currently known and which are the earliest studied CDK inhibitors[7]. With respect to the structure, azaindole<br>
and purines are very have many similar aspects, both of which are five-membered heterocycle fused to<br>
six-membered aromatic heterocycle.<br><br>
The results of the invention demonstrate that the compounds have similar activity as CDK inhibitors.<br>
Non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (type 2 diabetes mellirus) is one of the major diseases<br>
endangering human health and leading to death. The pathogenesis is insulin resistance. It has been<br>
demonstrated that indirubin derivatives have effect on the activity of PI3K (phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase) in<br>
the insulin signal transduction pathway. They can activate Akt (protein kinase) and inhibit mTOR (mammalian<br>
target of rapamycin), thus sensitizing the peripheral tissues to insulin, and reducing the insulin resistance.<br>
Therefore, the derivatives of the invention can treat tumors, psoriasis, viral skin diseases, acquired<br>
immunodeficiency syndrome, nervous system diseases (such as neurodegenerative disorder and nervous<br><br>
disorder), and type 2 diabetes mellitus, etc.<br>

Said composition can be used to inhibit the activity of CDKs, induce CDKIs, and recover insulin signal<br>
transformation. The compositions of the invention may be pharmaceutical compositions (containing<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable carriers), health care products (containing acceptable carriers for health care<br>
products), foods (containing bromatologically acceptable carriers) or cosmetic products (containing<br>
cosmetically acceptable carriers).<br>
Preferably, compositions of the invention are pharmaceutical compositions, comprising the compounds of<br>
the invention (or the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof) as well as various pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
carriers or excipients.<br>

and it may be any clinically acceptable formulation. The dosage form of pharmaceutical compositions<br>

2. Methods<br>
(i) Cell culture<br>
DU145 cells were inoculated in RPMI1640 medium containing 10% calf serum, incubated at 37 °C, 5%<br>
CO2 in CO2 incubator, and passaged every 2-3 days. In this experiment, cells were grown in logarithmic<br>
growth phase.<br>
(ii) Grouping<br>
In the experiment, the cells at logarithmic growth phase were formulated into suspension, and the<br>
viability by trypan blue staining was more than 98%. The suspension was divided into several groups: 1 as<br>
blank control group (cell suspension); and 2 as experimental groups (cell suspension plus drugs).<br>
(iii) Determination of IC50 values by MTT (the 50% inhibitory concentration)<br>
The drugs were formulated into a stock solution in DMSO, and the concentration of the stock solution<br>
was 20 mmol (used within 4 hours). In the experiment, the work solution of the drugs was diluted with<br>
RPMI1640 medium containing 10% calf serum under aseptic condition, to a final concentration of 80 µM.<br>
The drug concentrations were increased by 2 times (1.25-20 µM).<br>
The DU145 cell in logarithmic growth phase were selected, centrifuged, counted, and formulated into a<br>
cell suspension (2.5 x 10 /ml) with RPMI1640 medium containing 10% calf serum. The cell suspension were<br>
inoculated into 96-well plates at a density of 5000 cells /200 µl per well, incubated for 24 hours at 37 °C, 5%<br>
CO2. According to the above concentration of the drug, the cells were inoculated to 6 groups (including one<br>
control group), with 8 wells per group. After incubating for 72 hours, the viability of cells was measured by<br>
MTT assay. The absorbance value (A) was measured with detection wavelength at 540 nm, reference<br>
wavelength at 630 nm. The inhibitory rate (I) was calculated by the following equation, where T was the<br>
absorbance value of the experimental groups, and C was the absorbance value of the blank control group:<br>
I = (1-T/C) x 100%<br>
The regression equation was calculated by the concentration-inhibitory rate curve, to obtain 50% and 90%<br>
inhibition concentration (IC50 and IC90, µM). The results are shown in Table 5, Table 6 and Figure 2.<br>

3. Discussion<br>
(i) From the MTT assay, it is readily found that most of 5- or 7-azaindirubin derivatives and 5- or<br>
7-azaisoindigo derivatives have strong antitumor activity, and the growth inhibitory effects on tumor cells of<br>
them are much stronger than that of al1-trans retinoic acid, a differentiation inducer. More importandy, most of<br>
5- or 7-azaindirubin derivatives and 5- or 7-azaisoindigo derivatives have good inhibitory effects on<br>
androgen-independent human prostate cancer cells DU145 which are clinically refractory;<br>
(ii) The IC50 of many 5- or 7-azaindirubin derivatives and 5- or 7-azaisoindigo derivatives are similar to<br><br>
or less than that of the reference substances (90 and 91). Compound 91 is a known CDKs inhibitor'(13). The<br>
structures of 38, 129 are quite similar to that of 91, and the difference between them merely involves the atom<br>
at 5 or 7-position. It is also suggested that the newly synthesized compounds of the present invention may have<br>
similar mechanisms on inhibiting tumor cells growth;<br>
(iii) 3'-oximated and 5'-halogenated 5- or 7-azaindirubin derivatives demonstrate relatively significant<br>
growth inhibitory effects on tumor cells, particularly compounds 25, 30, 116, 121 and 124, and compounds<br>
30,121 and 124 still have good safety profile.<br>

1.	Tumor cells: human hepatoma cell lines 7701 QGY and HepG-2, human lung adenocarcinoma cell line<br>
A549, human chronic myelocytic leukemia cell line K562, human leukemia cell line CEM and mouse<br>
melanoma cell line KIII.<br>
2.	Using the methods described in example 2, the biological activity of a portion of newly synthesized 5-<br>
or 7-azaindirubin derivatives and 5- or 7-azaisoindigo derivatives (20 compounds) for inhibiting various tumor<br>
cells growth were determined. The 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50, uM) are shown in Table 7.<br>
Table 7 IC50 (uM) of 5- or 7-azaindirubin and 5- or 7-azaisoindigo derivatives for inhibiting various tumor<br><br>
The results indicate that 5- or 7-azaindirubin derivatives and 5- or 7-azaisoindigo derivatives have the<br>
biological activity of inhibiting various tumor cells growth.<br>
Example 4 Inhibitory effects on CDKs<br>
Reagents: The tested compounds were the same as example 2. Unless otherwise indicated, other chemical<br>
reagents were purchased from Sigma Chemical Company (USA). Polyacrylamide gel used in protein<br>
electrophoresis, SDS, electrophoresis buffer, transfer buffer protein, nitrocellulose membrane were purchased<br>
from American Bio-Rad Life Science Company. Western blotting detection kits and films were purchased from<br><br>
American GE Company. Phospho-ODK2Thr 160 antibody, endogenous cyclin-dependent inhibitor p27 antibody,<br>
CyclinDl and p-Actin antibody were purchased from American Cell Signaling Inc., DAKO and Santa Cruz<br>
Biochemical Technology Company.<br>
Tumor cells and methods for cell culture were the same as example 2.<br>
Phospho-Cdc2, p27, and Cyclin D1 were detected by Western blot: The human prostate cancer cell lines<br>
DU145 at logarithmic growth phase were treated with compounds No.124 and No.126 (concentration is<br>
shown in Figure 3) for 24 hours. The cells were harvested and washed. Total cellular proteins were extracted<br>
and quantified as described previously(14). 50 ug of protein was separated on a SDS-PAGE, electro-transferred<br>
to nitrocellulose filters. Western blot were performed using specific antibothes against Phospho-CDK2,<br>
endogenous cyclin-dependent inhibitor p27 and CyclinDl, with P-Actin antibody as an internal standard. The<br>
result was recorded by ECL films.<br>
Results and discussion:<br>
It is reported that indirubin derivatives can inhibit CDKs of cancer cells. Example 2 and example 3 have<br>
demonstrated that 5- or 7-azaindirubin derivatives and 5- or 7-azaisoindigo derivatives of the invention have<br>
relatively strong growth inhibitory effects on tumor cells. In order to further elucidate whether these<br>
compounds inhibit cell growth by regulating the activity of cyclin-dependent kinases, the effects of the<br>
representative compounds in the present invention, No. 124 and No. 126, on the activity of Cdc2 and p27 and<br>
the protein expression of cyclin Dl were investigated by Western blot, using specific antibothes against Cdc2<br>
phosphorylation protein and the antibothes against other important proteins which regulate the cell cycle, such<br>
as p27 and cyclin Dl. As shown in Figure 3, after treated with compound 124 and 126 for 24 hours, the level<br>
of CDK2 activity (phosphorylation) in human prostate cancer cell lines DU145 decreased in a dose-dependent<br>
manner. At the same time, the protein expression of cyclin Dl was significantly decreased. In contrast, under<br>
the same experimental conditions, the expression of endogenous cyclin-dependent inhibitor p27 was<br>
significantly increased. The changes of the signal proteins inhibited the cell growth. The induction of 5- or<br>
7-azaindirubin derivatives and 5- or 7-azaisoindigo derivatives on the expression of p27 may result from the<br>
activation of AhR-receptor pathway [l5]<br>

Example 6 Investigation on the dissolution of a portion of solid dispersion preparations<br>
Instruments: RCZ-5A capacity medicament dissolve and infiltrate apparatus is made by Tianjin<br>
University Precision Instruments Factory. UV1900 UV-Vis spectrophotometer is made by Shanghai Yayan<br>
Electronic Science And Technology Co., Ltd.<br>
Dissolution determination methods: According to the third method of XC dissolution assay stated in the<br>
appendix of Chinese Pharmacopeia (Edition 2005), the rotation speed was 100 r/min, the temperature was<br>
37+0.5 °C, and the dissolution medium was 100 ml of 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate solution degassed<br>
ultrasonically. A specimen was withdrawn at 45 minute and immediately filtered through a 0.8 µm water<br>
membrane. The filtrate was quantitatively diluted. The absorbance was measured by UV1900, and the<br>
dissolution percentage was calculated.<br>
Results and discussion:<br>
The dissolution rates of a portion of solid dispersions in the above examples were investigated. The<br>
results are shown in table 8.<br>
i 	i	1<br>
As shown in the above table, the solid dispersion preparations, which are made from the compounds of<br>
the present invention, overcomes the shortcomings of these compounds, such as poor hydrophilicity and being<br>
difficult to make into appropriate preparations. Since the dissolution of the compound has been significandy<br>
improved, the preparations with practical values could be achieved. The solubilization effect of the solid<br>
dispersion preparations using combined carriers is better than that of the solid dispersion preparations using<br>
single carrier, because of synergistic effects of more than one carriers. The dissolution of the corresponding<br>
dispersion is much better.<br>

Example 8 Solubility assay<br>
The structure of compound 129 is quite similar to that of compound 91. The difference between them<br>
merely involves me atom at 7-position (shown as the following figure). The solubility assay using them can<br>
indicate the change of solubility of 7-azaindirubin relative to indirubin.<br><br><br>
Testing methods: 5 mg of the compound no. 129 and 91 were respectively added into 2 ml solvent at<br>
room temperature (20 °C), and stirred to dissolve. The results are shown in table 9.<br><br>
As shown in the above table, the water solubility of 7-azaindirubin derivatives (129) is increased, while<br>
the lipid solubility is decreased. Generally, the water solubility and lipid solubility of indirubin are not good.<br>
The lipid solubility of modified indirubin derivatives is increased while the water solubility is decreased, as<br>
demonstrated by compound no. 91. The changes in solubility reflect the necessity of stuthes on 7-azaindirubin<br>
derivatives, and will facilitate the absorption of medicine in vivo and the selection of dosage form, etc .<br>
