				<td>"Cooking hob from tempered glass or other thermodegradoble<br>
materials"<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The presenl invention relates to the use of a domestic gas burner, of<br>
the type comprising a burner base and a burner head provided with<br>
at least one flame crown, in a cooking hob having a supporting<br>
surface made of a materia! that is physically and/or only structurally<br>
degradable in the presence of heat sources, such as, for example,<br>
tempered glass.<br>
By the term "cooking hob" is meant, in what follows, any installation for<br>
the cooking of foodstuff provided with a support for housing at least<br>
one burner designed for supplying heat to the foodstuff itself,<br>
comprising in this term installations such as, for example, surfaces<br>
equipped for cooking or cooking ranges.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Amongst cooking hobs for domestic use, it forms part of the known art<br>
to use, for reasons that are prevalently aesthetic and/or regard<br>
practicality of maintenance, surfaces for housing (or supporting) one<br>
or more atmospheric gas burners, which are made of materials whose<br>
use is not suitable in the presence of high heat emissions, such as, for<br>
example, tempered glass, enamelled steel or stainless steel. Such<br>
materials, in fact, undergo a considerable degradation of their<br>
physical characteristics, and, in particular, their structural<br>
characteristics, when they are in the proximity of heat sources with<br>
high temperatures.<br>
In particular, the use of supporting surfaces made of tempered glass, a<br>
material which, in its most typical compositions, poorly withstands<br>
temperatures higher than 280Â°C, is in any case more desirable in so far<br>
as tempered glass is able, from the aesthetic standpoint as well as the<br><br>
maintenance standpoint, to replace pyroceram, the use of which in<br>
cooking hobs entails extremely high costs.<br>
The use of cooking hobs having a supporting surface made of<br>
pyroceram is, in fact, particularly widespread on account of its<br>
aesthetic qualities and the simple cleaning operations that such<br>
cooking hobs require. In spite of the britfleness of pyroceram, which<br>
implies the implementation of a number of constructional solutions<br>
aimed at preventing fractures, for example, due to the different rates<br>
of thermal expansion of the materials employed (steel or other metals<br>
for the burner and pyroceram for the supporting surface), the cooking<br>
hobs made of said material do not present any structural or<br>
mechanical degradation to thermal stresses coming from the burners,<br>
even though they prove particularly expensive and difficult to model.<br>
In order to overcome the aforesaid drawbacks, and at the same time<br>
maintain the aesthetic characteristics and the characteristics of<br>
practicality of maintenance of the cooking hobs with supporting<br>
surfaces made of pyroceram, there have been produced supporting<br>
surfaces made of tempered glass, which, however, have proven<br>
extremely sensitive to the heat developed by the burners, thus<br>
presenting unfavourable phenomena of structural yielding during use.<br>
The high temperatures and the constant irradiation localized in the<br>
proximity of the burner, to which the surface made of tempered glass<br>
is subject during combustion, as well as the consequent presence of a<br>
steep temperature gradient between adjacent areas on the glass<br>
surface, frequently lead to the formation of fractures and/or<br>
phenomena of structural yielding of the cooking hob.<br>
In order to solve the above problem, it has been proposed to increase<br>
the diameter of the holes provided for housing the burners obtained in<br>
the surface made of tempered glass and to affix, for each hole, a<br><br>
metal plate on the supporting surface, in a position corresponding to<br>
the burner, in order to screen the irradiation coming from the burner<br>
and from the bottom part of the cooking recipient, and directed<br>
towards the surface made of tempered glass.<br>
Said solution, which entails the use of metal plates having a plan<br>
extension that is other than negligible, is able to prevent fractures in<br>
the cooking hob, but is aesthetically far from pleasant and constitutes<br>
an obstacle to cleaning of the cooking hob.<br>
In addition, in embodiments of cooking hobs known to the prior art, for<br>
example, from the British patent application GB-A-2.068.104, such<br>
metal plates may be shaped like concave containers or trays, at the<br>
centre of which is housed the burner. This implies the drawback of<br>
accumulation of grease and ashes in the plate, with consequent<br>
inconvenience for cleaning of the cooking hob, as well as the need to<br>
achieve a considerable precision of fabrication and of assembly of<br>
the plates, which need to have low dimensional tolerances, as<br>
compared to the specific techniques envisaged in the design phase.<br>
Finally, the gas burners used with said protective plates are generally<br>
of the type in which the intake of primary air takes place underneath<br>
the cooking hob, given the overall dimensions of the protective plate<br>
itself and the laborious problems involved in making air-inflow inlets set<br>
above said plate. Gas burners in which the flow of primary air for<br>
combustion comes from underneath the cooking hob are less efficient<br>
and usually of larger dimensions as compared to burners in which the<br>
primary air is taken in above the cooking hob and likewise involve the<br>
presence of appropriately designed air intakes in the supporting<br>
surface, which, above all in brittle materials, such as tempered glass,<br>
can prove difficult to produce.<br>
There is consequently felt the need to find a solution, alternative to the<br><br>
ones so far identified, which will enable the use of supporting surfaces<br>
for atmospheric gas burners made of tempered glass whilst, still<br>
retaining the same aesthetic qualities and the practicality of<br>
production and maintenance of the surfaces made of pyroceram<br>
and without the need to use burners in which the intake of primary air<br>
takes place underneath the cooking hob.<br>
As regards, instead, cooking hobs with a supporting surface made of<br>
stainless steel or other materials that are structurally resistant to heat<br>
but aesthetically degradable, such as enamelled steel, said cooking<br>
hobs fend, in the proximity of the burners, to undergo deformation and<br>
to change colour permanently, thus rendering the cooking hob itself<br>
somewhat unpleasant from the aesthetic point of view.<br>
Also for the above materials, there is felt the need to find solutions that<br>
will enable their use in cooking hobs provided with atmospheric gas<br>
burners, without there occurring any degradation in the appearance<br>
of the said cooking hob.<br>
The above-mentioned needs are met by the present invention, which<br>
provides a surprising solution to the drawbacks that arise with the use,<br>
for the supporting surface in cooking hobs comprising one or more<br>
atmospheric gas burners, of materials that are physically and/or only<br>
structurally degradable when set in the presence of heat sources.<br>
Consequently, a purpose of the present invention is to provide a<br>
cooking hob having a supporting surface for housing the burners<br>
which is made of a material that is degradable in the presence of<br>
thermal emissions, which does not present the drawbacks referred to<br>
above, and at the same time is of pleasant appearance and simple<br>
to produce and maintain.<br>
Another purpose of the present invention is to provide a cooking hob<br>
having a support made of a material that is degradable in the<br><br>
presence of thermal emissions and is provided with at least one gas<br>
burner, in which the latter is of the type that envisages the inflow of<br>
primary air from above the support that houses the burner itself.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The above and other purposes are achieved by the present invention,<br>
according to what is claimed in the first independent claim of use and<br>
in the subsequent dependent claims and according to what is<br>
claimed in the independent Claim 12 and in the subsequent product<br>
claims dependent thereon.<br>
According to the present invention, the solution to the drawbacks<br>
referred to above can be achieved by using, in a way that is unknown<br>
to the prior art and is in itself surprising, a gas burner of an atmospheric<br>
type provided with a burner base, a burner head having at least one<br>
flame crown, and a circumferential ring, the gas burner being set in a<br>
hole made in the supporting surface of a cooking hob which is made<br>
of a material, the physical characteristics or the structure of which are<br>
degradable in the proximity of heat sources. The circumferential ring is<br>
set between the flame crown and the supporting surface.<br>
The action of the circumferential ring, which is preferably shaped like a<br>
truncated cone with the major base facing the supporting surface, is<br>
that of shielding the latter from the irradiation coming from the burner<br>
and from the heated recipient, in order to prevent, in the proximity of<br>
the said burner, there being formed temperature gradients such as<br>
might cause fracturing of the said supporting surface. The<br>
circumferential ring also has the function of dissipating the heat<br>
transmitted by irradiation and by conduction along the burner.<br>
According to a preferred feature of the present invention, the<br>
circumferential ring is separate from the support of the cooking hob in<br>
such a way that the space existing between the support and the<br><br>
circumferential ring will enable passage of the primary air detected to the burner,<br>
this implying the use of a burner of the type in which the primary air is taken in<br>
above the cooking hub.<br>
In this way, the primary air inflow, which is drawn, for example, by a horizontal<br>
Venturi tube (also known as radial Venturi), with which the burner can be<br>
equipped, contributes to cooling down both the circumferential ring and the<br>
supporting surface in the proximity of the burner.<br>
According to a further feature of the present invention, the circumferential ring<br>
has a plan diameter greater than or equal to the diameter of the hole within<br>
which the burner is housed and preferably greater than or equal to the diameter<br>
of the flame crown.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the burner is of the type<br>
comprising two or more flame crowns, and the supporting surface is made of<br>
tempered glass.<br>
The present invention also intends to protect a cooking hob which has a support<br>
made of a material, the physical characteristics of which or the structure of which<br>
are degradable in the proximity of heat sources, and provided with at least one<br>
hole, within which is housed, at least partially, a gas burner of the type<br>
comprising a burner base and a burner head with at least one flame crown. Said<br>
burner is provided with a circumferential ring set between the flame crown and<br>
the supporting surface. Preferably, the circumferential ring is set at a distance<br>
from the supporting surface, and the primary air is taken in above the supporting<br>
surface and underneath said circumferential ring.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF SOME PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF THE<br>
INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates, with reference to Figure 1, to the use of at least<br>
one gas burner 2, 3a, 3b or 3c with one or more flame crowns in a cooking hob,<br>
for example, a domestic cooking hob, provided with a supporting surface 1 made<br>
of a material the physical characteristics of which or the structure of which are<br>
degradable in the presence of heat sources, such as, for example, tempered<br>
glass, stainless steel, or enamelled steel. The present invention likewise relates<br>
to a cooking hob having a support surface made of a degradable material.<br>
Figure 1 illustrates, then, purely by way of a non-limiting example, a cooking hob<br>
provided with a supporting surface 1, for example, made of tempered glass, on<br>
which are arranged, in purposely provided seats, a burner 2 with three flame<br>
crowns and three burners 3a, 3b, 3c having just one flame crown.<br><br>
As is illustrated in Figure 2, the burner 2 comprises, according to the<br>
present invention, a burner base 4 and a burner head 5 bearing the<br>
above-mentioned three flame crowns, as well as a circumferential<br>
ring 9 set between the flame crowns and the supporting surface 1. The<br>
outermost flame crown, defined in the burner head 5 by peripheral<br>
holes 26, can be seen in Figure 2.<br>
The base 4 of the burner 2 is housed in a circular hole made in the said<br>
supporting surface 1 (and set in a position corresponding to the portion<br>
designated by 22 in Figure 2), supported by a plurality of flat springs 8<br>
set opposite to a circular flange 7, between which is set the portion of<br>
the supporting surface 1 adjacent to the housing hole. The burner 2 is<br>
likewise provided with a supporting grill 6 for a cooking container.<br>
More in particular, with reference to Figure 3, the burner 2 comprises a<br>
base 4 set underneath the supporting surface 1, which is made of<br>
tempered glass, in which there is set an injector 23 for the combustible<br>
gas. The base 4 presents peripheral ramifications or projections 24,<br>
which engage in the seat of the supporting surface 1 and carry both<br>
the flange 7 and the flat springs 8. The coupling of the springs 8 to the<br>
circular flange 7 and the mutual clamping thereof, after prior<br>
interposition of the edges of the housing hole of the burner 2, enables<br>
stable fixing of the burner base 4 to the supporting surface 1.<br>
In alternative embodiments (not illustrated), the base 4 of the burner 2<br>
can be housed in a circular hole of the supporting surface 1, without<br>
coming into contact with the latter and being supported, for example,<br>
by elastic means, on a structural element of the cooking hob set<br>
underneath the supporting surface 1 and not visible to the user.<br>
According to the known art, above the base 4, and constrained<br>
thereto in a removable way, there is a burner head that has a central<br>
body 12, closed by a top lid 10 and equipped, once more according<br><br>
to the prior art, with a horizontal Venturi tube (or radial Venturi) 11 tor<br>
mixing ot the gas with the primary air, and with a distribution chamber<br>
having holes tacing outwards and designed to detine a first central<br>
flame crown. The burner head further comprises a toroidal body 13,<br>
which is surmounted by a an annular lid 14 and connected to the<br>
horizontal Venturi 11 and/or to the distribution chamber of the body 12<br>
by appropriate radial channels (not illustrated), and which presents an<br>
inner series of holes and an outer series of holes designed for defining,<br>
respectively, a second flame crown and a third flame crown. The<br>
second flame crown is, in particular, set in opposition to the first central<br>
flame crown, and the burner 2 is moreover provided with a grill 6<br>
designed for supporting a cooking container.<br>
The burner 2, moreover, is of the type in which the primary air I is taken<br>
in, thanks to the suction exerted by the Venturi 11, from above the<br>
supporting surface 1, penetrates, via channels (not illustrated), into the<br>
chamber defined by the burner base 4, and then is mixed with the gas<br>
coming out of the nozzle 23 in said horizontal Venturi (or radial Venturi)<br>
11. A burner of the type referred to above is known from the patent<br>
application EP-A-0.903.538 or from the publication EP-A-0.797.048, both<br>
of which are in the name of the present applicant.<br>
According to the present invention, the burner 2 likewise presents a<br>
circumferential ring 9, which is made of the same material as or of a<br>
material different from that of the burner, set coaxial to the vertical<br>
axis of the said burner and set between the flame crowns and the<br>
supporting surface 1 made of tempered glass. Advantageously, as will<br>
emerge clearly from what follows, the ring 9 is separate from the<br>
supporting surface 1, and the primary air I is induced to enter the<br>
burner above the supporting surface 1 and underneath the ring 9.<br>
The presence of the circumferential ring 9, which is conveniently set<br><br>
between the heat source, represented by the flame crown or flame<br>
crowns, and the supporting surface made of tempered giass, enables<br>
adequate shielding of the supporting surface made of tempered glass<br>
1 from the irradiation coming from the flame crowns and, albeit to a<br>
lesser extent, also from the irradiation coming from the heated<br>
cooking container.<br>
The above-mentioned shielding action, which brings about lowering of<br>
the temperature of those areas of the supporting surface 1 in the<br>
proximity of the burner 2, has surprisingly proved sufficient for<br>
preventing the substantial degradation of the material of which the<br>
supporting surface 1 is made. In the case of tempered glass, for<br>
example, the interposition of the ring 9 prevents the generation of<br>
fractures and makes possible the use of said economic material in the<br>
production of cooking hobs. Also when used with surfaces made of<br>
stainless steel or enamelled steel, the ring 9 has enabled reduction or<br>
elimination of the formation of halos or deformations of the supporting<br>
surface 1.<br>
In addition, the inflow of primary air 1, drawn by the Venturi 11, in the<br>
space made between the ring 9 and the supporting surface 1, which<br>
is substantially at room temperature, contributes to a cooling down by<br>
convection of both the supporting surface 1 and the circumferential<br>
ring 9. The contribution of the flow of primary air 1 in the action of local<br>
cooling is deemed particularly important, albeit not essential, in the<br>
case of brittle materials, such as tempered glass.<br>
Finally, the ring 9 acts also partially as a heat sink, by conduction, of<br>
the heat produced by the burner 2 itself, thus lowering the<br>
temperature of the latter in the proximity of the said ring 9 and, hence,<br>
the temperature in proximity of the hole housing the burner in the<br>
supporting surface 1.<br><br>
According to a preferential feature of the present invention, the plan<br>
diameter of the circumferential ring 9 is greater than the diameter of<br>
the hole present in supporting surface 1 made of tempered glass and<br>
is also greater than the plan diameter of the outermost flame crown<br>
defined by the toroidal body 13. In this way, the ring 9 extends, in plan<br>
view, from the burner base 4, or from the burner head 5, up to beyond<br>
the flame crown made along the outer perimeter of the toroidal body<br>
13.<br>
The above dimensions of the ring 9, which are much greater than the<br>
dimensions of similar rings made in burners provided in traditional<br>
cooking hobs, enable an effective shielding of the supporting surface<br>
underneath.<br>
The ring 9, as may be seen in Figure 3, is moreover preferably shaped<br>
substantially like a truncated cone with the major base facing the<br>
supporting surface 1 so as to prevent any possible residue of food that<br>
may come out of the cooking container from getting stuck on the ring<br>
9, with the risk of combustion thereof. Alternative embodiments of the<br>
ring 9 made with a convex shape have proven equally effective.<br>
Furthermore, the circumferential ring 9 may be made separately from<br>
the burner 2 and coupled, by juxtaposing the various parts, to the<br>
latter, but may also be made integrally with an element of the burner<br>
2 itself. For example, should the ring 9 be coupled to a burner of the<br>
type described in EP-A-0.797.048, i.e., a burner, which comprises an<br>
inner metal plate shaped for separation of the fluid flows, said ring 9<br>
may be made of a single piece with said inner metal plate, thus<br>
considerably simplifying its production.<br>
Materials that may be suitable for the production of the ring 9 are<br>
steel, aluminium alloys (Al-Si or Al-Ni), or other alloys or metal materials,<br>
such as brass, or else ceramics or plastic technopolymers with ceramic<br><br>
fillers or with fibre fillers that are resistant to high temperatures.<br>
Figure 4 illustrates another embodiment of the present invention, in<br>
which, on a cooking hob provided with a supporting surface 1 made<br>
of a thermally degradable material, there is fit an atmospheric gas<br>
burner 3 of the type comprising just one flame crown.<br>
The burner 3 comprises: a burner base 15 fit in a housing hole made on<br>
the supporting surface 1; elastic means for coupling to the supporting<br>
surface 1, which consist of one or more flat springs 21 and a circular<br>
flange 20 for being set opposite to said springs; a burner head 16; and<br>
a top lid 17. The base 15 is withheld in position thanks to the<br>
interposition of the edges of the hole for housing the supporting<br>
surface 1 between the spring 21 and the circular flange 20 and<br>
comprises a chamber, within which there is present an injector 23,<br>
fluid-connected to a pipe 25 for supplying the combustible gas.<br>
The burner head 16 of the burner comprises a horizontal Venturi 18,<br>
constituted, according to the known art, of a reduced section portion<br>
and of a radial expansion chamber, and is enclosed by the lid 17. At<br>
the radial ends of the expansion chamber there is a portion for<br>
distribution of the gas-primary air I mix, which presents a series of holes<br>
that form the flame crown of the burner 3. The burner 3 likewise<br>
presents, connected by interposition of parts, a circumferential ring 19;<br>
which extends from the burner head 16 of the burner up to beyond<br>
the flame crown. The said circumferential ring 19 is separate from the<br>
supporting surface 1 in order to enable inflow of the primary air I<br>
between the said supporting surface 1 and the ring 19.<br>
Also by using the burner 3, illustrated in Figure 4, the effect of shielding<br>
from irradiation and of cooling of the supporting surface 1 by the flow<br>
of the incoming primary air I, obtained thanks to the ring 19, enables<br>
the use of cooking hobs provided with supporting surfaces made of<br><br>
thermally degradable materials, such as, for example, tempered glass,<br>
stainless steel, or enamelled steel.<br><br>
