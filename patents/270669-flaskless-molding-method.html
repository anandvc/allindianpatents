				<td>FLASKLESS MOLDING METHOD<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a molding method, and, more particularly, to a flaskless<br>
molding method in which formed molds are removed from flasks after the molds are<br>
formed.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Japanese Early-Patent Publication No. 62 [this coresponds to the yearl987]-16736<br>
discloses a flaskless molding machine for molding stacked flaskless molds by using two<br>
pairs of a cope flask and a drag flask in which one cope flask and one drag flask form<br>
one pair. In this machine, mounted on the upper side of a machinery mount is a<br>
squeeze station that horizontally squeezes molding sand horizontally as viewed from<br>
the floor level. Further, mounted on the lower side or near the floor level is a stripping<br>
station for matching the molds and removing them vertically from the flasks as viewed<br>
from the floor level. Two pairs of the cope flask and the drag flask are alternately and<br>
intermittently and reciprocatingly moved between the squeeze station and the stripping<br>
station. With this arrangement, because an interchangeable match plate to be<br>
sandwiched between the cope and drag flasks can be exchanged near the floor level, the<br>
necessary labor is reduced.<br>
The foregoing conventional machine, however, may encounter a problem. It is that<br>
insufficient molding sand might be charged into the flasks, and thus the resulting molds<br>
might lack the desired hardness. Accordingly, there is a need for a flaskless molding<br>
method that can steadily and readily produce molds having the desired hardness.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides methods for molding stacked upper and lower molds<br>
with a flaskless molding machine that includes a cope flask and a drag flask. Each flask<br>
defines an opening and has at least one sand-filling port for injecting molding sand into<br>
the opening, a match plate having upper and lower patterns on top and bottom faces<br>
corresponding to the cope and drag flasks, and upper and lower squeezing members,<br>
each squeezing member being insertable in and retractable from the corresponding<br>
opening of the corresponding flask for squeezing the molding sand to be molded.<br>
1<br><br>
One of the methods comprises the steps of defining upper and lower molding spaces<br>
by inserting the upper and lower squeezing members into the respective openings of the<br>
respective flasks opposed to the respective patterns of the match plate such that the<br>
upper molding space is defined by the cope flask, the top face of the match plate, and the<br>
upper squeezing member, and the lower molding space is defined by the drag flask, the<br>
bottom face of the match plate, and the lower squeezing member, wherein each molding<br>
space has an initial volume; a first injection of the molding sand into each molding space<br>
that has the initial volume, from the sand-filling ports; increasing the volume in each<br>
molding space above the initial volume by retracting the upper and lower squeezing<br>
members by a predetermined length; a second injection of the molding sand into each<br>
molding space that has the increased volume, from the sand-filling ports; advancing the<br>
upper and lower squeezing members, followed by the second injecting step, to squeeze<br>
the molding sand within the upper and lower molding spaces to mold stacked upper and<br>
lower molds; and removing the resulting upper and lower molds from the cope and drag<br>
flasks.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, the cope and drag flasks are in their<br>
vertical positions during the steps of the first and second injections of the molding sand,<br>
whereas they are in their horizontal positions during the step of removing the resulting<br>
molds. In this case, the step of defining the molding spaces is carried out while the<br>
cope and drag flasks are returning from their horizontal positions, during which the<br>
stripping of the molds has been completed, to their vertical positions.<br>
Another method of the present invention comprises clamping and holding the match<br>
plate between the cope flask and the drag flask, wherein the cope and drag flasks are in<br>
their horizontal positions; defining upper and lower molding spaces by inserting the<br>
upper and lower squeezing members into the respective openings of the respective<br>
flasks opposed to the respective patterns of the match plate such that the upper molding<br>
space is defined by the cope flask, the top face of the match plate, and the upper<br>
squeezing member, and the lower molding space is defined by the drag flask, the bottom<br>
face of the match plate, and the lower squeezing member, wherein each molding space<br>
has an initial volume; turning the cope and drag flasks and the match plate to their<br>
vertical positions in unison; a first injection of the molding sand into each molding space<br>
that has the initial volume, from the sand-filling ports.; increasing the volume in each<br>
molding space above the initial volume by retracting the upper and lower squeezing<br>
members by a predetermined length; a second injection of the molding sand into<br>
each molding space that has the increased volume, from the sand-filling ports;<br>
2<br><br>
advancing the upper and lower squeezing members to squeeze the molding sand within<br>
the upper and lower molding spaces, while returning the cope and drag flasks and the<br>
match plate to their horizontal positions in unison; removing the match plate from the<br>
cope and drag flasks, wherein each flask contains a mold; stacking the cope flask and<br>
the drag flask; and removing the molds from the stacked cope and drag flasks.<br>
The method may, if necessary, further comprise the step of setting a core in each mold<br>
before the step of stacking the cope flask and the drag flask is carried out.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, the step of defining the molding spaces is<br>
carried out while the cope and drag flasks, and the match plate, are in their horizontal<br>
positions. During the step of turning the cope and drag flasks, and the match plate, to<br>
their vertical positions in unison, the sand-filling ports for injecting the molding move<br>
upward.<br>
In each method of the present invention, the step of the second injection may begin<br>
after each molding space has reached the desired volume and thus the step of increasing<br>
the volume in each molding space is completed. Alternatively, the step of the second<br>
injection may be applied while the upper and lower squeezing members are still<br>
retracted during the step of increasing the volume in each molding space such that the<br>
step of the second injection can begin before the step of increasing the volume in each<br>
molding space has been completed by reaching the desired volume.<br>
In each method of the present invention, each of the upper and lower squeeze<br>
members may be a squeezing plate or a squeezing foot.<br>

THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
3<br><br>
Figs. 1 to 4 show the flaskless molding machine to implement the molding method of the<br>
present invention. The molding machine includes a rectangular machinery mount<br>
whose inner chamber includes a station P for defining molding spaces, a sand-supplying<br>
station S, and a core setting/mold stripping station W.<br>
The station P, which defines the molding spaces, has two pairs of a cope flask 2 and a<br>
drag flask 3. Each flask defines an opening and has a sand-filling port on its sidewall for<br>
supplying molding sand. Although in this embodiment one flask has just one<br>
sand-filling port, one or more sand-filling ports may be provided with the one flask.<br>
The station P includes a shuttle 4 for carrying in and carrying out a match plate 5. Both<br>
faces of it are formed with patterns, between one of the two pairs of the cope flask 2 and<br>
the drag flask 3, and a squeezing mechanism 9. The squeezing mechanism 9 includes an<br>
upper squeeze plate 6 and a lower squeeze plate 7. They are insertable in and<br>
removable from the corresponding openings of the flasks that oppose the match plate 5<br>
when it is clamped and held between one pair of the core flask and the drag flask. The<br>
squeeze mechanism 9 is pivotally supported on a supporting shaft 8 that is mounted on<br>
the machinery mount such that the squeeze mechanism 9 can be reversiblely rotated<br>
about the supporting shaft 8 in the vertical plane. The range of the rotating or<br>
pivoting motion of the squeezing mechanism 9 is between the vertical position and<br>
horizontal position. In the vertical position, a pair of the cope flask 2 and the drag flask<br>
3 that are clamped and that hold the match plate 5 therebetween are in their vertical<br>
positions. Meanwhile, they are in their horizontal positions at the horizontal position of<br>
the rotating motion of the squeezing mechanism 9. The station P, which defines the<br>
molding spaces, also has a transverse cylinder 10 for reversiblely rotating the squeeze<br>
mechanism 9.<br>
The sand-supplying station S includes a sand-supplying device 11 for filling molding<br>
sand into a pair of the cope flask 2 and the drag flask 3 that have been in the vertical<br>
position, by extending the cylinder 10 through the sand-filling ports.<br>
The core setting/mold stripping station W includes mold-stripping equipment 12 for<br>
stripping the resulting upper half-mold and the lower half-mold from the paired cope<br>
and flask 2 and drag flask 3, which are positioned in their horizontal positions and<br>
which are stacked such that they contain the upper half-mold and the lower half-mold.<br>
The core setting/mold stripping station W also includes a rotating mechanism 13 for<br>
alternatively and intermittently rotating two pairs of the stacked cope flasks 2 and drag<br>
flasks 3 in the horizontal state, in which one pair of the flasks and another pair of flasks<br>
are deposed in a parallel relation on a horizontal level, one at a time, between the<br>
4<br><br>
squeezing mechanism 9 and the mold-stripping device 12. The rotating mechanism 13<br>
also can be engaged with each cope flask 2 to move it up and down.<br>
In each pair of the cope flask 2 and drag flask 3 of the two pairs, as shown in Fig. 1 a<br>
pair of connecting rods 14 is vertically and slidably suspended from the front and rear<br>
sides of the cope flask 2. The lower ends of the connecting rods 14 can be engaged with<br>
the drag flask 3.<br>
Engaging members 2a are attached to the center positions of the opposed sides of the<br>
cope flask 2, while engaging members 3a are attached to the ends of the opposed sides of<br>
the drag flask 3 when it is in the squeezing mechanism 9 such that the one pair of the<br>
cope flask 2 and the drag flask 3 can be supported by the rotating mechanism 13. For<br>
example, each engaging member 2a or 3a may have a convex shape with a bore for<br>
receiving a pin (not shown) so as to be connected to a mating upper engaging member 37<br>
or the mating lower engaging member 39 (discussed below) of the rotating mechanism<br>
13. Because the profile of each engaging member 2a or 3a may take any form that is<br>
suitable for being connected or detachably attached to the mating engaging member 37<br>
or 39, it may take, e.g., a concave profile.<br>
As shown in Fig. 1, the shuttle 4 for carrying the match plate includes a ring<br>
member 15 that is fitted on the supporting shaft 8 of the squeezing mechanism 9, and a<br>
cylinder 16, which is pivotally attached to the sand-supplying device 11. The end of a<br>
piston rod of the cylinder 16 is pivotally connected to a portion of the ring member 15.<br>
The shuttle 4 also includes a pair of cantilevered arms 17, the bases of the ends are<br>
attached to the ring member 15. The shuttle 4 also includes a suspended truck 45 that<br>
is laterally movable when the match plate 5 is placed on it. The truck 45 is lowered by<br>
a predetermined, relatively short, distance by means of the cope flask 2, while the<br>
paired and cantilevered arms 17 are pivoted up and down by a telescopic motion of the<br>
cylinder 16 such that the arms 17 are engaged with and disengaged from the truck 45.<br>
The truck 45 runs on rails (not shown) that are provided on the cope flask 2 and the<br>
drag flask 3, to carry in and carry out the match plate 5 between the horizontal cope<br>
flask 2 and drag flask 3 in the squeezing mechanism 9.<br>
To move the arms 17, the cylinder 16 may be replaced with, e.g., a motor, etc.<br>
In the squeezing mechanism 9, as shown in Fig. 4, a rotating frame 18 is rotatably<br>
fitted to the approximate center portion of the supporting shaft 8, which is mounted on<br>
the center of the upper surface of the machinery mount 1. The rotating frame 18 can<br>
thus be reversibly rotated in the vertical plane. The right side of the rotating frame 18<br>
is provided with a pair of vertical, elongated guiding arms 19. The guiding arms 19 are<br>
positioned in the rear and front in relation to each other, to form a predetermined<br>
5<br><br>
distance therebetween. A reverse-L-shaped upper vertically-moving frame 20 and an<br>
L-shaped lower vertically-moving frame 21 are vertically and slidably mounted on and<br>
across the upper portions and the lower portions, respectively, of two guiding rods 19, by<br>
means of holders, each of which is integrally provided with a corresponding frame 20 or<br>
21. The upper vertically-moving frame 20 and the lower vertically-moving frame 21<br>
can be moved close to and away from each other by a telescopic motion of an<br>
upwardly-facing cylinder 22 and a downwardly-facing cylinder 23, respectively. These<br>
cylinders 22, 23 are mounted on the rotating frame 18.<br>
The upper vertically-moving frame 20 has a plurality of cylinders 24 for advancing<br>
and retracting the upper squeezing plate 6, while the lower vertically-moving frame 21<br>
has a plurality of cylinders 25 for advancing and retracting the lower squeezing plate 7.<br>
The horizontal surface of each squeezing plate 6 or 7 has a cross section that suffices to<br>
press the corresponding cope or drag flask 2 or 3.<br>
In this embodiment, the cylinders for driving the squeezing plates 6 and 7 cooperate<br>
to move in unison with the rotating frame 18. Alternatively, the cylinders may be fixed<br>
on the fixed portions. Further, one group of the cylinders of the squeezing plate 6 or 7<br>
may cooperatively move in unison with the rotating frame, and the other group of<br>
cylinders, of the corresponding squeezing plate, may be fixed on the fixed portion.<br>
In this embodiment, the sand-supplying device 11, which is mounted on the top of<br>
the machinery mount 1 (near the left side in the figure), includes two aeration tanks 27<br>
so as to separately introduce the molding sand into the cope flask 2 and the drag flask 3,<br>
while the injected molding sand is floated or fluidized ("aeration- injecting process ") by<br>
compressed air with a low pressure. Typically, however, just one aeration tank may be<br>
used to fill the molding sand into both the cope flask 2 and the drag flask 3.<br>
The aeration-injecting sand for floating or fluidizing the molding sand using the<br>
compressed air with the low pressure is disclosed, in, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 6,749,003 B2,<br>
assigned to the applicant of the present application. It was found that the desirable<br>
pressures of the low-pressure air are from 0.05 Mpa to 0.18 Mpa. However, a suitable<br>
injecting process that can be used for the present invention is not limited to the<br>
fluidizing and injecting process. For example, a blowing injecting process using<br>
compressed air with a higher pressure may be used in the present invention.<br>
Alternatively, the sand-supplying device 11 may be connected to a decompressor (not<br>
shown) to be used together with air at a low pressure, i.e., below atmospheric pressure,<br>
in either the aeration-injecting process or the blowing-injecting process.<br>
The mold-stripping device 12 includes a stripping plate 28, which is insertable in<br>
and retractable from the overlapped horizontal cope flask 2 and drag flask 3. That<br>
6<br><br>
stripping plate 28 is attached to the lower end of the piston rod of a downwardly-facing<br>
cylinder 29 that is mounted on the roof of the machinery mount 1. The stripping plate<br>
28 can be moved vertically by a telescopic motion of the cylinder 29. Placed<br>
intermediately below the stripping plate 28 is a receiving table 30 for receiving an upper<br>
half-mold and a lower half-mold to be withdrawn from the cope flask 2 and the drag<br>
flask 3, respectively. Preferably, the receiving table 30 is moved vertically by a<br>
pantograph 32 that can be extended and retracted by telescopic motions of a cylinder 31.<br>
The pantograph 32 may be replaced with a common lift table that is moved by a suitable<br>
cylinder. However, using the pantograph 32 as a driver for elevationally moving the<br>
receiving device 30, as in this embodiment, requires no pit for receiving the driver on<br>
the floor level on which the molding machine is installed (see Fig. 2).<br>
In the rotating mechanism 13, a vertically elongated, rotary shaft 33 is horizontally<br>
and rotatably mounted on the machinery mount 1. The upper end of the rotary shaft<br>
33 is connected to the output of a motor 34, which is mounted on the top of the<br>
machinery mount 1. The rotary shaft 33 can be reversibly turned within a turning<br>
range of 180° by driving the motor 34. The motor 34 may be replaced with a suitable<br>
cylinder.<br>
The turning range of 180° of the rotary shaft 33 is just an example of its possible<br>
turning ranges for transferring the resulting mold from the on-site position where the<br>
mold is formed to the mold-stripping equipment 12 by the rotating mechanism 13.<br>
Because this turning range is defined and based on the site where the mold-stripping<br>
equipment 12 is installed, it is not limited to the 180°. The equipment 12 may be<br>
installed in any site, based on the desirable turning range of the shaft.<br>
The upper portion of the rotary shaft 33 has a supporting member 35 from which<br>
two pairs of guiding rods 36 are suspended. They are arranged in a back and front<br>
relationship to form a predetermined distance therebetween such that they are opposed<br>
to each other across the rotary shaft 33 that is centered therebetween. The upper<br>
engaging member 37 is vertically and slidably fitted on each pair of the guiding rods 36<br>
to engage the engaging members 2a. The upper engaging member 37 is attached to the<br>
distal end of the piston rod of the cylinder 38 that is mounted on the rotary shaft 33. The<br>
upper engaging member 37 can thus be vertically moved by a telescopic motion of the<br>
cylinder 38. The lower ends of the two pairs of the guiding rods 36 are attached to a<br>
lower engaging member 39, which that can be engaged to the engaging members 3a of<br>
the two drag flasks 3.<br>
One of the functions of a mold ejector 40 is to push out the upper and lower<br>
half-molds, which are drawn from the cope flask 2 and the drag flask 3, from the<br>
7<br><br>
receiving table 30.<br>
With the molding method of the present invention, first, the match plate 5 is<br>
carried in between the horizontal cope and drag flasks 2 and 3 by extending the cylinder<br>
16 of the shuttle 4.<br>
The cope flask 2 and the drag flask 3 are then moved closer to each other by means<br>
of the upper and lower vertically-moving frames 20 and 21 by retracting both the<br>
upwardly-facing cylinder 22 and the downwardly-facing cylinder 23 of the squeezing<br>
mechanism 9. The cope flask 2 and the drag flask 3 are then clamped, and hold the<br>
match plate 5 therebetween, while the clustered cylinders 24 and 25 are extended by a<br>
predetermined stroke length. This causes the upper squeeze plate 6 and the lower<br>
squeeze plate 7 to be inserted in the openings of the cope flask 2 and the drag flask 3 by<br>
a predetermined length, to define an upper molding space and a lower molding space.<br>
As used herein, the volume of each molding space in this state refers to the initial<br>
volume. The predetermined stroke length of the extending motion of the clustered<br>
cylinder 24 or 25 and thus the predetermined length of the insertion of the upper<br>
squeeze plate 6 or the lower squeeze plate 7 corresponds to the initial volume of the<br>
molding space to be defined. In addition, the clustered cylinders 24, 25 may be<br>
replaced with a combination of just one large-diameter cylinder and a guide pin.<br>
When the upper and lower molding spaces, each of which has the initial volume, are<br>
defined, the cylinder 10 is extended to rotate the squeeze mechanism 9 clockwise about<br>
the supporting shaft 8 such that the paired cope and drag flasks 2 and 3, and the match<br>
plate 5, are positioned at their vertical positions while the sand-filling ports are raised.<br>
The raised sand-filling ports abut the lower ends of the two aeration tanks 27 of the<br>
sand-supplying device 11 (see Fig. 4).<br>
If the height of the cope flask 2 is the same as that of the drag flask 3, the paired<br>
molding spaces may be simultaneously defined. Alternatively, if the cope flask 2 and<br>
the drag flask 3 have different heights, two molding spaces may be separately defined at<br>
different times.<br>
In the sand-injecting station S, the sand-supplying device 11 then injects the<br>
molding sand into the paired upper and lower molding spaces through the sand-filling<br>
ports (a first injection step), using any suitable injecting method, such as aeration<br>
injecting with compressed air that has a low pressure, namely, below atmospheric<br>
pressure.<br>
The clustered cylinders 24 and 25 are retracted by the predetermined stroke length<br>
to retract the upper and lower squeeze plates 6 and 7 in immediate proximity to the<br>
corresponding openings of the paired cope flask 6 and drag flask 7. Therefore, the<br>
8<br><br>
volume of each molding space is increased from its initial volume.<br>
The sand-supplying device 11 then re-injects the molding sand into the increased<br>
upper and lower molding spaces through the sand-filling ports (a second injection step).<br>
The paired cope flask 2 and drag flask 3, and the match plate 5, are returned to their<br>
horizontal positions. During this movement, the clustered cylinders 24, 25 are<br>
extended such that the upper squeezing plate 6 and lower squeezing plate 7 move into<br>
the corresponding flasks to squeeze the molding sand within the two molding spaces.<br>
Accordingly, the molding sand is squeezed, followed by the two steps of injecting the<br>
molding sand. During them the first injecting step is carried out when each molding<br>
space has the initial volume. The second injecting step is applied to the increased<br>
molding spaces. The two steps of injecting the molding sand result in the increased<br>
hardness of the mold. This remarkable effect may be seen at the portions of the molds<br>
near the openings of the paired cope flask 2 and drag flask 3 that contain the molds.<br>
In the two steps of injecting the molding sand in this embodiment, the first injecting<br>
step is applied to the molding spaces, each of which has the initial volume. The second<br>
injecting step is applied after the increased volumes of the molding spaces, caused by<br>
retracting the upper and lower squeeze plates 6 and 7, have been completed.<br>
About the beginning of the second injecting step, however, it is not necessary to wait<br>
until the increased volumes of the old spaces have been completed. For example,<br>
followed by the first injecting step, while the upper and lower squeeze plates 6 and 7 are<br>
being retracted (and thus the volumes of the molding spaces are being increased), the<br>
second injecting step may be begun. Accordingly, the blowing of the molding sand into<br>
the molding spaces may be continued without any interruption between the first<br>
injection step and the second injection step.<br>
Following the two steps of injecting the molding sand, the upwardly-facing cylinder<br>
22 and the downwardly-facing cylinder 23 are extended such that the upper<br>
vertically-moving frame 20 and the lower vertically-moving frame 21 are spaced apart<br>
from each other.<br>
In the core setting / mold drawing station W, the cope flask 2, which contains the<br>
half-mold, which is produced by squeezing the molding sand, is lifted by means of the<br>
upper engaging member 37 to separate it from the match plate 5 by extending the<br>
cylinder 38 of the rotating mechanism 13. Meanwhile, the drag flask 3 is disposed on<br>
the lower engaging member 39 of the rotating member 13. The match plate 5 is then<br>
carried out from between the cope flask 2 and the drag flask 3 by means of the paired<br>
arms 17, by retracting the cylinder 16.<br>
The motor 34 of the rotating mechanism 13 is driven to turn the rotary shaft 33 in a<br>
9<br><br>
predetermined range such that the paired upper flask 2 and drag flask 3, each of which<br>
contains a mold, are transferred to the mold-stripping equipment 12. A core may then<br>
be disposed in each mold, if necessary. The cylinder 38 is then retracted to lower the<br>
cope flask 2 that contains the mold by means of the engaging member 37 such that the<br>
cope flask 2 and the drag flask 3 are stacked.<br>
The cylinder 31 of the mold-stripping equipment 12 is then extended to rise on the<br>
receiving table 30 such that the cope flask 2 and drag flask 3 that contain the molds are<br>
disposed on the receiving table 30. The cylinder 29 of the mold-stripping equipment 12<br>
is extended such that the stripping plate 28 contacts the half-mold within the cope flask<br>
2. The cylinder 31 is then retracted to lower the stripping plate 28 and the receiving<br>
table 30 in a cooperative relationship to strip the half-molds from the paired cope flask 2<br>
and drag flasks 3. The cylinder 31 is then retracted at the level at which the<br>
half-molds are to be ejected such that the ejector 40 is pushed off the paired upper and<br>
lower half-molds from the receiving table 40.<br>
In the above-described processes, it is desirable that a core be put in each formed<br>
half-mold, if so needed. If so, a core is put in each preceding formed half-mold before<br>
the cope flask 2 and the drag flask 3, each containing a new formed half-mold, are<br>
rotated and thus transferred to the mold-stripping equipment 12. The paired cope<br>
flask 2 and drag flask 3 are then stacked on each other to push out the half-molds in<br>
them, as discussed above.<br>
Although the present invention has been described with reference to the illustrative<br>
embodiments, they are not intended to limit the present invention. It will be apparent<br>
that various modifications can be made without departing from the spirit of the present<br>
invention, as set forth in the appended claims.<br>
For example, although the squeezing means are shown as the upper and lower<br>
squeezing plates 6 and 7, they may be replaced with squeeze feet that are separately<br>
controllable by means of restrictive hydraulic cylinders, and are arranged in respective<br>
segments.<br>
