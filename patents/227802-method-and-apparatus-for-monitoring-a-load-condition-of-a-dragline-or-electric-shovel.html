				<td>Method and apparatus for monitoring a load<br>
condition of a dragline or electric shovel<br>
The present invention relates to draglines and<br>
electric shovels, such as used in open cast (or open cut)<br>
mining, and more particularly to a method and apparatus for<br>
monitoring their boom load conditions. In what follows,<br>
the teachings are given for a dragline, it being understood<br>
that they apply mutatis mutandis to an electric shovel. A<br>
dragline is a piece of machinery used for scooping ground<br>
material by means of a bucket suspended from a boom.<br>
Figure 1 is a simplified diagram of a classical<br>
dragline 1. It comprises a base unit 2, a boom 4 having a<br>
proximal end 4a depending from the base unit and a distal<br>
end 4b fitted, with a pulley (also known as a sheave wheel)<br>
6, from which a bucket 8 is suspended by a metal (steel)<br>
cable, referred to hereafter as a hoist rope 10. The base<br>
unit 2 comprises an elevated structure 12 for passing the<br>
hoist rope 10 to the pulley 6. In the example, this<br>
structure includes a mast 14 at the front portion (seen<br>
from the pulley) and stays 16, from which the hoist rope 10<br>
connects to a drive point in the base unit 2. The hoist<br>
rope is thereby driven from a motor drive in the base unit<br>
to raise and lower the bucket 8 as required. The boom 4<br>
can be driven to swing in an azimuthal (horizontal) plane<br>
by an electric swing motor, and thereafter blocked at a set<br>
azimuth. In the example, the swing axis SW passes through<br>
the base unit 2, the latter being mounted on rotary<br>
platform.<br>
The bucket 8 is pulled towards base unit 2<br>
substantially along the ground (horizontal) plane by<br>
another metal (steel) cable, referred to hereafter as a<br>
drag rope 18, to carry out the scooping action. The drag<br><br>
rope 18 is attached at one end 18a to anchoring points 8a,<br>
8b of the bucket, so that bucket's opening 8c is kept<br>
horizontal and facing the base unit 2. The other end of<br>
the drag rope is connected to an electrically-driven winch<br>
(not shown) within the base unit 2.<br>
In operation, the distal end 4b of boom 4 is<br>
initially positioned over the zone where material 20 is to<br>
be scooped, typically 70-100m above the ground. The hoist<br>
rope 10 is initially adjusted to suspend the bucket 8<br>
vertically (dotted lines) with its opening 8c confronting<br>
piled material 20 to be scooped. The drag rope 18 is then<br>
driven to exert a tractive force TF which drags the bucket<br>
along the ground plane, thereby picking up material 20<br>
through the opening 8c. At the same time, the portion of<br>
the hoist rope 10 hanging from the pulley 6 is lengthened<br>
to maintain the bucket suspended following along the<br>
horizontal path of the ground. After the bucket has been<br>
dragged over a certain distance, filled, and lifted at some<br>
distance above the ground by hoist rope, the boom 4 is<br>
swung to place the bucket over a dumping zone.<br>
The bucket is then arranged to drop the material, e.g.<br>
by tilting the bucket using an appropriate mechanism.<br>
The dragline constitutes a large scale structure,<br>
with a boom length of 80 metres or more and a bucket<br>
capacity of up to 250 tonnes. The forces exerted on the<br>
boom 4 result from a combination of the tractive force TF<br>
exerted by the drag rope 18 and the suspending force SF<br>
exerted on the hoist rope 10. In particular, the hoist<br>
rope transfers a very high load to the boom, notably during<br>
the hoisting phases for lifting and during swinging of the<br>
boom.<br>
Under ideal operating conditions, the bucket 8, hoist;<br>
rope 10 and drag rope 18 are maintained in azimuthal<br><br>
alignment with the principal axis of the boom BA (boom<br>
axis), i.e. the boom, hoist rope and drag rope are kept<br>
substantially in the same general plane, in alignment with<br>
the horizontal projection of the boom, as shown in figure 2.<br>
These alignments should ideally be maintained as the bucket<br>
8 is pulled and the hoist rope 10 thereby subtends an<br>
evolving angle Î± (figure 1) with the vertical in the<br>
vertical plane containing the boom 4 . In this way, the<br>
forces TF and SF on the boom are coplanar with the boom and<br>
exert a compressive force on its structure. In particular,<br>
the lateral stress LS on the boom, which would exert a<br>
lateral bending moment, is zero under those ideal<br>
conditions.<br>
To meet the load demands, the boom 4 constitutes a<br>
complex mechanical structure made of steel, typically as a<br>
trellis box frame. The boom is a major limiting factor in<br>
the production rate of the dragline.<br>
If the boom is overloaded, it will crack and cause<br>
downtime on the machine. If it is badly overloaded, it<br>
will cause complete failure of the structure. This is a<br>
major safety issue within a mine and can result in a fatal<br>
accident.<br>
The boom 4 is usually specified for operation under<br>
these idealised working conditions, notably as regards its<br>
safe working load limits. With a proper control of the<br>
stresses within the boom structure, it would be possible to<br>
allow for a controlled overload of the dragline. This<br>
would give an improvement in output for a very low extra<br>
cost. Savings in terms of work efficiency under these<br>
circumstances can be typically on the order of hundreds of<br>
thousands of dollars per year per dragline.<br>
It is known in the art to equip the boom with strain<br>
gauges at critical points to provide the dragline operator<br><br>
with a computer display showing stress-related parameters.<br>
This method, however, has the disadvantage of requiring<br>
rather complex calculations based on the boom structure<br>
characteristics, which may vary from one dragline to<br>
another.<br>
The present invention is based on considering the real<br>
working conditions, and more particularly the observation<br>
that the aforementioned ideal coplanar alignment conditions<br>
of the boom 4 with the hoist rope 10 and/or the drag rope<br>
18 and/or the bucket 8 are not always maintained.<br>
Indeed, the bucket 8 can be dragged, and then hoisted,<br>
while it is out of alignment with the plane of the boom<br>
axis BA. This can arise since, even if the bucket's stable<br>
equilibrium point is in alignment with the boom axis when<br>
placed on the ground, it does not always advance smoothly<br>
when being dragged. For instance, the bucket can slide<br>
sideways on a slanted ground profile or the swing motors of<br>
the dragline can be activated while the bucket still has<br>
ground contact. Both - and other - effects can take the<br>
bucket some distance to one side or the other of the boom<br>
axis. This misalignment is a key issue notably during the<br>
hoisting and swinging phases for emptying the bucket 8.<br>
This situation is illustrated schematically in figures<br>
3a, 3b and 3c, which illustrate respectively a laterally<br>
misaligned bucket 8 and hoist rope 10 during the scooping<br>
operation (bucket along -the ground), during a bucket<br>
hoisting operation, and a boom/bucket swing operation. As<br>
shown in figure 3a, the hoist rope 10 is laterally<br>
misaligned by an angle (3 with respect to the vertical<br>
alignment of the boom axis BA. The force SF on that hoist<br>
rope thus creates on the boom 4 a lateral stress LS<br>
proportional to SF * sin Î². When the hoist rope is raising<br>
the bucket and subsequently swinging it to a dumping point,<br><br>
the full weight BW of the suspended bucket and payload is<br>
applied to the distal end of the boom, with a consequently<br>
large lateral force component SF.<br>
The risk of dangerous levels of lateral force LF is<br>
both of material damage to the boom and its fixtures, e.g.<br>
the mast 14 and stays 16 of the elevated structure 12 and<br>
to personnel operating in the vicinity should the boom<br>
become damaged or break. It is to be noted that a dragline<br>
boom 4 is of considerable cost to repair or replace, owing<br>
to its large size and special construction, and moreover<br>
the downtime on a dragline is also very costly in terms of<br>
lost production.<br>
In view of the foregoing, the present invention seeks<br>
to assess the alignment/misalignment conditions of the boom,<br>
ropes and bucket, enabling to have at disposal critical<br>
information about the out of plane forces being applied to<br>
the dragline structure, or equivalently on an electric<br>
shovel.<br>
The present invention offers a method and apparatus<br>
for automatically monitoring that the aforementioned<br>
alignment conditions with the plane of the boom axis, or<br>
equivalently on an alignment axis of an electric shovel.<br>
More particularly, the invention provides, according<br>
to a first object, a method of monitoring a load condition<br>
of a dragline or an electric shovel, the dragline<br>
comprising a boom, a bucket, a hoist rope from which the<br>
bucket is suspended from the boom, and a drag rope for<br>
dragging the bucket, the boom extending substantially along<br>
a boom axis in its normal, unstressed state,<br>
characterised in that it comprises the step of:<br>
using technical means to produce alignment data<br>
indicative of the alignment, with respect to the plane<br><br>
containing said boom axis, of at least one of the following<br>
dragline components:<br>
i) the hoist rope,<br>
ii) the drag rope,<br>
iii) the boom,<br>
iv) the bucket.<br>
Optional aspects are presented as follows.<br>
The method can be implemented as a method of<br>
controlling a load condition of a dragline or electric<br>
shovel, by further comprising a step of controlling the<br>
aforementioned load condition of the dragline or electric<br>
shovel on the basis of the alignment data.<br>
The alignment data can be inputted to a man-machine<br>
interface, e.g. a display device, whereby the controlling<br>
step is performed via a human operator.<br>
The alignment data can be inputted to automated<br>
control means for controlling at least one of:<br>
i) the drive motor(s) of the hoist rope,<br>
ii) the drive motor(s) of the drag rope,<br>
iii) the drive motor(s) of the boom, for swinging<br>
the boom,<br>
to perform the controlling step.<br>
The controlling step can be performed substantially in<br>
real time using a feedback of the alignment data.<br>
The controlling step can be performed in a combined<br>
manner by a human operator via a man-machine interface and<br>
by automated control means.<br>
The controlling step can comprises authorising a<br>
controlled overload of the dragline or electric shovel,<br>
notably when controlling a maximum structure stress thereon,<br>
as a function of the alignment data.<br>
The method can be implemented with a boom having a<br>
specified maximum load limit, wherein the controlling step<br><br>
can comprise authorising a controlled overload of the boom<br>
above that specified load limit as a function of the<br>
alignment data.<br>
In one embodiment the information on the<br>
alignment/misalignment is fed into the dragline or electric<br>
shovel control system to automate the response to a thus-<br>
detected overload condition, and to control the maximum<br>
structure stress. In this way, the controls can be slowed<br>
or otherwise modified intelligently to ensure that there is<br>
no excessive stress (dangerous level of stress) while<br>
applying a controlled overload above standard<br>
manufacturers' limits.<br>
The technical means can be used to produce the<br>
alignment data as quantitative data indicative of an amount<br>
of misalignment in at least one aforementioned dragline<br>
component.<br>
The alignment data can be obtained by measurement on a<br>
pulley along which the hoist rope passes to hang from a<br>
distal end of the boom.<br>
The pulley can be configured to sway (i.e. tilt or<br>
lean sideways) in response to a lateral stress from the<br>
hoist rope, and the alignment data can be obtained by<br>
determining the amount of sway of the pulley.<br>
The alignment data can be obtained by measuring a<br>
lateral stress exerted on the pulley, e.g. by strain gauge<br>
means on the pulley structure.<br>
The alignment data can be obtained by physical contact<br>
with at least one aforementioned dragline component.<br>
The method can comprise physically engaging the hoist<br>
rope with an angular or linear displacement sensor device.<br>
The alignment data can be obtained by detecting a<br>
lateral deflection of the boom from the boom axis.<br><br>
The lateral deflection can be detected by producing<br>
an optical beam from a source attached to the boom,<br>
preferably at or near a distal end, and detecting a<br>
displacement of the beam spot where it impinges a target.<br>
The alignment data can be obtained by imaging at<br>
least one dragline component.<br>
The method can comprise imaging the hoist rope using<br>
camera means.<br>
The alignment data can be obtained by analysing<br>
coordinate data from GPS receiver means, at least one GPS<br>
receiver being positioned on the boom.<br>
The alignment data can be obtained by surveying<br>
techniques, to determine coordinate evolutions of a portion<br>
of the boom susceptible of deflecting laterally with<br>
respect to its boom axis.<br>
The method can comprise surveying a target<br>
substantially at the distal end of the boom using a<br>
surveying device, preferably a self-tracking total station<br>
placed at a known reference point on the dragline.<br>
According to a second aspect, the invention relates to<br>
an apparatus for monitoring a load condition of a dragline:<br>
or an electric shovel, the dragline comprising a boom, a<br>
bucket, a hoist rope from which the bucket is suspended<br>
from the boom, and a drag rope for dragging the bucket, the<br>
boom extending substantially along a boom axis in its<br>
normal, unstressed state,<br>
characterised in that it comprises means for<br>
producing alignment data indicative of the alignment, with<br>
respect to the plane containing the boom axis, of at least<br>
one of the following dragline components:<br>
i) the hoist rope,<br>
ii) the drag rope,<br>
iii) the boom,<br><br>
iv) the bucket.<br>
The optional aspects presented above in the context of<br>
the method according to the first object can be applied<br>
mutatis mutandis to the apparatus according to the second<br>
object.<br>
The alignment data can be used to assess/control loads<br>
on any component of the dragline or electric shovel, e.g.<br>
the boom 4, the mast 14, stays 16, drag and hoist ropes 8,<br>
18, bucket 8, fixtures, mounts, the platform, axles, etc.<br>

principle of a feedback control of a motor drive for the<br>
hoist rope and/or drag rope, and/or boom swing, based on<br>

invention, and applicable to any of the embodiments.<br>
The description of the preferred embodiments is based<br>
on the dragline already described with reference to figures<br>
1 to 3 inclusive. These figures and their description are<br>
not repeated for the sake of conciseness. The teachings<br>
can be transposed to an electric shovel.<br>
In what follows, the terms lateral misalignment (or<br>
more succinctly misalignment), or angle of misalignment,<br>
are referenced with respect to the plane containing the<br>
axis BA of the boom 4 in its normal, straight (undeflected)<br>
condition. Unless otherwise stated, the boom axis BA<br>
refers to the theoretical axis with no lateral distortion.<br>
For the hoist rope 10, the lateral misalignment is<br>
assessed as an angle (3 on a vertical plane, transverse to<br><br>
the boom axis BA, subtended by the hoist rope with respect;<br>
to the vertical.<br>
For the drag rope 18, the lateral misalignment is<br>
assessed as an angle on a horizontal plane, subtended by<br>
the drag rope with the projection of the boom axis BA on<br>
that horizontal plane.<br>
For the boom itself, the lateral misalignment<br>
expresses a distortion of the boom in a lateral direction,<br>
causing the distal end 4b of the boom to be laterally<br>
displaced in a horizontal plane with respect to its<br>
alignment along the (normal) boom axis BA.<br>
The following embodiments of the invention describe a<br>
number of different means for detecting one or more among<br>
the following conditions:<br>
i) a lateral flexing of the boom 4,<br>
ii) a line, or lines, of force having at least a<br>
component causing a lateral stress LS on the boom,<br>
iii) a lateral misalignment of the hoist rope 10,<br>
bucket 8 or of the drag rope 18 with respect to the boom<br>
axis BA.<br>
These means can be mechanical, and/or<br>
optical/electrooptical, and/or radiofrequency, and and/or<br>
other.<br>
The information is used for assessing and controlling<br>
the load conditions on the boom 4, and/or any other<br>
component of the dragline, such as the mast 14, stays 16,<br>
elevated structure 12 components, anchoring points,<br>
linkages, the mounting platform, bearings, fixtures, etc.<br>
First are described embodiments which use the pulley<br>
6 suspending the hoist rope 10 at the distal end 4b of the<br>
boom 4 as the means for detecting a lateral stress/lateral<br>
misalignment of the hoist rope.<br><br>
Figure 4 illustrates a type of pulley mechanism<br>
sometimes used in draglines, in which the pulley 6 is<br>
mounted on bearings 22 which allow some controlled swaying,<br>
i.e. tilting movement of pulley axle 24. In the figure,<br>
the pulley axle 24 is also shown in a tilted position<br>
(dotted lines) in response to the hoist rope 10 being<br>
laterally misaligned. The swaying force is transmitted by<br>
the hoist rope pressing on one of the inner sidewalls of<br>
the pulley's guiding groove. Assuming that the general<br>
plane of the pulley 6 sways to follow exactly the angle of<br>
the hoist rope's misalignment, the corresponding angular<br>
offset (3 of the pulley axle 24 when thus tilted is equal to<br>
the angle of the rope's misalignment.<br>
Figure 5 shows a first embodiment based on the pulley<br>
mechanism of figure 4, in which the swaying motion of the<br>
pulley and pulley axle is determined by distance measuring<br>
sensors. In the example, two distance measuring sensors<br>
26a and 26b are provided on the surface portions of the<br>
bearing casing that confront respective outer side faces 6a,<br>
6b of the pulley. The sensors 26a, 26b are arranged to<br>
measure the distance, respectively L1 and L2, from their<br>
location to a respective outer side face 6a, 6b of the<br>
pulley, this distance being measured along a direction<br>
parallel to the unswayed pulley axle 24, i.e. perpendicular<br>
to the pulley outer side faces when unswayed. The sensors<br>
26a, 26b can be of any known suitable technology, e.g.<br>
optical (such as laser based) or acoustic, comprising an<br>
optical/acoustic source and a sensor analysing the returned<br>
laser/acoustic signal to derive the distance measurements<br>
S1, S2.<br>
The sensors 26a and 26b are mounted symmetrically<br>
such that when the hoist rope 10 is aligned with the boom<br>
axis, the distances L1 and L2 measured by the sensors 26a<br><br>
and 26b are the same. Differences between the distances L1<br>
and L2 measured by the sensors therefore express the angle<br>
of inclination (swaying) of the pulley 6, which itself<br>
corresponds substantially to the angle of misalignment Î² of<br>
the hoist rope. The values of L1 and L2 are supplied to an<br>
angular offset calculator 28, which calculates values of<br>
the angle (3 from the relative values of L1 and L2. The<br>
output of this calculator 28 is supplied to a boom strain<br>
evaluation unit 30, which is programmed to output a boom<br>
strain value in response to the angle (3, e.g. from a<br>
mathematical model or look-up tables, taking into account<br>
the forces exerted on the hoist and drag ropes. The boom<br>
strain value is then supplied to the controller (s) 32 for<br>
the drive motor(s) of one or several of the different motor<br>
drives of the dragline. The latter can be the motor drive<br>
for hoist rope 10, the motor drive for the drag rope 18 and<br>
the motor drive for the boom swing. In this way, the motor<br>
drive(s) can perform a real-time feedback control of the<br>
dragline operating parameters to keep the boom stress under<br>
proper control, and optionally record the load values for<br>
servicing purposes. The controller(s) can be programmed to<br>
allow controlled overloads (beyond manufacturer's<br>
prescribed limits) of the dragline structure for maximum<br>
work output, while remaining below the thresholds of<br>
structural damage. The overload can e.g. be controlled to<br>
be temporary. The allowed degree of overload can also take<br>
into account such factors as: whether the dragline is in a<br>
dragging, hoisting or boom swing phase, rope tension values,<br>
the elevation angle of the boom, oscillations in the rope<br>
or boom, wind speed, state of the boom (e.g. whether<br>
repaired) etc. The drive can be controlled in real time in<br>
response to the alignment/misalignment information to adapt<br>
the drive speed or acceleration accordingly, notably by a<br><br>
reduction in acceleration or speed as a function of<br>
load/overload, or to stop the drive.<br>
It will be appreciated that the controller (s) 32 can<br>
also be suitably programmed to control the motor drive<br>
directly in response to the values L1 and L2, i.e. without<br>
recourse to the angular offset calculator 28 and/or boom<br>
strain evaluation unit 30. In the example, the output of<br>
the boom strain evaluation unit 30 is also sent to a man-<br>
machine interface 34. The latter is a personal computer<br>
type of apparatus with a data display screen placed on<br>
board the operator's cabin 2b. The computer comprises<br>
software and firmware modules arranged to process the<br>
output from the boom strain evaluation unit 30 and produce<br>
in real time, in response, a synthesised diagram of the<br>
boom and with a representation of its distortion along a<br>
reference scale, possibly with other data, such as the<br>
estimated stress, load on the ropes, position of the bucket,<br>
duration of the lateral stress, suggested actions, etc. In<br>
addition, or alternatively, the data can sent to an audio<br>
and/or visible alarm, alerting the operator of a lateral<br>
stress beyond a determined threshold.<br>
Figure 6 shows a first variant of the first embodiment,<br>
also based on the pulley mechanism of figure 4, in which<br>
the swaying motion of the pulley 6 is measured by a<br>
rotation sensor 36 having a rotary disk 38. The disk is<br>
provided with encoded indicia 40 readable by an optical<br>
sensor of the rotation sensor 36. The optical sensor can be<br>
implemented using a CCD or an LED, according to known<br>
technology. The rotation sensor 36 delivers a signal<br>
indicating the instant angular position of a reference<br>
point on the disk 38. That point can be set to coincide<br>
with the angular position of the assembly 52, 54 when the<br>
hoist rope 10 when it is aligned with the boom axis BA.<br><br>
The rotary disk 38 of the sensor is joined to the<br>
proximal end 42a of rigid stem 42, whose distal end 42b is<br>
arranged to be resiliently biased firmly against the outer<br>
face of a flange 6a of the pulley 6 to follow its lateral<br>
displacement. The distal end 42b contacts the pulley near<br>
the circumference and at a point vertically above or below<br>
the pulley axle 24 for maximum translational movement for a<br>
given angle of tilt, i.e. sway. Accordingly, the stem 42<br>
causes the rotary disk 38 to turn as a function of pulley's<br>
swaying motion from its central position (the latter is<br>
illustrated in dotted lines). The rotation signal from the<br>
sensor 36 is sent to an angular offset angle detector 44,<br>
similar to offset calculator 28, calibrated to produce an<br>
indication of the misalignment angle Î² in response to the<br>
evolution of rotation sensor output as the pulley tilts.<br>
Preferably, a concentric groove (not shown) is<br>
provided on the side face 6a of the pulley to receive and<br>
guide the distal end 42b of the stem, allowing it to<br>
maintain a fixed radial position with respect to the<br>
pulley's axle 24, while allowing the pulley to rotate<br>
freely.<br>
In the example, stem is generally straight up to the<br>
distal end 42b, at the region of which it has a bend<br>
portion 42c to place the contact point with the pulley<br>
entering from the side. The proximal end 42a of the stem<br>
is laterally displaced from the pulley. This configuration<br>
of the stem and its positioning allows to follow the<br>
swaying motion of the pulley without interfering with the<br>
passage of the rope 10.<br>
Alternatively, the stem 42 can be made to divide into<br>
two branches at the distal end, forming a fork embracing<br>
the pulley with sufficient free space around the sides to<br>
accommodate for its tilting motion as it sways. The free<br><br>
ends of the fork are turned inwardly to contact a<br>
respective outer face of the pulley flanges 6a and 6b,<br>
again preferable near their circumference and above or<br>
below the pulley axle to convert the pulley's swaying or<br>
swinging motion into a substantial angular displacement of<br>
the stem.<br>
Depending on the dragline, the response of the pulley<br>
bearing 22, and its operating conditions, the angle of<br>
deflection determined by the rotation sensor 36 may not<br>
correspond to the actual misalignment angle (3 of the rope.<br>
In this case, an experimentally-determined scaling or<br>
correction factor may be used in the angular offset<br>
detector 44.<br>
Likewise, a similar correction factor can be applied<br>
in the embodiment of figure 5 if the swaying angle of the<br>
tilted pulley does not properly match the hoist rope's<br>
angle of misalignment.<br>
In a further a variant, the rotary sensor and stem can<br>
be replaced by a feeler device, such as a spring loaded<br>
plunger projecting inwardly from the bearing housing and<br>
impinging one of the faces 6a or 6b of the pulley. Each<br>
plunger is associated to a sensor measuring its projection,<br>
corresponding to the distance L1 or L2 (cf. figure 4) to<br>
determine the amount of sway in the pulley, based on the<br>
known value of L1 when there is no sway in the pulley.<br>
This variant can also be implemented with two feeler<br>
devices operating on opposite side faces 6a and 6b of the<br>
pulley, in a manner analogous to the embodiment of figure 5,<br>
so delivering the two distance values L1 and L2.<br>
Conversely, the embodiment of figure 5 could be<br>
implemented with just one sensor device 26a or 26b laser<br>
beam, using the fact that the value of L1/L2 or L2/L1 when<br>
the pulley is unswayed (not deflected) is a known constant.<br><br>
In a second embodiment, the pulley mechanism can also<br>
be used as a point of measurement of lateral stress on the<br>
boom 4 even if it not designed to allow the above-described<br>
swaying motion of the pulley 6 and axle 24. In this case,<br>
the measurement can be effected by means of one or several<br>
strain gauges, as illustrated in figure 7.<br>
As shown in the example of figure 7, strain gauges 46<br>
can be placed on the outer side faces of the flanges 6a, 6b<br>
of the pulley 6 and/or on the pulley axle 24. The gauges<br>
are connected to a calculation unit (not shown) where the<br>
detected distortion is converted to a lateral stress LS<br>
value on the boom. This conversion can be established on<br>
the basis of prestored conversion tables obtained<br>
empirically from test data, or from mathematical modelling.<br>
Figure 8 illustrates schematically a third embodiment<br>
of the invention, in which the alignment/misalignment of<br>
the drag rope 10 is also detected by mechanical means 48.<br>
These comprise a short sleeve 50, or alternatively a ring,<br>
surrounding the drag rope 10, and by which lateral<br>
deflections of the rope are detected by angle sensors. The<br>
sleeve 50 is connected to the underside of the boom 4 by a<br>
mechanical assembly comprising two arms 52, 54 which are<br>
mutually articulated to allow the sleeve 50 to follow the<br>
variations of the rope angle a in the vertical longitudinal<br>
plane as the bucket 8 is dragged (cf. figure 1). The<br>
lengths of the arms 52, 54 are set to allow the sleeve 50<br>
to follow the full amplitude of the evolutions of the angle<br>
Î± of the hoist rope 10, without impeding the movement of<br>
the latter. The arm assembly 52, 54 is rigid in the<br>
lateral direction, i.e. in the direction of lateral stress<br>
LS, and joins to a rotary sensor within a housing 56 fixed<br>
to the boom 4.<br><br>
As shown in figure 9, arm 54 of the assembly is<br>
attached to a rotary sensor disk 38 comprising encoded<br>
indicia 40 readable by an optical sensor device 36,<br>
analogous to the sensor 36 of figure 6, and which can also<br>
be implemented using a CCD or a LED, according to known<br>
technology. The sensor 36 delivers a signal indicating the<br>
instant angular position of a reference point on the disk.<br>
That point can be set to coincide with the angular position<br>
of the assembly 52, 54 when the hoist rope 10 is aligned<br>
with the boom axis BA. The output from the sensor is pre-<br>
processed by an angular offset calculator 28, which<br>
produces the value of the deflection angle (3 of the rope as<br>
the disk 38 is caused to rotate by the arm assembly 52, 54.<br>
The calculator 28 is similar to the one of figure 4<br>
used to express the rope angle (3. This angle value is<br>
inputted to a boom strain evaluation unit 30 which is also<br>
fed with the values of the loads on the ropes 10 and 18 to<br>
produce monitoring and alarm information to a man-machine<br>
interface 34. The latter is substantially the same as in<br>
the first embodiment, producing equivalent PC display data<br>
and audio/visual alarms signals as described above. The<br>
boom strain evaluation unit 30 also delivers signals to one<br>
or several motor drive controls 32 for real time automated<br>
control of the dragline load parameters, as described above,<br>
notably allowing a controlled overload.<br>
To minimise interference with the natural movement of<br>
the rope 10, the inside of the sleeve 50 is equipped with a<br>
set of four rollers 58 whose axes are along respective<br>
sides of a square. The rollers surround the rope 10, and<br>
each one has a concave profile to follow its contour.<br>
In variants of this second embodiment, the rotatior.<br>
angle sensor can be replaced by a linear displacement<br><br>
sensor, with appropriate adaptation of the linkages to the<br>
hoist rope 10, or drag rope 18.<br>
Figure 10 illustrates a fourth embodiment of the:<br>
invention based on an optical laser 60 fixedly mounted on<br>
the distal end 4b of the boom, shown here in a plan view.<br>
The laser 60 is powered to generate a laser beam 62 which<br>
impinges on a target zone 64 provided on the front face 2a<br>
(line I-I) of the base unit 2, where it creates a<br>
detectable beam spot 65. The laser is positionally<br>
referenced so that its beam 62 is aligned to follow the<br>
boom axis BA when the boom is in its normal state, with no<br>
lateral distortion. The beam spot 65 in this case impinges<br>
at a point along a vertical line where the proximal end 4a<br>
of the boom is centred. The vertical position of the spot<br>
depends on the inclination of the boom. Its lateral<br>
position along the target zone 64 depends on a lateral<br>
distortion of the boom 4: as the boom experiences a lateral<br>
stress, its distal end 4b is deflected in the direction of<br>
stress, and the laser 60 fixed at that point is no longer<br>
directing the beam spot 65' on the vertical centreline, as<br>
shown in dotted lines. The displacement SD of the beam<br>
spot 65' from the vertical centreline expresses the amount<br>
of lateral distortion, and provides a sensitive measurement<br>
of that parameter by the virtue of the considerable optical<br>
lever effect.<br>
The target zone 64 is monitored by a video camera 66<br>
mounted on the base unit 2 by means of a forwardly<br>
projecting bracket 68. The raw signal from the camera is<br>
supplied to a video signal processor unit 70 which<br>
emphasises the image of the beam spot 65, 65' . The output<br>
from the processor unit 70 is supplied for display on a<br>
monitor 72 located at the dragline's control cabin 2b,<br>
where it acts as a man-machine interface for monitoring the<br><br>
lateral stress LS on the boom 4. The monitor 72, also<br>
referred to as video monitor, can be a computer monitor<br>
connected to a PC type computer. In this way, it is<br>
amenable to display computer generated data. The<br>
information can be complemented by markings delimiting<br>
limits L on either side of the vertical centreline, beyond<br>
which the flexing of the boom has attained a danger<br>
threshold. These markings can be painted on the part of<br>
the front 2a of the base unit that serves as the target<br>
zone 64, or inserted electronically by the video signal<br>
processor 70. Other markings can be provided in the same<br>
way to indicate e.g. graduations of lateral deflection SD,<br>
possibly in units expressing force or percentages of the<br>
safe working limit. The contents of the display thus<br>
comprise the above reference markings and a real-time<br>
representation of the beam spot 65, 65'.<br>
In this way, the operator OP observing the video<br>
monitor 72 can use this technical information to monitor<br>
the lateral distortion of the boom at any time and derive a<br>
warning of damaging lateral stresses on the boom.<br>
The output of video signal processor 70 is also<br>
applied to a computerised evaluation unit 74 programmed to<br>
detect automatically the position of the beam spot 65, 65'<br>
and react accordingly. The reaction can be a warning<br>
signal detectable by the human operator OP, or a command to<br>
one or several of the motor drive controls 32 already<br>
described, e.g. to reduce or halt the application of the<br>
towing force TF on the drag rope 18 and/or the force SF on<br>
the hoist rope 10, or again the swinging motion of the boom<br>
4.<br>
The evolution of the lateral position of the beam<br>
spot can thus be exploited in an automated or human<br>
feedback control of the dragline's operating conditions,<br><br>
notably of the load applied to the drag rope and/or the<br>
hoist rope, boom swing, as explained above.<br>
Figure 11 illustrates a fifth embodiment of the<br>
invention, also based on optical means, which in this case<br>
serve to monitor the alignment of the hoist rope 10 and<br>
bucket 8. The monitoring is obtained by a video camera 7 6<br>
mounted on the boom 4, with the lens directed to image the<br>
hoist rope 10 suspended from the pulley 6. The camera's<br>
field of view is adjusted against a graticule 78 which<br>
serves as a reference for assessing the rope's lateral<br>
alignment/misalignment. The graticule can be physical<br>
markings 78a on a transparent plate in front of the camera<br>
lens, or it can be inserted electronically. In the example,<br>
the graticule is designed to show a vertical centreline<br>
against which the image 10I of the hoist rope 10 coincides<br>
when in correct lateral alignment, and a set of inclined<br>
lines converging towards the top, associated with indicia<br>
78b to enable the operator OP to assess the degree of rope<br>
lateral misalignment.<br>
The video output of the camera 76 is sent to a video<br>
signal processor 70', similar to processor 70 described<br>
above, but optimised to enhance the visibility of the<br>
rope's image 10I and to insert the graticule 78 when it is<br>
created electronically. The output of the video signal<br>
processor 70' is sent to a video monitor 72 at the<br>
operator's cabin 2b, as in the previous embodiment, where<br>
it displays for the operator OP the rope's image 10I and<br>
graticule 78 (box 79). In this way, the video monitor also<br>
provides a man-machine interface producing technical<br>
information so as to enable the operator to assess the<br>
rope's lateral alignment/misalignment. The video monitor<br>
72 can be the computer monitor associated to a PC as<br><br>
described with reference to the previous embodiments, or<br>
simply a TV monitor.<br>
The video signal processor 70' also extracts and<br>
exploits the pixels of the rope's image 10I to derive<br>
computer exploitable data on the rope's lateral inclination<br>
angle (3. This data is supplied to an evaluation unit 74',<br>
similar to evaluation unit 74 described above, adapted to<br>
use that inclination angle data in conjunction with the<br>
instantaneous load values applied on the drag ropes 10, 18,<br>
supplied as input parameters. In this way, it determines<br>
the lateral stress LS on the boom 4 and acts on the motor<br>
drive control(s) 32 as described above to adjust in real<br>
time the load on the ropes 10, 18 and if needs be the boom<br>
swing dynamics accordingly.<br>
Likewise, the operator OP can exploit the rope<br>
inclination data with his knowledge of the instantaneous<br>
loads applied to the ropes to assess the risk of boom<br>
damage. As in the previous embodiment, the information<br>
from the video signal processor 70' or evaluation unit 74'<br>
can also be used to trigger an alarm signal detectable by<br>
the operator when a certain risk level is detected or to<br>
influence the respective drive motors. In certain cases it<br>
may be beneficial to only show the derived load<br>
characteristics data to the operator.<br>
The camera 76 can be placed at any suitable point<br>
along the length of the boom, based on the following<br>
considerations: the closer it is to the pulley 6, the<br>
closer it will be to the rope 10, and hence the better the<br>
viewing position, while the further it is from the pulley,<br>
the greater the absolute lateral displacement of the rope<br>
for a given misalignment - and hence the easier to detect<br>
that misalignment.<br><br>
In a variant, a camera 80 can be arranged to view the<br>
bucket 8 instead of the rope 10, for instance by being<br>
placed at the front face 2a of the base unit, at a position<br>
in vertical alignment with the proximal end 4a of the boom<br>
4. The video signal processor 70' is then optimised to<br>
analyse the contours of the imaged bucket and thereby<br>
determine the lateral position of its centreline. This<br>
variant has the advantage of placing the camera 80 at a<br>
zone that is relatively more sheltered and stabilised, and<br>
of using a larger object (bucket) as the imaging target,<br>
compensating for the additional viewing distance.<br>
Naturally, it is possible to implement both cameras<br>
76 and 80, and possibly others, so as to provide the<br>
operator OP/evaluation unit with multiple image data for<br>
analysing the operating conditions.<br>
Figures 12a and 12b illustrate another variant in<br>
which a video camera 82 is arranged to provide a plunging<br>
view of drag rope 10. In the example, the camera 82 is<br>
mounted on a bracket 84 projecting from the distal end 4b<br>
of the boom 4. The camera 82 is located forward of the<br>
vertical from the pulley 6 and turned at an angle towards<br>
the ground zone where the bucket 8 operates, so as to<br>
provide a field of view as shown by the broken lines FOV.<br>
The field of view covers both the hoist rope 10 (foreground)<br>
and the drag rope 18 (background), as well as the bucket 8.<br>
The vertical centreline of the camera image 86 coincides<br>
with the vertical projection of the boom axis BA when the<br>
boom is not deformed, and hence also with the lateral<br>
alignment of the drag rope 18 and hoist rope 10 under<br>
correct working conditions (figure 12b). As shown more<br>
particularly in figure 12b, the camera 86 can thereby<br>
detect a lateral misalignment of the hoist rope 10, drag<br>
rope 18 and bucket 8 (representation in dotted lines) . As<br><br>
in the other embodiments, the signal from the camera 82 is<br>
processed as already described with reference to figure 11<br>
to produce the image 86 on the operator's video monitor 72<br>
and/or for exploitation by an evaluation unit 74'<br>
controlling the motor drive control (s) in the manner<br>
described above.<br>
The camera arrangement of figures 12a and 12b can be<br>
implemented in addition to the camera arrangements<br>
described with reference to figure 11, providing a further<br>
source of visual monitoring information and/or computer<br>
data on the alignment conditions.<br>
Figure 13 illustrates a sixth embodiment based on GPS<br>
receivers to detect a lateral distortion of the boom 4<br>
arising from a lateral stress LS. In the example, three<br>
GPS receivers GPS1, GPS2 and GPS3 are positioned along the<br>
longitudinal axis of the dragline containing the boom axis<br>
BA. A first GPS receiver GPS1 is fixed onto base unit 2 of<br>
the dragline, for which it constitutes a fixed reference<br>
point. The other two receivers, GPS2 and GPS3, are fixed<br>
respectively at the proximal and distal ends 4a and 4b of<br>
the boom 4.<br>
The three GPS receivers obtain their coordinate<br>
position data from satellites S1, S2, S3, ... at frequent<br>
intervals, say every second. They send these coordinate<br>
position data by wire or wireless link to a GPS coordinate<br>
comparison unit 88, where they are analysed. The GPS<br>
coordinate comparison unit initially stores the coordinate<br>
position data of the three GPS receivers corresponding to<br>
the current location of the dragline and in a condition<br>
where the boom is not submitted to a lateral stress. The<br>
coordinate data from receivers GPS1 and GPS2, respectively<br>
at the base unit 2 and at the proximal end 4a of the boom,<br>
serve to determine the theoretical orientation of the boom<br><br>
with respect to a fixed coordinate system as the boom axis<br>
BA swings (axis SW, figure 1). From the coordinate data of<br>
receivers GPS1 and GPS2, the comparison unit 88 can thus<br>
determine by extrapolation the three-dimensional<br>
coordinates of any point lying on the boom axis BA, under a<br>
condition of zero lateral stress (theoretical boom axis),<br>
and conversely can verify whether a given three-dimensional<br>
coordinate lies on that axis or not.<br>
In this way, it verifies whether or not the<br>
coordinate data from third receiver GPS3, at the distal end<br>
4b, lies on the theoretical boom axis BA. More<br>
particularly, it assesses, by standard transformation<br>
techniques, the amount lateral deflection of the distal end<br>
4b of the boom from the theoretical boom axis BA, resulting<br>
from a lateral stress LS. By a similar technique, it can<br>
also measure, if needs be, a sag of the boom in the<br>
vertical plane.<br>
The calculated value of the lateral deflection of the<br>
boom is supplied to a boom strain evaluation unit 30 as<br>
described above, which determines the response to take as a<br>
function of the amount of estimated lateral stress, based<br>
on the deflection data, as well as possibly other<br>
parameters, such as the load on the ropes 10, 18, motor<br>
drive parameters, etc.<br>
The response takes the form of a signal or data sent<br>
in adapted form to a man-machine interface 34 of the type<br>
described above.<br>
The boom strain evaluation unit 30 can also be<br>
adapted to supply signals to a feedback loop with the motor<br>
drive control (s) 32 for the hoist rope, drag rope or boom<br>
swing drive(s), as already described.<br>
For enhanced accuracy of the GPS coordinate data, the<br>
GPS coordinate comparison unit 88 may be connected to a<br><br>
nearby land-based GPS correction signal station 92, if<br>
available, e.g. by a radio link 94.<br>
Another approach uses 3 GPS units distributed on the<br>
boom, e.g. one at its proximal end, one in the middle, one<br>
at its distal end, to assess the boom curvature as a<br>
consequence of lateral load forces.<br>
Figure 14 illustrates a seventh embodiment of the<br>
invention in which a lateral deflection of the boom 4<br>
resulting from lateral stress LS is detected by surveying<br>
techniques. The concept uses a surveying device located at<br>
a fixed position with respect to the base unit 2 or the<br>
proximal end 4a, adapted to monitor the azimuthal angle of<br>
the distal end 4b relative a reference axis, suitably the<br>
undeflected boom axis BA.<br>
In the example, this technique is implemented by an<br>
auto-tracking total station 96 fixed on the base unit 2 and<br>
positioned in alignment with the boom axis BA. The total<br>
station 96 is trained on a target 98, such as an optical<br>
prism or mirror, used in surveying. The auto-tracking<br>
function of the total station 96 allows the latter to<br>
follow automatically the movements of the distal end 4b of<br>
the boom and to provide continuous information on the<br>
evolution of its azimuthal angle, which is normalised to<br>
the deflection angle of boom. The deflection angle data is<br>
processed by a boom strain evaluation unit 30, analogous to<br>
the one described e.g. with reference to figure 5, and<br>
which sends signals to the motor drive control(s) 32 and/or<br>
to a man-machine interface 34 as explained above.<br>
Further embodiments of the invention can be<br>
implemented by monitoring the torque on the shaft of the<br>
swing axis SW of the boom structure (of. figure 1) . In<br>
this case, a feedback monitor circuit can be placed in the<br><br>
swing motor drive used for swinging the boom structure.<br>
The monitor circuit can determine the turning moment on the<br>
swing axis SW, e.g. when the bucket 8 is being dragged,<br>
that turning moment resulting from a misalignment of the<br>
suspending and drag ropes 8 and 18. The turning moment can<br>
be evaluated by various techniques, e.g. by measuring the<br>
torque to be applied by the drive motor to compensate for<br>
that moment.<br>
Figure 15 illustrates schematically a real-time<br>
feedback control system 100 suitable for the motor drive of<br>
any one of the hoist rope drive, drag rope drive, or boom<br>
swing drive. This feedback control system, typically in<br>
the form of a servo system, can be applied to any of the<br>
embodiments having been described. It may, for instance,<br>
be functionally integrated with the evaluation unit 74 or<br>
motor drive control 32.<br>
The system takes as input the alignment data acquired<br>
concerning the alignment/misalignment of the boom structure<br>
4, hoist rope 10, drag rope 18 or bucket 8, which is<br>
assimilated to a low frequency measurement. Typically,<br>
that data is delivered in adapted form by the boom strain<br>
evaluation unit 30, or the evaluation unit 74, 38', or the<br>
like. The values of the parameters evaluated, which are<br>
indicative of lateral boom stress or a risk of lateral boom<br>
stress, are submitted to a threshold detector 102, which<br>
assesses whether one or several graded stress limit values<br>
are reached. The output of the threshold detector is<br>
applied to a first mixing input 104a of a signal mixer or<br>
combiner 104 having a second input 104b for accepting<br>
command drive signals from the operator OP. The operator<br>
acts through a command interface taking into account the<br>
alignment data produced on his man-machine interface 34.<br><br>
The output of mixer/combiner 104 produces the motor<br>
drive commands. In this example, the command is a weighted<br>
or equal combination of inputs from both the operator and<br>
an automated analysis of the alignment conditions. The<br>
system can thus allow a manual override to a certain degree,<br>
or e.g. produce automatically an operational stress limit<br>
envelope within which the operator is free to fix the<br>
values. In variants, the mixer 104 can be omitted,<br>
whereby the control is entirely manual, based on the<br>
operator's information produced on the man-machine<br>
interface indicating the acquired alignment/misalignment<br>
conditions, or alternatively entirely automated. In the<br>
latter case, the alignment data is sent directly to the<br>
motor drive (s) 32, if needs be via the threshold detector<br>
32. The latter can be omitted in variant embodiments.<br>
The control means 100 is in a feedback loop, with the<br>
detection of the alignment/misalignment condition feeding<br>
back information in real time to implement the control<br>
performed by the motor drive command. The<br>
alignment/misalignment data can be sampled at a suitable<br>
frequency to ensure a real-time or quasi real time control<br>
of the drive and load conditions.<br>
The implementation of the command system can be based<br>
on any suitable servo control loop using standard<br>
engineering practice.<br>
The operator and/or automated control may be provided<br>
with limit stress values corresponding to maximum boom load<br>
limits, typically standard manufacturers limits. This<br>
maximum load data can be presented in the form of graphical<br>
charts, or indicia on a load indication scale presented on<br>
the man-machine interface, or it can be in the form of<br>
stored machine readable data in look-up tables or a<br>
database.<br><br>
The experience of the human operator allows him to<br>
determine if and when an indicated overload can be<br>
tolerated, for instance in certain phases, or for certain<br>
periods, taking various parameters into account.<br>
For an automated feedback control of drive motors,<br>
the maximum load values can be exploited similarly to<br>
command intelligently an overload under specific programmed<br>
conditions, taking into account other parameters, e.g.<br>
based on fuzzy logic techniques.<br>
In this way, the human operator and/or the automated<br>
feedback control can control the operation of the dragline<br>
with substantially no excessive stress while being under<br>
conditions at - or controllably exceeding - standard<br>
manufacturer's limits for the boom and possibly other<br>
critical components such as the mast 14, stays 16, ropes 10,<br>
18, bucket 8, platform, anchoring points, etc..<br>
It will be appreciated that the above-described<br>
alignment monitoring and human or automated control of the<br>
hoist rope and/or drag rope and/or boomswing drive motor(s),<br>
as a function of that monitoring, can take place at all<br>
times or whenever judged necessary. The above-described<br>
monitoring and human or automated control can be carried<br>
out notably during:<br>
-	a dragging operation for loading the bucket,<br>
-	a hoisting operation for raising or lowering the<br>
bucket,<br>
-	a swinging operation for moving the bucket to a<br>
dumping zone,<br>
-	any other phase of operation of the dragline.<br>
In the example of figure 15, the signals from the<br>
mixer/combiner 104 are used to command respective motor<br>
drive controls 32 for:<br><br>
-	a hoist rope motor 106, which is provided at the<br>
base unit 2 to wind/unwind the hoist rope 10 from the base<br>
unit 2. The command can serve here e.g. to establish the<br>
appropriate wind/unwind speed, acceleration/deceleration,<br>
stoppage of the hoist rope;<br>
-	a drag rope motor 108, which is provided at the base<br>
unit 2 to wind/unwind the drag rope 18 from the base unit 2.<br>
The command can serve here e.g. to establish the<br>
appropriate wind/unwind speed, acceleration/deceleration,<br>
stoppage of the drag rope; and<br>
-	a boom swing motor 110, which is provided at the<br>
base unit 2 to swing the boom 4 laterally e.g. to position<br>
the bucket 8 from a drag zone to a dumping zone, the<br>
swinging being around the swing axis SW at the base unit as<br>
shown in figure 1. The command can serve here e.g. to<br>
establish the appropriate swing speed,<br>
acceleration/deceleration, stoppage of the boom 4, in<br>
either direction.<br>
It also possible to adapt the above-described<br>
embodiments of the invention to analyse the alignment of<br>
the drag rope 18 and/or the bucket 8, instead of or in<br>
addition to the alignment of the hoist rope 10.<br>
Thus, for the embodiment of figure 11, the camera 76,<br>
or an additional camera, may also be arranged to monitor<br>
the alignment of the drag rope 18, e.g. by being placed at<br>
some point along the boom 4 and directed towards the ground,<br>
with a field of view covering the zone occupied by the drag<br>
rope and bucket. The electronic image can be referenced<br>
and processed in the same manner as described for the<br>
camera image 4 6, but to determine the angle subtended by<br>
the drag rope 18 with respect to the boom axis BA.<br>
In a similar manner, in the embodiment of figures 12a<br>
and 12b, the camera 50, or an additional camera, may be<br><br>
arranged at some point along the boom and directed to focus<br>
more particularly on the alignment of the drag rope 18.<br>
Also, the embodiment of figure 9 can be implemented on<br>
the drag rope 18 in addition to, or instead of, being<br>
implemented on the hoist rope. The sleeve 50 would in that<br>
case surround the drag rope 18 at some point between the<br>
bucket 8 and the base unit 2, and be coupled to the rotary<br>
sensor unit 56 by an adapted arm and bracket device.<br>
The measuring/analysing devices (lasers, cameras,<br>
sensors, GPS receivers gauges, etc.) and the functional<br>
hardware and software units described in the above<br>
embodiments can be powered by any suitable means (power<br>
cable, battery pack, solar cells, etc.), and can likewise<br>
communicate by any suitable means (wire data link, optical<br>
data transmission, radio link, wireless communications<br>
protocol (WiFi, Bluetooth, ...) , etc.).<br>
From the foregoing, it will be understood that the<br>
invention can implemented in numerous ways and with<br>
numerous techniques, e.g. laser and optical lever,<br>
electronic image acquisition, telemetry by radio signals,<br>
such as GPS receivers, mechanical sensing on the rope<br>
and/or pulley, surveying, etc.<br>
The measurements can be of the actual lateral<br>
distortion of the boom, the stresses applied to the boom<br>
and their lateral force component, or the angle of<br>
misalignment of the hoist and/or drag rope(s) with respect<br>
to vertical projection of the boom axis, etc.<br>
It will be apparent that the different embodiments<br>
described accommodate for transpositions of means and/or<br>
techniques from one embodiment to other. Also, a number<br>
different embodiments can be implemented together in a<br>
dragline or electric shovel to provide respective<br>
complementary sources of alignment data.<br><br>
Also, the hardware and software aspects of<br>
embodiments can be implemented in many different equivalent<br>
forms in addition to those described in the examples.<br><br>
