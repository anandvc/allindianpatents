				<td>A SYSTEM AND A METHOD FOR GIVING NOTICE OF THE STATUS OF A<br>
PLURALITY OF CONTAINERS<br>
The present invention relates to a system and a method of giving notice of the<br>
status of a plurality of containers.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1. Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to the general method of updating the delivery/stock status<br>
of mailboxes, shelves, sorter bins, and a plurality of bins located at Post Offices,<br>
Companies or shelf space at supermarkets, department stores, and reporting to the<br>
respective owners, recipients and/or vendors of these boxes via email, pager, PDA,<br>
cellular phone message system, website mailboxes and voice mail at a call center. The<br>
invention can be implemented at the Post Office mailboxes, company mailboxes,<br>
apartment mailboxes, store shelves at supermarkets, department stores, etc. The<br>
update information is to alert the recipient via email, pager or voice mail when any mails<br>
or articles are delivered to their mailboxes currently or when the shelves with certain<br>
items are empty or close to empty and need inventory replenishment and management.<br>
2. Discussion of the Prior Art<br>
Previous devices involve the use of mechanical trigger mechanisms to the doors<br>
and hinges of mailboxes. The device described in U.S. Patent 4,262,839 involves a<br>
mechanical visible indicator to show the delivery status. Such devices will not be able to<br>
provide remote delivery status far from the mailbox site and do not address the case of<br>
thousands of mailboxes with their recipients' locations remote and dispersed all over the<br>
world. Another example of this type of device including a magnet is described in U.S.<br>
Patent 6,155,482. A drawback of these type of door trigger mechanism is that while<br>
they indicate that a door has been opened, this does not imply actual mail delivery.<br>
A device described in U.S. Patent No. 5,427,282 uses an audible or visual signal<br>
to indicate the delivery. It is achieved by using a control box that has a DC circuit<br>
activated by the delivery site which in turn controls an AC circuit which allows a<br>
receptacle to turn on its power. This electrical receptacle can power an electric<br>
appliance to signal the recipient. This system does not signal outside of the immediate<br>
area.<br>
In the reproduction industry, multiple copies of printed sheets are<br>
sorted into bins for job separation. They are fitted with an integral<br>
optical transmitter/receivers unit to distinguish which of the bins are still<br>
empty and available in response to the respective electrical bin empty signals. This<br>
is described in U.S. Pat. 5,328,169. Because printer sorters are designed to handle paper, they cannot<br>
be used with arbitrarily shaped packages, objects, or fluids. Nor are printer sorters capable of<br>
handling thousands of bins at once. Such demands are not faced by the copy reproduction industries.<br>
In the peripheral equipment industry, equipment requires monitoring and maintenance. The<br>
equipment may be a PBX or ACD, and there is an interface device that converts the output from the<br>
equipment to email messages so that a technician at a remote site can be informed. This type of<br>
interface device and an email interpreter are described in U.S. Pat. 6,003,070. This costly interface<br>
email device has to be present at every piece of equipment that requires monitoring. Its design would<br>
not be suitable to the monitoring of thousands of simple bins. Thus, it is limited in the total number<br>
of bins.<br>
In the arena of managing delivery of goods U.S. Pat 6,085,170 describes a system that is<br>
designed for supporting delivery of purchased goods or commodities from a distribution center to the<br>
purchaser. This system tracks deliveries by way of bar code or smart card requiring the production of<br>
a special marker.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to the method of information updating the many diverse clients the<br>
status of the delivery and/or quantifying the articles located in a site with many<br>
mailboxes/bins/containers. This is performed through the use of sensors, flexible circuit boards,<br>
distributed microcontrollers capable of scanning the sensor information and reporting its status<br>
through a common bus and identifying its electronic address, and sending this information to a<br>
master controller which directly collects all information and serially updates a computer system. In<br>
turn, this computer system has relational database containing email address, pager address, personal<br>
digital assistant address (PDA), cellular phone address, call center addresses, preferably web sites or<br>
the like, such that the client can use the information for a pick up or determine an order to be placed<br>
for inventory management.<br>
The scanning of information is performed at a regular or preset rate or activated upon<br>
delivery and allows an accurate report on the status of these mailboxes/bins/containers located<br>
remotely, and their unrelated customers or vendors distributed over vastly dispersed geographical<br>
locations and time zones. These customers/vendors can also be mobile while information is updated.<br>
This also has the capability of frequently reprogramming the report information, customer list, or<br>
locations from another remote facility. Customers can also call to a call center with its Personal<br>
Identification Number (PIN) or other forms of authentication to retrieve a voice mail of the status.<br>
In the scenario of an inventory management system, this reporting can be tied to the vendor<br>
that supplies the merchandise and update the status of the supplier's inventory system to initiate<br>
delivery.<br>
Therefore its ability to report and reprogram from a remote facility allows the system to be<br>
maintained, reroute the information reliably, and keep its function versatile.<br>
The invention includes notifying recipients of objects in mailboxes, bins and shelves by a<br>
system that preferably includes a sensor, a flexible circuit board, a mailbox address identifier, an<br>
embedded subsystem data collection center, a computing device with wireless modem or cable<br>
modem and a database containing email addresses, pager addresses, phone mail addresses, website<br>
URLs, Call Center database and a program to direct the delivery status to these locations. The<br>
notification may be in broadcast mode. This enables multiple recipients to receive the delivery status<br>
simultaneously without addition cost.<br>
A preferred embodiment of the claimed invention may be used to with a plurality of vending<br>
machines. In such an embodiment, the vending machines preferably provide notification of their<br>
inventory status, including whether restocking is required.<br>
The mailboxes, bins, and shelves may be spaces where item is stored temporarily or<br>
permanently having no innate active signaling capability of its own content. The sensors provide<br>
active identification of letters, parcels, merchandise and objects of various shapes, sizes and<br>
materials.<br>
An embedded system data collection device receives signals from the sensors and relays the<br>
signals to a central processor. The data collection device may be a microcontroller based device that<br>
reads a corresponding delivery state from each bin and sends a detailed combined state report to a<br>
central computing device with a standard protocol including bin address information. The. serial<br>
RS232, RS485, Universal Serial Bus (USB), and IEEE-1394 Firewire busses are useful for the final<br>
stage reporting from the aggregate processor to a computer such as a personal computer, single board<br>
computer, or embedded processor. The aggregate processor can be a CAN processor having both<br>
CAN bus and RS232/RS485/USB/1EEE-1394 Firewire bus on the same micro-controller. The USB<br>
and IEEE-1394 firewire are preferable, as they can transfer high speed data as fast as 12Mbits/s and<br>
400 Mbits/s respectively, but any of the busses mentioned herein are allowable.<br>
The computing device may include a wireless modem or cable modem. The computer may be<br>
a personal computer or embedded microcontroller system with sufficient memory to store and run an<br>
application program capable of sending email, voice mail, and pager mail. In the cases of email or<br>
two-way pagers, a choice of acknowledgement can be done. This will confirm that recipient has<br>
acknowledged and the date stamp is in place.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment, a system for notifying of the presence or absence of an<br>
object or fluid is presented. The system includes a plurality of containers and a plurality of sensor<br>

According to another preferred embodiment of the present invention, a method for notifying<br>
of the presence or absence of an object or fluid is presented. A container configured to hold an object<br>
or a fluid is presented. A sensor unit associated with the container senses the presence or absence of<br>
an object or fluid. In response to said sensing, a first signal is forwarded to a microcontroller<br>
connected to the sensor unit. In response to the first signal, a second signal is sent from the<br>
microcontroller to a computer. An alert in response to the second signal is provided, where the alert<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENT<br>
The scope of the invention is defined by claims at the conclusion of this detailed description<br>
of the preferred embodiments. However, the organization, operation, advantages and objects of the<br>
invention can be more fully appreciated from the following description.<br>
1) System Components<br>

relationship:<br>

Figure 1 depicts a block diagram of a preferred embodiment.<br>
2) Sensors Assembly<br>
Sensors that can be used in the mailbox/bin/container assembly can be any of the following types: -<br>
i) Light or Optical Sensor,<br>
ii) Pressure or weight Sensor,<br>
iii) Capacitance Sensor,<br>
iv) Magnetic and/or Hall effect Sensor,<br>
v) Float Sensor,<br>
vi) Heat/temperature sensor<br>
vii) Motion sensor<br>
viii) Acoustic sensor<br>
ix) Any combination of the above sensors.<br>
The choice of sensors depends on the functional requirement of the system. In the mailbox<br>
delivery notification system, the two common sensors used are Optical and weight sensors. However,<br>
in an inventory notification system, any type of appropriate sensors may be used depending on what<br>
kind of inventory is being stored. The use of several sensors placed at different locations in the<br>
mailbox/bin allows objects with different sizes and shapes to be detected. The use of Polymer Thick<br>
Film Technology as a pressure and weight sensor allows quantification of the weight and count for<br>
the article stored in the mailbox or bin. The use of a capacitance sensor allows determination the<br>
material stored through its dielectric properties. The use of magnetic and/or hall-effect sensors<br>
quantifies ferromagnetic materials. And the use of float sensors allows determination of liquid<br>
quantity.<br>
Figure 2 Illustrates a cross section of a preferred embodiment having a mailbox 27 with an<br>
assembly 21 in the clip form of a distributed microcontroller with flexible circuit connector 25 with<br>
several flexible circuits 22 with optical detectors 24 and LEDs 23.<br>
3) Flexible Circuit Board Assembly<br>
The sensors are preferably mounted on a flexible circuit board. Figure 3 illustrates a preferred<br>
embodiment of a flexible circuit 31 made of copper Kapton, or Polymer Thick Film (PTF) Ink 32 on<br>
Mylar 34 or other substrate films mounted with a resistor 35 an active LED 36 (sensor) and an<br>
optical detector 33 (sensor). A flexible sensor circuit comprises a low profile copper flexible circuit<br>
or Polymer Thick Film (PTF) flexible circuit (Figure 3) mounted with a single sensor or multiple<br>
sensors for the purpose of attachment to the inner surface of the Mailbox (Figure 2). The use of<br>
flexible circuit boards allows the sensors to be mounted and attached to the contour of the<br>
mailbox/bin walls or shelves by adhesive. Such flexible circuit boards are very thin and flat, and are<br>
not obstructions to the article to be placed in the mailbox/bin. As a flexible circuit can adapt to any<br>
contour, it can attach to the walls or embedded in the mailbox structure of any shape or sizes for<br>
optimal mail/article detection. The flexible circuit board may comprise conductive traces or wires on<br>
a flexible insulating substrate such Kapton, Mylar, Paper and any combination thereof. The polymer<br>
thick film (PTF) flexible circuit board may employ conductive ink as the conductive traces, such as<br>
silver ink, carbon ink, or conductive polymer based inks; but the types of traces or wires are not<br>
limited by these examples. The flexible circuit performs the function of housing the sensor and is<br>
strategically located on the mailbox/bin/container to perform a detection of articles and quantify their<br>
presence without obstructing existing space.<br>
The flexible circuit board may have an added bus for memory devices such as a flash<br>
EPROM to reside. This memory device stores an address for use in identifying the sensor attached<br>
and consequently the location of the mailbox/bin. The flash EPROM also allows the address to be<br>
redefined, allowing the flexibility of programming the custom address at the mailbox/bin site.<br>
The method of knowing whether there is mail or article is present is via the placement of the<br>
sensors such that the article obstructs an optical path. For example an optical path can be constructed<br>
from a Light Emitting Diode (LED) and a light detector. A LED will emit light when an appropriate<br>
voltage is supplied matching its polarity. A light detector is a device that generates a voltage when<br>
the light of the right wavelength shines on it. A current limiting resistor is normally connected in<br>
series with the LED. This voltage would be controlled by the microcontroller described in the next<br>
section. It also can drive the LEDs to light up as a series of flashes or pulses for coding purposes.<br>
When the LED flashes a sequence of pulses and the light detector can obtain the same sequence of<br>
pulses then there are no opaque objects in between. In the particular case of the mailbox, then there is<br>
no mail or parcel placed in the optical path. However, if a letter or parcel, which is opaque, is placed<br>
in the optical path, the detector will not receive the expected pulses. This confirms a delivery is made<br>
to the mailbox/bin/container.<br>
The LEDs and light detectors are placed at several locations to capture the various standards<br>
of mail articles. Several LEDs located at different location (Figure 1) of the mailbox/bin are scanned<br>
sequentially to provide different light angle projection to a detector to pick up various mail article<br>
sizes.<br>
For supermarket shelves, the blockage of the light path indicates the present of the remaining<br>
stock. A shortfall in stock will alert the purchasing department to stock up its shelves.<br>
The use of different types of sensors like pressure, capacitance and Hall effect devices allow<br>
different types of physical quantities to be detected. For example, a pressure sensor can be a weight<br>
sensor, it acts like a scale to determine the quantity of items present if each item weight is known,<br>
including individual items, or groups of like items in contained crates. A low cost Polymer Thick<br>
Film (PTF) circuit made out of PTF carbon/conductive polymer or other conductive ink can be used<br>
a pressure as well as a weight sensor. This flexible circuit when flexed and/or compressed under a<br>
weight, changes its PTF ink resistance values dramatically. It can be deployed as a weight sensor for<br>
quantifying the article/articles weight placed in the mailbox/bin. In such cases the PTF resistances<br>
are first calibrated by using a circuit resistance divider to voltage detection circuit as shown in Figure<br>
4. Figure 4 illustrates a weight /pressure sensing using PTF conductive ink technology and its circuit<br>
implementation. The output voltage, Vo, is given by the resistance ratio, R1/(R0+R1) multiplied by<br>
the reference voltage, Vref supplied by the microcontroller. The PTF Ink weight-sensing resistor has<br>
resistance value similar to the fixed surface mount resistor, RO. Under a compression force, the PTF<br>
resistance can drop significantly, thereby giving the weight of the article placed on it.<br>
Since the custom printed PTF Ink weight sensor can cover the entire bottom surface of the<br>
mailbox/bin, the placement of any article with weight will be detected. This will normally distinguish<br>
a parcel from a regular mail. In the inventory management case where each bin contains only one<br>
type of article, this weight sensor is used to count the number of same articles in the bin if the weight<br>
of one article is known. The individual article weight is pre-stored in the relational database.<br>
A capacitance sensor can distinguish different dielectric materials and therefore can identify<br>
the type of article material placed in the mailbox/bin. There are many types of capacitive sensors.<br>
Some are based on Field Effect Transistors structures (FETs) where the gate voltage is very much<br>
influenced by the dielectric material. These FETs can be made of semiconductor materials such as<br>
silicon or conductive polymer material.<br>
A hall-effect sensor can be used as both a weight sensor and a ferromagnetic material sensor.<br>
An opaque inert floating object can be used as an obstruction to an optical path. Then an<br>
optical detection system such as LEDs and optical diodes can be mounted on the outer wall of the bin<br>
if it is made out of a clear material like glass or clear polymer. If the opaque-floating object has a<br>
mirror like surface, angle of reflection between LED, float mirror and the optical diode pair can be<br>
used to quantify the liquid volume. This is used for measuring liquid volume if the bin or container<br>
geometry is well defined. Other float measuring devices using radio frequency and/or Doppler effect<br>
are alternative methods to liquid volume measurement can be used for inventory keeping. Such<br>
liquid measurement may be used for applications in gasoline reserves at a filling station or medicines<br>
at a pharmacy, but are not limited to such applications.<br>
4.) Distributed Microcontrollers with Master Controller<br>
The flexible circuits with sensors are connected to the input/output port of a distributed<br>
microcontroller (MCU). The input port can also be either an analog or digital. An analog input port<br>
can read in voltage and convert it to a discretized digital value (such as 8 bits/10 bits). A digital input<br>
port will register either a " 1" or "0" depending on the voltage input. An output port will source either<br>
a " 1" or "0" voltage output to drive an LED or other devices. The master controller may be included<br>
in one of the distributed microcontrollers, or may be a separate device. The microcontroller performs<br>
several functions. The functions are:<br>
a) To initiate sensing by sending voltage pulses to light up the LEDs. This initiation is<br>
performed under a preferred condition, e.g., it receives a call from the master controller when its<br>
address is called upon, it can initiate by itself after a preset time, or a signal change from the sensor<br>
wakes up the microcontroller. This sensor can be other than the optical sensor.<br>
b) A report of the current sensor's state is sent together with a unique address to the common bus<br>
periodically or upon initiation. The unique address allows the service to distinguish the specific<br>
status is from an aggregate of mailboxes/bins. The unique address depends very much on the bus<br>
protocol.<br>
c) On the other hand to conserve energy, the distributed MCU goes into a sleep mode but<br>
periodically checks the sensor. As soon as a mail or article is inserted in the box, the sensor signal<br>
level changes and wakes up the MCU. The MCU sends a signal to the master controller. The master<br>
controller acknowledges and then goes through the cycle of information collection.<br>
5.) Common Bus Architecture and Addressing scheme<br>
The Common Bus Architecture is used with the distributed microcontrollers because it is the<br>
information highway network for them to communicate all information. There must also be a bus<br>
network protocol that allows information to be distributed in a systematic manner without collision,<br>
or loss of information. The electronic bus is used to allow distributed microcontrollers located near<br>
the location of the mailboxes to report their status with other microcontrollers that can be located far<br>
apart from each other. At the same time they are capable of communicating with each other, having<br>
electronic addresses for messages. The microcontrollers identify the flexible circuit sensors<br>
connected to the particular microcontroller.<br>
In this system, there are aggregate of mailboxes or bins that are usually identified uniquely.<br>
The system typically uses an electronic address identifier for each mailbox or bin. Each mailbox/bin<br>
is equipped with one or more sensors reporting its occupancy together with an address identifier.<br>
This requires the use one of the selected technologies for the group of devices capable of providing a<br>
network bus protocol and a unique identifier scheme.<br>
The bus itself can be in the form of another flexible circuit or multi-wire cable connecting to<br>
the several low-power embedded processors through polling schemes by the Master processor. This<br>
bus is not limited to Controller Area Network (CAN), TCP/IP, or Inter-Integrated Circuit (I2C). This<br>
bus carries both power and signals to and from each distributed microcontroller and with minimal<br>
number of insulated conductor lines. Using low profile small cross-section busses, it makes it easier<br>
to mount to the edge of the mailboxes with little obstruction and yet retain aesthetic values.<br>
Other bus possibilities include wireless transmission using smart card, bluetooth, 802.11 and<br>
telephone two-wire technology. However, the demand on the processor to have added radio<br>
frequency and other modulation/demodulation complicates processor electronics and raises cost.<br>
The tight spaces between the mailboxes/bins demand the use of such network bus. The ideal<br>
bus characteristics are: a shared common bus with as few conductor lines as possible, preferably<br>
serial and capable of direct connection with thousands of similar electronic devices.<br>
Serial mode addressing is preferred, as it requires only few address lines to access thousands<br>
of slave processors, however, any bus system may be used. A polling technique is preferred. First the<br>
computer checks the relational database for mailbox addresses to update. The computer sends a slave<br>
address to the master controller. In turn, the master controller wakes up the distributed<br>
microcontroller. The distributed microcontroller acknowledges the call and replies the master<br>
controller.<br>
A following instruction is sent to initiate sensor measurement and the microcontroller reads<br>
the sensors' result. A sensor status report is then sent to the master controller. The master controller<br>
acknowledges it and then sends the distributed microcontroller back to sleep. Several reports are<br>
collected and sent to the computer.<br>
There will be at least one or more microcontroller reporting the aggregate of all the<br>
mailboxes/bins status to a computer such as a personal computer, single board computer, or<br>
embedded processor. The computer has an associated database and is capable of sending<br>
email/voice/pager mail to call center. That controller reporting to the computer/single board<br>
computer/embedded processor is referred to here as the aggregate or master controller. Such a<br>
system can be achieved from deploying the following bus architecture but not limited to the list:<br>
a) Controller Area Network (CAN) is an advanced serial bus system that efficiently supports<br>
distributed control systems such as micro-controllers, sensors and actuators. This serial bus is<br>
preferably constructed out of two-wire circuit namely, a CAN-H line and a CAN-L line, which can<br>
either be screened or unscreened. Standard CAN version 2.0B protocol has an 11-bit identifier<br>
capable of handling 2048 unique addresses. An extended CAN protocol uses a 29-bit identifier and<br>
therefore can handle up to 536,870,912 unique addresses. When a CAN processor with its<br>
input/output port connected to the sensors through the flexible circuits, which are physically attached<br>
to the mailboxes/bins, the extensive CAN message ID scheme can be deployed to identify each of<br>
the mailboxes/bins. Furthermore, a sub-address scheme can be added uniquely identifying each of<br>
input/output allowing one CAN processor to service several mailboxes/bins. Such bus architecture<br>
increases the capacity to handle several thousand processors as oppose to the limited addressing<br>
scheme in Inter-Integrated Circuit (12C). In addition, this bus architecture can achieve a transmission<br>
rate of 1Mbit/s rate, fast enough to handle all CAN processors in the network spaced up to 40 meters<br>
(130 feet) apart. For longer distances, the data rate can be reduced: for distances up to 500 meters<br>
(1,625 feet) a speed of 125 kbits/s is possible, and for transmissions up to 1 kilometer a data rate of<br>
50 kbits/s is permitted. Therefore this superior capability and versatility allows thousands of CAN<br>
processors attached to mailboxes/bins to communicate even when they are physically very far apart.<br>
CAN is a very reliable network which provides both sophisticated error-detection and error handling<br>
mechanisms, and high immunity against electromagnetic interference. The cost/performance ratio is<br>
also ideal for this application.<br>
The C505C 8-bit MCU family from Infineon Technologies has Analog/Digital Input/Outputs<br>
and complete CAN capability is a suitable candidate for this application. The<br>
MCP2502X/MCP2505X family of devices from Microchip is another suitable candidate. Other CAN<br>
devices are available from many different manufacturers such as Infineon Technologies, Intel,<br>
Philips, Microchip, Motorola, National, SGS Thomson, NEC, Fujitsu, Texas Instruments, Bosch,<br>
Temic, Unitrode, Mietec, and etc. All these CAN MCU can be used to in a mixed mode provided the<br>
same protocol is observed.<br>
b) The Inter Integrated Circuit (I2C) bus architecture also allows several microcontrollers<br>
(MCU) to be connected on the same bus. In its fast mode, it can handle bit rate up to 400 kbits/s. A<br>
standard 7-bit addressing mode allows 128 slave addresses and an extended I2C bus has a 10-bit<br>
addressing mode givingl024 slave addresses. As opposed to the CAN bus, I2C is a multi-<br>
master/multi-slave network interface with collision detection, allowing more than one device<br>
controlling it. Each node on the bus may initiate a message and then transmit or receive data. The<br>
Serial Data Line (SDA) and the Serial Clock Line (SCL) are the two network lines. Each node on the<br>
network has a unique address that accompanies any message passed between nodes.<br>
A master can poll each of the slave processors where each slave MCU is assigned to each<br>
mailbox/bin via the sensor enabled flexible circuit attached to its input/output port. Therefore the<br>
address of the bin is identified through its unique slave address and the specific I/O port. The status<br>
of each bin will then be reported to the master processor. The master processor after resolving the<br>
slave and sub bin address will assign a unique address to each bin-status report and sent to the<br>
Personal Computer. Although the 10-bit addressing allows a thousand unique addresses, the bus<br>
cannot physically support a thousand devices connected to it. Furthermore, long bus lengths are not<br>
possible with I2C. Such bus deployment has a limit on number of mailboxes/bins attached to it. To<br>
overcome this limitation, the invention employs either a bus repeater or a combination with another<br>
bus architecture.<br>
An example of MCU of this class is the PIC16C717 from Microchip. Other manufacturers<br>
include Philips, Intel, Motorola, National, Hitachi, NEC, Ipsil etc.<br>
c) A TCP/IP controller device that decodes an Internet Protocol (IP) address only activates the<br>
sensor when it matches the IP address on the signal line and returns the delivery state of the<br>
mailbox/bin. These are Internet enabled devices and can have large number of nodes on the network.<br>
These TCP Controller-on-a-Chip devices form a low-cost Local Area Network and do perform the<br>
required bus function, but it is more costly and complex than CAN/I2C Network solutions. The use<br>
of low cost TCP/IP address devices allows sensors to use Internet Protocol methods to communicate<br>
and associate the sensor location and address electronically. The sensor would be active when the IP<br>
address called upon matches its device IP address. Examples of TCP/IP controller device are<br>
IPu7931Z/IPu8931Z Controller from Ipsil and S-7600A iChips from Seiko Instruments.<br>
d) Other networks which may be used for the bus include, AS-I, ARCNET, BATIBUS,<br>
BITBUS, EIB, INTERBUS-S, LON, MODBUS, PNET, PROFIBUS, SERCOS, VAN, WORLDFIP.<br>
Some surface mount address devices such as a flash EPROM or Electrically Erasable<br>
Programmable Read Only Memory (EEPROM), which can be attached on the flexible circuit, so that<br>
the circuit itself has a unique address. This software address can be programmed in and read by the<br>
microcontroller. This allows an address attached to the data sent by the sensor and in turn, received<br>
by master controller to identify its status and as well as its source address.<br>
e) An electronic address identifier for each mailbox or location can be performed by a Dual-In-<br>
Line Package (DIP) switch, with the flexible circuit attached to it. This is known as hardware<br>
addressing. The address is set by using the position settings of the DIP-switch. This can be a sub<br>
address (i.e. address extension to the main microcontroller address).<br>
f) Combinations of the above address methods may also be used for a hybrid system. Some<br>
devices have two or more types of busses available and therefore allow hybrid bus architecture. For<br>
example, an I2C bus may be combined with a CAN bus or an 12C bus may be combined with<br>
TCP/IP. Two busses of the same type may also be used. The choice of using PIC 16C717 with 12C<br>
bus for the distributed microcontrollers and the use of P1C18F248 for the bridge to transfer data from<br>
an I2C bus to.a CAN bus is cost effective and efficient. The PIC18F248 is a new chip that has both<br>
I2C and CAN bus architecture on the same chip. Ideally, there will be one master PIC18F248 for<br>
linking the CAN bus to the UART for a RS232 interface with the computer. Preferably, the invention<br>
uses a slower more energy efficient bus architecture amongst the distributed controllers and a faster<br>
bus architecture from the master controller and the computer. However, different hybrid designs may<br>
be used.<br>
A two tiered bus where both busses are CAN may be used in a preferred embodiment as<br>
depicted in FIG. 5. The level 1 CAN MCU can be Microchip MCP25055 (MCP2505X Family),<br>
PIC18F248 (PIC18FXX8 Family) or Infineon Technologies C505 microcontrollers, but is not limited<br>
to these embodiments. One advantage of the two bus scheme is that it allows two different clock<br>
speeds for each level bus. The level 1 distributed MCU can be very slow, with many level 1 MCUs<br>
to one level 2 MCUs. The slow bus saves power and MCU can be in sleep mode when not sensing.<br>
 The ratio of 64 level 1 MCUs to 1 level 2 MCU is possible for practical purposes so long as the CAN<br>
transceiver chip can support it, but this invention contemplates using alternate ratios that the<br>
technology can support. An example of a transceiver chip is 82C250. Level 2 MCU may ideally be a<br>
Twin CAN processor, but may be other processors. This chip can be an Infineon Technology<br>
82C900 MCU, but is not limited to this device. Other two-tiered busses may have alternate<br>
configurations.<br>
An alternate bus system is a hybrid two-bus system with a different bus type for each level,<br>
namely, I2C for level 1 and CAN for level 2. Figure 6 illustrates such a preferred embodiment<br>
having a hybrid bus with one I2C bus and one CAN bus. The level 1 I2C MCU can be Microchip<br>
P1C16C717 (PIC16C71X family). The chip PIC16C717 has a particular advantage of a 37kHz<br>
internal clock for low external component count in its usage. At this speed, the I2C bus is still<br>
sufficient to collect all the required data. One advantage of this two bus scheme is that a different<br>
clock speed may be employed for each bus level. The level 1 distributed MCU can be very slow and<br>
there are many level 1 MCUs to one level 2 MCU. The slow bus saves power and MCU can be in<br>
sleep mode when not sensing. This enables the bus wire diameter to be preferably smaller and the<br>
reporting by each level 1 MCU reported sequentially. The ratio of 25 level 1 MCUs to 1 level 2<br>
MCU is possible for practical purposes. Level 2 MCU is a bridge I2C/CAN processor. This chip can<br>
be a PIC Chip PIC18F248 (PIC18FXX8 Family). The Master Level 2 Bridge MCU can be also a PIC<br>
Chip PIC18F248 (PIC18FXX8 Family) for sending the aggregate information received from CAN<br>
bus to RS232/RS485. The level 2 bus can have a speed of one megahertz, but other speeds are<br>
possible.<br>
In one preferable embodiment, the MCU includes an internal clock, which beneficially<br>
reduces the number of external components and also reduces the required space. However, MCUs<br>
with external clocks may also be used.<br>
6.) Computer System as an Application Server<br>
A computer or embedded computer system will serve as an application server with the<br>
following capabilities:<br>
i) An operating system with real time clock and date keeping,<br>
ii) A database storing recipient email, pager addresses, web addresses, call center addresses,<br>
PDA addresses, cellular phone addresses and the address of each mailbox,<br>
iii) A communication port, wired modem or wireless connection,<br>
iv) Automatic dial-up capability to an ISP server or a wireless server,<br>
v) Email sending software capability,<br>
vi) Pager/PDA sending software capability,<br>
vii) Updating voice mail at the Call Center,<br>
viii) SMS messaging to update status to cellular phone,<br>
ix) Web message center to update delivery status,<br>
x) A firewall to protect against intrusion,<br>
xi) An authentication scheme to access any relational database,<br>
xii) An encryption scheme to secure stored information,<br>
The computer system typically has a RS232/USB/1EEE1394 Firewire port capable of fast<br>
serial communication with the master controller. The computer of the class Pentium III and above<br>
with 256Mb RAM and running on a secure operating system with multitasking capability such as<br>
Windows NT/2000 is one suitable option to serve as an application server. A relational database<br>
program such as SQL Server 7/2000 to store the recipient's contact address can be running on the<br>
background. Another custom application program is also running in the background for lookup and<br>
maintains the database. This program will respond to the data transfer from the serial port and update<br>
the delivery or inventory status in the database. This program is an event driven application. Several<br>
dynamic link libraries (dlls) are created in C or another language for the program to initialize<br>
handshaking, send email, retrieve email and report status of deliveries after transmitted. At the same<br>
time, it will follow the rules stored in the database to decide which information to dispatch to the<br>
recipients. A fast connection by T1/T3/DSL through an ISP will send the required email/voice<br>
mail/pager/web mail to the Network Operation Center (NOC) (Figure 1). A secure network with<br>
encryption is deployed.<br>
Virtual Private Network (VPN) may be used for maintaining the computer system to update<br>
the rules from a remote operation center. This remote operating center can update all different<br>
computers located nationwide.<br>
7.) The Relational Database<br>
The relational database preferably contains fields of mailbox digital addresses and a relation<br>
description to the fields containing target addresses such as email addresses, pager addresses, web<br>
address (URL), phone numbers where the information of the status can be delivered. The relation<br>
description can be classified into one-to-one, one-to-many or many-to-one. The message information<br>
about the status of the mailbox or bins or shelves will be delivered to the target addresses with a time<br>
stamp and location address. This enables the owners, clients and/or vendors to know when the status<br>
check has taken place and also its exact location for decision-making. In the case of the phone<br>
number, it can be a voice mail or a number where the voice mail is stored. If the owner or vendor<br>
needs to find out the status, they can retrieve its voice mail by entering a code for security purposes.<br>
This is the same if the message is retrieved from a web site address.<br>
In general, the relational database includes rules for reporting. A rule-based system for<br>
reporting via email is preferable, but any rule based reporting system may be used. The rules may<br>
specify when, how, and with what frequency the system sends reports via email, pager, cellular<br>
telephone, PDA, or voice mail. An additional optional field containing the type of reporting and<br>
frequency of reporting allows information to be dispatched to the target addresses upon a triggered<br>
status update or scheduled update once a day or multiple updates per day or week according to<br>
schedule frequency. The scanning of addresses without replies will lookup the email or pager address<br>
corresponding.to the scanning address in the database. If there are no email messages sent out for a<br>
predetermined time interval, it initiates the automatic email or pager calling function and opens the<br>
communication port to send a notification by email or pager. The predetermined time interval is<br>
typically a day, but can vary from minutes to weeks. The period may also be random.<br>
An optional field is provided to the record the success of the delivery of the status. This<br>
enables the client to know when the information was last retrieved.<br>
The relational database can be tables written in any one of the database software Microsoft<br>
Access, Microsoft SQL Server, db2, Oracle, etc.<br>
8.) Communication with a wireless nationwide networks provider through a Network Operation<br>
Center (NOC), a Call Center (CC) and Internet Service Provider (ISP) with web server.<br>
The dispatching of delivery status or inventory status is carried out in one of the following<br>
ways:<br>
a) A connection such as a fast Tl /T3/DSL to an Internet Service Provider (ISP),<br>
b) A connection to a Network Operation Center (NOC) like Skytel,<br>
c) A satellite link as a backup to the NOC,<br>
d) The NOC will send the messages according to each recipient's address, some are pagers,<br>
some are emails,<br>
e) A link to a Call Center or Message Center such that a recipient can call in for status retrieval<br>
after verifying a PIN number.<br>
f) In the case of email, two-way pager, choice of acknowledgement can be done. This will<br>
confirm recipient acknowledgement and that the date stamp is in place.<br>
