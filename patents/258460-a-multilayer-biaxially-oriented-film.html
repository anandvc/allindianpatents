In this invention, hydrocarbon resin is present in the range of 4 to 20%. In a preferred embodiment of this invention, resin is present in the range of 6 to 15%.<br>
In a more preferred embodiment, Propylene-ethylene copolymer is present in the range of 4 to 16 % and in a more preferred embodiment of the invention, propylene-ethylene copolymer is present in the range of 6-12%.<br>
In order to improve slip properties of the film slip agents such as, erucamide, Oleamide, glycerol mono stearate (GMS), waxes and metallic greases are added at a concentration between 10 and 1000ppm, preferably 20-500 ppm and more preferably, 50-150ppm. In addition, polymers from the polysiloxane group are used.<br>
To minimize static charge anti static agents comprising alkali alkanesulphonates, polyether-modified i.e., ethoxylated and/or propoxylated polysiloxanes and/or straight chain, saturated aliphatic tertiary amines, which contain an aliphatic radical with 1 0 to 20 carbon atoms and which contain two hydroxyalkyl (C1-C4) groups as substituents, among which N, N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)-alkylamines with C10-C20, preferably C12-C18 as the alkyl groups are particularly suitable.

Skin I, comprising 2.5 to 25% of the total thickness, preferably 5-12.5% of total film thickness, is made of propylene-ethylene copolymer, with an ethylene percentage of 2-6, preferably, 2-4%.<br>
Skin I also contains propylene a-olefin copolymer to enable low seal initiation. In an embodiment of this invention, skin I contains 3-15% of propylene a-olefin copolymer preferably, 5-8% of propylene a-olefin copolymer.<br>
Skin II, comprising 2.5 to 25% of the total thickness, preferably 5-12.5% of total film thickness, is made of propylene-ethylene copolymer, with an ethylene percentage of 2-6.preferably, 2-4%.<br>
Skin II also contains propylene a-olefin copolymer to enable low seal initiation. In an embodiment of this invention, skin I contains 3-15% of propylene α-olefin copolymer preferably, 5-8% of propylene a-olefin copolymer.<br>
It is also one of the intentions of this invention that the said film has good slip properties at higher temperatures. In a preferred embodiment of this invention, skin I has spherical shaped silicone beads to the tune of 500 to 2000ppm. In a more preferred embodiment of this invention, silicone resin is present between 750 and 1500ppm<br>
In a more preferred embodiment of this invention skin I &amp; skin II have differential CoF for efficient running on the machine.<br>
The films according to the invention may be produced by preferably biaxial orientation both by double bubble process and sequential stretching on a tenter frame followed by melt extrusion. Three melt streams from three extruders, namely main extruder giving the core layer, satellite I for skin I and satellite II for skin II, are pressed together in the slit die and are extruded as a single sheet. This is quenched on a chill roll and/or water bath and/or a combination of both and is<br>
stretched at least mono axially, preferably biaxiaily. in the course, the film is stretched in the machine direction or longitudinally at a ratio of 4:1 to 10:1, preferably 5:1 to 8:1, at a temperature of 90 to 150°C, preferably 100 to 130°C. This monoaxially oriented polymeric film is reheated and stretched in the cross direction or transverse direction with a stretch ratio of 7:1 to 12:1, preferably 8:1 to 9:1. This is effected at a temperature range of 130 to 190°C, preferably 145 to 170°C. So produced biaxiaily oriented polypropylene film is not allowed to heat-set at higher temperatures in TDO, in contrast, it is done at lower temperatures.<br>
At the end of this operation, final film thickness is 8 to 30µ, preferably 10 to 20µ. Before taking the film on winder, edges of the film carried by the clips of transverse direction orienter is trimmed and recycled.<br>
Such films are characterized by differential coefficient of friction (CoF), high heat shrinkage in both MD (8-10%) and TD (8-10%) at 120°C in 5 minutes.<br>
Example 1<br>
A biaxiaily oriented polypropylene multilayer film was produced by means of the coextrusion process as described elsewhere, with the preferred stretching ratios (machine direction 6.9:1 and transverse direction 9.0:1) at an average machine direction stretching temperature of 110°C and at an average transverse direction stretching temperature of 155°C. After stretching in the transverse direction, film is annealed at a temperature range of 150 to 160°C. Thickness of this film is 20 microns.   <br>

Haze<br>
Haze is the fraction of light that is scattered by angle of more than 2.5° in the medium. Scattering in the film is basically resulted out of particles distributed on the surface and interior of the film such as slip additives, anti blocking agents and impurities. It is also due to surface roughness and interface between core layer and skin layers. The measurement was made according to the ASTM D 1003 test method for % haze, after calibrating the instrument with standard haze samples between 0.3 and 34 % haze.<br>
45° Gloss<br>
Gloss is a measure of specular reflection of light from the surface and the successive layers of the film at  a specified angle. The gloss measurement was performed following ASTM D 2457. The gloss is in units GE, which are based on Wood's glass standard. The value of the surface gloss should be as high as possible.<br>
Shrinkage<br>
The said film is cut into the size of 10cm * 10cm and is kept in an hot air oven at 120°C for five minutes. Then the film is taken out and cooled to the room temperature and change in dimensions is measured. From the following formula, the percent shrinkage is calculated.<br>
% shrinkage = (Change in dimension/original dimensions) * 100<br><br><br><br><br>
