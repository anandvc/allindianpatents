This invention pertains to compounds useful for treatment of diseases associated with P2X purinergic receptors, and more particularly to P2X3 and/or P2X2/3antagonists usable for treatment of genitourinary, gastrointestinal, respiratory, and pain-related diseases, conditions and disorders.<br>
The urinary bladder is responsible for two important physiological functions: urine storage and urine emptying. This process involves two main steps: (1) the bladder fills progressively until the tension in its walls rises above a threshold level; and (2) a nervous reflex, called the micturition reflex, occurs that empties the bladder or, if this fails, at least causes a conscious desire to urinate. Although the micturition reflex is an autonomic spinal cord reflex, it can also be inhibited or mediated by centers in the cerebral cortex or brain.<br>
Purines, acting via extracellular purinoreceptors, have been implicated as having a variety of physiological and pathological roles. (See, Burnstock (1993) Drug Dev. Res. 28:195-206.) ATP, and to a lesser extent, adenosine, can stimulate sensory nerve endings resulting in intense pain and a pronounced increase in sensory nerve discharge. ATP receptors have been classified into two major families, the P2Y- and P2X-purinoreceptors, on the basis of molecular structure, transduction mechanisms, and pharmacological characterization. The P2Y-purinoreceplors are G-protein coupled receptors, while the P2X-purinoreceptors are a family of ATP-gated cation channels. Purinergic receptors, in particular, P2X receptors, are known to form homomultimers or heteromultimers. To date, cDNAs for several P2X receptors subtypes have been cloned, including: six homomeric receptors, P2Xi; P2X2; P2X3; P2X4; P2X5; and P2X7; and three heteromeric receptors P2X2/3, P2X4/6, P2X1/5 (See, e.g., Chen, et al. (1995) Nature 377:428-431; Lewis, et al. (1995) Nature 377:432-435; and Burnstock (1997) NeurophamacoL 36:1127-1139). The structure and chromosomal mapping of mouse genomic P2X3 receptor subunit has also been described (Souslova el al. (1997) Gene 195:101-111). In vitro, co-expression of P2XT and P2X3 receptor subunits is necessary to produce ATP-gated currents with the properties seen in some sensory neurons (Lewis et al, (1995) Nature 377:432-435).<br>
P2X receptor subunits are found on afferents in rodent and human bladder urothelium. Data exists suggesting that ATP may be released from cpithelial/endothelial cells of the urinary bladder or other hollow organs as a result of distention (Burnstock (1999) J. Anatomy 194:335-342; and Ferguson et al. (1997) J. Physiol. 505:503-511). ATP released in this<br><br>
manner may serve a role in conveying information to sensory neurons located in subepithelial components, e.g., suburothelial lamina propria (Namasivayam et al. (1999) BJU Intl. 84:854-860). The P2X receptors have been studied in a number of neurons, including sensory, sympathetic, parasympathetic, mesenteric, and central neurons (Zhong et al. (1998) Br. J. Pharmacol. 125:771-781). These studies indicate that purinergic receptors play a role in afferent neurotransmission from the bladder, and that modulators of P2X receptors are potentially useful in the treatment of bladder disorders and other genitourinary diseases or conditions.<br>
Recent evidence also suggests a role of endogenous ATP and purinergic receptors in nociceptive responses in mice (Tsuda et al. (1999) Br, J. Pharmacol. 128:1497-1504). ATP-induced activation of P2X receptors on dorsal root ganglion nerve terminals in the spinal cord has been shown to stimulate release of glutamate, a key neurotransmitter involved in nociceptive signaling (Gu and MacDermott, Nature 389:749-753 (1997)). P2X^ receptors have been identified on nociceptive neurons in the tooth pulp (Cook et al., Nature 387:505-508 (1997)). ATP released from damaged cells may thus lead to pain by activating P2X3 and/or P2X2/3 containing receptors on nociceptive sensory nerve endings. This is consistent with the induction of pain by intradermally applied ATP in the human blister-base model (Bleehen, Br J Pharmacol 62:573-577 (1978)). P2X antagonists have been shown to be analgesic in animal models (Driessen and Starke, Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch Pharmacol 350:618-625 (1994)). This evidence suggests that P2X2 and P2X3 are involved in nociception, and that modulators of P2X receptors are potentially useful as analgesics.<br>
Other researchers have shown that P2X-* receptors are expressed in human colon, and are expressed at higher levels in inflamed colon than in normal colon (Yiangou et al, Neuro-gastroenterol Mot (2001) 13:365-69). Other researchers have implicated the P2X3 receptor in detection of distension or intraluminal pressure in the intestine, and initiation of reflex contractions (X. Bian et al., J Physiol (2003) 551,1:309-22), and have linked this to colitis (G. Wynn et al., Am J Physiol Gastrointest Liver Physiol (2004) 287:G647-57).<br>
Inge Brouns ct al. (AmJRespir Cell Mol Biol (2000) 23:52-61) found that P2X3 receptors are expressed in pulmonary neuroepithelial bodies (NEBs), implicating the receptor in pain transmission in the lung. More recently, others have implicated P2X2 and P2X3 receptors in p02 detection in pulmonary NEBs (Rong et al., J Neurosci (2003) 23(36):11315-21).<br><br>
There is accordingly a need for methods of treating diseases, conditions and disorders mediated by P2X3 and/or P2X2/3 receptors, as well as a need for compounds that act as modulators of P2X receptors, including antagonists of P2X3 and P2X?/3 receptors. The present invention satisfies these needs as well as others.<br>
Chemical derivatization of active drug moieties is frequently undertaken for a variety of reasons including modification of the physical properties of the active drug, optimization of the pharmacokinetic parameters and site-specific targeting or localization of the active moiety to specific target tissues or cells. Albert introduced the term prodrug to describe a compound which lacks intrinsic biological activity but which is capable of metabolic transformation to the active drug substance (Albert, Selective Toxicity, Chapman and Hall, London, 1951). While the metabolic transformation can catalyzed by specific enzymes, often hydrolases, the active compound can also be released by non-specific chemical processes. Produgs have been recently reviewed (Ettmayer et al.,J. Med Chem. 2004 47(10):2393-2404; Beaumont etai, Curr. DrugMetab. 2003 4:461-485; Bundgaard, Design of Prodrugs: Bioreversibte derivatives for various functional groups and chemical entities in Design of Prodrugs, Bundgaard (ed) Elsevier Science Publishers, Amersterdam 1985).<br><br>

Representative compounds in accordance with the methods of the invention are shown in Table 1,<br>
TABLE 1<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Compounds of the present invention can be made by a variety of methods depicted in the illustrative synthetic reaction schemes shown and described below.<br>
The starting materials and reagents used in preparing these compounds generally are either available from commercial suppliers, such as Aldrich Chemical Co*, or are prepared by methods known to those skilled in the art following procedures set forth in references such as Fieser and Fieser's Reagents for Organic Synthesis; Wiley &amp; Sons: New York, 1991, Volumes 1-15; Rodd\s Chemistry of Carbon Compounds, Elsevier Science Publishers, 1989, Volumes 1-5 and Supplemental; and Organic Reactions, Wiley &amp; Sons: New York, 1991, Volumes 1-40. The following synthetic reaction schemes are merely illustrative of some methods by which the compounds of the present invention can be synthesized, and various modifications to these synthetic reaction schemes can be made and will be suggested to one skilled in the art having referred to the disclosure contained in this Application.<br>
The starting materials and the intermediates of the synthetic reaction schemes can be isolated and purified if desired using conventional techniques, including but not limited to, filtration, distillation, crystallization, chromatography, and the like. Such materials can be characterized using conventional means, including physical constants and spectral data.<br>
Unless specified to the contrary, the reactions described herein preferably are conducted under an inert atmosphere at atmospheric pressure at a reaction temperature range of from about -78°C to about 150°C, more preferably from about 0°C to about 125°C, and most preferably and conveniently at about room (or ambient) temperature, e.g., about 20°C.<br>
Scheme A below illustrates one synthetic procedure usable to prepare specific compounds of formula (I) wherein L is a leaving group and R , R% R , R and R are as defined herein.<br><br><br><br>
In step 1 of Scheme A, phenol a undergoes an O-alkylation by reaction with an acetonitrile reagent to form cyano ether compound b. Compound Ij is then treated with Bredrick's reagent (t-butoxybis(dimethylamino)methane) in step 2 to form bisdimethylamino compound c. In step 3 compound c is reacted with aniline to afford the aniline compound d. Compound d then undergoes reaction with guanidine in step 4 to provide phenoxy diamino pyrimidine e. Compound e, in step 5, is treated with acylating reagent f to afford diaminopyrimidine g, h and/or i, which are compounds of formula I in accordance with the invention. Reagent f may be, e.g., an acid chloride or other acid halide, an anhydride, or like compound* Where two or more equivalents of reagent f are used in step 5, diacylated compound i may be formed. Where only a single equivalent of reagent f is used and R1 is a bulky group such as isopropyl, compound g may be predominantly formed in step 5, Alternatively, diacyl compound i may be prepared by further acylation of monoacylated compound g or h. In certain embodiments compounds c and/or d need not be isolated as the reaction steps may be carried through in a single reaction vessel.<br>
Scheme B below illustrates another synthetic procedure usable to prepare specific compounds of formula (I) wherein L is a leaving group and R , R~, R' and R   are as defined herein.<br><br><br><br>
In Step 1 of Scheme B, benzaldehyde j is alkylated with the Grignard reagent derived from 4-chloro-5-iodo-2-methylsulfanyl-pyrimidine k or like iodopyrimidine to provide an alpha-hydroxy benzyl pyrimidine 1. The iodopyrimidine used in this step may be prepared according to the procedure described by Sakamoto et al., Chem, Pharm. Bull., 34 1986, p. 2719. Numerous substituted benzaldehydes a are commercially available or are readily prepared by techniques well known to those skilled in the art. In many instances, a "masked aldehyde", such as an imine or oxazoline, may be used used to allow introduction of desired functionalities to benzaldehyde i, after which the masked aldehyde is deprotected to provide the free aldehyde group.<br>
In step 2, alpha-hydroxy benzyl pyrimidine 1 is oxidized to provide ketone compound m. In step 3, a first amination by reaction of ammonia with ketone compound m yields aminopyrimidine phenone compound n. In step 4 the carbonyl group of compound n is reduced to a methylene group to provide benzyl aminopyridine compound o. In step 5, an oxidation of the sulfur on compound o yields methanesulfonyl compound £.   A second amination occurs in step 6 in which amino methanesulfonyl benzylpyrimidine £ is treated with ammonia to displace the methanesulfonyl group and provide diamino benzylpyrimidine fl. The diamino benzylpyrimidine fl is then subject to acylation in step 7 to afford mono and/or di-acylated compounds r, s and/or t As noted above, use of two or more equivalents of reagent f in step 5 may provide diacylated compound s. while only a single equivalent of reagent f in the presence of a bulky R1 group may provide predominantly monoacylated compound r.<br><br>
Numerous variations on the above procedure are possible and will suggest themselves to those skilled in the art upon review of this disclosure. Specific details for producing compounds of the invention are described in the Examples section below.<br>
The compounds of the invention are usable as prodrugs for the treatment of a wide range of genitorurinary diseases, conditions and disorders, including urinary tract disease states associated with bladder outlet obstruction and urinary incontinence conditions such as reduced bladder capacity, frequency of micturition, urge incontinence, stress incontinence, bladder hyperreactivity, benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH), prostatitis, detrusor hyper-reflexia, urinary frequency, nocturia, urinary urgency, overactive bladder, pelvic hypersensitivity, urethritis, prostatitits, pelvic pain syndrome, prostatodynia, cystitis, and idio-phatic bladder hypersensitivity, and other symptoms related to overactive bladder.<br>
The compounds of the invention are expected to find utility as analgesics in the treatment of diseases and conditions associated with pain from a wide variety of causes, including, but not limited to, inflammatory pain, surgical pain, visceral pain, dental pain, premenstrual pain, central pain, pain due to burns, migraine or cluster headaches, nerve injury, neuritis, neuralgias, poisoning, ischemic injury, interstitial cystitis, cancer pain, viral, parasitic or bacterial infection, post-traumatic injuries (including fractures and sports injuries), and pain associated with functional bowel disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome.<br>

Formulations containing about one (1) milligram of active ingredient or,<br><br>
more broadly, about 0,01 to about one hundred (100) milligrams, per tablet, are accordingly suitable representative unit dosage forms.<br>
The compounds of the invention may be formulated in a wide variety of oral administration dosage forms. The pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms may comprise a compound or compounds of the present invention or pharmaceutical^ acceptable salts thereof as the active component. The pharmaceutical^ acceptable carriers may be either solid or liquid. Solid form preparations include powders, tablets, pills, capsules, cachets, suppositories, and dispersible granules. A solid carrier may be one or more substances which may also act as diluents, flavouring agents, solubilizers, lubricants, suspending agents, binders, preservatives, tablet disintegrating agents, or an encapsulating material In powders, the carrier generally is a finely divided solid which is a mixture with the finely divided active component. In tablets, the active component generally is mixed with the carrier having the necessary binding capacity in suitable proportions and compacted in the shape and size desired. The powders and tablets preferably contain from about one (1) to about seventy (70) percent of the active compound- Suitable carriers include but are not limited to magnesium carbonate, magnesium stearate, talc, sugar, lactose, pectin, dextrin, starch, gelatine, tragacanth, methylcellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, a low melting wax, cocoa butter, and the like. The term "preparation" is intended to include the formulation of the active compound with encapsulating material as carrier, providing a capsule in which the active component, with or without carriers, is surrounded by a carrier, which is in association with it. Similarly, cachets and lozenges are included. Tablets, powders, capsules, pills, cachets, and lozenges may be as solid forms suitable for oral administration.<br>
Other forms suitable for oral administration include liquid form preparations including emulsions, syrups, elixirs, aqueous solutions, aqueous suspensions, or solid form preparations which are intended to be converted shortly before use to liquid form preparations. Emulsions may be prepared in solutions, e,g., in aqueous propylene glycol solutions or may contain emulsifying agents, e.g., such as lecithin, sorbitan monooleate, or acacia. Aqueous solutions can be prepared by dissolving the active component in water and adding suitable colorants, flavors, stabilizers, and thickening agents* Aqueous suspensions can be prepared by dispersing the finely divided active component in water with viscous material, such as natural or synthetic gums, resins, methylcellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, and other<br><br>
well known suspending agents. Solid form preparations include solutions, suspensions, and emulsions, and may contain, in addition to the active component, colorants, flavors, stabilizers, buffers, artificial and natural sweeteners, dispersants, thickeners, solubilizing agents, and the like.<br>
The compounds of the invention may be formulated for parenteral administration (e.g., by injection, e.g. bolus injection or continuous infusion) and may be presented in unit dose form in ampoules, pre-filled syringes, small volume infusion or in multi-dose containers with an added preservative. The compositions may take such forms as suspensions, solutions, or emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles, e.g. solutions in aqueous polyethylene glycol. Examples of oily or nonaqueous carriers, diluents, solvents or vehicles include propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, vegetable oils (e.g., olive oil), and injectable organic esters (e.g., ethyl oleate), and may contain formulatory agents such as preserving, wetting, emulsifying or suspending, stabilizing and/or dispersing agents. Alternatively, the active ingredient may be in powder form, obtained by aseptic isolation of sterile solid or by lyophilization from solution for constitution before use with a suitable vehicle, e.g., sterile, pyrogen-free water.<br>
The compounds of the invention may be formulated for topical administration to the epidermis as ointments, creams or lotions, or as a transdermal patch. Ointments and creams may, e.g., be formulated with an aqueous or oily base with the addition of suitable thickening and/or gelling agents. Lotions may be formulated with an aqueous or oily base and will in general also containing one or more emulsifying agents, stabilizing agents, dispersing agents, suspending agents, thickening agents, or coloring agents. Formulations suitable for topical administration in the mouth include lozenges comprising active agents in a flavored base, usually sucrose and acacia or tragacanth; pastilles comprising the active ingredient in an inert base such as gelatine and glycerine or sucrose and acacia; and mouthwashes comprising the active ingredient in a suitable liquid carrier.<br>
The compounds of the invention may be formulated for administration as suppositories. A low melting wax, such as a mixture of fatty acid glycerides or cocoa butter is first melted and the active component is dispersed homogeneously, e.g., by stirring. The molten homogeneous mixture is then poured into convenient sized molds, allowed to cool, and to solidify.<br><br>
The compounds of the invention may be formulated for vaginal administration. Pessaries, tampons, creams, gels, pastes, foams or sprays containing in addition to the active ingredient such carriers as are known in the art to be appropriate.<br>
The subject compounds may be formulated for nasal administration. The solutions or suspensions are applied directly to the nasal cavity by conventional means, e.g., with a dropper, pipette or spray. The formulations may be provided in a single or multidose form. In the latter case of a dropper or pipette, this may be achieved by the patient administering an appropriate, predetermined volume of the solution or suspension. In the case of a spray, this may be achieved e.g. by means of a metering atomizing spray pump.<br>
The compounds of the invention may be formulated for aerosol administration, particularly to the respiratory tract and including intranasal administration. The compound will generally have a small particle size e.g. of the order of five (5) microns or less. Such a particle size may be obtained by means known in the art, e.g. by micronization. The active ingredient is provided in a pressurized pack with a suitable propellant such as a chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), e.g., dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane, or dichlorotetrafluoroethane, or carbon dioxide or other suitable gas. The aerosol may conveniently also contain a surfactant such as lecithin. The dose of drug may be controlled by a metered valve. Alternatively the active ingredients may be provided in a form of a dry powder, e.g. a powder mix of the compound in a suitable powder base such as lactose, starch, starch derivatives such as hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose and polyvinylpyrrolidine (PVP). The powder carrier will form a gel in the nasal cavity. The powder composition may be presented in unit dose form e.g. in capsules or cartridges of e.g., gelatine or blister packs from which the powder may be administered by means of an inhaler.<br>
When desired, formulations can be prepared with enteric coatings adapted for sustained or controlled release administration of the active ingredient. For example, the compounds of the present invention can be formulated in transdermal or subcutaneous drug delivery devices. These delivery systems are advantageous when sustained release of the compound is necessary and when patient compliance with a treatment regimen is crucial. Compounds in transdermal delivery systems are frequently attached to an skin-adhesive solid support. The compound of interest can also be combined with a penetration enhancer, e.g., Azone (1-dodecylazacycloheptan-2-one). Sustained release delivery systems are inserted<br><br>
subcutaneously into the subdermal layer by surgery or injection. The subdermal implants encapsulate the compound in a lipid soluble membrane, e.g., silicone rubber, or a biodegradable polymer, e.g., polylactic acid.<br>
The pharmaceutical preparations are preferably in unit dosage forms. In such form, the preparation is subdivided into unit doses containing appropriate quantities of the active component. The unit dosage form can be a packaged preparation, the package containing discrete quantities of preparation, such as packeted tablets, capsules, and powders in vials or ampoules. Also, the unit dosage form can be a capsule, tablet, cachet, or lozenge itself, or it can be the appropriate number of any of these in packaged form.<br>
Other suitable pharmaceutical carriers and their formulations are described in Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy 1995, edited by Martin, Mack Publishing Company, 19th edition, Easton, Pennsylvania* Representative pharmaceutical formulations containing a compound of the present invention are described below.<br>

The synthetic procedure used in this Example is outlined in Scheme C.<br><br>
Step 1 2-Isopropvl-4-methoxv-phenol<br>
To a cooled solution of l-(2-Hydroxy-5-methoxy-phenyl)-ethanone (10.0 g) in 80 mL of THF was gradually added 46.4 g of 3M solution of MeMgCl in THF at a rate such that the reaction mixture temperature did not exceed 25°C Following addition of the MeMgCl solution, the reaction mixture was stirred at RT for 18 hours. To the stirred solution was then added 10% palladium on carbon (1.02 g, 50% water wet) suspended in 4 mL of THF. The reaction mixture was placed under a hydrogen atmosphere at 5 psig and cooling was applied to maintain a temperature of approximately 25 °C. To the cooled mixture was gradually added concentrated HC1 (20 mL) while maintaining the reaction temperature at 25°C. The resultant mixture was stirred at RT for 18 hours, then treated with 45 mL water and filtered through a bed of Celite to remove suspended catalyst. The filter cake was rinsed with EtOAc<br><br>
and the combined filtrate was separated. The organic phase was washed with water, then concentrated under reduced pressure to give 10.4 g of 2-isopropyl~4-methoxy-phenol, MS (M+H) = 167. This product was dissolved in 2-butanone (20.4 g) and the crude solution was employed directly in the next step.<br>
Step 2   (2-Isopropyl-4-methoxv-phenoxvVacetonitrile<br>
A stirred slurry of toluene-4-sulfonic acid cyanomethyl ester (13.0 g), potassium carbonate (13.0 g) and 2-isopropyl-4-methoxyphenol (9.57 g) in 85 mL of 2-butanone was heated to 55-60°C for 4 days, then heated to relux for 18 hours. The resultant slurry was cooled and filtered to remove solids.

Example 8:    P2XVP2X2/3 FLIPR (Fluorometric Imaging Plate Reader) Assay<br>
CHO-K1 cells were transfected with cloned rat P2X3 or human P2X2/3 receptor subunits and passaged in flasks. 18-24 hours before the FLIPR experiment, cells were released from their flasks, centrifuged, and resuspended in nutrient medium at 2.5 x 105 cells/ml The cells were aliquoted into black-walled 96-well plates at a density of 50,000 cells/well and incubated overnight in 5% C02 at 37°C. On the day of the experiment, cells were washed in FLIPR buffer (calcium- and magnesium-free Hank's balanced salt solution, 10 mM HEPES, 2 mM CaCh, 2.5 mM probenecid; FB). Each well received 100 \il FB and 100 \xl of the fluorescent dye Fluo-3 AM [2 (J.M final cone.]. After a 1 hour dye loading incubation at 37°C, the cells were washed 4 times with FB, and a final 75 pl/well FB was left in each well. Test compounds (dissolved in DMSO at 10 mM and serially diluted with FB) or vehicle were added to each well (25 \il of a 4X solution) and allowed to equilibrate for 20 min at RT. The plates were then placed in the FLIPR and a baseline fluorescence measurement (excitation at 488 nm and emission at 510-570 nm) was obtained for 10 seconds before a 100 nl/well agonist or vehicle addition. The agonist was a 2X solution of a,p-meATP producing a final concentration of 1 (xM (P2X3) or 5 nM (P2X2/3). Fluorescence was measured for an additional 2 min at 1 second intervals after agonist addition. A final addition of ionomycin (5 |j.Ms final concentration) was made to each well of the FLIPR test plate to establish cell viability and maximum fluorescence of dye-bound cytosolic calcium. Peak fluorescence in response to the addition of a,(3-meATP (in the absence and presence of test compounds) was measured and inhibition curves generated using nonlinear regression. PPADS, a standard P2X antagonist, was used as a positive control<br>

Example 10: Volume Induced Bladder Contraction Assay<br>
Female Sprague-Dawley rats (200-300g) were anesthetized with urethane (1.5 g/kg, sc). The animals were tracheotomized, and a carotid artery and femoral vein were cannulated for blood pressure measurement and drug administration, respectively. A laparotomy was performed and the ureters were ligated and transected proximal to the ligation. The external urethral meatus was ligated with silk suture and the urinary bladder was cannulated via the dome for saline infusion and bladder pressure measurement.<br>
Following a 15-30 min stabilization period the bladder was infused with RT saline at 100 pi/min until continuous volume-induced bladder contractions (VIBCs) were observed. The infusion rate was then lowered to 3-5 ^1/min for 30 min before the bladder was drained and allowed to rest for 30 min. All subsequent infusions were performed as indicated except the lower infusion rate was maintained for only 15 min instead of 30 min. Bladder filling and draining cycles were repeated until the threshold volumes (TV; the volume needed to trigger the first micturition bladder contraction) varied by less than 10% for two consecutive baselines and contraction frequency was within 2 contractions for a 10 minute period following the slower infusion rate. Once reproducible TVs and VIBCs were established the bladder was drained and the animal was dosed with drug or vehicle (0.5 ml/kg, i.v.) 3 min prior to the start of the next scheduled infusion.<br>
Example 11:  Formalin Pain Assay<br>
Male Sprague Dawley rats (180-220 g) are placed in individual Plexiglas cylinders and allowed to acclimate to the testing environment for 30 min. Vehicle, drug or positive control<br><br>
(morphine 2 mg/kg) is administered subcutaneously at 5 ml/kg. 15 min post dosing, formalin (5% in 50 JJI) is injected into plantar surface of the right hind paw using a 26-gauge needle. Rats are immediately put back to the observation chamber. Mirrors placed around the chamber allow unhindered observation of the formalin-injected paw. The duration of nociphensive behavior of each animal is recorded by a blinded observer using an automated behavioral timer. Hindpaw licking and shaking / lifting are recorded separately in 5 min bin, for a total of 60 min. The sum of time spent licking or shaking in seconds from time 0 to 5 min is considered the early phase, whereas the late phase is taken as the sum of seconds spent licking or shaking from 15 to 40 min. A plasma sample is collected.<br>
Example 12:  Colon Pain Assay<br>
Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (350-425 g; Harlan, Indianapolis, IN) are housed 1-2 per cage in an animal care facility. Rats are deeply anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium (45 mg/kg) administered intraperitoneally. Electrodes are placed and secured into the external oblique musculature for electromyographic (EMG) recording. Electrode leads are tunneled subcutaneously and exteriorized at the nape of the neck for future access. After surgery, rats are housed separately and allowed to recuperate for 4-5 days prior to testing. The descending colon and rectum are distended by pressure-controlled inflation of a 7-8 cm-long flexible latex balloon tied around a flexible tube, The balloon is lubricated, inserted into the colon via the anus, and anchored by taping the balloon catheter to the base of the tail. Colorectal distension (CRD) is achieved by opening a solenoid gate to a constant pressure air reservoir. Intracolonic pressure is controlled and continuously monitored by a pressure control device. Response is quantified as the visceromotor response (VMR), a contraction of the abdominal and hindlimb musculature, EMG activity produced by contraction of the external oblique musculature is quantified using Spike2 software (Cambridge Electronic Design). Each distension trial lasts 60 sec, and EMG activity is quantified for 20 sec before distension (baseline), during 20 sec distension, and 20 sec after distention. The increase in total number of recorded counts during distension above baseline is defined as the response. Stable baseline responses to CRD (10, 20, 40 and 80 mmHg, 20 seconds, 4 min apart) are obtained in conscious, unsedated rats before any treatment.<br>
Compounds are evaluated for effects on responses to colon distension initially in a model of acute visceral nociception and a model of colon hypersensitivity produced by intracolonic<br><br>
treatment with zymosan (1 mL, 25 mg/mL) instilled into the colon with a gavage needle inserted to a depth of about 6 cm. Experimental groups will consist of 8 rats each. Acute visceral nociception: For testing effects of drug on acute visceral nociception, 1 of 3 doses of drug, vehicle or positive control (morphine, 2.5 mg/kg) are administered after baseline responses are established; responses to distension are followed over the next 60-90 min.<br>
Visceral hypersensitivity; For testing effects of drug or vehicle after intracolonic treatment with zymosan, intracolonic treatment is given after baseline responses are established. Prior to drug testing at 4 hours, responses to distension are assessed to establish the presence of hypersensitivity. In zymosan-treated rats, administration of 1 of 3 doses of drug, vehicle or positive control (morphine, 2.5 mg/kg) are given 4 hours after zymosan treatment and responses to distension followed over the next 60-90 min.<br>
Example 13:  Cold allodynia in Rats with a Chronic Constriction Injury of the Sciatic Nerve<br>
The effects of compounds of this invention on cold allodynia are determined using the chronic constriction injury (CCI) model of neuropathic pain in rats, where cold allodynia is measured in a cold-water bath with a metal-plate floor and water at a depth of 1.5-2*0 cm and a temperature of 3-4°C (Gogas et ah, Analgesia, 1997, 3,1-8).<br>
Specifically, CCI, rats are anesthetized; the trifurcation of the sciatic nerve is located and 4 ligatures (4-0, or 5-0 chromic gut) are placed circumferentially around the sciatic nerve proximal to the trifurcation. The rats are then allowed to recover from the surgery. On days 4-7 after surgery, the rats are initially assessed for cold -induced allodynia by individually placing the animals in the cold-water bath and recording the total lifts of the injured paw during a 1-min period of time: The injured paw is lifted out of the water. Paw lifts associated with locomotion or body repositioning are not recorded. Rats that displayed 5 lifts per min or more on day 4-7 following surgery are considered to exhibit cold allodynia and are used in subsequent studies. In the acute studies, vehicle, reference compound or compounds of this invention are administered subcutaneously (s.c.) 30 min before testing. The effects of repeated administration of the compounds of this invention on cold allodynia are determined 14, 20 or 38 h following the last oral dose of the following regimen: oral<br><br>
(p.o.) administration of vehicle, reference or a compound of this invention at -12 h intervals (BID) for 7 days.<br>
Example 14:  Cancer Bone Pain in C3H/HeJ Mice<br>
The effects of compounds of this invention on bone pain are determined between Day 7 to Day 18 following intramedullary injection of 2472 sarcoma cells into the distal femur of C3H/HeJ mice.<br>
Specifically, NCTC 2472 tumor cells (American Type Culture Collection, ATCC), previously shown to form lytic lesions in bone after intramedullary injection, are grown and maintained according to ATCC recommendations. Approximately 105 cells are injected directly into the medullary cavity of the distal femur in anesthetized C3H/HeJ mice. Beginning on about Day 7, the mice are assessed for spontaneous nocifensive behaviors (flinching &amp; guarding), palpation-evoked nocifensive behaviors (flinching &amp; guarding), forced ambultory guarding and limb use. The effects of compounds of this invention are determined following a single acute (s.c.) administration on Day 7 - Day 15. In addition, the effects of repeated (BID) administration of compounds of this invention from Day 7 - Day 15 are determined within 1 hour of the first dose on Days 7, 9,11,13 and 15.<br>
Example 15:  Determination of Pharmacokinetic parameters<br>
Male Crl:WI(GLx/BRlVHan)IGS BR (Hanover-Wistar) rats weighing 200-250 g were cannulated. Groups of three rats were used for each dose level of an experimental compound and one (1) non-cannulated rat was used as a vehicle control. Animals were allowed normal access to chow and water throughout the experiment. The prodrug (N-[4-amino-5-(5-iodo-2-isopropyl-4-methoxy-phenoxy)-pyrimidin-2-yl]-butyramide) was formulated as an aqueous solution or an aqueous suspension and a dose equivalent to (0.127 mmol) was administered orally by gavage. A blood sample (0.3 mL) was collected from the treated rats at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 8 hours after via the jugular cannula. A sample of at least 0.3 mL of blood was withdrawn from the untreated animals 3 h after dosing. After 24 h from dosing, as much blood as possible was collected from all treated and control animals. Potassium oxalate/NaF was added to the samples which were stored on ice during sampling procedure. The samples were spun in a refrigerated centrifuge at -4°C as soon as possible and the plasma samples were stored -20°C immediately after centrifugation and later transferred to a -80°C freezer<br><br>
