				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>Improvements relating to automatic injection devices There are various forms of automatic injection device which when operated cause the needle of a syringe to be moved forwardly so that it projects from a protective housing prior to actuation of the syringe to express a dose of liquid through the needle. It is important to try to ensure that the syringe is moved bodily forward to expose the needle before the liquid charge is pressurised so that dribbling from the needle does not occur before the actual injection takes place. It is an object of this invention to provide a mechanism which operates in this desired manner.<br>
According to the invention there is provided an injection device for causing a dose of liquid to be ejected from the needle at one end of a syringe located within a housing of the device, the syringe being movable by a plunger, upon release of an actuating bias member at one end of the housing, to move the syringe, from a first position wherein the needle is shrouded by the housing, to a second position wherein the needle projects from the other end of the housing, the plunger being in the form of a rod with a longitudinally centrally located flexible projecting portion which, prior to release of said actuating bias member, is situated beyond the other end of the syringe, such that a primary movement of the plunger, under the bias of the actuating bias member, will cause the projecting portion to bear against the other end of the syringe such that the syringe is moved from said first to said second position, whereupon arresting of further movement of the syringe, results in the flexible portion collapsing inwardly so that it enters the syringe, thus enabling the plunger to move by a secondary movement, within the syringe, into contact with and to act<br>
upon a plug to compress the liquid within the syringe and cause expression of the liquid through the syringe needle.<br>
With such an arrangement, the projecting portion will remain in its projecting position (in order to move the syringe from the first to the second position) until the force increases to such an extent which allows the projecting portion to collapse inwardly so that the plunger can then move within the syringe to cause the liquid to be expressed through the syringe.<br>
The projecting portion can comprise one or more flexible elbows projecting beyond the normal circumference of the rod, but compressible into said circumference. This could be in the form of two elbows defined either side of a longitudinal slit in the rod. The elbows could be pre-formed as a pair of arms either side of the longitudinal slit between upper and lower solid portions of the rod.<br>
Preferably the injection device will contain a return bias member acting between the syringe housing and the other end of the syringe to hold the syringe retracted within the housing until the actuating bias member is released.<br>
One or more of the bias members provided within the housing can be in the form of a coil spring.<br>
The invention may be performed in various ways and a preferred example thereof will now be described, with reference to the accompanying diagrammatic drawings, in which:<br>
Figure 1 Figure 1 is a sectional view through an injection device of this invention prior to use; and<br>
Figures 2 and 3 are similar views showing successive stages of operation<br>
of the injection member.<br>
The injection device shown in the drawings comprises a syringe 1 located within a protective housing 2. The syringe comprises a 3 incorporating a liquid dose held in place by a bung 4 and having a needle 5 through which the dose can be ejected by applying pressure to the bung 4. The 3 has an enlarged head 6. A plunger 7 is biased forwardly by a coil spring 8, but is held back in a latched position (Figure 1) until such time as a trigger shown schematically at 11 is actuated to release the plunger and the spring 8. Prior to use the syringe 1 is held retracted in the housing 2 by a coil spring 9.<br>
It will be seen that the plunger 7 is in the form of a rod having a central portion which defines a pair of projecting elbows 10. These can be pre-formed as part of a moulded plunger 7. The projecting elbow portions 10 are flexible so that they can be moved inwardly to cause that portion of the rod to adopt a circumference similar to that of the rest of the rod. As can be seen in Figure 2, when the plunger is released and biased by the spring 8 the expanded region formed by the elbows 10 rests against the head 6 of the 3 and the force provided is sufficient to compress the spring 9 until such time as the head 6 abuts the top of the housing 2, whereupon further movement of the 3 is arrested. The continual bias created by the spring 8 then causes the elbows 10 to be compressed inwardly as they enter into the interior of the 3. With the elbows 10 in the collapsed state, the plunger can then move relatively easily within the 3 so as to act upon the bung 4 and thus cause the contents of the syringe to be ejected through the needle 5.<br>
The illustrated configuration of the plunger 7 provides several technical<br>
advantages. It can be moulded integrally. Also the collapsing movement of the projecting elbows provides an arrangement which can provide a suitable injection force to cause the needle to enter the skin to a suitable depth, but then provide a relatively low drag against the inner wall of the syringe container so that the major portion of the thrust of the spring for the remainder of its stroke is applied to the bung 4. It will be appreciated that other configurations of collapsing projection could be used in place of the collapsing elbows.<br><br><br>
Claims<br>
An injection device for causing a dose of liquid to be ejected from a<br>
needle at one end of a syringe (1) located within a housing (2) of the device, the<br>
syringe containing a moveable bung (4) and the syringe being movable by a<br>
plunger (7), upon release of an actuating bias member (8) at one end of the<br>
housing (2), to move the syringe (1), from a first position wherein the needle (5)<br>
is shrouded by the housing (2), to a second position wherein the needle projects<br>
from the other end of the housing, the plunger being in the form of a rod with a<br>
longitudinally centrally located flexible projecting portion (10) which, prior to<br>
release of said actuating bias member, is situated beyond the other end (6) of<br>
the syringe (1) and initially spaced from the bung (4), such that a primary<br>
movement of the plunger (7), under the bias of the actuating bias member (8),<br>
will cause the projecting portion (10) to bear against the other end (6) of the<br>
syringe such that the syringe is moved from said first to said second position,<br>
whereupon arresting of further movement of the syringe, results in the flexible<br>
portion (10) collapsing inwardly so that it enters the syringe, thus enabling the<br>
plunger (7) to move by a secondary movement, within the syringe, into contact<br>
with and to act upon said bung (4) to compress the liquid within the syringe and<br>
cause expression of the liquid through the syringe needle (5).<br>
An injection device as claimed in claim 1, wherein the projecting<br>
portion (10) comprises one or more flexible elbows projecting beyond the normal<br>
circumference of the rod (7), but compressible into said circumference.<br>
An injection device as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2, wherein two<br>
elbows (10) are defined either side of a longitudinal slit in the rod (7).<br>
An injection device as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 3, wherein<br>
the elbows are preformed as a pair of arms (10) either side of the longitudinal slit<br>
between upper and lower solid portions of the rod (7).<br>
An injection device as claimed  in any one of claims 1  to 4,<br>
including a return bias member (9) acting between the syringe housing (2) and<br>
the other end of the syringe (6) to hold the syringe (1) retracted within the<br>
housing (2) until the actuating bias member (8) is released.<br>
An injection device as claimed in claims 1 to 5, wherein one or<br>
more of the bias members (8, 9) provided within the housing is in the form of a<br>
coil spring.<br>
7.        An injection device comprising:<br>
a housing (2);<br>
a syringe (1) slideably mounted within said housing for movement between a shrouded retracted position and an extended injecting position;<br>
a bung (4) slideably mounted in said syringe (1) and moveable to expel a liquid dose through a needle (5) at the distal end of the syringe;<br>
a plunger (7) having an end initially spaced from, but operable to engage said bung (4) and to transmit an expulsion force thereto, and<br>
a bias spring (8) operable to move said plunger from a first position to a second position,<br>
characterised in that said plunger is provided with at least one integrally<br>
formed collapsible projecting region (10) which is outside said syringe<br>
when said plunger (7) is at its first position but which in use on movement<br>
away from said first position engages the proximal end (6) of said syringe (1) to drive it to its extended position whereupon arresting of further movement of said syringe (1) causes said collapsible projecting region (10) to collapse inwardly so that it enters the syringe to allow said plunger to engage said bung (4) and expel a liquid dose.</td>
