DESCR1PTION TR1SAZO COMPOUND, INK COMPOSITION, RECORDING METHOD, AND<br>
COLORED ARTICLE<br>
Technical Field [0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a novel tR1sazo compound or a salt thereof, an inlk composition containing these and a colored article therewith.<br>
Background Art [0002]<br>
In the recording method by means of an Inkjet pR1nter which is one of the typical methods among vaR1ous color recording methods, ink droplets are generated and adhered onto vaR1ous record-receiving mateR1als (such as paper, film and cloth) to perform recording. This method has been rapidly prevailing lately and is expected to continue growing remarkably in the future because of such features as quietness with less noise generation due to no direct contact of a recording head with a record-receiving mateR1al and as easiness in downsizing and speedup. Conventionally, as an ink for fountain pens, felt-tip pens and the like and an ink for Inkjet recording, water-based inks where a water-soluble dye is dissolved in an aqueous medium have been used, and in these water-based inks, a water-soluble organic solvent is generally added to prevent ink from clogging at a pen tip or an Inkjet nozzle. Therefore, these inks are required to provide recorded images with sufficient density, not to clog at a pen tip or a nozzle, to dry quickly on record-receiving mateR1als, to bleed less, to have excellent storage stability and so on. In addition, a water-soluble dye to be used is required to have high solubility especially in water and in a water-soluble organic solvent to be added to the ink. Further, formed images are required to have image fastnesses such as<br><br>
water fastness, light fastness, ozone gas fastness and moisture fastness. [0003]<br>
Among these, the ozone gas fastness means durability against the phenomenon that ozone gas and the like having oxidizing effect, which exist in the air, react with a dye in recording paper to cause discoloration or fading of pR1nted images. Besides ozone gas, oxidizing gases having this type of effect include NOx, SOx and the like, and ozone gas is, among these oxidizing gases, regarded as a main causative substance to further promote the phenomenon of discoloration or fading of Inkjet recorded images. IVIany of ink receiving layers provided on the surfaces of special paper for photo quality Inkjet employ a mateR1al such as porous white inorganic substance and the like in order to dry ink sooner and to make bleeding less in high image quality, resulting in that on such recording paper, discoloration or fading caused by ozone gas is noticeably observed. As this phenomenon of discoloration or fading caused by ozone gas is a characteR1stic of Inkjet images, improvement of ozone gas fastness is one of important challenges in the Inkjet recording method. [0004]<br>
In order to extend the use field of the pR1nting method using ink in the future, ink compositions to be used for Inkjet recording and colored articles colored therewith are strongly required to have light fastness, ozone gas fastness, moisture fastness and water fastness which are further improved. [0005]<br>
While inks with vaR1ous hues have been prepared from vaR1ous dyes, black ink among them is an important ink to be used for both mono color and full color images. Many dyes for these black inks have been proposed up to the present, but any product sufficiently satisfying the market requirements has been not provided yet. Many of the proposed coloR1ng matters are azo coloR1ng matters, and among them, disazo coloR1ng matters such as C.I.Food Black 2 have such problems that the optical density of images is low, water<br><br>
fastness and moisture fastness are too low, and light fastness and gas fastness are not sufficient. Polyazo coloR1ng matters where the conjugate system is extended have such problems that bronzing phenomenon having metallic luster is apt to generate partially on recorded images because their water-solubility is generally low, and that light fastness and gas fastness are not sufficient. In addition, in the case of metal-containing azo coloR1ng matter proposed in large numbers as well, some of them have good light fastness but also have such problems that they are not preferable in view of safety to creatures and environment due to containing a metal ion and that ozone gas fastness is extremely poor. [0006]<br>
A compound (coloR1ng matter) for black ink for Inkjet which has been improved on ozone gas fastness which becomes the most important problem in recent years includes, for example, the compounds descR1bed in Patent Literatures 1 and 2. These compounds don't sufficiently satisfy the market requirements on ozone gas fastness and their light fastness is not sufficient, either. In addition, azo compounds having a benzimidazolopyR1done skeleton which is a characteR1stic of the coloR1ng matter compound for black ink of the present invention are descR1bed in Patent Literatures 3 to 6 and the like. Patent Literature 4 and 5 disclose tR1sazo compounds, which have a symmetR1cal structure where two benzimidazolopyR1done skeletons are further bonded to the both ends of a linking group containing an azo structure by an azo structure, and any similar compound to the unsymmetR1cal tR1sazo compound of the present invention has not been disclosed yet. Further, there are only a small number of water-soluble compounds and there is no example of their use as a black compound for Inkjet ink. [0007]<br>
Black inks where yellow to orange dyes are further formulated in a black dye have been proposed, for example, in Patent Literatures 7 to 11, but any<br><br>
product has not been provided yet which sufficiently satisfies the marlk:et requirements in terms of pR1nt quality, ozone fastness and light fastness.<br>
Patent   Literature   12  discloses  the  compound   represented   by  the following formula (5) which is one of the coloR1ng matter compounds to be used in the present invention. [0008]<br>
In addition, a black ink containing two black dyes and yellow to orange dyes is proposed as an ink composition improved on ozone fastness, light fastness and the like, in Patent Literature 13, and it has an excellent hue and color density as black color but has not sufficiently satisfied the recent market requirements yet in terms of the fastnesses (ozone fastness and light fastness).<br>

test) X 100 (%) to evaluate according to the following criteria.<br>
o Residual rate: 90% or more<br>
^ Residual rate: under 90% and 80% or more<br>
X Residual rate: under 80% The results are shown in Table 5. 2) Ozone Gas Fastness Test<br>

As is clear from the results of Table 5, the images recorded with the ink compositions containing the azo compound of the present invention exhibited equal fastness or better fastness with regard to ozone gas fastness in comparison with the images of the conventional black dyes (Comparative Examples), and had good results on any of special glossy papers. That is, the residual rate of the coloring matter was under 60% in the case of using Special glossy paperl in Comparative Examples 1 and 2, while the residual rate of the coloring matter was 70% or more even in the case of using any of the special glossy papers in Examples 1-7 to 1-10 and 2-10 of the present invention. In addition, there appeared obvious difference in light fastness, which is because the residual rate of the coloring matter was 90% or more (o) even in the case of using any of the special glossy papers in Examples 1-7 to 1-10 and 2-10 where the ink compositions containing the azo compound of the present invention were used, while the residual rate of the coloring matter was under<br><br>
90% and 80% or more {^) in any case of using Special glossy paper 2 and also the residual rate of the coloring matter was under 80% in any case of using Special glossy paper 1, in Comparative Examples 1 and 2.

Using each of the water-based black ink compositions of the present invention which were obtained above, Inkjet recording was performed on two kinds of paper, special glossy paper A (trade name: Professional Photopaper PR-101, manufactured by Canon Inc.) and special glossy paper B (trade name: Super Photopaper SP-101, manufactured by Canon Inc.) by an ink jet<br><br>
printer (trade name: PIXUS iP4100, manufactured by Canon Inc.). In printing, such an image pattern was made that several graduations of reflection density were obtained, and a black printed matter of half tone was obtained. Among the test methods described below, in measurement for hue evaluation which is an item of evaluation using a colorimeter, the part of this printed matter where the reflection density D value was the most highest was used for colorimeter of a* value and b* value of the printed matter. Similarly, in measurement for light fastness test and ozone gas fastness test using a colorimeter, the measurement was conducted using the graduation part of the printed matters where the reflection density D value before the test was the nearest to 1.0. Hue evaluation was conducted on the whole printed matter by visual observation. [0362] (C) Evaluation of Recorded Image<br>
The recorded images with the water-based ink composition of the present invention were evaluated on hue, print density, change of hue after the light fastness test and change of hue after ozone gas fastness test. The results are shown in Table 24. The test method is described below. (1) Hue Evaluation<br>
In hue evaluation (numeric data) of the printed images, evaluation by visual observation and evaluation by a colorimetry are employed in combination. For evaluation by a colorimetry, a* value and b* value were measured using Gretag Macbeth SpectroEye (trade name, manufactured by GretagMacbeth AG) to calculate C* value. The formula to calculate C* value is C*= {(a*)2+ (b*)2}i/2. The evaluation criteria are shown below.<br>
o Good black without color by visual observation, having C* 
^ Good black without color by visual observation, having 6.0 ^ C*i 10 from colorimetry<br><br>
X Black with color by visual observation or without color by visual observation, having 10 
(2)	Evaluation of Print Density<br>
