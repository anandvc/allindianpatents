				<td>The present invention relates to a process for the synthesis of ivabradine of formula (I):<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
or 3-{3-[{[(7S)-3,4-dimethoxybicyclo[4.2.0]octa-1,3,5-trien-7-yl]methyl}(methyl)amino]-propyl} -7,8-dimethoxy-1,3,4,5-tetrahydro-2H-3-benzazepin-2-one,<br>
addition salts thereof with a pharmaceutically acceptable acid, and hydrates thereof.<br>
Ivabradine, and its addition salts with a pharmaceutically acceptable acid, and more especially its hydrochloride, have very valuable pharmacological and therapeutic properties, especially bradycardic properties, making those compounds useful in the treatment or prevention of various clinical situations of myocardial ischaemia such as angina pectoris, myocardial infarct and associated rhythm disturbances, and also in various pathologies involving rhythm disturbances, especially supraventricular rhythm disturbances, and in heart failure.<br>
The preparation and therapeutic use of ivabradine and its addition salts with a pharmaceutically acceptable acid, and more especially its hydrochloride, have been described in the European patent specification EP 0 534 859.<br>
That patent specification describes the synthesis of ivabradine hydrochloride starting from the compound of formula (II):<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
which is resolved to yield the compound of formula (III):<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
which is reacted with the compound of formula (IV):<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
to yield the compound of formula (V):<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
the catalytic hydrogenation of which yields ivabradine, which is then converted into its hydrochloride.<br>
The disadvantage of that synthesis route is that it results in ivabradine in a yield of only 1 %.<br>
In view of the pharmaceutical value of this compound, it has been important to be able to obtain it by an effective synthesis process resulting in ivabradine in a good yield.<br>
