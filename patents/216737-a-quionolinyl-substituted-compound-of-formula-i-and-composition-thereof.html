				<td>NEW TRICYCLIC DERIVATIVES AS LTD4 ANTAGONISTS<br>
The present invention relates to new therapeutically useful tricyclic derivatives, to processes for their preparation and to pharmaceutical compositions containing them. These compounds are potent leukotriene D4 antagonists and are thus useful in the treatment, prevention or suppression of pathological conditions, diseases and disorders known to be susceptible of being improved by inhibition of the biological effects of leukotriene D4.<br>
Leukotrienes are compounds produced in mammals by the metabolism of arachidonic acid trough the lipoxygenase pathway. The different leukotrienes are designated by letter-number combinations, such as the non-peptide leukotriene B4 (LTB4), and the peptide-leukotrienes C4 (LTC4), D4 (LTD4) and E4 (LTE4).<br>
Leukotrienes participate in inflammatory reactions, exhibit chemotactic activities, stimulate lysosomal enzyme release and play an important role in the intermediate hypersensitivity reaction. Their biology is described in several reviews, for example Dahlen et al., Nature, 288, 484 (1980)) describe that LTD4 is a potent bronchoconstrictor of the human bronchi and Burke et al., J. Pharmacol. And Exp. Therap., 221, 235 (1982) describe that it is a potent coronary vasoconstrictor and influences contractile force in the myocardium and coronary flow rate of the isolated heart.<br>
In view of their physiological effects, LTD4 antagonists of varied chemical structures have been recently disclosed for the treatment or prevention of pathological conditions, diseases and disorders known to be susceptible to amelioration by inhibition of LTD4 such as bronchial asthma, allergic and perennial rhinitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, urticaria, atopic dermatitis, migraine, viral broncholitis caused by RSV, cystic fibrosis, eosinophilic gastro-enteritis, fibromyalgia A and interstitial cystitis. See, for example EP 0 173 516, EP 0 463 638, EP 0 490 648, US 5.856.322, HEADACHE, (2000 Feb) 40 (2) 158-63, Dermatology, (2001) 203 (4) 280-3. Ref: 51, International Journal of Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics, (2001 Dec) 39 (12) 529-33, Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology, (2001 Jan) 44 (1) 89-93, Annals of Pharmacotherapy, (1997 Sep) 31 (9) 1012-21. Ref: 43, Pulmonary Pharmacology and Therapeutics, (2000) 13 (6) 301-5, American Journal of physiology. Lung Cellular and Molecular Physiology (2002 May) 282 (5) L1143-50, Respirology, (2000 Dec) 5 (4) 389-<br>

Ref: 168, Acta Odontologica Scandinavica, (2001 Dec) 59 (6) 348-55.<br>
A few compounds having a leukotriene D4 antagonistic action have reached the market place. For example 1-[[[(1R-1-[3-[(1E)-2-(7-chloro-2-quinolinyl) ethenyl] phenyl]-3-[2-(1-hydroxy-1-methylethyl) phenyl] propyl] thio] methyl] cyclopropaneacetic acid (Montelukast ex. Merck; Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1995, 5, 283), [3-[[2-methoxy-4-[[[(2-methylphenyl) sulfonyl] amino] carbonyl] phenyl] methyl]-1-methyl-1H-indol-5-yl] carbamic acid cyclopentyl ester (Zafirlukast ex. AstraZeneca; J. Med. Chem. 1990, 33,1781) or N-[4-oxo-2-(1H-tetrazol-5-yl)-4H-1-benzopyran-8-yl]-4-(4-phenylbutoxy)benzamide (Pranlukast ex. Ono; J. Med. Chem. 1988, 31, 84).<br>
We have now found that a novel series of tricyclic derivatives are potent leukotriene D4 antagonists and are therefore useful in the treatment or prevention of pathological conditions, diseases and disorders known to be susceptible of amelioration by inhibition of LTD4, such as bronchial asthma, allergic and perennial rhinitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, urticaria, atopic dermatitis, migraine, viral broncholitis caused by RSV, cystic fibrosis, eosinophilic gastro-enteritis, fibromyalgia A and interstitial cystitis.<br>
The compounds of the present invention can also be used in combination with other drugs known to be effective in the treatment of these diseases. For example, in combination with triptans or COX-2 inhibitors in the treatment of migraine; with H1 antagonists in the treatment of allergic disorders, such as rhinitis or urticaria; or with PDE IV inhibitors in the treatment of allergic disorders, asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides novel compounds of formula (I)<br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof wherein:<br>
from one to three of Ai, A2, A3 and A4 are nitrogen atoms, the others being -CRr groups;<br>
gt represents a group selected from -CH2-O-, -CH2-CH2-, -CH=CH-, -CH2-S-, -N(C.,-C4 alkyl )-CH2;<br>
G2 represents a group selected from -O-CH2-, -CH=CH-, -CH2-CH2-;<br>
each of rl R2, R3 and R4 is the same or different and is selected from hydrogen or halogen atoms and hydroxy, alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, alkoxy, alkylthio, amino, monoalkyamino, dialkylamino, nitro, cyano, acyloxy, alkoxycarbonyl, hydroxycarbonyl and acylamino groups, the hydrocarbon chains of these groups being optionally substituted by one or more further substituents selected from halogen, hydroxy, oxo, alkoxy, alkylthio, acylamino, phenyl, alkoxycarbonyl, amino, monoalkylamino, dialkylamino and hydroxycarbonyl groups,<br>
n, m and p are independently 0,1 or 2<br>

For the avoidance of doubt, the orientation of the group G2 is such that the right hand side of the depicted moieties are attached to the quinoline moiety. Thus, for example, when<br>
G2 is -O-CH2-, the C atom is attached to the quinoline moiety. Similarly, the orientation of the group Gi is such that the right hand side of the depicted moieties are attached to the benzene ring. Thus, for example, when d is -CH2-O-, the O atom is attached to the benzene ring.<br>
Also, when the Y groups contain more than one moiety, the orientation of the Y groups is such that the first named moiety is attached to the S atom and the last named moiety is attached to the Z group. Thus, for example, when Y is alkyl-cycloalkyl, -SYZ is -S-alkyl-cycloalkyl-Z.<br>

In another aspect the present invention encompasses a synthetic process for the preparation of the compounds of formula (I) which is depicted in Scheme 1 and involves<br>
the synthesis of the products of the invention through an intermediate alcohol of formula (III) which is reacted with a mercaptane compound to yield the products of formula (I).<br>
In still another aspect the present invention encompasses intermediate compounds of formula (III) useful in the synthesis of compounds of formula (I).<br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
Particular executions of the general process depicted in Scheme 1 are depicted in Schemes 2 to 5 showing the synthesis of compounds of the invention. When Z = COORs or CONR5RS the compounds (II) can be prepared according to Schemes 2 or 12; when Z = 5-tetrazolyl the route for the preparation of the compounds (V) is depicted in Scheme 3. In the case Z = NHSO2Rs or CONHSO2R5 the synthetic pathway to the compounds (VII) and (IX) is represented in Schemes 4 and 5, respectively.<br>
Reaction scheme 2<br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
Following Scheme 2 the compounds (II) may be synthesised from the alcohols (III) via the trifluoroacetates (prepared in situ with trifluoroacetic acid or anhydride) or the chlorides (prepared with thionyl chloride). This reaction is carried at a temperature between 0° C and 70° C in an organic solvent, preferably a halogenated one and, more preferably, dichloromethane. The product (II) will be obtained as an ester (R5 = alkyl) if a mercaptoester is used and as a carboxylic acid (R5=H) when a mercaptocarboxylic acid is used. Should it be desired to hydrolise the esters (II), R5 = alkyl to the corresponding acids (II), R = H this could be achieved preferably under alkaline conditions (i.e. using alkali hydroxides) in an organic solvent/water system at a temperature between 10°C and 70°C. Among the organic solvents, THF, dioxane or alkanols are preferred.<br>
Compounds in which Z is -CONRsR5 can be prepared by converting the corresponding acid to an acyl chloride by known techniques and subsequent reaction of the acyl chloride<br>
with an amine. For example, they can be prepared by reaction of an amine NHRSR5, with the acyl chloride derived from the corresponding acid (II).<br>
Reaction Scheme 3<br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
Scheme 3 shows two alternative methods for the preparation of the tetrazolyl derivatives. In a fist method (shown on the left hand side of the scheme) the nitriles (IV) are prepared from the alcohols (III) in a very similar way to that described for the esters (II), but using mercaptonitriles instead of the corresponding mercaptoesters. The tetrazoles (V) are prepared from the nitriles (IV) using an azide compound such an alkali metal azide or an<br>
organotin azide, with the optional addition of an acidic compound such as a Lewis acid or an ammonium salt. This reaction can be carried with or without solvent at a temperature between 25°C and 150°C.<br>
In an alternative method (shown on the right hand side of the scheme) the tetrazolyl compounds (V) are obtained in a single step from the alcohols (III) by reaction with the tetrazolyl mercaptanes in conditions very similar to those described for the step leading from compounds (III) to compounds (IV).<br>
Reaction Scheme 4 (Figure Remove)<br><br>
Following the method depicted in Scheme 4, the amino compounds (VI) are prepared using a similar methodology to that described for esters (II) or nitriles (IV), but using a mercaptoamine hydrochloride instead of the corresponding mercaptoesters or mercaptonitriles. The suifonamides (VII) can be synthesised from the amine (VI) obtained in the previous step by direct acylation with a sulfonyl halide or anhydride in the presence of an acid scavenger such as a tertiary amine. This reaction is carried out in an inert solvent such as THF, DMF or CI2CH2, at a temperature between 0°C and 100°C.<br>
Reaction Scheme 5<br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
Following the method depicted in Scheme 5, the carboxylic acids (II) are first transformed to an activated form (VIII) such as an acyl halide or imidazolide. This intermediate is then reacted with a sulfonamide under alkaline conditions to yield the acylsulfonamide (IX).<br>
The synthetic routes to the compounds (I) of the present invention presented so far make use of an alcohol of formula (III) as starting material. The alcohols of formula (III) may be synthesised following a number of alternative processes.<br>
The alternative synthetic routes for the alcohols (III) share a step where the alcohols are obtained by reduction of the corresponding ketones (X) by means of reduction by known methods, such as treatment with sodium borohydride in lower alcohols or their mixtures with THF at temperatures between 0°C and 25°C.<br>
Depending on the nature of the group G2 a number of synthetic routes may be used for the preparation of the ketones (X). Schemes 6 and 7 may be followed when G2 is -O-CH2, Scheme 8 may be followed when G2 is either-CH2-CH2- or-CH=CH-, Scheme 9 may be followed when G2 is -CH=CH- and finally Scheme 10 may be used when both G1 and G2 are -CH2-CH2-.<br>
Reaction Scheme 6<br>
SCHEME 6<br>
 (Figure Remove)<br><br>
Scheme 6 may be followed when G2 is -O-CH2. In this case the ketones (X) may be prepared, by alkylation of the corresponding phenols (XI) with 2-halomethylquinolines, which are obtained by halogenation of quinaldines as described in J. Med. Chem. (1992), 35, 3822-3844.<br>
The reaction of alkylation of the phenols (XI) to give the compounds (X) is carried out in the presence of an alkali carbonate, such as potassium or caesium carbonate, or alternatively by first preparing the salt of the phenol by means of a metal alkoxide, sodium<br>
hydride or another basic agent. This reaction can be effected in a variety of solvents, such as DMF, aliphatic ketones, etc in a range of temperatures between 0°C and 100°C,<br>
The phenols (XI) are prepared from the corresponding methoxy derivatives (XII) by known methods such as treatment with Lewis acids as boron tribromide or protic acids such as hydrobromic acid, as showed in Scheme 7a or following the synthetic route showed in Scheme 7b.<br>
Reaction Scheme 7a<br>
The demethylation reaction from (XII) to (XI) represented in Scheme 7 can be carried in a halogenated solvent in a range of temperatures from -60°C to 30°C (with Lewis acids) or with hydrobromic acid at 100-150°C.<br>
The methoxy derivatives (XII) are prepared according to methods known in the literature; for example, in Synthesis, 1997(1), 113-116; J. Med. Chem., 1995, 38 (3), 496-507; DD 80449 (CA 76, 85803); Arzneim.-Forsch. (1972), 22(1), 133-7.<br>
Reaction Scheme 7b<br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
According to this synthetic scheme, compound (XXV) (which may be obtained according to DD 80449; CA 76:85803) is nitrated to the corresponding nitro derivative (XXVI) with the aid of a nitrating agent, for example with an alkali metal nitrate in sulphuric acid medium, at a temperature between -20 and 25°C. The nitro derivative (XXVI) is then reduced to the amine (XXVII) for example, with tin (II) chloride in acetic acid in a range of temperatures between 30 and 120°C. The amine (XXVII) is transformed into the phenol (XI) through the corresponding diazonium salt which is prepared by treating the amine in acidic media for example, acetic acid, with sodium nitrite, at temperatures between 5 and 40°C. The decomposition of the diazonium salt is effected 'in situ' typically at reflux temperature.<br>
Reaction Scheme 8<br>
 (Figure Remove)<br>
The synthesis of (X) when G2 is different from -O-CH2- and G1 is -CH2-0- or -CH2-S- is achieved through cyclization of the compound (XIII), as depicted in step 3 of synthetic Scheme 8. Compounds (XIII) are synthesised by reacting a phenol orthiophenol (XIV) with a benzyl halide (XV) as shown in step 2 of Scheme 8. The phenols or thiophenols (XIV), are in turn prepared from the corresponding quinaldines by reaction with 4-hydroxy benzaldehyde (XIX) (when G2 is -CH=CH-) or with 4-benzyloxybenzyl chloride (XX) followed by subsequent debenzylation (when G2 is -CH2-CH2-) represented in step 1 of scheme 8.<br>
The quinaldines (XVI) are, in turn, prepared according to J. Heterocycl. Chem (1993), 301(1), 17-21.<br>
In Scheme 8, the step involving condensation between quinaldines (XVI) and p-methoxybenzaldehyde (XIX) is carried out in xylene and acetic anhydride as condensing agent, at a range of temperatures between 100 and 200°C, and implies an ulterior alkaline hydrolysis of the phenyl acetate formed.<br>
The reaction between the quinaldines (XVI) and the p-benzyloxybenzyl chloride (XX) involves the presence of a strong base, such as lithium diisopropylamide, and is typically carried out in THF as solvent, at a range of temperatures between -60°C and 50°C.<br>
The subsequent reaction involves the alkylation of the phenols or thiophenols (XIV) with the benzyl bromides (XV) and is effected in the presence of an alkali carbonate, such as potassium or caesium carbonate, or preparing first the salt of the phenol by means of a metal alkoxide, sodium hydride or another basic agent. This reaction can be effected in a variety of solvents, such as DMF, aliphatic ketones, etc in a range of temperatures between 0°C and 100°C.<br>
The cyclization of the acids derivatives (XIII) to the ketones (X) can also be effected in a variety of ways, for example, forming first an active anhydride with trifluoroacetic anhydride and then treating it with a Lewis acid such as boron trifluoride, or by direct treatment with a condensing agent, such as polyphosphoric acid. The reaction is carried out in halogenated solvents or without solvent, in a range of temperatures between 50°C and150°C.<br>
Reaction Scheme 9<br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
The synthesis of (III) or (X) when G2 is -CH=CH- can also be achieved trough a coupling reaction between an appropriate halo or trifluoromethansulfonyl (triflate) derivative (XVII) and a 2-vinyl quinoline (XVIII), as shown in Scheme 9.<br>
The coupling reaction shown in Scheme 9 is carried on the bromo derivatives which may be prepared according to the literature methods, like those described in WO 89/10369, J. Heterocycl. Chem. (1986), 23, 257 or J. Med. Chem. (1995), 38, 496 or on the<br>
trifluromethansulfonyl derivatives which may be prepared from the phenol derivatives (XI). The coupling reaction is catalysed with palladium salts and triarylphosphines and is run in an inert solvent such as dimethylformamide, THF or dioxane, at a temperature between 25 and 200°C.<br>
Reaction Scheme 10<br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
The synthesis of (X) when both G1 and G2 are -CH2-CH2- is achieved through cyclization of the compound (XXIV), as depicted in step 3 of synthetic Scheme 10. Compounds (XXIV) are synthesised by reacting an aldehyde (XXII) with an o-methyl (aza)benzoate (XXIII) as shown in step 2 of Scheme 10. The aldehydes (XXII), are in turn prepared from the corresponding quinaldines (XVI) by reaction with o-chloromethyl benzaldehides (XXI) as represented in step 1 of scheme 10.<br>
The quinaldines (XVI) are, in turn, prepared according to J. Heterocycl. Chem (1993), 301(1), 17-21.<br>
In Scheme 10, the step involving condensation between quinaldines (XVI) and o-chloromethyl benzaldehides (XXI) is carried out in the presence of a strong base, such as lithium diisopropylamine, and is typically carried out in THF as solvent, at a range of temperatures between -60°C and 50°C.<br>
The subsequent reaction involves the condensation of the aldehydes (XXII) with an o-methyl (aza)benzoate (XXIII) and is effected in the presence of acetic anhydride at a temperature range between 100°C and 200°C, typically at reflux temperature.<br>
The cyclization of the acid derivatives (XXIV) to the ketones (X) can also be effected in a variety of ways, for example, forming first an active anhydride with trifluoroacetic anhydride and then treating it with a Lewis acid such as boron trifluoride, or by direct treatment with a condensing agent, such as polyphosphoric acid. The reaction is carried out in halogenated solvents or without solvent, in a range of temperatures between 50°C and 150°C.<br>
Reaction Scheme 11<br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
The synthesis of (X) when G2 is -CH2-CH2- and G1 is -NR-CH2- is achieved through the synthetic route showed in Scheme 11.<br>
The aldehydes (XXVIII) are prepared according to J.Med.Chem., 1992, 35(21), 3832.<br>
These aldehydes are transformed into the amines (XXIX) via reductive alkylation in alcoholic medium (typically methanol or ethanol) using sodium borohydride as reducing agent at a range of temperatures between 5 and 30°C.<br>
The reaction of the amines (XXIX) with the chlorinated carboxylic acids (XXX) in a high boiling solvent as chlorobenzene at a range of temperatures between 100 and 140°C gives the intermediate carboxylic acids (XXXI).<br>
The carboxylic acids (XXXI) are reacted with a chlorinating agent such as thionyl chloride or oxalyl chloride with or without solvent (typically a chlorinated solvent) at a range of temperatures between 10 and 50°C to yield the corresponding acyl chlorides (XXXII).<br>
Finally the acyl chlorides (XXXII) are cyclized to the ketones (X) with the aid of a Lewis acid catalyst, typically aluminium chloride, in a usual solvent for the Friedel-Crafts reaction, as carbon disulfide or a chlorinated one, in a range of temperatures between 0 and 50°C. Reaction Scheme 12<br>
SCHEME 12<br>
As it has been said, the compounds of the present invention can exist in two enantiomeric forms. The processes described in Schemes 2 to 4 can be modified to allow the synthesis of the enantiomeric forms. The modification consists in that a mercaptan compound having a chiral centre is used to thioetherify the hydroxyl group of the tricyclic alcohols (III). The compound having a chiral centre has the general formula (XXXV)<br>
where Y' stands for a radical as defined under Y in which one hydrogen atom from one of the carbon atoms has been replaced by an amino group to yield a compound having a specific stereoisomery at the carbon atom whose hydrogen has been replaced. The use of compound (XXXV) having a chiral centre allows the preparation of compounds (II), (V), (VII), (IX) having two chiral centres: one at the carbon bearing the sulphur atom of the tricyclic ring system and another at the chiral carbon atom of the radical Y' as shown below:<br>
(Figure Remove)<br><br>
The co-existence of the two chiral centres generates four different diastereomers that can be separated by conventional physical techniques such as crystallization or chromatography. After separation, the amino group is removed by deamination using techniques known in the art.<br>
This yields the chiral compounds:<br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
An example of this synthetic route for the case where Z= COOR5 is depicted in Scheme 12. In this case deamination can be effected by direct deamination of the amino group with hydroxylamine O-sulphonic acid in basic aqueous medium as described in J.Am.Chem.Soc. 1978, 341-2 or with samarium (II) iodide as described in Chem.Commun. 1999,1065-6. The deamination can also be run through reduction of the corresponding diazo derivative by means of hydroiodic acid (J.Am.Chem.Soc. 1943, 65, 1516; J.Chem.Soc. 1954, 3617) or tributyltin hydride (Tetrahedron 2000, 56(38), 7457-<br>
7461; Bull.Korean Chem.Soc. 1993,14(6), 664-5). Another strategy consists in the reduction of the diazo derivative to the corresponding hydrazone by means of sodium borohydride in an organic solvent, preferably THF, and its posterior reduction of the methylene by treatment with a base, preferably a tertiary amine like DBU or N-methylmorpholine. The diazo derivative is prepared from the corresponding amino compound (XXXIII) by treatment with an alkyl nitrite, preferably isoamyl nitrite, in an inert solvent, preferably chloroform or dichloromethane, and in the presence of an organic acid, preferentially acetic acid, as described in Tetrahedron Lett. 1971, 47, 4495-8. Alternatively, the amino derivatives (XXXIII) can be converted to the corresponding isonitriles via formamides with phosphorus oxychloride or diphosgene (J.Chem.Research 1982, 79-80; J.Org.Chem. 1972 (37/2), 187-190) and be subsequently reduced with tributyltin hydride as described in Synthesis 1980, 68-70.<br>

The L-cysteinyl derivative (XXXIII) is prepared from alcohols (III) and L-cysteine ethyl ester hydrochloride in acidic medium. This reaction is carried in very similar conditions to that described for Synthetic Scheme I (trifluoroacetic acid or anhydride or through the corresponding chloro derivative). The corresponding diastereomers of compound (XXXIII) are split by means of crystallisation in a variety of solvents of different range of polarities or through column chromatography on silica gel. The deamination of both isomers of (XXXIII) to the enantiomers (XXXIV) is achieved through any of the alternative routes described above.<br>
PHARMACOLOGICAL ACTIVITY<br>
CysLTI/ LTD4 Binding Protocol (Guinea-pig lung membrane preparation)<br>
Guinea pigs were sacrificed and lung tissues removed. Connective tissue, trachea, large blood vessels and major airways were removed and the remaining tissue, primarily parenchyma, was homogenised in 20 volumes of 10mM TRIS pH 7.4 containing 0.25M sucrose, 0.25 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 155|jg/ml benzenecarboximide, 5ug/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor and 100ug/ml bacitracin (Work Buffer), in a ULTRA-TURRAX T25 at 13500 rpm. The homogenate was centrifuged at 1000 x g for 10 minutes at 4°C. The resulting supernatant was filtered through a sterile cloth and further centrifuged for 15 minutes at 40000 x g at 4°C. The pellet obtained was resuspended in 10 volumes of Work Buffer, homogenised using a Potter (1100 rpm) and subjected to a final centrifugation step for 30 minutes at 40000 x g at 4°C. This membrane pellet was finally resuspended in 10 volumes of 10mM TRIS and 10mM PIPES pH 7.4, and homogenised using a Potter (1100 rpm). Protein concentration was determined by the BRADFORD method using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay kit with BSA as standard. Protein aliquots were kept frozen at -80°C.<br>
Radioligand Binding Assay<br>
[3H]LTD4 (136.9 Ci/mmol) was obtained from NEN.<br>
The assays were performed in a final volume of 250ui of 10mM PIPES pH 7.5 containing 10mM CaCI2, 10mM MgCI2, 50mM NaCI, 2mM L-Cysteine, 2mM Glycine and SOOpM [3H]LTD4. The assay mixture also contained 200ug of lung membrane protein/plate well. Non-specific binding was determined in the presence of zafirlukast 10 uM.<br>
The assays were performed directly on Millipore Multiscreen GF/B plates, presoaked with 200|jl/well of assay buffer at room temperature. Incubations were conducted for 30 minutes at room temperature with continuous shaking. Separation of bound and free [3H]LTD4 was done by filtration through the plates that were then washed three times with 175ul/wash of 10mM TRIS containing 100mM NaCI at 4°C. The plates were dried and counted in a TRILUX Microbeta Liquid Scintillation Counter of Wallac.<br>

LTD4-induced microvascular permeability in guinea-pigs<br>
Male Dunkin-Hartey guinea pigs (450-500 g) fasted for 18 hours were administered the test compounds by oral gavage 4 hours before being anesthetized with urethane (15%, i.p. 10 ml/kg). The left jugular vein was canulated under anaesthesia. Five minutes afterwards, Evans blue dye (40 mg/Kg) was injected intravenously. After five more minutes, LTD4 was administered (1 ug /kg, i.v.) to the animals in order to induce airway microvascular leakage. After yet another period of 5 minutes, animals were exsanguinated by cutting the right atria and the vascular bed was rinsed by perfusing 50 ml of saline solution through the left ventricle at a pressure of 150 cmH2O. Then the trachea was excised and incubated in formamide for 20 hours at 55°C to extract the Evans blue dye from the tissue. Microvascular permeability was determined by light spectrophotometry at 620 nm of the extravasated dye.<br>
