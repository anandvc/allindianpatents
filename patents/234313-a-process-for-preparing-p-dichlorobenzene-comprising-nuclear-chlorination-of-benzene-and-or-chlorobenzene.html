Comparison of the present invention with the above-mentioned prior arts<br>
In the following, the present invention will be illustrated in detail comparing with the prior arts.<br>
EP126669 discloses in Examples 3, 10 and 13, production of p - dichlorobenzene from benzene by reacting 3 mols of benzene with 4.5 mols of chlorine at 60°C for 4.5 hours using a catalyst system consisting of 10 - substituted- 10H -phenothiazine/f erric chloride in<br>
a molar ratio of 1.07 - 1.50 in an amount of 0.12 -0.38 millimols of ferric chloride per mol of benzene, by which nuclear chlorination can be carried out in a para-selectivity of 82.1 - 83.4%.<br>
The term "para -selectivity" herein means a value calculated by the formula {p/(o + p) X100] using value of gas chromatography of o-dichlorobenzene (value: o) and p-dichlorobenzene (value:p) in a reaction mixture after nuclear chlorination.  It is hereinafter referred to as the same meaning.<br>
EP126669 discloses in Example 4 production of p-dichlorobenzene from benzene by reacting 3 mols of benzene with 4.5 mols of chlorine at 60°C for 4.5 hours using a catalyst system consisting of 10 - substituted 10H-phenothiazine/antimony trichloride in a molar ratio of 1.53 in an amount of 0.066 millimols of antimony trichloride per mol of benzene, by which nuclear chlorination can be carried out in the para -selectivity of 82.8%.<br>
EP126669 discloses in Example 5 production of p-dichlorobenzene from chlorobenzene by reacting 6 mols of chlorobenzene with 5 mols of chlorine at 20°C for 5 hours using a catalyst system consisting of 10-substituted-10H-phenothiazine/ferric chloride in a molar ratio of 1.61 in an amount of 1.52 millimols of ferric chloride per mol of benzene, by which nuclear chlorination can be carried out in the para -selectivity of 87.3%.<br>
EP474074 discloses in Examples 1,2,4 and 5<br>
production of p-dichlorobenzene from benzene by reacting 1.28 mols of benzene with 140% by mol of<br>
chlorine at 60°C for 5 hours using a catalyst system consisting of 10 - substituted-10H-phenothiazine/ferric chloride in a molar ratio of 1.0 in an amount of 0.24 millimols of ferric chloride per mol of benzene, by which nuclear chlorination can be carried out in the para-selectivity of 81.3 - 83.0%.<br>
EP474074 discloses in Example 3 production of p-dichlorobenzene from benzene by reacting 1.28 mols of benzene with 140% by mol of chlorine at 20°C for 5 hours using a catalyst system consisting of 10-substituted-1 OH -phenothiazine/ferric chloride in a molar ratio of 1.0 in an amount of 2.46 millimols of ferric chloride per mol of benzene, by which nuclear chlorination can be carried out in the para - selectivity of 86.1%.<br>
EP474074 discloses in Example 6 production of p-dichlorobenzene from benzene by reacting 0.89 mols of benzene with 60% by mol of chlorine at 70°C for 2.5 hours using a catalyst system consisting of 10-substituted-10H-phenothiazine/ferric chloride in a molar ratio of 1.0 in an amount of 0.42 millimols of ferric chloride per mol of benzene, by which nuclear chlorination can be carried out in the para - selectivity of 82.0%.<br>
WO97/43041 discloses in Preparation Example 2 production of p-dichlorobenzene from benzene by reacting 1.92 mols of benzene with chlorine at 60°C for<br>
5.5 hours using a catalyst system consisting of 10-substituted 10H-phenothiazine/ferric chloride in a molar ratio of 1.52 in an amount of 0. 19 millimols of ferric chloride per mol of benzene so as to be 1.59 of chlorination degree (mol number of substituted chlorine atoms per mol of benzene ring), by which nuclear chlorination can be carried out in the para - selectivity of 86%.  It is further described that the para-selectivity of 88% can be obtained when the<br>
chlorination is continued at 60°C for 4.5 hours (a total of 10 hours) so as to be 1.96 of chlorination degree.<br>
WO97/43041 discloses in Preparation Example 7 production of p-dichlorobenzene from benzene by<br>
reacting 1.84 mols of benzene with chlorine at 60°C for 3.5 hours using a catalyst system consisting of 10-substituted 10H-phenothiazine/ferric chloride in a molar ratio of 1.2 in an amount of 0.22 millimols of ferric chloride per mol of benzene so as to be 1.72 of chlorination degree, by which nuclear chlorination can be carried out in a para -selectivity of 86%.<br>
W097/43041 discloses in Preparation Example 1 production of p-dichlorobenzene from benzene by reacting 2.18 mols of benzene with chlorine at 50°C for 7 hours using a catalyst system consisting of 10-substituted 10H-phenothiazine/ferric chloride in a molar ratio of 5.1 in an amount of 1.33 millimols of ferric chloride per mol of benzene so as to be 1.48 of chlorination degree, by which nuclear chlorination can<br>
be carried out in a para - selectivity of 87%.<br>
A matter common to EP126669, EP474074 and W097/43041 (referred to as "prior 3 patents" hereafter) is molar ratio of 10 - substituted-10H-phenothiaz-ine/ferric chloride being 1 or more.<br>
In the prior 3 patents, the reaction temperature in case of using benzene as a starting material is 60°C except for Example 3 of EP474074 being 20°C.<br>
In the prior 3 patents, the reaction temperature<br>
is 20°C in case of Example 5 of EP126669 and Example 3 of EP474074, where the amount of ferric chloride is 1.52 millimols per mol of chlorobenzene (12.7 times of the amount in Example 3 of EP126669) and 2.46 millimols per mol of benzene (10.2 times of the amount in Example 1 of EP474074) and the ratio of substituted- 1 OH -phenothiazine/ferric chloride is 1.6 and 1.0, respectively.  The para - selectivity in Example 5 of EP126669 and that of Example 3 of EP474074 are 87.3% and 86.1% respectively, which are the best in each patent.  These values are realized by reducing the reaction temperature and increasing an amount of the catalyst.  The reason of it is believed that the reaction time does not remarkably increase even though the reaction temperature is low.<br>
The reason why the reaction time is the same or up to only 11% increase, which means no remarkable increase in reaction time, in spite of reducing the reaction temperature, is believed to be based on the effect of increasing the amount of the catalyst.<br>
In Example 6 of EP474074, the amount of ferric chloride is 0.42 millimols per mol of chlorobenzene (1.7 times of the amount in Example 1 of EP474074) and the ratio of substituted-10H-phenothiazine/ferric chloride is 1.0.  The reaction is carried out at the reaction temperature of 70°C for 2.5 hours, by which 60% by mol of chlorine is reacted to benzene.  Although the reaction time becomes one a half by increasing the<br>
amount of the catalyst and elevating 10°C the reaction temperature, the para -selectivity is only 82.0%.<br>
In Preparation Example 7 of W097/43041, it is described that nuclear chlorination in the para-selectivity of 86% can be carried out by chlorinating<br>
benzene at 60°C for 3.5 hours using a catalyst system consisting of 10 - substituted-10H-phenothiazine/ferric chloride in a molar ratio of 1.2 in an amount of 0.22 millimols per mol of benzene so as to be chlorination degree of 1.72.  However, the reason why the reaction time becomes as short as 3.5 hours is not disclosed. Preparation Example 7 is distinctly different from Preparation Example 2 in a viewpoint that a part of the reaction mixture after reacting 7 hours in Preparation Example 12 has been used as a catalyst.  Therefore, the reaction time becomes 10.5 hours in Example 7, because the process of Preparation Example 12 is added to the process of Preparation Example T<br>
As be clear from the above-mentioned facts, these prior 3 patents neither disclose nor suggest the present invention, that is, "a process for preparing p-<br>
dichlorobenzene by carrying out nuclear chlorination of benzene and/or chlorobenzene (referred to as "starting material") for the reation time of 1 - 4 hours by chlorine molecules, which comprises chlorinating using aluminum chloride and phenothiazine of the above formula(I) in such an amount that a molar ratio of<br>
[phenothiazine of the above formula(I)/ aluminum chloride] is 0.1 - 0.9 and a ratio by millimol/mol of<br>
[aluminum chloride/starting material] is 0.1 - 3 so as to be a chlorination degree in a range of 1.2 - 2.5.<br>
[Best Modes for Carrying Out the Invention]<br>
Embodiments of the present invention will be illustrated in detail hereafter.<br>
In the present invention, benzene and<br>
chlorobenzene as the starting materials are available on the market or can be prepared by methods described in technical literatures.  It is, however, preferred to use benzene and chlorobenzene after distillation and, more preferably, those obtained by distillation after drying and/or in the presence of a drying agent.  It is preferred to use them as early as possible and, preferably, immediately after distillation.  Benzene and chlorobenzene may be used in a state of a mixture of them.<br>
Aluminum chloride used in the present invention are available on the market.  It may be prepared from metallic aluminum.  The amount of aluminum chloride used is 0.1 - 3 mi Illinois, preferably, 0.2 - 1.5<br>
millimols, and more preferably 0.3 - 1 millimols per mol of benzene and/or chlorobenzene as the starting material.<br>
Phenothiazines represented by the above formula(I) used in the present invention are available on the market.  Alternatively, they can be prepared by methods described in technical literatures.  Phenothiazines of the formula(I) wherein the group A is CF3(CF2)nCO- (n = 0, 1 or 2) can be prepared by, for example, a method described in Japanese Patent Application Laid-open HEI 9-301939 or by similar methods.  Phenothiazines of the formula(I) wherein the group A is a substituted or unsubstituted phenoxycarbonyl of the formula(II) can be prepared by, for example, a method described in W097/43041 or a method according to it.<br>
Examples of phenothiazines represented by the formula include, as preferable phenothiazines, 10-chlorocarbonyl-lOH-phenothiazine, 10-dichloroacetyl-lOH-phenothiazine, 2-chloro-10-chlorocarbonyl-10H-phenothiazine, 10-trifluoroacetyl-10H-phenothiazine, 10-pentafuluoropropionyl-10H-phenothiazine, 10-heptafluorobutyroyl-lOH-phenothiazine, 1 OH -phenothiazine-10 -carboxylic acid phenyl ester, 10H-phenothiazine-10 -carboxylic acid 4 -chlorophenyl ester, 10H-phenothiazine-10 -carboxylic acid 4-methylphenyl ester, 10H-phenothiazine- 10 -carboxylic acid 4-methoxyphenyl ester, 2 -chloro-10H-phenothiazine-10-carboxylic acid phenyl ester, and nuclear chlorinated lOH-phenothiazine-10-carboxylic acid phenyl ester.<br>
The amount of the phenothiazine represented by the above formula(I) is in a range of 0.1 - 0.9 mols, preferably 0.2 - 0.8 mols and more preferably 0.3 - 0.7 mols .<br>
In the present invention, nuclear chlorination is carried out using a necessary or excess amount of gaseous or liquid chlorine so as to be a desired chlorination degree.  The chlorination degree is 1.2 -2.5, preferably 1.3 - 2.2 and more preferably 1.4 - 2.<br>
The nuclear chlorination reaction in the present invention may be carried out, if desired, in a reaction solvent.  As the reaction solvent, halogenated hydrocarbons such as dichlorobenzene, 1,2-dichloroethane, 1,2 -dichloropropane, dichloromethane, chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, etc. can be used.<br>
The reaction temperature in the present invention is preferably in a range of 30 - 80°C, more preferably 40 - 70°C and particularly 45 - 55°C.<br>
The reaction time in the present invention is in a range of 1 - 4 hours, preferably 1 - 3.5 hours and particularly 1.5 - 3.2 hours.<br>
The nuclear chlorination is performed under such a condition that the para - selectivity of the resulted reaction mixture becomes preferably 83% or more, more preferably 85% or more, and particularly 86% or more, by combining the above-mentioned reaction conditions.<br>
The process for preparing p-dichlorobenzene according to the present invention is characterized, as mentioned above, by carrying out the reaction using a<br>
catalyst system consisting of aluminum chloride and phenothiazine represented by the formula(I).  However, it is possible to use a method comprising taking out a product from the reaction mixture after nuclear chlorination of benzene and/or chlorobenzene as the starting material by distillation, and repeatedly carrying out nuclear chlorination by adding benzene and/or chlorobenzene to the residue as the catalyst system, or a method comprising carrying out nuclear chlorination by adding a part of the reaction mixture as the catalyst system to benzene and/or chlorobenzene. In these process of the present invention, the aluminum chloride and/or phenothiazine represented by the formula(I) may be added on the way of the reaction step<br>
