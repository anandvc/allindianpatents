The present invention is concerned with a process for the manufacture of a polyene aldehyde or polyene dialdehyde from acetalised short-chain polyene (di)aldehydes by an acid-catalyzed condensation reaction with alkoxydienes.<br>
Lewis acid-catalyzed additions of a, p-unsaturated ethers (enol ethers) to acetals have been known for a long time and date back to the work of Muller-Cunradi and Pieroh (see US Patent 2,165,962). Hoaglin and Hirsch [J.A.C.S. 71, 3468 (1949)] investigated this reaction further and broadened the possible applications, which Isler et al. likewise did in the nineteen fifties, namely with respect to the synthesis of p-carotene, crocetin diaidehyde, lycopene as well as p-apocarotenoids [see Helv. Chim. Acta 39, 249 et seq. and 463 et seq. (1956), ibid. 42, 854 et seq. (1959) as well as US Patents 2,827,481 and 2,827,482]. Later, Mukaiyama [Angew. Chem. 89, 858 et seq. (1977) and Org. Reactions 28, 203 et seq. (1982)] extended the reaction by using the advantageous and readily accessible trimethylsilyl enol ethers.<br>
The first Lewis acid-catalyzed condensations of 1-alkoxy- 1,3-dienes (dienol ethers) with a, p-unsaturated acetals were reported by Nazarov and Krasnaya [J. Gen. Chem. USSR 28, 2477 et seq. (1958)] and by Makin [Pure &amp; Appl. Chem. 47, 173 et seq. (1976), J. Gen. Chem. USSR 31, 3096 et seq. (1961) and 32, 3112 et seq. (1962)]. Here, the coupling of the acetal to the dienol ether takes place as far as can be seen exclusively at its (y-position with the formation of a chain-lengthened a,p-unsat-urated acetal, which, however, in competition with the first acetal reacts with further dienol ether with the formation of a further, chain-lengthened a, p-unsaturated acetal etc. [telomer formation; see also Chemla et al., Bull. Soc. Chim. Fr. 130, 200 et seq. (1993)]. For this reason such a condensation has been found not to be workable for synthetic purposes, especially for the<br><br>
synthesis of apocarotenoids [Isler et al., Adv. Org. Chem. 4, 115 et seq. (1963)].<br>
Not   only   1 -alkoxy-1,3-dienes,   but  also  trimethylsilyloxy-dienes [of the type CH2=CH-CH=CH-OSi(CH3)3] can be condensed with ot,p-unsaturated acetals in the presence of Lewis acid<br>
catalysts, as disclosed by Mukaiyama et al. in Chem. Lett. 1975, 319 et seq.    In this coupling too the attack seems to take place exclusively at the terminal (y-) carbon atom of the diehe system to form "Y-Proclucts" [see Mukaiyama et al., Bull. Chem. Soc. Jap<br>
50. 1161  et seq. (1977) and Japanese Patent Publication (Kokai) 36,  645/1977].     In contrast to the  reaction with  1-alkoxy-1,3-dienes, from which an oc,p-unsaturated acetal is produced, the<br>
reaction  of trimethylsilyloxydienes  with  acetals  affords  an aldehyde which cannot react further with the diene (no telomer formation).    By using this method Mukaiyama et al. were able to synthesize vitamin A [see Kokai 36, 645/1977, Chem. Lett. 1975, 1201 et seq. and Bull. Chem. Soc. Japan 51, 2077 et seq. (1978)] and workers from Rhone-Poulenc developed new routes to carotenoids and vitamin A (see DOS 2,701,489 and A.E.C. Societe de Chimie Organique et Biologique No. 7824350).<br>
The aforementioned Lewis acid-catalyzed condensation of a dienol ether with an a,p-unsaturated acetal based on the works of<br>
Nazarov and Krasnaya, Makin as well as Chemla et al. would be a very valuable access to apocarotenals and bis-apocarotenals if the yields of the desired primary product of the type ...CH=CH-CH(OalkyP)-CH2-CH=CH-CH(Oalky|i)(Oalky|2) could be<br>
increased and the telomer formation could be suppressed.   Thus, the desired polyene aldehyde of the type<br>
...CH=CH-CH=CH-CH=CH-CHO could be obtained from this primary product by hydrolysis of the acetal group C(OalkyI1)(OaIkyl2) and elimination  of  alkyl1OH.    In addition to the fact that in this reaction the formation of the double bond takes place under catalytic conditions,  no  phosphorus-,  silicon- or sulphur-containing reagents are required.<br><br>
The object of the present invention is to manufacture chain-lengthened polyene aldehydes or dialdehydes starting from polyene acetals or diacetals while avoiding as far as possible the aforementioned disadvantages of the state of the art and replacing the Wittig, Horner or Julia reaction hitherto used for this purpose.<br>
This object is achieved in accordance with the invention by reacting a polyene 0,0-dialkyl acetal or di(0,0-dialkyl acetal) with a 1-alkoxy-1,3-diene in the presence of a suitable catalyst, namely a Lewis acid or Bronsted acid, to give the corresponding chain-lengthened  8-alkoxy-ot,p-unsaturated polyene aldehyde or di(8-alkoxy-ot,p-unsaturated) polyene dialdehyde in the form of its acetal or diacetal,  hydrolyzing this di(acetal) to the corresponding di(aldehyde) and finally eliminating the 8-positioned alkanol from the thus-formed (di)aldehyde under basic or acidic conditions in order to obtain the desired (conjugated) polyene (di)aldehyde.    Not only is the reaction of the 1-alkoxy-1,3-diene with the polyene 0,0-dialkyl acetal or di(0,0-dialkyl acetal) novel, but surprisingly it takes place (so far as can be seen) with exclusive attack at the y-position of the alkoxydiene.    By base- or<br>
acid-induced elimination of the alkanol following the hydrolysis a (conjugated) C-C double bond is formed without requiring a phosphorus-, silicon- or sulphur-containing  reagent, which  is in contrast to the methodology hitherto usually used in this field.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention is concerned with a process for the manufacture of a polyene aldehyde or polyene dialdehyde of the general formula<br><br><br>
wherein<br>
A        signifies   a   monovalent,   optionally   methyl-substituted,<br>
conjugated polyene group, B       signifies   a   bivalent,   optionally  methyl-substituted,<br>
conjugated polyene group and R1 and R2 each signify hydrogen or methyl,<br>
with the -CH=CH-C(R1)=C(R2)-CHO group(s) in each case<br>
being situated in the terminal position(s) of the conjugated<br>
chain of group A or B, which process comprises reacting a polyene 0,0-dialkyl acetal or di(0,0-dialkyl acetal) of the general formula<br><br>
wherein<br>
A and B       have the significances given above, with in this case the  -CH(OR3)2 group(s) being situated in the terminal position(s) of the conjugated chain of group A or B, and<br>
R4	signifies   Ci-6-alkyl,<br>
with  a  1-alkoxy-1,3-diene of the general formula<br><br>
wherein<br>
R1 and R2   have the significances given above and<br>
R4	signifies   C-i-6-alkyl,<br>
in the presence of a Lewis acid or Bronsted acid, hydrolyzing the<br>
reaction mixture and cleaving off the alcohol R3OH under basic or<br>
acidic conditions from the thus-produced compound of the general<br>
formula<br><br><br>
wherein<br>
A, B, R1, R2 and R3 have the significances given above, with in this case the -CH(OR3)-CH2-C(R1)=C(R2)-CHO group(s) being situated in the terminal position(s) of the conjugated chain of group A or B.<br>
The process in accordance with the invention can in principle be used in the case of all of the aforementioned polyene 0,0-dialkyl acetals of formula II' or polyene di(0,0-dialkyl acetals) of formula M" which have the acetal group -CH(OR3)2 at the end or at both ends of the polyene chain.   Among such educts there are to be found, inter alia, the following sub-classes [with the abbreviated form of presentation which is usual in carotenoid chemistry (using simple lines) being used for the structural formulae]:<br>
Alicyclic-aliphatic  polyene  0,0-dialkyl   acetals,   which mainly belong to the carotenoid field [as acetals of asymmetric carotenoid aldehydes having a six-membered (cyclohexene) ring], of the general formula<br><br>
wherein<br>
R3      has the significance given above and<br><br>
R5 and R6 each independently signify hydrogen, an optionally protected hydroxy group or an optionally protected oxo group, m       signifies 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4 and n        signifies 0 or 1,<br>
which, after carrying out the multistage process in accordance with the invention, are converted into the corresponding alicyclic-aliphatic polyene aldehydes of the  general formula<br><br>
aliphatic  polyene  0,0-dialkyl  acetals,  which  likewise mainly belong to the carotenoid field (as acetals of open-chain asymmetric carotenoid aldehydes), of the general formula<br><br>
wherein<br>
R3      has the significance given above and<br>
p        signifies 0, 1  or 2,<br>
q        signifies 0, 1, 2 or 3 and<br>
n        signifies 0 or 1,<br>
which, after carrying out the multistage process in accordance<br>
with the invention, are converted into the corresponding aliphatic<br>
polyene aldehydes of the general formula<br><br><br>
f<br>
aliphatic  polyene  di(OfO-dialkyl  acetals),  which  likewise mainly belong to the carotenoid field (as acetals of symmetrical carotenoid dialdehydes), of the general formula<br><br>
wherein<br>
R3      has the significance given above and<br>
r        signifies 0, 1 or 2 and<br>
n        signifies 0 or 1,<br>
which, after carrying out the multistage process in accordance<br>
with the invention, are converted into the corresponding aliphatic<br>
polyene dialdehydes of the general formula<br><br>
The educts of general formulae lla, Mb and lie can be embraced by general formula II:<br><br>
wherein<br>
R     signifies a group (a), (b) or (c)<br><br><br><br>
and R3, R5 &gt; R6, m, n, p, q and r have the significances given above.<br>
After carrying out the multistage process in accordance with the invention the educt of formula II is converted into the corresponding product of formula I:<br><br>
Formula I then embraces formulae la, lb and Ic.<br>
Where the product of formula I, especially of formula la, has one or two protected groups (R5, R6) on the cyclohexene ring, the protecting group(s) present can, if desired, be cleaved off, which represents a further aspect of the present invention.<br>
In the scope of the present invention the term "Ci.6-alkyl" embraces straight-chain and branched groups such as, for example, methyl, ethyl and isobutyl.<br>
The term "protected hydroxy group" embraces usual protected hydroxy groups (especially those which are familiar from  the carotenoid field),  particularly etherified  hydroxy groups and acyloxy groups.    The "etherified hydroxy groups" are, for example,  C-|.5-alkoxy groups, preferably methoxy and ethoxy; C2-16-alkoxyalkoxy   groups,   preferably   1 -methoxy-1 -methylethoxy;<br><br>
arylalkoxy  groups,  preferably  benzyloxy;  tetrahydropyranyloxy; and  tri(C-|-5-alkyl)silyloxy   groups,   preferably   trimethylsilyloxy. The acyloxy groups embrace especially alkanoyloxy and aroyloxy groups with up to 8 carbon atoms such as, for example, formyloxy, acetoxy, propionyloxy and benzoyloxy.<br>
The term "protected oxo group" also embraces usual protected oxo groups (especially those which are familiar from the carotenoid field).    Acetalised oxo groups, especially those where the term protected oxo stands for two C-i-5-alkoxy  groups (e.g. for two methoxy groups) or for a C2-6-alkylenedioxy  group (e.g. ethylenedioxy or 2,3-butylenedioxy, are preferred.    Further, an oxo group can also be protected as an enol ether, primarily in the case of oc-hydroxyketones (e.g. R5 and R6 signify hydroxy or<br>
oxo or vice versa), in which case the etherification of the enediol can preferably also be effected by the formation of a cyclic acetal or ketal (e.g. with acetone to the acetonide).   The oxo group can also be protected, for example, as an imine.<br>
The formulae of polyenes disclosed in the scope of the present invention embrace in each case isomeric forms, e.g. optically active and cis/trans or E/Z isomers, as well as mixtures thereof unless indicated to the contrary.    The carbon atom carrying  R5 or R6 where R5 or R6 signifies an optionally protected hydroxy group (see formulae la and lla) can be mentioned as an example of a chiral (optically active) centre.    With respect to E/Z isomerism, then there are generally preferred the (all-E) isomers of the educts and of the products of the process in accordance with  the   invention.<br>
The first step of the process in accordance with the invention is conveniently carried out by reacting the polyene (di)0,0-dialkyl  acetal of formula  II1 or 11" with the  1-alkoxy-1,3-diene of formula III in an organic solvent at temperatures in the range of about -60°C to about +60°C, preferably in the temperature range of about -20°C to room temperature, and in the presence of a Lewis acid or Bronsted acid.    Suitable organic solvents are, in general, all aprotic polar or non-polar solvents.<br><br>
Preferred among such solvents are lower aliphatic and cyclic hydrocarbons, e.g. n-pentane, n-hexane and cyclohexane; lower, halogenated aliphatic hydrocarbons, e.g. methylene chloride and chloroform;  lower aliphatic and cyclic ethers, e.g. diethyl ether, tert.butyl  methyl  ether and  tetrahydrofuran;  lower aliphatic nitriles, e.g. acetonitrile; as well as aromatics, e.g. toluene,    n-Hexane and toluene are especially preferred solvents.    Examples of Lewis acids which can be used are zinc chloride, zinc bromide, titanium  tetrachloride,   lithium   perchlorate,   boron   trifluoride etherate as well as iron(lll) chloride; and examples of Bronsted acids which can be used are p-toluenesulphonic acid, methane-sulphonic acid, trifluoromethanesulphonic acid, sulphuric acid as well as trifluoroacetic acid.    These are generally used in catalytic amounts, conveniently in an amount of between about 0.5 and 5 mol percent based on the amount of polyene (di)0,0-dialkyl acetal employed and preferably in a mol percent range of 1% to 2%.   Moreover, there are conveniently used about 1.05 to about 1.6 equivalents of 1-alkoxy-1,3-diene per equivalent of polyene 0,0-dialkyl acetal or about 2.1 to about 3.2 equivalents of of  1-alkoxy-1,3-diene per equivalent of polyene di(0,0-dialkyl acetal), preferably about 1.2 to about 1.4 and, respectively, about 2.4 to about 2.8 equivalents.    Moreover, the reaction is conveniently effected at normal pressure, although in general the pressure  is  not critical.<br>
If desired, the intermediate (the compound of formula IV or IV" in the form of its dialkyl acetal) can be isolated from the reaction mixture and subsequently hydrolyzed to the corresponding compound of formula IV or IV".   However, it has been found to be convenient not to undertake such an isolation and subsequent hydrolysis, but to hydrolyze the intermediate in the reaction   mixture   itself  immediately  after completion  of the reaction II'/IP + III in order to proceed to the compound of formula IV or IV"  (hereinafter abbreviated to IV/IV")  in these cases.   The hydrolysis can be suitably effected by adding to the reaction mixture an aqueous solution of a weak acid, preferably slightly diluted aqueous acetic acid, and subsequently stirring the mixture for a time, for example about 30 minutes to about<br><br>
2 hours, conveniently in the temperature range of about 0°C to room  temperature.<br>
The respective product of formula IV or IV" can be isolated from the reaction mixture and, if desired, purified in a manner known per se.    Typically, the mixture is combined with water and the batch is extracted with a water-immiscible organic solvent such as, for example, with a lower alkane, dialkyl ether or aliphatic ester, e.g. n-hexane, tert.butyl methyl ether or ethyl acetate, and the organic phase is washed with water and/or saturated aqueous sodium chloride and/or sodium bicarbonate solution, dried and concentrated.    An alternative involves adding water to the  reaction  mixture  and filtering off the  precipitated product which results from this, washing as in the case of the extract and then drying.    The thus-isolated and at least to some extent washed crude product can then, if desired, be purified further, for example by column chromatography, e.g. using eluents such as n-hexane, ethyl acetate, toluene or mixtures thereof, or (re)crystallization, for example from an alcohol, e.g. methanol or ethanol.    Alternatively, and often preferably, the crude product, taken up, for example, in a lower alkanol, can be reacted directly in the last process step of the present invention, i.e. in the sense of a "through process" 11711" + III -&gt; IV7IV" -» 171".<br>
With respect to the last process step, i.e. the cleavage of the alcohol R3OH from the compound of formula IV or IV", eliminations of alcohols from (3-alkoxyaldehydes  or 5-alkoxy-a,p-<br>
unsaturated aldehydes with the formation of the corresponding a,(3- or a,(3,y,8-unsaturated aldehydes are known in the scientific<br>
literature and can be carried out under a variety of conditions. For example, in the scope of known base-induced eliminations 1,8-diazabicycIo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene is often used as the base in an amount of about 2 to 4 equivalents based on the amount of aldehyde used.   Such conditions are used in the known manufacture of carotenoids [see, inter alia, Bull. Chem. Soc. Japan 50., 1161 et seq. (1977), ibid. 51, 2077 et seq. (1978), Chem. Lett. 1975,  1201  et seq. and German Offenlegungsschrift 2,701,489] and of vitamin A (see, inter alia, Chem. Lett. 1975, 1201 et seq.).<br><br>
Aluminium oxide has also been used in the production of vitamin A by alcohol cleavage [J. Gen. Chem. USSR 32, 63 et seq. (1962)].   As examples of acid-induced alcohol cleavages reference is again made to Bull. Chem. Soc. Japan f&gt;0, 1161 et seq. (1977) and to J. Gen. Chem. USSR 30, 3875 et seq. (1960) in which p-toluene-sulphonic acid and, respectively, 85% phosphoric acid are used as the acid catalyst.    The buffer system sodium acetate/acetic acid [Helv. Chem. Acta. 3S, 249 et seq. and 463 et seq. (1956) and US Patents 2,827,481   and 2,827,482] or sodium formate/formic acid [Synthesis 1981, 137 et seq.] has been used for such a cleavage, especially in the manufacture of carotenoids.    Having regard to this and other relevant literature a person skilled in the art will be readily able to find suitable reaction conditions for the satisfactory performance of the last step of the process in accordance with the invention.<br>
Furthermore, the cleavage of the alcohol R3OH can also be carried out using only catalytic amounts of a base, i.e. with less than one equivalent based on one equivalent of the compound of formula IV or IV".   Thus, the last process step in this case is conveniently carried out by converting the compound of formula IV or IV", dissolved in a suitable organic solvent, in the presence of a catalytic amount of base with cleavage of the alcohol R3OH into the corresponding polyene (di)aldehyde of formula I' or I". Suitable organic solvents are generally protic, aprotic or mixtures thereof such as, for example, alcohols and mixtures of alcohols; or aromatics, e.g. toluene; and lower aliphatic esters, e.g. ethyl acetate.   The base can be inorganic or organic, with strong bases such as, for example, alkali metal alcoholates, e.g. sodium methylate,  sodium ethylate,  potassium methylate, potassium ethylate and potassium tert.butylate; amines, e.g. triethylamine,   1,5-diazabicyclo[4.3.0]non-5-ene   and   1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene;  as well as  alkali  metal hydroxides and carbonates, especially sodium and poassium hydroxide or carbonate, being generally suitable.    As mentioned above, a maximum of one equivalent of base is conveniently used per equivalent of compound of formula IV or IV", preferably about 0.05 to about 0.3 equivalent.    The reaction is suitably effected in<br><br>
the temperature range of about -20°C to about 100°C,  preferably at temperatures of about 0°C to about 50°C. Moreover, the reaction is conveniently effected at normal pressure, although in general the pressure is not critical.<br>
It has been found to be especially advantageous to carry out the last process step using a sodium alkoxide as the base and the corresponding alkanol as the solvent at temperatures between about -20°C and the reflux temperature of the respective reaction mixture, preferably in a temperature range of about 0°C to about 40°C.    Conveniently, either a solution of the sodium alkoxide in the alcohol is prepared in advance or this solution is prepared freshly from metallic sodium and the alkanol.    The bringing together of the alkanolic solution of the sodium alkoxide with the solution of the compound of formula IVVIV" in the (same) alkanol, preferably likewise previously prepared, can be effected in any sequence and preferably at room temperature.   Then, the reaction mixture is subsequently stirred for several hours and the reaction has normally finished at the latest after one to three hours.<br>
Irrespective of the chosen procedure for the last process step, the product can be isolated from the reaction mixture and purified in a manner known per se.   When a basic catalyst is used, the  respective  working-up  normally comprises  neutralization  of the residual base by the addition of an organic or inorganic acid such as, for example, a carboxylic acid, e.g. acetic acid, or an aqueous mineral acid, e.g. dilute sulphuric acid.<br>
In the particular embodiment of the procedure described above using a sodium alkoxide as the base, after completion of the reaction the mixture is conveniently cooled to room temperature or even to about 0°C and thereafter preferably neutralized with aqueous acetic acid.    The crystallization of the product of formula I' or I" can also be expedited by further cooling.    After its isolation,  suitably by filtration, the product can be washed, for example with water and/or aqueous alcohol, and finally dried, optionally under reduced pressure.    If desired, further methods<br><br>
such as, for example, column chromatography and recrystai-lization can be employed in order to provide an even purer product.<br>
If desired, protecting groups (R5 and/or R6 as a protected hydroxy or oxo group) which may be present in the obtained product of formula I' or I" can be cleaved off according to methods known per se, e.g. by hydrolysis with acid or base.<br>
In the process in accordance with the invention defined above R preferably signifies either a group (a) in which R5 and R6 both signify hydrogen and n signifies 0, or a group (c) in which both n's signify 0, and in both cases R1 and R2 preferably signify hydrogen and methyl, respectively.<br>
As mentioned above, in carrying out the process in accordance with the invention there is the advantage over the state of the art (especially the aforementioned works of Nazarov and Krasnaya, Makin as well as Chemla et al.) in that, inter alia, the telomer formation is largely suppressed.    Although in the process in accordance with the invention the telomer formation resulting from the further reaction of the compound of formula IV or IV"  in acetal form with the  1-alkoxy-1,3-diene of formula III cannot always be suppressed completely this is finally much less serious than expected.   The cleavage of the alcohol R3OH from the compound of IV or IV", occurring after the intermediate stage hydrolysis, can be effected readily in the presence of a telomer co-produced in a relatively small amount as a byproduct,<br>
e.g. of the formula A-CH(0R3)-CH2-C(R1)=C(R2)-CH(0R3)-CH2-C(Ri)=C(R2)-CHOor<br>
0HC-(R2)C=(R1)C-H2C-(R30)HC-(R2)C=(R1)C-H2C-(R30)HC-B-CH(0R3)-CH2-C(R1)=C(R2).CH(0R3)-CH2-C(R1)=C(R2)-CH0 (in each case a single additional reaction), with an analogous alcohol cleavage from the telomer also taking place under the special reaction conditions which are used.    However, the latter cleavage does not take place completely in that practically only the alcohol R3OH (8-alkoxy) situated next to the terminal aldehyde group is<br>
cleaved off.    The result of this incomplete alcohol cleavage from the telomer is that the desired product of formula I' or I" can be<br><br>
removed much more readily from the byproduct present at this stage than if all alkoxy groups OR3 had been cleaved off from the telomer.   Thus, the byproduct, which still has one or more substituents  OR3, remains in the mother liquor of the reaction mixture, while the desired product crystallizes out and is accordingly simple to remove, e.g. by filtration.    It is wholly surprising that the telomer loses only the (respective) 5-positioned alcohol R3OH in the cleavage step of the process in accordance with the invention.<br>
While some of the educts of the process in accordance with the invention are known, other precursors, which are in part known, can be produced according to methods known per se.<br>
Thus, for example, the polyene 0,0-dialkyI acetals of formula IT and the polyene di(0,0-dialkyl acetals) of formula 11" can be produced very readily in a generally known manner by reacting the polyene monoaldehyde of the formula A-CHO or polyene dialdehyde of the formula OHC-B-CHO with the respective trialkyl  orthoformate,  especially in the corresponding  C1-6-alkanol, e.g. methanol for the 0,0-dimethyl acetal, and in the presence of a catalytic amount of an organic acid or a Lewis acid, e.g. p-toluenesulphonic acid or zinc chloride, respectively (see, for example, Organikum, Organisch-chemisches Grundpraktikum, 6th edition, p. 377 et seq. (1963)].    The reaction takes place in suspension, i.e. the respective polyene monoaldehyde or dialdehyde is suspended in the alkanol and then conveniently about two or four mol equivalents,  respectively,  of the trialkyl orthoformate are added to the suspension, followed by a trace of acidic catalyst, e.g. p-toluenesulphonic acid.    Thereby, the monoaldehyde or dialdehyde dissolves slowly and the formed polyene 0,0-dialkyl acetal or di(0,0-dialkyl acetal) of formula 11711"  simultaneously crystallizes  out slowly.    The  reaction  is conveniently carried out in a temperature range of about 0°C to about 40°C, and as a rule takes about 2 to about 4 hours.   As further  literature  sources which  illustrate the  generally  known acetalization method reference is made to European Patent<br><br>
Publications 252 389 and 391 033 as well as to J. Mol. Cat. 79., 117 et seq. (1993).<br>
The polyene monoaldehydes A-CHO and dialdehydes OHC-B-CHO in turn are either known, especially from the technical literature concerning carotenoids, or - where novel - can be produced according to methods known per se.   Thus, for example, the  reaction of various Ci 5-Wittig   salts  with  2,7-dimethyl-2,4,6-octatrienedial  (the  so-called  "Cio-dialdehyde") to give the corresponding monoaldehydes, the reaction of various Cs-Wittig aldehydes with long-chain polyene aldehydes likewise to give such monoaldehydes as well as the two-fold reaction of the Cio-dialdehyde with C5- or do-Wittig aldehydes to give various dialdehydes are known from this literature.    The textbook "Carotenoids" (O. Isler, published by Birkhauser, Basel and Stuttgart, 1971), especially chapters VI and XII thereof and the further literature  mentioned therein,  provides much  useful information relating to the production and the occurrence of the known monoaldehydes and dialdehydes.   Where educts which have protected hydroxy, oxo or formyl groups are used, then such "protected" educts can be produced, for example, directly from the corresponding unprotected educts according to methods known per se.<br>
The 1-alkoxy-1,3-dienes of formula III are in part known compound; the remaining (novel) compounds can be produced from known starting materials according to methods known per se.<br>
Thus,   for   example,   1 -ethoxy-2-methyl-1,3-butadiene (formula III in which R1   signifies hydrogen,  R2 signifies methyl and R4 signifies ethyl) has been known from the literature for a long time (see, inter alia, J.A.C.S. 91, 3281 et seq. (1969), Bull. Soc. Chim. Fr. 1963, 1646 et seq. as well as J. Gen. Chem. USSR 29, 3649 et seq. (1959)] and has in each case been produced by the two-fold   cleavage   of   ethanol   from   1,1,3-triethoxy-2-methyl-butane.   The butane, in turn, can be produced by an enol ether condensation which has been known for a long time (see US Patent 2,165,962)  from the two  readily  accessible  starting  materials<br><br>
acetaldehyde diethyl acetal and ethyl (1-propenyl) ether [see, moreover, J.A.C.S. Zl, 3468 et seq. (1949) as well as J. Gen. Chem. USSR 2JL 3641 et seq. (1959)].   Thereby, about 2 to 3 equivalents of the acetal per equivalent of ethyl propenyl ether are heated slightly at about 35°C for up to about 2 hours with about 0.2 mol percent of boron trifluoride etherate as the catalyst in the absence of a solvent, with the desired butane being obtained in an about 66% yield.   The subsequent two-fold cleavage of ethanol from  the   1,1,3-triethoxy-2-methyl-butane  has  been  realized  in accordance with the relevant state of the art in two different ways:<br>
(i)      by cleavage in the liquid phase by adding the 1,1,3-triethoxy-2-methyl-butane   dropwise   to   isoquinoline containing a catalytic amount of p-toluenesulphonic acid at about  220°C  and  distilling  off the   1-ethoxy-2-methyl-1,3-butadiene which is formed immediately.    The yields are, however, moderate (about 40-50%) in this method which is described in Bull. Soc. Chim. Fr. 1963, 1646 et seq.; or<br>
(ii)    by cleavage in the gas phase at 300-350°C under a vacuum on an acidic catalyst, e.g. monosodium phosphate, magnesium dihydrogen phosphate or monoammonium phosphate [J. Gen. Chem. USSR 2£, 3649 et seq. (1959)] or a basic catalyst, e.g. aluminium oxide (US Patent 2,573,678), with the yields lying in the range of about 50 to 80%.<br>
A cleavage of ethanol in the gas phase at an elevated temperature on a fixed, solid catalyst is much more attractive for an industrial process than a cleavage in the liquid phase, since the former method has, inter alia, no solvent coupled with a simple reaction course and working up.   Therefore, the cleavage carried out in the gas phase is preferred.<br>
The   1 -methoxy-2-methyl-1,3-butadiene   (formula   III   in which R1  signifies hydrogen and R2 and R4 both signify methyl) is also known from the literature [Japanese Patent Publication (Kokai) 50891/1989].    It can be produced, for example,<br><br>
analogously  to  the  production  of  1-ethoxy-2-methyl-1,3-butadiene described above starting from acetaldehyde dimethyl acetal  and  methyl  (1-propenyl)  ether via  1,1,3-trimethoxy-2-methyl-butane.<br>
Review  articles for the  production  of  1-alkoxy-1,3-dienes will be found in Russian Chem. Rev. 38, 237 et seq. (1969) and in Pure and Appl. Chem. 47, 173 et seq. (1976); for additional literature concerning their production by gas phase catalysis reference is made to Lieb. Ann. Chem. 568. 1 et seq. (1950), Can. J. Res. B 2fi, 689 et seq. (1950), ibid. B 25, 118 et seq. (1947) as well as Chem. Ber. ZZ, 108 et seq. (1944).<br>
The remaining 1-alkoxy-1,3-dienes of formula III are also in part known compounds and can be produced analogously to the aforementioned compounds. The following Reaction Scheme is a compilation of the multistage process illustrated in more detail above and in accordance with which all 1-alkoxy-1,3-dienes of formula III can be produced:<br><br><br>
In this Reaction Scheme R1, R2 and R4 have the significances given above;  R4' signifies Ci-6-alkyl, conveniently - in order to avoid product mixtures - the same alkyl as R4.   Where R4' is different from R4, a product mixture of the two compounds III and III' can thus result.<br>
In the above-described production of the  1-alkoxy-1,3-dienes the respective product or intermediate can be isolated and purified in a manner known per se.<br>
The intermediates of the process in accordance with the invention, i.e. the compounds of general formulae IV and IV", are<br><br>
novel compounds and represent a further aspect of the present invention.<br>
Among these novel compounds of general formulae IV and IV" there are to be found:<br>

7,8,7',8'-tetrahydro-8,8,-dimethoxy-4,4,-diapocarotene-<br>
4,4'-dial.<br>
The products of the process in accordance with the invention, i.e. the polyene aldehydes and dialdehydes of general formulae I' and I", belong for the most part to the carotenoid field and can be used appropriately, for example as colorants or pigments for foodstuffs, egg yolk, the integuments (especially skin, legs and beak) and/or the subcutaneous fat of poultry, the flesh and/or the integuments (especially skin, scales and shell) of fish and crustaceans etc.   This use can be effected according to methods known per se, as described, for example, in European Patent Publication No. 630,578.<br>
The use of the novel products represents a further aspect of the present invention.<br>

2.84 g (10 mmol) of vitamin A aldehyde (&gt;99% pure) in 30 ml of methanol and 11  ml (100 mmol, 10 eq.) of trimethyl ortho-formate were placed in a 100 ml four-necked sulphonation flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer, argon gasification and a thermometer.    40 mg (0.3 mmol, 3 mol%) of anhydrous zinc chloride were added thereto at 0°C and the mixture was stirred at 0°C for 3 1/2 hours.   Then it was cooled to -40°C within one hour and filtered, and the solid was washed with a small amount of cold (at about -10°C) methanol and finally dried.   This gave 2.5 g (75% yield) of (all-E)-vitamin A aldehyde dimethyl acetal with m.p. 53-56°C; content according to HPLC: 98.4%.<br>

A solution of 20 mg of p-toluenesulphonic acid monohydrate in 10 ml of methanol was added thereto at room temperature and the mixture was stirred for 2 1/2 hours.    Thereby, the red crystals dissolved slowly and an orange crystallizate began to form.    Then 2 ml of triethylamine were added, the mixture was cooled to 0°C within about 30 minutes and suction filtered, and the solid was washed with a small amount of cold (-10°C) methanol and dried briefly under reduced pressure (water-jet vacuum).    After 30 minutes this gave  11.6 g of methanol-moist acetal with a content of 94.8% according to HPLC.   For recrystallization,  the  crystals were  dissolved  in  200 ml  of diethyl ether and then 600 ml of methanol were added thereto<br><br>

10 g (20.7 mmol) 4'-apo-p-carotenaI and 35 ml (0.31  mol, about 15 eq.)  of trimethyl orthoformate in 250 ml of methanol were placed in a 500 ml four-necked sulphonation flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, argon gasification and a thermometer. A solution of 25 mg of p-toluenesulphonic acid monohydrate in 15 ml of methanol was added at room temperature to the resulting dark red suspension, the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 45 minutes and then at 30-35°C for 1  1/2 hours; the dark red suspension changed to a brown suspension. Subsequently, 2 ml of triethylamine were added and the mixture was cooled to 0°C.    The precipitated crude product was filtered off under suction, washed with a small amount of cold methanol and dried briefly at room temperature under reduced pressure. The  thus-obtained  methanol-moist product  (about  17.8 g;  content according to HPLC: 91%) was dissolved in 600 ml of diethyl ether with  slight warming and treated at room temperature within<br>
1	hour with  1 I of methanol (containing 2%© triethylamine).    Then the mixture was suction filtered and the residue was washed with a small amount of cold (0°C) methanol.    This gave, after drying at room temperature and under reduced pressure for<br>

32.8 g (0.2 mol) of Cio-dialdehyde and 65 g of trimethyl orthoformate in 250 ml of methanol were placed in a 500 ml round flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer and argon gasification.    100 mg of p-toluenesulphonic acid monohydrate were added thereto at about 20°C, which produced a slightly exothermic reaction.    The reaction mixture was held at about 20-25°C using a cold water bath.    The suspension dissolved in about 5 minutes. Then the mixture was stirred at room temperature for one hour and about 0.5 ml of triethylamine was subsequently added.    The mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure and the separated crystal slurry was dissolved in 200 ml of hot n-hexane, filtered while hot through cotton wool and left to stand. The solution was left to stand at -20°C in a deep freezer for about  16 hours and the  resulting crystals were filtered off, washed with n-hexane at -20°C and dried to constant weight under a water-jet vacuum.   This gave 42.7 g (80% yield) of Cio-dialdehyde dimethyl acetal as pale yellow crystals with m.p. 68-69°C and a content according to gas chromatography (GC) of about 96%); UV (ethanol): 292 nm (log £ = 4.61; Ef*m = 1602), 280 nm (log e = 4.72; E11^n= 2046), 260 nm (log £ = 4.59; Ef?m =   1508).

Then the mixture was cooled to 0°C, filtered and the residue was washed with cold methanol  (-10°C).   This gave 24.7 g (92% yield) of crocetin dialdehyde dimethyl acetal as an orange powder, m.p. 136°C, with a content of 97.4% according to HPLC.

15-Methoxv-15.15'-dihvdro-12'-apo-p-carotenal<br>
2.38 g (7 mmol) of vitamin A aldehyde dimethyl acetal (HPLC:  97.8%)  and  1.13 g  (11.2 mmol)  of  1-methoxy-2-methyl-1,3-butadiene (GC: 98%) in 50 ml of toluene were placed under argon in a two-necked round flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer and a thermometer.   The mixture was cooled to -20°C, 15 mg  (1 mol%) of p-toluenesulphonic acid monohydrate were added thereto and the mixture was stirred at -20°C for 2 hours. In order to establish the course of the reaction, a sample was then removed and hydrolyzed with 1 to 2 drops of 90% aqueous acetic acid; the mixture was diluted with a large amount of water, the aqueous solution was extracted with a small amount of toluene and the extract was investigated by thin-layer chromatography [tic; on silica gel (SiC&gt;2)], with the following  result: tic (Si02): Rf = about 0.3; toluene/ethyl acetate (19:1).<br>
For the  hydrolysis,  10 ml of acetic acid/water (9:1) were added to the content of the round flask and the mixture was stirred at 0°C for one hour.   For the working up, the mixture was poured  into 35 ml of water and extracted twice with 35 ml each time, a total of 70 ml, of ethyl acetate.    Then the combined organic phases were washed three times with 35 ml each time, a total  of  105 ml,  of water,  once with saturated sodium bicarbonate solution and once with saturated sodium chloride solution, dried over anhydrous sodium sulphate, filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure.   This gave 3.0 g of yellow, oily crude product which was chromatographed on 300 g of silica gel  (0.04-0.063 mm)  with toluene/ethyl  acetate  (19:1   to 9:1). This  gave  1.2 g  (40% yield)  of  (all-E)-15-methoxy-15,15'-dihydro-12'-apo-(3-carotenal with a content according to HPLC of 90.5%; UV (cyclohexane, 2% chloroform): 328 nm (log e = 4.59;<br><br>

For the  hydrolysis,  10 ml of acetic acid/water (9:1) were then added to the contents of the round flask and the mixture was stirred at 0°C for 30 minutes.    For the working up, the mixture was poured into 25 ml of water and extracted twice with 25 ml each time, a total of 50 ml, of ethyl acetate.    Then the combined organic phases were washed three times with 25 ml each time, a total of 75 ml,  of water, once with saturated sodium  bicarbonate solution and once with saturated sodium chloride solution, dried over anhydrous sodium sulphate, filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure.

dimethyl   acetal   and   1 -methoxy-2-methyH.3-butadiene   via   12'-methoxv-1I'.^'-dihvdro-S'-apo-p-carotenal<br>
8.02 g (20 mmol) of 12'-apo-p-carotenal  dimethyl  acetal (content according to HPLC: about 99%) and 2.96 g (29 mmol) of 1-methoxy-2-methyM,3-butadiene (GC: about 96%) in  150 ml of n-hexane were placed under argon in a 200 ml sulphonation flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer and a thermometer.    40 mg (0.21  mmol, 1  mol%) of p-toluenesulphonic acid monohydrate were added at -25°C and the mixture was stirred at -22 to -25°C for 2 1/2 hours.    (The 12'-apo-[J-carotenal dimethyl  acetal  is soluble<br>
at room temperature, but again precipitates at -25°C).    During the reaction the  resulting pale yellow suspension dissolved slowly with the formation of a dark green solution which became brownish in colour at the end of the reaction [tic (Si02) after prior hydrolysis:  Rf of the product = about 0.4; Rf of the starting material (acetal) = about 0.5; toluene/ethyl acetate (19:1)].<br>
For the hydrolysis, 20 ml of acetic acid/water (9:1) were then added at -25°C and the reaction solution was stirred at 0°C for one hour.<br>
For the working up, the mixture was poured into 100 ml of water and extracted with  100 ml each time,  a total of 200 ml, of n-hexane.   Subsequently, the organic phase was washed in sequence with  water, with  100 ml of saturated sodium bicarbonate solution and with  100 ml of saturated sodium chloride solution.    Then, the organic phase was dried over anhydrous sodium sulphate, filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure.    About 80 ml of ethanol were added to the resulting residue and the solution was again concentrated in order to remove residues of hexane.    This gave 10.6 g of crude, still ethanol-moist    12'-methoxy-11,,12'-dihydro-8'-apo-p-carotenal<br>
as a red-orange, viscous oil [HPLC: 86.4% product, 5% byproduct (telomer); ratio product:byproduct = 94.5:5.5].    This oil was now<br><br>
dissolved in 170 ml of ethanol and transferred under argon into a 250 ml round flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer.    0.4 ml (about 2 mmol,  10mol%) of a 5.4M solution of sodium methylate in methanol was added to the red-orange solution at room temperature while stirring.    In so doing, the reaction solution immediately became deep dark red in colour and crystallization began after about 5 to 10 minutes.   The mixture was stirred at room temperature for about 1 hour [tic (Si02): Rf (intermediate) = about 0.4, Rf (product) = about 0.7; toluene/ethyl acetate (19:1)].<br>
Then the mixture was cooled (about 1/2 hour) at 0°C with an ice bath and neutralized with 0.5 g (about 8 mmol) of acetic acid in 2-3 ml of ethanol. 3.5 ml of water were added dropwise and the mixture was left to stand at +5°C  (refrigerator) for about 16 hours.    Thereafter, the precipitate was filtered off with a glass suction filter and washed twice with 20 ml each time, a total of 40 ml,  of ethanol/water (19:1) at 0°C, then with 70 ml of water at room temperature and twice more with 10 ml each time,  a total of 20 ml, of ethanol/water (19:1) at 0°C.    After drying under a water-jet vacuum at 45°C and under a high vacuum at room temperature there were obtained 7.53 g (83% yield) of 8'-apo-p-carotenal as a blue, crystalline powder with m.p.<br>
137-138°C and a content of 92% according to HPLC.<br>
For further purification, 7.48 g of the above powder were dissolved in  110 ml of acetone under reflux for about 10 minutes.    The solution was then treated dropwise through the condenser under reflux and while stirring vigorously with 8 ml of water, which triggered off a crystallization,  and the mixture was then cooled slowly to 0°C.   After stirring in an ice bath for about 2 hours the  precipitate was filtered  off and washed twice with 30 ml each time, a total of 60 ml, of ethanol/water (9:1) at 0°C, twice with 30 ml each time, a total of 60 ml, of water and finally three times with  5 ml each time,  a total of  15 ml,  of ethanol/water (9:1)  at 0°C.

Then, for the hydrolysis, 75 ml of acetic acid/water (9:1) were added at -25°C and the reaction solution was stirred at room temperature for 2 hours.    The subsequent working up was effected analogously to Example 7 or 8, which gave 42 g of crude 11,12,11', 12'-tetrahydro-12,12'-dimethoxy-8,8'-diapocarotene-8,8'-dial as a yellow oil.    This was taken up in 250 ml of methanol and the solution was treated while stirring with 2.75 ml (15mol%) of a 5.4M sodium methylate solution in methanol.    The mixture was stirred at 35°C for 1 1/2 hours [tic (Si02): Rf = about 0.6 (product) and about 0.4 (intermediate); toluene/ethyl   acetate   (4:1)].<br>
10 ml of acetic acid were added to the resulting red suspension.    The mixture was cooled to -10°C, stirred at this temperature for 2 hours and the resulting red crystals were filtered off.    Subsequently, the crystals were washed in sequence with  50 ml  of methanol/water (9:1)  at 0°C,  100 ml of water at room temperature and 50 ml of methanol/water (9:1) at 0°C and dried to constant weight under a water-jet vacuum at 35°C and under a high vacuum at room temperature.   In this manner there were obtained 21.8 g (73% yield) of crocetin dialdehyde as dark red, glistening crystals with m.p.  193-194°C and a content of 99.3% according to HPLC.<br><br>
Example 20 4.4'-Diapocarotenal<br>
350 mg   (0.75 mmol)   of   7,8,7,,8,-tetrahydro-8,8'-dimethoxy-4,4'-diapocarotin-4,4'-dial   (content  according  to  HPLC: 91.7%) in 18 ml of ethanol were placed under argon in a 25 ml round flask.    0.28 ml (1.5 mmol, 2 eq.) of a 5.4M sodium methoxide solution in methanol was added to the solution and the mixture was stirred at 50°C for 3 hours.   There was obtained a dark suspension [tic (Si02): Rf = about 0.5 (product) and about 0.3 (starting  material);  toluene/ethyl  acetate  (9:1)].<br>
After cooling the suspension to 0°C, filtering off the crystals, washing in sequence with 5 ml of methanol,  5 ml of water and 5 ml of methanol and drying under a high vacuum at room temperature there were obtained 295 mg (88% yield) of 4l4'-diapocarotenal as dark blue crystals with m.p. 226°C and a content of 96.3% according to HPLC.<br>
UV (cyclohexane/2% chloroform): 537 nm (log e = 5.14;   Effm = 3190), 501 nm (log e = 5.20;   E11^n= 3700), 471 nm (log e = 5.04; Ef*m=   2565); IR (KBr): 1680 cm-1 (CHO); mass spectrum: 428 (M+, 100).<br><br><br><br>
