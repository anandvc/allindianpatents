				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates generally to dry paint transfer techniques, and more particularly, to a process for making a dry paint transfer film in which a pigmented paint coat containing randomly oriented metallic flakes closely matches the appearance of traditional metallic spray painted finishes for automobiles.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Automotive design and manufacture present a unique set of problems in the selection of materials and processes used in the manufacture of automobile bodies. Recent trends in the selection of construction materials for automobile bodies and their components include the use of plastic materials for many components while the main body panels continue to be made principally from sheet metal. The use of combinations of materials for the construction of the different components of an automobile present unique problems in the matching of the paint finishes of the different components. Matching metallic paint finishes has been especially problematic.<br>
For example, for automobile body components made of sheet metal, painting processes have generally included either spray painting the body panel or sometimes dipping the body panel or even a partially assembled car body.  In<br>
either case, the painted finish is then baked at high temperature to harden the painted surfaces thoroughly. Most such paint systems use acrylic or urethane enamels that chemically crosslink during the baking step to form a hard, glossy, durable paint coat.<br>
In developing such baked-on painting processes, it has been determined that various visual effects can be created by varying the orientation of the metallic flakes used in a metallic paint finish. Sometimes the metallic flakes are oriented so as to be essentially parallel to the outer surface of the paint layer. These metallic paint finishes have what is known as high "flop" and produce bright, often desirable visual effects. Other times, a more random orientation of the metallic flakes is sought in order to achieve a different, more appealing metallic appearance. Such a random orientation of the metallic flakes in a baked-on and crosslinked acrylic or urethane enamel paint finish has been achieved by traditional spray painting techniques. Sometimes the random flake orientation has been enhanced by the addition of microspheres to the paint, as disclosed by Backhouse in U.S. Patent No. 4,403,003.<br>
In recent years the trend toward use of more plastic automobile body components has led to the development of new painting techniques. An initial problem to be overcome was that the plastic auto body panels and parts cannot be subjected to high temperatures for solvent evaporation and curing as is done in traditional sheet metal painting processes.<br>
In order to overcome this problem, processes for making thermoformable paint films were developed. According to these processes, a paint coat comprising a polymeric material is cast in thin film form onto a flexible heat-resistant temporary casting sheet. The paint coat is then dried by passing the sheet through an oven, followed by removing the paint coat from the casting sheet and transferring the paint coat to a thermoformable<br>
backing sheet. The paint coat on the thermoformable sheet retains the durability, gloss and many other appearance properties necessary for exterior automotive applications. The thermoformable paint sheets then can be thermoformed into the complex three-dimensional shapes of the plastic automobile parts or panels without detrimental effect on the appearance properties of the paint finish. The thermoformed sheet then can be molded to a plastic substrate body panel or part in an injection mold. This is known as an "insert mold" process. Alternatively, the thermoformable sheet can be shaped in the mold by the molding material itself in an "in mold" process.<br>
Such processes have been successful in achieving paint coats with high gloss levels, high distinctness-of-image, excellent durability and other desirable properties. Generally, the paint coats comprise a clear coat and a separate pigmented color coat. The pigmented color coat can also include reflective flakes to give the paint a desirable metallic appearance. The clear coat and color coat may be formed as separate thin film coatings which are dried and bonded to one another. While the use of a clear coat is optional, it is generally desired because it contributes to higher gloss for the finished paint film as well as better durability and weatherability. The multilayer paint coat can be formed by the sequential application of first a clear coat and then a color coat to the temporary casting sheet. The paint coats are applied in this order because the smooth casting sheet surface imparts a high gloss to what will ultimately be the outermost surface of the paint film once removed from the casting sheet and applied to a substrate.<br>
In one process disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,931,324 to Ellison et al., a clear coat is applied by reverse roll coating and a pigmented color coat containing flakes is applied by conventional spray painting techniques. The disclosed spray paint techniques and the polymeric materials used in the color coat produce what is described<br>
as an essentially parallel orientation of the reflective flakes. U.S. Patent No. 4,769,100 to Short discloses another process involving a decorative sheet applied to a contoured substrate by a shrink wrap process, in which metallic automotive paint films are applied to a stretchable carrier by spray painting techniques. The flakes are said to be essentially parallel and remain essentially parallel after vacuum forming to conform to the substrate surface.<br>
Processes using paint transfer films for applying automotive paints to molded plastic panels and parts have been carried out successfully using thermoplastic paint films made from an alloy of fluoropolymer and acrylic resins. Such processes have included a first step in which a clear coat is made by preparing a solution of a fluorinated polymer such as polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) , an acrylic resin such as polymethyl methacrylate, and a solvent. Alternatively, the PVDF may be present as a dispersion in a solution of acrylic resin and the solvent. The polymeric material is applied to a casting sheet and dried by passing it through an oven. A color coat is then applied over the clear coat. The color coat contains basically the same polymeric materials as the clear coat except that it also includes the pigment, and reflective flakes also can be added to achieve a metallic paint finish. The color coat is then dried and optional size coats and/or backing sheets can be applied to the color coat by the methods described previously.<br>
It is important to recognize that these thermoplastic paints films, though dried and hardened by a heating process, are very different from the hard, baked-on acrylic and urethane enamels that are applied to preformed components by standard sheet metal spray painting techniques. Since thermoplastic paint films do not crosslink, they are not hard and brittle like the thermoset films, but rather are capable of elongating<br>
during  thermoforming  without  cracking,  hazing,  or otherwise resulting in unacceptable paint finishes.<br>
In making the thermoformable paint films that are preferred for dry paint transfer films used in coating plastic automobile components, the traditional casting of solvent-based liquid paint coats, such as by roll coating processes, tends to produce a parallel orientation of the reflective flakes. Such coating techniques do not achieve the more random orientation of reflective flakes that has become a preferred metallic appearance and which is characteristic of the spray painted hard, durable thermoset paint coats used in the prior art. Spray coating of thermoformable paint films on a carrier sheet is said to produce an essentially parallel orientation of the flakes, as disclosed in Ellison et al. U.S. Patent No. 4,931,324 and Short U.S. Patent No. 4,769,100, mentioned previously. U.S. Patent No. 5,132,148 to Reafler also discloses a process for making a decorative transfer film for exterior automobile body panels. In this process a solvent-based polymeric color coat with dispersed reflective flakes is extruded onto a stretchable carrier sheet. This process is said to align the flakes in a generally parallel orientation and produces high "flop."<br>
Spray painting is not a desirable approach in producing decorative transfer films because it requires low viscosity, low solids paint coats with a high percentage of solvent. Elaborate and expensive environmental controls are required in order to reduce the solvent emissions during the coating process. Roll coating processes have heretofore been unsuccessful in achieving a random orientation of the reflective flakes in a metallic paint film to produce desirable metallic appearance effects. Extrusion of paint coats containing pigments is a difficult process in which to achieve uniform coloration in the finished film.<br>
Thus, there is a need for a process for making a dry paint  transfer  film  in  which  a  pigmented  metallic<br>
automotive paint coat achieves a sufficiently random orientation of the reflective flakes to closely match the metallic appearance of conventional spray painted metallic paint coats. Such a process using roll coating techniques is desirable to avoid the drawbacks of spray painting and extrusion of pigmented films containing flakes.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
Briefly stated, the invention overcomes the prior art's inability to effectively produce paint films that match the random orientation of reflective flakes of a traditional spray painted finish through roll coating techniques. According to one embodiment of the invention, a random orientation of reflective flakes in a pigmented automotive paint coat is achieved by adding the reflective flakes and pigment to a paint vehicle in which a fluorinated polymer is formed as a dispersion in a solution of a solvent or mixture of solvents and an acrylic resin. The paint coating thus formed can be roll coated onto a carrier sheet and then fused and dried by solvent evaporation to form a metallic paint film in which the dispersed form of the fluorinated polymer inhibits parallel orientation of the flakes. The paint film thus produced has an absence of optical haze and a random orientation of reflective flakes that closely matches the random orientation and metallic appearance of the reflective flakes in a spray-painted baked-on and crosslinked acrylic enamel or urethane paint finish, for example. The similarity in flake orientation can be quantified by comparing the "Travel Index" and/or the "Spectral Curve" of the paint film with the film to be matched, described as follows.<br>
The properties of metallic paint coatings have been defined as varying with the orientation of the reflective flakes in the finished paint coat. Certain tests have been developed to measure the physical properties and characteristics of such metallic paint coatings and are<br>
extremely useful in determining whether two different paint coatings match one another. These tests generally measure the property referred to previously as "flop," which measures a metallic paint coat's ability to appear to change colors and/or lightness and darkness depending upon the angle from which a painted surface is viewed.<br>
One such test determines what is referred to as the Travel Index of a paint coating. According to this test, a multi-angle spectrophotometer such as an X-RiteÂ® Model MA68 multi-angle spectrophotometer is used to measure the amount of reflectance of a source lamp at various viewing angles. The source lamp is oriented such that a specular angle of 45Â° is achieved and the percent reflectance is automatically measured at different angles from the specular. Generally, measurements are taken at 15Â°, 25Â°, 45Â°, 75Â° and 110Â° from the specular angle. Such a test method generally indicates the degree to which lightness and darkness changes take place as a result of viewing a metallic paint finish at different angles. This measurement is useful for comparing two different paint coatings to determine whether their reflective flakes are similarly oriented and therefore have a similar metallic appearance.<br>
A second test determines a "Spectral Curve" for a given paint color. According to this test, for a particular viewing angle, the percent reflectance is measured over the various wavelengths of the light reflected from the paint coating. This too is an effective way to compare two paint coatings for color match dependent upon the orientation of the reflective flakes.<br>
Referring again to the process of this invention, the fluorinated polymer is preferably a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) copolymer of low molecular weight. Preferred acrylic resins are polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), polyethylmethacrylate (PEMA) or mixtures of the two. The PVDF copolymer has an average particle size less<br>
than about 3 5 Âµ. (microns). Larger particle sizes tend to cause optical haze when the paint coat is fused under application of heat. Copolymers of PVDF are preferred over homopolymers because they provide a dispersion with good flow characteristics without the need for aggressive solvents. Aggressive solvents are undesirable as they can tend to attack the clear coat, creating flaws in the finished paint film, most notably, reduced distinctness-of-image.<br>
The paint film made by this invention can be thermoformed to various shapes through well known thermoforming techniques. The finish of the thermoformed product has been shown to match closely with the finish of traditional hard, durable, baked-on spray painted metallic automotive paint films. Little, if any, of the random orientation of the reflective flakes is lost in the thermoforming step. Travel Index and Spectral Curve measurements and comparisons show very accurate matches in metallic appearance over a wide spectrum of viewing angles.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention relates to a process for controlling the metallic appearance of a metallic automotive paint film containing reflective flakes to achieve a random orientation of the reflective flakes, the process comprising: casting a layer of a thermoplastic and thermoformable pigment-containing metallic automotive paint coat onto a carrier; the cast paint coat comprising a dispersion of a fiuorinated polymeric material in a solvent-based solution of an acrylic resin, the dispersed fiuorinated polymeric material having an average particle size between 1 micron to 35 microns and being uniformly dispersed in the solution of acrylic resin, the cast paint coat has a pigment uniformly dispersed in the paint coat to provide coloration, and reflective flakes uniformly dispersed in the paint coat to impart to the paint film a metallic appearance; and drying the cast paint coat to fuse the paint coat and thereby form a finished metallic automotive paint film in which the parallel orientation of the reflective flakes to one another is inhibited such that the flake orientation of the finished paint film provides a randomly oriented distribution of the reflective flakes.<br>
The invention also relates to a process for controlling the metallic appearance of a metallic automotive paint film containing reflective flakes to achieve a random orientation of the reflective flakes, the process comprising: casting a layer of a thermoplastic and thermoformable pigment-containing metallic automotive paint coat onto a carrier; the cast paint coat comprising a dispersion of a fiuorinated polymeric material in a solvent-based solution of an optically clear weatherable resinous material, the dispersed fiuorinated polymeric material having a mean particle size of eleven microns or lower and being uniformly dispersed in the solution of resinous material, the said cast paint coat comprises a pigment uniformly dispersed in the paint coat to provide coloration, and reflective flakes uniformly dispersed in the paint coat to impart to the paint film a metallic appearance; and drying the cast paint coat to fuse the paint coat and thereby form a finished metallic automotive paint film in which the parallel orientation of the reflective flakes to one another is inhibited such that the flake orientation of the finished paint film provides a randomly oriented distribution of the reflective flakes.<br>
These and other aspects of the invention will be more fully understood by referring to the following detailed description and the accompanying drawings.<br>

Detailed Description<br>
Referring to FIG. la, a prior art roll coated paint film comprises a color coat 10 which includes reflective flakes 12 and a uniformly dispersed pigment. An exterior clear coat 14 coated over the color coat provides enhanced durability, weatherability and gloss to the paint finish. The entire paint coat is bonded to a molded plastic substrate panel 16 which represents the automobile part to which the paint finish has been bonded. A thermoformable backing sheet (not shown) is often used between the color coat and the substrate. As illustrated in this drawing figure, the reflective flakes 12 are oriented such that they are generally parallel to the outer surface of the paint finish.<br>
In contrast, and according to FIG. lb, a prior art baked-on paint coat of the hard, durable thermoset type includes a color coat 18 containing a uniformly dispersed pigment and reflective flakes 20. An exterior clear coat 22 provides the desired gloss and durability to the paint finish. This film is commonly applied directly to a sheet metal body part 24 by spray painting techniques which cause the metallic flakes to be randomly oriented rather than being oriented parallel to the paint finish.<br>
Because of the wide difference in orientation of the metallic flakes of the two paint coatings illustrated in FIGS, la and lb, the two paint coatings do not have the same overall appearance even though the amounts of pigment and reflective flakes used are identical. Generally, the roll coated thermoformable paint film of FIG. la with its parallel flake orientation has a bright appearance when viewed at the near specular and specular angles but lacks the luster and sparkle of the hard, durable baked-on paint coat of FIG. lb, in which the flakes are more randomly oriented. It should be recognized that the term "baked on" as used in this application refers to paint coatings that are applied directly to an already formed article and then baked to form a hard crosslinked finished paint coat.<br>
In contrast, thermoformable and thermoplastic paint films refer to paint coatings that are cast on a carrier sheet and subjected to elongation when later thermoformed to a desired three-dimensional shape.<br>
According to the present invention, paint coats containing randomly oriented metallic flakes similar to standard spray painted baked-on automotive paints can be achieved through roll coating techniques. As a result, the desired metallic appearance of such spray painted automotive paint coats which heretofore have been applied to sheet metal parts can be produced in decorative surfacing films applied to plastic body parts without the disadvantages of spray painting. As illustrated in FIG. 2, a color coat 26 of a metallic automotive paint can be formed by such roll coating techniques with randomly oriented reflective flakes 28 uniformly dispersed in the paint coat. An outer clear coat 3 0 and an underlying plastic substrate panel 32 also are shown in FIG. 2. The clear coat 3 0 can be coated on a carrier sheet by roll coating techniques, or the clear coat can be formed by extrusion techniques.<br>
The random orientation of the reflective flakes is achieved, in one embodiment, by forming the paint coat from a combination of an acrylic resin and a thermoplastic fluorinated polymer wherein the fluorinated polymer is present as a dispersion in, rather than in solution with, the acrylic resin. The alloy of the fluorinated polymeric material and the acrylic resin has thermoplastic properties and is thermoformable into a desired three dimensional shape.<br>
As an alternative, polyvinyl chloride dispersion resin may be used in place of the fluoropolymer.<br>
The paint coat formulation is prepared by mixing the acrylic resin with a suitable organic solvent and by applying heat to dissolve the acrylic resin in the solvent. The mixture is then allowed to cool sufficiently before adding the fluorinated polymer component so that<br>
the fluorinated polymer does not dissolve, but is maintained as a dispersion in the acrylic solvent-based mixture. The pigment then can be added to the mixture in appropriate quantities to achieve the desired uniformly dispersed color. The flakes are also uniformly dispersed in the color coat formulation. By maintaining the fluorinated polymer component as a dispersion in the acrylic resin solution, the reflective flakes of the resulting film become randomly oriented by the dispersed form of the particles of the fluoropolymer component which separates the flakes and thereby inhibits a parallel orientation such as that characteristic of the flakes in a prior art solution-based formulation.<br>
The resulting dispersion can be coated onto a carrier sheet by traditional casting techniques such as by roll coating techniques. Generally, a reverse roll coating technique is preferred. The clear coat and color coat are coated onto the carrier sheet by a reverse roll coating process illustrated in FIG. 3, although the clear coat and color coat can be applied by gravure printing, or other conventional coating techniques involving liquid or solvent coating in which the paint coat is spread in liquid form onto the carrier and the resulting paint coat can be characterized as molecularly unoriented. Referring to the reverse roller coating process of FIG. 3, the color coat material is contained in a coating pan 30 having a lacquer inlet 32 in the main portion of the pan and a lacquer drain 34 on an opposite side of a weir 36. An applicator roll 38 rotates to pick up the lacquer from the pan and coat it onto a carrier film 40 which passes over a guide roll 42 and. then passes between the applicator roll and a rubber backup roll 44. As mentioned previously, the clear coat is coated first and then dried, followed by casting the color coat on the clear-coated carrier sheet. FIG. 3 represents coating of either a clear coat or a color coat containing flakes on the polyester carrier sheet 40.  A metering roll 46 adjacent<br>
the applicator roll rotates in the same direction as the applicator roll. A doctor blade 48 wipes the surface of the metering roll to properly control the thickness of the coating on the applicator roll. The adjustable gap between the metering roll and the applicator roll controls the thickness of the coating on the surface of the applicator roll. The coating picked up by the applicator roll is then coated onto the polyester carrier film as the film passes into contact with the reverse-rotating applicator roll. The applied coating on the film is shown at 50. The coated film then passes to a drying oven. The resulting paint film can be used to coat automobile components by traditional thermoforming techniques. It is important to note that even after thermoforming the films retain the randomly oriented reflective flakes of the paint film.<br>
The fluorinated polymer component is preferably a thermoplastic fluoropolymer such as polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF). Copolymers are especially preferred over homopolymers because they result in less haze of the resulting paint film. Copolymers of vinylidene fluoride and tetrafluoroethylene, and copolymers of vinylidene fluoride and hexafluoropropylene have been shown to work well. The preferred PVDF copolymers are of medium to low molecular weight as characterized by a melt viscosity of below about 20,000 centipoise.<br>
The particle size of the dispersed fluorinated polymer also is an important factor in producing the random flake orientation. A maximum particle size of greater than 35 Âµ. tends to cause a loss of clarity and haze in the resulting paint film when the film fuses during the drying step. It has also been found that if the average particle size is too small, the randomness of the orientation of the reflective particles is largely lost. In one embodiment, the particle size distribution is as follows. Substantially none of the particles have a particle size greater than 35 Âµ.,   and more preferably,<br>
about  25 Âµ.	The  particle  size  distribution  curve<br>
generally follows a standard bell shaped curve, with essentially all particles falling within the range of about 1-21 Âµ.. The mean particle size is about 6-7 Âµ., and the average particle size is about 6.5 Âµ.. Approximately 10% of all particles are less than 3 Âµ. in size and approximately 90% of all particles are less than 11 Âµ. in size. This defines a mean particle size distribution range of about 3-11 Âµ... More preferably, about 75% of all particles are within an average particle size distribution range of about 6-10 Âµ. Although the particle size distribution curve can vary somewhat, it is preferred that the average particle size fall within the range of about 3-11 Âµ. and more preferably, about 6-10 Âµ.. If necessary, the fluorinated polymer material is air-milled to reduce the particle size to the desired range. It should also be recognized that by varying the particle size, various different visual appearances can be achieved for the finished paint film. For example, the degree to which the reflective flakes are randomly oriented can be varied between a highly oriented, that is, a generally parallel orientation, to a highly random orientation by controlling the particle size of the dispersed fluoropolymer.<br>
The preferred acrylic resins used in the invention are acrylics such as polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) and polyethylmethacrylate (PEMA) resins or mixtures thereof, including methacrylate copolymer resins and minor amounts of other comonomers. The acrylic resin is useful in adding clarity to the system as well as for dispersing the pigment and the flakes.<br>
The solvents used in forming the dispersion are preferably non-aggressive solvents such as heptyl acetate. However, if necessary to achieve good fusion of the fluoropolymer and acrylic resins, a more aggressive solvent such as butylacetone (BLO) can be used. Generally, a blend of heptyl acetate and BLO is preferred. However, if a homopolymer is used as the fluorinated<br>
polymer, a higher concentration of the more aggressive solvent is required. The reason that the amount of aggressive solvent is to be minimized is to prevent the solvent in the dispersion from attacking the clear coat of the paint film. Even though the clear coat eventually forms the outermost layer on the painted substrate, it is generally cast on the casting film before the color coat. If too much of an aggressive solvent is used, the color coat can penetrate too deeply into the clear coat causing undesirable visual effects.<br>
The preferred ratios of the fluorinated polymer to acrylic resin in the dispersions of the present invention are generally between about 0.25 to 4.0 parts PVDF to one part acrylic resin for a PVDF and PEMA dispersion, by weight of the total solids contained in the PVDF/acrylic blend. Most preferably, the PVDF to acrylic ratio is about 50-70% PVDF to about 30-50% acrylic resin, by weight. Higher amounts of PVDF generally result in reduced clarity for the resulting paint films.<br>
A requirement for the reflective flakes and pigment used in the dispersion is that they be compatible with the particular fluorinated polymer and acrylic resin used in the dispersion. A metallic paste comprising aluminum flakes in a hydrocarbon solvent is generally used as the source of reflective flakes. However, mica flakes can also be used. Exterior automotive pigments are generally provided in a carrier of acrylic resin and solvent. It is important that the acrylic resin in the carrier for the pigment be compatible with the resin blend of the paint coat dispersion. Generally about 88-90 parts by weight of dispersion vehicle (polymer blend and solvents) are combined with about 10-12 parts by weight of metallic paste and pigment, including carrier, to produce the dispersion.<br>
Generally, the clear coat has a dry film thickness of about 1.0 to 2.0 mils and the color coat has a dry film thickness of about 0.7-1.4 mils.<br>
Other additives such as flow improvers and ultraviolet absorbers can also be added to the dispersion to obtain a finished paint film with the desired properties.<br>
Following the steps of casting the clear coat and the metallic color coat on the carrier sheet, the composite paint coat is removed from the carrier and transfer-laminated to a thin, semi-rigid thermoformable polymeric backing sheet. A preferred backing sheet is made of ABS (acrylonitrile-butydiene-styrene) or a polyolefin such as polypropylene or polyethylene. The preferred backing sheet is about 20 mils in thickness, although the backing sheet can be from 10 to 40 mils thick. The backing sheet is then thermoformed into the desired three-dimensional shape, followed by molding the substrate panel to the thermoformed sheet in an injection mold. This process, known as the "insert-mold" process, together with the transfer-lamination and thermoforming steps are described in more detail in the applicant's International Application PCT/US88/00991, which is incorporated herein by this reference.<br>
Alternatively, the transfer-laminated, thermoformable sheet can be placed directly in the injection mold without thermoforming it outside the mold. The sheet in this instance has a thickness of about 6 mils. The sheet is then formed into a contoured shape under heat and pressure in the injection mold by the molding material in what is referred to as an "in-mold" process. The polymeric materials used as substrate materials in either process are compatible with the polymeric material of the backing sheet and comprise ABS, polyolefin, polycarbonate and similar molded polymeric materials for automotive use.<br>
The decorative transfer film made by this invention can produce a high gloss, high distinctness-of-image paint finish that also meets other exterior automotive specifications for durability and weatherability. The transfer sheet has a distinctness-of-image of greater than<br>
60 before thermoforming, and this level is retained through thermoforming and following the molding step. As mentioned, the metallic color match produced by the random orientation of the flakes also is essentially retained after the thermoforming and molding steps.<br>
The invention will more fully be explained by the following examples.<br>
Example 1<br>
A metallic paint coating according to the present invention was prepared with the goal of matching the standard painted finish for 1994 General Motors Truck Color Gray Metallic (WAEM-8798). A vehicle for the pigment was first prepared by combining 26.42 parts by weight of the solvent ExxateÂ® 700, produced by Exxon Chemicals that comprises heptoacetate in a blend of esters, and 11.32 parts by weight of butylacetone (BLO). To this mixture were added 0.11 parts by weight of the additive Solsperse 17000 to improve the flow properties of the mixture and 0.71 parts by weight of an ultraviolet (UV) absorber, Tinuvin 234. Then, while mixing the above mixture, 18.87 parts by weight of the acrylic resin polyethylmethacrylate (PEMA) were added. The PEMA used in this example was ElvaciteÂ® 2043, a product of DuPont. The resulting mixture was mixed and heated until the PEMA was completely dissolved. If necessary, the mixture was allowed to cool to less than 85Â°F.<br>
While the PEMA solution was continuously mixed, and only after the solution had cooled to less than 85Â°F, 28.31 parts by weight of PVDF were added. In this example, KynarÂ® 2821, produced by Elf Atochem, was used as the PVDF. The PVDF was air-milled to produce a particle size distribution similar to that described previously. The mixture was mixed at high speed while scraping the sides of the container to achieve a dispersion of PVDF in the PEMA solution. During mixing, the temperature was not allowed to exceed 100Â°F.<br>
While the PVDF was being dispersed in the PEMA solution, a solvent mixture of 7 parts by weight of ExxateÂ® 700 to 3 parts by weight of BLO was premixed. A portion of this premix of solvent was added to dilute the dispersion after the particle size of the dispersed PVDF was reduced. The dispersion was diluted with the premixed solvent until the viscosity had been reduced to 2000 Â± 200 centipoise. A total of 14.25 parts by weight of the premixed solvent was necessary. The resulting dispersion was then used as a dispersion vehicle for the paint coating of the present invention.<br>
A standard solution vehicle was then prepared by conventional methods. A solvent mixture of 35.14 parts by weight of methyl propyl ketone and 34.83 parts by weight of cyclohexanone was prepared and 22.52 parts by weight of PVDF (KynarÂ® 7201) were added under slow agitation along with 7.51 parts by weight of PMMA (ElvaciteÂ® 2008) under slow agitation. The mixing speed was increased as the mixture thickened and the mixing was continued until the resin was completely dissolved, taking care not to introduce any air bubbles into the solution.<br>
The pigment dispersion was prepared by adding the following mixture to 90.92 parts of the dispersion vehicle under agitation: 0.68 parts phthalo blue dispersion, Gebraltar Chemical Works (460-34550), 0.2 parts carbazole violet dispersion (Gibraltar 460-37450), 6.00 parts jet carbon black dispersion (Gibraltar 460-39350), and 1.00 parts aluminum paste Silberline Mfg., Tamaqua, FL (5271AR). The dispersion was mixed for 20 minutes to thoroughly blend the ingredients.<br>
For the solution vehicle 82.92 parts of vehicle were mixed with four parts methyl propyl Ketone, four parts cyslobexanone and the same percentages of color dispersions and aluminum. Extra solvent was added to get to 1000 cps, application viscosity.<br>
The dispersion paint coating and the solution paint coating were each applied to a carrier sheet by a reverse<br>
roll technique, dried and removed from the carrier sheet. The dispersion coated paint film and the solution coated paint films were then compared to a hard, durable baked-on cross-linked urethane enamel paint film of the same metallic color applied by spray-painting techniques. While both the dispersion coated paint film and the solution coated paint film had close color matches to the paint sample, the dispersion coated paint film had a much better match in overall metallic appearance, especially when flop was considered.<br>
In order to quantify the above results, the three paint samples were compared using a multi-angle spectrophotometer. The use of such a spectrophotometer is illustrated schematically in FIG. 4. A lamp is directed to shine on a paint sample 20, and measurements of the reflectance at angles of 15Â°, 25Â°, 45Â°, 75Â° and 110Â° from the 45Â° specular angle were taken. The resulting curves define a "Travel Index" of each paint film, described previously.<br>
According to the test results illustrated in FIG. 5,the dispersion coated film as produced by the present invention has a near-perfect match to the standard spray painted baked-on urethane enamel test sample. In contrast, the solution coated paint film made by prior art roll coating methods did not match very closely. It reflected too much of the source light at the high and low angles, but too little of the source light at the intermediate angles.<br>
Example 2<br>
According to this example, a dispersion paint coating of the present invention was prepared in order to match a sample of 1995 Ford Portofino (KXQCWHA, M-6623) metallic paint. A dispersion paint coating was prepared by mixing 90.42 parts by weight of the dispersion vehicle prepared in Example 1 with 5.2 3 parts by weight of a 3 52 mesh grade aluminum paste and 2.20 parts by weight of a 400 mesh<br>
grade aluminum paste. The 3 52 mesh grade aluminum paste was a paste made by Silberline Manufacturing Co., Inc. of Tamaqua, Pennsylvania known as Sparkle SilverÂ® 3141-ST and having an average particle size of 32.8 Âµ. The 400 mesh grade aluminum paste was a product also made by Silberline and sold as Sparkle SilverÂ® 5271-AR, having an average particle size of 17.8 Âµ. To this mixture were added 0.23 parts by weight of Carbazole Violet pigment, 0.2 3 parts by weight of jet black pigment and 1.70 parts by weight of Indanthrone Blue pigment, all of which are sold by Gibraltar Chemical Works, Inc. of South Holland, Illinois.<br>
A solution paint coating was made by replacing the dispersion vehicle with the standard solution vehicle then using the same pigments to achieve the closest match possible.<br>
The two paint coatings were formed into paint films by reverse roll coating them onto carrier sheets and drying the coatings. The resulting films were then compared to a spray-painted baked-on urethane enamel paint sample of the same metallic color. While all three had closely matching color characteristics, the dispersion coated film had a better overall match to the flop characteristics of the standard spray-painted urethane enamel sample. This was quantified by plotting Spectral Curves for each of the three samples. According to this test method, the percent reflectance is measured at wavelengths between 400 and 700 nanometers (nm), and plotted, as shown in FIG. 6. All measurements were taken at a spectral angle of approximately 60Â°. As illustrated by FIG. 6, the dispersion coated paint film matches the standard paint sample almost identically. In contrast, the solution coated paint film has consistently higher reflectance over all measured wavelengths, indicating a much higher parallel orientation of the metallic flakes compared to the standard paint sample.<br>
FIGS. 7 and 8 illustrate a comparison of the solution-based and dispersion-based paint films in matching a metallic paint standard.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
