BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to radio telecommunication systems. More particularly, and<br>
not by way of limitation, the invention relates to a system and method for automatically<br>
modifying multimedia messages sent from a mobile phone with multimedia capabilities.<br>
FIG. 1 is a simplified block diagram of a typical network configuration in which a<br>
Multimedia Messaging Service Environment (MMSE) 11 has been implemented. The<br>
Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS) enables mobile subscribers to take pictures with<br>
their camera-capable mobile phones and send the photographs through the network to<br>
other mobile phones or fixed-line subscribers. Mobile subscribers (i.e., MMS User<br>
Agents) 12-14 may access the MMSE through, for example, a 2G mobile network 15, a<br>
3G mobile network 16, or a foreign mobile network 17 and the Internet or other IP<br>
network 18. A Multimedia Messaging Center (MMC) 19 may include an MMS Relay 20,<br>
an MMS Server 21, and a message store 22 for storing MMS messages until recipients<br>
retrieve them. Other user databases 23 storing, for example, subscriber profiles,<br>
subscription information, or other Home Location Register (HLR) information may be<br>
connected to the MMS Relay. MMS Value Added Services (VAS) applications 24 may<br>
also be connected to the MMS Relay. External servers 25 and wired e-mail clients 26 may<br>
connect to the MMS Relay through the Internet/IP network.<br>
FIG. 2 is a message flow diagram illustrating the flow of messages between network<br>
elements when a multimedia message such as a photograph is sent from an originating<br>
MMS User Agent (MO) 31 to a terminating MMS User Agent (MT) 32 using<br>
conventional signaling methodologies. The MO originates a multimedia message by<br>
sending a M-Send.req message 33 to the Multimedia Messaging Center (MMC)<br>
Relay/Server 34 via a Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) Gateway/Push Proxy 35.<br>
This transmits the required data for the photograph from the MO to the MMC<br>
Relay/Server and provides a transactional context for the resulting M-Send.conf response<br>
message 36.<br>
The MMC Relay/Server 34 sends an M-Notification.ind message 37 to the MT 32 via a<br><br>
HTTP/PUSH through a WAP Gateway 38. The M-Notification.ind message informs the<br>
MT that a multimedia message is available for retrieval. Included as a data component is a<br>
Universal Resource Locator (URL) of the multimedia message that is being stored by the<br>
MMC Relay/Server. The URL functions as a message ID for the specific message to be<br>
delivered to this specific MT. The MT sends an M-Notify Response.ind 39 to the MMC<br>
Relay/Server indicating that the M-Notification.ind message was received. At some time<br>
later, when the MT desires to retrieve the multimedia message, the MT sends a WSP<br>
GET.req message 40 to the MMC Relay/Server. The retrieval activity is performed via<br>
the WSP/HTTP on the URL provided. In response, the MMC Relay/Server sends to the<br>
MT an M-Retrieve.conf message 41, which contains the actual multimedia message to be<br>
presented to the receiving subscriber.<br>
The MMC Relay/Server 34 may also request information from the MT 32 to confirm that<br>
the MT actually received the multimedia message. In one approach, a distinct M-<br>
Acknowledge.ind message 42 is sent' from the MT to the MMC Relay/Server when the<br>
multimedia message is successfully received. The MMC Relay/Server may optionally<br>
send a delivery report back to the MO 31. This may be done utilizing HTTP/PUSH<br>
technology to send an M-Delivery.ind message 43 to the MO.<br>
Despite the features described above, the number and frequency with which subscribers<br>
utilize MMS is below the expectations of network operators. In many cases, subscribers<br>
might utilize MMS, but conditions are not good for taking photographs. Alternatively, the<br>
subscribers may not think that their photograph is interesting enough to send. The present<br>
invention provides a solution to help overcome these problems and increase subscriber<br>
utilization of MMS.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention to overcome the above mentioned<br>
problems and to provide a system and method for automatically modifying multimedia<br>
messages sent from a mobile phone with multimedia capabilities.<br><br>
Thus, in one aspect, the present invention is directed to a method of modifying a<br>
photograph contained in a multimedia message sent from a camera-enabled mobile phone.<br>
The method includes the steps of receiving in a service center, an original photograph in<br>
the multimedia message; extracting an image from an image database; and creating a<br>
modified photograph by pasting the image into the original photograph. The multimedia<br>
message may also include location information for the camera-enabled mobile phone, and<br>
the extracting step may include utilizing the location information to extract from the<br>
database, an image associated with the location of the mobile phone. The method may<br>
also include sending the modified photograph to the camera-enabled mobile phone;<br>
receiving from the camera-enabled mobile phone, an indication that the modified<br>
photograph is selected for sending to a recipient; and sending the modified photograph to<br>
the recipient.<br>
In yet another aspect, the present invention is directed to a method of modifying a<br>
photograph contained in a multimedia message sent from a camera-enabled mobile phone.<br>
The method includes the steps of receiving in a service center, an original photograph in<br>
the multimedia message; and creating a modified photograph by enhancing the brightness,<br>
color, or clarity of the original photograph.<br>
In still yet another aspect, the present invention is directed to a Multimedia Messaging<br>
Service Center for modifying a video stream contained in a multimedia message sent from<br>
a video-enabled mobile device. The Center includes means for receiving an original video<br>
stream from the video-enabled mobile device; a database for storing a plurality of video<br>
images; and a video manipulator that creates a modified video stream by pasting a<br>
plurality of video images extracted from the database into the original video stream. The<br>
Center may also include means for sending the modified video stream to the video-enabled<br>
mobile device; means for receiving from the video-enabled mobile device, an indication<br>
that the modified video stream is selected for sending to a recipient; and means for sending<br>
the modified video stream to the recipient.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
In the following description, for purposes of explanation and not limitation, specific<br>
details are set forth, such as particular embodiments, circuits, signal formats, and the like<br>
in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. It will be apparent<br>
to one skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced in other embodiments<br>
that depart from these specific details.<br>
The present invention provides an enhanced MMS+ service, which may be particularly<br>
useful when environmental conditions are not optimal for taking photographs. For<br><br>
example, there may not be enough light, it may be raining, or a particular tourist attraction<br>
that the subscriber wishes to photograph may be under construction or renovation. The<br>
present invention enables the subscriber to take a photograph under the less than optimal<br>
conditions, and send the photograph to an MMS+ service provider. The MMS+ service<br>
provider automatically manipulates the photograph to improve its quality, and sends one<br>
or more versions of the photograph back to the subscriber for review and approval. The<br>
MMS+ service provider may manipulate the photograph itself (for example, zooming in<br>
on items of interest or adjusting the brightness, color, or clarity), or may paste images<br>
from an image database into the photograph. The subscriber can accept a manipulated<br>
photograph and send it to another subscriber, reject the manipulated photograph and<br>
discard it in favor of the original photograph, or cancel the transaction altogether.<br>
In one embodiment, the subscriber's mobile phone requests its position via location-based<br>
services, and sends the location information together with a photograph to the MMS+<br>
service provider. The location information may be pasted into the photograph in a suitable<br>
manner, for example by a java application, before the photograph is sent from the mobile<br>
phone. When the MMS+ service provider receives the photograph and the location<br>
information, the MMS+ service provider extracts the location information. The location<br>
information may then be converted to an ID associated with the approved MMS+ location<br>
closest to the location received from the mobile phone. The location information, or<br>
optionally the location ID, is then used to access a database of images to determine<br>
whether there is an image stored in the database that is applicable to the photograph<br>
received from the subscriber. If so, automatic manipulation is performed.<br>
In another embodiment, the mobile phone sends an MMS message to the MMS+ service<br>
provider with a photograph and an indication that enhanced MMS+ services are requested.<br>
The MMS+ service provider then obtains the location of the mobile phone through<br>
location-based services. Alternatively, deferred location reporting is used, and the MMS+<br>
service provider is notified whenever the user enters an identified area where enhanced<br>
MMS+ services are provided. The MMS+ services provider stores this information so that<br>
when the MMS+ services provider receives an MMS message from the mobile phone, the<br>
MMS+ services provider can associate the location with the received MMS message.<br><br>
In one embodiment, if the photograph contains people in front of a poor quality<br>
background, the MMS+ service provider may enhance the photograph by keeping the<br>
people in the foreground and replacing the background with a high quality background<br>
image appropriate for the reported location. For example, if the location information<br>
indicates that the subscriber is near the Eiffel Tower, a high quality background image of<br>
the Eiffel Tower is selected and pasted into the photograph. Since the photograph has<br>
been taken from a known location in a known direction, the perspective of the original<br>
photograph and the image in the database should be quite similar.<br>
Additionally or alternatively, the MMS+ service provider may manipulate the photograph<br>
to enhance the colors, brighten the image, and/or improve the clarity of the image. The<br>
MMS+ service provider compares the two pictures and adjusts them to minimize<br>
differences in brightness and color per pixel. Additionally, a specific area in the original<br>
photograph such as the area containing the people in the foreground, or an area containing<br>
a point of interest, may be marked with a stencil. Within this area, the original photograph<br>
is compared with the image in the database. Each pixel between the original photograph<br>
and the image in the database is compared regarding color and brightness. If the<br>
differences exceed a predefined threshold, the pixel color and brightness from the original<br>
photograph are taken; otherwise, the pixel color and brightness from the database image<br>
are taken. This algorithm may be enhanced with more sophisticated, known, edge-<br>
detection mechanisms to minimize the border between the stenciled area and the rest of<br>
the photograph.<br>
In another embodiment, the MMS+ service provider may add elements into the<br>
photograph that were not in the original photograph. For example, images of celebrity<br>
persons of public interest, such as politicians, entertainers, sports stars, and the like may be<br>
inserted into the photograph in such a way that they appear to be standing with the people<br>
in the original photograph. Images of other objects may also be inserted into the<br>
photograph to add interest or humor. This mechanism may simply copy silhouettes into<br>
the original photograph. The position where the silhouette is inserted may be fixed, or<br>
provisions can be made to enable the subscriber to designate the desired position using his<br><br>
mobile phone. For example, after a photograph is taken with the camera-enabled mobile<br>
phone, or when a preview image is received, a small application in the mobile phone is<br>
started. The subscriber marks the desired position of the silhouette in the picture with a<br>
small cursor. This information may be transferred to the MMS+ service provider via a<br>
separate data message such as a Short Message Service (SMS) message, or the data may<br>
be included in the picture itself. The MMS+ service provider retrieves this information<br>
and positions the silhouette accordingly. This process may alternatively be used to<br>
reposition a stenciled area within the photograph.<br>
The image database may contain pictures for different camera types or lens focal lengths.<br>
Therefore, the camera-enabled mobile phone may also send to the MMS+ service<br>
provider, other information such as the camera type, lens focal length, resolution, and<br>
distance to the person in the photograph. This information enables the MMS+ service<br>
provider to utilize stored perspective information to select and paste an image with an<br>
appropriate scale into the photograph.<br>
The camera-enabled mobile phone may also download or otherwise contain an editing<br>
application that provides the subscriber with greater editing capabilities. The editing may<br>
be performed in the phone, or the application may enable the subscriber to indicate desired<br>
editing changes to the MMS+ service provider, which then performs the actual editing and<br>
returns the edited photograph to the subscriber for review. For example, a building of<br>
particular interest may appear in the background of the photograph, but the building is too<br>
small. The editing application enables the subscriber to crop the photograph and enlarge<br>
the building so that people in the foreground appear to be standing closer to the building.<br>
If the MMS+ service provider performs the editing, the subscriber may place a cursor on<br>
the building and click a command to zoom. The photograph and editing commands are<br>
then sent to the MMS+ service provider, which performs the manipulation and returns the<br>
photograph to the subscriber for review. Other types of editing and special effects such as<br>
wide angle or fisheye lens effect can also be performed.<br>
FIG. 3 is a flow chart illustrating the steps of the preferred embodiment of the method of<br>
the present invention. At step 51, an originating mobile subscriber (MO) prepares to take<br><br>
a photograph using a camera-enabled mobile phone. Deferred location reporting may be<br>
utilized to guide the MO to places for which manipulated photographs are available<br>
through the enhanced MMS+ service, and to inform the MO of the direction of sight for<br>
which the images are available. Alternatively, marks may be placed on the ground<br>
identifying positions and directions of sight for which manipulated photographs are<br>
available through the enhanced MMS+ service. At step 52, the MO takes a photograph<br>
with the camera-enabled phone. At step 53, instead of sending the photograph through the<br>
default MMS center, the photograph is sent to an MMS+Center capable of manipulating<br>
photographs. The MO's location information is sent along with the photograph.<br>
Additionally, the MMS+ database may contain pictures for different camera types or lens<br>
focal lengths. Therefore, other information such as, for example, the camera type, lens<br>
focal length, and distance to the person in the photograph may be sent to the<br>
MMS+Center. This information enables the MMS+Center to select and paste an image<br>
with an appropriate scale into the photograph.<br>
At step 54, instead of immediately sending an M-Notification.ind message to the MT, the<br>
MMS+Center accesses the database and may manipulate the photograph with images from<br>
the database to create one or more preview versions. Many methods that are used by<br>
today's picture or film editing programs for PCs can be applied by the MMS+Center to<br>
automatically manipulate the photograph. At step 55, the MMS+Center sends one or more<br>
of the previews back to the MO for review. The previews may be sent one at a time or,<br>
optionally, several previews may be sent in one image. Alternatively, descriptive text may<br>
be sent, enabling the MO to select previews that he wants to review. At step 56, the MO<br>
selects one of the previews and requests it from the MMS+Center. The request may be<br>
made by sending an SMS message to the MMS+Center. At step 57, the MMS+Center<br>
receives the request and sends the requested manipulated photograph to the MO. At step<br>
58, the MO receives the manipulated photograph and at step 59 sends it via the<br>
MMS+Center or a regular MMC to the MT.<br>
There are several alternative points during the process at which the MO may be billed for<br>
the service. For example, he may be billed when he sends the photograph to the<br>
MMS+Center requesting manipulation. Alternatively, the MO may be billed later, only if<br><br>
he likes and selects one of the previews.<br>
FIG. 4 is a message flow diagram illustrating the flow of messages between network<br>
elements when a multimedia message such as a photograph is manipulated by an enhanced<br>
MMS+Center and then sent from an MO 61 to an MT 32 in accordance with the teachings<br>
of the present invention. The MO originates the process by sending a M-Send.req<br>
message 62 to an enhanced MMS+Center 63 via a WAP Gateway/Push Proxy. The MO<br>
modifies the M-Send.req message in the present invention to include location information<br>
for the MO and, optionally, camera-type information. The MMS+Center sends an M-<br>
Sendxonf response message 64 back to the MO with an indication that previews are<br>
available. The MO sends a WSP GET.req message 65 to the MMS+Center, and the<br>
MMS+Center sends the downloaded previews to the MO in an M-Retrieve.conf message<br>
66. The MO then reviews the previews and sends a preview selection to the MMS+Center<br>
in an M-Send.req message 67.<br>
The MMS+Center 63 then sends an M-Notification.ind message 68 to the MT 32 via a<br>
HTTP/PUSH through the WAP Gateway 38. The M-Notification.ind message informs the<br>
MT that a multimedia message is available for retrieval. The MT sends an M-Notify<br>
Response.ind 69 to the MMS+Center indicating that the M-Notification.ind message was<br>
received. At some time later, when the MT desires to retrieve the multimedia message,<br>
the MT sends a WSP GET.req message 70 to the MMS+Center. In response, the<br>
MMS+Center sends to the MT an M-Retrieve.conf message 71, which contains the<br>
manipulated photograph sent by the MO. The MT then sends an M-Acknowledge.ind<br>
message 72 to the MMS+Center when the multimedia message is successfully received.<br>
The MMS+Center may optionally send an M-Delivery.ind message 73 back to the MO<br>
indicating that the delivery was made.<br>
FIG. 5 is a simplified block diagram of an embodiment of the enhanced MMS+Center of<br>
the present invention. With reference to FIGS. 4 and 5, the operation of the MMS+Center<br>
will now be explained. The MO 61 sends a M-Send.req message 62 to the enhanced<br>
MMS+Center 63 with the photograph that the subscriber has taken. The MO modifies the<br>
M-Send.req message in the present invention to include location information for the MO<br><br>
and, optionally, camera-type information. The MMS+Center determines in a decision<br>
function 81 whether the M-send.req message is requesting normal forwarding or MMS+<br>
services. If the message does not include location information, the decision function may<br>
determine that normal forwarding is being requested, and the message and photograph are<br>
sent to a normal MMS forwarding function 82. However, if the message includes location<br>
information, the decision function may determine that MMS+ services are being<br>
requested. In this case, the decision function forwards the message to an information<br>
extractor 83. The information extractor extracts the location information and converts it to<br>
an ID format suitable for entering an image database 84. If the camera type is also<br>
included in the M-Send.req message, the camera information may also be sent to the<br>
database.<br>
The photograph, and optionally the camera type, are sent to a photograph manipulator 85.<br>
The photograph manipulator may include a background image replacer 86; a color,<br>
brightness, and sharpness enhancer 87; and an image inserter 88 as previously described.<br>
Images from the image database 84 are supplied to the photograph manipulator, if<br>
available. If images are available and/or other manipulation can be performed, the<br>
photograph manipulator informs a preview controller 89 that one or more previews are<br>
available. The preview controller notifies the MO 61 that previews are available, and if<br>
the MO requests them, they are sent in the M-Retrieve.conf message 66 to the MO. The<br>
MO then reviews the previews and sends a preview selection to the MMS+Center in the<br>
M-Send.req message 67. The preview controller 89 then sends the requested photograph<br>
to the normal MMS forwarding function 82 for forwarding to the MT 32, as shown in<br>
steps 68-73 of FIG. 4.<br>
The process described above for still photographs can also be utilized to modify video<br>
and/or audio sequences. Thus, streaming video taken by a mobile device and sent to an<br>
MMS+Center can be modified to manipulate or enhance the quality of the video. For<br>
example, if a short film is made of a person standing in front of a sight seeing attraction,<br>
the MMS+Center can add images to the video sequence in such a way that a famous<br>
celebrity appears to walk through the background of the film. If the video has associated<br>
audio, the audio can also be modified.<br><br>
As will be recognized by those skilled in the art, the innovative concepts described in the<br>
present application can be modified and varied over a wide range of applications.<br>

ABSTRACT<br><br><br>
SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR AUTOMATIC MODIFICATION OF MULTIMEDIA<br>
MESSAGES<br>
An enhanced Multimedia Messaging Service Center (MMS+Center) that<br>
manipulates photographs contained in MMS messages sent from camera-enabled mobile<br>
phones. The Center receives an original photograph in an MMS message together with<br>
location information for the camera-enabled mobile phone. Utilizing the location<br>
information, an image associated with the location of the mobile phone is extracted from<br>
an image database. A photograph manipulator creates a modified photograph by pasting<br>
the extracted image into the original photograph. A preview of the modified photograph is<br>
sent to the mobile phone for review. If the preview is approved, the MMS+Center sends<br>
the modified photograph to the recipient.</td>
