METHOD TO ASSESS SURFACTANT ADSORPTION ON SKIN<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
5  Field of the Invention<br>
The invention relates to a" test method for estimating the level of residual surfactant on the skin.<br>
10  The Related Art<br>
Personal cleansing products are frequently marketed based on their degree of mildness to the skinof the user. Unfortunately, many surfactants in common use tend bind to<br>
15  the skin proteins, which can result in skin irritation. Moreover different surfactants bind to skin proteins to varying degrees.  Cleansers that do not leave residual surfactants on the skin are therefore more desirable to many consumers.  At least one test has been disclosed for<br>
20  evaluating the amount of dye and/or pigment binding to skin and evaluating the extent of skin adsorption of surfactant which interferes with dye and/or pigment binding.  However there has not been a convenient way for the consumer to ascertain how a particular cleanser will interact with their<br>
25  skin using a particular cleansing method until now.<br>
A diagnostic test is disclosed by Imokawa and Mishima, Contact Dermatitis 5:357-366, (1979) which uses dye to determine whether or not skin has appreciable amounts of 30  adsorbed surfactant.  The disclosed test uses dye solutions<br><br>
WO 2007/104396<br><br>
PCT/EP2007/001165<br><br>
-   2   -<br>
which are not convenient or appropriate when developing a convenient method intended for consumer use.<br>
A convenient method for detecting and quantifying residual 5  surfactants  has been discovered that employs soluble or dispersible solid or semisolid films as dye and/or pigment carriers where the dye and/or pigment(s) have an affinity for either the skin or the surfactant left on the skin. Although not wishing to be bound to the following theory, it<br>
10  is believed that in a first case where a dye and/or pigment has an affinity for the skin but not for the residual surfactant of interest, application of the dye and/or pigment to skin with residual surfactant will result in skin with less coloration then to skin without the residual<br>
15  surfactant.  In a second case where a dye and/or pigment has an affinity for the residual surfactant of interest but not for the skin, application of the dye and/or pigment to skin with residual surfactant will result in skin with more coloration then to skin without the residual surfactant.<br>
20  Both cases assume that neither the surfactant nor the reagent which removes the film/coating alters the skin itself in a way that changes the skin's propensity to interact with a given dye or pigment independently of the amount of surfactant adsorbed onto the skin.<br>

contained in the film or coating contact the skin area on which the film or coating has been placed and are visible. Advantageously this time can be in the range of about 0.5 to 10 seconds while contacted with the first reagent.  The time 5  may be shortened if the first reagent is used at an elevated temperature.  Release is here defined as allowing at least about 50  % of the dye(s) and/or pigment{s) in the film to contact the skin next to the film in about 5 seconds when the film is contacted by a suitable first reagent having an 10  affinity for the film at 25  C.<br>
When the first reagent contains water, materials that may be used to make the water soluble or dispersible solid or semisolid films or coatings of this invention include well<br>
15  known water soluble or dispersible resins, such as pullulan, other water soluble/dispersible polysaccharides and derivatives thereof, water soluble/dispersible cellulosic derivatives and the like.  Other suitable resins are described in Davidson and Sittig, Water - Soluble Resins,<br>
20  Van Nostrand Reinhold Company, New York (1968), herein<br>
incorporated by reference. The water-soluble or dispersible resin should have useful characteristics such as sufficient water solubility or dispersibility so as to quickly release the dye and/or pigment contained within the film, and<br>
25  sufficient strength and pliability in order to permit machine handling while trimming and packaging without tearing.  Other preferred water-soluble or dispersible resins include polyvinyl alcohol, cellulose ethers, polyethylene oxide, starch, polyvinylpyrrolidone,<br>
30  polyacrylamide, polyvinyl methyl ether-maleic anhydride, polymaleic anhydride, styrene maleic anhydride.<br><br>

Other useful films include those that are either oil soluble/dispersible, alcohol soluble/dispersible, or<br>
10  soluble/dispersible in any reagent(s) that is/are safe for contact with human or animal skin.  Oils may consist of one or more mineral, glyceride, silicone or any other suitable oil or a blend thereof.  Alcohols may include one or more monohydric or polyhyric alcohols, polyols or blends thereof<br>
15  and the like.  Suitable film examples include water/alcohol-soluble or water/alcohol-dispersible polymers that can be fashioned into films such as<br>
octylacrylamide/acrylates/butylaminoethyl methacrylate copolymer neutralized with a base such as<br>
20  aminomethylpropanol, alcohol-soluble polyamides, polyethers of 2,2- bis (4-hydroxyphenyl) propane and epichlorohydrin, and the like.  Suitable oil soluble polymers that can be used in films include vinyl polymers such as polymers derived from the polymerization of at least one monoethylenically<br>
25  unsaturated alkyl (meth) acrylic monomer, preferably, an<br>
alkyl (meth)acrylic acid ester (i.e., an alkyl acrylate or alkyl methacrylate) , wherein the alkyl group has at least 4 carbon atoms (on average) and preferably no greater than 22 carbon atoms (on average), and at least one<br>

Depending on the properties of the resultant polymer, the monoethylenically unsaturated alkyl (meth)acrylic acid esters used to prepare the polymer can have just short alkyl groups {e.g., at least 5  4 carbon atoms (on average) and preferably no greater than 14 carbon atoms {on average)), or just long alkyl groups (e.g., at least 15 carbon atoms (on average) and preferably no greater than 22 carbon atoms (on average)), or mixtures of monoethylenically unsaturated alkyl (meth)acrylic acid<br>
10  esters with short alkyl groups can be used in combination<br>
with monoethylenically unsaturated alkyl (meth)acrylic acid esters with long alkyl groups (e.g., terpolymers). The alkyl group can optionally contain heteroatoms (e.g., N, O, or S) and can be linear, branched, or cyclic.   Other suitable<br>
15  vinyl polymers include polyethylene having a molecular weight of 2000 to 8000, polystyrene or poly alpha methylstyrene, block copolymers of styrene with ethylene, propylene and/or butalene, copolymers of polyvinylpyrrolidone with polyethylene and the like.<br>

Temporary tattoos<br>
In a second preferred embodiment, a temporary tattoo may be advantageously employed to ascertain the residual surfactant 30  level on the skin.  The dye(s) and/or pigment(s) will<br>
advantageously have an affinity, for either the surfactant or<br><br>

the skin and will be incorporated in the temporary tattoo. There are three principle types of temporary tattoo which differ in the way they are applied to the skin. In a non-limiting manner, it is useful to classify temporary tattoos s  as:  1) those which are hand-painted or drawn directly on the skin;  2) those which are printed (or hand- painted or drawn) onto a substrate and then transferred to the skin some time later; and  3) those which are printed (or hand-painted or drawn) onto a transparent substrate which is 10  subsequently adhered onto the skin.   Preferably the<br>
transparent substrate is soluble or dispersible in water, alcohol, oil or another reagent that is safe for skin contact.<br>
is  For a type 1 temporary tattoo, the artwork is applied to the skin with brushes and/or pens or similar implements, using inks or dye(s) and/or pigments, in a fashion analagous to making an illustration on paper. A stencil can be used. For a type 2 temporary tattoo, the artwork is usually<br>
20  printed in ink or dye and/or pigment onto a substrate (such as  paper) having properties which allow the artwork to become dissociated from the substrate, some time after the printing, and transferred to skin {such examples have alternative names such decalcomania, decal or transfer).<br>
25  This transference is most commonly achieved by placing the printed substrate on the skin with the substrate uppermost and then wetting the substrate and applying gentle pressure before peeling off the substrate, leaving the artwork adhered to the skin. Clearly, the substrate, inks and dye<br>
3 0  and/or pigments must be selected such that they have properties which are appropriate to the transference<br><br>

procedure. Alternatively, there may be a transparent layer which covers the surface of the substrate and on top of which the artwork is printed. In this case, the transparent layer is transferred to the skin along with the artwork and 5  thereafter forms a protective cover for the artwork, being uppermost on the skin when the substrate is peeled away. Alternatively, a transparent protective layer may be applied to the tattoo after transfer of the artwork to the skin by covering the artwork with a strip of transparent material or<br>
10  else by applying the transparent layer in the form of a solution from which the layer is deposited on the tattoo after evaporation of the solvent. A transparent protective layer may also be applied to a type 1 temporary tattoo by these methods.   For a type 3 temporary tattoo, the artwork<br>
15  is usually printed in ink or dye and/or pigment onto a transparent substrate which has an adhesive area that exceeds, overlaps or surrounds the artwork and assists, or is responsible for, its adherence to the skin (these may be alternatively called stickers). A type 3 temporary tattoo is<br>
20  adhered onto the skin such that the artwork is in contact<br>
with the skin and the transparent substrate often provides a protective adhesive layer.<br>
A temporary tattoo (of any type) which is to be used for 25  skin testing according to the invention may also be produced so that certain designated areas of the artwork contain different test dye and/or pigment compounds.  Different areas could also contain the same test dye and/or pigment compound or material but at different concentrations. The 3 0  person carrying out the test would in one embodiment keep a careful record or "tattoo map" detailing the precise<br><br>

distribution of the test dye and/or pigment materials in the tattoo. After the time allotted for the test, the tattoo may be partially or completely removed with an appropriate reagent or blend of reagents and the skin underneath 5  examined for any signs of reaction or adsorption of the dye and/or pigment. Comparing signs of residual surfactant or the lack thereof (e.g. skin coloration) with the map will enable the estimation (and optionally the distribution) of the residual surfactants on the skin.<br>

The following examples will more fully illustrate the embodiments of this invention.  All parts, percentages and proportions referred to herein and in the appended claims are by weight unless otherwise illustrated.  Physical test 20  methods are described below:<br>
Example: 1<br>
Indigo carmine (2-(1,3-Dihydro-3-oxo-5-sulfo-2H-indol-2-25  ylidene)-2,3-dihydro-3-oxo-lH-indole-5-sulfonic acid<br>
disodium salt), an acid dye also known as FD&amp;C Blue No. 2 (C.I. 73015), was employed in solution form to compare levels of residual surfactants remaining on the skin of three individual panelists after cleansing using both pure 30  surfactant sample solutions and also samples of various commercially available toilet bars on multiple sites of<br><br>

their forearms according the procedure described below and the results are summarized in Figs. 1 to 4 and Table 1.  It was found that the dye coloration intensity increased with decreasing surfactant binding i.e. sodium dodecyl sulfate 5  (SDS) (least stain uptake) &gt; Sulfosuccinate &gt; Water &gt; Alkyl polyglucoside (APG) (most stain uptake).  While not wishing to be bound by the following theory,  it is believed that lipid removal by APG directly from the skin results in exposure of more skin protein binding sites to the dye,<br>
10  hence the greater intensity of coloration independent of surfactant adsorbtion.  Another way of expressing the foregoing sequence {except for APG) is as follows: a. Little to no staining: Greatest surfactant binding; b. Weak staining: Moderate surfactant binding; c. Strong staining:<br>
15  Less surfactant binding; d. Strong staining: Water Control. The actual skin staining results are illustrated in Fig. 2.<br>
Especially indicative of surfactant/dye binding is the b* value, the lower the number means the skin is bluer i.e.  as<br>
20  the  b* scale decreases the color changes from yellow to blue so a lower number means bluer.  It was expected that the water treated site should have the lowest number as this situation allows for the most dye molecules to bind to the skin (in the absence of adsorbed surfactant).  The untreated<br>
25  site, which had no stain applied, was expected to have the largest b* value (most yellow). Since soap molecules are known to bind to most of the skin proteins there is little opportunity for the dye to bind to the skin.  The soap treated site will therefore be similar to the untreated<br>
30  control site.  Dove(r) was found to be slightly better than Olay(r) with respect to surfactant binding to the skin.<br><br>

Expressed in order of increasing intensity of dye staining, the results of the toilet bar testing are as follows: Ivory ® Little to no staining: (Greatest surfactant binding); Dove ® Moderate staining (Less surfactant binding); Olay ®<br>
5  Moderate staining: (Less surfactant binding); and Water -Strongest staining: Water Control (no surfactant binding). While not wishing to be bound by the following theory, it is believed that soap binds to the skin more strongly than sodium cocoyl isethionate (SCI) found in syndet toilet bars<br>
o  such Dove(r) and Olay(r) .  Soap is also known to be more irritating than SCI.<br>

5  Zein test method<br>
The cleanser containing the anionic surfactant to be tested preferably have a zein solubility of greater than  10, 20, 30, 40 or 50 using the zein solubility method set forth 10  below. The greater the zein score, the more harsh the<br>
cleansing base/surfactant  is considered to be. This method involves measuring the solubility of zein (corn protein) in cleansing base solutions containing the anionic surfactant of interest as follows:<br>
15<br>
0.3 g of cleansing base and 29.7 g of water are mixed thoroughly. To this is added 1.5 g of zein, and mixed for 1 hour.  The mixture is then centrifuged for 30 minutes at 3000 rpm. After centrifugation,. the pellet is extracted, 20  washed with water, and dried in a vacuum oven for 24 hours until substantially all the water has evaporated. The weight of the dried pellet is measured and percent zein solubilized is calculated using the following equation: .<br><br>
