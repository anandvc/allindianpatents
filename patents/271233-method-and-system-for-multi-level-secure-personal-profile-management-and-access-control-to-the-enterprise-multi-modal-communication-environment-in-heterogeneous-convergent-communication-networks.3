METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR MULTI-LEVEL SECURE PERSONAL PROFILE MANAGEMENT AND ACCESS CONTROL TO THE ENTERPRISE MULTI-MODAL COMMUNICATION ENVIRONMENT IN HETEROGENEOUS CONVERGENT COMMUNICATION NETWORKS<br>
Reference to Prior Applications<br>
This application claims the benefit of a previously filed U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/755,734 filed on December 29, 2005, and entitled "Method and Apparatus for Adaptive Management of Multi-Modal Secure Service Point in Heterogeneous Converged Communication Networks" and further claims the benefit of a previously filed U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/755,472 filed on December 29, 2005, and entitled "Method and System for Secure Centralized Multi-Modal User Authentication Over Heterogeneous Convergent Communication Networks".<br>
1<br><br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates generally to the field of voice-over-Internet-Protocol (VoIP) and particularly to IP telephones, capably processing, receiving and transferring voice, data and/or video streams, and being secure and controlled for secure profile management and convergent communications.<br>
Description of the Prior Art<br>
With the advent of the Internet and particularly its popularity within the recent decade, information, in its multitude of forms, is commonly transferred in various forms using the Internet. This method of communication offers users a cost-effective, flexible and oftentimes convenient approach to information transfer. What is of particular interest is the use of telephones or voice-enabled communication terminals throughout the Internet for transfer of voice, data and/or video streams. In fact, many communication terminals may be placed at various remote locations relative to each other throughout the Internet cloud thereby allowing users to communicate to one another through the Internet.<br>
The use of IP telephones - telephones using Internet Protocol (IP) to communicate over the Internet, any local area network or any other IP network-currently offers less security than that of conventional telephones in the Public Switching Telephone Network. Security, remote access and controllability of communications terminals within the Internet are therefore highly desirable.<br>
2<br><br>
The need therefore arises for secure access and optionally remote control to voice-enabled communications terminals, such as IP phones, which are remotely located to one another allowing multiple users to communicate using VoIP using multi-level security to avoid unauthorized access to the functions of the communications terminal.<br>
3<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Briefly, an embodiment and method of the present Invention includes securely accessing a voice-enabled communication terminal using Internet Protocol by performing physical authentication, performing logical authentication, performing biometric authentication and performing authentication of a user and upon successful confirmation of the user, allowing access to the communication terminal.<br>
The foregoing and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will be apparent from the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments which make reference to several figures of the drawing.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Referring now to Figs. 1 (a) - (d), a secure service point (SSP) system 10 is shown with different configurations represented in each of the foregoing figures, in accordance with various embodiments of the present invention. In Fig. l(a), the SSP system 10 is shown to include an IP telephone 12, a secure personal authentication reader (SPAR) device 14, a network switch 16 and an IP network line 18, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. The IP telephone 12 is merely an example of a voice-enabled communication terminal; accordingly, any voice-enabled network device capable of being controlled remotely may be used in place thereof. The terms "IP telephone" and "VoIP telephone" are used interchangeably herein.<br>
The SPAR device 14 in each of the Figs. l(a) - (d) includes one or more readers with each reader generally being of a different type. In the figures, the SPAR device 14 is shown to include a number of readers, which are each readers 20 - 26. It should be noted that the SPAR device 14, while shown in the figures to include four readers, may include any number of readers. Furthermore, each of the readers 20 - 26 may be of a different type, such a smart card reader, a biometric reader, a magnetic card or RFID, or of similar type. Examples of a reader are card readers, smart card readers, biometric reader or Radio Frequency Identification (RFID). The choice of which combination of readers to use is one of design. Nonetheless, these readers are utilized for confirmation of the identity of a user in various ways, such as a fingerprint if the biometric reader is employed, which will be discussed further in relation to levels of security shortly.<br>
Moreover the SPAR device 14 may include any combination of 3rd party magnetic card reader, smart card reader, RFID reader, any type of biometric information reader<br>
6<br><br>
(fingerprint, palm print, iris/retina reader) and any type of keyboard input device, and is capable of reading, capturing and securely transmitting the captured authentication information to an IP network using either wired or wireless connection, as will become further evident shortly.<br>
The readers 20 -26 can be coupled to the network line 18 individually and independently, directly or using the switch 16. Moreover, they can be combined into one enclosure and coupled directly to the network line 18, as shown in Figs. l(a) and l(c) or coupled through a built-in Ethernet port 30 on the telephone 12, as shown in Fig. l(b) or couple to a built-in RS-232 port 32 on the telephone 12, as shown in Fig. l(d).<br>
In Fig. l(a), the telephone 12 and the SPAR device 14 are shown coupled to the switch 16, which is, in turn, shown coupled to the network line 18. The device 14 is generally affixed or in some manner connected to the telephone 12 at a location, for example, to the side or top or bottom of the telephone. An example location of the device 14 is at 34.<br>
The SPAR device 14 can be associated with a wired or wireless IP telephone, such as the IP telephone 12, either by connection to the IP telephone through a dedicated RS-232 port on the phone, by connection to the IP network through a network switch on the IP phone, or by connection to the IP network through a physical connection separate from the IP telephone so that the user can use the keypad on the IP telephone as a keyboard input device and can use the IP telephone as a multi-modal communication device during an authentication procedure. The combination of the IP telephone and the SPAR device 14 is, at times, referred to as "Secure Service Access Point" (SSAP).<br>
7<br><br>
In the case where the readers of the device 14 are individually coupled through the switch 16, to the network line 18, such as shown in Fig. l(a), different types of readers are clearly available for identification, whereas, in the case where one or fewer than the number of readers available are coupled through the switch 16 to the network line 18, clearly fewer readers are available for identifying a user. In Fig. l(d), the connection of the device 14 to the network line 18 is through the telephone 12 and no switch is employed.<br>
In Fig. l(d), a connection 36 couples the device 14 to the telephone 12 and in one embodiment of the present invention, the connection 36 is a serial connection, such as RS-232. In Fig. l(b), a connection 38 couples the device 14 to the telephone 12 and in one embodiment of the present invention, it is a IP or network connection.<br>
Some of the capabilities and/or functions of the system 10, while not limited to the same, are enumerated as follows:<br>

4.	Ability to support enhanced security and access control based on the pre-defined<br>
limits of secure session duration, ensuring that any user would be automatically<br>
logged out after certain idle time<br>
5.	Ability to act as an industry-standard Presence Agent that is capable of aggregating<br>
information related to user presence and publish it to any industry-standard 3rd party<br>
Presence Server based on the authenticated profile, business rules, policies and<br>
permissions, and location of the originating SSAP device<br>
9<br><br>
6.	Ability to act as a multi-modal interactive front-end view and controller to a third<br>
party   Customer   Relationship   Management   (CRM)   system   and/or   Employee<br>

business rules and policies) the type of requested CRM/ERM service, and ability to<br>
execute automated multi-modal interaction session with the user (according to the<br>
said CRM/ERM service scenario) using SSP as a communication   terminal that<br>
according to its capabilities supports various modes of interactions with the user,<br>
including (but not limited to) reading of the aforementioned physical tokens, data<br>
input using IP telephone screen, speech input using third party Automated Speech<br>
Recognition (ASR) system, DTMF input, Text-To-Speech (TTS) conversions, etc.<br>
7.	Ability (by use of industry-standard third party call control and media control<br>

Fig. 2 shows a multi-modal service-point convergent communication system 40 in accordance with an application of the system 10 of Figs. l(a) - (d). The system 40 is generally utilized for secure personal profile management and access control to the enterprise communication and business services over a convergent network, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
The system 40 is shown to include a location 1 intended to refer to a location in which the structures (or similar structures) included therein are present, a primary MAP environment 42, a LAN 125 and a third party user management and access control environment 44 and counterparts thereto shown on the left side of the figure, as location 2, which is a counterpart to location 1, a backup MAP environment 48, which is a counterpart to the primary MAP environment 42 and a third party enterprise business services environment 50, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Location 1 is an exemplary embodiment, shown to include an IP PBX and IP media gateway 101 combined with IP/PSTN gateway 102 (at times referred to as a "Softswitch") which provides the functionality of a traditional telephone PBX in a modular, open and distributed fashion, including comprehensive call control operations (call setup, teardown, transfer, conference, etc.) and voice traffic/media control and management (establishing audio streams between participating communication end points, mixing the said streams in case of call conference, redirecting the said streams in case of call transfer, etc.) and is coupled through a voice LAN (VLAN) 104 to four<br>
11<br><br>
Secure Profile Management Point (SPM) points 112, 110, 113 and 111. While four SPM points are shown in Fig. 2, any number thereof may be employed without departing from the scope and spirit of the present invention.<br>
In each SPM point, there is shown an IP telephone and a SPAR device. For example, the SPM point 112 includes an IP telephone 105 and a SPAR device 108 and the SPM point 110 includes an IP telephone 105 and a SPAR device 106 and the SPM point 113 includes an IP telephone 105 and a SPAR device 115 and the SPM point 111 includes an IP telephone 105 and a SPAR device 107. The IP telephones and SPAR devices of each of the SPM points 112, 110, 113 and 111 resemble that of the IP telephone 12 and the SPAR devices 14 of Figs. l(a) - (d) with the SPAR devices of each of the SPM points having a unique configuration among the various available configurations thereof, as discussed with reference to Figs. l(a) - (d). For example, in Fig. 2, the device 108 of the SPM point 112 includes a smart card reader, card reader, an RFID and a biometric reader whereas the device 106 only includes a biometric reader and so on.<br>
An example of a component in the environments 44 and 50 is, for example Microsoft Office Active Directory by Microsoft, Inc. of Seattle, Washington as the LDAP 120. Basically, they offer business functionality.<br>
The VLAN 104 is shown further coupled to the SPM points 112, 110, 113 and 111 and couples these SPM points to the IP PBX and media gateway 101, which is, in turn, coupled, through the VLAN 104 to the IP/PSTN gateway 102. The gateway 102 is coupled, through a ISDN PRI trunk 103, to the PSTN cloud 127, thereby PSTN phones 128 to communicate with the IP telephone of any of the SPM points using VoIP, which is less costly and allows further flexibility and options, as will become evident shortly. The<br>
12<br><br>
VLAN 104 is further employed to couple the gateways 101 and 102 to the LAN/Wide Area Network (WAN) 126.<br>
Location 2 includes similar structures as that shown and discussed relative to Location 1, such as the IP/PSTN gateway 202, which is similar to the gateway 102 of Location 1, an IP PBX and media gateway 201, similar to the gateway 101 of Location 1, the combination of the gateway 201 and the gateway 202 functions substantially as a Softswitch. The SPM points 210, 212, 211 and 213 are similar to that shown and discussed of the SPM points 112, 110, 113 and 111 of Location 1. VLAN 204 couples the gateway 201 and the SPM points 210, 212, 211 and 213 in the same manner as discussed relative to the Location 1 and the gateway 202 and the gateway 201 are coupled through the VLAN 204 to the PSTN cloud 127 and to the LAN/WAN cloud 126. The VLAN 204 is further employed to couple the gateways 201 and 202 to the LAN/WAN 126. The LAN 125 couples the environment 44 to the environment 42 and further couples the environment 50 to the environment 48.<br>
The environment 42 is shown to include a Text-To-Speech (TTS) server 130, an Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) server 131, a media server 117, a MAP engine 116 and a RDBMS 118. The servers 130 and 131 are shown to be coupled to the VLAN 104 through a local area network connection 114, as are the server 117, the engine 116 and the RDBMS 118, which are shown further coupled, through the connection 114, to the LAN 125.<br>
The environment 48 is shown to include counterpart components to that of the components of the environment 42 because the environment 48 essentially serves as a backup environment to the environment 42 in the event a problem arises and any of the<br>
13<br><br>
components of the environment 42 become inoperable. Accordingly, the coupling of the servers and/or engines of the environment 48 are the same as that of the environment. For example, the media server 217, the MAP engine 216, the TTS server 230 and the ASR server 231 are shown coupled through a local area network (LAN) connection 214 to the VLAN 204 of Location 2 and the server 217 and engine 216 are further shown coupled, through the connection 214, to the environment 50.<br>
The environment 44 is shown to include a security/authentication server 119, a directory (LDAP) 120 and a presence server 121, which are each coupled, through the connection 114 and the LAN 125, to the environment 42. The environment 50 is shown to include a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) 122, a Business Process Management and Automation (BPMA) 123 and a groupware 124, which are each shown coupled through the connection 214 and the LAN 225, to the environment 48.<br>
The structures or components with each of the Locations 1 and 2 are referred to as communication components and each communication component shown at the Location 1 has its matching counterpart at the Location 2 and some of the attributes are as follows:<br>
•	IP PBX combined with IP Media Gateway  101  (201) and connected to a<br>
dedicated Voice LAN 104 (204)<br>
•	Voice-over-IP   telephones   of  various   types   105   (205)   connected   to   the<br>
corresponding Voice LAN 104 (204)<br>
•	IP/PSTN Gateway  102 (202) connected to the Public Switching Telephone<br>
Network (PSTN) 127 via ISDN PRI trunks 103 (203) to support connectivity<br>
14<br><br>
between the IP PBX 101 (201) and various (wireless and wired) PSTN phones 128.<br>
•	Multi-modal  VOIP phones (105, 205) that are capable of handling either<br>
combination of voice, data and video streams (the actual capabilities of these end<br>
points determine the multi-modal streams that would be delivered);<br>
•	Authentication devices (SPAR devices) that perform, among other procedures, the<br>
following authentication procedures: biometric authentication (fingerprint, palm-<br>
print or iris-reader), physical token authentication (magnetic card reader, smart<br>
card reader, RFID reader).<br>
As earlier noted, the SPAR devices can be of different types, including but not limited to, biometric readers (106, 206), smart cards, magnetic cards or RFID readers (107, 207), or to compound devices that may include any combination of Smart Card, Magnetic Card, RFID and Biometric readers in a single unit (108, 208, 109, 209). Accordingly, the SPAR devices can support either separate types of authentication, or if combined in a unit, can perform several types of authentication separately or in combination (as an example of such combination, a biometric reader can be combined with a RFID and/or a smart card reader). The SPAR devices, such as the device 108, 106, 109 or 107 in Fig. 2, are coupled to the enterprise LAN 125 via standard network connection (or the connection 114, an example of which is the RJ-45) (either directly or through the network switch built into the IP phone).<br>
15<br><br>
Typically, each authentication device, such as each SPAR device, is associated with one or more IP telephones, and the logical associations between the SPAR device and the one or more IP telephones is generally stored in an' appropriate software-based persistent storage repository (e.g., relational database, such as the RDBMS 118).<br>
These SPAR devices may reside on the same physical chassis with IP phones or alternatively, they can be physically separated from their associated telephones; any such combination of a SPAR device and IP phone is referred to as "Secure Profile Management Point" (SPM Point) shown on the Fig. 2 as 110-113 and 210-213.<br>
In operation, an authentication session begins when a user swipes (through the use of a magnetic card or RFID card) or enters authentication information (a password) using any of the SPAR devices of, for example, the SPM points 112, 110, 113 or 111. The authentication information is then captured and stored in the engine 116, through the VLAN 104 and the gateway 101 and is sent to the authentication server 119 for identification of the user. Once the user is identified, additional information regarding the user is provided by the Directory Server 120 to the MAP Engine 116. Additional information of the user includes but is not limited to personal and corporate profiles of the user, user permissions within the system. The server 121 provides the present status of the user, such as whether or not the user is available and/or active and the like.<br>
The media server 117 is used to broadcast information, such as audio streams, to the user. The server 130 is used to convert text to audio file. The server 131 is used for speech recognition and the RDBMS 118 is a relational database system for storing of various types of information.<br>
16<br><br>
As previously alluded thereto, due to the mission-critical characteristic of the system 40, the environment 42 is essentially duplicated or its backup preserved by the environment 48. This redundancy is generally required for mission-critical applications.<br>
Assuming a user profile has been created, upon an attempt by the user to access the IP phone, authentication of the user is performed and upon positive authentication of the user, the user profile is retrieved for storage and a telephony configuration of the communication terminal is built according to the stored user profile.<br>
The Customer Relationship Management (CRM) 122, Business Process Management and Automation (BPMA) 123 and groupware 124 of the environment 50 each include various business applications. The PSTN phones 128 can be a landline or a mobile phone or any other conventional type of PSTN telephone. As an example of the processing of a phone call, assuming the call is originated from the IP phone 104, it is transmitted through the gateway 101 to the gateway 102 to the PSTN cloud 127 where the telephone company transfers it to the appropriate PSTN phone and vice versa if the call is originated from the PSTN phone 128.<br>
It will be apparent as well, that the present invention is not limited to a multi-location architecture shown in Fig. 2, but may be applied as well to other arrangements of elements where VOIP-capable communication end points, or communication terminals, (whether in combination with SPAR devices or not) are used to handle multi-modal user interaction sessions including but not limited to internal, external incoming and external outgoing telephone calls, multi-modal broadcasts of data, voice and video streams, presence management and monitoring, etc.<br>
17<br><br>
Also connected to the VLAN 104 (204) and 125 (225) is a processor executing an instance of Multi-modal Application Platform application server 116 (or 216), generally referred to as a MAP Engine. The MAP Engine 116 (216) has several purposes associated with processing user authentication information that comes from any of the SPAR devices on the network. For example, the MAP Engine 116, by communicating with any registered SPAR device, has the capability of:<br>
•	Receive encrypted request from the SPAR device that includes authentication data<br>
•	Identify the type of authentication data<br>
•	Identify the SPAR device that is the source of the request<br>
•	Pass the encrypted authentication data to a 3rd party authentication server<br>
•	Receive response from the authentication server that includes one or more<br>
attributes uniquely identifying the user<br>
•	Retrieve user's personal communication profile and configure the corresponding<br>
IP phone according to this profile<br>
•	Present the user with the list of available communication and business services<br>
according to the user's profile and permissions.<br>
•	Based on the authenticated profile and location of the originating SPAR device<br>
and association of the SPAR device with IP phone, and using unified protocol for<br>
Presence Management (SIMPLE) the said MAP Engine can publish user-related<br>
presence information to any industry-standard 3rd party Presence Server<br>
18<br><br>
•	Based on the authentication profile and type of preconfigured services can initiate<br>
an automated multi-modal session between the user and available/permitted<br>
enterprise communication or business services.<br>
By additional communication with gateway 101 (201) the MAP Engine 116 has the capability of:<br>
•	Configure one or more IP phones according to the user personal profile, taking<br>
into account geographical location of these phones and their association with IP<br>
PBX.<br>
•	For each IP phone (105, 205) configured according to the user's personal profile<br>
exercise control over call functions, media functions and data functions so that the<br>
communication services available to the user would match the related personal<br>
profile and policy-based permissions. Such communication services include but<br>
are not limited to: accepting incoming calls, placing outbound calls, participating<br>
in teleconferences and multi-modal broadcasts, access to various corporate<br>
directories, etc.<br>
Also in this embodiment MAP Engine 116 (216) maintains a peer-to-peer TCP/IP connection to an instance of application known by the inventor as Multi-Modal Media Server 117 (217) (hereafter termed "Media Server"). The said Media Server according to the control requests of the corresponding MAP Engine performs the actual delivery of combined voice, data and video streams to the VOIP phones of supported types and configurations according to the actual capabilities of the participating VOIP phones. The<br>
19<br><br>
Media Server also performs a function of collecting users' input to the data forms supplied to the screen-enabled VOIP phones and passing this data to the MAP Engine, for the latter could process it and generate the subsequent control instructions based on the results of such processing and on relevant static and dynamic configuration data and business rules. There are a number of ways Media Server 118 may be implemented. For example, Media Server may be executed on the same hardware processor that executes the MAP Engine; alternatively it may run on a separate hardware processor independently or as an add-on component of a standard Web application server like Tomcat.<br>
In operation, the system 40 allows for a multi-level secure access of communication terminals, such as the IP telephone 12 of Figs. l(a) - (d). In one embodiment and method of the present invention, there are three levels of security, a physical authentication, a logical authentication and a biometric authentication. Both logical and physical authentications are performed by coordinated actions of MAP Engine (116) and Security and Authentication Server (119); no authentication is performed by the IP Phone; SPAR device associated with (attached to) the phone is used for capturing related authentication tokens and passing them securely to the MAP Engine (116), which in turn processed all captured authentication tokens and passes them to the Security and Authentication server (119).<br>
Fig. 4 shows a system 402 including the system 40 but with another configuration in accordance with an alternate embodiment of the present invention. In the system 402 of Fig. 4, the SPM points or SSP terminals, such as the combination of an IP phone 105 and a SPAR device 108, are shown located remotely and connected, through a Wide Area<br>
20<br><br>
Network (WAN)/Internet cloud 400, to the system 40 or outside of the enterprise located, for example, in a store.<br>
Fig. 4 is a high-level overview of distributed heterogeneous convergent communication infrastructure enhanced with the hardware and software that covers multi-location enterprise (which acts as a business service provider), and includes remote Secure Service Points that are installed outside of the enterprise boundaries in various publicly accessed locations (including but not limited to retail stores, bank branches, hotel lobbies and guest rooms, airport terminals and lounges, public phone booths, etc.) with the goal to deliver various business services to the users using multi-modal interactive sessions according to the business logic controlled in real time from a secure centralized enterprise environment.<br>
Fig. 4 and some of its structure will be explained in reference to Fig. 2, as many of the same structures or components are included in both figures. Each "business service provider" enterprise location includes the following key components of the enterprise convergent communication network (each communication component shown at the location 1 has its matching counterpart at the location 2; the numbering for the Location 1 component start with digit 1, the numbers of the corresponding components at Location 2 start with the digit 2):<br>
•	IP PBX combined with IP Media Gateway 101  (201) and connected to a<br>
dedicated Voice LAN 104 (204)<br>
•	Voice-over-IP Phones of various types 105 (205) connected to the corresponding<br>
Voice LAN 104 (204)<br>
21<br><br>
•	Personal Computers of various types 133 (233) connected to the corresponding<br>
VLAN 104(204) or separate LAN 125 (225)<br>
•	IP/PSTN Gateway 102 (202) connected to the Public 'Service Telephone Network<br>
(PSTN) 127 via ISDN PRI trunks 103 (203) to support connectivity between the<br>
IP PBX 101 (201) and various (wireless and wired) PSTN phones 128.<br>
The present invention assumes a heterogeneous distributed convergent network that contains both LAN/WAN segments (126) and WAN/Internet segments (129); it also contains multiple remote Secure Service Point terminals (110 - 113) connected to the WAN/Internet 129 via standard Ethernet connections 114.<br>
Each remote SSP terminal (110 - 113) contains IP Phone 105 and associated SPAR apparatus (individual or combined, as shown on 106 - 109) described earlier in this embodiment.<br>
Each remote SSP terminal (110 - 113) can perform authentication procedure, the flow of which is controlled by customizable and configurable authentication sequence session that describes which authentication tokens and in which order the user should be challenged with. Depending on this authentication sequence session the involved SSP terminal can encrypt one or several captured authentication tokens at a time and send them securely to the controlling MAP Engine 116 (216), which based on the authentication sequence session would validate the captured authentication tokens perform one of the following three actions:<br>
22<br><br>
1)	Confirm authentication, retrieve user profile and allow access to appropriate<br>
business services; or<br>
2)	Reject authentication and deny access to the system from the involved SSP<br>
terminal; or<br>
3)	Validate available authentication tokens and request more authentication steps<br>
until either action 1) or action 2) would be taken.<br>
Once a positive user authentication is confirmed, the controlling MAP Engine 116 (216) retrieves the authenticated user's profile, determines the type of business service requested by the user (based on the user's permissions and associated business rules and policies), retrieves session scenario description from a permanent storage (RDBMS or file system) and starts multi-modal interactive session acting as an intermediary between the user and back-end enterprise CRM/ERM system that actually controls the requested business service and performs all related business transactions.<br>
The said multi-modal session may consist of any combination of audio (in a form of prepared or TTS-generated audio files), video and data (in a form of text and/or images) streams generated according to the session scenario and sent upstream to the participating SSP Terminal (110 - 113); it would interact with the user by accepting input in multiple formats including (but not limited to) natural speech (processed by an ASR system), DTMF input, data input (using data forms pushed to the IP Phone 105 of the participating<br>
23<br><br>
SSP Terminal) or token input (using the SPAR device 106-109 of the participating SSP Terminal 110-113).<br>
At any moment during such multi-modal interactive session the controlling MAP Engine (either based on the user request or on the session scenario) can:<br>
•	Initiate a phone call from the IP Phone 105 of the participating terminal to an IP<br>
Phone 132 (232) of an available Customer Service Representative (CSR)<br>
•	Aggregate all business data collected up to this moment during the said multi-<br>
modal interactive session;<br>
•	Associate this aggregated data with the call and pass it either to the CSR's IP<br>
Phone 132 (232) or to the associated computer 133 (233)<br>
Should the said CSR decide to transfer the said multi-modal interactive session to another CSR, the controlling MAP Engine (per the former CSR's request) using 3rd party call control and media control functions performs transfer of the session (call, associated data and video stream) to the IP Phone and computer of new designated CSR.<br>
Should the said CSR decide to conference another CSR in the said multi-modal session, the controlling MAP Engine (per the former CSR's request) using 3rd party call control and media control functions performs conference thereby adding IP Phone and computer of the latter CSR to the session so that all session streams (call, associated data and video stream) become available to this new CSR.<br>
24<br><br>
Fig. 5 is a high-level sequence diagram depicting the flow of the session using Secure Service Point and Multi-Modal Application Platform environment of Fig. 4.<br>
The flow starts with User Authentication Request sent by a SSP terminal to the MAP Engine. Having received such request MAP Engine, based on the information sent by the SSP terminal and on other relevant configuration data dynamically identifies correct type of session and initiates it. A sample session flow may look as follows:<br>

Fig. 6 is a high-level overview of distributed heterogeneous convergent communication system 600 enhanced with the hardware and software for Secure Service Access Point operations, provisioning, management and controlled access to the enterprise communication and business services over convergent network according to<br>
27<br><br>
another embodiment of the present invention. The system 600 includes the system 400 and covers multi-location enterprise (which can act as a business service provider), and includes remote Secure Service Access Points that are installed outside of the enterprise boundaries in various publicly accessed locations (including but not limited to retail stores, bank branches, hotel lobbies and guest rooms, airport terminals and lounges, public phone booths, etc.) with the goal to deliver various business services to the users using multi-modal interactive sessions according to the business logic controlled in real time from a secure centralized enterprise environment.<br>
Fig. 7 is a high-level sequence diagram depicting the flow of the multi-level centralized authentication session using Secure Service Access Point and Multi-Modal Application Platform environment of the system 600.<br>
Each "business service provider" enterprise location is shown as a dashed rectangle and contains the following key components of the enterprise convergent communication network (each communication component shown at the location 1 has its matching counterpart at the location 2; the numbering for the Location 1 component start with digit 1, the numbers of the corresponding components at Location 2 start with the digit 2):<br>
•	IP PBX combined with IP Media Gateway  101  (201) and connected to a<br>
dedicated Voice LAN 104 (204)<br>
•	Voice-over-IP Phones of various types 105 (205) connected to the corresponding<br>
Voice LAN 104 (204)<br>
28<br><br>
IP/PSTN Gateway 102 (202) connected to the Public Service Telephone Network (PSTN) 127 via ISDN PRI trunks 132 (232) to support connectivity between the IP PBX 101 (201) and various (wireless and wired) PSTN phones 128.<br>
The present invention assumes a heterogeneous distributed convergent network that contains both LAN/WAN segments (126), wireless access points (125, 225) and WAN/Internet segments (129), and also includes:<br>
•	Multi-modal   VOIP   phones   (105,   205)   that   are   capable   of handling   any<br>
combination of voice, data and video streams (the actual capabilities of these end<br>
points determine the multi-modal streams that would be delivered);<br>
•	The said SPAR authentication devices, whether wired (103, 203) or wireless (104,<br>
204) that are logically and physically associated with IP Phones in a "Secure<br>
Service   Access   Point"   (SSAP)   apparatus   and   can   perform   the   following<br>
authentication procedures: biometric authentication (fingerprint, palm-print or<br>
iris-reader), physical token authentication (magnetic card reader, smart card<br>
reader, RFID reader)<br>
•	Multiple desktop (106, 206) and/or laptop computers (107, 207) connected to the<br>
network segments (104, 204, 126, 129) via wired (114, 214) connections or<br>
wireless access points (125, 225)<br>
•	Multiple remote SSAP terminals (110-113) connected to the WAN/Internet 129<br>
via standard Ethernet connections 114.<br>
29<br><br>
An SSAP apparatus may contain one or more SPAR devices which can be of different types, including but not limited to biometric readers, smart card or magnetic card or RFID readers, or can be combined into compound devices that may include any combination of Smart Card, Magnetic Card, RFID and Biometric readers in a single unit (103). Accordingly an SSAP apparatus can support either separate types of authentication, or can perform several types of authentication alternatively or in combination. An SSAP apparatus is connected to the enterprise LAN either directly or through a standard dedicated Ethernet switch.<br>
Normally each SPAR device would be associated with one or several IP phones and/or with one or several desktop or laptop computers; such logical associations would be stored in an appropriate software-based persistent storage repository (e.g., relational database), so that an SSAP apparatus can contain more than one associated SPAR device, more than one associated IP phones and can be associated with one or several desktop/laptop computers.<br>
The SPAR devices associated with VOIP phones may reside on the same physical chassis with VOIP phones, or can be physically separated from their associated phones; any such logical combination of one or more SPAR devices with one or more IP phones is hereafter termed "Secure Service Access Point" (SSAP) shown on the Fig. 2 as 110 -113 and 210-213.<br>
It will be apparent as well, that the present invention is not limited to a multi-location architecture shown in Fig. 6, but may be applied as well to other arrangements of<br>
30<br><br>
elements where VOIP-capable communication end points (whether included in SSAP apparatuses or not) are used to handle multi-modal user interaction sessions including but not limited to internal, external incoming and external outgoing telephone calls, multi-modal broadcasts of data, voice and video streams, presence management and monitoring, etc.<br>
Also connected to the local area networks 104 (204) and 114 (214) is a processor executing an instance of Multi-modal Application Platform application server 116 (216), known by the inventors as MAP Engine. The MAP Engine 116 (216) has several purposes associated with processing user authentication information that comes from any SSAP apparatus on the network. For example, the said MAP Engine by communicating bi-directionally with any registered SSAP apparatus has the capability:<br>
•	Receive multiple encrypted requests with aggregated or separate authentication<br>
tokens from a registered SSAP apparatus<br>
•	Identify the SSAP apparatus that is a source of the request<br>
•	Parse and decrypt the said authentication tokens<br>
•	Accumulate and aggregate authentication tokens according to the "authentication<br>
scenario" and make positive or negative authentication decisions<br>
•	Pass the encrypted authentication tokens to a 3 rd party authentication server<br>
•	Receive and process according to the "authentication scenario" responses from<br>
the authentication server that contains one or several attributes that uniquely<br>
identify the user<br>
31<br><br>
•	Retrieve user's personal communication profile and, by additional communication<br>
with IP PBX 101 (201) configure the VOIP phone in the corresponding SSAP<br>
apparatus according to this profile, taking into account geographical location of<br>
the SSAP apparatus and appropriate business rules and policies.<br>
•	Present the user with the list of available communication and business services<br>
according to the user's profile and permissions.<br>
•	Based on the authenticated profile and location of the originating SPAR device<br>
and association of the SPAR device with VOIP phone, and using unified protocol<br>
for Presence Management (SIMPLE) the said MAP Engine can publish user-<br>
related presence information to any industry-standard 3rd party Presence Server<br>
•	Based on the authentication profile and type of preconfigured services can initiate<br>
an automated multi-modal session between the user and available/permitted<br>
enterprise communication or business services.<br>
•	Using additional communications with IP PBX 101 (201), for each VOIP phone<br>
(105, 205) configured according to the user's personal profile the said MAP<br>
Engine can exercise control over call functions, media functions and data<br>
functions, so that the communication services available to the user would match<br>
the related personal profile and policy-based permissions. Such communication<br>
services include but are not limited to: accepting incoming calls, placing outbound<br>
calls, participating in teleconferences and multi-modal broadcasts, access to<br>
various corporate directories, etc.<br>
32<br><br>
Also in this embodiment MAP Engine 116 (216) maintains a peer-to-peer TCP/IP connection to an instance of application known by the inventor as Multi-Modal Media Server 117 (217) (hereafter termed "Media Server"). The said Media Server according to the control requests of the corresponding MAP Engine performs the actual delivery of combined voice, data and video streams to the VOIP phones of supported types and configurations according to the actual capabilities of the participating VOIP phones. The Media Server also performs a function of collecting users' input to the data forms supplied to the screen-enabled VOIP phones and passing this data to the MAP Engine, for the latter could process it to generate the subsequent control instructions based on the results of such processing and on relevant static and dynamic configuration data and business rules. There are a number of ways Media Server 117 may be implemented. For example, Media Server may be executed on the same hardware processor that executes the   MAP   Engine;   alternatively   it   may   run   on   a   separate   hardware   processor independently or as an add-on component of a standard Web application server like Tomcat.<br>
Also in this embodiment MAP Engine and Media Server via TCP/IP-based network connection interact with an instance of an industry-standard relational database (RDBMS) 118 (218) that is used as a persistent storage for various data elements to which the MAP Engine 116 (216) and Media Server 117 (217) have read-write access; these data elements include (but are not limited to) system configuration information, real-time status, scheduling and historical data that is used to generate various business rules and interaction scenarios executed by the MAP Engine 116 (216) and the Media<br>
33<br><br>
Server 117 (217), as well as for generation of various historical business reports related to the functions performed by the described system.<br>
Also in this embodiment the same instances of MAP Engine and Media Server can simultaneously communicate with IP PBXs of different vendors, seamlessly delivering the same functionality to associated SSAP apparatuses and automatically adjusting presentation and flow logic to the vendor-specific capabilities of the corresponding SSAP apparatus.<br>
Also in this embodiment MAP Engine and Media Server use well-known industry-standard protocols and technologies for data encryption and secure communications when communicating between themselves, with SPAR devices and any other 3r party components that require and support the data encryption and secure communications. These protocols and technologies include but are not limited to:<br>
•	Transport Layer Security (TLS)<br>
•	Internet Protocol Security (IP-Sec)<br>
•	Secure Socket Layer (SSL) for both HTTP and TCP/IP traffic with up to 128 bit-<br>
based encryption<br>
Also in this embodiment the system may contain one or several hardware processors running some or all of the following industry-standard 3rd party software components:<br>
•	Security and Authentication Server (119) that is used to authenticate the user<br>
based on the authentication data collected and transmitted by a SSAP apparatus<br>
and to provide MAP Engine with the data elements that would uniquely identify<br>
34<br><br>
the user and would allow to retrieve the corresponding personal profiles and permissions<br>
•	LDAP-compliant Directory Server (120) that is use'd as an external persistent<br>
read-only storage of information related to users, departments, groups, and the<br>
corresponding permissions and policies<br>
•	SIMPLE-compliant Presence Server (121) is used to track real-time changes in<br>
the users' presence and availability statuses and to provide real-time notification<br>
about these changes to all      system components (e.g., MAP Engine) that<br>
programmatically registered their interest in such status updates. The said MAP<br>
Engine (116, 216) can publish user-related real-time presence information to the<br>
Presence Server, and can subscribe to it for the purpose of receiving relevant<br>
presence information that may be published by other components.<br>
•	Text-to-Speech Server 130 (230), that converts a typed text into a corresponding<br>
audio file in one of the supported formats (hereafter termed as TTS Server)<br>
•	Automated Speech Recognition Server 131 (231) that in real time analyzes user's<br>
natural speech captured as a digitized audio stream; and sends the recognized data<br>
elements to the MAP Engine (116, 216), thereby allowing for using natural<br>
speech as a mode of communication with the system. For example, the user may<br>
call into the system using PSTN phone 128 or one of the VOIP phones (105, 205),<br>
and after positive authentication can navigate through the available system's<br>
functions using natural speech.<br>
•	Customer  Relationship  Management  (CRM)  and/or  Employee  Relationship<br>
Management (ERM) software system (122) that can be used by the MAP Engine<br>
35<br><br>
(116, 216) to request and deliver relevant business services to an authenticated and authorized user by use of SSAP apparatus as a multi-modal interaction terminal, and to initiate and complete various transactions required by the corresponding business scenarios<br>
•	Business Process Management and Automation (BPMA) software system (123)<br>
that can be used by the MAP Engine (116, 216) to request and deliver relevant<br>
business services to an authenticated and authorized user by use of SSAP<br>
apparatus as a multi-modal interaction terminal, and to initiate and complete<br>
various transactions required by the corresponding business scenarios<br>
•	Various Groupware software (124) that can be used by the MAP Engine (116,<br>
216) to retrieve relevant user, group and calendaring information, and that can<br>
serve as an authenticated client requesting authorized services provided by the<br>
said MAP Engine based on user's profile and related policy-based permissions.<br>
Each remote SSAP terminal (110 - 113) can perform authentication procedure, the flow of which is controlled by customizable and configurable authentication sequence session that describes which authentication tokens and in which order the user should be challenged with. Depending on this authentication sequence session the involved SSAP terminal can encrypt one or several captured authentication tokens at a time and send them securely to the controlling MAP Engine 116 (216), which based on the authentication sequence session would validate the captured authentication tokens perform one of the following three actions:<br>
36<br><br>
1)	Confirm authentication, retrieve user profile and allow access to appropriate<br>
business services; or<br>
2)	Reject authentication and deny access to the system ,lrom the involved SSAP<br>
terminal; or<br>
3)	Validate available authentication tokens and request more authentication steps<br>
until either action 1) or action 2) would be taken.<br>
Once a positive user authentication is confirmed, the controlling MAP Engine 116 (216) retrieves the authenticated user's profile, determines the type of business service requested by the user (based on the user's permissions and associated business rules and policies), retrieves session scenario description from a permanent storage (RDBMS or file system) and starts multi-modal interactive session according to the said session scenario description.<br>
Fig. 7 is a high-level sequence diagram depicting the flow of the multi-level centralized authentication session using Secure Service Access Point and Multi-Modal Application Platform environment of the system 600 of Fig. 6.<br>
The flow starts with User Authentication Token 1 sent by a SSAP terminal to the MAP Engine. Having received such request MAP Engine, based on the information sent by the SSAP terminal and on other relevant configuration data dynamically identifies correct type of session and initiates it. A sample session flow may look as follows:<br>
1.	SSAP Terminal captures and securely submits encrypted User Authentication<br>
Token 1 (e.g., RFID tag)<br>
2.	MAP Engine securely submits the said User Authentication Token 1 received to<br>
the Security and Authentication Server for authentication and authorization<br>
37<br><br>
3.	Security and Authentication Server returns positive authentication of the Token 1<br>
4.	According to the "authentication scenario" MAP Engine requests one or more<br>
additional User Authentication Tokens<br>
5.	SSAP Terminal captures, encrypts and securely submits additional authentication<br>
tokens to the MAP Engine<br>
6.	Once these additional encrypted tokens are received by the MAP Engine, it<br>
securely  re-submits  them  to  the   Security   and   Authentication   Server  for<br>
authentication and authorization<br>
7.	Security and Authentication Server returns separate authentication results for each<br>
authentication token (the steps 4 - 7 are repeated until the user is either rejected or<br>
positively authenticated based on the "authentication scenario")<br>
8.	Once the user has been positively identified, MAP Engine requests the user's<br>
profile from a corresponding directory<br>
9.	LDAP Directory server sends requested data to the MAP Engine<br>
10.	MAP Engine requests the list of available services from the CRM/ERM system<br>
based on the user's profile and associated permissions.<br>
11.	The CRM/ERM system returns the list of services available for the said user to<br>
the MAP Engine<br>
12.	MAP Engine presents the list of available services to the SSAP terminal<br>
13.	The user selects a service and sends service request to the MAP Engine<br>
14.	MAP Engine performs actions related to this service request, including (but not<br>
limited to) reformatting it, and redirects properly formatted service request to the<br>
CRM/ERM system<br>
38<br><br>
15.	The CRM/ERM system returns service response to the MAP Engine<br>
16.	MAP Engine performs actions related to this service response including (but not<br>
limited to) reformatting it according to the SSAP terminal capabilities, and sends<br>
properly formatted service response to the SSAP Terminal<br>
17.	The user continues interaction by sending more service requests<br>
18.	MAP Engine processes these requests as described earlier, and re-directs them to<br>
the CRM/ERM system<br>
19.	The CRM/ERM system returns the corresponding service responses to the MAP<br>
Engine<br>
20.	MAP Engine processes these responses as described earlier, and sends properly<br>
formatted service responses to the SSAP Terminal<br>
21.	The user indicates that the service is complete by sending "Service Complete"<br>
request to the MAP Engine.<br>
22.	MAP Engine notifies the CRM/ERM agent about service completion, completes<br>
the session, frees up all related resources and performs other related required<br>
actions.<br>
