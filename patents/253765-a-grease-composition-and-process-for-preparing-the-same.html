				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to grease, in particular a lubricating grease composition comprising: (a) the reaction product of (i) an overbased containing calcium overbased organic acid; (ii) a compound containing an acid producing group or derivatives thereof; and (b) an oil of lubricating viscosity, wherein the overbased organic acid contains colloidally dispersed calcium carbonate selected from the group consisting of calcite, vaterite and mixtures thereof. The invention further relates to the process to make the grease composition and its use. <br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is known to prepare greases from base oil, an overbased calcium sulphonate thickener as well as conventional thickener such as lithium 12-hydroxy stearate and optionally other performance additives for example antioxidants or antiwear agents. Grease containing an overbased calcium sulphonate thickener is known to have acceptable corrosion inhibiting properties. However, this type of grease has poor water resistance properties such as poor water wash-off or water repellency as shown in an ASTM D4049 water spray-off test. Grease with poor water wash-off or water repellency decreases the longevity of grease and increases wear on the surface being lubricated.<br>
Polymers have also been added to grease, other than overbased calcium sulphonate grease, to improve the performance characteristics of the grease. For example, polymers have been employed to decrease water wash-off, to decrease oil separation, to increase water repellency, to increase dropping points or cone penetration and as thickeners. The polymers are polymethacrylates or polyolefins. Typically these polymers are incorporated in the base oil and act as a viscosity modifier. However, the polymers have limited interaction with the thickener resulting in the grease being more susceptible to the effects of water, for example, water wash-off or decreased water repellency. <br>
US Patent Number 5,308,514 (Olson et al.) discloses a high performance overbased calcium sulphonate, grease comprising up to about 28 wt % of overbased calcium sulphonate, colloidally dispersed in the calcium carbonate essentially in the form of calcite, a calcium soap of a fatty acid containing about 12 to about 24 carbon 5 atoms and an oleaginous material. The grease has a worked cone penetration rating of less than about 295. The grease contains a polymer with poor water resistance properties.<br>
US Patent Number 5,338,467 (Olson et al.) discloses a process for preparing a non-Newtonian oil composition in the form of a grease comprising an overbased<br>
10 calcium sulphonate, colloidally dispersed in calcium carbonate in the form of calcite. The grease is prepared by heating the overbased calcium sulphonate amorphous calcium carbonate and a converting agent containing about 12 to about 24 carbon atoms in an oleaginous material. Neither the process nor the final grease contains a polymer capable of imparting water resistance properties.<br>
15	US Patent Number 4,597,880 (Eliades et al.) discloses a one-step process for<br>
preparing a calcium sulphonate grease or complex grease by admixing a volatile carrier, calcium sulphonate as a dispersing agent and calcium carbonate in the form of calcite. Neither the process nor the final grease contains a polymer capable of imparting water resistance properties.<br>
20	US Patent Number 6,300,288 (Scharf et al.) discloses a polyolefm having<br>
grafted carboxylic acid functionality capable of imparting water resistance properties into grease. The grease may contain a gelled overbased material containing a number of acidic organic compounds with functional groups including sulphonic acid hydrocarbyl succinic acid or ester thereof, or a carboxylic acid or derivatives<br>
25 thereof. The carboxylic acid includes polyisobutylene succinic acid or polypropene succinic acid.<br>
It would be desirable to have a grease capable of imparting decreased water wash-off. The present invention provides a grease that is capable of imparting decreased water wash-off.<br>
30	It would be desirable to have a grease that are capable of imparting improved<br>
thickening. The present invention provides a grease that is capable of imparting improved thickening.<br><br>

(i) a calcium containing overbased organic acid; and<br>
20	(ii) at least one acid producing compound or derivatives thereof<br>
selected from the group consisting of:<br>

5	Overbased materials are known materials. Overbasing also referred to as<br>
superbasing or hyperbasing, is a means for supplying a large quantity of basic material in a form which is soluble or dispersible in oil. Overbased products are known and used in lubricant technology to provide detergent additives.<br>
Overbased materials  are  generally  single  phase,  homogeneous  systems<br>
10 characterised by a metal content in excess of that which would be present according to the stoichiometry of the metal and the particular acidic organic compound reacted with the metal. The amount of excess metal is commonly expressed in terms of metal ratio. The term "metal ratio" is the ratio of the total equivalents of the metal to the equivalents of the acidic organic compound. A neutral metal salt has a metal<br>
15 ratio of one. A salt having 4.5 times as much metal as present in a normal salt will have metal excess of 3.5 equivalents, or a ratio of 4.5. The basic salts may have a metal ratio of 1.5 to 30, preferably 3 to 25, and more preferably 7 to 20.<br>

Specific Embodiment Examples<br>
Preparative Example 1: Preparation of Copolymer of CIS Olefm and Maleic Anhydride<br>
5	A 4-necked flask containing a stirrer, thermometer, an addition funnel and a<br>
nitrogen sparge tube is charged with about 1008g of octadecene, about 52g of maleic anhydride and about lOOOg of xylene. The addition funnel is charged with about lOg of di-tert-butyl peroxide in about 50g of xylene. The flask is heated to about 60°C and nitrogen is bubbled through the reactants using the sparge tube while<br>
10 heating to about 100°C. An additional funnel containing about 47 Ig of melted maleic anhydride in about lOOg of xylene is added to the flask. The reaction mixture is then heated to about 135°C where the di-tert-butyl peroxide is then added dropwise. To the reaction mixture melted maleic anhydride is added dropwise over a period of about 3 hours. The reaction mixture is stirred for about another 30<br>
15     minutes to complete the polymerisation before heating the product to 190°C to<br>
remove xylene. The product has a MW of about 4756 and a Mn of about 1630.<br>

10 melted azelaic acid in about lOOg of isopropyl alcohol is added to the flask over about 20 minutes. The flask is heated to about 57°C where about 80g of water and lOOg of isopropyl alcohol are separately added cooling the flask temperature to about 43°C. The flask is heated to about 52°C and the mixture becomes viscous. To the flask about 390g of 800 SUS (corresponds to 176.2 mms2/s) oil is added. The<br>
15 temperature is then increased to about 66°C before another 146g addition of 800 SUS (corresponds to 176.2 mms2/s) oil. The temperature is further increased to 74°C before another 208g addition of 800 SUS (corresponds to 176.2 mms2/s) oil. After the addition of oil the temperature is increased 85°C where another 130g of 800 SUS (corresponds to 176.2 mms2/s) oil is added. The contents of the flask are<br>
20     transferred to a Hobart kettle and mixed at about 130°C to remove residual water. The product obtained as has a Po=293 tenths of millimeters. Example 7<br>
Example 7 is prepared using the same apparatus as Example 1. The flask is charged with about 628g of 300 TBN overbased calcium sulphonate and about 615g<br>
25 of 800SUS oil and heated to about 48°C. The flask is then charged with a solution of about 34g of citric acid in about 25g HaO. The flask is then heated to about 52°C where about 20g of water and about 60g of methyl alcohol are separately added. The flask is then heated to about 60°C before the addition of about 60 g of Ir^O and lOOg of isopropyl alcohol. The reaction is mixed for about 5 minutes and about 170g<br>
30 of 800 SUS (corresponds to 176.2 mms2/s) oil are added. The flask is heated to about 130°C to remove solvent. The product is cooled. The product obtained as has a Po=316°C tenths of millimeters.<br>

Reference Example 1 (Rl)<br>
The calcium sulphonate grease is prepared using the process described in Example 1, except the dodecyl succinic acid is not added.  The calcium sulphonate is present at about 38 wt % of the grease composition. An ASTM D217 penetration test run established that Reference Example 1 has a Po=296 tenths of millimeters. Test 1<br>
The ASTM D4049 test measures the resistance of grease to water spray. A pre-weighed stainless steel panel is evenly coated with about 8mm of grease. The panel is then reweighed. The coated stainless steel panel is then placed in a water spray for about 5 minutes. The water is preheated to about 38°C and held at constant temperature. The water pressure pump is held at about 276 kPa (equivalent to about 40 psi). The panel is removed from the spray and heated in an oven for about 1 hour at about 66°C. The panel is then removed from the oven, allowed to cool and is reweighed. The results obtained for the grease compositions are shown in Table 2 below.<br>
Table 1: ASTM D4049 Results<br><br><br>
Example 	% Grease Removed by 	Water Spray <br>
1 	22.9 <br>
2 	14.8 <br>
Rl 	40 <br>
The results indicate calcium sulphonate grease from Example 1 and Example 2 has better resistance to water spray than the reference example not containing the alkyl succinic acid of the invention.   Grease with better resistance to water spray 20     have increased longevity and/or decreased wear.<br>
