				<td>FIELD<br>
The present invention is related to integrated microelectromechanical devices and more particularly, to semiconductor roicroelectromechanical devices with an integrated conductive shield, and a method for manufacturing the same.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Microelectromechanical devices are useful in many applications. These devices range from automobile sensors to actuators used on space exploration vehicles. Generally, these sensors and actuators provide information about environmental conditions, and/or react to changes in the environmental conditions. For instance, a microelectromechanical-pressure-sensor device may be used to measure an automobile's engine manifold pressure (or vacuum). In operation, the microelectromechanical-pressure-sensox device provides an electrical output that is proportional to the manifold pressure (or vacuum). This electrical output may be used by an engine management system for controlling fuel delivery to the automobile's engine.<br>
hi another useful application, one or more microelectromechanical-accelerometer<br>
devices may be employed for measuring the acceleration or, conversely, the deceleration of a vehicle. In crash situations, these devices may enable a crash detection system to determine whether to deploy an atrbag.<br>
Additionally, microelectromechanical devices are pervasively deployed in many types of industrial equipment.   From simple single-fixture assembly machines to high-<br>
volume complex machinery, these inicroelectromechanical devices supply feedback for process and quality control.<br>
Microelectromechanical devices may be incorporated as components in many medical equipment devices, such as respiration devices, dialysis machines, and infusion pumps. In surgjcal procedures, physicians are aided by data from various pieces of surgical equipment that employ nucroeiectromechanical devices. These devices generally furnish information about the surrounding area in which the surgeon is operating. For example, the gage or absolute pressure of the area in which a catheter is positioned may be provided by an electrical output of a microelectromechanical-sensor device installed on the tip of the catheter. During an operation or other medical procedure, this electrical output may provide valuable feedback to the surgeon.<br>
These cited examples indicate the breadth of microelectromechanical devices used in various applications in today's automated world, however many other microelectromechanical devices exist Moreover, the types of devices, and their related applications continue to proliferate. Due to the widespread adoption and the ever-decreasing size of microelectromechanical devices, maintaining or improving the quality and performance of these devices may require implementing device and process control improvements so that the devices perform accurately, reliably, reproducibry, and repeatedly.<br>
Environmental conditions acting on or impressed upon environmentally susceptible microelectromechanical devices may cause unwanted effects that may prevent the devices from arouning acceptable performance levels. These environmental conditions, which often contain energy in one form or another, may cause undesired effects, such as drift or instability, in the device's electrical output. To reduce or eliminate the drift or instability, a<br>
system and method feat minimizes ot eliminates the undesirable exchange of energy would be desirable.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
According to one embodiment, a semiconductor micxoelectromechanical device, . such as a pressure sensor or accelerometer, may include a substrate over which a sensing element is formed. A conductive shield may be fabricated over at least a portion of the sensing element. Further, the conductive shield may be coupled with a substrate. By this coupling, the conductive shield and substrate may form an encapsulation of at least a portion of the sensing element- Moreover, coupling the conductive shield with the substrate may allow placing bom the conductive shield and substrate at substantially the same voltage.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION <br>
The embodiments of the microelectromechanical device described herein are described in relation to a preferred microelectromechanical pressure sensor and its architectural components. The described architecture and processes for fabricating the microelectromechanical pressure sensor are likewise applicable to other microelectromechanical devices.<br>
FIG. 1 is a conceptual drawing illustrating an embodiment of a cross-section of the substructure of a rmcroeiecm?raecharjical device 100 at a first processing phase. While FIG. 1 and other subsequent figures illustrate the microelectromechanical device's substructure at certain processing phases, raese phases are for illustration purposes only and not necessarily intended to limit the scope of the present embodiments, provide sequential processing steps, or provide an inflexible fabrication recipe.<br>
Referring to FIG. 1, the microelectromechanical device 100 includes a substrate 102, a layer-of-substrate silicon 102a, a buried-oxide layer 104, and a top-epitaxial layer 106 deposited atop the layer-of-substraie silicon 102a.<br>
The substrate 102 may include non-semiconductor substrate material, such as sapphire or ceramic, and/or may include semiconductor substrate material, such as an N-type or a P-type silicon wafer. Preferably, the substrate 102 is a bulk silicon substrate. Silicon enables the use of many common silicon semiconductor-processing techniques, such as masks, implants, etchings, dopings, and others. In the preferred microelectromechanical pressure sensor, the substrate 102 devices maybe fabricated from a heavily P-type doped silicon wafer.<br>
The substrate 102 may exist in the final microelectromechanical device or may be removed during processing. For instance, in fabricating the preferred microelectromechanical pressure sensor, the "backside" of the substrate 102 may be etched away to form a silicon diaphragm for sensing pressure. Accordingly, the substrate 102 may contain one or more openings for miming and for providing access to the diaphragm. In other embodiments, the substrate 102 may contain openings for suspending moveable elements of the microelectromechanical device. To create these openings, portions of the substrate 102 may be etched using chemical etching processes.<br>
Implanted in me substrate 102 is the buried-oxide layer 104. Preferably, this buried-oxide layer 104 is created in the substrate 102 using a Separation by IMplantation of OXygen (SIMOX) process. Alternatively, the buried-oxide layer 104 may be formed using a Bonded Silicon On Insulator (BSOD, Bonded and Etchback Silicon On Insulator (BESOT), or other similar process. Other processes for creating the buried-oxide layer 104 are possible as well. During the SIMOX process, oxygen ions are implanted into one or more surfaces of a bulk-silicon substrate using an ion-implantation process. Preferably, the oxygen ions are implanted through only one surface, such as substrate surface 103. By controlling the ion-implanting process, the oxygen atoms that are implanted into the<br>
substrate 102 via the substrate surface 103 create the buried-oxide layer 104 at a predetermined depth below the surface of the substrate.<br>
Creating the buhed-oxide layer 104 beneath the substrate surface 103 results in a layer-of-substrate silicon 102a resting above buried-oxide layer 104. This layer-of-substrate silicon 102a comprises a layer of bulk substrate that is isolated from the remaining bulk substrate by the buried-oxide layer 104. In a preferred embodiment, the layer-of-substrate silicon 102a and the substrate 102 "sandwich" the buried-oxide layer 104. This layer-of-substrate silicon 102a provides a base upon which other layers of the rnicroelectromechanical device elements may be formed.<br>
The SIMOX process may also include a high-temperature anneal process during and after creating the buried-oxide layer 104 to facilitate enhanced control over the ion-implant process, and to minimize defects in the substrate surface. After the high-temperature anneal, the unit cells of the substrate are preferably arranged in a single-crystal silicon structure. This single crystalline structure provides a surface upon which a single-crystal epitaxial silicon layer may be deposited.<br>
Using standard epitaxial techniques and processes, the top-epitaxial layer 106 may be deposited over the substrate 102. In an exemplary configuration, the top-epitaxial layer 106 is deposited over the layer-of-substrate silicon 1 Ola. The standard epitaxial techniques and processes for depositing the epitaxial layer 106 include chemical vapor deposition (CVD), atmospheric pressure chemical vapor deposition (APCVD), low-pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD), plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD), and other deposition techniques.<br>
Further, dopant materials may be introduced during the deposition process, which may cause the top-epitaxial layer 106 to become electrically conductive. Alternatively, the top-epitaxial layer 106 maybe doped subsequent to deposition.<br>
The combined thickness of the top-epitaxial layer 106 and the layer-of-substrate silicon 102a may provide useable silicon for creating one or more elements of microelectromechanical devices. The thickness of the top-epitaxial layer 106 added to the layer-of-substrate silicon 102a may vary depending on the type of circuit or microelectromechanical device. For instance, the combined thickness of the top-epitaxial layer 106 and fee layer-of-substrate silicon 102a varies from CMOS circuitry, in which the overall thickness of the CMOS circuitry typically ranges from about 500 A to 2000 A, to bipolar circuitry, in which the overall thickness of the bipolar circuitry may range from 0.3 jim to 10 urn. As overall thicknesses of other devices vary, the combined thickness of the top-epitaxial layer 106 and the layer-of-substrate silicon 102a may likewise vary.<br>
FIG. 2 is a conceptual drawing illustrating an embodiment of a cross-section of the substructure of a microelectromechanical device 200 at a second processing phase. As illustrated in FIG. 2, the microelcdromecnanical device 200 includes a substrate 202, a layer-of-substrate silicon 202a, a buried-oxide layer 204, a top-epitaxial layer 206, and a thermal-oxide layer 210 formed or "grown" over applicable areas of the top-epitaxial layer 206.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the substrate 202 comprises a heavily doped P-type silicon substrate, and the buried-oxide layer 204 comprises a buried silicon dioxide (S1Q2) layer. The top-epitaxial layer 206 may be an N-type top-epitaxial layer. Preferably, the thermal-oxide layer 210 is formed as an SiOj layer mat is "grown" atop the N-type top-epitaxial layer.<br>
The microelectromecrianical device 200 may also include openings 230a and 230b that are patterned and etched from the thermal-oxide layer 210. Openings 230a and 230b are created for selectively doping the underlying layers, such as the top-epitaxial layer 204 and the layer-of-substrate silicon 202a, exposed by the openings 230a and 230b. These underlying layers may be doped using ion-implantation and/or diffusion. Although FIG. 2 shows only two openings in the roennal-oxide layer 210, namely openings 230a and 230b, the substructure of the microelectromechanical device 200 may include additional openings in the thermal-oxide layer 210. Alternatively, the substructure of the microelectromechanical device 200 may include only one opening in the thermal-oxide layer 210.<br>
Further included in the substructure of the microelectromechanical device 200 are a number of first-doped regions, illustrated as first-doped regions 234a and 234b. First-doped regions 234a and 234b may be created by either diffusing or ion implanting the appropriate dopant material into layers of the microelectromechanical device exposed by openings 230a and 230b, respectively. In a preferred embodiment, the first-doped regions 234a and 234b may be created by diffusing or by ion-implanting a P-type dopant into an N-type top-epitaxial layer through openings in a S1O2 thermal-oxide layer. The microelectromechanical device 200 may also include an implant oxide layer grown over the areas exposed by the openings 230a and 230b. This implant oxide is used for protecting the areas exposed by openings 230a and 230b during the doping process.<br>
Although FIG. 2 illustrates only two first-doped regions, namely first-doped regions 234a and 234b, the substructure of the microelectromechanical device 200 may include more than two first-doped regions. Alternatively, the substructure of the nucroelectromechanical device 200 may include only one first-doped region.    The<br>
rmcroelectroraechanical device may also include other beneficial and sacrificial layers typically used in integrated circuit processing.<br>
FIG. 3 is a conceptual drawing illustrating an embodiment of a cross-section of the substructure of a microelectromechanical device 300 at a third processing phase. FIG. 3 shows an exemplary microetectromechanical device 30,0, which is similar to the, microelectromechanical device 200 in most respects, except as described herein. As illustrated in FIG. 3, the microelectromechamcal device 300 includes a substrate 302, a layer-of-substrate silicon 302a, a buried-oxide layer 304, a top-epitaxial layer 306, a thermal-oxide layer 310, at least one second opening 312, first-doped regions 334a and 334b, at least one second doped region 33S, bond-pad locations 350a and 350b, and a sensing element 360.<br>
The thermal-oxide layer 310 of the microelectromechanical device 300 is patterned and etched or otherwise removed to create at least one second opening 312. Except for locations reserved for runners, connection paths and/or bond pads, such as bond pad locations 350a and 350b, the second opening 312 exposes all areas of the top-epitaxial layer 306. Given mat the thermal-oxide layer 310 generally provides a barrier that shields underlying layers from being altered during processing, by creating the second opening 312 any of the several of toe underlying layers may be altered with additional processing.<br>
As such, at least one second-doped region 338 may be created by blanket doping the exposed top-epitaxial layer 306. If, for example, the top-epitaxial layer 306 is N-type, then preferably, the second-doped region 338 is P-type. This P-type region may be created by blanket doping the N-type top-epitaxial layer using P-type dopants. Blanket doping also increases the concentration of dopant atoms in the previously doped areas of the top-epitaxial layer 306. Thus, blanket doping an N-type top-epitaxial layer with a sufficient<br>
quantity of P-type dopant causes a previously un-doped or counter-doped area of the N-type top-epitaxial layer to become a P-type doped region- Also, blanket doping the previously P-type doped regions, such as first-doped regions 334a and 334b, with a sufficient quantity of P-type dopant causes an increase in dopant concentration. To protect the underlying top-epitaxial layer from damage during the blanket doping process, the niicroelectromechanical device 300 may optionally include an implant oxide grown over the exposed areas of top-epitaxial layer 306.<br>
As noted above, the microelectromcchanical device 300 also includes sensing element 360. Preferably, the sensing element 360 is composed of the first-doped regions 334a and 334b, and the second-doped region 338. The sensing element 360 may provide the sensing component of the preferred microelectromechanical pressure sensor sa well as of other microelectromechanical devices, such as accelerometers, magnetoresistive sensors or gyroscopes. In these devices, it may comprise conductive elements, capacitive elements, or other sensing components. The sensing element 360 may also comprise diodes and transistors. Other configurations are possible as well.<br>
During one of the various phases of processing, certain features or components of the microelectromechanical device 300 may be fabricated for use in subsequent fabrication phases. Depending on the configuration and type of microelectromechanical device being fabricated, during the fabrication of the device, material from one or more layers may be removed to provide for access to underlying layers. Access to an underlying layer in one phase of the processing may be available for subsequent processing in later phases. Accordingly, the nncro«lecfawnechanical device 300 includes at least one via 348, which provides access to the substrate 302.<br>
The via 348 is created.by patterning and etching or otherwise removing a predetermined volume of material from layers of the microelectromechanical device 300. Included in the material removed from the layers are portions of the top-epitaxial layer 306, the buried-oxide layer 304, the layer-of-substrate silicon 302a, and/or any other beneficial or sacrificial layer below the thermal-oxide layer 310.<br>
Like the via 348, during the processing of the rmraoelectromechamcal device 300, other features or components, such as circuit-contact region 354, may be fabricated in one phase for later processing. Preferably, circuit-contact region 354 is fabricated over the area of the substrate 302 exposed by via 348. The circuit-contact region 354 may be fabricated by doping the exposed area of the substrate 302. Alternatively, the circuit-contact region 354 may be fabricated by doping the exposed area of the substrate 302, and then reacting the doped area with platinum. Preferably, in a heavily P-type doped silicon substrate, such as substrate 302, the circuit-contact region 354 comprises an N+ circuit-contact region.<br>
FIG- 4 is a conceptual drawing illustrating an embodiment of a cross-section of the substructure of a rmcroelectromeehanical device 400 at a fourth processing phase. As illustrated in FIG. 4, the microelectromechanical device 400 includes a substrate 402, a layer-of-substrate silicon 402a, a buried-oxide layer 404, a top-epitaxial layer 406, a thermal-oxide layer 410, at least one second opening 412, first-doped regions 434a and 434b, at least one second-doped region 438, bond pad locations 450a and 450b, and a sensing element 460. hi addition, the microelectromechanical device 400 may include an insulating layer 414 and a conductive-shield layer 4l6 formed over the substrate 402.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment, the insulating layer 414 is deposited directly over the sensing element 460- Preferably, the insulating layer 414 may be fabricated from silicon dioxide (S1Q2) using one of the various types of CVD deposition noted above. However,<br>
die insulating layer 414 may be fabricated using other processes that employ other oxides or insulators. In addition to providing a chemical barrier, the insulating layer 414 may Amotion as an electrical insulator that separates the sensing element 460 from other components. Further, the insulating layer 414 may provide a mechanical barrier to protect the sensing element 460 from mechanical damage during processing.<br>
The microelectromechanical device includes a conductive-shield layer 416 formed over the sensing element 460. hi a multi-level, layered embodiment, the conductive-shield layer 416, as deposited, may follow the form of the underlying layers including the sensing element 460. Preferably, the conductive-shield layer 416 is formed from a doped polysilicon layer. As described in more detail below, the conductive-shield layer 416 may be alternatively comprised of a layer of metal or metallic materials.<br>
The conductive-shield layer 416 formed from doped polysilicon may be deposited over some or all of the substrate 402 using one or more of the various CVD processes noted above. Further, the doping of the doped-polysilicon layer may occur using Phosphorus Oxvchloride (POCfc) depositon and drive in operations. Alternatively, the doping may occur simultaneously with the deposition. Alternatively, the doping may occur after deposition of the polysilicon using an ion implantation process.<br>
Maintaining the modulus of elasticity (Young's Modulus) of the conductive-shield layer 416 at about the same Young's modulus when doping the layer of polysilicon may prevent a number of undesired effects in the output of the microelectromechanical device 400. Included among these undesirable effects are mechanical and thermal hystereses. Accordingly, the mechanical elasticity of the conductive-shield layer 416 preferably reflects the modulus of elasticity (Young's Modulus) of the layers underlying the conductive-shield layer 416, including the sensing element 460.    To provide such<br>
mechanical elasticity, the conductive-shield layer 416 is preferably formed Scorn a layer of polysilicon doped with a 1E+15 atoms/cm2 Boron dose. The conductive-shield layer 416 may be formed from polysilicon mat is doped using other dopants and dosages as well.<br>
As noted above, the microelectromechanical device 400 may include a conductive-shield layer 416 comprised of metal or metallic materials, such as Tungsten (W), Chromium (Cr) or Beryllium (Be). In such case, the metal or metallic materials composing the conductive-shield layer 416 may be selected so that metal or metallic materials exhibit a Young's Modulus substantially similar to that of the modulus of elasticity (Young's Modulus) of the layers underlying the conductive-shield layer 416. Further, hysteresis in the output of the microelectromechanical device 400 may be prevented if the metal or metallic material that composes the conductive-shield layer 416 is maintained within its elastic deformation region.<br>
FIG. 5 is a conceptual drawing illustrating an embodiment of a cross-section of the substructure of a microelectromechanical device 500 at a fifth processing phase. FIG. 5 shows an exemplary microelectromechanical device 500 with integrated conductive shield, which is similar to the microelectromechanical device 400 in most respects, except as described herein.<br>
Referring to FIG. 5, the microelectromechanical device 500 includes a substrate 502, a layer-of-substrate silicon 502a, a buried-oxide layer 504, a top-epitaxial layer 506, a thennal-oxide layer 510, at least one second opening 512, an insulating layer 514, a conductive-shield layer 516, first-doped regions 534a and 534b, at least one second-doped region 538, bond pad locations 550a and 550b, and a sensing element 560. hi addition, the microelectromechanical device 500 includes vias 548, 552a and 552b and circuit-contact regions 554, 556a and 556b. The microelectromechamcal device 500 may also include a<br>
passivation layer 518, and a first-metal layer 562 deposited over at least one part of the passivation layer 518. The microelectromechanical device 500 may include several other metal layers (not shown), such as barrier and top-level metalization layers.<br>
The passivation layer 518 may be fabricated from S1Q2 deposited or grown over at least a portion of the layers deposited over the substrate 502. Preferably, the passivation layer 518 is deposited over the side of substrate 502 containing the layers of material for creating the microelectromechanical device 500. While the passivation layer 518 may be deposited on the entire side of substrate 502, preferably, predetermined areas of the layers may be masked-off for subsequent processing.<br>
The passivation layer 518 may provide an electro-mechanical barrier against external environments that are impressed upon the microelectromechanical device 500. In one exemplary embodiment, the passivation layer 518 may comprise a silicon nitride layer (Si3N4). In addition to providing an electro-mechanical barrier against external environments, the S13N4 layer may also provide scratch and moisture protection. The passivation layer 518 fabricated from un-doped Si3N4 may provide a sodium barrier, a strong dielectric, and an oxidation barrier for the elements of the microelectromechanical devices protected by the layer. The passivation layer 518 may be fabricated using other materials, as well.<br>
Vias 548, 550a and 550b provide access to underlying layers of the microelectromechanical device 500. Preferably, vias 552a and 552b provide access to the thermal-oxide layer 510. Vias 552a and 552b may also furnish access to several of the underlying layers for fabricating other elements, such as bond pads and runner paths. Thus, vias 552a and 552b may correspond to the bond pad locations 550a and 550b, respectively. Although only three vias, namely vias 548,550a and 550b, for accessing underlying layers<br>
of   the   microelectromechanical   device   500   are   illustrated   in   FIG.   5,   the microelectromechanical device 500 may include more or less than three vias.<br>
Included in the microelectromechanical device 500 is a plurality of substrate circuit-contact regions, such as circuit-contact regions 554, 556a, and 555b. The circuit-contact regions 554, 556a and 556b may include platinum saticide (PtSi) contacts formed over the areas of the substrate 502 that correspond to the areas exposed by vias 548,550a and 550b, respectively. The substrate circuit-contact regions may include contacts formed from other metals or conductive materials as well.<br>
in one embodiment, circuit-contact region 554 may provide a location for coupling the conductive-shield layer 516 to the substrate 502. The conductive-shield layer 516 may couple or otherwise connect to the substrate 502 at the circuit-contact region 554 through via 548. By coupling the conductive-shield layer 516 to the substrate 502, the conductive shield and the substrate may be placed at substantially the same voltage. This voltage may be at a constant voltage, or alternatively, at varying potentials. Further, the voltage may be at a voltage less man or greater than ground potential, or at ground potential of sensing element.<br>
Alternatively, if the microelectromechanical device 500 is a stand-alone microelectromechanical device having a external node for coupling or otherwise connecting the conductive-shield layer, then the conductive-shield layer 516 may be coupled or otherwise connected with this node. Once coupled or otherwise connected to the external node, the conductive-shield layer 516 may be placed at the voltage of the external node. As another alternative, if the microelectromechanical device 500 is part of another system having a node for coupling or otherwise connecting the conductive-shield layer, the conductive-shield layer 516 may likewise be coupled or otherwise connected with the node<br>
of such system. Once coupled or otherwise connected to the node, the conductive-shield layer 516 may be placed at the voltage of the system.<br>
An exemplary arrangement for coupling the conductive-shield layer 516 with the substrate 502 at one of the circuit-contact regions may be provided by simply depositing an N-type-doped-polysihcon-conductive-shield layer over an N-type-circuit-contact region in a P-type substrate. In another exemplary arrangement, the coupling of the conductive-shield layer 516 with the substrate 502 at the substrate circuit-contact region 554 may be provided by the contact created between an N-type doped polysilicon conductive-shield layer deposited over aPtSi contact formed over an N-type circuit-contact region in a P-type substrate.<br>
In an alternative arrangement, coupling the conductive-shield layer 516 with the substrate 502 may be provided by physical contact between a polysilicon film or metal film deposited directly over the N-type substrate circuit-contact region. In yet another arrangement, the conductive-shield layer 516 may couple with the substrate 502 through via 548. This coupling may be provided by a contact formed from depositing a metal or metallic conductive-shield layer and reacting the metal or metallic conductive-shield layer with an N-type substrate circuit-contact region. Other coupling constructions are possible as well.<br>
Further, depending on how much the conductive-shield layer 516 covers the sensing element 560, coupling the conductive-shield layer 516 with the substrate 502 at circuit-contact region 554 may provide for partial or complete encapsulation of the sensing element 560. In the case where the conductive-shield layer 516 provides complete encapsulation of the sensing element 560, the conductive-shield layer 516 may provide protection  of the sensing element  560 from undesired ion interference.     Partial<br>
encapsulation of the sensing element 560 may also provide protection against undesired ion interference, notwithstanding the less than complete encapsulation.<br>
In the presence of one or more forms of energy, e.g., thermal energy, ions captured within the microelectromechanical device's composition may migrate towards the sensing element 560. In addition, ions from energy rich environments may migrate from the energy rich environments towards the sensing element 560. Alternatively, ions from energy rich environments may cause an exchange of energy in the atoms of the rnicroelectromechanical device thereby creating ions within the microelectromechanical device's composition, which may migrate towards the sensing element 560.<br>
For example, ions from an energy rich environment, such as ions derived from silicon oil, that are impressed upon the outer surface of the passivation layer 518 may migrate, at varying rates, through passivation layer 518. Once passing through the passivation layer, these ions may further migrate through voids in the rnicroelectromechanical device's structure. Additionally, the ions from external sources may ionize atoms in the structure of the passivation layer 518, which in turn migrate to the sensing element 560 by exchanging charges amongst the atoms of the passivation and underlying layers.<br>
As another example, bathing the microelectromechanical device 500, which contains a passivation layer 518 fabricated from Si3N4, in a silicon oil bath containing free ions and subjecting the device to a sufficient energy source may cause random atoms of the Si^ passivation layer 518 to become ionized. With sufficient energy, these charged atoms may migrate towards the sensing element 560 that, in turn, may cause the output of the microelectromechanical device 500 to drift because of the changing electron or hole conduction.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment of the micxoelectromechanical device 500 in which the conductive-shield layer 516 covers at least one portion of the sensing element 560, and the conductive-shield layer 516 is coupled to a voltage source, undesired ions that migrate from external sources towards the sensing element may be attracted to the conductive-shield layer 516. Similarly, the conductive-shield layer 516 may attract the undesired and internally derived ions or charged atoms. To facilitate ion attraction, the conductive-shield layer 516 is preferably coupled to the substrate 502. Then, the combination is placed at the same voltage, preferably ground potential. Placing the combination at the same voltage may cause the charged atoms to migrate towards the conductive shield, rather than the sensing element 560.<br>

Using LPCVD, the first layer of polysilicon may be deposited to achieve a thickness of about 1500 A. To facilitate depositing the polysilicon layer, one or more parameters of LPCVD process, such as temperature, may be controlled. Preferably, the temperature during deposition is controlled to about 610 degrees Celsius. Like other parameters of die LPCVD process, the temperature, however, may be varied.<br>
Additionally, the second layer of polysilicon, which may comprise mechanical quality or low stress polysilicon, may be deposited by an LPCVD process to achieve a thickness of about 1500 A. During deposition, the temperature is controlled to at approximately 598 degrees Celsius. As with depositing the first layer of polysilicon, the temperature of the LPCVD process when depositing the second layer of polysilicon may be varied.<br>
During deposition, the conductive shield may require doping the polysilicon, which may be provided in-situ by introducing the proper concentration of N or P type atoms. Alternatively, forming the conductive shield over the sensing element, shown at block 604, may include post-deposition doping by way of ion implantation. In the preferred microelectromechanical-pressure-sensor device, the post-deposition ion implantation may include implanting a phosphorous dopant dose of about 1E+15 atoms/cm2 at about 50KeV into the deposited polysilicon. m another exemplary alternative, the doping of the polysilicon may be performed using POCI3 deposition and drive in operations.<br>

Further, by forming the insulating layer between the<br>
conductive shield and sensing element, the insulating layer may protect the sensing element and other layers from mechanical damage.<br>
