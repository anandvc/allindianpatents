The invention relates to a method for manufacturing individual confectionery bars.  The invention relates in particular to bars comprising a solid confectionery core in three dimensions and an at least partial coating of boiled sugar.<br>
Bars based on boiled sugar comprising a core of the waffle, biscuit or ice cream type, for example, are confectionery products which are increasingly successful. The boiled sugar gives the product masticability which is highly appreciated because it blends well in the mouth with the rest of the product. A core coated on several sides with boiled sugar provides better homogeneity in the mouth than a structure in superposed layers such as a simple laminate of the caramel/ waffle type, for example.<br>
It is therefore sought to manufacture bars which are composite products generally formed of a solid core in three dimensions coated, at least partially in its three dimensions, with a boiled sugar layer which is itself preferably coated with an external chocolate layer.<br>
The traditional method for manufacturing such confectionery bars consists in<br>
continuously conveying separate portions of the core to be coated under a curtain of<br>
liquid boiled sugar so as to coat the core on several of its sides. The temperature<br>
necessary to reach a sufficient degree of fluidity is of the order of 60°C and more,<br>
for a boiled sugar of the caramel type, for example. A major disadvantage of<br>
coating under a curtain results from the difficulty in controlling the thickness of the<br>
coating of the vertical sides of the core, hi particular, because of its high fluidity at<br>
the time of the passage of the core, the boiled sugar does not harden immediately<br>
and therefore tends to run down the vertical sides of the core, thus forming an<br>
undesirable gradient of coating thickness. The resuh of this is problems of quality<br>
and reproducibility of the product. Another	<br><br>
disadvantage is linked to the large mass of liquid which is necessary in order to carry out proper coating with a relatively large proportion to be recovered. It is thus necessary to provide for a system for recovering and reprocessing the mass of sugar taking into account the problem that this mass tends to harden rapidly on contact with the components of the recovery plant. In some cases, it is necessary to provide for a tunnel cooling system in order to accelerate the cooling of the coating, reduce the gradient effect and thus limit the "loss" of coating material.<br>
Patent US 4,518,617 relates to the manufacture of blocks of wafers formed of superposed layers of wafers coated with intermediate layers of cream between two layers of wafers. Such a process therefore relates to the production of products having a "sandwich" configuration based on successively deposited layers of cream and therefore has no relationship with the covering of a confectionery base with a layer of boiled sugar on several of its sides.<br>
European Patent Application 0,304,570 relates to a process for manufacturing a confectionery mass on a roller, sprinkling solid components on the mass before it cools and depositing the said mass on a conveyor belt.<br>
Patent US 4,454,834 relates to a method of coating wafer sheets or the like by spreading a solidifying confectionery mass over the wafer sheets so as to form products with a "sandwich" structure.<br>
The present invention does not aim to form "sandwich" structures but products coated on several sides usually obtained by the technique of conveying a confectionery base under a liquid curtain of boiled sugar.<br>
A need therefore exists for a method for manufacturing confectionery bars which overcomes the abovementioned disadvantages and in particular eliminates the problem linked to the formation of a<br><br>
gradient of thickness during the coating of a product in three dimensions by traditional processes.<br>
The present invention therefore relates to the manufacture of individual confectionery bars comprising a core in three dimensions and a layer of confectionery material based on boiled sugar at least partially coating the core. The method comprises an operation during which at least one continuous band of confectionery material based on boiled sugar is dimensioned in the hot state on a cooling roller. Then after sufficient cooling on the said roller, the band is detached from the roller. The band is then deposited on a core base continuously passing on a conveying means. The depositing is performed by bringing the band into contact substantially on a depositing plane adjacent to the most elevated surface or line of contact of the base. According to an important aspect of the invention, the band is brought, at the time of depositing, into a viscoplastic state which allows it to bend under its own weight so as to at least partially cover the sides of the said base situated under the said surface/line of contact. The product is then cut into portions of desired length.<br>
Such a method has the advantage of allowing coating or covering of a core base by means of a confectionery material without encountering the disadvantages linked to the traditional processes for coating under a curtain. In particular, the depositing is carried out with a reduced or even no, gradient of thickness of coating on the sides of the core and causes a minimum of loss of material. The result is a better control of the dimensional tolerances of the product. Not only is the quality and reproducibility of the product ensured, but it is also easier to envisage modifications in the design, structure and characteristics of the product according to needs, such as for example in order to adapt the product to different tastes or different markets.<br><br>
Preferably, the deformation of the band occurs by bending the free portions over the base of the core and without significant modifications of the initial dimensions of the band as defined during the application of the band to the said roller. The expression "free portions" should be understood to mean the portions of the band which are not in contact with the surface or with the line of contact of the base at the time of depositing on the base. It is thus surprising to observe that it is possible to carry out the depositing of the band for the at least partial coating of the core using the viscoplastic deformation properties of the confectionery material; by allowing it to bend simply under its own weight without however affecting the thickness or the width of the band initially provided. An insignificant dimensional modification is understood to mean an extension of less than 5% relative to the initial dimensions as defined at the time of dimensioning of the band.<br>
According to a preferred aspect of the invention, the application of the band of confectionery material is carried out by applying the material in the hot state over the roller. The initial temperature reached by the confectionery material is the effective temperature for allowing dimensioning of the band in thickness and in width through an opening having the dimensions corresponding to the dimensions of the band to be deposited.<br>
The dimensioning of the band is an important stage during which the band is formed to the dimensions which correspond to the development of the confectionery layer once in a folded or coated configuration on the core base.<br>
In order to control the physical characteristics of the band, in particular its viscoplastic state at the time of deposition on the core base, it is necessary to cool the band in order to solidify it sufficiently until it is detached from the roller. For this purpose, the roller is used to cool<br><br>
the band of boiled sugar material from the application of the band to the roller until it is detached. According to one characteristic of the invention, the band is subjected to a decrease in temperature on the cooling roller of between 50 and 60°C, preferably between 52 and 57°C. This decrease in temperature corresponds to the difference between the initial temperature of the band of boiled sugar during dimensioning and the final temperature or the temperature for deposition of the band over the base. It is important to note that the band is not subjected to any mechanical stress during its controlled decrease in temperature on the roller; this makes it possible to preserve intact the emulsive structure of the sugar/fat network. Good characteristics of the material are thus preserved with the advantage, in particular, of delaying the phenomena of moisture transfer towards the core.<br>
The initial temperature t1 necessary for the boiled sugar to allow its effective passage through the opening, ensuring precise dimensioning of the band on the roller, is between 75 and 95°C, preferably between 85 and 92°C.<br>
The initial temperature is chosen such that the mass of boiled sugar is in a state of low viscosity allowing its dimensioning through the opening. If the mass is too viscous because of an excessively low temperature, the band cannot be dimensioned on the roller or at least not to the desired dimensions and the opening risks being partially or completely blocked by the material. An excessive initial temperature may also cause flowing of the band which sags on the surface of the roller.<br>
The final temperature t2 of the band during its deposition is, for its part, between 25 and 40°C, preferably 32 and 37°C. The final temperature of the material is also important because it determines the plastic state of the material. If the band is too hot, it does not become easily detached, which can lead to<br><br>
tearing or to extension thereof. On the other hand, a band in a state of excessive hardening will be able to become easily detached but will not fold after deposition on the core base and coating will not be   performed properly.<br>
Of course the temperature values may vary somewhat depending on the type of boiled sugar used and its formulation, depending for example on whether it is caramel, marshmallow, nougat or the like. It should also be noted that the band does not have a uniform temperature over its entire cross section. A temperature gradient of several degrees is observed between the surface of the band in contact over the roller and the external surface of the band. A degree of temperature reequilibration inside the band is established, however, when the band leaves the surface of the roller. The temperatures given are understood to mean, however, mean temperatures for a given section in the band.<br>
It has been possible to determine, by appropriate viscosity measurements, that the plastic viscosity of the material based on boiled sugar in the range of flexibility to bending considered is preferably between 4000 and 10 000 poises for a shearing rate of between 2 and 8 second-2, and preferably between 4500 and 7600 poises. Boiled sugar being a viscous product with a non-Newtonian behaviour, its viscosity depends on the shearing threshold considered.<br>
Precise control of the temperatures of the band is essentially obtained by precisely adjusting the temperature of the cooling roller and the speed at which the roller advances. Thus, the roller is generally maintained at a constant temperature of the order of 18 to 22°C, preferably 20°C+/-1°C for an advancing speed of the order of 4-7 m/min, preferably 5-6 m/min. The roller is cooled by internal circulation of cooling fluid such as water or a mixture of water and glycerol.  The dimensions of the roller may be<br><br>
variable. However, the diameter of the roller is preferably between 90 cm to 1.5 m, preferably about 1 metre.<br>
In a first possible mode, the roller is rotated in the opposite direction to the direction corresponding to the direction of travel of the core base so that after its detachment, the band forms a loop open on the forward side; the surface of contact of the band with the roller then being the surface of contact on the core base. This particular mode has the advantage of allowing the depositing on the external surface of pieces of inclusions such as cereals, nuts, dried fruit, chocolate chips, sweets or the like. The deposition preferably takes place after application of the band over the roller and before its detachment from the roller. Advantage is thus taken of the relatively pasty state of the band in order to obtain the adhesion of the solid inclusions which, during contact with the band, are retained by it. As it descends onto the roller, the adhesion of the inclusions is secured by the gradual hardening of the band. The deposition of components on the roller is an aspect of the invention which is itself advantageous relative to traditional processes under a curtain since it makes it possible to obtain greater evenness of the deposition over all the surfaces of the products. Indeed, in the technique under a curtain, the deposition of inclusions is performed after coating the core with boiled sugar and therefore the vertical sides of the coating offer a less strong adhesion compared with the top surface of the coating. Unevenness in the density of inclusions between the top and the sides of the coating therefore results from the traditional process. By contrast, according to the invention, the deposition is carried out on a flat band, therefore promoting a homogeneous distribution of inclusions.<br>
According to a possible alternative, the roller is driven in rotation in the direction corresponding to the  direction of  movement  of  the  core  base;  the<br><br>
external surface of the band over the roller then becomes the surface in contact over the core base. This mode has the advantage of promoting the adhesion of the band to the base because of the fact that the external surface of the band over the roller is in general a few degrees hotter than the surface in direct contact with the roller. It is therefore possible to take advantage of this temperature variation or gradient in the band in order to promote its adhesion.<br>
According to a preferred mode, several continuous bands, arranged parallel to each other on the roller, are applied to the roller. For this purpose, a reservoir is available which contains the molten mass of confectionery based on boiled sugar which is placed over the roller. The reservoir comprises a dimensioning comb provided with a series of several openings which allow the dimensioning of a series of several continuous parallel bands on the roller for the coating of a series of several core bases passing continuously and in parallel on a conveying means placed below the cooling roller. The series of several core bases is obtained by cutting into portions a sheet of larger width and laterally separating the portions by a separating means according to a defined lateral separation greater than the opened-out width of the bands to be deposited.<br>
According to another mode, the deposition of the layer of confectionery is obtained successively by putting in place at least two rollers arranged in series, at least a first roller depositing a first band thickness over the core base, and then at least a second roller depositing a second band thickness by superposition over the first. Such an arrangement has the advantage of being able to manage a wide range of dimensions of the confectionery layer both in terms of thickness and in terms of width. In particular, it is possible to produce high coating thicknesses of the order of 5 to 7 mm. It is also possible to vary the thickness in some parts of the structure by depositing<br><br>
different band widths, for example. It is also possible to carry out coatings of materials whose nature and/or characteristics are different, such as for example the deposition of a first layer of caramel (innermost layer) followed by that of a second layer consisting of nougat or conversely.<br>
According to the invention, the layer of boiled sugar confectionery serving to form the coating is chosen from preparations based on caramel, chewy paste, marshmallow and nougat. The formulation generally comprises an emulsion consisting of sugar, water, fat and optionally proteins, and possesses a cooking temperature varying between about 120 and 130°C.<br>
The core of the bar is preferably a wafer or a stack of several layers of wafers with intermediate coating of filling cream such as a praline. However, the core may also consist of a biscuit base, an ice cream base or a hardened boiled sugar such as a nougat or any of its combinations.<br>
Finally, the bars may be coated completely or partially with chocolate after cutting into portions.<br>
Finally, the invention also relates to a device for manufacturing confectionery bars of the type comprising a core in three dimensions coated with a layer of confectionery material based on boiled sugar at least partially coating the said core; the said device comprising:<br>
a conveying means  for the passage of  a continuous line of material to be coated;<br>
- at least one cooling roller situated above the conveying means comprising a cylindrical surface;<br>
a heated reservoir for receiving the confectionery mass in a form which can be spread over the surface of the roller;<br>
characterized in that it comprises, at the outlet of the reservoir, a dimensioning means allowing the dimensioning of at least one band on the roller, the said means comprising an opening limited both in a direction parallel to the surface of the roller so as<br><br>
to dimension the band in thickness and in a vertical direction so as to dimension the band in width, in order to obtain a dimensioned band over the surface of the roller which is capable of being applied over a continuous line forming the core to be coated.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a method for manufacturing individual confectionery bars comprising a core in three dimensions and at least one layer of confectionery material based on boiled sugar at least partially coating the said core, characterized in that: at least one continuous band of confectionery material based on boiled sugar is dimensioned in the hot state on a cooling roller; after sufiBcient cooling, the band is detached from the roller and the band is deposited on a continuously passing base intended to form the core of the bars;, the depositing being performed by bringing the band into contact substantially on depositing plane (P) adjacent to the most elevated surface/line of contact of the base; the band being brought, at the time of depositing, into a viscoplastic state which allows it to bend under its own weight so as to at least partially cover the sides of the said base situated under the said surface/line of contact, this deformation of the band occurs by bending the free portions over the base of the core and without significant modifications of the initial dimensions of the band as defined during the application of the band to the said roller and portions of desired length are then cut.<br>

Figure 13 shows the coated product of Figure 12;<br><br>
Figure 14 shows an example of a product to be coated having a triangular shape;<br>
Figure 15 shows the coated product of Figure 14.<br>
A first form of a coating installation 10 for carrying out the process is shown in Figure 1. The installation includes a conveying device 20, such as conveyor belt, arranged horizontally for conveying a series of wafers 30, 31, 32 of individual length L1. The wafers are arranged end to end on the conveyor belt so as to define a continuous base 3 to be coated intended to form the core of the final product. The base 3 therefore moves in a direction of horizontal movement I.<br>
Above the conveying device, there is arranged a coating device which comprises a cooling roller 4 having a cylindrical surface 40. The cylindrical surface is preferably a smooth surface. The roller is mounted on an axis of rotation 0 substantially transverse to the direction of movement I of the wafer base. A reservoir 5 for receiving a molten confectionery mass 8, such as caramel, is mounted in an upper part of the roller 4. Heating means are preferably attached to the reservoir in order to maintain the mass in a liquid or semiliquid state, at a constant temperature of the order of 85-95°C. The reservoir is open at the bottom such that the confectionery mass contained in the reservoir is capable of entering into permanent contact with the roller by gravity.<br>
As shown in Figure 2, the reservoir possesses a calibrating means 60 forming a comb for the dimensioning in parallel of a series 7 of confectionery bands 7a, 7b, 7c, 7d. The bands are arranged vertically above a corresponding series of several core bases 3a, 3b, 3c, 3d which pass continuously on the conveying means 20. The dimensioning means 60 is composed of a series of parallel openings 61 made in the wall of the reservoir in a number corresponding to the number of<br><br>
bands to be deposited over the cooling roller. Each opening 61 is individually dimensioned in width L and in thickness e in order to form an individual band in the desired dimensions. A micrometric system of adjusting the thickness and/or the width which can be individually controllered for each opening may be advantageously introduced in order to make it possible to refine the dimensions of each of the bands, in particular so as to compensate for the temperature variations in the reservoir (this system itself not represented).<br>
Each band 7 is deposited through the effect of rotating the cooling roller which cools the bottom-most layer of the confectionery mass 8 in the reservoir so that it adheres by viscosity to the surface of the roller and so that it is dimensioned by passing through the opening 61. During its angular passage over the roller, the confectionery band cools gradually and its viscosity increases proportionally, thus leading to the formation of a band having some strength until it reaches a bottom point of the roller where it is then detached by means of a scraper 80 arranged tangentially to the roller. The temperature of the roller as well as the speed of rotation of the roller are parameters regulated according to the specific properties of the mass to be cooled and the viscoplastic state in which the mass is desired so as to obtain its capacity to bend at the time of application to the base to be coated. The angular arrangement of the reservoir also depends on these desired final properties. In general, the reservoir is arranged such that the band travels through an angular range of between 18 0 and 270 degrees, preferably between 190 and 220 degrees (limits included).<br>
In some cases, the band is capable of becoming detached by itself, by the pulling effect of the coated portion, without it being necessary to have a scraper. However, excessive pulling is not desirable and may result in an undesirable extension of the band, so that<br><br>
it will be preferable for the speed of rotation of the roller to be substantially identical to the speed of passage of the base 3 on the conveying means.<br>
In the case represented, provision is made for deposition of cereals, such as puffed rice or the like, using a hopper 9 placed substantially vertically over the centre of the roller and at the outflow from dimensioning. Thus, cereals are supplied by gravity onto the band of confectionery mass at a stage where the band retains a high capacity for adhering to particles of low mass. The adhesion of cereals is ensured throughout the journey by gradual increase in the viscosity of the band. As shown in Figure 3, the band, having reached a satisfactory viscoplastic level related to its journey on the roller, is deposited on the top of the wafer 3 in a corresponding horizontal plane of deposition P, in the case illustrated representing a wafer having a substantially rectangular section, on the top surface 34 of the wafer.<br>
It should be noted that the band between the line of detachment from the roller and the line of deposition on the wafer forms a loop 72, which is open in the direction of advance I, such that the external surface 70 of the band carrying the cereal or other inclusions 90 constitutes the external face of the coating on the wafer and the surface of contact 71 on the roller constitutes the internal face for adhesion to the wafer. The height H1 between the line of detachment and the conveyor belt may be optimized so that the band reaches the viscoplastic state for the folding effect expected at the time of deposition on the wafer. For this purpose, trials have shown that a height of the order of 4 to 15 cm, preferably 5-8 cm is optimum.<br>
Preferably, the band projects beyond on each side of the bar at the time of deposition and the width L of the band substantially corresponds to the development of the top surface 34, and of the side surfaces 35, 36 of the wafer so that the band can fully<br><br>
and exactly cover the visible parts of the wafer. Figure 4 shows the intermediate stage during which the free parts 73, 74 of the band sag by the effect of their own weight, and then Figure 5 shows the covering of the band with complete folding and adhesion of the free parts 73, 74 to the wafer. The expression "free parts" is understood to mean the band portions which are distant from the surfaces of the wafer to be coated at the time of bringing the band into contact with the wafer. In this case, in the example of a wafer with a rectangular section, the free parts constitute the lateral faces of the coating intended to cover the sides of the wafer. According to an important aspect of the invention, at the time of the deposition along the defined plane P, the band should be in a non-solidified, supple and plastic state which makes it possible to develop a capacity for folding from the plane P through an angle of deformation greater than 20 degrees, preferably of 45 to 90 degrees. It is thus possible to quantify the deformation of the band by the measurement of the angle formed by the free parts of the band when they fold, this being from a horizontal reference corresponding to the plane of deposition. In the case where the band has a folding capacity of less than 2 0 degrees, because of an excessively high stiffness by the effect of advanced hardening or by the effect of the thickness, it is then difficult to envisage a covering of a confectionery surface according to the invention. It is also important for the band to be such that it can be folded without undergoing creep or extension which would modify its initial dimensions in a manner which is difficult to control. A slight creep may however be accepted to the extent that it would not appear visually as a defect on the coated product. It is also important to note that at the surface, the band should retain a capacity to adhere to the surfaces to be coated. The surface of contact should therefore preferably retain a relatively pasty  and  not  completely  solidified  quality while<br><br>
having a certain strength in order to be able to be separated from the roller by scraping means.<br>
As shown in Figure 1, the solidification of the continuous band of confectionery mass once folded and stuck to the base continues along the conveyor until it is cut into individual bar portions by an appropriate cutting means 81 such as a mechanical cutting system or by ultrasound. The following step is the coating of the bars with a chocolate layer by any means such as by immersing in a molten chocolate mass or spraying of a molten chocolate mass (this stage not represented).<br>
Figure 6 shows the final confectionery product ready for packaging after coating with an external layer of chocolate. The core of the product itself comprises a succession of layers of waffle 3 7 and of layers 38 of filling cream. The boiled sugar coating 7 covers the top and side faces of the core and comprises inclusions 90. Finally, an external layer of chocolate 91 constitutes the final coating.<br>
Figures 7 and 8 show the arrangement of an installation according to one variant. The wafers are obtained from waffle sheets 29 as illustrated in Figures 9 and 10. These sheets have a length L1 and a width L2 designed to allow the coating widthwise of a plurality of individual wafers 3a, 3b, 3c and the like. The width L2 is a multiple of the width I2 of each of the individual wafers such that it is possible to coat a defined number of wafers in the said sheet, for example 23 individual wafers of width I2 and length L1 in the present case. Each waffle sheet advantageously comprises a sandwich structure comprising a super¬position of waffle layers 37a, 37b, 37c with a layer of filling cream 38a, 38b placed between each waffle layer. The filling layer may advantageously be a praline-flavoured cream or the like.<br>
The waffle sheets 3 9 are obtained by spreading a filling cream over a waffle layer, placing a new waffle layer on top and then pressing the waffle layers<br><br>
together and so on until the desired number of waffle layers is obtained.<br>
Each whole waffle sheet 3 9 is transported on a conveyor belt 21 up to a cutting station 22. The sheet is fitted between a pushing means 2 3 and a cutting means 24. The pushing means is driven in a to-and-fro longitudinal movement which causes the sheet 3 9 to pass through the cutting means which consists of a cutting grid provided with a series of vertically oriented cutting blades or wires. The wafers 30 as cut from the sheet are then separated individually on a sliding plate to give a lateral separation determined by a separating means as in a needle separating station 25. The station is provided in the form of a transporting device 2 7 overhanging the cut waffle sheet and comprises a separating slide 28 which can be moved along the transporting device and is equipped with needles 2 9 which separate the wafers. The support-mounted needles are driven in a vertical to-and-fro movement for inserting the needles into each sheet in the separating station. Of course, the distance separating the wafers is determined according to the position of the bands on the roller, their width and the relative distance separating them. A lateral separation between each wafer of the order of 1 to 5 cm is preferable so as to have a high processing capacity while limiting the size of the installations.<br>
The wafers 30 thus positioned with their lateral separation are transported on a conveying means 20 in the direction of the actual coating line 10. For this purpose, continuous lines of wafers arranged in a joined-up manner in the direction of passage are prepared, as explained above in the example of Figure 1. The coating line comprises two coating stations 10a, 10b separated longitudinally on the line forming a series of two rollers 4a, 4b mounted in series. A first roller 4a is rotated in the direction of passage I of the conveying means so as to allow deposition on the wafers of a series 75a of parallel<br><br>
bands of boiled sugar with the characteristic that the external surface of the bands on the roller becomes the adhering surface over the wafers. This surface being slightly hotter compared with the surface in contact with the roller, the adhering of these first bands with the wafers is thus favoured.<br>
The second coating station 10b is mounted in the opposite direction with a roller 4b rotated in the opposite direction to the direction of passage. It is thus possible to place on the top part of the roller a means 9 intended for the deposition of solid inclusions such as cereals, nuts and other dried fruit, or sweets or chocolate chips or the like. This means is generally a hopper with an adjustable opening directed over the roller and linked to a vibrator. A recovering system 91 is placed horizontally, vertically beneath the vertical tangent to the surface of the roller so as to recover the parts which can become detached from the bands.<br>
The arrangement of two coating stations in series according to the invention allows a wide choice of coating thickness which may range from 1 mm when a single station is in operation to a maximum of 7-8 mm when the two stations are in action. Above 3.5 to 4 mm per band, an increased stiffness is observed which leads to a folding capacity insufficient to obtain correct coating and adhering of the bands. The maximum thickness per band may however vary according to the nature of the coating materials and according to the temperature conditions and adjustment of the device.<br>
The operation which follows the coating of the wafers consists in cutting portions 300 of desired length by a cutting means as shown in Figure 11. The length L3 of the portions may be independent of, and is generally less than, the length L2 of the end-to-end portions 30 of the wafers just after coating. Coating with boiled sugar has the advantage of integrally attaching the portions 3 0 to each other so as to form a continuous coated base which can be easily cut at any possible desired site<br><br>
It is understood that the coating of the bar may be complemented by the deposition of a lower layer of boiled sugar in contact with the lower surface of the core (not represented). For that, it is possible to envisage depositing, using an additional roller, a flat dimensioned layer of boiled sugar over the conveyor belt. The band is then dimensioned in the desired manner in terms of thickness and width. The waffle is then tangentially applied to the flat layer of sugar, which has not yet completely hardened so as to obtain the adhesion of the waffle to the bottom layer. The operations for coating the other faces are carried out as described in the preceding examples.<br>
Figures 12 to 15 illustrate various variants of possible forms of coated bars according to the invention. Figures 12 and 13 show the arrangement of a confectionery band by viscoplastic folding over a core of hemispherical transverse section. In this case, the band is applied on a plane of deposition P adjacent to the most elevated line or to the tangent to the curve O of the core base. Figures 14 and 15 show the arrangement of a band over a core of triangular transverse section.<br>
Of course, other forms of the base in three dimensions are possible such as a square or trapezoidal shape, for example. In all cases, the object to be coated possesses a surface to be coated in three dimensions and the deposition is carried out along the most elevated line or surface of the base before the free parts fold themselves down over the edges of the base, taking advantage of the folding capacity of the boiled sugar material.<br>
It is observed that by operating according to the method described, a surprising uniformity of coating thickness is obtained over all the faces covered; which uniformity could not be obtained up until now in the relevant thickness ranges and by traditional processes. Such a uniformity participates in a better general quality of the product, and a more<br><br>
homogeneous texture and consistency. A better distribution of the solid inclusions embedded in the confectionery is observed. A significant reduction in the proportion of mass to be recycled is also observed.<br>
Various examples of boiled sugar mass which may be suitable for the coating are given in the following examples.<br>
Example 1;<br>
A mint-flavoured confectionery mass of the chewy paste type is produced in the following manner. 12 kg of frappe are prepared from 50% by weight of egg albumin and 50% by weight of water. There is added to the frappe a sweetened mass heated to a cooking temperature of 126°C and consisting of 100 kg of glucose syrup, 100 kg of sugar and 12 kg of fat. The frappe is mixed with the sweetened mass at the cooking temperature and mixed. The reservoir is filled and it is maintained at a temperature of the order of 90°C for passage to the cylinder.<br>
Example 2;<br>
A caramel mass is produced in the following manner. 5 kg of 14 0 bloom gelatin is obtained by immersing 50% by weight of gelatin in 50% by weight of water. There is added a sugar mass heated to 129°C and composed of 100 kg of glucose syrup, 60 kg of sugar and 15 kg of fat. The 140 bloom gelatin is mixed with the sugar mass. The reservoir is filled and it is maintained at a temperature of the order of 90°C for passage to the cylinder.<br>
Example 3;<br>
The ingredients for a marshmallow mass and a nougat mass are the following:<br><br><br>
Example 4;<br>
The marshmallow mass is obtained by cooking portion 1 at 123°C in order to obtain a syrup. Portion 1 is added to portion 2 and is then whipped in a high-speed planetary beater. Portion 3 is added at low speed and then transferred into the reservoir.<br>
Example 5;<br>
The nougat mass is obtained by cooking portion 1 at 12 0°C until a syrup is obtained which is then added to portion 2. Portions 1 and 2 are whipped in a high-speed planetary beater. Next, portion 3 is added at low speed and the mixture is transferred to the reservoir.<br>
Example 6;<br>
A caramel of the type in Example 2 is subjected to a viscosity measuring trial at the temperature of 3 5°C corresponding to the average temperature for deposition over the wafer. The results are the following:<br><br><br><br><br><br>
