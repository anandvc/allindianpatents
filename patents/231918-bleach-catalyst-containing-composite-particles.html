				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to bleach catalyst-containing particles, and to the preparation of these bleach catalyst-containing particles. These particles are particularly useful components of detergent compositions, such as laundry detergent compositions, hard surface cleaners, and especially automatic dishwashing detergent compositions.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Automatic dishwashing, particularly in domestic appliances, is an art very different from fabric laundering. Domestic fabric laundering is normally done in purpose-built machines having a tumbling action. These are very different from spray-action domestic automatic dishwashing appliances. The spray action in the latter tends to cause foam. Foam can easily overflow the low sills of domestic dishwashers and slow down the spray action, which in turn reduces the cleaning action. Thus in the distinct field of domestic machine dishwashing, the use of common foam-producing laundry detergent surfactants is normally restricted. These aspects are but a brief illustration of the unique formulation constraints in the domestic dishwashing field.<br>
Automatic dishwashing with bleaching chemicals is different from fabric bleaching. In automatic dishwashing, use of bleaching chemicals involves promotion of soil removal from dishes, though soil bleaching may also occur. Additionally, soil antiredeposition and anti-spotting effects from bleaching chemicals would be desirable. Some bleaching chemicals, (such as a hydrogen peroxide source, alone or together with tetraacetylethylenediamine, TAED) can, in certain circumstances, be helpful for cleaning dishware, but this technology gives far from satisfactory results in a dishwashing context: for example, ability to remove tough tea stains is limited, especially in hard water, and requires rather large amounts of bleach. Other bleach activators developed for laundry use can even give negative effects, such as creating unsightly deposits, when put into an automatic dishwashing product, especially when they have overly low solubility. Other bleach systems can damage items unique to dishwashing, such as silverware, aluminium cookware or certain plastics.<br><br>
Consumer glasses, dishware and flatware, especially decorative pieces, as washed in domestic automatic dishwashing appliances, are often susceptible to damage and can be expensive to replace. Typically, consumers dislike having to separate finer pieces and would prefer the convenience and simplicity of being able to combine all their tableware and cooking utensils into a'single, automatic washing operation. Yet doing this as a matter of routine has not yet been achieved,<br>
On account of the foregoing technical constraints as well as consumer needs and demands, automatic dishwashing detergent (ADD) compositions are undergoing continual change and improvement. Moreover environmental factors such as the restriction of phosphate, the desirability of providing ever-better cleaning results with less product, providing less thermal energy, and less water to assist the washing, process, have all driven the need for improved ADD compositions.<br>
A recognized need in ADD compositions is to have present one or more ingredients which improve the removal of hot beverage stains (e.g., tea, coffee, cocoa, etc.) from consumer articles. Strong alkalis like sodium hydroxide, bleaches such as hypochlorite, builders such as phosphates and the like can help in varying degrees but all can also be damaging to, or leave a film upon, glasses, dishware or silverware. Accordingly, milder ADD compositions have been developed. These make use of a source of hydrogen peroxide, optionally with a bleach activator such as TAED, as noted. Further, enzymes such as commercial amylolytic enzymes (e.g., TERMAMYL® available from Novo Nordisk S/A) can be added. The alpha-amylase component provides at least some benefit in the starchy soil removal properties of the ADD. ADD's containing amylases typically can deliver a somewhat more moderate wash pH in use and can remove starchy soils while avoiding delivering large weight equivalents of sodium hydroxide on a per-gram-of-product basis. It would therefore be highly desirable to secure improved bleach activators specifically designed to be compatible in ADD formulations, especially with enzymes such as amylases. A need likewise exists to secure better amylase action in the presence of bleach activators. Also, enzymes such as commercial protease enzymes (e.g., SAVINASE® available from Novo Nordisk S/A) can be added.<br>
Certain manganese catalyst-containing machine dishwashing compositions are described in U.S. Patent 5,246,612, issued September 21, 1993, to Van Dijk et al. The compositions are said to be chlorine bleach-free machine dishwashing compositions comprising amylase and a manganese catalyst (in the +3 or +4 oxidation state), as defined by the structure given therein. Preferred manganese<br><br>
catalyst therein is a dinuclear manganese, macrocyclic ligand-containiLg molecule said to be MnIV2(u-0)3(l,4,7-trimethyl-l,4!7-triazacyclononane)2(PF6)2.<br>
It has been discovered more recently that cobalt-containing bleach catalysts are particularly effective for use in bleach compositions such as automatic dishwashing compositions.<br>
However, the direct incorporation of the small bleach catalyst particles at the typically very low levels into a paniculate detergent composition can present problems. Such granular compositions typically should be made up c-f particles having mean particle sizes which are all similar to each other, to avoid segregation of components in the composition. Such compositions often comprise particles having mean particles sizes hi a defined range of from about 400 to about 2400, microns, more usually from about 500 to about 2000 microns, to achieve good flow and absence of dustiness properties. Any fine or oversize particles outside of these limits must generally be removed by sieving to avoid a particle segregation problem. Addition of fine panicle bleach catalysts into conventional granular detergent products thus potentially presents a component separation problem. Fine bleach catalyst particles in a detergent composition matrix may also have chemical stability problems caused by a tendency of the fine particles to interact with other detergent composition components, such as the other bleach system components.<br>
In light of all this, the formulator may very well wish to incorporate small bleach catalyst particles, preferred for stain removal performance, into a detergent matrix containing other components having a generally larger overall mean particle size distribution. In so doing, however, the formulator must avoid the component segregation and chemical stability problems associated with the use of snail bleach catalyst particles in this context. The formulator must also maximize the consumer acceptance of the aesthetics of the compositions.<br>
Given the foregoing considerations, it is an object of the present invention to provide bleach catalyst-containing composite particles which are useful for incorporating bleach catalysts into granular detergent products, preferably automatic dishwashing detergent products in a form which maximizes its stain removal performance, chemical stability and consumer acceptable aesthetics, but which minimizes its particle segregation problems. It is a further object of lie present invention to incorporate such bleach catalyst-containing composite particles in the form of flakes, micropastilles or extrudates which, while having a size distribution comparable to that of the other components of the granular detergent composition, allow deliver)' of bleach catalyst particles into the wash solution. Such objectives<br><br>
can be realized by preparing and using bleach catalyst-containing composite particles in accordance with the instant invention.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
U.S. Patent 4,810,410, to Diakun et al, issued March 7,1989; U.S. 5,246,612, to Van Dijk et al., issued September 21, 1993; U.S. 5,244,594, to Favre et al,, issued September 14, 1993; and European Patent Application, Publication No. 408,131, published January 16, 1991 by Unilever NV. See also: U.S. Patent 5,114,611, to Van Kralingen et al, issued May 19, 1992 (transition metal complex of a transition metal, such as cobalt, and a non-macro-cyclic ligand); U.S. Pat. 4,430,243, to Bragg, issued February 7, 1984 (laundry, bleaching compositions comprising catalytic heavy metal cations, including cobalt); German Patent Specification 2,054,019, published October 7, 1971 by Unilever N.V. (cobalt chelant catalyst); and European Patent Application Publication No. 549,271, published June 30, 1993 by Unilever PLC (macrocyclic organic ligands in cleaning compositions).<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to bleach catalyst-containing composite particles suitable for incorporation into granular detergent compositions, said composite particles comprising:<br>
(a)	from about 1% to about 60% of bleach catalyst; and<br>
(b)	from about 40% to about 99% of carrier material that melts within the<br>
range of from about 38°C to about 77°C, preferably selected from the group<br>
consisting of polyethylene glycols, paraffin waxes, and mixtures thereof;<br>
and wherein further said composite particles have a mean particle size of from about 200 to about 2400 microns. Preferred particles have a free water content of less than about 10% by weight. The particles may also optionally contain diluent materials.<br>
The process of the present invention involves the preparation of bleach catalyst-containing composite particles suitable for incorporation into granular detergent compositions as described hereinbefore, especially granular automatic dishwashing detergent products. Such a process comprises the steps of<br>
(a) combining the bleach catalyst particles with a molten carrier material which melts within the range of from about 38°C to 77°C, while agitating the resulting particle-earner combination to form a substantially uniform admixture of the panicles and the carrier material;<br><br>
(b)	cooling the particle-carrier admixture of Step (a) to form a solidified<br>
admixture of particles and carrier material; and<br>
(c)	further working the solidified particle-carrier material admixture formed<br>
in Step (b) if or as necessary to form the desired composite particles.<br>
The present invention also relates to the bleach catalyst-containing composite particles as prepared by the process herein and to detergent compositions, especially automatic dishwashing detergent products, which utilize these bleach catalyst-containing composite particles.<br>
The composite particles of this invention comprise both discrete bleach catalyst particles of relatively small particle size and a carrier material, with the composite particles having a mean particle size which is comparable to that of the other conventional component particles used in granular detergent compositions. Such particles thus allow for delivery to a wash solution of small particles of bleach catalyst when the carrier material in the composite particles dissolves away in the aqueous wash solution, thereby releasing the bleach catalyst particles.<br>
While other particle forms are possible, the composite particles of this invention are preferably in the form of flakes or micropastilles. The particles (e.g. flakes and micropastilles) have been found to exhibit enhanced storage stability in the presence of a detergent matrix. Further, the composite particles do not segregate from other particles in the granular detergent compositions into which they are incorporated. Finally, compositions containing such composite particles provide a more consumer acceptable speckled appearance than compositions having individual bleach catalyst particles.<br><br>
According to the present invention there is provided a bleach catalyst-containing composite particle suitable for incorporation into a granular detergent composition, said composite particle comprising:<br>
(a)	from 1 % to 60% of a bleach catalyst having the formula<br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br>
wherein cobalt is in the +3 oxidation state; n is 4 or 5; M is one or more ligands coordinated to the cobalt by one site; m is 0, 1 or 2; B is a ligand coordinated to the cobalt by two sites; b is 0 or 1, and when b=0, then m+n=6, and when b=l, then m=0 and n=4; and T is one or more appropriately selected counteranions present in a number y, where y is an integer to obtain a charge-balanced salt; said catalyst having a base hydrolysis rate constant of less than 0.23 m-1 s. (25°C.);<br>
(b)	from 40% to 99% of polyethylene glycol carrier material that melts within the<br>
range of from 38°C to 77°C;<br>
and wherein further said composite particles have a mean particle size of from about 200 to about 2400 microns and a free water content of less than 6%.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The particles according to the present invention comprise discrete particles of bleach catalyst and a carrier material. These particles may optionally contain other components, such as stabilizing additives and/or diluents. Each of these materials, the steps in the composite particle preparation process, the composite particles so prepared and granular (e.g. automatic dishwashing) detergents containing these particles are described in detail as follows:<br>
Bleach Catalyst<br>
The composite particles in accordance with the present invention comprise from about 1 % to about 60% by weight, more preferably from about 2% to about 20% by weight, most preferably from about 3% to about 10% by weight of the composite of discrete particles of bleach catalyst. These bleach catalyst particles<br><br>
typically and preferably have a mean particle size of less than about 300 microns, preferably less than about 200 microns, more preferably from about 1 to about 150 microns, most preferably from about 10 to about 100 microns. The bleach catalyst material can comprise the free acid form, the salts, and the like.<br>
One type of bleach catalyst is a catalyst system comprising a transition metal cation of defined bleach catalytic activity, such as copper, iron, titanium, ruthenium tungsten, molybenum, or manganese cations, an auxiliary metal cation having little or no bleach catalytic activity, such as zinc or. aluminum cations, and a sequestrate having defined stability constants for the catalytic and auxiliary metal cations, particularly ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, ethylenediaminetetra (methylenephosphonic acid) and water-soluble salts thereof. Such catalysts are disclosed in U.S. Pat. 4,430,243.<br>
Other types of bleach catalysts include the manganese-based complexes disclosed in U.S. Pat. 5,246,621 and U.S. Pat. 5,244,594. Preferred examples of theses catalysts include Mn^r2(u-0)3(l,4,7-trimethyl-1,4,7-triazacyclononane)2-(PF6)2, MnIII2(u-0)1(u-OAc)2(l,4,7-trimethyl-l,4,7-tria2acyclononane)2-(C104)2, MnIV4(u-0)6(l,4,7-triazacyclononane)4-(C104)2,MnIIIMnIV4(u-O)1(u-<br>
OAc)2(l,4,7-trimethyl-l,4,7-triazacyclononane)2-(C104)3, and mixtures thereof. Others are described in European patent application publication no. 549,272. Other ligands suitable for use herein include l,5,9'trimemyl-1,5,9-triazacyclododecane, 2-methyl-l,4,7-triazacyclononane, 2-methyl-l,4,7-triazacyclononane, and mixtures thereof.<br>
The bleach catalysts useful in automatic dishwashing compositions and concentrated powder detergent compositions may also be selected as appropriate for the present invention. For examples of suitable bleach catalysts see U.S. Pat. 4,246,612 and U.S. Pat. 5,227,084.<br>
See also U.S. Pat. 5,194,416 which teaches mononuclear manganese (IV) complexes such as Mn(l,4,7-trirne±yl-l,4,7-triazacyclononane(OCH3)3.(PF6).<br>
Still another type of bleach catalyst, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. 5,114,606, is a water-soluble complex of manganese (II), (III), and/or (IV) with a ligand which is a non-carboxylate. polyhydroxy compound having at least three consecutive C-OH groups. Preferred ligands include sorbitol, iditol, dulsitol, mannitol, xylithol, arabitol, adonitol, meso-erythritol, rneso-inositol, lactose, and mixtures thereof.<br>
U.S. Pat. 5,114,611 teaches a bleach catalyst comprising a complex of transition metals, including Mn, Co, Fe, or Cu, with an non-(macro)-cyclic ligand. Said ligands are of the formula:<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein R1, R2, R3, and R4 can each be selected from H, substituted alkyl and aryl<br>
groups such that each R1-N=C-R- and R3-C=N-R4 form a five or six-membered<br>
ring. Said ring can further be substituted. B is a bridging group selected from 0, S.<br>
CR5R6, NR7 and C=0, wherein R5, R6, and R7 can each be H, alkyl, or aryl<br>
groups, including substituted or unsubstituted groups. Preferred ligsnds include<br>
pyridine, pyridazine, pyrimidine, pyrazine, imidazole, pyrazole, and triazole rings.<br>
Optionally, said rings may be substituted with substituents such as alkyl, aryl,<br>
alkoxy, halide, and nitro. Particularly preferred is the ligand 2,2'-bispyridylamine.<br>
Preferred bleach catalysts include Co, Cu, Mn, Fe,-bispyridylmethane and -<br>
bispyridylamine complexes. Highly preferred catalysts include Co(2,2'-<br>
bispyridylamine)Cl2,	Di(isothiocyanato)bispyridylarnine«cobalt	(II),<br>
trisdipyridylamine-cobalt(II) perchlorate, Co(2,2-bispyridylarnine)202C104, Bis-(2,2'-bispyridylamine) copper(ll) perchlorate, tris(di-2-pyridylamine) iron(II) perchlorate, and mixtures thereof.<br>
Other examples include Mn gluconate, Mn(CF3S03)2, Co(NH3)5Cl, and the binuclear Mn complexed with tetra-N-dentate and bi-N-dentate ligands, including N4MnIII(u-0)2MnIVN4)+and[Bipy2MnIII(u.O)2MnIVbipy2]-(C104)3.<br>
The bleach catalysts may also be prepared by combining a water-soluble ligand with a water-soluble manganese salt in aqueous media and concentrating the resulting mixture by evaporation. Any convenient water-soluble salt of manganese can be used herein. Manganese (II), (III), (IV) and/or (V) is readily available on a commercial scale. In some instances, sufficient manganese may be present in the wash liquor, but, in general, it is preferred to detergent composition Mn cations in the compositions to ensure its presence in catalytically-effective amounts. Thus, the sodium salt of the ligand and a member selected from the group consisting of MnS04, Mn(CI04)2 or MnCl2 (least preferred) are dissolved in water at molar ratios of ligand :Mn salt in the range of about 1:4 to 4:1 at neutral or slightly alkaline pH. The water may first be de-oxygenated by boiling and cooled by spraying with nitrogen. The resulting solution is evaporated (under N2, if desired) and the resulting solids are used in the bleaching and detergent compositions herein without further purification.<br>
In an alternate mode, the water-soluble manganese source, such as MnSO4, is added to the bleach/cleaning composition or to the aqueous bleaching/cleaning bath which comprises the ligand. Some type of complex is apparently formed in si!u, and<br><br>
improved bleach performance is secured. In such an in situ process, it is convenient to use a considerable mclar excess of the ligand over the manganese, and mole ratios of ligand :Mn typically tre 3:1 to 15:1. The additional ligand also serves to scavenge vagrant metal ions such as iron and copper, thereby protecting the bleach from decomposition. One possible such system is described in European patent application, publication no, 549,271.<br>
While the structures of the bleach-catalyzing manganese complexes of the present invention have sot been elucidated, it may be speculated that they comprise chelates or other hydrated coordination complexes which result from the interaction of the carboxyl and nitrogen atoms of the ligand with the manganese cation. Likewise, the oxidation state of the manganese cation during the catalytic process is. not known with certainty, and may be the (+11), (+III), (+IV) or (+V) valence state. Due to the ligands' possible six points of attachment to the manganese cation, it may be reasonably speculated that multi-nuclear species and/or "cage" structures may exist in the aqueous bleaching media. Whatever the form of the active Mn-ligand species which actually exists, it functions in an apparently catalytic manner to provide improved bleaching performances on stubborn stains such as tea, ketchup, coffee, wine, juice, and the like.<br>
Other bleach catalysts are described, for example, in European patent application, publication no. 408,131 (cobalt complex catalysts), European patent applications, publication nos. 384,503, and 306,089 (metallo-porphyrin catalysts), U.S. 4,728,455 (manganese/multidentate ligand catalyst), U.S. 4,711,748 and European patent application, publication no. 224,952, (absorbed manganese on aluminosilicate catalyst), U.S. 4,601,845 (aluminosilicate support with manganese and zinc or magnesium salt), U.S. 4,626,373 (manganese/ligand catalyst), U.S. 4,119,557 (ferric complex catalyst), German Pat. specification 2,054,019 (cobalt chelant catalyst) Canadian 866,191 (transition metal-containing salts), U.S. 4,430,243 (chelants with manganese cations and non-catalytic metal cations), and U.S. 4,728,455 (manganese gluconate catalysts).<br>

Ammonium acetate (67.83 g, 0.880 mol) and ammonium hydroxide (256.62, 2,050 mol, 28%) are combined in a 1000 ml three-necked round-bottomed flask<br><br>
fitted with a condense:, mechanical stirrer, and internal thermometer, Cobalt(II) acetate tetrahydrate (110.00 g, 0.400 mol) is added to the clear solution that becomes brown-black once addition of the metal salt is complete. The mixture warms briefly to 40 °C. Hydrogen pero.xide (27.21 g, 0.400 mol, 50%) is added dropwise over 20 min.' The reaction warns to 60-65 °C and turns red as the peroxide is added to the reaction mixture, After stirring for an additional 20 min, the red mixture is treated with a solution of sodium nitrate (74.86 g, 0.880 mol) dissolved in 50 ml of water. As the mixture stands at room temperature, red crystals form. The solid is collected by filtration and washed with cold water and isopropanol to give 6.38 g (4.9%) of the complex as a red solid. The combined filtrates are concentrated by rotary evaporation (50-55 °C, 15 mm Hg (water aspirator vacuum)) to a slurry. The slurry. is filtered and the red solid remaining is washed with cold water and isopropanol to give 89.38 g (68.3%) cf the complex. Total yield: 95.76 g (73.1%). Analysis by HPLC, UV-Vis, and combustion are consistent with the proposed structure.<br>

Carrier material<br>
The bleach catalyst-containing composite particles comprise from about 40% to about 99% by weight, more preferably from about 50% to about 98% by weight, most preferably from about 60% to about 97% by weight of the composite particle of a carrier material. The carrier material melts in the range from about 38°C (100° F) to about 77°C (170eF), preferably from about 43°C (110°F) to about 71°C (160° F), most preferably from about 46°C (115°F) to 66°C (150°F).<br>
The carrier material should be inert to reaction with the bleach catalyst component of the particle under processing conditions and after solidification. Furthermore, the carrier material is preferably water-soluble. Additionally, the carrier material should preferably be substantially free of moisture present as unbound water.<br>
Polyethylene glycols, particularly those of molecular weight of from about 2000 to about 12000, more particularly from about 3000 to about 10000, and most preferably about 4000 (PEG 4000) to about 8000 (PEG 8000), have been found to be especially suitable water-soluble carrier materials herein. Such polyethylene glycols provide the advantages that, when present in the wash solution, they exhibit soil dispersancy properties and show little or no tendency to deposit as spots or films on the articles In the wash.<br><br>
Also suitable is carrier materials are paraffin waxes which should melt in the range of from about 38°C (100°F) to about 43°C 110°F), and C10 - C20 fatty acids and ethoxylatec C16-C20 alcohols. Carriers comprising mixtures of suitable carrier materials are also envisaged.<br>
Particle Water Content<br>
The composite particles should have a low tree water content to favor in-product stability and minimize the stickiness of the composite particles. The composite particles should thus preferably have a free water content of less than about 10%, preferably less than about 6%, more preferably less than about 3%, and most preferably less than 1%,<br>
Composite Particle Preparation Process<br>
The composite psrticles are made by a process comprising the following basic steps:<br>
(i)    combining the particles of bleach catalyst with the carrier material as<br>
hereinbefore described, while the carrier material is in a molten state and<br>
while agitaing this combination to form a substantially uniform<br>
admixture;<br>
(ii)   rapidly cooling the resultant admixture "in order to solidify it; and<br>
thereafter<br>
(iii)  further working the resulting solidified admixture, if necessary, to form the desired composite particles.<br>
(i) Combining/Mixing Step<br>
The purpose of the combining/mixing step is to ensure dispersion of the discrete bleach catalyst particles in the molten carrier material. In more detail, the combining/mixing step can be carried out using any suitable liquid/solid mixing equipment such as that described in Perry's Chemical Engineer's Handbook under 'Phase Contacting and Liquid/Solid Processing'. For example, the combining and subsequent mixing can be done in batch mode, using a simple agitated batch tank containing the molten carrier. The discrete bleach catalyst particles can be added to the molten carrier aod dispersed with an impeller. This is preferable for small batches which can be solidified quickly (for reasons hereinafter set forth).<br>
Alternatively, the combinmg/mixing can be done continuously. For example, a feeder'can be used to meter the bleach catalyst into the flowing molten carrier (e.g., through a powder eductor). The mixture can optionally be further<br><br>
dispersed using any suitable continuous liquid/solid mixing device such as an in¬line mixer (such as those described in Chapter 19 of James Y. Oldshue, Fluid Mixing Technology, McGraw Hill Publishing Co., 1983) or a static or motionless mixer (e.g. from Kenics Corporation) in which stationary elements successively divide and recombine portions of the fluid stream. The shear rate can be varied both to optimize dispersion and to determine the eventual bleach catalyst particle size that is obtained. In some applications, further bleach catalyst particle size reduction can be accomplished through use of a colloid mill as the continuous liquid/solid mixing device.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the combining/mixing step acts such as to break up any aggregates which may have formed in the bulk of the bleach catalyst.  It is. acceptable that the mixing step leads to a slight reduction in the overall mean particle size of the bleach catalyst particles.<br>
(ii) Cooling/Solidification and ParticleFonning Steps<br>
The combining/mixing step is followed by one or more subsequent steps involving cooling and thereby solidifying the mixture resulting from the combining/mixing step. Subsequent steps may also involve forming the composite particles therefrom. These steps encompass executions wherein the solidification and particle-forming aspects occur coincidentally or alternatively where these steps are carried out sequentially in either order of occurrence.<br>
In executions where solidification of the bulk mixture occurs, the particle is formed from the solidified mixture by use of any suitable comminution procedure, such as grinding procedures.<br>
Cooling and solidification can be carried out using any conventional equipment such as that described in Perry's Chemical Engineer's Handbook under 'Heat Exchangers for Solids'.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, which involves the making of flake-form composite particles, the solidification occurs by introducing the mixture onto a chill roll or cooling belt thus forming a layer of solid material on the roll or belt. This is followed by a step which comprises removing the layer of solid material from the roll or belt and thereafter comminuting of the removed solid material. This can be achieved, for example, by cutting the solid layer into smaller pieces, followed by reducing these pieces to an acceptable size using conventional size reduction equipment (e.g. Quadro Co-mil or a cage mill). The comminuted solidified material can be further worked as necessary by sieving the comminuted material to provide particles of the desired mean particle size and size distribution.<br><br>
In another preferred embodiment which involves making micropastille-form composite particles, the cooling, solidification and particle-forming aspects occur in an integral process involving the delivery of drops of the bleach catalyst particle/carrier material mixture through a feed orifice onto a cooling belt. The feed orifice is preferably chosen so as to favor formation of micropastilles having a mean particle size of from about 200 to about 2400 microns, more preferably from about 500 to about 2000 microns, and most preferably from about 600 to about 1400 microns. In such a process, further working of the solidified admixture is not necessary to achieve composite particles of the desired size.<br>
In still another preferred embodiment which involves making extruded composite particles, panicle formation takes place in an extrusion process in which, the bleach catalyst-pancle/carrier material mixture is extruded through a die plate into a cooling device (e.g., a cooling drum, fluidized bed cooler, etc.). The die plate orifices are preferably chosen so as to favor formarion of extrudates with a diameter between 400 - 1000 microns, preferably 500 - 900 microns, more preferably 600 -700 microns, and having a mean particle size (by sieving) of from about 200 to about 2,400 microns, more preferably from about 500 to about 2,000 microns, and most preferably from about 600 to about 1,400 microns. The solidified extrudates are then sieved to obtain composite particles of the desired size fraction.<br>
f<br>
(in) Optional Additional Steps<br>
A preferred additional step, particularly when flake or extrudate formation is involved, comprises the step of sieving the particles to obtain composite particles having a mean particle size of from about 200 to about 2400 microns, preferably from about 500 to about 2000 microns, most preferably from about 600 to about 1400 microns. Any oversize particles can be subjected to a size reduction step and any undersized particles can be reintroduced into the molten mixture of the combining/mixing step.<br>

In general, the pH values of the detergent compositions can vary during the course of the wash as a result of the water and soil present. The best procedure for determining whether a given composition has the herein-indicated pH values is as. follows: prepare an aqueous solution or dispersion of all the ingredients of the composition by mixing them in finely divided form with the required amount of water to have a 3000 ppm total concentration. Measure the pH using a conventional glass electrode at anibient temperature, within about 2 minutes of forming the solution or dispersion. To be clear, this procedure relates to pH measurement and is not intended to be construed as limiting of the detergent compositions in any way; for example, it is clearly envisaged that fully-formulated embodiments of the instant detergent compositions may comprise a variety of ingredients applied as coatings to other ingredients.<br>
Bleaches<br>
The detergent compositions contain an oxygen bleaching source. Oxygen bleach is employed h an amount sufficient to provide from 0.01% to about 8%, preferably from about 0.1% to about 5.0%, more preferably from about 0.3% to about 4.0%, most preferably from about 0.8% to about 3% of available oxygen (AvO) by weight of the detergent composition.<br>
Available oxygen of a detergent composition or a bleach component is the equivalent bleaching oxygen content thereof expressed as % oxygen. For example, commercially available sodium perborate monohydrate typically has an available oxygen content for bleaching purposes of about 15% (theory predicts a maximum of about 16%). Methods for determining available oxygen of a formula after manufacture share similar chemical principles but depend on whether the oxygen bleach incorporated therein is a simple hydrogen peroxide source such as sodium<br><br>
perborate or percarbonate, is an activated type (e.g., perborate with tetra-acetyl ethylenediamine) or comprises a performed peracid such as monoperphthalic acid, Analysis of peroxygen compounds is well-known in the an: see, for example, the publications of Swan, such as "Organic Peroxides", Vol. I, D. H. Swern, Editor; Wiley, New York, 1970, LC # 72-84965, incorporated by reference. See for example the calculation of "percent active oxygen" at page 499. This term is equivalent to the terms "available oxygen" or "percent available oxygen" as used herein,<br>
The peroxygen bleaching systems useful herein are those capable of yielding hydrogen peroxide in an aqueous liquor. These compounds include but are not limited to the alkali metal peroxides, organic peroxide bleaching compounds such as , urea peroxide and inorganic persalt bleaching compounds such as the alkali metal perborates, percarbonates, perphosphates, and the like. Mixtures of two or more such bleaching compounds can also be used.<br>
Preferred peroxygen bleaching compounds include sodium perborate,<br>
commercially available in the form of mono-, tri-, and tetra-hydrate, sodium<br>
pyrophosphate peroxyhydrate, urea peroxyhydrate, sodium percarbonate, and<br>
sodium peroxide. Particularly preferred arc sodium perborate tetrahydrate, sodium<br>
perborate monohydrate and sodium percarbonate. Percarbonate is especially<br>
preferred.	<br>

0.01% to about 15%, preferably from about 1% to about 10%, more preferably from<br>
about 1% to about 8%, by weight of the composition. Preferred activators are<br>
selected from the group consisting of tetraacetyl ethylene diamin (TAED),<br>
benzoylcaprolactam	(BzCL),	4-nitrobenzoylcaprolactam,	3-<br>
chlorobenzoylcaprolactam,	bcnzoyloxybenzenesulphonate	(BOBS),<br>
nonanoyloxybenzenesulphonatc       (NOBS),       phcnyl       benzoate       (PliBz),<br><br>
decanoyloxybenzezesulphonate (C10-OBS), benzolyvalerolactam (BZVL), octanoyloxybenzenesulphonate (C8-OBS), perhydrolyzable esters and mixtures thereof, most preferably benzoylcaprolactam and benzolyvalerolactam, Particularly preferred bleach activators in the pH range from about 8 to about 9,5 are those selected having an OBS or VL leaving group.<br>
Preferred bleach activators are those described in U.S. Patent 5,130,045, Mitchell et al, and 4.412,934, Chung et al, and copending patent applications U. S, Serial Nos. 08/054,624, 08/064,623, 08/064,621, 08/064,562, 08/064,564, 08/082,270 and copending application to M. Bums, A. D. Willey, R. T. Hartshorn, C. K. Ghosh, entitled "Bleaching Compounds Comprising Peroxyacid Activators Used With Enzymes' and having U.S. Serial No. 08/133,691 (P&amp;G Case 4890R),. all of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The mole ratio of peroxygen bleaching compound (as AvO) to bleach activator in the present invention generally ranges from at least 1:1, preferably from about 20:1 to about 1:1, mere preferably from about 10:1 to about 3:1.<br>
Quaternary substituted bleach activators may also be included. The present detergent composition compositions comprise a quaternary substituted bleach activator (QSBA) or a quaternary substituted peracid (QSP); more preferably, the former. Preferred QSBA structures are further described in copending U.S. Serial No. 08/298,903, 08/298,650, 08/298,906 and 08/298,904 filed August 31, 1994, incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Diacyl Peroxide Bleaching Species<br>
The composite particles in accordance with the present invention may also comprise from about l% to about 50% by weight, more preferably from about 5% to about 40% by weight, most preferably from about 10% to about 35% by weight of the composite of discrete particles of water-insoluble diacyl peroxide. The individual diacyl peroxide particles in the composite have a mean particle size of less than about 300 microns, preferably less than about 200 microns, more preferably from about 1 to about 150 microns, most preferably from about 10 to about 100 microns.<br>
The diacyl peroxide is preferably a water-insoluble diacyl peroxide of the general formula:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein R and R1 can be the same or different, and each comprises a hydrocarbyl group containing more than ten carbon atoms. Preferably, at least one of these groups has an aromatic nucleus.<br><br>
Examples of suitable diacyl peroxides are those selected from the group consisting of dibenzoyl peroxide, benzoyl glutaryl peroxide, benzoyl succinyl peroxide. di-(2-methybenzoyl) peroxide, diphthaloyl peroxide and mixtures thereof, more preferably dibenzoyl peroxide, diphthaloyl peroxides and mixtures thereof. The preferred diacyl peroxide is dibenzoyl peroxide.<br>
The diacyl peroxide thermally decomposes under wash conditions (i.e. typically from about 38°C to about 71°C) to form free radicals. This occurs even when the diacyl peroxide particles are water-insoluble.<br>
Surprisingly, panicle size can play an important role in the performance of the diacyl peroxide, not only in preventing residue deposit problems, but also in enhancing the removal of stains, particularly from stained plasticware. The mean, particle size of the diacyl peroxide particles produced in wash solution after dissolution of the particle composite carrier material, as measured by a laser particle size analyzer (e.g. Malvem) on an agitated mixture with water of the diacyl peroxide, is less than about 300 microns, preferably less than about 200 microns. Although water insolubility is an essential characteristic of the diacyl peroxide used in the present invention, the size of the particles containing it is also important for controlling residue formation in the wash and maximizing stain removal performance.<br>
Preferred diacyl peroxides used in the present compositions are also formulated into a carrier material that melts within the range of from about 38°C to about 77°C, preferably selected from the group consisting of polyethylene glycols, paraffin waxes, and mixtures thereof, as taught in copending U.S. patent application Serial Number 08/424,132, filed April 17,1995.

Protease enzymes are usually present in such commercial preparations at levels sufficient to provide from 0,005 to 0.1 Anson units (AU) of activity per gram of composition. For certain detergents, such as in automatic dishwashing, it may be desirable to<br>
.4<br>
increase the active enzyme content of the commercial preparation in order to minimize the total amount of non-catalytically active materials and thereby improve spotting/filming or other end-results. Higher active levels may also be desirable in. highly concentrated detergent formulations.<br>

One stabilizing approach is the use of water-soluble sources of calcium and/or magnesium ions in the finished compositions which provide such ions :o the<br><br>
enzymes. Calcium ions are generally more effective than magnesium ions and are preferred herein if only one type of cation is being used. Typical detergent compositions, especially liquids, will comprise from about 1 to about 30, preferably from about 2 to about 20, more preferably from about 8 to about 12 millimoles of calcium ion per liter of finished detergent composition, though variation is possible depending on factors including the multiplicity, type and levels of enzymes incorporated. Preferably water-soluble calcium or magnesium salts are employed, including for example calcium chloride, calcium hydroxide, calcium formate, calcium makte, calcium maleate, calcium hydroxide and calcium acetate; more generally, calcium sulfate or magnesium salts corresponding to the exemplified calcium salts may be used. Further increased levels of Calcium and/or Magnesium. may of course be useful, for example for promoting the grease-cutting action of certain types of surfactant.<br>
Another stabilizing approach is by use of borate species. See Severson, U.S. 4,537,706. Borate stabilizers, when used, may be at levels of up to 10% or more of the composition though more typically, levels of up to about 3% by weight of boric acid or other borate compounds such as borax or orthoborate are suitable for liquid detergent use. Substituted boric acids such as phenylboronic acid, butaneboronic acid, p-bromophenylboronic acid or the like can be used in place of boric acid and reduced levels of total boron in detergent compositions may be possible though the use of such substituted boron derivatives,<br>
Stabilizing systems of certain cleaning compositions, for example automatic dishashing compositions, may further comprise from 0 to about 10%, preferably from about 0.01% to about 6% by weight, of chlorine bleach scavengers, added to prevent chlorine bleach species present in many water supplies from attacking and inactivating the enzymes, especially under alkaline conditions. While chlorine levels in water may be small, typically in the range from about 0.5 ppm to about 1.75 ppm, the available chlorine in the total volume of water that comes in contact with the enzyme, for example during dish- or fabric-washing, can be relatively large; accordingly, enzyme stability to chlorine in-use is sometimes problematic. Since perborate or percarbonate, which have the ability to react with chlorine bleach, may present in certain of the instant compositions in amounts accounted for separately from the stabilizing system, the use of additional stabilizers against chlorine, may, most generally, not be essential, though improved results may be obtainable from their use. Suitable chlorine scavenger anions are widely known and readily available, and, if used, can be salts containing ammonium cations with sulfite, bisulfite, thiosulfite, thiosulfate, iodide, etc. Antioxidants such as carbarmate,<br><br>
ascorbates etc., organic amines such as ethylenediaminetetracetic acid (EDTA) or alkali metal salt thereof, monoethanolamme (MEA), and mixtures thereof can likewise be used, Likewise, special enzyme inhibition systems can be incorporated such that different enzymes have maximum compatibility. Other conventional scavengers such as bisulfate, nitrate, chloride, sources of hydrogen peroxide such as sodium perborate tetrahydrate, sodium perborate monohydrate and sodium percarbonate, as well as phosphate, condensed phosphate, acetate, benzoate, citrate, formate, lactate, malate, tartrate, salicylare, etc., and mixtures thereof can be used if desired. In general, since the chlorine scavenger function can be performed by ingredients separately listed under better recognized functions, (e.g., hydrogen peroxide sources), there is no absolute requirement to add a separate chlorine, scavenger unless a compound performing that function to the desired extent is absent from an enzyme-containing embodiment of the invention; even then, the scavenger is added only for optimum results. Moreover, the formulator will exercise a chemist's normal skill in avoiding the use of any enzyme scavenger or stabilizer which is majorly incompatible, as formulated, with other reactive ingredients, if used. In relation to the use of ammonium salts, such salts can be simply admixed with the detergent composition but are prone to adsorb water and/or liberate ammonia during storage. Accordingly, such materials, if present, are desirably protected in a particle such as that described in US 4,652,392, Baginski et al.<br>
Silicone and Phosphate Ester Suds Suppressors<br>
The detergent compositions optionally contain an alkyl phosphate ester suds suppressor, a silicone suds suppressor, or combinations thereof. Levels in general are from 0% to about 10%, preferably, from about 0.001% to about 5%, Typical levels tend to be low, e.g., from about 0.01% to about 3% when a silicone suds suppressor is used. Preferred non-phosphate compositions omit the phosphate ester component entirely.<br>
Silicone suds suppressor technology and other defoaming agents useful herein are extensively documented in "Defoaming, Theory and Industrial Applications", Ed,, P. R. Garrett, Marcel Dekker, N.Y., 1973, ISBN 0-8247-8770-6, incorporated herein by reference. See especially the chapters entitled "Foam control in Detergent Products" (Ferch et al) and "Surfactant Antifoams" (Blease et al). See also U.S. Patents 3,933,672 and 4,136,045. Highly preferred silicone suds suppressors are the compounded types known for use in laundry detergents such as heavy-duty granules, although types hitherto used only in heavy-duty liquid detergents may also be incorporated in the instant compositions. For example, pclydimethylsiloxancs<br><br>
having trimethylsilyl or alternate endblocking units may be used as the silicons. These may be compounded with silica and/or with surface-active nonsilicon components, as illustrated by a suds suppressor comprising 12% silicone/ silica, 18% stearyl alcohol and 70% starch in granular form, A suitable commercial source of the silicone active compounds is Dow Coming Corp.<br>
Levels of the suds suppressor depend to some extent on the sudsing tendency of the composition, for example, an detergent composition for use at 2000 ppm comprising 2% octadecyldimethylamine oxide may not require the presence of a suds suppressor. Indeed, it is an advantage of the present invention to select cleaning-effective amine oxides which are inherently much lower in foam-forming tendencies than the typical coco amine oxides. In contrast, formulations in which t amine oxide is combined with a high-foaming anionic cosurfactant e.g.) alkyl ethoxy sulfate, benefit greatly from the presence of suds suppressors.<br>
Phosphate esters have also been asserted to provide some protection of silver and silver-plated utensil surfaces, however, the instant compositions can have excellent silvcrcare without a phosphate ester component. Without being limited by theory, it is believed that lower pH formulations, e.g., those having pH of 9.5 and below, plus the presence of the essential amine oxide, both contribute to improved silver care.<br>
If it is desired nonetheless to use a phosphate ester, suitable compounds are disclosed in U.S. Patent 3,314,891, issued April 18, 1967, to Schmolka et al, incorporated herein by reference. Preferred alkyl phosphate esters contain from 16-20 carbon atoms, Highly preferred alkyl phosphate esters are monostearyl acid phosphate or monooleyl acid phosphate, or salts thereof, particularly alkali metal salts, or mixtures thereof.<br>
It has been found preferable to avoid the use of simple calcium-precipitating soaps as antifoams in the present compositions as they tend to deposit on the dishware. Indeed, phosphate esters are not entirely free of such problems and the formulator will generally choose to minimize the content of potentially depositing antifoams in the instant compositions.<br>
Corrosion Inhibitor<br>
The detergent compositions may contain a corrosion inhibitor. Such corrosion inhibitors are preferred components of automatic dishwashing compositions in accord with the invention, and are preferably incorporated at a level of from 0,05% to 10%, preferably from 0.1% to 5% by weight of the total composition.<br><br>
Suitable corrosion inhibitors include paraffin oil typically a predominantly branched aliphatic hydrocarbon having a number of carbon atoms in the range of from 20 to 50: preferred paraffin oil selected from predominantly branched C25-45 species with a ratio of cyclic to noncyclic hydrocarbons of about 32:68; a paraffin oil meeting these characteristics is sold by Wintershall, Salzbergen, Germany, under the trade name WINOG 70.<br>
Other suitable corrosion inhibitor compounds include benzotriazole and any derivatives thereof, mercaptans and diols, especially mercaptans with 4 to 20 carbon atoms including lauryl mercantan, thiophenol, thionapthol, thionalide and thioanthranol, Also suitable are the C12-C20 fatty acids, or their salts, especially aluminum tristearate. The C^2-C20 hydroxy fatty acids, or their salts, are also suitable. Phosphonated octa-decane and other anti-oxidants such as betahydroxytoluene (BHT) are also suitable.<br>
Other  Optional Adjuncts<br>
Depending on whether a greater or lesser degree of compactness is required, filler materials can also be present in the detergent compositions, These include sucrose, sucrose esters, sodium chloride, sodium sulfate, potassium chloride, potassium sulfate, etc., in amounts up to about 70%, preferably from 0% to about 40% of the detergent composition composition. A preferred filler is sodium sulfate, especially in good grades having at most low levels of trace impurities.<br>
Sodium sulfate used herein preferably has a purity sufficient to ensure it is non-reactive with bleach; it may also be treated with low levels of sequestrants, such as phosphonates in magnesium-salt form. Note that preferences, in terms of purity sufficient to avoid decomposing bleach, applies also to builder ingredients.<br>
Hydrotrope materials such as sodium benzene sulfonate, sodium toluene sulfonate, sodium cumene sulfonate, etc., can be present in minor amounts.<br>
Bleach-stable perfumes (stable as to odor); and bleach-stable dyes (such as those disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,714,562, Roselle et al, issued December 22,1987); can also be added to the present compositions in appropriate amounts. Other common detergent ingredients are not excluded.<br>
Since certain detergent compositions herein can contain water-sensitive ingredients, e.g., in embodiments comprising anhydrous amine oxides or anhydrous citric acid, it is desirable to keep the free moisture content of the detergent compositions at a minimum, e.g., 7% or less, preferably 4% or less of the detergent composition; and to provide packaging which is substantially impermeable to water and carbon dioxide. Plastic bottles, including refillable or recyclable types, as well<br><br>
as conventional barrier cartons or boxes are generally suitable. When ingredients are not highly compatible, e.g., mixtures of silicates and citric acid, it may further be desirable to coat at least one such ingredient with a low-foaming nonionic surfactant for protection. There are numerous waxy materials which can readily be used to form suitable coated particles of any such otherwise incompatible components,<br>
Method for Cleaning<br>
The detergent compostions herein may be utilized in methods for cleaning soiled tableware. A preferred method comprises contacting the tableware with a pH wash aqueous medium of at least 8. The aqueous medium comprises at least about 0,1 ppm bleach catalyst and available oxygen from a peroxygen bleach. The bleach, catalyst is added in the form of the particles described herein,<br>
A preferred method for cleaning soiled tableware comprises using the bleach catalyst-containing panicles, enzyme, low foaming surfactant and detergency builder. The aqueous medium is formed by dissolving a solid-form automatic dishwashing detergent in an automatic dishwashing machine. A particularly preferred method also includes low levels of silicate, preferably from about 3% to about 10%Si02-<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
The following examples are illustrative of the present invention. These examples are not meant to limit or otherwise define the scope of the invention. All parts, percentages and ratios used herein are expressed as percent weight unless otherwise specified,<br>
EXAMPLE1<br>
Flakes containing both discrete particles of cobalt catalyst (e.g., Pentaammineacetatocobali(III) Nitrate, herein "PAC", prepared as described hereinbefore) and PEG 8000 as a carrier are made as follows, b accordance with the present invention:<br>
960 grams of polyethylene glycol of molecular weight 8000 (PEG 8000, sold by BASF as Pluracol E-8000 prills) are placed in a half-gallon plastic tub acd heated in a microwave on a high setting for 1 minutes to melt the PEG 8000. The PEG is stirred to ensure uniform consistency and complete melting. The final temperature of the molten PEG 8000 is 61°C (1428F).<br>
40 grams of cobalt catalyst [pentaammineaceiatocobalt(III) nitrate, prepared as described hereinbefore] are added slowly to the molten PEG 8000. This mixture<br><br>
is stirred with a spatula for 3 minute to uniformly disperse the powder in the molten PEG.<br>
Immediately, the entire mixture is poured into the nip of a twin drum chill roll. The settings on the chill roll are as follows;<br>
Gap:	.015mm<br>
Speed:	50 rpm<br>
Water Temperature;	13°C (55°F) (cold water from the tap)<br>
Flakes are formed on the chill roil and scraped off by use of a doctor blade into a pan and collected.<br>
The flakes are then reduced in size by use of a Quadro Co-mil, which is a form<br>
of cone mill, with z screen having a 0.039 inch (1 mm) hole openings. The reduced 
size flakes are then sieved in 200 gram portions using a Tyler 28 mesh, a Tyler 65<br>
mesh, and a pan in a Rotap. The portion which passes through the Tyler 28 mesh<br>
but is retained on the Tyler 65 mesh is collected as acceptable flakes,<br>
The composition of the resultant flake is:<br>
PEG 8000	96%<br>
Cobalt Catalyst	4%<br>
A similar process may be used starting with PEG 4000 in place of the PEG 8000 to obtain PEG 4000/cobalt catalyst particles (96%/4%).<br>
A similar process using 800 grams PEG 8000,120 grams sodium sulfate, and<br>
80 grams cobalt catalyst produces a flake particle having:<br>
PEG 8000	80%<br>
Cobalt Catalyst	8%<br>
Sodium Sulfate	12%.<br>
