				<td>HELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to a method for conducting service on a wind turbine after the wind<br>
turbine is erected and after the hub of the wind turbine is mounted on the main shaft of<br>
the wind turbine. The invention also relates to equipment for conducting such service and<br>
furthermore the invention relates to a connecting piece and a crane constituting part of the<br>
equipment. Finally, the invention relates to a wind turbine, to a hub and to uses of a hub.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Although much of the appliances installed in a wind turbine is intended for lasting a very<br>
long time, some of the appliances must be replaced or must be repaired during the service<br>
life of the wind turbine. Equipment installed in the nacelle or in the tower of the wind<br>
turbine may be removed from or lifted to the nacelle by means of cranes or other lifting<br>
means provided on or in connection with the nacelle. The tower and the machine frame of<br>
the nacelle are solid structures where even large cranes may be secured to and where<br>
even heavy appliances may be lowered from or lifted to without any difficulties. However,<br>
appliances installed in the hub, in connection with the wings or in connection with the hub<br>
may be more difficult to access and to handle for possible removal in order for the<br>
appliances to be replaced or be repaired at a more suited location than the service location<br>
of the appliances. Often, a hatch is provided in the top of the nacelle housing, enabling<br>
access from or to the outside of the hub and from or to the nacelle and further down or up<br>
through the tower. This manner, in which appliances at the more remote locations<br>
mentioned Is handled, is a secure manner, but also quite time-consuming. Also, during<br>
handling through the hatch of the nacelle housing, the escape way from the remote<br>
locations is blocked, endangering the working conditions at these remote locations.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It may be an object of the present invention to provide a method and equipment to be<br>
used by the method, and which does not posses the above-mentioned disadvantages.<br><br><br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides an equipment for servicing a wind turbine after a<br>
hub of the wind turbine has been mounted, said equipment comprising a crane for lowering and<br>
hoisting wind turbine appliances from and to the hub, characterized in that connecting means<br>
are provided for primarily securing the equipment including the crane to a curved surface of the<br>
hub, and receiving the load of the crane thereon, the connecting means having a lower surface<br>
adapted to conform to the hub curved surface.<br>
This object is obtained by a method comprising mounting of servicing equipment on the hub of<br>
the wind turbine and lowering and hoisting wind turbine appliances from and to the hub.<br>
Thereby, it is possible to lower from and to lift to the hub, the appliances which is to be<br>
replaced or repaired without using the hatch constituting the escape way and without having to<br>
transfer the appliances through the nacelle and along the tower.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the servicing equipment is mounted to the outside surface of the hub,<br>
and where the equipment to be lowered from and hoisted to the hub is lowered and hoisted to<br>
the hub at a front of the hub. Even more preferred, the servicing equipment is mounted by<br>
means of already available holes, said holes formerly used for hoisting the hub to the main shaft<br>
of the wind turbine.<br>
By securing the servicing equipment to the surface of the hub and by furthermore utilising<br>
already available holes, it is very easy and fast to erect the servicing equipment and possible to<br>
lower or to hoist any equipment from the hub, the blades or the spinner without having to access<br>
the interior of the hub, i.e. all the already limited space inside the hub will not be occupied by<br>
the servicing equipment according to the invention.<br>
The present invention also provides a method of conducting service on a wind turbine, the<br>
method involving the mounting of the equipment onto the curved surface of the wind turbine<br>
hub by securing the connecting means to the hub curved surface, and employing the crane to<br>
lower and hoist wind turbine appliances from and to the hub.<br><br>
Accordingly, the object of the invention is also obtained by equipment being provided with<br>
means for primarily securing the equipment to the hub opposite from securing the<br>
equipment to the nacelle or other parts, different from the hub, of the wind turbine.<br>
The previously mentioned advantages, which are obtained by the method according to the<br>
invention, are fulfilled by means of the equipment according to the invention. Securing the<br>
equipment primarily to the hub avoids obstructing the hatch in the top of the nacelle, and<br>
makes it possible easily to handle appliances to. and from the hub, the blades and the hub.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
 Fig. 1 shows how equipment to be used, when conducting service on the wind turbine, is<br>
placed, when the equipment is mounted on a hub 1. The hub 1 is mounted to the main<br>
shaft 2 of the wind turbine, and the main shaft 2 extends from the nacelle 3 of the wind<br>
turbine. The hub 1 is provided with an outer cap called the spinner 4, which, for the sake<br>
of clarity, in the figure is partly cut away in order to show the mounting of the equipment<br>
on the hub.<br>
The equipment comprises different main parts. Primarily, a first connecting piece 5 and a<br>
seeond connecting piece 6 is secured to the surface 7 of the hub 1. The remaining parts of<br>
the equipment are secured to the connecting pieces so that all of the equipment via the<br>
two coupling elements is secured to the hub. The remaining parts of the equipment<br>
comprise a crane 8, a gangway 9 with guard rails 10, a ladder 11 leading from the nacelle<br>
3 to the gangway 9 and a curb 12 mounted foremost on the hub 1 end being suspended<br>
from the crane 8. The crane 8 is secured to the first connecting piece 5, and the gangway<br>
9 is secured to the crane 8 and to the second connecting piece 6.<br>
In the embodiment shown, the crane 8 is hoisting a hydraulic actuator 13 up to the hub 1<br>
for replacement or for re-installation after formerly having been hoisted down for repair.<br>
Such hydraulic actuator 13 may weigh up to 250 kg. The entire torque from the equipment<br>
on the first connecting piece 5 must be absorbed by the securing of the first connecting<br>
piece 5 to the surface 7 of the hub. 1. This sets extremely high demands to the securing of<br>
the first connecting piece 5 to the hub 1. That is why persons skilled in the art have come<br>
to the conclusions that it is hot possible.<br>
Fig. 2 is a perspective view of the first connecting piece 5 and the second connecting piece<br>
6, when secured to the surface 7 of the hub 1. The first connecting piece 5 consists of a<br><br><br>
substantially cylindrical element, and the second connecting piece 6 consists of a plate-like<br>
element. In the embodiments shown, both the first connecting piece 5 and the second<br>
connecting piece 6 are secured to the surface 7 of the hub 1 in already existing and<br>
available mounting holes (not shown). The already existing and available holes are holes,<br>
which formerly have been used during erection and assembly of the wind turbine, when<br>
hoisting, by means of a mobile crane or raft-mounted crane, the hub from the ground to<br>
the main shaft and maintaining the hub in place during bolting of the hub to the main<br>
shaft. Thus, the holes for securing the first connecting piece and the second connecting<br>
piece to the surface of the hub are not initially provided for that purpose.<br>
Fig. 3 and fig. 4 are plane drawings, fig. 5 is a perspective plane view and fig. 6 is a<br>
perspective cross sectional view, all showing the first connecting piece 5, when being<br>
secured to the surface 7 of the hub 1. As can be seen, the surface 7 of the hub 1 is curved<br>
in the plane of the figure. Thus, the first connecting piece 5 must be able to adapt to the<br>
curvature of the surface 7 of the hub 1 in order to obtain a proper securing of the first<br>
connecting piece 5 to the hub. Only by achieving a proper securing will the first connecting<br>
piece 5 be able to hold the crane 8, even when the crane is lifting heavy appliances to the<br>
hub such as hydraulic actuators to be mounted inside the hub.<br>
The first connecting piece 5 is provided with means for passing five bolts 14 through the<br>
connecting piece 5 from a top of the connecting piece 5 and to the threaded holes 15<br>
already provided and available in the surface 7 of the hub 1. The bolts 14 extend through<br>
guiding liners 16 inside the first connecting piece 5, the guiding liners 16 extending from<br>
an upper internal disc-like structure 17 to a lower disc-like structure 18 and through the<br>
lower disc-like structure 18 into a bottom cavity 19 of the first connecting piece 5. The<br>
bottom cavity 19 is delimited by the lower disc-like structure 18 and by a lower flange 20<br>
of the first connecting piece 5.<br>
The bottom cavity 19 is intended for taking up of a cement-like substance (not shown)<br>
creating a physical connection between an under-side 21 of the lower disc-like structure 18<br>
and the surface 7 of the hub 1. The cement-like substance is intended for creating a<br>
completely homogeneous connection between the surface 7 of the hub 1 and the first<br>
connecting piece 5. Because the surface 7 of the hub 1 is not worked more than absolutely<br>
necessary, when being manufactured, the surface 7 of the hub 1 is somewhat rough. If<br>
perhaps the first connecting piece had a concave surface being made of metal like the<br>
connecting piece itself and being congruent with the convex surface of the hub, the<br>
abutment between the concave surface of the first connecting piece and the convex<br>
surface of the hub would not be homogeneous, because of the rough surface of the hub.<br><br><br>
However, introducing a cement-like substance into the cavity 19 made in the very bottom<br>
of the first connecting piece 5, the cement-like substance will fill out any unevenness of<br>
the rough surface 7 of the hub 1 and will also fill out the entire cavity 19 in the bottom of<br>
the first connecting piece 5. Thus, a complete congruent and homogenous abutment will<br>
be established between the underside 21 of the lower disc-like structure 18 and the<br>
surface 7 of the hub 1. This complete congruent and homogenous abutment is necessary<br>
in order for the first connecting piece to be able to carry the loads lowered or hoisted by<br>
the crane, without the risk of the crane tilting and breaking loose from the surface of the<br>
hub together with the first connecting piece. Preferred cement-like substances are<br>
 substances from the Danish company Densit A/S, said substances being very hard and<br>
durable, although being workable when yet not cured.<br>
Fitting of the first connecting piece 5 to the surface 7 of the hub 1 takes place by initially<br>
inserting a threaded end-of the bolts 14 into the already available holes 15 in the surface 7<br>
 of the hub 1. The holes 15, as mentioned, are previously being made, when manufacturing<br>
the hub, and is, until now, only intended for hoisting, by means of a large crane, the hub<br>
from the ground to the mounting flange of the main shaft.<br>
Subsequently to the insertion of the bolts 14 into the already available holes 15, the bolts<br>
14 are fastened or nuts 22, as shown, at threaded other ends of the bolts 14 are fitted and<br>
fastened. Because the number of bolts 14 are limited to the number of already available<br>
holes 15, and because the holes 15, and thus the bolts 14, are situated quite close, the<br>
bolts 14 or the nuts 22 must befastened quite much in order for the crane 8 to be able to<br>
hoist the sometimes heavy appliances to the hub 1. Eventually, the bolts 14 or nuts 22 are<br>
fastened up to 50% of the yield point of the bolts. Depending on the size of the already<br>
available holes 15, the bolts 14 may have different sizes, however a typical size being M30<br>
bolts, i.e. having a diameter of 30 mm.<br>
Alternatively to providing a congruent and homogeneous abutment between the often<br>
rather rough surface of the hub and the first connecting piece, the surface of the hub, onto<br>
which the first connecting piece is to be mounted, may be worked so that a smoother<br>
surface is established. This may establish the possibility of a bottom surface of the first<br>
connecting piece being a machined surface, being concave and being the abutment surface<br>
towards the surface of the hub in stead of a cement-like substance.<br>
A flange 23 on the outer circumference of the first connecting piece 5 is provided with<br>
threaded holes 24 for securing by bolts (not shown) of the crane 8 to the first connecting<br>
piece 5. Therefore, a corresponding flange is provided on the crane (see fig. 7).<br><br><br>
The bottom flange 20 assisting in the establishment of the cavity 19 for the cement-like<br>
substance is provided with small bolts 25 extending through threaded holes (not shown) in<br>
the bottom flange 20. Because the bottom flange 20 is inclined an angle a, as shown, the<br>
bolts 25 are also inclined as shown, i.e. with the end of the blots extending into the cavity<br>
19 and directed towards the bottom of the first connecting piece and towards the surface 7<br>
of the hub 1.<br>
The bolts 25 are not intended for further securing of the first connecting piece 5 to the<br>
surface 7 of the hub 1. The bolts 25 are intended for being tightened and thus being urged<br>
into the cavity 19. Because the end of the bolts extending into the cavity are inclined<br>
towards the bottom of the first connecting piece and towards the surface 7 of the hub 1,<br>
then, when tightening the bolts, the end of the bolts at one time during the tightening will<br>
meet the surface 7 of the hub 1. Further tightening of the bolts 25 will cause the first<br>
connecting piece 5 to raise itself from the surface 7 of the hub 1 and free the first<br>
connecting piece 5 from the hub 1, if the bolts 14 initially are loosened. This technique is<br>
used, when the first connecting piece 5 has been used for supporting the crane 8 and no.<br>
longer is to be used, but has to be freed from the surface 7 of the hub 1 so that the wind<br>
turbine can come into operation again.<br>
Fig. 7 is a perspective view and fig. 8, fig. 9 and fig. 10 are plane views of a crane 8<br>
according to the invention. The crane 8 has a mast 30 and a jib 31, the jib 31 being<br>
connected to the mast 30 by a hinged connection 32. The mast 30 has a flange 33<br>
intended for being secured to the flange 23 of the first connecting piece 5. A plurality of<br>
bolts 34 is provided for securing the crane 8 to the first connecting piece 5.<br>
Above the flange 33 along the mast 30, four studs 35 extend outwards from the mast 30<br>
on opposite sides of the mast 30. The studs 35 are intended for carrying the front-most<br>
part of the gangway (see fig. 1). Preferably, the studs 35 are made of a material lighter<br>
than steel such as an aluminium alloy in order to reduce the overall weight of the crane 8.<br>
A preferred alloy is Alumec from Uddeholm Tooling having a module of elasticity being<br>
about 1/3 that of steel, but has rigidity being about the same as for steel. The studs 35 are<br>
mounted in bushings 36 provided in the mast 30. Thus, in the embodiment shown, the<br>
studs 35 consist of four studs in total extending trough the bushings 36 in the mast 30 and<br>
projecting on each side of the mast 30.<br>
An. upper link 37 and a lower link 38 are provided between the mast 30 and the hinged<br>
connection 32. Thus, the hinged connection 32 is provided at an outmost end of the links<br>
37,38. The links 37.38 are made from a material being: very light in order to reduce the<br>
overall weight of the crane 8. The links 37,38 have a shape, resulting in the links 37.38<br><br><br>
converging from a greater dimension at the mast 30 of the crane 8 to a smaller dimension<br>
at the hinged connection 32. In a preferred embodiment, the links are also made of a<br>
material being lighter than steel such as an aluminium alloy, preferably Aiumec from<br>
Uddeholm Tooling having, as mentioned, a module of elasticity being about 1/3 that of<br>
steel, but having rigidity being equal to that of steel. Thus, the strength of the links is not<br>
compromised.<br>
. The jib 31 is made of a material being rigid enough to carry the load to be hoisted, but still<br>
being as light-weighted as possible in order to reduce the overall weight of the crane 8 and<br>
especially the weight contributing much to the torque applied to the first connecting piece.<br>
 In a preferred embodiment the jib 31 is made of Alumec from Uddeholm Tooling. Between<br>
 the lower link 38 and the jib 31 a hydraulic actuator 39 is provided. The hydraulic actuator<br>
 39 is intended for swivelling the jib 31 around the hinged connection 32 in relation to the<br>
links 37,38 and in relation to the mast 30 and the hub 1, onto which the crane 8 is<br>
mounted.<br>
From an upper part of the hinged connection 32 and obliquely downward to an out-most<br>
end, although not outer-most end, of the jib 31, a brace 40 is inserted. The jib 31 is a so-<br>
called IPE-profile, and the lowering and hoisting means consists of a trolley 41 with a wire<br>
42. The trolley 41 preferably has a set of two or more wheels 43 on each side of the jib 31.<br>
Thereby, the trolley 41 has the advantage of distributing the load along the length of the<br>
jib 31. Thereby, the jib 31 may be made using as little material as possible in relation to<br>
the weight to be lowered and hoisted by the wire 42 and thus in consideration of the total<br>
weight of the jib 31 and the crane 8. In the embodiment shown, the outer-most point of<br>
the jib is situated in a distance from the crane mast centre of about 2.5m.<br><br>
