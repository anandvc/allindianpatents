PIPERAZINE DERIVATIVES USEFUL AS CCR5 AhTTAGONISTS<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
The present invention relates to piperazine derivatives useful as selective CCR5 antagonists, pharmaceutical compositions containing the compounds, and methods of treatment using the compounds. The invention also relates to the use of a combination of a CCR5 antagonist of this invention and one or more antiviral or other agents useful in the treatment of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). The invention further relates to the use of a CCR-5 antagonist of this invention, alone or in combination with another agent, in the treatment of solid organ transplant rejection, graft v, host disease, arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, asthma, allergies or multiple sclerosis.<br>
The global health crisis caused by HIV, the causative agent of Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS), is unquestioned, and while recent advances in drug therapies have been successful in stowing the progression of AIDS, there is still a need to find a safer, more efficient, less expensive way to control the virus.<br>
It has been reported that the CCR5 gene plays a role in resistance to HIV infection. HIV infection begins by attachment of the virus to a target cell membrane through interaction with the cellular receptor CD4 and a secondary chemokine co-receptor molecule, and proceeds by replication and dissemination of infected cells through the blood and other tissue. There are various chemokine receptors, but for macrophage-tropic HIV, believed to be the key pathogenic strain that replicates In vivo in the early stages of infection, the principal chemokine receptor required for the entry of HIV into the cell is CCR5. Therefore, interfering with the interaction between the viral receptor CCR5 and HIV can block HIV entry into the cell.<br><br>
The present invention relates to small molecules which are CCR5 antagonists.<br>
CCR-5 receptors have been reported to mediate cell transfer in inflammatory diseases such as arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, asthma and allergies, and inhibitors of such receptors are expected to be useful in the treatment of such diseases, and in the treatment of other inflammatory diseases or conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease, multiple sclerosis, solid organ transplant rejection and graft v. host disease.<br>
Related piperazine derivatives which are muscarinic antagonists useful in the treatment of cognitive disorders such as Alzheimer's disease are disclosed in US patents 5,883,096; 6,037,352; 5,889,006.<br>
A-M. Vandamme et al., Antiviral Chemistn/ &amp; Chemotherapy. 9:187-203 (1998) disclose current clinical treatments of HlV-1 infections in man including at least triple drug combinations or so-called Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy ("HAART'); HAART involves various combinations of nucleoside reverse transcriptase Inhibitors ("NRTI"), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors ("NNRTI") and HIV protease inhibitors ("PI"). In compliant drug-naive patients, HAART is effective in reducing mortality and progression of HIV-1 to AIDS. However, these multidrug therapies do not eliminate HIV-1 and long-term treatment usually results in multidrug resistance. Development of new drug therapies to provide better HIV-1 treatment remains a priority.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
As used herein, the following terms are used as defined below unless otherwise indicated.<br>
Alkyl represents straight and branched carbon chains and contains from one to six carbon atoms.<br>
Alkenyl represents Ca-Ce carbon chains having one or two<br>
unsaturated bonds, provided that two unsaturated bonds are not adjacent to each other.<br>
Substituted phenyl means that the phenyl group can be substituted at any available position on the phenyl ring.<br>
Acyl means a radical of a carboxylic acid having the formula alkyl-C(O)-, aryl-C(O)-, aralkyl-C(O)-, (C3'C7)cycloalkyl-C(0)-, (C3-C7)cycloalkyl-(Ci-C6)alkyl-C(0)-, and heteroaryl-C(O)-, wherein alkyl and<br>
heteroaryl are as defined herein; aryl is R'^'^-phenyl or R^'^-naphthyl; and aralkyi is aryl-(CrC6)alkyl, wherein aryl is as defined above.<br>
Heteroaryl represents cyclic aromatic groups of 5 or 6 atoms or bicyclic groups of 11 to 12 atoms having 1 or 2 heteroatoms independently selected from O, S or N, said heteroatom(3) interrupting a carbocyclic ring<br><br>
structure and having a sufficient number of delocalized pi electrons to provide aromatic character, provided that the rings do not contain adjacent oxygen and/or sulfur atoms. For 6-membered heteroaryl rings, carbon atoms can be substituted by R^, R*"^ or R^^ groups. Nitrogen atoms can form an N-oxide. All regioisomers are contemplated, e.g., 2-pyridyl, 3-pyhdyl and 4-pyridyl. Typical 6-membered heteroaryl groups are pyridyt, pyrimidinyl, pyrazinyl, pyridazinyl and the N-oxides thereof. For 5-membered heteroaryl rings, carbon atoms can be substituted by R'^^ or Ri3 groups. Typical 5-membered heteroaryl rings are furyl, thienyl, pyrrolyl, thiazolyl, isothiazolyl, imidazolyl, pyrazolyl and isoxazolyl. 5-Membered rings having one heteroatom can be joined through the 2- or 3- position; 5-membered rings having two heteroatoms are preferably joined through the 4-position. Bicyclic groups typically are benzo-fused ring systems derived from the heteroaryl groups named above, e.g. quinolyl, phthalazinyl, quinazolinyl, benzofuranyl, benzothienyl and indolyl.<br>
Preferred points of substitution for6-membered heteroaryl rings at R2 are described above. When R^ is a 5-membered heteroaryl group, the R"'^ and R"^^ substituents are preferably attached to carbon ring members adjacent to the carbon joining the ring to the rest of the molecule, and R^2 is preferably alkyl; however, if a heteroatom is adjacent to the carbon joining the ring to the rest of the molecule (i,e., as in 2-pyrrolyI), R^^ is preferably attached to a carbon ring member adjacent to the carbon joining the ring to the rest of the molecule.<br>
Halogen represents fluoro, chloro, bromo and iodo.<br>
One or more, preferaby one to four, antiviral agents useful in anti-HIV-1 therapy may be used in combination with a CCR5 antagonist of the present invention. The antiviral agent or agents may be combined with the CCR5 antagonist in a single dosage form, or the CCR5 antagonist and the antiviral agent or agents may be administered simultaneously or sequentially as separate dosage forms.

In Scheme 1, a benzylamine (1), wherein R and R^ are as defined above and R^ is hydrogen, is converted via (2) and (3) to the diketopiperazine (4), wherein R'* is as defined above, which is reduced to the piperazine (5). Depending upon the desired R  substituent, this is processed in two ways. Reductive amination gives (6), which can be deprotected to (7) and finally acylated to the compounds of formula lA wherein R^ and R  are H; alternatively, a modified Strecker reaction on (5) gives the aminonitrile (8), which, after treatment with methyl Grignard to give (9), deprotection to (10) and final N^acylation affords the compounds of formula IB wherein R5 is H and R^ is methyl. Acylation of (7) and (10) is carried out under standard conditions, e.g., with a compound R^COOH and reagents such as DEC and HOBT. Use of a chiral compound of formula 1, e.g., (S)-methyl 4-substituted benzylamine, and a chiral lactate in step a, e.g., methyl (R)-lactate triflate, will result in chiral compounds of formulas lA and IB.<br><br><br>

step 1: A solution of 4-trifluoromethyl acetophenone (1.88 g; 10 mmol) in<br>
dry THF (10 ml) was cooled in an ice bath and treated with freshly prepared<br>
solid (S)-2-methyl oxaborolidine (0.54g; 2 mmol). After 10 min., a solution<br>
of 2M borane-methyl sulfide complex (3 ml; 6 mmol) in THF was added<br>
dropwise over 5 min. TLC at the end of 30 min. showed that the starting<br>
material had been converted to a more polar product. The reaction was quenched with about 5 ml of CH3OH carefully until effervescence stopped;<br>
volatiles were removed in vacuo. The residue was dissolved in CH2CI2 and washed with IN HCI. water, 10% NaHCOa solution and brine. Concentration in vacuo gave 2g of a yellow gum. Flash silica gel chromatography (FSGC) using 10-20% EtOAc in hexanes furnished the desired chiral alcohol (1.6 g; 84%) as a colorless oil. TLC Rf = 0.6 in 25% EtOAc:hexanes.<br>
Step 2: To a solution of the product of step 1(1.55g; 8.16 mmol) in 10 ml of CH2CI2 cooled in an ice bath were added Bi^N (2.3 ml; 16.32 mmol) and CH3SO2CI (0.87 ml; 10.6 mmol) to form a turbid white solution. The<br>
reaction was quenched with water and the organic product was extracted with CH2CI2, washing with water, IN HCI, 10% NaHC03 solution and brine.<br>
Concentration in vacuo gave the chiral mesylate (2.1 g; 96%) as a pale yellow oil. TLC Rf = 0.6 in 25% EtOAc:hexanes.<br>
Step 3:   A solution of the product of step 2 (2.1g; 7.8 mmol), the N-BOC<br>
protected 2(S)-methyl piperazine (1.56g; 7.8 mmol - prepared from the<br>
reaction of commercial 2(S)-methyl piperazine with N-(tert-butoxy-<br>
carbonyioxy)phthalimide) and 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl piperidine (1.34 mi; 8 mmol) in 14 ml of dry CN3CN were heated at reflux until TLC indicated<br>
complete disappearance of the mesylate (16 h). The reaction mixture was cooled to RT, diluted with CH2CI2 (50 ml) and washed with water (3 x 100<br><br>
ml) and brine. The organic extract was dried over solid MgS04 and then concentrated to obtain 2.8 g of a yellow gum. FSGC (20% EtOAc in hexanes) sen/ed to isolate the desired (S,S)-diastereomer (1,5g; 52%) and its benzylic epimer, the (R,S)-diastereomer (0.5g; 17%) for a combined 69% yield. TLC Rf = 0.75 (S,S) and 0.56 (R,S) in 25% EtOAc:hexanes.<br>
Step 4: TFA (6 ml) was added to a solution of the product of step 3 in 12 ml of CH2CI2 and the resulting yellow-orange solution was stirred at RT for<br>
8 h. The reaction was quenched by adding IN NaOH solution to adjust the pHtolO.  Extractive work up in CH2CI2 gave 1.1 g of a yellow syrup. FSGC using 10% CH3OH in CH2CI2 removed the less polar impurity and gradient elution with 1% EtsN in 10% CH30H:CH2Cl2 was needed to etute the desired free amine of the (S,S) diastereomer. Yield = 0.9g (75%). TLC Rf = 0.5 in 10% CH30H:CH2Cl2.<br>
Step 5: A colorless solution of the product of step 4 (0.9g; 3.3 mmol), 4-piperidinone (0,86g; 4.3 mmol), NaB(0Ac)3H (1.05g; 4.95 mmol) and glacial AcOH (80 |al) in 8 ml of CH2CI2 was stirred at ambient temperature<br>
for a day. TLC indicated absence of starting material. The reaction mixture was diluted with 50 ml of CH2CI2, washed with IN NaOH solution, water (2 x) and brine. The CH2CI2 extract was dried over anhydrous MgS04 and<br>
concentrated to obtain 1.7g of yellow oil. FSGC (25% acetone in hexanes) was used to isolate the pure product (1.3g; 86%) as a white foam. TLC Rf<br>
= 0.6 in 25% acetone/hexanes.<br>
Step 6: TFA (5 ml) was added to a solution of the product of step 5 (1.3g;<br>
2.87 mmol) in CH2CI2 (10 ml) and the resulting yellow orange solution was<br>
stirrred at RT for 7 h. The reaction was quenched with 1N NaOH solution and the pH was adjusted to 10. The organic product was extracted into 50 ml of CH2CI2 and washed with water, then bhne and dried over MgS04. Concentration gave the free amine (0.98g; 98%) as a yellow syrup. TLC Rf = 0.1 in 25% acetone/hexanes.<br>
Step 7: The product of step 6 (0.78g; 2.21 mmol), DEC (0.65g; 3.4 mmol), HOST (0,46g; 3.4 mmol) and 2-amino-6-chloro benzoic acid (0.51 g; 2.9 mmol) were dissolved in 8 ml of CH2CI2 to which was added<br>
diisopropylethyl amine (0.7 ml) and the mixture was stirred at ambient temperature for 16h. TLC analysis showed absence of starting material and formation of two over-lapping spots of medium polarity (rotomers of the hindered amide) as the major product. The crude product (1.3g) was isolated by extractive work up and purified through FSGC using 25%<br><br>
acetone in CH2CI2 as eluant to give the title compound (0.88g; 80%) as a pale yellow foam. TLC Rt = 0.45 and 0,5 in 25% acetoneiCHaCIa-<br>
A solution of hydrogen chloride in Et20 (1fv1; 3 ml) was added to a solution of the title compound free base (0.76g; 1.54 mmol) in CH2CI2 (5ml) to obtain an instantaneous white precipitate. After stirring at RT for 2 h, the vojatiles were removed on a rotary evaporator and the white residue was suspended in dry toluene (3x10 ml) and azeotroped. The white solid thus obtained was suspended in dry Et20 containing 10% EtOAc, stirred for 30 min, filtered and washed with Et20 (100 ml). The HCI salt of the title compound was dried under high vacuum to yield an off-white solid (0,88g; 95%). Mp: 205-210^ C.<br>

FSGC, eluting the major product away from more polar impurities using a 1:1 mixture of CH2Cl2:EtOAc. The ipso-methyl compound was isolated as<br>
ayellowgum (1,85g; 88%). TLC Rf = 0,5 in 1:1 Et20:hexanes.<br>
Step 3: TFA (6 ml) was added to a solution of the product of step 2 (1.5g; 3.2 mmol) in 10 ml of CH2CI2 and stirred at 25^ C for 2 h. The reaction was<br>
quenched with IN NaOH solution to a pH of 9-10 and processed by extraction into CH2CI2 to obtain 1.2 g of crude product. FSGC using 1:1 CH2Cl2:EtOAc removed all the less polar impurities and gradient elution with 10% CH3OH in CH2CI2 and finally with 10% (ca. 7N-NH3) CH3OH in CH2CI2 led to the isolation of the free piperidine as a yellow gum (1.07g; 90%). TLC Rt = 0,2 in 10% CH30H:CH2Cl2.<br>
Step 4:   A solution of the product of step 3 (1.03g; 2.8 mmol), 2,4-dimethyl nicotinic acid (0.42g; 2.8 mmol), DEC (0.8g; 4.2 mmol). HOBT (0.57g; 4.2 mmol) and diisopropyl ethyl amine (1ml; 5.6 mmol) in CH2CI2 (15 ml) was stirred at 25^" C for 24 h. The reaction mixture was diluted with CH2CI2 (25 ml), washed with water, 10% NaHC03 solution and brine, then<br>
concentrated to obtain 1.6g of crude oil. FSGC of this material using gradient elution with 10% acetone-CH2Cl2 followed by 2-5% CH3OH in CH2CI2 gave the title compound (1 <lg as a white foam. tlc r in ch3oh-ch2ci2.></lg><br>
The free base of the title compound (1g; 2 mmol) isolated above was dissolved in a 1:1 mixture of EtOAc:Et20 (8 ml) and a fresh solution of hydrogen chloride in EtaO (6.1 ml of a 1M solution) was added, instantly<br>
forming a white precipitate. After stirring at 25° C for 1h. the volatiles were removed in vacuo. The product was suspended in Et20 and filtered,<br>

A solution of NaCIOj (6.89 g), NaH^PO, monohydrate (8.17 g) and water (45 ml) was added dropwise to the first solution. After complete addition, the pH was adjusted to 3 and two layers resulted. The organic layer was removed and evaporated to give intermediate acid (1.80 g) as a white crystalline solid, which was used without purification.<br>
Step 2: To a solution of the product of Step 1 (0.62 g), CH^CI^ (5 ml) and DMF (1 drop) was added oxalyl chloride (0.31 ml) and the resulting solution was stirred for 10 min, at which time a second portion of oxalyl chloride (0.30 ml) was added. The reaction was stirred for 10 min, toluene was added and the mixture was evaporated to dryness. CH^CI^ (10 ml) and EtNHj (1 ml) were added and the reaction was stirred for 2 days, then partitioned between brine and CH^CI^. The CH^CI^ layer was evaporated and HCI (4 ml of a 4 M solution in 1,4-dioxane) was added. The resulting solution was stirred for 3 h and evaporated to give a solid which was washed with Et^O and collected to give the amide intermediate (0.13 g) in 24%yield-<br>
Step 3: The product of Example 8, Step 3 (60 mg; trihydrochloride form) and the product of step 2 (35 mg) were treated in the same fashion as Example 8, Step 4 to give, after work up and purification, SAP as the free base form, which was converted to the HCI salt (50 mg) in 62% yield.<br>

Step 1: A solution of 4-N-BOC-2(S)-methyl piperazine (1,5g; 7.5 mmol), 4-methoxy-benzyl chloride (1.1 ml; 8.1 mmol) and diisopropyl ethyl amine (1.5 ml) in dry CH3CN were heated at reflux for 5 h. The reaction mixture<br>
was cooled to RT and volatiles were removed in vacuo. The residue was dissolved in CH2CI2 (30 ml) and washed with water and brine.<br>
Concentration gave the crude product, which was purified by FSGC (10% EtOAc-hexanes) to obtain 2.1g (88%) of product as a pale yellow liquid. TFA (6 ml) was added to a solution of the above compound (2Jg; 6.56 mmol) in 12 ml of CH2CI2 and the mixture stirred at 25° C for 1.5 h.<br>
The reaction was quenched with IN NaOH and adjusted to pH 10. Extractive work-up in CH2CI2 furnished the desired product (1.4g; 97%) as<br>
a colorless gum.<br>
Step 2: A mixture of the product of step 1 (1.4g; 6.36 mmol), N-BOC-4-piperidinone (1.27g; 6,4 mmol) and Ti(0iPr)4 (1.9 ml; 6.4 mmol) was stirred at 25° C for 24h. A 1M solution of Et2AICN in toluene (7,6 ml) was added to the reaction mixture and the mixture stirred at ambient temperature for another day. The Strecker amine thus formed was worked-up and isolated (27g; 100%) as described in Example 8, step 2. TLC Rf = 0.3 in 25%<br>
EtOAc-CH2Cl2.<br>
The Strecker amine (2.7g; 6.3 mmol) was dissolved in 15 ml of dry THF at 0° C and CHsMgBr (3M in EtaO; 10.5 ml) was added to it. After 1 h,<br>
the ice bath was removed and the reaction allowed to proceed at RT for 15 h. TLC analysis of the heterogeneous reaction mixture showed no change from the starting material; the mixture was warmed at 60° C for 5 h with no observed change in TLC behavior. The reaction mixture was<br><br>
quenched with saturated NH4CI and organic products extracted into CH2CI2. FSGC of the crude product (2.7g) using 15% acetone-hexanes as the eluant provided the desired ipso-methyl compound as a colorless gum (2.3g; 87%).<br>
Step 3: The product of step 2 (1.7g; 4.08 mmol), ammonium formate (1.4g-22 mmol) and 10% palladium on carbon (0.4g) were mixed in 20 ml of CH3OH and heated at reflux for 5 h. The reaction mixture was filtered<br>
through celite and volatiles were removed. The residue was dissolved in CH2CI2 and washed with 10% NaOH solution, water and brine.<br>
Concentration in vacuo gave l.lg (92%) of pale yellow gum. Step 4: A solution of the product of step 3 (0.12g; 0.4 mmol), p-trifluoro-methyl benzyl bromide (O.lg; 0.4 mmol) and diisopropyl ethyl amine (0.1 ml) in dry CH3CN was gently warmed (60-70" C) for 16 h. The mixture was cooled and organic product isolated via extractive work-up in CH2CI2. FSGC (10-30% Et20-CH2Cl2; Rf = 0.4) yielded the major product as a<br>
colorless film (0.12g; 68%).<br>
Treatment of the above product (in CH2CI2) with TFA (1 ml) for 1 h<br>
followed by basification and standard work-up provided the desired compound (0.09g; 96%) as a colorless film.<br>
Step 5: The product of step 4 (0.045g; 0.13 mmol) and 6-chloro anthraniiic acid (0.022g; 0.13 mmol) were coupled as described in Example 1 and after work-up and FSGC (5% CH3OH in CH2CI2) the title compound was<br>
isolated as a colorless film (0.058g; 90%).<br>
The HCI salt of the title compound was prepared in the usual manner by the reaction of the free base with 1M HCI-Et20 and processing the<br>
precipitate to obtain a beige solid (0.066g).<br>
Using a similar procedure, the product of step 3 was converted to other compounds, first by alkylation of the piperazine nitrogen with the appropriate halide, followed by deprotection and coupling of the piperidinyl portion with the appropriate acid to form the amides of general structure:<br>

water bath, iodine was added (27 g, 0.106 mol) and then [bis(trifluoro-acetoxy)iodo]-benzene (25 g, 0.058 mol). After being stirred at RT overnight in the dark, more [bis(trifluoroacetoxy)iodo]benzene (24 g, 0.056 mol) was added and the mixture was stirred at RT for one more day. The mixture was diluted with CH2CI2 (500 ml) and ice-cold Na2S03 (10%<br>
aqueous, 500 ml) and stirred for 0.5 h. The organic layer was separated and washed with NaHCOa, filtered through a short silica gel column and washed with CH2CI2 (500 ml). After CH2CI2 was evaporated, Et20 (125<br>
ml) was added and the mixture stirred for 10 min, Hexanes (600 ml) was added gradually to the Et20 solution and the mixture was stirred for 0.5 h.<br>

(200 ml) and NaOH (15 g, 0.375 mol) in water (100 ml) was added dropwise. The mixture was stirred at RT for 2.5 h. After the CH3OH was evaporated, the aqueous layer was extracted with Et20 (3x100 ml) and the combined organic portion was washed with brine, dried over Na2S04,<br>
filtered and concentrated to give a free amine.<br>
Methyl-fl-lactate (4,08 g, 0.039 mol) was dissolved in CH2CI2 (40 ml) and the mixture was stirred and cooled in acetone-C02 to -78° C under N2 atmosphere. Trifluoromethane sulfonic anhydride (10.2 g, 0.036 mmol) and then 2,6-lutidine (6.27 g, 0,059 mol) were added and the mixture was stirred for 5 min at -78° C. The mixture was warmed to RT and stirred for 30 min. More CH2CI2 was added to the mixture and the solution was<br>
washed with 2N HCI. The freshly prepared amine from above was added to the trifiate solution followed by K2CO3 (18 g, 0.132 mol) in water (20 ml).<br>
The mixture was stirred at RT overnight. Extractive work-up with CH2CI2<br>
followed by silica gel column chromatography gave a secondary amine (8.27 g, 75% yield, Rf = 0.65, hexanes/EtOAc, 3:1) as a yellow syrup.<br>
Step 3: The amine of step 2 (17.3 g, 0.052 mol) was dissolved in dichloroethane (100 ml) and CICH2COCI (117.2 g, 82 ml, 1.04 mol). The<br>

water. The white solid obtained was dried in air to give the diketopiperazine (14.3 g, 77% yield, Rf = 0.56, hexanes/ EtOAc, 3:1).<br>
Step 4: The diketopiperazine of step 3 (14.3 g, 0.04 mol) was dissolved in dimethoxy ethane (200 ml) and NaBH4 (15.1 g, 0.4 mol) and BFa-OEtj (34<br>
g, 29.5 ml, 0.24 mol) were added to the solution. The mixture was stirred under reflux conditions for 3 h and then cooled to about 0° C on a ice bath. CH3OH (500 ml) and then concentrated HCI (300 ml) were added slowly to<br>
the mixture. The solution was stirred for 20 min. at RT and then under reflux conditions for 45 min. The mixture was concentrated and NaOH was added until the pH was more than 10. Extractive work up with EtOAc gave the desired piperazine as a yellow syrup (12.9 g, 98% yield).

Step 1: The cyano amine was prepared from p-trifluoromethyl benzaldehyde and 2(S)-methyl-4-(tert-butoxycarbonyl) piperazine exactly as describedin Example 6, Step 1,<br>
Step 2: A solution of the cyano amine 2 (2,5 g; 6,53 mmol) in 30 ml of dry THF was placed under a blanket of Nj and cooled to -78° C, This solution was treated with a solution of sodium hexa-methyl disilazide in THF (1M; 26 ml) followed after 5 min with neat allyl bromide (6 ml). Upon removal of the bath and letting the reaction mixture warm to RT (-1h), it changed from a yellow solution to dark reddish brown solution. The reaction was quenched with saturated NH.CI solution and the product extracted with EtOAc, washed with water, brine and dried. Concentration in vacuo afforded a brown semi solid. FSGC of this material using 25% Et^O in hexane as eluant gave 2,5 grams (92%) of the desired product as an amber gum (TLC R, = 0,65, 0.6 for two overlapping spots).<br>
Step 3: A solution of the product of Step 2 (2.4g) in CH3OH was treated with 10% Pd/C (0.2g) and placed under a balloon of H^ gas. After stirring at RT for 4 h, the catalyst was removed via filtration through cellte. Concentration of the filtrate yielded an amber gum.<br>
The a-propyl nitrile obtained above was dissolved in CH^CN (12 ml). Magnesium bromide etherate (2.1 g; 8,14 mmol) and sodium triacetoxy borohydride (3.44 g; 16.2 mmol) were added and the reaction mixture was stirred at RT overnight. The reaction was quenched with water and rendered basic with saturated NaHCOa- The organic products were<br><br>
extracted with EtOAc and processed to obtain ~ 2 g of crude material. FSGC (10-25% EtjO in hexane) served to isolate two diasteromeric products (1.7g total; 79% for two steps):<br>
(S, S)-Diastereomer (A); TLC R, = 0.6 (25% Et,0-Hexane). 0.9 g of a colorless gum.<br>
(R, S)-Diastereomer (B): TLC R, = 0.5 (25% Et,0-Hexane). 0.8 g of a colorless gum.<br>
Step 4: Removal of the BOC-protecting group from the intermediate A was accomplished by treatment with TFA in CHjCI,. The isolated free piperazine (0.68g; 2.3 mmol), N-(tert-butoxycarbonyI)-4-piperidinone (0.45g; 2.3 mmol) and Ti(OiPr), ( 0.7 mL; 2.5 mmol) were dissolved in 10 ml of CHjClj and stirred overnight. EtjAICN (1M in toluene; 2.7 ml) was introduced into the reaction mixture and the resultant solution was stirred for a day. The reaction was diluted with EtOAc and quenched with water. Celite was added to aid in the filtration of titanium and aluminum salts. The biphasic filtrate was washed with water, brine and dried. Concentration in vacuo yielded 1.1 g of a yellow gum (TLC R, = 0.55 in 25% EtOAc-hexane). The resultant ipso-cyano compound was dissolved in dry THF (8 ml) and treated with a solution of CH^MgBr (3M in Et^O; 6 ml) and stirred overnight at RT. The reaction flask was placed in a cold water bath and carefully quenched with saturated NH.CI solution. The organic product was extracted with EtOAc and washed with water and brine. Concentration to a crude product which was purified by rapid FSGC (10-25% EtOAc in hexane) gave the BOC-piperidinyl compound as a pale yellow gum (l.lg; 100%). TLC R, = 0.6 in 25% EtOAc-hexane. Step 5: The BOC-protecting group on the piperidine nitrogen in the product of Step 4 was removed by treatment with TFA in CH^CIj. Basification with 1 M NaOH and processing in CH^Cl^ afforded the unprotected piperidine in 90% yield. This intermediate was coupled (EDCI, HOBt) to aryl and heteroaryl carboxylic acids to obtain the amides exemplified in the following table:<br><br><br>

Stepi: Solid m-CPBA was added to a solution of p-trifluorometliyl styrene (3g; 17.4 mmol) in 30 ml of CH.CIj and stirred at RT for 20 h. About 20 ml of a saturated solution of NaHCOjWas added and stirred at RT for 2 h. The mixture was diluted with 20 ml of CHjCljand the organic product extracted<br><br>
into the CH^CI^ layer. The organic extract was processed to obtain the crude product. FSGC gave 3g (90%) of the desired epoxide as a colorless oil. TLC R, ^ 0.8 (25% EtOAc in hexane).<br>
Step 2: Freshly prepared NaOCH3 (0.6g; 10,6 mmol) was added to a solution of the product of Step 1 (2g; 10.6 mmol) in 20 ml of anhydrous CH3OH. After stirring at RT for a day, CH3OH was removed in vacuo. The residue was dissolved in CH^CIj and washed with water and brine. Concentration, followed by FSGC, furnished 1,3 g (55%) of the carbinol as a colorless oil (R, = 0.3 50% Et^O in hexane).<br>
Step 3: The carbinol of Step 2 (1.3g; 5.9 mmol) was dissolved in CH^CI^ and cooled in an ice bath. Sequential treatment with Et3N (1.7 ml; 12 mmol) and CH3SO2CI (0.6 ml; 7.7 mmol) and stirring for 30 min formed the mesylate. The product was extracted by standard work up (yield = 100%).<br>
The mesylate (1.76g; 5.9 mmol) and 2(S)-methyl-4-(tert-butoxycarbonyl) piperazine (2.4 g; 12 mmol) were dissolved in 5 ml of CH3CN and heated to reflux for 19 h. The reaction mixture was cooled to RT and directly subjected to flash chromatography on silica gel. Eluting with 25%, then 50% Et^O in hexane served to isolate the diastereomeric products A and B (Total yield = 86%).<br>
A: R, = 0.5 (50% Et^O in hexane). Light yellow gum (0.9g; 42%) B; R, = 0.4 (50% Et,0 in hexane). Amber gum (1.13g;44%) Step 4: Reductive amination of the free piperazine dervied from A (0.9g; 2.2 mmol) with N-BOC-piperidin-4-one with the installation of the ipso-methyl group was carried out as described in Example 1, step 4. to obtain the BOC-protected piperidinyl compound (0.87g; 92%). R, = 0.3 (50% EtOAc in hexane).<br>

The following assays can be used to determine the CCR5 antagonistic activity of the compounds of the invention. CCR5 Membrane Binding Assay:<br><br>
A high throughput screen utilizing a CCR5 membrane binding assay identifies inhibitors of RANTES binding. This assay utilizes membranes prepared from NIH 3T3 cells expressing the human CCR5 chemokine receptor which have the ability to bind to RANTES, a natural ligand for the receptor. Using a 96-well plate format, membrane preparations are incubated with ^^251-RANTES in the presence or absence of compound for one hour. Compounds are serially diluted over a wide range of 0.001 ug/ml to 1 ug/ml and tested in triplicates. Reaction cocktails are harvested through glass fiber filters, and washed thoroughly. Total counts for replicates are averaged and data reported as the concentration required to inhibit 50 percent of total 125|. RANTES binding. Compounds with potent activity in the membrane binding assay are further characterized in secondary cell-based HIV-1 entry and replication assays, HIV-1 Entry Assay:<br><br>
Replication defective HIV-1 reporter virions are generated by cotransfection of a plasmid encoding the NL4-3 strain of HIV-1 (which has been modified by mutation of the envelope gene and introduction of a luciferase reporter plasmid) along with a plasmid encoding one of several HIV-1 envelope genes as described by Connor et al, Virology. 206 (1995), p. 935-<br><br>
944. Following transfection of the two plasmids by calcium phosphate precipitation, the viral supernatants are harvested on day 3 and a functional viral titer determined. These stocks are then used to infect U87 cells stably expressing CD4 and the chemokine receptor CCR5 which have been preincubated with or without test compound. Infections are carried out for 2 hours at 37 °C, the cells washed and media replaced with fresh media containing compound. The cells are incubated for 3 days, Iysed and luciferase activity determined. Results are reported as the concentration of compound required to inhibit 50% of the luciferase activity in the control cultures. HIV'1 Reolication Assav:<br>
This assay uses primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells or the stable U87-CCR5 cell line to determine the effect of anti-CCR5 compounds to block infection of primary HIV-1 strains. The primary lymphocytes are purified from normal healthy donors and stimulated in vitro with PHA and IL-2 three days prior to infection. Using a 96-well plate format, cells are pretreated with drug for 1 hour at 37 °C and subsequently infected with an M-tropic HIV-1 isolates. Following infection, the cells are washed to remove residual inoculum and cultured in the presence of compound for 4 days. Culture supernatants are harvested and viral replication measured by determination of viral p24 antigen concentration. Calcium Flux Assav:<br>
Cells expressing the HIV coreceptor CCR5 are loaded with calcium sensitive dyes prior to addition of compound or the natural CCR5 ligand. Compounds with agonist properties will induce a calcium flux signal in the cell, while CCR5 antagonists are identified as compounds which do not induce signaling by themselves but are capable of blocking signaling by the natural ligand RANTES. GTPvS Binding Assav:<br>
A GTPyS binding assay measures receptor activation by CCR5 ligands. This assay measures the binding of 35s labeled-GTP to receptor coupled G-proteins that occurs as a result of receptor activation by an appropriate ligand. In this assay, the CCR5 ligand, RANTES, is incubated with membranes from CCR5 expressing cells and binding to the receptor activation (or binding) is determined by assaying for bound 3^5 label. The assay quantitatively determines if compounds exhibit agonist characteristics by inducing activation of the receptor or alternatively antagonist properties by measuring inhibition of RANTES binding in a competitive or non-competitive fashion. Chemotaxis Assav:<br><br>
The chemotaxis assay is a functional assay which characterizes the agonist vs. antagonist properties of the test compounds. The assay measures the ability of a non-adherent murine cell line expressing human CCR5 (BaF-550) to migrate across a membrane in response to either test compounds or natural ligands (i.e., RANTES, M1P-1B). Cells migrate across the permeable membrane towards compounds with agonist activity. Compounds that are antagonists not only fail to induce chemotaxis, but are also capable of inhibiting cell migration in response to known CCR5 ligands.<br>
The role of CC chemokine receptors such as CCR-5 receptors in inflammatory conditions has been reported in such publications as Immunology Letters. 57, (1997), 117-120 (arthritis); Clinical &amp; Experimental Rheumatology. U (4) (1999), p. 419-425 (rheumatoid arthritis); Clinical &amp; Exoerimental Immunology. 117 (2) (1999), p.237-243 (atopic dermatitis); international Journal of Immunopharmacolooy. 20 (11) (1998), p. 661-7 (psoriasis); Journal of Allergy &amp; Clinical Immunology. 100 (6, Pt 2) (1997), p. S52-5 (asthma); and Journal of Immunology. 159 (6) (1997), p. 2962-72 (allergies).<br>
