				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The invention concerns the field of spinning mill technology and relates to a method according to the preamble of the first patent claim. The method according to the invention serves for piecing the thread which is formed, in a spinning frame and/or in a spinning position of an air spinning frame, of a staple fibre material, for example after a can change, after a bobbin change, after a thread breakage or after another spinning disturbance. The method can likewise serve for the starting of spinning, i.e. for the restart of a spinning process. The invention also concerns a spinning position, being equipped for the execution of the method according to the invention, according to the preamble of the corresponding independent patent claim.<br>
Speaking of air spinning frames, particularly a device is to be understood for the production of a spun thread from a fibre strand comprising a fibre guiding channel with a fibre guiding surface for the guiding of the fibres of the fibre strand into an inlet port of a thread guiding channel, further comprising a fluid device for the generation of a turbulence around the inlet port of the thread guiding channel and the measure according to the invention for the influence of the flow conditions within the spindle channel of a stationary spindle.<br>
Air spinning frames for the spinning of staple fibre materials usually comprise a large number of spinning positions, whereby in each spinning position a thread is spun from a supplied longitudinal fibre structure. Thereby the longitudinal fibre structure is first being refined, i.e., the fibre amount per unit of length becomes reduced by way of drafting.<br>
Then the refined fibre strand is being spun into a thread by generating a twist said thread is then withdrawn and wound up. For the refinement the longitudinal fibre structure is for example drafted by means of a drafting unit or dissolved with the help of a dissolving roller. For the thread formation by means of twist generation, an air spinning method is used, i.e. the thread fonnation is achieved by air twist generation.<br><br>
After an interruption of the air spinning process where the connection between the spun thread and the refined fibre strand (longitudinal fibre structure) to be spun is broken, this connection must again be repaired, not only, so that the produced thread is without interruptions, but also, that the spinning process can be started again. For such a reconnection of thread and longitudinal fibre structure, in particular with air spinning methods, the free thread end resulting from the interruption is pulled out upstream against the normal thread conveying direction through the twist generating point and then positioned there. Thereafter the thread take-off and the air twist generation means are again put into operation and the free front end (beginning) of the refined longitudinal fibre structure is supplied to the air twist generation, in such a manner that, during a short transition period, the end portion of the thread and the front portion (beginning) of the fibre strand move together through the twist generation means. Thereby, by means of the twist generation, the fibres of the fibre strand are tangled with the fibres of the thread end portion and the front portion of the fibre strand is connected in a kind of splicing action with the end portion of the thread. Thereby the spinning process is again put into operation.<br>
With the starting of the spinning, i.e. with a restart of a spinning process, it is possible to proceed in the same way, whereby, in place of the end portion of the thread produced before the spinning interruption, an auxiliary thread is used.<br>
In order that the piecing part allows a trouble free continuation of the spinning process, for this purpose, said piecing part and its periphery must comprise a sufficiently large tear resistance, i.e. this usually means, that this tear resistance should be at least as high as the tear resistance of the thread being produced in the momentary spinning process.<br>
Different methods are known to achieve a sufficient tear resistance of the piecing part. These methods act at the free thread end portion, at the free front portion of the refined fibre strand and/or at the timed coordination of the movement of the thread end portion and the fibre strand front portion by means of the twist generation.<br><br>
From the publication DE-4240653-A1 it is for example well-known to roughen the thread end portion and/or remove fibre ends from the dense fibre strand of the thread and to branch them off from the thread, whereby the tangling procedure with the newly supplied fibres improves and the tear resistance of the piecing part is being increased.<br>
From the same publication it is also known to prepare the thread end portion for splicing in such a manner, that the fibre mass gradually decreases towards the thread end that the thread itself thus tapers towards the end. A thread end portion tapered in such a manner is then led overlapping through the twist generation point for the splicing with a correspondingly tapered front portion of a longitudinal fibre structure (gradually increasing fibre mass).<br>
The use of a "pointed" front portion of a fibre strand for the piecing is for example described in the publication of the US-5802831 (Murata). According to this publication, a longitudinal fibre structure is drafted in a drafting unit before the twist generation, whereby the drafting unit comprises a pre-drafting zone at the inlet side and a main drafting zone at the outlet side. After an interruption of the spinning process the intake of the longitudinal fibre structure into the drafting unit and the pre-draft is stopped. In that the main draft is not stopped, the longitudinal fibre structure is torn between the pre-drafting zone and the main drafting zone and forms a free front portion there. After the interruption the intake and the pre-draft are again synchronized accordingly with the twist generation means, coupled to the corresponding drive unit and the thread take-off. The front portion of the longitudinal fibre structure, which is assumed to have a tapered form caused by the tearing off action, is thereby first subjected to the main draft, whereby it is assumed that the tapering mentioned is stretched accordingly and thus presents an improved piecing part.<br>
The method according to US-5802831 is still refined according to the publications US-5809764 and US-5934058 (both Murata), in that the tapering front portion of the longitudinal fibre structure, before the stretching, is shortened by a short part by tearing off, and in that in a draft of air, which is applied between the drafting unit and the twist<br><br>
generation point, the fibre mass of this front portion is additionally and accordingly reduced.<br>
It does show that it is difficult to prepare piecing parts with the methods mentioned which will meet the requirements. The threads pieced according to the methods mentioned tend to have a weak point with a too low fibre mass immediately after a piecing point. For this reason an up to 200% increased fibre mass in relation to the remaining thread is usually added to the piecing part, thus a safely sufficient tear resistance is given for the starting of the spinning.<br>
An older European application of the applicant (EP 01129189,5) is also concerned with this problem, said application has, however, not been published yet at the time of submission of the present application, its content is taken as an integrating part of this application. The object of this older application is supplemented by the present invention.<br>
Besides the piecing quality (strength of the piecing part), the state of the art of the piecing or the process for the starting of the spinning has still a further disadvantage. With these methods the piecing procedure is not always successful, so that the ratio of failed piecing procedures in relation to the total number of piecing procedure attempts is relatively high.<br>
The task as the object of the invention is now to provide a method for the piecing or the starting of the spinning which comprises a high probability of success of the piecing procedure and with that, the quality of the piecing points, in particular the tear resistance, is being improved.<br>
This task is solved by the method according to the independent main claim.<br>
The method according to the invention is based on the observation that the chances for a successful piecing procedure are substantially higher, if the overlapping end portions of the thread end and the torn longitudinal fibre structure are pressed together in the<br><br>
overlapping condition. By pressing together the fibres of the thread end and the longitudinal fibre structure (i.e. fibre strand) the friction forces acting between said fibres (i.e. static friction forces) are increased. This increased adherence of the end portions has a positive effect on the succeeding process of the piecing procedure. It reduces in particular the probability that the end portions thus "soldered together", separate again before (upstream) the means for twist generation or within said means for twist generation, e.g. during the twist generation by means of air, and that thereby the piecing procedure fails. The process reliability of the piecing or the starting of the spinning and thereby also the process reliability of the air spinning frame is thus increased.<br>
In addition, it has been found that surprisingly also the piecing quality concerning the tear resistance is improved. Thereby it is not necessary any longer that the piecer and/or the piecing point comprise an up to 200% increased fibre mass to obtain a sufficient tear resistance in relation to the remaining thread. The piecer comprises thus a substantially smaller sized thick part. Thanks to the tear resistance the length of the piecing part can also be chosen shorter. In that both the fibre mass and the length of the piecing part are reduced, the disadvantages which are connected with a piecing part will also be reduced.<br>
Pressing together the overlapping end portions of the thread end and the torn longitudinal fibre structure is preferably realized by means of the given possibilities, i.e. without additional devices. Particularly suitable for this is the clamping point of the part of the finess influencing unit (e.g. the pair of discharge rollers in the main draft of the drafting units) driven at the outlet side. Fundamentally, according to the idea of the invention, it would also be possible to provide a specific clamping or pressing device for the piecing procedure, by which device the thread end and the torn longitudinal fibre structure are pressed together.<br>
The variation to roughen or to taper the thread end and/or its overlapping end portion, e.g. with a device according to DE4240653-A1 has also proved advantageous, but not essentially necessary. The application of a pointed end portion of the longitudinal fibre structures, e.g. according to US 5802831, is also possible.<br><br>
The method according to the invention and its device is now described by way of an exemplified embodiment. The exemplified embodiment is described by way of figure 1. It is to be pointed out explicitly, however, that the claimed invention is not limited to the exemplified embodiment shown.<br>
Figure 1 shows an exemplary embodiment of a spinning position of air spinning frames to carry out the method according to the invention. This spinning position is equipped for a so-called air spinning method with refinement by drafting. The spinning position is furnished with a means 3 for air twist generation with a nozzle block 21 with nozzles 22 incorporated therein, a spindle 23 with a thread channel 24 and a supply block 25 with a fibre feed channel 26 and a needle 27 directed towards the inlet of the thread channel 24. For the refinement, the spinning position comprises as finess influencing unit a drafting unit 28 with, for example, three pairs of cylinders (intake cylinder 29, central cylinder 30 with tapes 31 and outlet cylinder 32 with clamping point 11).<br>
The intake of the drafting unit 28, thus for example the intake cylinders 29 and the central cylinders 30 with tape 31, are driven by a motor 33. The motor 33 is controllable by a control unit 34. For the controlling of the motor 33 the control unit 34 evaluates a return light 35 (ready signal) and a thread end signal 36 for the determination of the accurate position of the end 2 of thread end 1 of a thread end sensor 37, as well as a spinning position specific parameter<br>
During the actually known spinning process in the spinning position, according to figure 1, the longitudinal fibre structure 10\ supplied in conveying direction Z, runs between the intake cylinders 29 into the refinement means, and is subjected to a pre-draft between the intake cylinders 29 and the central cylinders 30 with a usually constant drafting ratio and between the central cylinders 30 and the output cylinders 32 it is subjected to a main draft with, if applicable, a variable drafting ratio. The refined longitudinal fibre structure 10 is sucked from the output cylinders 32 through the fibre feed channel 26 towards the inlet of the thread channel 24. Compressed air, supplied by the nozzles 22, generates, apart from the suction mentioned, a turbulence within the zone of the thread channel inlet, which serves the twist generation. The thread 11<br><br>
resulting from this twist generation is taken off through the thread channel 24 in take-off direction Z (the means for the thread take-off are not illustrated).<br>
During an interruption of the spinning process, for example in case of a thread break or bobbin change, first the motor 33 is stopped, while the output cylinders 32 keep running at least for a limited period of time. Thereby, the supplied longitudinal fibre structure 10' is torn between the tape 31 and the output cylinders 32 and the piece which is positioned downstream, is removed from the drafting unit by the output cylinders 32. Aften/vards the piece that remains downstream is disposed of if necessary, whereby the means for twist generation 3 are cleaned if required.<br>
For the positioning of the free thread end after an interruption of the spinning process, the upper or lower part of the supply block 25 and the upper or lower output cylinder 32 can, for example, be lifted off their working position in such a manner, in that the fibre feed channel 26 and the passage between the output cylinders 32 are made accessible for a return and a positioning of the thread end 1.<br>
The thread end 1, which is unwound from the bobbin or which can be an auxiliary thread (bobbin change), is withdrawn and/or returned, within a spinning position equipped in such manner, for the resumption of the spinning process, up to the main drafting zone between the central cylinders 30 and/or the tapes 31 and the output cylinders 32 and hangs freely around the lower output cylinder 32, where it is detected by the thread end sensor 37 (in particular its end 2). During the return through the nozzle block 21 and/or thread channel, auxiliary means, e.g. a suction device can be used. During the subsequent positioning of the thread end 1 on the output cylinders 32, it is to be made certain that the thread end 1 is arranged in alignment with the longitudinal fibre structure 10\ in particular within the clamping point 11 (not visible in the illustration in figure 1).<br>
The process for the starting of the spinning within a spinning position, as illustrated in figure 1, is controlled as follows: if the thread end 1 is positioned and all relevant parts of the spinning position have been repositioned into their working position, then the<br><br>
return signal 35 is transmitted to the control unit 34, for example by the personnel or by a piecing robot. AftenA/ards the control unit starts the process for the starting of the spinning. That means that the twist generation of the means for the air twist generation 3 and the thread take-off (if necessary with a predetermined graduation), so that the thread end 1 starts to move itself towards the twist generation place. As soon as the thread end sensor 37 detects the passing of the effective thread end 2, the control unit receives the thread end signal 36, by which then the actual piecing routine is started. After a delay, which first depends on the relative position of the end 2 (sensed by the thread end sensor 37), second on the position of the beginning of the end portion of the longitudinal fibre structure 10' (shortly before the clamping line 11), and third on the desired length of the overlapping end portion, the motor 33 is started. The motor 33 puts the pairs of rollers 30 and 29 up to a speed, synchronized with the output cylinders 32, within a very short time (hundredth of seconds), so that, at the time of the overlapping of the first fibres of the end portions of the thread end 1 and the longitudinal fibre structure 10, the rollers already rotate against each other at the correct speed ratio. The rollers can already comprise the respective nominal or operating speed, (i.e. speed of the normal, stationary spinning process) at the beginning of the, just explained, start of the spinning or the process of piecing. It is, however, also conceivable that the starting of the spinning and/or the piecing takes place at a lower speed level. Whereby, after the starting of the spinning, all turning rollers of the finess influencing unit synchronously run-up to their respective nominal or operating speed (e.g. on a ramp with a gear).<br>
For such a piecing routine it might be necessary that the control unit 34 also provides data concerning the starting profile of the output cylinders 32, the central cylinders 30 and the intake cylinders 29, as well as the thread take-off (not illustrated) and if necessary measuring data of correspondingly arranged speed sensors.<br>
If necessary, the twist generation of the means 3, i.e. in the present case the speed of the air supplied from the nozzles 22, in order to accomplish the piecing point, can be changed in relation to the normal spinning process, for example it can be increased to obtain a stronger turbulence for fibre tangling.<br><br>
The drafting unit 28, arranged upstream of an air twist generation means in a spinning position, can also only comprise two or more than three pairs of cylinders, whereby, during a spinning interruption, an intake-side part of the pairs of cylinders is stopped before an outlet side part of the pairs of cylinders. Thereby, after the spinning interruption, at least the intake-side part of the pairs of cylinders is run-up delayed, according to a predetermined ramp or according to a ramp determined by sensor signals. In figure 1 the central cylinders 30 and intake cylinders 29 present the part (by the motor 33) drivable at the intake-side of the finess influencing unit (here drafting unit 28), while the output cylinders 32 present the parts drivable at the output-side.<br>
For the start of the spinning or the method of piecing according to the invention for spinning positions of air spinning frames, which produce a thread from a longitudinal fibre structure during a spinning process, are required:<br>
A finess influencing unit (e.g. a drafting unit) with parts drivable at the intake side (e.g. a pre-draft) and at the outlet side (e.g. a main draft), whereby at least the part drivable at the outlet-side comprises a clamping point. A means for air twist generation (vortex) and a means for the thread take-off. The methods according to the invention comprise, after an interruption of the spinning process for the resumption of the production of the thread, the following steps - to be carried out in this order - (whereby it is assumed that ail structural components are stopped):<br>
Start-up of the finess influencing unit (e.g. drafting unit) with the parts drivable at the intake side (e.g. intake cylinder and central cylinder with tape) and at the outlet side (e.g. output cylinders);<br>
Tearing of the longitudinal fibre structures by stopping the drive unit of the part driven at the intake side (intake and central cylinder) and only subsequently stopping of the part driven at the outlet side (output cylinder), whereby the longitudinal fibre structure is torn at a rather accurate point between both parts, determinable by means of tests;<br><br>
Returning of the thread end, at which spinning or piecing is to be started, first through the means for the thread take-off, then by the means for the twist generation (e.g. means 3) and finally through the part driven at the outlet side (output cylinder of the drafting unit)<br>
Registration of the position of the end of the thread end or means to register, when the end of the thread end has reached a pre-determined position;<br>
Start-up of the means for the air twist generation (e.g. means 3), the means for the thread take-off and those parts driven at the inlet side as well as on the outlet side of the finess influencing unit.<br>
Whereby in particular:<br>
The return of the thread end through the part of the finess influencing unit driven at the outlet side, by opening the part of the finess influencing unit driven at the outlet side , takes place with succeeding;<br>
positioning of the thread end in the part of the finess influencing unit driven at the outlet side in alignment with the longitudinal fibre structure in the part driven at the intake side;<br>
Closing of the part of the finess influencing unit driven at the outlet side;<br>
The start-up of the part of the finess influencing unit driven at the outlet side , together with a take-off of the thread end through the part driven at the outlet side (output cylinder),<br>
followed by a time co-ordinated and delayed start-up of the part driven at the intake side, in such a manner, in that the end portions of the torn longitudinal fibre structures and of the thread end overlap and in the overlapping condition pass the clamping point of the part driven at the outlet side.<br><br>
It is obvious that these steps have to be carried out in the above indicated sequence. The invention is, however, not limited to this order, e.g. the step "determination of the position of the end of the thread end" can take place at different points of time. The same applies for the first two steps:<br>
Start-up of the finess influencing unit (e.g. drafting unit) with the parts drivable at the intake side (e.g. intake cylinder and central cylinder with tape) and the parts drivable at the outlet side (e.g. output cylinder),<br>
tearing of the longitudinal fibre structures by stopping the drive unit of the part driven at the intake side (intake and central cylinder) and only stopping the part driven at the outlet side aftenA/ards (output cylinder off), whereby thus the longitudinal fibre structure is torn at a rather accurate point between both parts, determinable by way of tests,<br>
are facultative for the actual piecing procedure, because it is to be assumed that with a production stop, the spinning position first stops the drive unit of the part driven at the intake side (intake and central cylinder) and only aftenwards the part driven at the outlet side (output cylinder) (normal process).<br>
These two steps thus must have preceded the piecing procedure.<br>
In a further variation of the method, the position of the end of the thread end is registered by respective means and transmitted to a control unit, which, at the resumption of the production of the thread, delays the start-up of the part driven at the intake side of the finess influencing unit, timed in such a manner, that the end portions of the torn longitudinal fibre structures and the thread end overlap on a predetermined length.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the length of the overlapping end portions essentially corresponds with the spinning distance d of the spinning position (see figure<br><br>
1). Thereby, the spinning distance d is defined as the distance between the port of the spindle 23 and the clamping line and/or the clannping point 11 of the output cylinder 32. It is also possible that this length of the overlapping end portions is longer than the spinning distance d of the spinning position mentioned.<br>
In a further embodiment of the invention, the end portion of the thread end 1, which is to overlap, is roughened or tapered.<br>
The spinning position equipped for the execution of the method according to the invention comprises its own, in the spinning position integrated, controllable drive unit for the parts on the inlet side of the refinement means or a correspondingly controllable gear unit between these parts on the inlet side of the refinement means and a central gear unit. The further parts of the spinning position to be driven, can be driven by simply coupling onto central drive units or also by drive units integrated in the spinning position, which are, if necessary, controllable.<br>
The invention also comprises a spinning position of an air spinning frame according to the invention. This corresponds in its configuration with the exemplified embodiment according to figure 1, this is why reference is made here to the description of figure 1. The spinning position according to the invention contains a finess influencing unit (drafting unit) with parts drivable at the inlet side and at the outlet side, whereby at least the part drivable at the outlet side is furnished with at least one clamping point. Furthermore the device comprises a means for the air twist generation, a means for the thread take-off, with a means for the determination of the position of the end of the thread end. According to the invention the part of the finess influencing unit driven at the outlet side can be opened in such a manner that its clamping point or clamping points lie free for a return and a positioning of the thread end.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention the part driven at the outlet side consists of at least one pair of output cylinders (32), whereby the upper or the lower cylinder of the pair of output cylinders can be lifted (see arrow and chain dotted roller in figure 1).<br><br>
In a further embodiment, the invention can provide for, that the means for air twist generation (3) comprises a twist stop (27) being effective for the thread end. As an example a thorn 27 is shown here. The particular feature is that the twist stop (27) is effective for the thread end and not only for the longitudinal fibre structure. From this result particularly good piecers.<br>
In the claims further embodiments of the invention are specified.<br>
It would also be conceivable that, in place of the clamping point 11 of the output cylinders 32, an additional device took over the function of the clamping point, i.e. the pressing together of the overlapping end portions of the thread end (1) and the longitudinal fibre structure (10'), for the piecing procedure. Such a device would aftenA/ards be swivelled away.<br>
The invention is not limited to the explicitly mentioned possibilities and embodiments. These variations are rather meant as a suggestion for the specialist, in order to implement the idea of the invention as favourably as possible. Further favourable applications and combinations are therefore easily derivable from the described embodiments, which, likewise, represent the idea of the invention and which are to be protected by this application. Some of the disclosed features were described in this description in combination and are jointly claimed in the following claims. It is, however, also conceivable to claim individual features of this description on their own or in other combinations in the application of the idea of the invention. The applicant therefore expressly reserves any different combinations within the scope of the application of the idea of the invention as its own.<br><br><br><br><br><br>

-	return of a thread end (1) at which the spinning has to be started or the piecing has to take place, first by the means for the thread taking-off, then by the means for generating a twist (3) and finally by the driven part at the outlet side (32) ofthe drafting unit (28)<br>
-	determination of the position of the end (2) of the thread end (1)<br>
-	-starting-up of the means for generating the air twist (3), the means for the thread take-off and the parts of the drafting unit (28) characterized in, that<br>
-	the return of the thread end (1) takes place through the driven part (32) at the outlet side ofthe drafting unit, by opening the driven part (32) of the drafting unit at the outlet side, whereby, aftenA/ards the thread end (1) is positioned in the driven part (32) at the outlet side of the drafting unit driven in alignment with the longitudinal fibre structure (10') in the driven part at the inlet side, and afterwards<br>
-	the driven part (32) at the outlet side ofthe drafting unit (28) is being closed again, and<br>
-	the starting-up of the driven part (32) at the outlet side of the drafting unit (28) takes place with a subsequent time co-ordinated and delayed start-up of the driven parts (30, 29) at the inlet side, in such a manner that the end portions of the torn longitudinal fibre structure (10') and of the thread end (1) overlap and pass, in overlapping condition, the clamping point (11) ofthe driven part (32) at the outlet side.<br><br>
2.	Method according to claim 1, characterized in that the step, concerning the return of<br>
the thread end (1) at which the start of spinning or the piecing has to take place, is<br>
preceded by the following two steps<br>
-	starting-up of the drafting unit (28) with the drivable parts (30, 29) at the inlet side and the drivable parts (32) at the outlet side,<br>
-	tearing of the longitudinal fibre structure (10*) by stopping the drive unit (33) of the driven part (30, 29) at the inlet side and only by subsequently stopping the driven part (32) at the outlet side.<br><br>
3.	Methods according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the position of the end (2) of the thread end (1), being registered by means (37), is transmitted to a control unit (34), which, with the resumption of the production of the thread, delays the starting-up of driven the part (30, 29) of the drafting unit (28), at the inlet side, timed in such a manner that the end portions of the torn longitudinal fibre structure (10*) and of the thread end (1) overlap over a predetermined length,<br>
4.	Method according to claim 3, characterized in that the length of the overlapping end portions essentially corresponds with the spinning distance (d) of the spinning position.<br>
5.	Method according to claim 3, characterized in that the length of the overlapping end portions is longer than the spinning distance (d) of the spinning position.<br>
6.	Method according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the end portion of the thread end (1) to be overlapped is roughened or tapered.<br>
7.	Spinning position of an air spinning frame containing a drafting unit (28) with drivable parts (29, 30) at the inlet side and drivable parts (32) at the outlet side , whereby at least the drivable part (32) at the outlet side is furnished with at least one clamping point (11), with a means for generating an air twist (3), a means for the thread taking-off, with a means (37) for the determination of the position of the end (2) of the thread end (1), characterized in that<br><br>
-    the driven part (32) at the outlet side of the drafting unit (28) can be opened in such a manner, that its clamping point (11) or clamping points lies free for a return and a positioning of the thread end (1).<br>
8.	Device according to claim 7, characterized in that the drivable parts (29. 30) of the drafting unit (28) at the inlet side and the drivable parts (32) at the outlet side (32) can be driven independently.<br>
9.	Device according to claim 7, characterized in that the spinning position comprises a control means (34) for carrying out the start of the spinning or the method of piecing according to claim 1.<br>
10.	Device according to claim 7, characterized in that the drafting unit (28) is a drafting unit and that the driven part (29, 30) at the inlet side realises a pre-draft and that the driven part (32) at the outlet side represents the outlet clamping line (11) of the drafting unit.<br>
11.	Device according to claim 7, characterized in that the means (37) for the determination of the position of the end (2) of the thread end (1) is a sensor.<br>
12.	Device according to claim 7, characterized in that the driven part (32) at the outlet side consists of at least one pair of output cylinders, whereby the upper or the lower cylinder of the pair of output cylinders can be lifted up.<br>
13.	Device according to claim 7, characterized in that the means for the air twist generation (3) comprise a twist stop (27), being effective for the thread end (1).<br>
14.	Device according to claim 12, characterized in that the twist stop (27) is a thorn.<br>
15.	Device according to claim 6, characterized in that the means for air twist generation (3) comprise a twist stop, which is not effective for the thread end (1).<br><br>
16. Method for starting the spinning process or piecing-method for s^nnning positions of air spinning frames substantially as herein described with reference to the accompanying drawing.<br><br><br>
Summary<br>
The invention concerns a start of spinning or the method of piecing for spinning positions of air spinning frames, which, during a spinning process, produce a thread (11) from a longitudinal fibre structure (10') and which, for this, comprise a finess influencing unit (28) with parts (30, 29) drivable at the inlet side and part (32) drivable at the outlet side with clamping points (11), a means for the air twist generation (3) and a means for the thread take-off, whereby, after an interruption of the spinning process, the resumption of the production of the thread comprises the following steps. In particular, the method does provide for, that the start-up of the part of (32) of the drafting unit (28), driven at the outlet side, takes place with a subsequent time co-ordinated and delayed start-up of the part (30, 29) driven at the inlet side, in such a manner that the end portions of the torn longitudinal fibre structure (10') and of the thread end (1) overlap and pass, in overlapping condition, the clamping point (11) of the part (32) driven at the outlet side.<br>
