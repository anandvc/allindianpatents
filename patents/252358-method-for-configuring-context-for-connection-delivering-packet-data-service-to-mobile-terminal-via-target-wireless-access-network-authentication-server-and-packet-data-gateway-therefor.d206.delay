PANASONIC CORPORATION<br>
A JAPANESE COMPANY<br>
OF 1006, OAZA KADOMA, KADOMA-SHI,,OSAKA 571-8501,<br>
JAPAN<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and<br>
the manner in which it is performed.<br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to a method for configuring a context for a connection delivering a<br>
packet data service to a mobile terminal via a target wireless access network. The mobile<br>
terminal is initially connected to an originating wireless access network and the packet<br>
data service may be provided to the mobile terminal via the originating wireless network.<br>
Moreover, the invention provides an authentication server, a packet data gateway and a<br>
packet data service support node which participate in the context configuration method.<br>
TECHNICAL BACKGROUND<br>
W-CDMA (Wideband Code Division Multiple Access) is a radio interface for IMT-2000<br>
(International Mobile Communication), which was standardized for use as the 3rd<br>
generation wireless mobile telecommunication system. It provides a variety of services<br>
such as voice services and multimedia mobile communication services in a flexible and<br>
efficient way. The standardization bodies in Japan, Europe, USA, and other countries<br>
have jointly organized a project called the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) to<br>
produce common radio interface specifications for W-CDMA.<br>
The standardized European version of IMT-2000 is commonly called UMTS (Universal<br>
Mobile Telecommunication System). The first release of the specification of UMTS has<br>
been published in 1999 (Release 99). In the mean time several improvements to the<br>
standard have been standardized by the 3GPP in Release 4 and Release 5 and<br>
discussion on further improvements is ongoing under the scope of Release 6.<br>
Another issue becoming more and more important for future mobile communication<br>
networks is the interworking between different access network technologies in<br>
heterogeneous networks.<br>
It has been recognised that WLANs (Wireless Local Area Networks) are, and will<br>
continue to be deployed by independent operators and that these WLANs may or may<br>
not be interworked with a mobile communication systems, such as 3GPP systems.<br>
Further, these WLANs may overlap partially or completely with WLANs that are<br>
interworked with Home and/or Visited mobile communication systems. Lastly, WLANs<br>
interworked with Home and Visited 3GPP systems may also overlap each other, as well<br><br>
as the radio access networks for each mobile communication system. These situations<br>
create multiple permutations of coverage areas and service states which will need to be<br>
carefully understood and managed.<br>
In this respect the 3GPP has standardized the interworking of 3G networks and WLAN<br>
(see 3GPP TR 22.934: "Feasibility study on 3GPP system to Wireless Local Area<br>
Network (WLAN) interworking", 3GPP TS 22.234: "Requirements on 3GPP system to<br>
Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) interworking" and 3GPP TS 23.234: "3GPP<br>
system to Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) interworking; System Description", all<br>
available at http://www.3gpp.org).<br>
There are number of different possible operating environments where interworking of the<br>
3GPP system and the WLANs may be desired. The 3GPP operates universally in<br>
Public, Corporate, or Residential environments. WLANs may also be deployed in any of<br>
these environments and it would be advantageous if the standards for 3GPP to WLAN<br>
interworking could accommodate all of these environments. Such capability would<br>
further enhance the ease of use for the mobile system user and virtually extend the<br>
effective coverage areas of each system.<br>
The different environments may involve different administrative domains and wide<br>
diversity of WLAN technical capabilities. As an example, the security capabilities and<br>
policies may differ between public, corporate and residential WLANs. These differences<br>
may lead to different interworking methods between 3GPP and WLANs.<br>
Different scenarios are identified describing different levels of interworking. E.g. scenario<br>
2 describes 3GPP-based access control and charging, scenario 3 relates to accessing<br>
3GPP PS based services, e.g. IMS, scenario 4 and 5 consider the access to 3GPP PS<br>
based services with service continuity.<br>
The protocol details are separated in several documents. In 3GPP TS 24.234: "3GPP<br>
system to Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) interworking; UE to Network protocols"<br>
the details of the protocols between WLAN UE and the network are described. In 3GPP<br>
TS 29.234: "3GPP system to Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) interworking; Stage 3<br>
Description" protocols for several network reference points are specified and in 3GPP TS<br>
33.234: "Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) interworking security" the security<br>
architecture, i.e. trust model and security requirements for the interworking of the 3GPP<br>
System and WLAN Access Networks are discussed.<br><br>
The details of the WLAN Access Authentication and Authorization procedure from the<br>
architectural view are described in chapter 7.2 of 3GPP TS 23.234 and the W-APN<br>
(WLAN Access Point Name) Resolution and Tunnel Establishment in chapter 7.9 of<br>
3GPP TS 23.234.<br>
The description of the GPRS architecture with its entities and functionalities can be found<br>
in 3GPP TS 23.060: "General Packet Radio Service (GPRS); Service Descriptions;<br>
Stage 2". Especially the logical architecture in chapter 5.4, the GPRS attach procedure in<br>
chapter 6.5, the mobility management states in chapter 6.1.2, the location management<br>
procedures in chapter 6.9.2, the PDP context activation procedure in chapter 9.2 and the<br>
appropriate HLR GPRS subscription data, MM and PDP contexts in chapter 13 are<br>
explained.<br>
If a terminal hands over from a 3G network to WLAN and is afterwards in idle mode in<br>
3G network. The terminal has to send periodic Routing Area Update (RAU) messages<br>
over the 3G air interface to preserve the MM and PDP contexts in the 3G SGSN. This<br>
requires the availability of 3G network coverage and a periodic 3G connection<br>
establishment for performing the RAU. If 3G network coverage is not available (user is in<br>
a shopping centre, at airport, in the subway) and the RA update timer expires, the MM<br>
and PDP contexts are deleted in the SGSN. Further the 3G network connection<br>
establishment for performing the RAU would increase 3G signalling overhead and UE<br>
power consumption.<br>
In addition, if the terminal starts a 3G service from WLAN coverage, there is no PDP<br>
context established in the appropriate 3G SGSN. Thus if handover from WLAN to 3G is<br>
initiated the 3G connection for the service must be initiated from scratch by performing<br>
and GPRS Attach procedure and a PDP Context Activation which are time consuming<br>
and imply a significant delay for service delivery through the 3G network.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The object of the invention is therefore to provide a method that allows establishing<br>
connection for packet service delivery to a mobile terminal from a wireless access<br>
network, as for example a UMTS, as fast as possible.<br>
The object is solved by the subject matter of the independent claims. Advantageous<br>
embodiments of the invention are subject matters to the dependent claims.<br><br>
According to one embodiment of the invention a method for configuring a context for a<br>
connection delivering a packet data service to a mobile terminal via a target wireless<br>
access network is provided. The mobile terminal is initially connected to an originating<br>
wireless access network and the packet data service may be provided to the mobile<br>
terminal via the originating wireless network.<br>
The authentication server may attach the mobile terminal to a core network connected to<br>
the target wireless access network to enable a reception of the packet data service via<br>
the target wireless access network. Further, the authentication server may initiate the<br>
establishment of a context within the core network connected to the target wireless<br>
access network wherein the context is established prior to an attachment of the mobile <br>
terminal to the target wireless access network.	<br>
This operation allows to set-up and configure parameters associated for packet data<br>
service delivery through the target wireless access network by establishing a context<br>
within one or more network nodes within the core network connected to the target<br>
wireless access network. Upon handover from the originating wireless access network to<br>
the target wireless access network, the user of the mobile terminal may benefit from the<br>
preconfiguration by a faster establishment of packet data service provision through the<br>
 target wireless access network.<br>
According to a further embodiment the authentication server may determine an address<br>
of a serving packet data service support node of the core network, wherein the serving<br>
packet data service support node serves the mobile terminal when attaching to the target<br>
wireless access network. Moreover, the attachment of the mobile terminal to the target<br>
wireless access network comprises sending a packet data service attach message to the<br>
serving packet data service support node.<br>
In a variation of this embodiment the mobile terminal may be authenticated at the<br>
authentication server and receiving location information of the mobile terminal may be<br>
received at the authentication server, for example during the authentication procedure.<br>
The determination of the serving packet data service support node may comprise a<br>
mapping of the mobile terminal's location information to an identifier of the serving packet<br>
data service support node.<br><br>
In another embodiment of the invention the context is a PDP context and/or MM context,<br>
the originating wireless access network is a WLAN, the target wireless access network is<br>
a UMTS or GSM radio access network and the packet data service is a GPRS service.<br>
According to another embodiment of the invention the establishment of the context in the<br>
core network connected to the target wireless access network comprises the following<br>
steps. A packet data gateway of a core network connected to the originating wireless<br>
access network may receive an address of the serving packet data service support node<br>
or an address of a gateway packet data service support node of the core network<br>
connected to the target wireless network from the authentication server. The packet data<br>
gateway may further determine context information based on the context information<br>
associated to a connection used for providing the packet data service to the mobile<br>
terminal via the originating wireless access network, and may transmit a context<br>
activation message comprising the determined context information to the serving or<br>
gateway packet data service support node to establish the context in the respective<br>
packet data service support node. The packet data gateway relays packets of the packet<br>
data service to/from the originating wireless access network.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the core network connected to the originating<br>
wireless access network and the core network connected to the target wireless access<br>
network is a core network common to the target and the originating wireless access<br>
network.<br>
Further, in another embodiment of the invention the authentication server may determine<br>
the address of the gateway packet data service support node based on the access point<br>
name of an access point in the core network connected to the originating wireless access<br>
network communicating via an air interface with the mobile terminal.<br>
In further embodiment, the a context activation message comprising the context<br>
information from the serving/gateway packet data service support node may be<br>
transmitted to the gateway/serving packet data service support node to establish the<br>
context at the respective packet data service support node.<br>
For example, the context may comprise QoS requirement for delivery of the packet data<br>
service and resource reservation information for reserving resources in the core network<br>
connected to the target wireless access network and/or the target wireless access<br>
network for delivery of the packet data service. According to this example, the packet<br><br>
data gateway may determine resource reservation information based on the context<br>
information associated to a connection used for providing the packet data service to the<br>
mobile terminal via the originating wireless access network, and may transmit the<br>
determined resource reservation information within the context activation message to the<br>
serving or gateway packet data service support node to reserve resources within the<br>
core network connected to target wireless access network and/or the target wireless<br>
access network for delivery of the packet data service prior to an attachment of the<br>
mobile terminal to the target wireless access network.<br>
In a variation of this example the authentication server may indicate to the packet data<br>
gateway whether to reserve resources for delivery of the packet data service.<br>
According to a further embodiment of the invention, a service request for delivery of the<br>
packet data service is received from the mobile terminal through the target wireless<br>
access network by the serving packet data service support node, and the packet data<br>
gateway may be requested to route data of the packet data service to the mobile terminal<br>
via the core network connected to the target wireless access network and the target<br>
wireless access network.<br>
In a variation of this embodiment, the request to the packet data gateway comprises the<br>
transmission of a context update message from the serving packet data service support<br>
node to the gateway packet data support node.<br>
Another embodiment of the invention foresees that the packet data gateway and the<br>
gateway packet data support node are comprised within one core network element.<br>
In a further embodiment the request mentioned above is a request for resources for<br>
delivery of the packet data service through the target wireless access network.<br>
Further, in a variation of the embodiment, a rerouting request message may be<br>
transmitted from the gateway packet data support node to the packet data gateway to<br>
request the routing of data of the packet data service to the mobile terminal via the target<br>
wireless access network.<br>
Another embodiment of the invention relates to an authentication server for initiating the<br>
establishment of a context for a connection delivering a packet data service to a mobile<br>
terminal via a target wireless access network. As before, the mobile terminal is initially<br>
^connected to an originating wireless access network and is provided with a packet data<br><br>
service through the originating wireless access network. The authentication server may<br>
comprise a communication means for attaching the mobile terminal to a core network<br>
connected to the target access wireless network to enable a reception of the packet data<br>
service via the target wireless access network, and for initiating the establishment of a<br>
context within a core network connected to the target wireless access network.<br>
According to this embodiment, the authentication server is adapted to initiate the context<br>
establishment prior to an attachment of the mobile terminal to the target wireless access<br>
network.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention the authentication server further comprises<br>
means adapted to perform the steps of the method according to one of the various<br>
embodiments outlined above.<br>
Further, one embodiment of the invention relates to a packet data gateway for initiating<br>
the establishment of a context for a connection delivering a packet data service to a<br>
mobile terminal via a target wireless access network. Again, the mobile terminal is<br>
initially connected to an originating wireless access network and is provided with a<br>
packet data service through an originating wireless access network connected to the<br>
packet data gateway.<br>
The packet data gateway may comprise communication means for receiving an address<br>
of the serving packet data service support node or an address of a gateway packet data<br>
service support node within the core network connected to the target wireless access<br>
network from an authentication server. Moreover the packet data gateway includes<br>
processing means for determining context information based on the context information<br>
associated to a connection used for providing the packet data service to the mobile<br>
terminal via the originating wireless access network. The communication means may be<br>
adapted to transmit a context activation message comprising the determined context<br>
information to the serving or gateway packet data service support node to establish a<br>
context in the core network connected to the target wireless access network prior to an<br>
attachment of the mobile terminal to the target wireless access network.<br>
Another embodiment of the invention relates to the packet data gateway which further<br>
comprises means adapted to perform the method according to one of the various<br>
embodiments outlined above.<br><br>
One other embodiment of the invention foresees a packet data service support node in a<br>
core network connected to a target access network for configuring a context for a<br>
connection delivering a packet data service to a mobile terminal via the target wireless<br>
access network. The mobile terminal is initially connected to an originating wireless<br>
access network and is provided with a packet data service through an originating access<br>
network connected. According to this embodiment the packet data service support node<br>
comprises communication means for receiving a packet data service attach message<br>
from an authentication server and processing means for attaching the mobile terminal to<br>
a core network connected to the target wireless access network in response to the<br>
packet data service attach message to enable a reception of the packet data service<br>
through the target wireless access network: Further the communication means is<br>
adapted to receive a context establishment request comprising context information from<br>
a packet data gateway and the processing means is adapted to establish the context<br>
based on the context information prior to an attachment of the mobile terminal to the<br>
target wireless access network.<br>
The packet data service support node according another embodiment of the invention<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The following paragraphs will describe various embodiments of the invention. For<br>
exemplary purposes only, most of the embodiments are outlined in relation to a UMTS<br>
communication system interworking with a WLAN. Also the terminology used in the<br>
subsequent sections mainly relates to the UMTS terminology and WLAN terminology.<br>
However, the used terminology and the description of the embodiments with respect to<br>
the UMTS to WLAN interworking architecture is not intended to limit the principles and<br>
ideas of the inventions to such systems.<br><br>
Also the explanations given in the Technical Background section above are merely<br>
intended to better understand the mostly UMTS and WLAN specific exemplary<br>
embodiments described in the following and should not be understood as limiting the<br>
invention to the described specific implementations of processes and functions in the<br>
mobile communication network or WLAN.<br>
One main aspect of the invention is to enable an authentication server to initiate the<br>
establishment of a context in a target network for a packet data service while the mobile<br>
terminal is connected to the originating network and receives the packet service through<br>
this originating network.<br>
For exemplary purposes the following case may be considered. If the terminal has WLAN<br>
coverage and an activated 3G service over WLAN, the appropriate 3G SGSN may be<br>
determined by the AAA server by the use of location information and a mapping function.<br>
The AAA performs the GPRS Attach and Routing Area Update and initiates the PDP<br>
Context Activation on behalf of the terminal before the terminal connects to the 3G<br>
network. This reduces 3G signalling overhead and terminal power consumption and<br>
further does not depend on 3G coverage.<br>
A possible architecture for 3GPP system to WLAN interworking with handover support is<br>
shown in Fig. 1. In addition to the current 3GPP system to WLAN interworking<br>
architecture for scenario 2 and 3, this architecture comprises an interface between the<br>
packet data gateway (PDG) and the GGSN for routing/relaying data packets from the<br>
GGSN to the PDG and vice versa. It should be noted that the functionality of the PDG is<br>
to a large extend similar to the one of the GGSN.<br>
Further an interface between an authentication server, according to the exemplary<br>
architecture an AAA Server and the SGSN to establish the MM (Mobility Management)<br>
and PDP (Packet Data Protocol) context for a user is incfuded.<br>
For a 3GPP/WLAN dual mode mobile terminal it is possible to access 3G services from<br>
an active 3G connection and also from an active WLAN connection.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention the mobile terminal may perform a GPRS attach<br>
procedure in the 3G network in order to access GPRS services. After completing the<br>
GPRS attach procedure the mobile terminal is in the so-called "PMM connected state"<br>
and the MM context may be created in the SGSN. This context may inter alia comprise<br>
the IMSI of the user, the current MM state and the Routing Area that identifies one or<br><br>
several cells of the mobile terminal's current location. The routing area identifier (RAI)<br>
may be broadcasted to the mobile terminals in RRC Idle mode and mobile terminals in<br>
RRC Connected mode may be notified on established RRC (Radio Resource Control)<br>
connections.<br>
If the user wants to start a 3G service (e.g. SMS, MMS, IMS) on its terminal, a service<br>
activation may be initiated by the PDP context activation procedure. In the PDP context<br>
activation procedure, the Access Point Name (APN) and the requested QoS is signaled.<br>
The APN may identify the GGSN, the Packet Data Network and optionally a service to be<br>
offered. If the PDP context activation is accepted, a PDP context is established for<br>
example in the SGSN and the GGSN and PDP PDUs (Protocol Data Units) can be<br>
transferred between the mobile terminal and the GGSN.<br>
If the mobile terminal has established a 3G service and detects WLAN coverage by<br>
scanning of WLAN beacons each WLAN beacon comprising a SSID identifying the<br>
respective WLAN, the handover from 3G to WLAN could be advantageously in terms of<br>
higher data rates and lower delay. The mobile terminal may for example select one of the<br>
available WLANs based on the received SSIDs.<br>
Further the mobile terminal could be provided with a list of preferred WLANs which may<br>
be used to a WLAN in case more than one beacon is received by the mobile terminal.<br>
The mobile terminal may establish a connection with the target wireless access network,<br>
i.e. the chosen WLAN. This connection establishment to the WLAN is also referred to as<br>
the mobile terminal associating to the WLAN.<br>
After associating to the WLAN, the mobile terminal may need to be authenticated in the<br>
WLAN. For example the WLAN Access Authentication (Re-authentication) may be<br>
initiated for this purpose. During this WLAN Access Authentication procedure EAP<br>
(Extensible Authentication Protocol) messages are commonly exchange between the<br>
mobile terminal, the WLAN access network (AN) and the 3GPP AAA Server. For the<br>
authentication of the user the user identity may be provided to the AAA Server in a NAI<br>
format (NAI = Network Access Identifier, see RFC 2486: "The Network Access Identifier",<br>
available at http://www.ietf.org) in the EAP messages.<br>
It should be noted that the mobile terminal is commonly assigned an IP address within<br>
the WLAN after being authenticated. Therefore, the mobile terminal does not yet have an<br>
 IP Address assigned which implies that the WLAN should support means to transport<br><br>
AAA messages from the mobile terminal to an AAA Server. On WLAN side specific<br>
means as e.g. specified by the WLAN standards IEEE 802.11i could be used. The<br>
transport of EAP messages from the WLAN access network to the AAA Server could be<br>
accomplished over RADIUS or Diameter.<br>
When transporting EAP messages via RADIUS or Diameter an identifier of the WLAN<br>
access network is included in the messages. This identifier can for example be included<br>
implicitly by including the optional sender IP address of the Network Access Server<br>
(NAS-IP) serving as a RADIUS client for the mobile terminal to a RADIUS message.<br>
Alternatively, the WLAN access network identifier may also be included explicitly, for<br>
example by including the WLAN access point's MAC address (link identifier) or the<br>
access router's address (APID) to an EAP message by the mobile terminal or by an<br>
entity in the WLAN access network.<br>
For service activat00000ion in a WLAN, the W-APN resolution and Tunnel establishment<br>
procedure for setting up a tunnel between the UE and the PDG is performed. For the<br>
Tunnel QoS setup, i.e. the setup of the tunnel QoS parameters, the QoS requirements<br>
may be either directly included in the establishment messages or the QoS signalling may<br>
be performed independently before or after the tunnel establishment. Further, the PDG<br>
could also determine the QoS requirements on basis of the specified service.<br>
An identifier of the WLAN Access Network may also be included in the messages<br>
exchanged between MS and PDG during tunnel establishment. For example, the WLAN<br>
AN identifier may be included explicitly, for example the 3G RAI, the AP MAC address<br>
(link identifier), a notified AR address (APID), a GPS retrieved position or the transport IP<br>
address assigned to the MS in the WLAN access network is included to the messages by<br>
the MS or by an entity in the WLAN AN. This identifier may for example be transmitted<br>
during the authentication and authorization check from the PDG to the AAA Server.<br>
After tunnel establishment and QoS setup the GGSN is triggered to route/relay the<br>
packets to the PDG and the PDG may tunnel the packets to the MS in WLAN. Please<br>
note that it is also possible that GGSN and PDG are physically located in one single<br>
network element. Further the 3G radio bearers to the MS may be released and the MS is<br>
moved to 3G idle mode.<br>
As already indicated above, in case the terminal has to send periodic Routing Area<br>
Update (RAU) messages over the 3G air interface to preserve the MM and PDP contexts<br><br>
in the 3G SGSN, if 3G network coverage is not available (user is in a shopping centre, at<br>
airport, in the subway) and the RA update timer expires, the MM and PDP contexts may<br>
be deleted in the SGSN.<br>
Also in case the MS activates a service in WLAN first, may result in a situation where the<br>
MS is not GPRS attached and has no PDP contexts established in the 3G network. Here<br>
the GGSN may not be involved in the delivery process of data packets to/from the MS,<br>
since the PDG may be directly connected to the external network or service provider as<br>
illustrated in Fig. 1.<br>
Because WLAN coverage can get lost suddenly, it is of advantage to have faster service<br>
activation in the 3G network after/during handover from WLAN back to 3G. For this<br>
purpose one embodiment of the invention suggests to establish the PDP (and MM)<br>
contexts in the GGSN and SGSN in advance, i.e. before the MS attaches to the 3G<br>
network.<br>
If the user is subscribed to support of seamless service handover between<br>
heterogeneous networks, e.g. from WLAN to 3G, the establishment of MM and PDP<br>
context in the Core Network nodes during WLAN connection can be performed in<br>
different levels. In dependence on the subscription level the user may be allowed to have<br>
no, low or full resource reservation for a packet data service delivery in the 3G without<br>
the MS being connected to the 3G network.<br>
According to an embodiment of the invention the GPRS attach procedure and RA update<br>
is performed in case no resources have been reserved in the 3G network. Low<br>
reservation may mean that the PDP context is activated within the Core Network<br>
elements of the 3G network, but no QoS is negotiated, i.e. no resources (0 kbit/s) are<br>
reserved in the network for service delivery. In case of a 'full reservation' the PDP context<br>
may be activated, resources in the 3G network according to negotiated QoS parameters<br>
are reserved and optionally also RABs for service delivery may be setup before the MS<br>
is actually handing over to the 3G network.<br>
In order to maintain the MM and PDP context in the SGSN and to keep the MS GPRS<br>
attached, a preservation function can be used. This function allows to preserve active<br>
PDP contexts in the SGSN for released radio bearers (which are released for example<br>
by the RAN because of a break of the radio connection) and to re-establish the radio<br>
bearers later. As outlined previously, this may require that periodic RA Updates are sent<br><br>
to the SGSN. Otherwise the mobile reachable timer in the SGSN expires and the GPRS<br>
detach procedure would be initiated for the MS. Alternatively, a special WLAIM RAI may<br>
be sent from the MS to the SGSN so that the Timer controlling the duration of the<br>
activation is set to a very high value or the mobile reachable timer may even not be used,<br>
i.e. no timeout of MM and PDG contexts may be foreseen. However, this latter option<br>
may cause further problems in that e.g. all network elements activating a MM or PDP<br>
context would have to keep track of its deactivation as well.<br>
For the transmission of RA Updates from the MS it is required that 3G coverage is<br>
available, that the MS is continuously listening to broadcast messages and that a RRC<br>
connection is established.<br>
In one exemplary embodiment, it is assumed that the MS has an active WLAN<br>
connection and the AAA Server is informed about the current location of the MS (due to<br>
the implicitly/explicitly transmitted WLAN identifier). Thus, is no need for the MS to<br>
occupy 3G radio resources and to actively send messages on a 3G connection to<br>
preserve a state in the SGSN. This situation is for example depicted in Fig. 2 where the<br>
WLAN Connection Setup and 3G Service activation 201 is intended to exemplarily<br>
illustrate the connection of the MS to a WLAN and the activation of a GPRS service.<br>
According to this embodiment, the AAA Server in the 3G network may have access to a<br>
location mapping function. This mapping function may be employed to determine 202 the<br>
possible SGSN serving the terminal when a handover to the 3G network would occur<br>
and the matching Routing Area in the 3G network in the same coverage of the current<br>
WLAN.<br>
Every time the MS moves and changes the location, the AAA Server may be informed<br>
about the new location through an authentication procedure of the MS. When the<br>
location of the MS is changing, the AAA Server may determine the corresponding SGSN<br>
and RAI again and in case of a change the AAA Server may signal an update to the<br>
appropriate 3G network nodes.<br>
Optionally the AAA Server may also check first if there is a SGSN registered for the MS<br>
within the HLR/HSS 203. If there is a registered SGSN that differs from the determined<br>
SGSN, the PDP contexts in that SGSN may be deleted 204. This check may be<br>
performed for example by the AAA server querying the HLR/HSS of the MS.<br><br>
After determining the SGSN serving the coverage area of the WLAN in the 3G network,<br>
the AAA Server may initiate a GPRS attach procedure 205. An GPRS attach procedure<br>
according to an illustrative embodiment of the invention is shown in Fig. 3. In this<br>
exemplary procedure the AAA Server may transit 301 a GPRS attach message to the<br>
determined SGSN. Further, the AAA Server or the SGSN may update 302, 305 the<br>
location of the WIS in the HLR/HSS and the HLR/HSS is triggered to send 303, 304 the<br>
subscriber data for the user to the SGSN. If the MS was already GPRS attached at this<br>
SGSN the messages may be ignored. Finally the network initiated GPRS attach is<br>
accepted 306 and the MM context is established in the SGSN.<br>
After completion of the AAA Server initiated GPRS attach 205, the AAA Server may<br>
(optionally) perform a routing area update procedure 206. In this procedure, the AAA<br>
Server may send a routing area update to the SGSN in order to indicate to the SGSN to<br>
maintain the PDP and MM context for the UE. Furthermore the routing area update may<br>
be sent by the AM Server every time the location of the MS in the WLAN changes such<br>
that the corresponding 3G RAI is also changing. Moreover, the AAA server may transmit<br>
routing area updates to the SGSN to restart the Routing Area Update Timer before<br>
expiry.<br>
As mentioned above, the PDG may be informed on the service for the user and the QoS<br>
of the tunnel for the MS in WLAN. Next, the AAA Server may initiate 207 the PDP<br>
context establishment in the network nodes of the core network. An exemplary context<br>
establishment procedure 207 is illustrated in Fig. 4. The AAA Server may request 401<br>
the PDG to activate PDP contexts related to the tunnels established for a user in the 3G<br>
network. For this purpose the PDG may determine 402 the PDP context parameters from<br>
the WLAN tunnel settings, such as the QoS parameters associated thereto. It should be<br>
noted that this context activation in the GSNs of the 3G network may not only based on<br>
the QoS parameters of the tunnel in the WLAN for the user but also based on the<br>
subscription level of the individual user.<br>
Additional parameters for performing the PDP context activation may be included in the<br>
message (see 401) from the AAA Server to the PDG. The PDG may aggregate amongst<br>
others the IMS), SGSN address, APN, PDP address, QoS Requested and QoS<br>
 Negotiated in a request message and may send 403 the request to the GGSN to create<br>
and activate a PDP context. The GGSN's address may for example be determined by the<br>
PDG based on the APN received from the AAA Server. The GGSN may create a PDP<br><br>
context for the 3G idle user according to the received parameters and in addition a PDP<br>
context activation is initiated 404, 406 from the GGSN to the SGSN.<br>
On reception of the PDP context activation message from the GGSN, the SGSN<br>
establishes the contexts for the user. Moreover, based on the I subscription level of the<br>
user the SGSN may optionally establish 405 RABs in the RAN for the user, i.e. may<br>
reserve resources for service provision to the user through the 3G network. Upon<br>
receiving 407 a PDP Context Activation Response message reporting on the context<br>
establishment, the PDG may inform 408 the AAA Server that the context has been<br>
established in the GSNs.<br>
Alternatively, the PDG may send the request message to the SGSN directly. The<br>
address of the SGSN may be made known to the PDG from the AAA server, which<br>
would no longer need to resolve the GGSN address from the APN in this case. The<br>
SGSN may create and activate the context(s) and may also trigger a context<br>
establishment at its SGSN.<br>
If the MS loses WLAN coverage or if there is another trigger to handover the MS to the<br>
3G network, a 3G radio connection will be (re-)established 208. Generally there may be<br>
the following three scenarios to consider in this respect.<br>
If there are already RABs established in the RAN and resources for service provision<br>
have been reserved, only the radio bearers from the RAN to the MS must be set up<br>
which will further improve the performance of the handover between the heterogeneous<br>
networks.<br>
Otherwise the MS may initiate a service request procedure to the SGSN to (re-<br>
establishes RABs and radio bearers. In case the RABs and radio bearers have been<br>
configured and established before handover of the MS but no resources have been<br>
reserved in the core network, the PDP Context Modification procedure may be initiated to<br>
change the assigned QoS.<br>
A third option may be that the RABs have been set up but no resources in the RAN have<br>
been reserved. In the network nodes of the core network a PDP context comprising<br>
reserved QoS and required QoS parameters may be established. If the reserved QoS<br>
parameters "reserve" no resources (0 kbit/s) this means that no resources are reserved<br>
within the core network but the PDP context is established in the network nodes. A<br>
similar mechanism may also be used in the RAN. Thus, in case of establishing RABs<br><br>
there may be no resources reserved in the RAN but a context associated to the RABs<br>
may be established prior to the MS attaching to the 3G network.<br>
After completion of (or during) the 3G connection establishment 208, the MS may initiate<br>
a 3G Service Setup procedure 209. An exemplary procedure is shown inn Fig. 5.<br>
According to this procedure a Service Request 501 for a GPRS service is received by<br>
the SGSN. The SGSN may inform 502 the GGSN by a PDP Context Update Request<br>
that the MS desires to receive the GPRS service through the 3G network. This message<br>
may for example also be used to allocate resources in the 3G network for service<br>
delivery if not done previously, Upon receiving the message, the GGSN may send<br>
downlink packets to the SGSN.<br>
For example, if the initial service activation procedure was directly to the PDG, the PDG<br>
may further be informed 503 to relay the packets to the GGSN and no longer to the<br>
downstream nodes in the WLAN. The messages exchanged between MS (UE), SGSN,<br>
GGSN and PDG may be confirmed or acknowledged 504, 505, 506 by respective<br>
messages.<br>
