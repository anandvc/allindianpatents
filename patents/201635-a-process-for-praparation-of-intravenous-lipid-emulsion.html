The present  invention relates generally to process of preparation of lipid emulsion. Specifically the present invention relates to lipid emulsion used as Intravenous lipid emulsion.<br>
Intravenous Upld emulsion Is a dinical nutrition product falling under the banner c4 ^critical care products'. The major specialities where Intravenous lipid emulsion is used are gastroentBrt^ogy^ oncologYt major surgeries^ trauma^ central nervous system ailments &gt;Mhich results In swttllowing difficulty, malabsorption etc<br>
All Intravenous lipid emulsions essendaliyoomprfsecf an aqueous carrier, an emuisifler agent and an oil component.<br>
Intravenous lipid emulsion now in use are mostly imported ones and<br>
prohibitively costly. Most of these preparations use fiits rfch in long chain fiitty acids particularly, unsaturated fatty acids such as oleic add, linoleic add, linolenic acid and saturated fatty adds like palmitic acid and stearic add. The fats commonly used are soya bean oil^ and sunflower oil. This has two major disadvantages. Firstly It is known that these long chain fiaitty adds lead to accumulation of fit In the organs which Is not desirable. Secondly the polyunsaturated fatty adds present are subfect to lipid peroxidation which results In free radical generation with consequent damage to organs. This damage by free radical is one of the major factors invc^ed in the pathogenesis<br>
of several disordanE.<br>
SUMMARY QP THE INVgrmftN<br>
As is known^ the lipid emulsion are meant to be infused into a person as a dinical nutrition and It Is desired to have minimal damage «»the organs as skle effiBct.<br>
Our long experience in this area has revealed that medium chain saturated fat supplemented with low level of long chain pafyunsaturatad fats to<br><br>
satisfy the essential fatty adds requirement, are Ideal for Intravenous lipid Binuislon formulation. Medium and short chain fatty acldsara mfltafaoised In a different way. They are oxidized for energy productian and do not lead to accumulation of fats In organs. More important as saturated fatty adds, they do not undergo lipid peroxidation, with very little free radical generation.<br>
In the known prior art, as described above excess free radicals are generated by lipid peroxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids. These free radicals cause damage to organs. In certain situations^ due to this disadvantage^ it is not desired to prescribe lipid emulsion.<br>
QMECT OP THg TilVeilTlON<br>
It has been tested and found that lipid emulsion using medium chain saturated fats supplemented with low level of long chain polyunsaturated fats to satisfy the essential fatty acid requirement greatly reduces the free radical generation and accumulation of fat in organ thereby providing an ideal intravenous lipid emulsion formulation.<br>
Another object of the Invention Is to pvovide an intravenous lipid emulsion having characteristics such as Improved stability for storage.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide an intravenous iqiid emulsian having characteristics usd'ul in infusion to all patients without any fear of side effects.<br>
DEaCMPTIOli<br>
Lipid emulsions ar« wall known and are prepared by very many known<br>
conventional methods. A lipid emulsion Is a substanttally permanent heterogeneous lk)uld mixtures of two or more liquids that do not normally dissolve in each other, by mechanical agitation or by smal amount of additional substances known as emulslflers. Typically in preparing the emdsionsy the lipkls<br>
are added to ethanoi or chloroform or any other suitable organic solvent and agitated by hand or mechanical techniques. 1Tie solvent is then evaporated from<br><br>
the mixture leaving a dried glaze of lipid The Ipfdsare fesuspended in aqueous madia, sucli as phosphate ixrffered saline resulting in an emulsion.<br>
To achieve a more homogeneous size distributton of the emulsified lipids, the mixture may be sonicated using com«mk)nalSoiiiftatlontechni(|ues^ further emulsified using micro fluldisation fusing and /or extruded under high pressure (600 psi) using an extruder device.<br>
In preparing the lipid emulsaanj paiHailarty useful addftivtts are Soya bum<br>
Ledthln, gluou« und D.L alpha - Tocopheral (Vtaimin Q generally preferred In a particular ratia These additives are particularly usefUi where intravenous applicatJon is desired.<br>
It is a well recognized prior art, that any of the lipid compounds and preparation containing the lipid compounds may be lyophilised for storage and reconstituted in, for example, an aqueous medium (such as sterile water or Phosphate buffered saline) with the aid of vigorous agitation.<br>
In order to prevent agglutination or fusion of lipids as a result of lyophllization, it may be usehjl to include additivet in the formulation ID prevent such fusion or agglutination. Additives which may be useful include sorbitol, mannitol, sodium diloride, glwxtae, beliakMe, polyvinylpyrrolidone and polyethylene glycol.<br>
As per tlte invention, we are reducing in the process of preparation of emulsion, the use of fats rich in long chain polyunsaturated fatty adds and instead are replacing the same with a mixture of medium chain saturaosd 6iC5 supplemented with low level c^ long chain polyunsaturated fats. By this the icnown disadvantage prevalent in the prior art i.e., high amount of fet<br>
accumulation in various organs Is appreciably reduced if not toftaiy eliminated The level in the blood of the products of lipid peroxidation from the<br>
polyunsaturated fatty acid, i.e. free radicals is appreciably reduced.<br><br>
oils and fills conialnlnfl fatty adds, which are predominantly 16-18 carbons long and contain zero to three double bonds, estsrified togtycerd are referred to as long chain triglycerides.<br>
Medium chain fatty acids esterified to glycerol form medium chain triglycerides. Medium chain triglycerides are triglyoeridesmade iivith saturated Cio to Ci4 fatty addsi These shorter chain triglycerides are metabolised differently from long chain triglycerides by the body. The fotty adds generated frcxn the medium chain triglycerides are mainly axidizBd to prcxfide a sourm of<br>
quick energy, with consequent decreased deposition of fats In organs. Since they contain very little polyunsaturated ftitty adds, there would less of lipid peroxidation and free radical generation.<br>
Incorporation of a small quantity of long chain triglycerides containing polyunsaturated fatty acid along with medium chain trli^cerides has the added advantage that they satisfy the requirement of the essential fatty adds, which are long chain poly unsaturated fatty acid.<br>
It was not also not daa r In v lew of pr lor art ttiat when long cha in fatty acids combined with medium chain l^tty adds in a trlglyoeride molecule, that the combination would provide a reduction in free radical gencratloa Aprooesshad to be developed to demonstrate a redudjon in free radicalgeneratkin whidi is part of this invention.<br>
Further It has also found that such a mixture of medium chain triglycerides with small amount of long chain triglycerides hasthe advantage of more stable emulsion with smaller partide size.<br>
It has been found that long diain fatty acids are metabolised by a pathway different from that of the medium / short chain fatty adds. The long chain fatty adds present in the fats leads to aocumUbitlonoffots in organs whk:h is not desirable and also the polyunsaturated fattf adds present in these fats due to lipid peroxidation result in free radical generation, wvhidi damage the organs. Therefore there Is a need for a fat composition containing trighrcerktes containing long chain polyunsaturated fatty adds and triglycerdes containing<br><br>
saturated medium ctiafn fatty adds, which provide a cUnicaliy nutritionai intravenous lipid emulaian with minimal side effects on the patienL<br>
