				<td>A METHOD AND PLANT FOR FORMING<br>
CERAMIC TILES OR SLABS<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a method and plant for forming ceramic tiles and<br>
slabs.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Research in the ceramic sector is currently aimed at obtaining products<br>
imitating natural stone, such as marble and granite. These products are<br>
characterised by the presence of continuous veining of random pattern extending<br>
through the entire thickness of the slab.<br>
Such ceramic tiles or slabs are produced by compacting, by hydraulic<br>
presses, semi-dry atomized, ground or re-granulated powders variously mixed<br>
together in prearranged or random manner. Specifically, the powder mixtures are<br>
deposited by suitable means into the forming cavities of rigid steel mou!ds with<br>
which the proces are provided, and are then pressed to obtain the product.<br>
The same applicant has already conceived a forming method which<br>
comprises the following operative steps:<br>
- preparing a hopper having a discharge mouth of dimensions at least equal to the<br>
dimensions of the at least one cavity of the mould of a forming press, both in the<br>
translation direction of an underlying carriage with loading tray and in the direction<br>
perpendicular thereto,<br>
- depositing in the hopper in a prearranged and/or random manner a mixture of<br>
powders of different characteristics in such a manner as to<br>
create therein a mass of powders presenting veining variously disposed<br>
within the mass,<br>
- from said mass of powders, withdrawing in succession portions having,<br>
in the carriage translation direction, a dimension equal to a fraction of the<br>
dimension of the hopper mouth, and in the direction perpendicular thereto<br>
the same dimension as the hopper mouth, such as to withdraw an entire<br>
layer of powders from said mass,<br>
- depositing said layer in an orderly manner in the interior of said at least<br>
one cavity by means of the carriage, and pressing the powders.<br>
The described method is implemented by a plant comprising a fixed<br>
hopper for containing a mixture of powders presenting bulk veining in<br>
imitation of a natural stone. With the lower mouth of the hopper, which<br>
has the same plan dimensions as the cavity of the forming press, there are<br>
associated movable means arranged to deposit in the cavity a succession<br>
of powder portions withdrawn from said hopper, until the cavity is<br>
completely filled.<br>
Although it operates well, the described plant is little versatile in terms of<br>
format change, this now being an essential characteristic in a modem<br>
plant. In this respect, the technology is increasingly aimed at obtaining<br>
ceramic slabs or tile having variable dimensions in accordance with market<br>
requirements. There is therefore the need for a more versatile plant which<br>
enables the tile or slab format to be changed rapidly without the need for<br>
lengthy interruptions in production.<br>
The object of the invention is to satisfy said requirement within the<br>
framework of a simple and rational solution.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention attains said objects by a method for forming ceramic<br>
tiles or slabs, comprising the following operative steps: arranging a hopper, driven<br>
with reciprocating movement, above a conveyor belt; depositing in the hopper in a<br>
prearranged and/or random manner a mixture of powders of different<br>
characteristics in such a manner as to create in the hopper a mass of powders<br>
presenting veining in imitation of a single block of natural stone; from said mass of<br>
powders, withdrawing in succession portions having, in the belt advancement<br>
direction, a dimension equal to a fraction of the dimension of said hopper in the<br>
same direction and, in the direction perpendicular to the preceding, the same<br>
dimension as the hopper mouth, such as to withdraw an entire layer of said mass;<br>
depositing said layer onto said belt; and pressing the powders by a continuous<br>
pressing system.<br>
Preferably, the dimension of the powder portions in the belt translation direction is a<br>
function of the graphic resolution to be obtained on the finished tile. The powders<br>
are preferably fed to the hopper by at least one feeder movable relative to the<br>
hopper.<br>
The present invention also provides a plant for forming ceramic tiles or slabs<br>
comprising a conveyor belt, above which there is positioned a hopper containing a<br>
mixture of powders presenting bulk veining in imitation of a natural stone, with said<br>
hopper there being associated powder distribution means arranged to feed the<br>
powders to the underlying conveyor belt, wherein said powder distribution means<br>
are fixed whereas said hopper is movable above said means to deposit on said<br>
advancing belt a succession of powder portions in such a manner as to create a<br>
continuous powder strip which said belt feeds to a continuous pressing station.<br>
Preferably, the hopper is driven by suitable means which cause it to translate<br>
reciprocatingly above the distribution means. Preferably, the speed of translation of<br>
the hopper has a modulus or absolute value speed different from the speed of<br>
translation of the underlying conveyor belt. The powder distribution means<br>
preferably comprise a fixed plate provided centrally with a slot perpendicular to the<br>
direction of translation of said belt, the plate having a dimension in the belt<br>
translation direction which is equal to at least double the dimension of the lower<br>
mouth of said hopper in the same direction, and a dimension in the direction<br>
perpendicular to the preceding which is at least equal to the dimension of the lower<br>
mouth of the hopper in the same direction. The dimension of the slot, in the tray<br>
translation direction, is preferably between 10 and 50 mm, or between 20 and 40<br>
mm. The slot has a dimension, in the direction perpendicular to the advancement<br>
direction of said belt, which is a function of the corresponding dimension of the tile<br>
which is to be formed. A perimetral scraping surround is associated with the lower<br>
edge of the slot. The height of said surround is preferably between 1 and 300 mm.<br>
Specifically the invention provides a method for forming ceramic tiles or<br>
slabs in a continuous press arranged to form a slab of indefinite length comprising<br>
the following operative steps:<br>
- arranging a hopper above a moving conveyor belt,<br>
- depositing in the hopper in a prearranged and/or random manner a mixture of<br>
powders of different characteristics in such a manner as to create in the hopper a<br>
mass of powders presenting veining peculiar to a single block of natural stone,<br>
- from said mass of powders, withdrawing in succession portions having, in the<br>
belt advancement direction, a dimension equal to a fraction of the dimension of said<br>
hopper in the same direction and, in the direction perpendicular to the preceding,<br>
the same dimension as the hopper mouth, such as to withdraw an entire layer of<br>
said mass,<br>
- depositing said layer onto said belt by gravity, and<br>
- pressing the powders by a continuous pressing system.<br>
According to the invention, said portions are withdrawn by moving the hopper with<br>
reciprocating movement in the belt advancement direction above suitable<br>
distribution means.<br>
Said method is implemented by a tile forming plant comprising a conveyor belt,<br>
above which there is positioned a hopper movable with to-and-fro movement in the<br>
direction of the belt axis and containing a mixture of powders presenting bulk<br>
veining in imitation of a natural stone. With said hopper there are associated<br>
powder distribution means arranged to<br>
enable a succession of powder portions to fall by gravity onto said belt, to<br>
create a continuous powder strip which said belt feeds to a continuous<br>
pressing station.<br>
The hopper is driven by usual known means.<br>
The powder distribution means comprise a fixed plate provided centrally<br>
with a slot perpendicular to the direction of translation of said belt, said<br>
plate having a dimension in the belt advancement direction equal to at<br>
least double the corresponding dimension of the lower mouth of said<br>
hopper, and a dimension in the direction perpendicular to said belt<br>
advancement direction equal to the corresponding dimension of the lower<br>
mouth of the hopper.<br>
The slot with which the plate is provided presents, in the belt advancement<br>
direction, a dimension which is a function of the graphic resolution to be<br>
obtained on the finished tile. The slot dimension in the belt advancement<br>
direction varies between 10 and 50 mm, and preferably between 20 and<br>
40 mm.<br>
According to a first embodiment of the invention, said continuous pressing<br>
station is arranged to compact the powder strip created on the belt to a<br>
pressure sufficient to obtain a continuous coherent product intended to<br>
undergo a second final pressing after being divided into blanks of<br>
predefined dimensions by a usual cutting station, before feeding the<br>
blanks to firing.<br>
In this first case, the pressure exerted on said powder strip reaches a<br>
value not exceeding 100 bar.<br>
Alternatively, said continuous pressing station compacts the powder strip<br>
to a maximum pressure close to 250-300 bar. The thus compacted<br>
product does not require a subsequent second pressing, and can hence<br>
be divided into blanks by a usual cutting station, to be fed directly to firing.<br>
In both embodiments the plant can be provided with scraping devices to<br>
remove a thin layer of powders in order to display the veining present in<br>
said strip, and also with further devices for the controlled deposition of<br>
further decorative powders on said strip.<br>
The operation of the method of the invention and the constructional<br>
characteristics and merits of the relative means for its implementation will<br>
be better understood from the ensuing description given with reference to<br>
the figures of the accompanying drawings which illustrate a particular<br>
preferred embodiment of said means and of some constructional variants<br>
thereof by way of non-limiting example.<br>
Figure 1 is a schematic side view of the plant according to the invention.<br>
Figure 2 is an enlarged view of the section ll-ll shown in Figure 1.<br>
Figures 3 and 4 schematically show the operation of the invention.<br>
Said figures show the plant 1, which comprises a conveyor belt 2, above<br>
which there are positioned means 3 for creating a continuous powder strip<br>
100 on the belt 2, a suction scraping system 4, a continuous pressing<br>
station 5 and a cutting station 6.<br>
The said means for creating the continuous powder strip 100 comprise a<br>
hopper 7 driven with reciprocating motion, in which the powders are<br>
deposited by an overlying movable feeder 70 also driven along two<br>
mutually perpendicular directions in a plane parallel to the plane of the belt<br>
2, and caused by known means, not shown, to slide above the upper<br>
mouth of the hopper 7.<br>
The purpose of the feeder 70 is to deposit by gravity at least two powders<br>
of different characteristics into the hopper 7 such that they together form a<br>
mass presenting variously disposed veining reproducing that present in a<br>
natural stone. In other words this mass can be said to reproduce a block<br>
of natural stone, which is then cut into layers which are deposited on the<br>
belt 2 by the distribution means 8 associated with the hopper and<br>
described hereinafter.<br>
In the illustrated embodiment, to limit slippage of the powders during their<br>
discharge onto the belt 2, the internal volume of the hopper 7 is divided by<br>
baffles 71 (Figure 2) positioned at the hopper exit mouth. A second series<br>
of baffles 72 is associated with the upper mouth of the hopper, to mix the<br>
powders fed into the hopper 7 in order to create the veining and the<br>
aesthetic effects as randomly as possible in imitation of the veining<br>
appearing in a block of natural stone.<br>
In other embodiments of the invention, only the baffles 71 or only the<br>
baffles 72 could be provided, or alternatively none at all.<br>
The hopper 7 is associated with a drive system, not shown, which causes<br>
it to translate with reciprocating motion above the powder distribution<br>
means 8.<br>
In the illustrated embodiment, said distribution means 8 are associated<br>
with the lower mouth of the hopper 7 and comprise a fixed plate 9<br>
provided with a slot 10, disposed perpendicular to the translation direction<br>
of the plate 9.<br>
The plate 9 has a dimension in the direction perpendicular to the belt<br>
advancement direction which is greater than the corresponding overlying<br>
dimension of the hopper 7, and a dimension in the belt advancement<br>
direction equal to at least double the corresponding dimension of the<br>
hopper 7. The slot 10 has a dimension in the direction perpendicular to<br>
the belt advancement direction which is equal to the corresponding<br>
dimension of the lower mouth of the hopper 7, and a dimension in the belt<br>
advancement direction which depends on the graphic resolution to be<br>
obtained on the finished tile.<br>
The slot 10 is provided lowerly with a perimetral surround 101 which<br>
delimits the thickness of the powder strip deposited on the belt 2, to<br>
prevent the strip sliding against the lower surface of the plate 9.<br>
The height of the surround 101 varies between 1 and 300 mm, depending<br>
on the actual embodiment of the invention.<br>
Downstream of the hopper 7b there is positioned a usual device 40 for<br>
scraping the upper surface of the powder strip 100. Said device 40 is<br>
connected to a suction system, not shown being of known type, which<br>
enables a thin surface layer of powders to be removed from the strip 100<br>
in order to exalt the graphics and the contrast between the different<br>
coloured powders of the strip 100.<br>
The belt 2 feeds the powder strip to a continuous pressing station 5, also<br>
of known type, comprising an upper compacting band 50 provided to<br>
compact the powder strip on the lower belt 2 to obtain a continuous<br>
compacted product.<br>
Means for laterally retaining the powder strip on the belt 2 are associated<br>
with said compacting band 50. These latter lateral retention means are<br>
not shown as they are known to the expert of the art.<br>
According to the present embodiment, the compaction effected by the<br>
compacting band 50 is sufficient to obtain a compacted product which<br>
does not require further compacting. In this case the maximum<br>
compacting pressure reaches values close to 300 bar.<br>
Once compacted, the product is divided into blanks of predefined<br>
dimensions by a usual cutting device 6. In the illustrated embodiment,<br>
said device essentially comprises a rotary blade 60 for making the cut in<br>
the direction perpendicular to the belt advancement direction, and at least<br>
two further rotary blades 61, only one of which is visible in the figures, for<br>
cutting the compacted product in the advancement direction of the belt 2.<br>
The described plant is controlled by a processor, not shown, which<br>
controls its operation in the following manner.<br>
While the belt 2 advances (Figure 4), the hopper 7 translates<br>
reciprocatingly on the plate 9 in such a manner as to deposit adjacent<br>
powder portions on the belt 2, to create thereon a continuous powder strip<br>
which is firstly scraped by the system 4, and then compacted in the<br>
compacting station 5. Downstream of the compacting station the rotary<br>
blades 60 and 61 cut the strip into blanks of predefined dimensions.<br>
It should be noted that when the hopper movement is reversed (Figure 5)<br>
the manner of depositing the powders on the belt 2 varies, to the<br>
advantage of their random distribution, resulting in a greater naturalness of<br>
the different coloured veining present in the powder strip.<br>
The manner of distributing the powders can be further varied by changing<br>
the hopper translation speed, in addition to the movement of the overlying<br>
feeder 70.<br>
