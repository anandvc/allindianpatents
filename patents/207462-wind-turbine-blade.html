1   WIND TURBINE BLADE<br>
The present invention relates to a blade for wind turbines, in which blade, on the periphery layer of the cross section of the blade, a number of pre-fabricated strips are arranged.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Wind turbine blades are today manufactured comprising a bearing central inner beam, commonly of a hollow, square cross-section and made from a glass fibre and resin composite, surrounded with two shells forming the upper and the lower outer surface of the blade and determining the aerodynamic properties thereof. The shells may be of a single layer or at least along a part of the circumference be a sandwich construction comprising two parallel layers of glass fibres and resin having a space in between filled with e.g. a polyurethane foam. The use of a wooden material to reinforce the inner side of a single layer shell or to fill the space of a sandwich construction is well known. It is realised that the forces and torque increase steeply with the increasing length of blades and that the strength and stiffness of the inner beam must be steeply increased as well for the known blades, as the shells only contribute minor to the overall load bearing properties of the blade. In order for the shell to bear a substantial part of the forces of the inner beam, the above discussed structures that are reinforced with wooden material require for larger dimensions of blades a thickness of the wooden layer that would increase the weight of the blade significantly, thus causing increased stresses to the blade.<br>
It is the object of the invention to provide a wind turbine blade having properties of laminated products, i.e. high strength in comparison with the amount of material and lower production costs compared to solid products, but where the strength compared to the costs of manufacturing the blade is highly increased compared to prior art blades.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
This object is obtained by a blade, which blade over a substantial longitudinal part comprises a layer along an outer periphery of the cross-section of the blade, said layer being constituted by a plurality of pre-fabricated strips arranged in a sequence along the outer periphery of the blade.<br><br>
WO 03/008800	PCT/DK02/00506<br>
2<br>
By the term "a substantial longitudinal part" is understood a part extending over at least a third of the total length of the blade from tip to hub, preferably over at least half of the total length of the blade. According to a preferred embodiment, 60-85% of the total length, such as about 70%, comprises such layer.<br>
Thereby, the optimal material properties may be obtained by combining different types of strips, such as pultruded fibrous composite strips comprising different fibres, such as carbon fibres, glass fibres and/or natural fibres, wooden strips, composite strips formed as hollow tubes etc. Each of the types of strips are much simpler, and thus cheaper, to manufacture than to form a whole blade, and the strips may be joint by suitable methods, such as by injection of resin or by vacuum infusion of resin.<br>
According to the Invention, a wind turbine blade may be obtained, which reduces the forces and torque on theInner-beam. Furthermore, the resistance against tension and compression forces in a layer near the outer periphery of the shell provides the blade with an Improved structural efficiency with respect to an edge-wise bending mode.<br>
Accordingly, in a preferred embodiment, at least some of the pre-fabricated strips are made from pultruded fibrous composite material, such as carbon-resin.<br>
Thereby, a construction is obtained with an excellent stiffness, but which is not. prone to buckling. Thus, the inner structure of the blade may be made of a lighter construction, e.g. by replacing the commonly used inner beam of a square cross section with two lighter webs at the leading edge and the travelling edge, respectively.<br>
The periphery layer may, in a preferred embodiment,, be assembled by injection of resin or by vacuum infusion of resin. Use of resin infusion leads to a speedy, healthy and safe manufacturing process, leaving no or only very few voids in the resin. A limitation of the number of voids reduces subsequent finishing. A very little amount of the fibres In the blade is actually infused. The resin is mainly a glue rather than a matrix. This results in a structure being more tolerant to any possible voids.<br>
According to one, preferred embodiment, the blade over a substantial longitudinal part    comprises a layer along the outer periphery of its cross-section, wherein the layer at least partly is constituted by strips of a wooden material and strips of a fibrous composite<br>
material In an alternating sequence along the outer periphery.<br><br>
WO 03/008800	PCT/DK02/00506<br>
3<br>
Thereby, the excellent stiffness of fibrous composite materials and the high resistance against buckling of wooden materials is combined to achieve a shell with suitable properties in a cost-effective manner.<br>
An especially advantageous embodiment comprises at least some strips made from a wooden material, preferably plywood used as the wooden material, and natural fibre pultrusions, preferably carbon fibre pultrusions, as the fibrous composite material. The advantages obtained by this embodiment are that the materials are compatible and both are having low thermal expansion coefficients. Both types of material work at similar low range of strains resulting in the possibility of stiffer blades as compared to the weight of the blades. Also, natural fibres may be prone to buckling, and although wood is bulky, wood is not prone to buckling, thus also for this reason, the two types of material are very complementary.<br>
The strips may in general be made from wood, laminated wood, pultrusions from any fibre man-made or natural with any resin, thermoset, thermoplastic, man-made or naturally derived, foam plastics, lightweight core materials in any proportion. At least some of the pre-fabricated strips are advantageously formed from a fibrous composite material. The fibres of the fibrous material may be any known fibre having suitable properties to reinforce the wood composite, such as carbon fibres, glass fibres, Kevlar fibres, natural fibres, e.g. from hemp of flax, coir fibres, etc. or any combination thereof. As example, carbon has a higher strain to failure than wood. Carbon acts as stiffening additive but wood fails first. This has been taken advantage of in coupon testing to prove strength of carbon and wood separately. Adding carbon and thus the possibility of using thinner skins may reduce skin buckling margins. Carbon fibres are relatively expensive, however, wood is cheap and can cover the area of the blade incurring very low costs. Wood itseif, however, produces thick inefficient skins in highly stressed blades. Carbon fibres combined with wood may produce thinner skins, which are structurally efficient and satisfying. Also, wood is highly defect tolerant. The percentage of the total cross-sectional area of the shell comprised of fibrous composite material is preferably within the range of 3% to 30% in the part of the blade having highest content of the fibrous material, more preferred within the range of 6% to 20%.<br><br>
WO 03/008800	PCT/DK02/00506<br>
4<br>
Likewise, the of the total cross-sectional area of the shell comprised of fibres is preferably within the range of 2% to 20%, more preferred within the range of 4% to 15%.<br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment of the present invention, at least some of the strips are constituted by hollow tubes formed from a fibrous composite material. Thereby, material and weight is saved while advantageous structural properties are preserved.<br>
At least some of the strips of the fibrous composite material are preferably pultruslons, I.e. strips made by pultruding mixture of fibres and a matrix material that is cured after pultruslon, such as a processable resin, e.g. vinyl ester. Thereby, a strip having straight fibres and a low void content Is obtained. Also, a low content of resin may be obtained leading to little shrinkage and rapid curing.<br>
It Is thus advantageous that the pultruslons have a pultruslon direction substantially aligned with a longitudinal direction of the blade In which direction the properties of the fibres are required. However, pultruslon terminating joints are stress raisers, so particular attention is being given to these in structural element testing.<br>
The fibrous composite material comprises advantageously a fibre volume fraction of 50% to 90%, preferably from 60% to 80%. In particular, the fibrous composite material may comprise a carbon fibre volume fraction of 50% to 90%, preferably from 60% to 80%.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment at least some of the pre-fabricated strips are made from a wooden material as wooden materials are low in costs an light weight, and the material properties of the wooden material may be completed to form the required blade material properties by combining with strips of other material types, such as fibrous composite materials. The wooden material may be strips of wood, which if necessary are glued together in the longitudinal direction of the blade.<br>
A preferred embodiment employs plywood. In particular unidirectional plywood as the wooden material because of the homogeneous material properties. Another type of wooden material that may be employed is comprised by wooden fibres held In a cured resin. Wood is seeing same direct stresses, so it is possible to use new joint patterns and glues using established design allowables, and still being confident of the structure of the wooden material.<br>
The layer is, according to one embodiment, at least partly constituted by strips of a wooden material and strips of a fibrous composite material in a sequence along the outer periphery. The sequence may preferably be an alternating sequence of strips of a wooden<br><br>
WO 03/008800	PCT/DK02/00506<br>
5<br>
material and strips of a fibrous composite material. The alternating sequence preferably ranges over only a part of the complete periphery of the blade.<br>
It is advantageous that the layer discussed is part of a sandwich construction as discussed previously. I.e. is enclosed in an outer shell and an inner shell made from a fibrous composite material such as glass fibre web held by a cured synthetic resin.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The blade shown In cross-section in Fig. 1 has a layer comprised of 40 x 40 millimetre strips of birch plywood 1 in alternating sequence with 6 x 40 millimetre strips of a carbon fibre pultrusion 2. The layer 1,2 stretches along the central part of the blade between two C-beams 3,4 of glass fibre web and synthetic resin composite denoted the LE (leading edge) Web 3 and the TE (travelling edge) Web 4 and replacing the central inner beam discussed previously. The layer 1,2 is sandwiched between an inner layer 5 and an outer layer 6 of glass epoxy skins that carry shear stress and promote the transverse stiffness of the blade. The space defined between the upper and lower shell thus constituted by the birch plywood 1 and the carbon fibre pultrusion 2, and the LE Web 3 and the TE Web 4 is filled with a balsa wood core 7.<br>
The blade shown in Figs. 2a, 2b and 2c are similar to the one shown in Fig. 1 with the exception that the reinforcement of carbon fibre pultrusions 2 are situated near the areas of contact between the upper and the lower shell and the LE Web 3 and the TE Web 4, where the stress concentration is highest. In the embodiment shown, double web is used instead of a single web. This is to give sufficient buckling margin on the skins during compression. Also, the leading web reduces the leading edge joint shear load, allowing a smaller leading edge joint area. This is advantageous during manufacturing of the blade.<br><br>
WO 03/008800	PCT/DK02/00506<br>
8<br>
The technology is advantageous in that the addition of fibre pultrusions to a wood construction promotes the stiffness of the construction. The carbon fibre pultrusions are not used all along the blade length but only In the middle 70% where required by the stresses. The blade skin cross section may be up to 10% by area of carbon fibre pultrusion in the more highly stressed regions, dispersed throughout the wood composite in the shown embodiment. The skins are typically 60% of the thickness of the blade skins comprised purely by wood, which reduces weight and improves the structural efficiency In the critical edgewise bending mode. The outer and inner glass epoxy skins are manufactured with glass fibres oriented plus and minus 45 degrees to the longitudinal direction of the blade.<br>
Pultrusions have the advantage of guaranteeing straight fibres and low void content In the carbon fibre composite itself. Furthermore, pultrusions have the advantage of speeding the blade infusion process as the fine carbon fibres would otherwise need significantly more time to infuse. The pultrusion has a high fibre volume fraction, about 70%, with a medium strength but highly processable resin, as example vinyl ester. Preferably, when manufacturing the blade, the resin is supplied with "peelply" on the two long sides, which is removed to produce a clean textured surface ensuring a good bond.<br>
The manufacturing process of a shell of a blade shown in Rg. 3 comprises the steps of applying a gel coat (not shown) to a mould 8 followed by a transfer media 9 such as a transfer mesh, 45 degrees glass fibre web 10 and epoxy (not shown) to the mould to create the outer glass epoxy skin. Hereafter the wood and pultrusion strips 1,2 are positioned and a metal mesh 11 such as an aluminium mesh for the lightning protection is<br>
	then applied. The shell is then wrapped in a container, in the process shown a vacuum bag<br>
12, which Is evacuated by exterior means 13. Then, resin is injected from a resin reservoir<br>
14 through resin channels 15 formed between adjacent strips, from which the resin<br>
spreads throughout the construction driven by the vacuum. A general resin used for<br>
infusion Is Prime 20 from SP Systems. After curing of the resin, an inner glass epoxy skin<br>
)   16 is manufactured on top of the wood and pultrusion strips 1,2.<br><br>
