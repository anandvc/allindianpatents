				<td>METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR MOTION VECTOR PREDICTION IN TEMPORAL VIDEO COMPRESSION<br>
Claim of Priority under 35 U.S.C. ยง119<br>
[0001]	The present Application for Patent claims priority to Provisional<br>
Application No. 60/589,818 entitled "Method and Apparatus for Motion Vector Prediction in Temporal Video Compression" filed July 20, 2004 and assigned to the assignee hereof and hereby expressly incorporated by reference herein.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Field<br>
[0002]	The present invention relates generally to video compression, and more<br>
particularly, to a method and apparatus motion vector prediction in temporal video compression.<br>
[0003]	Motion estimation is a critical feature in video coding systems where<br>
temporal redundancy in video sequence is exploited. Motion estimation is the process of estimating the current macroblock (or block) in the frame to be predicted based on a block in a previously decoded frame. Generally, the process involves searching the predicted frame for a block that matches the current block based on a measure to minimize distortion. For example, measures that are currently used include sum of absolute differences (SAD) and sum of squared differences (SSD). Typically, the search commences based on an initial guesstimate (location in reference frame) derived using motion vector prediction.<br>
[0004]	Where a video codec incorporates multiple reference frames and multiple<br>
macro-block types in motion vector prediction, the motion vector prediction process introduces very extensive computation. Experiments have shown that the motion estimation can consume 60% (one reference frame) to 90% (five reference frames) of the total encoding time. To reduce the computation complexity in motion estimation while keeping the rate-distortion is a challenging topic. Currently, the related research is focused on obtaining more accurate motion vector predictors and applying early termination by detecting zero blocks in order to reduce processing time or even skip the pixel search step. The accuracy of the predicted motion vector is critical in controlling<br><br>
the total motion estimation time. In the standard for motion vector prediction in the<br>
H.264 video codec as proposed by the Joint Video Team (JVT) of ISO/IEC MPEG &amp;<br>
ITU-T VCEG (ISO/IEC JTC1/SC29/WG11 and ITU-T SGI6 Q.6), JVT-1050, 9TH<br>
Meeting, Sept. 2003 (JVT standard), various methods are used to improve the prediction<br>
of the motion vectors by introducing more motion vector candidates.<br>
[0005]	For example, as shown in FIG. 1, the adjacent blocks on the left, top, and<br>
top-right of a current block 102 are used to predict the motion vector of the current block:<br>
pred __ mv = median(mv _ A, mv _ B, mv _ C)<br>
[0006] where the pred jnv is defined as the median predictor, and mv_A, mvJB, mv_C are<br>
motion vectors for blocks A 104, B 106, C 108, respectively. To better utilize the<br>
motion relationship between the seven inter-prediction modes, one proposal applies a<br>
hierarchically search order from mode 1 to 7 rather than the proposed search order in the<br>
JVT standard. The motion vector of an upper-layer of the current block that is regarded<br>
as a candidate to predict the motion vector of the current block is shown in FIG. 2.<br>
Other proposals use more motion vector candidates in the temporal sequences by<br>
considering the motion vectors of the corresponding neighboring blocks and all the<br>
reference frames. As illustrated in FIG. 3 and FIG. 4, the corresponding motion vectors<br>
of the previous and other reference frames are used as the prediction candidates as well.<br>
It should be noted that in the multiple reference frame model in FIG. 4, a motion vector<br>
in a reference frame is scaled according to its temporal distance from the current frame.<br>
[0007]	The precision of the motion vector prediction plays a critical role in<br>
controlling computational reduction steps such as early termination, fast search method, and fast mode decision (e. g., skip mode) in motion estimation.<br><br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0008]	The embodiments described herein provide four approaches for motion<br>
vector prediction and schemes to incorporate these approaches to achieve an improved performance in a rate-distortion sense. The methods and apparatus described herein improve the accuracy of motion vector prediction. In one embodiment, the motion vectors of all non-causal blocks of the current block are incorporated in calculating the motion vector predictor by utilizing a more spatial correlation information from the lower resolution version of the original video frame. In another embodiment, chrominance components are integrated with the luminance component to predict more accurate motion vector by using the color information. In yet another embodiment, the system takes into account motion vector information that may be present in a MPEG-2 metadata stream in a video stream transmission system. In still yet another embodiment, a motion vector processing technique is applied to eliminate (i.e., smooth) false motion vectors to improve the accuracy of the technique.<br>

in the art from the following detailed description. It is to be understood, however, that the detailed description and specific examples, while indicating preferred embodiments, are given by way of illustration and not limitation. Many changes and modifications within the scope of the embodiments may be made without departing from the spirit thereof, and should include all such modifications.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0024]	The precision of the motion vector prediction plays a key role in controlling<br>
the following computation reduction steps like early termination, fast search method, and fast mode decision (e. g. skip mode). The method proposes four new methods to improve the creation of motion svector in video codec. In one embodiment, utilizing the spatial correlation between macroblocks, a video frame is first downsampled to create a lower resolution version video frame and motion estimation is performed on this lower resolution video frame. Hence a set of motion vectors, referred to as "coarser" motion vectors, are obtained. The coarser motion vectors are mapped to the original video frame. Thus, the motion vectors of all neighboring blocks, including the coarser motion vector (derived from the lower resolution video frames) and the causal motion vectors can be utilized as motion vector candidates. In another embodiment, the metadata information fed to the video codec from the upstream MPEG-2 encoder, which contains the MPEG-2 motion vector information for each macroblock that can be used in predicting the motion vector of the corresponding block, is used. In yet another embodiment, the luminance components are incorporated into calculating the motion vector to fully exploiting the color information. In still yet another embodiment, a motion vector smoothing technique is applied to attempt to correct wrongly predicted motion vectors and remove noise.<br>
1. Non-causal motion vectors<br>
[0025]	FIG. 5 illustrates the use of non-causal motion vectors to predict the motion<br>
vector of a current block 502 of a current frame 500 in a prediction process 600 as shown in the flow diagram of FIG. 6. In contrast to the JVT standard, as noted previously, where only 3 causal blocks are used in the prediction, in one embodiment all of the blocks 504-518 neighboring to current block 502 may be used as candidates for motion vector prediction for all frames in a frame sequence other than where the frame is an intra frame (I frame), as shown in step 602 and step 604. No prediction is performed for I frames because no motion vector prediction is needed for these types of frames. However, for all other frames, motion vectors for all neighboring blocks are made available through the creation of "coarser" motion vectors, as described in the steps below. Thus, when the video frame is not an I frame, the video frame is downsampled to create a lower resolution frame 702, where it is determined if causal<br>
motion vectors are available. Referring to FIG. 5 as an example, casual motion vectors are only available for block 504 (A), block 506 (B), and block 508 (C) and block 510 (H) because block 512 (ยฃ&gt;), block 518 (ยฃ), block 516 (F) and block 514 (G) have not yet been processed pursuant to the scanning order. Thus, operation will continue with step 608, where video frame 500 is downsampled to create lower resolution frame 702, as shown in FIG. 7. Then, motion estimation is performed on lower resolution video frame 702, in step 608, to derive a set of motion vectors, referred to as a set of "coarser" motion vectors, which is then mapped back to the original video frame in step 610 and illustrated in FIG. 7.<br>
[0026J	Thus, motion vector prediction may be performed in step 612, even when<br>
causal motion vectors are not available as the coarser motion vectors may be used. For example, referring to FIG. 6, in one embodiment the prediction for current block 502 is performed using the pattern in the current standard for the causal motion vectors, where only block 510 (H), block 506 (#), and block 508 (C) are used for the prediction, but additional vectors as derived from the non-causal blocks (i.e., the coarser motion vectors from ) are also used. Specifically, the values set for the three motion vectors for block 510 (H), block 506 (5), and block 508 (C) are determined as follows:<br>
[0027]	1, If H is not available (lies outside of the picture), its MV is set to (0, 0).<br>
[0028]	2. If C is not available, its MV is set to A.<br>
[0029]	3. If both E and C are not available, both MVs are set to (0, 0).<br>
[0030] These motion vectors are combined with the coarser motion vectors from block 512 (D), block 518 (E), block 516 (F) and block 514 (G) for the median predictor.<br>
[0031]	In another embodiment, the reference blocks used will include all blocks<br>
(i.e., block 504 (A), block 506 (B), block 508 (C), block 512 (D), block 518 (E), block 516 (F) and block 514 (G), and block 510 (H)). Then, the median predictor is calculated as:<br>
 [0033] where mv_PrevCurrent is defined as the motion vector of the corresponding block in the previous reference frame.<br>
2. Motion Vector Information from the Metadata of an MPEG-2 Up Stream<br>
[0034]	FIG. 8 illustrates a dataflow of a video transmission system 800, where the<br>
video data source fed into a video codec 806 is transmitted from a decoded MPEG-2<br>
video stream from a MPEG-2 decoder 802. In one embodiment, all original source<br>
video data is transmitted as a MPEG-2 stream and then decoded. The decoded raw<br>
video data is further processed and down-scaled to a quarter VGA (QVGA) size by a<br>
preprocessor 804 and presented to video codec 806 for encoding into a new format, such<br>
as H.264. Video codec 806 also receives such MPEG-2 metadata as frame size, frame<br>
rate, macroblock type and a motion vector of each macroblock. The MPEG-2 motion<br>
vectors are thus used by video codec 806 in one embodiment as a motion vector<br>
prediction candidate of the corresponding macroblock during the encoding process. In<br>
one embodiment, where the size of the macroblock is a block size of 16x16, the MPEG-<br>
2 motion vector is also regarded as the up-layer motion vector for all sub-layer blocks.<br>
[0035]	In one embodiment, the concept of using the metadata from a previous<br>
format to a new format applies only to transcoding scenarios where coding parameters and side information from input format decoding is utilizable in a target encoder such as video codec 806. Further, as the motion vector is predicted from the previous frame for both P and B frames, it is only appropriate to predict the motion vector from the metadata for an immediately sequential future frame. As shown in FIG. 9, the motion vector in sequence at time t-1 is only used to predict the motion vector of the corresponding block sequence at time t. In one embodiment, the reference frame number of the current frame is used to locate the motion vector associated with the metadata of the previous reference frame.<br>
3. Color Motion Estimation<br>
[0036]	In current video codec standards such as MPEG-4 and H.264, the motion<br>
vector of both chrominance components (Cb and Cr) are derived from corresponding luminance component (Y). The chrominance components are then omitted in rate-distortion (RD) and motion vector prediction processes due to the assumption that the luminance component can provide sufficient information and no additional overhead is required to predict the chrominance. However, for video sequences that have low luminance or detailed color information, the chrominance components are useful for more accurate motion vector prediction. Thus, in one embodiment, the motion estimation uses the luminance component and both chrominance components. For example, when the chroma information is taken out in a video frame that has objects with rich color information, the motion of the objects will be harder to predict. Thus, a<br>
predicted video frame using color motion prediction will most likely have fewer<br>
artifacts than one predicted with only luma component motion prediction.<br>
[00371	As shown in FIG. 10, the chrominance components are half-sampled to the<br>
horizontal and vertical coordinate compared to the luminance component. If only frame coding is considered, the motion vector of the chrominance component is calculated as follow:<br>
MVr    X=V-2*MV,    X<br>
t.    โ	L,   โ '<br>
_	_Y<br>
[0038]<br>
[0039] where (MV/.JC MVi_Y) is the luma motion vector and (MVC_X, MVC_Y) is the chroma motion vector. In one embodiment, the chroma motion vector is used to compute the sum of absolute differences (SAD) for the chroma motion vector that is incorporated into the motion vector prediction and RD optimization. The RD optimization equation for the luma-only is:<br>
[0040]	L^R+AD<br>
[0041] The motion prediction therefore can be viewed as minimizing this Lagrangian cost<br>
function. Here the distortion D represents the prediction error measured as SAD of the luminance component, R is the number of bits, the Langrangian multiplier is associated with the quantization parameter (QP) and its value controls the RD trade-off. Considering the chrominance components, the following cost function is introduced:<br>
L = R + A(W*D, + W*Dr)<br>
[0042]	:	c'<br>
Wie(l,2), W2e(0,l)<br>
[0043] in which DI and DC represent the distortion in the luma and chroma component<br>
respectively, Wj and W2 are experimental weighted parameters that are adaptive to specific video sequences.   In one embodiment, because the chroma component has less information, its SAD calculation only uses the integer valued motion vector and therefore no interpolation is necessary.<br>
4. Motion Vector Smoothing<br>
[0044]	Any noise or lost frames that is encountered during the video capture and<br>
transmission of an encoded video sequence usually translates to a reduction in quality of the sequence during playback. In addition, the block matching motion vector prediction process also introduces errors in motion vector prediction. Vector median filtering (VMF) may be applied as another effective approach to improve motion vector<br>
prediction accuracy and reduce noise, while preserving video sequence details. The basic idea behind VMF is that neighboring motion vectors in natural video sequences are always correlated with each other. As illustrated in FIG. 11, three types of motion vector fields may appear after the motion vector prediction process, including a smooth region motion vector field 1110, an outlier motion vector 1122 in a motion vector field 1120, and a motion vector field 1130 showing an object edge defined by a plurality of motion vectors 1132(a)-(c) that have a direction opposite the direction of the other motion vectors in motion vector field 1130.<br>
[0045]	In one embodiment, a block size of 3x3 is selected to perform the median<br>
operation. Continuing to refer to FIG. 11, a "wrong" (or outlier) motion vector can be<br>
corrected in the outlier motion vector field 1120. However, VMF cannot be used when<br>
an object boundary occurs inside the block, such as in motion vector field 1130. In one<br>
embodiment, edge detection and object segmentation methods may be used to address<br>
this situation.<br>
[0046]	Each of the proposed motion vector prediction methods can be used<br>
independently or in combined. For example, in one embodiment, during transcoding<br>
the motion vector data available in the input video bitstream is extracted and saved for<br>
use in a target encoder, such as video codec 806. This data pertains to the incoming<br>
video frames. Motion vector data is remapped to the source frames input to the target<br>
encoder. In the process where a single reference frame is used, the motion vector data<br>
over previous N frames can be modeled to find the motion trajectory over these N<br>
frames. Motion vector smoothing can then be applied to remove outliers and improve<br>
the accuracy of the trajectory. Extrapolating the trajectory results in a more accurate<br>
estimate of the motion vector for the block to be encoded. In addition, the motion<br>
vector data extracted from the input video bitstream may or may not be the true motion<br>
vectors. The accuracy of these motion vectors typically depends on the motion search<br>
algorithm used in the upstream source encoder. Deriving the motion field of each<br>
decoded frame based on these motion vectors and applying a suitable motion vector<br>
smoothing technique will help eliminate outliers. When the accuracy of a motion vector<br>
cannot be ascertained, other methods, such as those based on motion vectors of spatial<br>
neighbors or collocated neighbors, can be adopted.<br>
[0047]	If sufficient information is available to enable more than one of the<br>
proposed methods, the following prioritizations in deriving the motion vector estimation are proposed:<br><br>
 [0048]       1. Rank the accuracy of each method (e.g., using a range from 0-1) based on the<br>
additional information available from metadata or pre-processing functions. For example, if de-interlacing or inverse telecine was used as part of pre-processing, the motion vector data needs to be mapped appropriately. If the result of motion vector smoothing is ambiguous, the accuracy of this method is poor. If extracted motion vector, motion vector smoothed motion vector and pre-processed and remapped motion vector are close, the accuracy of this estimate of motion vector is high. Further, for chroma motion estimation, the accuracy depends on the proportion of chroma information relative to the luma information in the source content. When possible, non-causal and causal motion vectors from all reference frames are to be used.<br>
[0049]       2. Apply weights to each method based on its rank.<br>
[0050]       3. Apply a non-linear selection algorithm to select the method.<br>
[0051]	The above-described additions to a video codec attempts to improve the<br>
accuracy of the motion vector prediction process. Although computation is involved in the implementation of each method, the improvement of the accuracy of the motion vector prediction will reduce computation in the pixel search step, SAD calculation and RD optimization. Thus, the total encoding time will be reduced and better video quality will be achieved.<br>
[0052]	FIG. 12 shows a block diagram of an access terminal 1202x and an access<br>
point 1204x in a wireless system, each of which may implement the motion vector prediction process described herein. An "access terminal," as discussed herein, refers to a device providing voice and/or data connectivity to a user. The access terminal may be connected to a computing device such as a laptop computer or desktop computer, or it may be a self contained device such as a personal digital assistant. The access terminal can also be referred to as a subscriber unit, mobile station, mobile, remote station, remote terminal, user terminal, user agent, or user equipment. The access terminal may be a subscriber station, wireless device, cellular telephone, PCS telephone, a cordless telephone, a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) phone, a wireless local loop (WLL) station, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a handheld device having wireless connection capability, or other processing device connected to a wireless modem.  An "access point," as discussed herein, refers to a device in an access network that communicates over the air-interface, through one or more sectors, with the access terminals. The access point acts as a router between the access terminal and the rest of<br><br>
the access network, which may include an IP network, by converting received air-<br>
interface frames to IP packets. The access point also coordinates the management of<br>
attributes for the air interface.<br>
|0053]	For the reverse link, at access terminal 1202x, a transmit (TX) data<br>
processor 1214 receives traffic data from a data buffer 1212, processes (e.g., encodes, interleaves, and symbol maps) each data packet based on a selected coding and modulation scheme, and provides data symbols. A data symbol is a modulation symbol for data, and a pilot symbol is a modulation symbol for pilot (which is known a priori). A modulator 1216 receives the data symbols, pilot symbols, and possibly signaling for the reverse link, performs (e.g., OFDM) modulation and/or other processing as specified by the system, and provides a stream of output chips. A transmitter unit (TMTR) 1218 processes (e.g., converts to analog, filters, amplifies, and frequency upconverts) the output chip stream and generates a modulated signal, which is transmitted from an antenna 1220.<br>
[0054]	At access point 1204x, the modulated signals transmitted by access terminal<br>
1202x and other terminals in communication with access point 1204x are received by an antenna 1252. A receiver unit (RCVR) 1254 processes (e.g., conditions and digitizes) the received signal from antenna 1252 and provides received samples. A demodulator (Demod) 1256 processes (e.g., demodulates and detects) the received samples and provides detected data symbols, which are noisy estimate of the data symbols transmitted by the terminals to access point 1204x. A receive (RX) data processor 1258 processes (e.g., symbol demaps, deinterleaves, and decodes) the detected data symbols for each terminal and provides decoded data for that terminal.<br>
[0055]	For the forward link, at access point 1204x, traffic data is processed by a TX<br>
data processor 1260 to generate data symbols. A modulator 1262 receives the data symbols, pilot symbols, and signaling for the forward link, performs (e.g., OFDM) modulation and/or other pertinent processing, and provides an output chip stream, which is further conditioned by a transmitter unit 1264 and transmitted from antenna 1252. The forward link signaling may include power control commands generated by a controller 1270 for all terminals transmitting on the reverse link to access point 1204x. At access terminal 1202x, the modulated signal transmitted by access point 1204x is received by antenna 1220, conditioned and digitized by a receiver unit 1222, and processed by a demodulator 1224 to obtain detected data symbols. An RX data processor 1226 processes the detected data symbols and provides decoded data for the<br><br>
terminal and the forward link signaling. Controller 1230 receives the power control commands, and controls data transmission and transmit power on the reverse link to access point 1204x. Controllers 1230 and 1270 direct the operation of access terminal 1202x and access point 1204x, respectively. Memory units 1232 and 1272 store program codes and data used by controllers 1230 and 1270, respectively.<br>
