Calender rollers for supplying a lap sheet<br>
The invention relates to a device and/or to a method for supplying a lap sheet to a succeeding device for the processing of the lap sheet with at least two successively arranged, driven calender rollers, whereby respective neighbouring calender rollers together form a clamping point, between which the lap sheet is led curvilinear through and whereby said web is led on a partial section of the circumference of the respective calender roller.<br>
In the published EP-A1-141 258 such calender rollers are shown, over which a lap sheet is led curvilinear to a following winding device. During operation the individual calender rollers are pressed against each other by means of spring elements, whereby between two neighbouring calender rollers a clamping line results, within which the passing lap sheet is condensed. This condensing is necessary for the following winding-up procedure of the lap sheet onto a lap roll, and/or for the following re-unwinding in a succeeding processing step on a combing machine. The calender rollers are connected with a drive means.<br>
Since the calender rollers are positioned within the machine, and/or essentially enclosed by casings of the machine, the manual threading of the end of a new lap sheet in between the calender rollers and transferring the lap sheet up to the following device for the further processing is relatively intensive work, this in particular as a result of the difficult accessibility. With a special device for threading the lap sheet, which is e.g. shown and described in the EP-A1-345 558, a suggestion is disclosed to facilitate the threading and/or threading of a new lap sheet. It was partly possible to facilitate the threading procedure of the lap sheet with this device. However, false drawing-ins have resulted again and again when the drawing-in auxiliary device was inappropriately applied. In addition this drawing-in auxiliary device had to be removed again manually as soon as the lap sheet had passed through between the second and the third calender roller. The taking-off of the end of the lap sheet and the transfer to the fourth calender roller again had to be performed manually.<br><br>
Thus the object of the invention is based on the task to suggest a device and/or a method by which a new end of a lap sheet can be introduced fully automatically between the succeeding calender rollers and be transferred to a succeeding device for the processing of the lap sheet.<br>
This task is solved for one part in that at least one of the calender rollers is provided with openings, distributed across the width and along their circumference, said openings leading into a hollow space within the calender roller and that means are provided, in order to connect this hollow space with a source for a vacuum. With this device it is possible to hold the lap sheet during the threading procedure on the section of circumference of the calender roller on which it is guided during its passage, due to the applied vacuum (sub-pressure) within the calender roller. This is in particular necessary with the calender rollers by which the lap sheet is guided on the lower section of the circumference of the calender roller during its passage and thus exposing it to the force of gravity. For the calender rollers where the lap sheet is guided on the upper section of the circumference, it is not to be regarded necessary to hold them down onto the surface by a vacuum, since the lap sheet, due to the force of gravity, is automatically held down on it.<br>
In order to control the suction force, and/or the connection or disconnection of the source of vacuum during and/or after the threading procedure, it is suggested that the source of vacuum is connected with a control unit. It is, however, also conceivable that control means e.g. valves, which are positioned between the source of vacuum and the hollow space of the calender roller, can be triggered directly by the control unit. With this device it is possible, on the basis of the threading speed, to perform a specifically controlled connection and/or disconnection of the vacuum during the threading procedure of the end of the lap sheet. If several successively following calender rollers are provided with such openings on their outer circumference, then the vacuum can be switched off gradually at those calender rollers, e.g. by way of the control unit, around which the end of the lap sheet has already been guided. Depending upon the position of the end of the lap sheet, the intensity of the vacuum can also be controlled gradually.<br><br>
It is suggested that the calender rollers are preferably provided with openings, around which the lap sheet is guided on their lower section. In order to ensure the curvilinear passing through of the lap sheet between the calender rollers, it is suggested that covers are provided within the hollow space of the calender rollers which are being acted upon with vacuum, in order to seal against that section of the circumferential area from the source of vacuum on which no lap sheet is guided. Thus it is ensured that the end of the lap sheet at the transition between the calender rollers is safely transferred over to the following calender roller. A taking along of the end of the lap sheet over the whole periphery of the circumference of a calender roller is thus excluded.<br>
The device for the processing of the lap sheet can be e.g. a winding device for the formation of a lap rolls. It would be possible to deliver a lap sheet directly to a following combing device by means of calender rollers.<br>
Likewise the task of the invention is also solved by the characteristic part of the method according to claim 8, whereby, at least with those calender rollers by which the lap sheet - seen in vertical direction - is led on a circumference section below the calender roller, that, at least, within the zone of the lap guidance, a vacuum is generated by which the lap sheet is held on the calender roller within the guiding zone. Preferably the intensity and/or duration of the vacuum can be controlled.<br>
Preferably the vacuum being applied by the source of vacuum is maintained only during a pre-determined time interval, that is, until the lap sheet is taken-over by the following device for further processing. This procedure is for instance controlled by means of a control unit to which, by means of a respective sensor means, the position of the end of the lap sheet and/or the progress of the threading procedure can be conveyed.<br>
Further advantages of the invention are shown and described in more detail by way of the following exemplified embodiments, wherein show:<br>
Figure 1       a schematic side view of a winding device, with lined up calender rollers, for the automatic supply of a lap sheet;<br><br>
Figure 2       an enlarged illustration of the calender rollers according to figure 1 of the device claimed according to the invention.<br>
Figure 3       a sectional view A-A according to figure 2;<br>
Figure 4       an exemplified embodiment of the calender roller provided with openings according to figure 2 with a bulkhead (partition);<br>
Figure 1 shows a winding device 1 which was already shown and described in detail, in a similar form, in the previously published EP-A1-929 705. Therefore in the following description only a rudimentary description of the working principle of this winding device is given. With the winding device 1 shown, a lap roll WW is produced by means of a belt R. The belt R is thereby led over fixedly or pivotally mounted rollers R1-R6, whereby said belt forms a loop between the rollers R1 and R2 around a fixedly arranged rotary axis AX. For the production of a lap roll WW, by way of the calender rollers K1 to K4, a lap sheet W is supplied into the loop S onto the circumference of a sleeve H between the two rollers R1 and R2. During the winding procedure the sleeve H is clamped between two winding disks not shown. During an increase of the lap WW the loop S becomes larger for so long, until the lap WW has reached a desired size. The arrival at the desired winding diameter is determined either directly by suitable sensors at the circumference of the laps or indirectly by detecting the supplied lap sheet length. During the winding procedure the displacement of the belt, and/or the controlling of the belt tension force is performed by means of a tensioning device 3 which is controllably moved by a cylinder Z. By means of the tensioning device 3, a tensioning roller R6 is pivoted around a shaft 4. During the winding-up procedure the lap roll WW rotates in the direction of rotation D. Shortly before the end of the winding procedure the drive means of the calender rollers K1-K4 is stopped, while the drive means of the lap roll WW is still in operation by way of the belt R. This way the lap is separated in the zone of the guiding sheet metal 6. As soon as the separation process is finished, the winding device 1 is stopped. By means of the arm 8 which is pivotable around the shaft AX, the roller R2 is pivoted downwards, whereby also the roller R3 is pivoted downwards by means of the arm 9. With the help of the tensioning device 3, the belt R is further tensioned and<br><br>
the not shown discharge of the finished lap rolls WW onto a take-over means is performed. After the discharge procedure, after rearward pivoting the rollers R2, R3 into their position shown in figure 1 and, after a new sleeve H was introduced, a new winding procedure is being started. In connection with this, the calender rollers K1-K4 are again put in motion by a not further shown drive means. Likewise, by way of the drive means not shown, one of the rollers R1-R6 of the belt R and thus the winding device is set in motion, so that a new lap can be formed.<br>
As long as the calender rollers K1-K4 are supplied with a lap sheet W, the described process of the lap formation can take place continuously. However, if an interruption takes place in the supply of the lap sheet, e.g. if the material supply runs out or during a change of the material which is to be processed, then it is necessary to thread a new end of a lap sheet between the calender rollers K1-K4. Before the new lap is supplied, the still present lap roll WW should be discharged from the loop S and the winding device should be prepared for the formation of a the new lap roll.<br>
The supply of the new lap sheet W to the calender rollers K1-K4 takes place by means of a guiding sheet metal 11, to which a sensor 13 is assigned above it. The guiding sheet metal 11 could for example also be provided as a driven conveyer belt, in order to supply the lap sheet W automatically to the rear calender roller K1. The lap sheet W is for instance supplied from upstream arranged drafting units in which a multiplicity of supplied sliver are processed into a lap sheet, and/or into a lap sheet W. Such an embodiment is disclosed in the EP-A1-679 740, whereby in place of the belt, winding rollers are provided, above which the lap is formed.<br>
In figure 1 it is schematically shown that the hollow space of the calender roller K2 and/or K4 is connected to a vacuum source P by means of a valve 15 and/or 16 vacuum source P. The vacuum sources P are connected with the valves 15, 16 by the lines 17, 18. The vacuum sources P are controlled via the lines 20, 21 by means of a control unit ST and the valves 15, 16, for their control, are connected with the control unit ST via the lines 34, 35. The valves 15, 16 are connected with a hole 26, via the line 23 and/or 24. The hole 26 (figure 3) is positioned in the centre of a rotary axis 30, on<br><br>
which the calender roller K2 and/or K4 is fixedly connected. For clarity reasons, in the enlarged illustration of figure 2, only the calender roller K2 is shown with the device being claimed according to the invention. However, as described in connection with figure 1, the calender roller K4 can also be furnished with such a device. The calender rollers K1 and K3, in the example shown, are not provided with such a device, since the lap sheet rests on the upper side of these two rollers during their passage and, therefore, no problems are to be expected with the threading procedure. However, it is not to be excluded, that also these calender rollers K1 and/or K3 are being provided with such a device, if thereby a still more effective threading of the end of the lap sheet could be achieved.<br>
The hole 26 shows approximately in the centre of the calender roller K2 an exhaust port 31 adjusted radially outward, which leads into a closed hollow space 33 of the calender roller K2. The hollow space 33 is connected with the ambient air in the spinning mill through the openings L which are provided in the casing along the circumference U and across the width B of the calender roller K2. The openings L can be evenly distributed over the circumferential surface U or they present a suitable pattern in their distribution. The passages of the individual openings L can also be different. This depends on their position with regard of the exhaust port 31. It would also be conceivable to extend the hole 26 nearly across the total length of the rotary axis 30, whereby - distributed across the length - also several exhaust ports 31 can be provided. Finally, the position and size of the exhaust port 31, and/or the number of exhaust ports 31, as well as the position and the size of the openings L must be co-ordinated in such a manner that the retaining force for the lap sheet W is approximately even throughout the entire width B. The number of openings L, which are arranged across the width B of the calender roller K2, is also to be co-ordinated in such a way that a sufficient retaining force can be achieved for the lap sheet W. In figure 3 the rotary axis 30 is supported in the bearings 36 and/or 37, which are connected with a drive means AT which is shown schematically. The drive can take place by means of gears or chain transmission. Such a drive means was already shown in the EP-A1-922 127. The line 23, as is shown schematically, is connected with the rotary axis 30 by way of a coupling 28. This coupling 28 ensures that the line 23 follows the rotary motion of the calender roller K2 during operation. In order<br><br>
to be able to control the threading procedure, and/or the generation of a vacuum at the calender roller K2, the control unit ST (figure 2) is connected with a sensor 40 via a line 39, said sensor is positioned on the rotary axis 42 of the calender roller K1 and which detects the rotary motion of this roller. With this sensor 40, by way of the determined rotary motion in connection with the known diameter of the calender roller K1, the distance of transportation of the lap sheet W can be determined in the control unit ST. By means of the sensor 13 and the line 14 the control unit ST receives a signal as soon as the end of the lap sheet is within the zone above the guiding sheet metal 11 for threading. The threading procedure then takes place as follows:<br>
The end of the lap sheet W is led manually or automatically, by way of respective conveyance means, into the zone of the sensor 13 above the guiding sheet metal 11, until the end of the lap sheet is positioned within the zone of the clamping line 44 between the two calender rollers K1 and K2. By means of the sensor 13 the control unit ST receives a signal that a end of the lap sheet is present. Now, by means of the control unit ST the vacuum source P, and/or the valve 15 is triggered, whereby, by way of the lines 17, 23 and/or the hole 26 with the exhaust port 31, a vacuum is being generated in the hollow space 33 of the calender roller K2. By means of this an airflow results through the openings L, as indicated by arrows, from the ambient air of the calender roller K2. As soon as the vacuum is generated, the drive means of the calender rollers K1-K4 is put into motion, whereby the lap sheet W is transported over the clamping line 44 to the following clamping line 45 between the calender rollers K2 and K3. Along this way, between the clamping lines 44 and 45, the lap sheet W is held by the openings L through the vacuum that has been generated in the hollow space 33 on the outer surface of the circumference U of the calender roller K2. After the end of the lap sheet has passed between the clamping line 45, the end of the lap sheet arrives on the casing surface of the calender roller K3 and is conveyed farther to the following clamping line 46 between the calender rollers K3 and K4. Subsequently, the end of the lap sheet of the lap W arrives at the guiding sheet metal 6 and by means of this it is inserted into the succeeding winding device 1 into the loop S. Now the winding-up procedure can be started as has been described before.<br><br>
As soon as the end of the lap sheet is positioned within the clamping line 4t) aner ine passage of the lap sheet W, then, by means of the control unit ST, the vacuum source P is stopped, and/or the valve 15 is closed. This distance, from the clamping line 44 up to the clamping line 45, which the end of the lap sheet travels, is detected by way of sensing the rotary motion of the calender roller K1 with the sensor 40, which transmits the signals by means of the line 39 to the control unit ST. The end of the lap sheet is then, as described above, led along the casing surface of the calender roller K3 into the clamping line 46 and from there, by means of the guiding sheet metal 6, into the loop S. The threading procedure is now finished and the lap formation can be started.<br>
In order to avoid false routings of the lap sheet W, there is, in accordance with the exemplified embodiment of figure 4, a sheet metal 51 attached within the hollow space 33 of the calender roller K2, said sheet metal extends across the entire free inside diameter of the calender roller K2, and at its outer ends it is provided with sealing lips 52 which form a sealing contact against the turning calender roller. The sheet metal 51 is fixedly connected with a stationary shaft 30a, whereby the shaft 30a is provided with a hole 26 according to the embodiment shown in figure 3. The sheet metal 51 is also provided with sealing lips at its front faces, said lips rest in sealing contact on the inside of the flanges 48, 49 of the calender roller K2. With this arrangement of the stationary shaft 30a, another bearing is necessary for the calender roller K2 than the one that is being shown in figure 3, That means, the calender roller K2 is now rotatable mounted on the stationary shaft 30a by means of not further shown bearing units. With the shown arrangement the upper hollow space 33a of the calender roller K2 is partitioned from the hollow space 33, thereby, within the circumferential area of the hollow space 33a, no vacuum is present at the circulating openings L. This vacuum is only generated within the hollow space 33 which faces the circumferential area U of the calender roller K2, on which the lap sheet W is led. With this device it is prevented that, after the lap sheet passes through the clamping line 45, due to the existing vacuum, said lap sheet can lay itself completely around the calender roller K2 and lead to a not desired winding up. This winding-up risk can also be eliminated, however, in that, shortly after the passage of the end of the lap sheet through the clamping line 45, the application of vacuum in<br><br>
the hollow space of the calender roller K2 is interrupted by means of the control unit ST, as was already described before.<br>
There are still further embodiments conceivable, in particular regarding the partitioning possibilities of the circumferential sections, which are not intended for lap sheet guiding.<br>
With the suggested device, a safe and easy to use device is made available for a threading possibility of a new end of the lap sheet. Such calender rollers can also serve for the supply in connection with winding devices, whereby the lap roll is formed above two winding rollers. Likewise such calender rollers of the claimed innovation are also applicable with other machines which are designed for the processing of a lap sheet. This can for instance be a combing part of a combing machine, which is submitted with a lap sheet for combing.<br><br><br><br><br>
