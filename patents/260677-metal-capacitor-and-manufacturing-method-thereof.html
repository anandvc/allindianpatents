5<br><br>
As shown in FIG. 4B, the metal member 11 is formed with a groove forming portion 11a that is provided by arranging a plurality of grooves 11d on its both surfaces. An electrode withdrawing portion 11b and a sealing portion 11c are formed in one end and another end of the groove forming portion 11a. When the electrode withdrawing portion 11b is formed in the one end of the groove forming portion 11a and the sealing portion 11c is formed in the other end of the groove forming portion 11a to face the electrode withdrawing portion 11b. The groove forming portion 11a, and the electrode withdrawing portion 11b and the sealing portion 11c that are formed in the one end and the other end of the groove forming portion 11a are integrally formed on the metal member 11. The metal member where the groove forming portion 11a, the electrode withdrawing portion 11b, and the sealing portion 11c are integrally formed uses any one of aluminum (Al), niobium (Nb), tantalum (Ta), titanium (Ti), and zirconium (Zr). The plurality of grooves 11d that is formed in the groove forming portion 11a of the metal member 11 using various types of metal materials is formed in a cylindrical shape to readily form the grooves 11d.<br>
The metal oxide layer 12 is formed on the metal member 11, and uses any one of alumina(AI203), niobium rnonoxide(NbO), niobium pentoxide(Nb205), tantalum pentoxide(Ta205), titanium dioxide(Ti02) , and zirconium dioxide(Zr02) according to the material of the metal member 11. When forming the metal oxide layer 12, the metal oxide layer 12 is formed on the metal member 10, that is, on the whole surface of the metal member 10 that includes a surface where the grooves 11d are formed and a side 11e.<br>
The insulating layer 15 is formed on the metal member 11 along the side 11e of the metal member 11 as shown in FIGS. 1 and 4D, so that the plurality of grooves 11d and the electrode withdrawing portion 11b of the metal member may be externally exposed. The insulating layer 15 can be formed after forming a plurality of main electrode layers 14. The insulating layer 15 is formed on all the remaining side 11e of the metal member 11, excluding the surface where the plurality of grooves 11d is formed. In this instance, the he electrode withdrawing portion 11b is formed to be externally exposed and the insulating layer 15 is formed of insulating tape or resin type material.<br>
6<br><br>
The plurality of seed electrode layers 13 is formed on the metal oxide layer 12 that is formed in the groove forming portion 11a of the metal member 11, so that the main electrode layer 14 may be filled in the surface of the plurality of grooves 11d and be formed. The seed electrode layer 13 may be removed and not be applied depending on requirement of the user.<br>
The plurality of main electrode layers 14 is formed on the plurality of seed electrode layers formed on both surfaces of the groove forming portion 11a to fill in the plurality of grooves 11 d formed on the groove forming portion 11 a of the metal member 11. The conductive connecting layer 16 is formed on the plurality of main electrode layers 14 and the insulating layer 15 to face the electrode withdrawing portion 11b of the metal member 11 and connect the plurality of main electrode layers 14. The conductive connecting layer 16 that is conductively connected to the plurality of main electrode layers 14 is formed on the opposite surface of the electrode withdrawing portion 11b to face the electrode withdrawing portion 11b.<br>
Each of the conductive connecting layer 16 connecting the plurality of main electrode layers 14, the seed electrode layer 13, and the main electrode layer uses any one of aluminum (Al), copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), silver (Ag), nickel (Ni), tin (Sn), indium (in), palladium (Pd), platinum (Pt), cobalt (Co), ruthenium (Ru), and gold (Au). The first lead terminal 21 is connected to the electrode withdrawing portion 11b of the metal member 11. In this case, the first lead terminal 21 may connect the electrode withdrawing portion 11b and the metal oxide layer 12 formed on the electrode withdrawing portion 11b, or may connect the metal oxide layer 12 and the electrode withdrawing portion 11b after removing a part to be connected to the first lead terminal 21. When the first lead terminal 21 is connected, the second lead terminal is connected to the main electrode layer 14. Through this, the non-polar metal capacitor 10 is constructed.<br>
In order to more readily connect the second lead terminal 22 to the main electrode layers 14, one of the main electrode layers 14 further include a conductive adhesive layer 17 for connecting the second lead terminal 22. The conductive adhesive layer 17 is formed using conductive epoxy or plating. The sealing member 30 seals the metal member 11 connected to the first and the second lead terminals 21 and 22, so that the<br>
7<br><br>
first and the second lead terminals 21 and 22 may be externally exposed. The sealing member 30 uses EMC molding material or a cover member with an empty inside. Hereinafter, a manufacturing method of the metal capacitor 10 according to the first embodiment   of  the   present   invention   will   be   described   with   reference   to   the accompanying drawings.<br>
As shown in FIGS. 4A and 4B, when a member 1 such as layer, foil, etc., of a metal material is provided, the groove forming portion 11a where the plurality of grooves 11d is arranged on both surfaces of the member 1 is formed and thereby the metal member 11 integrally formed with the electrode withdrawing portion 11b and the sealing portion 11c on one end and the other end is formed by a DC(Direct Current) etching. The DC etching performs a pre-processing process for the member 1 in an aqueous solution with about 1% of phosphoric acid in the temperature of about 50°C during about one minutes, and performs first etching in the mixture of sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, aluminum, etc. in the temperature of about 70 °C through 90 °C during about two minutes. In this case, the current density is about 100 mA/cm2 through 400 mA/cm2. The DC etching performs second etching in the mixture of nitric acid, phosphoric acid, aluminum, etc., in the temperature of about 80 °C during five through ten minutes. In this case, the current density is about 10 mA/cm2 through 100 mA/cm2. When the first etching and the second etching are completed, chemical cleaning is performed in the solution of nitric acid 30 g through 70 g/l in the temperature of about 60 °C through 70 °C during about ten minutes. In case of the etching, etching structures are very simple and uniform and thus applies completely plating up to an inner end of the grooves. The plurality of grooves 11d formed in the groove forming portion 11a is formed in the shape of a circle or a polygon and has a diameter of about 1 urn through about 100 um. When the thickness of the metal member 11 is 1 um, the depth of the metal member 10 is formed to be less than about 0.5 um.<br>
As shown in FIG. 4C, when the groove forming portion 11a, the electrode withdrawing portion 11b, and the sealing portion 11c are integrally formed on the metal member 11, a forming process of forming the metal oxide layer 12 on the metal member 11 by using an anodizing method is performed.<br>
8<br><br>
The anodizing method initially performs a boiling process in the temperature of about 80°C through 100 °C during one through fifteen minutes in a deionized water, proceeds first oxidation in an aqueous solution of boric acid and boric acid-ammonium with 120 through 150 voltages, and proceeds a plurality of, two or three times of oxidations with changing the concentration and the voltage of the aqueous solution. The anodizing method performs a thermal treatment in the predetermined temperature, for example, in the temperature of 400°C through 600 °C to perform a reforming process. Also, the anodizing method proceeds a by-product treatment in order to disposal and remove the by-product generated in the reforming process. Also, the anodizing method repeats the reforming process and the thermal treatment and proceeds a predetermined cleaning process in order to clean boric acid or phosphoric acid.<br>
As shown in FIG. 4D, a through type metal member 10a is formed by forming the insulating layer 15 on the main electrode layer 14 and/or the metal member 11 by using a CVD(Chemical Vapor Deposition), so that the electrode withdrawing portion 11b of the metal member 11 may be externally exposed. Although the CVD is used herein, it is possible to apply any one of dipping process using an insulating resin or insulating ink, a spray process using ink-jet printing or screen printing, and a stamping process. As shown in FIG. 4E, the plurality of seed electrode layers 13 is formed on the metal oxide layer 12 that is formed in the groove forming portion 11a to be penetrated into the metal oxide layer 12 by using an electroless plating or an electroplating. However, the seed electrode layer 13 may be removed and not be applied depending on requirement of the user.<br>
The manufacturing method deposits a predetermined amount of palladium sulfate aqueous solution as an activator during 10 through 300 seconds in the seed electrode layer forming process and removes the activator of surface thereof by dipping and cleaning during one through thirty seconds at the normal temperature. Nickel phosphate aqueous solution applies in the nickel electroless plating and plates during about five through twenty minutes by adjusting pH range (4 through 8 pH) and temperature (50 °C through 80 °C). In this case, the seed electrode layer 13 forms in an inner part of the through-holes 11d. An additional plating process and a dry process less than 100 °C may be performed depending on requirement of a user.<br>
9<br><br>
As shown in FIG. 4F, the plurality of main electrode layers 14 is formed to fill in the plurality of grooves 11d formed in the groove forming portion 11a by using the electroless plating or the electroplating.<br>
In the electroplating for forming the main electrode layer 14, the electroplating method adjusts pH range (1 through 5 pH) and temperature (30 °C through 70 °C) and applies D.C(Direct Current) with current density of 20 through 120 mA/cm2 in sulfuric acid nickel aqueous solution or nickel chloride aqueous solution.<br>
In the electroless plating for forming the main electrode layer 14, the electroless plating method adjusts pH range (5 through 7 pH) and temperature (70 °C through 90 °C) and proceeds material having seed electrode layer 13 during about ten through thirty minutes and removes plating solution components of surface thereof by dipping and cleaning during one through thirty seconds at the normal temperature. As shown in FIGS. 4G and 4H, when the plurality of main electrode layers 14 is formed, a non-through type metal member 10a is formed by forming the insulating layer 15 on the plurality of main electrode layers 14 and the side 11e of the metal member 11 along the side 11e of the metal member 11 by using a CVD method, so that the electrode withdrawing portion 11b of the metal member 11 may be externally exposed. The insulating layer 15 is formed using an insulating tape or a resin material. As shown in FIG. 4H, a conductive connecting layer 16 is formed on the plurality of main electrode layers 14 and the insulating layer 15 to face the electrode withdrawing portion 11b of the metal member 11 in order to connect the plurality of main electrode layers 14. A process of forming a conductive adhesive layer on the main electrode layer 14 connected to the second lead terminal 22 in order to improve the adhesiveness of the first and the second lead terminals 21 and 22 is further provided between the process of forming the conductive connecting layer 14 and the process of connecting the first and the second lead terminals 21 and 22. The method of forming the conductive adhesive layer 17 uses any one of a method of spraying metal adhesives or solder paste, the electroplating, and the electroless plating.<br>
As shown in FIG. 4H, the first and the second lead terminals 21 and 22 are connected to the electrode withdrawing portion 11b of the metal member 11 and each of the main electrode layers 14a. As shown in FIG. 3, when the first and the second lead terminals<br>

of the plurality of non-through type metal members 10a. That is, the first polar lead<br>
terminal 25 is connected to electrode withdrawing portions 11b formed at the plurality of<br>
non-through type metal members 10a located at the left as shown in FIG. 6.<br>
The second lead terminal 26 is connected to one of the main electrode layers 14 of the<br>
plurality of non-through  type  metal  members  10a.  Through  this,  the  polar metal<br>
capacitor 120 is constructed.<br>
In  this  instance,   the  first  polar  lead  terminal  25   is  connected  to  the  electrode<br>
withdrawing portion 11b of the metal member 11 that is formed on the metal oxide layer<br>
12 to be a positive electrode, and thus functions as an anode electrode.   The second<br>
polar lead terminal 26 connected to the main electrode layer 14 not formed on the metal<br>
oxide layer to be a negative electrode and thus functions as a cathode electrode.<br>
12<br><br>
The metal member 11 that includes the electrode withdrawing portion 11b connected to the first polar lead terminal 25 may function as the negative electrode. When the metal member 11 functions as the negative electrode, the main electrode layer 14 functions as the positive electrode. Accordingly, when the second polar lead terminal 26 is applied to the cathode electrode, the first polar lead terminal 25 is applied to the anode electrode. Conversely, when the second polar lead terminal 26 is applied to the anode electrode, the first polar lead terminal 25 is applied to the cathode electrode. Also, when the first polar lead terminal 25 is applied to the cathode electrode, the second polar lead terminal 26 is applied to the anode electrode. Conversely, when the first polar lead terminal 25 is applied to the anode electrode, the second polar lead terminal 26 is applied to the cathode electrode.<br>
The conductive adhesive layer 17 is formed on the main electrode layer 14 connected with the second polar lead terminal 26 that functions as either the cathode electrode or the anode electrode. When the first and the second lead terminals 25 and 26 that function as the anode or the cathode electrode are connected, the sealing member 30 seals the metal member 10a so that the first and the second lead terminals 25 and 26 may be externally exposed.<br>
When constructing the metal capacitors 110 and 120 by disposing the metal capacitors 10, it is possible to obtain a metal capacitor with the high voltage and the high capacity. According to the present invention, it is possible to improve an electric conductivity by about 10,000 to 1,000,000 folds by applying a metal material for an electrolyte, in comparison to when using a conventional electrolyte or an organic semiconductor. Also, since the serial multi-laying is possible, high-voltage is enabled. Also, since the polarity has no directivity, a relatively higher safety is provided. Also, it is possible to improve a miniature, a low equivalent series resistance (ESR), a reduction in a ripple pyrexia, a long life, a heat-resistant stability, non-fuming, non-firing, and environment.
