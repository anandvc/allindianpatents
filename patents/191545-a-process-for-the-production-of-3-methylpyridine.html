				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td> <br><br><br>
The present invention relates to a process for the production of 3-methylpiperidine (MPI) and 3-methylpyridine (PIC) from 2-methyl-l,5-diaminopentane (MPDA).<br>
3-Methylpiperidine is used as a vulcanisation accelerator and as a lubricating oil additive. 3-Methylpyridine is used both as a solvent and as an intermediate in the production of nicotinic acid.<br>
It is known, from PCT application WO 90/00546, that mixtures of 3-methylpiperidine and 3-methylpyridine can be produced from 2-methyl-l,5-diaminopentane by passing the gaseous starting material over a metal oxide catalyst at 500-600°C. Preferred such catalysts include copper chromite, molybdenum oxide and vanadium oxide, which, preferably, are applied to a support. The ratio, between the quantities of piperidine and pyridine produced, may be displaced in favour of one or the other, by varying the reaction temperature. This published patent application also mentions the possibility of using acidic oxides, such as Si02 or silicon-aluminium oxides, as catalysts, without further additives. The yields achieved in this manner, however, are only moderate. No information, concerning long term catalyst activity, is provided.<br>
A process for cyclising di-primary amino and/or hydroxyl-substituted alkanes, using a metalloalumino-silicate molecular sieve as a catalyst, is disclosed in US patent 3,903,079. The metal is, preferably, copper, palladium, manganese, nickel or chromium, and the reaction is performed in the presence of ammonia. The yields achieved are modest; only 75% is achieved in the production of piperidine from 1,5-pentanediol.<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a process for preparing 3-methylpiperidine from 2-methyl-l,5-diaminopentane, which may be performed on a commercial scale and can provide<br><br>
high yields. Catalyst activity should be maintained over extended periods using this process.<br>
Accordingly, in a first aspect, the present invention provides a process, for the production of 3-methylpiperidine, comprising passing gaseous 2-methyl-l,5-diaminopentane over a catalyst, wherein the catalyst includes, as an active component, at least one Al and/or Si oxide, has a ratio of acidic to basic centres greater than 2 on its surface and a specific surface area in excess of 40 m^/g.<br>
The Al and/or Si oxide can comprise the individual oxides, such as AI2O3, a mixed oxide of AlzOs/SiOz, or a crystalline compound comprising Al, Si and 0,, such as an alumino-silicate, and, preferably, is a zeolite.<br>
It is important that the catalyst is of a predominantly acidic nature and has a specific surface area of above 40 m^/g.<br>
This acidic nature results from the ratio of acidic to basic centres on the catalyst's surface being in favour of the acidic and, in accordance with the invention, above 2. The number of acidic centres can be determined by quantifying the irreversible adsorption of NH3 at 80°C and, likewise, the number of basic centres can be determined by observing the irreversible adsorption of CO2 at 80°C.<br>
The preferred catalysts, for the process according to the first aspect of the invention, are activated AI2O3, mixed oxides of Al203/Si02 and zeolites. Zeolites are crystalline natural or synthetic alumino-silicates which have a highly ordered structure consisting of a rigid, three-dimensional   'I'!'" lattice of SiO^ and AlO^ tetrahedrons bond together via common oxygen atoms. The ratio of Si and Al atoms to oxygen is 1:2. Electrical neutrality, within the AlO^ tetrahedrons, is maintained by the inclusion of cations, for example alkali metal or hydrogen ions, in the crystal lattice. Cation<br><br>
exchange is possible. Unless dehydrated, by drying or calcining, the interstices between the tetrahedrons are      ' occupied by water molecules.<br>
Preferably, the zeolite includes hydrogen as a, preferably predominant, cationic species. More preferably the cationic species in the zeolite is exclusively hydrogen. Thus, if, due to the manner in which it is produced, the zeolite is not in the catalytically more active (acidic) form, where the cations are hydrogen, but instead, for example, it has sodium cations, these may be entirely or partially displaced with hydrogen by ion exchange, for example with ammonium ions, and subsequent calcination, or by treatment with an acid.<br>
The catalysts are preferably used as fixed bed catalysts and the educt is conveniently passed through the catalyst using hydrogen or an inert gas, such as nitrogen, as a carrier gas.<br>
The reaction temperature, preferably, is adjusted to 300-400°C, more preferably to 305-375°C. The preferred pressure is 0-10 bar, more preferably 0-5 bar, above atmospheric.<br>
One measure of catalyst loading is the "mass hourly space velocity" (MHSV). In the present case, the MHSV, preferably, is maintained at 2.1-4.2 g of educt per gram of catalyst per hour. The vapour phase starting material can be diluted, preferably, with Nj or Hj.<br>
In a second aspect, the invention provides a process for the production of 3-methylpyridine, comprising preparing 3-methylpiperidine, by a process in accordance with the first aspect of the invention, and then passing said 3-methylpiperidine over a dehydrogenation catalyst. The dehydrogenation process can be a known such process.<br>
A stream of 3-methylpiperidine, produced in accordance with the first aspect of the invention, may be passed directly over<br><br>
the dehydrogenation catalyst, such that dehydrogenation proceeds immediately after cyclisation. MPDA severely impairs ' the activity of dehydrogenation catalysts and this procedure is only possible because the 3-methylpiperidine is produced at an unusually high purity and, in particular, contains virtually no MPDA.<br>
The preferred dehydrogenation catalyst comprises a noble metal, such as Pd or Pt, on a supporting matrix. Such dehydrogenation catalysts can be obtained from silicon-aluminium oxides by ion exchange with soluble palladium complexes such as [Pd(NH3)4]Cl2. Preferably, the amorphous silicon-aluminium oxide is initially dehydrated and then laden with ammonia. Ion exchange with the soluble palladium complex can be achieved by suspending the amorphous oxide in a solution of the complex. Alternatively, a solution of the complex can be passed through a packed bed of the amorphous oxide. However, in contrast with the former method, an even loading is achievable with this second procedure, only when the exchange is complete.<br>
Using the aforementioned methods, it is possible to achieve palladium contents of up to 5 wt.% and higher in a single stage even when using relatively dilute solutions of, for example, 0.01 mol/1 of [Pd{NH3)4 JClz-<br>
The reaction temperature during dehydrogenation is preferably 220-400°C. In an embodiment, the cyclisation catalyst is placed directly on top of the dehydrogenation catalyst and the 2-methyl-l,5-diaminopentane is introduced from above. In a preferred embodiment, the catalysts are located in separate reactors. This allows independent temperature control, optionally together with independent catalyst regeneration.<br>
The following examples are provided by way of illustration only and to assist the reader to better understand the processes according to the invention. All the pressures stated<br><br>
in the examples are not absolute pressures, but relative pressures above atmospheric pressure.<br>
Examples 1-11<br>
The examples of the cyclisation of methyldiaminopentane (MPDA) to methylpiperidine (MPI) listed in table 1 below were performed as follows. Examples 1, 2 and 3 are comparative examples (not according to the invention).<br>
3 g of catalyst (grain size: 0.32-1 mm) were introduced into a reactor (4&gt; 13 mm) . The MPDA was vaporised and passed over the catalyst with a carrier gas stream of 15 ml/min Nj at a pressure of 5 bar. The catalyst bed was heated stepwise and the reaction monitored by gas chromatography. The higher the activity of the catalyst, the lower is the temperature required for the cyclisation of MPDA to MPI. The activities of the catalysts used could be compared on the basis of the temperatures required for the highest possible MPI yield and taking catalyst loading (MHSV) into account.<br>
The table also contains parameters characterising the catalysts which were used.<br><br>

Example 12<br>
MPDA to 3-methylpyridinG.<br>
4g of a Pd catalyst (1% Pd/AlzOj) were introduced into a reactor (4) 13 mm) and 3 g of H-ZSM-5 were introduced on top (The educt was always fed in from the top of the reactor.). The reaction was carried out at a temperature of 305-320°C, a carrier gas flow rate of 15 ml/min Nz, and a pressure of 5 bar. Within the temperature range 305-320°C and at an MHSV of 0.6 g/(g»h), yields of up to 97% of 3-methylpyridine were achieved, with the only further product being 2.9% MPI. The MPDA, thus, was completely converted to the desired products. No deactivation of the catalysts was observed over a period of 10 days. H2 may also be used as the carrier gas instead of Nj.<br>
The new method thus provided a substantial improvement in activity, selectivity and catalyst life.<br>
Example 13<br>
Production of 3-methylpyridine in two separate reactions using commercial MPDA (MPDA to 3-methylpyridine in 2 stages with isolation of MPI).<br>
Stage 1: 3 g of ZSM-5 in ammonium form (grain size: 0.5-1 mm) were introduced into a reactor (4) 13 mm). MPDA was vaporised and passed over the catalyst with a carrier gas stream of 15 ml/min of Nj at a pressure of 5 bar and a temperature of 335"C. The MHSV was 4.2 g of MPDA per gram of catalyst per hour. The MPDA used was a commercial product obtained from the DuPont de Nemours company under the trade name Dytek A. The reaction ran for over 280 hours and no catalyst deactivation was observed. The product was condensed and the ammonia formed allowed to escape. The yields of MPI were virtually quantitative (&gt; 99.5%).<br>
Stage 2: 10 g of a Pd-MgCl2/Al203 dehydrogenation catalyst were introduced into a reactor ((j) 13 mm). The MPI from the preceding stage was passed over the catalyst in vapour form at a pressure of 1 bar and a temperature of 280°C with a carrier gas stream of 15 ml/min N2. The MHSV was 0.23 g of MPI per gram<br><br>
of catalyst per hour. The reaction ran for over 190 hours and no catalyst deactivation was observed. After 190 h, the following product composition was found by gas chromatography: 99.3% 3-methylpyridine, 0.4% MPI.<br>

(prepared as in example 18). The zeolite was then washed 6<br>
times with 250 ml of deionised water and dried for 24 hours at<br>
120*'C. The resulting catalyst contained approximately 2 wt.%<br>
Pd.<br><br>

Dehydrogenation of 3-methylpiperidine (MPI) to 3-<br>
methylpyridine (PIC).<br>
3-10 g of catalyst (grain sizes 0.315-1 mm) were introduced<br>
into a reactor {(j) 13 mm). MPI was vaporised and passed over<br>
the catalyst (p « 1 bar) at the reactor temperature stated in<br>
table 2. In most cases, a 15 ml/rain stream of hydrogen was<br>
also passed through the reactor. The product stream was<br>
analyzed by gas chromatography. The analytical results set out<br>
in table 2 were obtained once the reaction conditions had<br>
stabilised (&gt; 20 h).<br>

These results clearly show that the impregnated Pd-Mg catalyst (example 26), obtained using the method described in published German patent application no. (DOS) 3410542, and the catalysts obtained by impregnating aluminium oxide with Pd (example 27 and 28) produce less 3-methylpyridine and more unreacted MPI, in the product stream, than the catalysts from examples 15-17 and 19 (according to the invention). The results are all the more surprising as the tests using the impregnated catalysts were performed at a lower catalyst loading. The catalysts of examples 29-31 and 33 were obtained by ion exchange of silicon-aluminium oxide with [Pd(NH3)^]Cl2. Activity may be<br><br>
controlled to a certain extent by the degree of exchange (c.f. examples 29-31 with 5%, 3% and 1% palladium in the exchanged catalyst). In example 32, a catalyst was used in which the support had not been treated with [Pd(NH3)4]Cl2, but with PdCl2 instead. This catalyst exhibited much lower activity than those treated with [Pd(NH3),i]Cl2.<br>
Examples 34-40<br>
3-10 g of catalyst (grain size: 0.315-1 mm) were introduced into a reactor (cj) 13 mm) . The educt used was a crude product ("crude MPI"), which was produced from a mixture of the following composition: 74.9% MPI, 13.9% 2-methyl-l,5-diaminopentane (MPDA), 5.1% organic impurities (principally methylcyclohexyldiamines) and 6.1% water. This crude product was produced by catalytic cyclisation of the MPDA contained in the starting mixture as in examples 15-25. After cyclisation, the "crude MPI" was of the following composition: 89.9% MPI, 4.0% organic impurities and 6.1% water. This starting material was vaporised and passed over the catalysts stated in table 3 (pal bar) at the reactor temperatures stated in the table. In most cases, a 15 ml/min stream of hydrogen was additionally used. The product stream was analyzed by gas chromatography.<br><br>

These results clearly show that, at an MHSV of 1.76, the impregnated Pd-Mg catalyst (example 34), obtained using the method described in DOS-3410542, produces less 3-methylpyridine and more unreacted MPI in the product stream than the catalysts from examples 35-40. The catalysts of examples 35-40 were obtained by ion exchange of silicon-aluminium oxide with [Pd(NH3)4]Cl2. These catalysts exhibit considerably higher activity and allow MPI conversions of above 99.5% to be achieved even at an MHSV of 3.52. The catalyst in example 40 was obtained by ion exchange of a silicon-aluminium oxide, which had been produced using the sol-gel process.<br>
Ammonia was added in example 35. The test demonstrates that the ammonia liberated on cyclisation of MPDA to MPI does not disrupt the reaction. The reaction also proceeds if no hydrogen carrier gas is added (example 36).<br>
Example 41<br>
Pd-exchanged zeolite as catalyst.<br>
10 g of the Pd-ZSM-5 catalyst (grain size: 0.315-1 mm) from<br>
example 25 was introduced into a reactor ((j) 13 mm) . MPI was<br>
vaporised and passed over the catalyst (p « 1 bar) at a<br>
reactor temperature of 280°C and an MHSV of 0.44. The product<br><br>
stream was analyzed by gas chromatography (GC area-%). After a reaction time of 21 hours, the product stream contained 99.2% PIC and 0.8% unreacted MPI. After a reaction time of 213 hours, the product stream contained 93.15% PIC and 6.85% unreacted MPI.<br>
Example 4 2<br>
This test was an attempt to perform the reaction isothermally. To this end, 27 g of the catalyst from example 19 (grain size: 0.315-1 mm) were introduced into a reactor (<j mm the catalyst was diluted with g of support in such a manner that most highly at inlet side reactor and undiluted outlet concentration gradient along bed following approximately an exponential function. educt composition: mpi water organic impurities. vaporised passed over bar mhsv related to active per ml hour product stream analyzed by gas chromatography area- conversion quantitative after hours fraction still contained pic due endothermic nature reaction temperature centre end entire cross-section reactor. time pure anhydrous used as educt. unreacted></j>

This reactor contained 3 g of the dehydrogenation catalyst from example 18 (grain size: 0.32-1 mm). The reactor temperature was 280°C, the pressure 1 bar. Over the course of the test, the educt was changed from MPDA to MPI and then to a crude product (crude 3-MP), which consists of a mixturd of the following composition: 74.9% MPI, 13.9% MPDA, 5.1% organic impurities (principally methylcyclopentanediamine) and 6.1% water.
