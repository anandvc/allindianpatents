				<td>BACTERIAL DELIVERY SYSTEM<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to the delivery of<br>
biologically active agents in vivo. In particular, the<br>
present invention relates to treating, palliating or<br>
preventing diseases using a bacterial delivery system for<br>
delivering biologically active agents directly to an<br>
anatomical site in vivo. In one embodiment, the bacterial<br>
delivery system comprises Helicobacter or bacterium<br>
exhibiting Helicobacter features for delivering<br>
heterologous nucleic acid into an animal or animal cell,<br>
wherein the heterogonous nucleic acid is expressed. In a<br>
further embodiment the Helicobacter has been engineered to<br>
contain a DNA vector that encodes heterogonous nucleic<br>
acid, wherein upon infection the nucleic acid vector is<br>
expressed such that the biologically active agent is<br>
delivered to the animal body, especially at the mucosa.<br>
BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION<br>
There is a continuing need for long-term delivery of<br>
pharmacologic and immunologic agents to individuals with<br>
both congenital and acquired diseases. In most cases, this<br>
involves repeated administration of therapeutic compounds<br>
several times per day, daily or at intervals. However, it<br>
is appreciated that any long-term therapeutic or preventive<br>
regime has problems such as compliance, side effects and<br>
drug resistance. Consequently, there is a constant need to<br>
identify treatments, which will be usually 100% effective,<br>
free from side effects and cheap.<br>
One form of delivery that has been investigated in recent<br>
times for various therapeutic and prophylactic agents has<br>
been the use of microorganisms. Genes of interest from<br>
various organisms including bacteria, viruses, parasites as<br>
well as mammals have, for example, been cloned into a<br>
variety of bacteria, viruses and mycobacteria for the<br>
purpose of directing these micro-organisms to express<br>
foreign protein or impart certain desired properties. These<br>
microorganisms have been used in vaccination programs,<br>
gene-replacement therapies and therapeutic composition<br>
delivery.<br>
Microorganisms have also been used to transform animal<br>
(host) cells in vivo. Host cell transformation can be<br>
accomplished using gene-delivery vectors comprising<br>
replication incompetent viruses (see for example U.S. Pat.<br>
No. 5,824,544), naked DNA, (see for example U.S. Pat. No.<br>
6,261,834), liposomes containing recombinant expression<br>
cassettes (see for example U.S. Pat. No. 6,271,207). Other<br>
molecular-based therapeutic composition delivery approaches<br>
include using replication incompetent recombinant viruses<br>
designed to express heterogonous surface proteins (see, for<br>
example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,376,236).<br>
In recent times, pharmaceutical researchers have also<br>
attempted to develop methods for in vivo therapeutic<br>
composition expression using recombinant organism-based<br>
vectors, inanimate vectors and naked DNA. Examples of<br>
recombinant organism-based vectors include recombinant<br>
bacteria (see for example U.S. Pat. No. 5,547,664) and<br>
viruses such as alphaviruses (see for example U.S. Pat. No.<br>
6,391,632), vaccinia viruses (see for example U.S. Pat. No.<br>
6,267,965), adenoviruses (see for example U.S. Pat. No.<br>
5,698,202) and adenovirus associated virus (AAV) (see for<br>
example U.S. Pat. No. 6,171,597). Inanimate vectors include<br>
lipidic gene delivery vector constructs such as<br>
DNA/cationic liposome complexes, DNA encapsulated in<br>
neutral or anionic liposomes, and liposome-entrapped,<br>
polycation-condensed DNA (LPDI arid LPDII) . (see Ropert,<br>
1999, Braz J Med Bio1 Res, 32 (2):163-9).<br>
Examples of other genes that have been delivered by various<br>
bacteria include cloning the invasion genes of Shigella<br>
into the normally non-invasive E. coli rendering the E.<br>
coli invasive and therefore more suitable for use as a<br>
vaccine strain, or cloning of Plasmodium falciparum malaria<br>
genes into Salmonella typhimurium which subsequently<br>
express these malaria proteins and, following oral<br>
administration of the bacteria, induce specific cytotoxic T<br>
cell immunity and protection in mice against malaria<br>
challenge (see, for example, Hone et al., 1991, Vaccine,<br>
9:810-816; Tacket et al., 1992, Infect. Immun., 60:536-541;<br>
Hone et al., 1992, J. Clin. Invest., 90:412-420; Chatfield<br>
et al., 1992, Vaccine, 10:8-11; Tacket et al., 1992,<br>
Vaccine, 10:443-446; and Mims et al., 1993, In: Medical<br>
Microbiology, Eds., Mosby-Year Book Europe Ltd., London;<br>
Sadoff et al., 1988, Science, 240:336-338; Aggrawal et al.,<br>
1990, J. Exp. Wed., 172:1083-1090).<br>
Attenuated or less virulent Shigella (see, for example,<br>
Noriega et al., 1994, Infect. Immun., 62:5168-5172; US Pat.<br>
Appl. No. 20020176848), Salmonella (see, for example, US<br>
Pat. No. 6,531,313; US Pat. Appl. No. 20030170211),<br>
Listeria (see, for example, Schafer et al., 1992, J.<br>
Immunol., 149:53-59; US Pat. Appl. No. 20030008839), and ,<br>
other bacteria have been given orally to immunise against<br>
subsequent infection with more virulent forms of these<br>
bacteria. Likewise, attenuated bacterial and mycobacterial<br>
organisms such as Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG)<br>
(Lagranderie et al., 1993, Vaccine, 11:1283-1290; Flynn,<br>
1994, Cell. Molec. Biol., 40(Suppl. l):31-36) have been<br>
administered parenterally to protect against related<br>
organisms such as M. tuberculosis.<br>
Some of the other bacterial species that have been used as<br>
vectors include yersinia enterocolitica (van Damme et al.,<br>
1992, Gastroenterol., 103:520-531) and Vibrio cholerae<br>
(Levine et al., 1994, In: Vibrio cholerae, Molecular to<br>
Global Perspective's, Wachsmuth et al.r Eds, ASM Press,<br>
Washington, D.C., pages 395-414).<br>
Despite all of the research all of the above bacterial<br>
delivery systems have technical difficulties, which need to<br>
be overcome before these can be used in vivo. Indeed, most<br>
of the bacterial systems require the bacteria themselves to<br>
produce functional molecules and are dependent on a<br>
bacterium which is sufficiently attenuated to be safe for<br>
use in humans, but still able to produce biologically<br>
active agents. However, all of the attenuated strains of<br>
bacteria used previously are not capable' of surviving<br>
lengthy periods in vivo, without causing side effects. More<br>
importantly, many of these bacterial species are not<br>
capable of delivering therapeutic or prophylactic agents to<br>
the mucosal epithelial cells of an animal. However, many<br>
of the most important therapeutic agents are taken up via<br>
the mucosa; therefore there is a need for a bacterial<br>
delivery system capable of delivering biologically active<br>
agents directly to the mucosa.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 5,877,159 to Powell et al.r describes live<br>
bacteria that can invade mucosal cells without establishing<br>
a productive infection or causing disease to thereby<br>
introduce a eukaryotic expression cassette encoding an<br>
antigen capable of being expressed by the animal cells.<br>
While this method allows delivery of the DNA vaccine to<br>
mucosal surfaces, including easy administration, a concern<br>
for vaccine delivery in developing countries, it does not<br>
have the advantage of providing amplifiable mRNA encoding<br>
the gene of interest. Moreover, the bacterium disclosed in<br>
Powell et-al. is not capable of sustained delivery.<br>
Non-pathogenic, non-colonising, non-invasive food-grade<br>
bacterium Lactococcus lactis has been used previously in<br>
the past to deliver agents to the mucosa (see, for example,<br>
UK patent GB-2278358B) . However, while Lactococcus lactis<br>
is non-invasive it is not capable of establishing a chronic<br>
infection, which is capable of delivering continuous<br>
therapeutic agents directly into mucosal epithelial cells.<br>
Consequently, there is a continuing need for a delivery<br>
system, which is capable of establishing a non-invasive,<br>
chronic infection in close proximity to the mucosal<br>
epithelial cells of an animal such that biologically active<br>
agents can be delivered thereto. Moreover, there is a<br>
continuing need for improved delivery mechanisms for<br>
pharmacologically active molecules at the mucosal surface<br>
sufficient to elicit a useful and beneficial immunogenic<br>
response. Such would provide an effective in vivo delivery<br>
system for pharmacological active agents, as well as an<br>
effective method for immunization, i.e., antigen exposure<br>
at mucosal surface sufficient to elicit a general humoral<br>
and mucosal immune response.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed to overcoming the abovementioned<br>
challenges and is exemplified in a number of<br>
implementations and applications, some of which are<br>
summarized below.<br>
The inventors have now surprisingly found that Helicobacter<br>
and in particular Helicobacter pylori, which is capable of<br>
forming a chronic infection, can be used to produce<br>
continuous drug delivery. Moreover, Helicobacter of the<br>
present invention can be activated and inactivated at<br>
various times and because of its chronicity, the<br>
Helicobacter can be used to deliver drugs through the<br>
gastric mucosa.<br>
Helicobacter pylori is a gram-negative spiral shaped<br>
bacterium found almost exclusively in the human gastric<br>
mucosa. The acidity of the human stomach is an effective<br>
barrier to colonization by essentially all bacteria, with<br>
the exception of Helicobacter species.<br>
H. pylori has the unique ability to colonize and -persist<br>
for decades within the human gastric mucosa, despite<br>
development of a mucosal inflammatory and immune response.<br>
This characteristic renders H. pylori an interesting<br>
candidate for the delivery of selected agents though the<br>
mucosa.<br>
In accordance with some aspects, compositions, methods and<br>
systems are provided for preparing and using a<br>
Helicobacter-based construct comprising a Helicobacter<br>
sequence having a promoter region and a non-Helicobacter<br>
sequence encoding a non-Helicobacter pharmacologically<br>
active molecule. This construct in some embodiments is<br>
described as a vector or a plasmid vector, wherein the<br>
promoter sequence is capable of controlling the expression<br>
of the non-Hell cojbacter pharmacologically active molecule<br>
of interest.<br>
Accordingly, in a first aspect the present invention<br>
provides a method of delivering one or more biologically<br>
active agents to a subject comprising the step of<br>
administering to a subject an effective amount, preferably<br>
a therapeutically or prophylactically effective amount of,<br>
Helicobacter cells or bacterial cells having the features<br>
of Helicobacter, which cells express said one or more<br>
biologically active agents.<br>
In a second aspect, the present invention provides a noninvasive<br>
or non-pathogenic Helicobacter cell expressing one<br>
or more heterologous biologically active agents.<br>
Preferably, the Helicobacter is of the species H. pylori.<br>
The biologically active agent can be either homologous to<br>
the Helicobacter genus or heterologous to cells of the<br>
genus or species of the Helicobacter cells used for<br>
delivery. Heterologous agents may be derived from either<br>
eukaryotic or prokaryotic sources.<br>
In some aspects, the HeJicojbacter-based vector and vector<br>
plasmid constructs comprise biologically active agents such<br>
as an antigen, organic or inorganic molecule or substance,<br>
a pharmacological agent eg a therapeutic agent or<br>
prophylactic agent, such as a gene product or gene sequence<br>
(isolated nucleic acid). By way of example, such agents may<br>
include an immunqregulatory agent, hormone, ligand, an<br>
enzyme or an anti-sense RNA, a catalytic RNA, a protein, a<br>
peptide or any other molecule which can be present on or<br>
released from the bacterial cells so that it may be<br>
delivered to an animal or to an animal cell.<br>
In some embodiments, the biologically active agent is<br>
encoded by a nucleic acid molecule, which is preferably<br>
obtained in isolated form, and subsequently inserted into<br>
the bacterial delivery vehicle of this invention. It will<br>
be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the<br>
isolated nucleic acid molecule of the present invention may<br>
be cDNA, genomic DNA, RNA, or a hybrid molecule thereof.<br>
Preferably, the nucleic acid is cDNA.<br>
By way of example, a protein and/or peptide of interest may<br>
comprise ghrelin, amylin, insulin, motilin, (3-glucosidase,<br>
a chemical chaperone, or other molecule useful in the<br>
treatment of Gauchers disease, cell wasting, human<br>
immunodeficiency disease (AIDS), appetite suppression,<br>
preparations useful in the treatment of diabetes, etc.<br>
The isolated nucleic acid is preferably incorporated into<br>
an expression vector, which can be transformed into and<br>
maintained in the Helicobacter cells.<br>
Accordingly, in a third aspect, the present invention<br>
provides a recombinant vector for delivering biologically<br>
active agents directly to an anatomical site in need<br>
thereof. The Hellcobacter cell of the present invention has<br>
preferably been adapted to secrete and/or express on its<br>
surface the biologically active agents.<br>
In a fourth aspect, the present invention provides a vector<br>
or construct for delivering in vivo an effective amount of<br>
a biologically active agent, comprising:<br>
a) a nucleotide sequence encoding a<br>
biologically active agent;<br>
b) operatively linked thereto, a control or<br>
regulatory sequence capable of controlling the expression<br>
of the nucleotide sequence of (a) such that the<br>
biologically active agent is produced in vivo when the<br>
delivery vehicle comprising the vector is delivered to a<br>
subject.<br>
The vector maybe modified chemically by means of chemical<br>
or enzymatic treatment, or in vivo by means of recombinant<br>
DNA technology to produce a modified or variant vector.<br>
Such a construct may differ from those disclosed, for<br>
example, by virtue of one or more nucleotide substitutions,<br>
deletions or insertions, but substantially retain a desired<br>
biological activity of the construct or nucleic acid<br>
molecule, or its encoded product, in accordance with this<br>
invention.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the<br>
Helicobacter vector or construct is provided with a<br>
reporter gene(s) expressed from a constitutive promoter<br>
cloned into the expression vector and used as a screening<br>
tool. Non-limiting examples of reporter genes suitable for<br>
use herein include green fluorescent protein (GFP), |Jgalactosidase,<br>
amylase, and chloramphenicol acetyl<br>
transferase (CAT).<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention the<br>
Helicobacter cell is used to deliver a heterologous gene of<br>
interest to a subject in need thereof. The gene of interest<br>
may encode a therapeutic product (a transgene product),<br>
including, but not limited to a peptide hormone (such as,<br>
but not limited to a-melanocyte-stimulating hormone<br>
(a-MSH), insulin, growth hormone, and parathyroid hormone),<br>
a cytokine including, but not limited to an interferon,<br>
interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4, IL-10, IL-12, granulocyte colony<br>
stimulating factor (G-CSF), granulocyte-macrophage colony<br>
stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and erythropoietin (EPO).<br>
In still another embodiment, the present invention provides<br>
methods for treating, palliating or preventing a disease in<br>
a subject. These methods are facilitated with the use of a<br>
therapeutic or prophylactic composition. Accordingly, in a<br>
fifth aspect, the present invention provides a<br>
pharmaceutical composition comprising (a) live nonpathogenic<br>
Helicobacter cells expressing and/or secreting a<br>
biologically active agent, together with (b) a<br>
therapeutically effective carrier.<br>
In a sixth aspect the present invention provides a method<br>
of treating, preventing or palliating a disease comprising<br>
administering to a subject in need thereof an effective<br>
amount of a Helicobacter cells of the present invention<br>
that express the biologically active agent.<br>
Non-limiting examples of subjects in which the present<br>
invention may be used, include mammals such as primates,<br>
equines, bovines, porcines, ovines and rodents. Also<br>
intended are fish and birds.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention the disease<br>
being treated, prevented or palliated is cancer, a disease<br>
or condition of the immune/hematopoietic system, a disease<br>
or condition of the reproductive system, a disease or<br>
condition of the musculoskeletal system, a disease or<br>
condition of the cardiovascular system, a disease or a<br>
condition described as mixed fetal, a disease or a<br>
condition of the excretory system, a disease or a condition<br>
of the neural/sensory system, a disease or a condition of<br>
the endocrine system, a disease or condition of the<br>
respiratory system, a disease or condition of the digestive<br>
system and a disease or condition associated with<br>
connective/epithelial tissue or disease or conditions<br>
caused by bacterial, viral or parasitic infection.<br>
The present invention provides a variety of<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable preparations formulated for<br>
delivery to a patient, such as, gastrically, orally, or<br>
intranasaly. In particular embodiments, the composition<br>
are suitable for delivery at a mucosal surface. In<br>
particular embodiments, the composition is suitable for<br>
delivery to the mucosal surface of the gut.<br>
By way of example, the mucosa may be that of the gastric,<br>
vaginal, nasal, oral, or ocular surface, or any other of<br>
the body characterized by the presence of a penetrable<br>
mucosal surface or lining. In some embodiments, the<br>
mucosal surface is the gastric mucosal surface.<br>
The various delivery forms of the compositions are readily<br>
prepared for use in the practice of the present invention<br>
given the specific types and ratios of specific<br>
Helicobacter, Helicobacter constructs and other delivery<br>
vehicles described herein, and those formulation techniques<br>
known to those in the formulary arts, such as are described<br>
in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 20th edition, Mack<br>
Publishing Company, which text is specifically incorporated<br>
herein by reference.<br>
lt is envisioned that the delivery system may be employed<br>
in animals, particularly primates, including humans,<br>
equines, bovines, ovines, and rodents, fish and birds. It<br>
is also anticipated that the preparations may be used on<br>
both infants and adults, as well as parentally or for<br>
administration to pregnant or lactating animals. The<br>
preparations and methods may be further described as<br>
suitable for both male and female animals.<br>
In yet another aspect, a method is provided for vaccinating<br>
an animal. In some embodiments, the method comprises<br>
administering a composition comprising a vaccine comprising<br>
cells transformed with the Helicobacter- based plasmid<br>
vector and/or plasmid vectors as described herein. In<br>
other embodiments, the method provides for the delivery of<br>
an effective amount of the pharmacologically active<br>
molecule of interest sufficient to eliminate or inhibit a<br>
disease or physiological condition in the animal, or<br>
sufficient to elicit an immune response specific for the<br>
pharmacologically active molecule of interest.<br>
By way of example, the non-Helicobacter pharmacologically<br>
active molecule of interest useful in the vaccine may<br>
comprise a mammalian protein, peptide, enzyme, hormone, or<br>
any combination of these. In particular embodiments, the<br>
pharmacologically active molecule of interest is further<br>
defined as a human pharmacologically active molecule of<br>
interest. In some embodiments the pharmacologically active<br>
molecule of interest is a human pathogen molecule/antigen,<br>
human protein antigen, such as amylin or an analog or<br>
derivative thereof, or ghrelin, or an analog or derivative<br>
thereof.<br>
In particular embodiments, the vaccine conveys immunity<br>
against the human pathogen, Ebola virus, HIV virus, Marburg<br>
virus, influenza virus, and the like. Replication competent<br>
vaccines based on attenuated recombinant vesicular<br>
stomatitis virus vectors have been described by Jones et<br>
al. (2005, Wat. Afed. 11: 786-90) that include Ebola<br>
glycoprotein and Marburg glycoprotein. Hence, it is<br>
envisioned that constructs using the HelicoJbacter-based<br>
vector systems and plasmid vector systems with these and<br>
other glycoprotein's associated with human pathogens may<br>
also be provided according to the present invention<br>
together with the disclosure provided herein.<br>

An "antibiotic resistance gene" as defined herein includes<br>
heterologous nucleic acid sequences purposely provided to a<br>
vector and used as a selection system. The term "antibiotic<br>
resistance gene" does not include other mechanisms or genes<br>
that impart antibiotic resistance to naturally occurring<br>
micro-flora organisms.<br>
The term "attenuated" as used herein for example to<br>
describe a bacterial strain, particularly an E. coli or a<br>
Helicobacter strain such as Helicobacter pylori, is defined<br>
- 14 -<br>
as a strain that is less virulent and/or toxic (invasive)<br>
that a native, wild type bacterial strain.<br>
The term "biologically active" as used herein refers to<br>
ability to perform a biological function and with reference<br>
to a polypeptide implies that the polypeptide adopts a<br>
stable conformation ("folded form") which is the same or<br>
closely analogous to its native conformation. When folded<br>
correctly or substantially correctly, for example with<br>
formation of proper folded units a-helices, p-sheets,<br>
domains, disulphide bridges etc., a polypeptide should have<br>
the ability to perform its natural function. Generally, the<br>
unit of function in a polypeptide is a domain.<br>
Mere ability to be bound by an antibody or other receptor,<br>
either with or without elicitation of an immune response,<br>
is passive or does not constitute "biological activity".<br>
Any antigen has the ability to be bound by an antibody but<br>
is not necessarily biologically active.<br>
"Clinical grade vector" as used herein means a plasmid or<br>
other expression vector that is capable of being expressed<br>
in Helicobacter or a non-pathogenic bacterium engineered to<br>
have features of Helicobacter. The clinical grade vectors<br>
of the present invention do not use antibiotic resistance<br>
markers for selection and/or have been modified to prevent<br>
replication outside the host e.g. such as a suicide vector.<br>
An example of suicide system in H. pylori has been<br>
described by Panthel et al. 2003 (Infection <e immunity></e>
109-116). This system introduces a plasmid into H. pylori<br>
which contains the PhiXl74 lysis gene E. To eradicate the<br>
strain, incubation at 42°C for 5 hours was used. In vivo<br>
this would mean that the animal would consume a drink at<br>
45-50°C to raise the temperature of the gastric environment<br>
above 42°C.<br>
A second example is the L-Dap selection system, commonly<br>
used to allow survival of bacterial mutants on supplemented<br>
plates (see, for example, Kirata et al, 1997 (Infection &amp;<br>
Immunity, 65: 4158-4164). In this system the animal subject<br>
must supplement their diet with a missing substrate i.e.<br>
diamino-pimelic-acid (DAP), in order for the DapE deficient<br>
H. pylori mutant to survive. In order to eradicate the then<br>
DAP consumption is ceased.<br>
A third possible system relates to metronidazole<br>
sensitivity of H. pylori because of its rdxA gene.<br>
Excessive replication of the rdxA gene is harmful to<br>
mammalian cells and E. coli. However, duplication may be<br>
tolerated by the bacterium. Therefore a Helicobacter<br>
species of the present invention can be engineered to<br>
contain two copies of rdxA which prevent the normal<br>
mutation-dependant rdxA loss. The introduction of at least ,<br>
two functional rdxA genes into the Helicobacter genome<br>
should result in a Helicobacter strain, which is<br>
permanently sensitive to metronidazole. Jeong et al. 2000<br>
(J. Bacteriol., 182: 5082-5090) showed that the<br>
nitroreductase produced by a functional rdxA gene converts<br>
metronidazole from a prodrug to a bactericidal compound.<br>
The mode of action of the active compound is to cause DNA<br>
breaks of the Helicobacter genome.<br>
"Detectable immune response" as used herein is either an<br>
antibody (humoral) or cytotoxic (cellular) response formed<br>
in an animal in response to an antigen that can be measured<br>
using routine laboratory methods including, but not limited<br>
to enzyme-linked immunosorbant assays (ELISA), radio-immune<br>
assays (RIA), Enzyme-linked ImmunoSPOT•(ELISPOT),<br>
immunofluorescent assays (IFA), complement fixation assays<br>
(CF), Western Blot (WB) or an equivalent thereto.<br>
"Gene of interest" as used herein refers to any nucleic<br>
acid sequence encoding for a polypeptide or protein whose<br>
expression is desired. The gene of interest may or may not<br>
include the promoter or other regulatory components. The<br>
gene of interest also includes constructs capable of<br>
producing anti-sense RNA.<br>
"Gene therapy" as used herein is defined as the delivery of<br>
a gene of interest to an animal in need thereof using a<br>
recombinant vector. The gene of interest can be a transgene<br>
encoding for a therapeutic or prophylactic protein or<br>
polypeptide including, but not limited to cytokines, antiinflammatories,<br>
anti-proliferatives, antibiotics, metabolic<br>
inhibitors/activators and immunologically active antigens<br>
and fragments thereof. Furthermore, "gene therapy" as used<br>
herein also includes gene replacement technologies directed<br>
at both inherited and non-inherited disorders.<br>
The term Helicobacter includes all bacteria of the genus<br>
Helicobacter including H. pylori and H. mustelae. The term<br>
also includes bacteria that have similar biology to H.<br>
pylori in that they are capable of residing on the gastric<br>
mucosa of primates and/or capable of establishing a<br>
chronic, but isolated infection of the mucosa. The term<br>
also encompasses bacteria that have been modified so that<br>
the bacterium has H. pylori features such as the ability to<br>
reside on the gastric mucosa.<br>
A "heterologous" polypeptide is one not native to<br>
Helicobacter, i.e., not expressed by Helicobacter in nature<br>
or prior to introduction into Helicobacter, or an ancestor<br>
thereof, of encoding nucleic acid for the biologically<br>
active agent.<br>
"Host" as used herein defines the intended recipient of a<br>
therapeutic composition of the present invention. Host<br>
includes all animals. Specifically, hosts include, but are<br>
not limited to, primates (including man), bovine, equine,<br>
canine, feline, porcine, ovine, rabbits, rodents, birds and<br>
"Immunologically inert" as used herein shall mean any<br>
substance, including microorganisms such as microflora that<br>
does not provoke a significant immune response in its host.<br>
Examples of immunologically inert materials as used herein<br>
include stainless steel, biocompatible polymers such as<br>
poly-L-lactide, medical grade plastics and the microflora<br>
organisms of the present invention. A "significant immune"<br>
response is any immune response that would limit or<br>
restrict the in vivo utility of a material or organism used<br>
in accordance with the teachings of the present invention.<br>
A detectable immune response is not necessarily a<br>
"significant immune response."<br>
An "isolated nucleic acid" is a nucleic acid the structure<br>
of which is not identical to that of any naturally<br>
occurring nucleic acid or to that of any fragment of a<br>
naturally occurring genomic nucleic acid spanning more than<br>
three separate genes. The term therefore covers, for<br>
example, (a) a DNA molecule which has the sequence of part<br>
of a naturally occurring genomic DNA molecule but is not<br>
flanked by both of the coding sequences that flank that<br>
part of the molecule in the genome of the organism in which<br>
it naturally occurs; (b) a nucleic acid incorporated into a<br>
vector or into the genomic DNA of a prokaryote or eukaryote<br>
in a manner such that the resulting molecule is not<br>
identical to any naturally occurring vector or genomic DNA;<br>
(c) a separate molecule such as a cDNA, a genomic fragment,<br>
a fragment produced by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), or<br>
a restriction fragment; and (d) a recombinant nucleotide<br>
sequence that is part of a hybrid gene, i.e., a gene<br>
encoding a fusion protein. Specifically excluded from this<br>
definition are nucleic acids present in mixtures of (i) DNA<br>
molecules, (ii&gt; transfected cells, and (iii) cell clones,<br>
e.g., as these occur in a DNA library such as a cDNA or<br>
genomic DNA library.<br>
"Percent identity (homology)" of two amino acid sequences<br>
or of two nucleic acids is determined using the algorithm<br>
of Karlin and Altschul, 1990, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA,<br>
87:2264-2268, 1990, modified as in Karlin and Altschul<br>
(Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90:5873-5877, 1993). Such an<br>
algorithm is incorporated into the NBLAST and XBLAST<br>
programs of Altschul et al. (J. Mol. Biol. 215:403-410,<br>
1990). BLAST nucleotide searches are performed with the<br>
NBLAST program, score=100, wordlength=12, to obtain<br>
nucleotide sequences homologous to a nucleic acid molecule<br>
of the invention. BLAST protein searches are performed with<br>
the XBLAST program, score=50, word.length=3, to obtain amino<br>
acid sequences homologous to a reference polypeptide (eg.,<br>
SEQ ID NO: 2). To obtain gapped alignments for comparison<br>
purposes, Gapped BLAST is utilised as described in Altschul<br>
et al. (Nucleic Acids Res. 25:3389-3402, 1997). When<br>
utilising BLAST and Gapped BLAST programs, the default<br>
parameters of the respective programs (eg., XBLAST and<br>
NBLAST) are used. These maybe found on the World Wide Web<br>
at the URL "ncbi.nim.nih.gov."<br>
The term "reporter gene" as used herein is a nucleic acid<br>
sequence incorporated into (or adjacent to) the<br>
heterologous nucleic acid encoding for the gene of interest<br>
that provides the transformed vector expressing the gene of<br>
interest an identifiable phenotype. Non-limiting examples<br>
of reporter genes include GFP, p-galactosidase, amylase,<br>
and CAT.<br>
"Screening marker" as used herein refers to an identifying<br>
characteristic (phenotype) provided to a transformed vector<br>
made in accordance with the teachings of the present<br>
invention. In one embodiment of the present invention the<br>
screening marker is a reporter gene.<br>
"Selectable marker," "selectable gene," "reporter gene" and<br>
"reporter marker" (referred to hereinafter as a "selectable<br>
marker") as used herein refer to nucleic acid sequences<br>
encoding for phenotypic traits that permit the rapid<br>
identification and isolation of a transformed bacterial<br>
vector. Generally, bacterial vectors deemed "clinical<br>
grade" and made in accordance with the teachings of the<br>
present invention are those vectors having selectable<br>
markers that do not encode for antibiotic resistance.<br>

The term "a" and "the" as used in the present descriptive<br>
is intended to include both one (the singular) and more<br>
than one (plural).<br>
A "therapeutically effective amount" of an active agent or<br>
combination of agents as described herein is understood to<br>
comprise an amount effective to elicit the desired response<br>
but insufficient to cause a toxic reaction. A desired<br>
response, for example, may constitute the formation of a<br>
sufficient and/or acceptable detectable antibody titer<br>
level in a blood sample. The dosage and duration of<br>
treatment of the preparation to be administered to a<br>
subject will be determined by the health professional<br>
attending the subject in need of treatment, and will<br>
consider the age, sex, weight, extent of existing diseased<br>
state and/or tissue damage of the subject, and specific<br>
formulation of Helicobacter and the gene of interest<br>
product being used as the treatment for the subject.<br>
The phrase, "effective level" refers to the level of the<br>
desired activity of the molecules and not necessarily<br>
limited to the number of molecules. For example, the<br>
effective level of amyliri may be decreased to stimulate<br>
ghrelin secretion by using amylin antagonists, without a<br>
necessary concomitant decrease in the amount of free amylin<br>
present in a subject.<br>
The phrase "ghrelin-associated diseases and disorders"<br>
refers to any condition that can be treated prevented or<br>
ameliorated through the modulation of ghrelin activity.<br>
These include conditions that are enhanced, exacerbated or<br>
stimulated by ghrelin, for example, growth hormone release<br>
or drive to eat. The physiological actions of ghrelin are<br>
considered to include, by way of example, the stimulation<br>
of growth hormone release, the stimulation of hormone<br>
secretion from lactotrophs and corticotropes, orexigenic<br>
and cardiovascular actions, anti-proliferative effects on<br>
thyroid and breast tumors and regulation of gastric<br>
motility and acid secretion through vagal mediation. (See<br>
WO 2005021026).<br>
Throughout the specification, unless the context requires<br>
otherwise, the word "comprise" or variations such as<br>
"comprises" or "comprising", will be understood to imply<br>
the inclusion of a stated integer or group of integers but<br>
not the exclusion of any other integer or group of<br>
integers.<br>
Where the definition of terms departs from the commonly<br>
used meaning of the term, applicant intends to utilize the<br>
definitions provided herein, unless specifically indicated.<br>
