receiving apparatus receiving video data, a video data<br>
transmitting apparatus transmitting video data<br>
broadcasting system distributing video<br>
2. Description of the Related Art<br>
In current broadcasting systems, two types of<br>
broadcasts have known.<br>
One is the system in which the viewer does not<br>
have to pay for viewing the programs since commercial<br>
advertisements (hereinafter referred to as commercials or<br>
CMs ) are inserted during the broadcast . The programs<br>
provided by private broadcasting stations for usual<br>
television broadcasts are broadcasted by this system.<br>
The other one is the system in which the<br>
viewer must pay for every program or for every<br>
predetermined period (every month or the like) in place<br>
of Insertion of commercials during the program. The<br>
television broadcasts by Japan's NHK, satellite<br>
broadcasts, broadcast by cable TV, etc. are included in<br>
this system.<br>
In such current broadcasting systems, the<br>
type of the broadcasting system is determined by the<br>
broadcasting station and is not determined by the program<br>
content.<br>
In practice, however, programs in which real<br>
time and instantaneousness are sought, for example,<br>
sports broadcasts, it is not desirable for the programs<br>
to be interrupted by CMs. There are viewers who would<br>
like to view the entire period even if having to pay a fee.<br>
Further, conversely, it is easy to imagine that there are<br>
viewers who, depending on the content of the program,<br>
would not mind watching it with CMs inserted, so would<br>
like to watch it free.<br>
In broadcasting systems heretofore, however,<br>
these desires of the viewers, for example, the desire to<br>
view a program continuously without CMs even if having to<br>
pay or the desire to view a program for free since CMs<br>
can be inserted, have never been reflected at all.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
An explanation will be made of embodiments of the<br>
present invention by referring to Fig. 1 to Fig. 11.<br>
In the present embodiments, the explanation will be<br>
made of a broadcasting system as shown in Fig. 1<br>
constituted by an audeo data and/or video data (AV data)<br>
transmitting apparatus serving as the host apparatus<br>
transmitting a program and an AV data receiving apparatus<br>
serving as a user terminal for receiving the program at<br>
an individual home.<br>
More specifically, video data and audio data<br>
therefor, or at least video data (AV data or video data)<br>
is transmitted from the AV data transmitting apparatus<br>
100 to a user based on a predetermined program schedule.<br>
Hereinafter the audio data and video data are refereed as<br>
AV data. Each user views transmitted AV data with a<br>
program data receiving apparatus 200. The user selects<br>
the program and the type of insertion of CM programs into<br>
the program and views that program or that program and<br>
CMs. At this time, the state of the viewing is notified<br>
from the AV data receiving apparatus 200 to the AV data<br>
transmitting apparatus 100 via a telephone line.<br>
Below, embodiments of the video data transmitting<br>
apparatus of the present invention and the video data<br>
receiving apparatus of the present invention used in such<br>
a broadcasting system of the present invention will be<br>
explained in detail.<br>
First, an embodiment of an AV data transmitting<br>
apparatus of the present invention will be explained.<br>
Figure 2 is a block diagram of the configuration of<br>
an AV data transmitting apparatus lOOa.<br>
The AV data transmitting apparatus lOOa comprises a<br>
VTR 101, a first image encoder 102, a distributor 103,<br>
first to n-th program data storing units 104^ to 104 n.<br>
first to n-th CM data storing units 105-1 to 105_n, a<br>
receiving unit 106, a second image encoder 107, first to<br>
n-th selecting switches 108-1 to 108_n, first to n-th<br>
multiplexing units 109-1 to 109.n, first to n-th<br>
transmission use encoders 110 L to 110-1, a transmission<br>
use multiplexing unit 111, and a transmitting unit 112.<br>
First, an explanation will be made of the<br>
configuration of the units.<br>
The VTR 101 is a reproducing apparatus for inputting<br>
the AV data to be transmitted to the AV data transmitting<br>
apparatus lOOa. The AV data transmitted by the AV data<br>
transmitting apparatus lOOa includes AV data recorded on<br>
a magnetic tape and AV data captured in real time and<br>
broadcasted live. Among them, about the AV data recorded<br>
and stored on the magnetic tape, the magnetic tape is set<br>
to the VTR 101 in advance. And the AV data reproduced by<br>
the VTR 101 is inputted to the AV data transmitting<br>
apparatus lOOa to prepare for distribution.<br>
The first image encoder 102 encodes and compresses<br>
the video data of the AV data inputted from the VTR 101.<br>
In the present embodiment, it is compressed by the MPEG2<br>
(system of encoding moving pictures of Moving Picture<br>
Coding Experts Group). The AV data which amount of<br>
information is compressed by the first image encoder 102<br>
is successively outputted to the distributor 103. This AV<br>
data comprises program data and commercial data for<br>
commercial broadcasting. And the commercial data contains<br>
video data and audio data. Note that, hereinafter, the<br>
commercial data is refereed CM data.<br>
The distributor 103 is a. switching unit which Inputs<br>
the program data included in the AV data inputted from<br>
the first image encoder 102 to any one of the first to nth<br>
program data storing units 104-1 to 104 n and inputs the<br>
CM data included in the AV data to any one of the first<br>
to n-th CM data storing units 105-1 to 105 n. The program<br>
data and CM data reproduced at the VTR 101 and inputted<br>
to the distributor 103 are inputted to any of the program<br>
data storing units or the CM data storing units in<br>
accordance with the number of the channel through which<br>
it is transmitted. More specifically, the program data is<br>
stored in any one of the first to n-th program data<br>
storing units 104-1to 104n in oorrespondenoe to each<br>
channel i through which the data is transmitted. Further,<br>
the CM data is successively inputted and stored to the<br>
first CM data storing unit 105.x, second CM data storing<br>
unit 105 2, ... in order of input.<br>
Note that the distributor 103 distributes the AV data<br>
by the control of the control unit 120. the control unit<br>
120 controls the operation of the distributor 103 based<br>
on the distributing information data inputted from the<br>
input unit 123 and stored. The distributing information<br>
data is the data indicating the relationship between the<br>
time code data and distribution channels. The control<br>
unit 120 receives the time code data of the AV data being<br>
reproduced at the present time, so that the control unit<br>
120 decides a destination by the distributing of the AV<br>
data being reproduced at the present time.<br>
The first to n-th program data storing units 104-1 to<br>
104 n are provided corresponding to the channels of the<br>
transmission data and store the program data, that is,<br>
the main transmission AV data inputted from the<br>
distributor 103. Note that, in the present embodiment,<br>
the first to n-th program data storing units 104-1 to 104 n<br>
are constituted by hard magnetic disk devices.<br>
The storing and reproducing operation of the first to<br>
n-th program data storing units 104-1 to 104n are<br>
controlled by the control unit 120.<br>
The first to n-th CM data storing units 105-1 to<br>
105 are provided corresponding to the channels of the<br>
transmission data and store additional transmission AV<br>
data such as CMs inputted from the distributor 103. Note<br>
that, in the present embodiment, the first to n-th CM<br>
data storing units 105-1 to 105-1are constituted by hard<br>
magnetic disk devices.<br>
The storing and reproducing operation of the first to<br>
n-th CM data storing units 105-1 to 105-1 are controlled by<br>
the control unit 120.<br>
The receiving unit 106 is a receiving unit for<br>
receiving program data relayed from a site when<br>
transmitting a live broadcast program captured in real<br>
time from the AV data transmitting apparatus lOOa. The<br>
received program data is Inputted to the second image<br>
encoder 107.<br>
The second image encoder 107 encodes and compresses<br>
the video data of the program data inputted from the<br>
receiving unit 106. In the present embodiment, the video<br>
data is compressed by the MFEG2 similar to the first<br>
image encoder 102. The compressed program data of the<br>
video data is inputted via a selecting switch 108-1 (i = <br>
to n) to a multiplexing unit 109-1 (i = 1 to n).<br>
The first to n-th selecting switches 108-1 to 108.n<br>
are switches for selecting the program data to be outputted<br>
to the channels. To the terminal 3 of a selecting switch<br>
108 t (1 = 1 to n) is inputted the program data stored in<br>
the program data storing unit 104-1, and to the terminal <br>
is inputted the program data from the second image<br>
encoder 107. Accordingly, the terminal an is selected at<br>
an i-th selecting switch 108t when transmitting a<br>
preliminarily prepared program through a certain channel<br>
1 (i = 1 to n), and the terminal b is selected when<br>
transmitting a live broadcast program captured in real<br>
time.<br>
The first to n-th multiplexing units 109-1 to 109.n<br>
generate a series of transmission AV data in a channel i<br>
(i = 1 to n) based on the program data selected at the<br>
first to n-th selecting switches 108-1to 108-1 and the CM<br>
data stored in the first to n-th CM data storing units<br>
105 to 105n. There are various methods as the method of<br>
generating the transmission AV data, but in the present<br>
embodiment, first, the program data stored in a program<br>
data storing unit 104-1is continuously outputted after<br>
the CM data stored in the CM data storing unit 105-1 (i =<br>
1 to n) of each channel to generate a series of<br>
transmission AV data.<br>
As mentioned before, the program data stored in the<br>
program data storing unit 104-1 is stored corresponding to<br>
a channel 1 thereof, but the CM data stored in the CM<br>
data storing unit 105-1 is not given correspondence with<br>
the channels and can be selected by the AV data receiving<br>
apparatus mentioned later. At the point of time when it<br>
is transmitted from the AV data transmitting apparatus<br>
lOOa, however, it is added before the program data and<br>
transmitted.<br>
The first to n-th transmission use encoders 110-1 to<br>
110 convert the transmission AV data inputted from the<br>
first to n-th multiplexing units 109-1 to 109 n to<br>
transmission signals and output the result to the<br>
transmission use multiplexing unit 111. More<br>
specifically, a transmission use encoder 110 -1 (i = 1 to<br>
n) encodes the data of the transmission AV data for<br>
transmission purposes and performs modulation for<br>
transmission etc.<br>
The transmission use multiplexing unit 111<br>
multiplexes the transmission signals outputted from n<br>
number of transmission use encoders 110^ to 110 n and<br>
converts the result to signals which can be transmitted<br>
and selected together in the broadcasting system.<br>
The transmitting unit 112 actually transmits the<br>
transmission signal multiplexed in the transmission use<br>
multiplexing unit 111.<br>
Next, an explanation will be made of the operation of<br>
the AV data transmitting apparatus lOOa.<br>
In the present embodiment, an explanation will be<br>
made of a case where, for example, four programs A to D<br>
and, for example, two types of CMs 1 and 2 added to them<br>
are transmitted. Note that, each of the programs A to D<br>
is a two-hour program, and each of the CMs 1 and 2 is an<br>
eight minute CM obtained by connecting CMs of for example<br>
15 seconds and 13 seconds. Further, the programs A to D are<br>
transmitted so that they are respectively viewed in the<br>
channels 1 to 4, and the CMs 1 and 2 are transmitted so<br>
that they are appropriately outputted by the selection of<br>
the viewer in each channel. Further, the programs A to C<br>
and the CMs 1 and 2 are AV data which have been already<br>
recorded on the magnetic tape, and the program D is the<br>
AV data which is captured and relayed in real time.<br>
First, program data containing video data and audio<br>
data of the programs A to C are successively reproduced<br>
by the VTR 101 from the magnetic tape on which the<br>
programs A to C, that is, the main programs to be<br>
transmitted, are recorded. The program data is inputted<br>
to the AV data transmitting apparatus lOOa. Namely, the<br>
program data are successively reproduced from the VTR<br>
tape by the VTR 101, and the program data are compressed<br>
based on the MFEG2 method by the first image encoder 102.<br>
The program A consists of the program data to be<br>
transmitted via the channel 1, therefore it is<br>
transmitted via the distributor 103 to the first program<br>
data storing unit 104-1 the program B is the program data<br>
to be transmitted via the channel 2, therefore it is<br>
transmitted via the distributor 103 to the second program<br>
data storing unit 104 2, and the program C is the program<br>
data to be transmitted via the channel 3, therefore it is<br>
transmitted via the distributor 103 to the first program<br>
data storing unit 104 <br>
Next, the CM data to be transmitted together with<br>
each series of program data are input.<br>
The CM data, similar to the usual program data, is<br>
reproduced from the magnetic tape on which they are<br>
recorded by the VTR 101 and compressed by the first image<br>
encoder 102. Then, the compressed CM data is successively<br>
stored starting from the first CM data storing unit 105-1.<br>
More specifically, the CM data of the CM 1 is stored in the<br>
first CM data storing unit 105-1, and the CM data of CM 2<br>
is stored in the second CM data storing unit 105 2.<br>
This ends the preparation of the transmission data.<br>
When the program data is transmitted, the first<br>
selecting switch 108-1 to the third selecting switch 108 3<br>
are switched to the a. side, and the program data stored<br>
in the first to third program data storing units 104-1 to<br>
104 3 are selected. Further, the fourth selecting switch<br>
108.4 is switched to the b side, and the live broadcast<br>
program received at the receiving unit 106 is selected.<br>
The control unit 120 controls the first to n-th selecting<br>
switches 108-1 to 108 n based on data indicating the<br>
transmitting form inputted by the input unit.<br>
Then, eight minutes before the time when the program<br>
data is scheduled to be provided, as shown in Fig. 3, if<br>
the program air time is 0:00, the transmission of the CM<br>
data is first started from the time 23:52 via the channel<br>
1 and the channel 2. More specifically, the CM data stored<br>
in the first CM data storing unit 105-1 and the second CM<br>
data storing unit 1052 is reproduced, and the reproduced<br>
CM data is inputted to the first transmission use encoder<br>
110.! and the second transmission use encoder 110 2 via the<br>
first multiplexing unit 109-1and the second multiplexing<br>
unit 109 2. In the first transmission use encoder 110-1 and<br>
the second transmission use encoder 110_2, the AV data of<br>
that CM is encoded. The transmission signals of the<br>
channel 1 and the channel 2 are multiplexed at the<br>
transmission use multiplexing unit 111 and transmitted by<br>
the transmitting unit 112.<br>
Next, eight minutes after this, that is, when the<br>
time becomes 0:00, the main program covered by the<br>
transmission is transmitted. The programs A to C stored<br>
in the first to third program data storing units 104^ to<br>
104 3 are reproduced, and the reproduced series of program<br>
data are inputted via the first to third selecting<br>
switches 108-1to 108.3 to the first to third multiplexing<br>
units 109 L to 109 3. Further, for the live broadcast<br>
program D received at the receiving unit 106, for<br>
example, a sports broadcast, the video data is compressed<br>
in the second image encoder 107 and inputted via the<br>
fourth selecting switch 1084 to the fourth multiplexing<br>
unit 109,4.<br>
Then, the program data inputted to the first to<br>
fourth multiplexing units 109-1 to 109.4 are encoded at the<br>
first to fourth transmission use encoders 110^ to 110 4,<br>
multiplexed at the transmission use multiplexing unit<br>
111, and transmitted from the transmitting unit 112.<br>
By such processing, the AV data transmitting<br>
apparatus lOOa generates and transmits the data stream of<br>
the programs shown in Fig. 3.<br>
Note that, it is also possible that an AV data<br>
receiving apparatus 200a, explained later, provides the<br>
insertion condition data indicating insertion timing<br>
and/or insertion quantity of the insertion of the CM data<br>
into the program data to this AV data transmitting<br>
apparatus lOOa, the control unit 120 of the AV data<br>
transmitting apparatus lOOa receives the insertion<br>
condition data via the input terminal 124, the control<br>
unit 120 controls the operation of the first to n-th<br>
program data storing units 104-1 to 104 n, the first to n-1<br>
th CM data storing units 105-1 to 105.n, and the first to<br>
h-th selecting switches 108^ to 108 n based on the<br>
insertion condition data to multiplex the CM data and the<br>
program data to satisfy the condition, and the<br>
multiplexed CM data and program data are transmitted to<br>
the AV data receiving apparatus 20Oa.<br>
Next, an explanation will be made of one embodiment<br>
of the AV data receiving apparatus of the present<br>
invention.<br>
Figure 4 is a block diagram of the configuration of<br>
the AV data receiving apparatus 200a.<br>
The AV data receiving apparatus 200a comprises a<br>
receiving state Information transmitting unit 201, a<br>
receiving unit 202, a selecting unit 203, a communication<br>
code decoder 205, a storing unit 207, an image decoder<br>
208, and a control unit 209.<br>
Note that the AV data receiving apparatus 200a has<br>
connected to it a monitor 300 and a command input unit<br>
301. The viewer selects a desired program and a method of<br>
insertion of CMs with respect to that program, the amount<br>
of insertion, and the type of CMs by the command input<br>
unit 301 and views the program and CMs displayed on the<br>
monitor 300.<br>
First, an explanation will be made of the<br>
configuration of the units.<br>
The receiving state information transmitting unit 201<br>
is a transmitting apparatus for transmitting the program<br>
received at the AV data receiving apparatus 200 and<br>
information such as the selected amount of the CMs, type,<br>
and method of insertion thereof to the originating side<br>
of the AV data. The receiving state information is<br>
inputted to the input terminal 124 of the control unit<br>
120 of the AV data transmitting apparatus lOOa as the<br>
originating side via for example a telephone line. Note<br>
that, this information is used for obtaining a grasp of<br>
the state of reception for every user at the originating<br>
side and as the basic information for charges in the pay<br>
system.<br>
And the receiving state information data are stored<br>
by the external storing unit 121 into, for example, the<br>
floppy disk 122 with the user Identification code data<br>
which is added to the Information and transmitted.<br>
The receiving unit 202 receives the signal<br>
transmitted from the AV data transmitting apparatus lOOa,<br>
separates the multiplexed signals of the channels, and<br>
outputs the results to the selecting unit 203. The<br>
receiving unit 202 is controlled by a control signal<br>
generated at the control unit 209 based on the program<br>
selection signal inputted by the viewer from the command<br>
input unit 301.<br>
The selecting unit 203 selects the signal of one<br>
channel from among the signals of a plurality of channels<br>
inputted from the receiving unit 202 and outputs the<br>
result to the communication code decoder 205. This one<br>
channel is also selected out based on the control signal<br>
from the control unit 209.<br>
The communication code decoder 205 decodes the<br>
reception signal inputted from the selecting unit 203,<br>
returns this to a program data stream or CM data stream,<br>
and outputs the result to the storing unit 207.<br>
The storing unit 207 is a storage means for storing<br>
the program data stream and CM data stream inputted from<br>
the communication code decoder 205. In the present<br>
embodiment, the storing unit 207 has a storage capacity<br>
enough to store 20 minutes worth of AV data. Further, the<br>
storing unit 207 is constituted by a memory which can<br>
simultaneously input and output data such as a dual port<br>
RAM and can simultaneously input the data from the<br>
communication code decoder 205 and output the data to the<br>
image decoder 208. Further, it is also possible for the<br>
storing unit 207 to pass the input data therethrough and<br>
immediately output the same to the image decoder 208.<br>
The image decoder 208 successively reads the program<br>
data and CM data stored in the storing unit 207 based on<br>
the control signal from the control unit 209 and decodes<br>
that video data. In the AV data transmitting apparatus<br>
lOOa, the video data is compressed by MPE62 and<br>
transmitted, therefore, in the image decoder 208, the<br>
video data compressed by that MPEG2 is expanded and<br>
returned to the original video data. The decoded program<br>
data of the video data is outputted from the AV data<br>
receiving apparatus 200a to provide the monitor 300, and is<br>
outputted so that it can be viewed by the monitor 300.<br>
The control unit 209 controls the units constituting<br>
the AV data receiving apparatus 200a to perform the<br>
desired operations.<br>
More specifically, for example, the reception<br>
condition such as the reception channel is set in the<br>
receiving unit 202 so that the channel group containing<br>
the desired program can be received based on a program<br>
selection signal inputted by the receiver from the<br>
command input unit 301.<br>
Further, the control unit 209 controls the selection<br>
operation of the reception signal in the selecting unit<br>
203. The selecting unit 203 selects any single type of<br>
CMs from among a plurality of CMs transmitted via a<br>
plurality of channels before the transmission of the<br>
program based on the selection information of the type of<br>
CMs inputted by the receiver from the command input unit<br>
301.<br>
Further, the control unit 209 controls the storing<br>
unit 207 and adjusts things so that the data of CMs or<br>
program which was received is reproduced in the form<br>
intended by the receiver. Namely, it adjusts whether the<br>
AV data inputted from the communication code decoder 205<br>
is outputted to the image decoder 208 as it is or stored<br>
in the storing unit 207. Further, simultaneously, it<br>
adjusts whether the AV data stored in the storing unit<br>
207 is outputted as the AV data outputted to the image<br>
decoder 208 or the AV data inputted from the<br>
communication code decoder 205 is outputted as it is.<br>
Next, an explanation will be made of the operation of<br>
the AV data receiving apparatus 200a.<br>
In the AV data receiving apparatus 200a of the<br>
present embodiment, the amount of viewing of CMs can be<br>
selected according to the number of times of insertion of<br>
CMs and the length of CMs per time. Further, when<br>
inserting the CM programs, it can be selected whether to<br>
insert them at predetermined positions which are<br>
determined in advance or to insert them at any selected<br>
time. Further, where the program to be audited is a live<br>
broadcast program such as a sports broadcast, it can be<br>
selected whether to ignore the AV data broadcasted during<br>
the periods when the CMs were inserted and view the<br>
program in real time or to view the AV data broadcasted<br>
during the insertion of CMs later after the end of the CMs.<br>
Note that, it is assumed that the AV data receiving<br>
apparatus 200a receives the transmission data as shown in<br>
Fig. 3.<br>
Below, an explanation will be made of the operation<br>
of the AV data receiving apparatus 200a in each selection<br>
state as shown in Fig. 5 by referring to the reproduction<br>
state of the AV data in accordance with the selection<br>
condition of the receiver.<br>
Figure 5A is a view of the state of the AV data<br>
outputted from the AV data receiving apparatus 200a when<br>
the receiver desires to view the program A without<br>
insertion of CHs. In this case, in the AV data receiving<br>
apparatus 200a, chanel 1 (chl) is selected from the time<br>
0:00 in the selecting unit 203, the reception signal<br>
thereof is decoded at the communication code decoder 205,<br>
and the decoded AV data is not stored in the storing unit<br>
207, but immediately inputted to the image decoder 208.<br>
Then, in the image decoder 208, the video data is decoded<br>
and outputted to the monitor 300. As a result, the<br>
program A is started from the time 0:00 as illustrated<br>
and the program A is outputted without interruption until<br>
the time 2:00.<br>
Figure 5B is a view of the state of the AV data<br>
outputted from the AV data receiving apparatus 200a when<br>
the receiver desires to view the program A with the CM 1<br>
of a comparatively small number of times of insertion and<br>
a short time per insertion inserted at predetermined times.<br>
In this case, in the AV data receiving apparatus 200a,<br>
the chl through which the AV data of CM 1 is transmitted-1is<br>
selected at the selecting unit 203 from the time 23:52 at<br>
which the transmission of CM is started and the reception<br>
of that data is started. The AV data of the received CM 1<br>
is successively stored in the storing unit 207.<br>
When the time becomes 0:00, the same ohl through<br>
which the AV data of the program A is transmitted is<br>
selected at the selecting unit 203 and the reception of<br>
that data is started. The AV data of the received program<br>
A is stored in the storing unit 207. Further, when the<br>
time becomes 0:00, the output of the CM 1 which has been<br>
already stored in the storing unit 207 is started from<br>
the storing unit 207. Namely, the data of CM 1 is read<br>
from the storing unit 207 and outputted via, the image<br>
decoder 208 to the monitor 300. When the CM1 is outputted<br>
for 30 seconds, the storing unit 207 starts the output of<br>
the AV data of the program A received and stored at the<br>
time 0:00. Accordingly, AV data delayed from the reception<br>
time by 30 seconds is outputted from the storing unit 207.<br>
When the time becomes 0:30, the storing unit 207<br>
interrupts the output of the program A again and outputs<br>
the data subsequent to the CM 1 for 30 seconds. As a<br>
result, a CM of 30 seconds is outputted again to the<br>
viewer at the time 0:30. The AV data of the program A<br>
received during this time is stored in the storing unit<br>
207. Then, when the time becomes 0:30:30, the storing<br>
unit 207 starts the output of the AV data of the program A<br>
received and stored one minute before this time.<br>
27<br>
Below, similarly, AV data of 30 seconds each is<br>
inserted at the time 1:00 and 1:30. As a result, the output<br>
AV data becomes as shown in Fig. SB. Namely, the viewer<br>
views a CM of 30 seconds every 30 minutes and can end the<br>
viewing of the program A at the time 2:02.<br>
Note that, to enable such a reception, the storing<br>
unit 207 must have a storage capacity enough to store<br>
data of at least the amount of output of the CM 1, that<br>
is, two minutes.<br>
Figure 5C is a view of the state of the AV data<br>
outputted from the AV data receiving apparatus 200a when<br>
the receiver desires to view the program A with the CM 1<br>
of a comparatively large number of times of insertion but<br>
short time per insertion Inserted. The basic operation in<br>
this case is the same as the case of Fig. 5B. First, from<br>
the time 23:52 at which the transmission of the CM is<br>
started, the chl through which the AV data of the CM 1 is<br>
transmitted is selected at the selecting unit 203, the<br>
reception of the CM 1 is started, and the AV data is<br>
stored in the storing unit 207.<br>
When the time becomes 0:00, the same chl through<br>
which the AV data of the program A is transmitted is<br>
selected at the selecting unit 203, the reception of the<br>
data is started, and the AV data of the program A is<br>
stored in the storing unit 207. Further, the output of<br>
the CM 1 is started from the storing unit 207. Then, when<br>
the CM 1 is outputted for 30 seconds, the output of the<br>
AV data of the program A received at time 0:00 is started.<br>
Then, in the reception state of Fig. 5C, the output<br>
of the program A is interrupted when the time becomes<br>
0:15, and the data subsequent to the CM1 is outputted for<br>
30 seconds. As a result, a CM of 30 seconds is outputted<br>
again to the viewer at the time 0:15. Below, similarly, AV<br>
data of 30 seconds each is Inserted at the time 0:30, 0:45,<br>
1:00, 1:15, 1:30, and 1:45. As a result, the output AV data<br>
becomes as shown in Fig. 5C, and the viewer views a CM of<br>
30 seconds every 15 minutes, i.e., eight times in all, and<br>
finishes viewing the program A at the time 2:04.<br>
Note that, so as to enable such reception, the<br>
storing unit 207 must have a storage capacity enough to<br>
store AV data of at least the amount of output of the CM<br>
1, that is, four minutes.<br>
Figure 5D is a view of the state of the AV data<br>
outputted from the AV data receiving apparatus 200a when<br>
the receiver selects such the method of viewing where a<br>
relatively large number of CMs are inserted. In this case<br>
as well, the basic operation is the same as those of the<br>
cases of Figs. 5B and 5C, but the output time per<br>
insertion of CMs becomes one minute. Namely, in this<br>
case, the AV data receiving apparatus 200a outputs the CM<br>
1 for one minute from the time 0:00 and then starts the<br>
output of the AV data of the program A received at the<br>
time 0:00. The viewer views a one minute CM every 15<br>
minutes, i.e., eight times in all, and finishes viewing the<br>
program A at the time 2:08.<br>
Note that, so as to enable such reception, the<br>
storing unit 207 must have a storage capacity enough to<br>
store AV data of at least the amount of output of the CM<br>
1, that is, eight minutes.<br>
In Fig. 5E, the amount of CMs and insertion method<br>
are the same as those of the case of Fig. 5D, but the<br>
type of the selected CM is different. Namely, it is a<br>
view of the state of the AV data outputted from the AV<br>
data receiving apparatus 200a when the viewer desires to<br>
view the CM 2. In this case, in the AV data receiving<br>
apparatus 200a, channel 2 (ch2) through which the AV data<br>
of CM 2 is transmitted is selected in the selecting unit<br>
203 from the time 23:52 at which the transmission of CM<br>
is started and the reception of that data is started. The<br>
AV data of the received CM 2 is successively stored in<br>
the storing unit 207.<br>
When the time becomes 0:00, the chl through which the<br>
AV data of the program A is transmitted is selected in<br>
the selecting unit 203 and the reception of that data is<br>
started. The AV data of the received program A is stored<br>
JU<br>
in the storing unit 207. Then, from the time 0:00, the<br>
output of the CM 2 which has been already stored in the<br>
storing unit 207 is started. Namely, the AV data of CM 2<br>
is read from the storing unit 207 and outputted via the<br>
image decoder 208 to the monitor 300. Then, when the CM 2<br>
is outputted for one minute, the storing unit 207 outputs<br>
the AV data of the program A received and stored at the<br>
time 0:00. The rest of the operation is the same as that of<br>
the case of Fig. 5D explained before.<br>
Figure 5F shows a case where the viewer desires to<br>
view the program with the CM 1 inserted so that the<br>
amount becomes as small as possible, that is, both the<br>
number of times of insertion is small and the time per<br>
insertion is short, similar to the case of Fig. 5B except<br>
the CMs are inserted at any desired time.<br>
In this case as well, the ohl through which the AV<br>
data of the CM 1 is transmitted is selected at the<br>
selecting unit 203 from the time 23:52 at which the<br>
transmission of the CM is started, the reception of that<br>
data is started, and the received data is stored in the<br>
storing unit 207. When the time becomes 0:00, the chl<br>
through which the data of the program A is transmitted is<br>
selected and the received data is stored in the storing<br>
unit 207 and, at the same time, the output of the CM 1<br>
which has been already stored in the storing unit 207 is<br>
started. Then, when the CM 1 is outputted for 30 seconds,<br>
the output of the AV data of the program A which was<br>
received and stored at the time 0:00 is started.<br>
Thereafter, when the control unit 209 outputs the<br>
control signal for CM Insertion to the storing unit 207<br>
based on the CM insertion command inputted to the control<br>
unit 209 at any desired time, the storing unit 207<br>
Interrupts the output of the program A and outputs the<br>
data subsequent to the CM 1 for 30 seconds. The AV data<br>
of the program A received during this time is stored in<br>
the storing unit 207. Below, similarly, the CMs are<br>
inserted based on CM insertion commands generated at any<br>
desired time.<br>
In the present embodiment, it is assumed that the CM<br>
insertion command is inputted from the command input unit<br>
301 by the viewer. Namely, the viewer can view the CMs at<br>
any optional desired time while viewing the program.<br>
Note that, this CM Insertion command may be inputted<br>
superimposed on the transmitted AV data or may be<br>
generated by any method.<br>
Figures 5G and 5H show the case where the method of<br>
insertion of the CMs can be selected when viewing a live<br>
broadcast program or the like.<br>
In Fig. 5G, the AV data received during the<br>
insertion of a CM is not output, but the AV data at the<br>
point of time of reception is outputted as the program.<br>
Namely, the program is outputted respecting the real time<br>
property.<br>
In this case as well, the chl through which the AV<br>
data of the CM1 is transmitted is selected at the<br>
selecting unit 203 from the time 23:52 at which the<br>
transmission of CM is started, the reception of that data<br>
is started, and the received data is stored in the<br>
storing unit 207. When the time becomes 0:00, the<br>
selecting unit 203 selects the channel 4 (ch4) through<br>
which the data of program D, that is, a live broadcast<br>
program, is transmitted, but does not store the received<br>
data. On the other hand, it starts the output of the CM 1<br>
which has been already stored in the storing unit 207.<br>
Then, when outputting the CM 1 for 30 seconds, it outputs<br>
the AV data of the program A received through the oh4 as<br>
it is.<br>
Next, based on for example a CM insertion command<br>
superimposed on the data of the program to be received,<br>
when the time becomes the time for insertion of a CM, the<br>
storing unit 207 outputs the 30 seconds of data<br>
subsequent to the CM 1 which has been already stored. The<br>
output of the program D is interrupted during this time.<br>
The AV data of the program D during the interruption is<br>
discarded as it is. Then, when the CM is ended, the AV<br>
data of the received program D is outputted again from<br>
that point of time.<br>
In this way, in the method of viewing of a program as<br>
shown in Fig. 5G, while it becomes impossible to view the<br>
program during a CM, it becomes possible to view the<br>
received AV data in real time.<br>
In Fig. 5H, the AV data received during the<br>
insertion of a CM is stored and outputted without<br>
breakage of the continuity of the received AV data.<br>
From the time 23:52 at which the transmission of CM<br>
is started, the chl through which the AV data of the CM1 is<br>
transmitted is selected at the selecting unit 203, the<br>
reception of that data is started, and the received data<br>
is stored in the storing unit 207. When the time becomes<br>
0:00, the selecting unit 203 selects the ch4 through<br>
which the data of program D, that is, the live broadcast<br>
program, is transmitted, and successively stores the data<br>
received during this time in the storing unit 207. Then,<br>
it starts the output of the CM 1 which has been already<br>
stored in the storing unit 207. Then, when outputting the<br>
CM I for 30 seconds, it outputs the AV data of the<br>
program D received 30 seconds before which is stored in<br>
the storing unit 207.<br>
Then, based on for example a CM insertion command<br>
superimposed on the data of the program to be received.<br>
when the time becomes the time for insertion of a CM, the<br>
storing unit 207 outputs the 30 seconds of data<br>
subsequent to the CM 1 which has been already stored.<br>
Also, during this period, the received AV data of the<br>
program D is successively stored in the storing unit 207.<br>
When the CM is ended, the data subsequent to the program<br>
D stored in the storing unit 207 is output.<br>
In this way, in the method of viewing a program as in<br>
Fig. 5H, the real time property of the program D is lost,<br>
but it becomes possible to view the data while<br>
maintaining continuity without missing any part of the<br>
program.<br>
If the AV data transmitted by the AV data<br>
transmitting apparatus lOOa of the present embodiment as<br>
mentioned before is received and the program is viewed by<br>
the AV data receiving apparatus 200a of the present<br>
embodiment in this way, the amount, the type, and the<br>
form of insertion of the CMs, that is, AV data of the<br>
ancillary object of transmission, and the form of output<br>
of the program, that is, the AV data of the main object<br>
of transmission, can be controlled to any form and the AV<br>
data can be received in the form desired by the viewer.<br>
Further, in the AV data receiving apparatus 200a of<br>
the present embodiment, the form of reception selected by<br>
the viewer can be transmitted to the transmission side.<br>
therefore the form of reception of each viewer can be<br>
precisely grasped at the transmission side.<br>
Next, an explanation will be made of embodiments of<br>
the other operation of the AV data transmitting apparatus<br>
lOOa shown in Fig. 1.<br>
In the embodiment of the operation of the AV data<br>
transmitting apparatus lOOa mentioned above, however, the<br>
AV data of the CMs reproduced at the VTR 101 and encoded<br>
at the image encoder 102 was switched by the distributor<br>
103 and stored in any one of the n number of CM data<br>
storing units 105-1 to 105_n. More specifically, a<br>
plurality of CMs which are successively reproduced were<br>
successively stored starting from the first CM data<br>
storing unit 105-1<br>
In the embodiment of operation, being explained here,<br>
of the AV data transmitting apparatus lOOa, when<br>
generating the AV data of a CM, the AV data of the CM is<br>
outputted to and stored in the CM data storing units 105-1<br>
( i = l t o m ; m s n ) o f all channels through which the<br>
program data of the main object of transmission is<br>
transmitted. In the transmission data, as shown in Fig.<br>
6, all CMs which may be selected are added before each<br>
program data for every channel, and the resultant data is<br>
transmitted.<br>
In the embodiment of operation, explained referring<br>
to Fig. 3, of the AV data transmitting apparatus lOOa of<br>
the first embodiment, as shown in Fig. 3, the CMs and main<br>
program are considered to be completely independent from<br>
each other, and the CMs were transmitted through any<br>
channel. As a result, even if the viewer selected to view<br>
the program B, if the selected CM was the CM 1, the viewer<br>
had to select chl first until the time 0:00, and had to<br>
select the channel through which the program of the main<br>
object of transmission was transmitted at the time after<br>
0:00.<br>
In the other embodiment of operation, being explained<br>
referring to Fig. 6, of the AV data transmitting apparatus<br>
100, however, when the viewer selects the channel through<br>
which the program selected by the viewer is transmitted<br>
first, all CMs enabling the viewing of the program in the<br>
desired form as mentioned before can be received for every<br>
channel. As a result, in the AV data receiving apparatus<br>
200a, fine control with respect to the selecting unit 203<br>
becomes unnecessary.<br>
An explanation will next be made of still another<br>
embodiment of operation of the AV data transmitting<br>
apparatus.<br>
In this embodiment, the functions of the first to<br>
n-th multiplexing units 109 are different from that of the<br>
embodiments mentioned above. Further, in this embodiment.<br>
the format of the transmission data is different from the<br>
format of the embodiments mentioned before.<br>
The multiplexing unit 109 of the present embodiment<br>
does not transmit the data of the CM first and then<br>
transmit the data of the program of the main object of<br>
transmission, but multiplexes the data of the CM in the<br>
data of the program for transmission.<br>
In the still another embodiment of operation of the<br>
AV data transmitting apparatus 100 the data of the program<br>
is stored in the program data storing unit 104-1, and the<br>
data of the CMs is stored in the CM data storing unit<br>
105-1 for each channel. Then, in the multiplexing unit<br>
109-1, part of the data of the CMs read from the CM data<br>
storing unit 105-1 is Inserted in the vertical<br>
synchronization of the video data read from the program<br>
data storing unit 104-1, and the AV data of the program<br>
and the AV data of the CM are multiplexed. More<br>
specifically, as shown in Fig. 7A, the 20 lines worth of<br>
the CM data are inserted during one field of the program<br>
data.<br>
As a result, as shown in Fig. 7B, when it is<br>
assumed that the number of the valid lines is 480 lines<br>
(case of an NTSC signal), the video data of one frame of<br>
a CM is transmitted by 12 frames (24 fields). Further,<br>
the audio data and control information for a frame of the<br>
CM become an amount of information that can be<br>
transmitted by 3 frames worth of the program data. For<br>
this reason, in the end, as shown in Fig. 7B, data of an<br>
amount of one frame of a CM is multiplexed in 15 frames<br>
of the program data. As a result, as shown in Fig. 7C, it<br>
becomes possible to multiplex one CM of 15 seconds with<br>
program data of a length of 225 seconds, and four CMs of<br>
15 seconds with program data of 15 minutes, that is, one<br>
minute of CMs.<br>
The data multiplexed in this way is generated at the<br>
multiplexing unit 109 and then similarly encoded at the<br>
transmission use encoder 110. Signals of each channel are<br>
multiplexed at the transmission use multiplexing unit <br>
and transmitted from the transmitting unit 112. As a<br>
result, the data in which the program and CM are<br>
multiplexed as shown in Fig. 8 is transmitted. When<br>
adopting such a configuration, it becomes possible for<br>
the viewer to adequately view the program even in a case<br>
where viewing of the program is required immediately<br>
before the time 0:00, etc.<br>
An explanation will be made of another embodiment of<br>
the AV data transmitting apparatus of the present<br>
invention.<br>
The configuration of the AV data transmitting<br>
apparatus lOOb of the another embodiment is shown in Fig.<br>
9.<br>
The AV data transmitting apparatus lOOb shown in Fig.<br>
9 comprises a configuration in which the first to n-th CM<br>
data storing units 105-1 to 105_n and first to n-th<br>
multiplexing units 109-1to 109 n of the AV data<br>
transmitting apparatus 10Oa are omitted.<br>
The same portions with the configuration of the AV<br>
data transmitting apparatus lOOa shown in Fig. 1 are<br>
added the same reference number, and the explanation of<br>
the portions are omitted.<br>
In an AV data transmitting apparatus lOOb of such a<br>
configuration, a CM is treated as a program and the AV<br>
data is transmitted providing a private channel for the<br>
CMs. Namely, when reproducing a CM at the VTR 101, the AV<br>
data encoded at the image encoder 102 thereof is all<br>
stored in the fifth program data storing unit 104 ...<br>
Then, at the transmission of the AV data, the CM data<br>
stored in this fifth program data storing unit 104 5 is<br>
repeatedly read and transmitted via the channel 5 (ch5)<br>
in parallel with the transmission of the program A to<br>
program D stored in the first to fourth program data<br>
storing units 104-1 to 104 4.<br>
The state of transmission of that AV data is shown in<br>
Fig. 10.<br>
As shown in Fig. 10, similar to the above<br>
embodiment, from the time 0:00, the transmission of the<br>
program A to program D is started through chl to ch4. Then,<br>
further, the CM data is repeatedly transmitted to the ch5.<br>
Even if the program data and the CM data are<br>
transmitted by adopting such a configuration, processing<br>
similar to that of the case where the AV data is<br>
transmitted by the AV data transmitting apparatuses of<br>
the above embodiments is possible.<br>
Then, when adopting such a form of transmission, the<br>
AV data transmitting apparatus 100 does not require the n<br>
number of CM data storing units 105 and n number of<br>
multiplexing units 109 and therefore the configuration of<br>
the apparatus becomes simpler.<br>
An explanation will next be made of a modification of<br>
the AV data receiving apparatus shown in Fig. 4.<br>
The AV data receiving apparatus 200b of this modified<br>
embodiment receives the AV data of the main program and<br>
the CM data transmitted as shown in Fig. 10 by the AV<br>
data transmitting apparatus lOOb as shown in Fig. 9 and<br>
outputs the result to the monitor 300 in the desired<br>
form.<br>
Figure 11 is a block diagram of the configuration of<br>
that AV data receiving apparatus 200b.<br>
The AV data receiving apparatus 200b further<br>
comprises a second selecting unit 204 and a second<br>
communication code decoder 206 in addition to the<br>
configuration of the AV data receiving apparatus 200a<br>
shown in Fig. 4.<br>
The first selecting unit 203 selects the signal of<br>
the channel through which the program of the main object<br>
of transmission is transmitted from among the signals of<br>
a plurality of channels inputted from the receiving unit<br>
202 and outputs the result to the first communication<br>
code decoder 205.<br>
Further, the second selecting unit 204 always selects<br>
the channel through which the AV data of the CMs is<br>
transmitted from among the signals of a plurality of<br>
channels received at the receiving unit 202 and outputs<br>
the result to the second communication code decoder 206.<br>
The first communication code decoder 205 decodes the<br>
reception signal inputted from the first selecting unit<br>
203, returns this to the program data stream, and outputs<br>
the result to the storing unit 207.<br>
Further, the second communication code decoder 206<br>
decodes the CM data inputted from the second selecting<br>
unit 204, returns this to the CM data stream, and outputs<br>
the result to the storing unit 207.<br>
In the storing unit 207, when the time becomes 0:00,<br>
first, the CM data inputted from the second communication<br>
code decoder 206 is outputted to the image decoder 208 as<br>
it is for 30 seconds. During this time, the AV data of<br>
the desired program inputted from the first communication<br>
code decoder 205 is stored in the storing unit 207. When<br>
the CM is outputted for 30 seconds and the time becomes<br>
0:00:30, the storing unit 207 starts the output of the AV<br>
data of the desired program of 30 seconds before which<br>
was received from the time 0:00 and has been already stored<br>
in the storing unit 207. Note that, even during this<br>
period, the AV data inputted from the communication code<br>
decoder 205 to the storing unit 207 is successively<br>
stored in the storing unit 207. At this time, in the<br>
storing unit 207, 30 seconds worth of the AV data is<br>
always stored.<br>
Then, when the time becomes 0:30, the storing unit<br>
207 selects the AV data of the CMs inputted from the<br>
second communication code decoder 206 again and outputs<br>
this to the image decoder 208. During this time, the AV<br>
data inputted from the first communication code decoder<br>
205 is successively stored in the storing unit 207. When<br>
the output of 30 seconds of the CMs is ended, the storing<br>
unit 207 outputs the AV data of the desired program which<br>
is stored. At this time, in the storing unit 207, one<br>
minute of the AV data is always stored.<br>
Below, similarly, when the CM is output, the AV data<br>
from the second communication code decoder 206 is<br>
selected, and the AV data of the program during this<br>
period is stored in the storing unit 207. By doing this,<br>
the AV data can be outputted in the form as shown in Fig.<br>
5B.<br>
Note that, in this explanation, the explanation was<br>
made of a case where the signal of the format as shown in<br>
Fig. 10 was received and the program and CM were<br>
outputted in the form as shown in Fig. SB, but similar to<br>
the AV data receiving apparatus 200a shown in Fig. 4, the<br>
AV data can be outputted in any form of Figs. 5A to 5H in<br>
accordance with the requirement of the viewer.<br>
Further, when CM data and program data are<br>
multiplexed based on the insertion condition data to<br>
satisfy the insertion condition by the AV data<br>
transmitting apparatus lOOa and are transmitted to the AV<br>
data receiving apparatus 200a or 200b, the operation that<br>
the CM data are inserted into the program data based on<br>
the insertion condition is not necessary in the AV data<br>
receiving apparatus 200a or 200b so that the AV data<br>
receiving apparatus 200a or 200b is only to display the<br>
received CM data and program data. Note, in this case,<br>
the insertion condition data are inputted in advance from<br>
the command input unit 301 before the reception of the CM<br>
data and the program data. The Inputted Insertion<br>
condition data are provided to the receiving state<br>
44<br>
information transmitting apparatus 201 via control unit<br>
209 and transmitted to the control unit 120 of the AV<br>
data transmitting apparatus lOOa via communication line<br>
said as telephone line.<br>
Further, by the external storing unit 121 of the AV<br>
data transmitting apparatus lOOa or lOOb, the data<br>
indicating the quantity, the types and the insertion<br>
method etc. of the CM data selected with program data by<br>
each viewers are stored in, for example, the floppy disk<br>
121. Accordingly, the provided using the AV data<br>
transmitting apparatus lOOa or lOOb commercially can get<br>
the information of such as the quantity, the types and<br>
the insertion method etc. of the CM data selected with<br>
received program data easily based on the data to use the<br>
information as the basic information for charge. The<br>
charge demanding systems, such as demanding the payment<br>
corresponding to the ratio of the program data viewing time<br>
and the CM data viewing time to the viewers, demanding<br>
the payment determined with the type of the program data<br>
and the CM data viewed by the viewer, and demanding the<br>
payment determined with the type and amount of the<br>
program data and the CM data viewed by the viewer, can be<br>
realized easily.<br>
Note that, the AV data transmitting apparatus of the<br>
present invention is not limited to the first to fourth<br>
embodiments. Various modlfioations are possible.<br>
For example, in the present embodiment, a Magnetic<br>
tape on which the program data scheduled to be<br>
transmitted was reproduced from by a VTR apparatus and<br>
the program data was read and fetched into an AV data<br>
transmitting apparatus. However, it is also possible to<br>
reproduce the data from other recording media or to<br>
directly supply the program data from for example a video<br>
library of a large capacity.<br>
Further, the method of encoding the video data in the<br>
image encoder is not limited to the MPE62 method and may<br>
be any method. Further, where program data which has been<br>
already compressed is supplied to the program data<br>
transmitting apparatus, even a configuration in which the<br>
image encoder is substantially omitted can be adopted.<br>
Further, in the AV data transmitting apparatus lOOa<br>
shown in Fig. 2, program data of a plurality of channels<br>
were multiplexed and transmitted, but it is also possible<br>
to transmit them by completely independent systems.<br>
Namely, the signal format at actual transmission may be<br>
any format. Further, the configuration of the receiving<br>
unit 202 of the AV data receiving apparatus 200a shown in<br>
Fig. 4 can be freely changed in accordance with the<br>
transmission signal.<br>
Further, the communication between the AV data<br>
transmitting apparatus 100 and the AV data receiving<br>
apparatus 200 is not limited the telephone line. The<br>
radio system and the satellite communication system can be<br>
used.<br>
According to the AV data transmitting apparatus and<br>
AV data receiving apparatus of the present invention and<br>
the broadcasting system constituted by them, it becomes<br>
possible to view a desired program in a form in<br>
accordance with the requirement of the viewer in a state<br>
with CMs appropriately inserted.<br><br><br><br>
