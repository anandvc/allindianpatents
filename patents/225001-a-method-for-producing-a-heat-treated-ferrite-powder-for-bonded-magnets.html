				<td>The present invention relates to a method for producing a heat-treated ferrite<br>
powder for bonded magnets.<br>
The present invention relates to a high-performance bonded magnet<br>
useful for wide ranges of magnet applications such as various rotors,<br>
magnet rolls for electromagnetic developing-type printers and photocopiers,<br>
audio speakers, buzzers, attracting or magnetic field-generating magnets<br>
and having a higher residual magnetic flux density Br (or higher residual<br>
magnetic flux density Br and coercivity iHc) than those of the conventional<br>
Sr and/or Ba ferrite powders, and a ferrite powder used therefor and a<br>
method for producing such a bonded magnet and a ferrite powder, more<br>
particularly to a magnet roll composed of such a high-performance bonded<br>
magnet and a method for producing such a magnet roll.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
As well known, bonded magnets are lighter in weight and higher in<br>
dimensional accuracy than sintered magnets and suitable for mass<br>
production of articles having complicated shapes, and therefore they are<br>
widely used for various magnet applications. Recently, magnet-applied<br>
products have been drastically miniaturized and reduced in weight,<br>
requiring high-performance ferrite bonded magnets having a higher Br (or<br>
higher Br and iHc) suitable for miniaturization and reduction in weight.<br>
Conventional Sr and/or Ba ferrite bonded magnets are obtained by<br>
bonding Sr and/or Ba ferrite powder having a composition represented by<br>
AO.nFe2O3, wherein A is Sr and/or Ba, and n = 5-6, with binders such as<br>
thermoplastic polyolefin resins or rubbers, advantageous in low cost.<br>
However, the ferrite bonded magnets are lower in Br and maximum energy<br>
product (BH)max than sintered a ferrite powders to the extent of volume<br>
increase due to non-magnetic portions occupied by binders. To obviate<br>
this disadvantage, various attempts have been made conventionally to<br>
improve the orientation of a ferrite powder by a magnetic field or a<br>
mechanical stress applied for a ferrite powder orientation, and to improve<br>
the filling of a ferrite powder in binders. As a result, it is almost<br>
considered that no further improvement in magnetic properties would not<br>
be able to be achieved in bonded magnets comprising a ferrite powders<br>
having conventional compositions.<br>
If the filling ratio of a ferrite powder in rubbers or plastics is<br>
increased to improve the magnetic properties of bonded magnets, the<br>
resultant blends would have extremely high melt viscosity. Even though<br>
high-melt viscosity blends are subjected to practical orientating magnetic<br>
field or mechanical stress, it would be difficult to obtain bonded magnets<br>
having well-oriented a ferrite powder. This difficulty is remarkable in an<br>
injection molding method, though it is appreciable in an extrusion method<br>
and a compression molding method, too. Though the orientation of a<br>
ferrite powder in the ferrite bonded magnets is improved by increasing the<br>
filling ratio of a ferrite powder in rubbers or plastics, such improvement<br>
inevitably causes the deterioration of magnetic properties, failing to satisfy<br>
the demand of miniaturization and reduction in weight.<br>
To obviate such problems of conventional technology, it is effective<br><br>
to improve the saturation magnetization as or crystal magnetic anisotropy<br>
constant of a ferrite powder for bonded magnets. Improvement in as<br>
directly leads to improvement in coercivity Hc (or iHc). Incidentally, the<br>
conventional a ferrite powder for bonded magnets having a composition of<br>
AOnFe2O3 has a magnetoplumbite-type crystal structure, and W-type<br>
ferrite having larger as than a ferrite powder having a magnetoplumbite-<br>
type crystal structure has also been investigated. However, the mass<br>
production of the W-type ferrite cannot be materialized so far due to<br>
difficulty in the control of a sintering atmosphere.<br>
Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 9-115715 discloses a ferrite powder<br>
for bonded magnets having a main phase constituted by a hexagonal<br>
magnetoplumbite-type ferrite represented by the general formula:<br>
A1-xRx(Fe12-yMy)zO19, wherein A is at least one element selected from the<br>
group consisting of Sr, Ba, Ca and Kb, R is at least one of rare earth<br>
elements including Y, La being indispensable, M is Zn and/or Cd, and x, y<br>
and z are molar ratios meeting the conditions of 0.04=x=0.45, 0.04=y=0.45,<br>
and 0.7=z=1.2. Investigation by the inventors has revealed, however, that<br>
it is difficult to obtain bonded magnets having high Br and iHc (for<br>
instance, exceeding 3.5 kOe) from this a ferrite powder for bonded<br>
magnets.<br>
Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide a high-<br>
performance bonded magnet having a magnetoplumbite-type crystal<br>
structure suitable for mass production., which has higher Br (or higher Br<br>
and iHc) than those of conventional Sr and/or Ba ferrite bonded magnets, a<br>
magnet roll composed of such a bonded magnet, a ferrite powder used for<br>
such a bonded magnet, and methods for producing them.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The inventors have paid attention to the fact that by adding metal<br>
compounds (for instance, a combination of a La oxide and at least one<br>
oxide of Co, Mn, Ni and Zn, or a combination of a rare earth oxide mixture<br>
based on a La oxide as a main component and containing oxides of Nd, Pr,<br>
Ce, etc. and an oxide of Co and/or Zn), which have not been conventionally<br>
tried, to ferrite represented by AO-nFe2O3, wherein A is Sr and/or Ba, and n<br>
is 5-6, part of A and Fe elements in the above ferrite can be substituted by<br>
the metal elements in the metal compounds added, resulting in a ferrite<br>
powder suitable for bonded magnets, which has a magnetoplumbite-type<br>
crystal structure with a higher saturation magnetization and coercivity than<br>
those of conventional Sr and/or Ba ferrite powder.<br>
The magnetism of this magnetoplumbite-type a ferrite powder is<br>
derived from a magnetic moment of Fe ions, with a magnetic structure of a<br>
ferri-magnet in which magnetic moment is arranged partially in antiparallel<br>
by Fe ion sites. There are two methods to improve the saturation<br>
magnetization in this magnetic structure. The first method is to replace<br>
the Fe ions at sites corresponding to the antiparallel-oriented magnetic<br>
moment with another element, which has a smaller magnetic moment than<br>
Fe ions or is non-magnetic. The second method is to replace the Fe ions<br>
at sites corresponding to the parallel-oriented magnetic moment with<br>
another element having a larger magnetic moment than Fe ions.<br>
Also, increase in a crystal magnetic anisotropy constant in the<br><br>
above magnetic structure can be achieved by replacing Fe ions with another<br>
element having a stronger interaction with the crystal lattice. Specifically,<br>
Fe ions are replaced with an element in which a magnetic moment derived<br>
from an orbital angular momentum remains or is large.<br>
With the above findings in mind, research has been conducted for<br>
the purpose of replacing Fe ions with various elements by adding various<br>
metal compounds such as metal oxides. As a result, it has been found that<br>
Mn, Co and Ni are elements remarkably improving magnetic properties.<br>
However, the mere addition of the above elements would not<br>
provide a ferrite powders with fully improved magnetic properties, because<br>
the replacement of Fe ions with other elements would destroy the balance<br>
of ion valance, resulting in the generation of undesirable phases. To avoid<br>
this phenomenon, ion sites of Sr and/or Ba should be replaced with other<br>
elements for the purpose of charge compensation. For this purpose, the<br>
addition of at least one of La, Nd, Pr, Ce, etc., particularly La, is effective.<br>
That is, it has been found that a ferrite powder produced by the addition of<br>
an R element compound based on La and an M element compound (at least<br>
one of Co, Mn, Ni and Zn) provides bonded magnets having higher Br (or<br>
higher Br and iHc) than those of the conventional Sr and/or Ba ferrite<br>
bonded magnets. It has also been found that bonded magnets formed by<br>
using a ferrite powder produced by the addition of an R element compound<br>
based on La and a Co element compound and/or a Zn compound has well-<br>
balanced Br and iHc, particularly suitable for magnet rolls.<br>
Further investigation of the inventors has revealed that sufficient<br>
improvement in the magnetic properties of bonded magnets cannot be<br>
obtained only by selecting the composition of main components for ferrite.<br>
This is because the magnetic properties of bonded magnets containing a<br>
ferrite powder are largely affected not only by the basic composition of a<br>
ferrite powder but also by the amounts of impurities (particularly Si, Ca, Al,<br>
Cr) in the ferrite powder.<br>
In general, when magnetically isotropic ferrite obtained by a<br>
ferritization reaction is pulverized to fine particles having particle sizes<br>
substantially corresponding to the single magnetic domain size and then<br>
heat-treated, the resultant a ferrite powder for bonded magnets has<br>
improved magnetic properties. Investigation of the inventors has also<br>
revealed that to achieve as high Br as corresponding to a Br potential<br>
inherent in a ferrite powder materials adjusted to have the above basic<br>
composition, the amounts of additives for forming crystal grain boundary<br>
phases such as SiO2, CaO, etc., useful for sintered a ferrite powders, and<br>
Al2O3 and/or Cr2O3 having a function to largely improve iHc though<br>
remarkably decreasing Br should be made as small as possible.<br>
The first factor affecting the amounts of inevitable impurities in<br>
ferrite powder is the purity of iron oxide. Iron oxide, which is a main<br>
component for the ferrite powder, inevitably contains inevitable impurities<br>
such as SiO2, Al2O3, Cr2O3, etc. Though the amounts of these inevitable<br>
impurities are preferably as small as possible, the used of iron oxide having<br>
higher purity than necessary for industrial production disadvantageously<br>
leads to increase in production cost. Incidentally, other starting materials<br>
than iron oxide are preferably SrCO3, La2O3, Co oxides, etc. having a purity<br>
of 99% or more.<br><br>
The second factor affecting the amounts of inevitable impurities in<br>
ferrite powder is Si, Cr, Al, etc., which may enter into the ferrite powder in<br>
the course of fine pulverization of a magnetically anisotropic ferrite<br>
composition obtained by a ferritization reaction to a single magnetic<br>
domain size or a particle size corresponding thereto. As a result of<br>
investigation by the inventors, it has been appreciated that the amounts of<br>
inevitable impurities tend to increase in the case of using a ball-milling pot<br>
or balls made of steel, which are in general widely used in the production<br>
of ferrite powder. It has been found that particularly when fine<br>
pulverization is carried out to an average diameter of about 1.3 µm or less<br>
measured by an air permeation method using a Fischer Subsieve sizer,<br>
portions in contact with the ferrite powder, such as steel balls<br>
(pulverization medium), inner walls of pulverizing chambers, etc., are<br>
extremely worn, resulting in Si, Cr and Al components entering into the<br>
ferrite powder. The extent of contamination is remarkable when the<br>
average diameter of pulverized powder is as small as 1.1 µm or less.<br>
From the aspect of commercial production, it is preferable to use<br>
usual pulverizing machines such as attritors, ball mills, vibration ball mills,<br>
etc., and also steel balls that less affect the magnetic properties of ferrite<br>
powder than ceramic balls when worn pulverization media contaminate the<br>
ferrite powder. Accordingly, it has been found to be necessary to select a<br>
type of steel that does not substantially contain Al as a material for the<br>
inner walls of pulverization chambers, pulverization media, etc., to prevent<br>
Al and other inevitable impurities from entering into the ferrite powder<br>
during a pulverization process.<br><br>
However, because the inclusion of Si and Cr components into the<br>
ferrite powder during pulverization is unavoidable due to limitations in<br>
commercial production, the permissible amounts of Si, etc. contained in the<br>
ferrite powder and the amounts of Si, etc. entering into the ferrite powder<br>
during pulverization have been taken into consideration to achieve the<br>
following findings: When iron oxide used for ferrite powder for bonded<br>
magnets has a total content of Si and Ca calculated as (SiO2 + CaO) is 0.06<br>
weight % or less and a total content of Al and Cr calculated as (Al2O3 +<br>
Cr2O3) is 0.1 weight % or less, the resultant ferrite powder contains<br>
impurities in such amounts that a total of a Si content calculated as SiO2<br>
and a Ca content calculated as CaO is 0.2 weight % or less, and a total of<br>
an Al content Al2O3 and a Cr content calculated as Cr2O3 is 0.13 weight %<br>
or less, resulting in higher Br than that of the conventional ferrite powder.<br>
The present invention has been completed based on this finding.<br>
Thus, the ferrite powder for bonded magnets according to the<br>
present invention has a substantially magnetoplumbite-type crystal<br>
structure and an average diameter of 0.9-2 µm, the ferrite powder having a<br>
basic composition represented by the following general formula:<br>
(A1-xRxO)n[(Fe1-yMy)2O3] by atomic ratio,<br>
wherein A is Sr and/or Ba; R is at least one of rare earth elements including<br>
Y, La being indispensable; M is at least one element selected from the<br>
group consisting of Co, Mn, Ni and Zn; and x, y and n are numbers<br>
meeting the following conditions:<br>
0.01=x=0.4,<br>

CaO) being 0.2 weight % or less, and a total of an Al content (calculated as<br>

The method for producing a ferrite powder for bonded magnets<br>
according to the present invention comprises the steps of preparing a<br>
magnetically isotropic ferrite composition having the above basic<br>
composition; finely pulverizing the ferrite composition; and heat-treating<br>
the pulverized ferrite powder at 750-950°C for 0.5-3 hours in the air.<br>
It is preferred that the magnetically isotropic ferrite composition is<br>
prepared by mixing an iron oxide with a compound containing an A<br>
element, a compound containing an R element and a compound containing<br>
an M element and then calcining the resultant mixture for a solid-state<br>
reaction, and that the magnetically isotropic ferrite composition is<br>
subjected to dry-pulverization to an average diameter, heat treatment,<br>
immersion in water for disintegration, and then drying. Further, iron<br>
oxide obtained by spray-roasting a waste liquid generated by washing steel<br>
with hydrochloric acid is preferably used as the iron oxide.<br>
The total of a Si content (calculated as SiO2) and a Ca content<br>
(calculated as CaO) is preferably 0.15 weight % or less, and the total of an<br>

THE BEST MODE FOR CONDUCTING THE INVENTION<br>
[1] A ferrite powder<br>
The ferrite powder of the present invention substantially has a<br>
magnetoplumbite-type crystal structure having a basic composition<br>
represented by the following general formula:<br>
(A1-xRx)O-n[(Fe1-yMy)2O3] by atomic ratio,<br>
wherein A is Sr and/or Ba; R is at least one of rare earth elements including<br>
Y, La being indispensable; M is at least one element selected from the<br>
group consisting of Co, Mn, Ni and Zn; and x, y and n are numbers<br>
meeting the following conditions:<br>
0.01=x=0.4,<br>
[x/(2.6n)]=y=[x/(1.6n)], and<br>
5=n=6,<br>
and having an average diameter of 0.9-2 µm.<br>
To have good magnetic properties as the ferrite powder for bonded<br>
magnets, the value of n (molar ratio) should be between 5 and 6. When<br>
the value of n exceeds 6, undesirable phases such as a-Fe2O3 other than the<br>
magnetoplumbite phase are generated, resulting in drastic decrease in<br>
magnetic properties. On the other hand, when the value of n is less than 5,<br>
Br of the ferrite powder drastically decreases.<br>
The value of x is between 0.01 and 0.4. When the value of x<br>
exceeds 0.4, the magnetic properties of the ferrite powder rather decrease.<br>
On the other hand, when the value of x is less than 0.01, sufficient effects<br>
of the post-addition method or the prior/post-addition method cannot be<br><br>
obtained.<br>
R is at least one of rare earth elements including Y, La being<br>
indispensable. R-supplying starting materials may be composite rare<br>
earth oxides containing one or more of La, Nd, Pr and Ce. To increase as,<br>
the percentage of La in R is preferably 50 atomic % or more, more<br>
preferably 70 atomic % or more, particularly preferably 99 atomic % or<br>
more. R may be composed of La only.<br>
M may be any of Co, Mn, Ni and Zn, and Co is particularly<br>
preferable to obtain a high coercivity. Further, M may preferably be Co +<br>
Zn, and to achieve iHc =3.5 kOe, the percentage of Co in M is preferably<br>
50-90 atomic %, more preferably 70-90 atomic %. To achieve iHc =2.5<br>
kOe without neglecting Br, the percentage of Co in M is preferably 5<br>
atomic % or more and less than 50 atomic %, more preferably 5-30<br>
atomic %. When the percentage of Co in M is less than 5 atomic %,<br>
sufficient effects of improving iHc by Co cannot be obtained. On the<br>
other hand, when the percentage of Co in M exceeds 90 atomic %,<br>
sufficient effects of improving Br by Zn cannot be obtained.<br>
For the purpose of charge compensation, x and y should satisfy the<br>
relation of y = x/(2.0n). However, as long as y is from x/(2.6n) to x/(1.6n),<br>
the effects of the present invention by charge compensation are not<br>
substantially deteriorated. When the value of y deviates from x/(2.0n),<br>
there is likelihood that Fe2+ is contained without causing problems. On<br>
the other hand, when the ratio of x/ny exceeds 2.6 or is less than 1.6,<br>
remarkable decrease in magnetic properties is appreciated. Accordingly,<br>
the ratio of x/ny should be between 1.6 and 2.6. This condition may be<br>
converted to the formula of y as follows:<br>
[x/(2.6n)]=y=[x/(1.6n)].<br>
In typical example, the preferred range of y is 0.04 or less,<br>
particularly 0.005-0.03. Even when the contents of the R element and the<br>
M element meet the equation of y == x/(2.0n), part of the R element and/or<br>
the M element may be accumulated in high concentration in the vicinity of<br>
grain boundaries, without causing any problems.<br>
As impurities contained in the ferrite powder, a total of a Si content<br>
calculated as SiO2 and a Ca content calculated as CaO should be 0.2<br>
weight % or less, and a total of an Al content calculated as A12O3 and a Cr<br>
content calculated as Cr2O3 should be 0.13 weight % or less. When the<br>
total of the Si content and the Ca content exceeds 0.2 weight %, or when<br>
the total of the Al content and the Cr content exceeds 0.13 weight %, it is<br>
impossible to obtain bonded magnets having excellent magnetic properties.<br>
The preferred total of the Si content and the Ca content is 0.15 weight % or<br>
less, and the preferred total of the Al content and the Cr content is 0.1<br>
weight % or less. Because the purity of starting materials and quality of<br>
materials for a ball-milling apparatus are limited for practical reasons, it is<br>
actually difficult that the total of the Si content calculated as SiO2 and the<br>
Ca content calculated as CaO is 0.005 weight % or less, and the total of the<br>
Al content calculated as Al2O3 and the Cr content calculated as Cr2O3 is<br>
0.005 weight % or less.<br>
The ferrite powder for bonded magnets according to the present<br>
invention may be produced, for instance, by a solid-state reaction method,<br>
by the steps of mixing of starting material powders ? calcination for<br><br>
ferritization reaction (solid-state reaction) ? pulverization ? heat<br>
treatment.<br>
The purity of iron oxide used in the ferritization reaction (solid-state<br>
reaction) is important. The total of the Si content (calculated as SiO2) and<br>
the Ca content (calculated as CaO) is preferably 0.06 weight % or less,<br>
more preferably 0.05 weight % or less, particularly preferably 0.04<br>
weight % or less. Also, the total of the Al content (calculated as A12O3)<br>
and the Cr content (calculated as Cr2O3) is preferably 0.1 weight % or less,<br>
more preferably 0.09 weight % or less, particularly preferably 0.08<br>
weight % or less. Therefore, it is preferable to use recycled iron oxide<br>
obtained by spray-roasting a waste liquid generated by washing steel with<br>
hydrochloric acid. This recycled iron oxide is advantageous in low<br>
impurity content over iron oxide obtained by refining iron ore through the<br>
steps of iron ore ? fine pulverization ? classification ? magnetic<br>
separation, and iron oxide from iron sulfate obtained by treating mill scales<br>
or scraps.<br>
Preferable as materials for supplying the R elements are, for<br>
instance, one or more of oxides such as La2O3, hydroxides such as La(OH)3,<br>
carbonate hydrates such as La2(CO3)3-8H2O, organic acid salts such as<br>
La(CH3CO2)31.5H2O, La2(C2O4)310H2O, etc. Further, one or more of<br>
oxides, hydroxides, carbonates and organic acid salts of mixtures of rare<br>
earth elements (La, Nd, Pr and Ce) may also be used.<br>
Compounds of M elements are preferably, for instance, one or more<br>
of oxides such as CoO, Co3O4; hydroxides such as Co(OH)2, Co3O4-m1H2O,<br>
wherein m1 is a positive number; carbonates such as CoCO3; basic<br>
carbonates such as m2CoCO3.m3Co(OH)2-m4H20, wherein m2, m3 and m4<br>
are positive numbers. One or more oxides, hydroxides or carbonates of<br>
Mn or Ni may also be used. Further, one or more oxides, hydroxides or<br>
carbonates of Zn may be used.<br>
Starting material powders are preferably mixed in advance such that<br>
the target composition is achieved at a calcination step. When the R<br>
element and the M element are added at a mixing step, the powder mixture<br>
is subjected to two heating steps of calcination and heat treatment, resulting<br>
in more uniform ferrite composition due to well proceeded solid diffusion.<br>
Mixing, calcination and pulverization may be carried out<br>
substantially under the same conditions as in sintered ferrite magnets. For<br>
instance, after the wet mixing, a ferritization reaction is carried out by<br>
heating at 1150-1300°C for 1-5 hours in the air. A heating temperature<br>
lower than 1150°C fails to achieve sufficient ferritization, and a heating<br>
temperature exceeding 1300°C makes a calcined body extremely hard,<br>
resulting in drastically decreased pulverization efficiency. The<br>
pulverization step is preferably a combination of a coarse pulverization step<br>
using a crusher, and a fine pulverization step using a pulverizer. The fine<br>
pulverization is preferably carried out by using an attritor, a ball mill, a<br>
vibration ball mill, etc.<br>
To avoid the inclusion of Al, Si and Cr into ferrite powder in the<br>
pulverizer used in the present invention, a pulverization chamber<br>
(pulverization cylinder) of the pulverizer and a pulverization medium<br>
therein, which are in direct contact with powder being pulverized, are<br>
preferably made of chromium steel (Si: 0.15-0.35 weight %, Cr: 0.90-1.20<br><br>
weight %) such as SCr 415, 420, 430, 435, 440, 445 according to JIS G<br>
4104. High-carbon chromium bearing steel (Si: 0.15-0.70 weight %, Cr:<br>
0.90-1.60 weight %) such as SUJ 1, 2, 3 according to JIS G 4805 may also<br>
be used.<br>
The fine powder preferably has an average diameter of 0.8-1.9 µm,<br>
more preferably 0.9-1.4 µm, particularly preferably 0.95-1.2 µm. The<br>
average diameter of ferrite powder is measured by an air permeation<br>
method using a Fischer Subsieve sizer.<br>
The heat treatment is preferably carried out at 750-950°C for 0.5-3<br>
hours in the air. It is difficult to increase iHc under the conditions of<br>
lower than 750°C x 0.5 hours, and the conditions exceeding 950°C x 3<br>
hours provides extreme agglomeration of ferrite powder, resulting in<br>
drastic decrease in Br. The preferred heat treatment temperature is 750-<br>
900°C. To prevent the agglomeration of ferrite powder by the heat<br>
treatment, it is preferable to use a tumbling-type or fluidized bed-type heat<br>
treatment apparatus.<br>
The heat treatment increases the average diameter of the fine ferrite<br>
powder by about 0.05-0.1 µm. Accordingly, the heat-treated ferrite<br>
powder has an average diameter of preferably 0.9-2 µm, more preferably<br>
1.0-1.5 µm, and particularly preferably 1.05-1.3 µm. When the average<br>
diameter is less than 0.9 µm, the filling rate of magnetic powder in a blend<br>
for a bonded magnet is low, resulting in drastic decrease in a density, Br<br>
and (BH)max of the resultant bonded magnet. On the other hand, when the<br>
average diameter exceeds 2 µm, it is difficult to achieve iHc =3.5 kOe even<br>
when R = La, and M = Co.<br><br>
In the production of the ferrite powder of the present invention, the<br>
fine ferrite powder adjusted to have an average diameter of 0.85-1.95 µm<br>
may be mixed with a Bi compound in an amount of 0.2-0.6 weight %<br>
calculated as Bi2O3, and then subjected to a heat treatment at 825-950°C for<br>
0.5-3 hours to remove strain, thereby imparting high magnetization and<br>
coercivity. The heat treatment conditions of lower than 825°C x 0.5 hours<br>
fails to provide sufficient agglomeration suppressing effects by the melting<br>
of Bi2O3 to a liquid phase, and also fails to achieve sufficient iHc. On the<br>
other hand, when the heat treatment conditions exceed 950° C x 3 hours,<br>
iHc increases while Br relatively decreases. By a heat treatment after the<br>
addition of the Bi compound in an amount of 0.2-0.6 weight % calculated<br>
as Bi2O3, a tendency is appreciated that the ferrite powder becomes thicker<br>
in a C-axis direction than in the case of no addition, resulting in more<br>
rounded particle shape. The round shape of the ferrite powder is preferable<br>
because of improved dispersibility, filling ratio and magnetic orientation in<br>
a binder. The addition of less than 0.2 weight % of the Bi compound fails<br>
to provide sufficient effects, while effects are saturated over 0.6 weight %<br>
of the Bi compound.<br>
[2] Anisotropic granulated powder<br>
In the production of a long, cylindrical ferrite bonded magnet<br>
having a polar or radially anisotropic to obtain magnet rolls for copiers and<br>
printers, well-moldable compounds are desired because of the long shape<br>
of the bonded magnet. Accordingly, it is preferable to properly increase<br>
the average diameter of ferrite powder blended in compounds. As<br>
described above, however, the ferrite powder having an average diameter<br>
exceeding 2 µm provides iHc of less than 3.5 kOe even when R = La, and<br>
M = Co, resulting in drastic decrease in Br. As a result of intense research,<br>
it has been found that the above problems can be solved by making an<br>
anisotropic granulated powder by agglomerating a plurality of ferrite<br>
powder of the present invention in the same magnetization direction.<br>
The anisotropic granulated powder can be produced by the steps of<br>
mixing of starting material powders ? ferritization reaction (solid-state<br>
reaction) ? calcination ? pulverization ? molding in magnetic field ?<br>
disintegration ? heat treatment ? disintegration in water. The iron oxide<br>
used in this case may have the same purity as in the above ferrite powder.<br>
The calcined ferrite powder is finely pulverized to an average<br>
diameter of preferably 0.9-1.4 µm, more preferably 0.95-1.35 µm,<br>
particularly preferably 1.0-1.3 µm. When the fine powder has an average<br>
diameter of less than 0.9 µm, the anisotropic granulated powder has<br>
drastically decreased Br. On the other hand, when the average diameter of<br>
the fine powder exceeds 1.3 µm, Br and iHc decrease. The pulverized<br>
ferrite powder is then subjected to wet- or dry-molding in a magnetic field.<br>
In either wet or dry, the molding is preferably carried out at room<br>
temperature under pressure of about 0.35-0.45 ton/cm2 while applying a<br>
magnetic field of 8-15 kOe. The resultant anisotropic granulated powder<br>
has a density of about 2.6-3.2 g/cm3. The resultant green body is then<br>
disintegrated by a jaw crusher, etc. and classified by a sieve or wind to<br>
adjust the final average diameter to more than 2 µm and 10 µm or less.<br>
The anisotropic granulated powder thus produced is heat-treated<br>
under the same conditions as in the above ferrite powder. To break the<br><br>
agglomeration of the heat-treated powder, the heat-treated powder is<br>
preferably immersed in a liquid such as water, and stirred, if necessary.<br>
The resultant anisotropic granulated powder has such magnetic anisotropy<br>
that an easy-magnetization axis aligned substantially in the same direction.<br>
The average diameter of the anisotropic granulated powder is<br>
preferably more than 2 µm and 10 µm or less, more preferably 2.5-5 µm,<br>
particularly preferably 3-4 µm. The average diameter of 2 µm or less<br>
would not be advantageous over the above ferrite powder. On the other<br>
hand, the average diameter exceeding 10 µm would provide drastic<br>
decrease in Br. Incidentally, the average diameter of the anisotropic<br>
granulated powder is measured by a Heros Rodos particle size distribution<br>
measuring apparatus available from JEOL LTD.<br>
Because the anisotropic granulated powder has higher iHc, not less<br>
than Br and an larger average diameter than those of the conventional Sr<br>
and/or Ba ferrite powder, the moldability of compounds are improved by<br>
using the anisotropic granulated powder. Thus, in the case of a long,<br>
cylindrical ferrite bonded magnet, the unevenness of a surface magnetic<br>
flux density in a longitudinal direction is smaller when the anisotropic<br>
granulated powder is used than when the ferrite powder that is not<br>
subjected to anisotropic granulation is used. Therefore, the long,<br>
cylindrical bonded magnet formed from the anisotropic granulated powder<br>
is suitable for magnet rolls of copiers or printers for producing copies or<br>
prints free from unevenness. It is also useful for rotors.<br>
[3] Bonded magnet<br>
The bonded magnet is produced from the ferrite powder or the<br>
anisotropic granulated powder thereof by the steps of surface treatment ?<br>
blending with binder ? molding. The strength and/or Br of the bonded<br>
magnet can be improved by carrying out a surface treatment comprising<br>
adding 0.1-1 weight % of a surface-treating agent such as a silane coupling<br>
agent, a titanate coupling agent, etc. to the ferrite powder or its anisotropic<br>
granulated powder before blending, and if necessary, heating at 70-150°C<br>
for 0.5-3 hours in the air.<br>
85-95 parts by weight of the ferrite powder or its anisotropic<br>
granulated powder is preferably blended with 15-5 parts by weight of a<br>
binder. Thermoplastic resins, thermosetting resins or rubbers may usually<br>
be used as the binder. When the thermosetting resins are used, a heat-<br>
setting treatment should be carried out after molding. In addition, low-<br>
melting point metals or alloys having melting points lower than the Curie<br>
temperature of the ferrite powder may be used. When the amount of the<br>
ferrite powder added is less than 85 weight %, it is difficult to obtain high<br>
Br. On the other hand, when it exceeds 95 weight %, the filling of the<br>
ferrite powder in the bonded magnet becomes difficult, resulting in large<br>
numbers of small pores contained in the resultant green body, which leads<br>
to decrease in the density, Br and (BH)max of the bonded magnet. In<br>
addition to the above indispensable components, the compounds may<br>
preferably contain magnetic powder-dispersing agents such as phenols,<br>
lubricants such as waxes, plasticizers such as DOP, DBP, etc. alone or in<br>
combination. The total amount of these additives is preferably 3<br>
weight % or less, more preferably 1-2 weight %.<br>
The molded article is anisotropic or isotropic depending on the<br>
presence or absence of an orientation magnetic field and/or mechanical<br>
stress. Molding may be carried out by an injection molding method, an<br>
compression molding method, or an extrusion molding method.<br>
[4] Magnet roll<br>
The preferred embodiment of the above bonded magnet is a magnet<br>
roll, and a bonded magnet for a magnet roll is provided with radial or polar<br>
anisotropy. The bonded magnet for a magnet roll should not necessarily<br>
be integral, and what is necessary is that at least one magnetic pole portion<br>
is constituted by the anisotropic bonded magnet of the present invention.<br>
Figs. 5 and 6 show the structure of an apparatus for producing an<br>
integral, cylindrical bonded magnet having radial anisotropy for a magnet<br>
roll. Fig. 5 is a cross-sectional view showing the entire structure of the<br>
molding apparatus, and Fig. 6 is a cross-sectional view showing the<br>
detailed structure of an essential part (die for orientation) of the molding<br>
apparatus in Fig. 5. In Fig. 5, a double-screw extruder 6 constituting the<br>
molding apparatus comprises a barrel 62 consisting of a plurality of parts<br>
and equipped with a hopper 61 at one end, two screws 63 (only one is<br>
shown in the figure) disposed in the barrel 62, and an adapter 64 mounted<br>
to a tip end of the barrel 62. An orientation die 7 is mounted to the<br>
adapter 64 at its exit. This die 7 comprises a ring-shaped spacer 71, a<br>
ring-shaped mandrel 72, a cylindrical molding space 73 existing between<br>
them, and magnetic field-generating means 74 disposed around the ring-<br>
shaped spacer 71.<br>
The magnetic field-generating means 74 comprises a cylindrical<br>
yoke 75 made of ferrimagnet composed of a first yoke 75a and a second<br><br>
yoke 75b, and a plurality of coils 76 disposed at predetermined intervals<br>
inside the cylindrical yoke 75 such that it encircles the molding space 73.<br>
Magnetic flux F flows in the yoke 75 as shown in the figure.<br>
Using the molding apparatus 6, a radially anisotropic bonded<br>
magnet can be produced in a manner as described below. A starting<br>
material introduced into the barrel 62 through the hopper 61 is subjected to<br>
shear stress by the rotation of a pair of screws 63, and conveyed to the<br>
orientation die 7 while being molten by heating at a temperature of 150-<br>
230°C. The molten material passes through a molding space reduced to a<br>
predetermined cross section in the orientation die 7 while being applied a<br>
magnetic field. Specifically, the intensity of a magnetic field may be 3-6<br>
kOe. When molded in a radially or polar anisotropic magnetic field<br>
having such a level of intensity, radially or polar anisotropic bonded<br>
magnets having practically satisfactory magnetic properties can be obtained.<br>
When the magnetic field intensity is too low, sufficient orientation cannot<br>
be obtained.<br>
After extruded from the die, the radially anisotropic molded article<br>
11 is cut to a proper length (L/D=5), cooled for solidification and then<br>
demagnetized. This molded article is fixed to a shaft 12 to provide a<br>
magnet roll as shown in Fig. 7. In Fig. 7, 2 denotes a sleeve, 3a and 3b<br>
denote supports for the sleeve 2, 4 denotes a bearing, and 5 denotes a seal.<br>
Though an example shown in Figs. 5-7 is related to an integral,<br>
cylindrical bonded magnet, the present invention is not restricted to such a<br>
bonded magnet. What is necessary is that at least one magnetic pole<br>
portion is formed by the anisotropic bonded magnet of the present<br><br>
invention. For instance, a radially or polar anisotropic bonded magnet<br>
formed in an arc segment shape may be bonded together to a cylindrical<br>
shape. Further, a cylindrical permanent magnet (for instance, isotropic<br>
ferrite magnet or ferrite bonded magnet having a conventional<br>
composition) for a magnet roll may be provided with a longitudinal groove<br>
on a surface thereof, and the anisotropic bonded magnet of the present<br>
invention in a shape of a long block (for instance, having U-cross section)<br>
may be fixed into the groove to provide a magnetic pole.<br>
When the bonded magnet is provided with a radial anisotropy, the<br>
magnet roll 1 of the present invention has not only improved Br but also a<br>
plurality of magnetic poles on a surface. Therefore, any desired<br>
arrangement of magnetic poles can be selected in the magnet roll of the<br>
present invention.<br>
The present invention will be described in detail referring to<br>
EXAMPLES below, without intention of restricting the scope of the present<br>
invention thereto.<br>
EXAMPLE 1, COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 1<br>
Used as high-purity iron oxide (a-Fe2O3) was recycled iron oxide<br>
obtained by spray-roasting a waste liquid generated by washing steel with<br>
hydrochloric acid, whose composition is shown in Table 1.<br>
The high-purity iron oxide, SrCO3 having a purity of 99% or more,<br>
oxides of R elements and oxides of M elements were formulated to provide<br>
the following basic composition:<br>
(Sr1-xRx)O-n[(Fel-yMy)2O3] by atomic ratio,<br>
wherein x = 0.15, and y = x/2n = 0.0125, n = 6.0, wet-mixed, and then<br>
calcined at 1200°C for 2 hours in the air. La was selected as the R<br>
element under the criterion that La has an ion radius close to a radius of a<br>
Sr ion. Also, Ti, V, Mn, Co, Ni, Cu and Zn were selected as the M<br>
elements under the criterion that they had ion radii close to a radius of an<br>
Fe ion. As a conventional material, ferrite having the above basic<br>
composition in which x = y = 0 and n = 6.0, namely SrO-6Fe2O3, was<br>
calcined under the same conditions.<br>
Each calcined powder was coarsely pulverized in a dry state by a<br>
roller mill, and each of the resultant coarse powder (average diameter: 5-10<br>
µm, measured by a Heros Rodos particle size distribution measuring<br>
apparatus) was measured with respect to magnetic properties by a<br>
vibration-type magnetometer. The highest intensity of a magnetic field in<br>
which measurement was carried out was 12 kOe, and a saturation<br>
magnetization as and Hc were determined by s-1/H2 plot, wherein a is<br>
magnetization and H is the intensity of a magnetic field applied. The<br>
resultant phases of the coarse powder were identified by X-ray diffraction,<br>
and the results are shown in Table 2.<br>
It is appreciated from Table 2 that when Cu was not contained as<br>
the M element, only X-ray diffraction peaks for a magnetoplumbite phase<br>
(M phase) were observed in any powder. Table 2 also indicates that when<br>
La was selected as the R element, and Mn, Mn + Co, Ni, Ni + Co, or Zn +<br><br>
Co was selected as the M element, the resultant calcined powder had higher<br>
as (or higher as and Hc) than the conventional coarse powder of<br>
SrO-6Fe203, suggesting that such calcined powder can be formed into high-<br>
performance bonded magnets. An isotropic bonded magnet can be<br>
produced from each coarse powder of EXAMPLE 1 in Table 2, by heat<br>
treatment, if necessary, under the above-described conditions, mixing with<br>
a binder at a proper ratio, blending to form a compound, and then injection<br>
molding, compression molding or extrusion molding without a magnetic<br>
field.<br>
Further, it has been found from investigation in connection with the<br>
above experiments that a combination of R = La + Pr, La + Nd, La + Ce,<br>
La + Nd + Pr, La + Pr + Ce or La + Nd + Pr + Ce may be used, and that the<br>
percentage of La in the R element is required to be 50 atomic % or more to<br>
obtain higher as than that of the conventional coarse powder of<br>
SrO-6Fe2O3.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
Sr, La and Co were selected as the A element, the R element and the<br>
M element, respectively, and SrCO3, iron oxide, La2O3 and CoO each<br>
having substantially the same purity as in EXAMPLE 1 were formulated to<br>
provide the following basic composition:<br>
(Sr1-xLax)O-n[(Fe1-yCOy)2O3] by atomic ratio,<br>
wherein x = 0-0.6, y = x/2n = 0-0.05, and n = 6.0, wet-mixed, and then<br>
calcined at 1200°C for 2 hours in the air. The calcined powder was<br>
coarsely pulverized in the same manner as in EXAMPLE 1 and then<br><br>
measured with respect to magnetic properties. The results are shown in<br>
Fig. 1.<br>
It is clear from Fig. 1 that when both La2O3 and CoO are added, a<br>
higher coercivity He is obtained at x = 0.01-0.4 than at x = 0, and a higher<br>
saturation magnetization as is obtained at x = 0.01-0.4 than at x = 0.<br>
Accordingly, the range of x is 0.01=x=0.4, preferably 0.05=x=0.4, more<br>
preferably 0.07=x=0.4, to achieve high potential of as and Hc.<br>
Further, in the coarse ferrite powder produced from starting<br>
materials having the same purity as in EXAMPLE 1, substantially the same<br>
tendency as shown in Fig. 1 is appreciated in the case of the basic<br>
composition of (Sr1-xLax)O-n[(Fe1-yCoy)2O3] by atomic ratio, and (a) when<br>
the R element is 50 atomic % La + 50 atomic % Pr, 50 atomic % La + 50<br>
atomic % Nd, or 50 atomic % La + 50 atomic % Ce, and the M element is<br>
Co, or (b) when the R element is La, and the M element is 50 atomic % Co<br>
+ 50 atomic % Zn, 50 atomic % Co + 50 atomic % Mn, or 50 atomic % Co<br>
+ 50 atomic % Ni.<br>
The ferrite powder of the present invention shows substantially the<br>
same tendency as shown in Fig. 1, when the value of n is 5.0-6.0.<br>
Therefore, it is possible to achieve improvement in as and Hc by the<br>
addition of the R element and the M element at the value n of 5.0-6.0.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
In this EXAMPLE, the permissible ratio of the R element to the M<br>
element in connection with charge compensation was determined. Sr, La<br>
and Co were selected as the A element, the R element and the M element,<br><br>
respectively, and SrCO3, iron oxide, La2O3 and CoO each having<br>
substantially the same purity as in EXAMPLE 1 were formulated to provide<br>
the following basic composition:<br>
(Sr1-xLax)O-n[(Fe1-yCoy)2O3] by atomic ratio,<br>
whereat x = 0.15, y = 0.77-1.43 x 10"2, and n = 6.0, wet-mixed, and then<br>
calcined at 1200°C for 2 hours in the air. The calcined powder was<br>
coarsely pulverized in the same manner as in EXAMPLE 1 and then<br>
measured with respect to magnetic properties.<br>
It has thus been found that a high-performance bonded magnet<br>
having higher Br (or higher Br and iHc) than those of the conventional Sr<br>
and/or Ba ferrite bonded magnets can be obtained, as long as the ratio of<br>
x/ny is within the range of 1.6-2.6, not limited to the conditions under<br>
which the charge balance is fully kept, namely to a ratio of x to y satisfying<br>
the relation of y = x/2n. On the other hand, when the ratio of x/ny<br>
exceeds 2.6 or is less than 1.6, deterioration in magnetic properties due to<br>
the failure of the charge balance is appreciated. Accordingly, the ratio of<br>
x/ny should be between 1.6 and 2.6. This condition may be converted to<br>
the formula of y as follows:<br>
[x/(2.6n)]=y=[x/(1.6n)].<br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
La and Co were selected as the R element and the M element,<br>
respectively, and SrCO3, iron oxide, La2O3 and Co3 oxides each having<br>
substantially the same purity as in EXAMPLE 1 were formulated to provide<br>
the following basic composition:<br>
(Sr1-xLax)O-n[(Fe1-yCoy)2O3] by atomic ratio,<br>
whereat x = 0.15, y = x/2n, and n = 5.85, wet-mixed, and then calcined at<br>
1200°C for 2 hours in the air. The calcined powder was coarsely<br>
pulverized in a dry state by a roller mill.<br>
700 g of the resultant coarse powder was charged into a ball mill<br>
pot [volume: 10 liters, made of SUJ3 (C: 0.95-1.10 weight %, Si: 0.40-0.70<br>
weight %, Mn: 0.90-1.15 weight %, Cr: 0.90-1.20 weight %, P: 0.025<br>
weight % or less, S: 0.025 weight % or less)], together with 10 kg of steel<br>
balls (each diameter: 6 mm, made of SUJ3) as pulverization media and<br>
ethyl alcohol ( pulverization aid added in a small amount to suppress<br>
agglomeration of pulverized powder), and the pot was sealed. The<br>
amount of ethyl alcohol added at an initial stage was 50 cm3, and 10 cm3 of<br>
ethyl alcohol was added every time the average diameter of the coarse<br>
powder was measured. Dry fine pulverization may be carried out by ball<br>
milling at a peripheral speed of 0.7 m/sec.<br>
With varied pulverization time, fine ferrite powder having an<br>
average diameter of 0.7-1.95 µm was obtained. Each of the resultant fine<br>
powder was introduced into a heat-resistant container, which was set in an<br>
electric furnace heated in the same atmosphere as the air. After annealing<br>
heat treatment at 830 ± 2°C for 3 hours to remove strain, the fine powder<br>
was cooled to room temperature. After the heat-treated fine powder was<br>
charged into water to disintegrate the agglomeration of fine particles due to<br>
the heat treatment, it was heated at 100°C to remove moisture and then<br>
cooled to room temperature. To disintegrate the dried powder, the fine<br>
powder was caused to pass through a 150-mesh sieve to obtain ferrite<br>
powder having an average diameter of 0.8-2.0 µm. The average diameter<br>
of ferrite powder was measured by an air permeation method using a<br>
Fischer Subsieve sizer.<br>
The above ferrite powder was separated to provide a fraction having<br>
an average diameter of 0.8-1.6 µm, which was sealed in a holder of VSM<br>
to measure a maximum magnetization (s4kOe) while applying a parallel<br>
magnetic field of 4 kOe at 20° C. The correlation of average diameter and<br>
s4koe in each powder is shown by O in Fig. 2.<br>
Also measured with respect to the ferrite powder obtained by the<br>
same method were an average diameter, increase of the Si content (?SiO2,<br>
calculated as SiO2) and the Cr content (?Cr2O3, calculated as Cr2O3), the<br>
amount calculated as (SiO2 + CaO) and the amount calculated as (Al2O3 +<br>
Cr2O3) from "before calcination" to "after pulverization." The results are<br>
shown in Table 3. It is clear from Table 3 that in any ferrite powder for<br>
bonded magnets having each average diameter, ?SiO2 was 0.018-0.142<br>
weight %, and ?Cr2O3 was 0.002-0.009 weight %. For instance, in the<br>
case of Sample No. 32, ?SiO2 was 0.108 weight %, and ?Cr2O3 was 0.008<br>
weight % by the fine pulverization. In the case of Sample Nos. 31-33,<br>
85% or more of ?SiO2 was attributed to inclusion at the fine pulverization<br>
step. Other portions of ?SiO2 were attributed to inclusion at the coarse<br>
pulverization step, the water immersion step after the heat treatment, and<br>
the classification step by a sieve. 80% or more of ?Cr2O3 in Sample Nos.<br>
31-36 was attributed to inclusion at the fine pulverization step.<br>
COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 2<br>
For comparison, calcination, coarse pulverization, fine pulverization,<br>
heat treatment, immersion in water, drying and 150-mesh sieving were<br>
carried out to produce ferrite powder having an average diameter of 0.8-2.0<br>
µm, in the same manner as in EXAMPLE 4 except for using SrCO3 and iron<br>
oxide each having the same purity as in EXAMPLE 1 for a basic<br>
composition of Sr05.85Fe2O3, and making the finely pulverized ferrite<br>
powder have an average diameter of 0.75-1.93 µm. A ferrite powder<br>
fraction having an average diameter of 0.82-1.60 µm, which was separated<br>
from the resultant ferrite powder, was sealed in a holder of VSM to<br>
measure a maximum magnetization (s4kOe) while applying a parallel<br>
magnetic field of 4 kOe at 20°C. The correlation of average diameter and<br>
s4kOe in each powder is shown by ? in Fig. 2.<br>
Also measured with respect to the ferrite powder obtained by the<br>
same method were an average diameter, ?SiO2, ?Cr2O3, (SiO2 + CaO) and<br>
(A12O3 + Cr2O3). The results are shown in Table 3. The comparison of<br>
ferrite powder having substantially the same average diameter in Table 3<br>
clearly shows that ?SiO2, ?Cr2O3, (SiO2 + CaO) and (Al2O3 + Cr2O3) of the<br>
ferrite powder having this conventional composition are not different from<br>
those of EXAMPLE 4 (indicated by O).<br>
As is clear from Fig. 2, however, the ferrite powder of EXAMPLE 4<br>
(indicated by O) shows higher s4kOe by about 1-2 emu/g than that of<br>
COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 2 (indicated by ?) in an average diameter<br>
range of 0.8 to 1.6 µm. This verifies that even ferrite powder containing<br>
impurities on the same level fails to show high s4kOe unless the requirement<br><br>
of a basic composition is not met.<br>
90 parts by weight of ferrite powder in EXAMPLE 4 or<br>
COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 2, 7.7 parts by weight of an ethylene-ethyl<br>
acrylate copolymer (EEA, Mw = 43,000, EA content = 41 weight %, MB-<br>
870, available from Nippon Unicar K. K.), 1.0 parts by weight of a<br>
dispersant (DH-37, available from Adeka Argus Chemical Co., Ltd.), and<br>
0.5 parts by weight of a lubricant (Slipacks E, available from Nippon Kasei<br>
K. K.) were mixed in a mixer, and the resultant mixture was blended while<br>
heating at 150°C. After cooled for solidification, the blend was crushed to<br>
particles of 5 mm or less in diameter. After adding 0.8 parts by weight of<br>
a silicone oil (KF968, viscosity = 100 centistokes at 25°C, surface tension<br>
= 20.8 dyne/cm at 25°C, available from Shin-etsu Chemical Co., Ltd.), the<br>
blend was granulated at 150°C to provide compounds. The blending and<br>
granulation were carried out by a double-screw extruder.<br>
Each of the resultant compounds was charged into an injection<br>
molding apparatus and injection-molded into a cavity of a die having a<br>
magnetic circuit attached to the injection molding apparatus, under the<br>
conditions of an injection temperature of 200°C, an injection pressure of<br>
1000 kgf/cm2 and an orientation magnetic field intensity of 4.0 ±0.2 kOe,<br>
to form an anisotropic bonded magnet of 20 mm in length x 20 mm in<br>
width x 10 mm in thickness. Each of the resultant anisotropic bonded<br>
magnets was measured with respect to magnetic properties by a B-H tracer<br>
at 20°C. The results are shown in Table 3. Table 3 clearly shows the<br>
advantages of the bonded magnet formed from the ferrite powder of<br>
EXAMPLE 4.<br>
Anisotropic bonded magnets were produced by an injection<br>
molding method for the measurement of magnetic properties in the same<br>
manner as above except for using two types of compounds obtained from<br>
the ferrite powder having an average diameter of 1.05 µm in EXAMPLE 4<br>
and COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 2 at an orientation magnetic field intensity<br>
of 10±0.2 kOe. As a result, the bonded magnet formed from the ferrite<br>
powder having an average diameter of 1.05 µm in EXAMPLE 4 had Br of<br>
2,780 G and iHc of 4,470 Oe, and the bonded magnet formed from the<br>
ferrite powder having an average diameter of 1.05 µm in COMPARATIVE<br>
EXAMPLE 2 had Br of 2,720 G and iHc of 2,900 Oe. This result indicates<br>
the advantages of the ferrite powder of the present invention even at a<br>
magnetic field intensity of 10 kOe.<br>
In the production of a radially or polar anisotropic ferrite bonded<br>
magnet (for instance, solid cylindrical or ring-shaped bonded magnet<br>
capable of being magnetized to have 4-24 symmetrical or unsymmetrical<br>
magnetic poles), it is difficult to apply as strong a magnetic field as 10 kOe<br>
or more. Therefore, it is preferable to use the ferrite powder capable of<br>
being well oriented by a magnetic field suitable for mass production of<br>
preferably 8 kOe or less, more preferably 6 kOe or less, particularly<br>
preferably 3-6 kOe.<br>
EXAMPLE 5<br>
EXAMPLE 4 was repeated up to fine pulverization by a dry ball mill<br>
except for using iron oxide, SrCO3, Fe2O3, La2O3 and ZnO each having<br>
substantially the same purity as in EXAMPLE 1 to provide a basic<br>
composition of (Sr0.883La0.117)O-5.75[(Fe0.99Co0.005Zn0.005)2O3] by atomic ratio,<br>
to provide five types of fine ferrite powder having different average<br>
diameters. After adding 0.4 parts by weight of bismuth oxide (Bi2O3) to<br>
100 parts by weight of each fine ferrite powder, mixing was carried out to<br>
provide five types of mixed powder. Each mixed powder was subjected to<br>
heat treatment, immersion in water, drying and 150-mesh sieving in the<br>
same manner as in EXAMPLE 4, to produce five types of ferrite magnet<br>
powder having different average diameters. As shown in Table 4, each<br>
ferrite magnet powder was substantially on the same level as those having<br>
substantially the same average diameters in Table 3 in any of ASiO2,<br>
ACr2O3, (SiO2 + CaO), and (Al2O3 + Cr2O3).<br>
COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 3<br>
For comparison, five types of ferrite powder having different<br>
average diameters for bonded magnets were produced in the same manner<br>
as in EXAMPLE 5 except for using a basic composition of SrO.5.75Fe2O3.<br>
Each ferrite magnet powder was substantially on the same level as those<br>
having substantially the same average diameters in Table 3 in any of ASiO2,<br>
ACr2O3, (SiO2 + CaO), and (Al2O3 + Cr2O3).<br>
After weighing each ferrite powder of EXAMPLE 5 and<br>
COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 3 shown in Table 4, each powder was charged<br>
into a Henschel mixer, in which a surface treatment comprising mixing 100<br>
parts by weight of each ferrite powder with 0.25 parts by weight of<br>
aminosilane (KBM-603, available from Shin-etsu Chemical Co., Ltd.),<br>
heating the resultant mixture at 80°C for 3 hours in the air, and then cooling<br>
it to room temperature was carried out. 90 parts by weight of each<br>
surface-treated ferrite powder was melt-blended with 9.6 parts by weight of<br>
12-nylon (P-3014U, available from Ube Industries, Ltd.) and 0.4 parts by<br>
weight of stearic acid amide (AP-1, available from Nippon Kasei K. K.) at<br>
an initial temperature of 230° C by a high-temperature, high-pressure type<br>
kneader, and pelletized to produce pellet-shaped compounds.<br>
Each of compounds in EXAMPLE 5 and COMPARATIVE<br>
EXAMPLE 3 was charged into an injection molding apparatus and<br>
injection-molded into a cavity of a die having a magnetic circuit attached to<br>
the injection molding apparatus, under the conditions of an injection<br>
temperature of 280°C, an injection pressure of 1000 kgf/cm2 and an<br>
orientation magnetic field intensity of 4.0 ±0.2 kOe, to form an anisotropic<br>
bonded magnet of 20 mm in length x 20 mm in width x 10 mm in thickness.<br>
Each bonded magnet was measured with respect to Br and iHc by a B-H<br>
tracer at 20°C, and with respect to s4kOe by VSM at 20°C. The results are<br>
shown in Table 4 together with the average diameter of ferrite powder<br>
added to each bonded magnet.<br>
As shown in Table 4, when measured on bonded magnets<br>
containing ferrite powder having substantially the same average diameter,<br>
it has been found that the anisotropic bonded magnet containing each<br>
ferrite powder in EXAMPLE 5 had higher than the anisotropic bonded<br>
magnet containing each ferrite powder in COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 3 by<br>
70-130 G in Br and by 280-500 Oe in iHc. It has also been found from<br>
investigation in connection with Table 4 that when the percentage of Co in<br>
M is 50-90 atomic %, and when the average diameter is 1.0-1.5 µm, the<br>
resultant bonded magnet has Br=2.6 kG and iHc=2.7 kOe, usable in high-<br>
temperature applications. It has also been found that particularly when<br>
the percentage of Co in M is 50-90 atomic %, and when the average<br><br>
diameter is 1.0-1.3 µm, it is possible to achieve Br=2.65 kG and iHo=3 kOe.<br>
It has also been found that when the percentage of Co in M is 5 atomic %<br>
or more and less than 50 atomic %, and when the average diameter is 1.0-<br>
1.5 µm, the bonded magnet has Br=2.65 kG and iHc=2.5 kOe, usable in<br>
high-temperature applications. It has further been found that when the<br>
percentage of Co in M is 5-30 atomic %, and when the average diameter is<br>
1.0-1.3 µm, the bonded magnet has Brs2.7 kG and iHc=2.5 kOe.<br>
Next, a predetermined amount of ferrite powder in Sample Nos. 52<br>
and 62 in Table 4 was sealed in a holder of VSM. The maximum<br>
magnetization (s10kOe) was 71.0 emu/g (Sample No. 52) and 69.6 emu/g<br>
(Sample No. 62), when a magnetic field of 10 kOe was applied at 20°C.<br>
Further, anisotropic bonded magnets were produced by an injection<br>
molding method for the measurement of magnetic properties in the same<br>
manner as above except for using two types of compounds obtained from<br>
the ferrite powder of Sample Nos. 52 and 62 in Table 4 at an orientation<br>
magnetic field intensity of 10±0.2 kOe. As a result, the bonded magnet<br>
formed from the ferrite powder of Sample No. 52 had Br of 2,830 G and<br>
iHc of 3,440 Oe, and the bonded magnet formed from the ferrite powder of<br>
Sample No. 62 had Br of 2,740 G and iHc of 2,900 Oe. This result<br>
indicates the advantages of the ferrite powder of the present invention even<br>
at a magnetic field intensity of 10 kOe.<br>
EXAMPLE 6<br>
Compounds were produced under the same conditions as in<br>
EXAMPLE 5 except for using the ferrite powder of Sample No. 33<br>
(EXAMPLE 4) in Table 3. Also, compounds of Sample No. 53<br>
(EXAMPLE 5) and Sample No. 63 (COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 3) in Table<br>
4 were prepared.<br>
Each of the above three types of compounds was charged into an<br>
injection molding apparatus and injection-molded into a cavity of a die<br>
having a magnetic circuit attached to the injection molding apparatus,<br>
under the conditions of an injection temperature of 280°C, an injection<br>
pressure of 1000 kgf/cm2 and an orientation magnetic field intensity of 4.1-<br>
4.2 kOe, to form a radially anisotropic bonded magnet of 13.6 mm in outer<br>
diameter x 5 mm in inner diameter x 10 mm in width for rotors.<br>
Each of the resultant three types of bonded magnets for rotors was<br>
symmetrically provided with 10 magnetic poles under the conditions of<br>
saturating magnetic properties, and then measured with respect to a surface<br>
magnetic flux density at 20°C. The resultant surface magnetic flux<br>
density distribution was used to determine the maximum surface magnetic<br>
flux density of each magnetic pole, which was then averaged. The<br>
averaged values are shown in Table 5.<br>
EXAMPLE 7<br>
High-purity recycled iron oxide shown in Table 1 was mixed with<br>
predetermined amounts of SiO2, CaO, Al2O3 and Cr2O3 to produce ferrite<br>
powder, whose magnetic properties were evaluated.<br>
Ferrite powder having an average diameter of 1.05 µm was<br>
produced in the same manner as in EXAMPLE 4 except for changing the<br>
materials of a ball mill pot and steel balls to SUJ1 (C: 0.95-1.10 weight %,<br>
Si: 0.15-0.35 weight %, Mn: 0.50 weight % or less, Cr: 0.90-1.20 weight %,<br>
P: 0.025 weight % or less, S: 0.025 weight % or less), setting a peripheral<br>
speed at 0.5 m/second, and carrying out immersion in water, drying and<br>
sieving in a clean room after a heat treatment. A bonded magnets was<br>
produced in the same manner as in EXAMPLE 4 to measure magnetic<br>
properties thereof. The results are shown as Sample No. 71 in Table 6.<br>
In this ferrite powder for bonded magnets, ?SiO2 = 0.062 weight %, and<br>
?Cr2O3 = 0.006 weight %.<br>
Trace amounts of SiO2 and Cr2O3 were added at the time of fine<br>
pulverization of Sample No. 71 by dry ball milling, to produce ferrite<br>
powder having an average diameter of 1.05-1.06 µm, with the amount<br>
calculated as (SiO2 + CaO) and the amount calculated as (Al2O3 + Cr2O3)<br>
finally adjusted as shown in Table 6. Bonded magnets obtained by using<br>
each ferrite powder were measured with respect to magnetic properties in<br>
the same manner as above. The results are shown as Sample Nos. 72-75<br>
in Table 6.<br><br>
COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 4<br>
Trace amounts of SiO2 and Cr2O3 were added at the time of fine<br>
pulverization of Sample No. 71 by dry ball milling, to produce ferrite<br>
powder having an average diameter of 1.06 µm, with the amount calculated<br>
as (SiO2 + CaO) and the amount calculated as (Al2O3 + Cr2O3) finally<br>
adjusted as shown in Table 6. Bonded magnets were produced by using<br>
the above ferrite powder in the same manner as in EXAMPLE 7 to measure<br>
magnetic properties thereof. The results are shown as Sample Nos. 81<br>
and 82 in Table 6.<br>
Table 6 showed that when the value of (SiO2 + CaO) was 0.2<br>
weight % or less, and when the value of (Al2O3 + Cr2O3) was 0.13<br>
weight % or less (Sample Nos. 71-75), higher Br was obtained than Sample<br>
No. 42. Particularly when the value of (SiO2 + CaO) was 0.15 weight %<br>
or less, and when the value of (Al2O3 + Cr2O3) was 0.1 weight % or less, Br<br>
exceeded 2700 G. On the other hand, Sample No. 81 having (SiO2 +<br>
CaO) exceeding 0.2 weight %, and Sample No. 82 having (Al2O3 + Cr2O3)<br>
exceeding 0.13 weight % showed lower Br than Sample No. 42.<br>
As a result of considering the variation of ?SiO2, ?Cr2O3, (SiO2 +<br>
CaO) and (Al2O3 + Cr2O3) shown in Tables 3 and 6, and the purity of<br>
recycled iron oxide shown in Table 1, it has been found that to achieve high<br>
Br, the total of a Si content calculated as SiO2 and a Ca content calculated<br>
as CaO is preferably 0.06 weight % or less, more preferably 0.05 weight %<br>
or less, particularly preferably 0.04 weight % or less, and the total of an Al<br>
content calculated as Al2O3 and a Cr content calculated as Cr2O3 is<br>
preferably 0.1 weight % or less, more preferably 0.09 weight % or less,<br>
particularly preferably 0.08 weight % or less in the iron oxide used.<br>
EXAMPLE 8, COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 5<br>
The coarse powder produced in EXAMPLE 5 was subjected to fine<br>
pulverization by a wet attritor. The concentration of a slurry was an initial<br>
slurry concentration calculated from the weight W1 (kg) of coarse ferrite<br>
powder and the weight W2 (kg) of water used, by the equation of<br>
[W1/(W1 + W2)] x 100 (%). After fine pulverization, ferrite powder for<br>
bonded magnets having an average diameter shown in Table 7 was<br>
produced in the same manner as in EXAMPLE 4 to evaluate the properties<br>
of the resultant bonded magnets. Br and iHc of each bonded magnet<br><br>
measured at 20° C are shown in Table 7. The fine pulverization of Sample<br>
No. 523 by an attritor only achieved fine powder of 1.17 µm, because of<br>
low slurry concentration. It has been found that when the initial slurry<br>
concentration was 66 weight % or more, it is difficult to carry out<br>
pulverization to an average diameter of 1.5 µm or less, resulting in a slurry<br>
containing much coarse powder.<br>
It has been found from Table 7 that when the initial slurry<br>
concentration at the time of fine pulverization by a wet attritor is 60-65<br>
weight %, high Br substantially corresponding to that obtained by dry ball<br>
milling can be obtained.<br>
EXAMPLE 9, COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 6<br>
Dry ball-milled fine powder having an average diameter of 1 µm in<br>
EXAMPLE 4 was formed to ferrite powder for bonded magnets (average<br>
diameter: 1.05-1.10 µm) in the same manner as in EXAMPLE 4 except for<br>
carrying out a heat treatment under the conditions shown in Table 8, and<br>
the properties of the resultant bonded magnets were evaluated. The<br>
results are shown in Table 8.<br>
It has been found from Table 8 that the heat treatment conditions are<br>
preferably 750-950°C x 0.5-3 hours. When a heat treatment was carried<br>
out at 750-800°C for over 3 hours, the saturation of iHc was observed.<br>
Agglomeration was observed by heating nearly under the conditions of<br>
1000°C x 0.2 hours, resulting in drastic decrease in Br.<br>
EXAMPLE 10, COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 7<br>
The same heat-treated ferrite powder as Sample No. 52 (EXAMPLE<br>
5) in Table 4 was subjected to wet disintegration under the conditions<br>
shown Table 9, and ferrite powder for bonded magnets having an average<br>
diameter of 1.05-1.06 µm was produced in the same manner as in<br>
EXAMPLE 5 to evaluate magnetic properties. The results are shown in<br>
Table 9.<br>
It has been found from Table 9 that when immersion in water,<br>
immersion in isopropyl alcohol, and agitation in water by a Henschel mixer<br>
(1 minute) or pulverization in water by an attritor (30 seconds) are carried<br>
out after the heat treatment, Br is improved. By this wet disintegration,<br>
?SiO2 became less than 0.02 weight %, and ?Cr2O3 became less than 0.001<br>
weight %.<br>
EXAMPLE 11, COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 8<br>
To produce magnet roll for copiers from ferrite powder, compounds<br>
A-E having the following compositions were prepared.<br>
The formulations of the compounds A-E were 91.5 parts by weight<br>
of ferrite powder for bonded magnets, 6.2 parts by weight of EEA (MB-<br>
870), 1 part by weight of a dispersant (DH-37), 0.5 parts by weight of a<br>
lubricant (Slipacks E), and 0.8 parts by weight of silicone oil (KF968,<br>
available from Shin-etsu Chemical Co., Ltd.). The other conditions were<br>
the same as in EXAMPLE 4 to produce each compound.<br>
(a) Compound A<br>
A compound obtained by mixing magnetic powder of Sample No.<br>
33 (EXAMPLE 4) in Table 3 with EEA.<br>
(b) Compound B<br>
A compound obtained by mixing ferrite powder having an average<br>
diameter of 1.14 µm produced under the same conditions as in EXAMPLE<br>
4 except for using La-Co-Zn coarse powder of Sample No. 6 in Table 2<br>
with EEA.<br>
(c) Compound C<br>
La-Zn coarse powder of Sample No. 7 in Table 2 was finely<br>
pulverized by a wet attritor (solvent: water) to an average diameter of 0.95<br>
µm. The resultant slurry was wet-molded in a magnetic field of 12 kOe to<br>
produce a green body, which was then dried, disintegrated by a jaw crusher<br>
and sieved to provide molding powder having an average diameter of 2.5<br>
µm. Next, a heat treatment was carried out at 830°C for 3 hours, and then<br>
immersion in water, drying, and disintegration by sieving were carried out<br>
in the same manner as in EXAMPLE 1 to provide anisotropic granulated<br>
powder. The compound C is an EEA compound containing such<br>
granulated powder,<br>
(d) Compound D<br>
The compound D is an EEA compound containing anisotropic<br>
granulated powder having an average diameter of 3 µm. This anisotropic<br>
granulated powder was produced as follows. First, La-Co coarse powder<br>
of Sample No. 3 in Table 1 was finely pulverized by a wet attritor (solvent:<br>
water) to an average diameter of 0.90 µm. The resultant slurry was wet-<br>
molded in a magnetic field of 10 kOe to produce a green body. After<br>
demagnetization, the green body was heat at 100°C or lower in the air to<br>
remove water and then cooled. After disintegration by a jaw crusher,<br>
sieving was carried out to provide powder having an average diameter of<br>
more than 2 µm and 15 µm or less. Next, a heat treatment was carried out<br>
at 750-1000°C for 1 hour, and then immersion in water, drying, and<br>
disintegration by sieving were carried out in the same manner as in<br>
EXAMPLE 4 to provide anisotropic granulated powder.<br>
A fraction separated from the resultant anisotropic granulated<br>
powder, which had an average diameter of 3 µm, was measured with<br>
respect to magnetic properties by VSM. Each anisotropic granulated<br>
powder and wax at a predetermined ratio and at a constant total weight<br>
were charged into a holder of VSM and sealed. Thereafter, while<br>
applying a parallel magnetic field of 5 kOe, VSM was heated to melt the<br>
wax and then cooled to solidify the wax in a state that magnetic powder<br>
was oriented. In this state, a demagnetization curve was obtained at room<br>
temperature to determine Br and iHc corrected to a state of 100-%<br>
magnetic powder. The results are shown in Figs. 3 and 4. When the<br>
heat treatment temperature was selected to 750-950°C, Br of 3.5-3.75 kG<br>
and iHc of 2.85-4.75 kOe were obtained. Incidentally, when the average<br>
diameter exceeded 10 µm, about 5% decrease in Br was observed when<br>
compared at the same heat treatment temperature in Fig. 3. The EEA<br>
compound was prepared by using the anisotropic granulated powder having<br>
an average diameter of 3 µm subjected to a heat treatment at 800°C for 1<br>
hour,<br>
(e) Compound E<br>
This is an EEA compound of COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 2<br>
containing the magnetic powder of Sample No. 43 in Table 3.<br>
Each of the compounds A-E was charged into a molding apparatus<br>
6 shown in Figs. 5 and 6, and made anisotropic by passing through an<br>
orientation die 7 mounted to a tip end of the molding apparatus 6. The<br>
resultant cylindrical molded article was cooled, demagnetized and then cut<br>
to a predetermined length. After a shaft 12 was fixed into a center hole of<br>
this integral molded article (outer diameter: 18 mm, inner diameter: 8 mm,<br>
length: 300 mm), unsymmetrical 4 magnetic poles were formed on a<br>
surface of the cylindrical bonded magnet. It was then assembled in a<br>
sleeve 2 made of an aluminum alloy having an outer diameter of 20 mm to<br>
obtain a magnet roll 1 having a radially anisotropic bonded magnet shown<br>
in Fig. 7.<br><br>
Table 10 shows the measurement results of a surface magnetic flux<br>
density (Bo) on a surface of the sleeve 2 at a center point in a longitudinal<br>
direction immediately above an N1 pole. A gap between an outer surface<br>
of the cylindrical anisotropic bonded magnet 11 and an outer surface of the<br>
sleeve 2 was 1.0 mm.<br>
It has been found from Table 10 that the use of the compounds A-D<br>
improves the surface magnetic flux density on the sleeve 2 of the magnet<br>
roll 1. The compounds C and D are good in moldability, showing<br>
molding efficiency (number of cylindrical bonded magnets 11 formed per<br>
unit time) 5-10% higher than the compounds A, B and E.<br>
Next, the cylindrical, radially anisotropic, bonded magnet formed<br>
from the compound A was cut to provide test pieces for the measurement<br>
of magnetic properties at 20°C. Br was 3030 G.<br>
The above cylindrical bonded magnet 11 is preferably in the form<br>
of a cylinder having an outer diameter D = 10-60 mm, a length L = 200-<br>
350 mm, and L/D =5, and it has preferably a small diameter of D = 10-30<br>
mm, particularly D = 10-20 mm and L/D =5 for small copiers or printers.<br>
Next, the cylindrical bonded magnets formed from the compounds<br>
A and D were measured with respect to a surface magnetic flux density on<br>
an outer surface along an N1 pole in a longitudinal direction. The results<br>
are shown in Figs. 8(a) and (b). As is clear from Figs. 8(a) and (b), the<br>
cylindrical bonded magnet formed from the compound D had smaller<br>
unevenness in a surface magnetic flux density in a longitudinal direction<br>
than the cylindrical bonded magnet formed from the compound A. This<br>
verifies that by using the anisotropic granulated powder, bonded magnets<br>
having improved evenness in a surface magnetic flux density can be<br>
obtained.<br>
The above EXAMPLES show the case of radial anisotropy, an<br>
extrusion molding method imparting polar anisotropy may be selected.<br>
The shape of the bonded magnet is not limited to a hollow cylinder, but any<br>
shape including solid cylinder may be adopted.<br>
Though the above EXAMPLES show Sr ferrite powder containing<br>
the R element and the M element, it is expected that Ba ferrite powder<br>
containing the R element and the M element also has higher Br (or higher<br>
Br and iHc) than those of the conventional Sr and/or Ba ferrite powder.<br>
Though the above EXAMPLES show injection molding and<br>
extrusion molding, compression molding is also applicable to produce<br>
bonded magnets having high Br and (BH)max.<br>
APPLICATIONS IN INDUSTRY<br>
High-performance ferrite powder for bonded magnets having higher<br>
Br (or higher Br and iHc) than the conventional Sr and/or Ba ferrite powder<br>
for bonded magnets can be obtained by adjusting to the above basic<br>
composition and by controlling the amounts of impurities of Si, Ca, Al and<br>
Cr. The bonded magnets obtained from such ferrite powder are<br>
advantageous over the conventional bonded magnets because of higher iHc<br>
and at least equivalent Br, as well as the reduced unevenness of a surface<br>
magnetic flux density.<br>
Particularly when the bonded magnet of the present invention is<br>
used, the resultant magnet roll can be provided with a lot of magnetic poles<br>
showing radial or polar anisotropy with reduced unevenness in a magnetic<br>
flux density in a longitudinal direction. The bonded magnet also has a<br>
good dimension stability even when it is produced by molding in a<br>
magnetic field.<br>
