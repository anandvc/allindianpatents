				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
A System for Screening the Breast Tissue<br>
Field Of The Invention<br>
The field of the present invention is ultrasonic scanning and diagnostics for cellular<br>
tissue.<br>
Background Of The Invention<br>
Ultrasonic probes have been used for scanning cellular tissue for many years.<br>
Presently, any medical ultrasound examination, whether of the heart, pelvis, abdomen, soft<br>
tissues or any other system, is usually displayed as a number of individual frames or<br>
pictures from a study performed in a dynamic movie-like manner. The usefulness of the<br>
scan, however, is dependent on the skill of the operator, who manipulates the probe by<br>
hand while watching the scan images on a monitor to identify areas of interest. Once these<br>
areas are identified, the operator usually records single or multiple single scan images<br>
showing those areas.<br>
Because the operator must choose a few frames from the large number generated<br>
during the scan, the process is open to error. The operator may fail to select an image of<br>
an important finding, or may select an image that misrepresents the overall findings. In<br>
addition, since the operator is manipulating the probe by hand, and the speed of the probe<br>
over the tissue cannot be correlated with the image capture rate of the probe, the coverage<br>
of the scanned tissue is somewhat haphazard. As a result, the operator does not record a<br>
series of images that represent a contiguous and complete set of images for the entire<br>
scanned tissue. Nor does the manual operation of the probe allow for entirely uniform<br>
coverage of the tissue, even if multiple passes are used.<br>
A second method of recording ultrasonic examinations is used for dynamic<br>
examinations such as echocardiography, where a dynamic recording is made on videotape.<br>
Unfortunately, this analog method is not matched to the digital sonographic recording of<br>
individual frames. Consequently, there is a great loss of detail that prevents the evaluation<br>
of individual frames, which limits the usefulness of the videotape for diagnosing tissue<br>
anomalies. The interpreting physician has no way to vary the speed of playback or to vary<br>
the size of the images. Nor can the physician vary the inherent contrast and brightness of<br>
the images, only the monitor settings. These difficulties lengthen the review time and<br>
prevent optimum viewing. In addition, the use of separate videotapes for individual<br>
patients is expensive, and creates a storage problem.<br>
Specific to screening asymptomatic women for occult breast cancer, there are two<br>
methods presently in widespread use, physical examination and mammography. Both of<br>
these methods are imperfect. Physical examination usually cannot detect cancers smaller<br>
than 1/2 inch in diameter. Some cancers have to be many times larger to be detected.<br>
Mammography is unable to detect as many as 30 percent of cancers smaller than 1/2 inch.<br>
About 5 to 10 percent of larger cancers are mammographically occult. Mammograms also<br>
use radiation and necessitate painful compression of the breasts, which discourage women<br>
from having routine mammograms.<br>
Although not well recognized by the medical community, ultrasound is very<br>
proficient at diagnosing breast cancers if the location of the abnormality is first discovered<br>
by another modality, such as mammography or physical examination. When using<br>
ultrasound as a screening method for the entire breast, however, malignancies are usually<br>
difficult to pick out of the background tissue. In the past there have been two schemes to<br>
use ultrasound for breast screening, but they failed to gain acceptance due to their<br>
unacceptably low success rate in finding cancers.<br>
One method was a water bath system with multiple ultrasound probes and the<br>
breast in a water bath that allowed generation of images of the whole breast in consecutive<br>
slices. These slices could be viewed in sequence at a rate of one every ten seconds.<br>
The second method was to videotape-record the scanning performed by a<br>
technician examining the entire breast. This method had the disadvantage of being<br>
somewhat haphazard in breast coverage. The variable speed of manual motion does not<br>
allow the tissue to be uniformly imaged because the speed is not synchronized to the frame<br>
capture rate of the ultrasound probe. Videotaping also results in a degradation of the<br>
images for the reasons described above.<br>
To date, no method has been developed to uniformly and reliably use ultrasound<br>
probes to create a contiguous and complete set of scan images for an entire area of cellular<br>
tissue, such as a human breast. Ultrasound is usually used to investigate areas of interest<br>
in cellular tissue that have already been identified by other screening methods such as<br>
mammograms, x-rays, and MRI-scans. Ultrasound is not ordinarily used as a screening<br>
tool for cellular tissue anomalies.<br>
Summary Of The Invention<br>
The present invention is directed to an improved system of ultrasonic scanning and<br>
diagnostics of cellular tissue. A sequence of cross-sectional ultrasonic images of tissue are<br>
generated, with means to determine the location of each individual image. The present<br>
invention also presents a systematic method for screening cellular tissue, using cross-<br>
sectional ultrasonic scans.<br>
In a first separate aspect of the present invention, an ultrasonic probe is propelled<br>
over the tissue to be scanned at a uniform speed. Uniform imaging of the tissue can be<br>
achieved.<br>
In a second separate aspect of the present invention, an ultrasonic probe is<br>
propelled over the tissue to be scanned at a uniform speed. The speed of the probe over<br>
the tissue is matched to the image capture rate of the ultrasound scanner. Further uniform<br>
imaging of the tissue can be achieved.<br>
In a third separate aspect of the present invention, an ultrasonic probe is propelled<br>
over the tissue to be scanned at a uniform speed. The angle of the ultrasonic probe may be<br>
adjusted prior to and during the scanning process to maintain optimal contact with the<br>
tissue being scanned. Further uniform imaging of the tissue can be achieved.<br>
In a fourth separate aspect of the present invention, an ultrasonic probe is propelled<br>
over the tissue to be scanned at a uniform velocity, accounting for velocity variations<br>
caused by changes in the angle of the probe in following the contours of the tissue.<br>
Further uniform imaging of the tissue can be achieved.<br>
In a fifth separate aspect of the present invention, an ultrasonic probe is propelled<br>
over the tissue to be scanned at a uniform speed in a substantially straight line, and the<br>
probe's location is adjusted laterally along that substantially straight line to account for<br>
changes in the angle of the probe caused by following the contours of the tissue. Further<br>
uniform imaging of the tissue can be achieved.<br>
In a sixth separate aspect of the present invention, an ultrasonic probe is propelled<br>
over the tissue to be scanned at a uniform speed. The image data from the ultrasonic<br>
probe is converted and stored in a format compatible with a viewer. The data are viewed<br>
with a specialized viewer that allows rapid, sequential playback of the images. An<br>
improved method of scanning tissue for cancers and anomalies is thus achieved. The<br>
viewer can have the capability of allowing the user to select points of interest on<br>
individual scan images, and also select a known reference point on the same or another<br>
individual image. The viewer then calculates the distances between the two points in three<br>
dimensions. The exact location of the point of interest on the patient may thus be<br>
determined.<br>
In a seventh separate aspect of the present invention, location data are collected for<br>
each image frame. This allows an ultrasonic probe to be operated without need for<br>
completely uniform speed, and still allow for accurate location of features or anomalies.<br>
In an eighth separate aspect of the present invention, the images can be viewed to<br>
allow the user to select points of interest on individual scan images, and also select a<br>
known reference point on the same or another individual image, which in breast cancer<br>
screening is usually the nipple. Distances between the two points in three dimensions can<br>
then be calculated. The exact location of the point of interest on the patient may thus be<br>
determined by measuring from the nipple to the point of interest.<br>
In a ninth separate aspect of the present invention, in breast tissue scanning a pad is<br>
placed over the nipple that has different ultrasonic characteristics than breast tissue, and<br>
the scan is performed. The pad shows up in the scan images and identifies the nipple as a<br>
reference point, and reduces the loss of sonic information behind the nipple (ultrasonic<br>
shadowing).<br>
In a tenth separate aspect of the present invention, the breast tissue scanning of the<br>
ninth aspect further includes a covering placed over the breast during scanning to hold the<br>
breast and nipple pad in place and reduce ultrasonic shadowing. Improved imaging is thus<br>
possible.<br>
In an eleventh separate aspect of the present invention, combinations of the<br>
foregoing aspects are contemplated to provide increased advantage.<br>
Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a system and<br>
method that will allow cellular tissue to be reliably screened for anomalies by ultrasonic<br>
scanning. Other and further objects and advantages will appear hereafter.<br>

Detailed Description Of A Preferred Embodiment<br>
As shown in Figure 1, a preferred embodiment is comprised of a patient platform 2<br>
to steady the patient and provide a base for the support member 4, the probe carrier 5<br>
connected with the support member 4 that is capable of translational movement to guide<br>
the probe across the tissue to be scanned, a standard medical ultrasound scanning device 6<br>
with an associated probe 8, a remote control device 10 that operates the probe carrier 5, a<br>
standard computer 12, a connection device 14 between the ultrasound device 6 and the<br>
computer 12, and a viewing program that obtains image data from the ultrasound device<br>
and converts it into image data compatible with the viewing program and displays the<br>
images. The medical ultrasound scanning device 6 is a machine that sends and receives<br>
signals from the associated ultrasound probe 8, both of which are usually sold as a single<br>
unit. The ultrasound scanning device 6 with associated probe 8, computer 12, and<br>
connection device 14 are commercially available.<br>
The mechanical carrier 5 holding the ultrasound probe 8 can be connected with the<br>
ultrasound scanner 6. Synchronization between the probe holder mechanical carrier 5 and<br>
the ultrasound scanner 6 can be employed while recording the scans.<br>
Probe Carrier<br>
In order to obtain substantially parallel and contiguous images, a mechanical<br>
device holding the ultrasound probe 8 propels the probe across the tissue to be scanned at<br>
a uniform rate. In a preferred embodiment shown in Figure 3, the mechanism holding the<br>
probe 8 is mounted to a patient platform 16 that steadies the patient during the exam and<br>
acts as a base for the mechanism. The carrier carriage 18 shown in Figures 2 and 3 is<br>
comprised of two parallel vertical members attached to rails 20 beneath the platform and a<br>
horizontal member that is attached to the top of the two vertical members, as shown in<br>
Figure 4. The rails 20 allow the carriage 18 to move along the length of the platform, or<br>
the x-axis, as shown in Figures 2 and 3. Attached to the horizontal member between the<br>
two vertical members is another vertical member with an attached semi U-shaped member,<br>
called the carrier arm 22, which is attached to a carrier 24 holding an ultrasound probe 8.<br>
The carrier arm 22 is attached in such a manner that allows it to move along both the y-<br>
axis and the z-axis, so that it can move both across the patient and nearer/further from the<br>
patient on the platform, as shown in Figure 4. The carrier 24 itself is articulated to hold<br>
the probe at any desired angle relative to the patient by rotating about the x and y axes.<br>
The carrier 24 may hold the probe 8 at a fixed angle during scanning, or can adjusted<br>
during the scanning process to keep the probe 8 perpendicular to the patient's skin (or any<br>
other preferred orientation).<br>
To protect the carriage assembly when not in use, and to prevent the patient from<br>
becoming entangled in it when first lying on the platform, the assembly is housed in a<br>
"garage" 26 at one end of the platform 16. In a preferred embodiment, the carriage 18 is<br>
propelled along the x-axis of the platform 16 by one or more motors that are controlled by<br>
a microprocessor. The carrier arm 22 is also moved along its two axes during scanning by<br>
one or more motors controlled by one or more microprocessors. The microprocessors)<br>
can be separate from the computer 12 that operates the viewing program (described<br>
below), or the computer 12 can be used for this purpose. The carrier arm 22 moves along<br>
the z-axis to maintain consistent contact between the probe 8 and the patient's skin during<br>
scanning. The carrier arm 22 maintains a constant pressure of the probe 8 on the patient,<br>
with a user-selected preset value. This pressure is monitored during the scan and an<br>
override function will move the carrier arm 22 up and away from the patient in the z-axis<br>
if a maximum pressure level is detected. In another embodiment, the operator will<br>
maintain the pressure manually during the scanning process, and the pressure may be<br>
measured using pressure transducer(s) in close proximity to the probe head. The carrier<br>
arm 22 will move upward to clear the patient at the end of the scan. A manual override on<br>
the remote control 10 is also available to move the carrier arm 22 away from the patient<br>
when there is a panic or emergency situation.<br>
In other embodiments, the carriage 18 and carrier arm 22 can be either on a parallel<br>
track arrangement (one sided or multi-sided), or be comprised of an articulating arm or<br>
some other contrivance, located over, underneath or adjacent to the patient (with or<br>
without the use of a patient platform) positioned either upright or prone. The carrier arm<br>
22 need not be supported by a carriage assembly connected to the patient platform, but<br>
could be independently suspended from the ceiling, wall, or floor, providing translational<br>
movement in both the x and y directions relative to the patient platform. The carrier<br>
mechanism could be similar to carriage mechanisms currently used to support x-ray<br>
machines, with means added to provide the requisite movement of the probe. The probe<br>
may be supported and propelled by a mechanical carrier by any means (manually,<br>
mechanically, electrically, hydraulically, pneumatically or by any other means, with or<br>
without control feedback), or any combination of methods. These methods, singularly or<br>
combined may be utilized to control the probe in the X, Y and Z-axes. Gravity may also<br>
be employed to provide the requisite pressure of the probe on the patient, or assist in the<br>
propulsion of the probe across the tissue.<br>
The probe 8 may be designed as a permanent or removable component of the<br>
mechanical carrier 24. The carrier 24 may be designed with or without an onboard<br>
integrated ultrasound machine 6, ultrasound probe 8, and or ultrasound probe interface.<br>
As shown in Figures 4A and 4B, the carrier 24 can be articulated to change the<br>
angular position of the probe 8 prior to or during scanning either manually, or by one or<br>
more motors controlled by one or more microprocessors. The microprocessor(s) can be<br>
separate from the computer 12 that operates the viewing program (described below), or the<br>
computer 12 can be used for this purpose. If the probe itself has an articulating head, the<br>
carrier may not need to be articulated.<br>
In an embodiment where the probe's 8 angular position is adjusted automatically<br>
during scanning, the pitch and roll adjustments are triggered by one or more displacement<br>
transducers positioned around the ultrasound probe 8. In this embodiment, all the data<br>
related to the position and angle of the probe 8 may be provided to the viewing program to<br>
allow the images to be correlated with their corresponding location on the patient. The<br>
position data may allow the program to compensate for the overlapping of, or gaps<br>
between images. The measurement system can be by any means or convention and may<br>
consist of any or all of x, y, and z-axes and/or the probe angular position.<br>
The speed of the carrier 24 holding the probe 8 is precisely controlled by a<br>
microprocessor. The speed may be correlated with the capture rate of the ultrasonic<br>
scanning device 6. The uniform speed of the probe face 9 over the tissue results in images<br>
that are uniformly spaced, which allows the viewing program (discussed below) to<br>
calculate the position of a selected point on any image. In an embodiment where the probe<br>
is held at a fixed angle during the scan, the uniform spacing is all that is necessary to<br>
determine the position of each frame of the scan on the patient. The ultrasound scanning<br>
device 6 may act as a controller in communication with the probe 8 to sequentially activate<br>
the probe 8 as it moves across the tissue, but any other controller could be used to activate<br>
the probe, including a computer linked to the probe or the scanning device or both.<br>
The operator may determine the amount of area to be scanned, and input various<br>
parameters of that area into the computer's 12 positioning program. For example, when<br>
used for breast tissue scanning, the operator will measure across the skin, providing the<br>
total length to be traversed by the probe 8. In current practice, the width of the tissue<br>
scanned by the ultrasound probe 8 is generally too small to capture an image of an entire<br>
organ such as the breast. As a result, several adjacent passes are performed to provide<br>
complete coverage. Each pass (called a scan row 30) will have some overlap with the<br>
preceding pass, to achieve full coverage and eliminate the potential for missing features at<br>
the fringes of the scan. Prior to each successive pass, the carrier arm 22 lifts away from<br>
the patient, moves along the y-axis across the breast and along the x-axis to the top of the<br>
of the area to be scanned to position itself for the next scan row 30, then lowers itself<br>
along the z-axis onto the patient. Alternatively, the carrier arm 22 may be raised or<br>
lowered manually.<br>
A scan row 30 contains a plurality of individual images or frames 28, typically<br>
about 200 to 300 for a breast. Figure 5 depicts how the frames 28 in scan rows 30 are<br>
aligned on a typical breast scan, but for clarity, no overlap is shown. A scan row 30 can<br>
be thought of as a stack of photographic slides, each slide representing an individual frame<br>
28. The frames 28 are evenly spaced, which may be accomplished by uniform motion of<br>
the probe 8 and uniform timing of the scans. The frames 28 are most conveniently<br>
substantially parallel to each other.<br>
In an embodiment where the probe's angle is changed during scanning, the probe 8<br>
is attached to a carrier 24 that allows the probe 8 to be pivoted in any direction. The roll<br>
plane 11 refers to the forward and backward pivoted movement of the probe 8 along the x-<br>
axis at the roll plane pivot 100. See Figures 4A and 4B. The pitch plane 13 refers to the<br>
left and right pivoted movement of the probe 8 along the y-axis at the pitch plane pivot<br>
102. The pitch and roll pivots 100, 103 allow the probe to maintain full contact between<br>
the probe face 9 and the skin surface by allowing the probe 8 to be positioned at a<br>
perpendicular angle to the skin regardless of skin contour, to allow for optimal ultrasonic<br>
imaging. A commercially available angle sensor 25 may be attached to the carrier 24 so<br>
that it is parallel to the probe 8 at all times in both the roll plane 11 (x-axis) and the pitch<br>
plane 13 (y-axis), see Figures 4A and 4B The angle sensor 25 sends the roll and the pitch<br>
angles to the positioning program in the computer 12 at short regular intervals, one tenth<br>
of a second in a preferred embodiment. Figure 15 is a schematic diagram of the signals<br>
between the angle sensor, the computer and the motors.<br>
Where the probe 8 is dynamically angled as the probe 8 is moved over the tissue,<br>
particularly where the tissue is not flat, several problems arise in achieving proper speed<br>
and location during the scan. For example, when trying to uniformly scan a convex<br>
object, such as a breast, the degree of convexity of the breast is unknown in both the 'x'<br>
and 'y' axes. Using a breast as an example, if the probe 8 is propelled at a constant speed<br>
along the x-axis, the speed of the probe face 9, in reference to the skin, will increase on the<br>
upslope and the downslope of the breast. In addition, since the roll plane pivot 100 in the<br>
carrier 24 is some distance above where the probe face 9 touches the skin (called the<br>
fulcrum length 27), the probe face 9 and the carrier 24 will not be in the same position<br>
along the x-axis when the probe 8 is pivoted in the roll plane. Thus the carrier 24 will be<br>
behind the probe face 9 on upslopes and in front of it on downslopes.<br>
Location sensors could be used to track the location of the carrier 24, and the<br>
angular position of the probe 8, for accurate location and speed corrections. Sensors may<br>
determine the carrier's 24 location by counting the number of rotations of the motors<br>
controlling the movement of the carrier arm 22 in the 'x' and 'y' directions. The probe's 8<br>
angular position may be determined by the angle sensor 25. These location sensors are<br>
"coupled" with the probe even though no direct connection to the probe may exist.<br>
Speed correction over the skin may be implemented with an angle sensor 25<br>
attached to the probe 8 that sends the probe's 8 angle in both the 'x' and 'y' axes to the<br>
controlling computer 12 continuously, at least ten times per second. The change of angle<br>
in the V axis may be used to properly adjust the velocity for the next increment of time<br>
by applying a two-term trigonometric formula. The first term maintains a constant speed<br>
along the skin by decreasing the horizontal speed of the carrier 24 as the probe 8 gains<br>
vertical speed by climbing or descending along the slope of the breast The second term<br>
accounts for the effect of the pivot in displacing the carrier arm 22 relative to the probe<br>
face 9. Therefore, the angle sensor 25 provides angle data to the positioning program<br>
residing on the computer 12, which controls the x-axis motor to produce uniform velocity<br>
of the pivoted probe 8 over the skin of the breast, while continuously changing only the<br>
horizontal (x-axis) velocity. To produce the desired constant velocity, the positioning<br>
program uses the cosine of current roll angle to calculate the x-axis motion vector. The<br>
positioning program also compensates for the horizontal component of the offset of the<br>
carrier 24 from the probe face 9 produced by the position of the roll plane pivot 100 in the<br>
carrier 24 being above the probe face 9. The positioning program uses the absolute<br>
change of the sines of the roll angle between the present angle and the angle in the<br>
previous time interval, using the following formula:<br>
HV = (DV * cos(NRA) + (FL/TI * (isin(ORA) - sin(NRA)D)<br>
Where:<br>
HV = Horizontal Velocity (of the carrier arm 22 necessary to produce DV at the present<br>
roll angle)<br>
DV = Default Velocity (desired velocity of the probe face 9 over the skin)<br>
FL = Fulcrum Length (distance between the roll plane pivot 100 and<br>
the center of the probe face 9)<br>
TI = Time Interval (time in seconds between angle measurements)<br>
ORA = Old Roll Angle (Angle of probe 8 along x-axis in last time increment)<br>
NRA = New Roll Angle (Angle of probe 8 along x-axis at present)<br>
If the computer 12 clock and the software that receives signals from the angle<br>
sensor 25 are not precisely matched, the time intervals (TI) in the above equation can be<br>
slightly different. Although in a preferred embodiment the cycles are sufficiently long to<br>
cancel out each of the small differences, to prevent errors introduced by these variable<br>
length time intervals, an additional correction factor can be used. Velocities can be<br>
requested for set intervals to achieve specific distances along the x and y-axes, but the<br>
inexactness of the time intervals may result in approximate rather than exact distances<br>
with each move. These small errors summated over an entire row could be significant and<br>
result in errors in row length and width. The solution is to interrogate the exact position of<br>
the probe 8 along the length of the x and y-axes after each time interval, and correct any<br>
small error during that time interval and convert that distance into a velocity to be added<br>
or subtracted during the next time interval. The positioning program records the number<br>
of rotations of the motors driving the horizontal (x-axis and y-axis) motion, from which<br>
the exact position of the probe 8 can be calculated.<br>
The fact that the probe can be angled in the pitch plane 13 creates an additional<br>
lateral correction factor, using data from the location sensors. Like the roll plane pivot<br>
100, the pitch plane pivot 102 is above the probe face 9, so any angulation in the y-axis as<br>
a result of the curvature of the tissue, such as on a breast, will cause the probe 8 to deviate<br>
from its straight-line course. If this lateral movement is not corrected, it will result in a<br>
curved row, and gaps in tissue coverage. Again, using the change in angle sent by the<br>
angle sensor 25 and a one-term trigonometric formula, the positioning program on the<br>
computer 12 can signal a y-axis motor to continuously change the lateral position of the<br>
probe 8 to maintain straight rows. To maintain straight travel over a convex surface, the<br>
positioning program calculates the correction of the y-axis position, using the change of<br>
the sines of the previous and the present pitch angles. The effect of canting the probe 8 in<br>
the pitch plane 13 adds another term to compensate for additional movement of the probe<br>
This term is subtracted from the first term, and is the change of the cosines of the previous<br>
and the present pitch angles, using the following formula:<br>
YCD = (PFW * (sin(OPA) - sin(NPA))) - ½ PFW * (cos(OPA) - cos(NPA))<br>
Where:<br>
YCD = y-axis Correction Distance (of the probe 8 to correct for the offset from the<br>
change in y-axis angle from the previous time increment)<br>
PFW = Probe Face Width (width of the probe face 9)<br>
OPA = Old Pitch Angle (Angle of probe 8 along y-axis in last time increment)<br>
NPA = New Pitch Angle (Angle of probe 8 along y-axis at present)<br>
To maintain complete coverage, the carrier 24 must move the width of the probe<br>
face 9 over the skin, rather than along the 'y' axis, when beginning its next row. The<br>
sensors may be used to provide location data to the positioning program, which<br>
continuously records the maximum y-axis angle and uses the maximum angle in each row<br>
in a one-term trigonometric formula, and calculates the distance to move the probe 8 along<br>
the y-axis so that no skip area will occur. To assure that no tissue will be skipped, the<br>
rows overlap slightly, and the initial starting position of each row should be calculated to<br>
assure overlap. The positioning program uses the difference of the sines of the initial pitch<br>
angle and the maximum pitch angle in a row to calculate the distance to move the carrier<br>
24 on the y-axis to begin the next row, using the following formula:<br>
NRO = (cos(MPA) * PFW) - OA<br>
Where:<br>
NRO = Next Row Offset (of the probe 8 to avoid skip areas)<br>
PFW = Probe Face Width (width of the probe face 9)<br>
MPA = Maximum Pitch Angle (in the present row)<br>
OA = Overlap Amount (of the contiguous rows)<br>
In the embodiment where the probe's 8 angular position is dynamically adjusted<br>
during scanning to follow the contours of the tissue being scanned, the tops of the frames<br>
28 are substantially evenly spaced, and the tissue contours will be sufficiently gentle that<br>
adjacent frames 28 will remain substantially parallel to each other, although they may<br>
differ by as much as a few degrees. Although adjacent frames 28 within a single scan row<br>
30 are substantially parallel, frames 28 may become progressively less parallel as they are<br>
separated by an increasing number of frames 28. Frames 28 in two adjacent scan rows 30<br>
are not necessarily substantially parallel.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, an organ such as a breast can be scanned in one<br>
segment, with the scan rows 30 progressing across the entire breast from lateral to medial,<br>
or vice-versa. Figure 5 depicts a series of scan rows 30 comprising one segment. In other<br>
embodiments, each breast may be scanned in two segments, with the first scan row of each<br>
segment aligned at the center of the breast at the nipple and successive scan rows 30 being<br>
progressively further from the nipple.<br>
Viewing Program<br>
A preferred embodiment of the viewing program (or viewer) is a streamlined,<br>
monolithic, 32-bit Windows application designed to run on Windows 95, Windows 98, NT<br>
4, and Windows 2000. A preferred embodiment is implemented to interface with and<br>
acquire data from the General Electric Logiq 700 medical ultrasound scanner. The<br>
viewing program could, of course, be written to run on other types of computer systems<br>
and future versions of operating systems, and to interface with other types of scanning<br>
devices. As used in the claims, "computer" generically refers to any suitable device using<br>
one or more microprocessors to process data.<br>
The viewing program's monolithic structure and relatively small size allow it to be<br>
bundled with the image data for ease of transport and viewing flexibility. In most cases,<br>
complete scan data for a patient and the program can be placed on a single CD, allowing<br>
the user to transport a number of patient scans in a relatively small package, and view<br>
them on any computer that is compatible with the software on the CD. Although it would<br>
be even more convenient to transmit scans via e-mail, the current speed and size<br>
limitations of e-mail make sending the entire scan impractical. If desired, however, the<br>
viewing program can select small segments of the scan data and bundle it with the viewing<br>
program, for a small data package that is practical to send via current e-mail systems.<br>
Other delivery options could also be utilized, such as streaming video over the internet, or<br>
discrete file downloads using file compression to speed download time. In addition, the<br>
viewer can export or print single frames 28 in a standard image format, such as bitmap.<br>
In other embodiments, the viewing program could be designed to operate solely on<br>
a computer on which it resides, or it could be resident on a server in a client-server<br>
environment. The program could also be non-monolithic, using Java or a similar<br>
language, in a network-centric environment.<br>
In a preferred embodiment shown in Figure 1, the viewer program controls the<br>
scanning operation and data offloading via a connection device 14, such as a network<br>
TCP/IP interface. Other connection devices could be used, or with certain scanners, none<br>
may be needed. The General Electric Logiq 700 ultrasonic scanning device has an internal<br>
buffer that can store a finite amount of image data before offloading is required to clear<br>
the buffer for another scan. Other scanning devices have no such buffer, but instead<br>
provide an output of streaming data as the scan is being performed, and the program is<br>
capable of acquiring image data from a variety of scanning devices.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the computer acts as a receiver and recorder for the<br>
ultrasonic images obtained from the ultrasonic scanning device. As shown in Figure 6, a<br>
preferred embodiment uses a handshake sequence between the viewer and scanner to<br>
begin the scan acquisition process 32. The viewer then invokes the scanner to clear its<br>
internal frame buffer 34 and then to acquire a scan row to its internal buffer 36. The<br>
viewer freezes the scanner buffer 38, determines the number of frames 28 in the buffer,<br>
their dimensions and pixel format 40, initializes a new scan row in the image file 42, reads<br>
individual frames 28 from the buffer 44, counts the frame format 46 and writes them into<br>
the image file 48 on a data storage device. It then repeats the acquisition process until all<br>
the frames 28 in the scan row are processed 50, and terminates the scan row in the file 52.<br>
It then starts all over with additional scan rows 30 until the entire scan is acquired in the<br>
image file 54. A preferred embodiment of the viewer uses a proprietary image file format,<br>
which contains a header for patient information and scan information ("image file"), but<br>
images could also be converted into standardized formats such as DICOM.<br>
Figure 7 is a flow chart showing the user interface for the data transfer process<br>
from the scanner to the computer. The user creates a new file by choosing from the file<br>
menu 56, specifies a name for the new file 58, enters the patient data and relevant<br>
information 60, makes a selection from the data menu 62, and specifies what segment of<br>
the breast is about to be acquired 64. The user then begins the acquisition process 66, and<br>
frames 28 are then offloaded sequentially from the scanner's frame buffer via a connection<br>
device 14, such as a network interface, then normalized, compressed losslessly (if desired)<br>
and written sequentially to the image file, said file recorded on a data storage device.<br>
When all buffered frames are processed, the viewer terminates the constructed row in the<br>
image file 68. Another scan row can then be acquired and so on, or the interface to the<br>
scanner may be terminated 70. For offloading streaming data, the program performs a<br>
real-time write-through.<br>
Acquiring The Data<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the viewer creates (and subsequently displays)<br>
proprietary image files, the format of which consists of a file header 72, a patient<br>
information block 74, and zero or more blocks of scan row frames 76, as shown in Figure<br>
8. The patient information block 74 contains not only information about the patient, but<br>
also information about the scan itself, such as the depth and width of the scan, length of<br>
the scan row, speed of the carrier 24 during the scan, the number of frames per second<br>
captured by the scanner, the spacing between each frame, etc<br>
In another embodiment where the probe's angular position is dynamically adjusted<br>
during the scan, the viewer program may record on a data storage device the angular<br>
position of each frame and other information for each frame. The angular position data<br>
can be provided to the viewer program though the scanner 6, from angle sensor 25<br>
attached to the probe 8 or the carrier 24, or from an intermediary computer program that<br>
gathers this data.<br>
The viewer is implemented to be largely independent of the particular scanner<br>
hardware with which it is paired. A specific module written for each scanner is<br>
responsible for "normalizing" data from the internal format used by that particular scanner<br>
to the format used within an image file. The computer acts as a conversion device to<br>
convert this scanner data into the viewer's image file format. Scan row frame elements<br>
stored in an image file are written in a format optimized for rapid rendering during<br>
display. In a preferred embodiment, the viewer is run on computers using a WFN 32<br>
operating system, and scan frames 28 are written to image files in an 8-bit format that<br>
closely mirrors 8-bit grayscale Windows DEB (device-independent bitmap) format. This<br>
allows the images to be efficiently displayed on a Windows computer with practically no<br>
routine translation.<br>
Displaying The Images<br>
After acquiring, converting, and storing the scan data, the second major task of the<br>
viewer is to display the scan images. The viewer opens a previously created image file<br>
and renders sequential scan row frames within its interface in a "movie-like" manner. The<br>
images can be played at variable speed, backward or forward, and can pause on a single<br>
frame.<br>
The user interface for the viewing program may look and operate in largely the<br>
same manner as commercially available digital video players, such as Microsoft Windows<br>
Media Player, with buttons for Play, Pause, Stop, a slider bar to move back and forth<br>
within segments, etc. The playback features may utilize standard Windows input/output<br>
operations commonly used in digital video applications. A generalized flow diagram<br>
showing the user interface steps for playback operation is shown in Figure 9.<br>
One of the viewer features is a location function, which determines the physical<br>
location (on the patient) of any point on any frame 28 given any selected reference point<br>
on the same frame, or on a different frame. For example, if a physician finds an<br>
abnormality on one frame, he needs to then be able to locate some prominent feature<br>
elsewhere in the frame data, i.e., the nipple or a temporary mark placed by the operator,<br>
and then find the position of the abnormality relative to that reference point.<br>
The user interface for the location feature operates as shown in the flowchart in<br>
Figure 10. The user marks the point-of-interest ("POl") on a particular frame 28 being<br>
viewed 78 by double-clicking it with the computer mouse 80. An overlapped window<br>
then appears, and within that window a small display pane shows "thumbnail"-sized<br>
sonograph frames taken from the scan rows (actually, the same row "segment") in which<br>
the abnormality lies 82. The user can then traverse through the thumbnailed frames until<br>
he locates a reference frame containing a reference point ("RP") he wishes to use 84. Jn<br>
the case of a breast scan, the RP will often be the nipple, which can be positively identified<br>
by placing a special pad 120 over the nipple during the scan, readily identifiable on the<br>
viewer image. The user can then mark a point on that reference frame using the mouse 84<br>
The viewer program immediately calculates the first position relative to the reference<br>
point 86 and displays the results (in both textual and graphical format) to the user 88. The<br>
user then closes the dialog box to end the function 90.<br>
To implement the location function, the viewer takes advantage of the data known<br>
about the scan, which is written in the image file's header as part of the data acquisition<br>
process. Such information includes the width of the frame, and the distance between<br>
subsequent frames in a particular scan row, and the offset between scan rows. Within an<br>
individual frame, the location function calculates the position of a user-selected point by<br>
proportional math, using the number of image data points (pixels) in the height and width,<br>
and the size of the frame, to calculate the distance of the point from the sides of the frame.<br>
The program counts the number of pixels across the width of the frame, then the user-<br>
selected pixel position number is multiplied by the frame width and divided by the total<br>
number of pixels. For example, assuming the frame width is 4 centimeters, the program<br>
counts 400 pixels across that width, and the user selected a point at pixel position 100: 100<br>
* 4 cm / 400 = 1 cm. So the selected point is 1 centimeter from the side of the frame. The<br>
program then performs a similar calculation to determine the selected point's distance<br>
from the top of the frame. Figure 10 depicts this process and also shows how the location<br>
function determines the distances and angles from a user-selected point of interest (POI) to<br>
a user-selected reference point (RP), using the known values and simple trigonometry 86.<br>
In breast cancer screening, the POI is usually a suspected cancer, and the RP is the nipple.<br>
The substantially uniform motion of the probe 8 results in evenly spaced frames<br>
28, and thus the distance from a reference frame to a particular frame is calculated by<br>
counting the number of frames between them and multiplying by the spacing 86. In<br>
addition, the overlap of each scan row is known, and thus if the RP is in a different scan<br>
row than the POI, determining the location is a simple matter of determining the overlap<br>
and measuring the distance, and using trigonometry to make any angular and remaining<br>
distance calculations 86. Therefore, counting the frames from the RP and taking into<br>
account their overlap provides the location of each individual image.<br>
In a preferred embodiment where the angular position of the probe is dynamically<br>
adjusted during the scanning process, the viewing program may obtain each frame's<br>
angular position during the scar, from the angle sensor 25, along with the other<br>
information described above. Using that information, the location function may again use<br>
simple trigonometry to calculate the distances between the RP and the POI.<br>
Another feature of the viewer is its ability to accurately measure the distance<br>
between two user-selected points on a single frame. This allows the user to measure<br>
anomalies or features found in the images. The process for measuring is very similar to<br>
the location function process. Using the known values for frame depth and width, the<br>
measuring function uses proportional math to determine the distance between the two<br>
points. To measure diagonally across a frame, proportional math is used to determine the<br>
lengths of the triangle legs, and simple trigonometry is used to calculate the length of the<br>
hypotenuse, which is the distance between the points.<br>
Carrier-less Embodiment<br>
It is possible to obtain the sequential scans without the use of a carrier. The probe<br>
may be coupled with one or more location sensors to provide location data that is<br>
correlated with each individual frame. The term "coupled" means the sensors could be<br>
attached to the probe itself, or used to track the probe's movement without actual<br>
attachment. These sensors may provide feedback to the operator to move the probe over<br>
the tissue at the correct speed, and to start each scan row in the correct position. This will<br>
allow sufficiently complete coverage of the tissue without the need for a mechanized<br>
carrier. Alternatively, to obtain relatively uniform spacing of the frames, a speed sensor<br>
on the probe could signal the ultrasound scanning device to vary the frame capture rate to<br>
match the speed of the probe as it is moved across the tissue.<br>
This camer-less embodiment does not necessarily rely on the precise movement of<br>
the carrier to provide uniform spacing between the frames of a scan row in order to<br>
calculate distances between frames. Because location data are available for each frame,<br>
the location function of the viewer can use the location information of the POI frame and<br>
compare it to the location information of the RP frame, and make the requisite distance<br>
and trigonometric calculations to determine the distances from the RP to the POI.<br>
The location sensors can be arranged in a variety of implementations. A simple<br>
inclinometer can be used to determine the orientation of the probe in two or three axes.<br>
The location of the probe face 9 could be tracked by an inertial sensor system, or a laser or<br>
infrared system, or a radio frequency local positioning system. Alternatively, a simple<br>
wheel device could be used to measure distances as well as the speed the probe is being<br>
moved over the tissue. Alternatively, an optical movement sensor, such as those<br>
commonly used in optical mice, or a laser interferometer, could be attached to the probe to<br>
track its movement. When used for scanning breast tissue in conjunction with a covering,<br>
the covering could be made of some type of fabric that is compatible with an optica)<br>
movement sensor. All of these systems could use a point on the body as a reference<br>
location, such as the nipple when the system is used for breast scanning.<br>
Method For Tissue Screening<br>
The above-described devices, the probe, scanner, carrier, and viewing program,<br>
can be combined to provide a method to scan for anomalies in cellular tissue, such as<br>
cancers. The tissue is scanned, and the user views the images on a computer, rapidly<br>
scanning through the images in a "movie-like" fashion. This technique causes any<br>
anomalies in the tissue to become visible during the rapid sequential playback, as they<br>
distort or disrupt normal fibrous planes or sheets The user can then run the images back<br>
and forth until the frame containing the anomaly is found, and the user can mark that<br>
anomaly and locate it using the location function of the program. The viewer program<br>
emits an audible and/or visual signal that marks the end of each scan row 30 or segment to<br>
allow the user to know the approximate location without having to look away from the<br>
images. The viewer can also play a continuous loop with user-selected start and end<br>
points. Follow-up studies can be performed using the location information, including a<br>
more focused ultrasound investigation, biopsy, etc.<br>
Individual images can be manipulated using image software such as Photoshop,<br>
using filters and other manipulation techniques to enhance the appearance of the<br>
anomalies and make them more visible, including image magnification. Brightness and<br>
contrast of the frames can be adjusted. In addition, a variety of image enhancement<br>
algorithms are commonly known in the art and the viewer program allows them to be used<br>
"on the fly" as the images arc displayed in rapid succession.<br>
It is anticipated that the image review process could eventually be automated, once<br>
software is developed to identify any anomalies. If necessary, the user could then study<br>
the images to determine the accuracy of the software's identification.<br>
For scanning breast tissue specifically, a preferred methodology is as follows. The<br>
mechanical probe carrier 24 is used, and depending upon the size of the probe, the breast<br>
may be scanned in strips or in its entirety, in either multiple passes or a single pass,<br>
respectively. The breast may be scanned with or without a covering. Figures 11A and<br>
1 IB show a bra-like covering 92 that may aid in holding the breast in position for<br>
screening, as well as assisting in uniform integrity of image gathering by reducing<br>
information loss from ultrasonic shadowing. The covering 92 also provides some modesty<br>
for the patient. Current ultrasound technology requires the use of sonographic coupling<br>
agent, usually a gel, to exclude any air between the probe and the skin. Therefore, any<br>
such covering 92 would have to be capable of absorbing the gel, be relatively transparent<br>
to ultrasonic energy, and have a sufficiently loose weave so that any air trapped between<br>
the skin and the covering 92 may easily escape. The covering 92 could be pre-<br>
impregnated with the coupling agent, or the agent could be applied by the operator just<br>
prior to the scan, or both. To avoid having the patient pull a gel-soaked covering 92 over<br>
her head after the scan is completed, the covering 92 could be designed to dismantle after<br>
use. The covering 92 can be equipped with a seam in the back 94 that is constructed with<br>
chain stitching that is easily undone so that the covering 92 may be removed by slipping it<br>
off the patient's arms. The shoulder seams 96 could also be made with chain stitching to<br>
further ease removal. Since a preferred embodiment of the covering 92 is designed to be a<br>
single-use item, the covering 92 could be cut off with scissors without the need for special<br>
stitching. Zippers, hook and loop, or other fasteners could also be used to ease the putting<br>
on or removal of the covering 92, and would allow the covering 92 to be re-used. A<br>
preferred embodiment uses a stretch fabric for the covering 92, but any suitable material<br>
that can conduct or pass through ultrasonic energy could be used.<br>
A nipple pad 120 is placed on the patient's nipple to provide a reference point on<br>
the images. The nipple pad 120 shows up on the scan images due to its ultrasonic<br>
characteristics that distinguish it from the breast tissue. The nipple pad 120 has the added<br>
benefit of reducing ultrasonic shadowing. Figures 12A, 12B and 12C depict a preferred<br>
embodiment of a nipple pad 120, which is made of an ultrasonically conductive material,<br>
such as a solid gel. A preferred embodiment of the nipple pad 120 is approximately 70<br>
mm in diameter and varies in thickness from less than 1 at the periphery to 4 mm at the<br>
center, but other sizes could be used. Larger and thicker gel pads are commercially<br>
available for isolated ultrasound scans, where offsetting the probe from the tissue is<br>
advantageous, but they are not designed to be completely traversed across their periphery<br>
during a scan. As shown in Figures 12A, 12B and 12C, the circular nipple pad 120 is<br>
tapered to an edge 122 about its full periphery, and has a very smooth surface. The edge<br>
122 of the nipple pad 120 is thick enough to resist tearing, yet thin enough to allow the<br>
ultrasound probe to traverse its periphery during scanning without dislodging the nipple<br>
pad 120 or causing an ultrasonic shadow at the nipple pad's edge 122. The nipple pad 120<br>
may be held in place by positioning it beneath the above-mentioned fabric covering 92.<br>
As described above, the images are reviewed in a rapid sequential fashion,<br>
imparting a sense of motion through the breast tissue. The reviewer can observe or detect<br>
a disruption of the normal breast architecture through comparative image analysis or<br>
observation. The method has advantages over other ultrasound scanning techniques,<br>
including the following:<br>
1) Parallel and contiguous images are obtained, optimizing the coverage of the<br>
breast tissue and improving the appearance of the images when viewed in a "movie-like"<br>
fashion.<br>
2) The entire breast is imaged in a uniform and reproducible manner.<br>
3) The images may be maintained and reviewed singularly, in strip form, or<br>
assembled to represent an entire breast, such as 3-D reconstruction.<br>
Accordingly, an improved ultrasonic cellular tissue screening tool is disclosed.<br>
Although embodiments and applications of this invention have been shown, it would be<br>
apparent to those skilled in the art that many more modifications are possible without<br>

at least one motor controlled by at least one microprocessor to adjust the angular<br>
position of the probe.<br>
12. The system as claimed in claim 11, optionally comprising an<br>
additional system for dynamically adjusting the angular position of the<br>
probe, including<br>
one or more displacement sensors proximate to the probe;<br>
wherein the displacement sensor(s) produces signals that are sent to the at least one<br>
microprocessor, which in turn produce signals that are sent to the at least one motor to adjust<br>
the angular position of the probe.<br>
13. The system as claimed in claim 10, wherein the at least one<br>
microprocessor determines the velocity of the probe face over the skin<br>
based on the motor speed and the probe's angular position, and sends<br>
signals to the at least one motor to maintain a uniform velocity.<br>
14. The system as claimed in claim 13, wherein the at least one<br>
microprocessor calculates the proper velocity using the following<br>
formula<br>
HV = (DV* cos(NRA) + (FL/TI * (lsin(ORA) - sin(NRA)1))<br>
Where:<br>
HV = Horizontal Velocity (of the carrier arm necessary to produce DV at the present roll<br>
angle)<br>
DV = Default Velocity (desired velocity of the probe face over the skin)<br>
FL = Fulcrum Length (distance between the roll plane pivot and the center of the probe face)<br>
TI = Time Interval (time in seconds between angle measurements)<br>
ORA = Old Roll Angle (Angle of the probe alone x-axis in last time increment)<br>
NRA = New Roll Angel (Angle of probe along x-axis as present)<br>
15. The system as claimed in claim 10, wherein the at least one<br>
microprocessor determines the lateral position of the face of the probe<br>
during the scanning process and sends signals to the at least one motor<br>
to make position corrections.<br>
16. The system as claimed in claim 15, wherein the at least one<br>
microprocessor calculates the later position corrections using the<br>
following formula<br>
YCD = (PFW * (sin(OPA) - sin(NPA))) - ½ PFW * (cos(OPA) - cos(NPA))<br>
Where:<br>
YCD = y-axis Correction Distance (of the probe to correct for the offset from the change in y-<br>
axis angle from the previous time increment)<br>
PFW = Probe Face Width (width of the probe face)<br>
OPA = Old Pitch Angle (Angle of probe along y-axis in last time increment)<br>
NPA = New Pitch Angle (Angle of probe along y-axis at present).<br>
A-system for screening breast tissue, comprising an ultrasound scanning device provided<br>
with an ultrasound probe that is capable of generating an image data representing images<br>
of cellular tissue. One or more sensors coupled with the probe to determine the probe's<br>
location. A viewer to display the image data as images, the viewer providing a rapid,<br>
sequential display of scan images. A pad to cover the patient's nipple, said pad being<br>
ultrasonically conductive and having different ultrasonic characteristics than breast tissue;<br>
and a fabric covering for the breast tissue, adapted to hold the breast tissue in place during<br>
scanning, wherein the fabric is capable of absorbing an ultrasonic coupling agent, and<br>
transmitting ultrasonic energy with minimal interference.</td>
