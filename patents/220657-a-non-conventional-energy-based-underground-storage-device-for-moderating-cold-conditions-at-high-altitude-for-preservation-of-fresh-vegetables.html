				<td>FIELD OF   INVENTION<br>
The        present     invention     relates     to        a non Convertional energy based <br><br>
underground stroge device for model rating cold condition at high attitude for <br><br>
perentation of fresh vegetable  undergroundstructure     for     moderating  extreme <br><br>
cold     conditions     at   . ,	<br><br>
high—altitude        for     applications     such     as       commercial       <br>
storage     of      fresh     vegetables      like     potattoes<br><br>
pumpkins, carrots, radish, turnip, beet root etc.<br><br>
PRIOR ART	Tubers  have been the main source of nutrition  for  the<br>
people of high altitude cold arid climates. The people residing at high altitudes remain cutoff for long<br>
durations at a stretch and therefore have no access to farm, sea and products of the temperate zone. Some of<br>
the regions of these extreme cold arid zones like Ladakh, situated at 8000 to 14000 ft above M.S.L., in<br>
India,  have to depend on stored foods during  the  cold<br>
period.  During  winter, the temperature,  in  habitable<br>
o areas  of  Ladakh drops to, as low as  {—)  30 C,  while<br>
elsewhere in Ladakh the temperature are even lower.<br>
The traditional storage of vegetables at high altitudes is generally by keeping them in a pit of suitable depth and covering them with dry earth.<br>
One  of the disadvantages of using the above  method  is that it is not feasible at commercial levels.<br><br>
Another disadvantage of the using the above method is that pit once opened has to be evacuated completely due<br>
to cold injuries causing wrinkled skin and other freeze related damage.<br>
Still another disadvantage of the using the above method is that due to the heat of fermentation getting trapped,<br>
the lower layers of vegetables get spoiled early and become unsuitable for human consumption.<br>
Yet another disadvantage of the using the above method is that only a few vegetables like potatoes, radish and<br>
carrot can be stored for a limited period (using from Dec to Feb each year).<br>
Another method of storage of tuber seed at these places is by digging a pit on a steep slope and there—after<br>
covering the seed with gravel and earth, to avoid snow, sleet and precipitation, from seeping into this space.<br>
One  of the disadvantages of the using the above  method is that the lower placed tuber mass gets crushed due  to excessive loading.<br>
Another disadvantage of the using the above method is that. to avoid the above cited drawback, number of<br>
smaller size pits are dug at regular space. The refilling these several pits during sowing season causes<br>
1abour over head.<br>
Still another method of storage of potato in high altitude areas where the duration of winter conditions<br>
is limited to 2—3 months, is that the seeds are stored in pits which are lined with dry leaves and covered<br>
with straw until they sprout.<br>
One of the disadvantage of the using th« above method is that  the seeds may not germinate in regular  order  and the  crop  thereafter may mature  at  different  periods causing hardship while harvesting.<br>
According to yet another method of storage known in the art, as per US Patent 4,423,680, involves subjecting of<br>
the organic matter to gradual decompression and cooling to freezing or sub—freezing temperature. In this method<br>
biological activity of the organic matter is suspended during storage, retaining cell structure which returns<br>
to fully normal condition on reconstitution.<br>
One of the disadvantage of using the above method is the high cost of installation of decompression apparatus.<br>
Another disadvantage of using the above method is that the adoption of the technique is difficult for the<br>
generally illiterate people residing at high altitudes like Ladakh in India.<br>
Still another disadvantage of using the above method  is that not all the tuber products return to their original shine and flavour on reconstitution.<br>
Further  disadvantage of using the above method is  that this method is not cost-effective for low valve  organic<br>
mass.<br>
Yet further disadvantage of using the above method is that the cellular structure of the tissue may require an<br>
additional process of thawing for return and regaining original appearance and consistency.<br>
OBJECTS OF PRESENT INVENTION<br>
The  primary  object  of the  present  invention  is  to provide  an  underground  structure  for  moderating  of extreme cold conditions at high altitudes for storage of fresh  vegetables  such  as  tubers,  onions,  pumpkins, carrots, radish, turnip and beet root.<br>
