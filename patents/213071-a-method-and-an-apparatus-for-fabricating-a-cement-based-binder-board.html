EXTRUDER FOR MAKING A BOARD BASED ON A..BINDER SUCH AS<br>
GYPSUM PLASTER<br>
The present invention relates to boards based on binders such as plaster, cement or other binders.<br>
In the present context, the term "board" means a thin and globally flat product whose height is small compared to the other two dimensions, whether the cross section is rectilinear or not, for example crenellated, sinusoidal, such as a corrugated sheet, or otherwise.<br>
An object of the present invention is to propose a low-cost method of producing such boards, in particular because it is executed continuously.<br>
Accordingly, a method in accordance with the invention of producing a board based on binders such as plaster, cement or other binders is characterized in that it includes the steps of:<br>
a)	mixing a composition intended to form the board body with water;<br>
b)	depositing the mixture on a moving support, which is driven continuously by a conveyor belt, said mixture passing through an extruder forming a board, said extruder being subjected to vibrations;<br>
c)	cutting the board obtained at least to length,<br>
In step c) , the board is advantageously cut to length and to width.<br>
The deposition of step b) is preferably carried out on a bottom facing; the deposit of step b) is covered with a top facing.<br>
The facing advantageously consists of a mesh and/or a web-<br>
The mesh is preferably of glass fibers.<br>
The web advantageously covers the mesh over the whole of its width; alternatively, the web is in the form of a strip and covers only the lateral edges of the mesh.<br><br>
The    web    is    preferably' a   mat,    preferably    of    glass<br>
fibers.<br>
In step c) , the cutting method is advantageously<br>
cutting with a water jet.<br>
The lateral edges of the boards are formed beforehand by turning over the bottom mesh and then cut straight; the turned over portion of the bottom mesh is covered by the top mesh whether or not it is associated with a web; alternatively, the turned over portion of the bottom mesh covers the top mesh whether or not it is associated with a web.<br>
At least the lateral edges of the bottom mesh are preferably associated with a web.<br>
When the edges are cut straight, the cutting is advantageously effected in the overlapping portion.<br>
In another embodiment, operation b) is carried out in such a way that two of the lateral edges of the boards are thinner.<br>
Alternatively the top and/or bottom facing is of cardboard, substituted for the mesh and/or the web.<br>
The invention also consists in an extruder for implementing the above method, of the kind including a transverse extrusion die, characterized in that said die is at least in part subjected to vibrations.<br>
The die advantageously has a top lip and a bottom lip which carries on its bottom face at least one vibrator; the distance between the top lip and the bottom lip of the die is adjustable.<br>
The axis of the vibrator can preferably be oriented horizontally and/or vertically.<br>
The extrusion die advantageously has a generally rectangular shape with the ends of the facing lengths converging slightly in the outward direction.<br>
The present invention also consists in a board based on a binder such as plaster or cement, characterized<br><br>
in that it is made by the above method.<br>
The present invention also consists in using the above board, in which the binder is a cementitious binder, to form or cover walls, partition walls, floors or roofs, inside or outside buildings, such as industrial kitchens, agricultare-foodstuffs laboratories, showers, bathrooms, pools or swimming pools, and/or rooms frequently washed with a water jet, such as rooms of agricultural buildings or industrial slaughterhouses, and using the above board, in which the binder is based on plaster, to form or cover walls or partition walls.<br>
The present invention will be explained in more detail with the aid of the following illustrative but nonlimiting examples, which refer to the drawings, in which:<br>
-	figure 1 is a diagram representing a method according to the invention;<br>
-	figures 2 to 4 show an extruder used in the method according to the invention, figure 2 being a view in elevation and figures 3 and 4 being views in the direction of the arrows III and IV in figure 2, respectively;<br>
-figure 5 is a view analogous to figure 3 and shows a variant;<br>
-	figure 6 is a partial sectional view of a board in accordance with the invention before cutting its longitudinal edges;<br>
-	figure 7 is a partial sectional view of a board in accordance with the invention after cutting its longitudinal edges along the line C in figure 6;<br>
-	figures 8 to 17 are diagramimatic views analogous to figure 6 each shewing one variant of a board before cutting its longitudinal edges.<br>
The binder of the board body comprises a mixture of Portland cement, sulfoaluminous clinker and a source of calcium sulfate (anhydrite, plaster or gypsum).<br><br>
- The expression "Portland cement" means a cement of type I, II, III, IV or V as standardized under European standard EN 197-1. Examples of such cements are ordinary Portland cement and any other cement with additives (composite Portland, pozzolanic, blast furnace, slag or ash cement).<br>
The above examples of cements have approximate Blaine   specific   surface   areas   from   37 00 cm^/g   to<br>
5050 cm2/g.<br>
The Portland cement content of the binder can vary from 30 to 80%. Throughout this range, it is possible to obtain quick setting formulations (setting time less than 20 minutes). A preferred range is from 50 to 70%, which yields optimum mechanical performance.<br>
The expression "sulfoaluminous clinker" means any material resulting from the curing at a temperature from 900°C to'1450°C (this process is known as "clinkerization") of mixtures containing at least one source of lime (for example limestone, which has a CaO content varying from 50% to  60%),  at  least one source of  alumina  (for example bauxites  or  other  fabrication  byproducts  containing alumina),  and at  least one source of sulfate  (gypsum, chemical gypsums, plaster, natural or synthetic anhydrite, sulfocalcic ash) . The sulfoaluminous clinker used in the present invention contains more than 30% of 4CaO.3Ai2O3.SO3 (also denoted C4A3 S ) .  The basic analyses  and the main constituents of two usable types of Sulfoaluminous clinker, characterized by respective contents of C4A3"S greater than 47%, are set out in tables I and II below:<br><br><br>
The presence of up to 10% of free lime CaO in the sulfoaluminous clinker can be tolerated without compromising the usage properties of the binder employed in the context of the present invention. This can arise for example, if the clinker is obtained by curing at relatively low temperature.<br>
The content of sulfoaluminous clinker in the binder can vary from 20% to 70%.<br>
If the Blaine specific surface area of the sulfoaluminous clinker is from 2500 cm2/g to 7000 cm2/g, and in particular from 3500 to 6500 cm2/g, the hydration<br><br>
kinetics of the binder are- not significantly modified, and achieve rapid setting and hardening.<br>
The sulfate source can be chosen at will from gypsum (or chemical gypsums), plaster, natural or synthetic anhydrite or sulfocalcic ash. The content of SO3 coming from the sulfate source can be up to 10% by mass of the total binder (which corresponds, for example, to a plaster content of up to 20% relative to the total binder) . A preferred composition is one such that the contribution of sulfate is such that the mass ratio r defined above is close to 2. It is precisely in this case that the stoichiometric conditions of formation of ettringite are complied with:<br>
C4A3S + 2 CSH0.5 + 37 H - C6AS3H32 + 2AH3<br>
This preferred composition guarantees increased durability of the boards. In fact, the absence of sulfate leads to the formation of calcium monosulfoaluminate C4ASHx that is unstable vis a vis sulfated water, for example, leading a posteriori to the formation of expansive ettringite. On the other hand, an excess of sulfate can lead to instability of thin products vis a vis moisture.<br>
If the priority is very short term mechanical strength, the preferred sulfate of the invention is plaster. If the priority is plasticity, the preferred sulfate is anhydrite.<br>
In relation to the composition of the binder with additives, the term " (super)plasticizer" must be understood to include any organic compound capable of improving the usability (or workability) of light mortar. In the case of the present invention, it can also achieve a significant water reduction, for the same workability^ and this contributes to obtaining higher mechanical performance for the production of lightweight boards-.<br>
According to the EN 934-2: 1997 standard, a water reducer additive reduces the quantity of water necessary by<br><br>
at least 5% relative to a cement composition with no additives, and a high water reducer additive reduces the quantity of water necessary by at least 12% relative to a cement composition with no additives.<br>
The (high) water reducer (super)plasticizer additives used can be alkaline (Li, Na, K) salts or alkaline earth (Ca, Mg) salts obtained from combined condensation of β-naphthalene sulfonic acid and formaldehyde (of the Cimfluid 230 or 232 type from Axim, Ciments Francais), from combined condensation of sulfonated melamine and formaldehyde (Cimfluid ML type from Axim, Ciments Frangais) or lignosulfonates.<br>
A preferred additive in the context of the present invention is the alkaline or alkaline earth salt obtained from combined condensation of sulfonated melamine and formaldehyde (Cimfluid ML type), which achieves high fluidity and causes no significant retardat ion of setting despite the high doses used.<br>
The Cimfluid ML content varies  from 0.5  to 7% (percentage by mass relative to the weight of the binder).<br>
Any mineral or organic compound that significantly extends the setting time of a mortar formulation without compromising its rheology is generally considered to constitute a setting retarder. This is known in the art. The benefit of this kind of additive lies in the possibility of controlling the setting of the formulation, and where applicable of retarding setting, to facilitate good workability. Preferred retarders are citric acid, gluconates and polyacrylates or polymethacrylates (of the Cimfluid 2 000 AC type), which also significantly improve the workability of the paste.<br>
It is obvious that the ideal formulation results from a compromise between the water content,  the  (high) water reducer (super)plasticizer content, and the retarder content, to obtain the required workability, time of use<br><br>
and mechanical performance. 'The water/binder ratio by weight used is generally from 0.2 to 0.5. Beyond this range mechanical performance falls off vertiginously. For a water/binder ratio by weight of less than 0.2, there is insufficient water for the reactions constituting hydration of the binder; surplus anhydrite binder can then remain, and can compromise the durability of the material in a damp environment. The water/binder ratio used is preferably from 0.25 to 0.40. EXAMPLES:<br>
Preparation of a board body composition according to the invention:<br>
The formulation of the base is as follows (composition 1):<br>
CPA CEM I 52. 5	60 g<br>
Sulfoaluminous clinker (1)	30 g<br>
Gypsum	10 g<br>
Additive	•	x g<br>
Total water	30 g<br>
(including that in the additives) Performance differences of the above base cement composition on varying the relative proportions x and the nature of the additives were studied, using the compositions of examples 1, 5, 7, 10 and 12 described below.<br>
The following measurements are effected on the above compositions:<br>
- Measurement of time of use: The procedure consists in tracking the rheological behavior of the composition as a function of time when undergoing continuous mixing at an imposed speed of 300 rpm. The time of use is then defined as the time at which the measured resisting torque is equal to 0.05 N.m. The calculated parameter Atj corresponds to the time necessary for the measured resisting torque to increase from 0.05 N.m to<br><br>
0.1 N.m. It takes account of 'the rate of hardening of the coinposition: the shorter this time, the higher the rate of hardening .<br>
-	Measurement of initial spreading: The procedure consists in effecting a rheological measureinent 1 minute 20 seconds after mixing using a Smidth ring with the following dimensions: inside diameter = 60 mm, height = 50 mm. The paste is mixed for 40 seconds at 250 rpm and the spreading measurement is effected after 1 minute 20 seconds.<br>
-	Measurement of      setting      time:     -The  procedure<br>
adopted consists in measuring, as a function of time, the<br>
resistance to the penetration of a cylindrical needle with<br>
a diameter of 3 mm into the formulation under test using<br>
the TA XT2 texture meter from Societe Rheo. The rate and<br>
distance of penetration are respectively fixed at 2 mm/s<br>
and 10 mm depth.  The measured start and end of setting<br>
times respectively correspond to the times necessary to<br>
obtain a   force of 10 N and of 50 N at a depth of 10 mm. In<br>
contrast  to  the measurement  of  the  time  of  use,  the<br>
measurement of the setting time is effected at rest without<br>
disturbing the sample during setting by mixing it.  The<br>
calculated parameter Δt1 corresponds to the time necessary<br>
for the measured force to increase from 10 N to 50 N. It<br>
takes account of the rate of hardening of the composition:<br>
the shorter this time, the higher the rate of hardening.<br>
The various compositions studied are described below:<br>
EXAMPLE 1:<br>
This composition contains only the base formulation and the Cimfluid ML superplasticizer:<br><br><br>
A value of 60 mm corresponds to a zero spread (the diameter of the cone used for the measurement).<br>
The Cimf luid ML superplasticizer used on its own yields satisfactory results.<br>
The  following  examples  2  to  6  also  used  the Cimfluid ML superplasticizer on its own.<br>
EXAMPLE 2: Comparison of two uses of a su1foaluminous clinker with different contents of calcium sulfoaluminate C4A3S .<br><br>
The  start  of  setting  times  measured  for  the compositions 2a and 2b are 6 minutes and 7 minutes 50 seconds, respectively. The composition 2a has a ratio r equal to 2.48. EXAMPLE 3: This example shows the effects on the start and<br><br>
end of setting times of the Portland cement content of the binder, with a plaster content maintained constant and equal to 10%, the remainder to 100% being sulf oaluminous clinker. These tests are carried out in the presence of 2% Cimfluid ML and in the absence of lightweight aggregates, the water/binder mass ratio being 0.30.<br>
The following table shows that for Portland cement contents from 36 to 7 6% the start of setting time is 10<br><br>
2 g of expanded polystyrene balls were added to composition 2a of example 2.<br>
The measurements of setting times and of mechanical resistance to flexing (Rf) and compression (Rc) were carried out on (4 x 4 x 16) cm3 samples with a specific gravity equal to 1, after 20 minutes, 50 minutes and 2 4<br><br><br>
EXAMPLE 5:<br>
Mechanical   resistance   to   flexing   (Rf)   and<br>
compression (Re) were measured on (4 x 4 x 16) cm3 samples<br>
after 24 hours With a formulation identical to that of<br>
example 4, but with the Portland cement content varying.<br><br>
EXAMPLE  5:  Use  of  Portland  cement  and  sulfoaluminous clinker with different Blaine specific surface areas.<br>
The formulation studied in all cases is the previous composition 2a to which polystyrene balls were added to obtain a specific gravity very close to 1. The influence  of  the Blaine  specific  surface  area  of  the<br><br><br><br>
(**):     the specific surface area  of the  sulfoaluminous clinker used is equal to 3720 cm2/.g<br>
In the specific surface area range studied (3500-5500 cm2/g), whether in the case of sulfoaluminous clinker or Portland cement, the hydration kinetics of the composition 2a are not significantly modified, as indicated by the similar mechanical performance obtained. EXAMPLE 7<br>
The two additives, i.e. the superplasticizer (Cimfluid ML) and the poly(meth)acrylate retarder (Cimfluid AC) are used simultaneously in the cement base composition at contents set out in the table below:<br><br>
*ML  =  Cimfluid ML,    *AC  = Cimfluid 2000 AC<br>
The use of 2% of Cimfluid ML obtains a rapid setting and rapid hardening cement formulation usable in the context of fabrication of thin lightweight cement-based products.<br><br>
The use -of Cimfluid 20OO AC, at contents of up to<br>
1v. in this example, controls the time of use of the basic<br>
composition (containing 2% of Cimfluid ML), which can be up<br>
to  approximately  30  minutes.  Moreover,  this  addition<br>
increases  the  initial  workability  of  the  composition<br>
without  significantly modifying  the  start  and  end  of<br>
setting times. The values of Δt1 . and Δt2 show that, even<br>
with l% of Cimfluid 2000 AC, the rate of hardening is only<br>
slightly lower.<br>
EXAMPLE 8:<br>
With  a  formulation  identical  to  that  of  the<br>
composition of example 4, with a content of polymelamine<br>
sulfonate equal to 2%, and adding 1% of poly(meth)acrylate,<br>
the resistance to flexing  (Rf)  was measured at  1 hour<br>
30 minutes and 24 hours directly on thin boards fabricated<br>
in  accordance  with  the  invention,  with  dimensions<br>
L = 100 "mm,  1 = 75 mm,  e = 12.5 mm,  from compositions in<br>
which only the content of Portland cement varies. Expanded<br>
polystyrene balls with a particle size range 
added to the binder at the rate of 2% by mass. The results<br><br>
As can be seen,  the resistances to flexing are significant from as little as 1 hour 30 minutes. EXAMPLES 9 and 9a:<br>
These examples compare the mechanical performance in compression (Rc) and flexing (Rf) of two compositions 9a and 9 respectively prepared in the presence and in the absence of LiaCO3.<br><br>
The formulations are as follows:<br>
. binder (100%)<br>
sulfoaluminous clinker 1	45%<br>
Portland cement CEM I 52.5	40%<br>
Plaster	15%<br>
. additives (% relative to binder)<br>
-	Cimfluid ML	1.5%<br>
-	Cimfluid AC 2000	0.3%<br>
-	polystyrene balls (
-	Li2C03	0% (ex. 9)<br>
0.5% (ex. 9a) . water 30% relative to binder The  performance  obtained  is  set  out  in  the<br><br>
Polymelamine sulfonate (Cimfluid ML) at a rate of 2% and citric acid at varying rates were added to the cement base composition. The results obtained are set out below:<br><br><br>
*ML   =   Ciinfluid ML<br>
The use of citric acid increases the time of use of the composition. EXAMPLE 11:<br>
In the composition of example 1, the poly(meth)acrylate was replaced by an additive containing a gluconate  (Cimaxtard 101,  from Axim),  in the  following<br><br>
The use of Cimaxtard 101 increases the time of use of  the  composition  without  compromising  the  initial rheology. EXAMPLE 12:<br>
Poly(meth)acrylate (Cimfluid AC) alone was added to the cement base composition, in the proportions indicated below:<br><br><br>
The use of Cimfluid 2000 AC on its own also extends the time of use of the composition, up to approximately 30 minutes. However, note that in the situation where it is possible to obtain a time of use of 28.6 minutes, the value of Δt J is higher than that measured with the mixture [ML (2%) - AC (1%)] (see example 7).<br>
Figure 1 is a diagram illustrating one fabrication method.<br>
A first metered piremixture 10 is produced from cement 11, clinker 12, plaster 13 and aggregates 14 such as polystyrene balls.<br>
A second metered premixture 20 is produced from a plasticizer 21 and a retarder 23 to both of which water 22 has been added.<br>
The premixtures 10 and 20 are introduced into a mixer 30; the resulting mixture is taken up by an uptake pump 31 and distributed via a distributor 32 to the entry of an extruder 33; distribution is effected, homogeneously in the transverse direction, between top and bottom facings consisting of sheets in the form of meshes, namely a bottom mesh Gl and a top mesh G2; the bottom mesh Gl rests on a plastics material sheet FP, such as a polyethylene sheet, pulled by a downstream conveyor belt 43 (figures 2 and 3) and sliding on a table 46 disposed on the upstream side of the extruder 33; at the exit from the extruder 33, the<br><br>
board formed to shape in this way is fed to a cutting station 34 where its length and its edges, and thus its width, are cut, advantageously by a water jet.<br>
During the above process, each facing consists of a mesh Gl, G2 and/or a web V, VB; the web V covers the mesh Gl, G2 over the whole of its width; the web VB is in strip form and covers only the lateral edges of the mesh G2; the lateral edges of the boards are preferably formed by turning over the bottom mesh Gl- and then cut straight; the turned over portion of the bottom mesh Gl is covered by the top mesh G2, whether or not associated with a web V; the turned over portion of the bottom mesh Gl covers the top mesh G2, whether or not associated with a web V; the lateral edges of the bottom mesh Gl are associated with a web V, VB.<br>
The cutting is advantageously effected in the overlapping portion.<br>
Part of the extruder 33 is shown diagrammatically in figures 2 to 4 . It essentially consists of a table 35 elastically mounted on a frame 36 by means of springs 37, here four coil springs disposed at the four corners of the generally rectangular table 35. The top 38 of the table 35 constitutes the bottom lip of a die 40 disposed transversely and of globally rectangular section, the top lip 39 of which is shown; here the top lip 39 is in the form of a blade and its height is adjustable relative to the bottom lip 38 so that the height of the die 40, and therefore the required thickness of the board, can be adjusted.<br>
A slightly inclined deflector 41 at the entry of the die 40 guides the material toward the die.<br>
The bottom of the table 35 carries at least one vibrator 42, here two vibrators 42. A vibrator 42 consists of an electric motor whose rotor has an adjustable imbalance adapted to produce vibrations, for example.<br><br>
A continuous board pulled by the conveyor belt 43 is obtained at the exit from the extruder 33, as shown by the arrow F in figures 2 and 3.<br>
Here the axes of the vibrators 42 are parallel to the arrow F; this axis can be oriented in a horizontal plane, .is shown in figure 5, in which another orientation of the vibrators 42 is shown in chain-dotted outline; it can equally be oriented in a vertical plane, for example the plane of figure 2; these orientations favorably influence the homogeneity of the composition in the transverse direction on entering the extruder 33.<br>
Here the die 44 is generally rectangular with the ends 44 slightly converging in the outward direction so that the parallel lateral edges of the resulting board are thinner, as defined in French standard NF P72-302: this facilitates the application of a mastic for jointing two boards side by side, but is not mandatory, of course.<br>
The boards are removed from the conveyor after the operation of distributing the mixture and cutting; the composition according to the invention, the speed of the conveyor belt and the length of the system are such that, at this point, the hydration of the boards is such that each board can be handled.<br>
Boards according to the present invention can have a body of highly varied composition.<br>
The body can be based on semihydrate calcium sulfate and water, for example as described in the document GB-A-2 0553 779; conventional additives can be used, as well as from 0.3 to 3% of glass fibers; the body can also include perlite, vermiculite, a formaldehyde-based or other resin".<br>
The examples described in the document WO-A-91/11321 are also suitable; more generally, here, boards are obtained by mixing lightweight components, such as expanded clays, expanded blast furnace ash,  expanded<br><br>
schist, perlite, expanded polystyrene balls, expanded glass balls, with a hydraulic binder such as Portland cement, cement based on magnesium, aluminous cement, gypsum and/or mixtures of some of the above, with or without foaming agents.<br>
To be more precise, good results can be obtained with the following examples.<br><br><br>
EXAMPLE 14<br>
This composition is of the kind described in the<br>
document WO 99/14449.<br><br><br><br>
to the invention before its edges are cut; there can be seen therein the bottom mesh Gl, the top mesh G2, the thinner edge 44 and the aggregates 14; here, to form the edges of the board, the bottom mesh Gl is folded laterally so that it partially overlaps laterally the top mesh G2.<br>
Note that, in the lower portion of the board, as seen in the figure, a thin region D is free of aggregates 14; this is therefore a densified region, obtained by virtue of the nature of the composition of the ■ board body and extrusion with vibration; this region increases the mechanical strength of the board.<br>
As an alternative, the densified region is an applied deposit consisting of a layer free of aggregates.<br>
Figure 7 shows the board after cutting the edge 45<br><br>
along the line C in figure 6.<br>
The parallel lateral edges are straight.<br>
Here also, as shown in figure 9, the top mesh G2 can carry, for example have bonded to it, a web V consisting of a glass fiber mat, for example; this kind of web V further increases the mechanical strength of the board; here the web V covers the mesh G2 over the whole of its width.<br>
Other dispositions can be adopted, of course.<br>
Thus, as shown in figure 8, the mesh G2 associated with a web V covers the laterally folded portion of the bottom mesh G1. Figure 10 is analogous to figure 2 except that the bottom mesh Gl is associated with a strip of web VB attached, for example adhesively bonded, along its longitudinal edges so that the top mesh G2, where applicable associated with a web V, covers the folded part of the strip of web VB, which helps to form the edge of the board. Figure 11 combines the features described with reference to figures 9 and 10, in other words it is the bottom mesh Gl and the strip of web VB that cover the top mesh G2 and its web V. Of course, the bottom mesh Gl could equally carry a web, such as the web V; accordingly, figures 12-15 illustrate situations in which the bottom mesh Gl carries a web V, the remainder being as in figures 8, 9 with a top mesh G2 with no web, figures 12-13, or with a web V, figures 14-15; the mesh Gl is covered by the web V over the whole of its width. Figures 16, 17 show a disposition analogous to that of figures 12, 13, in which the web V associated with the bottom mesh Gl has been replaced by a lateral strip of web VB.<br>
The web" VB in the form of a strip covers only the lateral edges of the mesh Gl and/or G2; accordingly, the top mesh G2 at least partly covers a portion of the bottom mesh Gl, whether associated or not with a web V, VB; alternatively, the top mesh G2 is at least partly covered<br><br>
by a portion of the mesh Gl, whether associated or not with a web V, VB.<br>
Alternatively, the top lip 39 is the bottom generatrix of a cylindrical roller mounted to rotate about a transverse axis.<br>
In a variant that is not shown, the top and/or bottom facing is of cardboard, substituted for the mesh and/or the web.<br>
A layer of latex type polymer emulsion (or one with organic solvent) is advantageously deposited on one or both faces of the board; thus a protective film is obtained on the surface of the board. The protective film in particular reduces the permeability of the board, improves the surface appearance, facilitates the adhesion of any covering, such as tiles, and to some degree limits dimensional variations of the board. The protective film can be deposited by surface. spraying, by coating with rollers, by impregnating the mesh or meshes, whether or not associated with a web, by passage through a bath or by passage between rollers.<br><br><br><br>
