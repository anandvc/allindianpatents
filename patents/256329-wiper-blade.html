R 309109 Wiper Blade<br>
State-of-the-art of Technology<br>
The Invention relates to a wiper blade in accordance with the generic description of Claim 1.<br>
From the Patent Document DE 10 13 680 A1, a non-articulated wiper blade is known whose wiper frame is made of an elastomer material and which has on its upper side a spoiler. The spoiler can be directly formed and be of the same material as in the case of the wiper frame, or can be a separate component made of a suitable other plastic material. The spoiler can function as the carrying element of the wiper blade either alone or together with spring switch blades, provided in the longitudinal grooves on the sides of the profile of the wiper frame. At the ends of the wiper blade, caps are provided whose tail surface run in the longitudinal direction of the wiper blade and join themselves with a slight recess with the tail surface of the spoiler. Through the tail surface of the spoiler and the end caps, the wind presses the wiper blade with increasing speed of the vehicle, far more against the wind screen of the vehicle if it impacts the wiper blade primarily across the longitudinal direction. In the central area of the wiper blade, in a section of the spoiler, a connection or jointing device is fixed in accordance with the so called "side lock system" on the load carrying element, in which the wiper arm in the area of the jointing device runs sideways parallel to the wiper blade. Also known is a so called "Over Lock System" in which the wiper arm in the area of the jointing device runs upper-half of the wiper blade. The jointing device has on its sides respectively two claws which hold the spring switch blade of the load carrying element by enveloping them sideways.<br><br>
From the patent document DE 100 25 710 A1, a so called non-articulated wiper blade is known which has a rubber-elastic wiper frame with a wiper frame with a wiper lip. Between the wiper lip and a head-liner longitudinal side grooves are planned in which spring switch blades are incorporated as load carrying elements. These are held together through bridge elements at their ends and a central jointing element. The bridging elements have a formed prolongation as fixing device, which at its free end has at least one protrusion/jut directed towards the head-liner. During the assembly, the prolongation is bent against the head liner such that the protrusion grips in the head liner and fixes the spring switch blades in longitudinal direction relative to the wiper blade. The bridging elements are covered finally with end caps.<br>
Advantages of the Invention:<br>
In accordance with the invention, the end caps of the wiper blade have detachable fixing devices, which grip the head-liner of a wiper frame, whereby the axial displacement of the spring switch blades of the wiper blade relative to the wiper frame is restricted through the end caps. The spring switch blades are not directly fixed on the wiper frame but indirectly through the end cap. After the end caps are detached during the disassembly, the wiper frame can be replaced in a simple manner even by a layman or non-professional. If in the process inadvertently the fixing devices are damaged, the inexpensive end cap can be replaced. The expensive spring points are always reusable.<br>
In one of the designs of the invention, the end cap primarily consists of a basic part and a lid which can be rotated. For assembly purposes, first the basic part is inserted with open lid at the end of the wiper frame till the formed lock-in clamps catch the bridge held together by one of the two side spring points in the side opposite to the end of the wiper frame. In this position, the basic part is fixed at the end and  in the  longitudinal direction  of the spring  point.     In a second<br><br>
assembly step, the lid is tilted in its locking position, by which it closes an opening of the basic part completely, as a result of which the end cap gets an aerodynamically advantageous form, and covers fully the end of the wiper blade.<br>
The lid has on its inner side a cam which presses during the closing movement on a spring contact stud, positioned in the area of the opening on the basic part parallel to a head-liner of the wiper frame. The cams are so designed that they exceed during the closing movement a maximum limit, so that the lid cannot open itself automatically. Through the cam form, the actuation force in relation to the press force can be transmitted. The spring tongue (spring contact stud) has on the side opposite to the head-liner a formed latching mandrel, which is pressed to the head-liner in the closed position. In the closed position of the iid the spring points are fixed then through the tips of the latching mandrel gripping the rubber elastic surface of the head-liner in longitudinal direction relative to the wiper frame, so that the spring points are now fixed through the end caps to the wiper frame. Furthermore, in the closed position the lock-in clamps/claws catching the bridge are latched (through cheeks) to the inner side of the lid such that the end cap does not get detached from the wiper blade end involuntarily.<br>
The dismantling of the end caps is very simple. For this purpose, only the lid is tilted from the closed position, that is, to such an extent that the spring tongue lowers itself and the latching mandrel gets released from its grip. Simultaneously in this position, the latching of the lock-in nose is released so that the basic part of the end cap can be pushed from the end of the wiper blade. In this condition, a worn out wiper frame can be removed and replaced through a new one. Because, for the purpose of reestablishing the wiper quality only the worn-out wiper frame is replaced; but the spoiler, the spring points and the end caps are again re-used, costs for the consumables are significantly lower than for replacement of an entire wiper blade. Moreover, lesser waste products accrue as a result of which the environment remains protected.<br><br>
In order to simplify the dismantling and to be able to access/hold in grip the lid better, especially if it is difficult to be tilted because of deposits of dirt and other environmental influences, it has several grip grooves. Moreover, the spring tongue possesses on the side facing its head-liner, a dismantling wedge located at the centre, which through its form supports during the withdrawal end-cap the lowering/lifting of the spring tongue at the time of extracting the end cap.<br>
The basic part and the lid are preferably made of plastic and are manufactured in large numbers price competitively in an injection moulding process. The moulded lid has, besides differently shaped locking devices, an open cam on the face side. Also the basic part possesses after the moulding the final external shape and has in the opening the spring tongue with the latching mandrel as well as an axis for seating of the iid. This axis is flattened that is in such a manner that the open cam 1 can be mounted only in the open position of the lid, and gets latched during tilting in the locking position.<br>
In yet another design of the invention, the latching mandrel gripping the head-liner is formed on a cylindrical stopping device. This is screw-fixed, after inserting the basic part on the wiper blade end, in an opening for seating in the basic part. For this purpose, the stopping devices have on their circumference a vertical threading created usefully through groove-formed recesses. Counter pieces, such as tappets or cogs located on the wall of the seating opening, grip these grooves. For the purpose of fixing with the use of a screw-driver the stop devices have on their face surface a slit. In assembled condition, the latching mandrel with its tip grips in the head liner, and lies simultaneously with the jacket or the lateral surface on the side of the bridge opposite to the end of the wiper blade because of which also in this design version the wiper frame, the spring points, and the end caps are fixed. In order to prevent an involuntary disengagement of the stopping device, it is mounted under a minimal tension. For this purpose, groove-formed recesses of the vertical threading are provided<br><br>
in a jacket, which surrounds the latching mandrel with a gap and has a longitudinal slit. During insertion of the stopping device in the seating opening, and threading of the cogs in the groove-type recesses, the jacket is marginally pressed on its circumference and abuts its inner surface with a pre-stress.<br>
Drawing<br>
Further advantages emerge from the following description of the drawings.<br>

Description of the Design Examples:<br>
Only the parts of a non-articulated wiper blade 10 of a wind shield wiper are illustrated to the extent they are essential for the understanding of the invention (figure 1). The wiper blade 10 has a wiper frame 12 made of an elastomer material, whose bottom side facing the un-illustrated vehicle wind shields, is designed as wiper lip 14. The wiper blade 10 has upper-half of the wiper frame 12 a spoiler 24. At the ends of the wiper blade 10, end caps 26 are provided whose tail surfaces run longitudinally to the wiper blade 10 and join with a marginal recess at the tail surface of the spoiler 24, such that the wiper blade 10 in this condition possesses an aerodynamically advantageous shape.<br>
The end cap 26 is designed as a two part component and consists of, in an initial design, a basic part 28 and a lid 30, which in mounted condition assumes the position of a closure (figure 1). With open lid 30, the basic part 28 can be withdrawn from the end of the wiper frame 12 so that in case of bad wiping quality the worn out wiper frame 12 can be replaced (figure 3). To facilitate simpler assembly, grip-grooves 56 are planned on the outer side of the lid 30. The wiper frame 12 has two spring points 18 and 20 made of spring steel as supporting structure, located in longitudinal side grooves between the wiper lip 14 and a head liner 16. In the central area, the spoiler 24 includes the spring points 18 and 20, while they are held together at the ends by a bridge 22, which is fastened at its sides to the spring points 18, 20. During replacement, the worn out wiper frame 12 is withdrawn from the spring points 18, 20 and replaced with a new one.<br>
Thereafter, the basic part 28 with open lid 30 is inserted to the end of the wiper blade 12 till the locking hooks 44 with their clamping noses 46 get locked to the side of the bridge 22 opposite to the end of the wiper blade 10. Now, the basic part 28 is fixed in longitudinal direction at the end of the spring points 18, 20. For simpler threading and as support on the spring points 18 and 20, the basic part<br><br>
28 has on its bottom side a guidance profile 42 (figure 5). In a second assembly step, the lid 30 is tilted in its closed position. The lid 30 has on its inner side two ribs 38 which in an end area are designed as cams/tappets and thereby during the tilting movement with increasing pressure they act on a spring tongue 50 of the basic part. In order to enable a symmetrical pressure on the spring tongue 50, and thus to exclude a twisting, between the ribs 38 an axial intermediate space is provided in which a guide/pilot rod 48 formed on the spring tongue 50 grips.<br>
On the side facing the headliner 16 the spring tongue 50 has a latching mandrel 52, the tip of which is pressed, during closing of the lid 30, to the elastic surface of the head liner 16, so that this remains fixed through the end cap 26 relative to the spring points 18 and 20. Additionally two cheeks 54 formed on the sides of the spring tongue 50 latch the locking hooks 44. These support the latching mandrel 52 and cannot loosen themselves when the lid is closed. At the centre of the locking nose 46 and in the area of the bridge 22 opposite to the end of the wiper blade 10 a disassembly wedge 58 is provided on the spring tongue 50. As the height of the dismantling wedge 58 tapers at the end of the wiper blade 10, it helps in the withdrawing or lifting of the spring tongue 50, if the basic part is withdrawn from the end of the wiper blade 10.<br>
The basic part 28 and the lid 30 are preferably made of plastic. They are produced as single components in an injection moulding process and thereafter assembled as end cap. 26 (fig.4). For this purpose the lid has on its face side an open cam 34, which is jointed to an axis 36 of the basic part 28. The axis 36 is arranged in an opening 32 above the spring tongue 50 and is functioning as the spin axis for the tilting of the lid 30. Advantageously the axis 36 is flattened, so that the open cam 34 can be mounted only in a position which is corresponding to an open lid 30 and is latched in the locking position.<br><br>
The design as per Fig 6 to Fig 10 shows a end cap 60 which is made of a basic part 62 with a screwed-in stopping plug 66 (fig. 6). In the assembled state the lid 60 covers the end of the wiper blade 10 and envelops itself with a connection profile 80 in a harmonious and aerodynamically-advantageous manner with the spoiler 24. The screwed-in stopping plug 66 is in the closing position. It possesses at the circumference a vertical threading 70 (fig. 7), formed of groove-type recesses, in which two tappets 102, provided on the wall of a seating opening 64, lock-in. For the detaching with a screw driver a slit 68 is made use of; this is located on an outer face surface 72 of the stopping plug 66. The groove-type recesses of the vertical threading 70 are planned in a jacket 74, which surrounds a central core 78 at/with a gap and has a longitudinal slit 76 (fig. 7). The jacket 74 is slightly squeezed at the circumference in order to insert the stopping plug 66 in the seating opening 64 as well as to thread-up the tappets 102 into the groove-type recesses 70.<br>
To fix the head-liner 16 relative to the end cap 60, the core 78 of the stopping plug has a latching mandrel 52, which is located on the front-side facing the head-liner 16. In the assembled state when the basic part 82 with the face side of the connecting profile 80 is adjacent to the spoiler 24, and the stopping device 66 is screwed into the seating opening 64, the tip of the latching mandrel 52 grips in the head-liner 16 (fig. 9). Moreover the lateral surface of the latching mandrel 52 is close to the bridge 22 and fixes the end cap 60 at the end of the wiper frame relative to it and to the spring points 18, 20 (fig. 10).<br>
One end cap 81 shows an additional variant to the end cap 26, which has a basic part 82 and a lid 84 (fig. 11). In order to loosen/detach the end cap 81, the lid 84 is tilted approx. 45° out of the basic part 82 (fig.12). With that a locking jut 98 unlocks itself (fig. 15) from the locking-depth 96 (fig. 12) and releases the locking/latching of the lid 84. Moreover the latching mandrel 52 is disengaged, so that the wiper frame 12 is not fixed anymore and can be changed after disassembling the end cap 81.<br><br>
For a new assembly, first the basic part 82 is, guided from the guidance profile 94, is inserted into the end of the wiper blade 10 till a lock-in hook 90 latches with a lock-in nose 92 (fig. 16) behind the bridge 22 of the spring points 18 and 20 (fig. 14). In a second assembly step, the lid 84 is closed, whereby it pushes/presses with the inner-side through a bearing surface 100 on the lock-in hook 90 with the lock-in nose 92 and latches the lock-in hooks 90. The end cap 81 is now fixed at the end of the wiper blade on one hand relative to it through the latching mandrel 52, which is gripping with its tip into the elastic surface of the head-liner 16 and on the other hand through the lock-in hook 90 relative to the spring points 18, 20.<br>
The basic part 82 and the lid 84 are connected in a tilt-able way. For that the basic part 82 has as spin axis two flattened bearing necks 88 provided on the side of bearing surface 100, so that the open cam 86 can be assembled only in an open position of the lid 84, and is locked in the closing position of the lid 84.<br>
