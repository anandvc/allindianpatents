Composition and Process for Enhancing Bio-Mass Production in Greenhouses.<br>
The instant invention relates to a thermoplastic polymer composition useful in greenhouse<br>
films to enhance plant growth or in general bio-rnass production. Further aspects of the invention are a process for enhancing plant growth in greenhouses by incorporating a photoactive additive together with light stabilizers into the greenhouse film and the use of the condensation product of dialkylamino benzaldehyde and barbituric acid together with light stabilizers as a plant growth enhancing additive in polymeric greenhouse films.<br>
It is well known in the art that some types of crops are degraded by the UV-components of solar radiation, which must be filtered off to obtain high quality and productivity of the crops. Additionally, some microorganisms, e.g. Botrytis Cinerea, as well as some harmful insects, e.g. white flies, aphides, thrips or leafminers, can proliferate under specific UV-irradiation. These pests can be significantly reduced when UV light does not or to less extent reach the plants. [R Reuveni et al, Development of photoselective PE films for control of foliar pathogens in greenhouse-grown crops, Plasticulture No, 102, p. 7 (1994); Y. Antignus et aL, The use of UV absorbing plastic sheets to protect crops against insects and spread of virus diseases, CIPA Congress March 1997, pp,23'33\. On the other hand, bee activity, requiring a certain band of UV radiation, needs to be retained in greenhouses in order to ensure fructification on flowering plants, e.g. tomato, cucumber, pumpkin etc.<br>
Plant growth is regulated by photosynthesis, photomorphogenesis and the photoperiodicity. All these processes require light and contribute in a unique way to the plant development. If the spectrum of the outside solar radiation can be significantly modified by the optical properties of the agricultural film covering a greenhouse, a change in plant growth may occur. Changes in the radiation transmitted by the agricultural film induce photo-synthetic and photo-morphogenic effects and can result in modifications of the architecture and shape of the plants with significant consequence on the value of the crop.<br>
The condensation product of dialkylamino benzaldehyde and barbituric acid enhances plant growth in greenhouses, when incorporated into the thermoplastic polymer film covering the greenhouse. A part of the near UV light is filtered out by this condensation product and transformed into fluorescent light of substantially longer wavelength, which is believed to be responsible for the faster growth of many plants.<br><br>
This condensation product alone is photochemical not sufficiently stable to ensure the desired effect for a certain time. It has now been surprisingly found that the combined use of the condensation product with a UV-absorber or/and with a sterically hindered amine significantly prolongs the lifetime of the polymer film. The fluorescence of the condensation product remains high and the plant growth effect is retained over a long time. Although the UV-absorber filters off UV light from the fluorescing condensation product, the fluorescence yield of the latter remains high enough to ensure the desired plant growth effect. The condensation product itself is colored absorbing mainly in the near UV range, whereas the Stokes shift of the fluorescence light is large, emitting light of reddish color. This fluorescence increases the light transmitted in the red region of the visible light spectrum (maximum emission approximately at 635 nm) with significant effects on crop's yield and quality, such as stem's length, thickness and growing cycle.<br>
The product is very good compatible with a variety of polymers and with other frequently used additives.<br>

Examples are tlie oxides of zinc, aluminum, calcium or magnesium, or the hydroxides of zinc, aluminum or calcium, in particular zinc oxide (ZnO), zinc hydroxide (Zn(0)2), ortho or meta aluminum (AI(0H)3), alpha or gamma-aluminum oxide (AI2O3), or magnesium oxide (MgO), Special preference is given to ZnO, Zn(OH)2 or MgO. Metal carboxylates may optionally also be added. These are mainly salts of Al, Ba, Mg, Sr or Zn. Preferred are salts of aluminum, calcium, magnesium or zinc, especially of C12-C18 carboxylic acids. Preferred are calcium salts, for example calcium stearate. Hydrocalcites are in general preferred.<br>
The commercial stericaily hindered amines given above are partially blends with UV-absorbers (THT series) or contain further processing additives, such as ZnO, MgO, Ca-stearate, Zn-stearate.<br><br>
The reaction and the products are known and have the following CAS numbers: (I) is No. 1753-47-5 and (I!) is No. 152734-34-4. The condensation reaction is typically carried out in a solvent, such as for example ethanol. Depending on the amount of additional NH4OH the formation of product (I) or (II) is favored. The condensation temperature range is typically from 30° C to 100° C. The condensation is usually carried out at atmospheric pressure.<br><br>
Preferably R101 and R102 are methyl.<br>
The polymeric composition is for example in the form of a film used in agricultural applications. It may be a self-supporting film construction or a film may be laminated onto, for example, glass or polycarbonate. When used in agricultural applications the film is preferably used for greenhouses, as mulch film or small tunnel cover. The film can form the cover of a greenhouse, protecting the plants from the influences of the surrounding or the film can be used in the inside of a greenhouse to cover or protect the plants or a part of the plants from influences originating from inside, such as artificial watering or spraY1ng of herbicides and/or insecticides.<br>
Preferably the condensation product is present in an amount of from 0.005% to 10%, more preferably of from 0.05% to 4% and most preferably of from 0.1% to 2.5% by weight based on the weight of the thermoplastic polymer.<br>
The thermoplastic polymer film is preferably transparent. Transparent means in the coNT6xt of the present invention that more than 50%, preferably more than 70% of the incident radiation in the visible range between 400 and 720 nm pass through the polymer film. This is, for example, measured by measuring the total incident radiation (directional and diffuse) and the total transmitted radiation behind the film (directional and diffuse).<br>
The level of transparency necessary for an optimum plant growth depends on the latitude. For example, near the equator less transparency is desirable than in the temperate zone.<br>

The nature and amount of the further additives added are determined by the nature of the<br><br>
substrate to be stabilized and its iNT6nded use; in many cases from 0.1 to 5% by weight is used, based on the polymer to be stabilized.<br>
The additives of the invention and optional further components may be added to the polymer material individually or mixed with one another. If desired, the individual components can be mixed with one another before incorporation into the polymer for example by dry blending, compaction or in the melt.<br>
The incorporation of the additive of the invention and optional further components into the polymer is carried out by known methods such as dry blending in the form of a powder, or wet mixing in the form of solutions, dispersions or suspensions for example in an inert solvent, water or oil. The additive of the invention and optional further additives may be incorporated, for example, before or after molding or also by applY1ng the dissolved or dispersed additve or additive mixture to the polymer material, with or without subsequent evaporation of the solvent or the suspension/dispersion agent. They may be added directly into the processing apparatus (e.g. extruders, iNT6rnal mixers, etc), e.g. as a dry mixture or powder or as solution or dispersion or suspension or melt.<br>
The incorporation can be carried out in any beatable container equipped with a stirrer, e.g. in a closed apparatus such as a kneader, mixer or stirred vessel. The incorporation is preferably carried out in an extruder or in a kneader. It is immaterial whether processing takes place in an inert atmosphere or in the presence of oxygen.<br>
The addition of the additive or additive blend to the polymer can be carried out in all customary mixing machines in which the polymer is melted and mixed with the additives. Suitable machines are known to those skilled in the art. They are predominantly mixers, kneaders and extruders.<br>
The process is preferably carried out in an extruder by introducing the additive during processing.<br>
Particularly preferred processing machines are single-screw extruders, contrarotating and corotating twin-screw extruders, planetary-gear extruders, ring extruders or cokneaders. It is also possible to use processing machines provided with at least one gas removal compartment to which a vacuum can be applied.<br><br>
Suitable extruders and kneaders are described, for example, in Handbuch der Kunststoffex-'rusion, Vol. 1 Grundlagen, Editors F. Hensen, W. Knappe, H. PoteNT6, 1989, pp, 3-7, ^SBN:3-446'14339-4 (Vol. 2 Extrusionsanlagen 1986, ISBN 3-446-14329-7).<br>
'OX example, the screw length is 1 - 60 screw diameters, preferably 35-48 screw diameters. The rotational speed of the screw is preferably 10 - 600 rotations per minute (rpm), very Darticularly preferably 25 - 300 rpm.<br>
The maximum throughput is dependent on the screw diameter, the rotational speed and the driving force.<br>
If a plurality of components are added, these can be premixed or added individually. The additive of the invention and optional further additives can also be sprayed onto the polymer material. They are able to dilute other additives (for example the conventional additives indicated above) or their melts so that they can be sprayed also together with these additives onto the material. Addition by spraY1ng during the deactivation of the polymerization catalysts is particularly advantageous; in this case, the steam evolved may be used for deactivation of the catalyst. In the case of spherically polymerized polyolefins it may, for example, be advantageous to apply the additives of the invention, optionally together with other additives, by spraY1ng.<br>
The additives of the invention and optional further additives can also be added to the polymer in the form of a masterbatch ("concentrate") which contains the components in a concentration of, for example, about 1 % to about 40% and preferably 2 % to about 20 % by weight incorporated in a polymer. The polymer must not be necessarily of identical structure than the polymer where the additives are added finally. In such operations, the polymer can be used in the form of powder, granules, solutions, suspensions or in the form of latices.<br>
Incorporation can take place prior to or during the shaping operation, or by applY1ng the dissolved or dispersed compound to the polymer, with or without subsequent evaporation of the solvent. In the case of elastomers, these can also be stabilized as latices. A further possibility for incorporating the additives of the invention into polymers is to add them before, during or directly after the polymerization of the corresponding monomers.<br><br>
The films can be coextruded by film extrusion such as blown film extrusion or by cast film extrusion or they can be laminated and they can include layers based on polymers such as polyamide (PA 6 or 6,6 or 11 or 12 or 6/6,6 copolymer including OPA), polyethylene terephtalate (PET including OPET), polyethylene naphtalate (PEN), ethylene vinyl alcohol (EvOH), polypropylene (including OPP), ethylene acrylic acid copolymers and their salts, ethylene methacrylic acid copolymers and their salts, or Polyvinylidenchloride (PVDC) or aluminum foil. The films can also be coated with the above polymers or silicone-based coatings (e.g. SiOx) or aluminum oxide or any other coating applied by plasma, web coating or electron-beam coating.<br>
A further aspect of the invention is a process for enhancing plant growth, comprising exposing a plant to actinic radiation behind or under a thermoplastic polymer composition in the form of a film for greenhouses and small tunnel covers, a film or a filament for shading nets and screens, a mulch film, a non- woven or molded article for the protection of young plants containing a condensation product of<br><br><br>
a UV-absorber and a sterically hindered amine, containing at least one radical of the formula<br><br>
a UV-absorber; or<br>
a sterically hindered amine, containing at least one radical of the formula<br><br>
a UV-absorber and a sterically hindered amine, containing at least one radical of the formula<br><br><br>
as plant growth enhancing additive in thermoplastic polymers for agricultural applications in the form of films for greenhouses and small tunnel covers, films or filaments for shading nets and screens, mulch films, non-wovens or molded articles for the protection of young plants.<br>
Definitions and preferences have already been given for the composition and apply also for the process and use.<br>
Nets can for example be used for increased ventilation (and as a barrier to insects) or for it's shading and energy savings.<br>
Nets can be manufactured in different ways. One is to cut films in small stripes which are then woven. Another possibility is to start with monofilament fibers, which are subsequently woven. A further possibility for making shading nets (also called screens) is more complex. A net is formed from woven monofilament fibers with tapes woven through this net. These tapes can be based on aluminium and/or a broad variety of polymers. In some cases, the monofilament net can be laminated on 1 or both sides with e.g. PE.<br>
In general greenhouses and small tunnel covers are preferred. The plants, which are grown in greenhouses and small tunnel covers and the growth of which can be enhanced by the instant invention are for example flowers, legumes, fruits and crop.<br>
