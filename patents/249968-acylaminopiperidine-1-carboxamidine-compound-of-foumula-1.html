				<td>INHIBITORS<br>
The'present invention relates to a series of novel compounds that are selective inhibitors of the enzyme plasma kallikrein, to pharmaceutical compositions comprising these inhibitors, and the use of such compositions in the treatment of human diseases.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
The enzyme plasma kallikrein, also known by the classification EC.3.4.21.34, is a member of a family of trypsin-like serine protease that also includes tissue kallikrein, thrombin, trypsin and plasmin. It is found in plasma as an inactive zymogen that is activated by Factor XI la. The enzyme has a broad spectrum of activity. Plasma kallikrein liberates the vasoactive peptide bradykinin from high molecular weight kininogen by cleavage of Lys-Arg and Arg-Ser bonds. The same peptide can also be liberated from low molecular weight kininogen in the presence of neutrophil elastase. It is also capable of activating prourokinase and plasminogen, and is also thought to participate in the conversion of prorenin to renin. Plasma kallikrein is an essential component of the intrinsic blood coagulation cascade although its role does not involve the release of bradykinin or enzymatic cleavage. High molecular weight kininogen, the preferred substrate for plasma kallikrein, is essential for the activation in this cascade (K. D. Bhoola et a/., Pharm. Rev., 1992,44,1-80).<br>
The physiological effects of plasma kallikrein are likely to result from the proteolytic cleavage of kininogens to liberate kinins or of other substrates, e.g. precursors of growth factors. Kinins such as bradykinin are potent mediators of inflammation. In addition they influence cellular functions such as blood pressure, local blood flow, glucose transport and cell proliferation. These cellular actions which are modified by release of secondary messengers such as platelet activating factor, leukotrienes, prostaglandins, Substance P, acetylcholine and noradrenaline.<br>
Several groups have disclosed synthetic inhibitors of plasma kallikrein. These include arginine ketomethylene derivatives (WO 92/04371 and D. M. Evans et alâ€ž Immunopharmacology, 1996, 32, 115-116), noragmatine and agmatine derivatives (WO 95/07291, WO 94/29335), benzamidine derivatives (J. StOrzbecher et al., Brazilian J. Med. Biol.   Res.   1994,   27,   1929-1934),   boronic  acid  derivatives  (US  5,187,157)   and<br>
aminomethylcyclohexanoyl derivatives (N. Teno et a/., Chem. Pharm. Bull., 1993, 41, 1079-1090). The aminomethylcyclohexanoyl derivatives have been shown to be active in models of collagen-induced arthritis in mice (Y. Fujimora et a/., Agents Actions, 1993, 39, 42-48) and endotoxin-induced disseminated intravascular coagulation (OIC) in rats (S. Okamoto et al., Agents Actions (Supplement), 1992, 38(Part 1), 198-205). The boronic acid derivatives are active in models of inflammatory bowel disease (A. Stadnicki et a/., Digestive Diseases and Sciences, 1996,41, 912-920 and FASEB, 1998,12,325-333).<br>
Selectivity with respect to the other members of the trypsin-like serine protease family is an important issue. Inhibitors of tissue kallikrein displaying poor plasma kalllkrein activity have previously been reported (M. Szelke et a/., Brazilian J. Med. Biol. Res. 1994, 27, 1935 and D. M. Evans ef a/., Immunopharmacology, 1996, 32,117), but there remains a need for compounds that selectively inhibit plasma kallikrein and not tissue kallikrein.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a series of acylaminopiperidine-1-carboxamidines that are inhibitors of plasma kallikrein. These compounds demonstrate good selectivity for plasma kallikrein, and are potentially useful in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease, arthritis, inflammation, septic shock, hypotension, cancer, adutt respiratory distress syndrome, disseminated intravascular coagulation, cardiopulmonary bypass surgery and bleeding from post-operative surgery. The invention further relates to pharmaceutical compositions of the inhibitors, to the use of the compositions as therapeutic agents, and to methods of treatment using the compositions.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
In a first aspect, the present invention comprises a series of novel 4-(dipeptidylamino)-piperidine-1-carboxamidines according to general formula 1.<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
In general formula 1, R1 represents a group selected from a hydrogen atom (H), a lower alkyl group, a group according to R4-CO, a group according to R4-02CCH2, a group according to R5-OCO, and a group according to R5-S02. R2 represents a group selected from a lower alkyl group, a cycloalkyl or (C5-C12)cycloalkylalkyl group, either of which may optionally be substituted with an alkyl or alkoxy group, an aralkyl group which may optionally be substituted with up to three groups chosen from F, CI, Br, I, OH, lower alkyl, <br>
O-(lower alkyl), O-benzyl, NH2l N02, NH-acyl, CN and CF3l and an aralkyloxymethyl group which may optionally be substituted with up to three groups chosen from F, CI, Br, OH, lower alkyl and O-(lower alkyl). Alternatively, R1 and R2 together may constitute an oriho-xylylene group (o-C6H4(CH2)2). The aromatic ring of this xylylene group may optionally be substituted with a group selected from F, CI, Br, OH, lower alkyl and O-(lower alkyf).<br>
R3 represents a group selected from H, OH and O-(lower alkyl).<br>
R4 represents a group selected from H, lower alkyl and phenyl.<br>
R5 represents a group selected from lower alkyl, phenyl and benzyl.<br>
In the context of the present disclosure, the terms "alkyl group" and "lower alkyl group" are used interchangeably to denote linear and branched saturated hydrocarbon groups with between 1 and 8 carbon atoms, such as methyl, ethyl, isopropyl, tert-butyl, neopentyl and isooctyl groups.<br>
The term "cycloalkyl group" Is used to denote monocyclic or polycyclic saturated hydrocarbon groups with between 3 and 12 carbon atoms, such as cyclopropyl, cyclohexyl, bicyclo[4.4.0]decyl (i.e. decahydronaphthyl) and adamantyl groups.<br>
The term "cycloakylalkyl group" is used to denote alkyl groups that bear a cycloalkyl group as a substituent, such as cyclohexylmethyl and 1-(cyclopentyl)ethyl groups. Where a limit is specified, as in (Ca-Cb)cycloa!kylalkyl, this denotes that the cycloalkyl moiety has between a and b carbon atoms.<br>
The term "alkoxy group" is used to denote O-(alkyl) groups.<br>
The term "acyl group" is used to denote formyl (H-CO) and alkyl-CO groups.<br>
The term "aralkyl group" is used to denote alkyl groups that bear an aryl group as a substituent, such as benzyl and 1-naphthylmethyl groups. The term "aryl group" includes phenyl, naphthyl, furyl, thienyl, pyrrolyl and pyridyl groups.<br>
The term "aralkyloxymethyl group" is used to denote aralkyl-OCH2 groups.<br>
The compounds of the present invention all have a guanidine functional group and so can form addition salts with acids. To the extent that such acids are pharmaceutically acceptable then these salts fall within the scope of the invention. Examples of suitable acids include acetic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, fumaric acid, malic acid, citric acid, benzoic acid, benzenesulphonic acid, hydrochloric acid, sulphuric acid and phosphoric acid. Certain compounds within the invention have an acidic functional group and so can form salts with alkaline and alkaline earth metals. Again, insofar as these are pharmaceutically acceptable they are included in the scope of the invention. Examples of such salts include the sodium, potassium and calcium salts.<br>
The compounds of the present invention all have at least two stereogenic centres (asymmetric carbon atoms) and so can exist as optical isomers, such as enantiomers, diastereomers and epimers. All such isomers are included, in the scope of the present invention. Mixtures of such isomers, including (but not limited to) racemic mixtures are also included in the scope of the invention.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the present invention comprises compounds according to general formula 1 in which R1 is selected from H, lower alkyl and R4-02CCH2.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the present invention comprises compounds according to general formula 1 in which R2 is selected from (C6-C10)cycloalkyialkyl, benzyl optionally substituted with up to three groups chosen from F, CI, Br, OH, lower alkyl and O-(lower alkyl), phenethyl optionally substituted with up to three groups chosen from F, CI, Br, OH, lower alkyl and O-(lower alkyl), and benzyloxyrnethyl optionally substituted with up to three groups chosen from F, CI, Br, OH, lower alkyl and O-(lower alkyl). More preferably R2 is selected from cyclohexylmethyl, decahydronaphth-2-ylmethyl, benzyl, 4-fluorobenzyl, 4-chlorobenzyl, 4-hydroxybenzyl, 4-(lower alkyl)oxybenzyl, Î±-hydroxybenzyl, Î±-methoxybenzyl, phenethyl and benzyloxyrnethyl.<br>

The compounds of the present invention may be prepared by the methods generally known in the art, and particularly those methods used in the field of peptide chemistry. A useful starting material Is 4-amino-1-benzylpiperidine (2). Protection of the primary amine with a tert-butyloxycarbonyl (Boc) group to give 3 and hydrogenolysis provides piperidine derivative 4. This can be treated with isothiourea derivative 5 to give the carboxamidinopiperidine derivative 6 in which the amine and guanidine functional groups are differentially protected.<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
The carboxamidinopiperidine derivative 6 can then be selectively deprotected and coupled to an N-protected amino acid 7 to give intermediate 8.<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
The elaboration of intermediate 8 to give the final product depends to some extent on the nature of R1. When R1 is R5-OCO then the synthesis may conveniently proceed via intermediate 9.<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
When R1 is H, R4-CO, R4-02CCH2 or R5-S02 then the synthesis may conveniently proceed<br>
via intermediates 10 and 11.<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
Deprotection of the guanidine functional group gives compounds according to general formula 1 in which R1 is H.   Derivatisation of the primary amine prior to deprotection of the guanidine gives access to other embodiments of R1.<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
Intermediates 12, 13 and 14 may then be deprotected to give the corresponding compounds according to general formula 1.<br>
When R1 is alkyl, or when R1 and R2 together form a xylylene group, the synthesis may<br>
conveniently proceed via intermediate 15.<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
Two deprotection steps then give the corresponding compounds according to general formula 1.<br>
The compounds of the present invention are potent and selective inhibitors of plasma kallikrein. They are therefore useful in the treatment of disease conditions for which over activity of plasma kallikrein is a causative factor. Generally, for use in such treatment the compounds will be formulated for administration to the patient    The pharmaceutical<br>
formulation may be a solid or liquid, such as a tablet, capsule, solution or suspension. Methods of preparing such formulations are well known in the pharmaceutical art.<br>
The compositions will be administered to the patient under the supervision of the attending physician.<br>

Determination of the inhibition constant K1 for plasma kallikrein<br>
Inhibition of plasma kailikrein activity in vitro was determined using standard published methods (see e.g. Johansen et al., Int. J. Tiss. Reac. 1986, 8,185; Short et al. Biochem. Pharmacol., 1992, 43, 1209; Storzebecher et a/., Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler, 1992, 373, 1025). Human plasma kailikrein (Callbiochem) was incubated at 37Â°C with three different concentrations of the chromogenic substrate S-2302 (Chromogenix AB) and various concentrations of the test compound. Residual enzyme activity (initial rate of reaction) was determined by measuring the change in optical absorbance at 405nm and the inhibitory constant K1 for the test compound as determined from a Dixon plot (Dixon, Biochem. J., 1953,55,170).  Typical results are presented in the Table.<br>
