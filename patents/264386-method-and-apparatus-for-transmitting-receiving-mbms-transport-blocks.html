METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR TRANSMITTING/RECEIVING MBMS<br>
TRANSPORT BLOCKS<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001] The present invention relates to a method and apparatus for<br>
transmitting/receiving multimedia broadcast/multicast service (MBMS) transport blocks.<br>
Although the present invention is suitable for a wide scope of applications, it is<br>
particularly suitable for enabling a user equipment to receive the MBMS blocks more<br>
efficiently.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
[0002] PIG. 1 Is a block diagram of a network structure of a universal mobile<br>
telecommunications system (UMTS). Referring to FIG. 1, the universal mobile<br>
telecommunications system (hereinafter, referred to as 'UMTS') includes a user<br>
equipment 1 (hereinafter, referred to as 'UB'), a UMTS terrestrial radio access network<br>
2 (hereinafter, referred to as 'UTRAN') and a core network 3 (hereinafter, referred to as<br>
'CN'). The UTRAN 2 includes at least one radio network sub-system 4 (hereinafter,<br>
referred to as 'RNS') and each RNS includes a radio network controller 5 (hereinafter,<br>
referred to as 'RNC') and at least one base station 6 (hereinafter, referred to as 'Node<br>
B') managed by the RNC. The Node B 6 includes at least one cell.<br>
[0003] FIG. 2 is an architectural diagram of a radio interface protocol between a<br>
UE 1 and UTRAN 2. Referring to FIG. 2, the radio interface protocol horizontally<br>
includes a physical layer, a data link layer and a network layer and the radio interface<br><br>
WO 2006/104334	2	PCT/KR2006/001125<br>
protocol vertically includes a user plane for data information transfer and a control<br>
plane for signaling transfer. The protocol layers in FIG. 2 can be divided into L1 (first<br>
layer), L2 (second layer), and L3 (third layer) based on lower three layers of the open<br>
system interconnection (OSI) standard model widely known in the communications<br>
systems.<br>
[0004] The physical layer as the first layer provides an information transfer<br>
service to an upper layer using physical channels. The physical layer is connected to a<br>
medium access control (MAC) layer above the physical layer via transport channels<br>
through which data are transferred between the medium access control layer and the<br>
physical layer. Data is transmitted between different physical layers, and more<br>
particularly, between the physical layer of a transmitting side and the physical layer of a<br>
receiving side via physical channels.<br>
[0005] The medium access control (MAC) layer of the second layer provides<br>
services to a radio link control (hereinafter abbreviated RLC) layer above the MAC<br>
layer via logical channels. The RLC layer of the second layer supports reliable data<br>
transfer and is operative in segmentation and concatenation of RLC service data units<br>
(SDUs) sent down from an upper layer.<br>
[0006] The RLC layer operates according to one of three modes; a transparent<br>
mode, an unacknowledged mode and an acknowledged mode. A major Sanction of the<br>
RLC layer is an SDU discard function. A transmitting side RLC entity discards old<br>
RLC SDUs stored in the RLC entity in order to prevent an RLC buffer from being<br>
overloaded. The SDU discard function plays an important role in securing a quality of<br>
service (hereinafter 'QoS) of a radio bearer service provided by the RLC layer.<br><br>
WO 2006/104334	3	PCT/KR2006/001125<br>
[0007] A condition for the transmitting side RLC entity to discard an SDU is<br>
the use of a timer or a retransmission count limitation. In the transparent or<br>
unacknowledged mode, only the timer is used. In the acknowledged mode, both of the<br>
timer and retransmission count limitation can be used.<br>
[0008] When an RLC layer operates in transparent mode, no header information<br>
is added to an RLC SDU transferred from an upper layer and data is transmitted to a<br>
receiving side in RLC PDU format. It is decided to use segmentation and concatenation<br>
of RLC SDUs when establishing a radio bearer (hereinafter abbreviated 'RB').<br>
[0009] A transmitting side transparent mode RLC entity and a receiving side<br>
transparent mode RLC entity are configured to transfer data unidirectionally. Therefore,<br>
when data transmission is bidirectional, the UE and UTRAN should each be equipped<br>
with the transmitting side transparent mode RLC entity and the receiving side<br>
transparent mode RLC entity.<br>
[0010] When an. RLC layer operates in unacknowledged mode, header<br>
information is added to an RLC SDU transferred from an upper layer and data is then<br>
transmitted to a receiving side in RLC PDU format, If transmission of an RLC PDU<br>
fails, retransmission is not supported. Therefore, even if data is lost or a problem occurs<br>
during transmission, the receiving side does not request retransmission but rather<br>
discards associated data.<br>
[0011] In the unacknowledged mode, a transmitting side unacknowledged mode<br>
ELC entity transmits data to a receiving side unacknowledged mode RLC entity<br>
unidirectionally. Therefore, when data transmission is bidirectional, the UE and<br><br>
WO 2006/104334	4	PCT/KR2006/001125<br>
UTRAN should each be equipped with the transmitting side unacknowledged mode<br>
RLC entity and the receiving side unacknowledged mode RLC entity.<br>
[0012] When an RLC layer operates in acknowledged mode, header<br>
information is added to an RLC SDU transferred from an upper layer and data is then<br>
transmitted to a receiving side in RLC PDU format. If transmission of an RLC PDU<br>
fails, retransmission is supported.<br>
[0013] Specifically, a transmitting side RLC layer receives status information<br>
facilitating a determination of transmission success or failure with regard to a<br>
corresponding packet from a receiving side RLC layer and then retransmits an RLC<br>
PDU that needs to be retransmitted. In the acknowledged mode, response mode RLC<br>
entities, each of which includes a transmitting unit and a receiving unit, exist in both the<br>
UE and UTRAN, to enable bi-directional communication.<br>
[0014] A radio resource control (RRC) layer located on the lowest part of the<br>
third layer is defined in the control plane only and controls the logical channels, the<br>
transport channels, and the physical channels with configuration, reconfiguration, and<br>
release of radio bearers (RBs). An RB is a service offered by the second layer for the<br>
data transfer between the UE 1 and the UTRAN 2. Generally, configuring an RB refers<br>
to defining the characteristics of protocol layers and channels necessary for providing a<br>
specific service and is to establish respective specific parameters and operational<br>
methods for them.<br>
[0015] A multimedia broadcast/multicast service (hereinafter, referred to as<br>
'MBMS') offers a streaming or background service to a plurality of UEs 1 using a<br>
downlink dedicated MBMS bearer service. An MBMS is provided during one session,<br><br>
WO 2006/104334	5	PCT/KR2006/001125<br>
and data for the MBMS is transmitted to the plurality of UEs 1 via the MBMS bearer<br>
service during an ongoing session only. A UE 1 performs activation first for receiving<br>
the MBMS to which the UE has subscribed and receives the activated services only.<br>
[0016] The UTRAN 2 provides the MBMS bearer service to at least one UE 1<br>
using radio bearers. The radio bearers (RBs) used by the UTRAN 2 include a point-to-<br>
point radio bearer and a point-to-multipoint radio bearer.<br>
[0017] The point-to-point radio bearer is a bi-directional radio bearer and is<br>
configured by a logical channel DTCH (dedicated traffic channel), a transport channel<br>
DCH (dedicated channel), and a physical channel DPCH (dedicated physical channel)<br>
or a physical channel SCCPCH (secondary common control physical channel). The<br>
point-to-multipoint radio bearer is a unidirectional downlink radio bearer and is<br>
configured by a logical channel MTCH (MBMS traffic channel), a transport channel<br>
FACH (forward access channel), and a physical channel SCPCH. The logical channel<br>
MTCH is configured for each MBMS offered to one cell and is used for transmitting<br>
user-plane data of a specific MBMS to a plurality of UEs.<br>
[0018J As illustrated in FIG. 3, a logical channel MCCH (MBMS control<br>
channel) in a conventional system is a point-to-multipoint downlink channel used in<br>
transmitting control information associated with the MBMS. The logical channel<br>
MCCH is mapped to the transport channel FACH (forward access channel), while the<br>
transport channel FACH is mapped to the physical channel SCCPCH (secondary<br>
common control physical channel). A cell has only one MCCH.<br>
[0019] The UTRAN 2 providing MBMS services transmits MCCH information<br>
through the MCCH channel to at least one UE 1. The MCCH information includes<br><br>
WO 2006/104334	6	PCT/KR2006/001125<br>
notification messages, specifically RRC messages related to the MBMS. For example,<br>
the MCCH information may include messages indicating MBMS service information,<br>
messages indicating point-to-multipoint radio bearer information or access information<br>
indicating that RRC connection for the MBMS is needed.<br>
[0020] FIG. 4 is a diagram illustrating how MCCH information is transmitted in<br>
a conventional method. FIG. 5 illustrates a conventional method for providing an<br>
MBMS.<br>
[0021] As illustrated in FIG. 4, the UTRAN 2 providing an MBMS service<br>
transmits the MCCH information to a plurality of UEs 1 via the MCCH channel. The<br>
MCCH information is periodically transmitted according to a modification period and a<br>
repetition period,<br>
[0022] The MCCH information is categorized into critical information and non-<br>
critical information. The non-critical information can be freely modified each<br>
modification period or each repetition period. However, the critical information can be<br>
modified only each modification period.<br>
[0023] Specifically, the critical information is repeated one time each repetition<br>
period. However, the modified critical information can be transmitted only at a start<br>
point of the modification period.<br>
[0024] If at least two neighbor cells transmit the same information related to an<br>
MBMS via an MTCH, a UE receives the MTCH transmitted from the cells by soft<br>
combining in order to increase its reception sensitivity. In order to facilitate soft<br>
combining, transport blocks from the cells in the same time interval should be identical<br><br>
WO 2006/104334	7	PCT/KR2006/001125<br>
to each other and a UTRAN should transmit transport blocks for one transport channel<br>
only for any given transmission time interval (hereinafter abbreviated TTI).<br>
[0025] One transport block is delivered over one transport channel for one TTI.<br>
If there are transport blocks to be transmitted, a transmitting side MAC delivers at least<br>
one transport block to a physical layer according to a TTI unit. A transmitting side<br>
physical layer encodes the transport blocks received from the MAC for transmission to<br>
a receiving side physical layer.<br>
[0026] In order, to allow the receiving side physical layer to decode the<br>
encoded data correctly, as illustrated in FIG. 3, the transmitting side transmits transport<br>
format (hereinafter abbreviated 'TF') information to the receiving side together with the<br>
encoded data, After receiving the TF information from the transmitting side, the<br>
receiving side physical layer decodes the received data using the TF in order to<br>
reconfigure the transport blocks. The reconfigured transport blocks are transferred to a<br>
receiving side MAC according to a TTI unit.<br>
[0027] The TF information includes various attributes related to one transport<br>
channel. Attributes of the TF information can be classified as semi-static and dynamic.<br>
Semi-static attributes are TF information that can be changed slowly by an RRC<br>
message. Dynamic attributes are TF information that can be changed fast by TTI or<br>
radio frame unit.<br>
[0028] A dynamic attribute is transferred via a transport format combination<br>
indicator (hereinafter abbreviated 'TFCI'). The transmitting side transmits the TFCI to<br>
the receiving side via a control field of a physical channel.<br><br>
WO 2006/104334	s	PCT/KR2006/001125<br>
[0029] Typical dynamic attributes of the TF information are transport block<br>
size and transport block set size. The transport block size is defined as a set of transport<br>
blocks in a TTL<br>
[0030] One transport block is defined as one MAC PDU (protocol data unit),<br>
which includes one MAC SDU (service data unit) and one MAC header. At least one<br>
transport block can be delivered during one TTL<br>
[0031] The sizes of the transport blocks transmitted for the same TTI are equal.<br>
Therefore, a size of the transport block set is a multiple of the size of the transport block.<br>
[0032] An RRC establishes a set of size values of transportable transport blocks<br>
for one transport channel. A set of the transport blocks of one transport channel is called<br>
a transport format set (TFS).<br>
[0033] At least two transport channels are mapped to one physical channel for<br>
transmission. The RRC establishes a set of combinations of the transport blocks of the<br>
transport channels that can be simultaneously transmitted for the same transport section<br>
via the corresponding physical channel. A set of the combinations (transport format<br>
combinations) of the transport blocks of at least two transport channels mapped to one<br>
physical channel is called a TFCS (transport format combination set).<br>
[0034] An RNC transmits TFCS information for the physical channel to the<br>
transmitting and receiving sides. In order to transmit TFCS information, the RNC<br>
transforms the TFCS information into calculated transport format combination<br>
(hereinafter abbreviated CTFC) information for transmission to the transmitting and<br>
receiving sides rather than directly transmitting the TFCS information.<br><br>
WO 2006/104334	*	PCT/KR2006/001125<br>
[0035] A connection fame number (herein abbreviated 'CFN') is a frame<br>
counter used for second layer (Layer2)/transport channel synchronization between a UE<br>
and a UTRAN. A CFN value is associated with one TBS and is transmitted via a MAC-<br>
LI SAP.<br>
[0036] The CFN is used for common frame reference in Layer2. For example,<br>
the CFN can be used for synchronized transport channel reconfiguration.<br>
[0037] In MBMS transmission, a UE can increase its reception sensitivity by<br>
receiving the same MBMS transport blocks from several neighbor cells providing the<br>
same MBMS. In general, transmission of an MBMS transport block can start from a<br>
CFN corresponding to a multiplication of the number of frames necessary for<br>
transmission of one TTI.<br>
[0038], Therefore, if .several different MBMS transport blocks are transmitted by<br>
being mapped to one channel, transmission of MBMS transport blocks may not be<br>
possible within a required time to enable soft combining, In order to solve this problem,<br>
MBMS service transmission is delayed, thereby wasting channel resources.<br>
[0039] Therefore, it is necessary to initiate transmission of MBMS transport<br>
blocks from different timing points as well as the CFN corresponding to the<br>
multiplication of frames required for the transmission of one TTL However, in the<br>
conventional method, a UE is unable to determine information related to a transmission<br>
start timing point of an MBMS transport block, thereby reducing efficiency of soft<br>
combining.<br>
[0040] Therefore, there is a need for a method and apparatus for transmitting/<br>
receiving multimedia broadcast/multicast service (MBMS) transport blocks that enables<br><br>
WO 2006/104334	10	PCT/KR2006/001125<br>
a UE to determine information related to a transmission start timing point of an MBMS<br>
transport block, thereby increasing efficiency of soft combining. The present invention<br>
addresses these and other needs.<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
[0071] The present invention relates to an apparatus and method for<br>
transrrritting/ receiving multimedia broadcast/multicast service (MBMS) transport<br>
blocks, whereby the MBMS transport blocks can be efficiently received by a user<br>
equipment (UE). Although the present invention is illustrated with respect to a mobile<br>
communication device, it is contemplated that the present invention may be utilized<br>
anytime it is desired to transmit and receive transport blocks efficiently.<br>
[0072] Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred embodiments of<br>
the present invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings.<br>
Wherever possible, the same reference numbers will be used throughout the drawings to<br>
refer to the same or Eke parts.<br>
[0073] FIG 5 is a diagram illustrating transmission of an MBMS transport<br>
block. As illustrated in FIG 5, transmission of the transport block can start from a time<br>
corresponding to a connection frame number (CFN) that corresponds to a multiple of<br>
the number of frames transmitted during one transmit time interval (TTI) such that<br>
division by the number of frames yields a remainder of 0'. Specifically, the transport<br>
block transmission can be initiated at a timing point corresponding to a CFN that<br>
satisfies Formula 1.<br>
[0074] [Formula 1]	CFN mod F = 0<br><br>
WO 2006/104334	18	PCT/KR2006/001125<br>
[0075J In Formula 1, 'F' is the number of frames required for one TTI<br>
transmission. As illustrated in FIG 5, since the number of frames necessary for one TTI<br>
is '8', the CFN available for a transmission timing point of transport block is 80, 88,96<br>
or 104.<br>
[0076] To perform soft combining in a physical layer of a receiving side, the<br>
same transport block should be received from a neighboring cell within a time of (1 TTI<br>
+ 1 slot). However, if TTI has to be simultaneously used for different services over one<br>
channel, transmission block reception from a neighboring cell is normally impossible<br>
within a soft combining window, thereby making soft combining impossible.<br>
[0077] In order to overcome this problem, it is necessary to initiate transport<br>
block transmission at a timing point not corresponding to a CFN corresponding to a<br>
multiple of the number of frames required for one TTF transmission such that division<br>
by the number of frames yields a remainder of '0'. Specifically, a transport block must<br>
be transmitted at a timing point that does not satisfy Formula 1.<br>
[0078] In order to accomplish this, information about a transmission timing<br>
point of an MBMS transport block can be determined as a value that has a uniform time<br>
interval from a CFN that satisfies Formula 1, such as a frame offset, The frame offset<br>
information can be delivered to a Node B and a UE to indicate a timing point from<br>
which transmission of a corresponding transport block begins. Alternatively,<br>
transmission timing point information can be determined as a new CFN indicating a<br>
transmission start point of an MBMS transport block irrespective of a CFN that satisfies<br>
Formula 1.<br><br>
WO 2006/104334	19	PCT/KR2006/001125<br>
[0079] FIG 6 illustrates a method of transmitting transmission timing point<br>
information for an MBMS transport block. As illustrated in FIG. 6, transmission timing<br>
point information related to an MBMS transport block is transmitted to a UE from an<br>
RNC.<br>
[0080] A frame offset is one example of the transmission timing point<br>
information related to an MBMS transport block. For instance, with reference to FIG 5,<br>
the frame offset may be information indicating that transmission of a transport block<br>
begins at a timing point with a certain delay from CFN 80, 88 or 96. Specifically, if the<br>
frame offset value is '2' transmission of a transport block can be initiated at a timing<br>
point corresponding to a value of CFN 82, 90 or 98.<br>
[0081] A UE can correctly obtain a transmission timing point of an MBMS<br>
transport block using the corresponding transmission timing point information. The<br>
transmission timing point information of the transport block may differ in each cell.<br>
Specifically, a UE can receive different types of transmission timing point information<br>
from several cells.<br>
[0082] The UE can deliver the information received regarding the MBMS<br>
transmission timing point to a physical layer. The physical layer of the UE can correctly<br>
determine a reception timing of an SCCPCH, which is an MBMS physical layer<br>
transport channel corresponding to a transport block transmitted from aUTRAN, using<br>
this information.<br>
[0083] The MBMS service transmission timing may be a new CFN generated<br>
specifically for the MBMS. The UE receives the new CFN and determines an accurate<br>
transmission timing point of the transport block. The determined transmission timing<br><br>
WO 2006/104334	20	PCT/KR2006/001125<br>
point can be provided to the physical layer in order to determine an accurate timing<br>
point of an SCCPCH carrying a corresponding transport block.<br>
[0084] The transmission timing point of an MBMS transport block can be<br>
transmitted to the UE via an RRC signaling message. Furthermore, the transmission<br>
timing point of the MBMS transport block can be transmitted to the UE via an MCCH<br>
or BCCH or can be included in a MBMS COMMON RB INFORMATION message, a<br>
MBMS Current Cell p-t-m rb Information message or an MBMS Neighboring Cell p-t-<br>
m rb Information message.<br>
