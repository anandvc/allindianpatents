PROPAN-1-ONE"<br>
WARNER-LAMBERT COMPANY LLC, a corporation organized and existing under and by virtue of the laws of the State of Delaware and having an office and place of business at 201 Tabor Road, Morris Plains, New Jersey 07950, United States of America<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br><br>
The   present   invention   relates   to   derivatives    of   compound    3-amino-l-morpholine-4-yl-propan-1-one.<br>
An improved synthesis for the preparation of 5-(4-fIuorophenyl)-l-[2-((2R,4R)^-hydroxy-6HDXo4etrahydro-py^^ ljy-pyrrole-3-carboxyllc acid phenylarnide is described where methyl ' cyanoacetate is converted in eight operations or fewer to the desired product, as well as other valuable intermediates usedM'the process.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
5-(4-Fluorophenyl)-1 -[2"((2R,4R)-4-hydroxy-6~oxo-tetrahydro-pyran--2-yl)-ethyl]-2-isopropyI-4-phenyl-li?-pyrrole-3-carboxylic acid phenylarnide is a valuable intermediate in the synthesis of Iipitor® (atorvastatra. calcium) known by the chemical name [R-(R*,R*)]-2-(4T-fJuorophenyI)-|335-dihydroxy-:5-(l-memylemyI)-3-phenyi-4-f(phenylammo)carb6nyI]-lH-pyrrole-l"heptanoicacid calcium salt (2:1) trihydrate. The aforementioned compound is useful as an inhibitor of the enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-memylglutary]-coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA reductase) and is thus •useful as a hypolipidemic and/or hypocholesterqlemic agent.<br>
United States Patent No. 4,681,893, which, is herein incorporated by reference, discloses certain trans-6~[2-(3- or4-carboxainido-substitated-pyirol-l-yl)alkylJ-4-hydroxy-pyran-2-ones including trans (±)~5-(4~fLuorophenyl)-2-(l -methyIethyl)-N, 4-diphenyl-1 -] (2-tetrahydro-4-hydroxy-6-oxo-2H-pyran-2^yl)ethyl]-lH-pyrrole-3-carboxamide.<br>

5,149,837; 5,155,251; 5,216,174; 5,245,047; 5,248,793; 5,280,126; 5,397,792;<br>

Patent Nos. 5,969,156 and 6,121,461 which are herein incorporated by reference. A synthetic procedure for the preparation of 5-(4-fluorophenyl)-l-[2-<br>
((2R,4R)^-hyd^oxy-6xo-tetrahydro-pyran-2-yl)-ethyl]-2-isopropyl-4-phenyl-<br>
lif-pyrrole-3-carboxyIic acid phenylamide is disclosed in United States Patent No. 5,273,995.<br>
The asymmetric reduction of p-ketoesters, as well as P-diketones, is a well-established transformation in organic synthesis. However, the complexity of these reactions increases in the case of 1,3,5-tricarbonyl systems and poor yields and poor stereoselectivities often result In fact, investigations by Saburi (Tetrahedron, 1997,1993;49) and Carpentier (Eur. J. Org. Chem. 1999;3421) have independently demonstrated low to moderate diastereo- and/or enantio-selectivities for diketoester asymmetric hydrogenarions. Furthermore, the fact that the processes in the prior art require high pressure hydrogenation and extended reaction times makes these procedures impractical and not amenable to large-scale manufacturing processes.<br>
However, we have surprisingly and unexpectedly found that the diol esters of the present invention, (R)-7-[2-(4-fluorophenyI)-5-isopropyl-3-phenyl-4-phenylcarbamoyl-pyrrol-l-yl]-3,5-dihydroxy-heptanoic acid esters, can be obtained directly from the corresponding 1,3,5-tricarbonyl precursors in a highly stereoselective manner via a mild and efficient ruthenium-catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation reaction utilizing chiral non-racemic diphosphine ligands in the presence of secondary activating agents such as protic acids.<br><br>
The object of the present invention is a short and efficient process for the preparation of 5-(4-fiuorophenyl)-l -[2-((2R,4R)-4-hydroxy-6-oxo-tetrahydro-.pyran-2-yJ)-ethyIJ-2-isopropyl-4-phenyl-lif-pyrrole-3-carboxylic acid phenylamide. The present process avoids the use of a costly chiral raw material ((R)-4-cyano-3-hydroxy-butyric acid ethyl ester), and a low temperature diastereoselective borane reduction. Furthermore, a key Paal-Knorr condensation step, common to the present and prior art processes, has been improved through a significant decrease in reaction time.<br>
Thus, the present process has significant advantages over the prior art processes and is amenable to large-scale synthesis.<br>

A nitrogen inerted pressure reactor is charged with 7-[2-(4-fluorophenyl)-5-isopropyl-3-phenyl-4-phenylcarbamoyl-pyrrol-l-yl]-3,5-dioxo-heptanoicacid, ethyl ester (100.0 mmol) and MeOH (250 mL). The resulting slurry is heated with stirring to ca. 55°C to afford a homogeneous solution. The vessel and its contents are degassed via three 50 psi pressure purges with argon. Under a steady flow of argon, 1 M methanolic HBr (7.0 mmol) and the RuCl2(DMF)n[(R)-Cl-MeO-BIPHEP)] catalyst (0.5 mmol) are added, and the reactor is given an additional 50 psi pressure purge with argon. The atmosphere is switched to hydrogen via three 50 psi pressure purges. The reaction is stirred vigorously at 65°C under a<br><br>
sustained pressure of hydrogen (50 psi) until hydrogen uptake ceases. The reaction is allowed to cool to ambient temperature, and the hydrogen pressure is released and replaced with nitrogen. The crude MeOH solution of (5R)-7-[2-(4-fluorophenyl)-5-isopropyl-3 -phenyl-4-phenylcarbamoyl-pyrrol-1 -yl] -3,5-dihydroxy-heptanoic acid, methyl ester is carried on to subsequent steps without purification, or optionally, it can be isolated via flash column chromatography on silica gel, eluting with ethyl acetate-heptane mixtures.

(50 psi) for ca. 3 hours at 50°C. The reaction mixture is cooled to ambient temperature, the H2 is replaced by N2, and the catalyst is removed via filtration. This solution of (3R,5R)-7-[2-(4-fluorophenyl)-5-isopropyl-3-phenyl-4-phenylcarbamoyl-pynt&gt;l-l-yl]-3,5-dihydroxy-heptanoic acid, methyl ester is transferred to a nitrogen inerted reactor charged with KOH (110.0 mmol) and water (300 mL). The mixture is heated under a nitrogen atmosphere to an internal temperature of ca. 85°C. During this time, MeOH is removed via distillation. The resulting reaction mixture is allowed to cool to 45°C, where it is washed with<br>
MteE (2 x 150 mL). The MteE phases are separated and discarded. To the 45°C aqueous phase is added toluene (125 mL), followed by a slow addition of 6N HC1 (20 mL). The two-phase mixture is stirred for 10 minutes and the layers are separated. The aqueous phase is extracted with a second portion of toluene (125 mL) and is discarded. The combined organics are heated to reflux under a Dean-Stark water trap for 2.5 hours under argon. The reaction mixture is cooled to 65°C and seeded with 5-(4-fluorophenyl)-l-[2-((2R,4RM-Mroxy-6-oxo-<br><br>
tetrahydro-pyran-2-yl)-ethyl]-2-isopropyl~4-phenyl-lif'-pyrrole-3-carboxylicacid phenylamide. After 2 hours the reaction mixture is allowed to slowly cool to ambient temperature. The resulting slurry is cooled to ca. 0°C. The product is collected and washed with cold toluene (100 mL). The resulting solid is dissolved in hot toluene (350 mL) and cooled to 65°C where it is held for 2 hours. The reaction mixture is slowly cooled to ambient temperature and then to 0°C. The product is collected, washed with cold toluene (100 mL) and dried in vacuo at 70°C to afford 5-(4-fluorophenyl)-l-[2-((2R,4R)-4-hydroxy-6-oxo-tetrahydro~ pyran-2-yl)-ethylJ-2-isopropyl-4-phenyl-lif-pyrrole~3-carboxylicacid phenylamide as a white solid. m/z (DCI(w+I)) 541; calcd for C33H33FN2O4 540.24.<br>
Step 9: (R.R)-7-F2-f4-FluorophenvlV5-isopropyl-3-phenvl&gt;4-phenvlcarbamoyl-PYrrol-l-vl1-3,5-dihvdroxv-heptanoic acid, calcium salt.<br><br>
An argon-purged reactor is charged with 5-(4-fluorophenyl)-l-[2-((2R,4R)-4-hydroxy-6-oxo-tetrahydro-pyran-2-yl)-ethyl]-2-isopropyI-4-phenyl-lH-pyrrole-3-carboxylic acid phenylamide (14.8 mmol), MtBE (45 mL) and MeOH (20 mL). A solution of NaOH (15.2 mmol) in water (103 mL) is added and the reaction mixture heated to 52°C. After heating for ca. 1 hour, the reaction mixture is cooled to 34°C and the layers are allowed to separate. The upper organic layer is discarded. The lower aqueous layer is washed with MtBE (33 mL) at ca. 33°C. The lower aqueous layer is diluted with MtBE (2 mL) and heated to 52°C under argon. A warm solution of Ca(OAc)2-H20 (7.5 mmol) in water (44 mL) is added over ca. 1 hours. About 5 minutes aftet the start of the Ca(OAc)2 addition, the reaction mixture is seeded with a slurry of (R,R)-7-[2-(4-<br>
fluorophenyl)'5-isopropyl-3-phenyl-4-phenylcarbamoyl-pyrrol-l-yl]-3,5-<br><br>
dihydroxy-heptanoic acid, calcium salt (0.08 mmol) in water (1.2 mL) and methanol (0.4 mL). After the Ca(OAc&gt;2 addition is complete, the reaction mixture is held for ca. 15 minutes at 52°C and cooled to 20°C. The product is collected, washed sequentially with a 2:1 solution of aqueous methanol (48 mL) and water (49 mL). After drying in vacuo at 70°G, (R,R)-7-[2-(4-fluorophenyl)-5-isopropyl-3-phenyl-4-phenylcarbamoyl-pyrrol-1 -yl]-3,5-dihydroxy-heptanoic acid, calcium salt (8.7 g) is obtained as a white solid. The analytical specifications of this material are in agreement with the values reported in the prior art.<br>
