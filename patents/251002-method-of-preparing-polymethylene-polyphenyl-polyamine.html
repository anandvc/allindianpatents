				<td>Method of preparing polymethylene-polyphenyl-polyamine<br>
Technical field<br>
The present invention relates to a method of preparing polymethylene-polyphenyl-polyamine, particularly to a method of preparing polymethylene-polyphenyl-polyamine using a high gravity rotating bed as the mixing reactor for the reaction of formaldehyde and aniline hydrochloride.<br>
Technical background<br>
MDI (a mixture of diphenylmethylene diisocyanate and polymethylene polyphenyl isocyanate) is one of the main raw materials in the polyurethane industry. The MDI reacts with polyether polyalcohol or polyester polyalcohol, in the presence of catalyst, foaming agent and the like, to produce various polyurethane polymer materials which are used widely in the fields of polyurethane rigid- and semi-rigid foams plastics, of polyurethane products by reaction injection molding- or reinforced reaction injection molding process, as well as in the fields of heat insulation materials, synthetic fibers (urethane elastic fiber), binders and elastomers, etc.<br>
It is well-known in the polyurethane industry that a condensation reaction of aniline and formaldehyde is conducted in the presence of a hydrochloric acid catalyst to obtain firstly polymethylene-polyphenyl-polyamine, and a phosgenation reaction of polymethylene-polyphenyl-polyamine is then conducted to produce monomeric MDI and polymeric MDI.<br>
The condensation reaction of aniline and formaldehyde in the presence of a hydrochloric acid catalyst for obtaining polymethylene-polyphenyl-polyamine is one of the key steps in the MDI production process. If the formaldehyde and aniline can not be mixed at the molecular level in a short time, it may result in local excess of formaldehyde, thus by-products and net-like high polymers will be produced and the quality of the targeted polyamine will be affected. In addition, since the reaction mixture has a high viscosity and the raw materials flow in a laminar pattern, the mixing effect deteriorates accordingly, usually being accompanied with local overheating. Therefore, the by-products increase and the product quality fluctuates; in the worst situation, the pipes may be blocked and the reaction apparatus has to be shut down. The mixed state of formaldehyde with other raw materials is the key factor of the whole condensation reaction, in order to disperse formaldehyde in the reaction system rapidly and uniformly and avoid local excess. Up to now, the mixing/reaction apparatuses used in the production process are the mixing<br>
pump, the jet mixer, the dynamic mixer or the static mixer, etc.<br>
US6,720,455B2 describes two condensation reaction modes, one of which generally adopts a process of firstly reacting the aniline with hydrochloric acid to produce aniline hydrochloride, then mixing aniline hydrochloride and formaldehyde in a proper mixing mode and conducting a pre-condensation reaction by controlling the reaction temperature in between 30-80 H and controlling the residence time of the reaction materials in the reactor, and subsequently raising the temperature of reaction materials to 100-160 D by heating the condensation solution in a stepwise or continuous mode to conduct a molecular rearrangement reaction.<br>
Another reaction mode adopts the process of firstly mixing the aniline, and formaldehyde to make them react with each other by controlling the reaction temperature in between 60-85 C, then removing the water from the above reaction solution with phase separation or other process, such as rectification, and mixing the obtained intermediate products and hydrochloric acid catalyst with a proper mixing mode to conduct a condensation reaction by controlling the temperature at 30-80D. After the reaction was completed, the temperature was controlled at 100-160LI in a stepwise or continuous temperature rising mode to conduct a molecular rearrangement reaction. However, this prior patent does not disclose the specific mode or apparatus which was used to mix the raw materials.<br>
US6,673,970B1 describes a condensation process which can decrease or reduce impurities in DAM which may have impact on the color of the final MDI products, that is to say, the more the impurities is contained in DAM, the darker the color of MDI products is. In the process, the first step is to form aniline hydrochloride, the second step is to sufficiently form an intermediate aminobenzylaniline by adding the reactant formaldehyde gradually for controlling the reaction process; the third step is, in the molecular rearrangement process, to add about 70%-80% of stoichiometric amount of base to partially neutralize the reaction mixture.<br>
USP3,517,062 presents a process flow of continuous polyamines preparation. Aniline and hydrochloric acid form a salt in a CSTR (Continuous Stirred-Tank Reactor), which is introduced into another CSTR in which formaldehyde is fed continuously and the condensation reaction is conducted, then the reaction mixture is introduced into a tubular reactor to conduct the molecular rearrangement reaction.<br>
USP3,260,751 describes a continuous condensation process, in which the proposed flow condition of fluid is Re=4500-100000 to ensure a turbulent fluid condition, so that the formation of high molecular polymer may be inhibited and thus the blocking of apparatus may be avoided. If the materials can not be mixed sufficiently, the ratios of compositions of the raw materials may vary with local positions, and the desired product can not be obtained with satisfaction. Therefore, this patent proposes a L-type mixing device which consists of two stainless steel tubes having diameter of 1/4 inch. The aniline hydrochloride passes through the L-type device and is introduced tangentially into a formaldehyde feeding tube from the bottom of the L-type. The diameter of aperture is 1/32 inch and a jacket casing is provided outside the tube for cooling. If several nozzles are distributed on the tubular reactor to feed the materials in batch, a formation of turbulent flow can also be obtained.<br>
The main objects of these methods all relate to reduce the contents of impurities in polymethylene polyphenyl polyamines, so as to improve their performance in use of the MD1 products and, at the same time, to inhibit formation of substance having high molecular weight caused by non-uniform distribution of formaldehyde, and so as to avoid the deposition and blocking phenomenon on the inner walls of pipes and apparatus. However, it is impossible for these known methods to attain a fast and sufficient mixing of aniline and formaldehyde, especially when used in a large-scale continuous production process, the above-mentioned problems may well occur.<br>
High gravity technology is a novel technique which strengthens the mass transfer, heat transfer and the micro-mixing processes using a much higher gravity (referred to as "high gravity") than the earth gravity, and which is carried out by producing a simulative high gravity condition on earth through rotation. This technique can greatly improve the conversion rate and selectivity in reactions, significantly reduce the volume of reactors, simplify the process and flow pattern, obtain high efficiency and low power consumption, and reduce the pollutants discharge. As indicated in some studies and analyses, under a high gravity condition, the molecular diffusion between molecules of different sizes and the inter-phase mass transfer processes are much faster than that in a normal gravity field. When gas-liquid, liquid-liquid or liquid-solid two-phases flow towards each other and come into contact in a porous medium under a high gravity which is hundreds or even a thousand times higher than the earth gravity, an enormous shear force breaks the liquid into liquid films, liquid threads and liquid droplets of nano-scale and thus generate enormous and quick-renewed phase interfaces, so that the inter-phase mass transfer rate is<br>
improved by 1-3 order of magnitude than that the conventional tower devices could offer, and the micro-mixing and mass transfer process is improved greatly. Such kind of high gravity rotating bed device has been disclosed in the prior art. On the above basis, studies on practical application of high gravity technology have gained some important progresses and its application has been extended from the physical process, such as separation and desorption, into chemical reaction processes. However, up to now there is no report concerning the application of high gravity technology in condensation reaction for preparing polymethylene polyphenyl polyamines.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide a method of preparing polymethylene polyphenyl polyamines, which has the advantages of simple and stable operation, low impurity content in DAM and stable product quality.<br>
To attain'the above object, the inventive method comprises the following steps:<br>
a)	mixing aniline with hydrochloric acid and conducting a reaction to produce aniline<br>
hydrochloride;<br>
b)	introducing the aniline hydrochloride stream into circulation pipes and mixing it with a<br>
circulation solution coming from condensation stirred vessel, cooling the obtained mixed solution<br>
in a heat exchanger;<br>
c)	introducing the cooled solution and formaldehyde solution into a high gravity rotating bed<br>
reactor, in which mixing them and conducting a pre-condensation reaction;<br>
d)	introducing the materials discharged from the high gravity rotating bed reactor into the<br>
condensation   stirred   vessel   to   proceed   with   pre-condensation   reaction   and   molecular<br>
rearrangement reaction;  introducing a part of the  reaction mixture discharged from the<br>
condensation stirred vessel into the circulation pipes as circulation solution and discharging the<br>
other part as products.<br>
Hereinafter, the method of continuously preparing polymethylene polyphenyl polyamines according to the present invention is further explained; however, the present invention is not limited thereto in any way.<br>
In step a), aniline, as one of the reaction materials, is mixed firstly with catalyst hydrochloric acid. Aniline has weak alkalinity, and could conduct a neutralization reaction when mixing with hydrochloric acid. The reaction proceeds very fast and aniline hydrochloride is formed with a<br>
large amount of reaction heat evolved. The applicable mixing apparatus could be a mixing pump, a jet mixer, or a static mixer, etc. The reaction could be carried out in a tubular reactor or a stirred vessel reactor.<br>
In a preferable embodiment, aniline, as reaction material, is mixed with hydrochloric acid, as catalyst, in a venturi jet and completes therein the neutralization reaction. In the method according to the present invention, the molar ratio of hydrochloric acid to aniline in step a) is 0.05:1-0.9:1, preferably 0.2:1 -0.6:1, and more preferably 0.25:1 -0.5:1. Hydrochloric acid at the industrial-grade purity could be used for this purpose and the percentage concentration by weight of hydrochloric acid is preferably in the range of 30.1 %-31.4 wt%.<br>
In step b), the stream of produced aniline hydrochloride is introduced into the liquid phase circulation loop by a higher pressure head, provided by a transfer pump, than the pressure inside the liquid phase circulation pipes, so as to merge with a circulation solution stream coming from the condensation stirred vessel. The Re value (Re=du p/u., in which d is the tube diameter, u is the flow velocity, p is the density, and u is the viscosity) is larger than 5000, preferably larger than 7000, and more preferably larger than 9000. The aniline hydrochloride stream and the circulation stream are mixed uniformly in the pipes for a time of about 5-12 sec, and then introduced into the heat exchanger rapidly to remove the reaction heat. Wherein, the mixed solution after cooling in step b) has a temperature of 15-60D, preferably 20-50D, more preferably 30-45n; the heat exchanger used could be a wing-plate heat exchanger, a tubular heat exchanger or any other suitable heat exchanger for the process.<br>
In step c), the high gravity rotating bed reactor used is the most important mixing reaction apparatus in the method of preparing polymethylene polyphenyl polyamines according to the present invention; it could be, but is not limited to, the rotating packed bed type, zigzag type, helix channel type, rotor-stator type or ring disks type of high gravity rotating devices. In step c), the mixed solution after cooling and the formaldehyde solution could be introduced into the high gravity rotating bed reactor respectively, in proportion to each other, through their respective material distributors. When implementing the method according to the present invention, the rotating speed of the rotor in the high gravity rotating bed reactor is 100-3000rpm, preferably 300-2000rpm, and most preferably 450-1 SOOrpm.<br>
By reference, The detailed illustration about the characteristics of such high gravity rotating bed<br>
reactors could be found from the following technical literatures, such as, "The high gravity technology and its application - a new generation of reaction and separation technology", Jianfeng CHEN, et al, Chemical Industry Press, and the Chinese Patent Nos. 95107423.7, 92100093.6, 91109225.2 and 95105343.4. The relevant contents of these literatures are incorporated into the Description of the present application by reference.<br>
In step c), the formaldehyde solution and the mixed solution of aniline hydrochloride with circulation solution are mixed rapidly in the high gravity rotating bed reactor, resulting in a pre-condensation reaction. Wherein, the formaldehyde solution used in step c) could be an industrial-grade formaldehyde solution which has a percentage concentration by weight in a preferable range of 36.8-37.2 wt%; the molar ratio of formaldehyde to aniline is 0.1:1-0.8:1, preferably 0.2:1-0.65:1, and more preferably 0.3:1-0.55:1; the reaction temperature is controlled within 20-70D, preferably 30-65D, and more preferably 30-50D; and the reaction time is 0.5-10 sec, and preferably 0.5-5 sec.<br>
In step d), the pre-condensation reaction needs a comparatively short residence time, the average is 10-60 min, preferably 15-45 min, and particularly preferably 20-35 min. The reaction temperature for the continuous pre-condensation reaction in the condensation stirred vessel is 15-80n, preferably 20-70D, and more preferably 30-60D.<br>
Subsequently, the condensation solution is heated by a conventional method to conduct a molecular rearrangement reaction, finally form a solution of diphenylmethylene diamine hydrochloride and polymethylene-polyphenyl-polyamine hydrochloride. The volume flow ratio of the part, which is referred to as circulation solution, to the other part, which is the product, is 3:1 to 50:1, preferably 5:1 to 30:1, and more preferably 8:1 to 20:1. Then, the resultant product is further treated by the processes of neutralization, water washing and polyamine purification, etc. to obtain the refined DAM.<br>
To attain the object of the present invention, the reaction apparatus for implementing the above preparation method consists mainly of a condensation reaction vessel, a high gravity rotating bed reactor, a venturi jet, a liquid-phase circulation loop and a heat exchanger, etc. The key device is the high gravity rotating bed reactor.<br>
Over the prior art, the inventive method has the advantages as follows:<br>
The method according to the present invention reduces the impurities in DAM and avoids the deposition and blocking onto the tube wall and blockage of the tube pass of the heat exchanger mainly by strengthening the dispersion of formaldehyde in the reaction system, and the rapid and uniform dispersion of formaldehyde is achieved with a high gravity rotating bed reactor which is capable of mixing and dispersing the raw materials sufficiently and uniformly. To strengthen the mixing and condensation reaction process, the inventive method adopts a high gravity rotating bed reactor having a capability of enhancing the mass and heat transfer and micro-mixing process greatly, so as to attain the object of simplifying the previous synthesis process for polymethylene polyphenyl polyamines production.<br>
Due to the high speed rotation of the rotor in the high gravity rotating bed reactor, a stable high gravity condition is formed resulting in high gravity being tens or hundreds times higher than the normal earth gravity. With high dispersion, high turbulence, strong mixing and quick interface renewal of the raw materials in the rotating reaction channel, the reaction components get into contact at great relative speed, bringing about a greatly strengthened mass and heat transfer and the micro-mixing process between/among the reactants. Therefore, when the two streams of material pass through a rotating packing layer, formaldehyde and aniline can achieve a micro-mixing at a molecular level in a very short time.<br>
After the high gravity mixer is used in the pre-condensation reaction system, the impurities content in DAM (such as, N-methyl compounds, the same below) is still low when the temperature of pre-condensation vessel is controlled at about SOD, normally being kept around 0.1% (a result from gas chromatography, the same below). While in the prior art reaction process using a jet mixer, the content of the impurities in DAM, such as N-methyl compounds, is about 0.15% at 35 D. This shows that the inventive method can obtain the DAM of high quality, even though being operated at a higher reaction temperature. With a higher reaction temperature, the whole pre-condensation reaction system could be operated with wider flexibility, and the consumption of circulation water for cooling is reduced, so that power cost is decreased.<br>
The inventive method can guarantee the mixing magnitude as required by the reaction system, so as to attain rapid and uniform dispersion of the reactants with each other, thus the reactant ratio, i.e. the ratio, of aniline/formaldehyde, may be higher. The high gravity mixing is advantageous for a production with a higher formaldehyde proportion, while according to the previous process, the<br>
product quality is bad and even blockage happens when a higher formaldehyde proportion is used. In the inventive method, when the ratio of aniline/formaldehyde is about 1:0.49, the impurities content in DAM is about 0.23%; while with the prior art reaction process using a jet mixer, when the ratio of aniline/formaldehyde is increased to about 1:0.49, the operation of reaction system is unstable and the tubes are likely to be blocked by solid impurities formed due to the non-uniform dispersion of formaldehyde. As a result, the operation is abnormal; moreover, the impurities content in DAM is high, up to about 0.42%.<br>
By examining the inventive method and the prior art reaction process using a jet mixer and analyzing comparatively their pre-condensation solutions, it is found that, when the reaction temperature in the inventive method is controlled at 3 6-40 D, the content of 4,4'-MDA in the reaction solution is about 11-14% which is obviously higher than the content of 4,4'-MDA in the reaction solution (about 4-6%) in the prior art reaction process using a jet mixer. This indicates an obvious acceleration in the whole course of the condensation reaction, and the reaction process is strengthened.<br>
The method according to the present invention can improve the reactor efficiency and shorten the residence time of materials in the condensation reaction vessel. Meanwhile, the condensation reaction process is obviously accelerated, the main by-products is obviously less formed in the condensation process, the viscosity of condensation solution is decreased, the phenomena of deposit attachment onto the inner walls of circulation pipes and of heat exchanger and blocking thereof are prevented in the condensation process, the impurity content is low in the refined DAM, and the subsequent product MDI has a lighter color, the product quality is stable and is improved to a certain extent.<br>
