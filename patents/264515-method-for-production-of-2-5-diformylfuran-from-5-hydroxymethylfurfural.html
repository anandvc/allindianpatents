FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention related to a method for producing 2,5-diformylfuran (DFF) by oxidation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural by utilizing heterogeneous ICaT-4 catalyst. This process is very economical as it involved high yield and excellent selectivity for DFF without using an expensive catalyst and with reduced energy consumption.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Chemicals derived from biomass feedstock are bringing the world on a sustainable platform. Carbohydrate feedstock has a remarkable opportunity to act as a future renewable biomass resource for substituting petroleum feedstock. 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) obtained from carbohydrate serve as a prospective building block.<br>
Oxidation of HMF gives products such as 2,5-diformylfuran (DFF), hydroxymethyl furan carboxylic acid (HMFCA), formylfuran carboxylic acid (FFCA) and furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA). 2,5-diformylfuran (DFF) is a versatile compound, and there are several reports describing its useful application as monomer, as pharmaceutical intermediates, nematocides, antifungal agents, ligands, in photography as cross-linking agent for poly (vinyl alcohol), for battery separators, as a foundry sand binders, for metal electroplating, in electro optical devices, as organic phosphors and luminophores and for preparing new polymeric materials for specific application.<br>
Several methods have been utilized for preparation of DFF from 5-hydroxymethylfurfural but most of the method end with mixture of oxidative products and results in low product<br><br>
selectivity and low yield. Hence it is desirable to develop alternative method for production of 2,5-diformylfuran from 5-hydroxymethylfurfural.<br>

This invention also relates to polymerization of the dialdehyde and to the decarbonylation of the dialdehyde to unsubstituted furan. However, the yields were not very high, including the corrosive nature of the system as a major disadvantage.<br>
US 2003130528 discloses the process for preparation of 2,5-diformylfuran from source of fructose in a one-pot, two-step reaction by using vanadium catalyst. In this process initially 5-hydroxymethylfurfural is formed by reacting fructose source with cation exchange resin then without isolating it is oxidized by using vanadium catalyst in presence of oxidant such as air or oxygen.<br>
US 2006128843 discloses the method of reduction of 2,5-(hydroxymethyl)furaldehyde to 2,5-(hydroxymethyl) tetrahydrofuran and 2,5-bis(hydroxymethyl)tetrahydrofuran by reacting with the catalyst comprising of nickel and zirconium with particular pressure and temperature.<br>

with different vanadium loadings, and in toluene and methyl isobutyl ketone as the solvents. The catalyst is not recyclable and yield is low.<br>
According to the process in Catalysis Communication 9 (2008) 268-288; 5-hydroxymethylfurfural is oxidized to 2,5-diformylfuran by using Mn(III)-salen catalysts and sodium hypoclorite, in pH 11.3 phosphate buffer-CH2Cl2 biphasic system. It gave 63-89% yield, but the reaction was sluggish taking 24 h<br>
According to the process in Applied Catalysis A: General 289 (2005) 197-204; the selective oxidation of 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furaldehyde to furan-2,5-dicarboxaldehyde by catalytic systems based on vanadyl phosphate and oxidizing agent are air or oxygen and dimethylformamide is used as solvent. The use of the solvent such as DMF caused many problems in term of environmental impact, recovery and DFF purification.<br>
There are many reports available for preparation of DFF by oxidation of HMF using various classical oxidants but it was required in stoichiometric quantity such as CrCv pyridine, barium manganate, pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC), Pb(OAc)4-pyridine, K2Cr207-DMSO, 2,2,6,6-teramethylpiperidine-l-oxide (TEMPO), trimethylarnmonium chlorochromate.<br>
This invention deals with the process for oxidation of HMF to DFF by using ICaT-4 as oxidizing catalysts in presence of air as oxidant. The product selectivity was 100 %, catalyst is highly reusable. As no process available at industrial scale thus, this process is suitable for a further industrial exploration.<br>

EXAMPLE 20-23:<br>
All the reactions are carried out in batch mode operation by using 100 cm3 autoclave reactor. The reaction is performed by loading autoclave reactor with specific amount of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), 40 ml of isopropyl alcohol. The ICaT-4 catalyst (0.0075 g/cm ) is added to the reaction mixture. Air is charged up to 15 arm pressure. Reaction mixture is agitated with a four bladed pitch turbine impeller. The reaction temperature is maintained at 145 C with an accuracy of + 1 °C by PID controller. Concentration of HMF is varied in these examples (mentioned in Table 5). Through out the reaction, air pressure was maintained constant by a mass flow controller. The progress of the reaction is monitor on HPLC by using UV detector. Calibration curve method is adopted for calculating percentage conversion and percentage yield quantitatively. The selectivity of DFF is 100% in all the cases. The different amount of HMF is used in these examples to evaluate its effect on conversion and yield (Drawing 4).<br><br>

EXAMPLE 24-28:<br>
All the reactions are carried out in batch mode operation by using 100 cm3 autoclave reactor. The reaction is performed by loading autoclave reactor with 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) (0.0025 mol), 40 ml of isopropyl alcohol. Specific amount of the ICaT-4 catalyst (0.0075 g/cm3), is added to the reaction mixture. Air is charged up to 15 atm pressure. Reaction mixture is agitated with a four bladed pitch turbine impeller.

The selectivity of DFF is 100% in all the cases. The reusability of the catalyst is tested by conducting five runs. After completion of the reaction, the catalyst is filtered and washed with IP A. Then it is calcined at 400 °C for 2 hrs. The reusability of the catalyst is mentioned in these examples (Table 6).<br><br>

EXAMPLE 29:<br>
The isolation and purification of 2,5-diformylfuran (DFF) is carried out by a process selected from the group consisting of filtration, evaporation, extraction, distillation and sublimation. Reaction mass is filtered through filter paper to remove solid heterogeneous ICaT-4 catalyst. Catalyst was washed with 50 cm3 of IPA. Reaction mass is distilled under reduced pressure to remove IPA and then DFF is extracted with organic solvent such as ethyl acetate, dietbylether, methyl isobutyl ketone, dichloromethane, methyl-tertiary-butyl ether, butyl acetate. Organic layer is dried by using sodium sulfate and distilled under reduced pressure to get pure DFF. Further purification is done by vacuum sublimation.<br><br>
