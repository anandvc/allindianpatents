				<td>SIZING COMPOSITIONS AND GLASS FIBER REINFORCED THERMOPLASTIC<br>
COMPOSITES<br>
RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
The present application hereby claims priority under 35 U.S.C. § 119(e) to United<br>
States Provisional Patent Application Serial Number 60/875,206 filed December 15, 2006,<br>
which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to sizing compositions, glass fibers at least partially<br>
coated with sizing compositions, and glass fiber reinforced composite materials.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Glass fibers are typically treated after forming with a sizing composition that can<br>
impart desired properties. As used herein the term "size", "sized", "sizing" and "sizing<br>
composition" means a coating composition that can be applied to the glass fibers after<br>
formation of the fibers. After their formation and treatment, ihe sized glass fibers can be<br>
gathered into bundles or strands comprising a plurality of individual fibers.<br>
A sizing composition can serve several functions: A sizing composition, for example,<br>
can serve as a lubricant, protecting fibers from abrasion with one another. A sizing<br>
composition ean also function (o enhance compatibility of glass fibers with the thermoplastic<br>
resins they reinforce.<br>
Many glass fiber reinforced thermoplastic resins are used in the automotive industry.<br>
Glass fiber reinforced polyamide resins, for example, are often used to fabricate containers<br>
for various automotive fluids such as oil pans and radiatOT parts that encapsulate the core of<br>
the radiator. In recent years, manufacturing techniques have been developed to produce<br>
thermoplastic resins reinforced wiih long glass fibers. Processes such as G-LFT (Granular-<br>
Long Fiber Technology) and D-LFT (Direct-Long Fiber Technology) reinforce thermoplastic<br>
resins with fibers that maintain a sufficient length resulting in products wiih desirable<br>
mechanical properties and durability. Reinforcing thermoplastics with long glass fibers,<br>
however, presents several challenges including maintaining glass filament length and certain<br>
integrity during compounding or pultmsion processes while aehieving sufficient wetting of<br>
the long fibers with thermoplastic resin, and others.<br>
Moreover, once a long fiber thermoplastic (LFT) composite has been produced,<br>
certain end uses of the composite can involve exposure to harsh physical and chemieal<br>
conditions that can lead to degradation of the composite through various pathways. The<br><br>
combination of high temperatures and exposure lo aqueous organic solvent mixtures such as<br>
ethylene glycol and water, for example, can decrease the strength of some fiber reinforced<br>
polyamide resins.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
For the purposes of this specification, unless otherwise indicated, all numbers<br>
expressing quantities of ingredients, reaction conditions, and so forth used in the specification<br>
are to be understood as being modified in all instances by the term "about." Accordingly,<br>
unless indicated to the contrary, the numerical parameters set forth in the following<br>
specification are approximations that may vary depending upon the desired properties sought<br>
to be obtained by the present invention. At the very least, and not as an attempt to limit the<br>
application of the doctrine of equivalents to the scope of the claims, each numerical<br>
parameter should at least be construed in light of the number of reported significant digits and<br>
by applying ordinary rounding techniques.<br>
Notwithstanding that the numerical ranges and parameters setting forth the broad<br>
scope of the invention are approximations, the numerical values set forth in the specific<br>
examples are reported as precisely as possible. Any numerical value, however, inherently<br>
eontains certain errors necessarily resulting from the standard deviation found in their<br>
respective testing measurements.<br>
It is further noted that, as used in this specification, the singular forms "a," "an," and<br>
"the" include plural referents unless expressly and unequivocally limited to one referent.<br>
In some embodiments, sizing compositions of the present invention comprise at least<br>
one maleic anhydride copolymer, at least one coupling agent, and a reaction product of an<br>
alkoxylated amine and poiycarboxylic acid, which is further reacted with an epoxy<br>
compound.<br>
In some embodiments, Ihe reaction product of an alkoxylated amine and a<br>
poiycarboxylic acid, which is further reacted with an epoxy compound is present in an<br>
amount greater than about 40 weight percent of the sizing composition on a total solids basis.<br>
In another embodiment, the reaction product of an alkoxylated amine and a poiycarboxylic<br>
acid, which is further reacted with an epoxy compound is present in an amount greater than<br><br>
about SO weight percent of the sizing composition on a total solids basis. In some<br>
embodiments, the reaction product of an alkoxylated amine and a polycarboxylic acid, which<br>
is further reacted with an epoxy compound is present in an amount greater than about 70<br>
weight percent on a total solids basis.<br>
In some embodiments, a sizing composition of the present invention further comprises<br>
at least one additional component comprising a polyester, polyvinyl alcohol, polyurethane,<br>
polyvinylpyrrolidone, fatty aeid ester of a polyethylene glycol, acrylic, wax, ehemically<br>
modified rosin, or epoxide.<br>
Turning now to components that can be included in varying embodiments of sizing<br>
compositions of the present invention, a sizing composition of the present invention can<br>
comprise at least one maleic anhydride copolymer. In some embodiments, the maleic<br>
anhydride copolymer comprises maleic anhydride monomer and monomer selected from the<br>
group consisting of ethylene, butadiene, isobutylene, and mixtures thereof. In other<br>
embodiments, the maleic anhydride copolymer comprises maleic anhydride monomer and<br>
monomer selected from the group consisting of ethylene, butadiene, and mixtures thereof   In<br>
further embodiments, the maleic anhydride copolymer comprises maleic anhydride monomer<br>
and isobuiylene.<br>
In some embodiments, the maleic anhydride copolymer comprises maleic anhydride<br>
monomer and copolymerizable monomer, wherein a portion of the maleic anhydride<br>
copolymer is chemically modified by ammonia or a primary alkyl amine. In other<br>
embodiments, the maleic anhydride copolymer comprises maleie anhydride monomer and<br>
copolymerizable monomer, wherein a portion of the maleic anhydride copolymer is<br>
chemically modified by ammonia. In another embodiment, the maleic anhydride copolymer<br>
comprises maleic anhydride monomer and copolymerizable monomer, wherein (he maleic<br>
anhydride copolymer is chemically modified by a primary alkyl amine. Moreover,<br>
chemically modifying a portion of the maleic anhydride copolymer with ammonia can<br>
convert a portion of the maleic anhydride monomers to maleimide monomers. Chemically<br>
modifying a portion of the maleic anhydride copolymer with a primary alkyl amine can<br>
convert a portion of the maleic anhydride monomers to alkyl substituted maleimide<br>
monomers.<br>
In another embodiment, the maleic anhydride copolymer comprises maleic anhydride<br>
monomer, copolymerizable monomer, and monomer selected from the group consisting of<br>
maleimide monomer, alkyl substituted maleimide monomer, and mixtures thereof. In some<br>
embodiments, the maleic anhydride copolymer comprises maleic anhydride monomer,<br><br>
copolymerizablc monomer, and maleimide monomer. In other embodiments, the maleic<br>
anhydride copolymer comprises maleic anhydride monomer, copolymerizable monomer, and<br>
alkyl substituted maleimide monomer.<br>
As used herein, the term "maleic anhydride monomer" includes maleic anhydride and<br>
maleic acid in the free acid, salt, or partial salt form. As used herein, the term "partial salt"<br>
refers to maleic anhydride monomers having two carboxy groups where one carboxy group is<br>
in the free acid form and one carboxy group is converted to a salt. As used herein, the term<br>
"maleimide monomer" includes maleimide, maleic diamide, and maleic acid amide in the<br>
free acid or salt form. As used herein, the term "alkyl substituted maleimide monomer"<br>
includes N-alkyl maleimide, N,N'-dialkyi maleic diamide, and N-alkyl maleic acid amide in<br>
the free acid or salt form.<br>
The maleie anhydride copolymer, in some embodiments, is formed from the<br>
polymerization of maleic anhydride or malcic acid with a copolymerizable monomer such as,<br>
but not limited to, ethylene, butadiene, isobutylene, and isobutylene. As previously<br>
described, the maleic anhydride copolymer, in some embodiments, can also include<br>
terpolymers comprising maleic anhydride monomer, copolymerizable monomers, and<br>
monomer selected from the group consisting of maleimide monomer, alkyl substituted<br>
maleimide monomer, and mixtures thereof. The ratio of monomers in the maleic anhydride<br>
copolymer is not particularly limited, so long as the maleic anhydride copolymer is operable<br>
to maintain or improve the hydrolysis resistance and/or strength of a reinforced thermoplastic<br>
resin. In embodiments where the maleic anhydride copolymer is formed from a reaction<br>
mixture comprising maleic anhydride and a copolymerizable monomer, the resulting maleic<br>
anhydride copolymer can be in many instances an alternating copolymcr of the two reaclants.<br>
Further chemical modification of the alternating maleic anhydride copolymer, in some<br>
embodiments, produees maleic anhydride copolymers where the ratio of maleic anhydride,<br>
maleimide, and N-substitutcd maleimide monomers to a copolymerizable monomer is 1:1.<br>
An aqueous solution of the maleic anhydride copolymer may be used when<br>
formulating some embodiments of sizing compositions of the present invention. For maleic<br>
anhydride copolymers having maleic anhydride monomers in the anhydride form, Ihe maleic<br>
anhydride copolymer may be poorly soluble when dispersed in water at room temperature.<br>
The solubility of the maleic anhydride copolymer can be improved by heating an aqueous<br>
solution of the maleic anhydride copolymer and converting anhydride groups of the maleie<br>
anhydride copolymer to the corresponding polyacids. The aqueous solution formed by the<br>
hydrolysis may then be used to formulate the sizing composition.<br><br>
Upon hydrolysis, free acid groups of the maleic anhydride copolymer can be further<br>
converted from the free acid to a salt. In an alternate method of preparing an aqueous<br>
solution of the maleic anhydride copolymer, maleic anhydride copolymers having maleic<br>
anhydride monomers in the anhydride form can be healed in an aqueous solution of<br>
ammonium hydroxide or an aqueous solution of a primary alkyl amine. The reaction mixture<br>
may be heated under pressure to temperatures above 100°C. Depending on the reaction<br>
conditions and whether ammonium hydroxide or a primary alkyl amine is present, some or all<br>
of the anhydride groups may be converted lo polyacids, salts, partial salts, diamides, partial<br>
amides, imides, and mixtures thereof.<br>
Formation of diamides, partial amides, and imides in the maleic anhydride eopoiymer,<br>
in some embodiments, imparts advantageous properties to fiber reinforced polyamides,<br>
Formation of these functionalities may provide maleic anhydride copolymers an affinity for<br>
reacting with the amine-terminal group of a polyamide resin through a transamidation<br>
reaction mechanism.<br>
A salt of the hydro lyzed maleic anhydride may be that of alkali meial or ammonium<br>
salts either derived from ammonium hydroxide or from an organic primary, secondary or<br>
tertiary amine poly- or monofunctionalized, e.g. triethylamine and triethanolamine. The<br>
degree of neutralization of the hydrolyzed maleic anhydride can vary. In an embodiment, a<br>
maleic anhydride copolymer is neutralized with a 25% ammonium hydroxide aqueous<br>
solution.<br>
As used herein, the term "copolymerizable monomer" refers to materials that can be<br>
copolymerized with maleic anhydride and include, but ace not limited to, aliphatic olefins,<br>
vinyl ethers, vinyl ace tales, and other vinyl type monomers. The copolymerizable aliphatic<br>
olefins are of the general formula (I):<br><br>
wherein R1 and R2 are each independently seleeted from the group consisting of hydrogen,<br>
alkyl, and alkenyl groups having from 1 to 12 carbon atoms. Examples of aliphatic olefins<br>
suitable for copolymerizing with maleic anhydride are ethylene, butadiene, and isoburylene.<br>
An example of a vinyl ether suitable for copolymerizing with maleic anhydride is<br>
isobutylene.<br><br>
The amount and type of maleimide monomer or N-subslituted maleimide monomer in<br>
the maleic anhydride copolymer, in some embodiments, is determined by considerations such<br>
as a desired reactivity of the maleie anhydride copolymer with a particular thermoplastic<br>
resin, such as a polyamide resin, or a desired viscosity for the sizing composition. A greater<br>
number of amide orimide groups in a maleic anhydride copolymer, for example, may<br>
increase the reactivity of the maleic anhydride copoiymer with the amino terminal groups of a<br>
polyamide resin. Further, a greater number of amide or imide groups in a maleic anhydride<br>
copolymer may reduce the solubility of Ihe maleic anhydride copolymer in aqueous solution.<br>
Acid derivatives such as esters may not provide acceptable reactivity with a polyamide resin<br>
relative to amides, imides, anhydrides, free acids, and salts.<br>
In an embodiment, the maleic anhydride copolymer is an alternating copolymer of<br>
maleic anhydride monomer and ethylene. An alternating copolymer of maleic anhydride and<br>
eihylene can be purchased from Zeeland Chemicals, Inc. In another embodiment, the maleie<br>
anhydride copolymer is an alternating copolymer of maleic anhydride monomer and<br>
butadiene. An alternating copolymer of maleic anhydride and butadiene known as<br>

materials in one step from raw materials. Continuous strands of glass fibers, for example, are<br>
provided and drawn into an extruder for compounding with plasticized polymer resin in a<br>
manner that prevents significant reduction in the lengths of the strands. Alternatively,<br>
chopped strands of glass fibers can also be provided and introduced into an extruder for<br>
compounding wilh plasticized polymer resin. The hot compound is subsequently fed in-line<br>
into a compression or injection molding apparatus for the production of molded articles.<br>
