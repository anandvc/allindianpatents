				<td>PREPARATION METHOD OF VALIENAMINE FROM ACARBOSE AND/OR<br>
ACARBOSE DERIVATIVES USING TRIFLUOROACETIC ACID<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a method of producing valienamine and, more<br>
particularly, to a method of producing valienamine at a substantially high conversion rate<br>
by mass producing valienamine by way of selective hydrolysis by using TFA from<br>
acarbose and/or acarbose derivatives, and then removing therefrom its by-products, i.e.,<br>
monosaccharide, disaccharide, and trisaccharide.<br>
Background Art<br>
The conventional art relating to commercial production of valienamine can be divided<br>
into two types. The first type relates to a method of direction production of valienamine<br>
by using microorganism fermentation, and the second type relates to a method of<br>
production of validamycin, a derivative of valienamine, by degradation by using other<br>
microorganisms.<br>
Validamycin derivatives basically include a valienamine moiety, which selectively<br>
binds with validamine or valiolamine. Moreover, a validamycin derivative is a<br>
pseudorrisaccharide compound, which is glucose bonded in chain.<br>
The validamycin compound is an antibiotic used for germicide for rice-cultivated land<br>
in East Asia, which is produced among other methods by culturing Streptomyces<br>
hygroscopicus, a soil microorganism. Here, the validamycin compound contains a small<br>
amount of intermediate valienamine, which is then separated out via a column.<br>
As for another method for producing valienamine, mere is a method of separating<br>
validamycin by using a microorganism, F saccharophilum, etc. The method involves<br>
using validamycin as a substrate or medium and adding it to the liquid mixed with<br>
microorganisms; culturing them for a certain period of time and then inducing separation<br>
of validamycin by microorganisms; and then obtaining validamycin by separation via a<br>
column. Yet, the two methods have disadvantages in that they take too much time for<br>
microorganism fermentation with not much higher yield.<br>
Another compound which has a valienamine moiety is acarbose. Acarbose is<br>
obtained from secondary metabolic products of Actinoplanes sp., which is one type of soil<br>
microorganisms. It is currently being used as a treatment for diabetes since it has<br>
inhibition effects on a -amylase. However, as of yet, there is no disclosure of the<br>
process of commercial or mass production of valienamine by using acarbose as a raw<br>
material.<br>
As for methods of producing valienamine, reported in academia, there is a chemical<br>
method of producing valienamine by using N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) with validamycin<br>
as raw material. However, as this method uses dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as solvent, it<br>
suffers from difficulties during purification and separation processes of byproducts, in<br>
addition to its low yield. Moreover, there is an ongoing research into the production<br>
method of valienamine using organic and inorganic acid, such as sulfuric acid,<br>
hydrochloric acid, and acetic acid. Yet, the method is not practical since it is limited to<br>
the extent of hydrolysis of only one terminal saccharide. Moreover, there was an attempt<br>
to produce valienamine by way of organic synthesis, but it currently is in a standstill due<br>
to the inefficiency of purification and organic synthesis processes.<br>
There is a production method of valienamine by pre-synthesis by enzyme, which is<br>
being actively pursued in recent years. This is a method of producing valienamine by<br>
using an inexpensive substrate by finding valienamine synthesis and related enzymes<br>
expressed by a strain. However, there are many difficulties, such as determination of the<br>
degree of activity and the expression according to a gene probe. So, the current<br>
production is rather difficult.<br>
As stated above, the production of valienamine in vitro by purification enzymes or<br>
chemicals has not yet been commercialized, and so up to now, valienamine has been<br>
mainly synthesized and produced by hydrolyzing validoxylamine and validamycin by<br>
using the strains, Pseudomonas denitrificans and Flavobacierium sacchawphilum.<br>
Japanese Patent No. 57,054,593 discloses a reaction of converting validoxylainine and<br>
validamycin by using microorganisms. This is a method of synthesizing and producing<br>
valienamine by using Flavobacterium saccharophilum by reacting of 1-5wt% mixture of<br>
validoxylamine and validamycin for 24-200 hours at reaction conditions of 20-45 ºC and<br>
pH 5-8.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention purports to provide a method of producing valienamine a: a<br>
substantially high conversion rate by first mass producing valienamine through selective<br>
hydrolysis from acarbose and/or acarbose derivatives by using TFA, and then removing<br>
byproducts, i.e., monosaccharide, disaccharide, and trisaccharide.<br>
To achieve said objectives, the present invention involves a method of producing<br>
valienamine from acarbose and/or acarbose derivatives by using trifluoroacetic acid (TFA).<br>
In particular, the present invention provides a method of producing valienamine by using<br>
a reaction substrate of final concentration of 0.2-10% acarbose and/or acarbose<br>
derivatives, and a reaction solvent of 10-60% TFA solution.<br>
If the final concentration of acarbose and/or its derivatives is less than 0.2%, or that<br>
of TFA exceeds 60%, the production cost per unit increases. On the other hand, if the<br>
final concentration of acarbose and/or its derivatives exceeds 10%, or that of TFA is less<br>
than 10%, the yield therein decreases.<br>
Moreover, the present invention provides a method of producing valienamine<br>
from acarbose and/or acarbose derivatives by using TFA, which is characterized<br>
by reacting it for 1~24 hours at 80~120°C, or by using a high-temperature of<br>
150° to 450°C and high-pressure of upto 5 atm autoclave, which can reduce<br>
reaction rime to one hour and increase its yield up to 96%.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention can yield valienamine with an amine group<br>
of NH2 or NH3 at its carbon chain.<br>
Moreover, according to the present invention, an acarbose derivative is a compound<br>
having one, two, four, five or more saccharides bonded to a carbon chain, but generally<br>
refers to a derivative of one or two saccharides.<br>
Valienamine is known to have maltase and sucrase inhibition effects and to have<br>
antibiotic activity as against Bacillus species. Moreover, its intramolecular atom<br>
alignment is similar to that of alpha-D-glucose. The inhibition activity of alpha-<br>
glucosidase of valienamine is believed to be caused by structural similarity of valienamine<br>
to D-glucosyl cation. The D-glucosyl cation with an enzyme as a catalyst forms a half-<br>
chair conformation in a transition state, which is produced during hydrolysis of<br>
pyranoside.<br>
As for compounds with a valienamine moiety, there are acarbose, its derivatives,<br>
validoxylamine, validamycin, etc. Among these, acarbose is being widely used as an<br>
inhibitor for Type II diabetics. Acarbose and acarbose derivatives have different<br>
structures from the other two compounds (validoxylamine and validamycin), and their<br>
productiou methods are substantially different as well.<br>
Compounds with a valienamine moiety, i.e., acarbose, its derivatives, validoxylamine,<br>
and validamycin, are all potentially raw materials for valienamine. All of them are<br>
produced by fermentation by different bacteria strains, respectively. Among these,<br>
acarbose is being distributed as a diabetic treatment all over the world by a German<br>
pharmaceutical company, Bayer, Inc., along with Chinese and Japanese pharmaceutical<br>
companies. Acarbose is more expensive than validamycin but is easier to obtain in a<br>
pure raw material form. Accordingly, acarbose has the advantage of easy separation<br>
process, which makes it an appropriate raw material for valienamine. When using<br>
acarbose as a raw material, there is a problem of difficult purification by way of pigments<br>
from cleaved saccharide, but this can be easily resolved by using acarbose derivatives.<br>

Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiment<br>
Example 1: Method of producing valienamine using TFA<br>
10g of pure acarbose were place into 10% TFA solution at 5% final concentration.<br>
At reaction temperature of 100ºD, it was reacted for 12 hours or more, followed by<br>
removal of TFA and water. Then, by using ion-exchange resins for purification, 2.02g of<br>
valienamine were obtained.<br>
Example 2: Method of producing valienamine using TFA<br>
1g of a pure acarbose derivative (monosaccharide and trisaccharide) were place into<br>
10% TFA solution at 5% final concentration. At reation temperature of 1000ºC, it was<br>
reacted for 12 hours or more, followed by removal of TFA and water. Then, by using<br>
ion-exchange resin, for purification, 0.45g and 0.31g of valienamine were obtained,<br>
respectively.<br>
Example 3: Method of product valienamine using TFA by using an autoclave<br>
10g of pure acarbose were place into 10% TFA solution a, 5% final concentration.<br>
While putting pressure using an autoclave, at reaction temperature of 121°C, it was<br>
reacted for 30 minutes to 1 hour, followed by removal of TFA and water. Then, by using<br>
ion-exchange resins for purification, 2.1g of valienamine were obtained.<br>
Example 4: Method of producing valienamine using TFA by using an autoclave<br>
1g of a pure acarbose derivative (monosaccharide and trisaccharide) were place into<br>
10% TFA solution at 5% final concentration. While putting pressure using an autoclave,<br>
at reaction temperature of 121ºC, it was reacted for 30 minutes to 1 hour, followed by<br>
removal of TFA and water. Then, by using ion-exchange resins for purification, 0.46g<br>
and 0.30g of valienamine were obtained, respectively.<br>
The hydrogen and carbon NMR spectrums with respect to the resultant products<br>
obtained as a result of the reactions of Examples 1 and 2 are as follows: 1H-NMR(D2O)<br>
6: 3.42(1H, br s, H-1), 3.54(2H, Abq, J=13.6Hz, H-7), 3.94(1H, d, J=6.79Hz),<br>
3.97(1H), 4.05(lH), 5.64(1H, d, J=4.6) 13C-NMR(D2O) d : 48.9(C-1), 61.2(C-7),<br>
69.7(C-2), 71.7(C-4), 72.0(C-3), 123.4(C-6), 139.9(C-5).<br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
By using the method of the present invention, valienamine can be produced from<br>
acarbose with yield rate of 50~95%, and/or acarbose derivatives with yield rate of<br>
70~95%. Since hydrolysis is occurred on the a-binding adjacent to the amine moiety of<br>
valienamine, only monosaccharide, disaccharide or trisaccharide are produced as<br>
byproducts. Due to this advantage, the refining process becomes simple making it<br>
possible to produce valienamine with high purity while reducing the pigments.<br>
In addition, by using the method of the present invention, the voglibose, which is<br>
widely sold as a remedial agent of diabetes over the world including Korea, Japan and<br>
China, can be more easily produced cutting down the production cost. Also the<br>
invention can contribute to the development of valienamine derivatives which have better<br>
pharmaceutical activity, or which can be used on other types of disease.<br>
