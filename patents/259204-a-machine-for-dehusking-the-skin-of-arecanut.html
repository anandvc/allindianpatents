				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention in general relates to an automatic machine for peeling the skin of fruits. More specifically the present invention relates to an automatic machine for peeling the skin of Areca nut.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Areca nut is grown in the western ghats of Karnataka (India) and in some of the East Asian countries like Malaysia and to lesser extent in China. This is also one of the commercial crops of South India. Areca nut is mainly used in paw beeda, gutka, pan masala and also exported to south Asian countries like Pakistan, Bangladesh etc. Traditionally the outer cover of areca nut is manually removed before it is processed, which very labor intensive and time consuming. Machines are available in the market for peeling the skin of the areca nut. However, each one of these machines suffers from one or more of the following disadvantages.<br>
The prior art machines do not have the facilities like the auto-feeding, separator, and self-adjustment mode. Some machines can peel only a particular variety of areca nut and some machines can peel only a particular size of areca nut.<br>
For the foregoing reasons, there is a need for a machine that has the ability to auto- feed, automatically separate the areca nuts and the peeled skins, the ability to peel various varieties of areca nut without causing damage to the nuts, self-adjustment mode to reduce the rejection rate of un-peeled nuts, and the ability to peel areca nuts of different sizes.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
The present invention is directed to a machine that has the ability to auto-feed, peel various varieties and sizes of areca nut without causing damage to the nuts, separate the nuts from the peeled skin or husk that come out together and self- adjust to reduce the rejection rate of un-peeled nuts.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides an automatic machine for peeling the skin/husk of areca nut comprising of; an aluminium wheel, one or more blades, a skin/husk separator, a nylon brush, a conveyer chain, a tub and a nurling shaft; mounted in a hollow outer casing having an inlet for feeding areca nuts in the front side, a nut delivery outlet on the side and an outlet for the skin or husk on the back side.<br>
The present invention relates to an areca peeling arrangement, and has for its primary object the construction of a machine that will peel areca nuts in a more efficient manner and in a more economical manner to the extent that a variety of shapes and sizes can be peeled.<br>
Another object of the invention is the construction of a machine having a greater output than similar machines now on the market with additional advantage that there are no restrictions as to the size, shape or variety of areca nut that can be peeled.<br>
Still another object of this invention is to provide a nut peeling arrangement that may be readily adjusted to accommodate shelled nuts of various grades, sizes and skin thicknesses.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide an automatic machine for peeling the skin of areca nut irrespective of hardness of inner core of the areca nut.<br>
Further object of the present invention is to provide an automatic machine for peeling the skin of areca nut which can be continuously used.<br>
Still another further object of the present invention is to provide an automatic machine for peeling the skin of areca nut which is very less time consuming and less labor intensive as compared to the known art.<br>
Yet another further object of the present invention is to provide an automatic machine for peeling the skin of areca nut which consumes less electricity.<br>
At the outset of the description that follows, it is to be understood that the ensuing description only illustrates a particular form of this invention. However, such a particular form is only an exemplary embodiment and is not intended to be taken restrictively to imply any limitation on the scope of the present invention.<br>
In accordance with a preferred embodiment thereof, a nut peeling arrangement is disclosed in which the nuts to be peeled are fed into the inlet and the nuts come out peeled and separated from the skin. The invention is particularly characterized by the fact that the nut is individually forced into contact with the blade, which removes the skin from the nut by dragging the skin away on its teeth and allowing the nut to drop. The skin is then removed from the blade's teeth before those teeth completes a single rotation and encounter another nut.<br>

However, it will apparent to a person of ordinary skill in the art that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary and that the present invention may be embodied in various forms. The following description and drawings are not to be construed as limiting. Numerous specific details are described to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention, as the basis for the claims and as a basis for teaching one skilled in the art how to make and/or use the invention. However, in certain instances, well-known or conventional details may not be described in order to maintain clarity.<br>
The present invention is directed to an automatic machine for peeling the skin of areca nut comprising of an aluminium wheel, blade(s), skin/husk separator, nylon brush, conveyer chain, tub and nurling shaft. Further, the machine according to the present invention comprises an outer casing provided with a mounting mounted with a single or plurality of blades covering fully/partially the same and said mounting is provided on a shaft connected to an electric motor, as illustrated in figures 1 &amp; 2. The outer casing is having an inlet for feeding of areca nut to the machine using for example a conveyer belt/chain/wheel and two outlets. One outlet for discharging areca nut removing its skin and the other for discharging the husk and peeled skin of the areca nut.<br>
According to the present invention the raw or unprocessed areca nuts are fed through the hopper/iniet of the machine. The raw or unprocessed areca nuts are then moved/transported to the tub by means of a conveyer chain. The blade then peels the areca nuts. The peeled nuts and the skin or husk separately discharged through the respective outlets as shown in figures 1 and 2. The machine according to the present invention self adjusts to the size, shape and orientation of the areca nut size and can peel areca nuts in the size range of 10 mm to 60mm in diameter.<br>
In the present invention the peeling is achieved with the help of a blade, tub and a nurling shaft. The nuts from the conveyer chain fall in the tub and get trapped between the blade/wheel, nurling shaft and the inner walls of the tub. The teeth of the blade hold and peel the skin/husk of the areca nut while the nurling shaft rotates the nut. The tub moves forward laterally to release or allow the peeled or dehusked nut to fall into the outlet or discharge chamber from the nut peeled or dehusked nut comes out of the machine. The peeled skin or husk will be removed from the blade by husk separator and discharged through the outlet. Further, the nylon brush removes the fibres remaining in the brush.<br>
The motion of the blade and the nurling shaft is synchronised in such a way that when the blade is rotated/pushed forward in the anti-clockwise direction, the nurling shaft is rotated/pushed forward in the clockwise direction. The ratio of the rotating speeds of the blade/wheel and the nurling shaft is in the range of 1:10 to 2:11. Preferably the rotating speed ratio of the blade/wheel and the nurling shaft is 1:10.8.<br>
The diameter of the nurling shaft is in the range of 13 to 20 mm. Preferably, the diameter of the nurling shaft is 16mm. The wheel is made of hard material such as aluminium or steel or any other suitable metal or material. In one example the wheel is made of aluminium. The wheel is provided with single or plurality of the blades. In one example the wheel is provided with one blade. Alternatively the wheel can be provided with more than one blade. The diameter of the wheel is in the range of 25 to 600 mm. Preferably, the diameter of the wheel is 342 mm. Also, the wheel is provided with a plurality of steps or pit like openings as shown in figure 2.<br>
Figure 4 illustrates the blade design. The blade/mounting is made up of hard material such as stainless steel, Aluminium, Raw iron/spring steel or any other suitable material. The blade can be provided on a mounting such as wheel/straight line structure with various shapes according to the requirement. In one example the blade constitutes 25% of the wheel. In another example the blade constitutes 50 % of the wheel. In yet another example the blade constitutes 100% of the wheel. The blade is mounted on the wheel. Further, the blade is provided with a plurality of teeth/grooves. The number of grooves/teeth in the blade is in the range of 22 to 30. Preferably, the number of grooves/teeth in the blade is in the range of 25 to 27. More preferably, the blade has 26 teeth/grooves. The angle of the teeth/grooves in the blade is in the range of 1 to 90 degree centigrade. Preferably, the angle of the teeth/groove in the blade is 36 degrees centigrade.<br>
The nut should fall in the horizontal position in the tub, to be peeled. The nut will not be peeled if it falls in vertical position. When the nut falls in vertical position in the tub the steps or pit like openings on the wheel will rotate the nut to horizontal position. As illustrated in figure 2, the tub movement is controlled or enabled by a cam system comprising: an oscillating cam and a connecting rod with means of connection to the tub, wherein the oscillations of said oscillating cam are proportional to the rotational speed of an adjoining cam or bearing. The oscillations of said oscillating cam are controlled by means comprising of: a rotating cam; an off balance bearing with means of connection to the rotating cam; and means of contact/connection to the oscillating cam.<br>
The conveyer belt can be a straight conveyer having gaps to hold the nuts or a chain type conveyer having cups to hold the nuts or a conveyer belt or any suitable conveying belt or chain for carrying the areca nut.<br>
The machine according to the present invention has an outer casing made of metal like aluminium or steel or any suitable material.<br>
