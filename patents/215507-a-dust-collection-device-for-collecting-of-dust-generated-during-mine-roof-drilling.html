				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to a dust collection device for collecting dust generated during mine roof drilling.<br>
This invention relates to a dust collector device which is capable of collecting for disposal dust that gets generated during electric rotary drilling in mine roof in underground mines.<br>
In underground mines stability of roof is enhanced by roof bolting. As a first step in bolting, holes are drilled into the roof, say about one meter deep or more, before bolts are introduced into them and cemented. Hundreds of such holes are drilled into roof in each mine for bolting as a guarantee against collapse of weak roof and for protection of workers from dangers of roof fall.<br>
Drilling is a prerequisite for such roof bolting. The problem in such drilling, however, is that it exposes workers to the dangers of dust nuisance that is dust directly falling on their eyes, nose, mouth and body; and to pneumoconiosis, an irreversible dust induced occupational lung disorder.<br>
Normally drilling is carried out manually, by a team of 3-4 persons. Holes are formed vertically or in near vertical or angles in mine roof. During drilling the drillers have to lift the machine, look up and force the drill rod into mine roof. The rotating drill rod lets the drill hole dust fall directly on drillers.<br>
Thus, right from start of drilling a copious spurt of finely fragmented dust emanates from drill hole before getting dispersed. Each drill hole produced about 2.5 Kg of dust of various sizes, for every meter of hole drilled. This dust contains a good deal of freshly generated respirable fraction, capable of causing pneumoconiosis to drillers and to other miners. Nuisance dust directly falling on face and body causes eye irritation, nasal blockage and other problems. As a result of this, drillers are often reluctant to carry out roof drilling. Besides it adversely affects productivity i.e. less number of holes in a given time. Therefore, there exists a need to collect dust from such roof drilling not only for roof bolting to improve productivity, but to protect workers from occupational hazards as well.<br>
Presently, roof drilling is carried out without any dust control device. In some non-coal mines a compressed air operated heavy and cumbursome device is used for dust control during drilling in roof. Compressor and its supply lines make these devices unweildy, creating problems for shifting it from place to place, and thus such drilling becomes time consuming and costly.<br>
The present invention described herein is a device for collection of dust generated due to electric rotary drilling in mine roof, without the use of compressed air, or electricity or any other form of energy. The device is light in weight, easy to use even by unskilled workers, and can be operated by the same gang of drillers who normally drills i.e. without extra labour.<br>
The cost of drilling is not affected nor the rate of drilling. Rather it improves on both.<br>
The objective of the present invention is to provide a portable and efficient dust collector for collecting dust from electric rotary drilling in mine roof without adding to the drilling cost or efficiency and to prevent the nuisance value and health impact on workers due to dust.<br>
In the drawing accompanying this specification Figure 1 shows an assembled dust collection device in operational position with a filter bag hanging from the main frame of the device. Figure 2 represents the front view of the device with the main frame facing down. Figure 3 represents the side view of the device with the main frame facing down. and Figure 4 shows the design features of the filter bag used in the device,<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a dust collector device for collecting of dust generated during mine roof drilling which  comprises of a main frame (2) having collar (3) with a flange (4) and a cushioned base disc (1, 9), the said cushioned base disc (1,9) being connected to the said frame (2) by means (8) , a handle ( 10) being removably connected to the frame (2) by a bent rod (7), an extendable filter bag (11) being connected to the main frame (2) by a rope clamp (14), the<br>
said filter bag (11) having an opening (12) protected with a<br>
collar disc (13) having said opening (12) for drill bit<br>
to pass through.<br>
The operation of the device is described in the following para. The hole end of the filter bag is attached round the collar (3) of the main frame above flange (4) by rope claup (14)<br>
in such a way that the hole side (12) is away from the handle (10). The other end of the filter bag is allowed to loose hang through the handle frame. The handle (10) of the device is held by hand by one of the drilling crew and the device is raised to the roof till the foam cushion (9) touches the roof. The handle is gently pressed against inward by handle (10). Pressure is thus transmitted by the spring action of bent rod (7) at three equidistant positions on the main frame (2) along the same circular rod (5) - i.e. directly along the two open ends of (5) and indirectly at welded joint of (5) and (7) . This helps the cushion base (9) to hold firmly against mine roof during drilling. The drill rod is gently sent through the hole (12) in the bag till it touches, the roof where a hole is to be made. Drilling is now carried in the normal way. The filter bag collects the dust that is generated from drilling and falls through the bag to the bottom, thus avoiding its spill on drillers at work. After the drill hole is made, the device and the drill rod are shifted to the next site for drilling. No dust gets accumulated in the bag as the distal end of the bag is open, and it allows all the dust to fall on to the ground. Thus drilling in roof with the new invention permits a dust free operation, by collection of the dust from drilling, during drilling itself and by helping its disposal simultaneously.<br>
The main advantages of the present invention are :-<br>
1.       The device is simple, easy to use, light in weight and portable.<br>
2.	The device does not use any source of energy for<br>
its operation; no compressed air, electricity or any other source of energy.<br>
3.	The dust collection is by gravitational force, and<br>
by channelising the dust generated through a filter bag.<br>
4.	Dust is not allowed to fall on to the face and<br>
body of workers; it is merely allowed to slide down through the filter bag to the floor.<br>
5.	No moving parts, therefore no wear and tear.<br>
6.	Even unskilled workers can operate with it.<br>
7.	It provides comfortable atmosphere for drillers,<br>
and hence improves on productivity.<br>
8.	No extra manpower is required for drilling with<br>
the device.  Hence, does not add to the cost of<br>
drilling.<br>
9.	It can be fabricated by a SSI under a small roof.<br>
It has no imported components.<br>
10.	The drill hole in the drilling bag permits drill<br>
ing from any angle to the roof, without affecting<br>
dust collection efficiency.<br>
11.	Since the filter bag prevents dust dispersal to<br>
mine atmosphere, the risk of drillers from getting<br>
affected by pneumoconiosis is low.<br><br><br><br>
