As shown in FIG. 7, the remote controller comprises a joy stick knob 3 0 as the input operation member of the joy stick switch with a spherical or conical shape so as<br><br>
to be used as a multi-direction input operation switch knob. Moreover, similar to the case of the multi-direction input operation switch knob, in general, a cross direction input operation switch knob has a spherical or conical knob tip shape for facilitating operation in the cross directions.<br>
However, as mentioned above, according to the trend toward a smaller size, the multi-direction input operation switch knob projects drastically from the front surface of a portable terminal housing, occupying a large area. Besides, the projection may result in wrong operation during carriage.<br>
On the other hand, according to the trend toward a smaller size of the spherical or conical cross direction input operation switch knob, since the portion to be caught by a finger is small, it is conceivable that the operativity is deteriorated or change of wrong operation is larger at the time of the key input operation by a user.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE TNVEWTTON<br>
In light of the circumstances, an object of the invention is to provide a portable terminal comprising a multi-direction input operation switch knob capable of operation easily and certainly without the need of enlarging the space of the key input operation portion even though the portable terminal is made smaller, and furthermore, capable of preventing wrong operation.<br>
In order to achieve the object, the present invention<br><br>
is a portable terminal comprising a housing having a concave curved portion on a front surface thereof, and a multi-direction input operation member projecting from the bottom of the concave curved portion. A height of multi-direction input operation is less than a depth of concave curved portion, so a top of the multi-direction input operation member is provided without contacting with a flat surface of a rigid body when the housing is downwardly placed on the flat surface. According to the configuration, easy and certain operation can be achieved without the need of enlarging the space for the operation member even though the portable terminal is made smaller, and furthermore, wrong operation can be prevented even when the portable terminal is placed downward on, for example, a desk. Since a first aspect of the invention is a portable terminal comprising a housing having a concave curved portion on a front surface thereof, and a multi-direction input operation member projecting from the bottom of the concave curved portion, wherein a height of multi-direction input operation is less than a depth of concave curved portion, that is, a top of the multi-direction input operation member is placed under a plane including ends of concave curved portion, so a top of the multi-direction input operation member is provided without contacting with a flat surface of rigid body when the housing is downwardly placed on the flat surface, the effect of preventing wrong operation by providing the<br><br>
multi-direction input operation member without contacting with the flat surface of a rigid body even if the housing is placed on the flat surface with the concave curved portion downward can be achieved.<br>
Since a second aspect of the invention comprises the first aspect, wherein one of a concave portion and a convex portion is provided at an upper end of a pulling surface of the multi-direction input operation member, the effect of preventing wrong operation by providing the multi-direction input operation member without contacting with a flat surface of a rigid body even if the housing is downwardly placed on the flat surface as well as the effect of facilitating the operation of the multi-direction input operation member to the pulling side can be achieved.<br>
Since a third aspect of the invention comprises the first or second aspect, wherein a curved surface is formed on both side rims of the upper surface of the multi-direction input operation member, with the width of the upper surface set at a predetermined value, the effect of preventing wrong operation by providing the multi-direction input operation member without contacting with a flat surface of a rigid body even if the housing is placed the a flat surface with the concave curved portion downward as well as the effect of facilitating the operation of the multi-direction input operation member to the sliding direction can be achieved.<br><br>
