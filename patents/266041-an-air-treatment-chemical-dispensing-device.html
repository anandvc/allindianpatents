[0001}         Not applicable.<br>
STATEMENT REGARDING FEDERALLY SPONSORED<br>
RESEARCH/DEVELOPMENT<br>
[0002]	Not applicable<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0003]         The present invention relates to devices that dispense a volatile air<br>
treatment chemical by heating a substrate that is impregnated with, or coated with, the<br>
chemical. More particularly it relates to such devices that efficiently use heat and are<br>
easily assembled.<br>
[0004]         Substrates (particularly porous substrates) have previously been used<br>
as carriers for air treatment chemicals such as insect control agents (insecticides,<br>
insect repellents, insect growth regulators, attractants, synergists, etc.), fragrances and<br>
deodorizers. See e.g. U.S. patent 6,551,560. The disclosure of this patent, and of all<br>
other patents referred to herein are incorporated by reference as if fully set forth<br>
herein.<br>
[0005]	Upon heating of the substrate a volatile air treatment chemical is<br>
caused to be dispensed from the substrate. The heating source is typically an<br>
electrical heater, but may instead be a flame in some cases.<br>
[0006]	A variety of air treating functions can be achieved with such devices.<br>
For example, a porous substrate impregnated with volatile insecticide can be used to<br>
inhibit mosquito biting in a confined bedroom. Alternatively, a deodorizing or other<br>
odor control material can be dispensed to overcome malodors, or to simply provide a<br>
desired fragrance.<br>
[0007]	One problem with such devices is that the substrate usually rests<br>
against a heater. The heater heats the substrate, causing the volatized air treatment<br>
chemical to be driven off the substrate in a direction away from (essentially<br>
perpendicular to) a heater surface. This can create inefficiencies. For example, the<br>
portion of the substrate adjacent the heater can act as an insulator for the portion of<br><br>
the substrate which is releasing the active, making control of the dispensing more<br>
difficult.<br>
[0008]         Another problem with such devices is that it may take too long after<br>
usage begins to adequately treat the air in a defined environment adjacent the device.<br>
For example, when someone is about to go to bed they may activate the device in a<br>
bedroom. It is undesirable for them to have to wait a long period before feeling<br>
secure about insect protection in the room. If the heater must heat the entire vertical<br>
expanse of the substrate prior to dispensing being most efficient from a surface<br>
directed away from the heater, that can delay the start-up coverage.<br>
[0009]	In other developments U.S. patent application publication<br>
2002/0066798 disclosed the use of a type of snap fit connection in assembling a scent<br>
dispenser. However, that assembly was unduly complex.<br>
[0010]	Thus, to date prior art heating dispensers for dispensing air treatment<br>
chemicals were not optimal with regard to how heat was applied to the substrate or<br>
how the construction was assembled. Devices which addressed these concerns<br>
therefore continue to be desired.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0011]	In one aspect the invention provides an air treatment chemical<br>
dispensing device that can, upon mounting a substrate bearing a volatile air treatment<br>
chemical thereto, dispense the air treatment chemical from the substrate. The device<br>
has a housing and a heater positioned in the housing. The heater is in the form of a<br>
table having a facing wall, and is capable of radiating heat from at least the facing<br>
wall. There are means for mounting the substrate adjacent the facing wall so that<br>
when heat is radiated from the facing wall it will radiate at least in part towards the<br>
substrate to cause the substrate to release the air treatment chemical at least partially<br>
towards the facing wall.<br>
[0012]	The mounting means is preferably a mechanical one (e.g. resilient<br>
fingers). However, it could be any other suitable means for mounting such as<br>
adhesives, fasteners and other mechanical retainers.<br>
[0013]	In any event, there is also an air pathway structure in and through the<br>
housing permitting air to pass into the housing between the facing wall and the<br><br>
substrate (if such a substrate is mounted in the housing by the mounting means), and<br>
then out of the housing.<br>
[0014]         In a particularly preferred form the heater also has a side wall structure<br>
capable of radiating heat there from into a portion of an air pathway structure. This is<br>
used with an air pathway structure that has an inlet vent and an outlet vent, these vents<br>
being preferably located on opposed lateral sides of the device. In this manner air can<br>
be drawn in one vent, pass partially across the lateral sides of the heater, pass partially<br>
across the facing wall of the heater, and then out the outlet. The air near the substrate<br>
will mix with the released air treatment chemical. The treated air will then be<br>
released out the outlet.<br>
[0015]         This transverse air pathway is particularly desirable because the flow is<br>
at least in part between the heater and the substrate. Also, because the inlet vent can<br>
be at the bottom of the device (as the device is positioned when plugged into a vertical<br>
outlet), the heated air will naturally rise towards the outlet, further improving flow<br>
efficiency.<br>
[0016]         When the substrate is mounted as in this manner, it is most preferred<br>
that it have a projecting nose positioned in contact (or near contact) with the facing<br>
wall. The remainder of the substrate will not be in contact with the heater. Thus, heat<br>
can be directly transferred to the nose, while additional heated air passes around the<br>
nose between the substrate and the heater.<br>
[0017]         The volatile air treatment chemical can be selected from the group<br>
consisting of insect control agents, fragrances, and deodorizers. For example the<br>
volatile air treatment chemical can be an insect control agent which is selected from<br>
the group consisting of natural pyrethrins, pyrethrum extract, synthetic pyrethroids,<br>
other volatile insect control agents, and mixtures thereof.<br>
[0018]         In another form the invention provides an air treatment chemical<br>
dispensing device that can, upon mounting a substrate bearing a volatile air treatment<br>
chemical thereto, dispense the air treatment chemical from the substrate. The device<br>
has a housing, an electrical plug structure mounted in the housing with a portion<br>
extending rearwardly outward there from, a heater linked to the electrical plug<br>
structure in the housing, and a cover unit for covering the heater which is mountable<br><br>
to the housing. The cover unit is configured to be suitable to mount the substrate such<br>
that the substrate has a first wall of the substrate facing the heater while a second wall<br>
of the substrate, on a side of the substrate opposite to the first wall, is essentially<br>
covered by the cover unit.<br>
[0019]	Such a structure permits easy assembly which can be automated at low<br>
cost. For example, the housing, electrical plug structure, heater and cover unit can be<br>
assembled by relative axial movement there between, preferably with a snap fitting<br>
telescoping connection as part of the assembly.<br>
[0020]         In yet another form, the invention provides methods of assembling<br>
such devices. One can place the electrical plug structure in the housing with a portion<br>
extending rearwardly outward there from. One then places the heater in the housing<br>
and moves it axially until it telescopes with the electrical plug structure. One then<br>
mounts the cover unit to the housing while the cover unit has the substrate positioned<br>
thereon.<br>
[0021]         The substrate is preferably coated with or impregnated with a volatile<br>
air treatment chemical. In a most preferred version the substrate is configured such<br>
that it tends to wick air treatment chemical towards the heater. This could occur<br>
because the substrate comprises granular sand particles bound to a phenolic resin,<br>
where the particle size is smaller at the portion of the substrate adjacent the heater.<br>
[ 0022 ]         It should be appreciated that the devices of the present invention are<br>
inexpensive to produce, and use heat extremely efficiently. The foregoing and other<br>
advantages of the present invention will be apparent from the following description.<br>
In the description that follows reference is made to the accompanying drawings which<br>
form a part thereof, and in which there is shown by way of illustration, and not<br>
limitation, expected preferred embodiments of the invention. Such embodiments do<br>
not necessarily represent the full scope of the invention, and reference should<br>
therefore be made to the claims herein for interpreting the scope of the invention.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0028]	Referring first to FIG. 1, an air treatment device 10 has an outer<br>
housing 12 comprising a rear portion 12A and a frontal portion 12B. An electrical<br>
prong structure 14 is positioned in the housing 12, in the rear portion 12A, and has a<br>
rearward end extending rearwardly outwardly there from.<br>
[0029]	There is also a cover unit 18 mounted to the frontal housing portion<br>
12B. The cover unit 18 mounts a substrate 22 (see especially FIG. 2) such that the<br>
substrate is essentially outwardly frontally covered, but is open towards the interior of<br>
the housing.<br>
[0030]	In a particularly preferred version there is a separately installable<br>
indicator unit 26 removably mountable to the cover unit 18 so as to project outwardly<br>
and forwardly. The indicator unit 26 is preferably removable from the cover unit 18,<br>
and houses a separate indicator chemical in a cup-shaped structure 44, which may<br>
indicate to a user the amount of air treatment chemical remaining in the substrate 22.<br>
The indicator unit 26 may have a removable lid 42 with an easy-grab tab 47. The rear<br>
of the indicator unit 26 may extend into a well 38 formed in the cover unit to facilitate<br>
some heat transfer through wall 48 to the indicator unit.<br>
[0031]	The device 10 is most preferably plugged into an electric socket on a<br>
vertical wall 16. The directional terms in this patent are used with that type of<br>
installation in mind. However, appropriate electric sockets on horizontal or other<br>
surfaces may also be used to provide power. Thus, the terms such as "front", "rear",<br>
"upper", "lower", and "side" should be interpreted in an analogous manner when the<br>
devices are used for that type of installation.<br><br>
[00321         The electrical prong structure 14 shown in the figures are merely for<br>
purposes of example. Cylindrical prongs of this type are suitable for linking to<br>
electric power in some countries. However, in other countries blade prongs, or<br>
mixtures of blades, cylinders and other shaped prong elements will be used to supply<br>
the linkage to the available power (as is well recognized in the art).<br>
[0033]	The frontal housing 12 has a series of elongated vents 30 on its upper<br>
and lower sides. The vents 30A form an inlet part of an air pathway, by allowing air<br>
from the environment to enter. Air then passes as shown by the arrows in FIG. 2.<br>
[0034]	Note that the heater 56 is in the form of a table having a frontal facing<br>
wall 61 and a side wall structure 63. Heat can radiate towards the substrate 22, and<br>
also sideways around the table. Thus, air entering the vents 30A will heat up very<br>
quickly and efficiently.<br>
[0035]	Note also that the nose projection 25 on the substrate 22 can be in<br>
direct contact with the facing wall 61. This permits direct heat transfer. Nevertheless,<br>
additional heat can be applied along the sides of the nose as the somewhat heated air<br>
passes between the wall 65 of the substrate that faces the table and the facing wall 61 -<br>
[0036]	This is particularly effective in causing a very fast burst of insecticide<br>
or other air treatment chemical when the device is first turned on. Hence, a room can<br>
be rendered adequately treated quite quickly. Also, where the substrate 22 is of the<br>
type that wicks the air treatment chemical towards the wall 65, the burst can be<br>
repeated after the device has been shut off for a day and then turned on again.<br>
[0037]	After the air treatment chemical has been released into the air adjacent<br>
facing wall 61, it will pass generally transversely along the facing wall 61 until it exits<br>
outlet vent 30B. This then treats the surrounding environmental air with the air<br>
treatment chemical.<br>
[0038]	While the preferred substrate shape is a substrate having a forward<br>
frustum shaped section 23 and a rearward projecting nose 25, other shapes can be<br>
used, with or without a projecting portion. The substrate 22 is preferably completely<br>
impregnated with a volatile air treatment chemical capable of being dispensed from<br>
the substrate 22 when the substrate 22 is heated. However, as an alternative to being<br><br>
completely impregnated with the air treatment chemical, the substrate 22 may instead<br>
be only partially impregnated or just coated with the chemical.<br>
[0039]         The housing 12 of the overall device 10 encloses the table-shaped<br>
heater with a sufficient insulation gap to the outer housing wall to prevent the side<br>
wall from heating too much. The heater is preferably activated by inserting the<br>
rearward end of the electrical prong structure 14 into an outlet. Heat from the heater<br>
56 may also be permitted to pass against other surfaces of the cover unit 18 through a<br>
series of openings 32 and 36 (see FIG. 4D). Note that wall 48 effectively closes off air<br>
dispensing through the front of the device.<br>
£0040]         Referring next to FIG. 3, from top to bottom (forward to rear in the<br>
installed device), the device 10 has a removable cover unit 18 (shown here without<br>
the indicator unit 26) which, lockingly engages with the heater 56, in a subassembly,<br>
after positioning the substrate in the cover unit. This can be achieved with a snap fit<br>
connection, or by a bayonet connection, or by other means.<br>
[0041]         A heater enclosure wall 56A is linked to an aluminum contact 60, a<br>
thermal cutoff (TCO) 62, a thermistor 64, a neon in use light 70, and a resistor 72, all<br>
of which telescopingly, matingly engage with the underside of the heating enclosure<br>
wall 56A. The TCO 62 and light 70 each have an end which matingly engage with<br>
corresponding silicon sleeves 74, which in turn snap into corresponding holes in the<br>
housing 12. A star contact 66 is preferably inserted between the aluminum contact 60<br>
and one of two plug decks 68 forming a pin bridge 69. In turn, the pin bridge 69<br>
preferably snaps into the housing 12, thereby completing the device 10.<br>
(00423         It should be appreciated that the main components of the assembly can<br>
be assembled without tools, and in most cases with simple axial relative movement.<br>
This makes the production of the device extremely inexpensive.<br>
[0043]         Once the device is plugged in, the electric current moves through the<br>
electrical prong structure 14 to drive the heater and the on light 70. Overheating is<br>
prevented by the TCO.<br>
[0044]         The heater enclosure wall 56A may be made of any material suitable<br>
for the environment (e.g. heat resistant metals, plastics and the like). While the heater<br><br>
can be of many forms, a resistance heater is preferred. However, in some forms a<br>
flame, catalytic burner, or other combustion source may heat the table.<br>
[0045]	Further, while a variety of resistance elements may be used, we prefer<br>
a low resistance thermistor 64, which has a positive temperature coefficient in which<br>
the zero-power resistance increases with an increase in temperature.<br>
[0046]	Referring next to FIGS. 4A-4E, the telescopic, snap-fit assembly<br>
method of the device 10 is depicted. In the most preferred form each piece of the<br>
device 10 preferably telescopically fits together, and in some cases the parts snap fit<br>
together to lock the assembly together. In use, the on light 70 telescopingly engages<br>
an opening 57 within the heater enclosure wall 56A configured to accommodate the<br>
on light 70. When the light 70 is properly positioned in the opening 57, the light 70<br>
snaps into position, thus securing the light 70 to the heater enclosure wall 56A. When<br>
the light 70 is snapped in place, the star contact 66 is telescopingly inserted into a<br>
plug deck 68 of the pin bridge 69 and snapped in place. At the same time* the pin<br>
bridge 69 is inserted into the housing 12 and snapped in place.<br>
[0047]	The electrical prong structure 14 includes a bridge 69. The electrical<br>
prong structure is pulled through the.rearward end of the housing 12 until the prongs<br>
snap in place (see FIG. 4B). This pulls the heater enclosure wall 56A over the contact<br>
60, TCO 62, thermistor 64 and resistor 72. The heater enclosure wall 56A is<br>
preferably pushed down towards the housing 12, past retaining beads (not shown)<br>
until the heater enclosure wall 56A snaps into place in the housing 12 (see FIG. 4C).<br>
[0048]	Once the heater enclosure wall 56A is secured in the housing 12, the<br>
cover unit 18 (with the substrate 22 included) is preferably inserted into<br>
corresponding openings on the housing (not shown) by pressing firmly downward<br>
until the cover unit 18 snaps into place. Finally, an optional indicator unit 26 or other<br>
decorative plate (not shown) may be screwed into place on the front of the cover unit<br>
18 by engaging the legs 40 of the indicator unit with corresponding openings 43<br>
defined by the cover unit 18.<br>
[0049]	Similarly, legs (not shown) of the cover unit 18 permit a quick, snap-fit<br>
attachment to the housing 12 via corresponding grooves 50 in the housing 12. See<br>
e.g. FIG. 4E.<br><br>
[0050]         Examples of a suitable substrate 22 include but are not limited to<br>
porous sand with a binder such as novolac resin, urethane resins or highly cross linked<br>
thermoplastics such as cross linked polyethylene. Particularly preferred sand<br>
substrates can be made in a fashion analogous to the sand wicks described in U.S.<br>
patent application publication 2005/0284952. Alternative substrates include other<br>
particulates such as metal, cellulose, and ceramic particulates.<br>
[0051]	The air treatment chemical is preferably an insecticide, fragrance<br>
and/or disinfectant. In some cases more than one air treatment chemical may be used<br>
alone or in combination in the substrate 22.<br>
[0052 ]	When the air treatment chemical is an insecticide and/or insect<br>
repellent, organic phosphorous insecticides, lipidamide insecticides, natural repellents<br>
as citronella oil, natural pyrethrins and pyrethrum extract, and synthetic pyrethroids<br>
are preferred. Suitable synthetic pyrethroids are acrinathrin, allethrin as D-allethrin,<br>
PynaminR™, benfluthrin, bifenthrin, bioallethrin as Pynamin ForteR™, S-<br>
bioallethrin, esbiothrin, esbiol, bisoresmethrin, cycloprothrin, cyfluthrin, beta-<br>
cyfluthrin, cyhalothrin, lambda-cyhalothrin, cypermethrin, alpha-cypermethrin, beta-<br>
cypermethrin, cyphenothrin, deltamethrin, empenthrin, esfenvalerate, fenpropathrin,<br>
fenvalerate, flucythrinate, taufluvalinate, kadethrin, permethrin, phenothrin,<br>
prallethrin as EtocR™, resmethrin, tefluthrin, tetramethrin, tralomethrin, metofluthrin,<br>
or transfluthrin. Other volatile insecticides, such as those described in U.S. patent<br>
4,439,415, can also be employed.<br>
[0053]	In particularly preferred versions the volatile insecticide is selected<br>
from the group consisting of transfluthrin, metofluthrin, vapothrin, permethrin,<br>
prallethrin, tefluthrin and esbiothrin. Transfluthrin is the most preferred insecticide.<br>
[0054]	Possible solvents for carrying these air treatment chemicals include,<br>
but are not limited to, ISOPAR™C, ISOPAR™E, ISOPAR™L, heptane, methanol,<br>
acetone, ethanol, isopropyl alcohol, dodecene and tetraydrofuran. ISOPAR™C,<br>
ISOPAR™E and ISOPAR™L are hydrocarbon solvents of varying chain length and<br>
are available from Exxon Chemical Company.<br>
[ 0055]	Typically, volatile insect control agents -will be carried in an organic<br>
solvent such as a hydrocarbon. One particularly desirable impregnation formulation<br><br>
for mosquito control is 50 wt. percent transfluthrin dissolved in ISOPAR C,<br>
hydrocarbon. Alternatively and often preferably, transfluthrin can first be warmed to<br>
liquefy it and then applied neat to a warmed substrate.<br>
[0056]         A wide variety of volatile fragrances may be used which may<br>
optionally also have insect control attributes. Alternatively, some fragrances may be<br>
selected that provide a deodorizing function (e.g. certain terpenes). For example,<br>
various natural and artificial perfumes may be used. Non-limiting examples of these<br>
perfumes include animal-based and plant-based natural perfumes, and artificial<br>
perfumes such as alcohols, phenols, aldehydes, ketones, terpenes, and esters<br>
[0057]         When an volatile air treatment chemical is a disinfectant, preferred<br>
disinfectants include, but are not limited to, glycols, trimethylene and dipropyiene.<br>
Organic acids compatible with the use of the substrate 22 and environment may also<br>
be used.<br>
[0058]	While the preferred embodiment of the present invention has been<br>
described above, it should be appreciated that the invention could be used in a variety<br>
of other embodiments. For example, the vent holes need not be placed on the<br>
transverse sides of the housing. Thus, the principles of the present invention can be<br>
applied in a wide variety of other ways apart from those specifically noted herein.<br>
Still other modifications may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of<br>
the invention. Thus, the claims (rather than just the preferred embodiment) should be<br>
reviewed in order to understand the full scope of the invention.<br>
Industrial Applicability<br>

1.	An air treatment chemical dispensing device that can, upon mounting a<br>
substrate bearing a volatile air treatment chemical thereto, dispense the air treatment<br>
chemical from the substrate, the device comprising:<br>
a housing;<br>
a heater positioned in the housing, wherein the heater is in a form of a table<br>
having a facing wall, wherein the heater is capable of radiating heat from at least the<br>
facing wall;<br>
means for mounting the substrate adjacent the facing wall so that when heat is<br>
radiated from the facing wall it will radiate at least in part towards the substrate to<br>
cause the substrate to release the air treatment chemical at least partially towards the<br>
facing wall; and<br>
an air pathway structure in and through the housing permitting air to pass into<br>
the housing between the facing wall and the substrate, if such a substrate is mounted<br>
in the housing by the means for mounting, and then out of the housing.<br>
2.	The device of claim 1, wherein the heater table also has a side wall<br>
structure capable of radiating heat there from into a portion of the air pathway<br>
structure.<br>
3.	The device of claim 1, wherein the air pathway structure comprises an inlet<br>
vent and an outlet vent located on opposed lateral sides of the device such that the air<br>
pathway structure extends transversely across the facing wall.<br>
4.	The device of claim 1, further comprising the substrate mounted by the<br>
means for mounting in the housing.<br>
5.	The device of claim 4, wherein the substrate has a projecting nose<br>
positioned adjacent the facing wall.<br>
6.	The device of claim 5, wherein the substrate has a projecting nose<br>
positioned in contact with the facing wall.<br>
7.	The device of claim 4, wherein when the heater is activated the substrate is<br>
heated thereby to release the air treatment chemical into air passing through the air<br>
pathway structure.<br><br>
8.	The device of claim 1, wherein the volatile air treatment chemical is<br>
selected from the group consisting of insect control agents, fragrances, and<br>
deodorizers.<br>
9.	The device of claim 8, wherein the volatile air treatment chemical is an<br>
insect control agent.<br>
10.	The device of claim 9, wherein the volatile air treatment chemical is<br>
selected from the group consisting of transfluthrin and metofluthrin.<br>
11.	An air treatment chemical dispensing device that can, upon mounting a<br>
substrate bearing a volatile air treatment chemical thereto, dispense the air treatment<br>
chemical from the substrate, the device comprising:<br>
a housing;<br>
an electrical plug structure mounted in the housing with a portion extending<br>
rearwardly outward there from;<br>
a heater linked to the electrical plug structure in the housing; and<br>
a cover unit covering the heater and mounted to the housing;<br>
wherein the cover unit mounts the substrate such that the substrate has a first<br>
wall of the substrate facing the heater while a second wall of the substrate, on a side<br>
of the substrate opposite to the first wall, is essentially covered by the cover unit.<br>
12.	The device of claim 11, wherein the housing, electrical plug structure,<br>
heater and cover unit can be assembled by relative axial movement there between.<br>
13.	The device of claim 12, wherein a snap fit connection facilitates assembly<br>
of at least two of the housing, electrical plug structure, heater and cover unit.<br>
14.	The device of claim 11, wherein the heater is in a form of a table having a<br>
facing wall and a side wall structure, wherein the heater is capable of radiating heat<br>
from the facing wall and the side wall structure when the device is assembled and<br>
powered by electricity.<br>
15.	The device of claim 11, wherein a portion of the heater can be telescoped<br>
into the electrical plug structure.<br><br>
16. A method for assembling the device of claim 11, comprising:<br>
placing the electrical plug structure in the housing by relative axial movement,<br>
with a portion extending rearwardly outward there from;<br>
placing the heater in the housing by relative axial movement until it telescopes<br>
with the electrical plug structure; and<br>
mounting the cover unit to the housing by relative axial movement while the<br>
cover unit has the substrate positioned thereon.<br><br>
Disclosed is a device suitable for dispensing air treatment chemicals by heating a<br>
substrate impregnated with the chemicals. The device has a heater in the form of a<br>
table where a face of the table radiates heat directly to the impregnated substrate. The<br>
substrate releases the air treatment chemical back towards the heater. A transverse air<br>
pathway permits venting of the volatile chemical. Also disclosed are methods for<br>
assembling such devices.<br></td>
