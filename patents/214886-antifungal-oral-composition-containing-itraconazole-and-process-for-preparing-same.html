				<td>ANTIFUNGAL ORAL COMPOSITION CONTAINING ITRACONAZOLE AND PROCESS FOR PREPARING SAME<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to an oral composition of itraconazole having improved itraconazole bioavailability, and a process for the preparation thereof.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Itraconazole, a triazole compound, is known to have excellent antifungal activity. However, the bioavailability of orally administered itraconazole is very low because it has a very low solubility of less than 1 µg/ml in water and it remains unionized in the gastric juice due to its pKa value of 3.7. Further, it is known that the degree of bioavailability of orally administered itraconazole varies widely among individuals and depends on other factors such ingested foods.<br>
PCT International Publication No. WO 85/02767 and U.S. Patent No. 4,764,604 teach a method for increasing the solubility of itraconazole by employing a cyclodextrin inclusion compound of itraconazole. However, this method has the problems that the incremental increase in the itraconazole solubility is only marginal and various complicated preparative procedures are required.<br>
Recently, PCT International Publication No. WO 94/05263 discloses a coated bead preparation, wherein a core made of pharmaceutically inert or neutral sucrose, dextrine, starch and the like is coated with a mixture of itraconazole and a hydrophilic polymer and, then, the resulting bead is coated again with a polymer, e.g., polyethylene glycol. Such a coated bead preparation is commercially available from Janssen Pharmaceutica(Beerse, Belgium) under the trade name of Sporanox capsule. However, the manufacturing process of the above preparation is very complicated due to the fact the beads having an average size of only 600 to 700 µm tend to undergo agglomeration during the manufacturing process.<br>
PCT International Publication No. WO 97/44014 teaches a solid dispersion of itraconazole in a water-soluble polymer, which is prepared by<br>
Subjecting a mixture of itraconazole and the water soluble polymer to a melt-extursion process at a temperature ranging from 245 ° C to 265  C. this solid dispersion is described to have an improved bioavailability of itraconazole which is not influenced by ingested foods, and it is commercially available from Janssen Pharmaceutica (Beerse, Belgium) under the trade name of Sporanox ® tablet. However, the manufacturing process of the solid dispersion • is hampered by a number of difficulties in controlling varios process variables, and the in vivo bioavailability of itraconazole achievable with the above dispersion is still low. Accordingly, there has existed a need to develop an oral composition having improved in vivo bioavailability of itraconazole.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to provide an improved oral composition<br>
comprising itraconazole.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a process for preparing said oral<br>
composition.<br>
In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, there is provided an antifungal composition for oral administration comprising a fused mixture of itraconazole and phosphoric acid, a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and a surfactant. In accordance with the present invention relates to an antifungal composition for oral administration comprising a fused mixture of itraconazole and phosphoric acid, a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier such as herein described and a surfactant such as herein described, wherein the fused mixture is prepared by mixing itraconazole and phosphoric acid in a weight ratio ranging from 1 : 0.1, to 1 : 10 and heating the mixture.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
The above and other objects and features of the present invention will become apparent from the following description of the invention, when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which:<br>
Fig. 1 shows the bioavailabilities of the inventive itraconazole preparation and a commercially available itraconazole preparation.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Through this specification, a solid obtained by the steps of fusing itraconazole with phosphoric acid to form a melt and cooling the melt is designated a fused mixture of itraconazole and phosphoric acid. Such a<br>
mixture has a melting point which is much lower than that of itraconazole, and the dissolution of itraconazole from said mixture into an aqueous solution is greatly enhanced as compared with solid itraconazole, with a consequential increase of the in vivo bioavailability of itraconazole.<br>
The weight ratio of itraconazole and phosphoric acid in the fused<br>
mixture of the present invention is in the range of 1:0.1 to 1:10, preferably,<br>
1:0.5 to 1:5.	<br>
The inventive composition comprising a fused mixture of itraconazole and phosphoric acid may contain a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier such as lactose, dextrin, starch, microcrystalline cellulose, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose, methyl cellulose, polyethylene glycol, silicon dioxide, hydrotalcite, aluminum magnesium silicate, aluminum hydroxide, aluminum silicate, magnesium aluminum metasilicate, bentonite and a mixture thereof.<br>
The antifungal oral composition of the present invention may further comprise a surfactant which promotes the wetting of the fused mixture of itraconazole and phosphoric acid in a aqueous medium. Representative examples of the surfactant include:<br>
(1)	polyoxyethylene glycolated natural or hydrogenated vegetable oils<br>
such   as   polyoxyethylene   glycolated   natural   or   hydrogenated   castor<br>
oil(Cremophor , BASF),<br>
(2)	polyoxyethylene-sorbitan-fatty acid esters wherein fatty acid is<br>
mono- or tri-lauric, palmitic, stearic or oleic acid(Tween  , ICI),<br>
(3)	polyoxyethylene fatty acid esters such as polyoxyethylene stearic<br>
acid ester(Myrj, ICI),<br>
(4)	polyoxyethylene-polyoxypropylene block copolymer(Poloxamer ,<br>
BASF),<br>
(5)	sodium dioctyl sulfosuccinate or sodium lauryl sulfate,<br>
(6)	phospholipids,<br>
(7)	propylene glycol mono- or di-fatty acid esters such as propylene<br>
glycol dicaprylate, propylene glycol dilaurate, propylene glycol isostearate,<br>
propylene glycol  laurate, propylene glycol  ricinoleate,  propylene glycol<br>
caprylic-capric acid diester(Miglyol 840, Hu 1s),<br><br>
(8)	trans-esterification products of natural vegetable oil triglycerides<br>
and polyalkylene polyols(Labrafil  M, Gattefosse),<br>
(9)	mono-, di- or mono/di-glycerides such as caprylic/capric acid mono-<br>
and di-glycerides(Imwitor , Hu ls), and<br>
(10) sorbitan fatty acid esters such as sorbitan monolauryl, sorbitan monopalmityl and sorbitan monostearyl esters(Span , ICI).<br>
Among the above-mentioned surfactants, polyoxyethylene glycolated natural or hydrogenated vegetable oils, polyoxyethylene-sorbitan-fatty acid esters, and polyoxyethylene-polyoxypropylene block copolymer are preferably used in the present invention.<br>
Further, in accordance with another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a process for preparing the inventive composition comprising (a) mixing itraconazole and phosphoric acid, (b) heating the mixture to a temperature ranging from 100 to 17000 to obtain a homogeneous melt mixture, (c) adding a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and a surfactant thereto, (d) cooling the resulting mixture to obtain a solid, and (e) pulverizing the solid.<br>
Alternatively, the inventive composition may be prepared by employing an organic solvent, e.g., ethanol, methylene chloride and chloroform. Specifically, itraconazole is mixed with phosphoric acid and a small amount of an organic solvent is added to the resulting mixture to obtain a solution. Subsequently, a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and a surfactant are added thereto, and the resulting solution is heated to vapourize the solvent and then cooled to obtain a solid, which is then pulverized.<br>
The pharmaceutical composition of the present invention may be formulated into various pharmaceutical preparations, e.g., powder, granule, tablet, coated preparation and liquid preparation, in accordance with any of the conventional procedures. For instance, a hard capsule may be prepared by adding a lubricant and other pharmaceutical additives to the pharmaceutical composition, processing the mixture into a powder or granules and filling the powder or granules into a hard gelatin capsule; a tablet, by adding a suitable additive to the pharmaceutical composition and tableting the mixture; a liquid preparation, by dissolving the pharmaceutical composition in water; and a coated preparation, by coating a solution of the pharmaceutical composition on a sugar bead such as Non-pareil (Edward Mendell Co., UK).<br>
As described above, the inventive composition comprising a fused mixture of itraconazole and phosphoric acid gives a remarkably !"§!?, 1<br>
bioavailability of itraconazole. Further, the inventive method for the preparation of the inventive antifungal composition comprising itraconazole has an advantage over prior art methods in that it is a lower temperature<br>
process having a high productivity. „<br>

Test Example 1: Dissolution Test<br>
Dissolution rates of itraconazole were determined for the inventive preparations of Examples 1 to 3; the preparation of Comparative Example; Sporanox® capsule; and Sporanox® tablet(Janssen Korea), in accordance with the dissolution test method II(paddle method) described in the General Tests chapter of Korean Pharmacopoeia under the conditions listed below:<br>
Test apparatus: Erweka DT80(Erweka, Germany)<br>
Test solutions: 900 ml of 0.1 N Hcl<br>
Temperature of test solutions: 37 ± 0.5<br>
Rotation speed: 100 ± 4rpm<br>
Analytical method: liquid chromatography<br>
-	column: Cosmosil C 18(150 mm x 4.6 mm; Nacalai tesque,<br>
Japan)<br>
-	mobile phase: acetonitrile/phosphate buffer(Ph 7-0) = 60:40<br>
-	flow rate: 1.2 ml/mm.<br>
-	detector: UV 255 ran<br>
-	injection volume: 10 µl<br>
The amount of dissolved itraconazole is represented by the cumulative imount of itraconazole eluted in 45 min. and the results are shown in Table 1.<br>
Table 1<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
As can be seen in Table 1, the preparations of Examples 1 to 3 exhibit remarkedly higher amounts of itraconazole dissolved than those of Comparative Example and Sporanox® capsule. This result proves that the solubilization of itraconazole in water is greatly enhanced by using the inventive fused mixture of itraconazole and phosphoric acid.<br>
Further, although preparation of Sporanox®* tablet shows a high level of dissolved itraconazole similar to those of Examples 1 to 3, the manufacturing process of the inventive preparations is much simpler and has a higher productivity than that of Sporanox® tablet. Further, the in vivo bioavailability of itraconazole in Sporanox® tablet is significantly lower as compared with the inventive composition, as shown in Test Example 2.<br>
Test Example 2: In Vivo Absorption Test<br>
In order to investigate the bioavailability of itraconazole contained in the inventive preparations, in vivo absorption tests were carried out as follows. Thirty 14 or 15 week-old male Sprague-Dawly rats each weighing<br>
about 300 g were fasted for over 48 hours while they were allowed free access to water, and then divided into two groups each containing 10 rats.<br>
The two groups of rats were orally administered with the inventive preparation of Examples 1 and Sporanox® tablet, respectively, in a dose of 20 mg itraconazole/kg body weight of the rat. Blood samples were taken directly from the hearts of the rats before the administration and after 2, 4, 6, 8 and 24 hours from the administration, and sera were separated therefrom.<br>
Added to 500 µl each of the serum samples were 50 µl of an internal standard solution(methanol solution containing 500 µg/ml of nitrate econazole) and 200 µl of 1 M carbonate buffer(Ph 10.0). 7 ml of an extraction solven(n-heptaneiisoamylalchol=9:l) was added thereto and the resulting mixture was shaken at 80 rpm for 5 min. to obtain an extract. The extract was centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 10 min. and the solvent was evaporated at 50 0C under a nitrogen atmosphere. To the resulting residue was added 200 µl of 0.05% triethylamine solution of 65% aqueous acetonitrile and the mixture was subjected to HPLC under the following conditions:<br>
-	column: Inertsil ODS2(250 x 4.6 mm, 5 µm; GL science, Japan)<br>
-	mobile phase: 65% aqueous acetonitrile solution containing 0.05%<br>
triethylamine<br>
-	detector UV 258 nm<br>
-	flow rate: 1.2 ml/min.<br>
-	injection volume: 100 µl<br>
The result in Fig. 1 shows that the bioavailability of itraconazole observed for the inventive preparation is much higher as compared to Sporanox® tablet.<br>
While the invention has been described with respect to the above specific embodiments, it should be recognized that various modifications and changes may be made to the invention by those skilled in the art which also fall within the scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims.<br><br><br><br><br>
