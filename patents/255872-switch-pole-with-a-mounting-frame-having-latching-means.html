Description<br>
Switch pole with a mounting frame having latching means<br>
The invention relates to a switch pole for interruption of an<br>
electrical alternating current having a mounting frame, which<br>
is manufactured from a dielectric material, and having a<br>
switching tube which extends in a longitudinal direction within<br>
the mounting frame between an input connection and an output<br>
connection and is designed to interrupt the alternating current<br>
between the input connection and the output connection with the<br>
input connection, the output connection and the switching tube<br>
being held by the mounting frame.<br>
A switch pole such as this is already known from<br>
US 2001/0025829 Al. The switch pole disclosed there has a<br>
mounting frame which is manufactured from a dielectric material<br>
and is designed to hold a vacuum interrupter tube which extends<br>
in a longitudinal direction between an input connection and an<br>
output connection. The mounting frame is designed to hold said<br>
connecting pieces and the vacuum interrupter tube, which is at<br>
a high-voltage potential during operation, in an isolated form.<br>
The already known switch pole is subject to the disadvantage<br>
that the mounting frame has only a restricted isolation<br>
capability for the generally high electrical fields during<br>
operation, so that complex additional measures must be provided<br>
for the components to which high voltage is applied.<br>
The invention is based on the object of providing a switch pole<br>
of the type mentioned initially, which has a mounting frame<br>
whose isolation capability can be matched in a simple manner to<br>
the respective requirements placed on the switch pole.<br><br>
PCT/DE2005/001435	- 2 -<br>
2005P13827WOIN<br>
The invention achieves this object in that the mounting frame<br>
has latching means for holding additional isolating parts, by-<br>
means of which the isolation capability of the mounting frame<br>
is increased.<br>
Within the scope of the invention, the mounting frame has<br>
latching means. The latching means are used to hold additional<br>
isolating parts which, for example, extend like walls on the<br>
mounting frame. The additional isolating parts are manufactured<br>
from an insulating material, for example an insulating plastic,<br>
and carry out additional isolating functions on the mounting<br>
frame. Within the scope of the invention, it is therefore<br>
possible to increase the isolation capability of the entire<br>
mounting frame in a simple manner and at low cost simply by<br>
insertion of the additional isolating parts into the latching<br>
means of the mounting frame. The switch pole according to the<br>
invention can therefore be matched by simple measures to the<br>
respective requirements which apply of the desired installation<br>
location. For example, it is possible within the scope of the<br>
invention to increase the operating parameters such as the<br>
operating voltage, with the additional isolation that is<br>
required in this case because of the high electrical fields<br>
that occur being provided by the additional isolating parts<br>
inserted into the latching means.<br>
The mounting frame is advantageously composed of a mechanically<br>
dimensionally stable plastic, and the additional parts are<br>
composed of an elastically deformable plastic. For example, the<br>
mounting frame is composed of a thermosetting plastic, and the<br>
additional isolating parts are composed of a thermoplastic.<br>
According to this advantageous further development, only the<br>
mounting frame carries out the mechanical supporting function<br>
for the components of the switching tube which are mounted in<br>
it, while the additional isolating parts just have an isolating<br>
effect, because of their elasticity. Because of the elasticity<br>
of the additional isolating parts, they can be inserted<br><br>
PCT/DE2005/001435	- 2a -<br>
2005P13827WOIN<br>
particularly easily into the latching means of the mounting<br>
frame, with the elasticity<br><br>
PCT/DE2005/001435	- 3 -<br>
2005P13827WOIN<br>
allowing additional retention, for example by creating a force<br>
fit.<br>
The additional isolating parts which are held in the latching<br>
means advantageously form a labyrinth structure with the<br>
latching means. The labyrinth structure increases the<br>
electrical withstand capability of the connecting areas in the<br>
joints bounded by the isolating part and the mounting frame.<br>
Furthermore, if the additional isolating part is also elastic,<br>
this results in even better contact between the isolating part<br>
and the mounting frame, so that the electrical withstand<br>
capability is also improved by this characteristic. The<br>
labyrinth structure increases the creepage current distance<br>
from a component to which high-voltage potential is applied to<br>
a surface which is at ground potential.<br>
The latching means are advantageously in the form of latching<br>
grooves. In this case, the additional isolating parts have a<br>
wall thickness which corresponds approximately to the internal<br>
distance between the latching grooves, thus allowing the<br>
additional isolating parts to be inserted into the latching<br>
grooves and at the same time providing retention for the<br>
additional isolating parts in the latching grooves. In contrast<br>
to this, it is likewise possible within the scope of the<br>
invention for the additional isolating parts to be bent<br>
elastically into the latching grooves during insertion, and to<br>
provide retention for the additional isolating parts, just for<br>
this reason. The latching grooves are, for example, formed at<br>
expedient points on the mounting frame. In contrast to this,<br>
the latching grooves on individual mounting frame components<br>
run over a longer distance.<br>
The frame advantageously has two side walls, with the latching<br>
means extending in the longitudinal direction on the side<br>
walls. By way of example, the side walls are formed parallel to<br>
one another, with lateral webs or attachment<br><br>
PCT/DE2005/001435	- 4 -<br>
2005P13827WOIN<br>
webs which extend in the lateral direction between the side<br>
walls providing the necessary mechanical retention for the<br>
switch pole. The wall-like configuration of the mounting frame<br>
has the advantage that the mounting frame provides a housing-<br>
like shielding effect on two mutually opposite sides, with two<br>
sides of the mounting frame, which are likewise mutually<br>
opposite, being open and not covered. Within the scope of the<br>
invention, it is possible with the aid of the latching means to<br>
provide the sides of the mounting frame which are not shielded<br>
or covered with additional isolating parts, which are likewise<br>
in the form of walls, thus resulting overall in a closed<br>
housing around the components to which high-voltage potential<br>
is applied.<br>
The additional isolating parts expediently have a cross section<br>
with a U-profile, at least in places. A U-profile has been<br>
found to be particularly advantageous for latching the<br>
additional isolating parts to the latching means since an<br>
elastic restoring force is produced by the free limbs of the U-<br>
profile being bent towards one another, and this can be used to<br>
secure the additional isolating components. Furthermore, the<br>
end face of the free limbs can easily be inserted into the<br>
latching means.<br>
In one preferred exemplary embodiment, the free limbs of the U-<br>
profile are thus inserted, in the installed state, at the end<br>
into latching grooves in the mounting frame. The wall thickness<br>
of the free limbs expediently corresponds approximately to the<br>
internal diameter of the latching grooves, as has already been<br>
stated.<br>
The end wall thickness of the free limbs of the U-profile is<br>
advantageously only slightly larger than the diameter of the<br>
latching grooves, so that the free limbs are<br><br>
PCT/DE2005/001435	- 5 -<br>
2005P13827WOIN<br>
slightly elastically deformed during insertion, in this way<br>
producing a retaining force.<br>
In contrast to this, it is possible within the scope of the<br>
invention for the free limbs of the U-profile to rest at the<br>
end, in the installed state, on stop shoulders which are formed<br>
in the side walls, with their outer faces being pressed against<br>
the inner faces of the side walls, thus producing a force fit<br>
between the additional isolating part and the mounting frame.<br>
According to this refinement of the invention, the restoring<br>
forces are made use of which result when the free limbs of the<br>
U-profile are moved towards one another beyond their<br>
equilibrium position and in this position rest on the inner<br>
walls of the mounting frame. The restoring force then produces<br>
a force fit, which is sufficient to hold the additional<br>
isolating components. The stop shoulders are used only for<br>
accurate alignment of the additional isolating parts on the<br>
mounting frame.<br>
The additional isolating parts advantageously have tubular<br>
connecting stubs at least in places which, in the installed<br>
state, extend from the input connection and/or the output<br>
connection. The tubular connecting stubs make it possible to<br>
pass conductor connections to the input connection or to the<br>
output connection, with the tubular connecting stubs producing<br>
additional isolation in the connecting area between the<br>
conductors connected to them and the connecting pieces, without<br>
having to touch the electrical conductor in the process. This<br>
even further enhances the isolating capability of the switch<br>
pole and of the mounting frame.<br>
Further, more expedient refinements and advantages of the<br>
invention are the subject matter of the following description<br>
of exemplary embodiments of the invention with reference to the<br><br>

drawing, with components that have the same effect being<br>
provided with the same reference symbols, and in which:<br>
Figure 1 shows a perspective illustration of one exemplary<br>
embodiment of the switch pole according to the<br>
invention with a mounting frame without additional<br>
isolating parts,<br>
Figure 2 shows the switch pole shown in Figure 1 with<br>
additional isolating parts inserted,<br>
Figure 3 shows a cross-sectional view of the switch pole shown<br>
in Figure 1,<br>
Figure 4 shows a front view of the switch pole shown in Figure<br>
2, and<br>
Figure 5 shows a section view along the line V-V of the switch<br>
pole shown in Figure 4.<br>
Figure 1 shows a perspective illustration of a first exemplary<br>
embodiment of a switch pole 1 according to the invention. The<br>
switch pole 1 has a mechanically firm mounting frame 2 to which<br>
a pole head section 3b of an input connection 3 is attached. An<br>
attachment web 4, which extends in the lateral direction and<br>
has attachment holes for the pole head section 3b to be screwed<br>
to is used for this purpose. The attachment web 4 also has an<br>
aperture opening 5 through which a vacuum interrupter tube 6<br>
can be screwed tightly, as the switching tube, to the pole head<br>
section 3b of the input connection 3. The vacuum interrupter<br>
tube 6 comprises a hollow cylindrical ceramic housing 7 which<br>
is composed of two parts which are connected to one another in<br>
the center, with the interposition of an intermediate flange.<br>
On the end faces, the ceramic housing 7 is closed by metallic<br>
covers, which cannot be seen in Figure 1, thus forming a<br>
vacuum-tight housing. On the upper face of the vacuum<br><br>
PCT/DE2005/001435 - 6a -<br>
2005P13827WOIN<br>
interrupter tube 6, in Figure 1, a fixed contact bolt projects<br>
through the upper metallic cover, with<br><br>
PCT/DE2005/001435	- 7 -<br>
2005P13827WOIN<br>
a fixed contact piece being held fixed in position on the free<br>
side of the fixed contact bolt that is arranged in the vacuum<br>
housing. A moving contact piece, which is guided such that it<br>
can move longitudinally, is provided opposite the fixed contact<br>
piece and is held by means of a switching rod such that it can<br>
move. The switching rod passes through a metallic cover facing<br>
an output connection 8, with a metal bellows ensuring axial<br>
freedom of movement for the switching rod. A holding apparatus<br>
9 is in each case provided in order to hold the vacuum<br>
interrupter tube 6 both on its side facing the attachment web 4<br>
and on its side facing away from the attachment web 4. In this<br>
case, each of the holding apparatuses 9 have a mounting frame<br>
attachment 10, by means of which the respective holding<br>
apparatus 9 is anchored firmly on the mounting frame 2. The<br>
holding apparatus 9 is also equipped with field control<br>
elements, thus allowing the electrical field to be terminated.<br>
Each holding apparatus 9 expediently has a flat metallic<br>
holding section, on which the respective end face of the vacuum<br>
interrupter tube 6 rests. In this case, the vacuum interrupter<br>
tube 6 is conductively connected to the holding section. The<br>
holding section is surrounded by a flange section which extends<br>
at least in places at right angles to the holding section in<br>
the direction of the vacuum interrupter tube 6. In this case,<br>
the internal diameter of the flange section is somewhat larger<br>
than the external diameter of the end area of the vacuum<br>
interrupter tube 6 which rests on the holding section. The<br>
flange section therefore at least partially surrounds the end<br>
face of the vacuum interrupter tube 6, thus preventing the<br>
vacuum interrupter tube 6 from sliding off the holding<br>
apparatus 9. The flange section is conductively connected to<br>
the holding section and has a rounded shape, thus allowing<br>
field termination. The flange section is advantageously<br>
surrounded by thin-walled, non-conductive plastic insulation.<br><br>
PCT/DE2005/001435	- 8 -<br>
2005P13827WOIN<br>
In order to drive the moving contact piece, the switching rod<br>
can be connected via an expedient lever mechanism 11 to a drive<br>
which produces the kinetic energy required for switching.<br>
The mounting frame 2, which is formed integrally in the<br>
illustrated exemplary embodiment, therefore has two side walls<br>
12, 13 which run essentially parallel to one another. The side<br>
walls 12, 13 are connected to one another via the attachment<br>
web 4 and, in the lower area, by the bottom web 14. A lateral<br>
web 15 is provided for attachment of the output connection 8<br>
and its flat face is aligned towards the front face of the<br>
switch pole 1, from which it is accessible from the output<br>
connection 8. Outer ribs 16 are arranged between the lateral<br>
web 15 and the bottom web 14, increasing the creepage distance<br>
for a current on its way from the output connecting piece 8 to<br>
a point which is at ground potential.<br>
For attachment of additional isolating parts, which are not<br>
shown in Figure 1, each of the side walls 12 and 13 has<br>
latching grooves 17, which extend on the end face of each side<br>
wall 13 and 12 of the mounting frame 2 in its longitudinal<br>
direction, that is to say upwards. Furthermore, stop shoulders<br>
are provided, which cannot be seen in Figure 1, but which will<br>
be described in more detail in the following text.<br>
Figure 2 shows the exemplary embodiment from Figure 1 with<br>
additional isolating parts 18 and 19 pushed into the latching<br>
grooves 17 and onto the stop shoulders. The additional<br>
isolating part 19 is intended for shielding of the rear area of<br>
the switch pole 1, with the additional isolating part 18 being<br>
inserted into the latching grooves 17 in the front area. The<br>
additional isolating parts 18 and 19 have a cross section with<br>
a U-profile, in which, as<br><br>
PCT/DE2005/001435	- 9 -<br>
2005P13827WOIN<br>
can be seen, the free limbs of the U-profile extend well into<br>
the retaining grooves 17, thus forming a labyrinth structure<br>
which considerably increases the creepage distance.<br>
Furthermore, the front additional isolating part 18 has a<br>
tubular connecting stub 2 0 which opens immediately in front of<br>
the input connection into the shielding wall area of the<br>
additional isolating part 18, so that the connecting area<br>
between the input connection and a conductor inserted into the<br>
tubular connecting stub 2 0 is electrically isolated. A<br>
corresponding situation applies to the tubular connecting stub<br>
21 which opens at the same height as the output connection into<br>
the shielding wall section of the additional isolating part 18.<br>
Figure 3 shows a cross-sectional view of the switch pole from<br>
Figure 2. This shows particularly clearly that the input<br>
connection 3 and the output connection 8 are arranged at the<br>
same height as the respective connecting stub 20 or 21. The<br>
figure also shows that a switching rod 22, which is guided such<br>
that it can move in the longitudinal direction, passes through<br>
the lower end face of the vacuum interrupter tube 6, with the<br>
switching rod 22 being connected to the output connection 8 via<br>
a flexible connecting strip 23. A pot-type isolator 24 is<br>
provided in order to isolate the lever mechanism 11, which is<br>
at ground potential, from the switching rod 22 which is at<br>
high-voltage potential, which pot-type isolator 24 is very well<br>
known per se to those skilled in the art, so that its<br>
configuration and method of operation do not need to be<br>
described in detail at this point. As can also be seen, the<br>
vacuum interrupter tube 6 is attached directly to the input<br>
connection 3 through the aperture opening 5 in the attachment<br>
web 4. As can also be seen in the illustrated cross-sectional<br>
view, the input connection 3 has a longitudinal section 3a in<br>
addition to the pole-head section 3b, with the pole-head<br>
section 3b being screwed to the attachment web 4. The distance<br>
between the connecting area<br><br>
PCT/DE2005/001435	- 10 -<br>
2005P13827WOIN<br>
of the input connection 3 and the connecting area of the output<br>
connection 8, in other words the gap width of the switch pole,<br>
can be determined via the length of the longitudinal section<br>
3a. The end face of the vacuum interrupter tube 6 facing the<br>
pole-head section 3b is once again surrounded by the flange<br>
section of a holding apparatus 9, which is designed to center<br>
the vacuum interrupter tube 6 and for field termination.<br>
Figure 4 shows a front view of	the switch pole from Figure 3,<br>
in which the input connection 3	and the output connection 8 can<br>
be seen through the tubular	connecting stubs 2 0 and 21,<br>
respectively.<br>
Figure 5 shows the switch pole 1 from Figure 4 in a view<br>
sectioned along the line V, showing the position of the ceramic<br>
housing 7 of the vacuum interrupter tube 6. The figure also<br>
shows how the free limbs 25 of the isolating part 18, which has<br>
a U-profiled cross-section, project into the latching grooves<br>
17 in the mounting frame 2. In this case, the free limbs 25 are<br>
spread outwards, so that the restoring force of the free limbs<br>
25 produces a force fit for the isolating part 18 in the<br>
mounting frame 2. Furthermore, stop shoulders 26 can be seen on<br>
the respective side wall 12 and 13 of the mounting frame 2, on<br>
the ends of which the free limbs 25 of the isolating part 19<br>
rest, with the free limbs 25 of the additional isolating part<br>
19, which has a U-profiled cross section, being pressed<br>
together beyond their equilibrium position, so that the<br>
isolating part 19 is also held on the mounting frame 2 by the<br>
restoring force of the free limbs 25.<br><br>

latching means (17, 26) extend in the longitudinal direction on<br>
the side walls (12, 13).<br>
6.	The switch pole (1) as claimed in one of the preceding<br>
claims, characterized in that the additional isolating parts<br>
have a cross section with a U-profile, at least in places.<br>
7.	The switch pole (1) as claimed in claim 6, characterized<br>
in that the free limbs (25) of the U-profile are inserted, in<br>
the installed state, at the end into latching grooves (17) in<br>
the mounting frame (2).<br>
8.	The switch pole (1) as claimed in claim 6, characterized<br>
in that the free limbs (25) of the U-profile rest at the end,<br>
in the installed state, on stop shoulders (26) which are formed<br>
in the side walls (12, 13) and their outer faces are pressed<br>
against inner faces of the side walls (12, 13), so as to<br>
produce a force fit between the additional isolating part (19)<br>
and the mounting frame (2) .<br>
9.	The switch pole (1) as claimed in one of the preceding<br>
claims, characterized in that the additional isolating parts<br>
(12, 13) have tubular connecting stubs (20, 21) at least in<br>
places which, in the installed state, extend in front of the<br>
input connection (3) and/or the output connection (8).<br><br>
In order to provide a switch pole (1)<br>
for interrupting an alternating electrical current with a<br>
supporting frame (2), which is manufactured from an insulating material,<br>
and an interrupter (6), which extends in a longitudinal direction within<br>
the supporting frame (2) between an input connection (3) and<br>
an output connection (8) and is designed to interrupt the alternating<br>
current between the input connection (3) and the output connection<br>
(8), the input connection (3), the output connection (8)<br>
and the interrupter (6) being held by the supporting frame (2)<br>
which switch pole has a supporting frame whose insulating<br>
capacity can be matched in a simple manner to the requirements<br>
placed respectively on the switch pole (1), the invention<br>
proposes that the supporting frame (2) has latching means (17,26)<br>
for accommodating additional insulating parts (18,19)<br>
with which the insulating capacity of the supporting<br>
frame (2) is increased.<br></td>
