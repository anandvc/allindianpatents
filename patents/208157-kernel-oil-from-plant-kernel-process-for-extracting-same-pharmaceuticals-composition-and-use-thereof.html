The walnut kernel is one of the Chinese traditional medicines for both medical-and food-purpose, and has functions of nourishing the kidney, wanning the lung and moistening the bowel. However, walnut kernel oil has usually been used as an edible oil and has not been reported as a parenteral nutritional agent. The common walnut kernel oil preparation is not advantageous to human absorption, and its medical application is restricted since it is difficult for it to meet the clinic requirements as an intravenous emulsion. The backward technology of extraction and separation in the prior art induces in unqualified chemical and physical properties (such as acid value) and high impurity contents.<br>
In the prior art, the fat emulsions prepared from the soya bean oil, the cotton seed oil and the red flower oil are commonly used to replenish nutrients and energy to human body. The fat emulsion made from soya bean oil is more widely used. However, no work on the improvement of immunological functions, the increase of serum proteins, the inhibition on transplanted tumor, experimental Lewis lung cancer<br><br>

The heat value of the walnut kernel oil of the invention, measured according to GB384-81, is 37599 KJ/kg, equivalent to that of Soya bean (37243 KJ/kg), and the heat value of the walnut kernel oil emulsion is 6303 KJ/kg.<br>
Test example 3   Tests of anoxia tolerance and fatigue endurance in mice 40 male healthy mice were divided randomly into 4 groups on basis of body weights, 10 for each. Three groups accepted walnut kernel oil emulsion in doses of 2Sml/kg,  12.5ml/kg and 6\25ml/kg, respectively. A normal saline (NS) group<br><br>
accepted same volume of normal saline. All the test materials were injected via tail vein, once a day for 7 days, and tests were conducted 2 hours after the last injection.<br>
Test of anoxia tolerance<br>
Each tested mouse was put in a 250 ml colorless wide mouth bottle containing lOg of sodium lime. The duration was metered from the time the mouse was put into the bottle till its aspiration stopped. The mean survival times (min) were calculated and the differences between the emulsion groups and the normal saline group were compared.<br>
Test of fatigue endurance<br>
The mice were weighed respectively. Each mouse was loaded a weight of 5% of the body weight at its tail and immersed into a big vat in which the water temperature is 25 Â°C and the water depth is 40cm. The mice were forced to swim till they sank to the bottom and died. The swimming duration for each mouse was recorded (min). Data were analysed statistically using t-test. The differences between each emulsion groups and normal saline were compared.<br>

**p
It was shown from Table 4 and table 5 that the walnut kernel oil emulsion in the above doses inhibited HAC hepatic cancer and Lewis lung cancer in mice to some extent.<br>
It was found in further investigations that the emulsion made from the walnut kernel oil also had the above functions when it was used as an energy agent. It may be attributed to its functions of nourishing kidney, warming lung and loosening bowel.<br>
Possibility of industrial application<br>
The parental emulsion of the walnut kernel oil of the invention is formulated reasonable and the emulsifier used is safe and reliable. In addition to the functions of the supplement of nutrients and energy, the anoxia tolerance and the fatigue endurance, the increase of immune functions and increase of total serum proteins, it also inhibits HAC hepatic cancer and Lewis lung cancer in mice to some extent. Moreover, it possesses the functions of nourishing kidney, warming lung and loosening bowel, which are possessed by the raw material thereof. It is an energetic emulsion with various efficiencies, and can be used to treat tumors, venerisms, AIDS, hypoimmunity, infantile malnutrition, post-operation and diseases in need of supplementing fat elements. The kernel oils extracted by the method of the invention have good quality with<br><br>
a high yield and possess desired medical effects. Especially, by introducing nitrogen in the extraction process to protect the oil from oxidation, the quality of the kernel oils has been raised effectively.<br>
The biggest merit of the second method of the invention is that no organic solvent is used, so as to avoid pollution. The peroxide value of the kernel oil extracted can reach to less than 6.0 meq.kg"1 by using said method.<br><br>
