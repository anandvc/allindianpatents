				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a dielectric film structure having excellent dielectric property, -piezoelectric property, piezoelectric property and ferroelectric property and available as an element such as an actuator, a memory or a sensor.  Further, the present invention relates to a piezoelectric actuator having such a dielectric film structure. Furthermore, the present invention relates to an ink jet head utilizing such a piezoelectric actuator as a discharge pressure generating element for discharging liquid. Related Background Art<br>
Presently, a dielectric film structure having a dielectric film including    solution of lead titanate zirconate (Pb(Zr, Ti)03, PZT), barium titanate (BaTi03) , lead titanate zirconate - lead magnesium niobate (Pb(Zr, Ti)03 - Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)03, PZT -   PMN) has widely been used various elements such as actuators, memories and sensors by utilizing dielectric, piezoelectric, pyroelectric and ferroelectric properties thereof. At present, as<br><br>
electronic/electric equipment has been made compact and made to have a high function, there has been highly requested for compactness and a high integrating ability of the element itself.<br>
For example, a piezoelectric actuator having the dielectric film structure has been utilized as ink discharging means of an ink jet printer which has been popularized as an output device of a personal computer.<br>
Various types of ink jet heads utilizing the piezoelectric actuator are known. As such types, for example, there are a bi-morph type disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication No. S53-12138 (1978), a ,, uni-morph type disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication No. S62-22790 (1987) and a share mode type disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4584590, Japanese Patent Publication No. H7-33089 (1995) and U.S. Patent No. 5265315.<br>
Now, an ink jet head will be explained with reference to an ink jet head using a piezoelectric actuator of uni-morph type.  Fig. 4A is a perspective view of an ink jet head of uni-morph type and Fig. 4B is a sectional view taken along- the line 4B - 4B in -Fig. 4A.  The ink jet head mainly formed from three parts comprising a piezoelectric actuator 8, a flow path substrate 9 and a nozzle plate 10. A plurality of nozzles 3 are formed in the nozzle plate at<br>
	-<br><br>
predetermined pitch and pattern and each nozzle forms a discharge port at a back side of the flow path substrate, which is an opening through which ink is discharged.  Further, the nozzles correspond to respective actuator and ink pressurizing chambers 1 are formed in the flow path substrate in correspondence to the respective nozzles.<br>
The nozzle plate and the flow path substrate are joined together so that the nozzles are communicated with the corresponding ink pressurizing chambers.  Further, a common ink chamber 2 is formed in the flow path substrate and all plural ink pressurizing chambers are communicated with the common ink chamber.  One (ceiling portion in the drawings) of side walls of the ink pressurizing chamber 1 also acts as a vibrating plate 4 of the piezoelectric actuator. A lower electrode 5, a dielectric film 6 and an upper electrode 7 are laminated in order on the vibrating plate, thereby constituting the piezoelectric actuator.<br>
When the ink is discharged, the ink is supplied from the common ink chamber 2 to the ink pressurizing chamber 1 thereby to fill the ink pressurizing chamber 1.  In this condition, by applying voltage to the upper electrode 7 and the lower electrode 5 of the piezoelectric actuator 8, the dielectric film 6 can be contracted or expanded in a direction parallel<br><br>
to a surface of the film. As a result, the piezoelectric actuator 8 is flexed toward inside or outside of the ink pressurizing chamber 1.  For example, when the piezoelectric actuator is flexed toward the inside of the ink pressurizing chamber, the ink in the ink pressurizing chamber is pressurized, so that an ink droplet can be discharged from the nozzle by the pressure.<br>
The dielectric film of the ink jet head which has presently been popularized is normally formed by screen printing of piezoelectric ceramic paste.  The piezoelectric ceramic paste is obtained by adding a small amount of organic binder to raw material powder of piezoelectric material.  The piezoelectric ceramic paste is patterning-coated by screen printing on the lower electrode in correspondence to the ink pressurizing chambers formed at the predetermined pitch and, thereafter, sintering is performed, thereby obtaining a multi crystal dielectric film.<br>
However, in consideration of development of high density of nozzle arrangement and lengthening of the ink jet head (increase in the number of nozzles per one head), the method using the screen printing has the following problems.<br>
In a case where the high density of the nozzle arrangement in the ink jet head is sought, a width of the ink pressurizing chamber must be decreased<br><br>
accordingly and greater displacement of the piezoelectric actuator is required.  Accordingly, in order to achieve higher density of the nozzle arrangement, the dielectric film obtained by the screen printing may not provide a satisfactory piezoelectric property.<br>
Further, in the formation of the dielectric film by using the screen printing, in order to perform the sintering, a temperature range from 950°C to 1300°C and a time range from several ten minutes to several hours are reguired. A pattern of the dielectric film so obtained causes positional deviation from a pattern obtained at a time when the screen printing was performed due to volume contraction during the sintering.  Such positional deviation of the dielectric film may cause a great problem regarding influence upon a discharging property as higher density of the nozzle arrangement is achieved and the length of the ink jet head is increased.  Further, in general, although minute working of a silicon substrate using a semiconductor manufacturing technique is considered to be bright as means for achieving the high integrating ability of the ink pressurizing chambers, in a case where the dielectric film is formed by the screen printing, deterioration of the silicon substrate due to the heating during the sintering may not be avoided.<br><br>
In order to solve these problems, there has been developed a technique in which a temperature of a film forming condition is reduced by using a method such as a spattering method, a sol-gel method or an metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) method and the properties are improved by controlling a crystal structure of the dielectric film.<br>
For example, Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. H6-350154 (1994) discloses a dielectric (piezoelectric) film element in which lead titanate zirconate of rhombic crystalline system having (111) orientation greater than 70% is film-formed on a substrate by a spattering method and a dielectric (piezoelectric) film element in which lead titanate zirconate of square crystalline system having (001) orientation greater than 70% is film-formed on a substrate by a spattering method and teaches usage as a liquid jetting device.<br>
However, the dielectric film (piezoelectric) elements disclosed in this document have several problems.<br>
First of all, although the piezoelectric property thereof is improved in comparison with that of a sintering element of multi crystal lead titanate zirconate (PZT), in many cases, such piezoelectric property may be insufficient to realize an ink. jet printer having high density nozzle arrangement.<br><br>
Further, endurance of the dielectric: film element is smaller than that of a raulti crystal PZT sintering element and, if the dielectric film element is used repeatedly, the piezoelectric property thereof may be reduced considerably.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Ar object of the present invention is to provide a technique for achieving compactness and a high integrating ability of an element such as an actuator, a memory or a sensor by obtaining excellent dielectric, piezoelectric, pyroelectric and ferroelectric properties and, in particular, to provide a piezoelectric actuator which has properties superior to those of a conventional dielectric film comprised of multi crystal sintering element and has excellent endurance.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide an ink jet head having such a piezoelectric actuator and also having a structure suitable for achieving a high density nozzle arrangement and permitting lengthening of the head.<br>
A dielectric film structure according to a first invention is a dielectric film structure having a substrate and a dielectric film provided on the substrate and in which the dielectric film has (001) face orientation with respect to the substrate and in<br><br>
which a value u in the following equation (1) regarding the dielectric film is a real number greater than 2:<br>
u = (Ce/Ca) * (Wa/Wc)        ... (1)<br>
where, Cc is a count number (number of counts) of a peak of a (001') face of the dielectric film in an Out-of-plane X ray diffraction measurement (here, 1' is a natural number selected so that Cc becomes maximum); Ca is a count number of a peak of a (h'00) face of the dielectric film in an In-plane X ray diffraction measurement (here, h' is a natural number selected so that Cc becomes maximum) ; Wc is a half-value width of a peak of the (001') face of the dielectric film in an Out-of-plane rocking curve X ray diffraction measurement; and Wa is a half-value width of a peak of the (h'00) face of the dielectric film in an In-plane rocking curve X ray diffraction measurement.<br>
Regarding the count number and the half value width in the present invention, the explanation will be made using an. example of an X ray diffraction measurement chart (schematic view).  For example, if the Out-of-plane X ray diffraction measurement chart of the dielectric film structure according to the first invention is as shown in Figs. 5 and 6 (rocking curves), Cc is the count number of a PZT (002) peak and Wc is a half-value width of the PZT (002) peak.<br><br>
The dielectric film of the dielectric film structure according to the first invention is not necessarily provided on the substrate directly, and an intermediate layer (for example, buffer layer or electrode layer) may be included between the dielectric film and the substrate.  Further, a plurality of intermediate layers may be provided.<br>
The dielectric film structure according to the first invention achieves the excellent dielectric, piezoelectric, pyroelectric and ferroelectric properties since the dielectric film has the (001) face orientation with respect to the substrate and the crystal structure thereof is controlled so that the value u in the above equation (1) becomes the real number greater than 2, i.e. the crystal structure is controlled in a more preferable manner in a thickness direction of the dielectric film and a direction perpendicular thereto. By using the dielectric film having such a crystalline feature, in these properties, the dielectric film structure having properties superior to those of the conventional multi crystal dielectric film or the conventional dielectric film having (001) face orientation can be obtained.  Further, the dielectric film structure according to the first invention has excellent endurance and, thus, even when it is used repeatedly, deterioration of the properties does<br><br>
almost not occur.  In the dielectric film structure according to the first invention, preferably, the value u is the real number greater than 3 and, more preferably, the value u is the real number greater than 5, and, most preferably, the value u is the real number greater than 1.<br>
It is preferable that, in the dielectric film having the (00 1) face orientation according to the first invention, the count number of faces other than the (001) face is smaller than 10% of the count number of the (001'} face in the Out-of-plane X ray diffraction measurement and the count number of faces other than the (h00) face is smaller than 10* of the count number of the (h'00) face in the In-plane X ray diffraction measurement. However, h and 1 are any natural numbers and 1' is a natural number selected so that the count number of the peak of the (00 1') face becomes maximum in the Out-of-plane X ray diffraction measurement and h is a natural number selected so that the count number of the peak of the (h'00) face becomes maximum in the In-plane X ray diffraction measurement. Preferably, these are smaller than 5% and mote preferably smaller than 1%. Incidentally, regarding the (001) face and (h00) faces of the dielectric film in the present invention, when it is assumed that face index of the crystal is (hkl), a face parallel to the surface of the<br><br>
substrate is referred to as the (001) face and a face substantially perpendicular to the surface of the substrate is referred to as the (hOO) face.<br>
The dielectric film structure according to the first invention is preferably characterized in that the dielectric film includes three or more of Pb, Zr, Ti, Mg, Zn and Nb.  More preferably, the dielectric film mainly includes lead titanate zirconate.  With this arrangement, the excellent properties of the dielectric film structure can be achieved in a wide temperature range.<br>
In the dielectric film structure according to the first invention, preferably, a thickness of the dielectric film is greater than 10 nm and smaller than 20 μ m.  In this construction, by increasing the thickness of the dielectric film, electrical endurance is improved.  Further, the structure can be used in a wider voltage range.  Further, if the thickness of the dielectric film is too great, the film forming time will be increased.  Thus, this is not preferably in the viewpoint of manufacturing efficiency. More preferably, the thickness is greater than 100 nm and smaller than 15 μ m and, most preferably, the thickness is greater than 500 nm and smaller than 10 μ m.<br>
In the dielectric film structure according to the first invention, preferably, the crystal<br><br>
structure of the dielectric film is square crystal. By using the square crystal, a polarizing direction of the dielectric film can easily be aligned with the thickness direction.<br>
A piezoelectric actuator according to the first invention includes the above-mentioned dielectric film structure according to the first invention. Thus, since the piezoelectric property superior to that of the conventional piezoelectric actuator can be achieved, compactness and high integrating ability of the actuator can be realized.<br>
An ink jet head according to the first invention includes the above-mentioned piezoelectric actuator according to the first invention.  Thus, it is possible to achieve high density of the nozzle arrangement and to lengthen the ink jet head (to increase the number of nozzles per one head), with the result that a highly fine image can be obtained by using the ink jet head and a printing speed can be increased.<br>
In the dielectric film of the dielectric film structure according to the first invention, regarding the measurement value in the X ray diffraction, when<br>
the value u in the equation u = (Cc/Ca * (Wa/Wc) is the real number greater than 2 and preferably greater than 3 and more preferably greater than 5 and greater than 7, the excellent dielectric, piezoelectric,<br><br>
pyroelectric and ferroelectric properties can be achieved.  These properties are superior to those of the conventional multi crystal dielectric film or the conventional dielectric film having the (001} face orientation can be obtained.  Further, the dielectric film structure has excellent endurance and, thus, even when it is used repeatedly, the deterioration of the properties does almost not occur.<br>
Although a mechanism for realizing the excellent properties of the dielectric film structure of the present invention is not made clear, the following mechanism can be considered.  First of all, it is considered that the crystal orientation of the dielectric film is not random unlike to that of the normal multi crystal and is aligned in the thickness direction and in-plane direction.  Thus, the function of the dielectric film is not dispersed in various directions but is concentrated in a particular direction, thereby obtaining a great effect.<br>
Next, an arrangement of regularly lined-up crystal grating of the dielectric film of the present invention will be fully considered. Although such grating arrangement is generally lined up regularly, strictly speaking, it is known that the arrangement is not complete but there is slight distortion of crystal orientation.  Such distortion is observed as magnitude of a half-value width of a rocking curve in<br><br>
the X ray diffraction measurement.  In the dielectric film structure of the present invention, it is considered that the magnitude of the half-value width of the rocking curve of the crystal grating of the dielectric film is greater in the in-plane direction than the thickness direction so that a degree of freedom of the crystal grating is greater in the in-plane direction. As a result, a mechanism in which displacement of constitutional ions in the dielectric crystal, on which the dielectric, piezoelectric, pyroelectric and ferroelectric properties are based, can occur very easily, thereby realizing the excellent properties of the present invention is supposed.<br>
Incidentally, although a condition of the X ray diffraction measurement for seeking the value u in the above equation (1) is not limited to a special one, for example, a measurement condition in which a slit width is 0.2° to 1°, X ray tube voltage is 50 kV and X ray tube current is 40 mA.can be used.<br>

greater than 2:<br>
v = (C111/C-110) * (W-no/W111)        ... (2) where, Cm is a count number (number of counts) of a peak of a (111) face of the dielectric film in an Out-of-plane X ray diffraction measurement; C-110 is a count number of a peak of a (-110) face of the dielectric film in an In-plane X ray diffraction measurement; W111 is a half-value width of a peak of the (111) face of the dielectric film in an Out-of-plane rocking curve X ray diffraction measurement; and W_110 is a half-value width of a peak of the (-110) face of the dielectric film in an In-plane rocking curve X ray diffraction measurement.<br>

The dielectric film structure according to the second invention can achieve the excellent dielectric, piezoelectric, pyroelectric and ferroelectric<br><br>
properties since the dielectric film has the (111) face orientation with respect to the substrate and the crystal structure thereof is controlled so that the value v in the above equation (2) becomes the real number greater than 2, i.e. the crystal structure is controlled in a more preferable manner in a thickness direction and a direction perpendicular thereto.  By using the dielectric film having such a crystalline feature, in these properties, the dielectric film structure having properties superior to those of the conventional multi crystal dielectric film or the conventional dielectric film having the (111) face orientation can be obtained.

In the dielectric film structure according to the second invention, preferably, the value v is the real number greater than 3 and, more preferably, the value v is the real number greater than 5, and, most preferably, the value v is the real number greater than 7.<br>
It is preferable that, in the dielectric film having the (111) face orientation according to the second invention, the count number of faces not parallel to the (111) face is smaller than 10% of the<br><br>
count number of the fill) face in the Out-of-plane X ray diffraction measurement and the count number of faces not parallel to the (-110) face is smaller than 10% of the count number of the (-110) face in the In-plane X ray diffraction measurement.  Preferably, these are both smaller than 5% and more preferably smaller than 1%.<br>
The dielectric film structure according to the second invention is preferably characterized in that the dielectric film includes three or more of Pb, Zr, Ti, Mg, Zn and Nb.  More preferably, the dielectric film mainly includes lead titanate zirconate. With this arrangement, the excellent properties of the dielectric film structure can be achieved in a wide temperature range.<br>
In the dielectric film structure according to the second invention, preferably, a thickness of the dielectric film is greater than 10 nm and smaller than 20 urn.  In this construction, by increasing the thickness of the dielectric film, electrical endurance is improved.  Further, the structure can be used in a wider voltage range.  Further, if the thickness of the dielectric film is too great, the film forming time will be increased.  Thus, this is not preferably in the viewpoint of manufacturing efficiency. More preferably, the thickness is greater than 100 nm and smaller than 15 urn and, most<br><br>

A piezoelectric actuator according to the second invention includes the above-mentioned dielectric film structure according to the second invention.  Thus, since the piezoelectric property superior to that of the conventional piezoelectric actuator can be achieved, compactness and high integrating ability of the actuator can be realized.<br>
An ink jet head according to the second invention includes the above-mentioned piezoelectric actuator according to the second invention.  Thus, it is possible to achieve high density of the nozzle arrangement and to lengthen the ink jet head (to increase the number of nozzles per one head), with the result that a highly fine image can be obtained by using the ink jet head and a printing speed can be increased.<br>
In the dielectric film of the dielectric film structure according to the second invention, regarding the measurement value in the X ray<br><br>
diffraction, when the value v in the equation v = (C111/C-110) * (W-110/W11l is the real number greater than 2 and preferably greater than 3 and more preferably greater than 5 and greater than 7, the excellent dielectric, piezoelectric, pyroelectric and ferroelectric properties are achieved.  These properties are superior to those of the conventional multi crystal dielectric film or the conventional dielectric film having (111) face orientation can be obtained.  Further, the dielectric film structure has excellent endurance and, thus, even when it is used repeatedly, the deterioration of the properties does almost not occur.<br>
Although a mechanism for realizing the excellent properties of the dielectric film structure of the present invention is not made clear, the following mechanism can be considered.

Although such grating arrangement is generally lined up regularly, strictly speaking, it is known that the arrangement is not complete but there is slight distortion of crystal orientation.  Such distortion is observed as magnitude of a half-value width of a rocking curve in the X ray diffraction measurement.  In the dielectric film structure of the present invention, it is considered that the magnitude of the half-value width of the rocking curve of the crystal grating of the dielectric film is greater in the in-plane direction than the thickness direction so that a degree of freedom of the crystal grating is greater in the in-plane direction. As a result, a mechanism in which displacement of constitutional ions in the dielectric crystal, on which the dielectric, piezoelectric, pyroelectric and ferroelectric properties are based, can occur very easily, thereby realizing the excellent properties of the present invention is supposed.<br>
Incidentally, although a condition of the X ray diffraction measurement for seeking the value v in the above equation (2) is not limited to a special one, for example, a measurement condition in which a slit width is 0.2' to 1°, X ray tube voltage is 50 kV and X ray tube current is 40 mA can be used.<br>

in a thickness direction and a direction	<br>
perpendicular thereto.  By using the dielectric film<br>
having such a crystalline feature, in these<br>
properties, the dielectric film structure having<br>
properties superior to those of the conventional<br>
multi crystal dielectric film or the conventional<br>
dielectric film having the (110) face orientation can<br>
be obtained.  Further, the dielectric film structure<br>
according to the third invention has excellent<br>
endurance and, thus, even when it is used repeatedly,<br>
deterioration of the properties does almost not occur.<br>
In the dielectric film structure according to the<br>
third invention, preferably, the value w is the real<br>
number greater than 3 and, more preferably, the value<br>
w is the real number greater than 5, and, most<br>
preferably, the value w is the real number greater<br>
than 7.<br>
It is preferable that, in the dielectric film<br><br>
having the (110) face orientation according to the third invention, the count number of faces not parallel to the (110) face is smaller than 10% of the count number of the (110) face in the Out-of-plane X ray diffraction measurement and the count number of faces not parallel to the (-110) face is smaller than 10% of the count number of the (-110) face in the In-plane X ray diffraction measurement.  Preferably, these are both smaller than 5% and more preferably smaller than 1%.<br>
The dielectric film structure according to the third invention is preferably characterized in that the dielectric film includes three or more of Pb, Zr, Ti, Mg, Zn and Nb.  More preferably, the dielectric film mainly includes lead titanate zirconate. With this arrangement, the excellent properties of the dielectric film structure can be achieved in a wide temperature range.<br>
In the dielectric film structure according to ' the third invention, preferably, a thickness of the dielectric film is greater than 10 ran and smaller than 20 μ m.  In this construction, by increasing the thickness of the dielectric film, electrical endurance is improved.  Further, the structure can be used in a wider voltage range.  Further, if the thickness of the dielectric film is too great, the film forming time will be increased.  Thus, this is<br><br>
not preferably in the viewpoint of manufacturing efficiency. More preferably, the thickness is greater than 100 nm and smaller than 15 pm and, most preferably, the thickness is greater than 500 nm and smaller than 10 urn.<br>
A piezoelectric actuator according to the third invention includes the above-mentioned dielectric film structure according to the third invention. Thus, since the piezoelectric property superior to that of the conventional piezoelectric actuator can be achieved, compactness and high integrating ability of the actuator can be realized.<br>
An ink jet head according to the third invention includes the above-mentioned piezoelectric actuator according to the third invention. Thus, it is possible to achieve high density of the nozzle arrangement and to lengthen the ink jet head (to increase the number of nozzles per one head), with the result that a highly fine image can be obtained by using the ink jet head and a printing speed can be increased.<br>
In the dielectric film of the dielectric film structure according to the third invention, regarding the measurement value in the X ray diffraction, when the value w in the equation w = (C110/Coom) * (W00m/W110) is the real number greater than 2 and preferably greater than 3 and more preferably greater than 5 and<br><br>
greater than 7, the excellent dielectric, piezoelectric, pyroelectric and ferroelectric properties are achieved.  These properties are superior to those of the conventional multi crystal dielectric film or the conventional dielectric film having the (110) face orientation can be obtained. Further, the dielectric film structure has excellent endurance and, thus, even when it is used repeatedly, the deterioration of the properties does almost not occur.<br>
Although a mechanism for realizing the excellent properties of the dielectric film structure of the present invention is not made clear, the following mechanism can be considered.  First of all, it is considered that the crystal orientation of the dielectric film structure of the present invention is not random unlike to that of the normal multi crystal and is aligned in the thickness direction and in-plane direction.  Thus, the function of the dielectric film is not dispersed in various directions but is concentrated in a particular direction, thereby obtaining a great effect.<br>
Next, an arrangement of regularly lined-up crystal grating of the dielectric film of the present invention will be fully considered. Although such grating arrangement is generally lined up regularly, strictly speaking, it is known that the arrangement<br><br>
is not complete but there is slight distortion of crystal orientation.  Such distortion is observed as magnitude of a half-value width of a rocking curve in the X ray diffraction measurement.  In the dielectric film structure of the present invention, it is considered that the magnitude of the half-value width of the rocking curve of the crystal grating of the dielectric film is greater in the in-plane direction than the thickness direction so that a degree of freedom of the crystal grating is greater in the in-plane direction. A.s a result, a mechanism, in which displacement of constitutional ions in the dielectric crystal, on which the dielectric, piezoelectric, pyroelectric and ferroelectric properties are based, can occur very easily, thereby realizing the excellent properties of the present invention is supposed.<br>
Incidentally, although a condition of the X ray diffraction measurement for seeking the value w in the above equation (3) is not limited specially, for example, a measurement condition in which a slit width is 0.2° to 1°, X ray tube voltage is 50 kV and X ray tube current is 40 mA can be used.<br>
Since such a dielectric film structure of the present invention has the excellent dielectric, piezoelectric, pyroelectric and ferroelectric properties, compactness and a high integrating<br><br>
ability of an element such as an actuator, a memory and a sensor can be achieved.<br>
Further, the piezoelectric actuator of the present invention has both excellent piezoelectric property and endurance, so that the excellent piezoelectric property can be maintained for a long term.<br>
Furthermore, since the ink jet head of the present invention includes the above-mentioned piezoelectric actuator, the head provides excellent ink discharging ability and endurance and a lengthened ink jet head having a high density nozzle arrangement can be provided.<br>

In all of the embodiments 15 to 19, it was found that a peak of the maximum count number of the dielectric film in the Out-of-plane X ray diffraction measurement was a peak of a (110) face. Here, it is assumed that a maximum count number of a peak among peaks of faces not parallel to the (110) face is Cnll0 and a count number of a maximum peak among peaks of faces not parallel to a (001) face in the In-plane X ray diffraction measurement is dooi-In the Out-of-plane X ray diffraction measurement according to all of the embodiments 15 to 19, it was found that Cnll0 is smaller than 10% of Cn0.  In the In-plane X ray diffraction measurements according to all of the embodiments 15 to 19, it was found that Cnooi is smaller than 10% of C0oi -  Details regarding ratios of the count numbers Cnu0/Ciio and Cnooi/C00i are shown in the Table 14.  Further, Cn0, W110, C00i, W00i and w are shown in the following Table 13.<br>

Applied voltages, initial displacements, displacement amounts after 107 times endurance test and reduction ratios of the displacement amount after 107 times endurance test with respect to the initial displacement amount in this case are shown in the Table 14. Comparative examples 14 to 16<br>
Similar to processes in the embodiment 15, piezoelectric actuators of both-lever type for comparative examples 14 to 16 were manufactured by adjusting atmosphere and substrate temperature during the formation of the dielectric film and a cooling condition after the film formation.  Incidentally, when the dielectric film was formed, the cooling speed after the film formation was not controlled regarding a temperature smaller than 400°C and the pre-spattering was performed for 60 minutes at an electric power same as the RF applied electric power during the film formation.  Film thicknesses of the dielectric films and element ratios between zirconium and titanium are shown in the following Table 16. Results of Out-of-plane and In-plane X ray diffraction measurements are shown in the following Tables 15 and 16.<br>
