TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a motor provided with a stator, a rotor and a housing for holding them, which is used, for example, as a motor for running a vehicle. The housing has a control for supplying the motor coil with power and a sensor for detecting a position of the rotor disposed therein.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
As the running motors used for vehicles such as electric vehicles and electric scooters, a DC motor, a DC brushless motor and the like are used extensively. Generally, such a type of motor is configured by assembling a stator, a rotor and a housing for holding them, and the housing has therein a control for supplying the coil of the motor with power and a sensor for detecting a position of the rotor.<br>
It should be noted that the motors can now be available with higher revolutions and higher torque with advancement of a control technology and enhancement of the performance of permanent magnets. As a result, a delicate structure of individual parts of a motor, such as the coaxiality of the stator and the rotor and the heat radiation property of the control, has become more significant in order to secure its performance satisfactorily.<br>
In recent years, importance is now attached to spreading of electric vehicles, electric scooters and the like as a series of environmental measure, and the running motor is also required to be superior in productivity, of higher performance and<br><br>
inexpensiveness.<br>
The present invention has been made under the above-described circumstances and has an object to provide a rationally configured motor.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention recited in Claim 1 of the application relates to a motor provided with a stator, a rotor and a housing for holding them, wherein the rotor is provided with a laminated steel sheet in which rotor magnets are inserted and a support member which prevents the rotor magnets from coming out of the laminated steel sheet,â€¢ the laminated steel sheet includes a plurality of first steel sheets, each having a slot through which the rotor magnet is inserted and a second steel sheet to which the insertion ends of the rotor magnets are pressed/ and the plurality of first steel sheets and the second steel sheet have mutually the same contour and laminated with their contours aligned, and the motor is configured very rationally.<br>
Specifically, when the plurality of steel sheets configuring the laminated steel sheet are formed to have the slots and the rotor magnets are inserted into the slots, it is necessary to prevent the rotor magnets from coming out from either end of the laminated direction. Conventionally, a support member is disposed on each of both ends of the laminated direction, but the present invention has the second steel sheet at one end and the support member at the other end. Therefore, the support member at one end can be omitted, and component parts and assembling steps can be simplified.<br><br>
Especially, the first steel sheets and the second steel sheet have the same contour, so that there is an advantage that a common mold can be used to stamp them. Where the common mold is used, a press machine having a first stroke for stamping into the prescribed contour and a second stroke for boring the slots may be used to form the first steel sheets by the first and second strokes and to form the second steel sheet by the first stroke.<br>
Considering unnecessary leakage of magnetism or the like, a hole having a size through which the rotor magnets are not inserted may be formed in the second steel sheet.<br>
The invention described in Claim 2 of the application relates to a motor provided with a stator, a rotor and a housing for holding them, wherein the stator and the housing are assembled using a jig, the jig is provided with a stator support for supporting the stator and a housing positioning means for positioning the housing with respect to the stator, and the housing is positioned by the housing positioning means and assembled by fitting with the stator, and the motor is configured very rationally.<br>
Specifically, according to the invention, the housing is shrink-f itted to the stator using the jig provided with the stator support part and the housing positioning means, so that the stator and the housing can be assembled very accurately. Particularly, machining to form a key groove in the stator or the housing can be omitted.<br>
The invention described in Claim 3 of the application relates to a motor provided with a stator, a rotor and a housing for holding them, wherein the housing includes a first housing<br><br>
member and a second housing member, each having a bearing for supporting the rotor, the first housing member is provided with a recess for fitting the bearing therein, and the bearing is fixed by press-fitting a pipe of the same material as the first housing member into the recess, and the motor is configured very rationally.<br>
Specifically, Conventionally, the bearing is fixed with a retainer or by tightening a screw member. Meanwhile, the present invention fixes the bearing by press-fitting the pipe into the recess, so that it is advantageous in view of elimination of an error in fabrication size of each member and reduction of part costs,- and the bearing can be fixed accurately and easily. The pipe is inserted with force by a press machine or the like. And, it is considered that the pipe is desirably formed by extrusion molding.<br>
Besides, when the pipe is of the same material as the first housing member, an influence by the thermal expansion can be avoided. Specifically, when they are made of different materials, respectively, the pipe may become loose due to a difference in expansion coefficient if the motor coil generates heat, but such a disadvantage can be avoided without fail by the present invention.<br>
Particularly, when the end of the pipe is externally protruded from the housing, the protruded portion of the pipe can be used as a drive engine positioning means to connect the drive engine to the motor. Thus, this configuration makes it possible to secure the coaxial property of the motor and the drive engine with ease.<br><br>
The invention described in Claim 4 of the application relates to a motor provided with a stator, a rotor and a housing for holding them, wherein the housing includes a first housing member and a second housing member each having a bearing for supporting the rotor and a pin for mutually positioning the first housing member and the second housing member, the first housing member is formed a recess into which the pin is inserted, and the second housing member is formed a hole through which the pin is inserted, and the pin is formed a shoulder on its middle part to prevent the pin from coming out of the hole, and the motor is configured very rationally.<br>
Specifically, according to the invention, the second housing member is assembled to the first housing member with the hole aligned with the pin after inserting the pin into the first housing member. The pin as the positioning means is provided with the shoulder at its middle portion, so that there is no worry that the pin comes out because it is blocked by the second housing member. The first housing member and the second housing member are fixed by screwing or the like.<br>
The invention described in Claim 5 of the application relates to a motor provided with a stator, a rotor and a housing for holding them, wherein a control for supplying a coil of the motor with power is disposed within the housing, the housing includes a first housing member for covering the stator and the rotor, a second housing member for dividing the interior of the housing and a third housing member for covering the control, a through portion, through which wiring of the oil is passed, is disposed between the inner surface of the housing and the second<br><br>
housing member, and the second housing member has a holding surface for holding the wiring of the coil along the inner surface of the housing, and the motor is configured very rationally.<br>
Specifically, a mechanical stress applied to the wiring of the coil can be reduced because the holding surface for holding the wiring is disposed on the second housing member. Assuming that the wiring of the coil is swayed unstably due to the vibration of the motor, it causes increase of the mechanical stress. However, with the present invention, the mechanical stress can be reduced securely.<br>

are disposed within the housing, the housing includes a first housing member for covering the stator and the rotor, a second housing member for dividing the interior of the housing and a third housing member for covering the control, the second housing member has a through portion through which wiring of the sensor is inserted, and a shielding member which shields the through portion while allowing the passage of the wiring of the sensor, and the shielding member has a holding surface for holding the wiring of the sensor along the side wall of the second housing member, and the motor is configured very rationally.<br>
Specifically, the wiring of the sensor can be reduced a mechanical stress applied to it because the holding surface for holding the wiring is disposed on the shielding member.<br>
Assuming that the wiring of the sensor is swayed unstably within the housing due to the vibration of the motor, this causes increase of the mechanical stress. However, with the present invention, the mechanical stress can be reduced securely.<br>

Specifically, when the encoder magnet is supported by the rotor having the rotor magnets polarized, an angle of attaching the encoder magnet may be deviated subtly, but according to the present invention, the rotor magnets and the encoder magnet are polarized after the encoder magnet is supported by the rotor, so that the encoder magnet can be disposed very accurately, and it is possible to improve the accuracy of detecting a position of the rotor by the sensor.<br>
Especially, it is preferable that the rotor magnets and the encoder magnet are polarized with the polarization jigs for polarizing them integrated.<br>
The invention described in Claim 10 of the application relates to a motor provided with a stator, a rotor and a housing for holding them, wherein a control for supplying a coil of the<br><br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
An embodiment of the invention will be described in detail with reference to Fig. 1 to Fig. 23.<br>
A motor 100 of this embodiment is a 3-phase DC brushless motor for running, which is provided with a stator 200, a rotor 300 and a housing 400 for holding them and used for a vehicle drive engine. The housing 400 is configured by assembling a first housing member 410 covering the stator 200 and the rotor 300, a second housing member 420 dividing the inside of the housing and a third housing member 430 covering a control 500, together the first housing member 410, the second housing member 420 and the third housing member 430 are formed by molding an aluminum alloy. The housing 400 also has therein the control 500 for supplying a coil 210 or a stator coil of the motor 100 with power and a sensor 600 for detecting a position of the rotor 300 (see Fig. 1).<br>
The rotor 3 00 of this embodiment includes a laminated steel sheet 310 into which rotor magnets 320 are inserted and a support member 330 for preventing the rotor magnets 320 from separating from the laminated steel sheet 310 (see Fig. 2).<br>
The laminated steel sheet 310 includes a plurality of first steel sheets 311 each having slots 311a through which the rotor magnets 320 are inserted (see Fig. 3) and a second steel sheet 312 to which the inserting ends of the rotor magnets 320 are pressed (see Fig. 4). The plurality of first steel sheets 311 and the second steel sheet 312 are configured to have the same contour and laminated with their contours aligned.<br>
Specifically, the laminated steel sheet 310 of this embodiment is formed by laminating a plurality of steel sheets<br><br>
having the same contour, and the steel sheet of one end is the Â»<br>
second steel sheet 312 not having the slot 311a. The rotor magnets 320 are held between the second steel sheet 312 and the support member 330.<br>
The first steel sheets 311 and the second steel sheet 312 are produced by stamping using a common mold. A press machine used here is determined to have a first stroke for stamping their contours and a second stroke for boring the slots 311a. The first steel sheets 311 are produced by the first and second strokes, and the second steel sheet 312 is produced by the first stroke only.<br>
Considering the leakage or the like of unnecessary magnetism, the second steel sheet 312 may be formed holes 312a in a size through which the rotor magnets 320 cannot be inserted (see Fig. 5).<br>
The stator 200 and the housing 400 are assembled by a jig 710 (see Fig. 6). Specifically, the stator 200 having the coil 210 and the first housing member 410 are shrink-fitted.<br>
The jig 710 used here includes a stator support part 711 for supporting the stator 200 and housing positioning means for positioning the first housing member 410 with respect to the stator 200.<br>
An angle of attaching the stator 200 and the stator support part 711 with respect to the rotation direction of the motor 100 is determined by fitting a pin 711a attached to the stator support part 711 to a recess or the like of the stator 200.<br>
The housing positioning means of this embodiment has a first cylindrical part 712 which is inserted into the center of the first<br><br>
housing member 410 and a second cylindrical part 713 which is inserted through a through hole 410a formed in a relevant portion of the first housing member 410.<br>
The first housing member 410 is positioned by the housing positioning means and assembled by shrink-f itting with the stator 200 supported by the stator support part 711. Thus, the stator 200 and the housing 400 are assembled extremely accurately.<br>
In this embodiment, a bearing 401 for supporting the rotor 300 is disposed on the first housing member 410 and the second housing member 420.<br>
The first housing member 410 is formed a recess for fitting the bearing 401, and the bearing 401 is fixed by pressing in a pipe 412 of the same material (namely, an aluminum alloy) as the first housing member 410 into a recess 411 (see Fig. 7). The bearing 401 is held between the bottom of the recess 411 and the inserting end of the pipe 412. The pipe 412 is press-fitted by a press machine or the like. The pipe 412 is an extrusion-molded member.<br>
By configuring as described above, the bearing 401 is fixed accurately and easily. Especially, because the pipe 412 is made of the same material as the first housing member 410, there is no worry that the pipe 412 becomes loose or the like with the thermal expansion by heat generation of the coil 210.<br>
On the other hand, the bearing 401 attached to the second housing member 420 is set to have a small clearance in the axial direction of the rotor 300 with respect to the second housing nember 420, and a subtle dimensional difference between the rotor 300 and the housing 400 due to the thermal expansion is remedied<br><br>
,by virtue of the clearance.<br>
In this embodiment, an end of the pipe 412 is protruded externally to some extent from the housing 400. And, to couple the vehicle's drive engine to the motor 100, a protruded part 412a of the pipe 412 is used as drive unit positioning means.<br>
The first housing member 410 and the second housing member 420 are positioned by a pin 440 and assembled. More specifically, the first housing member 410 is formed a recess 413 in which the pin 440 is inserted, and the second housing member 420 is formed a hole 421 through which the pin 440 is inserted.
