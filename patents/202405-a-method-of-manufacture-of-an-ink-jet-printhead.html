The disclosures of these co-pending applications are incorporated herein by cross-reference. BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION<br>
Our co-pending US patent application serial no. 09/112,835 discloses a method of manufacture of a moving nozzle generally. Such a moving nozzle device is actuated by means of a magnetically responsive device for effecting displacement of the moving nozzle and, in so doing, to effect ink ejection. A problem with this arrangement is that it is required that parts of the device be hydrophobically treated to inhibit the ingress of ink into the region of the actuator. A method of manufacture of a moving nozzle-type device is proposed where the need for hydrophobic treatment is obviated. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to the invention, there is provided a method of manufacture of an ink jet printhead, comprising the steps of: providing a substrate; and creating an array of nozzle assemblies on the substrate with a nozzle chamber in communication with a nozzle opening of a nozzle of each nozzle assembly, the nozzle of each assembly being displaceable relative to the substrate for effecting ink ejection on demand and the nozzle assembly comprising an actuator unit connected to the nozzle and arranged externally of the chamber for controlling displacement of the nozzle.<br>
In this specification, the term "nozzle" is to be understood as an element defining an opening and not the opening itself.<br>
Preferably, the method includes creating said array by using planar monolithic deposition, lithographic and etching processes.<br><br>
Further, the method may include forming multiple printheads simultaneously on the substrate.<br>
The method may include forming integrated drive electronics on the same substrate. The integrated drive electronics may be formed using a CMOS fabrication process.<br>
The method may include forming a first part of a wall defining the chamber from a part of the nozzle and a second part of the wall from an inhibiting means, which inhibits leakage of ink from the chamber, the inhibiting means extending from the substrate. More particularly, the method may include, by deposition and etching processes, forming the inhibiting means to extend from the substrate.<br>
The method may include interconnecting the nozzle and the actuator unit by means of an arm such that the nozzle is cantilevered with respect to the actuator unit.<br>
The actuator unit may be a thermal bend actuator and the method may include forming the actuator from at least two beams, one being an active beam and the other being a passive beam. By "active" beam is meant that a current is caused to pass through the active beam for effecting thermal expansion thereof. In contrast, the "passive" beam, has no current flow therethrough and serves to facilitate bending of the active beam, in use.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
Referring initially to Figure 1 of the drawings, a nozzle assembly, in accordance with the invention is designated generally by the reference numeral 10. An ink jet printhead has a plurality of nozzle assemblies 10 arranged in an ink array 14 (Figures 5 and 6) on a silicon substrate 16. The array 14 will be described in greater detail below.<br>
The assembly 10 includes a silicon substrate or wafer 16 on which a dielectric layer 18 is deposited. A CMOS passivation layer 20 is deposited on the dielectric layer 18.<br>
Each nozzle assembly 10 includes a nozzle 22 defining a nozzle opening 24, a connecting member in the form of a lever arm 26 and an actuator 28. The lever arm 26 connects the actuator 28 to the nozzle 22.<br>
As shown in greater detail in Figures 2 to 4 of the drawings, the nozzle 22 comprises a crown portion 30 with a skirt portion 32 depending from the crown portion 30. The skirt portion 32 forms part of a peripheral wall of a nozzle chamber 34 (Figures 2 to 4 of the drawings). The nozzle opening 24 is in fluid communication with the nozzle chamber 34. It is to be<br><br>
noted that the nozzle opening 24 is surrounded by a raised rim 36 which "pins" a meniscus 38 (Figure 2) of a body of ink 40 the nozzle chamber 34.<br>
An ink inlet aperture 42 (shown most clearly in Figure 6 of the drawing) is defined in a floor 46 of the nozzle chamber 34. The aperture 42 is in fluid communication with an ink inlet channel 48 defined through the substrate 16.<br>
A wall portion 50 bounds the aperture 42 and extends upwardly from the floor portion 46. The skirt portion 32, as indicated above, of the nozzle 22 defines a first part of a peripheral wall of the nozzle chamber 34 and the wall portion 50 defines a second part of the peripheral wall of the nozzle chamber 34.<br>
The wall 50 has an inwardly directed lip 52 at its free end which serves as a fluidic seal which inhibits the escape of ink when the nozzle 22 is displaced, as will be described in greater detail below. It will be appreciated that, due to the viscosity of the ink 40 and the small dimensions of the spacing between the lip 52 and the skirt portion 32, the inwardly directed lip 52 and surface tension function as an effective seal for inhibiting the escape of ink from the nozzle chamber 34.<br>
The actuator 28 is a thermal bend actuator and is connected to an anchor 54 extending upwardly from the substrate 16 or, more particularly from the CMOS passivation layer 20. The anchor 54 is mounted on conductive pads 56 which form an electrical connection with the actuator 28.<br>
The actuator 28 comprises a first, active beam 58 arranged above a second, passive beam 60. In a preferred embodiment, both beams 58 and 60 are of, or include, a conductive ceramic material such as titanium nitride (TiN).<br>
Both beams 58 and 60 have their first ends anchored to the anchor 54 and their opposed ends connected to the arm 26. When a current is caused to flow through the active beam 58 thermal expansion of the beam 58 results. As the passive beam 60, through which there is no current flow, does not expand at the same rate, a bending moment is created causing the arm 26 and, hence, the nozzle 22 to be displaced downwardly towards the substrate 16 as shown in Figure 3 of the drawings. This causes an ejection of ink through the nozzle opening 24 as shown at 62 in Figure 3 of the drawings. When the source of heat is removed from the active beam 58, i.e. by stopping current flow, the nozzle 22 returns to its quiescent position as shown in Figure 4 of the drawings. When the nozzle 22 returns to its quiescent position, an ink droplet 64 is formed as a result of the breaking of an ink droplet neck as illustrated at 66 in Figure 4 of the drawings. The ink droplet 64 then travels on to the print media such as a sheet of paper. As a result of the formation of the ink droplet 64, a "negative" meniscus is formed as shown at 68 in Figure 4 of the drawings. This "negative" meniscus 68 results in an inflow of ink 40 into the nozzle chamber 34 such that a new meniscus 38 (Figure 2) is formed in readiness for the next ink drop ejection from the nozzle assembly 10.<br>
Referring now to Figures 5 and 6 of the drawings, the nozzle array 14 is described in greater detail. The array 14 is for a four color printhead. Accordingly, the array 14 includes four groups 70 of nozzle assemblies, one for each color. Each group 70 has its nozzle assemblies 10 arranged in two rows 72 and 74. One of the groups 70 is shown in greater detail in Figure 6 of the drawings.<br>
To facilitate close packing of the nozzle assemblies 10 in the rows 72 and 74, the nozzle assemblies 10 in the row 74 are offset or staggered with respect to the nozzle assemblies 10 in the row 72. Also, the nozzle assemblies 10 in the row 72 are spaced apart sufficiently far from each other to enable the lever arms 26 of the nozzle assemblies 10 in the row 74 to pass between adjacent nozzles 22 of the assemblies 10 in the row 72. It is to be noted that each nozzle assembly 10 is substantially dumbbell shaped so that the nozzles 22 in the row 72 nest between the nozzles 22 and the actuators 28 of adjacent nozzle assemblies 10 in the row 74.<br>
Further, to facilitate close packing of the nozzles 22 in the rows 72 and 74, each nozzle 22 is substantially hexagonally shaped.<br>
It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that, when the nozzles 22 are displaced towards the substrate 16, in use, due to the nozzle opening 24 being at a slight angle with respect to the nozzle chamber 34 ink is ejected slightly off the<br><br>
perpendicular. It is an advantage of the arrangement shown in Figures 5 and 6 of the drawings that the actuators 28 of the nozzle assemblies 10 in the rows 72 and 74 extend in the same direction to one side of the rows 72 and 74. Hence, the ink ejected from the nozzles 22 in the row 72 and the ink ejected from the nozzles 22 in the row 74 are offset with respect to each other by the same angle resulting in an improved print quality.<br>
Also, as shown in Figure 5 of the drawings, the substrate 16 has bond pads 76 arranged thereon which provide the electrical connections, via the pads 56, to the actuators 28 of the nozzle assemblies 10. These electrical connections are formed via the CMOS layer (not shown).<br>
Referring to Figure 7 of the drawings, a development of the invention is shown. With reference to the previous drawings, like reference numerals refer to like parts, unless otherwise specified.<br>
In this development, a nozzle guard 80 is mounted on the substrate 16 of the array 14. The nozzle guard 80 includes a body member 82 having a plurality of passages 84 defined therethrough. The passages 84 are in register with the nozzle openings 24 of the nozzle assemblies 10 of the array 14 such that, when ink is ejected from any one of the nozzle openings 24, the ink passes through the associated passage before striking the print media.<br>
The body member 82 is mounted in spaced relationship relative to the nozzle assemblies 10 by limbs or struts 86. One of the struts 86 has air inlet openings 88 defined therein.<br>
In use, when the array 14 is in operation, air is charged through the inlet openings 88 to be forced through the passages 84 together with ink travelling through the passages 84.<br>
The ink is not entrained in the air as the air is charged through the passages 84 at a different velocity from that of the ink droplets 64. For example, the ink droplets 64 are ejected from the nozzles 22 at a velocity of approximately 3m/s. The air is charged through the passages 84 at a velocity of approximately lm/s.<br>
The purpose of the air is to maintain the passages 84 clear of foreign particles. A danger exists that these foreign particles, such as dust particles, could fall onto the nozzle assemblies 10 adversely affecting their operation. With the provision of the air inlet openings 88 in the nozzle guard 80 this problem is, to a large extent, obviated.<br>
Referring now to Figures 8 to 10 of the drawings, a process for manufacturing the nozzle assemblies 10 is described.<br>
Starting with the silicon substrate or wafer 16, the dielectric layer 18 is deposited on a surface of the wafer 16. The dielectric layer 18 is in the form of approximately 1.5 microns of CVD oxide. Resist is spun on to the layer 18 and the layer 18 is exposed to mask 100 and is subsequently developed.<br>
After being developed, the layer 18 is plasma etched down to the silicon layer 16. The resist is then stripped and the layer 18 is cleaned. This step defines the ink inlet aperture 42.<br>
In Figure 8b of the drawings, approximately 0.8 microns of aluminum 102 is deposited on the layer 18. Resist is spun on and the aluminum 102 is exposed to mask 104 and developed. The aluminum 102 is plasma etched down to the oxide layer 18, the resist is stripped and the device is cleaned. This step provides the bond pads and interconnects to the ink jet actuator 28. This interconnect is to an NMOS drive transistor and a power plane with connections made in the CMOS layer (not shown).<br>
Approximately 0.5 microns of PECVD nitride is deposited as the CMOS passivation layer 20. Resist is spun on and the layer 20 is exposed to mask 106 whereafter it is developed. After development, the nitride is plasma etched down to the aluminum layer 102 and the silicon layer 16 in the region of the inlet aperture 42. The resist is stripped and the device cleaned.<br>
A layer 108 of a sacrificial material is spun on to the layer 20. The layer 108 is 6 microns of photo-sensitive polyimide or approximately 4 urn of high temperature resist. The layer 108 is softbaked and is then exposed to mask 110 whereafter it is developed. The layer 108 is then hardbaked at 400Â°C for one hour where the layer 108 is comprised of polyimide or at greater than 300Â°C where the layer 108 is high temperature resist. It is to be noted in the drawings that the<br><br>
pattern-dependent distortion of the polyimide layer 108 caused by shrinkage is taken into account in the design of the mask 110.<br>
In the next step, shown in Figure 8e of the drawings, a second sacrificial layer 112 is applied. The layer 112 is either 2 um of photo-sensitive polyimide which is spun on or approximately 1.3 urn of high temperature resist. The layer 112 is softbaked and exposed to mask 114. After exposure to the mask 114, the layer 112 is developed. In the case of the layer 112 being polyimide, the layer 112 is hardbaked at 400Â°C for approximately one hour. Where the layer 112 is resist, it is hardbaked at greater than 300Â°C for approximately one hour.<br>
A 0.2 micron multi-layer metal layer 116 is then deposited. Part of this layer 116 forms the passive beam 60 of the actuator 28.<br>
The layer 116 is formed by sputtering 1,000A of titanium nitride (TiN) at around 300Â°C followed by sputtering 50 A of tantalum nitride (TaN). A further 1,000A of TiN is sputtered on followed by 50A of TaN and a further 1,000A of TiN.<br>
Other materials which can be used instead of TiN are TiB2, MoSi2 or (Ti, A1)N.<br>
The layer 116 is then exposed to mask 118, developed and plasma etched down to the layer 112 whereafter resist, applied for the layer 116, is wet stripped taking care not to remove the cured layers 108 or 112.<br>
A third sacrificial layer 120 is applied by spinning on 4 um of photo-sensitive polyimide or approximately 2.6 um high temperature resist. The layer 120 is softbaked whereafter it is exposed to mask 122. The exposed layer is then developed followed by hard baking. In the case of polyimide, the layer 120 is hardbaked at 400Â°C for approximately one hour or at greater than 300Â°C where the layer 120 comprises resist.<br>
A second multi-layer metal layer 124 is applied to the layer 120. The constituents of the layer 124 are the same as the layer 116 and are applied in the same manner. It will be appreciated that both layers 116 and 124 are electrically conductive layers.<br>
The layer 124 is exposed to mask 126 and is then developed. The layer 124 is plasma etched down to the polyimide or resist layer 120 whereafter resist applied for the layer 124 is wet stripped taking care not to remove the cured layers 108, 112 or 120. It will be noted that the remaining part of the layer 124 defines the active beam 58 of the actuator 28.<br>
A fourth sacrificial layer 128 is applied by spinning on 4 um of photo-sensitive polyimide or approximately 2.6um of high temperature resist. The layer 128 is softbaked, exposed to the mask 130 and is then developed to leave the island portions as shown in Figure 9k of the drawings. The remaining portions of the layer 128 are hardbaked at 400Â°C for approximately one hour in the case of polyimide or at greater than 300Â°C for resist.<br>
As shown in Figure 81 of the drawing a high Young"s modulus dielectric layer 132 is deposited. The layer 132 is constituted by approximately 1 um of silicon nitride or aluminum oxide. The layer 132 is deposited at a temperature below the hardbaked temperature of the sacrificial layers 108,112,120,128. The primary characteristics required for this dielectric layer 132 are a high elastic modulus, chemical inertness and good adhesion to TiN.<br>
A fifth sacrificial layer 134 is applied by spinning on 2um of photo-sensitive polyimide or approximately 1.3um of high temperature resist. The layer 134 is softbaked, exposed to mask 136 and developed. The remaining portion of the layer 134 is then hardbaked at 400Â°C for one hour in the case of the polyimide or at greater than 300Â°C for the resist.<br>
The dielectric layer 132 is plasma etched down to the sacrificial layer 128 taking care not to remove any of the sacrificial layer 134.<br>
This step defines the nozzle opening 24, the lever arm 26 and the anchor 54 of the nozzle assembly 10.<br>
A high Young"s modulus dielectric layer 138 is deposited. This layer 138 is formed by depositing 0.2um of silicon nitride or aluminum nitride at a temperature below the hardbaked temperature of the sacrificial layers 108, 112, 120 and 128.<br><br>
Then, as shown in Figure 8p of the drawings, the layer 138 is anisotropically plasma etched to a depth of 0.35 microns. This etch is intended to clear the dielectric from all of the surface except the side walls of the dielectric layer 132 and the sacrificial layer 134. This step creates the nozzle rim 36 around the nozzle opening 24 which "pins" the meniscus of ink, as described above.<br>
An ultraviolet (UV) release tape 140 is applied. 4um of resist is spun on to a rear of the silicon wafer 16. The wafer 16 is exposed to mask 142 to back etch the wafer 16 to define the ink inlet channel 48. The resist is then stripped from the wafer 16.<br>
A further UV release tape (not shown) is applied to a rear of the wafer 16 and the tape 140 is removed. The sacrificial layers 108, 112,120,128 and 134 are stripped in oxygen plasma to provide the final nozzle assembly 10 as shown in Figures 8r and 9r of the drawings. For ease of reference, the reference numerals illustrated in these two drawings are the same as those in Figure 1 of the drawings to indicate the relevant parts of the nozzle assembly 10.

WE CLAIM:<br>
1.	A method of manufacture of an ink jet printhead, comprising the steps of:<br>
providing a substrate; and<br>
creating an array of nozzle assemblies on the substrate with a nozzle chamber in communication with a nozzle opening of a nozzle of each nozzle assembly, the nozzle of each assembly being displaceable relative to the substrate for effecting ink ejection on demand and the nozzle assembly comprising an actuator unit connected to the nozzle and arranged externally of the chamber for controlling displacement of the nozzle.<br>
2.	The method as claimed in Claim 1, which comprises creating said array by using planar monolithic deposition, lithographic and etching processes.<br>
3.	The method as claimed in Claim 1, which comprises forming multiple printheads simultaneously on the substrate.<br>
4.	The method as claimed in Claim 1, which comprises forming integrated drive electronics on the same substrate.<br>
5.	The method as claimed in Claim 4, which comprises forming the integrated drive electronics using a CMOS fabrication process.<br>
6.	The method as claimed in Claim 1, which comprises forming a first part of a wall defining the chamber from a part of the nozzle and a second part of the wall from an inhibiting means, which inhibits leakage of ink from the chamber, the inhibiting means extending from the substrate.<br>
7.	The method as claimed in Claim 1, which comprises interconnecting the nozzle and the actuator unit by means of an arm such that the nozzle is cantilevered with respect to the actuator unit.<br><br>
8.	The method as claimed in Claim 1, in which the actuator unit is a thermal bend<br>
actuator, and in which the method comprises forming the actuator from at least two beams,<br>
one being an active beam and the other being a passive beam.<br>
