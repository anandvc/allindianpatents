pyrophyllite is used in the field of ceramics and remaining portion is used as filler in<br>
pesticide, soap and insecticide industries due to inherent dullness of the materials<br>
and presence of ferruginous minerals as impurities.<br>

The minimum acceptable value of "brightness" for paper, paint and textile industries<br>
is 75. Reference for which may be made to Guha S. K., Das S. R. and Sen Sudhir,"<br>

vol. 27(2)(1968).<br>
The main draw backs of the hitherto known prior art methods are:<br>
1. High cost of the chemicals.<br>
2. Complicated chemical process involved.<br>
3. Prohibitive in respect of consumption of chemical or other accessories.<br>
4. High cost of final product for use in paper, paint and textile industries.<br>
5. Process is limited to Kaolinitic clay minerals which are essentially 1:1 layer lattice<br>
mineral.<br>
No work has so far been reported which deals with 1:2 layer lattice clay mineral such<br>
as pyrophyllite. Pyrophyllite is much cheaper than the conventionally used clay<br>
minerals.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a process of beneficiation of<br>
pyrophyllite for increasing brightness value above 80.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a process to increase the<br>
brightness of pyrophyllite for its use in industries such as paper, paint, textile and<br>
ceramics.<br>
Large deposits of pyrophyllite are available with rather limited use, at present.<br>
Brightness of this pyrophyllite is very low i.e., less than 50. Both clay and pyrophyllite<br>
have layer lattice structure. However clay is essentially 1:1 layer lattice mineral<br>
where one tetrahedral silica layer is attached with an octahedral alumina layer.<br>
Pyrophyllite on the other hand is 1:2 layer lattice mineral where one octahedral<br>
alumina layer is sandwiched between two silica layers. Most of the substitution<br>
occurs in this octahedral layer and Al+3 is mostly substituted by Fe+3. This makes the<br>
Fe+3 ions more firmly attached to the structure and can not easily be removed by<br>
chemicals. On reducing the particle size of pyrophyllite to the threshold limit, this 1: 2 alumino silicate layer lattice mineral may be made more reactive and structural iron is rather easily removed.<br>
In the present invention there is provided a process of beneficiation of pyrophyllite for increasing brightness value above 80, for its possible use in paper, paint, textile industries. At present these industries use essentially selected kaolinitic minerals, a 1:1 layer lattice mineral, the source of which is fast depleting. The process involves less consumption of chemicals as compared to that of kaolinitic mineral. The process is cost effective as kaoline is far more costly and the process of this invention adds value to the pyrophyllite making it suitable for more valuable use.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a process of beneficiation of pyrophyllite for increasing brightness value above 80, which comprises milling of crushed pyrophyllite lumps for a period in the range of 6 to 48 hours by conventional methods to obtain milled pyrophyllite, wherein the cumulative percentage of pyrophyllite particles finer than 10 µm is above 80% and the average particle size of the ground material is in the range of 4 to 6 µm, removing the elemental iron present in the milled pyrophyllite by conventional processes, treating the milled pyrophyllite with a leaching agent in the range of 1-5%, selected from a group of organic acids, inorganic acids, peroxides and borax for 24 to 60 hours to obtain a chemically leached milled pyrophyllite, filtering the chemically leached pyrophyllite to obtain a filter cake and washing with distilled water, drying the filter cake at a temperature in the range of 110 to 120 °C for a period of 12 to 48 hours.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention leaching agent selected from inorganic acid is preferably hydrochloric acid in the range of 3-15% or sulphuric acid in the range of 1-5%, organic acid is preferably oxalic acid in the range of 0-10%, peroxides is preferably hydrogen peroxide in the range of 0-10% or borax in the range of 1-5%.<br><br>
When the fineness is increased by ball milling or pot milling with water, the brightness value of ground pyrophyllite may be increased upto the value of 68 which is due to the fact that by ball milling the average particle size of the milled material may be attained in the range of 18 to 20  µm. The ground pyrophyllite was again milled in vibro mill or attrition mill with water for 6 to 16 hours so that the fineness was increased and the cumulative percentage of particle finer than 10 µm was above 80% as well as the average particle size of the ground material varied between 4 to 6 µm. The brightness value of the above material was 78. When the above milled pyrophyllite was treated with 0 to 15% of hydrochloric acid, 0 to 5% of sulphuric acid, 0 to 10% of oxalic acid, 0 to 5% of hydrogen peroxide along with 0 to 5 % of borax and the material was left for 24 to 60 hours for ageing and finally filtered and washed with distilled water, the brightness value increased to 84.<br>
The main novelty of the process of the present invention lies in the starting material, pyrophillite. Further, the novelty of the present invention is to provide pyrophillite having increased brightness value above 80 which is used for paper, paint, textile, pottery, tiles, refractories and cement industries.<br>
The inventive steps which brings about the novel features of the present invention lies in reducing the particle size so that the cumulative percentage of particle finer than 10  µm was above 80% as well as the average particle size of the ground pyrophyllite varied between 4 to 6  µm to predetermined level followed by chemical leaching of ferruginous impurities present in the mineral.<br>
The details of the process steps of the present invention are given below:<br>
a)	The deposited raw lump pyrophyllite was first jaw crushed.<br>
b)	The crushed pyrophyllite of step 'a' was further milled by conventional processes such as pot milling, ball milling, vibro milling, attrition milling for 6 to 48 hours.<br><br>
s<br>
c) The elemental iron present in the milled pyrophyllite of step 'b' was removed by<br>
conventional processes.<br>
d) The particle size for the material collected from step 'c' was measured. The<br>
accepted cumulative percentage of the particle finer than 10 urn was above 80%<br>
and the average particle size of the milled material was 4 to 6 um.<br>
e) The material of step 'd' was now treated with 0 to 15% of hydrochloric acid, 0 to<br>
5% of sulphuric acid, 0 to 10% of oxalic acid or 0 to 5% of hydrogen peroxide along<br>
with 0 to 5 % of borax and kept the slurry for 24 to 60 hours for ageing.<br>
f) Treated material of step 'e' was filtered and washed with distilled water,<br>
g) The washed material collected from step T was dried at 110 to 120°C for 12 to<br>
48 hours.<br>
h) The brightness value of the dried material of step 'g' was measured.<br>
