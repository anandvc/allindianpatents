INTRADERMAL NEEDLE<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001]	The present invention generally relates Jo a needle assembly attachable to<br>
a prefillable container for delivering substances such as drugs, vaccines and the like used in the prevention, diagnosis, alleviation, treatment, or cure of disease into the skin of an animal using an injection device having a needle cannula and a limiter for engaging the surface of the skin and limiting penetration of the tip of the needle cannula into the skin. Preferably, the limiter limits penetration of the needle cannula from approximately 1.0 mm to approximately 2.0 mm, and most preferably around 1.5 mm Â± 0.2 mm to 0.3 mm, such that the substance is injected into the dermis layer of the animal. The orientation of the needle cannula is fixed so that the needle cannula is preferably generally perpendicular to the plane of the skin engaging surface of the limiter within about fifteen degrees or more preferably ninety degrees within about five degrees, and the skin engaging surface is generally flat<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]	Intradermal injections are used for delivering a variety of substances.<br>
Many of these substances have proven to be more effectively absorbed into or react with<br>
the immune response system of the body when injected intradermally. Recently, clinical<br>
trials have shown hepatitis B vaccines administered intradermally are more imunogenic<br>
than if administered intramuscularly. In addition, substances have been injected<br>
intradermally for diagnostic testing, such as, for example using what is known in the art<br>
as the "Mantoux test*' to determine the immunity status of the animal against tuberculosis<br>
and the immediate hypersensitivity status of Type I allergic diseases. It is desirable, in<br>
some instances, to provide a prefilled container filled with one of these substances and to<br>
mate the needle cannula to the container just prior to administering the injection.<br>
[0003]	An intradermal injection is made by delivering the substance into the<br>
epidermis and upper layer of the dermis. Below the dermis layer is subcutaneous tissue (also sometimes referred to as the hypodermis layer) and muscle tissue, in that order.<br><br>
There is considerable variation in the skin thickness both between individuals and within the same individual at different sites of the body. Generally, the outer skin layer, epidermis, has a thickness between 500-200 microns, and the dermis, the inner and thicker layer of the skin, has a thickness between 1.5-3.5 mm. Therefore, a needle cannula that penetrates the skin deeper than about 3,0 mm has a potential of passing through the dermis layer of the skin and making the injection into the subcutaneous region, which may result in an insufficient immune response, especially where the substance to be delivered intradermally has not been indicated for subcutaneous injection. Also, the needle cannula may penetrate the skin at too shallow a depth to deliver the substance and result in what is commonly known in the art as "wet injection" because of reflux of the substance from the injection site.<br>
[0004]	Due to the inherent limitations of the standard needle assembly, the<br>
standard procedure for making an intradermal injection is known to be difficult to perform, and therefore dependent upon experience and technique. This procedure is recommended to be performed by stretching the skin, orienting the needle bevel to face upwardly, and inserting a 26 Gauge short bevel needle cannula to deliver a volume of 0.5 ml or less of the substance into the skin of an animal with the needle cannula being inserted into the skin at an angle varying from around 10 - 15 degrees to form a blister or wheal in which the substance is deposited or otherwise contained. Accordingly, the technique utilized to perform the standard intradermal injection is difficult and requires the attention of a trained nurse or medical doctor. Inserting the needle to a depth greater than about 3.0 mm typically results in a failed intradermal injection because the substance being expelled through the cannula will be injected into the subcutaneous tissue of the animal.<br>
[0005]	The most frequent cause of a failed intradermal injection is derived from<br>
inserting the needle into the skin at an angle greater than 15 degrees relative to the flattened skin surface. A further cause of error is derived from pinching rather than stretching the skin in the area of the injection, which is normally done when giving a subcutaneous rather than an intradermal injection. Pinching increases the likelihood of giving a subcutaneous injection.   Procedural errors as described above result in<br><br>
delivering the contents of the injection into the subcutaneous layer, which can reduce<br>
the effectiveness of the injection, as well as possibly deliver the substance in a way not<br>
approved for delivery. Intradermal injections performed by using the standard<br>
procedure also are known to cause a significant amount of pain to the recipient of the<br>
injection because the needle cannula is inserted into the skin at an angle of about fifteen<br>
degrees. By inserting the needle cannula at this angle, about 5mm to about 6mm of the<br>
needle is actually inserted into the skin. This results in a significant disruption of the<br>
pain receptors dispersed throughout the upper layers of the skin. Also, self-<br>
administered intradermal injections are not possible using the present method.<br>
[0006]	Accordingly, there has been a long felt need for a needle assembly<br>
attachable to a prefillable container enabling a simplified method of performing an intradermal injection of substances which overcomes the problems and limitations associated with the use of conventional devices, especially reducing the probability of error and pain caused from the injection by making such injections less dependent upon experience and technique. In addition, there has been a need to reliably limit the depth of penetration of the needle cannula into the skin of the animal to avoid entry into the subcutaneous layer of the skin as well as reliably fix the orientation of the needle cannula relative to the skin. Also, there has been a need to apply pressure to the skin of the animal to facilitate formation of the blister or wheal in the skin in which the substance is deposited or otherwise contained and avoid wet injections. Further, pressure is applied to mask the pain derived from the intradermal injection by â¢ stimulating the muscle fibers to block the pain receptors. Still further, there has been a need to provide an needle assembly capable of addressing each of these shortcomings and yet be mated to the prefilled container just prior to administering the injection.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION AND ADVANTAGES<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
[0038]	Referring to Hgure 1A and IB, an intradermal needle assembly is<br>
generally shown at 10. The assembly includes a limiter portion 12 and a hub portion 14 disposed inside the limiter portion 12. A fcxwaid cap 16 is disposed upon the end of the hub portion 14, and a rearward cap 17 is removably affixed to the forward cap 16,<br><br>
the purpose of which will be explained further below. The hub portion 14 includes a<br>
throat 18 adapted to receive a prefillable container 20, as shown in Figure 2.<br>
[0039]	The prefillable container 20 includes a reservoir 21 adapted to store<br>
substances intended for intradermal delivery into the skin of an animal. The substances comprise drugs or vaccines known to be absorbed into or react with the immune response system of the body significantly better in the dermis layer of the skin of the animal as opposed to in the subcutaneous or intramuscular region of the animal. Specifically, hepatitis B vaccines, it has been determined, are significantly more imunogenic when injected into the dermis layer of the skin of an animal. The prefillable container 20 may be a container that is filled at a pharmaceutical manufacturer with a liquid substance and sealed with a tip cap (not shown) for later use with the assembly 10 of the present invention. The prefillable container 20 may further be filled with a powder substance to which liquid is added just prior to administering the intradermal injection. Still further, the prefillable container maybe filled with the entire substance just prior to administering the intradermal injection.<br>
[0040]	The prefillable container 20 can be any of a variety of designs such as,<br>
for example, a hypodermic syringe, cartridge, pen, and any other delivery device to which the assembly 10 may be attached that is designed to expel substances for injection into an animal. For example, the assembly 10 might include threads (not shown) for attachment to a pen. The prefillable container 20 represented in the figures is intended for demonstration purposes only and does not limit the scope of the subject needle assembly 10.<br>
[0041]	Referring to Figure 3, the limiter portion 12 defines a tubular chamber<br>
22 wherein the hub portion 14 is received. A plurality of snaps 24 are disposed on a wall 23 of the tubular chamber 22 and clasp a flange 26 circumscribing a rearward end 28 of the hub portion 14 thereby securing the hub portion 14 inside the tubular chamber 22. The tubular chamber 22 includes a ridge 30 that abuts a forward edge 32 of the hub portion 14. The forward edge 32 defines the periphery of hub 14. A sheath 34 is centrally disposed to the forward edge 32 upon the hub portion 14. A needle cannula 36 is received by the sheath 34 and defines an axis of the forward edge 32. The needle<br><br>
cannula 36 is fixedly attached to the sheath 34 of the hub portion 14. Preferably, an adhesive 38 fixedly attaches the needle cannula 36 to a sheath 34. More preferably, an cpoxy adhesive that is curable with ultraviolet light is used to fixedly attach the needle cannula 36 to the sheath 34. However, other methods of affixing the needle cannula 36 to die sheath 34 may be used such as an interference fit<br>
[0042]	The needle cannula 36 includes a rearward needle end 40 that extends<br>
through the sheath 34 into the throat 18 of the hub portion 14. When the prefillable container 20 is inserted into the throat 18 the rearward needle end 40 is in fluid communication with the prefillable container 20 thereby allowing the substance disposed within the prefillable container 20 to be expelled through the needle cannula 36. Preferablyf the prefillable container 20 will be inserted into the throat 18 just prior to administering die intradermal injection. The rearward needle end 40 may be extended and pointed (not shown) to be able to pierce the sealed prefillable container making the fluid connection. The throat 18 includes a tapered bottom /^ adapted to<br>
cue.<br>
retain the inserted prefillable container 20 through a Lfcpr Slip connection as is well<br>
known in the art of syringe retention. Alternatively, a LptfrLok connection (not shown)<br>
may be utilized to retain the prefillable container 20 within the throat 18.<br>
[0043]	The needle cannula 36 includes a forward tip 42 that is adapted to<br>
administer an intradermal injection. Preferably, the forward tip 42 includes a beveled edge 44 ranging in length from approximately 0.8 mm to 1.0 mm. More preferably, the beveled edge 44 includes a length of approximately 0.9 mm. A standard bevel tip length ranges from approximately 13 mm to 1.6 mm. The reduced length of the present beveled edge 44 reduces die potential of the needle cannula 36 passing through the dermis layer of die skin of die animal and resulting in die substance from the prefillable container 20 being injected into the subcutaneous region of the animal and conversely also reduces die potential for leakage.<br>
[00441	The linriter portion 12 surrounds the needle cannula 36 and extends away<br>
from the hub portion 14 toward theforward tip 42 of die needle cannula36. Thelimiter portion 12 includes an opening or aperture 48 which closely receives the needle cannula 36 and a generally flat sltin engaging surface 46 extending in a plane that is generally<br><br>
perpendicular to the axis of the needle cannula 36 within about fifteen degrees of perpendicular or more preferable within about five degrees. The skin engaging surface 46 is adapted to be received against the skin of the animal to administer an intradermal injection of the substance. The skin engaging surface 46 is represented as being generally flat and continuous and provides for a stable placement of the needle assembly 10 against the animal1 s skin. Referring to Figure 6^, the skin engaging surface may include an annular groove 47 with a central surface 49 circumscribing the needle cannula. Figure 6Rshows a skin engaging surface 46 having a plurality of spokes 51 projecting outwardly from the central surface 49 in a plane generally parallel to that of the central surface 49. The skin engaging surface 46 provides stability for the device during injection and preferably has a cross-section of at least 5 mm or between 5 to 20<br>
mm<br>
[0045]	The forward tip 42 of the needle cannula 36 extends beyond the skin<br>
engaging surface 46 a distance of approximately 0.S mm to 3.0 mm and preferably<br>
about 1.0 to 2.0 mm, and more preferably 1.5 mm Â± 0.2 to 03 mm. The length the<br>
needle can""*8 36 extends beyond die skin engaging surface 46 is determined by the<br>
position of the ridge 30 relative to the skin engaging surface46. Therefore, the limiter<br>
portion 12 limits penetration of die needle cannula 36 into the dermis layer of die akin<br>
of the animal so that the substance is injected into	When<br>
the hub portion 14 is inserted into the tubular chamber 22 of die limiter portion 12 during assembly, die needle cannula 36 is inserted through an aperture 48 disposed in die skin engaging surface 46 of the limiter portion 12. Thus, only die length of the needle cannula 36 extending through the aperture 48 is available to be inserted into die skin of the animal.<br>
[0046]	Refiaring to Figures 1A and IB, the forward cap 16 conceals the forward<br>
tip 42 of the needle cannula 36. The rearward cap 17 mates to the forward cap 16 and is removably secured with an interference fit provided by a plurality of annular ribs 43 disposed upon a surface of the rearward cap and abutting die forward cap 16. The forward cap 16 includes an annular protuberance 45 positioned opposite die annular ribs 43 providing a snapping action when the forward cap 16 and the rearward cap 17 are<br><br>
mated The caps 16,17 provide a sanitary enclosure for the assembly 10. To ensure the<br>
assembly 10 has not been accessed prior to administering the injection, a tamper<br>
indicator strip 47 is positioned over a seam formed between the caps 16,17. The strip<br>
47 is perforated along the seam. A ripped or torn perforation indicates that the assembly<br>
10 has been open and that the needle cannula 36 may no longer be sanitary.<br>
[0047]	An alternative embodiment of the limiter portion 112 is shown in<br>
Figure 4. The alternative limiter portion 112 includes an alternative skin engaging surface 146 having an elastomeric central area 148 functioning as a piercable septum surrounded by a nonelastomeric substrate comprising the remainder of the skin engaging surface 146 and the alternative limiter 112. When the hub portion 14 is inserted into a throat of the alternate limiter 112 the forward tip 42 of the needle cannula 36 pierces the elastomeric central area 148 of the skin engaging surface 146. The elastomeric central area 148 includes a larger diameter than the aperture 48 of the preferred embodiment. Therefore, it should be understood that the assembly process of mating the hub portion 14 with the alternate limiter 112 will be more easily performed because the needle cannula 36 will not have to be inserted through a narrow aperture 48. Further, while administering the intradermal injection, the elastomeric central area 148 provides uniform pressure on the skin of the animal facilitating the formation of a wheal in the skin.<br>
[0048]	A second alternative embodiment is generally shown in Figure 5 at 210.<br>
In this embodiment, the limiter portion 212 and the hub portion 214 are integrally formed as a single piece. The needle cannula 36 is fixedly attached to the hub portion 214 of the single component 210 behind a skin engaging surface 246 of the limiter portion 212. Preferably, the needle cannula 36 is inserted through an aperture 248 disposed in the skin engaging surface 246. The needle cannula 36 is fixedly attached to a sheath 234 disposed in the hub portion 214 behind the skin engaging surface 246. The needle cannula 36 is affixed through similar means as has been disclosed for the preferred embodiment. Additionally, the rearward end 28 of the needle cannula 36 is disposed in the throat 218 of the hub portion 214 and thereby establishes fluid<br><br>
communication with the prefillable container 20 in a similar fashion as has been disclosed for the preferred embodiment.<br>
[0049]	Referring to Figure 7, a third alternate assembly 310 adapted to shield<br>
the needle cannula 36 subsequent to administering an intradermal injection is shown. A sleeve 312 generally defining a tube slidably circumscribes the limiter 314, The sleeve 312 includes a skin engaging end 316 that is aligned in generally the same plane as the skin engaging surface 318 when the assembly 310 is prepared for administering the intradermal injection, A rearward end 320 of the sleeve 312 is tapered inwardly towards the axis of the needle cannula 36. The rearward end 320 abuts a rear flange 322 of the limiter 314, which prevents the sleeve 312 from being removed from the limiter 314 in the direction of the prefillable container 20. In this embodiment, an elastomeric tip cap 323 is removably secured to the skin engaging surface 318 and receives the forward tip 42 of the needle cannula 36.<br>
[0050]	Subsequent to administering the intradermal injection, the sleeve 312<br>
may be manually pulled in the direction of the forward tip 42 of the needle cannula 36 as shown in Figure 8. The limiter 314 includes a sleeve stop 324, which engages a corresponding contour 326 disposed on an inside surface of the sleeve 312 thereby preventing the sleeve from being removed from the limiter 314. At least one ramp 328 is disposed upon an outer surface of the limiter 314 over which the rearward end 320 of the sleeve 312 slides when die sleeve 312 is moved to cover the forward tip 42 of the needle cannula 36. The ramp 328 locks the sleeve in the extended position and prevents the sleeve 312 from being retracted toward the prefillable container 20 re-exposing the forward tip 42 once the rearward end 320 of the sleeve 312 has been moved past the ramp 328 in the direction of the forward tip 42.<br>
[0051]	Referring to Figure 9, a further alternate embodiment of the needle<br>
assembly is generally shown at 410. A needle plunger 412 is inserted through the limiter 414 at a generally perpendicular angle to the needle cannula 36. Depressing a pad 416 disposed on a distal end of the needle plunger 412 drives the needle plunger 412 inwardly of the limiter 414. As shown in Figure 10, needle plunger 412, when depressed, contacts and bends the needle cannula 36 retracting the needle cannula 36<br><br>
into the limiter 414 thereby shielding the forward tip 42 of the limiter 414 to prevent exposure thereto.<br>
[0052]	As will now be understood, the intradermal delivery device 10 of this<br>
invention includes a needle enclosure means, which encloses or conceals the needle<br>
cannula tip 42 following injection and which preferably cannot be retracted to prevent<br>
accidental needle contact or reuse. In one embodiment shown in Figures 7 and 8, the<br>
assembly includes an extendable shield 312, which locks in the extended position,<br>
preventing contact with the needle cannula 36. In another embodiment shown in<br>
Figures 9 and 10, the needle cannula 36 is bent or deformed beyond its elastic limit by<br>
needle plunger 412 to permanently enclose the forward tip 42 within the limiter 414.<br>
Alternatively, the needle assembly may be retractable as disclosed, for example, in a<br>
copending application Serial No.09/834669 . filed April13,2001 \ entitled<br>
Txefillable Intradermal Injector," die disclosure of which is incorporated by reference.<br>
[0053]	the invention has been described in an illustrative manner, and it is to<br>
be understood that die terminology which has been used is intended to be in the nature of words of description rather than of limitation.<br>
