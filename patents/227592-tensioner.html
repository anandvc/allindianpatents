				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
TENSIONER<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a tensioner that imparts a<br>
predetermined tensile force to a force transmitting member such<br>
as a chain or a timing belt that drives a camshaft of an engine<br>
mounted in a vehicle, such as a four wheel automobile or a two wheel<br>
vehicle, for example.<br>
Background Arts<br>
A tensioner is used in order to maintain a substantially fixed<br>
tensile force on a chain or a timing belt, even if slackness develops<br>
in the chain or the timing belt due to stretching or wear during<br>
use. As shown in Fig. 10, a conventional general tensioner is<br>
provided with a case 101, a rotary member 102 having a male screw<br>
portion 102a, a pressing member 103 having a female screw portion<br>
103a that screws together with the male screw portion 102a of the<br>
rotary member 102, a spring 104 that urges the rotary member 102<br>
in a first rotary direction, a bearing 109 in order to restrain<br>
rotation of the pressing member 103, and the like. When the rotary<br>
member 102 is rotated in the first direction by the spring 104,<br>
the pressing member 103 moves in an axis line direction. The rotary<br><br><br>
member 102 is stored in the case 101, and an end surface 102b of<br>
the rotary member 102 is rotatably supported by a bearing surface<br>
101b of the case 101.<br>
The tensioner urges the rotary member 102 in the first rotary<br>
direction by means of a repulsive force that accumulates when the<br>
spring 104 twists in a direction that is opposite to the first rotary<br>
direction. A rotary torque of the rotary member 102 moves the<br>
pressing member 103 in an axis line direction projecting from the<br>
case 101. A distal end of the pressing member 103 directly or<br>
indirectly pushes the force transmitting member such as the chain<br>
or the timing belt. Further, when the tensile force of the chain<br>
or the timing belt increases, a force pushing back the pressing<br>
member 103 increases. In this case, the pressing member 103 is pushed<br>
back in the axis line direction toward an inner portion of the case<br>
101, resisting a sum total of torques mainly including an urging<br>
force of the spring 104, a frictional resistance between the male<br>
screw portion 102a and the female screw portion 103a, and a frictional<br>
resistance between the end surface 102b of the rotary member 102<br>
and the bearing surface 101b of the case 101. The tensioner can<br>
impart a fixed tensile force to the chain or the timing belt based<br>
on those torques and the like.<br>
The frictional torque between the end surface 102b of the rotary<br>
member 102 and the bearing surface 101b of the case 101 largely<br>
fluctuates in the conventional tensioner, and large changes in<br><br><br>
performance arise. For example, the return characteristics of the<br>
pressing member 103 may become poor, and the initial characteristics<br>
may become unstable.<br>
In order to solve this type of problem, Japanese Patent No. I<br>
2998100 proposes a tensioner that stabilizes initial characteristics<br>
and reduces changes in characteristics during operation.<br>
Conventional tensioners having stabilized performance are<br>
also preferable, but large changes in the tensile force of the force<br>
transmitting member (chain or timing belt) may also occur in those<br>
tensioners, caused by wear that develops with use over time.<br>
In view of those points, an object of the present invention<br>
is to provide a tensioner in which a bearing is provided in an end<br>
portion contact surface of a bearing surface of a case that supports<br>
an end portion of a rotary member, or in a bearing surface of the<br>
case, and in which changes in performance are prevented by setting<br>
the initial surface precision of the end portion contact surface<br>
of the bearing to the same order as the surface roughness after<br>
use, and leveling the contact surface with high precision, the<br>
tensioner of a quality having performance that is further stabilized<br>
more than a conventional tensioner.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
According to the present invention, there is provided a<br>
tensioner which converts a rotary force of a rotary member into<br><br><br>
an impulsive force in an axis line direction of a pressing member,<br>
the tensioner including: a case; the rotary member rotatably received<br>
in the case in a state where a movement in the axis line direction<br>
is restrained; the pressing member which is threadedly engaged with<br>
the rotary member, which is movable in the axis line direction,<br>
whose rotation with respect to the case is restrained, and on which<br>
a load from a force transmitting member acts in the axis line<br>
direction; and a spring which is stored in an inner portion of the<br>
case, and which imparts the rotary force to the rotary member,<br>
characterized in that:<br>
an end portion of the rotary member is rotatably supported<br>
by a bearing surface of the case; the end portion of the rotary<br>
member receives the load that acts on the pressing member; and a<br>
precision of a contact surface of the bearing surface that contacts<br>
the end portion of the rotary member is set such that a surface<br>
roughness Rmax is equal to or less than 4.0 S and a levelness is<br>
equal to or less than 2 urn.<br>
A f rictional torque between the end portion of the rotary member<br>
and the bearing surface of the case thus decreases and becomes constant,<br>
the initial characteristics stabilize, changes in characteristics<br>
over time during use become smaller, and the performance<br>
characteristics are stabilized over a long period of time.<br>
Further, the tensioner of the present invention is a tensioner<br>
which converts a rotary force of a rotary member into an impulsive<br><br>
force in an axis line direction of a pressing member, the tensioner<br>
including: a case; the rotary member rotatably received in the case<br>
in a state where a movement in the axis line direction is restrained;<br>
the pressing member which is threadedly engaged with the rotary<br>
member, which is movable in the axis line direction, whose rotation<br>
with respect to the case is restrained, and on which a load from<br>
a force transmitting member acts in the axis line direction; and<br>
a spring which is stored in an inner portion of the case, and which<br>
imparts the rotary force to the rotary member,<br>
characterized in that an end portion of the rotary member is<br>
rotatably supported by a bearing provided in a bearing surface of<br>
the case, the end portion of the rotary member receives the load<br>
that acts on the pressing member, and a precision of a contact surface<br>
of the bearing surface that contacts the end portion of the rotary<br>
member is set such that a surface roughness Rmax is equal to or<br>
less than 4.0 S and a levelness is equal to or less than 2 urn.<br>
Actions and effects similar to the aspect of the present<br>
invention described above are also provided by the tensioner<br>
according to the present invention.<br>
In addition, the tensioner according to the present invention<br>
is characterized in that the bearing is a closed end cylindrical<br>
member, or a bearing in which a cylindrical member and a base plate<br>
are separate members and the precision of the contact surface of<br>
the bearing surface that contacts the end portion of the rotary<br><br><br>
member is set such that the surface roughness Rmax is equal to or<br>
less than 4.0 S and the levelness is equal to or less than 2 urn.<br>
Precise polishing thus becomes easy to implement, and the<br>
precision of the surface roughness and the levelness can be increased.<br>
Thus, in the tensioner according to the present invention,<br>
by setting the precision of the contact surface of the bearing surface<br>
supporting the rotary member, which contacts the rotary member end<br>
portion such that the surface roughness is equal to or less than<br>
4.0 S and the levelness is equal to or less than 2 urn, the initial<br>
surface precision is given to the same degree as the surface roughness<br>
resulting from wear over time with use, and changes in tensile force<br>
with use can be prevented. In addition, rotary sliding between the<br>
end surface of the rotary member and the bearing surface of the<br>
case, or the bearing, is made satisfactory. Therefore, there is<br>
little reduction in the tensile force over time with use, and<br>
characteristics can be kept stable over a long period of time.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
A detailed description of the present invention is made<br>
according to the appended drawings.<br>
Fig. 1 is a cross sectional view of a tensioner showing an<br>
embodiment mode of the present invention, and Fig. 2 is a cross<br>
sectional view of a portion of an engine showing a usage example<br>
of the tensioner.<br>
The tensioner is employed in a power transmission mechanism<br>
201 of an automobile engine 200 shown in Fig,. 2, for example. The<br>
power transmission mechanism 201 transmits rotary motion of the<br>
engine 200 to a cam shaft 203 through an endless force transmitting<br>
member 202, such as a timing belt or a chain. The tensioner is<br>
therefore mounted in a predetermined location of the engine 200,<br>
7<br><br>
and pushes the force transmitting member 202 in a direction shown<br>
by an arrow V by means of an impulsive force that is described later,<br>
thus maintaining a constant tensile force.<br>
The tensioner shown in Fig. 1 is provided with a case 1, a<br>
rotary member 2, and a cylindrical pressing member 3. The rotary<br>
member 2 is stored in an inner portion of the case 1. A back end<br>
portion of the pressing member 3 is inserted into the inner portion<br>
of the case 1, and a front end portion of the pressing member 3<br>
projects to a portion outside the case 1.<br>
A cavity portion 1a for inserting the rotary member 2 and the<br>
pressing member 3 is formed in the inner portion of the case 1.<br>
An open portion 1b is formed in the front end portion of the case<br>
1,	and the pressing member 3 moves into and out of the open portion<br>
1b along an axis line X of the pressing member 3. An open portion<br>
1c is also formed in the back end portion of the case 1. A stopper<br>
14 can be inserted into the open portion lc in order to lock rotation<br>
of the rotary member 2 when necessary. A slit 23 is formed in a<br>
back end portion of the rotary member 2. Inserting a tip of the<br>
stopper 14 into the slit 23 can lock rotation of the rotary member<br>
2.	The stopper 14 is removed from the slit 23 of the rotary member<br>
2 when using the tensioner.<br>
A male screw portion 21 is formed in a front side portion of<br>
the rotary member 2, and a female screw portion 13 is formed in<br>
a hollow inner circumference of the pressing member 3. By screwing<br><br><br>
the male screw portion 13 and the female screw portion 21 together,<br>
it becomes possible to attach the rotary member 2 and the pressing<br>
member 3 together so that the rotary member 2 and the pressing member<br>
3 can rotate relative to each other, and can advance in the axis<br>
line X direction while rotating.<br>
The rotary member 2 and the pressing member 3 in the attached<br>
state described above are then inserted into a spring 5. The spring<br>
5 extends in a direction along the axis line X of the rotary member<br>
2 and the pressing member 3, and one end portion 5a of the spring<br>
5 is inserted into the slit 23 of the rotary member 2. The slit<br>
23 is directed along the axis line X of the rotary member 2. Another<br>
end portion 5b of the spring 5 is latched to the case 1, or is latched<br>
to a bearing 6 that is attached to the case 1. Both end portions<br>
5a and 5b of the spring 5 are thus latched to the rotary member<br>
2 and the case 1, respectively. When a tip of a jig used for rotation<br>
(a screwdriver, for example) is inserted into the slit 23, and the<br>
rotary member 2 is made to rotate about the axis line X, energy<br>
(torque) of the rotary member 2, which rotates the rotary member<br>
2 in an opposite direction, accumulates due to the spring 5 twisting.<br>
The bearing 6 is provided in the front end portion of the case<br>
1. A fixing member such as a ring spring 7, for example, fixes the<br>
bearing 6 to the case 1. A non-circular sliding hole 6a is formed<br>
in the bearing 6, and the pressing member 3 passes through the sliding<br>
hole 6a. An outer circumferential surface of the pressing member<br><br><br>
3 is formed in a non-circular shape that corresponds to the sliding<br>
hole 6a of the bearing 6. Mating the pressing member 3 with the<br>
sliding hole 6a of the bearing 6 restricts rotation of the pressing<br>
member 3 relative to the case 1. A cap 8 is attached to the front<br>
end of the pressing member 3. The cap 8 contacts the timing belt<br>
or the chain used as the force transmitting member 202 directly,<br>
or indirectly through a relay member.<br>
When the rotary member 2 is made to rotate in a second direction<br>
and the spring 5 is twisted, elastic energy in the spring 5 causes<br>
the rotary member 2 to rotate in the first direction. This rotation<br>
is transmitted to the pressing member 3 through the screw portions<br>
13 and 21, and the bearing 6 restricts the rotation of the pressing<br>
member 3. A rotary force of the rotary member 2 is thus converted<br>
into an impulsive force in the axis line X direction of the pressing<br>
member 3. The pressing member 3 thus advances in a direction<br>
projecting from the case 1.<br>
On the other hand, a load Z applied from the force transmitting<br>
member 2 such as a timing belt or a chain acts on the pressing member<br>
3, and pushes the pressing member 3 in the axis line X direction.<br>
This pushing force is transmitted to the rotary member 2 through<br>
the screw portions 13 and 21, and the rotary member 2 thus resists<br>
an urging force of the spring 5 and rotates in the second direction.<br>
By the rotary member 2 rotating in this direction, the pressing<br>
member 3 is pushed back within the case 1. The tensile force of<br><br><br>
the force transmitting member can be kept nearly constant by this<br>
motion.<br>
A large diameter portion 28 having a diameter larger than that<br>
of the screw portion 21 is provided in the back end portion of the<br>
rotary member 2. A bearing surface 19 of the case 1 that is formed<br>
in the perimeter of the open portion 1c faces an end surface 22<br>
of the large diameter portion 28. A bearing 9 is disposed between<br>
the bearing surface 19 and the end surface 22 of the rotary member<br>
2. A closed end cylinder 9b, like that shown in Fig. 3, is used<br>
in this embodiment for the bearing 9. The end surface 22 of the<br>
rotary member 2 contacts a base surface of the cylinder 9b, that<br>
is, a contact surface 9a of the end surface 22 of the rotary member<br>
2 . The load Z that acts on the pressing member 3 supports the bearing<br>
surface 19 of the case 1 through the end surface 22 of the rotary<br>
member 2 and the closed end cylinder 9b.<br>
The base surface of the cylinder 9b, that is, the contact surface<br>
9a of the end surface 22 of the rotary member 2, is polished precisely<br>
so that the surface roughness Rmax is equal to or less than 4.0<br>
S, preferably equal to or less than 2.0 S, and the levelness is<br>
equal to or less than 2 Âµm. This precise polishing may also be<br>
performed on an inner circumferential surface of a cylinder portion<br>
of the cylinder 9b.<br>
Further, as shown in Fig. 4, the bearing 9 may also be a bearing<br>
having a cylinder member 9c that is separate from a base plate 9d.<br><br>
In this case, the precise polishing is performed at least on the<br>
contact surface 9a of the base plate 9d.<br>
The bearing 9 is provided in the bearing surface 22 of the<br>
case 1 that supports the end surface 22 of the rotary member 2 in<br>
this embodiment mode. The contact surface 9a of the bearing 9 that<br>
contacts the end surface 22 of the rotary member 2 is given such<br>
that a surface roughness Rmax is equal to or less than 4 .0S, preferably<br>
equal to or less than 2.0 S, and a levelness is equal to or less<br>
than 2 urn. The end surface 22 of the rotary member 2 therefore slides<br>
smoothly when the rotary member 2 is rotated with respect to the<br>
bearing 9 of the case 1 about its axis line. There are no changes<br>
in frictional torque, and therefore the characteristics are<br>
stabilized. That is, satisfactory return characteristics can be<br>
achieved. Accordingly, rotary sliding of the end surface 22 of the<br>
rotary member 2 with respect to the bearing 9 becomes even smoother<br>
when precise polishing is also performed on the inner circumferential<br>
surfaces of the cylinders 9b and 9c. It is therefore preferable<br>
to perform precise polishing on the inner circumferential surfaces<br>
of the cylinders 9b and 9c.<br>
Note that, the precision of a conventional contact surface<br>
has a surface roughness Rmax equal to or less than 8.0 s, and a<br>
levelness equal to or less than 15 Âµm. Fig. 5 is a cross sectional<br>
view showing a conventional surface shape. The precision of the<br>
contact surface 9a of the present invention has a surface roughness<br><br><br>
Rmax equal to or less than 4.0 S, and a levelness equal to or less<br>
than 2 Âµm. Fig. 6 is a cross sectional view showing a surface state<br>
of the contact surface 9a.<br>
Fig. 7 is a graph showing experimental results for a<br>
relationship between elapsed time of use and tensile force.<br>
According to Fig. 7, it can be understood that although the tensioner<br>
of the present invention has a tensile force that is maintained<br>
nearly constant over time during use and the characteristics thereof<br>
are stable, the conventional tensioner has large changes and unstable<br>
characteristics.<br>
Further, Fig. 8 is a graph showing experimental results for<br>
a relationship between surface roughness and force transmitting<br>
member (chain) tensile force, and Fig. 9 is a graph showing<br>
experimental results for a relationship between levelness and force<br>
transmitting member (chain) tensile force.<br>
According to Fig. 8 and Fig. 9 , it can be understood that there<br>
is a tendency for the force transmitting member (chain) tensile<br>
force to decrease as the surface roughness and the levelness decrease.<br>
It can be understood that the force transmitting member (chain)<br>
tensile force is stable and satisfactory when the surface roughens<br>
Rmax is equal to or less than 4.0 S and the levelness is equal to<br>
or less than 2 Âµm, and that a large effect is provided in the precision<br>
of the present invention.<br>
Furthermore, the tensile force further stabilizes when the<br><br><br>
surface roughness Rmax is equal to or less than 2.0 S, which is<br>
preferable.<br>
It should be noted that the embodiment mode described above<br>
does not limit the present invention. Various changes are permitted<br>
to the present invention in a scope that does not deviate from the<br>
gist of the invention. For example, a processing method for ensuring<br>
surface precision is not limited to precise polishing. Chemical<br>
polishing, forging, precision pressing, and the like may also be<br>
used. Furthermore, the precision of the bearing surface 22 of the<br>
case 1 may also be given such that a surface roughness Rmax is equal<br>
to or less than 4.0 S and a levelness is equal to or less than 2<br>
Âµm, without providing the bearing 9 in the bearing surface 22 of<br>
the case 1 that supports the end surface of the rotary member 2.<br>
Actions and effects that are similar to those of the embodiment<br>
mode described above can also be provided in this case as well.<br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
As described above, the tensioner according to the present<br>
invention is used in order to maintain a nearly constant tensile<br>
force, even if slackness develops in the chain or the timing belt<br>
due to stretching or wear during use. The tensioner is therefore<br>
effective when used with a chain, a timing belt, or the like that<br>
drives a camshaft of an engine mounted in a vehicle such as a four<br>
wheel automobile or a two wheel vehicle, for example.<br><br>
We claim :<br>
1.	A tensioner that converts a rotary force of a rotary member<br>
(2) into an impulsive force in an axis line direction of a<br>
pressing member (3), the tensioner comprising:<br>
