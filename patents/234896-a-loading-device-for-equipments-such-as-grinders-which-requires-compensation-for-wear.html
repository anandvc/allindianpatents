This invention relates to a loading device for equipments such as grinders. This device is intended to lock the top arm and to couple the roller shaft of the grinder. It also creates or release load for grinding and avoids multiple operations.<br>
Dry and wet grinders available in the market at present have various types of locking and loading means. In one of the popular types of wet grinders, a spring loaded mechanism locks the roller shaft on which roller stones are attached. After locking the components in place, the system is con^ressed to exert load on the rollers.<br>
In yet another model, the roller shaft with the rollers attached thereto is fixed to the central shaft by means of a lock nut<br>
In both these cases, the extent of compression of the spring decides the amount of load. The compression rate also depends on the height of the roller shaft on which roller stones are assembled. It has been observed that due to prolonged use, the stone surfaces wear out results in low compression of the spring hence less load for grinding. Due to this efficacy of the grinder is considerably reduced.<br>
One of the objects of this invention is to overcome this problem and to maintain a uniform load on tlie grinding area even after accounting for normal wear of the grinding surfaces.<br><br>
Yet another object of this invention is to combine both locking of the top ann and creation of load for grinding by a single operation. Locking of the arm against spring load is also avoided.<br>
The loading device may be fixed on the existing grinders thereby ov^coming the problems or draw backs foimd therein. Alternately, the device may also be assembled in new ^nders.<br>
The loading device according to this invention consists of a top nut and a bottom nut, which buts against the bottom face of the top nut. The bottom nut is provided within a sleeve member and is mounted on this permitting up and down movement within the sleeve member. A compression spring is sandwiched between the top and bottom nuts. A long pitch threaded pin operably connected to a knob member, extends through the bottom nut. This assembly is provided with a housing such that rotation of the sleeve member is avoided while permitting up and down movement of the same within the housing. The top dead center of this device is fixed while the bottom dead center is flexible to accommodate the variations in the roller shaft due to wear of roller stones. The knob member is associated with a cam. When fixed to the arm of a grinder, this cam activates a slider mechanism provided therein to effect automatic locking of the top ann with the motor housing.<br><br>
Tiie loading device for grinders comprises a housing provided with a movable sleeve member at its base, a compression spring sandwiched between a top nut and a bottom nut housed thereia the top face of said bottom nut abutting with the bottom face of said top nut at least a portion of said bottom nut being movabiy disposed within said sleeve member, a knob member with a long pitch threaded pin extending downwardly therefrom and operably connected thereto, and a cam associated with said knob member, such that, initial rotation of said knob member couples and holds the roller shaft of a grinder and further rotation of said knob member compresses said spring to exert load on said roller shaft of said grinder.<br>
Tliis invention will now be described with reference to the single figures 1 and 2 of the accompanying drawings.<br>
Figure I is a sectionaJ view of tlie loading device according to the invention.<br>
Figure 2 is a bottom view of the loading device shown in figure 1.<br>
Reference numeral 1 shows the knob member and reference numeral 2 represents the long pitch threaded pin associated therewith. The housing is shown by reference nunural 3 and the sleeve by reference numeral 4. The top and the bottom nuts are shown by reference numerals 5 and 6 respectively while the spring is shown by reference numeral 7. Reference numeral 8 represents the cam associated with the knob member and reference numeral 9 indicates the pin provided in the sleeve member. The bottom nut is movable upward and downward without the sleeve member within this pin.<br><br>
The roller shaft of a grinder is held in position when the device is mounted tlierein and rotated. Further rotation of the knob member compresses the spring to exert pressure on the roller shaft. Variation in the height of the roller shaft due to wear of the stone surfaces may be compensated by adequately moving down the top and the bottom nuts. On compression, the spring member moves down till the sleeve rests on the roller shaft. Further rotation of the knob releases the bottom nut from the sleeve. The spring member gets detached from the sleeve and exerts pressure on the roller shaft. In this position, the bottom nut rests on the sleeve member to arrest its up and down movement during grinding operation. The downward movement of the spring member is therefore fle.xible and hence the load exerted on the shaft will be uniform througliout the life of die grinder irrespective of wear of tlie roller stones.<br>
When the knob is rotated in the opposite direction, the top and tlie bottom nuts move up along wltli the sleeve to release tlie spring load. Further rotation of the knob unlocks the device from the grinder. Subsequent operations are known in the art and hence not described herein.<br>
The loading device described herein may be used on any equipment which requires compensation for variation in height or length to maintain uniform load always.<br>
.-Mterations and modifications known to persons skilled in the art are within the scope and ambit of the appended claims.<br><br><br>
WE CLAIM;<br>
1.	A loading device for equipments such as grinders comprising a housing<br>
provided wilt a movable sleeve member at its base, a compression spring<br>

said bottom nut abutting with the bottom face of said top nut, at least a portion<br>
of said bottom nut being movably disposed witling said sleeve member  a knob<br>
member with a long pitch threaded pin extending downwardly therefrom and<br>
operably connected thereto, and a cam associated with said knob member, such<br>
that initial rotation of said knob member locks tile arm on motor housing and<br>
further rotation of said knob member  the spring to exert load on<br>
roller shaft of a grinder.<br>
2.	The loading device as claimed in claim 1 wherein the bottom nut is held within<br>
the sleeve member with pins which allow upward and downward movement of<br>
said nut within the sleeve member.<br>
3.	The loading device as claimed in claims 1 w 2 \^ierein, the top dead center of<br>
, r<br>
the spring member is fixed and its bottom dead cenC^ flexible.<br>
4.	A loading device for grinders substantial!}' as herein described with particular<br>
refeience to the figure in the accompanying drawings.<br><br></td>
