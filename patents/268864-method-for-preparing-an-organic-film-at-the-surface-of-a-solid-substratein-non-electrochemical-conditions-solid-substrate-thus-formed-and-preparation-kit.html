THE	FOLLOWING	SPECIFICATION<br>
PARTICULARLY DESCRIBES THE INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFORMED.<br><br><br><br><br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
This invention relates to the field of organic surface coatings, said coatings being in the form of organic films. It relates more specifically to the use of solutions appropriately selected to allow the simple and reproducible formation of organic films by coating on electrically- or non-electrically-conductive surfaces without using the conventional surface functionalisation techniques. This invention also relates to a method for preparing such organic coatings.<br>
Prior art<br>
There are currently a number of techniques making it possible to produce organic thin films on substrates, each based on a suitable family or class of molecules.<br>
The spin coating method does not require any particular affinity between the molecules deposited and the substrate of interest, which is also true of related techniques for forming coatings by dip coating or by spray coating. Indeed, the cohesion of the deposited film is essentially based on the interactions between the constituents of the film, which can, for example, be cross-linked after deposition so as to improve its stability. These techniques are very versatile, applicable to any type of surface to be covered, and very reproducible. However, they do not allow any effective grafting between the film and the substrate {it involves simple physisorption) ,  and the thickness produced are<br>
2<br>
11 JUN 2009<br><br>
difficult to estimate in particular for thinnest deposits (less than 20 nanometers) . Moreover, the spin coating techniques allow for uniform deposits only when the surface to be coated is essentially planar (patent US 7,119,030) . The quality of the films obtained by spray coating techniques is related to the wetting of the surfaces by the sprayed liquid, since the deposit essentially becomes film-forming only when the drops coalesce. Thus, for a given polymer, there are generally only one or two organic solvents capable of giving satisfactory results in terms of thickness and deposit homogeneity.<br>
Other techniques for farminq an organic coating at the surface of a support, such as plasma deposition, described for example in the articles of Konuma M., "Film deposition by plasma techniques", (1992) Springer Verlag, Berlin, and Biederman H. and Osada Y. , "Plasma polymerization processes", 1992, Elsevier, Amsterdam or the photochemical initiation are based on the same principle: generating, near the surface to be covered, unstable forms of a prec ursor, which evolve by forming a film on the substrate. While the plasma deposition requires no particular properties of its precursors, the photo-initiation necessitates the uSe of photosensitive precursors, the structure of which evolves under light irradiation. These techniques generally give way to the formation of adherent films, although it is usually impossible to discern whether this adhesion is due to a cross-linking of a film topologically closed around the object or to a real formation of borids at the interface. Unfortunately, these methods require relatively complex and costly pre-treatments, the use of vacuum set-ups for<br>
3<br>
1 1 JUN 2009<br><br>
the plasma methods such as plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition, irradiation, or the use of potentiostats for the electrochemical methods to which many connection problems are related.<br>
Cataphoresis is a technique that is also suited for the coating of conductive surfaces with organic films. Cataphoresis or cationic electrodeposition makes it possible to coat metal parts using charged polymers and enables uniform films to be provided on conductive surfaces. This method does not apply to non-conductive parts and can be performed only using charged polymers that have already been pre-synthesized. Therefore, there is no growth of films during the use of the cataphoresis, but only deposition on the surface. In addition, the treatment requires the parts to be in direct contact with the cathode, as well as very strict monitoring the set of parameters of the cathodic bath, which must be complied with. The electrodeposited layer is insoluble, but lacks physical or chemical resistance, and therefore requires an additional baking step in order to acquire all of these properties. Moreover, this technique is unsuitable for small parts with a complex shape.<br>
The self-assembly of monolayers is a very simple technique to implement (Ulman A., "An introduction to ultrathin organic films from Langmuir-Blodgett films to self-assembly", 1991, Boston, Academic Press). However, this technique requires the use of generally molecular precursors having an adequate affinity for the surface of interest to be coated. Then, there is the precursor-surface pair, such as sulfur compounds having an affinity for gold or silver, tri-halogenosilanes for oxides such as silica or alumina, and polyaromatics for graphite or<br>
4<br>
11 JUN2009<br><br>
carbon nanotubes. In each case, the formation of the film<br>
is  based on a  specific  chemical  reaction between a<br>
portion of the molecular precursor (the sulfur atom in<br>
the case of thiols,  for example)  and some "receptor"<br>
sites on the surface. A   chemisorption reaction ensures<br>
the adhesion. Thus, at room temperature and in solution,<br>
films  of molecular  thickness  (less  than  10  nm)  are<br>
obtained.  However,  while  the  pairs  involving  oxide<br>
surfaces give way to the formation of very solidly<br>
grafted  films   (the  Si-0  bond  involved  in  the<br>
chemisorption of tri-halogenosilanes on silica is among<br>
the most stable in chemistry) , this is not at all the<br>
case when considering metals or semiconductors without<br>
oxide. In these cases, the interface bond between the<br>
conductive surface and the monomolecular film is fragile.<br>
Thus,  the self-assembled monolayers of thiols on gold<br>
desorb when they are heated to above 60 °C, or in the<br>
presence of a suitable solvent at room temperature, or<br>
when they are placed in contact with an oxidizing or<br>
reducing liquid medium. Similarly, the Si-O-Si bonds are<br>
fragilized when they are in an aqueous or even a moist<br>
medium, in particular under the effect of heat.<br>
The electrografting of polymers is a technique based on the initiation, then electrically induced polymerization, by chain propagation, of electroactive monomers on the surface of interest acting both as electrode and polymerization primer (Palacin, S., et al., "Molecule-to-metal bonds: Electrografting polymers on conducting surfaces.", Chemphyschem, 2004. (5)10: p. 1469-1481) . The electrografting requires the use of precursors suitable for its mechanism of initiation by reduction  and  propagation,  generally  anionic  because<br>
5<br>
11 JUN 2009<br><br>
cathodically-initiated electrografting is often preferred, applicable on noble and non-noble metals (unlike the electrografting by anodic polarization, which is applicable only on noble or carbon substrates: graphite, vitreous carbon, boron-doped diamond). The "depleted vinyl" molecules, i.e. bearing electroattractive functional groupings, such as acrylonitriles, acrylates and vinyl-pyridines, are particularly suitable for this method, which allows for numerous applications in the microelectronics or biomedical field. The adherence of these electrografted films is ensured by a carbon-metal covalent bond (G. Deniau et al., "Carbon-to-metal bonds: electroreduction of 2-butenenitrile" Surf. Sci. 2006, 600, 675) .<br>
According to this electrografting technique, polymerization is indispensable to the formation of the carbon/metal interface bond: it was indeed shown {G. Deniau et al., "Coupled chemistry revisited in the tentative cathodic electropolymerization of 2-butenenitrile.", Journal of Electroanalytical Chemistry, 1998, 451, 145-161) that the electrografting mechanism involves an electro-reduction of the monomer in the immediate vicinity of the surface, to yield to an unstable anion radical capable of being covalently grafted by its radical termination on the electrode. The grafted anion thus obtained, if it was not in the immediate vicinity of the polymerizable molecules, would desorb and return to the solution (op. cit.). In competition with this desorption reaction, the addition reaction (Michael addition) of the charge of the first anion chemisorbed on a free monomer provides a second means  of  stabilizing  the  reaction  intermediary:  the<br>
6<br>
11 JUN 2009<br><br>
product of this addition again yields a grafted anion, where the charge is, however, "away" from the surface, which contributes to the stabilization of the adsorbed structure. This dimer anion can itself again be added to a free monomer, and so on, each n^w addition providing additional stability by relaxing the polarized surface/charge repulsion, which means that the bonding interface of the first anion radical, which is temporary, becomes stable to the extent that polymerization occurs.<br>
Among the various techniques mentioned above, electrografting is the only technique that makes it possible to produce grafted films with a specific control of the bonding interface. Indeed, the only technique making it possible to graft polymer films resulting from vinyl monomers activated on surfaces, which are necessarily conductive, consistS of electrically initiating the polymerization reaction from the surface via a potentiostat, followed by a growth of chains, monomer-by-monomer, requiring the use of an electrochemical cell with a cathode and an anode, as well as an application of a voltage at the terminals thereof.<br>
Ortiz et al. (Electrochemical modification of a carbon electrode using aromatic diazonium salts. 2. Electrochemistry of 4-nitrophenyl modified glassy carbon electrodes in aqueous media. Journal of Electroanalytical Chemistry, 1998. 455(1-2)) described the grafting of diazonium salts synthesized in situ in the aqueous acid phase by electrochemical initiation. The international patent application WO 03 018212 describes, in particular, a method for grafting and growing an organic conductive film on an electrically conductive surface, the grafting and  the  growth  being  performed  simultaneously  by<br>
7<br>
11 JUN 2009<br><br>
electroreduction of a diazonium salt that is a precursor of said organic film.<br>
However, no technical solution has been proposed for producing organic coatings grafted on any type of surface, in  non-electrochemical  conditions  and  without  any particular pre-treatment technique.<br>
Description of the invention<br>
This invention makes it possible to solve the disadvantages of the prior art methods and coatings, and differs from the latter in that it makes it possible to perform the grafting of organic polymer or copolymer films in the absence of an electric voltage. The method proposed thus makes it possible to graft films onto surfaces of various types, and its application is not limited to electrically conductive or semiconductive surfaces.<br>
This invention relates to a method for preparing an organic  film  at  the  surface  of  a  solid  support, characterized in that it includes a step of contacting said surface with a liquid solution comprising: at least one solvent, at least one adhesion primer,<br>
under non-electrochemical conditions, and enabling the formation of radical entities based on the adhesion primer.<br>
In the sense of this invention, by "organic film", we mean any film of an organic nature, resulting from a plurality of units of organic chemical species, covalently bound to the surface of the support on which the method of the invention is carried out. It particularly  concerns  films  covalently  bound  to  the<br>
8<br>
11 JUN 2009<br><br>
surface of a support and including at least one layer of structural units of similar types, according to the thickness of the film, with its cohesion being ensured by the covalent bonds that develop between the different units.<br>
The solvent implemented in the method, also designed as "reaction solvent" may either be protic or aprotic. Advantageously, the primer implemented is soluble in the reaction solvent.<br>
By "protic solvent", we mean, in the context of this invention, a solvent that comprise at least one hydrogen atom capable of being released in proton form.<br>
The protic solvent is advantageously chosen from the group constituted by water, deionized water, distilled water, acidified or not, acetic acid, hydroxylated solvents such as methanol and ethanol, low-molecular-weight liquid glycols such as ethyleneglycol, and their mixtures. In a first alternative, the protic solvent used in the context of this invention is constituted only by a protic solvent or by a mixture of various protic solvents. In another alternative, the protic solvent or the mixture of protic solvents can be used in a mixture with at least one aprotic solvent, provided that the resulting mixture has the characteristics of a protic solvent. Acidified water is the preferred protic solvent and, more specifically, distilled or deionized acidified water.<br>
By "aprotic solvent", we mean, in the context of this invention, a solvent that is not protic. Such a solvent is not able to release or accept one hydrogen in the form of a proton under non-extreme conditions. The aprotic solvent is advantageously chosen from the group<br>

11 JUN 2009<br><br>
constituted  by  dimethylformamide  (DMF),  acetone  and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO).<br>
The term "adhesion primer", in the context of this invention, refers to any organic molecule capable, under certain conditions, of being chemisorbed at the surface of a solid support by a radical reaction such as radical chemical grafting. Such molecules comprise at least one functional group capable of reacting with a radical and also a reactive function with respect to another radical after chemisorption. These molecules are thus capable of forming a polymer-type film after the grafting of a first molecule to the surface of a support, then a reaction * with other molecules present in its environment.<br>
The term "radical chemical grafting" refers in particular to the use of molecular entities having a non-paired electron for forming covalent bonds with a surface of interest, said molecular entities being generated independently of the surface on which they are intended to be grafted. Thus, the radical reaction leads to the formation of covalent bonds between the surface concerned and the derivative of the grafted adhesion primer, then between a grafted derivative and molecules present in its environment.<br>
By "derivative of the adhesion primer", we mean, in the context of this invention, a chemical unit resulting from the adhesion primer, after the latter has reacted by radical chemical grafting, in particular with the surface of the solid support, or with another radical, implemented in the context of this invention. It is clear for a person skilled in the art that the reactive function  with  respect   to  another  radical   after<br>
10<br>
l 1 JUN2009<br><br>
chemisorption of the derivative of the adhesion primer is different from the function involved in the covalent bond in particular with the surface of the solid support.<br>
The adhesion primer is advantageously a cleavable aryl salt chosen from the group constituted by aryl diazonium salts, aryl ammonium salts, aryl phosphonium salts and aryl sulfonium salts. In these salts, the aryl group is an aryl group that can be represented by R as defined below.<br>
Among the cleavable aryl salts, the compounds of the following formula (I) can be cited in particular:<br>
R-N2+, A"	(I)<br>
in which:<br>
-	A represents a monovalent anion and,<br>
-	R represents an aryl group.<br>
As the aryl group of the cleavable aryl salts, and in particular of the above-mentioned compounds of formula (I), we can advantageously cite aromatic or heteroaromatic carbon structures, possibly mono- or polysubstituted, constituted by one or more aromatic or heteroaromatic cycles each comprising 3 to 8 atoms, the heteroatom(s) being N, 0, P or S. Tlie substituent (s) can contain one or more heteroatoms, suc:n asN 0 F Cl P Si, Br or S as well as alkyl groups in Ci to C6, in particular.<br>
Within the cleavable aryl saltS/ and in particular the above-mentioned compounds of formula (I), R is preferably chosen from the aryl groups substituted by electron-attracting groups such as NQ2, COH, ketones, CN, C02H, NH2, esters and halogens. The aryl-type R groups especially preferred are the nitrophenyl and phenyl radicals.<br>
11<br>
11 JUN 2009<br><br>
Within the above-mentioned compounds of formula (I), A can in particular be chosen from inorganic anions such as halides, for example I", Br" and CI", halogen borates such as tetrafluorohorate and organic anions such as alcoholates, carboxylates, perchlorates and sulfonates.<br>
As compounds of formula (I), it is particularly<br>
advantageous to use a compound chosen from the group<br>
constituted by phenyldiazonium tetrafluoroborate, 4-<br>
nitrophenyldiazonium tetrafluoroborate, 4-<br>
bromophenyldiazonium tetrafluoroborate, 4-<br>
aminophenyldiazonium chloride, 2-methyl-4-<br>
chlorophenyldiazonium chloride, 4-benzoylbenzenediazonium<br>
tetrafluoroborate,	4-cyanophenyldiazonium<br>
tetrafluoroborate,	4-carboxyphenyldiazonium<br>
tetrafluoroborate,	4-acetamidophenyldiazoniurn<br>
tetrafluoroborate, 4-phenylacetic acid diazonium<br>
tetrafluoroborate,	2-methyl-4-[(2-<br>
methylphenyl)diazenyl]benzenediazonium sulfate, 9,10-dioxo-9,10-dihydro-l-anthracenediazonium chloride, 4-nitronaphthalenediazonium tetrafluoroborate and naphthalenediazonium tetrafluoroborate.<br>
It is preferable for the adhesion primer to be soluble in the solvent used. In the sense of the invention, an adhesion primer is considered to be soluble in a given solvent if it remains soluble until reaching a concentration of 0.5 M, i.e. the solubility is at least equal to 0.5 M under normal conditions of temperature and pressure (NTP). Solubility is defined as the analytical composition of a saturated solution, expressed in terms of the proportion of a given solute in a given solvent; it can be expressed in particular in molarity. A solvent containing a given concentration of a compound will be<br>
12<br>
11 JUN2009<br><br>
considered to be saturated, when the concentration is equal to the solubility of the compound in this solvent. The solubility can be finite or infinite. In the latter case, the compound is soluble in any proportion in the considered solvent.<br>
The  amount  of  adhesion  primer  present  in  the<br>
solution used, according to the method of the invention,<br>
can vary as desired by the experimenter. This amount is<br>
related in particular to the desired thickness of the<br>
organic film as well as the amount of adhesion primer<br>
that can possibly and reasonably be integrated in the<br>
film.  Thus,  to obtain a  film grafted on the entire<br>
surface of the solid support in contact with the solution,<br>
it is necessary to use a minimum amount of adhesion<br>
primer,  which  can  be  estimated  by  molecular  size<br>
calculations. According to a particularly advantageous<br>
embodiment  of  the  invention,   the  adhesion  primer<br>
concentration in the liquid solution is between around<br>
10"6 and 5 M, and preferably between 5.10"2 and 10"1 M. A<br>
so-called "primer" layer is formed when the surface is<br>
coated with at least one film of monomolecular thickness<br>
derived  from  the  adhesion  primer  and  in  particular<br>
derived from diazonium.  The organic film can thus be<br>
constituted solely by a primer layer. It is of course<br>
possible  to use  any means  of analysis  to  test  the<br>
presence of the primer layer and determine its thickness;<br>
such means can in particular be infrared spectrometry (IR)<br>
measurements or X photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)  and<br>
ultraviolet (UV) measurements depending on the atoms and<br>
chemical groups present on the adhesion primer used.<br>
When  the  solvent  is  a  protic  solvent,   and advantageously,  if  the  adhesion  primer  is  an  aryl<br>
13<br>
11JUN2009<br><br>
diazonium salt, the pH of the solution is less than 7, typically less than or equal to 3. It is recommended to work with a pH between 0 and 3. If necessary, the pH of the solution can be adjusted to the desired value using one or more acidifying agents well known to a person skilled in the art, for example using organic or mineral acids such as hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, and so on. The adhesion primer can either be introduced in the liquid solution as defined above, or be prepared in   situ in the latter.  Thus,  in a particular embodiment,  the method according to this invention comprises a step of preparing the adhesion primer, in particular when it is an aryl diazonium salt.  Such compounds are generally prepared from arylamines, which may comprise a plurality of amine substituents,  by reaction with NaN02  in an acidic  medium.  For  a  detailed  description  of  the experimental modes   that   can   be   used   for   such   an   in   situ preparation, a person skilled in the art can refer to the open literature [D. Belanger et al. Chem. Mater. 18 (2006) 4755-4763] .  The  grafting  will  then  preferably  be performed directly in the solution for preparation of the aryl diazonium salt.<br>
By "non-electrochemical conditions", we mean, in the context of this invention, in the absence of electric voltage. Thus, the non-electrochemical conditions are conditions which allow the formation of radical entities from the adhesion primer, in the absence of the application of any voltage to the surface of the solid support or in the liquid solution. These conditions involve parameters such as, for example, temperature, nature of solvent, presence of a particular additive in the solution, agitation, while the electric current does<br>
14<br>
11 JUN 2009<br><br>
not intervene during the formation of radical entities. The non-electrochemical conditions allowing for the formation of radical entities are numerous, and this type of reaction is known and studied in detail in the prior art (Rempp &amp; Merrill, Polymer Synthesis, 1991, 65-86, Huthig &amp; Wepf).<br>
It is thus possible, for example, to adjust the thermal, kinetic, chemical, photochemical or radiochemical environment of the adhesion primer so as to destabilize it so that it will form a radical entity. It is of course possible to simultaneously adjust a plurality of these parameters.<br>
The thermal environment is based on the temperature of the solution. It is easy to control using heating methods normally used by a person skilled in the art. The use of a thermostatically controlled environment is of particular interest when it allows for precise control of the reaction conditions.<br>
The kinetic environment corresponds essentially to the agitation within the solution. In this case, it is not the agitation of molecules in itself (elongation of bonds, etc.), but the overall movement of the molecules within the solution. Vigorous agitation, for example using a magnetic stirring bar or ultrasound, makes it possible in particular to provide kinetic energy in the solution and thus destabilize the adhesion primer so that it forms radicals.<br>
Finally, the action of various types of radiation, such as electromagnetic radiation, y radiation, UV rays, or electron or ion beams can also adequately destabilize the  adhesion primer  so that  it  forms  radicals.  The<br>
15<br>
11JUN 2009<br><br>
wavelength used will be dependent on the primer used, for example 306 nm for 4-hexylbenzenediazonium.<br>
In the context of this invention, the non-electrochemical conditions allowing for the formation of radical entities are typically chosen from the group constituted by thermal, kinetic, photochemical, or radiochemical conditions and combinations thereof. Advantageously, the non-electrochemical conditions allowing for the formations of radical entities are chosen from the group constituted by thermal, chemical, photochemical or radiochemical conditions and combinations thereof with one another and/or with kinetic conditions. The non-electrochemical conditions are more specifically chemical conditions.<br>
In the context of chemical conditions, it is envisaged to add one or more chemical initiator(s) to the liquid solution as defined above. Indeed, it is also possible to adjust the chemical environment of the adhesion primer by adding one or more chemical initiator(s) to the liquid solution. The presence of chemical initiators is often combined with non-chemical environmental conditions, as mentioned above. Typically, a chemical initiator of which the stability is lower than that of the adhesion primer under the chosen environmental conditions will evolve in an unstable form, which will act on the adhesion primer and cause the formation of a radical entity based on the latter. It is also possible to use chemical initiators of which the action is not essentially related to the environmental conditions, and which are efficient on a wide range of thermal or kinetic conditions, for example. The initiator will be chosen according to the solvent used for the<br>
16<br>
11 JUN 2009<br><br>
reaction, advantageously the initiator will be soluble in the solvent.<br>
There are numerous chemical initiators for radical polymerization. Three major types can be distinguished on the basis of the environmental conditions used:<br>
thermal initiators, the most common of which are peroxides or azo compounds. Under the effect of heat, these compounds dissociate into free radicals; in this case, the reaction is performed at a minimum temperature corresponding to that necessary for the formation of radicals based on the initiator. This type of chemical initiator is generally used specifically within a certain temperature interval, according to their decomposition kinetics;<br>
photochemical or radiochemical initiators, which are excited by the radiation triggered by irradiation (usually UV, but also y radiation or electron beams) allow for the production of radicals by more or less complex mechanisms. Bu3SnH and 12 belong to photochemical or radiochemical initiators;<br>
essentially chemical initiators, which act rapidly and under normal conditions or temperature and pressure on the adhesion primer so as to allow it to form radicals. Such initiators generally have an redox (for reduction/oxidation reaction} potential that is less than the reduction potential of the adhesion primer used under the reaction conditions. Depending on the type of initiator, it can thus be a metal, generally in a finely divided form, such as metallic wool (also more commonly called "steel wool") or metal filings, reductive, such as iron, zinc, nickel, or metal salts such as a metallocene, a reductive compound such as hypophosphorous acid (H3PO2)<br>
17<br>
11JUN2009<br><br>
or ascorbic acid, or have an organic or inorganic base in proportions sufficient to allow for destabilization of the adhesion primer; a pH greater than or equal to 4 is generally sufficient. Radical reservoir-type structures, such as polymeric matrices irradiated beforehand by an electron beam or by a heavy ion beam and/or by all irradiation means cited above, can also be used as chemical initiators for destabilizing the adhesion primer and leading to the formation of radical entities based on the primer.<br>
The liquid solution implemented in the method according to the invention advantageously also includes one or more chemical primer(s) chosen from:<br>
-	a reducing metal in a finely divided form, as<br>
defined here,<br>
-	a metallocene,<br>
-an organic or inorganic base in proportions sufficient for the pH of the liquid solution to be greater than or equal to 4,<br>
-	a pre-irradiated polymeric matrix, as defined here.<br>
Among the primers capable of being used in the<br>
context of the invention, and in particular when the adhesion primer is a cleavable aryl salt such as a diazonium aryl salt, it is possible in particular to cite<br>
halogenated initiators such as iodine,  -halogenoalkyls having aryl, allyl, carbonyl or sulfonyl groups, polyhalogenated compounds such as CC14 or CHC13, compounds having highly-labile covalent bonds with halogens and generally corresponding to bonds established between a heteroatom, such as N, S or 0, and a halogen, potassium persulfate (K2S208) , azobis(isobutyronitrile) , peroxidated compounds such as benzoyl peroxide,  tert-<br>
18<br>
11 JUN 2009<br><br>
butyl peroxide, cumyl peroxide, tert-butyl perbenzoate, tert-butyl hydroperoxide, and finely-divided reductive metals such as iron, zinc, nickel, preferably in the form of filings, fine particles or metallic wool fibers, metal salts, in particular, metallocenes such as ferrocene, irradiated polymeric matrices and in particular matrices of polymers chosen from polyurethanes, polyolefines, polycarbonates, and polyethylene terephthalates, which polymers are advantageously fluorinated or even perfluorinated.<br>
The amount of initiator will be chosen according to the process conditions used. Generally, the amounts are between 5 and 20% mass of monomers, and typically around 10 %. Thus, for example, when the adhesion primer is an aryl diazonium salt, it is possible to use, as the initiator, iron filings, of which the diameter of the particles is between 50 and 250 um. It is also possible to use iron or steel wool, which will generally be (according to degree of fineness) fine (0), extra fine {00} or super fine (000). More specifically, the diameter of the wool fibers will be less than or equal to 3.81 x 10 mm and typically greater than 6.35 x 10 mm. Alternatively, it is possible to use basic conditions so that the pH of the solution is high enough to cause destabilization of the adhesion primer in the form of radicals.<br>
It is also possible to use matrices irradiated in various forms such as membranes. Typically, such a membrane will have a thickness in the micrometer range, generally between 1 and 100 um, in particular between 5 and 50 um, and, more specifically, close to 9 um. It will advantageously be a polyvinylidene fluoride  (PVDF).  In<br>
19<br>
11 JUN 2009<br><br>
particular, it is possible to use a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane irradiated with electrons. The irradiation dose is generally between 10 and 200 kGy, and more specifically 100 kGy for PVDF. Such a membrane can, for example, have dimensions of 1 cm x 2 cm x 9 urn, i.e. a total surface of around 4.0054 cm2.<br>
It is also possible to use a pre-irradiated polymeric matrix in the form of:<br>
granules,  for example with a mean diameter of 200 urn to 1 cm,<br>
-	micropartides, for example from 1 urn to 100 urn in<br>
diameter, or<br>
-	nanoparticles, generally from 5 nm to 900 nm in<br>
diameter.<br>
Indeed, the decrease in the diameter of the particles makes it possible to increase the specific contact surface and therefore the quantity of radicals at the surface with respect to the same mass of irradiated polymeric material in membrane form. Typically, the specific contact surface of the irradiated matrix available will be much lower than that of the surface of the solid support on which the grafting is to be performed.<br>
The irradiation of a polymeric matrix can consist of subjecting said matrix to an electron beam (also called electronic irradiation). More specifically, this step can consist in scanning the polymeric matrix with an accelerated electron beam, which beam can be emitted by an electron accelerator (for example, a Van de Graaf accelerator, 2.5 MeV). In the case of irradiation with an electron beam, the energy deposition is homogeneous, which means  that  the  free  radicals  created by this<br>
20<br>
11 JUN 2009<br><br>
irradiation will be distributed uniformly at the surface and in the volume of the matrix.<br>
The irradiating step of the polymeric matrix can also consist in subjecting said matrix to a heavy ion bombardment. It is specified that "heavy ions" are ions of which the mass is greater than that of carbon. Generally, these are ions chosen from krypton, lead and xenon.<br>
Whether in the context of the first embodiment or the second embodiment described above, the irradiation creates free radicals in the material constituting the matrix, which creation of free radicals is a consequence of the transfer of irradiation energy to said material.<br>
The radicals present in such an irradiated matrix can be trapped in crystallites, so as to prolong the lifetime of the matrix in its irradiated form. It is therefore recommended to use matrices comprising crystallites, and, preferably, between 30 % and 50 %, and generally 40% v/v of crystallites. Thus, for example, polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) is semi-crystalline (it is generally 40 % crystalline and 60 % amorphous) and can<br>
constituted by the planar or helical  association of<br>
common. PVDF is a thermoplastic polymer that can therefore be melted, then molded. Thus, PVDF primarily in the a phase is generally obtained by cooling from the molten state, for example after simple extrusion. PVDF primarily in the p phase is generally obtained by stretch molding of a-phase PVDF, at temperature below 50oC°C°C. It is recommended to use for the present invention PVDF comprising primarily the p phase because the crystallinity is greater in this case.<br>

To increase the quantity of radicals accessible at the surface of the irradiated polymers in the various forms described above, the specific contact surface of the polymeric materials with the solution can advantageously be increased by making them micro or nanoporous. To obtain this type of material, the irradiation step can be performed as follows:<br>
-	irradiation of the polymeric matrix by heavy ions;<br>
-	chemical exposure, generally by hydrolysis, of the latent traces created along the heavy ions tracks, resulting in open channels;<br>
-	electronic irradiation of said open channels.<br>
The chemical exposure consists in placing the matrix in contact with a reagent capable of hydrolyzing the latent traces, so as to form hollow channels in their place.<br>
According to this particular embodiment, after the irradiation of the polymeric matrix by heavy ions, the generated latent traces exhibit short chain polymers formed by splitting of the existing chains when the ion passes through the material during irradiation. In these latent traces, the speed of hydrolysis during the exposure is greater than those of the non-irradiated parts. It is thus possible to perform selective exposure.<br>
The reagents capable of ensuring the exposure of the latent traces are dependent on the material constituting the matrix. Thus, the latent traces can in particular be treated by a highly basic and oxidizing solution, such as a KOH ION solution in the presence of KMn04 at 0.25 % by weight at a temperature of 65°C°C, when the polymeric matrix is, for example, constituted by polyvinylidene fluoride    (PVDF),    poly(VDF-co-HFP)    (vinylidene-co-<br>
22<br>
11 JUN 2009<br><br>
hexafluoropropene fluoride), poly(VDF-co-TrFE) (vinylidene-co-trifluoroethylene fluoride), poly(VDF-co-TrFE-co-ChloroTrFE) (vinylidene-co-t:rif luoroethylene-co-monochlorotrifluoroethylene fluoride) and other perfluorinated polymers. A treatment with a basic solution, optionally combined with a sensitization of the traces by UV, can be sufficient, for example, for polymers such as polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polycarbonate (PC) . The treatment leads to the formation of hollow cylindrical pores, the diameter of which can be modulated according to the duration of the treatment with the basic and oxidizing solution. The irradiation will generally be performed so that the resulting membrane has between 106 and 1011 traces per cm2. It will typically be between 5.107 and 5.1010, more specifically on the order of 1010 for membranes. Other information concerning reagents and the process conditions that can be used for chemical exposure according to the material constituting the matrix can be found in Rev. Mod. Phys., Vol. 55, N° 4, Oct. 1983, p. 925.<br>
After that exposure step, the electron irradiation is performed to cause the formation of free radicals on the wall of the channels, with the implementation in this case being similar to that described for electron irradiation in general. The beam is generally oriented in a direction normal to the surface of the membrane, and the surface thereof is scanned homogeneously. The irradiation dose generally ranges from 10 to 200 kGy, and will typically be close to 100 kGy for PVDF. The dose is generally such that it is greater than the "gel dose". The latter corresponds to the dose at which the recombinations between radicals are promoted, leading to<br>
23<br>
11 JUN 2009<br><br>
the creation of interchain bonds leading to the formation of a three-dimensional (or cross-linked) network, i.e. the formation of a gel. Thus, using a dose greater than the "gel dose" generates cross-linking within the matrix, thus enabling the mechanical properties of the end polymer to be improved in the same single step that generates the free radicals.<br>
As a non-limiting example, the specific contact surface of a 2-cm2 PVDF membrane with a thickness of 9 um increases from around 4 cm2 to around 60 cm2 after irradiation-induced creation of 1010 pores per cm2 with an average diameter of 10 nm, thus enabling 15 times more radicals present at the surface than for the same non-porous membrane.<br>
The liquid solution according to the present invention can further comprise at least one surfactant as hereinafter described and disclosed.<br>
The solid support of which the surface is treated according to the method of the invention can be of any type. Indeed, it is at the surface of the sample in contact with the solution that the radical grafting reaction will take place. Thus, the surface of the solid support to be treated in accordance with the method according to this invention typically has at least one atom capable of being involved in a radical reaction. The solid support can be electrically conductive or non-conductive. The solid support can have a more or less large surface and a variable roughness. The method is applicable to samples of nanometric or metric size. Thus, for example, the method can be applied to surfaces of nano-objects such as nanoparticles or nanotubes, typically carbon, or to more complex devices.<br>

The invention is applicable to a wide variety of surfaces of interest, of which the composition may be chosen from a wide variety of materials. Indeed, the method uses grafting of a purely radical type, and does not require the surface to have specific limiting characteristics such as high conductivity. Thus, the surface can be organic or non-organic, and can also be of a composite nature and have a non-uniform composition. Any surface having one or more atom(s) or atom group (s) capable of being involved in a radical addition or substitution reaction, such as CH, carbonyls {ketone, ester, acid, aldehyde), OH, ethers, amines, or halogens, such as F, CI and Br, is in particular concerned by this invention.<br>
The solid support can have an inorganic surface that can be chosen from conductive materials such as metals, noble metals, oxidized metals, transition metals, metal alloys and, for example, Ni, Zn, Au, Pt, ■ Ti, and steel. The inorganic surface can also be chosen from semiconductive materials such as Si, SiC, AsGa, Ga, and so on. It is also possible to apply the method to solid supports having a non-conductive surface such as non-conductive oxides such as Si02, AI2O3 and MgO. More generally, the inorganic surface of the solid support can be constituted, for example, by an amorphous material such as glass, generally containing silicates, or even ceramic, as well as crystalline such as diamond.<br>
The solid support can have an organic surface. As an organic surface, it is possible to cite natural polymers, such as latex or rubber, or artificial polymers such as derivatives of polyamide or polyethylene, and in particular polymers having n-type bonds such as polymers<br>
25<br>
11 JUN 2009<br><br>
with ethylene bonds, carbonyl groupings and imine. It is also possible to apply the method to more complex organic surfaces, such as surfaces including polysaccharides, such as cellulose for wood or paper, artificial or natural fibers, such as cotton or felt, or fluoro-polymers such as polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE). It is of course possible to apply the method to a surface corresponding to a primer layer as defined above.<br>
The solid support and/or the surface of the solid support implemented in the context of this invention are advantageously constituted by a material chosen from the group constituted by metals, wood, paper, cotton, felt, silicon, carbon nanotubes, fluoro-polymers and diamond.<br>
According to a specific embodiment, the surface of the solid support on which the organic film is to be formed is equipped with a mask that covers it at least partially and that insulates it from the liquid solution. The mask typically corresponds to a physical entity that is neither grafted to the surface nor covalently bonded thereto. It can in particular be a bulk material or a thin film of material, typically several angstrom to several microns, generally organic, deposited on the surface.<br>
The mask makes it possible to locally "mask" the chemical reactivity of the surface with regard to the radicals generated during the process and thus leads to the controlled formation of a film solely on the portions of the surface exposed to the solution, with the areas of the surface of the support equipped with the mask being protected from the formation of the organic film. The surface of the solid support contacted with the liquid solution as defined above thus typically comprises at<br>
26<br><br><br>
least one area covered with a mask. After removal of the mask at the end of the operation, the surface that was protected, unlike the surface that was not equipped with a mask, does not comprise a grafted film.<br>
The mask will preferably be constituted by a thin layer of inorganic or organic material acting as a layer of lower cohesion that can easily be removed under gentle conditions. A layer of material is considered as such insofar as it does not require the use of extreme conditions detrimental to the grafted film. Typically, the gentle conditions correspond to a simple chemical wash, generally performed with a solvent, an ultrasound treatment in a solvent or an increase in temperature. It is of course desirable for the mask not to be soluble in the reaction solvent present in the liquid solution, i.e. used in the grafting reaction. Thus, it is recommended to use a mask that has a higher affinity for the surface than it has for the reaction solvent.<br>
The material constituting the mask can thus be chosen from a wide range of materials. It will generally be chosen according to the nature of the solid support. Advantageously, the mask is composed of alkylthiols, in particular long-chain alkylthiols, often at C15-C20 and typically at Cig.<br>
The mask can react with the radicals generated during the process. In every case, it is possible to remove it so as to expose the areas of the solid support surface protected from the grafting on which no organic film will be observed (similar to the so-called "lift¬off" methods in lithography).<br>
The mask deposition techniques are known to a person skilled in the art. They can involve,  in particular,<br>
27<br>
11 JUN 2009<br><br>
coating vapor deposition or immersion. Thus,    the   mask, in the form of a thin layer of material, can be deposited, for example, by direct drawing with a felt (pencil-type) pen impregnated with the chosen material. On glass, it is possible, for example, to use, as a mask, a marker such as those provided for paper, or else greasy substance like wax.  It  is also possible to use the so-called microcontact  printing  method.  This  technique  can  be applied in particular if the surface of the solid support has a strong affinity for sulfur atoms, such as a gold surface. In this case the mask will generally be composed of alkylthiols, in particular long-chain alkylthiols (so-called microcontact printing techniques), often at C15-C20 anc}  typically  at  C18-  More  generally  the  classic lithography techniques can be useq to form the mask: spin-coating, then insulation through a physical mask or viei   a light beam or controllable particles, then exposure.<br>
According to another embodiment of this invention, the method for preparing an organic film at the surface of a solid support is characterized in that it includes a step of contacting said surface with a liquid solution comprising:<br>
at least one solvent, at least one adhesion primer,<br>
at least one radically Polymerizable monomer,<br>
said monomer being different from the adhesion<br>
primer,<br>
under non-electrochemical conditions  and enabling the<br>
formation of  radical  entities based on the  adhesion<br>
primer.<br>
Everything described above concerning the adhesion primer  and  the  possibilities  for action  on  its<br>
28<br>
11 JUN 2009<br><br>
environment, the solvent, either protic or aprotic and in which the monomer is advantageously soluble, the support, the possible chemical primers and a possible mask, also applies to the embodiment described above.<br>
The radically polymerizable monomers implemented in the context of this invention correspond to monomers capable of polymerizing under radical conditions after initiation by a radical chemical entity. Typically, it involves molecules comprising at least one ethylene-type bond. The vinyl monomers, in particular the monomers described in the patent application FR 05 02516 as well as in patent FR 03 11491, are particularly concerned.<br>
According to a particularly advantageous embodiment of the invention, the vinyl monomer(s) is (are) chosen from the monomers of the following formula (II):<br><br>
in which the R1 to R4 groups, identical or different, represent a non-metallic monovalent atom such as a halogen atom, a hydrogen atom, a saturated or unsaturated chemical group, such as an alkyl or aryl group, a -COOR5 group in which R5 represents a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group in C1-C12 and preferably Ca-Cg, a nit rile, a carbonyl, an amine or an amide.<br>
The above-mentioned compounds of formula (II) are in particular chosen from the group constituted by vinyl acetate, acrylonitrile, methacrylonitrile, methyl methacrylate, ethyl methacrylate, butyl methacrylate, propyl    methacrylate,    hydroxyethyl    methacrylate,<br>
29<br>
111 JUN ®W<br><br>
hydroxypropyl methacrylate, glycidyl methacrylate and their derivatives; the acrylamides and in particular the aminoethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl and hexyl acrylamides and in particular methacrylamides, the cyanoacrylates, the di-acrylates and di-methacrylates, the tri-acrylates and tri-methacrylates, the tetra-acrylates and tetra-methacrylates (such as tetramethacrylate pentaerythritol), styrene and its derivatives, parachloro-styrene, pentafluoro-styrene, N-vinyl pyrrolidone, 4-vinyl pyridine, 2-vinyl pyridine, the vinyl halides, acryloyl or methacryloyl, di-vinylbenzene (DVB), and - more generally the vinyl cross-linking agents based on aerylate, methacrylate and their derivatives.<br>
According to a specific embodiment, the monomers used are those that, unlike the components that are soluble in any proportion in the solvent considered, are soluble only to a certain proportion in the solvent, i.e. the value of their solubility in said solvent is finite. The monomers that can be used in accordance with the method of the invention can thus be chosen from the compounds of which the solubility in the solvent is finite, and more specifically less than 0.1 M, more preferably between 5.10~z and 10~6 M. Among such monomers, it is possible, for example, to cite butyl methacrylate and methyl methacrylate of which the solubility in water, measured under normal conditions of temperature and pressure, is respectively around 2.5.10~3 and 4.10"2 M. According to the invention, and unless otherwise indicated,  the  normal  conditions  of  temperature  and<br>
pressure (NTP) correspond to a temperature of 25°C and to-a pressure of 1.105 Pa.<br>
30<br>
I11 JUN 2009<br><br>
The invention also applies to a mixture of two, three, four or more monomers chosen from the monomers described above.<br>
The amount of polymerizable monomers in the solution may vary as desired by the experimenter. This amount can be greater than the solubility of the monomer considered in the reaction solvent used, and can be, for example, 18 to 40 times the solubility of said monomer in the solution at a given temperature, generally room temperature or the temperature of the reaction. Under these conditions, it is advantageous to use means allowing for the dispersion of the monomer molecules in the solution, such as a surfactant or ultrasound.<br>
When the solvent is protic, according to a specific embodiment of the invention, it is recommended to add a surfactant when the monomer has a solubility of less than 5.10"2 M. A precise description of the surfactants that can be used in the context of the invention is provided in patent applications FR 06 01804 and FR 06 08945 and in the literature (Deniau et al., Chem. Mater. 2006, 18, 5421-5428), to which a person skilled in the art can refer. A single surfactant or a mixture of a plurality of surfactants can be used. The amount of surfactant(s) necessary is variable; it must in particular be enough to allow for the formation of the organic film. The minimum amount of surfactant(s) can easily be determined by sampling solutions with identical compositions but variable surfactant concentrations. In general, the surfactant concentration is such that the critical micellar concentration (CMC) is reached and the formation of micelles can thus take place. The CMC of a surfactant can be determined by methods known to a person skilled in<br>
31   11JUN2009<br><br>
the art, for example, by measuring surface tensions. Typically, the surfactant concentration will be between 0.5 mM and around 5 M, preferably between 0.1 mM and around 150 mM. The recommended surfactant concentration is usually 10 mM.<br>
The   surfactants   are   molecules   comprising   a<br>
lipophilic portion  (apolar)  and a hydrophilic portion<br>
(polar). Among the surfactants that can be used according<br>
to  the  invention,  the  following  can  be  cited  in<br>
particular:<br>
i) anionic surfactants of which the hydrophilic portion is negatively charged; the surfactant will preferably be an alkyl or an aryl sulfonate, sulfate, phosphate or sulfosuccxnate associated with a counterion such as an ammonium ion (NH/) , a quaternary ammonium such as tetrabutylammonium, and the alkaline cations such as NaT, Li+ and K+;<br>
ii) cationic surfactants of which the hydrophilic portion is positively charged; they are preferably chosen from the quaternary ammoniums comprising at least one aliphatic chain in C4-C22 associated with an anionic counterion chosen in particular from the boron derivatives such as tetrafluoroborate or the halogenide ions such as F~, Br~, I" or Cl~;<br>
iii) zwitterionic surfactants, which are neutral compounds having formal unit electrical charges of opposite sign; they are preferably chosen from the compounds having an alkyl chain in C5-C20 generally substituted by a negatively charged function such as a sulfate or a carboxylate and a positively charged function such as an ammonium;<br>
11JUN 2009<br><br>
iv) Amphoteric surfactants, which are compounds acting both as an acid or as a base according to the medium in Which they are placed; these compounds can have a zwitteriQnic nature; amino acids are a speci'jfic exampxe of this family,<br>
v) neutral surfactants (non-ionic): the surfactant properties, in particular hydrophilia, are provided by non-chargeq functional groupings such as an alcohol, an ether, an ester or an amide, containing heteroatoms such as nitrogen or oxygen; due to the low hydrophilic contribution of these functions, the non-ionic surfactant compounds are usually polyfunctional.<br>
Charged surfactants can of course have a plurality of charges.<br>
As antonic surfactants, it is for example possible to use tetraethylammonium paratoluenesulfonate, sodium dodecylsulfate, sodium palmitate, sodium stearate, sodium myristate, sodium di(2-ethylhexyl) sulfosuccinate, methyl benzene sulfonate and ethyl benzene sulfonate.<br>
As cationic surfactants, it is possible for example to use tetrabutylammonium    chloride,     tetradecylammonium chloride,  tetradecyltrimethyl ammonium bromide  (TTAB), alkylpyridinium halogenides carrying an aliphatic chain and alkylammonium halogenides.<br>
As zwitterionic surfactants, it is possible to use sodium N,N-dimethyldodecylammoniumbutanate, sodium dimethyldodeclyammonium propanate and the amino acids.<br>
As amphoteric surfactants, it is possible to use disodium lauroamphodiacetate, betaines such as alkylamidopropylbetaine or laurylhydr oxysulfobetaine.<br>
As non-ionic surfactants, it is possible to use polyethers such as polyethoxylated surfactants such as,<br>
  ,11 JUN 2009<br><br>
for example, polyethyleneglycol laurylether (POE23 or Brij ® 35), polyols {surfactants derived from sugars) in particular glucose alkylates such as, for example glucose hexanate.<br>
Among the preferred surfactants according to the invention, it is possible to cite the anionic surfactants such as sulfonates, quaternary ammoniums and non-ionic surfactants such as polyoxyethylenes.<br>
According to another embodiment of the invention, it is possible to use ultrasound to promote the solubilization of the monomer or to form a dispersion when the monomer is insoluble in the medium [R. Asami et al. Langmuir B, 2006, in press].<br>
According to the provisions presented, the solubility of the monomer appears not to be an obstacle to the method owing to the use of technical means, such as vigorous agitation, which can be induced by ultrasound, which allow for the formation of a dispersion and/or an emulsion, for the liquid monomer (s) . In the case of polymerizable monomer(s) not having an affinity for the solvent used, such as non-water soluble monomers, it is therefore advantageous for the solution to be in the form of an emulsion or a dispersion. It is also possible to switch from one family of solvent to the other and to consequently adapt the initiator.<br>
In an alternative, particularly in the case of protic solvents, the method according to this invention includes a preliminary step in which the polymerizable monomer or the mixture of polymerizable monomers is dispersed or emulsified in the presence of at least one surfactant, or by ultrasound, before its mixture with the<br>
11JUN2009<br><br>
liquid solution including at least one protic solvent and at least one adhesion primer.<br>
The method is generally carried out under gentle and non-destructive conditions either for the surface of the sample on which the film is to be grafted, or for the monomer that may be used. Thus, it is desirable to work under conditions in which the monomer does not deteriorate. In addition, the temperature of the reaction medium is limited by the reaction solvent, which is preferably preserved in liquid form. The method is carried out between 0 and 100°C and generally under normal conditions of temperature and pressure (NTP), depending on where the user is, often at around 25°C at a pressure of around 1 atm.<br>
The reaction time can be adjusted. Indeed, the adjustment of the time of exposure of the surface of the solid support to the solution makes it possible to vary the thickness of the film that is obtained. It is of course possible for the same type of surface to precisely calibrate the process conditions that the user considers to be optimal. The analysis means described in the examples below are particularly suitable for determining in particular the thickness of the film, its composition and, incidentally, the reaction time. It is, for example, possible to obtain films of which the thickness is between 2 nm and 200 nm causing the reaction time to vary between 1 and 15 minutes, for a diazonium salt concentration of 5.10~2 M, or a monomer concentration of 0.9 M and a diazonium salt concentration of 5.10"2 M. '<br>
In one alternative, and when taking advantage of the presence of a monomer different from the adhesion primer,<br>
35<br>
11 JUN 2009<br><br>
the method according to the invention can include the following steps, consisting of:<br>
a)	adding at least one monomer to a solution<br>
containing at least one adhesion primer different from<br>
said monomer in the presence of at least one solvent and<br>
optionally at least one chemical initiator,<br>
b)	placing the solution obtained in step (a) under<br>
non-electrochemical conditions allowing for the formation<br>
of radical entities based on the adhesion primer and<br>
possibly based on the chemical initiator,<br>
c)	placing the surface of the solid support in<br>
contact with the solution of step (b).<br>
In a second alternative of thQ method according to the invention, the latter can include the following steps, consisting of:<br>
a' ) placing the surface of the solid support in contact with a solution containing $t least one adhesion primer in the presence of at least one solvent, and possibly at least one chemical initiator and at least one monomer,<br>
b' ) placing the surface of the solid support in contact with the solution of step (a' ) under non-electrochemical conditions allowing for the formation of radical entities based on the Adhesion primer and possibly based on the chemical initiator,<br>
c' ) possibly adding at least one monomer to the solution obtained in step (b' ) .<br>
In the second alternative of the method as defined above, it is possible to envisage the following three cases:<br>
i. the monomers are not present in the solution of step (a') and are added only in step (c'). This case is<br>
  11 JUN 2009<br><br>
particularly advantageous when the monomer used is relatively insoluble and in particular in an aqueous solution; when the monomer is- non-water-soluble and the adhesion primer is diazonium salt. Thus, in step (c'), the monomer can be added to the solution in particular in the same solvent as that used in step (a' ) and advantageously in the form of an emulsion or a dispersion produced previously using ultrasound or surfactants.<br>
ii. 'the monomers are present in the solution of step (a') and the method does not have a step (c' ) . This case applies in particular when the primer is a diazonium salt and when the monomer is water-soluble. The method according to the first alternative can also be used in this case.<br>
iii. one portion of the monomers is present in the solution of step (a') and another portion of the monomers of the same or of a different type is added only in step (C).<br>
As explained above, the adhesion primer can be introduced either to the solution (s) as is, or prepared in   situ  in the solution.<br>
The method according to this invention advantageously comprises an additional step, prior to the grafting, of cleaning the surface on which the organic film is to be formed, in particular by brushing and/or polishing; an additional ultrasound treatment with an organic solvent such as ethanol, acetone or dimethylformamide (DMF) is even recommended.<br>
According to specific provisions, it is possible to produce, using the method of this invention, organic films essentially of the statistical or sequential polymer type.<br><br><br>
1 1 JUN 2009<br><br>
To prepare a sequential film, it is sufficient to prepare, as described above, a layer of a first polymer on the surface of a solid support, then to re-start the experiment by changing the type of the monomer in solution. It is thus possible to iteratively produce a alternate film of high quality (figure la) . During each of the successive steps, the adhesion primer will be grafted on the surface at its contact and will allow for the growth of a film based on the monomer or monomers present in the solution. Between each of the grafting sequences, it is entirely possible to perform a cleaning of the surface obtained.<br>
To obtain a statistical copolymer (figure 7b), it is sufficient to use monomers of different types in the solution. The exact composition of the film is, in this case, based on the reactivity of each of the monomers present.<br>
The organic films obtained according to the methods described above are thus essentially polymeric or copolymeric, from a plurality of monomeric units of identical or different chemical species and/or adhesion primer molecules. The films obtained by the method of this invention are "essentially" of the polymer type insofar as the film also incorporates species resulting from the adhesion primer and not only the monomers present. An organic film in the context of this invention is in particular a film prepared from at least one type of polymerizable monomer, particularly radically polymerizable, and at least one type of adhesion primer. The organic film in the context of this invention advantageously has a monomer unit sequence in which the first unit is constituted by a derivative of the adhesion<br>
  tt 1JUN 2009<br><br>
primer,  and the other units are indifferently derived from adhesion primers and polymerizable monomers.<br>
The thickness  of the  film is easy to estimate according to the method of this invention, as   explained above. For each of the parameters, and on the basis of each of the reagents used, a person skilled in the art will be capable of iteratively determining the optimum conditions for obtaining a film of variable thickness. It is also useful to refer to the examples showing the invention and demonstrating that it is possible,  for example,  to produce films of which the thickness  is between several nanometers and several hundred nanometers. The method described above also makes it possible to obtain supports comprising function&amp;lisable films. These typically correspond to films having, on their surface, chemical groups capable of reacting with another chemical group,  typically outside of the film,  to form ionic, covalent or hydrogen bonds. A group responding to this definition will be called a chemical functionalisation group {CFG) throughout the remainder of this document. Such groups generally correspond to groups comprising at least one covalent bond between a heteroatom and another element corresponding to a carbon, a hydrogen or another heteroatom. The heteroatom(s) are generally chosen from N, 0, S, CI, Br and Si. A person skilled in the art can in particular  consult  the  international  application  WO 2004/005410,  which  describes  a  method  involving  the modification of the chemical functions of the films and which can    easily be applied to the method of this invention.<br>
A functionalisable film can thus comprise a CFG, which can in particular be chosen from the hydroxy 1,<br>

thiol, azide, epoxide, azyridine, amine, nitrile, isocyanate, thiocyanate, nitro, amide, halogenide and carbonyl functions, such as carboxylic acids, aldehydes, ketones, acid halogenides, esters and active esters, and among the alkenes or the alkynes.<br>
As an example of functionalisable films derived from a primer alone such as a diazonium salt, it is in particular possible to cite the films derived from primers, in this case diazoniums, presented in table 1 with their associated CFG.<br><br><br>

A person skilled in the art is capable of choosing the type of film, in particular among the vinyl monomer films, to be used according to the CFG to be integrated in the film present on the support. It may be useful for a person skilled in the art to consult the international application WO 2004/005410.<br>
Insofar as a CFG is not directly available to a person skilled in the art from the films that he/she is capable of preparing, it is of course possible to modify the CFGs of the film by means of one or more simple chemical reactions. Thus, for example, a film derived from acrylic acid, which comprises a CO2H function as CFG can be modified by a reaction with thionyl chloride {SOCI2) to form a film comprising acid chlorides as CFG. Similarly, in the context of a nitrobenzene film having a nitro function as CFG, it can be reduced by iron to yield a film having an amine as CFG. A polyacrylonitrile film comprising a nitrile grouping as CFG makes it possible, for example, after treatment with LiAlH4, to obtain a film comprising an amine as CFG. It may be useful for a person skilled in the art to refer to the international application WO 2004/005410.<br>
Access to functionalisable films allows for their subsequent functionalisation. Thus, according to a nart-inilar nrnvisinn. the method for preparing an organic<br>
43     11  JUN 2009<br><br>
film on a support, as described above, can comprise an additional functionalisation step, with such a step being applicable in particular to functionalisable films.<br>
The functionalisation can be produced by contacting the surface of a film, in particular obtained by the method described above, which is functionalisable and particularly with a CFG of the filrn, with a graft. The contact can be performed with a solution, called a "functionalisation solution", comprising at least one graft.<br>
The reaction will in particular take place at the surface of the film, but also throughout the film according to the CFGs present, the thickness of the film and the solvent of the solution.<br>
Among the chemical reactions that can be produced on CFGs, it is possible to cite, for example, nucleophilic additions and substitutions, electrophilie additions and substitutions, cycloaddition reactions, rearrangements, transpositions and metatheses, as well as more generally click-chemistry reactions (Sharpies et al. , Angew. Chem. Int. Ed., 2001, 40, 2004-2021). The type of reaction is of course dependent on the graft that the user wants to link with the CFGs of the film. A person skilled in the art can easily find, in general organic chemistry literature, comprehensive lists of chemical reactions in which a CFG can be involved.<br>
The solvent of the solution comprising the graft will preferably be a swelling solvent. Such a solvent corresponds to a solvent capable of penetrating the organic film present on the support. Such solvents, when they are placed in contact with the film, generally cause swelling of the film that can be seen by optical means,<br>
44       11 JUN 2009<br><br>
by the naked eye, or by simple optical microscopy. A standard test to determine whether a solvent is particularly suitable for a film consists of depositing a drop of solvent on the surface of the film and observing whether the drop is absorbed into the film. It is desirable to use, among a set of solvents tested, those for which the absorption is the fastest. The use of such a solvent leads to a deeper grafting of the graft in the film. Of course, it is also preferable for the reagents used for the reaction to be soluble in such a solvent.<br>
In the sense of the invention, a graft corresponds to an organic compound capable of reacting with the functionalisable film and particularly with a CFG of the functional i sable film. The graft can be any type of organic molecule insofar as it has a group capable of reacting with a CFG of the support film.<br>
The graft can comprise, in its structure, a group of interest (GI) corresponding to a substructure having one or more properties of interest, as well as optionally a linking group (LG) corresponding to a structure essentially free of properties of interest. The functionalisation is advantageously performed by means of the LG, which has a group capable of reacting with the CFG.<br>
The graft, and especially the GI, can in particular have a chelating structure, or a biologically active structure. The GI can thus in particular be chosen from the cyclodextrins (CD), such as peranhydrocyclodextrin derivatives, calixarenes, such as calix[4]arene, porphyrins, such as tetrakis (benzoic acid)-4,4',4',4" '-(Porphyrin-5,10,15,20-tetrayl) , and their derivatives that have chelation properties. The GI can<br>
  11JUN 2009<br><br>
also for example be chosen from the polysaccharides and the polypeptides.<br>
The linking group (LG) generally corresponds to a gr-cup that does not develop an interaction other than that of a steric, hydrophilic or hydrophobic nature or an affinity with the GI, and that does not react significantly with it (not detectably). It can typically for example be essentially an aliphatic chain, i.e. an alkyl chain, preferably 1 to 22 and typically 3 to 16 carbon atoms, an aromatic chain or a heterocyclic chain, such as a Polyether. The LG advantageously comprises one or more reactive heteroatoms capable of reacting with a CFG.<br>
As shown in the reading above, it is possible, according to the method of the invention, to prepare a film comprising grafted molecules and having properties of interest at the surface of a support. Such films can in particular correspond to chelation or filtration films or to films having biomolecules. It may be useful for a person skilled in the art to refer to the international application wo 2004/005410 for examples of molecules that it is possible to graft.<br>
According to a specific functionalisation modality, it is possible to obtain supports coated with an organic complexing film. To do this, it is necessary to functionali&gt;e the film with complexing or chelating groups such as   cyclodextrins, porphyrins and calixarenes.<br>
According to another functionalisation modality, it is possible to obtain supports coated with an organic film   comprising   biomolecules   such   as   proteins, polypeptide^, peptides, antibodies and antibody fragments, polysaccharides or oligonucleotides. The graft typically<br>
46<br>
1 1JUN2009<br><br>
corresponds to a derivative of a biomolecule. Thus, for example, from a support having a film comprising polymethacrylonitrile, obtained by means of a diazonium and methacrylonitrile, it is possible to graft a protein such as avidine and to verify its activity according to the modalities described in the international patent WO 2004/005410.<br>
This invention also relates to a non-electrically-conductive solid support on which an organic film is grafted, of which the first unit covalently bound to said non-electrxcally-conductive support is a derivative of an adhesion primer. The non-electrically conductive solid support according to this invention can possibly have a mask as defined above.<br>
The organic film advantageously includes, in addition to the first unit covalently bound to the non-electrically-conductive support derived from an adhesion primer, monomers of the same or different type bound to one another by a radical reaction, and possibly derivatives of the adhesion primer. Thus, as explained above, the organic film is essentially a polymer film. More specifically, it can be in the form of a sequential polymer film or a statistical copolymer film. The non-electrically-conductive solid supports, the adhesion primers and the monomers are as defined above. The solid support, according to the invention can also comprise grafts grafted as described above.<br>
According to another embodiment of the invention, it is possible to obtain organic films comprising nano-objects. In the sense of this invention, an organic film comprising nano-objects,  such as nanoparticles  (NPs), nanocrystals   (NCs)   or  nanotubes   (NTs),   typically<br>
 									11 JUN 2009<br><br>
corresponds to a film at the surface and within which nano-objects (NBs) are present.<br>
This embodiment can be applied to a support coated with an organic film and in particular a support coated with an organic film covalently bound to its surface. It will typically be a support obtained by a method as described above.<br>
Thus, this embodiment corresponds in particular to a method for preparing an organic film comprising nano-objects based on a solid support coated with an organic film, typically obtained by the method described above, characterized in that the surface of the support is placed in contact with a suspension of at least one nano-object (NB) in a suspension solvent and in that the film and the nano-object have a physicochemical affinity.<br>
A nano-object (NB) corresponds to an object of nanometric size, generally with its largest size being smaller than 1 m and typically smaller than 25 nm. It can in particular be a nanoparticle (NP), a nanocrystal (NC), a nanowire or a nanotube (NT), or a nanocolumn. It is clear that the NBs concerned here will advantageously have a size smaller than the thickness of the organic film present on the support, advantageously with their largest dimension not exceeding 20 %, generally 10 % and typically 5 % of the thickness of the organic film.<br>
There is a physico-chemical affinity between the film and the NBs when it is possible to correlate the duration of contact between the suspension and the surface of the support with a reduction in the NB concentration in the solution, a plateau value generally being reached, independently of any demixing of the NBs in the suspension.  It is thus possible to determine<br>
48<br>
11 JUN 2009<br><br>
NB/organic film pairs between which there is an affinity. The affinity is generally due to weak or strong interactions that develop between the surface of the NBs and the film. Among the weak interactions, it is possible to cite in particular hydrogen bonds, ionic bonds, complexing bonds, pi interactions ("pi stacking"), Van der Waals bonds, hydrophobic bonds (or surfactant-type apolar bonds); among the strong bonds, it is possible to cite the covalent  bonds   that   can   form  spontaneously.<br>
The structure of the NBs is variable. It is simple or complex. A simple NB is constituted by a single material, often a NP, a NC, a nanowire or a nanocolumn, nevertheless capable of having a variable constitution, in particular in the case of a NB non-uniformly doped throughout its volume. A complex NB generally has various structural elements or parts of which the composition is clearly distinct. It can, for example, involve artificial assemblies of nanometric size having organic and inorganic structures or NPs comprising ligands or NPs with multiple coatings. A complex NB can be constituted by a plurality of simple NBs.<br>
In a non-exhaustive manner, NBs can in particular comprise at least one metal. The metals can in particular be chosen from the noble metals and the transition metals, the metals of groups IIIA, IVA and VA of the periodic table of elements,  their alloys,  the oxides and the metallic carbides, mixtures of these materials and alloys. They can also be doped, in particular by elements such as nitrogen,   boron   and   rare   earth   elements.   More specifically, the invention applies to gold, platinum, palladium,  rhodium,  ruthenium,  cobalt,  nickel,  silver, copper, titanium oxide,  iron oxide, and iron-platinum,<br>
49<br>
11 JUN 2009<br><br>
iron palladium, gold-platinum and cobalt-platinum alloys. The NBs can also be constituted solely by the elements cited above. In this case, they will be metallic NBs.<br>
The NBs can also comprise a semiconductor or an inorganic insulator. This can be, for example, compounds of formula AB with A being an element of which the oxidation state is +11 and B being an element of which the oxidation state is -II. Typically A is chosen from Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba, Zn, Cd, Hg, Sn, Pb and mixtures of these elements, and B is chosen from 0, S, Se, Te and mixtures of these elements. Among the semiconductors, it is also possible to cite the semiconductors of formula CD with C being an element of which the oxidation state is till and D being an element of which the oxidation state is -III. Typically, C is chosen from Al, Ga, In and mixtures of these elements, and D is chosen from N, P, As, Sb, Bi and mixtures of these elements. The semiconductors of formula ECB2 with E being an element of which the oxidation state is +1, C being an element of which the oxidation state is +III and B being an element of which the oxidation state is -II, in which B and C are chosen as above, and E being chosen from Cu, Ag and Au, are also concerned by the invention. Finally, it is of course possible to use simpler semiconductors such as Si or Ge, as well as their oxides and carbides, or insulators such as diamond. The semiconductors can be in an intrinsic or doped form. The NBs can also be constituted solely by the elements cited above.<br>
The NBs can also comprise an element of an organic nature. In this case, and for complex NBs, this generally involves specific molecular edifices such as stabilizers or organic ligands or coating films. For simple NBs, it<br>
50<br><br><br>
generally involves carbon in a specific structural form such as a nanotube or a fullerene. The NBs can also be constituted solely by the elements mentioned above.<br>
According to the invention, and in order to give the user greater flexibility, it is recommended to use functionalized nano-objects. A NB is said to be "functionalized" when its surface comprises one or more BGi having an affinity for the "host film", which is the film present on the support. In the case of a simple NB, BGi can thus correspond to a chemical function present at the surface, such as the OH functions, which are present on silica particles as well as shown in the examples. In the case of a complex NB, BG1 can be present on one of the elements or on only one of the parts of the NB, and, for example in the case of a NP comprising stabilizing elements, ligands or having a coating, BG1 can be present on a plurality of organic stabilizers or on the coating.<br>
A stabilizer corresponds to an organic molecule bound to the surface of the core of the nano-object and that maintains the NB in the colloidal state. It may be useful in this field for a person skilled in the art to refer to Roucoux et al., Chem. Rev. 2002, 102, 3757-3778. Thus, according to a first possibility, a functionalized nano-object typically has an inorganic core, or at least its surface is inorganic, constituted by at least one metal and/or at least one semiconductor or an insulator as defined above, to which at least one stabilizer comprising an organic group BG1 is bound. According to the number of stabilizing molecules present, it is possible to speak of an organic crown. According to a second possibility, it is also possible to use a functionalized NB comprising an organic coating. Such a<br><br><br>
functionalized NB can in particular be obtained by the method for preparing an organic film at the surface of a support described above applied to a NB, i.e. corresponding to the core to be coated. In this case, it should be noted that, in consideration of the great flexibility with which the method for preparing an organic film at the surface of a support as described above can be applied, the nature of the core may be variable, both simple and complex, and inorganic and organic. For further details, it may be useful to refer to what has been described as well as the examples that illustrate the application to various surfaces. The organic film will be prepared so that it comprises a BGi group.<br>
Typically, stabilizers are chosen from amphiphilic molecules such as surfactants or polyoxanions, polymers such as PVP (polyvinylpyrolydone), PEG (polyethylene glycol), charged low-molecular-weight molecules, in general less than 200 g.mol"1, such as sodium citrate or sodium acetate, and finally chemical coordination ligands such as Lewis bases such as BINAP derivatives (2,2'-bis(diphenylphosphino)-1,1'-binaphthyl).<br>
The stabilizers that can be used in the context of the invention for the functionalized NBs comprising a core composed of a metal and/or a semiconductor and/or an insulator, or of which the surface has such a composition, are in particular ligands of formula (III):<br>
BG1 - (SG)P - Y<br>
in which:<br>
52<br>
1 JUN2009<br><br>
Y represents an atom or- a group of atoms capable of binding to a metal and/or a semiconductor compound and/or an insulator;<br>
SG represents a spacer group; BG1 is as defined above; p is equal to 0 or 1. According  to  the  invention,  y  will  be  chosen according to the core of the NB that is used in the context  of  the  method.  Y  can  bind  covalently,  by complexing, by chelation, or by electrostatic interaction at the surface of the core. It may be useful, in order to determine  the  structure  most  suitable  for  the  NB considered, for a person skilled in the art to refer to the prior art and in particular (Colloids and Colloid Assemblies, Frank Caruso (Ed. ) , 1. E;d. Dec. 2 003, Wiley-VCH,  Weinheim or Templeton,  A.  C, ;  Wuelfing,  W.  P. ; Murray, R. W., Monolayer-Protected Cluster Molecules. Ace. Chem. Res. 2000, 33 (1), 27 -36.<br>
Y can in particular be a thiol,  a dithiol,  a carbodithioate, dithiocarbamate, xanthate, when the core, or the surface of the core, corresponds to a metal such as gold, silver, copper, platinum, palladium or when it corresponds to an AB semiconductor such as CdSe, CdTe, ZnO, PbSe, PbS, CuInS2, CuInSe2 or Cu(In,Ga)Se2- In the case of cores composed of oxides,  such as titanium, zirconium, aluminum or iron oxide, o^ when the surface of the core has such a composition,  y can in particular correspond to a carboxylic,  dicarDOXyiiC/  phosphonic, diphosphonic,  sulfonic or hydroxamic acid, which acids can be in deprotonated form, as described in the prior art and in particular in the international application WO 2004/097871.<br>
53<br>
1 JUN 2009<br><br>
According to the invention, it is preferable for p to be equal to 1. A spacer group SG generally corresponds to a group that does not develop an interaction other than that of a steric, hydrophilic or hydrophobic nature,, or an affinity with the core of the NB or the organic host film to which the method is applied, and that does not react significantly with them (not detectably). Typically, the spacer can be a carbonated chain not comprising a heteroatom. It can, for example, be an aliphatic chain, i.e. an alkyl chain, preferably 1 to 22 and typically 6 to 16 carbon atoms, an aromatic chain, or a heterocyclic chain, such as a polyether chain.<br>
According to a first modality, it is possible to apply the method to a support coated with a f unctionalized organic film so that it has an organic group BG2 having an affinity for the core of the NB. Thus, according to the specific embodiment, BG2 can be chosen from the groups listed above for Y and the NBs will have a composition, at least on their surface, as listed above in accordance with Y.<br>
According to a second modality, it is possible to apply the method to a support coated with a functionalized organic film so that it has an organic group BG3 having an affinity for the BGi group present on the stabilizer or the coating of the NB core. BGi and BG3 then form a pair having an electronic-type interaction, which will typically be the site of the affinity between the organic film and the functionalized NBs.<br>
According to a third modality, it is possible to apply the method to a support coated with a functionalized organic film so that it has both an organic group BG3 and a BG2 group. This embodiment is<br>
54<br><br><br>
suitable when the NB comprises a coating or a stabilizer comprising BGi-type groups and when the surface of its core also comprises this type of group. The chemical functions present at the surface of the core, although they are both capable of developing an interaction with the host film, can of course be different.<br>
As an organic host film, functionalized by BG2 and/or BG3 groups, and as a coating film, functionalized by a BGi group for the NB core, it is advantageous to use a film prepared according to the method described above on the basis of a primer and a monomer different from the adhesion primer and radically polymerizable. It is recommended to use functionalisable films as defined above. Typically BG2 and BG3 can correspond to a CFG of the film. The presence of a monomer often easily derivatizable or having particular organic functions is suitable. As specified above, it is possible to modify the CFGs of the film in order to obtain other CFGs. In this context, it is especially recommended to use vinyl monomers and in particular vinyl monomers of general formula (II), and particularly those for which Ri is a carboxylic acid, an amine, a carbonated group having these functions, typically with the other substituents R2 to R4 being H. This will particularly involve acrylic acid. Of course, in the synthesis of the organic film, it can comprise a precursor of the BGi, BG2 or BG3 group. Such a precursor can be transformed, when the user so decides, into a corresponding affinity group by performing a few, typically one or two, simple chemical steps. Thus, for example, it is possible to easily convert the carboxylic acid functions of a film developed<br>
55<br>
11JUN 2009<br><br>
from.acrylic acid into a carboxylate function by a simple acid-base reaction.<br>
In addition, as an organic host film, it is of course possible to use a film functionalized by a graft. According to this modality, it is desirable to use a graft having a chelation property. In this case, the BG2 and/or BG3 group advantageously corresponds to a GI as defined above, with such a GI being a chelating or complexing structure. The graft can be grafted according to the modalities presented above. It is in particular possible for it to also comprise a linking group LG as defined.<br>
Thus, for example, it is possible to use films comprising molecules derived from cyclodextrins, porphyrins or calixarenes. Thus, molecules or salts, for example lead, such as lead nitrate, can be chelated or complexed.<br>
Typically, Y will develop a weaker interaction with the core of the NB than the interaction that the surface of the core may develop with the host film of the support. Thus, the interaction that may exist between the core of a complex NB and Y will advantageously be less strong than that which may exist between the core of such a NB and BG2-<br>
In the sense of the invention, the suspension solvent is a solvent that enables the formation of a suspension of NBs. Such solvents typically correspond to the solvents in which the NBs are prepared because they prevent or slow the aggregation of NBs. The suspension solvent will advantageously be chosen from the swelling solvents, as defined above.<br><br><br>
The suspension of NBs will preferably be homogenized before being used.  It  is  possible,  for  example,  to subject   the   suspension  to  mechanical  agitation, preferably vigorous, or to an ultrasound treatment.<br>
The NB  concentration  in the  suspension and the duration of contact of the film with the suspension are variable and can be adjusted according to the amount of NB  that  the  user  wants  to  integrate  in  the  film. Preliminary tests  according to  the  affinity existing between the film and the NBs make it possible to easily determine  the  reasonable  procedure  conditions  for implementing the method. The user may find it useful to refer to the examples. rt is clear that the increase in the concentration of the suspension makes it possible to reduce the time necessary for integrating a given amount of NBs into the film.  Similarly,  the increase in the duration of contact makes it possible to integrate a larger amount of NBs for a given time. Thus, for example, for a film of 200 to 300 nm, contact with a suspension of NPs of Pt for 15 to 60 min makes it possible to obtain a film  comprising  nanoparticles.  As  a  solvent,  it  is possible, for example, when the filift comprises carboxyl-type affinity groups, to use, as th§ suspension solvent, a hydrophilic solvent such as water or a low-molecular-weight alcohol such as methanol or ethanol, or a mixture thereof. The choice of a hydrophilic solvent makes it possible, for example, to produce a suspension of NPs of silica,  gold or platinum stabilized by a  stabilizer comprising a hydrophilic group, such as ammonium. In such suspension solvents,  it is also possible to use NBs comprising hydrophilic groups at their surface such as<br>
57<br><br>
silica NPs. It may be useful for a person skilled in the art to refer to the examples.<br>
The invention also makes it possible to produce supports coated with films comprising one or more coalescence zones on the basis of supports coated with organic films comprising NBs, which films can be obtained by the method presented above. Thus, advantageously, the method for incorporating NBs will be applied to NBs capable of coalescing under the action of a coalescence agent, and will comprise an additional step of exposing a zone of the surface of the support, coated with the organic film comprising the NBs, to a coalescence agent. The coalescence of NBs is generally defined as the disappearance of the boundary between two NBs in contact with one another, or between an NB and an object of larger size and similar composition, followed by a change in shape leading to a reduction in the total surface of the system.<br>
The method is generally performed by placing the film comprising the NBs, typically obtained according to the method described above, in the presence of the coalescence agent. The method can of course be performed on one or more zones of the support comprising the film by exposing said zone to the coalescence agent. This method can thus be performed in a localized manner. The coalescence agent can lead to a modification of the support and any organic films and layers present on the support. A localized application of the agent can thus be preferable.<br>
The NBs capable of undergoing coalescence are, for example, simple NBs. These will generally be metallic NBs and in particular metal or metal alloy NCs or NPs, or<br>
58<br><br><br>
complex NBs such as functionalized NBs having a metallic core.<br>
The coalescence agent can be a variation of a physical parameter or irradiation. When the method is applied to a particular zone of the support, the parameter will be modified only in this zone. The physical parameters capable of being modified in order to obtain a coalescence of NBs are known to a person skilled in the art. Thus, for example, a modification of the temperature or photon or electron irradiation can be used Generally, a heat treatment at a temperature between 250 and 500°C, and for example 250 to 350°C for 2 to 5 min makes it possible to obtain the coalescence of platinum nanoparticles. Such a treatment performed on the entire surface of the support having a film comprising nanoparticles leads to the formation of a homogeneous metallic film. Tests can be performed to determine the minimum temperature for a given time according to the NBs and in particular according to their size as well as their composition. Similarly, the localized application of a coherent infrared source, such as a C02~type laser, easily leads to localized coalescence zones. The application of an electron beam, for example, using a microscope, makes it possible to produce a localized coalescence of NPs.<br>
This invention also relates to a non-electrically conductive solid support on which an organic film, comprising NBs, and particularly NPs, is grafted, of which the first unit covalently bound to said non-electrically conductive support is a derivative of an adhesion primer. The non-electrically conductive solid support according to this invention can optionally have a<br>
59	<br><br>
mask as defined above. It can also comprise molecules grafted according to the modalities described above.<br>
Advantageously, the organic film comprising NBs, and particularly NPs, includes, in addition to the first unit covalently bound to the non-electrically conductive support derived from an adhesion primer, identical or different monomers, bound to one another by a radical reaction and optionally derivatives of the adhesion primer. Thus, as explained above, the organic film is essentially a polymer film. More specifically, it can be in the form of a sequenced polymer or a statistical copolymer film. The non-electrically conductive solid supports, the adhesion primers and the monomers are as defined above. Typically, the NBs, and particularly the NPs, will be present in the outermost layers of the film.<br>
In addition, it is possible to use electrodeposition<br>
solutions to form a metallic coating, and in particular<br>
copper, on a support coated with an organic film obtained<br>
by the method described above. The electrodeposition will<br>
generally be performed on organic films not comprising<br>
NBs. Typically, to implement such provisions, a person<br>
skilled in the art may find it useful to refer to the<br>
international   application   WO 2007/034116   and	in<br>
particular the examples. Thus, the method of electrodeposition on a support coated with an organic film, capable of being obtained by the method described above, can in particular be performed by carrying out the following steps:<br>
a so-called "cold' inlet" step, in which the surface of the support is placed in contact, without electric polarization, with an electrodeposition bath, and preferably kept in this state for a period of at<br>
60<br><br>
least 5 seconds, preferably between 10 and 60 seconds, and advantageously around 10 to 30 seconds,<br>
-	a step of forming the metallic coating, in which<br>
said surface is polarized for a sufficient time to form<br>
said coating,<br>
-	a so-called "hot outlet" step, in which said<br>
surface is separated from the electrodeposition step<br>
while it is still under electric polarization.<br>
This invention also relates to a method for metalizing an organic film prepared at the surface of a solid support including steps consisting in:<br>
(a') preparing, at the surface of a solid support, an organic film comprising nano-objects (NBs) according to a method as defined above;<br>
(b' ' ) placing the film prepared in step (a' ' ) in contact with a solution containing at least one metal salt capable of being reduced by said NBs.<br>
Indeed, to form a metal coating on a support coated with an organic film obtained by the method described above, it is also possible to take advantage of the presence of NBs, and in particular NPs, in the organic film. For this, it is possible to use a solution comprising one or more metal salts capable of being reduced by the NBs present in the organic film. In general, the support coated with an organic film comprising NBs will be immersed directly in a solution comprising one or more metal salts. The time of exposure of the support coated with the organic film comprising NBs to the metal salt solution is generally between 30 seconds and around ten minutes. The concentration of NBs and metal salts in the film can be adapted according to the desired thickness of the film.<br>
61<br><br>
As an NB, it is possible to use,  in particular, simple NBs, generally metal NBs and in particular metal NCs or NPs such as platinum or palladium, or metal alloys, or complex NBs such as functionalized NBs having a metal core.<br>
Among the metal salt solutions, it is, for example, possible to choose copper sulfate or nickel sulfate solutions.<br>
The choice of the type of NB and the type of solution is closely linked to the reduction reaction that takes place.<br>
This invention also relates to the use of a solution containing at least one solvent, at least one adhesion primer, optionally at least one monomer different from the adhesion primer and, possibly, at least one chemical initiator as defined above, to form, under non-electrochemical conditions allowing for the formation of at least one radical on the adhesion primer, an organic film at the surface of a solid support in contact with said solution.<br>
The invention also relates to a kit for preparing a polymeric organic film at the surface of a sample. Such a kit includes, in particular:<br>
in a first compartment, a solution containing at least one adhesion primer as defined above,<br>
optionally, in a second compartment, a solution containing at least one radically polymerizable monomer different from the adhesion primer as defined above,<br>
and, possibly, in a third compartment, a solution containing at least one chemical polymerization initiator as defined above.<br>
62 _<br><br>
The kit according to this invention can optionally also contain a compartment containing a suspension of at least one nano-object in a suspension solvent and/or a compartment containing a functionalisation solution.<br>
In an alternative of the kit according to the invention, the first compartment contains at least one precursor of an adhesion primer. A "precursor of an adhesion primer", means a molecular entity separated from the adhesion primer by a single process step that is easy to implement. In this case, the kit will possibly include at least one other compartment containing at least one element necessary for developing the primer from its precursor (third compartment or fourth compartment if a chemical primer is present) . Thus, the kit can, for example, contain a solution of an arylamine, precursor of the adhesion primer, and also a NaN02 solution to allow, by addition, the formation of an aryl diazonium salt, the latter being an adhesion primer. A person skilled in the art will understand that the use of a precursor makes it possible to avoid storing or transporting reactive chemical species.<br>
The solvent can be contained in any one of the solutions of the first and second compartments, and possibly in the solution of the third or the fourth compartment. An identical or different solvent is advantageously contained in each of the solutions of the first and second compartments, and possibly in the solution of the third or the fourth compartment.<br>
The solutions of the various compartments can of course contain various other identical or different agents, such as stabilizing agents or surfactants. The use of the kit is simple, since it is simply necessary to<br>
63<br><br><br>
place the sample, of which the surface is to be treated, in contact with the mixture of the solutions prepared extemporaneously by mixing the solutions of the different compartments, preferably by agitation and in particular by ultrasound. Advantageously, only the solution containing the monomer, i.e. of the second compartment, is subjected to ultrasound before being mixed with the solution containing the adhesion primer prepared extemporaneously from a precursor, or present in the solution of the first compartment.<br>
The invention also makes it possible to obtain polymer films having remarkable properties. It should first be noted that the films have a particularly good resistance since, after a step of washing with a solvent in which the monomer is particularly soluble and in the presence of ultrasound, the thickness of the film does not vary significantly. Moreover, it is possible to test, with remarkable success, the thickness of the film obtained by varying the experimental parameters such as the reaction time or the active species concentration. The composition of the films is also homogeneous, and it is possible to test it with great precision, which makes it possible to produce both random and sequential polymer films (also called block or alternate). The films are uniform, i.e. they have a homogenous surface over the entire surface on which the method has been applied. This invention therefore makes it possible to produce numerous functionalizations on a very wide variety of surfaces with different monomers that may be combined with one another.<br>
It is of course possible to apply all of the methods described using a base support. The order and sequence of<br>
   64 <br><br>
the various methods, as well as the application of certain modalities offered by this invention, such as the use of masks and the localized formation of coalescence zones, result in supports coated with films capable of having a complexity, such as a lamination of successive organic and inorganic films, unequalled by such a simple methodology on such a low scale.<br>
The invention has numerous advantages. This method makes it possible, using a single, simple and reproducible process, to carry out the grafting of conductive or non-conductive surfaces. The implementation of this method does not require any significant investment with regard to specific equipment such as potentiostats, costly vacuum set-ups, and so on. Moreover, the implementation of the method is simple and fast by comparison with the other techniques known today for grafting or coating surfaces. This method does not require a connection to an electric circuit, unlike electrochemistry, and thus enables it to be applied on surfaces that are difficult to connect, such as nano objects. Furthermore, this radical polymerization can be performed in the presence of oxygen, and does not involve any special precautions during the synthesis.<br>
As shown diagrammatically in figure 8, this invention can be used in an aqueous medium without any equipment other than a container in which the reaction takes place. Therefore, it is no longer necessary to connect the surface to be grafted to a potentiostat (figure 8a), but only to soak it in the solution of the reaction medium (figure 8b). This technique makes it possible to synthesize a large number of polymers, the monomers of which may or may not be soluble in an  aqueous<br>
65<br><br><br>
medium, on a very wide variety of electrically- or non-electrically-conductive surfaces with very strong cohesion, with the films obtained being resistant to ultrasound in various solvents.<br>
The invention thus makes it possible to very effectively coat and functionalize a considerable number of surfaces of various types, heretofore not decorated or grafted, such as a PTFE surface. There are numerous fields of application and such a method can be applied, for example, in biology, in particular for biocompatibility processes (stents coating), for the functionalisation and in particular the protection of surfaces, such as metals (anticorrosion) or fibers (water-repellent), for effluent treatments by coating films with complexing molecules, or for producing a structural bond from the grafted film.<br>
In addition, the functionalisation can be localized by using the mask. It is thus possible to specifically coat various areas of the same surface while protecting other areas with one or more masks. This type of procedure is easy to implement because organic masks that are easy to remove can be used. In particular, it is possible to use simple depositions using ink-impregnated felt pens or a coating with fat.<br>
Finally, the functionalisation of the surfaces of interest can be further enhanced by the use of grafts themselves linked onto the grafted film.<br>
The method according to the invention can also be implemented in a pollution-free approach, since it can be performed in an aqueous medium and it produces little waste, with one of the products of the reaction capable of being in particular dinitrogen.<br>

Detailed description of specific embodiments<br>
The following examples were performed in a glass cell. Unless otherwise indicated, they were conducted under normal conditions of temperature and pressure (around 25 °C under around 1 atm) in ambient air. Unless otherwise indicated, the reagents used were obtained directly   on   the   market   without   any   additional<br><br><br>
purification- The glass plates used had a surface of 1 cm2.<br>
No precaution was taken with regard to the composition ot tne atw^spter^, and tne solutions Me^e not degassed. When the reaction time is not specified, the exposure of the surface to be treated with the reagent solution lasted for 1 to 15 minutes.<br>
Four series of examples illustrate the embodiments of the invention. The first concerns films prepared with an adhesion primer, the second concerns films prepared with an adhesion primer and a monomer, the third concerns functionalisable films, and the fourth concerns films comprising nano-objects.<br>
I - Adhesion primer alone<br>
Example 1-1 ~ Preparation of a film on a gold plate using a diazonium salt from para-benzylamine, prepared in situ in the presence of iron filings<br>
4 ml of a solution of NaN02 at 0.1 M in water were added to 4 ml of a solution of para-benzylamine at 0.1 M in HC1 (0.5 M) , in order to form the diazonium salt. A gold plate was then added to the reaction medium for 15 min. The plate was then rinsed in water with acetone, and subjected to ultrasound in DMF and then a basic soda solution with a pH = 9.5 so as to deprotonate the primary amine, before being dried.<br>
The XPS spectrometry (X photoelectron spectroscopy) and IR analyses confirm the presence of the film expected, of which the thickness increases with the reaction time. The  specific  poly-benzylamine  bands  at  1476  cm-1 (Deformation C=C), 1582 cm"1 (Deformation N-H) and 3362<br><br><br>
cm l (Elongation N-H) are visible on the IR spectrum of a plate after the treatment (figure 1) .<br>
Example 1-2 - Preparation of a film on a gold plate using a diazonium salt from p-phenyldiamine, prepared in situ in the presence of iron filings<br>
4 ml of a solution of NaN02 at 0.1 M in water were added to 4 ml of a solution of p-phenyldiamine at 0.1 M in HC1 (0.5 M) , in order to form the diazonium salt. 200 mg of iron filings were added to this diazonium salt solution. A gold plate was then added to the reaction medium for 15 min. The plate was then rinsed in water with acetone, and subjected to ultrasound in DMF and then rinsed in water before being dried.<br>
The XPS spectrometry {X photoelectron spectroscopy) and IR analyses confirm the presence of the film expected, of which the thickness increases with the reaction time. The specific p-phenylamine bands at 1514 cnf1 (Deformation C=C), 1619 cm"1 (Deformation N-H) and 3373 cm"1 {Elongation N-H) are visible on the IR spectrum of a plate after the treatment (figure 2).<br>
Example 1-3 - Test of the film thickness<br>
To show the influence of various parameters on the thickness of the organic film, the method was applied to a gold plate, placed in the presence of a solution containing 4-aminobenzyldiazonium, under non-electrochemical conditions allowing for the formation of radical entities. This choice was in particular motivated by the presence of characteristic absorption bands of the film obtained at 1504 cm-1 (Deformation C=C) , 1605 cm"1 (Deformation N-H) and 1656 cm"1 (Elongation N-H).<br><br><br>
A solution of diazonium salt in water was prepared by adding 4 ml of a solution of NaN02 at 0.1 M (4.10-4 moles) to 4 ml of a solution at 0.1 M (4.10-4 moles) of p-4-aminobenzylamine in HCl (0.5 M) , under agitation. A gold plate was added to this solution.<br>
To study the influence of the reaction time, the solution was then placed under non-electrochemical conditions allowing for the formation of radicals on the adhesion primer by adding 200 mg of iron filings. The plate was then removed from the reaction medium and immediately rinsed with water then acetone and dimethylformamide (DMF) under ultrasound, and finally dried under an argon current.<br>
As shown by the IR spectrum in figure 3, the time of exposure of the sample to the reaction medium has an influence on the thickness of the film obtained. Exposure times of 5, 10 and 15 minutes were tested. It appears that a prolonged exposure increases the thickness of the film. Indeed, the increase in the intensity of the absorption bands of the poly-p-4-aminobenzylamine at 1504 cm'1, 1605 cm-1 and 1656 cm-1 indicates an increase in the thickness of the film over time.<br>
Example 1-4 - Preparation of a film on a gold plate using commercial p-nitrophenyldiazonium in the presence of iron filings<br>
The experiment was conducted according to the protocol described in example I~2, using commercial p-<br>
nitrophenyldiazonium (Aldrich®) solubilised at 0.05 M in an HCl solution (0.5 M). The gold plate was then immersed in the solution for around 15 min. The plate was then<br><br><br>
rinsed with water and acetone, and subjected to ultrasound in DMF and then in water before being dried.<br>
As above, the XPS spectrometry (X photoelectron spectroscopy) and IR analyses confirmed the presence of the film expected, of which the thickness increases with the reaction time.<br>

The procedure is identical to that of example 1-1. The iron filings were replaced by around 5.10 mg of steel wool fibers {supplier CASTORAMA®) , successively fine (0), extra fine  (00)  and super fine  (000) ,  which makes it possible not to have solid iron residue in the solution.<br>
The XPS and IR analyses confirm the presence of the film expected, of which the thickness increases with the reaction time.<br>
Example 1-6 - Preparation of a film on a gold plate using a diazonium salt created in  situ  in a basic medium<br>
The procedure is identical to that of example 1-1. 0.3 ml of a soda solution at 2.5 x 10~3 M were substituted for the iron filings in order to allow for a slight increase in the pH to above 4.<br>

The protocol is identical to that of example 1-1. An irradiated PVDF membrane (2 cm2, thickness 9 urn, electron irradiation dose; 100 kGy) was substituted for iron filings.<br>
The IR analyses confirmed the presence of the expected film, the thickness of which increased with the reaction time.<br>

a gold plate, placed in the presence of a solution containing an adhesion primer, 4-aminophenyldiazonium, and a monomer, HEMA, under non-electrochemical conditions allowing for the formation of a radical entity based on the adhesion primer. This choice was motivated in particular by the presence of characteristic absorption bands at 1726, 1454 and 1166 nrn of the poly-HEMA.<br>
A solution of adhesion primer in water was prepared by adding 4 ml of a solution of NaN02 at 0.1 M (4. 10~4 moles) to 4 ml of a solution at 0.1 M (4.10-4 moles) of p-phenylenediamine in HC1 {0.5 M), under agitation. 1 ml (8.24 mmoles) of HEMA and a gold plate were added to this solution.<br>

The solution was then placed under non-electrochemical conditions allowing for the formation of radicals on the adhesion primer by adding 200 mg of iron filings. The plate was then removed from the reaction medium and immediately rinsed with water then acetone and dimethylformamide (DMF) under ultrasound, and finally dried under an argon current.<br>
As shown by the IR spectrum in figure 10a, the time of exposure of the sample to the reaction medium has an influence on the thickness of the film obtained. Indeed, the increase in the intensity of the absorption bands of the HEMA at 1726, 1454 and 1166 nm indicates an increase in the thickness of the film over time.<br>
The thickness of the films was measured using a prof ilometer: it ranged from 12 nm to 200 nm for an exposure time ranging from 1 to 15 minutes.<br>

2-2 Influence of non-electrochemical conditions allowing for the formation of radicals on the adhesion primer<br>
Given that the amount of radicals present in the solution has a notable influence on the reaction, the method was carried out with a variable amount of iron filings for a reaction time set at 10 min.<br>
As shown by the IR spectrum in figure 10b, the amount of iron filings present in the reaction medium has an influence on the thickness of the film obtained. A minimum amount of filings is necessary in order to generate enough radicals in the reaction medium and make it possible to obtain a grafted film of an IR-detectable thickness. Beyond a certain maximum amount of filings, the variations in thickness of the film obtained are negligible.<br>
Example II-3 - Preparation of a film on a gold plate using commercial p-nitrophenyldiazonium and HEMA in the presence of iron filings<br>
The experiment was conducted according to the protocol described in example II-2, using commercial p-nitrophenyldiazonium (Aldrich®) solubilised at 0.05 M in an HC1 solution (0.5 M). The gold plate was then immersed in the solution for around 15 min. The plate was then rinsed with water and acetone, and subjected to ultrasound in DMF and then in water before being dried.<br>

Example 11-14 - Preparation of a film on a glass plate using a diazonium salt prepared in situ and butylmethacrylate in the presence of iron filings<br>
200 mg of iron filings, then a dispersion of 1 ml of butylmethacrylate (BUMA) in 10 ml of water prepared by ultrasound were added to a diazonium salt solution prepared according to example II-2 and containing a glass plate that has been pre-cleaned by a "piranha" solution treatment (i.e. a mixture of 60/40 by volume of concentrated sulfuric acid and water oxygenated at 110 volumes). After a reaction time of 10 minutes, the plate is then cleaned and dried according to the procedures described above.<br>
A spot test was then performed on the glass plate thus coated (figure 19b) and on a pristine glass plate used as a control (figure 19a). A change in the physical property of the glass plate thus coated, which becomes water-repellent, can be observed by the variation in the surface angle between the drop and the surface.<br>
Example 11-15 - Preparation of a film on a gold plate having a commercial ink mask based on a diazonium salt prepared in situ and hydroxyethylmethacrylate (HEMA) or acrylic acid (AA) in the presence of iron fillings<br>
The protocol used is identical to that of example II-2 for HEMA and 5 for AA. Prior to its introduction to the reaction medium, the plate was coated with a mask: different patterns were produced on the gold plate using a black-colored ink felt pen (Staedtler®-lumocolor®) .<br>
85<br><br>
After reaction, the plate was washed with water, DMF and acetone in order to remove the reaction products, then washed more vigorously with ultrasound with the same solvents. The surface was then rinsed again with acetone, then dried before being analyzed by Infrared spectroscopy (IR) (C=0 bands for each of the polymers) and by Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM).<br>
The different mappings (IR/AFM) obtained are shown in figure 20. Figure 20a shows the presence of a cross-shaped pattern and figure 20b shows another pattern, which are not covered by the organic film (it is a transmittance measurement, also, the areas in relief correspond to non-grafted areas).<br>

Prior to its introduction into the reaction medium, the plate is covered with a thiol mask using a PDMS (polydimethylsiloxane) buffer having micrometric patterns and previously impregnated with a long-chain (C18) ethanolic thiol solution. The plate was treated after evaporation of the ethanol.<br>
After the treatment, the plate was cleaned and analyzed as in example 11-15.<br>
The AFM mapping is shown in figure 22a, which shows that the grafted surface corresponds to the reverse of the triangular micrometric patterns appearing on the buffer and in figure 22b, which shows micrometric patterns corresponding to lines (a transmittance measurement, also, the areas in relief correspond to the non-grafted areas).<br>

Per-(3,6)-anhydro-p-cyclodextrine (PaCD) (M = 1008 g/mol) was first prepared according to the protocol described in Gadelle, A.; Defaye, J. Angew. Chem., Int. Ed. Engl. 1991, 30, 18. The carboxylic acid function of PaCD (10 mg) was then activated by forming an activated ester using N,N'-diisopropylcarbodiimide (DIC) (6 eq.) in DMF (5 ml) under agitation for 6 hours in the presence of catalytic amounts (0,05 eq.) of dimethyl amino pyridine (DMAP).<br>
A gold plate with a surface of 2 cm2 coated with a film, around 10 nm in thickness, comprising poly(2-hydroxyethyl)methacrylate (PHEMA) and produced according to the modalities of example II-3, was placed in a closed test tube containing 6 ml of DMF as well as the activated PaCD.<br>

After 24 hours, methanol (5 ml) is added to the reaction medium, then the solution is evaporated and the solid obtained is solubilised in water (0.5 ml) before being precipitated in acetone (300 ml). After filtration, the beige solid obtained is filtered on a Biichner funnel and dried. A mixture of propanol spacer PaCDs in various degrees, from 4 to 14 propanols, is obtained.<br>
A gold plate with a surface of 2 cm2 with a PAA film of around 100 nm, prepared according to the modalities of example II-2 from acrylic acid, was placed in a test tube containing the mixture of propanol spacer PaCDs (10 mg) solubilised in DMF (6 ml).<br>
