An object, of the present invention is to propose a process tor preparation of structural adhesive for joining particularly rubber to rubber and rubber to metal.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to propose a process for preparation of structural adhesive which is capable of adliesing rubber to rubber, rubber to metal by cold method without application of any external heat.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to propose a process for preparation of structural adhesive which has higher adhesive strength<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to propose a process for preparation of structural adhesive which is not brittle.<br>
Further object of the present invention is to propose a process for preparation of structural adhesive which has excellent weather resistance including marine environment.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to this invention there is provided an improved adhesive comprising of two components -component A and component B, in equal proportions wherein:<br>
(a)	component A comprises 5 to 50% by w/w of rubber such as herein described and 2-50% of aromatic amine such as herein described in 65-85% of ethyl acetate, and<br>
(b)	component B comprises 20-40% w/w of an epoxy resin or blend of two epoxy resins in 60-80% w/w of ethyl acetate, and a metal oxide selected from ZnO, MgO, Fe2O3.<br>
The proposed adhesive composition is a two component system. The component A materials contain rubber, crosslinker for epoxy resin and ethyl acetate. The component B materials contain epoxy resin in ethyl acetate. The crosslinker for epoxy resin is an aromatic diamine. The rubber used is a carboxylated nitryl rubber. The epoxy resin is a blend of two grades of resins available commercially from (Ciba Gaigy) Ly556 and Gy280.<br>
DBSCRITPION OF INVENTION<br>
According to this invention there is provided a structural adhesive comprising of two components-component A and component B, in equal proportions wherein:<br>
(a)	component A  comprises  rubber  and  aromatic  amine  in  ethyl acetate, and<br>
(b)	component B comprises an epoxy resin or blend of two resins in ethyl acetate, and a metal oxide.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, the structural adhesive comprises of two components, the component 'A' and component 'B' The process for preparation of each of these components and finally preparation of the adhesive therefrom, comprises of the following steps:<br>
(a)       Preparation  of   Component   'A'  of   Adhesive;<br>
The	component	A'	comprises	of	carboxylated<br>
nitrile	rubber,      cross—linker      for   epoxy      resin      and     ethyl<br>
acetate.        For     preparation   of   this   component,   5     to     5(37.     by<br>
wt/wt preferably 10-20 by wt/wt of carboxylated nitrile rubber      and   2   to   50"/.,    preferably   5—15%  of   an      aromatic      amine<br>
preferably m—phenylene diamine (required for curing epoxy resin   in   component   'B')   are  dissolved   in   ethyl   acetate,   under<br>
stirring      by   employing   a   high   speed   mechanical   stirrer.	The<br>
stirring   is  continued   for   about   8—10   hours  until      dissolution<br>
is complete. The component is stored in a dark glass bottle or   is   stored   in   a   sealed   tin   container.<br>
*	b)        Preparation   of  Component   'B'   of  Adhesive;<br>
Component 'B' of adhesive of the present invention contains<br>
epoxy      resin      in      ethyl   acetate.	For      preparation      of      this<br>
component, preferably the percentage of epoxy resin in ethyl<br>
acetate      is   20   to   90%,   more   preferably   60-80%   by   wt/wt.	The<br>
epoxy resin may be liquid or low melting point solids but preferably      liquids   having   a   bulk   viscosity   from   100     cps      to<br>
about	2,000,000	centipoises	and	more     preferably<br>
from	5000	to        50,000	centipoises	(measured        using a	Haake	ro to viscometer	at	25   C).	The        epoxy  resin      can      have     equivalent	weight	from      1000      to        2000,<br>
more preferably from 100 to 500. The epoxy resin preferably taken is based on diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A. In addition, stoichio-metric amount of metal oxide with respect to carboxyl content of carboxyl Nitrile rubber (XNBR) present in component A. The metal oxide taken is like ZnO, MgO. Fe203 but preferably ZnO is added to the component B The component B is also stored in a sealed tin container or dark glass bottle.<br>
(c)     Preparation of Adhesive:<br>
The adhesive is prepared by mixing component A and component B in the ratio of 1:1.<br>
The present invention will now be more clearly understood from the example which follows. The example is not intended to be restrictive and is merely illustrative of the scope of the present invention.<br>
Preparation Of Pretreatment Solution:<br>
This solution is required only for rubber surface. This is a solution of dichloramine (N N' dichloro p-chloro benzene sulfonamide) in a solvent). The solvent for this solution is prepared by mixing 6 ml of distilled water in 100 ml of acetone. The pretreatment solution is prepared by dissolving about 14g of the above dichloramine in 100 ml of solvent. The above solution is prepared prior to application of adhesive.<br>
• WORKING EXAMPLE<br>
Component A is prepared by mixing 11 gm of carboxylated nitrile rubber and 11 gm of m-phenylamine dissolved in 78 gm of ethyl acetate All the ingredients are mixed thoroughly by employing a high speed mixer. Component B is prepared by dissolving diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A m ethyl acetate taking 80g of resin in 20g of ethyl acetate. A blend of two grades of epoxy resin namely Gy280 (equivalent wt 245 to 255) and Gy 250 (equivalent weight 182 to 192) is taken. All the components are mixed thoroughly by employing a high speed mixer. The component A and B were mixed together taking equal quantities of component 'A' and component 'B’.<br>
Application of Adhesive:<br>
The adhesive is applied onto the modified rubber surface and metal surface in three coats at a temperature of 23±5°C and relative hiniidity not exceeding 70%. The drying time of the first layer is 35±5 min, second layer is 25±5 min and third layer is 3±1 min. Afterwards the glued surfaces are stuck to each other without slipping. The specimens are rolled with the help of a roller weighing 500g at least ten times in each direction. The specimens are left for curing at room temperature for 72 hours.<br>
Adhesion Test of the Adhesive:<br>
The adhesion test is done by applying the adhesive onto rubber to rubber specimen and rubber to etal specimen (180x25x4mm3 ) The method of application is as per the procedure given above. After complete curing, the specimen was tested for 180° -peel strength.<br>
