This invention relates to a process for the synthesis of polyarylene ether ketone resins.<br>
ether<br>
Polyarylene Jketone resins have gained rapid accetpance for use in advanced thermoplastic resin composites for aerospace structural applications and for storing cryofluids at low temperatures. These polymers exhibit excel lent acid and alkali resistance and show very good dimentional stability. They are thermally stable and have melt. processabi1 ity .<br>
ether<br>
Polyarylene / ketones are polymers having a molecular chain consisting of phenylene groups, oxygen atoms and ketone groups. Conventionally these resins are prepared in the presence of high boi1ing solvents like dipheny1 sulphone, N-cyclohexy1-2-pyrrolidone and sulpholane. A major draw back of the existing process is the high cost of the solvents and the inability of solvent recovery for future use.<br>
The main objectives of this invention ar&amp; in providing a process for the synthesis of polyarylene ether ketones using less expensive and easily recoverable solvents and to obtain polymers in good yield having an inherent viscosity 0.3 to 75 dL/g.<br>
4,4'-dinalobenzophenones   is  subjected   nucleophi1ic<br>
substitution  reaction  with   hydroquinone,  resorcinol,   4,4'-<br>
dihydroxybenzophenone  and bisphenol-A  using benzophenone as  an<br>
* inert solvent in the presence of anhydrous alkali carbonate.  The<br><br>
The dihalocompund may be difluoro, dichloro  and diiodo compounds or  these mixtures-  Alkali carbonates can be  sodium  carbonate, potassium  carbonate or   a mixture of these two-   The  proportion of  the carbonate is not relevant -  Initially, the  hydroquinone, resorcinol  or 4,4'-dihydroxy benzophenone or   bisphenol-A   added as one of the monomer reacts with the alkali carbonate to form  a salt.   This reaction is preferably carried out in a  hydrocarbon solvent  selected  from  benzene, toluene, xylene  or  a  mixture thereof  in  any  porportion.   The  nucleophilic  formation   of polyarylene  ketone  may  take  place  simultaneously  with   the formation  of alkaline salt of the respective dihydroxy  monomer. The monomer to benzophenone solvent ratio by weight may vary from 1:4 to 1:7 and the molar ratio of the dihydroxy monomer to alkali metal carbonate can vary from 1:1 to 1:3.  the ratio between  the monomer and the azotropic hydrocarbon solvent may be between  1:4 to  1:6-   Instead salt formation takes place  at  a  temperature between 110°C to 160°C and the polymerisation takes place between 160° to 240°C though these temperature ranges are not critical to the reaction.  The reaction may be complete from 2 to 7 hours.<br>
Polymerization takes place through the nucleophilie substitution of the halobenzophenone and the alkalimetal salt of the hydroquinone or resorcinol or 4,4'-dihydroxy benzophenone or bisphenol-A monomer resulting in the formation of arylene ether bond.  Alkali metal halide is the by product.<br><br><br><br>
A process for the synthesis of polyarylene ether ketone resin according to this invention comprises the steps of reacting dihalobenzenephenone wi th dihydroxy substituted aromatic compounds such as dihydroquinone, resorcinoi, bisphenol-A, 4,4'-dihydroxybenzophenone or mixtures thereof in the presence of at least one anhydrous aIkalicarbonate benzophenone and at least one hydrocarbon solvent, and recovering the product from the reaction mixture by known methods.<br>
This process for synthesis results in high molecular weight polymers in good yield. The solvent is recoverable for reuse. The temperature of the reaction is not very high. Further depending on the aromatic moities of the dihydroxymonomer , further chemical modi fieation of the ketone resin is possible.<br>
The following examples ^re only illustrative of the invented process.<br>
Example 1<br>
Synthesis of polyarylene ether etherketone (PEEK-I) from 4,4'-difluorobenzophenone and hydroquinone (1:1 mole ratio).<br>
A four necked reaction kettle fitted with a stirrer condenser, thermocouple, inlet and outlet for inert gas (outlet is through Dean-stark condenser and a calcium chloride guard tube) is charged with 5.04g (0.045 mole) of hydroquinone, 90g  of<br><br>
ben/opnenone, 7.59g (0.0549 mole) of anhydrous K2CO3 and 80 ml of Cjrll_M|  toluene.  The reaction mixture was slowly heated to  150°C and ^ater was removed by azeotropic disti1lation with toluene for a  period of 4 hours.  The reaction mixture was cooled  to  about l00nC,  and  10g (0.045 mole)  of  4,4'-difluorobenzophenone  was addc*d,   The poly condensation reaction was continued for 2 - 5h  at 165°C  and  2.5h  at 230°C.   The viscous  reaction  mixture  was cooled to room temperature.  The product was refluxed with  water repeatedly  and subjected to soxhlet extraction with acetone  for 16  hours  and  dried under vacuum at 100°C for  12h.  PEEK-I  is obtained  in  13.00g  (98*/.).  The structure of  the  product  was confirmed   by   infra-red   and   nuclear   magnetic   resonance spectroscopy.  The obtained polymer had eta inh = 0.75dL/g, Tg  -146°C  and Tm = 338°C.  TGA curve of PEEK-I recorded in  nitrogen atmosphere  shows  that  it is stable upto  520°C  and  undergoes degradation above this temperature leaving behind a char  residue of 50'/. at 900°C.<br>
Example 2<br>
Synthesis of polyarylene ether ether ketone (PEEK-II) from 4,4'-diehiorobenzophenone and hydroquinone (1:1 molar ratio).<br>
A four necked reaction kettle fitted with a stirrer condenser,  thermocouple, inlet and outlet for inert gas  (outlet<br><br>
is  through  Dean-stark condenser and a  calcium  chloride  guard tube) is charged with 5.04g (0.045 mole) of hydroquinone, 90g of benzophenone, 7 . 59g (0.0549 mole) of anhydrous K2C03 and 80 ml of dried  toluene.  The reaction mixture was slowly heated  to  150 C and water was removed by azeatropic disti11 ation with toluene for a  period of 4 hours.  The reaction mixture  was cooled to  about 100°C,  and 11.5g (0.045 mole) of  4,4'-difluorobenzophenone  was added.   The polyeondensation reaction was continued for 2 . 5h  at 165°C  and  2.5h  at 230°C.   The viscous  reaction  mixture  was cooled to room temperature.  The product was refluxed with  water repeatedly  and subjected to soxhlet extraction with acetone  for 16  hours  and dried under vacuum at 100°C for  12h.  PEEK-II  is obtained  in  12. 4g  (94*/.) .  The structure  of  the  product  was conf irmed   by   infra-red   and   nuclear   magnetic   resonance spectroscopy.  The obtained polymer had eta inh = 0.30dL/g, Tg  = 145°C and Tm = 335°C.  TGA curve of PEEK-II recorded in  nitrogen atmosphere  shows  that  it is stable upto  480°C  and  undergoes degradation above this temperature leaving behind a char  residue of 457. at 900°C.<br>
