CROSS REITDKENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
This application claims benefit of U.S. provisions] application number 60/357,584, filed February 15,2002, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Phagocytic white blood cells and antimicrobial agents have been recognized as having several potential interactions that may be synergistic for combating infection. Phagocytic killing by polymoiphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs), monocytes, and macrophages is the primary host defense against bacterial infections. Antimicrobial agents make bacteria more susceptible to killing by neutrophils even at subinhibitory concentrations (Adinolfi &amp; Bonventre (19S3) Antimicrob Ag&amp;its Chemother 32; 1012-8)- Neutrophils migrate to sites of infection, concentrate at these sites, and thus may serve as an antimicrobial agent delivery mechanism.<br>
Despite the effectiveness of this defense, Salmonella and other intracellular pathogens can invade phagocytes and survive inside them, avoiding the lysosomal compartment. Cellular invasion is an important step in the progression of many serious bacterial infections because it allows pathogens to evade host defense mechanisms and benefit from a rich nutrient supply-In order for neutrophils to function as an effective means of transporting antimicrobial agents to sites of infection, several criteria must be met: the agent should not interfere with neutrophil migration, the agent should be concentrated in the neutrophil, and the agent should be released in an active form at the site of infection. Cell-permeating antimicrobial agents can potentially play an important role in eliminating infections by intracellular pathogens. Unfortunately, many antibiotic classes do not penetrate the plasma membrane effectively (See, for example, Table 1). C-Jactam and cephalosporins, while representing one of the most prescribed antibiotics today, suffer from poor intracellular penetration and therefore have limited utility in the treatment of intracellular bacterial-pathogens. Therefore, the<br><br>
effectiveness of an antimicrobial agent in vivo depends not only on its activity but also on its ability to reach sites of infection.<br><br><br><br>
In general, successful therapy with a pharmaceutical agent requires that the agent satisfy numerous requirements imposed by the physiology of the host and of the disease or condition- These include: (i) adequate ability to interact with the target; (ii) appropriate physical properties for presence at the location of the receptors in concentrations that permit the interactions noted above; (iii) appropriate physical properties to allow the agent to enter the body and distribute to the location of the receptors by any means; (iv) Sufficient stability in fluids of the body; (v) the absence of toxic effects in compartments where the drug is most concentrated, or in any other compartment where the drug is located; and (vi) the absence of sequestration into non-physiological compartments and so on.<br>
In general, these compounding requirements limit the nature of pharmaceutical compounds that have utility in \nvo and thus reduce the probability of discovering adequately active molecules from de novo starling points.<br>
Current strategies for enhancing the intracellular accumulation of antibiotics include direct chemical modification of regions within the antibiotic, incorporation of antibiotics into liposomes, or the preparation of prodrugs. Recent improvements in the technology of synthetic chemistry and molecular biology have allowed the testing of large numbers of structural variants and the discovery of many ligands with adequate affinity to their targets to have some potential in vivo. Many such molecules prove inadequate on in vivo testing largely due to the manifold, stringent, and often conflicting (i.e., stability without toxicity) requirements outlined above.<br>
US Patent No. 5,434,147 describes a process fol conjugation of antibiotics with transferrin or low density lipoprotein for treating intracellular pathogens. The coupled transferrin molecules are claimed to be selectively taken up by phagosomes to target membrane-bound pathogens. However, transferrin, and therefore molecules attached to it, do not traffic through the lysosomal compartment. This process, therefore, is of limited utility in areas where the antibiotic is to provide synergistic activity with phagocytic immune cells in neutralising non-intracellulax pathogens. Furthermore, the molecular weight of transferrin (76,000-81,000 daltons), as well as its polypeptide composition, precludes oral deliver/ of such compositions- Oral absorption of drugs is the most desirable method of drug administration in die treatment of human diseases, particularly in prolonged therapeutical treatments.<br><br>
One class of antibiotics which have shown promise both in terras of accumulation in phagocytic white blood cells as well as in fighting intracellular infections has been macrolides. Certain members of the macrolide antibiotic family accumulate to a large degree m phagocytic cells, often" achieving a cellular-to-extracellular concentration ratio (C/E) of greater than 100- In particular, Azithromycin, an azalide antibiotic (Djokic et al, supra, Bright et al., supra; and US Patent No. 4,474,768) is more stable than erythromycin in the presence of acids, and has very low plasma concentrations owing to its concentration to a large extent in cells, often achieving a C/E of- 500 (Bouvier d^voire et al., supra). Its stability, accumulation in phagocytes and long half-life (tl/2 ~ 68 hours), make azithromycin an ideal antibiotic m terms of in vivo distribution.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
The invention relates to a conjugate useful for enhancing efficacy of a therapeutic agent, and a method of treating diseases including infection diseases (e.g., bacterial diseases).<br>
In one aspect, this invention features a compound of the following formula:<br><br>
therein T is a transportophoie, L is a bond or linker, C is an antibiotic therapeutic agent, and m is 1-8, the transportophore is covalently bonded to the antibiotic therapeutic agent via the bond or the linker, and the transportophore is an" azithromycin derivative or crown ether derivative. Note that when there are more than one L or C moieties (i.e., m is greater than 1), the L moieties or the C moieties, independently can be the same or different<br>
The transportophore can be a metabolite, a natural product, a metabolite rnimic, a metabolite derivative (e.g., a sugar, amino, or peptide derivative), a fatty acid, a bile acid, a vitamin, a nucleobase, an alcohol, or an organic acid or base, a portion of which resembles and is recognized as a substrate for transport protein(s). It can be an amphiphilic molecule having a pKa value of 6.5 to 9.5, or a cyclic or heterocyclic molecule (e.g., lactone, lactam, ethor, cyclic acetal or hemi-aceta[)_ The<br><br>
cyclic or heterocyclic molecule can have an attached sugar. The cyclic or heterocyclic molecule can be a macrolactone or macroether, including a macrolactone or macroether having an attached sugar. The cyclic, or heterocyclic molecule can also be a macrolide or ketolide having an ammo sugar, including a macrolide having mono-,<br>
i<br>
di-, or tri-basic groups (e.g., an amine). In some'embodiments, the macrolide has no intrinsic antibacterial activity (determined by, e.g., an antibiotic sensitivity test) at 10 uM in solution and a pKa value between 6-5 and 9.0<br>
In some embodiments, the transportopho're is an azithromycin derivative, and the conjugate has the formula (in which a bond, drawn without any attached groups,<br><br>

Jn some embodiments, the linker can be added in one or more positions via one or more linking groups of the same or differing formula. In a single embodiment providing for more than one position to be occupied by any molecule defined as above, there is no requirement for all linkers to be the same molecule. Indeed, in some embodiments, it will be desirable that more than one linker is linked to a transportophore and that the linkers be two different molecules as is exemplified in the examples (see, e.g., Example 1, Synthesis 2). The linker can be many other molecules that, to date, have not been classified as pharmacological agents and commercialised as such due to inadequate pharmacokinetic properties including one of more of those Jistedbelow.

A therapeutic agent may be released from a compound described above in response to the enzyme activity or the physicochemical Environment of the targeted cells. Thus, the therapeutic agent is selectively accumulated in a cell due to specific characteristics of the cell membranes, specific expression of membrane proteins, specific conditions within the cell, notably to expression of specific proteins such as granule proteins, binding sites in the cytoplasm, or other membrane bound or soluble proteins, and is thus trapped in the cell and therefore exhibits an enhanced or desired activity therein. An "amphiphilic molecule," as used herein, is a molecule having a hydrophilic (polar) and hydrophobic (non-polar) functional groups (e.g., atoms) or a combination of groups (or atoms). The pKa of this molecule is in the range of 6.5 to 9.5.<br>

The conjugate contains a transportophore and an antibiotic therapeutic agent, and in the cell, the transportophore is not covalently bonded to the therapeutic agent.<br>
This invention provides several advantages. For example, the present invention is a widely applicable, pharmacologically viable, method for making prodrugs and the products of this process which will allow the intracellular accumulation of antibiotic compounds. The invention involves the use of azithromycin-derived and crown ether-derived molecules as carriers to provide enhanced intracellular accumulation of antibiotics into phagocytic cells among other cell types. These carriers have been shown to exhibit remarkable accumulation in cells, especially in phagocytic cells. The present invention represents a significant advancement over conventional administration of antibiotics, as it permits the treatment of intracellular pathogens with a wider array of antibiotics than is currently feasible, and, when accumulated within certain cell types, it will have a synergistic effect with the phagocytic killing by polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs), monocytes, and macrophages. Antibiotics previously identified through high-throughput screens which are not in use because of sub-optimal pharmacokinetic behaviour may serve as a suitable drug in this invention, as the pharmacokinetic properties of the carrier is expected to supersede that of die drug.<br>
The broadened range of antibiotics which can be intracellularly accumulated using this invention facilitates the management of troublesome infections caused by pathogens resistant to a restricted set of antibiotics. Intracellular accumulation in the order of C/E - 100 also means that intracellular pathogens will receive a correspondingly higher dose of the antibiotic.<br>
Other advantages, objects, and features of the invention will be apparent from the description and from the claims.<br><br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
The present invention relates novel conjugates of antibiotics to carriers consisting of azithromycin-derived or crown ether-derived compounds, as.well as methods for synthesising such derivatives of antibiotics are disclosed. The carrier-conjugated antibiotics accumulate intraceUularly, especially in phagocytic cells. Upon internaJisation, the conjugates are capable of slowly hydrolysing to the original active drug molecule under physiological conditions, retaining the spectrum, efficacy and pharmacokinetic properties of the parental molecule. The composition is therefore especially effective against numerous bacterial pathogens.<br>
The conjugate described in the "Summary" section can be prepared by methods known in the art, as well as by the synthetic routes disclosed herein. For example, one can react a transportophore having a reactive moiety with a therapeutic agent having another reactive moiety. One of the two reactive moieties is a leaving group (e.g.,-CI, OR) and the omer is a derivatizable group (e.g., -OH, or-NH-). Then, the traiisportophore is covalefltly bonded to the therapeutic agent via a reaction between the wo reactive moieties. In the case when a linker is present, each of the two reactive moieties, independently, is a leaving group or a derivatizable group, and each reacts with its reactive counterpart in the linker to form a covalent bond. Detailed routes including various intermediates are illustrated in the examples herein.<br>
More specifically, a transportophore and a therapeutic agent can be directly connected or via a linking element. This element typically is a bifuBCtional molecule of low molecular mass, which can react subsequently with the transportophore and the therapeutic agent. Ideally the therapeutic agent can be released from this linker under physiological conditions. This may be achieved oxidatively (e.g^ by action of a cytochrome C), reductively (e.g., by action of NADH), hydrolytically (eg., by action of a protease), or initiated by radicals (e.g,, by the action of superoxide radicals). The mechanisms of therapeutic agent release are not limited to the above examples.<br>

Example 2: Oxazolidinone antimicrobials and derivatives thereof<br>
The present invention relates generally ,to the delivery of antibiotics to<br>
mammals for use in the treatment of bacterial pathogens. More particularly, the<br>
present invention involves the coupling of antibiotics to a macroh'de to form<br>
antibiou'c-macrolide conjugates which target pathogens. The present invention<br>
overcomes problems encountered by several classes of antibiotics which do not<br>
efficiently penetrate cells, for the treatment of,[among others, intracellular pathogens.<br>
i Macrolides were selected which have been shown to have high cumulative<br>
capacity in macrophages, but which have no anti-microbial activity. The proposed<br>
oxazolidinone structures are therefore enhanced in efficacy, particularly in the<br>
treatment of intracellular pathogens.<br><br>
Oxazolidinones are an appealing class of antimicrobials due to their unique bacteriostatic mechanism of action, lack of cross-resistance with other agents, good oral bioavailability, potential for structure modification, and broad spectrum of activity. Oxazolidinones with antibacterial activity are a novel class of antibiotics whose mode of action is to block protein synthesis, in particular by binding to the 50s ribosomal subunit, thereby blocking intiation of protein biosynthesis.<br>
In in vitro susceptibility studies, Bnezolid was shown to have activity against 3 wide variety of organisms, including graph-positive cocci, gram-negative anaerobes, and mycobacteria. With few exceptions, gram-negative bacteria are resistant due to efflux- LinezoIicL, the first new oxazolidinone class of antibiotics, is well distributed in the body when administered orally, with virtually complete bioavailability. Good (issue penetration is achieved, with high levels in the skin structure. Metabolism yields two primary derivatives, which may accumulate in those patients with renal insufficiency. There are no major toxicity problems which emerged during clinical trials.<br>
Partly owing to its synthetic nature and its new mechanism of action, there is an apparent lack of pre-existing resistant population. Mutational resistance has also been extremely difficult to select in staphylococci. Transferable Unezolid resistance has not yet been described. Direct radiometric distribution studies, as well as efficacy studies performed using intracellular pathogens such as Legionella suggest thai liaezolid achieves modest levels of intracellular penetration (DE ratio of ~1)7 thus perhaps limiting its utility in the treatment of intracellular pathogens. I. Coupling of l,7-I&gt;iaza-15-crown-5 with oxazolidinones:<br><br><br>
2 gofl,7-Dia3a-15-crown-5 are treated with 1.15 gofdimethylamino acetyichloride in 20 ml of dichloromethane at 0DC. The mixture is stirred for 30min at RT and 5ml of dry methanol are added. After 5min the mixture is evaporated m vacuo to dryness, 10 ml of 0.1MHC1 are added and all volatile compounds are again evaporated. The residue is recrystallized from ethanol to yield 2.1 g dihydrocnloride (410a).<br>
1 g of 410a are dissolved in 15ml dry ethanol, and 550 nag triethylamine are added. 350 mg of methyl acrylate are added. After stirring for 12h the volatile compounds are removed and the residue is purified by chromatography to yield 620 mg of ester (410b).<br>
620 mg of 410b are hydroly2ed by heating it with 5 ml of 0.1N IJC1 for 30min to 60°C. The aqueous phase is removed by evaporation under reduced pressure to yield 720 mg of the hydrochloride (410c) after drying in vacuo.<br>
100 mg of 410c are activated in 5 ml trichloromethane by addition of 50 mg of carbonyldiimidazole. Subsequently 80 mg 3-[4^1-Beiizyl-l,2J3,6'-tettahydro-pyridin-4-yI)-3-fhioro-phenyl]-5-hydroxymethyl-oxazoHdm-2-one (US Pat. No. 6,271,383) are added, and the mixture is stirred for lh. After aqueous workup the free base is chromatographed to yield 89 mg3:[13-(2-Dimethylamino-aceryl)-l,4,10-trioxa-7J13-diaza-cyclopentadec-7-y]]-propionic acid 3-[4-(l -benzyl-1 ^^.S-tetrahydro-pyridin-*-yl)-3-fluoro-phenyI]-2-oxo-oxazolidin-5-ylmethyl ester (410d).<br><br>
II. Coupling of 21 deoxy azithromycin to Oxazolidinones<br><br>
2 g of 2" deoxya2itbromycin (401a) bis-(trifluoro acetate) are reacted with 220 mg of succinic anhydride hi trichloromethane under reflux for 5h- The mixture is cooled to RT and I.2gof3-[4^1-Ben^l-l^,6-tetiahydn&gt;-pyridia-4-yl)-3-ilaoro-phenyl]-5-hydroxymethyl-oxazolidu&gt;2-one trifluoroacetate (US Pat. No. 6,271,383) and 520 mg DCC are added. The mixture is stirred for In at RT and filtered. After evaporation of the solvent and recrystallization with 2-propanol/ethyl acetate 1.2 g of the coupled product (409) are obtained.<br><br><br>
1 gof eperezolide (412a) (LH00592, Ford et al., 1996) are dissolved ro 15 ml of dry dichloromethane, and 250 mg of triethylamine are added. 230 mg of acroylchloride are added After stirring for 12h the volatile compounds are removed by evaporation and the residue is dissolved in 20 ml of dry ethanol. 1.9giso-desmethyl-azithromycin are added_ After stirring for 46h, the mixture is evaporated to dryness, filtered over a short column of silica gel and chromatographed to yield 900 mg of the michael-adduct 412c.<br>
Example 3: Cycloserine antimicrobials and derivatives thereof<br>
The resurgence of tuberculosis has been characterized by the emergence of significant numbers of drug-resistant strains. Furthermore, microorganisms of the Mycobacterium avium complex, opportunistic pathogens common in AIDS patients, are inherently resistant to many traditional antimycobacterial agents. Hence, the development of novel drugs for the treatment of atypical infections by M- avium, Mycobacterium intracellulare, and multiple-drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis is urgently needed.<br>
The mycobacterial cell wall is an effective barrier that contributes to drug resistance. Inhibitors of cell wall biosyn-thesis not only are potential antimycobacterial agents but also increase mycobacterial susceptibility to other<br><br>
antimicrobial agents. One inhibitor of cell wall synthesis is D-cycloserine (D-4-amino-isoxazolidone [DCS]), a cyclic structural analog of D-alanine- D-Amino acids, especially D-alanine, D-gluta-raate, and D-aminophnelate, are important components of aJ] bacterial cell walls, including those of mycobacteria. Alanine is usually available as the L stereoisomer, and the conversion to D-alanine by the cytoplasmic enzyme D-alanine racemase is required for the initial step in the alanine branch of peptidoglycan biosynthesis. D-Alanine is converted to the dipeptide D-alanyl-D-alanine in a reaction catalyzed by D-alanylralanine synthetase (D-alanine ligase). In Escherichia coli, both D-alanine raeemase and D-alanine ligase are targets of DCS. Moreover, the biosynthesis of mycolyl-arabinogalactan- pepridoglycan complex is inhibited by DCS in M. tuberculosis, and biochemical studies indicated that D-alanine ligase is one of the targets m mycobacteria. DCS is an effective antimycDbacterial agent but is rarely prescribed and used only in combined therapies due to its adverse effects. These side effects are due to binding of DCS to neuronal N-methyl aspartate receptors and inhibition of enzymes that metabolize and synthesize the neurotransmitter g-aminobutyric acid. Nevertheless, DCS is an excellent candidate for   -the development of anew generation of antibiotics. Two important considerations predict that rationally designed derivatives of DCS may be more efficacious antimicrobial agents. First, DCS targets participate in essential steps of cell wall synthesis. Second, DCS resistance has not yet become an important clinical problem. I. Conpling of l,7-Diaia-15-crown-5with cycloserine:<br><br><br>
100 mg of 410c are activated in 5ml trichlorom ethane by addition of 45 mg DCC. After 5min, 21 mg cycloserine and a few crystals 4-N,N-dirnethylaminopyridin are added. The mixture is stirred for lb, filtered, concentrated and purified "by flash-chromatography to yield 72 mg of the cycloserine derivative (411):<br>
Example 4: Metronidazole compounds and derivatives thereof. I. Coupling of Metronidazole to 2' deoxyazithromycin<br><br>
5 g Acroylchlorid are dissolved in 10 ml dichloromethane and added slowly at 0DC to a solution of 9 g Metronidazole and 5,6g triethylamine in 50 ml dichloromethane under vigorous stirring. After completion the temperature is raised to RT and stirring is continued for 1 h. The solvent is evaporated under reduced pressure and the product purified by flash chromatography to yield 8 g metronidazole acrylate.<br>
920 mg metronidazole acrylate and 1 g 2 '-deoxyazithromycin (406a) are dissolved in 15 ml dry ethanol and stirred for 24h. After evaporation of the solvent and chromatography S00 mg of the coupling product (406) is obtained-<br>
