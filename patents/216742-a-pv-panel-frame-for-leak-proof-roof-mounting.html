				<td>The invention relates to a PV panel Frame for leak proof mounting to <br>
 accomodate plurality of modules of different capacities and dimensions.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Large PV system having higher capacity, it is necessary to use plurality  of PV panels connected in series or parallel  to  meet the specific: requirement of the system.<br>
Photovoltaic power is used as an alternate source to conventional sources of electricity for various reasons. The electricity is generated directly from sunlight by the PV modules using mono crystalline silicon solar cells laminated in Ethyl Vinyl Acetate and a high transmission toughened glass surface. Photovoltaic system is made use of in different areas like Telecom, Community lighting, Railway signaling, Water pumping, Battery charging, and as Power plants. The power plants are of different type such as Stand alone PV system, Grid interactive and roof top system and Hybrid system.<br>
In all these places, different capacity PV panels are used depending on the power requirement. These panels are mounted on a supporting structure with requisite slope at different elevation in open ground/open terrace depending on space availability. There are disadvantages associated with the present system of PV panel frame assembly.<br>
One of the main disadvantage associated with the present system of PV panel frame assembly is that there is no protection against 1eakage „<br>
mother disadvantage associated  with the present system  of  PV panel frame assembly is that the PV panels are assembled in  site and is complex"<br>
In one of the proposed system of installing PV system, grid interactive power plants withs simi1ar feature tailored  to the building load requirement and is installed on roof tops of the building. As we know, the PV panel roof system is no where brought into existence. If the panels are to be used as roof for the shelter as well as for power production, then the panel moun-ting arrangement needs to have some special feature so as to prevent the rain water entry. For such requirement, the existing panel mounting arrangement is not suitable as it would allow the rain water to come in. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Therefore the main object of the present invention of a PV panel frame for a roof system is that the frame structures are modular and the PV panel can be assembled on to the frame from inside itself.<br>
Another object of the present invention is that the frames can be first assembled without PV panels mounted on it so that damages to the PV panels which are fragile and delicate in nature are avoided during erection.<br>
Yet  another  obejct of the present invention  is  that  periodic maintenance  of cleaning and replacement of damaged panel can  be done from inside as the clamping is done at the bottom, Still  another object- of the present invention is that the  moun-ting of the PV panels is; such that the assembly of the PV  panels<br>
on the frame are leakproof.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is that the panel fixing clamps are tied to the frame so that they are not misplaced when they are removed for replacement of panel. The joints of PV panel is such that the gasket material used for sealing is not exposed to the sunlight, thus preventing degradation due to weathering which result in increasing life and reducing downtime.<br>
Further object of the present invention is that the panel frames are of improved design which can withstand wind load upto 141 kg/ sq.m which is expected at a height of 3011 as per IS 875 and the frames are galvanised for protection from corrosion. The frames can be assembled lengthwise, one adjacent to the other and widthwise, one below the other and provide a leakproof joint during rain due to the profile of the frame along the width. The channel depth and width is selected in such a way that minimum amount of water is allowed to collect and drain into channel of the adjacent frame and reaches the edge of the array.<br>
Yet a further object of the present invention is that the supporting arrangement of frame is made to avoid any misalignment due to variation in the frame dimension and the variation in the location of supporting member are adjusted easily. There is also provision for fixing of gutters at the bottom most frames.<br>
According to the present invention there is provided a PV panel frame for leakproof roof mounting comprising frame assembly supporting a plurality of PV modules characterized in that a raised sealing surface is provided on frame on which the PV module is placed, a gasket being positioned between said FV module and frames to seal the joint, a<br>
ohannel being formed along the length and breadth of said elevated sealing surface for free flow of water on assembling the frame, ends of said frames being provided with overlapping portions to secure leakproof joints, frame assembly being also provided with U-shaped bend to facilitate multiframe assemblies assembled sideways to make the said leakproof joints rigid, and gussets for fixing the frame on to the inclined supports.<br>

SUMMARY OF THE PRESENT INVENTION<br>
The present invention of PV panel mounting frame (3,3A) is  aimed<br>
at  providing  a standard mounting hardware for  assembly  of  PV<br>
panels (1) as roofing to the building. Conventional truss  struc-<br>
ture as required for roofing of asbestos/GI sheet is only  needed to support this frame (16) as roof structure.<br>
1.  The PV module frame (3,3A) provides a raised sealing  surface<br>
(.17)  with a flasible  gasket (5) for mounting the PV  panel  such<br><br>
that the joint is leakproof against rain.<br>
2.	The frame assembly (15) is such that the rain water is channe<br>
lised into channels (4) which are aligned in one line when a<br>
number of frames (3,3A) are assembled so that the flooding of PV frame (1) is avoided;<br>
3.	The other salient feature is that the mounting arrangement  is<br>
from  the bottom end which is of great convenience  for  assembly<br>
and maintenance when intended for use on tall building.<br>
4.	The solar panel assembly also caters for the higher tolerances<br>
of  truss  work  such that the basic  requirement  of  protection<br>
against rain is fully met.<br>
For higher capacity PV system, it is necessary to use more number of PV panels (1) connected in series or parallel to meet the specific requirement of system. The existing arrangement also can accomodate any number of panels but without giving any protection against leakage. The present invention provides the •flexibility of adding any number of frames both width and lengthwise without sacrificing the space besides ensuring protec-tion against leakage as shown in Figs. 15 and 20.<br>
Fig.l  shows the PV module (1) which consists of cell mounted  on<br>
aluminium frame with overall dimension 528 x 1203mm and  capacity<br>
of 70 Wp . The PV panel (1) frame has 4 slots (2) for module moun—<br>
ting and provided with terminal block (14) at the bottom of  each<br>
pane .1 
Figs. 4  &amp;  8 shows the frame assembly -••• I and II and are  the  PV panel frame (3,3A) of the invention.<br>
This frame (3,3A) supports and holds 5 numbers of PV modules (1). The uniqueness of the frame is its raised sealing surface (17) as shown in section-BB <fig.6 of the frame assembly over which pv module is placed and in between modu.1. e gasket fixed to seal joint. this also clearly shows channel ing along length width with elevated surface for free flow water without any flooding. section-aa joint detail wherein multiple frames can be assembled at front rear when overlapped provides leak proof></fig.6>
From the end view (Fig. 5), we can see that one side of the  frame (3,3A)  has  a U— bend (11) and this facilitates  when  multiframe assemblies are assembled sideways provides the required  rigidity and  at  the  same time prevents water  leakge.  In  the  bottom, gussets (5) have been provided for fixing the frame (3,3A) on  to the beams of structure on which the frame is mounted. The  difference  between Figs. 4 &amp; 8 is only the location  of  the gusset (5) to facilitate fixing of the structure to the beams. The clamps (10) for fixing the panel (1) are fixed to this  frame (3,3A) after galvanising with the help of a chain (9) . The Fig. 12 shows the PV modules (1) mounted on frame  sssembly....ll (3A)  with gasket (5) for sealing and clamp (10) for holding  the panel ( 1 ) . The  frames (3,3A) shown in Figs, 4/8 are to be provided with  the<br>
Jf-ingle side self adhesive closed cell foam type material on all the surfaces. Location for gasket (5) fixing is shown in Figs.4/8 so that gasket (5) provides plain surface all along the geometry of the panel (1 ).<br>
The PV panel (1) is placed on the gasketed area such that it aligns with the frame edge on all the four sides of the panel and the termination of the panel on one side. Each of these panels are retained securely to the frame by using the clamp (10) provided in the frames. After the clamp (10) is tightened, the lock nut (6) is tightened to prevent accidental loosening of the clamp (10). Fig. 15 shows the arrangement of multiple frames (3,3A) efver.<br>
apped along the length with PV modules (1).<br>
Fig.5 shows multiple frame arrangement with frames (3,3A) along the length and width with PV modules and how this frame forms into roof.<br>
Depending  upon the requirements of the roof area to  be  covered with  PV  panels  as number of frames on the  design  are  to  be .•assembled both length as well as width wise. These figures also shows the arrangement of the assembly. The frame assembly provides overlap between the frames on  either direction so that water leakage at the joints is prevented. The  manual procedure of assembly is to erect the frame  assembly in  position  for  the  entire roof and then  fit  the  PV  panel reaching from inside and clamp. With this arrangement, the necessity of climbing over the roof for fitting/replacement especially when they are on top of multistory building can be avoided.<br>
The constructional features are :<br>
1.	Modular frame structure (,3,3A) for- the assembly of 5 PV panels<br>
(1) of size 528 (W) x 1203 (L) mm in one.<br>
2.	The PV panels (1) can be assembled on to the frame (3,3A) from<br>
inside  itself, ie. no need to climb on to the roof  which  gives<br>
the following advantages.<br>
3.	a.	The  frames (3,3A) can be first assembled  without  PV  panel<br>
mounted  on  it  so that the damages to the  PV  panel  which  is<br>
fragile and delicate in nature is avoided during erection.<br>
b.	For- periodic maintenance of cleaning and replacement in  case<br>
of damaged panel, it can be done from inside itself as the  c 1 am-<br>
ping is done of the bottom.<br>
3.	The mounting arrangement of the PV panel ( 1 ) is such  that  a<br>
leakproof  roof panel is got after the assembly of the PV  panels<br>
on the frame .<br>
4.	The panel fixing clamps (10) are tied to the frame 
that they are not misplaced when they are removed for replacement<br>
of panel „<br>
5.	The joint design of the PV panel is such that the gasket  (5)<br>
material  used  for sealing is nest exposed to the  sunlight  thus<br>
preventing  the degradation of the same due to weathering  resul-<br>
ting in elimination of periodic replacement,<br>
6.	This frame (3,3A) design is such that it can  also  withstand<br>
the  wind load to the tune of 141 Kg/Sq.M which is expected at  a<br>
height of 30M as per IS 875.<br>
7.	The frame (3,3A) is galvanised to protect it from  atmospheric<br>
corrosion in the course of time as well to proved aesthetic look.<br>
8.	The frame design is made in such a way that these frames can be<br>
assembled lengthwise one adjacent to the other and widthwise one below<br>
the other, can provide a leakproof joint during rain.<br>
9.	The profile of the frame along the width is made in such a way that<br>
when two frames are assembled lengthwise, the water flowing from the<br>
top frame, at any case would not leak through the joint.<br><br>
10.	The channel depth and width is chosen in such a way that minimum<br>
amount of water get collected and drain into channel of the adjacent<br>
frame and reaches the edges of the array.<br>
11.	The supporting arrangement of frame is made such that any<br>
misalignment due to variation in the frame dimension and the variation<br>
in the location of supporting member are easily get adjusted.<br>
12.	Provision is made for fixing of gutters at the bottom most frame.<br>
13.	The FV panel frame is mounted on supporting structures (16) which<br>
ensure that the frame maintains an angle between 15oand 20o with the<br>
horizontal plane when finally installed.<br>
14.	To prevent misplacement, the clamps (10) are tied to frame (3, 3A) by<br>
means of chain (9).<br>
15.	The  invention  described hereinabove  is  in  relation to  non-limiting embodiments and as defined by the accompanying claims.<br><br><br><br>
