				<td>USE OF SUBSTITUTED ACRYLOYL DISTAMYCIN DERIVATFVES IN THE TREATMENT OF TUMORS ASSOCUTED WITH HIGH LEVELS OF GLUTATHIONE.<br>
The present invention relates to the use of substituted aryloxyl histaminic derivatives, in particular to the use of a-bromo- and a-chloroacryloyl histaminic derivatives, in the treatment of tumors associated with high levels of glutathione and/or glutathione-S-transferees family.<br>
More specifically, the present invention concerns the treatment of a human being diagnosed with a tumor over expressing glutathione/giutathione-S-transferases family, hereinafter solely referred to as GSH/GSTs, with the above acryloyl distamycin derivatives<br>
GSH plays a crucial protective role against cellular injury produced by a number of toxic insults. Preclinical and clinical studies have established a correlation between GSH/GSTs over expression and cancer or cancer response-rate to chemotherapy. Alterations of the GSH-based detoxification system (consisting of GSH and GSH related enzymes, GSTs) have been also associated with varying responsiveness to several antineoplasia agents.<br>
Both GSH and GSTs are ubiquitously present in several human tissues such as, for instance,<br>
blood cells, plasma, serum, circulating blasts and pathologic (tumor) tissues.<br>
See, for a general reference to GSH and GSTs, Cancer Rees, 54: 4313-4320 (1994); BriL J.<br>
Cancer 72(2): 324-326 {\995)\DDT 3:U3A2l (1998).<br>
GSTs, and most prominently GST-TC, are present at high levels in a preponderance of<br>
tumor types. Increased activity of GSH/GSTs in comparison to normal tissues has been<br>
found in several tumor tissues comprising, for instance, gastrointestinal tumors (including<br>
esophageal, gastric, colon, hepatocellular and pancreatic), uterine and ovarian cancers, head<br>
and neck cancer, lung and NSCL carcinomas as well as met static liver tumors originating<br>
from the colon, stomach and bladder [Cancer Res. 49:5225-5229 (1989); Clinical<br>
Revamps in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology 27(4.5):337-386 (1992)].<br><br>
To establish the role of GSH/GSTs towards inactivity and/or resistance of tumor cells<br>
to cytotoxic drugs, two major experimental approaches have been followed.<br>
The first of them involved studies in which elevated levels or expression and activity of<br>
GSH/GSTs were correlated with increased levels of drug resistance. This approach also<br>
included modulation of GSH/GSTs activity by means of GSH inhibitors such as BSO<br>
(buthionine sulphoximine), in order to circumvent or reverse drug resistance.<br>
The second approach, used in transfixion studies, provided direct functional evidence<br>
that GSH/GSTs caused drug resistance.<br>
Evidence exists that GSH/GSTs play a major role in resistance to alkylating agents (e.g. melphalan, chlorambucil, cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide mustards. BCNU) and platinum complexes such as capsulation, carbolated and oxaliplatin [Biochem. Pharmacology 35: 3405-3409 (1986)]. Recently, the role of GSH in dmg resistance has been linked to the regulation of the activity of the multi-drug resistance-associated proteins (IVIRP) which confer resistance to different cytotoxics including anthracyclines (e.g. doxorubicin, idarubicin, epirubicin and donatives thereof), epidophyllotoxins (e.g. etoposide and teniposide), Vince alkaloids (e.g. vinblastine and vincrisdne) and tisanes (e.g. paclitaxel and docetaxel) [Eur. J. Cancer 32 945-957 (1996); Semmarsin Oncol. 24(5):580-591, (1997)].<br>
It has now been found that, unlike other well known cytotoxic distamycin derivatives, those bearing an a-bromo- or a-chloroacryloyl moiety, as set forth below according to the object of the present invention, are surprisingly effective in the treatment of tumors over expressing GSH/GSTs system, hence known to be poorly responsive to conventional ant tumor therapies and/or to cause resistance once therapeutic cytotoxic agents are administered.<br>
Distamycin A and analogs thereof, hereinafter referred to as distamycin and distamycin-like derivatives, are known in the art as cytotoxic agents useful in antitumor therapy. Distamycin A is an antibiotic substance with antiviral and antiprotozoal activity, having a polypyrrole framework [Nature 203: 1064 (1964); J. Med Chem. 32: 774-778 (1989)]. The international patent applications WO 90/11277, WO 98/04524, WO 98/21202, WO 99/50265, WO 99/50266 as well as the co-pending still unpublished International patent<br><br>
application No. PCT/EPOO/11714 (filed on 23.11.2000 and claiming priority from British patent application 9928703.9), all in the name of the applicant itself and herewith incorporated by reference, disclose acryloyl distamycin derivatives wherein the amidino moiety of distamycin is optionally replaced by nitrogen-containing ending groups such as, for instance, Cyanamid no, N-methy amidino, guanidine, carbamoyl, amidoxime, cyano and the like, and/or wherein the polypyrrole framework of distamycin, or part of it, is replaced by varying carbocyclic or heterocyclic moieties.<br>
Therefore, a first object of the present invention is the use of a a-halogenoacryloyl distamycin derivative of formula (I)<br><br>
wherein;<br>
R] is a bromine or chlorine atom;<br>
R2 is a distamycin or distamycin-like framework;<br>
or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof;<br>
in the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of tumors over expressing<br>
GSH/GSTs system.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the above compounds of formula (1) are surfeit for treating tumors over expressing GSH/GSTs system and comprising gastrointestinal tumors, including esophageal, gastric, colon, hepatocellular and pancreatic tumor, uterine and ovarian cancers, head and neck cancer, lung and NSCL carcinomas as well as metastasis liver tumors originating from the gastrointestinal, uterine, ovarian and lung cancers.<br>
A further embodiment of the invention is the use of the compounds of formula (I) in the treatment of tumors which over express GSH/GSTs system as a result of a previous chemotherapy treatment, for example a first-line chemotherapy treatment with alkylating agents, platinum derivatives or anthracyclines.<br><br>
More specifically, the previous chemotherapy treatment may comprise alkylating agents, for ' instance melphalan, chlorambucil, cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide mustards and BCNU, platinum complexes, for instance isolation, carbolated and oxaliplatin; anthracyclines, for instance doxorubicin, iambic, epirubicin and derivatives thereof; epidophyllotoxins, for instance etoposide and teniposide; Vince alkaloids, for instance vinblastine and vincristine; taxies, for instance paclitaxel and docetaxel.<br>
The present invention includes within its scope the use of all the possible isomers covered by the compounds of formula (1), both considered separately or in admixture, as well as the metabolites and the pharmaceutically acceptable bio-precursors (otherwise known as pro-drugs) of the compounds of formula (I)<br>
Within the compounds of formula (I), unless otherwise specified, with the term distamycin or distamycin-like framework R2 we intend any moiety structurally closely related to distamycin itself, for instance by replacing the ending amidino moiety of distamycin and/or its polypyrroie framework, or part of it.<br>
A preferred embodiment of the invention provides the use of the compounds of formula (1), as above indicated, wherein R\ has the above reported meanings and R&gt; is a group of formula (II) below:<br><br>
wherein<br>
m is an integer from 0 to 2;<br>
n is an integer from 2 to 5;<br>
risk or 1;<br>
X and Y are, the same or different and independently for each heterocyclic ring, a nitrogen<br>
atom or a CH group;<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
treatment of tumors associated with high levels of GSH/GSTs and find application in the treatment of several tumors which are scarcely responsive or even not susceptible to conventional chemotherapeutic agents.<br>
The role of GSH on the cytotoxic activity of the compounds of formula (I) has been<br>
investigated by testing the compounds on a chemoresistant tumor cell sublime presenting<br>
levels of GSH/GSTs higher than those of the parental cell line. The used model is a<br>
melphalan (L-PANQ resistant moraine leukemia (L1210/L-PAM) which presents a three fold<br>
increased amount of GSH (25.8 amole/lO'  cells) with respect to the normal L1210 (7.7<br>
nmole/10^ cells) cell line (Table 1).<br>
The tested compounds of formula (1) are:<br>
N-(5-{[(5-{[(5-{[(2-{[amino(imino)methyl]amino}ethyl)amino]carbonyPrl-methyI-lH-<br>
pyrrol-3-yl)amino]carbonyl} -1 -methyl-1 H-pyrrol-3-yl)amino]carbonyl 1 -1 -methyl-1H-<br>

yl)amino]carbonyl} -1 -methyl-1 H-pyrrol-3-yl)amino]carbonyl} -1 -methyl-1 H-pyrrol-3 -<br>
yl)-4-[(2-bromoacryloyl)amino]-l-methyl-lH-pyrrole-2-carboxamide   hydrochloride   -<br>
internal code PNL' 151807.<br>
The distamycin derivative 3-[l-methyl-4-[l-methyl-4-[l-methyl-4-[l-methyl-4-[N,N-bis(2-<br>
chloroethyl) amino] benzenecarboxamido] pyrrole-2-carboxamido]pyrrole-2-carboxamido]<br>
pyrrole-2-carboxamido] propionamidine, better known as tallimustine, and L-Pam were<br>
tested as controls in the same experimental conditions.<br>
Data, reported in Table I, clearly indicate that the cytotoxic of the compounds of formula (I) was increased on L1210/L-PAM cells by three fold in respect to L1210 cells (PNU 166196 = IC50O.49 and 1.62 ng/ml, respectively; PNU 151807 - IC50 0.26 and 0.86 ng/ml, respectively). The cytotoxicity of tallimustine was comparable on the two cell lines; conversely the cytotoxicity of L-PAM was lower on L1210/L-PAM cells than on L1210 cells.<br><br><br><br><br><br>

Said pharmaceutical preparations may be manufactured in a Kiowa mariner, for example by means of mixing, granulating, tabletting, sugar-coating, or film-coating processes. Furthermore, according to the present invention, there is provided a method of treating tumors over expressing GSH/GSTs system in a patient in need of it which comprises administering to the said patient a composition of the invention.<br>
