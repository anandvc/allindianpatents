				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The  present invention relates to a   process  for the   preparation of<br>
enantiomerically pure D-(-)-3-acetylthio-2-methylpropanoic acid.of formula (1)<br>
shown in drawing accompanying this specification is prepared by chemoselective and enantioselective hydrolysis of DL-(+)-methyl 3-acetylthio-2-methylpropanoate of formula (2). More particularly the present invention relates to production of D-(-)-3-acetylthio-2-methyipropanoic acid (1) by using a strain of Pseudomonas fluorescens as biocatalyst.<br>
D-(-)-3-acetylthio-2-methylpropanoic acid is thus obtained in optically<br>
pure form.   The optically pure D-(-)-3-acetylthio-2-methylpropanoic acid is a<br>
crucial  intermediate  in the production of Angiotensin  Converting  Enzyme<br>
(ACE) inhibitors,  such as Captopril and Alacepril which are  used  for the<br>
treatment of hypertension and congestive heart failure.<br>
This biocatalyst also hydrolyses methyl 3-chloro-2-methylpropanoate, methyl 2-phenylpropanoate and ethyl 2-chloropropanoate of formulae (3), (4) and (5) respectively, which are useful as intermediates for Pharmaceuticals and agro - chemicals.<br>
DL-(±)-3-acetylthio-2-methylpropanoic acid can be prepared from methyl methacrylic acid and thioacetic acid. This racemic material can be chemically resolved to D-(-)-3-acetylthio-2-methylpropanoic acid by using varoius optically active amines such as 1,2-diphenylethyl amine or 2-amino-1-butanol (Houbiers, Johannes Paulus Marie, Japan Kokai Tokyo Koho, 80-38386,1980; N. Ohashi, S. Nagata, S. Katsube, Japan Kokai Tokkyo Koho, 81 - 7756, 1981; J. Iwao, M. Oya, E. Kato, T. Watanabe, Japan Kokai Tokkyo Koho, 78 - 151912, 1978). Alternately D-(-)-3-acetylthio-2-<br>
methylpropanoic acid   can be prepared by chemical synthesis using   D-3-<br>
hydroxy-2-methylpropanoic   acid   as   starting material   (M.   Shimazaki,   J.<br>
Hasegawa,    K.    Kan,   K.   Nomura,   Y.   Nose,   H.   Kondo,   T.    Ohashi,<br>
K.Watanabe,   Chem.   Pharm.  Bull.,  30, 3139,   1982).   However   these<br>
methods consumed  large amount of energy and expenstve agents, which<br>
had     tendency     to    remain     as     impurities in     D-(-)-3-acetylthio-2-<br>
methylpropanoic     acid.      Moreover,      conversion      of      D-3-hydroxy-2-<br>
methylpropanoic acid  to D-(-)-3-acetylthio-2-methylpropanoic acid  required several   steps   of   chemical   reactions.   The   enzymatic    methods   are economically  and  environmentally friendly and    provide    much  cleaner products.<br>
D-(-)-3-Acetylthio-2-methylpropanoic acid has also been produced by the resolution of DL-(±)-methyl 3-acetylthio-2-methylpropanoic acid by Pseudomonas fluorescens, IFO 3081 (A. Sakimae, A. Hosoi, E. Kobayashi, N. Ohsuga, R. Numazawa, I. Watanabe, H. Ohnishi, Biosci. Biotech. Biochem., 56, 1252, 1992). The organism was isolated by screening of organisms from stock cultures obtained from Institute of Fermentation, Osaka (IFO), the Institute of Applied Microbiology, University of Tokyo (IAM) and American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). Several organisms, which were capable of producing D- (-) -3-Acetylthio-2-methylpropanoic acid, were isolated, but Pseudomonas fluorescens, IFO 3081 was found to be the best and was used for further studies. To obtain D-(-)-3-Acetylthio-2-methylpropanoic acid with Pseudomonas fluorescens, IFO 3081, the reaction was done at substrate concentration of 0.225 moles per liter at pH<br>
7.0 at 30°C. The cells had an activity of 558 units/g-cells. The D-(-)-3-acetylthio-2-methylpropanoic acid was produced in 97.2% enantiomeric excess. Another strain of Pseudomonas putida MR2068 has also been described (A. Sakimae, E. Ozaki, H. Toyama, N. Ohsuga, R. Numazawa, I. Muraoka, E. Hamada, H. Ohnishi, Biosci. Biotech. Biochem., 56, 1341, 1992) which produced D-(-)-3-acetylthio-2-methylpropanoic acid in 98.6 % enantiomeric excess. The product obtained by these methods was contaminated with the undesired L form of the acid owing to chemical degradation or non-specific enzymatic reaction or both.<br>
The main objective of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of D-(-)-3-acetylthio-2-methylpropanoic acid from DL-(±)-methyl 3-acetylthio-2-methylpropanoate as a single enantiomer, using a strain of Pseudomonas fluorescens as biocatalyst.<br>
Another objective is to use a strain of Pseudomonas fluorescens,<br>
deposited in Microbial Type Culture Collection (a constituent laboratory of<br>
applicant), Institute  of  Microbial Technology,   Chandigarh,   India,   having<br>
accession   number  MTCC   B0015,   where   B  denotes   a   Bacterium,   as<br>
biocatalyst.<br>
The strain designated MTCC B0015 was found Gram's negative, aerobic, rod shaped, fluorescent, green pigment producing and non-endospore forming. The characteristics usually associated with genus Pseudomonas (Sergey's Manual of Systematic Bacteriology, Vol. 1, Williams and Wilkins, Baltimore, USA, 1994).<br>
The strain  of Pseudomonas  fluorescens MTCC  BO015  used  as<br>
biocatalyst is different from those reported earlier in that: (i) it has activity of about 2400 units/g-cells, (ii) it produces D-(-)-3-acetylthio-2-methylpropanoic acid as a single enantiomer and (iii) it can be used at substrate concentration of up to 3 moles per liter.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for the preparation of enantiomerically pure D-(-)-3-acetylthio-2-methylpropanoic acid, which comprises: contacting DL-(±)-methyl 3-acetylthio-2-methylpropanoate, under agitation at pH 6.8 with a halotolerent strain of Pseudomonas fluorescens having characteristics as described herein grown in a known manner in a conventional nutrient medium at pH between 5.0 to 11.0, at temperature between 15 to 37°C for at least a period of 10 min., separating the biomass by conventional methods followed by recovering D-(-)-3-acetylthio-2-methylpropanoic acid by conventional solvent extraction methods.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the conventional nutrient medium used may be such as peptone and beef extract or a medium consisting of glucose, ammonium sulphate, ammonium phosphate, yeast extract and trace amounts of mineral salts such as ferrous sulphate, magnesium sulphate and copper sulphate<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention contacting of DL-(±)-methyl 3-acetylthio-2-methylpropanoate with a halotolerent strain of Pseudomonas fluorescens may be effected for a period of 10 min. to 6 hr.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention the contacting of DL-(±)-methyl 3-acetylthid-2-methylpropanoate with a halotolerent strain of<br>
Pseudomonas fluorescens may be effected at substrate concentration of 0.01 moles to 3 moles per liter of buffer.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the separation of biomass may be effected by filteration or centrifugation.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the solvents used for the extraction of D-(-)-3-acetylthio-2-methylpropanoic acid may be such as diethyl ether, ethyl acetate, chloroform, dichloromethane or similar water immissible solvents.<br>
The biocatalyst used for the production of optically   pure   D-(-)-3-<br>
acetylthio-2-methylpropanoic acid  should  have the   following properties  :<br>
(i) it should chemoselectively hydrolyze  the  methoxycarbonyl  group.   The<br>
acetylthio group which is also   present and prone to undergo hydrolysis<br>
should remain unaffected, (ii) it should enantioselectively hydrolyze the S -<br>
enantiomer, the R - enantiomer should remain unaffected, (iii) it should work<br>
under neutral conditions of pH, as both the substrate and product are prone<br>
to undergo degradation at acidic as well as basic   pH   and (iv) from a<br>
commercial  point of view it should  be able to   tolerate high  substrate<br>
concentration.<br>
The organism is isolated in the following manner. The soil and water<br>
samples from Lothal,  Gujarat, were  collected,  as  they were expected  to<br>
yield halotolerant strains -of microorganisms.   Lothal is an area in Western<br>
India, which is in close proximity with seawater. These samples were plated<br>
after dilution with sterile distilled water on  nutrient agar plates containing<br>
tributyrin. The plates were incubated at a temperature between 15 and 30°C<br>
for a period between 24 and 48 hr. The microbial colonies producing a clearing zone, underneath or around the growth on the plates were picked up and purified by repeated streaking on nutrient agar plates, -The purified microorganisms were tested for their ability to produce D-(-)-3-acetylthio-2-methylpropanoic acid from DL-(±)-methyl 3-acetylthio-2-methylpropanoate. The organism, which produced maximum yield of optically pure D- (-) -3-acetylthio-2-methylpropanoic acid, was selected. The selected isolate was deposited in Microbial Type Culture Collection, Institute of Microbial Technology, Chandigarh, India and has been given an accession number MTCC B0015, where B denotes a bacterium.<br>
The isolated strain was found to be Pseudomonas fluorescens, based on its morphological and physiological characteristics.<br>
It has been observed that the strain designated as MTCC B0015 produces<br>
D-(-)-3-acetylthio-2-methylpropanoic acid from DL-(±)-methyl 3-acetylthio 2-methylpropanoate at a rate of about 2.4 g per hr. per g of cells (dry cell weight).<br>
It   has   also been observed that the strain   designated   as   MTCC B0015   remains effective     for     the     production  of D-(-)-3-acetylthio-2-methylpropanoic acid  from  DL-(±)-methyl  3-acetylthio-2-methylpropanoate at a substrate concentration of up to three moles per liter.<br>
Details of the process are given below:<br>
The  soil  and  water samples were  collected  from   Lothal, Gujarat, India.  The samples were diluted with sterile distilled water and  plated on<br>
nutrient  agar  -   tributyrin    plates.       The   plates    were   incubated   at   a temperature ranging from 15 to 37°C for a period of between 24 and 48 hr. The microbes that produced a   clearing   zone underneath or around the growth on   the   plates were   purified by repeated restreaking of individual colonies  on nutrient  agar  plates.   A few cells from the  purified   colonies were  transferred  to  a   nutrient  agar  plate   containing   DL-(±)-methyl   3-acetylthio-2-methylproponate   and   alizarin   red   dye.     The   colonies    of microorganisms, which produced yellow zone underneath or around the growth, were selected for further screening. A   loopful   of  each of these selected microorganisms was inoculated in a medium consisting of peptone and beef extract or the  like,  pH adjusted to neutral and incubated  in  an orbital shaker at 200 rpm. at a temperature between 15 and 37°C.   After a period  between 24 and 48 hr., cells from these cultures were harvested by centrifugation and washed with phosphate  buffer.   The washed cells were used for reaction with  DL-(±)-methyl  3-acetylthio-2-methylpropanoate   in phosphate   buffer   at   pH   7.0    and   production   of   D-(-)-3-acetylthio-2-methylpropanoic acid was monitored  by thin layer chromatography or high performance liquid chromatography. The following tests were conducted on the strain designated as MTCC B0015:<br>
Growth on MacConkey agar, methyl red test, Voges Proskauer test, citrate and acetate utilization, casein hydrolysis, starch hydrolysis, urea hydrolysis, aesculin hydrolysis, ONPG hydrolysis, nitrate reduction, hydrogen sulphide production, oxidase test, gelatin liquefaction, arginine dihydrolase and production of acid from carbohydrates. These tests were<br>
conducted according to Sergey's Manual of Systematic Bacteriology, Vol. 1, Williams   and   Wilkinson,    Baltimore,    USA,    1994.    Based    upon   the<br>
morphological features and the results of the tests   described   above the<br>
strain  designated   as   MTCC    B0015   was  found   to   be   Pseudomonas<br>
fluorescens.<br>
A further description of the invention is given below in the examples, which should however not be construed to limit the scope of the present<br>
invention.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
The soil and water samples were collected from Lothal, Gujarat, India. The samples were screened for esterase activity by diluting the samples with sterile distilled water and plating on tributyrin containing agar plates (1.5ml tributyrin, 0.2 g calcium carbonate and 3.0 g agar in 200 ml of water). The plates were incubated at a temperature of 30°C for 24 hr. The microbial colonies producing a clearing zone underneath or around the growth on the plates were picked up and purified by repeated streaking on the nutrient agar plates. The purified microorganisms were plated on nutrient agar plates containing DL-(+)-methyl 3-acetylthio-2-methylpropanoate and alizarin red at pH of 7.0. The microbial colonies that produced a yellow zone underneath or around were screened for their ability to produce D-(-)-3-acetylthio-2-methylpropanoic acid from DL-(±)-methyl 3-acetylthio-2-methylpropanoate by individual culture of pure microbes in minimal medium broth in 100 ml flasks at 30°C. The cells were harvested by centrifugation of culture after 24 hr. and 48 hr. and washed with phosphate<br>
buffer at pH 7.0. The washed cells were suspended in phosphate buffer at pH 7.0, DL-(±)-methyl 3-acetylthio-2-methylpropanoate added to it and the contents incubated at 30°C for 12 hr. The cells were removed by centrifugation and the pH of the supernatant was adjusted "to 2.0 with 1 N hydrochloric acid. The supernatant was extracted with diethyl ether. The ethereal layer was separated and shaken with water containing 2% (w/v) sodium bicarbonate. The aqueous layer was separated, its pH adjusted to 2.0 with 12 N hydrochloric acid and extracted with diethyl ether. The ether layer was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and evaporated to leave on oily residue, which was dissolved in chloroform. The optical rotation of chloroform solution was recorded on a polarimeter. Two isolates were found, which gave positive direction of optical rotation. The selected isolates were grown on a medium containing (per liter) of peptone 10 g, beef extract 5 g, pH 7.0 at 30°C at 200 rpm on an orbital shaker." After 24 hr. D-(-)-3-acetylthio-2-methylpropanoic acid producing enzyme was assayed as follows<br>
The cells were isolated by centrifugation and washed with phosphate buffer. 10.5 g of these cells were suspended in 100 ml of 0.05M phosphate buffer, pH 7.0 and 10 g of DL-(±)-methyl 3-acetylthio-2-methylpropanoate added to it and the volume made up to 200 ml with phosphate buffer. The reaction was done at 30°C for one hr., maintaining the pH of the reaction mixture at 7.0 by the addition of 1 N sodium hydroxide. The hydrolytic activity was defined as one unit when 1/162.2 mmol sodium hydroxide was added to the reaction mixture in one hr. The specific activity was defined as<br>
number of units per gram of cells (dry cell weight). One of the isolates, which produced about 2400 units per gram of cells (dry cell weight) was selected and deposited with Microbial Type Culture Collection, Institute of Microbial Technology, Chandigarh and has been given accession number MTCCB0015.<br>

agar, 6 ml   of 1% aqueous bromothymol  blue (and  10g glucose) was<br>
distributed to the tubes with 16 mm diameter. The organism was inoculated<br>
in duplicate tubes. Soft paraffin (melted) was added to one tube to the height of about 3.0 mm above the medium. It was incubated and examined for up to 5 days. The yellow colour in open tubes and green colour in sealed tubes is indicative of positive oxidative and negative fermentative test, respectively.<br>
15.	Gelatin liquefaction: Growth on the nutrient agar gelatin (nutrient agar with<br>
0.4% gelatin)  was flooded with 10 ml of sulfuric acid   pre   saturated with<br>
sodium sulphate. Gelatin hydrolysis was indicated by a clear zone underneath or around the growth.<br>
16.	Oxidase test: The organism were grown on nutrient agar, cells were<br>
removed with a toothpick and applied on a filter paper.   2-3 drops of  1%<br>
aqueous   solution of tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine   dihydrochloride were<br>
put on the cells.   A positive reaction was shown by the development of a<br>
purple colour within ten seconds.<br>
17.	Acid from carbohydrates: The   organism   was inoculated into tubes of<br>
acid  producing medium.    Charge in colour from blue to yellow indicated<br>
the production of acid.   The composition of acid  production  medium was<br>
(per liter) 1g diammonium hydrogen phosphate, 0.2g   potassium chloride,<br>
0.2g magnesium sulphate, 0.2g yeast extract, 15g agar, 15  ml 0.04% (w/v)<br>
solution of bromocresol purple and  sugars at final concentration of 0.05%.<br>
Thus, the strain designated at MTCC B0015 was identified as Pseudomonas<br>
fluorescens based on the morphological  characteristics and the results of<br>
the above tests.<br>

Example 3<br>
This example pertains to the preparation of biocatalyst. The strain of Pseudomonas fluorescens isolated as described in example 1 was maintained on nutrient agar. The slants were incubated at 37°C for 24 hr. A loopful of this actively growing culture was inoculated into a 100 ml<br>
Erlenmeyer flask containing 20 ml of sterile medium consisting of (per liter)<br>
10g peptone and 5g beef extract.  The culture flask was incubated at 37°C<br>
in an orbital shaker at 200 rpm for 12 hr.   A 2ml  portion of this culture was<br>
used to inoculate 200 ml of sterile medium of above composition in each of<br>
the several one-liter flasks. These flasks were incubated at 37°C at 200 rpm<br>
on an   orbital   shaker.    The growth was monitored spectrophotometrically<br>
every 2 hr.    The enzyme activity in cells was monitored by withdrawing an<br>
aliquot of 2 ml every 2 hr. and reacting with DL-(+)-raethyl 3-acetylthio-2-<br>
methylpropanoate at 30°C for one hr. maintaining the pH at 7.0 with 0.05 N<br>
sodium hydroxide. The   fermentation was terminated when there was   no<br>
further increase in activity.<br>
The fermentation broth was centrifuged at 10,000 g for 20 min. to give 14.0 g cells per liter of broth. The dry cell weight was obtained by sequentially heating the cells to a constant weight at 50°C for 12 hr., 80°C for 2hr. and 120°C for 1hr. Thus, 10.5 grams of wet cells, as obtained above, when dried in such away gave rise to approximatly 1.6g of dry cells of the microbial strain designated as MTCC B0015.<br>
EXAMPLE 4:<br>
For the production of D-(-)-3-acetylthio-2-methylpropanoic acid, 6 g of<br>
DL-(±)-methyl 3-acetylthio-2-methylpropanoate was added to 100 ml of 0.05<br>
M phosphate buffer of pH 7.0, containing a suspension of 45g of the cells<br>
(wet cell weight) of Pseudomonas fluorescens obtained as in Example 3. The<br>
reaction was started at 30°C, maintaining the pH of the reaction mixture at<br>
7.0 by the addition of 10% (w/v) aqueous sodium hydroxide. The progress of the reaction was monitored by High Performance Liquid Chromatography. After 2 hr. the reaction mixture was cooled to 4°C in an ice bath and centrifuged at 10000 g for 20 min. The pH of the supernatant was adjusted to 2.0 with 12 N hydrochloric acid. The supernatant was extracted with diethyl ether. The ethereal layer was shaken with 2% (w/v) aqueous sodium bicarbonate. The aqueous layer was cooled in an ice bath, its pH adjusted to 2.0 with 12 N hydrochloric acid and extracted with diethyl ether. The evaporation of diethyl ether from ethereal layer gave D-(-)-3-acetylthio-2-methylpropanoic acid as colorless oil; Yield 49.1%, [α]D 25°,<br>
-57.8° (c=2, CHCI3); 1H NMR (CDCI3): 1.29 (doublet, J=7.2 Hz), 2.35 (singlet),<br>
2.73   (multiple!),   3.05   (doublet  of doublet, J=6.1 &amp;   7.5   Hz),   and   3.13<br>
(doublet of doublet, J=7.1  &amp; 7.5 Hz).  D-(-)-3-Acetylthio-2-methylpropanoic<br>
acid, so   produced   was found   to have ee of    99.7% based on   High<br>
Performance Liquid Chromatography and 1H NMR spectroscopic analysis of<br>
a diastereomer produced by its reaction with  R-(+)-1-(1-naphthyl)ethylamine<br>
in dichloromethane in presence of dicyclohexyl   carbodiimide by standard<br>
protocol.<br>
EXAMPLE 5<br>
For the production of D-(-)-3-acetylthio-2-methylpropanoic acid, 17.6 g of DL-(±)-methyl 3-acetylthio-2-methylpropanoate was added to 100 ml of 0.05 M phosphate buffer of pH 7.0, containing a suspension of 40g of the cells (wet cell weight) of Pseudomonas fluorescens obtained as in Example 3.<br>
The reaction was started at 30°C, maintaining the pH of the reaction mixture<br>
at 7.0   by the addition of 10% (w/v) aqueous   sodium   hydroxide.    The<br>
progress  of the  reaction  was  monitored   by   High    Performance  Liquid<br>
Chromatography.   After 6 hr. the reaction mixture was cooled to 4°C in an<br>
ice bath and centrifuged at 10000 g for 20 min.   The pH of the supernatant<br>
was adjusted to 2.0 with   12   N hydrochloric  acid.   The supernatant was<br>
extracted with ethyl acetate.   The ethyl acetate layer was shaken with 2%<br>
(w/v) aqueous sodium bicarbonate. The aqueous layer was cooled in an ice<br>
bath, its pH adjusted to 2.0 with 12 N hydrochloric acid and  extracted with<br>
ethyl acetate.   The evaporation of ethyl acetate gave   D-(-)-3-acetylthio-2-<br>
methylpropanoic  acid   as colorless   oil; Yield 48.8%, [α]D 25°, -57.7° (c=2,<br>
CHCI3); 1H NMR (CDCI3): 1.29 (doublet, J=7.2 Hz), 2.35 (singlet), 2.73 (multi-<br>
plet),   3.05   (doublet  of doublet, J=6.1 &amp;   7.5   Hz),   and   3.13 (doublet of<br>
doublet,  J=7.1   &amp;  7.5   Hz).   D-(-)-3-Acetylthio-2-methylpropanoic   acid,  so<br>
produced    was   found    to   be   a   single   enantiomer   based   on    High<br>
Performance Liquid Chromatography and 1H NMR spectroscopic analysis of<br>
a diastereomer produced by its reaction with  R-(+)-1-(1-naphthyl)ethylamine<br>
in dichloromethane in presence of dicyclohexyl   carbodiimide by standard<br>
protocol.<br>
EXAMPLE 6<br>
For the production of D-(-)-3-acetylthio-2-methylpropanoic acid, 0.176<br>
g of DL-(±)-methyl 3-acetylthio-2-methylpropanoate was added to 100 ml of 0.05 M phosphate buffer of pH 7.0, containing a suspension of 15g of the cells (wet cell weight) of Pseudomonas fluorescens obtained as in Example 3.<br>
The reaction was started at 30°C, maintaining the pH of the reaction mixture at 7.0   by the addition of 10% (w/v) aqueous   sodium   hydroxide.    The progress of the reaction was  monitored  by   High   Performance  Liquid Chromatography.   After 10 min. the reaction  mixture was cooled to 4°C in an ice bath and centrifuged at 10000 g   for  20 min.     The   pH of the supernatant was adjusted to 2.0 with    12   N  hydrochloric   acid.     The supernatant was extracted  with   diethyl ether.     The   ethereal   layer was shaken with  2%  (w/v)  aqueous sodium bicarbonate.   The aqueous layer was cooled in an ice bath, its pH adjusted to 2.0 with 12 N hydrochloric acid and extracted with diethyl ether. The evaporation of diethyl ether from ethereal layer gave D-(-)-3-acetylthio-2-methylpropanoic acid  as colorless oil; Yield 48.2%, [α]D 25°, -58° (c=2, CHCI3); 1H   NMR (CDCI3): 1.29 (doublet, J=7.2 Hz), 2.35 (singlet), 2.73 (multiple!),  3.05 (doublet of doublet, J=6.1 &amp; 7.5 Hz), and 3.13 (doublet of doublet, J=7.1 &amp; 7.5 Hz). D-(-)-3-Acetylthio-2-methylpropanoic acid, so  produced  was found to be a single enantiomer based   on    High    Performance    Liquid   Chromatography   and   1H   NMR spectroscopic analysis of a diastereomer produced by its reaction with R-(+)-1-(1-naphthyl)ethylamine in dichloromethane  in  presence  of dicyclohexyl carbodiimide by standard protocol.<br>
Advantages of the present invention are:<br>
1. The strain of Pseudomonas fluorescens used as biocatalyst hydrolyses DL-(+)-methyl 3-acetylthio-2-methylpropanoate to D-(-)-3-acetylthio-2-methylpropanoic acid under very mild reaction conditions of temperature<br>
 (30°C) and pH (7.0) and at substrate concentration of up to 3 moles per liter. The conversion rate is high; approximately 2.4 g of acid is produced in one hr. by 1 g of cells (dry cell weight), so that the reaction can be completed in shorter time. These features lead to (i) reduced energy requirements and (ii) high quality of the product as substrate as well as product do not undergo chemical degradation under these conditions, thus leading to an eco-friendly and economic process.<br>
2.	The biocatalyst used  in the process is (i) highly chemoselective for<br>
methoxycarbonyl group.The acetylthio group, prone to hydrolysis and present<br>
in the molecule remains unaffected and (ii) highly enantioselective for S<br>
enantiomer.   These features lead to high chemical   and optical purity   for<br>
the    product, D-(-)-3-acetylthio-2-methylpropanoic acid.<br>
3.	D-(-)-3-Acetylthio-2-methylpropanoic   acid  was  produced  as   a  single<br>
