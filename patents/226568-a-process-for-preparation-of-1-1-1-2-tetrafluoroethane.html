				<td>This invention relates to a process for the preparation of 1,1,1,2-tetrafiuoroethane. Particularly it relates to the preparation of HFC-134 a using a novel catalyst.HFC-134a which is used as replacement for some chlorofluorocarbons in refrigeration and air conditioning  industry.<br>
It is known in the art that the catalytic vapor phase fluorination of haloalkanes with hydrogen fluoride results in the formation of fluorine rich haloalkanes. Aluminium fluoride is one of the catalysts known in the art for the halogen exchange. However a suitable catalyst is required for the fluorination of 2-chloro-1, 1,1,-trifluoroethane (HCFC-133a) to give HFC-134a.<br>
A US Patent 2,885,427 (1959) has found CrF3.3H2O as a suitable catalyst for the fluorination of haloalkanes and haloalkenes. CrF3.3H2O is only a precatalyst , which is oxygenated at 600°C to obtain an active catalyst<br>
whose empirical formula was found to be CrO3F2. The reaction of trichloroethylene with HF in vapor phase at 350°C using the above catalyst gave HCFC-133a as the major component and HFC-134a as a minor component.<br>
It is known in the art that the ease of replacement of chlorine bound to a<br>
carbon, by fluorine follows the order trihalide (-CX3)&gt; dihalide    (-CHX2)   &gt;<br>
primary halide (-CH2X) where X = CI. However the replacement of the primary halide present in   HCFC-133a requires      an efficient catalyst and relatively<br>
higher temperature to get good conversions and high selectivity, which are important for commercial preparation. An UK Patent GB 2,030,981  A   (1979)<br>
reported the fluorination of HCFC-133a at 400°C using CrF3.3H2O as precatalyst. The catalyst was activated by treatment first with air and then with a mixture of HF and air. After activation and during the initial period of fluorination, HCFC-133a and HF were passed in a mole ratio of 1:6 over the catalyst to obtain 31% conversion and 98% selectivity for HFC-134a. Subsequently the reaction was continued by introducing additionally air during which time both conversion and selectivity started falling gradually.<br>
The discovery of oxygenated CrF3.3H2O as a precatalyst lead to the development of several new catalysts based on the oxides of chromium, nickel, cobalt, aluminium etc., The US patents 4,129,603 and 4,158,675 claim a highest conversion of 18.2% in the fluorir»fon using^^*^ HF: HCFC-133a in mole ratio 3:1. at a reaction temperature in the range 339°-355° C and atmospheric pressure. The selectivity for HFC-134a was 91%. There have been further modifications in the preparation of the precatalyst based on chromium hydroxide. The European Patent 0514932 (1992) described the preparation of Cr(OH)3 from Cr(NO3)3 with different surface areas in the range 48-180 m 2/g and used graphite as an additive. TNs catalyst gave a maximum conversion of 20.3% with a selectivity of 95.7% for HFC-134a using HF:HCFC-133a in mole ratio 4.6:1. at a reaction temperature of 330° G and a space velocity of 2250/h. The EP 0546883 (19j32Jjej&gt;orted the jfeparation of chromia with or without Ni compound using sol gel technique. The addition of nickel compound has improved the life of the catalyst.<br>
The patents 0486333 Ai (1991) and EP 0554165 Al (1993) reported a catalyst containing chromia/nickel salt impregnated on partially fluorinated alumina or AIF3. The fluorination of HCFC-133a was carried out under pressure and in the presence of oxygen, to give HFC-134a with a maximum conversion of 21% and 99% selectivity. The EP 0641598 A2( 1994) discloses a process for the fluorination      catalyst    by firing Cr (III) hydroxide in hydrogen<br>
atmosphere. The catalyst obtained was crystalline Cr2O3. Using a mote ratio of HF: 133a 8:1 a<br>
conversion of 19.8% HCFC-133a and 99.3% selectivity for HFC-134a was obtained.<br>
The US patent 4792643 (1988) report the preparation of different catalysts by impregnation of CrO3, TiCU. CrCI3, CoCb and NiCb on porous activated  alumina.   These<br>
catalysts were used to obtain directly HFC-134a  by fluorination of TCE.   The selectivity for<br>
HFC-134a was very low.<br>
The US patent 5155082 (1992) disclosed a catalyst prepared by blending Al (OH)3 and chromium oxide in the presence of a solvent. The fluorination of HCFC-133a was reported to give 18% conversion with 94% selectivity for HFC-134 a. The EP 0328127 Al (1989) reports the use of a catalyst obtained by impregnation of compounds of Co, Mn, Ni, pd, Ag and Ru on alumina or AIOF as a precatalyst for the fluorination of HCFC-133a. The catalyst obtained from CoCl/Al2O3 gave conversion of 33.5% with selectivity 93.7% for HFC-134a in the fluorination of HCFC-133a using HF containing ppm levels of oxygen. The above catalyst has been further modified in Indian Patent 172054 (1989) by using additives selected from compounds of metals having atomic number 58-71. At temperature above 350°C and using HF: HCFC-133a in mole ratio in the range 10:1 to 20:1, conversions in the range 30-40% were obtained. At higher temperatures the conversions were higher but the selectivity dropped to 82.9%. The patents WO 92/16480 (1992) and WO 92/16481 (1992) disclosed a new catalyst prepared by impregnation of zinc compound on Al2O3 and optionally containing one or more other metals selected from this group with atomic number 57-71. This catalyst gave very high selectivity for HFC-13a. The use of compounds of zinc and/or magnesium as promoters on chromium based catalyst impregnated on alumina or AIF3 was reported in the EP 0502605 Al (1992) for the fluorination using HF: HCFC-133a in mole ratio 3.5:1 at reaction temperature of 330°C and contact time 2s.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a process of preparation of HFC-134a by fluorination of HCFC-133a using a novel catalyst. Another object of the invention is to reduce the relative percentage of strong acid sites in the catalyst in order to achieve high selectivity. Yet another objective is to provide enough crushing strength to the catalyst for use under pressure.<br>
Accordingly the present invention relates to a process for the preparation of 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane which comprises; contacting in the gas phase a feed consisting of 2-chloro-l,l,l-trifluoroethane and hydrogen fluoride, characterized in that with a co-precipitated chromia-alumina catalyst impregnated with a zinc compound at a temperature of 275 - 400°C optionally under pressure, and recovering 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane in a conventional manner from the product stream.<br>
The co-precipitated chromia-alumina catalyst may contain choromium: aluminum in the atomic ratio of 1:1 to 1:14.<br>
The amount of zinc compound used for impregnation of co-precipitated chromia-alumina catalyst may range from 2-12% by weight.<br>
The mole ratio of anhydrous hydrogen fluoride and 2-chloro-l,l,l-trifluoroethane may be in the range of 4:1 to 15:1.<br>
The ratio of the catalyst to feed (W/F) may be in the range of 80 to 150 g.h./mole. The contacting may be carried out in the pressure range of 150-210 psig.<br>
DETAILS OF THE INVENTION<br>
A commercial process for HFC-134a uses HCFC-133a and anhydrous hydrogen fluoride as raw materials. The process can be carried out both at atmospheric pressure and under pressure. The process under pressure has the advantage of directly feeding the product stream into distillation columns operating under pressure for the separation of the desired product and byproducts and to recover and recycle the unreacted starting materials and intermediates. The factors that influence the conversions and selectivity are given below:<br>
1.	The precatalyst and its activation with HF.<br>
2.	Mole ratio of HF:HCFC-133a<br>
3.	Reaction temperature<br>
4.	The ratio of weight of the catalyst to the number moles per hour in the feed expressed as w/F g.h/mole.<br>
5.	Pressure.<br>
The catalyticaliy activity in the halogen exchange has been attributed to the Lewis acid sites.In the case of chromia based catalyst the activity was attributed to the number of reversibly oxidizable sites in the precatalyst.In the alumina-based catalyst the formation of Q&gt;-<br>
AIF3 during activation is critical to the catafytcal activity. The catalyst based on chromia atone was found quite efficient in fiuorinalion at atmospheric pressures. Under pressure this catalyst exhibited a fall in the conversions and selectivity. Also volatile compounds are generated that condense at the reactor exit causing blockage, a serious draw back for commercial operation. The use of graphite to increase the strengtfi of the catalyst resulted in a loss in adivity.<br>
This invention takes advantage of the catalytical activity of both chromia and alumina and reports the preparation of a co-precipitated catalyst starting from salts of Cr3* and Al (NO3) 3 The relative atomic ratios of Cr: Al can be in the range 1:1 to 1:14 preferably in the range 1:3 to 1:10 and most preferably in tie range 1:3 to 1:5. The co-precipitation is done by using a "base selected from NaOH, KOH and NH4OH, preferably with NH4OH. The precipitation is carried out at various dilutions using the base of strength 1 to 6 molar, preferably 4-6 molar. The quantity of water used to dissolve the combined quantity of chromium (III) salt and aluminium nitrate are in foe weight ratio 38:1 to 4:1 preferably 19:1 to 4:1 and most preferably 10:1 to 4:1.<br>
The precipitation of metal trihydroxides are completed by adjusting the final pH in the range of 7-8 and filtered, washed with water and dried to constant weight at a temperature in the range 70-150 deg.C, preferably in the range 70-120 deg.C. The dried catalyst is powdered and shaped into tablets or extrudes and calcined in nitrogen atmosphere at a temperature in the range 350-400 deg.C, preferably in the range 380-400 deg.C for 24 to 48 hours. The calcined catalyst was activated by treating sequentially with N2 at 400 deg.C for 24 hours followed by fluorination in the temperature range 150-400 deg.C till the exit stream of HF contains less than 1 % of moisture.<br>
The process also economises on the use of the Cr compound as raw material for the preparation of the catalyst thus minimising the cost and problems related to effluent disposal of the spent catalyst It was found that the performance of the co-precipitated Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalyst can be further improved by reducing the total acidity by impregnation or deposition with a compound<br>
of zinc The addition of zinc compound results in suppressing the formation of 2-chtoro-l,1,l,2-tetrafluoroethane (HCFC-124), pentafluoroethane (HFC-125) and 1,1,1-trifluoroethane (HFC-143a) in the fluorination of HCFC-133a. The addition of a zinc compound on Cr2O3/Al2O3 reduced the percentage of strong acid centers relative to the weak and medium acid centers as revealed by TPD of ammonia. The quantity of zinc compound taken is to give a zinc content of 2 - 12%, preferably in the range 3-7% by weight of co-precipitated Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalyst. In the fluorination of HCFC-133a to HFC-134a the mole ratio of HF: HCFC-133a should be in the range 4:1 to 15:1, preferably in the range 6:1 to 10:1. The degree of conversion and selectivity depends on the residence time, which determines the W/F value. It was found that the preferred W/F value is in the range 80-150, most preferably in the range 100 -150.<br>
Pressure was found to have an effect in the fluorination of HCFC-133a to HFC-134a. Under the same set of conditions of temperature, mole ratio ard W/F toe conversions were higher, at atmospheric pressure compared to the reaction under pressure. It was found advantageous to carry out the fluorination under pressure keeping in view the separation of different components in the product mixture. The required pressure was found to be in the range 70-210 psig. It was found that the fluorination of HCFC-133a can be carried out in the temperature range 275 ° -400 ° C and preferably in the range of 300 ° - 375 °C to obtain good conversions and selectivity to the desired product. The preparation of the precatalyst, its activation and use in the fluorination of HCFC-133a to give HFC-134a is illustrated in the examples given below:<br>

General method of fluorination: The experimental set up consists of separate feed ines for HF and HCFC-133a, vaporiser and a 90 cm long 1" id. inconel tubular reactor, pressure relief trap, alkali scrubber, drier, condenser and a receiver cooled in dry ice acetone mixture. A sample of the product stream is drawn periodically from a sampling valve between the drier and condenser. The temperatures in different zones are maintained by electrically heated block furnaces and PID controllers. The catalyst is loaded into the tubular reactor and pretreated with nitrogen at 400c C for 24 h. The temperature is then lowered to 150° C and a slow stream of HF is introduced along with nitrogen. After the initial exothermicity nitrogen is slowly withdrawn while raising the temperature of the catalyst bed to 375 ° C. The fluorination is continued until the moisture content in the exit HF is below 1%. The bed temperature of the catalyst is then brought and maintained at the reaction temperature and HCFC-133a is introduced into the system along with HF The feed quantity of HF and HCFC-133a were adjusted to give the desired molar ratios and W/F. The product stream is scrubbed with aq. KOH solution and then condensed in a<br>
trap cooled in dry .ice acetone. The composition of the product sfream is determined by GC after reaching steady state and is based on the peak areas. The fluorination experiments were carried out both at atmospheric pressure and under pressure as indicated in the examples given<br>

The advantage of the co-precipitated chromia-alumina catalyst impregnated with zinc lies in the economisation of relatively costly chromium salt as compared to bulk chromia. The co-precipitated catalyst exhibits longer life and higher crushing strength as compared to an impregnated chromia-alumina catalyst used in fluorination reactions. The impregnation of the co-precipitated chromia-alumina catalyst with zinc reduces the relative percentage of strong acid sites which are responsible for the formation of side products like HFC-125, HFC-143a and HCFC-1122 thus increasing selectivity for HFC-134a.<br><br><br><br><br>
