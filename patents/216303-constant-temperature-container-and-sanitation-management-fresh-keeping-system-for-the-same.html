CONSTANT TEMPERATURE CONTAINER AND SANITATION MANAGEMENT /<br>
FRESH-KEEPING SYSTEM FOR THE SAME<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to constant temperature containers having a<br>
downward-blowing refrigeration cycle and more specifically to constant temperature<br>
containers having an ozone generator and an anion generator.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
A constant temperature container, generally referred to as a cooling container,<br>
represses the bio-activities (respiration and the like) of perishables by keeping the<br>
temperature inside the container constant, to keep the perishables fresh for a long time.<br>
However, even if the temperature inside the container is kept constant (at a low temperature<br>
of 5Â°C or the like, for example), spoilage of the perishables proceeds due to fungi (molds<br>
and bacteria) that propagate at low temperature and putrid odor due to the propagation of the<br>
fungi adheres to the perishables.<br>
Furthermore, depending on the kind of the perishables, ethylene gas is generated<br>
and the freshness further deteriorates due to the ethylene gas generated by the perishables<br>
themselves. As a conventional counter-measure, the deterioration of the freshness is<br>
repressed by storing ethylene gas adsorbents in the container. However, the ethylene gas<br>
adsorbents need to be removed and replaced with fresh new adsorbents for every transport<br>
of the perishables. Furthermore, there was the problem that when failing to replace the<br>
ethylene gas adsorbents and the adsorbents are used in the subsequent transport, the bag<br>
holding the adsorbents may be ripped open and the adsorbents in the form of beads may be<br>
scattered all over the floor of the container.<br>
Recently, a perishables preserving and distributing device in which a constant<br>
temperature container is equipped with an ozone generator and an anion generator has been<br>
proposed (see Japanese Patent Application Publication Kokai No. 2002-68422) for the<br>
sanitation management of perishables and as a means for keeping them fresh.<br>
Ozone oxidizes by adsorbing to dusts, fungi, and the like that drift in the air or that<br>
adhere to the perishables and the walls and sterilizes by decomposing. However, since the<br>
ozone does not have an electric charge, even if there are metal plates in the vicinity, the<br>
ozone is not influenced by these.<br>
On the other hand, while anions spread in space by repelling each other, anions are<br>
rapidly depleted when they pass through a narrow space. Also, an effective sterilization<br>
cannot be implemented because anions are adsorbed when they come close to metal plates<br>
or the like.<br>
Therefore, it is necessary to consider these properties when installing the ozone<br>
generator and the anion generator. However, these points are not considered at all in the<br>
conventional perishables preserving and distributing device described above, and the ozone<br>
generator and the anion generator are integrated into one unit and are installed in the same<br>
place (the ceiling of the container). For this reason, it cannot be said that the properties of<br>
each device are fully utilized and there is the problem that adequate sterilization cannot be<br>
expected.<br>
The present invention has been devised to solve these problems and it is an object<br>
of the present invention to provide a constant temperature container that makes full use of<br>
the properties of the ozone generator and the anion generator by arranging them with<br>
sufficient consideration of their properties.<br>
A constant temperature container according to the present invention has an ozone<br>
generator and an anion generator in a storage space, wherein the anion generators is installed<br>
on a ceiling portion in the storage space which has a downward-blowing type refrigeration<br>
unit, the anion generator being installed at a location that is removed from the refrigeration<br>
unit and the ozone generator is installed on the ceiling portion in the storage space, the<br>
ozone generator being close to the refrigeration unit.<br>
According to the present invention having such characteristics, the anion generator<br>
is installed on the ceiling portion in a storage space having a downward-blowing<br>
refrigeration unit, at a location that is removed from the refrigeration unit. Specifically, the<br>
anion generator is installed in the space between the ceiling and the cargo, which is the<br>
maximum space when the cargo (perishables) is loaded, and in the position opposite to a<br>
suction port of the refrigeration unit. Because anions have a spatial diffusion property of<br>
spreading in space by repelling each other, the anions effectively sterilize as they are<br>
diffused throughout the space above the perishables that are loaded. On the other hand,<br>
metal plates that adsorb and extinguish the anions are used in a portion of a heat exchanger<br>
of the refrigeration unit inside the storage space. For that reason, in the present invention,<br>
the anion generator is installed at a location that is removed from the refrigeration unit.<br>
Thus, it is possible to prolong the effect of the sterilization of the anions.<br>
On the other hand, because ozone does not have an electrical charge, the ozone is<br>
not influenced by metal plates in its vicinity and acts on dust, fungi, and the like that drift in<br>
the air and fungi and the like that adhere to the walls and the perishables. Therefore,<br>
installing the ozone generator close to the refrigeration unit, it is possible to make full use of<br>
the properties of the ozone generator.<br>
As for specific installation positions, when the refrigeration unit is installed in the<br>
innermost portion, on the side opposite of the door of the storage space, then the ozone<br>
generator is installed on the ceiling portion close to the refrigeration unit and the anion<br>
generator is installed on the ceiling portion close to the door.<br>
In this case, the ozone generator should be installed close to the upper suction port<br>
of the refrigeration unit. Due to its structure, in the downward-blowing type refrigeration<br>
unit, dust and bacteria tend to accumulate more on the downstream side of the refrigeration<br>
unit, such as inside the heat exchanger or at the air blow-out port, than on the upstream side<br>
of the refrigeration unit, such as at the air suction port. Also, the moisture in the air<br>
condenses and the air is damp. For that reason, by installing the ozone generator close to<br>
the suction port of the refrigeration unit, highly concentrated ozone is immediately absorbed<br>
into the refrigeration unit from the suction port, so that the ozone can act on the bacteria<br>
propagating in the vicinity of the blow-out port on the downstream side and sterilize them.<br>
In other words, it is possible to directly apply the highly concentrated ozone to the<br>
refrigeration unit. Thus, it is possible to prevent the contamination of the cargo (the<br>
perishables) by the fungi inside the refrigeration unit.<br>
Furthermore, the anion generator is embedded in the ceiling portion of the storage<br>
space. Thus, when the door is opened and the perishables are loaded and unloaded, the<br>
anion generator does not obstruct the loading and unloading.<br>
Also, when the constant temperature container has a generator engine unit driving<br>
the refrigeration unit, an AC power source of the generator engine unit is used without<br>
change as the power source for the ozone generator and the anion generator. In the case of<br>
conventional cooling containers, both the transport vehicle and the cooling container are<br>
equipped with only a DC power source. Therefore, it is necessary to use a separate<br>
DC/AC converter to use the ozone generator and the anion generator. However, when the<br>
container has a generator engine unit that drives the refrigeration unit, it is possible to<br>
eliminate the need to additionally install such an unnecessary device.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS<br>
FIG. 1 is a diagrammatic cross-sectional view seen from the side, showing the<br>
overall arrangement of a constant temperature container of the present invention.<br>
BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
 Below, an embodiment of the present invention is explained with reference to the<br>
drawing.<br>
FIG. 1 is a diagrammatic cross-sectional view seen from the side, showing the<br>
overall arrangement of a constant temperature container of the present invention.<br>
The constant temperature container 1 of the present embodiment is provided with a<br>
door 11 on a rear side (opposite the driver seat) in a storage space 10, for example and a<br>
cargo A of perishables or the like is loaded or unloaded therefrom. Also, a refrigeration<br>
unit 12 is installed in the innermost portion (behind the driver) in the storage space 10.<br>
Furthermore, the refrigeration unit 12 is a downward-blowing type unit in the<br>
present embodiment. That is, the refrigeration unit 12 is provided with an air suction port<br>
13 on the upper side and an air blow-off port 14 on the lower side. Also, a cooling fan 15 is<br>
placed below and close to the suction port 13 and a heat exchanger 16 is placed below and<br>
close to the cooling fan 15.<br>
Cold air blown off from the blow-off port 14 flows from the deep end inside the<br>
storage space toward the door 11, passing between rails 21 that are arranged in multiple<br>
rows so that the cargo A that is loaded inside the storage space 10 does not touch the floor.<br>
At some points in the flow, the cold air moves upward between the cargos A that are loaded<br>
on the rails 21, and passes through a space 23 between the uppermost cargo A and the<br>
ceiling 22 inside the storage space 10 toward the deep end of the storage space. In other<br>
words, the cold air flows toward the suction port 13 of the refrigeration unit 12.<br>
In this configuration of the present embodiment, the ozone generator 30 is placed<br>
on the ceiling 22 inside the storage space 10 directly opposite to the suction port 13 of the<br>
refrigeration unit 12 and the anion generator 40 is placed on the ceiling 22 near the door 11.<br>
Thus, the ozone generated from the ozone generator 30 is immediately sucked into<br>
the refrigeration unit 12 from the suction port 13 at a high concentration and passes through<br>
the heat exchanger 16, thus acting on and sterilizing the bacteria propagating in the vicinity<br>
of the blow-off port 14 downstream.<br>
Also, anions generated from the anion generator 40 spread by diffusing through the<br>
space 23 above the loaded cargo A. After effectively sterilizing the dust and the fungi that<br>
float in that space, the anions are depleted by being sucked in through the suction port 13 of<br>
the refrigeration unit 12.<br>
It should be noted that, in FIG. 1, the anion generator 40 is attached so that it<br>
protrudes downward from the ceiling 22 of the storage space 10, but it is better that the<br>
anion generator 40 is embedded inside the ceiling 22 so that the anion generator 40 does not<br>
obstruct the opening and closing of the door 11 and the loading and unloading of the cargo<br>
A.<br>
Furthermore, in the constant temperature container 1 of the present embodiment, a<br>
generator engine unit 50 is installed as the power source for driving the refrigeration unit 12.<br>
Therefore, it is possible to use an AC power source of the generator engine unit 50 without<br>
change as the power source for the ozone generator 30 and the anion generator 40.<br>
Also, in the present embodiment, the present invention is applied to a constant<br>
temperature container having a downward-blowing refrigeration unit. But it is possible to<br>
apply the present invention to constant temperature containers having an upward-blowing<br>
refrigeration unit (in which the flow of air is entirely opposite to the downward-blowing<br>
type). In this case, it is preferable to mount the ozone generator and the anion generator on<br>
the floor of the storage space 10 in order to make maximum use of their properties, but it is<br>
also possible to mount them to the ceiling.<br>
The present invention can be embodied and practiced in other different forms<br>
without departing from the spirit and essential characteristics thereof. Therefore, the<br>
above-described embodiments are considered in all respects as illustrative and not<br>
restrictive. The scope of the invention is indicated by the appended claims rather than by<br>
the foregoing description. All variations and modifications falling within the range of<br>
equivalents of the appended claims are intended to be embraced therein.<br>
It should be noted that the present application is based on Patent Application No.<br>
2002-212378 filed in Japan, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
Furthermore, the entire content of the documents cited in the present specification is hereby<br>
