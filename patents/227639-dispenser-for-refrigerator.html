				<td>DISPENSER FOR REFRIGERATOR<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a refrigerator, and more particularly, to a<br>
dispenser for a refrigerator, which is installed inside the refrigerator to provide a<br>
user with drinking water.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
First, a general refrigerator and a dispenser installed therein will be described<br>
with reference to FIG. 1.<br>
As shown in FIG. 1, water supplied from a water supply source such as a<br>
tap is filtrated at a filtration unit 1 through a pipe Pa, and then is supplied to a<br>
valve 2 connected to the filtration unit 1.<br>
The valve 2 has two discharging holes through which water is selectively<br>
blown. One discharging hole of the valve 2 supplies water to an ice machine 6<br>
through a pipe Pc, and the other discharging hole supplies water to a reservoir 3<br>
through a pipe Pd. Accordingly, a constant level of water is always stored in the<br>
reservoir 3, and it can be supplied to a discharging part 5 through a pipe Pe.<br>
Here, the reservoir 3 is generally installed inside the cold-storage room so as to<br>
cool the stored water, and the discharging device 5 is installed, for instance, in<br>
front of a door 4 (ex, the door of the freezer). This dispenser allows a user to be<br>
given fresh water from the refrigerator.<br>
This general refrigerator, however, has the following drawbacks.<br><br>
Since the reservoir 3 is installed inside the cold-storage room, usage<br>
space inside the cold-storage room substantially decreases as much.<br>
Also, since the reservoir 3 and the discharging device 5 are separated<br>
from each other, the pipe Pe connected between them should be extended long,<br>
and a part of the pipe Pe is indispensably placed outside the refrigerator.<br>
Accordingly, temperature of the water stored in that portion is substantially the<br>
same as that of the outside air in that portion that is higher than the temperature<br>
of the interior of the cold-storage room. As a result, if a user discharges water<br>
through the discharging device 5 at an initial stage, the water stored in a part of<br>
the pipe Pe at the room temperature is discharged instead of cold water stored in<br>
the reservoir 3.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, the present invention is directed to a dispenser for a<br>
refrigerator that substantially obviates one or more of the problems due to<br>
limitations and disadvantages of the related art.<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a refrigerator and a<br>
dispenser for a refrigerator in which the inner space of the refrigerator does not<br>
decrease.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a refrigerator and a<br>
dispenser for a refrigerator capable of directly discharging cold water.<br>
Additional features and advantages of the invention will be set forth in the<br>
description which follows, and in part will be apparent from the description, or<br><br>
may be learned by practice of the invention. The objectives and other<br>
advantages of the invention will be realized and attained by the structure<br>
particularly pointed out in the written description and claims thereof as well as<br>
appended drawings.<br>
To achieve these and other advantages and in accordance with the<br>
purpose of the present invention, as embodied and broadly described, there is<br>
provided a dispenser for a refrigerator. The dispenser includes : a first pipe<br>
connected with a water supply source ; a reservoir installed inside a door of the<br>
refrigerator and connected with the first pipe, for temporarily storing water<br>
supplied from the water supply source ; a second pipe connected with the<br>
reservoir; and a discharging device installed in the door of the refrigerator and<br>
connected with the second pipe, for discharging the water supplied from the<br>
reservoir depending on a user's necessity.<br>
The reservoir is installed inside a door of a freezer, preferably, the<br>
reservoir is buried in an heat insulation layer disposed within the door of the<br>
freezer, and more preferably, the reservoir is installed in the vicinity of the front<br>
side of the door of the freezer.<br>
Alternatively, the reservoir is installed in the vicinity of the discharging<br>
device, and preferably installed right after the discharging device.<br>
The discharging device is installed in a door of a freezer of the<br>
refrigerator, and preferably installed right before the reservoir.<br><br>
Also, the second pipe is installed inside a door of a freezer of the<br>
refrigerator and is buried in a heat insulation layer, and preferably installed in the<br>
vicinity of the front side of the door of the freezer.<br>
Likewise, the first pipe is partially installed inside a door of the freezer of<br>
the refrigerator and is buried in a heat insulation layer, and preferably partially<br>
installed in the vicinity of the front side of the door of the freezer.<br>
According to the aforementioned present invention, the reservoir is<br>
installed inside the door, thereby enhancing the efficiency in use of the inner<br>
space of a refrigerator, and providing convenience in that the water discharged<br>
from the reservoir is always supplied at a cold status.<br>
It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the<br>
following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory and are intended to<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred<br>
embodiments of the present invention, examples of which<br>
are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Wherever<br>
possible, the same reference numbers will be used<br>
throughout the drawings to refer to the same or like parts.<br>
FIG. 2 is a perspective view schematically showing a<br>
refrigerator according to the present invention, and FIG.<br>
3 is a longitudinal sectional view of a door in which a<br>
dispenser according to the present invention is installed.<br>
As shown in FIGs. 2 and 3, a refrigerator of the<br>
present invention basically includes cold-storage room and<br>
freezer 10 and 20 formed inside a main body, and cold-<br>
storage room door 30 and freezer door 40. Also, the<br>
refrigerator may further include disperser 50, and ice<br>
machine 60 for the purpose of providing, an additional<br>
function, e.g., for providing drinking water or ice.<br>
Here, since, the cold-storage room/freezer 10/20, the<br>
doors 30 and 40, and the ice machine 60 are the same in<br><br>
construction as those of the general refrigerator, their description is omitted, and<br>
only the dispenser is described in more detail.<br>
The dispenser 60 according to the present invention includes a supply<br>
part for supplying drinking water from a water supply source to the interior of the<br>
refrigerator, and a discharging device 54 discharging the supplied water from the<br>
supply part according to a user's need.<br>
The supply part includes a first pipe 51 connected with the water supply<br>
source, a reservoir 52 connected with the first pipe 51, and a second pipe 53<br>
connecting the reservoir 52 and the discharging device 54. Also, in case the ice<br>
machine 60 is installed at the refrigerator, a valve 55 for controlling water supply<br>
is installed on the first pipe 51, and a third pipe 56 is branched from the valve 55<br>
and extended to the ice machine 60 so as to supply water to the ice machine 60.<br>
In more detail, the reservoir 52 plays a role in temporarily storing the water<br>
supplied through the first pipe 51. Preferably, the reservoir 52 is, as shown in<br>
FIG. 3, disposed not at the cold-storage room but at the interior of the doors 30<br>
and 40 of the refrigerator. Accordingly, when compared with the conventional<br>
refrigerator, the inner space of the refrigerator, e.g., the cold-storage room of the<br>
invention does not decrease unnecessarily. Meanwhile, since the reservoir 52 is<br>
located inside the doors 30 and 40, the drinking water in the reservoir 52 is<br>
indirectly cooled differently from that in the conventional reservoir installed at the<br>
cold-storage room. In other words, the drinking water in the reservoir 52 is<br>
cooled by cool air transferred through the corresponding doors 30 and 40 from<br>
the cold-storage room 10 or the freezer. Accordingly, for the rapid cooling of the<br><br>
drinking water contained in the reservoir 52, it is more desirous that the reservoir<br>
52 is located inside the freezer door 40 rather than inside the cold-storage room<br>
door 30. Also, the reservoir 52 is substantially buried in a heat insulation layer<br>
40a filled in the freezer door 40. Accordingly, although the cool air of the freezer<br>
20 can be transferred to the reservoir 52, the water is not frozen due to the<br>
existence of the heat insulation layer 40a. Simultaneously, since heat of room<br>
temperature is transferred to the reservoir through a surface of the door opposite<br>
to a surface contacting the freezer 20, e.g., the front surface of the freezer door<br>
40, it is possible that the reservoir 52 always stores cold water. Further, the<br>
reservoir 52 is preferably installed in the vicinity of the front surface of the door<br>
contacting the outside. This is because the reservoir 52 may be less influenced<br>
by the cool air of the freezer 20 and thus freezing of the water in the reservoir 52<br>
can be securely prevented while the stored drinking water is cooled.<br>
In the meanwhile, a constant amount of water stays in the pipe connecting<br>
the reservoir 52 and the discharging device 54, e.g., the second pipe 53. In<br>
other words, as the second pipe 53 is lengthened, the amount of the water<br>
staying in the second pipe 53 increases, so that it becomes difficult to provide<br>
fresh water to a user, and sanitary problem may be caused. Resultantly, in order<br>
to make the second pipe as short as possible, the reservoir 52 should be<br>
installed nearer the discharging device 54 if possible. Here, since the reservoir<br>
52 is placed within the door 40, the reservoir 52 is, as shown in FIG. 3, placed<br>
right after the discharging device 54, so that the length of the second pipe 53<br>
becomes substantially shortest. Accordingly, the short second pipe 53 allows a<br><br>
user to be directly supplied with fresh water, and the sanitary problem is also<br>
resolved.<br>
As shown in FIG. 3 in more detail, the discharging device 54 includes a<br>
cavity formed at the front side of the refrigerator door so as to stably<br>
accommodate a container for drinking water, such as a cup, and a nozzle<br>
connected to the second pipe 53, for discharging drinking water. And, as<br>
aforementioned, in order to shorten the second pipe if possible, the discharging<br>
device 54 is installed adjacent to the reservoir 52 at the front side of the freezer<br>
door 40. More preferably, in order to minimize the length of the second pipe 53,<br>
the discharging device 54 is installed right before the reservoir 52.<br>
In addition, since the second pipe 52 also connects the reservoir 52 and<br>
the discharging device 54, it is installed buried in the heat insulation layer 40a.<br>
The second pipe 53 is, as shown in FIG. 3, installed adjacent to the front side of<br>
the freezer door 50, which is to prevent the water in the second pipe 53 from<br>
being frozen by the cool air of the freezer 20.<br>
Similarly to the second pipe 53, the first pipe 51 is also partially buried in<br>
the heat insulation layer 40a inside the freezer door 40 so as to be connected to<br>
the reservoir 52. Also, in order to prevent the water in the first pipe 51 from<br>
being frozen, a part of the first pipe 51 is installed adjacent to the front side of<br>
the freezer door 40. Meanwhile, in case the reservoir 52 is located within the<br>
cold-storage room 10 like the conventional refrigerator (refer to FIG. 1), the first<br>
pipe 51 has to have a distant roundabout path inside the refrigerator so<br>
as to connect the reservoir 52 and the discharging device 54, so that it is<br><br>
unnecessarily lengthened. However, since the reservoir 52 is located inside the<br>
freezer door 40, the first pipe is, as shown in FIG. 2, connected directly to the<br>
discharging device 54 from the water supply source, so that the length of the first<br>
pipe 51 is shortened. Resultantly, the dispenser of the present invention is more<br>
simplified.<br>
Operation of the dispenser for a refrigerator according to the present<br>
invention will be now described.<br>
If a user is discharged with water from the dispenser (for instance, by<br>
pushing a water discharging button), the drinking water of the water supply<br>
source is introduced into the valve 55 via a filtration unit (not shown). The<br>
introduced water is branched into two pipes 51 and 56 at the valve 55. The<br>
water passing through the first pipe 51 is supplied to the discharging device 54,<br>
and the water passing through the second pipe 56 is supplied to the ice machine<br>
60. Here, before the water is supplied through the discharging device 54, a<br>
certain amount of water is stored in the reservoir 52, and is properly cooled by<br>
the cool air through freezer door 40. Thus, since the water is discharged through<br>
the minimized second pipe 53 during supply to the user, the water is in the most<br>
fresh and cool status.<br>
While the present invention has been described and illustrated herein with<br>
reference to the preferred embodiments thereof, it will be apparent to those<br>
skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made therein<br>
without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Thus, it is<br>
intended that the present invention covers the modifications and variations of this<br><br>
invention that come within the scope of the appended claims and their<br>
equivalents.<br>
INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY<br>
According to the aforementioned invention, the following effects are<br>
anticipated.<br>
First, since the reservoir is installed inside the freezer door in the<br>
dispenser of the present invention, the inner space of the refrigerator is not<br>
occupied unnecessarily. Accordingly, it becomes substantially possible to<br>
effectively use the inner space of the refrigerator.<br>
Also, since the passage from the reservoir to the discharging part is very<br>
short, it becomes possible to maintain the water discharged from the discharging<br>
device at fresh and cool status, so that use of the dispenser becomes<br>
convenient.<br>
Further, since the reservoir is located inside the door, an overall extending<br>
length of the pipe is substantially shortened. Accordingly, decrease in the<br>
number of elements and enhancement in the productivity are anticipated when<br>
the present invention is applied to the fabrication of the dispenser and the<br>
refrigerator including the dispenser.<br><br>
