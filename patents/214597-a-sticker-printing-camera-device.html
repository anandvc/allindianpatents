The "stickercam" 1 as illustrated in the accompanying figures has a multi-part housing defined by an external front cover moulding 2, an internal sub-structure and rear molding 3, a sticker and ink cartridge molding 4 and an external rear cover 5.<br>
The housing in the illustrated preferred form is generally tear-drop shaped in elevation, the generally circular portion 6 being adapted to store stickers in a printroll form and the remaining portion housing the ink supply 7, printhead arrangement 8 and sticker feed mechanism 9.<br>
The view finder 10 is also disposed at or near the centre of the circular housing portion 6 and extends fully through the casing from the front cover 2 to an optional eye piece 11 on the rear. Provided immediately below the view finder 10 at the front of the casing is a camera lens 12 which is: operatively associated with the suitable image sensing and processing means such as the CCD 13 shown in figure 12. Further, a "take" button 14 is provided at the top of the casing together with a "print" button 15 for taking and printing images respectively.<br>
The preferred "stickercam" as illustrated also includes an "effects dial" 16 which is rotatable so as to implement a series of effects such as normal, black and white, sepia, soft blending, etc. It can also be used for the addition of graphical clip arts such as love hearts, flowers, surprise effects etc. On the dial, a series of icon pictures may be provided on which is printed an indicator of the effect The effect placed at the indicator marker 17 is the one then applied by the camera. The effect dial can be implemented by placing a series of conductive segments on the reverse side of the wheel with the conductive segments forming a binary pattern indicative of the type of effect to be displayed. The segments can complete a circuit monitorable by the stickercam so as to provide for the effect<br>
In the preferred form, the stickers are provided in the form of a sticker roll18 which is preferably housed in a cartridge assembly 19 which is releasably secured to the external casing. The cartridge is of a similar shape and structure to the external housing and comprises a top molding 20 which defines a generally annular sticker roll<br>
containing portion 21 with a generally triangular sectioned ink storage section 22. The ink storage section is preferably divided into a plurality of distinct chambers 23 so as to provide for both colour and black and white printing. Two slots are also provided in the side wall of the cartridge top molding, the first being a sticker exit slot 24 and<br>
h,<br>
the second being a pick up roller slot 25 which forms part of the sticker feed mechanism 27 that is described in more detail below. The cartridge ] 9 also includes a base molding 28 which seals both the sticker roll cavity and the ink chambers. Preferably, ink outlet perforations 29 are provided in the base molding that are covered by a sealing film that is pierced during installation so as to be in fluid communication with a printer mechanism 30. Desirably, the cartridge is a sealed unit such that the stickers and ink supply are to be replenished simultaneously. Conveniently, the cartridge may be snap fitted with the external housing by means of pressure snap mounts 31 shown in the drawings.<br>
The sticker feed mechanism 27 and printer mechanism 30 are best illustrated in figures 2,5,7,9 and 12. The sticker feed mechanism 27 includes a pick up roller 32 which spools the stickers forward once the cartridge has been inserted in the outer housing. Adjacent the pick up roller are several pairs of drive rollers or nip rollers 33 which are operated via an appropriate gear chain 34 by the motor 35. A serrated cutter 36 may also be provided as part of the feed sub-assembly and arranged so as to be adjacent the printed sticker outlet 37 that is formed as part of the housing front molding 2. Alternatively, a guillotine type arrangement could be provided.<br>
The printer mechanism 30 is best shown in figures 6 and 7 and comprises a page width printhead chip 40 with an ink distribution unit 41. Forming part of the ink distribution unit is an ink supply connection manifold 42 which has a plurality of ink inlet projections 43 which engage the ink outlet perforations 29 on the sticker roll and ink cartridge 19. Preferably, the printer mechanism and sticker feed mechanism are a single unit and are detachable for replacement or repair.<br>
Turning now to figure 12 (and figure 5), there is shown a schematic arrangement of a part of the electrical circuitry for the control and operation of the stickercam device. As can be seen, a simple flexible PCB harness can be used to interconnect the take and print buttons 14 and 15 to the CCD 13 and the printhead assembly 30. Also<br>
provided as part of the circuit are contacts 45 for the power supply which is preferably in the form of a three volt battery 46. Further, the detachable printhead and/or sticker and ink supply cartridge preferably include an authentication mechanism such as that outlined in applicant's earlier PCT application number PCT/AU98/00544 entitled "A camera with an internal printing system". The authentication chip contact 47 is shown in figure 12.<br>
In use, the "stickercam" is oriented toward the target subject and the take button 14 is then operated to capture the image. The effects dial 16 can then be rotated and an effect selected. When the print button 15 is then operated the sticker feed mechanism 27 delivers the next sticker or portion of sticker media to the printhead assembly 30 for printing of the effect processed image thereon.<br>
Numerous variations are possible within the overall inventive concept For example, the printhead unit can be a suitable adaptation of that outlined in the Australian provisional patent application entitled "Image Creation Method and Apparatus (ART 79)" filed concurrently herewith by the present applicant, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by cross reference. Alternatively, the preferred embodiment can be implemented as a rearrangement of the system disclosed in PCT Patent Application PCT/AU98/00549 (WO 99/04551) entitled "A Replenisbable One Time Use Camera System" also filed by the present applicant. Advantageously, the image sensor can be of a reduced size to that described in the above referenced PCT application due to the small size of the slickers.<br>
Similarly, the electronics of the stickercam can be based around a CMOS image sensor 19 which also includes processing circuitry-for processing an image and forwarding it to the printhead 12 for printing. The operation of the internal control electronics can be substantially as set out in the aforementioned PCT specification WO 99/04551.<br>
The preferred application of the cartridge according to the second aspect of the invention is to a sticker printing camerarable to print stickers on demand on a replenishable printroll.<br>
In the preferred form of the third aspect of the invention, a small compact printer is provided which is adapted to print on business card sized sheets of paper and which<br>

PP6534 filed on 16 October, 1998 entitled 'Micromechanical device and method (II46a)' assigned to the present applicant and incorporated herein by way of cross reference.<br>
The printer unit 12 further includes rollers 19,20 arranged to firstly withdraw the lowest sheet from the stack 8 in cartridge 5, forward the sheet-across the printhead 30 on demand for printing and eject the sheet from the printer via exit slot 21. The rollers are driven from an electric motor 22 by way of a gear box 23.<br>
The printer is controlled by a printer control chip interconnected between the<br>
PCMCIA interface 2 and the printer unit 12 and this may be incorporated within the printhead at 24 or in a flexible printed circuit board beneath the floor of docking bay 4.<br>
The electronic circuitry to drive the printhead can also include an ASIC (application specific integrated circuit) device which provides for a one-time use of the printer unit 12 before it must be replaced. This circuit, in the form of an 'authentication chip' is preferably similar to that disclosed in international patent application PCT/AU98/00544, also assigned to the present applicant.<br>
The provision of a detachable paper cartridge 5 as a separate item to the printer mechanism 12 allows for ready replenishment of paper supplies.<br>
A portable printer of this type has many different applications including the printing of business cards on demand from an extremely compact and portable device which can be directly engaged with the PC card slot in a lap top or notebook type computer without the use of interconnecting cables or other devices.

In this manner, a print on demand camera system is provided which enables a detachable and multipurpose printer unit to be used to provide photographic prints as required, while also allowing the printer unit to be utilized for other purposes by engagement with other devices via the PCMCIA interface.<br>
hi the preferred embodiment of the fifth aspect of the invention, a printer unit is provided having an overall size and shape adapted to fit within the disk drive bay of a conventional PC. The printer unit uses a system incorporating a pagewidth inkjet printhead, a print controller chip and a consumable ink and paper supply cartridge of the type fully described in international patent application PCT/AU98/00544 entitled 'A camera with an internal printing system' the contents of which are hereby incorporated into this specification by way of cross reference.<br>
The aforementioned PCT application discloses a camera system having an integral printer which utilizes a print roll containing ink and 'paper' or other print media (referred to throughout mis specification as paper) upon which images are printed on demand. In the preferred embodiment of this invention, the image sensing portions of the camera arrangement of international application PCT/AU98/00544 are dispensed with and the print roll and printhead are designed to be incorporated into a printer unit configured to fit within the disk drive bay of a PC.<br>
The printer unit 1 is preferably rotatably mounted to a sub-frame 2 designed for insertion into the disk drive unit of a PC and typically having engagement lugs 3, an eject button 4 and power LED 5. The printer unit has a paper exit slot 6 as can be clearly seen in figure 1.<br>
Figure 30 shows the unit of figure 29-with the printer unit rotated through 90Â° for the insertion of a paper and ink cartridge of the type described in the... aforementioned international patent application. The printer unit is typically rotated by way of an electric motor 7 (figure 32) operating through a gear train 8 to rotate the printer unit between the operational position shown in figure 1 and the loading position shown in figure 30. In the loading position, a loading door 9 may be opened outwardly on hinge 10 as shown in figure 31 to reveal an opening 11 adapted to receive the ink and paper cartridge 12.<br>
The ink and paper cartridge 12 is elongate in shape and adapted to be inserted into the printer unit in a longitudinal direction as will be apparent from figure 31.<br>
Figure 32 shows some of the internal arrangement of the printer unit including flexible PCB's 13 and 14 which connect the electronic cncuitry from a further PCB 15 to a standard connector 16 engageablc with a standard interface in the PC disk drive bay, and the printhead respectively.<br>
The printhead is preferably a pagewidth inkJet printhead as shown at 16 in figure 32 provided with ink from the ink and paper cartridge as set out in international application PCT/AU98/00544. Also visible in figure 32 is the print roll ejector 17.<br>
A cross section through the pagewidth printhead can be seen in figure 7 which clearly shows the print chamber 18, the capping mechanism 19 of the printhead, and the paper cutter 20. Also clearly visible in figure 35 is the print roll door solenoid 21 operable to open and close the print roll door 22.<br>
The vertical cross section in figure 36 clearly shows the print roll bay connector 16, the main printer circuit board 23, the rotatable drum drive motor 7, gears 8 and drum base 9. Figure 36 also shows the ink channels 24 extending between the print roll 12 and the print chamber 18. The paper cutter 20 is driven by a motor drive 25.<br>
Also visible in figure 36 is the print roll motor 26 and gear train 27 arranged to drive the print roll in the same manner as previously described in international application PCT/AU98/00544.<br>
Turning now to figure 38 there is illustrated the schematic operation of the preferred embodiment of the invention. Preferably, the computer system sends print data to the print controller chip 28 which can be a modified form of the ACP chip as discussed in the aforementioned PCT application. The ACP chip is responsible for operational control of the printhead and print roll to print out images on demand and to authenticate the print roll 29 which as discussed in the aforementioned application, can have an on board authentication system.<br>
In this manner a printer unit is provided, able to print images of photographic size (typically 6 inches by 4 inches) from a compact and simple to arrange printer unit adapted to be wholly contained within the disk drive bay of a PC.<br>
In both embodiments in accordance with the sixth inventive aspect, there is provided a mobile phone having an internal detachable printer which includes a separately detachable printhead and ink distribution unit assembly and further a preferably separately detachable paper or other print media supply. The mobile phone printer of at least the first preferred embodiment is of a standard size thereby conferring a high level of convenience during operation. The primary differences between the two embodiments relate to form of the print media and the location of the ink supply.<br>
Turning initially to figure 39, there is illustrated the first preferred embodiment printer phone 1 which looks like a conventional mobile phone including an earpiece 2, microphone 3, aerial 4, a series of push buttons 5 and a preferably colour LCD screen 6 for the display of information.<br>
In figure 40, the back portions of the first embodiment phone 1 is shown with the battery cover 8 removed so as to reveal a print media stock container 9 from which business card sized cards or sheets 10 are used on which to print images on by a printer unit 12. The print out onto the card can be processed signal information downloaded via the mobile phone 1 such as e-mail or other facilities.<br>
The mobile phone can optionally be equipped with a camera device 13 which can comprise, for example, a CMOS sensor designed to sense and store images on demand so that the mobile phone 1 can effectively act as a camera device for the printing out of images or their capture and forwarding across a mobile network.<br>
In figure 41, there is illustrated an exploded perspective view, partly in section,<br><br>
of the first mobile phone device 1 showing more detail of the printer assembly 12 including the printhead assembly 16 and feed means 17. The paper stock container 9 includes a series of cards 10 which are resiliently compressed by means of leaf springs 14. As shown in the other figures, the print media feed means 17 are provided in the form of pinch rollers 18 which are driven by motor 19 via gear train 20 and which is used to drive individual cards 10 to and past the printhead 16. The printhead may form part of an optionally replaceable printhead and ink distribution unit assembly 21 including an ink distribution unit 22 and can be substantially the same as that disclosed in Australian Provisional Patent No. PP6534 entitled "Micromechanical<br>
Device and Method-(IJ46A)" filed 16 October 1998 the contents of which are hereby incorporated by cross-reference.<br>
The ink distribution unit 22 of this first embodiment includes a series of ink supply reservoirs 23 to 26 which are provided for full colour printing. The reservoir 23 is substantially larger than the reservoirs 22 to 26 and can be utilized to store black ink. It is estimated that the ink supply will be sufficient for printing of approximately 2000 pages at 15 % coverage of black or 200 photos of 50 % coverage of CMYK. A more detailed view of the printer assembly 12 is illustrated in figure 42A with an expanded technical description being disclosed in the aforementioned provisional patent specification.<br>
The mobile phone system can be operated electronically under the control of a series of one or more application specific integrated circuits (ASICS) which incorporate the usual mobile phone capabilities in addition to camera and image processing capabilities. A sample block diagram indicating the electrical interconnections for this first embodiment is shown in figure 44. A suitable adaptation of the system as outlined in PCT Patent Application PCT/AU98/00544 filed by the present application can be utilized in the design of the ASIC. Other alternative system designs can be incorporated in accordance with the knowledge of those skilled in this particular field.<br>
Other features/components of the phone device, the function of which will be readily apparent, are identified in the accompanying illustrations by the following reference numerals.<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Turning next to figures 45 to 53, there is shown a second embodiment printer phone according to the invention. Wherever possible like reference numerals will be used to denote corresponding features.<br>
The major differences between the two embodiments are that instead of having a card dispenser and printhead with integral ink supply, this second embodiment utilises a replaceable combined paper and ink print roll cartridge. The cartridge can be substantially the same as that described in the applicant's earlier applications USSN 09/113,073 "Digital Camera System with Integral Print Roll"; USSN 09/113,053 "Print Media Roll and Ink Replaceable Cartridge"; USSN 09/112,744 "Anisotropic Rigidity to Reduce Curl in Rolled Media"; USSN 09/112,823 "Miniature Color Printer using Ink and Paper Cartridges"; and USSN 09/112,783 "Ink and Media Cartridge with Axial Ink Chambers" the contents all of which are incorporated herein by cross reference.<br>
Another difference resides in the optional inclusion of a scanning facility, which whilst described with reference to the second embodiment, could also be included in the first embodiment, although it is envisaged mat in practice this facility is better suited for use with print media in the form of a print roll. Further, the additional space required to accommodate the scanning facility is less of a problem with the second embodiment which by design cannot be as compact as the first embodiment. More details of these different features are described below.<br>
In the second embodiment, the phone casing 50 is configured to receive the paper and ink print roll cartridge 51 via a cartridge hatch 52 formed in the base of the phone. Also provided in the base of the phone are the usual DC in and USB connectors 53 and 54.<br><br>
In mis particular embodiment, the camera device 13 is located on the rear of the phone and is operable via a camera take button 56. The printer phone may also include a scanning head (not shown) in the form of a linear CMOS image sensor which is located within the right hand side of the casing adjacent an image scan path defined by a scanning image slot 57 having an entry 58 in the front of the phone and an exit 59 at the rear of the phone.<br>
As can be best seen in figure 52, the paper and ink print roll cartridge 51 is of similar shape to a conventional 35 mm camera film cartridge, having a paper exit 61<br>
which when installed aligns with a corresponding printer exit slot 62 formed in the front left hand side of the phone casing 50. However, the cartridge 51 is substantially longer, as it preferably contains sufficient print media and ink for 36 images, each 100mm x 150mm, the customary size of a photographic print. The printhead and ink distribution unit assembly 21 is located behind the portion of the base molding identified at 65.<br>
The second embodiment printer phone 1 can also be operated under the control of a series of one or more ASIC chips which incorporate the usual mobile phone capabilities in addition to camera and scanner image processing capabilities. Again, a suitable adaptation of the system as outlined in PCT Patent Application PCT/AU98/00544 filed by the present application can be utilised in the design of the ASIC chip.<br>
In use the operation of this second embodiment is very similar to mat of the first with the exception of the additional scanner facility. Replacement of the paper and ink supply is achieved by simply opening the cartridge hatch 52, removing the old cartridge and inserting a new one. The cartridge includes piercable ink outlets which engage nozzles on the ink distribution assembly connected with the printhead.<br>
In the preferred embodiment of the seventh inventive aspect illustrated, there has provided a mobile phone having an internal printer which includes a separately detachable printhead and ink supply module. The printer phone can be produced at or close to a standard size phone for any system including PHS, GSM and GPRS, thereby conferring a higher level of convenience during operation,<br>
Turning initially to figure 54, there is illustrated the preferred embodiment 1 in the form of a  PHS phone and which in many ways looks like and includes the features<br>
of a conventional mobile phone of this type including an ear piece 2, microphone 3, aerial 4, loud speaker 5, a series of push buttons 6 and a preferably colour LCD screen 7 for the display of information. Also included is a battery 8 as shown in figure 57. The phone 1 can optionally be equipped with a camera device 10 comprising lenses 11 and associated CCD chip or CMOS sensor 12. The CCD or CMOS sensor_ enables the device to store images on demand, so that the phone can effectively act as a camera device for the printing out of images, or for their capture and forwarding across a mobile phone network. The operation of the relevant part of the internal<br>
control electronics can be substantially as set out in the applicant's earlier PCT application WO 99/04551 entitled "A replenishable one time use camera system" the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. In other embodiments, the camera device may also be configured to enable video conferencing by facilitating simultaneous image processing during phone transmission. A camera function that is mounted for selective movable positioning on the phone device may be useful for this<br><br>
purpose. For example, it may be rotatable between a forward facing camera orientation and a rearward facing video conferencing orientation.<br>
The printer apparatus is shown generally at 15 and comprises a printhead and ink supply module 16 including a printhead 17, an ink supply/distribution unit 18 and a print media feed apparatus 20. The feed apparatus is of a conventional form including a motor 21 with associated gear train 22 which drive a series of feed rollers 23.<br>
The packaging of the printer apparatus 15 is best shown in figures 58,59 and 62. In mis regard the printer phone 1 is constructed around a rigid chassis molding 25. The chassis is adapted to slideably receive and retain the printhead and ink supply module 16 by means of retaining flanges 26 provided on the outer casing of the printhead module 16 which cooperate with under cut channels 27 provided on the chassis molding.<br>
The full operation of the printer apparatus 15 is best illustrated in figure 62. In use print media 30, preferably in the form of business card sized paper or card sheets, is fed in through an entry slot 31 provided in the external phone casing 32. This can be done manually or via a dispenser as described hereafter. The card 30 is then picked up by the powered entry feed rollers 23 and delivered to the printhead module 16. The printhead and ink supply module can be substantially the same as that disclosed in Australian Provisional Patent No. PP6534 entitled "Micromechanical Device and Method (IJ46A)" filed 16 October, 1998, the contents of which are also hereby incorporated by cross-reference. In such a device, the printhead is in the form of an elongate printhead chip that extends the full length of the print media pathway, so as to print the full width of the print media in a single pass without the need for any printhead traversing mechanisms;<br>
In this particular preferred embodiment, the printhead and ink module is formed as a sealed unit which is replaced in its totality after a predetermined amount of usage. The detailed structure of the ink supply and printhead module is shown more clearly in figure 61. The ink supply/distribution unit 18 is of a molded multi-part structure including a cover 35, a macro channel molding 36 defining four separate ink supply chambers 37-40 having therein optional flow control baffles 41. Connected with converging outlets of the macro channel molding 36 is a micro-molding 42 which defines similarly converging ink flow nozzles 43 that accurately direct the ink to minute ink supply inlets on the rear of the printhead 17. Optionally, an ink filter 44 is provided between the two moldings. A capping device 47 is also provided as part of the module for sealing and protecting the nozzle outlets when the printer head is not in use. It is estimated that the ink supply will on average be sufficient for printing approximately 1000 pages at 15% coverage of black-or 100 photos of 50% coverage of CMYK. An expanded technical description of the printhead and ink supply module can be found in the aforementioned provisional patent specification PP6534 and associated applications.<br>
The mobile phone system can be operated under the control of a series of one or more application specific integrated circuits (ASICS) which incorporate the usual mobile phone capabilities in addition to camera and image processing capabilities. An adaptation of the system outlined in PCT Patent Application PCT/AU98/00544 filed by the present applicant (also incorporated herein by reference) can be utilised in the design of the ASIC. The electrical interconnections for the preferred embodiment is shown schematically as a block-diagram in figure 16. Other, system designs well known to those skilled hi this field may also be used.<br>
Referring next to figures 64 to 68 there is illustrated a print media dispenser 50 configured for use with the PHS phone of the previous embodiments. The dispenser comprises a lower molding 51 that defines a media storage and dispensing region 52 and a cradle 53 which supports the printer phone 1 and aligns it with the outlet of the dispenser.<br>
The interactive operation of the print media dispenser with the phone 1 is best illustrated in figure 67. As can be seen, the dispenser 50 has a storage area 52 in<br>
which is disposed a quantity of print media in the form of business card sized paper or card sheets 54. These cards are supported on a metal base plate 55 which is sprung by means of opposed spring fingers 56 as shown in figure 68. In this manner, the card supply is constantly biased upwardly toward a media ejector mechanism 58. The ejector mechanism includes an ejector slider 59 which is operable upon manual sliding againsta return spring 60 to pick up the top card and feed this out of the dispenser outlet 61 and into the media entry slot 31 on the phone 1. On release, the slider automatically returns to the home position to engage the next card ready for further loading.<br>
Desirably, the printer phone 1 and/or printhead and ink supply module 16 includes an authentication mechanism such as mat outlined in the applicant's earlier PCT application no. PCT/AU98/00544 entitled "A camera with an internal printing system". This can be used to ensure not only that an authenticated approved consumable (such as the printhead and ink supply module) is used with the printer phone, but can also be used to store data on the relative usages of the consumable components such as the ink or the printhead itself and can optionally be used to set a predetermined usage for these items.<br>
As noted above, the phone device of the invention may be any kind of mobile phone mat sends and receives signals in a manner which can be processed into a printable form. Further, while the preferred form described has a printhead and ink ' distribution unit which has an integrally formed and attached ink supply, the ink supply could be separate and optionally also separately replenishable.<br>
In the illustrated preferred embodiment according to the eighth inventive aspect, mere is provided a video game player which includes an integral printer which is able to print out, preferably on business card sized cards, information which enhances the interactivity of the video game.<br>
Turning to the figures, there is shown a video game console 1 comprising a .printer module 2 and Digital Video Disk (DVD) player module 3. Connected to the console is an optional detachable controller module 4 as shown in figure 70. The detachable controller module can communicate with the console by any suitable means including wireless systems .such as "Bluetooth" or cable etc. and can be<br>
releasably secured to the console by any suitable means including magnetic coupling 5 or mechanical interlocking.<br>
"The printer module 2 and DVD player module 3 are interconnected by means of connecting housing extensions 6 and 7 which hinge about pivots 8 as shown in figure 3. The lower connecting extension 7 preferably includes various input/output connectors and ports 9 for optionally connecting joy sticks and other interactive devices. A video outlet port is also provided for connection with standard video type devices as is common in the art Further ports can also be provided for an external power source or other devices such as sound systems to be interconnected to the console.<br>
The DVD player module 3 is able to take standard DVD games disks 10 as is becoming popular in the industry. The DVD player is interconnected to a high end processor (not shown) which can be constructed along similar lines to standard high end video game processors or along the lines of that discussed in PCT Patent Application No. PCT/AU98/00544, the contents of which are specifically incorporated herein by cross reference. The processor in turn utilizes memory for standard video game functions and interacts with me print controller chip which is also preferably housed with the high end processor on PCB 11 within the printer module 2. The controller chip (also not shown) can be structured along the lines set out in Australian provisional patent specification entitled Image creation method and apparatus (ART 77)' filed 9 November, 1998, the contents of which are again incorporated by cross reference. Batteries for driving the console are preferably located in the base of the DVD player module as shown by arrow 12.<br>
The printer module 2 is preferably constructed so as to simultaneously provide a closure for the DVD player module 3. This is achieved by hinging the printer unit to the DVD module as shown. The printer module 2 comprises a base molding 14 that is configured to fully enclose a DVD disk receiving compartment 15 formed in the upper surface of the DVD player module 3. The base molding 14 is further configured to define an integral chassis structure 16 adapted on its under side to receive and locate an ink and paper cartridge 18.<br>
The upper surface of the chassis structure 16 is configured to support a printhead<br>
and ink distribution assembly 19, print media feed mechanism 20, and ink connecting hoses 21, the latter linking ink outlet nozzles 22 on the chassis with ink inlet nozzles 23 provided on the printhead and ink distribution assembly 19. The printer and DVD control PCB 10 is also supported on the chassis 16 and has flexible connections 26 extending therefrom to interconnect the DVD and printer control buttons 27 and 28 provided on a top cover molding 29.<br>
Details of the printhead, ink distribution assembly and print media feed means are best illustrated in figure 77. The printhead, which is preferably in the form of a pagewidth inkjet printhead chip, is packaged with an ink distribution unit and printhead cover into a printhead module 30. This module 30 is supported on a printhead chassis molding 32, and further includes a printhead capping mechanism 33, paired drive rollers 34 and 35, stepper motor 36 and an associated gear box 37 that engages the drive rollers 34 and 35.<br>
The preferred ink and paper cartridge is preferably in accordance with that described in the applicant's copending simultaneously filed application entitled "Ink and print media cartridge with integral pickup roller", the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. In the alternate embodiment illustrated in the accompanying drawings the ink and paper cartridge comprises a casing 40 defining an upper print media storage region 41 adapted to hold a stack of paper cards or sheets 42. A card dispensing outlet is shown at 43. The lower portion of the casing defines an ink supply region 45 which is separated internally into four sections each of which connect with piercable ink supply outlets 46. On installation, these outlets 46 are pierced by formations in the underside of the base molding so mat ink flows from the cartridge to the outlet nozzles on the chassis 16, via connecting hoses 21, to the printhead and ink distribution assembly 19.<br>
In yet another embodiment, the printer unit and print media container can be snap fitted into the console and can be constructed in accordance with the principles as outlined in Australian provisional patent entitled Image creation method and apparatus (ART 79)' also filed by the present applicant, the contents of which are also hereby incorporated by cross reference.<br>
In use, the console is connected to a video device and a DVD 48 is inserted into<br>
the DVD player module 3. Appropriate controllers are then selected. These may be the detachable controller module 1 as shown in figure 70, or alternatively other external interactive controllers. The printer can then be operated during execution of the program in the DVD either manually or automatically as discussed in more .detail below.<br>
It will be evident to those skilled in the art that the preferred embodiment provides for a video games system enabling print on demand cards. These cards can be utilized for a number of purposes. Firstly, the video game can, at certain predetermined levels, print out a series of "brag cards'. These can provide a.high resolution picture which can only be achieved at a certain point in the game. The brag cards can be personalised with the game players name, score, chosen character, accumulated wealth or objects, etc. The cards could also include a photographic likeness where the video game arrangement includes an optional image sensor (not shown). With such an option, the brag cards could also be personalised with a photographic likeness mapping on to 3D characters etc.<br>
The DVD player can be adapted to play standard DVD movies in addition to being configured to read CD-ROMs so as to provide information from encyclopaedias, maps etc provided by other CD-ROMs or DVD disks. In this manner, images from DVD movies and information from such CD-ROM or DVD repositories can be printed out. It should be noted that while the preferred form uses a DVD player or drive, the interactive programs may be stored on CD-ROM or on semiconductor memory cartridges, the latter being popularly used with pocket sized prior art video game devices.<br>
Additionally, although the preferred embodiment described is designed for optional use with non portable external display and control devices, the game storage medium, controls, game processor, screen, audio and printer may all be housed in the same housing, and this may be pocket sized if required.<br>
Where educational software is provided, the printer can be utilized to print out standard award certificates or diplomas upon reaching various levels. Such a system provides for an ideal incentive for children utilizing the system to become further involved in educational software running on the system. The utilization of the printer<br>
also allows parents to monitor children in the utilization of the device through, for example, the demanding of certain information or diploma certificates being printed out at various steps before the device is able to be utilized as a game playing machine. The arrangement can be synergistic between the game playing and educational-software, where the educational software prints out a code or clue for utilization by the user in playing the games. Of course, many other interactive uses can be provided.<br>
.Referring to the drawings, there is shown a cartridge 1 in accordance with the ninth inventive aspect for a printing device including a casing shown generally at 2. In the illustrated preferred form, the casing is divided into two main portions comprising, a print media supply portion 3 for housing sheets of paper and the like, and a second storage portion 4 for housing an ink supply. This cartridge is designed for use with digital printing devices, and is particularly suitable for drop-on-demand inkjet printing devices.<br>
The casing 2 also defines a print media exit opening 5 that connects with the print media storage portion 3 and a print media transport mechanism shown generally at 7. This transport mechanism is disposed within the print media housing portion 3 adjacent the print media exit 5, such that upon operation it picks up and drives the print media 8 out through the print media exit opening.<br>
Turning first to consider the elements of the print media storage portion of the cartridge, it can be seen to comprise a media top molding 10 which mates with a corresponding bottom molding 11. In this manner the moldings combine to define a generally rectangular print media storage region 12 in which is housed print media in the form of a stack of paper sheets or cards.<br>
The top and bottom moldings 10 and 11 are both configured at a front end to define, in combination, the print media exit opening 5. In use, the stack of cards 8 are disposed within the storage region 12. These are biased downwardly toward engagement with an upper surface 14 of the bottom molding 11 by means of thin metal springs 15-which bear against an inner lower surface 16 of the top molding 10.<br>
The print media transport mechanism of the preferred form illustrated is in the form of a geared pick up roller assembly 18. This assembly includes a drive shaft 19,<br>
pick up rollers 20 that are rigidly secured to the drive shaft, and an extemal drive gear<br>
21.<br>
The transport assembly 18 is captively retained within the casing portion formed by the top and bottom print media moldings, the drive shaft 19 being rotably supported by means of arcuate ribs 22 formed in a channel 23 located beneath the exit opening 5. The top molding fully encloses the portion of the drive shaft holding the pick up rollers 20, but leaves the external drive gear 21 exposed as shown. In an alternate form, the drive gear may be accessed via an opening in the casing for engagement with a corresponding powered roller on the printer device. A plastic or metal foil 25 is also provided adjacent the exit opening 5. This foil is sized to extend downwardly across the exit such that once the transport mechanism is operated, only a single sheet of paper or card is driven through the exit at any one time.<br>
The ink storage portion 4 is similarly defined by two separate moldings forming part of the cartridge casing. The primary molding is the ink storage base molding 26 which is configured to define a plurality of distinct ink chambers 27. Ultimately, the chambers are sealed by direct or indirect connection of mis base molding 26 to a cover molding, which in mis preferred form is provided by an underside 28 of the print media storage bottom molding 11.<br>
In the preferred form shown, the connection of the two moldings is indirect, as mere is provided an intermediate thin walled deformable film 30 which is preferably initially contoured to nest within the ink chambers 27 defined b the base molding 26. During assembly, the base molding 26 is sealingly connected with a flange 31 provided around the periphery of the thin walled deformable film 30 which in  turn is sealingly connected with the underside 28 of the print media storage bottom molding 11.<br>
As can be seen from the drawings, the ink chambers base molding 27 preferably extends beyond the peripheral edge of the print media storage region above, so as to define an ink supply connection manifold region 32. The upper portion of the manifold 32 is formed as an extension 33 of the print media storage bottom molding 11 and includes thereon a plurality of ink connection nozzles 34 which are closed by means of piercable ink seals 35. In use the ink is stored above the deformable film<br>
and is thereby in fluid communication with the ink connection nozzles 34. In order to facilitate collapsing of the deformable film 30 as the ink is withdrawn, air vents 37 are provided in the ink storage base molding 26, preferably at the end remote from the ink nozzles. The various components of the cartridge casing can be assembled by any suitable means including use of adhesives, ultrasonic welding or mechanical fasteners or the like.<br>
A preferred application of the cartridge of the invention as hereinbefore described is for use in a video games console having an integral printer of the kind described in Australian provisional patent application PP7020 and corresponding US application entitled "A video game console with integral printer device" filed concurrently herewith, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
In use, the cartridge of the invention is inserted into an appropriately configured printer device whereby the drive gear 21 aligns with and engages a corresponding driven gear provided on the printer mechanism. The advantages of this configuration are numerous. Most importantly, the provision of the transportation means within the cartridge, ensures that the paper or other print media is fed out of the cartridge accurately and with minimum initial contamination, as the mechanism and print media are housed within an enclosed unit In cartridges of the prior art, the cartridge is pressed onto a pick up roller mounted in the printer device, which exposes the paper on the underside. By contrast, the present design allows for greater structural integrity as there is no need to provide an opening that exposes the print media to that same extent. Further, the design provides for a tamper proof unit<br>
Additional advantages relating to the preferred forms include the provision of<br>
seals over the ink outlet nozzles that are piercable automatically by the printer mechanism upon loading. In this regard, the cartridge is intended only as a single use product Additionally, the structure of the ink chamber molding whereby the deformable film and base can be molded or joined in a simultaneous operation to form a completely sealed ink chamber, clearly offers manufacturing cost and efficiency advantages.<br>
The print media transport mechanism need not be limited to a pick up roller mechanism, but could include any other suitable mechanisms which can be externally<br>
driven from outside the cartridge casing. Similarly, the means of storage of the ink is not limited to the form described and could include the use of other dcformable or non-deformable storage means.<br>
Although the inventions have been described with reference to specific examples, it will be appreciated that they can each be embodied in many other forms.<br><br>
