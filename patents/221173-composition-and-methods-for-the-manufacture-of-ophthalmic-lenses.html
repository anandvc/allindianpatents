				<td>Drilling Tool<br>
Description<br>
The invention relates to a drilling tool comprising<br>
a base body which can be rotated about a drilling axis,<br>
comprising at least two plate seats arranged on the front<br>
face in the base body, and comprising cutting plates<br>
which can be interchangeably inserted into the plate<br>
seats, and are preferably identical, and which cutting<br>
plates each have a machining face and clearance face<br>
adjoining a principal cutting edge, a seat face facing<br>
away from the clearance face, and a guiding land<br>
adjoining radially on the outside through each edge<br>
thereof the machining face, the clearance face and<br>
optionally the seat face, and a hole which extends<br>
through the clearance face anc the seat face for a<br>
retaining screw which can be screwed into a threaded bore<br>
which is open to the front face of the base body in the<br>
area of the plate seats.<br>
Drilling tools of this type are mostly used as<br>
double or multiple-edged solid drills, which are<br>
constructed similar to a twist drill, however, with<br>
interchangeable cutting plates. The cutting plates,<br>
which are screwed on the front face into the drill bit,<br>
have in the area of their cutting edges a set angle which<br>
assures that the drill is centered in the bore. The<br>
cutting plates have in the conventional drilling tools of<br>
this type (DE-A-3611999, US-4961672) a complicated plate<br>
form which can only be manufactured via hard-metal<br>
injection die-casting technology. Since the hard metal<br>
is brittle, the cutting plates consisting thereof may not<br>
be stressed with respect to bending. Such bending loads<br>
are supposed to be avoided with the complicated plate<br>
forms of the state of the art. Because of their<br>
complicated form, the cutting plates are expensive to<br>
manufacture and are therefore disproportionately<br>
expensive for mass usage. The fastening screws extend<br>
there throughout into threaded bores of the base body,<br>
which threaded bores are aligned axially parallel tc the<br>
drilling axis. The holes in the cutting plates are<br>
accordingly aligned inclined to the respective clearance<br>
face. Double or multiple cutting edges are designed with<br>
a high forward feed for high machining performances.<br>
Correspondingly high are the reaction forces to be<br>
transferred through the cutting plates into the base<br>
body. The plate seats of the known drills are designed<br>
with rather thin walls in the area of their seat edges,<br>
and therefore lead to problems during longer machining<br>
times because of the demanded machining performances.<br>
Based on this, the basic purpose of the invention is<br>
to provide a double or multiple-edged drilling tool of<br>
the above-disclosed type which enables the use of cutting<br>
plates having a simple plate form, yet permits even in<br>
the case of high machining performances an optimum<br>
coupling of the forces engaging the cutting plates during<br>
the machining operation into the base body.<br>
The basic thought of the invention is that the plate<br>
form can be simplified during an optimum force<br>
introduction by the holes being aligned with their axes<br>
perpendicularly to the clearance face of the associated<br>
cutting plates, and by the axes of the threaded bores<br>
being aligned inclined with respect to the drilling axis<br>
and inclined to each other in the base body. Threaded<br>
bores are advantageously placed where there is sufficient<br>
material in the base body. Consideration must thereby be<br>
given that the base body has through the existing flutes<br>
on the one hand and through coolant bores on the other<br>
hand still further structural constructions, which leaves<br>
only a limited possibility to orient the threaded bores.<br>
A further thought is that the plate seats are placed into<br>
the base body in such a manner that the principal cutting<br>
forces accumulating due to the machining are introduced<br>
through the cutting plates distortion-free onto the plate<br>
seats or into the base body. The clearance faces and the<br>
seat face of the individual cutting plates are according<br>
to a preferred embodiment of the invention aligned in<br>
parallel planes so that the hole with its axis is also<br>
aligned perpendicularly to the seat face. From, this<br>
follows that the axes of the threaded bores are aligned<br>
inclined to the. drilling axis and to each other. The<br>
threaded bores in the base body are preferably directed<br>
from their front-face opening inclined in direction of an<br>
axially parallel plane extending through the principal<br>
cutting edge of the associated cutting plate, and<br>
inclined in direction of an axially parallel plane<br>
perpendicular to and extending through the axis of the<br>
base body. By inclining the threaded bores in the base<br>
body, the point angle of the drill and of the clearance-<br>
face angle is with plane-parallel cutting plates<br>
pregiven. Due to the plane-parallel cutting plates, all<br>
parameters important for the cutting operation are<br>
defined by the plate seat, whereas the bore diameter is<br>
defined by the radial position of the guiding land on the<br>
cutting plate.<br>
The principal cutting edges of the cutting plates<br>
lead in cutting direction of the drill a center plane,<br>
which is parallel to these and to the drilling axis,<br>
whereby the cutting plates are arranged mirror-<br>
symmetrically with respect to the drilling axis on the<br>
drill body.<br>
The adjacent cutting plates have in the area of the<br>
drilling axis a distance of less than 0.2 mm, preferably<br>
0.05 to 0.15 mm from each other. The radially inner part<br>
of the cutting edge is chamfered in such a manner that a<br>
type of an auxiliary cutting edge results in the central<br>
region, which cuts around the center. Thus a minimum<br>
slug or peg remains standing during the drilling<br>
operation, the diameter of which slug or peg is less than<br>
0.1 mm. This peg is not machined but in the case of most<br>
materials it is crumbled. Mainly in the case of<br>
workpieces made out of a tough material, like special<br>
steel/ the crumbling occurs only when the distance<br>
between the plates is correspondingly small. It has been<br>
proven that at a plate spacing of 0.1 mm even in the case<br>
of blind-hole bores no peg remains in the center. Rather<br>
the peg is completely crumbled so that no finish<br>
machining is needed. A further improvement in this<br>
respect is achieved when a deflecting incline which,<br>
starting out from the cutting plates, ends in one of the<br>
chip-conveying grooves and is arranged asymmetrically<br>
with respect to the drilling axis, is formed into the<br>
base body in the space between the two cutting plates.<br>
In order to guarantee a constant force coupling of<br>
the cutting plates into the base body without load peaks,<br>
it is suggested according to the invention that the<br>
cutting plates are form-lockingly fitted with at least<br>
two edge faces defining an angle with each other into the<br>
associated plate seat. The retaining screws have thereby<br>
advantageously a flat head fitted into a conical recess<br>
in the area of the hole, whereby the flat-head fit and<br>
the seat fit are reciprocally offset in order to produce<br>
a press fit. The two edge faces form-lockingly fitted<br>
into the plate seat define advantageously an angle of 80°<br>
to 100°, preferably of 90° with each other, and are<br>
advantageously connected to each other through a rounded<br>
corner. The rounded contour of the seat edges in the<br>
transition area assures a form-locking enclosing of the<br>
cutting plate in this area. This results on the one hand<br>
in a high interchangeable exactness and on the other hand<br>
in a stabilization of the base body and a constant force<br>
coupling of the cutting plate into the base body, without<br>
load peaks, as they occur, for example, in the case of<br>
edged plate seats.<br>
It has furthermore been proven to be advantageous<br>
that the principal cutting edge of the cutting plate and<br>
the boundary edge of the seat edge adjacent to the<br>
machining face, which boundary edge is on the side of the<br>
clearance face, define an angle of 60° to 80° with each<br>
other, whereby the principal cutting edge and the<br>
respective boundary edge can be connected to each other<br>
through a rounded or faceted cutting-edge or edge<br>
portion. The principal cutting edge and the boundary<br>
edge of the seat edge facing away from the machining<br>
face, which boundary edge is on the side of the clearance<br>
face, advantageously define on the other hand a radially<br>
outwardly converging acute angle of 10° to 30° with each<br>
other, whereas the guiding land and the seat edge facing<br>
away from the principal cutting edge can be connected to<br>
each other through an edge face which is inclined<br>
radially inwardly directed with respect to the guiding<br>
land. With this plate form it is assured that sufficient<br>
material exists outside of the plate seat in the base<br>
body, which assures a stable support of the cutting plate<br>
on the base body.<br>
The guiding land of the cutting plate is according<br>
to a further preferred embodiment of the invention<br>
aligned parallel to the drilling axis throughout the<br>
plate thickness in the built-in state. The clearance<br>
face and the guiding land define thereby advantageously<br>
an angle larger than 90" with each other, whereas the<br>
angle between the principal cutting edge and the boundary<br>
edge of the guiding land, which boundary edge is on the<br>
side of the clearance face, is approximately 90°. The<br>
guiding land extends thus over the entire plate<br>
thickness. In order to obtain a sufficient guiding in<br>
the area of the guiding land, the plate thickness should<br>
be chosen to be at least 0.2 times the bore radius. The<br>
plate thickness corresponds advantageously to 0.2 to 0.5<br>
times the bore radius.<br>
The inventive measures guarantee that the center<br>
position of the cutting plates are determined by the<br>
plate seat. The hole is thereby oriented within the<br>
cutting plate in direction of the drill center, whereby<br>
the optimum position of the hole is in the area of the<br>
center of gravity of the cutting plate.<br>
An important advantage of the invention is that with<br>
one single plate blank it is possible to realize through<br>
a simple grinding in the area of the guiding land<br>
steplessly varying bore diameters. Thu9 it is also<br>
possible to cover with one and the same base body a<br>
larger diameter range than has been possible thus far.<br>
Also the diameter graduations in the base body can be<br>
chosen larger than the up to now common millimeter<br>
spacing.<br>
The invention will be discussed in greater detail<br>
hereinafter in connection with one exemplary embodiment<br>
schematically illustrated in the accompanying drawings, in which:<br>

drilling tool;<br>

drilling tool in a position rotated relative to Figure<br>

tool;<br>

the drilling tool;<br>
Figures 5a and 5b illustrate enlarged fragments of<br>
Figures 3a and 3b;<br>
Figure 6 illustrates an enlarged fragment of Figure<br>
4b.<br>
The drilling tool illustrated in the drawings is<br>
constructed as a double-edged solid drill. The drilling<br>
tool is designated for insertion into machine tools, and<br>
has for this purpose a coupling shaft 12 bordered by a<br>
coupling flange 10 providing a plane-surface bearing for<br>
connection to-a machine spindle (not illustrated). An<br>
elongated base body 14 is also connected to the coupling<br>
flange 10, which base body has two plate seats 16 on the<br>
front face, from which plate seats extend chip-conveying<br>
grooves 18 over the length of the base body 14. Two<br>
cutting plates 20 having the same construction are<br>
exchangeably arranged in the plate seat 16 and are<br>
fastened to the base body 14 via retaining screws 22.<br>
The cutting plates 20 have a clearance face 24 and a<br>
seat face 26 facing away from this clearance face, which<br>
faces are arranged in parallel planes. The clearance<br>
face 24 is on the side of the chip-conveying groove<br>
defined by the principal cutting edge 28 and the<br>
following machining face ending in the chip-conveying<br>
groove 18. The principal cutting edge 28 and the<br>
machining face 30 are followed radially outwardly by an<br>
auxiliary cutting edge 32 also designed as a guiding edge<br>
and a guiding land 34. The auxiliary cutting edge 32 is<br>
formed at an angle of 90° relative to the principal<br>
cutting edge, whereas the land 34 is oriented outwardly<br>
therefrom over the plate thickness parallel to the<br>
drilling axis 36. The lands 34 of the two cutting plates<br>
20 facilitate a guiding of the drilling tool in the drill<br>
hole, whereas the point angle of the principal cutting<br>
edges 28 of the two cutting plates 20, which can most of<br>
all be recognized in Figure 5b, guarantees a centering of<br>
the drill in the drill hole. The cutting plates 20 are<br>
furthermore defined by two seat edges 38, 40, which are<br>
essentially perpendicular to one another and of which<br>
the one (38) follows the principal cutting edge 28 under<br>
an angle of approximately 60° to 80° in the vicinity of<br>
the drilling axis, and the other one (40) lies opposite<br>
the principal cutting edge 28, and defines with same an<br>
outwardly converging angle of 10° to 30°. The principal<br>
cutting edge 28 transfers thereby through a rounded or<br>
faceted cutting-edge and edge portion 42 over into the<br>
seat edge 38, whereas the seat edge 38 and the seat edge<br>
40 are connected to one another through a curved<br>
transition portion 44. The radially outer end of the<br>
seat edge 40 is followed by a boundary surface 4 6, which<br>
extends inclined radially outwardly with respect to the<br>
guiding land.<br>
The cutting plates are spaced in the mounted state<br>
in the area of their principal cutting edges 28 at a very<br>
small distance of 0.05 to 0.2 mm from one another. To<br>
fix and position the cutting plates 20 in the plate seats<br>
16, the retaining screws 22, which are designed as flat<br>
head screws, extend through holes 48 in the cutting<br>
plates 20 and are screwed into threaded bores 50 in the<br>
base body 14. The holes 48 are aligned with their axes<br>
perpendicularly with respect to the clearance face 24 and<br>
with respect to the seat face 26 of the cutting plates<br>
20. The threaded bores 50 are accordingly, in order to<br>
adjust a defined point angle between the principal<br>
cutting edges 28 and a pregiven clearance angle in the<br>
area of the clearance face 24, aligned with their axis<br>
inclined with respect to the drilling axis 36. As can be<br>
seen in Figures 5a and 5b, the axes of the threaded bores<br>
are aligned inclined with respect to the drilling axis 36<br>
and with respect to one another. They are directed in<br>
the base body starting from their front-face opening 52<br>
inclined in direction of an axially parallel plane<br>
extending through the principal cutting edge 28 of the<br>
associated cutting plate 20, and at the same time<br>
inclined in direction of an axially parallel plane which<br>
is perpendicular to and extends through the drilling axis<br>
36. The hole 48' for the screws is positioned relatively<br>
far from the drilling axis 36, and is oriented in a<br>
spaced relation from the principal cutting edge 28 and<br>
into the corner area between the seat edges 38, 40. It<br>
is achieved with these measures that the threaded bores<br>
50 meet in the area of the base body 14 with sufficient<br>
surrounding material, whereby it is assured that neither<br>
the chip-conveying grooves 19 nor the coolant channels 54<br>
are cut into. The retaining screws 22 have a flat head<br>
58, which is fitted into a conical recess 56 in the<br>
cutting plate 20, and wherein the recess 56 is positioned<br>
in relationship to the seat edges 38, 40 in such a manner<br>
that the flat-head fit and the seat fit are reciprocally<br>
offset in order to create a press fit. Thus it is<br>
possible to position the cutting plates 20 with respect<br>
to the drilling axis 36 exactly into the plate seat 16.<br>
The desired bore diameter is adjusted by grinding<br>
material from the cutting plates 20 in the area of the<br>
lands 34, Thus it is possible to steplessly adjust with<br>
one single plate blank varying bore diameters.<br>
In order to guarantee at high drilling performances<br>
a shatter-free drilling, a minimum plate thickness is<br>
needed in order to provide a sufficiently long guiding<br>
land, which minimum plate thickness corresponds<br>
preferably to 0.2 to 0.5 times the bore radius.<br>
Since the cutting plates do not cut adjacent the<br>
drilling axis but are spaced in this area at a distance<br>
of 
remains standing there, which is not machined. When this<br>
peg has a sufficiently small ciameter, it is crumbled<br>
during the drilling operation. The distance between the<br>
cutting plates is thereby to be adjusted in such a manner<br>
than no peg remains standing in the center so that no<br>
finish machining is needed even when creating blind-hole<br>
bores.<br>
In summary the following is to be stated: The<br>
invention relates to a double or multiple-edged drilling<br>
tool. The drilling tool has a base body 14 which can be<br>
rotated above a drilling axis 36, and in which are<br>
arranged on its front face at least two plate seats 16 to<br>
accommodate identical interchangeable cutting plates 20.<br>
The interchangeable cutting plates each have a machining<br>
face 30 and a clearance face 24 which adjoin a principal<br>
cutting edge 28 to form a cutting wedge, and a seat face<br>
26 which faces away from the clearance face. A land 34<br>
is also provided which adjoins radially on the outside<br>
through each edge thereof the machining face 30, the<br>
clearance face 24 and optionally the seat face 26, and<br>
with which land the guiding of the drilling tool in the<br>
drill hole is supported. The cutting plates 20 are<br>
pierced by a hole 48 for a retaining screw 22 in the area<br>
of the clearance face 24 and of the seat face 26. The<br>
retaining screw is screwed into a threaded bore 50 which<br>
opens into the front face of the base body 14 in the area<br>
of the plate seat. The axes of the holes 48 are<br>
according to the invention aligned perpendicularly to the<br>
clearance face 24 and preferably to the seat face 26 of<br>
the associated cutting plates 20, whereas the axes of the<br>
threaded bores 50 are aligned inclined with respect to<br>
the drilling axis 36 and inclined to each other.<br>
