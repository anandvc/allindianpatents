The term "pharmaceutically usable salts" embraces salts with inorganic or organic acid such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, nitric acid, sulphuric acid, phosphoric acid, citric acid, formic acid, maleic acid, acetic acid, succinic acid, tartaric acid, methanesulphonic acid, p-toluenesulphonic acid and the like.<br><br>
The compounds of formula I can be manufactured in accordance with the invention by cleaving off the protecting group(s) from a compound of formula II<br>
•■ ••111<br>
in which P1 represents a protecting group and the remaining symbols have the significance given in claim 1 and hydroxy groups which may be contained in R1, R2 and R4 are present in protected form, if desired, functionally modifying reactive groups in the thus-obtained compound of formula I and/or converting the compound of formula I into a pharmaceutically usable salt, with the manufacture  of 4-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-(3,4-methylenedioxy-benzyloxy)piperidine and its hydrochloride being excluded.<br>
The cleavage of a protecting group P1 and hydroxy protecting groups which may be present can be carried out in a manner known per se.   Examples of protecting groups P1 are usual amino protecting groups such as tert-butoxycarbonyl, benzyloxy-carbonyl, vinyloxycarbonyl, alkylsilylalkyloxycarbonyl such as 2-(trimethylsilyl)ethoxycarbonyl,  and trichloroethoxycarbonyl. Examples of hydroxy protecting groups are ether protecting groups such as tetrahydropyranyl, allyl, 2-(trimethylsilyl)ethoxy-methyl, trityl, tert-butyldimethylsilyl or ester protecting groups such as acetyl.<br>
The cleavage of these protecting groups is effected by acidic or basic hydrolysis, by hydrogenolysis, by reductive methods or by means of Lewis acids.   A solution of a mineral acid such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulphuric acid, phosphoric acid and the like in an inert solvent or solvent mixture is advantageously used for the acidic hydrolysis.   Suitable solvents are alcohols such as methanol or ethanol, ethers such as tetrahydrofuran or dioxan, chlorinated hydrocarbons such as<br><br>
methylene chloride, and the like.   Alkali metal hydroxides and alkali metal carbonates such as potassium hydroxide or sodium hydroxide or potassium carbonate or sodium carbonate, organic amines such as piperidine, and the like can be used for the basic hydrolysis.   Inert organic solvents as referred to above for the acidic hydrolysis can be used as solubilizers.   The reaction temperature for the acidic and basic hydrolysis can be varied in a range from 0 °C to the reflux temperature, with the reaction preferably being carried out at between about 0°C and room temperature.   The tert-butoxycarbonyl group is conveniently cleaved off with hydrochloric acid, hydrogen chloride, trifluoro-acetic acid or formic acid in the presence or absence of an inert solvent.   Furthermore, the tert-butoxycarbonyl group can be cleaved off by means of anhydrous zinc bromide in the presence of an inert solvent, preferably methylene chloride.   The cleavage of the trichloroethoxycarbonyl group can be advantageously effected reductively with zinc in glacial acetic acid.   The reaction temperature can lie in a range of 0°C  to 40°C , with the reaction preferably being carried out at room temperature.   The cleavage of the 2-(trimethylsilyl)ethoxycarbonyl group can be effected by means of fluoride ions in the presence of an inert solvent such as acetonitrile, dimethyl sulphoxide, dimethylformamide or tetrahydrofuran, preferably by means of tetrabutylammonium fluoride in tetrahydrofuran, at temperatures from about 0°C  to about room temperature.<br>
The compounds of formula II are novel and are also an object of the invention.   Their preparation is described in more detail hereinafter in Schemes 1-15 and in the Examples.<br><br><br>
In accordance with Scheme 1 compounds of general formula 3. can be obtained by reacting compounds of general formula 1 in a manner known per se with metal-organic derivatives, preferably lithium or magnesium derivatives, prepared from compounds of general formula 2. <br><br>
wherein Ra represents hydrogen or a substituent which is inert under the reaction conditions or in which reactive groups are present in protected form.   Preferably, compounds 2. in which Ra represents halogen, lower-alkoxy or benzyloxy are used and these substituents are utilized for the synthesis of another desired substituent at an appropriate later stage of the reaction sequence.<br>
The reaction with such a metal-organic compound 2. is effected according to methods known per se, for example in a solvent which is inert under the reaction conditions, such as an ether, at a temperature between about -78°C and 75°C . The compounds of general formula 6 can be obtained therefrom in the presence of an acid or another water-cleaving reagent, optionally in the presence of a base, in an organic solvent.   As acids there come into consideration e.g. hydrochloric acid, trifluoroacetic acid or p-toluenesulphonic acid, and as the water-cleaving reagent there can be used e.g. phosphorus oxytrichloride in pyridine.   The reaction temperature lies between 0-120°C ; as solvents there can be used e.g. toluene, dimethylformamide or alcohols.<br>
Compounds of general formula 6 can also be obtained directly starting from a compound of general formula 4 in which Tf is an activating group such as trifluoromethylsulphonyl (triflate) by reaction with a metal-organic compound, especially a tin derivative of general formula 5 in which R is lower-alkyl, e.g. butyl, or a corresponding arylboric acid derivative using a suitable catalyst such as e.g. tetrakis-triphenylphosphine-palladium in an inert solvent such as dioxan, dimethoxyethane or dimethylformamide at temperatures between room temperature and 1 50°C <br>
Compounds of general formula Z can be obtained from compounds of general formula 6 by hydroboration and subsequent basic oxidative working-up.   The hydroboration can be effected according to methods known per se, for example in a solvent which is inert under the reaction conditions, such as an ether, e.g.<br><br>
1,2-dimethoxyethane, at a temperature between about 0°C  and 70°C , and with a diborane-containing or diborane-liberating reagent such as e.g. borane in tetrahydrofuran or a mixture of sodium borohydride and boron trifluoride etherate.   The carbo-boranes which are formed as intermediates can be converted into the secondary alcohols of general formula 1_ by reaction with bases, e.g. potassium hydroxide, and an oxidizing agent, e.g. hydrogen peroxide, at a temperature between about room temperature and 120°C .<br>
Compounds of general formula 8. in which Ra is halogen, cyano,   trifluoromethyl,   lower-alkyl,   lower-alkoxy-lower-alkyl, lower-alkoxy or lower-alkylenedioxy can be obtained from 1_ by alkylation with a compound which yields the group R1.  The alkylation of the secondary alcohol is effected according to methods known per se, for example in a solvent which is inert under the reaction conditions, such as an ether, e.g. tetrahydro¬furan or 1,2-dimethoxyethane, or dimethylformamide, with the aid of an alcoholate-forming base, e.g. sodium hydride, at a temperature between about 0°C  and 40°C  and using a halide, preferably chloride or bromide, or a suiphonic acid ester, e.g. a mesylate or tosylate, as the compound which yields R1i. Compounds of formula Z in which Ra is lower-alkoxy can be converted into compounds of general formula 9£ by an alkyl-aryl ether cleavage.   The ether cleavage is effected according to methods known per se by, preferably starting from compounds in which Ra has the meaning methoxy, reacting the alkyl-aryl ether with mineral acids such as hydrobromic acid or hydroiodic acid or preferably with Lewis acids such as boron trichloride or boron tribromide in a solvent which is inert under the reaction conditions, such as e.g. a halogenated hydrocarbon, at a temperature between about -10°C and room temperature.<br>
Compounds of general formula 9 can be used as starting materials for the preparation of compounds of general formula 10 in which Rb is a group -Tl-L1-T2-L3-TS-L4-T4-U, T"!  is oxygen, (m), (o) or (p) and the remaining symbols L2,3,4,  T2.3,4 and U can have the meanings referred to earlier.   The linkage of the group<br><br>
-L2-T2-L3-T3-L4-T4-U can be effected selectively by reaction with a derivative of the group to be introduced which carries a suitable leaving group, although the desired group can also be built up stepwise.   The selective linkage with the phenolic alcohol is effected according to alkylation or acylation methods which are known per se in the presence of a base such as potassium carbonate.   Chlorides, bromides, iodides, tosylates or mesylates come into consideration as alkylating agents.   The reaction is effected in a solvent which is inert under the reaction conditions, such as e.g. an ether such as tetrahydrofuran or an aromatic hydrocarbon such as e.g. toluene, pyridine, acetone or methyl ethyl ketone, at a temperature between about 0°C  and 100°C .   Suitable acylating agents are activated derivatives such as optionally activated esters, acid halides, acid anhydrides or mixed acid anhydrides.   The reaction is effected in a solvent which is inert under the reaction conditions, such as e.g. an ether such as tetrahydrofuran, an aromatic hydrocarbon such as e.g. toluene, a chlorinated hydrocarbon such as methylene chloride or chloroform, and the like at a temperature between about 0°C  and 50°C .<br>
Reactive groups such as keto or hydroxy groups contained in addition to the leaving group in the group to be introduced are preferably present in a form which is protected in a suitable manner, e.g. in the form of acetals, esters, carbamates, silyl derivatives and the like.   After cleavage of these protecting groups a stepwise synthesis of the group -T'-L2-T2-L3-T3-L4-T4-U can be continued.  The thus-obtained compounds containing a hydroxy group in the piperidine ring can be alkylated as described above for the conversion of Z into 8.<br><br><br><br>
Compounds of formulae 12-1 6 can be prepared in accordance with Scheme 2 starting from compounds of general formula 11 in which Rc is chlorine, bromine, iodine as well as hydroxy in the form of an activated derivative such as e.g. the triflate and R15 is hydrogen or a group which is inert under the reaction conditions by carrying out palladium-catalyzed couplings in a manner known per se with carbon monoxide, cyanides, amines or compounds of the general formulae<br>
H2C=CH-R19	or	HC=C-R19<br>
wherein R19 is -COOR16, -CN or -OR20.<br>
As palladium catalysts there can be used complexes, prepared in situ, of e.g. PdCl2(CH3CN)2 or Pd(0Ac)2 with 1,1'-bis(diphenyl-phosphino)ferrocene, 1,3-bis(diphenylphosphino)propane or tri(o-tolyl)phosphine.   The group -HC=CH-RT9 or -C=C-R19 in the thus-obtained compounds can be derivatized for a further stepwise synthesis of a substituent L1-T1-L2-T2-L3-T3-L4-T4-U.   A C=C<br>
triple bond can be converted into a double bond and the latter can be converted into a single bond.  A cyano group can be converted into an amide, an aldehyde, an acid, an ester or an amine. Compounds of formula 13. with R17,18 = benzyl can be debenzylated and the thus-formed sec. or prim, amino group can also be utilized for a further derivatization.   All of these transformations or derivatizations, which are presented in a non-limiting manner in Schemes 3-9, can be undertaken according to methods known per se.<br><br><br><br>

Compounds of general formulae 36-40 can be obtained in accordance with Scheme 6 from compounds of general formula 35., obtained by reaction of compounds of general formula 11 with vinyl ethers by means of palladium catalysis.<br>
The piperidones of general formula 41 can be used as starting materials for the synthesis of the piperidine derivatives I analogously as described for the piperidone 1. They can be obtained analogously to the process of A.H. Beckett et al described in the Journal of Medicinal and Pharmaceutical Chemistry Vol 1(1), 37-58 (1959).   The piperidones of general formula 41 can be obtained by intramolecular ring-closure of a propionic acid derivative of general formula 42.,<br><br>
in which R4 is as defined earlier or represents a substituent, which is inert under the reaction conditions or wherein reactive groups are   present in an appropriately protected form. Preferably, R4 is choosen in a manner to make it possible to optionally construe another desired substituent at an appropriate later stage of the reaction sequence,   p1 has the meaning of methyl or benzyl. The ring closure is carried out in the presence of a base such as e.g. sodium alcoholate, sodium hydride or sodium dispersion in xylene.   The subsequent decarbalkoxylation of a thus-obtained compound of general formula 43 or 44<br><br>
by means of hydrochloric acid leads to compounds of general formula 41.<br><br>
Derivatives of general formula 43. in which R4 signifies allyl or benzyl can also be prepared in a direct manner by C-alkyl-ation of the sodium salt of a compound of general formula 45.<br><br>
by means of allyldimethylanilinium bromide or benzyldimethyl-anilinium bromide analogously to the process described by A.H.Beckett et al. (see above).<br>
Derivatives of general formula 41 in which R4 signifies hydroxymethyl which is suitably protected at the hydroxy function can also be obtained from the compound of general formula 45. by reduction to the diol analogously to the process described by E.Jaeger und J.H.Biel in J.Org.Chem. 30(3), 740-744 (1965), introduction of a suitable protecting group for the primary alcohol, e.g. trityl, and oxidation of the secondary alcohol obtained.<br>
Furthermore, derivatives of general formula 46. can be prepared by hydroxymethylating compounds of general formula 6 analogously to the process of K. Willcocks et al. described in the Journal of Labelled Compounds and Radiopharmaceuticals Vol. XXXIII, No.8, 783-794 (1993).<br><br>
Compounds of general formula II in which R3 has the meaning hydrogen and W has the meaning oxygen or sulphur can be obtained starting from compounds of general formula 47<br><br><br>
by epoxidation.   Compounds of general formula 47 can be prepared according to the process described by M.Ferles and M.Jankovsky in Coll.Czechoslov.Chem.Commun. Vol, 35, 2802-2809 (1970).  The epoxides can then be opened by reaction with suitable thio-phenolates and phenolates as described by R. Paioni in German Offenlegungsschrift 2738477.   The further synthesis to compounds of formula II can be effected as described previously.<br>
Scheme 7<br><br>
In accordance with Scheme 7 compounds of general formula 51 can be obtained from compounds of general formula 46 by firstly reducing the double bond using complex hydrides such as lithium aluminium hydride as described by J.M. Lundbeck et al. in European Patent Application E.P. 0 374 674 or sodium dihydrido-bis-(2-methoxyethoxy)aluminate in a solvent which is inert under<br><br>
the reaction conditions, such as tetrahydrofuran, dioxan or toluene, at temperatures between room temperature and 11 0°C  or hydrogenating the double bond with hydrogen using a catalyst, with compounds of general formula 48. being obtained.   Compounds of general formula 48. can be converted into the corresponding aldehydes of general formula 49. by a usual oxidation process, e.g. using oxalyl chloride and dimethyl sulphoxide as described by A.J. Mancuso and D. Swern in Synthesis 1981, 165.<br>
The condensation of aldehydes of general formula 49. with Grignard or lithium compounds in a solvent which is inert under the reaction conditions, such as ether, tetrahydrofuran or dioxan, at temperatures between -80°C  and room temperature leads to compounds of general formula 5.0 which can be converted according to known processes into the corresponding ester or ether compounds of general formula 51.<br>
Scheme 8<br><br>
In accordance with Scheme 8 compounds of general formula ^ are obtained by brominating compounds of general formula 1 in<br><br>
a solvent which is inert under the reaction conditions, such as chloroform or methylene chloride, and using a buffer salt such as disodium hydrogen phosphate at temperatures between 0°C and 50°C  to firstly form compounds of general formula 52., reaction of which with an alkali metal salt of a thiol in a solvent such as acetone, acetonitrile or dimethylformamide at temperatures between room temperature and 100°C  gives compounds of general formula .53..   Condensation of these with Grignard or lithium compounds in inert solvents such as ether, tetrahydrofuran or dioxan at temperatures between -80°C  and room temperature then yields compounds of general formula 54.<br>
Scheme 9<br><br>
In accordance with Scheme 9 compounds of general formula 56 can be obtained by dihydroxylating compounds of general formula 6 to compounds of general formula 55.   Alkylation of these yields, according to previously described processes, compounds of general formula .56.   The dihydroxylation can be effected according to processes known per se, for example in a solvent which is inert under the reaction conditions, such as acetone or tert-butanol, at a temperature between 0°C  and 50°C, preferably at room temperature, with a hydroxylating reagent such as e.g. a mixture of osmium tetroxide and hydrogen peroxide.<br>
The compounds prepared in Schemes 2-9 can, moreover, be used as described above as starting materials for a further synthesis of a substituent<br>
-Ll -Tl -L2-T2-L3-T3-L4-T4-U<br><br>
optionally present in R2,<br>
Furthermore, compounds of general formula II in which an ethylene bridge Q is present can be prepared in accordance with the processes described in Schemes 1-9 as well as the processes described hereinbefore and in more detail in the Examples.<br><br>
The tropinones of general formula 57 usable as starting materials can be prepared, inter alia, according to the processes described by M.Lounasmaa and CJ.Johansson in Tetrahedron Letters, No.29, 2509 (1974) or O.Kovacs et al. in Helv.Chim.Acta Vol. XXXVII, 802 (1954).<br><br>
Derivatives of general formfula 57 can be obtained from the compound of general formula 58 according to the process described by O.Kovacs et al. in Helv.Chim.Acta Vol. XXXVII, 802 (1954) by reduction to the diol, introduction of a suitable protecting group for the primary alcohol, e.g. trityl, and oxidation of the secondary alcohol obtained. Herein, R4 is as defined earlier or is a substituent which is inert under the raction conditions or wherein any reactive groups are present in protected form and are preferably choosen in a manner to make the construction of another desired substituent at an appropriate, later stage of the raction sequence possible.<br><br><br>
Furthermore, derivatives of general formula 59 in which R4 signifies hydroxymethyl can be prepared by hydroxymethylating compounds of general formula 60 analogously to the process of K.Willcocks et al. described in Journal of Labelled Compounds and Radiopharmaceuticals Vol. XXXIII, No.8, 783-794 (1993).<br>
Furthermore, there exists the possibility of preparing derivatives of general formula 57 starting from correspondingly substituted acetonedicarboxylic acid derivatives by a reaction with succindialdehyde and an amine analogously to procedures known in the literature, with the corresponding tropinone derivative being synthesized.   The substituted acetone¬dicarboxylic acid derivatives used as starting materials can be prepared according to the procedures described by l.lto and S.I.Nagai in Chem.Pharm.Bull. 22(9) 2131 (1974) or T.Arslan and S.A.Benner in J.Org.Chem. 58, 2260 (1993).<br><br><br>
One possible synthetic route to 4-aryl-piperidines which are substituted in each of positions 3 and 5 with 0 or N atoms is shown in Scheme 10.   Oxirane compounds of general formula LXI can be formed from olefins 6, for example, via a bromohydrin which is formed as an intermediate and which can be obtained by the addition of bromine in aqueous dioxan.   Subsequently, the bromohydrin can be ring-closed to the epoxide 61 by the addition<br><br>
of aqueous sodium hydroxide solution.   Treatment of such an oxirane with methyllithlum, butyllithium or a lithium amide in aprotic solvents such as ether or tetrahydrofuran at temperatures between -80°C  and +6O°C  leads to allyl alcohols 62. which, with a free OH or after the introduction of an ether function R20, can be further processed.   Hydroboration of these allyl alcohol derivatives 62., as described earlier for the preparation of compounds of general formula Z, yields the free or monofunction-alized dihydroxy derivatives 63..   For the structural variation of the group R20 (R4azi. or H), -ZR1 and Ra, depending on the target molecule being prepared, groups R20 and -ZRi can be introduced in a different sequence and group Ra can be modified to Rb, a group of the general formula -T1-L2-T2-L3-T3-L4-T4-U.   It can be advisable to provide one of the two OH functions intermediately with a protecting group and to cleave this off at a later stage of the synthesis or to choose the groups -ZR1 and R20 such that, if desired, it is possible to synthesize another desired substituent at a suitable later stage of the reaction sequence.   Starting from monoether-protected derivatives 65 the free OH function can, for example, be stereochemically inverted by reaction with formic acid, triphenylphosphine and an azodicarboxylic acid ester in an inert solvent such as tetrahydrofuran according to Mitsunobu [Synthesis 1981, 1], with compounds of general formula M being obtained.   The use of diphenylphosphoryl azide in place of formic acid under similar conditions provides a possibility of introducing, starting from compounds 66 by a renewed inversion at the same centre, an azido function which can be converted into a primary amino function, for example, by reduction with triphenylphosphine/water in tetrahydrofuran at temperatures between room temperature and 80°C  [Synth. Commun. 17, 377 (1987)].  There are thus obtained compounds of general formula 67. which can be subsequently alkylated or acylated.<br><br><br><br>
In accordance with Scheme 11 cinnamic acid derivatives ^, which are known from the literature, can be converted with malonic acid monoester monoamides 63. in protic solvents such as ethanol or methanol or aprotic solvents such as N,N-dimethyl-formamide, dimethyl sulphoxide, tetrahydrofuran or acetonitrile using bases such as, for example, potassium tert-butylate or sodium hydride at temperatures between room temperature and 130°C  into cyclic imides 70.   Reduction of these imides 70 with hydride reducing reagents such as lithium aluminium hydride, diisobutyl aluminium hydride or sodium dihydrido-bis-(2-methoxyethoxy)aluminate in aprotic solvents such as ethers, tetrahydrofuran or dioxan at temperatures between room temperature and 120°C  yields the piperidine mono- and dimethanols Zl, which can be provided at the piperidine nitrogen with a suitable protecting groups.   Mono- and dihydroxy compounds of general formula 71 can now be selectively functionalized stepwise in an analogous manner to that described earlier for mono- and dihydroxy compounds Z, 10., 62., 6.2., 64 or by conversion into the corresponding bromo, chloro or iodo compounds or aryl- or alkylsulphonic acid esters and subsequent nucleophilic substitution with alcoholates, phenolates or thiophenolates according to conventional methods.   Thereby, ZRl, Z1R4a can represent substituents as defined earlier in general formula I or suitable precursors, which are inert under the reaction conditions or in which reactive groups are present in appropriately protected form, preferably chosen such that, if desired, it is possible to synthesize another desired substituent at a suitable later stage of the reaction sequence.   Ra and Rb correspond to the definitions set forth above.   Alternatively, monohydroxy compounds Zl, dihydroxy compounds Zl or derivatives 73. of the dihydroxy compounds Zi, the hydroxy function of which has been structurally modified, can be converted into the aldehydes Zd by oxidation, for example according to Swern (dimethyl sulphoxide, oxalyl choride) [J. Org. Chem. 43, 2480 (1978)].  Addition of a Grignard compound or lithium compound according to known methodology in an inert solvent such as tetrahydrofuran or 1,2-dimethoxyethane at temperatures between -78°C  and room temperature then yields<br><br>
the alcohols 76. (R9 = H), which can be optionally alkylated, acylated or again oxidized, for example according to Swern, and thus give derivatives 76. (R9 other than H) or, respectively ketones ZZ-  Compounds of general formula 73. and 80 can be obtained starting from dihydroxy compounds 71 by simultaneous conversion of both hydroxy functions analogously to that described above via dialdehydes 715..   The transformation of aldehydes 74, 75. into ketones ZZ, 80. can also be effected via an oxidation to the acids [for example with sodium chlorite, amidosulphonic acid and isopropenyl acetate in a solvent such as acetone/water at 0°C  to room temperature according to J. Am, Chem Soc. 110, 2242 (1988)], subsequent amide coupling to N-methyl-N-methoxy amides with N,0-dimethylhydroxylamine according to known methods as well as reaction thereof with organolithium or organomagnesium compounds in an inert solvent such as tetrahydrofuran or 1,2-dimethoxyethane at temperatures between -78°C  and room temperature as described, for example, in [Synthesis 1986, 944].  Ketones ZZ can be converted into oximes ZE in which R10 can have the significance defined in general formula I by reaction with optionally substituted hydroxylamine derivatives in a solvent such as pyridine in the presence of catalytic or stoichiometric amounts of a strong acid at temperatures between room temperature and 120°C .<br><br><br><br>
Compounds of general formulae 88. and 90, which contain heterocyclic substituents in the 4-position of the piperidine ring, can be synthesized stepwise in accordance with Scheme 12, e.g. as described hereinafter.<br>
4-Heteroaryl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydro-pyridine  derivatives M can be obtained, for example, from 1,2,3,6-tetrahydro-pyridine derivatives 81 activated in the form of an enol triflate by condensation with suitable functionalized heteroaromatic compounds activated, for example, in the form of tin compounds. Coupling reactions of this type are preferably carried out in an inert solvent such as 1,2-dimethoxyethane, tetrahydrofuran or N,N-dimethylformamide using a catalyst such as tetrakis-(triphenylphosphine)-palladium at temperatures up to 130°C .  In place of tin compounds there can also be used analogous boric acid derivatives 82. under comparable reaction conditions or a vinyl-tin compound 81. which is analogous to the enol triflate 8J_ can be reacted with heterocyclic halo compounds or triflates 82. likewise under comparable conditions; in both cases the reactions lead to the same products.    4-Heteroaryl-l ,2,3,6-tetrahydro-pyridine derivatives 86. can, however, also be obtained from pyridyl-heteroaryl-biaryl derivatives such as 84: according to known methods: N-methylation, partial hydrogenation of the methylated pyridine ring with a suitable hydride reagent such as sodium borohydride and subsequent conversion of the N-methyl function into a suitable protecting group by demethylating carbamoylation [as described, for example, in J. Org. Chem. 49, 2081 (1984)].<br>
Compounds of general formulae 87 and 89 can be obtained by hydroboration and subsequent basic oxidative working-up of compounds of general formulae 83. and 86-  The hydroboration can be effected according to methods known per se, for example in a solvent which is inert under the reaction conditions, such as an ether, e.g. 1,2-dimethoxyethane, at a temperature between about 0°C  and 70°C , and with a reagent which contains or liberates diborane, such as e.g. borane in tetrahydrofuran, borane-dimethyl sulphide or a mixture of sodium borohydride and boron trifluoride<br><br>
etherate.   The carboboranes which are formed as intermediates can be converted into the secondary alcohols of general formula 87 and 89. by reaction with bases, e.g. potassium hydroxide, and an oxidizing agent, e.g. hydrogen peroxide, sodium perborate or sodium percarbonate, with a combination of base and oxidizing agent or with trimethylamine N-oxide without the addition of base at a temperature between about room temperature and 120°C .<br>
Compounds of general formulae 88. and 9.0 in which -ZRi represents a substituent containing an aryl or heteroaryl function can be obtained from compounds of general formulae 8Z and 89. by alkylation with a compound which yields the group -ZRi, Alkylation of the secondary alcohol is effected according to methods known per se, for example in a solvent which is inert under the reaction conditions, such as an ether, e.g. tetrahydro-furan or 1,2-dimethoxyethane, or dimethylformamide, with the aid of an alcoholate-forming base, e.g. sodium hydride, at a temperature between about 0°C  and 400°C  and using a halide, preferably a chloride or bromide, or a sulphonic acid ester, e.g. a mesylate or tosylate, as the compound which yields -ZRl.  The group Ra can be structurally modified prior to or after the alkylation described above.   Modification reactions of group Ra to Rb, a group of the general formula   -TT-L2-T2-L3-T3-L4-T4-U, include usual transformation reactions such as removal and re-introduction of a functional group, alkylation and acylation of alcohol and amine functions, oxidations of sulphides to sulphoxides and sulphones as well as other transformation reactions which are well d0°C umented in the literature.   Examples of specific structural transformations of group Ra to group RP are compiled in Scheme 13:<br><br><br><br>
2-Methylsulphonyl pyridine and pyrimidine derivatives 91, which are already appropriately substituted in the 3-position of the piperidine, can be converted into the correspondingly substituted heteroaryl compounds with aicoholates, thiolates and amines in tetrahydrofuran, 1,2-dimethoxyethane, dimethyl-formamide or dimethyl sulphoxide at temperatures between room temperature and about 150°C .   Phenolic pyridine or pyrazine derivatives 92., which have a OH or OZRl function in the 3-position of the piperidine, can be alkylated at the phenolic 0 function using a base and an alkylating agent according to known methods, in which case varying amounts of N-alkylation products can result.   On the other hand, when the reaction is carried out with an alcohol in the presence of triphenylphosphine and an azodicarboxylic acid ester in a solvent such as tetrahydrofuran or 1,2-dimethoxyethane according to Mitsunobu [Synthesis 1981, 1], then O-alkylation products are formed almost exclusively. Accordingly, in the reaction products of general formulae 93-96 -OR22, -R6NR22 and -SR22 each represent a group -T 1-L2-T2-I_3-T3-L4-T4_U, in which T1 = oxygen, nitrgen or sulphur.<br><br><br><br>
Compounds of general formulae 104. 105 as wel as 108 to 110 can be obtained from oxirane compounds 98. in accordance with Scheme 14.  Oxirane compounds 98 can be obtained by oxidation of the corresponding olefins by means of peracids such as peracetic acid or perbenzoic acid, preferably 3-chloro-perbenzoic acid.  They can be converted into azido compounds 101 with azide anions in protic solvents such as ethanol or methanol or in aprotic solvents such as N,N-dimethylformamide, aceto-nitrile or dimethyl sulphoxide with or without the addition of Lewis acids such as lithium perchlorate or magnesium sulphate at temperatures between 50°C  and 150°C, with varying amounts of epoxide-opened products having the azido function in the 3-position and the OH function in the 4-position of the piperidine ring being formed.   The undesired isomeric compounds having the azido function in the 3-position of the piperidine ring can be separated, for example, by chromatography on silica gel.   After the introduction of a suitable ether function in the 3-position the azido compounds can be converted by condensation with a suitable acetylene compound 103. such as, for example, propargyl alcohol in an apolar solvent such as toluene or xylene at temperatures between 60°C  and 160°C , into the two isomeric N-triazolyl compounds of general formulae 104 and 105.  Both give potent renin inhibitors after the introduction of a suitable side-chain on the substituents of the triazole ring using specific modification reactions of group Ra to Rb such as removal and re-introduction of a functional group, alkylation and acylation of alcohol and amine functions, oxidations of sulphides to sulphoxides and sulphones as well as other transformations which are well d°C umented in the literature and after cleavage of the protecting group on the nitrogen atom of the piperidine ring.   Compounds of general formula 106 can be synthesized by the nudeophilic opening of oxiranes of general formula 98. with an anion obtained from the substituted pyridone.   The nudeophilic opening can be effected according to methods known per se, for example in a solvent which is inert under the reaction conditions, such as e.g. aceto-nitrile,  1,2-dimethoxyethane or N,N-dimethylformamide, at a temperature between about room temperature and 120°C  and using a catalyst, e.g. ammonium chloride or lithium perchlorate.<br><br>
with the isomeric epoxide-opened product which °C curs in varying amounts conveniently being separated by chromatography on silica gel.   Compounds of general formula 109 can be obtained starting from compounds of general formula 98. by firstly performing a nucleophilic opening of the oxiranes by means of cyanide ions to give compounds of formula 99..   The nucleophilic opening can be effected according to methods known per se, for example in a solvent which is inert under the reaction conditions, such as e.g. acetonitrile, 1,2-dimethoxyethane or N,N-dimethyl-formamide, at a temperature between about room temperature and 120°C  and using a catalyst, e.g. ammonium chloride, zinc trifluoroacetate or lithium tetrafluoroborate, especially lithium perchlorate, with the isomeric epoxide-opened product which °C curs in varying amounts conveniently being separated by chromatography on silica gel.   Compounds of general formula 1 07 can be obtained from compounds of general formula 99 by the direct addition of ammonia or via the corresponding thioamides of general formula 100.  The addition can be effected according to methods known per se, for example by reacting the nitrile under pressure with ammonia and ammonium chloride or by reacting sulphuretted hydrogen, preferably in the form of a hydrogen sulphide, with the nitrile to give the thioamide of general formula 100.  This can be further converted, e.g. according to the pr°C edure described in Helv.Chim.Acta Vol. 69, 1224 (1986), by alkylation with methyl iodide or ethyl iodide into the correspond¬ing sulphonium derivative, ammonolysis of which, e.g. with ammonium chloride, leads to the amidine of general formula 107. Compounds of general formula 109 can be prepared by a ring-closure reaction of the amidine of general formula 1 07 with a corresponding malondialdehyde.   The synthesis of the pyrimidine unit can be effected according to pr°C edures known per se, for example by reaction of the amidine with a diacetal or enamine of the 2-substituted malondialdehyde in a solvent which is inert under the reaction conditions, such as e.g. methanol, at a temperature between about room temperature and 120°C .<br>
Depending on the target molecule under preparation, starting from compounds 106 and 109 firstly -ZRi can be<br><br>
introduced and subsequently group Ra can be modified to Rb or a reversed synthetic route can be used.<br>
Scheme 15<br><br>
Compounds of general formula 113 can be obtained from compounds of general formula 99. in accordance with Scheme 1 5 by firstly alkylating the secondary alcohol with a compound which yields the group Z-R1, whereby, if desired, the further synthesis of the desired substituents can be effected at a later stage of the reaction sequence.   The alkylation of the secondary<br><br>
alcohol is effected according to procedures known per se, for example in a solvent which is inert under the reaction conditions, such as an ether, e.g. tetrahydrofuran or 1,2-dimethoxyethane, or dimethylformamide, with the aid of an alcoholate-forming base, e.g. sodium hydride, at a temperature between about 0°C  and 40°C and using a halide, preferably a chloride or bromide, or a sulphonic acid ester, e.g. a mesylate or tosylate, as the compound which yields Z-R1.<br>
The reaction of compounds of general formula 111 with hydroxylamine in the presence of a base such as e.g. sodium methylate, conveniently at temperatures between 40°C  and 100°C , gives amidoxines of general formula 11 2.   Compounds of general formula 11 3 are obtained by reacting a reactive functional derivative of a carboxylic acid of general formula 11 8 with an amidoxime of formula 11 2.   The reaction is conveniently effected by heating for several hours to about 70°C  to 130°C  in an inert solvent, e.g. in dimethylformamide.   The non-cyclized conden¬sation product which is formed as an intermediate cyclizes spontaneously under the given reaction conditions.   As reactive functional derivatives of carboxylic acids of general formula 1 1 8 there can be used the corresponding imidazolides, which can be prepared from the corresponding free carboxylic acids according to procedures known per se, e.g. by reaction with 1,1'-carbonyl-diimidazole in an inert organic solvent, e.g. in dimethyl¬formamide.    Furthermore, as reactive functional derivatives of the carboxylic acids there can also be used carboxylic acid chlorides which can be prepared from the corresponding free carboxylic acids by means of thionyl chloride or oxalyl chloride.<br>
Compounds of general formula 116 can be obtained from compounds of general formula 114 firstly, as mentioned above, by alkylating compounds of general formula 11 5.  These are then converted into reactive, functional derivatives of the carboxylic acid and reacted with hydrazides of general formula 11 9.  The reaction is conveniently effected at room temperature to 50°C in an inert organic solvent, e.g. in dimethylformamide.   The non-cyclized condensation product which thereby results can be<br><br>
isolated and then cyclized to compounds of general formula 11 6 by heating for several hours with polyphosphoric acid at about 100°C .<br>
Compounds of general formula 117 can be obtained from compounds of general formula 11 5 in accordance with Scheme 15 by reacting reactive, functional derivates of the carboxylic acids with amidoximes of general formula 1 20.   The reaction is conveniently effected by heating for several hours to about 70°C to 130°C  in an inert solvent, e.g. in dimethylformaide.  The non-cyclized condensation product which is formed as an intermediate cyclises spontaneously under the given reaction conditions.<br>
The compounds of general formulae 114 and 11 8 - 120 belong to generally known classes of compound and will therefore be readily accessible to any person skilled in the art.<br>
Furthermore, compounds of general formula II in which R2 has the meaning of a 5-membered aromatic group can also be prepared very similarly to the synthesis route described in Scheme 12, in which the specifically functionalized 6-membered aromatic synthone 82. must be replaced by a corresponding 5-membered aromatic synthone.<br>
Piperidines of general formula I can also exist in optically pure form.   Separation into antipodes can be effected according to methods known per se, either preferably at an early stage of the synthesis by salt formation with an optically active acid such as, for example, (+)- or (-)- mandelic acid and separation of the diastereomeric salts by fractional crystallization or preferably at a later stage by derivatization with a chiral auxilary substance such as, for example, (+)- or (-)- camphamoyi chloride and separation of the diastereomeric products by chromatography and/or crystallization and subsequent cleavage of the bond to the chiral auxilary substance.   In order to determine the absolute configuration of the piperidine obtained, the pure diastereomeric salts and derivatives can be analyzed by conventional spectro-<br><br>
scopic methods, with X-ray spectroscopy on single crystals being an especially suitable method.<br>
The compounds of formula I and their pharmaceutically usable salts have an inhibitory activity on the natural enzyme renin.   The latter passes from the kidneys into the blood and there brings about the cleavage of angiotensinogen with the formation of the decapeptide angiotensin I which is then cleaved in the lungs, the kidneys and other organs to the °C tapeptide angiotensin II.   Angiotensin II increases blood pressure not only directly by arterial constriction, but also indirectly by the liberation of the sodium ion-retaining hormone aldosterone from the adrenal gland, with which is ass°C iated an increase in the extracellular fluid volume.   This increase is attributed to the action of agiotensin II itself or to the hepapeptide angiotensin III which is formed therefrom as a cleavage product.   Inhibitors of the enzymatic activity of renin bring about a decrease in the formation of angiotensin I and as a consequence of this the formation of a smaller amount of angiotensin II.   The reduced concentration of this active peptide hormone is the direct reason for the blood pressure-lowering activity of renin inhibitors.<br>
The in-vivo potency   of renin inhibitors can, as described by W.Fischli et al. in Hypertension, Vol. 18 (1), 22-31 (1991) or Hypertension Vol. 22 (1), 9-17 (1993) be demonstrated experimentally by means of the tests described hereinafter. The tests can be carried out in analogy to those described by D.T.Pals et al. in Hypertension Vol 8, 1105-1112 (1986) or J.Boger et al. in J.Med.Chem. 28, 1779-1790 (1985) or J.F.Dellaria et al. in J.Med.Chem. 30, 2137-2144 (1987) or T.Kokubu et al. in Bi°C hem.Biophys.Res.Commun. 118, 929-933 (1984).<br>
In vitro test with pure human renin<br>
The test is carried out in Eppendorf test tubes.   The incubation mixture consists of (1) 100 ml of human renin in buffer A (0.1 M sodium phosphate solution, pH 7.4, containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% sodium azide and 1   mM ethylene-<br><br>
diaminetetraacetic acid), sufficient for a renin activity of 2-3 ng of angiotensin l/ml/hr.; (2) 145 ml of buffer A: (3) 30 ml of 10 mM human tetradecapeptide renin substrate (hTD) in 10 mM hydr°C hloric acid: (4) 15 mi of dimethyl sulphoxide with or without inhibitor and (5) 10 ml of a 0.03  molar solution of hydroxyquinoline sulphate in water.<br>
The samples are incubated for three hours at 37°C and, respectively, 4°C in triplicate.   2 x 100 ml samples per test tube are used in order to measure the production of angiotensin I via RIA (standard radioimmunoassay; clinical assay solid phase kit). Cross reactivities of the antibody used in the RIA are: angiotensin I 100%; angiotensin II 0.0013%; hTD (angiotensin l-Val-lle-His-Ser-OH) 0.09%.   The production of angiotensin I is determined by the difference between the test at 37°C  and that at 4°C .<br>
The following controls are carried out:<br>
(a)	Incubation of hTD samples without renin and without inhibitor at 37°C and 4°C .  The difference between these two values gives the base value of the angiotensin I production.<br>
(b)	Incubation of hTD samples with renin, but without inhibitor at 37°C and 4°C.  The difference between these values gives the maximum value of the angiotensin I production.<br>
In each sample the base value of the angiotensin I production is subtracted from the angiotensin I production which is determined.   The difference between the maximum value and the base value gives the value of the maximum substrate hydrolysis (= 100%) by renin.<br>
The results are given as IC50 values which denote that concentration of the inhibitor at which the enzymatic activity is inhibited by 50%.   The IC50 values are determined from a linear regression curve from a logit-log plot.<br><br>

In general, in the case of oral administration a daily dosage of about 3 mg to about 3 g, preferably about 10 mg to about 1   g, e.g. approximately 300 mg per adult person (70 kg), divided into preferably 1-3 individual doses which e.g. can be of equal amount, should be sufficient, although the upper limit given can also be exceeded when this is found to be indicated.   Usually, children receive a reduced dose appropriate to their age and body weight.<br>
