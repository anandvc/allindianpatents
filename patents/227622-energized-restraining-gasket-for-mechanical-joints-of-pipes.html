FOR MECHANICAL JOINTS OF PIPES<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br><br>
This invention relates generally to a restraining gasket for mechanical joint of pipes.<br>
More particularly, the invention is directed toward a device and<br>
method of connecting two lengths of pipe that maximizes the advantages of both restrained<br>
push-on joints as well as mechanical joints, as are known commonly in the art. The invention<br>
has application to long-run pipe lengths as well as fittings, appurtenances, and connections.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
Due to thrust forces, earth movement, and external mechanical forces exerted<br>
on pipes, the industry has focused substantial attention on the problem of maintaining<br>
connections between adjacent lengths of pipe after installation. The result of this attention is<br>
a library of differing solutions and approaches known in the art. The majority of these<br>
solutions can be categorized as either "push-on" joints or "mechanical joints." References to<br>
"pipe" made by the inventor with respect to application or use of the present invention shall<br>
be understood to include fittings, connections, and any other appurtenances to pipes.<br>
The most common connection device used in the art for connection of<br>
straight-run lengths of pipe is a "push-on" pipe/bell configuration. These push-on solutions<br>
are exemplified by U.S. Patent No 2.953, 398 and account for the majority of straight-run<br>
pipe connections. In a typical configuration, a spigot end of a pipe slides into a bell end of<br>
another pipe past a tightly fitted gasket. No follower ring, stuffing box, or other external<br>
compression means typically is present in a push-on joint. Additionally, the typical push-on<br>
joint does not include a restraining means, though such means as tie bars, concrete thrust<br>
blocks, screws, and additional ring attachments have been employed in some cases to effect<br>
restraining to the joints. Advancements in the art have led to innovations and modifications<br>
of push-on joints to. include restraining means. Examples of such restrained push-on<br><br>
joints include U.S. Patent Nos. 5,295,697: 5.464.228; and 5,067-251. The securement of the<br>
connection in such advancements may be effected by locking segments or wedges within the<br>
gasket that engage the spigot. The locking segments are oriented in such a manner as to<br>
allow entry of the spigot into the bell, but upon counterforces tending to effect removal of<br>
the spigot, the segments pivot toward a biting engagement with the spigot, stopping further<br>
removal. The effect is much like a child's "finger lock" toy, the stronger the attempt to<br>
remove the pipe, the greater the locking effect exerted by the inserts. These push-on type<br>
joints enjoy superior flexibility and resistance to both axial and para-axial separative forces.<br>
Meaningful difficulty has been experienced in the industry, however, in applying these<br>
connections to fittings, where it may be impracticable to secure the fitting sufficiently to<br>
exert the high installation pressures necessary initially to push the spigot into the bell in such<br>
configurations.<br>
A "mechanical joint" is a well-known standardized connection device widely<br>
employed in the pipe industry. Such a joint fluid-seals two lengths of pipe together by<br>
compressing a gasket around a spigot and within a bell at the intersection. Mechanical joints<br>
are characterized by an outwardly flanged bell of a receiving pipe, into which a spigot of a<br>
second pipe is inserted. The bell is adapted to seat a gasket that fits snugly about the<br>
circumference of the spigot of the second pipe, and further to receive a supporting<br>
compression ring or gland. In assembly, the spigot is fully advanced into the bell and the<br>
gasket is firmly seated within the bell and around the spigot. The gland is then forced<br>
against the gasket by fastening it securely to the bell flange through such means as fastening<br>
bolts tightened under relatively high torque. This configuration typically includes a lip about<br>
the inner diameter of the gland that upon securement extends axially within the bell. The<br>
configuration of the gland is such that as the lip is forced against the gasket, the gasket<br>
becomes compressed under pressures sufficient to deform the gasket. As the gasket is<br>
compressed between the bell and the gland, the gasket therefore is squeezed inwards toward<br>
and into sealing contact with both the exterior of the inserted pipe section and the interior of<br>
the bell. This deformation enhances the sealing effectiveness of the gasket beyond that<br>
which can be readily obtained in the absence of compression or high insertion forces<br>
The mechanical joint enjoys wide acceptance in the industry, and is the<br>
subject of national and international standards such as ANSI/AWWA C111/A21.11-95<br>
Given the industry affinity for such joints and the embedded nature of these standards into<br><br>
specifications, any mechanical joint should conform to these specifications to gain optimal<br>
acceptance. Numerous attempts have been made to improve upon the standardized<br>
mechanical joint. These attempts are almost uniformly characterized by the inclusion of an<br>
additional mechanism or attachment, creating a mechanical connection resistive to<br>
separation of the pipes. Such attempts that require modification of the bell or gland (or both)<br>
are exemplified by U.S. Patent No. 784.400 to Howe, which employs locking inserts<br>
recessed within the gland; U.S. Patent No. 1,818,493, to McWane, which discloses a<br>
modified gland that relies upon specially modified bolts having toothed cams that both pivot<br>
on and bite into the spigot as the bolts are hooked under a modified lip of the bell and forced<br>
into grooves in the gland.<br>
Further solutions employ additional restraining devices or teeth interposed<br>
between the gasket and the gland, which are driven into the spigot as the gland is tightened.<br>
Included among these devices are U.S. Patent No. 4,664,426, to Ueki; and U.S. Patent No.<br>
5,297,826, to Percebois, which each require the use of multiple additional locking devices in<br>
addition to the standard mechanical joint's simple bell-gasket-gland configuration. U.S.<br>
Patent No. 4,878,698, to Gilchrist, U.S. Patent 5,335,946, toJDent, et al, and U.S. Patent No.<br>
5.398.946. to Hunter, et al., appear susceptible to, possible early engagement of the biting<br>
teeth prior to full seating of the gland. U.S. Patent No. 5,803,513, to Richardson and others<br>
attempt to solve this potential problem by use of sacrificial skid pads to prevent early<br>
engagement of the teeth.<br>
Additional solutions employ a bolting assembly attached to (or incorporated<br>
into) the bell, which assembly is oriented such that upon tightening of certain specially<br>
configured bolts, the bolts or a device actuated thereby are driven into the outer surface of<br>
the spigot. These bolting schemes are exemplified by devices sold by EBAA Iron,<br>
commonly known in the art under the trademark MEGALUG (Registration No. 1383971)<br>
Further examples of this type of solution include U.S. Patent No. 4,647,083, to Hashimoto,<br>
which modifies the standard gland to include bolts that act upon locking wedges when<br>
tightened. When a pipe is installed in a ground-bedded environment, it is typically<br>
inconvenient to have multiple additional bolting requirements on the underside of the pipe as<br>
laid. Such underside boltings increase the cost and time of installation. If, however, the<br>
bolt-in locking scheme employs only a few bolt locations, the inward pressure of the bolts<br>
may in some conditions tend to deform the cross-sectional profile of the spigot. For<br><br>
example, employment of only three bolt locations in some circumstances may exhibit an<br>
undesirable possibility of deforming the spigot into a slightly triangular shape.<br>
It will be noted by those reasonably skilled in the art that each of these<br>
configurations also suffers from practical issues, such as the expense of manufacture of<br>
additional components and the fact that additional components increase the potential for<br>
unacceptable failure.<br>
Furthermore, each of these solutions may be considered a "static" connection.<br>
Although pipelines are traditionally considered to be rigid and immobile structures, a durable<br>
connection must allow for a certain amount of flexibility and "play" at joints; Such<br>
accommodation to movement is necessary because the environments in which pipelines lay<br>
are not truly static. Thrust forces may create non-longitudinal, or para-axial loads that tend<br>
to drive a pipe length toward an angle from the longitudinal axis of the lengths to either side<br>
of such axis. As the pressures of the material being transported within the pipe vary, the<br>
forces will similarly vary. Additionally, locations in which pipes are run rarely are as stable<br>
as commonly believed. In fact, pipes may be run above ground, in which cases such pipes<br>
do not enjoy the benefit of any stability enhancing factors of bedding or trenched<br>
installation. Finally, even typical earth-bedded pipes must endure shifting due to<br>
sedimentation, erosion, compaction, mechanical forces (such as nearby construction), and<br>
earth movement (such as earthquakes).<br>
A variation of the push-on joint is evidenced by U.S. Patent No. 2,201,372, to<br>
Miller, which employs a compression snap-ring fitted within a special lip of the bell, in order<br>
to exert pressure onto the locking segments and thus drive them into the spigot. Alternatives<br>
in Miller similarly drive locking segments into the spigot upon installation. U.S. Patent No.<br>
3,445,120, to Barr, likewise employs a gasket with stiffening segments completely encased<br>
therein that are generally disposed in a frustroconical arrangement. Such segments are stated<br>
to give the gasket a resistance to compression along the plane that includes both ends of the<br>
segment. When a spigot is subjected to withdrawing forces, the gasket rolls with the<br>
movement of the pipe. As the gasket rolls, it is intended to eventually encounter a position<br>
in which the stiffened plane needs to compress for further rolling. In optimal conditions, due<br>
to the stiffening, the gasket cannot compress and therefore cannot roll further. As the rolling<br>
stops, the gasket becomes a static friction-based lock between the spigot and the bell.<br><br>
Notably, among other distinctions, the arrangement taught by Barr remains a rubber-to-pipe<br>
frictional connection.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
The following stated objects of the invention are alternative and exemplary<br>
objects only, and no one or any should be read as required for the practice of the invention,<br>
or as an exhaustive listing of objects accomplished.<br>
As suggested by the foregoing discussion, an an exemplary and non-exclusive<br>
alternative object of this invention is to provide a gasket interchangeable with gaskets of<br>
standard mechanical joints which allows for the transformation of the joint into a restrained<br>
joint without the need for any reconfiguration or adaptation of the bell, spigot, or gland of<br>
the mechanical joint involved.<br>
A further exemplary and non-exclusive alternative object is to provide a<br>
dynamic connection for pipes that does not require high insertion pressures.<br>
A further exemplary and non-exclusive alternative object of the invention is<br>
to provide for a cost effective manner and device of restraining a typically configured pipe<br>
joint.<br>
The above objects and advantages are neither exhaustive nor each<br>
individually critical to the spirit and practice of the invention.<br>
Other objects and advantages of the present intention will become apparent to<br>
those skilled in the art from the following description of the invention.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention may be described basically as a gasket converting a<br>
standard mechanical joint into a restrained mechanical joint without the need for altered<br>
configuration of the bell, spigot, or gland of the joint, and without the need for additional<br>
fittings or devices. In the practice of the present invention, a standard mechanical joint's bell<br>
and gland configuration can be employed to connect a spigot end of one pipe length to the<br><br>
bell end of another pipe length in a restrained relationship (restraint being defined as<br>
resistance to axial separation of a mated bell and spigot), with the restraint based on forces<br>
superior to rubber-to-pipe friction. In more particular discussion of some of the<br>
embodiments taught, the invention includes forming the gasket to fit within the bell in such a<br>
manner that a void exists during rest, into which void the gasket deforms, which in turn<br>
influences the rotational motion of the segment. In this manner, the configuration of the<br>
gasket influences the timing and extent of rotation during the process of securing the gland<br>
to the bell. Overpenetration may be avoided, while at the same time ensuring sufficient<br>
penetration at the proper moment in time. Controlling the timing and extent of locking<br>
segment rotation influences gasket performance and is addressed by the described<br>
embodiments of this invention. The extent of segment rotation affects the application of<br>
restraint. Once restraint occurs, which typically is when the segment has rotated into an<br>
interference position between bell and spigot, further meaningfully helpful gasket<br>
compression typically no longer occurs. Rotating the segment too early yields insufficient<br>
gasket compression for adequate sealing. Rotating the segment too late may not sufficiently<br>
restrain the joint.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The following is a detailed description of the invention. Those skilled in the<br>
art will understand that the specificity provided herein is intended for illustrative purposes<br>
with respect to the inventor's most preferred embodiment, and is not to be interpreted as<br>
limiting the scope of the invention. References to "pipe" herein shall be understood equally<br>
to refer to any pipe length, appurtenance, fitting, or any other connected device or element<br>
regardless of the method or material of manufacture.<br>
Turning now to the drawings, Figure 1 presents a diagram of a typical<br>
mechanical joint. Assembly of the joint according to the current invention is practiced as<br>
known in the art. Particularly, but without limitation of the known variants which shall be as<br>
equally applicable to the present invention as they are to the known art, the joint contains the<br>
following elements in the following relationship. Compression ring or gland 11 is placed on<br>
spigot 10, following which gasket 2 is placed around the exterior of spigot 10. Spigot 10 is<br>
then advanced within bell 12 until the end 41 of spigot 10 is stopped by an annular shoulder<br>
42 within bell 12. Gasket 2 is advanced into bell 12 until it seats in the annular recess seat<br>
43, as shown. Gland 11 is then abutted against gasket 2 and is secured to bell 12 by<br>
securing devices 44, which are presented for illustration here as bolts 45 passing through<br>
perforations 46 and engaged by nuts 47. As is evident, upon drawing up or tightening of<br>
nuts 47, gland 11 is compressed against gasket 2, causing it to compress. Alternative<br>
securing means will be apparent to those in the industry, such as overcenter clamps, cam<br>
locks, ramped wedges, ramped annular rings, and rivets, and could include any mechanism<br>
that may be used to decrease the axial spacing between the gland 11 and the bell 12.<br><br>
Due to the constraining presence of recess seat 43 and gland 11, deforming of gasket 2 may<br>
be directed primarily radially inward toward and into sealing engagement with spigot 10.<br>
The invention of the present disclosure builds upon this interrelationship and requires no<br>
changes to the spigot, bell, or gland, though such changes may be accommodated within the<br>
spirit of the invention if such modifications are otherwise desired.<br>
As will be known in the art, traditional understanding counsels that the profile<br>
of the gasket 2 in a resting state substantially match with the internal profile of the bell 12 at<br>
the location in which the gasket 2 is intended to reside in final assembly. The purpose of<br>
such matching profiles is to allow for tight mating of the gasket 2 into the bell 12 to enhance<br>
fluid seal. In the shown embodiment, this conventional wisdom would counsel for the<br>
radially outward profile of the gasket 2 to have approximately the same configuration as<br>
recess seat 43 of bell 12. As shown in Figure 1, in a resting state the primary mating<br>
surfaces of a prior art gasket would mate smoothly with the internal surfaces of the bell 12.<br>
Accordingly, in prior art gaskets, following assembly the profile of the gasket at these areas<br>
of sealing interface is substantially the same as the profile of the gasket in the resting state.<br>
As is depicted in Figures 2 and 8, the locking segment 1 of the present<br>
invention may be constructed to fit within a gasket 2 that is configured to fit within any<br>
standard mechanical joint without necessitating changes to the configuration of the bell,<br>
gland, or spigot. Gasket 2 is an elastomeric or other resilient or deformable material, such as<br>
those in the art will understand may be used in the practice of a mechanical joint. A useful<br>
configuration of the gasket 2, as shown in Figure 3, is an annular ring with a radially inner<br>
surface 4 that is adapted to be in contact with spigot 10, a gland face 7 that is adapted to be<br>
compressed by a gland or compression ring 11, a front face 61 that leads in axial insertion,<br>
and a radially outer surface, shown in the drawings as having a configuration that does not<br>
mate smoothly with the recess seat 43 in a resting state. Particularly, in the shown<br>
embodiment, the radially outer surface of the gasket 2 has a compression seat surface 9 at the<br>
leading portion of the gasket 2 near the front face 61 that is designed to mate with and seal<br>
against an area of the recess seat 43. Also characterizing the shown embodiment is a<br>
distortion control surface 62 that in the resting state leads away from the recess seat 43 to<br>
form a radially depressed gutter 63, before the profile of the gasket 2 extends once again<br>
radially outward to meet the bell 12 in the area of rear seal 64. Although these surfaces are<br>
readily distinguishable in the drawings and as discussed herein, though the transition among<br><br>
surfaces may not be as readily apparent in the uncompressed state as in the configuration<br>
shown. In the shown embodiments, gasket 2 conforms to all of the requirements of<br>
ANSI/AWWA C111/A21.11-95. In particular, for any given spigot 10, gasket 2 tends to<br>
have a slightly smaller inner diameter than the outer diameter of the spigot 10. Accordingly,<br>
placement of gasket 2 over the exterior of spigot 10 typically will require exertion of force to<br>
expand gasket 2 to fit around spigot 10.<br>
Alternatively described, it will be noted that the gutter 63, being an annular<br>
depression (radially speaking) is characterized by the fact that if gasket 2 is advanced into<br>
the bell 12 as fully as is possible in the resting state (e.g., prior to deformation), and rotated<br>
to contact the bell 12 in the area of the recess-seat 43 as much as possible without<br>
deformation, a void remains between the gasket 2 and the recess seat 43; such depression or<br>
void is the gutter 63. As shown Figures 2, 3 and 4 in this embodiment a portion of the gutter<br>
63 remains vacant of gasket material, even during some advanced stages of compression and<br>
assembly. It will be noted that the gutter 63 in other embodiments could be covered by a<br>
film of rubber or otherwise be a void below the radially outward surface of gasket 2, and still<br>
be and operate as a gutter 63 in the spirit and scope of the invention.<br>
Without limiting the application of the structure, effects, or scope of the<br>
invention or other possible advantages of practice of the invention, the operational aspects of<br>
having this void are believed in the shown embodiment to confer at least two advantages,<br>
either of which alone would be an advance in the art. (It should be noted that applicant does<br>
not limit the invention by this discussion to only embodiments that possess one or more of<br>
these advantages. First, the compression of compression seat surface 9 shown in Fig 3 and separately of<br>
distortion control surface 62, against recess seat 43 in different locations is believed to create<br>
two separate areas of sealing, with gradients of compression between the points of initial<br>
contact with the recess-seat 43, such that sealing efficiency is enhanced. Also, rear seal 64<br>
in compressive contact with gasket land 49 may create yet another area of sealing. This<br>
appears to create maximum pressure against at least one point in the area of the gasket 2,<br>
which serves to resist high fluid escape pressures, while still taking advantage of the<br>
flexibility and other advantages of high surface-area, lower-pressure sealing.<br>
A second perceived benefit is an operational effect on the motion of the<br>
segment 1, which is described in more detail, below.<br><br>
Gasket 2 incorporates at least one locking segment 1, which may be<br>
configured as shown in Figure 5, also shown as embedded in the gasket 2 in Figure 8. In the<br>
usual practice of the invention, a number of locking segments 1 will be circumferentially<br>
dispersed about and within gasket 2, and though preferable, the placement need not be<br>
precisely or even nearly symmetrical. The number of such segments 1 may be selected with<br>
reference to the expected separative forces to be encountered by the joint, with a higher force<br>
tending to recommend a larger number of segments 1. The inventor prefers to use no fewer<br>
than three such segments 1, but the invention is not so limited. For example, a preferred<br>
configuration of segments 1 for use with a pipe of eight inch diameter intended to carry<br>
fluids at pressures of 350 p.s.i. includes eight to ten segments 1 uniformly spaced around the<br>
spigot-facing circumference of gasket 2 (e.g., the radially inner surface 4). An alternative<br>
would allow a single segment 1 of a circumference appreciable to (at least one-half the size<br>
of) the circumference of gasket 2.<br>
Separative forces (shown diagramatically as vectors 50, 50a and 50b in<br>
Figure 1) tend to extract spigot 10 from bell 12. As indicated by directional arrow 50, some<br>
separative forces follow in-line with the common axis of assembled pipe lengths. Other<br>
separative forces are para-axial, as shown by vectors 50a and 50b, which may be due to<br>
bedding shifting or non-uniform securement around the periphery of spigot 10. Segment 1<br>
is intended to grip spigot 10 and to translate separative forces into forces at least partially<br>
opposing bell 12. To this end, segment 1 possesses teeth 6 that are adapted to protrude from<br>
inner surface 4 of gasket 2, at least upon compression of gasket 2 by gland 11. Teeth 6 are<br>
adapted to contact spigot 10, and are most preferably fashioned of a substance that is harder<br>
than the material comprising the exterior of spigot 10. In a particular embodiment, teeth 6<br>
are, in the uncompressed state of gasket 2, already exposed from the inner surface 4 as<br>
shown by Figure 8. This exposure may be by protrusion from the inner surface 4, or by<br>
slight recessing beneath inner surface 4 in combination with the absence of gasket material<br>
covering the teeth, which is the embodiment shown in Figure 3 and subsequent images. As<br>
shown in Figure 3 and 8, the gasket 2 may be configured with a recess about teeth 6 to<br>
prevent interference with penetration of such teeth 6 into spigot 10. An alternative preferred<br>
embodiment presents teeth 6 slightly recessed within gasket 2, and covered by a membrane<br>
or thin layer of compressible or puncturable material. The inventors suggest that at least<br>
some of the area between teeth 6 or immediately adjacent to teeth 6 be free of rubber<br><br><br><br>
to allow penetration of the spigot 10. An advantage of initial concealment is that it allows<br>
for greater advancement of gland 11, and thus greater compression of gasket 2, prior to<br>
substantial engagement of teeth 6 into spigot 10. A greater sealing effectiveness therefore<br>
may be achieved.<br>
Preferably, segment 1 possesses a plurality of teeth 6. In a tested<br>
configuration, the tips of teeth 6 are arranged in an arcuate relationship. The arcuate<br>
relationship enhances the ability of teeth 6 to bite into spigot 10 despite any variations in<br>
circumference of spigot 10 or the inner dimensions of bell 12. This is because a larger gap<br>
(frequently due to manufacturing tolerances) between spigot 10 and the inner dimensions of<br>
bell 12 (particularly annular gasket recess seat 43) will cause segment 1 in assembly to be<br>
rotated upon compression of gasket 2 toward a steeper angle relative to spigot 10 than exists<br>
in the unstressed configuration as displayed in Figure 2. Given the arcuate relationship of<br>
teeth 6, upon such rotation of segment 1 the most axially inner teeth rotate into contact with<br>
spigot 10. The arcuate configuration further urges at least two teeth 6 to be in contact with<br>
spigot 10, regardless of the rotation of segment 1. This is because in the arcuate<br>
configuration, a straight line can be drawn between any two adjacent teeth 6. Beneficially,<br>
the presence of additional teeth 6 to either side of any biting tooth 6 tends to assist in<br>
preventing overpenetration of the spigot 10 by segment 1, due to the fact that these adjacent<br>
teeth will be pointed at an angle to spigot 10 such that they are not optimally positioned for<br>
biting; rather, adjacent teeth 6 will tend to contact spigot 10 at an angle substantially more<br>
parallel to spigot 10 than those teeth 6 that are biting into spigot 10. Accordingly, because of<br>
the more-parallel angle, adjacent teeth 6 act as stops to further penetration.<br>
In a shown configuration as detailed in Figure 5, segment 1 in cross section<br>
has a toothed edge 16, with teeth 6 extending therefrom in the arcuate pattern as above<br>
discussed; and a back face 13, extending radially and axially along a slope towards<br>
protrusion 17. Back face 13 as shown is adapted to be in a close proximity to, or even in<br>
direct contact with, gland 11 when the mechanical joint is assembled. Connecting protrusion<br>
17 in the axially inner direction with toothed edge 16, is a surface, or a series of surfaces,<br>
denoted compression faces 15. In this embodiment, back face 13 is in close proximity to<br>
gland 11 when the joint is assembled, and upper protrusion 17, being the most radially outer<br>
area of the segment, is in close proximity to gasket land 49 of the bell. A greater volume of<br>
elastomeric material of gasket 2 exists between compression seat surface 9 (particularly<br><br>
shoulder 8) and segment 1 than is present between back face 13 and gland 11.<br>
Upon insertion of spigot 10 into gasket 2, toothed edge 16 of segment 1 may<br>
be forced radially outwardly by the presence of spigot 10, and may cause pivoting of<br>
segment 1. The volume of compressible material present between the segment's<br>
compression faces 15 and recess seat 43 allows for such outward movement or pivoting<br>
without compromising the integrity of gasket 2. Given the arcuate configuration of teeth 6<br>
along toothed edge 16, even when rotated radially outwardly, at least one tooth 6 will be<br>
poised for contact with spigot 10 upon compression (though the inventor recognizes within<br>
the spirit of the invention that any or all of teeth 6 may be removed from direct physical<br>
contact with spigot 10 due to teeth 6 of segment 1 being recessed in gasket 2 or the presence<br>
of a thin layer of elastomeric material, or other substance, so long as the material, or<br>
substance is not sufficient to interfere with the effective grip of at least one of teeth 6 into<br>
spigot 10 upon full compression of gasket 2, as is described below). Spigot 10 may be<br>
advanced as in the prior art until stopped by annular shoulder 42.<br>
Following such insertion of spigot 10 into bell 12, gasket 2 will be in a<br>
position basically as represented in Figure 2, and the gasket 2 may be already in contact with<br>
recess-seat 43 at some point. In any event, substantial compression of gasket 2, as in<br>
compression sufficient to effect the sealing and securement of the joint is not at this point<br>
effected. Further assembly is carried out by advancing of gland lip 71 against the gasket 2<br>
gland face 7, and into the bell 12. As will be evident to those skilled in the art, this advance<br>
of gland 11 will by contact with gasket 2 force gasket 2 inwardly into contact or more<br>
forceful contact with recess seat 43. As shown from Figure 4, gasket 2, and in the shown<br>
embodiment specifically compression seat surface 9, begins deformation against recess-seat<br>
43. Deformation of gasket 2, particularly in the area of distortion control surface 62, begins<br>
to occur in the shown embodiment prior to substantial rotation of segment 1. This phase of<br>
the assembly operation is considered the initial phase and is characterized by substantially<br>
translational motion of the segment. The forces acting on the segment are principally<br>
balanced between gland 11 acting on the back face 13 of segment 1 and the compression<br>
energy stored in the gasket rubber trapped between segment 1, spigot 10 and bell 12. This<br>
compression energy acts on segment 1 at a location known as the "center of pressure" that is<br>
believed in the shown embodiments to be substantially in line with the force vector imparted<br>
by gland 11 acting on segment 1.<br><br>
As gland 11 continues to advance into bell 12 beyond the point shown in<br>
Figure 4, segment 1 begins to rotate. This phase of the assembly operation is the transitional<br>
phase and is characterized by a relatively decreasing amount of translational motion of<br>
segment 1 and a relatively increasing amount of rotational motion of segment 1. In other<br>
words, upper protrusion 17 advances into the bell at a faster rate than teeth 6 for a given<br>
input by gland 11. This occurs because the center of pressure of the compression energy<br>
stored in the gasket moves closer to the teeth 6 of segment 1 and away from upper protrusion<br>
17 as the gasket is compressed. Rotation of segment 1 at this point is influenced by the<br>
gutter 63 and is related to the movement of the center of pressure of the gasket toward teeth<br>
6. Because gutter 63 presents the area of least resistance to compression, and hence to<br>
deformation (it being known in the art that rubber tends to deform, but not to compress), the<br>
upper (as seen in the Figures) portion of the segment 1 rotates toward the gutter 63, reducing<br>
the size of the gutter 63 as the gasket material deforms into the area.<br>
Rotation of segment 1 continues substantially in this manner as the gland 11<br>
advances until the point at which segment 1 is in resistive contact with both spigot 10 and<br>
bell 12. This phase of the assembly operation shall be known as the final phase and in the<br>
shown embodiment is characterized by a substantially rotational motion of segment 1 and a<br>
substantial collapse of gutter 63. This segment and gasket orientation is depicted by Figure<br>
6. The resistive contact in the shown embodiment is specifically between a tooth 6 and<br>
protrusion 17 of segment 1 and the corresponding joint surfaces of spigot 10 and bell 12.<br>
Until the final phase of assembly is entered, if a tooth 6 is in resistive contact with spigot 10,<br>
or protrusion 17 is in resistive contact with, bell 12 it will be understood that this contact is of<br>
a sliding nature. Upon the substantial collapse of gutter 63 and the start of the final phase of<br>
assembly, further gasket deformation is extremely limited which effectively prevents further<br>
translation of segment 1 further in the axial direction. Any additional clamping force applied<br>
to the securing mechanism between gland 11 and bell 12 (e.g. the bolts 44) imparts a large<br>
rotational energy to the segment due to the imbalance between the force vector created by<br>
contact of gland 11 and segment 1 vs. the vector between the center of pressure of gasket 2<br>
and segment 1. Any further rotation of segment 1 now causes a penetration of segment 1<br>
into spigot 10 by teeth 6 and a penetration of segment 1 into bell 12 by protrusion 17 via<br>
plastic deformation of spigot 10 and bell 12. This penetration provides a mechanical lock<br>
between spigot 10 and bell 12 via segment 1 and thus jqint,restraint is obtained.<br><br>
Following installation, it will be evident from the foregoing description that at least one<br>
tooth 6 remains in gripping contact with spigot 10 and protrusion 17 remains in contact with bell<br>
12. Any attempt of the spigot 10 to move outwardly of bell 12 urges at least this one tooth 6 to<br>
move axially outwardly of bell 12 along with spigot 10,but axial movement is not possible due to<br>
the resistive contact between back face 13 and lip 71 of the gland and a rotation of the locking<br>
segment in a direction that exerts axial resistance as well as radial pressure among the segment<br>
1, the bell 12, and the spigot 10. This axial resistance, or restraint, is caused by the segment<br>
rotating into a direction in which its length is greater than the distance between the spigot 10<br>
and the bell 12. The balance between the axial load and the radial load imparted to the bell and<br>
spigot affects the performance of the invention and may be influenced by the configuration of<br>
segment 1. As the forces trying to separate bell 12 and spigot 10 increase so does the axial<br>
resistance imparted to bell 12 and spigot 10 by segment 1. The radial load also imparted keeps<br>
teeth 6 and protrusion 17 of segment 1 engaged with spigot 10 and bell 12 respectively. If the<br>
radial component is too low, then the segment 1 will disengage spigot 10 or bell 12. If the radial<br>
component is too high, then excessive deformation or penetration of spigot 10 by segment 1 may<br>
occur.<br>
The inventors note that this feature, like others shown in the embodiments, may exhibit<br>
particular advantages, but that the presence or absence of these features and advantages is not<br>
strictly required for an embodiment to be considered within the scope of the invention. The<br>
inventors do not consider these advantages, configurations, or possibilities to be limitations on<br>
the invention.<br>
Manufacturing tolerances for spigots and bells are not precise; accordingly, in some<br>
installations, the distance between spigot 10 and bell 12, including features of bell 12 such as<br>
recess seat 43, will be greater or less than such distance in other installations. Under the above<br>
described embodiment of segment 1, where the gap between spigot 10 and recess seat 43 is as<br>
intended or smaller, upon securement of gland 11 at least on of teeth 6 of segment 1 is driven<br>
into spigot 10 and an upper protrusion 17 is driven into bell 12. The inventor believes that due<br>
to the supportive pressures of the gasket material, segment 1 does not begin biting engagement<br>
with spigot 10 until a generally effective seal among bell 12,spigot 10 and gasket 2 has been<br>
effected by compression. Accordingly, teeth 6 are unable<br><br>
to prematurely engage spigot 10 in a manner that may adversely affect the ability to obtain<br>
optimal compression of gasket 2. This delayed engagement can be manipulated by the<br>
means discussed above; namely, the configuration of the gasket, notably the gutter 63,<br>
compression seat surface 9, distortion control surface 62, elastomeric characteristics of the<br>
gasket 2, shape of segment 1, position of segment 1 in gasket 2 or various combinations of<br>
these features. Due to contact with bell 12 in addition to gland 11, separative forces are<br>
transferred by segment 1, not just against gland 11 but also against bell 12. This is<br>
significant in that it reduces a potentially substantial force that is resisted by bolts 45 and<br>
gland 11. Under high loads, bolts 44 and gland 11 may distort, reducing sealing<br>
effectiveness of gasket 2; the current invention's ability to transfer a significant portion of<br>
the magnitude of the separative vector directly to bell 12 via segment 1 therefore enhances<br>
the effectiveness of sealing.<br>
In contrast to situations as in the previous paragraph, in which the distance<br>
between spigot 10 and gasket recess seat 43 is relatively small, an exaggerated pivoting<br>
mechanism is believed to occur in segment 1 when the gap is larger, as follows:<br>
The condition that exists in a large gap situation (e.g. when the manufacturing<br>
tolerances and assembly conditions exist such that bell 12 dimensions are at a maximum<br>
diameter condition and spigot 10 dimensions are at a minimum diameter condition) is such<br>
that upon initial assembly, neither gasket 2 or segment 1 may be in contact with either one or<br>
both spigot 10 or bell 12. During the transition phase gasket deformation will occur, as<br>
previously described, due to compressive forces acting on gasket 2 by spigot 10, gland 11<br>
and bell 12 forcing gasket 2 into contact with both spigot 10 and bell 12. At this point<br>
however, segment 1 may still not be in contact with either spigot 10 or bell 12. Approaching<br>
the end of the transitional phase of assembly, as gutter 63 of gasket 2 closes up due to elastic<br>
deformation of gasket 2 caused by compression of gasket 2, a dramatic rotation of segment 1<br>
will occur due to the previously described shift in the center of pressure of the compressed<br>
gasket and its relationship to segment 1. This dramatic rotation allows segment 1 to bridge<br>
large gaps for which restraint would otherwise be impossible to provide. The final phase of<br>
assembly then proceeds as previously described with teeth 6 embedding in spigot 10 and<br>
protrusion 17 embedding in bell 12.<br>
In an embodiment of segment 1, upper protrusion 17 may be formed in an<br>
angular configuration. Such an angular configuration will cause such points to bite into<br><br>
bell 12 when sufficient pressure is exerted between segment 1 and bell 12. Although such<br>
biting can occur in any event under appropriately high pressures, particularly in the small-<br>
gap situation addressed above, the propensity to bite can be controlled by adjusting the<br>
acuteness of the angle. The inventor notes that the more acute the angle at either given<br>
point, the earlier along a pressure curve the point will likely bite into bell 12. Accordingly, it<br>
is possible to adjust the tendency toward desired points of final rotation of segment 1 by<br>
adjusting the acuteness of angle of the upper protrusion 17, which will in turn adjust the<br>
maximum probable radially outward movement of upper protrusion 17. It should be noted<br>
that at pressures sufficient to drive upper protrusion 17 into bell 12, rotation of segment 1<br>
will be substantially prevented and will occur under conditions of plastic deformation of<br>
either segment 1, spigot 10 or bell 12. This mechanism can be employed to balance the<br>
rotation of segment 1 and control the point of engagement.<br>
Similarly, if upper protrusion 17 is configured in a radiused fashion,<br>
movement of segment 1 may be adjusted to allow axial movement of segment 1 until upper<br>
protrusion 17 obtains non-compressible abutment with bell 12, at which point the axial and<br>
radial forces acting on segment 1 at upper protrusion 17 cause the pivot point to occur in its<br>
near vicinity. Variations of this allow further control of segment engagement and the balance<br>
of axial and radial loading distributed to all load carrying components of the invention.<br>
An alternative embodiment, as shown in Figure 7, may be to incorporate an<br>
elbow 3 into the back face of segment 1. Elbow 3 will contact gland 11 during securement<br>
of the restraining devices 44 in the initial stages of the transitional assembly phase. The<br>
location and configuration of elbow 3 may be tailored to further alter the behavior of<br>
segment 1 during rotation, engagement and lockup. The location and configuration of elbow<br>
3 may be further explained by addressing several characteristics of elbow 3 which may be<br>
modified to alter segment behavior. If elbow 3 is given a sharp radius, elbow 3 may be<br>
made to penetrate gland 11 at the contact point. This penetration will impart additional<br>
resistance to further rotation of segment 1 when the final assembly phase is complete thus<br>
relieving some of the reliance on the angle of the line of action segment 1 makes relative to<br>
spigot 10 and bell 12 when balancing the segments axial and radial load carrying<br>
distribution. Additionally, elbow 3 may be positioned radially outward or inward on<br>
segment 1. Placing elbow 3 radially outward on the segment will increase the rotational<br>
tendency of the segment during the transitional phase of assembly promoting earlier<br><br>
engaement and lockup of segment 1. Placing elbow 3 radially inward on segment 1 will<br>
have a correspondingly opposite effect.<br>
If elbow 3 is made such that it penetrates gland 11 while at the same time<br>
upper protrusion 17 penetrates into bell 12, a situation may be created whereas both axial<br>
and radial loads transferred into bell 12 may be balanced along multiple load paths.<br>
Building upon the concept of altering the acuteness of elbow 3 and upper<br>
protrusion 17, the transition between such points may be less pronounced than in Figure 2.<br>
In fact, the transition may be so smooth as to create a general curve that acts as both elbow 3<br>
and upper protrusion 17. A curve could be adapted to effect biting engagement, whether by<br>
altering the radius of curvature, or by including nubs or other points to operate as<br>
engagement points (which, for purposes of this invention could be considered to be elbow 3<br>
or upper protrusion 17).<br>
Further alternative embodiments that may be included with the foregoing or<br>
otherwise substituted for gutter 63 or the area around gutter 63 include the strategic<br>
positioning of a secondary or tertiary elastomeric material having different deformation<br>
characteristics than the remainder of gasket 2. Such strategic positioning may optimally<br>
include placement between frontal slope 15 of segment 1 in the vicinity of upper protrusion<br>
17. This placement would influence the potential of upper protrusion 17 to move toward<br>
annular recess seat 43, thereby causing upper protrusion 17 to cease substantial rotation prior<br>
to biting into bell 12. Similarly, such secondary or tertiary rubber may be placed radially<br>
outwardly of elbow 3 to influence the maximum ability of elbow 3 to move radially<br>
outwardly of spigot 10.<br>
Although much of the foregoing is discussed in terms of initial installation of<br>
a mechanical joint, the inventor notes the value and applicability of use of the present<br>
invention to "retrofit" or repair existing mechanical joints. By simply rejoinably severing<br>
the ring of gasket 2 (preferably at an angle to the radius) the gasket 2 can be fit over an<br>
existing spigot, and moved into place after removal of the old gasket. The gland 11 can then<br>
be re-attached, completing retrofitting of a standard mechanical joint to a gasket-restrained<br>
mechanical joint.<br><br>
The foregoing represents certain exemplary embodiments of the invention<br>

that they may use their standard skill in the art to make these embodiments or other and<br>
variable embodiments of the claimed invention, based on industry skill, while remaining<br>

disclosure. The inventor stresses that the invention has numerous particular embodiments,<br>
the scope of which shall not be restricted further than the claims as issued. Unless otherwise<br>
specifically stated, applicant does not by consistent use of any term in the detailed<br>
description in connection with an illustrative embodiment intend to limit the meaning of that<br>

superior to rubber-to-pipe friction. In more particular discussion of the<br>
embodiments taught, the invention includes forming the gasket 2 to fit within the<br>
bell 12 in such a manner that a void, or gutter 63 exists during rest, into which<br>
void the gasket compresses, which in turn influences the rotational motion of the<br>
segment 1. In this manner, the configuration of the gasket 2 influences the<br>
timing and extent of rotation throughout the process of securing the glad 11 to<br>
the bell 12.</td>
