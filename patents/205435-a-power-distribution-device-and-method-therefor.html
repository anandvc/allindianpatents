THE PATENTS ACT 1970<br>
[39 OF 1970]<br>
&amp;<br>
THE PATENTS RULES, 2003<br>
COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10; rule 13] <br>
"ELONGATED STAMPING DEVICE"<br>
COLOP STEMPELERZEUGUNG SKOPEK GMBH 8B CO. KG, an Austrian company of Dr. F. Arming-Strasse 5, A-4600 Wels, Austria,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br>
The invention relates to an elongate stamping device, pref¬erably in the form of a pen, comprising an ink pad support for an ink pad, the ink pad support being pivotably mounted on a handle, and a stamping plate for a printing block, the stamping plate be¬ing pivotably mounted on a holding arm, wherein, when in use, the stamping plate, in the inking position, rests on the ink pad with the printing block.<br>
Pen-type stamping devices have already been known which pos¬sibly are even integrated into a writing tool, and which are com¬pact and comfortable to take along. These stamping devices, however, have a very narrow stamping area, since the latter is restricted by the circular diameter of the pen-shaped stamping device, and thus it is not possible to accommodate a standard private stamp having a width of adequate size so as to accommo¬date the information required (e.g. name and address), since the diameter of the pen then would lie in a range in which the stamp¬ing device would not be handy anymore.<br>
From CA 2 028 611 A, such a writing tool is known in which a pen-shaped stamping device can be screwed into the cap. The stamping device substantially consists of a holding means on which both a carrier for the ink pad as well as the stamping plate are pivotably mounted - on a holding arm. In the pivoted-in inking or resting position, ink pad and stamping plate will rest on each other resulting in the pen shape of the stamping device. Yet also there the width of the stamping plate is restricted to the diameter of the pen, resulting in a very restricted possibil-ity of housing the stamp characters.<br>
It is now an object of the invention to provide an  elongate stamping device of the initially defined type, which has a com¬paratively large width of the stamping plate and thus allows for a larger stamping area, where in a plurality of different stamping characters can be used, while still providing the user with a stamping device that is easy to use and which will rest well in the user's hand.<br>
The inventive stamping device of the initially defined type is characterised in that the width of the stamping plate or of the ink pad support, respectively, is larger than the entire thickness of the holding arm, the stamping plate with the print-<br><br>
ing block and the ink pad support for the ink pad in the inking position. This results in an elongate stamping device which dif¬fers from the previously known stamping devices of generally cir¬cular cross-section and which has a substantially flat cross-sectional shape, enabling, on the one hand, a handy configuration capable of being inserted like a pen, and, on the other hand, a stamping area of larger width, whereby substantially more symbols or stamping characters can be housed, e.g. so as to provide a standard private stamp, when in use, the stamping plate and the ink pad are transferred from the closed inking position into an open stamping position in which the stamping plate is provided substantially perpendicularly to the longitudinal axis of the stamping device.<br>
To prevent the stamping device from soiling something with its ink during transportation thereof and to maintain the stamp¬ing device in the inking position it is advantageous if in the inking position, a removable slip-on sleeve is provided which surrounds the holding arm, the stamping plate and the ink pad support and whose open end follows upon the handle.<br>
For great ease of handling and for an optically pleasing shape, it is suitable if the cross-section of the sleeve is oval.<br>
Likewise, it may be advantageous, e.g. for suitable stack¬ing, if the cross-section of the sleeve is rectangular.<br>
The surface of the sleeve is particularly well suited for advertisement prints, if the cross-section of the sleeve has two parallel partial regions which are interconnected via two curved partial regions.<br>
For a high operating comfort despite a simple design, where the user has to do as little as possible by himself, it is advan¬tageous if the stamping plate is mounted eccentrically on the holding arm so as to automatically pivot outwards into the stamp¬ing position on account of gravity when the sleeve is taken off.<br>
For a comfortable handling it is also suitable if the bear¬ing of the stamping plate on the holding arm is provided with a spring so as to automatically pivot outward into the stamping po¬sition when the sleeve is taken off.<br>
For the stamping plate to be stopped in the stamping posi¬tion when it pivots outwards, it is also advantageous if a stop for the stamping plate in its outward-pivoted position is pro¬vided on one side of the holding arm.<br><br>
In order to enable the use of different stamping plates with different printing blocks in the stamping device it is suitable if the stamping plate is releasably connected with the holding arm, e.g. by a snap connection.<br>
To attain the press-on pressure of the ink pad on the print¬ing block required for inking it is suitable if the printing block has a thickness of between 1.7 and 2.3 mm.<br>
To prevent the ink pad support from impeding the stamping procedure, it is advantageous if the plane defined by the ink pad support in the inking position encloses an obtuse angle with the longitudinal axis of the stamping device.<br>
To render the transition from the closed inking position to the open stamping position as automatic as possible for the user, it is advantageous if the bearing of the ink pad support is pro¬vided with a spring so as to automatically pivot outwards into the stamping position when the sleeve is taken off.<br>
Particularly with a view to the comparatively wide shape of the stamping device, it is suitable if the spring is a leg spring which is mounted on the pivot axis of the ink pad support.<br>
To compensate for different heights of different printing blocks and to thus ensure a uniform support of the printing block on the ink pad in the inking position, it is suitable if an ink pad support arm of the ink pad support has a long hole for re¬ceiving a bearing pin, the longitudinal axis of the long hole ex¬tending substantially perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the stamping device.<br>
For a stamping area in which a plurality of different mo¬tives can be printed it is suitable if the printing block has a printing surface the width of which is larger than 1/3 of its length.<br>
For using private stamps with standard dimensions it is ad¬vantageous if the printing block has a printing surface the width of which is larger than 9 mm and the length of which is larger than 35 mm, and which preferably has a width of 14 mm and a length of 38 mm.<br>
To obtain a high number of prints without refilling the ink reservoir with ink, it is suitable if the height of the ink pad is larger than 2 mm, preferably is equal to 3 mm.<br>
Despite the comparatively thick ink pad, the ink from the ink reservoir will be used up after several printing procedures,<br><br>
XI-XI of Fig. 9; and<br>
Fig. 12 shows a schematic cross-section of the stamping de¬vice with an ink pad support slipped onto a rail.<br>
Fig. 1 shows a perspective view of a stamping device 1 com¬prising a sleeve 2. At 3', the handle 3 of the stamping device 1 abuts on the open, front-side end of sleeve 2. Sleeve 2 comprises a clip 4 which assists in putting the stamping device 1 in breast pockets, e.g..<br>
In Fig. la, different cross-sectional shapes of the slip-on sleeve are schematically shown, the slip-on sleeve 2 having an elliptical cross-section. Further preferred embodiments have a rectangular cross-section 2' or a long-hole-shaped cross-section 2', which is comprised of two parallel edges and two segments of a circle. All the cross-sectional shapes 2, 2' and 2'   share the feature that width B is larger than thickness D, and thus a large stamping area is achieved with great ease of handling.<br>
Fig. 2 shows a perspective view of the stamping device 1 in a closed inking position, with sleeve 2 having been omitted. Han¬dle 3 is followed by a holding arm 5 on which a stamping plate 6 is mounted so as to be pivotable about an axle 8 that extends transversely to the longitudinal direction of the stamping device 1.  To realize the pivotable mounting, a gripping part 7 (with snapping projections) of the stamping plate 6 comprises the axle 8 of the holding arm 5, which axle is provided in a recess 9 of the holding arm 5. This results in an easily pivotable and well releasable mounting which allows for a simple exchange or inser¬tion of different stamping plates 6. The printing block 6' glued to the stamping plate 6 has an area contact on an ink pad 10 which is glued into an ink pad support 11. For a positive-fit and frictional engagement between sleeve 2 and handle 3, handle 3 is provided with a bead 12 which, in the closed state, will snap into a corresponding groove (not illustrated) on the inner side of sleeve 2.<br>
Fig. 3 shows a side-view of the stamping device 1 with the ink pad 10 and the stamping plate 6 in the closed inking posi¬tion, in which the printing block 6' glued to the stamping plate 6 rests on the ink pad 10 with its entire surface. The ink pad 10 is glued to the ink pad support 11 which has reinforcing ribs 13, e.g. in cross-shaped arrangement (cf. Fig. 4) on its rear side 11'. Via a forked carrying arm 14, the ink pad support 11 is con-<br><br>
nected to the handle 3 so as to be pivotable about a bearing pin 15. Moreover, a long hole 15' is entered in broken lines in car¬rying arm 14, whereby the ink pad support 11 in the inking posi¬tion has a slight play perpendicularly to the longitudinal direction of the stamping device 1 and thus different thicknesses of the printing block 6' are possible.<br>
In Fig. 4, the hinging of the ink pad support 11 to the han¬dle 3 via the forked ink pad support arm 14 can be seen in top view. Moreover, a spring 16 can be seen between the two fork arms of the ink pad support arm 14, which causes automatic outward pivoting of the ink pad support 11 when the sleeve 2 is taken off. In the view of Fig. 4, the broad side of the stamping device 1 is shown with an elliptical cross-section, wherein the width b of the ink pad support 11 may be larger than in a stamping device having a circular cross-section.<br>
Fig. 5 shows a view of the stamping device 1 onto the 'rear side 6' of the stamping plate 6. In this instance, the releas-able bearing of the stamping plate 6 by aid of the gripping part 7 on axle 8 of the holding arm 5 can be seen. For as compact a construction as possible, the holding arm 5 has an opening 9 which allows the gripping part 7 to engage on axle 8. Also in Fig. 5, the broad side of the stamping device 1 is shown, whereby the width b' of the stamping plate 6 is particularly clearly visible, which is larger as compared to circular, pen-shaped stamping device.<br>
As is moreover visible from Fig. 7, the front-side end of the holding arm 5, which is rounded on one side at 5', so as to allow for the pivoting of the stamping plate 6, forms a stop 5' with the one rim so as to delimit the pivoting movement of the stamping plate 6.<br>
In Fig. 6, a schematic cross-section of the stamping device 1 is shown in the closed inking position with the sleeve 2 slipped thereover, wherein it is visible that the printing block 6' contacts the ink pad 10, resulting in an inking of the stamp characters. The ink pad support 11 has a hemiellipsoidal cross-section, whereby the sleeve 2, once it has been slipped on, can exert a pressure on the ink pad support 11 so as to press it against the stamping plate 6. Moreover, it is visible that the sleeve 2 completely encloses the ink pad support 11 with the ink pad 10 and the holding arm 5 with the stamping plate 6.<br><br>
In Fig. 7, the stamping device 1 is shown in the open stamp¬ing position. After removing the sleeve 2 from the handle 3, the stamping plate 6 mounted on the holding arm 5 pivots into a hori¬zontal position, cf. the arrow in Fig. 7, which is attained by an eccentrical arrangement of the gripping part 7 on the stamping plate 6, whereby the stamping plate 6, when holding the stamping device in the position illustrated in Fig. 7, simply pivots down¬wards on account of gravity until it arrests on stop 5', as il¬lustrated. In this horizontal position, the printing block 6' may simply be pressed onto a substrate on account of its substan¬tially perpendicular position relative to the holding arm 5. Since it is spring-loaded, the ink pad support 11 will pivot up¬wardly about the axis of rotation 15 so as not to impede the stamping procedure. This automatic outward pivoting of the ink pad support is attained by means of the spring 16 shown in Fig. 4.<br>
The stamping device 1 may be returned into the closed inking position in a simple manner, by pressing with one finger each against the rear side 6' of the stamping plate 6 and against the rear side 11' of the ink pad support 11, whereby these two parts 6, 11 are returned into their parallel, mutually abutting inking position. To fix it in the inking position, the sleeve 2 is slipped on until it snaps in over the bead 12 on handle 3.<br>
In Fig. 8, an ink pad support 11 comprising an exchangeable rail 14' is shown on which the forked carrying arm 14 of the ink pad support 11 is attached in one piece, in doing so, also the rectangular depression 10' for accommodating an ink pad 10 (cf. also Fig. 6) is visible. Moreover, a slit-shaped recess 17' can be seen in the body of the ink pad support 11 in the vicinity of the forked carrying arm 14, which serves to receive a leg of spring 16 (cf. also Fig. 12) which is designed as a leg spring.<br>
In Figs. 9 and 11, rail 14' which is dovetail-shaped in cross-section can be seen in its inserted position in the ink pad support 11. To facilitate insertion of the rail 14' in the recess 17 in the ink pad support 11, the rail 14' has a slot 18 in its starting region, whereby two resilient tongues 19 are formed which can be pressed together so as to allow for an easier inser¬tion in recess 17. Moreover, rail 14' according to Fig. 9 has beads 19 on its head side which ensure an enhanced frictional en¬gagement of rail 14' in recess 17.<br><br>
in Fig. 10, a rail 14' somewhat modified relative to Fig. 9 is shown in its inserted position in the ink pad support 11, wherein the rail 14' in its head region at the end of the two re¬silient tongues 19 has latching hooks 21 which snap into an en¬larged recess 17' and thus axially secure the rail 14' in the recess 17. To exchange the ink pad support 11, the two tongues 19 must be pressed towards each other so as to move the latching hooks 21 out of the recess 17'.<br>
Fig. 11 shows a schematic perspective sectional representa¬tion according to line XI-XI of Fig. 9. In this instance, the dovetail-shape of rail 14' can be seen which allows for a posi¬tive-fit or frictional connection between the recess 17 in the ink pad support 11 and the rail 14. Moreover, the gap-shaped re¬cess 17' in the vicinity of the carrying arms 14 is visible which provides for a play of the carrying arm 11 when inserting the rail 14'. Also the frame-shaped recess 16 for accommodating the ink pad 10 (cf. Fig. 6) can be seen.<br>
In Fig. 12, a cross-section of the stamping device 1 with outward-pivoted ink pad support 11 is shown. The ink pad support 11 is slipped onto the rail 14', whereby it can simply be ex¬changed in case of a lack of ink. In the sectional representa¬tion, also the leg spring 16 can be seen which is provided between the two fork arms of the carrying arm 14. By abutment of the one spring leg 16', which engages in the slit-shaped recess 17' (cf. Fig. 11), the leg spring 16 is wound up on the ink pad support 11, and by abutment of the other spring leg 16' on han¬dle 3 when the ink pad support 11 is pivoted into the inking po¬sition. Due to the relatively broad cross-sectional shape of the stamping device 1, the leg spring 16 can be housed between the two fork arms of the carrying arm 14 without any problems, whereas in case of thin stamping devices of round cross-section, a separate axle must be provided to accommodate the leg spring because of the narrow space available.<br>
Moreover, in Fig. 12 the long hole 15' in the carrying arm 15 is visible, which serves to compensate for different printing block thicknesses in the inking position (cf. also Fig. 3).<br><br>
