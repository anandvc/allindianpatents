RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
This application claims priority from United States provisional patent application No.<br>
60/346,613 filed January 10, 2002.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to enhanced absorption fast-dispersing oral dosage<br>
pharmaceutical preparations comprising at least one sedative non-benzodtazepine agent.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Insomnia is defined as difficulty falling asleep, or maintaining sleep, which interferes<br>
with a patient's daytime functioning. Insomnia is the most common sleep complaint with a<br>
prevalence of 26% to 50% in adult populations (Erman ME, Insomnia. Rakel: Conn's Current<br>
Therapy. (Ed.) 52nd ed. Saunders Co. 2000; Shader Rl. Sedative-Hypnotics. Tasman:<br>
Psychiatry, 1st ed. Saunders Co. 1997). Although widely prevalent in the general population, it<br>
is estimated that only 5% to 20% of patients suffering from insomnia seek help from their<br>
clinicians (Erman ME, Insomnia. Rakel: Conn's Current Therapy. 52nd ed. Saunders Co.<br>
2000). It has been reported that in the United States, 10% to 16% of adults suffer from serious<br>
short-term to sub-acute insomnia (i.e., 
serious chronic insomnia (i.e., &gt; 6 months in duration) (Insomnia. Goetz:Textbook of Clinical<br>
Neurology. 1st ed. Saunders Co. 1999).<br>
Benzodiazepines have been the mainstay of therapy for insomnia and are available<br>
as short, intermediate or long-acting hypnotic agents. When used for a short period of time,<br>
the benzodiazepines have been useful in treating insomnia. However, the benzodiazepines<br>
pose potential problems such as altering sleep architecture, rebound insomnia when<br>
discontinued, possible hangover effects and abuse potential, as well as development of<br>
tolerance to the drug. Benzodiazepines act non-selectively on benzodiazepine! (omega!) and<br>
benzodiazepine2 (omega2) receptors, which may explain their interference with memory,<br>
cognition and psychomotor function.<br>
The development of selective benzodiazepine! receptor agonists has produced two<br>
currently available compounds, Zolpidem (Ambien®, Searle and Co.) and Zaleplon (Sonata®,<br>
Wyeth-Ayerst Co.). Zolpidem and Zaleplon are sedative non-benzodiazepine agents that act<br>
selectively on benzodiazepine (BZi) receptors. By virtue of their short half-life, it is thought that<br>
these agents should prevent patients from experiencing benzodiazepine2 receptor effects<br>
involving memory, cognition and psychomotor function. In the literature, neither Zolpidem nor<br>
Zaleplon is reported to affect sleep architecture, as do the benzodiazepines.<br><br><br>
Zolpidem is an imidazopyridine that binds selectively and potently to the BZi<br>
receptor. It does not produce muscle-relaxant or anticonvulsant effects at doses employed for<br>
sleep. It has been demonstrated to reduce sleep latency, increase sleep duration, and reduce<br>
nighttime awakenings. Zolpidem's half-life is approximately 2.5 hours. Metabolism decreases<br>
with age, resulting in the use of doses 50% lower in the elderly. Zolpidem has the advantage<br>
that it preserves stage III and IV sleep and has less disruption of REM (Rapid Eye Movement)<br>
sleep. Zolpidem is poorly soluble in aqueous media.<br>
There is a known food effect on the pharmacokinetics of Zolpidem tartrate. A food-<br>
effect study in 30 healthy male volunteers compared the pharmacokinetics of Zolpidem tartrate<br>
10mg when administered while fasting or 20 minutes after a meal. Results demonstrated that<br>
with food, mean AUC and Cmax were decreased by 15% and 25% respectively, while mean<br>
Tmax was prolonged by 60% (from 1.4 to 2.2 hours). The half-life remained unchanged. These<br>
results suggest that, for faster sleep onset, Zolpidem tartrate should be administered with or<br>
immediately after a meal {PDR, 54 Edition, 20005).<br>
In one study of eight elderly subjects (&gt;70 years), the means for C^x. "^2. and AUC<br>
significantly increased by 50% (255 vs. 284 ng/ml), 32% (2.2 vs. 2.9 hours), and 64% (955 vs.<br>
1,562 ng/hr/ml), respectively, as compared to younger adults (20 to 40 years) following a<br>
single 20 mg oral Zolpidem dose. Zolpidem tartrate did not accumulate in elderly subjects<br>
following nightly oral dosing or 10mg for 1 week (PDR, 1999).<br>
Zaleplon is a pyrazolopyrimidine derivative that is selective for the BZ-i receptor but<br>
is more weakly bound to the receptor than is Zolpidem. Onset of effect is reported to be<br>
slightly more rapid than that for Zolpidem. The half-life is about one hour and is not affected by<br>
aging. Zaleplon is not recommended for sleep maintenance. Zaleplon is poorly soluble in<br>
aqueous media.<br>
Thus, the difference between Zolpidem and Zaleplon, currently marketed as<br>
Ambien® and Sonata® respectively, is that while Sonata® brings on sleep more rapidly than<br>
Ambien®, Sonata® acts for a shorter period of time. Ambien®, on the other hand, is more<br>
useful for people who have trouble staying asleep all night. Accordingly, it seems that it would<br>
be advantageous, given that Zolpidem has far fewer to no nighttime awakening episodes<br>
compared to Zaleplon, to develop a dosage form of Zolpidem, whereby the Zolpidem is<br>
absorbed into the blood stream faster than that currently possible with Ambien®. Such a<br>
dosage form of Zolpidem would bring on sleep much more rapidly than Ambien®, but act just<br>
as long as Ambien® and reduce or eliminate the number of nighttime awakenings currently<br>
seen with Sonata®.<br>
Oral administration of drugs is the most popular route due to ease of ingestion, pain<br>
avoidance, versatility (to accommodate various types of drug candidates), and most<br><br><br>
importantly, patient compliance. Also, solid oral delivery systems do not require sterile<br>
conditions and are, therefore, less expensive to manufacture. Several novel technologies for<br>
oral delivery have recently become available to address the physicochemical and<br>
pharmacokinetic characteristics of drugs, while improving patient compliance.<br>
The novel technology of oral fast-dispersing dosage forms is known as fast<br>
dissolve, rapid dissolve, rapid melt and quick disintegrating tablets. However, the function and<br>
concept of all these dosage forms are similar. By definition, a solid dosage form that dissolves<br>
or disintegrates quickly in the oral cavity, resulting in solution or suspension without the need<br>
for the administration of water is known as oral fast-dispersing dosage form: Several methods<br>
are available for the preparation of oral fast-dispersing dosage forms. These include, modified<br>
tableting systems, floss, or Shearform™ formation by application of centrifugal force and<br>
controlled temperature, and freeze-drying. The inclusion of saccharides seems to be the basis<br>
for most of these technologies. The choice of material(s) depends on their rapid dissolution in<br>
water, sweet taste, low viscosity to provide 'smooth melt feeling', and compressibility.<br>
Current manufactures of oral fast-dispersing dosage forms include, in addition to<br>
the assignee of the subject application, Cima Labs, Prographarm/Ethypharm, R.P. Scherer,<br>
and Yamanouchi-Shaklee. All of these manufacturers market different types of rapidly<br>
dissolving solid oral dosage forms.<br>
Cima Labs markets ORASOLV™, which is an effervescent direct compression<br>
tablet purportedly having an oral dissolution time of 5 to 30 seconds, and QURASOLV™, which<br>
is a direct compression tablet having a taste-masked active agent and a purported oral<br>
dissolution time of 15 to 45 seconds. Cima's U.S. patent No. 5,607,697 describes a solid<br>
dosage form consisting of coated microparticles that disintegrate in the mouth. ORASOLV® is<br>
a direct compression technology, which utilizes effervescence material and taste-masked<br>
active ingredients, and requires only conventional manufacturing equipment. The inclusion of<br>
effervescence causes the dosage form to quickly disintegrate following contact with water or<br>
saliva. By definition, the effervescence material is a chemical reaction between an organic<br>
acid (citric acid, fumaric acid or maleic acid) and a base (sodium bicarbonate, potassium<br>
bicarbonate or magnesium bicarbonate), thereby resulting in the generation of carbon dioxide.<br>
The concept of effervescence is a well-known formulation art utilized in several dosage forms.<br>
However, Cima's technology uses this concept in a modified fashion to achieve fast-<br>
disintegrating dosage forms.<br>
The microparticles are prepared by a novel technique involving the dispersion of the<br>
active ingredient into a suitable polymer dispersion together with other excipients such as<br>
mannitol and magnesium oxide. The microparticle core has a pharmaceutical agent and one<br>
or more sweet-tasting compounds having a negative heat of solution selected from mannitol,<br><br>
sorbitol, a mixture of an artificial sweetener and menthol, a mixture of sugar and menthol, and<br>
methyl salicylate. The microparticle is coated, at least partially, with material that retards<br>
dissolution in the mouth and masks the taste of the pharmaceutical agent. The microparticles<br>
are compressed to form a tablet. Other excipients can also be added to the tablet formation.<br>
WO 98/46215, assigned to Cima Labs, is directed to a hard, compressed, fast melt formulation<br>
having an active ingredient and a matrix of at least a non-direct compression filler and<br>
lubricant. A non-direct compression filler is typically not free flowing, in contrast to a direct<br>
compression (DC grade) filler, and usually requires additional processing to form free-flowing<br>
granules. Cima Labs also has U.S. patents directed to effervescent dosage forms (U.S. Pat.<br>
Nos. 5,503,846, 5,223,264, and 5,178,878) and tableting aids for rapidly dissolving dosage<br>
forms (U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,401,513 and 5,219,574), and an international patent application<br>
directed to rapidly dissolving dosage forms for water-soluble drugs (WO 98/14179).<br>
Ethypharm markets FLASHTAB®, a fast melt tablet having a disintegrating agent<br>
such as carboxymethy! cellulose, a swelling agent such as modified starch, and a taste-<br>
masked active agent. The tablets have a purported oral disintegrating time of less than one<br>
minute (U.S. Pat. No. 5,464,632).<br>
ZYDIS® is marketed by R. P. Scherer Corp. ZYDIS® is a freeze-dried tablet having<br>
an oral dissolution time of 2 to 5 seconds. LyophHized tablets are costly to manufacture and<br>
difficult to package because of the tablets sensitivity to moisture and temperature. U.S. Pat.<br>
No. 4,642,903 (R. P. Scherer Corp.) refers to a fast melt dosage formulation prepared by<br>
dispersing a gas throughout a solution or suspension to be freeze-dried. U.S. Pat. No.<br>
5,188,825 (R. P. Scherer Corp.) refers to freeze-dried dosage forms prepared by bonding or<br>
complexing a water-soluble active agent to or with an ion exchange resin to form a<br>
substantially water insoluble complex, which is then mixed with an appropriate carrier and<br>
freeze dried. U.S. Pat. No. 5,613,023 (R. P. Scherer Corp.) refers to freeze-dried drug dosage<br>
forms made by adding xanthum gum to a suspension of gelatin and active agent. U.S. Pat.<br>
No. 5,827,541 (R. P. Scherer Corp.) discloses a process for preparing solid pharmaceutical<br>
dosage forms of hydrophobic substances. The process involves freeze-drying a dispersion<br>
containing a hydrophobic active ingredient and a surfactant, in a non-aqueous phase; and a<br>
carrier material, in an aqueous phase.<br>
The WOWTAB®, by Yamanouchi Pharma Technologies, features a tablet of<br>
sufficient hardness to maintain the physical characteristics of the dosage form during<br>
production and distribution, until it comes into contact with moisture, such as saliva in the<br>
mouth. The WOWTAB® is a tablet having a combination of a low motdability and a high<br>
moldability saccharide. U.S. patents covering this technology include U.S. Pat. No. 5,576,014<br>
and U.S. Pat. No. 5,446,464.<br><br>
Other companies owning oral fast-dispersing dosage forms include Janssen<br>
Pharmaceutica (QUICKSOLV®). U.S. patents assigned to Janssen Pharmaceutica describe<br>
rapidly dissolving tablets having two polypeptide (or gelatin) components and a bulking agent,<br>
wherein the two components have a net charge of the same sign, and the first component is<br>
more soluble in aqueous solution than the second component. See U.S. Pat. No. 5,807,576,<br>
5,635,210, 5,595,761, 5,587,180, and 5,776,491.<br>
L.A.B. Pharmaceutical Research owns U.S. patents directed to effervescent-based<br>
rapidly dissolving formulations having an effervescent couple of an effervescent acid and an<br>
effervescent base (U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,807,578 and 5,807,577).<br>
Schering Corporation has technology relating to buccal tablets having an active<br>
agent, an excipient (which can be a surfactant) or at least one of sucrose, lactose, or sorbitol,<br>
and either magnesium stearate or sodium dodecyl sulfate (U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,112,616 and<br>
5,073,374). -<br>
Laboratoire L. Lafon owns technology directed to conventional dosage forms made<br>
by lyophilization of an oil-in-water emulsion in which at least one of the two phases contains a<br>
surfactant (U.S. Pat. No. 4,616,047). For this type of formulation, the active ingredient is<br>
maintained in a frozen suspension state and is tableted without micronization or compression,<br>
as such process could damage the active agent.<br>
Takeda Chemicals Inc., Ltd. owns technology directed to a method of making a fast<br>
dissolving tablet in which an active agent and a moistened, soluble carbohydrate are<br>
compression molded into a tablet, followed by drying of the tablets.<br>
Biovail Corporation markets FLASHDOSE®, a direct compression tablet containing<br>
a processed excipient called SHEARFORM®. SHEARFORM® is a floss type substance of<br>
mixed polysaccharides converted to amorphous fibers. U.S. patents describing this<br>
technology include U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,871,781, 5,869,098, 5,866,163, 5,851,553, 5,622,719,<br>
5,567,439 and 5,587,172.<br>
One way to provide self-binding flowable formulations is to formulate using<br>
SHEARFORM® matrices or flosses. These matrices result when using certain processing<br>
techniques, such as that described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,587,172, which is incorporated herein by<br>
reference. The patent discusses the use of flash heat techniques to produce sucrose-<br>
containing shearform flosses, which are then processed to yield quick-dissolving tablets.<br>
The use of shearform matrices for forming comestible units is described in U.S. Pat.<br>
No. 5,895,664. This document discloses a quick dissolving tablet which is formed by: (1) using<br>
flash-flow technology to provide a shearform matrix; (2) combining the partially re-crystallized<br>
shearform matrix with an additive to form flowable, compactable particulate blends; and (3)<br>
compacting the blends at relatively low pressures to produce dosage forms, such as tablets.<br><br>
Additionally, U.S. Pat. No. 5,851,553 discloses a process an apparatus for making<br>
rapidly dissolving forms by flash-flow processing. The patent describes a shearform matrix<br>
formed by a flash-flow process, the shearform matrix is combined with an additive, and the<br>
matrix is molded to make a unit dosage form.<br>
U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,840,331 and 6,048,541 describe tablet formulations derived from<br>
saccharide-based carriers in which the use of a unique combination of feedstock ingredients<br>
yields self-binding, flowable matrices and tablet compositions. This combination, which uses a<br>
blend of sugar alcohols, i.e., sorbitol and xylitol, is superior to glycerine in providing cohesive<br>
properties and flowability.<br>
Shapeable, preferably tabletable, compositions derived from partially hygroscopic<br>
matrices containing the sugar alcohols are useful in the presence of tableting aids and<br>
crystallization promoters in both high and low-pressure tableting processes. Tablets and other<br>
dosage forms, e.g., lozenges, made therefrom rapidly dissolve when placed in the mouth,<br>
generally in less than 30 seconds.<br>
The production of microparticles containing active agent(s) is described in U.S. Pat.<br>
No. 5,683,720, which is incorporated herein by reference. The patent deals with the use of<br>
LIQUIFLASH® processing to spheronize compositions containing one or more active agents.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 6,165,512, owned by the applicant, provides compositions and<br>
shaped oral dosage forms made therefrom having improved properties. Among those<br>
properties are improved processability before shaping and enhanced dissolution and taste-<br>
masking properties when the dosage forms are used. The compositions of the '512 patent are<br>
based on matrices, or flosses, which comprise at least one sugar alcohol, which matrices are<br>
generally considered "single floss" or "unifloss" systems. These systems are exemplified by<br>
xylitol-containing shearform matrices, or flosses, containing a carrier and two or more sugar<br>
alcohols.<br>
Various ingredients, such as coated microparticles containing active agent(s), are<br>
added, in suitable amounts, to the compositions of the present invention after the matrices are<br>
collected and chopped, but before they are shaped, e.g., by tableting.<br>
Highly useful dosage forms result when microparticles made from compositions<br>
containing active agents, solubilizers and spheronization aids are coated with taste-masking<br>
agents, then combined with flosses and conventional pharmaceutical ingredients. The<br>
resultant tablets enjoy the processing ease associated with the use of glycerine-free flosses<br>
and the taste and release properties associated with coated microparticles.<br>
Given that Zolpidem shows very few to no awakening episodes, it would be<br>
advantageous to achieve a much more rapid onset of sleep than currently available with<br>
Ambien®. One advantageous way of achieving a more rapid onset of sleep with the<br>
administration of Zolpidem would be to develop an enhanced absorption oral fast-dispersing<br><br><br>
dosage form of the drug. The technologies described above are most suitable for water-<br>
soluble active agent(s). Zolpidem, however, is a poorly water-soluble drug. The challenge<br>
therefore remains to develop an enhanced absorption fast-dispersing oral dosage form of<br>
Zolpidem.<br>
DEFINITIONS<br>
The phrase "oral fast-dispersing dosage form" as used herein is interchangeable<br>
with fast dissolve, rapid dissolve, rapid melt, quick disintegrating dosage forms, fast disperse<br>
and orally disintegrating tablets, and the like. All such dosage forms are typically in the form of<br>
tablets and are adapted to dissolve, disperse or disintegrate rapidly in the oral cavity, resulting<br>
in a solution or suspension without the need for the administration of water. Any such dosage<br>
form is consistent with the objects of the invention. It is preferred that the dosage form of the<br>
invention dissolve, disintegrate or disperse in 50 seconds or less, preferably in 30 seconds or<br>
less and most preferably in 20 seconds or less. In the context of the present invention,<br>
dissolution relates to water-soluble ingredients only.<br>
As used herein, "enhanced absorption" means a lower T50 with an equal or higher<br>
CmaX) when compared to the currently marketed sedative non-benzodiazepine agent Zolpidem<br>
product Ambien®, but having an area under the plasma-concentration time curve (AUC) that is<br>
equivalent to Ambien®. Cmax is the observed maximum plasma concentration and can be<br>
measured after a single-dose or steady-state of the sedative non-benzodiazepine agent for<br>
every dose given. Wagner-Nelson deconvolution defines T50 as the time taken for 50% of the<br>
drug to be absorbed into the system. The reference for Wagner-Nelson deconvolution can be<br>
found in: Gibaldi M., Perrier D. Pharmacokinetics. New York: Marcel Dekker, Inc., 1982. The<br>
AUC, or the Area Under the Curve, of the pharmacokinetic profile, signifies the extent of<br>
absorption of a drug.<br>
The sedative non-benzodiazepine agent Zolpidem as used herein includes the<br>
tartrate (also referred to in the art as hemitartrate) of Zolpidem or any other pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salt of Zolpidem consistent with the objects of the invention.<br>
An effective amount of the sedative non-benzodiazepine agent, preferably<br>
Zolpidem, is specifically contemplated. By the term "effective amount," it is understood that "a<br>
pharmaceutically effective amount" is contemplated. A "pharmaceutically effective amount" is<br>
the amount or quantity of the sedative non-benzodiazepine agent, preferably Zolpidem, which<br>
is sufficient to elicit an appreciable biological response when administered to a patient.<br>
The dosage form of the invention is administered in the evening either in the fed or<br>
fasted state. When administered in the fed state, the dosage form of the invention is<br>
administered within 30 minutes of the last meal of the day. When administered in the fasted<br><br><br>
state, the dosage form of the invention is administered at least after 4 hours after the last meal<br>
of the day.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
There is an unmet need for the development of an enhanced absorption fast-<br>
dispersing oral dosage form for the treatment of insomnia. Accordingly, this invention relates<br>
to an enhanced absorption fast-dispersing oral dosage form comprising at least one sedative<br>
non-benzodiazepine agent. The sedative non-benzodiazepine agent is preferably Zolpidem.<br>
In one aspect of the invention, there is provided an enhanced absorption<br>
pharmaceutical composition comprising a plurality of microparticles, each microparticle<br>
comprising at least one sedative non-benzodiazepine agent, at least one spheronization aid<br>
and at least one solubility enhancer.<br>
The sedative non-benzodiazepine agent is about 1% to about 55% by weight of the<br>
microparticle, preferably about 12.5% to about 17.5% by weight of the microparticle and most<br>
preferably about 15% by weight of the microparticle. The spheronization aid is about 5% to<br>
about 85% by weight of the microparticle, preferably about 45% to about 55% by weight of the<br>
microparticle and most preferably about 50% by weight of the microparticle. The solubility<br>
enhancer(s) comprising the microparticles are in the range of from greater than 0% to about<br>
90%, preferably from about 30% to about 40% by weight and most preferably about 35% by<br>
weight of the microparticle. The preferred sedative non-benzodiazepine agent is Zolpidem, the<br>
preferred spheronization aid is distilled monoglycerides, and the preferred solubility enhancer<br>
is a macrogol fatty acid ester with Gelucire 50/13® being the most preferred macrogol fatty acid<br>
ester.<br>
The microparticles of the invention can be incorporated into tablets or capsules as<br>
uncoated microparticles or microparticles coated with at least one taste-masking coat. When<br>
incorporated into tablets, it is preferred that the microparticles be coated with at least one<br>
taste-masking coating.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the tablet incorporating the microparticles of the<br>
invention is an oral fast-dispersing tablet adapted to rapidly dissolve in the mouth of a patient.<br>
In another aspect of the invention there is provided an oral fast-dispersing dosage<br>

shearform matrix consisting essentially of at least one saccharide carrier and at least two<br>
sugar alcohols, comprising sorbitol and about 0.5% to about 25% by weight of xyiitol which<br>
matrix has been treated with at least one crystallization modifier. The crystallization modifier is<br>
preferably Tween 80.<br>
It is preferred that the oral fast dispersing dosage form when administered in the<br>
evening to a patient in need of such administration exhibit a blood absorption profile such that<br>

absorbed, after about 4 hours at least about 75% of the Zolpidem is absorbed, and after about<br>
6 hours more than about 90% of the Zolpidem is absorbed, into the blood stream of the patient<br>
in the fed state.<br>
In the fasting state, however, it is preferred that the oral fast dispersing dosage form<br>
when administered to a patient in need of such administration in the evening exhibit a blood<br>
absorption profile such that after about 0.25 hours at least about 5% of the Zolpidem is<br>
absorbed, after about 0.5 hours at least about 55% of the Zolpidem is absorbed, after about<br>
0.75 hours at least about 75% of the Zolpidem is absorbed, after about 1 hour at least about<br>
80% of the Zolpidem is absorbed, after about 1.5 hours at least about 85% of the Zolpidem is<br>
absorbed, after about 2 hours at least about 90% of the Zolpidem is absorbed, and after about<br>
4 hours at least about 95% of the Zolpidem is absorbed into the blood stream of the patient.<br>
In another aspect of the present invention, the dosage form, provides a Tmax for the<br>
sedative non-benzodiazepine agent Zolpidem ranging from about 0.5 hours to about 6 hours<br>
and a Cmax ranging from about 42 ng/ml to about 141 ng/ml Zolpidem in the blood after<br>
administration of the dosage form to a human in the fed state with a mean Tmax of about 2.8<br>
hours and a mean Cmax of about 82.4 ng/ml Zolpidem in the blood after administration of the<br>
dosage form.<br>
In another aspect of the present invention, the dosage form, when orally<br>
administered in the evening to a fasting patient provides a Tmax for the sedative non-<br>
benzodiazepine agent Zolpidem ranging from about 0.5 hours to about 4 hours and a Cmax<br>
ranging from about 48 ng/ml to about 189 ng/ml Zolpidem in the blood after administration of<br><br>
the dosage form to a human with a mean Tmax of about 1.6 hours and a mean Cmax of about<br>
112.7 ng/ml Zolpidem in the blood after administration of the dosage form to a human.<br>
In another aspect of the present invention, the dosage form, when administered<br>
orally to a fed patient, provides a plasma concentration time curve with an AUC(0-1) ranging<br>
from about 216 ng.hr/ml to about 1352 ng.hr/ml with a mean AUC(0-1) of about 633 ng.hr/ml.<br>
In another aspect of the present invention, the dosage form, when administered<br>
orally to a fed patient, provides a plasma concentration time curve with an AUC(0-mnnity) ranging<br>
from about 220 ng.hr/ml to about 1408 ng.hr/ml with a mean AlC(0-infinity) of about 646 ng.hr/ml.<br>
In another aspect of the present invention, the dosage form, when administered<br>
orally to a fasting patient, provides a plasma concentration time curve with an AUC((M) ranging<br>
from about 167 ng.hr/ml to about 1764 ng.hr/ml with a mean AUC((M) of about 688 ng.hr/ml.<br>
In another aspect of the present invention, the dosage form, when administered<br>
orally to a fasting patient, provides a plasma concentration time curve with an AUC(0-infinity)<br>
ranging from about 170 ng.hr/ml to about 1873 ng.hr/ml with a mean AUC(o-infinity) of about 702<br>
ng.hr/ml.<br>
Accordingly, the advantage of the enhanced absorption fast-dispersing oral dosage<br>
form of the invention is that it provides a shorter C50 % absorption in both the fed and fasted<br>
patient than the currently marketed oral form of Zolpidem (Ambien®), which may translate into<br>
a clinical advantage. Further, the taste-masked microparticles can deliver Zolpidem through<br>
orally dispersible or conventional means.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to an enhanced absorption fast-dispersing oral dosage form<br>
comprising at least one sedative non-benzodiazepine agent. The sedative non-<br>
benzodiazepine agent is preferably Zolpidem. The dosage form comprises (a) microparticles<br>
comprising at least one sedative non-benzodiazepine agent, preferably Zolpidem, at least one<br>
solubility enhancer and at least one spheronization aid and (b) a matrix having enhanced self-<br>
binding characteristics.<br>
I. Microparticles<br>
The microparticles of the invention comprise an effective amount of at least one<br>
sedative non-benzodiazepine agent, at least one spheronization aid and at least one solubility<br>
enhancer. The term -microparticles' as used herein is interchangeable with the terms<br>
"microspheres", "spherical particles" and "microcapsules".<br>
The sedative non-benzodiazepine agents(s) used herein can be selected from the<br>
group of sedative non-benzodiazepine agents, which include, but are not limited to Zolpidem,<br>
zaleplon, zopiicone, trazodone, nefazodone, indiplon, esoplicone, chloral hydrate, chloral<br>
betaine, mirtazapine, clomethiazole, promethazine, CCD-3693, Co-326, IP-100-9, PPRT-211.<br><br><br>
SC-72393, TAK-375, and ethychlorvynol. The invention also contemplates any combination of<br>
the above sedative-hypnotic therapeutic agents and are not limited to the above listed sedative<br>
non-benzodiazepine agents.<br>
Particularly useful sedative non-benzodiazepine agents are those that are sparingly<br>
soluble and whose dissolution and release properties in-vivo are enhanced by the solubilizing<br>
agents used herein. The most preferred sedative non-benzodiazepine agent is Zolpidem. The<br>
amount of sedative non-benzodiazepine agent(s), comprising the microparticles is in the range<br>
of from about 1% to about 55%, preferably from about 12.5% to about 17.5% and most<br>
preferably about 15% by weight of the microparticle.<br>
Spheronization aid(s) used herein are materials, which help the drug-containing mix<br>
to form robust durable spherical particles. Some examples of the preferred materials useful as<br>
spheronization aids include, but are not limited to distilled monoglycerides, glyceryl behenate,<br>
glyceryl palmitostearate, hydrogenated vegetable oils, sodium lauryl sulfate, polyoxyethylene<br>
ethers, cetostearyt alcohol, waxes and wax-like materials. Certain thermo-plastic or thermo-<br>
softening polymers may also function as spheronization aids. Some non-limiting examples of<br>
such thermo-plastic or thermo-softening polymers include Povidone, cellulose ethers and<br>
polyvinylalcohols. Mixtures of spheronization aids can also be used. The most preferred<br>
spheronization aid is distilled monoglycerides, as for example DMG-03VF. The spheronization<br>
aid(s) comprising the microparticles is in the range of from about 5% to about 85%, preferably<br>
from about 45% to about 55% and most preferably about 50% by weight of the microparticle.<br>
Solubility enhancers are surfactants and other materials included in the<br>
microparticles to assist in the dissolution of a drug, particularly of poorly soluble drugs. The<br>
ability of a surfactant to reduce the solid/liquid interfacial tension will permit fluids to wet the<br>
solid more effectively and thus aid the penetration of fluids into the drug-surfactant mass to<br>
increase the dissolution and absorption of the drug. Some examples of the preferred materials<br>
useful as solubility enhancers include macrogol fatty acid esters, polyethylene glycol,<br>
polyethylene glycol derivatives of lipophilic molecules such as polyethylene glycol fatty acid<br>
esters, polyethylene glycol fatty alcohol ethers, polymeric surfactant materials containing one<br>
or more polyoxyalkylene blocks, such as poloxamers, and other<br>
polyoxyethylene/polyoxypropylene copolymers as well as sucrose ethers and esters.<br>
Combinations of solubility enhancers can be used. The preferred solubility enhancers are the<br>
macrogol fatty acid esters Gelucire 50/13® or Gelucire 44/14® with Gelucire 50/13® being the<br>
most preferred. The solubility enhancer(s) comprising the microparticles are in the range of<br>
from greater than 0% to about 90%, preferably from about 30% to about 40% by weight and<br>
most preferably about 35% by weight of the microparticle.<br><br><br>
It is preferred that the microparticles contain only the sedative non-benzodiazepine<br>
agent(s), solubilizer(s) and spheronization aid(s). However, other excipients consistent with<br>
the objects of the invention may also be used.<br>
The microparticles of the invention are manufactured using the applicant's<br>
proprietary CEFORM™ (Centrifugally Extruded &amp; Formed Microspheres) technology, which is<br>
the simultaneous use of flash heat and centrifugal force, using proprietary designed<br>
equipment, to convert dry powder systems into microspheres of uniform size and shape. The<br>
microspheres of the invention are prepared by hot-melt encapsulation described in detail in<br>
U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,587,172, 5,616,344, and 5,622,719, whose contents are wholly incorporated<br>
herein by reference. The process for manufacturing the microparticles of the invention are not<br>
limited to the CEFORM™ technology, and any other technology resulting in the formation of<br>
the microparticles consistent with the objects of the invention may also be used.<br>
The processing of the microparticles is carried out in a continuous fashion, whereby<br>
a pre-blend of drug and excipients is fed into a spinning "microsphere head", also termed as an<br>
"spheronizing head". The microsphere head, which is a multi-aperture production unit, spins<br>
on its axis and is heated by electrical power. The drug and excipient(s) pre-blend is fed into<br>
the center of the head with an automated feeder. The material moves, via centrifugal force, to<br>
the outer rim where the heaters, located in the rim of the head, heat the material.<br>
Microspheres are formed when the molten material exits the head, which are then cooled by<br>
convection as they fall to the bottom of the Microsphere Chamber. The product is then<br>
collected and stored in suitable product containers. Careful selection of the types and levels of<br>
excipient(s) control microparticle properties such as sphericity, surface morphology, and<br>
dissolution rate. The advantage of such a process is that microspheres are produced and<br>
collected from a dry feedstock without the use of any organic solvents.<br>
Two fundamental approaches are used to produce microspheres: (1) the<br>
encapsulation process and (2) the co-melt process. In the encapsulation approach, the<br>
process is conducted below the melting point of the drug. Therefore, the excipients are<br>
designed to melt and entrain the drug particles on passing through the apertures to form<br>
microspheres. The resulting microspheres contain the drug, in its native state, essentially<br>
enveloped by or as an intimate matrix with the resolidified excipients. In the co-melt approach,<br>
the process is conducted above the melting point of the drug. In this case, the drug and the<br>
excipients melt or become fluid simultaneously upon exposure to the heat. The molten mixture<br>
exits the head and forms microspheres, which cool as they fall to the bottom of the collection<br>
bin where they are collected.<br>
The microparticles of the invention comprising the sedative non-benzodiazepine<br>
agent(s) are manufactured using the encapsulation approach, with at least one spheronizing<br>
agent, which also acts as a drug carrier, and at least one solubility enhancer. The<br><br><br>
encapsulation approach is favored because it is believed that the hydrophiiic solubilizer(s)<br>
encapsulates the hydrophobic sedative non-benzodiazepine agent(s), thus aiding the solubility<br>
of the sedative non-benzodiazepine agent. In the encapsulation technique the excipient(s)<br>
which are chosen must a have a lower melting point than the drug with which they will be<br>
combined (158.4-159 reference: Merck Index, 12th edition). Therefore the spheronizing<br>
process can be performed at lower temperatures, than the melting point of the drug. This<br>
eliminates the risk of polymeric interconversion, which can occur when using processing<br>
temperatures close to the melting point. The microspheres can also be prepared using other<br>
techniques such as fluid bed or melt extrusion, however, the CEFORM™ process is the<br>
preferred method of manufacturing.<br>
In an alternative embodiment of the invention, it is preferred that the microparticles<br>
be coated with at least one coating after the spheronization process to mask the taste of any<br>
unpleasant tasting active in the microparticles. Useful coating formulations contain polymeric<br>
ingredients as well as excipient(s) conventionally employed in such coatings.<br>
Useful taste-masking coatings can include (meth)acrylate/cellulosic polymers.<br>
Ethylcellulose (EC), hydroxypropylcelluiose (HPC), hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC).and<br>
polymethacrylate polymers, such as Eudragit RS, Eudragit RL, E 100, and NE30D or mixtures<br>
thereof are useful..<br>
The cellulosic coatings are generally applied to the microparticles after<br>
spheronization from an organic solvent solution(s). Typical solvents include one or more of<br>
acetone, aikyl alcohols (e.g., isopropyl alcohol), and the like. Coating devices used to coat the<br>
microparticles of the invention include those conventionally used in pharmaceutical processing,<br>
with fluidized bed coating devices being preferred. The coatings applied to the microparticles<br>
may contain ingredients other than the cellulosics. Thus, one or more colorants, flavorants,<br>
sweeteners, can also be used in the coating formulations.<br>
Colorants used include food, drug and cosmetic colors (FD&amp;C), drug and cosmetic<br>
colors (D&amp;C) or external drug and cosmetic colors (Ext. D&amp;C). These colors are dyes, lakes,<br>
and certain natural and derived colorants. Useful lakes include dyes absorbed on aluminum<br>
hydroxide or other suitable carriers.<br>
Flavorants may be chosen from natural and synthetic flavoring liquids. An<br>
illustrative list of such agents includes volatile oils, synthetic flavor oils, flavoring aromatics,<br>
oils, liquids, oleoresins and extracts derived from plants, leaves, flowers, fruits, stems and<br>
combinations thereof. A non-limiting representative list of these includes citric oils, such as<br>
lemon, orange, grape, lime and grapefruit, and fruit essences, including apple, pear, peach,<br>
grape, strawberry, raspberry, cherry, plum, pineapple, apricot, or other fruit flavors.<br>
Other useful flavorings include aldehydes and esters, such as benzaldehyde<br>
(cherry, almond); citral, i.e., alpha-citral (lemon, lime); neral, i.e.. beta-citral (lemon, lime);<br><br><br>
decanal (orange, lemon); aldehyde C-8 (citrus fruits); aldehyde C-9 (citrus fruits); aldehyde C-<br>
12 (citrus fruits); tolyl aldehyde (cherry, almond); 2,6-dimethyloctanal (green fruit); 2-dodenal<br>
(citrus mandarin); mixtures thereof and the like.<br>
The sweeteners may be chosen from the following non-limiting list: glucose (corn<br>
syrup), dextrose, invert sugar, fructose, and mixtures thereof (when not used as a carrier);<br>
saccharin and its various salts, such as sodium salt; dipeptide sweeteners such as aspartame;<br>
dihydrochalcone compounds, glycyrrhizin; Steva Rebaudiana (Stevioside); chloro derivatives<br>
or sucrose such as sucralose; and sugar alcohols such as sorbitol, mannitol, xylitol, and the<br>
like. Also contemplated are hydrogenated starch hydrolysates and the synthetic sweeteners<br>
such as S.e-dihydro-e-methyl-l-l-I^.S-oxathiazin-^l^^-dioxide, particularly the potassium<br>
salt (acesulfame-K), and sodium and calcium satts thereof. The sweeteners may be used<br>
alone or in any combination thereof.<br>
The diameter of the uncoated and coated microparticles range from about 150pm in<br>
diameter to about 500pm in diameter, preferably from about 200pm to about 300pm and most<br>
preferably from about 200pm to about 250pm. Coating levels of about 0% to about 100% are<br>
effective, preferably about 15-30% and most preferably about 25%.<br>
II. Dosage Forms<br>
Due to the spherical nature of the coated and uncoated microparticles of the<br>
invention and their robustness, attributed to the high quantity of spheronization aid(s), the<br>
microparticles of the invention can be used in a number of different delivery systems including<br>
FLASHDOSE™ tablets, gelatin capsules, direct compression tablets, buccal tablets and the<br>
like.<br>
It is preferred that the coated taste-masked microparticles of the invention be<br>
incorporated into the FLASHDOSE™ tablet, which is a direct compression tablet containing a<br>
processed excipient called SHEARFORM™. SHEARFORM™ is a floss type substance of<br>
mixed polysaccharides converted to amorphous fibers. The terms "floss" and "matrix" are<br>
used interchangeably herein.<br>
The preparation of flosses suitable for use in the present invention is disclosed in<br>
U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,622,719, 5.851,553, 5,866,163 all for "Process and Apparatus for Making<br>
Rapidly Dissolving Dosage Units and Product Therefrom" and 5,895,664 for "Process for<br>
forming quickly dispersing comestible unit and product therefrom", the contents of which are<br>
incorporated herein by reference. Preferably, the floss is a "shearform matrix" produced by<br>
subjecting a feedstock which contains a sugar carrier to flash-heat processing.<br>
In the flash-heat process, the feedstock is simultaneously subjected to centrifugal<br>
force and to a temperature gradient, which raises the temperature of the mass to create an<br>
internal flow condition, which permits part of it to move with respect to the rest of the mass.<br>
The flowing mass exits through openings provided in the perimeter of a spinning head. The<br><br><br>
temperature gradient is supplied using heaters or other means which cause the mass'<br>
temperature to rise. Centrifugal force in the spinning head flings the internally flowing mass<br>
outwardly, so that it reforms as discrete fibers with changed structures.<br>
An apparatus, which produces suitable conditions, is a modified floss-making<br>
machine, such as that described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,834,033, entitled "Apparatus for Melt<br>
Spinning Feedstock Material having a Flow Restricting Ring". The entire content of that<br>
application is hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
Typically, spinning is conducted at temperatures and speeds of about 180 to 250°C<br>
and 3,000 to 4,000 rpm, respectively.<br>
Suitable spinner heads include that disclosed in U.S. Pat. No.5,458,823, which<br>
contents is hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
Other useful apparatuses or processes that provide similar forces and temperature<br>
gradient conditions can be used.<br>
Floss or matrix particles can be chopped using the apparatus discussed in U.S. Pat.<br>
No.5,637,326 or another device having a similar function.<br>
The matrices used herein include a carrier, or feedstock material, which comprises<br>
at least one material selected from materials which are capable of undergoing the physical<br>
and/or chemical changes associated with flash heat processing. Useful carriers include<br>
carbohydrates, which become free-form particulates when flash heat processed. Saccharide-<br>
based carriers, including saccharides (i.e., sugars), polysaccharides and mixtures thereof can<br>
be used.<br>
The feedstocks used in the invention can include carriers chosen from various<br>
classes of "sugars". "Sugars" are those substances, which are based on simple crystalline<br>
mono- and di-saccharide structures, i.e., based on C5 and C6 sugar structures. They can<br>
include glucose, sucrose, fructose, lactose, maltose, pentose, arabinose, xylose, ribose,<br>
mannose, galactose, sorbose, dextrose and sugar alcohols, such as sorbitol, mannitol, xylitol,<br>
maltitol, isomalt, sucralose and the like and mixtures thereof. Sucrose is the preferred sugar.<br>
Useful mixtures of carriers include the sugars listed above along with additional<br>
mono- di-, tri- and polysaccharides. Additional saccharides can be used in amounts of up to<br>
50% by weight of the total sugar, preferably up to 30%, most preferably up to 20%.<br>
Optionally, the polysaccharides can be used alone as carriers. Polysaccharide<br>
carriers include polydextrose and the like. Polydextrose is a non-sucrose, essentially non-<br>
nutritive, carbohydrate substitute. It can be prepared through polymerization of glucose in the<br>
presence of polycarboxylic acid catalysts and polyols. Generally, polydextrose is commercially<br>
available in three forms: polydextrose A and polydextrose K, which are powdered solids; and<br>
polydextrose N supplied as a 70% solution. The contents of U.S. Pat. No. 5,501,858, which<br>
discusses polydextrose is incorporated herein by reference.<br><br>
If other carrier materials are used, they are employed in combination with sugar and<br>
not as total replacement therefor. For example, maltodextrins may be employed. Maltodextrins<br>
include mixtures of carbohydrates resulting from the hydrolysis of a saccharide. They are<br>
solids having a dextrose equivalent (DE) of up to and including 65.<br>
The carrier can also include malto-oligo-saccharides produced by selective<br>
hydrolysis of cornstarch. A general description of maltooligo-saccharides useful herein is set<br>
forth in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5.347,341 and 5,429,836 both of which are incorporated herein by<br>
reference.<br>
Applicants use the following types of matrix systems, which systems are devoid of<br>
glycerine.<br>
In the first system, xylitol is added to a mixture of saccharide-based carrier and one<br>
or more additional sugar alcohols, with sorbitol being favored as an additional sugar alcohol.<br>
The carrier mix is flash-heat processed to provide shearform floss having self-binding<br>
properties. Flosses made using sucrose, sorbitol and xylitol have been found to yield<br>
particularly effective self-binding properties. They exemplify "single floss" or "unifloss" systems.<br>
The second system makes separate xylitol-containing binder flosses. The binder<br>
flosses ("binder portions") are combined with base flosses ("base portions"), which contain a<br>
different sugar alcohol and a saccharide. Preferably, the base floss contains sorbitol and<br>
sucrose, while the binder floss contains xylitol. These are termed "dual floss" systems.<br>
The ingredients, which increase cohesiveness and give self-binding properties<br>
preferably include sugar alcohols, such as sorbitol, xylitol, maltitol, mannitol and mixtures<br>
thereof, all of which form flosses. Other sugar alcohols, especially hygroscopic ones, are<br>
contemplated.<br>
Xylitol and sorbitol are the preferred sugar alcohols. Effective amounts of xylitol in<br>
the flosses are between about 0.5% and 25%, and preferably about 10% by weight. Sorbitol is<br>
used in the flosses in amounts of about 0.5% to about 40% by weight.<br>
When sorbitol and xylitol are used, the ratio of sorbitol to xylitol is from about 1:0.1<br>
to about 1:10.<br>
In dual floss systems, about 20% to about 80%, preferably about 34%, of the total<br>
floss content is xylitol-containing, or binder, floss. Likewise, the sorbitol containing, or base,<br>
floss may be about 20% to about 80% of the total floss. In some "dual floss" embodiments,<br>
xylitol-containing flosses are first mixed with active ingredient(s), then mixed with<br>
sucrose/sorbitol flosses.<br>
Regardless of the number of flosses, the total floss content preferably includes<br>
about 50% to about 85% sucrose, about 5% to about 20% sorbitol and about 5% to about 25%<br>
xylitol.<br><br>
In some cases, flosses are used along with bio-affecting, or active, microspheres in<br>
the tableting process. Often, xylitol-containing floss is added to microspheres of one or more<br>
active agents first and then non-xylitol-containing floss is added. Typically, the weight ratio of<br>
total floss to microspheres is about 1:1. In these instances, about 5% to about 25% of the floss<br>
is xylitol.<br>
Whereas prior art shearform matrices conventionally included a liquid binding<br>
additive such as glycerine, the present matrices do not. Instead, they get their enhanced<br>
cohesiveness, self-binding character and flowability directly from the matrix or feedstock<br>
ingredients and the processing used.<br>
The amorphous shearform matrix of the present invention is preferably made from a<br>
feedstock, which includes sucrose, sorbitol, and xylitol. As set forth in U.S. Pat. No. 5,869,098,<br>
entitled "Fast Dissolving Comestible Units Formed under High Speed/High Pressure<br>
Conditions", these compositions promote recrystallization and tableting of the matrix-containing<br>
mixes to a level sufficient to provide particulate flowability for use in high speed and high<br>
pressure tableting equipment.<br>
The compositions to be processed into comestible units, or tablets, can contain<br>
conventional additives. Conventional quantities of these additives may be incorporated into<br>
one or more of the matrices or may be mixed therewith prior to tableting. Useful amounts of<br>
conventional additives range from about 0.01% to about 80% by weight, based on the weight<br>
of the matrices or formulations in which they are used. The quantities may vary from these<br>
amounts, depending on the functions of the additives and the characteristics desired in the<br>
matrices and/or the final tablet compositions.<br>
Conventional tableting aids may be selected from a wide variety of materials such<br>
as lubricants, glidants, anti-caking agents and flow agents. For example, lubricants such as<br>
adipic acid, magnesium stearate, calcium stearate, zinc stearate, hydrogenated vegetable oils,<br>
sodium chloride, sterotex, polyoxyethylene, glyceryl monostearate, talc, polyethylene glycol,<br>
sodium benzoate, sodium lauryl sulfate, magnesium lauryl sulfate, sodium stearyl fumarate,<br>
light mineral oil and the like may be employed, with sodium stearyl fumarate preferred. Waxy<br>
fatty acid esters, such as glyceryl behenate, sold as "Compritol™" products, can be used.<br>
Other useful commercial lubricants include "Stear-O-Wet™" and "Myvatex™ TL". Mixtures are<br>
operable. Lubricants are used in amounts ranging from about 0% to about 10%, with about<br>
0.01% to about 5.0% typically used.<br>
Glidants such as starch, talc, lactose, stearates, dibasic calcium phosphate,<br>
magnesium carbonate, magnesium oxide, calcium silicate, Cabosil™, Syloid™, and silicon<br>
dioxide aerogels may be employed. Glidants are present in amounts ranging from about 0% to<br>
about 20%, with amounts of about 0.1% to about 5.0% being typical. Lactose, which may be a<br><br>
glidant or filler, can be added to the chopped floss at about 2% concentration to inhibit<br>
clumping.<br>
The preformed matrices produced in accordance herewith may be rendered more<br>
crystalline by one or more of the following crystallizing techniques. The nature of the matrix<br>
feedstock determines whether the matrix is re-crystallized after it is formed. Nonetheless,<br>
"crystallization" and "recrystallization" are used interchangeably herein.<br>
One technique for recrystallizing involves the use of crystallization enhancers.<br>
These are used after the floss has been formed, but before the floss-containing composition is<br>
tableted. Suitable crystallization enhancers include ethanol, polyvinyl-pyrrolidpne, water (e.g.<br>
moisture), glycerine, radiant energy (e.g., microwaves) and the like, with combinations being<br>
useful. When they are physical materials, typical amounts of these enhancers range from<br>
about 0.01% to about 10.0% by weight of the tablet composition.<br>
Another technique relates to the use of crystallization modifiers. These<br>
crystallization modifiers are floss ingredients, used at levels of about 0.01% to about 20.0% by<br>
weight of the floss.<br>
Surfactants are preferred crystallization modifiers. Other materials, which are non-<br>
saccharide hydrophilic organic materials may also be used. Useful modifiers preferably have a<br>
hydrophilic to lipid balance (HLB) of about 6 or more. Such materials include, without limitation,<br>
anionic, cationic, and zwitterionic surfactants as well as neutral materials with suitable HLB<br>
values. Hydrophilic materials having polyethylene oxide linkages are effective. Those with<br>
molecular weights of at least about 200, preferably at least 400, are highly useful.<br>
Crystallization modifiers useful herein include: lecithin, polyethylene glycol (PEG),<br>
propylene glycol (PPG), dextrose, the SPANS® and TWEENS® which are commercially<br>
available from ICI America, and the surface active agents known as "Carbowax®". Generally,<br>
the polyoxyethylene sorbitan fatty acid esters called TWEEN®s, or combinations of such<br>
modifiers are used. Crystallization modifiers are usually incorporated into matrices in amounts<br>
of between about 0% and 10%.<br>
Optionally, the matrices are allowed to re-crystallize, with or without added<br>
crystallization modifiers, either before or after they are combined with the non-matrix<br>
component(s), e.g., the bio-affecting additive(s). When recrystallization occurs before tableting,<br>
the recrystallization level of the matrix generally reaches at least about 10%. The use of such<br>
partially re-crystallized matrices leads to compositions that are free flowing and tabletable<br>
using conventional machines. U.S. Pat. No. 5,597,416 describes a process for recrystallizing in<br>
the presence of additives.<br>
Methods for effecting the recrystallization of the matrices include: use of Tween 80<br>
or other crystallization modifier(s) in the matrix premix; aging of the matrix for up to several<br><br>
weeks, contacting the matrix with sufficient moisture and heat to induce crystallization, and<br>
treating the floss or the floss-containing composition with ethanol or another crystallization<br>
enhancer. Combinations of these may be used.<br>
When a surfactant, such as a Tween® is used, about 0.001% to about 1.00% is<br>
included in the floss preblend as a crystallization modifier. Following preblending, the<br>
formulations are processed into flosses, then chopped and used, with or without additives, to<br>
make tablets. Mixtures of surfactants can be used.<br>
Aging may be used to re-crystallize the matrix or floss. The aging process involves<br>
a two-step process. First, the matrix, which typically contains at least one crystallization<br>
modifier, is formed, chopped and allowed to stand in closed or sealed containers without<br>
fluidization or other agitation under ambient conditions, e.g., at room temperature and<br>
atmospheric pressure, for up to several days, preferably for about 1 to about 3 days. Later, the<br>
matrix is mixed, and optionally further chopped, with one or more other ingredients. The mix is<br>
then aged by allowing it to stand for an additional period of about 1 to about 3 days. Generally,<br>
the two-step aging process takes a total of about one week, with periods of about 4 to about 5<br>
days being typical.<br>
The flosses may also be re-crystallized by subjecting them to increased heat and<br>
moisture. This process is similar to aging, but involves shorter periods of time. Using a<br>
fluidized bed apparatus or other suitable device, chopped floss is fluidized while heating, at<br>
ambient humidity and pressure, to temperatures of about 25°C. to about 50°C. Typically, the<br>
temperature is monitored to minimize clumping of floss particles during this operation. If any<br>
clumping occurs, the floss particles must be sieved before being further processed into tablets.<br>
Heating times of about 5 to about 30 minutes are typical.<br>
When ethanol is used as a crystallization enhancer, it is used in amounts, based<br>
upon the weight of the matrix, of about 0.1% to about 10%, with amounts of about 0.5% to<br>
about 8.0% being very effective. The preformed matrix is contacted with ethanol. Excess<br>
ethanol is evaporated by drying for about an hour at about 85° F. to about 100° F., with 95° F.<br>
being highly useful. The drying step is carried out using tray drying, a jacketed mixer or other<br>
suitable method. Following ethanol treatment, the matrix becomes partially re-crystallized on<br>
standing for a period ranging from about a few hours up to several weeks. When the floss is<br>
about 10% to about 30% re-crystallized, it is tableted after blending with other ingredients. The<br>
tableting compositions flow readily and are cohesive.<br>
Re-crystallization of the matrix may take place in the presence of one or more bio-<br>
affecting agents or other additives.<br>
Re-crystallization of the matrix can be monitored by measuring the transmittance of<br>
polarized light therethrough or by the use of a scanning electron microscope. Amorphous floss<br>
or shearform matrix does not transmit polarized light and appears black in the light microscope<br><br><br>
when viewed with polarized light. Using bright field microscopy or the scanning electron<br>
microscope, the surface of the floss appears very smooth. In this condition, it is 0% re-<br>
crystallized. That is, the floss is 100% amorphous.<br>
Re-crystallization of amorphous matrix starts at the surface of the mass and can be<br>
modified, e.g., accelerated, by the presence of crystallization modifiers, as well as moisture.<br>
When TWEEN®s assist the re-crystallization, initiation of re-crystallization is evidenced by a<br>
birefringence observed on the surface of the shearform matrix (floss) as viewed with polarized<br>
light. There are faint points of light riddled throughout the matrix surface. When birefringence<br>
appears, re-crystallization has begun. At this stage, re-crystallization is between about 1% and<br>
about 5%.<br>
As re-crystallization proceeds, the birefringence on the surface of the matrix grows<br>
continually stronger and appears brighter. The points of light grow in size, number and<br>
intensity, seeming to almost connect. Using bright field or scanning electron microscopy, the<br>
surface of the matrix appears wrinkled. At this point, about 5 to 10% recrystallization has<br>
occurred.<br>
Surfactant (e.g., TWEEN® 80) droplets become entrapped within the matrix. These<br>
droplets are obscured as re-crystallization proceeds. As long as they are visible, the floss is<br>
generally not more than about 10% to about 20% re-crystallized. When they are no longer<br>
observable, the extent of re-crystallization is no more than about 50%.<br>
The re-crystallization of the matrix results in reduction of the total volume of<br>
material. Ordered assays of molecules take up less space than disordered arrays. Since re-<br>
crystallization begins at the surface of the floss, a crust is formed which maintains the size and<br>
shape of the floss. There is an increase in the total free volume space within the floss as re-<br>
crystallization nears completion, which manifests itself as a void inside the floss. This is<br>
evidenced by a darkened central cavity in light microscopy and a hollow interior in scanning<br>
electron microscopy. At this stage, the floss is believed to be about 50% to about 75% re-<br>
crystallized.<br>
The intensity of transmitted polarized light increases as the floss becomes more<br>
crystalline. The polarized light can be measured by a photon detector and assigned a value<br>
against calculated standards on a gray-scale.<br>
The final observable event in the recrystallization of floss is the appearance of fine,<br>
"cat whisker-like" needles and tiny blades, which grow and project from the surface of the floss.<br>
These crystals, believed to be sorbitol (cat whiskers) and xylitol (blades), literally cover the<br>
floss like a blanket of fuzz. These features can be easily recognized by both light and electron<br>
microscopes. Their appearance indicates the final stage of recrystallization. The floss is now<br>
about 100% re-crystallized, i.e., substantially non-amorphous.<br><br>
The matrix portions of the tabletable composition are typically formed via flash-heat<br>
processing into floss. The floss strands are macerated or chopped into rods for further<br>
processing. Rods of chopped floss have lengths of about 50μm to about 500μm.<br>
Other ingredients, which may be included are fillers and other conventional tablet<br>
additives. Additional fragrances, dyes, flavors, sweeteners (both artificial and natural) may<br>
also be included, if necessary even though the microspheres to be incorporated into the floss<br>
are already taste-masked.<br>
For example, fillers may be used to increase the bulk of the tablet. Some of the<br>
commonly used fillers are calcium sulfate, both di- and tri-basic; starch; calcium carbonate;<br>
microcrystalline cellulose; modified starches, lactose, sucrose; mannitol and sorbitol. Direct<br>
compression fillers may replace shearform for the same function.<br>
If necessary, additional flavorings, sweeteners, dyes and fragrances to be added to<br>
the floss may be chosen from the non-limiting lists described above.<br>
Effervescent disintegration agent(s) may also be added. The positive organoleptic<br>
sensation achieved by the effervescent action in the mouth, as well as the texture, speed and<br>
sensation of disintegration, aid in masking undesirable flavor notes.<br>
"Effervescent" refers to those agents, which evolve gas. The gas- or bubble-<br>
generating action is often the result of the reaction of a soluble acid source and a carbonate<br>
source. The reaction of these two general classes of compounds produces carbon dioxide gas<br>
upon contact with water in saliva. Useful acids include: citric, tartaric, malic, fuimaric, adipic,<br>
succinic and acid salts and anhydrides thereof. Acid salts may also include sodium dihydrogen<br>
phosphate, disodium dihydrogen pyrophosphate, acid citrate salts and sodium acid sulfite.<br>
While the food acids can be those indicated above, acid anhydrides of the above-described<br>
acids may also be used. Carbonate sources include dry solid carbonate and bicarbonate salts<br>
such as sodium bicarbonate, sodium carbonate, potassium bicarbonate and potassium<br>
carbonate, magnesium carbonate and sodium sesquicarbonate, sodium glycine carbonate, L-<br>
lysine carbonate, arginine carbonate and amorphous calcium carbonate. Mixtures of various<br>
acids and carbonate sources, as well as other sources of effervescence, can be used.<br>
The effervescent agent can be included in at least three different ways. The first<br>
method includes incorporating the entire effervescent agent in the feedstock, which is used to<br>
form the shearform product. The second involves adding the agent to an already formed<br>
shearform matrix. The third method incorporates one portion of the agent in the shearform<br>
matrix and adds another portion after formation of the matrix material. The artisan can<br>
determine the best way to use the agent for its effervescent properties.<br>
Other ingredients include binders, which contribute to the ease of formation and<br>
general quality of the tablet. Binders include starches, pregelatinized starches, gelatin,<br><br><br>
polyvinylpyrrolidone, methylcellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, ethylcellulose,<br>
polyacrylamides, polyvinyloxoazolidone and polyvinylalcohols.<br>
The following non-limiting examples illustrate the invention:<br><br>
Each of the weighed components are transferred into the Littleford FM130 mixer in<br>
the order specified below.<br>
1.	1 /2 of Distilled monogylceride ( DMG-03VF),<br>
2.	Zolpidem Tartrate,<br>
3.	Milled Gelucire® 50/31<br>
4.	Remainder of Distilled monogylceride ( DMG-03VF)<br>
Materials are blended for 10mins in total. 5 minutes with Choppers off, 5 minutes with<br>
Choppers on. The plow speed is 60Hz.<br>
The above blend was spheronized using the following process parameters. The<br>
process called for a % power input of about 22% to about 25% and a head speed of about<br>
45Hz. The process temperature of the microparticle blend was exposed to during the<br>
spheronization was about 92.8°C to about 133.6°C.<br>
Samples of the microparticles were taken from the beginning, middle, and end of<br>
the spheronizing process to show uniformity. Dissolution profiles are immediate and meet the<br>
NLT 80% (Q) at the 30-minute time-point. Assay values meet specification indicating that the<br>
microparticles contain a uniform amount of drug.<br>
In process samples were also taken during the screening step. All assay values<br>
are within target values and dissolution results are consistent. P.S.A. data is report value but<br>
the D50 is in the desired range of 200μm-300μm. The microparticle morphology was examined<br>
under a polarized light microscope and was reported as spherical and uniform in shape. Thus,<br><br>
the microparticles were deemed acceptable for coating and were brought forward to the next<br>
stage.<br>
The dissolution profile of the above microparticles is determined under the following<br>
dissolution conditions:<br>
Medium: 900 ml, pH 5.8 phosphate buffer.<br>
Method: USP Apparatus II at 50 rpm at 37°C + 0.5°C.<br>
The results are presented below as a % release of the total Zolpidem in the<br>
microparticles:<br><br>
The dissolution profile of the uncoated microparticles prepared as in Example 1 is<br>
shown in FIG.1.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
Coated Microparticles<br>
The microparticles are reproduced according to the same manufacturing process<br>
described above. The microparticles are then coated for taste masking with a coating solution<br>
containing a 60:30:10 ratio of NE30D:Talc:HPMC (Methocel®).<br>
The coating consists of a Eudragit NE30D / Talc / HPMC system. Eudragit NE30D<br>
is the main component of this system, which provides the barrier layer for successfully<br>
masking the taste of the drug and maintaining the in-vitro dissolution within the specified<br>
ranges. Eudragit NE30D is a neutral co-polymer of ethylacrylate and methytmethacrylate. It is<br>
supplied as a 30% aqueous dispersion. It is a pH-independent, permeable polymer. Thus,<br>
films produced from this polymer are insoluble in water, but allow pH-independent drug<br>
release.<br>
Hydroxy Propylmethycellulose (HPMC) is a substituted polymer of the natural<br>
carbohydrate cellulose. HPMC is very soluble in water and its hydrophilic nature affords a<br>
degree of permeability to the coating system necessary for the release of the drug from the<br>
core. Talc is a fine white crystalline powder. It is a purified, hydrated magnesium silicate and it<br>
acts as a glidant in coating solution formulations. Talc is added to this coating system to aid<br><br>
processing due to the susceptibility of the microparticles to agglomerate. The final formulation<br>
consists of a NE30D:Talc:HPMC ratio of 60:30:10. The solid content of this solution was<br>
20.29% w/w, which was made up with purified water.<br>
The solution was prepared by mixing the Talc into the water using a suitable mixer.<br>
Once the Talc and water is mixed it is processed through a Debee 2000 homogenizer at a<br>
pressure of 40,000PSI.<br>
Once the Talc/water slurry has been homogenized, the homogenate is replaced<br>
under the mixer and while stirring slowly the Methocel is added to the homogenate and<br>
allowed to mix until the Methocel E5 is dissolved. The resulting suspension is then cooled.<br>
The Eudragit® NE30D suspension is next screened from the product container<br>
through a 60-mesh screen into the final container. The Talc/Methocel suspension is also<br>
screened through a 60-mesh screen before it is added to the Eudragit® NE30D Suspension.<br>
Coating of the microparticles is carried out in a Glatt GPCG-60 with a wurster size<br>
of 18" and a 60mesh bottom screen. The parameters are set as indicated by the table below.<br>
The parameters are adjusted during the coating procedure to ensure adequate fluidization,<br>
minimize agglomeration and maintain a product temperature of 24-32°C.<br><br>
The initial flow rate for the solution is 70 (+/- 30) g/min. The flow rate increases as<br>
the process continues. The coating process is continued until the target weight gain is<br>
achieved. At this point the spraying process is terminated and the drying can commence.<br>
Once drying is completed the microparticles are removed form the Glatt chamber<br>
and are screened between 150-425um screens.<br>
The dissolution profile of the above-coated microparticles is determined under the<br>
following dissolution conditions:<br>
Medium: 900 ml, pH 5.8 phosphate buffer.<br>
Method: USP Apparatus II at 50 rpm at 37°C ± 0.5°C.<br><br>
The results are presented below as a % release of the total Zolpidem in the<br>
microparticles:<br><br>
The dissolution profile of the coated microparticles prepared as in Example 2 is<br>
shown in FIG.2<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
Floss/Matrix<br>
A preblend of about 78.25% sucrose, about 11% sorbitol, 10% xylitol and 0.75%<br>
TWEEN (Polysorbate) 80 was prepared.<br>
The floss preblend was processed using 5" crown head disclosed in U.S. Pat No.<br>
5,854,344 at a temperature of 250°C and a rotational speed of 60 Hz (3600 rpm). The floss<br>
collected was chopped in the Littleford FKM600 mixer with 2% lactose (2% w/w of the floss) for<br>
2 minutes at 100 rpm with the choppers on. 200 proof ethanol (0.5% based on weight of the<br>
floss) was sprayed on the chopped floss and mixed. The floss was then dried at 45°C for 90<br>
minutes with intermittent mixing. The dried floss was screened through a 20-mesh screen.<br><br><br><br>
Each of the weighed components is transferred into the Littleford FM130 mixer in<br>
the order specified below.<br>

7.	All of the Natural Debittering flavor,<br>
8.	All of the Syloid® 244FP;<br>
9.	All of the Intense Peppermint flavor;<br><br>
The above materials are blended for 5 minutes with Choppers off. The plow speed is 45Hz.<br>
The following component is next added and blended with Choppers off for a further 2 minutes.<br>
The plow speed is 45 Hz.:<br>
10.	All of the PRUV® (-40 mesh);<br>
Finally, the following component is added and blended for a further of 6 min, with Choppers off.<br>
The plow speed is 45 Hz.:<br>
11.	All of the FD&amp;C Blue color #2.<br>
The total tablet blend time is therefore 18 minutes. The blend is subsequently compressed<br>
into tablets.<br>
The resulting FlashDose™ tablets formed have a typical hardness value of about<br>
7N to about 13N and a typical tablet thickness of about 4.5 mm.<br>
The dissolution profile of the above FlashDose™ tablet is determined under the<br>
following dissolution conditions:<br>
Medium: 900 ml 0.1 N HCI, 900 ml pH 4.5 acetate buffer, 900 ml pH 5.8<br>
phosphate buffer, 900 ml pH 6.8 buffer<br>
Method: USP Apparatus II at 50 rpm at 37°C ± 0.5°C<br>
The FlashDose™ tablet produced the following dissolution profiles at the various pH<br>
values specified in the table below:<br><br>
The dissolution profiles of the 10 mg Zolpidem FlashDose™ tablet at the various pH<br>
values is shown in FIG. 3.<br>
The prior art 10mg Ambien® tablet produced the following dissolution profiles at the<br>
various pH values specified in the table below:<br><br><br>
The dissolution profiles of the prior art 10 mg Ambien® tablet at the various pH<br>

Given that the pharmacokinetics of Zolpidem tartrate exhibits a food effect, a<br>
comparative study was conducted to determine the bioavailability following a single-dose<br>
Zolpidem tartrate 10 mg FlashDose™ tablet of the invention and the 10 mg prior art Ambien®<br>
formulation (Lot OC81). The tablets were dosed at night for both fed (with or after a meal) and<br>
fasting conditions. Tables 1 and 2 below summarize the mean plasma Zolpidem<br>
concentrations (ng/ml) over a 24-hour period under fed and fasted conditions respectively:<br><br><br><br>
A comparison of the mean in vivo absorption rate of the Zolpidem tartrate 10 mg<br>
FlashDose™ tablet of the invention and the 10 mg prior art Ambien® formulation (Lot OC81)<br>
can be determined from the data above using the Wagner-Nelson numerical deconvolution<br>
method, a statistical method well known in the art and recognized by the US Food and Drug<br>
administration. Tables 3 and 4 below summarize the comparison absorption data over the first<br>
hour after administration of the two tablets under fed and fasted conditions respectively:<br><br><br><br><br>
Tables 5 and 6 provide the mean pharmacokinetic parameters for plasma Zolpidem<br>
after a single-dose Zolpidem tartrate 10 mg FlashDose™ tablet of the invention and the 10 mg<br>
prior art Ambien® formulation (Lot OC81) under fed and fasting conditions respectively. The<br>
tablets were dosed at night for both fed (within 30 minutes of the last meal) and fasting<br>
conditions (at least 4 hours after the last meal).<br><br><br><br>
The results reported in the Tables 1-6 and shown in FIGS. 5A-D and FIGS. 6A-D<br>
show that there is a significant enhancement in the absorption of the FlashDose™ tablet<br>
prepared in accordance with the present invention compared to the prior art 10mg Ambien®<br>
formulation in vivo. The absorption profiles generated from deconvolution analysis indicate<br>
that there is a significant difference in the in vivo absorption of Zolpidem from the FlashDose™<br>
tablet prepared in accordance with the present invention when compared to the prior art<br>
Ambien® formulation up to at least the first hour following administration of the tablet in both<br>
the fed and fasted state with a greater absorption of Zolpidem from the FlashDose™ tablet<br>
prepared in accordance with the present invention. ANOVA performed on the concentration at<br>
each time point also supports this observation, with statistically significant differences between<br>
the FlashDose™ tablet prepared in accordance with the present invention and the prior art<br>
Ambien® formulation at 0.25, 0.5 and 0.75 hours (FIG 4D and 5D). These results are<br>
particularly surprising given the observation that the in-vitro dissolution of the FlashDose™<br>
tablet prepared in accordance with the present invention is equal or slower at pH 6.8 than the<br>
reference marketed Zolpidem product Ambien®.<br><br>
