LARGE CRYSTAL ZSM-5, ITS SYNTHESIS AND USE<br>
This invention relates to large crystal ZSM-5, its synthesis and its use in catalytic processes.<br>
ZSM-5 and its synthesis using tetrapropylammonium (TPA) cations as a directing agent are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 3,702,886.  EP-A-21674 teaches that large crystal ZSM-5, having a crystal size in excess of 1 micron, can be prepared from a reaction mixture containing TPA cations provided the OH-/Si02 ratio is maintained within the range 0.01-0.07.<br>
Large crystal ZSM-5 (&gt;0.5 micron) usually can be prepared without difficulty when the aluminum content in the synthesis mixture is low.  As a result, with large crystal ZSM-5, although Si02/Al203 ratios of 100 or higher are relatively easily attainable, Si02/Al2C&gt;3 r.atios of 40 or lower are difficult to attain.<br>
In conventionally prepared, large ZSM-5 crystals, the aluminum distribution tends to be non-uniform with a significantly higher aluminum concentration (&gt;20%) being found on the outer surface, as compared with the interior, of the crystal.  Aluminum zoning in ZSM-5, especially in large crystals, has been reported.  See "Zoned Aluminum Distribution in Synthetic Zeolite ZSM-5", R. von Ballmoos &amp; W. M. Meier, Nature 1981, 289, 782-3; "Aluminum Distribution in Large ZSM-5 Crystals", K. J. Chao &amp; J. Y. Chern, Zeolites, 1988, 8, 82; "Aluminum Zoning in ZSM-5 As Revealed by Selective Silica Removal", R. M. Dessau, E. W. Valyocsik &amp; N. H. Goeke, Zeolites, 1992, 12, 776.<br>
Unexpectedly it has now been found that by using amino<br>
acids as the directing agent, "large crystal ZSM-5 of high<br>
aluminum content, Si02/Al203 = 25-40, can readily be<br>
obtained.  Moreover, the resultant large ZSM-5 crystals<br>
have essentially the same Si02/Al203 ratios in bulk (as<br>
measured by elemental and NMR analyses) and on the surface	~<br><br>
(as measured by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis (XPS) which determines the surface concentration and oxidation state of all detectable elements.)<br>
It is to be appreciated that, although ZSM-5 is normally synthesized as an aluminosilicate, the framework aluminum can be partially or completely replaced by other trivalent elements, such as boron, iron and/or gallium, and the framework silicon can be partially or completely replaced by other tetravalent elements such as germanium.<br>
In one aspect, the invention resides in a synthetic porous crystalline material having the structure of ZSM-5 and a composition involving the molar relationship:<br>
X203: (n)Y02, wherein -X is a trivalent element, such as aluminum, boron, iron and/or gallium, preferably aluminum; Y is a tetravalent element such as silicon and/or germanium, preferably silicon; and n is greater than about 12, and wherein the crystals have a major dimension of at least about 0.5 micron and a surface framework Y02/X203 ratio which is no more than 20% less than the bulk framework Y02/X203 ratio of the crystal.<br>
Preferably, the crystals have a major dimension of at least about 1 micron.<br>
Preferably, the surface framework Y02/ X203 ratio is no more than 10% less than the bulk framework Y02/X203 ratio of<br>
the crystal.<br>
Preferably, n is less than about 100 and more preferably is about 25 to about 40.<br>
Preferably, the crystallitie material exhibits a sorption time for 2,2-dimethylbutane for 30% of its capacity, as measured at 120°C and 60 torr (8 kPa) hydrocarbon pressure, of at least 5 minutes, preferably at least 10 minutes.<br><br>
In a further aspect, the invention resides in a synthetic porous crystalline material having the structure of ZSM-5 and a Toluene Disproportionation Index (as hereinafter defined) of less than 430, and preferably less than 400.<br>
In yet a further aspect, the invention resides in a method of synthesizing said porous crystalline material having the structure of ZSM-5 comprising the steps of forming a reaction mixture containing sources of an alkali or alkaline-earth metal oxide, a trivalent metal oxide x2°3' a tetravalent metal oxide YO2* water, and an amino acid or salt thereof having the formula:<br><br>
wherein R]_ is NH2/ NHR3 where R3 is an adamantyl or cyclic alkyl group, or a carboxylic acid group or salt thereof; R2 is H, alkyl, aryl, alkaryl, NH2 or NHR3 where R3 is an adamantyl or cyclic alkyl group; provided that at least one of Ri and R2 is NH2 or NHR3/ A is H 6r a metal and z is from 0 to 15, provided that at least one of R^ and R2 is NH2 or NHR3, and crystallizing the reaction mixture to produce said porous crystalline material.<br>
Preferably, the amino acid or salt thereof is selected from 6-aminohexanoic acid, lysine, glutamic acid and<br>
monosodium glutamate.<br>
The invention will now be"more "particularly described with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:<br><br>
FIG. 1 is an x-ray diffraction pattern of the calcined ZSM-5 produced using N-2-adamantylglycine as the directing agent (Example 2).<br>
FIG. 2 is an x-ray diffraction pattern of the calcined ZSM-5 produced using N-cyclohexylglycine as the directing agent (Example 5).<br>
FIG. 3 is an x-ray diffraction pattern of the calcined ZSM-5 produced using 6-aminohexanoic acid as the directing agent (Example 6).<br>
FIG. 4 is a SEM of the ZSM-5 synthesized with N-2-adamantylglycine in Example 2.<br>
FIG. 5 is a SEM of the ZSM-5 synthesized with N-cyclohexylglycine in Example 4.<br>
FIG. 6 is a SEM of the ZSM-5 synthesized with 6-aminohexanoic acid in Example 6.<br>
FIG. 7 is a SEM of the ZSM-5 synthesized with monosodium glutamate in Example 19.<br>
The present invention provides a novel form of large crystal ZSM-5 having a composition involving the molar<br>
relationship:<br>
X203: (n)Y02,<br>
wherein X is a trivalent element, such as aluminum, boron,<br>
iron and/or gallium, preferably aluminum; Y is a<br>
tetravalent element such as silicon and/or germanium,<br>
preferably silicon; and n is greater than about 12,<br>
preferably less than 100 and most preferably 25-40, and<br>
wherein the crystals have a surface framework YO2/X2O3<br>
ratio which is no more than 20% less, and preferably no<br>
more than 10% less, than the bulk framework YO2/X2O3 ratio<br>
of the crystal.<br>
The term "large crystal" ZSM-5 is used herein to mean that the crystals have a major dimension, and preferably at least two dimensions, of at least about 0.5 micron, preferably at least 1 micron and most preferably about 1 to<br><br>
about 10 microns as measured by standard SEM techniques. The crystal size of ZSM-5 can also be deduced from sorption measurements, for example by measuring the rate of sorption of 2,2-dimethylbutane at 120°C and 60 torr (8 kPa) hydrocarbon pressure.  The crystal size is computed by applying the diffusion equation given by J. Crank, The Mathematics of Diffusion/ Clarendon Press, 52-56 (1957), for the rate of sorbate uptake by a solid whose diffusion properties can be approximated by a plane sheet model.  In addition, the diffusion constant of 2,2-dimethylbutane, D, under these conditions, is taken to be 1.5 x 10~14 cm2/sec. The relation between crystal size measured in microns, d, and diffusion time measured in minutes, tQ#3, the time required for the uptake of 30% capacity of hydrocarbon, is:<br>
d- 0.0704 x t0.3H The large crystal ZSM-5 according to the invention preferably has a sorption time, to.3/ of at least 5 minutes, and preferably at least 10 minutes.<br>
The novel ZSM-5 of the invention is characterized by a unique behavior when silicon-selectivated for use in the para-selective disproportionation of toluene. This unique behavior is reflected in the Toluene Disproportionation Index of the zeolite which is less than 430 and preferably less than 400. The Toluene Disproportionation Index is a convenient measure of the para-selectivity and toluene conversion activity of the zeolite, both of which properties are vital to the successful operation of a catalyst for converting toluene to para-xylene. The Toluene Disproportionation Index is measured by passing a 2wt% solution of hexamethyldisiloxane in toluene over a sample of the unbound zeolite in the hydrogen form at a temperature of 446°C, a pressure of 300 psig (2170 kPa), a WHSV of 3 and in the presence of hydrogen to provide a H2/toluene molar ratio of 2:1. A siliceous deposit is<br><br>
thereby produced on the zeolite which increases the selectivity of the zeolite for the conversion of the toluene to para-xylene. The reaction products are sampled at regular intervals and analyzed by gas chromatography and, when the para-xylene selectivity reaches 90% by weight of the total C8 component, the hexamethyldisiloxane/toluene feed is changed to pure toluene and the temperature adjusted to produce a toluene conversion level of 30wt%. The reaction temperature (°C) at which the the p-xylene selectivity is 90wt% and the toluene conversion is 30wt% is the defined as the Toluene Disproportionation Index (TDI).<br>
The novel large crystal ZSM-5 of the invention is produced from a reaction containing sources of an alkali or alkaline-earth metal (M) oxide, a trivalent metal oxide x2°3'  a tetravalent metal oxide Y02, water, and an amino acid or salt thereof (AA) having the formula:<br><br>
wherein Ri is NH2, NHR3 where R3 is an adamantane or cyclic alkyl group, or is a carboxylic acid group or salt thereof; R2 is H, alkyl, aryl, alkaryl, NH2 or NHR3 where R3 is an adamantane or cyclic alkyl group; A is H or a metal and z is from 0 to 15, preferably 1-7; provided that at least one of R]_ and R2 is NH2 or NHR3. Examples of suitable amino acids are 6-aminohexanoic acid, N-2-adamantylglycine, N-cyclohexylglycine, lysine, and"" glutamic acid (and its monosodium salt).<br>
The reaction mixture has a composition, expressed in terms of mole ratios of oxides, as follows:<br><br><br>
The synthesis method of the invention functions with or without added nucleating seeds.  In a preferred embodiment, the reaction mixture contains no nucleating seeds.  The preferred aluminum source is NaA102/ while the preferred silicon source is Si02 sol (30% Si02 in H20) , which is commercially available as Catalog No. SX0140-1 from EM Science, Inc.<br>
Crystallization is carried out under either stirred or static conditions at a temperature of 80 to 225°C, preferably 120 to 200°C, for 24 hours to 60 days and the resultant ZSM-5 crystals are separated from the mother liquor and recovered.<br>
Since the large crystal ZSM-5 of the invention can be synthesized with a relatively low silica/alumina molar ratio (that is with a relatively high aluminum content), the invention can be used to produce large crystal ZSM-5 with a high catalytic activity.  Catalytic activity of zeolites, such as ZSM-5, is typically measured by Alpha Value, which compares the catalytic cracking activity of the catalyst (rate of normal hexane conversion per volume of catalyst per unit time) with the activity of a standard silica-alumina cracking catalyst.  The Alpha Test is described in U.S. Patent No. 3/354,078; in the Journal of Catalysis, Vol. 4, p. 527 (1965); Vol. 6, p. 278 (1966); and Vol. 61, p. 395 (1980).  The experimental conditions of the test used herein include a constant temperature of 538EC and a variable flow rate as described in detail in the Journal of Catalysis, Vol. 61, p. 395. In the hydrogen<br><br>
form, the large crystal ZSM-5 of the invention preferably has an Alpha Value in excess of 300 and preferably in excess of 800.<br>
When used as a catalyst, it may be desirable to incorporate ZSM-5 of the invention with another material resistant to the temperatures and other conditions employed in organic conversion processes.  Such materials include active and inactive materials and synthetic or naturally occurring zeolites as well as inorganic materials such as clays, silica and/or metal oxides such as alumina.  The latter may be either naturally occurring or in the form of gelatinous precipitates or gels including mixtures of silica and metal oxides.  Use of a material which is active,•tends to change the conversion and/or selectivity of the catalyst in certain organic conversion processes. Inactive materials suitably serve as diluents to control the amount of conversion in a given process so that products can be obtained economically and orderly without employing other means for controlling the rate of reaction. These materials may be incorporated into naturally occurring clays, e.g., bentonite and kaolin, to improve the crush strength of the catalyst under commercial operating conditions.  Said materials, i.e., clays, oxides, etc., function as binders for the catalyst.  It is desirable to provide a catalyst having good crush strength because in commercial use it is desirable to prevent the catalyst from breaking down into powder-like materials.  These clay and/or oxide binders have been employed normally only for the purpose of improving the crush strength of the catalyst.<br>
Naturally occurring clays which can be composited with the new crystal include the montmorillonite and kaolin<br>
family, which families include the subbentonites, and the   	<br>
kaolins commonly known as Dixie, McNamee, Georgia and<br><br>
Florida clays or others in which the main mineral constituent is halloysite, kaolinite, dickite, nacrite, or anauxite.  Such clays can be used in the raw state as originally mined or initially subjected to calcination, acid treatment or chemical modification.<br>
In addition to the foregoing materials, the ZSM-5 can be composited with a porous matrix material such as silica-alumina, silica-magnesia, silica-zirconia, silica-thoria, silica-beryllia, silica-titania as well as ternary compositions such as silica-alumina-thoria, silica-alumina-zirconia silica-alumina-magnesia and silica-magnesia-zirconia.<br>
The relative proportions of finely divided ZSM-5 material'and inorganic oxide matrix vary widely, with the ZSM-5 content ranging from about 1 to about 90% by weight and more usually, particularly when the composite is prepared in the form of beads, in the range of about 2 to about 80 wt.% of the composite.<br>
The large crystal ZSM-5 of the invention is useful as a catalyst for aromatics alkylation and transalkylation processes, such as toluene disproportionation, and other shape-selective processes which typically use ZSM-5 or other medium pore zeolites as catalysts.<br>
In order to more fully illustrate the nature of the invention and the manner of practicing same, the following examples are presented.<br><br>
Example 1<br>
Synthesis of N-2-adamantylglycine<br>
A 600 ml stainless steel Parr reactor, equipped with a stirrer, two inlets, one with a tubing reaching nearly to the bottom of the reactor, and an outlet was used.  Into the open reactor there were charged 100 grams of glycine (Aldrich, 99+%), 206,7 grams of 2-adamantanone (Aldrich, 99%), 10 grams of palladium (5%) on charcoal, and 300 grams of glacial acetic acid.  The reactor was closed and dry nitrogen was passed through said one inlet into the reaction mixture to replace the air in the reaction mixture and in the reactor.  The nitrogen was turned off and the reactor was pressurized with hydrogen through the other inlet.  Under a hydrogen pressure of 725 psig (5100 kPa) , the reaction mixture was heated to 100°C and stirred at this temperature for 5 days. After cooling down to room temperature, the excess hydrogen was vented from the reactor and the reactor was opened.  The mixture was filtered by suction to remove the solid Pd/C catalyst.  The filtrate was evaporated to remove the acetic acid and water.  The crude product was washed with ether and recrystallized from a dilute aqueous solution.  A pure product was obtained after two recrystallization. Elemental analysis: Calculated for C12H17N02: C:68.67; H:9.15; N:6.69.  Found C:68.85; H:9.12; N:6.75. M.P.:255.4 C (by DSC at 10 C/min. under He).<br>
Example 2<br>
ZSM-5 synthesis using N-2-adaitiantylglycine<br>
A stock solution of NaOH and NaA102 in deionized H2O was prepared by dissolving 16.26 grams {0.198 moles) anhydrous NaA102/ 43.55 grams NaOH (1.09 moles) in 2925<br>
grams (162.5 moles) H20. To 268.8 grams of the NaA102/NaOH  -■■•	<br>
stock solution were added 6.1 grams (0.029 moles) N-2-<br><br>
damantylglycine.  The template was not readily soluble at room temperature but a clear solution was formed upon heating to 75°C.  To this clear solution was added 58.1 grams Si02 sol (30% or 17.4 grams or 0.29 moles SiC&gt;2) with vigorous stirring and a gel was formed. The gel had the following molar composition:<br>
Si02/Al203	- 32.5<br>
Al203/Na20	=0.18<br>
H20/Si02	= 50<br>
Na+/Si02	=0.4<br>
OH-/Si02	=0.34<br>
Directing agent/Si02    =0.1 An amount of 330.2 grams of the gel was transferred into a 600 ml Parr reaction.  The reactor was closed and flushed with nitrogen.  The mixture was heated to 165°C under a nitrogen pressure of 400-450 psig with stirring. Approximately 2 hours after the temperature reached 165*C the stirrer was stopped and the mixture was allowed to age statically for 24 hours.  The stirrer was again turned on and the reaction was carried out at 165°C for 11 days. Upon cooling the reactor was opened, and the solid product was separated by filtration.  The crystalline product was washed with water, dried and then calcined at 538°C for 10 hours in nitrogen followed by 10 hours in air.  X-ray diffraction gave the pattern of FIG. 1 and showed that the product was ZSM-5 with high crystallinity.  The Si02/Al203 molar ratio was analyzed to be 37.3 and the hydrogen form of the zeolite had an alpha value of 1454.<br>
Scanning electron micrographs of the ammonium form of the product are given in FIG. 4 and indicate the crystal size to be in excess of 1 micron.<br><br>
Example 3<br>
Synthesis of cyclohexylglycine<br>
Similar equipment and procedure as described in Example 1 were employed.  75.5 grams glycine (1.01 moles, Aldrich, 99+%), 118.4 grams cyclohexanone (1.21 moles, Aldrich 99.8%), 300 ml glacial acetic acid and 11.2 grams of Pd (5%)/C were used.  The reaction was carried out in a 600 ml Parr reactor under 1000 psig (7000 kPa) hydrogen pressure at 75°C.  No noticeable hydrogen uptake was noticed after 1.5 days, and the reaction was carried out for 4.5 days.  The reactor was opened after cooling to room temperature.  The solid catalyst was filtered by suction. The filtrate was evaporated to remove the acetic acid and the excess cyclohexanone.  A viscous crude product (brown) remained which started to crystallize upon cooling to room temperature.  The crude product was stirred into excess ether whereby a white solid precipitated out.  The solid was filtered,  washed with ether and dried.  The solid was redissolved in a very ^mall amount of acetic acid and recrystallized by adding an appropriate amount of ether. 144.5 grams of white crystals were recovered (91% yield based on glycine).  Elemental analysis: calculated: C:61.12; H:9.62; N:8.91; 0:20.36; found: C:60.96; H:9.75; N:8.88; 0:20.41.<br>
Example 4<br>
ZSM-5 synthesis using N-cyclohexylglycine<br>
To 400 grams NaAlC^/NaOH stock solution used in example 2 were added 11.5 grams N-cyclohexylglycine (0.073 moles).  A clear solution was formed at room temperature. The solution was heated to 70-75EC before the addition of<br>
86.4 grams of SiC&gt;2 sol (30% S1O2 in H2O) .  A thin gel was	<br>
formed: N-cyclohexylglycine/Si02 - 0.17; pH of gel = 12.7. The gel was transferred into a 600 ml Parr reactor.  The<br><br>
reactor was closed and purged with nitrogen.  The reaction was heated to and stirred at 165°C for an hour.  The stirrer was stopped and the reaction was aged statically at 165°C for 24 hours.  The stirrer was restarted and the reaction was carried out at 165°C for 7 days.  The reactor was opened after cooling.  The product was filtered, washed with water until the washing was neutral and dried at 110°C under vacuum.  The as synthesized zeolite was identified to be ZSM-5, with Si02/Al203 « 22.2.<br>
Scanning electron micrographs of the product are given in FIG. 5 and indicate the crystal size to be in excess of<br>
1	micron.<br>
Example' 5<br>
ZSM-5 synthesis using 6-aminohexanoic acid<br>
To 200 grams of NaAlC&gt;2/NaOH stock solution of Example<br>
2	were added 4.72 grams 6-aminohexanoic acid (Aldrich 98%,<br>
0.036 moles).  A clear solution was formed at room<br>
temperature.  The mixture was heated to 70-75°C and 43.21<br>
grams of Si02 sol (30% Si(&gt;2 in H2O) were added to from a<br>
thin gel. The gel was transferred to a Parr reactor and<br>
heated at 165°C with stirring. After 1 hour, the stirring<br>
was stopped and the mixture was aged statically at 165°C<br>
for 24 hours.  The stirring was restarted and the reaction<br>
was carried out at 165°C for 8 days. A crystalline product<br>
identified by x-ray diffraction as ZSM-5 was obtained.<br>
Scanning electron photomicrographs (FIG. 6) showed that the<br>
ZSM-5 contained large crystals (&gt;1 micron).  Elemental<br>
analysis gave the Si02/Al2C&gt;3 as 25.8, whereas NMR<br>
determinations of framework Al and Si gave a Si02/Al2C&gt;3<br>
ratio of 28.8.  The alpha value of the zeolite in the<br>
hydrogen form was determined to be 998.<br><br>
Example 6<br>
Example 5 was repeated with a reaction mixture having the following composition in molar ratios:<br>
Si02/Al203	= 29.2<br>
Na+/SiC&gt;2	= °*44<br>
6-aminohexanoic acid/Si02    =0*19<br>

The water was charged into the one-gallon reactor. With stirring the NaOH was added.  When a clear solution was formed, the NaA102 was added.  The mixture was stirred until complete dissolution.  The solution was heated to 70-75°C and'the Si(&gt;2 sol was added with stirring.  A thin gel was formed.  The reactor was closed and heated to 165°C with stirring at 100 rpm.  After stirring at 165°C for 1.9 hours, the stirrer was turned off and the mixture was allowed to age statically for 24 hours.  The stirrer was restarted and the reaction was carried out at I65°c for 2 days.  The reactor was opened after cooling to room temperature.  The product was filtered by suction and washed to neutral pH with deionized water.  The as-synthesized zeolite was dried.  Five grams were calcined in air at 538°C for 10 hours.  The calcined zeolite was exchanged with 1 N NH4NO3 and recalcined in air to give the H+ form.  X-ray diffraction (FIG. 3) showed that the product was ZSM-5 and SEM (FIG. 6) showed large crystals were formed.  Elemental analysis revealed Si:35.57% and Al:3.09%, corresponding to a mole ratio of Si02/Al203 of 22.1. The alpha value was determined to be &gt;1000. The Toluene Diproportionation Index (TDI) of the zeolite was measured to be 392.<br><br>

6-aminohexanoic acid/Si02    = 0,31<br>
H20/Si02	=70.6<br>
The H20 was added into a one-gallon Parr reactor. The NaOH, NaA102, and the 6-aminohexanoic acid were successively dissolved into the H20.  At room temperature and with stirring, the Si02 sol was added to the mixture and a thin gel was formed.  The reactor was closed, pressurized with 148 psi nitrogen, and stirred at 100 rpm at room'temperature for an hour.  The stirrer was stopped and the mixture was aged statically at room temperature for 24 hours.  The reaction mixture was heated to 185°C with stirring at 100 rpm.  After 24 hours, a sample was taken. X-ray diffraction showed that the product had started to crystallize. The reaction was terminated after 2 days.  X-ray diffraction showed that the product was highly crystalline ZSM-5.<br>

Based on the elemental analysis the bulk framework SiC&gt;2/Al203 ratio was calculated to be 30.8.  The surface concentration of all elements of the same zeolite was determined by XPS analysis.  Atomic concentration of Si and Al detected Si: 25.3 and Al: 1.7.  The surface framework Si02/Al2C&gt;3 ratio was calculated to be 30.0.<br>
Similarly, the bulk and surface framwork Si02/Al23 ratios of a conventionally prepared large crystal ZSM-5 were determined.  A comparison of results between the conventionally prepared large crystal ZSM-5 and the large crystal ZSM-5 prepared according to this Example is shown below.<br>
