Related. Application<br>
This application is a continuation-in-part application of U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 08/479,436 filed June 7, 1995.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
This inveiltion relates to neurotrophic compounds having an affinity for FKBP-type immunophilins, their preparation and use as inhibitors of the enzyme activity associated with immunophilin proteins, and particularly inhibitors of peptidyl-prolyl isomerase or rotamase enzyme activity.<br>
2.	Description of the Prior Art<br>
The term immunophilin refers to a number of proteins that serve as receptors for the principal immunosuppressant drugs, cyclosporin A (CsA) , FK506, and rapamycin.  Known classes of immunophilins are cyclophilins, and FK506 binding proteins, such as FKBP. Cyclosporin A binds to cyclophilin while FK506 and rapamycin bind to FKBP.  These immunophilin-drug complexes interface with a variety of intracellular signal transduction systems, especially in the immune system and the nervous system,<br>
Immunophilins are known to have peptidyl-prolyl<br>
isomerase or<br>
rotamase enzyme activity.<br>
2. Description of the Prior Art<br>
The term immunophilin refers to a number of<br>
proteins that serve as receptors for the principal<br>
immunosuppressant drugs, cyclosporin A (CsA), FK506,<br>
and rapamycin. Known classes of immunophilins are<br>
cyclophilins, and FK506 binding proteins, such as FKBP.<br>
Cyclosporin A binds to cyclophilin while FK506 and<br>
rapamycin bind to FKBP. These immunophilin-drug<br>
complexes interface with a variety of intracellular<br>
signal transduction systems, especially in the immune<br>
system and the nervous system.<br>
Immunophilins are known to have peptidyl-prolyl<br>
isomerase (PPIase) or rotamase enzyme activity. It has<br>
been determined that rotamase activity has a role in<br>
the catalyzation of the interconversion of the cis and<br>
trans isomer of immunophilin proteins.<br>
Immunophilins were originally discovered and<br>
studied in immune tissue. It was initially postulated<br>
by those skilled in the art that inhibition of the<br>
immunophilins rotamase activity leads to the inhibition<br>
of T-cell proliferation, thereby causing the<br>
immunosupprespive action exhibited by immunosuppressive<br>
drugs such as- cyclosporin A, FK506, and rapamycin.<br>
Further study has shown that the inhibition of rotamase<br>
activity, in and of itself, is not sufficient for<br>
immunosuppressant activity. Schreiber et al., Science,<br>
1990 vol. 250 pp. 556-559. It has been shown that the<br>
immunophilin-drug complexes interact with ternary<br>
protein targets as their mode of action. Schreiber et<br>
al., Cell, 1991, vol. 66, pp. 807-815. In the case of<br>
FKBP-FK506 and FKBP-CsA, the drug-immunophilin<br>
complexes bind to the enzyme calcineurin, inhibitory Tcell<br>
receptor signalling leading to T-cell<br>
proliferation. Similarly, the complex of rapamycin and<br>
FKBP interacts with the RAFT1/FRAP protein and inhibits<br>
signalling from the IL-2 receptor.<br>
Immunophilins have been found to be present at<br>
high concentrations in the central nervous system.<br>
Immunophilins are enriched 10-50 times more in the<br>
central nervous system than in the immune system.<br>
Within neural tissues, immunophilins appear to<br>
influence neuronal process extension, nitric oxide<br>
synthesis, and neurotransmitter release.<br>
It has been found that picomolar concentrations of<br>
an immunosuppressant such as FK506 and rapamycin<br>
stimulate neurite out growth in PC12 cells and sensory<br>
nervous, namely dorsal root ganglion cells (DRGs).<br>
Lyons et al., Proc. of Natl. Acad. Sci., 1994 vol. 91,<br>
pp. 3191-3195. In whole animal experiments, FK506 has<br>
been shown to stimulate nerve regeneration following<br>
i<br>
facial nerve .injury and results in functional recovery<br>
in animals with sciatic nerve lesions.<br>
Surprisingly, it has been found that drugs with a<br>
high affinity for FKBP are potent rotamase inhibitors<br>
causing a neurotrophic effect. Lyons et al. These<br>
findings suggest the use of immunosuppressants in<br>
treating various peripheral neuropathies and enhancing<br>
neuronal regrowth in the central nervous system (CNS).<br>
Studies have demonstrated that neurodegenerative<br>
disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's<br>
disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) may<br>
occur due to the loss, or decreased availability, of a<br>
neurotrophic substance specific for a particular -<br>
population of neurons affected in the disorder.<br>
Several neurotrophic factors effecting specific<br>
neuronal populations in the central nervous system have<br>
been identified. For example, it has been hypothesized<br>
that Alzheimer's disease results from a decrease or<br>
loss of nerve growth factor (NGF). It has thus been<br>
proposed to treat Alzheimer's patients with exogenous<br>
nerve growth factor or other neurotrophic proteins such<br>
as brain derived nerve factor (BDNF), glial derived<br>
nerve factor, ciliary neurotrophic factor, and<br>
neurotropin-3 to increase the survival of degenerating<br>
neuronal populations.<br>
Clinical application of these proteins in various<br>
neurological disease states is hampered by difficulties<br>
in the delivery and bioavailability of large proteins<br>
to nervous system targets. By contrast,<br>
immunosuppressant drugs with neurotrophic activity are<br>
relatively small and display excellent bioavailability<br>
and specificity. However, when administered<br>
chronically, immunosuppressants exhibit a number of<br>
potentially serious side effects including<br>
nephrotox'icity, such as impairment of glomerular<br>
filtration and irreversible interstitial fibrosis (Kopp<br>
et al., 1991, J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1:162); neurological<br>
deficits, such as involuntary tremors, or non-specific<br>
cerebral angina such as non-localized headaches (De<br>
Groen et al., 1987, N. Engl. J. Med. 317:861); and<br>
vascular hypertension with complications resulting<br>
therefrom (Kahan et al., 1989 N. Engl. J. Med. 321:<br>
1725) .<br>
In order to prevent the side effects associated<br>
with use of the immunosuppressant compounds, the<br>
present invention provides non-immunosuppressive<br>
compounds containing small molecule FKBP rotamase<br>
inhibitors for promoting neuronal growth and<br>
regeneration in various neuropathological situations<br>
where neuronal repair can be facilitated including<br>
peripheral nerve damage by physical injury or disease<br>
state such as diabetes, physical damage to the central<br>
nervous system (spinal cord and brain) brain damage<br>
associated with stroke, and for the treatment of<br>
neurological disorders relating to neurodegeneration,<br>
including Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and<br>
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a novel class of<br>
neurotrophic compounds having an affinity for FKBP-type<br>
immunophilins. Once bound to this protein the<br>
neurotrophic compounds are potent inhibitors of the<br>
enzyme activity associated with immunophilin proteins<br>
and particularly rotamase enzyme activity, thereby<br>
stimulating neuronal regeneration and outgrowth. A key<br>

Sprague-Dawley rats were crushed at the level of the<br>
hips. Example 1 (30 mg/kg s.c.), Inactive (30 mg/kg<br>
s.c.) or intralipid vehicle was administered once daily<br>
for the next 21 days. Animals were sacrificed, sciatic<br>
nerves removed and nerve 'segments 2 mm distal to the<br>
crush site were sectioned and stained with Holmes<br>
silver stain (to assess axon number) and Luxol fast<br>
blue (to assess remyelination). The micrographs show<br>
sciatic nerve sections of sham operated rats,<br>
vehicle-treated lesioned animals, Example 1 and<br>
Inactive treated at 630x magnification, four animals<br>
per group.<br>

Striatal Membrane Protein. Figure 4 shows that<br>
neuroimmunophiLin ligands of the present invention<br>
promote recovery of dopamine neurons following MPTP<br>
treatment of mice. GDI mice (25 g) were treated daily<br>
with 30 mg/kg MPTP (i.p.) for 5 days. The animals were<br>
also treated daily with intralipid vehicle, Example 1<br>
(100 mg/kg s.c.) or Example 17 (40, 20, 10 mg/kg s.c.,<br>
as indicated) concurrently with the MPTP and continued<br>
for an additional 5 days. After eighteen days, the<br>
mice were sacrificed, striata from 5 animals per group<br>
were pooled and processed into a washed membrane<br>
preparation. Binding of [3H]-CFT to these striated<br>
membrane preparations of various groups was quantitated<br>
to determine dopamine transporter levels on viable<br>
nerve terminals. Binding in the presence of 10 /iM<br>
unlabelled CFT provided on estimate of nonspecific<br>
binding, which was subtracted from the total binding to<br>
quantitative specific [3H]-CFT bound. Binding was<br>
normalized to the protein content of the striatal<br>
membranes from each experimental group. Coronal and<br>
saggital brain sections from MPTP and drug treated<br>
animals were stained with anti-tyrosine hydroxylase<br>
(TH) Ig to quantitate striatal, medial forebrain<br>
bundle axonal and nigral levels of TH, which is<br>
indicative of functional dopaminergic neurons.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The novel neurotrophic compounds of this invention<br>
are relatively small molecules in relation to other<br>
known compounds which bind to FKBP-type immunophilins,<br>
such as rapamycin, FK506, and cyclosporin.<br>
The neurotrophic compounds of this invention have<br>
an affinity for" the FK506- binding proteins such as<br>
FKBP-12. When the neurotrophic compounds of the<br>
invention are bound to the FKBP, they have been found<br>
to unexpectedly inhibit the prolyl- peptidyl cis-trans<br>
isomerase activity, or rotamase activity of the binding<br>
protein and stimulate neurite growth, while not<br>
exhibiting an immunosuppressant effect.<br>

The compounds of this invention exist as<br>
stereoisomeric forms, either enantiomers or<br>
diastereoisomers. The stereochemistry at position 1<br>
(Formula 1) is R or S, with S preferred. Included<br>
within the scope of the invention are the enantiomers,<br>
the racemic form, and diastereoisomeric mixtures.<br>
Enantiomers as well as diastereoisomers can be<br>
separated by methods known to those skilled in the art.<br>
It is known that immunophilins such as FKBP<br>
preferentially recognize peptide substrates containing<br>
Xaa-Pro-Yaa motifs, where Xaa and Yaa are lipophilic<br>
amino acid residues. Schreiber et al. 1990 J. Org.<br>
Chem. 55, 4984-4986; Harrison and Stein, 1990<br>
Biochemistry, 29, 3813-38'!6. Thus modified prolyl<br>
peptidomimetic compounds bearing lipophilic<br>
substituents should bind with high affinity to the<br>
hydrophobic core of the FKBP active site and inhibit<br>
its rotamase activity.<br>
Preferred compounds of the present invention<br>
include Rx groups which are not stereochemically bulky<br>
in relation to the known shape and size of the<br>
hydrophobic core of the FKBP active site. Thus, very<br>
large and/or highly substituted Rx groups would bind<br>
with less affinity to the FKBP active site.<br>

The compounds of the present invention can be used<br>
in the form of salts derived from inorganic or organic<br>
acids and bases. Included among such acid salts are<br>
the following: acetate, adipate, alginate, aspartate,<br>
benzoate, benzenesulfonate, bisulfate butyrate,<br>
citrate, camphorate, camphorsulfonate,<br>
cyclopentanepropionate, digluconate, dodecylsulfate,<br>
ethanesulfonate, fumarate, glucoheptanoate,<br>
glycerophosphate, hemissulfate heptanoate, hexanoate,<br>
hydrochloride, hydrobromide, hydroiodide, 2-<br>
hydroxyethanesulfonate, lactate, maleate,<br>
methanesulfonate, 2-naphthalensulfonate, nicotinate,<br>
oxalate, pamoate, pectinate, propionate, succinate,<br>
tartrate, thiocyanate, tosylate and undecanoate. Base<br>
salts include ammonium salts, alkali metal salts such<br>
as sodium and potassium salts, alkaline earth metal<br>
salts such as calcium and magnesium salts, salt with<br>
organic bases such as dicyclohexylamine salts, Nmethyl-<br>
D-glucamine, and salts with amino acids such as<br>
arginine, lysine, and so forth. Also, the basic<br>
nitrogen-containing groups can be quarternized with<br>
such agents as lower alkyl halides, such as methyl,<br>
ethyl, propyl, and butyl chloride, bromides and<br>
iodides; dialkyl sulfates like dimethyl, diethyl,<br>
dibutyl and diamyl sulfates, long chain halides such as<br>
decyl, lauryl, myristyl and stearyl chlorides, bromides<br>
and iodides, aralkyl halides like benzyl and phenethyl<br>
bromides and others. Water or oil-soluble or<br>
dispersible products are thereby obtained.<br>
The neurotrophic compounds of this invention can<br>
be periodically administered to a patient undergoing<br>
treatment for neurological disorders or for other<br>
reasons in which it is desirable to stimulate neuronal<br>
regeneration and growth, such as in various peripheral<br>
neuropathic and neurological disorders relating to<br>
neurodegeneration. The compounds of this invention can<br>
also be administered to mammals other than humans for<br>
treatment of various mammalian neurological disorders.<br>
ntraperitoneally, intrathecally, intraventricularly,<br>
intrasternal and intracranial injection or infusion<br>
techniques.<br>
To be effective therapeutically as central nervous<br>
system targets the immunophilin-drug complex should<br>
readily penetrate the blood-brain barrier when<br>
peripherally administered. Compounds of this invention<br>
which cannot penetrate the blood-brain barrier can be<br>
effectively administered by an intraventricular route.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions may be in the form<br>
of a sterile injectable preparation, for example as a<br>
sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous suspension.<br>
This suspension may be formulated according to<br>
techniques know in the art using suitable dispersing or<br>
wetting agents and suspending agents. The sterile<br>
injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable<br>
solution or suspension in a non-toxic parenterallyacceptable<br>
diluent or solvent, for example as a<br>
solution in 1,3-butanediol. Among the acceptable<br>
vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water,<br>
Ringer's solution and isotonic sodium chloride<br>
solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are<br>
conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending<br>
medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil may be<br>
employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides.<br>
Fatty acids such as oleic acid and its glyceride<br>
derivatives find use in the preparation of injectables,<br>
olive oil or castor oil, especially in their<br>
polyoxyethylated versions. These oil solutions or<br>
suspensions may also contain a long-chain alcohol<br>
diluent or dispersant.<br>
The compounds may be administered orally in the<br>
form of capsules or tablets, for example, or as an<br>
aqueous suspension or solution. In the case of tablets<br>
for oral use, carriers which are commonly used include<br>
lactose and corn starch. Lubricating agents, such as<br>
magnesium stearate, are also typically added. For oral<br>
administration .in a capsule form, useful diluents<br>
include lactose and dried corn starch. When aqueous<br>
suspensions are required for oral use, the active<br>
ingredient is combined with emulsifying,and suspending<br>
agents. If desired, certain sweetening and/or<br>
flavoring and/or coloring agents may be added.<br>
The compounds of this invention may also be<br>
administered in the form of suppositories for rectal<br>
administration of the drug. These compositions can be<br>
prepared by mixing the drug with a suitable nonirritating<br>
excipient which is solid at room temperature<br>
but liquid at rectal temperature and therefore will<br>
melt in the rectum to release the drug. Such materials<br>
include cocoa butter, beeswax and polyethylene glycols.<br>
The compounds of this invention may also be<br>
administered optically, especially when the conditions<br>
addressed for treatment involve areas or organs readily<br>
accessible by topical application, including<br>
neurological disorders of the eye, the skin, or the<br>
lower intestinal tract. Suitable topical formulations<br>
are readily prepared for each of these areas.<br>
For ophthalmic use, the compounds can be<br>
formulated as micronized .suspensions in isotonic, pH<br>
adjusted sterile saline, or, preferably, as solutions<br>
is isotonic, pH adjusted sterile saline, either with or<br>
without a preservative such as benzylalkonium chloride.<br>
Alternatively for the ophthalmic uses the compounds may<br>
be formulated in an ointment such as petrolatum.<br>
For application topically to the skin, the<br>
compounds can be formulated in a suitable ointment<br>
containing the compound suspended or dissolved in, for<br>
example, a mixture with one or more of the following:<br>
mineral oil, liquid petrolatum, white petrolatum,<br>
propylene glycol, polyoxyethylene polyoxypropylene<br>
compound, emulsifying wax and water. Alternatively,<br>
the compounds can be formulated in a suitable lotion or<br>
cream containing the active compound suspended or<br>
dissolved in, for example, a mixture of one or more of<br>
the following: mineral oil, sorbitan monostearate,<br>
polysorbate 60, cetyl esters wax, cetearyl alcohol, 2-<br>
octyldodecanol, benzyl alcohol and water.<br>
Topical application for the lower intestinal" tract<br>
an be effected in a rectal suppository formulation (see<br>
above) or in a suitable enema formulation.<br>
Dosage levels on the order of about .Img to about<br>
10,000 mg. of the active ingredient compound are useful<br>
in the treatment of the above conditions, with<br>
preferred levels of about 0.Img to about 1,000 mg. The<br>
amount of active ingredient that may be combined with<br>
the carrier materials to produce a single dosage form<br>
will vary depending upon the host treated and the<br>
particular mode of administration.<br>
It is understood, however, that a specific dose<br>
level for any particular patient will depend upon a<br>
variety of factors including the activity of the<br>
specific compound employed, the age, body weight,<br>
general health," sex, diet, time of administration, rate<br>
of excretion,'drug combination, and the severity of the<br>
particular disease being treated and form of<br>
administration.<br>
The compounds can be administered with other<br>
neurotrophic agents such as neurotrophic growth factor<br>
(NGF), glial derived growth factor, brain derived<br>
growth factor, ciliary neurotrophic factor, and<br>
neurotropin-3. The dosage level of other neurotrophic<br>
drugs will depend upon the factors previously stated<br>
and the neurotrophic effectiveness of the drug<br>
combination.<br>
li Test Procedure<br>
Inhibition of the peptidyl-prolyl isomerase -<br>
(rotamase) activity of the inventive compounds can be<br>
evaluated by known methods described in the literature<br>
(Harding, M.W. et al. .Nature 341: 758-760 (1989); Holt<br>
et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 115: 9923-9938) . These values<br>
are obtained as apparent K and are presented in<br>
Table I. The cis-trans isomerization of an alanineproline<br>
bond in a model substrate, N-succinyl-Ala-Ala-<br>
Pro-Phe-p-nitroanilide, is monitored<br>
spectrophotometrically in a chymotrypsin-coupled assay,<br>
which releases para-nitroanilide from the trans form of<br>
the substrate.. The inhibition of this reaction caused .<br>
by the addition of different concentrations of<br>
inhibitor is determined, and the data is analyzed as a<br>
change in first-order rate constant as a function of<br>
inhibitor conpentration to yield the apparent K^<br>
values.<br>
In a plastic cuvette are added 950 mL of ice cold<br>
assay buffer (25 mM HEPES, pH 7.8, 100 mM NaCl), 10 mL<br>
of FKBP (2.5 mM in 10 mM Tris-Cl pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 1<br>
mM dithiothreitol), 25 mL of chymotrypsin (50 mg/ml in<br>
1 mM HCl) and 10 mL of test compound at various<br>
concentrations in dimethyl sulfoxide. The reaction is<br>
initiated by the addition of 5 mL of substrate<br>
(succinyl-Ala-Phe-Pro-Phe-para-nitroanilide, 5 mg/mL in<br>
2.35 mM LiCl in trifluoroethanol).<br>
The absorbance at 390 nm versus time is monitored<br>
for 90 sec using a spectrophotometer and the rate<br>
constants are determined from the absorbance versus<br>
time data files.<br>

In mammalian cells, FKBP-12 complexes with the<br>
inositol triphosphate receptor (IP3R) and the ryanodine<br>
receptor (RyR). It is believed that the neurotrophic<br>
compounds of this invention disassociates FKBP-12 from<br>
these complexes causing the calcium channel to become<br>
"leaky" (Cameron et al., 1995). Calcium fluxes are<br>
involved in neurite extensions so that the IP3R<br>
receptor and the ryanodine receptor might be involved<br>
in the neurotrophic effects of drugs. Since the drugs<br>
bind to the same site as FKBP-12 as the IP3R receptor,<br>
one could assume that the drugs displace the channels<br>
from FKBP-12.<br>
Chick Dorsal Root Ganglion<br>
Cultures and Neurite Outgrowth<br>
Dorsal root ganglia were dissected from chick<br>
embryos of ten day gestation. Whole ganglion explants<br>
were cultured on thin layer Matrigel-coated 12 well<br>
plates with Liebovitz L15 plus high glucose media<br>
supplemented with 2mM glutamine and 10% fetal calf<br>
serum, and also containing 10 JJ.M. cytosine /3-D<br>
arabinofuranoside (Ara C) at 37°C in an environment<br>
containing 5% CO2. Twenty-four hours later, the DRGs<br>
were treated with various concentrations of nervegrowth<br>
factor, immunophilin ligands or combinations of<br>
NFG plus drugs. Forty-eight hours after drug<br>
treatment, the ganglia were visualized under phase<br>
contrast or Hoffman Modulation contrast with a Zeiss<br>
Axiovert inverted microscope. Photomicrographs of the<br>
explants were made, and neurite outgrowth was<br>
quantitated. Neurites longer than the DRG diameter<br>
were counted as positive, with total number of neurites<br>
quantitated per each experimental condition. Three to<br>
four DRGs are cultured-per well, and each treatment was<br>
performed in duplicate.<br>
The data for these experiments are presented in<br>
Table II. Representative photomicrographs for Example<br>
17 are shown in Figure 1; a dose response curve for<br>
this Example jla given in Figure 2 .•<br>

Sciatic Nerve Axotomy<br>
Six-week old male Sprague-Dawley rats were<br>
anesthetized, and the sciatic nerve exposed and<br>
crushed, at the level .of the hip, by forceps. Test<br>
compounds or vehicle were administered subcutaneously<br>
just prior to the lesion and daily for the following 18<br>
days. Sections of the sciatic nerve were stained with<br>
Holmes silver stain to quantify the number of axons,<br>
and Luxol fast blue to quantify the level of<br>
myelination. Eighteen days after lesion, there was a<br>
significant decrease in the number of axons (50%<br>
decrease as compared to non-lesioned control) and<br>
degree of myelination (90% decrease as compared to nonlesioned<br>
control) in animal treated with vehicle.<br>
Administration of Example 1 (30 mg/kg s.c.), just<br>
prior to the lesion and daily for 18 days following the<br>
lesion, resulted in significant regeneration of both<br>
7<br>
axon number (5% decrease as compared to non-lesioned<br>
control) and the degree of myelination (50% decrease as<br>
compared to control) as compared to vehicle treated<br>
animals. The significant efficacy of Example 1 is<br>
consistent with its potent activity in inhibiting<br>
rotamase activity and stimulating neurite outgrowth in<br>
chick DRGs. These results are shown in Figure 3. "Sham"<br>
denotes control animals that received vehicle but'were<br>
not lesioned; "Vehicle" denotes animals that were<br>
lesioned and received only vehicle (i.e., no drug).<br>
Example 1 showed a striking similarity to the sham<br>
treated animals, demonstrating the powerful<br>
neuroregenerative effects of these compounds in vivo.<br>
Inactive is a compound that is inactive as an FKBP12<br>
inhibitor. Animals treated with this compound resembled<br>
the vehicle-treated lesioned animals, consistent with<br>
the neuroregenerative results observed with Example 1<br>
being directly caused by its inhibition of FKBP12.<br>
Quantitation for these data are shown in Table III.<br>

MPTP Model of Parkinson's Disease in Mice<br>
MPTP lesioning of dopaminergic neurons in mice was<br>
used as an animal model of Parkinson's Disease. Four<br>
week old male GDI white mice were dosed i.p. with 30<br>
mg/kg of MPTP for 5 days. Example 17(10-40 mg/kg), or<br>
vehicle, were administered s.c. along with the MPTP for<br>
5 days, as well as for an additional 5 days following<br>
cessation of MPTP treatment. At 18 days following MPTP<br>
4<br>
treatment, the animals were sacrificed and the striata<br>
were dissected and homogenized. Binding of [3HJCFT, a<br>
radioligand for the dopamine transporter, to the<br>
stiatal membranes was done to quantitate the level of<br>
the dopamine transporter (DAT) following lesion and<br>
drug treatment. Immunostaining was performed on<br>
saggital and coronal brain sections using anti-tyrosine<br>
hydoxylase Ig to quantitate survival and recovery of<br>
dopaminergic neurons. In animals treated with MPTP and<br>
vehicle, a substantial loss of functional dopaminergic<br>
terminals was observed as compared to non-lesioned<br>
animals. Lesioned animals receiving Example 17 showed a<br>
nearly quantitative recovery of TH-stained dopaminergic<br>
neurons.<br>
Figures 4 and 5 show the quantitation in DAT<br>
levels, whereas* figures 6-8 are photomicrographs<br>
showing the regenerative effects of Example 17 in this<br>
model. Figure 4 demonstrates the significant recovery<br>
in functional dopaminergic terminals, as assayed by<br>
[3H]-CFT binding, relative to animals receiving MPTP<br>
but not the Guilford compounds. Figure 5 gives this<br>
data in bar graph form. It is shown that animals<br>
receiving 40 mg/kg of Example 17 in addition to MPTP<br>
manifested a greater than 90% recovery of [3H]-CFT<br>
binding. As shown in Figures 6-8, immunostaining for<br>
tyrosine hydroxylase (a marker of viable dopaminergic<br>
neurons) in the striatum, the nigra, and the medial<br>
forebrain bundle, shows a clear and marked recovery of<br>
t<br>
functional neurons in animals that received Example 17,<br>
as compared to animals that received lesioning agent<br>
but no drug (MPTP/Vehicle).<br>

The requisite substituted alcohols may be prepared<br>
by a number of methods known to those skilled in the<br>
art of organic .synthesis.. As described in Scheme II,<br>
alkyl or aryl.aldehydes may be homologated to phenyl<br>
propanols by reaction with methyl<br>
(triphenylphosphoranylidene)acetate to provide a<br>
variety of trans-cinnamates; these latter may be<br>
reduced to the saturated alcohols by reaction with<br>
excess lithium aluminum hydride, or sequentially by<br>
reduction of the double bond by catalytic hydrogenation<br>
and reduction of the saturated ester by appropriate<br>
reducing agents. Alternatively, the trans-cinnamates<br>
may be reduced to (E)-allylic alcohols by the use of<br>
diisobutylaluminum hydride.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Longer chain alcohols may be prepared by<br>
homologation of benzylic and higher aldehydes.<br>
Alternatively, these aldehydes may be prepared by<br>
conversion of the corresponding phenylacetic' and higher<br>
acids, and phenethyl and higher alcohols.<br>
General procedure for the synthesis of acrylic<br>
esters, exemplified for methyl (3,3,5-trimethoxy)-<br>

25.48 mmol) and- methyl (triphenyl--<br>
phosphoranylidene)acetate (10.0 g; 29.91 mmol) in<br>
tetrahydrofuran (250 mL) was refluxed overnight. After<br>
cooling, the reaction mixture was diluted with 200 mL<br>
of ethyl acetate and washed with 2 x 200 mL of water,<br>
dried, and concentrated in vacuo. The crude residue was<br>
chromatographed on a silica gel column, eluting with<br>
25% ethyl acetate in hexane, to obtain 5.63 g (88%) of<br>
the cinnamate as a white crystalline solid, 1H NMR (300<br>

mL) was added in a dropwise manner to a solution of<br>
lithium aluminum hydride (14 mmol) in THF (35 mL), with<br>
stirring and under an argon atmosphere. After the<br>

addition was complete, the mixture was heated to 75°C<br>
for 4 hours. After cooling, it was quenched by the<br>
careful addition of 15 mL of 2N NaOH followed by 50 mL<br>
of water. The resulting mixture was filtered through<br>
Celite to remove solids, and the filter cake was washed<br>
with ethyl acetate. The combined organic fractions were<br>
washed with water, dried, concentrated in vacuo, and<br>
purified on a silica gel column, eluting with ethyl<br>
acetate to obtain 0.86 g (53%) of the alcohol as a<br>
