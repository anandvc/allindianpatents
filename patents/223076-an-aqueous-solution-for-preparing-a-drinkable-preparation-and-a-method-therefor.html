				<td>AN AQUEOUS SOLUTION FOR PREPARING A DRINKABLE<br>
PREPARATION AND A METHOD THEREFOR<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention concerns an oral simultaneous treatment for conditions<br>
causing fever, inflammation and/or pain in a herd of animals using a drink<br>
preparation comprising drinking water for animals or artificial milk for lactating<br>
animals, supplemented with ketoprofen, for being simultaneously ingested by a<br>
herd of animals.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Ketoprofen [2-(3-benzoylphenyl)propionic acid] is an active ingredient<br>
that inhibits cyclooxygenase with analgesic, antiinflammatory and antipyretic<br>
properties.<br>
The use of ketoprofen (racemic) has been described in veterinary<br>
applications and a number of veterinary products contain ketoprofen either as<br>
tablets for oral administration for dogs or as an injectable solution for cattle, pigs<br>
and horses. Both these preparations are for strictly individual use and animals<br>
must be treated one by one both when reared individually and also when reared<br>
in herds (farms).<br>
In modern intensive farming, non-dairy livestock, for example pigs, beef<br>
cattle, etc. are reared in large herds that can hold up to thousands of animals. In<br>
these farms, the animal population density is very high and when a focus of<br>
infection appears this rapidly spreads to the whole herd (or at least the whole<br>
stockyard), especially in the case of respiratory infections. In these cases, the<br>
whole herd should be treated simultaneously. If these are treated with the<br>
ketoprofen products currently available on the market, each individual animal<br>
must be held still and administered the appropriate dose of the medicine and<br>
the whole process repeated for several days. This is very time-consuming and<br>
requires considerable manual work, increasing greatly the cost of the treatment,<br>
which must be added to the cost of the antibiotic treatment administered<br>
simultaneously, and causing animal stress that greatly worsens the course of<br>
the illness, making this type of treatment unviable in practise.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention concerns a solution for the problem of developing a system<br>
to simultaneously treat a herd of animals for conditions that cause fever,<br>
inflammation and/or pain.<br>
The solution provided by the invention is based on the inventor's<br>
observation that by adding an aqueous solution of ketoprofen to a herd's<br>
drinking water or to the artificial milk for lactating animals in an appropriate<br>
amount relative to animal's bodyweight and the number of animals present, a<br>
herd of animals can be easily treated simultaneously.<br>
A method such as that provided by this invention is advantageous<br>
because individual animals do not have to be held still to administer them the<br>
treatment, avoiding delays in administering the product and reducing manual<br>
labor costs and stress to animals.<br>
One object of this invention is a drink preparation comprising the animal<br>
drinking water or artificial milk for lactating animals supplemented with<br>
ketoprofen.<br>
Another additional object of this invention is a method for obtaining said<br>
drink preparation comprising ketoprofen.<br>
Another additional object of this invention is the use of an aqueous<br>
solution of ketoprofen for the obtention of this drink preparation comprising<br>
ketoprofen for the simultaneous oral treatment of conditions causing fever,<br>
inflammation and/or pain, in a herd of animals.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention concerns a drink preparation comprising animal drinking<br>
water or artificial milk for lactating animals supplemented with ketoprofen.<br>
The drink preparation comprising ketoprofen provided by this invention,<br>
hereinafter referred as the drink preparation of the invention, is a preparation<br>
that can be drunk by animals.<br>
The drinking water for animals and artificial milk for lactating animals are<br>
known products. For the practical application of this invention, any animal<br>
drinking water or artificial milk for lactating animals can be used.<br>
Ketoprofen is a commercially available product useful as an analgesic,<br>
antiinflammatory and/or antipyretic agent. Alternatively, it can be obtained by a<br>
method such as that described in the American patent US 3,641,127. In the<br>
drink preparation of the invention, ketoprofen is dissolved. Since the drink<br>
preparation of the invention is designed to treat a herd of animals, the amount<br>
of ketoprofen contained in said drink preparation can vary within a wide interval.<br>
In general, the drink preparation of the invention contains ketoprofen in an<br>
amount sufficient to provide a therapeutically effective amount to the animal that<br>
ingests this drink preparation. As used in this specification, the term<br>
"therapeutically effective amount" refers to an amount sufficient to have a<br>
therapeutic effect on the animal, for example, an amount ranging from 1 to 5 mg<br>
of ketoprofen per kg in weight of the live animal that ingests this drink<br>
preparation per day (1-5 mg/kg/day). In one specific application, the drink<br>
preparation of the invention contains ketoprofen in an amount sufficient to<br>
supply 3 mg/kg/day of ketoprofen to the animal that ingests this drink<br>
preparation.<br>
The drink preparation of the invention can be used for the oral treatment<br>
of conditions causing fever, inflammation and/or pain, in a herd of animals<br>
simultaneously. In the sense used in this specification, the term "conditions that<br>
cause fever, inflammation and/or pain" can correspond to any alteration or<br>
illness, of infectious origin or not, in which all or some of these symptoms are<br>
present. Also, the term "herd of animals" refers to a group of animals, such as,<br>
for example the group of animals present in an intensive cattle farm and the<br>
term "simultaneously" refers to the fact that the herd of animals receives the<br>
ketoprofen treatment at the same time, regardless of whether all the animals<br>
ingest the drink preparation of the invention at the same time, since the<br>
ketoprofen is incorporated in the drinking water or in the artificial milk for<br>
lactating animals.<br>
Examples 2 and 3 demonstrate the clinical efficacy of a drink preparation<br>
of the invention as a coadjuvant treatment to the antibiotic treatment of Bovine<br>
Respiratory Disease (BRD) in herds of calves or lactating calves. Example 4<br>
illustrates the clinical efficacy of a drink preparation of the invention as a<br>
coadjuvant treatment to the antibiotic treatment of Porcine Respiratory Disease<br>
Complex (PRDC) in herds of fattening pigs.<br>
The drink preparation of the invention can be obtained by a method that<br>
involves mixing an aqueous solution of ketoprofen with animal drinking water or<br>
artificial milk for lactating animals. The amount of aqueous solution of<br>
ketoprofen mixed with the drinking water or with the artificial milk can vary within<br>
a wide interval. The ratio between (i) the aqueous solution of ketoprofen and (ii)<br>
the drinking water or artificial milk depends on several factors, including the<br>
concentration of ketoprofen in the aqueous solution of ketoprofen, the amount<br>
of drinking water or artificial milk drank by the animals and the dose of<br>
ketoprofen to be administered to each animal. The amount of water or artificial<br>
water drank by the animal is a very variable factor and depends, among other<br>
factors, on the animal's weight, the climatic conditions and the animals clinical<br>
condition. As an example, a 3% aqueous solution of ketoprofen can be added<br>
to the drinking water for animals in an amount ranging from 0.5 to 2 millilitres of<br>
this aqueous solution of ketoprofen per litre of drinking water or in an amount of<br>
between 1.5 and 7.0 millilitres of this aqueous solution of ketoprofen per litre of<br>
artificial milk for lactating animals.<br>
The concentration of ketoprofen in this aqueous solution can vary within<br>
a wide interval. The lower limit is determined by the minimum amount of<br>
ketoprofen that it is practical to add to the preparation of this aqueous solution<br>
of ketoprofen with this intended use. The upper limit is determined, among other<br>
factors, by the concentration of ketoprofen in the aqueous solution, at a specific<br>
pH, at which this begins to precipitate. As an example, the concentration of<br>
ketoprofen in the aqueous solution can range from 1% to 15% (w/v), normally<br>
between 1% and 5% (w/v). In a particular embodiment, the concentration of<br>
ketoprofen in the aqueous solution is 3% (w/v).<br>
Ketoprofen is almost insoluble in water and several methods can be<br>
followed to prepare the aqueous solution. One of these consists in using a co-<br>
solvent, for example, polyethylene glycol 400,1-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, etc., and<br>
another strategy consists in increasing the solubility of ketoprofen by the<br>
formation of salts in situ with a basic amino acid, for example lysine, arginine,<br>
etc.<br>
In a particular embodiment, the cosolvent used to prepare the aqueous<br>
solution of ketoprofen is 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidone.<br>
In another particular embodiment, the aqueous solution of ketoprofen<br>
includes L-arginine in order to increase the solubility of ketoprofen in water by<br>
forming in situ the corresponding salt with L-arginine. The concentration of L-<br>
arginine is established by adjusting the equimolecular amount of this substance<br>
required to solubilise ketoprofen, as well as an additional amount in order to<br>
favour the use regimes of the aqueous solution of ketoprofen for different<br>
qualities of drinking water or types of artificial milk. The concentration of L-<br>
arginine in the aqueous solution can vary within a wide interval depending on<br>
the concentration of ketoprofen. As an example, the concentration of L-arginine<br>
in the aqueous solution can range from 2% to 30% (w/v), usually between 2%<br>
and 8% (w/v). In a particular embodiment, the concentration of L-arginine in the<br>
aqueous solution is 5.5% (w/v).<br>
The aqueous solution of ketoprofen can also contain one or more<br>
veterinary acceptable additives such as humectants, pH modifiers,<br>
preservatives, etc.<br>
As a humectant, any compound that promotes the dissolution of<br>
ketoprofen in aqueous solution can be used, for example polysorbates,<br>
poloxamers, such as poloxamer 407, etc.<br>
It is known (Index Merck, Analytical Profiles of Drug Substances), that<br>
the pKa of ketoprofen in acetonitrile/water (3/1) ranges from 5.02 to 5.94 in<br>
methanol/water (3/1), being the mean value of about 5.5, while for arginine the<br>
pK1 is 2.18 (carboxylic) and the pK2 is 9.09 (amino), being the mean value of<br>
about 5.6, and after a pH equal to or higher than 5.5, both compounds are<br>
sufficiently ionized (dissociated) to interact and to keep ketoprofen in solution.<br>
With this purpose, when making up the aqueous solution, the pH was adjusted<br>
from 5.5 to 7.0, by adding a pH modifier agent. Experiments carried out showed<br>
that ketoprofen precipitated at a pH lower than 5.5.<br>
Therefore, the pH modifier is a compound, acidic or basic, that provides<br>
the aqueous ketoprofen solution with such a pH value that the ketoprofen<br>
remains in an ionised form, for example a pH between 5.5 and 7.0, preferably of<br>
6.5. In a particular embodiment, when the aqueous ketoprofen solution contains<br>
1-methyl-2-pyrrolidone as a cosolvent, the pH modifier agent is an inorganic<br>
base, for example, sodium hydroxide, in the amount required (q.s.) to provide<br>
the aqueous solution with a pH of 6.5. In another particular embodiment, when<br>
the aqueous solution of ketoprofen contains a basic amino acid, for example, L-<br>
arginine, the pH modifier agent is an acid such as citric, maleic, hydrochloric<br>
acid etc. in the required (q.s.) to provide the aqueous solution of ketoprofen with<br>
a pH of between 5.5 and 7.0.<br>
The results of the stability studies of the ketoprofen aqueous solution in<br>
relation to the solution appearance, as a consequence of the small variation in<br>
pH value (a key factor for this use), demonstrate that the goal to maintain<br>
ketoprofen in solution is achieved perfectly. The remaining results confirm the<br>
success of the formulation.<br>
After diluting the aqueous solution of ketoprofen with animal drinking<br>
water or artificial milk for lactating animals, in order to obtain the drink<br>
preparation of this invention, solubilization of ketoprofen is aided by diluting the<br>
product. Therefore, even in relatively acidic waters (around pH 5.0), the drink<br>
preparation of the invention has been observed to remain stable and any<br>
precipitate forms even after 48 hours in refrigeration. It has also been shown<br>
that the pH is not modified when the aqueous solution of ketoprofen is added to<br>
the drinking water according to the proposed used and that the chemical data<br>
remain unaltered after 72 hours, using the sample directly without any additional<br>
treatment, as demonstrated by the results of the stability tests.<br>
Favourably, the aqueous ketoprofen solution includes a preservative in<br>
order to ensure its preservation during the proposed use. As a preservative, any<br>
agent that ensures the conservation of the aqueous ketoprofen solution or the<br>
drink preparation of the invention can be used such as benzylic alcohol,<br>
parabenes etc. In a particular embodiment, benzylic alcohol is used, an<br>
antimicrobial preservative used in cosmetics, food and a wide range of<br>
pharmaceutical formulae including oral and parenteral preparations, at a<br>
concentration ranging from 0.5% to 3%, for example between 0.5% and 2.5%.<br>
Benzylic alcohol is a product included in the Handbook of Inactive Ingredients of<br>
the FDA (injectables, capsules, solutions and oral tablets, and topical and<br>
vaginal preparations), and also present in parenteral and non parenteral<br>
products sold in Great Britain (Handbook of Pharmaceutical Excipients, 3rd<br>
edition , page 42).<br>
The aqueous solution of ketoprofen can be obtained by mixing its<br>
components in appropriate amounts. In a particular embodiment, this aqueous<br>
solution of ketoprofen has the following composition:<br>
Ingredient<br>
Ketoprofen 1-15% (w/v)<br>
L-Arginine 2-30% (w/v)<br>
Benzylic alcohol 0.5-3%<br>
Anhydrous citric acid (q.s.) pH between 5.5 and 7.0<br>
Purified water q.s. 100%<br>
In another particular embodiment, this aqueous solution of ketoprofen<br>
has the following composition:<br>
Ingredient<br>
Ketoprofen 1-5% (w/v)<br>
L-Arginine 2-8% (w/v)<br>
Benzylic alcohol 0.5-2.5%<br>
Anhydrous citric acid q.s. pH between 6.0 and 7.0<br>
Purified water q.s. 100%<br>
The following examples serve to illustrate the invention and should by no<br>
means be considered to limit its scope of application.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
Preparation of an aqueous solution of ketoprofen<br>
Since ketoprofen is almost insoluble in water, several experiments were<br>
carried out in an attempt to resolve this problem.<br>
Therefore, in the first place, preliminary experiments were carried out to<br>
establish the proportion of cosolvent or basic amino acid required to dissolve 1<br>
g of ketoprofen in an aqueous medium and then the samples were subjected to<br>
forced conditions (5 °C and -20 °C). As a co-solvent, polyethylene glycol 400<br>
and 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidone were tested and L-arginine and L-lysine as basic<br>
amino acids. From these preliminary tests, 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidone was selected<br>
as a co-solvent since ketoprofen is more soluble in this cosolvent than with<br>
polyethylene glycol 400, and L-arginine as the amino acid.<br>
Then, further experiments were carried out using the co-solvent and<br>
basic amino acid chosen and the possibility of adding a humectant agent<br>
(poloxamere 407) was considered to favour ketoprofen solubilization. Therefore,<br>
the preformulation step was started by preparing the centesimal compositions<br>
recorded in Table 1.<br>
The pH was adjusted to 6.5 and it was demonstrated that the<br>
compositions based on the formation of salts in situ, are pH dependent and for<br>
pH values lower than 5.5, obtained by adding diluted hydrochloric acid,<br>
precipitation of ketoprofen occurred.<br>
Of the compositions tested, the one identified as composition n. 2 did not<br>
have a good solubility and those containing poloxamere 407 (compositions n. 4,<br>
5 and 6) had a tendency to produce foam since this compound is a non ionic<br>
surfactant. Due to the high contents (60%) of co-solvent in composition n. 1,<br>
composition n. 3 was chosen for the following experiments.<br>
In another group of experiments, it was decided to adjust the amount of<br>
L-arginine required to solubilise ketoprofen, to test different preservative agents<br>
and, finally, to carry out the appropriate modifications by adding L-arginine, for<br>
the solution to be highly compatible with the different water qualities to be<br>
treated. The preservative chosen was benzylic alcohol. Taking into account all<br>
these considerations the composition described below was obtained,<br>
hereinafter referred as "EV solution", that is used in the experiments described<br>
in Examples 2,3 and 4.<br>
Composition of a 3% aqueous solution of ketoprofen<br>
(EV solution)<br>
Ingredient<br>
Ketoprofen 3.000 g<br>
L-Arginine 5.500 g<br>
Benzylic alcohol 2.000 g<br>
Anhydrous citric acid q.s. pH 6.5<br>
Purified water q.s. 100 ml<br>
After, a pilot batch was made with the EV solution and using this batch<br>
the stability at 0.1% (v/v) was verified in drinking water (tap water and purified<br>
water) for animals and in artificial milk for lactating animals, in order to be able<br>
to recommend a maximum using term. The results obtained give a using term of<br>
72 hours for the drinking water containing 0.1% of the aqueous solution of<br>
ketoprofen and 24 hours of using term for the artificial milk for lactating animals<br>
containing 0.1% of this aqueous solution of ketoprofen.<br>
STUDY OF THE CLINICAL EFFICACY OF AN AQUEOUS SOLUTION OF<br>
KETOPROFEN, ADMINISTERED ORALLY IN DRINKING WATER, AS A<br>
COMPLEMENT TO THE ANTIBIOTIC TREATMENT OF RESPIRATORY<br>
DISEASE IN CALVES<br>
Most infectious processes are known to cause important inflammation of<br>
soft tissues often associated with pain. They are also usually associated with<br>
release of endotoxins that cause, among other phenomena, a febrile condition.<br>
Together, these phenomena all worsen the animal's clinical condition and<br>
prolong the course of the illness [Laval, A. (1992). Utilisation des anti-<br>
inflammatoires chez le pore. Rec. Méd. Vét. 168(8/9):733-744]. Because of this,<br>
elimination of these symptoms by administering non steroid antiinflammatory<br>
agents (NSAIDs) as a complement to antibacterial therapy has been described<br>
as a very beneficial process in veterinary medicine [Kopcha, M. et al. (1989).<br>
Experimental uses of flunixin meglumine and phenylbutazone in food-producing<br>
animals. JAVMA 194(1):45-49].<br>
One of the applications of this therapeutic approach is the treatment of<br>
Bovine Respiratory Disease (BRD), a pathological complex in whose<br>
etiopathogeny different etiological agents, especially Pasteurella multocida and<br>
Mycoplasma spp. [Merck Veterinary Manual (1998), 8th ed. Merck &amp; Co., Inc.,<br>
Whitehouse Station, NJ, USA, p. 2188] have been implicated. More specifically,<br>
it has been demonstrated that the use of selected NSAIDs, including<br>
ketoprofen, complementary to the antibacterial treatment of this disease<br>
increases the recovery rate of the animals and the percentage of clinical<br>
improvement at the end of treatment [Deleforge, J. et al. (1994). A field<br>
evaluation of the efficacy of tolfenamic acid and oxytetracycline in the treatment<br>
of bovine respiratory disease. J. Vet. Pharmacol. Therap. 17:43-47; Balmer,<br>
T.V. et al., (1997). Comparison of Carprofen and Flunixin Meglumine as<br>
adjunctive therapy in Bovine Respiratory Disease. The Veterinary Journal<br>
154:233-241; Lockwood, P. et al. (1998). Eficacia clinica comparada de tres<br>
antiinflamatorios no esteroideos (NSAID), flunixin meglumine, carprofeno y<br>
ketoprofeno como complemento del tratamiento antibacteriano de la<br>
enfermedad respiratoria bovina. Albeitar 16:15]. However, in most published<br>
studies that describe this therapeutic practise, the administration of NSAID has<br>
been done parenterally (intramuscular or intravenous), and few studies have<br>
used the oral route for this purpose.<br>
In order to assess the clinical efficacy of the EV solution, a 3% aqueous<br>
solution of ketoprofen (Example 1) was orally administered in the drinking water<br>
of beef calf herds as a coadjuvant treatment to antibacterial treatment of Bovine<br>
Respiratory Disease (BRD) and a clinical trial was conducted following the<br>
principles of good clinical practise.<br>
For this purpose, this clinical study was designed and carried out as a<br>
controlled multicentric clinical trial [the animals included in the study were<br>
distributed into two groups, one of which received a treatment based on<br>
Antibiotics + EV solution while the other received a treatment based on<br>
Antibiotic + Placebo (excipient of EV solution) acting, therefore, as a negative<br>
control]. The trial was randomized and blind.<br>
1. MATERIAL AND METHODS<br>
1.1 ANIMALS<br>
In accordance with the required sample size, a total of 350 young grazing<br>
beef cattle in the fattening stage were included (175 in each treatment group).<br>
At the time of inclusion, all the calves presented a clinical picture of moderate or<br>
severe BRD. During the study, the animals were housed in an out-building and<br>
allocated to one of two stockyards (one for each treatment group). All the<br>
animals received commercial standard feed without medicinal additives and<br>
drinking water ad libitum from automatic drinking devices.<br>
1.2 EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN<br>
The experimental period lasted a total of 10 days. Selection of animals<br>
was done on the first day of the experimental period (day D1). After detecting<br>
an outbreak of BRD in a beef calf fattening farm, animals fulfilling the following<br>
selection criteria were selected:<br>
1°. With a clinical symptomatology compatible with BRD, with a severity<br>
higher than 1.1 (&gt;1.1: moderate or severe disease) on the clinical score scale<br>
created ad hoc for the study; and<br>
2°. They had not received antibacterial or antiinflammatory agents in the<br>
seven days before the selection.<br>
After selecting a batch, the animals were distributed into two<br>
homogeneous equally sized groups. Then, each of the groups was placed in a<br>
different stockyard and by a simple randomized technique, one group was<br>
assigned to treatment A (Antibiotic + EV solution) and the other group to<br>
treatment B (Antibiotic + Placebo).<br>
The treatment period lasted a total of 3 days for all animals (days D1 to<br>
D3) and treatment consisted in administering two products to each group; an<br>
Antibiotic, the same for both groups, on days D1 and D3, and the EV solution<br>
(Group A) or its excipient (Group B), on days D1, D2 and D3 (see Figure 1).<br>
Figure 1 shows a diagrammatic representation of the experimental<br>
design of the clinical efficacy study of a 3% aqueous solution of ketoprofen<br>
used complementarily to antibacterial treatment of BRD in calves.<br>
From the first day (day D1) until the last day of treatment (day D4) the<br>
clinical status of the animals was monitored (Figure 1). During this period, the<br>
following operations were carried out:<br>
Measurement of the Clinical Index or severity of the disease: days<br>
D1 to D4<br>
Measurement of the body temperature: days D1 to D4<br>
Measurement of the body weight: days D1, D4 and D10<br>
Monitoring for possible relapse: days D4-D10<br>
Measurement of the Clinical Index or severity of the disease<br>
This index was calculated individually for each animal, once a day from<br>
days D1 to D4, using a score scale based on one used previously by other<br>
authors [Raynaud, J.P., et al. (1986). Examen clinique standarise dans les<br>
broncho-pneumonies infectieuses enzootiques des bovins et essais de<br>
medicaments-methodologie et interpretation statistique. Proceedings of XlVth<br>
World Congress on Cattle Diseases. Dublin 26-29 August pp 435-439;<br>
Deleforge(1992) supra].<br>
According to the scoring systems described by the previously mentioned<br>
authors, a Clinical Index (Cl) higher than 1.1 is equivalent to a moderate or<br>
severe disease status. On the other hand, a Cl equal to or lower than 1.1 is<br>
equivalent to no disease or an imperceptible disease status:<br>
Cl = 1.1 } No or imperceptible disease<br>
1.1 
Cl = 2 } Severe disease status<br>
This parameter was used to study the main variable of this study,<br>
"CLINICAL EFFICACY" at the end of treatment (day D4), on a dual scale with<br>
the categories:<br>
POSITIVE EVALUATION = Success of treatment (Cl = 1.1), and<br>
NEGATIVE EVALUATION = Failure of treatment (Cl &gt; 1.1).<br>
Measurement of body temperature<br>
This parameter was measured daily for each animal in the morning on<br>
days D1 to D4. This parameter corresponds to one of the secondary variables<br>
of the study.<br>
Measurement of animal weight<br>
The weight of each of the animals was recorded on days D1 (baseline),<br>
D4 and D10, using balances specially designed to weigh large animals<br>
(EziWeight-1 / TRU-TEST®),<br>
Monitoring for possible relapse<br>
Finally, over the 7 days after the end of the treatment period (days D4 to<br>
D10), the possible appearance of relapses was controlled (Figure 1).<br>

1.3.2 Dose, therapeutic regime and route of administration<br>
1.3.2.1 Antibiotic<br>
The antibiotic preparation was administered to both groups (A and B) in<br>
the dose recommended by the manufacturer by intramuscular injection in the<br>
neck muscle. The treatment consisted of 2 doses administered with an interval<br>
of 48 hours (days D1 and D3).<br>
1.3.2.2 Products studied<br>
Animals from Group A received a mean dose of 1 ml of solution EV /10<br>
kg of live weight (equivalent to 3 mg ketoprofen / kg / day). Animals from Group<br>
B received a mean dose of 1 ml of Placebo /10 kg / day. Both products were<br>
administered orally in the drinking water, daily for three consecutive days (days<br>
D1, D2 and D3).<br>
1.4 STATISTICAL PROCEDURES<br>
Mean values and profiles of clinical index, temperature and weight in both<br>
groups were compared by the Student's t-test and when criteria of normality<br>
were not reached the Mann-Whitney Test was applied.<br>
The main study variable, "Treatment efficacy", was studied by comparing<br>
the percentages of treatments that had been evaluated positively (success) and<br>
those evaluated negatively (failures) in each of the treatment groups, using<br>
Pearson's Chi-squared statistical test.<br>
2. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION<br>
In spite of the fact that the mean basal value of the clinical index was<br>
very similar in both groups, during the control carried out on the second day of<br>
treatment (D2) this value was significantly lower in Group A (treated with EV<br>
solution) than in group B (treated with Placebo), and remained like this until the<br>
end of the treatment (Table 2). On the other hand, while Group A by the second<br>
day of treatment (day D2) had reached a mean clinical index lower than or<br>
equal to 1.1 (equivalent to a low or imperceptible disease status), in Group B<br>
NS = No statistically significant difference between the two groups (p&gt;0.05).<br>
These results indicate that the symptoms of the disease disappear first in<br>
animals from Group A than in animals from Group B, which, according to the<br>
mean value of the clinical index on day 4, had not been completely cured by this<br>
time (Figure 2).<br>
According to the protocol, using the clinical index presented by each<br>
animal in the control group on day D4, the clinical researcher evaluated the<br>
efficacy of each treatment (main variable), only considering those in which the<br>
clinical index had decreased to a value lower than or equal to 1.1 (low or<br>
imperceptible disease status) as being successfully treated. The results of this<br>
evaluation are recorded in detail in Table 3.<br>
As reflected in Table 3, the percentage of animals in which the treatment<br>
was successful was significantly higher in the group treated with EV solution<br>
than in the Group treated with Placebo. The difference between these<br>
percentages was 12%, a figure of considerable clinical relevance if we consider<br>
that the success percentage predicted for the Placebo group was around 85%,<br>
as indeed occurred.<br>
According to the results, administration of the EV solution in the drinking<br>
water as a coadjuvant treatment for the antibacterial therapy of BRD has a<br>
beneficial therapeutic effect compared to the treatment of this disease with<br>
antibiotics alone.<br>
As can be observed in Table 4 and in Figure 3, in spite of a very similar<br>
mean basal temperature in both Groups, on the second day of treatment this<br>
value was significantly lower in Group A than in Group B, and remained lower<br>
until the end of treatment.<br>
NS = No statistical significance between the two groups (p&gt;0.05).<br>
As can be observed in Figure 3, the drop in temperature in Group A was<br>
considerable and mainly occurred on the first day of treatment. In contrast, in<br>
Group B this temperature drop was not as pronounced as that of Group A and<br>
took place more gradually over the three days of treatment.<br>
The gradual drop in temperature experienced by Group B in spite of<br>
these receiving Placebo can be explained by the therapeutic effect of the<br>
antibacterial agent which, by reducing the bacterial load, also reduces the<br>
pyretic reaction triggered by the organism as a response to the infection.<br>
Over the 10 days at the end of the treatment, clinical symptoms of BRD<br>
did not reappear in any of the animals from either treatment group in which the<br>
treatment had been assessed as successful by the researcher.<br>
3. CONCLUSIONS<br>
From the results obtained in this study, it can be concluded that oral<br>
administration of the EV solution in the drinking water, at a dose of 1 ml /10 kg<br>
of live weight (equivalent to 3 mg/ kg of its active ingredient, ketoprofen) on<br>
three consecutive days, administered complementarity to antibacterial treatment<br>
for Bovine Respiratory Disease (BRD), rapidly reduces the clinical symptoms<br>
and the percentage of animals cured at the end of the treatment was<br>
significantly higher than those obtained when only the antibacterial agent was<br>
administered.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
STUDY OF THE CLINICAL EFFICACY OF AN AQUEOUS SOLUTION OF<br>
KETOPROFEN, ADMINISTERED ORALLY IN ARTIFICIAL MILK FOR<br>
LACTATING ANIMALS AS A COMPLEMENT TO ANTIBACTERIAL<br>
TREATMENT FOR BOVINE RESPIRATORY DISEASE IN LACTATING<br>
CALVES<br>
This clinical study was carried out to assess the clinical efficacy of the EV<br>
solution, a 3% aqueous solution of ketoprofen (Example 1), after its oral<br>
administration in artificial milk for lactating animals (milk substitute), as<br>
coadjuvant treatment to antibacterial treatment for Bovine Respiratory Disease<br>
(BRD) in lactating calf herds.<br>
For this purpose, a controlled multicentric study was used [animals<br>
included in the study were distributed into two groups, one received treatment<br>
based on Antibiotics + EV solution while the other received a treatment based<br>
on Antibiotic + Placebo (Excipient of the EV solution) acting, therefore, as a<br>
negative control], ramdomized and blind, in compliance with the principles of<br>
Good Clinical Practise.<br>
1. MATERIAL AND METHODS<br>
1.1 ANIMALS<br>
A total of 188 lactating calves of different breeds and sex were included<br>
in the study. According to the selection criteria, at the time of inclusion in the<br>
study all the calves presented a clinical picture compatible with moderate or<br>
severe BRD.<br>
1.2 EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN<br>
The experimental design for this trial was the same as that described in<br>
Example 2, section 1.2.<br>
1.3 TREATMENTS<br>
1.3.1 Products' characteristics<br>
Both the antibiotic, NUFLOR® (Florfenicol) and the products studied (EV<br>
solution and Placebo) were the same as those used in the study described in<br>
Example 2, the characteristics of which are described in section 1.3.1 of<br>
Example 2. The EV solution and the Placebo were prepared with an identical<br>
appearance to ensure the blind character of the study.<br>
1.3.2 Dose, therapeutic regime and route of administration<br>
1.3.2.1 Antibiotic<br>
According to the established protocol the antibiotic preparation was<br>
administered to all the animals (groups A and B) according to the dose<br>
recommended by the manufacturer by intramuscular injection into the neck<br>
muscle. The treatment consisted of 2 doses administered with an interval of 48<br>
h (days D1 and D3).<br>
1.3.2.2 Products studied<br>
In addition to antibiotics, animals in Group A also received a mean dose<br>
of 1 ml EV solution /10 kg live weight (equivalent to 3 mg ketoprofen / kg / day)<br>
and the animals from Group B a mean dose of 1 ml of Placebo /10 kg / day.<br>
Both products were administered orally mixed in the milk substitute, daily for<br>
three consecutive days (D1, D2 and D3).<br>
1.4 STATISTICAL PROCEDURES<br>
The same statistical procedures were followed as those described in<br>
Example 2, described in section 1.4.<br>
2. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION<br>
In spite of the fact that the mean basal value of the clinical index<br>
calculated from the previously described parameters was almost identical in<br>
both groups, during the control carried out on the second treatment day this<br>
value was significantly lower in Group A (treated with EV solution) than in group<br>
B (treated with Placebo), remaining this way until the end of treatment (Table 5).<br>
NS = No statistically significant differences between the two groups (p&gt;0.05)<br>
On the other hand, while group A on the third treatment day (D3) reached<br>
a mean clinical index lower than 1.1 (equivalent to a low or imperceptible<br>
disease status) in Group B this index was still higher than this value by day D4<br>
(Table 5, Figure 4).<br>
These results indicate that the symptoms of the disease disappear earlier<br>
in animals from Group A than in animals from Group B. Nevertheless, at the<br>
end of the treatment (day D4) almost all animals in both the groups had been<br>
cured (Figure 4).<br>
As can be observed in Table 6 and in Figure 5, in spite of the fact that the<br>
mean basal temperature was very similar in both groups, on the second day of<br>
treatment this was significantly lower in Group A than in Group B and remained<br>
this way until the end of the treatment.<br>
NS = No statistically significant differences between the two groups (p&gt;0.05)<br>
As can be observed in Figure 5, there was a considerable drop in<br>
temperature in Group A mainly on the first day of treatment.<br>
The gradual temperature drop in group B in spite of these having<br>
received Placebo can be explained by the therapeutic effect of the antibacterial<br>
agent which reduces the bacterial load that, in turn, reduces the pyretic reaction<br>
triggered as a response to infection in the organism.<br>
From Table 7, it can be observed that there are no significant differences<br>
in the mean weight presented by both groups of animals on day D4. However,<br>
on day D10 animals from Group A presented a significantly higher mean weight<br>
than animals from Group B, indicating a greater improvement in clinical status in<br>
animals treated with the EV solution. On the other hand, the mean value of the<br>
weight increase (calculated from the weight difference between Day 10 and Day<br>
1) in Group A (8.55 ±1.18 kg), was also significantly higher (p
of group B (7.50 ± 1.40 kg).<br>
NS = No statistically significant differences between the two groups (p&gt;0.05)<br>
In the 10 days after the end of the treatment, clinical symptoms of BRD<br>
did not reappear in any of the animals from either group in which the treatment<br>
had been considered as successful by the researcher.<br>
3. CONCLUSIONS<br>
The results obtained in this trial show that the oral administration of EV<br>
solution mixed in the milk substitute, at a dose of 1 ml / 10 kg live weight<br>
(equivalent to 3 mg/ kg of active ingredient, ketoprofen) for three consecutive<br>
days, administered complementarily to antibacterial treatment for BRD in<br>
lactating calves significantly helps to alleviate symptoms and to accelerate the<br>
animal's recovery.<br>
It can, therefore, be concluded that the EV solution presents a good<br>
clinical efficacy as a coadjuvant treatment to antibacterial treatment of Bovine<br>
Respiratory Disease in lactating calves.<br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
STUDY OF THE CLINICAL EFFICACY OF AN AQUEOUS SOLUTION OF<br>
KETOPROFEN ADMINISTERED ORALLY IN THE DRINKING WATER<br>
COMPLEMENTARY TO ANTIBACTERIAL TREATMENT OF PORCINE<br>
RESPIRATORY DISEASE COMPLEX<br>
A clinical study was conducted with the aim of evaluating the clinical<br>
efficacy of the EV solution of ketoprofen at 3% (Example 1), after its oral<br>
administration in the drinking water as a coadjuvant to the antibiotic treatment of<br>
Porcine Respiratory Disease Complex (PRDC) in pig herds during fattening.<br>
1. MATERIAL AND METHODS<br>
1.1 ANIMALS<br>
Before a pig stockyard was included in the study, the existence of an<br>
outbreak of PRDC was confirmed. This diagnosis was made by autopsy of<br>
animals found dead in the yard taking samples of lung, lymph nodes and<br>
thymus. If no animals had died by the start of the study animals with the worst<br>
clinical status were sacrificed. After selecting a pig stockyard, animals that<br>
fulfilled the following criteria were selected:<br>
- Pigs in the fattening phase diagnosed with an outbreak of PRDC<br>
presenting a rectal temperature over 39.5 °C; and<br>
- animals who had not received antibacterial or antiinflammatory drugs in<br>
the seven days before the selection.<br>
At the start of the study, groups of marked animals were distributed into<br>
two treatment groups: Group A and Group B, such that each group had a<br>
similar number of animals.<br>
During the study, all the animals received a standard pig feed for the<br>
fattening phase and drinking water in automatic drinking apparatus connected<br>
by a dosifier to special water tanks for the medicated formula.<br>

1.2.2 Dose, therapeutic regime and route of administration<br>
1.2.2.1 Antibiotics<br>
The antibiotic product was administered by intramuscular route in the<br>
dose and therapeutic regime recommended by the manufacturer. Duration of<br>
the treatment was 3 days (Days 1, 2 and 3).<br>
1.2.2.2 Products evaluated (A and B)<br>
Both products were administered orally in the drinking water with the following<br>
dose and administration regime: 1 ml of Product A or B /10 kg of live weight<br>
(equivalent to 3 mg ketoprofen / kg live weight / day in the case of the treated<br>
group). Duration of the treatment was 3 days (Days 1, 2 and 3).<br>
1.3 EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN<br>
After selecting a pig stockyard, all the marked animals received an<br>
antibiotic treatment of enrofloxacin by intramuscular route. The animals from the<br>
yards assigned to one of the treatment groups also received oral treatment with<br>
the EV solution added to their drinking water, and those assigned to the other<br>
group were administered Placebo (solution excipient) by the same route.<br>
The total study period was 4 days. Treatments were administered on the<br>
first three days (D1, D2 and D3). Clinical monitoring of animals was done from<br>
the start (D1) until the end (D4) of treatment. Over the study period, four clinical<br>
controls were carried out in the morning of each day indicated:<br>
Controls D1, D2 and D3: during treatment with antibiotic + Product A or<br>
B (control D1 was carried out before the start of the treatment and can be<br>
considered as a basal control).<br>
Control Day 4: at the end of the treatment.<br>
Several individual and group parameters were measured in each<br>
control.<br>
1.3.1 Individual parameters<br>
Clinical Index: This parameter was measured in controls D1, D2, D3<br>
and D4. This Index was calculated by a score scale based on one described<br>
previously [Raynaud (1986), Deleforge (1992), cited supra]. This parameter was<br>
used to measure the main variable (section 3.3.1).<br>
Temperature: This parameter (°C) was measured during controls D1,<br>
D2, D3 and D4.<br>
Weight: This parameter (kg) was measured in controls D1 and D4.<br>
1.3.2 Collective parameters<br>
General status of the stockyard: This parameter was measured daily in<br>
Controls D1 to D4, on an ordinal scale according to the following scores and<br>
evaluating the group of animals together.<br>
Intake of feed: This parameter corresponds to the total amount of feed<br>
consumed by the animals in each group.<br>
Mortality: This parameter corresponds to the number of deaths<br>
estimated for each group over the study.<br>
1.3.3 Measurement of study variables<br>
1.3.3.1 Main variable<br>
The main study variable can be defined as the "Reduction in clinical<br>
index " (RCI).<br>
1.3.3.2 Secondary variables<br>
Rectal temperature: This variable coincides with the value of the<br>
Temperature parameter measured in every control in which it has been<br>
recorded.<br>
Weight increase (Wl): This variable was estimated by applying the<br>
following formula:<br>
Wl: Mean value (marked animals) (Weight D4 - Weight D1)<br>
1.4 STATISTICAL PROCEDURES<br>
The main study variable "Clinical Index" was analysed by the Student's T<br>
test considering a significance level a = 0.05 and a power of 80%.<br>
The secondary variables "Temperature" and "Weight" were measured by<br>
ANOVA for repeated measures taking a significance level a= 0.05 and a power<br>
of 80%.<br>
The other parameters measured during the study were analysed by<br>
descriptive statistical techniques.<br>
2. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION<br>
The results corresponding to the rectal temperature profile are shown in<br>
Table 8 and Figure 6.<br>
NS = No statistically significant differences between the two groups (p&gt;0.05)<br>
As can be observed in Table 8 and in Figure 6, in spite of the mean basal<br>
value of temperature being very similar in both groups, on the second day of<br>
treatment this value was significantly lower in Group B (EV solution) than in<br>
group A (Placebo). Similarly, from Figure 6, the drop in temperature in group B<br>
was pronounced and mainly occurred on the first day of treatment. In contrast,<br>
in group A this decline, in addition to it not being as pronounced as for Group B,<br>
occurred gradually over the treatment period.<br>
The results obtained for evolution of the clinical index are compiled in<br>
Table 9 and Figure 7.<br>
NS = No statistically significant differences between the groups (p&gt;0.05)<br>
From Table 9 and Figure 7, the percentage of animals treated<br>
successfully was significantly higher in the group treated with the EV solution<br>
than in the group treated with Placebo.<br>
3. CONCLUSIONS<br>
According to these results, administration of EV solution to the drinking<br>
water as a coadjuvant treatment to the antibacterial treatment of PRDC,<br>
presents a beneficial therapeutic effect compared to the treatment of this<br>
disease with antibiotics alone.<br>
It can be stated, on the basis of the results of this study, that the EV<br>
solution has a good clinical efficacy as a coadjuvant treatment to antibacterial<br>
treatment of Porcine Respiratory Disease Complex in fattening pigs.<br>
From the results obtained in the present study, it can be deduced that<br>
administration of the EV solution orally in the drinking water, at a dose of 1 ml /<br>
10 kg live weight (equivalent to 3 mg/ kg of active ingredient, ketoprofen) for<br>
three consecutive days, complementarily to antibacterial treatment of Porcine<br>
Respiratory Disease Complex (PRDC) in fattening pigs, results in increased<br>
speed of recovery from clinical symptoms and this EV solution presents a good<br>
clinical efficacy as a coadjuvant of antibacterial treatment of PRDC in fattening<br>
pigs.<br>
