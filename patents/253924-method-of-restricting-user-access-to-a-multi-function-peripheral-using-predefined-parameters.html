				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates a Multi Function Peripheral (MFP) device. Further, the present invention relates to a printing system that is capable of storing a print job permanently in a data storage device. More particularly the present invention relates to a method of restricted access to MFP using predefined parameters.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
Figure 1 represents the block diagram of the prior art.<br>
The print data from each client apparatus is referred to as a print job. A print job is usually coded in a page description language and consists of digitized image data and job attributes including job disposition information, as well as job identification information, such as job name.<br>
Conventional printers are capable of storing print jobs in data storage devices such as hard disk drive. This allows making multiple copies of a job, to store print jobs permanently for future printing of additional copies, to allow user to print confidential documents by entering a privacy code via the user interface.<br>
A job saved in the storage device is referred to as a stored job. Stored jobs can be controlled through the user panel or a special application run on the client apparatus. In the latter case the special commands, sent from the client apparatus to the printing controller are used.<br>
Information about stored jobs is displayed as a list. A user can release a stored job for printing or delete it from the storage device by viewing the displayed list of the stored jobs. Typically, to perform a desired operation on a stored job, the user should select a job from the list, input a correct privacy code (for confidential jobs), and then assign the operation with appropriate attributes. <br>
There is a printing system that keeps a user information file in the storage device. The user information file consists of user information records for all the clients of the printing system. The user information record includes user attributes and the list of stored jobs. The user attributes can include a user name, a user private code, and a user priority. The user name is used to access user's stored jobs. The user priority can be used to affect the order of job processing. The user private key is used to access confidential jobs.<br>
The printing system keeps a list of active users in RAM. The term "active user" means a user, which currently has jobs stored in the storage device. Supporting the list of active users makes it possible to save time for the management of stored jobs.<br>
A job, submitted from the client apparatus and intended to be stored in the printing system, includes the user identification information, such as user name and user private code. Having stored, the job is added to the user's stored job list of the appropriate user.<br>
Printing system supports a means of maintaining the user information file. This means comprises functions to add new user, change some user information record, and to delete some user information record. These functions are available through the user interface of the printing controller or through an application run on the client apparatus.<br>
A user can access the user's stored job list through the control panel by selecting the desired user name from the list of active users. The user accesses all jobs from the user's stored job list if he enters the correct user private code. Otherwise, he can access only public (non-confidential) jobs from the user's stored job list<br>
There are two main operations to process stored jobs: printing additional copies and deleting from the storage device. Each of these operations can be executed on a number of jobs. The jobs that are supposed to perform the same operation must be first selected by the user. Each selected job is added to a processing list. The operation is applied to all jobs, which are currently in a processing list.<br>
To add a job to the processing list through the control panel, "SELECT" menu is used. Accordingly, to remove a job from the processing list, "UNSELECT" menu is used. "SELECT ALL" menu is also available.<br>
The entire prior art describes the restriction of user using an external entity like a server. They don't talk about the restriction of users with respect to services available on the device (MFP). Further the information used for restricting the user is not stored on the device itself. Further, the patent does not claim or describe a specific method for maintaining user profile.<br>
US Patent No. 20020056747A1 titled "Person Authentication System, Person Authentication Method, Information Processing Apparatus, and Program Providing Medium" discloses a system for restricting the usage of a data communication system such as a personal computer. In an embodiment of the disclosed system, the user authentication execution entity has a user authentication executing device. The user authentication executing device checks the authentication of users, also checks, and updates a usage count. In case the usage count for a user is greater than a specified limit the user is not granted access. The patent, however, does not claim or describe a specific method for restricting user access based on other predefined measurable parameters. Further, the patent does not mention the application of the disclosed system on an MFP.<br>
The Japanese Patent No. JP2003067174A2 discloses a server device for restricting the usage of a printer. The server device enables setting different limits on the number of prints for different users. The patent publication, however, does not claim or describe a specific method for restricting user access based on other predefined measurable parameters. Further, the patent publication does not mention the application of the disclosed server device on an MFP. <br>
Another Japanese Patent No. JP2003205666A2 discloses a user management server computer for restricting the usage of a printer. The user management server limits the number of prints for a user. The patent, however, does not claim or describe a specific method for user authentication. Further, the patent publication does not claim or describe a specific method for restricting user access based on other predefined measurable parameters. Also, the patent does not mention the application of the disclosed server device on an MFP.<br>
US Patent bearing No. 20020136564A1 titled "Image Formation Control Method, Image Forming Apparatus using the same and Storage Medium to Which the same is applied" discloses a method for limiting the number of prints for a particular document. The patent, however, does not claim or describe a specific method for setting different limits on the number of prints for different users. Further, the patent does not claim or describe a specific method for maintaining user profile.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The primary object of the invention is to provide a restricted access to a device based on some predefined parameters.<br>
The invention relates to a method for enabling an administrator to restrict user access to a Multi-Functional Peripheral (MFP) based on predefined measurable parameters. For example, the administrator may set the maximum number of operations on the MFP for the user. If the user exceeds the set maximum number of operations, then the user is intimated with proper error messages. Further, the invention enables operations on a stored job. The enabling of such operations is, however, known in the art.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention explains a method of restricted access to MFP using predefined parameters comprising the steps of: (a) maintaining a profile for each user;<br>
(b)	storing the said profiles in the user information store of the MFP;<br>
(c)	logging the user into MFP;<br>
(d)	initiating the corresponding operation;<br>
(e)	checking the corresponding operation count by the MFP;<br>
(f)	processing the job successfully when the said count is greater than ZERO; and<br>
(g)	displaying the corresponding error message if the said count is equal to ZERO.<br>
These and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become more readily apparent from the detailed description taken in conjunction with the drawings and the claims.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
Figure 1 is a block diagram of prior art.<br>
Figure 2 is a flow diagram showing the user information area.<br>
Figure 3 is a flow chart showing the sequence of operation.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings. It should be understood however that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention, which may be embodied in various forms. The following description and drawings are not to be construed as limiting the invention and numerous specific details are described to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention, as the basis for the claims and as a basis for teaching one skilled in the art how to make and/or use the invention. However in certain instances, well-known or conventional details are not described in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention in detail. <br>
Figure 2 represents the User Area and the information stored in that area for that particular user.<br>
Each User has to provide his user name and password before accessing/using any of the features of a MFP. So for each user there will be a profile maintained on MFP. The profile for each user contains various information. This profile can be altered by System Administrator Only. As mentioned in the invention this profile contains the following fields<br>
1)	User Name<br>
2)	Password<br>
3)	Maximum Scan Operations Allowed<br>
4)	Maximum Fax Operations Allowed<br>
5)	Maximum Scan2Email Operations Allowed<br>
6)	Maximum Number of stored Jobs.<br>
7)	Number of Stored Jobs.<br>
8)	.	List of Stored Jobs.<br>
This information is used whenever a user logs into the system to gain access. The maximum count on operations can be extended to all available features on the device (MFP).<br>
Figure 3 represents the sequence of operations for a normal user. The user logs into the device by giving his user name and password. If the provided information is correct then he will be allowed to access the facilities offered by the device (MFP). If he tries to access any service then the corresponding operation count is fetched and verified. If the count is equal to zero then he will be notified with an error message. If the count is greater than zero then the count will be decremented and the service will be provided to him.<br>
The user interface sitting on Administrator's PC helps in defining some rules that are applicable to ail the users, who have permission to access the MFP. For each user some maximum amount of jobs that he can do with that device is determined and set by the Admin. For example Admin can set that userl can do a maximum of 100 fax operations for that day and he can set these types of rules on all the services offered by that MFP. These settings are stored in the user information and before doing any operation MFP reads information from this and decides whether s/he can do that operation. If user exceeds this value s/he is intimated with the proper error messages.<br>
Mainly the invention involves Admin PC and MFP. The application running on Admin's PC is used to set the parameters based on some predefined limits for a user. Ul running on PC shows the users list who have access to MFP and the parameters he can set for each user.<br>
Once the admin applies the rules they are stored into the respective user information area.<br>
Lets take a scenario in which MFP is communicating to PC.<br>
STEP 1: User logs into MFP.<br>
STEP 2: Press the corresponding operation button.<br>
STEP 3: MFP checks the corresponding operation count.<br>
STEP 4: If Count is greater than ZERO then the count is decremented and the job is processed.<br>
STEP 5: If Count is equal to zero then the corresponding error message is displayed to the user.<br>
This is a new feature for providing restricted access to the MFP.<br>
