SYNTHESIS AND PURIFICATION OF PTEROIC ACID AND CONJUGATES<br>
THEREOF<br>
CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION<br>
This application claims the benefit under 35 U.S.C. ยง 119(e) of U.S.<br>
Provisional Application Serial No. 60/662,277, filed March 16, 2005, the disclosure<br>
of which is hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
This invention pertains to the purification of pteroic acid and<br>
derivatives of pteroic acid, and to the purification of pteroic acid, and analogs and<br>
derivatives of pteroic acid, conjugated to other compounds. This invention also<br>
pertains to methods for preparing pteroic acid, and analogs and derivatives of pteroic<br>
acid, conjugated to other compounds. This invention also pertains to methods for<br>
treating patients with pteroic acid, and analogs and derivatives of pteroic acid,<br>
conjugated to other compounds.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Pteroic acid is a convenient starting material for making folate<br>
derivatives that can be conjugated to drugs for use as conjugates in therapies that<br>
include vitamin receptor-based targeting. Vitamin-drug conjugates can be targeted,<br>
for example, to cancer cells that uniquely express, over-express, or preferentially<br>
express vitamin receptors. Illustratively, pteroic acid has been used as the starting<br>
material for the preparation of a conjugate comprising a folic acid derivative linked to<br>
fluorescein via a gamma carboxyl-linked ethylene diamine bridge. This conjugate is<br>
described in U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 09/822,379, the disclosure of which is<br>
incorporated herein by reference. The conjugate is used to label pathogenic cells,<br>
such as cancer cells, with fluorescein to make the cancer cells antigenic resulting in<br>
their recognition and elimination by the host immune system.<br>
Pteroic acid may be prepared by a variety of conventional means<br>
including by synthesis, microbial degradation of folic acid, enzymatic degradation of<br>
folic acid, hydrolysis of folic acid, and other conventional methods. Generally,<br>
pteroic acid prepared by these methods is contaminated by folic acid, often in<br><br>
substantial amounts. For example, pteroic acid prepared by enzymatic degradation<br>
can contain as much as 25% folic acid. Accordingly, efficient methods are needed to<br>
remove folic acid contaminants and other impurities from preparations of pteroic acid.<br>
Vitamin-drug conjugates, including conjugates of pteroic acid may be<br>
prepared using synthetic methods. In some cases, those synthetic methods may also<br>
lead to the formation of side products, impurities, or other contaminants.<br>
Accordingly, synthetic and/or purification methods are needed to either avoid the<br>
formation of these side products, impurities, or other contaminants, or to remove these<br>
side products, impurities, or other contaminants from the vitamin-drug conjugates.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
Methods for purifying pteroic acid, derivatives and analogs of pteroic<br>
acid, and/or combinations thereof are described herein. In one embodiment, the<br>
methods include the steps of (a) contacting a solution comprising pteroic acid,<br>
derivatives or analogs of pteroic acid, and/or combinations thereof, with an ion<br>
exchange chromatographic support; (b) eluting a first fraction comprising pteroic<br>
acid, derivatives or analogs of pteroic acid, and/or combinations thereof, with a<br>
mobile phase having a pH of about 10 or greater; and (c) lowering the pH of the first<br>
fraction to about 3 or less; and (d) precipitating pteroic acid, derivatives or analogs of<br>
pteroic acid, and/or combinations thereof.<br>
In one variation, the methods described herein may also include the<br>
step of (e) eluting a second fraction comprising folic acid, derivatives of folic acid, or<br>
combinations thereof, where the first fraction and the second fraction are substantially<br>
separated. Substantial separation may be determined by any number of objective<br><br>
quantitative or qualitative criteria, including but not limited to elapsed time, fraction<br>
number, baseline evaluation, or other method that assesses the degree of overlap<br>
between the eluting fractions, and therefore the likelihood and degree of possible<br>
cross-contamination of the first and/or second fractions. It has been observed that for<br>
certain saccharide-based chromatographic supports or resins, the folic acid fraction<br>
elutes prior in time to the pteroic acid fraction, which elutes later in time.<br>
Illustrtively, for DEAE cellulose chromatographic supports, the folic acid fraction has<br>
been observed to elute prior in time to the pteroic acid fraction, which elutes later in<br>
time. However, it is to be understood that for different chromatographic supports,<br>
including different saccharide-based chromatographic supports, it is contemplated<br>
herein that the order of elution of the first and second fractions as described herein<br>
may change.<br>
In another embodiment, the methods described herein include the steps<br>
of (a) contacting a solution comprising pteroic acid, derivatives of pteroic acid, or<br>
combinations thereof, with an anion exchange chromatographic support; and<br>
(b) eluting a first fraction comprising pteroic acid, derivatives of pteroic acid, or<br>
combinations thereof.<br>
In one variation, the eluting step includes a mobile phase having a pH<br>
of about 11 or greater, or a pH of about 11.5 or greater. In another variation, the pH is<br>
in the range from about 11 to about 13. The pH of the mobile phase may be adjusted<br>
or obtained by the addition of a wide variety of bases, including but not limited to<br>
NaOH, KOH, Na2CO3, NaHCO3, KHCO3, K2CO3, NH4OH, and the like.<br>
In one aspect, chromatographic supports for the chromatography<br>
methods described herein include but are not limited to ion-exchange resins, anion-<br>
exchange resins, saccharide-based resins, saccharide-based ion-exchange resins,<br>
saccharide-based anion-exchange resins, and the like. Saccharide-based<br>
chromatographic supports include one or more cellulose, amylose, agarose, sepharose,<br>
and sephadex resins, and combinations thereof. In another aspect, saccharide-based<br>
chromatographic supports include ion-exchange resins, such as an anionic exchange<br>
resins and cationic exchange resins. Illustrative saccharide-based ion-exchange resins<br>
include diethylaminoethyl (DEAE) cellulose or quaternary amine (QA) cellulose solid<br>
supports, such as DE23, DE32, DE51, DE52, DE53, and QA52, each available from<br>
Whatman and/or Sigma. In one illustrative variation, the chromatographic support is<br><br>
a pre-swollen microgranular DE52 anion exchanger (Whatman Cat. No. 4057-200).<br>
In another illustrative variation, the chromatographic support is a pre-swollen<br>
microgranular DE32 anion exchanger. Additional solid supports include DEAE<br>
Sephadex, CM Sephadex, Sephadex QA, Sepharose QA, and the like.<br>
In another embodiment, the mobile phase is a reverse phase mobile<br>
phase comprising water. In another embodiment, the mobile phase is a reverse phase<br>
mobile phase comprising water and a salt. In another embodiment, the mobile phase<br>
is a reverse phase mobile phase comprising water and an organic solvent. In another<br>
embodiment, the mobile phase is a reverse phase mobile phase comprising water, a<br>
salt, and an organic solvent. In another aspect, the mobile phase is substantially free<br>
or completely free of ammonia, or salts thereof.<br>
In another embodiment, the mobile phase is a reverse phase mobile<br>
phase comprising water at a specified pH, including a neutral or near neutral pH. In<br>
one variation, the pH is slightly above neutrality, such as a pH in the range from about<br>
7.1 to about 7.7. In one aspect, the pH of the mobile phase is in the range from about<br>
7.3 to about 7.5, or at a pH of about 7.4. In another embodiment, the mobile phase is<br>
a reverse phase mobile phase comprising water and a salt. In another embodiment,<br>
the mobile phase is a reverse phase mobile phase comprising water and an organic<br>
solvent. In another embodiment, the mobile phase is a reverse phase mobile phase<br>
comprising water, a salt, and an organic solvent. In another aspect, the mobile phase<br>
is substantially free or completely free of ammonia, or salts thereof.<br>
The chromatography profile may use the mobile phase at a fixed<br>
relative composition or in a varying relative composition, including, but not limited<br>
to, isocratic profiles, step functions, simple gradients, complex gradients, linear<br>
gradients, logarithmic gradients, combinations of such profiles, and the like.<br>
In another embodiment, the mobile phases used in the methods<br>
described herein may also optionally include an organic solvent as a component, such<br>
as an acetone, tetrahydrofuran, acetonitrile, alcohols, including MeOH, EtOH, and the<br>
like, and others. When the mobile phase includes two components, such as the<br>
aqueous component having a basic pH and an organic solvent component, the mobile<br>
phase may be eluted through the chromatographic support in an isocratic mode, or in<br>
a gradient mode. It is appreciated that gradient modes may follow a wide variety of<br><br>
profiles, including linear, logarithmic, hyperbolic, parabolic, exponential, step, and<br>
combinations thereof.<br>
In another embodiment, the eluent from the column chromatography is<br>
monitored by any conventional technique including, but not limited to, ultraviolet<br>
(UV) absorbance, fluorescence, refractive index (RI), liquid chromatography mass<br>
spectrometry (LCMS), tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS), and the like.<br>
Illustratively, the eluent is divided into one or more fractions based on the monitoring,<br>
and the fractions containing the desired product and having a purity at or above a<br>
predetermined threshold are pooled. The pooled fractions are included in the<br>
precipitating step.<br>
In another embodiment of the precipitating step, the pteroic acid, or<br>
analog or derivative thereof, contained in fractions or pooled fractions of the eluent is<br>
precipitated from the solution by lowering the pH of the solution to a pH of about 3.5<br>
or less, about 3 or less, about 2.5 or less, or about 2 or less. The pH may be lowered<br>
by the addition of any variety of acids or any combination of acids capable of<br>
lowering the pH to about 3.5 or less, about 3 or less, about 2.5 or less, or about 2 or<br>
less. Illustrative acids include, but are not limited to, hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic<br>
acid, sulfuric acid and salts thereof, phosphoric acid and salts thereof, nitric acid, and<br>
the like.<br>
In one aspect, the precipitated and/or purified pteroic acid or analog or<br>
derivative thereof is purified to about 95% purity or greater, about 96% purity or<br>
greater, about 97% purity or greater, about 98% purity or greater, about 99% purity or<br>
greater, or about 100% purity. In another aspect, the precipitated pteroic acid or<br>
analog or derivative thereof is substantially free of folic acid. The purity of the<br>
precipitated pteroic acid or analog or derivative thereof may be measured using any<br>
conventional technique, including various chromatography or spectroscopic<br>
techniques, such as high pressure or high performance liquid chromatography<br>
(HPLC), nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, TLC, UV absorbance<br>
spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, and the like.<br>
In another aspect, the precipitated or purified pteroic acid, pteroic acid<br>
analogs, and/or pteroic acid derivatives have purities understood as being<br>
substantially pure, or substantially purified from one or more undesired or unwanted<br>
components, impurities, or contaminants. Illustratively, the purity of these<br><br>
compounds may be understood as having less than a percentage of one or more<br>
components, such as about 5% or less of an impurity, about 4% or less of an impurity,<br>
about 3% or less of an impurity, about 2% or less of an impurity, or about 1% or less<br>
of an impurity. Similarly, the purity of these compounds may be understood as<br>
having less than a percentage of a specific component, such as about 5% or less, about<br>
4% or less, about 3% or less, about 2% or less, or about 1% or less of folic acid.<br>
In another embodiment, pteroic acid, pteroic acid analogs, and pteroic<br>
acid derivatives are prepared by synthetic methods described herein. These synthetic<br>
methods result in compounds that have high overall percentage purities, such as about<br>
95% pure or greater, about 96% pure or greater, about 97% pure or greater, about<br>
98% pure of greater, about 99% pure or greater, or about 100% pure. Similarly, the<br>
purity of such pteroic acid, pteroic acid analogs, and pteroic acid derivatives are<br>
prepared by synthetic methods described herein may be understood as having less<br>
than a percentage of a specific component, such as about 5% or less, about 4% or less,<br>
about 3% or less, about 2% or less, or about 1% or less of folic acid, as a result of the<br>
synthetic method used, alone or in combination with a purification method described<br>
herein.<br>
It is appreciated that specific components in the resulting pteroic acid,<br>
pteroic acid analog, pteroic acid derivative, or combination thereof may be either<br>
avoided or removed. Those components may be avoided by using the synthetic<br>
processes described herein. In addition, those components may be removed by using<br>
the purification methods described herein. Therefore, it is to be understood that the<br>
invention also includes materials that are prepared by the synthetic processes<br>
described herein, are produced from or result from use of the purification methods<br>
described herein, or result from a combination of these synthetic processes and<br>
purification methods.<br>
In one embodiment, the pteroic acid or the derivative of pteroic acid is<br>
derived from a degradation process, such as a degradation of a folic acid or a<br>
derivative of folic acid. In one aspect, the pteroic acid or the derivative of pteroic<br>
acid is derived from an enzymatic degradation process, such as an enzymatic<br>
degradation of a folic acid or a derivative of folic acid. In another aspect, the pteroic<br>
acid or the derivative of pteroic acid is derived from a microbial degradation process,<br>
such as a microbial degradation of a folic acid or a derivative of folic acid. In another<br><br>
aspect, the pteroic acid or the derivative of pteroic acid is derived from a chemical<br>
degradation process, such as a chemical degradation of a folic acid or a derivative of<br>
folic acid. In another embodiment, the pteroic acid or the derivative of pteroic acid is<br>
derived from a chemical synthesis.<br>
In one embodiment of the microbial degradation processes, folic acid<br>
or derivatives thereof are hydrolyzed to pteroic acid by contacting a sample of the<br>
folic acid or derivative thereof with Alcaligenes faecalis, Psuedomonad,<br>
Psuedomonad ATCC 25301, flavobacterium, flavobacterium baccalis, and the like.<br>
Illustrative conditions for performing microbial degradation of folic acid are<br>
described by Houlihan et a!., Anal. Biochem., 46:1-6 (1972), Pratt et al., J. Biol.<br>
Chem., 243:6367 (1968); Levy et al., J. Biol. Chem., 242:2933 (1967); Scott, Methods<br>

In one embodiment of the enzymatic degradation processes, folic acid<br>
or derivatives thereof are hydrolyzed to pteroic acid by contacting a sample of the<br>
folic acid or derivative thereof with one or more enzymes such as carboxypeptidases,<br>
including carboxypeptidase G, carboxypeptidase A, amidases, lipases, esterases, and<br>
proteases, and combinations thereof. In the case of carboxypeptidase G, folic acid is<br>
contacted with the enzyme at slightly basic pH, illustratively a pH of about 7.3.<br>
Illustrative conditions for performing enzymatic degradation of folic acid is described<br>
by Harvison &amp; Kalman, J. Med. Chem. 35:1227-33 (1992); Nomura et al, J. Org.<br>

In one embodiment of the chemical degradation processes, folic acid or<br>
derivatives thereof are hydrolyzed to pteroic acid by contacting a sample of the folic<br>
acid or derivative thereof under acid or basic hydrolysis, or saponification conditions,<br>

pteroic acid that is purified using the methods described herein is one resulting from a<br>
conventional degradation or synthetic process and is contaminated with a folic acid,<br>
or analog or derivative thereof. Illustratively, enzymatic degradation processes that<br><br>
convert folic acids, or analogs or derivatives thereof, to pteroic acids, or the<br>
corresponding analogs or derivatives thereof, may not proceed to complete<br>
conversion. Therefore, the resulting mixture may include the pteroic acid or<br>
derivative thereof, the folic acid or derivative thereof, and/or one or more partially<br>
degraded or hydrolyzed intermediate products or side products formed during the<br>
enzymatic degradation process or hydrolysis process. Illustratively, the relative<br>
amount of the folic acid or derivative thereof is in the range from about 1% to about<br>
50%, or from about 1% to about 25%.<br>

derivative of pteroic acid, pteroic acid or a derivative or analog of pteroic acid, is<br>
coupled with another molecule to form a vitamin-drug conjugate. In one aspect, the<br>
vitamin-drug conjugate is illustratively a conjugate described in U.S. Patent<br>

In another aspect, the vitamin-drug conjugate may be described by the<br>
formula<br><br>
where V is a vitamin, or an analog or a derivative thereof, and L is an optional<br>
bivalent linker having a length of about 1 to about 100 atoms. The atoms are selected<br>

In another aspect, the vitamin-drug conjugate is a conjugate of pteroic<br>
acid or an analog or derivative thereof, and fluorescein or an analog or derivative<br>
thereof. In another aspect, the vitamin-drug conjugate is a compound of formula I<br><br>

(a) amide coupling reagent; (b) selective deprotection of ฮฑ-carboxyl group;<br>
(c) H2NCH2(CH2)nNH2, n=1-4 (5); (d) 1. FITC (7); 2. optional deprotection of any of<br>
R1 to R5.<br>
where R1, R2, R3, and R4 are each independently hydrogen, alkyl, acyl, or a suitably<br>

Protected pteroic acid analog 1 is reacted with protected amino acid<br>
analog 2 to form amide 3. Suitable protecting groups R1, R2, R3, and R4 for pteroic<br>
acid 1 include amide protecting groups, such as acetyl, trifluoroacetyl, and the like,<br>
carbamate protecting groups, such as tert-Boc, Teoc, Cbz, Fmoc, and the like, and<br>
others. Suitable protecting groups R5 for amino acid analog 2 include ester protecting<br>
groups, such as methyl, trimethylsilylethyl, tert-butyl, and the like, and others. In one<br>
aspect, where R5 is tert-butyl, resulting amide 3 is selectively deprotected with acid to<br>
give amide 4. It is appreciated that is this aspect, the protecting groups present on<br>
pteroic acid analog 1 and amino acid analog 2 are suitably selected to allow the<br>
selective deprotection of the ฮฑ-carboxylate protecting group in the presence of the ฮณ-<br>
carboxylate protecting group.<br>
Either amide 3 or the corresponding deprotected analog 4 is treated<br>
with an alkylene diamine of the formula H2NCH2(CH2)nNH2, where n=1-4 to give<br><br>
amine 6. The terminal methyl ester is displaced to form an amide bond. Amine 6 is<br>
treated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC, 7) to form vitamin-drug conjugate 8.<br>
A wide variety of amide coupling reagents and conditions are<br>
applicable to the syntheses described herein, including but not limited to carboxylic<br>
acid derivatives, such as acid chlorides and the like; activated esters, such as<br>
pentafluorophenyl esters, hydroxybenzotriazole esters, and the like; coupling<br>
reagents, such as (benzotriazol-l-yloxy)tripyrrolidinophosphonium<br>
hexaflourophosphate (PyBOP), BOP, BOPCl, DCC, EDC, HBTU, TBTU, PyBrOP,<br>
and the like. Suitable solvents for the amide coupling steps described herein include<br>
but are not limited to N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO),<br>
chloroform, dichloromethane (DCM), N-methylpyrrolidinone (NMP), and the like.<br>
The amide coupling steps described herein may be performed at many temperatures,<br>
such as temperatures in the range from about 0 ยฐC to about 50 ยฐC, and illustratively at<br>
ambient temperature.<br>
The deprotecting steps described herein may be performed in any<br>
conventional manner, such as using the reagents and reaction conditions described in<br>
Greene &amp; Wuts "Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis," 2d Ed., John Wiley &amp;<br>
Sons, New York, 1991, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. It<br>
is appreciated that the choice of deprotecting reagents and conditions is made to allow<br>
the deprotecting step to proceed without unintentionally affecting other functional<br>
groups, including other protecting groups, present on the compounds being<br>
deprotected. For example, in Scheme 1, protecting group R5 is removed in the<br>
presence of and without affecting protecting group R4. In one illustrative<br>
embodiment, protecting group R5 is a tot-butyl ester, and protecting group R4 is a<br>
trifluoroacetyl amide. Illustrative deprotecting agents for deprotecting acid sensitive<br>
protecting groups include but are not limited to trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), HC1, HBr,<br>
AcOH, HCO2H, and the like. The deprotecting reaction may be performed in a<br>
variety of solvents, including but not limited to water, DCM, EtOAc, AcOH, and the<br>
like. It is appreciated that cation scavengers may also be included in the reaction<br>
conditions to improve the rate and/or overall yield of the deprotecting reactions,<br>
including with the use of AcOH as a solvent. The deprotecting reactions described<br>
herein may be performed at a variety of temperatures, such as temperatures in the<br>
range from about 0 ยฐC to about 50 ยฐC, and illustratively at ambient temperature.<br><br>
Step (c) in Scheme 1 may be performed in a variety of solvents,<br>
including but not limited to THF, ether, DMF, DMSO, chloroform, DCM, NMP, and<br>
the like, and may be performed at a variety of temperatures, such as temperatures in<br>
the range from about 0 ยฐC to about 50 ยฐC, and illustratively at ambient temperature.<br>
Similarly, step (d) in Scheme 1 may be performed in a variety of solvents, including<br>
but not limited to THF, DMF, DMSO, chloroform, CH2Cl2, NMP, water, and the like,<br>
and may be performed at a variety of temperatures, such as temperatures in the range<br>
from about 0 ยฐC to about 50 ยฐC, and illustratively at ambient temperature. Additional<br>
bases may be added to the reaction illustrated in step (d), including but not limited to<br>
amine bases generally represented by R1R2R3N, Et3N, N,N-diisopropylethylamine<br>
(DIPEA), pyridine, lutidine, collidine, 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP), and the<br>
like.<br>
It is appreciated that certain protecting groups may be<br>
contemporaneously and conveniently removed during step (c) upon reaction with the<br>
diamine H2NCH2(CH2)nNH2. For example, when R4 is an amide protecting group,<br>
such as trifluoroacetyl and the like, both the methyl ester is replaced to form the<br>
amide of the gamma- glutamate, and the amide protecting group is removed at N(10).<br>
In one variation, the group R4 is selected to be stable to reaction with diamine<br>
H2NCH2(CH2)nNH2.<br>
In another variation, the reaction of pteroic acid analog 1 and amino<br>
acid analog 2 is accomplished by converting protected pteroic acid analog 1 to a<br>
corresponding carboxylic acid derivative having a leaving group. The leaving group<br>
is displaced by the amine of amino acid analog 2 to form amide 3. It is appreciated<br>
that the synthesis shown in Scheme 1, and variations thereof, may also be used to<br>
prepare fluorescein conjugates of pteroic acid analogs, and derivatives of pteroic acid<br>
analogs, as described herein.<br>
Another illustrative chemical synthesis of conjugates of pteroic acid,<br>
and derivatives thereof, is shown in Scheme 2.<br><br><br>
(a) amide coupling reagent; (b) selective deprotection of amino acid amine group;<br>
(c) amide coupling reagent; (d) selective deprotection of alkylene diamine;<br>
(e) 1. FITC (7); 2. optional deprotection of any of R1 to R5.<br>
where R1, R2, R3, and R4 are each, independently hydrogen, allcyl, acyl, or a suitably<br>
selected nitrogen protecting group; R5 is hydrogen, alkyl, or a suitably selected<br>
carboxyl protecting group; m is an integer from 0-4; n is an integer from 1-4; and R ,<br>
R7, and R8 are each independently hydrogen or a suitably selected nitrogen protecting<br>
group.<br>
Protected amino acid analog 9 is reacted with protected<br>
alkylenediamine 10 to form amide 11. Illustrative protecting groups R5 for amino<br>
acid analog 7 include Fmoc, Cbz, tert-Boc, and the like. Illustrative protecting groups<br>
R7 for alkylenediamine 10 include tert-Boc, Fmoc, Cbz, and the like. It is appreciated<br>
that the protecting groups are chosen to allow for the selective removal of one or more<br>
in the presence of the remaining protecting groups, and without altering the nature of<br>
the other functional groups remaining on the molecule being deprotected. Resulting<br>
amide 11 is deprotected to give amino acid amine 12, which is coupled with protected<br>
pteroic acid analog 1, where illustrative protecting groups R4 for pteroic acid analog 1<br>
are as described herein, to form amide 13. Resulting amide 13 is deprotected to give<br>
alkylenediamine amine 6. In some variations, depending upon the nature of the<br>
carboxyl protecting group R5, the conditions used to remove the terminal amine<br>
protection groups R7 and R8 may also remove the carboxyl protection group R5. For<br><br>
example, when R5 is a tert-butyl group, R7 is a tert-Boc protection group, and R8 is<br>
hydrogen, treatment with acid in a dipolar solvent may remove both protecting<br>
groups. Amine 6 is reacted with FITC to give pteroic acid-linked FITC conjugate 8.<br>
As described herein, a wide variety of amide coupling reagents and<br>
conditions are also applicable to the synthesis described in Scheme 2, including but<br>
not limited to carboxylic acid derivatives, such as acid chlorides and the like;<br>
activated esters, such as pentafluorophenyl esters, hydroxybenzotriazole esters, and<br>
the like; coupling reagents, such as PyBOP, BOP, BOPCl, DCC, EDC, HBTU,<br>
TBTU, PyBrOP, and the like. Suitable solvents for the amide coupling steps<br>
described herein include but are not limited to DMF, DMSO, chloroform, CH2CI2,<br>
NMP, and the like. The amide coupling steps described herein may be performed at<br>
many temperatures, such as temperatures in the range from about 0 ยฐC to about 50 ยฐC,<br>
and illustratively at ambient temperature.<br>
The deprotecting steps described herein may be performed in any<br>
conventional manner, such as using the reagents and reaction conditions described in<br>
Greene &amp; Wuts. It is appreciated that the choice of deprotecting reagents and<br>
conditions is made to allow the deprotecting step to proceed without unintentionally<br>
affecting other functional groups, including other protecting groups, present on the<br>
compounds being deprotected. For example, in Scheme 2, protecting group R6 is<br>
removed in the presence of and without affecting protecting groups R5, R7, and R8. In<br>
one illustrative embodiment, protecting group R6 is a Fmoc group, and protecting<br>
group R5 is a tert-Bu ester, protecting group R7 is a tert-Boc, and R8 is hydrogen.<br>
Illustrative deprotecting agents for deprotecting base sensitive protecting groups<br>
include but are not limited to DBU, peperidine, morpholine, TBAF, and the like. The<br>
deprotecting reaction may be performed in a variety of solvents, including but not<br>
limited to water, THF, ether, DMF, NMP, CH2Cl2, EtOAc, and the like. The<br>
deprotecting reactions described herein may be performed at a variety of<br>
temperatures, such as temperatures in the range from about 0 ยฐC to about 50 ยฐC, and<br>
illustratively at ambient temperature.<br>
Coupling step (c) in Scheme 2 may be performed in similarly to that in<br>
step (a), with the coupling agents, and reaction conditions, described herein. A<br>
variety of solvents, including but not limited to THF, ether, DMF, DMSO,<br>
chloroform, CH2Cl2, NMP, and the like, and may be performed at a variety of<br><br>
temperatures, such as temperatures in the range from about 0 ยฐC to about 50 ยฐC, and<br>
illustratively at ambient temperature. Similarly, step (d) in Scheme 1 may be<br>
performed in a variety of solvents, including but not limited to THF, DMF, DMSO,<br>
chloroform, CH2Cl2, NMP, water, and the like, and may be performed at a variety of<br>
temperatures, such as temperatures in the range from about 0 ยฐC to about 50 ยฐC, and<br>
illustratively at ambient temperature. Additional bases may be added to the reaction<br>
illustrated in step (d), including but not limited to amine bases generally represented<br>
by R1R2R3N, Et3N, DIPEA, pyridine, lutidine, colliding DMAP, and the like.<br>
Deprotecting step (d) may be performed in any conventional manner.<br>
In one illustrative embodiment, protecting group R7 is a tert-Hoc group, which is<br>
chemically sensitive to acid, whereas the other protecting groups are not, such as R<br>
as a trifluoroacetyl amide, or R5 as a methyl ester, hi another illustrative embodiment,<br>
protecting group R5 is a tert-butyl ester and protecting group R7 is a tert-Boc group,<br>
which are both chemically sensitive to acid, whereas the other protecting groups are<br>
not. Illustrative deprotecting agents for deprotecting such acid sensitive protecting<br>
groups include but are not limited to TFA, HC1, HBr, AcOH, HCO2H, and the like.<br>
The deprotecting reaction may be performed in a variety of solvents, including but not<br>
limited to water, CH2Cl2, EtOAc, AcOH, and the like. It is appreciated that cation<br>
scavengers may also be included in the reaction conditions to improve the rate and/or<br>
overall yield of the deprotecting reactions, including with the use of AcOH as a<br>
solvent. The deprotecting reactions described herein may be performed at a variety of<br>
temperatures, such as temperatures in the range from about 0 ยฐC to about 50 ยฐC, and<br>
illustratively at ambient temperature.<br>
Optional deprotecting step (e) may be included in the synthesis<br>
described in Scheme 2 to remove any remaining protecting groups on the compounds<br>
8. For example, when R4 is an amide protecting group and R5 is a carboxylic acid<br>
protecting group, such groups may be removed to prepare the free amino acid<br>
derivative illustrated by compound 8. In one illustrative embodiment, coupling step<br>
(e) in Scheme 2 gives a protected form of compound 8, where R1, R2, R3, and R5 are<br>
hydrogen, and R4 is trifluoroacetyl. Protecting group R5 may be contemporaneously<br>
removed by contacting the protected compound 8 with a base, including but not<br>
limited to NH4OH, including 0.5 M NH4OH, LiOH, NaOH, KOH, K2CO3, NaHCO3,<br>
and the like, in a variety of solvents, including but not limited to water, alcohols,<br><br>
triphasic THF/water, and the like. Illustratively, the pH of the reaction conditions for<br>
removing such base sensitive protecting groups is greater than about 9. The reaction<br>
is illustratively performed at ambient temperature.<br>

coupling reagent; 2. optional deprotection of any of R1 to R5.<br>
where R1,R2,R3, and R4 are each independently hydrogen, alkyl, acyl, or a suitably<br>
selected nitrogen protecting group; R5 is hydrogen, alkyl, or a suitably selected<br>
carboxyl protecting group; R9 is hydrogen, alkyl, or a suitably selected carboxyl<br>
protecting group; m is an integer from 0-4; n is an integer from 1-4; and R6, R7, and<br><br>
R8 are each independently hydrogen or a suitably selected nitrogen protecting group.<br>
Protected allcylene diamine 16 may be prepared by either (i) reacting<br>
alkylene diamine 5 with FITC (7); (ii) reacting protected alkylene diamine 10 with<br>
FITC (7); or (iii) reacting protected aminoalkyl isothiocyanate 14 with<br><br>
fluoresceinamine (15). The amine is deprotected to give 17. Pteroic acid derivative 1<br>
is coupled with triply protected amino acid 18 to give folic acid derivative 19. The<br>
protecting groups R5 and R9 are selected so that each may be chemically removed<br>
independent of the other. Protecting group R9 is removed to give carboxylic acid 20,<br>
which is coupled to amine 17 to give conjugate 8.<br>
The reaction of isothiocyanates with amines, as illustrated in Scheme 3<br>
for the reaction of compounds 5,10,14 with compounds 7 and 15, as appropriate,<br>
may be performed in a variety of solvents, including but not limited to EtOH, MeOH,<br>
THF, CH2Cl2, DMF, CHCl3, and the like. The reactions may be performed at a<br>
variety of temperatures, such as temperatures in the range from about 0 ยฐC to about<br>
100 ยฐC, and illustratively at reflux for the solvent sued in the reaction.<br>
Similarly to the deprotecting reactions described herein, deprotecting<br>
step (c) may be performed in any conventional manner. In one illustrative<br>
embodiment, protecting group R7 is a tert-Boc group, which is chemically sensitive to<br>
acid. Illustrative deprotecting agents for deprotecting such acid sensitive protecting<br>
groups include but are not limited to TFA, HCl, HBr, AcOH, HCO2H, and the like.<br>
The deprotecting reaction may be performed in a variety of solvents, including but not<br>
limited to water, CH2Cl2, EtOAc, AcOH, and the like. It is appreciated mat cation<br>
scavengers may also be included in the reaction conditions to improve the rate and/or<br>
overall yield of the deprotecting reactions, including with the use of AcOH as a<br>
solvent. The deprotecting reactions described herein may be performed at a variety of<br>
temperatures, such as temperatures in the range from about 0 ยฐC to about 50 ยฐC, and<br>
illustratively at ambient temperature.<br>
The coupling steps (d) and (f) in Scheme 3 may be performed in<br>
similarly to that described herein, with conventional coupling agents, and reaction<br>
conditions. A variety of solvents, including but not limited to THF, ether, DMF,<br>
DMSO, chloroform, CH2Cl2, NMP, and the like, and may be performed at a variety of<br>

scavengers may also be included in the reaction conditions to improve the rate and/or<br>
overall yield of the deprotecting reactions, including with the use of AcOH as a<br>
solvent. The deprotecting reactions described herein may be performed at a variety of<br>
temperatures, such as temperatures in the range from about 0 ยฐC to about 50 ยฐC, and<br>
illustratively at ambient temperature.<br>
Optional deprotecting step (f) may be included in the synthesis<br>
described in Scheme 3 to remove any remaining protecting groups on the compounds<br>
8. For example, when R4 is an amide protecting group and R5 is a carboxylic acid<br>
protecting group, such groups may be removed to prepare the free amino acid<br>
derivative illustrated by compound 8. In one illustrative embodiment, coupling step<br>
(f) in Scheme 3 gives a protected form of compound 8, where R1, R2, and R3 are<br>
hydrogen, R4 is trifluoroacetyl, and R5 is methyl. Protecting groups R4 and R5 may be<br>

Alternatively, illustrative chemical synthesis of fluorescein conjugates<br>
of pteroic acid, and derivatives thereof, is shown in Scheme 3a.<br><br><br>

(c) amide coupling reagent.<br>
Amine 17 is coupled with protected amino acid analog 9 to give amide 21, as shown<br>
Amide 21 is deprotected to give amine 22, which is coupled with protected pteroic<br>
acid analog 1 to give vitamin-fluorescein conjugate 8.<br>
It is appreciated that the syntheses shown in Schemes 1, 2, and 3, and<br>
variations thereof, may also be used to prepare fluorescein conjugates of pteroic acid<br>
analogs, and derivatives of pteroic acid analogs, as described herein. Pteroic acid<br>
analogs, and derivatives of pteroic acid analogs, include but are not limited to folinic<br>
acid, pteropolyglutamic acid, tetrahydropterins, dihydrofolates, tetrahydrofolates,<br>
aminopterin, amethopterin, N10-methylfolate, 2-deaminohydroxyfolate, 3',5'-dichloro-<br>
4-amino-4-deoxy-N10-methylpteroylglutamic acid, and the like, as well as deaza and<br>
dideaza analogs of these compounds, such as 1-deazamethopterin, 3-<br>
deazamethopterin, and other deaza and dideaza analogs, such as 1-deaza, 3-deaza, 5-<br>
deaza, 8-deaza, and 10-deaza analogs, and 1,5-dideaza, 5,10-dideaza, 8,10-dideaza,<br>
and 5,8-dideaza analogs. For example, other analogs of folate that include one or<br>
more amino acids in addition to or in place of glutamate may be prepared according to<br>
the processes and procedures described herein. Illustratively, in Schemes 1, 2, and 3,<br>
protected forms of tyrosine, cysteine, cysteic acid, phenylalanine, lysine, and many<br>
other natural and non-natural amino acids may be substituted for the protected<br>
glutamate compounds specifically described in those Schemes. Thus, folic acid<br><br>
analogs that differ from folate by being pteroyl amides of amino acids other than<br>
glutamate are contemplated herein. Further, it is to be understood that such amides<br>
may also be prepared from pteroic acid analogs and derivatives using the syntheses<br>
and processes described herein.<br>
It is also appreciated that side products, contaminants, impurities,<br>
and/or other components may form during the preparation of the pteroic acid, folic<br>
acid, the analogs and derivatives of pteroic acid and folic acid, and conjugates of any<br>
of these compounds. These side products, contaminants, impurities, and/or other<br>
components may be removed by the purification methods described herein. In one<br>
embodiment, the other component is folic acid. In another embodiment, the other<br>
component is a bisfluorescein derivative, such as the bisfluorescein derivative. One<br>
illustrative bisfluorescein derivative is a compound of formula II<br><br>
It is also appreciated that side products, contaminants, or impurities<br>
may be avoided by selecting a suitable synthetic route, or modifying a synthetic route.<br>
In one illustrative aspect, the compound of formula II may be substantially or<br>
completely avoided by the careful elimination of water from the various synthetic<br>
methods and processes described herein. In another illustrative aspect, the compound<br>
of formula II may be avoided by using the FITC reagent in exactly one or slightly less<br>
than one molar equivalent.<br><br>
In another illustrative aspect, the compound of formula III may be<br>
substantially or completely avoided by using the alkylene diamine reagent 5, in<br>
exactly one or slightly less than one molar equivalent, as shown in Scheme 1. In<br>
another illustrative aspect, the compound of formula III may be avoided by purifying<br>
the reaction products following the introduction of the alkylene diamine reagent 5 to<br>
substantially remove any remaining alkylene diamine reagent 5 prior to the addition<br>
of FITC, such as purifying the intermediate amine 6 shown in Scheme 1 to<br>
substantially or completely remove the alkylene diamine reagent 5.<br>
In another illustrative aspect, the compound of formula III may be<br>
avoided by using a synthetic equivalent of the alkylene diamine, such as the<br>
monoprotected alkylene diamine 10, as shown in Scheme 2. In another illustrative<br>
aspect, the compound of formula III may be avoided by preparing the FITC<br>
intermediate 16, as shown in Scheme 3, prior to conjugation with the pteroic acid,<br>
folic acid, or analog or derivative of pteroic acid or folic acid. In this latter aspect, it<br>
is appreciated that the compound of formula III may be avoided by using the alkylene<br>
diamine reagent, illustratively compound 5, in exactly at least a slight excess, or<br>
illustratively a substantial excess above one molar equivalent. It is also appreciated in<br>
this latter aspect, that the product compound 16, or subsequent products, such as 17,<br>
21, or 22, when they are prepared from alkylene diamine reagent 5 may be purified to<br>
substantially or completely remove the compound of formula III.<br>
Illustratively, a conjugate of pteroic acid, or a derivative thereof, can<br>
be synthesized by any of the methods described herein in combination with<br>
purification by any of the methods described herein employing an ion-exchange<br>
chromatographic support, such as those described herein.<br>
In another embodiment, methods for purifying conjugates comprising<br>
pteroic acid or derivatives thereof, and fluorescein or derivatives thereof. In one<br>
aspect, the methods include the steps of (a) contacting a solution that includes the<br>
conjugate with a first reversed phase chromatographic support; (b) eluting a first<br>
fraction that includes a phosphate complex of the conjugate with a mobile phase,<br>
where the mobile phase includes water at a predetermined pH; (c) contacting the first<br>
fraction with a second reversed phase chromatographic support; and (d) eluting a<br>
second fraction that includes the conjugate with a mobile phase comprising water,<br>
where the second fraction is substantially free or completely free of phosphate.<br><br>
Eluting step (b) may be performed with an aqueous mobile phase prepared from water<br>
and one or more phosphate salts. The predetermined pH may be in the range from<br>
about 6 to about 8; in the range from about 7 to about 8; or in the range from about<br>
7.1 to about 7.5, or illustratively at apH of about 7.4. It is appreciated that eluting<br>
step (d) includes a mobile phase that is advantageously substantially or completely<br>
free of phosphate salts.<br>
In one aspect, the reversed-phase chromatographic support is a<br>
modified silica support including, but not limited to, a C8 silica, a C18, silica, and<br>
modified C8 and/or C18 silicas, including capped or deactivated silicas, and the like,<br>
and combinations thereof.<br>
It is appreciated that the chromatography column or columns described<br>
for use in the methods described herein may be regenerated using conventional<br>
techniques and then reused for the purification or separation of additional mixtures of<br>
pteroic acid, or analogs or derivatives thereof. Regeneration includes washing the<br>
chromatographic solid support with a solvent having a higher eluotropic index or<br>
eluotropic power than the mobile phase used for the separation. For example, a<br>
purification may include a reversed phase solid support and a mobile phase<br>
comprising water, such as pure water or an inorganic salt solution in water. The<br>
mobile phase may also include an organic solvent, such as acetonitrile (ACN),<br>
methanol, tetrahydrofuran (THF), and the like. In such an illustrative<br>
chromatographic separation, the mobile phase may be a fixed or variable mixture of<br>
water and acetonitrile, such as 90:10 water/acetonitrile, a linear gradient of 99:1 to<br>
90:10 water/acetonitrile, and the like. Subsequently, the column may be illustratively<br>
regenerated by washing with a mobile phase having a higher eluotropic index that<br>
includes a higher percentage of the organic solvent relative to the percentage of water,<br>
such as 60:40 or 50:50 water/acetonitrile. These illustrative embodiments are not<br>
limiting and any suitable mobile phase mixture for chromatographic separation and<br>
any suitable method for column regeneration may be used.<br>
In another illustrative embodiment, methods are described herein for<br>
purifying conjugates comprising pteroic acid or analogs or derivatives thereof, and<br>
fluorescein or derivatives thereof may be purified by complexation with a polyvalent<br>
cation, such as an alkaline earth metal cation. Illustrative cations include but are not<br>
limited to magnesium, calcium, beryllium, strontium, barium, and the like.<br><br>
Conventional methods are used to prepare salts such as sodium and/or potassium salts<br>
of the conjugates. Cation exchange is illustratively accomplished by mixing the<br>
sodium or potassium salt form with a polyvalent cation salt solution in a polar solvent,<br>
such as water. The polyvalent cation salt solution is prepared from conventional salts<br>
such as magnesium chloride, calcium chloride, and the like. The resulting complex is<br>
precipitated or crystallized from the polar solvent. It is appreciated that co-solvents<br>
may also be added to the polar solvent to facilitate precipitation of the polyvalent<br>
cation salts of the conjugates.<br>
Polyvalent cation salts of the conjugates may be converted back to<br>
neutral forms or other salts forms, such as sodium and potassium salts by ion<br>
exchange chromatography on a suitable conventional resin.<br>
In another illustrative embodiment, a method is provided for the<br>
therapeutic treatment of a host harboring a pathogenic cell population, such as cancer<br>
cells or pathogenic organisms. Illustratively, the method employs an isolated ligand-<br>
fluorescein conjugate capable of high affinity binding to cancer cells or other<br>
pathogenic agents. The method results in enhancement of the immune response-<br>
mediated elimination of pathogenic cell populations by rendering the pathogenic cells<br>
antigenic resulting in their recognition and elimination by the host immune system.<br>
In this method, the ligand-fluorescein conjugate is synthesized as described herein to<br>
avoid the formation of at least one bisfluorescein derivative and/or may be purified as<br>
described above to remove at least one bisfluorescein derivative.<br>
In accordance with the methods and compositions described herein, the<br>
term "isolated ligand-fluorescein conjugate" refers to a ligand-fluorescein conjugate<br>
that has been purified or manipulated to remove at least one bisfluorescein derivative,<br>
or to a ligand-fluorescein conjugate that has been synthesized to avoid the formation<br>
of at least one bisfluorescein derivative, or to both.<br>
In another illustrative embodiment, the method can utilize combination<br>
therapy by employing the isolated ligand-fluorescein conjugate, and an additional<br>
therapeutic factor capable of stimulating an endogenous immune response, a cell<br>
killing agent, a chemotherapeutic agent, a tumor penetration enhancer, a cytotoxic<br>
immune cell, or an antimicrobial agent to enhance immune response-mediated<br>
elimination of the pathogenic cell populations.<br><br>
Illustratively, the method is utilized to enhance an endogenous immune<br>
response-mediated elimination of a population of pathogenic cells in a host animal<br>
harboring the population of pathogenic cells. The method is applicable to populations<br>
of pathogenic cells that cause a variety of pathologies such as cancer and infectious<br>
diseases. Thus, the population of pathogenic cells can be a cancer cell population that<br>
is tumorigenic, including benign tumors and malignant tumors, or it can be non-<br>
tumorigenic. The cancer cell population can arise spontaneously or by such processes<br>
as mutations present in the germline of the host animal or somatic mutations, or it can<br>
be chemically-, virally-, or radiation-induced. The method can be utilized to treat<br>
such cancers as carcinomas, sarcomas, lymphomas, Hodgekin's disease, melanomas,<br>
mesotheliomas, Burkitt's lymphoma, nasopharyngeal carcinomas, leukemias, and<br>
myelomas. The cancer cell population can include, but is not limited to, oral, thyroid,<br>
endocrine, skin, gastric, esophageal, laryngeal, pancreatic, colon, bladder, bone,<br>
ovarian, cervical, uterine, breast, testicular, prostate, rectal, kidney, liver, and lung<br>
cancers.<br>
Illustratively, the population of pathogenic cells can also be an<br>
exogenous pathogen or a cell population harboring an exogenous pathogen, e.g., a<br>
virus. The method is applicable to such exogenous pathogens as bacteria, fungi,<br>
viruses, mycoplasma, and parasites. Infectious agents that can be treated with the<br>
method are any art-recognized infectious organisms that cause pathogenesis in an<br>
animal, including such organisms as bacteria that are gram-negative or gram-positive<br>
cocci or bacilli, DNA and RNA viruses, including, but not limited to, DNA viruses<br>
such as papilloma viruses, parvoviruses, adenoviruses, herpesviruses and vaccinia<br>
viruses, and RNA viruses, such as arenaviruses, coronaviruses, rhinoviruses,<br>
respiratory syncytial viruses, influenza viruses, picornaviruses, paramyxoviruses,<br>
reoviruses, retroviruses, and rhabdoviruses. Folate receptors have previously been<br>
identified on bacterial cells (Kumar et al., J. Biol. Chem.. 262, 7171-79 (1987)).<br>
Of interest are bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics such as<br>
antibiotic-resistant Streptococcus species and Staphlococcus species, or bacteria that<br>
are susceptible to antibiotics, but cause recurrent infections treated with antibiotics so<br>
that resistant organisms eventually develop. Such organisms can be treated with the<br>
isolated ligand-fluorescein conjugates in combination with lower doses of antibiotics<br>
than would normally be administered to a patient to avoid the development of these<br><br>
antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains. The method is also applicable to any fungi,<br>
mycoplasma species, parasites, or other infectious organisms that cause disease in<br>
animals. Examples of fungi that can be treated with the method of the present<br>
invention include fungi that grow as molds or are yeastlike, including, for example,<br>
fungi that cause diseases such as ringworm, histoplasmosis, blastomycosis,<br>
aspergillosis, cryptococcosis, sporotrichosis, coccidioidomycosis, paracoccidio-<br>
idomycosis, and candidiasis.<br>
The method can also be utilized to treat parasitic infections including,<br>
but not limited to, infections caused by somatic tapeworms, blood flukes, tissue<br>
roundworms, ameba, and Plasmodium, Trypanosoma, Leishmania, and Toxoplasma<br>
species. Parasites of interest are those that express folate receptors and bind folate or<br>
pteroic acid, or derivatives of folate or pteroic acid.<br>
Penicillins and cephalosporins known for their antibiotic activity and<br>
specific binding to bacterial cell wall precursors can also be used as ligands for<br>
preparing the isolated ligand-fluorescein conjugates for use in accordance with this<br>
method. The isolated ligand-fluorescein conjugates can be directed to a cell<br>
population harboring endogenous pathogens wherein pathogen-specific antigens are<br>
preferentially expressed on the surface of cells harboring the pathogens, and act as<br>
receptors for the ligand with the ligand specifically binding to the antigen.<br>
Illustratively, the method can be used for both human clinical medicine<br>
and veterinary applications. Thus, the host animals harboring the population of<br>
pathogenic organisms and treated with the isolated ligand-fluorescein conjugates can<br>
be humans or, in the case of veterinary applications, can be a laboratory, agricultural,<br>
domestic, or wild animals. The method can be applied to host animals including, but<br>
not limited to, humans, laboratory animals such rodents (e.g., mice, rats, hamsters,<br>
etc.), rabbits, monkeys, chimpanzees, domestic animals such as dogs, cats, and<br>
rabbits, agricultural animals such as cows, horses, pigs, sheep, goats, and wild<br>
animals in captivity such as bears, pandas, lions, tigers, leopards, elephants, zebras,<br>
giraffes, gorillas, dolphins, and whales.<br>
Illustratively, the isolated ligand-fluorescein conjugate is administered<br>
to the host animal parenterally, e.g., intradermally, subcutaneously, intramuscularly,<br>
intraperitoneally, or intravenously. In another embodiment, the conjugate can be<br>
administered to the host animal by other medically useful processes, and any effective<br><br>
dose and suitable therapeutic dosage form, including prolonged release dosage forms,<br>
can be used. The method can be used in combination with surgical removal of a<br>
tumor, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or biological therapies such as other<br>
immunotherapies including, but not limited to, monoclonal antibody therapy,<br>
treatment with immunomodulatory agents, adoptive transfer of immune effector cells,<br>
treatment with hematopoietic growth factors, cytokines and vaccination.<br>
Illustratively, suitable ligands include folic acid, analogs and<br>
derivatives of folic acid, and other folate receptor-binding molecules, including<br>
pteroic acid, and derivatives thereof, and other vitamins. Folate and pteroic acid<br>
derivatives include folate receptor-binding pteridines such as tetrahydropterins,<br>
dihydrofolates, tetrahydrofolates, and their deaza and dideaza analogs. The terms<br>
"deaza" and "dideaza" analogs refers to the art recognized analogs having a carbon<br>
atom substituted for one or two nitrogen atoms in the naturally occurring folic acid<br>
structure. For example, the deaza analogs include the 1-deaza, 3-deaza, 5-deaza, 8-<br>
deaza, and 10-deaza analogs. The dideaza analogs include, for example, 1,5 dideaza,<br>
5,10-dideaza, 8,10-dideaza, and 5,8-dideaza analogs. The foregoing derivatives bind<br>
to folate-receptors. Other derivatives useful in the method described herein are the<br>
folate receptor-binding analogs aminopterin, amethopterin (methotrexate), N10-<br>
methylfolate, 2-deamino-hydroxyfolate, deaza analogs such as l-deazamethopterin or<br>
3-deazamethopterin, and 3',5'-dichloro-4-amino-4-deoxy-N10-methylpteroylglutamic<br>
acid (dichloromethotrexate).<br>
Other suitable vitamins that can be used as ligands include niacin,<br>
pantothenic acid, riboflavin, thiamine, biotin, vitamin B12, and the lipid soluble<br>
vitamins A, D, E and K. (See U.S. Patent Nos. 5,108,921, 5,416,016, 5,635,382, and<br>
5,688,488 incorporated herein by reference.) These vitamins, and their receptor-<br>
binding analogs and derivatives, constitute the ligand that can be coupled with<br>
fluorescein according to the procedures described herein.<br>
Other suitable ligands include peptide ligands identified from library<br>
screens, tumor-specific peptides, tumor-specific aptamers, tumor-specific<br>
carbohydrates, tumor-specific monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies, Fab or scFv (i.e.,<br>
a single chain variable region) fragments of antibodies such as, for example, an Fab<br>
fragment of an antibody directed to EphA2 or other proteins specifically expressed or<br>
uniquely accessible on metastatic cancer cells, small organic molecules derived from<br><br>
combinatorial libraries, growth factors, such as EGF, FGF, insulin, and insulin-like<br>
growth factors, and homologous polypeptides, somatostatin and its analogs,<br>
transferrin, lipoprotein complexes, bile salts, selectins, steroid hormones, Arg-Gly-<br>
Asp containing peptides, retinoids, various Galectins, ฮณ-opioid receptor ligands,<br>
cholecystokinin A receptor ligands, ligands specific for angiotensin AT1 or AT2<br>
receptors, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ฮณ ligands, ร-lactam antibiotics,<br>
small organic molecules including antimicrobial drugs, and other molecules that bind<br>
specifically to a receptor preferentially expressed on the surface of tumor cells or on<br>
an infectious organism, or fragments of any of these molecules.<br>
Of interest in the case of ligands that bind to infectious organisms, are<br>
any molecules, such as antibiotics or other drugs, that are known in the art to<br>
preferentially bind to the microorganism. The method also applies to ligands which<br>
are molecules, such as antimicrobial drugs, designed to fit into the binding pocket of a<br>
particular receptor, based on the crystal structure of the receptor, or other cell surface<br>
protein, and wherein such receptors are preferentially expressed on the surface of<br>
tumors, bacteria, viruses, mycoplasma, fungi, parasites, or other pathogens. It is also<br>
contemplated that ligands binding to any tumor antigens or other molecules<br>
preferentially expressed on the surface of tumor cells can be utilized. The ligands<br>
should be capable of specifically eliminating a population of pathogenic cells in the<br>
host animal due to preferential expression of a receptor for the ligand, accessible for<br>
ligand binding, on the pathogenic cells. The use of combinations of isolated ligand-<br>
fluorescein conjugates to maximize elimination of the pathogenic cells is also<br>
contemplated.<br>
Illustratively, the method described herein employs fluorescein, or<br>
derivatives thereof, as the immunogen. Fluorescein, and derivatives thereof, should<br>
be capable of eliciting antibody production in the host animal or should be capable of<br>
binding to passively administered antibodies. In one illustrative embodiment, the host<br>
animal can develop a novel immunity through immunization against the unnatural<br>
antigen (i.e., fluorescein). Active immunization involves multiple injections of the<br>
unnatural antigen scheduled outside of a normal vaccination regimen to induce the<br>
novel immunity. Thus, the isolated ligand-fluorescein conjugates can be used to<br>
direct a previously acquired humoral or cellular immunity to a population of<br><br>
pathogenic cells in the host animal for elimination of the foreign cells or pathogenic<br>
organisms.<br>
In embodiments where the host animal develops a novel immunity<br>
through immunization against the unnatural antigen (i.e., fluorescein), the host animal<br>
can be preimmunized, to establish the novel immunity, with fluorescein linked to a<br>
carrier that renders fluorescein, a hapten, immunogenic. Any adjuvants known to the<br>
skilled artisan, such as Freund's adjuvant, saponin adjuvants, Alumโข (Pierce<br>
Chemical Co.), and the like, can also be administered with the carrier-fluorescein<br>
conjugate to enhance the novel immunity to fluorescein. Illustratively, carriers that<br>
can be used include keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH), haliotis tuberculata<br>
hemocyanin (HtH), inactivated diptheria toxin, inactivated tetanus toxoid, purified<br>
protein derivative (PPD) of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, bovine serum albumin<br>
(BSA), ovalbumin (OVA), g-globulins, myroglobulin, peptide antigens, and synthetic<br>
carriers, such as poly-L-lysine, dendrimer, and liposomes.<br>
The carrier (e.g., KLH or BSA) can be conjugated to fluorescein by<br>
using any art-recognized method of forming a complex. This can include covalent,<br>
ionic, or hydrogen bonding of the carrier to the fluorescein, either directly or<br>
indirectly via a linking group such as a divalent linker. The fluorescein-carrier<br>
conjugates are illustratively formed by covalent bonding through the formation of<br>
amide, ester or imino bonds between acid, aldehyde, hydroxy, amino, or hydrazo<br>
groups on the respective components of the conjugates. In embodiments where a<br>
linker is used, the linker can comprise about 1 to about 30 carbon atoms or about 2 to<br>
about 20 carbon atoms. Lower molecular weight linkers (i.e., those having an<br>
approximate molecular weight of about 20 to about 500) can be employed. Also, the<br>
linker can comprise an indirect means for associating the carrier with the fluorescein,<br>
such as by connection through intermediary linkers, spacer arms, or bridging<br>
molecules.<br>
The carrier-fluorescein conjugates can be purified to remove at least<br>
one bisfluorescein contaminant by any method known to the skilled artisan.<br>
Illustratively, an ultrafiltration step can be used to remove bisfluorescein<br>
contaminants or impurities from the carrier-fluorescein conjugates. A pharmaceutical<br>
composition comprising these carriers-fluorescein conjugates purified from<br>
bisfluorescein contaminants is contemplated.<br><br>
In another illustrative embodiment, antibodies directed against<br>
fluorescein can be administered to the host animal to establish a passive immunity.<br>
The antibodies can be natural antibodies collected from serum or monoclonal<br>
antibodies that may or may not be genetically engineered antibodies, including<br>
humanized antibodies. The utilization of a particular amount of an antibody reagent<br>
to develop a passive immunity, and the use of an isolated ligand-fluorescein conjugate<br>
wherein the passively administered antibodies are directed to fluorescein, provides the<br>
advantage of a standard set of reagents to be used in cases where a patient's induced<br>
antibody titer is not therapeutically useful. The passively administered antibodies can<br>
be "co-administered" with the isolated ligand-fluorescein conjugate and co-<br>
administration is defined as administration of antibodies at a time prior to, at the same<br>
time as, or at a time following administration of the isolated ligand-fluorescein<br>
conjugate.<br>
The isolated ligand-fluorescein conjugates enhance an endogenous<br>
immune response-mediated elimination of a population of pathogenic cells. The<br>
endogenous immune response can include a humoral response, a cell-mediated<br>
immune response, and any other immune response endogenous to the host animal,<br>
including complement-mediated cell lysis, antibody-dependent cell-mediated<br>
cytoxicity (ADCC), antibody opsonization leading to phagocytosis, clustering of<br>
receptors upon antibody binding resulting in signaling of apoptosis, antiproliferation,<br>
or differentiation, and direct immune cell recognition of the delivered hapten. It is<br>
also contemplated that the endogenous immune response will employ the secretion of<br>
cytokines that regulate such processes as the multiplication and migration of immune<br>
cells. The endogenous immune response can include the participation of such<br>
immune cell types as B cells, T cells, including helper and cytotoxic T cells,<br>
macrophages, natural killer cells, neutrophils, LAK cells and the like.<br>
It is contemplated that the induced antibodies, or passively<br>
administered antibodies will be redirected to the tumor cells or infectious organisms<br>
by preferential binding of the isolated ligand-fluorescein conjugates to these invading<br>
cells or organisms and that the pathogenic cells will be killed by complement-<br>
mediated lysis, ADCC, antibody-dependent phagocytosis, or antibody clustering of<br>
receptors. The cytotoxic process can also involve other types of immune responses,<br>
such as cell-mediated immunity, as well as secondary responses that arise when the<br><br>
attracted antigen-presenting cells phagocytose the unwanted cells and present natural<br>
tumor antigens or antigens of foreign pathogens to the immune system for elimination<br>
of the cells or organisms bearing the antigens.<br>
At least one additional composition comprising a therapeutic factor can<br>
be administered to the host in combination with the above-detailed methodology, to<br>
enhance the endogenous immune response-mediated elimination of the population of<br>
pathogenic cells, or more than one additional therapeutic factor can be administered.<br>
The therapeutic factor can be selected from a compound capable of stimulating an<br>
endogenous immune response, a chemotherapeutic agent, an antimicrobial agent, or<br>
other therapeutic factor capable of complementing the efficacy of the administered<br>
isolated ligand-fluorescein conjugate. The method described herein can be performed<br>
by administering to the host, in addition to the above-described conjugates,<br>
compounds or compositions capable of stimulating an endogenous imnrune response<br>
including, but not limited to, cytokines or immune cell growth factors such as<br>
interleukins 1-18, stem cell factor, basic FGF, EGF, G-CSF, GM-CSF, FLK-2 ligand,<br>
HILDA, MTP-1ฮฑ, TGF-ฮฑ, TGF-ฮฒ M-CSF, IFN-ฮฑ, IFN-ฮฒ IFN-ฮณ, soluble CD23, LIF,<br>
and combinations thereof.<br>
In one illustrative embodiment, therapeutically effective combinations<br>
of these cytokines can be used. Therapeutically effective combinations of these<br>
cytokines can also be used. In one embodiment, for example, therapeutically<br>
effective amounts of IL-2, for example, in amounts ranging from about 0.1<br>
MIU/m2/dose/day to about 60 MIU/m2/dose/day in a multiple dose daily regimen, and<br>
IFN-a, for example, in amounts ranging from about 0.1 MIU/m2/dose/day to about 10<br>
MIU/m2/dose/day in a multiple dose daily regimen, can be used (MIU = million<br>
international units; m2 = approximate body surface area of an average human). In<br>
another embodiment IL-12 and IFN-a are used in therapeutically effective amounts,<br>
and in yet another embodiment IL-15 and IFN-a are used in therapeutically effective<br>
amounts. In another embodiment, IL-2, IFN-a or IFN-7, and GM-CSF are used in<br>
combination. The therapeutic factor(s) used, such as IL-2, IL-12, IL-15, IFN-ฮฑ, IFN-<br>
ฮณ, and GM-CSF, including combinations thereof, can activate natural killer cells<br>
and/or T cells. Alternatively, the therapeutic factor or combinations thereof,<br>
including an interleukin in combination with an interferon and GM-CSF, can activate<br>
other immune effector cells such as macrophages, B cells, neutrophils, NK cells, NKT<br><br>
cells, T cells, LAK cells, or the like. The use of any other effective combination of<br>
cytokines including combinations of other interleukins and interferons and colony<br>
stimulating factors is also contemplated.<br>
Chemotherapeutic agents, which are cytotoxic themselves and can<br>
work to enhance tumor permeability, suitable for use in the method include<br>
adrenocorticoids, alkylating agents, antiandrogens, antiestrogens, androgens,<br>
estrogens, antimetabolites such as cytosine arabinoside, purine analogs, pyrimidine<br>
analogs, and methotrexate, busulfan, carboplatin, chlorambucil, cisplatin and other<br>
platinum compounds, tamoxiphen, taxol, cyclophosphamide, plant alkaloids,<br>
prednisone,, hydroxyurea, teniposide, antibiotics such as mitomycin C and bleomycin,<br>
nitrogen mustards, nitrosureas, vincristine, vinblastine, inflammatory and<br>
proinflammatory agents, and any other art-recognized chemotherapeutic agent. Other<br>
therapeutic agents that can be administered adjuvant to the administration of the<br>
conjugates described herein, include penicillins, cephalosporins, vancomycin,<br>
erythromycin, clindamycin, rifampin, chloramphenicol, aminoglycosides, gentamicin,<br>
amphotericin B, acyclovir, trifluridine, ganciclovir, zidovudine, amantadine, ribavirin,<br>
and any other art-recognized antimicrobial compound.<br>
In one illustrative embodiment, the elimination of the population of<br>
pathogenic cells comprises a reduction or elimination of tumor mass or of pathogenic<br>
organisms resulting in a therapeutic response. In the case of a tumor, the elimination<br>
can be an elimination of cells of the primary tumor or of cells that have metastasized<br>
or are in the process of dissociating from the primary tumor. A prophylactic<br>
treatment to prevent return of a tumor after its removal by any therapeutic approach<br>
including surgical removal of the tumor, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or<br>
biological therapy is also contemplated. The prophylactic treatment can be an initial<br>
treatment with the isolated ligand-fluorescein conjugate, such as treatment in a<br>
multiple dose daily regimen, and/or can be an additional treatment or series of<br>
treatments after an interval of days or months following the initial treatments(s).<br>
In another illustrative embodiment, pharmaceutical compositions are<br>
provided comprising an amount of an isolated ligand-fluorescein conjugate effective<br>
to "label" a population of pathogenic cells in a host animal for specific elimination by<br>
an endogenous immune response or by co-administered antibodies. In another<br>
embodiment, the composition further comprises an amount of an additional factor,<br><br>
effective to enhance the elimination of the pathogenic cells, selected from the group<br>
consisting of a cell killing agent, a tumor penetration enhancer, a chemotherapeutic<br>
agent, an antimicrobial agent, a cytotoxic immune cell, and a compound capable of<br>
stimulating an endogenous immune response. The pharmaceutical composition<br>
contains therapeutically effective amounts of the isolated ligand-fiuorescein conjugate<br>
and the therapeutic factor and the factor can comprise a cytokine such as IL-2, IL-12,<br>
or IL-15, or combinations of cytokines, including IL-2, IL-12, or IL-15 and<br>
interferons such as IFN-ฮฑ; or IFN-ฮณ and combinations of interferons, interleukins, and<br>
colony stimulating factors, such as GM-CSF.<br>
The unitary daily dosage of the isolated ligand-fiuorescein conjugate<br>
can vary significantly depending on the host condition, the disease state being treated,<br>
its route of administration and tissue distribution, and the possibility of co-usage of<br>
other therapeutic treatments such as radiation therapy. The effective amount to be<br>
administered to a patient is based on body surface area, patient weight, and physician<br>
assessment of patient condition. An effective dose can range from about 1 ng/kg to<br>
about 1 mg/kg, from about 1 ยตg/kg to about 500 ยตg/kg, or from about 1 ยตg/kg to<br>
about 100 ยตg/kg.<br>
Any effective regimen for administering the isolated ligand-fiuorescein<br>
conjugate and the therapeutic factor to redirect induced antibodies to the tumor cells<br>
or infectious organisms or to induce a humoral response to the fluorescein can be<br>
used. For example, the isolated ligand-fiuorescein conjugate and therapeutic factor<br>
can be administered as single doses, or they can be divided and administered as a<br>
multiple-dose daily regimen. Further, a staggered regimen, for example, one to three<br>
days per week can be used as an alternative to daily treatment, and such intermittent<br>
or staggered daily regimen is considered to be equivalent to every day treatment. In<br>
one embodiment, the host is treated with multiple injections of the isolated ligand-<br>
fiuorescein conjugate and the therapeutic factor to eliminate the population of<br>
pathogenic cells. In another embodiment, the host is injected multiple times<br>
(preferably about 2 up to about 50 times) with the isolated ligand-fiuorescein<br>
conjugate, for example, at 12-72 hour intervals or at 48-72 hour intervals. Additional<br>
injections of the isolated ligand-fiuorescein conjugate can be administered to the<br>
patient at an interval of days or months after the initial injections(s) and the additional<br><br>
injections can prevent recurrence of disease. Alternatively, the initial injection(s) of<br>
the isolated ligand-fluorescein conjugate may prevent recurrence of disease.<br>
Illustratively, the therapeutic factor can be administered to the host<br>
animal prior to, after, or at the same time as the isolated ligand-fluorescein conjugate<br>
and the therapeutic factor can be administered as part of the same composition<br>
containing the conjugate or as part of a different composition than the isolated ligand-<br>
fluorescein conjugate. Any such therapeutic composition containing the therapeutic<br>
factor at a therapeutically effective dose can be used in the present method.<br>
Additionally, more than one type of isolated ligand-fluorescein conjugate can be used.<br>
For example, a pteroic acid-fluorescein conjugate and a riboflavin-fluorescein<br>
conjugate can be used in combination. In the case of chemotherapeutic and<br>
antimicrobial agents, the therapeutic factor can be administered at a suboptimal dose<br>
along with the isolated ligand-fluorescein conjugate in a combination therapy to avoid<br>
development of resistance to the chemotherapeutic or antimicrobial agent by the host<br>
animal.<br>
Illustratively, the isolated ligand-fluorescein conjugate and the<br>
therapeutic factor can be injected parenterally and such injections can be<br>
intraperitoneal injections, subcutaneous injections, intramuscular injections,<br>
intravenous injections or intrathecal injections. The isolated ligand-fluorescein<br>
conjugate and the therapeutic factor can also be delivered using a slow pump.<br>
Examples of parenteral dosage forms include aqueous solutions of the active agent, in<br>
an isotonic saline, 5% glucose or other well-known pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
liquid carriers such as liquid alcohols, glycols, esters, and amides. The parenteral<br>
dosage form can be in the form of a reconstitutable lyophilizate comprising the dose<br>
of isolated ligand-fluorescein conjugate and therapeutic factor. In one aspect of the<br>
present embodiment, any of a number of prolonged release dosage forms known in<br>
the art can be administered such as, for example, the biodegradable carbohydrate<br>
matrices described in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,713,249; 5,266,333; and 5,417,982, the<br>
disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
In another illustrative embodiment, pharmaceutical compositions are<br>
provided comprising an amount of an isolated carrier-fluorescein conjugate effective<br>
to establish a novel immunity to the fluorescein moiety in the conjugate when the host<br>
animal is preimmunized with the carrier-fluorescein conjugate. The carrier-<br><br>
fluorescein conjugate can be used in any of the dosages or dosage forms described<br>
above and can be administered according to any of the regimens described above.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Unless otherwise noted, all reactions were performed at ambient<br>
temperature; all evaporations were performed under reduced pressure or in vacuo; and<br>
Example compounds were analyzed by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, elemental analysis,<br>
analytical HPLC, UV absorption, and/or fluorescence, as appropriate.<br>
EXAMPLE 1. Synthesis of compound 8a from a pteroylglutamate.<br><br>
Step (a). A solution of N10-protected pteroic acid la (119 g, 0.25 mol)<br>
and the a-tert-butyl, ฮณ-methyl diester of glutamate (2a, 76 g, 0.30 mol) in DMF (4 L)<br>
was treated with PyBop (171 g, 0.325 mol) and DEPEA (109 mL, 0.60 mol). After 18<br>
h, the mixture was evaporated giving diester 3a as a precipitate from 1:1 ACN/methyl<br>
tert-butyl ether (MTBE).<br>
Step (b). The tert-butyl protecting group of diester 3 a was<br>
chemoselectively removed with 1:1 TFA/anhydrous DCM in the presence of poly(4-<br>
vinylpyridine) to give the ฮฑ-acid, ฮณ-methyl ester analog 4 a as a precipitate from 1:1<br>
petroleum ether/MTBE.<br><br>
Step (c). A mixture of the ฮฑ-acid, ฮณ-methyl ester analog 4a and<br>
ethylene diamine (5a) was stirred for 2 h to form EDA-folate analog 6a. The N10-<br>
trifluoroacetamide protecting group was simultaneously removed during the reaction.<br>
Compound 6a may be optionally purified to remove remaining ethylene diamine (5 a)<br>
by column chromatography using a DEAE-cellulose solid support, such as DE52<br>
(Whatman Cat. No. 4057-200).<br>
Step (d). EDA-folate analog 6a was condensed with fluorescein<br>
isothiocyanate (FITC, 7) in the presence of DEPEA and 1,1,3,3-tetramethylguanidine<br>
(TMG) in DMSO, giving 8a (218 g), which was collected as a precipitate from 1:1<br>
ACN/MTBE. Folate-FITC 8a was purified by reverse phase column chromatography<br>
(Biotage C18 cartridge, 100 mM sodium phosphate buffer/acetonitrile as mobile<br>
phase). Fractions containing 8a were detected by UV absorption (280 nm) and<br>
pooled. Volatile solvents were evaporated, and the residue was desalted by reverse<br>
phase column chromatography (Biotage C18 cartridge, water/acetonitrile as mobile<br>
phase). Volatile solvents were evaporated, and the residue was lyophilized to give 47<br>
g (22% overall) of 8a. HPLC (Nova-Pale C18 column, 10 mM ammonium<br>
acetate/acetonitrile as mobile phase) indicated that the material was greater than 98%<br>
pure, and bisfluorescein derivative IIIa (n=1) was not detectable by UV or<br>
fluorescence.<br><br><br>
Step (a). A mixture of protected glutamic acid 9a and protected<br>
ethylenediamine 10a in THF was treated with PyBOP and diisopropylethylamine<br>
(DIPEA). Amide 11a was isolated by extracting the reaction mixture with EtOAc.<br>
The combined organic phase was evaporated to give amide 11a.<br>
Step (b). Amide 11a was treated with diazabicycloundecane (DBU) in<br>
methylene chloride at ambient temperature to remove the Frnoc protecting group.<br>
The mixture was evaporated to give amine 12a, which may be optionally purified.<br>
Alternatively as indicated below, steps (b)-(d) may be performed in a single operation<br>
without purification in a one-pot process.<br>
Step (c). The residue from step (b), or optionally the purified form<br>
containing amine 12a, was dissolved in DMF and coupled with N10-<br>
trifluoroacetylpteroic acid (1a) using PyBOP and DIPEA. The reaction mixture was<br>
evaporated to give folate analog 13a, which may be optionally purified. Alternatively<br>
as indicated below, steps (c)-(d) may be performed in a single operation without<br>
purification in a one-pot process.<br>
Step (d). The residue from step (c), or optionally the purified form<br>
containing folate analog 13a, was dissolved in methylene chloride and treated with<br>
trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and poly(4-vinylpyridine) as a cation scavenger to<br>
simultaneously remove the Boc and tert-hutyl protecting groups. Double<br><br>
precipitation (butyl t-butyl ether, then 1:1 methyl t-butyl ether/CH3CN) gave amine<br>
6b as a light yellow solid.<br>
Step (e). Condensation of amine 6b with fluorescein isothiocyanate<br>
(7) gave the corresponding N10-trifluoroacetamide protected analog of 8a, which was<br>
collected as a precipitate. The precipitate was dissolved in water and the pH was<br>
raised to about 10 or greater resulting in hydrolysis of the N10-trifluoroacetyl-<br>
protecting group, giving 8a.<br>
Folate-FITC 8a was purified by reverse phase HPLC (XTerra column,<br>
90:10 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer/acetonitrile as mobile phase). Fractions<br>
containing 8a were detected by UV absorption (280 nm) and pooled. Volatile<br>
solvents were evaporated. The residue was desalted by reverse phase HPLC (XTerra<br>
column, 50:50 water/acetonitrile as mobile phase). Volatile solvents were evaporated,<br>
and the residue was lyophilized to give of 8a as an orange solid.<br>
EXAMPLE 3. Synthesis of 8a from a ethylenediamineisothiocyanate.<br><br>
Step (a). A mixture of Boc-protected aminoethylisothiocyanate (14a,<br>
1.5 mmol) and fluoresceinamine (IS, Isomer-I, 0.3 mmol) in EtOH was heated at<br>
reflux for 24 h. The EtOH solvent was evaporated, the residue was dissolved in<br>
water, resulting in a pH of about 10. The aqueous layer was washed with EtOAc, and<br><br>
EXAMPLE 4. Pretreatment of DEAE cellulose anion exchange solid<br>
support.<br>
Prior to loading the DEAE cellulose anion exchange solid support (for<br>
example DE32) onto a column, the solid support was slurried into 15 volumes of a 0.5<br>
M HC1 solution. After about 0.5 hours, the supernatant was decanted away, and the<br>
solid support was washed with water until the wash had a pH of about 4. The solid<br>
support was slurried into 15 volumes of a 0.5 M NaOH solution. After about 0.5<br>
hours, the supernatant was decanted away, and the solid support was washed with<br>
water until the wash had a pH of about 8.<br>
EXAMPLE 5. Purification of pteroic acid from folic acid with DE32.<br>
Dry microgranular DE32 anion exchange resin (DEAE cellulose,<br>
Whatman Cat. No. 6055-010) was pretreated as described in Example 4. A slurry of<br>
the pretreated resin in deionized water was degassed for at least 1 hour under vacuum,<br>
uniformly packed into a glass column (25 X 900 mm), and the column was checked to<br>
minimize trapped bubbles. The column was equilibrated with the mobile phase (1.0<br>
M NaCl/0.01 M NaOH, pH 11.5). A mixture containing pteroic acid and folic acid<br>
(1.0 g) was partially dissolved in 1.0 M NaCl (1 mL) at about pH 6. The mixture<br>
completely dissolved after adjusting the pH to 11.5. The resulting solution was<br>
loaded onto the column and eluted with the mobile phase (1.0 M NaCl/0.01 M<br>
NaOH). Referring to FIG. 1 A, elution was monitored by UV absorption (280 nm). It<br>
was determined that folic acid eluted in fractions 13-31, and pteroic acid eluted in<br>
fractions 35-81. Referring to FIG. 1B, each of fractions 35-75 contained pteroic acid<br>
(greater than 99% pure) as determined by reversed phase HPLC on a Nova-Pak C18,<br>
3.9 X 150 mm column running a 99:1 to 1:1 A/B gradient at 1 mL/min where A is a 0<br>
1% TFA-H2O solution and B is a 0.1% TFA-CH3CN solution, with detection at 280<br>
nm. Fractions 35-75 were combined, and the pH of the combined fraction was<br>
adjusted to about 2 by adding 1.0 M HC1. The resulting precipitate slurry was<br>
centrifuged, and the supernatant was decanted. The residue was resupended in water,<br>
centrifuged, and the supernatant decanted (3 times). The residue was lyophilized to<br>
give 0.40 g of pteroic acid.<br>
EXAMPLE 6. Purification of pteroic acid from folic acid with DE52.<br>
Pre-swollen microgranular DE52 anion exchange resin (DEAE<br>
cellulose, Whatman Cat. No. 4057-200, 6 kg) was mixed with deionized water (12 L).<br><br>
The resulting slurry was degassed for at least 1 hour under vacuum, uniformly packed<br>
into a glass column (100 X 1200 mm), and the column was checked to minimize<br>
trapped bubbles. The column was equilibrated with the mobile phase (1.0 M NaCl,<br>
0.01 M NaOH, pH 11.5). A sample of crude pteroic acid (40 g) containing about 25%<br>
folic acid was dissolved in water (500 mL), and the pH was adjusted to 11.5 by<br>
adding a NaOH solution. The solution was filtered, loaded onto the column, and<br>
eluted with the mobile phase. Each fraction was monitored by reversed phase HPLC.<br>
The fractions containing pteroic acid in greater than about 95% purity were combined,<br>
and the pteroic acid was precipitated from the combined fractions by adjusting the pH<br>
to about 3 by adding a 1.0M HCl solution. The precipitate was lyophilized to give<br>
pteroic acid (20 g, &gt; 98% purity as determined by analytical reverse phase HPLC).<br>
The column was regenerated by eluting 2 bed volumes of the mobile<br>
phase. Columns that were stored for about a week or longer were treated with a<br>
preservative, such as a 0.2% benzalkonium chloride solution.<br>
EXAMPLE 7. Purification of a folate-fluorescein conjugate from<br>
fluorescein.<br>
Pre-swollen microgranular DE52 anion resin (DEAE cellulose,<br>
Whatman Cat. No. 4057-200,1.8 kg) was pretreated as described in. Example 6. A<br>
slurry of the pretreated resin in deionized water (4 L) was degassed for at least 1 hour<br>
under vacuum, uniformly packed into a glass column (75 X 600 mm), and the column<br>
was checked to minimize trapped bubbles. The column was equilibrated with the<br>
mobile phase (1.0 M NaCl, NaOH to pH 9.0). A sample of crude folate-fluorescein<br>
conjugate (47.9 g) containing about 10% fluorescein and other impurities was<br>
dissolved in water (600 mL), and the pH was adjusted to 9.0 by adding a 1.0 M NaOH<br>
solution. The solution was filtered, loaded onto the column, and eluted with the<br>
mobile phase. Each fraction was monitored by reversed phase HPLC. The fractions<br>
containing folate-fluorescein conjugate in greater than about 95 % purity were<br>
combined, and the folate-fluorescein conjugate was precipitated from the combined<br>
fractions by adjusting the pH to about 3 by adding a 1.0M HCl solution. The<br>
precipitates was lyophilized to give 8a (41.8 g).<br>
EXAMPLE 8. Purification of 8a by HPLC.<br>
A sample of impure 8a (4 g) was prepared as described in Example 1<br>
and purified by preparative HPLC using an XTERRA RP18, 30 x 300 mm 10 ยตm<br><br>
column (Waters) running a 100:0 to 91:9 A/B gradient over 30 min at 35 ml/min<br>
(where A was a 100 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.4) solution and B was ACN).<br>
Compound 8a eluted and was collected in fractions, while the bisfluorescein-<br>
derivative did not elute under these conditions and was not detected. Each eluted<br>
fraction was monitored by analytical reverse phase HPLC with both a UV detector<br>
and a fluorescence detector. Fractions that were greater than 98% purity by UV, did<br>
not contain any EDA-bisfluorescein or bisfluorescein impurities by UV or by<br>
fluorescence (threshold of less than 0.1%) were combined. The ACN was evaporated<br>
at a temperature less than about 35 ยฐC. The column was regenerated by eluting 1:1<br>
A/B for two or more bed volumes.<br>
The resulting solution of 8a containing phosphate salts was purified by<br>
reverse phase HPLC on a column equilibrated with 100% water for injection (WFI)<br>
by eluting with WFI for 30 min to wash out the phosphate salts, followed by a 100:0<br>
to 91:9 WF17ACN gradient over 30 min at 35 mL/min to elute 8a. Each fraction was<br>
also monitored by analytical reverse phase HPLC with both a UV detector and a<br>
fluorescence detector. Fractions with greater than 98% purity by UV and less than<br>
0.05% EDA-bisfluorescein or bisfluorescein impurities by fluorescence were pooled<br>
and lyophilized to obtain 8a as a powder.<br>
EXAMPLE 9. Effect of isolated folate-fluorescein conjugates on<br>
growth of solid tumors.<br>
Six to eight-week old (~20-22 grams) female Balb/c mice (8<br>
mice/group) were immunized subcutaneously at multiple sites with fluorescein-<br>
labeled keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) using a commercial saponin adjuvant<br>
(GPI-0100; Galenica). After assuring that anti-fluorescein antibody titers were high<br>
in all mice (as evidenced by the results of ELISA assays of serum samples of the<br>
mice), each animal was injected subcutaneously in the shoulder with 1 x 106 M109<br>
cells (a syngeneic lung cancer cell line that expresses high levels of the folate<br>
receptor; day 0) following prior immunization with KLH-fluorescein. The<br>
immunizations with folate-fluorescein after tumor cell implantation consisted of 500,<br>
2000, or 5000 nmol/lcg of folate-fluorescein, conjugated via a gamma carboxyl-linked<br>
ethylene diamine bridge, given in 19 intraperitoneal doses at 24 hour intervals (days<br>
1-19). Control animals were injected with phosphate buffered saline (PBS). A series<br>
of 5 daily injections (five times a week) for three weeks of 20,000 IU/day of<br><br>
recombinant human IL-2 were administered to all mice in order to stimulate the<br>
immune system. A series of 3 injections for three weeks of 25,000 U/day of<br>
recombinant human IFN-a were also administered to all mice. The efficacy of this<br>
immunotherapy was then evaluated by monitoring tumor volume (mm3) using a<br>
caliper. The tumor growth curves depicted in FIG. 2 show that the growth of solid<br>
tumors was significantly inhibited when animals were treated with folate-fluorescein<br>
in combination with IL-2 and IFN-a<br>
EXAMPLE 10. Purification of EDA-folate (6a) with DE52.<br>
Pre-swollen microgranular DE52 anion exchange resin (DEAE<br>
cellulose, SIGMA) was mixed with deionized water (12 L). The slurry was degassed<br>
for at least 1 h under vacuum, uniformly packed into a glass column (100 X 1200<br>
mm), and the column was checked to minimize trapped bubbles. The column was<br>
equilibrated with a NaOH solution at pH 10.5. A sample of EDA-folate 6a<br>
contaminated with ethylene diamine 5a was partially dissolved in water at neutral pH,<br>
and completely dissolved after adjusting the solution to pH 10.5 by adding a NaOH<br>
solution. After loading the pH adjusted solution, the column was first eluted with 3<br>
bed volumes of NaOH solution at pH 10.5, and then eluted with 2 bed volumes of 1.0<br>
M NaCl/NaOH solution (pH 10.5). The yellow colored fractions obtained while<br>
eluting with 1.0 M NaCl/NaOH (pH 10.5) solution were collected and combined.<br>
EDA-folate 6a was precipitated from the pooled fractions by adjusting the pH to<br>
about 7 by adding an HCl solution. After freeze drying, a small portion of 6a was<br>
coupled with fluorescein and analyzed by HPLC with a fluorescence detector. EDA-<br>
bisfluorescein compounds of formulae II and III were not detected.<br>
EXAMPLE 11. Purification of compound 8a as a calcium or<br>
magnesium salt.<br>
Treatment of 8a as a sodium salt (84% purity) with 10-50 mol<br>
equivalents of magnesium chloride or calcium chloride in water resulted in<br>
precipitation. After heating the mixture to 90-100 ยฐC, the precipitate dissolved to<br>
give a yellow solution, which was filtered, and slowly cooled to room temperature.<br>
The resulting yellow solids were filtered, washed with water, and freeze dried to give<br>
8a in 93-97% purity. The calcium or magnesium salt may be converted to the sodium<br>
salt by ion exchange.<br><br>
