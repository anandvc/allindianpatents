				<td>FAN BLADE<br>
The present invention relates to a fan blade for an<br>
axial fan with a blade body consisting of an inner<br>
inlaid part and an outer blade shaped part which<br>
partially encases said inner inlaid part and is made of<br>
a less strong materia, than the inlaid part.<br>
A fan blade of this type is known from EP 1 571 34 6 A2.<br>
In this case, the inlaid part consists of two plate-<br>
shaped individual parts which are arranged<br>
perpendicularly to each other. As a result of this<br>
embodiment of the inlaid part, the blade body must be<br>
relatively thick in order completely to enclose the<br>
inlaid part. This both gives rise to higher material<br>
costs and increases the centrifugal force of the<br>
rotating blade wheel, leading to increased loading of<br>
forces. In addition, the manufacture and preassembly of<br>
the two plate-shaped individual parts are costly.<br>
The present invention is based on the object of<br>
providing a fan blade which on the one hand allows<br>
inexpensive manufacture and assembly and is subject,<br>
almost in the shank longitudinal direction on rotation,<br>
to substantially no material lengthening.<br>
According to the invention, this is achieved in that<br>
the inlaid part is embodied as a planar metal part<br>
which is adapted substantially to the shape of the<br>
blade body and has in the fan blade base region an<br>
uncoated flat fastening portion. According to the<br>
invention, the blade shaped part is embodied as a<br>
plastics material injection-molded part. According to<br>
the invention, the fastening portion does not protrude<br>
relative to the outer fan blade contour; on the<br>
contrary, the fastening portion is integrated in the<br>
blade contour. The flat, planar embodiment of the<br>
fastening portion facilitates easy assembly of the fan<br>
 <br>
blade according to the invention with simultaneous<br>
orientation. As a result of the configuration according<br>
to the invention, a large proportion of the fan blade<br>
wheel according to the invention consists in its<br>
interior of the inlaid part itself which can be<br>
relatively thin in its embodiment; for example, it can<br>
be made of a 2 mm-thick steel sheet or of aluminum<br>
sheet. The plastics material sheathing is in this case<br>
such that a covering of the inlaid part is attained,<br>
although the plastics material volume can be kept low.<br>
Preferably, the fastening portion is arranged roughly<br>
centrally in the fan blade base region and extends<br>
directly from the edge of the base region into the<br>
blade shaped part. This allows a very uniform<br>
introduction of force into the fan blade wheel and the<br>
drive and centrifugal forces are accommodated directly<br>
by the inlaid part, as a result of which the plastics<br>
material blade shaped part is relieved in terms of<br>
force, so that said blade shaped part is not lengthened<br>
during operation.<br>
The invention further relates to a fan wheel using the<br>
fan blade according to the invention.<br>
Advantageous embodiments of the fan blade according to<br>
the invention are contained in the sub-claims and the<br>
invention will be described in greater detail with<br>
reference to the exemplary embodiments illustrated in<br>
the appended drawings, in which:<br>
Fig. 1 is a view onto a fan blade according to the<br>
invention;<br>
Fig. 2 is a view onto the fan blade according to Fig.<br>
1, but in a longitudinal section above the inlaid part;<br>
Fig. 3 is an individual view of the inlaid part<br>
according to Fig. 2;<br>
 <br>
Fig. 4 is a side view of an inlaid part according to<br>
the invention;<br>
Fig. 5 is a view of a fan wheel according to the<br>
invention; and<br>
Fig. 6 is an individual view of a fan wheel according<br>
to Fig. 5.<br>
A fan blade according to the invention consists of a<br>
blade body 1 which is formed from an inlaid part 3 and<br>
an outer blade shaped part 2 partially encasing said<br>
inlaid part. The inlaid part 3 is embedded in the blade<br>
shaped part 2 and completely enclosed apart from its<br>
uncoated fastening portion 4. The blade shaped part 2<br>
is preferably manufactured as a plastics material<br>
sprayed part and the inlaid part 3 is simultaneously<br>
sheathed during the process of spraying the plastics<br>
material sprayed part. The plastics material used is in<br>
particular a polyamide plastics material or<br>
polypropylene or polybutylene terephthalate (PBT).<br>
According to the invention, it can be expedient if the<br>
inlaid part 3 is provided with a primer layer as an<br>
adhesion promoter prior to the sheathing. As may be<br>
seen from Fig. 1, the fastening portion 4 remains<br>
uncoated so that the inlaid part 3, which is made of<br>
sheet metal, can be fastened here so as to abut<br>
directly against a fastening flange of a hub of a fan<br>
wheel. For fastening, the fastening portion 4 has a<br>
hole 5 through which the required fastening screw 26<br>
can be fed. Also formed in the fastening portion 4 are<br>
alignment recesses 6 into which adapted projections 24<br>
on the fastening flemge 22 of the fan hub 21 fit (see<br>
Fig. 5 and 6) . The fastening portion 4 is embodied so<br>
as to be flat and planar, thus allowing abutment<br>
against the corresponding fastening flange over the<br>
entire area. As may be seen from Fig. 1 and 2, the<br>
 <br>
fastening portion 4 is arranged roughly centrally in<br>
the fan blade base region 7 and extends directly from<br>
the edge 8 of the basse region 7 into the blade shaped<br>
part 2. The inlaid part 3 thus does not protrude with<br>
its fastening portion 4 beyond the edge 8, but rather<br>
is integrated within the blade shaped part 2. As may be<br>
seen in particular from Fig. 4, the inlaid part 3 is<br>
embodied, starting from the fastening portion 4, as an<br>
arched shaped part. In this case, arching is present<br>
both in the direction of the longitudinal axis Y-Y and<br>
in the direction of the transverse axis X-X. The fan<br>
blade according to the invention also has corresponding<br>
arching. As the fastening portion 4 is embodied in a<br>
flat manner, said fastening portion is comprised by a<br>
transition region 10 which is arched in the opposite<br>
direction. The figure also reveals that the inlaid part<br>
3 has two stiffening ribs 12 in the illustrated<br>
exemplary embodiment. These stiffening ribs 12 run in a<br>
spoke-like manner from the circumference of the<br>
fastening portion 4 in the direction of the<br>
longitudinal extension or of the longitudinal axis Y-Y<br>
of the blade body 1 or of the inlaid part 3. These<br>
stiffening ribs 12 are impressed into the material of<br>
the inlaid part 3. Advartageously, the inlaid part 3 is<br>
made of a steel sheet or an aluminum sheet having a<br>
thickness of for example 2 mm. It may also be seen that<br>
the inlaid part 3 has a plurality of apertures 13 which<br>
are formed in its surface and can be embodied in<br>
particular in a circular or else elliptical manner. The<br>
plastics material can pass through these apertures 13<br>
during the sheathing of the blade shaped part 2 with<br>
the plastics material, so that the plastics material is<br>
through-connected on both sides of the inlaid part 3.<br>
The distribution of the apertures 13 is such that	the<br>
plurality of apertures 13 are arranged between the	end<br>
of the stiffening ribs 12 and the base portion 7 of	the<br>
end opposing the blade shaped part 2 and also in	the<br>
 <br>
direction of rotation of the fan blade wheel or of the<br>
fan blade in the region between the stiffening ribs 12<br>
and the respective rear longitudinal edge 11 of the fan<br>
blade. Thus, the apertures 13 are arranged in such a<br>
way and at locations such that they are present in the<br>
regions and ensure through-connection of the plastics<br>
material where the greatest plastics material overlap<br>
is present. Apertures 13 are also formed in the<br>
immediate vicinity of the transition portion 10. If the<br>
stiffening ribs 12 are also completely enclosed by the<br>
plastics material of the blade shaped part 2, a form-<br>
fitting and force-transmitting connection . is<br>
established here too between, the two bodies.<br>
Fig. 2 shows that the shape of the inlaid part 3 and<br>
the shape of the blade body 1 are adapted in such a way<br>
that the delimiting edges of the blade body 1 and of<br>
the inlaid part 3 coincide in the base region 7 and the<br>
two opposing delimiting edges in the longitudinal<br>
direction Y-Y of the inla.id part 3 and also the<br>
corresponding delimiting edges of the blade body 1 run<br>
relative to one another in such a way that an extending<br>
gap region is present between these edges, starting<br>
from the base region 7. In this case, the gap region 14<br>
is embodied so as to be very much larger in the region<br>
of the, in the direction of rotation, rear delimiting<br>
edges 11, 11a than the gap region 15 of the, in the<br>
direction of rotation, front longitudinal edges 11b,<br>
11c, i.e. only a small overlap of the blade shaped part<br>
2 relative to the inlaid part 3 is present in the, in<br>
the direction of rotation, front region of the blade<br>
body. Expediently, the inlaid part 3 has a maximum<br>
length 1 which is about 60 % to 85 %, preferably<br>
approx. 75% to 80% of the maximum length L of the<br>
blade body 1. Furthermore, the inlaid part 3 has a<br>
maximum width b which is 35 % to 60 %, preferably 38 %<br>
to 53 % of the maximum width B of the blade body 1.<br>
 <br>
The invention thus provides an adaptation of the inlaid<br>
part 3 and blade shaped part 2 leading to optimum<br>
distribution of force within the fan blade, so that<br>
changes in length of the fan blade shaped part 2 are<br>
avoided.<br>
A fan wheel 20 according to the invention consists of a<br>
hollow cylindrical hub 21 on the circumference of which<br>
fastening flanges 22 are embodied. The fan blades<br>
according to the invention are fastened to these<br>
fastening flanges 22. The hub 21 is made of diecast<br>
aluminum or of steel and can form the rotor of a DC<br>
motor. The fastening portion 4 of the fan blades<br>
according to the invention is fastened to the fastening<br>
flanges 22. In the case of a diecast aluminum rotor,<br>
the fastening flanges 22 can be cast onto the rotor.<br>
If, on the other hand,, the rotor is, as illustrated in<br>
Fig. 5 and 6, made of steel, then the fastening flanges<br>
22 are welded onto the hub 21 over the circumference.<br>
The fastening flanges 22 can expediently be<br>
manufactured as punched parts or punched bent parts.<br>
Owing to the fastening according to the invention by<br>
welding-on of the fastening flanges 22, the size and<br>
orientation of the blade shaped parts 2 can be varied<br>
in any desired manner, The fastening flanges 22 can be<br>
embodied as a sheet steel punched bent part consisting<br>
of a central abutment portion 27 having in each case<br>
stiffening webs 29 which are bent over at its<br>
longitudinal sides 28. The stiffening webs 29 have a<br>
substantially triangular shape, the stiffening webs 29<br>
tapering toward the free end of the abutment portions<br>
27. This produces an embodiment of the fastening<br>
flanges 22 that is U-shaped in cross section, in<br>
particular in the lower fastening region, where they<br>
are welded onto the hub 21.<br>
The invention is not restricted to the illustrated and<br>
described exemplary embodiments, but rather includes<br>
 <br>
all embodiments which are equivalent in the sense of<br>
the invention. Furthermore, the invention is also far<br>
from being restricted to the combination of features<br>
defined in claim 1, but rather can also be defined by<br>
any other desired combination of specific features of<br>
all individual features disclosed as a whole. This<br>
means that in principle almost any individual feature<br>
of claim 1 may be omitted or replaced by at least one<br>
individual feature disclosed at a different point of<br>
the application. To this extent, claim 1 should be<br>
understood merely as a first attempt to formulate an<br>
invention.<br>
