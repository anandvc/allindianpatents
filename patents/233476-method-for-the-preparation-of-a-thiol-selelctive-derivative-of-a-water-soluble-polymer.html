				<td>The present invention relates to method for the preparation of a thiol-selective derivative of a water soluble polymer<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a method for preparing thiol-selective derivatives of a<br>
water-soluble polymer such as polyethylene glycol. In particular, theinvention relates to; (i) a<br>
method for preparing polymers having a thiol, protected thiol, or other group suitable for<br>
coupling to the thiol group of a protein or other active agent at at least one tenninus, (ii) the thiol-<br>
selective polymers themselves, (iii) conjugates thereof, and (iv) methods for utilizing such<br>
polymers.	<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Due to recent advances in biotechnology, therapeutic proteins and other biomolecules, e.g. antibodies and antibody fragments, can now be prepared on a large scale, making such biomolecules more widely available. Unfortunately, the clinical usefulness of potential therapeutic biomolecules is often hampered by their rapid proteolytic degradation, instability upon manufacture, storage or administration, or by their immunogenicity.   Due to the continued interest in administering proteins and other biomolecules for therapeutic use, various approaches to overcoming these deficiencies have been explored.<br>
One such approach which has been widely explored is the modification of proteins and other potentially therapeutic biomolecules by covalent attachment of a water-soluble polymer such as polyethylene glycol or 'TEG" (Abuchowski, A., etal, J. BiolChem. 252(11), 3579 (1977); Davis, S., et al, Clin.Exp Immunol, 46,649-652 (1981). The biological properties of PEG-modified proteins , also referred to as PEG-conjugates or pegylated proteins, have been shown, in many cases, to be considerably improved over those of their non-pegylated counteiparts (Hennan, et al, Macromol Chem. Phys., 195,203-209 (1994). Polyethylene glycol-modiGed proteins have been shown to possess longer circulatory times in the body due to increased resistance to proteolytic degradation, and also to possess increased diermosfability (Abuchowski, A., etal., J. Biol. Chem., 151,3582-3586 (1977). A similar increase in bioefficacy<br><br>
is observed with other biomolecules, e.g. antibodies and antibody fragments (Chapman, A., Adv. Drug Del.Rev. 54, 531-545 (2002)).<br>
Typically, attachment of polyethylene glycol to a drug or other surface is accomplished using an activated PEG derivative, that is to say, a PEG having at least one activated terminus suitable for reaction with a nucleophilic center of a biomolecule (e.g., lysine, cysteine and similar residues of proteins). Most commonly employed are methods based upon the reaction of an activated PEG with protein amino groups, such as those present in the lysine side chains of proteins. Polyethylene glycol having activated end groups suitable for reaction with the amino groups of proteins include PEG-aldehydes (Harris, J. M., Herati, R.S., Polym Prepr. (Am. Chem. Soc, Div. Polym. Chem), 32(1), 154-155 (1991), mixed anhydrides, N-hydroxysuccinimide esters, carbonylimadazolides, and chlorocyanurates (Herman, S., et al., Macromol. Chem. Phys. 195,203-209 (1994)). Although many proteins have been shown to retain activity during PEG modification, in some instances, polymer attachment through protein amino groups can be undesirable, such as when derivatization of specific lysine residues inactivates the protein (Suzuki, T., et al., Biochimica et Biophysica Acta 788, 248-255 (1984)). Therefore, it would be advantageous to have additional methods for the modification of a protein by PEG using another target amino acid for attachment, such as cysteine. Attachment to protein thiol groups on : cysteine may offer an advantage in that cysteines are typically less abundant in proteins than lysines, thus reducing the likelihood of protein deactivation upon conjugation to these thiol-containing amino acids.<br>
Polyethylene glycol derivatives having a thiol-selective reactive end group include maleimides, vinyl sulfones, iodoacetamides, thiols, and disulfides. These derivatives have all been used for coupling to the cysteine side chains of proteins (Zalipsky, S. Bioconjug. Chem. 6, 150-165 (1995); Greenwald, R. B. et al. Crit. Rev. Ther. Drug Carrier Syst. 17,101-161 (2000); Herman, S., etal, Macromol. Chem. Phys. 195,203-209 (1994)). However, many of these reagents have not been widely exploited due to the difficulty in their synthesis and purification. For instance, the method of Woghiren, et al. (Woghiren, C, et al, Bioconjugate Chem., 4, 314-318 (1993)) requires a series of synthetic transformation and purification steps to form a particular thiol-protected PEG reagent. First, methoxy-PEG is reacted with tosyl chloride followed by a purification of the reaction product to recover the corresponding tosyl-PEG. Tosyl-PEG is then converted to the corresponding PEG-thioacetate by reaction with a thioacetate salt, followed by another purification step. Alcoholysis with methanol is then carried out on the<br><br>
PEG-thioacetate, followed by column chromatography to yield the purified thiolate salt, which is then reduced with dithiothreitol to form the corresponding PEG-thioI. The resulting PEG thiol is then purified by column chromatography. A protected form of the thiol is then prepared by reaction of the PEG-thiol with 4,4'-dipyridyl disulfide, followed by purification by colunm chromatography. In sum, Woghiren's methodology for transforming PEG to its thiol-protected form requires five different reaction steps and an additional five separate purification steps, making this and other similar synthetic approaches undesirable and extremely time-consuming.<br>
Another significant deficiency in many of the existing routes to monofunctional thiol specific PEG derivatives is the inability, despite multiple purification steps, to remove difunctionalized PEG which arises from the diol that is present in the monofunctional PEG raw material.<br>
Thus, there exists a need for a method for preparing high purity, activated PEG-thiols and other thiol-selective PEG derivatives that is both straightforward and simple, i.e., requiring a minimum number of reaction and purification steps, whilst maintaining the integrity of the PEG segment (i.e., is carried out under mild reaction conditions), and which can further provide high purity thiol-selective PEG derivatives in high yields. Such a method has been developed by the Applicants, to be described in greater detail below.<br>

wherein the molecular mass of the water-soluble polymer segment is from 1,000 Daltons to 50,000 Daltons.<br>
DEFINITIONS<br>
The following terms as used herein have the meanings indicated. As used in the 15 specification, and in the appended claims, the singular forms 'a", "an", "the", include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise.<br>
"Thiol selective derivative", in the context of a polymer of the invention, means a polymer having at least one terminus that is a thiol-reactive group. Preferentially, a thiol selective group is one that reacts preferentially with thiol groups. A thiol-selective polymer of the invention will preferably be fairly selective for thiol groups under certain reaction conditions. Exemplary thiol-selective groups include maleimide, vinyl sulfone, orthopolyridyl disulfide, iodoacetamide, thiol (-SH), thiolate (-5), or protected thiol, that is to say, a thiol group in its protected form. Typical thiol protecting groups include thioether, thioester, or disulfide. Exemplary protecting groups for thiols can be found in Greene, T., and Wuts, Peter G.M.,<br>
"PROTECTIVE GROUPS IN ORGANIC SYNTHESIS, Chapter 6, 3rd Edition, John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York, 1999 (p. 454-493).<br>
"Activated carboxylic acid" or "activated carboxylic acid derivative" means a functional derivative of a carboxylic acid that is more reactive than the parent carboxylic acid, in particular, with respect to nucleophilic acyl substitution. Activated carboxylic acids .include but are not limited to acid halides (such as acid chlorides), anhydrides, amides and esters.<br>
"PEG' or "poly (ethylene glycol)" as used herein, is meant to encompass any water- soluble poly(ethylene oxide). Typically, PEGs for use in the present invention will comprise one<br><br>
of the two following structures: "-(CH2CH2O)-N-" or "-(CH2CH2O)n-1CH2CH2-," depending upon whether or not the terminal oxygen(s) has been displaced, e.g., during a synthetic transformation. The variable (n) ranges from 3 to 4000, and the terminal groups and architecture of the overall PEG may vary. When PEG further comprises a linker moiety,,(to be described in greater detail below), the atoms comprising the linker, when covalently attached to a PEG segment, do not result in formation of (i) an oxygen-oxygen bond (-O-O-, a peroxide linkage), or (ii) a nitrogen-oxygen bond (N-O, O-N). "PEG" means a polymer that contains a majority, that is to say, greater than 50%, of subunits that are -CH2CH2O-. PEGs for use in the invention include PEGs having a variety of molecular weights, structures or geometries (e.g., branched, linear, forked PEGs, dendritic, and the like), to be described in greater detail below.<br>
"PEG diol", also known as alpha-,omega-dihydroxylpoly(ethylene glycol), can be represented in brief form as HO-PEG-OH, where PEG is as defined above.<br>
"Water-soluble", in the context of a polymer of the invention or a "water-soluble polymer segment" is any segment or polymer that is soluble in water at room temperature. Typically, a water-soluble polymer or segment will transmit at least about 75%, more preferably at least about 95% of light, transmitted by the same solution after filtering. On a weight basis, a water-soluble polymer or segment thereof will preferably be at least about 35% (by weight) soluble in water, more preferably at least about 50% (by weight) soluble in water, still more preferably about 70% (by weight) soluble in water, and still more preferably about 85% (by weight) soluble in water. It is most preferred, however, that the water-soluble polymer or segment is about 95% (by weight) soluble in water or completely soluble in water.<br>
An "end-capping" or "end-capped" group is an inert or non-reactive group present on a terminus of a polymer such as PEG. An end-capping group is one that does not readily undergo chemical transformation under typical synthetic reaction conditions. An end capping group is generally an alkoxy group, -OR, where R is an organic radical comprised of 1-20 carbons and is preferably lower alkyl (e.g., methyl, ethyl) or benzyl.   "R" may be saturated or unsaturated, and includes aryl, heteroaryl, cyclo, heterocyclo, and substituted forms of any of the foregoing. For instance, an end capped PEG will typically comprise the structure "RO-(CH2CH2O)nCH2CH2-", where R is as defined above. Alternatively, the end-capping group can also advantageously comprise a detectable label. When the polymer has an end-capping group comprising a detectable label, the amount or location of the polymer and/or the moiety (e.g., active agent) to<br><br>
which the polymer is coupled, can be determined by using a suitable detector. Such labels include, without limitation, fluorescers, chemiluminescers, moieties used in enzyme labeling, colorimetric (e.g., dyes), metal ions, radioactive moieties, and the like. The end-capping group can also advantageously comprise a phospholipid. When the polymer has an end-capping group such as a phospholipid, unique properties (such as the ability to form organized structures with similarly end-capped polymers) are imparted to the polymer. Exemplary phospholipids include, without limitation, those selected from the class of phospholipids called phosphatidylcholines. Specific phospholipids include, without limitation, those selected from the group consisting of dilauroylphosphatidylcholine, dioleylphosphatidylcholine, dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine, disteroylphosphatidylcholine, behenoylphosphatidylchobne, arachidoylphosphatidylcholine, and lecithin.<br>

METHOD FOR PREPARING THIOL-SELECTIVE DERIVATIVES OF WATER SOLUBLE POLYMERS<br>
OVER VIEW OF THE METHOD<br>
The present invention provides a method for preparing water-soluble polymer derivatives suitable for reaction with thiol groups on proteins or on other active agents. In the method, a water soluble polymer segment having at least one reactive electrophilic terminus is reacted witk a bifunctional reactant molecule (that is to say, a reactant molecule possessing at least two<br><br>
functional groups as described below) that contains both a nucleophile (for reaction with the electrophilic terminus of the polymer) and a thiol-selective moiety. Representative thiol selective moieties include thiol, protected thiol, disulfide, maleimide, organomercurials, alpha-haloacetyl compounds such as iodoacetamide, vinyl sulfones, aryl halides, diazoacetates, and orthopyridyl disulfide. The reaction is carried out under conditions effective to promote reaction between the electrophilic terminus of the polymer and the nucleophilic group of the reactant molecule, to form a covalent attachment between the polymer and the reactant molecule. The reaction results in the formation of an activated polymer having a terminus that is selective for reaction with a thiol (e.g., thiol, protected thiol, disulfide, maleimide, vinyl sulfone, iodoacetamide or orthopyridyl disulfide), depending upon the particular reactant molecule employed. A generalized reaction scheme is presented below.<br>

(Scheme Removed)<br>
where R.A. is a reducing agent, and Z, POLY, L, Y, X, NU are as defined herein.<br>
(Scheme Removed)<br><br>
where A is an active agent.<br>
In its most simplified form, the method can provide activated polyethylene glycol derivatives having a thiol-selective terminus (e.g., a thiol, protected thiol, or maleimide) in one<br><br>
reaction step. In instances in which the reactant molecule possesses a nucleophile that competes with the thiol-selective moiety for reaction with the electrophilic terminus of the polymer, for example when the nucleophile is an amino group and the sulfur containing moiety is a thiol or a thiolate, such as in the exemplary reactant, cysteamine, protection of the thiol group on the reactant molecule may be necessary to prevent reaction of the polymer at the thiol-center of the reactant. Alternatively, if the rates of reaction of the two competing moieties are significantly different, the reaction may be carried out under conditions where the nucleophilic center of the reactant molecule is selectively or preferentially reacted with the electrophile of the polymer. Undesired reaction products resulting from the reaction between the thiol or thiolate and the given electrophile can then be removed by additional purification/separation steps.<br>
A detailed description regarding suitable electrophilically activated polymers and molecular reactants is provided in the sections that follow.<br>
In one preferred embodiment, the reactant molecule is a symmetrical disulfide having two identical nucleophilic groups for reaction with the electrophilic group of the polymer. This approach is advantageous because no competition exists between potentially different nucleophiles in the reactant molecule. Thus, under suitable reaction conditions (e.g., when an at least a two fold molar excess of electrophilically activated polymer is employed - sufficient to 'react with all of the nucleophile groups in the symmetrical disulfide), only one activated polymer product is formed.<br>
Exemplary symmetrical reactant molecules will possess a central disulfide (-S-S-) bond where the sulfur atoms are each connected to identical Y groups such as alkylene, substituted alkylene, cycloalkylene, substituted cycloalkylene, aryl, or substituted aryl group possessing i nucleophile (NU) such as an amino, hydroxy, thiol, imino, thioester or the like covalently attached thereto, "(NU-Y-S)2". One such preferred symmetrical reactant molecule is cystamiie. Reaction of an electrophilically activated polymer with a symmetrical disulfide reagent such s cystamine results in formation of a symmetrical disulfide polymer having identical polymer segments extending from each of the sulfur atoms of a central disulfide linkage. Illustrative reactions carried out with different electrophilically activated polymers and the reactant, cystamine, are provided in the Examples (Examples 1-3). The electrophifically-activated polymer is typically reacted with a bi-functional reactant molecule under very mild reaction conditions (e.g., room temperature), offering another advantage of this approach.  Moreover,<br><br>
typical yields are greater than 70%, preferably greater than 80%, more preferably greater than 90%, and often even greater than 95%.<br>
Due to the symmetry of the resulting disulfide polymer, cleavage by action of a reducing agent such as dithiothreitol results in formation of two moles of the corresponding thiol-selective polymer derivative ("POLY-S").<br>
Preferred polymers (POLY-E's) for use in the present invention include methoxy-PEG propanoic acid and methoxy-PEG butanoic acid and activated forms thereof. Particularly preferred polymer derivatives having a thiol selective teminus are provided in structures (11), (13), and (18) described herein.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the polymer derivatives of the invention are prepared from polymer acid or polymer acid-equivalent starting materials, where the polymer acid is purified prior to the reaction with the nucleophile. A polymer acid or polymer acid equivalent is a water soluble polymer of the invention having at least one functional group or terminus that is a carboxylic acid or a carboxylic acid-equivalent such as an activated derivative of a carboxylic acid. The use or preparation of a polymer acid provides an additional advantage in that it allows for the ready removal of PEG diol or PEG diol-derived impurities that may be present in the polymer starting material, depending upon its source.<br>
Often, polyethylene glycol starting materials, such as electrophilically activated PEG, as used in many embodiments of the invention, contain detectable amounts of PEG diol impurity, often ranging from 0.5% to over 30% by weight. Any amount of diol impurity can be a problem, since the diol (and its reaction products) can be extremely difficult to remove/separate. Additionally, due to its reactivity, PEG-diol (and more particularly its conversion products) can react with a bioactive agent during a coupling reaction, resulting in the formation of a mixture of conjugate products. The resulting mixture of conjugates can be difficult to analyze, i.e., to determine the extent of diol-derived impurities present. Moreover, separation of the desired conjugate product from the diol-derived conjugate products can be extremely difficult, and in some instances, may be impossible to achieve.   In particular, high molecular weight water soluble polymers such as methoxy-PEG-OH (e.g., having a molecular weight of greater than about 30,000 daltons) can contain up to 30 percent by weight or more diol, depending upon the source and/or the method of making the PEG starting material. As discussed above, such diol and diol-derived impurities can be especially problematic when carried through a series of synthetic transformations and/or a conjugation reaction. The use of a polymer acid, such as in<br><br>
method of the invention, allows for the purification, e.g., by chromatography, of the POLY-E starting material (or its equivalent precursor) and the ultimate formation of a thiol-selective polymer formulation that is essentially free of reactive PEG-diol or reactive PEG-diol derived impurities.<br>
The applicants have recognized that separation of PEG-diol-related impurities at the front end of a reaction or series of reactions leading to the formation of a reactive polymer derivative or eventually a polymer conjugate is advantageous, since separation/purification at this stage is more readily accomplished when compared to the separation of various polymer conjugate species.<br>
Alternatively, as an approach for removing or rendering inert mPEG-diol derived impurities, the water-soluble polymer provided in step (i), POLY-E, may be prepared from a diol-free PEG-OH prepared from benzyloxy-PEG as described in co-owned U.S. Patent No. 6,448,369. In this approach, the benzyloxy-PEG-OH starting material is prepared preferentially by polymerization of ethylene oxide onto the benzyloxide ion, Bz-O', resulting in high purity monofunctional benzyloxy PEGs containing PEG-diol. After converting all PEG-OH groups to inert methyl ethers and removing benzyloxy groups in subsequent steps, the method provides pure, diol-free methoxy-PEG-OH. In utilizing this method, PEG-diol is converted to its non-reactive ether form, rendering it an inert component of the resulting composition.<br>
In sum, the method provided herein (i) avoids multiple cumbersome reaction steps, (ii) does not necessarily require multiple protecting/deprotecting steps, (iii) is carried out under mild conditions such that the polymer segment is not particularly susceptible to damage, (iv) results in a high yields of product, typically greater than 90%, and (v) provides a new class of polymer derivatives having a thiol-selective terminus. The overall synthetic methodology, reagents, polymer derivatives, compositions, and conjugates of the invention will now be described more fully below.<br>
POLYMER REACTANTS, POLY-L0,1-E<br>
The Polvmer Segment. POLY<br>
The following describes the polymer segment designated herein as POLY, applicable to the electrophihcally activated polymers of the method, as well as the thiol-selective polymers of the invention. Electrophilically-activated polymer derivatives useful in the present invention generally comprise at least one electrophile coupled to a water soluble polymer segment. The<br><br>
electrophile can either be covalently bonded directly to the polymer segment, or alternatively can be coupled to the polymer backbone via a linking group, L.<br>
Representative POLYs include poly(alkylene glycols) such as poly(ethylene glycol), poly(propylene glycol) ("PPG"), copolymers of ethylene glycol and propylene glycol, poly(olefmic alcohol), poly(vinylpyrrolidone), poly(hydroxyalkylmethacrylamide), poly(hydroxyalkylmethacrylate), poly(saccharides), poly(α-hydroxy acid), poly(vinyl alcohol), polyphosphazene, polyoxazoline,and poly(N-acryIoylmorpholine). POLY can be a homopolymer, an alternating copolymer, a random copolymer, a block copolymer, an alternating tripolymer, a random tripolymer, or a block tripolymer of any of the above. The water-soluble polymer segment is preferably, although not necessarily, a poly(ethylene glycol) "PEG" or a derivative thereof.<br>
The polymer segment can have any of a number of different geometries, for example, POLY can be linear, branched, or forked. Most typically, POLY is linear or is branched, for example, having 2 polymer arms. Although much of the discussion herein is focused upon PEG as an illustrative POLY, the discussion and structures presented herein can be readily extended to encompass any of the water-soluble polymer segments described above.<br>
Any water-soluble polymer having at least one electrophilically activated terminus can be used to prepare a thiol-selective polymer in accordance with the method of the invention. Although water-soluble polymers bearing only a single reactive electrophilically activated terminus are typically used and illustrated herein, polymers bearing two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve or more reactive termini suitable for conversion to a thiol selective polymer as set forth herein can be used. Advantageously, as the number of hydroxyl or other reactive moieties on the water-polymer segment increases, the number of available sites for introducing an electrophilic group increases.  Non-limiting examples of the upper limit of the number of hydroxyl and/or electrophilic moieties associated with the water-soluble polymer segment include from about 1 to about 500, from 1 to about 100, from about 1 to about 80, from about 1 to about 40, from about 1 to about 20, and from about 1 to about 10.<br>

POLY can be end-capped, where PEG is terminally capped with an inert end-capping group. Preferred end-capped PEGs are those having as an end-capping moiety such as alkoxy, substituted alkoxy, alkenyloxy, substituted alkenyloxy, alkynyloxy, substituted alkynyloxy, aryloxy, substituted aryloxy. Preferred end-capping groups are C1-C20 alkoxy such as methoxy, ethoxy, and benzyloxy. The end-capping group can also advantageously comprise a phospholipid.  Exemplary phospholipids include phosphatidylcholines, such as dilauroylphosphatidylcholine, dioleylphosphatidylcholine, dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine, disteroylphosphatidylcholine, behenoylphosphatidylcholine, arachidoylphosphatidylcholine, and lecithin.<br>
Referring now to any of the structures comprising a polymer segment, POLY, POLY may correspond or comprise the following:<br>
"Z-(CH2CH2O)„-"   or     "Z-(CH2CH2O)„-CH2CH2-",<br>
where n ranges from about 3 to about 4000, or from about 10 to about 4000, and Z is or includes a functional group, which may be a reactive group or an end-capping group. Examples of Z include hydroxy, amino, ester, carbonate, aldehyde, acetal, aldehyde hydrate, ketone, ketal, ketone hydrate, alkenyl, acrylate, methacrylate, acrylamide, sulfone, thiol, carboxylic acid, isocyanate, isothiocyanate, hydrazide, urea, maleimide, vinylsulfone, dithiopyridine, vinylpyridine, iodoacetamide, alkoxy, benzyloxy, silane, lipid, phospholipid, biotin, and fluorescein, including activated and protected forms thereof where applicable.

The polymer reactant (and corresponding product) may possess a dumbbell-Uke or bifunctional linear structure, e.g., in which two electrophiles are interconnected by a central POLY, e.g., PEG. More specifically, such POLY may be represented by the structure El-PEG-E2, where El and E2 are independently selected electrophiles as described herein. Preferably, El and E2 are the same. Exemplary PEGs falling into this classification are provided in Example<br><br>

Branched PEGs such as these for use in the present invention will typically have fewer than 4 PEG arms, and more preferably, will have 2 or 3 PEG arms. Such branched PEGs offer the advantage of having a single reactive site, coupled with a larger, more dense polymer cloud than their linear PEG counterparts. Illustrative branched polymers bearing electrophilic groups such as these are commercially available from Nektar (Huntsville, Alabama), and include mPEG2-N-hydroxysuccinimide.<br>
An illustrative branched polymer reactant and corresponding thiol-selective polymer of the invention, respectively, have the structures shown below:<br><br>

Branched polymers for use in preparing a polymer of the invention additionally include those represented more generally by the formula R(POLY)n, where R is a central or core molecule from which extends 2 or more POLY arms such as PEG. The variable n represents the number of POLY arms, where each of the polymer arins can independently be end-capped or :altematively, possess a reactive functional group at its terminus.   Typically, at least one polymer arm possesses a terminal functional group. In such multi-armed embodiments of the invention, each PEG arm typically possesses an electrophile at its terminus (or the corresponding reaction product between the electrophile and the nucleophile as previously described). Branched PEGs such as those represented generally by the formula, R(PEG)n, above possess 2 polymer arms to about 300 polymer arms (i.e., n ranges from 2 to about 300). Preferably, such branched PEGs possess from 2 to about 25 polymer arms, more preferably from 2 to about 20 polymer arms, and even more preferably from 2 to about 15 polymer arms or fewer. Most preferred are multi-armed polymers having 3,4, 5, 6, 7 or 8 arms.<br>
Preferred core molecules in branched PEGs as described above are polyols. Such polyols include ahphatic polyols having from 1 to 10 carbon atoms and from 1 to 10 hydroxyl groups, including ethylene glycol, alkane diols, alkyl glycols, alkylidene alkyl diols, alkyl cycloalkane diols, 1,5-decalindiol, 4,8-bis(hydroxymethyl)tricyclodecane, cycloalkylidene diols, dihydroxyalkanes, trihydroxyalkanes, and the like. Cycloaliphatic polyols may also be employed, including straight chained or closed-ring sugars and sugar alcohols, such as mannitol,<br><br>
sorbitol, inositol, xylitol, quebrachitol, threitol, arabitol, erythritol, adonitol, ducitol, facose, ribose, arabinose, xylose, lyxose, rhamnose, galactose, glucose, fructose, sorbose, mannose, pyranose, altrose, talose, tagitose, pyranosides, sucrose, lactose, maltose, and the Uke. Additional aliphatic polyols include derivatives of glyceraldehyde, glucose, ribose, mannose, galactose, and related stereoisomers. Other core polyols that may be used include crown ether, cyclodextrins, dextrins and other carbohydrates such as starches and amylose. Preferred polyols include glycerol, pentaerythritol, sorbitol, and trimethylolpropane.<br>

Additional multi-arm polymers for use in preparing a thiol-selective polymer of the invention include multi-arm PEGs available from Nektar (Huntsville, Alabama). Preferred multi-armed electrophilically activated polymers for use in the method of the invention correspond to the following structure, where E represents an electrophilic group.<br>
(Structure Removed)<br>
PEG is -(CH2CH2O)nCH2CH2-, and m is selected from the group consisting of 3,4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. Of course, the corresponding thiol-selective polymer product possesses the structure shown above with the exception that the electrophile, E, is replaced by "-X-Y-S" (XI-B).<br>
Alternatively, the polymer segment may possess an overall forked structure. An example of a forked PEG corresponds to the following generalized structure, where the first structure<br><br>
represents an electrophilically activated forked PEG and the second structure represents a forked thiol-selective polymer product:<br>
(Structure Removed)<br>
where PEG is any of the forms of PEG described herein, A is a linking group, preferably a hydrolytically stable linkage such as oxygen, sulfur, or -C(0)-NH-, F and F' are hydrolytically stable spacer groups that are optionally present, and the other variables corresponding to E, X, Y, and S are as defined above. Both the general and specific descriptions of possible values for X, Y and S are applicable to the structure above. Examplary linkers and spacer groups corresponding to A, F and F' are described in International Application No. PCT/US99/05333, and are useful in forming polymer segments of this type for use in the present invention. F and F' are spacer groups that may be the same of different. In one particular embodiment of the above, PEG is mPEG, A corresponds to -C(0)-NH-, and F and F' are both methylene or -CH2-. This type of polymer segment is useful for reaction with two active agents, where the two active agents are positioned a precise or predetermined distance apart, depending upon the selection of F and F.<br>
In any of the representative structures provided herein, one or more degradable linkages may be contained in the polymer segment to allow generation in vivo of a PEG-disulfide linked conjugate having a smaller PEG chain than in the initially administered conjugate. Appropriate physiologically cleavable linkages include but are not limited to ester, carbonate ester, carbamate, sulfate, phosphate, acyloxyalkyl ether, acetal, and ketal. Such linkages when contained in a given polymer segment will preferably be stable upon storage and upon initial administration. More particularly, as described generally above, two or more polymer segments connected by a hydrolyzable linkage may be represented by the following structure: PEGl-W-PEG2 (where PEGl and PEG2 can be the same or different) and W represents a weak.<br><br>
hydrolyzable linkage. These polymer structures contain PEG arms or portions of PEG arms that are removable (i.e., cleavable) in-vivo.<br>
Additional representative PEGs having either linear or branched structures for use in preparing the conjugates of the invention may be purchased from Nektar Therapeutics (formerly Shearwater Corporation, Huntsville, Alabama). Illustrative structures are described in Shearwater's 2001 catalogue entitled "Polyethylene Glycol and Derivatives for Biomedical Applications", the contents of which is expressly incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Generally, the nominal average molecular mass of the water-soluble polymer segment, POLY will vary. The nominal average molecular mass of POLY typically falls in one or more of the following ranges: about 100 daltons to about 100,000 daltons; from about 500 daltons to about 80,000 daltons; from about 1,000 daltons to about 50,000 daltons; from about 2,000 daltons to about 25,000 daltons; from about 5,000 daltons to about 20,000 daltons. Exemplary nominal average molecular masses for the water-soluble polymer segment POLY include about 1,000 daltons, about 5,000 daltons, about 10,000 daltons, about 15,000 daltons, about 20,000 daltons, about 25,000 daltons, about 30,000 daltons, and about 40,000 daltons. Low molecular weight POLYs possess molecular masses of about 250, 500, 750,1000,2000, or 5000 daltons. Exemplary thiol selective derivatives comprise PEGs having a molecular weight selected from the group consisting of 5,000 daltons, 20,000 daltons and 40,000 daltons as provided in Examples 1-3.<br>
In one particular embodiment of the invention, an activated thiol selective derivative as provided herein possesses a PEG segment having one of the following nominal average molecular masses: 500, 1000,2000,3000, 5000,10,000,15,000,20,000, 30,000 and 40,000 daltons.<br>
In terms of the number of subunits, PEGs for use in the invention will typically comprise a number of (-OCH2CH2-) subunits falling within one or more of the following ranges: 10 to about 4000 subunits, from about 20 to about 1000 subunits, from about 25 to about 750 subunits, from about 30 to about 500 subunits.<br>
Although any of a number of polymers (POLY) may be utilized, in one embodiment, the polymer comprises a hydrophilic polymer, that is to say, a polymer containing fewer than about 25 subunits of polypropylene oxide or other similar hydrophobic polymer segments. The polymer may, in an alternative embodiment, be absent polypropylene oxide or similar hydrophobic subunits.   In one instance, the polymer is preferably not a pluronic-type polymer.<br><br>
In yet another particular embodiment, the polymer is preferably not bound to a solid support. In yet another specific instance, a polymer of the invention is one that may be although is not necessarily substantially absent fatty acid groups or other lipophilic moieties.<br>
Polymer ElectroDhilic Groups ("E")<br>
A polymer for use in the method contains as least one electrophile or electrophilic group<br>
(-E) suitable for reaction with a nucleophile, such as that contained in the thiol-selective reactant<br>
molecule. Exemplary electrophiles include activated esters (e.g. N-hydroxysuccinimidyl (NHS)<br>
ester or l-hydroxybenzotriazolyl ester), active carbonates (e.g	xysuccinimidyl<br>
carbonate, para-nitrophenylcarbonate, and 1-hydroxybenzotrionate), acetal, aldehyde,<br>
aldehyde hydrate, active anhydrides such as acid anhydrides,; aryl halide, ketone,<br>
carboxylic acid, isocyanate, isothiocyanate, imidoester, and tharticularly preferred are<br>
activated esters such as NHS esters. In sum, a polymer segment having the generalized structure, POLY-L0,1-E, can possess any electrophilic group at at least one terminus, where exemplary electrophiles include those described above.<br>
Polvmer Linkers, L<br>
In most cases, the polymer segment is directly attached to the electrophile. Alternatively, the polymer segment is attached to the electrophile via an intervening linker, L. When such a linker is utilized, it is represented generally herein as L1, meaning that such a linker is present. When such a linker is absent, it is represented herein generally as L0-   Linkers for use in the instant invention are typically C1-C10 alkyl or C1-C10 substituted alkyl.   One particularly preferred linker, e.g., in the instance where the polymer segment is PEG, e.g., -(CH2CH2-O)„-CH2CH2-, is a methylene group, -CH2-, although any linear lower alkyl, or branched lower alkyl, or their substituted counterparts may similarly be employed.<br>
Purified Electrophilicallv Activated Polvmers<br>
Particular suitable for use in the present method are electrophilically activated PEG reagents such as chromatographically purified carboxylic acids or their functional equivalents, such as mPEG-succinimidyl propionate, mPEG-succinimidyl butanoate, mPEG-CM-HBA-NHS, niPEG2-NHS, and the like available from Nektar, Huntsville, Alabama. By virtue of their acid functionality, such electrophilically activated PEGs are more readily purified prior rather than<br><br>
subsequent to reaction with a bifunctional reactant molecule, NU-Y-S, to allow separation of PEG-diol or diol-derived impurities. Purification of POLY-E can be accomplished by any of a number of purification methods commonly employed in the art, although chemical-based separation and chromatographic methods are preferred. One such preferred chromatography method is ion-exchange chromatography or lEC. lEC is useful for the separaition of any charged molecule, such as a PEG-acid. Typical ion exchange chromatography conditions can be readily determined by one of skill in the art, such as the particular column, pH range employed, ionic strength, choice of buffer, gradient, and the like.<br>
In some instances, gel permeation chromatography or GPC is utilized to determine the purity of PEG-containing reactants and derivatives. So, in one instance, GPC may be used to determine the extent of PEG-diol or diol-derived impurities in a given PEG-starting material or PEG reactant. Once having confirmed the presence and quantity of PEG-diol, e.g., by GPC, the PEG-starting material or derivative, such as a PEG-acid, is then purified by ion exchange chromatography to remove any PEG-diol or PEG-diol related impurities, such that the resulting PEG composition is substantially absent such bifunctional PEG impurities.<br>
Such electiophilically activated PEG reagents are preferably substantially pure, i.e., absent PEG-diol or reactive difunctional PEG-diol derived impurities.   Preferably, the starting material, POLY-Lo,1-E, will contain less than about 10% of any such impurity, preferably less than about 5% of any such impurity, and more preferably less than about 2% or no detectable amount of any such impurity. Correspondingly, this means that the resulting thiol-specific -functionalized polymer, POLY-S, preferably comprises at least 90% or at least 95% or at least 98% or more of the desired polymer-based product absent significant amounts of difunctionalized polyethylene glycol impurities derived from PEG-diol. Certain difunctionalized polymer impurities of this type, particularly the corresponding dithiols or protected dithiols resulting from carrying through such impurities when practicing the method of the invention, can be very difficult to remove. Such reactive impurities, if carried through the reaction scheme to the final activated polymer derivative, can then react with target coupling moieties such as thiol-containing groups in proteins or other active agents, to provide polymer conjugates in addition to those intended.<br><br>
THOL-SELECTrvE REACTANT MOLECULE<br>
In accordance with the method of the invention, POLY-Lo,1-E is reacted with a reactant molecule that contains both a nucleophile (-NU) for reaction with the electrophilic group of the activated polymer and a thiol-selective group as described above. Generally, a molecular reactant for use in the invention will possess the structure NU-Y-S where NU is a nucleophile, Y is a group interposed between NU and S, and S is a thiol-selective group.<br>
Y is typically but is not necessarily linear in nature. The overall length of the Y group will typically range between 1 to about 20 atoms, or from about 2 to 15 atoms, where by length is meant the number of atoms in a single chain, not counting substituents. For instance, -CH2-counts as one atom with respect to overall linker length, -CH2CH2O- counts as 3 atoms in length. Preferably, Y has a length of about 1 to about 20 atoms, or from about 2 to about 15 atoms, or from about 1 to about 6 atoms, and is hydrolytically stable. Representative Y groups may be any of the following: -CH2-, -CH2-CH2-, -CH2-CH2-CH2-,<br>
-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-, -O-CH2-, -CH2-O-, -O-CH2-CH2-, CH2-0-CH2-, -CH2-CH2-O-,<br>

-CH2-CH2-CH2-C(O)-NH-CH2-CH2-, -CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-C(O)-NH-, -C(O)-O-CH2-, -CH2-C(O)-O-CH2-, -CH2-CH2-C(O)-O-CH2-, -C(O)-O-CH2-CH2-, -NH-C(O)-CH2-, -CH2-NH-C(O)-CH2-, -CH2-CH2-NH-C(O)-CH2-, -NH-C(O)-CH2-CH2-, -CH2-NH-C(O)-CH2-CH2, -CH2-CH2-NH-C(O)-CH2-CH2, -C(O)-NH-CH2-, -C(O)-NH-CH2-CH2-, -O-C(O)-NH-CH2-, -O-C(O)-NH-CH2-CH2-, -NH-CH2-, -NH-CH2-CH2-, -CH2-NH-CH2-, -CH2-CH2-NH-CH2-, -C(O)-CH2-, -CO)-CH2-CH2-, -CH2-C(O)-CH2-, -CH2-CH2-C(O)-CH2-, -CH2-CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH2-, -CH2-CH2-C(O)-, -CH2-CH2-CH2-C(O)-NH-CH2-CH2-NH-,-CH2-CH2-CH2-C(O)-NH-CH2-CH2-NH-C(O)-, -CH2-CH2-CH2-C(O)-NH-CH2-CH2-NH-C(O)-CH2-, a cycloalkylene group, or a substituted<br><br>
cycloalkylene group, -CH2-CH2-CH2-C(O)NH-CH2-CH2-NH-C(O)-CH2-CH2-, and combinations of two or more of any of the foregoing.<br>
Preferred Y groups for use in the invention include, for example, alkylene, substituted alkylene, cycloalkylene, substituted cycloalkylene, aryl, and substituted aryl. Y typically comprises from about 2 to about 10 carbon atoms, and optionally may contain additional non-interfering atoms. Illustrative Y groups possess the structure:<br>
(Structure Removed)<br>
where R1and R2 in each occurrence are each independently H or an organic radical that is selected from the group consisting of alkyl, substituted alkyl, cycloalkyl, substituted cycloalkyl, alkylenecycloalkyl, cycloalkylene, substituted cycloalkylene, and substituted alkylenecycloalkyl. Preferably, Y is composed of from two to about ten carbon atoms. Exemplary Y groups include methylene (-CH2.), ethylene (-CH2CH2.), propylene (-CH2CH2CH2.), butylene (-CH2CH2CH2CH2-), pentylene (-CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2-), 2-methylpropyl, substituted counteiparts, and the like. In a particular embodiment of the above structure, R1and R2 are both H.<br>
Another preferred Y group possesses the structure: -(CH2)1,2,3,4,5-NH-C(O)-CH2CH2-.<br>
Thiol-Selective Group. "S"<br>
Exemplary thiol-selective groups include thiol, protected thiol, disulfide, maleimide, vinylsulfone, iodoacetamide, and orthopyridyl disulfide. "S" as set forth herein represents any thiol-selective group. Particularly, "S" may represent a thiol, thiolate, disulfide or other protected thiol group. Protecting groups for the thiol moiety, besides disulfide, include trityl, thioethers such as alkyl and benzyl thioethers, including monothio, dithio and aminothio acetals, thioesters, thiocarbonates, thiocarbamates, and sulfenyl derivatives. Structures corresponding to these exemplary "S" groups are provided below, where a dotted line indicates a point of attachment to the Y portion of the molecule. A-SH indicates an active agent having a thiol group.<br><br>

The Nucleophile<br>
The nucleophile portion of the reactant molecule is any nucleophile commonly known in the art. Preferred nucleophiles include primary amino, secondary amino, hydroxy, imino, thiol, thioester and the like. Secondary amino groups will typically possess as a substituent a lower alkyl group such as methyl, ethyl.<br>
Thus, molecular reactant molecules for use in the invention posses;  any combination of NU, Y, and S groups provided herein. Preferred molecular reactants include cystamine, an illustrative symmetrical amino disulfide compound, and cysteamine, an amino thiol, as well as is<br><br>
N-(2-amino-ethyl)-3-maleimido-propionamide.   Reactions carried out with the exemplary molecular reactant, cystamine, are provided in Examples 1-3 and an exemplary reaction scheme with the molecular reactant, N-(2-amino-ethyl)-3-maleimido-propionamide, is provided below.<br>

REACTION CONDITIONS<br>
The reaction between the electrophilic group of the polymer and the nucleophile in the molecular reactant is typically although not necessarily carried out under mild reaction conditions, depending of course on the particular electrophile and nucleophile that are undergoing reaction. Typically, such reactions are conducted at temperatures at around 100°C or less, or at 65 °C or less, or at 40°C or less, or at about 25°C or less. The reacting step is typically carried out in an organic solvent such as acetone, acetonitrile, chlorinated hydrocarbons such as<br><br>
chloroform and dichloromethane, aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene or xylene, tetrahydrofuran (THF), dimethylformamide (DMF), or dimethylsulfoxide.<br>
Particular reaction conditions (solvent, molar ratios of reactants, temperature, atmosphere, reaction times) will be readily determined by one skilled in the art, depending upon the choice of particular reactants and the desired products. The course or progress of the reaction can be monitored by any of a number of common analytical techniques such as thin layer chromatography or 1HNMR<br>
In instances in which the thiol-selective moiety is a protected thiol, an additional deprotection step may be required. Conditions for deprotection will depend upon the nature of the protecting group, and such can readily be determined by one skilled in the art, e.g., as described in Greene, T., and Wuts, Peter G.M., "PROTECTIVE GROUPS IN ORGANIC SYNTHESIS, Chapter 6, 3rd Edition, John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York, 1999 (p. 454-493).<br>
When a symmetrical disulfide reagent such as cystamine is employed as the molecular reactant, the resulting polymer product is a symmetrical polymer having a central disulfide bond. Representative symmetrical water-soluble polymers having a central disulfide bond are provided as structures (10) and (12), although many alternative structures having these basic features may readily be envisioned, based upon the descriptions of the reaction and POLY, L1, E, NU, Y, and S groups provided herein. The symetrical polymer disulfide can then be converted to the corresponding thiol-terminated polymer, e.g., (11) and (13), and the like, by reduction with a suitable reducing agent such as dithiothreitol, Sn/HCl, Na/xylene, ammonia, lithium aluminum hydride, sodium borohydride or any other reducing agent known in the art.<br>
THIOL-SELECnVE POLYMERS<br>
In another aspect, the invention also provides thiol-selective polymers having the features and components described above. Generally, a thiol-selective polymer of the possesses the following structure: POLY-L0,1-X-Y-S, where the variables L, X, Y and S have been previously described. All of the above exemplary POLYs, linkers, Y groups, and S groups are encompassed by the generalized structure for a thiol-selective polymer of the invention above.   Preferably, X, a functional group resulting from the reaction of the electrophile of the polylner reagent and the nucleophile on the molecular reactant, is either an amide (-C(O)-NH-, or a urethane, -O-C(O)-NH-. In some instances, the functional group X is designated herein as "-G1-C(O)-G2-", where G1 and G2 are each independently a heteroatom such as O, NH, or S. In one embodiment, G1 is<br><br>
absent, and Y corresponds to C(O)-G. Preferably, G2 is -NH. Symmetrica] polymer disulfides of the invention possess the generalized structure: (POLY-L0,1-X-Y-S-)2,II, which encompasses all of the herein described POLYs, linkers, and Y groups.<br>
STORAGE OF POLYMER REAGENTS<br>
Preferably, the thiol-selective polymers of the invention are stored under an inert atmosphere, such as under argon or under nitrogen. It is also preferable to minimize exposure of the polymers of the invention to moisture. Thus, preferred storage conditions are under dry argon or another dry inert gas at temperatures below about -15 °C.  Storage under low temperature conditions is preferred, since rates of undesirable side reactions are slowed at lower temperatures. In instances where the polymer segment of the polymer product is PEG, the PEG portion can react slowly with oxygen to form peroxides along the PEG portion of the molecule. Formation of peroxides can ultimately lead to chain cleavage, thus increasing the polydispersity of the PEG reagents provided herein. In view of the above, it is additionally preferred to store the polymers of the invention in the dark.<br>
THIOL-ACTIVATED POLYMER CONJUGATES<br>
The present invention also encompasses conjugates formed by reaction of any of the herein described thiol-selective polymers. In particular, the thiol-selective polymers of the invention are useful for conjugation to active agents or surfaces bearing at least one thiol or amino group available for reaction. Conjugates will possess the structure corresponding to functional groups formed by reacting any of the herein described thiol-selective groups, e.g., thiol, maleimide, vinylsulfone, orthopyridyldisulfide, with an accessible thiol contained in an active agent.<br>
For instance, a conjugate of the invention may possess the following structure: POLY-L0,1-X-Y-S-S-active agent, IV, where S-S- is a disulfide bond.<br>
Alternatively, a conjugate of the invention may possess the following structure:<br><br><br>
(Structure Removed)<br><br>
where "-S-active agent" represents an active agent, preferably a biologically active agent, comprising a thiol (-SH) group, and the other variables are as described previously.    In instances where the active agent is a biologically active agent or small molecule containing only one reactive thiol group, the resulting composition may advantageously contain only a single polymer conjugate species, due to the relatively low number of sulfhydryl groups typically contained within a protein and accessible for conjugation. In some instances, a protein or small molecule or other active agent is engineered to possess a thiol group in a known position, and will similarly result in a composition comprising only a single polymer conjugate species.  This approach is generally referred to as site-specific modification.<br>
Alternatively, a conjugate of the invention may possess the following structure:<br><br>
(Structure Removed)<br><br><br>
In the above structure, "-NH-active agent" represents an active agent or surface comprising an amino group, preferably a biologically active agent, and the other variables are as previously iescribed. Under certain reaction conditions, maleimide groups can react with amino groups, !uch as those present in an active agent such as a protein.<br>
A cysteine residue for coupling to an activated polymer of the invention may be naturally<br>
occurring (i.e., occurs in the protein in its native form) or may be inserted into the native<br>
sequence in place of a naturally-occurring amino acid using standard genetic engineering<br>
techniques. Since thiol groups are less numerous in proteins than are other typical polymer<br>
attachment sites such as amino groups, covalent attachment of a polymer derivative can result in<br>
more selective pegylation of the target protein. That is to say, the polymer derivatives of the<br>
invention can allow greater control over the resulting polymer conjugate - both in the number of<br>
polymer derivatives attached to the parent protein (mono versus di- versus tri-substituted<br>
conjugates, etc.) and the position of polymer attachment.	 <br>
The generalized features of the conjugates of the invention have been described in  detailed fashion above. Active agents that are covalently attached to a thiol-selective polymer<br><br>
encompass any of a number of types of molecules, entities, surfaces, and the like, as will become apparent from the following.<br>
TARGET MOUECULES AND SURFACES<br>
The thiol-selective polymers of the invention may be attached, either covalently or non-covalently, to a number of entities including films, chemical separation and purification surfaces, solid supports, metal/metal oxide surfaces such as gold, titanium, tantalum, niobium, aluminum, steel, and their oxides, silicon oxide, macromolecules, and small molecules. Additionally, the polymers and methods of the invention may also be used in biochemical sensors, bioelectronic switches, and gates. The polymers and methods of the invention may also be employed in preparing carriers for peptide synthesis, for the preparation of polymer-coated surfaces and polymer grafts, to prepare polymer-ligand conjugates for affinity partitioning, to prepare cross-linked or non-cross-linked hydrogels, and to prepare polymer-cofactor adducts for bioreactors.<br>
A biologically active agent for use in providing a conjugate of the invention may be any one or more of the following. Suitable agents may be selected from, for example, hypnotics and sedatives, psychic energizers, tranquilizers, respiratory drugs, anticonvulsants, muscle relaxants, antiparkinson agents (dopamine antagnonists), analgesics, anti-inflammatories, antianxiety drugs (anxiolytics), appetite suppressants, antimigraine agents, muscle contractants, anti-infectives (antibiotics, antivirals, antifungals, vaccines) antiarthritics, antimalarials, antiemetics, anepileptics, bronchodilators, cytokines, growth factors, anti-cancer agents, antithrombotic agents, antihypertensives, cardiovascular dmgs, antiarrhythmics, antioxicants, anti-asthma agents, hormonal agents including contraceptives, sympathomimetics, diuretics, lipid regulating agents, antiandrogenic agents, antiparasitics, anticoagulants, neoplastics, antineoplastics, hypoglycemics, nutritional agents and supplements, growth supplements, antienteritis agents, vaccines, antibodies, diagnostic agents, and contrasting agents.<br>

The conjugates or methods described herein can also be extended to hydrogel formulations.<br><br>
METHODS OF CONJUGATION<br>
Suitable conjugation conditions are those conditions of time, temperature, pH, reagent concentration, solvent, and the like sufficient to effect conjugation between a polymeric reagent and an active agent. As is known in the art, the specific conditions depend upon, among other things, the active agent, the type of conjugation desired, the presence of other materials in the reactionrnixture and so forth. Sufficient conditions for effecting conjugation in any particular case can be determined by one of ordinary skill in the art upon a reading of the disclosure herein, reference to the relevant literature, and/or through routine experimentation.<br>
Exemplary conjugation conditions include carrying out the conjugation reaction at a pH of from about 6 to about 10, and at, for example, a pH of about 6.0,6.5,7.0,7.5, 8.0, 8.5,9.0, 9.5, or 10. The reaction is allowed to proceed from about 5 minutes to about 72 hours, preferably from about 30 minutes to about 48 hours, and more preferably from about 4 hours to about 24 hours or less. Temperatures for conjugation reactions are typically, although not necessarily, in the range of from about 0 °C to about 40 °C; conjugation is often carried out at room temperature or less. Conjugation reactions are often carried out in a buffer such as a phosphate or acetate buffer or similar system.<br>
With respect to reagent concentration, an excess of the polymeric reagent is typically combined with the active agent. In some cases, however, it is preferred to have stoichiometic amounts of the number of reactive groups on the polymeric reagent to the amount of active agent. Exemplary ratios of polymeric reagent to active agent include molar ratios of -about 1:1 (polymeric reagent:active agent), 1.5:1,2:1,3:1,4:1, 5:1,6:1, 8:1, or 10:1. The conjugation reaction is allowed to proceed until substantially no further conjugation occurs, which can generally be determined by monitoring the progress of the reaction over time.<br>
Progress of the reaction can be monitored by withdrawing aliquots from the reaction mixture at various time points and analyzing the reaction mixture by SDS-PAGE or MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry or any other suitable analytical method. Once a plateau is reached with respect to the amount of conjugate formed or the amount of unconjugated polymer remaining, the reaction is assumed to be complete. Typically, the conjugation reaction takes anywhere from minutes to several hours (e.g., from 5 minutes to 24 hours or more). The resulting product mixture is preferably, but not necessarily purified, to separate out excess reagents, unconjugated reactants (e.g., active agent) undesired multi-conjugated species, and free<br><br>
or unreacted polymer. The resulting conjugates can then be further characterized using analytical methods such as MALDI, capillary electrophoresis, gel electrophoresis, and/or chromatography.<br>
More preferably, a thiol-selective polymer of the invention is typically conjugated to a sulfhydryl-containing active agent at pHs ranging from about 6-9 (e.g., at 6,6.5,7,7.5, 8, 8.5, or 9), more preferably at pHs from about 7-9, and even more preferably at pHs from about 7 to 8. Generally, a slight molar excess of polymer reagent is employed, for example, a 1.5 to 15-fold molar excess, preferably a 2-fold to 10 fold molar excess. Reaction times generally range from about 15 minutes to several hours, e.g., 8 or more hours, at room temperature. For sterically hindered sulfhydryl groups, required reaction times may be significantly longer. Since the polymers of the invention are thiol-selective, thiol-selective conjugation is preferably conducted at pHs around 7.<br>
SEPARATION<br>
Optionally, conjugates produced by reacting a thiol-selective polymer of the invention with a biologically active agent are purified to obtain/isolate different species, e.g., PEG-species, or to remove undesirable reaction side-products.<br>
If desired, PEG conjugates having different molecular weights can be isolated using gel filtration chromatography, While this approach can be used to separate PEG conjugates having different molecular weights, this approach is generally ineffective for separating positional isomers having different pegylation sites within a protein. For example, gel filtration chromatography can be used to separate from each other mixtures of PEG 1-mers, 2-mers, 3-mers, etc., although each of the recovered PEG-mer compositions may contain PEGs attached to different reactive groups within the protein.<br>
Gel filtration columns suitable for carrying out this type of separation include Superdex'™ and SephadexTM columns available from Amersham Biosciences. Selection of a particular column will depend upon the desired fractionation range desired. Elution is generally carried out using a non-amine based buffer, such as phosphate, acetate, or the like. The collected fractions may be analysed by a number of different methods, for example, (i) OD at 280 run for protein content, (ii) BSA protein analysis, (iii) iodine testing for PEG content (Sims G.-E,- C, et at, Anal. I Biochem, 107,60-63,1980), or alternatively, (iv) by running an SDS PAGE gel, followed by staining with barium iodide.<br>
'o<br><br>
Separation of positional isomers can be carried out by reverse phase chromatography using, for example, an RP-HPLC C18 column (Amersham Biosciences or Vydac) or by ion exchange chromatography using an ion exchange column, e.g., a SepharoseTM ion exchange column available from Amersham Biosciences. Either approach can be used to separate PEG-biomolecule isomers having the same molecular weight (positional isomers).<br>
Depending upon the intended use for the resulting PEG-conjugates, following conjugation, and optionally additional separation steps, the conjugate mixture may be concentrated, sterile filtered, and stored at low temperatures from about -20 °C to about -80 °C. Alternatively, the conjugate may be lyophilized, either with or without residual buffer and stored as a lyophilized powder. In some instances, it is preferable to exchange a buffer used for conjugation, such as sodium acetate, for a volatile buffer such as ammonium carbonate or ammonium acetate, that can be readily removed during lyophilization, so that the lyophilized protein conjugate powder formulation is absent residual buffer. Alternatively, a buffer exchange step may be used using a formulation buffer, so that the lyophilized conjugate is in a form suitable for reconstitution into a formulation buffer and ultimately for administration to a mammal.<br>
-PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONS<br>
The present invention also includes pharmaceutical preparations comprising a conjugate as provided herein in combination with a pharmaceutical excipient. Generally, the conjugate itself will be in a solid form (e.g., a precipitate) or in solution, which can be combined with a suitable pharmaceutical excipient that can be in either solid or liquid form.<br>
Exemplary excipients include, without limitation, those selected from the group consisting of carbohydrates, inorganic salts, antimicrobial agents, antioxidants, surfactants, buffers, acids, bases, and combinations thereof.<br>
A carbohydrate such as a sugar, a derivatized sugar such as an alditol, aldonic acid, an esterified sugar, and/or a sugar polymer may be present as an excipient. Specific carbohydrate excipients include, for example: monosaccharides, such as fructose, maltose, galactose, glucose, D-mannose, sorbose, and the like; disaccharides, such as lactose, sucrose, trehalose, cellobiose, and the like; polysaccharides, such as raffinose, melezitose, maltodextrins, dextrans, starches, and the like; and alditols, such as mannitol, xylitol, maltitol, lactitol, xylitol, sorbitol (glucitol), pyranosyl sorbitol, myoinositol, and the like.<br><br>
The excipient can also include an inorganic salt or buffer such as citric acid, sodium chloride, potassium chloride, sodium sulfate, potassium nitrate, sodium phosphate monobasic, sodium phosphate dibasic, and combinations thereof.<br>
The preparation may also include an antimicrobial agent for preventing or deterring microbial growth. Nonlimiting examples of antimicrobial agents suitable for the present invention include benzalkonium chloride, benzethonium chloride, benzyl alcohol, cetylpyridinium chloride, chlorobutanol, phenol, phenylethyl alcohol, phenylmercuric nitrate, thimersol, and combinations thereof.<br>
An antioxidant can be present in the preparation as well. Antioxidants are used to prevent oxidation, thereby preventing the deterioration of the conjugate or other components of the preparation. Suitable antioxidants for use in the present invention include, for example, ascorbyl palmitate, butylated hydroxyanisole, butylated hydroxytoluene, hypophosphorous acid, monothioglycerol, propyl gallate, sodium bisulfite, sodium formaldehyde sulfoxylate, sodium metabisulfite, and combinations thereof.<br>
A surfactant may be present as an excipient. Exemplary surfactants include: polysorbates, such as "Tween 20" and "Tween 80," and pluronics such as F68 and F88 (both of which are available from BASF, Mount Olive, New Jersey); sorbitan esters; lipids, such as phospholipids such as lecithin and other phosphatidylcholines, phosphatidylethanolamines (although preferably not in liposomal form), fatty acids and fatty esters; steroids, such as cholesterol; and chelating agents, such as EDTA, zinc and other such suitable cations.<br>
Acids or bases may be present as an excipient in the preparation. Nonlimiting examples of acids that can be used include those acids selected from the group consisting of hydrochloric acid, acetic acid, phosphoric acid, citric acid, malic acid, lactic acid, formic acid, trichloroacetic acid, nitric acid, perchloric acid, phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid, fumaric acid, and combinations thereof. Examples of suitable bases include, without limitation, bases selected from the group consisting of sodium hydroxide, sodium acetate, ammonium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, ammonium acetate, potassium acetate, sodium phosphate, potassium phosphate, sodium citrate, sodium formate, sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate, potassium fumerate, and combinations thereof.<br>
The pharmaceutical preparations encompass all types of formulations and in particular those that are suited for injection, e.g., powders that can be reconstituted as well as suspensions and solutions. The amount of the conjugate (i.e., the conjugate formed between the active agent<br><br>
and the polymer described herein) in the composition will vary depending on a number of factors, but will optimally be a therapeutically effective dose when the composition is stored in a unit dose container (e.g., a vial). In addition, the pharmaceutical preparation can be housed in a syringe. A therapeutically effective dose can be determined experimentally by repeated administration of increasing amounts of the conjugate in order to determine which amount produces a clinically desired endpoint.<br>
The amount of any individual excipient in the composition will vary depending on the activity of the excipient and particular needs of the composition. Typically, the optimal amount of any individual excipient is determined through routine experimentation, i.e., by preparing compositions containing varying amounts of the excipient (ranging from low to high), examining the stability and other parameters, and then determining the range at which optimal performance is attained with no significant adverse effects.<br>
Generally, however, the excipient will be present in the composition in an amount of about 1% to about 99% by weight, preferably from about 5%-98% by weight, more preferably from about 15-95% by weight of the excipient, with concentrations less than 30% by weight most preferred.<br>
These foregoing pharmaceutical excipients along with other excipients are described in "Remington: The Science &amp; Practice of Pharmacy", 19th ed., Williams &amp; Williams, (1995), the "Physician's Desk Reference", 52nd ed., Medical Economics, Montvale, NJ (1998), and Kibbe, A.H., Handbook of Pharmaceutical Excipients, 3rd Edition, American Pharmaceutical Association, Washington, D.C., 2000.<br>
The pharmaceutical preparations of the present invention are typically, although not necessarily, administered via injection and are therefore generally liquid solutions or suspensions immediately prior to administration. The pharmaceutical preparation can also take other forms such as syrups, creams, ointments, tablets, powders, and the like. Other modes of administration are also included, such as pulmonary, rectal, transdermal, transmucosal, oral, intrathecal, subcutaneous, intra-arterial, and so forth.<br>
As previously described, the conjugates can be administered injected parenterally by intravenous injection, or less preferably by intramuscular or by subcutaneous injection. Suitable formulation types for parenteral administration include ready-for-injection solutions, dry powders for combination with a solvent prior to use, suspensions ready for injection, dry insoluble<br><br>
compositions for combination with a vehicle prior to use, and emulsions and liquid concentrates for dilution prior to administration, among others.<br>
METHODS OF ADMINISTERING<br>
The invention also provides a method for administering a conjugate as provided herein to a patient suffering from a condition that is responsive to treatment with conjugate. The method comprises administering, generally via injection, a therapeutically effective amount of the conjugate (preferably provided as part of a pharmaceutical preparation). The method of administering may be used to treat any condition that can be remedied or prevented by administration of the particular conjugate. Those of ordinary skill in the art appreciate which conditions a specific conjugate can effectively treat. The actual dose to be administered will vary depend upon the age, weight, and general condition of the subject as well as the severity of the condition being treated, the judgment of the health care professional, and conjugate being administered. Therapeutically effective amounts are known to those skilled in the art and/or are described in the pertinent reference texts and literature. Generally, a therapeutically effective amount will range from about 0.001 mg to 100 mg, preferably in doses from 0.01 mg/day to 75 mg/day, and more preferably in doses from 0.10 mg/day to 50 mg/day.<br>
The unit dosage of any given conjugate (again, preferably provided as part of a pharmaceutical preparation) can be administered in a variety of dosing schedules depending on the judgment of the clinician, needs of the patient, and so forth. The specific dosing schedule will be known by those of ordinary skill in the art or can be determined experimentally using routine methods. Exemplary dosing schedules include, without limitation, administration five times a day, four times a day, three times a day, twice daily, once daily, three times weekly, twice weekly, once weekly, twice monthly, once monthly, and any combination thereof. Once the clinical endpoint has been achieved, dosing of the composition is halted.<br>
One advantage of administering the conjugates of the present invention is that individual water-soluble polymer portions can be cleaved off. Such a result is advantageous when clearance from the body is potentially a problem because of the polymer size. Optimally, cleavage of each water-soluble polymer portion is facilitated through the use of physiologicallycleavable and/or enzymatically degradable linkages such as urethane, amide, carbonate or ester-containing linkages. In this way, clearance of the conjugate (via cleavage of individual water-soluble polymer portions) can be modulated by selecting the polymer molecular size and the type<br><br>
functional group that would provide the desired clearance properties. One of oidinary skill in the art can determine the proper molecular size of the polymer as well as the cleavable functional group. For example, one of ordinary skill in the art, using routine experimentation, can determine a proper molecular size and cleavable functional group by first preparing a variety of   polymer derivatives with different polymer weights and cleavable functional groups, and then obtaining the clearance profile (e.g., through periodic blood or urine sampling) by administering the polymer derivative to a patient and taking periodic blood and/or urine sampling. Once a series of clearance profiles have been obtained for each tested conjugate, a suitable conjugate can be identified.<br>

EXAMPLE 1<br>
Preparation of mPEG (5K).Thiol, MPEG(5K)-CH2CH2CONHCH2CH2SH (11)<br>

Corporation, now Nektar Therapeutics, (Shearwater Catalog 2001, Polyethylene Glycol and Derivatives for Biomedical Applications), Huntsville, Alabama.<br>
The preparation of mPEG-5K succinimidyl propionate is described generally in U.S. Patent No. 5,672,662 (Shearwater Polymers), and in the "Materials and Methods" sections above.<br>
Synthesis ofM-PEG(5.000)-Thiol (11)<br>
Reaction Scheme:<br>
(Scheme Removed)<br>
M-PEG propionic acid, NHS ester, (4), (MW = 5,268,10.0 g, 1.898 mmol) was dissolved in dichloromethane (100 ml) to which were added cystamine dihydrochloride (0.2278 g, 1.012 mmol) and triethylamine (0.66 ml). The solution was stirred overnight at room temperature under an atmosphere of argon. The Gel Permeation Chromatography (GPC) analysis showed the reaction mixture contained the desired product (10) (symmetrical disulfide having a molecular weight of about 10,000) in 97.53 % yield and M-PEG(5,000)-Propionic Acid in 2.14 % yield.<br>
Dithiothreitol (DTT) (0.88 g, 0.005705 moles) and triethylanoine (0.5 ml) were then added and the reaction mixture was stirred for 3 h at room temperature under argon. Next 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol (BHT) (0.05 g) was added and the solvent was distilled off under reduced pressure. The crude thiol product (11) was dissolved in dichloromethane (20 ml) and precipitated with isopropyl alcohol at 0 - 5° C. Yield after drying was 8.80 g.<br>
GPC analysis: Desired product: M-PEG(5,000)-thiol, (11), 96.05 % yield; M-PEG(5,000)-propionic acid, 0.57 % yield; non-reduced dimer, (10), 3.07 %. NMR (d6-DMSO): 1.52 ppm (t, 1H, -SB); 2.31 ppm (t, 2H, -CH2-CO-); 2.66 ppm (dt, 2H, - CH2-S-); 3.21 ppm, (s, 3H, -OCH3), 3.51 ppm (s, PEG backbone); 8.05 ppm (t, IH, -NH-).<br><br>
Both the exemplary disulfide intermediate, (10), and the reduced PEG-thiol product, (11), were prepared in high yield and in high purity using a simple reaction scheme requiring only two steps. The exemplary reagent, cystamine, is commercially available, and the amino group therein is readily substituted for the succinimidyl group on the carbonyl product. The exemplary use of a stoichiometric amount of symmetrical reagent having two terminal reactive amino groups makes the reaction "cleaner" due to the formation of only one substitution product not contaminated by excess of reagent. The resulting PEG-thiol product is suitable for coupling to a reactive thiol group, e.g., contained in a drug or in a cysteine residue of a protein, to form a corresponding PEG conjugate. The PEG linkages (i.e., the linker portion of the molecule connecting the PEG chain or backbone to a reactive thiol group on a drug or other species) described herein are stable and provide a new class of water-soluble, non-naturally occurring polymers suitable that can be readily synthesized, and that can be used to selectively modify or pegylate proteins or other reactive molecules without the need.for multiple synthetic steps, protection-deprotection steps, and multiple purifications.<br>

(Scheme Removed)<br>
M-PEG(20K)-butanoic acid, NHS ester (9) (MW = 20,000 daltons, 10.0 g, 0.500 mmol) was dissolved in dichloromethane (100 ml) and cystamine dihydrochloride (0.0564 g, 0.251 mmoles) and triethylamine (0.167 ml) were added. The solution was stirred overnight at room temperature under an atmosphere of argon. The GPC analysis showed that the reaction mixture contained the desired product (dimer having molecular weight about 40,000, (12)) 98.5 % pure and 1.5% M-PEG(20,000)-butanoic acid.<br>
Dithiothreitol (DTT) (0.23 g, 1.500 mmoles) and triethylamine (0.5 ml) were added and the reaction mixture was stirred for 3 h at room temperature under an argon atmosphere. Next BHT (0.05 g) was added and the solvent was distilled under reduced pressure. The crude product was dissolved in dichloromethane (20 ml) and precipitated with isopropyl alcohol at 0 - 5° C.<br>
Yield after drying 9.20 g. HPLC analysis: M-PEG(20K)-Thiol (13) 96.0 % , M-PEG(20,000)-butanoic acid 1.5 %, non-reduced dimer 2.5 %.<br>
Similar to Example 1 above, this example demonstrates the preparation of yet another representative PEG-thiol (as well as its corresponding disulfide precursor). The synthesis is straightforward, requiring only two reaction steps: substitution of the representative nucleophilic amino group on cystamine at the electrophilic carbonyl carbon on the illustrative PEG reagent, (9), followed by reduction of the disulfide to yield the corresponding PEG-thiol. The use of a symmetrical disulfide reagent simplifies the synthesis, making purification of the PEG-thiol product unnecessary. The PEG-thiol is formed in high yield (greater than 90%, in fact greater than 95%), and is suitable for coupling with reactive thiol groups e.g., contained in cysteine residues of therapeutic proteins, or introduced by chemical means into a protein or polypeptide, or present in small molecules or other active agents.<br><br>
