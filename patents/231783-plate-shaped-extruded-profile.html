				<td>The present invention relates to plate shaped extruded profile.<br>
The invention relates to a plate-shaped extruded profile for the purpose of producing a plate fastening, wherein there is formed on one of the side edges of the extruded profile a longitudinal U-shaped recess which is delimited by two extensions, one of which extensions comprises on its free end a cylindrical bead and the other side edge comprises a prolongation which in its region facing the bead comprises a channel which is formed to correspond to the bead.<br>
The object of the invention is to provide a plate-shaped extruded profile which can be used to produce straight, bent and polygonal plate fastenings in a convenient manner.<br>
There are many known connections between two or several extruded profiles to form a straight plate fastening.<br>
Such an extruded profile for forming a loading tailboard of a vehicle is described in GB 1 288 454 Al. The object forming the basis of GB 1 288 454 is to provide a straight profile plate, consisting of mutually engaging hollow profiles, to define a loading space, which<br>
i*	-	r-	'<br>
profile plate is to prevent the undesired penetration of water into the loading space. For this purpose the joint sites of the hollow profiles are designed such that when they are assembled together they delimit a chamber which comprises a greater cross-section than the adjacent walls. In order to facilitate the discharge of any water which may have penetrated the chamber, there is provided below the chamber a fit which has a cross-section similar to that of a ball and socket joint for the purpose of forming a water outlet.<br>
FR 2510 061 A2 describes a side wall, consisting of hollow profile parts, which have a rectangular cross-section, for transportation holds, wherein the hollow profile parts mutually engage in a form-locking manner in the region of their joint sites, which produces a straight<br>
line of the plate fastening.<br>
The object is achieved with an extruded profile of the type mentioned in the introduction in accordance with the invention by virtue of the fact, that the prolongation on its side which faces the extension, which lies opposite the extension comprising the bead, is delimited by a cylindrical surface whose radius corresponds to the distance of the axis of the bead from the free end of the opposite extension, wherein the depth of the recess corresponds to the length of the prolongation.<br>
In this manner one or several such extruded profiles can be connected mutually and ordered in series to form a straight, bent or polygonal plate fastening, for which purpose the extruded profiles are expediently welded together. By virtue of the design in accordance with the invention of the side edges of the extruded profile the individual profiles are fixed in their mutual relative position prior to and during the connection process. In order to produce a plate fastening where the profiles are arranged at an angle with respect to each other the bead of one profile is inserted into the channel of the other profile, the profiles are then pivoted relatively to each other and thus the cylindrical surface is guided along the facing extension into the U-shaped recess until the desired relative position of the profiles is achieved, following which the connection or weld connection is performed. The extruded profile is provided for forming walls, partition walls, rooves and for use in vehicle construction.<br>
In one advantageous further embodiment of the invention the extension comprising the bead can be longer than the extension opposite it, which results in an increase of the angular region, in which the profiles can be disposed with respect to each other.<br>
It is of further advantage, if the cylindrical surface is provided with longitudinal grooves and if the extension facing the cylindrical surface comprises on its free end a longitudinal edge which engages into one of the grooves. This improves the mutual fixing of the profiles during the connection process.<br>
The grooves can be disposed at predetermined uniform intervals which enables the extruded profiles to be disposed at various predetermined angles with respect to each other.<br>
Furthermore, the channel can comprise a recess disposed approximately in the middle as a welding puddle safety device.<br>
Similarly, the extension facing the cylindrical surface can comprise in the region of its free end a recess as a welding puddle safety device.<br>
The recess can be adjacent to the longitudinal edge. The fixing process can be enhanced in this manner.<br>
The invention is further explained hereinunder with reference to preferred exemplified embodiments which are illustrated in the drawings, in which:<br>
Figure 1	shows a cross-sectional view of the connection site of two extruded profiles<br>
according to a first embodiment,<br>
Figure 2	shows a cross-sectional view of the connection site of a variant of this<br>
embodiment,<br>
Figure 3	shows a cross-sectional view of the connection site of two extruded profiles<br>
according to a second embodiment,<br>
Figure 4	shows a cross-sectional view of the connection site of two extruded profiles<br>
according to a third embodiment,<br>
Figure 5	shows a cross-sectional view of this connection site with the pivot range of the<br>
extruded profiles indicated,<br>
Figure 6	shows a cross-sectional view of the connection site of two extruded profiles<br>
according to a fourth embodiment,<br>
Figure 7	shows a cross-sectional view through a polygonal plate fastening,<br>
Figure 8	shows a cross-sectional view through two extruded profiles which are<br>
mutually connected and bent at the greatest possible angle,<br>
Figure 9	shows a cross-sectional view through two mutually connected extruded<br>
profiles for the purpose of illustrating the mutual pivot facility,<br>
Figure 10        shows a cross-sectional view through a polygonal plate fastening which forms a roof, and<br>
Figure 11         shows a cross-sectional view through a plate fastening which forms part of a vehicle construction.<br>
Figure 1 illustrates a cross-sectional view through the connection site of two identically formed extruded profiles, 1, 1, of which in each case only the side edges 2, 3 are illustrated. The side edge 2 of one extruded profile 1 (to the right in the drawing) comprises a U-shaped recess 4 which is delimited by two parallel extensions 5, 6. One extension 5 comprises on its free end a cylindrical bead 7. The other side edge 3 is provided with a prolongation 8 which in its region facing the bead 7 comprises a channel 9, which is formed to correspond with the bead 7, and on the opposite side is delimited by a cylindrical surface 10. The radius of this cylindrical surface 10 corresponds to the distance of the axis of the bead 7 from the free end of the opposite extension 6.<br>
For the purpose of connecting the two extruded profiles 1, 1, the said profiles are disposed at such an angle that the free end of the prolongation 8 is located at a distance from the free end of the extension 6, facing it, of the other extruded profile and then the bead 7 is inserted into<br>
the channel 9. By mutually pivoting the two extruded profiles 1, 1 the prolongation 8 is then inserted into the U-shaped recess 4. The two extruded profiles 1, 1 can be pivoted out of their co-planar position illustrated in Figure 1 by an angle a which amounts to approx. 30°.<br>
Figure 2 illustrates a cross-sectional view through a variant of this embodiment where the angle a is smaller. The remaining form of the side edges 2, 3 of the extruded profile 1 corresponds to the design described above, with the exception that the channel 9 comprises a middle recess 1 1 which serves as a weld puddle safety device.<br>
The embodiment in accordance with Figure 3 corresponds substantially to that of the previously described embodiment, with the exception that the extension 5 which comprises the bead 7 is longer than the extension 6 which is opposite extension 5 and faces the cylindrical surface 10. As indicated by the angles p and y, this embodiment achieves a great pivot range of the extruded profiles 1,1.<br>
Figure 4 illustrates a cross-sectional view through a further embodiment which corresponds substantially to the previously explained embodiments, however, in the region of the free end of the extension 6 facing the cylindrical surface 10 it also comprises a recess 1 1 as a weld puddle safety device.<br>
Figure 5 illustrates the pivot facilities of the extruded profiles 1, 1 of this embodiment.<br>
In accordance with Figure 6, in the case of a further embodiment the cylindrical surface 10 is provided with a section of longitudinal grooves, wherein the extension 6 facing the cylindrical surface 10 comprises at its free end a sharp, longitudinal edge 13 which engages into one of the grooves 12. When connecting the two extruded profiles 1, 1 in the manner explained above, the edge 13 slides owing to the material elasticity towards the desired groove 1 2, but it is held sufficiently securely in its desired position in order to fix the two extruded profiles 1 , 1 during welding thereof. The grooves are preferably disposed at predetermined uniform distances d, which renders it possible to arrange the extruded profiles<br>
6 1, 1 at various predetermined angles Q with respect to each other. (Figure 7 to 9)<br>
Figure 7 illustrates a cross-sectional view through a polygonal plate fastening which is produced from several extruded profiles 1 of the invention and can be used, for example, as a partition wall.<br>
Figure 8 illustrates two extruded profiles 1 which are pivoted at the greatest possible angle with respect to each other. The plate fastening formed can also be used to form a partition wall.<br>
Figure 9 illustrates two extruded profiles 1 in different relative positions.<br>
Figure 10 illustrates a polygonal plate fastening consisting of several extruded profiles 1 which is formed as a roof. The mutually connected extruded profiles 1 comprise a width L and form a plate fastening which is drawn in an imaginary cylinder having the radius R.<br>
Figure 11 illustrates part of a construction of a rail-borne vehicle which consists partially of plate fastenings which are produced using the extruded profile 1 of the invention. Two planar plate fastenings in each case are illustrated on the side, whereas the roof is formed from a polygonal plate fastening which is drawn in an imaginary cylinder having the radius R.<br><br><br><br><br>
