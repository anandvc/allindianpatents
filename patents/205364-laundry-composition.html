Laundry Composition<br>
The present invention relates to an ingredient for laundry cleaning or treatment products, for deposition onto fabric during a washing, rinsing or other treatment process.  It further extends to compositions containing such an ingredient and methods of fabrics treatment using these compositions.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The laundry process generally has several benefits for fabric, the most common being to remove dirt and stains from the fabric during the wash cycle and to soften the fabric during the rinse cycle.  However, there are numerous disadvantages associated with repeated use of conventional laundry treatment compositions and/or the actual laundry process;one of these being a fairly harsh treatment of fabric in the laundry process.<br>
The present invention is directed towards maintaining the new appearance of fabric and enhancing the feel and softness of the fabric despite the laundering process.   Examples of retained fabric appearance are that the fabric retains its original colour (that is less dye loss and dye transfer), does not fuzz or pill, prevents the fabric from bagging and maintains its surface definition and appearance.<br><br>
A further advantage of the present invention is that fabrics treated with the composition have a tendency to become less creased and/or wrinkled and do not become thin due to the loss of fibres.<br>
In laundry cleaning or treatment products, it is essential for some ingredients to be deposited onto and adhere to the fabric for them to deliver their beneficial effects. Typical examples are fabric conditioners or softeners.<br>
WO 00/18860 and WO 00/18861 describe agents which deposit cellulose or cellulose-like materials onto the fabric to at least partially replace the lost material of the fibre and which add to the softening of fabrics.<br>
EP-A-0 084 772 discloses a graft polymer dispersion comprising a vinyl-containing organopolysiloxane, an organopolysiloxane with unsubstituted silicon atom and polymerised units of vinyl monomers.  Aqueous emulsions of these materials are used as water repellents to be applied to textiles during manufacture, whilst also endowing a softening and smoothing effect.  Unlike conventional silicones they are said to offer the advantage of retaining elasticity and recovery  of the weave.  There is also a disclosure of strengthening of textiles during manufacture by application of acrylates, polyacrylates and polymetacrylates.<br><br>
WO-A-98/29528 discloses cellulose ethers in which some substituents are (poly)alkoxylated, analogues of the latter in which the (poly)alkoxylated groups are terminated with a cationic moiety in the form of a quaternary ammonium group, and cellulose ethers in which some substituents are carboxylic acids in the salt form (i.e. the materials are essentially carboxymethylcellulose variants<br>
WO-A-99/14245 discloses laundry detergent compositions containing cellulosic based polymers to provide appearance and integrity benefits to fabrics.  These polymers are cellulosic polymers in which the saccharide rings have pendant oxygen atoms to which substituents 'R' are bonded, i.e. they are attached to the rings via an ether linkage. The groups 'R' can be hydrogen, lower alkyl or alkylene linkages terminated by carboxylic acid, ester or amide groups.  Optionally, up to five alkyl eneoxy groups may be interspersed between the groups are the respective oxygen atom.<br>
US-A-4372328 discloses material for tobacco smoke filters comprising cellulose fibres containing amino groups which is prepared by reacting cellulose with dichloroaminotriazines, trichlorotriazines, trichlorodiazines, tetrachlorodiazines, 2,3-dichloroquinoxalines, divinyl sulfone, epichlorohydrin or cyanogen bromide and the cellulose derivatives thus obtained are subsequently reacted with amino compounds such, as ammonia, guanidine and amino acids, such as, arginine,<br><br>
histidine, tryptophane, a,y-diaminobutyric acid, ornithine, citrulline and canavanine.<br>

The synthesis of the cellulose esters that are used as the starting materials for the polymers of the present invention are described in WO 00/18860.<br>
The general synthesis of the polymers involves:<br><br>
i)dissolving the cellulose ester in an appropriate non<br>
aqueous solvent<br>
ii)adding a base and cyanuric halide,<br>

It is preferred if the level of total non-ionic surfactant is from 0 wt% to 3 0 wt%, preferably from l wt% to 25 wt%, most preferably from 2 wt% to 15 wt%.<br>
Another class of suitable surfactants comprises certain mono-alkyl cationic surfactants useful in main-wash laundry compositions.  Cationic surfactants that may be used include quaternary ammonium salts of the general formula R1R2R3R4 X" wherein the R groups are long or short hydrocarbon chains, typically alkyl, hydroxyalkyl or ethoxylated alkyl groups, and X is a counter-ion (for example, compounds in which R2 is a C8-C22 alkyl group, preferably a C8-Cl0 or C12-C14 alkyl group,<br><br>
R2 is a methyl group, and R3 and R4, which may be the same or different, are methyl or hydroxyethyl groups) ; and cat ionic esters (for example, choline esters).<br>
The choice of surface-active compound (surfactant), and the amount present, will depend on the intended use of the detergent composition. In fabric washing compositions, different surfactant systems may be chosen, as is well known to the skillad formulator, for handwashing products and for products intended for use in different types of washing machine.<br>
The total amount of surfactant present will also depend on the intended end use and may be as high as 60 wt%, for example, in a composition for washing fabrics by hand. In compositions for machine washing of fabrics, an amount of from 5 to 40 wt% is generally appropriate.  Typically the, compositions will comprise at least 2 wt% surfactant e.g. 2-60%, preferably 15-40% most preferably 25-35%.<br>
Detergent compositions suitable for use in most automatic fabric washing machines generally contain anionic non-soap surfactant, or non-ionic surfactant, or combinations of the two in any suitable ratio, optionally together with soap.<br>
Any conventional fabric conditioning agent may be	used in<br>
the compositions of the present invention.   The<br>
conditioning agents may be cationic or non-ionic.	If the<br>
fabric conditioning compound is to be employed in	a main<br><br>
wash detergent composition the compound will typically be non-ionic.  If used in the rinse phase, they will typically be cationic.  They may for example be used in amounts from 0.5% to 35%, preferably from 1% to 3 0% more preferably from 3% to 25% by weight of the composition.<br>
Preferred cationic fabric softening agents comprise a substantially water insoluble quaternary ammonium material comprising a single alkyl or alkenyl long chain having an average chain length greater than or equal to C20 or, more preferably, a compound comprising a polar head group and two alkyl or alkenyl chains having an average chain length greater than or equal to C14.<br>
Preferably, the cationic fabric softening agent is a quaternary ammonium material or a quaternary ammonium material containing at least one ester group. The quaternary ammonium compounds containing at least one ester group are referred to herein as ester-linked quaternary ammonium compounds.<br>
As used in the context of the quartemary ammonium cationic fabric softening agents, the term "ester group', includes an ester group which is a linking group in the molecule.<br>
It is preferred for the ester-linked quaternary ammonium compounds  to contain  two or more ester groups.     In both monoester and the diester quaternary ammonium compounds it<br><br>
is preferred if the ester group(s) is a linking group between the nitrogen atom and an alkyl group.  The ester groups(s) are preferably attached to the nitrogen atom via another hydrocarbyl group.<br>
The compositions of the invention, when used as main wash fabric washing compositions, will generally also contain one or more detergency builders.  The total amount of detergency builder in the compositions will typically range from 5 to 80 wt%, preferably from 10 to 60 wt%.<br>
Inorganic builders that may be present include sodium carbonate, if desired in combination with a crystallisation seed for calcium carbonate, as disclosed in GB 1 437 950 (Unilever) , crystalline and amorphous aluminosilicates, for example, zeolites as disclosed in GB 1 473 201 (Henkel), amorphous aluminosilicates as disclosed in GB 1 473 2 02 (Henkel) and mixed crystalline/amorphous aluminosilicates as disclosed in GB 1 470 250 (Procter &amp; Gamble) ; and layered silicates as disclosed in EP 164 514B (Hoechst). Inorganic phosphate builders, for example, sodium orthophosphate, pyrophosphate and tripolyphosphate are also suitable for use with this invention.<br>
The compositions of the invention preferably contain an alkali metal, preferably sodium, aluminosilicate builder. Sodium aluminosilicates may generally be incorporated in<br><br>
amounts of from 10 to 70% by weight (anhydrous basis), preferably from 25 to 50 wt%.<br>
The alkali metal aluminosilicate may be either crystalline or amorphous or mixtures thereof, having the general formula:  0.8-1.5 Na20. A1203. 0.8-6 Si02<br>
These materials contain some bound water and are required to have a calcium ion exchange capacity of at least 50 mg CaO/g. The preferred sodium aluminosilicates contain 1.5-3.5 SiO2 units (in the formula above). Both the amorphous and the crystalline materials can be prepared readily by reaction between sodium silicate and sodium aluminate, as amply described.in the literature.  Suitable crystalline sodium aluminosilicate ion-exchange detergency builders are described, for example, in GB 1 429 143 (Procter &amp; Gamble). The preferred sodium aluminosilicates of this type are the well-known commercially available zeolites A and X, and mixtures thereof.<br>
The zeolite may be the commercially available zeolite 4A now widely used in laundry detergent powders. However, according to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the zeolite builder incorporated in the compositions of the invention is maximum aluminium zeolite P (zeolite MAP) as described and claimed in EP 384 070A (Unilever). Zeolite MAP is defined as an alkali metal aluminosilicate of the zeolite P type having a silicon to aluminium ratio not exceeding 1.33, preferably<br><br>

Especially preferred organic builders are citrates, suitably used in amounts of from 5 to 3 0 wt%, preferably from 10 to 25 wt%; and acrylic polymers, more especially acrylic/maleic copolymers, suitably used in amounts of from 0.5 to 15 wt%, preferably from 1 to 10 wt%.<br>
Builders, both inorganic and organic, are preferably present in alkali metal salt, especially sodium salt, form.<br><br>
Compositions according to the invention may also suitably contain a bleach system. Fabric washing compositions may desirably contain peroxy bleach compounds, for example, inorganic persalts or organic peroxyacids, capable of yielding hydrogen peroxide in aqueous solution,<br>
■ Suitable peroxy bleach compounds include organic peroxides such as urea peroxide, and inorganic persalts such as the alkali metal perborates, percarbonates, perphosphates, persilicates and persulphates. Preferred inorganic persalts are sodium perborate monohydrate and tetrahydrate, and sodium percarbonate.<br>
Especially preferred is sodium percarbonate having a protective coating against destabilisation by moisture. Sodium percarbonate having a protective coating comprising sodium metaborate and sodium silicate is disclosed in GB 2 123 044B (Kao).<br>
The peroxy bleach compound is suitably present in an amount of from 0.1 to 35 wt%, preferably from 0.5 to 25 wt%.  The peroxy bleach compound may be used in conjunction with a bleach activator (bleach precursor) to improve bleaching action at. low wash temperatures. The bleach precursor is suitably present in an amount of from 0.1 to 8 wt%, preferably from 0.5 to 5 wt%.<br>
Preferred bleach precursors are peroxycarboxylic acid precursors, more especially peracetic acid precursors and<br><br>
pernoanoic acid precursors. Especially preferred bleach precursors suitable for use in the present invention are N,N,N',N',-tetracetyl ethylenediamine (TAED) and sodium nonoyloxybenzene sulphonate (SNOBS). The novel quaternary ammonium and phosphonium bleach precursors disclosed in US 4 751 015 and US 4 818 426 (Lever Brothers Company) and EP 402 9 71A (Unilever), and the cationic bleach precursors disclosed in EP 284 292A and EP 303 520A (Kao) are also of interest.<br>
The bleach system can be either supplemented with or replaced by a peroxyacid. examples of such peracids can be found in US 4 686 063 and US 5 397 501 (Unilever) .  A preferred example, is the imido peroxycarboxylic class of peracids described in EP A 325 288, EP A 349 940, DE 382 3172 and EP 325 289. A particularly preferred example is phtalimido peroxy caproic acid (PAP). Such peracids are suitably present at 0.1 - 12%, preferably 0.5 - 10%.<br>
A bleach stabiliser (transistor metal sequestrant) may also be present. Suitable bleach stabilisers include ethylenediamine tetra-acetate (EDTA), the polyphosphonates such as Dequest (Trade Mark) and non-phosphate stabilisers such as EDDS (ethylene diamine di-succinic acid).

An especially preferred bleach system comprises a peroxy bleach compound (preferably sodium percarbonate optionally<br><br>
together with a bleach activator), and a transition metal bleach catalyst as described and claimed in EP 458 397A ,EP 458 398A and EP 509 787A (Unilever).<br>
The compositions according to the invention may also contain one or more enzyme(s).<br>
Suitable enzymes include the proteases, amylases, cellulases, oxidases, peroxidases and lipases usable for incorporation in detergent compositions.  Preferred proteolytic enzymes (proteases) are, catalytically active protein materials which degrade or alter protein types of stains when present as in fabric stains in a hydrolysis reaction.  They may be of any suitable origin, such as vegetable, animal, bacterial or yeast origin.<br>
Proteolytic enzymes or proteases of various qualities and origins and having activity in various pH ranges of from 4-12 are available and can be used in the instant invention. Examples of suitable proteolytic enzymes are the subtilisins which are obtained from particular strains of B.. subtilis B. licheniformis, such as the commercially available subtilisins Maxatase (Trade Mark), as supplied by Gist Brocades N.V., Delft, Holland, and Alcalase (Trade Mark), as supplied by Novo Industri A/S, Copenhagen, Denmark.<br>
Particularly suitable is a protease obtained from a strain of Bacillus having maximum activity throughout the pH range of 8-12, being commercially available, e.g. from Novo Industri A/S under the registered trade-names Esperase (Trade Mark)<br><br>

Other commercial proteases are Kazusase (Trade Mark obtainable from Showa-Denko of Japan), Optimase (Trade Mark from Miles Kali-Chemie, Hannover, West Germany), and Superase (Trade Mark obtainable from Pfizer of U.S.A.).<br>
Detergency enzymes are commonly employed in granular form in amounts of from about 0.1 to about 3.0 wt%.  However, any suitable physical form of enzyme may be used.<br>
The compositions of the invention may contain alkali metal, preferably sodium carbonate, in order to increase detergency and ease processing. Sodium carbonate may suitably be present in amounts ranging from 1 to 60 wt%, preferably from 2 to 40 wt%. However, compositions containing little or no sodium carbonate are also within the scope of the invention.<br>
Powder flow may be improved by the incorporation of a small amount of a powder structurant, for example, a fatty acid (or fatty acid soap) , a sugar, an acrylate or acrylate/maleate copolymer, or sodium silicate.  One preferred powder structurant is fatty acid soap, suitably present in an amount of from 1 to 5 wt%.<br>

The present invention will now be explained in more detail by way of the following non-limiting examples. Compositions of the invention are illustrated by a number comparative compositions are illustrated by a letter.<br>
Example 1 (synthesis):<br>
Cellulose acetate with a degree of acetate substitution of 0.6 and molecular weight of 16000 (DS=0.6, mw=16k) was prepared according to method described in WO 00/18860. Cellulose acetate (D3=0.6, mw=16k) (10 g) was dissolved in dimethyl acetamide (100 mL).  Cyanuric chloride (9 g dissolved in 50 mL of dimethyl acetamide) and Na2C03 (4 g) were added to the cellulose monoacetate solution and stirred at ambient temperature for 72 h.  Following this the yellow solution was centrifuged, the supernatant separated and the solvent removed under reduced pressure to give a yellow oil. The oil was dissolved in water, resulting in a precipitate which was removed by centrifuging.. Polymer A was isolated from the aqueous solution by precipitation into acetone, filtering and drying under vacuum to give a yellow coloured solid.  Yield 1.5 g.<br>
CHN analysis: C 33.7; H 5.6; N 3.7<br>
Degree of acetate  substitution  is  0.6.<br>

a carbonate buffer is:  2.42 g of NaHC03 + 7.55 g Na2C03 in 1<br>
L of demineralised water<br>
The total amount of cloth added to each solution was 25.9 g, giving a liquor to cloth ratio of 15:1. The solutions and cloths were added to linitest pots and washed for 30 min at 40 °C at 40 rpm to simulate a standard wash. The cloths were rinsed in the linitester with 400 mL of deionised for lO mins.<br>
The cloths were then tumble-dried in a Miele Novotronic T430 on a hot setting for 40 min, ironed flat and then conditioned for at least 24 hr at 20 °C and 65 % relative humidity.<br><br>
The effect of Polymer A on softness was evaluated using a Kawabata Shear Tester.  The results are.shown in the following table:<br><br>
The lower the H.G. value the softer the fabric as taught in WO92/13053.<br>
A reduction in the value of HG for composition 1 shows that Polymer A gives an increased level of softness to the fabric.<br>
Examples 4, 5 and 6<br>
To the following solutions a 10 cm x 10 cm white cotton cloth (desized, mercerised, bleached, non-fluorescent) and a 10 cm x 10 cm black cotton (direct black 22 - 1% dyed from stock) were added. The cloths were also overlooked to stop any fraying into solution of fibres.<br>
Woven cotton swatches were treated in the following solutions:<br><br>
Composition   C:<br>
5.0  mL of   0.1  M carbonate  buffer   (pH  -   10.5)a<br>
5.0  mL of   10  g/L  surfactant   soluti onb<br>
40.0 mL deraineralised water<br>
Compositon   D:<br>
5.0  mL of   0.1  M carbonate  buffer   (pH -   10.5)a<br>
5.0   mL of   10  g/L  surfactant   solutionb<br>
0.02  g of  cellulose  acetate   (DS=0.6,   mw=16k)    (to give  0.4<br>
g/L)<br>
40.0 mL demineralised water<br>
Composition 2:<br>
5.0 mL of 0.1 M carbonate buffer (pH ~ 10.5)a<br>
5.0 mL of 10 g/L surfactant solutionb<br>
0.02 g of Polymer A (to give 0.4 g/L)<br>
4 0.0 mL demineralised water<br>
a carbonate buffer is:  2.42 g of NaHC03 + 7.55 g Na2C03 in 1 L of demineralised water<br>
b surfactant solution is:  10.0 g of Linear Alkyl Sulfate (50 % active) + 5.0 g Synperonic A7 in 1 L of demineralised<br>
water<br>
The total amount of cloth added to each solution approximately 3.0 g, giving a liquor to cloth ratio of 16:1. The solutions and cloths were added to linitest pots and washed for 30 min at 40 °C at 4 0 rpm to simulate a standard<br><br>
and then tumble-dried for 30mins. The cloths were then measured on the ICS Texicon Spectraflash. Settings were UV excluded from 420nm,Specular included, Large aperture, 4 cloth thickness. Readings were also taken from a non-treated piece of the same fabrics (Direct Black 22 and white) to compare against. The spectral data was used to calculate<br>
CIELAB AE values.<br>
For crease recovery angle measurement the samples were ironed flat and conditioned for at least 24 hr at 20 °C and 65 % relative humidity.  Samples of cloth 25 mm x 50 mm were folded in half and compressed with a 1 kg load for 1 min. They were then place Crease Recovery Angle Tester Determiner and the angle read after 1 min. The crease recovery angle was determined from the average of six measurements in the warp direction<br>
The results are shown in the following tables: Example 4 (Percent Colour Strength):<br><br>
Composition 2 has the highest percentage of the initial colour.<br><br>
The colour strength of greater than one hundred percent in composition 2 is due to slight shrinkage of the fabric upon contact with water which causes in increase in the amount of dye per unit fabric area as opposed to any intrinsic colour of the polymer. This effect happens with compositions C and D also but the effect is more than negated by the loss in dye from the fabric.<br>
Example 5 (White Monitor AE):<br><br>
Composition 2 has the lowest AE in each wash, which indicates the lowest pick up of dye onto the white monitor cloths.<br>
Example 7 (Crease Recovery Angle):<br><br>
Composition 2 has a higher crease recovery angle.<br><br>
