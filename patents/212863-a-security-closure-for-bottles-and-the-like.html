The present invention relates to a security closure for bottles and the like.<br>
These known closures are widely used since any unauthorized opening is obvious because it is impossible to reassemble the security band.<br>
Although the above-mentioned closures are advantageous from the functional point of view, they have the serious disadvantage that, to produce the security band in a colour different from that of the cap-like stopper is somewhat complicated and expensive and the security band is therefore difficult to distinguish, especially when the closure is monochromatic, that is to say, when the cap and the sleeve are of the same colour.<br>
A recognized requirement in the field of the production of the above-mentioned closures is that the security band should have a colour contrasting with that of the other components of the closure, particularly the cap, since any tampering with the closure is thus rendered even more obvious.<br>
During the production of known closures, the security band is formed integrally with the cap¬like stopper so that it can easily be removed upon the first unscrewing thereof.<br>
Although it is possible to apply to the security band a colour different from that of the cap, this disadvantageously complicates the already laborious colouring procedure and leads to a considerable increase in production costs since it is necessary to perform two distinct colouring steps on a single closure.<br>
Another recognized requirement is that of rendering the production of the above-mentioned closures simpler and less expensive.<br>
The technical problem upon which the present invention is based is that of providing a security closure of the type specified which has structural and functional characteristics such as to satisfy the abovementioned requirements and to overcome the abovementioned disadvantage.<br>
This problem is solved by a security closure as described herein.<br><br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a security closure for bottles and the like, comprising a pourer body, a sleeve having an inner rim for restraining the pourer body, a cap¬like stopper coupled with the pourer body by a threaded connection, and a security band, characterized in that the security band is fitted on the cap-like stopper and comprises a first ring and a second ring in firm engagement with the cap-like stopper and with the cylindrical sleeve, respectively, the first ring and the second ring being fixed together in a manner such that they are separated upon the first unscrewing of the cap-like stopper from the pourer body.<br>
Further characteristics and advantages of the closure according to the present invention will become clear from the description of some preferred embodiments given below by way of non-limiting example, with reference to the appended drawings in which:<br>
Figure 1 is a partially-sectioned view of a closure according to the invention,<br>
Figure 2 is a partial section through the closure of Figure 1 with parts separated, during<br>
assembly,<br>
Figure 3 is a perspective view of a detail of the closure of Figure 1, from below,<br>
Figure 4 is a perspective of the detail of Figure 3, from above,<br>
Figure 5 is a partially-sectioned view of the closure of Figure 1, with parts separated, during a<br>
stage of its operation,<br>
Figure 6 is a partially-sectioned view of another embodiment of the closure according to the<br>
invention, and<br>
Figure 7 is a partially-sectioned view of a further embodiment of the closure according to the<br>
invention.<br>
With reference to the appended drawings, a security closure for a bottle 2, particularly for good quality liquors, is generally indicated 1.<br>
The closure 1 comprises a pourer body 3, a cylindrical sleeve 4, a cap-like stopper 5, and a security band 6, associated coaxially with one another along an axis X-X.<br>
The pourer body 3 comprises, in its interior, a closure valve, generally indicated 7, for preventing refilling of the bottle, and is provided externally with a flange 8 and an external thread 9.<br><br>
The sleeve comprises a cylindrical body 4, which has a circular cross-section in the embodiment shown and extends axially along the axis X-X between a first head end 10 facing the cap-like stopper 5 and a second end. The cylindrical body 4 is defined by a wall 20 of predetermined thickness.<br>
At the first head end 10, the cylindrical body 4 has an annular slot 19 facing, that is to say opening, towards the cap-like stopper 5. This annular slot is defined by an end portion 20a of the wall 20 of the cylindrical body and by a second wall 21 which extends from the cylindrical body towards the first head end 10.<br>
In the embodiment shown, the annular slot 19 is formed inside the cylindrical body and the second wall 21 consequently extends from the inner surface of the wall 20 of the cylindrical body, starting a predetermined distance from the first head end 10.<br>
The second wall 21 comprises an upper end 21a in the region of which there is an inner rim 11, overlapping the flange 8, as well as an external recess 12.<br>
The cylindrical sleeve 4 is provided internally with an annular lip 13 and with axial projections 14 for engaging a groove and channels provided in the bottle 2, respectively, in order to fix the sleeve 4 to the bottle axially and rotationally.<br>
The sleeve 4 in turn holds the pourer body 3 on the bottle 2 axially owing to the engagement of the rim 11 with the flange 8. A toothed face coupling 15 is formed between the flange 8 and the rim 11 in order to fix the pourer body 3 rotationally to the cylindrical sleeve 4 and hence to the bottle 2.<br>
The second wall 21 has a plurality of axial teeth 22 formed externally thereon, and the head portion 20a of the wall 20 has a plurality of annular channels 23,<br>
The cap-like stopper 5 has an annular skirt 24 with external knurling 16 and is provided with an internal thread 17 which constitutes, with the external thread 9, a threaded coupling 18 for the unscrewing of the cap-like stopper from the pourer body and its screwing thereon, according to need.<br><br>
The skirt 24 extends beyond a top wall 26 of the cap 5 to define an outer annular rim 27 which defines an external seat 28 for housing a disc-shaped body 30. Wording, coats of arms, trade marks and/or any graphical composition required, for example, by the user of the closure according to the invention may be printed on or applied to the upper surface of the body 30.<br>
In order to fix the body 30 to the stopper 5, the annular rim 27 comprises an internal circumferential projection 27a which can deform resiliently upon the insertion of the disc¬shaped body 30 in the seat 28,<br>
The disc-shaped body 30 is thus substantially snap-fitted, since the diameter of the body 30 is slightly greater than that of the circumferential projection 27a.<br>
Naturally, other means may be provided for connecting the disc-shaped body 30 to the stopper 5, for example, these elements may be glued together.<br>
It should be noted that the cap-like stopper 5 is fixed to the cylindrical sleeve 4 by means of a line of weakening 32, which is produced by the action of blades, after the stopper and the sleeve have been moulded as a single piece.<br>
In this embodiment, the head end 21a of the wall 21 is connected to the cap-like stopper 5 by means of the line of weakening 32.<br>
The security band 6 comprises a first ring 35 and a second ring 36 which are formed as a single piece and are connected to one another by bridges 37 and the band is fitted on the cap¬like stopper 5.<br>
The ring 35 has, internally, a series of axial teeth 38 suitably shaped in a manner such that, during the assembly of the closure 1, they are fitted between the respective knurlings 16, forming a splined coupling 40.<br>
The ring 35 is thus fixed rotationally to the skirt 24 and hence to the stopper 5.<br><br>
The ring 36, on the other hand is intended to be fitted in the annular slot 19 and has, internally, a plurality of complementary axial teeth 41 which, during the assembly of the closure 1, engage the teeth 22 provided in the slot 19, forming a splined coupling 43.<br>
The ring 36 is thus fixed rotationally to the cylindrical sleeve 4.<br>
The ring 36 has a projection 36a having a profile substantially complementary to the recess 12 so as to be substantially in contact with the latter when the band 6 as a whole is fitted on the stopper 5 and the closure 1 has thus been assembled.<br>
The ring 36 also has, externally, a plurality of annular projections 45 which, during the assembly of the closure 1, snap-engage the respective channels 23 with a mutual overlap to form a coupling 46.<br>
The ring 36 is thus fixed axially to the cylindrical sleeve 4.<br>
It should be noted that, in this embodiment, the ring 35 is divided into two, structurally independent, identical, semicircular portions 35a and 35b by means of two diametrally opposed cuts.<br>
The line of weakening 32 and the two cuts are produced by the action of blades, after the security band 6 has been produced as a single piece.<br>
In this embodiment, the security band 6 further comprises the above-mentioned disc-shaped body 30 which is disposed inside the ring 35 and is initially connected thereto by means of bridges 47.<br>
A weakening 48 is provided on each of the bridges 47 to facilitate the detachment of the disc¬shaped body 30 from the ring 35 during the assembly of the closure 1.<br>
With regard to the fitting of the closure 1 according to the invention, with reference now to Figure 2, the security band 6 is fitted on the skirt 24 so that the axial teeth 38 are engaged between the knurlings 16, forming the splined coupling 40.<br><br>
The security band 6 is then slid vertically downwards, thus enabling the disc-shaped body 30 to be fitted firmly in its seat 28 after tearing of the bridges 47.<br>
The security band 6 continues to slide, without the disc-shaped body 30, until it stops when the projection 36a abuts the recess 12, thus producing a form coupling.<br>
When this abutment condition is reached, the coupling between the teeth 22 and the complementary teeth 41 and the coupling 46 between the annular projections 45 and the channels 23 are also achieved.<br>
The closure 1 according to the invention is now assembled in all of its parts as a unit which can be handled individually and as such is intended to be fitted on a bottle.<br>
Upon the first unscrewing of the cap-like stopper 5, the line of weakening 32 and the bridges 37 which hold the rings 35 and 36 together are simultaneously torn.<br>
The ring 36 is thus restrained in the slot 19 of the cylindrical sleeve 4 against any further rotation and the ring 35 is separated from the skirt 24 and is broken into the portions 35a and 35b into which it is divided. These portions fall off due to their own weight, leaving their initial positions for ever and, if replaced therein, can no longer remain there, owing to the effect of gravity.<br>
Figures 6 and 7 show two variants of the closure according to the invention in which structural elements in common with the embodiment shown in the preceding drawings have been attributed the same reference numerals.<br>
In the security closure shown in Figure 6 and generally indicated 60, the security band 61 is composed of a first ring 63 and a second ring 64 which are formed as a single piece and are connected to one another by bridges 65.<br>
As in the embodiment described above, the ring 63 has, internally, a set of axial teeth 38 in engagement with the knurling 16 of the cap-like stopper 5, forming a splined coupling 40.<br>
The ring 64 is provided with complementary axial teeth 41 in engagement with the teeth 22<br><br>
provided in the annular slot 19, forming the splined coupling 43, and with annular projections 45 in engagement with the channels 23 provided in the annular slot 19, forming the coupling 46, respectively.<br>
The ring 64 also has a projection 64a having a profile complementary to that of the recess 12.<br>
However, the ring 63 has a single axial break which gives rise to two facing and opposed edges 62.<br>
One edge 62 is rounded in the region of the comer facing the cap-like stopper 5 so as to create a lead-in opening for the gripping of the ring by the user.<br>
Alternatively, the ring 63 may have a projecting portion (not shown) in the region of an edge 62 with the function of a tongue for facilitating the above-mentioned gripping.<br>
The ring 63 is also provided externally with relief portions 66 having an anti-slip function during the gripping and tearing-open of the ring 63.<br>
In fact, in order to open the security closure 60, the user must first remove the ring 63 by gripping it in the region of the opening.<br>
He will then be able to unscrew the cap-like stopper 5, bringing about tearing of the line of weakening 32 between the stopper and the cylindrical sleeve 4.<br>
In the security closure shown in Figure 7 and generally indicated 70, the sleeve 72 is constituted by a cylindrical body comprising a first portion 73 connected to a second, inner portion 74, that is, a portion having a smaller diameter than the first portion 73, the second portion 74 having axial teeth 22.<br>
The portion 74 comprises an upper end 74a in the region of which the inner rim 11 is formed, overlapping the flange 8.<br>
The security band 76 is composed of a first ring 77 and a second ring 78 which are formed as a single piece and are connected to one another by bridges 79.<br><br>
The ring 77 has, internally, a set of axial teeth 38 in engagement with the knurlings 16 of the caplike stopper 5, forming a splined coupling 40.<br>
The ring 78, on the other hand, has complementary axial teeth 41 in engagement with the teeth 22 to form the splined coupling 43.<br>
The ring 78 also has a projection 78a having a profile complementary to that of the recess 12.<br>
The security band 76 is fitted on the cap-like stopper 5 as mentioned above so that the ring 78 is held firmly rotationally on the cylindrical sleeve 72 by the splined coupling 43 between the teeth 22 of the portion 74 and the complementary axial teeth of the ring 78.<br>
The closure 70 has an annular collar 71, preferably made of aluminium, which is applied to the cylindrical sleeve 4 and to the neck of the bottle 82 by rolling.<br>
The collar 71 has an upper end 71a in engagement on the ring 78 and a lower end 71b in engagement with a corresponding end of the neck of the bottle 82 in order to fix the ring 78 and the sleeve 4 together and to the bottle axially, the rotational fixing of these elements to the bottle at the same time being ensured by the rolling of the collar 71.<br>
The main advantage of the closure according to the present invention is that any unauthorized opening is particularly obvious, since it is impossible to reassemble the security band.<br>
It should, however, be noted that, during the production of the closure according to the invention, the security band is produced by moulding as a single component and is fixed to the other components of the closure only after assembly.<br>
This makes it easier and less expensive to colour the security band with a colour different from and possibly contrasting with that of the sleeve and of the stopper, thus rendering unauthorized opening of the closure according to the invention even more obvious than with known security closures.<br>
A further advantage of the closure according to the invention lies in its structural simplicity which is no small advantage for an article which is be manufactured on a large scale.<br><br>
Naturally, in order to satisfy contingent and specific requirements, a person skilled in the art may apply to the closure according to the invention many modifications and variations all of which, however, are included in the scope of protection of the invention as defined by the appended claims.<br><br><br><br>
