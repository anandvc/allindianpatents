The nanoparticles are chosen from a class of hard materials, preferably alumina, silica, ceria, titania, diamond, cubic boron nitride, and molybdenum oxide. The microparticles are chosen from a class of materials of layered structures, preferably graphite, hexagonal boron nitride, magnesium silicates (talc) and molybdenum disulphide.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0020]    Described herein is a novel concept into oil additives, where a combination of nanoparticles and microparticles are added into oil to smoothen and polish metallic surfaces and embed nanoparticles in the near surface regions, thereby reducing friction and wear. The additives may be in the form of nanoparticles ( l00nm), nanorods, nanotubes, nanobelts, and buckyballs. The nanoparticles in the size range (5-l00nm) reduce wear and friction by polishing, grinding and embedding into the metallic substrates. Microparticles (100nm-20,000nm), on the other hand, reduce friction by layering at the wear interfaces. The nanoparticles and microparticles can also improve physical properties such as electrical and thermal conductivity and breakdown characteristics of the oil. The nanoparticles are chosen from a class of hard materials, preferably alumina, silica, ceria, titania, diamond, cubic boron nitride, and molybdenum oxide. The microparticles are chosen from a class of materials of layered structures, preferably graphite, hexagonal boron nitride, magnesium silicates (talc) and molybdenum disulphide. The nano-micro combination can be chosen from the same materials. This group of materials includes zinc oxide, copper oxide, molybdenum oxide, graphite, talc, and hexagonal boron nitride. The relative fraction of nanoparticles to microparticles may vary from 10 to 80%, depending upon the characteristics of the wear surfaces. For newer engines, a higher fraction of nanoparticles is preferred while for older engines (e.g., 50,000 miles and higher), a higher fraction of microparticles is preferred. For engine applications, these additives are expected to eliminate environmental toxic effects associated with current oil additive formulations based upon zinc dialkyl dithiophosphate (ZDDP).<br>
[0021]    Also described herein is the formation of nanoparticles of various compositions by a novel laser synthesis method. By using this method, nanoparticles of desired chemical<br>
composition and narrow-size distribution are formed and dispersed directly into a desired medium such as an oil lubricant, thus solving a critical agglomeration problem associated with nanoparticles . Microparticles are added into the engine oil, in which nanoparticles are already dispersed, in a certain concentration and a size range to improve fuel efficiency and life duration. The size of microparticles is below the pore size of the oil filter to avoid clogging of the filters. This treatment results in surface smoothening and polishing, and embedding of particles to reduce friction and wear of the metallic engine surfaces. These additives lead to improvement in fuel efficiency as much as 35% in gasoline engines and further improvements in fuel efficiency are expected with optimization. These additives are also expected to reduce wear and improve life of other engines. These materials can be also dispersed in a base such as mineral oil, synthetic oil such as polyolefin, and polymers in a concentration of 1-10% with an overall final concentration of about 0.02 to 0.2% in the engine oil. To improve dispersion further certain surfactants may be added. Preliminary results have shown a considerable reduction of coefficient friction from a typical value of 0.22 to 0.01. Road tests combining city and highway driving showed an improvement form 22 mpg to 30 mpg after addition of an oil additive containing nanosilica, nanoalumina and micrographite in a Toyota passenger car which amounts to over 35±3% improvement in the fuel efficiency. Similar results on high fuel efficiency have been obtained in Volkswagen cars and Ford (F-150) trucks. Reduction in exhaust emissions of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide of at least 10%, at least 20%, at least 30%, at least 40%, at least 50% and up to 90%) can be achieved after the nano and microparticle treatments of this invention. [0022]    The nanoparticles include alumina, silica, ceria, titania, diamond, cubic boron nitride, and molybdenum oxide, which can be embedded into cast iron, aluminum and its alloys to increase hardness and thereby reduce friction and wear. The nanoparticles can be dispersed into the engine oil during pulsed laser ablation synthesis. Nanoparticles can also be<br>
synthesized by other physical and chemical vapor deposition methods and dispersed into the engine oil with a concentration, in weight % (wt. %) of 1.0 to 10.0%. Microparticles in the size range below the pore size of the oil filter are dispersed into the engine oil with a concentration of 1.0 to 10.0% wt. The microparticles are chosen from a class of materials of layered structures, preferably graphite, hexagonal boron nitride, magnesium silicates (talc) and molybdenum disulphide. As an example, about 50 mL of nanoparticle formulation and 50 mL of microparticle formulation can be added in one treatment of 5 quarts of engine oil, typically low viscosity 0W20, 5W20, 5W30 engine oil.<br>
[0023]    There are three distinct regimes depending upon relative sizes of oil film thickness and nanoparticles which affect friction wear and lubrication. If the oil film thickness to is greater than the particle size dn, the nanoparticles will not be as effective in changing the friction characteristics. This is known as the hydrodynamic regime. If t0 = dn, the friction will be reduced by riding on the nanoparticles and reducing the contact area. If the contact area stays fixed, then this situation can lead to load independent friction. This is known as the mixed regime. When t0 
surfaces of an engine. Under hydrodynamic lubrication conditions, nanoparticles will not be as effective because boundary layer is much thicker than their size. For microparticles, under boundary lubrication conditions, there will be polishing and smoothening out of the surface, which will reduce friction and wear. Under mixed lubrication conditions, there will still be polishing and smoothening out of the interior surfaces. Under hydrodynamic lubrication conditions, microparticles may be effective depending upon the relative thickness of the boundary layer and the size of the microparticles.<br>
[0025]    With respect to engine oil treatment, under boundary lubrication, there is fine polishing and some embedding of nanoparticles which can lead to work hardening, and under mixed and hydrodynamic lubrication, there is very limited polishing and work hardening. Regarding microparticles, under boundary lubrication, there is very limited work hardening, and friction reduction is obtained by riding the layered platelets of microparticles in mixed as well as hydrodynamic conditions.<br>
[0026]    Under high-viscosity or low-temperature operating conditions, if the boundary layer is thicker than the particle size, the treatment will not be effective. Thus, nanoparticles dispersed in low-viscosity (preferably 0W20, 5W20, 5W30) oils are found to be more effective, and effectiveness will increase with increasing temperature. As temperature increases, microparticles will take part first in smoothening the surface by filling the voids (pits and grooves) such as undulations and by providing smooth layered structures. As the boundary layer thickness decreases and boundary lubrication sets in, nanoparticles can reduce friction and wear by embedding and work hardening the wear surface regions. [0027]    The nanomaterials used in the oil additive are preferably synthesized by a pulsed laser processing method, which results in dispersed nanoparticles in any suitable medium such as mineral oil, engine oil, synthetic oil such as polyalphaolefin (PAO), and other hydrocarbons.<br>
 [0028]    Figure 1 shows a schematic of the laser processing chamber, where a high-power pulsed laser is used to ablate either a metallic or a compound target in a controlled ambient. Various types of lasers can be used for this purpose such as: (1) Pulsed EXCIMER laser wavelength from 193 nm to 500nm with pulse duration in the nanosecond regime and energy density of 2-10 cm"2; and (2) Pulsed CO2 laser where duration is varied from hundreds of nanoseconds (ns) to microseconds (µs). Thus, change in pulse duration from ns to µs increases the throughput of the nanoparticles/nanopowders considerably. For microsecond pulsed lasers, mean power is about 600-800W and peak power is about l0kW. The chemical composition of nanoparticles can be varied by controlling the laser plume and injecting appropriate reactant gases through the nozzle. This method also allows the coating of nanoparticles and the modification of surface properties to enhance dispersion in mineral oil, synthetic oil such as polyalphaolefm (PAO), and hydrocarbons. The method described herein provides a considerable improvement with respect to throughput and dispersion of nanoparticles directly into an oil medium due to the force of the nanoparticles created via laser ablation of target material.<br>
[0029]    Pulsed laser can produce nanoparticles having a narrow size distribution. A continuous CO2 laser produces ~40-60nm particles, whereas a pulsed CO2 laser (pulse duration l00µs, 400-500 Hz) can produce average an particle size of 15nm, as shown in Figure 11 for ceria nanoparticles.<br>
[0030]    Figure 2(a), (b) and (c) show ZnO nanoparticles produced by pulsed laser ablation using zinc target in oxygen ambient at atmospheric pressure. The nanparticle average size is 30nm and the ZnO nanoparticles are dispersed in the automobile engine oil 5W30 (Volvoline). Fig 3 (a) and (b) show CuO nanoparticles produced by ablation of copper target in the oxygen ambient. Fig. 4 shows nano and microparticles of h-BN dispersed in the engine oil 5W30 (Volvoline). Fig. 5 shows nano and microparticles of graphite dispersed in the<br>
engine oil 5W30 (Volvoline). Fig. 6 shows nanoparticles of alumina (average size 30-40nm) dispersed in the engine oil 5W30 (Volvoline). Fig. 7 shows nanoparticles of silica (average size 15nm) dispersed in the engine oil 5W30 (Volvoline). Fig. 8 shows nano and microparticles of molybdenum disulphide dispersed in the engine oil 5W30 (Volvoline). Fig. 9 shows nanoparticles of titania (TiO2) dispersed in the engine oil 5W30 (Volvoline). Fig. 10 shows nano and microparticles of talc dispersed in the engine oil 5W30 (Volvoline). The dispersion of ceria (CeC^) nanoparticles is clearly shown in Fig. 11 with average size of 15nm.<br>
[0031]    To examine the role of nanoparticles and microparticles on the interior surfaces of the engines, the rubbing action between piston (steel) and cylinder walls (aluminum alloy and cast iron) was simulated. The nanoparticle and microparticle treated engine oil was placed between steel/cast iron and steel/aluminum surfaces, and relative piston/cylinder wall motion simulated. The smoothening and polishing effects by nano and microparticles, embedding of nanoparticles for surface hardening, layering of microparticles, and reduction of friction and wear were investigated as function of time.<br>
[0032]    Fig. 12 (a) shows surface smoothening and polishing effect as a result of treatment with graphite oil treatment of an aluminum alloy. Fig 12 (b) shows a significant coverage with the graphite layer at a low magnification. This can fill in surface roughness on metallic surfaces. As the treatment time increases, further polishing of the surface occurs and embedding of nanoparticles of graphite is clearly shown in Fig 12(c). There are also some graphite microparticles present on the surface. Thus, graphite oil treatment results in polishing (smoothening) of interior metallic surfaces of engines to reduce friction, and embedding of nanoparticles workhardens the surface to reduce friction as well as wear. These micrographs also show embedding of graphite nanoparticles which workharden the surface to reduce wear as well as friction.<br>
 [0033]    Fig 13 (a) shows results from a combination of nano alumina and micrographite, where the polishing effect and removal of scratches are clearly demonstrated. The combined alumina and graphite treatment is quite effective in reducing friction and creating workhardening to reduce friction and wear considerably. Fig 13(b) shows complete coverage with the graphite layer at a low magnification, this action being effective to fill in the grooves and smoothen out the rough surfaces of the engine quite effectively. Fig. 13(c) demonstrates further polishing and shows that nanoparticles of alumina and graphite are embedded into the near surface regions, which can lead to hardening of the surface. There are also a few graphite microparticles present on the surface. Some of the graphite microparticles seem to have been ground to nano size range during the rubbing of metallic parts. [0034]    The SEM (scanning electron microscopy) results from this sample are shown in Fig. 14. The SEM micrographs in Figs 14(a) and 14(b) clearly show the embedding of alumina and graphite nanoparticles into a very smooth metallic surface of the aluminum alloy. A small fraction of micro graphite has a size distribution in the nano-range. Thus, alumina and graphite nano and microparticle treatment seems to be more effective in reducing friction and wear of interior parts of the engine.<br>
[0035]    The results from the treatment of cast iron engine alloy by alumina nano and graphite microparticles are shown in Figure 15. Figure 15(a) shows polishing of a rough cast iron surface and filling in of pits on the surface with graphite. Upon increasing the time of treatment, polishing and repair of surface roughness continues (Fig 15(b)). After 10 minutes of treatment, there is a polished surface and there is embedding of graphite and alumina nanoparticles into the cast iron in the near surface regions to improve friction and reduce wear via near surface workhardening (Fig. 15(c)).<br>
[0036]    Figure 16 shows an electron micrograph of embedded nickel nanoparticles into MgO ceramic. This treatment has been shown to improve mechanical properties (hardness<br>
and wear) of the near-surface regions. The embedding of nanoparticles can create plastic damage and hinder the dislocation motion. Both of these mechanisms workharden the surface and reduce friction and wear. In summary, nanoparticles and microparticles lead to reduction in friction and wear via polishing of rough surfaces, filling in pits and grooves, embedding of nanoparticles, smoothening of surfaces and interface layering. [0037]    Specific formulations were prepared based upon h-BN and graphite microparticles (size range 0.5 -15µm), and silica, alumina and zinc oxide nanoparticles (20-40nm). Nanoparticles of alumina and silica, and microparticles of graphite and h-BN were each dispersed into mineral oil or the engine oil having low viscosity (preferably 0W20, 5W20, 5W30) with concentration ranging 1.0 to 10.0 wt. % with an overall concentration (per five US quarts of oil) of 0.03%, 0.05%, 0.07%, 0.09%, 0.11%, 0.13% and 0.15% for h-BN or graphite microparticles with silica, alumina or zinc oxide nanoparticles.. [0038]   The following formulations are for 5 quarts of engine oil: (1) Formulation NP 1040: 50 mL of engine oil with 1.5%, 2.5%, 3.5%, 4.5%, 5.5%, 6.5%, and 7.5% wt. % nano silica and 50 mL of engine oil with 1.5%, 2.5%, 3.5%, 4.5%, 5.5%, 6.5%, and 7.5% wt. % micro graphite. (2) Formulation NP 2030: 50mL of nano alumina engine oil with 1.5%, 2.5%, 3.5%, 4.5%, 5.5%, 6.5%, and 7.5% wt. % and 50mL engine oil with 1.5%, 2.5%, 3.5%, 4.5%, 5.5%, 6.5%, and 7.5% wt. % of h-BN. (3) Formulation NP 2020: 100 mL engine oil with 1.5%, 2.5%, 3.5%, 4.5%, 5.5%, 6.5%, and 7.5% wt. % nano alumina. (4) Formulation NP 1030: 50 mL engine oil with 1.5%, 2.5%, 3.5%, 4.5%, 5.5%, 6.5%, and 7.5% wt. % nano silica and 50 mL engine oil with 1.5%, 2.5%, 3.5%, 4.5%, 5.5%, 6.5%, and 7.5% wt. % of micro h-BN. (5) Formulation NP 2040: 50 mL engine oil with 1.5%, 2.5%, 3.5%, 4.5%, 5.5%, 6.5%, and 7.5% wt. % of nano alumina and 50 mL engine oil with 1.5%, 2.5%, 3.5%, 4.5%, 5.5%, 6.5%, and 7.5% wt. % of micro graphite. (6) Formulation NP 1010: 100 mL engine oil with 1.5%, 2.5%, 3.5%, 4.5%, 5.5%, 6.5%, and 7.5% wt. % nano silica. (7)<br>
Formulation NP 3030: 100 mL engine oil with 1.5%, 2.5%, 3.5%, 4.5%, 5.5%, 6.5%, and 7.5% wt. % nano h-BN and micro h-BN.<br>
[0039]    The following formulations are for 5 quarts of engine oil with ZnO nanoparticles: (8) N27 formulation: 50 mL engine oil with 1.5%, 2.5%, 3.5%, 4.5%, 5.5%, 6.5%, and 7.5% wt. % micro graphite solution and 50 mL engine oil with 1.5%, 2.5%, 3.5%, 4.5%, 5.5%, 6.5%, and 7.5% wt. % nano ZnO; (9) N27 plus formulation: 50mL engine oil with 1.5%, 2.5%, 3.5%, 4.5%, 5.5%, 6.5%, and 7.5% wt. % micro h-BN and 50mL engine oil with 1.5%, 2.5%, 3.5%, 4.5%, 5.5%, 6.5%, and 7.5% wt. % nano ZnO; (10) N02 formulation: 100 mL engine oil with 1.5%, 2.5%, 3.5%, 4.5%, 5.5%, 6.5%, and 7.5% wt. % nano of ZnO. These formulations are for engine oil that is free from ZDDP as ZnO may react with ZDDP and reduce its effectiveness.<br>
[0040]    The total nanoparticle and microparticle concentrations, in weight %, of specific formulations with equal amounts of nanoparticles and microparticles (in 100ML of engine oil) can be 0.01 to 1%, 1 to 2%, 2 to 3%, 3 to 4%, 4 to 5%, 6 to 7% or higher. However, for newer engines the nanoparticle content exceeds the microparticle content and for older engines the microparticle content exceeds the nanoparticle content.<br>
[0041]    An engine oil additive can include a combination of nanoparticles ( 100 nm) of one or more materials added together or separately to the engine oil. These nanoparticles can be in the form of nanorods, nanotubes, nanobelts, and buckyballs. The nanoparticles can be chosen from the group of relatively hard materials such as nanodiamond and related materials, boron, cubic boron nitride and related materials, alumina, silica, ceria, titania, molybdenum oxide, zinc oxide, magnesium oxide and zinc-magnesium oxide alloys. The microparticles can be chosen from layered materials such as graphite, hexagonal boron nitride, molybdenum disulphide, alumina, mica, talc etc. The relative fraction of nanoparticles to microparticles may vary from 10 to 80%, depending upon<br>
the characteristics of the engine materials. The nanoparticles can be produced by a laser synthesis method. By using this method, nanoparticles of desired chemical composition and narrow-size distribution can be formed and dispersed directly into a desired medium, thus solving a critical dispersion problem associated with nanoparticles. Microparticles can be added into the engine oil, in which nanoparticles are already dispersed, in a certain concentration and size range. These particles can also be dispersed in a base such as mineral oil, engine oil, synthetic oil such as polyolefin, and monomer polymers in a concentration, in weight %, of 1-10% with an overall final concentration of about 0.02 to 0.2% in the engine oil. To improve dispersion further certain surfactants may be added. [0042]    Formulations can include the following:<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
[0043]    The specific nanoparticle plus microparticle concentrations in these formulations preferably are 1.5%, 2.5%, 3.5%, 4.5%, 5.5%, 6.5% and 7.5% with an overall concentration (per 5 US quartz of engine oil) of 0.03%, 0.05%, 0.07%, 0.09%, 0.11%, 0.13% and 0.15%. [0044]    As discussed above, the nanoparticles produce a fine polishing effect and embed into the near surface regions to reduce friction and wear. The microparticles produce a rough polishing effect and layer on the surface to reduce friction and wear. [0045]    Reduction in exhaust emissions of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide up to 90% by volume can be achieved using the nano and microparticle treatments as described<br>
herein. The nano and microparticle treatments as described herein can reduce coefficient friction of aluminum alloys and cast iron from typical values of 0.22 to 0.01. [0046]    It will be understood that the foregoing description is of the preferred embodiments, and is, therefore, merely representative of the article and methods of manufacturing the same. It can be appreciated that variations and modifications of the different embodiments in light of the above teachings will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art.
