				<td>INDOLYLALKYLAMINE DERIVATIVES<br>
This invention relates to indolylalkylamine<br>
derivatives as 5-hydroxytryptamine-6 ligands, processes<br>
for preparing them, pharmaceutical compositions<br>
containing them and to methods of treatment using them.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Various central nervous system disorders such as<br>
anxiety, depression, motor disorders, etc., are believed<br>
to involve a disturbance of the neurotransmitter 5-<br>
hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) or serotonin. Serotonin is<br>
localized in the central and peripheral nervous systems<br>
and is known to affect many types of conditions including<br>
psychiatric disorders, motor activity, feeding behavior,<br>
sexual activity, and neuroendocrine regulation among<br>
others. The effects of serotonin are regulated by the<br>
various 5-HT receptor subtypes. Known 5-HT receptors<br>
include the 5-HT1 family (e.g. 5-HT1A), the 5-HT2 family<br>
(e.g. 5-HT2A), 5-HT3, 5-HT4, 5-HT5, 5-HT6 and 5-HT7<br>
subtypes.<br>
The recently identified human 5-hydroxytryptamine-6<br>
(5-HT6) receptor subtype has been cloned, and the<br>
extensive distribution of its mRNA has been reported.<br>
Highest levels of 5-HT6 receptor mRNA have been observed<br>
in the olfactory tubercle, the striatum, nucleus<br>
accumbens, dentate gyrus and CA1, CA2 and CA3 regions of<br>
the hippocampus. Lower levels of 5-HT6 receptor mRNA<br>
are seen in the granular layer of the cerebellum, several<br>
diencephalic nuclei, amygdala and in the cortex.<br>
Northern blots have revealed that 5-HT6 receptor mRNA<br>
appears to be exclusively present in the brain, with<br>
little evidence for its presence in peripheral tissues.<br>
The high affinity of a number of antipsychotic agents for<br>
the 5-HT6 receptor, in addition to its mKNA localization<br>
in striatum, olfactory tubercle and nucleus accumbens<br>
suggests that some of the clinical actions of these<br>
compounds may be mediated through this receptor.<br>
Therefore, 5-HT6 receptor ligands are believed to be of<br>
potential use in the treatment of certain CNS disorders<br>
such as anxiety, depression, epilepsy, obsessive<br>
compulsive disorder, attention deficit disorder,<br>
migraine, cognitive memory enhancement (e.g. for the<br>
treatment of Alzheimer's disease), sleep disorders,<br>
feeding disorders (e.g. anorexia or bulimia),<br>
neurodegenerative disorders (e.g. stroke or head trauma),<br>
panic attacks, withdrawal from drug abuse (e.g. cocaine,<br>
ethanol, nicotine or benzodiazepines), schizophrenia, or<br>
the like; or in the treatment of certain gastrointestinal<br>
disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome.<br>
Therefore, it is an object of this invention to<br>
provide compounds which are useful as therapeutic agents<br>
in the treatment of a variety of central nervous system<br>
disorders related to or affected by the 5-HT6 receptor.<br>
It is another object of this invention to provide<br>
therapeutic methods and pharmaceutical compositions<br>
useful for the treatment of central nervous system<br>
disorders related to or affected by the 5-HT6 receptor.<br>
It is a feature of this invention that the compounds<br>
provided may also be used to further study and elucidate<br>
the 5-HT6 receptor.<br>
These and other objects and features of the<br>
invention will become more apparent by the detailed<br>
description set forth hereinbelow.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The 5-hydroxytryptamine-6 (5-HT6) receptor is<br>
one of the most recent receptors to be identified by<br>
molecular cloning. Its ability to bind a wide range of<br>
therapeutic compounds used in psychiatry, coupled with<br>
its intriguing distribution in the brain has stimulated<br>
significant interest in new compounds which are capable<br>
of interacting with or affecting said receptor.<br>
Significant efforts are being made to understand the<br>
possible role of the 5-HT6 receptor in psychiatry,<br>
cognitive dysfunction, motor function and control,<br>
memory, mood and the like. To that end, compounds which<br>
demonstrate a binding affinity for the 5-HT6 receptor are<br>
earnestly sought both as an aid in the study of the 5-HT6<br>
receptor and as potential therapeutic agents in the<br>
treatment of central nervous system disorders, for<br>
example see C. Reavill and D. C. Rogers, Current Opinion<br>
in Investigational Drugs, 2001, 2(1):104-109, Pharma<br>
Press Ltd.<br>
Surprisingly, it has now been found that<br>
indolylalkylamine derivatives of formula I demonstrate 5-<br>
HT6 affinity. Advantageously, said amine derivatives may<br>
be used as effective therapeutic agents for the treatment<br>
of central nervous system (CNS) disorders associated with<br>
or affected by the 5-HT6 receptor. Accordingly, the<br>

This invention also provides processes for preparing<br>
compounds of formula (I), which processes comprise one of<br>
the following:<br>
a) reacting a compound of formula B<br><br>
wherein n, R1, R2,, R3, R4, R5, R6 and R7 are as defined<br>
herein, with an appropriate sulphonylating, acylating,<br>
carbamoylating or thiocarbamoylating agent containing the<br>
group:<br>
R4-Q-<br>
where R8 is as defined above and Q is S02, CO, CONR9 or<br>
CSNR10; said reactants protected on reactive sites and/or<br>
on reactive substituent groups as required, and removing<br>

to a corresponding compound of formula (I) wherein R5. and<br>
R6 are both H.<br>
Methods for carrying out the reactions described<br>
above are well known to those skilled in the art and/or<br>
are illustrated herein. In any of the reactions described<br>
herein reactive substituent groups or sites in the<br>
molecule may be protected prior to reaction by use of<br>
appropriate protecting groups inert to the reaction<br>
conditions and removed after the reaction.<br>
Compounds of the invention may be conveniently<br>
prepared using conventional synthetic methods and, if<br>
required, standard separation and isolation techniques.<br>
For example, compounds of formula I wherein Q is SO2, n is<br>
2 and R3 and R4 are H (Ia) may be prepared by sequentially<br>
reacting an indole derivative of formula I with oxalyl<br>
chloride and an amine, HNR5R6, to give the intermediate of<br>

formula IV derivative with a base such as potassium t-<br>
butoxide or sodium hydride followed by a sulfonyl<br>
chloride, R6SO2Cl, to give the desired formula la product.<br>
The reaction sequence is shown in flow diagram I.<br>
For intermediates of formula IV wherein R5 or R6 are<br>
H, the formula IV amine may be protected with a<br>
conventional protecting reagent such as di-t-butyl<br>
carbonate, prior to the final sulfonylation steps. The<br>
resulting N-protected formula I compound may then be<br>
deprotected in the presence of acid.<br>
Alternatively, compounds of formula la may be<br>
prepared by reacting a 3-(2-bromoethy1) derivative of<br>
formula V sequentially with a base and a sulfonyl<br>
chloride, R8SO2C1, to give the formula VI intermediate and<br>
reacting the formula VI intermediate with an amine, HNR5R6<br>
to give the desired product of formula Ia. The reaction<br>
steps are shown in flow diagram II<br><br>
Compounds of formula I wherein R3 or R4 are other<br>
than H and Q is SO2 (Ib) may be prepared by sequentially<br>
reacting the intermediate of formula II with a Grignard<br>
reagent, such as ethyl magnesium bromide, and an amino<br>
acid chloride of formula VII to give the 3-acylated<br>
compound of formula VIII; reducing said formula VIII<br>
compound with a reducing agent such as lithium aluminum<br>
hydride to give the corresponding 3-alkylamino compound<br>
of formula IX and sulfonating the formula IX compound as<br>
described hereinabove in flow diagrams I and II to afford<br>
the desired formula Ib product. The reaction sequence is<br>
shown in flow diagram III.<br><br>
In the case where R5 or R6 are H, the nitrogen atom<br>
of the amino acid chloride of formula VII is protected<br>
and the corresponding resultant product may be<br>
deprotected using conventional means to give the desired<br>
formula Ib compound wherein R5 or R6 are H.<br>
Compounds of formula I wherein Q is S02; n is 3; and<br>
R3, R4, R5, R6 and R7 are H (Ic) may be prepared by<br>
sequentially reacting an aryl hydrazine hydrochloride of<br>
formula X with 3,4-dihydro-2H-pyran to give the indol-3-<br>
yl-propanol-1-ol of formula XI; displacing the hydroxy<br>
group with bromine to give the corresponding bromo<br>
compound of formula XII; reacting the formula XII<br>
compound with sodium azide to form the azide of formula<br>
XIII; sulfonylating the formula XIII azide to give the<br>
compound of formula XIV and converting the formula XIV<br>
compound to the desired formula Ic amine via reaction<br>
with triphenylphosphine- The reaction sequence is shown<br>
in flow diagram IV.<br>
Similarly, compounds of formula I wherein Q is CO,<br>
CONR9 or CSR10 may be prepared using the above procedures '<br>
illustrated in flow diagrams I, II, III and IV and<br>
employing the appropriately substituted acid chloride,<br>
isocyanate or isothiocyanate in place of R8SO2Cl.<br>
Protecting groups useful in the reactions described<br>
hereinabove include t-butylcarboxylate, benzyl, acetyl,<br>
benzyloxycarbonyl, or any conventional group known to<br>
protect a basic nitrogen in standard synthetic<br>
procedures.<br>
Sulfonyl chlorides, R8SO2Cl, may be obtained<br>
commercially or prepared by conventional techniques. For<br>
example, 6-substituted-imidazo[2,1-b][1,3]thiazol-5-yl<br>
sulfonyl chlorides of formulas Xva and XVb may be<br>
prepared by reacting 2-amino thiazole with chloroacetic<br>
acid or a suitable chloromethyl ketone to give 2-imino-4-<br>
thiazolin-3-ylacetic acid (XVIa) or the 2-imino-4-<br>
thiazolin-3-yl ketone (XVIb), respectively; reacting<br>
either XVIa or XVIb with POC13 to give, in the case of<br>
XVIa, 6-chloroimidazo[2,l-b]thiazole (XVIIa) or, in the<br>
case of XVIb, 6-substituted-imidazo[2,1-b] thiazole<br>
XVIIb; and sequentially reacting the respective XVIIa and<br>
XVIIb compounds with chlorosulfonic acid and POCI3 to give<br>
the desired sulfonyl chlorides of formulas Xva and XVb.<br>
The reactions are illustrated in flow diagram V wherein R<br>
represents an optional substituent as described<br>
hereinabove with the exclusion of halogen.<br>
Advantageously, the present invention provides a<br>
method for the preparation of a compound of formula I<br>
wherein Q is SO2 and R5 and R6 are other than H (Id) which<br>
comprises reacting a compound of formula XVIII with a<br>
sulfonyl chloride, R8SO2Cl, in the presence of a base<br>
optionally in the presence of a solvent. The process is<br>
shown in flow diagram VI.<br>
Bases suitable for use in the method of invention<br>
are strong bases such as NaH, KOt-Bu, or any conventional<br>
base capable of removing a proton from a basic indole or<br>
benzazole nitrogen atom.<br>
Advantageously, the inventive compound of formula I<br>
may be utilized in the treatment of central nervous<br>

EXAMPLE 46<br>
Comparative Evaluation of 5-HT6 Binding Affinity of Test<br>
Compounds<br>
The affinity of test compounds for the serotonin 5-<br>
HT6 receptor is evaluated in the following manner.<br>
Cultured Hela cells expressing human cloned 5-HT6<br>
receptors are harvested and centrifuged at low speed<br>
(1,000 x g) for 10.0 min to remove the culture media. The<br>
harvested cells are suspended in half volume of fresh<br>
physiological phosphate buffered saline solution and<br>
recentrifuged at the same speed. This operation is<br>
repeated. The collected cells are then homogenized in ten<br>
volumes of 50 mM Tris.HCl (pH 7.4) and 0.5 mM EDTA. The<br>
homogenate is centrifuged at 40,000 x g for 30.0 min and<br>
the precipitate is collected. The obtained pellet is<br>
resuspended in 10 volumes of Tris.HCl buffer and<br>
recentrifuged at the same speed. The final pellet is<br>
suspended in a small volume of Tris.HCl buffer and the<br>
tissue protein content is determined in aliquots of 10-25<br>
ml volumes. Bovine Serum Albumin is used as the standard<br>
in the protein determination according to the method<br>
described in Lowry et al., J. Biol. Chem., 193:265<br>
(1951). The volume of the suspended cell membranes is<br>
adjusted to give a tissue protein concentration of 1.0<br>
mg/ml of suspension. The prepared membrane suspension<br>
(10 times concentrated) is aliquoted in 1.0 ml volumes<br>
and stored at -70° C until used in subsequent binding<br>
experiments.<br>
Binding experiments are performed in a 96 well<br>
microtiter plate format, in a total volume of 200 ml. To<br>
each well is added the following mixture: 80.0 ml of<br>
incubation buffer made in 50 mM Tris.HCl buffer (pH 7.4)<br>
containing 10.0 mM MgCl2 and 0.5 mM EDTA and 20 ml of<br>
[3H]-LSD (S.A., 86.0 Ci/mmol, available from Amersham Life<br>
Science), 3.0 nM. The dissociation constant, KD of the<br>
[3H]LSD at the human serotonin 5-HT6 receptor is 2.9 nM,<br>
as determined by saturation binding with increasing<br>
concentrations of [3H]LSD. The reaction is initiated by<br>
the final addition of 100.0 ml of tissue suspension.<br>
Nonspecific binding is measured in the presence of 10.0<br>
mM methiothepin. The test compounds are added in 20.0 ml<br>
volume.<br>
The reaction is allowed to proceed in the dark for<br>
120 min at room temperature, at which time, the bound<br>
ligand-receptor complex is filtered off on a 96 well<br>
unifilter with a Packard Filtermate® 196 Harvester. The<br>
bound complex caught on the filter disk is allowed to air<br>
dry and the radioactivity is measured in a Packard<br>
TopCount® equipped with six photomultiplier detectors,<br>
after the addition of 40.0ml Microscint®-20 scintillant<br>
to each shallow well. The unifilter plate is heat-sealed<br>
and counted in a PackardTopCount® with a tritium<br>
efficiency of 31.0%.<br>
Specific binding to the 5-HT6 receptor is defined as<br>
the total radioactivity bound less the amount bound in<br>
the presence of 10.0mM unlabeled methiothepin. Binding<br>
in the presence of varying concentrations of test<br>
compound is expressed as a percentage of specific binding<br>
in the absence of test compound. The results are plotted<br>
as log % bound versus log concentration of test compound.<br>
Nonlinear regression analysis of data points with a<br>
computer assisted program Prism® yielded both the IC50 and<br>
the K1 values of test compounds with 95% confidence<br>
limits. A linear regression line of data points is<br>
plotted, from which the IC50 value is determined and the<br>
KI value is determined based upon the following equation:<br>
KI = IC50 / (1 + L/KD)<br>
where L is the concentration of the radioactive ligand<br>
used and Kd is the dissociation constant of the ligand for<br>
the receptor, both expressed in nM.<br>
Using this assay, the following Ki values are<br>
determined and compared to those values obtained by<br>
representative compounds known to demonstrate binding to<br>
the 5-HT6 receptor. The data are shown in Table III,<br>
below.<br><br>
As can be seen from the results set forth above, the<br>
compounds of the present invention demonstrate<br>
significant affinity for the 5-HT6 receptor.<br>
