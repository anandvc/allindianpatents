				<td>Process for die gas-phase polymerization of olefins<br>
The present invention relates to a continuous process for the gas-phase polymerization of a-<br>
olefins carried out in the presence of a polymerization catalyst system, the process being able<br>
to prepare polyolefins having a reduced amount of fine polymer particles.<br>
In particular, the present invention relates to a gas-phase process wherein the polymerization<br>
catalyst system is first subjected to a prepolymerization step and the obtained prepolymer is<br>
successively fed to a gas-phase reactor having interconnected polymerization zones.<br>
The development of olefin polymerization catalysts with high activity and selectivity,<br>
particularly of the Ziegler-Natta type and, more recently, of the metallocene type, has led to<br>
the widespread use on an industrial scale of processes in which the polymerization of olefins<br>
is carried out in a gaseous medium in the presence of a solid catalyst.<br>
A widely used technology for gas-phase polymerization processes is the fluidized bed<br>
technology as well as the stirred bed technology. When the gas-phase polymerization of one<br>
or more olefins is carried out in a fluidized or mechanically stirred bed reactor, the polymer is<br>
obtained in the form of granules having a more or less regular morphology, depending on the<br>
morphology of the catalyst: the dimensions of the granules depend on the dimensions of the<br>
catalyst particles and on reaction conditions and are generally distributed around an average<br>
value.<br>
In the conventional stirred or fluidized gas-phase reactors the heat of polymerization is<br>
removed by means of a heat exchanger placed inside the reactor or in the recycle line of the<br>
unreacted monomers. The reacting polymer bed consists of polymer particles with a defined<br>
geometrical shape and a granulomere distribution preferably narrow, generally distributed<br>
over values higher than 500 |im. However, a detrimental problem commonly to be faced in<br>
these polymerization processes is given by the presence of a significant amount of fine<br>
polymer particles. These fine particles arc cither derived from already existing fine catalyst<br>
particles or produced from the breakage of portions of the catalyst itself. Said fine particles<br>
tend to deposit ouo and to electrostatically adhere to the pipes of the heat exchanger, as well<br>
as to deposit onto and electrostatically adhere to the inner walls of the polymerization reactor.<br>
Thereafter the fine particles grow in size by chemical reaction, thus causing an insulating<br>
effect and a lower heat transfer resulting in the formation of hot spots in the reactor.<br>
These negative effects are even enhanced when the gas-phase olefin polymerization is carried<br>
out in the presence of highly active catalyst systems, such as those comprising the reaction<br><br>
product of an aluminum alkyl compound with a titanium compound supported on a magnesium halide in an active form.<br>
As a consequence, a loss in the efficiency and homogeneity of the fluidization conditions of the polymer bed generally occurs. For example, the clogging of the polymer discharge system may occur. Moreover, the temperature excess caused by hot spots in the reactor can result in particles melting with the consequent formation of polymer lumps, which may clog the gas distribution plate placed at the bottom of the fluidized polymer bed. All these drawbacks lead to a poor process stability and can lead to a forced interruption of the polymerization run in order to remove the deposits which have formed inside the reactor or into the gas recycle line even after relatively short times.<br>
Several solutions have been proposed to avoid these drawbacks, either by acting on the catalyst activity or, as an alternative, by reducing or eliminating the electrostatic voltage inside the polymer bed.<br>
EP 359 444 and US 4,739,015 describe the introduction into the polymerization reactor of small amounts of an inhibitor in order to reduce the olefin polymerization rate. Among the polymerization inhibitors, ethanol, methanol, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol and diethylene glycol are cited. These compounds must be used in an amount of few ppm with respect to the polymer in order not to deactivate the catalyst: at such low concentrations they are not effective as to a selective deactivation of the fine catalyst particles, whereas at higher concentrations the polymerization does not take place.<br>
Alternative techniques have been proposed, aimed at reducing or eliminating the electrostatic voltage responsible for the phenomena of migration and formation of polymer deposits on the reactor walls. For instance, in US 4,803,251 a group of chemical additives is described generating both positive and negative charges in the polymer bed. These additives arc fed to the reactor in an amount of few ppm per part of monomer in order to prevent the formation of undesired positive or negative charges. The use of antistatic agents is also taught by EP 232 701 in a process for the preparation of ultra high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE). The claimed antistatic agents prevent the formation of crusts inside the reactor, but the ethylene polymers have a rather low bulk density and the films obtained therefrom show impurities in the form of unmcltcd products.<br>
Other processes for reducing the electrostatic voltage include: (1) installation of grounding devices in the fluidized bed; (2) ionization of gas or particles by electrical discharge to generate ions, which neutralize electrostatic charges onto the particles; (3) the use of<br><br>
radioactive sources to produce radiation capable of generating ions which neutralize<br>
electrostatic charges onto the particles. However, the application of these techniques on<br>
industrial scale in a fluidized bed polymerization reactor is generally neither practical nor<br>
easy.<br>
A novel gas-phase polymerization process, which represents a gas-phase technology<br>
alternative to the fluidized bed reactor technology, as to the preparation of olefin polymers, is<br>
disclosed in the Applicant's earlier EP-B-1012195. The described polymerization process is<br>
earned out in a gas-phase reactor having interconnected polymerization zones, where the<br>
growing polymer particles flow through a first polymerization zone (riser) under fast<br>
fluidization or transport conditions, leave said riser and enter a second polymerization zone<br>
(downcomer) through which they flow in a densified form under the action of gravity, leave<br>
said downcomer and are reintroduced into the riser, thus establishing a circulation of polymer<br>
between the two polymerization zones.<br>
It is now felt the need of minimizing the total amounts of fine polymer particles produced in<br>
said reactor, thus improving the particle size distribution of the polyolefins prepared by means<br>
of the above gas-^hase technology.<br>
The Applicant has surprising found that the prepolymerization of the catalyst system, as well<br>
as the modality of feeding the prepolymer to the polymerization zones of said gas-phase<br>
reactor can have a remarkable influence on the final particle size distribution of die obtained<br>
polyolcfin powders. In particular, the Applicant has unexpectedly found that carrying out the<br>
prepolymerization step according to suitable operating conditions and feeding the prepolymer<br>
in a particular manner allows minimizing the formation of fine polymer particles inside the<br>
gas-phase polymerization reactor.<br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention providing a process for the gas-phase<br>
polymerization of one or more alpha-olcfins in the presence of a catalyst system, the process<br>
comprising:<br>
a)	contacting in a continuous way one or more of said alpha-olcfins with said catalyst system in a prepolymerization reactor, wherein the reaction is carried out in a liquid medium at a temperature ranging from 23Â° to 50Â°C;<br>
b)	feeding in continuous the prepolymer obtained from step a) into a gas-phase reactor having interconnected polymerization zones, where the growing polymer particles flow upward through a first polymerization zone (riser) under fast fluidization or transport conditions, leave said riser and enter a second polymerization zone<br><br>
(downcomer) through which they flow downward under the action of gravity, leave said downcomer and are reintroduced into the riser, thus establishing a circulation of polymer between the riser and the downcomer, wherein the prepolymer obtained from step a) is continuously fed at a section of said riser characterized by an upwardly gas velocity higher than 3.0 m/s.<br>
The polymerization process of the present invention allows achieving an optimal particle size distribution of the obtained polyolefin powders. In fact, the percentage of fine powders is minimized with respect to the case of conventional polymerization into a stirred or fluidized gas-phase reactor. The particle size is generally distributed between 0.2 and S.O mm, with most of particles naving an average size in the range 1.5-3.0 mm.<br>
Defining as "fines" the polymer particles smaller than 0.3 mm, the total amount of fines formed in the polymerization process of the present invention is generally less than 0.25% by weight. This represents a considerable advantage with respect to the conventional gas-phase or liquid-phase polymerization processes, where the total amount of powders with an average size of less than 0.3 mm is generally around 1.0-3.0%.<br>
According to the process of the invention, the prepolymerization step a) is carried out in a liquid medium in whatever type of reactor. Therefore, continuous stirred tank reactors (CSTR) as well as loop reactors can be used for contacting the olefin monomers with the polymerization catalyst system. However, the prepolymerization treatment is preferably carried out into a liquid loop reactor.<br>
As regards the polymerization catalyst system fed to step a), highly active catalyst systems of the Ziegler-Natta or metallocene type can be used.<br>
A Ziegler-Natta catalyst system comprises the catalysts obtained by the reaction of a transition metal compound of Ti, V, Zr, Cr, and Hf with an organomctallic compound of group 1,2, or 13 of the Periodic Tabic of clement<br>
A mctalloccnc-bascd catalyst system comprises at least a transition metal compound containing at least one JI bond and at least an alumoxanc or a compound able to form an alkylmctalloccnc cation; optionally  on organo-aluminum compound.<br>
The liquid medium of step a) comprises liquid alpha-olefin monomers), optionally with the addition of an inert hydrocarbon solvent Said hydrocarbon solvent can be either aromatic, such as toluene, or aliphatic, such as propane, hexane, heptane, isobutane, cyclohexane and 2,2,4-trimcthylpcntane. The amount of hydrocarbon solvent, if any, is lower than 40% by weight with respect to the amount of alpha-olefins, preferably lower than 20% by weight. Preferably step a)<br><br>
is carried out in the absence of inert hydrocarbon solvents (bulk polymerization).<br>
The prepolymenration step a) is preferably carried out in the absence of any molecular weight<br>
regulator, such as hydrogen. Alternatively, in some cases, a limited amount of hydrogen can<br>
be fed to the prepolymerization reactor, on condition that said amount is not higher than 2000<br>
ppm by vol. referred to the total amount of liquid monomer. As a consequence, the<br>
prepolymer obtained from step a) is characterized by a high molecular weight distribution: the<br>
intrinsic viscosity of said prepolymer generally ranges between 2.0 and 6.0 dl/g.<br>
The average residence time in step a) of the invention is the ratio between the volume of the<br>
prepolymerization reactor and the volumetric rate of the polymeric slurry discharged from<br>
said reactor. This parameter generally ranges from 2 to 40 minutes and can be modified by an<br>
increase or a decrease of the output of the polymeric slurry from the prepolymerizator. Said<br>
residence time preferably ranges from 10 to 25 minutes.<br>
As above stated, the operating temperature in step a) generally ranges from 23 to 50Â°C and a<br>
preferred range is comprised between 27 and 40Â°C. It has been proven (see the comparative<br>
examples) that a prepolymerization temperature of less than 23 Â°C fails in giving the<br>
advantages of the process of the present invention. In fact, if step a) is carried out at a lower<br>
temperature, a significant increase of the total amount of fines formed in the successive<br>
polymerization step b) is caused.<br>
The polymerization degree of the prepolymerized catalyst system ranges preferably from 60<br>
to 800 g per gram of solid catalyst component, preferably from 150 to 400 g per gram of solid<br>
catalyst component. A polymeric slurry containing the prepolymerized catalyst system is<br>
discharged from the prepolymerization reactor before to be continuously fed to the<br>
polymerization step b).<br>
Step b) is carried out into a gas-phase reactor, as described in the Applicant's earlier EP 782<br>
587 and EP 1 012 195, where the polymerization of one or more olefins is carried out in two<br>
interconnected polymerization zones. In the first polymerization zone, hereinafter indicated as<br>
the "riser", fast flutdization conditions arc imposed: this means that the velocity of the<br>
fluidizing gas is higher than the transport velocity of the polymer particles. The terms<br>
"transport velocity" and "fast fluidisation state" are well known in the art; for a definition<br>
thereof, see, for example, "D. Geldart, Gas Fluidisation Technology, page 155 et seq., J.<br>
Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd., 1986".<br>
The riser operates under fast fluidized bed conditions with gas superficial velocities higher<br>
than the average particles terminal velocities, so that the polymer particles are entrained<br><br>
upwards by the flow of the reacting monomers. A highly turbulent flow regime is established into the riser: this generates a good heat exchange coefficient between the single particles and the surrounding gas, and also ensures that the reaction temperature is kept reasonably constant along the reaction bed. Generally, the velocity of the fluidizing gas injected into the riser depends on the gas density and the particle size distribution of the solid. This upwardly gas velocity can be generally comprised between 0.5 and 15 m/s, preferably between 0.8 and 5 m/s.<br>
In the second polymerization zone, hereinafter indicated as the "downcomer", the growing polymer particles flow downward in a densified form under the action of gravity. The high density of the solid, which approaches the bulk density of the polymer, is the relevant feature of the second polymerization zone. In this zone a positive gain in pressure can be obtained along the direction of flow, so that it becomes possible to reintroduce the polymer into the riser without the help of special mechanical means. In this way, a "loop" circulation is set up, which is defined by die balance of pressures between the two polymerization zones and by the head losses introduced into the system.<br>
According to the process of the invention, the polymeric slurry containing the prepolymerized<br>
catalyst system is continuously fed into the riser at a section thereof having an upwardly gas<br>
velocity higher than 3.0 m/s, preferably in the range from 5.0 m/s to 15 m/s.<br>
Gas velocities higher than 3.0 m/s ensure an optimal heat exchange coefficient between the<br>
injected prcpolymer particles and the surrounding reacting gas, thus significantly reducing the<br>
chance of breakage of the prepolymer just introduced into the riser. As above indicated, step<br>
a) is preferably carried out at a temperature comprised between 27 and 40Â°C, while the<br>
polymerization in step b) is generally performed at temperature s in the range from 60 to<br>
120Â°C. Therefore, when fed into the riser, the liquid monomer impregnating the pores of the<br>
prcpolymcr is suddenly introduced into a highly reactive ambient, where it is subjected to a<br>
high reactivity with a consequent development of heat generated from the polymerization<br>
reaction. This thermal stress could cause the breakage of the prcpolymcr particles with the<br>
consequent formation of particles smaller than 0.3 mm (fines). As shown by the comparative<br>
examples, when the prcpolymcr is fed to a section of riser characterized by a gas velocity<br>
lower than 3 m/s, u considerable increase of the amount of fines is caused.<br>
According to a first embodiment of the present invention, the section of the riser is uniform<br>
along its height, so that the gas velocity does not substantially change throughout the riser. In<br>
this case, the advantages of the invention in term of particle size distribution, i.e.<br><br>
minimization of fine particles, can be achieved by feeding the prepolymcrized catalyst system<br>
at whatever section along the height of the riser maintaining the gas velocity higher than 3<br>
m/s.<br>
According to a second and preferred embodiment, the section of the riser is not uniform along<br>
its height, but it narrows and widens due to the presence of one or more restrictions. In this<br>
case the velocity of the upwardly fluidizing gas changes along the height of the riser. The<br>
prepolymcrized catalyst system can be suitably fed in correspondence of those sections<br>
characterized by a gas velocity higher than 3 m/s, while in the remaining sections of the riser<br>
the gas velocity can be also maintained at a value lower than 3 m/s. The prepolymeric slurry<br>
coming from step a) is preferably fed in correspondence of the bottom part of the riser, where<br>
the riser section is designed narrower than the remaining portion of riser.<br>
Moreover, depending on the aimed olefita (copolymer, the polymerization step b) can be<br>
carried out by properly adjusting the polymerization  conditions  and the monomers<br>
concentration in the two polymerization zones, so as to produce a wide variety of bimodal<br>
homopolymers and random copolymers. To this purpose, in step b) the gas mixture entraining<br>
the polymer particles and coming from the riser can be partially or totally prevented from<br>
entering the downcomer, so as to obtain two different gas composition zones. This can be<br>
achieved by feeding a gas and/or a liquid mixture into the downcomer through a line placed at<br>
a suitable point of the downcomer, preferably in the upper part thereof. Said gas and/or liquid<br>
mixture should have a suitable composition, different from that of the gas mixture present in<br>
the riser. The flow of said gas and/or liquid mixture may be regulated so that an upward flow<br>
of gas counter-current to the flow of the polymer particles is generated, particularly at the top<br>
thereof, acting as a barrier to the gas mixture coming from the riser.<br>
The present invention will be now described in detail with reference to Figure 1, which is<br>
illustrative and not limitative of the scope of the present invention.<br>
According to the embodiment shown in Fig. 1 the prcpolymcrization treatment of the catalyst<br>
system (step a) is carried out in a loop reactor, while the polymerization step b) is carried out<br>
in a gas-phase reactor having interconnected polymerization zones, the riser having a<br>
restriction at the bottom part<br>
A solid catalyst component 1, a cocatalyst 2 and optionally a donor compound, are fed to a<br>
pre-contacting vessel 3 together with a diluent, such as propane. These components are<br>
contacted in the vessel 3 at room temperature for a time of 5-60 minutes.<br>
The formed catalyst system is fed via line 4 to a loop prepolymerization reactor 5 to cany out<br><br>
step a) according to the above-stated operating conditions. A a-olefin is fed to the loop reactor<br>
5 via line 6.<br>
A slurry containing the particles of prepolymer is discharged from the loop reactor S and is<br>
fed via line 7 to the riser 8 of a gas-phase reactor having two interconnected polymerization<br>
zones, wherein the polymerization step b) is carried out according to the above-stated<br>
operating conditions. In particular, the prepolymerized catalyst system is fed via line 7 to a<br>
restricted section 9 of said riser 8, where the fluidizing gas velocity is advantageously<br>
maintained at a value higher than 3 m/s.<br>
The gas-phase reactor comprises a riser 8 and a downcomer 11, wherein the polymer particles<br>
flow, respectively, upward under fast fluidization condition along the direction of the arrow<br>
13 and downward under the action of gravity along the direction of the arrow 14. The riser 8<br>
and the downcomer 11 are appropriately interconnected by the interconnection bends 10 and<br>
12.<br>
In said gas-phase reactor one or more olefin monomers are polymerized in the presence of<br>
hydrogen as the molecular weight regulator. To this aim, a gaseous mixture comprising the<br>
monomers, hydrogen and propane, as an inert diluent, is fed to the reactor through one or<br>
more lines IS, suitably placed at any point of the recycling system according to the<br>
knowledge of those skilled in art<br>
After flowing through the riser 8, the polymer particles and the gaseous mixture leave the riser<br>
8 and are conveyed to a solid/gas separation zone 16. This solid/gas separation can be effected by<br>
using conventional separation means such as, for example, a centrifugal separator (cyclone) of<br>
the axial, spiral, helical or tangential type.<br>
From the separation zone 16, the polymer enters the downcomer 11. The gaseous mixture<br>
leaving die separation zone 16 is recycled to the riser 8 by means of a recycle line 17, equipped<br>
with means for the compression 18 and cooling 19.<br>
After the compression means 18 and the cooling means 19, the recycle gas is divided into two<br>
separated streams, the first one is transferred to the connecting section 12 via the line 20 to favor<br>
the transfer of the polymer particles from the downcomcr 11 to the riser 8. The second stream of<br>
recycle gas is fed via line 21 at the bottom of the riser 8 to establish inside the restricted section 9<br>
the fluidization conditions as claimed in the present application.<br>
When polymers with a different composition or polymers with a bimodal molecular weight<br>
distribution are wished to be prepared in the polymerization step b), a part of the recycle gas of<br>
line 17 is sent via line 22 to a condenser 23, where the gaseous stream is cooled at a temperature<br><br>
involving the partial condensation of the monomers and the inert gases, such as propane. A separating vessel 24 is placed downstream the condenser 23. The gaseous mixture enriched in hydrogen, which collects at the top of the vessel 24 is recycled via line 25 to the recycle line 17. On the contrary, the condensed liquid is fed to the downcomer 11 via line 26. Said liquid can be fed to said downcomer 11 by gravity by placing the vessel 24 at a convenient height or by any other suitable mt^ns, such as a pump 27.<br>
The make-up components that are wished to be present in the downcomer 11 can be fed as a liquid via line 28. Line 26 for feeding the liquid barrier is placed in the upper part of the downcomer 11 and allows partially or totally preventing the gas mixture coming from the riser 8 from entering the downcomer 11, so as to obtain two different gas composition zones, as previously explained.<br>
The polymer obtained from the gas-phase reactor of step b) is discharged from the lower part of the downcomer 11 via the discharge line 29.<br>
The gas-phase polymerization process of the invention allows the preparation of a large number of olefin powders having an optimal particle size distribution with a low content of fines. Examples of polymers that can be obtained are:<br>
high-density polyethylenes (HDPEs having relative densities higher than 0.940) including ethylene homopolymers and ethylene copolymers with a-olefins having 3 to 12 carbon atoms;<br>
linear polyethylenes of low density (LLDPEs having relative densities lower than 0.940) and of very low density and ultra low density (VLDPEs and ULDPEs having relative densities lower than 0.920 down to 0.880) consisting of ethylene copolymers with one or more a-olcfins having 3 to 12 carbon atoms;<br>
elastomer; J tcrpolymcrs of ethylene and propylene with minor proportions of diene or clastomcric copolymers of ethylene and propylene with a content of units derived from ethylene of between about 30 and 70% by weight;<br>
isotactic polypropylene and crystalline copolymers of propylene and ethylene and/or other a-olcfins having a content of units derived from propylene of more than 85% by weight;<br>
isotactic copolymers of propylene and a-olefins, such as 1-butene, with an a-olefin content of up to 30% by weight;<br>
impact-resistant propylene polymers obtained by sequential polymerisation of propylene and mixtures of propylene with ethylene containing up to 30% by weight of<br><br>
ethylene;<br>
atactic polypropylene and amorphous copolymers of propylene and ethylene and/or other a-olefins containing more than 70% by weight of units derived from propylene;<br>
polybutadiene and other polydiene rubbers. The above gas-phase polymerisation process can be carried out in the presence of a highly active catalyst system of the Ziegler-Natta or metallocene type.<br>
A Ziegler-Natta catalyst system comprises the catalysts obtained by the reaction of a transition metal compound of groups 4 to 10 of the Periodic Table of Elements (new notation) with an organometallic compound of group 1,2, or 13 of the Periodic Table of element. In particular, the transition metal compound can be selected among compounds of Ti, V, Zr, Cr, and Hf. Preferred compounds are those of formula Ti(OR)nXy in which n is comprised between 0 and y, y is the valence of titanium; X is halogen and R is a hydrocarbon group having 1-10 carbon atoms or a COR group. Among them, particularly preferred are titanium compounds having at least one Ti-halogen bond such as titanium tetrahalides or halogenalcoholates.
