				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
	The present invention relates generally to graphic processing and more<br>
particularly, but not by way of limitation, to a method and system for producing high-<br>
quality anti-aliased graphic pictures at high frame rates with low computational cost.<br>
HISTORY OF RELATED ART<br>
	Real-time rendering of three-dimensional graphics has a number of appealing<br>
applications on mobile terminals, including games, man-machine interfaces, messaging,<br>
and e-commerce. Since three-dimensional rendering is typically a computationally<br>
expensive task, dedicated hardware must often be built to achieve acceptable performance.<br>
Innovative ways of lowering the computations complexity and bandwidth usage of this<br>
hardware architecture are thus of great importance. As described in Akenine-Moller,<br>
Tomas and Jacob Stro'm, "Graphics for the Masses: A Hardware Architecture for Mobile<br>
Phones," ACM Transactions on Graphics, vol. 22, no. 3, Proceedings of ACM SIGGRAPH<br>
2003, pp. 801-808, July 2003, it has been shown that the average eye-to-pixel angle is<br>
about 2-4 greater for a mobile phone than for a personal computer (PC). Thus, the image<br>
quality on mobile devices should ideally be greater than for PCs. However, mobile<br>
devices typically have fewer and less-powerful computational resources.<br>
	Since the early days of computer graphics, aliasing has been a problem when<br>
presenting still or moving pictures on a display. An example of aliasing is the stair-step<br>
effect that is visible on display terminals when a line is drawn at an angle. These stair-step<br>
artifacts are commonly referred to as "jaggies". During three-dimensional rendering,<br>
edges of polygons often produce noticeable aliasing artifacts. It is desirable to reduce<br>
these artifacts using anti-aliasing techniques.<br>
	One approach to reducing the artifacts in pictures due to aliasing is to use what<br>
is known as supersampling. In a supersampling approach, a scene is sampled in more than<br>
one point per pixel to be displayed and the final image is computed from the samples. As<br>
2<br><br><br>
a special case of supersampling, multisampling techniques also sample the scene in more<br>
than one point per pixel, but the results of fragment shader computations (e.g. texture and<br>
color) are shared between the samples in a pixel. A multisampling algorithm, in general,<br>
is one that takes more than one sample per pixel in a single pass, and shares computations<br>
among the samples for a grid cell.<br>
	In the supersampling approach to anti-aliasing, a picture is rendered at a higher<br>
resolution than the final resolution that is displayed on the screen, resulting in more than<br>
one sample per pixel. The samples for each pixel are then averaged, for example, to form<br>
the color of the pixel. This is done by rendering multiple sub-pixel samples for each pixel<br>
to be displayed, and computing the value of each pixel as a weighted sum of the sub-pixel<br>
sample values. For example, each displayed pixel may be comprised of a filtered,<br>
weighted sum of a group of four sub-pixel samples inside the pixel.<br>
	As a consequence of the supersampling approach, the graphics hardware must<br>
process four times as many samples for each displayed pixel. This method of anti-aliasing<br>
is often referred to as brute-force supersampling. Brute-force supersampling increases the<br>
quality of the image greatly, but comes at a high penalty in terms of memory and<br>
rendering time. For example, assume that the width and height of a target image is w x h.<br>
If a resolution of 2w x 2 h is used for brute-force supersampling, then four samples per<br>
pixel are used, and four times as much memory, as well as four times the rasterization<br>
time, is required. Although supersampling provides good picture quality, it may result in a<br>
low frame rate due to a heavy computational burden.<br>
	In order to lower the computational burden for producing anti-aliased pixels, a<br>
modified supersampling scheme may be used in which sub-pixel sample locations are<br>
placed in positions so that the value of one or more of the sample locations may be used<br>
for calculating the final value for more than one pixel. A supersampling scheme of this<br>
kind is often referred to as a sample-sharing scheme. By sharing samples, it is possible to<br>
obtain less than four samples per pixel. Multisampling can sometimes be used to further<br>
reduce bandwidth requirements, since part of the computations may be shared by all<br>
samples inside a pixel.<br>
3<br><br><br>
	The GeForce3™ graphics processing unit from NVIDIA Corporation, Santa<br>
Clara, USA provides hardware that supports supersampling and sharing of subsamples<br>
between pixels. A supersampling scheme is referred to as "Quincunx" presents a sub-pixel<br>
sample pattern in the form of a "5" on a die (i.e., five sub-pixel samples are used for<br>
calculating the value of the final pixel). Due to the placing of the sample locations in the<br>
Quincunx scheme, only two samples per pixel need to be calculated. The rest of the<br>
sample values are obtained from neighboring pixels. A center sub-pixel sample is given a<br>
weight of 0.5, while peripheral sub-pixel samples are given a weight of 0.125 each.<br>
Information regarding the Quincunx scheme may be found in "Technical Brief, HRAA:<br>
High-Resolution Antialiasing through Multisampling" from NVIDIA Corporation.<br>
	A number of gray levels between black and white in a monochrome scheme<br>
depends on how many pixel sample points are used. In an example in which four pixel<br>
sample locations are used, there will at best be three gray shades between black and white.<br>
Consequently, the Quincunx scheme described above at best provides four shades of gray.<br>
However, the effective number of gray shades for the Quincunx scheme may be as low as<br>
two. In the Quincunx scheme, the sample points form lines in vertical, horizontal, and 45°<br>
directions, which causes the Quincunx scheme to perform worse than some other schemes<br>
for some line orientations.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
	The present invention seeks to provide a method and apparatus for producing<br>
high-quality anti-aliased pictures at a low computational cost. One embodiment of the<br>
present invention is directed to a method for reducing aliasing. The method includes the<br>
step of sampling a pixel of an image at a plurality of pixel sample points to produce a<br>
corresponding plurality of pixel sample values, wherein at least one of the plurality of<br>
pixel sample points is located at a predetermined displacement from a position along an<br>
edge of the pixel. The method further includes combining the plurality of pixel sample<br>
values to produce a displayed pixel value. In an embodiment of the invention the<br>
predetermined displacement is determined using a lookup table. In still another<br>
4<br><br><br>
embodiment of the invention the predetermined displacement is determined pseudo-<br>
randomly.<br>
	Another embodiment of the present invention is directed to a system for<br>
reducing aliasing including a sample buffer adapted to store an image, and a processor<br>
adapted to perform pixel sampling at a plurality of pixel sample points to produce a<br>
corresponding plurality of pixel sample values, wherein at least one of the plurality of<br>
pixel sample points is located at a predetermined displacement from a position along an<br>
edge of a pixel. The processor is further adapted to combine the plurality of pixel sample<br>
values to produce at least one displayed pixel value.<br>
	Another embodiment of the present invention is directed to an article of<br>
manufacture including at least one computer readable medium and processor instructions<br>
contained on the at least one computer readable medium, the processor instructions<br>
configured to be readable from the at least one computer readable medium by at least one<br>
processor and thereby cause the at least one processor to operate so as to sample a pixel of<br>
an image at a plurality of pixel sample points to produce a corresponding plurality of pixel<br>
sample values, wherein at least one of the plurality of pixel sample points is located within<br>
a predetermined displacement from a position along an edge of the pixel. The processor<br>
instructions further cause the at least one processor to operate so as to combine the<br>
plurality of pixel sample values to produce a displayed pixel value.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS OF THE<br>
INVENTION<br>
	Embodiment(s) of the invention will now be described more fully with<br>
reference to the accompanying Drawings. The invention may, however, be embodied in<br>
many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiment(s) set<br>
forth herein. The invention should only be considered limited by the claims as they now<br>
exist and the equivalents thereof.<br>
	Various embodiments of the present invention serve to reduce anti-aliasing<br>
artifacts by providing a non-periodic pixel sampling pattern. The non-periodic pixel<br>
sampling pattern can cause no particular angle of edges to be more prone to having '<br>
aliasing artifacts. Various embodiments of the present invention serve to eliminate the<br>
6<br><br><br>
need to implement a reflection rule for neighboring pixels and require only that a sample<br>
placed on a pixel edge be shared by a neighboring pixel sharing the pixel edge.<br>
Accordingly, no other pixel needs to be dependent upon that sample.<br>
	Referring now to FIGURE 1 A, a pixel sampling pattern for eight pixels 101a-<br>
10lh is illustrated. The pixel sampling pattern of FIGURE 1A shows nine pixel sample<br>
points 104-112 located on the edges of the pixels l0la-l0lh. For purposes of clarity, any<br>
pixel samples that may lie on horizontal pixel edges are not illustrated. The pixel<br>
sampling pattern of FIGURE 1A possesses a periodicity of two as the pixel sampling<br>
pattern is repeated for every two pixels.<br>
	Referring now to FIGURE IB, a pixel sampling pattern in accordance with an<br>
embodiment of the present invention is illustrated. The pixel sampling pattern of FIGURE<br>
IB shows nine pixel sample points 104'-112' located on the edges of the pixels 101a'-<br>
101h'. For purposes of clarity, any pixel samples that may lie on horizontal pixel edges<br>
are not illustrated. In FIGURE IB, the pixel sample point 105' is displaced by a<br>
predetermined offset along the shared edge of pixels 101a' and 101b' so that it is not at a<br>
same vertical distance along a pixel edge as any of the other pixel sample points 104' and<br>
106'-112'. The distance that the pixel sample point 105' is displaced can be determined by<br>
any of a number of methods or algorithms. In one option, a distance that the pixel sample<br>
point 105' is displaced can be determined by a lookup from a table for one or more pixels<br>
for which the anti-aliasing scheme is to be performed. In still another option, the amount<br>
of offset can be determined pseudo-randomly. The displacement of the pixel sample point<br>
105' produces a non-periodic pixel sampling pattern. In still another option, one or more<br>
of any of the pixel sample points 104'-112' may be displaced by a predetermined distance<br>
along a pixel edge with the requirement that sample points placed on pixel edges are<br>
shared by a neighboring pixel sharing that pixel edge.<br>
	Referring now to FIGURE 2A, a pixel sampling pattern for eight pixels 201a-<br>
20 lh is illustrated. The pixel sampling pattern of FIGURE 2A shows nine pixel sample<br>
points 204-212 located on the edges of the pixels 201a-201h. For purposes of clarity, any<br>
pixel samples that may lie on horizontal pixel edges are not illustrated. The pixel<br>
7<br><br><br>
sampling pattern of FIGURE 2 A possesses a periodicity of three as the pixel sampling<br>
pattern is repeated for every three pixels. Referring now to FIGURE 2B, an embodiment<br>
of the present invention is illustrated in which every sample in a pixel sampling pattern is<br>
positioned at a predetermined offset along an edge of a pixel, or within a predetermined<br>
interval along an edge of a pixel. FIGURE 2B illustrates a pixel sampling pattern for eight<br>
pixels 201a'-201h'. The pixel sampling pattern of FIGURE 2B shows nine pixel sample<br>
points 204'-212' located on edges of the pixels 201a'-201d' and 202a'-202d'. Each of the<br>
pixel sample points 204'-212' is positioned at a predetermined point inside a predetermined<br>
interval of a pixel edge. In one option, the pixel sample points 204'-212' are pseudo-<br>
randomly positioned inside a predetermined interval of a pixel edge. In another option,<br>
the pixel sample points 204'-212' are positioned at a predetermined offset read from a<br>
lookup table such that the pixel sampling pattern does not repeat over at least two pixels.<br>
	FIGURE 2B illustrates a predetermined interval associated with each of the<br>
pixel sample points 204'-212', with each predetermined interval being represented by a<br>
bracket. Through use of displacement of pixel sample points, a virtually infinite<br>
periodicity, within the limitations of a lookup table or a pseudo-random generator used to<br>
produce the displacements, of the pixel sampling pattern is produced, which results in an<br>
improved breakup of symmetry along line edges and provides better visual quality in an<br>
anti-aliased image. Although the predetermined intervals of pixel sample points 204'-212'<br>
are illustrated as extending along only a portion of a pixel edge, it should be understood<br>
that the predetermined intervals can extend along the entire length of the pixel edge so that<br>
a particular pixel sample point can be located anywhere along the pixel edge. It should<br>
also be understood that pixel sample points need not be located precisely on a pixel edge,<br>
but may instead be located near a pixel edge, for example at a distance of one-third of a<br>
pixel width from a pixel edge. It should be understood that additional pixel sample points<br>
may be located within each pixel.<br>
	FIGURES 3A and 3B illustrate a super-sampling scheme in which pixel sample<br>
points 303-306 are placed at the edges of a pixel 301, and pixel sample points 307-310 are<br>
placed at the edges of a pixel 302. This allows for pixel sample sharing between the pixel<br>
301 and the pixel 302 in display memory if the pixel 301 and pixel 302 are positioned<br>
8<br><br><br>
adjacent to one another. In the super-sampling scheme of FIGURES 3 A and 3B, the<br>
samples are not placed in the comers of the pixel 301,302 as with the Quincunx scheme.<br>
Instead, one pixel sample point is defined for each edge of the pixel 301, 302 in a rotated<br>
square-shaped configuration and is given a weight of 0.25 each. It should be understood<br>
that other weights can be used for weighting each sample point as well.<br>
	Equations for determining the precise pixel sample locations are shown below<br>
FIGURES 3 A and 3B, respectively. In the equations of FIGURES 3 A and 3B, the terms<br>
xO and yO represent an origin point of an x-axis ("x") and a y-axis ("y"), respectively as<br>
illustrated in FIGURES 3A and 3B.<br>
	Placement of the pixel sample points 303-310 as shown provides for a sampling<br>
pattern in which a relatively small number of pixel sample points are necessary. In<br>
addition, the sampling pattern provides the feature of that each sample point is located on<br>
a unique row and column of a pixel, i.e., no two pixel samples share the same column or<br>
row for a particular pixel. This is illustrated in FIGURES 3A &amp; 3B by dashed lines<br>
wherein no two points lie on the same dashed line. The sampling pattern also serves to<br>
break the symmetry of the pixel sampling pattern configuration, which provides for an<br>
increase in the anti-aliasing effect of non-axial lines of a display, non-axial lines being<br>
lines which do not lie parallel to the horizontal axis or the vertical axes of the display. The<br>
anti-aliasing effect is even greater for lines which are near to being vertical or near to<br>
being horizontal with respect to the display. For example, assume a near to horizontal<br>
oriented edge of a polygon that is drawn on a display across one or more pixels of 301,<br>
302. If, for example, the Quincunx scheme is used for producing an anti-aliased line<br>
representation, four sample points, one in each corner of the pixel, will be used. For some<br>
pixels, the polygon edge will cover only the top portion of a pixel, but will still cover the<br>
two uppermost pixel sample locations. Consequently, by examining the values from the<br>
pixel sample locations in the pixel, the determined anti-aliased value of the pixel will be<br>
0.25 even if half the pixel is covered by the edge. The pixel will hence be poorly<br>
presented.<br>
9<br><br><br>
	If the same situation occurs with the use of the scheme of FIGURES 3 A &amp; 3B<br>
with an edge of a polygon positioned in a near-to-horizontal line orientation that covers a<br>
small part of the top of the pixels 301, 302, the polygon edge will not cover both pixel<br>
sample locations, but only the sample location on the uppermost horizontal edge of the<br>
pixels 301, 302 due to the placement of the sample locations.<br>
	FIGURE 4 illustrates a pixel sampling pattern in which pixel sample points 403-<br>
406 of a pixel 401 are not placed in the corners of the pixel as is the case with the<br>
Quincunx scheme. A pixel sample configuration as illustrated by pixel sample points 403-<br>
406 is referred to as "quad A." Correspondingly, a pixel 402 representing a pixel sample<br>
configuration as illustrated by pixel sample points 406-409 is referred to as "quad B."<br>
	By examining the configurations of quad A and quad B side-by-side it is<br>
evident that the pixel sample points 406-409 of quad B mirror image are the corresponding<br>
pixel sample points 403-406 in quad A when reflected at a right vertical edge 410 of quad<br>
A (and consequently a left vertical edge of quad B). By mirroring the locations of the<br>
pixel sample points 403-406 and 406-409, it is possible to share the pixel sample point 406<br>
between the two pixels and still break up the symmetry of the pixel sampling<br>
configurations to achieve a better anti-aliasing result. There is only one sample per row<br>
and one sample per column. In, for example, the Quincunx scheme, there are two samples<br>
for the top row.<br>
	FIGURE 5 illustrates an anti-aliasing scheme in which an upper left pixel 501<br>
contains four pixel sample points 510-513 in a quad A configuration. A pixel 502 to the<br>
right of the pixel 501 also contains four pixel sample points 513-516 in a quad B<br>
configuration, which are reflected at the right edge of the leftmost pixel 501. Moreover, a<br>
third pixel 503 also contains four pixel sample points 516-519 in a quad A configuration.<br>
As can be seen from FIGURE 5, pixels 501-503 share one pixel sample point 513, 516<br>
between each pair of pixels 501-502, 502-503. A lower row of pixels including pixels<br>
504-506 starts with the pixel 504 presenting a quad B configuration of pixel sample points<br>
511, 520-522. The pixel sample point 511 is shared between the pixel 504 and the pixel<br>
501 on the row of pixels above. By examining the configurations of quad A (i.e., the<br>
10<br><br><br>
topmost pixel 501) and quad B (i.e., the lower pixel 504) side-by-side, it is evident that the<br>
pixel sample points 511, 520-522 of quad B form a mirror image of the corresponding<br>
points 510-513 in quad A reflected at a bottom horizontal edge 530 of the pixel 501 (and<br>
consequently a top horizontal edge of pixel 504).<br>
	The pixel 505 contains four pixel sample points 515, 522-524 in a quad A<br>
configuration. The pixel 505 shares one pixel sample point 515 with the pixel 502 and one<br>
pixel sample point 522 with the pixel 504. The same applies to the rightmost pixel 506,<br>
which also shares two pixel sample points 517, 524 with the neighboring pixels 503, 505.<br>
	By using a mirroring scheme, all pixels, except for the uppermost and leftmost<br>
pixels 501-504 on a display, require a calculation of only two new pixel sample location<br>
values when determining the final value of the pixels 501-506. In an example in which<br>
pixel calculations are performed in a left-to-right and top-to-bottom order, for pixel 501,<br>
values for pixel samples points 510-513 are calculated. For pixel 502, values pixel sample<br>
points 514-516 are calculated, while the value of pixel sample point 513 does not have to<br>
be calculated because it has already been calculated for pixel 501. For pixel 503, the<br>
values of pixel sample points 517-519 are calculated, while the value of pixel sample point<br>
516 does not have to be calculated because it has already been calculated for pixel 502.<br>
For pixel 504, values of pixel sample points 520-522 are calculated, while the value of<br>
pixel sample point 511 does not have to be calculated because it has already been<br>
calculated for pixel 501. For pixel 505, only the values of pixel sample points 523-524 are<br>
calculated, while the values of pixel sample points 515 and 522 do not have to be<br>
calculated because they have already been calculated for pixels 502 and 504, respectively.<br>
Similarly, for pixel 506, only the values of pixel sample points 525-526 are calculated,<br>
while the values of pixel sample points 517 and 524 do not have to be calculated because<br>
they have already been calculated for pixels 503 and 505, respectively. In another option<br>
in which the pixels may be traversed by scanning from right to left and bottom to top, all<br>
pixels except the rightmost column and the bottommost row require only two samples. In<br>
another option, the scanning direction may be altered every other line in order to render<br>
memory usage more effective. It should be understood that any number of ways<br>
understood to those of ordinary skill in the art to traverse the pixels of a geometric<br>
11<br><br><br>
primitive are possible as long as all pixels inside the geometric primitive are visited by the<br>
traversal scheme.<br>
	FIGURES 6A and 6B illustrate a super-sampling scheme in which pixel sample<br>
points 303'-306' are placed at the edges of a pixel 301', and pixel sample points 307'-310'<br>
are placed at the edges of a pixel 302'. This allows for pixel sample sharing between the<br>
pixel 301' and the pixel 302' in display memory if the pixel 301' and the pixel 302' are<br>
positioned adjacent to one another. In the super-sampling scheme of FIGURES 6A and<br>
6B, one or more of the pixel sample points 303'-306' may be located at a predetermined<br>
position within an interval along the edge of the pixels 301' and 302'. FIGURES 6A and<br>
6B illustrate a predetermined interval associated with each of the pixel sample points 303'-<br>
310', with each predetermined interval being represented by a bracket. Although each<br>
bracket is illustrated as extending along a portion of a pixel edge, it should be understood<br>
that the pixel sample points may be positioned along any portion of the pixel edge. In the<br>
embodiment of FIGURES 6 A and 6B, one pixel sample location is defined for each edge<br>
of the pixel 301, 302 and is given a weight of 0.25. Example equations for determining<br>
the precise pixel sample locations for FIGURE 6A as follows:<br>
	303'=(x0+2/3+offset(x0, y0, 0), y0+l)<br>
	304'=(x0, y0+2/3+offset(x0, y0, 1))<br>
	305?=(x0+l/3+offset(x0, y0, 2), y0)<br>
	306'=(x0+l, y0+l/3+offset(x0, y0, 3))<br>
	and for FIGURE 6B as follows:<br>
	307'=(x0+l/3+offset(x0 y0, 0), y0+l)<br>
	308'=(x0, y0.+l/3+offset(x0, y0, 1))<br>
	309'=(x.+2/3+offset(x0, y0, 2), y0)<br>
	310'=(x0+l, y0+2/3+offset(x0, y0, 3))<br>
	where the offset() function represents a function for generating a displacement<br>
value within a predetermined range, and the terms xO and yO represent an origin point of<br>
an x-axis ("x") and a y-axis ("y"), respectively as illustrated in FIGURES 6A and 6B. In<br>
another embodiment, it is not necessary to include the added constant in the equations for<br>
12<br><br><br>
determining pixel sample locations, as this information can already be encoded within the<br>
look-up table or in the pseudo-random function. For example, the equation for pixel<br>
sample location 303' may be of the form:<br>
	303'=(x0+offset(x0, y0, 0), y0+1)<br>
	The displaced (or offset) placement of one or more of the pixel sample points 303'-<br>
310' serves to break the periodicity of the sampling pattern in order to increase the anti-<br>
aliasing effect on straight edges, especially those near 27 degrees. For sampling patterns<br>
in with displacement of pixel sample points is not performed, edges at 27 degrees may<br>
otherwise produce undesirable results due to the fact that the pixel sample points represent<br>
a square that is rotated by 27 degrees. Introducing displacements in accordance with<br>
various embodiments of the present invention will break this symmetry, producing a better<br>
result.<br>
	In one option, each of the pixel sample points 303'-310' may be positioned at a<br>
predetermined offset as read from a look-up table such that the pixel sampling pattern is<br>
not repeated for at least every pixel. In another option, each of the pixel sample points<br>
303'-310' may be positioned using a pseudo-random number generator. In still another<br>
option, the sampling pattern may include one or more pixel sample points located inside<br>
the pixel in addition to those located at or near the edges of the pixel.<br>
	FIGURE 7 illustrates a pixel sampling pattern in which pixel sample points<br>
403'-406' of a leftmost pixel 401' are placed at predetermined positions along the edges of<br>
the pixel 401'. Pixel sample points 407'-409' are placed at the edges of a pixel 402'. The<br>
position of at least one of pixel sample points 403'-409' may be located at a predetermined<br>
position within a predetermined interval along the respective edges of the pixels 401' and<br>
402'. FIGURE 7 illustrates a predetermined interval associated with each of the pixel<br>
sample points 403'-409', with each predetermined interval being represented by a bracket.<br>
Although the bracket is illustrated as extending along a portion of a pixel edge, it should<br>
be understood that the pixel sample points may be positioned along any portion of the<br>
pixel edge.<br>
13<br><br><br>
	FIGURE 8 illustrates an anti-aliasing scheme in which an upper left pixel 501'<br>
contains four pixel sample points 510'-513' A pixel 502' to the right of the pixel 501' also<br>
contains four pixel sample points 513'-516'. Moreover, a third pixel 503' also contains<br>
four pixel sample points 516'-519' As can be seen from FIGURE 8, pixels 501'-503' share<br>
one pixel sample points 513', 516' between each pair of pixels 501'-502', 502'-503'. A<br>
lower row of pixels starts with a pixel 504' presenting a configuration of pixel sample<br>
points 511', 520'-522'. The pixel sample point 511' is shared between the pixel 504' and<br>
the pixel 501' on the row of pixels above.<br>
	The pixel 505' contains four pixel sample points 515', 522'-524'. The pixel 505'<br>
shares one pixel sample point 515' with the pixel 502' on the row above and one pixel<br>
sample point 522' with the pixel 504'. The same applies to the rightmost pixel 506', which<br>
also shares two pixel sample points 517', 524' with the neighboring pixels 503', 505'. The<br>
position of at least one of pixel sample point 510'-525' may be located at a predetermined<br>
position within a predetermined interval along the respective edges of at least one of the<br>
pixels 501'-506'. In one option, the pixel sample points are positioned at a predetermined<br>
offset read from a lookup table. In another option, the pixel sample points are pseudo-<br>
randomly positioned inside a predetermined interval of a pixel edge.<br>
	All pixels, except for the uppermost and leftmost pixels 501'-504', require a<br>
calculation of only two new pixel sample point values when determining the final value of<br>
the pixels 501'-506'. In another option, all pixels except the rightmost column and the<br>
bottommost row in an image require only two samples. The sample locations in the pixels<br>
of an image may be traversed by scanning the lines from left to right. In another option,<br>
the scanning direction may be altered every other line in order to render memory usage<br>
more effective. Additionally, it should be understood that any traversal scheme can be<br>
implemented in conjunction with the supersampling scheme.<br>
	FIGURE 9A is a flow chart illustrating a method for producing high-quality<br>
anti-aliased images in which one or more geometric primitives are sampled to produce an<br>
image. In an application stage (step 610), a processor (e.g, a Central Processing Unit<br>
14<br><br><br>
(CPU)) runs an application program (e.g., a computer game) and generates geometric<br>
primitives (for example, polygons in the form of triangles) that are to be converted into a<br>
2D presentation on a display.<br>
	Next, in a geometry stage (step 620), the processor or a Graphical Processing<br>
Unit (GPU) calculates the different visual effects that affect the appearance of the object<br>
on the display, such as lighting, clipping, transformations, or projections. As geometric<br>
primitives are typically used when creating 3-D objects in computer graphics, the pixel<br>
coordinates of the vertices of the geometric primitive are typically calculated.<br>
	In a rasterizer stage (step 630), triangles are drawn to a sample buffer.<br>
Perspective-correct interpolation of texture coordinates over the one or more geometric<br>
primitives is used in order to ensure that a correct projection is obtained. The rasterizer<br>
stage may be performed by the processor and/or a GPU. In addition to this, the processor<br>
or GPU may also, for example, interpolate one or more colors, another set of texture<br>
coordinates, or fog, etc. The processor or GPU may also perform Z-buffer tests, and<br>
ensure that a final pixel obtains the correct color. In a filtering stage (step 640), the<br>
sample buffer is filtered to produce pixel colors that are stored in a color buffer. The<br>
contents of the color buffer can then be displayed on the screen.<br>
	FIGURE 9B is a more detailed flow chart illustrating step 630 of FIGURE 9A.<br>
In step 631, geometric primitive setup for a first geometric primitive is performed in which<br>
a first sample point of a pixel sample pattern in accordance with various embodiments of<br>
the present invention is found in the geometric primitive and the process proceeds to step<br>
632. In step 632 it is determined if the sample point has been found within the boundaries<br>
of the geometric primitive. If no sample point has been found within the geometric<br>
primitive, the process continues to step 633 in which it is determined whether there exists<br>
more geometric primitives to be drawn. If more geometric primitives exist to be drawn,<br>
the process proceeds to step 634. In step 634, the next geometric primitive is retrieved and<br>
the process returns to step 631 in which geometric primitive setup is performed. If in step<br>
633 it is determined that no more geometric primitives exits to be drawn, step 630 ends<br>
15<br><br><br>
and the process proceeds to step 640 in which filtering of samples is performed to produce<br>
filters.<br>
	If in step 632 it is determined that the sample point is found within the<br>
geometric primitive, the process proceeds to step 635 in which a visibility check is<br>
performed regarding whether the sample will be visible in the geometric primitive. In step<br>
636 a determination is made regarding whether the sample is visible. If the sample is not<br>
visible, the process proceeds to step 637 in which the geometric primitive is traversed to<br>
find the next sample point within the geometric primitive, and the process continues to<br>
step 632.<br>
	If in step 636 a determination is made that the sample point is visible,<br>
computation of a color of the sample is performed in step 638, and in step 639 the color<br>
and depth of the sample is stored in one or more buffers, such as a sample buffer. The<br>
process then returns to step 637 in which the geometric primitive is traversed to find the<br>
next sample point within the geometric primitive.<br>
	FIGURES 10A-10D illustrate a variant of a multisampling scheme comprising<br>
three pixel sample points for each of pixels 801, 802, 811,812. Pixel sample points 803-<br>
808, 813-818 are placed at borders of the pixel 801, 802, 811, 812. The borders of the<br>
pixels function as mirror planes for sample sharing, which allows for sharing of samples<br>
between the different pixels 801, 802, 811, 812 in a display memory.<br>
	At least one of the pixel sample points 803-808, 813-818 is placed at a corner of<br>
each pixel 801, 802, 811,812. The term "at a corner" means that the sample is provided<br>
approximately at the corner of two intersection borders of the pixel, for example, at a<br>
distance from the corner of no greater than one-third of the length of a shortest pixel edge<br>
terminating at the corner. However, the corner sample may be slightly displaced with<br>
regard to the actual corner, as long as the corner sample may be used for the calculation of<br>
up to four pixel values.<br>
16<br><br><br>
	In the multisampling scheme of FIGURES 10A-10D, a first pixel sample point<br>
is defined for a corner of two borders of the pixels 801, 802, 811,812. Second and third<br>
pixel sample points are defined for separate borders of the pixels 801, 802, 811,812,<br>
which do not intersect the pixel corner where the first pixel sample resides. In FIGURES<br>
10A-10D, the second and third pixel sample of each pixel 801, 802, 811, and 812 is<br>
positioned at the center of the border between two corners. For pixel 801, pixel sample<br>
points 804, 805 are each positioned in the center of the center of a border between two<br>
corners. For pixel 802, pixel sample points 806, 807 are each positioned in the center of<br>
the center of a border between two corners. For pixel 811, pixel sample points 813,815<br>
are each positioned in the center of the center of a border between two corners. For pixel<br>
812, pixel sample points 816, 817 are each positioned in the center of the center of a<br>
border between two corners. Pixel sample points 803, 808, 814, and 818 are each<br>
positioned at a corner of pixels 801, 802, 811, and 812, respectively. However, the second<br>
and third pixel sample point may be positioned at any point on the border as long as the<br>
sample may be used for the calculation of the values of two neighboring pixels. Also, in<br>
FIGURES 10A-10D, the second and third pixel sample points 804, 805, 806, 807, 813,<br>
815, 816, 817 are positioned on the borders of their respective pixels 801, 802, 811, 812 at<br>
the same distance from a corner. In another option, the distance from a corner may be<br>
different for each of pixel sample points 804, 805, 806, 807, 813, 815, 816, 817. Each of<br>
the pixel sample points is given a weight of 1/3 (i.e., so that the sum of the weights equals<br>
1). Another weight distribution that may be used is 0.2 for the first pixel sample and 0.4<br>
for each of the second and third pixel sample. Any other weight distribution for the pixel<br>
samples may be used as long as their sum totals a value of one.<br>
	In FIGURES 10A-10D, a grid is superimposed over each of the pixels 801, 802,<br>
811,812 and defines a possible pixel sample point at a corner and wherever the grid<br>
intersects a border not intersecting the corner of pixels 801, 802, 811,812 where the<br>
corner pixel sample point resides. Exemplary equations for determining the precise<br>
sample point pattern of each pixel 801, 802, 811, 812 are shown in FIGURES 10A-10D,<br>
respectively. In the equations of FIGURES 10A-10D, the terms xO and yO represent an<br>
origin point of an x-axis ("x") and a y-axis ("y"), respectively as illustrated in FIGURES<br>
10A-10D.<br>
17<br><br><br>
	FIGURE 11 illustrates a multisampling scheme in which a leftmost pixel 901<br>
includes one pixel sample point 903 at a comer and two pixel sample points 904-905 on<br>
separate borders of the pixel 901. In the following text, this pixel sample configuration<br>
will be referred to as Pattern A. Correspondingly, a second pixel 902 presenting a pixel<br>
sample configuration having pixel sample points 905-907 is referred to as Pattern B. By<br>
examining the configurations of Pattern A and Pattern B side-by-side, it is evident that the<br>
pixel sample points 905-907 of Pattern B are a mirror image of the corresponding points<br>
903-905 in Pattern A. Pattern A is reflected at the right vertical border 908 of the pixel<br>
901	to form Pattern B of the pixel 902. Thus, the Pattern B is a mirror image of the<br>
Pattern A.<br>
	The pixel sample points of the Pattern A and the Pattern B may also be mirrored<br>
in their respective bottom horizontal border 909. A third pixel 911 presenting a pixel<br>
sample configuration that is a mirror image of Pattern A when mirrored in the bottom<br>
horizontal border of pixel 901 will be referred to as Pattern C. The Pattern C has pixel<br>
sample points 904, 923-924, wherein one of the pixel sample points (i.e., the pixel sample<br>
point 904 is shared with Pattern A. A fourth pixel 912 presenting a pixel sample<br>
configuration that is a mirror image of Pattern B when mirrored in the bottom horizontal<br>
border 909 will be referred to as Pattern D. The Pattern D has pixel sample points 906,<br>
924-925, wherein one of the pixel sample points (i.e., pixel sample point 906) is shared<br>
with Pattern B, and one pixel sample point (i.e., pixel sample point 924) is shared with<br>
Pattern C.<br>
	By mirroring the locations of the pixel sample points 903-905 across the vertical<br>
border 908 it is possible to share the pixel sample point 905 between the two pixels 901,<br>
902	and still break up the symmetry of the configuration and achieve an improved anti-<br>
aliasing result. In the multisampling scheme of FIGURE 11 there is only one sample per<br>
pixel row and pixel column. In contrast, with the Quincunx scheme, there are two samples<br>
for a top row.<br>
18<br><br><br>
	FIGURE 12 illustrates an anti-aliasing scheme in a 3x3 pixel configuration<br>
including nine pixels 1001-1009. The upper leftmost pixel 1001 contains three pixel<br>
sample points 1010-1012 in a Pattern A configuration. The second pixel 1002 includes<br>
three pixel sample points 1012-1014 in a Pattern B configuration, which are mirrored at<br>
the right border of the upper leftmost pixel 1001. Moreover, the pixel 1003 includes three<br>
pixel sample points 1014-1016 in a Pattern A configuration. As can be seen from<br>
FIGURE 12, the upper row of pixels 1001-1003 share one pixel sample point 1012,1014<br>
between each pair of pixels 1001-1002,1002-1003.<br>
		A second pixel row starts with the pixel 1004 presenting a Pattern C<br>
configuration of pixel sample points 1011, 1017-1018. The pixel sample point 1011 is<br>
shared between the pixel 1004 and the pixel 1001. The pixel 1005, on the second row,<br>
includes three pixel sample points 1013, 1018-1019 in a Pattern D configuration. The<br>
pixel 1005 shares one pixel sample point 1013 with the pixel 1002 and one pixel sample<br>
point 1018 with the pixel 1004. The same applies to the pixel 1006, on the second row,<br>
having three pixel sample points 1015,1019-1020, which also shares two pixel sample<br>
points 1015,1019 with the neighboring pixels 1003,1005.<br>
	A third pixel row starts with the pixel 1007 presenting a Pattern A configuration<br>
of pixel sample points 1017,1021-1022. The pixel sample point 1017 is shared between<br>
the pixel 1007 and the fourth 1004. The pixel 1008 includes three pixel sample points<br>
1019, 1022-1023 in a Pattern B configuration. The pixel 1008 shares one pixel sample<br>
point 1019 with the pixel 1005 and one pixel sample point 1022 with the pixel 1007 to the<br>
left. The same applies to the pixel 1009, on the third row, and having three pixel sample<br>
points 1019,1024-1025, which shares one pixel sample point 1019 with the neighboring<br>
pixel 1006.<br>
	By examining FIGURE 12, it is evident that all pixel sample points provided at<br>
a pixel corner, except in the topmost row and the leftmost column, are shared between four<br>
pixels. Thus, the majority (for a relatively large grid of pixels) of the corner pixel samples<br>
only need to be calculated once for four pixels, wherein the calculation cost is 0.25 per<br>
pixel. The pixel sample points 1011,1012,1013,1015,1018,1021,1022,1023,1024<br>
19<br><br><br>
provided on the border not intersecting the borders of the corner pixel, which are shared<br>
between two pixels, will only have to be calculated once for two neighboring pixels.<br>
Thus, the calculation cost for these border pixels is 0.5 per pixel.<br>
	Consequently, by using a mirroring scheme, all pixels, except for the uppermost<br>
and leftmost pixels 1001-1004,1007, require on average a calculation of only 1.25<br>
(0.25+0.5+0.5=1.25) new pixel sample point values for determining a final value of the<br>
pixels 1001-1009. In another option, all pixels except those in the rightmost column and<br>
those in the bottommost row require only 1.25 samples. In most known multisampling<br>
configurations, at least two pixel samples must be calculated in order to determine the<br>
final value of a pixel.<br>
	The sample locations in the pixels may be traversed by scanning the lines from<br>
left to right. In another option, the scanning direction may be altered every other line in<br>
order to render memory usage more effective. It is understood that any traversal scheme<br>
can be implemented in conjunction with the multisampling scheme.<br>
	FIGURES 13A-13D illustrate a multisampling scheme. The multisampling<br>
scheme of FIGURES 13A-13D is illustrated as including three pixel samples for each<br>
pixel 801', 802', 811', 812'. The pixel sample points 803'-808', 813'-818' are placed at the<br>
borders of the pixels 801', 802', 811', 812'. The pixel sample points 801', 808', 814' and<br>
818' are each placed at a corner of pixels 801', 802', 811', 812', respectively. In accordance<br>
with the multisampling scheme of FIGURES 13A-13D, one or more of the pixel sample<br>
points 804', 805' 806', 807', 813', 815', 816' and 817' is located at a predetermined position<br>
within an interval along an edge of pixels 801', 802', 811', 812'. FIGURES 13A-13D<br>
illustrate a predetermined interval associated with each of the pixel sample points 804',<br>
805', 806', 807', 813', 815', 816', 817', with each predetermined interval being represented<br>
by a bracket. The term "at a corner" means that the sample is provided approximately at<br>
the corner of two intersection borders of a pixel. However, the corner sample may be<br>
displaced with regard to the actual corner, as long as the corner sample may be used for<br>
the calculation of up to four pixel values. For example, the sample point may be also be<br>
located near a corner such the sample point is located at a distance of less than or equal to<br>
20<br><br><br>
one-third of a pixel width. In still another option, a sampling pattern may include one or<br>
more pixel sample points located inside the pixel in addition to those located at or near the<br>
edges or corner of the pixel.<br>
	In the multisampling scheme of FIGURES 13A-13D, first pixel sample points<br>
803', 808', 814', 818' are defined for a corner of two borders of the pixels 801', 802', 811',<br>
812', respectively. Second and third pixel sample points 804', 805', 806', 807', 813', 815'<br>
816', 817' are defined for separate borders of the pixels 801', 802", 811', 812', that do not<br>
intersect the corner pixel sample. In FIGURES 13A-13D, the second and third pixel<br>
sample points 804', 805', 806', 807', 813', 815' 816', 817' of each pixel 801', 802", 811',<br>
812' are positioned at the center of the border between two corners. However, as<br>
previously described, the second and third pixel samples 804', 805', 806', 807', 813', 815'<br>
816', 817' may be located at any position on the border as long as the sample may be used<br>
for the calculation of the values of two neighboring pixels. Each of the pixel samples may<br>
be given a weight of 1/3 (i.e., the sum of the weights equals 1). Thus, another exemplary<br>
weight distribution is 0.2 for the first pixel sample and 0.4 for each of the second and third<br>
pixel samples.<br>
	Example equations for determining a precise pixel sample point pattern of each<br>
pixel of FIGURE 13A are as follows:<br>
	803'=(x0, y0+l)<br>
	804'=(x0+0.5+offset(x0, y0, 0), y0)<br>
	805'=(x0+l, y0+0.5+offset(x0, y0, 1))<br>
	for FIGURE 13B as follows:<br>
	806'=(x0, y0+0.5+offset(x0, y0, 0))<br>
	807'=(x0+0.5+offset(x0, y0, 1), y0)<br>
	808'=(x0+l,y0+l)<br>
	for FIGURE 13C as follows:<br>
	813'=(x0+0.5+offset(x0, y0, 0), y0+l)<br>
	814'-(x0,y0)<br>
	815'=(x0+l, y0+0.5+offset(x0, y0, 1))<br>
21<br><br><br>
	and for FIGURE 13D as follows:<br>
	816'=(x0, y0+0.5+offset(x0, y0, 0)<br>
	817'=(x0+0.5+offset(x0, y0, 1), y0 1)<br>
	818'=(x0+l,y0)<br>
where the offset() function represents a function for generating a displacement value<br>
within a predetermined range, and the x0 and y0 terms represent an origin point of an x-<br>
axis ("x") and a y-axis ("y"), respectively as illustrated in FIGURES 13A-13D. In another<br>
embodiment, it is not necessary to include the added 0.5 constant in the equations for<br>
determining pixel sample locations, as this information can already be encoded within the<br>
look-up table or in the pseudo-random function. For example, the equation for pixel<br>
sample location 804' may be of the form:<br>
	804'=(x0+offset(x0, y0, 0), y0)<br>
	The displaced (offset) placement of the pixel sample points 803'-808', 813'-818'<br>
serves to break the symmetry of the configuration and increases the anti-aliasing effect. In<br>
one option, each of the pixel sample points 804'-807, 813', and 815'-817' may be<br>
positioned at a predetermined offset as read from a look-up table such that the pixel<br>
sampling pattern is not repeated for at least every pixel. In another option, each of the<br>
pixel sample points 804'-807', 813', and 815'-817' may be positioned using a pseudo-<br>
random number generator.<br>
	FIGURE 14 illustrates a multisampling scheme in which a leftmost pixel 901'<br>
includes one pixel sample point 903' at a corner and two pixel sample points 904'-905' at<br>
predetermined positions located within intervals along the borders of the pixel 901'. A<br>
second pixel 902' has a pixel sample point 907' at a corner and two pixel sample points<br>
905' and 906' located at predetermined positions within intervals along borders of the pixel<br>
902'. A third pixel 911' has a pixel sample point 923' at a corner and two pixel sample<br>
points 904' and 924' located at predetermined positions within intervals along borders of<br>
the pixel 911'. A fourth pixel 912' has a pixel sample point '925 at a corner and two pixel<br>
sample points 906' and 924' located at predetermined positions within intervals along the<br>
22<br><br><br>
borders of the pixel 912'. FIGURE 14 illustrates a predetermined interval associated with<br>
each of the pixel sample points 904', 905', 906', 924', with each predetermined interval<br>
being represented by a bracket. Although each bracket is illustrated as extending along a<br>
portion of a pixel edge, it should be understood that the pixel sample points may be<br>
positioned along any portion of the pixel edge. As illustrated in FIGURE 14, pixel sample<br>
points 904', 923'-924' form a pixel sample pattern wherein pixel sample point 904' is<br>
shared between pixel 901' and pixel 911'. Pixel sample points 906', 924'-925' form a pixel<br>
sample pattern wherein pixel sample point 906' is shared between pixel 902' and pixel<br>
912', and pixel sample point 924' is shared between pixel 911' and pixel 912'. The<br>
predetermined position of each pixel sample point may be determined, for example, by<br>
reference to a look-up table or pseudo-randomly.<br>
	The displaced or offset positioning of select pixel sample locations serves to<br>
break up the symmetry of the pixel sampling configuration and achieve a better anti-<br>
aliasing result. Further, there is only one sample per pixel row and one sample per pixel<br>
column. In, for example, Quincunx, there are two pixel samples for the top row of a pixel.<br>
	FIGURE 15 illustrates an anti-aliasing scheme in a 3x3 pixel configuration<br>
including nine pixels 1001'-1009'. The pixel 1001' contains three pixel sample points<br>
1010'-1012'. The pixel 1002', located to the right of the pixel 1001' includes three pixel<br>
sample points 1012'-1014'. Moreover, a pixel 1003' includes three pixel sample points<br>
1014'-1016'. As can be seen from FIGURE 15, the upper row of pixels 1001'-1003' shares<br>
one pixel sample point 1012', 1014' between each pair of pixels 1001'-1002', 1002'-1003'.<br>
	A second pixel row starts with a pixel 1004' presenting a configuration of pixel<br>
sample points 1011', 1017-1018'. The pixel sample point 1011' is shared between the<br>
pixel 1004' and the pixel 1001'. The pixel 1005', on the second row, includes three pixel<br>
sample points 1013', 1018'-1019'. The pixel 1005' shares one pixel sample point 1013'<br>
with the pixel 1002' and one pixel sample point 1018' with the pixel 1004'. The same<br>
applies to the pixel 1006', located on the second row and having three pixel sample points<br>
1015', 1019'-1020', which also shares two pixel sample points 1015', 1019' with the<br>
neighboring pixels 1003', 1005'.<br>
23<br><br><br>
	The third pixel row starts with the pixel 1007' presenting a configuration of<br>
pixel sample points 1017', 1021'-1022'. The pixel sample point 1017' is shared between<br>
the pixel 1007' and the pixel 1004'. The pixel 1008' includes three pixel sample points<br>
1019', 1022'-1023'. The pixel 1008' shares one pixel sample point 1019' with the pixel<br>
1005' and one pixel sample point 1022' with the pixel 1007'. The same applies to the pixel<br>
1009', having three pixel sample points 1019', 1024'-1025', which shares one pixel sample<br>
point 1019' with the neighboring pixel 1006'. One or more of pixel samples 1011', 1012',<br>
1013', 1015', 1016', 1018', 1020', 1021', 1022', 1023', 1024', and 1025' may be located at<br>
predetermined positions within intervals along the borders of the pixels 1001'-1009'.<br>
FIGURE 15 illustrates a predetermined interval associated with each of the pixel sample<br>
points 1011', 1012', 1013', 1015', 1016', 1018', 1020', 1021', 1022', 1023', 1024', and 1025',<br>
with each predetermined interval being represented by a bracket. Although each bracket is<br>
illustrated as extending along a portion of a pixel edge, it should be understood that the<br>
pixel sample points may be positioned along any portion of the pixel edge. The<br>
predetermined position of each pixel sample point may be determined, for example,<br>
pseudo-randomly or by reference to a look-up table.<br>
	By examining FIGURE 15, it is evident that all pixel sample points provided at<br>
a pixel corner, except in the topmost row and the leftmost column, are shared between four<br>
pixels. Thus, the majority (for a relatively large grid of pixels) of the corner pixel samples<br>
only need to be calculated once for four pixels, wherein the calculation cost is 0.25 per<br>
pixel. The pixel sample points 1011', 1012', 1013', 1015', 1016', 1018', 1020', 1021',<br>
1022', 1023', 1024', and 1025' provided on the border not intersecting the borders of the<br>
corner pixel, which are shared between two pixels, will only have to be calculated once for<br>
two neighboring pixels. Thus, the calculation cost for these border pixels is 0.5 per pixel.<br>
	Consequently, all pixels, except for the uppermost and leftmost pixels 1001'-<br>
1004', 1007', require on average a calculation of only 1.25 (0.25+0.5+0.5=1.25) new pixel<br>
sample point values for determining the final value of the pixels 1001'-1009'. In another<br>
option, all pixels except the rightmost column and the bottommost row of pixels of an<br>
24<br><br><br>
image require only 1.25 samples. In most known multi-sampling configurations, at least<br>
two pixel samples must be calculated in order to determine the final value of a pixel.<br>
	The pixel sample points in the pixels may be traversed by scanning the lines<br>
from left to right. In another option, the scanning direction may be altered every other line<br>
in order to render the memory usage more effective. It is to be understood that any<br>
traversal scheme can be implemented without departing from the principles of the<br>
invention.<br>
	By using the multisampling scheme of FIGURE 15, it is only necessary to<br>
access a display memory a maximum three times to calculate the final value of a pixel.<br>
However, by providing an additional small and fast memory, such as an on-chip cache<br>
memory, for temporarily storing samples needed in one or several subsequent<br>
computations of pixel values, it is possible to decrease the necessary access to the display<br>
memory to a minimum of 1.25. By using this approach with the Quincunx scheme, it is<br>
necessary to access a memory a minimum of two times for the calculation of the final<br>
value of a pixel. Moreover, an even smaller additional memory may be utilized to store<br>
only one sample( i.e., the sample that is used for calculating the value of a first pixel and<br>
the calculation of a value of a subsequent pixel).<br>
	Referring again to FIGURE 14, the final value of the pixel 901' may be<br>
calculated by retrieving pixel samples 903'-905' from the display memory. The pixel<br>
sample 905' may then be temporarily stored in the additional memory. For the<br>
computation of the final value of the pixel 902', it is only necessary to retrieve the pixel<br>
samples 906'-907' from the display memory, whereas the pixel sample 905' may be<br>
retrieved from the additional memory. Consequently, it is only necessary to access the<br>
display memory twice for the calculation of the majority of pixels of a large grid of pixels,<br>
such as, for example, a 176x174 pixel grid of a mobile terminal. Using the Quincunx<br>
scheme, it is necessary to access a display memory three times and an additional memory<br>
twice for the calculation of the final value of a pixel.<br>

	FIGURE 16 is a block diagram of a system for drawing one or more geometric<br>
primitives, such as a polygon, in accordance with a supersampling scheme having a pixel<br>
sample pattern. A Central Processing Unit (CPU) 701 is connected to a memory 702 via a<br>
data bus 703. The memory 702 includes an application program that may be run on the<br>
system( e.g., a computer game or a Computer Aided Design (CAD) program). The CPU<br>
701 fetches instructions in the memory 702 and executes the instructions in order to<br>
perform specific tasks. In this context, a task for the CPU 701 is to provide a Graphics<br>
Processing Unit (GPU) 704 with information regarding objects to draw on a display 705.<br>
	The GPU 704 may be in form of a processor, such as, for example, a Digital<br>
Signal Processor (DSP), or in the form of an Application Specific Integrated Circuit<br>
(ASIC), a Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA), hard-wired logic, or the like. In<br>
another option, it may be executed on the CPU 701. The GPU 704 is also connected to the<br>
bus 703 but may as well be connected to the CPU 701 via a separate high-speed bus 706 in<br>
case a large amount of information is to be transferred between the CPU 701 and the GPU<br>
704.	The data transfers on the separate high-speed bus 706 will then not interfere with the<br>
data traffic on the ordinary bus 703.<br>
	A display memory 707 is also connected to the bus 703 and stores information<br>
sent from the GPU 704 regarding pictures (i.e., frames) that are to be drawn on the display<br>
705.	More specifically, the display memory contains a sample buffer 707a and a color<br>
buffer 707b. The sample buffer 707a contains approximately twice as many samples as<br>
there are pixels in the final color buffer 707b. The color buffer 707b holds the colors of<br>
the pixels to be displayed on screen after the rendering of an image is complete. As with<br>
the interconnection between the CPU 701 and the GPU 704, the display memory 707 may<br>
be connected directly to the GPU 704 via a separate, high-speed bus. Since the GPU 704<br>
and the display memory 707 are typically used for producing moving images, the link<br>
between these two units is typically desired to be as fast as possible and not block the<br>
normal traffic on the bus 703.<br>
	The display memory 707 is connected to a Video Digital to Analog Converter<br>
(VDAC) 708, either via the shared bus 703 or by a separate high-speed bus 709, which<br>
26<br><br><br>
reads the information from the color buffer 707b and converts it to an analog signal (e.g. a<br>
Red, Green, Blue (RGB) composite signal) that is provided to the display 705 in order to<br>
draw individual pixels on the display 705. The GPU 704 performs a supersampling or<br>
multisampling procedure using a pixel sampling pattern as described herein to produce the<br>
pixels held in the color buffer 707b.<br>
	Although the previous Detailed Description describes example embodiments in<br>
which the positioning of pixel sample points may be determined using a table look-up or<br>
pseudo-random method, it should be understood that other methods of positioning pixel<br>
sample points may be used in accordance with the principles of the invention.<br>
	The previous Detailed Description is of embodiment(s) of the invention. The<br>
scope of the invention should not necessarily be limited by this Description. For example,<br>
it should be understood that the present invention can be used with any sample scheme<br>
that places samples on the edges of pixels. It should also be understood that the<br>
supersampling scheme of the various described embodiments of the present invention may<br>
be included in a number of devices including a computer and a mobile terminal. The<br>
