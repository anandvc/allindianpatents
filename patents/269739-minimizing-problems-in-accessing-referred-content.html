DESCRIPTION<br>
[Para l]Background of the Invention [Para 2] Field of the Invention<br>
[Para 3] The present invention relates to content management in digital processing systems, and more specifically to a method and apparatus for minimizing problems in accessing referred content.<br>
[Para 4] Related Art<br>
[Para 5] There are often scenarios in which content ("referred content") from one source is referred to in the content of another source. For example, when a user accesses a web page, the web page may be defined to contain content of several files, and the web page delivered to the user contains the contents of all such files. The files thus accessed (and containing the referred content) are termed to as referred documents and the web page is termed as the referrer document.<br>
[Para 6] While the referred content in the above example is provided as integral to the referrer document (for example, due to the definition of the web page), there are other scenarios in which the referred content is delivered external to the referrer document. As an illustration, many web pages often contain hyperlinks with an associated Uniform Resource Locator (URL), and a user selects the hyperlink to access the content of the (referred) document corresponding to the URL.<br>
[Para 7] Users are known to experience problems in accessing referred content, typically because of changes to the document identifier of the referred documents or deletion of the referred documents themselves. A document identifier refers to a name/string (often including directory structure where the document is located), which is used to uniquely identify the document interfacing with the system software (e.g., operating system) executing on a system from which the document is accessible.<br>
[Para 8] In such situations, user accessing content are displayed messages such as 'file not found' or a portion of the display containing blank. It is generally desirable that such access problems be avoided.<br>
[Para 9]Brief Description of the Drawings<br>
[Para 10] The present invention will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings briefly described below.<br>
[Para 11] Figure (Fig.)l is a block diagram of an example environment in which various aspects of the present invention can be implemented. [Para 12] Figure 2 is a flow-chart illustrating the manner in which problems in accessing referred documents can be minimized according to an aspect of the present invention.<br>
[Para 13] Figure 3 contains a table illustrating an example data structure used for maintaining a list of referring documents associated with each referred document according to an aspect of the present invention. [Para 14] Figure 4A is a flow-chart illustrating the manner in which a web server and a content server together may minimize errors while accessing contents corresponding to referred documents.<br>
[Para 15] Figure 4B is a flow-chart illustrating the manna- in which a web server and a content server together process a request for providing contents of a referred document according to an aspect of the present invention. [Para 16] Figures 5A depicts a data structure used for maintaining mapping of a Universal Resource Locator (URL) to a corresponding virtual link in an embodiment of the present invention.<br>

[Para 20] In the drawings, like reference numbers generally indicate identical, functionally similar, and/or structurally similar elements. The drawing in which an element first appears is indicated by the leftmost digit(s) in the corresponding reference number.<br>
[Para 21]Detailed Description of The Preferred Embodiments [Para 22] 1. Overview<br>
[Para 23] According to an aspect of the present invention, data indicating the referrer documents corresponding to each referred document is maintained. Thus, when there is a change of the document identifier (either moved to a new location, deleted or renamed) of a referred document, the corresponding referrer documents which may require changes are easily identified. In one embodiment described below, the administrator corresponding to each of such identified referrer documents is notified of the change to the document identifier of the referred document<br>
[Para24] According to another aspect of the present invention, a server ("web server"), processing requests for web pages identified by corresponding Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), maintains a map of the URL to a logical link. A content server providing the document corresponding to the URL maintains a mapping from die logical link to the document identifier.<br>
[Para 25] Thus, when a web server receives a request for a web page identified by a URL, the web server maps the URL to a corresponding logical link and sends the logical link to a content server. The content server maps the logical link to the corresponding document identifier and causes the corresponding content to be provided to the user system requesting the web page.<br>
[Para 26] If the document identifier of the referred document changes, the content server updates the map mapping the logical link to the corresponding document identifier. Thereafter, the content corresponding to the URL received by a web server continues to be provided to user systems sending the URL.<br>
[Para 27] Several aspects of the invention are described below with reference to examples for illustration. It should be understood that numerous specific details, relationships, and methods are set forth to provide a full understanding of the invention. One skilled in the relevant art, however, will readily recognize that the invention can be practiced without one or more of the specific details, or with other methods, etc. In other instances, well-known structures or operations are not shown in detail to avoid obscuring the features of the present invention.<br>
(Para 28] 2. Example Environment<br>
[Para 29] Figure 1 is a block diagram illustrating an example environment in which various aspects of the present invention can be implemented. The environment is shown containing client system 110, Internet 120, web server 150, intranet 170, and content server 160. Each system is described below in further detail.<br>
[Para 30] Internet 120 generally refers to a conglomeration of network connecting various systems (here, client system 110 and web server 150), and is implemented using protocols such as Internet Protocol (IP). Intranet 170 is also implemented using protocols such as IP, and is generally owned or operated by an organization providing the content/services. Intranet 170 provides connectivity between web server 150 and content server 160.<br>
[Para 31] Content server 160 may store (or otherwise provide access to) content of various web pages. Client system 11 OA may execute software such as browsers enabling a user to specify specific web pages of interest The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) corresponding to the specified web pages are forwarded to web server 150 via Internet 120.<br>
[Para 32] Web server 150 receives the URLs and any associated parameters, and causes the content corresponding to the URL to be served to client system 110. If the content is present on content server 160, web server 150 interfaces with content server 160 to serve the content Often times web server 150 itself stores the content Various aspects of the present invention minimize problems while providing access to the content as described below.<br>
[Para 33] 3. Method<br>
[Para 34] Figure 2 is a flow-chart illustrating the manner in which a server system (e.g., content server 160) minimizes problems in accessing referred content according to an aspect of the present invention. The flow chart is described with reference to Figure 1 merely for illustration. However, the features can be implemented in other environments as well. The flow chart begins in step 201, in which control immediately passes to step 210.<br>
[Para 35] In step 210, content server 160 maintain information indicating the list of referrer documents which refer to each referred document. Figure 3 illustrates an example table containing such information. Column 311 and 312 respectively contain the document identifiers of the referred and referrer documents. As depicted there in rows 321 and 322, a document with name docl (and contained in a directory /a/b/c) is referred by documents doc2 and doc3 (in directory /a/b/c). Column 330 indicates whether the referred document identifier is valid (i.e., not delete from content server 160).<br>
[Para 36] Continuing with reference to Figure 2, in step 220, content server 160 detects a change in the referred document identifier, for example, when the referred document is moved to a different location or deleted. Such changes are often implemented in the 'drivers' or other components of the system software, and the detection task may be implemented associated with the drivers/system software. Such implementations will be apparent to one skilled in the relevant arts by reading the disclosure provided herein.<br>
[Para 37] In step 240, content server 160 updates the information to reflect the change. For example, if the referred document is deleted, the corresponding row in valid column 330 is set to N (not valid) as depicted in row 323. On the other hand if the referred document is moved, the corresponding row in referred column 311 is modified to reflect the new document identifier (after the move).<br>
[Para 38] In step 270, content server 160 notifies (e.g., by email) the modification to the administrator of each referrer document associated with the referred document. The administrator can then take appropriate action, such as changing the document identifier in the corresponding referrer documents. The flowchart ends in step 299.<br>
[Para 39] Due to the notification to administrator, the problems in accessing content may be reduced since the administrator can take appropriate actions. One problem with the approach of above is that the administrator intervention is relied upon for corrections needed for continued access to the referred content The below noted approach overcomes some of such problems as described below.<br>
[Para 40] 4. Alternative Approach<br>
[Para 41] Figure 4A is a flowchart illustrating the manner in which problems in accessing content may be minimized according another aspect of the present invention. The flow chart is described with reference to Figure 1 merely for illustration. However, the features can be implemented in other environments as well. The flow chart begins in step 401, in which control immediately passes to step 410.<br>
[Para 42] In step 410, a first map mapping each resource locator to a virtual link, and a second map mapping the virtual link to the document identifier of the document is maintained. Web server 150 may maintain the first map and content server 160 may maintain the second map, as respectively shown with respect to Figures 5A and 5B. These tables can be contained within a database.<br>
[Para 43] As shown, columns 510 and 511 in Figure 5 A respectively contain URL and the virtual link (identifier), and columns 560 and 561 in Figure 5B respectively contain the virtual link to the document identifier. Thus, a URL of http://www.mywebsite.com/dl is shown mapped to linkl by row 521 of Figure 5A, and row 571 of Figure 5B is shown mapping linkl to /a/b/c/docl. The other mappings are similarly described. It should be appreciated that the two maps can be combined into a single map. In addition, web server 150 and content server 160 can be integrated as a single physical unit.<br>
[Para 44] Continuing with combined reference to Figures 4,5A, 5B and 5C, in step 420, content server 160 detects a change in the document identifier of the referred document. The detection can be performed similar to in step 220 described above. In step 430, content server 160 updates the second mapping to reflect the changes. Assuming docl has been moved to anew directory a/b/d and with a new name ndocl, Figure 5C depicts the corresponding second map. In particular, row 571 is shown changed to indicate the changed document identifier. The flowchart ends in step 449.<br>
[Para 45] Due to the updating of the second map (from the logical link to the document identifier), user accesses can continue without substantial disruption even when the document identifier changes, as further described below with reference to Figure 4B.<br>
[Para 46] Figure 4B is a flowchart illustrating the manner in which content of web pages is accessed consistent with the approach of Figure 4A, in an embodiment of the present invention. The flow chart begins instep 451, in which control immediately passes to step 460.<br>
[Para 47] In step 460, web server 150 receives a resource locator (URL) from client system 110. The URL may be received when a user at the client system selects a hyperlink encoding the URL in a referring document. The manner in which the web page (content of the referred document) corresponding to the URL is retrieved is described below.<br>
[Para 48] In step 465, web server 150 determines the virtual link corresponding to the resource locator according to the mapping of Figure 5A. In step 475, web server 150 sends the virtual link to content server 160. The interface between web server 150 and content server 160 can be implemented using any compatible approach, as will be apparent to one skilled in the relevant arts.<br>
[Para 49] In step 480, content server 160 maps the virtual link to the document identifier using the mapping of Figure5B/5C. Since the mapping is updated to reflect any changes in the document identifier, the file/document corresponding to the URL of step 460 is readily accessed. In step 490, content server 160 sends the content of the accessed document (either to web server 150 or client system 110 directly, depending on the specific approach used in the environment). The flowchart ends in step 499.<br>
[Para 50] Thus, using the approaches described above either alone or in combination, one may minimize problems in accessing referred content The approaches may be implemented in various embodiments. The description is continued with respect to embodiments in which the aspects of the invention are operative when appropriate software instructions are executed.<br>
[Para 51] 5. Digital Processing System<br>
[Para 52] Figure 6 is a block diagram illustrating the details of digital processing system 600 in which various aspects of the present invention are operative by execution of appropriate software instructions. Digital processing system 600 may correspond to content server 160 and/or web server 150. Digital processing system 600 may contain one or more processors such as central processing unit (CPU) 610, random access memory (RAM) 620, secondary memory630, graphics controller660, display unit670, network interface 680, and input interface 690. All the components except display unit 670 may communicate with each other over communication path 650, which may contain several buses as is well known in the relevant arts. The components of Figure 6 are described below in further detail.<br>
[Para 53] CPU 610 may execute instructions stored in RAM 620 to provide several features of the present invention. CPU 610 may contain multiple processing units, with each processing unit potentially being designed for a specific task. Alternatively, CPU 610 may contain only a single general purpose processing unit. RAM 620 may receive instructions from secondary memory 630 using communication path 650.<br>
[Para 54] Graphics controller 660 generates display signals (e.g., in RGB format) to display unit 670 based on data/instructions received from CPU 610. Display unit 670 contains a display screen to display the images defined by the display signals. Input interface 690 may correspond to a key-board and/or mouse. Network interface 680 provides connectivity to a network (e.g., using Internet Protocol). In the case of web server 150, network interface 680 provides network connectivity to both Intranet 170 and Internet 120, and in the case of content server 160 network interface 680 provides network connectivity to Intranet 170.<br>
(Para 55] Secondary memory 630 may contain hard drive 635, flash memory 636 and removable storage drive 637. Secondary memory 630 may store the data and software instructions, which enable digital processing system 600 to provide several features in accordance with the present invention. Some or all of the data and instructions may be provided on removable storage unit 640, and the data and instructions may be read and provided by removable storage drive 637 to CPU 610. Floppy drive, magnetic tape drive, CD-ROM drive, DVD Drive, Flash memory, removable memory chip (PCMCIA Card, EPROM) are examples of such removable storage drive 637.<br>
[Para 56] Removable storage unit 640 may be implemented using medium and storage format compatible with removable storage drive 637 such that removable storage drive 637 can read the data and instructions. Thus, removable storage unit 640 includes a computer readable storage medium having stored therein computer software and/or data.<br>
[Para 57] In this document, the term "computer program product" is used to generally refer to removable storage unit 640 or hard disk installed in hard drive 635. These computer program products are means for providing software to digital processing system 600. CPU 610 may retrieve the software instructions, and execute the instructions to provide various features of the present invention described above.<br>
