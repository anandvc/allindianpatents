				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to liquid-pourers which are of the<br>
kind for attachment to the neck of a bottle, and which<br>
comprise a spout-portion having a rear end for coupling<br>
externally to the bottle-neck and two elongate<br>
passageways extending parallel to one another between the<br>
rear and front ends of the spout-portion to open from and<br>
into the bottle respectively, a first of the passageways<br>
being operative for discharging liquid in pouring from<br>
the bottle and the second passageway being operative for<br>
admitting air to the bottle when the second passageway is<br>
located above the first passageway during pouring, and an<br>
elongate handle-portion attached to the spout-portion to<br>
extend both upwardly and rearwardly to overlie the bottle<br>
when the second passageway is above the first passageway<br>
during pouring as aforesaid.<br>
A liquid-pourer of the above-specified kind is known from<br>
CJS-A-5, 104,010, in which an internally-threaded<br>
cylindrical collar screws onto the externally-threaded<br>
neck of a bottle-container in retaining the bore of a<br>
spout-portion of the pourer aligned with the neck.  A<br>
tube attached to the internal cylindrical wall of the<br>
bore vents air to the container when a handle attached to<br>
the collar is tipped for pouring liquid from the<br>
container through the bore of the spout-portion.<br>
The Known pourer of US-A-5,104,010 has the disadvantage<br>
that weight of the container (including its liquid<br>
contents) is supported during pouring-by the container-<br>
neck through the external, screw-threaded collar-coupling<br>
to it.  The pourer includes a conical skirt which extends<br>
rearwardly from the collar to encase the container from<br>
the neck down throughout its shoulders, and although this<br>
Liquid-Pourers<br>
may have some benefit in reducing the load applied to the screw-threaded neck, there are<br>
manufacturing and economic disadvantages associated with the provision of a skirt of this<br>
form. More especially, the skirt of the known pourer limits the configuration of bottle-<br>
container with which the pourer can be used, or with which it can be used with any benefit.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a form of liquid-pourer of said above-<br>
specified kind that can be used to overcome the disadvantages of the known pourer.<br>
In the liquid-pourer in accordance with the invention, the rear end of the spout-portion has<br>
a rearwardly-projecting spigot for entry into the bottle-neck to take weight of the bottle<br>
during pouring.<br>
The liquid-pourer of the invention has the advantage that support for weight of the bottle<br>
during pouring is taken by the spigot within the neck of the bottle, and is accordingly not so<br>
dependent on the external coupling. With the pourer of US-A-5,104,010, support for the<br>
weight during pouring is taken principally by the external screw coupling to the neck, and<br>
although the crushing load this places on the neck may be relieved to some extent by the<br>
skirt, any such relief is very dependent on the configuration of bottle involved. With the<br>
pourer of the present invention, support is afforded within the bottle-neck, and this has the<br>
advantage that the tendency for the neck to be crushed under the weight of the bottle<br>
during pouring is significantly reduced or avoided, and furthermore, is not generally<br>
dependent on bottle-configuration.<br>
Although the use of a skirt in the liquid pourer of<br>
US-A-5,104,010 may have some benefit in reducing the load<br>
applied to the screw-threaded neck 12, there are<br>
manufacturing and economic disadvantages associated with<br>
the provision of a skirt of this form.  More especially,<br>
the configuration and diameter of the skirt limits<br>
critically the form of bottle-container with which the<br>
known pourer can be used, or with which it can be used<br>
with any benefit.  For the known pourer to be of any use<br>
at all, the bottle (in the case of the example of<br>
construction described in US-A-5,104,010) must be of<br>
circular cross-section, with a diameter that is no larger<br>
than that of the skirt, but not so small that the bottle<br>
does not nest closely within the skirt.  There is<br>
therefore a significant limitation on the configuration<br>
and size of bottle with which any specific construction<br>
of the pourer of US-A-5,104,010 can be used; the pourer<br>
inevitably lacks universality of possible use.<br>
The liquid-pourer of the present invention does not<br>
suffer from the disadvantages of the pourer of<br>
US-A-5,104,010 in that support for the bottle and its<br>
contents is not concentrated on external coupling with<br>
the bottle-neck, or dependent on a skirt that inevitably<br>
limits the size and configuration of bottle with which<br>
the pourer can be used beneficially.  Moreover, the<br>
pourer of the invention has the further advantage that<br>
with the spigot entered in the bottle-neck, external<br>
coupling to .the bottle need not be heavy in the sense of<br>
having to bear significant load.<br>
US-A-5, 487, 482 discloses a form of l:_quid-pourer that,<br>
like the pourer of US-A-5,104,010, has a conical skirt<br>
and screws onto the externally-threaded neck of the<br>
bottle.  The rear end of the spout-portion of this known<br>
form of pourer does not have a rearwardly-projecting<br>
spigot that enters the bottle-neck for taking werght of<br><br>
the bottle during pouring, and thus, similarly, lacks the<br>
advantageous features of the liquid-pourer of the present<br>
invention.<br>
The spigot of the liquid-pourer of the; present invention<br>
may be generally cylindrical for fitti.ng into the bottle-<br>
neck.  More especially, the spout-portion may be of a<br>
generally cylindrical form throughout its length.  In the<br>
latter case, the two passageways may be of complementary<br>
segmental cross-section and extend parallel to one<br>
another lengthwise of the spout-portion.<br>
External coupling of the spout-portion of the liquid-<br>
pourer of the invention to the neck of the bottle may be<br>
by means of screw-threaded attachment.  However, with the<br>
entered spigot taking weight, the external coupling need<br>
not be heavy in the sense of having to bear significant<br>
load.  More particularly, the external coupling may be<br>
achieved economically using just a resilient clip-element<br>
that snaps under a portion of the bottle-neck.<br>
The use of a clip for retaining a pourer attached to a<br>
bottle-container is known from DE-B-1172138, but the<br>
pourer in that case does not have the feature of a spigot<br>
for entering the neck of the bottle in taking weight of<br>
the bottle during pouring.<br>
Two forms of liquid-pourer according to the present<br>
invention will now'"be described, by way of example, with<br>
reference to the accompanying, drawings, in which:<br>
Figure 1 is a perspective view from the front of a first<br>
of the two liquid-pourers according to the invention;<br>
Figure 2 is a sectional side elevation to an enlarged<br>
scale, of part of the liquid-pourer cf Figure 1;<br>
Figure 3 shows the liquid-pourer of Figure 1 attached to<br>
a bottle;<br>
Figure 4 is a sectional side-elevation of the second<br>
liquid-pourer according to the invention; and<br>
Figure 5 is illustrative of attachment of the liquid-<br>
pourer of Figure 4 to a bottle.<br>
Referring to Figures 1 and 2, the first liquid-pourer is<br>
of moulded plastics and has a substantially cylindrical<br>
spout-portion 1 that is for coupling to the screw-<br>
threaded neck of a bottle.  A handle-portion 2 for use in<br>
holding and guiding the pourer during use, is moulded<br>
integrally with the spout-portion 1 and extends both<br>
upwardly and rearwardly from a head-part 3 of it.  Two<br>
passageways 4 and 5 of complementary segmental cross-<br>
section extend parallel to one another from front to rear<br>
of the spout-portion 1, the passageway 4 being for<br>
discharge of liquid from the bottle during pouring,<br>
whereas the passageway 5 is for admitting air to<br>
facilitate smoothness of that discharcfe.  In this regard,<br>
the passageway 5 is located closer to the handle-portion<br>
2 so as; to be above the passageway 4 when the handle-<br>
portion 2 is held during pouring.<br>
The handle-portion 2 extends upwardly and rearwardly from<br>
the portion 1 in a generous curve to terminate in an<br>
integral ring 6.  The ring 6 is for use in retaining, by<br>
push fit, the cap of the bottle to which the pourer is<br>
+attached.  In this regard, once the cap of the bottle has<br>
been removed and located in the ring 6, the spout-portion<br>
1 is located on the bottle.  More particularly, a<br>
rearwardly-projecting spigot 7 of the spout-portion 1 is<br>
entered in the neck of the bottle to bring an internally-<br>
threaded collar 8 of the head-part 3 into engagement with<br>
the external screw-thread of the bottle-neck; the collar<br>
8 is moulded separately from the rest of the pourer and<br>
is snapped, fixedly and water-tightly, onto the head-part<br>
3.  The pourer is then screwed onto the; bottle-neck to<br>
hold it fast to the bottle as illustrated in Figure 3.<br>
With the pourer screwed to a cylindrical (2 litre) bottle<br>
10 as illustrated in Figure 3, the handle-portion 2<br>
extends outwardly from the bottle-neck 11 and down<br>
alongside, but spaced from, the cylindrical bottle-wall<br>
12.  The configuration of the handle-portion 2 is<br>
convenient for holding with one hand, whether carrying<br>
the bottle 10 upright or inclined away from the vertical<br>
for pouring.  Whatever orientation of the bottle 10 is<br>
desired, and whatever its liquid content, there is in<br>
general a suitable location on the handle-portion 2 where<br>
it can be readily held comfortably by hand, with good<br>
balance.<br>
As illustrated in Figures 1 to 3, the spout-portion 1 has<br>
a screw-threaded nose 13 that allows, for example, a rose<br>
or other spray-producing accessory, to be coupled to the<br>
pourer for use during pouring.  Moreover, it allows the<br>
bottle-cap 14 retained by the ring 6 (Figure 3) to be<br>
removed and screwed onto the pourer to cap it and the<br>
bottle 10 as one while they remain attached to one<br>
another.<br>
The pourer described above with reference to Figures 1 to<br>
3 is attached to the bottle 10 by means of screw-threaded<br>
interengagement between the collar 8 and the bottle-neck<br>
11.  However, except when the bottle 10 is held vertical,<br>
most of its weight is taken by the spigot 7 entered in<br>
the neck 11 so attachment of the pourer to the bottle<br>
need not be heavy.  An alternative form of the pourer in<br>
which attachment is by means of a clip, is illustrated in<br>
Figures 4 and 5.<br>
Referring to Figures 4 and 5, the liquid-pourer in this<br>
case is moulded as one piece with a clip element 15<br>
attached to a circumferential rim 16 of the spout-portion<br>
17.  When the spigot 18 of the portion 17 is inserted in<br>
a bottle 19, the rim 16 is brought down onto the top of<br>
the bottle-neck 20 with the element L5 extending down the<br>
outside of the neck 20.  The element 15 has a hook-end 21<br>
and a degree of resilience in itself and in its<br>
attachment to the rim 16 by which the hook-end 21 snaps<br>
under the bottom rim 22 of the neck 20 as the rim 16<br>
comes into abutment with the top of rhe neck 20, as<br>
illustrated in Figure 5.  This holds the rim 16 hard on<br>
the neck 20 to retain the pourer firmly and water—tightly<br>
attached to the bottle 19.  Release of the pourer from<br>
attachment to the bottle 19 is achieved by pulling a<br>
lever-arm 23 of the clip-element 15 upwardly, so as to<br>
free the hook-end 21 from the rim 22.<br>
The handle-portion 2 4 in this case is shown without<br>
provision for holding the cap of the bottle 19.<br>
The liquid-pourers described above may be readily used<br>
for garden watering, and in this respect may be used for<br>
economy with a plastics bottle (usually transparent or<br>
semi-transparent) which previously contained bottled<br>
water or other soft drink and which otherwise would be<br>
discarded.  Because of the ready availability of bottles<br>
of this nature, a number may first b= filled with water,<br>
and the pourer attached to them in turn as each is<br>
emptied.  A pourer of the form described above may also<br>
be used in the first place for dispensing the bottled-<br>
water or other soft drink for consumption, and indeed<br>
such a pourer may be adapted for attachment to the neck<br>
of a wine bottle and used for dispensincf the wine<br>
therefrom.<br>
