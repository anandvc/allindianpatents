				<td>Title :    HIV regulatory and auxiliary peptides, antigens, vaccine compositions, immunoassay kit and a method of detecting antibodies induced by HIV."<br>
The present invention relates to novel peptides based on conserved regions of the regulatory and auxiliary HIV proteins, antigens in free or carrier-bound form comprising at least one of the said peptides, vaccine compositions containing at least one of the antigens, immunoassay kits and a method of detecting antibodies, induced by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or HIV-specific peptides, using such antigens.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), the causative agent of acquired<br>
immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) continues to present a formidable challenge to health in developing countries. In the Western world, therapeutic strategies that target HIV-1 replication and maturation have had a prominent impact on disease progression. The high cost of current treatment, high toxicity of the drugs and lack of cure , however, means that the development of safe and effective vaccines remains paramount for control of the AIDS pandemic.<br>
HIV-1 is a complex retrovirus encoding six regulatory and auxiliary genes not found in the simple retroviruses, namely, tat, rev, nef, vif, vprand vpu (Table 1). In eukaryotic cells, only completely spliced mRNAs are exported to the cytoplasm for translation. Unspliced or partially spliced RNAs are retained and eventually degraded in the nucleus. In this way, proteins encoded by the tat, rev and nef genes (designated Tat, Rev and Nef) derived from multiply spliced RNA species, are expressed first and constitute early HIV-1 gene expression. In order to express singly spliced RNAs and also to transport the full length unspliced RNA genome into the cytoplasm for packaging, HIV-1 has developed means to overcome the restrictions on RNA transport. The regulatory proteins, Tat and Rev, are essential for HIV-1 replication since mutations in these proteins eliminate HIV-1 production (Dayton A.I., et.al. (1986) Cell, 44:941-947, and Fisher, A.G., et.al. (1986) Nature, 320:367-371.). The auxiliary genes are derived from exons positioned entirely upstream of the HIV-1 envelope gene e.g. vif or exons upstream of as well as within env but in different reading frames e.g. tat, rev. The efficiency of splicing in part regulates the levels of gene expression of the different auxiliary proteins.<br>
Following integration of HIV-1 proviral DNA, predominantly truncated forms of mRNA are synthesised by the cellular RNA polymerase II which interacts with sites on the 5'<br><br>
long terminal repeat (LTR) of the proviral DMA. tat is one of the first genes to be expressed and carries a nuclear localisation signal. It is a potent transcriptional activator that enhances LTR-directed transcription up to a thousand fold. Continuous expression of Tat ensures a positive feed back loop for continued high level gene expression. Unlike conventional transcriptional activators that interact with DMA sequences, Tat binds directly to the 5' ends of all HIV-1 RNAs at a specific stem-loop secondary structure, TAR (transactivating response element). The structure of the loop is highly conserved and essential for Tat function. The structure of the Tat/TAR interaction has been analysed using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) (Puglisi et al. (1992) Science, 257:76-80). Tat binds TAR in association with the cellular protein, cyclin T, which in turn binds CDK9 that phosphorylates the RNA polymerase II C-terminal domain, thereby promoting the elongation of RNA transcripts. These Tat cellular cofactors are only present in activated cells, their absence represses transcription of proviral DMA resulting in a 'quasi latency' in T lymphocytes. Tat is expressed from two exons, both the nuclear localisation signal and the TAR binding region are located in the first exon. Tat is secreted from infected cells and can exert heterologous effects on neighbouring cells. These include cellular activation (Hofman et al. (1993) Blood, 82:2774-2780.), induction of cellular apoptosis (Macho et al. (1999) Oncogene, 18:7543-7551.1999) functioning as a secretable growth factor (Trinh, DP. et.al. (1999) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun., 256:299-306.) and modulating host cell protein synthesis in favour of viral protein synthesis (Xiao et al. (1998) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun., 244:384-389.1998). Therapeutic strategies targeting Tat will therefore have a strong impact on HIV-1 infection. The small multiply spliced mRNAs encoding Tat, Rev and Nef predominate during early phase after infection. When a threshold level of Rev is produced, unspliced and singly spliced RNAs accumulate in the cytoplasm for translation, allowing productive infection to proceed. Failure to generate this threshold level of Rev may contribute to HIV quasi latency. Rev can only bind to RNAs carrying an RNA structure, RRE (Rev responsive element) which is located in the env coding region of the genome. Rev interacts with the RRE as a multimer through a basic arginine rich region present in the amino terminal half of the protein. A consequence of this interaction is the transport of partially spliced RNAs that will provide gene products such as Env, Vif, Vpu and Vpr as well as unspliced RNAs that will serve as new genomes for incorporation into assembling particles. Structural analysis of the Rev/RRE interaction has also been carried out using NMR (Battiste et al. (1996) Science, 273:1547-1551.1996). Rev carries a leucine<br><br>
rich export signal that allows it to shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm for continued transport of newly synthesised RNAs (Kalland et al. (1994). J. Viral., 68:1475-1485; Meyer &amp; Malim, (1994) Genes Dev., 8:1538-1547.). In this way, Rev ensures that the structural genes are expressed late following the regulatory genes. Therapeutic strategies directed against Rev will interrupt the viral life cycle early in infection.<br>
Although originally described as a negative factor, Nef has later been shown to have positive effects on virus replication and is expressed in larger quantities than that of Tat and Rev, both early and throughout infection. Nef is myristylated at the N-terminus and is associated with the inner side of the plasma membrane. Nef is partly responsible for down regulation and degradation of surface CD4 by endocytosis (Piguet et al. (1998) EMBO J., 17:2472-2481.). Removing CD4 from the cell surface prevents superinfection with other HIV-1 strains, or reinfection with newly released virus. Nef is also responsible for the down regulation of MHC class I thereby protecting infected cells from destruction by cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (Le Gall et al. (1997). Res. Virol., 148:43-47.). Nef is not an essential viral protein since it is not required for in vitro infection of peripheral blood lymphocytes or T-cell lines. Nef deletion mutants, however, are less pathogenic over long periods of time. Nef also has complex effects on signal transduction pathways in the cell and contains a proline rich region that can interact with the SH3 domain of kinases involved in T-cell activation, a feature necessary for efficient HIV replication (Moarefi et al. (1997). Nature, 385:650-653.). Nef containing viruses are capable of more viral DNA synthesis than viruses deleted in the Nef gene which suggests that Nef directly or indirectly activates the viral reverse transcriptase. The low level of Nef associated with virions may be responsible for this phenomenon. Low levels of Nef are also released from infected cells although the potential effect on neighbouring cells is unclear. Since Nef is expressed early in infection and has significant effects on CD4 and MHC class I expression as well as disease progression, it represents an important target for future therapeutic strategies.<br>
Tat and Nef are secreted and can be taken up by macrophages and expressed in association with MHC class II molecules. This improves their suitability as targets for peptide based therapies which also would be expressed in the context of MHC class II. It is clear that targeting early gene products that are essential for HIV-1 replication, such as Tat and Rev should be given priority in addition to Nef which is also expressed early and influences disease progression.<br><br>
(Table Remove)     HIV-1 Regulatory and auxiliary proteins.<br><br>
Naturally occurring HIV sequences in vaccine candidates are not capable of stimulating a stable longterm immune response due to HIVs inherent ability to hide by changing the appearance of the epitopes presented for the immune system. To overcome this variable presentation of epitopes, certain amino acid substitutions and amino acid combinations will support the immune system to present and recognize these foreign virus antigens in a reliable manner and thus to a greater extent.<br>
Based on the above background, we decided to investigate the possibility<br>
of designing novel synthetic peptides which can mimic the epitopes from the regulatory and auxiliary HIV proteins in such a way that they can be exposed for both the humoral as well as the cellular part of the immune system, to meet the need for an effective therapeutic and/or prophylactic vaccine.<br>
The initital work was based on the native Tat amino acid sequences published by Korber B., et al., Human Retroviruses and AIDS 1997 Eds.Theoretical Biology and Biophysics Group, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM. The first Tat epitope is located between amino acid 1 and amino acid 24 of the tat protein:<br>

The one letter as well as the three letter codes defining the amino acids in the sequences given throughout this specification are in accordance with International standards and given in textbooks, for instance Lehninger A.L., «Principles of Biochemistry», Worth Publishers Inc., New York, 1982. The amino acids given to the right of the left column, represent the natural variation of the sequence. Our analyses resulted in a sequence containing this modified epitope:<br>
CSWVNPRLEPWLHPGSQPNITACTN<br>
Wherein Nl indicates 2-aminohexanoic acid (Norleucine, abbreviated Nle and Nl in the three letter and one letter code, respectively) and the cysteine residues are in an oxidized state, i.e. are forming an intrachain disulphide bridge. Since the Cystein residue to the C-terminal part (in position 22) of the peptide is part of an intramolecular disulfide bond outside this selected epitope, a similar intrapeptide disulphide bond is formed by placing a Cystein in the N-terminal part of the selected epitope. Another alternative is to form an intermolecular disulphide bond by dimerization of the sequences :<br>
WVNPRLEPWLHPGSQPNITACTN<br>
I<br>
WVNPRLEPWLHPGSQPNITACTN<br>
A further alternative is dimerization with another epitope selected from Tat. The second epitope on Tat is located between amino acid 35 and 57 in C-terminal direction, separated from the first epitope by 10 amino acids containing 5 Cys residues in addition to the Cys residue in each of the epitopes. The relatively high number of Cys residues offers a variety of inter- and intramolecular crosslinking possibilities. It is likely that this Cys-rich domain will dominate the immunological exposure of this protein and hence cause a "hiding" of the two relevant epitopes. Selection and modification of the two adjacent epitopes can expose an essential part of the Tat protein in a more optimal way.<br>
In order to reduce the probability for development of escape mutants, the number of epitopes is further increased and two additional peptide sequences were selected. These sequences are located on Rev (residues 58-78) and Nef (residues 65-85). The native sequences have been published in Human Retroviruses and AIDS 1999; A Compilation and Analysis of Nucleic Acid and Amino Acid Sequences.

The new peptide sequences have the potential to serve as a good antigen wherein the antigen comprises at least one peptide selected from the group of sequences of SEQ ID NO : 1, SEQ ID NO : 4, SEQ ID NO : 7 or SEQ ID NO : 10 . The antigenicity may be adapted through adjusting the ratio or concentration of different peptides or size of the peptides by for instance dimerization or polymerization and/or immobilization to a solid phase. The antigen comprises one or more polypeptide sequences, according to the invention, which could be either linked by a bridge for instance a disulphide bridge between the Cys residues of the chains or bridges like C-i-Caalkylen possibly intervened by one or more heteroatoms like O, S, or N or preferably they are unlinked. The chains may be immobilized to a solid phase in monomeric, dimeric or oligomeric forms. Further amino acids may be added to the ends in order to achieve an «arm» to facilitate immobilization.<br>
PEG is polyethylene glycol (HO(CH2CH2O)a H and can be part of the linker -Z-, optionally PEG is modified by a dicarboxylic acid (HO(CH2CH2O)a CO(CH2)b COOH) or a terminal carboxylic group (HO(CH2CH2O)a.iCH2COOH) where a = 1-10 and b = 2-6, prior to linking.<br>
The linker-Z- can either consist of PEG, modified PEG, or a combination thereof and/or one or more Gly residues combined. Alternatively the linker-Z- can consist of a Gly-bridge [Gly]n where n = 1, 2 or 3.<br>
All amino acids in the peptides of the invention can be in both D- or L-form, although the naturally occurring L- form is preferred.<br>
The C- and N-terminal ends of the peptide sequences could deviate from the natural sequences by modification of the terminal NH2-group and/or COOH-group, they may for instance be acylated, acetylated, amidated or modified to provide a binding site for a carrier or another molecule.<br>
The peptides according to the invention are consisting of 6 to 50 amino acids, preferably between 10 and 30 amino acids. They are covering all natural variation of amino acids in the identified positions.<br><br>
The polypeptide antigen according to the invention is either in a free or in a carrier-bound form. The carrier or solid phase to which the peptide is optionally bound can be selected from a vide variety of known carriers. It should be selected with regard to the intended use of the immobilized polypeptide as a diagnostic antigen or as an immunizing component in a vaccine.<br>
Examples of carriers that can be used for e.g. diagnostic purposes are magnetic beads or latex of co-polymers such as styrene-divinyl benzene, hydroxylated styrene-divinyl benzene, polystyrene, carboxylated polystyrene, beads of carbon black, non-activated or polystyrene or polyvinyl chloride activated glass, epoxy-activated porous magnetic glass, gelatine or polysaccharide particles or other protein particles, red blood cells, mono- or polyclonal antibodies or fab fragments of such antibodies.<br>
According to a further embodiment of the present invention, the antigens may form part of a vaccine possibly combined with carriers, adjuvants or combined with other immunostimulating elements such as canarypox virus carrying the envgene. Examples of carriers and/or adjuvants for vaccine purposes are other proteins such as human or bovine serum albumin and keyhole limpet haemocyanin and fatty acids. Immunostimulatory materials may be divided into three groups; adjuvants, carriers for antigens and vehicles. Examples of adjuvants include aluminum hydroxyd, aluminum salts, saponin, muramyl di and tripeptides, monophosphoryl lipid A, palmitic acid, B.pertussis and various cytokines including the Th1 cytokine IL-12 and IL-1. A number of protein toxins can be used to carry passenger proteins across cellular membranes into the cytosol, which are useful in developing CTL vaccines. Carriers include bacterial toxoids such as inactivated tetanus and cholera toxins, genetically detoxified bacterial toxins such as heat labile enterotoxin from E.coli, fatty acids, live vectors such as polio chimeras and hybrid proteins that form particulates for example yeast retrotransposon hybrid TY particles and HBcAg particles. Vehicles which are frequently occurring components in modern vaccines are consisting of mineral oil emulsion, Freunds complete and incomplete adjuvant, vegetable oil emulsions, nonionic block co-polymer surfactants, squalene or squalane, lipopeptides, liposomes and biodegradable microspheres. Two novel adjuvants which possess significant potential for the development of new vaccines include an oil-in-water microemulsion (MF59) and polymeric microparticles. Any substance that can enhance the immunogenicity of the<br><br>
antigen may be used and several further alternatives of carriers or adjuvants are given in the US or European Pharmacopoeia.<br>
A suitable formulation of the antigen for immunostimulatory uses may also comprise interferons such as INF-y, antiviral chemokines or haematopoietic growth factors such as granulocyte macrophage growth factor.<br>
Another approach in order to enhance the stimulation and absorption in for instance the intestine is to administer the peptides of the invention, with small peptides such as di, tri or tetrapeptides. These peptides can be administered in addition to or in combination with the peptides of the invention. Preferably the peptides are administered together with the tripeptide YGG, consisting of amino acids in the D- or L-forms, preferably in the D-form.<br>
Recent approaches to non-parenteral delivery of vaccines, for instance via mucosa include; gene fusion technology to create non-toxic derivatives of mucosal adjuvants, genetically inactivated antigens with a deletion in an essential gene, coexpression of an antigen and a specific cytokine that is important in the modulation and control of a mucosal immune response, and genetic material itself that would allow DMA or RNA uptake and its endogenous expression in the host's cells.<br>
One approach for developing durable responses where cell-mediated immunity is required, is to vaccinate with plasmid DMA encoding one or more specific antigen(s).<br>
In order to protect against HIV infection, vaccines should induce both mucosal and systemic immune responses and could be administered by any convenient route, parenterally or non-parenterally, such as subcutanously, intracutanously, intravenously, intramuscularly, perorally, mucosally or intranasally for example.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the vaccine according to the present invention it comprises antigens containing peptides selected from at least one of the groups of the SEQ ID NO: 1, 4, 7 and 10, more preferred the different peptides occur in equal amounts.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment the vaccine composition contains the antigens ;<br><br>
FVIHRLEPWLHPGSQHNITASTN -NH2 (SEQ ID NO :14) and<br>
RLVGFPVKPQVPGLLRPLTYKAA-NH2 (SEQ ID NO :15).<br>
The sequences can activate the cellular immune system, and contribute with CTL-epitopes. The amino acid changes implemented within the frame of the CTL-epitopes are designed to achieve enhanced binding. Other amino acid changes have been conducted in order to facilitate the synthesis of the peptide and/or increase the solubility of the peptide.<br>
A method for detecting antibodies, induced by HIV-1 or HIV-1 specific peptides or proteins, in a sample of body fluid using the present antigens is a further embodiment of the invention. Also immunoassay kit designed for this detection and antibodies capable of selectively reacting with the said antigens are encompassed by the present invention.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PREPARATION OF THE PEPTIDES<br>
The peptides of the invention can be produced by any known method of producing a linear amino acid sequence, such as recombinant DNA techniques. A nucleic acid sequence that encodes one or more peptides of the invention or a multimer of the said peptides, is introduced into an expression vector. Suitable expression vectors are for instance plasmids, cosmids, viruses and YAC (yeast artifical chromosome) which comprise necessary control regions for replication and expression. The expression vector may be stimulated to expression in a host cell. Suitable host cells are for example bacteria, yeast cells and mammal cells. Such techniques are well known in the art and described for instance by Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, 1989. Other well-known techniques are degradation or synthesis by coupling of one amino acid residue to the next one in liquid phase or preferably on a solid phase (resin) for instance by the so-called Merrifield synthesis. See for instance Barany and Merrifield in the Peptides, Analysis, Synthesis, Biology, Vol.2, E. Gross and Meinhofer, Ed. (Acad.Press, N.Y.,<br><br>
1980), Kneib-Coronier and Mullen Int. J. Peptide Protein Res., 30, p.705-739 (1987) and Fields and Noble Int.J.Peptide Protein Res., 35, p.161-214 (1990).<br>
In case a linked or cyclic peptide is desired, the amino acid sequence is subjected to a chemical oxidation step in order to cyclize or link the two cysteine residues within one or between two peptide sequences, when the appropriate linear amino acid sequences are synthesized, see Akaji et al., Tetrahedron Letter, 33, 8, p.1073-1076, 1992.<br>
GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF SYNTHESIS<br>
All peptide derivatives prepared in the Examples given below were synthesized on a Milligen 9050 Peptide Synthesizer using a standard program. The resin used was Tenta Gel P RAM with a theoretical loading of 0,20 meq/g (RAPP POLYMERE GmbH, Tubingen). The final product of the synthesis was dried in vacuuo overnight. The peptide was then cleaved from the resin by treatment with 90% trifluoroacetic acid in the presence of ethandithiol (5%) and water (5%) as scavengers (1,5 hours at RT). Then the resin was filtered and washed on filter with additional trifluoro acetic acid (100%) (2 x 20 ml). The combined filtrates were evaporated in vacuuo (water bath at RT) and the residue was triturated with ethyl ether (200 ml) and the precipitated product filtered off. The solid was promptly dissolved on filter with glacial acetic acid (100 ml) and added to 1,5 I of 20% acetic acid in methanol and treated with 0,1 M solution of iodine in methanol until a faint brown colour remained. Then Dowex 1 x 8 ion exchange in acetate form (15g) (Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA) was added and the mixture filtered. The filtrate was evaporated and the residue freeze-dried from acetic acid. The product was then purified by reversed phase liquid chromatography on a column filled with Kromasil® 100 - 5 C8 (EKA Nobel, Surte, Sweden) in a suitable system containing acetonitrile in 0,1 % trifluoro acetic acid water solution. The samples collected from the column were analyzed by analytical high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (Beckman System Gold, USA) equipped with a Kromasil® 100 - 5 C8 Column (EKA Nobel, Surte, Sweden). Fractions containing pure substance were pooled, the solvent was evaporated and the product freeze-dried from acetic acid. The final HPLC analysis was performed on final product, and the structure of the peptide was confirmed by amino acid analysis and mass spectrometry (LDI-MS).<br><br>
All amino acids used during the synthesis were L-amino acids and they were protected with a fluorenyl methoxy-carbonyl group at the a-amino function. The side chains were protected as follows:<br>
Cys (Trt), Gln(Trt), Glu(OtBu), Thr(tBu).<br>
The abbreviations, within the brackets are :<br>
Trt = triphenyl methyl<br>
t-Bu = tert. Butyl<br>
OtBu = tert. Butyl ester<br>
The amino acid derivatives were supplied by Bachem AG, Switzerland.<br>
