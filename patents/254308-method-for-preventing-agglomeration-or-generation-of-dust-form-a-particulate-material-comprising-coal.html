FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This present invention relates to a product found to be useful for dust control<br>
and freeze control. This product may be applied on surfaces containing particles or<br>
particulate matter.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Dust from traffic on dirt roads and from the handling of bulk products with<br>
attendant particulate materials can create significant health, environmental and safety<br>
problems. In mining facilities, industrial sites and construction sites, the operations<br>
may be significantly restricted by dust cloud formation. Also, health, environmental<br>
and safety problems may arise when any kind of dust is inhaled<br>
Known dust controlling agents include oils, paper making byproducts such as<br>
ligno-sulfonate dispersions, and water, optionally containing various salts such as<br>
magnesium and calcium chloride, or sodium chloride. Also, as described in U.S.<br>
Patent 6,589,442, a partially saponified mixture of crude tall oil and vegetable oil,<br>
emulsified in water, may be used as a dust control agent.<br>
However, further problems arise in dust control when the temperature drops<br>
well below freezing. During cold winters, the dust problems can persist even in<br>
subfreezing temperatures, particularly in operations such as coal mining. Also, even<br>
without dust problems, freshly mined coal may carry a significant amount of moisture,<br>
which can freeze. The freezing of the moisture on the surface of the coal and in the<br>
coal causes the chunks of coal to agglomerate into large, unwieldy lumps. Also, in<br>
cold weather, this moisture may cause lumps of coal to freeze to the metal walls of<br>
hopper cars and railroad cars that are used to transport the coal, which causes problems<br><br>
of materials handling. The same can apply to other divided materials, and, dust can be<br>
generated from the handling of such coal, as well as from the handling of other<br>
particulate products such as sand, at any temperature.<br>
It would be desirable to identify an economical and highly-effective agent mat<br>
provides freeze control to prevent agglomeration and bonding of moist, particulate<br>
materials even at very low temperatures on the order of about -20째C and below, while<br>
also providing dust control at any temperature.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The first aspect of the instant claimed invention is a product for dust control<br>
and freeze control, wherein said product comprises a mixture of from about 45 to<br>
about 90 weight percent of glycerin, from about 5 to about 50 weight percent of water<br>
and from about 2 to about 15 weight percent of a water soluble salt, and wherein the<br>
freezing point of said product is typically no more than about -20째C, for example<br>
about -35째C.<br>
The second aspect of the instant claimed invention is a product for dust control<br>
and freeze control comprising a crude glycerin solution, wherein said crude glycerin<br>
solution comprises glycerin, water and a water soluble salt, and wherein said crude<br>
glycerin solution is derived from vegetable oils or is formed as a byproduct from a<br>
biodiesel manufacturing process of forming fatty acids from vegetable oils.<br>
The third aspect of the instant claimed invention is a method of preventing the<br>
agglomeration of particulate material and the adhesion thereof to surfaces in<br>
subfreezing temperatures, which comprises:<br>
applying an effective amount of a product for freeze control, wherein said<br>
product comprises an effective mixture of glycerin, water, and a water soluble salt in<br><br>
an amount sufficient to wet the surface of the particulate material and to substantially<br>
prevent freezing thereof at the temperature of use, to suppress agglomeration of the<br>
particulate material and its adhesion to surfaces, such as the metal surfaces of railroad<br>
cars, hopper cars, and conveyor belts. Also, the product of this invention can be used<br>
to prevent ice build-up on such surfaces, by direct application to the surfaces, in the<br>
manner of airplane wing deicing, with or without the presence of particulate material.<br>
The fourth aspect of the instant claimed invention is a method of preventing the<br>
generation of dust from particulate materials, which comprises:<br>
applying to said particulate material a product for dust control,<br>
wherein said product comprises a mixture of glycerin, water, and a water soluble salt<br>
in an amount sufficient to wet the surface of the particulate material and to<br>
substantially prevent the generation of dust from said particulate material.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
By this invention, a new, inexpensive, environmentally safe, long lasting dust<br>
control and freeze control agent is provided, which can be used at essentially any<br>
temperature, but is particularly advantageous over other agents at subfreezing<br>
temperatures, for control of dust from dirt roads, as well as from piles of particulate<br>
materials, while being capable of preventing freeze agglomeration and freeze adhesion<br>
of wet, particulate materials.<br>
The first aspect of the instant claimed invention is a product for dust control<br>
and freeze control, which product typically comprises a mixture of about 45 to about<br>
90 weight percent of glycerin; about 5 to about 50 weight percent of water; and<br>
about 2 to about 15 weight percent of a water soluble salt, such as sodium or potassium<br>
chloride;<br><br>
Glycerin is a commercial product available from chemical supply companies.<br>
Any source of water, including tap water and raw water, may be used to supply<br>
the water required for the concentrated product<br>
Concerning the requirement that there be included a water soluble salt, it has<br>
been found that, if desired, calcium chloride may also be added along with, or as a<br>
substitute for, the sodium or potassium chloride. Other inorganic and organic salts<br>
may also be used. These inorganic and organic salts are known to people of ordinary<br>
skill in the art of formulation chemistry.<br>
This product may also contain trace amounts of other ingredients such as, but<br>
not limited to, free fatty acids and esters thereof and alcohols, such as methanol. It is<br>
believed that these trace amounts of other ingredients do not significantly detract from<br>
the dust control properties of the product. It is also believed that these trace amounts<br>
of other ingredients do not significantly detract from the freeze protection<br>
characteristics of the product. Therefore, these trace materials are tolerable in the<br>
product, but typically all of them together make up no more than about 5 weight<br>
percent of the product.<br>
As stated, the instant claimed invention is a product for dust control and freeze<br>
control, which comprises a mixture of about 45 to about 90 weight percent of glycerin;<br>
about 5 to about 50 weight percent of water; and about 2 to about 15 weight percent of<br>
a water soluble salt. A preferred composition of mis product is from about 50 to about<br>
90 weight percent glycerin, from about 5 to about 45 weight percent water and from<br>
about 3 to about 10 weight percent water soluble salt. Some embodiments of the<br>
product comprise from about 60 to about 90 weight percent glycerin, from about 5 to<br><br>
about 38 weight percent water and from about 4 to about 10 weight percent water<br>
soluble salt.<br>
A second aspect of the instant claimed invention is a product for dust control<br>
and freeze control comprising a crude glycerin solution, wherein said crude glycerin<br>
solution comprises glycerin, water and a water soluble salt, and wherein said crude<br>
glycerin solution is derived from vegetable oils or is formed as a byproduct from a<br>
biodiesel manufacturing process of forming fatty acid esters from vegetable oils.<br>
Crude glycerin may be derived from vegetable oils, either during<br>
manufacturing of fatty acids or by using recycled vegetable oils as a source material.<br>
One such derivation is the formation of crude glycerin from a manufacturing process<br>
for making fatty acid esters from at least one oil selected from the group consisting of<br>
soybean oil and canola oil. Another derivation uses recycled vegetable oils from fast<br>
food restaurants as a source material for the crude glycerin. Other methods of deriving<br>
crude glycerin from animal and vegetable oils are known to people of ordinary skill in<br>
the art of glycerin. It is preferred to use crude glycerin derived from vegetable oils and<br>
that are obtained from oil seeds.<br>
Crude glycerin may also be formed as a byproduct from a biodiesel<br>
manufacturing process for forming fatty acid esters from vegetable oils, preferably<br>
ethyl and methyl esters of particularly soybean oil and canola oil. However, other oils<br>
may be used. Biodiesel production processes are well known. There are three basic<br>
routes to biodiesel production from fat-containing oils from living things, particularly<br>
oilseeds, namely (1) base catalyzed transesterification of the oil; (2) direct acid<br>
catalyzed transesterification of the oil; (3) conversion of the oil to its fatty acids, and<br>
then to biodiesel.<br><br>
Most of the biodiesel produced today is conventionally done with the base<br>
catalyzed reaction, because of its high conversion of fatty acids directly to the ester<br>
form with minimal side reactions and reaction time. For example, 100 pounds of<br>
vegetable oil comprising fatty acid triglycerides may be reacted with an appropriate<br>
amount of ethyl or methyl alcohol, for example 10 pounds, to yield about 10 pounds of<br>
glycerin and about 100 pounds of biodiesel quality fatty acid methyl or ethyl ester. Of<br>
course, variation in the proportions and types of ingredients may be used.<br>
The base used for the reaction is typically sodium hydroxide or potassium<br>
hydroxide, being dispersed in the alcohol used (typically ethanol or methanol), with<br>
standard agitation or mixing. The alcohol/base mix may then be charged into a closed<br>
reaction vessel, and the vegetable oil is added. The system is then closed, and<br>
typically held at about 71 째C (160째F) for a period of about 1 to 8 hours, although some<br>
systems recommend that the reaction take place at room temperature. An excess of<br>
alcohol is normally used to insure almost total fat/oil conversion to ester form.<br>
Once the reaction is complete, two major products have been formed: crude<br>
glycerin and biodiesel fatty acid esters. Excess alcohol may be recovered by<br>
distillation or another conventional manner, and the crude glycerin can generally be<br>
drawn off the bottom of a settling vessel. The crude glycerin is on the alkaline side<br>
because of the presence of the sodium or potassium hydroxide. It is preferably<br>
neutralized with an acid such as hydrochloric acid, thus forming a inorganic salt in the<br>
glycerin.<br>
It is this crude neutralized glycerin which can be the product of the second<br>
aspect of the instant claimed invention. The crude glycerin byproduct is quite<br>
inexpensive, much cheaper than the pure glycerin that can be refined from it, so the<br><br>
material used in this invention is an economical dust control and freeze control agent,<br>
which remains useable at very low temperatures, and is highly effective for settling<br>
dust.<br>
The product comprising crude glycerin derived from vegetable oils or from<br>
biodiesel processes typically comprises from about 78 to 84 weight percent glycerin,<br>
from about 7 to about 16 weight percent water and from about 6 to about 9 weight<br>
percent inorganic salts. The crude glycerin also may contain trace amounts of<br>
materials without a detrimental effect upon its efficacy as either a dust control agent or<br>
as a freeze conditioning agent. These trace amounts of materials typically are from<br>
about 0.5 to about 3 weight percent ethanol or methanol, fatty acids, and esters thereof.<br>
The third aspect of the instant claimed invention is a method of preventing the<br>
agglomeration of particulate material and the adhesion thereof to surfaces such as<br>
those of metal cars, bins, and conveyor belts, in subfreezing temperatures. The method<br>
comprises: applying to said particulate material and/or directly to the metal surfaces an<br>
effective amount of a product, which product comprises a mixture of glycerin, water<br>
and a water soluble salt.<br>
The third aspect of the instant claimed invention relates to a method of<br>
preventing the agglomeration of particulate materials, such as coal, iron ore, bauxite,<br>
wood chips and the like. Coal is considered a "particulate", even though the majority<br>
of the coal may be found in rather large chunks. Metal surfaces are particularly<br>
vulnerable to such adhesion by lumps of wet coal or other particulate minerals under<br>
very cold conditions, because of the high heat transfer properties of metal, and because<br>
coal and certain other particulate minerals are stored in metal bins and transported in<br>
metal rolling hoppers, railroad cars and conveyor belts.<br><br>
An advantage of the product of this invention arises from the use of an aqueous<br>
glycerin mixture, which is known to have a depressed freezing point, plus the presence<br>
of a water soluble salt such as sodium chloride, which provides unexpectedly great<br>
additional freezing point depression when compared with pure glycerin and water, so<br>
that the product, even when diluted with additional water, is easily used at subfreezing<br>
temperatures. For example, the freezing point of the material may be typically no<br>
more than -20째C, for example about -35째C.<br>
For example, it is known that a 50% water solution of pure glycerin begins to<br>
freeze at a temperature at least about -25 째C (-13째F) with freezing definitely taking<br>
place at a temperature of at least about -29째C (-20째F).	In contrast, the product of<br>
the instant claimed invention, comprising about 50% weight percent glycerin and<br>
containing sodium chloride, has been found to not begin freezing until the temperature<br>
reaches at least about -35째C (about -31 째F), with freezing definitely taking place at a<br>
temperature of at least about -40째C (about -40째F).<br>
This freezing point can be further lowered by increasing the amount of water<br>
soluble salt, such as sodium chloride, to a level of about 10 weight percent or more in<br>
the product.<br>
Thus, the product may also be used even under harsh winter conditions as an<br>
anti-agglomerating and anti-adhesion agent, without encountering problems that result<br>
from freezing of the product. The product may be applied to the particulate material,<br>
or it may be directly applied to metal surfaces to prevent particulate adhesion by<br>
freezing, or it may be directly applied to surfaces such as conveyor belts (or airplane<br>
wings and cooling towers) to prevent ice build up even when particulate matter is not<br>
present.<br><br>
The product of this invention is available from Nalco Company, 1601 W.<br>
Diehl Road, Naperville, IL 60563, (630) 305-1423.<br>
The product may optionally be diluted with water to reduce the cost per square<br>
meter of surface being treated.. The amount of water dilution may vary with the<br>
conditions, and may be determined at the site of use, depending upon the nature of the<br>
particulate matter, be it dirt roads, coal piles, sand piles, or the like, and the<br>
temperature at the area. The typical dilution is from about 10 to about 400 or 500<br>
weight percent of water, based on the amount of the product present This diluted<br>
mixture may then be applied to a road, a pile of coal, such as coal in a railroad car or<br>
rolling hopper, a pile of sand, or the like, to reduce the propagation of dust. This<br>
product also will act to prevent particle agglomeration at low temperatures.<br>
It is typically preferred for the product of this invention to contain, as applied,<br>
from about 40 to about 60 weight percent of glycerin when its use is for freeze control,<br>
that is: prevention of agglomeration of material particles, including chunks, and<br>
prevention of their adhesion to particularly metal surfaces of railcars, conveyor belts<br>
and the like, even if the prevention of dust in the air is not a major factor.<br>
An "effective amount" is that amount of product sufficient to wet the surface of<br>
the particulate material and/or the other surfaces so as to substantially prevent freezing<br>
thereof at the temperature of use, and to suppress agglomeration of the particulate<br>
material and its adhesion to surfaces.<br>
As previously stated, the product is particularly useful at subfreezing<br>
temperatures, because it does not freeze until preferably at least about -35째C, or a<br>
lower temperature is reached. The product serves as a freeze control agent to prevent<br>
the agglomeration of particulate matter like coal, and the sticking thereof to<br><br>
particularly metal surfaces such as railroad cars or conveyor belts, by prevention of<br>
freezing of water present.<br>
The fourth aspect of the instant claimed invention is a method of preventing the<br>
generation of dust from particulate materials, which comprises: applying to said<br>
particulate material a product for dust control, which product comprises an effective<br>
mixture of glycerin, water, and a water soluble salt, in concentrations and in an amount<br>
sufficient to wet the surface of the particulate material and to substantially prevent the<br>
generation of dust from said particulate material.<br>
In one embodiment, a method of preventing the generation of dust from<br>
particulate materials comprises applying to said particulate material a product for dust<br>
control, wherein said product comprises a mixture of from about 45 to about 90 weight<br>
percent of glycerin, from about 5 to about 50 weight percent of water and from about 2<br>
to about 15 weight percent of a water soluble salt<br>
The product useful in the fourth aspect of the instant claimed invention is that<br>
product of either the first aspect of the instant claimed invention, or that product of the<br>
second aspect of the instant claimed invention.<br>
It has been found that the product of mis invention is highly effective for dust<br>
control, showing improvements in its own right over many other dust control agents at<br>
any temperature, to suppress me generation of dust in the surrounding air.<br>
When dust suppression is a major factor, it is generally preferred for me<br>
product of this invention to contain, as applied, on the order of from about 20 to 80<br>
weight percent of glycerin.<br><br>
The following examples, and the above disclosure, are presented to describe<br>
preferred embodiments and utilities of the invention, and are not meant to limit the<br>
invention, which is as stated in the claims appended hereto.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Example 1-Dust Control<br>
A crude, aqueous glycerin solution is obtained as a product from a biodiesel<br>
synthesis process using soybean oil or canola oil as a raw material, with methanol and<br>
sodium hydroxide as added reactants, under conventional, commercial conditions. The<br>
resulting, crude glycerin component is separated in a conventional manner, and<br>
neutralized with hydrochloric acid. In this embodiment, the resulting, crude glycerin<br>
solution comprises about 80 weight percent of glycerin, about 10 to about 11 weight<br>
percent of water, about 7 weight percent of sodium chloride, and about 1 to about 2<br>
weight percent of fatty acids and methyl esters thereof.<br>
This product is applied to a dirt road located in a sand and gravel processing<br>
facility, to act as a dust control material., The first application is applied as a mixture<br>
of about 70 weight percent of the above product and about 30 weight percent of added<br>
water. Four weeks later, a "maintenance dose", of a mixture of about 20 weight<br>
percent product and about 80 weight percent water, is applied to maintain the desired<br>
level of dust control. The level of dust control achieved is considered acceptable, and<br>
the customer places a large order for the product for use as a dust control agent on this<br>
dirt road.<br>
The product may be diluted with water to any degree that still provides the<br>
desired effect.<br>
Example 2-Freeze Control<br><br>
The operators of a power plant wish to not receive coal that is frozen together<br>
in agglomerated clumps, that are difficult to unload, and must be broken up prior to<br>
being used as fuel for the power plant boilers.<br>
The coal travels in open rail cars from the coal processing plant to the power<br>
plant, and during winter months under subfreezing temperatures it has been known for<br>
coal to arrive within a week to two weeks in a wet, frozen state, causing handling to be<br>
very difficult<br>
During the month of December, 2003, the , crude glycerin solution of Example<br>
1 was diluted with water, and applied to coal being loaded in open rail cars, using a<br>
spray nozzle that applies the crude glycerin solution as the coal comes off the conveyor<br>
belt and lands in the rail car. The solution, as applied, comprised from about 60 to<br>
about 65 weight percent of the, crude glycerin solution, and from about 35 to about 40<br>
weight percent of added water. A dosing level of from about two to about four pints of<br>
material as applied is used per ton of coal.<br>
The power plant immediately notices a lessening in their receipt of frozen-<br>
together, or "agglomerated", coal, and requests that throughout the winter months this<br>
material be applied on a regular basis.<br>
Similarly-treated coal does not adhere significantly to a metal conveyor belt as<br>
it is transported in subfreezing conditions. The conveyor belt may also be directly<br>
sprayed with the solution of Example 1, to suppress ice build-up.<br>
The above has been offered for illustrative purposes only, and is not intended to<br>
limit the scope of the invention of this application, which is as defined in the claims<br>
below.<br><br>

ABSTRACT<br><br>
METHOD FOR PREVENTING AGGLOMERATION OR GENERATION<br>
OF DUST FROM A PARTICULATE MATERIAL COMPRISING COAL<br>
A method of preventing the agglomeration of particulate material comprising coal<br>
and the adhesion thereof to surfaces in subfreezing temperatures, which<br>
comprises: a) providing a particulate material comprising coal; b) providing a<br>
concentrated product which comprises a mixture of from 45 to 90 weight percent<br>
of glycerin, from 5 to 50 weight percent of water, 0.5 to 3 weight percent of fatty<br>
acids and esters thereof and from 2 to 15 weight percent of water soluble salts<br>
wherein the freezing point of said concentrated product is at least -35째C; diluting<br>
the concentrated product with 10-400 weight percent of water, based on the<br>
amount of said concentrated product to form a diluted product; applying to the<br>
particulate material an effective amount of [[a]] the diluted product to suppress<br>
agglomeration of the particulate material and its adhesion to surfaces.</td>
