FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present disclosure relates to torque control in a vehicle, and more<br>
particularly to torque control arbitration in powertrain systems.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The statements in this section merely provide background information related to<br>
the present disclosure and may not constitute prior art.<br>
Vehicles typically include a powertrain system that generates drive torque and<br>
transfers the drive torque to driven wheels, which propel the vehicle along a<br>
surface. Powertrain systems come in various configurations and include various<br>
components. A traditional powertrain system includes a torque source, such as<br>
an internal combustion engine (ICE), a transmission that is coupled to the torque<br>
source and a driveline that is coupled to an output of the transmission. The<br>
driveline can be a front-wheel driveline (FWD), a rear-wheel driveline (RWD) or a<br>
four-wheel driveline (4WD), which typically also includes a transfer case. Some<br>
powertrain systems include multiple torque sources, such as is the case with a<br>
hybrid electric powertrain system, which includes an ICE and an electric<br>
motor/generator.<br>
Powertrain systems also include several torque features, each of which seeks to<br>
influence the amount of drive torque at various points along the powertrain<br>
system. An upper level or global torque feature is a vehicle driver, who<br>
commands a desired output torque from the torque source(s) or a desired axle<br>
torque based on a driver input. Exemplary driver inputs include, but are not<br><br>
limited to, an accelerator pedal and a cruise control system. Modern powertrain<br>
systems include additional torque features such as vehicle stability control<br>
systems, traction control systems, engine overspeed protection systems,<br>
transmission shift quality systems, engine and/or transmission component<br>
protection systems and/or driveline component protection systems, among<br>
several others. The torque features can number in the tens to over a hundred,<br>
depending upon the particular configuration of the powertrain system.<br>
The torque features of a particular powertrain system are independent and can<br>
often seek to control the drive torque at the same time. Because the powertrain<br>
system can only produce a single drive torque value at any time, an arbitration<br>
system is required to determine the correct drive torque to produce. Traditional<br>
powertrain systems are overly complex and seek to establish a hierarchy of<br>
desired torque behavior. Such traditional powertrain systems use one or two<br>
primary design methods. They either assign various priority levels to a torque<br>
request to enable arbitration based on priority or they rely on complex pre-<br>
defined interactions. Both of these methods result in complex systems and<br>
system behavior compromises.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, the present disclosure provides a method of regulating a torque<br>
output of a vehicle powertrain. The method includes generating a plurality of<br>
torque requests and associating each of the plurality of torque requests with one<br>
of a plurality of arbitration domains to form torque request sets associated with<br>
each of the plurality of arbitration domains. A first torque request set is<br>
arbitrated within a first of the plurality of arbitration domains to provide a first<br>
torque request. The first torque request is introduced into a second torque<br><br>
request set associated with a second of the plurality of arbitration domains. The<br>
second torque request set is arbitrated within the second arbitration domain to<br>
provide a second torque request. A torque source is regulated based on the<br>
second torque request.<br>
In another feature, the steps of arbitrating include identifying a lowest maximum<br>
torque request within an arbitration domain and identifying a highest minimum<br>
torque request within the arbitration domain. A torque request output for the<br>
arbitration domain is set equal to the lower of the lowest maximum torque<br>
request and the highest minimum torque request.<br>
In another feature, the step of introducing includes setting the first torque<br>
request equal to a minimum torque request.<br>
In another feature, the torque requests include at least one of an absolute<br>
torque, a minimum torque limit, a maximum torque limit and a torque delta.<br>
In still other features, the steps of arbitrating include identifying a lowest<br>
maximum torque request within an arbitration domain and identifying a highest<br>
minimum torque request within the arbitration domain. A torque request output<br>
for the arbitration domain is set equal to the lower of the lowest maximum<br>
torque request and the highest minimum torque request minus a torque delta<br>
request when the torque requests include torque delta requests. The torque<br>
delta request is a decreasing delta torque request and is the largest of all torque<br>
delta requests of the torque delta requests.<br>
In yet other features, the steps of arbitrating include identifying a lowest<br>
maximum torque request within an arbitration domain and identifying a highest<br><br>
minimum torque request within the arbitration domain. A torque request output<br>
for the arbitration domain is set equal to the lower of the highest minimum<br>
torque request and the lowest maximum torque request plus a torque delta<br>
request when the torque requests include torque delta requests. The torque<br>
delta request is the largest increasing torque delta request when the delta torque<br>
requests do not include a decreasing delta torque request.<br>
Further areas of applicability will become apparent from the description provided<br>
herein. It should be understood that the description and specific examples are<br>
intended for purposes of illustration only and are not intended to limit the scope<br>
of the present disclosure.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The following description of the preferred embodiment is merely exemplary in<br>
nature and is in no way intended to limit the disclosure, its application, or uses.<br>
For purposes of clarity, the same reference numbers will be used in the drawings<br>
to identify similar elements. As used herein, the term module refers to an<br>
application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), an electronic circuit, a processor<br>
(shared, dedicated, or group) and memory that execute one or more software or<br>
firmware programs, a combinational logic circuit, or other suitable components<br>
that provide the described functionality.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 1, an exemplary powertrain system 10 includes an internal<br>
combustion engine (ICE) 12 and an electric motor (EM) 14. The ICE 12 and EM<br>
14 are torque sources and can each generate torque to drive a transmission 16.<br>
Accordingly, the ICE and EM are considered to be torque sources. The<br>
transmission 16 multiplies the torque output of the ICE 12 and/or EM 14 to drive<br>
a driveline 18. The driveline 18 includes a propeller shaft 20, a differential 22 and<br>
axle shafts 24 (e.g., halfshafts). The torque that is output from the transmission<br>
16 is transferred through the propeller shaft 20, is multiplied by a final drive ratio<br>
in the differential 22 and is split between the axle shafts 24 to drive driven<br>
wheels 26.<br>
The powertrain system 10 further includes a control module 30 that regulates<br><br>
operation of the torque sources (e.g,, the ICE 12 and/or EM 14) based on the<br>
torque control arbitration of the present disclosure. A driver input 32 is provided<br>
and provides an input to the control module 30. The driver input 32 can include,<br>
but is not limited to, an accelerator pedal and/or a cruise control system.<br>
Although the exemplary powertrain system is described as a rear-wheel drive<br>
(RWD) hybrid electric powertrain, it is appreciated that the torque arbitration of<br>
the present disclosure can be implemented in any powertrain configuration. For<br>
example, the torque arbitration control can be implemented in a powertrain<br>
having a single torque source (e.g., an ICE or an EM) and having a front-wheel<br>
drive (FWD), RWD, four-wheel drive (4WD) or all-wheel drive (AWD)<br>
configuration. As another example, the torque control arbitration can be<br>
implemented in a hybrid electric vehicle having an ICE and a plurality of electric<br>
motors (e.g., an electric motor operably located at each driven wheel).<br>
The torque control arbitration of the present disclosure includes, but is not<br>
limited to, the following features: established torque arbitration domains,<br>
standard types of torque requests, validation and limitation of torque requests,<br>
arbitration of multiple torque requests within a domain, arbitration of torque<br>
requests when transitioning between domains, as well as accommodating delta<br>
torque requests. Each of these features is discussed in further detail below.<br>
For a given powertrain system, a plurality of torque arbitration domains is<br>
established. An arbitration domain is an area within the powertrain torque flow<br>
path that a torque feature or torque features desire to control the torque. The<br>
arbitration domains include a global arbitration domain and subsequent<br>
arbitration domains that step down to a torque source domain or multiple torque<br>
source domains. The global arbitration domain is defined as the outermost<br><br>
arbitration domain and the torque source domain(s) is(are) defined as the<br>
innermost arbitration domain(s). The number of arbitration domains depends on<br>
the particular configuration of the powertrain system. The inner domains<br>
continue to move in the powertrain system with an arbitration domain at each<br>
point that a torque feature desires to control the torque. Exemplary torque<br>
features are discussed in further detail below.<br>
Each torque feature generates a torque request, which include, but is not limited<br>
to, an absolute torque value, a minimum torque limit value, a maximum torque<br>
limit value or a delta torque value. The torque requests are sorted into the<br>
appropriate arbitration domain based on the point in the driveline that each<br>
desires to control a desired torque behavior. Sorting of the torque requests is<br>
discussed in further detail in commonly assigned GM Reference No. P000046, the<br>
disclosure of which is expressly incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The exemplary powertrain system 10 of FIG. 1 includes a driver domain (DD), an<br>
axle torque domain (AD), a propulsion domain (PD), an engine domain (ED) and<br>
an electric motor domain (EMD). The arbitration domains work from the outside<br>
of the powertrain system to the inside of the powertrain system. For example,<br>
the DD is the global arbitration domain (i.e., the outermost arbitration domain)<br>
and the ED and EMD are both torque source domains (i.e., the innermost<br>
arbitration domains). The DD encompasses torque features including, but not<br>
limited to, the driver torque input (e.g., accelerator pedal and/or cruise control),<br>
which generate an absolute torque request. For example, a driver depresses the<br>
accelerator pedal indicating a corresponding amount of torque desired from the<br>
torque sources.<br>
The AD is subsequent to the DD and includes the total output torque produced<br><br>
by the powertrain system at the axle shafts. An exemplary torque feature of the<br>
AD includes an axle protection torque feature, wherein an axle protection<br>
algorithm generates a maximum torque limit. The maximum torque limit<br>
indicates the maximum allowable torque through the axle in order to protect axle<br>
components (e.g., driveshafts, halfshafts).<br>
The PD is subsequent to the AD and includes the total torque output of the<br>
torque sources, which drives the transmission input shaft. An exemplary torque<br>
feature of the PD includes a transmission protection algorithm that generates a<br>
maximum torque limit to limit the torque at the transmission input shaft. The<br>
maximum torque limit indicates the maximum allowable torque through the<br>
transmission input shaft in order to protect transmission components.<br>
The ED and EMD are subsequent to the PD and include torque generated by the<br>
ICE and EM individually. An exemplary torque feature of the ED is an engine<br>
protection algorithm that generates a maximum torque limit to limit the torque<br>
generated by the engine. The maximum torque limit indicates the maximum<br>
allowable torque that is to be generated in order to protect engine components<br>
(e.g., piston rings, seals, valves and the like). Another exemplary torque feature<br>
of the ED is an engine stall prevention algorithm that generates a minimum<br>
torque limit. The minimum torque limit indicates the minimum amount of torque<br>
to be generated by the engine to prevent engine stall.<br>
Other exemplary torque features of the powertrain system 10 include, but are<br>
not limited to, a vehicle stability control system, a traction control system, an<br>
engine overspeed protection system and the like.<br>
All of the torque requests (TRs) generated by the torque features are confined to<br><br>
standard request types. The standard request types include an absolute torque<br>
value, a maximum torque limit, a minimum torque limit or a delta torque. In this<br>
manner, the overall powertrain system generates very few torque request types.<br>
Most powertrain systems can be managed with only the maximum and minimum<br>
torque limits, Each of the torque requests is validated as being good and is<br>
limited to the capabilities of the powertrain system prior to arbitration. For<br>
example, a validation algorithm processes a TR and determines whether the TR<br>
is valid based on, for example, the current operating characteristics of the<br>
powertrain system. The TR is compared to maximum and minimum values (i.e.,<br>
a range) and is limited based on these values. For example, if the TR is for 260<br>
Nm of engine torque output, but the engine is only capable of 250 Nm, the TR is<br>
limited to 250 Nm.<br>
Once all of the TRs have been validated and limited, the TRs are arbitrated<br>
within their respective domains. The arbitration starts with the outermost domain<br>
and works inward to the innermost domain(s). A simple rule set is implemented<br>
for arbitration within an arbitration domain. More specifically, the lowest<br>
maximum torque request (TMAXLO) and the highest minimum torque request<br>
(TMINHI) are identified. The TR value that is the output from the particular<br>
arbitration domain is the lower of TMAXLO and TMINHI-<br>
Once the single TR for an outer AD is determined, that TR is inserted into the TR<br>
set of the next inner domain and is arbitrated therewith. More specifically, when<br>
a transition is made from an outer to an inner domain, the outer domain TR is<br>
modified to be a minimum TR regardless of the request type that won arbitration<br>
in the outer domain. This is done at each transition between arbitration domains<br>
and enables a minimum TR in an inner domain to win arbitration over a<br>
maximum TR from an outer domain. When the powertrain splits along<br><br>
independent power flow paths, the arbitration splits into multiple arbitration<br>
paths, as discussed in further detail below.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 2, exemplary modules that execute a general arbitration<br>
for n arbitration domains (ADs) will be described. The AD modules include AD1<br>
to ADn. AD1 is the outermost AD (e.g., the DD) and ADn is the innermost or<br>
torque source AD. Each AD includes a plurality of TRs. For example, AD1<br>
includes TRADi,i to TRADi,m, AD2 includes TRAD2,i to TRAD3,P, AD3 includes TRAD3,i<br>
to TRAD3,q and ADn includes TRADn,i to TRADn,r. The torque control arbitration<br>
starts With AD1 and identifies the lowest maximum torque request and the<br>
highest minimum torque request from TRADI,I to TRADi,m- The TR output from<br>
AD1 (TRADI) is the lower of the lowest maximum torque request and the highest<br>
minimum torque request. TRADi is introduced into the TR set of AD2 and is set as<br>
a minimum TR (TRADI(MIN))- This arbitration process continues through to ADn.<br>
The arbitration within ADn outputs a final TR (TRADn), which a torque source<br>
regulation module uses to regulate the torque source.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 3, exemplary module that arbitrate torque requests for the<br>
powertrain system of FIG. 1 will be described in detail. The AD moduless include<br>
the DD, the AD, the PD, the ED and the EMD. The DD is the outermost AD and<br>
the ED and EMD are the innermost. The DD includes TRDD,i to TRDD,m, the AD<br>
includes TRAD,i to TRAD,P, the PD includes TRPD,i to TRPD,q, the ED includes TRED,I<br>
to TRED,r and the EMD includes TREMD,I to TREMD,S- The torque control arbitration<br>
starts with the DD and identifies the lowest maximum torque request and the<br>
highest minimum torque request from TRDD,I to TRDD,m- The lower of the lowest<br>
maximum torque request and the highest minimum torque request is output as<br>
TRDD.<br><br>
The torque control arbitration moves to the AD. More specifically, TRDD is set as<br>
a minimum torque request (TRDD(MIN)) and is arbitrated with the AD torque<br>
request set (TRAD,i to TRAD,P). The lowest maximum torque request and the<br>
highest minimum torque request are identified from TRAD,I to TRAD,P and<br>
TRDD(MIN). The lower of the lowest maximum torque request and the highest<br>
minimum torque request is output as TRAD. The torque control arbitration moves<br>
to the PD, where TRAD is set as a minimum torque request (TRADCMIN)) and is<br>
arbitrated with the PD torque request set (TRPD,i to TRPD,q). The lowest maximum<br>
torque request and the highest minimum torque request are identified from<br>
TRPD,I to TRPD,q and TRAD(MiN). The lower of the lowest maximum torque request<br>
and the highest minimum torque request is output as TRPD.<br>
Because there are multiple torque sources, TRPD is split based on the percentage<br>
of the total torque that is generated by each of the torque sources. More<br>
specifically, an optimization algorithm determines the percentage of the total<br>
torque that is to be generated by the ICE 12 and the EM 14 and the torque<br>
arbitration control generates corresponding arbitration values (TR'PD and TR'VD)<br>
based thereon. For example, if the optimization algorithm determines that the<br>
ICE 12 is to generate 100% of the torque, TR'PD is equal to TRPD and TR'VD is<br>
equal to zero. As another example, if the optimization algorithm determines that<br>
the ICE 12 is to generate 80% of the torque and the EM 14 is to generate 20%<br>
of the torque, TR'PD is equal to 0.80 x TRPD and TR'VD is equal to 0.20 x TRPD.<br>
TR'PD and TR'VD are set as minimum torque requests (TRPD'(MIN) and TR"PD(MIN),<br>
respectively) and are arbitrated with the ED and EMD torque request sets (TRED,i<br>
to TRED,r and TREMD,I to TREMD,s, respectively). The arbitration occurs as described<br>
above for the other ADs. The ED arbitration provides an ED torque request<br>
(TRED) and the EMD arbitration provides an EMD<br><br>
torque request (TREMD)- Operation of the ICE 12 is regulated by an ICE<br>
regulation module based on TRED and operation of the EM 14 is regulated by an<br>
EM regulation module based on TREMD-<br>
Referring now to FIG. 4, exemplary steps that are executed by the torque control<br>
arbitration will be described in detail. In step 400, control identifies the TRs in<br>
each arbitration domain. In step 402, control validates and limits each TR in each<br>
arbitration domain. Control sets i equal to 1 in step 404. In step 406, control<br>
arbitrates the TRs within ADi to provide a single torque request (TRADl) for ADi.<br>
In step 408, control determines whether i is equal to n. If i is equal to n, ADi is<br>
the arbitration domain associated with the torque source and control continues in<br>
step 410. If i is not equal to n, control continues in step 412. In step 410, control<br>
regulates operation of the torque source based on TRADS and control ends. In<br>
step 412, control sets TRADJ as a minimum TR, Control introduces TRADJ into the<br>
TR set of ADi+1 in step 414. In step 416, control increments i by 1 and<br>
continues in step 406.<br>
It is appreciated that the steps described above are exemplary and can be<br>
modified based on the configuration of a particular powertrain system. For<br>
example, the exemplary steps can be modified to account for the arbitration path<br>
splits associated with powertrain systems having multiple torque sources. It is<br>
further anticipated that the arbitration implementation as described herein<br>
provides on example of many for implementing the arbitration rules. The specific<br>
implementation can vary and is mechanized by arbitrating each request in<br>
sequence into a composite request in accordance with the arbitration rules. This<br>
is done, for example, instead of identifying the lowest maximum and the highest<br><br>
minimum and then choosing the lowest. This enables easier software<br>
mechanization with the same system behavior.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 5, exemplary steps executed by the torque control<br>
arbitration within an arbitration domain will be described in detail. In step 500,<br>
control determines TMAXLO for the TR set of the particular arbitration domain. In<br>
step 502, control determines TMINHI for the TR set of the particular arbitration<br>
domain. Control determines whether TMAXLO is greater than TMINHI in step 504. If<br>
TMAXLO is not greater than TMINHI, control continues in step 506. If TMAXLO is<br>
greater than TMINHI, control continues in step 508. In step 506, control forwards<br>
TMAXLO as TRAD and control ends. In step 508, control forwards TMINHI as TRAD and<br>
control ends.<br>
The torque control arbitration can also account for delta torque requests or<br>
torque offsets in powertrain systems that implement such torque features. An<br>
exemplary torque feature that generates a delta torque request includes a brake<br>
protection algorithm. The delta torque request indicates a fixed amount, by<br>
which the torque output is to be incremented or decremented. If a particular<br>
arbitration domain includes torque features that generate delta torque requests,<br>
the rules for that arbitration domain are as follows:<br>
1.	Determine TMAXLO-<br>
2.	Determine TMINHI-<br>
3. If there are decrementing delta torque request(s) in the arbitration domain,<br>
the forwarded TR is equal to the lower of the TMAXLO and TMINHI minus the<br>
largest decrementing delta torque request.<br><br>
4. If there is no decrementing delta torque request in the arbitration domain,<br>
the forwarded TR is equal to the lower of TMINHI and TMAXLO plus the largest<br>
increasing delta torque request.<br>
Those skilled in the art can now appreciate from the foregoing description that<br>
the broad teachings of the present disclosure can be implemented in a variety<br>
of forms. Therefore, whiie this disclosure has been described in connection with<br>
particular examples thereof, the true scope of the disclosure should not be so<br>
limited since other modifications will become apparent to the skilled practitioner<br>
upon a study of the drawings, the specification.<br><br>
