				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The invention relatet to in improvedprocess for producing pitch suitable for impregnating graphite electrodes  used in electric arc furnaces.<br>
The invention relates more particularly to  a process<br>
for producing pitch of   'quinoline insolubles’   (QI) content less<br>
than 2% by weight,  viscosity after ageing at 220°C for 72 hours<br>
in the range of 60-70 centipoise and softening point in the<br>
range of 50-70°C   (K &amp; D)-from coal tar obtained  in the high<br>
temperature carbonization of coaking coals into metallurgical<br>
cokes.    The pitch produced in the existing process from coal<br>
tar contains higher QI  of  7-1196 and  is of higher viscosity<br>
after ageing of above  140 centipoise,   and  is therefore found<br>
to be unsuitable  for impregnating graphite electrodes,   as  it<br>
does not impart the required-performance characteristics to<br>
the  electrodes,  such as low reactivity,  low porosity and low<br>
electrical resistivity;  has an appreciable surface tension at<br>
the impregnation temperature;  can not properly wet the surface<br>
of the  electrodes;   and does not yield a sufficiently high coke<br>
residue after graphitization of the electrodes.	<br>
The object of the present invention is  to providean improved process for producing pitch having reduced QI  content of less than 2%, viscosity after ageing in the range of 50-70 centipoise and softening point in the range of 50-70°C  (K &amp; S),  which is found to be suitable for impregnating graphite electrodes.<br>
The other object  is to provide  a process which  is capable of  producing value-added pitch.<br><br>
Yet another object is to provide a process of high cost effectiveness.<br>
The invented process comprises essentially the following steps  :-<br>
(a)	mixing dehydrated coal tar, produced in high<br>
temperature carbonization of coking coals into metallurgical<br>
coke and tar oils  containing heavy oils and creosote oil;<br>
(b)	heating the mixture to a temperature of 75-95°C;<br>
(c)	allowing settling and precipitation of the  'quinoline<br>
insolubles'   (QI)  at the bottom part of the mixture by retaining<br>
the mixture at the said temperature for a sufficiently long time;<br>
(d)	discarding the   'Q1  rich'   bottom part of the mixture;<br>
and<br>
(e)	distilling the   ' QI lean'   top part of the mixture to<br>
obtain the residue as the pitch suitable for impregnating<br>
graphite electrodes.<br>
Thus the invention provides an improved process for producing pitch for impregnating graphite electrodes used in electric arc furnaces,  which is capable of producing value-added pitch of low'quinoline insolubles'   (QI)  content i.e.  less than 2% by weight,  viscosity 60-70 centipoise at 220°C and softening point 50-70°C,   from the coal tar obtained in the high temperature carbonization of coaking coals into metallurgical  cokes,  and highly cost-effective,   characterised in that the process comprises the steps :<br>
(a)      heating the dehydrated coal tar and tar oils containing oils like creasote  oil in separate  containers to a temperature of 75-95°C;<br><br>
(b)	mixing thoroughly the heated tar and oils in another<br>
container in the  ratio of 40:60 to 60:40 by weight;<br>
(c)	transferring the mixture  into a reactor,   such as herein<br>
described,  through the feeding funnel and maintaining the<br>
temperature of the mixture at 70-90°C by adjusting the position<br>
of the burner with respect to the  reqctor bottom part;<br>
(d)	allowing settling and precipitation of QI at the bottom<br>
part of the  reactor at ambient temperature for a period of 12 to<br>
24 hours;<br>
(e)	discarding the   'QI rich'  lower portion of the mixture,<br>
constituting 25-35% of the total volume thereof through drain<br>
valve;<br>
(f)	transferring the remaining portion of the mixture to a<br>
conventional coal  tar distillation plant;<br>
(g)	distilling the mixture at a temperature  of 330-360°C<br>
the residue<br>
to obtain the residueas the pitch for impregnating graphite electrodes.<br>
The  invention is described fully and particularly by way of example only,  without restricting its scope in any manner,   with reference to  the accompanying drawings in which -<br>
Figure 1  shows the sketch of a prototype reactor designed and constructed for performing various experiments for optimising the critical parameters of the invented process.<br><br>
With reference to Fig. 1, the reactor comprises a jacketed vessel (1) having a water feeding line (2) and a water draining line (3) to the jacketed part (4) containing water (5). A feeding funnel (6) is provided at the top of the reactor for feeding a preheated mixture of dehydrated coal tar and tar oils into the reactor. A drain valve (7) is provided at the bottom<br>
c<br>
of the reactor for draining out the QI rich part of the mixture at the end of a specified period of settling and precipitation of QI in the reactor.  A burner (8) is externally mounted to heat the reactor with a view to maintaining the temperature the mixture (9) therein at a specified level by compensating for the loss of heat from the reactor, but without disturbing the mixture during the settling and precipitation of the QI therein. A thermometer (10) is introduced into the mixture to record the temperature thereof. The position of the bufner with respect to the bottom part (11) of the reactor, which is conical, is adjustable for controlling the temperature of the mixture. The upper part (12) of the reactor is cylindrical having the ratio of height to internal diameter of 1.2. The ratio of the height of the cylindrical upper part to the maximum depth of the conical bottom part is 3.4.<br>
Detailed experiments were performed using the reactor (Fig. 1) for optimising the following three critical parameters of the process :-<br>
(i) Ratio (w/w) of the dehydrated coal tar to tar oils in the mixture;<br><br>
(ii)    Temperature of the mixture,  to be maintained during settling and precipitation of QI;  and<br>
(iii)    Time to be  allowed for settling and  precipitation of QI.<br>
A typical example of the experiments  performed  is described below  :<br>
5 kg of dehydrated coal tar and 5 kg  of tar oils are heated separately in two buckets to a temperature of 85°C, transferred to  and  mixed together in a third bucket,  by stirring the mixture to attain a temperature of 80°C.    The mixture is then fed into the reactor through feeding funnel   (6).    The burner  (e) is   positioned  suitably to maintain the temperature of the mixture   (9)  in the  reactor at 80°C.    After allowing 16 hours for settling and  precipitation of QI  at the bottom part   (11) of the  reactor,  the QI rich lower portion of the mixture,  constituting about 3096 of the total volume,  collected<br>
^<br>
at the bottom part,  is drained out through valve   (7) and the QI lean upper portion of the mixture,  constituting about 70% of the total volume,   is subjected to distillation in a known distillation column at a temperature upto 340-350°C.    The residue left on completion of the distillation is  the pitch which contains less than 2% QI,   is of viscosity after ageing at 220°C for 72 houwsin the range of 60-70 centipoise  and of softening point 50-70°C   (K &amp; S),   and   is  found suitable for impregnating graphite electrodes.<br>
Typical  results  of the  experiments   performed   are presented  in Tables  1  to 3.<br><br>
Table 1 illustrates the effect of lowering the ratio of coal tar to tar oils in the mixture on the QI content of the<br>
QI lean portion of the mixture after allowing A hours for settling and precipitation thereof. It is noted that the reduction in QI content in the QI lean portion of the mixture is more pronounced at a lower ratio i.e. 30:70 of coal tar to tar oils in the mixture.<br>
But because of the operational problems arising from a rapid vapourization of tar oils during the subsequent distillation of the QI lean portion of the mixture if the ratio of coal tar to tar oils is made much below 50:50, the said ratio is optimised at 50:50.<br>
The effect of temperature of the mixture of coal tar and tar oils in the reactor on the reduction of QI content in the QI lean portion of the mixture is shown in Table 2 from -which it is noted that QI reduction is greater at a higher temperature.<br>
Table 3 shows the effect of the time allowed for settling and precipitation of QI in the reactor.  It is noted that the reduction of QI content in the QI lean portion of the mixture is greater at a longer time of settling and precipitation.<br>
The conventional coal tar distillation plant for producing pitch of a relatively high QI content can be used after minor modifications thereof for an industrial scale production of Ditch in the invented process.<br><br>
Since  the pitch of low QI  content, viscosity and softening point,   suitable for impregnating graphite  electrodes, is   an appreciably high value-added product and since the existing distillation plant for coal tar can be used at a<br>
marginal investfment for modifications,  the invention provides a highly cost effective process for producing pitch of impregnating characteristics.<br>
