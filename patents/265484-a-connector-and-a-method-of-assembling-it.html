				<td>The present invention relates to a connector and toamethod of assembling it.<br>
Generally, a female connector is provided with a housing formed with cavities into which female terminal fittings are insertable, and a locking portion for retaining the female terminal fitting is formed at one side surface of each cavity of the housing. The female terminal fitting is retained by this locking portion and connected with a tab of a male terminal fitting inserted through a front opening of the cavity in this state.<br>
Mold-removal holes are left in the front surface of the housing as the locking portions are formed. If the male and female connectors are not properly positioned relative to each other upon being connected, the leading ends of the tabs may be erroneously inserted into the mold-removal holes. Particularly with a tendency of recent years to miniaturize connectors, tabs become more likely to be erroneously inserted. There is a demand for a countermeasure against this.<br>
The present invention was developed in view of the above problem and an object thereof is to avoid the erroneous insertion of a tab.<br>
25.01.2006 14.51 - S7959EU.2<br>
This object is solved according to the invention by the features of the independent claims. Preferred embodiments of the invention are subject of the dependent claims.<br>
According to the invention, there is provided a connector in which at least one cavity into which a terminal fitting is at least partly insertable is formed in a housing,<br>
a locking portion engageable with the terminal fitting to lock the terminal fitting is formed at an inner wall of the cavity, and<br>
a mating tab can be at least partly inserted into the cavity from front, thereby being connected with the terminal fitting at least partly inserted in the cavity,<br>
wherein a front wall member in the form of a substantially flat plate having at least one tab insertion hole that can communicate with the cavity is mountable on or to the front surface of the housing.<br>
Since the front wall member is mounted or mountable on or to the front surface of the housing and the mating tab is at least partly inserted into the cavity of the housing through the tab insertion hole of the front wall member as the connectors are connected, a situation where the leading end of the tab is erroneously inserted into the mold-removal hole can be avoided.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, a mold-removal hole is so formed in the housing before the locking portion as to make an opening in the front surface of the housing as the locking portion is formed.<br>
According to a further preferred embodiment of the invention, there is provided a connector in which a cavity into which a terminal fitting is insertable<br>
is formed in a housing, a locking portion engageable with the terminal fitting to lock the terminal fitting is formed at an inner wall of the cavity, a mold-removal hole is so formed in the housing before the locking portion as to make an opening in the front surface of the housing as the locking portion is formed, and a mating tab is inserted into the cavity from front, thereby being connected with the terminal fitting inserted in the cavity, characterized in that a front wall member in the form of a flat plate having a tab insertion hole that can communicate with the cavity is mounted on the front surface of the housing.<br>
Since the front wall member is mounted on the front surface of the housing and the mating tab is inserted into the cavity of the housing through the tab insertion hole of the front wall member as the connectors are connected, a situation where the leading end of the tab is erroneously inserted into the mold-removal hole can be avoided even though the mold-removal hole is open in the front surface of the housing.<br>
Preferably, the terminal fitting includes<br>
a main portion into which the tab is at least partly insertable,<br>
a resilient contact piece that can be brought into contact with the tab being at least partly arranged in the main portion and<br>
a detecting portion for electrical connection test being set at a position of the main portion different from the resilient contact piece .<br>
Further preferably, the front wall member is formed with at least one jig insertion hole for permitting the at least partial insertion of an unlocking jig for disengaging the locking portion from the terminal fitting from front.<br>
Still further preferably, the front wall member is movably held on the housing between a second position where the tab insertion hole substantially communicates with the cavity and preferably the jig insertion hole substantially communicates with the mold-removal hole, and a first position where the detecting portion substantially faces the jig insertion hole.<br>
Further preferably, with the terminal fitting substantially properly inserted in the cavity, the tab can at least partly enter the main portion through the tab insertion hole to come into contact with a resilient contact piece of the terminal fitting, and an unlocking jig can be at least partly inserted into the mold-removal hole through the jig insertion hole to come into contact with the locking portion and to resiliency displace the locking portionin unlocking direction when the front wall member is at a second position.<br>
Still further preferably, a jig for electrical connection test can be at least partly inserted into the jig insertion hole from front to come into contact with the detecting portion when the front wall member is at the partial locking position.<br>
Most preferably, the terminal fitting includes a main portion into which the tab is insertable, a resilient contact piece that can be brought into contact with the tab being arranged in the main portion and a detecting portion for electrical connection test being set at a position of the main portion different from the resilient contact piece,<br>
the front wall member is formed with a jig insertion hole for permitting the insertion of an unlocking jig for disengaging the locking portion from the terminal fitting from front,<br>
the front wall member is movably held on the housing between a full locking position where the tab insertion hole communicates with the cavity and the jig insertion hole communicates with the mold-removal hole and a partial locking position where the detecting portion faces the jig insertion hole, and<br>
with the terminal fitting inserted in the cavity, the tab can enter the main portion through the tab insertion hole to come into contact with the resilient contact piece and the unlocking jig can be inserted into the mold-removal hole through the jig insertion hole to come into contact with the locking portion and to resiliency displace the locking portion in unlocking direction when the front wall member is at the full locking position, whereas a jig for electrical connection test can be inserted into the jig insertion hole from front to come into contact with the detecting portion when the front wall member is at the partial locking position.<br>
Generally, a terminal fitting to be accommodated in a cavity of a female connector includes a box portion having a tab insertion opening in the front surface thereof and a barrel portion arranged behind the box portion to be crimped into connection with an end of a wire, wherein a resilient tongue piece folded backward from the front end of the box portion is formed in the box portion.<br>
When the female connector is properly connected with a mating male connector, a tab of the male terminal fitting enters the box portion through the tab insertion opening and comes into resilient contact with the resilient tongue piece to establish an electrical connection therebetween (see e.g. Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. H05-182712).<br>
There is a method for conducting an electrical connection test for the female connector by inserting an electrically conductive probe through the tab insertion opening of the female terminal fitting to directly come into contact with the resilient tongue piece of the female terminal fitting. However, according to such a method, there is a possibility that the resilient tongue piece is set in permanent or plastically deformed since the resilient tongue piece is resiliency deformed as the electrically conductive probe comes into contact.<br>
In the present preferred embodiment of the invention, the jig for electrical connection test can be inserted through the jig insertion hole to come into contact with the detecting portion set at the position different from the resilient contact piece in the main portion of the terminal fitting when the front wall member is held at the partial locking position on the housing. Thus, the electrical connection test can be conducted without touching the resilient contact piece, thereby preventing the deformation of the resilient contact piece and the like at the time of the electrical connection test.<br>
Further, since the jig insertion hole of the front wall member functions as a hole for permitting the passage of the unlocking jig when the front wall member is at the full locking position while functioning as a hole for permitting the passage of the jig for electrical connection test when the front wall member is at the partial locking position, it is not necessary to separately form both holes in the front wall member, leading to the simplification and miniaturization of the construction of the front wall member.<br>
According to still a further preferred embodiment of the invention, when the front wall member is at a first position or partial locking position, a front<br>
opening of the main portion and the tab insertion hole are displaced from each other, and the leading end of the jig for electrical connection test does not enter the main portion if the jig for electrical connection test is at least partly inserted into the tab insertion hole from front.<br>
The front opening of the main portion and the tab insertion opening of the front wall member are displaced from each other when the front wall member is at the first position or partial locking position, and the jig for electrical connection test does not enter the main portion even if this jig is erroneously inserted into the tab insertion opening. Thus, the contact of the jig and the resilient contact piece can be securely avoided.<br>
Preferably, the main portion is formed with a detecting plate for at least partly covering the front opening of the main portion except an area where the tab passes, and the detecting portion is set on the front surface of the detecting plate.<br>
Since the main portion of the terminal fitting is formed with the detecting plate for at least partly covering the opening of the main portion except the area where the tab passes and the detecting portion is set on the front surface of the detecting plate, a large contact area of the jig for electrical connection test and the detecting portion can be ensured to increase the reliability of the electrical connection test.<br>
Further preferably, the front wall member is formed to be integral or unitary to the housing via at least one hinge.<br>
As described above, it is preferable for the connector to provide the front wall member, but this leads to a problem of increasing the number of parts. Thus, there is a demand for a further improvement.<br>
In the present preferred embodiment of the invention, since the front wall member is formed to be integral or unitary to the housing via the hinge, it is not necessary to separately form the front wall member and the housing, thereby reducing the number of parts.<br>
Still further preferably, the front wall member is supported rotatably or pivotably about the hinge and is mounted on the front surface of the housing when being rotated or pivoted substantially in closing direction to reach a rotation ending position.<br>
When the front wall member is rotated or pivoted about the hinge to reach the rotation or pivoting ending position, the front wall member can be mounted on the front surface of the housing through one movement, thereby improving mounting operability.<br>
Further preferably, a retainer mount hole into which a retainer for retaining the terminal fitting is at least partly mountable is formed in a side surface of the housing,<br>
a position of the front wall member reached by rotating the front wall member by about 90° in opening direction from the rotation ending position is an initial position, and<br>
the tab insertion hole and the retainer mount hole are open in the substantially same direction when the front wall member is at the initial position.<br>
The position of the front wall member reached by rotating or pivoting the front wall member by about 90° in opening direction from the rotation ending position is the initial position, and the tab insertion hole and the retainer mount hole are open in the same direction when the front wall member is at the initial position. Thus, the tab insertion hole can be simultaneously formed using a mold for forming the retainer mount hole by setting the posture of the housing such that the front wall member is substantially at the initial position upon molding the housing. Therefore, the mold can be simplified.<br>
Still further preferably, a mounting frame for at least partly covering the side edges of the front wall member when the front wall member is at least partly fitted thereinto is mounted on the front surface of the housing.<br>
Since the side edges of the front wall member are protected by being covered by the mounting frame, a situation where the front wall member is inadvertently detached from the front surface of the housing due to the intrusion of an external matter from the outside can be avoided.<br>
Most preferably, at least one part of a surface of the front wall member substantially facing the housing provided at least partly around the tab insertion hole can function as a front stop wall for the terminal fitting when the terminal fitting is being inserted into the cavity.<br>
According to the invention, there is further provided a method of assembling or mounting or forming a connector, in particular according to the invention or a preferred embodiment thereof, comprising the following steps:<br>
providing at least one cavity in a housing<br>
at least partly inserting at least one terminal fitting into the cavity, and<br>
engaging a locking portion formed at an inner wall of the cavity with the terminal fitting to lock the terminal fitting, and<br>
mounting a front wall member in the form of a substantially flat plate on or to the front surface of the housing, wherein front wall member has at least one tab insertion hole that can communicate with the cavity through which a mating tab can be at least partly inserted into the cavity from front, thereby being connected with the terminal fitting.<br>

A first preferred embodiment of the present invention is described with reference to FIGS. 1 to 15. A connector of this embodiment is provided with a female connector housing (hereinafter, ,,female housing 10") connectable with a male connector housing (not shown), and a front wall member 50 is to be mounted on or to the front surface of the female housing 10. In the following description, a side to be connected with the male connector housing is referred to as front side.<br>
The female housing 10 is made e.g. of a synthetic resin substantially into a block preferably having a laterally long cross section. As shown in FIG. 8, the female housing 10 is internally formed with one or more, preferably a plurality of cavities 11 at one or more stages, preferably at each of two (upper and lower) stages, the cavities penetrating the female housing 10 substantially in forward and backward directions FED. One or more female terminal fittings 40 can be at least partly accommodated into the cavities 11 from an inserting side, preferably substantially from behind, and one or more front openings of the cavities 11 permit the passage of one or more tabs 70 of one or more respective male terminal fittings at least partly accommodated in the male connector housing.<br>
Each female terminal fitting 40 is, as shown in FIG. 5, an integral or unitary assembly of a main portion 41, a wire connection portion (preferably comprising a wire barrel 42 and/or an insulation barrel 43) located behind the main portion 41 to be connected (preferably crimped or bent or folded into connection) with a wire W. The main portion 41 preferably is formed substantially into a box (preferably substantially having a rectangular or<br>
polygonal cross section) by bending, folding and/or shaping an electrically conductive (preferably metal) sheet in width direction, and includes a ceiling or top plate 41 A, a bottom or base plate 41B and one or more, preferably a pair of lateral (left and right) side plates 41E as shown in FIG. 3. A stabilizer 44 projects outward or upward from one of the lateral (left and right) side plates 41 E. The stabilizer 44 can be held substantially in sliding contact with an escaping groove (not shown) formed in the cavity 11, preferably substantially along one corner of the upper surface of each cavity 11, and functions to prevent an improper (e.g. upside-down) insertion of the female terminal fitting<br>
40	because of an unmatched positional relationship of the stabilizer 44 and the<br>
escaping groove when the female terminal fitting 40 is inserted improperly<br>
oriented (e.g. upside down).<br>
A (preferably substantially cantilever-shaped) resilient contact piece 45 folded or bent backward at or close to the front edge of one of the plates<br>
41	A,41B or 41E of the main portion 41, preferably of the ceiling or top plate<br>
41 A, is arranged at or at least partly in the main portion 41. The resilient contact<br>
piece 45 has an angled side view and is resiliency deformable substantially<br>
upward and downward or in a direction intersecting an inserting direction of the<br>
mating tab 70 into the main portion 41. A contact point 45A with the mating tab<br>
70 preferably projects at the tip of the resilient contact piece 45 to resiliency<br>
squeeze or contact the tab 70 in cooperation with the bottom plate 41 B,<br>
preferably with a receiving portion 41F that is an inward projection (or recess<br>
formed by embossing) formed at or in the bottom plate 41 B.<br>
The resilient contact piece 45 has the base end thereof connected with the front edge of the ceiling plate 41A at a position preferably deviated to one side (to left in FIG. 3) from the widthwise center of this front edge, and slants therefrom toward the other side as it extends backward. Part of a front opening of the main portion 41 at a position (substantially corresponding to a position immediately above the base end of the resilient contact piece 45) toward one side from the widthwise center serves as a tab insertion opening 41G, whereas the remaining opening toward the other side is at least partly, preferably substantially fully closed by a detecting plate 46. The detecting plate 46 preferably substantially has a vertically long rectangular front view, and is formed by bending a forward projecting portion of the lateral (right) side plate 41E shown in FIG. 3 inwardly at an angle different from 0° or 180°, preferably substantially at right angle. When the female terminal fitting 40 is viewed from front, the base end of the resilient contact piece 45 is located adjacent to the detecting plate 46.<br>
As shown in FIG. 5, a locking portion 12 is integrally or unitarily formed at the lateral (upper) surface of each cavity 11 of the female housing 10. The locking portion 12 preferably cantilevers substantially forward (or substantially along the forward and backward directions FBD) with its portion connected with the lateral (upper) surface of the cavity 11 as a base end and is resiliency deformable substantially upward and downward or in a direction intersecting a mounting direction of the terminal fitting 40 into the cavity 11 or the forward and backward directions FBD. A locking projection 12A projecting substantially toward the cavity 11 is formed at the free end of the locking portion 12. A<br>
deformation space 13 is defined above the locking portion 12. At least one mold-removal hole 14 left in the front surface of the female housing 10 as the locking portion 12 is formed is present before the locking portion 12 including the deformation space 13, and substantially communicates with the cavity 11. The locking portion 12 comes to interfere with the female terminal fitting 40 during the insertion of the female terminal fitting 40 into the cavity 11, thereby being pushed or deformed substantially outward or up toward the deformation space 13. When the female terminal fitting 40 is substantially properly inserted, the locking portion 12 is resiliency at least partly restored to engage the locking projection 12A with a locking hole 47 formed in one of the lateral plates 41 A,41B, 41E, preferably in the ceiling plate 41 A, thereby retaining the female terminal fitting 40.<br>
A lock arm 15 is formed at an intermediate position, preferably substantially at the widthwise center, of the lateral (upper) surface of the female housing 10. The lock arm 15 preferably cantilevers substantially backward (or along the forward and backward directions FED) with the base end thereof supported on the front end of the lateral (upper) surface of the female housing 10, and an operable portion 15A is provided at or close to the free end thereof. A lock projection 15B is formed at an intermediate position (preferably a substantially longitudinal middle position) of the outer or upper surface of the lock arm 15. The lock projection 15B is or can be resiliency engaged with the male connector housing as the lock arm 15 is resiliency deformed, thereby inseparably holding the two housings connected.<br>
The lock arm 15 preferably has the lower surface thereof chamfered in an area preferably substantially behind the substantially longitudinal middle position, thereby forming a slanted surface 15E. A rear area of the upper surface of the female housing 10 substantially facing this slanted surface 15E preferably is slightly lowered as compared to a front area, so that a sufficient deformation space for the lock arm 15 can be ensured between the rear area of the lock arm 15 and the rear area of the lateral (upper) surface of the female housing 10. Inside the front area of the upper surface of the female housing 10 are formed the deformation spaces 13 for the locking portions 12, whereby the height of the female housing 10 is reduced as a whole.<br>
Preferably, a turning preventing wall 16 at least partly surrounding the operable portion 15A of the lock arm 15 stands on the lateral (upper) surface of the female housing 10. The turning preventing wall 16 preferably is substantially gate-shaped as a whole by a pair of leg portions 16A connected with the opposite ends of the lateral (upper) surface of the female housing 10 and a ceiling or top portion 16B spanning between the leg portions 16A, and the operable portion 15A is arranged at least partly inside the turning preventing wall 16. Such a turning preventing wall 16 can prevent the lock arm 15 from being turned up when the lock arm 15 gets caught by an external matter such as by a looped wire W from behind. As shown in FIG. 9, the ceiling portion 16B of the turning preventing wall 16 is notched or recessed to form a finger or operating hole 16E enabling the operable portion 15 to be operated e.g. a finger to push the operable portion 15A.<br>
As shown in FIG. 10, a retainer mount hole 17 used to mount a retainer 90 is formed in the lateral (bottom) surface of the female housing 10. The retainer mount hole 17 is formed in one or more, preferably in three surfaces of the female housing 10 to preferably extend from the bottom surface to the opposite side surfaces, wherefore the retainer mount hole 17 preferably is substantially open at three sides. The retainer mount hole 17 has such a depth as to substantially communicate or at least partly intersect with the respective cavities 11, thereby dividing the cavities 11 at the one or more stages, preferably at the upper and lower stages, into front and rear parts. The rear edges of the retainer mount hole 17 in the substantially opposite side surfaces of the female housing 10 are inclined edges 17 inclined up toward the front. One or more oblique finger placing projections 18 substantially continuous with the inclined edges 17A are formed at or close to the rear end of the bottom surface of the female housing 10.<br>
One or more guide ribs 19 are arranged substantially in parallel with the inclined edges 17A on the substantially opposite side surfaces of the female housing 10 while at least partly covering the openings of the retainer mount hole 17. Each guide rib 19 is in the form of an elongated plate or projection and preferably has one end at the shorter side connected with the front upper end of the opening of the retainer mount hole 17 and/or has the other end at the shorter side connected with a restricting wall 21. The restricting wall 21 substantially horizontally spans between the other end of the guide rib 19 and the front bottom end of the inclined edge 17A. A guide hole 22 into which a corresponding engaging projection 91 (to be described later) of the retainer 90<br>
is at least partly fittable is defined between the guide rib 19 and the inclined edge 17A, and the engaging projection 91 of the retainer 90 can be held substantially in sliding contact with this guide hole 22. The retainer 90 is prevented from coming off outward or downward by the contact of the engaging projections 91 of the retainer 90 with the upper edges of the restricting walls 21. One or more locking projections 24 extend substantially in forward and backward directions FBD on recessed surfaces 23 slightly retracted from peripheral areas of the opposite side surfaces of the female housing 10 before or close to the retainer mount hole 17.<br>
The retainer 90 is made e.g. of a synthetic resin similar to the female housing 10, and includes a retainer main body 92 at least partly fittable into the retainer mount hole 17 and supporting plate 93 bulging out substantially forward from the bottom end of the retainer main body 92.<br>
The retainer main body 92 preferably is formed with as many window frames 94 as the cavities 11 at each stage of the female housing 10. The respective window frames 94 are formed to be substantially alignable with the cavities 11 at the lower stage of the female housing 10, the front opening edges of the respective window frames 94 preferably are substantially vertical so as to substantially conform or correspond to the rear opening edges of the front parts of the respective cavities 11 divided into the front and rear parts by the retainer mount hole 17, and the rear opening edges thereof are formed to have an inclination substantially in conformity with or corresponding to the inclination of the front opening edges of the rear parts of the divided cavities 11.<br>
The retainer 90 is movable between a partial locking position (first position) and a full locking position (second position). When the retainer 90 is at the partial locking position (first position), the lower and upper surfaces of the respective window frames 94 are substantially at the substantially same heights as the bottom surfaces of the corresponding cavities 11 to permit the at least partial insertion and withdrawal of the female terminal fittings 40. On the other hand, if the retainer 90 is moved to the full locking position (second position), end surfaces (preferably lower front end surfaces and/or upper front end surfaces) of the respective window frames 94 come to be substantially opposed to portions (preferably the rear edges) of the main portions 41 of the female terminal fittings 40 to (preferably doubly) lock the female terminal fittings 40 preferably in cooperation with the locking portions 12. The engaging projections 91 are formed substantially along the inclination of the rear surfaces of the respective window frames 94 on the substantially opposite side surfaces of the retainer main body 92.<br>
The supporting plate 93 of the retainer 90 is so dimensioned as to at least partly, preferably substantially fully close the opening of the retainer mount hole 17 in the lateral (bottom) surface of the female housing 10 when the retainer 90 is at the full locking position (second position). One or more, preferably a pair of standing plates 95 project, preferably substantially vertically stand, from the opposite ends or end portions of the supporting plate 93. Both standing plates 95 are so spaced apart as to be capable of holding the female housing 10 between the recessed surfaces 23 of the substantially opposite side surfaces, and are deformable substantially inward and outward to change a<br>
spacing therebetween. The rear edges of the standing plates 95 are so arranged as to extend substantially along the front edges of the guide ribs 19 of the female housing 10, and the guide ribs 19 are held between the standing plates 95 and the engaging projections 91. Engaging projections 96 are so formed on the inner surfaces of the upper ends of the standing plates 95 as to substantially face each other.<br>
When the retainer 90 is at the partial locking position (first position), the engaging projections 96 of the retainer 90 are substantially in contact with the lower surfaces of the locking projections 24 of the female housing 10, thereby preventing any further oblique upward movement of the retainer 90, and the engaging projections 91 are substantially in contact with the upper edges of the restricting walls 21 to prevent the retainer 90 from coming off. In the process of moving the retainer 90 to the full locking position (second position), the engaging projections 96 move onto the locking projections 24 while the standing plates 95 are deformed to widen the spacing therebetween. When the retainer 90 substantially reaches the full locking position (second position), the standing plates 95 are at least partly restored towards or to their initial postures to engage the engaging projections 96 with the upper surfaces of the locking projections 24, whereby the retainer 90 is held at the full locking position (second position).<br>
As shown in FIG. 8, a mounting frame 27 substantially gate-shaped by opposite side walls 25 and an upper wall 26 is formed on the front surface of the female housing 10. The front wall member 50 is made e.g. of a synthetic resin into a substantially flat plate, and is at least partly fitted into the mounting<br>
frame 27 along the front surface of the female housing 10 in a mounting direction MD, preferably substantially laterally or from below.<br>
As shown in FIG. 11, the front wall member 50 is formed with one or more tab insertion holes 51 (preferably as many tab insertion holes 51 as the respective cavities 11), wherein the tab insertion holes 51 can substantially communicate with the corresponding cavities 11 and are arranged along width direction at one or more stages, preferably at two (upper and lower) stages. The tab insertion holes 51 preferably are dimensioned such that they can be held in sliding contact with the tabs 70 during the at least partial insertion of the tabs 70 in order to guide the tabs 70 to the corresponding cavities 11. The front wall member 50 is also formed with one or more jig insertion holes 52 that can substantially communicate with the mold-removal holes 14 left as the locking portions 12 are formed. The jig insertion holes 52 are arranged at one or more stages, preferably at two (upper and lower) stages and have an offset positional relationship (preferably substantially along the mounting direction MD) with the respective tab insertion holes 51. The jig insertion hole 52 at one end (left end in FIG. 11) of the upper stage makes an opening in the upper end of the front wall member 50.<br>
As shown in FIG. 12, one or more, preferably a plurality of ribs 53 substantially extending vertically or along the mounting direction MD that can be connected with or substantially contacted to partition walls 28 partitioning the cavities 11 in the female housing 10 are formed substantially side by side on the rear surface of the front wall member 50. A base portion 54 bulges out backward from the bottom end (rear end as seen in the mounting direction MD)<br><br>
of the rear surface of the front wall member 50, and the base ends of the vertical ribs 53 are coupled to the upper or inner surface of this base portion 54.<br>
One or more, preferably a pair of first latching portions 55 are formed at the opposite side edges of the front wall member 50 preferably at the substantially same height, and one or more, preferably a pair of second latching portions 56 are formed above and at a specified (predetermined or predeterminable) distance to the first latching portions 55. The first and second latching portions 55, 56 preferably have an identical shape and/or an identical size, wherein the upper surfaces thereof are slanted surfaces 57 inclined downward toward the projecting ends and the lower surfaces thereof are slanted surfaces 58 inclined upward toward the projecting ends.<br>
On the other hand, as shown in FIG. 10, one or more, preferably a pair of first receiving portions 31 are formed on the (preferably substantially opposite) side wall(s) 25 of the mounting frame 27 preferably at the substantially same height, and one or more, preferably a pair of second receiving portions 32 are formed preferably at the substantially same height above and at a specified (predetermined or predeterminable) distance from the first receiving portions 31. The first and second receiving portions 31, 32 preferably are such rectangular holes of an identical shape and/or an identical size that penetrate the side walls 25 in thickness direction and can at least partly receive the respective first and second latching portions 55, 56. Front parts of the first and second receiving portions 31, 32 are partitioned by disengagement preventing walls 33 formed by thinning the outer surfaces of the side walls 25, lest the mounted front wall member 50 should come off forward.<br>
The front wall member 50 is held or positioned at the partial locking position (as a preferred first position) 1P by resiliency fitting the second latching portions 56 into the first receiving portions 31 as shown in FIG. 2 while being held or positioned at the full locking position (as a preferred second position) 2P by resiliency fitting the second latching portions 56 into the second receiving portions 32 and the first latching portions 55 into the first receiving portions 31 as shown in FIG. 1. As a result, the front wall member 50 is movable substantially upward and downward or along the mounting direction MD (directions at an angle different from 0° or 180°, preferably substantially normal to a connecting direction of the two housings and/or to the forward and backward directions FBD) between the partial locking position 1P (first position) and the full locking position 2P (second position). In the process of moving the front wall member 50 from the partial locking position 1P (first position) to the full locking position 2P (second position), the second latching portions 56 preferably move over partition walls 34 between the first and second receiving portions 31, 32 while resiliency pushing the partial walls 34 outward and the first latching portions 55 move over end walls 35 located below the first receiving portions 31 while pushing the end walls 35 outward. In this case, the first and second latching portions 55, 56 can smoothly move over the partition walls 34 and the end walls 35 by bringing the slanted surfaces 57 as the upper surfaces of the first and second latching portions 55, 56 substantially into sliding contact with the lower surfaces of the partition walls 34 and the end walls 35. Likewise, in the process of moving the front wall member 50 from the full locking position 2P (second position) to the partial locking position 1P (first position), the first<br>
and second latching portions 55, 56 preferably can smoothly move over the partition walls 34 and the end walls 35 by bringing the slanted surfaces 58 as the lower surfaces of the first and second latching portions 55, 56 substantially into sliding contact with the upper surfaces of the partition walls 34 and the end walls 35.<br>
When the front wall member 50 reaches the full locking position 2P (second position), the front surface of the front wall member 50 preferably substantially is continuous and/or in flush with the front surface of the mounting frame 27 and/or the lower surface of the front wall member 50 preferably substantially is continuous and/or in flush with the bottom surface of the female housing 10. Further, a guide hole 36 vertically penetrates the lateral (upper) wall 26 of the mounting frame 27. At or close to the upper end (front end as seen in the mounting direction MD) of the front wall member 50 is formed at least one pressing portion 59 in the form of a projection at least partly fittable into the guide groove 36. When the front wall member 50 reaches the full locking position 2P (second position), the pressable portion 59 is at least partly, preferably substantially fully fitted into the guide groove 36 and the upper or distal end thereof is at least partly exposed at the lateral (upper) surface of the female housing 10 as shown in FIG. 1. The front wall member 50 can be moved towards or to the partial locking position 1P (first position) by pressing or operating this exposed upper or distal end downward (in a direction substantially opposite to the mounting direction MD).<br>
When the front wall member 50 reaches or is positioned at the full locking position 2P (second position), the tab insertion holes 51 come to<br>
substantially communicate with the cavities 11 and the jig insertion holes 52 come to substantially communicate with the mold-removal holes 14. Accordingly, if the tabs 70 are at least partly inserted into the tab insertion holes 51 from front in this state, the leading ends of the tabs 70 at least partly enter the main portions 41 of the female terminal fittings 40 at least partly inserted into the cavities 11 through the tab insertion holes 51, thereby coming substantially into contact with the resilient contact pieces 45 provided in the main portions 41, to establish electrical connections. When an unlocking jig (not shown) for disengaging the locking portion 12 from the female terminal fitting 40 is at least partly inserted into the jig insertion hole 52 from front, the leading end thereof at least partly enters the mold-removal hole 14 through the jig insertion hole 52 to come into contact with the front surface of the locking projection 12A at the leading end of the locking portion 12, with the result that the locking portion 12 can be pushed up or deflected toward the deformation space 13 in unlocking direction.<br>
Contrary to this, when the front wall member 50 reaches or is positioned at the partial locking position 1P (first position), the tab insertion holes 51 are displaced or offset from the cavities 11 as shown in FIG. 2, wherefore the tabs 70 cannot enter the main portions 41 of the female terminal fittings 40 even if being inserted into the displaced tab insertion holes 51. Further, the front lower parts of the detecting plates 46 of the female terminal fittings 40 come to substantially face the jig insertion holes 52. Thus, if detection probes 60 are inserted into these jig insertion holes 52 from front, the leading ends thereof come into contact with the front lower parts of the detecting plates 46, and<br>
whether or not the female terminal fittings 40 are properly inserted in the cavities 11 can be detected preferably based on electrical connections between the detection probes 60 and the detecting plates 46.<br>
Next, functions of this embodiment are described. Upon assembling the above construction, the front wall member 50 is first loosely fitted into the mounting frame 27 from a mounting side, preferably substantially from below or in the mounting direction MD. In this state, the front wall member 50 is pushed in the mounting direction MD or up to let the second latching portions 56 thereof resiliency move over the end walls 35 of the female housing 10 and to at least partly fit the second latching portions 56 into the first receiving portions 31, whereby the front wall member 50 can reach or is positioned the partial locking position 1P (first position) as shown in FIG. 2. The front wall member 50 can reach or be moved towards the full locking position 2P (second position) as shown in FIG. 1 by pushing the front wall member 50 in the mounting direction MD or up to at least partly fit the second latching portions 56 into the second receiving portions 32 and/or to at least partly fit the first latching portions 55 into the first receiving portions 31. Subsequently or concurrently, the retainer 90 is set in the female housing 10 and held at the partial locking position.<br>
Then, the female terminal fitting 40 is at least partly inserted into the cavity 11 from an inserting side, preferably substantially from behind, preferably to be resiliency locked by the locking portion 12. At this time, a part of the rear surface of the front wall member 50 around the tab insertion hole 51 substantially faces the front edge of the female terminal fitting 40. After the insertion of all the female terminal fittings 40 is completed, the retainer 90 is<br>
pushed in the inserting direction or up obliquely forward to reach the full locking position (second position), thereby (preferably doubly) locking the female terminal fittings 40. In this state, the tab insertion holes 51 of the front wall member 50 are substantially aligned with the tab insertion openings 41G of the main portions 41 of the female terminal fittings 40, and the jig insertion holes 52 of the front wall member 50 substantially communicate with the mold-removal holes 14 of the female housing 10.<br>
Thereafter, when the male connector housing is connected from front, the tabs 70 of the one or more male terminal fittings at least partly enter the one or more main portions 41 of the respective female terminal fittings 40 through the one or more tab insertion holes 51 of the front wall member 50 as shown in FIG. 5. At this time, if the tabs 70 enter at positions displaced from proper ones due to an error in positioning the two housings, the tabs 70 preferably come substantially into contact with the opening edges of the tab insertion holes 51 by deviating from the tab insertion holes 51 of the front wall member 50. Accordingly, even if the female housing 10 is formed with the mold-removal holes 14 communicating with the cavities 11, the erroneous entrance of the tabs 70 into the mold-removal holes 14 can be prevented. In addition, since preferably one or more slanted or rounded surfaces 51A for guiding the tabs 70 are formed at least partly around the tab insertion holes 51 in the front surface of the front wall member 50 in this embodiment, the positions of the tabs 70 are corrected to securely guide the tabs 70 into the main portions 41 of the female terminal fittings 40.<br>
Upon detaching or removing the female terminal fitting(s) 40, the retainer 90 is returned to the partial locking position (first position) or detached and the unlocking jig is at least partly inserted through the jig insertion hole 52 from front. Then, this jig at least partly enters the mold-removal hole 14 from the jig insertion hole 52 to bring the leading end thereof substantially into contact with the leading end of the locking portion 12, whereby the locking portion 12 can be resiliency displaced or deflected upward (toward the deformation space 13). After being disengaged from the locking portion 12, the female terminal fitting 40 is successively withdrawn.<br>
On the other hand, upon conducting an electrical connection test for the female terminal fittings 40, the front wall member 50 is pushed or positioned to be held or located at the partial locking position 1P (first position) as shown in FIG. 6. At the partial locking position 1P (first position), the jig insertion holes 52 of the front wall member 50 are located substantially before the front lower parts (corresponding to preferred detecting portions) of the detecting plates 46 of the female terminal fittings 40 at least partly inserted into the cavities 11. In this state, as shown in FIG. 7, the one or more detection probes 60 are or can be at least partly inserted through the jig insertion holes 52 of the front wall member 50 from front and brought into contact with (preferably the front lateral or lower parts of) the detecting plates 46 to conduct the electrical connection test.<br>
At the partial locking position 1P (first position) of the front wall member 50, the tab insertion holes 51 are located at non-matching or substantially unaligned positions deviated from the centers of the tab insertion openings 41G<br>
of the main portions 41 of the female terminal fittings 40 at least partly inserted in the cavities 11. Accordingly, even if the detection probes 60 are inadvertently inserted into the tab insertion holes 51 of the front wall member 50 in this state, they cannot enter the main portions 41 preferably by coming into contact with the front edges of the terminal fittings or the front surface of the female housing 10, wherefore the contact of the detection probes 60 and the resilient contact pieces 45 can be avoided.<br>
As described above, since the erroneous insertion of the tabs 70 can be prevented by the front wall member 50 according to this embodiment, this construction is particularly effectively for small-size connectors with which such an erroneous insertion of the tabs 70 are likely to occur.<br>
Further, when the front wall member 50 is at the partial locking position 1P (first position), the detection probes 60 for electrical connection test come into contact with parts of the terminal fittings 40 (preferably the front lower parts of the detecting plates 46 provided at positions) different from the resilient contact pieces 45 in the female terminal fittings 40 through the jig insertion holes 52 of the front wall member 50. Thus, the electrical connection test can be conducted without toughing the resilient contact pieces 45 and the deformation and the like of the resilient contact pieces 45 can be prevented at the time of the electrical connection test. At this time, if the detection probes 60 for electrical connection test should be at least partly inserted into the tab insertion holes 51, they cannot enter the main portions 41, wherefore the contact of the detection probes 60 and the resilient contact pieces 45 can be securely avoided.<br>
Since the jig insertion holes 52 function as through holes for permitting the unlocking jig to reach the locking portion 12 at the full locking position 2P (second position) of the front wall member 50 while functioning as through holes for permitting the detection probes 60 to reach the (preferably front lower parts of) the detecting plates 46 at the partial locking position 1P (first position) of the front wall member 50, it is not necessary to separately form two kinds of such through holes, wherefore the construction of the front wall member 50 can be simplified and made smaller.<br>
Further, since the detection probes 60 are brought or bringable into contact with (preferably the front lower parts of) the detecting plates 46 of the female terminal fittings 40 at the time of the electrical connection test, large contact areas with the detection probes 60 can be ensured, thereby improving the reliability of the electrical connection test.<br>
Accordingly, to avoid the erroneous insertion of tabs, a front wall member 50 movable or displaceable between a full locking position 2P (as a preferred second position) and a partial locking position 1P (as a preferred first position) is to be mounted on or to the front surface of a female housing 10. When the front wall member 50 is at the full locking position 2P (as a preferred second position) and one or more female terminal fittings 40 are at least partly inserted in cavities 11, one or more mating tabs 70 can at least partly enter main portions 41 of the female terminal fittings 40 through (respective) tab insertion holes 51 of the front wall member 50 to come substantially into contact with resilient contact pieces 45 and an unlocking jig can be at least partly inserted into a mold-removal hole 14 of the female housing 10 through a<br>
(respective) jig insertion hole 52 of the front wall member 50 to substantially come into contact with a locking portion 12, whereby the locking portion 12 can be resiliency displaced in unlocking direction. When the front wall member 50 is at the partial locking position 1P (as a preferred first position), detection probes 60 for electrical connection test can be at least partly inserted into the jig insertion holes 52 of the front wall member 50 from front and preferably brought into contact with the main portions 41 of the female terminal fittings 40, preferably with the front surfaces of detecting plates 46 formed at positions different from resilient contact pieces 45 in main portions 41 of the female terminal fittings 40. <second embodiment></second>
Next, a second preferred embodiment of the present invention is described with reference to FIGS. 16 to 22. A connector of this embodiment is provided with a female connector housing (hereinafter, ,,female housing 10") connectable with a male connector housing (not shown), and a front wall member 50 is integrally or unitarily coupled to the female housing 10 via one or more hinges 30 and mountable on or to the front surface of the female housing 10. In other words, the second embodiment substantially differs from the first embodiment in that the front wall member 50 is integral or unitary to the female housing 10. In the following description, the similar or same construction as the first embodiment is at least partly described again in order to clarify the features of this embodiment.<br>
The female housing 10 is made e.g. of a synthetic resin into a block preferably having a laterally long cross section. The female housing 10 is<br>
internally formed with one or more a plurality of cavities 11 at one or more stages, preferably at each of two (upper and lower) stages, the cavities penetrating the female housing 10 substantially in forward and backward directions FBD. One or more female terminal fittings 40 can be at least partly accommodated into the cavities 11 from an inserting side, preferably substantially from behind, and front openings of the cavities 11 permit the passage of tabs of male terminal fittings (not shown) at least partly accommodated in the male connector housing.<br>
Each female terminal fitting 40 is, as shown in FIG. 16, an integral or unitary assembly of a main portion 41, a wire connection portion (preferably comprising a wire barrel 42 and/or an insulation barrel 43) located behind or adjacent to the main portion 41 to be connected (preferably crimped or bent or folded into connection) with a wire W. One or more, preferably a pair of stabilizers 44 preferably spaced apart along forward and backward directions FBD projects outward or upward from one lateral edge of the main portion 41. The stabilizers 44 can be held substantially in sliding contact with an escaping groove (not shown) formed at each cavity, preferably substantially along one corner of the upper surface of each cavity 11, and functions to prevent an improperly oriented (e.g. upside-down) insertion of the female terminal fitting 40 because of an unmatched positional relationship of the stabilizer(s) 44 and the escaping groove when the female terminal fitting 40 is inserted improperly oriented (e.g. upside down).<br>
As shown in FIG. 21, a (preferably substantially cantilever-shaped) resilient contact piece 45 folded back or bent at or close to the front edge is at<br>
least partly arranged in or at the main portion 41. The resilient contact piece 45 has an angled side view and is resiliently deformable substantially upward and downward or in a direction intersecting an inserting direction of the mating tab 70 into the main portion 41. A contact point 45A with the mating tab projects at the tip of the resilient contact piece 45 to resiliently squeeze or sandwich or contact the tab in cooperation with a receiving portion 41F projecting inward from an inner wall of the main portion 41 facing the contact point 45A.<br>
A locking portion 12 preferably is integrally or unitarily formed at a lateral surface (e.g. the upper surface) of each cavity 11 of the female housing 10. The locking portion 12 preferably substantially cantilevers forward with its portion connected with the upper surface of the cavity 11 as a base end and is resiliently deformable upward and downward or in a direction intersecting an insertion direction of the terminal fitting 40 into the cavity 11. A locking projection 12A projecting substantially toward the cavity 11 is formed at the free end of the locking portion 12. A deformation space 13 is defined above or outside of the locking portion 12 (a side thereof substantially opposite to a terminal fitting arranging space). A mold-removal hole 14 left in the front surface of the female housing 10 as the locking portion 12 is formed is present before the locking portion 12 including the deformation space 13, and substantially communicates with the cavity 11. The locking portion 12 comes to interfere with the female terminal fitting 40 during the insertion of the female terminal fitting 40 into the cavity 11, thereby being pushed up or laterally or deformed toward the deformation space 13. When the female terminal fitting 40 is substantially properly inserted, the locking portion 12 is resiliently at least<br><br>
partly restored to engage the locking projection 12a with a portion of the main portion 41, preferably with a locking hole 47 formed in the main portion 41, thereby retaining the female terminal fitting 40.<br>
A lock arm 15 is formed substantially at a widthwise intermediate position (preferably substantially at the widthwise center) of the lateral (upper) surface of the female housing 10. The lock arm 15 preferably substantially cantilevers backward (or along the forward and backward directions FED) with the base end thereof supported on the front end of the lateral (upper) surface of the female housing 10, and an operable portion 15A is provided at or close to the free end thereof. A lock projection 15B is formed at a longitudinal intermediate position (preferably at a substantially longitudinal middle position) of the lateral (upper) surface of the lock arm 15. The lock projection 15B is resiliency engaged or engageable with the male connector housing as the lock arm 15 is resiliency deformed, thereby inseparably holding the two housings connected.<br>
The lock arm 15 has the lower or inner surface (surface substantially facing the lateral (upper) surface of the female housing 10 thereof chamfered in an area preferably substantially behind the substantially longitudinal middle position, thereby forming a slanted surface 15E. A rear area of the lateral (upper) surface of the female housing 10 substantially facing or corresponding to this slanted surface 15E is slightly lowered or recessed as compared to a front area, so that a sufficient deformation space for the lock arm 15 can be ensured between the rear area of the lock arm 15 and the rear area of the lateral (upper) surface of the female housing 10. Inside the front area of the<br>
lateral (upper) surface of the female housing 10 are formed the one or more deformation spaces 13 for the locking portions 12, whereby the height of the female housing 10 is reduced as a whole.<br>
A turning preventing wall 16 at least partly surrounding the operable portion 15A of the lock arm 15 stands on or project from the lateral (upper) surface of the female housing 10. As shown in FIG. 17, the turning preventing wall 16 preferably is substantially bridge- or gate-shaped as a whole by a pair of leg portions 16A connected with the opposite ends of the lateral (upper) surface of the female housing 10 and a ceiling or top portion 16B spanning between the leg portions 16A, and the operable portion 15A is at least partly arranged inside the turning preventing wall 16. Such a turning preventing wall 16 can prevent the lock arm 15 from being turned up or deflected upwards when the lock arm 15 gets caught by an external matter such as a looped wire W from behind. The ceiling portion 16B of the turning preventing wall 16 is notched or recessed to form a finger or operating hole 16E enabling finger the lock arm 15 to be operated, e.g. by pushing the operable portion 15A by means of a finger.<br>
A retainer mount hole 17 used to mount a retainer 90 is formed in the lateral (bottom) surface of the female housing 10. The retainer mount hole 17 is formed in one or more, preferably in three surfaces of the female housing 10 to extend from the lateral (bottom) surface to the (preferably substantially opposite) adjacent side surfaces, wherefore the retainer mount hole 17 is open atone or more sides, preferably at three sides. The retainer mount hole 17 has such a depth as to communicate with or intersect the respective cavities 11, thereby dividing the cavities 11 at the one or more stages, preferably at the two<br>
(upper and lower) stages into front and rear parts. The rear edges of the retainer mount hole 17 in the opposite side surfaces of the female housing 10 preferably are inclined edges 17 inclined or sloped up toward the front.<br>
One or more guide ribs 19 are arranged preferably substantially in parallel with the inclined edges 17A on the (preferably substantially opposite) side surface(s) of the female housing 10 preferably while at least partly covering the openings of the retainer mount hole 17. Each guide rib 19 preferably is in the form of an elongated plate and has one end at the shorter side connected with the front upper end of the opening of the retainer mount hole 17 and/or has the other end at the shorter side connected with a restricting wall 21. The restricting wall 21 preferably substantially horizontally spans between the other end of the guide rib 19 and the lower side of the inclined edge 17A. A guide hole 22 into which a corresponding engaging projection 91 of the retainer 90 is at least partly fittable is defined between the guide rib 19 and the inclined edge 17A, and the engaging projection 91 of the retainer 90 can be held substantially in sliding contact with this guide hole 22. The retainer 90 is prevented from coming off (downward or laterally or outward) by the contact of the engaging projections 91 of the retainer 90 with the upper or opposite edges of the restricting walls 21. One or more locking projections 24 extend substantially in forward and backward directions FBD on recessed surfaces 23 slightly retracted from peripheral areas of the (preferably substantially opposite) side surface(s) of the female housing 10 before the retainer mount hole 17.<br>
The retainer 90 is made e.g. of a synthetic resin similar to the female housing 10, and includes a retainer main body 92 at least partly fittable into the retainer mount hole 17 and supporting plate 93 bulging out forward from the bottom end (rear end as seen in a moving direction of the retainer) of the retainer main body 92.<br>
As shown in FIG. 22, the retainer main body 92 is formed with one or more window frames 94, preferably with as many window frames 94 as the cavity 11 at each stage of the female housing 10. The respective window frames 94 are formed to be substantially alignable with the cavities 11 at the lower stage of the female housing 10, the front opening edges of the respective window frames 94 preferably are substantially vertical so as to substantially conform to the rear opening edges of the front parts of the respective cavities 11 divided into the front and rear parts by the retainer mount hole 17, and/or the rear opening edges thereof are formed to have an inclination in conformity with the inclination of the front opening edges of the rear parts of the divided cavities 11.<br>
The retainer 90 is movable between a partial locking position (first position) and a full locking position (second position). When the retainer 90 is at the partial locking position (first position), the (lower and/or upper) surfaces of the respective window frames 94 are substantially at the substantially same heights as the lateral (bottom) surfaces of the corresponding cavities 11 to permit the insertion and withdrawal of the female terminal fittings 40. On the other hand, if the retainer 90 is moved to the full locking position (second position), lower front end surfaces and/or upper front end surfaces of the<br>
respective window frames 94 come to be substantially opposed to portions of the terminal fittings 40, preferably to the rear edges of the main portions 41 of the female terminal fittings 40 to doubly lock the female terminal fittings 40 in cooperation with the locking portions 12. The engaging projections 91 are formed substantially along the inclination of the rear surfaces of the respective window frames 94 on the opposite side surfaces of the retainer main body 92.<br>
The supporting plate 93 of the retainer 90 is so dimensioned as to at least partly, preferably substantially fully close the opening of the retainer mount hole 17 in the lateral (bottom) surface of the female housing 10 when the retainer 90 is at the full locking position (second position). Preferably one or more, preferably a pair of standing plates 95 project or vertically stand from the (preferably substantially opposite) ends of the supporting plate 93. Both standing plates 95 are so spaced apart as to be capable of holding the female housing 10 at least partly between the recessed surfaces 23 of the opposite side surfaces, and are deformable inward and outward to change a spacing therebetween. The rear edges of the standing plates 95 are so arranged as to extend along the front edges of the guide ribs 19 of the female housing 10, and the one or more guide ribs 19 are held between the standing plates 95 and the engaging projections 91. One or more engaging projections 96 are so formed on the inner surfaces of the upper ends of the standing plates 95 as to face each other.<br>
When the retainer 90 is at the partial locking position (first position), the engaging projections 96 of the retainer 90 are in contact with the lower surfaces of the locking projections 24 of the female housing 10, thereby preferably<br>
preventing any further oblique upward movement of the retainer 90, and/or the engaging projections 91 are in contact with the upper edges of the restricting walls 21 to preferably prevent the retainer 90 from coming off. In the process of moving the retainer 90 to the full locking position (second position), the engaging projections 96 move onto the locking projections 24 while the standing plates 95 are deformed to widen the spacing therebetween. When the retainer 90 reaches the full locking position (second position), the standing plates 95 are at least partly restored towards or to their initial postures to engage the engaging projections 96 with the upper or distal surfaces of the locking projections 24, whereby the retainer 90 is held or located at the full locking position (second position).<br>
A mounting frame 27 projecting from the front surface of the female housing 10 and is preferably gate-shaped by opposite side walls 25 and an upper wall 26 being formed at or on or close to the front surface of the female housing 10. The front wall member 50 is made e.g. of a synthetic resin into a preferably substantially flat plate, and preferably is mounted onto the mounting frame 27 by being rotated or turned.<br>
The front wall member 50 is formed with one or more tab insertion holes 51, preferably as many tab insertion holes 51 as the respective cavities 11, wherein the tab insertion holes 51 can substantially communicate with the corresponding cavities 11 and are arranged along width direction at one or more stages, preferably at two (upper and lower) stages, and is also formed with one or more jig insertion holes 52 that can substantially communicate with the mold-removal holes 14 left as the locking portions 12 are formed. The jig<br>
insertion holes 52 are arranged at one or more stages, preferably at two (upper and lower) stages and have an offset positional relationship with the respective tab insertion holes 51. Two jig insertion holes 52 at each end of the upper stage make openings in the upper end of the front wall member 50.<br>
One or more, preferably a plurality of vertical ribs 53 that substantially can be connected or aligned with partition walls 28 partitioning the cavities 11 in the female housing 10 are formed preferably substantially side by side on the rear surface of the front wall member 50 (surface of the front wall member 50 substantially facing the female housing 10whenmounted thereon). A base portion 54 bulges out backward from the bottom end of the rear surface of the front wall member 50, and the base ends of the vertical ribs 53 are coupled to the upper surface of this base portion 54.<br>
The front wall member 50 is formed to be integral or unitary to the female housing 10 via the one or more hinges 30. As shown in FIG. 19, the hinges 30 are resiliency deformably formed between pairs of slits 29 having open front ends at two positions of a bottom wall 10A of the female housing 10 near the opposite sides. The lower surfaces of the hinges 30 preferably are substantially continuous and/or in flush with the bottom surface of the female housing 10, and/or the upper surfaces thereof are located substantially at the bottoms of bored portions 10B formed at intermediate positions of the bottom wall 10A of the female housing 10 with respect to thickness direction as shown in FIG. 20. Therefore, the hinges 30 are made thinner to ensure flexible resilient deformations.<br>
The front wall member 50 is rotatably or pivotably supported by both hinges 30 by being connected to ends of the one or more hinges 30 preferably at two bottom positions near the opposite sides. Accordingly, the connected positions of the front wall member 50 and the hinges 30 are set to be more backward than the front end of the female housing 10 including the mounting frame 27 as shown in FIG. 20.<br>
The front wall member 50 is displaceable between a mounted position MP (closed state) where the front wall member 50 is mounted on or to the front surface of the female housing 10 and an unmounted position UMP (opened state, but not limited to one specific position) where the female housing 10 is distanced from the front surface of the female housing 10 by being rotated or pivoted about the hinges 30.<br>
As shown in FIG. 20, the front wall member 50 is or can be molded while being at an initial position IP where the front wall member 50 assumes a horizontal posture by being rotated about the hinges 30 by about 90° in opening direction from the mounted position MP and the tab insertion holes 51, the jig insertion holes 52 and the retainer mount holes 17 in the bottom surface of the female housing 10 are open in the same direction. Accordingly, the connector assumes the state shown in FIG. 20 when being molded. Therefore, upon molding the front wall member 50, the tab insertion holes 51 and the jig insertion holes 52 can be formed using a mold for forming the retainer mount hole 17 (mold not shown) slidable along vertical direction in FIG. 20).<br>
As shown in FIGS. 17 and 21, the front wall member 50 is (preferably substantially closely) fittable into the mounting frame 27 at the mounted position<br>
MP. The front wall member 50 preferably is permitted to make substantially only rotary movements RM about the hinges 30. If the unmounted position UMP is a rotation starting position, the mounted position MP is a rotation ending position. For example, no movement other than the rotary movement RM such as a parallel movement of the mounting frame 27 toward the front surface of the female housing 10 after the rotation of the front wall member 50 is not accompanied. In this case, the hinges 30 deal with the rotation RM of the front wall member 50 by resiliency deforming the connected portions with the front wall member 50.<br>
A lock piece 55 projects in a rear-half area of the thickness of the front wall member 50 at an intermediate position (preferably substantially at a middle part) of the distal or upper end of the frame wall member 50 (e.g. above two middle jig insertion holes 52 at the upper stage). The lock piece 55 has a laterally long shape whose base end preferably is connected with one or more vertical ribs 53, wherein the front surface thereof is formed into a substantially vertical locking surface 55A (or at an angle different from 0° or 180°, preferably substantially normal to a rotary direction RM of the front wall member 50) and the rear surface thereof is formed into a slanted guide surface 55B inclined upward toward the front.<br>
On the other hand, the upper wall 26 of the mounting frame 27 preferably is formed with a receiving portion 71 in the form of a laterally long slit formed by hollowing or recessing an intermediate portion (preferably substantially a middle part) of the base end of the lock arm 15. The receiving portion 71 is open in the rear surface of the base end of the lock arm 15 and in<br>
the lower or inner surface of the upper wall 26. When the front wall member 50 substantially reaches the mounted position MP, the lock piece 55 of the front wall member 50 is resiliency at least partly fitted into the receiving portion 71 so that the front wall member 50 can be retained. The front surface of the receiving portion 71 is formed into a substantially vertical engaging surface 71A to ensure a strong locking force in cooperation with the locking surface 55A of the lock piece 55. Since the guide surface 55B of the lock piece 55 comes into sliding contact with the lower surface of the upper wall 26 before the front wall member 50 reaches the mounted position MP, the smooth rotation RM of the front wall member 50 during this time can be ensured.<br>
When the front wall member 50 reaches the full locking or mounting position MP, the upper end and/or the opposite sides thereof are at least partly covered by the mounting frame 27 as shown in FIG. 17, the tab insertion holes 51 of the front wall member 50 substantially communicate with the cavities 11, and/or the jig insertion holes 52 substantially communicate with the mold-removal holes 14. Accordingly, if the tabs are at least partly inserted into the tab insertion holes 51 from front in this state, the leading ends of the tabs enter the main portions 41 of the female terminal fittings 40 at least partly inserted in the cavities 11 through the tab insertion holes 51, thereby coming substantially into contact with the resilient contact pieces 45 provided in the main portions 41 to establish electrical connections therebetween. On the other hand, if an unlocking jig (not shown) for disengaging the locking portion 12 from the female terminal fitting 40 is at least partly inserted into the jig insertion hole 52 from front, the leading end of the jig at least partly enters the mold-removal hole 14<br>
through the jig insertion hole 52 to come substantially into contact with the front surface of the locking projection 12A at the leading end of the locking portion 12, whereby the locking portion 12 can be pushed up or deflected substantially toward the deformation space 13 in unlocking direction.<br>
Next, functions of this embodiment are described. First, the front wall member 50 substantially at the unmounted position UMP is rotated about the hinges 30 in closing direction RD (direction of arrow in FIG. 20) so as to substantially reach the mounted position MP. At this time, the front wall member 50 is or can be mounted on or to the female housing 10 through a one-touch operation because of the resilient engagement of the lock piece 55 and the receiving portion 71. At the mounted position MP, the side edges of the front wall member 50 are at least partly, preferably substantially fully covered by the mounting frame 27, wherefore the front wall member 50 is at least partly, preferably substantially fully hidden behind the mounting frame 27 when being viewed from sideways and/or above.<br>
Subsequently or concurrently, the retainer 90 is set in the female housing 10 and held at the partial locking position (first position) and, in this state, the female terminal fitting 40 is at least partly inserted into the cavity 11 from the inserting side, preferably substantially from behind, up to a substantially proper insertion position, thereby being resiliency locked by the locking portion 12. At this time, a part of the rear surface (surface substantially facing the housing 10) of the front wall member 50 at least partly around the tab insertion hole 51 can function as a front stop wall for the female terminal fitting 40 preferably by being substantially opposed to the front edge of the female<br>
terminal fitting 40. After the insertion of all the female terminal fittings 40 is completed, the retainer 90 is or can be pushed up or moved obliquely forward to reach the full locking position (second position), thereby (preferably doubly) locking the female terminal fittings 40.<br>
In this state, the tab insertion holes 51 of the front wall member 50 are substantially aligned with the front openings of the main portions 41 of the female terminal fittings 40 and/or the jig insertion holes 52 of the front wall member 50 substantially communicate with the mold-removal holes 14 of the female housing 10 as shown in FIG. 21.<br>
Thereafter, when the mating male connector housing is connected from front, the tabs of the male terminal fittings at least partly enter the main portions 41 of the female terminal fittings 40 through the tab insertion holes 51 of the front wall member 50. At this time, if the tabs try to enter at positions deviated from substantially proper ones e.g. due to a positioning error between the two housings, the tabs are displaced from the tab insertion holes 51 of the front wall member 50 to come into substantially contact with the opening edges of the tab insertion holes 51. Accordingly, the erroneous insertion of the tabs into the mold-removal holes 14 can be prevented even if the female housing 10 is formed with the mold-removal holes 14 communicating with the cavities 11. Further, since slanted surfaces 51A for guiding the tabs preferably are formed in the front surface of the front wall member 50 at least partly around the tab insertion holes 51 in this embodiment, the displacements of the tabs can be corrected to be securely guided into the main portions 41 of the female terminal fittings 40.<br><br>
Upon withdrawing the female terminal fitting 40, the unlocking jig is at least partly inserted into the jig insertion hole 52 from front after the retainer 90 is returned to the partial locking position (first position) or detached from the female housing 10. Then, the unlocking jig is at least partly inserted into the mold-removal hole 14 through the jig insertion hole 52 to bring the leading end thereof into contact with the leading end of the locking portion 12, wherefore the locking portion 12 can be resiliency displaced upward or deflected (toward the deformation space 13). After being disengaged from the locking portion 12, the female terminal fitting 40 is successively pulled out.<br>
As described above, according to this embodiment, the front wall member 50 is formed to be integral or unitary to the female housing 10 via the one or more hinges 30. Thus, it is not necessary to separately form the front wall member 50 and the female housing 10, thereby reducing the number of parts and making it easier to mold the connector.<br>
Further, since the front wall member 50 is rotatable or pivotable about the hinges 30 and the rotation ending position thereof along closing direction is or corresponds to the mounted position MP on the female housing 10, the front wall member 50 can be mounted on the front surface of the female housing 10 through one movement, improving mounting operability.<br>
Furthermore, since the position of the front wall member 50 reached by rotating the front wall member 50 by about 90° in opening direction from the mounted position MP is the initial position (IP) and the tab insertion holes 51 and the retainer mount hole 17 are open in the substantially same direction at this initial position IP, the mold can be simplified by setting the posture of the<br>
housing at the time of molding to the one where the front wall member 50 is at the initial position IP.<br>
When the front wall member 50 is mounted on or to the front surface of the female housing 10, the side edges thereof preferably are protected by being at least partly covered by the mounting frame 27. Thus, a situation where the front wall member 50 is inadvertently detached from the front surface of the female housing 10 due to the intrusion of an external matter from the outside can be avoided or its likeliness reduced. <br>
