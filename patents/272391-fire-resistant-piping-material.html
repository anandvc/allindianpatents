				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
FIRE-RESISTANT PIPING MATERIAL<br>
Technical Field<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention particularly relates to a fire-<br>
resistant piping material that is excellent in fire<br>
resistance and is used in a construction passing through a<br>
partition of a building.<br>
Background Art<br>
[0002]<br>
Buildings have fireproof compartments defined depending<br>
on the types and specifications of the buildings. In the<br>
fireproof compartments, according to the specifications,<br>
flooring materials and wall materials for fireproof<br>
construction or semi-fireproof construction prescribed by<br>
the Building Standards Act are used. The flooring materials<br>
and the wall materials for fireproof construction or semi-<br>
fireproof construction prescribed by the Building Standards<br>
Act are those defined by the Minister of Land,<br>
Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism or certified by the<br>
Minister of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism, and<br>
examples thereof include ferroconcrete; concrete blocks,<br>
brick constructions, and stone constructions that are<br>
reinforced with iron materials; iron materials covered with<br>
steel mortar or concrete on both surfaces thereof;<br>
lightweight foamed concrete; precast concrete plates; and<br>
laminates of plywood and gypsum board, hard wood chip cement<br>
board, or lightweight foamed concrete.<br>
[0003]<br>
Incidentally, buildings are provided with piping (such<br>
as electrical conduits, drain pipes, and ducts). Such<br>
piping passes through the above-mentioned fireproof<br>
compartment in some cases.<br>
When a through-hole through which piping or the like<br>
passes (hereinafter, referred to as "compartment pass-<br>
through portion") is provided to the above-mentioned<br>
fireproof compartment, occurrence of fire may cause a big<br>
fire accident within a short period of time by that the fire<br>
and smoke quickly penetrate from the room where the fire<br>
occurred to the next room having the fireproof compartment<br>
therebetween through the compartment pass-through portion.<br>
Therefore, the Building Standards Act establishes that<br>
only materials that passed a fire-resistant test for<br>
compartment pass-through and certified by the Minister of<br>
Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism or evaluated by<br>
fire defense can be used as the piping material passing<br>
through the compartment pass-through portion in a building.<br>
Therefore, the compartment pass-through portion is<br>
provided with fire-protection measures for caulking a gap<br>
with a noncombustible material such as mortar after<br>
installing the piping passing through the compartment so<br>
that no gap is formed between the compartment pass-through<br>
portion and the piping.<br>
[0004]<br>
When the piping material is a metal, since the piping<br>
material itself is heat resistant and noncombustible, a<br>
sufficient effect is observed only by caulking the gap with<br>
a noncombustible material such as mortar, as described<br>
above. However, the metal piping has a large weight and<br>
therefore has a problem that the workability in transferring<br>
and in construction is inferior.<br>
On the other hand, when the piping material is a<br>
synthetic resin, the piping is light in weight, excellent in<br>
workability, and easy to bond, compared to the metal piping.<br>
The synthetic resin piping has thus various merits, but is<br>
inferior in heat resistance and fire resistance. Therefore,<br>
in fire, the piping material is lost by burning or is<br>
deformed by the heat to generate a gap between the<br>
compartment pass-through portion and the piping material,<br>
which may allow the heat, fire, and smoke occurred at one<br>
side of the fireproof compartment to reach the other side.<br>
[0005]<br>
Accordingly, for example, it is employed fire-<br>
protection measures in which a sheet-like covering material<br>
having fire-resistance and expansibility is wound on the<br>
outer surface of the synthetic resin piping material. As<br>
the fire-resistant resin composition constituting the sheet-<br>
like covering material, proposed are those in which a vinyl<br>
chloride-based resin is blended with heat-expandable<br>
graphite, an inorganic filler, and a plasticizer and also<br>
blended with a specific phosphorus compound (for example,<br>
refer to Patent Document 1) and those in which a base resin,<br>
such as rubber, a thermoplastic elastomer, or a liquid<br>
polymer, is blended with heat-expandable graphite serving as<br>
an inorganic expansion agent and also blended with a resin<br>
serving as a deformation-preventing resin, such as a<br>
polycarbonate resin or a polyphenylene sulfide resin (for<br>
example, refer to Patent Document 2).<br>
[0006]<br>
However, in the fire-protection measures using the<br>
sheet-like covering material, a synthetic resin piping<br>
material is temporarily installed, and then the sheet-like<br>
covering material is wound to the piping material at a<br>
portion previously determined. Subsequently, the piping<br>
material is supported and fixed, and then the opening is<br>
filled back with mortar. Therefore, the measures has a<br>
large number of work units and takes a long time and also<br>
has a problem that the adjustment of the piping position<br>
after the winding of the sheet-like covering material to the<br>
piping material is difficult.<br>
[0007]<br>
Accordingly, the above-mentioned problems can be solved<br>
by directly producing a piping material with a resin<br>
composition having fire-resistance and expansibility, but<br>
since the fire-resistant resin composition in Patent<br>
Document 1 contains large amounts of an inorganic filler and<br>
a plasticizer in a vinyl chloride-based resin, the piping<br>
material formed therewith cannot obtain a high mechanical<br>
strength that is an indispensable requirement in a pipe.<br>
Furthermore, since the fire-resistant resin composition in<br>
Patent Document 2 contains rubber, a thermoplastic<br>
elastomer, or a liquid polymer as the base resin, the piping<br>
material formed therewith cannot obtain a high mechanical<br>
strength that is an indispensable requirement in a pipe, as<br>
in the fire-resistant resin composition of Patent Document<br>
1.<br>

covering layer is constituted of a polyvinyl chloride-based<br>
<br>

[0025]<br>
A multilayered fire-resistant piping material of the<br>
invention according to Claim 16, in the invention according<br>
to any one of Claims 9 to 15, when the piping material is<br>
constructed so as to pass through a flooring material and is<br>
subjected to a fire-resistant test (complying with ISO 834-<br>
1) in which the underside of the floor is heated under<br>
conditions that one end of the piping material is exposed to<br>
a heating side by 300 mm from the surface on the heating<br>
side of the flooring material and that the other end of the<br>
piping material is exposed to a non-heating side by 800 mm<br>
from the surface on the non-heating side of the flooring<br>
material, a pipe inner cross-sectional area SI at the end of<br>

pipe inner cross-sectional area S2 at a minimum inner<br>
diameter of the piping material after burning satisfy a<br>
relationship:<br>
(S2/S1)X100 
[0026]<br>
A multilayered fire-resistant piping material of the<br>
invention according to Claim 17, in the invention according<br>
to any one of Claims 9 to 16, the covering layer is provided<br>
on each of the outer surface and the inner surface of the<br>
fire-resistant expandable layer.<br>
[0027]<br>
In the invention according to any of Claims 1 to 8, 1<br>
to 10 parts by weight of heat-expandable graphite is blended<br>
with 100 parts by weight of a polyvinyl chloride-based<br>
resin. This is because that when the amount of the heat-<br>
expandable graphite is smaller than 1 part by weight, a<br>
sufficient heat expansibility cannot be obtained during<br>
burning, which causes insufficient caulking of the inside of<br>
a pipe, ascending of hot air through the inside of the pipe,<br>
and a decrease in fire-resistance performance. On the other<br>
hand, when the amount of the heat-expandable graphite is<br>
larger than 10 parts by weight, the heated composition is<br>
thermally expanded too much to maintain the shape, resulting<br>
in dropping of the residue to decrease the fire-resistance.<br>
Herein, the amount of the heat-expandable graphite is<br>
preferably 1 to 8 parts by weight and further preferably 2<br>
to 7 parts by weight.<br>
[0028]<br>
In the invention according to any of Claims 9 to 17, 1<br>
to 15 parts by weight of heat-expandable graphite is blended<br>
with 100 parts by weight of a polyvinyl chloride-based<br>
resin. This is because that when the amount of the heat-<br>
expandable graphite is smaller than 1 part by weight, a<br>
sufficient heat expansibility cannot be obtained during<br>
burning, which causes insufficient caulking of the inside of<br>
a pipe, ascending of hot air through the inside of the pipe,<br>
and a decrease in fire-resistance performance. On the other<br>
hand, when the amount of the heat-expandable graphite is<br>
larger than 15 parts by weight, the heated composition is<br>
thermally expanded too much to maintain the shape, resulting<br>
in dropping of the residue to decrease the fire-resistance.<br>
Herein, the amount of the heat-expandable graphite is<br>
preferably 1 to 12 parts by weight and further preferably 2<br>
to 10 parts by weight.<br>
[0029]<br>
The heat-expandable graphite used in the present<br>
invention is a crystalline compound maintaining a layer<br>
structure of carbon and is obtained by acid treatment of a<br>
powder such as natural flake graphite, pyrolytic graphite,<br>
or Kish graphite by inserting an inorganic acid between<br>
layers of the graphite using an inorganic acid such as<br>
concentrated sulfuric acid, nitric acid, or selenic acid and<br>
a strong oxidant such as concentrated nitric acid,<br>
perchloric acid, perchlorate, permanganate, dichromate, or<br>
hydrogen peroxide.<br>
[0030]<br>
The heat-expandable graphite having a pH of 1.5 to 4.0<br>
is prepared by adjusting the pH after the acid treatment<br>
described above. The pH adjustment of the heat-expandable<br>
graphite is not particularly limited, but, in the state<br>
after acid treatment by inserting an inorganic acid between<br>
layers of raw material graphite as in above, the pH is<br>
usually 1 or less. Therefore, for example, the acid-treated<br>
graphite is washed with water for removing the remaining<br>
acid on the surface of the graphite, followed by drying.<br>
That is, the pH of the heat-expandable graphite can be<br>
increased by repeating washing with water and drying.<br>
[0031]<br>
In the invention according to any of Claims 2 to 5 and<br>
Claims 10 to 13, heat-expandable graphite that is adjusted<br>
to acidic is used. This is because that the fire-resistance<br>
performance is improved by preventing burning by effectively<br>
carbonizing a polyvinyl chloride resin during burning. This<br>
is based on a property of a polyvinyl chloride-based resin<br>
that repeats a hydrogen chloride elimination reaction in the<br>
presence of an acid to generate a flame-retardant carbide.<br>
However, when the pH of heat-expandable graphite is lower<br>
than 1.5, the too strong acidity may, for example, cause<br>
corrosion of a molding apparatus. On the other hand, when<br>
the pH of h'eat-expandable graphite is higher than 4.0, the<br>
effect of accelerating the carbonization of a polyvinyl<br>
chloride-based resin is low, which may cause insufficient<br>
fire-resistance performance. Accordingly, it is determined<br>
to use heat-expandable graphite having a pH of 1.5 to 4.0.<br>
[0032]<br>
Examples of the polyvinyl chloride-based resin used in<br>
the invention according to any of Claims 1 to 17 include<br>
polyvinyl chloride homopolymers; copolymers of vinyl<br>
chloride monomers and monomers having unsaturated bonds that<br>
are copolymerizable with the vinyl chloride monomers; and<br>
graft copolymers in which vinyl chloride is graft-<br>
copolymerized with (co)polymers other than vinyl chloride.<br>
These may be used alone or in a combination of two or more.<br>
In addition, the polyvinyl chloride-based resin may be<br>
chlorinated, according to need.<br>
[0033]<br>
The monomers having unsaturated bonds that are<br>
copolymerizable with the vinyl chloride monomers are not<br>
particularly limited, and examples thereof include a-olefins<br>
such as ethylene, propylene, and butylene; vinyl esters such<br>
as vinyl acetate and vinyl propionate; vinyl ethers such as<br>
butylvinyl ether and cetylvinyl ether; (meth)acrylic acid<br>
esters such as methyl (meth)acrylate, ethyl (meth)acrylate,<br>
and butyl acrylate; aromatic vinyls such as styrene and a~<br>
methyl styrene; and N-substituted maleimides such as N-<br>
phenyl maleimide and N-cyclohexyl maleimide. These may be<br>
used alone or in a combination of two or more.<br>
[0034]<br>
Any (co)polymer that can graft-(co)polymerize vinyl<br>
chloride can be used for graft-copolymerizing the vinyl<br>
chloride without particular limitation, and examples thereof<br>
include ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymers, ethylene-vinyl<br>
acetate-carbon monoxide copolymers, ethylene-ethyl acrylate<br>
copolymers, ethylene-butyl acrylate-carbon monoxide<br>
copolymers, ethylene-methyl methacrylate copolymers,<br>
ethylene-propylene copolymers, acrylonitrile-butadiene<br>
copolymers, polyurethane, polyethylene chloride, and<br>
polypropylene chloride. These may be used alone or in a<br>
combination of two or more.<br>
[0035]<br>
The average degree of polymerization of the polyvinyl<br>
chloride-based resin is not particularly limited, but is<br>
preferably 400 to 1600 and most preferably 600 to 1400,<br>
since a low average degree of polymerization causes a<br>
decrease in physical properties of a molded article, and a<br>
high average degree causes an increase in melting viscosity<br>
to make molding difficult. In addition, the above-mentioned<br>
"average degree of polymerization" refers to an average<br>
degree of polymerization measured in conformity with JIS K-<br>
6721 "testing method for vinyl chloride resin" using a resin<br>
sample prepared by dissolving a composite vinyl chloride-<br>
based resin in tetrahydrofuran (THF), filtering the solution<br>
for removing insoluble components, and then removing the THF<br>
in the filtrate by drying.<br>
[0036]<br>
The polymerization method of the polyvinyl chloride-<br>
based resin is not particularly limited. Any known<br>
polymerization method may be employed, and examples thereof<br>
include a bulk polymerization method, a solution<br>
polymerization method, an emulsion polymerization method,<br>
and a suspension polymerization method.<br>
[0037]<br>
The chlorination method of the polyvinyl chloride-based<br>
resin is not particularly limited. Any known chlorination<br>
method may be employed, and examples thereof include thermal<br>
chlorination and photochlorination.<br>
[0038]<br>
The polyvinyl chloride-based resin may be cross-linked<br>
or modified within the range that does not impair the fire-<br>
resistance performance as a resin composition. In such a<br>
case, a resin that is cross-linked or modified in advance<br>
may be used, or the cross-linking or modification may be<br>
simultaneously performed when an additive or other component<br>
is blended. Alternatively, the cross-linking or<br>
modification may be performed after blending of the additive<br>
or other component with the resin. The cross-linking of the<br>
resin may be performed by any method without particular<br>
limitation, and a usual cross-linking method of a polyvinyl<br>
chloride-based resin, such as cross-linking using various<br>
types of cross-linking agents or oxides, cross-linking by<br>
electron beam irradiation, or a method using a water cross-<br>
linking agent, may be employed.<br>
[0039]<br>
In the invention according to Claim 4 or 12, the total<br>
additive amount of the group consisting of lead-based<br>
stabilizers, organic tin-based stabilizers, and higher fatty<br>
acid metal salts is 0.3 to 5.0 parts by weight based on 100<br>
parts by weight of the polyvinyl chloride-based resin. This<br>
is because that when the total additive amount of the group<br>
consisting of lead-based stabilizers, organic tin-based<br>
stabilizers, and higher fatty acid metal salts is smaller<br>
than 0.3 parts by weight, the heat stability of the<br>
polyvinyl chloride-based resin is difficult to be ensured<br>
during molding, which may cause easy generation of carbides<br>
during molding. On the other hand, when the total additive<br>
amount of the group consisting of lead-based stabilizers,<br>
organic tin-based stabilizers, and higher fatty acid metal<br>
salts is larger than 5.0 parts by weight, the acceleration<br>
of the carbonization of the polyvinyl chloride-based resin<br>
during burning is inhibited, which may cause insufficient<br>
fire-resistance performance.<br>
[0040]<br>
Examples of the lead-based stabilizers include white<br>
lead, basic lead sulfite, tribasic lead sulfate, dibasic<br>
lead phosphite, dibasic lead phthalate, tribasic lead<br>
maleate, a coprecipitate of silica gel and lead silicate,<br>
dibasic lead stearate, lead stearate, and lead naphthalate.<br>
[0041]<br>
Examples of the organic tin-based stabilizers include<br>
mercaptides such as dibutyltin mercapto, dioctyltin<br>
mercapto, and dimethyltin mercapto; maleates such as<br>
dibutyltin maleate, dibutyltin maleate polymers, dioctyltin<br>
maleate, and dioctyltin maleate polymers; and carboxylates<br>
such as dibutyltin mercapto, dibutyltin laurate, and<br>
dibutyltin laurate polymers.<br>
[0042]<br>
Examples of the higher fatty acid metal salts include<br>
lithium stearate, magnesium stearate, calcium stearate,<br>
calcium laurate, calcium ricinoleate, strontium stearate,<br>
barium stearate, barium laurate, barium ricinoleate, cadmium<br>
stearate, cadmium laurate, cadmium ricinoleate, cadmium<br>
naphthenate, cadmium 2-ethylhexanoate, zinc stearate, zinc<br>
laurate, zinc ricinoleate, zinc 2-ethylhexanoate, lead<br>
stearate, dibasic lead stearate, and lead naphthenate.<br>
[0043]<br>
In the invention according to Claim 5 or 13, the amount<br>
of the basic compound is 0.3 to 5.0 parts by weight based on<br>
100 parts by weight of the polyvinyl chloride-based resin.<br>
This is because that when the additive amount of the basic<br>
compound is smaller than 0.3 parts by weight, the heat<br>
stability of the polyvinyl chloride-based resin is difficult<br>
to be ensured during molding, which may cause easy<br>
generation of carbides during molding. On the other hand,<br>
when the additive amount of the basic compound is larger<br>
than 5.0 parts by weight, the acceleration of carbonization<br>
of the polyvinyl chloride-based resin during burning is<br>
inhibited, which may cause insufficient fire-resistance<br>
performance.<br>
[0044]<br>
The basic compound is not particularly limited, and<br>
examples thereof include calcium carbonate, calcium<br>
silicate, calcium hydroxide, calcium oxide, magnesium<br>
carbonate, magnesium hydroxide, magnesium oxide, barium<br>
carbonate, aluminum hydroxide, zinc oxide, zinc hydroxide,<br>
and iron oxide.<br>
[0045]<br>
In the invention according to Claim 6 or 14, the term<br>
"expansion volume of the heat-expandable graphite" refers to<br>
the volume per gram of heat-expandable graphite after heat<br>
expansion.<br>
[0046]<br>
The expansion volume of heat-expandable graphite is<br>
determined by the following process:<br>
1) One gram of a sample is put in a 500-cc. beaker that<br>
is heated in advance for 20 minutes or more in a heating<br>
furnace and is heated in the heating furnace (furnace<br>
temperature: 1000°C);<br>
2) After 30 seconds, the beaker is taken out from the<br>
heating furnace;<br>
3) The sample in the beaker is cooled to room<br>
temperature;<br>
4) The weight and the volume of the sample after<br>
expansion are measured; and<br>
5) The value of (volume of the sample after expansion)/<br>
(weight of the sample after the expansion) is calculated.<br>
[0047]<br>
The expansion volume of heat-expandable graphite varies<br>
depending on the type and amount of the interlayer compound<br>
of the heat-expandable graphite and on the particle diameter<br>
of the heat-expandable graphite itself, and is a very<br>
important factor for exhibiting fire-resistance.<br>
In the invention according to Claim 6 or 14, the<br>
expansion volume of heat-expandable graphite is 100 to 250<br>
mL/g. This is because that when the expansion volume of<br>
heat-expandable graphite is smaller than 100 mL/g, the<br>
expansion volume is too small to achieve sufficient fire-<br>
resistance, which requires a large amount of heat-expandable<br>
graphite for increasing the fire-resistance and may cause<br>
defects in, for example, physical properties or molding<br>
properties. On the other hand, when the expansion volume of<br>
heat-expandable graphite is larger than 250 mL/g, the heated<br>
composition is thermally expanded too much to maintain the<br>
shape, which may cause dropping of the residue and a<br>
decrease in the fire-resistance. Herein, the expansion<br>
volume of heat-expandable graphite is preferably 120 to 230<br>
mL/g and more preferably 140 to 220 mL/g.<br>
[0048]<br>
In the invention according to Claim 7 or 15, the 1.3-<br>
time expansion temperature of heat-expandable graphite is a<br>
temperature of a heating furnace when a sample of heat-<br>
expandable graphite is heated for 30 minutes in the furnace<br>
in which the temperature is kept constant and the expansion<br>
magnification of the sample is 1.3 times or more at the<br>
temperature.<br>
In addition, expansion magnification is defined by<br>
(volume of sample after heating)/(volume of sample before<br>
heating).<br>
The resin temperature during molding refers to the<br>
highest temperature of the resin during melting.<br>
[0049]<br>
In the invention according to Claim 7 or 15, the 1.3-<br>
time expansion temperature of heat-expandable graphite is<br>
180 to 240°C. This is because that when the 1.3-time<br>
expansion temperature of heat-expandable graphite is lower<br>
than 180°C, the heat-expandable graphite may expand during<br>
molding, which causes a defect in appearance of a pipe and<br>
also may decrease the fire-resistance during burning. On<br>
the other hand, when the 1.3-time expansion temperature of<br>
heat-expandable graphite is higher than 240°C, there is no<br>
risk of starting of expansion of the heat-expandable<br>
graphite during molding, but thermal decomposition (foaming)<br>
of the polyvinyl chloride-based resin progresses during<br>
burning. Therefore, since the heat-expandable graphite<br>
expands after a reduction in plasticity of the polyvinyl<br>
chloride-based resin, the polyvinyl chloride-based resin may<br>
not bear the expansion of the heat-expandable graphite to be<br>
broken to pieces.<br>
[0050]<br>
The fire-resistant test in the invention according to<br>
Claim 8 or 16 is carried out according to an evaluation<br>
method of a performance test for pipe passing through, for<br>
example, a fireproof compartment, based on the revised<br>
Building Standards Act in force on June 1, 2000 (Heisei 12).<br>
The flooring material used was PC (precast concrete) plate<br>
(length: 600 mm, width: 1200 mm, thickness: 100 mm), which<br>
is a flooring material of fireproof construction or semi-<br>
fireproof construction prescribed by the Building Standards<br>
Act.<br>
Examples of the flooring material to be used include,<br>
in addition to the PC plate, the followings:<br>
1) A wood frame member in which a gypsum board<br>
(thickness: 9.5 mm) is bonded to the upper surface of a<br>
structural plywood (thickness: 12 mm) and a reinforced<br>
gypsum board (thickness: 15 mm) is bonded to the lower<br>
surface of the plywood;<br>
2) A wood frame member in which a gypsum board<br>
(thickness: 12.5 mm) is bonded to the upper surface of a<br>
structural plywood (thickness: 12 mm) and two reinforced<br>
gypsum boards (thickness: 12.5 mm) are bonded to the lower<br>
surface of the plywood;<br>
3) A lightweight foamed concrete (ALC) plate having a<br>
thickness of 100 mm or more; and<br>
4) A precast concrete (PC) plate having a thickness of<br>
70 mm or more. In particular, the ALC plate and the PC<br>
plate having a thickness of 100 mm or more are preferred.<br>
The gap between the piping material and the compartment<br>
pass-through portion was caulked with mortar. One end of<br>
the piping material was exposed to a heating side by 300 mm<br>
from the surface on the heating side of the flooring<br>
material, and the other end of the piping material was<br>
exposed to a non-heating side by 800 mm from the surface on<br>
the non-heating side of the flooring material.<br>
The furnace used in the fire-resistant test had a<br>
structure that can heat one surface of a floor material and<br>
can almost uniformly give a temporal change in temperature<br>
based on the following Expression 1 complying with<br>
regulation of ISO 834-1 to all over the entire test surface<br>
of the floor material, when the surface on the heating side<br>
of the floor material was the test surface.<br>
That is, the fire-resistant test furnace was provided<br>
with a thermocouple (hereinafter, referred to as "furnace<br>
thermocouple") for measuring temperature in the furnace at a<br>
position apart from the floor material by 100 to 300 mm such<br>
that one to ten hot junctions were arranged uniformly with<br>
respect to the test surface of the floor material.<br>
Then, according to the regulation of ISO 834-1, the<br>
fire-resistant test furnace was heated so that the temporal<br>
change in temperature (hereinafter, referred to as "heating<br>
temperature") measured by the thermocouple can be expressed<br>
by a numerical value represented by the following Expression<br>
1:<br>
T = 3451ogio (8t+l)+20 a(Expression 1)<br>
In Expression 1, T denotes an average temperature (°C) in<br>
the furnace, and t denotes elapsed time (minute) in the<br>
test, and the temperature was measured within every one<br>
minute period.<br>
[0051]<br>
Regarding the pipe inner cross-sectional area SI at the<br>
end on the heating side of the piping material before<br>
burning, the piping material is measured for inner diameters<br>
at least in two directions before starting of the fire-<br>
resistance test to calculate the average inner diameter, and<br>
then the pipe inner cross-sectional area SI is calculated.<br>
Regarding the pipe inner cross-sectional area S2 at the<br>
minimum inner diameter portion of the piping material after<br>
burning, after starting of the fire-resistance test, when<br>
smoke appears from the gap between the compartment pass-<br>
through portion and the piping material on the non-heating<br>
side, the burning in the fire-resistant test furnace is<br>
terminated, and then the flooring material panel is<br>
immediately removed from the fire-resistant furnace. After<br>
cooling of the pipe, the caulked pipe is observed from the<br>
heating side to determine the projected area S2 thereof.<br>
The S2 may be measured by any method such as the followings:<br>
a method by image analysis of a photograph taken from<br>
the heating side, or<br>
a method by sketching a projected portion on a paper,<br>
cutting out the sketched portion and weighing the cut-out<br>
paper, and determining the S2 by proportional calculation<br>
based on the weight of the paper of which weight per unit<br>
area is already known.<br>
When no smoke was observed for 2 hours, the test is<br>
terminated after 2 hours, and the S2 is measured by the<br>
above-mentioned process.<br>
[0052]<br>
In the invention according to Claim 8 or 16, the value<br>
obtained by the Expression of (S2/Sl)xl00 represents a pipe<br>
inner cross-sectional area proportion (%) after burning. In<br>
the invention according to Claim 8 or 16, the pipe inner<br>
cross-sectional area proportion is 50% or less. This is<br>
because that when the pipe inner cross-sectional area<br>
proportion is larger than 50%, the pass-through portion in a<br>
pipe after burning cannot be effectively caulked, which may<br>
not give a desired fire-resistance performance.<br>
[0053]<br>
In the invention according to any of Claims 1 to 17,<br>
additives, such as a flame retardant, a stabilizer, a<br>
lubricant, a processing aid, an impact modifier, a heat-<br>
resistance-improving agent, an antioxidant, a light<br>
stabilizer, an ultraviolet absorber, a pigment, a<br>
plasticizer, and a thermoplastic elastomer, may be added<br>
within a range that does not impair the physical properties.<br>
[0054]<br>
As the flame retardant, any flame retardant that<br>
increases flame retardancy during burning can be used<br>
without particular limitation, and examples thereof include<br>
hydroxides such as aluminum hydroxide and magnesium<br>
hydroxide; hydrotalcite; antimony oxides such as antimony<br>
dioxide, antimony trioxide, and antimony pentoxide;<br>
molybdenum compounds such as molybdenum trioxide, molybdenum<br>
disulfide, and ammonium molybdate; bromine-based compounds<br>
such as tetrabromobisphenol A, tetrabromethane,<br>
tetrabromethane, tetrabromethane, and tetrabromethane;<br>
phosphorus-based compounds such as triphenyl phosphate and<br>
ammonium polyphosphate; calcium borate; and zinc borate.<br>
From the viewpoint of the effect of preventing burning of<br>
polyvinyl chloride, antimony trioxide is particularly<br>
preferred, because antimony compounds generate halogenated<br>
antimony compounds in the presence of halogenated compounds<br>
under high temperature conditions and prevent a burning<br>
cycle with a very high effect, and the synergetic effect<br>
thereof is significant.<br>
[0055]<br>
By using the flame retardant, the synergetic effect<br>
between the heat-insulating effect by the expansion of heat-<br>
expandable graphite and the flame-retarding effect by the<br>
flame retardant can more efficiently improve the fire-<br>
resistance performance during burning. The additive amount<br>
of the flame retardant is not particularly limited, but is<br>
preferably 1 part by weight or more and 20 parts by weight<br>
or less based on 100 parts by weight of the polyvinyl<br>
chloride-based resin. When the amount of the flame<br>
retardant is less than 1 part by weight, sufficient<br>
synergetic effect may not be obtained. When the amount of<br>
the flame retardant is higher than 20 parts by weight, the<br>
molding properties and the physical properties may be<br>
significantly decreased.<br>
[0056]<br>
The stabilizer is not particularly limited, and<br>
examples thereof include heat stabilizers and heat<br>
stabilization aids. The heat stabilizers are not<br>
particularly limited, and example thereof include organic<br>
tin-based stabilizers such as dibutyltin mercapto,<br>
dioctyltin mercapto, dimethyltin mercapto, dibutyltin<br>
mercapto, dibutyltin maleate, dibutyltin maleate polymers,<br>
dioctyltin maleate, dioctyltin maleate polymers, dibutyltin<br>
laurate, and dibutyltin laurate polymers; lead-based<br>
stabilizers such as lead stearate, dibasic lead phosphate,<br>
and tribasic lead sulfate; calcium-zinc-based stabilizers;<br>
barium-zinc-based stabilizers; and barium-cadmium-based<br>
stabilizers. These may be used alone or in a combination of<br>
two or more.<br>
[0057]<br>
The heat stabilization aids are not particularly<br>
limited, and examples thereof include epoxidized soybean<br>
oil, phosphate esters, polyols, hydrotalcite, and zeolite.<br>
These may be used alone or in a combination of two or more.<br>
[0058]<br>
The lubricant includes an inner lubricant and an outer<br>
lubricant.<br>
The inner lubricant is used for reducing the fluid<br>
viscosity of a melting resin during a molding process to<br>
prevent friction heat generation. The inner lubricant is<br>
not particularly limited, and examples thereof include butyl<br>
stearate, lauryl alcohol, stearyl alcohol, epoxidized<br>
soybean oil, glycerin monostearate, stearic acid, and<br>
bisamides. These may be used alone or in a combination of<br>
two or more.<br>
The outer lubricant is used for accelerating sliding<br>
effect between a melting resin and a metal surface during a<br>
molding process. The outer lubricant is not particularly<br>
limited, and examples thereof include paraffin wax,<br>
polyolefin wax, ester wax, and montanoic acid wax. These<br>
may be used alone or in a combination of two or more.<br>
[0059]<br>
The processing aid is not particularly limited, and<br>
examples thereof include acryl-based processing aids such as<br>
alkyl acrylate-alkyl methacrylate copolymers having a weight<br>
average molecular weight of 100000 to 2000000. The acryl-<br>
based processing aids are not particularly limited, and<br>
examples thereof include n-butyl acrylate-methyl<br>
methacrylate copolymers and 2-ethylhexyl acrylate-methyl<br>
methacrylate-butyl methacrylate copolymers. These may be<br>
used alone or in a combination of two or more.<br>
[0060]<br>
The impact modifier is not particularly limited, and<br>
examples thereof include methyl methacrylate-butadiene-<br>
styrene (MBS) copolymers, polyethylene chloride, and acrylic<br>
rubber.<br>
[0061]<br>
The heat-resistance-improving agent is not particularly<br>
limited, and examples thereof include a-methylstyrene-based<br>
and N-phenylmaleimide-based resins.<br>
[0062]<br>
The antioxidant is not particularly limited, and<br>
examples thereof include phenol-based antioxidants.<br>
[0063]<br>
The light stabilizer is not particularly limited, and<br>
examples thereof include hindered amine light stabilizers.<br>
[0064]<br>
The ultraviolet absorber is not particularly limited,<br>
and examples thereof include salicylic acid ester-based,<br>
benzophenone-based, benzotriazole-based, and cyanoacrylate-<br>
based ultraviolet absorbers.<br>
[0065]<br>
The pigment is not particularly limited, and examples<br>
thereof include organic pigments such as azo-based,<br>
phthalocyanine-based, surene-based, and dye lake-based<br>
pigments; and inorganic pigments such as oxide-based,<br>
molybdenum chromate-based, sulfide/selenide-based, and<br>
ferrocyanide-based pigments.<br>
[0066]<br>
The polyvinyl chloride-based resin may contain a<br>
plasticizer, but since the plasticizer may decrease the<br>
heat-resistance and fire-resistance of a molded article, the<br>
amount thereof is preferably small.<br>
The plasticizer is not particularly limited, and<br>
examples thereof include dibutyl phthalate, di-2-ethylhexyl<br>
phthalate, and di-2-ethylhexyl adipate.<br>
[0067]<br>
The thermoplastic elastomer is not particularly<br>
limited, and examples thereof include acrylnitrile-butadiene<br>
(NBR) copolymers, ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA) copolymers,<br>
ethylene-vinyl acetate-carbon monoxide (EVACO) copolymers,<br>
vinyl chloride-based thermoplastic elastomers such as vinyl<br>
chloride-vinyl acetate copolymers and vinyl chloride-<br>
vinylidene chloride copolymers, styrene-based thermoplastic<br>
elastomers, olefin-based thermoplastic elastomers, urethane-<br>
based thermoplastic elastomers, polyester-based<br>
thermoplastic elastomers, and polyamide-based thermoplastic<br>
elastomers. These thermoplastic elastomers may be used<br>
alone or in a combination of two or more.<br>
[0068]<br>
The method for mixing the additives with the polyvinyl<br>
chloride-based resin is not particularly limited, and<br>
examples thereof include a method by hot-blending and a<br>
method by cold blending.<br>
[0069]<br>
Examples of the fire-resistant piping material of the<br>
present invention include fire-resistant pipes and fire-<br>
resistant pipe joints. Furthermore, the fire-resistant<br>
piping material of the present invention is molded with an<br>
extruder or an injection molder that is usually used. The<br>
type and the screw shape of the molder are not particularly<br>
limited as long as sufficient kneading can be performed,<br>
considering the tensile strength and the impact, and an<br>
extruder allowing continuous molding is preferred.<br>
[0070]<br>
Since the single-layered fire-resistant piping material<br>
of the invention according to Claim 1 is constituted of a<br>
fire-resistant resin composition containing heat-expandable<br>
graphite in an amount of 1 to 10 parts by weight based on<br>
100 parts by weight of a polyvinyl chloride-based resin, the<br>
molding properties thereof are excellent. For example, the<br>
piping material can be continuously produced with high size<br>
accuracy using an extruder, an injection molder, or the<br>
like.<br>
Furthermore, since the polyvinyl chloride-based resin<br>
is self-extinguishing, the burning rate is effectively<br>
reduced, and thereby the flame propagation velocity during<br>
burning can be suppressed. In addition, since the resin<br>
forms foam in the beginning of burning, an advantage that<br>
the heat-expandable graphite readily expands is also<br>
provided.<br>
Furthermore, since heat-expandable graphite itself<br>
hardly burns and thereby exhibits a heat-insulating effect<br>
by being expanded by heat, the burning rate is further<br>
effectively reduced.<br>
Therefore, the single-layered fire-resistant piping<br>
material of the present invention has excellent fire-<br>
resistance and expansibility in itself and thereby can<br>
prevent flame and smoke from penetrating to the other side<br>
partitioned by the compartment pass-through portion by the<br>
expansion of the piping material itself during burning and<br>
the effect of reducing burning rate.<br>
[0071]<br>
The single-layered fire-resistant piping material of<br>
the invention according to Claim 2 includes a fire-resistant<br>
expandable layer made of a fire-resistant resin composition<br>
containing heat-expandable graphite having a pH of 1.5 to<br>
4.0 in an amount of 1 to 10 parts by weight based on 100<br>
parts by weight of a polyvinyl chloride-based resin, and<br>
thereby has the following excellent effects.<br>
That is, since the single-layered fire-resistant piping<br>
material of the invention contains heat-expandable graphite<br>
having a PH of 1.5 to 4.0, during burning, not only the acid<br>
disposed between layers of the heat-expandable graphite but<br>
also the acid remaining on the surface of the heat-<br>
expandable graphite are discharged. Therefore, the amount<br>
of discharged acid is larger than that of the neutralized<br>
heat-expandable graphite, and an elimination reaction of<br>
hydrogen chloride from the polyvinyl chloride-based resin is<br>
accelerated. Consequently, the polyvinyl chloride-based<br>
resin during burning can be effectively carbonized. As a<br>
result, during burning, the residue formed by the expanded<br>
heat-expandable graphite and the carbide of the polyvinyl<br>
chloride-based resin that strongly entwining with each other<br>
can reliably caulk the end of the pipe on the heating side.<br>
In addition, since the heat-expandable graphite has a<br>
pH in the range of 1.5 to 4.0, there is no risk of damaging<br>
a molding apparatus for molding the piping material.<br>
[0072]<br>
In the invention according to Claim 3, in the invention<br>
according to Claim 2, since the fire-resistant resin<br>
composition in Claim 2 contains an additive for providing<br>
heat stability during molding, the elimination reaction of<br>
hydrogen chloride from the polyvinyl chloride-based resin<br>
during molding is suppressed to prevent the resin from being<br>
deteriorated and carbonized during molding.<br>
[0073]<br>
In the invention according to Claim 4, in the invention<br>
according to Claim 3, the additive for providing heat<br>
stability during molding contains at least one selected from<br>
the group consisting of lead-based stabilizers, organic tin-<br>
based stabilizers, higher fatty acid metal salts, and basic<br>
compounds in a total additive amount of 0.3 to 5.0 parts by<br>
weight based on 100 parts by weight of the polyvinyl<br>
chloride-based resin. Therefore, the deterioration and<br>
carbonization of the resin during molding can be prevented<br>
by suppressing the elimination reaction of hydrogen chloride<br>
from the polyvinyl chloride-based resin during molding by<br>
any of the following actions 1) to 4):<br>
1) capture and neutralization of hydrogen chloride;<br>
2) substitution with chlorine atoms;<br>
3) capture and inactivation of radicals; and<br>
4) isolation of conjugate double bond.<br>
Furthermore, since the lead-based stabilizers, organic<br>
tin-based stabilizers, and higher fatty acid metal salts are<br>
further excellent in heat stability during molding, compared<br>
to other additives that provide heat stability during<br>
molding, the product yield is high, and also the long-<br>
running continuous operation in extrusion molding is<br>
excellent.<br>
In addition, the lead-based stabilizers, the organic<br>
tin-based stabilizers, and the higher fatty acid metal salts<br>
provide high molding stability even if the amount thereof is<br>
small. Therefore, since the additive amounts of these<br>
additives, based on the amount of the polyvinyl chloride-<br>
based resin, may be smaller than those of other additives<br>
that provide heat stability during molding, the tensile<br>
strength and fire-resistance of a pipe are hardly decreased.<br>
[0074]<br>
In the invention according to Claim 5, in the invention<br>
according to Claim 4, a basic compound is further contained<br>
as the additive for providing heat stability during molding<br>
in a total additive amount of 0.3 to 5.0 parts by weight<br>
based on 100 parts by weight of the polyvinyl chloride-based<br>
resin. Therefore, the heat stability during molding and the<br>
tensile strength and fire-resistance of a pipe can be<br>
further reliably ensured.<br>
[0075]<br>
Since the single-layered fire-resistant piping material<br>
of the invention according to Claim 6 is constituted of a<br>
fire-resistant resin composition containing heat-expandable<br>
graphite having an expansion volume in the range of 100 to<br>
250 mL/g in an amount of 1 to 10 parts by weight based on<br>
100 parts by weight of the polyvinyl chloride-based resin,<br>
the heat-expandable graphite effectively expands during<br>
burning, and the piping material is excellent in maintaining<br>
the shape of the residue. Furthermore, the polyvinyl<br>
chloride-based resin repeats de-hydrochloric acid to<br>
accelerate carbonization of the polyvinyl chloride-based<br>
resin. As a result, strong residue is formed, and excellent<br>
effect of reducing the burning rate is obtained by the<br>
synergetic effect with the heat-expandable graphite.<br>
[0076]<br>
Since the single-layered fire-resistant piping material<br>
of the invention according to Claim 7 is constituted of a<br>
fire-resistant resin composition containing heat-expandable<br>
graphite having a 1.3-time expansion temperature of 180 to<br>
240°C in an amount of 1 to 10 parts by weight based on 100<br>
parts by weight of the polyvinyl chloride-based resin,<br>
melting/thermal decomposition (foaming) of the polyvinyl<br>
chloride-based resin do not progress even if the heat-<br>
expandable graphite has reached the 1.3-time expansion<br>
temperature, and the elongation viscosity of the polyvinyl<br>
chloride-based resin is maintained. Therefore, the<br>
polyvinyl chloride-based resin effectively extends according<br>
to the expansion of the heat-expandable graphite to form a<br>
fire-resistant expandable layer. Since the polyvinyl<br>
chloride-based resin is subsequently carbonized, highly<br>
excellent fire-resistance can be provided even if the amount<br>
of the heat-expandable graphite is small.<br>
[0077]<br>
In the single-layered fire-resistant piping material of<br>
the invention according to Claim 8, in the invention<br>
according to any one of Claims 1 to 7, when the piping<br>
material is constructed so as to pass through a flooring<br>
material and.is subjected to a fire-resistant test<br>
(complying with ISO 834-1) in which the underside of the<br>
floor is heated under the conditions that one end of the<br>
piping material is exposed to a heating side by 300 mm from<br>
the surface on the heating side of the flooring material and<br>
that the other end of the piping material is exposed to a<br>
non-heating side by 800 mm from the surface on the non-<br>
heating side of the flooring material, a pipe inner cross-<br>
sectional area SI at the end of the piping material before<br>
burning on the heating side and a pipe inner cross-sectional<br>
area S2 at a minimum inner diameter of the piping material<br>
after burning satisfy a relationship of (S2/Sl)xl00 
Therefore, the pipe inner cross-sectional area during<br>
burning becomes 50% or less of the pipe inner cross-<br>
sectional area Si before the burning.<br>
As a result, when the single-layered fire-resistant<br>
piping material of the present invention is installed so as<br>
to pass through the floor, even if the underside of the<br>
floor is heated to 1000°C or more, the residue does not drop<br>
from the underside of the floor so that a state that the<br>
pipe is almost caulked continues for a long period of time.<br>
That is, a reduction in the pipe inner cross-sectional area<br>
during burning can prevent heat from ascending in the pipe<br>
and suppress an increase in temperature of the piping<br>
material on the non-heating side with respect to the floor.<br>
Therefore, the piping material is inhibited from burning<br>
out, and smoke generation on the non-heating side, due to a<br>
gap with a mortar interface generated by softening of the<br>
piping material, can be prevented, resulting in improvements<br>
in flame shielding performance, heat shielding performance,<br>
and smoke shielding performance.<br>
[0078]<br>
Thus, the single-layered fire-resistant piping material<br>
of the invention according to any of Claims 1 to 8 has<br>
excellent fire-resistance and expansibility in itself and<br>
thereby can prevent flame and smoke from penetrating to the<br>
other side partitioned by the compartment pass-through<br>
portion by the expansion of the piping material itself<br>
during burning and the reduction in burning rate.<br>
Therefore, it is not necessary to dispose other fire-<br>
resistant member, which is necessary in the conventional<br>
way, around the piping material.<br>
Furthermore, processes such as marking for confirming<br>
positions are unnecessary in temporary pipe fitting during<br>
construction, and the single-layered fire-resistant piping<br>
material is simply inserted into the compartment pass-<br>
through portion. Consequently, the work is considerably<br>
reduced, and the workability in the construction site is<br>
dramatically improved.<br>
Furthermore, in the single-layered fire-resistant<br>
piping material of the present invention, the pipe outer<br>
diameter is smaller than that of a so-called fire-resistant<br>
double-layered pipe in which fiber-reinforced mortar covers<br>
the outer circumference of the pipe made of a vinyl chloride<br>
resin. Therefore, when a plurality of through-holes is<br>
provided, the distances among the through-holes can be<br>
small, and also when the pipe is installed under the floor,<br>
slope can be easily obtained. Thus, workability is<br>
dramatically improved.<br>
[0079]<br>
The multilayered fire-resistant piping material of the<br>
invention according to any of Claims 9 to 16 includes a<br>
covering layer formed of a polyvinyl chloride-based resin<br>
composition not containing heat-expandable graphite on at<br>
least one of the outer surface and the inner surface of the<br>
fire-resistant expandable layer. Therefore, in addition to<br>
the effects of the invention according to any of Claims 1 to<br>
8, the multilayered fire-resistant piping material is<br>
further excellent in the molding properties and can be<br>
continuously produced with high size accuracy by, for<br>
example, injection molding or extrusion molding.<br>
Furthermore, the fire-resistant expandable layer<br>
contains a polyvinyl chloride-based resin as a main<br>
component and thereby has sufficient mechanical strength and<br>
chemical proof necessary as a piping material.<br>
In addition, since the base resins of both the fire-<br>
resistant expandable layer and the covering layer<br>
constituting the piping material are polyvinyl chloride-<br>
based resins, the affinity between the layers is high.<br>
Therefore, the layers are tightly adhered to each other at<br>
the interface, resulting in providing of excellent water<br>
cutoff performance. Consequently, when the multilayered<br>
fire-resistant piping materials of the present invention are<br>
connected to each other with a pipe joint, the treatment of<br>
the end of the piping material is unnecessary, resulting in<br>
dramatic improvement in construction workability.<br>
When the outer surface of the fire-resistant expandable<br>
layer is covered with a covering layer formed of a polyvinyl<br>
chloride-based resin composition not containing a heat-<br>
expandable fire-resistant material, the outer circumference<br>
surface of the piping material is excellent in adhesion and,<br>
for example, can be easily and reliably connected to another<br>
member such as a pipe joint.<br>
When the inner surface of the fire-resistant expandable<br>
layer is covered with a covering layer formed of polyvinyl<br>
chloride-based resin composition not containing a heat-<br>
expandable fire-resistant material, the inner circumference<br>
surface of the piping material is smooth to allow fluid to<br>
smoothly pass. In addition, since the inner circumference<br>
surface of the piping material is excellent in chemical<br>
proof, the piping material hardly limits the type of fluid,<br>
which allows general purpose application.<br>
[0080]<br>
Since the multilayered fire-resistant piping material<br>
of the invention according to Claim 17, in the invention<br>
according to any one of Claims 9 to 16, includes the<br>
covering layer on each of the outer surface and the inner<br>
surface of the fire-resistant expandable layer, the outer<br>
circumference surface of the piping material is excellent in<br>
adhesion and, for example, can be easily and reliably<br>
connected to another member such as a pipe joint, and also<br>
the inner circumference surface of the piping material is<br>
excellent in chemical proof, and thereby the piping material<br>
hardly limits the type of fluid, which allows general<br>
purpose application.<br>

[0094]<br>
Then, the resulting resin composition was extrusion<br>
molded with a generally used extruder to a test piping<br>
material P to be used for fire-resistance evaluation. The<br>
resin temperature during molding for those that are not<br>
shown in the Tables was 190°C.<br>
The test piping material P was formed so as to have a<br>
length of 1200 mm, an outer diameter of 114 mm, a thickness<br>
of 6.6 mm, and a nominal diameter of 100 mm. The<br>
thicknesses of the fire-resistant expandable layer 11, the<br>
inner side covering layer 12, and the outer side covering<br>
layer 13 were adjusted to those shown in Tables 15 to 20.<br>
Furthermore, test pieces to be used for performance<br>
evaluation and heat expansibility evaluation were produced<br>
from the test piping material P by cutting out a part of the<br>
pipe wall of the test piping material P, press-molding the<br>
cut-out pipe wall with a load of 200 kgf at 190°C for 3<br>
minutes to a press plate having a thickness of 3 mm, and<br>
cutting the press plate into 1-cm square pieces.<br>
[0095]<br>
Fire-resistance evaluation<br>
A fire-resistance test (an evaluation method of fire-<br>
resistance performance test of the revised Building<br>
Standards Act in force on June 1, 2000 (Heisei 12),<br>
complying with ISO 834-1) was performed using the fire-<br>
resistant test furnace X shown in Fig. 5.<br>
As the floor material Y, a precast concrete plate<br>
(length: 1200 mm, width: 600 mm, thickness: 100 mm) was<br>
used. As the fireproof construction method, the gap between<br>
the test piping material P and the compartment pass-through<br>
portion R was caulked with mortar.<br>
Furthermore, one end of the test piping material P was<br>
exposed to the heating side by 300 mm from the surface on<br>
the heating side of the flooring material Y, and the other<br>
end of the test piping material P was exposed to the non-<br>
heating side by 800 mm from the surface on the non-heating<br>
side of the flooring material Y.<br>
The inner side wall of the heating chamber Z of the<br>
fire-resistant test furnace X was provided with burners V,<br>
V. In addition, in the inside of the heating chamber Z, two<br>
hot junctions of a furnace thermocouple Q were installed at<br>
positions apart from the flooring material Y by 300 mm so as<br>
to be evenly arranged with respect to the test surface of<br>
the flooring material. Furthermore, the fire-resistant test<br>
furnace X was equipped with an apparatus (not shown) for<br>
measuring pressure in the furnace.<br>
The period of time (smoke-generating time) after the<br>
start of heating until the appearance of smoke from the gap<br>
between the compartment pass-through portion R and the test<br>
piping material P was measured. The appearance of smoke was<br>
visually determined. A test piece of which smoke-generating<br>
time was 130 minutes or more was determined as ®<br>
(excellent), a test piece of 120 minutes or more was<br>
determined as O (acceptance) , a test piece of 75 minutes or<br>
more was determined as A; and a test piece of shorter than<br>
75 minutes was determined as x (rejection).<br>
The pipe inner cross-sectional area proportion was<br>
determined as follows:<br>
First, the fire-resistant test furnace X was heated so<br>
that the temporal change in heating temperature could be<br>
expressed by a numerical value represented by the<br>
aforementioned Expression 1.<br>
Then, the burning of the test piping material P was<br>
visually observed through the observation window G, and when<br>
smoke was observed from the gap between the compartment<br>
pass-through portion R and the test piping material P, the<br>
burning of the fire-resistant test furnace X was terminated.<br>
Then, the degree of caulking of the inside of the test<br>
piping material P after burning was calculated as the pipe<br>
inner cross-sectional area proportion after burning by the<br>
following calculation expression using a pipe inner cross-<br>
sectional area SI at the end of the test piping material P,<br>
before burning, on the heating side as shown in Fig. 6 and a<br>
pipe inner cross-sectional area S2 at a minimum inner<br>
diameter of the test piping material P after burning as<br>
shown in Fig. 7.<br>
Pipe inner cross-sectional area proportion after<br>
burning = (S2/Sl)xl00.<br>
Herein, the pipe inner cross-sectional area SI was<br>
determined by measuring inner diameters of a piping material<br>
in two directions (orthogonal to each other) before the<br>
start of the fire-resistance test and calculating the<br>
average inner diameter.<br>
Regarding the pipe inner cross-sectional area S2 at a<br>
minimum inner diameter of the piping material after burning,<br>
when smoke appeared on the non-heating side from the gap<br>
between the compartment pass-through portion and the piping<br>
material after the starting of the fire-resistant test, the<br>
burning of the fire-resistant test furnace was terminated,<br>
and then the flooring material panel was immediately removed<br>
from the fire-resistant furnace. After cooling the pipe,<br>
the caulked pipe was observed from the heating side to<br>
determine the projected area as the S2.<br>
In the measurement of S2, the minimum inner diameter<br>
portion in the pipe was sketched on a pape.r from a<br>
photograph taken from the heating side, the sketched portion<br>
was cut out and measured the weight thereof, and the S2 was<br>
proportionally calculated on the basis of the weight and the<br>
area of the paper that were already known.<br>
Regarding the elongated length L of the residue, when<br>
smoke appeared on the non-heating side from the gap between<br>
the compartment pass-through portion and the piping material<br>
after the start of the fire-resistant test, the burning of<br>
the fire-resistant test furnace was terminated, and then the<br>
flooring material panel was immediately removed from the<br>
fire-resistant furnace. After cooling of the pipe, the<br>
elongated length L orthogonal to the surface on the heating-<br>
side of the flooring material was measured.<br>
When no smoke was observed for 2 hours, the fire-<br>
resistant test was terminated after 2 hours, and the pipe<br>
inner cross-sectional area S2 and the elongated length L of<br>
the residue were measured by the above-mentioned processes.<br>
[0096]<br>
Performance evaluation<br>
The resulting test pieces were subjected to a tensile<br>
test (evaluation temperature: 23°C) regulated in JIS K7113<br>
for determining whether performance required as a pipe is<br>
satisfied.<br>
In order to determine whether practical performance<br>
required as a pipe is satisfied, a test piece having a<br>
tensile strength of 45 MPa or more at 23°C was determined as<br>
® (excellent), a test piece of 30 MPa or more was determined<br>
as O (acceptance), and a test piece of less than 30 MPa was<br>
determined as x (rejection).<br>
[0097]<br>
Molding property evaluation<br>
A sample that could be extrusion molded and had a<br>
satisfactory pipe appearance in appearance visual<br>
observation was determined as O (acceptance), and a sample<br>
that could not be extrusion molded was determined as x<br>
(rejection). A sample that had abnormality in pipe<br>
appearance was determined as A-<br>
[0098]<br>
Apparatus corrosive evaluation<br>
After conducted manufacturing for three hours, the<br>
apparatus was left for three days. Then, the metal hopper<br>
portion of the raw material feeding portion was visually<br>
observed for investigating the degree of corrosion. When no<br>
abnormality was observed, it was determined as O<br>
(acceptance), and when red rust was observed, it was<br>
determined as x (rejection).<br>
[0099]<br>
Extrusion molding stability evaluation<br>
During continuous operation for three hours, the resin<br>
composition discharged from the tip of an extruder was<br>
visually confirmed. A case of no carbonization and no<br>
burning (yellowing), it was determined as ® (excellent), a<br>
case of no carbonization, it was determined as O<br>
(acceptance), and a case of carbonization, it was determined<br>
as x (rejection).<br>
[0100]<br>
Heat expansibility evaluation<br>
The test pieces were subjected to a fire-resistant<br>
test. The test was performed by, first, putting the test<br>
pieces in an electric furnace heated to 500°C, leaving them<br>
for 40 minutes, then taking out the test pieces from the<br>
furnace and cooling them, and then measuring the thicknesses<br>
of the test pieces.<br>
When the thickness (thickness after expansion) of a<br>
test piece after the fire-resistant test was 4 mm or more,<br>
the test piece was accepted, and when the thickness was<br>
smaller than 4 mm, the test piece was rejected.<br>
[0101]<br>
[0104]<br>
Experimental results<br>
As shown in Table 1, since heat-expandable graphite was<br>
not used in Comparative Examples 1 and 3, the smoke-<br>
generating time was short, and thereby the samples were<br>
rejected in the fire-resistance evaluation. In Comparative<br>
Example 2, since the blending ratio of heat-expandable<br>
graphite was too large, the smoke-generating time was short,<br>
and thereby the sample was rejected in the fire-resistance<br>
evaluation.<br>
Furthermore, as shown in Table 3, since heat-expandable<br>
graphite was not used in Comparative Example 4, the smoke-<br>
generating time was short, and thereby the sample was<br>
rejected in the fire-resistance evaluation. In Comparative<br>
Example 5, since the blending ratio of heat-expandable<br>
graphite was too large, the smoke-generating time did not<br>
reach 120 minutes.<br>
Therefore, it was well confirmed that in order to<br>
obtain a single-layered fire-resistant piping material that<br>
satisfies all the fire-resistance evaluation, performance<br>
evaluation, and molding property evaluation requirements,<br>
heat-expandable graphite is required to be contained in the<br>
range of 1 to 10 parts by weight based on 100 parts by<br>
weight of the vinyl chloride resin.<br>
Furthermore, samples in Examples 4 and 5 in Table 2<br>
were further excellent than those in Examples 3 and 6 to 10<br>
in fire-resistance and tensile strength. Therefore, it was<br>
confirmed that when a single-layered fire-resistant piping<br>
material contains heat-expandable graphite and also an<br>
inorganic filler in the ranges of 1 to 10 parts by weight<br>
and 2 to 5 parts by weight, respectively, based on 100 parts<br>
by weight of the vinyl chloride resin, a pipe being further<br>
well-balanced in any of the fire-resistance, tensile<br>
strength, and molding properties can be obtained.<br>
Incidentally, when the amount of the heat-expandable<br>
graphite was larger than 10 parts by weight, the heated<br>
composition was thermally expanded too much to maintain the<br>
shape, resulting in dropping of the residue 2, as shown in<br>
Fig. 8.<br>
[0111]<br>
Experimental results<br>
As shown in Table 4, in Comparative Examples 6 and 7,<br>
since the acidity of heat-expandable graphite was too<br>
strong, corrosion was observed in the apparatus. In<br>
Comparative Examples 8 and 9, the acidity of heat-expandable<br>
graphite was too weak, and therefore the carbonization of<br>
the vinyl chloride resin during burning was hardly<br>
accelerated, resulting in that a smoke-generating time of<br>
120 minutes was not achieved in the fire-resistance<br>
evaluation.<br>
It was confirmed from these results that in order to<br>
exhibit excellent fire resistance without causing corrosion<br>
of apparatus, the pH of heat-expandable graphite is required<br>
to be in the range of 1.5 to 4.0.<br>
As shown in Table 5, in Comparative Examples 10 and 11,<br>
since the blending ratio of heat-expandable graphite was too<br>
small, a smoke-generating time of 120 minutes was not<br>
achieved in the fire-resistance evaluation. On the other<br>
hand, in Comparative Examples 12 and 13, since the blending<br>
ratio of heat-expandable graphite was too large, a smoke-<br>
generating time of 120 minutes was not achieved in the fire-<br>
resistance evaluation.<br>
It was confirmed from these results that in order to<br>
obtain excellent fire resistance while strength necessary as<br>
a pipe is maintained, the heat-expandable graphite is<br>
required to have a pH of 1.5 to 4.0 and is contained in an<br>
amount of 1 to 10 parts by weight based on 100 parts by<br>
weight of the vinyl chloride resin. Furthermore, when the<br>
amount of the heat-expandable graphite was larger than 10<br>
parts by weight, the heated composition was thermally<br>
expanded too much to maintain the shape, resulting in<br>
dropping of the residue 2, as shown in Fig. 8.<br>
As shown in Table 6, in Example 31, since the additive<br>
amount of the stabilizer is too large, the tensile strength<br>
was lower than those in Examples 2 6 to 30.<br>
As shown in Table 7, in Example 34, epoxidized soybean<br>
oil was blended as an additive for providing heat stability<br>
during molding. Epoxidized soybean oil does not have high<br>
ability of providing heat stability during molding, but has<br>
high effect of plasticization. As a result, the sample of<br>
Example 34 was rejected in the extrusion molding stability<br>
and was also slightly reduced in tensile strength and fire<br>
resistance, compared to those in other Examples shown in<br>
Table 7.<br>
It was confirmed from these results that in order to<br>
obtain a pipe that is excellent in tensile strength and fire<br>
resistance and also excellent in molding stability, it is<br>
preferred that at least one selected from the group<br>
consisting of lead-based stabilizers, organic tin-based<br>
stabilizers, and higher fatty acid metal salts be contained<br>
as the additive for providing heat stability during molding<br>
in a total additive amount of 0.3 to 5.0 parts by weight<br>
based on 100 parts by weight of the polyvinyl chloride-based<br>
resin.<br>
As shown in Table 8, in Example 35, since calcium<br>
carbonate serving as a basic compound was not contained, the<br>
extrusion molding stability was slightly lower than those in<br>
other Examples shown in Table 8. On the other hand, in<br>
Example 39, the additive amount of calcium carbonate serving<br>
as a basic compound was too large, and thereby the tensile<br>
strength was slightly lower than those in other Examples<br>
shown in Table 8.<br>
As shown in Table 9, in Example 41, no stabilizer was<br>
blended as the additive for providing heat stability during<br>
molding, and only hydrotalcite was blended. Though<br>
hydrotalcite has an ability of providing heat stability,<br>
sufficient heat stability cannot be achieved by hydrotalcite<br>
alone. Consequently, the sample was rejected in the<br>
extrusion molding stability.<br>
It was confirmed from these results that in order to<br>
obtain a pipe that is excellent in tensile strength and fire<br>
resistance and also excellent in molding stability, it is<br>
further preferred that each of a stabilizer as the additive<br>
for providing heat stability during molding and a basic<br>
compound be contained in an amount of 0.3 to 5.0 parts by<br>
weight based on 100 parts by weight of the vinyl chloride<br>
resin.<br>
[0116]<br>
Experimental results<br>
As shown in Tables 11 and 13, in Comparative Examples<br>
16 and 19, since heat-expandable graphite was not blended at<br>
all, the.piping material burned out. As a result, the<br>
increase in temperature of the piping material was rapid on<br>
the heating- side, and thereby the smoke-generating time was<br>
short.<br>
In Comparative Examples 17 and 20, since the blended<br>
amount of the heat-expandable graphite was too large, the<br>
piping material could not maintain the shape thereof after<br>
expansion, and dropped. As a result, the temperature of the<br>
piping material was rapidly increased on the heating side,<br>
and thereby the smoke-generating time was short.<br>
Furthermore, when the amount of the heat-expandable<br>
graphite was larger than 10 parts by weight, the heated<br>
composition was thermally expanded too much to maintain the<br>
shape, resulted in dropping of the residue, as shown in Fig.<br>
8.<br>
Therefore, it was well confirmed that in order to<br>
obtain a single-layered fire-resistant piping material that<br>
satisfies all the heat expansibility evaluation, performance<br>
evaluation, and fire-resistance evaluation requirements, the<br>
heat-expandable graphite is required to have an expansion<br>
volume of 100 to 250 mL/g and to be contained in the range<br>
<br>
of 1 to 10 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of<br>
the vinyl chloride resin.<br>
Furthermore, in Examples 42 to 70, not only the tensile<br>
strength necessary as a pipe was achieved, but also the<br>
smoke-generating time was drastically elongated, compared to<br>
those in Comparative Examples. This may be caused by that<br>
in Examples 42 to 70, the pipe inner cross-section was<br>
caulked with the residue to inhibit an increase in<br>
temperature of the pipe.<br>
Furthermore, in Examples 59 and 60, not only the pipe<br>
inner cross-sectional area proportion but also the elongated<br>
length L of the residue H was excellent, compared to those<br>
in Examples 58 and 61. In Examples 63 and 64, not only the<br>
pipe inner cross-sectional area proportion but also the<br>
elongated length L of the residue H was excellent, compared<br>
to those in Examples 62 and 65. In addition, in Examples 67<br>
to 69, not only the pipe inner cross-sectional area<br>
proportion but also the elongated length L of the residue H<br>
was excellent, compared to those in Examples 66 and 70. As<br>
a result, in these Examples, the smoke-generating time was<br>
further improved compared to other Examples.<br>
[0117]<br>
Incidentally, when a synthetic resin piping material<br>
constructed so as to pass through a floor material is heated<br>
from the underside of the floor, first, the portion of the<br>
piping material protruding below the floor is directly<br>
heated to start softening and burning. Then, a difference<br>
in hardness occurs between the portion lying inside the<br>
composition and the burning portion of the floor piping<br>
material, causing sharp softening. Then, the portion of the<br>
piping material protruding below the f.loor falls apart from<br>
the floor and drops (falls away) about 5 to 20 minutes after<br>
the start of the burning. The bottom surface of the<br>
remaining piping material is in nearly the same plane as the<br>
bottom surface of the floor. When the heat is further<br>
applied, the phenomena vary depending on the blending<br>
composition of the piping material.<br>
Specifically, in the piping material composed of the<br>
composition shown in Comparative Example 19, as shown in<br>
Fig. 9, after the portion protruding below the floor<br>
dropped, the resin run down to once caulk the end on the<br>
heating side. However, since no heat-expandable graphite<br>
was blended, fire resistance was not obtained, and the end<br>
of the piping material on the heating side dropped after<br>
all. As a result, hot air flowed in the inside of the pass-<br>
through portion of the piping material, and the potion<br>
inside the floor structure burned out to generate smoke on<br>
the non-heating side.<br>
Since the piping material composed of the composition<br>
shown in Comparative Example 20 contained a large amount of<br>
<br>
heat-expandable graphite, the heated composition was<br>
expanded too much to maintain the shape, resulting in<br>
dropping.<br>
[0118]<br>
On the other hand, in the piping materials composed of<br>
compositions shown in Examples 66 to 70, as shown in Fig.<br>
10, after the portion protruding below the floor dropped,<br>
the remaining portion was softened from the lower part by<br>
being heated, and the inner diameter slightly shrank in the<br>
direction in which the pipe contracts. Then, the heat-<br>
expandable graphite started expanding by heating. The<br>
expansion continued in the central direction of the pipe<br>
cross-section till that the pipe inner cross-sectional area<br>
after burning became 50% or less of the pipe inner cross-<br>
sectional area before the burning. The residue after the<br>
expansion was thought that the main component thereof was a<br>
graphite crystal, which gives a very strong, flame-retardant<br>
residue H extending from the underside of the floor to the<br>
heating side and can prevent itself from dropping and<br>
burning. As a result, even though the underside of the<br>
floor was heated to 1000°C or higher, the residue H did not<br>
drop from the underside of the floor, and a state of almost<br>
caulking the pipe continued for a long period of time. In<br>
addition, since the pipe inner cross-sectional area was<br>
reduced during burning and also the residue extended to the<br>
heating side, hot air was prevented from ascending inside<br>
the pipe and an increase in temperature of the piping<br>
material on the non-heating side with respect to the floor<br>
surface could be suppressed. As a result, the piping<br>
material was prevented from burning out, and also smoke<br>
generation on the non-heating side, which is caused.by<br>
softening of the piping material to form a gap with the<br>
mortar interface, was prevented.<br>
[0119]<br>
Therefore, it was confirmed that in order to obtain a<br>
single-layered fire-resistant piping material that satisfies<br>
all the strength as a pipe, stability during molding, and<br>
caulking of the end on the heating side of the pipe during<br>
heating, it is necessary that heat-expandable graphite<br>
having an expansion volume in the range of 100 to 250 mL/g<br>
is contained in an amount of 1 to 10 parts by weight based<br>
on 100 parts by weight of the vinyl chloride resin.<br>
Furthermore, it was confirmed that further preferred<br>
blending ratios are, based on 100 parts by weight of the<br>
vinyl chloride resin, 4 to 7 parts by weight of the heat-<br>
expandable graphite having an expansion volume in the range<br>
of 100 to 250 mL/g, 1 to 5 parts by weight of calcium<br>
carbonate serving as the inorganic filler, and 0.3 to 5<br>
parts by weight of the stabilizer.<br>
[0121]<br>
Experimental results<br>
It was confirmed that in order to provide strength<br>
necessary as a pipe and to exhibit excellent fire<br>
resistance, it is necessary that the heat-expandable<br>
graphite having a 1.3-time expansion temperature T3 of 180<br>
to 240°C is contained in an amount of 1 to 10 parts by<br>
weight based on 100 parts by weight of the vinyl chloride<br>
resin.<br>
When the amount of the heat-expandable graphite was<br>
larger than 10 parts by weight, the heated composition was<br>
thermally expanded too much to maintain the shape, resulting<br>
in dropping of the residue 2, as shown in Fig. 8.<br>
[0127]<br>
Experimental results<br>
As shown in Tables 15 to 19, in Comparative Examples 23<br>
to 28 and 30, the smoke-generating time was short, and the<br>
samples were rejected in the fire-resistance evaluation. In<br>
addition, in Comparative Example 29, the tensile strength<br>
was slightly low. Therefore, in order to obtain a<br>
multilayered fire-resistant piping material that satisfies<br>
both the fire-resistance evaluation and performance<br>
evaluation requirements, it is necessary, as shown in<br>
Examples 76 to 90, that the material include a tubular fire-<br>
resistant expandable layer composed of a heat-expandable<br>
fire-resistant resin composition and a covering layer<br>
covering at least one of the outer surface and the inner<br>
surface of the fire-resistant expandable layer, the fire-<br>
resistant expandable layer is formed of a fire-resistant<br>
resin composition containing heat-expandable graphite in an<br>
amount of 1 to 15 parts by weight based on 100 parts by<br>
weight of the vinyl chloride resin, and the covering layer<br>
is formed of a vinyl chloride resin composition not<br>
containing heat-expandable fire-resistant materials.<br>
When the amount of the heat-expandable graphite was<br>
larger than 15 parts by weight, the heated test piping<br>
material P was thermally expanded too much to maintain the<br>
shape, resulting in dropping of the residue, as shown in<br>
Fig. 8.<br>
[0129]<br>
Experimental results<br>
As shown in Table 20, in Comparative Example 31, the<br>
smoke-generating time was very short, compared to those in<br>
Examples 99 to 101, and the sample was rejected in the fire-<br>
resistance evaluation.<br>
In Examples 102 and 106, the smoke-generating time was<br>
slightly short, and the samples were slightly inferior in<br>
the fire-resistance evaluation, compared to those in<br>
Examples 100, 103, 104, and 105.<br>
Therefore, it was confirmed that in order to satisfy<br>
both the fire-resistance evaluation and performance<br>
evaluation requirements, it is preferable that the fire-<br>
resistant expandable layer 11 is formed of a fire-resistant<br>
resin composition containing heat-expandable graphite having<br>
a 1.3-time expansion temperature in the range of 180 to<br>
240°C in an amount of 5 to 15 parts by weight based on 100<br>
parts by weight of the polyvinyl chloride-based resin.<br>
[0131]<br>
Experimental results<br>
As shown in Table 21, in Example 112, since the<br>
thicknesses of the inner side covering layer 12 and the<br>
outer side covering layer 13 were each extremely thin, 0.1<br>
mm, the tensile strength was slightly inferior, compared to ,<br>
those in other Examples. On the other hand, in Example 113,<br>
since the thicknesses of the inner side covering layer 12<br>
and the outer side covering layer 13 were each extremely<br>
thick, 2.2 mm, the fire resistance was slightly inferior,<br>
compared to those in other Examples.<br>
Therefore, it was confirmed that it is preferable that<br>
the thicknesses of the inner side covering layer 12 and the<br>
outer side covering layer 13 each be in the range of 0.2 to<br>
2.0 mm.<br>
[0133]<br>
Experimental results<br>
As shown in Table 22, in Comparative Example 32, since<br>
the resin temperature during molding was too low, the<br>
tensile strength was slightly inferior. Furthermore, in<br>
Comparative Example 33, since the resin temperature during<br>
molding was too high, the tensile strength was slightly<br>
inferior. Therefore, it is preferable that the resin<br>
temperature during molding of the resin composition be 170<br>
to 210°C.<br>
[0135]<br>
Experimental results<br>
As shown in Table 23, in Comparative Example 23, since<br>
the 1.3-time expansion temperature of the heat-expandable<br>
graphite was lower than the resin temperature during molding<br>
by 10°C, the tensile strength was lower than those in<br>
Examples 117 to 120. Furthermore, in Example 120, since the<br>
1.3-time expansion temperature of the heat-expandable<br>
graphite was higher than 240°C, the smoke-generating time<br>
was slightly short, and the tensile strength was slightly<br>
inferior, compared to those in Examples 117 to 119.<br>
Therefore, it was confirmed that it is preferable that<br>
the resin temperature during molding be lower than the 1.3-<br>
time expansion temperature of heat-expandable graphite by<br>
5°C and be in 170 to 210°C.<br>
[0136]<br>
Conclusion<br>
As described in detail with reference to Examples in<br>
the above, in the single-layered fire-resistant piping<br>
material and the multilayered fire-resistant piping material<br>
according to the present invention, each layer constituted<br>
of a fire-resistant resin composition effectively expands<br>
during burning, and, as shown in Fig. 11, the residue caulks<br>
the gap between the piping material and the compartment<br>
pass-through portion and the inside of the piping material<br>
to prevent flame and smoke from penetrating to the other<br>
side partitioned by the floor material. The piping<br>
materials are thus excellent in fire resistance and also<br>
excellent in molding properties and have mechanical strength<br>
sufficient as pipes.<br>
Furthermore, unlike a piping structure in which only<br>
the compartment pass-through portion is subjected to fire-<br>
resistant treatment with a conventional fire-resistant<br>
expandable sheet-like covering material, the present<br>
invention can impart fire resistance to the entire piping.<br>
In the present fire-resistance evaluation, the fire<br>
resistance was compared by an alternative evaluation<br>
technique in which heating is conducted under a condition<br>
that one end of a piping material protrudes in a fire-<br>
resistant furnace by 300 mm. In the case of a fire under a<br>
condition that the piping material of the present invention<br>
is practically constructed in a building so as to pass<br>
through each slab of every floor or each partition wall of<br>
every floor, the difference in fire resistance may be<br>
further distinguished.<br>
That is, the piping material of the present invention<br>
rapidly and reliably caulks the compartment pass-through<br>
portion during burning, and also the entire pipe can undergo<br>
burning for a long period of time. Even if the piping<br>
material partially dropped during burning, it is suggested<br>
that the opening portion of the piping material is quickly-<br>
caulked to maintain the shape, and thereby flame and smoke<br>
hardly penetrate to the outside of the burning chamber,<br>
resulting in prevention of the fire from spreading.<br>
Furthermore, in the multilayered fire-resistant piping<br>
material having an inner side covering layer, the inner<br>
circumference surface of the piping material is smooth and<br>
thereby can allow fluid to smoothly pass, and also the inner<br>
circumference surface of the piping material is excellent in<br>
chemical proof and thereby hardly limits the type of fluid,<br>
which allows general purpose application.<br>
In addition, in the multilayered fire-resistant piping<br>
material having an outer side covering layer, the outer<br>
circumference surface of the piping material is excellent in<br>
adhesion and, for example, can be easily and reliably<br>
connected to another member such as a pipe joint.<br>
[0137]<br>
Furthermore, the multilayered fire-resistant piping<br>
material of the present invention is not limited to the<br>
above-described Examples. For example, in the Examples, the<br>
piping materials have a nominal diameter of 100 mm, but may<br>
have a nominal diameter different therefrom.<br>
