				<td>Description	<br>
The present invention relates to a process for preparing substituted biphenyls of the<br>
formula I<br><br>
in which the substituents are definecfas foilows:<br>
R1 is nitro, amino or NHR3,<br>
R2 is cyano, nitro, halogen, C1-C6-alkyl, C2-C6-alkenyl, C2-C6-alkynyl, C1-C6-alkoxy,<br>
C1-C6-haloalkyl, (C1-C6-alkyl)carbonyl or phenyl,<br>
R3 is C1-C4-alkyl, C2-C4-alkenyl or C2-C4-alkynyl,<br>
m is 1 or 2, where, in the case that m = 2, the two R1 radicals may have different<br>
definitions,<br>
n is 0, 1, 2 or 3, where, in the case that n = 2 or 3, the two R2 radicals may have<br>
different definitions,<br>
which comprises reacting a compound of the formula II<br><br>
in which Hal is halogen and R1 and m are each as defined above, in the presence of a<br>
base and of a palladium catalyst selected from the group of: a) palladium-<br>
triarylphosphine or -trialkylphosphine complex with palladium in the zero oxidation<br>
state, b) salt of palladium in the presence of triarylphospine or trialkylphosphine as a<br>
complex ligand or c) metallic palladium applied to support if appropriate,<br>
in the presence of triarylphosphine or trialkylphosphine, in a solvent, with a<br>
diphenylborinic acid (III)<br><br><br>
in which R2 and n are each as defined above, where the triarylphosphines or<br>
trialkylphosphines used may be substituted.<br>
Tetrahedron Lett. 32, page 2277 (1991) states that the coupling reaction between<br>
phenylboronic acid and chlorobenzene with use of the [1,4-bis(diphenylphosphine)-<br>
butane]palladium(II) dichloride catalyst proceeds with a yield of only 28%.<br>
EP-A 0 888 261 discloses a process for preparing nitrobiphenyls by reacting<br>
chloronitrobenzenes with a phenylboronic acid in the presence of a palladium catalyst<br>
and of a base. In this process, a very high catalyst concentration is necessary.<br>
It was therefore an object of the present invention to provide an economically viable<br>
process which can be implemented on the industrial scale for regioselectively preparing<br>
substituted biphenyls, which works with a reduced palladium catalyst concentration.<br>
Accordingly, the process defined at the outset has been found.<br>
The diphenylborinic acid (III) is obtained by reaction of optionally substituted<br>
phenylmagnesium chloride V with trialkyl borate, preferably trimethyl borate, in<br>
tetrahydrofuran as a solvent according to scheme 1 which follows.<br><br>
Essential for a high yield of diphenylborinic acid (III) is the use of only 0.7 eq. of trialkyl<br>
borate based on the chlorobenzene (IV) used. Use of about 1.1 eq. of trialkyl borate<br>
gives rise to phenylboronic acid as described in EP-A 0 888 261.<br>
This reduction in the trialkyl borate use has several surprising advantages in relation to<br>
the preparation of nitrobiphenyls (I). The space-time yield is increased. The feedstock<br><br>
costs are lowered as a result of reduction in the amount of expensive trimethyl borate.<br>
Unlike the phenylboronic acids used in EP-A 0 888 261, the diphenylborinic acids (III)<br>
are soluble in tetrahydrofuran, which leads to an improvement in heat removal during '<br>
the reaction, which is accompanied by lower consumption of the cooling capacity. This<br>
leads in turn to higher process safety.<br>
The reaction temperature in this process stage is from 10 to 30°C, preferably from 15<br>
to 25°C.<br>
The substituted biphenyls prepared by the present process have the following preferred<br>
substituents:<br>
R1 nitro, amino, methylamino, propylamino, butylamino, allylamino or propargyl-<br>
amino,<br>
more preferably nitro, amino or methylamino,<br>
most preferably nitro or amino;<br>
R2 cyano, nitro, fluorine, chlorine, bromine, methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, aliyl,<br>
propargyl, methoxy, ethoxy, trifluoromethyl or phenyl,<br>
more preferably fluorine, chlorine, methyl or methoxy,<br>
most preferably fluorine or chlorine;<br>
R3 methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, allyl or propargyl,<br>
more preferably methyl, ethyl or allyl,<br>
most preferably methyl;<br>
m 1;<br>
n 0,1 or 2, preferably 0 or 1, most preferably 1.<br>
The subsequent homogeneously catalyzed Suzuki biaryl cross-coupling is carried out<br>
according to scheme 2..<br><br><br>
Preference is given to starting from diphenylborinic acids of the formula (III) in which R2<br>
and n are each as defined above.<br>
Further preferred starting materials are diphenyiborinic acids (III) in which n is 0 or 1<br>
and is in particular 1.<br>
Very particular preference is given to di(4-methylphenyl)borinic acid, di(4-fluorophenyl)-<br>
borinic acid and in particular di(4-chlorophenyl)borinic acid as the starting compound<br>
(III).<br>
Preference is given to starting from compounds (II) which bear a single nitro or amino<br>
group (m = 1), especially 4-nitrochlorobenzene or 4-aminochlorobenzene and in<br>
particular 2-nitrochIorobenzene or 2-aminochlorobenzene.<br>
The compound (II) is used, based on the diphenyiborinic acids (III) (diphenyiborinic<br>
acid equivalents), normally in an equimolar amount, preferably with an up to 20 percent<br>
excess, preferably with an up to 50 percent excess.<br>
The bases used may be organic bases, for example tertiary amines. Preference is<br>
given to using, for example, triethylamine or dimethylcyclohexylamine.<br>
The bases used are preferably alkali metal hydroxides, alkaline earth metal hydroxides,<br>
alkali metal carbonates, alkaline earth metal carbonates, alkali metal hydrogen-<br>
carbonates, alkali metal acetates, alkaline earth metal acetates, alkali metal alkoxides<br>
and alkaline earth metal alkoxides, in a mixture and in particular individually.<br>
Particularly preferred bases are alkali metal hydroxides, alkaline earth metal<br>
hydroxides, alkali metal carbonates, alkaline earth metal carbonates and alkali metal<br>
hydrogencarbonates.<br><br>
Especially preferred bases are alkali metal hydroxides, e.g. sodium hydroxide and<br>
potassium hydroxide, and also alkali metal carbonates and alkali metal<br>
hydrogencarbonates, e.g. lithium carbonate, sodium carbonate and potassium<br>
carbonate.<br>
The base is used in the process according to the invention preferably with a fraction of<br>
from 100 to 500 mol%, more preferably from 150 to 400 mol%, based on the<br>
diphenylborinic acids (III).<br>
Suitable palladium catalysts are paliadium-ligand complexes with palladium in the zero<br>
oxidation state, salts of palladium in the presence of complex ligands, or metallic<br>
palladium applied to support if appropriate,preferably in the presence of complex ligands.<br>
Suitable complex ligands are uncharged ligands such as triarylphosphines and<br>
trialkylphosphines, which may optionally be substituted in the aryl rings, such as<br>
triphenyiphosphine (TPP), di-1-adamantyl-n-butylphosphine, tri-tert-butylphosphine<br>
(TtBP) or 2-(dicyclohexylphosphino)biphenyl.<br>
Furthermore, the literature has also described further particularly reactive complex<br>
ligands from other structural classes, including 1,3-bis(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)-4,5-H2-<br>
imidazolium chloride (cf., for example, G. A. Grasa et al., Organometallics 2002, 21,<br>
2866) and tris(2,4-di-tert-butylphenyl) phosphite (cf. A. Zapf et al., Chem. Eur. J. 2000,<br>
6, 1830).<br>
The reactivity of the complex ligands can be enhanced by adding a quaternary<br>
ammonium salt such as tetra-n-butylammonium bromide (TBAB) (cf., for example,<br>
D. Zim et al., Tetrahedron Lett. 2000, 41, 8199).<br>
If required, the water solubility of the palladium complexes can be improved by various<br>
substituents such as sulfonic acid or sulfonate salt groups, carboxylic acid or<br>
carboxylate salt groups, phosphonic acid, phosphonium or phosphonate salt groups,<br>
peralkylammonium, hydroxyl and polyether groups.<br>
Among the paliadium-ligand complexes with palladium in the 0 oxidation state,<br>
preference is given to using tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium and additionally<br>
tetrakis[tri(o-tolyl)phosphine]palladium.<br>
In the salts of palladium which are used in the presence of complex ligands, the<br>
palladium is normally present in the two positive oxidation state. Preference is given to<br>
using palladium chloride, palladium acetate or bisacetonitrilepalladium chloride.<br>
Particular preference is given to using palladium chloride.<br><br>
In general, from 6 to 60, preferably from 15 to 25, equivalents of the aforementioned<br>
complex ligands, in particular triphenylphosphine and tri-tert-butylphosphine, are<br>
combined with one equivalent of the palladium salt.<br>
EP-A 0 888 261 describes the use of from 2 to 6 equivalents of triphenylphosphine per<br>
equivalent of the palladium catalyst. The use of high ligand excesses is generally<br>
viewed in the literature as disadvantageous, since this is expected to result in<br>
inactivation of the catalytically active complex (cf., for example, J. Hassan et al., Chem.<br>
Rev. 2002, 102, 1359).<br>
!t was thus surprising that the high excess of complex ligand in combination with the<br>
low catalyst use led to an increase in the overall yield of the process of the present	<br>
invention and accordingly to an improvement in the economic viability.<br>
Metallic palladium is used preferably in pulverized form or on a support material, for<br>
example in the form of palladium on activated carbon, palladium on alumina, palladium<br>
on barium carbonate, palladium on barium sulfate, palladium on calcium carbonate,<br>
palladium on aluminosilicates such as montmorillonite, palladium on SiO2 and<br>
palladium on calcium carbonate, in each case with a palladium content of from 0.5 to<br>
12% by weight. In addition to palladium and the support material, these catalysts may<br>
comprise further dopants, for example lead.<br>
When metallic palladium applied to support if appropriate is used, particular preference<br>
is given to also using the aforementioned complex ligands, in particular to the use of<br>
palladium on activated carbon in the presence of triphenylphosphine as a complex<br>
ligand, where the phenyl groups in the triphenylphosphine are preferably substituted by<br>
a total of from one to three sulfonate groups.<br>
In the process according to the invention, the palladium catalyst is used with a low<br>
fraction of from 0.001 to 1.0 mol%, preferably from 0.005 to 0.5 mol% or from 0.01 to<br>
0.5 mol% and in particular from 0.005 to 0.05 mol%, based on the compound (II).<br>
The low use of a palladium salt in combination with a high use of complex ligand<br>
constitutes a significant cost advantage of this process over the prior art processes.<br>
The process according to the invention may be carried out in a biphasic system<br>
composed of aqueous phase and solid phase, i.e. the catalyst. In that case, the<br>
aqueous phase may also comprise a water-soluble organic solvent in addition to water.<br>
Organic solvents suitable for the process according to the invention are ethers such as<br>
dimethoxyethane, diethylene glycol dimethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane and tert-<br>
butyl methyl ether, hydrocarbons such as n-hexane, n-heptane, cyclohexane, benzene,<br><br>
toluene and xylene, alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, 1-propanol, 2-propanol,<br>
ethylene glycol, 1-butanol, 2-butanol and tert-butanol, ketones such as acetone, ethyl<br>
methyl ketone and isobutyl methyl ketone, amides such as dimethylformamide,<br>
dimethylacetamide and /V-methylpyrrolidone, in each case individually or in a mixture.<br>
Preferred solvents are ethers such as dimethoxyethane, tetrahydrofuran and dioxane,<br>
hydrocarbons-such as cyclohexane, toluene and xylene, alcohols such as ethanol,<br>
1-propanol, 2-propanol, 1-butanol and tert-butanol, in. each case individually or in a<br>
mixture.<br>
In a particularly preferred variant of the process according to the invention, water, one or more water-insoluble and one or more water-soluble solvents are used for example mixtures of water and dioxane, or water and tetrahydrofuran, or water, dioxane and<br>
ethanol, or water, tetrahydrofuran and methanol, or water, toluene and tetrahydrofuran,<br>
preferably water and tetrahydrofuran, or water, tetrahydrofuran and methanol.<br>
The total amount of solvent is normally from 3000 to 500 g and preferably from 2000 to<br>
700 g, per mole of the compound (II).<br>
Appropriately, the process is carried out by adding the compound (II), the diphenyl-<br>
borinic acids (III), the base and the catalytic amount of the palladium catalyst to a<br>
mixture of water and one or more inert organic solvents, and stirring at a temperature<br>
of from 50°C to 120°C, preferably from 70°C to 110°C, more preferably from 90°C to<br>
100°C, for a period of from 1 to 50, preferably from 2 to 24 hours.<br>
Depending on the solvent and temperature used, a pressure of from 1 bar to 6 bar,<br>
preferably from' 1 bar to 4 bar, is established.<br>
Preference is given to carrying out the reaction in water and tetrahydrofuran.<br>
The reaction may be carried out in customary apparatus suitable for such processes.<br>
On completion of reaction, palladium catalyst obtained as a solid is removed, for<br>
example by filtration, and the crude product is freed from the solvent or the solvents.<br>
In the case of products which are not fully water-soluble, water-soluble palladium<br>
catalysts or complex ligands are removed fully from the crude product in the separation<br>
of the water phase.<br>
Subsequently, further purification may be effected by methods which are known to<br>
those skilled in the art and are appropriate to the particular product, for example by<br>
recrystallization, distillation, sublimation, zone melting, melt crystallization or<br><br>
chromatography.<br>
By the process according to the invention, it is possible to prepare, for example:<br>

The process according to the invention affords the compounds I in very high up to<br>
quantitative yields at very good purity.<br>
The biphenyls obtainable by the process according to the invention are suitable as<br>
precursors for substituted biphenylamines, which are in turn intermediates for fungicidal<br>
crop protection active ingredients (cf., for example, EP-A 545 099).<br>
Synthesis of 4'-chloro-2-nitrobiphenyl<br>
Example 1: Di-(4-Chlorophenyl)borinic acid<br>
A solution of 120g of trimethyl borate and 590 g of tetrahydrofuran was cooled to 11oC<br>
To this were metered 1000 g of a 20% by weight solution of 4-chlorophenylmagnesium<br>
chloride in tetrahydrofuran within 2 hours. In the course of this, a temperature of 20-<br>
21 °C was established. After full addition, the reaction solution was stirred at 20°C for<br>
another 1 hour.<br>
The reaction mixture was subsequently treated with 621 g of 10% aqueous<br>
hydrochloric acid and stirred at 40°C for 30 minutes. After phase separation, 1500 g of<br>
a solution of di(4-chlorophenyl)borinic acid in tetrahydrofuran were obtained<br>
(conversion 87%). The organic phase may be processed further as a crude product, or<br>
di(4-chlorophenyl)borinic acid may be isolated by column chromatography on silica gel<br>
using mixtures of ethyl acetate and cyclohexane.<br>
Example 2: Reaction of di(4-chlorophenyl)borinic acid and 1-chloro-2-nitrobenzene<br>

hydroxide solution at 15-20°C. To this were metered 539 g of a 9-10% by weight<br>
solution of di(4-chlorophenyl)borinic acid in dioxane at 18-22°C within 26 minutes. After<br>
full addition, the reaction solution was stirred at 18-22°C for 40 minutes. 2.4 g of a 50%<br>
by weight solution of triphenylphosphine in dioxane were added to the reaction<br>

reaction solution was extracted with 250 g of 10% by weight aqueous hydrochloric acid.<br>
After phase separation, a solution of 4-chloro-2'-nitrobiphenyl in dioxane was obtained<br>
(conversion 99%). Dioxane was removed by distillation under reduced pressure and<br><br>
4-chloro-2'-nitrobiphenyl could be isolated by melt crystallization.<br>

minutes. After full addition, the reaction solution was stirred at 18-22°C for 30 minutes.<br>
3.5 g of a 50% by weight solution of triphenylphosphine in tetrahydrofuran were added<br>
to the reaction solution. After full addition, the reaction solution was stirred at 20-21°C<br>
for 30 minutes. Finally, 0.9 g of.palladium(ll) chloride in 227 g of molten 1-chloro-2-<br>
nitrobenzene were added to the reaction solutibn.The reaction solution was heated to 100°C for 6-8 hours. In the course of this, an elevated pressure of 3.0 bar was<br>
established in the autoclave.<br>
After full reaction of the di(4-chlorophenyl)borinic acid, the autoclave was<br>
decompressed to standard pressure and the reaction solution was cooied to 40-50°C.<br>
The reaction solution was extracted with 450 g of 10% by weight aqueous hydrochloric<br>
acid. After phase separation, a solution of 4-chloro-2'-nitrobiphenyl in tetrahydrofuran<br>
was obtained (conversion 99%).<br>
Example 4: Reaction of di-(4-chlorophenyl)borinic acid and 1-chloro-2-nitrobenzene<br>
A 4 I four-necked flask was initially charged with 770 g of 22% by weight aqueous<br>
sodium hydroxide solution at 20°C. To this were metered 2045 g of a 13% by weight<br>
solution of di(4-chlorophenyl)borinic acid in tetrahydrofuran at 20°C within 30 minutes.<br>

40°C and subsequently extracted with 255 g of 35% by weight aqueous hydrochloric<br>
acid. After phase separation, a solution of 4-chloro-2'-nitrobiphenyl in tetrahydrofuran<br>
was obtained (conversion 99%).<br>
Example 5: Reaction of 4-chlorophenylboronic acid and 1-chloro-2-nitrobenzene<br>
A 4 m3 reactor was initially charged with 1773 kg of a 13% by weight solution of<br>
4-chlorophenylboronic acid in tetrahydrofuran at 18-22°C. Within 20 minutes, 538 kg of<br>
25% aqueous sodium hydroxide solution and 140 kg of water were metered in with<br>
stirring at 22-30°C. After full addition, the reaction solution was stirred at 22-25°C for 30<br>
minutes. 2.28 kg of triphenylphosphine, 372 g of palladium(ll) chloride and 252 kg of <br><br>
molten 1-chloro-2-nitrobenzene were added to the reaction solution. The reaction<br>
