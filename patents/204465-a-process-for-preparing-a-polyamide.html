The present invention relates to a novel process for preparing polyamides from aminonitriles and water at elevated temperature and elevated pressure. US 2 245 129 describes a batchwise two-step preparation of polycaprolactam from ω-aminocapronitrile ("ACN") and water at a temperature within the range from 150 to 300°C, governed by a specific temperature program as a function of the amount of water added, and a pressure of not more than 30 bar. The disadvantages of this process are the long reaction times (20 h in step 1), the low viscosity of the resulting polycaproplactam and the high level of volatile bases (essentially primary acid amides) compared with a polycaprolactam j prepared from caprolactam.<br>
DE-C 35 34 817, US 4 568 736 and US 4 629 776 partly solve the problems j described in US 2 245 129 by the use of phosphorus- and sulfur-containing catalysts. The use of the catalysts mentioned improves the low space-time yield of the process described in US 2 245 129. However, the level of volatile bases in all the products prepared by the abovementioned processes is still too high, so that the polyamides are difficult to process and have a reduced carboxyl end group number. The stoichiometric discrepancy between the amino and carboxyl end groups in the products of the abovementioned processes is responsible for<br><br>
their showing an insufficient degree of polymerization and a slow increase in molecular weight during tempering. Furthermore, complete removal of the catalysts is virtually impossible, so that the chemical and physical behavior of the polymers prepared using the catalysts, such as type and quantity of end groups or snap-off behavior during spinning, is adversely affected. EP-A 0 479 306 proposes, in relation to the reaction of ACN with water to give polycaproiactam, to remove ammonia and water continuously, by decompressing, once a reaction temperature from 200. to 260°C has been attained and at the same time to add water continuously while selecting a pressure within the range from 14 to 24 x 106 Pa (14 to 24 bar). EP-A 65 291 describes a continuous process for preparing nylon 66 from dinitriles and diamines. The molecular weight builds up via polycondensation. Caprolactam does not occur as an intermediate, which it does, however, in the polymerization of ACN. Thus, because of the different reaction mechanisms, it was not possible to apply the process mentioned in EP-A 65 291 to the present problem.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a process for preparing polyamides from aminonitriles with improved hydrolysis of the reactants, especially of the acid amide groups, and thus a higher carboxyl end group content. The molecular weight increase during the polymerization and the temperability of the product are improved in this way, compared with prior art<br>
processes.<br>
We have found that this object is achieved by a process for preparing a polyamide by reaction of at least one aminonitrile with water, which comprises the following steps:<br>
(1)	reacting at least one aminonitrile with water at a temperature<br><br>
from  100 to 360°C and a pressure from 0.1 to 35 x  106 Pa to obtain a reaction mixture,<br>
(2)	further reacting the reaction mixture at a temperature from 150 to 400°C and a pressure which is lower than the pressure in step 1, the temperature and the pressure being selected so as to obtaih a first gas phase and a first liquid or a first solid phase or a mixture of first solid and first liquid phase, and separating the first gas phase from the first liquid or the first solid phase or from the mixture of first liquid and first solid phase, and<br>
(3)	admixing the first liquid or the first solid phase or the mixture of first liquid and first solid phase with a gaseous or liquid phase comprising water at a temperature from 150 to 360°C and a pressure from 0.1 to 30 x 106 Pa to obtain a product mixture.<br>
The present invention further provides a process for preparing a polyamide by reaction of at least one aminonitrile with water, which comprises the following steps:<br>
(1)	reacting at least one aminonitrile with water at a temperature from 100 to 360°C and a pressure from 0.1 to 35 x 106 Pa to obtain a reaction mixture,<br>
(2)	further reacting the reaction mixture at a temperature from 150 to 400°C and a pressure which is lower than the pressure in step 1, the temperature and the pressure being selected so as to obtain a first gas phase and a first liquid or a first solid phase or a<br><br>
mixture of first solid and first liquid phase, and separating the first gas phase from the first liquid or the first solid phase or from the mixture of first liquid and first solid phase, and<br>
(3)	admixing the first liquid or the first solid phase or the mixture of first liquid and first solid phase with a gaseous or liquid phase comprising water at a temperature from 150 to 360°C and a pressure from 0.1 to 30 x 106 Pa to obtain a product mixture,<br>
(4)	postcondensing the product mixture at a temperature from 200 to 350 °C and a pressure which is lower than the pressure of step 3, the temperature and pressure being selected so as to obtain a second, water- and ammonia-comprising gas phase and a second liquid or second solid phase or a mixture of second liquid and second solid phase, which each comprise the polyamide.<br>
The present invention further provides a process for preparing a polyamide by reaction of at least one aminonitrile with water, which comprises the following steps:<br>
(1)	reacting at least one aminonitrile with water at a tempeiature from 100 to 360°C and a pressure from 0.1 to 35 x 106 Pa to obtain a reaction mixture,<br>
(2)	further reacting the reaction mixture at a temperature from 150 to 400 °C and a pressure which is lower than the pressure in step 1, the temperature and the pressure being selected so as to obtain a first gas phase and a first liquid or a first solid phase or a<br><br>
mixture of first solid and first liquid phase, and separating the first gas phase from the first liquid or the first solid phase or from the mixture of first liquid and first solid phase, and<br>
(4)	postcondensing the first liquid or first solid phase or the mixture<br>
of first liquid and first solid phase at a temperature from 200 to 350° C and a pressure which is lower than the pressure of step 3, the temperature and pressure being selected so as to obtain a second, water- and ammonia-comprising gas phase and a second liquid or second solid phase or a mixture of second liquid and second solid phase, which each comprise the polyamide.<br>
The aminonitrile can be in principle any aminonitrile, ie., any compound having both at least one amino group and at least one nitrile group. W-Aminonitriles are preferred, especially co-aminoalkyl nitriles having from 4 to 12 carbon atoms, more preferably 4 to 9 carbon atoms, in the alkylene moiety, or aminoalkylaryl nitriles having from 8 to 13 carbon atoms, preferred aminoalkylaryl nitriles being aminoalkylaryl nitriles which have an alkyl spater of at least one carbon atom between the aromatic unit and the amino and nitrile group. Especially preferred aminoalkylaryl nitriles are those which have the amino group and nitrile group in the 1,4 position relative to each other. The w-aminoalkyl nitrile used is preferably a linear w-aminoalkyl nitrile in which the alkylene moiety (-CH2-) preferably contains from 4 to 12 carbon atoms, more preferably from 4 to 9 carbon atoms, such as 6-amino-l-cyanopentane (6-aminocapronitrile), 7-amino-l-cyanohexane, 8-amino- 1-cyanoheptane, 9-amino- 1-cyanooctane, 10-amino- 1-cyanononane, particularly preferably 6-aminocapronitrile. 6-Aminocapronitrile  is customarily obtained by  hydrogenation of adiponitrile<br><br>
according to known methods, described for example in DE-A 836,938,  DE-A<br>
848,654 or US-A 5,151,543.<br>
Of course, it is also possible to use mixtures of a plurality of aminonitriles or<br>

or the below-defined mixture.<br>
In a particular embodiment, especially if copolyamides are to be prepared, the<br>
following mixture is used instead of pure 6-aminocapronitrile:<br>
from    50    to    99.9,    preferably    from    80    to    90,    %    by    weight    of<br>

having from 4 to 10 carbon atoms,<br>
from    0    to    50,    preferably    from    0    to    30,    %    by    weight    of   an<br>
α,ω;-C2-C12-dinitrile, and<br>
from 0 to 50, preferably from 0 to 30, % by weight of an α,ω-C5-C12-amino<br>

cyclo-hexanedicarboxylic acid.<br>
Suitable    a,w-diamines    having    from    4    to    10    carbon    atoms    include<br>

heptamethylenediamine,     octamethylenediamine,      nonamethylenediamine     and<br>
decamethylenediamine, preferably hexamethylenediamine.<br>
It is further also possible to use salts of the aforementioned dicarboxylic acids<br>
and  diamines,   especially  the  salt  of adipic  acid  and  hexamethylenediamine,<br>
which is known as 6,6 salt.<br>
The  α ωC2-C12-dinitrile   used   is   preferably   an   aliphatic   dinitrile   such   as<br>

i ,7-dicyanoheptane,   1,8-dicyanooctane,   1,9-dicyanononane,   1,10-dicyanodecane,<br>
particularly preferably adiponitrile.<br>
If desired,   it is  also  possible to use diamines,   dinitriles and aminonitriles<br>
derived from branched alkyls or aryls or alkylaryls.<br>

10-aminodecanoic acid,   11-arainoundecanoic acid or  12-aminododecanoic acid,<br>
preferably 6-aminohexanoic acid.<br>
According   to   the   invention,   the   first   step   (step   1)   involves   heating   an<br>
aminonitrile with water at a temperature  from about   100  to about 360°C,<br>
preferably about 200 to about 350°C, especially about 250 to about 300°C, to<br>
which a pressure from about 0.1 to about 35 x 106 Pa, preferably about 4 to<br>
about 30 x 106 Pa, especially about 6 to about 12 x 106 Pa, is set. In this<br>
step, the pressure and the temperature can be adjusted relative to each other<br>
in such a way as to obtain a liquid or a solid phase and a mixture of liquid<br>
or solid phase and a gaseous phase.<br>
According to the invention, water is used in a molar ratio of aminoalkyl nitrile<br>
to water within the range 1:1 to 1:30, particularly preferably within the range<br>
1:2 to 1:10, very particularly preferably within the range from  1:2 to  1:4,<br>
preference being given to the use of water in excess, based on the aminoalkyl<br>
nitrile used.<br><br>
In this embodiment, the liquid or solid phase or the mixture of liquid and solid phase   corresponds   to   the   reaction   mixture,   whereas   the   gaseous   phase   is separated off.  As part of this step,  the gaseous phase can be separated  from the liquid or solid phase or from the mixture of solid or liquid phase at once, or the synthesis mixture forming within this step can be present in two-phase form:   liquid/gaseous,   solid/gaseous   or   liquid-solid/gaseous.   Of   course,   the pressure and temperature can also be adjusted relative to each other in such a way that the synthesis mixture is present as a single solid or liquid phase. The removal of the gas phase can be effected by the use of stirred or unstirred separating vessels or vessel batteries and by the use of evaporator apparatus, for example by means of circulatory evaporators or thin-film evaporators, e.g., filmtruders,  or by means of annular disk reactors,  which ensure an enlarged phase interface.  In certain cases, recirculation of the synthesis mixture or the<br>
i<br>
use of a loop reactor may be necessary to increase the phase interface.1 Furthermore, the removal of the gas phase can be furthered by the addition of water vapor or inert gas into the liquid phase.<br>
Preferably, the pressure is adjusted at a preselected temperature so that the pressure is smaller than the equilibrium vapor pressure of ammonia, but greater than the equilibrium vapor pressure of the other components in the synthesis mixture at the given temperature. This way, it is possible to favor especially the removal of ammonia and thus speed up the hydrolysis of the acid amide<br>
groups.<br>
Step 1 can be carried out using stirred vessels, flow pipes or vessel batteries, A two-phase procedure is preferably carried out using vessels or a reaction column, whereas a procedure involving a single liquid phase is preferably carried out using a packed flow pipe. The use of a tube bundle reactor, facultatively packed, in the first process step is likewise possible and advantageous for a two-phase procedure especially, to improve the heat transfer<br><br>
and to further reduce the axial back-mixing of the reactants. Usable packing elements include, for example, Raschig rings or Sulzer mixing elements in order that a narrow residence time distribution may be ensured and in order that back-mixing may be limited.<br>
In a further embodiment, the reactor of the first step is subjected to a downward flow regime, in which case it is again preferably equipped with packing elements which limit any axial back-mixing of the reactants. As a result, the ammonia gas liberated in the reactor, predominantly directly after entry into the reactor, reaches the gas phase at the top of the reactor by the most direct route. Interference caused to the flow profile in the further course of the reactor by ascending gas bubbles or convection is therefore minimal. As regards the residence time of the synthesis mixture in the first step, there are no restrictions whatsoever; however, it is generally set within the range from about 10 minutes to about 10 hours, preferably within the range from<br>
about 30 minutes to about 6 hours.<br>
i<br>
Although there are no restrictions whatsoever concerning the degree of conversion of nitrile groups in step 1 either, economic reasons especially dictate that the conversion of nitrile groups in step 1 be generally not less than about 70 mol%, preferably at least about 95 mol%, and especially within the range from about 97 to about 99 mol%, based on the moles of aminonitrile used. The nitrile group conversion is customarily determined by means of IR spectroscopy (CN stretching vibration at 2247 wavenumbers), NMR or HPLC, preferably by IR spectroscopy.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment, the aminonitrile/water mixture is continuously heated with the aid of a heat exchanger and the mixture thus heated is introduced into a reaction vessel heated to the same temperature, preferably into a tube which, if desired, may include internals such as Sulzer mixing elements to avoid back-mixing. Of course, the aminonitrile and the water can also be<br><br>
heated up separately.<br>
Nor does the invention rule out conducting the reaction in step I in the presence of oxygen-containing phosphorus compounds, especially phosphoric acid, phosphorous acid and hypophosphorous acid and alkali metal and alkaline earth metal salts and ammonium salts such as Na3P04, NaH2P04, Na2HP04, NaH2P03, Na2HP03, NaH2P02, K3P04, KH2P04, K2HP04, KH2P03, K2HP03, KH2P02, in which case the molar ratio of oj-aminonitrile to phosphorus compounds is selected within the range from 0.01:1 to 1:1, preferably within the range from 0.01:1 to 0.1:1.<br>
Nor does it rule out using known metal oxides, for example titanium dioxides, zirconium oxide, aluminum oxide, lanthanum oxide, magnesium oxide, etc., preferably titanium dioxides, for heterogeneous catalysis in the individual process steps in order that the conversion, especially of the nitrile groups, may be furthered. The abovementioned metal oxides are not used in step 4, but they can be used in steps 1 to 3, in which case the use in step 1 is preferred. According to the invention, the reaction mixture obtained in the first step is further reacted in step 2 at a temperature from about 150 to about 400°C, preferably at a temperature within the range from about 220 to about 350°C, especially within the range from about 250 to about 290°C, and a pressure which is lower than the pressure in step 1. The pressure in step 2 is preferably at least about 0.5 x 106 Pa lower than the pressure in step 1, and generally the pressure will be within the range from about 0.05 to about 45 x 106 Pa, preferably within the range from about 0.5 to about 15 x 106 Pa, especially within the range from about 0.5 to about 5 x 106 Pa. In step 2, the temperature and the pressure are chosen so as to obtain a first gas phase and a first liquid or first solid phase or a mixture of first liquid and first solid phase and the first gas phase is separated from the first liquid or first solid phase or from the mixture of first liquid and first solid phase.<br><br>
The first gaseous phase, which consists essentially of ammonia and water vapor, is generally removed continuously by means of a distillation apparatus, for example a distillation column. Any organic constituents of the distillate coremoved in the course of this distillation, predominantly unconverted aminonitrile, can be wholly or partly recycled into step 1 and/or step 2. The residence time of the reaction mixture in step 2 is not subject to any restrictions whatsoever, but is generally within the range from about 10 minutes to about 5 hours, preferably within the range from about 15 minutes to about 4 hours.<br>
The product line between the first and second steps optionally contains packing elements, for example Raschig rings or Sulzer mixing elements, which facilitate a controlled expansion of the reaction mixture into the gas phase. In step 3, the first liquid or the first solid phase or the mixture of first liquid and first solid phase is admixed with a gaseous or liquid phase comprising water, preferably with water or water vapor. This is preferably done continuously. The amount of water added (as liquid) is preferably within the range from about 50 to about 1500 ml, more preferably within the range from about 100 to about 500 ml, based on 1 kg of the first liquid or first solid phase or of the mixture of first liquid and first solid phase. This addition of water primarily compensates the water losses incurred in step 2 and furthers the hydrolysis of acid amide groups in the synthesis mixture. This results in a further advantage of this invention, that the mixture of the starting materials as used in step 1 can be used with a small excess of water only. The water-comprising gaseous or liquid phase is preferably preheated in a heat exchanger before being introduced into step 3 and then mixed with the first liquid or the first solid phase or the mixture of first solid and first liquid phase. The reactor may optionally be fitted with mixing elements which further the mixing of the components.<br><br>
Step 3 is operated at a temperature from  150 to 400°C and a pressure  from 0.1 to 30 x    106 Pa.<br>
The pressure and temperature can be adjusted to each other in such a way that<br>
the synthesis mixture is present as a single liquid or solid phase. In another<br>
embodiment, the pressure and temperature are selected so that a liquid or solid<br>
phase or a mixture of solid and liquid phase and also a gaseous phase are<br>
obtained. In this embodiment, the liquid or solid phase or the mixture of liquid<br>
and solid phase corresponds to the product mixture, whereas the gaseous phase<br>
is separated off. As part of this step, the gaseous phase can be separated from<br>
the liquid or solid phase or from the mixture of solid and liquid phase at once,<br>
or the synthesis mixture forming within this step can be present in two-phase<br>
form: liquid/gaseous, solid/gaseous or liquid-solid/gaseous.	'<br>
The pressure can be adjusted at a preselected temperature so that the pressure is smaller than the equilibrium vapor pressure of ammonia, but greater than the equilibrium vapor pressure of the other components in the synthesis mixture at the given temperature. This way, it is possible to favor especially the removal of ammonia and thus speed up the hydrolysis of the acid amide groups. The apparatus/reactors usable in this step are identical with those of step 1, discussed above.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the two-phase procedure is carried out by subjecting the reactor of step 1 to downward flow, in which case this reactor is preferably again equipped with packing elements which limit any axial back-mixing of the reactants. As a result, the ammonia gas liberated in the reactor, predominantly directly after entry into the reactor, reaches the gas phase at the top of the reactor by the most direct route. Interference caused to the flow profile in the further course of the reactor by ascending gas bubbles or convection is therefore minimal. The residence time of this step is likewise not subject to any restrictions, but<br><br>
economic reasons generally dictate a range from about  10 minutes to about 3<br>
hours, preferably about 20 to about 90 minutes.<br>
The product mixture obtained in step 3 can be further processed as described<br>
below.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the product mixture of step 3  is subjected to a postcondensation in step 4 at temperatures from about 200 to about 350°C, preferably at temperatures of about 220 to 300°C, especially from about 250 to 270°C. Step 4 is carried out at a pressure which is below the pressure of step 3 and would preferably be within the range from about 5 to 1000 x 103 Pa, more preferably within the range from about 10 to about 300 x 103 Pa. In the context of this step, the temperature and pressure are selected so as to obtain a second gas.phase and a second liquid or solid phase or a mixture of second liquid and second solid phase which each comprise the polyamide.    ; The postcondensation of step 4 is preferably carried out in such a way that the relative viscosity (measured at a temperature of 25°C and a concentration of 1 g of polymer per 100 ml in 96% strength by weight of sulfuric acid) of the polyamide assume a value within the range of about 1.6 to about 3.5, In a preferred  embodiment,  any water  present  in the  liquid phase  can be expelled by means of an inert gas such as nitrogen.<br>
The residence time of the reaction mixture in step 4 depends especially on the desired relative viscosity, the temperature, the pressure and the amount of water<br>
added in step 3.<br>
If step 3 is operated as a single-phase regime, the product line between step<br>
3 and step 4 may optionally contain packing elements,  for example Raschig<br>
rings or Sulzer mixing elements, which allow a controlled expansion of the<br>
reaction mixture in the gas phase.<br>
In a further embodiment of the invention, step 3 may be dispensed with and<br>
the polyamide is prepared by carrying out steps (1), (2) and (4).<br><br>
This variant is preferably carried out as follows:<br>
In step 1, at least one aminoalkyl nitrile is heated with an excess of water at a temperature within the range from about 250 to about 350°C, more preferably from about 270 to about 300°C and a pressure of from about 4 to 30 x ltf5 Pa, more preferably from about 6 to 30 x 106 Pa, particularly from about 7 to 13 x 106 Pa, and even more preferably from about 8 to 12 x 106 Pa, the pressure and temperature being adjusted to each other in such a way that the synthesis mixture is present as a single liquid phase and the nitrile group conversion being not less than 95 mol%, more preferably in the range of about 97 to 99 moI%, based on the moles of aminoalkyl nitrile used, to obtain a reaction mixture.<br>
The reaction mixture is treated in step 2 at a temperature within the range from about 220 to about 300°C, and more preferably about 250 to 270°C, and a pressure within the range from about 1 to about 7 x 106 Pa, more preferably from about 1 to 4 x 106 Pa, the pressure in step 2 being at least 0.5 x 106 Pa lower than in step 1. At the same time, the resulting first gas phase is separated from the first liquid phase.<br>
The first liquid phase obtained in step 2 is treated in step 3 at a temperature within the range from about 220 to 300°C, more preferably from about 250 to 270°C, and a pressure within the range from about 10 to about 300 x 103 Pa, more preferably at about atmospheric pressure, the resulting second, water-and ammonia-comprising gas phase being separated from the second liquid phase. Within this step, the relative viscosity (measured as defined above) of the resulting polyamide is adjusted to a desired value within the range from about 1.6 to about 3.5 through choice of temperature and residence time. The resulting second liquid phase  is then conventionally discharged and,  if<br>
desired, worked up.<br>
The above-described processes, i.e., the sequence according to the invention of<br><br>
steps (I) to (3) or (1), (2) and (4) or (I) to (4), can be carried out batchwise, i.e., in succession in a single reactor, or continuously, i.e., simultaneously in successive reactors. It is also possible, of course, to carry out some of these steps, for example steps (1) and (2), continuously and the remaining step(s) batchwise.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment of the present invention, at least one of the gas phases obtained in the respective steps can be recycled into at least one of the preceding steps.<br>
