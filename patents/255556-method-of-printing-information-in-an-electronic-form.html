				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a method of form recognition and form filling. Further, this invention relates to electronic form filling without the necessity for complete overlaying. More particularly, this invention explains a system and method for easily filling and printing forms using multi functional device from PC.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
It is time consuming to manually key in and validate the information presented in a hand written or preprinted filled form. The effort of the person processing such information is more when there are more responses in situations such as a survey. Processing is more difficult if the data has to be revalidated for ensuring security in areas of relevance like banking. The data filled cannot be erased once it is keyed in. It is therefore a better solution to provide the customers or users the facility to fill in the forms through an electronic device that interacts with them. With the help of MFP that is connected to PC through parallel port, serial port, USB or Network card the user can fill in the forms correctly and neatly and take a print out of the form with the necessary information typed in the required fields.<br>
A method of processing documents using the overlaying techniques is known from granted US patent Suganuma, et al. 4,542,378 and is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Figure 1 shows a form 1 for a seal impression certificate, a seal registration book 2 and a seal impression certificate 3 as finally issued. At first, an overlay form is prepared by cutting out a portion 1a from the form 1. Then a portion is extracted from the seal registration book 2 and reproduced while being overlaid with the above overlay form, to produce the final certificate 3.Then, the control section reads out the data for the certificate form 1 from among the data in the memory 4,<br><br>
files them in another address, and thereafter reads out the additional required portion, for example the portion 2a, from the data from the seal registration book 2, and transcribes this portion while electronically overlaying it with the previously filed data for the seal impression certificate form 1. As a result, the data for the final seal impression certificate 3 are prepared in the memory.<br>
According to the said patent, the blank forms are read by an image input device and the format thereof is stored in a memory. Additional information for filling in the form is inserted in the same manner and the information is electronically overlaid using a control device in the memory, so that a completed form is stored in the memory for output by a printing device. Here both the documents are read using an input means having a platen. Once the blank form having areas designated for said overlaid information is input to the device the format information is permanently stored in the memory section and therefore further blank forms are unnecessary. The overlaying is achieved by reading out the format information data from the first memory section, filling the said data in another memory address and thereafter reading the data corresponding to the selected information and transcribing the latter data with the former data in order to get the overlaid format. According to the above method, the two documents are read and stored and thereafter the selected information is separated from the data thus stored.<br>
A method of printing and a print system for automatically print-filling in an original form with the data entered through an electronic input device is known from the US patent Siegel 6,026,187.<br>
Referring now to Figure 2, an exemplary printing system 10 is illustrated. As shown, the printing system 10 includes a printer unit 12 for holding and printing on sheets including the original form. On the other hand, a laser type printer includes a fusing area "F\ a Sheet Supply area "SS" for holding and feeding copy sheets or forms to the Marking Section for printing thereon, and an output unit or tray "T for receiving the printed sheets or forms. The printing system 10 includes a digital<br><br>
raster input scanner (RIS) unit 14 that is connected to a main processor 16 for scanning a page of the original form at a time, including fill-in areas of the original form. The main processor stores all of the information contained in the original form into a first memory area or layer M1, for example a RAM (random access memory) or an NVM (non-volatile memory) area. As also shown, the printing system 10 includes the main processor 16 that is connected to and controls the printer unit 12, the scanner unit 14, and the other components of the printing system 10. Main processor 16, for example, includes a central processing unit or CPU 18, multiple memory areas M1, M2, M3, image manipulation means 20 including an image manipulation program (IMP), and controllers for example, 22, 24 for controlling components of the printing system 10. The printing system 10 also includes a display unit 26 such as a user's computer monitor screen that is connected to the main processor 16 and to the image manipulation means 20. An operator input unit 28 such as computer keyboard, which together with the display unit 26 constitute an operator workstation, is also provided as part of the printing system 10.<br>
According to the method, an original hard copy of form having preprinted areas and fill-in blank areas are scanned and stored as an electronic document and a second electronic document that is blank but having a size and bitmap co-ordinate system identical to those of the first electronic document is created. After that the first electronic document and the second electronic document are simultaneously displayed on a display apparatus with the second electronic document overlaying the first electronic document. The user can fill-in the information into areas on the second electronic document overlaying the fill-in blank areas of the first electronic document and initiate to automatically and selectively print the second electronic document containing only the required fill-in information in printed form thereon to the original hardcopy. The original form has to be loaded to the printer in a tested and proper orientation for correctly receiving the required fill-in information in the fill-in areas thereon. In order to achieve the above result, the display unit and the printer central unit are equipped with means for manipulating the first and second<br><br>
electronic documents as first and second screens respectively with the second screen overlaying the said first screen.<br>
It is understood that both the patents mentioned above work based on overlaying two files before printing. In US Patent 4,542,378, the overlaying is done in memory and hence has the advantage of reduced use of memory. As per US Patent 6,026,187, the merging happens while printing and the required fill-in information can be fed through a keyboard. However the teachings of the prior art are geared towards filling the form at the printer and the information is stored in the individual stand-alone device. Moreover, addition of expensive hardware such as CRT displays and controllers is required to each of the existing printer hardware.<br>
Therefore in the light of the foregoing deficiencies in the prior art, the applicant's invention is herein presented.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The primary object of the invention is therefore to provide a method for electronically filling and validating forms whereby the overlaying for form filling completely is avoided and to introduce a method for validating the forms.<br>

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
Figure 1 shows a method of overlaying two electronically generated documents as per prior art.<br>
Figure 2 represents a printing system, which enables the printing of information on an original hard copy form as per prior art.<br>
Figure 3 presents a system according to the invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings. It should be understood however that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention, which may be embodied in various forms. The following description and drawings are not to be construed as limiting the invention and numerous specific details are described to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention, as the basis for the claims and as a basis for teaching one skilled in the art how to make and/or use<br><br>
the invention. However in certain instances, well-known or conventional details are not described in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention in detail.<br>
Each step of the invention method is describes as below.<br>
1.	Each form is numbered uniquely so that it is recognized by MFP.<br>
2.	If the form is complex and validation is required, the validation criteria are submitted to MFP in hard copy or to software in workstation in soft copy.<br>
3.	The validation criteria are described in XML form in hard copy, for the software criteria can be told dynamically.<br>
4.	The forms are placed in separate tray of the Multi Functional Peripheral device.<br>
5.	The End user requests the form using its identification number through the interface provided by the software at workstation.<br>
6.	MFP searches the hard copies for required copy, first it checks for validation criteria of the requested form whose number is followed by "V".<br>
7.	If validation form is found MFP sends to Workstation.<br>
8.	The workstation parses and understands the criteria.<br>
9.	MFP sends the actual form.<br>
10.	The form is showed on the display.<br>
11.	Now the user can fill the fields, the fields are validated by the software.<br>
12.	When the user presses submit, the software sends the filled form in PCL format putting blanks in place of pre filled information.<br>
13.The MFP prints the information on the same original form.<br>
Figure 3 shows the communication flow diagram of the invention wherein the PC and the MFP interact each other to perform the desired task. There is a unique number for each form for identification. The forms are placed in separate tray of<br><br>
the Multi Functional Peripheral device. The main purpose here is to get the exact form displayed in the user interface in the workstation and print the inputs given by the user in the said form. For performing this there should be a validation criteria wherein the credentials are verified and authorized. Consider for example that a request for form X is given by the user from his interface from a remote workstation. The validation criteria first checks if there exist any form which the user has given a request. If the request by the user is a valid one then the MFP identifies the exact form and intimates the user accordingly. Then the exact format of the form which is stored in the MFP is send to the user and gets displayed in the user interface in the PC. Now the form is displayed at the interface wherein the user can input the data which has to be filled up with respect to the specific form. Once again a data validation is performed wherein the information keyed in by the user is crosschecked for the format, authenticity and validity. The PC will then generate the PCL data putting blank in place or the preprinted data in the form. Once the information is submitted by the user only the data entered by the user alone only transmitted to the MFP end. The PC sends the filled form in PCL format putting blanks in place of pre filled information. When the data reaches the MFP, the form requested by the user is automatically taken from the tray by the MFP and the data gets printed in the same form.<br>
The invention explains a system for filling and submitting a form using a network-connected rendering device having a user interface. Here a display unit is connected to the said rendering device. The system consists of an input unit connected to the said rendering device wherein the input unit is an alphanumeric keyboard. The system also has a means for writing a form that contains information about empty fields. It has a means for transferring the said form to the said rendering device and also a means for storing the said form on the said rendering device permanently. The input device is used for inputting the fields of the said form on the said rendering device. The system has a means for fitting the filled form values into the said form and a means for validating the form. Finally it consists of a means for submitting form generating PCL data. The connection<br><br>
means for downloading the form is a parallel or USB connection that is not network oriented. The display unit used is an LCD panel.<br>
5<br>
It will also be obvious to those skilled in the art that other control methods and apparatuses can be derived from the combinations of the various methods and apparatuses of the present invention as taught by the description and the accompanying drawings and these shall also be considered within the scope of the present invention. Further, description of such combinations and variations is therefore omitted above. It should also be noted that the host for storing the applications include but not limited to a computer, mobile communication device, mobile server or a multi function device.<br>
Although the present invention has been fully described in connection with the preferred embodiments thereof with reference to the accompanying drawings, it is to be noted that various changes and modifications are possible and are apparent to those skilled in the art. Such changes and modifications are to be understood as included within the scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims unless they depart there from.<br><br><br>
