				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The present invention in general relates to a novel process for preparing a sea food and to the<br>
product thereof and, in particular to a novel process for preparing, antioxidant enriched<br>
carbohydrate-protein mixed extruded snack and the product thereof.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION:<br>
In recent years, demand for nutritive food, particularly those having source of protein, has<br>
increased substantially amongst consumers all over the world. In that respect, the demand for<br>
sea food has increased in majority of the countries, having regard to its high protein and low<br>
calorie content. Furthermore, apart from being the richest source of protein and having other<br>
biological importance, as will be known to persons skilled in the art, sea/marine food is<br>
profusely available. The demand for crustaceans such as crabs and shrimps are worth<br>
mentionable, in this perspective, because of their relatively mild flavour, excellent taste and<br>
textures. To meet the continuous demand for crustaceans, different methods have been<br>
developed for preparing crustacean like products. US Patent Nos. 3,863,017; 4,158,065;<br>
4,303,688 and 4,584,204 provide the methods for cooking shrimps and other crustaceans like<br>
products from different kinds of marine fish and US Patents 4,919,959, 4,880,659,4,816,278<br>
disclose process of preparing texturised extruded product using marine protein and vegetable<br>
protein flour.<br>
However, the prior art methodologies for manufacturing sea food , apart from being costly, do<br>
not advocate specific techniques for increasing the shelf life of high protein crustaceans like<br>
the shrimps, employed in manufacturing such sea food and snacks thereof, at the time of<br>
preserving to export or delivery to a long distance. Furthermore the methodology for<br>
manufacturing, the sea food and snacks thereof, disclosed in said prior art documents, do not<br>
advocate application of suitable herbs for retention of antioxidant property in the end product,<br>
being extruded high protein sea food and snacks thereof. It is well known, that retention of<br>
antioxidant property in the final product, is of immense importance from medical perspective.<br>
Additionally, the sea food and snacks thereof obtained from prior art techniques, did not have<br>
the herbal flavour being more acceptable to customers from taste related aspects , even<br>
though such food had high protein concent.<br><br>
Hence, there was a long felt need for a methodology for obtaining high protein sea food and<br>
the product thereof, which advocates specific techniques for increasing the shelf life of high<br>
protein crustaceans like the shrimps, employed in manufacturing such sea food and snacks<br>
thereof at the time of preserving to export or delivery to a long distance, is cost effective,<br>
advocates application of suitable herbs for retention of antioxidant property in the end product,<br>
and additionally, ensures herbal flavour in the end product.<br>
There was also a long felt need for a methodology for obtaining high protein sea food and the<br>
product thereof which, apart from having the advantages stated in the preceding paragraph,<br>
simultaneously shows low viscosity profile, no fragmentation in protein part and presence of<br>
soluble solid available after extrusion, which is the most important criteria for fabrication of<br>
new food product, and retention of antioxidant property at optimal condition.<br>
The present invention meets the aforesaid long felt needs.<br>
All through out the specification including the claims, the words "herbs", "herbal", "crustaceans",<br>
"shrimps", "snack(s)", "sea food", "marine food", "ayurvedic", "extruder" are to be interpreted in<br>
the broadest sense of the respective terms and includes all similar items in the field known by other<br>
terms, as may be clear to persons skilled in the art. Restriction/limitation, if any, referred to in the<br>
specification, is solely by way of example and understanding the present invention.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The following non-limiting description includes elaboration on some preferred embodiments of<br>
the invention and experimental test results, apart from other description, all of which are by<br>
way of understanding the performance of the invention and not by way of any sort of<br>
limitation.<br>
As stated in the portion under the heading "Background of The Invention" the present<br>
invention aims at providing a process for preparation of a sea food and snacks thereof, which<br>
includes high protein crustaceans such as shrimps and the process involves methodology which<br>
ensures increasing the shelf life of the high protein crustaceans, is economically reasonable ,<br>
applies herbs for herbal flavour and for retention of antioxidant property. That apart, the end<br>
product, being sea food including high protein crustaceans like shrimps, has herbal flavour for<br>
good mouth feeling to customers, retains antioxidant property, has low viscosity profile,<br>
ensures no fragmentation in protein part and decrease of protein solubility.<br>
The aforesaid aspects were hitherto not advocated in prior art methodologies and products and<br>
were not obvious to persons skilled in the art from the same. Further advantages, will be<br>
evident from the non-limiting descript!on hereinafter.<br>
In the above context it is hereby clarified that simply by way of example and for understanding the<br>
invention and not by way of any limitation, the high protein crustaceans referred to in the present<br>
invention have been described as shrimps. It should be understood to persons skilled in the art that<br>
other acceptable high protein crustaceans may also be applied, in the present invention and will be<br>
equally effective in achieving the objects of the present invention.<br><br>
It is known that shrimps, act as the richest source of protein and iodine amongst the<br>
crustaceans. Shrimps, when applied in cooking makes the food tasty, having regard to the<br>
flavour ingredients present in it. This attracts mass consumption. Shrimps have been also<br>
ranked as an excellent source of selenium and unusually low-fat, low-calorie protein. Four<br>
ounce serving of shrimp supplies 17.7 grams of protein (that's 47.4% of the daily value for<br>
protein) for a mere 84 k calories and less than a gram of fat. Shrimps also act as very good<br>
source of vitamin D and vitamin B12.<br>
Shrimps also provide large cardiovascular benefits. Although shrimps are very low in total fat,<br>
however cholesterol content of shrimps is comparatively high. For example 3.5 ounces of<br>
shrimp or 12 large boiled shrimps have about 200 milligrams of cholestrol. However,<br>
researches involving shrimp and blood cholesterol levels have established that avoidance of<br>
shrimp for this reason is not required. Hence, shrimps have become commercially important,<br>
among all other seafood products. It has been reported that shrimps contain 17.7% protein<br>
and 8.5% fat having energy 349 Kcal, with a certain percentage of Selenium and Vitamin B12.<br>
A shrimp having weight of 3 oz produces 21 to 37mcg iodine.<br>
To produce shrimp having excellent economic value, it is traditionally cultured along the costal<br>
belt for a long time. At present, shrimp farming areas are rapidly expanding due to the<br>
increasing demand of the shrimps in the international market.<br>
In recent years, the shrimp farming activity is thriving in the coastal belt because of availability<br>
of brackish water and land with suitable ranges of salinity, pH, tide and other local favourable<br>
condition including climate, skill labour, availability of wild fry and so on. Hqwever, proper<br>
technology has not yet been implemented or developed so far to increase the shelf life of the<br>
shrimp at the time of preserving to export or delivery to a long distance. Traditionally, shrimp<br>
after collection is sun dried and packed for marketing. It has been established, that the food<br>
value of this kind of material gets deteriorated, due to over heating or aerial oxidation which<br>
in turn causes, rapid de-generation of highly sensitive protein present in it. Due to lack of<br>
proper preservation system, 20% of the shrimps collected from the costal areas are wasted<br>
every year. The methodology of the present invention, provides for proper preservation of this<br>
kind of foods, so that the loss of huge source of commercial seafood is avoided.<br><br>
Medicinal antioxidant and herb is of today's interest to be incorporated in the food habit. In the<br>
regular food habit many antioxidants are used in the cooked process viz. spinach, lettuce and<br>
so on. However, cooking of this medicinal herbal antioxidant has not yet been assayed for<br>
retention of antioxidant property.<br>
The plant Withania somnlfera Dunal. (aswagandha,WS), is widely used in herbal formulations<br>
of Indian Ayurvedic medicine system to attenuate a cerebral function deficit in the geriatric<br>
population, and to augment the faculty of learning and memory to provide a non-specific host<br>
defense. These beneficial effects help the organism to ward off stress and act as an adaptogen.<br>
Ashwagandha also shows significant protection against pentylene tetrazole induced seizures in<br>
experimental models of epilepsy, indicating its potential utility for treatment of petitmal<br>
epilepsy. Ashwagandha administration, shows a significant decrease in the core body<br>
temperature suggesting a reduced Body Metabolic Rate (BMR), enhanced body growth and<br>
increased longevity. Not only that, traditional Ayurvedic use of WS has included many diseases<br>
associated with free radical oxidative image, the effects has been considered due to<br>
antioxidant activity. The active principal of WS, sitoindosides VII-X and withaferin A<br>
(glycowithanolides) have been tested for antioxidant activity using scavenging enzymes<br>
superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase in the rat brain frontal cortex and<br>
striatum. (Lakshmi Chandra Mishra et al 2000).<br>
Now, cooking of medicinal herb has not yet been reported. The present invention further<br>
discloses, preparation an extruded protein enriched with medicinal herb Aswagandha.<br>
The starting materials for preparation of extruded snack in accordance with a preferred<br>
embodiment of the process of the present invention include shrimps, small fish, rice flour,<br>
Aswasgandha leaf and root extract materials for making extruded snack.<br>
Shrimp powder:<br>
By way of understanding the present invention and not by way of any limitation, Shrimps of<br>
local variety named lali (Metapenaeopsis stridulans ), Chapra (Penaeus indicus ) are sliced<br>
after elimination of head and shell in 10 a small piece and mixed with salt (3.5-5% w/w) and a<br>
powder mix is prepared in a grinder and mix with binding materials like rice flour to make a<br>
powder mix.<br><br>
Small sea fish powder:<br>
Other small sea fishes are also churned and kneaded with salt, in the same ratio as stated to<br>
prepare.<br>
Aswagandha Powder:<br>
Water soluble, high purity biologically active composition of Aswagandha root and leaf stock<br>
(1:1) are prepared following traditionally advocated techniques, as known to persons skilled in<br>
the art. The extract composition of Aswagandha is obtained by mixing root and leaf stock, in<br>
a suitable ratio of each, e.g. 1:1, of a Withania Somnifera plant of about 2 years old. The root<br>
and leaf stock is substantially extracted at about 60DC with an aqueous-alcoholic solvent,<br>
with water and methanol, ethanol or isopropyl alcohol, in a suitable ratio, e.g. 1:9. Preferably,<br>
other ingredients are also incorporated, such as about 0.1-20% of an additive or exogenous<br>
saccharide such as dextrin, cane sugar, the plants oligosaccharide, beta.-cyclodextrin, to<br>
convert the conjugation of free withananolides in the leaves into desirable bioactive wihanolide<br>
glycoside; and to enhance the stability of the extract. The stability of extract is enhanced by<br>
concentrating the extract under vacuum and treating the residue with an aprotic organic<br>
solvent, e.g. chloroform to remove withanolide aglycones therefrom. Thereafter, the insoluble<br>
residue is dried below about 60DC, to provide a dry solid, and the solid so obtained, is<br>
pulverized under controlled temperature and humidity conditions. Aswagandha root and leaf<br>
thus extracted, is mixed with rice powder.<br>
Shrimp paste and small sea fish are churned with rice power, followed by kneading with salt<br>
(4.5-5% w/w) to form fish paste binder.<br>
A co rotating fully intermeshing twin screw extruder (Model No. PI Basic Technology Pvt. Ltd.<br>
Kolkata) is used (Screw Profile 12:1 Barrel length 336 mm; Barrel diameter 98 mm; Screw<br>
Diameter 28 mm; Conveying angle 30°; intermeshing screws, 24 mm apart).The treated<br>
material, textured by introduction into the induction nozzle, where the product temperature is<br>
elevated, is then cooled with cold water at the latter half of the induction nozzle, to lower the<br>
temperature of the textured treated material to 80D C. or below (at which temperature, the<br>
boiling of water is prevented). The textured treated material is taken out from the induction<br>
nozzle. Thus, a textured product having very good qualities, which is molded in a form<br>
conforming to the shape of the die is obtained.<br><br>
In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the extruder treatment<br>
conditions can vary, depending upon the kind of the raw materials to be treated. Such<br>
conditions may be selected from the following range: a temperature of from 80DC to 170DC,<br>
preferably in a moisture range from 10% -20%. It is preferable that such a treatment be<br>
carried out at a raw material-feeding rate of from 20 to 300 grams per minute while<br>
maintaining the screw speed, in the range of 400-450 r.p.m<br>
Extruded product having uniform qualities, is continuously obtained from the outlet of the<br>
extruder by treating the raw material by means of the extruder, as described above.<br>
Thus, by treating the material comprising one or more raw materials of marine products<br>
selected from the group consisting of fishes, shellfishes and a mixture of the raw material and<br>
by mixing the additives by means of the co-rotating twin-screw extruder, improved sea food<br>
based snack is obtained, which ensures acceptable mouth feeling herbal flavour, preservation<br>
of shelf life of crustaceans, exhibits low viscosity profile, no fragmentation in protein part,<br>
decrease of protein solubility and retains antioxidant property.<br>
This food product does not have the appearance and odour of fishes and shellfishes and<br>
seaweeds. While the food product can be enjoyably eaten as a low fat protein as it is, the food<br>
product can be also used as a raw material for hamburg steaks, hams or the like.<br>
Further, in the process, the raw material can be processed and treated for a short period of<br>
time by means of co rotating twin screw extruder having multiple functions without using<br>
exclusive machines each having a single function in each step. Thus, the present invention is<br>
economical and efficient.<br>
The following non-limiting examples illustrate the present invention. The process for the<br>
preparation of sea food comprises of the following steps:<br>
The shrimp powder, rice powder other vegetable protein flour is mixed with a mixture of small<br>
fish, aswagansdha extract in a predetermined proportion,<br>
The shrimp paste and small sea fish powder are mixed with binder at a definite ratio<br>
separately.<br><br>
The product obtained from step (i) &amp; step (ii) are mixed at different proportion given below to<br>
obtain the desired snacks:<br><br>
Table: 1 Product composition<br>
The mixture obtained from step (iii) is extruded, molded into the shape of pipe (expansion<br>
ratio 2.8) such as herein described to prepare desired shrimp like seafood product.<br>
The product is packed under vacuum or in inert gas medium.<br>
The present invention is further elaborately explained with reference to some specific non-<br>
limiting examples:<br>
Example - 1<br>
Shrimp Paste: A local variety shrimp Chapra (Penaeus indicus ) powder 10-50% w/w,<br>
Salt 5% w/w,<br>
Rice flour 50-90% w/w as mentioned herein and<br>
Water 10-20% w/w.<br>
Seafood is prepared by mixing the ingredients, in the proportion as mentioned in Table 1, in<br>
the extrusion condition barrel temperature range of 80DC-170DC<br>
The extruded product prepared, by applying this formulation had excellent puffing<br>
characteristics and excellent mouth feel. Further the product is found to be not only excellent<br>
in physical characteristics and form, but also in sensory properties. Furthermore, the product is<br>
found to have texture and taste, at the level of customer's satisfaction.<br><br>
Example - 2<br>
Shrimp Paste: A local variety shrimp Lali (Metapenaeopsis stridulans ) powder 10-50% w/w,<br>
Salt 5% w/w,<br>
Rice flour 50-90% w/w as mentioned herein and<br>
Water 10-20% w/w.<br>
Seafood is prepared by mixing the ingredients in the proportion as mentioned in Table 1, in the<br>
extrusion condition barrel temperature range of 80°C-170°C.<br>
The pipe like extruded product is slightly pressed into the form of a steak and thereafter fried<br>
