				<td>METHOD FOR RANDOM ACCESS IN WIRELESS COMMUNICATION SYSTEM,<br>
WIRELESS COMMUNICATION SYSTEM, WIRELESS TERMINAL, AND<br>
BASE STATION UNIT<br>
[Technical Field]<br>
The present invention relates to a method for random<br>
access in a wireless communication system, a wireless<br>
terminal, and a base station unit. The present invention<br>
is preferably used in the next-generation mobile<br>
communication system.<br>
[Background]<br>
For a mobile communication system such as mobile<br>
telephones, the third-generation scheme has started<br>
providing service through the use of CDMA scheme. The 3GPP<br>
(3rd Generation Partnership Project) (R) has been discussed<br>
over the next-generation mobile communication system (LTE:<br>
Long Term Evolution) which makes communication at a higher<br>
speed possible (see Non-Patent Document 1 below). In the<br>
project, reduction of delay in transmission is being<br>
discussed in addition to enhancement in transmission rate.<br>
In the event of initiation of communication between<br>
a base stat ion unit (evolved Node B : eNB) and a mobile station<br>
unit (User Equipment: UE) serving as a wireless terminal<br>
prepares in a mobile communication system, a channel is<br>
prepared through which the UE first transmits data. The<br>
3GPP calls this channel a random access channel (RACH) and<br>
calls a communication starting procedure using a RACH random<br>
access (see Non-Patent Document 2 below).<br>
A RACH includes minimum information that causes the<br>
eNB to recognize transmission from the UE . A RACH is used<br>
at the initiation of the communication and the subsequent<br>
communication uses an individual channel (or common<br>
channel) . A RACH can be shared by a number of UEs unless<br>
two or more UEs concurrently use the RACH. For the above,<br>
a RACH uses an identifier called a signature with which<br>
the eNB can identify UEs concurrently transmitting data<br>
through the RACH.<br>
Random access is carried out in the following four<br>
cases of: (1) transmission of first data; (2) establishment<br>
uplink synchronization when downlink data arrive; (3)<br>
request of uplink data transmission when uplink data arrive;<br>
and (4) establishment of synchronization with a destination<br>
base station when handover occurs. The direction from the<br>
eNB to the UE is defined as "downlink ( D L) ", and the reverse<br>
direction is defined as "uplink (UL)".<br>
Here, when (1) transmission of first data or when (3)<br>
transmission of uplink data, the UE randomly selects one<br>
signature from available signatures (preambles) and uses<br>
the selected signature (Contention Based Random Access<br>
Procedure) . Accordingly, there is a possibility, however<br>
being low, of two or more UEs concurrently transmit data<br>
using the same signature.<br>
Conversely, the eNB allocates a dedicated signature<br>
to the UE in advance when (2) transmission of downlink data.<br>
A possible collision of a signature may cause an<br>
instantaneous interruption of the connection or<br>
communication disconnection of the communication when (4)<br>
handover occurs. Therefore, a dedicated signature is<br>
allocated to the UE that is the subject of the handover<br>
(Non-contention Based Random Access Procedure).<br>
(a)Contention Based Random Access Procedure:<br>
Fig. 20 illustrates an example of a random access<br>
procedure used in the above cases (1) and (3) disclosed<br>
in the non-Patent Document 2.<br>
Upon uplink data arrival, the UE transmits a message<br>
(RandomAccess Preamble) #1-1 ( uplinktransmission request)<br>
containing a signature randomly selected to the eNB through<br>
the RACH (step S101) . At that time, there is a possibility<br>
of occurrence of a contention because two or more UEs<br>
concurrently start transmission through the use of the same<br>
signature. However, even when a contention occurs, the eNB<br>
cannot recognize the effective ID of each UE and cannot<br>
therefore grasp that the contention occurs between which<br>
UEs.<br>
Upon receipt of the message #1-1 (the signature) , the<br>
eNB reply with the response message (Random Access Response)<br>
#1-2 to the received message #1-1 (step S102) along with<br>
a timing advanced as synchronization signals for uplink<br>
communication , an uplink grant for transmission permission,<br>
and others. If a number of UEs 20 concurrently transmit<br>
requests through the RACH, the eNB 10 returns the response<br>
message #1-2 to the UEs 20.<br>
Next, theUE, which receives the response message # 1-2 ,<br>
transmits the ID of the UE itself via a message (Scheduled<br>
Transmission) #1-3 to request the eNB 10 to schedule UL<br>
communication to the eNB (step S103).<br>
Upon receipt of the message #1-3, the eNB recognizes<br>
the effective ID of the UE (hereinafter also called a terminal<br>
ID) and thereby can grasp that the contention of the signature<br>
occurs between which UEs. If a contention occurs, the eNB<br>
transmits message (Contention Resolution) #1-4 to the UEs<br>
in question to resolve the contention (step S104) .<br>
(b)Non-content ion Based Random Access Procedure<br>
Fig. 21 illustrates an example of a random access<br>
procedure (Non-contention Based Random Access Procedure)<br>
used in the above cases (2) and (4) disclosed in the<br>
Non-Patent Document 2.<br>
The eNB allocates a dedicated signature to each UE<br>
under the control of the eNB via a message (Random Access<br>
Preamble assignment) #2-1 in advance (step S20).<br>
The UE issues UL synchronization request to the eNB<br>
using the dedicated signature allocated by the eNB via the<br>
message #2-1. In other words, the UE transmits a message<br>
#2-2 containing a dedicated signature to the eNB through<br>
the RACH (step S202) .<br>
Upon receipt of the message #2-2, the eNB replies with<br>
the response message #2-3 to the received message (step<br>
S203) along with a timing advanced as synchronization signal,<br>
an uplink grant for transmission permission, and others.<br>

[Disclosure of Invention]<br>
[Problems to be Solved by Invention]<br>
As described above, since the non-Patent Document 2<br>
examines two kinds of procedure of random access, different<br>
procedures concurrently proceed in, for example, cases of<br>
(2)establishment uplink synchronization when downlink data<br>
arrive and (3) request of uplink data transmission when<br>
uplink data arrive.<br>
Since different procedures concurrently proceeding<br>
as the above requires respective resources (such as<br>
signature), two kinds of signature are allocated while the<br>
procedures are proceeding so that the signatures are wasted.<br>
One of the objects of the present invention is to<br>
selectively perform one among a number of kinds of random<br>
access.<br>
Another object is to efficiently use resources such<br>
as signatures to be used for random access.<br>
Besides the above objects, the remaining objects can<br>
be derived from the configuration of an embodiment that<br>
will be detailed below, but cannot be attained by the prior<br>
techniques.<br>
[Means to Solve the Problem]<br>

second random access in response to generation of downlink<br>
data from the base station unit before creating first<br>
information used for first random access in response to<br>
generation of uplink data destined for the base station<br>
unit, transmitting third information, which is transmitted<br>
to the base station unit during the first random access,<br>
to the base station unit during or after the completion<br>
of the second random access using the second information.<br>

[Best Modes to Carry Out the Invention]<br>
Hereinafter, an embodiment of the present invention<br>
will now be described with reference to the drawings.<br>
However, the present invention is not limited to the<br>
embodiments to be detailed below and, needless to say, can<br>
be variously modified without departing from the gist of<br>
the present invention.<br>
(1) first embodiment:<br>
Fig. 1 is a functional block diagram of a base station<br>
unit (eNB) according to the first embodiment of the present<br>
invention; and Fig. 2 is a functional block diagram of a<br>
mobile station unit (UE) according to the first embodiment<br>
of the present invention. The eNB 10 and the UE 20 form<br>
a wireless communication system. The wireless<br>
communication system can include a number of eNBs 10 and<br>
a number of UEs 20. The configurations illustrated in Figs.<br>
1 and 2 are also common to second through fourth embodiments<br>
detailed below unless otherwise specified. In addition,<br>
the base station unit 10 of the first embodiment assumes<br>
to be an LTE eNB which possesses a part of or the entire<br>
function of a radio network controller (RNC), but may be<br>
a base station of a former generation of the LET (i.e.,<br>
without the function of RNC) . In addition, the base station<br>
may comply with any system as long as adopting both the<br>
contention based random access procedure and the<br>
non-contention based random access procedure.<br>
(description of eNB)<br>
Focusing on the major functions, the eNB 10 illustrated<br>
in Fig. 1 includes, for example, an antenna 11, a<br>
transmitting/receiving unit, a buffering unit 13, a judging<br>
unit 14, a signaturemanaging unit 15, and a wireless resource<br>
managing unit 16.<br>
Here, the antenna 11 receives an uplink wireless signal<br>
from the UE 20 while transmits downlink wireless signal<br>
to the UE 20. The antenna 11 is commonly used for<br>
transmitting and receiving, but alternatively an antenna<br>
for transmitting may be separated from an antenna for<br>
receiving.<br>
The transmitting/receiving unit (transmitting means,<br>
receiving means) 12 performs predetermined receiving<br>
processing on an uplink wireless signal received by the<br>
antenna 11 while performs predetermined transmitting<br>
processing on data (downlink data) from the buffering unit<br>
13.<br>
The receiving processing includes, for example,<br>
low-noise amplification, frequency conversion<br>
(down-conversion) to the baseband frequency, gain<br>
adjustment, demodulation by a predetermined demodulating<br>
scheme, and decoding by a predetermined decoding scheme.<br>
The transmitting processing includes encoding of the uplink<br>
transmission data by a predetermined encoding scheme,<br>
modulating of the encoded data by a predetermined modulating<br>
scheme (such as QPSK or 16QAM) , creating of a predetermined<br>
wireless frame, frequency conversion (up-conversion) to<br>
the radio frequency, and electric power amplification. The<br>
above wireless frame is exemplified by one conforming to<br>
OFDMA, OFDMA, or others.<br>
The buffering unit 13 temporarily stores downlink data<br>
destined for the UE 20 under the control of the signature<br>
managing unit 15. The judging unit (determining means) 14<br>
has a function of determining which signature was selected<br>
between a random signature and a dedicated signature<br>
through judging, on the basis of uplink data (message)<br>
subjected to receiving processing in the<br>
transmitting/receiving unit 12, whether or not an UL<br>
synchronization request or an UL scheduling request is<br>
issued from the UE 20.<br>
In the first embodiment, a random signature represents<br>
a signature (first information) that the UE 20 randomly<br>
creates and a dedicated signature represents a signature<br>
(second information) that the eNB 10 allocates (sends) to<br>
the UE 20. The detailed method for the judgment will be<br>
described below.<br>
The signature managing unit (managing means) 15<br>
manages a signature (Random Access Preamble, hereinafter<br>
also called a preamble) used for random access (procedure) ,<br>
creates a downlink message destined for the UE 20 and used<br>
for random access, and has a function of allocating and<br>
releasing a signature for the UE 20. The release is based<br>
on the result of the judgment by the judging unit 14.<br>
The wireless resource managing unit 16 manages UL and<br>
DL wireless resources (e.g. channel frequency and time<br>
(transmitting/receiving timings)) to be used for<br>
communication (including communication when random<br>
accessing) with the UE 20 and allocation of the resources.<br>
For example, when OFDMA is adopted, the wireless resource<br>
managing unit 16 has a function to manage the mapping of<br>
a two-dimensional transmitting/receiving region (called<br>
a burst) defined in terms of the sub-channel frequency and<br>
the symbol time.<br>
In addition, the wireless resource managing unit 16<br>
has a function as controlling means that carries out control<br>
based on an uplink message (third information) which is<br>
received from the UE 20 during random access corresponding<br>
to the signature that is not selected by the UE 20.<br>
(description of UE)<br>
Focusing on the major functions, the UE 20 illustrated<br>
in Fig. 2 includes, for example, an antenna 21, a<br>
transmitting/receiving unit 22, a buffering unit 23, a<br>
signature managing unit 24, an access judging unit 25, and<br>
an identifier providing unit 26.<br>
Here, the antenna 21 receives a downlink wireless<br>
signal from the eNB 10 while transmits an uplink wireless<br>
signal to the eNB 10. Also the antenna 21 is commonly used<br>
for transmitting and receiving, but alternatively, an<br>
antenna for transmitting may be separated from an antenna<br>
for receiving.<br>
The transmitting/receiving unit (transmitting means,<br>
receiving means) 22 performs predetermined receiving<br>
processing on a downlink wireless signal received by the<br>
antenna 21 while performs predetermined transmitting<br>
processing on data (uplink data) from the buffering unit<br>
23 and on an uplink message (e.g., a Random Access Preamble<br>
and a Scheduled Transmission message) destined for an eNB<br>
via the identifier providing unit 26.<br>
The receiving processing by the UE 20 also includes,<br>
for example, low-noise amplification, frequency conversion<br>
(down-conversion) to the baseband frequency, gain<br>
adjustment, demodulation by a predetermined demodulating<br>
scheme, and decoding by a predetermined decoding scheme.<br>
The transmitting processing includes encoding of the uplink<br>
transmission data by a predetermined encoding scheme,<br>
modulating of the encoded data by a predetermined modulating<br>
scheme (such as QPSK or 16QAM), multiplexing (mapping) of<br>
uplink data to a predetermined wireless frame, frequency<br>
conversion (up-conversion) to the radio frequency, and<br>
electric power amplification.<br>
The buffering unit 23 temporarily stores uplink data<br>
destined for the eNB 10 under the control of the signature<br>
managing unit 24, which manages a signature (Random Access<br>
Preamble) used for random access processing (procedure) .<br>
The access judging unit 25 generates a predetermined<br>
message to be used for the random access procedure in<br>
cooperation with the signature managing unit 24. In this<br>
example, the access judging unit 25 has a function of<br>
monitoring (confirming) whether or not multiple allocation<br>
of signatures occurs, that is, whether or not a dedicated<br>
signature allocated by the eNB 10 and a random signature<br>
randomly created by the UE 20 itself (by the signature<br>
managing unit 24) exist and in the event of occurrence<br>
multiple allocation, determining which signature is made<br>
to be effective.<br>
The identifier providing unit 26 has a function of<br>
providing an uplink message (e.g., a message informing of<br>
the terminal ID) which is destined for the eNB 10 and which<br>
is generated by the access judging unit 25 with information<br>
(an identifier, a flag, or the like) indicating that the<br>
uplink message also serves as a message that requests to<br>
transmit an uplink data (UL scheduling) because also uplink<br>
data is being generated at the UE 20 or that the uplink<br>
message serves as UL synchronization confirmation<br>
responsive an UL synchronization requests required for<br>
receiving downlink data because downlink data arrives at<br>
the eNB 10. The UL synchronization confirmation is a<br>
notification (confirmation response) to the eNB 10 that<br>
the UE 2 0 secures UL synchronization due to correct receiving<br>
UL timing information from the eNB 10.<br>
(description of a random access procedure)<br>
Hereinafter, detailed description will now be made<br>
in relation to an operation (a random access procedure)<br>
in a wireless communication system of the first embodiment<br>
having the above configuration with reference to Figs. 3<br>
through 5. Fig. 3 is a sequence diagram explaining the<br>
random access procedure (method) of the first embodiment;<br>
Fig. 4 is a flow diagram explaining the operation of the<br>
eNB 10 when the random access procedure of the first<br>
embodiment is being carried out; and Fig. 5 is a flow diagram<br>
explaining the operation of the UE 20 when the random access<br>
procedure of the first embodiment is being carried out.<br>
Hereinafter, similarly to the description of Figs.<br>
20 and 21, the messages with the reference numbers #1-1<br>
through #1-4 represents messages originally used for the<br>
contention based random access procedure (first random<br>
access) andmessages with the reference numbers #2-1 through<br>
#2-3 originally used for the non-contention based random<br>
access procedure (second random access) .<br>
First of all, when the UE 20 generates uplink data<br>
and the buffering unit 23 stores the uplink data (step Bl<br>
in Fig. 5) , the UE 20 generates and stores a random signature<br>
(Random Access Preamble) at the signature managing unit<br>
24 (step B2 in Fig. 5) . Namely, the signature managing unit<br>
24 has a function as creating means that creates a signature<br>
to be used for the contention based random access, which<br>
is executed when uplink data destined for the eNB 10 is<br>
generated.<br>
After that, the UE 20 creates a random access preamble<br>
message (uplink transmission request) #1-1 containing the<br>
created signature at the access judging unit 2 5 and transmits<br>
the created message to the eNB 10 from the antenna 21 via<br>
the transmitting/receiving unit 22 (step S1a of Fig. 3 and<br>
step B3 in Fig. 5).<br>
Upon receipt of the uplink transmission request<br>
message #1-1, the eNB 10 replies with a response message<br>
(Random Access Response) #1-2 responsive to the received<br>
uplink transmission request message #1-1 (step S2 in Fig.<br>
3) along with a timing advanced as synchronization message<br>
for uplink communication, an uplink grant for transmission<br>
permission, and others. If a number of UEs 20 concurrently<br>
transmit requests through the RACH, the eNB 10 returns the<br>
response message #1-2 to the UEs 20.<br>
Here, presuming that the eNB 10 could not recognize<br>
the uplink transmission request message #1-1 that the UE<br>
20 transmits because downlink data destined for the UE 20<br>
arrived at the eNB 10 from the upper apparatus (i.e., the<br>
buffering unit 13 stores downlink data) before the<br>
transmission of the response message #1-2 (step A1 in Fig.<br>
4) and the eNB 10 does not complete the receiving process<br>
on the downlink data.<br>
In this case, the signature managing unit 15 of the<br>
eNB 10 creates and stores a signature (dedicated signature,<br>
the second information) that the UE 20 that is the destination<br>
of the downlink data uses for random access (UL<br>
synchronization request) (step A2 in Fig. 4) , and transmits<br>
the dedicated signature to the UE 20 through the use of<br>
a signature allocation message (RA Preamble Assignment)<br>
#2-1 (step S1b in Fig. 3 and step A3 in Fig. 4).<br>
When transmission of the uplink transmission request<br>
message #1-1 (step Slain Fig. 3) and the signature allocation<br>
message #2-1 (step S1b in Fig. 3) is completed, the eNB<br>
10 cannot recognize "which UE 20 uses which signature".<br>
In other words, the eNB 10 cannot recognize that the two<br>
signatures (Random Preamble and Dedicated Preamble) are<br>
issued for which UE 20 because according to Non-Patent<br>
Document 2, either message does not contain information<br>
(terminal ID) to identify the UE 20.<br>
According to Non-Patent Document 2, since the terminal<br>
ID can be contained in a message (Scheduled Transmission)<br>
#1-3, the eNB 10 grasps which UE 20 uses which signature<br>
after the receipt of the message #1-3 from the UE 20 (step<br>
S3 in Fig. 3).<br>
Conversely, regardless of whether or not the UE 20<br>
notifies the terminal ID of the UE 20 itself to the eNB<br>
10, when transmission of the uplink transmission request<br>
message #1-2 ( st ep S1a in Fig . 3) and the s ignature allocation<br>
message #2-1 (step S1b in Fig. 3) is completed, both the<br>
random signature created by the UE 20 it self and the dedicated<br>
signature (Dedicated Preamble) allocated by the eNB 10 exist<br>
in the UE 20, in other words , the UE 20 can recognize (detect)<br>
occurrence of the two kinds of random access.<br>
If a number of signatures are issued for a single UE<br>
20 as the above case, the UE 20 determines which signature<br>
is to be used. Specifically, when the UE 20 receives<br>
(allocation of) a dedicated signature from the eNB 10 from<br>
the step S2 (step B4 in Fig. 5), the access judging unit<br>
25 confirms, in cooperation with the signature managing<br>
unit 24, whether or not multiple allocation of two signatures<br>
(preambles) occurs (step B5 in Fig. 5).<br>
The confirmation concluded occurrence of multiple<br>
allocation (yes route in step B5), the UE 20 (the access<br>
judging unit 25) ignores the dedicated signature allocated<br>
by the eNB 10 (step S1c in Fig. 3 and step B6 in Fig. 5),<br>
and selects the random signature created by the UE 20 itself<br>
as an effective signature. In other words, the access<br>
judging unit 25 has a function of selecting means which<br>
selects one between the two signatures. In addition, when<br>
no multiple allocation occurs, the UE 20 determines the<br>
random signature created by the UE 20 itself to be effective<br>
(no route in step B5).<br>
Thereby, the random access procedure (content ion based<br>
random access procedure) using the random signature created<br>
by the UE 20 becomes effective, so that the UE 20 continues<br>
the contention based random access procedure.<br>
In other words, the UE 20 creates a message #1-3 and<br>
transmits the message to the eNB 10 (step S3 in Fig. 3 and<br>
step B7 in Fig. 5). At that time, the UE 20 grasps, through<br>
receiving the signature allocation message #2-1, that the<br>
downlink data destined for the UE 20 itself arrives at the<br>
eNB 10, and therefore transmits the message #1-3 to the<br>
eNB 10 preferably after providing the message with<br>
information (such as an identifier or a flag) indicating<br>
that "the message #1-3 also serves as UL synchronization<br>
confirmation required for receiving downlink data". UL<br>
synchronization confirmation is a confirmation response<br>
that UL synchronization is secured because the UE 20<br>
correctly receives UL timing information contained in the<br>
message (Random access Response) #1-2.<br>
In other words, UL synchronization request (third<br>
information), which is transmitted to the eNB 10 during<br>
the non-contention random access which is however not<br>
selected, is a message to receive UL timing information<br>
from the eNB 10 for UL synchronization, but the UE 20 already<br>
obtains the timing information during the contention based<br>
random access (#1-2). For the above, the UE 20 provides<br>
UL synchronization confirmation informing eNB 10 of<br>
securing of UL synchronization to the message #1-3 to be<br>
transmitted and then transmits the message #1-3.<br>
However, as described above, since the eNB 10<br>
recognizes the UE 20 to which two signatures are allocated<br>
at the time of receiving the message #1-3, the eNB 10 can<br>
implicitly judge that the message #1-3 also serves as a<br>
UL synchronization request even when the identifier or a<br>
flag is not explicitly provided.<br>
Upon recognition of receiving the message (also<br>
serving as UL synchronization confirmation) #1-3 (yes route<br>
of step A4 in Fig. 4), the eNB 10 judges in the judging<br>
unit 14 that the dedicated signature allocated to the UE<br>
20 is ignored in the same UE 20 (that is, the random signature<br>
created by the UE 20 is preferentially selected) and<br>
consequently releases the dedicated signature allocated<br>
to the same UE 20 in the signature managing unit 15 (step<br>
S3-1 in Fig. 3 and step A5 in Fig. 4).<br>
Accordingly, the random access procedure (the<br>
non-contention based random access procedure) using the<br>
dedicated signature allocated by the eNB 10 is halted, so<br>
that the dedicated signature allocated to the UE 20 can<br>
be released during the random access procedure (at an early<br>
stage), which makes it possible to efficiently use<br>
signatures. Here, if the message #1-3 is determined not<br>
to also serve as UL synchronization confirmation (no route<br>
in step S4), the downlink data does not arrive and only<br>
normal uplink communication occurs, so that the eNB 10<br>
transmits a message #1-4 (step A7).<br>
The eNB 10 starts processing (control), such as<br>
scheduling of downlink data, based on the UL synchronization<br>
confirmation (third information) in the wireless resource<br>
managing unit 16 (step A6 in Fig. 4).<br>
By receiving of the message (also serving as UL<br>
synchronization confirmation) #1-3, the eNB 10 can<br>
recognize that the response (Random Access Preamble) to<br>
the signature allocation message #2-1 from the UE 20 can<br>
be omitted, so that unnecessary retransmission of the<br>
signature allocation message #2-1 can be avoided. Further,<br>
reception of the message #1-3 used for the contention based<br>
random access procedure, despite allocation of the<br>
dedicated signature, makes the eNB 10 possible to recognize<br>
generation of uplink data at the UE 20.<br>
Since the eNB 10 grasps the effective ID of the UE<br>
20 through receiving the message (also serving as UL<br>
synchronization confirmation) #1-3, so that the eNB 10 can<br>
recognize that the contention occurred between which UEs.<br>
The contention can be resolved by transmitting a Contention<br>
Resolution message #1-4 to the UEs 20 in question (step<br>
S4 in Fig. 3).<br>
As described above, in the method of random access<br>
of the first embodiment, even when uplink data and downlink<br>
data arrive in the same UE 20, the UE 20 selects the signature<br>
the UE 20 itself created and thereby the contention based<br>
random access is continued. Consequently, the two kinds<br>
of random access procedure do not concurrently proceed for<br>
a single UE 20 until the last stage as denoted in Fig. 6.<br>
Accordingly, the control plane of the random access can<br>
be simplified and signatures used for random access can<br>
be efficiently used. In addition, the interference of the<br>
random access channel can be inhibited.<br>
However, the two kind of random access procedure can<br>
be concurrently proceeded. Accordingly, for example, in<br>
the event that the message (UL synchronization<br>
confirmation) #1-3 is contend with another UE, the UE 20<br>
recognizes occurrence of the contention with reference to<br>
the Contention Resolution message #1-4 notified from the<br>
eNB 10. In this case, since continuation of the<br>
non-contention based random access may require a time to<br>
secure UL synchronization, the contention based random<br>
access can be concurrently executed through the use of a<br>
dedicated signature allocated in the message #2-1 by eNB<br>
10. However, the expirat ion period of a dedicated signature<br>
for the UE 20 needs to be set to be long in that case.<br>
Since the information (UL synchronization<br>
confirmation) which is transmitted to the eNB 10 during<br>
the non-contention based random access that is not selected<br>
is transmitted to eNB 10 during the contention based random<br>
access, the reception processing of downlink data can be<br>
surely carried out along with the transmitting processing<br>
on uplink data.<br>
Further, since the UL synchronization confirmation<br>
can be common to the uplink message #1-3 that is originally<br>
determined to be transmitted to the eNB 10 during the<br>
contention based random access that is selected, there is<br>
no need to prepare (define) an unlink message dedicated<br>
to UL synchronization confirmation, so that the wireless<br>
resource can be efficiently used.<br>
Further, since the first embodiment can reduce the<br>
number of messages that are communicated between the eNB<br>
10 and the UE 20 as compared with a second embodiment to<br>
be detailed below, it is possible to efficiently use the<br>
wireless resource and to shorten error recovery with the<br>
use of retransmission control (HARQ: Hybrid Automatic<br>
Repeat reQuest).<br>
(2) second embodiment:<br>
Fig. 7 is a sequence diagram illustrating a random<br>
access procedure according to the second embodiment; Fig.<br>
8 is a flow diagram explaining the operation of eNB 10 during<br>
the random access procedure of the second embodiment; and<br>
Fig. 9 is a flow diagram explaining the operation of UE<br>
20 during the random access procedure of the second<br>
embodiment.<br>
In the second embodiment, in the event of occurrence<br>
of multiple allocation of the preambles, the UE 20 ignores<br>
thesignature ( first information) created by the UE 20 itself<br>
and selects the dedicated signature (second information)<br>
allocated by the eNB 10 . Thereby, the non-content ion based<br>
random access procedure continues.<br>
First of all, when uplink data arrive in the UE 20<br>
and is stored in the buffering unit 23 (step B11 in Fig.<br>
9), the UE 20 creates and stores a random signature (Random<br>
Access Preamble) at the signature managing unit 24 (step<br>
B12 in Fig. 9), creates an uplink transmission request<br>
(Random Access Preamble) message #1-1 containing the<br>
signature at the access judging unit 25, and transmits the<br>
message #1-1 from the antenna 21 via the<br>
transmitting/receiving unit 22 (step S1a in Fig. 7 and step<br>
B13 in Fig. 9).<br>
Upon receipt of the uplink transmission request<br>
message #1-1, the eNB 10 replies with a response message<br>
(Random Access Response) #1-2 to the received uplink<br>
transmission request message (step S2 in Fig. 7) along with<br>
a timing advanced for synchronization signal for uplink<br>
communication, an uplink grant for transmission permission,<br>
and others. If a number of UEs 20 concurrently transmit<br>
requests through the RACH, the eNB 10 returns the response<br>
message #1-2 to the UEs 20.<br>
Here, also in the second embodiment presumes that the<br>
eNB 10 could not recognize the uplink transmission request<br>
message #1-1 transmitted by the UE 20 because downlink data<br>
destined for the UE 20 arrived at the eNB 10 from the upper<br>
apparatus (i.e., the buffering unit 13 stores downlink data)<br>
before the transmission of the response message #1-2 (step<br>
All in Fig. 8) and the eNB 10 does not complete the receiving<br>
process on the downlink data.<br>
In this case, the signature managing unit 15 of the<br>
eNB 10 creates and stores a signature (dedicated signature)<br>
that the UE 20 that is the destination of the downlink data<br>
uses for random access (UL synchronization request) (step<br>
A12 in Fig. 8), and transmits the dedicated signature to<br>
the UE 20 through the use of a signature allocation message<br>
(RA Preamble Assignment) #2-1 (step S1b in Fig. 7 and step<br>
A13 in Fig. 8).<br>
The UE 20, which receives the signature allocation<br>
message #2-1, transmits, to the eNB 10 through the RACH,<br>
a message (Random Access Preamble) #2-2 containing the<br>
dedicated signature allocated by the eNB 10.(step S2a in<br>
Fig. 7).<br>
Here, when transmission of the uplink transmission<br>
request message #1-1(step S1a in Fig. 7) and signature<br>
allocation message #2-1(step S1b in Fig. 7) is completed,<br>
the UE 20 can recognizes the presence of both the random<br>
signature created by the UE 20 itself and the dedicated<br>
signature allocated by the eNB 10.<br>
Therefore, the UE 20 judges which signature is to be<br>
used. In other words, when the eNB 10 allocates a signature<br>
from step S2 (step B14 in Fig. 9), the UE 20 of the second<br>
embodiment confirms, in cooperation with the signature<br>
managing unit 24, whether or not multiple allocation of<br>
two signatures (preambles) is occurring (step B15 in Fig.<br>
9).<br>
As a result, when multiple allocation is occurring<br>
(yes route in step B15) , the UE 20 ignores the random access<br>
signature created by the UE 20 itself (the signature<br>
transmitted to the eNB 10) (step S1d in Fig. 7 and step<br>
B16 in Fig. 9), and selects the dedicated signature allocated<br>
by the eNB 10 as an effective signature. When multiple<br>
allocation is not occurring, the dedicated signature is<br>
made effective (no route in step B15).<br>
Consequently, the random access procedure (the<br>
non-contention based random access procedure) through the<br>
use of the dedicated signature allocated by the eNB 10<br>
continues.<br>
After that, the UE 20 creates the message #1-3 and<br>
transmits the created message to the eNB 10 (step S3 in<br>
Fig. 7 and step B17 in Fig. 9) . Concurrently, since also<br>
uplink data arrive, the UE 20 provides the message #1-3<br>
with information (an identifier or a flag) indicating that<br>
the message #1-3 also "serves as a message (UL scheduling<br>
request) to request transmission (scheduling) of unlink<br>
data" by the identifier providing unit 26 and transmits<br>
the message #1-3 to the eNB 10.<br>
In other words, UL scheduling request (third<br>
information), which is transmitted to the eNB 10 during<br>
the contention random access, which is not selected, is<br>
provided to the message #1-3 destined for the eNB 10 and<br>
is transmitted to the eNB 10.<br>
However, as described above, since the eNB 10<br>
recognizes a UE 20 to which two signatures are allocated<br>
at the time of receiving the message #1-3, the eNB 10 can<br>
implicitly judge that the message #1-3 from the UE 20 also<br>
serves as a UL scheduling request even when the identifier<br>
or a flag is not explicitly provided.<br>
Upon recognition of receiving the message (also<br>
serving as UL scheduling request) #1-3 (yes route of step<br>
A14 in Fig. 8), the eNB 10 judges that the UE 20 makes the<br>
dedicated signature allocated by the eNB 10 to the UE 20<br>
effective, and releases the random signature which the eNB<br>
10 manages and which is received from the UE 20 in the<br>
signature managing unit 15 (step S3-2 in Fig. 7 and step<br>
A15 in Fig. 8).<br>
Consequently, the random access procedure (the<br>
contention based random access) through the use of the random<br>
signature created by the UE 20 becomes ineffective (halts) ,<br>
so that the dedicated signature can be released during the<br>
random access procedure (at an early stage), which makes<br>
it possible to efficiently use signatures.<br>
In the eNB 10, the wireless resource managing unit<br>
16 carries out processing (control) of allocation of UL<br>
wireless resource in response to the UL scheduling request<br>
(step A16 in Fig. 8). Since the second embodiment makes<br>
the dedicated signature effective, there is no need to<br>
transmit Contention Resolution message #1-4 used for the<br>
contention based random access procedure to the UE 20 in<br>
question and therefore the transmission can be halted (step<br>
S4 in Fig. 7 and step A17 in Fig. 8) . In addition, if the<br>
eNB 10 judges that the message #1-3 does not serve as the<br>
UL scheduling request, the eNB 10 terminates the processing<br>
(no route in step A14 in Fig. 8).<br>
As describe above, according to the method of random<br>
access of the second embodiment, even when uplink data and<br>
downlink data concurrently arrive in the same UE 20, the<br>
UE 20 selects the signature allocated by the eNB 10 and<br>
thereby the non-content ion based random access is continued.<br>
Consequently, the two kinds of random access procedure do<br>
not concurrently proceed until the last. Accordingly, the<br>
control plane of the random access can be simplified and<br>
signatures used for random access can be efficiently used.<br>
In addition, the interference of the RACH can be inhibited.<br>
Since the information (UL scheduling request) which<br>
is transmitted to the eNB 10 during the contention based<br>
random access that is not selected is transmitted to eNB<br>
10 during the contention based random access, the reception<br>
processing of downlink data can be surely carried out along<br>
with the transmitting processing on uplink data.<br>
Further, when the UL scheduling request to the eNB<br>
10 is common to the uplink message #1-3, there is no need<br>
to prepare (define) an unlink message dedicated to UL<br>
scheduling request, so that the wireless resource can be<br>
efficiently used.<br>
The first and the second embodiments assume that the<br>
eNB 10 transmits the signature allocation request message<br>
#2-1 to the UE 20 after the UE 20 transmits the uplink<br>
transmission request message #1-1. However, even when<br>
these messages #1-1 and #2-1 are transmitted in the reverse<br>
order, multiple allocation also occurs so that it is<br>
sufficient that either one of the signatures is made<br>
effective.<br>
(2.1) first modification:<br>
The above message also serving as UL scheduling request<br>
to the eNB 10 may be a message (Random Access Preamble)<br>
#2-2 transmitted in step S2a in Fig. 7 as denoted in the<br>
example Fig. 10.<br>
In this case, the UE 20 needs not transmit the message<br>
#1-3 and can consequently halt the transmission of the<br>
message #1-3 (step S3). Accordingly, unnecessary<br>
transmission of uplink messages can be avoided so that<br>
efficiently use of uplink wireless resource (band) can be<br>
ensured.<br>
Since the eNB 1 0 cannot recognize (i.e., cannot manage)<br>
that which UE 20 uses which preamble unless receives the<br>
message #1-3, there is no need to release the preamble (no<br>
need to carry out step S3-2 in Fig 7). Consequently, it<br>
is possible to reduce the processing load of the preamble<br>
management on the eNB 10.<br>
(2.2) second embodiment:<br>
Further, alternative to transmitting the UL scheduling<br>
request to the eNB 10 during the non-contention based random<br>
access procedure, the UL scheduling request may be, as<br>
denoted in Fig. 11, transmitted along with the response<br>
(ACK/NACK signal) responsive to the message #2-3 upon<br>
completion of the procedure (step S5 in Fig. 11). Further<br>
alternatively, the request may be transmitted in the form<br>
of an independent uplink message after the transmission<br>
of the message #2-3.<br>
(3) third embodiment:<br>
Fig. 12 is a sequence diagram illustrating a random<br>
access procedure according to the third embodiment; Fig.<br>
13 is a flow diagram explaining the operation of eNB 10<br>
during the random access procedure of the third embodiment;<br>
and Fig. 14 is a flow diagram explaining the operation of<br>
UE 20 during the random access procedure of the third<br>
embodiment.<br>
Differently from the first and the second embodiments,<br>
description of the third embodiment presumes that uplink<br>
data arrive in the UE 20 under a state where a dedicated<br>
signature is allocated to the UE 20.<br>
In other words, when downlink data which is destined<br>
for the UE 20 and which is transmitted from the upper<br>
apparatus arrives at the eNB 10 (i.e., the buffering unit<br>
13 stores downlink data) (step A21 in Fig. 13), the eNB<br>
10 creates and stores a signature (dedicated signature)<br>
(step A22 in Fig. 13) that is to be used for random access<br>
(UL synchronization request) by the UE 20, the destination<br>
of the downlink data (step A2 in Fig. 13) , and then transmits<br>
the created signature by means of a signature allocation<br>
message #2-1 (RA Preamble Assignment) to the destination<br>
UE 20 through the transmitting/receiving unit 12 (step All<br>
in Fig. 12 and step A23 in Fig. 13).<br>
Upon receipt of the signature allocation message #2-1,<br>
the UE 20 stores and manages the dedicated signature<br>
allocated by the received message in the signature managing<br>
unit 24 (step B21 in Fig. 14).<br>
After that, when UE 20 generates uplink data and the<br>
buffering unit 23 stores the uplink data (step B22 in Fig.<br>
14), the UE 20 (the signature managing unit 24) does not<br>
generates a random signature (step S12 in Fig. 12 and step<br>
B23 in Fig. 14) differently from the first and the second<br>
embodiments .<br>
As the substitute, the UE 20 creates, in the access<br>
judging unit 25, an UL synchronization request (Random<br>
Access Preamble) message #2-2 containing the dedicated<br>
signature allocated by eNB10 and transmits the created<br>
message to the eNB 10 through the transmitting/receiving<br>
unit 22 from the antenna 21.<br>
At that time, because of the generation of the uplink<br>
message, the UE 20 provides information (an identifier or<br>
a flag) indicating that "the message also serves as an UL<br>
scheduling request" to the message #2-2 in the identifier<br>
providing unit 26 and transmits the message to the eNB 10<br>
(step S13 in Fig. 12 and step B24 in Fig. 14).<br>
In other words, the UE 20 additionally transmits the<br>
UL scheduling request to the eNB 19 (sic, correctly 10)<br>
in the event of executing random access through the use<br>
of a signature for obtaining (establishing) the uplink<br>
synchronization when downlink data is generated.<br>
Upon confirmation of the reception of the message #2-2<br>
(also serving as UL scheduling request) (yes route in step<br>
A24 in Fig. 13), the eNB 10 causes the wireless resource<br>
managing unit 16 to control allocation of the UL resource<br>
corresponding to the UL scheduling request (step A25 in<br>
Fig. 13) and creates the signature managing unit 15 to create<br>
a response message #2-3 to the message #2-2 and transmit<br>
the created message to the UE 20 (step S14 in Fig. 12).<br>
Conversely, since an UL synchronization request message<br>
#2-2 not containing the UL scheduling request (no route<br>
in step A24 in Fig. 13) represents a case in which a normal<br>
uplink data communication is arriving, the eNB 10 transmits<br>
the message #2-3 without allocation of an UL resource (step<br>
A26 in Fig. 13).<br>
As described above, according to the method of random<br>
access of the third embodiment, after downlink data destined<br>
for a UE 20 arrive at eNB 10 and responsively allocates<br>
a signature to the same UE 20, the UE 20 does not generate<br>
a signature used for the contention based random access,<br>
but does continue the non-contention based random access<br>
using the signature allocated by the eNB 10 . Consequently,<br>
the two kinds of random access do not concurrently proceed.<br>
Accordingly, the control plane of the random access<br>
can be simplified and signatures used for random access<br>
can be efficiently used. In addition, both the UE 20 and<br>
the eNB 10 do not have to always manage the two kinds of<br>
signature.<br>
Further, since, during the non-content ion based random<br>
access, information (UL scheduling request), which is<br>
transmitted to the eNB 10 during the contention based random<br>
access, is transmitted to the eNB 10, the transmitting<br>
processing of the uplink data can be surely carried out<br>
along with the receiving processing of the downlink data.<br>
Still further, the random access preamble message #2-2<br>
also serves as an UL scheduling request, delay until the<br>
start of transmitting uplink data can be reduced as compared<br>
with the following fourth embodiment (in which a<br>
confirmation response message to the random access response<br>
message #2-3 also serves as the UL scheduling request).<br>
(4) fourth embodiment:<br>
Fig. 15 is a sequence diagram illustrating a random<br>
access procedure according to the fourth embodiment; Fig.<br>
16 is a flow diagram explaining the operation of eNB 10<br>
during the random access procedure of the fourth embodiment ;<br>
and Fig. 17 is a flow diagram explaining the operation of<br>
UE 20 during the random access procedure of the fourth<br>
embodiment.<br>
Similarly to the third embodiment, the fourth<br>
embodiment presumes that the UE 20 generates uplink data<br>
under a state where a dedicated signature is previously<br>
allocated to the UE 20.<br>
In other words, when downlink data which is destined<br>
for the UE 20 and which is transmitted from the upper<br>
apparatus arrives at the eNB 10 (i.e., the buffering unit<br>
13 stores downlink data) (step A31 in Fig. 16), the eNB<br>
10 creates and stores at the signature managing unit 15<br>
a signature (dedicated signature) (step A32 in Fig. 16)<br>
that is to be used for random access (UL synchronization<br>
request) by the UE 20, the destination of the downlink data,<br>
and then transmits the created signature by means of a<br>
signature allocation message #2-1 (RA Preamble Assignment)<br>
to the UE 20 through the transmitting/receiving unit 12<br>
(step S11 in Fig. 15 and step A33 in Fig. 16).<br>
Upon receipt of the signature al location mes sage #2-1,<br>
the UE 20 stores and manages the dedicated signature<br>
allocated by the received message in the signature managing<br>
unit 24 (step B31 in Fig. 17).<br>
After that, UE 20 generates uplink data and the<br>
buffering unit 23 stores the uplink data (step B32 in Fig.<br>
17), the UE 20 (the signature managing unit 24) does not<br>
generate a random signature (step S12 in Fig. 15 and step<br>
B33 in Fig. 17) differently from the first and the second<br>
embodiments.<br>
As the substitute, the UE 20 creates a message #2-2<br>
(Random Access Preamble) containing the dedicated signature<br>
allocated by eNB10 in the access judging unit 25, and<br>
transmits the message to the eNB 10 through the<br>
transmitting/receiving unit 22 from the antenna 21 (step<br>
S13 in Fig. 15 and step B34 in Fig. 17).<br>
Upon recognizing reception of the message #2-2 (yes<br>
route in step A34 in Fig. 16) , the eNB 10 causes the wireless<br>
resource managing unit 16 to allocate the UL wireless<br>
resource (step A35 in Fig. 16) and causes the signature<br>
managing unit 15 to create a response message #2-3 to the<br>
message #2-2 and transmit the created message to the UE<br>
20 (step S14 in Fig. 15). Conversely, if the eNB 10 cannot<br>
recognize the reception of the message #2-2 (also serving<br>
as the UL scheduling request), the eNB 10 terminates the<br>
process (no route in step A34 in Fig. 16) .<br>
On the other hand, upon receipt of the response message<br>
#2-3 from the eNB 10 (step B34 in Fig. 17), the UE 20 creates<br>
a confirmation response (ACK/NACK) message #3 to the<br>
response message #2-3 in the access judging unit 25 and<br>
transmits the created message to the eNB 10. At that time,<br>
the UE 20 provides information (an identifier or a flag)<br>
indicating that "the message #3 also serves as an UL<br>
scheduling request" to the confirmation response message<br>
#3 in the identifier providing unit 26 and transmits the<br>
message to the eNB 10 (step 35 in Fig. 17). The provided<br>
information may be transmitted by a dedicated uplink me s sage<br>
alternatively to being transmitted concurrently with the<br>
confirmation response message #3.<br>
In other words, when executing random access through<br>
the use of a signature for obtaining (establishing) the<br>
uplink synchronization, the UE 20 additionally transmits<br>
the UL scheduling request to the eNB 10 when the random<br>
access terminates.<br>
As described above, according to the method of random<br>
access of the fourth embodiment, when uplink data is<br>
generated in a UE 20 after the eNB 10 generates downlink<br>
data destined for the UE 20 and responsively allocates a<br>
signature to the same UE 20, the UE 20 does not create a<br>
signature used for the contention based random access but<br>
does continue the non-contention based random access using<br>
the signature allocated by the eNB 10, which thereby brings<br>
the same effects and advantages as the third embodiment.<br>
In addition, since the confirmation response message<br>
#3 to the random access response message #2-3 also serves<br>
as an UL scheduling request, at least transmission of<br>
downlink data can be normally started even if the eNB 10<br>
cannot correctly receive or recognize the confirmation<br>
response message #3 due to the propagation environment.<br>
The uplink message also serving as an UL scheduling<br>
request may be, for example, one for reporting the CQI to<br>
the eNB 10.<br>
(5) fifth embodiment:<br>
Fig. 18 is a sequence diagram explaining a random access<br>
procedure of the fifth embodiment. This embodiment is an<br>
example of transmitting the signature allocation message<br>
(RA preamble Assignment) #2-1 after the transmission of<br>
Response message (Random Access Response) #1-2 to the UE<br>
20 from the eNB 10.<br>
In other words, the UE 20 generates uplink data, the<br>
UE 20 creates a random signature at the signature managing<br>
unit 24 and transmits a random access preamble message<br>
(uplink transmission request) #1-1 containing the created<br>
random signature to the eNB 10 (step S1a).<br>
Upon receipt of the message #1-1, the eNB 10 replay<br>
with the response message (Random Access Response) #1-2<br>
to the received uplink transmission request message #1-1<br>
(step S2) along with a timing advanced as synchronization<br>
signal for uplink communication, an uplink grant for<br>
transmission permission, and others. If a number of UEs<br>
20 concurrently transmit requests through the RACH, the<br>
eNB 10 returns the response message #1-2 to the UEs 20.<br>
At this stage, when downlink data which is destined<br>
for the UE 20 and which is from the upper apparatus arrives<br>
at the eNB 10, the eNB 10 creates a dedicated signature<br>
in the signature managing unit 15, and transmits the<br>
signature to the UE 20 via the signature allocation message<br>
(RA Preamble Assignment) #2-1 (step S2b).<br>
Upon receipt of the signature allocation message (RA<br>
Preamble Assignment) #2-1, multiple allocation occurs due<br>
to the presence both the random signature and the dedicated<br>
signature at the UE 20. When detecting the multiple<br>
allocation, the UE 20 selects one signature and continues<br>
the execution of the random access corresponding to the<br>
selected signature (Fig. 18 assumes the contention based<br>
random access is selected) in the same manner as the first<br>
and the second embodiments.<br>
In this case, the uplink message #1-3 that is to be<br>
transmitted in the later step S3 can also serve as UL<br>
synchronization confirmation the same as the first<br>
embodiment. Alternatively, the uplink message #1-3 can<br>
also serve as the UL scheduling request the same as the<br>
second embodiment. Further, the uplink message (Random<br>
Access Preamble) #2-2 can also serve as the UL scheduling<br>
request, which may be transmitted by means of an ACK/NACK<br>
signal responsive to the response message #2-3 or may be<br>
transmitted by means of a dedicated uplink message.<br>
Then, the eNB 10 confirms the effective ID of the UE<br>
20by, forexample, receiving the message # 1-3 and can release<br>
one of the signatures in the state of the multiple allocation.<br>
Namely, from the first and the fifth embodiment, the<br>
signature allocation message (RA Preamble Assignment) #2-1<br>
may be transmitted at any timing as long as before the eNB<br>
10 receives the message #1-3.<br>
(6) sixth embodiment:<br>
Fig . 19 is a sequence diagram explaining a random access<br>
procedure of the sixth embodiment. This embodiment is an<br>
example of transmitting the signature allocation message<br>
(RA preamble Assignment) #2-1 after the transmission of<br>
a message (Scheduled Transmission) #1-3 to the eNB 10 from<br>
the UE 20.<br>
Specifically, when the UE 20 generates uplink data,<br>
the UE 20 transmits the random access preamble message<br>
(uplink transmission request) #1-1 containing the random<br>
signature to the eNB 10 (step S1a), receives a response<br>
message #1-2 to this message (step S2), and transmits the<br>
message #1-3 (step S3).<br>
Upon receipt of the message #1-3, the eNB 10 starts<br>
the detection of the effective ID (terminal ID) of the UE<br>
20. Successful detection of the effective ID makes it<br>
possible to recognize that the contention of signatures<br>
occurs between which UEs 20. If a contention occurs, the<br>
eNB 10 transmits the contention resolution message<br>
(Contention Resolution) #1-4 to the UEs 20 in question to<br>
solve the contention (step S4) .<br>
Here, presuming that the eNB 10 could not recognize<br>
the message #1-3 due to the reason that during processing<br>
themessage #1-3, downlinkdata destined for the UE 20 arrives<br>
at the eNB 10 from the upper apparatus (the buffering unit<br>
13 stores downlink data) and therefore the receiving of<br>
the message #1-3 could not be completed.<br>
In this case, the eNB 10 causes the signature managing<br>
unit 15 to create and store a signature (dedicated signature:<br>
the second information) that is to be used for random access<br>
(UL synchronization request) by UE 20, and transmits the<br>
dedicated signature via the signature allocation message<br>
(RA preamble Assignment) #2-1 to the UE 20 through the<br>
transmitting/receiving unit 12 (step S3a).<br>
Upon completion of transmitting and receiving<br>
processing on these messages #1-3 and #2-1 the eNB 10 can<br>
recognize "which UE 20 uses which signature", that is, can<br>
recognize "two signatures (i.e., Random Preamble and<br>
Dedicated Preamble) are issued to which UE 20.<br>
Here, when the UE 20 and another UE (hereinafter called<br>
the second UE) do not establish contention, the UE 20 can<br>
be judged to have multiple allocation, so that the eNB 10<br>
(the signature managing unit 15) immediately releases the<br>
dedicated signature allocated to the UE 20, and normally<br>
transmits a Contention Resolution message #1-4 (step S4).<br>
At this time, the uplink synchronization can correctly<br>
secured, so that the transmission of downlink data can be<br>
started.<br>
Conversely, when the UE 20 and the second UE establish<br>
contention, there is a possibility of collision between<br>
messages #1-3 that the UE 20 and the second UE transmit.<br>
At this stage, the UE 20 cannot be judged to have multiple<br>
allocation, and the dedicated signature allocated to the<br>
UE 20 cannot be immediately released. In the event of<br>
contention, the eNB 10 notifies the UE 20 of the contention<br>
through the Contention Resolution message #1-4. This case<br>
preferably maintains the dedicated signature until an UE<br>
20 having multiple signatures is detected.<br>
In the meantime, regardless of whether or not the UE<br>
20 notifies the eNB 10 the terminal ID of the UE 20 itself<br>
to the eNB 10, the UE 20 can recognize (detect) the presence<br>
of both the random signature (Random Preamble) created in<br>
the UE 20 itself and the dedicated signature allocated by<br>
the eNB 10, thatis, occurrence of two kinds of random access,<br>
when the transmission of the message #1-3 and the signature<br>
allocation message #2-1 is completed.<br>
At that time, when the messages #1-3 transmitted from<br>
the UE 20 and the second UE do not collide with each other,<br>
the UE 20 grasps that no contention is established with<br>
reference to the Contention Resolution message #1-4<br>
notified from the eNB 10. Consequently, the UE 20, for<br>
example, releases the dedicated preamble, and maintains<br>
UL synchronization in the contention based random access<br>
procedure because the UE 20 correctly receives UL timing<br>
information via the message #1-2.<br>
Conversely, when the messages #1-3 transmitted from<br>
the UE 20 and the second UE collide with each other, the<br>
UE 20 grasps that contention is established with reference<br>
to the Contention Resolution message #1-4 notified from<br>
the eNB 10. Consequently, the UE 20 releases the dedicated<br>
preamble and can concurrently perform both the UL<br>
synchronization request and the UL scheduling request in<br>
the contention based random access the same as the first<br>
embodiment. Alternatively, the UE 20 can perform both the<br>
UL synchronization request and the UL scheduling request<br>
in the non-contention based random access the same as the<br>
second through the fourth embodiments.<br>
Further, as described in the first embodiment, both<br>
random access procedures can be concurrently proceed. In<br>
other words, upon detection that the contention is<br>
established, the non-contention based random access can<br>
also be carried out at the same time through the use of<br>
the dedicated signature notified in the message #2-1.<br>
The sixth embodiment describes the case where the<br>
message #2-1 is transmitted during themessage #1-3 is being<br>
processed. Needless to say, this embodiment results the<br>
same if the message #2-1 is transmitted between the messages<br>
#1-2 and #1-3.<br>
