				<td>PROCESS FOR PREPARING R-GOSSYPOL L-PHENYLALANINOL<br>
DEENAMINE<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
[0001]            This   invention  relates   to   a  process   for  preparing  R-gossypol<br>
L-phenylalaninol dienamine using non-chromatographic purification methods.<br>
In particular, the invention is directed to resolution of R- and S-gossypol<br>
L-phenylalaninol dienamine by crystallization. R-gossypol L-phenylalaninol<br>
dienamine is a useful intermediate for the preparation of R-(-)-gossypol and<br>
R-(-)-gossypol acetic acid co-crystals. R-(-&gt;Gossypol acetic acid and its<br>
co-crystals are useful for inducing apoptosis in cells and for sensitizing cells to<br>
the induction of apoptotic cell death.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
[0002]            US 2005/0234135 Al discloses R-(-)-gossypol in the form of acetic<br>
acid co-crystals and its use as an inhibitor anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins.<br>
By inhibiting anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins, R-(-)-gossypol sensitizes<br>
cells to inducers of apoptosis and, in some instances, itself induces apoptosis.<br>
Because of the potential utility of R-(-)-gossypol and its acetic acid co-crystal<br>
in the treatment of cancer and other diseases, there exists a need to develop a<br>
practical synthetic route to produce substantial quantities of this drug<br>
substance.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0003]            The invention confronts the problem of providing a process for<br>
obtaining R-(-)-gossypol and its acetic acid co-crystal with high purity.<br>
[0004]            The invention is based on the unexpected discovery that R-gossypol L-<br>
phenylalaninol dienamine can be isolated in high diastereomeric purity from a<br>
a solvent system comprising acetonitrile and water. This obviates the need for<br>
chromatographic resolution and is more amenable to large-scale production of<br>
R-gossypol L-phenylalaninol diimine and, ultimately, R-(-)-gossypol and its<br>
acetic acid co-crystal.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0005]            The present invention relates to a process for preparing R-gossypol<br>
L-phenylalaninol dienamine using non-chromatographic purification methods.<br>
In particular, the invention is directed to resolution of R- and S-gossypol<br>
L-phenylalaninol dienamine by crystallization in a solvent system comprising<br>
acetonitrile and water.<br>
[0006]            Applicants have found that crystallization of a mixture of R- and<br>
S-gossypol Schiff bases, and tautomers thereof, to provide the R-isomer<br>
substantially free from the S-isomer was challenging and unpredictable. To<br>
this end, an assortment of solvent systems were surveyed in an effort to<br>
identify one useful for resolving R- and S-gossypol L-phenylalanine diimine.<br>
These studies did not succeed in identifying conditions suitable to produce R-<br>
gossypol L-phenylalanine diimine substantially free from S-gossypol L-<br>
phenylalanine      diimine.             Solvent      systems       such      as       1:2<br>
dichloromethane:isopropyl alcohol, 1:1 dichloromethane:isopropyl alcohol,<br>
1:2 dichloromethane:methanol, 1:5:1.5 dichloromethane:hexane:heptane, 2:1<br>
methanolrhexane, 2:1 ethanokhexane, toluene, 1:1 toluene:heptane,<br>
acetonitrile, 10:1 acetonitrile: water, tert-butyl methyl ether and tert-butyl<br>
methyl ether:heptane led to modest diastereomeric enrichment in favor of<br>
R-gossypol L-phenylalanine diimine. Solvent systems such as 1:2<br>
dichl oromethane.ethanol and 2:1 methanol:water led to no diastereomeric<br>
enrichment.           Crystal     formation     was     not     observed     in     2:1<br>
dichloromethane:isopropyl alcohol and 2:1 water.tetrahydrofuran. Three<br>
successive   crystallizations   in   1:2   dichloromethane:isopropanol   did   not<br>
significantly improve the diastercomeric ratio. These data are presented in<br>
Example 2.<br>
[0007]            Experiments aimed at resolving R- and S-gossypol L-phenylalaninol<br>
dienaminc were also investigated. Crystallization attempts in solvent systems<br>
such as methyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, acetone, toluene, acetonitrile, 1:1<br>
toluenetheptane, 2:1 tert-butyl methyl etherheptane, 2:1 methanol:hexane, 1:1<br>
dichloromethane:hexane, 5:1 tetrahydroftiran:water and 1:1 methanol:water<br>
resulted in either no enrichment in diastereomeric purity or no crystal<br>
formation. In contrast, crystallization in 5:1 acetonitrile.water resulted in a<br>
striking improvement in diastereomeric purity favoring R-gossypol L-<br>
phenylalaninol dienamine. This unexpected finding was refined to produce a<br>
novel, reproducible process for the preparation R-gossypol L-phenylalaninol<br>
dienamine. These data are presented in Examples 4 to 8.<br>
(0008]            In   one   embodiment,   R-gossypol   L-phenylalaninol   dienamine   is<br>
prepared from a mixture of R- and S-gossypol L-phenylalaninol dienamine via<br>
a process comprising crystallizing said mixture from a solvent system<br>
comprising acetonitrile and water and isolating crystalline R-gossypol L-<br>
phenylalaninol dienamine substantially free from said S-gossypol L-<br>
phenylalaninol dienamine. In one embodiment, crystalline R-gossypol L-<br>
phenylalaninol dienamine is isolated by filtration. In another embodiment,<br>
crystalline R-gossypol L-phenylalaninol dienamine is isolated by<br>
centrifugation.<br>
[0009]            In one embodiment, the solvent system used to crystallize R-gossypol<br>
L-phenylalaninol dienamine substantially free from S-gossypol L-<br>
phenylalaninol dienamine, comprises acetonitrile and water in a ratio of about<br>
10:1 to about 5:2. In another embodiment, the solvent system used to<br>
crystallize R-gossypol L-phenylalaninol dienamine substantially free from S-<br>
gossypol L-phenylalaninol dienamine, comprises acetonitrile and water in a<br>
ratio of about 5:1. In another embodiment, the solvent system used to<br>
crystallize R-gossypol L-phenylalaninol dienamine substantially free from S-<br>
gossypol L-phenylalaninol dienamine, comprises acetonitrile and water in a<br>

crystallize R-gossypol L-phenylalaninol dienamine substantially free from S-<br>
gossypol L-phenylalaninol dienamine, comprises acetonitrile and water in a<br>
ratio of about 5:2. In a further embodiment, the solvent system used to<br>
crystallize R-gossypol L-phenylalaninol dienamine substantially free from S-<br>
gossypol L-phenylalaninol dienamine comprises acetonitrile and water in a<br>
ratio of 5:1.<br>
[0010]            In   one   embodiment,   crystalline   R-gossypol    L-phenylalaninol<br>
dienamine is recrystallized one or more times until the desired level of purity<br>
is achieved. In a further embodiment, crystalline R-gossypol L-phenylalaninol<br>
dienamine is recrystallized in a solvent system comprising acetonitrile and<br>
water.<br>
[0011]            In one embodiment, isolated crystalline R-gossypol L-phenylalaninol<br>
dienamine is washed one or more times with a solvent system comprising<br>
acetonitrile and water. In one embodiment, isolated crystalline R-gossypol<br>
L-phenylalaninol dienamine is washed with a solvent system comprising<br>
acetonitrile and water in a ratio of about 10:1 to about 5:2. In a further<br>
embodiment, isolated crystalline R-gossypol L-phenylalaninol dienamine is<br>
washed with a solvent system comprising acetonitrile and water in a ratio of<br>
about 5:1. In a further embodiment, isolated crystalline R-gossypol<br>
L-phenylalaninol dienamine is washed with a solvent system comprising<br>
acetonitrile and water in a ratio of 5:1. In a further embodiment, the<br>
crystalline R-gossypol L-phenylalaninol dienamine is dried in vacuo.<br>
[0012]            In  one embodiment, the crystalline R-gossypol  L-phenylalaninol<br>
dienamine has a purity of about 89%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%,<br>
97% 98%, 99% or 99.5%.<br>
[0013]             In    one    embodiment,    crystalline    R-gossypol    L-phenylalaninol<br>
dienamine comprises about 11%, 10%, 9%, 8%, 7%, 6%, 5%, 4%, 3%, 2%,<br>
1% or 0.5% S-gossypol L-phenylalaninol dienamine or less.<br>
[0014]            In   one   embodiment  R-gossypol   L-phenylalaninol   dienamine   is<br>
prepared by a) condensing gossypol with L-phenylalaninol in acetonitrile to<br>
provide a mixture of R- and S-gossypol L-phenylalaninol dienaraine; b)<br>
adding water the reaction mixture at the completion of the reaction between<br>
gossypol and L-phenylalaninol to obtain crystalline R-gossypol L-<br>
phenylalaninol dienamine; and c) isolating the crystalline R-gossypol L-<br>
phenylalaninol dienamine substantially free from the S-gossypol L-<br>
phenylalaninol dienamine. In a further embodiment, the reaction mixture is<br>
heated to about 50°C prior to the addition of water. In a further embodiment,<br>
the reaction mixture is cooled to about 5°C after the addition of water. In a<br>
further embodiment, crystalline R-gossypol L-phenylalaninol dienamine is<br>
isolated by filtration or centrifugation<br>
[0015]            The  term   "gossypol,"   as  used  herein,  refers  to  a  composition<br>
comprising the compound of the structure:<br>
<br>
or a tautomer thereof.<br>
[0016]            Gossypol may be obtained from any one of a number of sources such<br>
as the cotton plant, e.g., from cottonseeds or other plant parts. Species of<br>
cotton vary widely both in the total content of gossypol and the optical activity<br>
of the gossypol. While many species of cotton contain gossypol that is about<br>
50% R-gossypol and 50% S-gossypol, several species have been identified<br>
that contain either high levels of (S)-gossypol {e.g., Gossypium hirsutum, G.<br>
arboreum, G. mustelinum, G. anomalum, G. gossypioides, G. capatis-viridis,<br>
(up to about 97% (S)-gossypol)) or high levels of (R)-gossypol (e.g., G.<br>
barbadense, G. darwinii, G. sturtianjm, G. areysianum, G. longicalyx, G<br>
harknessii, G. costulatum (up to about 65% (R)-gossypol)). See, e.g., Hua et<br>
al, Contraception 57:239 (1988); Cass et al, J. Agric. Food Chem. J2:5822<br>
(2004); Stipanovic et al, J. Agric. Food Chem. 55:6266 (2005); Stipanovic et<br>
al, 2005 Beltwide Cotton Conferences, New Orleans, Louisiana, January 4-7,<br>
2005, p. 900. The enantiomeric ratio of gossypol also varies in different parts<br>
of the cotton plant. For example, in G. barbadense the seeds typically have an<br>
excess of (R)-gossypol, but the roots and flowers may contain an excess of<br>
(S)-gossypol (Cass et ai, J. Agric. Food Chem. 52:5822 (2004)). Thus, a<br>
strain of cotton or a part thereof that is high in (R)-gossypol may be<br>
advantageously used as the source of the gossypol for the present invention.<br>
[0017]            In one embodiment, gossypol is approximately racemic, i.e., it contains<br>
about 50% R-gossypol and about 50% S-gossypol. In another embodiment,<br>
gossypol is enriched in R-gossypol. In another embodiment, gossypol is<br>
enriched in S-gossypol.<br>
[0018]            The term "R-gossypol" or "R-(-)-gossypol," as used herein, refers to a<br>
composition comprising the compound of structure:<br>
<br>
^or a tautomer thereof.<br>
[0020]            The term "gossypol acetic acid," as used herein, refers to a composition<br>
comprising gossypol and acetic acid in the form of co-crystals.<br>
[0021]            In one embodiment, crystallization of R-gossypol L-phenylalaninol<br>
dienamine from a mixture of R- and S-gossypol L-phenylalaninol dienamine is<br>
induced by seeding with crystalline R-gossypol L-phenylalaninol dienamine.<br>
In a further embodiment, the reaction mixture is cooled to about 5°C or less to<br>
facilitate crystallization.<br>
[0022]             In   one   embodiment,   crystalline   R-gossypol   L-phenylalaninol<br>
dienamine is hydrolyzed to provide crude R-gossypol or R-gossypol acetic<br>
acid co-crystal. In a further embodiment, the hydrolysis of R-gossypol L-<br>
phcnylalaninol dienamine is carried out at about 52°C. In a further<br>
embodiment, the hydrolysis of R-gossypol L-phenylalaninol dienamine is<br>
carried out in the absence of tetrahydrofuran. In a further embodiment, the<br>
hydrolysis of R-gossypol L-phenylalaninol dienamine is carried out in the<br>
presence of acetic acid, hydrochloric acid and water.<br>
[0023]             In one embodiment, R-gossypol or R-gossypol acetic acid co-crystals<br>
are isolated by filtration or centrifugation. In a further embodiment, R-<br>
gossypol or R-gossypol acetic acid co-crystals are washed with a solvent<br>
system comprising acetic acid and water. In a further embodiment, R-<br>
gossypol or R-gossypol acetic acid co-crystals are washed with water. In a<br>
further embodiment, R-gossypol or R-gossypol acetic acid co-crystals are<br>
dried in vacuo.<br>
[0024]            In one embodiment, R-gossypol acetic acid co-crystals are purified via<br>
crystallization in one or more solvent systems until the desired level of purity<br>
is achieved. In a further embodiment, R-gossypol acetic acid co-crystals are<br>
isolated by filtration or centrifugation. In a further embodiment, R-gossypol<br>
acetic acid co-crystals are washed with a solvent mixture. In a further<br>
embodiment, R-gossypol acetic acid co-crystals are dried in vacuo.<br>
[0025]            In one embodiment, crystallization of R-gossypol acetic acid co-<br>
crystals is carried out in a solvent system comprising ethyl acetate, ethanol,<br>
acetic acid and water. In a further embodiment, R-gossypol acetic acid co-<br>
crystals are washed with a solvent system comprising ethyl acetate, ethanol,<br>
acetic acid and water. In a further embodiment, R-gossypol acetic acid co-<br>
crystals are dried in vacuo.<br>
[0026]            In one embodiment, crystallization of R-gossypol acetic acid co-<br>
crystals is carried out in a solvent system comprising acetone, acetic acid and<br>
water.<br>
[0027]            In one embodiment, crystallization of R-gossypol acetic acid co-<br>
crystals is carried out in a solvent system comprising acetic acid and water. In<br>
a further embodiment, R-gossypol acetic acid co-crystals are washed with a<br>
solvent system comprising acetic and water. In a further embodiment, R-<br>
gossypol acetic acid co-crystals are dried in vacuo.<br>
[0028]            In one embodiment, R-gossypol acetic acid co-crystal is recrystallized<br>
one or more times in one or more solvent systems until the desired level of<br>
purity is achieved<br>
[0029]            In one embodiment, a process for preparing R-(-)-gossypol acetic acid<br>
co-crystals is provided, the improvement comprising crystallizing a mixture of<br>
R- and S-gossypol L-phenylalaninol dienamine from a solvent system<br>
comprising acetonitrile and water and isolating crystalline R-gossypol L-<br>
phenylalaninol dienamine substantially free from said S-gossypol L-<br>
phenylalaninol dienamine; and preparing the R-(-)-gossypol acetic acid co-<br>
crystals.<br>
[0030]            In one embodiment, a process for preparing R-(-)-gossypol acetic acid<br>
co-crystals is provided, the improvement comprising: a) condensing gossypol<br>
with L-phenylalaninol in acetonitrile to provide a mixture of R- and S-<br>
gossypol L-phenylalaninol dienamine; b) adding water the reaction mixture at<br>
the completion of a) to obtain crystallized R-gossypol L-phenylalaninol<br>
dienamine; and c) isolating said crystalline R-gossypol L-phenylalaninol<br>
dienamine substantially free from said S-gossypol L-phenylalaninol<br>
dienamine; and preparing the R-(-)-gossypol acetic acid co-crystals.<br>
[0031]            The term "about," as used herein, includes the recited number ± 10%.<br>
Thus, "about 10" means 9 to 11.<br>
[0032]            The  term   "purity,"   as  used   herein,   refers  to  chemical   and/or<br>
stereoisomeric (i.e., diastereomeric or enantiomeric) purity, unless otherwise<br>
indicated. The term "enantiomeric purity," as used herein, refers to a measure<br>
of the enantiomeric excess or ee of a chiral substance. The term "enantiomeric<br>
excess" or "ee" refers to a measure for how much of one enantiomer is present<br>
compared to the other. For a mixture of R and S enantiomers, the percent<br>
enantiomeric excess is defined as | R - S | *100, where R and S are the<br>
respective mole or weight fractions of enantiomers in a mixture such that R +<br>
S = 1. With knowledge of the optical rotation of a chiral substance, the<br>
percent enantiomeric excess is defined as ([a]obj/[oOmax)*100, where [ot]0b, is<br>
the optical rotation of the mixture of enantiomers and [<x is the optical></x>
rotation of the pure enantiomer. The term "diastereomeric purity," as used<br>
herein, is defined by analogy to enantiomeric purity. Determination of<br>
diastereomeric or enantiomeric excess is possible using a variety of analytical<br>
techniques, including NMR spectroscopy, chiral column chromatography or<br>
optical polarimetry.<br>
[0033]            In one embodiment, R-(-)-gossypol acetic acid co-crystals have a<br>
purity of about 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or 99.5% or more.<br>
[0034]            The term "substantially free," as used herein, refers to a composition<br>
comprising at least about 89% by weight of one stereoisomer (i.e., enantiomer<br>
or diastereomer) over the corresponding stereoisomer. In another<br>
embodiment, the composition comprises at least about 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%,<br>
99% or 99.5% by weight of the preferred stereoisomer. Thus, the term "R-<br>
gossypol L-phenylalaninol dienamine substantially free from S-gossypol L-<br>
phenylalaninol dienamine," as used herein, refers to a composition of R-<br>
gossypol L-phenylalaninol dienamine comprising at least about 89% of R-<br>
gossypol L-phenylalaninol dienamine and at most about 11% of S-gossypol L-<br>
phenylalaninol dienamine by weight.<br>
[0035]            In one embodiment, R-(-)-gossypol acetic acid co-crystal comprises<br>
about 5%, 4%, 3%, 2%, 1% or 0.5% or less of (S)-(+)-gossypol.<br>
[0036]            The term "seeding," as used herein, refers to adding a small amount of<br>

or a dienamine tautomer thereof.<br>
[0039]            The term "dienamine tautomer," as used herein, refers to all tautomcric<br>
forms of the condensation products between L-phenylalaninol and gossypol<br>
including, but not limited to, the bis oxazolidine tautomer 1, diimine (i.e.,<br>

[0040]            In one embodiment, the invention provides a composition consisting<br>
essentially of co-crystals of R-(-)-gossypol and acetic acid in a molar ratio of<br>
about 1:1 with a purity of about 95% or more. In another embodiment, the<br>

[0042]            L-Phenylalanine methyl ester hydrochloride (4.9 g) was dissolved in<br>
water (25 mL) in a 100 mL round bottom flask and stirred at room<br>
temperature. Sodium carbonate (3.1 g) in water (12.5 mL) was added in 3<br>
minutes. The reaction mixture was stirred for 5 minutes at room temperature.<br>
Dichloromethane (25 mL) was added and the reaction mixture was stirred 5<br>
minutes. The aqueous solution was transferred to a 125 mL separating runnel.<br>
The organic layer was collected. The aqueous layer was extracted twice with<br>
12.5 mL of dichloromethane. The three organic extractions were combined,<br>
dried with magnesium sulfate (6g), filtered to remove the magnesium sulfate<br>
and concentrated to give L-phenylalanine methyl ester free base.<br>
Step 2<br>
[0043]            In a 250 mL flask equipped with a thermometer and under nitrogen,<br>
racemic gossypol acetic acid (5g) was suspended in dichloromethane (50 mL).<br>
The free base of L-phenylalanine methyl ester from step 1 in dichloromethane<br>
was added to the racemic gossypol acetic acid suspension over the course of 5<br>
minutes. The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 15 minutes<br>
and magnesium sulfate (8.2 g) was added. Stirring was continued an<br>
additional 17 h. The reaction mixture was filtered to remove magnesium<br>
sulfate, concentrated and dried to give a diastereomeric mixture of R- and S-<br>
gossypol L-phenylalanine diimine.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
Crystallization study of R- and S-gossypol L-phenylalanine diimine<br>
[0044]            General protocol: In a 25 mL (one neck) round bottom flask, 0.2 to 0.6<br>
g of a diastereomeric mixture of R- and S-gossypol L-phenylalanine diimine<br>
was introduced under nitrogen atmosphere. Then, 1 mL of solvent was added<br>
and the reaction mixture was heated at 50°C. The appropriate amount of<br>
solvent was introduced to obtain a limpid solution. After two hours at room<br>
temperature, a yellow precipitate that formed was filtered and the crystalline<br>
product was analyzed by HPLC. Results are presented in Table 1. For<br>
brevity, "R" denotes R-gossypol L-phenylalanine diimine and "S" denotes<br>
S-gossypol L-phenylalanine diimine. DCM = dichloromethane; iPrOH =<br>
isopropanol; MeOH = methanol; THF = tetrahydrofuran; TBME = /err-butyl<br>
methyl ether; MeCN = acetonitrile.<br>
(0046]            Racemic   gossypol   acetic   acid   (0.276   g)   was   treated   with<br>
dichloromethane (1.05 mL) followed by L-phenylalaninol (0.1515 g) and<br>
allowed to stir at 25°C for 17 h. The reaction mixture was dried with<br>
magnesium sulfate, filtered and concentrated to dryness to give 0.352 g of R-<br>
and S-gossypol-L-phenyalaninol dienamine as a brown solid.<br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
Crystallization study of R- and S-gossypol phenylalaninol dienamine<br>
(0047]            General protocol: In a 25 mL (one neck) round bottom flask, 0.2 to 1.1<br>
g of a diastereomeric mixture of R- and S-gossypol L-phenylalaninol<br>
dienamine was introduced under nitrogen atmosphere. Then, 1 mL of solvent<br>
was added and the reaction mixture was heated at 50°C. The appropriate<br>
[0048]            Thus, a solvent system comprising acetonitrile and water provided R-<br>
gossypol L-phenylalaninol dienamine substantially free from S-gossypol L-<br>
phenylalaninol dienamine with an R:S ratio of about 89:11. Other solvent<br>
systems resulted in no enrichment of diastereomeric purity or no crystal<br>
formation.<br>
EXAMPLE 5<br>
Crystallization studies in acetonitrile:water mixtures<br>
[0049]            General protocol:    Referring to Table 4, a mixture of R- and S-<br>
gossypol L-phenylalaninol dienamine (gossypol dienamine; amount) was<br>
solublized in acetonitrile at 21°C - 25°C and water was added drop wise over<br>
the period of time indicated in a) to achieve the desired acetonitrile:water<br>
ratio. R-gossypol L-phenylalaninol dienamine crystallized and was filtered<br>
through a sintered runnel after the period of time and temperature indicated in<br>
b). The isolated crystalline R-gossypol L-phenylalaninol dienamine was<br>
washed with the same ratio of solvent used for crystallization as indicated in c)<br>
and dried in vacua.<br>
[0052]            Thus, a one pot synthesis/crystallization protocol provided an effective<br>
means of isolating R-gossypol L-phenylalaninol dienamine substantially free<br>
from S-gossypol L-phenylalaninol dienamine. Starting from about 80 g of<br>
gossypol acetic acid, R-gossypol L-phenylalaninol dienamine was obtained in<br>
83% yield and 99.2% purity.<br>
EXAMPLE 7<br>
Reproducibility of R-gossypol phenylalaninol dienamine crystallization<br>
[0053]            General protocol:   Referring to Table 6, racemic gossypol acetic acid<br>
(amount) and L-phenylalaninol (2.1 equiv.) were combined in acetonitrile at<br>
30°C and stirred for the indicated period of time. In each experiment the<br>
acetonitrilerwater ratio was about 5:1 and seeding was with crystalline<br>
R-gossypol L-phenylalaninol dienamine at the temperature indicated. The<br>
isolated crystalline R-gossypol L-phenylalaninol dienamine was washed with<br>
about 5:1 acetonitrile:water. Purities are determined by HPLC.<br>
[0054]            Thus, crystallization of R-gossypol L-phenylalaninol dienamine from a<br>
solvent system comprising about 5:1 acetonitrile:water was reproducible when<br>
seeded with pure R-gossypol L-phenylalaninol dienamine. In each case, good<br>
diastereomeric and chemical purity was obtained.<br>
EXAMPLE 8<br>
Large-scale preparation of R-gossypol-L-phenyalaninol dienamine<br>
[0055]             Racemic gossypol acetic acid (152.8g, 1.0 eq) and L-phenylalaninol<br>
(83.9 g, 2.1 eq.) were dissolved in acetonitrile (1039 mL) and heated at 30°C<br>
for 2.5 h under nitrogen. The mixture was then heated to 50°C and water (208<br>
mL, 1.4 eq. w/w) was added. The solution was cooled to 37°C and seeded with<br>
pure R-gossypol-L-phenyalaninol (0.518 g, 0.5% w/w). The mixture was<br>
cooled to 5°C. The suspension was filtered, washed with acetonitrile:water<br>
(5:1,208 mL) at 5°C and dried in vacuo at 30°C to give crystalline R-gossypol<br>
L-phenyalaninol dienamine as a brownish orange solid (90.5 g, 87%). HPLC<br>
analysis indicated a diastereomeric R.S ratio of 98.5.1.5.<br>
[0056]            If  further   purification   is   desired,   R-gossypol   L-phenyalaninol<br>
dienamine (59.0 g) obtained according to the method of Example 8 (above) is<br>
solublized in 5:1 acetonitrile:water (563 mL) at 60°C. The solution is cooled to<br>
47°C, seeded with pure R-gossypol-L-phenyalaninol (0.087 g) and cooled to<br>
5°C. The resulting suspension is filtered, washed twice with 5:1<br>
acetonitrile:water (94 mL) at 5°C and dried in vacuo at 30°C to give crystalline<br>
R-gossypol-L-phenyalaninol dienamine as a brownish orange solid (34.1 g,<br>
73%). HPLC analysis indicated a purity of 99.2%.<br>
[0058]            R-gossypol L-phenylalaninol dienamine (100 g, 1.0 eq.) was dissolved<br>
in glacial acetic acid (850 mL) at 52°C. Water (212.5 mL, 2.1 eq. w/w) was<br>
added followed by concentrated HC1 (41.0 mL, 8 eq.). Once the mixture was<br>
stirred at 52°C for 3.5 h, water (425 mL, 4.2 eq. w/w) was added slowly to the<br>
mixture. The suspension was cooled to 20°C, filtered, washed with acetic<br>
acid:water (1:1, 100 mL) and with water (100 mL), and dried in vacuo at 20°C<br>
to give R-gossypol acetic acid co-crystals as a yellow solid (104.7 g). HPLC<br>
purity is 97.23%.<br>
(0059]            R-gossypol acetic acid co-crystals (73.71 g, 1.0 eq) were dissolved in<br>
ethyl acetate (287 mL) and ethanol (59 mL) at 20°C. The solution was filtered<br>
and rinsed with ethyl acetate (96 mL), acetic acid (260 mL) and water (64<br>
mL). The solution was concentrated in vacuo below 30°C to remove at least<br>
80% of the total volume of ethyl acetate and ethanol. Acetic acid:water (1:1,<br>
147 mL) was added and the suspension was stirred at 20°C for 30 minutes,<br>
filtered and washed three times with acetic acid:water (1:1, 74 mL). R-<br>
gossypol acetic acid co-crystals were obtained as a yellow solid (179.4 g) and<br>
used directly in the next step.<br>
[0060]            If further purification is desired, R-gossypol acetic acid co-crystals<br>
(73.71 g) obtained from the method of Example 9, step 2 (above), ethyl acetate<br>
(383 mL), ethanol (59 mL) and acetic acid (260 mL) are stirred at 20°C.<br>
Water (64 mL) is added and the suspension is concentrated in vacuo below<br>
30°C to remove at least 80% of the total volume of ethyl acetate and ethanol.<br>
Acetic acid:water (1:1, 147 mL) is added and the suspension is stirred at 20°C<br>
for 30 minutes, filtered and washed with acetic acid:water (1:1, 74 mL) at<br>
20°C. R-gossypol acetic acid co-crystals are obtained as a yellow solid (119.1<br>
g)-<br>
(0061]            If further purification is desired, additional crystallizations can be<br>
performed.<br>
Step 3 - Solvent exchange<br>
[0062]            R-(-)-gossypol  acetic acid  co-crystals  (73.71   g,   1.0  eq.)  were<br>
suspended in acetone (590 mL), treated with acetic acid (295 mL) and stirred<br>
at 20°C. Water (295 mL) was added and the solution was concentrated in<br>
vacuo at 80% of the volume of acetone. The suspension<br>
was stirred at 20°C, filtered and washed with acetic acid:watcr (1:1, 100 mL).<br>
R-gossypol acetic acid co-crystals were obtained as a yellow solid (80.0 g) and<br>
used directly in the next step.<br>
EXAMPLE 10<br>
Preparation of R-gossypol acetic acid co-crystal<br>
Scheme 5<br>
<br>
[0063]            R-gossypol acetic acid co-crystals (73.71 g, 1.0 eq.) were partially<br>
dissolved in acetic acid (295 mL) and stirred at 20°C for 3 h at which time<br>
water (295 mL) was added. The resulting suspension was filtered and washed<br>
with acetic acidrwater (1:1,100 mL). The isolated material was dried in vacuo<br>
at 20°C to give R-gossypol acetic acid co-crystals as a yellow solid (54.2 g,<br>
73% yield, 98.82% purity).<br>
(0064]            If further purification is desired, additional crystallizations can be<br>
performed.<br>
[0065]            The aforementioned Examples demonstrate the difficulty encountered<br>
in developing a process for obtaining R-(-)-gossypol and its acetic acid co-<br>
crystal. Two different diastereomeric gossypol derivatives were prepared in<br>
an effort to separate by crystallization the two diastereomers. As illustrated in<br>
Example 2, attempts to resolve a mixture of R- and S-gossypol L-<br>
phenylalanine diimine by crystallization were not successful. In this study, a<br>
variety of solvent systems were tested. Modest diastereomeric enrichment<br>
was observed in some cases.<br>
[0066]            As illustrated in Example 4, it was unexpectedly discovered that R-<br>
gossypol L-phenylalaninol dienamine could be isolated in high diastereomeric<br>
purity from a mixture of R- and S-gossypol L-phenylalaninol dienamine via<br>
crystallization in a solvent system comprising acetonitrile and water. All other<br>
solvent systems yielded unsatisfactory results. Most solvent systems resulted<br>
in no crystal formation. Based on this discovery, a reproducible one-pot<br>
process to isolate crystalline R-gossypol L-phenylalaninol dienamine was<br>
developed (Examples 5 to 7). This facilitated the large-scale preparation of R-<br>
(-)-gossypol acetic acid co-crystals as demonstrated in Examples 8 to 10.<br>
