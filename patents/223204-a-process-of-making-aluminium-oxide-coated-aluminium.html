				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a process of making aluminium oxide coated<br>
aluminium. The present invention particularly relates to a process for providing<br>
aluminium oxide coating on aluminium and aluminium alloy objects and<br>
components.<br>
Aluminium and aluminium alloys are widely used as components in automotive,<br>
marine, aerospace, electrical, construction industries and other engineering fields<br>
because they are inexpensive and have high specific strength and low densities.<br>
8ut aluminium is soft and chemically active. Most of its applications involve wear,<br>
corrosion, oxidation or thermal degradation. Aluminium components which are<br>
widely used in aerospace, automotive, marine, electrical and construction<br>
industries are subjected to corrosion, oxidation, electrical or thermal resistance<br>
and as such the characteristics of the aluminium components need to be<br>
improved. These improvements can be brought about by using aluminium oxide<br>
coating. Therefore, the process of the present invention for making aluminium<br>
oxide coated aluminium will find wide industrial utility.<br>
One simple way to protect the surface of the metal is to coat the metal with a<br>
suitable ceramic coating. Oxide coating specially aluminium oxide coating<br>
provides high oxidation, corrosion, wear and thermal resistance to metal. There<br>
are many existing techniques such as thermal spraying, sol-gel and vapor<br>
deposition, which are well practiced for forming ceramic coating on metal. But<br>
these are complicated and cost-ineffective.<br>
Anodizing is a well-known technology to develop protective oxide coating on<br>
aluminium and aluminium alloys. Reference may be made to United States<br>
Patents No. 6,258,463, Corridan; Michael Kevin, in Anodized cryogenically<br>
treated aluminium, wherein aluminium and aluminium alloy surfaces have been<br>
coated with oxide coatings by cryogenically treating the aluminium and thereafter<br>
anodizing. The drawback of this process is that maximum coating thickness is<br>
limited to 500 |jm. Also, cryogenic treatment makes this process cost-ineffective.<br>
Micro-arc can be used for the formation of oxide coating on aluminium.<br>
Reference may be made to United States Patent No. 6,197,178, Patel; Jerry L;<br>
Saka; Nannaji, in Method for forming ceramic coatings by micro-arc oxidation of<br>
reactive metals, wherein oxide coatings have been formed on aluminium and<br>
aluminium alloys by micro-arc oxidation. In this method, at least two aluminium<br>
metal bodies are suspended in an electrolytic bath. The metal bodies are<br>
connected to electrodes connected to a multiphase AC circuit. A multiphase<br>
power potential is imposed between the bodies. When bodies are moved into<br>
correct positions relative to each other, micro-arcs occur on the surfaces of the<br>
bodies. These electrical discharges cause oxidation of the bodies. Consequently,<br>
an oxide coating develops. The drawbacks are that it is complicated and requires<br>
precision control.<br>
Another reference may be made to United States Patent No. 4,938,993, Bennett;<br>
Michael J., in Protective coatings for alloys, wherein a protective surface coating<br>
of alumina has been formed on aluminium containing alloy. In this method, the<br>
alloy is coated with amorphous silica via plasma assisted vapor deposition and<br>
subsequently heat-treated in such conditions that a coherent, protective alumina<br>
coating can form. The drawbacks of the referred method are that it is complicated<br>
and costly. Moreover, this process provides a coating substantially of alumina.<br>
From the above referred prior art it is clear that there is a definite need for<br>
development of a process of making aluminium oxide coated aluminium.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a process of making<br>
aluminium oxide coated aluminium, which obviates the drawbacks as detailed<br>
above.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a simpler process of making<br>
aluminium oxide coated aluminium.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to provide a cost-effective process<br>
for the development of aluminium oxide coating on aluminium.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide enhanced coating<br>
thickness enabling a thick aluminium oxide coating on aluminium for improved<br>
characteristics.<br>
A further object of the present invention is to provide a process of tailoring the<br>
thickness of aluminium oxide coating for specific applications.<br>
In the present invention there is provided a process of making aluminium oxide<br>
coated aluminium wherein a partially oxidized aluminium sample is microwaved,<br>
causing the oxide layer thickness to increase with the increase in microwaving<br>
time. In this way, a thick oxide coating can be developed on aluminium which has<br>
various potential applications such as in automotive, aerospace, marine,<br>
electrical and construction industries wherein corrosion, oxidation, electrical or<br>
thermal resistance of the aluminium components need to be improved. The<br>
novelty of the process of the present invention lies in the fact that aluminium<br>
oxide coating thickness can be easily tailored for specific applications by minor<br>
adjustments of the processing parameters within the specified ranges. In addition<br>
to this, the method is advantageous in terms of simplicity, cost-effectiveness and<br>
varied coating microstructure.<br>
An oxide coating can be developed on aluminium by known method such as<br>
heating in a conventional air furnace. Beyond a critical time of heating coating<br>
thickness becomes almost standstill. No f r heating can increase the coating<br>
thickness notably. So, thicker coating cannot be generated by normal heating<br>
method in spite of heating for many hours. But when a partially oxidized<br>
aluminium sample is microwaved, as in the process of the present invention,<br>
oxide layer increases with the increase in microwaving time. In this way, a thick<br>
oxide coating can be developed on aluminium, thereby providing improved<br>
characteristics and making the material suitable for potential applications such as<br>
in automotive, aerospace, marine, electrical and construction industries.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a process of making aluminium oxide<br>
coated aluminium which comprises polishing aluminium to be coated by known<br>
methods followed by cleaning and drying; subjecting the cleaned and dried<br>
aluminium to partial oxidation at a temperature in the range of 550°C to 615°C in<br>
air for a period in the range of 0.5 to 200 hours to obtain partially oxidized<br>
aluminium; exposing the partially oxidized aluminium in the presence of air to<br>
microwave energy of power in the range of 0.8 to 5 KW for a period in the range<br>
of 35 to 90 minutes to obtain aluminium oxide coated aluminium.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention the aluminium to be coated is such as<br>
objects or components of various geometrical shapes such as solid cylinder,<br>
hollow cylinder, solid cube and thin block.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention the cleaning and drying of the<br>
polished aluminium is carried out by thorough rinsing with acetone for a period in<br>
the range of 5 to 15 minutes to obtain a clean sample, followed by air drying at a<br>
temperature in the range of 125°C to 150°C for a period in the range of 15 to 30<br>
minutes.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention the partial oxidation is<br>
effected by subjecting to continuous heating or alternate heating and cooling at a<br>
temperature in the range of 550°C to 615°C in air for a period in the range of 0.5<br>
to 200 hours.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention the thickness of the oxide<br>
coating obtained varies with initial oxide coating thickness prior to microwave<br>
treatment and subsequent microwave exposure time.<br>
In the process of the present invention the aluminium is partially oxidized in order<br>
to form an oxide coating on its surface which is necessary for the subsequent<br>
process step of exposure to microwaves. This is so because metals are known to<br>
reflect out microwave energy. The loss tangent is a measure of the absorption of<br>
microwaves by the material. Materials have extremely high loss tangents lie.<br>
metals reflect microwaves. Polar ceramic materials with intermediate loss<br>
tangents can absorb microwave energy. A polar ceramic is microwave heated by<br>
conversion of the energy absorbed from oscillating field into thermal energy of<br>
lattice. However, energy loss mechanisms are not yet clear and may be linked to<br>
ionic migration, ionic vibration and electronic polarization. For this reason,<br>
aluminium oxide coating absorbs microwave radiation and becomes<br>
volumetrically heated. This generated heat is conducted to the aluminium metal,<br>
which increases the surface temperature of aluminium locally. When surface<br>
temperature of aluminium reaches the oxidation temperature, oxidation occurs<br>
resulting in increment of oxide coating thickness.<br>
The microwave absorption varies linearly with the relative dielectric constant and<br>
the loss tangent of a dielectric material. Both these properties increase with an<br>
increase in temperature. The loss tangent is more affected by temperature in<br>
comparison to the relative dielectric constant. In the present case, aluminium<br>
oxide coating is not able to absorb microwave energy at ambient temperature<br>
because the loss factor is low. But as soon as it is heated above a critical<br>
temperature (Tcrjt.), it starts to absorb and couple more efficiently with microwave<br>
energy due to higher power dissipation. This leads to very rapid increase in local<br>
surface temperature of aluminium. Hence, rate of oxidation increases<br>
significantly which in turn increases the coating thickness. For this reason, oxidecoating<br>
thickness becomes significantly high in case of higher microwave<br>
exposure time. Through microwave treatment, it is possible to coat a partially<br>
oxidized aluminium sample with aluminium oxide coating to a desired thickness<br>
in a few minutes.<br>
In the hitherto known prior art, the drawbacks encountered are such as<br>
complicated process steps, cost-ineffectiveness, cumbersome operations and<br>
stringent requirement of precision control. In the present invention, these<br>
drawbacks have been obviated through the provision of a simpler and costeffective<br>
process for the development of aluminium oxide coated aluminium.<br>
Thus, the novelty of the process of the present invention resides in obtaining<br>
aluminium with a coherent and thicker oxide coating over its surface which has<br>
special applications in aerospace, automotive, marine, electrical and construction<br>
industries. Thickness of the oxide coating can be tailored by varying initial oxide<br>
coating thickness prior to microwave treatment and microwave exposure time.<br>
The inventive steps in the process of the present invention which enables the<br>
novelty resides in partial oxidation of the aluminium object or component followed<br>
by exposure to microwaves to obtain a coherent and thicker oxide coating over<br>
the partially oxidized aluminium.<br>
The process steps of the present invention are:<br>
1. Aluminium objects or components of various geometrical shapes such as solid<br>
cylinder, hollow cylinder, solid cube and thin block are polished and rinsed<br>
thoroughly with acetone for a time period of 5 to 15 minutes.<br>
2. Rinsed samples are dried in air at a temperature in the range of 125°C to<br>
150°C for a time period of 15 to 30 minutes.<br>
3. Dried samples are partially oxidized in the temperature range of 550°C to<br>
615°C in air for 0.5 to 200 hours either continuously or by alternate heating and<br>
cooling.<br>
4. Thereafter the samples are placed inside a microwave oven and microwaved<br>
in air with power in the range of 0.8 to 5 KW for a time period in the range of 35<br>
to 90 minutes.<br>
