				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVaiTIOM<br>
This invention relates to a refrigerator having an air circulation system, and more particularly to a refrigerator having an air circulation system which has a cool air passage and swing-wing system capable of circulating cool air into a refrigerating compartment.<br>
As shown in Fig. 1, a conventional refrigerator is constituted by mounting a freezing compartment door 6 and a refrigerating compartaent door 7 on a refrigerator body 4 of a thermally insulated structure forming a freezing compartment 2 and a refrigerating compartment 3 which are partitioned from each other by an intermediate partition wall 1 therebetween.<br>
A compressor 11 is installed in a motor compartment 11M that is positioned under the refrigerating compartment 3, a condenser and capillary tube(not shown) are mounted in the interior of the body 4 or placed in the machine compartment 11M, and an evaporator 12 is mounted on the rear wall of the freezing compartment 2. The components are connected to each other by refrigerant tubes(not shown) to perform a refrigeration cycle.<br>
A fan 13 for forcing cool air from the evaporator 12 into the freezing compartment 2 and the refrigerating compartment 3,<br><br>
is disposed above the evaporator 12. In order to guide tie flow of the cool air, a grill 14 is placed before the fan 13 and a cool air duct 15a is disposed at the rear wall of the refrigerating compartment 3. Here, numeral 19 indicates a control damper for controlling the quantity of cool air which is introduced into the refrigerating compartment 3, and nuaeral 8 indicates shelves for receiving food items.<br>
As a method for supplying cool air to the refrigerating compartment, a conventional refrigerator generally adopts a ? shelf-by-shelf cool air discharge method. As shown in Fig. 2, in this method a plurality of cool air discharge openings 16a, which are provided for several areas partitioned by the shelves 8, is arranged in a vertical direction on the cool air duct 15a, so cool air is discharged towards the front into each area formed by the plurality of shelves 8.<br>
In the above shelf-by-shelf cool air discharge nethod, uniform distribution of the cooled air is not achieved since areas in the direct path of the blowed air receives more cooled air than the remote areas. Arrangement of the food items further contributes to this problem. As an example, a bulky food item near a cool air discharge opening blocks the flow of air, thus such an area receives less cooled air. Still a further problem exists in that since the cool air discharge openings 16a are<br><br>
perpendicular to the flow direction of cool air going through the cool air duct 15a, only a small portion of the cool air from the evaporator 12 passes through the upper cool air discharge openings, but most of the cool air flows down through the cool air duct 15a and discharges into the refrigerating compartment 3 through the lowest cool air discharge openings 16a. Accordingly, food items on the upper shelves of the refrigerating compartment 3 can not keep a proper refrigerating temperature, whereas the food items on the lower shelves are overcooled. Another problem exists in that some newly stored food items may be at an initial temperature significantly higher than the temperature in the cooling compartment. In this case, a need arises for concentrating the cooled air flow to the warm/hot food item to effect rapid cooling as well as to avoid warming of the immediately surrounding food items. Conventional systems do not offer such a compensating means. Accordingly, the above described situations contribute to an undesired condition in which there may exist a significant variation of temperatures throughout the cooling compartment.<br>
In an attempt to distribute the cool air more evenly, a three-wall cool air discharging method has recently been developed. As shown in Fig. 3, a refrigerator according to this method has a plurality of cool air discharge openings 16s on the side walls of the refrigerating compartment 3 as well as the cool<br><br>
air discharge openings 16a on the rear wall of the refrigerating compartment 3, in order to discharge cool air from the side walls as well as the rear wall.<br>
However, such a refrigerator fails to provide an uniform air flow throughout the cooling compartment. That is, there still exist areas ,such as corners, which are not directly exposed to the cooled air flow. Furthermore, such a refrigerator does not offer means to concentrate the cooled air flow to a specified area depending upon the detected condition of the cooling compartment.<br>
Above inadequacies of conventional refrigerators are especially clear in the case that food items of a higher temperature are stored at remote areas such as the upper or lower corners of the refrigerating compartment.<br>
Since larger-capacity refrigerators suffer the above problems more noticeably and since consumer demand for such refrigerators has been increasing, the need for solving the above problems has become increasingly important.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is, accordingly, an object of this invention to provide a refrigerator capable of maintaining an uniform temperature over<br><br><br>
the whole volume of a cooling compartment by evenly dispersing the evaporated cool air in multi-directions.<br>
It is a further object to provide a refrigerator capable of achieving concentrated refrigeration on a specified area of the compartment depending upon the detected temperature within a plurality of specified areas of the refrigerating compartment.<br>
In accordance with advantageous features of the present invention, a refrigerator is provided with an air distribution apparatus disposed on one wall of a refrigerating compartment, na air guiding means disposed in the air distribution apparatus in a vertical manner and for dividing the volume of the cool air introduced from the upper portion of the air distribution apparatus, and an air distribution means disposed at the front of the air guiding means and for horizontally discharging the divided air through a plurality of openings formed at the front area of the air distribution apparatus.<br>
Alternatively, a refrigerator is provided with an air distribution apparatus disposed on one wall of a refrigerating compartment, and an air distribution means disposed in the air distribution apparatus for horizontally discharging an air divided volume of the cool air introduced from the upper portion of the air distribution apparatus through a plurality of openings<br><br>
formed at the front area of the air distribution apparatus.<br>

a body forming a refrigerating compartment;<br>
an air distribution apparatus disposed on one wall of said refrigerating compartment and an air guiding means disposed in said air distribution apparatus in a vertical manner for dividing the volume of the cool air introduced from the upper portion of said air distribution apparatus;<br>

DETAILED  DESCRIPTION OF  THE  MtfllMD BMBQDmBlTT<br>
Figs. 4 to 15 illustrate various embodiments of a cool air distribution apparatus having an air guiding means. In Fig.4, the refrigerator is comprised of a body 4 shielded by an insulating material which includes a freezing compartment 2 and a refrigerating compartment 3, which are partitioned by an intermediate wall 1. Further, respective compartments 2,3 are equipped with doors 6,7 on the front side of the compartments 2,3. In the refrigerating compartment 3 are installed a plurality of shelves 8 for placing foodstuffs. At the upper portion of the refrigerating compartment 3 is formed the third compartment 9 for allowing the foodstuffs to be stored within a temperature range relative to the individual characteristics of the specific foodstuffs. A vegetable compartment 10 is formed at the lowest portion of the refrigerating compartment 3. A compressor 11 is installed in a motor compartment 11M, and a condenser and a pressure reducing device, which are not shown are installed in the wall of the body 4 or in a motor compartment 11M. Further, the evaporator 12 is mounted in the rear wall of the freezing compartment 2. All of the components are interconnected by a refrigerant tube (not shown) for accomplishing the refrigerating cycle.<br>
Above the evaporator 12 is installed a fan 13 for forcefully blowing the cool air generated from the evaporator 12 into the<br><br>
freezing compartment 2 and the refrigerating compartment 3. To guide the cool air, a grill 14 is mounted in front of the fan 13. At the rear wall of the refrigerating compartment 3 is mounted a cool air distribution apparatus 17 having a cool air passage and discharge openings which will be explained later. Thus, the cool air generated by the evaporator 12 is divided between the freezing compartment 2 and the refrigerating compartment 3. Numeral 5 is a recess for housing the cool air distribution apparatus 17.<br>
As shown in Fig. 5, the cool air distribution apparatus 17 is installed at the central portion of the rear wall 3W of the refrigerating compartment 3. An upper portion of the air distribution apparatus 17 is positioned behind the third compartment 9, while a middle and a lower portion of the air distribution apparatus 17 are positioned behind the area of the refrigerating compartment 3 excluding the third compartment 9 and the vegetable compartment 10. That is, the upper end of the air distribution apparatus 17 is placed adjacent to the intermediate wall 1, and the lower end thereof is placed adjacent to the vegetable compartment 10. The entire height of the air distribution apparatus 17 approximately equals the height of the refrigerating compartment 3 plus the third compartment 9.<br>
The cool air distribution apparatus 17, as shown in Fig. 6,<br><br>
comprises a front plate 24 made from a synthetic resin, a rear plate 25 which is made from insulated material and is assembled with the front plate 24, and a seal plate 34 covering the back face of the rear plate 25. A set of a cool air distributing means of the present invention, which will be described later in various ways, or a swing-wing 26 is detachably provided at the forehead surface of the front plate 24. At the upper end of the swing-wing 26 is provided a motor 28 for operating the swing wing 26. The motor 28 seated on a motor case 29 is installed in the upper portion of the front plate 24. At each aide end of the motor 28 is mounted an indoor lamp 30. Numeral 31 is a lamp cover for shielding the lamps 30.<br>
In the embodiment, since the motor 28 is seal-mounted at the upper portion of the swing-wing 26, moisture of the compartment can not penetrate into the motor 28. Because the moisture or the condensed water flows down due to the force of gravity even when the formation of moisture or the condensed water occurs, there is no worry about its penetration into the motor 28. Further, there is less possibility of the moisture penetration due to the motor being housed by the case 29. The excess cooling caused by the decrease of the motor speed can not occur due to the indirect contact of moist air. Even if the water penetrates, the water is immediately evaporated by the heat from the lamps 30 mounted nearby, thereby preventing the problem of inoperability of the<br><br>
motor 28 due to the penetration of the water and further, the non-function of the swing-wing 26. Thus, this has the advantage that a decrease of the motor speed, with respect to the electrical mal-contact, an insulation failure due to the penetration of the moisture, and the excess cooling in according to the frost of the penetrating water, never occurs. In the embodiment, a geared motor of which the rotation speed is fixed is employed as the operating motor. However, a stepping motor can be employed to control the rotation speed of the swing-wing as well as the rotation of the forward and the reverse of the swing-wing.<br>
Numeral 32 which was not explained is a position sensing switch for controlling the rotation position of the swing-wing 26, which is "on/off"ed by a protuberance 33 provided at the upper end of the swing-wing 26. The number of the position sensing switch 32 is correspondent to the number of respective swing-wings which will be installed in accordance with respective embodiments. Numeral 27 is a grill detachably assembled with the front plate 24 for the protection of the swing-wing 26. The grill 27 prevents foodstuffs housed in the compartment from prohibiting the rotation of the swing-wing 26.<br>
In Fig. 7, the upper portion of the air distribution apparatus 17 comprises an air passage 18 for guiding the flow of<br><br>
the cool air generated from the evaporator 12, a baffle plate 19 for regulating the cool air volume fed into the refrigerating compartment 3 according to the opening/shutting of the baffle plate 19, and a motor 20 for operating the baffle plate 19. The temperature control utilized by these components is achieved by the same method of the conventional method. Numeral 21 is a baffle cover and is integrally formed with the front plate 24 in the embodiment. Numeral 22 is a spacer which is made from an insulated material. Tie thickened spacer 22 prevents the frost, which is caused by amount of cool air through the air passage IS, from generating on the outside wall of the baffle cover 21. Numeral 23 is an air discharge opening which is provided at the upper portion of the front plate 24, by which the cool air through the air passage 18 is discharged into the third compartment 9. In the embodiment, a couple of the discharging openings 23 are formed at the upper portion of the front plate 24. Therefore, the third compartment 9 holds the lower temperature than the refrigerating compartment 3, since the travelling distance of the air from the air passage 18 to the air discharging opening 23 is shorter than that from the air passage 18 to the middle and the lower portion of the air distribution apparatus 17. The swing-wing 26 is disposed at the front of the middle and the lower portions of the front plate 24. The configuration of the sving-wing 26 of the present invention will be explained in detail later.<br><br>
The distribution apparatus 17 formed with an assembled type is detachably installed on the rear wall 3W, and it is more desirable that the front plate 24 is placed against an even surface with respect to the rear wall 3W of the refrigerating compartment 3. That is, as shown in Fig. 6, the seal plate 34 adheres to the rear side of the rear plate 25 which is assembled with the front plate 24, and the swing-wing 26 and the grill 27 are attached to the front plate 24, and then the motor 28 and the indoor lamp 30 are assembled. Finally, the assembly is inserted in the rear wall 3W (Fig.5). Therefore, in comparison to a prior art apparatus in which many individual components are installed in the refrigerating compartment, respectively, the installation work using the components of the present invention is more simple.<br>
In Fig.8, the air distribution apparatus 17 comprises an air passage 15 and the openings 16A,16b,16C which discharge the air from the air passage 15 into the refrigerating compartment 3. The air passage 15 is formed in a longitudinal direction at the rear surface of the air distribution apparatus 17. The openings 16A,16B,16C are penetratedly formed at the air distribution apparatus 17 for connecting the air passage 15 and the refrigerating compartment 3. The openings 16A,16B,16C are provided in an up and down manner along the vertical center line. The air passage 15 is provided with a first duct 35 and a second<br><br>
duct 36, each of which is arranged adjacent to both vertical edges of the apparatus 17 centering at the openings 16A,16B,16C. The position of respective openings 16A,16B,16C corresponds with the partitioned space between the shelves 8 of the refrigerating compartment 3. The uppermost opening 16A is disposed at 3/4H, the middle opening 16B at 1/2H, and the lower opening 16C at 1/3H, assuming that the height of the refrigerating compartment 3 is "H". Since the air passage 15 has first and second ducts 35,36 at each vertical side, and the wing member 26a is placed ahead of the opening 16, where the thickness of the air distribution1 apparatus 17 is thinnest. Also, the protruding height of the distribution apparatus 17 toward the refrigerating compartment 3 is lowered, thereby preventing the available volume of the refrigerating compartment 3 from decreasing.<br>
The upper portion of the first, second duct 35,36 is expanded toward each side of the air passage 18, respectively, while the lower portion of the first, second duct 35,36 toward the vegetable compartment 10. The air, through the air passage 18 by the opening of the baffle plate 19 (Fig.7), is branchedly flowed into the first, second ducts 35,36. Most of the air is flowed down along the ducts 35,36 jto be discharged into the refrigerating and vegetable compartments 3, 10. The remaining volume of the air is discharged toward the third compartment 9 through the discharging opening 23 (Fig.8).<br><br>
For guiding the downflowing air into the refrigerating compartment 3, the air passage 15 comprises a first branch duct 37 which connects the first duct 35 and the opening 16, and a second branch duct 38 which connects the second duct 36 and the opening 16. Thus, the air flowing along the first, the second ducts 35,36 is guided to the first and second branch ducts 37A,37B,37C, 38A,38B,38C, thereby discharging into the refrigerating compartment 3 through respective openings 16A,16B,16C. The wide inlet of the branch ducts 37,38 has the configuration that the upper portions 37U,38U are rounded and the lower portion is shaped to the shoulder 371,372,373 in which the middle shoulder 372 is more extended outwardly ( the right and the left hand of Fig.8) than the uppermost shoulder 371, and the lower shoulder 373 is more extended outwardly than the middle shoulder 372. Therefore, since the earlier discharging air through the air passage 18 along the first 35 and the second duct 36 has a longer length to travel, the temperature of the air is higher. The lower it goes, the greater amount of air is needed. The configuration of the branch ducts 37,38 as above is very helpful to minimize the deviation of the air temperature in respect to the height of the refrigerating compartment 3.<br>
Furthermore, to feed the cool air in a right or a left hand direction into the refrigerating compartment 3, at the opening 16A comprising an upper portion 16U and a lower portion 16L, the<br><br>
upper portion 16U is offsettingly formed toward the first branch duct 37A with respect to the second branch duct 38A, while the lower portion 16L is offsettingly formed toward the second branch duct 38A with respect to the first branch duct 37A. The air through the opening 16A is discharged in each different direction, thereby causing the smooth discharge flow without the head-to-head collision into the refrigerating compartment 3. Next, in the opening 16B adjacent to the opening 16A, the position of the upper, lower portions 16U',16L" are reversed with respect to that of upper, lower portions 16U",16L". That is, the upper portion 16U' is offsettingly formed toward the first branch duct 37B with respect to the second branch duct 38B, while the lower portion 16L' is offsettingly formed toward the second branch duct 38B with respect to the first branch duct 37B. Further, at the lowest opening 16C, the position of the upper,lower portions 16U".16L" are reversed with respect to that of the upper,lower portions 16U',16L'. That is, the position of the upper,lower portions 16U',16L' are the same as that of the upper, lower portions 16U,16L of the upper opening 16A. In the above structure, the quicker the air is discharged through the air passage 18, the more the temperature of the air rises. The temperature of the air reached at the second branch duct 38A is higher than that of the air reached at the first branch duct 37A. Alternatively, at the opening 16B, the relation of the temperature is revered. Also, at the opening 16C, the relation of<br><br>
the temperature is the same as the uppermost opening 16A. That slightly compensates the deviation of the temperature between the right and the left side of the refrigerating compartment.<br>
Fig.9 shows a first embodiment of the swing-wing or air distributing means 126. The swing-wing 126 comprises a wing member 126a and a columnar member 126b. The wing member 126a is formed as a plate extending vertically, and is integrally assembled to the columnar member 126b. The columnar member 126b is extended along the longitudinal center of the wing member 126a which is used as the rotating shaft of the wing member 126a. The upper end of the swing-wing 126 is connected to an output shaft of the driving motor (Pig.6) to operate the swing-wing 126. Further, the protuberance 133 is provided at the upper end of the swing-wing 126 for controlling the rotation position of the swing-wing 126 when the localized flow in the refrigerating compartment 3 is required. It is more desirable that a couple of swing-wings 126 are installed in the front of the openings 16A,16B,16C to evenly discharge the air coming into the refrigerating compartment 3 through respective openings. One of the swing-wings is rotably disposed in the front of the openings with shifting toward the right portion of the openings. That is, the longitudinal center line of the columnar member 126b is parallelized with a vertical center line of right portion 16U,16L',16U" of respective openings 16A,16B,16C (Fig.8). The<br><br>
other of swing-wing is rotably disposed in the front of the openings with shifting toward the left portion of the openings. That is, the longitudinal center line of the columnar member 126b is parallelized with a vertical center line of left portion 16L,16U',16LM of respective openings 16A,16B,16C (Fig.8).<br>
First, the compressor 11 and the evaporator 12, in Fig.4, are operated and the cool air is generated by the heat-exchange with the circumference of the evaporator 12. The cool air is moved into the freezing 2 and the refrigerating compartment 3 by the fan 13 along the arrow. Depending on the temperature of the refrigerating compartment 3 the shutting/opening operation of the baffle plate 19 (Fig.7) is controlled. As the baffle plate 19 is opened, the cool air from the evaporator 12 is fed into the air passage 18 as shown in Fig.8, and the air is divided into the right and the left side of the upper portion of the air distributing apparatus 17. A part of the cool air is discharged into the third compartment 9 through the air discharge opening 23 (Fig.5), while most of the cool air is discharged into the refrigerating 3 and the vegetable compartment 10 after flowing along the first 35 and the second duct 36.<br>
In Fig. 8, the air along the ducts 35,36 is guided by the respective branch ducts 37,38 so as to be discharged through the openings 16 in sequence from the upper to the lower. Further, the<br><br>
air through the openings is distributed to the right or the left side direction by the rotation of the swing-wing 126 for generating even cooling of the refrigerating compartment. In the embodiment, the swing-wing 126 is operated by a geared motor at a constant speed. The geared motor can also be substituted by a stepping motor which has a variable rotating speeds if so desired.<br>
However, in the specified area, if too many foodstuffs are placed or a relatively hot food is disposed, the balance state of uniform cooling is disrupted to create a difficulty of uniform cooling in a refrigerating compartment. To solve the problem, the concentrated cooling to the specified area needs to be employed.<br>
Figs.lOA,10B and IOC show the condition of the left-side, the central and the right-side concentrated cooling, respectively. The concentrated cooling can be achieved by aiming the air flow toward a predetermined direction under the command of the control system, as well as the above-mentioned three directions. To determine the direction of the concentrated cooling or the discharge direction of the cool air, a right space or first temperature sensor 52 is installed at the upper central portion of the right wall of the refrigerating compartment 3 and a left space or second temperature sensor 53 is installed at the lower central portion of the left wall of the refrigerating<br><br>
compartment 3 as shown in Fig.5. The temperature sensors 52,53 as well as the position sensing switch 32 (Fig.6) are connected to a control member (not shown) by a conventional method. Further, the motor 28 for rotating the swing-wing 126 is connected to the control member. These components can detect the temperature variance in the refrigerating compartment to achieve the effective concentrated cooling.<br>
Fig. 11 illustrates the state of the operation of the position sensing switch 32 which determines the datum position of the swing-wing 126, and the protuberance 133 which is contactedly rotated against the position sensing switch 32. The protuberance 133 rotates in the arrow direction together with swing-wing 26 so as to be operated as shown in Figs.11A,11B, 11C. Fig.llC shows the moment that the electrical point of the position sensing switch 32 is released, which regards the datum position of the swing-wing in the embodiment. The protuberance of the contacting portion to the position sensing switch is shaped in a smooth rounded manner for preventing any noise generated by the sudden release of the switch.<br>
The rotation degree of the swing-wing 126 is controlled by a control member and the position sensing switch 32 which is "on/off"ed by the protuberance 133 of the swing-wing 126. In the embodiment, the time when the protuberance 133 is contactedly<br><br>
released from the position sensing switch 32 is set as the datum time (Fig.llC). The period of the rotation of the swing-wing is checked by a control member, thereby producing the degree of the rotation. For example, assuming that the rotation speed of the swing-wing 126 is 6 rpm, the swing-wing 126 rotates during 10 seconds from the datum point, thereby rotating one turn.<br>
Next, when the concentrated cooling is required for the left side, the swing-wing 126 is temporarily fixed toward the left direction so that the major part of the cool air flow is headed toward the left side as shown in Fig.lOA. Further, when the concentrated cooling is required to the center area, the swing-wing 126 is temporarily fixed in the central direction so that the major part of the cool air flow is headed toward the central area as shown in Fig. 1 OB. Furthermore, when the concentrated cooling is required for the right side, the swing-wing 126 is temporarily fixed toward the right direction so that the major part of the cool air flow is headed toward the right side as shown in Fig.IOC.<br>
In the following descriptions of the various embodiments of the swing-wing, the same numerals and letters are used for elements which function the same as those of the first embodiment, and a further description for the elements is omitted.<br><br>
Fig.12 shows a modified example of the first embodiment. The swing-wing 126' comprises a columnar member 126b extended up and down, and a distributing wing 147' which is disposed at the columnar member 126b in an eccentric manner and is formed like an oval in a cross-section. It is more desirable that a couple of swing-wings 126' are installed at the front of the openings 16A,16B,16C as described in the first embodiment.<br>
Fig.13 shows a second embodiment of the swing-wings 226R,226L. Each swing-wing 226R,226L comprises a plurality of wing members 241A, 241B and 241C and a columnar member 126b, respectively, in this example, since the right portion 16U of the opening 16A of the air distributing apparatus 17 (Fig.8) is offsetly disposed in respect to the left portion 16L thereof, a couple of swing-wings may be employed to achieve the effective air discharge. That is, one 226R of the swing-wings is rotably disposed in the front of the right portion 16U,l6L'and 16UM of the openings 16A,16B and 16C, while the other 226L of the swing wings is rotably disposed in the front of the left portion 16L,16U'and 16L" of the openings 16A,16B and 16C. The wing member 241A comprises a dividing member 244A provided with a rounded plate, and a distributing wing 247 provided perpendicularly on the dividing member 244A. Each dividing member 244A,244B,244C is disposed at each lower boarder of the opening, i.e. the dividing<br><br>
member 244A of the right swig-wing 226R is at the lower boarder of the right portion 16U of the opening 16A, while the dividing member 244A of the left swing-wing 226L is at the lower boarder of the left portion 16L of the opening 16A. The diameter of respective dividing members 244A,244B and 244C approximately equals the width of the right or left portion of respective openings 16A,16B and 16C.<br>
In the right swing-wing 226R, the distributing wing 247 is provided with a concave 250 and a convex 251 which are rounded in series, respectively. That is, the concave 250 and the convex 251 are smoothly connected to fee formed in a "S" shape. The height of the distributing wing 247 is the same as the height of respective right or left portions of respective openings. Utilizing the configuration of the distributing member on the dividing member, the cool air is prevented from leaking.<br>
Next, the distributing wing 247 of the left swing-wing 226L has a different position with respect to that of the right swing-wing 226R. In the right swing-wing 226R, the concave 250 is disposed in the same direction with respect to that of the protuberance 133 of the columnar member 126b, while the convex 251 is disposed in the opposite direction with respect to that of the protuberance 133 of the columnar member 126b. In the left swing-wing 226L, the convex 251 is disposed in the same direction<br><br>
with respect to that of the protuberance 133 of the columnar member 126b, while the concave 250 is disposed in the opposite direction with respect to that of the protuberance 133 of the columnar member 126b. The disposition of the distributing wing 247 is for reducing the flow resistance, corresponding to the disposition of the right, left portions 16U,16L of the opening 16A. The air guided by the distributing wing 247 impinges on the convex 251 largely, and flows over the convex 251, thereby remarkably reducing the flow resistance.<br>
The cool air generated from the evaporator 12, as shown in Fig.8, is mostly discharged into the refrigerating 3 and the vegetable compartment 10 after flowing along the first duct 35 and the second duct 36. Thus, the air guided through the first branch duct 37A at the right side is impingedly flowed onto the convex 251 of the right distributing wing 226R, while the air guided through the second branch duct 38A at the left side is impingedly flowed onto the convex 251 of the left distributing wing 226L, which develops a main flow. Further, the horizontal platelike dividing member keeps the weak air discharged in approximately a horizontal direction into the refrigerating compartment even when the swing-wing is in the slow rotation mode.-<br>
When the concentrated cooling is required for the specified<br><br>
area of the refrigerating compartment, the concentrated cooling as shown in Figs.10A,10B,IOC is achieved by using the protuberance 133 provided at the upper end of the columnar member 126b.<br>
Fig.14 shows a modified example of the second embodiment. The swing-wing has the same components as the second embodiment in Fig. 13. Additionally, the swing-wing comprises a plurality of grooves 245 formed on the circumference of respective dividing members 241A,241B,241C along the extended direction of the columnar member 126b. The grooves 245 are for the cool air which is not discharged through the grill 27 yet (Fig. 7). The remaining air above the dividing member 241A actively flows down through the grooves 245 as well as the gap G between the rear surface of the grill 27 and the circumference of the swing-wings 226R*, 226L'.<br>
Figs.l5A,15B illustrate a third embodiment of the swing-wing 326. The swing-wing 326 comprises a plurality of wing nembers 326a and a columnar member 326b. The wing member 326a comprises a dividing plate 344 having an upper plate 341, a middle plate 342 and a lower plate 343 which are spaced apart from each other in a horizontal manner. The wing member 326a further comprises a distributing wing 347 which provides a first inducing wing 345 formed perpendicularly between the upper plate 341 and the middle<br><br>
plate 342 and a second inducing wing 346 formed perpendicularly between the middle plate 342 and the lower plate 343. In the embodiment, three sets 361,362,363 of the wing member 326a formed with the dividing plate 344 and the distributing wing 347 are integrally assembled with the columnar member 326b ( the remaining one 349 will be explained later.)* That is, the swing-wing 326 is formed so that the three wing members 326a having the dividing plate 344 and the distributing wing 347 are integrally attached to the columnar member 326b. The upper end of the swing-wing 326 is connected to an output shaft (Fig.6) of the driving motor 28 to operate the swing-wing 326. It is more desirable that the columnar member 326b is shaped with a crisscross in a cross-section.<br>
Numeral 349, in Figs. 15A and 15B, is a phantom (dummy) wing set which is irrelevant to the discharge of the cool air. Since no opening is provided at the corresponding position to the phantom (dummy) wing 349, it is directly unrelated to the discharging flow of the air. However, through the gap G (Fig.7) between the rear surface of the grill 27 and the circumference of the swing-wing 26, the cool air is fed into the space housing of the phantom (dummy) wing 349. The air in the space is stirred by the phantom (dummy) wing 349 to increase the distribution effect with respect to the flow-down air to the lower wing member 363. Further, the balancing arrangement of the wing member provides<br><br>
external harmony.<br>
The swing-wing 326 is detachably formed as shown in Fig.l5B to solve the problem rising from the manufacturing process. The upper portion of the swing-wing 326 consists of the upper wing member 361 and the middle wing member 362, and the lower portion of the swing-wing 326 consists of the lower wing member 363. In the case that the respective distributing wings 347 are molded in a different direction from each other ( will be explained in more detail later), it has the difficulty that one cavity molding form can not be used. Therefore, the swing-wing 326 is divided into two portions. In the upper portions 361,362 of the swing-wing 326 the one edges 347E,347E' of the distributing wings 345,346 are arranged in a 90°C to each other. In the lower portion 349,363 of the swing-wing 326 the one edges 347E",347E"'of the distributing wing 345,346 are arranged in a zero or 180°C to each other. Thus, if the assembling degree between the upper portions 361,362 and the lower portions 349,363 can be changed, the layout of the whole distributing wings 345,346 can be varied. In the embodiment, the edges 347E",347E"'are disposed in the center between the one edge 347E and the one edge 347E'. Fig.l5C shows a modified example of the third embodiment, which illustrates the swing-wing 326 without the phantom (dummy) wing set 349.<br>
As the previous illustration, the respective distributing<br><br>
wings 347 are placed in front of the corresponding openings 16 (Fig.8), and the position of the dividing plate 344 and the openings 16 correspond to the partitioned space between the shelves 8 of the refrigerating compartment 3. The swing-wing 326 is disposed in front of the front plate 24 as shown in Fig. 6. The middle plate 342 of the dividing plate 344 is disposed at the border between the right portion 16U and the left portion 16L (Fig.8). The upper plate 341 is disposed above the middle plate 342 with the height of the right portion 16U, while the lower plate 343 is disposed beneath the middle plate 342 with the height of the left portion 16L. The upper 341, the middle 342 and the lower 343 plates have the same diameter. The diameter approximately equals the horizontal width of the opening 16 so as to prevent the cool air leakage. The space defined by the upper plate 341, the middle plate 342 and the right portion 16U forms an individual rotating passage with the help of the duct extended from the branch duct 37A. Also, the space defined by the middle plate 342, the lower plate 343 and the left portion 16L forms another individual rotating passage with the help of the duct extended from the branch duct 38A. The individual rotating passages help the air discharge forward in the refrigerating compartment without descending. It keeps the weak air discharged in approximately a horizontal direction into the refrigerating compartment even when the swing wing is in the slow rotation mode.<br>
Further, the first distributing wing 345 and the second distributing wing 346 are disposed with a symmetrical shaft. In more detail, the inducing wings 345,346 are provided with a concave 350 and a convex 351 which are rounded in series, respectively. That is, the concave 350 and the convex 351 are smoothly connected to be formed in a "S" shape. Thus, the air is smoothly discharged along the first, second inducing wings 345,346 through the opening 16. Next, the first inducing wing 345 has a different position with respect to the second inducing wing 346. The concave 350 of the first inducing wing 345 is reversely positioned to the convex 351 of the second inducing wing 346, while the convex 351 of the first inducing wing 345 is reversely positioned to the concave 350 of the second inducing wing 346. The disposition of the inducing wings 345,346 is for reducing the flow resistance, corresponding to the disposition of the right, left portions 16U,16L. The air guided by the inducing wings 345,346 impinges on the convex 351 largely, and flows over the convex 351, thereby remarkably reducing the flow resistance. The convex 351 of the first distributing wing 345 is disposed to the slight right side of the opening 16A. Alternatively, the convex 351 of the second distributing wing 346 is disposed to the slight left side of the opening 16A. Thus, the air guided through the first branch duct 37A at the right side is impingedly flowed onto the convex 51 of the first inducing wing 345, while the air guided through the second branch duct 38A at the left side is<br>
impingedly flowed onto the convex 51 of the second distributing wing 346, which develops the main flow.<br>
Similar to forenentioned embodiments, a concentrated cooled air flow is also needed in this embodiment. Assuming that the edge 347E of the upper wing member 361 is the basis, the edge 347E' of the middle wing member 362 is disposed at about 90°C, and the edge 347E"' of the lower wing member 363 is disposed at about 45°C. Since the upper, the middle and the lower distributing wings 361,362,363 are' arranged in a different directional degree to each other, the impinging point and the discharging direction onto/from the distributing wing 347 of the cool air is variant, thereby causing the load applied to the distributing wing 347 to diminish. If the edges 347E,347E', 347E",347E"'of the inducing wings 345,346 are aligned, the cool air discharged from even the different rotating position impinges onto the distributing wing in the same direction, causes excessive load on the swing-wing. In the embodiment, the degrees of the arrangement of the distributing wing sets are different from each other and the problem of the excessive load can not occur.<br>
The edges 347E,347E',347E"' are disposed within about 90°C independent of the rotating position of the swing-wing 326. At the same time, the other edges are disposed within about 90°C at<br>
the opposite side.<br>
By using various angular disposition of the edges, the cooled air discharged through the openings is concentratedly blowed within about 90°C toward the specified area i.e. the leftside, the center and the right-side area of the refrigerating compartment illustrating in Figs.lOA,10B, IOC, respectively. The operation of the concentrated cooled air flow is performed using the protuberance 133 provided at the upper end of the columnar member 126b as the operation of Figs.11A,11B,11C.<br>
In this embodiment, a single swing-wing 326 is employed, since the characteristic of the configuration of the swing-wing 326 is matched with the nature of the air flow through the openings of the air distribution apparatus 17.<br>
Figs.16 to 21 illustrate various embodiments of a cool air distribution apparatus, without an air guiding means, adopting to the previous embodiments. Fig.16 shows the rear perspective view of another air distribution apparatus without the air guiding means comprising the air passage 15, the openings 16 and the related components. Except for the air guiding means, every component of Fig. 16 is identical to that of Fig. 8. The same component parts as those in 16 are designated by the same reference numerals as in Fig.8, but the detailed description of<br>
parts will be omitted.<br>
Fig.17 shows a fourth embodiment of the swing-wing 426R,426L. Each swing-wing 426R,426L comprises a wing member 427 and a columnar member 126b, respectively. The wing member 427 is formed as a plate extending in a vertical direction, and has a plurality of dividing members 444A, 444B and 444C which are equally spaced from each other in a horizontal manner and are formed perpendicularly on one vertical side surface of the wing member 427. In this example, although dividing members are provided on only one vertical side surface of the wing member 427, both vertical side surfaces can provide a plurality of dividing members. The position of respective dividing members 444A,444B,444C correspond to the respective lower edges of a plurality of meshed openings ( not shown ) of the grill 27. Further, respective openings of the grill 27 match up with the partitioned space between the shelves 8 of the refrigerating compartment 3. Therefore, the air flow down through the ducts 35A,36A is guided into respective partitioned spaces of the refrigerating compartment 3.<br>
The cool air generated from the evaporator 12, as shown in Fig. 16, is mostly discharged into the refrigerating 3 and the vegetable compartment 10 after flowing along the first duct 35A<br>
and the second duct 36A. Thus, the air guided through the first duct 35A at the right side is directed by being impinged on respective dividing members 444A,444B,444C in sequence, while the air guided through the second duct 36A at the left side is directed by being impinged on respective dividing members 444A,444B,444C in sequence. Further, the horizontal platelike dividing members 444A,444B,444C keeps the impinged air turning in approximately a 90 degree direction into the refrigerating compartment.<br>
When the concentrated cooling is required for the specified area of the refrigerating compartment, the concentrated cooling as shown in Figs.10A,10B,IOC is achieved by using the protuberance 133 provided at the upper end of the columnar member 126b.<br>
Fig.18 shows a modified example of the fourth embodiment. The swing-wing has the same components as the fourth embodiment in Fig. 17. The swing-wing 426' comprises a columnar member 126b extended vertically, and a wing member 447' which is disposed at the columnar member 126b. It is more desirable that a couple of swingrwings 426' are installed at the first duct 35A and second duct 36A described in the fourth embodiment. Alternatively, a plurality of distributing wings 444D,444E,444F slant downwardly outward.<br>
Fig.19 illustrate a fifth embodiment of the swing-wing 526. The swing-wing 526 comprises a wing member 547 and a columnar member 126b. The wing member 547 is formed as a helix shaped plate extending in a vertical manner. Further, the wing member 547 is integrally assembled with the columnar member 126b. Furthermore, the protuberance 133 is provided at the upper end of the swing-wing 526 for controlling the rotation position of the swing-wing 526 when the localized flow in the refrigerating compartment 3 is required. It is more desirable that a couple of swing-wings 526 are installed at the first duct 35A and second duct 36A described in the fourth embodiment. The helix angle of the wing member 547 is more slanted at the inlet or upper portion than at the outlet or lower portion. The volume of the air impinged on the lower portion of the wing member 547 is larger than that on the upper portion thereof. This satisfies the need that the lower it goes, the greater amount of air is needed.<br>
The cool air generated from the evaporator 12, as shown in Fig. 16, is mostly discharged into the refrigerating 3 and the vegetable compartment 10 after flowing along the first duct 35A and the second duct 36A. Thus, the air guided through the first, second ducts 35A,36A at the right or the left side is impinged onto the upper portion of the wing member 547. Part of the impinged air is discharged into the partitioned space between the shelves  8 of the refrigerating compartment 3 through the<br>
corresponding upper opening of the grill 27. Through the middle opening of the grill a greater volume of the air than the upper one flows into the corresponding space. In the lowest opening of grill, a greater volume of the air than that of the middle opening is discharged into the space of the refrigerator 3.<br>
When the concentrated cooling is required for the specified area of the refrigerating compartment, the concentrated cooling as shown in Figs.10A,10B,IOC is achieved by using the protuberance 133 provided at the upper end of the columnar member 126b.<br>
Fig.20 shows a modified example of the fifth embodiment. The swing-wing has the same components as the fifth embodiment in Fig. 19. The swing-wing 526' comprises a columnar member 126b extended vertically, and a wing member 547' which is disposed at the columnar member 126b. Alternatively, the configuration of the wing member 547' has an angular helix.<br>
Fig.21 illustrate a sixth embodiment of the swing-wing 626. The swing-wing 62 6 comprises a hollow cylindrical member 626b and a columnar member 126b protruded upward or downward from both upper and lower ends of the cylindrical member 626b, around which the cylindrical member 626b is rotated. The protuberance 133 is provided at the upper end of the upper columnar member 126b for<br>
controlling the rotation position of the swing-wing 626 when the localized flow in the refrigerating compartment 3 is required. It is more desirable that a couple of swing-wings 626 are installed at the first duct 35A and second duct 36A described in the fourth embodiment. Further, a helix wing member 647 is formed on the interior wall of the cylindrical member 626b. One side edge 647a of the helix member 647 is slants downward and contactedly formed along the interior wall of the cylindrical member 626b. Another side edge 647b of the helix member 647 slants and is almost perpendicularly extended toward the rotating center of the cylindrical member 626b. On the wall of the cylindrical member 626b, there are a plurality of openings 66A,66B,66C which are spaced from each other in a horizontal manner. The position of respective openings 66A,66B,66C corresponds with the partitioned space between the shelves 8 of the refrigerating compartment 3. At the same traverse point of the slant of the helix member 647, the one side end edge 647a of the helix member 647 is horizontally formed, while the other side end edge 647b thereof is slanted upwardly. The slant upward angle of the inner edge 647b in respect with the outer edge 647a is in the lowest at the upper opening 66A, while that is in the highest at the lower opening 66C. Thus, the slant upward angle is in the middle at middle opening 66B. Due to the configuration of the slant, the less amount of air is discharged through the upper opening 66A, and the greater amount of air is discharged through the lower<br>
opening 66C.<br>
The cool air generated from the evaporator 12, as shown in Fig. 16, is mostly discharged into the refrigerating 3 and the vegetable compartment 10 after flowing along the first duct 35A and the second duct 36A. Thus, the air guided through the first, second ducts 35A,36A at the right or the left side is impingedly flowed onto the slant of the helix member 647 adjacent to the upper opening 66A. Part of the impinged air i6 discharged into the partitioned space between the shelves Q of the refrigerating compartment 3 through the corresponding upper opening 66A of the grill 27. Through the middle opening 66B a greater volume of the air than the upper one flows into the corresponding space. In the lowest opening 66C, a greater volume of the air than that of the middle opening 66B is discharged into the space of the refrigerator 3.<br>
When the concentrated cooling is required for the specified area of the refrigerating compartment, the concentrated cooling as shown in Figs.10A,10B,IOC is achieved by using the protuberance 133 provided at the upper end of the columnar member 126b.<br>
As described in detail above, the uniform refrigeration can be accomplished more effectively by means of various embodiments<br>
of the swing-wings which disperse the discharged cool air.<br>
In the case that there is any temperature deviation in the compartment, the area with a relatively high temperature can receive the concentrating cooling for some period until the uniform temperature is reached. Accordingly, this invention possesses the advantage of achieving the concentrating cooling in any case.<br><br><br><br>
