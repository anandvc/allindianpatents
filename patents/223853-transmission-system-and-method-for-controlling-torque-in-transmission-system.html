				<td>TRANSMISSION SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR CONTROLLING<br>
TORQUE IN TRANSMISSION SYSTEM<br>
The present invention relates to transmissions having control systems for controlling the selection<br>
of gear ratios and a method of controlling torque in the transmission. The present invention can<br>
be used in conjunction with transmission systems of the type described in PCT/GB2004/001976,<br>
and with the apparatus and method for measuring torque in a transmission in PCT/GB2004/<br>
filed simultaneously herewith. The features of each of those documents are hereby incorporated<br>
by reference, though the invention is not to be considered as being limited to transmissions of the<br>
type described.<br>
In conventional single clutch synchromesh transmission systems for vehicles it is necessary to<br>
disengage the transmission from the power source, such as an engine or motor, by operating the<br>
clutch before the current gear is deselected and the new gear is engaged. If the power is not<br>
disengaged when attempting to engage a new gear the syncnrornesh is unable to engage the new<br>
 gear wheel or has to be forced into engagement with the risk of damaging the transmission and<br>
creating torque spikes in the transmission. This is because in most cases the speed of the engine<br>
is not matched to the speed of the new gear. For motor vehicles such as cars having conventional<br>
gearboxes and powered by an engine, tie selection of a new gear ratio typically takes between<br>
0.5 and I second to complete. So, for example, when a higher gear is selected the time delay<br>
allows the engine to reduce its speed [due to its own inertia] to more closely match the speed of<br>
the new gear before the clutch re-connects the engine and the transmission, thereby reducing the<br>
possibility of torque spikes occurring when the power is reapplied-<br>
In transmission systems where the selection of a new gear ratio takes place almost instantaneously<br>
without substantial power interruption, such as the transmission described \n<br>
PCT/G62004/001976, large torque spikes can be generated when the new gear Is engaged under<br>
certain shift conditions. These torque spikes cause shock waves to propagate through the<br>
transmission that can be heard and felt by the occupants of the vehicle. The Shockwaves can<br>
produce a jerky ride- for the car occupants and can lead to wear of transmission components and<br>
the possibility of components failing. Nevertheless it is desirable to use such a transmission in<br>
vehicles since it is more efficient thereby requiring less fuel to operate, produces lower emissions<br>
and increases the performance of the car since the application of power is substantially<br>
uninterrupted.<br>
For a control system to operate successfully it is important for it to incorporate ameans of sensing<br>
operational conditions within the transmission. For example, it is often useful to measure or<br>
calculate the magnitude and the direction of torque within the transmission to operate control<br>
devices that can regulate the torque in the transmission. One approach for measuring torque is to<br>
mount a torque sensor on a transmission output shaft for measuring the amount: of twist occurring<br>
between two known points on the shaft. Torque sensors are very expensive and therefore rarely<br>
used in practice. Another drawback is that since the sensor is mounted on the shaft signals must<br>
be sent from the sensor to a processing unit via a wireless transmission sysstem or otherwise<br>
contact brushes must be mounted about the shaft. There are difficulties in setting up torque<br>
sensors using contact brushes and the brushes wear with use and therefore may lead to inaccurate<br>
readings or failure of the sensor.<br>
Accordingly the present invention seeks to provide transmissions having a control system for<br>
regulating the amount of torque in the transmission during a gear change and means for<br>
measuring the magnitude of torque within a transmission that mitigates at least some of the<br>
aforementioned problems.<br>
According to one aspect of the present invention there is provided a transmission system having a<br>
plurality of gear ratios, selector means for selectively engaging the gear ratios, and a control system<br>
including means for measuring deformation caused by torque in the transmission system in at least one<br>
static component or assembly that is deformed due to torque in thejransmission system and means for<br>
controlling the torque in the transmission system, wherein the control system is arranged to measure<br>
deformation and to adjust the torque in the transmission system according to the measured deformation<br>
and a known relationship between the gear ratios, wherein the known relationship is substantially linear<br>
and values corresponding to the measured deformation are adjusted by a scaling factor.<br>
Each gear ratio causes a different amount of deformation in the component or assembly at a ,<br>
particular magnitude of torque in the transmission due to the differing physical properties and<br>
arrangement of each gear ratio. The known relationship of the amount of deformation caused<br>
when each gear ratio is selected allows the control system to adjust the deformation measured in<br>
accordance with the known relationship when a new gear is selected. The control system can<br>
thereby control the amount of torque in the transmission during the gearshift to produce smoother<br>
gear changes without having to calculate the absolute value of torque in the transmission. Static<br>
components and assemblies relate to components and assemblies other than the rotational<br>
components and assemblies of the transmission. Preferably the static component or assembly<br>
arranged is arranged to support or house rotatable components of fee transmission, a vehicle<br>
chassis or support arrangement between the chassis and the transmission.<br>
Advantageously the known relationship is substantially linear and values corresponding to the<br>
measured deformation are adjusted by a scaling factor. In some embodiments the relationship will<br>
be non-linear and algorithms can be used to adjust the measured values.<br>
Advantageously the control system is arranged to control the rate of change of torque in the<br>
transmission in accordance with the deformation measured.<br>
Advantageously the means for controlling torque in the transmission includes clutch means.<br>
Preferably the clutchmeans has first and second engagementmembers for selectively transmitting<br>
drive from a drive source to the transmission, and control means for controlling the engagement<br>
force between the engagement members. The control means can automatically reduce the<br>
engagement force before the selector means selects an unengaged gear ratio to allow relative<br>
rotational movement between the engagement members when the unengaged gear ratio is<br>
engaged by the selector means.<br>
Advantageously the means for controlling torque in the transmission includes means for<br>
controlling the speed of a drive source. For example, the means for controlling the drive source<br>

Preferably the control system includes means for calculating the magnitude* of torque in the<br>
transmission system and includes estimating means for estimating torque in the transmission<br>
when, the selector means engages an unengaged gear ratio. Preferably the estimating means<br>

accordance with the measured deformation immediately prior to a gear change and the known<br>
relationship between the engaged gear ratio and the unengaged gear ratio.<br>
The control system includes sensor means for sensing the position of the selector means. The<br>
sensor means can be used to accurately measure the position of the selector assembly to identify<br>
which gear ratio is engaged, and which gear ratio is being selected. This enables the control<br>
system to determine which known relationship should be used to control the torque in the<br>
transmission during a gear change.<br>
Preferably the transmission includes means for identifying fluctuations in the deformation<br>
measurements due to factors other than driveline torque. For example, factors such as vehicle<br>
movement due to undulations in road. Preferably the control system is arranged to record a<br>
plurality of readings and calculate the difference between the measurements, and to control the<br>
torque to account for fluctuations in the deformation measurements [due to factors other than<br>
drive line torque.] If deformation measurements are affected by, for example loading due to an<br>
uneven road surface the control system would control the level of torque to pirevent fluctuations<br>
in the torque in the transmission.<br>
Advantageously the control system may include at least one of means for measuring engine<br>
speed, means for measuring road speed or a vehicle-amounted accelerometer.<br>
Preferably the means for measuring deformation measures the amount of torsional deformatioa<br>
in the component or assembly.<br>
Advantageously the means for measuring deformation determines the direction of torque in the<br>
transmission.<br>
Preferably the component or assembly comprises at least one of a transmission bearing, casing,<br>
support member, mounting, or mounting bolts. Preferably the casing comprises one of the<br>
gearbox casing and the tail shaft casing.<br>
Preferably the means for measuring deformation includes at least one load cell, and preferably<br>
a plurality of load cells, In one embodiment the means for measuring deformation is mounted on<br>
a casing having a longitudinal axis and the casing is arranged such that torque in the transmission<br>
twistingly deforms the casing about the longitudinal axis. Preferably first and second load cells<br>
are mounted on the casing such that the deformation of the casing causes the first and second load<br>
cells to generate different outputs. Preferably the bad cells are arranged in a Wheaistone bridge<br>
circuit<br>
In one embodiment the means for measuring deformation measures the amount of strain in the<br>
component or assembly. The means formeasuring deformation includes at least one strain gauge.<br>
Preferably the strain gauge is arranged in a Wheatstone bridge circuit<br>
According to another aspect of the present invention there is provided a method for controlling torque<br>
in a transmission system having a plurality of gear ratios and selector means for selectively engaging<br>
the gear ratios, including measuring the deformation caused by torque in at least one component or<br>
assembly arranged to support or house rotatable components of the transmission system, selecting an<br>
unengaged gear ratio, adjusting the torque in the transmission system in accordance with the measured<br>

Preferably the method includes controlling the rate of change of torque.<br>
Preferably the method includes estimating the amount of torque in the transmission when an<br>
unengaged gear ratio will be engaged.<br>
Preferably the transmission system includes first and second rotatable shafts, and means for<br>

between the first shaft and the second gear wheel, wherein the selector assembly includes an<br>
actuator, assembly and first and second sets of engagement members that are moveable into and<br>
out of engagement with the first and second gear wheels independently of each other, said<br>
selector assembly being arranged such that when a driving force is transmitted, one of the first<br>
and second sets of engagementmembers drivingly engages the engaged gear wheel, and the other<br>
set of engagement members is then in an unloaded condition, wherein the actuator assembly is<br>
arranged to move the unloaded set of engagement members into driving engagement with, the<br>
unengaged gear wheel to effect a gear change.<br>
The selector assembly can be arranged such that when a braking force is transmitted the first set<br>
of engagement members drivingly engages the engaged gear wheel, and the second set of<br>
engagement members is in an unloaded condition, and when a driving force is transmitted the<br>
second set of engagement members drivingly engages the engaged gear wheel, and the second<br>
set of engagement members is then in an unloaded condition.<br>
The actuator assembly can be arranged to bias the loaded set of engagement meanbers towards<br>
the unengaged gear wheel without disengaging the loaded set of engagement members from the<br>
engaged gear wheel.<br>
The first and second sets of engagement members can be arranged to rotate, in use, -with the first<br>
shaft. Preferably the first shaft is an input shaft and the second shaft is an output shaft and drive<br>
is transferred from the input shaft to the output shaft.<br>

Figures la and lb show a transmission system atrange4 for use in a vehicle such as a motor car<br>
and Figure 1 c is a schematic of a control system for controlling the selection of gear ratios. The<br>
transmission system comprises an output shaft 1 having first and second gear wheels 3,5 mounted<br>
thereon, an input shaft 7 having third and fourth gear wheels 9,11 mounted thereon and a selector<br>
assembly 13. The first and second gear wheels 3,5 are rotatably mounted on the output shaft 1<br>
and the third and fourth gear "wheels 9,11 are formed integrally with the input shaft 7 and are<br>
locked for rotation therewith. The first and second gear wheels 3,5 mesh with third and fourth<br>
gear wheels 9,11 respectively, which are formed integrally with the input shaft, to form first and<br>
second gear wheel pairs 15,17. The input shaft 7 is connected to a clutch 2 having first and second<br>
clutch plates 4,6. The first clutch plate 4 is connected by a first shaft 8 to the output of an engine<br>
10 and the second clutch plate 6 is connected by a second shaft 12 to the input shaft 7 via a fifth<br>
gear wheel 14. The fifth gear wheel 14 is locked for rotation with the second shaft 12. The<br>
arrangement is such that the clutch 2 can selectively apply drive from the engine 10 to the<br>
transmission output shaft 1, via the input shaft 7 and gear ratios 15,17.<br>
First and second sensors 16,18 are located in.the clutch 2 to measure the rotational speeds of the<br>
first and second clutch plates 4,6 respectively. The first and second sensors 16,18 are Hall Effect<br>
type sensors but other types of sensor such as optical sensors or gear wheel speed measurement<br>
devices can be used. The first and second sensors 16,18 are connected to a computer processor<br>
20 that controls the operation of the control system. Optionally, a third sensor 18b can be used<br>
to measure the rotational speed of the engine output shaft The clutch 2 includes an actuator 22<br>
for controlling the pressure, and hence the amount of friction, between the first and second clutch<br>
plates 4,6 and hence the torque that can be transmitted from the engine 10 to the transmission.<br>
The actuator 22 is controlled electronically by signals received from the computer processor 20<br>
to increase or decrease the pressure between the first and second clutch plates 4,6 and thereby<br>
control whether the first and second clutch plates rotate at the same speed (fully engaged) or<br>
whether they move relative to each other (slip occurring). The computer processor 20 can detect,<br>
slip in the clutch 2 from the measured speed of the engine output shaft by detecting changes in<br>
the speed and known properties of the transmission, such as which gear ratio is engaged and the<br>
number of teeth each gear wheel has. Similarly the computer processor 20 can detect clutch slip<br>
by comparing the speed sensors on either side of the clutch. The processor 20 can determine<br>
which gear is engaged by reading the speed sensors on the output side of the clutch (gearbox<br>
input speed) and gearbox output speed.<br>
The computer processor 20 is also connected to a throttle control mechanism 24 for controlling<br>
the speed and torque output of the engine 10. The throttle control mechanism 24 is a throttle pots<br>
mechanismjhat is arranged to. selectively override the driver's control of the engine to enable the<br>
control system to more closely control the torque output of the engine to assist with, maintaining<br>
a target gearbox output torque gradient during rapid gear engagement. Signals sent from the<br>
computer processor 20 to the throttle pots 24 can increase or decrease the engine speed or torque<br>
in accordance with the control signals received, thereby controlling the rotational speed of the<br>
first shaft 8 and the first clutch plate 4. The speed of the engine 10 is measured using a<br>
conventional sensor the output of which is connected to the computer processor 20.<br>
The effect of torque spikes caused when tine selector assembly 13 engages a new gear ratio can<br>
be reduced to an acceptable level, that is to a level that cannot be detected by the occupants of the<br>
vehicle, by reducing the pressure between the first and second clutch plates 4,6 before the new<br>
gear ratio is selected without fully disengaging the plates to allow the clutch plates to slip<br>
(relative rotational movement between the clutch plates) when the selector assembly 13 engages<br>
the new gear wheel and generates a torque spike in the transmission. Preferably the pressure<br>
between the clutch plates 4,6 is reduced to approximately the onset of slip immediately after a<br>
gear change has been initiated, for example manually by the driver moving a gear stick 26 or<br>
automatically by the control system after measuring a certain engine speed, but before the new<br>
gear is engaged. The torque spike generated by the selector assembly 13 engaging the new gear<br>
wheel is dissipated because it causes rapid slip between the clutch plates 4,6 since the clutch<br>
plates are already at the onset of slip before receiving the additional load caused by the torque<br>
spike. This also allows the engine 10 time to adjust its speed to match the speed of the new gear<br>
ratio.<br>
The clutch 2 is housed in a first casing 32, commonly known as a bell housing , and the<br>
transmission is housed in a second casing 34, known as the gearbox casing. The bell housing 32<br>
comprises is a substantially frustum tubular member and the gearbox casing 34 comprises a<br>
tubular member having a rectangular cross-section. First and second end plates 36,33 are each<br>
attached to the gearbox casing 34 by bolts. The end plates 36,38 can be detached from the<br>
gearbox casing 34 to allow maintenance work to be undertaken. The bell housing 32 is fixed to<br>
first end plate 36 by bolts (not shown). The first end plate 36 has a through hole 40 and the<br>
second shaft 12 extends from the second clutch plate 6 through the hole 40 and into the gearbox<br>
casing 34. The first shaft 8 is supported by a bearing 42 within the gearbox casing for rotational<br>
movement relative to the gearbox casing. The bearing 42 is press fit into the first end plate 36.<br>
Tte input shaft 7 is supported by two bearings 44 for rotational movement relative to the gearbox<br>
casing 34. The bearings 44 are press fit into the first and second end plates 36,38.<br>
The second end plate 38 has a through hole 48 and the output shaft 1 extends through the hole<br>
48, into a third casing 50, also known as a tail shaft casing. The output shaft 1 is supported by a<br>
bearing 52 that is press fit in the second end plate 38 for rotational movement relative to the<br>
gearbox casing 34. The tail shaft casing 50 is fixed to the second end plate 38 by a sleeve 52 that<br>
is welded to the second end plate. The tail shaft casing 52 comprises a substantially cylindrical<br>
tube with a closed end 54 that is arranged co-axially with, the output shaft 1. There is a hole 56<br>
in the end' of the tail shaft casing 50 and the output shaft 1 extends through the tail shaft casing<br>
50 and through the hole 56 for connection with a differential (not shown). The output shaft 1 is<br>
supported for rotational movement relative to the tail shaft casing 50 by a bearing 58.<br>
A substantially rigid support arrangement 60 for supporting first and second load cells 62,64 is<br>
mounted on the underside of the tail shaft casing. The support arrangement 60 is mounted<br>
perpendicularly to the longitudinal axis of the tail shaft casing and hence the output shaft 1. The<br>
load cells 62,64 rest on a chassis bar (not shown), which is a structural member of the chassis<br>
extending laterally across the chassis, but are not attached to the chassis bar.<br>
When the output shaft 1 is driven by the engine 10 via the transmission system, torque is<br>
transmitted from the input and output shafts 7,1, along a load path including the bearings<br>
42,44,52,58, the gearbox casing 34, first and second end plates 36,3 8 and the tail shaft casing 50.<br>
The torque in the input and output shafts 7,1 causes thebearings 42,44,52,58, iiie gearbox casing<br>
34, the first and second end plates 36,38 and the tail shaft casing 50 to deform. The extent of the<br>
deformation is proportional to the magnitude of the torque in the output shaft 1 and therefore fee<br>
extent of deformation measured can be used to control the amount of torque applied to the<br>
transmission when selecting between gear ratios. The direction of torque is important since it<br>
indicates whether the engine, vehicle or transmission is under going acceleration or deceleration<br>
(braking).<br>
In the present embodiment the magnitude and fee direction of the torque in the transmission is<br>
measured using the load cell arrangement shown in Figure 1b. When torque is transmitted to the<br>
tail shaft casing 50, the casing deforms by twisting. The support arrangement 60 twists with the<br>
tail shaft casing 50 thereby causing one of the first and second load cells 62,64, to increase the<br>
force applied to the chassis bar and the other load cell to reduce the load applied to the chassis<br>
bar. Readings can be taken from the load cells 62,64. The magnitude of the difference between<br>
the readings from the first and second load cells 62,64 is proportional to the amount of<br>
deformation of the tail shaft casing 50 and hence the magnitude of the torque in the transmission.<br>
Direction of the torque is established by determining which of the first and second load cells<br>
62,64 -has the larger reading.<br>
The tail shaft casing 50 deforms by a different amount for a given magnitude of torque in the<br>
output shaft 1 when different gear ratios are engaged by the selector mechanism 13. This is<br>
because of the different relative positions of the gear wheels along the shafts 1,7, the physical<br>
properties of the gear wheels such as size, geometry, materials used, tooth form etc. Therefore<br>
it is necessary to adjust the values of deformation measured when comparing measured values<br>
generated when different gear ratios are engaged by the selector mechanism. Otherwise<br>
equivalent measured values would relate to different values of torque in the output shaft 1.<br>
The relationship between the amount of deformation caused in the tail shaft casing 50 when the<br>
selector assembly 13 engages different gear ratios, for example the first and second gear ratios<br>
15,17, is known and therefore the amount of torque in the transmission can be controlled by<br>
measuring deformation in the tail shaft casing 50, or some other component or assembly that<br>
supports or houses rotatable transmission components. Typically the relationship is substantially<br>
linear and therefore the amount of deformation measured when the first gear ratio 15 is engaged<br>
can be multiplied by a scaling factor for comparison with deformation measured when the second<br>
gear ratio 17 is engaged. In some embodiments the relationship may be non-linear.<br>
It is necessary for the control system to know the correct relationship to apply when selecting<br>
between gear ratios. When more than one selection can be made and hence a plurality of<br>
relationships exist between different ratios, it is necessary for the control system to know the<br>
position of the selector assembly 13 so that it can Identify the gear ratio currently engaged, the<br>
gear ratio newly selected and the relationship between those gear ratios for adjusting the amount<br>
of deformation measured. This can be- achieved using position sensors 70. The sensors 70 can be<br>
Hall Effect sensors, mechanical switches or optical sensors. The sensors 70 are connected to the<br>
computer processor 20 to accurately inform the processor of position of the bar sets and hence<br>
which gear ratio is engaged. It also provides additional means for controlling actuation of the<br>
selector rod 35 and provides a means of confirming that a gear change has taken place.<br>
When an unengaged gear ratio is selected the amount of torque in the transmission changes and<br>
is determined by the gear ratio selected. For example, a lower gear (e.g. 1 sl gear in a vehicle)<br>
produces more torque in the transmission than selection of a higher gear (e.g. 2nd gear in a<br>
vehicle). When the new gear ratio is selected the torque in the transmission has to adjust from that<br>
determined by the old gear ratio to that determined by the new gear ratio.. It is preferable to<br>
control the increase ot decrease in torque in the transmission to provide a smoother gear<br>
transition.<br>
This is achieved by measuring the deformation in the tail shaft casing 50 immediately after a gear<br>
change has been initiated but before the gear selection is made, and after the new gear ratio has<br>
been selected. The control system uses the known relationship between the two gear ratios to<br>
adjust the deformation measurements made. The first and second load cells 62,64 are connected<br>
to the computer processor 20. The computer processor controls the magnitude of Ihe torque in the<br>
transmission by monitoring the amount of deformation in the tail shaft casing 50 and controlling<br>
the pressure between the clutch plates 4,6 with the clutch actuator 22 and the engine speed and<br>
torque •with the throttle pots 24 to allow the torque to increase or decrease in a controlled manner,<br>
for example at a predetermined rate, to provide a smooth gear change. The control system can<br>
maintain the torque within a predetermined tolerance range of a selected value.<br>
The control system minimises the effect of the torque spike caused when a new gear ratio is<br>
engaged.by adjusting the torque to the level it was prior to the gear change so that the control<br>
system follow a torque gradient to a target torque for the new ratio.<br>
It is also possible to calibrate the torque in the output shaft 1 with the defoicmation measured,<br>
which may be measured for calibration purposes only with a conventional torque sensor. Hence<br>
mere is a known relationship between the amount of deformation measured and the magnitude<br>
of torque acting on the output shaft 1. However, this is not necessary for the control system to<br>
obtain smooth gear changes since it is only necessary to maintain and / or control the rate of<br>
change of torque rather than control the- absolute magnitude of torque, which can be achieved by<br>
monitoring the amount of deformation in the tail shaft casing 50 as the control system adjusts the<br>
clutch pressure and throttle.<br>
Rotational drive is transferred from the input shaft 7 to the output shaft 1 via either the first or<br>
second gear wheel pairs 15,17, with selection of the gear wheel pairs being determined by die<br>
position of the selector assembly 13. The selector assembly 13 engages first and second groups<br>
of drive formations 19,21 located on the first and second gear wheels 3,5 respectively.<br>
The drive formations each comprise groups of dogs. The first dog group 19 is located on one side<br>
of the first gear wheel 3. The dogs are preferably formed integrally with the first gear wheel, but<br>
this is not essential. The first dog group 19 comprises threes dogs evenly circumferentially<br>
distributed about the gear face, i.e. the angle subtended between the centres of a pair of dogs is<br>
approximately 120 degrees (see Figure 3). The second dog group 21, comprises three dogs and<br>
is similarly arranged on one side of the second gear wheel. Three dogs are used because this<br>
arrangement provides large engagement windows, that is the spaces between the dogs, to receive<br>
the selector assembly 13. Large engagement windows provide greater opportunities for the<br>
selector assembly to fully engage the gear wheels 3,5 before transmitting drive thereto. If the<br>
selector assembly 13 drives a gear wheel when only partially engaged it can lead to damage of<br>
the dogs and / or the selector assembly 13.<br>
The first and second gear wheels 3,5 are mounted spaced apart on the output shaft 1 on roller<br>
bearings 23,25 and are arranged such that the sides including the first and second dog groups face<br>
each other.<br>
The selector assembly 13 includes first and second sets of engagement bars 27,29 and an actuator<br>
assembly 31 in the form of a fork assembly 33 and a selector rod 35.<br>
The first and second sets of engagement bars 27,29 are mounted on the output shaft 1 between<br>
the first and second gearwheels 3,5. Referring specifically to Figure 2; the first set of engagement<br>
bars 27 comprises three bars 28 attached to a first connector ring 37, for example using grub<br>
screws. The first connector ring 37 holds the bars 28 in a fixed arrangement The bars 28 are<br>
evenly distributed about the inner circumference of the first connector ring 37 such that their<br>
bases face inwards, and the bars 28 are arranged substantially parallel. The second set of<br>
engagement bars 29 comprises three bars 30 which are held in a similar fixed arrangement by a<br>
i . . . .<br>
second connector ring 39.<br>
The first and second engagement bar sets 27,29 are mounted on the output shaft 1 between the<br>
first and second gear wheels 3,5. The sets of engagement bars 27,29 are arranged to rotate with ,<br>
the output shaft 1 but are able to slide axially along the shaft in response to a switching action of<br>
the actuator assembly 31. To facilitate this, the output shaft 1 includes six keyways 41 formed in<br>
its curved surface with each engagement bar 28,3 0 having a complementary formation in its base.<br>
. The arrangement of the bar sets 27,29 is such that bars of a particular set are located in alternate<br>
keyways 41 and the bar sets 27,29 can slide along the output shaft 1. Each bar set 27,29 moves<br>
as a unit and each bar set can move independently of the other. When there is relative movement<br>
between the first and second sets of bars 27,29, the second connector ring 39 slides over the first<br>
set of bars 27 and the first connector ring 37 slides over the second set of bars 29.<br>
Each bar 28 in the first bar set 27 has a first end 28a arranged to engage the first group of dogs<br>
19 attached to the first gear wheel 3 and a second end 28b arranged to engage the second group<br>
of dogs 21 on the second gear wheel 5. The first and second ends 28a,28b typically have the same<br>
configuration but are opposite handed, such that (he first end 28a is arranged to engage the first<br>
group of dogs 19 during deceleration of the first gear wheel 3 and the second end 28b is arranged<br>
to engage the second group of dogs 21 during acceleration of the second gear wheel 5. Each bar<br>
30 in the second bar set 29 is similarly arranged, except feat the first end 30a is arranged to<br>
engage the first group of dogs 19 during acceleration of the first gear wheel 3 and the second end<br>
30b is arranged to engage the second group of dogs 21 during deceleration of the second gear<br>
wheel 5.<br>
When both the first and second sets of engagement bars 27,29 engage a gear wheel drive is<br>
transmitted from the input shaft 7 to the output shaft 1 whether the gear is accelerating or<br>
decelerating.<br>
The first and second ends 28a,30a,28b,30b of each bar include a substantially vertical face 43 for<br>
engaging dogs 19,21 and a ramp 45 that slopes in the direction of the engagement face 43 to<br>
ensurethatthebars28,30disengagefi'omthedogs 19,21 to prevent the transmission from locking<br>
up; When the bars of the first and second sets 27,29 are interleaved, as in Figure 2, the dog<br>
engagement faces 43 of the first end 28a of the first set of bars 27 are adjacent the dog<br>
engagement faces 43 of the first end 30a of the second set of bars: 29. When the first and second<br>
sets of bars 27,29 are fully engaged with a gear a dog is located between each pair of adjacent<br>
engagement faces 43. The dimensions of the dogs 19,21 and the ends of the biars are preferably<br>
such that there is little movement of a dog between the engagement face 43 of the acceleration<br>
bar and the engagement face 43 of the deceleration bar when the gear moves from acceleration<br>
to deceleration, or vice versa, to ensure mat there is little or no backlash in the gear.<br>
Preferably the bars are configured to be close to the output shaft 1 to prevent significant cantilever<br>
effects due to large radial distances of loaded areas thus reducing the potential for structural<br>
failure.<br>
The actuator assembly 31 is arranged such that the fork assembly 33 is mounted on the selector<br>
rod 35, and the selector rod is provided parallel to the output shaft 1 and adjacent thereto. The<br>
fork assembly 33 includes a fork 46 and first and second annular disc springs 47,49 mounted<br>
about the output shaft 1 (see Figure 1 a). The first and second disc springs 47,49 have three arms,<br>
with each aim having a first part that extends circumferentially around a part of the spring and<br>
a second part that extends radially inwards (see Figure 4).<br>
The fork 46 has afirst pair of arcuate members 51 arranged to engage the first disc spring 47. The<br>
arcuate members 51 are arranged such that the first disc spring 47 can rotate with the output shaft<br>
1 between the arcuate members 51 and such that axial movement of the fork 46 parallel to the<br>
output shaft 1 moves the arcuate members 51 and hence the first disc spring 47 axially along the<br>
shaft if the first disc spring 47 is free to move, or biases the first disc spring 47 to move in the<br>
same direction as the fork 46 if the first disc spring 47 is unable to move. The fork 46 has a<br>
second pair of arcuate members 53 arranged to engage and act upon the second disc- spring 49 in<br>
a similar manner.<br>
The position of the fork 46 relative to the first and second gear wheels 3,5 can be adjusted by<br>
movement of the selector rod 35 in the axial direction.<br>
The inner edges of the first disc spring 47 are fixed to the bars 28 in the first bar set 27 and the<br>
inner edges of the second disc spring 49 are fixed to the bars 30 in fee second bar set 29. When<br>
the fork 46 moves, thereby moving or loading the disc springs 47,49 the engagement bar sets<br>
27,29 are likewise moved or biased to move.<br>
The transmission can be arranged as manual gear shift wherein gears are selected by moving a<br>
gear stick between predetermined positions (as shown in Figure lb), a semi-automatic<br>
transmission wherein the driver initiates a gear change by controlling electronic switches, for<br>
example paddles mounted adjacent the steering wheel, or fully automatic wherein the control<br>
system causes the transmission system to change gear according to certain predetermined<br>
conditions, including for example engine speed and torque.<br>
The processes of selecting a higher gear (i.e. second gear wheel pair 17) when a vehicle is<br>
accelerating (so called up shift) and a lower gear (i.e. first gear wheel pair 15) when the vehicle<br>
is decelerating (so called breaking down shift) using the control system" will now be described<br>
withreference to Figures 5a-5f which for clarity illustrate diagrammatically the movement of the<br>
first and second bar sets 27,29 by the relative positions of only one bar from each set, Figures 1 a-<br>
c and Figures 6 to 9.<br>
Figure 5c shows a condition when the first gear wheel 3 is fully engaged, that is, the bars 28,30<br>
are interleaved with the first group of dogs 19. The selector rod 35 is located such that the fork<br>
46 maintains the first and second bar sets 27,29 in engagement with the first gear wheel 3.<br>
Accordingly, drive is transferred to the output shaft 1 via the first gear wheel pair 15 by the first<br>
bar set 27 when decelerating and the second bar set 29 when accelerating.<br>
Whilst accelerating (first gear wheel 3 rotating in the direction of arrow B in Figure 5c) using the<br>
first gear wheel pair 15, the engagement faces 43 of the bars of the first bar set 27 are not loaded,<br>
whilst the engagement faces 43 of the bars of the second bar set 29 are loaded. When a user, or<br>
the control system, initiates selection of the second gear wheel pair 17, the computer processor<br>
takes measurements from the first and second load cells 62,64 and compares the values measured.<br>
If the value measured by the second load cell 64 is greater than that measured by the first load cell<br>
62 this indicates to the control system that the engine is accelerating and the gear change is<br>
allowable. The processor 20 then sends control signals to the clutch actuator 22 to adjust the<br>
pressure between the first and second clutch plates 4,6. The rotational speed of each clutch plate<br>
is measured by the clutch plate sensors 16,18. Whilst the clutch plates are fully engaged the<br>
sensors 16,18 will show that they are rotating at the same speed. As the pressure between the<br>
clutch plates 4,6 reduces a condition will be reached where the torque transmitted by the clutch<br>
2 will overcome the friction between the first and second plates 4,6 causing the first and second<br>
plates 4,6 to move relative to each other (onset of slip B see Figure 7). The computer processor<br>
20 will detect the onset of slip when there is a measured difference between the rotational speeds<br>
of the first and second clutch plates 4,6. The processor 20 then instructs the actuator 22 to<br>
maintain this pressure (the "slip pressure").<br>
After the computer processor 20 has measured deformation prior to the shift, the processor 20<br>
calculates the amount by which the measurement from the load cells 62,64 needs to be adjusted<br>
to cause the torque value in the transmission to match the torque prior to the shift when the new<br>
ratio is engaged (each ratio causes a different reading in the load cells 62,64 even when output<br>
torque is maintained during a shift as the moment forces change due to the different axial<br>
position, gear diameter, and ratio of each gear). This becomes the first target value upon<br>
engagement of the new ratio.<br>
The processor 20 sends control signals to actuate the selector rod 35 such that the fork 46 acts on<br>
the first disc spring 47, causing the bars of the first bar set 27 to slide axially along the keyways<br>
41 in the output shaft 1 thereby disengaging the bars from the first gear wheel 3 (see Figure 5d).<br>
The fork 46 also acts on the second disc spring 49 to bias the bars of the second bar set 29 to<br>
move towards the second gear wheel 5. However, because the bars of the second bar set 29 are<br>
loaded, i.e. are driving the first gear wheel 3, they cannotbe disengaged from the first gear wheel<br>
3, and therefore the bars of the .second bar set 29 remain stationary.<br>
When the bars of the first bar set 27 slide axially along the output shaft 1, the engagement faces<br>
43 engage Ihe second group of dogs 21 (see Figure 5e) on the second gear wheel 5. As this occurs<br>
the rotation of the second gear wheel 5 is substantially instantaneously locked to the rotation of<br>
the output shaft 1 which generates a torque spike in the transmission. The torque spike causes<br>
substantial slip between the first and second clutch plates 4,6 since the clutch plates 4,6 were<br>
being maintained at the slip pressure, thus dissipating the energy in the torque spike. At the same<br>
time the computer processor 20 measures the amount of deformation in the tail shaft casing 50,<br>
and sends control signals to the clutch actuator 22 and to the throttle pots 24 to adjust the pressure<br>
between the first and second clutch plates 4,6 and to adjust the speed and torque of the engine 10<br>
to cause the deformation measured by the load cells 62,64 to adjust to the final target value for<br>
the new ratio in a controlled manner, for example at a predetermined rate. The control system<br>
prioritises restoring the clutch 2 to full pressure to limit clutch wear and adjusts the engine speed<br>
and torque to allow this to happen, without exceeding the target load cell value at any time until<br>
the final target value is reached. When the clutch 2 is fully engaged control of the throttle is then<br>
returned to the driver as quickly as possible without exceeding the target load cell value set<br>
tolerances at any time until the final target value for the new ratio is achieved whereupon throttle<br>
is returned to driver control and the clutch is restored to full in gear pressure.<br>
The bars of the first bar set 27 then begin to drive the second gear wheel 5 in the direction of<br>
Arrow C inFigure 5e and energy is transmitted from the output shaft 1 to the input shaft 7 by way<br>
of the second gear wheel pair 17. As this occurs, the bars of the second bar set 29 cease to be<br>
loaded, and are free to disengage frorn the first group of dogs 19. Since fee second disc spring 49<br>
is biased by die fork 46, the bars of the second bar set 29 slide axially along the keyways 41 in<br>
the output shaft 1 thereby completing the disengagement of the first gear wheel 3 from the output<br>
shaft 1. The bars of the second bar set 29 slide along the keyways 41 in the output shaft 1 until<br>
they engage the second gear wheel 5} thereby completing engagement of the second gear wheel<br>
5 with the output shaft 1 (see Figure 5f). This method of selecting gear wheel pairs substantially<br>
eliminates torque interruption since the second gear wheel pair 17 is engaged before the first<br>
wheel pair 15 is disengaged, thus momentarily, the first and second gear wheel pairs 15,17 are<br>
simultaneously engaged.<br>
When a gear wheel is engaged by both the first and second bar sets 27,29 it is possible to<br>
accelerate or decelerate using a gear wheel pair with very little backlash occurring when<br>
switching between the two conditions. Backlash, is the lost motion experienced when the dog<br>
moves from the engagement face 43 of the acceleration bar to the engagement face 43 of the<br>
deceleration bar when moving from acceleration to deceleration, or vice versa. A conventional<br>
dog-type transmission system has approximately 30 degrees of backlash. A typical transmission<br>
system for a car in accordance with the current invention has backlash of less than four degrees.<br>
Backlash is reduced by minimising the clearance required between an engagement bar and a dog<br>
during a gear shift: that is, the clearance between the dog and the following engagement bar (see <br>
measurement'A' inFigure 5b). The clearance between the dog and the following engagement bar<br>
is in the range 0.5mm - 0.03mm and is typically less than 0.2mm. Backlash is also a function of<br>
the retention angle, that is, the angle of the engagement face 43, which is the same as the angle<br>
of the undercut on the engagement face of the dog. The retention angle influences whether there<br>
is relative movement between the dog and the engagement face 43. The smaller the retention<br>
angle, the less backlash that is experienced. The retention angle is typically between 2.5 and 15<br>
degrees, and preferably is 15 degrees.<br>
Transition from the second gear wheel pair 17 to the first gear wheel pair 15 whilst decelerating<br>
is achieved by a similar process.<br>
Whilst decelerating in the second gear wheel pair 17 the engagement surfaces 43 of the bars of<br>
the first bar set 27 are not loaded, whilst the engagement surfaces 43 of the bars of the second bar<br>
set 29 are loaded. When a driver or the control system initiates a gear change to engage the first<br>
gear wheel pair 15, the processor 20 sends control signals to the clutch actuator 22 to adjust the<br>
pressure between the first and second clutch plates 4,6. The speed of each clutch plate 4,6 is<br>
measured by the clutch plate sensors 16,18. Whilst the clutch plates 4,6 are folly engaged the<br>
sensors will show that they are rotating at the same speed. As ihe pressure between the clutch<br>
plates 4,6 reduces a condition will be reached where the torque transmitted by the clutch will<br>
overcome the friction between the first and second plates 4,6 causing the first and second plates<br>
to move relative to each other (onset of slip B see Figure 7). The computer processor 20 will<br>
detect the onset of slip when mere is a measured difference between the rotational speeds of the<br>
first and second clutch plates.. The processor men instructs the actuator 22 to maintain the<br>
pressure at the slip pressure. The processor then takes measurements from the first and second<br>
load cells 62,64 and compares the values measured. The computer processor 20 records the<br>
amount of deformation in the tail shaft casing 50 and the direction of the torque.<br>
After the computer processor 20 has measured deformation prioi to the shift, the processor 20<br>
calculates the amount by which the measurement from the load cells 62,64 needs to be adjusted<br>
to cause the torque value in the transmission to match the torque prior to the shift when the new<br>
ratio is engaged (each ratio causes a different reading in the load cells 62,64 even when output<br>
torque is maintained during a shift as the moment forces change due to the different axial<br>
position, gear diameter, and ratio of each gear). This becomes the first target value upon<br>
engagement of the new ratio.<br>
If the value measured by the first loadcelL 62 is greater than the second load cell 64 this indicates<br>
mat the engine 10 is decelerating and an engine braking down shift has been initiated. The<br>
processor then sends control signals to actuate the selector rod 35 such that the fork 46 slides<br>
axially relative to the output shaft L The fork 46 acts on the first disc spring; 47 attached to the<br>
first bar set 27, causing the bars of the first bar set 27 to slide axially in the keyways 41 along the<br>
output shaft 1 in the direction of the first gear wheel 3, thereby disengaging the first bar set 27<br>
from the second gear wheel 5.<br>
The fork 5 also acts on the second disc spring 49 but since the bars of the second bar set 29 are<br>
loaded, i.e. they are drivingly engaged with the dogs 21 on the second gear wheel, the second bar<br>
set 29 remains stationary, however the second disc spring 49 is biased by the fork 46 to move the<br>
second bar set 29 towards the first gear wheel 3.<br>
As the bars of the first bar set 27 slide axially in the keyways 41, the bars 28 engage the dogs 19<br>
on the first gear wheel 3. As this occurs the rotation of the first gear wheel 3 is substantially<br>
instantaneously locked to the rotation of the output shaft 1 which generates a torque spike in the<br>
transmission. The torque spike causes substantial slip between the first and second clutch plates<br>
4,6 since the clutch places were being maintained at the slip pressure, thus dissipating the energy<br>
in the torque spike. At the same time the computer processor 20 measures the amount of<br>
deformation in the tail shaft caging 50, and sends control signals to the clutch actuator 22 and to<br>
the throttle pots 24 to adjust the pressure between the first and second clutch plates 4,6 and to<br>
adjust the speed and torque of the engine 10 to cause the deformation measured by the load cells<br>
62,64 to adjust to the final target value for the new ratio in a controlled manner, for example at<br>
a predetermined rate. The control system prioritises restoring the clutch 2 to full pressure to limit<br>
clutch wear and adjusts the engine speed and torque to allow this to happen, without exceeding<br>
the target load cell value at any time until the final target value is reached. When the clutch 2 is<br>
fully engaged control of the throttle is then returned to the driver as quickly as possible without<br>
exceeding the target load cell value set toleraaces at any time until the final target value for the<br>
new ratio is achieved whereupon throttle is returned to driver control and the clutch is restored<br>
to full in gear pressure.<br>
When the bars 28 engage the dogs 19 on the first gear wheel 3 they begin to drive the first gear<br>
wheel 3 such that energy is transmitted from the input shaft 7 to the output shaft 1 by way of the<br>
first gear wheel pair 150. As this occurs, the bars of the second bar set 29 ceases to be loaded. The<br>
second disc spring 49 acts on the bars of the second bar set 29, causing it to slide axially within<br>
the keyways 41 along the output shaft 1 towards the first gear wheel 3, thereby completing<br>
disengagement of the second gear wheel 5. The second bar.set 29 continues to slide within the<br>
keyways 41 along the output shaft 1 until it engages the first gear wheel 3, thereby completing<br>
engagement of the first gear wheel 3 with the output shaft 1.<br>
If the second load cell 64 has a higher value than the first load cell 62 there is engine acceleration<br>
and the driver / control system, is trying to perform a kick down gear change, that is a gear shift<br>
from a higher gear to a lower gear to accelerate the vehicle, for example when a vehicle is<br>
travelling up a hill and the driver selects a lower gear to accelerate up the bill. In this instance the<br>
engagement surfaces 43 of the bars of the second bar set 29 are not loaded, whilst the engagement<br>
surfaces 43 of the bars of the first bar set 27 are loaded. Under these circumstances it is not<br>
possible to engage the new gear until the previous ratio is fully disengaged. To achieve this, the<br>
computer processor 20 momentarily cuts the fuel supply to the engine to allow the previous gear<br>
ratio to fully disengage before engaging the lower gear. The control system then uses the<br>
engagement bars of the second bar set 29 to engage the first gear wheel 3 in a similar manner, as<br>
described above. The gear change is then made in a similar fashion to the engine braking down<br>
shift.<br>
Figure 5a shows the first and second bar sets 27,29 in a neutral position, that is, neither bar set<br>
is engaged with a gear wheel, the engine is idling. Figure 5b shows the first and second bar sets<br>
moving into engagement with the first gear wheel 3 under the action of the fork 46. The process<br>
of moving from aneutral position into engagement with the first gear wheel 3 is substantially the<br>
same as an accelerating up shift.<br>
Use of the transmission system leads to improved performance, lower fuel consumption and<br>
lower emissions since drive interruption has substantially been eliminated. Also the system is a<br>
more compact design than conventional gearboxes leading to areductionin gearbox weight. The<br>
control system reduces the effects of torque spikes by preventing Shockwaves from propagating<br>
throughout the transmission, leading to smooth gear changes.<br>
It will be appreciated by the skilled man that various modifications can be made to the above<br>
embodiment that are within the scope of the current invention, for example a plurality of selector<br>
assemblies can b e mounted on the output shaft with correspondingpairs of gear wheels to provide<br>
a larger number of gear ratios between the output shaft and the input shaft It is also possible to<br>
have transmission systems with more than two shafts to provide additional gear ratios.<br>
A torque converter can be used instead of a clutch, or in combination with a clutch or in<br>
combination with a plurality of clutches. For example, the output from an engine can be<br>
connected in series to a torque converter and then to a clutch. Alternatively, the output from an<br>
engine can be connected in series with a torque converter and then in parallel to a network of<br>
clutches. The term clutch means should be understood to include all of the above-mentioned<br>
combinations.<br>
The load cells may be mounted on the gearbox casing or some other component or assembly that<br>
supports or houses rotatable transmission components.<br>
Figure 9 shows a strain gauge 66 and a Wheatstone bridge circuit 68 that can be used to measure<br>
the magnitude of torque in the output shaft 1. The strain gauge 66 works on a similar principle<br>
to the load cells in that it measures strains in components or assemblies that house or support<br>
rotatable transmission components along the torque load path such as bearing casings, bearing<br>
mountings, the gearbox casing 34, the gearbox casing end plates 36,38, the bolts used to attach<br>
the endplates 36,38 to the gearbox casing 34 and the tail shaft casing 50. Strain gauges 66 may<br>
also be located on a differential.<br>
Strain is the ratio of the change in a dimension to the original dimension. The strain gauge 66 is<br>
fixedly attached to a component or assembly mat houses or supports rotatable transmission<br>
components for example by using a cement or adhesive. Any distortion in the component /<br>
assembly caused by torque within the transmission will also cause a distortion of the strain gauge<br>
66. The gauge 66 contains conducting material and the distortion therefore results in a change in<br>
its resistance. By measuring this change in resistance the strain can be determined. The change<br>
in resistance is measured through the Wheatstone bridge circuit 68. This has 4 arms, arranged in<br>
a square. Each arm contains either a resistor 70 of known resistance, or a strain gauge 66 - strain<br>
gauges will occupy one, two or four of the arms.<br>
Taking the case of one strain gauge 66 in the Wheatstone bridge, a so called quarter bridge<br>
arrangement, power lines are connected to opposite comers of the bridge, see A and C in Figure<br>
9, to provide an excitation voltage. A measurement is made across the other comers of the bridge,<br>
see B and D in Figure 9. If the resistanceof the strain gauge changes, the current across the bridge<br>
will change (according to Ohms law, V-IR). This change is measured and the amount of strain<br>
can be determined.<br>
The magnitude of fee strain detected in those components or assemblies is proportional to the<br>
magnitude of the torque in the output shaft 1 and therefore the strain gauge 6(5 can be calibrated<br>
in a similar way to the load cells 62,64 for example by using a conventional torque sensor. If<br>
more than one strain gauge is used it is possible to determine the direction of the torque.<br>
Sensors 72 can be used to measure the relative rotational speeds and / or the relative rotational<br>
positions of the sets of engagement bars and the gear wheel to be engaged. This enables the<br>
control system to control the movement of the engagement bars such mat the engagement bars<br>
do not crash into the dogs on gear wheels but rather engage the gear wheels by entering into the<br>
spaces between the dogs. This substantially reduces the amount of wear to the dogs and the<br>
engagement bars. The detectors can be Hall Effect sensors, optical sensors or ;any other suitable<br>
type of sensor for determining the. rotational speed or position of a body.<br>
Rather than using a throttle pots mechanism 24 for controlling the speed of the engine, an engine<br>
control unit 74 can be used to prevent certain pistons from firing and thereby reducing the output<br>
of the engine.<br>
The sensors 70,72 for detecting the positions and / or rotational speeds of the sets of engagement<br>
bars the gear wheels can be used in conjunction with the engine control unit 74 to prevent a<br>
piston, or a plurality of pistons, from firing at the time when the engagem ent bar« engage the dogs<br>
on the side of a gearwheel. This momentarily reduces the amount of torque in the transmission<br>
at the instant when the engagementbars contact the dogs and thereby reduces the effect of torque<br>
spikes in the transmission. The torque in the transmission at that instant is then largely be due to<br>
the inertia of the transmission components. The timing of the misfiring of a piston is accurately<br>
controlled by the computer processor 20 in response to position and / or speed measurements<br>
made by the sensors 70,74.<br>
Optionally, the control system can include a traction control mechanism (not shown) to prevent<br>
wheel spin.<br>
The keyways 41 can be arranged to have dovetailed profiles such that the bars are radially<br>
restrained within the keyways (see Figure 10). Alternatively, the keyways can have a slotted or<br>
T-shaped profile to radially restrain the bars. This provides a significant advantage since it<br>
obviates the need for the first and second connector rings 37,39 to connect the bars together in<br>
the first and second bar sets. This arrangement is preferred since it provides an improved means<br>
of restraining the radial position of thebars 28,3 0 relative to the output shaft 1,, leading to greater<br>
structural integrity of the transmission system. Since the connector rings 37,39 are no longer<br>
required it is possible to reduce the length of the engagement bars 28,30 thereby producing more<br>
compact transmission systems. The alternative keyways can be formed in the output shaft 1 or<br>
can be formed in a separate component from the output shaft which is then fixedly attached to the<br>
output shaft, for example by using a splined arrangement.<br>
Furthermore, it allows embodiments of the invention to be used having only one disc spring 147<br>
(see Figure 11) connecting all six bars together, i.e. bars firorn the first and second sets, with the<br>
actuator arrangement being adapted accordingly. In use, three of the bars would be loaded when<br>
the first gear is accelerating and three not loaded, and moving the fork to bias the disc spring<br>
towards the second gear will move the three unloaded bars out of engagement with the first gear<br>
wheel, leaving three bars still in engagement Once the bars have engaged with the second gear<br>
wheel, the remaining three bars will disengage from the first gear wheel, and under the loading<br>
of the disc springmove into engagement with the second gear wheel. This configuration provides<br>
a highly compact arrangement leading to smaller, lighter gearboxes.<br>
The axial space between the first and second gears to accommodate the selector assembly may<br>
be reduced to around 20mm fortypical road car applications.<br>
Figure 5a shows a recessed 28c in the top of each bar of fee first bar set and a recess 30c in the<br>
top of abar from the second bar set. The recesses 2Sc,30c allow connections to be made between<br>
the bars of the first and second bar sets 27,29 with the arms of the first and second disc springs<br>
47,49 respectively. The shape of the recesses 2Sc,30c is such that the recesses allow each spring<br>
arm to move to a non-perpendicular angle relative to the bars 28,30 during a gear shift. The<br>
recesses 28c,30c shown in Figure 5a are for a two disc spring configuration. For embodiments<br>
having only one disc spring 147 the recesses 28c,30c are located more centrally along the length<br>
of the bars 28,30.<br>
When a ring is not used to fix fee positions of the bars in a set, the bars in. a set can move a small<br>
amount relative to each other in the axial direction. This is because the only connection between<br>
the bars in a set is provided by a deformable disc spring. A single bar is attached to each disc<br>
spring arm and each arm can deform independently of the others, thereby allowing fhe relative<br>
movement between the bars. The bars in a set will nevertheless essentially move in unison.<br>
The number of dogs on. each of the gear wheels is not limited to three, for example any<br>
practicable number of dogs can be used. It has been found that two to eight dogs are suitable for<br>
most applications. Similarly, the number of bars in a bar set can be any practicable rmrxiber but<br>
most preferably the number of bars in a set equals the number of dogs in a group.<br>
It will also be appreciated by the skilled person that fhe transmission system can be adapted such<br>
that the selector assembly and the first and second gear wheels are mounted on the input shaft and<br>
the fixed gear wheels are mounted on the output shaft.<br>
The transmission, system can be used in any vehicle for example, road cars, racing cars, lorries,<br>
motorcycles, bicycles, earth removal vehicles such as bulldozers, cranes, military vehicles,<br>
aircraft such as aeroplanes and helicopters, watercraft such as boats, ships and ho vercrafts. The<br>
system can also be used in any machine that has first and second rotatable bodies wherein drive<br>
is to be transmitted from one of the rotatable bodies to the other, for example in lathes and milling<br>
machines.<br>
