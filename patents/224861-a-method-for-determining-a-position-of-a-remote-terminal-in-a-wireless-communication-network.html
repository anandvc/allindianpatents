				<td>II.	Field of the Invention<br>
[0002]	Tne present invention relates to communication. More particularly, the<br>
present invention relates to a novel and improved method and apparatus for determining position of a remote terminal in a wireless communication system, wherein repeaters are detected and compensated.<br>
III.	Description of the Related Art<br>
[0003]	Wireless communication systems are widely employed to support<br>
communication for a large number of users. Such systems include CDMA, TDMA (e.g., GSM), and other commonly deployed systems. In a wireless conanunicalion system, a user on one remote terminal is able to communicate with another user on another remote terminal (or a wireline unit) via a wireless link to a base station. Each base station is designed to coordinate and facilitate the communication between the remote terminals within its coverage area.<br>
[0004]	Some wireless communication networks employ repeaters to provide<br>
coverage for designated areas within the network or to extend the coverage of the network. For example, a repeater may be used to cover a particular region within a network not covered by a base station due to fading conditions (i.e., a hole within the network). Repeaters may also be used to extend coverage into rural areas (e.g., along a freeway) that are outside the coverage area of the base stations.<br><br>
[0005]	A repeater is a high-gain bi-directional amplifier placed in a network to<br>
receive, amplify, and retransmit a modulated signal. On the forward link, a signal from a "donor" sector (also referred to as a serving base station) is provided to the repeater via a directive antenna or a cable (e.g., a coaxial or fiber optic cable). The repeater then filters, amplifies, and retransmits the donor signal to the remote terminals in the repeater's coverage area. Correspondingly, on the reverse link, the repeater receives signals from the remote terminals within its coverage area, conditions and retransmits the signals to the base station.<br>
[000$]	Besides   facilitating   communication   between   users,   a   wireless<br>
communication system may be designed with the capability to determine the position of a remote terminal. In fact, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has mandated support for an enhanced emergency 911 (E-911) service whereby the location of a remote terminal in a 911 call is required to be sent to a Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP).<br>
[0007]	For position  determination,  a remote  terminal  within  a  wireless<br>
communication system typically measures the arrival times of the transmissions from a number of base stations. The differences between the signal arrival times can be computed and translated into pseudo ranges, which are then used to determine the position of the remote terminal.<br>
[0008]	Various challenges are encountered in measuring the signal arrival times<br>
in a network that employs repeaters. These repeaters introduce additional delays in the remote terminal's time measurements, with the amount of additional delays being unknown in many instances. The additional delays typically cannot be accurately compensated for by the network because it may not be known with certainty whether oc not a remote terminal is under the coverage of a repeater. This uncertainty in the sources for the time measurements can result in an inaccurate estimate of the remote terminal's position and/or an increase in the processing required by the remote terminal to determine its position.<br>
[0009]	Therefore, it is highly desirable to develop techniques mat can detect<br>
whether or not a remote terminal is under the coverage of a repeater, and to possibly account for the additional delays introduced by the repeater, in determining the position of the remote terminal.   These techniques may lead to improved accuracy in the<br><br>
estimated position of the remote terminal and may further reduce fee amount of processing required for position determination,<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
&gt;	£0010]	The invention provides various techniques to detect whether a remote<br>
terminal is under the coverage of a repeater within a network so that the processing to<br>
estimate the remote terminal's position can account for the additional ambiguity<br>
typically associated with die repeater. In accordance with various aspects of the<br>
invention, a determination of whether the remote terminal is under the coverage of a<br>
repeater may be achieved based on (1) a list of base stations expected to be received<br>
while under the coverage of the repeater (i.e., a probable neighbor list) versus a list of<br>
base stations actually received by the remote terminal, (2) the characterized<br>
environment of the repeater, (3) the propagation delays for a transmission received at<br>
the remote terminal, (4) some other criteria, or (5) a combination thereof.<br>
[0011]	The invention further provides techniques to account and/or compensate<br>
for the additional ambiguity resulting from being under the coverage of a repeater. In one aspect, time measurements from repeated base stations may be discarded and not used to estimate the remote terminal's position. In another aspect, the processing to estimate the remote terminal's position may be adjusted to account for the additional<br>
&gt;	ambiguity (e.g., a search window may be widened). In yet another aspect, more than<br>
one multipath received from the same originating base station by the remote terminal<br>
may be used to compute a series of position estimates for the remote terminal, and the<br>
most likely estimate is selected.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE SPECIFIC EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0030]	HG. 1 is a diagram of a wireless communication network 100 that<br>
employs repeaters and supports a number of users. Network 100 may be designed to<br>
conform to one or more commonly known CDMA standards, such as IS-95, W-CDMA,<br>
cdma2000, other standards, or a combination thereof. Network 100 includes a number<br>
of base stations 104, with each base station serving a particular coverage area 102.<br>
Only three base stations 104a through 104c are shown in FIG. 1 for simplicity. The<br>
base station and its coverage area are often collectively referred to as a cell.<br>
[0031]	One or more repeaters 114 may be employed with a particular base<br>
station 104 to provide coverage for regions within the cell that would not otherwise be<br>
covered due to fading conditions (such as region 112a shown in HG. 1) or to extend the<br>
coverage of a network (such as regions 112b and 112c). Each repeater 114 couples<br>
directly or through another repeater to an associated base station 104 via a wireless or<br>
wireline link (e.g., a coaxial or fiber optic cable). Any number of base stations within<br>
the network may be repeated, depending on the particular network design.<br>
[0032]	A number of remote terminals 106 are typically dispersed throughout the<br>
network (only one terminal is shown in HG. 1 for simplicity). Each remote terminal 106 may communicate with one or more cells on the forward and reverse links at any moment, depending on whether the remote terminal is in soft handoff. Typically, one<br><br>
of the cells (e.g., cell 1) is designated as the serving cell (i.e., the reference cell) and the other cells are neighbor cells.<br>
[0033]	A number of base stations 104 typically couple to a base station<br>
controller (BSC) 120 that coordinates the communication for these base stations. For position determination, base station controller 120 typically couples to a Position Determining Entity (PDE) 130 that receives time measurements from the remote terminals and provides control and other information related to position determination, as described in further detail below.<br>
[0034]	For position determination, remote terminal 106 measures the arrival<br>
times of the transmissions from a number of base stations 104. For a CDMA networic, these arrival times can be determined from the phases of the pseudo-noise (PN) codes used by the base stations to spread the signals prior to transmission to the remote terminal. The PN phases detected by the remote terminal are then reported to PDE 130 via (e.g., IS-801) signaling. PDE 130 then uses the reported PN phase measurements to determine pseudo-ranges, which are then used to determine the position of the remote . terminal.<br>
[0035]	The position of remote terminal 106 may be determined using a hybrid<br>
scheme whereby signal arrival times (i.e., times of arrival (TOA)) are measured for one or more base stations 104 and one or more Global Positioning System (GPS) satellites 124. The time measurements for the GPS satellites can be used as the primary measurements or to supplement the time measurements for the base stations. The time measurements for GPS satellites are typically more accurate than those from the base stations but require clear Une-of-sight to the satellites. Thus, the use of GPS may be limited to outdoor use where obstructions may not be present, and is typically not available for use indoors or in applications where there are obstructions such as foliage or buildings. However, GPS has extensive coverage and four or more GPS satellites can (potentially) be received from virtually anywhere.<br>
[0036]	In contrast, base stations are typically located in populated areas but<br>
their signals are able to penetrate some buildings and obstructions. Thus, the base stations may be advantageously used to determine position within cities, and (potentially) within buildings. However, the time measurements for the base stations are typically less accurate because multiple signals may be received at ihe remote terminal from a particular base station due to multipath.<br><br>
[0037]	In the hybrid scheme, each base station and each GPS satellite represents<br>
a transmission node. To determine the position of the remote terminal, transmissions from three or more non-spatially aligned nodes (base stations and/or satellites) are processed. A. fourth node may be used to provide altitude and may also provide increased accuracy (i.e., reduced uncertainty in the measured arrival times). The signal arrival times can be determined for the transmission nodes and used to compote pseudo-ranges, which can then be used (e.g., via a trilateration technique) to determine the position of the remote terminal. Position determination can be achieved in accordance with the techniques described in the aforementioned 3GPP 25.305, TIA/EIA/B-801, and TIA/EIA/IS-817 standard documents and in US Patent Application Serial No. 09/430,618.<br>
[0038]	In accordance with an aspect of the invention, remote terminal 106<br>
detects the signal arrival times for base stations 104 and reports the time measurements to PDE 130. PDE 130 in turn uses the measurements to determine an initial estimate of the possible positions of remote tenninal 106 and may further instruct the remote terminal to use a set of time windows to search for transmissions from a set of GPS satellites 124. The search windows are determined by PDE 130 based on the measurements from remote terminal 106 and possibly from additional information available to the PDE. Generation of the search windows is described in further detail, below.<br>
[0039]	Each GPS satellite 124 continually transmits a message that includes the<br>
time at which the message was transmitted. The message is spread with a pseudo-noise<br>
(PN) code having a specific length and offset assigned to the GPS satellite. The remote<br>
terminal receives the GPS transmission, despreads the received signal with the same PN<br>
code, but at various time offsets within a particular range defined by die search<br>
window, and recovers the message. The PN offset used by the remote terminal to<br>
recover the GPS transmission is indicative of the time difference between the GPS<br>
satellite and the remote terminal, and is also indicative of the signal arrival time.<br>
[0040]	The remote terminal typically searches within a particular search<br>
window (i.e., a particular range of PN offsets) in an attempt to recover the GPS transmission. A larger search window translates to longer search time, which may be used to ensure that a GPS transmission in a wider range of time offsets can be found by the remote terminal.   Alternatively, a smaller search window translates to a shorter<br><br>
search time, which is more desirable, but requires additional information to indicate that<br>
the GPS transmission is likely to be found within that smaller range of time offsets.<br>
[0041]	In the example shown in FIG. 1, remote tenninal 106 may receive<br>
transmissions from GPS satellites 124a through 124c, base stations 104b and 104c (and<br>
S possibly base station 104a), and repeater 114. Remote terminal 106 measures the signal arrival times of the transmissions from the satellites, base stations, and repeater, and reports these time measurements to PDE130 via BSC120.<br>
[0042]	As noted above, repeaters can be used to provide coverage for regions<br>
not covered by the base stations. Repeaters are more cost effective man base stations,<br>
1 and can be advantageously deployed where additional capacity is not required (e.g., in rural areas). However, a repeater is associated with additional delays due to (1) circuitry within the repeater and (2) cabling and/or additional transmission associated with the repeater. As an example, surface acoustic wave (SAW) filters, amplifiers, and other components within the repeater introduce additional delays that are comparable to, or may be even greater than, the transmission delays from the base station to the remote terminal.<br>
[0043]	FIG. 2A is a diagram showing the possible positions of a remote<br>
terminal based on a transmission received from a base station that does not employ a repeater. The arrival time of a transmission from the base station can be measured and translated into a range RBT* which is represented by a circle 212 around the base station. The remote terminal can be located anywhere along circle 212 if no additional information is available for the remote terminal.<br>
[0044]	FIG. 2B is a diagram showing the possible positions of a remote terminal<br>
based on a time measurement for a cell that employs a repeater (also referred to herein as a "repeated cell"). In such a repeated cell, additional uncertainty in the position of the remote terminal is introduced by (1) the use of the repeater with the cell and (2) the additional delays associated with the repeater.  The uncertainty due to each of these<br>
factors is described below.<br>
[0045]	To illustrate the uncertainty in the remote terminal's position due to the<br>
use of a repeater with a cell, an assumption can be made that no additional delays are introduced by the repeater. The signal arrival time measured at the remote tenninal can be translated into a range RBT- This range represents the range RBR from the base station to the repeater plus the range RRT from the repeater to the remote terminal (i.e..<br><br>
RBT = RBR + RRT)- The remote terminal may thus be located from (RBa - ROT) to (RBR +<br>
RRT) radially from the base station, which is represented by circles 214a and 214b,<br>
respectively. Again, if no additional information is available, the remote terminal may<br>
be located anywhere within an area 216a defined by circles 214a and 214b.<br>
[00461	The   additional  delays   introduced  by  the   repeater increases  the<br>
uncertainty of the remote tenninal's position. The additional repeater delays can be<br>
translated into a range RR, which is added to the range RBT to obtain the total range<br>
RBRT <i.e. the range corresponding to signal arrival time from base station></i.e.>
remote terminal with the repeater delays). This total range RBKT is represented by a<br>
circle 214c in FIG. 2B. As shown in HG. 2B, due to the uncertainty resulting from the<br>
use of the repeater with the cell and the additional delays introduced by the repeater (if<br>
the delays are not known), the remote terminal may be located anywhere within areas<br>
216a and 216b based on the time measurement from the terminal.<br>
[0047]	The invention provides various techniques to detect whether a remote<br>
terminal is under the coverage of a repeater within a network so that the processing to<br>
estimate the remote terminal's position can account for the additional ambiguity<br>
typically associated with the repeater. In accordance with various aspects of the<br>
invention, a determination of whether the remote terminal is under the coverage of a<br>
repeater may be achieved based on (1) a list of base stations expected to be received<br>
while under the coverage of the repeater (i.e., a probable neighbor list) versus a list of<br>
base stations actually received by the remote terminal, (2) the characterized<br>
environment of the repeater, (3) the propagation delays for a transmission received at<br>
the remote terminal, (4) some other criteria, or (5) a combination thereof.<br>
[0048]	The invention further provides techniques to account and/or compensate<br>
for the additional ambiguity resulting from being under the coverage of a repeater. In one aspect, time measurements from repeated base stations may be discarded and not used to estimate the remote tenninal's position. In another aspect, the processing to estimate the remote terminal's position may be adjusted to account for the additional ambiguity (e.g., a search window may be widened). In yet another aspect, multiple transmissions received from the same originating base station may be used to compute a series of position estimates for the remote terminal, and the most likely estimate is selected. For a CDMA network, an originating base station is one assigned to a specific PN offset. And in yet another aspect, multiple transmissions from multiple originating<br><br>
base stations may be used to compute a series of position estimates for the remote terminal, and again the most likely estimate is selected.<br>
[0049]	The techniques described herein may be used to more accurately<br>
determine the position of the remote terminal by talcing into account the sources for the time measurements and any additional information available for the base station and repeaters. Various aspects, embodiments, and features of the invention are described in further detail below.<br>
Detection of Repeater Based on Probable Neighbor I .fat<br>
[0050]	An aspect of the invention provides a technique to detect whether a<br>
remote terminal is under the coverage of a repeater based on probable neighbor lists formed for the repeaters in the network. In a typical wireless network, the coverage pattern is such that a remote terminal located anywhere within the network is likely to receive signals from a number of transmission sources (i.e., base stations and/or repeaters). This information can be cataloged and used to determine whether the remote terminal is under the coverage of a repeater.<br>
[0051]	FIG. 3 is a diagram illustrating a network 300 that includes a number of<br>
(hexagonal) cells, some of which include repeaters. Depending on the particular location of a remote terminal within network 300, the remote terminal may detect signals (e.g., pilots) from a large number of base stations (e.g., up to 20 base stations). The base stations that may be received by the remote terminal are dependent on the particular location of the remote terminal within the network. For example, a remote terminal 106x under the coverage of a repeater 114x is likely to receive signals from a different set of base stations than a remote terminal 106y under the coverage of a base station 104y. In an embodiment, the possible base stations that may be received while under the coverage of a particular repeater axe placed in a probable neighbor list for that<br>
repeater.<br>
[0052]	As noted above, a repeater is typically employed to solve coverage<br>
problem. For example, a repeater may be employed to cover a region (hole) in the network that may be "shadowed" out. Such regions may include, for example, mountains, tunnels, shopping malls, and so on. A repeater may also be used to extend coverage to a new area that cannot be reached by an existing base station. Thus, the probable neighbor list for each repeater is likely to be different from those of other<br><br>
repeaters in the network and would be a subset of the base stations surrounding the base " station that is repeated.<br>
[0053]	In an embodiment, die base stations and repeaters within the network are<br>
characterized. This characterization may entail determining the layout of the network, the locations of each base station and repeater within the network, and so on. Additionally, measurements may be made by remote terminals at various locations within the entire network to collect information as to which base stations may be detected in that coverage area. This information can be used to generate a probable neighbor list for the repeater. The process can be performed for each repeater within the network.<br>
[0054]	The information for a repeater can be collected by measurements made<br>
when the repeater is initially deployed. Alternatively, this information can be "learned" from the remote terminal, when operated under the coverage of the repeater, during normal operation. The PDE can generate and maintain the probable neighbor lists for all repeaters located within the network.<br>
[0055]	Thereafter, if the PDE suspects that a particular remote terminal is under<br>
the coverage of a repeater, it can verify this by comparing the sources of the time<br>
measurements received from the remote terminal against the probable neighbor lists<br>
maintained for the repeaters. The PDE may assign a particular degree of confidence in<br>
its assessment of whether the remote terminal is under a particular repeater's coverage.<br>
[0056]	FIG. 4 is a flow diagram of an embodiment of a process 400 for<br>
determining whether a remote terminal is under the coverage of a repeater by using the repeater's probable neighbor list Initially, the PDE receives time measurements from the remote terminal, at step 412. Based on any one of a number of techniques (some of which are described below), the PDE may suspect that the remote terminal is under the coverage of a repeater, at step 414. This suspicion may be derived, for example, based on the received time measurements (e.g., if excessive delays are detected in any one of the time measurements). If the remote terminal is not suspected to be under a repeater's coverage, the search windows for the remote terminal are generated in the normal manner (i.e., without compensating for repeaters), at step 416.<br>
[0057]	Otherwise, if the remote terminal is suspected to be under a repeater's<br>
coverage, the list of base stations from which the time measurements were obtained is determined, at step 418. This list of received base stations may also be generated by the<br><br>
PDE at step 412 for the time measurements received from the remote terminal. The list<br>
of received base stations is then compared against the probable neighbor list for the<br>
repeater under which the remote terminal is suspected to be covered, at step 420.<br>
[0058]	Based on the result of the comparison in step 420, a determination is<br>
made whether the remote terminal is under the repeater's coverage, at step 422. If the answer is no, the search windows for the remote terminal are generated in the normal manner, at step 416. Otherwise, if the remote terminal is deemed to be under the repeater's coverage, the search windows are generated in a manner to account for the additional ambiguity resulting from being under the repeater's coverage, at step 424. For example, the search windows may be widened and/or shifted depending on the detected delays. The process then terminates.<br>
Detection of Repeater Based on Environmental Information<br>
[0059]	An aspect of the invention provides a technique to detect whether a<br>
remote terminal is under the coverage of a repeater based on environmental information<br>
collected for repeaters within the network. In an embodiment, the PDE "catalogs" the<br>
environment types for some or all repeaters in the network, with the environment types<br>
being descriptive of the repeater's coverage. This cataloged infonnation is thereafter<br>
used to determine whether a remote terminal is under the coverage of a repeater.<br>
[0060]	FIG. 5 is a diagram illustrating an example network 500 in which the<br>
cataloged environment types of the repeaters may be used to determine whether a<br>
remote terminal is under the coverage of a repeater. In this example, three base stations<br>
104a through 104c provide coverage for a portion of the network. Base station 104a is<br>
coupled to two repeaters 114e and 114f used to provide coverage for a tunnel 512.<br>
Because of obstruction, remote terminal 106a within a portion of the tunnel is only able<br>
to receive the signal from base station 104a (via repeater 114e and/or 114f) while the<br>
signals from base station 104b and (to a large extent) base station 104c cannot be<br>
received by the terminal. Another terminal 106b located outside, and not obstructed by,<br>
the tunnel is able to receive the signals from all three base stations, as shown in FIG. 5.<br>
[0061]	In an embodiment, the PDE can note the environment types for the<br>
repeaters. In the example shown in FIG. 5, the PDE can note that repeaters 114e and 114f are located within a tunnel and that the obstruction caused by the tunnel would likely block the signals from other base stations.  Thus, if the PDE receives only one<br><br>
time measurement from a remote terminal (e.g., remote terminal 106a) determined to be located in the area between base stations 104a, 104b, and 104c, the PDE can deduce that the time measurement is from a repeater (e.g., repeater 114e or 114f)-Correspondingly, if the PDE receives a number of time measurements for a number of base stations from a remote terminal (e.g., remote terminal 106b) determined to be located near the same area, the PDE can deduce that the remote terminal is not under the coverage of repeater 114e or 114f. Thus, the cataloged environment type of the repeater's coverage can be used to determine whether or not the remote terminal is under the coverage of a repeater.<br>
[0062]	In an embodiment, the environment type of a repeater may be cataloged<br>
by the type of fading and path loss encountered in the repeater. For example, signals in an urban area generally do not degrade in the same way as they do in a rural or suburban area. Such information may be used to determine which repeater solution to proceed. As an example, in a tunnel, the base station signals will be very weak and the GPS signals are almost undetectable. So if it is concluded from the remote terminal's readings that it is located in a tunnel, men that provides some information as to the remote terminal's position. Also if the particular tunnel is repeated, then proper adjustments can be made on the measurements to determine the position of the remote terminal.<br>
[0063]	In a rural area, the signals have relatively better path loss (i.e., they do<br>
not degrade as much with distance). If it is known how a signal degrades in whatever medium it propagates, the path distance traveled by the signal may be determined. If that distance is deemed much greater than the separation of the remote terminal and base station, the difference can be due to repeaters and accounted for when calculating<br>
position.<br>
[0064]	In an embodiment, the environment type of a repeater is defined with the<br>
use of a neighbor list for each repeater. For the example shown in FIG. 5, a terminal under the coverage of repeater 114e is likely to be able to receive only the signal from base station 104a and unlikely to receive the signals from base stations 104b and 104c. Thus, the neighbor list for repeater 114e is empty. However, a terminal under the coverage of repeater 114f may also receive the signal from base station 104c, and the neighbor list for repeater 114f accordingly reflects this (e.g., as shown in Table 1). The neighbor list for base stations 104a may include base stations 104b and 104c, the<br><br>
neighbor list for base station 104b may include base stations 104a and 104c, and the neighbor list for base station 104c may include base stations 104a and 104b. [0065] Table 1 lists the transmission sources for the example shown in FIG. 5 and their neighbor lists.<br>
Table 1<br><br>
Transmission Source	Repeater Employed	Neighbor List<br>
Base station 104a	Yes	Base stations 104b and 104c<br>
Repeater H4e	-	Empty<br>
Repeater 114f	-	Base station 104c<br>
Base station 104b	No	Base stations 104a and 104c<br>
Base station 104c	No	Base stations 104a and 104b<br>
[0066]	FIG. 5 shows a specific example of the cataloging of the environment<br>
type to determine the transmission source of a time measurement. Other examples can be provided for other environments, for example, downtown, rural areas, shopping malls, indoors, and so on. For example, referring back to FIG. 1, a remote terminal under the coverage of either repeater 112b or 112c may not receive signals from as many other base stations as a remote terminal located under the coverage of base station 104a, 104b, or 104c.<br>
Detection of Repeater Based on Time of Arrival CTOA) or Round Trip Delay<br>
[0067]	An aspect of the invention provides a technique to detect whether a<br>
remote terminal is under the coverage of a repeater based on the time measurements from the remote terminal. This technique exploits known or estimated delays associated with a transmission from a repeater to a remote terminal and known or estimated delays typically associated with the repeater itself to determine whether or not the remote terminal is under the coverage of the repeater. This technique may be used for various network configurations, and is especially applicable for a network configuration in which repeaters are used to extend the coverage of the network, such as repeaters 114b and 114c in FIG. 1.<br><br>
[0068]	In an embodiment, the timing of the system may be calibrated. For a<br>
base station, the time difference between system time and the timing of the base station's transmission may be determined. And for a repeater, the measured delay between the receive and transmit paths of the repeaters may also be determined. These time measurements may be used to detect whether or not the remote terminal is under a repeater's coverage, as described in further detail below.<br>
[00(9]	FIG. 6A is a diagram of a transmission from a base station 104 to a<br>
remote terminal 106 whereby no repeaters are employed. As shown in FIG. 6A, the signal from base station 104 can reach remote terminal 106, via a direct line of sight path 610a, or a reflected path 610b after bouncing from a reflection source 612. Each transmission path is associated with a corresponding propagation delay (e.g., TBTI and Trn, as shown in FIG. 6A).<br>
[0070]	FIG. 6B is a diagram of a transmission from base station 104 to remote<br>
terminal 106 via repeater 114. In this example, remote terminal 106 is under the coverage of repeater 114 and, because of an obstruction or some other reason, is not able to receive a direct transmission from base station 104 (the received transmission from base station 104 may be weak). As shown in FIG. 6B, the signal is first transmitted from base station 104 to repeater 114 via a wireless or wireline link 612a, conditioned by repeater 114, and transmitted to remote terminal 106. The additional delays TR introduced by the circuits within repeater 114 increases the overall propagation delays of the signal. Moreover, if the repeater is located further away from the base station than the remote terminal (as shown in FIG. 6B), the signal experiences longer propagation delays because of the longer distance to the repeater and then back to the remote terminal, as illustrated in FIG. 6B.<br>
[0071]	For FIG. 6A, the worst case propagation delays for the transmission<br>
from base station 104 to remote terminal 106 can be determined as the delays TBR2 associated with reflected path 610b. And for FIG. 6B, the best-case propagation delays TBRT for the transmission from base station 104 to remote terminal 106 is dependent on the delays TBR from the base station to the repeater, the delays TR introduced by the repeater, and the delays TRT from the repeater to the remote terminal (i.e., TBRT = TBR + TR + TRT). If there is a time difference (i.e., a gap) between the worst case propagation delays TBR2 for a transmission from the base station and the best case propagation delays TBRT for a transmission from the repeater, then a threshold value can be selected<br><br>
to determine whether the remote terminal is under the coverage of the base station or the repeater. The threshold value can be selected based on the following-.<br>
where TE^^tation is the worst case propagation delays for a transmission received from<br>
the base station (Tim), T-m is the threshold value, and TRBpeilter is the best-case<br>
propagation delays for a transmission received from the repeater (TBRT)-<br>
[0072]	Once the threshold value for a repeated base station is selected, the PDE<br>
can thereafter compare a time measurement received from the remote terminal for that repeated base station to the threshold value. If the propagation delays indicated by the time measurement is greater than the threshold value, the PDE can deem that the time measurement is for the repeater. Otherwise, if the propagation delays indicated by the time measurement is less than the threshold value, the PDE can deem that the time measurement is for the base station.<br>
[0073]	Equation (1) assumes that the worst-case propagation delays for the base<br>
station is less than the best-case propagation delays for the repeater (i.e., TB«e_satioo  TRepenKf), a threshold value can be selected within the range of the overlap to achieve a high likelihood of correctly detecting whether the remote terminal is under die coverage of the base station or die repeater.<br>
[0074]	FIG. 7 is a flow diagram of an embodiment of a process 700 to<br>
determine whether a remote terminal is under the coverage of a base station or a<br>
repeater based on propagation delays. Initially, the PDE receives a time measurement<br>
from the remote terminal, at step 710. The PDE then determines the propagation delays<br>
(i.e., the one-way delay) of the transmission from the originating base station to the<br>
remote terminal based on the received time measurement, at step 712. Alternatively,<br>
the PDE may determine a round trip delays (RTD) estimate of a transmission from the<br>
base station to the remote terminal and then back to the base station. This RTD<br>
estimate would be approximately twice the one-way delays from the base station to the<br>
remote terminal. The one-way delays estimate is indicative of the transmission delays<br>
from the base station (possibly through one or more repeaters) to the remote terminal.<br>
[0075]	At step 714, a determination is made whether the one-way delays (or<br>
RTD) estimate is less than a threshold value that has been selected for the base station based on the factors described above.  If the one-way delays estimate is less than the<br><br>
threshold value, the remote terminal is deemed to be under the coverage of the base station and position determination for the remote terminal is performed without considering the additional ambiguity associated with repeaters. Thus, the search windows for the remote terminal can be generated in the normal manner, at step 716. Otherwise, if the one-way delays estimate is greater than ox equal to the threshold value, the remote terminal is deemed to be under the coverage of the repeater and position determination for the remote terminal is performed taking into account the additional ambiguity associated with the repeater. In this case, the search windows for the remote terminal can be generated to account for the repeater, at step 718. The process then terminates.<br>
Position Determination Based on Selective Measurements<br>
[0076]	In accordance with an aspect of the invention, position determination for<br>
a remote terminal is performed based on selected ones of the time measurements received from a remote terminal. As described above with respect to FIGS. 2A and 2B, the mere use of a repeater and also the additional delays associated with the repeater result in additional ambiguity in the position of the remote terminal. Because of this additional uncertainty, the time measurement for a cell employing a repeater may not be helpful in detennining the position of the remote terminal. Thus, in accordance with this aspect of the invention, a time measurement for a repeated base station is not used to determine the position of the remote terminal.<br>
[0077]	Referring back to FIG. 1, remote terminal 106 is located within coverage<br>
area 112a of repeater 114a and may receive a transmission from base station 104a or<br>
repeater 114a, or both, depending on various factors such as the communication link,<br>
fading conditions, and so on. Thus, there may be uncertainty as to the actual source of<br>
the transmission received by remote terminal 106 for cell 1, which may be either base<br>
station 104a or repeater 114a. Since the source of the transmission is unclear, there<br>
may be greater uncertainty in the estimated position of a remote terminal located in a<br>
cell that employs a repeater, as described in further detail below.<br>
[0078]	The estimated position of a remote terminal may be less accurate if a<br>
time measurement for a repeated base station is erroneously equated to a wrong source than if that time measurement was not used at all for position determination. As an example, if the time measurement received for repeater 114a is erroneously equated as<br><br>
being for base station 104a, then remote terminal 106 may be erroneously estimated as being further from the base station than in actuality. The amount of error is related to the amount of additional delays introduced by the repeater. Alternatively, if the time measurement received for base station 104a is erroneously equated as being for repeater 114a, then remote terminal 106 will be erroneously estimated as being closer to the base station than in actuality.<br>
[0079]	m an embodiment, the PDE maintains a list of base stations for which it<br>
may receive time measurements and, for each base station in the list, an indication of whether repeaters are employed with the base station. Table 2 is an example of a list maintained by the PDE for the network layout shown in FIG. 1.<br>
Table 2<br><br>
Cells	Repeater Employed<br>
Base station 104a	Yes<br>
Base station 104b	Yes<br>
Base station 104c	No<br>
[0080]	For each time measurement reported by the remote terminal, the PDE<br>
determines the base station for which the time measurement is associated (i.e., the base station originating the transmission from which the time measurement was derived). The PDE then consults the table to determine whether the time measurement is associated with a base station that employs a repeater (i.e., a repeated base station). If the table indicates that the originating base station is a repeated base station, the PDE can elect to omit this time measurement from being considered in the position determination processing. In this case, the PDE would estimate the position of the remote terminal and/or compute the search windows for the remote terminal based on time measurements for base station not associated with repeaters (i.e., non-repeated base stations).<br>
[0081]	Alternatively, the PDE can elect to consider this time measurement<br>
associated with a repeated base station in the position determination processing. The PDE would then determine the position of the remote terminal and/or compute the<br><br>
search windows for the remote terminal taking into account the ambiguity introduced by the repeaters.<br>
[0082]	FIG. 8A is a diagram illustrating the estimated position for a remote<br>
terminal with the time measurements for repeated base stations discarded. FIG. 8A corresponds generally to the example network shown in FIG. 1. Initially, remote terminal 106 receives transmissions originating from base stations 104a, 104b, and 104c, and reports the time measurements to PDE 130. PDE 130 consults a table and recognizes that base stations 104a and 104b employ repeaters and that base station 104c does not employ a repeater. Thus, PDE 130 may discard the time measurements for base stations 104a and 104b, and only considers the time measurement for base station 104c. The estimated position for remote terminal 106 would then be a dotted circle 812 having a radius defined by the propagation delays between base station 104c and remote terminal 106. The search windows for the GPS satellites are then generated by PDE 130 based on this initial position estimate.<br>
[0083]	FIG. 8B is a diagram illustrating the estimated position for remote<br>
terminal 106 with the time measurement for a repeated base station considered Again,<br>
FIG. 8B corresponds generally to the example network shown in FIG. 1. However, the<br>
time measurement for base stations 104a is also used to estimate the position of remote<br>
terminal 106. In this case, the remote terminal's position would be the intersection of a<br>
shaded area 816 associated with base station 104a and dotted circle 812 associated with<br>
base station 104c. Again, the search windows for the GPS satellites are generated by<br>
PDE 130 based on the hutia] estimated position of the remote terminal.<br>
[0084]	As described above in FIG. 2B, shaded area 816 results from the<br>
uncertainty associated with the deployment of repeater 114. Depending on the<br>
additional delays introduced by repeater 114, shaded area 816 may be much larger than<br>
that shown in FIG. 8B, and may encompass the entire coverage area of base station<br>
104c. In that case, the use of the time measurement for base station 104a may result in<br>
more uncertainty than simply omitting this time measurement<br>
[0085]	FIG. 9 is a flow diagram of an embodiment of a process 900 for<br>
estimating position of a remote terminal based on selective time measurements received from the terminal. Initially, the PDE receives the time measurements from the remote terminal, at step 912. The PDE men determines whether any of the received time measurements is for a base station that is repeated, at step 914. This determination can<br><br>
be achieved by identifying the base station associate with each time measurement and<br>
consulting a table (such as Table 2) to determine whether the base station is associated<br>
with a repeater.  If none of the time measurements are for a repeated base station, the<br>
PDE retains all received time measurements, at step 916, and proceeds to step 940.<br>
[0086]	At step 914, if any received time measurement is for a repeated base<br>
station, a determination is made whether or not any of the repeated base stations is the reference base station, at step 918. If none of the repeated base stations is the reference base station, the time measurements for the repeated base stations are discarded, at step 920. The process then proceeds to step 940.<br>
[0087]	The reference base station is the base station from which the remote<br>
terminal derives its timing. Position is computed by determining the difference in the arrival times of signals from other base stations (i.e., the difference in time between the arriving paths from the reference base station and other base stations). For positioning determination purposes, any reasonably strong received base station may be the reference base station.<br>
[0088]	At step 918, if the reference base station is determined to be a repeated<br>
base station, a determination is made whether a non-repeated base station can be selected as the reference base station, at step 922. If the answer is yes, a non-repeated base station is selected as the reference base station, at step 924, and the time measurements for repeated base stations are discarded, at step 926. The PDE then determines an initial position estimate for the remote terminal and further generates search windows for the GPS satellites based on the retained time measurements, at step 940.<br>
[0089]	Back at step 922, if the time measurements are from repeated base<br>
stations and a non-repeated base station cannot be selected as the reference base station, the time measurements from the repeated base stations are retained, at step 928. The PDE then appropriately generates search windows to account for the additional ambiguity due to the repeaters.<br>
Generation of Search Windows to Account for Detected Presence of Repeaters<br>
[0090]	As noted above, the mere presence of repeaters in a network results in<br>
additional ambiguity in the estimated position of a remote terminal because it may not be known with certainty whether a transmission is received from a base station or its<br><br>
repeater. Moreover, additional delays introduced by the repeaters also results in<br>
additional ambiguity in the remote terminal's estimated position. For a base station that<br>
is not associated with a repeater, a remote terminal can be estimated as being located on<br>
a circle that surrounds the base station, with the radius of the circle being dependent on<br>
the propagation delays estimate from the base station, as shown in PIG. 2A. And for a<br>
base station that is associated with a repeater, the remote terminal can be estimated as<br>
being located on a circular region that surrounds the base station, with the size of the<br>
region being dependent on the coverage area of the repeater as well as the additional<br>
delays introduced by the repeater, as shown in FIG. 2B. The generation of a search<br>
window for a GPS satellite to account for the additional uncertainty in die estimated<br>
position of a remote terminal due to the use of repeater is described below.<br>
[0091]	FIG.   10A   is   a   two-dimensional   (2-D)   diagram  illustrating   the<br>
determination of a search window for a GPS satellite based on a time measurement received for a base station that does not employ a repeater. The time measurement is indicative of the propagation delays between the base station and the remote terminal and can be translated into a spatial range a, as shown in FIG. 10A. If no additional information is provided for the position of the remote terminal (e.g., no other time measurements are received for other base stations) then, in the worst case, the remote terminal may be located on either side of the base station by the distance a. The distance b between the GPS satellite and the base station can be determined in a manner known in the art<br>
[0092]	Using trigonometric calculations, the distance between the remote<br>
terminal and the GPS satellite can be computed as either c or d, depending on whether the remote terminal is located on the left or right side of the base station, respectively. The search window for this GPS satellite can be computed as a time window that is related to the difference between the distances c and d (i.e., search window « (c - d)). The time offset to the center of the search window is related to the distance b (i.e., time offset °e b). The remote terminal may be instructed to search for and acquire the transmission from the GPS satellite based on the search window at the determined time offset.<br>
[0093]	FIG.   10B   is   a  two-dimensional   (2-D)   diagram  illustrating   the<br>
determination of a search window for a remote terminal based on a time measurement received for a base station mat employs a repeater.   For this simple example, the<br><br>
repeater is assumed to introduce no additional delays. As shown in FIG. 10B, the propagation delays between the base station and the repeater is translated into a spatial range e, and the propagation time between the repeater and the remote tenainal is translated into a range r. If no additional information is provided for the location of the remote terminal, then in the worst case the remote terminal may be assumed to be located on either side of the base station within a range defined by the distances (e - r) and (e + r). The distance b between the GPS satellite and the base station can be determined in the manner known in the art.<br>
[0094]	Using trigonometric calculations, the distance between the remote<br>
terminal and the GPS satellite can be computed as either/ or g, depending on which<br>
side of the base station the remote terminal is located and assuming the remote terminal<br>
is located at the distance (e + r) from the base station. Similarly, the distance between<br>
me remote terminal and the GPS satellite is determined as either ft or i, again depending<br>
on which side of the base station the remote tenninal is located and assuming the<br>
remote tenninal is located at the distance (e - r) from the base station. The worst-case<br>
difference between these distances is (f - i), and die search window can be computed to<br>
be proportional to this worst case difference (i.e., search window « (f- i)),<br>
[0095)	As indicated in FIG. 2B, the additional delays introduced by a repeater<br>
further increase the ambiguity in the position of the remote tenninal. This additional<br>
ambiguity can be accounted for by increasing the search window for the GPS satellite<br>
by an amount related to the additional delays introduced by the repeater.<br>
{0096}	FIG. 11 is a flow diagram of an embodiment of a process 1100 for<br>
determining die position of a remote tenninal that takes into account transmissions<br>
received from repeaters. Initially, the PDE receives time measurements from a remote<br>
terminal, at step 1112. The PDE can then determine whether or not any of the received<br>
time measurements is for a repeated base station, at step 1114. The detection for<br>
repeaters can be achieved using any combination of the techniques described above. At<br>
step 1116, the PDE estimates the position of the remote terminal based on the received<br>
time measurements. The time measurements for repeated base stations may or may not<br>
be considered in estimating the remote terminal's position, as described above.<br>
[0097]	If one or more time measurements for repeated base stations are used to<br>
estimate the remote terminal's position, at step 1118, the PDE generates search windows for GPS satellites having enlarged sizes to account for the additional<br><br>
ambiguity in the estimated position due to repeaters, at step 1120. The search windows can be generated based on the technique described above. Otherwise, if none of the time measurements used to estimate the remote terminal's position are from a repeated base station, the search windows are generated in the normal manner, at step 1122. The PDE then instructs the remote terminal to search for GPS satellites using the generated search windows, at step 1124.<br>
Position Determination Using Multiple Ttane Measurements<br>
[0098]	In a typical cellular environment, a remote terminal receives multiple<br>
signals from a number of transmitting sources (i.e., base stations and/or repeaters). For<br>
a CDMA, system, these transmissions may be received and individually processed.<br>
[0099]	In accordance with an aspect of the invention, the position of the remote<br>
terminal is estimated based on a number of transmissions received at the terminal from a particular originating base stations. Each transmission is received at a particular signal level and associated with a particular propagation delays. The remote terminal can process the transmissions received from the base stations and repeaters and report some or all received transmissions (e.g., report transmissions having signal strengths above a particular threshold). The PDE can then use the time measurements for these reported transmissions to estimate the position of the remote terminal. The PDE may select and utilize the time measurements that result in the position estimate having the best confidence. If the PDE determines that the remote terminal is under the coverage of a repeater in the network, then the PDE may instruct the remote terminal to widen or shift the search windows.<br>
[00100]	FIG. 12A is a diagram showing multiple transmissions received by a<br>
remote tenninal from a base station and a repeater when the remote tenninal is under the coverage of the base station. In the example shown in FIG. 12A, remote terminal 106 receives a first transmission from base station 104a having propagation delays of TBTI and further receives a second transmission from repeater 114a having propagation delays of TRTi. The time measurements for the received transmissions are reported to the PDE, which can then determine the position of the remote terminal based on the reported time measurements.<br>
[00101]	For the example shown in FIG. 12A, since remote terminal 106 is not<br>
under the coverage of repeater 114a, the signal strength for the transmission received<br><br>
Tom the repeater is likely to be weak. And since remote terminal 106 is under the average of base station 104a, the signal strength for the transmission received from the sase station is likely to be stronger. A series of position fixes (i.e., position estimates) may be generated by the PDE for the remote terminal based on the received time measurements. The position fix having the best metric can be selected as the estimated position of the remote terminal.<br>
[00102]	Determination of the position of a remote terminal based on a number of<br>
time measurements for a number of transmissions from the same originating base<br>
station can be achieved, for example, in a manner described in U.S. Patent Application<br>
Serial No. (Attorney Docket No. PA99O504), entitled "METHOD AND APPARATUS<br>
FOR DETERMINING AN ALGEBRAIC SOLUTION TO GPS TERRESTRIAL<br>
HYBRID LOCATION SYSTEM EQUATIONS," filed xxx, assigned to the assignee of<br>
the present application and incorporated herein by reference. A root mean square error<br>
(RMSE) metric can be computed in a manner known in the art for each position fix<br>
based on the signal strength associated with each time of arrival (TOA) estimate.<br>
Weaker signal strength for a received muttipath corresponds to a higher likelihood that<br>
the signal has been bounced around. A transmission with weaker signal strength<br>
generally corresponds to greater ambiguity in a position fix computed based on this<br>
transmission and a correspondingly lower metric. Thus, the position fixes are usually<br>
associated with "residuals", which are representative of the uncertainty for the estimated<br>
position fixes. The computation of the metric is described in further detail in the<br>
aforementioned U.S. Patent Application Serial No. (Attorney Docket No. PA990504).<br>
[00103]	FIG. 12B is a diagram of another example of the transmissions received<br>
by a remote terminal from a base station and a repeater when the remote terminal is under the coverage of the repeater, hi the example shown in FIG. I2B, remote terminal 106 receives a first transmission from base station 104a having propagation delays of TBT2 and further receives a second transmission from repeater 114a having propagation delays of TRT2.<br>
[00104]	For the example shown in FIG. 12B, since remote terminal 106 is under<br>
the coverage of repeater 114a, the signal strength for the transmission received from the repeater is likely to be stronger than the transmission received from the base station. Again, a series of position fixes can be generated by the PDE for the remote terminal,<br><br>
and the position fix having the best metric can be selected as the estimated position of the remote terminal.<br>
[00105]	FIG. 13 is a flow diagram of an embodiment of a process 1300 for<br>
determining the position of a remote terminal based on multiple time measurements<br>
received for a repeated base station.   Initially, the PDE receives from the remote<br>
terminal a number of time measurements for one or more base stations, with multiple<br>
time measurements being received for at least one base station, at step 1312.<br>
[00106]	The PDE computes a series of position fixes based on the received time<br>
measurements and for various combinations of the multiple time measurements received for a particular base station, at step 1314.   Each computed position fix is ■ associated with a respective metric mat identifies a particular degree of confidence the computed position fix.<br>
[00107]	The position fix with the best metric is then selected as the estimated<br>
position of the remote terminal, at step 1316. For the selected position fix, a determination is then made whether or not the remote terminal is under the coverage of a repeater, at step 1318. If the answer is no, the search windows for the remote terminal are generated in the normal manner (i.e., without compensating for repeaters), at step 1320. Otherwise, if the remote terminal is estimated to be under the coverage of a repeater, the search windows are generated in a manner to account for the additional ambiguity associated with the repeater, at step 1322. This may entail widening and/or shifting the search windows depending on the delays, as described above. The process then terminates.<br>
Position Determination Using Cost Functions<br>
[00108]	In accordance with an aspect of the invention, a determination of<br>
whether or not a remote terminal is under the coverage of a repeater can be made by calibrating the base stations and repeaters in a network. In an embodiment, as part of the calibration, the PDE is provided with information on which base station is associated with one or more repeaters, the propagation delays between the base stations and their associated repeaters, the propagation delays between repeaters, and the additional delays introduced by each repeater. This information can be stored in a table maintained by the PDE.<br><br>
[00109]	Table 3 is an example of a table that may be maintained by the PDE for<br>
the delays associated with repeated base stations for the example network layout shown inFIG. 1. ITie first column lists the transmission source(i.e., abase station orrepeater) and the second column lists whether the base station is repeated. If the base station is repeated, the third column lists the propagation delays from the base station to the first repeater, or from one repeater to the next. And the fourth column lists the additional delays associated with the repeaters.<br>
Table 3<br><br>
Transmission Source	Repeater Employed	Propagation Delay	Repeater Delay<br>
Base station 104a	Yes	TBRI	<br>
Repeater 114a	-		TRI<br>
Base station 104b	No		<br>
Base station 104c	Yes	TfiR2	<br>
Repeater 114b	-	TBR3	Tm<br>
Repeater 114c	-		TR3<br>
[00110]	For position determination, the remote terminal receives transmissions<br>
from the base stations and repeaters in the network and reports to the PDE the time measurements for the received transmissions. In an embodiment, the remote terminal reports one time measurement for each originating base station (i.e., each unique PN offset in a CDMA network). This time measurement may be from a base station or a repeater of a repeated base station, and is typically derived from the earliest and strongest multipath from the transmission source.<br>
[00111]	The PDE receives from the remote terminal time measurements for a<br>
number of base stations (or their associated repeaters). In an embodiment, the PDE then estimates the position for the remote terminal based on the received time measurements and in accordance with a number of hypotheses. Each hypothesis is indicative of a particular guess as to the particular transmission source for each time measurement used to estimate the remote terminal's position.    For example, one<br><br>
hypothesis assumes that all received time measurements are from the base stations and not repeaters.<br>
[00112]	The remaining hypotheses are for various combinations of base stations<br>
and repeaters for the received time measurements. For each of these hypotheses, the lime measurement for each repeated base station is hypothesized to be for either the base station or a repeater. The time measurement for each hypothesized base station is men compensated by subtracting the delays associated with the transmission from the base station to the repeater and the additional delays introduced by the repeater. Each hypothesis results in one position fix and an associated error metric, which can be computed as described in the aforementioned U.S. Patent Application Serial No. (Attorney Docket No. PA990504). The PDE then selects the position fix having the best metric (i.e., smallest error). From this selected position fix, a determination can be made whether or not the remote terminal is under the coverage of a repeater based on the hypothesis.<br>
[00113]	FIG. 14 is a diagram of possible position fixes computed by the PDE for<br>
time measurements reported by a remote terminal in the network layout shown in FIG.<br>
1. In this example, the remote terminal reports time measurement for transmissions<br>
received from repeater 114a and base stations 104b and 104c. For this example, the<br>
time measurement from repeater 114a includes the propagation delays from base station<br>
104a to repeater 114a and the additional delays associated with repeater 114a. And the<br>
time measurements from base stations 104b and 104c are indicative of direct line-of-<br>
sight measurements. These time measurements are reported to the PDE.<br>
[00114]	Base on the calibration information such as that shown in Table 3, the<br>
PDE recognizes that base stations 104a and 104b are repeated base stations. For the first hypothesis, the PDE computes the position of the remote terminal assuming that all received time measurements are from the base stations (i.e., base stations 104a, 104b, and 104c). Because of the additional delays associated with repeater 114a, the estimated range from base station 104a is further away than actuality, and die remote terminal is estimated to be located at point HI.<br>
[00115]	For the next hypothesis, the time measurement for base station 104a is<br>
assumed to be from repeater 114a and the other time measurements are assumed to be from base stations 104b and 104c. The PDE then compensates the time measurement for repeater 114a with the delays stored in the table for base station 104a and repeater<br><br>
114a. In particular, the PDE subtracts the propagation delays TBR1 from base station 104a to repeater 114a and the additional delays TRI introduced by repeater 114a from the time measurement for repeater 114a. The estimated position of the remote terminal for this set of hypothesized time measurements is at point H2. Another hypothesis assumes that the time measurement for base station 104b is from repeater 114a. However, the measurement from base station 104b is associated with a low signal level, and this position fix is likely to be assigned a worse metric.<br>
fOOUK]	FIG. 15 is a flow diagram of an embodiment of a process 1500 for<br>
determining the position of a remote terminal based on multiple network hypotheses and cost functions. Initially, the PDE receives time measurements from a remote terminal, at step 1512. The PDE then determines whether any of the time measurements is for a repeated base station, at step 1514. If none of the time measurements are for repeated base stations, the PDE computes the position fix of the remote terminal based on the received time measurements, at step 1516, and generates search windows for the remote terminal in the normal manner, at step 1518. The process then terminates.<br>
[00117]	Otherwise, if any of the time measurements is determined to be for a<br>
repeated base station, at step 1514, the PDE computes a series of position fixes based on the received time measurements and for various network hypotheses, at step 1520. Each network hypothesis assumes a particular transmission source for the time measurement for each repeated base station (i.e., whether from the transmission source is the base station or repeater). The computed position fix for each hypothesis is associated with a respective metric that identifies a particular degree of confidence in the computed position fix. This metric can be based on the RMSE (root mean square error).<br>
[00118]	The position fix with the best metric is then selected as the estimated<br>
position of the remote terminal, at step 1522. For the selected position fix, a determination is then made whether the remote terminal is under the coverage of a repeater, at step 1524. If the answer is no, the search windows for the remote terminal are generated in the normal manner (i.e., without compensating for repeaters), at step 1518. Otherwise, if the remote terminal is estimated to be under the coverage of a repeater, the search windows are generated in a manner to account for the additional ambiguity associated with the repeater, at step 1524. This may entail widening and/or<br><br>
shifting the search windows depending on the delays, as described above. The process then terminates.<br>
System<br>
[00119]	FIG. 16 is a block diagram of an embodiment of remote terminal 106,<br>
which is capable of implementing various aspects of the invention. On the forward link, signals from the base stations and/or repeaters are received by an antenna 1612, routed through a duplexer 1614, and provided to an RF receiver unit 1622. RF receiver unit 1622 conditions (e.g., filters, amplifies, and downconverts) and digitizes the received signal to provide samples. A demodulator 1624 receives and processes (e.g., despreads, decovers, and pilot demodulates) the samples to provide recovered symbols. Demodulator 1624 may implement a rake receiver that processes multiple instances of the received signal and generates combined recovered symbols. A receive data processor 1626 then decodes the recovered symbols, checks the received frames, and provides the output data.<br>
[00120]	For position determination, the rake receiver may be operated to provide<br>
to a controller 1630 the arrival times for the strongest received multipaths or the<br>
multipaths having signal strengths that exceed a particular threshold level. For certain<br>
embodiments, the samples from RF receiver unit 1622 may also be provided to an RX<br>
signal quality measurement unit 1628 that measures the quality of the received<br>
transmissions. The signal quality measurement can be achieved using various<br>
techniques, including those described in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,056,109 and 5,265,119.<br>
[00121]	Controller 1630 receives the time measurements for the base stations and<br>
repeaters, the measured signal quality of the multipaths (for some embodiments), and a<br>
message indicative of the search windows sent by the PDE.  The time measurements<br>
and signal quality measurements are provided to a modulator 1644 for transmission<br>
back to the PDE, and the search windows are provided to a GPS receiver 1640.<br>
[00122]	GPS receiver 1640 receives and searches for GPS signals based on the<br>
search windows provided by controller 1630. The time measurements for the GPS satellites are then provided by GPS receiver 1640 to controller 1630, which then forwards the information to the PDE.<br>
[00123]	On the reverse link, data is processed (e.g., formatted, encoded) by a<br>
transmit (TX) data processor 1642, further processed (e.g., covered, spread) by a<br><br>
modulator (MOD) 1644, and conditioned (e.g., converted to analog signals, amplified,<br>
filtered, quadrature modulated, and so on) by an RF TX unit 1646 to generate a reverse<br>
link signal. The information from controller 1630 may be multiplexed with the<br>
processed data by modulator 1644. The reverse link signal is then routed through<br>
duplexer 1614 and transmitted via antenna 1612 to the base stations and/or repeaters.<br>
[00124]	PIG. 17 is a block diagram of an embodiment of PDE 130, which is<br>
capable of implementing various aspects of the invention.   PDE 130 interfaces with<br>
BSC 120 and exchanges information related to position determination.<br>
[00125]	On the reverse link, data from the base stations is provided via a<br>
transceiver 1714 to a RX data processor 1722. This data includes the time<br>
measurements and (possibly) the signal quality indications reported by the remote<br>
terminals, the time measurements for GPS satellites reported by the base stations, and<br>
other data. Data processor 1722 extracts the time measurements and signal quality<br>
indications from the received data and provides the information to a controller 1710.<br>
Controller 1710 may also receive additional data from a data storage unit 1730 (i.e.,<br>
information indicating whether a base station is repeated, the delays associated with the<br>
base stations and repeaters, and so on) and computes a position estimate for a remote<br>
terminal. Controller further computes search windows for the remote terminal based on<br>
available information. The search windows are provided to a TX data processor 1712,<br>
which properly formats and sends the data to the BSC via transceiver 1714.<br>
[00126}	The processing units described herein (e.g„ the rake receiver, data<br>
processors, controllers, and others) can be implemented in various manners. For example, each of these processing units can be implemented in an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), a digital signal processor, a microcontroller, a microprocessor, or other electronic circuits designed to perform the functions described herein. The processing units can also be integrated into one or more integrated circuits. Also, the processing units can be implemented with a general-purpose or specially designed processor operated to execute instruction codes that achieve the functions described herein.<br>
[00127]	Various aspects of the invention may also be implemented in software<br>
code executed on a processor. For example, the computation to estimate the position of the remote terminal based on time measurements from the remote terminal and to generate the search windows based on the estimated position of the remote terminal<br><br>
may be achieved by one or more software modules. Thus, at least some of the processing and computations described herein may be implemented using hardware, software, or a combination thereof.<br>
[00128]	For clarity, the position determination is described as being performed<br>
by the PDE. However, the processing to estimate position may also be performed at the base station, the remote terminal, or distributed between the PDE, base station, and remote terminal.<br>

of the invention. It is to be noted that the features described under these various section<br>
headings are not intended to be restricted to the section under which they are described,<br>
and techniques from two or more sections may be combined. For example, the<br>
determination of whether or not a remote terminal is under the coverage of a repeater<br>
may be made based on the probable neighbor list, the environment type of the repeater,<br>
the delays in the time measurements, the cost functions, or a combination thereof.<br>
