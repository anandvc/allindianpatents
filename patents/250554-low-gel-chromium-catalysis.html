3 MAR'<br>
" ' i<br>
The present invention discloses a method for reducing gel content in polymers<br>
prepared with chromium-based catalyst systems without reducing the throughput<br>
by using a double loop reactor.<br>
Polyethylene is known for use in the manufacture of a wide variety of articles. The<br>
polyethylene polymerisation process can be varied in a number of respects to<br>
produce a wide variety of resultant polyethylene resins having different physical<br>
properties which render the various resins suitable for use in different applications.<br>
In particular, it is known to use polyethylene for use in applications where the<br>
polyethylene is required to have crack resistance, both resistance to rapid and to<br>
slow crack growth. It is also known to use polyethylene in the manufacture of films<br>
where the polyethylene preferably has a low gel content.<br>
It is known in the art that the physical properties, in particular the mechanical<br>
properties, of a polyethylene product can vary depending on what catalytic system<br>
was employed to make the polyethylene. This is because different catalyst<br>
systems tend to yield different molecular weight distributions in the polyethylene<br>
produced.<br>
For example, EP-A-0829495, EP-A-946611 and EP-A-946612all disclose<br>
processes for producing polyethylene, these processes comprising copolymerising<br>
ethylene and an alpha-olefinic comonomer comprising from 3 to 8 carbon atoms, in<br>
the presence of a chromium-based catalyst in a first reactor to produce a first<br>
polyethylene copolymer product having a first melt index and a first molecular<br>
weight distribution, feeding the first polyethylene copolymer product thereby<br>
produced and the chromium-based catalyst to a second reactor, and in the second<br>
reactor copolymerising ethylene and an alpha-olefinic comonomer comprising from<br>
3 to 8 carbon atoms, in the presence of the chromium-based catalyst under<br>
different polymerisation conditions to produce a second polyethylene copolymer<br>
product having a second melt index and a second molecular weight distribution.<br><br>
in many prior art polymerisation processes, the amount of ge! is controlled at the<br>
expense of throughput higher residence time is resuiting in higher productivity anc<br>
lower gel content, at the expense of throughput<br>
In a single loop reactor, iow gel content can be obtained by reducing the<br>
throughput for given polymerisation conditions. Alternatively, the activity of the<br>
cataiyst system can be modified either by increasing the amount of<br>
triethyialuminium leading to resins having uncontrollable melt index, or by<br>
increasing the temperature, leading to resins having poor mechanical properties.<br>
It is an aim of the present invention to reduce the amount of gel in the final<br>
polyethylene.<br>
It is another aim of the present invention to retain the throughput in the<br>
polymerisation process.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for homopolymerising ethylene<br>
or for copolymerising ethylene and a comonomer in the presence of a chromium-based<br>
catalyst system in two serially connected loop reactors, wherein the operating conditions<br>
are substantially the same in both reactors to obtain a monomodal molecular weight<br>
distribution, to produce a final polyethylene resin at a productivity of less than 3500<br>
grams of polymer per gram of supported chromium-based catalyst component and thus at<br>
increased throughput said polyethylene resin being used to prepare films having an amount<br>
of geL defined by the portion of the film surface covered by gel expressed as part per million<br>
of surface covered with gel, of at most 30 part per million (pprn).<br>
The polymer fractions produced in each reactor are of the same nature: either they<br>
are both hamopoiymers or they are both copolymers. Preferably: they are<br>
copolymers. Preferably, the polyethylene is a copolymer of ethylene and the<br>
comonomer is an alpha-olefin having from 3 to 8 carbon atoms.<br>
The polyethylene resin can be used to prepare films having reduced gel content<br><br>
The productivity is less than 3500, preferably less than 2500 grams of polymer per<br>
gram of supported chromium-based catalyst component and the gel content is<br>
preferably of at most 30 ppm or of at most 600 per m2<br>
The chromium based catalyst component is not particularly limited and can be any<br>
chromium-based catalyst system disclosed in prior art such as for example the<br>
chromium-based catalyst component supported on a silica-titania support disclosed<br>
in EP-A-905145 or such as a chromium-based catalyst component supported on a<br>
silica support.<br>
Preferably the chromium-based catalyst comprises a supported chromium oxide<br>
catalyst having a titania-containing support, for example a composite silica and<br>
titania support. A particularly preferred chromium-based catalyst component may<br>
comprise from 0.5 to 5 wt% chromium, preferably around 1 wt% chromium, such as<br>
0.9 wt% chromium based on the weight of the chromium-containing catalyst. The<br>
support comprises at least 1 wt% titanium, preferably around 2 to 3 wt% titanium,<br>
more preferably around 2.3 wt% titanium based on the weight of the chromium<br>
containing catalyst. The chromium-based catalyst may have a specific surface<br>
area of from 200 to 700 m2/g, preferably from 400 to 550 m2/g and a pore volume of<br>
greater than 1.8 cc/g preferably from 2 to 3 cc/g.<br>
A particularly preferred chromium-based catalyst ("Catalyst 1") for use in the<br>
present invention comprises a catalyst which has an average pore radius of 190A,<br>
a pore volume of around 2.1 cc/g, a specific surface area of around 510 m2/g and a<br>
chromium content of around 0.9 wt% based on the weight of the chromium-<br>
containing catalyst. The support comprises a composite silica and titania support.<br>
The amount of titania in the support provides that the catalyst as a whole comprises<br>
around 2.3 wt% titanium.<br>
The catalyst may be subjected to an initial activation step in air at an elevated<br>
activation temperature. The activation temperature preferably ranges from 500 to<br>
850°C, more preferably 600 to 750 °C.<br><br>
In order to enhance the degree of comonomer incorporation into the polyethylene<br>
resin (thereby to lower the density of the resin), the catalyst preferably has a high<br>
surface area, preferably greater than 400m2/g, a large pore volume, preferably<br>
larger than 1.8 cc/g, and it may or may not be fiuorinated prior to activation. If it is<br>
fluorinated, it has a fluorine content of around 1 wt%.<br>
One or more organoaluminium compounds can be used as co-catalysts. An<br>
organoaluminium represented by the formula AIR3 can be used wherein each R is<br>
the same or different and is selected from halides or from alkoxy or alkyl groups<br>
having from 1 to 12 carbon atoms. Especially suitable aluminium alkyls are<br>
trialkylaluminium, the most employed being triethylaluminium (TEAL).<br>
In the first loop reactor, preferably ethylene monomer and an alpha-olefinic<br>
comonomer comprising from 3 to 8 carbon atoms are fed thereinto in the liquid<br>
phase, typically in an inert diluent, preferably isobutane, together with a chromium-<br>
based catalyst. Typically, the copolymerisation is performed at a temperature of<br>
from 90 to 105°C, more typically around 100 "C, and at a pressure of from 20 to 60<br>
bars, more typically around 42 bars. A diluent under supercritical conditions may<br>
also be employed in the polymerisation process, wherein the pressure of the<br>
supercritical diluent is of from 37 to 100 bars and the temperature of from 70 to 140<br>
°C.<br>
The comonomer preferably comprises 1-hexene, but may alternatively comprise<br>
any one or more of 1-butene, 1-pentene, 4-methyl-1-pentene, 1-heptene or 1-<br>
octene.<br>
Typically, the ethylene monomer comprises from 2 to 10% by weight and the<br>
comonomer comprises from 0.2 to 4% by weight, each based on the total weight of<br>
the monomer and comonomer in the inert diluent A typical polymerisation medium<br>
may for example comprise, in an inert diluent such as for example isobutane, an<br>
ethylene flow of from 2 to 10 wt%, and a 1-hexene flow of up to 4 wt%.<br><br>
In the first loop reactor, a first polyethylene resin is produced by copolymerisation of<br>
the ethylene and the comonomer. In accordance with the preferred process, in the<br>
first loop reactor the process variables such as the ethylene flow rate and the<br>
temperature are controlled so as to produce a polyethylene resin having a specified<br>
high load melt index (HLMI) yielding the required mechanical properties of the<br>
resin. Typically, the HLMI ranges from 5 to 35 g/10min, and is most typically from 8<br>
to 25 g/10min. The high load melt index is determined using the procedures of<br>
ASTM D1238 using a load of 21.6kg at a temperature of 190°C. The HLMI is<br>
broadly inversely indicative of the molecular weight of the polymer. In other words,<br>
a low melt index is indicative of a high molecular weight for the polyethylene, and<br>
vice versa. The amount of comonomer fed to the first reactor controls the density<br>
of the polyethylene fraction produced in said first reactor.<br>
The first polyethylene product, together with unreacted ethylene and comonomer in<br>
the inert diluent, is fed to the second loop reactor serially connected thereto and<br>
additional monomer (ethylene) and comonomer are fed into the second reactor.<br>
The same chromium-based catalyst is present in the second reactor as in the first<br>
reactor. In the second loop reactor, the process parameters are varied to produce<br>
therein a second polyethylene product having other properties. The properties.pf<br>
the first and second polyethylene resins are selected in order to obtain a final<br>
polyethylene resin that has the desired properties. The final polyethylene resin can<br>
have a monomodal or a broad or bimodal molecular weight distribution. The<br>
molecular weight distribution is defined by the polydispersity index D that is the<br>
ratio Mw/Mn of the weight average molecular weight Mw to the number average<br>
molecular weight Mn. In order to obtain a monomodal molecular weight distribution,<br>
the operating conditions are substantially the same in both reactors. A broad<br>
molecular weight distribution on the contrary requires different operating conditions<br>
in both reactors.<br>
The polyethylene products prepared according to the present invention are<br>
characterised by very low heterogeneity; They can be used to prepare films having<br>
a very low gel content. The gel content in a film is measured by the number of gels<br>
per m2 of film, or by the amount of gel defined as the portion of the film surface<br><br>
covered by gel expressed as part per million of surface covered with gel (ppm), and<br>
by the mean gel size. A small mean gel size is also observed. It is known in the art<br>
that the amount of gel decreases with increasing productivity. Typically low catalyst<br>
productivity is a consequence of low residence time. In order to increase the plant<br>
output, it is desired to reduce the residence time and therefore the productivity,<br>
thereby increasing the amount of gel, which is unavoidable in a single loop reactor<br>
The present invention provides a process whereby the amount of gel is<br>
substantially decreased even at low productivity and thus at high plant throughput,<br>
by using two serially connected loop reactors. This can be seen in Figure 1 that<br>
represents the amount of gel expressed in ppm as a function of productivity<br>
expressed in grams of polyethylene per gram of catalyst for a resin prepared in a<br>
double loop reactor, for a resin exiting the first reactor and for a prior art resin. It is<br>
observed on that Figure that, at equivalent productivity, the resins of the present<br>
invention have a significantly lower gel content than the prior art resins, at same<br>
productivity. The amount of gel contained in the final polyethylene film is at most 30<br>
ppm. More importantly, at same productivity, the amount of gel is substantially<br>
reduced.<br>
These polyethylene resins can be used to prepare films, fibres or bottles with low<br>
gel content.<br>
The low gel polyethylene resins of the present invention are suitable for preparing<br>
films.<br>
Figure 1 represents the amount of gel expressed in ppm as a function of<br>
productivity expressed in grams of polyethylene per gram of catalyst, for a resin<br>
prepared in a double loop reactor, for a resin exiting the first reactor and a prior art<br>
resin.<br>
Figure 2 represents a photograph of the gels in resin R1 retrieved respectively from<br>
the first (Figure 2a) and from the second reactor (Figure 2b).<br><br>
Figure 3 represents the gel size distribution for resin R1: it is the number cf counts<br>
as a function of size expressed in mm. The dashed line represents the resin exiting<br>
the first reactor and the solid line represents the resin exiting the second reactor.<br>
Figure 4 represents the gel size distribution for resin R2: if is the number of counts<br>
as a function of size expressed in mm. The dashed line represents the resin exiting<br>
the first reactor and the solid line represents the resin exiting the second reactor.<br>
Examples.<br>
The commercial catalyst Magnapore 963 produced by Grace Davison was<br>
fluorinated using NH4BF4 in order to contain 1 wt% of fluor. It was then activated by<br>
heating at a temperature of 635 "C. The cocatalyst was triethylaluminium (TEAL): it<br>
was introduced in the first reactor with the chromium-based catalyst in amounts<br>
specified in table I. No TEAL was added in the second reactor.<br>
Final resins R1 and R3 were prepared using the same conditions in both reactors:<br>
they had a monomodal polydispersity.<br>
Final resins R2 and R4 were prepared using different reactor conditions, targeting<br>
reduced hexene incorporation in the low molecular weight species produced in the<br>
first reactor. They had a broad polydispersity.<br>
The production conditions for resins R1 to R4 are summarised in Table I.<br><br><br><br><br>
Resin samples were retrieved from both the first reactor and the second reactor.<br>
They were extruded on a small laboratory extruder to form pellets and the pellets<br>
were then extruded to produce films having a thickness of 50 microns. The gels<br>
absorb more light than the polyethylene film and they are thus detected above an<br>
absorption threshold, high absorption threshold meaning high detection sensitivity.<br>
The gel level was determined by sending a beam of light through the film and by<br>
measuring the light transmitted through said film with a digital camera. The<br>
equipment used was as follows:<br>
-	The extruder to prepare the films was a Brabender E19/25D (table model)<br>
equipped with a 1.2 kW motor, a screw speed regulator of from 1 to 100<br>
rpm, and three zones for temperature control of 1300 W each.<br>
-	The light source was a halogen lamp DDL, cold light 150 W, 20 A equipped<br>
with an optical cross section converter.<br>
-	The camera was a digital linear camera having a line length of 2048 pixels,<br>
each pixel having a dimension of 14 microns x 14 microns, a dynamic range<br>
of 1000:1, a pixel frequency of 30 MHz, an inspection width of about 100 mm<br>
and a resolution of about 50 microns.<br>
-	The image-processing unit was an Intel 586/133 MHz processor with a<br>
memory of 16Mb RAM, a hard disk of 1.6 Gb, a graphic monitor VGA high<br>
resolution, 1024x768, low radiation, a capacity of 12,000,000 pixels/sec.<br>
The results are summarised in Table III.<br><br><br>
it is observed that the fraction of film surface covered with gel or amount of gel in<br>
the first reactor is about 10 times larger than in the second reactor. It is therefore<br>
concluded that the gels found in the first reactor are not merely diluted by the<br>
product made in the second reactor but that they are destroyed by the<br>
polymerisation occurring in the second reactor.<br>
Without wishing to be bound by a theory, it is believed that this result is typical of<br>
the resins produced with a chromium-based catalyst system. It is believed that the<br>
gels created in the first reactor are partly caused by poorly reacted catalyst grains<br>
that are in or have just ended their induction period before polymerisation. This can<br>
be seen in Figure 2 representing a photograph of the gels in resin R1 retrieved<br>
respectively from the first (Figure 2a) and from the second reactor (Figure 2b). One<br>
can see large catalyst residues in Figure 2a, appearing as the white comet-shaped<br>
marks below the gels represented as black spherical marks. On Figure 2b this<br>
phenomenon is significantly reduced for both the white comet-shaped marks and<br>
for the dark spherical marks.<br>
The gel size distribution is represented in Figure 3 for resin R1 and in Figure 4 for<br>
resin R2. Comparing these two figures, it was observed that the monomodal resin<br>
R1 had a smaller gel size in the second reactor than in the first reactor whereas<br>
that behaviour was not observed for the bimodal resin R2. The gels had the same<br>
size distribution in both reactors for resin R2, although the overall gel content was<br>
decreased.<br><br>
