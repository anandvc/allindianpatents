COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
(See Section 10 and Rule 13)<br>
METHOD AND KIT FOR REDUCING IRRITATION OF SKIN DEUPATORY COMPOSITIONS<br>
HINDUSTAN   LEVER   LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office at  Hindustan   Lever  House,      165/166,   Backbay   Reclamation, Mumbai -400 020, Maharashtra, India<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the<br>
manner in which it is to be performed.	 <br><br>
The invention concerns a method and kit for reducing irritation and other forms of skin damage often associated with depilation, particularly on sensitive skin.<br>
Depilatories are cosmetic composition which remove hair through chemical reaction by active agents.  Predominantly these agents sever disulfide bonds.  This weakens hair to such an extent that subsequent scraping and wiping away of the depilatory composition completes severance of hair at the skin surface and allows removal.<br>
Commercially the most common agents are thioglycolates, typically formulated at high pH.  Effectiveness requires prolonged residence time on the skin, generally for greater than four minutes.  These conditions for chemical reaction are relatively aggressive.  Significant irritation and inflammatory response can arise from the procedure, particularly experienced by those with sensitive skin.<br>
The art has tried to mitigate irritation attributable to chemical irritants.  For instance, U.S. Patent 6,13 9,850 (Hahn et al.) utilizes aqueous-soluble strontium salts as anti-irritants.  U.S. Patent 5,756,107 (Hahn et al.) identifies other alkali metal cations such as aqueous-soluble lithium or potassium salts as effective for the same purpose.<br><br>
Some patents describe depilatory formulations that reduce irritation by minimising contact time.  For example, GB 1 329 029 (Colgate-Palmolive) describes a self-heating depilatory in which the thioglycolic acid is packaged separately from the base.  Heat that is generated upon their combination speeds the depilation reaction.  Contact times are thereby shortened.<br>
WO 02/43682 Al (Kovacs et al.) discloses a product for shaving and depilation with benefits in softening hair, keeping the skin calmed and having a discrete scent.  These benefits are achieved through a homogenised product consisting of greasy oils, essential oils, antioxidant additives and preferably an essence of perfume.<br>
Another approach is disclosed in U.S. 6,306,380 Bl (Desmots et al.).  Cosmetic depilatory compositions are described with a continuous aqueous phase and an oil phase.  Partition of the keratin-degrading substance is formulated to distribute itself both in the aqueous and oil phases.  When the keratin-degrading substance in the continuous aqueous phase has been consumed/ the remainder in the oil phase becomes available in a regulated release, thereby resulting in a lower irritancy.<br>
None of the aforementioned approaches have been completely successful.  Further improvements are needed to achieve a depilatory both functionally effective and sufficiently mild for even sensitive skin.<br><br>
In a first aspect, there is provided a method for removing<br>
hair which includes:<br>
(i)     applying to an area of skin from which hair is to be removed a skin pre-treatment composition that includes a lipophilic material; and (ii)    applying onto the pre-treated area of skin a depilatory composition including a keratin degrading agent in an effective amount to chemically react with hair to allow wipe-away removal.<br>
Furthermore, there is provided a kit for removal of hair from an area of skin which includes:<br>
(a)	a skin pre-treatment product which includes:<br>
(i)   a skin pre-treatment composition that includes<br>
a lipophilic material; and (ii)  a carrier for delivering the skin pre-treatment<br>
composition onto the area of skin;<br>
(b)	a depilatory product which includes:<br>
(i)   a depilatory composition including a keratin degrading agent in an effective amount to chemically react with hair to allow removal; and<br>
(ii)  a carrier for delivering the depilatory<br>
composition onto the area of skin subsequent to delivery of the pre-treatment composition;<br>
(c)	instructions to apply the skin pre-treatment product<br>
to an area of skin requiring removal of hair followed<br>
by an application of the depilatory product over the<br>
area of skin covered by the pre-treatment product.<br><br>
Instructions normally will be in written form on packaging for the kit, on one or both of the pre-treatment and depilatory products, or on a separate written instruction insert within the kit package.<br>
Now it has been found that the irritation associated with chemical depilation of hair can be reduced or eliminated without loss of efficiency.  Pre-treatment of the depilation area with lipophilic materials significantly protects skin from redness/erythema.  Despite an underlying layer of the lipophilic material, chemical reaction by the keratin degrading actives remains unimpeded.  The desired hair removal is achieved without extending residence time of the actives.<br>
Lipophilic materials of the present invention are not limited, to but may preferably include oils such as hydrocarbons, natural or synthetic esters and silicones. Among the hydrocarbons suitable examples are mineral oil, isoparaffins, petroleum jelly (petrolatum), polymerized olefins (e.g. polybutenes, polydecenes, isohexadecane) and combinations thereof.<br>

Non-volatile silicone oils useful as an emollient material include polyalkyl siloxanes, polyalkylaryl siloxanes and polyether siloxane copolymers (e.g. dimethicone copolyol). The essentially non-volatile polyalkyl siloxanes useful herein include, for example, polydirnethyl siloxanes with viscosities of from about 5 to about 100,000 centistokes at 25°C.  Among the preferred non-volatile emollients useful in the present compositions are the polydirnethyl siloxanes having viscosities from about 10 to about 400 centistokes at 25°C.<br><br>
The lipophilic material may range in amount from 1 % to 100 % by weight of the skin pre-treatment composition, preferably in amounts from about 30 % to about 98 %, more preferably from about 60 % to about 90 % by weight of the skin pre-treatment composition.<br>

Illustrative accelerators include urea, thiourea, dimethyl isosorbide (DMI), ethoxydiglycol (Transcutol) or methyl propyl diol (MP diol).  Preferred are urea or methyl propyl diol.  These accelerators may be present in amounts from about 0.5 % to about 25 "%, preferably from about 1 % to about 12 %, optimally from about 5 % to about 10 % by weight of the depilatory composition.<br>
It is particularly preferred that the depilatory composition include a pH regulator.  The quantity and type of pH regulator should be chosen to maintain the pH at a value greater than 5, preferably greater than 7, more preferably in the range from about 8 to about 13, optimally in the range from about 11.5 to about 12.5, particularly about 12.<br>

The depilatory and sKin pretreatment compositions will be delivered by a carrier.  For purposes of this invention, the term "carrier" is. considered to be a mechanical water-insoluble rigid or flexible plastic or fibered device. Illustrative devices for use as carriers include jars, aerosol or mechanical spray pump devices, roll-on ball dispensers, propel-repel stick dispensers (similar to those used in antiperspiraflt sticks) and flexible woven or non-woven water-insoluble textiles.  When the carrier is a woven or non-woven flexible textile, this may be in the form of a glove or a single or multi-layered cloth.  The textile may be textured or non-textured.  It may be apertured or non-apertured.  One surface of the wipe may contain the depilatory composition, and the other the skin pre-treatment composition.<br>
The carrier may be a single or multi-compartment device. When the carrier is a single device, preferably it is a tube where each of the depilatory and skin compartment pre-treatment compositions remain separate from one another. Illustrative is a depilatory and skin pre-treatment composition each in the form of a semi-viscous material. Therein the compositions are arranged adjacent one another and extruded from the single tube package as two separate stripes.  Illustrative of this technology is U.S. Patent 4,211,341 (Weyn) herein incorporated by reference.<br><br>
Carriers for the respective depilatory and skin pre-treatment compositions may be in the form of dual-compartment dispensers.  Illustrative is a dual pump as shown in U.S. Patent 5,74 0,947 (Flaig et al.) herein incorporated by reference.  The carriers for each of the compartments may also be in the form of stackable jars such as disclosed in U.S. Patent 5,914,116 (Suares et al.) herein incorporated by reference.<br>
Carrier packages for the respective compositions may be different from one another.  For instance, there may be combinations of a roll-on dispenser with a jar, a textile with a roll-on dispenser, a textile with a jar, a spray noazle pump with a jar, a textile with a spray nozzle pump, a glove with a jar, a glove with a spray nozzle pump dispenser, or combinations thereof.<br>
Kits according to the present invention may constitute a combination of the aforementioned modes of packaging, with each of the respective packages containing one of the respective compositions.<br>
The depilatory and skin pre-treatment compositions may be applied from their respective carriers onto the skin requiring depilation in equal or unequal amounts.  The weight ratio of the applied respective compositions may range from about 100:1 to about 1:100, preferably from about 20:1 to about 1:20, and optimally from about 2:1 to about 1:2 by weight.<br><br>
Ordinarily the kits will be supplied with a set of instructions to first aPply the pre-treatment composition, and thereafter the depilation composition.  Instructions on time between the applications may also be provided. Dependent upon the particular compositions, there may be no watting time or as much as thirty                 between applications of the two different compositions.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Except in the operating and comparative examples, or where otherwise explicitly indicated, all numbers in this description indicating amounts of material ought to be understood as modified by the word "about".<br>
The term "comprising" is meant not to be limiting to any subsequently stated elements but rather to encompass non-specified elements of major or minor functional importance. In other words the lifted steps, elements or options need not be exhaustive.  whenever the words "including" or "having" are used, th^se terms are meant to be equivalent to "comprising", as defined above.<br>
The following examples will more fully illustrate the embodiments of this invention.  All parts, percentages and proportions referred to herein and in the appended claims are by weight unless otherwise illustrated.<br>
Example 1<br>
Eight panelists evaluated a commercially available depilatory composition alone and in combination with a pre-<br><br>
treatment composition of mineral oil.  The pre-treatment and non pre-treatment applications were applied to one each of the respective legs of every panelist.<br>
Each panelist on one of their legs spread mineral oil over the target depilation area, and left this on for five minutes.  Thereafter, the depilatory composition was spread over the pre-treatment area, and also on a non-pretreated area of the other leg.  After 10 minutes, both areas were rinsed with warm water to rinse-off the" depilatory composition"and mineral oil where present, and to remove severed hair.<br>
The depilation composition utilized for the test is a formulation reported in Table I below.<br>

Thioglycolic Acid	3.0<br>
Hydroxide Salt (Ca, Na, K)	4.2<br>
Mineral Oil	4.0<br>
Cetearyl Alcohol and Ceteareth-20	4.3<br>
Results of the test are reported in Table II below.  They reveal that efficacy was essentially the same with the pre-treatment and non pre-treatment regimes.  However, the pre-treatment regime was substantially preferred for having less irritation, leaving legs feeling smooth, leaving legs moisturised and was better in the application process.<br><br>

Example 2<br>
Theoretically separation of the depilation composition by the pre-treatment layer from the target skin should inhibit effectiveness of the keratin degrading agent.  However, the consumer panel test reported in Example 1 did not reveal any difference in hair removal effectiveness with or without the pre-treatment.<br>
A test in the form of a clinical was conducted to further evaluate efficacy.  Objective for the clinical was to explore what effect a mineral oil pre-treatment would have on the efficacy of a standard depilatory composition. Sixteen panelists were chosen for the study.<br>
Each panelist had two 5x5 cm sites marked on each outer lower leg.  Baseline evaluations (Charmview Videomicroscope) were made prior to product application.  Two of the four test sites were treated 5 minutes prior to product application with 0.04ml of mineral oil.  Then 1.Og of depilatory product was applied to each test site, and was exposed for 10 minutes.  Each test site was then wiped clean<br><br>
using a damp paper towel.  Readings were then taken thirty minutes after removal.<br>
The commercial product whose formula is identified in Table I was again utilized for this clinical.  Mineral oil was employed as the pre-treatment composition.<br>
Visual grading was conducted using a five-point scale for erythema; the scale ranges from 0 (none) to 4 (severe).  In addition, the Charmview Video microscope was utilized to measure redness on the forearms, and on the legs, and the images were analyzed to determine percent removal of hair. The analysis was done with Optimas Image Analysis software. Within each ROI ("Region of Interest") the hair fibers were threshold of density measured and at that threshold measured for pixel length.  The mean sum of hair fibers was then determined and compared post treatment to determine percent removal of hair.<br>
The percent decrease in mean hair length for the non-pretreated application was 88 %.  The pre-treatment application had a percent decrease in mean hair length of 77 %.  The difference between these mean hair length results was relatively small considering that the hair targets were first shielded with mineral oil, and were not expected to allow adequate penetration of the depilation composition.<br>
Example 3<br>
This Example illustrates use of a glove as a carrier for the skin pre-treatment composition in the context of the present<br><br><br>
invention.  A latex rubber glove is coated with mineral oil and sealed in a plastic pouch.<br>
When ready for use, the pouch is opened and the user places their hand in the glove with the oil coated surface on the outside.  The oil is then spread on the area of the leg and other body parts intended for the depilation.  After a five minute delay, a depilation composition held within a roll-on ball dispenser is applied over the mineral oil pre-treated skin.  After ten minutes, the pre-treatment and depilation compositions are wiped away with a paper towel.  Successful hair removal is achieved.  The depilation composition is described in Table III below.<br>

With the present kit there is included a polypropylene non-woven high loft textile.  The vegetable oil is expressed from the pump onto the textile,  A body part requiring depilation is then coated with the sunflower seed oil by wiping with the textile.  After a one minute wait, the depilation composition of Table IV is expressed from the other compartment of the pump onto a second non-woven textile.  This composition is then applied over the sunflower seed oil pretreated area.  After a period of twenty minutes, both compositions are removed by wiping with a third non-woven textile to remove the unwanted hair.<br><br>
