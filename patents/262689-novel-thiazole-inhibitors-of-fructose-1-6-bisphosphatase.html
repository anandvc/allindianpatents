Background of the Invention<br>
Field Of The Invention<br>
[1]	The present invention is directed towards novel phosphorus-containing 5-ketothiazole compounds that are potent inhibitors of fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase). In one aspect, the invention is directed toward phosphonic acids and prodrugs thereof. In another aspect, the present invention is directed to the preparation and the clinical use of these FBPase inhibitors as a method of treatment or prevention of diseases responsive to inhibition of gluconeogenesis and in diseases responsive to lower blood glucose levels.<br>
[2]	The compounds are also useful in treating or preventing excess glycogen storage diseases and diseases such as cardiovascular diseases including atherosclerosis, myocardial ischemic injury, and diseases such as metabolic disorders such as hypercholesterolemia, hyperlipidemia which are exacerbated by hyperinsulinema and hyperglycemia.<br>
[3]	The invention also comprises the novel compounds, methods of making them and methods of using them as specified below in Formula I.<br>
Background Art<br>
[4]	The following description of the background of the invention is provided to aid in understanding the invention, but is not admitted to be, or to<br>
describe, prior art to the invention. All cited publications are incorporated by reference in their entirety.<br>
[5]	Diabetes mellitus (or diabetes) is one of die most prevalent diseases in the world today. Diabetic patients have been divided into two classes, namely type I or insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and type II diabetes mellitus (T2DM). T2DM accounts for approximately 90% of all diabetics and is estimated to affect 12-14 million adults in the U. S. alone (6.6% of the population). T2DM is characterized by both fasting hyperglycemia and exaggerated postprandial increases in plasma glucose levels. T2DM is associated with a variety of long-term complications, including microvascular diseases such as retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy, and macrovascular diseases such as coronary heart disease. Numerous studies in animal models demonstrate a causal relationship between long term hyperglycemia and complications. Results from the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) and the Stockholm Prospective Study demonstrate this relationship for the first time in man by showing that insulin-dependent diabetics with tighter glycemic control are at substantially lower risk for the development and progression of these complications. Tighter control is also expected to benefit T2DM patients.<br>
[6]	Gluconeogenesis from pyruvate and other 3-carbon precursors is a highly regulated biosynthetic pathway requiring eleven enzymes. Seven enzymes catalyze reversible reactions and are common to both gluconeogenesis and glycolysis. Four enzymes catalyze reactions unique to gluconeogenesis, namely pyruvate carboxylase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, fructose- 1,6-bisphosphatase and glucose-6-phosphatase. Overall flux through the pathway is controlled by the specific activities of these enzymes, the enzymes that catalyzed the corresponding steps in the glycolytic direction, and by substrate availability. Dietary factors (glucose, fat) and hormones (insulin, glucagon, glucocorticoids, epinephrine) coordinatively regulate enzyme activities in the gluconeogenesis and glycolysis pathways through gene expression and post-translational mechanisms.<br>
\[7]	Synthetic inhibitors of FBPase have also been reported. McNiel reported that fructose-2,6-bisphosphate analogs inhibit FBPase by binding to the substrate site. J. Am. Chem. Soc., 106:7851-7853 (1984); U.S. Patent No. 4,968,790 (1984). These compounds, however, were relatively weak and did not inhibit glucose production in hepatocytes presumably due to poor cell penetration.<br>
[8]	Gruber reported that some nucleosides can lower blood glucose in the whole animal through inhibition of FBPase. These compounds exert their activity by first undergoing phosphoiylation to the corresponding monophosphate. EP 0 427 799 Bl.<br>
[9]	Gruber et al. U.S. Patent No. 5,658,889 described the use of inhibitors of the AMP site of FBPase to treat diabetes. WO 98/39344, WO/39343, WO 98/39342, U.S. Patent No. 6,489,476, and U.S. 2002/0173490 describe specific inhibitors of FBPase to treat diabetes.<br>

[96]	Hie term "therapeutic index" refers to the ratio of the dose of a drug or prodrug that produces a therapeutically beneficial response relative to the dose that produces an undesired response such as death, an elevation of markers that are indicative of toxicity, and/or pharmacological side effects.<br>
[97]	The term "sustained delivery" refers to an increase in the period in which there is a prolongation of therapeutically-efFective drug levels due to the presence of the prodrug.<br>
[98]	The term "bypassing drug resistance" refers to the loss or partial loss of therapeutic effectiveness of a drug (drug resistance) due to changes in the biochemical pathways and cellular activities important for producing and maintaining the biological activity of the drug and the ability of an agent to bypass this resistance through the use of alternative pathways or the failure of the agent to induce changes that tend to resistance.<br>
[99]	The terms "treating" or "treatment" of a disease includes preventing the disease from occurring in an animal that may be predisposed to the disease but does not yet experience or exhibit symptoms of the disease (prophylactic treatment), inhibiting the disease (slowing or arresting its development), providing relief from the symptoms or side-effects of the disease (including palliative treatment), and relieving the disease (causing regression of the disease). <br>

[0127]	N-acetyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.5; NAT) is a Phase II drug-metabolizing<br>
enzyme that catalyzes the conjugation of an acetyl group from acetyl-CoA onto an amine, hydrazine or hydroxylamine moiety of an aromatic compound (reviewed in Upton A, Johnson N, Sandy J, Sim E, 2001, Trends Pharma. Sci. 22: 140-146). There are two NAT isozymes in humans, NAT1 and NAT2. The enzymes are polymorphic and have an important place in the history of pharmacogenetics, being first identified as responsible for the polymorphic inactivation of the anti-tubercular drug isoniazid. The genes expressing NAT1 and NAT2 are both located on chromosome 8 and share 87% and 81% nucleotide and amino acid sequence identity, respectively. NAT1<br>

[125]	In one aspect, the salt form of a compound of Formula I is selected from the group consisting of methanesulfonate, ethanesulfonate, sulfate, hydrochloride, hydrobromide, acetate, citrate and tartrate.<br>
[126]	Prodrugs of the 5-keto compounds of Formula I include compounds of the formula <br><br>
preferentially metabolizes p-am inobenzoate and p-aminosalicylate. Several allelic variants of NAT1 are known. Point mutations in the coding region of NAT1 generally result in reduced enzyme activity. The effect of mutations outside the coding region are controversial with one report indicating elevated activity and two others indicating similar activity. At least IS different allelic variants of NAT2 have been identified to date, and their frequency in the population provides a molecular explanation for the polymorphic metabolism of model substrates such as sulfamethazine and procainamide. The representation of these mutant alleles differs widely between populations of different ethnic or geographical location, with slow acetylators accounting for 10% and 40-70% of Oriental and Caucasian populations, respectively. NAT2 is more active with heterocyclic amines as substrates than is NATl. NAT2 is expressed in liver and intestinal epithelium, traditional sites of drug metabolism, whereas NATl is more ubiquitously expressed and predominates even in intestinal epithelium (Windmill KF, Gaedigk A, Hall P, et al, 2000, Tox.Sci. 54: 19-29).<br>
N-acetylase activity can markedly influence the clinical pharmacokinetics of drugs. Susceptible drugs administered orally may be acetylated during passage through the intestinal epithelium thus reducing oral bioavailability. Any drug that gains entry to the circulation intact is then subject to further NAT metabolism in the liver or other target tissues, thus further reducing drug exposure. The degree to which drug exposure is altered is expected to exhibit significant interindividual variability as a result of the high frequency of rapid acetylator and slow acetylator phenotypes in the human population. Variable drug exposure and/or the formation of N-acetylated metabolites leads to altered efficacy and tolerability profiles for certain drugs. In patients treated with the antirheumatic drug (and NAT2 substrate) sulfasalazine, for instance, a correlation was found between efficacy and NAT2 genotype/phenotype; significantly shorter drug therapy was required in slow acetylators than in rapid acetylators (Kumagai S, Komada F, Kita T et al, 2004Pharma. Res. 21: 324-329). The ratio of active sulfasalazine metabolite to inactive/N-acetylated metabolite in plasma also<br>
correlated with NAT2 activity, with a higher ratio found in slow acetylators. Similarly, in the case of the antitubercular drug isoniazid, pronounced interindividual variation in circulating isoniazid concentration and clearance were observed clinically and these correlated with hereditary differences in acetylator status (Weber WW, Hein DW, Clin. Pharmacokinet. 4:401-422 (1979)). Slow acetylation of isoniazid decreased drug clearance and was linked to an increased risk of certain side effects {e.g. peripheral neuropathy) while efficacy appeared to be largely unaffected. The formation of toxic metabolites via N-acetylation can also be an issue. Batracylin, a heterocyclic amine with antitumor activity, is N-acetylated by NAT2. The acetyl product formed has been implicated in the toxicity of this agent in animals, cells and bacteria (Stevens GJ, Payton M, Sim E, McQueen CA, Drug Metab. Dispos. 27:966-971 (1999)).<br>
[0129]	The structures of the compounds referred to in the description and<br>
examples below may be gleaned from the following table.<br><br>
As illustrated in Example C, FBPase inhibitors of the 2-amino-thiazole class with C-5 alkyl substitutions (e.g. 3.1, 3.6) were found to be highly susceptible to N-acetylation by human recombinant NAT1, and, where tested, to a lesser extent by NAT2. In addition, prodrugs of these inhibitors (e.g. 4.1, 4.6, see published international patent application WO 01/47935 A2, also published as U.S. patent application publication no. 2002/0173490 Al,<br>
incorporated herein by reference in its entirety) were extensively metabolized by human recombinant NAT2 and to a lesser extent by NATl. These results are in agreement with the known SAR of NATl, which metabolizes charged substrates, and that of NAT2, which has a preference for uncharged substrates.<br>
[131]	Exploration of the SAR of substitutions at the C-S position resulted in the discovery of a series of potent C5-keto-thiazole inhibitors (e.g. 1.1, 1.2, 1.3; Example A) which surprisingly were not metabolized by NATl (or NAT2, where tested). Moreover, the prodrugs of keto-thiazole inhibitors prepared (e.g. 2.1, 2J2,23) were found to be insusceptible to N-acetylation by NAT2 (or NATl where tested). Prodrug 2.1 activated readily in liver S9 fractions ((Example D), showed good oral bioavailability (Examples H, I, and L), potent glucose lowering in normal rats (Example G), and sustained, dose-responsive glucose lowering in diabetic rats (Example J).<br>
[132]	The insusceptibility of keto-thiazole inhibitors and their prodrugs to metabolism by NATs is expected to confer several key pharmacokinetic, therapeutic, and other advantages. NAT activity is highly expressed in the human intestine (Hickman D, Pope J, Patil SD et al., 1998, Gut 42: 402-409). Compounds that are susceptible to N-acetylation are extensively metabolized during passage across the intestinal wall into the general circulation. This reduces the oral bioavailability of the drug and consequently results in reduced potency. Compound 3.6 and its prodrug form, 4.6, are both susceptible to N-acetylation (Example C). Once acetylated, 4.6 may still be metabolically converted to N-acetyl-3.6. N-acetyl-3.6, however, is a very poor inhibitor of FBPase relative to 3.6 (Example A). The N-acetylation of either 3.6 or 4.6 thus results in drug inactivation. Compound 1.1 and its prodrug form, 2.1, in contrast to 3.6 and 4.6, are insusceptible to N-acetylation by either NATl or NAT2 (Example C). The insusceptibility of 1.1 and 2.1 to N-acetylation is likely an important factor in the 1.5-fold increased oral bioavailability of 2.1 relative to 4.6 (Examples H and I). Another important factor may be the decreased hydrophilicity of the 2-amino group that results from the presence of an electron-withdrawing keto group at the 5-position of the thiazole. This difference in oral bioavailability may be more pronounced in certain drug<br>
t*<br>
formulations which increase the intestinal transit time and thus the exposure of susceptible drugs to N-acetylase activity. The increased oral bioavailability of 2.1 translates to increased potency in type 2 diabetic patients. Compound 2.1 is consequently administered at a lower dose in patients. This is advantageous with respect to the cost of goods for the manufacturer. The lower dose also translates to a reduced risk of non-specific side effects which may be associated with the administration of FBPase inhibitors at higher doses.<br>
[133]	The liver is another key human tissue in which high NAT activity is present (Jenne JW, 1965, J. Clin. Invest. 44: 1992-2002). Following oral administration in prodrug form, FBPase inhibitors distribute at high levels to the liver in vivo (Example E) and exert their pharmacological action (glucose lowering) by inhibiting the pathway of gluconeogenesis in this organ. Susceptibility to NAT results in reduced exposure and a reduced half-life of the active inhibitor. The latter results in a loss of potency and a reduced pharmacodynamic half-life. As illustrated in Example J, the pharmacodynamic half life of 1.1 following administration of 2.1 to the ZDF rat (duration of action &gt;9 h) is significantly longer than that of the N-acetylation-susceptible 3.6 administered in 4.6 prodrug form (duration of action ~ 3 h).<br>
[134]	FBPase inhibitors and their prodrugs that are susceptible to N-acetylation are administered multiple times per day in type 2 diabetics due to lower oral bioavailability and reduced pharmacodynamic half-life. Keto-thiazole FBPase inhibitors and their prodrugs (e.g. 2.1) that are N-acetylation resistant and demonstrate higher oral bioavailability and a longer pharmacodynamic half-life are administered once or at most twice a day in patients. The ease of use and thus the degree of patient compliance is significantly improved for prodrugs of keto-thiazole FBPase inhibitors as a result of the simplified dosing regimen.<br>
[135]	N-acetylase activity is highly variable in humans due to genetic polymorphisms; it differs widely between populations of different ethnic or geographical locations (Grant DM, Hughes NC, Janezic SA et al., 1997, Mutat Res. 376: 61-70). Allelic variants of NATl are known that reduce<br>
ur<br>
enzyme activity (Lin HG, 1998, Pharmacogenetics 8: 269-281), whereas the phenotypes resulting from the hereditary polymorphism of NAT 2 can be divided into slow acetylators, intermediate acetylators, and rapid acetylators (Evans DAP, 1989, Pharmacol. Ther. 42: 157-234). The high variability in N-acetylase activity is readily apparent in a recent survey conducted by Gentest (Woburn, MA). The survey comprised an assessment of enzyme activity in liver cytosol obtained from 22 human donors (male and female Caucasian, African American. Asian, and Hispanic subjects). NAT1 activity, assayed using the standard substrate p-aminosalicyclic acid, ranged from 5.8 to 1300 nmoles product/mg protein/min. (average Â± SD 176 Â± 274). NAT2 activity, assayed using the standard substrate sulfamethazine, ranged from 21- 360 nmoles product/mg protein/min. (average Â± SD 140 Â± 119). Individual values for liver N-acetylase activity are shown in the table below.<br>

[136]	The differences in enzyme activity illustrated above can lead to high inter-individual variability in the metabolism of N-acetylase-susceptible drugs (Example K) and this may influence pharmacokinetics (e.g. oral bioavailability, half-life, Cmax) as well as efficacy. FBPase inhibitors and their prodrugs that are susceptible to N-acetylation demonstrate a variable pharmacological response in type 2 diabetic patients. When these drugs are co-administered with other N-acetylase-susceptible drugs this inter-individual variability is exacerbated as each drug interferes with die metabolism and consequently the pharmacokinetics and pharmacological response of the other. Prodrugs of keto-thiazole FBPase inhibitors (e.g. 2.1) show a uniform pharmacological response in type 2 diabetic patients and a low non-responder rate. Furthermore, they have significantly less potential for drug-drug interactions when co-administered with N-acetylase susceptible drugs.<br>
[137]	Hie formation of N-acetylated metabolites may adversely affect the safety profile of drugs. The metabolites may interact with receptors and/or enzymes thereby altering cellular metabolism/organ function and causing toxicity. In certain cases N-acetylation may lead to the formation of carcinogenic metabolites (Hein DW, Cancer Epidemiol. Biomarkers Prev. 9:9-42 (2000)). The pharmacokinetics of N-acetylated metabolites is unpredictable; they may accumulate in certain tissues or the circulation due to their low renal or hepatic clearance. Accumulation exacerbates any safety issues associated with these metabolites. Keto-thiazole FBPase inhibitors (e.g. 1.1) and their prodrugs (e.g. 2.1) are not susceptible to N-acetylation. The propensity for safety issues relating to the formation and/or accumulation of N-acetylated metabolites is thus eliminated for drugs such as 2.1 when administered to type 2 diabetic patients.<br>
[138]	Exploration of the amino acid moiety of the bisamidate prodrugs (wherein Y-R1 is an amino acid and Y is NH) of compounds of Formula I revealed that 2-methylalanine as HY-R1 displays distinct advantages with respect to oral bioavailability and efficiency of prodrug activation. The 2-methylalanine bisamidate prodrug of compound 1.1 showed 3-fold higher oral bioavailability compared to its corresponding L-alanine bisamidate prodrug (Example H: compounds 2.1 and 2.2, oral bioavailability of 30 and 11% respectively). Additionally, 2-methylalanine bisamidate prodrugs are often observed to be more efficiently converted into their corresponding active moieties. For example, assay of in vitro prodrug activation using liver S9 (Example D) showed that compound 2.1 (a 2-methylalanine bisamidate prodrug) was converted to its active moiety 1.6- to 4-fold more rapidly than compound 4.6 (an L-alanine bisamidate prodrug).<br>

These excipients may be, for example, inert diluents, such as calcium or sodium carbonate, lactose, calcium or sodium phosphate; granulating and disintegrating agents, such as maize starch, or alginic acid; binding agents, such as starch, gelatin or acacia; and lubricating agents, such as magnesium stearate, stearic acid or talc. Tablets may be uncoated or may be coated by known techniques including microencapsulation to delay disintegration and adsorption in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby provide a sustained action over a longer period. For example, a time delay material such<br>
as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate alone or with a wax may be employed.<br>
[144]	Formulations for oral use may be also presented as hard gelatin capsules where the active ingredient is mixed with an inert solid diluent, for example calcium phosphate or kaolin, or as soft gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with water or an oil medium, such as peanut oil, liquid paraffin or olive oil.<br>
[145]	Aqueous suspensions of the invention contain the active materials in admixture with excipients suitable for the manufacture of aqueous suspensions. Such excipients include a suspending agent, such as sodium carboxymethylcellulose,	methylcellulose,	ethylcellulose, hydroxypropylcellulose, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, sodium alginate, polyvinylpyrrolidone, gum tragacanth and gum acacia, and dispersing or wetting agents such as a naturally occurring phosphatide (e.g., lecithin), a condensation product of an alkylene oxide with a fatty acid (e.g., polyoxyethylene stearate), a condensation product of ethylene oxide with a long chain aliphatic alcohol (e.g., heptadecaethyleneoxycetanol), a condensation product of ethylene oxide with a partial ester derived from a fatty acid and a hexitol anhydride (e.g., polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate). The aqueous suspension may also contain one or more preservatives such as ethyl or n-propyl p-hydroxy-benzoate, one or more coloring agents, one or more flavoring agents and one or more sweetening agents, such as sucrose or saccharin.<br>
[146]	Oil suspensions may be formulated by suspending the active ingredient in a vegetable oil, such as arachid oil, olive oil, sesame oil or coconut oil, or in a mineral oil such as liquid paraffin. The oral suspensions may contain a thickening agent, such as beeswax, hard paraffin or cetyl alcohol. Sweetening agents, such as those set forth above, and flavoring agents may be added to provide a palatable oral preparation. These compositions may be preserved by the addition of an antioxidant such as ascorbic acid.<br>
[147]	Dispersible powders and granules of the invention suitable for preparation of an aqueous suspension by the addition of water provide the active ingredient in admixture with a dispersing or wetting agent, a suspending agent, and one or more preservatives. Suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents are exemplified by those disclosed above. Additional excipients, for example sweetening, flavoring and coloring agents, may also be present<br>
[148]	The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may also be in the form of oil-in-water emulsions. The oily phase may be a vegetable oil, such as olive oil or arachid oil, a mineral oil, such as liquid paraffin, or a mixture of these. Suitable emulsifying agents include naturally-occurring gums, such as gum acacia and gum tragacanth, naturally occurring phosphatides, such as soybean lecithin, esters or partial esters derived from fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides, such as sorbitan monooleate, and condensation products of these partial esters with ethylene oxide, such as polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate. The emulsion may also contain sweetening and flavoring agents.<br>
[149]	Syrups and elixirs may be formulated with sweetening agents, such as glycerol, sorbitol or sucrose. Such formulations may also contain a demulcent, a preservative, a flavoring or a coloring agent.<br>
	The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may be in the form of a sterile injectable preparation, such as a sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous suspension. This suspension may be formulated according to the known art using those suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents which have been mentioned above. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non-toxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent, such as a solution in 1,3-butane-diol or prepared as a lyophilized powder. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile fixed oils may conventionally be employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid may likewise be used in the preparation of injectables.<br>
[151]	The amount of active ingredient that may be combined with the carrier material to produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the host treated and the particular mode of administration. For example, a time-release formulation intended for oral administration to humans may contain 20 to 2000 jimol (approximately 10 to 1000 mg) of active material compounded with an appropriate and convenient amount of carrier material which may vary from about 5 to about 95% of the total compositions. It is preferred that the pharmaceutical composition be prepared which provides easily measurable amounts for administration. For example, an aqueous solution intended for intravenous infusion should contain from about 0.05 to about 50 jimol (approximately 0.025 to 25 mg) of the active ingredient per milliliter of solution in order that infusion of a suitable volume at a rate of about 30 mL/hr can occur.<br>
[152]	As noted above, formulations of the present invention suitable for oral administration may be presented as discrete units such as capsules, cachets or tablets each containing a predetermined amount of the active ingredient; as a powder or granules; as a solution or a suspension in an aqueous or non-aqueous liquid; or as an oil-in-water liquid emulsion or a water-in-oil liquid emulsion. The active ingredient may also be administered as a bolus, electuary or paste.<br>
[153]	A tablet may be made by compression or molding, optionally with one or more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets may be prepared by compressing in a suitable machine the active ingredient in a free flowing form such as a powder or granules, optionally mixed with a binder (e.g., povidone, gelatin, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose), lubricant, inert diluent, preservative, disintegrant (e.g., sodium starch glycolate, cross-linked povidone, cross-linked sodium carboxymethyl cellulose) surface active or dispersing agent. Molded tablets may be made by molding in a suitable machine a mixture of the powdered compound moistened with an inert liquid diluent. The tablets may optionally be coated or scored and may be formulated so as to provide slow or controlled release of the active ingredient therein using, for example, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose in varying proportions to provide the desired<br>
CO<br>
release profile. Tablets may optionally be provided with an enteric coating, to provide release in parts of the gut other than the stomach. This is particularly advantageous with the compounds of Formula I when such compounds are susceptible to acid hydrolysis.<br>
[154]	Formulations suitable for topical administration in the mouth include lozenges comprising the active ingredient in a flavored base, usually sucrose and acacia or tragacanth; pastilles comprising the active ingredient in an inert base such as gelatin and glycerin, or sucrose and acacia; and mouthwashes comprising the active ingredient in a suitable liquid carrier.<br>
[155]	Formulations for rectal administration may be presented as a suppository with a suitable base comprising for example cocoa butter or a salicylate.<br>
[156]	Formulations suitable for vaginal administration may be presented as<br>
pessaries, tampons, creams, gels, pastes, foams or spray formulations<br>
i<br>
containing in addition to the active ingredient such carriers as are known in the art to be appropriate.<br>
[157]	Formulations suitable for parenteral administration include aqueous and non-aqueous isotonic sterile injection solutions which may contain antioxidants, buffers, bacteriostats and solutes which render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient; and aqueous and non-aqueous sterile suspensions which may include suspending agents and thickening agents. The formulations may be presented in unit-dose or multi-dose sealed containers, for example, ampoules and vials, and may be stored in a freeze-dried (lyophilized) condition requiring only the addition of the sterile liquid carrier, for example water for injections, immediately prior to use. Injection solutions and suspensions may be prepared from sterile powders, granules and tablets of the kind previously described.<br>
[158]	Formulations suitable for parenteral administration may be administered in a continuous infusion manner via an indwelling pump or via a hospital bag. Continuous infusion includes the infusion by an external pump. The infusions may be done through a Hickman or PICC or any other suitable means of administering a formulation either parenterally or i.v.<br>
c,[159]	Preferred unit dosage formulations are those containing a daily dose or unit, daily sub-dose, or an appropriate fraction thereof, of a drug.<br>
	It will be understood, however, that the specific dose level for any particular patient will depend on a variety of factors including the activity of the specific compound employed; the age, body weight, general health, sex and diet of the individual being treated; the time and route of administration; the rate of excretion; other drugs which have previously been administered; and the severity of the particular disease undergoing therapy, as is well understood by those skilled in the art<br>
Synthesis of the Compounds of the Invention<br>
[161]	The compounds in this invention may be prepared by the processes described in the following discussions, as well as relevant published literature procedures that are used by those skilled in the art. It should be understood that the following discussions are provided solely for the purpose of illustration and do not limit the invention which is defined by the claims. Typically the synthesis of a compound of Formula I includes the following general steps (listed in reversed order): (1) Preparation of a prodrug; (2) Deprotection of a phosphonate ester; (3) Modifications of an existing thiazole; (4) Construction of a thiazole; and (5) Preparation of key precursors. Protection and deprotection in the Schemes may be carried out according to the procedures generally known in the art (e.g., "Protecting Groups in Organic Synthesis," 3rd Edition, Wiley, 1999).<br>
[162]	All stereoisomers of the compounds of the instant invention are contemplated, either in admixture or in pure or substantially pure form. The compounds of the present invention can have stereogenic centers at the phosphorus atom and at any of the carbons including any of the R substituents. Consequently, compounds of Formula I can exist in enantiomeric or diastereomeric forms or in mixtures thereof. The processes for preparation can utilize racemates, enantiomers or diastereomers as starting materials. When enantiomeric or diastereomeric products are prepared, they can be separated by conventional methods. For example, chromatography or fractional crystallization can be used to separate diastereomeric mixtures, while derivatives of enantiomeric isomers can be separated via chromatography.<br>
1) Preparation of a prodrug<br>
[163]	Prodrugs can be introduced at different stages of the synthesis. Most often these prodrugs are introduced at the later stage of a synthesis due to the lability of various prodrugs.<br>
[164]	Phosphonic acids of Formula I wherein both Ys are O and R1 is H, which may be in a suitably protected form, can be alkylated with electrophiles such as alkyl halides and alkyl sulfonates under nucleophilic substitution conditions to give phosphonate esters. For example, compounds of Formula I wherein Y is O and R1 is an acyloxyalkyl group can be prepared by direct alkylation of compounds of Formula I wherein both Ys are O and R1 is H with an appropriate acyloxyalkyl halide (e.g. CI, Br, I; Phosphorus Sulfur 1990,54, 143; Synthesis 1988, 62) in the presence of a suitable base (e.g. pyridine, TEA, diisopropylethylamine) in suitable solvents such as DMF (J. Med. Chem. 1994, 37, 1875). The carboxylate component of these acyloxyalkyl halides includes but is not limited to acetate, propionate, isobutyrate, pivalate, benzoate, carbonate and other carboxylales.<br>
[165]	Dimethylformamide dialkyl acetals can also be used for the alkylation of phosphonic acids (Collect. Czech Chem. Commu. 1994, 59, 1853). Compounds of Formula I wherein Y is O and R1 is a cyclic carbonate, a lactone or a phthalidyl group can also be synthesized by direct alkylation of the free phosphonic acids with appropriate halides in the presence of a suitable base such as NaH or diisopropylethylamine (J. Med. Chem. 1995, 38, 1372; J. Med. Chem. 1994, 37, 1857; J. Pharm. Sci. 1987, 76, 180).<br>
[166]	Alternatively, these phosphonate prodrugs can be synthesized by the reactions of the corresponding dichlorophosphonates and an alcohol (Collect Czech Chem. Commun. 1994, 59, 1853). For example, a dichlorophosphonate is reacted with substituted phenols and arylalkyl alcohols in the presence of a base such as pyridine or TEA to give the compounds of Formula I wherein Y <br>
O<br>
is O and R1 is an aiyl group (J. Med Chem. 1996, 39, 4109; J. Med Chem. 1995,38,1372; J. Med Chem. 1994,37,498) or an aiylalkyl group (J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 1 1992, 38, 2345). The disulfide-containing prodrugs (Antiviral Res. 1993, 22, 155) can be prepared from a dichlorophosphonate and 2-hydroxyethyldisulfide under standard conditions.<br>
[167]	Dichlorophosphonates are also useful for the preparation of various phosphonamides as prodrugs. For example, treatment of a dichlorophosphonate with an amine (e.g. an amino acid alkyl ester such as L-alanine ethyl ester) in the presence of a suitable base (e.g. triethylamine, pyridine, etc.) gives the corresponding bisphosphonamide; treatment of a<br>
\	dichlorophosphonate with l-amino-3-propanol gives a cyclic<br>
1,3-propylphosphonamide; treatment of a chlorophosphonate monophenyl ester with an aminoacid ester in the presence of a suitable base gives a substituted monophenyl monophosphonamidate. Direct couplings of a phosphonic acid with an amine (e.g. an amino acid alkyl ester such as L-alanine ethyl ester) are also reported to give the corresponding bisamidates under Mukaiyama conditions (J. Am. Chem. Soc., 1972,94, 8528).<br>
[168]	Such reactive dichlorophosphonates can be generated from the corresponding phosphonic acids with a chlorinating agent (e.g. thionyl chloride, J. Med. Chem. 1994, 1857; oxalyl chloride, Tetrahedron Lett. 1990, 31, 3261; phosphorous pentachloride, Synthesis 1974, 490). Alternatively, a dichlorophosphonate can be generated from its corresponding disilyl<br>
^	phosphonate esters (Synth. Commu. 1987, 17, 1071) or dialkyl phosphonate<br>
esters (Tetrahedron Lett. 1983,24,4405; Bull Soc. Chim. 1993,130,485).<br>
[169]	It is envisioned that compounds of Formula I can be mixed phosphonate ester (e.g. phenyl and benzyl esters, or phenyl and acyloxyalkyl esters) including the chemically combined mixed esters such as phenyl and benzyl combined prodrugs reported in Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1997, 7,99.<br>
	The SATE (S-acetyl thioethyl) prodrugs can be synthesized by the coupling reaction of the phosphonic acids of Formula I and S-acyl-2-thioethanol in the presence of DCC, EDCI or PyBOP (J. Med. Chem. 1996, 39, 1981).<br>
[171]	Cyclic phosphonate esters of substituted 1,3-propane diols can be synthesized by either reactions of the corresponding dichlorophosphonate with a substituted 1,3-propanediol or coupling reactions using suitable coupling reagents (e.g. DCC, EDCI, PyBOP; Synthesis 1988, 62). The reactive dichlorophosphonate intermediates can be prepared from the corresponding acids and chlorinating agents such as thionyl chloride (J. Med. Chem., 1994, 1857), oxalyl chloride (Tetrahedron Lett., 1990, 31: 3261) and phosphorus pentachloride (Synthesis, 1974, 490). Alternatively, these dichlorophosphonates can also be generated from disilyl esters (Synth. Commun., 1987, 17: 1071) and dialkyl esters (Tetrahedron Lett., 1983, 24: 4405; Bull. Soc. Chim. Fr., 1993,130: 485).<br>
[172]	Alternatively, these cyclic phosphonate esters of substituted 1,3-propane diols are prepared from phosphonic acids by coupling with diols under Mitsunobu reaction conditions (Synthesis 1 (1981); J. Org. Chem. 52:6331 (1992)), and other acid coupling reagents including, but not limited to, carbodiimides (Collect. Czech. Chem. Commun. 59:1853 (1994); Bioorg. Med Chem. Lett. 2:145 (1992); Tetrahedron Lett. 29:1189 (1988)), and benzotriazolyloxytris-(dimethylamino) phosphonium salts (Tetrahedron Lett. 34, 6743 (1993)).<br>
[173]	Phosphonic acids also undergo cyclic prodrug formation with cyclic acetals or cyclic ortho esters of substituted propane- 1,3-diols to provide prodrugs as in the case of carboxylic acid esters (Helv. Chim. Acta. 48:1746 (1965)). Alternatively, more reactive cyclic sulfites or sulfates are also suitable coupling precursors to react with phosphonic acid salts. These precursors can be made from the corresponding diols as described in the literature.<br>
[174]	Alternatively, cyclic phosphonate esters of substituted 1,3-propane diols can be synthesized by trans esterification reaction with substituted 1,3-propane diol under suitable conditions. Mixed anhydrides of parent phosphonic acids generated in situ under appropriate conditions react with diols to give prodrugs as in the case of carboxylic acid esters (Bull. Chem. Soc. Jpn. 52:1989 (1979)). Aryl esters of phosphonates are also known to undergo<br>
transesterification with alkoxy intermediates (Tetrahedron Lett. 38:2597 (1997); Synthesis 968 (1993)).<br>
[175]	A suitable prodrug of the 2-amino group of compounds of Formula I can also be prepared according reported procedures (J. Med. Chem., 47: 2393(2004); Int. J. Antimicrob. Agents, 18: (451 (2001)).<br>
[176]	In another aspect, a suitable prodrug of the 5-keto group of compounds of Formula I are also envisioned, which may lead to enhanced pharmaceutical properties such as solubility and stability etc.. Therefore, prodrugs of the keto group at the C5-position of the thiazole ring in compounds of formula I can be prepared using conventional synthetic methods. For example, thioketones can be prepared from their corresponding ketones, and this transformation can be conducted either in the early stage of the synthesis or once the thiazole ring is already formed. Reagents suitable for such transformation include Lawesson's reagent under various conditions (Tetrahedron Lett., 42: 6167 (2001); J. Am. Chem. Soc., 125: 9560 (2003)). Furthermore, sulfoxides of thioketones can also be prepared from their corresponding thioketones under oxidative conditions using a suitable oxidant (e.g. mCPBA,); J. Am. Chem. Soc., 125: 12114 (2003)). Imines and oximes and their derivatives are also envisioned as potential prodrugs of the keto group at the C5-position of the thiazole ring for compounds of formula I. Imines and oximes are readily prepared from their corresponding ketones (Larock, Comprehensive organic transformations, VCH, New York, 1989). Moreover, various salt forms of imines and/or oximes can also be prepared such as methanesulfonic acid, hydrogen chloride salts.<br>
[177]	One aspect of the present invention provides methods to synthesize and isolate single isomers of prodrugs of phosphonic acids of Formula I. Because phosphorus is a stereogenic atom, formation of a prodrug with a racemic substituted-1,3-propane-diol will produce a mixture of isomers. For example, formation of a prodrug with a racemic l-(V)-substituted-l,3-propane diol gives a racemic mixture of cis-prodrugs and a racemic mixture of trans-prodrugs. In an other aspect, the use of the enantioenriched substituted-1,3-propane diol with the R-configuration gives enantioenriched<br>
Qo<br>
R-cis-and R-trans-prodrugs. These compounds can be separated by a combination of column chromatography and/or fractional crystallization.<br>
2) Deprotection of a phosphonate ester<br>
Compounds of Formula I wherein R1 is H may be prepared from phosphonate esters using known phosphate and phosphonate ester cleavage conditions. Silyl halides are generally used to cleave various phosphonate esters, and subsequent mild hydrolysis of the resulting silyl phosphonate esters give the desired phosphonic acids. When required, acid scavengers (e.g. 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexamethyldisilazane, 2,6-lutidine, etc.) can be used for the synthesis of acid labile compounds. Such silyl halides include chlorotrimethylsilane (Rabinowitz, J. Org. Chem., 1963, 28: 2975), and bromotrimethylsilane (McKenna, et al, Tetrahedron Lett., 1977, 155), and iodotrimethylsilane (Blackburn, et al., J. Chem. Soc., Chem. Commun., 1978, 870). Alternately, phosphonate esters can be cleaved under strong acidic conditions (e.g. HBr or HC1 : Moffatt, et al, U.S. Patent 3,524,846, 1970). These esters can also be cleaved via dichlorophosphonates, prepared by treating the esters with halogenating agents (e.g. phosphorus pentachloride, thionyl chloride, BBr3 : Pelchowicz et al., J. Chem. Soc., 1961, 238) followed by aqueous hydrolysis to give phosphonic acids. Aryl and benzyl phosphonate esters can be cleaved under hydrogenolysis conditions (Lejczak, et al., Synthesis, 1982, 412; Elliott, et al., J. Med Chem., 1985, 28: 1208; Baddiley, et al., Nature, 1953, 171: 76 ) or metal reduction conditions (Shafer, et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc., 1977, 99: 5118). Electrochemical (Shono, et al., J. Org. Chem., 1979, 44: 4508) and pyrolysis (Gupta, et al., Synth. Commun., 1980, 10: 299) conditions have also been used to cleave various phosphonate esters.<br>
(3) Modification of an existing thiazole<br>
Although it is advantageous to have the desired substituents present when a thiazole ring is formed, in some cases, the desired substituents are not compatible with subsequent reactions, and therefore modifications of an existing thiazole are envisioned using conventional chemistry (Larock,<br>
r^r<br>
Vo<br>
Comprehensive organic transformations, VCH, New York, 1989; Trost, Comprehensive organic synthesis', Pergamon press, New York, 1991). For example, the 2-amino group of compounds of Formula I can be synthesized for the corresponding 2-bromothiazole analogs using transition metal catalyzed amination reactions. Alternatively, the 2-amino group can be obtained from the corresponding 2-carboxylic acid or its derivitaves using conventional chemistry such as Curtius rearrangement and Beckman rearrangement reactions. Substitutions at the 4-position of thiazoles of Formula I can be introduced in various ways, if the desired group is not present when the thiazole is formed. For example, aryl groups are readily coupled onto a thiazole with a suitable C4-leaving group such as a bromo or triflate group using transition metal chemistry such as Stille and Suzuki reactions (Farina et al., Organic Reactions, Vol. 50; Wiley, New York, 1997; Mitchell, Synthesis, 1992, 808; Suzuki, Pure App. Chem., 1991, 63, 419). It is also possible that the keto group at the 5-position of compounds of Formula I may also be introduced once the thiazole is formed.<br>
[180]	For example, the conventional acylation reactions (e.g. Friedel-Crafts reactions) can be used to introduce a keto group onto the 5-position of an unsubstituted thiazole; lithiation of a C5-unsubstituted thiazole followed by reaction with a suitable caibonyl derivative such as Weinreb's amide, or addition to an aldehyde followed by oxidation of Ihe resulting alcohol will also give 5-ketothiazole analogs. Alternatively, transition metal chemistry can also be used to introduce a keto group to the 5-position of a thiazole. For example, a thiazole-5-stannyl derivative is reacted with a halide under carbon monoxide atmosphere to give 5-ketothiazole analogs, while couplings of organotin derivatives with acyl halides have often been reported to give ketone derivatives.<br>
(4) Construction of a thiazole<br>
[181]	Aminothiazoles useful for the present invention can be readily prepared using well described ring-forming reactions (Metzger, Thiazole and its derivatives, part 1 and part 2; Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, 1979).<br>
Cyclization reactions of thiourea and alpha-halocarbonyl compounds (such as aipha-haloketones, alpha-haloaldehydes) are particularly useful for the construction of an aminothiazole ring system. For example, cyclization reactions between thiourea and 5 -diethylphosphono-2-[(2 -bromo- l,3-dioxo)alkyl]furans are useful for the synthesis of compounds of Formula I wherein Rn is an alkyl group. In this case, two aminothiazole regioisomers may be formed; acquisition of the desired regioisomer may be controlled by appropriate selection of conditions for both the cyclization reaction and isolation of the product.<br>
[182]	Alpha-halocarbonyl compounds are readily accessible via conventional reactions (Larock, Comprehensive organic transformations, VCH, New York, 1989). Ketones can be halogenated using various halogenating reagents (e.g. NBS, CuBr2, SO2CI2); some examples are given in the following section.<br>
(5) Preparation of various precursors useful for cyclization reactions<br>
A. Preparation of general key intermediates<br>
[183]	Intermediates required for the synthesis of compounds in the present invention are generally prepared using either an existing method in the literature or a modification of an existing method. Syntheses of some of the intermediates useful for the synthesis of compounds in the present invention are described herein.<br>
[184]	Various aryl phosphonate dialkyl esters are particularly useful for the synthesis of compounds of Formula I. For example, compounds of Formula I can be prepared from a variety of furanyl precursors. 5-Dialkylphosphono-2-furancarbonyl	compounds	(e.g. 5-diethylphosphono-2-furaldehyde, 5-diethylphosphono-furan-2-yl ketones) are well suited for the synthesis of compounds of Formula I. These intermediates are prepared from furan or furan derivatives using conventional chemistry such as lithiation reactions, protection of carbonyl groups and deprotection of carbonyl groups. For example, lithiation of furan using known methods (Gschwend Org. React. 1979, 26: 1) followed by addition of<br>
phosphorylating agents (e.g. CIPO3R2) gives 2-dialkylphosphono-furans (e.g. 2-diethylphosphonofiiran). This method can also be applied to a 2-substituted furan such as 2-fiiroic acid to give a 5-dialkylphosphono-2-substituted furan such as 5-diethylphosphono-2-furoic acid. Alternatively, other methods such as transition metal catalyzed reactions of aiyl halides or triflates (Balthazar et al., J. Org. Chem., 1980, 45: 5425; Petrakis et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc., 1987, 109: 2831; Lu et al., Synthesis, 1987, 726) are used to prepare aiyl phosphonates.<br>
A second lithiation step can be used to incorporate a second group on the furan-2-yl phosphonate dialkyl ester such as an aldehyde group, a trialkylstannyl, a keto group or a halo group, although other methods known to generate these functionalities (e.g. aldehydes) can be envisioned as well. For example, Vilsmeier-Haack reaction or Reimar-Teimann reactions can be used for aldehyde synthesis, while Friedel-Crafts reactions can be used to prepare keto-furan derivatives. In the second lithiation step, the lithiated furan ring is treated with reagents that either directly generate the desired functional group (e.g. for an aldehyde using DMF, HCO2R, etc.) or with reagents that lead to a group that is subsequently transformed into the desired functional group using known chemistry (e.g. alcohols, esters, nitrites, alkenes can be transformed into aldehydes). For example, lithiation of a 2-dialkylphosphonofuran (e.g. 2-diethylphosphonofuran) under normal conditions (e.g. LDA in THF) followed by trapping of the thus generated anion with an electrophile (e.g. tributyltin chloride or iodine) produces a 5-functionalized- 2-dialkylphosphonofuran (e.g. 5-tributylstannyl-2-diethylphosphonofuran or 5-iodo-2-diethylphosphonofuran). It is also envisioned that the sequence of these reactions can be reversed, i.e. the aldehyde moiety can be incorporated first followed by the phosphorylation reaction. The order of the reaction will be dependent on reaction conditions and protecting groups. Prior to the phosphorylation, it is also envisioned that it may be advantageous to protect some of these functional groups using a number of well-known methods (e.g. protection of aldehydes as acetals, aminals; protection of ketones as ketals).<br>
The protected functional group is then unmasked after phosphorylation. (Protective groups in Organic Synthesis, Greene, T. W., 1991, Wiley, New York). For example, protection of 2-furaldehyde as 1,3-propanediol acetal followed by a lithiation step (using for example LDA) and trapping the anion with a dialkyl chlorophosphate (e.g. diethyl chlorophosphate), and subsequent deprotection of the acetal functionality under normal deprotection conditions produces the 5-dialkylphosphono-2-furaldehyde (e.g. 5-diethylphosphono- 2-furaldehyde). Another example is the preparation of 5-keto-2- dialkylphosphonofurans which encompass the following steps: acylations of furan under Friedel-Crafts reaction conditions give 2-ketofuran, subsequent protection of the ketone as ketals (e.g. 1,3-propanediol cyclic ketal) followed by a lithiation step as described above gives the 5-dialkylphosphono-2-furanketone with the ketone being protected as a 1,3-propanediol cyclic ketal, and final deprotection of the ketal under, for example, acidic conditions gives 2-keto-5-dialkylphosphonofiirans (e.g. 2-acetyl-5-diethylphosphonofuran). Alternatively, 2-ketofurans can be synthesized via a palladium catalyzed reaction between 2-trialkylstannylfurans (e.g. 2-tributylstannylfiiran) and an acyl chloride (e.g. acetyl chloride, isobutyryl chloride). It is advantageous to have the phosphonate moiety present in the 2-trialkylstannylfurans (e.g. 2-tributylstannyl- 5-diethylphosphonofuran). 2-Keto-5-dialkylphosphonofurans can also be prepared from a 5-dialkylphosphono-2-furoic acid (e.g. 5-diethylphosphono-2-furoic acid) by conversion of the acid to the corresponding acyl chloride or a Weinreb's amide and followed by additions of a Grignard reagent.<br>
[0186]	Some of the above described intermediates can also be used for the<br>
synthesis of other useful intermediates. For example, a 2-keto-5-dialkylphosphonofuran can be further converted to a 1,3-dicarbonyl derivative such as a 5-(l,3-dioxo-alkyl)furan-2-yl phosphonate dialkyl ester, which is further converted to a 5-(2-halo-l,3-dioxo-alkyl)fiiran-2-yl phosphonate dialkyl ester that is useful for the reaction with a thioamide (e.g. thiourea) to give thiazole analogs.<br>
[187]	It is conceivable that when applicable the above described synthetic methods can be adapted for parallel synthesis either on solid phase or in solution to provide rapid SAR (structure activity relationship) exploration of FBPase inhibitors encompassed in the current invention, provided method development for these reactions is successful.<br>
B. Preparation of 1,3-Diols<br>
[188]	Various methods can be used to prepare 1,3-propanediols such as 1-substituted, 2-substituted, 1,2-or 1,3-annulated 1,3-propanediols.<br>
1. 1-Substituted 1,3-propanediols<br>
[189]	1,3-Propanediols useful in the synthesis of compounds in the present invention can be prepared using various synthetic methods. As described in Scheme 10, additions of an aryl Grignard to a 1 -hydroxy-propan-3 -al give 1-aryl-substituted 1,3-propanediols (path a). This method is suitable for the conversion of various aryl halides to 1-arylsubstituted-1,3-propanediols (J. Org. Chem. 1988, 53, 911). Conversions of aryl halides to 1-substituted 1,3-propanediols can also be achieved using Heck reactions (e.g. couplings with a l,3-diox-4-ene) followed by reductions and subsequent hydrolysis reactions (Tetrahedron Lett. 1992,33,6845). Various aromatic aldehydes can also be converted to 1-substituted-1,3-propanediols using alkenyl Grignard addition reactions followed by hydroboration-oxidation reactions (path b). <br>
Scheme 10<br>
Aldol reactions between an enolate (e.g. lithium, boron, tin enolates) of a carboxylic acid derivative (e.g. tert-butyl acetate) and an aldehyde (e.g. the Evans's aldol reactions) are especially useful for the asymmetric synthesis of enantioenriched 1,3-propanediols. For example, reaction of a metal enolate of /-butyl acetate with an aromatic aldehyde followed by reduction of die ester (path e) gives a 1,3-propanediol (J. Org. Chem. 1990, 55 4744). Alternatively, epoxidation of cinnamyl alcohols using known methods (e.g. Sharpless epoxidations and other asymmetric epoxidation reactions) followed by reduction reactions (e.g. using Red-Al) give various 1,3-propanediols (path c). Enantioenriched 1,3-propanediols can be obtained via asymmetric reduction reactions (e.g. enantioselective borane reductions) of 3-hydroxy-ketones (Tetrahedron Lett. 1997,38 761). Alternatively, resolution of racemic 1,3-propanediols using various methods (e.g. enzymatic or chemical methods) can also give enantioenriched 1,3-propanediol. Propan-3-ols with a 1-heteroaryl substituent (e.g. a pyridyl, a quinolinyl or an isoquinolinyl) can be oxygenated to give 1-substituted 1,3-propanediols using N-oxide formation reactions followed by a rearrangement reaction in acetic anhydride conditions (path d) (Tetrahedron 1981, 37,1871). <br><br>
2. 2-Substituted 1,3-propanediols<br>
A variety of 2-substituted 1,3-propanediols useful for the synthesis of compounds of Formula I can be prepared from various other 1,3-propanediols (e.g. 2-(hydroxymethyl)-l,3-propanediols) using conventional chemistry (Comprehensive Organic Transformations, VCH, New York, 1989). For example, as described in Scheme 11, reductions of a trialkoxycarbonyl- m ethane under known conditions give a triol via complete reduction (path a) or a bis(hydroxymethyl)acetic acid via selective hydrolysis of one of the ester groups followed by reduction of the remaining two other ester groups. Nitrotriols are also known to give triols via reductive elimination (path b) (Synthesis 1987, 8, 742). Furthermore, a 2-(hydroxymethyl)-l,3-propanediol can be converted to a mono acylated derivative (e.g. acetyl, methoxycarbonyl) using an acyl chloride or an alkyl chloroformate (e.g. acetyl chloride or methyl chloroformate) (path d) using known chemistry (Protective Groups In Organic Synthesis; Wiley, New York, 1990). Other functional group manipulations can also be used to prepare 1,3-propanediols such as oxidation of one the hydroxymethyl groups in a 2-(hydroxymethyl)-l,3-propanediol to an aldehyde followed by addition reactions with an aryl Grignard (path c). Aldehydes can also be converted to alkyl amines via reductive amination reactions (path e).<br>
Scheme 11<br>
3. Annulated 1,3-propane diols<br>
[0192]	Compounds of Formula I wherein V and Z or V and W are connected<br>
by four carbons to form a ring can be prepared from a 1,3-cyclohexanediol. For example, cis, cis-1,3,5-cyclohexanetriol can be modified to give various other 1,3,5-cyclohexanetriols which are useful for the preparations of compounds of Formula I wherein R11 and R11 together are<br>
V<br>
w<br>
wherein together V and W are connected via 3 atoms to form a cyclic group containing 6 carbon atoms substituted with a hydroxy group. It is envisioned that these modifications can be performed either before or after formation of a cyclic phosphonate 1,3-propanediol ester. Various 1,3-cyclohexanediols can also be prepared using Diels-Alder reactions (e.g. using a pyrone as the diene: Tetrahedron Lett. 1991, 32, 5295). 2-Hydroxymethylcyclohexanols and 2-hydroxymethylcyclopentanols are useful for the preparations of compounds of Formula I wherein R11 and R11 together are<br>
V<br>
w<br>
wherein together V and Z are connected via 2 or 3 atoms to form a cyclic group containing 5 or 6 carbon atoms. 1,3-Cyclohexanediol derivatives are also prepared via other cycloaddition reaction methodologies. For example, cycloadducts from the cycloadditon reactions of a nitrile oxide and an olefin can be converted to a 2-ketoethanol derivative which can be further converted to a 1,3-propanediol (includingl,3-cyclohexanediol, 2-hydroxymethylcyclohexanol and 2-hydroxymethylcyclopentanol) using known chemistry (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 107:6023 (1985)). Alternatively, precursors to 1,3-cyclohexanediol can be made from quinic acid (Tetrahedron Lett. 32:541 (1991)).<br>

Formula I<br>
Compounds of Formula / can be derived from formation of bonds a-g in any order. For example, in Schemes 1 and 3, the key bond forming steps, in order are: d, g, c/e, h, wherein the bonds a, b and / are present in the commercially available starting materials. In Scheme 4, bond/is formed last, whereas in Scheme 5, bond g is formed last. Scheme 6 involves early formation of bond g, whereas in Scheme 7, bond e is formed followed by bond d, using a Mannich reaction. <br>
Compounds of Formula / can be prepared by the synthetic scheme shown in Scheme 1. 5-Bromo-2-furoic acid Sl.l is converted to the acid chloride S1.2 with oxalyl chloride or other suitable reagent. The acid chloride SI.2 is condensed with the anion of a methyl, R11 ketone, where Ru is alkyl, aryl or a heterocyclic group, to form diketone SU. The bromofuran diketone S13 is phosphonylated with dialkylphosphite or diarylphosphite to the <br>
diketone S1.4 using a suitable transition metal catalyst complex such as tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0). The diketone S1.4 is halogenated with a suitable reagent such as bromine or sulfuryl chloride to provide crude halodiketone S1.5 as a thick oil. The halodiketone S1.5 is condensed with thiourea to provide thiazole S1.6. The dialkylphosphonate or diarylphosphonate functionality of S1.6 is deprotected a using suitable reagent such as a trimethylsilyl halide, sodium hydroxide or mineral acid in an alcohol to provide the phosphonic acid S1.7.<br>
In one synthetic pathway, the phosphonic acid S1.7 is converted to an amidine-protected phosphonodichloridate using suitable reagents such as oxalyl chloride with a dialkylformamide, or thionyl chloride. The phosphonodichoridate is treated with a suitable primary or secondary amine and a suitable acid-scavenging base such as triethylamine or diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA), to provide the crude bis-amidate S1.8 (Prot-N(Prot)- is R-N(R')-C(H)=N- wherein R and R' are independently C1-4 alkyl). The amidine protecting group is removed with a suitable reagent such as acetic acid in ethanol to form the product /.<br>
The synthetic pathway described in the previous paragraph illustrates the formation of SI.8 from S1.7 in which the same reagent(s)-oxalyl chloride/dimethylformamide-serves both to activate the phosphonic ester moiety and to protect the exocyclic amino group of the compound of Formula S1.7 as an amidine, i.e., the activation of the phosphonic acid moiety of S1.7 and the protection of the exocyclic amino moiety of S1.7 are concurrent. This pathway is not favored when in the desired compound of Formula I, the moiety -YR1 is of the acyloxyalkyl type. However, in another synthetic pathway illustrated in Scheme 1, the exocyclic nitrogen of S1.7 is first protected with a suitable amino-protecting group to form phosphonic acid S1.9. The phosphonic acid S1.9 is then activated, and treated as described for the phosphonodichoridate in the preceding paragraph. The protecting group is removed with a suitable reagent to form the product I. This pathway is favored for making compounds of Formula/ wherein -YR1 is of the<br>
acyloxyalkyl type, but is also suitable for the entire scope of -YR1 as that moiety is defined above.<br>

	The reaction can be carried out in a suitable solvent such as include ethanol, isopropanol, CH3CN, THF, DMF and the like, at a suitable temperature such as from about 25 Â°C to about 100 Â°C .<br>
[379]	The compound of Formula C7.5 is deprotected to form the compound of Formula/.<br>
[380]	Throughout, each of N-Prot' and N-Prot" is independently a nitrogen atom protected with any group suitable for protecting the nitrogen atom of the particular functional group. Examples of useful protecting groups (such as Boc and Cbz), their formation and their removal (with reagents such as TFA, HC1, H2 and H2/Pd-C) may be found in Greene, supra. More useful protecting groups include carbamates such as Boc and Cbz. Also useful are protecting groups such as para-methoxyphenyl.<br><br><br>
[381]	Alternatively, the compound of Formula C7.4 is reacted with a compound of formula MeSCN, wherein MÂ® is a monocation, to form a <br><br>
compound of Fonnula C7.5 wherein Prot' is hydrogen. The reaction can be carried out in a suitable solvent such as ethanol, isopropanol, CH3CN, THF, DMF and the like, at a suitable reaction temperature such as from about 2SÂ°C to about 100 Â°C.

Where Mc is magnesium, the magnesium atom will be divalent, i.e., MÂ° will be in the form of, e.g., MgCl or MgBr. Where MÂ° is copper, the reactant is CuRn-X(ligand) or CuRn(Cu I). Ligands suitable for this reaction are known in the art.<br>
[387]	The reaction can be carried out in a suitable solvent, such as THF, ethanol, dioxane, DME, toluene and the like, at a suitable temperature, such as from about 0Â°C to about-78Â°C.<br>
