				<td>CROSS REFERENCE TO REIATED APPLICATION<br>
This' application claims the priority of U.S. provisional<br>
patent application Ser. No. 60/553,504 filed on March 16,<br>
2004, entitled " Digital Signal Processor Implementation<br>
Of High Impedance Fault Algorithms" the contents of which<br>
are relied upon and incorporated herein by reference in<br>
their entirety, and the benefit of priority under 35<br>
U.S.C. 119(e) is hereby claimed.<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to algorithms for determining<br>
the occurrence of a high impedance fault (HIF) condition<br>
and more particularly to the implementation of. those<br>
algorithms using a digital signal processor (DSP) in a<br>
relay platform.<br>
2.	Description of the Prior Art<br>
Electric utility companies use overhead energized<br>
conductors to transport electrical energy to consumers.<br>
There are over one million miles of overhead distribution<br>
lines in the United States, supplying energy for<br>
industrial, commercial, and residential customers. The<br>
overhead conductors are exposed to the elements and to<br>
abnormal conditions. In some cases, the conductors fall<br>
to the ground and, depending on the surface, establish a<br>
conducting path. If the surface is grass, soil, or<br>
asphalt, a HIF occurs, in which case the fault current is<br>
much smaller than that of a typical, phase-to-ground<br>
fault. This smaller fault current makes detection of<br>
such instances difficult with conventional protection<br>
devices.<br>
The danger with downed or open conductors is the<br>
risk of public contact with the energized lines. Human<br>
contact with downed conductors can result in serious<br>
injury or even death. The problem is further complicated<br>
ones a downed conductor is detected. If a relay trips a<br><br>
circuit breaker at a substation, the loss of power to<br>
vital public entities, such as hospitals, airports, and<br>
traffic signals, can result in life-threatening<br>
situations of equal or greater magnitude. Thus, the<br>
problems facing protection engineers are to first detect<br>
the disturbances and then to react appropriately.<br>
U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 10/770,270 filed<br>
on February 2, 2004 and entitled "High Impedance Fault<br>
Detection" ("the '270 application"), the disclosure of<br>
which is hereby incorporated herein by reference, and is<br>
assigned to the same assignee as the present invention,<br>
describes the implementation in a, relay' platform of three<br>
detection algorithms that each use various features of<br>
phase and/or ground currents to Individually detect a<br>
HIF. The HIF detection algorithms described in the A270<br>
application are wavelet based, higher order statistics<br>
based and neural network based. It is desirable to<br>
implement the three algorithms with a DSP as the DSP is<br>
needed for data acquisition and scaling and performs some<br>
of the work so that the CPU (central processing- unit) in<br>
the relay does not have to do everything but:<br>
each of the algorithms in their original formats<br>
cover 10 seconds worth of data and thus need a lot of<br>
computation power and precision; and<br>
it is impossible to implement the algorithms in<br>
their original formats due to hardware limitations and<br>
floating-point computations requirements.<br>
The present invention allows the three detection<br>
algorithms to be implemented on the relay platform with a<br>
DSP. In accordance with the present invention:<br>
the algorithms are modified to process one (1)<br>
second of data instead of 10 seconds and circular<br>
buffering and accumulation techniques are used to achieve<br>
the solution;<br>
double buffering is used for the acquisition; and<br>
there is a fixed-point implementation of each<br><br>
algorithm.<br>

ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
Fig. 1 shows a block diagram for the double buffered<br>
acquisition system used in the system of the present<br>
invention..<br>
Fig. 2 shows an embodiment for the circular buffering<br>
system used in the system of the present invention.<br>
Description of the Preferred Embodiment (s)<br>
Referring now to Fig. 1, there is shown a block<br>
diagram for the double buffered acquisition system 10.<br>
System 10 uses a first buffer. 12 and a second buffer 14<br>
to store data. While system 10 is storing incoming data<br><br>
in the first buffer 12, the processing is performed on<br>
data already stored in the second buffer 14. When the<br>
first buffer 12 is filled, the switch S1 is switched to<br>
the second buffer 14 and the switch S2 is switched to the<br>
first buffer 12. The switches S1 and S2 switch back and<br>
forth every time a buffer is filled. Buffers 12 and 14<br>
are sized to each hold one (1) second worth of data.<br>
A band-pass filter 16 processes the data from buffer<br>
12 or 14 and passes the filtered data to be analyzed by<br>
the algorithms 18 as shown in Fig. 1. The algorithms 18<br>
are the three detection algorithms, namely, wavelet<br>
based, higher order statistics based and neural network<br>
based, described in the '270 application	<br>
Even though the processor time-step is equal to 32<br>
cycles/second the results are refreshed every second <br>
since it takes one second to process a buffer worth of<br>
data.<br>
Each of the algorithms 18 in their format described<br>
in the '270 application cover ten seconds worth of data.<br>
Since it is not possible in the present invention to<br>
implement the algorithms in that format, each of the<br>
algorithms 18 are modified to process one second worth of<br>
data at a time.<br>
A circular buffering system 20, which is illustrated<br>
in Fig. 2, is connected to the output of algorithms 18 to<br>
obtain the ten seconds of data that would be obtained<br>
from each algorithm 18. While Fig. 2 shows only one<br>
system 20 connected to the output of algorithms 18, those<br>
of ordinary skill in the art would appreciate that there<br>
is a system 20 for each of the algorithms.<br>
System 20, as is shown in Fig. 2, removes the first<br>
value for each 10th value added. The algorithm equations<br>
were modified to compensate for the errors introduced by<br>
the non-linearity due to chopping of the ten-second<br>
interval. The data acquired for each second is processed<br>
and used as an initial condition to compute the<br><br>
subsequent one-second data. The results are stored in a<br>
ten-second circular buffer used also as accumulator.<br>
The modifications to the algorithms are as follows:<br>
a.	the calculation is performed for the 1st one<br>
second interval and the output is stored as the<br>
accumulator first value;<br>
b.	the calculated output is also used as the<br>
initial input to calculate the 2nd one second interval<br>
and the output is stored as the second accumulator value;<br>
and<br>
c.	the process continues until ten seconds are<br>
reached.<br>
The eleventh one second is considered as the first,<br>
second and the process is repeated as above. At any<br>
given time the total output is the summation of the ten<br>
buffer values.<br>
In accordance with the present: invention there is a<br>
fixed point implementation of each of the three high<br>
impedance fault detection algorithms. The algorithms<br>
were initially developed using floating-point arithmetic<br>
to verify and validate the concept then translated to<br>
fixed-point arithmetic for final implementation. Fixed-<br>
point digital signal processors are suitable for<br>
implementing a large volume of products economically<br>
because they are much cheaper, consume less power and<br>
execute faster than signal processors containing<br>
floating-point arithmetic units.<br>
The code for each algorithm was implemented on a<br>
suitable central processing unit such as for example the<br>
Motorola ColdFire 5307 CPU with a clock speed of 66 MHz<br>
and a unified cache of 64 KB. The data acquisition is<br>
performed at a rate of 32 samples per second and the<br>
processing of the HIF algorithms is performed once per<br>
second in the highest priority task which is interrupted<br>
every 4.1ms to perform data transfer from the DSP and<br>
protection algorithms.<br><br>
Results from floating-point and fixed-point<br>
simulations were compared and showed no precision lost<br>
during the conversion.<br>
It is to be understood that the description of the<br>
preferred embodiment (s) ±s (are) intended to be only<br>
illustrative, rather than exhaustive, of the present<br>
invention. Those of ordinary skill will be able to make<br>
certain additions, deletions, and/or modifications to the<br>
embodiment(s) of the disclosed subject matter without<br>
departing from the spirit of the invention or its scope,<br>
as defined by the appended claims.<br><br>
