FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
acid-amylase and other enzymes such as cellulase, pectinase, lipase, xylanase, protease, etc during manufacture of nev.'fabrics,<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The processing of f;aljric, such as cellulosic material, into material ready for garment manufacture involves seveic steps: spinning of the fiber into a yarn; construction of woven or knit fabric from the yarn; and subsequent preparation, dyeing and finishing operations. The preparation process^ which may involve desizing (for woven goods), scouring, and bleaching, produces a labric suitable for dyeing or finishing.<br>
WO 2006/(302034 (Novozymes) describes simultaneous desizing and scouring process comprising treating fabric with an alkanne alpha-amylase and an alkaline scouring enzyme. Alkaline alpha-amylases are used as auxiliaries in desizing processes to facilitate the removal of starch-containing size which has served as a protective coating on yarns during weaving.<br>
Complete removal of the size coating after weaving is important to ensure optimum results in ihe subsequent p'ocesses in which the fabric is generally scoured, bleached, dyed and/or printed.<br>
After the desizing step it is often desirable to include a demineralization step in order to remove metal ions such as Mn'^ Fe'VPe^'^'Cu^^etc., which - if present on the fabric -may result in an uneven t:)Ieaching in a later process step or might even make pin-holes in the bleached fabric. Demiieraiization is typically accomplished by acid precipitation and typically involves addition of acids such as acetic acid or sulphuric acid.<br>
There is a need for improved processes for simultaneous desizing combined with other fabric treatment steps, such as combined desizing and scouring, combined desizing and biopolishing, combined desizing and abrasion and combined desizing and carbonizing etc.<br>
 <br>

The present inventcrs have found that when carrying out a simultaneously desizing and bioscoLiring procfiss o^ ihe inventior, as defined in 'he claims, no demineraiization is needed. The demine-i^izEitio^- t3!
processes involving an acid desizing step and a demineraiization step a pH adjusting step is avoided. Another ad\'antage of the invention is that process time is saved/reduced as desizing, oioscouiing end derninerElization may be carried out simultaneously. Even if the combined desizing ana bioscouring and demineraiization are not carried out as a one step process, i.e., simultaneously, costs, of, e.g., acids and manpower for adding acid(3) are saved/reduced as the pH adiustmert step between the traditional acid desizing step and the demineraiization step is avoided. As compared to simultaneous desizing and bioscouring under alkaline conditions, simultaneous desizing and bioscouring under acid conditions can remove the demineral 2BtiDn at the s.ame time without additional demineralising procedure.<br>
In the context of thi invention, the term "treatment" means the combination of enzymes that provide facili;-ied processing, such as combined desizing and scouring, combined desizing and biopolishing, combined desizing and abrasion: etc.<br>
In the context cf the invention, the term "biopolishing" is a specific treatmen: of the yarn surface v/hich improves fabric quality with respect to handle and appearance without loss of fabric vi/ettabiliy. The most important effects of biopolishing can be characterised by less fuzz and pilling, increaseo goss/luster, improve-" ;aonc hanale, inceased jjrabie softness and improved wster absorbency.<br>
In conte.xt of the nvention, the term "combined" or "combination" means that the combined process steps, c the coribination is carried out sequentially or simultaneously in one bath {i.e., same Seating solution). In a preferred embodiment the comoined process or the combination is carried cut simultaneously in one bath {i.e., same treating solution).<br>
In context of the inv-ention the term "fabric" is used interchangeable with the term "textile" and mean?; in contrast to "used" laundry fabric, newly manufactured, preferably undyed, fabrics, garments, fibres, yarns or other types of processed fabrics. Fabrics can be constructed from fibers by weaving, knitting or non-woven operations. Weaving and knitting require yarn as the input whereas the non-woven fabric is the result of random bonding of fibers (paper can be thought of as non-woven).<br>
 <br>
Woven fabric s corisiructed by v^'eaving "filling" or weft yarns between warp yarns stretched in rhe longi.iidincil iiiirection on the loom. The wrap yarns must be sized before weaving in orcer to luDricale and protect them from abrasion at the high speed insenion of the filling yams dunnci weaving. Th-5 filling yarn can be woven through the warp yarns in a "over one - under the next" la shier (plain weave) or by "over one - under two" (twill) or any other myriad of perrnuta:ions. Strength, texture and pattern are related not only to the type/quality of the yarn bjt also the t\'pe of weave. Generally, dresses, shirts, pants<br>
jv     '   —<br>
Knitting Is forrr: ig a fadric by joining together interlocking loops of yarn. As opposed to weaving, which is :;ons:ructed from two types of yarn and has many "ends", knitted fabric is produced from a single continuDus strand of yarn. As with weaving, there are many different ways to loop varn together and the final fabric properties are dependent both upon the yarn and the type of knit. Underwear, sweaters, socks, sport shirts, sweat shirts, etc. are derived from knit fabrics.<br>
Non-woven fal)rics are sheets of fabric made by bonding and/or interlocking fibers and filaments by rnecharical, thermal, chemical or solvent mediated processes. The resultant fabric can oe in the form of web-like structures, laminates or films. Typical examples are dispoEciblo t;;;;by d:apers, towels, wipes, surgical gowns, fibers for the "environmental friendly" fashion, filler media, bedding, roofing materials, backing for two-dimensioi'al fabrics arid frany others.<br>
According to the in/cintion, ths process may be applied to any sized fabric known in the art (woven, knitted, oi nonv/oven). The process is applied to newly manufactured sized fabric, as opposed to usee and/Dr soileci fabric to be cieanen during laundry washing, in an embodiment the fatv c s ma:.-; cf fbres c 'aturai a^a or n-an-made ir-gln. in a &gt; itner embodimtent the fabnc is riade of fibres Irom animal origir;. In particular, the process of the invention may be appi ed to cellulose-containing or cellulosic fabrics, such as cotton, viscose, rayon, ramie, Inen, cc-llulcs3 acetate, denim, lyocell (Te: cei™, e.g., produced by Courtaulds Fibers), or mixtures thereof, or mixtures of any of these fibers together with synthetic fibres [e.g., polyester, polyamide, acrylic, or polyurethane, nvlon, po!y(ethylene terephthalate) or poly(lactic acid) or other natural fibers, such as wool and silk., such as viscose/cotton blends, lyocell/cotton blends^ \/i3cose/wool blends, lyocell/wool blends, cotton/wool blends; flax (linen), ramie and other fabrics bas.ed on cellulose fibers, including all blends of cellulosic fibers with other fibers such as wool, polyamide, acrylic and polyester fibers, e.g., viscose/cotton/polyesler blends, wool/cotton/polyester blends, flax/cotton blends etc. The process may also be used on synthetic fabric, e.g., consisting of essentially 100% polyester.<br>
 <br>
polyamide, nylon, resiiectivelv Tiie lerm "wool," means any commercially useful animal hair product 'or example, woo iron sheep, camel, rabbit, goat, lama, and knowr as merino wool, Shetland v\/ool i^astimere vvocil, alpaca wool, mohair, etc. and includes wool fiber and animal hair. The process of trie invention can be used with wool or animal hair material in the form of top, fiber, varn, DI woven cr knitted fabric.<br>
The alpha-amyiase jsed in CK ;ordance with the process of the invention may be any acid alpha-amylase, bjt is pre-erably of either bacterial or fungal origin,<br>
strain of Aspergillus, Rni/.omucor or Meripillus.<br>
The term "acid alp:ia-amylase means an alpha-amylase (E.G. 3.2.1.1) which has an optimum activity at a pH m fie rani^e of 1 to 7, preferably from 1 to 5 at a temperature of 50^C.<br>
The term "des 2incr' is intended to be understood in a conventional manner, ;.e . the degradation and/or renovE.I of sizing agents from fabric, such as warp yarns in a \woven fabric.<br>
The term "fabric containing starch or starch derivatives" is intended to indicate any type of fabric, in partcular ivoven fabric prepared from a cellulose-containing material, containing starch or starch derivatives. The fabric is normally undyed and made cf cotton, viscose, flax, and the like, tie main part of the starch or starch derivatives preser on the fabric is normally size with .v-lich the yarns, normally warp yarns, have been coated prior to weaving.<br>
The term "carboh/drate-binding module (CBM)", or as often referred to a "carbohydrate-binding domain (CBD)', is a polypeptide amino acid sequence which binds oreferentially to a poly- or oligosac;naride (carbohydrate), frequently - but not necessarily exclusively - 1c a water-insoluble (including crystalline) form thereof.<br>
Even if not specifically mentioned in connection with the process of the invention, it is to be understood that the en2:yme(s) or agent(s) is(are) used in an "effective amount". The term "effective amount" means an amount of, e.g., alpha-amylase that is capable of providing the desired effeo:, i.e., desizing of the fabric, as compared to a fabric which has not been treated v/ith said enz/me(s).<br>
DETAILED DISCLOSURE: OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present in\'ention is directed towards providing a process of desizing a sized fabric during manufaciire cf especially new fabrics.<br>
 <br>
The desiz-nci stepi o' the invention is in a preferred embodiment followed by a scounng step, preferable s.n enzymatic scouring step, preferably with a scouring enzyme such as 6. pectinase, o.g., si i.'ectate lyase, a lipase, a protease, or combination thereof, and a bleaching step, prelerably iivoiving bleaching with hydrogen peroxide and/or a hyorogen peroxide generating cgent. F^^levant scouring processes are described in U.S. Patent No. 5,578,489, U.S. F^atent No. 5.912,407, and U.S. Patent No. 6,630,342. Releva.nt bleach processes are descnbed in U.S. Patent No. 5.851,233. U.S. Patent No. 5.752.980, and U.S.<br>
WO 2003/002810 (Novozymes) and WO 2003/002705 (Novozymes).<br>
According to tne present invention, fabric may be desized and demineralized simultaneously in the sarre aciueous treating solution (i.e., one bath) or subsequently in the same or two separate treating solutions (i.e., one or two baths). In a preferred embodiment the desizing and den-iinoralization are carried out simultaneously in the same treating solution {i.e., one batn). Ttie process of the invention may be carried out using traditional sizing/desizing equipment, e.g., ps.d systems, J-boxes, jets, jiggers, etc. In general, no additional process equipment is neede.'d.<br>
According to tne indention simultaneous desizing and demineralization are carried Dut by incubating ::;izi3d fabri;; in an aqueous treating solution having a pH in the range between 1 and 7 whi:;h aciueous treating solution comprises an acid alpha-amylase. In a preferred embodimenv the pH during incubation is in the range between 1 and 4, especially Detween pH 2 and 4,<br>
Woven goods are the prevalent form of fabric construction. The weaN'ing process lemands a "sizing" ol the A'arp yarn to protect it from abrasion. Starches, unmodified and nodified, polyvinyl accno. (PVA), carboxy methyl cellulose (CMC), waxes and acrylic )inders, and mixtures thereof, are examples of typically used sizing agents. The sizing igent may according to the invention be a starch-based or starch derivative-based sizing igent, but may also contain one or more non-starch or starch derivative-based sizing igents. The sizing acent(s) c.re in general removed after the weaving process as the first ;tep in preparing the vwver goods.<br>
One or more other agents including stabilizers, surfactants wetting agents, iispersing agent, seqjestering agents and emulsifying agents, or mixtures thereof, may be iresent during a desi2-.ing process of tne invention. The sized fabric is allowed to incubate in ne aqueous treating solution for a .sufficiently long period of time to accomplish desizing of ne sized fabric. The Dptimal period is dependent upon the type of processing regime and le temperature and can vary from about 15 minutes to several days, e.g., 48 hours. A<br>
 <br>
process of the inven-.ic.n ^s [jreferably earned out at a temperature in the range from 5 to 90°C, in particular 20 o 9i)' C deperdent on the processing regime.<br>
The processinc racjime can be eithei batch or continuous with the fabric being contacted by the aquec^us t eating stream in open width or rope form.<br>
Continuous opsraticrs may use a saturator whereby an approximate equal weight of treating solution per vveiciht of fabric is applied to the fabhc, follovved by a heated dwell chamber where the cl'emiL;&amp;; reaction takes place. A washing section then Drepa-es the<br>
and resulting dyeability, tiie desizing enzyme(s) and other agents must be thoroughly removed.<br>
Batch process;'33 may take place in one bath (treating solution) whereby the fabric is contacted with, e.g., approximately 8-15 times its weight of aqueous treating solution. After an incubatior period, the aqueous 'Teating solution is drained, the fabric is rinsed, and the next processing £;tep is initialed. Discontinuous PB-processes {i.e., pad-batch processes) involves a saturato; \i\\-erehy an approximate equal weight of aqueous treating solution per weight of fabhc is app ied to the fabric, followed by a dwell pehod, which in the case of CPB-process (i.e., cold paj-batcl" process) miight be one or more days. For instance, a CPB-process may be carrii^d out at betw(;en 20-40°C for 8-24 hours or more at a pH in the range between 1 and 7, pr^feral'jly at a pH in the range between around 1 and 4, especially between pH 2 and 4. Fut1h9r, a F^B process may be earned out at between 40-90X for 1-6 hours at a pH in the range between around 1 and 7, preferably between around pH 1 and 5, more preferably betvi/E^en ' and 4, especially between pH 2 and 4.<br>

Carbohydrate-binding domain<br>
A carbohydrate-binding domains (CBD), or as often referred to, a carbohydrate-binding modules (CB^/I), is a polypeptide amino acid sequence which binds preferentially to<br>
 <br>
a poly- or oligosacchcride icarbohyjrate), frequently - but not necessarily exclusively - to a water-insoluble (inducing c-y;-;talline) form thereof.<br>
CBDi ierived 7om .starch de^grading enzymes are often referred to as starch-binding domains (SBD) or stsircf-lsirding inodules (SBM). SBDs are CBDs which may occur in certain amylolytic eni'ytres. such as certain glucoamylases, or in enzymes such as cyclodextrin glucaroransferases, or in alpha-amylases. Likewise, other sub-clas: 3S of CBDs would embraco, eg., cellulcse-binding domains (CBDs fron-; cellulolytic enzymes),<br>
(CBDs which typically occur in xylanases), mannan-binding domains (CBDs which t/oically occur in mannanases).<br>
CBDs are fouiicl as irtsgral parts of large polypeptides or proteins consisting :A two or more polypeptide amino acid sequence regions, especially in hydrolytic enzymes (hydrolases) which typical y complse a catalytic domain containing the active site for substrate hydrolysis and a carbohydrate-binding domain (CBD) for binding to the carbohydrate substrate in question SJuch enzymes can comprise more than one catalytic domain and one, tuo or three CBDs, and optionally further comprise one or more polypeptide amino acid secuence regions linking the CBD(s) with the catalytic domain(s), a region of the laner tyize usually being denoted a "linker". Examples of hydrolytic enzymes comprising a CBD - ;;om5 of whicti tiave already been mentioned above - are cellulases, xylanases, rnannanas'r'S, aia.Dinofuranosidases, acetylesterases and chitinases. CBDs have also been found in agae, e.g., in the re)d alga Porphyra purpurea in the form of a non-hydrolytic polysaccharider-binding protein.<br>
In proteins/polypeplides in which CBDs occur (e.g., enzymes, typically hydrolytic enzymes), a CBD nay be located a! the N or C terminus or at an interna! position.<br>
That part of a polypeptide or protein (e.g., hydrolytic enzyme) which constitutes a CBD per se typically :onsi:5ls of miore than about 30 and less than about 250 amino acid residues.<br>

In the present content, the term "cellulase or "cellulolytic enzyme" refers to an enzyme, v^/hich catary5;es the cegradation of cellulose to glucose, ceilobiose, triose and other cellooligosaccharides. Cellulose is a polymer of glucose linked by beta-1,4-glucosidic bonds. Cellulose chains form lumerous irrra- and intermolecular hydrogen bonds, which result in the formation of insoluble cellulose microfibhis. Microbial hydrolysis of cellulose to glucose<br>
 <br>
involves the foliowinci th-ee major classes of cellulases endo-1,4-beta-glucanases (EC 3.2.1.4), which claa'v'o bet«:-'L4-glucosidic links randomly throughout cellulose molecules; cellobiohvdrolases {ciC 3.2.1.91) (sxoglucanases), which digest cellulose fron the nonreducing end; and beta-glucosida&amp;es (EC 3.2.1.21), which hydrolyse cellobiose and low-molecular-mass celloaaxtn-iE; to release glucose. Most cellulases consist of a cellulose-binding dorT,ain (CBD; and a caialylic domain (CD) separated by a linker rich in proline and hydroxy arnrc acid rosidj(5S. In -fo specification and claims, the term "endogiucanese" is<br>

The starch &amp;ize resi jue is determined visually by comparing an iodine stained fabric<br>
stain. The iodine stain sDlurion is made by dissolving 10 g Ki in 10 ml water, add 0.635 g I2 and 200 mL ethanci in deioni.-zec! water to make total 1 L solution. A fabric sample is cut and immersed in the iodine solution for 60 seconds and rinsed in deionized water for about 5 seconds. The fabric sample is rated by at least two professionals after excess water in the sample is pressed out. An average number is given. Method and standard scales obtainable from Verbaro TfiiGEWA, Karlstrasse 21, Frankfurt a.M., Germany.<br>
The pectin residue on fabri:; iwas determined quantitatively. The principle is that ruthenium red binds to polyanionio compounds like unmethylated pectin. The level of pectin on the fabric is proportional to the concentration of ruthenium red on the cotton fabric which is linearly proportional to Ku belka-Munk function {i.e., K/S). The coloi reflectance (R) of ruthenium red E;tained fabric was measured at 540nm (Macbeth colorimeter. Model # CE-7000) and automatically calculated into a K/S value by:<br>
1
The "/o pecTin 'erovaS was caiculatea using the following formula: %-pectin removal = - % Res. Pectin = 1- 100 * (K/S - K/So)/(K/Sioo- K/So) where K/S100 was froiTi fabrc with 100% pectin, typically original untreated fabric, while K/So was from the fabric vvilh 0% residual pectin, typically heavily scoured and bleached fabric. Based on information from John H. Luft and described in an article "Ruthenium red and Violet 1. Chemistry" 1971 .he stain solution was prepared by dissolving 0.2 g/l ruthenium red, 1.0 g/l ammonium chloride, 2.5 ml/I 28% ammonium hydroxide solution, 1.0 g/l Silwet L-77, and 1.0 g/l Tergitol 15-S-12 in distilled water to make total liter solution. The solution was made daily before use. During staining, 100 mL dye solution was used for 1 gram of fabric. The fabric sv&gt;/atches were incubated in ruthenium red solution for 15 minutes at room temperature. The sv/atci was rinsed in a strainer and then hnsed in distilled water (100 ml/1 gram fabric) at 60"C for 10 minutes. The color reflectance was measured after dry.<br>

The time required for the specular reflection of the water drop to disappear vvas ineasLi-ed and -ecorded as wetting time.<br>
The wicking iieign'i of "e&gt;niies is one of the indicators for absorbency. Cut a rectangular fabric swia:ch 25 cm (warp and weft direction) X 4 cm. If the sample is not available in this size ci (ist. adjust the method to fit the sample. Using a waterproof/dye-proof pen, draw a line across ihe top of the sample 1.5 cm from the top of the swatch and 3 cm from the bottom o1 the .sample. (Draw a line across the sample 19 cm from the bottom of the swatch. Attacli a pap'or clamp with a weight to the bottom of the fabric. Place the top of the swatch in the csnter of the thermometer clamp, so that the line is at the bottom of the clamp. Fill a beal-.er about half vv-ay (at least 5 cm above bottom of glass) with 1 g/L dye solution {e.g., reactivfi blue). Adjusi the clamp with the swatch until the surface of the dye solution i:; even with tie line at the bottom of the fabric. Start the timer as soon as the swatch is in place.

Example 11<br>
A 100% cc'tton fabric (270 g/m") was from Boras Wafveri Kungsfors AB, Sweden. It was made in 2003 wiih CuDper 3/1 construction. The fabric contained 28 thread/cm warp yarn and 14 thread/cm weft yarn. The warp yarn has Ne 11 and the weft has Ne 8. Both yarns were open end. The: diy size^ pick up on the warp yarn was 8%. The size contained mainly Kollotex 5, Sovitose XO, and beef tallow wax with emulsifier. Kollotex 5 is a low viscous potalo starch esster. Soiviose XO is a high viscous starch ether with DS about 0.07.    Fabric swatches were cut to about 25 g each.<br>
Buffer pH 3 was nacle by dissolving 11.53 g 85% phosphoric acid in 4.5 liter pure water, titrating v\/ith 5 M NaOH to p-i 2.95, then adding water to 5 liter. After adding 2 g/l nonionic surfactant t,a 'V9":tin3 ager;;) in the buffer, the buffer pH was measured as 3.05 at 25°C.   The close of enzymes was added as listed in table 6.<br>
The desizing treatment was conducted in a Lab-o-mat (Werner Mathis). A 250 mL buffer solution was accied in each beaker. A given amount of alpha-amylase enzyme was added. One fabric swatch (25 g) was placed in each beaker. The beaker was closed and placed in the Lab-o-n',-t. Beakers were heated at 5°0/min to 50°C by an infrared heating system equipped v\/i1hin the Lab-o-miat. Beakers were rotated at 30 rpm, 50'C for 45 minutes. After the enizyme treatment, the fabric swatch was sequentially washed with water in the same beake'^ ttiree times at 95, 75, and 40-C, respectively.<br>
After dry overnight in air, the fabric swatch was stained with an iodine solution. The stained fabric sample was visually compared to TEGEWA standard photos with 1-9 scale where 1 is dark and 9 has no colcr stain.   Thus higher number indicates a better starch<br>
 <br>
removal.   The visusi! evaiua   &gt;r] WES done by at least three professionals and an average TEGEW/i value was civen Ci each faoric sample.   The results are shown in Table 6.<br>
The residue of rnelal ons on fabric was also evaluated. The fabric was first cut through 1 mm sievfr with a Thomas-Wiley mill. Fabric mash 4.00 (+/-0.01) g was mixed with 80 mL 1 g/L EDTA solution. The rrix';ure was incubated at 70-C and 200 rpm in a shaker (new Bru iswick Sciei'tfi: Co, Inc, Series 25) for 15 hours. After cooled down for about 30 minutes, the mi^^ture was csnlrifuged at 2500 rpm at 20'C for 10 minutes. The supernatant<br>
