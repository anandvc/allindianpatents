TITLE OF INVENTION<br><br>
A method for reducing wrinkle formation in a LAUNDRY Process.<br><br><br><br><br>
2. HINDUSTAN LEVER LIMITED, Hindustan Lever House, 165/166, Bacioay Reclamation, Mumbai - 400 020, Maharashtra, India, a company incorporated under the Companies Act, 1913<br><br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention <br>
and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br>
Laundry Treatment for Fabrics<br>
Technical Field<br>
5  The present invention relates to a method of reducing wrinkle formation in a laundry process.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
10  Wrinkles or creases in textile fabrics are caused by bending and folding of textiles, which place textiles under a mixture of tension and compression forces.  Particularly with cellulosic materials, hydrogen boning between cellulose fibres contributes to keeping these wrinkles in place.  The<br>
15  resistance of fabrics against wrinkling depends, amongst<br>
other things, on the yarn and fibre bending resistance and the recovery once the force has been released.<br>
Wrinkles or creases in textile fabrics give fabrics an 20  unwanted appearance.  Many people do not like the labour involved in removing these unwanted wrinkles.<br>
Easy iron or non-iron garments can be obtained by finishing the garments with poly functional internal cross-linkers<br>
25  such as dimethyolol dihydroxy ethylene urea (DMDHEU) which react inside the fibre with cellulose to form more resilient fibres and yarns.  However, cross-linkers such as DMDHEU carry the risk of formaldehyde release.  An alternative formaldehyde-free cross-linker is butyl-1,2,3,4-<br>
30  tetracarboxylic acid.  A disadvantage of all the<br>
aforementioned cross-linkers is that a curing step is needed<br><br><br>
for the cross-linking reaction, making this method less suitable for a laundry process.<br>
Adhesive polymers are also claimed to provide a wrinkle 5  benefit (e.g. WO 9955814 and WO 9955951, in the name of<br>
Procter &amp; Gamble).  However, the delivery of these materials onto textiles is not optimal under wash conditions.<br>
The inventors have sought methods of reducing wrinkle 10  formation during laundry processes and providing laundered fabrics with improved ironability.<br>
The present inventors have discovered that certain fabric rebuild materials which undergo a chemical change during a<br>
15  laundry process to increase their affinity for fabric surprisingly reduce the formation of wrinkles during a laundry process.  It is also found that wrinkles that are formed can be removed with less effort, leading to improved ironability.<br>
20<br>
The fabric rebuild agents used are themselves the subject of our patent co-pending application- WO4 00/18860'.  This patent application describes a wide general class of fabric rebuild agents which can rebuild fabric during a laundry operation.<br>
25  The present inventors have discovered that a relatively<br>
small class of the rebuild agents described in the patent application will provide a surprisingly good anti-wrinkle benefit.<br>
30  WO-A-99/14245 discloses laundry detergent compositions<br>
containing cellulosic based polymers to provide appearance<br><br>
and integrity benefits to fabrics.  These polymers are cellulosic polymers in which the saccharide rings have pendant oxygen atoms to which substituents 4R' are bonded, i.e. they are attached to the rings via an ether linkage.<br>
  The groups 'R' can be hydrogen, lower alkyl or alkylene linkages terminated by carboxylic acid, ester or amide groups.  Optionally, up to five alkyleneoxy groups may be interspersed between the groups are the respective oxygen atom. At least some of these groups may undergo a chemical .0  change such as hydrolysis, in the wash liquor.  However no such change would result in an increased affinity for the fabric.  On the contrary, because the "ester" group is configured with the carbonyl group closer to the polysaccharide than the oxygen atom (i.e. esters of<br>
  carboxyalkyl groups), any hydrolysis will result in free acid substituents which will actually result in an increase in solubility and therefore, a decrease in affinity for the fabric.<br>
  WO-A-99/14295 discloses structures analogous to those described in WO-A-99/14245 but in one alternative, the substituents 'R' together with the oxygen on the saccharide ring, constitute pendant half-esters of certain dicarboxylic acids.  A single example of such a material is given.  The<br>
  dicarboxylic acid half-esters would tend to hydrolyse in the wash liquor and thereby increase affinity of the material for a cotton fabric.  However, first, this mechanism of action or behaviour is not mentioned.  Second, the hydrolysis rate of such dicarboxylic acids half esters is<br>
  not as great as that of esters of monocarboxylic acids (which are not disclosed or claimed in WO-A-99/14295) .<br><br>
Third, the degree of substitution for this variant is specified as being from 0.001 to 0.1.  This is so low as to make the enhancement of fabric affinity too low to be worthwhile for this mechanism of action.  Fourth, the 5  structures described and claimed insofar as they have such half ester substituents, must also have substituents of the type which are carboxyalkyl groups or esters thereof, i.e. of the type also described in WO-A-99/14245.  In the latter (ester) case, these would hydrolyse to the free acid form.<br>
10  The degree of substitution of the latter (0.2 to 2) is<br>
considerably higher than for the half-ester groups and the resultant increase in solubility would easily negate any enhanced affinity for the fabric by hydrolysis of the half-ester groups.<br>
15<br>
WO 99/14295 is addressed to improving the overall appearance of fabrics during the wash.  In particular, it relates to methods of reducing the formation of lint, fuzz or pills and dye loss.  There is no reference to wrinkle reduction.<br>
20<br>
Definition of the Invention<br>
Thus the present invention provides a method of reducing wrinkle formation in a laundry process, comprising using a<br>
25  laundry treatment composition comprising a water-soluble or water-dispersible rebuild agent for deposition onto a fabric during the laundry process wherein the rebuild agent undergoes during the laundry process, a chemical change by which change the affinity of the rebuild agent for the<br>
30  fabric is increased, wherein the chemical change occurs in or to acetate groups covalently bonded to be pendant on a<br><br>
polymeric backbone of the rebuild agent and which backbone comprises cellulose units or other p-1,4 linked polysaccharide units, the average degree of substitution of the acetate groups pendant on the saccharide rings of the 5  backbone being from 0.55 to 0.70.<br>
Throughout this specification, "average degree of substitution" refers to the number of substituted pendant groups per saccharide ring, averaged over all saccharide 10  rings of the rebuild agent.  Each saccharide ring prior to substitution has three -OH groups and therefore, an average degree of substitution of 3 means that each of these groups on all molecules of the sample, bears a substituent.<br>
15  The present invention further provides the use of a fabric rebuild agent which comprises a polymeric backbone, comprising cellulose units or other (3-1,4 linked polysaccharide units, with acetate groups covalently bonded to the polymeric backbone, the average degree of<br>
  substitution of the acetate groups pendant on the saccharide rings of the backbone being 0.55-0.70, to reduce wrinkle formation in a laundry process.<br>
The exact mechanism by which any of these rebuild agents 25  exert their effect is not fully understood.<br>
Without being bound by any particular theory or explanation, the inventors have conjectured that the mechanism of deposition is as follows.<br><br>
Cellulose is substantially insoluble in water.  Attachment of the acetate groups causes disruption of the hydrogen bonding between rings of the cellulose chain, thus increasing water solubility or dispersibility.  In the 5  treatment liquor, it is believed that the acetate groups are hydrolysed, causing the affinity for the fabric to increase and the polymer to be deposited on the fabric.  It is believed that the deposited cellulose polymer reinforces the textile fibres and increases their resistance to wrinkling. 10  Further, it is believed that the deposited polymer layer can act as an excellent ironing aid.  Accordingly, less iron drag is obtained.<br>
The fabric rebuild polymer used in the present invention 15  does not adversely interact with surfactants and can be absorbed and/or deposited from the wash in an effective manner.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention. 20<br>
The Rebuild Agent<br>
The rebuild agent material used in the present invention is water-soluble or water-dispersible in nature. 25<br>
The weight average molecular weight (M„) of the rebuild agent (as determined by GPC) is preferably from 5,000 to 50,000, especially from 10,000 to 20,000.<br><br>
By water-soluble, as used herein, what is meant is that the material forms an isotropic solution on addition to water or another aqueous solution.<br>
5  By water-dispersible, as used herein, what is meant is that the material forms a finely divided suspension on addition to water or another aqueous solution.  Preferably though, the term "water-dispersible" means that the material, in water at pH 7 and at 25°C, produces a solution or a 10  dispersion having long-term stability.<br>
By an increase in the affinity of the material for the fabric upon a chemical change, what is meant is that at some time during the laundry process, the amount of material that 15  has been deposited is greater when the- chemical change is occurring or has occurred, compared to when the chemical change has not occurred and is not occurring, or is occurring more slowly, the comparison being made with all conditions being equal except for that change in the<br>
2	0  conditions which is necessary to affect the rate of chemical<br>
change.<br>
Deposition includes adsorption, cocrystallisation, entrapment and/or adhesion. 25<br>
The Polymeric Backbone<br>
The polymeric backbone is cellulose or a cellulose derivative or a another p-l,4-linked polysaccharide having<br>
3	0  an affinity for cellulose, such as mannan and glucomannan.<br><br>
The polysaccharide may be straight or branched.  Many naturally occurring polysaccharides have at least some degree of branching, or at any rate, at least some saccharide rings are in the form of pendant side groups (and 5  therefore are not in themselves counted in the degree of substitution) on a main polysaccharide backbone.<br>
A polysaccharide comprises a plurality of saccharide rings, which have pendant hydroxyl groups.  The "average degree of<br>
10  substitution" means the average number of acetate groups per saccharide ring for the totality of polysaccharide molecules in the sample and is determined for all saccharide rings whether they form part of a linear backbone or are themselves, pendant side groups in the polysaccharide.<br>
15<br>
Other polymeric backbones suitable as according to the present invention include those described in Hydrocolloid Applications, A. Nussinswitch, Blackie 1997.<br>
20  Pendant Groups which undergo the Chemical Change<br>
The chemical"change, which causes the increased fabric affinity, is preferably hydrolysis, perhydrolysis or bond-cleavage, optionally "catalysed by an enzyme or another 25  catalyst.  However, preferably this change is not merely protonation or deprotonation, i.e. a pH induced effect.<br>
Preferred for use in the invention are cellulosic polymers of formula (I):-<br><br><br>
CD<br><br>
where the groups R are H or CH3CO.<br>
5  Other Fibre Rebuild Polymers<br>
Compositions used in the present invention may include other fibre rebuild polymers, to provide a fabric rebuild benefit during the wash, as described in PCT/EP99/07422.  These polymers are ones which undergo, during the laundry process, a chemical change by which the affinity of the rebuild agent for the fabric is increased, the chemical change resulting in the loss or modification of one or more groups covalently bonded to be pendant to polymeric backbone of the rebuild agent.  A f.i.rst. class, of„ fabric rebuild agents comprises, groups covalently bonded to the polymeric backbone via an ester linkage, the ester-linked groups being selected from monocarboxylic acid esters.  This class of polymer preferably has formula (II):<br><br><br>
(H)<br><br>
wherein at least one or more R' groups of the polymer are independently selected from groups of formulae:-<br><br>
Rl—C—<br>
II O<br><br>
Rl—0-C—<br>
II<br>
o<br><br><br><br>
R2, N-C—<br>
2        II O<br><br>
Ri—C-C—<br>
II     II<br>
o o<br><br>
10  wherein each R1 is independently selected from C^o<br>
(preferably Ci.s)alkyl, C2.2o (preferably C2-6) alkenyl (e.g. vinyl) and Cs.7 aryl (e.g. phenyl) any of which is optionally substituted by one or more substituents independently selected from Ci-4 alkyl, Ci-i2 (preferably Ci-4) alkoxy,<br>
15  hydroxy1, vinyl and phenyl groups;  and<br>
each R2 is independently hydrogen or a group R1 as hereinbefore defined.<br>
20 . . In...a.. second_.class of fabric rebuild polymer which may be<br>
used in compositions of the present invention, the polymeric<br><br>
backbone comprises cellulose units or other p-1, 4 linked polysaccharide units, the average degree of substitution of the total of all groups pendant on the saccharide rings of the backbone being from 0.3-3.0, preferably 0.4-1.0, more 5  preferably 0.5-0.75, most preferably from 0.6-0.7.<br>
Preferred fabric rebuild agents of this second class are cellulosic polymers of formula (III):-<br><br><br>
10<br><br>
(m)<br><br>
wherein at least one or more R" groups of the polymer are independently selected from groups of formulae:-<br><br><br>
	 C— CH2 —   C	CH2<br>
wherein each R1 is independently selected from C1-20 (preferably Cx.6)   alkyl, c2-20 (preferably C2.6) alkenyl (e.g. vinyl) and C5-7 aryl (e.g. phenyl) any of which is optionally substituted by one or more substituents independently selected from Ci-4 alkyl, d-12 (preferably Ci-4) alkoxy, hydroxyl, vinyl and phenyl groups;<br>
each R2 is independently selected from hydrogen and groups R1 as hereinbefore defined;<br><br>
R3 is a bond or is selected from Ci.4 alkylene, C2.4 alkenylene and C5-7 arylene (e.g. phenylene) groups, the carbon atoms in any of these being optionally substituted by one or more substituents independently selected from Ci-i2 (preferably Ci-5  4) alkoxy, vinyl, hydroxyl, halo and amine groups;<br>
each R4 is independently selected from hydrogen, counter<br>
r      v cations such as alkali metal (preferably Na) or 2 Ca or jMg,<br>
and groups R1 as hereinbefore defined;<br>
10<br>
wherein each R5 is independently selected from the group consisting of H, Ci-C20 alkyl, C5-C7 cycloalkyl, C7-C2o arylalkyl, C7-C20 alkylaryl, substituted alkyl, hydroxyalkyl, (Re) 2N-alkyl, and (R6) 3N-alkyl, where R6 is independently<br>
15  selected from the group consisting of H, C1-C20 alkyl, Cs-C7 cycloalkyl, C7-C20 arylalkyl, C7-C20 alkylaryl, aminoalkyl, alkylaminoalkyl, dialkylaminoalkyl, piperidinoalkyl, morpholinoalkyl, cycloaminoalkyl and hydroxyalkyl;<br>
2	0  groups R' which together with the oxygen atom forming the<br>
linkage to the respective saccharide ring forms an ester or hemi-ester group of a tricarboxylic- or higher polycarboxylic- or other complex acid such as citric acid, an amino acid, a synthetic amino acid analogue or a protein. 25<br>
For the avoidance of doubt, as already mentioned, in both formula (II) and formula (III) some of the R1 or R' groups may optionally have one or more structures, for example as hereinbefore described.  For example, one or more R' or R1 '<br>
3	0  groups may simply be hydrogen or an alkyl group.<br><br>
In the case of formula (III), some preferred R' groups may be independently selected from one or more of methanesulphonate, toluene sulphonate groups and hemiester groups of fumaric, malonic, itaconic, oxalic, maleic, 5  succinic, tartaric, glutamic, aspartic and malic acids.<br>
In the case of formula (II) and formula (III) , the pendant groups may be independently selected from one or more of acetate, propanoate, trifluroacetate, 2-(2-hydroxy-l-10  oxopropoxy) propanoate, lactate, glycolate, pyruvate, crotonate, isovalerate, cinnamate, formate, salicylate, carbamate, methylcarbamate, benzoate and gluconate groups.<br>
As well as the groups which undergo the chemical change, 15  pendant groups of other types may optionally be present, i.e. groups which do not undergo a chemical change to enhance fabric affinity.  Within that class of other groups is the sub-class of groups for enhancing the solubility of the rebuild agent (e.g. groups which are, or contain one or 20  more free carboxylic acid/salt and/or sulphonic acid/salt and/or sulphate groups).<br>
Examples of solubility enhancing substituents include carboxyl, sulphonyl, hydroxyl, (poly)ethyleneoxy-and/or 25  (poly)propyleneoxy-containing groups, as well as amine groups.<br>
The other pendant groups preferably constitute from 0% to 65%, more preferably from 0% to 10% (e.g. from 0% to 5%) of 30  the total number of pendant groups.  The minimum number of other pendant groups may, for example be 0.1% or 1% of the<br><br>
total.  The water-solubilising groups could comprise from 0% to 100% of those other groups but preferably from 0% to 20%, more preferably from 0% to 10%, still more preferably from 0% to 5% of the total number of other pendant groups. 5<br>
Synthetic Routes<br>
Those rebuild agents used in the present invention which are 10  not commercially available may be prepared by a number of different synthetic routes, for example:-<br>
(1) polymerisation of suitable monomers, for example, enzymatic polymerisation of saccharides, e.g. per S. Shoda, 15  &amp; S. Kobayashi, Makromol. Symp. 1995, \9_9, 179-184 or<br>
oligosaccharide synthesis by orthogonal glycosylation e.g. per H. Paulsen, Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1995, 34, 1432-1434. ;<br>
20  (2) derivatisation of a polymeric backbone (either naturally occurring, especially polysaccharides, especially beta-1,4-linked polysaccharides, especially cellulose, mannan, glucomannan, galactomannan, xyloglucan; or synthetic polymers) up to the required degree of substitution with<br>
25  acetate groups using a reagent especially acetic acid<br>
halides, acetic acid anhydride, or acetic acid) in a solvent which either dissolves the backbone, swells the backbone, or does not swell the backbone but dissolves or swells the product,-<br><br>
(3)	hydrolysis of polymer acetate down to the required<br>
degree of substitution; or<br>
(4)	a combination of any two or more of routes (1)-(3).<br>
5<br>
The degree and pattern of substitution from routes (1) or (2) may be subsequently altered by partial removal of acetate groups by hydrolysis or solvolysis or other cleavage.  Relative amounts of reactants and reaction times<br>
10  can also be used to control the degree of substitution.  In addition, or alternatively, the degree of polymerisation of the backbone may be reduced before, during, or after the derivatisation with acetate groups.  The degree of polymerisation of the backbone may be increased by further<br>
15  polymerisation or by cross linking agents before, during, or after the derivatisation step.<br>
Similar methods can be used to prepare other fibre rebuild agents which may be used in the present invention, suitably 20  modified according to the type of pendant groups which are used.<br>

25  same or different, are methyl or hydroxyethyl groups); and cationic esters (for example, choline esters).<br>
The choice of surface-active compound (surfactant), and the amount present, will depend on the intended use of the 30  detergent composition. In fabric washing compositions,<br>
different surfactant systems may be chosen, as is well known<br><br>
to the skilled formulator, for handwashing products and for products intended for use in different types of washing machine.<br>
5  The total amount of surfactant present will also depend on the intended end use and may be as high as 60 wt%, for example, in a composition for washing fabrics by hand.

Processes using high-speed mixer/granulators are disclosed, for example, in EP 340 013A, EP 367 339A, EP 390 251A and EP 420 317A (Unilever).<br>
15  Liquid detergent compositions can be prepared by admixing the essential and optional ingredients thereof in any desired order to provide compositions containing components in the requisite concentrations. Liquid compositions used in the present invention can also be in compact form which means it<br>
20  will contain a lower level of water compared to a conventional liquid detergent.<br>
The present invention will now be explained in more detail by way of the following non-limiting examples. 25<br>
Examples<br>
Example 1;  Preparation of Cellulose "Monoaeetate" 30<br>
This was prepared by the methods of WO 91/16359<br><br>
Example la<br>
340 ml of acetic acid and 60 ml of water are heated to 80°C 5  in a reactor; 63g of cellulose triacetate are dissolved in this acetic solution.  The reaction medium is mixed with 140 ml of methanol.<br>
The reaction mixture, placed in an inert atmosphere, is 10  maintained at a pressure of 6 bar at 150°C for 4 h.  A further 100 ml of methanol are added, the mixture being maintained at the same pressure and temperature for 8 h.<br>
After cooling, the cellulose acetate is precipated by the 15  addition of acetone, then recovered by filtration and washing.<br>
The degree of substitution and the molecular weight are determined by NMR analysis of the proton and gel permeation 20  chromatography.<br>
The cellulose •acetate-'thus" prepared-has "a degree of substitution of 0.55 and a molecular weight of 14,000.  The product is soluble in water. 25<br>

WE CLAIM :<br>
1.	A method of reducing wrinfcle formation in a laundry process, comprising using a laundry treatment composition comprising a water-soluble or water-dispersible rebuild agent for deposition onto a fabric during the laundry process wherein the rebuild agent undergoes during the laundry process, a chemical change by which change the affinity of the rebuild agent for the fabric is increased, the chemical change occurring in or to acetate groups covalently bonded to be pendant on a polymeric backbone of the rebuild agent and which backbone comprises cellulose units or other 6-1, 4 linked polysaccharide units, the average degree of substitution of the acetate groups pendant on the saccaharide rings of the backbone being from 0.55 to 0.70.<br>
2.	A method according claim 1, wherein the chemical change is lysis or bond-cleavage, optionally catalysed by an enzyme or another catalyst.<br>
3.	A method according to either claim 1 or claim 2, wherein the chemical change is not protonation or deprotonation.<br>
4.	A method according to any preceding claim, wherein the composition further comprises a surfactant.<br>
5.	A method according to any preceding claim, wherein the composition comprises from 0.005% to 25%, preferably from 0.01% to 10%, more preferably from 0.025% to 2.5% by weight of the rebuild agent.<br><br>
