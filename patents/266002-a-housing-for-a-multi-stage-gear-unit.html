				<td>Housing, gearing and gearing construction kit Description:<br>
The invention relates to a housing, gearing and gearing construction kit.<br>
A gearing series, that is to say a gearing construction kit, in which the torque jump is reduced by inserting intermediate special gearing sizes with an increased final centre distance, is known from DE 37 05 812 C2 (column 2, line 11-20).<br>
A gearing in which three-stage and four-stage variants may be produced using the same housing is known from DE 2 049 616. In this case, however, the location of the output shaft changes for the same input shaft.<br>
A gearing series, that is to say a gearing construction kit, which comprises multi-stage gearings comprising an angular gearing stage or alternatively a cylindrical gearing stage as an input stage, is known from the catalogue of the company PIV. On page 34 the bore pattern for a four-stage variant is shown, each bore belonging to a bearing arrangement for a shaft carrying at least one toothed part. If one or two bores are not used, two-stage variants, as shown on page 22, or three-stage variants, as shown on page 26, may be produced. The unused bore holes may be tightly closed by covers or appropriate means. In this way, the same housing may be used for different variants of the gearing series. As a result, storage space and costs, in particular storage costs, are reduced.<br>
As can be seen from the catalogue, in particular also pages 32 and 34, the bores are arranged linearly with the exception of the bore fourth from last. The last, next-to-last and third-from-last associated shaft axes thus lie in one plane.<br>
A three-stage gearing, in which an angular gearing stage is provided as input, is shown on page 86.<br>
A four-stage gearing, in which an angular gearing stage is likewise provided as input, is shown on page 90. Here, however, the lateral bore has to be displaced relative to the variant according to page 86 for the input shaft. Thus, the same bore may not be used for the input shaft. Consequently, the costs and storage space are disadvantageously increased. In particular, additional machining steps or adapter parts are thus required. Moreover, sufficiently thick-walled material must be provided already in the raw casting.<br>
It can also be seen, however, that the input components for the gearings illustrated on page 2 are different: page 56 shows a gearing according to page 2, the figure in the middle; page 88 shows a gearing according to page 2, the figure at the bottom. Page 24 shows the dimension a. The housings of the gearings on pages 2, 56 and 88 are the same. From that it can be seen that kl on page 88 is<br>
not equal to the difference of kl on page 56 and the dimension a on page 24. Therefore, the input components have to be differently designed. This is disadvantageous because the manufacturing costs are high, the required storage space is large and the administration is complicated.<br>
It can also be seen that, in the PIV gearings, the position of the second shaft differs in the three-stage variant and the four-stage variant in the same housing. This results in high manufacturing costs and component costs.<br>
The object on which the invention is based, therefore, is to develop and make producible a housing for a gearing series and a gearing construction kit with a reduced storage volume and at lower cost.<br>
According to the invention, the object is achieved by the features specified in Claim 1 in the case of the housing, in Claim 14 in the case of the gearing and in Claim 15 in the case of the gearing construction kit.<br>
Essential features of the invention in the case of the housing are that the housing for a multi-stage gearing of a gearing series which comprises at least two different variants of gearings,<br>
comprising at least<br>
two or more bores for optional use as a first bore which is<br>
provided for receiving an input shaft,<br>
a second bore C for receiving a shaft which<br>
on non-use of the first bore is provided as input shaft and<br>
on use of the first bore is provided as intermediate shaft,<br>
optionally  further  bores  (D,E,G)  for  receiving  further<br>
shafts,<br>
and a last bore F for receiving an output shaft,<br>
it being possible to produce different-stage variants of the gearing series by use or non-use of at least one of the further bores (D,G),<br>
the axis of the shaft received in the second bore C and the axis of the shaft received in the last bore F having an unchanged position in all variants, thus in particular also the different-stage variants.<br>
It is of advantage here that the position of the output and the bore C with associated shaft is always the same in the case of all different-stage variants. In this way, different-stage gearings may always be installed in the same application. The application, that is to say a machine or installation, thus does not have to be altered when the number of stages are to be changed. But attachments, such as mounting flanges, auxiliary drives, fans, cooling devices and sensors, may also be mounted on at the same place. Thus, corresponding fastening means or thickenings in the housing wall may also be provided.<br>
In addition, advantageously, different different-stage gearings are to be producible with a single housing. The bores are already provided for this. All that is required therefore is finishing and/or mounting on further components, such as bearing and shaft, in the respective bore to be used.<br>
An essential feature is also that, because the position of the shaft in bore C and F is always the same, many more components are reusable in different gearings than in the prior art.<br>
Since, then, the shaft in bore C is always at the same position, all input-side components are also reusable. When using an input angular stage which is connected to the housing by an adapter, this is particularly applicable and has cost benefits. The shaft to be used for this may likewise be reused even if the shaft is arranged parallel to the shaft in bore C.<br>
In an advantageous configuration, at least two of these two or more bores for optional use as a first bore are each oriented in such a way that the respectively associated input shaft axis intersects the axis of the second shaft and these two input shaft axes are orientable at right angles to one another. In particular, a third of the bores for optional use as a first bore which is provided for receiving an input shaft is provided and oriented in such a way that the axis of the input shaft axis [sic] is oriented parallel to the axis of the shaft received in the bore C.<br>
It is of advantage here that optionally two different input shafts oriented in different directions may be introduced. However, not only angular stages but also a cylindrical gear stage may be produced as input with the same housing. Consequently, different arrangements and uses of the gearing within an installation are made possible. Depending on the available constructional space, the associated input electric motor may thus be mounted on the front wall or top wall or else side wall. Consequently, it is only every necessary to manufacture one identical housing, although the variants may be differently designed, in particular different with respect to the number of gearing stages of the respective gearing and/or the relative orientation of the input and output shaft axis with respect to one another. Only one and the same housing needs to be stored in the store, even if different gearings are to be manufactured therefrom. This reduces complexity, storage space and costs.<br>
An advantage of the invention is also that the dimensioning of the input parts is the same even with a 90° offset. Thus, the corresponding parts are reusable.<br>
In an advantageous configuration, by use or non-use of at least one of the further bores, different-stage variants of the gearing series may be produced, the first and last bore being usable unchanged. In particular, the number of successive gearing stages varies in the case of the different-stage variants if the first of these stages<br>
comprises the bore C and the last the bore F. It is of advantage here that in all cases only one and the same housing is necessary "and thus the costs and storage space, as well as the complexity, are reduced.<br>
In an advantageous configuration, the input shaft is connected to at<br>
least one toothed part comprised by the first gearing stage,<br>
the output shaft being connected to at least one toothed part<br>
comprised by the last gearing stage,<br>
each further shaft being connected to at least two toothed parts<br>
comprised by respective gearing stages. It is of advantage here the<br>
helically toothed or straight-toothed cylindrical gearing stages or<br>
else other types of gearing stages may be used.<br>
In an advantageous configuration, a further bore for optional use as a first bore is provided, this bore being oriented in such a way that the associated input shaft axis is oriented parallel to the axis of the second shaft. It is of advantage here that simple and inexpensive cylindrical gearing stage [sic] may be used.<br>
In an advantageous configuration, unused bores are closable by a closing means. It is of advantage here that on non-use the bore may be sealed off in a simple manner.<br>
In an advantageous configuration, the housing has, instead of the bores, recesses for creating the respective bore. In particular, the recesses are designed as knockouts, that is to say with a thin wall thickness. It is of advantage here that the casting material and even closing means may be saved and the machining costs are nevertheless low.<br>
In an advantageous configuration, the bores are each provided at a bearing location of the housing, that is to say in particular the housing wall is of thickened design in the region around the bore. It is of advantage here that the multiple use of the housing for different gearing variants of the series is integrated already in the design of the raw casting. In particular, all potentially usable bearing locations are advantageously designed with appropriate stability, in which case only the bore still needs to be produced and machined.<br>
In an advantageous configuration, the toothed part of the input shaft is in engagement with at least one toothed part of the second shaft, so as to form a first gearing stage, a further toothed part of the second shaft being in engagement with at least one toothed part of a further shaft, so as to form a second gearing stage, and a toothed part of a further shaft being in engagement with at least one toothed part of the output shaft, so as to form a last gearing stage. It is of advantage here that gearings with two or more stages may be produced.<br>
In an advantageous configuration, at least three bores are arranged in a straight line. It is of advantage here that a housing which is<br>
as low as possible and has a volume as compact as possible may be produced.<br>
In an advantageous configuration, the optionally used or unused further bore for producing different-stage variants of the gearing series are not arranged in this line. It is of advantage here that the input and output shaft may be mounted at the same position.<br>
Essential features of the invention in the case of the gearing are that the respective gearing, that is to say the respective variant of the gearing series, may be produced from the same casting. Only the bore for fitting bearings and/or adapters needs to be used or not. Consequently, only one master mould is required during casting, which reduces costs and complexity.<br>
Essential features of the invention in the case of the gearing construction kit are that the gearing construction kit comprises different variants of multi-stage gearings, the housings of all the variants being producible from the above-described housings.<br>
It is of advantage here that, in turn, the same housing may be used for different variants and thus the logistics when manufacturing on a worldwide basis as well as the storage costs may be reduced. For, only one kind of housing ever needs to be produced, even if different gearing variants are produced therefrom at other locations.<br>
In an advantageous configuration, in particular the production of bores is provided by removing knockouts and/or machining recesses. In particular, at a bearing location an adapter comprising the associated bearing is connectable. This is simple and cost-effective .<br>
In an advantageous configuration, variants comprise a housing according to the above-described type having the advantages described there.<br>
Further advantages can be gathered from the subclaims.<br>
(Table Remove)<br>
'The invention will now be explained in more detail with reference to figures:<br>
Figure 1 shows, symbolically from the side, a housing, according to the invention, of the gearing series. The bores B, C, D, E, F are provided at regions of the housing where thickenings of the housing wall are produced, allowing a bearing location to be created. When casting the housing, material can be saved by leaving free the regions of bores in the housing wall. In this case, only finishing which is simple and can be quickly performed is possible.<br>
To produce the individual variants of the gearing series, either all the bores or only some of the bores are used for the bearing arrangement for a shaft. The unused bores are tightly closed by a closing means. Suitable closing means are covers and the like.<br>
In further exemplary embodiments according to the invention, provision is also made for a recess, such as a knockout or other thinning of the housing wall or the like. In this way, the closing means can be dispensed with. If, however, it is necessary to make the bore, material is to be 'appropriately removed.<br>
An essential advantage, then, in the case of the invention is that the same housing may be used for gearings with a different number of stages, as few bores or recesses as possible being required for the entire series. In the case of different-stage gearings with a differently oriented design in each case, that is to say different relative orientations of the input with respect to the output shaft axis, the same bores are thus used.<br>
Figure 1 shows the bores in the side wall of the housing. Bore F serves for introducing the bearing of the output shaft. The output shaft carries a toothed part, to which it is connected in materially joined, force-fitting or form-fitting manner and which is in engagement with a toothed part connected to the shaft mounted in the bearing provided in the bore E. The said toothed parts thus form the last stage of the gearing. The associated centre distance is a_4.<br>
In a corresponding manner, the next-to-last stage is realised with the bores E and D, the centre distance being a_3.<br>
The stage that may precede this stage is, in turn, realised in a corresponding manner with the bores D and C, the centre distance being a_2.<br>
There may be a still further preceding stage, which is realised analogously to the bores C and B, the centre distance being a_l. Since the housing is of sufficient size, the position of the bore B may be positioned in a pivoting region about the bore C. This is indicated in Figure 1 by broken lines. The bore B thus does not have to be in line with the bores C, E and F.<br>
As can be seen from Figure 1, a four-stage gearing may be produced. The upper and lower half of the gearing housing here may be manufactured separately, the separating line being indicated in Figure 1 and passing through the centre points of the bores B, C, E, F. To produce the gearing, the two halves are placed one on top of the other after introducing the shafts with the toothed parts. Alternatively, the housing may also be manufactured from a single raw casting, in which case the relative positioning of the two halves with respect to one another is not applicable.<br>
As shown in Figure 2, if the bore B is not used, a three-stage gearing may be produced. Bore C is used for the input shaft. The first stage of this three-stage gearing thus uses the toothed parts which are connected to the shafts mounted in the bores C and D.<br>
AS shown in Figure 3, if the bore B is not used, a two-stage gearing may be produced. In this case, it is of advantage that the centre distance of the first stage here is a_3 and thus the transmission ratios are matched. Bore C is used, in turn, for the input shaft.<br>
Advantageously, the distance of the bore centre points of the bores C and E is, in turn, chosen as a_3. For, this advantageously results in toothed parts in the case of the two-stage gearing and in the case of the three-stage gearing being reusable. Consequently, the manufacturing costs are reduced and many variants may be produced from only a small number of individual components.<br>
The shaft axis of the input shaft is oriented parallel to the further shaft axes of the shafts seated in the bores C, D, E and F.<br>
In Figures I to 3, all the stages are thus realised as cylindrical gearing stages. To reduce the operating noises here, not only straight-toothed but optionally also helically toothed cylindrical gears may advantageously be used.<br>
Figure 4 shows an angular gearing stage as the input stage. For this purpose, provision is made at a front side for a bore for receiving an attachable adapter A. A bevel pinion 2, which may be used for example, is depicted by broken lines. The shaft axis of the input shaft intersects the axis of the shaft seated in bore C.<br>
Figure 4 thus shows a four-stage version.<br>
Figure 5 shows a corresponding three-stage version, the bores [sic] D, in turn, not being used.<br>
In Figure 6, the input shaft is rotated by 90° relative to the input shaft according to Figure 4, that is to say is provided at the upper side of the gearing.<br>
In contrast, Figure 7 shows a similar version, but with three stages. Here, the particular advantage of the invention can be seen.through the convenient arrangement of the bore D, it is possible :hrough non-use of the latter to make a three-stage gearing from a :our-stage gearing without having to alter the position of the input shaft. One and the same housing may thus be used for different-stage gearings, in particular when an input angular gearing stage is present. This is different from and an improvement over the prior art in particular, since the bore for receiving the bearing arrangement of the input shaft is not designed differently in the case of the three-stage gearing and in the case of the four-stage gearing.<br>
Figure 8 shows once again the four-stage version of a cylindrical gearing. The bore C here is made at the bearing location of the first intermediate shaft. It thus carries two cylindrical gears here. In Figure 4, 5, 6, and 7, this shaft provided in bore C carries a bevel gear which is in engagement with the input bevel pinion.<br>
The bevel pinion axis in Figure 4 and 5 lies in the plane of the greatest centre distance, while in Figures 6 and 7 it is perpendicular thereto.<br>
The aforementioned advantages are particularly important in the case of very large, so-called industrial gearings. These gearings have a maximum transmittable power of more than 100 kW.<br>
As can be seen from the figures, only a single housing according to the invention is required to produce a 2-, 3-, and 4-stage cylindrical gearing and also a 3- and 4-stage bevel gearing, thus a total of at least 7 versions.<br>
A further essential advantage is also that the same attachments, for example motor adapters, can be adapted for all bevel gearings of one size. As is the case with the interfaces and the attachments for the 2- and 3-stage cylindrical gearings, which can be also be used on the 4-stage cylindrical gearing by translation along the housing by a_l.<br>
In the case of the invention, it is also essential that, for the same housing and same location of the output shaft and/or output bearing and/or output bore, the location of the axis of the second shaft of the gearing may always be provided at the same position. This applies not only to a three-stage gearing but also to multi­stage variants, such as four-stage or five-stage variants.<br>
Thus, only one housing needs to be manufactured and this housing may be used for a three-stage, four-stage, and five-stage variant. At the same time, the input may be parallel or at an angle, of in particular 90°, to the output shaft, without the location of the second axis of the second shaft having to be altered. There are so to speak two fixed sizes: the location of the second axis and of the axis of the output shaft.<br>
This discovery is surprising to a person skilled in the art. For, in the prior art this has not been accomplished.<br>
In the case of the invention, it is advantageous that the reusability of components has thereby been enormously increased.<br>
Figures 9 to 11 show other exemplary embodiments:<br>
In these, even a five-stage variant according to Figure 10 or 11 may be achieved and, if the input angular stage is omitted, a four-stage variant according to Figure 9.<br>
The bores C, E and F in all the variants are located at the same place and in a line. If the bores D and G and also the input angular stage are not used, a two-stage variant may thus be achieved.<br>
With additional use of the bore D and optional use of the input angular gearing stage, as well as the associated bore with adapter A, again the variants which have also already been made known from Figures 2 to 8 may be achieved.<br>
With additional use of the bore 6, however, even more stages and a further range of transmission ratios may be achieved, the same housing always being usable.<br>
Since the distance from C to D is equal to the distance from B to D, correspondingly associated toothed parts are reusable. This reduces manufacturing and storage costs, also because of the reducible storage space.<br>
It is important here to observe the relationship a_l 
Moreover, the dimensioning of the input parts, that is to say the values c, d, d_3, and g, is the same in Figure 11 and 10. Thus, the same parts may also be used.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
