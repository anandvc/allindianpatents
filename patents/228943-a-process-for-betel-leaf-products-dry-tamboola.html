FIELD  OF INVENTIONS<br>
This invention relates to developing a process for a Betel Leaf Product (Dry Tamboola) a health promoting masticatory having longer shelf life to replace the traditional Tamboola of perishable nature. Traditionally Tamboola is an intergral part of any of our social functions and / or ceremonies. It is also recommended as a digestive tonic after good food. It is also a mouth freshner. In traditional functions Tamboola is presented by serving the ingredients namely betel leaves, arecanuts, and calcium hydroxide. Apart from the social functions and ceremonies Tamboola is also taken by people as habit at regular intervals. Regular consumers of Tamboola have to carry with them the betel leaves, arecanuts and calcium hydroxide individually in their original form. There is great inconvenience in carrying these ingredients of Tamboola as large containers are required. There is also yet another disadvantage as longer time is taken for preparing Tamboola for regular consumption in unmixed form. That apart betel leaves may not be available at all places and times when ever required. Being highly perishable there is greater amount of wastage also. This invention therefore aims at producing a Betel Leaf Product (Dry Tamboola), as a substitute for traditional Tamboola of perishable nature using dehydrated betel leaves and processed arecanuts with calcium hydroxide which hitherto was thought to be not possible.<br>
BACKGROUND  OF THE INVENTION<br>
Presently it is not known to present the Tamboola in a ready to use form in predetermined mix of betel leaves, arecanuts and calcium hydroxide.   In the existing art only ready to consume flavoured and<br><br>
processed arecanuts without betel leaves are available. This can no way be considered as Tamboola. The drawback the industry faced hitherto is preserving the betel leaves retaining all its properties for longer periods. The breakthrough attained in the present invention in preserving the betel leaves for a longer period would enable the preparation of a Betel Leaf Product (Dry Tamboola) in premixed form and to use at any time up to a minimum of 12 months. The advantage of the present invention in preserving the betel leaves is to manufacture the Tamboola in bulk under organised hygienic conditions and market the product as any other consumer product in convenient packages hitherto unkonwn in the industry.<br>
The Primary aim and object of this invention is to make a premixed Betel Leaf Product (Dry Tamboola) with most of its original quality and taste.<br>
Another object of this invention is to make dehydrated betel leaves capable of preserving for longer periods.<br>
Yet another object of this invention is to make available the Dry Tamboola in a ready to use form by industrial manufacture and make it available by sale through consumer out lets in convenient sachets.<br>
DESCRIPTION  OF  THE  INVENTION<br>
1.    Dehydration of the betel leaves<br>
Fresh betel leaves are washed and shadedried and minutely cut into small pieces according to the requirement before dehydration.<br><br>
The dehydration of the leaves may be well achieved by cutting them into small pieces, mixing with 20 to 60% by weight of starch or sugar, the quantity being dependent on the moisture content of the leaves and about 0.1 to 0.2% by weight of edible glue followed by slowly heating the contents over a pan under a predetermined temparature between 140 to 160 degree Celsius with constant stirring. The betel syrrup mixture thus obtained under this process is dried in sun or by employing mechanical drying process.<br>
Depending upon the requirement this process can be slightly altered by crushing or squashing the shade dried betel leaves and then the crushed or squashed material either as such or with 10 to 20 % by weight of starch or sugar is heated over a pan at temperature changing from 100 to 140 degree Celcius followed by drying to get powder of dehydrated betel leaves.<br>
The dehydrated betel leaves by the above processes continue to posses the original aroma, taste and other qualities to a large extent.<br>
2.      Processing of arecanut fortified with calcium hydroxide and sugar<br>
The arecanuts are crushed and graded to required size. The graded arecanuts are soaked in V/% times water with 10 to 30 % by weight of sugar and 0.5 to 2.0 % by weight of calcium hydroxide. After soaking for 4 to 10 hours all the ingredients are cooked in a pressure cooker for 5 to 15 minutes followed by drying in sun<br><br>
or in any suitable dryer and the product is stored in airtight container.<br>
Preparation of the Betel Leaf Product (Dry Tamboola)<br>
Dehydrated betel leaf product prepared under the process (1) is mixed with arecanut prepared under the process (2) in equal proportion by weight and the aroma and taste components such as cardamom, fenugrek, ginger, pepper, hippali, (long pepper), cumin,   etc. in required quantity.<br>
The resultant mixture is ready for consumption as A BETEL LEAF PRODUCT (Dry Tamboola) which can be packed in required sachets or as retail packets.<br>
THE ADVANTAGES OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention is to produce dehydrated betel leaves for longer preservation and consumption retaining most of the original taste, aroma and other qualities of the betel leaves and to prepare Dry Tamboola, a ready to serve mixture.<br>
Other advantages of the invention are :-<br>
betel leaves can be preserved and made available at all times and all places and used at convenience.<br>
mass production under hygienic condition with industrial process would be possible.<br>
it avoids carrying betel leaves and arecanuts by regular users by making available the Dry Tamboola in convenient small pouches, sachets etc.<br><br>
it assures fair price to the betel leaves growers even in th peak season.<br>
this a Betel Leaf Product (Dry Tamboola) mixture, to a great extent can replace the habit of consuming Gutka or Pan masala among the general public which is highly injurious to health being tobacco based and on the contrary the Dry Tamboola is a health tonic suggested for digestion after food.<br>
/<br><br><br><br><br>
I        CLAIMa<br>
1.	A process for making a Betel Leaf Product, having longer shelf<br>
life by mixing (1) the dehydrated betel leaves wherein the fresh<br>
or shade dried betel leaves are minutely cut or crushed or squashed<br>
and roasted as such on a low flame to obtain dehydrated product<br>
or the cut or crushed or squashed material is mixed with 10 to<br>
60% by weight of starch or sugar and 0.1 to 0.2% by weight<br>
of edible gel and heated over a pan at temperature ranging from<br>
100 to 160 degree Celcius and subsequently dried in sun or in<br>
any mechanical drier with (2) processed arecanuts fortified with<br>
sugar and calcium hydroxide wherein the crushed and graded<br>
pieces fo arecanut are soaked in 1V2 times water for 4 to 10<br>
hours with 10 to 30 % by weight fo sugar and 0.5 to 2.0% by<br>
weight of calclium hydroxide followed by cooking all the<br>
