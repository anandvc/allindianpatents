				<td>The present invention relates to medical engineering, and more exactly to a device for<br>
recording polarized electromagnetic radiation of an inactivated strain of pathogenic<br>
microorganisms onto a crystal and a device for changing the activity of a strain of pathogenic<br>
microorganisms.<br>
The invention may be used for inactivation and subsequent elimination of pathogenic and<br>
conditionally pathogenic microorganisms from a human pr animal organism.<br>
The discovery "Phenomenon of intracellular distanced electromagnetic interactions in a<br>
system of two tissue cultures" (registered in the USSR State Register of Discoveries of 15<br>
February 1966, diploma 122, authors V.P. Kaznacheev, S.P. Shurin, L.P. Mikhailova) was<br>
placed at the base of the present invention.<br>
An earlier unknown phenomenon of distant intracellular electromagnetic interactions<br>
between two identical tissue cultures during the action of factors on one of them, the factors<br>
being of biological, chemical or physical nature, with a characteristic reaction of another culture<br>
in the form of a "mirror" cytopathic effect, which determines the cellular system as a detector of<br>
the modulation features of electromagnetic radiation, was experimentally established.<br>
Thus, a new information channel in biological systems was detected, and an approach to<br>
evaluation of quantum phenomenon in the mechanisms of functioning of a genetic cell program<br>
and processes of encoding information in specialized cellular systems was also experimentally<br>
developed.<br>
The possibility appeared for investigation of means for acting on pathological processes<br>
via correction of interference occurring in the photon channel of information transmission. It is<br>
presumed that this may be related to selection of chemical compounds, converting the initial<br>
light flux of a cell into monochromatic radiation. The possibility of using a new principle for<br>
treatment of a number of diseases appeared. New methods for diagnosis of the states and<br>
prognosis of the behavior of biological objects were developed on the basis of a study of the<br>
modulation characteristics of electromagnetic radiation of biosystems.<br>
A device for generating electromagnetic radiation for controlling and improving the state<br>
of live organisms is also known (see, for example, U.S.A. patent No. 5792184, 1998), the device<br>
comprising a source of energy and a generator of biofrequency spectrum, comprising an energy<br>
converter and one of the following elements or compounds thereof: Co, Cu, Mo, Li, Be, Mg, Al,<br>
Si, K, Ca, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Zn, Ge, Sr, Zr, Nb, Ta, Hf, Se, Tn, W, Au and Y.<br>
The device comprises a source of energy, an energy converter, an element ensuring<br>
generation of the biofrequency spectrum being imitated. This element is made in the form of a<br>
monomer or compounds consisting of one or several chemical elements. After excitation by the<br>
energy of transition of energetic levels, electromagnetic radiation is formed in the element in the<br>
form of a physical field of the biofrequency spectrum being imitated, which acts on live<br>
organisms. Where there is agreement with the poles of intensive absorption of the organism, a<br>
large part of the radiation energy carried by electromagnetic waves is absorbed, causing changes<br>
in the energy of molecules, atoms or electrons in live organisms, which then causes oscillation,<br>
increases biooxidation and improves the energetic state of cells, resulting in an increase of the<br>
permeability of cellular membranes.<br>
The generator of the biofrequency spectrum being imitated comprises a substrate of non-<br>
metals or ceramic, a radiating layer applied onto the substrate and consisting of borides, nitrides,<br>
carbides, sulfides or fluorides, mixed with a liquid binder., and an energy converter in the form of<br>
a electrical heating wire disposed in the substrate and arranged at the end faces of the substrate to<br>
convert electrical energy into thermal energy.<br>
The heat formed by the heating wire is used to excite chemical elements in the radiation<br>
layer.<br>
This device radiates signals of a bioresonant spectrum with wavelengths in the range of<br>
from 0.2 mm to 10 mm. The device has the following main characteristics. In the first place,<br>
the device provides for generation of a very wide spectrum of electromagnetic radiation, which<br>
covers the visible light band, the near and far IR band, the millimeter wave band and the<br>
centimeter wave band, i.e. completely covers the band of frequencies inherent to the natural<br>
radiation frequencies of the organism. In the second place, it is known that electromagnetic<br>
radiation differs in respect to intensity in different bands of the spectrum, wherein more than<br>
90% of the radiated energy is in the visual light band of the near, middle and far IR bands.<br>
Wherein the ultralongwave portion of the IR band, submillimeter and millimeter bands occupy a<br>
very wide band, but only a very small amount of the radiated energy is contained therein.<br>
In the process of operation, the energy converter converts the electromagnetic electrical<br>
energy into thermal energy and maintains a predetermined temperature of the components,<br>
ensuring the generation of electromagnetic oscillations in the range of from 0.2 to 10000 mm.<br>
It should be noted that even though this device ensures generation of electromagnetic<br>
radiation in the range of radiation of live organisms of from 0.2 mm to 10 mm, it is not capable,<br>
in the first place, of effectively changing the conformation of the transmembrane molecules<br>
located on the plasmatic membrane of pathogenic and conditionally pathogenic microbes, since<br>
thermal radiation of a component of the substrate is unpolarized or weakly-polarized and, in the<br>
second place, of selectively acting on cells of the organism, for example, to reduce the activity of<br>
pathogenic microbes in the organism without changing the activity of the organism"s own cells<br>
and the cells of the commensal microflora of this organism.<br>
Some of the aspects of the discovery made by Alexander Gurich are disclosed in the<br>
publication by Fritz Albert Pope - "Some Properties of Biophotons and Their Interpretation<br>
under Conditions of Coherent States" in a magazine of the International Institute of Biophysics,<br>
Germany, 1999. Gurvich called the emission of photons from live cells "mitogenetic<br>
radiation," which was not accepted by his contemporaries, but at the present time has been put at<br>
the base of many works.<br>
The energy of activation encompasses the whole electromagnetic spectrum of radiation<br>
from radio waves, microwaves, infrared radiation up to the visual and even ultraviolet radiation.<br>
And there is only one carrier for the transfer of energy to millions of reactions per second and to<br>
each cell - this is unheated photons. A coherent photon field is the source of such photons.<br>
Therefore a weak flow of photons from a biological object, which is well known at present and<br>
includes the whole spectrum of radiation from ultraviolet to infrared, is called with biophotons<br>
and may be quite sufficient to carry out the role of controlling the biochemistry and biology of a<br>
live organism.<br>
The therrnoluminescence, or more exactly - thermostimulated luminescence,<br>
phenomenon is also known (see, for example, "Thermoluminescence of Lithium Fluoride," pp.<br>
212-215 in the monograph "Radiation Physics," v. 5, "Luminescence and Defects of Ionic<br>
Crystals," published by Zinatie, Riga, 1967). This phenomenon is based on absorption by the<br>
crystal of photons of the gamma band, roentgen and ultraviolet bands and the creation in the<br>
crystal of stable energetic states or coloring centers which carry information on the band and the<br>
dose of electromagnetic action. This phenomenon is widely used in thermoluminescence<br>
dosimetry. Alkali halogen crystals, for example, lithium fluoride, are used as the sensitive<br>
element.<br>
A recording of the electromagnetic action is carried out at a constant temperature of the<br>
crystal in the range of from 70°K to 300°K.<br>
Reading the information recorded on the crystal is carried out by changing the<br>
temperature of the crystal in the range of from 110°K to 800°K, wherein the spectrum of the<br>
information signal radiated by the crystal is primarily in the visual region of the spectrum from<br>
0.3 to 0.7 mm.<br>
These crystals makes it possible to retain the recorded information only within several<br>
weeks or months, to carry out the reading of the recorded information by changing the<br>
temperature of the crystal within the range of from 110°K to 800°K with the radiation spectrum<br>
within the range of from 0.3 to 0.7 mm.<br>
 A device is known for changing the activity of a biological cell (see, for example, RF<br>
patent No. 2055604, 1993), comprising a unit for action which carries out reception and<br>
transmission of electromagnetic waves and which is positioned adjacent the biological cell. The<br>
unit for action is made in the form of a single element and carries out the storage of received<br>
electromagnetic waves. A unit for changing the temperature is connected to the unit for action.<br>
The devices makes it possible to change the activity of biological cells of one type<br>
without changing the activity of biological cells of other types as a result of the resonant<br>
interaction of electromagnetic waves of low intensity of the device and cells on its bioresonant<br>
frequency.<br>
The device operates in the following manner. At first information is recorded in a<br>
memory on the metabolic activity of deposited cells, changed in any known manner. With the<br>
aid of the unit for changing temperature, a single element is heated. Wherein information on a<br>
changed metabolic activity of deposited cells at a bioresonant frequency is recorded in the<br>
memory. Heating is carried out with subsequent forced or natural cooling. Cooling may first<br>
be carried out, and then heating, which composes a cycle of changing the temperature of a single<br>
element.<br>
Then a patient - a carrier of pathogenic microorganisms, the activity of which should be<br>
changed, is placed directly adjacent a single element and a temperature change cycle is carried<br>
out. Wherein, the generator radiates electromagnetic waves of low intensity at the bioresonant<br>
frequency of the cells. As a result of the radiation the metabolic activity of the cell being<br>
irradiated is set similar to that deposited with a changed metabolic activity. In order to maintain<br>
the predetermined metabolic activity of the cells being irradiated for a lengthy period of time,<br>
repeated sessions of irradiation are carried out at certain intervals of time.<br>
The device does not provide a high degree of inactivation of pathogenic microorganisms<br>
and does not make it possible to effectively eliminate different pathogenic and conditionally<br>
pathogenic microorganisms which are in the organism of a human being or animal.<br>
The efficiency of operation of this device rapidly falls in the process of conducting<br>
therapeutic sessions, and furthermore, the device in the process of operation constantly<br>
accumulates parasitic polarized radiation from other strains of pathogenic microorganisms which<br>
are in an active state in the live organism being irradiated-.<br>
It should be noted that as regards modern physics any electromagnetic field is the<br>
photonic, corpuscular one, where photon has energy, mass, kinetic momentum and<br>
angular momentum - spin. Any electromagnetic field may be always considered as a<br>
set of linearly-polarized waves, and the linearly-polarized wave can be considered as a<br>
set of left-and right-polarized waves.<br>
Thus, the non-polarized radiation always is a set of polarized waves, and for this<br>
reason the bioelectromagnetic fields, biophotons and mitogenetic radiation also<br>
represent the polarized electromagnetic radiation.<br>
This is well explained in Zhvirblis V.E. "Asymmetry versus Chaos, or What the Biofield<br>
Is". In an ordinary electromagnetic wave, electrical vector E that determines result of<br>
interaction of radiation with a substance, fluctuates in single plane, perpendicular to a<br>
direction of wave propagation. Such wave is termed as the plane-polarized one.<br>
In all researches of the biological action exerted by electromagnetic radiations: either<br>
non-polarized or plane-polarized radiation, or a radiation polarized in an unknown way<br>
were used. But electromagnetic radiation can be polarized not only in plane, but<br>
circumferentially as well. It means that vector E rotates either clockwise or counter-<br>
clockwise so that the wave becomes asymmetric. Addition of two such right and left-<br>
polarized waves of one frequency and one amplitude produces the plane-polarized<br>
radiation having the symmetry plane; conversely, any plane-polarized wave cannot be<br>
represented as the sum of left and right-polarized waves of one frequency and one<br>
amplitude. Such is the theory, long supported by experiments. In principle, the whole<br>
foregoing discussion can apply to any electromagnetic radiation too.<br>
The first successful attempts to discover emission of cells using the photoelectric effect<br>
were made by Rayevskiy who employed a modified Geiger-Mueller counter, see:<br>
"Fisher H., Photons as transmitter for biochemical communication. The construction of<br>
a hypothesis." Based on the results obtained by him, Rayevskiy assesses intensively of<br>
the radiation emitted by biological objects (an onion root, muscle carcinoma) within the<br>
limits about 1010...10-9 erg/cm-2/s-1, which range corresponds to 100...200 quantum s/s.<br>
F.Popp, considering the biological radiation as a possible regulator of biological<br>
functions, and analyzing results of measurements of superweak emission of photons<br>
by the live cells made by him, believes that biological systems may be considered as<br>
the coupled nonlinear oscillators; each oscillator can be considered as a new<br>
resonator, and when resonance is involved, then an high polarization and conductivity<br>
with greatly efficient transformation and utilization of energy, and also ability of a<br>
biological systems to store information for long time should be assumed.<br>
So, the foregoing shows that polarizability (i.e. that photon has angular momentum-<br>
spin) is one of the parameters that describes the physical state of any electromagnetic<br>
wave.<br>
It should be also noted that presently the possibility of emission of electromagnetic<br>
waves by a biological object (including both cells of animals and microbes), and that of<br>
increasing intensity of the electromagnetic waves emission by biological objects, after<br>
their exposure to an extreme agent, have been proved experimentally.<br>
Consequently, the above-discussed physical phenomenon underlying the technical<br>
solution of the claimed invention is well known in science.<br>
Reference "Kaznacheyev V.P., Mikhaylova L.P. Bionformational function of natural<br>
electromagnetic fields" notes that by use of mercury-dichloride sublimate in dose of 8-<br>
10 mct/ml as an extreme agent to affect the tested cells, which agent causes the cell to<br>
perish in first several hours of exposure, intensity of the radiation exceeds the<br>
background level and sharply increases immediately after said sublimate is<br>
administered, and then decreases back to the background level after 3-5 hours; and by<br>
use of said sublimate in dose of 4-5 mct/ml causing the cellular monolayer to perish<br>
after 2-3 days due to blockage of respiratory enzymes - the radiation intensity growth<br>
maintained for 8-12 hours was determined.<br>
The author emphasizes that "prospects for assessing biosystems and controlling them<br>
without application of chemical, preventive and medicinal preparations is to be the<br>
future remote-control biophysical therapy. Its premises do exist, and they are becoming<br>
indispensable for life in view of the ever increasing medicinal, chemical and<br>
environmental intoxication."<br>
So, the foregoing shows that polarizability (i.e. that photon has angular momentum-spin<br>
is one of the parameters that describes the physical state of any electromagnetic wave.<br>
It should be also noted that presently the possibility of emission of electromagnetic<br>
waves by a biological object (including both cells of animals and microbes), and that of<br>
increasing intensity of the electromagnetic waves emission by biological objects, after<br>
their exposure to an extreme agent, have been proved experimentally.<br>
Consequently, the above-discussed physical phenomenon underlying the technical<br>
solution of the claimed invention is well known in science.<br>
Capability of a substance-carrier of information (in this case - a crystal) to emit similar<br>
polarized electromagnetic waves is discussed as follows. Some proofs to confirm said<br>
capability are given below.<br>
Example 1. Known is a method for reproducing non-synthetic diagnostic preparations<br>
(see: Patent RU No. 2014080, 1992).<br>
The essence of the invention consists in that reproduction (recording and reproduction<br>
of electromagnetic radiation) of non-synthetic diagnostic means (nosodes, member-<br>
extracted preparations) is effected on liquid crystals have the phase transition<br>
temperature over 60°C, which crystals, prior to reproduction, are heated hotter than the<br>
transition point, with subsequent decrease of temperature back to the initial value<br>
thereof during reproduction.<br>
The method is implemented as follows:<br>
On one of two conductive sites (the entry site) of a known device, positioned is a<br>
preparation whose properties are to be transferred onto a carrier placed on a second<br>
site(the exit site). As the latter, used is a liquid-crystal film, a layer of liquid crystal on a<br>
substance or a solution thereof; the liquid crystal having the phase transition<br>
temperature over 60°C (the most preferred value is 70°C-100°C). Before the carrier is<br>
placed on the second site, its temperature is increased by 10-20oC higher than the<br>
relative point of phase transition, and then on the carrier is quickly placed on the exit<br>
site of a re-write device, where the carrier remains until its own temperature falls below<br>
the transition point.<br>
Fidelity of reproduction of spectrum of electromagnetic radiation by liquid crystals was<br>
confirmed by diagnoses of 128 patients using R Fall method by comparison of the<br>
effect of ampouled nosodes and liquid crystals whereon electromagnetic radiation of<br>
said nosodes had been recorded.<br>
Example 2. Reference "Korenbaum V.I. et al, Matters relating to physical mechanisms<br>
of change of a patient"s strength in muscle testing with use of homeopathic nosodes",<br>
describes one of diagnostic techniques of applied kinesiology, said technique<br>
consisting of the contactless action to be extended on a patient by homeopathic<br>
nosodes, and of registration of the human organism responses thereto, which response<br>
appears in the form of the muscle weakness phenomenon.<br>
Authors mention that "Presently there is no doubt as to the existence of the biological<br>
field in living organisms [Kozhevnikov Yu. P. Matters relating to the concept of<br>
photogenic field]. Its electromagnetic component is registered by up-to-date devices.<br>
Thus, existence of specific, sufficiently broadband, electromagnetic perturbations near<br>
body of a human is the actual reality.<br>
On the other hand, the homeopathic nosode substances, being the product of dilution<br>
of microdoses of substances in distilled water, have the long-employed and clinically<br>
confirmed [Linde K et al, Are the clinical effects of homeopathy placebo effects? A<br>
meta-analysis of placebo-controlled trials] effect of "memory" of the initial preparations.<br>
The surmise is that said property is carried by the newly-discovered stable crystalline<br>
nanosized formations (rod-like clusters) [Shui-Yin Lo. Anomalous state of ice].<br>
These structures are hardly able to emit themselves. It seems more probable [Shaub<br>
U.B. Actual medical research using novel physical techniques] that they would create a<br>
selective oscillating system having its own resonant frequency being unique to an initial<br>
substance. When in the biological field there are proximate-frequency perturbations,<br>
then excitation of the forced electromagnetic oscillations of these structures occurs,<br>
which oscillations are emitted into environment. Of course, intensity of such radiation is<br>
small, but if beside (in the proximate field) there are resonant oscillating systems turned<br>
to the same frequency, then the secondary excitation of the forced oscillations may<br>
occur (the effect of "two tune-forks").<br>
Basing on the claimed invention [IN application], in Russia at Izhevsk Mechanical<br>
Engineering Works, since 1999, the "Biofon"-series of antimicrobial devices [official<br>
Web-site of "Biofon"- series devices"] have been serially produced, which device aids<br>
the human organism in freeing from microorganisms, among which are: clamydia,<br>
ureaplasm, mycoplasm, viruses of herpes, influenza, staphylococci, streptococci,<br>
tubercle bacillus, candidiasis fungi, Trichomonas fungi, amoebas, lamblia and other<br>
microorganisms.<br>
This device is successfully employed for treatment of diseases of kidneys, urinary<br>
bladder, genitalia, infertility, venereal and parasitic infections, pneumonia, angina,<br>
bronchitis, maxillary sinusitis, otitis, tick-bome encephalitis, as well as for normalization<br>
of microflora and for making a human organism healthier in general.<br>
Below are given some examples on the basis of which applicability and patentability of<br>
the claimed invention can be affirmed, and which support its efficiency and the physical<br>
phenomenon underlying the features of the invention.<br>
Example 3. Reference "Mordovskoy G.G., Investigation of the action of "Biofon"<br>
medical device exerted on mycrobacteria and assessment of efficiency thereof.<br>
Sverdlovsk regional scientific-practical association "Phthisiopulmonology" describes<br>
investigations of the action provided by electromagnetic radiation in the IR range of<br>
"Biofon" antimicrobial device, wherein as the means for recording and reproducing the<br>
spectrum of changes of biological cells used were microcircuit transistors based on<br>
silicon crystal whereon electromagnetic radiation of inactivated strains of pathogenic<br>
mycobacteria (M. tuberculosis) was recorded.<br>
Results of said investigation are represented in Table No. 1.<br>
The study revealed: suppression of growth of the deposited virulent strains of<br>
tuberculosis bacterially H37Rv, Bovines and Avium, and strains, extracted from<br>
tuberculosis patients Nos.1, 2, 3; and activation of growth of avirulent strains H37Rv and<br>
Smegmatis saprophytic strain.<br>
As regards treatment of tuberculosis patients, [ibid] notes that after one month of<br>
treatment, abacillation (destruction of tuberc le bacillus) using "Biofon" device was<br>
achieved for 74.2% of the patients, and only for 33.3% of the control group patients.<br>
Thus, based on the foregoing, it can be asserted that there are indisputable facts<br>
concerning capability of "a means for recording and reproducing " to emit the polarized<br>
electromagnetic waves of an inactivated strain, to inactivate similar strains and<br>
facilitate freeing of human organism from them. An high medical-biological efficiency of<br>
the devices based on the claimed invention should be mentioned.<br>
Example 4. Reference "Assessment of the anti-virus effect of "ORVI-Biofon" devices<br>
in case of the experimental influenza infection introduced into white mongrel mice.<br>
RAMS Research Institute for influenza" cites investigations for assessing the action<br>
produced by "ORVU-Biofon" devices on influenza viruses.<br>
In said "ORVI-Biofon" device, radiation emitted by inactivated strains of influenza<br>
viruses was recorded beforehand.<br>
In the course of said investigation, two series of experiments were carried out.<br>
First, the anti-influenza action of "ORVI-Biofon" device was assessed basing on the<br>
data of lethality of white mice due to the experimental influenza infection introduced via<br>
strains of viruses of A/Puerto Rico/8/3/34(HINI) influenza, which are virulent for said<br>
animals. Second, action of the same device was investigated in respect of reproduction<br>
of influenza viruses in lungs of white mice, and the anti-influenza action of said device<br>
was assessed.<br>
After they had been infected by the influenza virus, the animals every 3-4 hours were<br>
subjected to irradiation emitted from "ORVI-Biofon" devices for 10 days. On the 10th day<br>
after the infection, among 30 control animals only 9 mice remained alive (survivability<br>
being 33.3%), and in the experimental group 28 mice remained alive (survivability being<br>
93.3%).<br>
Comparative assessment of the influenza virus" capability of reproduction in lungs of<br>
the white mice affected by the experimental influenza infection under the normal<br>
conditions and in case of regular application of "ORVI-Biofon" device showed a<br>
decrease in concentration of influenza virus in lungs of the irradiated mice, as<br>
compared with the control group, 3...6 times on the third day; and 2.....5 times on the<br>
seventh day.<br>
Authors of said reference conclude that application of "ORVI-Biofon" device allows<br>
reduce lethality of white mice at least 10 times and decrease concentration of the virus<br>
in lungs of white mice 2...5 times, preventing subsequent complications and lethality.<br>
Thus, the possibility to record the polarized electromagnetic radiation emitted from<br>
inactivated strains" viruses (at least those of influenza) of biological cells onto a means<br>
for recording and reproducing, and the possibility to radiate the polarized<br>
electromagnetic waves by said means, and also the possibility to suppress activity of<br>
an experimental virus, similar to the recorded one, can be considered as proved.<br>
Examples 1, 2, 3, 4 cite actual instances of capability of means for recording and<br>
reproducing (substances-carriers of information) to record the polarized<br>
electromagnetic waves of inactivated microorganisms and to emit similar polarized<br>
electromagnetic waves in the course of a change of physical state of a means for<br>
recording and reproducing.<br>
In terms of physics, the capability of means for recording and reproducing to record<br>
and reproduce the polarized electromagnetic waves is described in sufficient detail in;<br>
Zhvirblis V.E. Asymmetry versus Chaos, or What the Biofield Is.<br>
This physical phenomenon in said reference is substantiated as follows, verbatim:<br>
"The right- and left-polarized electromagnetic waves interact with the right- and left-<br>
structure substances differently. For example, when asymmetric is a crystal lattice (as<br>
that of quartz crystal), or asymmetric is a structure of molecules (similarly to molecules<br>
of natural aminoacids).<br>
But interaction of a asymmetric electromagnetic field with an asymmetric substance is<br>
of the mutual nature. This results not only in purely optical effects, but also in those of<br>
quite a material property, for example the interaction allows obtain these or other<br>
organic compound mirror isomers in abundance.<br>
Reference is made to Fig 10; Fig. 10 shows an alteration of symmetry of the mirror<br>
isomers of organic molecules under the action of any asymmetric (right- or left-<br>
polarized) field. Regular tetrahedrons ABCD, having various substitutes on their apexes<br>
bonded with carbon atom in centre O, transform into tetrahedrons A"B"C"D" and<br>
A"B"C"D", which tetrahedrons are not the exact mirror twins anymore; further the<br>
relative arrangement of all atoms changes (r" is not equal to r")- This effect cannot<br>
depend on spatial orientation of a molecule, and is to be defined only by sign and<br>
amount of chiral energy dE* absorbed by a molecule; this effect may be4 characterized<br>
by a value of de=±dE*/E, where E is energy of the molecule bonds in the non-deformed<br>
state. As the thermal motion is spherically symmetrical, then- at any temperature, chiral<br>
influence being absent - de=0.<br>
In other words, under the action of the electromagnetic radiation, polarized circularly,<br>
properties of the asymmetrical molecules inevitably change; and , in general case,<br>
properties of the mirror isomers are capable of being changed under the action of any<br>
asymmetrical fields, inclusive of the static ones.<br>
But what is the use of such effect as it is far too small? And the use is that any, even<br>
the most negligible, asymmetric influence on a substance cannot be smoothed by the<br>
spherically symmetric thermal motion: their symmetry is principally different. No matter<br>
how an asymmetric molecule, disposed in asymmetric field, would be handled, its<br>
properties in a comparison with properties existing in the unperturbed state, will not be<br>
the same, and said field cannot be influenced by thermal noise-these molecules<br>
respond to asymmetric influence in the manner as if they were at the absolute zero<br>
temperature.<br>
This is the circumstance that may have the decisive influence on the result of action<br>
exerted by weak fields on biological objects.<br>
Thus the last-mentioned reference rather exhaustively explains the physical principles<br>
of recording of the polarized electromagnetic radiation on crystals.<br>
In light of the matters discussed above, it can be asserted both in terms of practice and<br>
physics that the physical phenomenon consisting in capability of a means for recording<br>
and reproducing to emit the polarized electromagnetic waves recorded thereon, which<br>
waves are similar to the polarized electromagnetic waves of an inactivated strain, is<br>
well known in science and is widely employed in practical medicine.<br>
Regarding how the polarized electromagnetic radiation emitted by an inactivated strain<br>
is recorded , first follows a more detailed review as to generation of the polarized<br>
electromagnetic radiation of an inactivated strain of a pathogenic microorganism.<br>
The cell shell of most pathogenic and conditionally pathogenic microorganisms<br>
represents a plasma membrane having protein molecules embedded therein as shown<br>
in Fig. 10: See Alberts et al,Molecular Biology of Cell.<br>
Reference is made to Fig. 9. Schematic 3-D imaging of a small section of a cell<br>
membrane.<br>
The plasmatic membrane serves as an highly selective filter, and is responsible for<br>
inputting the nutritive substances into a cell and for outputting the discharge therefrom.<br>
Owing to the presence of a membrane, a difference of ion concentrations within a cell<br>
and in the extra-cellular space is maintained.<br>
All biological membranes, inclusive of the plasma one, represent ensembles of the lipid<br>
and protein molecules. The lipid molecules [ibid] arrange a continuous double layer<br>
having thickness 5 about 5nm.<br>
Reference "Alberts et al, Molecular Biology of Cell" notes that every plasmal membrane<br>
has an electrical field gradient. And the inner side of a membrane has the negative<br>
charge with respect to the outer side.<br>
The mean difference of electric potentials between the inner and outer shells of a lipid<br>
membrane being U5 = 50 ...100 mV [ibid], strength of its electrical field is determined<br>
by the following expression:<br>
Hence, the membrane proteins abide in a very strong electric field, and their structure<br>
in said field is subjected to transformation.<br>
According to Werth, Ch., R. Tomson, Solid Body Physics", the molecules in he static<br>
electrical field are the polarized ones, a value of complete polarization P being defined<br>
by the following expression:<br>
The membrane proteins (Fig. 10) in the external electric field E5 are polarized and will<br>
emit the polarized electromagnetic waves.<br>
According to "Basharienov A. et a/, Measurement of radiothermal and plasma radiations<br>
in UHF range", the radiation polarization may have the regular or chaotic nature. The<br>
regular polarization of radiation has the linear, elliptic or circular nature.<br>
Radiation from the membrane proteins in the external electric field E5 will be<br>
predominantly the left-polarized, or right-polarized, depending on a direction the electric<br>
field E5 has on the pathogenic strain"s plasma membrane.<br>
Addition of two such left- and right-polarized waves of one frequency and one amplitude<br>
produces the plane-polarized radiation (e.g. E5 = 0).<br>
Addition of plurality of the plane-polarized waves, having no predominant orientation in<br>
any direction, produces, in sum, the non-polarized radiation (e.g. when E5 = 0).<br>
Therewith, the presence of electrostatic field E5 on the plasma membrane of a<br>
pathogenic strain causes the right- or left-polarized electromagnetic radiation to<br>
emerge.<br>
For the purpose of establishing the blocking field d Inact on the plasma membrane of a<br>
pathogenic microorganism"s deposited strain, and of rendering a pathogenic<br>
microorganism from its active state into the inactive one, the membrane function of<br>
receiving the external signals and of quickly responding to environmental changes can<br>
be employed: See Alberts et al, Molecular Biology of Cell.<br>
The invention at issue provides for rendering a pathogenic microorganizm"s deposited<br>
strain from its active state into the inactive one with the use of an extreme agent<br>
selected from the group consisting of toxic substances, e.g. antibiotics of the<br>
bacteriostatic action or viruses, UF-radiation having wavelength of 0.1 - 0.3 mcm for a<br>
period of 10-300s.<br>
According to "Kaznacheyev V.P., Mikhaylova L.P. Bionformational function of natural<br>
electromagnetic fields": for rendering a pathogenic microorganism"s deposited strain<br>
from its active state into the inactive one, the following substances were used: mercury<br>
dichloride having concentration of 5 mg/1, UF-radiation (exposure for 40-45 s, lamp<br>
SYB-30, distance -0.5 m), virus of classic bird plague and adenovirus of type 5 in titre<br>
of 103....10"4 s; and the action exerted by the group of cells exposed to an extreme<br>
agent (A-cells), using the electromagnetic waves emitted by said cells, upon a similar<br>
group of the cells that were not affected by the extreme agents (B-cells) was<br>
investigated.<br>
In the course of the work, 12 thousands trials were done which gave the following<br>
findings:<br>
1. Intensity of electromagnetic radiation sharply rises when A-cells are subjected to<br>
the action exerted by an extreme agent.<br>
2. Under the most favourable conditions of the electromagnetic action exerted by<br>
A-cells upon B-cells, the latter perished in 70-80% of all cases.<br>
3. Duration of exertion of A-cells" electromagnetic radiation upon B-cells was 4-72<br>
hours.<br>
4. Intensity of A-cell" electromagnetic radiation was 10...1000 quantums/sq.cm.<br>
5. Interaction of the A- and B-cells is effected by electromagnetic waves in the UF,<br>
visible and IR-ranges.<br>
Reference "Wiener N., Cybernetics" notes that IR-radiation by A-cells in the molecular<br>
spectra frequencies influences the self-assembling process of complex molecules on<br>
genetic arrays.<br>
According to "Biscar G.P., Kollia S. Resolved pseudoraman band of PGA", its authors<br>
believe that the electromagnetic transfer of information may take place owing to the<br>
electronic-molecular resonance.<br>
Reference "Bauer E.S., Theoretical Biology" describes a possibility of the polarized ray<br>
emission, and mentions significance of the polarized light for some biological<br>
processes.<br>
Apart from the aforementioned techniques, there are other known methods of both<br>
inactivation of pathogenic microorganisms and recoding of their electromagnetic<br>
radiation onto various information carriers, for example-nosodes (nosodes are the<br>
preparations made according to certain homeopathic techniques of the pathologically<br>
altered members (or parts of members) of human and animals, as well as the sacrificed<br>
cultures of microorganisms, products of decomposition of members and fluids<br>
containing causative agents of diseases, or products thereof).<br>
For example, "Heel" company produces Grippe-Nosode-lnjeel preparation for treatment<br>
and prevention of influenza [Official Web-site of Heel company]; wherein as the basic<br>
substance used are thermally inactivated strains of influenza viruses:<br>
Type-A (H1N1), corresponding to Singapore/6/86;<br>
Type-A(h3N3) corresponding to Beijing/32/92;<br>
Type-B Panama/45/90.<br>
"Heel" company also produces the preparations made on the basis of inactivated<br>
bacteria (Bases of informational antimicrobial therapy (part 1), e.g:<br>
Staphylococcus-lnjeel - for furunculosis cases<br>
Pertussis-Nosode-lnjeel - for whooping cough cases<br>
A possibility to record information from a tested object onto an information carrier<br>
presently is universally doubtless and is widely used in homeopathy. Industry produces<br>
a broad variety of reprinters [Official Web-site "Scientific-practical laboratory<br>
"Resonance". Active reprinter having an operator protection unit] intended for energo-<br>
informational transfer (re-recording) of the medicinal properties of various preparations<br>
(homeopathic preparations, nosodes, toxins, etc.) from ampules and homeopathic grist<br>
onto various carriers (water, alcohol, homeopathic grist, etc.).<br>

A device for recording polarized electromagnetic radiation of an inactivated strain of<br>
pathogenic microorganisms comprises a working cell 1 (Fig. 1), disposed in a vessel 2 with a<br>

and serves to generate a wide spectrum of electromagnetic oscillations.<br>
The control unit 5 works in accordance with a predetermined algorithm which determines<br>
the sequence of connecting the cells. An example of the algorithm is provided below.<br>
The device also contains at least one standard cell 18 disposed in the vessel 2. The<br>
purpose of this cell is to restore the level of polarized electromagnetic radiation of the strain of<br>
inactivated pathogenic microorganisms in the working cell 1 and in the auxiliary cells 8, 8". In<br>
the embodiment being described the device contains three standard cells 18, 18" and 18" and<br>
means 19, 19", 19", 20, 20", 20".<br>
The standard cell 18 has at least one means 19 for recording and reproducing a spectrum<br>
of radiation of biological cells, to which a means 20 for changing temperature is connected.<br>
An input 21 of the means 20 is connected to an output 22 of the control unit 5. Wherein<br>

working cell 1 and the strain 16 of inactivated pathogenic microorganisms, and also to the means<br>
19", 19" of the standard cells 18", 18".<br>
In the embodiment being described an output 25 of the means 19" for recording and<br>
reproducing a spectrum of radiation of biological cells of the standard cell 18" is connected to an<br>
input 26 of the means 19 for recording and reproducing a spectrum of radiation of biological<br>
cells of the standard cell 18, to the input 14 of the means 3 for recording and reproducing a<br>
spectrum of radiation of biological cells of the working cell 1.<br>
An output 27 of the means 19" is connected to an input 26" of the means 19". Inputs 21"<br>
and 21" of the means are connected to outputs 22" and 22" of the control unit 5.<br>
In the aforesaid device a chip 28, containing at least two crystalline semiconductors<br>
having different types of conductance and at least one semiconductor junction, is used as the<br>
means 3 or 9 or 19 (Fig. 2) for recording and reproducing a spectrum of radiation of biological<br>
cells. In the embodiment being described, the chip 28 contains three crystalline semiconductors<br>
29, 30, 31, wherein the crystalline semiconductor 29 serves as a collector, the crystalline<br>
semiconductor 30 as a base and the crystalline semiconductor 31 as an emitter. Wherein the<br>
base semiconductor 30 with respect to the collector semiconductor 29 and to the emitter<br>
semiconductor 31 has different types of conductance.<br>
In the aforesaid device, collector junction 32 and emitter junction 33, which are<br>
positioned respectively between the collector and base semiconductors 29, 30 and between the<br>
base and emitter semiconductors 30, 31, are used as the means 4 or 10 or 20 for changing<br>
temperature. These semiconductors are connected to a source 34 via a switch 35. The<br>
temperature T to which the crystalline semiconductors 29, 30, 31 are heated is determined by the<br>
power P which is dissipated on the semiconductor junctions 32, 33 when current flows, and is<br>
determined by the equation<br><br>
where: Ii is the emitter current, I2 is the base current, U is the voltage between the collector and<br>
emitter, (3 is a transfer constant of the base current.<br>
Using a current setting element 36 connected to the base semiconductor 30, it is possible<br>
to adjust the value of the current I2 flowing through the base semiconductor 30, and consequently<br>
the temperature T to which the chip 28 is heated.<br>
Execution of the means 3 on the base of a transistor chip is more preferable than the<br>
execution of that means on the base of a diode chip, since the former makes it possible to use the<br>
source 34 with a wider range of change of the supply voltage and to use its energy with<br>
maximum efficiency.<br>
Crystals of silicon, germanium, diamond and gallium arsenide may be used as the<br>
crystalline semiconductor.<br>

inactivated pathogenic microorganisms on the means for recording and reproducing a spectrum<br>
of radiation of biological cells, action is effected on the strain of pathogenic microorganisms<br>

the range of from 10 Hz to 1014 Hz in order to increase the intensity of radiation of the strain 16<br>
of inactivated pathogenic microorganisms.<br>

41. Wherein an output 58 of the means 54 of the standard cell 53 is connected to the input 50 of<br>
the means 39 of the working cell 37, to the input 52 of the means 45 of the auxiliary cell 44 and<br>
to an input 59 of the means 45" of the auxiliary cell 44".<br>
In the variant being described, the device contains three standard cells 53, 53", 53",<br>
containing means 54, 54", 54" for recording and reproducing a spectrum of radiation of biological<br>
cells, to which the means 55, 55", 55" for changing temperature are respectively connected.<br>
Wherein, inputs 56", 56" of the means 55", 55" are connected to outputs 57", 57" of the control<br>
unit 41. An output 60 of the means 54" is connected to an input 61 of the means 54, and also to<br>
the input 50 of the means 39, to the input 52 of the means 45, and to the input 59 of the means<br>
45". An output 62 of the means 54" is connected to an input 63 of the means 54", to the input 61<br>
of the means 54, and also to the input 50 of the means 39, to the input 52 of the means 45, to the<br>
input 59 of the means 45".<br>
The device also contains a unit 64 for deleting polarized electromagnetic radiation, an<br>
input 65 of which is connected to an output 66 of the control unit 41, while an output 67 is<br>
connected to an input 68 of the means 39 of the working cell 37, an output 69 - to an input 70 of<br>
the means 45 of the auxiliary cell 44, an output 71 to an input 71" of the means 45" of the<br>
auxiliary cell 44".<br>
In this device the means 39, 45, 45", 54, 54", 54" are made similar to means 3, 9, 19.<br>
In the aforesaid device a chip 28, containing at least two crystalline semiconductors<br>
having different types of conductance and at least one semiconductor junction, is used as the<br>
means 39 (Fig. 5) or 45 or 54 for recording and reproducing a spectrum of radiation of biological<br>
cells. In the embodiment being described, the chip 28 contains three crystalline semiconductors<br>
29, 30, 31, wherein the crystalline semiconductor 29 serves as a collector, the crystalline<br>
semiconductor 30 as a base and the crystalline semiconductor 31 as an emitter. Wherein the<br>
base semiconductor 30 with respect to the collector semiconductor 29 and to the emitter<br>
semiconductor 31 has different types of conductance.<br>
In the aforesaid device, collector junction 32 and emitter junction 33, which are<br>
respectively between the collector and base semiconductors 29, 30 and between the base and<br>
emitter semiconductors 30, 31, are used as the means 40 or 46 or 55 for changing temperature.<br>
These semiconductors are connected to a source 34 via a switch 35. The temperature T to which<br>
the crystalline semiconductors 29, 30, 31 are heated is determined by the power P which is<br>
dissipated on the semiconductor junctions 32, 33 when current flows, and is determined by the<br>
equation<br>
Using a current setting element 36 connected to the base semiconductor 30, it is possible<br>
to adjust the value of the current flowing through the base semiconductor 30, and consequently<br>
the temperature T to which the chip 28 is heated.<br>
Crystals of silicon, germanium, diamond and gallium arsenide may be used as the<br>
crystalline semiconductor.<br>
Diagrams are shown in Fig. 6 which are diagrams of a change of the value of the cutoff<br>
voltage E on the plasmatic membrane in relation to the number n of test tubes 72 with the strains<br>
73 of pathogenic microorganisms therein which are sequentially inactivated with the device.<br>
In Fig. 6 are shown the moments 6.1, 6.2 and 6.3 of switching on the auxiliary cell 44,<br>
which makes it possible to increase the value of the cutoff voltage E and to inactivate a number<br>
of test tubes with strains 73 which is ten times greater than when only one working cell is used.<br>
In order to ensure effective inactivation of the strain 73 of pathogenic microorganisms<br>
and to exclude the recording of information from that strain onto the means 39, 45 and 44" of the<br>
working cell 37 and the auxiliary cells 44 and 44" in the process of the cycle of changing their<br>
temperature, it is necessary that the cutoff potential E16 on the plasmatic membrane of the<br>
inactivated strain 16 of pathogenic microorganisms by module exceeds the potential E73 on the<br>
plasmatic membrane of the strain 73 of pathogenic microorganisms which is being inactivated.<br><br>
In order to ensure the successive effective inactivation of a large number n of test tubes 72 with<br>
strains 73 of pathogenic microorganisms therein, it is necessary that the cutoff potential E16 on<br>
the plasmatic membrane of the strain 16 of pathogenic microorganisms by module would<br>
substantially exceed the potential E73 on the plasmatic membrane of the strain 16 of pathogenic<br>
microorganisms which is being inactivated<br><br>
Fig. 7 shows time diagrams of the operation of the device for one working cell, one<br>
auxiliary cell and two standard cells.<br>
Figs. 7a and 7b show respectively a sequence of control pulses applied to the input of the<br>
working cell 37 and to the input of the auxiliary cell 44.<br>
Fig. 7c shows a deletion pulse formed by the generator 64 of deletion and applied to the<br>
inputs of the working cell 37 and the auxiliary cells 44, 44".<br>
Figs. 7d and 7e show pulses applied to the inputs of the first and second standard cells<br>
respectively.<br>
Fig. 7f shows a diagram of a change of the level of polarized electromagnetic radiation of<br>
the working cell 37.<br>
Fig. 7g shows a diagram of a change of the level of polarized electromagnetic radiation<br>
of the auxiliary cell 44.<br>
Fig. 7h shows a diagram of a change of the level of polarized electromagnetic radiation<br>
of the standard cell 53.<br>
Fig. 7i shows a diagram of a change of the parasitic polarized radiation of the working<br>
cell 37.<br>
, Fig. 7j shows a diagram of a change of the parasitic polarized radiation of the auxiliary<br>
cell 44.<br>
It is evident from the presented diagrams that connection of the working cell 37 takes<br>
place during each session of inactivation of a strain of pathogenic microorganisms, connection of<br>
the auxiliary cell 44 - at each fifth session of inactivation, connection of the generator 64 for<br>
deletion - at each 20th session, connection of the standard cell 53 at each 21st session,<br>
connection of the second standard cell 53" - at each 101st session.<br>
Such an algorithm of operation makes it possible to ensure a high level of inactivation of<br>
a strain of pathogenic microorganisms with a large number of sessions of inactivation.<br>
Now consideration will be given to the operation of the device with a concrete example<br>
of a change of the activity of bacterial cells Staphylococcus aureus in a human organism.<br>
At first a culture of deposited Staphylococcus aureus cells is taken and by any known<br>
method they are put into a lowly active state, which is characterized by a high positive potential<br>
on their plasmatic membrane, for example, by subjecting them to ultraviolet radiation which has<br>
bacteriostatic action.<br>
Then the spectrum of radiation of inactivated Staphylococcus aureus cells is received and<br>
recorded.<br>
When there is a change of the temperature of the crystalline semiconductors of the means<br>
for recording and reproducing of the working, auxiliary and standard cells in the process of their<br>
intensive absorption of polarized photons radiated by conformed membrane and transmembrane<br>
molecules of the plasmatic membrane of inactivated Staphylococcus aureus cells, stable<br>
energetic states are created in the crystalline semiconductors, which are capable of radiating<br>
similar photons during repeated cycles of a change of temperature.<br>
Then the device is positioned directly adjacent to a patient 74, in the organism of which<br>
here are identical Staphylococcus aureus biological cells which are in an active state.<br>
The algorithm of operation of the device may be any and, for example, correspond to the<br>
algorithm shown in Fig. 7, wherein the period T (Fig. 8) between sessions of action is set on the<br>
basis of the time of restoration i3 of the activity of pathogenic microbes in a patient"s organism.<br><br>
Maintaining the Staphylococcus aureus cells in an inactivated state for a lengthy period<br>
of time t4 makes it possible to completely free the patient"s organism from this pathogenic<br>
Staphylococcus aureus microorganism by eliminating them with the immune system of a human<br>
and pushing them out with other microorganisms included in the makeup of the patient"s<br>
microflora.<br>
For example, to completely free the patient"s organism from Staphylococcus aureus<br>
during an acute inflammatory process, it is necessary to carry out 6 - 24 sessions a day for 10 -<br>
14 days, in the case of a chronic process it is necessary to carry out 3-6 sessions a day for 8-30<br>
days.<br>
It is possible to successively or simultaneously record several strains of pathogenic<br>
microorganisms into the device for recording polarized electromagnetic radiation. For example,<br>
all the known pathogenic strains of the Staphylococcus genus may be recorded in the device for<br>
recording polarized electromagnetic radiation. Then use of the device for changing the activity<br>
of a strain of pathogenic microorganisms, in which polarized electromagnetic radiation of all<br>
known inactivated strains of the Staphylococcus genus are recorded, makes it possible to<br>
inactivate and then eliminate any pathogenic strain of the Staphylococcus genus, which is in the<br>
organism of a human or animal.<br>
The proposed device may implement the inactivation in the organism of a human or<br>
animal of not only bacteria, but also viruses, fungi, mycoplasma, prions, single-celled simples<br>
and their toxins, wherein the device and method for their inactivation and elimination are similar<br>
to that described above.<br>
