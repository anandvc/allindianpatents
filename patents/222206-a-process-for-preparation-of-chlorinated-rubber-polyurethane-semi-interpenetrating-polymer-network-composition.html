				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This   invention   relates  to  a  process   for   the<br>
preparation     of    chlorinated    rubber-polyurethane     semi interpenetrating polymer network composition.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
A  large variety of materials are used to  absorb  the<br>
mechanical  vibrations  originating  from  the  machines.   These materials  are placed between the machine and the  floor.   These<br>
materials basically comprise of plastic, rubber and paste in  the form   of  film,  sheet,  block,  encapsulating  materials   etc.<br>
depending upon their use.  An improved type of compositions,  for absorption  of mechanical vibrations, are special  rubber  blends<br>
prepared through interpenetrating polymer network technique.   An interpenetrating polymer network (IPN) composition is a new class<br>
of  polymer  blend  wherein one polymer  is  synthesised  in  the immediate   presence  of  other  polymer.   However,  these   IPN<br>
compositions  used to absorb the mechanical vibrations, known  in the art, generally suffer from the following disadvantages.<br>
A primary disadvantage is such known IPN  compositions are useful for absorption of mechanical vibrations for a  limited<br>
range  of temperature only.  Another disadvantage is  that  these compositions  are useful only over a narrow range of  frequencies<br>
of  mechanical  vibration.  A further disadvantage is  that  such compositions suffer from high oil swellability thereby  adversely<br>
affecting  their  efficiency  over a period  of  time.   A still further  disadvantage is that these compositions are  capable  of<br>
absorbing only limited amount of mechanical energy.<br><br>

Another object of the present invention is to provide a process for preparing chlorinated rubber- polyurethane semi-interpenetrating polymer network composition which absorbs mechanical energy over wide temperature range from 25 to 85 ° C.<br>
Still further object of the present invention is to provide a process for preparing chlorinated rubber- polyurethane semi-interpenetrating polymer network composition which has a high damping factor for mechanical vibrations.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a process for preparing chlorinated rubber- polyurethane semi-interpenetrating polymer network composition which works over a wide range of frequencies from 1 Hz to 10 KHz.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to provide a process for preparing chlorinated rubber- polyurethane semi-interpenetrating polymer network composition which has least oil swellability thereby maintaining the stability of the composition over a period of time.<br>
Yet further object of the present invention is to provide a process for preparing chlorinated rubber- polyurethane semi-interpenetrating polymer network composition which can be formed in different shapes such as film, sheet, slab and encapsulant.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a process for preparing chlorinated rubber-polyurethane semi-interpenetrating polymer network composition which is cheaper, simple and easy to adopt.<br>
STATEMENT OF INVENTION<br>

network composition which has high damping factor for mechanical vibrations. The proposed material has high damping factor for the mechanical vibrations pertaining to a wide range of frequencies from I Hz to 10 kHz and is effective over a wide range of operating temperatures from 25 to 85°C. The composition can be formed in different shapes such as film, sheet, slab, encapsulant thereby enhancing its applications. The proposed material has least oil swellability and as such it does not adversely affect the stability of the composition over a period of time. The process is simple and cheaper and easy to adopt. The process comprises the steps of preparation of modified castor oil, mixing of modified castor oil with chlorinated rubber resin, mixing of methylene bis 4,4' diphenyl disocyanate (MDI) , and curing of the mixture.<br>
The process of preparing chlorinated rubber polyurethane semi-interpenetrating polymer network composition comprises of following steps.<br>
(i) Preparation of Modified Castor Oil<br>
Polyethylene Glycol 200 (weight wise 1- 5%), Glycerol (weight wise 6-9%), are mixed with castor oil (weight wise 86-93%) in a container. The mixture is transferred in glass vessel fitted with condenser and mechanical stirrer. The glass vessel is placed over heating mantle/oil bath, maintained at about 160°C and the contents are stirred continuously for about 7 hrs. Intermittent vacuum (3-4 mm of Hg) is applied to remove moisture, if any. The modified castor oil (MCO) thus obtained is estimated for its hydroxyl value using standard technique. The hydroxyl value lies in the range of 265-325.<br>
(ii) Mixing of Modified Castor Oil with Chlorinated Rubber Resin<br>
Chlorinated rubber resin (5-25 % weight wise) is dissolved in suitable solvents such as xylene, toluene, Methyle isobutyl Ketone etc and the solution is taken in a container. Modified castor oil prepared in above manner (45-60 % weight wise) is added to it with continuous stirring.<br>
(iii) Mixing of Methvlene Bis 4.4' Diphenvl Disocvanate (MDI)<br>
Methylene bis 4,4' diphenyl disocyanate (MDI) (about 10% over the batch) is added to above solution. The mixture was stirred for 2-3 minutes for homogenous mixing.<br>
(iv) Curing of Mixture<br>
The homogeneous mixture, prepared in above manner is poured on a glass plate and is allowed to dry at ambient temperature for 24 hrs followed by drying in oven at around 60°C for about 6 hrs. The final product, thus obtained is transparent and flexible in nature.<br>
The process of the present invention will now be illustrated with a working example which is intended to be a typical example to illustrate the working of the invention and is not intended to be taken restricti vely to imply any limitation on the scope of the present invention.<br>
WORKING EXAMPLE;<br>
Polyethylene Glycol 200 (1.6 gm), Glycerol (7 gm), are mixed with castor oil (91.4 gm) in a container. The mixture is transferred in glass vessel fitted with condenser and mechanical stirrer. The glass vessel is placed over heating mantle/oil bath, maintained at about 160°C and the contents are stirred continuously for about 7 hrs. Intermittent vacuum (3-4 mm of Hg) is applied to remove moisture, if any. The modified castor oil (MCO) thus obtained is estimated for its hydroxyl value using standard technique. The hydroxyl value lies in the range of 265-325. Chlorinated rubber resin (24 gm) is dissolved in Methyle isobutyl Ketone (80ml) and the solution is taken in a container. Modified castor oil prepared in above manner (45 gm) is added to it with continuous stirring. Methylene bis 4,4' diphenyl disocyanate (MDI) (31 gm) is added to above solution. The mixture was stirred for 2-3 minutes for homogenous mixing. The homogeneous mixture, prepared in above manner is poured on a glass plate and is allowed to dry at ambient temperature for 24 hrs followed by drying in oven at around 60°C for about 6 hrs. The final product, thus obtained is transparent and flexible in nature. The final film of chlorinated rubber-polyurethane semi interpenetrating polymer network is characterised for damping by employing dynamic mechanical thermal analyser. The film is also characterised for solvent resistant<br>
properties utilising standard techniques. There was no swelling of the film in engine oil even after 7 days of exposure. The dynamic mechanical properties for a range of varying compositions of chlorinated rubber (CR) and castor oil based polyurethane (CO-PU) IPNs have been evaluated for the representative composition of example which are tabulated as under:-<br>
Composition	Dynamic modulus   tan max Temp, for    Half peak<br>
% CR in CO-PU/CR       at 65°C(MPa)	tan max         width (°C)<br>
24	158	0.59        70	33<br>
From the above table it is clear that the proposed IPN composition can be effectively used as damper of mechanical vibrations over a wide range of temperature and frequency.<br><br>
