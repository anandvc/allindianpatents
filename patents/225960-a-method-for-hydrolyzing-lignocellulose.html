				<td>A METHOD FOR HYDROLYZING LIGNOCELLULOSE<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
Methods to enhance the production of free sugars and oligosaccharides from<br>
plant material are provided.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Plant biomass is comprised of sugars and represents the greatest source of<br>
renewable hydrocarbon on earth. However, this enormous resource is under-utilized<br>
because the sugars are locked in complex polymers. These complex polymers are<br>
often referred to collectively as lignocellulose. Sugars generated from degradation of<br>
plant biomass could provide plentiful, economically competitive feedstocks for<br>
fermentation into chemicals, plastics, and fuels, including ethanol as a substitute for<br>
petroleum.<br>
Commercial ethanol production in the U.S. is currently carried out in dry mill<br>
facilities, converting corn grain to ethanol. However corn grain is expensive, and has<br>
other high value uses, such as use in livestock feeds, and high fructose com syrups<br>
(Wyman, ed. (1999) Handbook on Bioethanol: Production, and Utilization. Taylor &amp;<br>
Francis, Washington, D.C., p.l). Alternate feedstocks for ethanol production that<br>
allow production at a lower cost, and on a larger commercial scale, are desirable.<br>
Lignocellulosics such as corn stover, which is cheap, abundant, and has no<br>
competing markets, would be preferred over grain for the production of ethanol. The<br>
limiting factor is the complex composition of the sugar polymers. Starch in corn<br>
grain is a highly branched, water-soluble polymer that is amenable to enzyme<br>
digestion. In contrast, the carbohydrates comprising lignocellulosic materials such as<br>
com stover are more difficult to digest. These carbohydrates are principally found as<br>
complex polymers including cellulose, hemicellulose and glucans, which form the<br>
structural components of plant cell walls and woody tissues. Starch and cellulose are<br>
both polymers of glucose.<br><br>
Current processes to release the sugars in lignocellulose involve many steps.<br>
A key step in the process is a harsh pretreatment. The aim of the current industry<br>
pretreatment is to increase the accessibility of cellulose to cellulose-hydrolyzing<br>
enzymes, such as the cellulase mixture derived from fermentation of the fungus<br>
Trichoderma reesei. Current pretreatment processes involve partial hydrolysis of<br>
lignocellulosic material, such as corn stover, in strong acids or bases under high<br>
temperatures and pressures. Such chemical pretreatments degrade hemicellulose<br>
and/or lignin components of lignocellulose to expose cellulose, but also create<br>
unwanted by-products such as acetic acid, furfural, and hydroxymethyl furfural.<br>
These products must be removed in additional processes to allow subsequent<br>
degradation of cellulose with enzymes or by a co-fermentation process known as<br>
simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF).<br>
The harsh conditions needed for chemical pretreatments require expensive<br>
reaction vessels, and are energy intensive. Since the chemical treatment occurs at<br>
temperature and pH conditions (for example 160Â°C and 0.2% sulfuric acid at 12 aim.<br>
pressure) incompatible with known cellulosic enzymes, and produces compounds that<br>
must be removed before fermentation, this process must occur in separate reaction<br>
vessels from cellulose degradation, and must occur prior to cellulose degradation.<br>
Thus, novel methods that are more compatible with the cellulose degradation process,<br>
that do not generate toxic waste products, and that require less energy would be<br>
desirable. Further, enzymatic processes that occur in conditions similar to those used<br>
for cellulose degradation would allow development of co-treatment processes wherein<br>
the breakdown of hemicellulose and cellulose occur in the same reaction vessel, or are<br>
not separated in the manner in which current pre-treatment processes must be<br>
separated from cellulose breakdown and subsequent processes. In addition, processes<br>
that liberate sugars from lignocellulose without generating toxic products may provide<br>
additional benefits due to the increased accessibility of nutrients present in<br>
lignocellulosic material such as proteins, amino acids, lipids, and the like.<br>
For these reasons, efficient methods are needed for conversion of<br>
lignocellulose to sugars and fermentation feedstocks.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION<br>
Methods are provided for hydrolyzing lignocellulose with increased efficiency<br>
without the need for a harsh pretreatment. These methods involve a chemical<br>
treatment of the lignocellulose at mild or moderate conditions to generate a treated<br>
lignocellulose, and contacting this treated lignocellulose with at least one enzyme<br>
capable of hydrolyzing a component of lignocellulose. The chemical treatment<br>
involves contacting lignocellulose with at least one chemical that acts in combination<br>
with enzyme treatment to liberate sugars.<br>
Methods are also provided for pretreating a lignocellulosic material<br>
comprising contacting the material with at least one chemical under mild or moderate<br>
conditions to generate a treated lignocellulose. In some embodiments, the treated<br>
lignocellulose may be farther treated with at least one enzyme capable of hydrolyzing<br>
lignocellulose.<br>
Methods for liberating substances from lignocellulosic material are also<br>
encompassed. These methods comprise a chemical treatment of the lignocellulosic<br>
material under mild or moderate conditions. In some embodiments, at least one<br>
enzyme capable of hydrolyzing lignocellulose may be added subsequent to the<br>
chemical treatment. Enzymes, Pharmaceuticals, and nutraceuticals may be released by<br>
treating lignocellulosic material by the methods of the invention. In some<br>
embodiments, the lignocellulosic material has been engineered to contain the<br>
substance to be released.<br>
Chemicals for use in the above methods include oxidizing agents, denaturants,<br>
detergents, organic solvents, bases, or any combination thereof.<br>
Methods for hydrolyzing lignocellulose comprising contacting the<br>
lignocellulose with an oxidizing agent to generate a treated lignocellulose, and<br>
contacting the treated lignocellulose with at least one enzyme capable of hydrolyzing<br>
lignocellulose are also provided.<br>
Further provided are methods for hydrolyzing lignocellulose, comprising<br>
contacting the lignocellulose with a base at a pH of about 9.0 to about 14.0 to generate<br>
a treated lignocellulose, and contacting the treated lignocellulose with at least one<br>
enzyme capable of hydrolyzing lignocellulose.<br>
Enzymes used in the methods of the invention can react with any component<br>
of the lignocellulose and include, but are not limited to, cellulases, xylanases,<br><br>
ligninases, amylases, glucuronidases, lipases, and proteases. The enzyme may be<br>
added prior to the treatment, subsequent to the treatment, or simultaneously with the<br>
chemical treatment. Further, methods that include more than one chemical treatment,<br>
either prior to or in concert with the enzyme reaction, as well as more than one<br>
enzyme treatment are provided. Multiple rounds of chemical treatment and enzyme<br>
addition are encompassed, comprising any number of treatments, in any order. The<br>
lignocellulose may be subjected to one or more physical treatments, or contact with<br>
metal ions, ozone, or ultraviolet light prior to, during, or subsequent to any treatment.<br>
The methods of the invention may further comprise the addition of at least one<br>
fermenting organism, resulting in the production of at least one fermentation-based<br>
product. Such products include, but are not limited to, lactic acid, fuels, organic<br>
acids, industrial enzymes, Pharmaceuticals, and amino acids.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
The present invention is drawn to several methods for hydrolyzing<br>
lignocellulose and the generation of sugars therefrom that are more economical, more<br>
efficient and less toxic than previously described treatments or pretreatments. One<br>
method involves a chemical treatment of the lignocellulose at mild or moderate<br>
treatment temperatures, pressures and/or pH ranges to form a treated lignocellulose,<br>
and contacting the treated lignocellulose with at least one enzyme capable of<br>
hydrolyzing lignocellulose.<br><br>
Methods for pretreating a lignocellulosic material comprising contacting the<br>
material under mild or moderate conditions with at least one chemical are also<br>
provided. The treated lignocellulosic material may be further subjected to treatment<br>
with at least one enzyme capable of hydrolyzing lignocellulose.<br>
Further provided are methods for liberating a substance from a lignocellulosic<br>
material comprising contacting the material with at least one chemical under mild or<br>
moderate conditions to generate a treated lignocellulosic material. The treated<br>
material may further be contacted with at least one enzyme capable of hydrolyzing<br>
lignocellulose. The lignocellulosic material may already comprise an enzyme capable<br>
of hydrolyzing lignocellulose.. This lignocellulosic material comprising an enzyme<br>
may further be contacted with at least one enzyme capable of hydrolyzing<br>
lignocellulose.<br>
In some embodiments, the plant material comprises a plant that has been<br>
genetically engineered to express at least one enzyme capable of hydrolyzing<br>
lignocellulose. In further embodiments, the plant material may be incubated under<br>
conditions that allow expression of the enzyme prior to chemical treatment<br>
Expression of the enzyme may lead to hydrolysis of the lignocellulose prior to<br>
chemical treatment. In addition, one or more subsequent enzyme treatments may<br>
occur. Substances that may be liberated from plant material include, but are not<br>
limited to, enzymes, Pharmaceuticals, and nutraceuticals. In addition, the plant<br>
material may or may not be genetically engineered to express the substance.<br>
In any of the above methods, the chemical may be an oxidizing agent, a<br>
denaturant, a detergent, an organic solvent, a base, or any combination thereof.<br>
In addition, methods for hydrolyzing lignocellulose comprising contacting the<br>
lignocellulose under any treatment conditions with at least one oxidizing agent to<br>
generate a treated lignocellulose, and contacting the treated lignocellulose with at<br>
least one enzyme capable of hydrolyzing lignocellulose are provided. The oxidizing<br>
agent may be a hypochlorite, hypochlorous acid, chlorine, nitric acid, a peroxyacid,<br>
peroxyacetic acid, a persulfate, a percarbonate, a permanganate, osmium tetraoxide,<br>
chromium oxide, sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate, or a compound capable of<br>
generating oxygen radicals.<br>
Further provided are methods for hydrolyzing lignocellulose comprising<br>
contacting the lignocellulose with a base at a pH of about 9.0 to about 14.0 to generate<br><br>
a treated lignocellulose, and contacting the treated lignocellulose with at least one<br>
enzyme capable of hydrolyzing lignocellulose. This method encompasses treatment<br>
conditions comprising any range of temperature or pressure. It is recognized that for<br>
this method as well as the method using an oxidizing agent that mild or moderate<br>
treatment conditions may be used.<br>
It is recognized that the enzyme or enzymes may be added at the same time,<br>
prior to, or following the addition of the chemical solutions). When added<br>
simultaneously, the chemical or chemical combination will be compatible with the<br>
enzymes selected for use in the treatment process. When the enzymes are added<br>
following the treatment with the chemical solution(s), the conditions (such as<br>
temperature and pH) may be altered prior to enzyme addition. In one embodiment,<br>
the pH is adjusted to be optimal for the enzyme or enzymes prior to enzyme addition.<br>
In another embodiment, the temperature is adjusted to be optimal for the enzyme or<br>
enzymes prior to enzyme addition. Multiple rounds of chemical treatments can be<br>
performed, with or without subsequent or simultaneous enzyme additions. In<br>
addition, multiple rounds of enzyme addition are also encompassed.<br>
'Treated lignocellulose" or "treated lignocellulosic material" or "treated<br>
material" is defined as lignocellulose that has been at least partially hydrolyzed by<br>
some form of chemical or physical treatment during a 'treatment process' or<br>
'treatment'. Typically, one or more of the polymer components is hydrolyzed during<br>
the treatment so that other components are more accessible for downstream<br>
applications. Alternatively, a treatment process can alter the structure of<br>
lignocellulose so that it is more digestible by enzymes following treatment in the<br>
absence of hydrolysis. The lignocellulose may have been previously treated to release<br>
some or all of the sugars.<br>
By "mild treatment" or "mild conditions" is intended a treatment at a<br>
temperature of about 20Â° C to about 80Â°C, at a pressure less than about 2 atm, and a<br>
pH between about pH 5.0 and about pH 8.0. By "moderate treatment" or "moderate<br>
conditions" is intended at least one of the following conditions: a temperature of<br>
about 10Â°C to about 90Â°C, a pressure less than about 2 atm, and a pH between about<br>
pH 4.0 and about pH 10.0. When the treatment is performed under moderate<br>
conditions, two of the three parameters may fall outside the ranges listed for moderate<br>
conditions. For example, if the temperature is about 10Â°C to about 90Â°C, the pH and<br><br>
pressure may be unrestricted. If the pH is between about 4.0 and about 10.0, the<br>
temperature and pressure may be unrestricted. If the pressure is less than about 2.0<br>
atm., the pH and temperature may be unrestricted.<br>
By "chemical" or "chemical solution" is intended an oxidizing agent,<br>
denaturant, detergent, organic solvent, base, or any combination of these. By<br>
"oxidizing agent" is intended a substance that is capable of increasing the oxidation<br>
state of a molecule. Oxidizing agents act by accepting electrons from other<br>
molecules, becoming reduced in the process. Oxidizing agents include, but are not<br>
limited to, hydrogen peroxide, urea hydrogen peroxide, benzoyl peroxide,<br>
superoxides, potassium superoxide, hypochlorites, hypochlorous acid, chlorine, nitric<br>
acid, peroxyacids, peroxyacetic acid, persulfates, percarbonates, permanganates,<br>
osmium tetraoxide, chromium oxide, and sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate.<br>
Oxidizing agents include peroxide-containing structures as well as compounds<br>
capable of generating oxygen radicals. By "peroxide-containing structure" is<br>
intended a compound containing the divalent ion -O-O-.<br>
By "denaturant" is intended a compound that disrupts the structure of a<br>
protein, carbohydrate, or nucleic acid. Denaturants include hydrogen bond-<br>
disrupting agents. By "hydrogen bond-disrupting agents" or "hydrogen bond<br>
disrupter" is intended a chemical or class of chemicals known to disrupt hydrogen<br>
bonding, and/or to prevent formation of hydrogen bonds, and/or to prevent re-<br>
formation after disruption. Hydrogen bond-disrupting agents include, but are not<br>
limited to, chaotropic agents, such as urea, guanidimium hydrochloride, and amine<br>
oxides, such as N-methylmorpholine N-oxide.<br>
By "detergent" is intended a compound that can form micelles to sequester<br>
oils. Detergents include anionic, cationic, or neutral detergents, including, but not<br>
limited to, Nonidet (N) P-40, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), sulfobetaine, n-<br>
octylglucoside, deoxycholate, Triton X-100, and Tween 20. Included in the definition<br>
are surfactants. By "surfactant" is intended a compound that can lower the surface<br>
tension of water.<br>
By "organic solvent" is intended a solution comprised in the greatest amount<br>
by a carbon-containing compound. Organic solvents include, but are not limited to,<br>
dimethyl formamide, dimethylsulfoxide, and methanol.<br><br>
By "base" is intended a chemical species that donates electrons or hydroxide<br>
ions or that accepts protons. Bases include, but are not limited to, sodium carbonate,<br>
potassium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide,<br>
aluminum hydroxide, lithium hydroxide, cesium hydroxide, rubidium hydroxide,<br>
barium hydroxide, strontium hydroxide, tin (II) hydroxide, and iron hydroxide.<br>
The chemical or chemicals may be removed or diluted from the treated<br>
lignocellulose prior to enzyme addition or additional chemical treatment. This may<br>
assist in optimizing conditions for enzyme activity, or subsequent microbial growth.<br>
Alternatively, a small amount of at least one enzyme may be incubated with the<br>
treated lignocellulose, prior to contact with a larger amount of at least one enzyme.<br>
The chemical may be removed or diluted prior to addition of the larger amount of<br>
enzyme. The removal or dilution may occur by any method known in the art,<br>
including, but not limited to, washing, gravity flow, pressure, and filtration. The<br>
chemical or chemicals that are removed from the treated lignocellulose (thereby<br>
defined as a "recycled chemical") may be reused in one or more subsequent<br>
incubations.<br>
Further, the method may be performed one or more times in whole or in part.<br>
That is, one may perform one or more reactions with a chemical solution, or<br>
individual chemicals, followed by one or more enzyme treatment reactions. The<br>
chemicals or chemical solutions may be added in a single dose, or may be added in a<br>
series of small doses. Further, the entire process may be repeated one or more times<br>
as necessary. Therefore, one or more additional treatments with chemical or enzyme<br>
are encompassed.<br>
The methods result in the production of soluble materials, including<br>
hydrolyzed sugars (hydrolyzate), and insoluble materials. During, or subsequent to<br>
such treatments, the liquid containing soluble materials may be removed, for example<br>
by a batch method, by a continuous method, or by a fed-batch method. The sugars<br>
may be separated from the soluble material and may be concentrated or purified. In<br>
addition, the treated lignocellulose, including the soluble materials and the residual<br>
solids may be subjected to processing prior to use. The soluble or insoluble materials<br>
may be removed or diluted, for example, with water or fermentation media, or the pH<br>
of the material may be modified. The removal or dilution may occur by any method<br><br>
known in the art, including, but not limited to, washing, gravity flow, pressure, and<br>
filtration. The materials may also be sterilized, for example, by filtration.<br>
Physical treatments, such as grinding, boiling, freezing, milling, vacuum<br>
infiltration, and the like may also be used with the methods of the invention. A<br>
.physical treatment such as milling allows a higher concentration of lignocellulose to<br>
be used in batch reactors. By "higher concentration" is intended up to about 20%, up<br>
to about 25%, up to about 30%, up to about 35%, up to about 40%, up to about 45%,<br>
or up to about 50% lignocellulose. The chemical and/or physical treatments can be<br>
administered concomitantly or sequentially with respect to the treatment methods of<br>
the invention. The lignocellulose may also be contacted with a metal ion, ultraviolet<br>
light, ozone, and the like. These treatments may enhance the effect of the chemical<br>
treatment for some materials by inducing hydroxyl radical formation. The methods of<br>
the invention can be carried out in any suitable container including vats, commercial<br>
containers, bioreactors, batch reactors, fermentation tanks or vessels. During the<br>
treatment of the invention, the reaction mixture may be agitated or stirred.<br>
The methods of the invention improve the efficiency of biomass conversion to<br>
simple sugars and oligosaccharides. Efficient biomass conversion will reduce the<br>
costs of sugars that can then be converted to useful fermentation based products. By<br>
"fermentation-based product" is intended a product produced by chemical conversion<br>
or fermentation. Such products include, but are not limited to, specialty chemicals,<br>
chemical feedstocks, plastics, solvents and fuels. Specific products that may be<br>
produced by the methods of the invention include, but not limited to, biofuels<br>
(including ethanol); lactic acid; plastics; specialty chemicals; organic acids, including<br>
citric acid, succinic acid and maleic acid; solvents; animal feed supplements;<br>
Pharmaceuticals; vitamins; amino acids, such as lysine, methionine, tryptophan,<br>
threonine, and aspartic acid; industrial enzymes, such as proteases, cellulases,<br>
amylases, glucanases, lactases, Upases, lyases, oxidoreductases, and transferases; and<br>
chemical feedstocks. The methods of the invention are also useful to generate<br>
feedstocks for fermentation by fermenting microorganisms. In one embodiment, the<br>
method further comprises the addition of at least one fermenting organism. By<br>
"fermenting organism" is intended an organism capable of fermentation, such as<br>
bacteria and fungi, including yeast. Such feedstocks have additional nutritive value<br>
above the nutritive value provided by the liberated sugars.<br><br>
rhe methods of the invention are also useful for the development or<br>
modification of methods to process lignocellulosic materials. The methods are useful<br>
to modify or improve handling characteristics of lignocellulose-containing materials<br>
such as viscosity, as well as reduce feedstock bulk and particle size, which can be<br>
useful in liberation of sugars, use as a feedstock, or in preparation of the<br>
lignocellulose for use of further methods. Further, the methods of the invention can<br>
be used to reduce waste bulk, and to improve waste properties from industrial<br>
processes that generate lignocellulosic waste. Particularly the methods will be useful<br>
to reduce water content, and/or increase dryability, nutritive value or composition.<br>
In one embodiment, the chemical treatment reduces the number of biological<br>
contaminants present in the lignocellulosic feedstock. This may result in sterilization<br>
of the feedstock. (See Example 9 in the Experimental section).<br>
Treatment conditions<br>
The enzymes are reacted with substrate under mild or moderate conditions that<br>
do not include extreme heat or acid treatment as is currently utilized for biomass<br>
conversion using bioreactors. For example, enzymes can be incubated at about 20Â°C<br>
to about 80'C, preferably about 30Â°C to about 65Â°C, more preferably about 37Â°C to<br>
about 45Â°C, more preferably about 37Â°C, about 38Â°C, about 39'C, about 40Â°C, about<br>
41Â°C, about 42Â°C, about 43Â°C, about 44Â°C, about 45Â°C, about 46Â°C, about 47Â°C, about<br>
48Â°C, about 49Â°C, about 50Â°C, about 51 Â°C, about 52Â°C, about 53Â°C, about 54Â°C, about<br>
55Â°C, about 56Â°C, about 57Â°C, about 58Â°C, about 59Â°C, about 60Â°C, about 61Â°C, about<br>
62Â°C, about 63Â°C, about 64Â°C, about 65Â°C, in buffers of low to medium ionic<br>
strength, and neutral pH. Surprisingly the chemical treatment is capable of releasing<br>
or liberating a substantial amount of the sugars. By "substantial" amount is intended<br>
at least about 20%, about 30%, about 40%, about 50%, about 60%, about 70%, about<br>
80%, about 85%, about 90%, about 95% and greater of available sugar.<br>
The temperature of the chemical treatment may range from about 10Â°C to<br>
about 100Â°C or greater, about 10Â° to about 90Â°, about 20Â°C to about 80Â°C, about 30Â°C<br>
to about 70Â°C, about 40Â°C to about 60Â°C, about 37Â°C to about 50Â°C, preferably about<br>
37 Â°C to about 100 Â°C, more preferably about 50 Â°C to about 90 Â°C, most preferably<br>
less man about 90Â°C, or less than about 80Â°C, or about 80Â°C. The method of the<br>
invention can be performed at many different temperatures but it is preferred that the<br><br>
treatment occur at the temperature best suited to the enzyme being used, or the<br>
predicted enzyme optimum of the enzymes to be used. In the absence of data on the<br>
temperature optimum, one may perform the treatment reactions at 50Â°C first, then at<br>
higher or lower temperatures. Comparison of the results of the assay results from this<br>
test will allow one to modify the method to best suit the enzymes being tested. The<br>
pH of the treatment mixture may range from about pH 2.0 to about pH 14.0, but when<br>
the chemical is an oxidizing agent, denaturant, detergent, or organic solvent, the pH is<br>
preferably about 3.0 to about 7.0, more preferably about 3.0 to about 6.0, even more<br>
preferably about 3.0, about 5.0, about 3.5, about 4.0, about 4.5, or about 5.0. When<br>
the chemical is a base, the pH is preferably about pH 9.0 to about pH 14.0, more<br>
preferably about pH 10.0 to about pH 13.0, even more preferably about pH 11.0 to<br>
about pH 12.5, most preferably about pH 12.0. Again, the pH may be adjusted to<br>
maximize enzyme activity and may be adjusted with the addition of an enzyme or<br>
enzyme mixture, or prior to enzyme addition.<br>
The final concentration of chemical may range from about 0.1% to about 10%,<br>
preferably about 0.3% to about 8%, more preferably about 0.3% to about 5.0%, or<br>
about 0.4% to about 3.0%, even more preferably, about 0.5% about 0.6%, about 0.7%,<br>
about 0.8%, about 0.9%, about 1.0%. The concentration of lignocellulose may be<br>
about 1% to about 60%, preferably about 10% to about 40%, more preferably about<br>
20%, about 25%, about 30%, about 35%. The treatment reaction may occur from<br>
several minutes to several hours, such as for at least about 8 hours to at least about 48<br>
hours, more preferably at least about 12 hours to at least about 36 hours, for at least<br>
about 16 hours to at least about 24 hours, for at least about 20 hours, more preferably<br>
for at least about 10 hours, most preferably for at least about 10 minutes, at least about<br>
20 minutes, at least about 30 minutes, at least about 1 hour, at least about 1.5 hours, at<br>
least about 2.0 hours, at least about 2.5 hours, at least about 3 hours. The reaction<br>
may take place from about 0 to about 2 aim. m order to determine optimal reaction<br>
conditions (including optimal amount of chemical and substrate loads, optimal length<br>
of incubation, optimal temperature, pH, buffer, and pressure), aliquots of the mixtures<br>
can be taken at various time points before and after addition of the assay constituents,<br>
and the release of sugars can be measured by the modified DNS assay described in<br>
U.S. Application No. 60/432,750, herein incorporated by reference.<br><br>
In one embodiment, the methods involve a chemical treatment of the<br>
lignocellulose at a temperature from about 0Â°C to about 100Â°C, at a pressure less than<br>
about 2 atm., and at a pH between about pH 2.0 and about pH 14.0. hi other<br>
embodiments, at least one of these conditions is sufficient for hydrolyzing<br>
lignocellulose. hi still other embodiments, at least two of these conditions are<br>
sufficient for hydrolyzing lignocellulose.<br>
In one aspect of the invention the lignocellulosic substrates or plant biomass,<br>
is degraded and converted to simple sugars and oligosaccharides for the production of<br>
ethanol or other useful products. Sugars released from biomass can be converted to<br>
useful fermentation products including but not limited to amino acids, vitamins,<br>
Pharmaceuticals, animal feed supplements, specialty chemicals, chemical feedstocks,<br>
plastics or other organic polymers, lactic acid, and ethanol, including fuel ethanol.<br>
hi contrast to current methods, complex mixtures of polymeric carbohydrates<br>
and lignin, or actual lignocellulose can be used as the substrate hydrolyzed by<br>
biomass conversion enzymes. A specific assay has been developed to measure the<br>
release of sugars and oligosaccharides from these complex substrates. The assay uses<br>
any complex lignocellulosic material, including com stover, sawdust, woodchips, and<br>
the like, hi this assay the lignocellulosic material such as corn stover is incubated<br>
with enzymes(s) for various times and the released reducing sugars measured by the<br>
dinitrosalisylic acid assay as described in U.S. Provisional Application No.<br>
60/432,750. Various additional assay methods can be used, such as those that can<br>
detect reducing sugars, to quantitate the monomeric sugars or oligomers that have<br>
been solubilized as a result of the chemical treatment For example, high performance<br>
liquid chromatography (HPLC) methods allow for qualitative and quantitative<br>
analysis of monomeric sugars and oligomers.<br>
The methods of the invention are also useful to generate feedstocks for<br>
fermentation. Such feedstocks have nutritive value beyond the nutritive value<br>
provided by the liberated sugars, due to the solubilization of proteins, amino acids,<br>
lignin (carbon source), lipids and minerals (including iron). As compared to other<br>
methods for the generation of feedstocks from lignocellulosic materials, this method<br>
requires little or no cleanup of the solubles prior to fermentation. Feedstocks<br>
generated in this manner may be used for the fermentation of microorganisms such as<br>
bacteria and fungi, including yeast<br><br>
The methods of the invention are also useful for the development or<br>
modification of methods to process lignocellulosic materials. As such, these methods<br>
may produce lignocellulose streams with altered compositions, lignocellulose steams<br>
with reduced viscosity, lignocellulose streams of reduced mass, as well as<br>
lignocellulose streams of reduced water content or capacity. Furthermore, the<br>
methods are suitable for the recovery of sugars from lignocellulose streams<br>
recalcitrant to hydrolysis, including agricultural waste products. The recovery would<br>
allow sugars to be reintegrated into the feedstock flow and allow waste streams to be<br>
further reduced. Additionally, the method would allow agricultural waste streams<br>
with reduced sugar contents to be generated that are more suitable as a fibrous<br>
component for incorporation into ruminant diets.<br>
Oxidizing Agents<br>
The relative strengths of oxidizing agents (see, for example,<br>
http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/chemical/cl) can be inferred from their<br>
standard electrode potentials (see, for example, http://hyperphysics.phy-<br>
astr.gsu.edu/hbase/chemical/cl). The strongest oxidizing agents are shown from the<br>
standard electrode table (see, for example, http://hyperphysics.phy-<br>
astr.gsu.edu/hbase/tables/cl. A partial listing of oxidizing agents includes bromates;<br>
chloric acid; chlorous acid; chlorinated isocyanurates; chromates; dichromates;<br>
halogens, including fluorine, chlorine, and bromine; hypochlorites; hypochlorous<br>
acid; nitric acid; nitrates; nitrites; oxygen; perborates; perchlorates; perchloric acid;<br>
periodates; permanganates; peroxides, including hydrogen peroxide, hydroperoxides,<br>
ketone peroxides, organic peroxides, and inorganic peroxides; peroxyacids; and<br>
persulfates.<br>
Oxidizing and bleaching agents used in the paper industry include chlorine<br>
and chlorinated compounds; chlorine; sodium chlorate; sodium chlorite;<br>
hypochlorites; sodium hypochlorite; calcium hypochlorite; other hypochlorites;<br>
chloroidocyanurates; miscellaneous chlorine compounds; 1,3-dichloro-5, 5-dimethyl<br>
hydantoin (DCDMH); oxygen and oxygenated compounds; hydrogen peroxide;<br>
ozone; sodium perborate; potassium permanganate; organic peroxides; benzoyl<br>
peroxide; other organic peroxides; inorganic peroxides; sodium peroxide; calcium<br><br>
peroxide; magnesium peroxide; sodium percarbonate; other oxygenated compounds;<br>
peracetic and peroxymonosulfuric acid; metal oxyacids; and nitric and nitrous acids.<br>
Hydrogen Peroxide<br>
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is the protonated form of the peroxide ion (O22); it<br>
is synthesized by oxidation process and can be purchased commercially as a dilution<br>
in water at concentrations up to 70%. Additionally, hydrogen peroxide can also be<br>
synthesized from the one-electron reduced form of oxygen (O2), either<br>
spontaneously or by utilization of the enzyme superoxide dismutase.<br>
Hydrogen peroxide is a potent oxidizing agent. It is well known in the art that<br>
H2O2 can be reduced to the hydroxyl radical (HO) in the presence of appropriate<br>
stimulants. These stimulants include metal cations (such as Fe2+), ultraviolet light,<br>
and ozone. The hydroxyl radical is a very strong oxidative reagent.<br>
While enzymes that can hydrolyze lignocellulose are too big to penetrate plant<br>
cell walls, hydrogen peroxide molecules are small enough to pass through. In the<br>
environment, hydrogen peroxide (and hydroxyl radicals) may be responsible for<br>
digestion of plant biomass that is observed following treatment with hydrogen<br>
peroxide (see, for example, Xu and Goodell (2001) J. Biotech. 87:43-57; Green and<br>
Highley (1997) Int. Biodeterioration Biodegredation 39:113-124). Other<br>
lignocellulose treatments involving hydrogen peroxide have been either carried out<br>
under alkaline conditions, or at high temperatures, or both (see, for example, Kim et<br>
al. (1996) Appl. Biochem. Biotech. 57/58:147-156; Kim et al. (2001) Appl. Biochem.<br>
Biotech. 91-93:81-94; Doner et al. (2001); Leathers et al. (1996) Appl. Biochem.<br>
Biotech. 59:334-347).<br>
In addition to hydrogen peroxide, it is common knowledge that other<br>
compounds can generate hydroxyl radicals through various chemistries. One example<br>
is hypochlorous acid (HOC1), which can form hydroxyl radicals by reaction with<br>
electron donors such as superoxide radical (CV) or ferrous iron (Fe2+).<br>
The hydroxyl radical is one example of an oxygen radical compound that<br>
possesses oxidative properties. Other compounds mat contain an oxygen radical and<br>
possess similar properties are known in the art. These compounds include the<br>
superoxide radical (O2), singlet oxygen (1O2), nitric oxide (NO-), peroxyl radicals<br><br>
(ROO), and alkoxyl radicals (LO). One or more of these compounds may be useful<br>
in the processes of the invention.<br>
Enzyme Nomenclature and Applications<br>
The nomenclature recommendations of the IUBMB are published in Enzyme<br>
Nomenclature 1992 [Academic Press, San Diego, California, ISBN 0-12-227164-5<br>
(hardback), 0-12-227165-3 (paperback)] with Supplement 1 (1993), Supplement 2<br>
(1994), Supplement 3 (1995), Supplement 4 (1997) and Supplement 5 (in Eur. J.<br>
Biochem. (1994) 223:1-5; Ever. J. Biochem. (1995) 232:1-6; Eur. J. Biochem. (1996)<br>
237:1-5; Eur. J. Biochem. (1997) 250:1-6, andÂ£Â«r. J. Biochem. (1999) 264:610-650;<br>
respectively). The classifications recommended by the IUBMB are widely recognized<br>
and followed in the art. Typically, enzymes are referred to in the art by the IUBMB<br>
enzyme classification, or EC number. Lists of enzymes in each class are updated<br>
frequently, and are published by IUBMB in print and on the Internet.<br>
Another source for enzyme nomenclature base on IUBMB classifications can<br>
be found in the ENZYME database. ENZYME is a repository of information relative<br>
to the nomenclature of enzymes. It is primarily based on the recommendations of the<br>
Nomenclature Committee of the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular<br>
Biology (IUBMB) and it describes each type of characterized enzyme for which an<br>
EC (Enzyme Commission) number has been provided (Bairoch (2000) Nucleic Acids<br>
Res 28:304-305). The ENZYME database describes for each entry: the EC number,<br>
the recommended name, alternative names (if any), the catalytic activity, cofactors (if<br>
any), pointers to the SWISS-PROT protein sequence entries(s) that correspond to the<br>
enzyme (if any), and pointers to human diseases) associated with a deficiency of the<br>
enzyme (if any).<br>
"Cellulase" includes both exohydrolases and endohydrolases that are capable<br>
of recognizing and hydrolyzing cellulose, or products resulting from cellulose<br>
breakdown, as substrates. Cellulase includes mixtures of enzymes that include<br>
endoglucanases, cellobiohydrolases, glucosidases, or any of these enzymes alone, or<br>
in combination with other activities. Organisms producing a cellulose-hydrolyzdng<br>
activity often produce a plethora of enzymes, with different substrate specificities.<br>
Thus, a strain identified as digesting cellulose may be described as having a cellulase,<br>
when in fact several enzyme types may contribute to the activity. For example,<br><br>
commercial preparations of 'cellulase' are often mixtures of several enzymes, such as<br>
endoglucanase, exoglucanase, and glucosidase activities.<br>
Thus, "cellulase" includes mixtures of such enzymes, and includes<br>
commercial preparations capable of hydrolyzing cellulose, as well as culture<br>
supernatant or cell extracts exhibiting cellulose hydrolyzing activity, or acting on the<br>
breakdown products of cellulose degradation, such as cellotriose or cellobiose.<br>
"Endoglucanase" or "l,4-j8-D-glucan 4-glucanohydrolase" or "/3-1,4,<br>
endocellulase" or "endocellulase", or "cellulase" EC 32.1.4 includes enzymes that<br>
cleave polymers of glucose attached by |3-1,4 linkages. Substrates acted on by these<br>
enzymes include cellulose, and modified cellulose substrates such as carboxymethyl<br>
cellulose, RBB-cellulose, and the like.<br>
"Cellobiohydrolase" or "1,4, -j8-D-glucan cellobiohydrolase" or "cellulose 1,4-<br>
j8-cellobiosidase" or "cellobiosidase" includes enzymes that hydrolyze 1,4-j3-D-<br>
glucosidic linkages in cellulose and cellotetraose, releasing cellobiose from the non-<br>
reducing raids of the chains. Enzymes in group EC 3.2.1.91 include these enzymes.<br>
"j8-glucosidase" or "glucosidase" or "jS-D-glucoside glucohydrolase" or<br>
"cellobiase" EC 3.2.1.21 includes enzymes that release glucose molecules as a<br>
product of their catalytic action. These enzymes recognize polymers of glucose, such<br>
as cellobiose (a dimer of glucose linked by 0-1,4 bonds) or cellotriose (a trimer of<br>
glucose linked by 0-1, 4 bonds) as substrates. Typically they hydrolyze the terminal,<br>
non-reducing 0-D-glucose, with release of /3-D-glucose.<br><br><br>
"Xyianase" includes both exohydrolytic and endohydrolytic enzymes that are<br>
capable of recognizing and hydrolyzing xylan, or products resulting from xylan<br>
breakdown, as substrates. In monocots, where heteroxylans are the principal<br>
constituent of hemicellulose, a combination of endo-1,4-beta-xylanase (EC 3.2.1.8)<br><br>
and beta-D-xylosidase (EC 3.2.1.37) may be used to break down xylan to xylose.<br>
Additional debranching enzymes are capable of hydrolyzing other sugar components<br>
(arabinose, galactose, mannose) that are located at branch points in the xylan<br>
structure. Additional enzymes are capable of hydrolyzing bonds formed between<br>
hemicellulosic sugars (notably arabinose) and lignin.<br>
"Endoxylanase" or "l,4-ï¢-endoxylanase" or "1,4- 0-D-xylan<br>
xylanohydrolase" (EC 3.2.1.8) include enzymes that hydrolyze xylose polymers<br>
attached by 0-1,4 linkages. Endoxylanases can be used to hydrolyze the<br>
hemicellulose component of lignocellulose as well as purified xylan substrates.<br>
"Exoxylanase" or "ï¢-xylosidase" or "xylan l,4-ï¢-xylosidase" or "1,4-ï¢-D-<br>
xylan xylohydrolase" or "xylobiase" or "exo-1,4-ï¢-xylosidase" (EC 3.2.1.37)<br>
includes enzymes that hydrolyze successive D-xylose residues from the non-reducing<br>
terminus of xylan polymers.<br>
"Arabinoxylanase" or " glucuronoarabinoxylan endo-1,4-ï¢-xylanase" or<br>
"feraxan endoxylanase" includes enzymes that hydrolyze 0-1,4 xylosyl linkages in<br>
some xylan substrates.<br><br><br>
"Ligninases" includes enzymes that can hydrolyze or break down the structure<br>
of lignin polymers. Enzymes that can break down lignin include lignin peroxidases,<br>
manganese peroxidases, laccases and feruloyl esterases, and other enzymes described<br>
in the art known to depolymerize or otherwise break lignin polymers. Also included<br>
are enzymes capable of hydrolyzing bonds formed between hemicellulosic sugars<br>
(notably arabinose) and lignin.<br><br><br>
"Amylase" or "alpha glucosidase" includes enzymes that hydrolyze 1,4-alpha-<br>
glucosidic linkages in oligosaccharides and polysaccharides. Many amylases are<br>
characterized under the following EC listings:<br><br><br>
"Protease" includes enzymes that hydrolyze peptide bonds (peptidases), as<br>
well as enzymes that hydrolyze bonds between peptides and other moieties, such as<br>
sugars (glycopeptidases). Many proteases are characterized under EC 3.4, and are<br>
incorporated herein by reference. Some specific types of proteases include, cysteine<br><br>
proteases including pepsin, papain and serine proteases including chymotrypsins,<br>
carboxypeptidases andmetalloendopeptidases. The SWISS-PROT Protein<br>
Knowledgebase (maintained by the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics (SIB), Geneva,<br>
Switzerland and the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI), Hinxton, United<br>
Kingdom) classifies proteases or peptidases into the following classes.<br>

In plants, lipids are used as structural components to limit water loss and pathogen<br>
infection. These lipids include waxes derived from fatty acids, as well as cutin and<br>
suberin. Many lipases are characterized under the following EC listings:<br><br><br><br><br>
"Glucuronidase" includes enzymes that catalyze the hydrolysis of beta-<br>
glucuroniside to yield an alcohol. Many glucoronidases are characterized under the<br>

Enzyme Compositions<br>
"At least one enzyme capable of hydrolyzing lignocellulose" or "at least one<br>
enzyme" is defined as any enzyme or mixture of enzymes that increases or enhances<br>
sugar release from biomass following a 'treatment reaction'. This can include<br><br>
enzymes that when contacted with biomass in a reaction, increase the activity of<br>
subsequent enzymes. The treatment with an "enzyme" is referred to as an 'enzymatic<br>
treatment'. Enzymes with relevant activities include, but are not limited to, cellulases,<br>
xylanases, ligninases, amylases, proteases, lipases and glucuronidases. Many of these<br>
enzymes are representatives of class EC 3.2.1, and thus other enzymes in this class<br>
may be useful in this invention. Two or more enzymes may be combined to yield an<br>
"enzyme mix" to hydrolyze lignocellulose during treatment. An enzyme mix may be<br>
composed of enzymes from (1) commercial suppliers; (2) cloned genes expressing<br>
enzymes; (3) complex broth (such as that resulting from growth of a microbial strain<br>
in media, wherein the strains secrete proteins and enzymes into the media), including<br>
broth from semi-solid or solid phase media, as well as broth containing the feedstock<br>
itself; (4) cell lysates of strains grown as in (3); and, (5) plant material expressing<br>
enzymes capable of hydrolyzing lignocellulose.<br>

a lipase and a glucuronidase; at least a cellulase, a xylanase, a ligninase, a protease, a<br>

lipase and a glucuronidase; at least a cellulase, a xylanase, a ligninase, an amylase, a<br>
protease, a lipase and a glucuronidase; and the like. It is understood that as described<br>
above, an auxiliary mix may be composed of a member of each of these enzyme<br>
classes, several members of one enzyme class (such as two or more xylanases), or any<br>
combination of members of these enzyme classes (such as a protease, an exocellulase,<br>
and an endoxylanase; or a ligninase, an exoxylanase, and a lipase).<br>
The enzymes may be reacted with substrate or biomass simultaneously with<br>
the treatment or subsequent to the chemical treatment. Likewise if more than one<br>
enzyme is used the enzymes may be added simultaneously or sequentially. The<br>
enzymes may be added as a crude, semi-purified, or purified enzyme mixture. The<br>
temperature and pH of the substrate and enzyme combination may vary to increase<br>
the activity of the enzyme combinations. While the enzymes have been discussed as a<br>
mixture it is recognized that the enzymes may be added sequentially where the<br>
temperature, pH, and other conditions may be altered to increase the activity of each<br>
individual enzyme. Alternatively, an optimum pH and temperature can be determined<br>
for an enzyme mixture.<br>
The enzymes are reacted with substrate under mild conditions. By "mild<br>
conditions" is intended conditions that do not include extreme heat or acid treatment,<br>
as is currently utilized for biomass conversion using bioreactors. For example,<br>
enzymes can be incubated at about 35Â° C to about 65Â° C in buffers of low to medium<br>
ionic strength, and neutral pH. By "medium ionic strength" is intended that the buffer<br><br>
has an ion concentration of about 200 millimolar (mM) or less for any single ion<br>
component. Incubation of enzyme combinations under these conditions results in<br>
release of substantial amounts of the sugar from the lignocellulose. By substantial<br>
amount or significant percentage is intended at least about 20%, about 30%, about<br>
40%, about 50%, about 60%, about 70%, about 80%, about 85%, about 90%, about<br>
95% and greater of available sugar.<br>
Enzyme Applications<br>
The enzyme or enzymes used in the practice of the invention may be produced<br>
exogenously in microorganisms, yeasts, fungi, bacteria or plants, then isolated and<br>
added to the lignocellulosic feedstock. Alternatively, the organism producing the<br>
enzyme may be added into the feedstock. In this manner, plants that produce the<br>
enzymes may serve as the lignocellulosic feedstock and be added into lignocellulosic<br>
feedstock. The enzymes may also be produced in a fermentation organism producing<br>
a fermentation product, by simultaneous saccharification and fermentation.<br>
Enzymes that degrade cellulose and hemicellulose are prevalent in nature,<br>
enabling organisms that produce them to degrade the more than 40 billion tons of<br>
cellulose biomass produced each year. Degradation of cellulose is a process that can<br>
involve as many as three distinct activities: 1) endoglucanases (EC 3.2.1.4), which<br>
cleave cellulose polymers internally; 2) cellobiohydrolases (EC 3.2.1.91), which<br>
attack cellulose polymers at non-reducing ends of the polymer, and, 3) beta-<br>
glucosidases (EC3.2.1.21), which cleave cellobiose dimers into glucose monomers<br>
and can cleave other small cellodextrins into glucose monomers. With these activities<br>
cellulose can be converted to glucose.<br>
Likewise, hemicellulose can be converted to simple sugars and<br>
oligosaccharides by enzymes. In monocots, where heteroxylans are the principal<br>
constituent of hemicellulose, a combination of endo-1,4-beta-xylanase (EC 3.2.1.8)<br>
and beta-D-xylosidase (EC 3.2.1.37) may be used to break down hemicellulose to<br>
xylose. The mixed beta glucans are hydrolyzed by beta (1,3), (1,4) glucanases (EC<br>
3.2.1.73).<br>
Enzymes affecting biomass conversion are produced naturally in a wide range<br>
of organisms. Common sources are microorganisms including Trichoderma and<br>
Aspergillus species for cellulases and xylanases, and white rot fungi for ligninases.<br><br>
There are many organisms that have been noted to produce cellulases,<br>
cellobiohydrolases, glucosidases, xylanases, xylosidases, and ligninases. However,<br>
most of these enzymes have not been tested for their ability to degrade plant biomass,<br>
especially com stover. Thus, the method of the invention can be used to test the use of<br>
enzymes in hydrolyzing corn stover and other lignocellulosic material.<br>
As previously indicated, the enzymes or enzyme combinations can be<br>
expressed in microorganisms, yeasts, fungi or plants. Methods for the expression of<br>
the enzymes are known in the art. See, for example, Sambrook et al. (1989)<br>
Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual (2d ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory<br>
Press, Plainview, New York); Ausubel et al, eds. (1995) Current Protocols in<br>
Molecular Biology (Greene Publishing and Wiley-Interscience, New York); U.S.<br>
Patent Nos: 5,563,055; 4,945,050; 5,886,244; 5,736,369; 5,981,835; and others<br>
known in the art, all of which are herein incorporated by reference.<br>
In one aspect of this invention the enzymes are produced in transgenic plants.<br>
Thus, the plant material comprising the lignocellulose may already comprise at least<br>
one enzyme capable of hydrolyzing lignocellulose. The lignocellulose may be<br>
incubated under conditions that allow the enzyme to hydrolyze lignocellulose prior to<br>
addition of the chemical. In addition, the lignocellulose may be subjected to<br>
processing, such as by modification of pH or washing, prior to addition of a chemical,<br>
or prior to any enzyme treatment. In this method the plants express the enzyme(s)<br>
that are required or contribute to biomass conversion to simple sugars or<br>
oligosaccharides. Such enzyme or enzyme combinations are sequestered or inactive to<br>
prevent hydrolysis of the plant during plant growth. In some cases where multiple<br>
enzymes display synergistic activity, one or more enzymes could be produced in the<br>
plant serving as the lignocellulosic feedstock and other enzymes produced in<br>
microorganism, yeast, fungi or another plant than the different enzyme sources mixed<br>
together with the feedstock to achieve the final synergistic mix of enzymes.<br>
Biomass Substrate Definitions<br>
By "substrate", "lignocellulose", or "biomass" is intended materials containing<br>
cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin, protein, ash, and carbohydrates, such as starch and<br>
sugar. Component simple sugars include glucose, xylose, arabinose, mannose, and<br>
galactose. "Biomass" includes virgin biomass and/or non-virgin biomass such as<br><br>
agricultural biomass, commercial organics, construction and demolition debris,<br>
municipal solid waste, waste paper and yard waste. Common forms of biomass<br>
include trees, shrubs and grasses, wheat, wheat straw, sugar cane bagasse, corn, corn<br>
husks, corn kernel including fiber from kernels, products and by-products from<br>
milling of grains such as corn (including wet milling and dry milling) as well as<br>
municipal solid waste, waste paper and yard waste. "Blended biomass" is any mixture<br>
or blend of virgin and non-virgin biomass, preferably having about 5-95% by weight<br>
non-virgin biomass. "Agricultural biomass" includes branches, bushes, canes, com<br>
and corn husks, energy crops, forests, fruits, flowers, grains, grasses, herbaceous<br>
crops, leaves, bark, needles, logs, roots, saplings, short rotation woody corps, shrubs,<br>
switch grasses, trees, vegetables, vines, and hard and soft woods (not including woods<br>
with deleterious materials). In addition, agricultural biomass includes organic waste<br>
materials generated from agricultural processes including farming and forestry<br>
activities, specifically including forestry wood waste. Agricultural biomass may be<br>
any of the aforestated singularly or in any combination of mixture thereof.<br>
Biomass high in starch, sugar, or protein such as corn, grains, fruits and<br>
vegetables are usually consumed as food. Conversely, biomass high in cellulose,<br>
hemicellulose and lignin are not readily digestible and are primarily utilized for wood<br>
and paper products, fuel, or are typically disposed. Generally, the substrate is of high<br>
lignocellulose content, including corn stover, com fiber, Distiller's dried grains, rice<br>
straw, hay, sugarcane bagasse, wheat, oats, barley malt and other agricultural<br>
biomass, switchgrass, forestry wastes, poplar wood chips, pine wood chips, sawdust,<br>
yard waste, and the like, including any combination of substrate.<br>
Biomass may be used as collected from the field, or it may be processed, for<br>
example by milling, grinding, shredding, etc. Further, biomass may be treated by<br>
chemical or physical means prior to uses, for example by hearing, drying, freezing, or<br>
by ensiling (storing for period of time at high moisture content). Such treatments<br>
include storage as bales, in open pits, as well as storage in reactors designed to result<br>
in modified properties such as microbial count or content, pH, water content, etc.<br><br><br>
By "liberate" or "hydrolysis" is intended the conversion of complex<br>
lignocellulosic substrates or biomass to simple sugars and oligosaccharides.<br>
"Conversion" includes any biological, chemical and/or bio-chemical activity<br>
that produces ethanol or ethanol and byproducts from biomass and/or blended<br>
biomass. Such conversion includes hydrolysis, fermentation and simultaneous<br>
saccharification and fermentation (SSF) of such biomass and/or blended biomass.<br>
Preferably, conversion includes the use of fermentation materials and hydrolysis<br>
materials as defined herein.<br>
"Com stover" includes agricultural residue generated by harvest of corn<br>
plants. Stover is generated by harvest of corn grain from a field of corn, typically by a<br>
combine harvester. Corn stover includes corn stalks, husks, roots, corn grain, and<br>
miscellaneous material such as soil in varying proportions.<br>
"Corn fiber" is a fraction of com grain, typically resulting from wet milling or<br>
other corn grain processing. The corn fiber fraction contains the fiber portion of the<br>
harvested grain remaining after extraction of starch and oils. Corn fiber typically<br>
contains hemicellulose, cellulose, residual starch, protein and lignin.<br>
"Ethanol" includes ethyl alcohol or mixtures of ethyl alcohol and water.<br>
"Fermentation products" includes ethanol, lactic acid, citric acid, butanol and<br>
isopropanol as well as derivatives thereof.<br><br>
"Distiller's dried grains" are the dried residue remaining after the starch<br>
fraction of com has been removed for fermentation into ethanol. The material<br>
typically contains fiber, residual starch, protein and oils.<br>
"Sugarcane bagasse" is a lignocellulosic product of sugarcane processing.<br>
The bagasse typically contains approximately 65% carbohydrates in the form of<br>
cellulose and hemicellulose.<br>
"Malt" lignocellulose refers to barley malt utilized as a sugar source for<br>
brewing industries. The spent "malt" that is generated is high in cellulose, fiber and<br>
protein.<br>
The following examples are offered by way of illustration and not by way of<br>
limitation.<br>
EXPERIMENTAL<br>
Example 1. Glucose and Xylose Standard Curves<br>
Standards for glucose, xylose, arabinose, galactose and mannose were<br>
prepared at concentrations ranging from 0%- 0.12%. A modified dinitrosalicylic acid<br>
(DNS) method produced absorbance changes detected at 540 nm. A linear curve fit<br>
analysis for each sugar standard verifies mat the DNS quantitation method is a precise<br>
detection method for each monomeric sugar (data not shown).<br>
Example 2. Hydrogen Peroxide Treatment Followed by Cellulase Treatment<br>
Liberates Monomeric Sugars<br>
Hydrogen peroxide (200 mM) was reacted with 2.0 g of stover in 10 mL water<br>
(adjusted to pH 5.0). A control stover sample was untreated. After 24 hours of<br>
incubation at 80Â°C, the reducing sugar content of each sample was determined by<br>
DNS assay (Example 1). Cellulase from T. longibrachiatum (25 mg) was then added<br>
to both samples and incubation was carried out for 24 hours at 65Â°C. The reducing<br>
sugars were determined by DNS assay. The results are shown hi Table 8. Treatment<br>
with hydrogen peroxide resulted in greater sugar release after enzyme treatment than<br>
with enzyme alone.<br><br><br>
For further analysis by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC),<br>
aliquots were removed, diluted 1:250 in water, and filtered using a 0.45 ï­m filter.<br>
The solubilized sugars were then separated at basic pH using an anion exchange<br>
HPLC column. Detection was carried out using an electrochemical detector in pulsed<br>
amperometric mode. External sugar standards (glucose, xylose) were used to identify<br>
glucose and xylose peaks. A chromatogram of sugars solubilized from stover<br>
following H2O2 and cellulase treatment is shown in Figure 1.<br>
Stover<br>
Hydrogen peroxide (0 - 60 mM final concentration) was reacted with 0.2 g<br>
stover in sodium acetate buffer (125 mM, pH 5.0) and incubated at 50Â°C with<br>
shaking. After 24 hours, the reducing sugar content was determined by DNS assay.<br>
10 units of cellulase from Trichoderma reesei and 10 units of xylanase from<br>
Trichoderma viride were then added and incubation was continued for 24 hours at<br>
50Â°C. Additional aliquots were removed from each sample and reducing sugars<br>
quantified. The reducing sugar content following hydrogen peroxide treatment and<br>
enzymatic treatment is shown in Figure 2. The amount of reducing sugars released<br>
was greater with increased concentration of hydrogen peroxide.<br>
Hydrogen peroxide (0.13%) was reacted with 0.2 g stover in sodium acetate<br>
buffer (125 mM, pH 5.0) at 50Â°C with shaking. Hydrogen peroxide was detected as<br>
follows (Kotterman (1986) App. Env. Microbiol. 62:880-885). Multiple aliquots (100<br><br>
uL) from each sample were transferred to 96-well microtiter plates and mixed with 49<br>
uL of 0.06% phenol red and 1 uL of 1.5 mg/mL horseradish peroxidase and incubated<br>
for 5 minutes. Samples were then mixed with 75 uL of 4N NaOH, quantitated at 610<br>
nm, and compared to hydrogen peroxide standards. At timepoints from 0-24 hours,<br>
hydrogen peroxide and reducing sugars (DNS assay) were measured. These data are<br>
shown in Figure 3. Control samples without stover did not change in their DNS assay<br>
and peroxide assay signals, respectively (data not shown). By 24 hours, the hydrogen<br>
peroxide concentration approached zero (Figure 3). These results demonstrate mat the<br>
treatment leaves a mimimal chemical residue.<br>
Example 5. Liberation of Sugars from Many Lignocellulose Materials<br>
Lignocellulose material comprised of 1 gram of com stover, corn fiber,<br>
Distiller's dried grains, Barley malt, or Sugarcane bagasse was mixed with hydrogen<br>
peroxide (100 mM) in 10 mL of water, and incubated for 24 hours at 80Â°C. Untreated<br>
reactions received no hydrogen peroxide. At the end of the incubation, the pH was<br>
adjusted by addition of 100 mM NaOAc buffer (pH 5.0), 25 mg of Trichoderma<br>
reesei cellulase was added, and the solution was incubated for 24 hours at 65Â°C.<br>
Untreated reactions received no cellulase. The reducing sugar content of the<br>
hydrolyzate was determined by DNS assay. The results of these experiments are<br>
shown in Table 9. These results show that the treatment is capable of releasing sugars<br>
from many lignocellulosic materials.<br><br><br>
Example 6. Production of Fermentable Materials from Corn Stover<br>
Corn stover (2.0 g) was mixed with hydrogen peroxide (0.1%) in 10 mL of<br>
water. After 24 hours of incubation at 80Â°C, the pH was adjusted to 5.0 and 50 mg of<br>
cellulase from Trichoderma reesei was added and incubated for 24 hours at 65Â°C.<br>
The reducing sugar content of the hydrolyzate was then determined by DNS assay.<br>
Next, the hydrolyzate was adjusted to pH 7.0, filter-sterilized, and added to a carbon-<br>
free minimal growth media (M63) (Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, 2001) to<br>
produce a final sugar concentration of 5%. Control growth media was prepared by<br>
adding 5% glucose to media without sugar. Bacterial cells (Escherichia coli) were<br>
added to each medium, incubated with shaking at 37Â°C, and the growth was<br>
monitored through 48 hours by measuring the absorbance of each medium at 600 nm.<br>
The 48-hour timepoint for these data are shown in Table 10. Hydrolyzates of the<br>
method caused high levels of E. coli. growth. The results indicate that hydrolyzates<br>
from the method allow greater microbial growth than glucose. The hydrolyzates were<br>
not toxic to E. coli, even as undiluted hydrolyzates.<br><br>
Example 7. Hydrolvzates are Fermentable Materials That Enhance Microbial Growth<br>
The hydrolyzate produced by hydrogen peroxide treatment and cellulase<br>
treatment (described in Example 6) was diluted into carbon-free minimal growth<br>
media (M63) to produce a final sugar concentration ranging from 0.0 % to 1.0 %.<br>
Control growth media were prepared with the same final sugar concentration of<br>
glucose and xylose (ratio of 63:37). Bacterial cells {Escherichia coli XL1 MRF')<br>
were added to each medium, incubated with shaking at 37Â°C, and the growth was<br>
quantified at 48 hours by absorbance at 600 nm. Microbial growth was greater in the<br>
hydrolyzate media than in control media prepared with glucose and xylose (see Figure<br>
4).<br><br>
Example 8. Detergent Treatment Increases Hvdrolvsis of Corn Stover bv Hydrogen<br>
Peroxide Treatment Followed bv Cellulase Treatment<br>
Corn stover (2.0 g) was mixed with hydrogen peroxide (1%) in 10 mL of<br>
water. After 24 hours of incubation at 80Â°C, the pH was adjusted to 5.0. To this was<br>
added 50 mg of cellulase from Trichoderma reesei as well as Triton X-100 (2%, v/v).<br>
Separately, corn stover (2.0 g) was mixed with hydrogen peroxide (1%) in 10 mL of<br>
water, incubated for 24 hours at 80Â°C, and adjusted to pH 5.0. To this was added 50<br>
mg of cellulase from Trichoderma reesei as well as Tween-20 (3%, v/v). Controls<br>
without detergent (cellulase only) were included in both experiments. Reactions were<br>
incubated for 96 hours at 40Â°C. The reducing sugar content was determined using the<br>
DNS assay. Results of this analysis show that both Tween-20 and Triton X-100<br>
stimulate sugar release from corn stover. These data are summarized in Table 11.<br><br>
Example 9. Oxidizing Agents Sterilize Lignocellulosic Materials<br>
Corn stover (1 g) was suspended in 10 mL sterile water, and either autoclaved,<br>
or non-autoclaved. As expected, autoclaving killed essentially all microbes, resulting<br>
in less than 100 colony forming units per ml. In contrast, unautoclaved stover<br>
contained -20,000 colony forming units per mL. Unautoclaved samples were treated<br>
with 0.1% hydrogen peroxide at 50Â°C for 24 hours. Serial dilutions were performed as<br>
known in the art and plated on nutrient broth plates. Plates were incubated at 30Â°C<br>
for 24 hours, then colony forming units counted. Hydrogen peroxide treatment was<br>
found to reduce microbial content substantially compared to the untreated control<br>
(Table 12).<br><br><br>
Hydrolysis<br>
Com stover (0.2 g) was suspended in 9 mL of distilled water (pH 5.2) and 1<br>
mL of sodium hypochlorite solution (10-13% available chlorine, Sigma). This<br>
pretreatment was carried out in a shaker-incubator at 80Â°C at 300 rpm for 24 hours.<br>
Following pretreatment, thepH was adjusted to 5.2-5.4, and Spezyme CP (0.3<br>
mL)(Genencor) was added to the samples followed by incubation at 40Â°C, 300 rpm<br>
for 24 hours. Supernatant aliquots were collected after 24 hours and the reducing<br>
sugar content was determined by DNS assay Pw=540 nm). All samples were run in<br>
duplicate. Sodium hypochlorite treatment produced significant hydrolysis of corn<br>
stover (Table 13). Treatment with 10% sodium hypochlorite and Spezyme resulted in<br>
greater hydrolysis of stover compared to treatment with Spezyme alone.<br><br>
Further quantification of sugars was performed by HPLC. HPLC<br>
chromatogram analysis of the treated material identifies the sugars produced<br>
following stover pretreatment using 10% NaOCl (24 hrs) followed by 0.3 mL of<br>
Spezyme (24 hrs). The sample was diluted by 1:50 prior to injection. A peak<br>
containing glucose, arabinose, galactose and mannose (6.3 minutes) was separated<br>
from a peak containing xylose (6.8 minutes). The percentage of available sugars<br>
solubilized was calculated by integration of each peak area (Table 14). Thus,<br>
treatment with sodium hypochlorite results in release of a high percentage of sugars<br>
from lignocellulose.<br><br><br>
Example 11. Significant Hydrolysis of Com Stover is Obtained With Much Lower<br>
Concentrations of Cellnlase<br>
Stover samples pretreated with NaOCl were reacted with either 0.3 mL<br>
Spezyme or 0.03 mL Spezyme. Samples with 0.3 mL Spezyme produced 84%<br>
hydrolysis of total sugars, while samples with 0.03 mL Spezyme produced 79%<br>
hydrolysis. A control sample with no NaOCl and 0.3 mL Spezyme produced 42%<br>
hydrolysis (see Table 15).<br>
This experiment shows that pretreatment with a 10% solution of the NaOCl stock,<br>
followed by reaction with a cellulase (in this case Spezyme) produces significant<br>
hydrolysis of lignocellulose to sugar.<br><br>

Example 22. Recycled Sodium Percarbonate Increases Corn Stover Hydrolysis<br>
Corn stover (20 g in final reaction of 200 mL) was contacted with sodium<br>
percarbonate (5.0% final concentration) at 80Â°C for 24 hours. The supernatant was<br>
removed and tested for the presence of sugars by DNS assay. The sugar<br>
concentration was less than 1%. This supernatant (10 mL) was contacted with fresh<br>
corn stover (0.2 g in final reaction of 10 mL) at 80Â°C for 24 hours. In a separate<br>
reaction, freshly prepared sodium percarbonate (5.0 % final concentration) was<br>

Spezyme alone (Table 26).<br><br><br>
Example 23. Multiple Treatments Release Additional Sugar from Lignocellulose<br>
Lignocellulose (com stover, 0.2 g in final reaction of 10 mL) was contacted<br>
with 0.2% hydrogen peroxide at 80Â°C for 24 hours. The pH was adjusted to pH 5.2,<br>
and 0.3 ml of Spezyme CP (Genencor) was added, and the reaction was incubated at<br>
40Â°C for 72 hours. Sugar release was measured by DNS assay, and each sample was<br>
then rinsed to remove soluble sugars. Next, hydrogen peroxide (0.2%), urea hydrogen<br>
peroxide (5%), sodium hypochlorite (1% available chlorine), calcium hypochlorite<br>
(1% available chlorine), or NMMO (75%) were added to individual samples, and<br>
incubated at 80Â°C for 24 hours. Controls without chemical were also prepared.<br>
Following dilution of the chemical (NMMO) or simple pH adjustment to pH 5.2<br>
(hydrogen peroxide, sodium hypochlorite, calcium hypochlorite, urea hydrogen<br>
peroxide, no chemical), 0.3 mL of Spezyme was added, and the reaction incubated at<br>
40Â°C for 72 hours. The second Spezyme treatment was found to increase sugar<br>
release when a second chemical treatment preceded it (Table 27).<br><br><br>
Example 24. Hydrogen Peroxide Treatment Generates Lignocellulose and<br>
Hvdrolvzates mat Support Lactic Acid Production<br>
Lignocellulose (com stover) was contacted with 0.2% hydrogen peroxide at<br>
80Â°C for 24 hours. The pH was adjusted to pH 5.2, and 0.3 ml of Spezyme CP<br>
(Genencor) was added, and the reaction was incubated at 40Â°C for 72 hours. The<br>
residual solids were separated from the hydrolyzate, washed, suspended in water, and<br>
0.01 g of a commercially available silage inoculant known to contain lactic acid-<br>
producing bacteria (Biotal Silage II Inoculant, Biotal Inc.) was added. Fermentation<br>
was carried out for 24 hours at 37Â°C, and microbial growth was confirmed<br>
microscopically. Similarly, the hydrolyzate generated following each treatment was<br>
adjusted to pH 7.0, filter-sterilized, mixed with a minimal salts medium lacking<br>
carbon (Enriched Minimal Media (EMM) EMM contains Solution A (In 900 mls: 2 g<br>

B (In 100 mis: 0.21 g Na2HPO4,0.09 g NaH2PO4, pH 7.0), and inoculated with a<br><br>
Biotal inoculant seed culture that was grown in MRS broth to AÂ«o = 0.5, washed<br>
twice, and diluted 1:1000. After incubation, fermentation liquid from both<br>
fermentations (stover residual solids and stover hydrolyzates) were assayed for<br>
production of NADH (340 nm) following enzymatic conversion of lactic acid to<br>
produce pyruvate (Diffchamb) (Table 28). Therefore, both the com stover residual<br>
solids and the hydrolyzate produced are capable of supporting growth of lactic acid<br>
bacteria, and of supporting lactic acid production.<br><br>
Example 25. Hydrogen Peroxide Treatment of Corn Fiber Generates Hvdrolvzates<br>
and Residual Solids that Support Lactic Acid Production<br>
Lignocellulose (com fiber) was contacted with 0.2% hydrogen peroxide at<br>
80Â°C for 24 hours. The pH was adjusted to pH 5.2,0.3 ml of Spezyme CP (Genencor)<br>
was added, and the reaction was incubated at 40Â°C for 48 hours. The residual solids<br>
(0.2 g) were separated from the hydrolyzate, washed, suspended in water, and 0.01 g<br>
of a commercially available silage inoculant known to contain lactic acid-producing<br>
bacteria (Biotal Silage II Inoculant, Biotal Inc.) was added. Fermentation was carried<br>
out for 24 hours at 37Â°C, and microbial growth was confirmed microscopically. The<br>
hydrolyzate generated following treatment were adjusted to pH 7.0, filter-sterilized,<br>
mixed with a minimal salts medium lacking carbon (EMM), and also inoculated with<br>
a Biotal inoculant seed culture that was grown in MRS broth to A#)o - 0.5, washed,<br>
and diluted 1:1000. These fermentations were carried out for 64 hours at 37Â°C. After<br>
incubation, fermentation liquid from both fermentations (stover residual solids and<br>
stover hydrolyzate) were assayed for production of NADH (340 nm) following<br>
enzymatic conversion of lactic acid to produce pyruvate (Diffchamb) (Table 29).<br><br>
Therefore, both the corn fiber residual solids and the hydrolyzate produced are<br>
capable of supporting growth of lactic acid bacteria, and are capable of supporting<br>
lactic acid production.<br><br>
Example 26. Treatment with Oxidizing Agents Generates Hvdrorvzates that Support<br>
Lactic Acid Production<br>
Com stover was treated with hydrogen peroxide (0.2%) for 24 hours at 80Â°C,<br>
adjusted to pH 5.2, and treated with 0.3 mL Spezyme for 144 hours at 40Â°C. The<br>
stover was then rinsed, sterilized and 1 gram was contacted with urea hydrogen<br>
peroxide (5%) at 80Â°C for 24 hours. Following pH adjustment to pH 5.2,0.3 mL of<br>
Spezyme was added for 48 hours at 40Â°C. Similarly, 1.5 g of fresh corn stover was<br>
contacted with sodium hypochlorite (1% available chlorine) for 24 hours at 80Â°C,<br>
adjusted to pH 5.2, and then 0.3 mL of Spezyme CP was added for 48 hours at 40Â°C.<br>
Both hydrolyzates were then adjusted to pH 7.0, filter sterilized, and mixed with a<br>
minimal salts medium lacking carbon (EMM) at 0.2% total sugars concentration. A<br>
seed culture in MRS broth (Difco) containing a mixed lactic acid inoculant<br>
preparation (Biotal Silage Inoculant IL Biotal Inc.) was grown to Aeoo = 0.5, washed<br>
twice, diluted 1:1000, added to each medium and incubated for 64 hours at 37Â°C.<br>
After incubation, fermentation liquid from both fermentations (urea hydrogen<br>
peroxide treated, sodium hypochlorite treated) were assayed for production of NADH<br>
(340 nm) following enzymatic conversion of lactic acid to produce pyruvate<br>
(Diffchamb) (Table 30). Therefore, hydrolyzates resulting from treatment of<br>
lignocellulosic materials with oxidizing agents can be used by lactic acid-producing<br>
bacteria and can be used to produce lactic acid.<br><br><br>
Several corn stover hydrolyzates were prepared using chemical treatments in<br>
reaction volumes of 10 mL:<br>
Spezyme only:<br>
1.5 g com stover was treated with 0.3 mL Spezyme CP (Genencor) for 48<br>
hours, 40Â°C, at pH 5.2.<br>
Hydrogen peroxide:<br>
1.5 g com stover was treated with 0.2% hydrogen peroxide (80Â°C, 24 hours),<br>
adjusted to pH 5.2, and then treated with 0.3 mL Spezyme CP (40Â°C, 48<br>
hours).<br>
Sodium hypochlorite:<br>
1.5 g com stover was treated with sodium hypochlorite (1% available<br>
chlorine)(80Â°C, 24 hours), adjusted to pH 5.2, and then treated with 0.3 mL<br>
Spezyme CP (40Â°C, 48 hours).<br>
Sodium hypochlorite, diluted:<br>
1.5 g com stover was treated with sodium hypochlorite (1% available<br>
chlorineX80Â°C, 24 hours), washed to dilute the chemical, adjusted to pH 5.2,<br>
and then treated with 0.3 mL Spezyme CP (40Â°C, 48 hours).<br>
Urea hydrogen peroxide:<br>
1.5 g com stover was treated with 0.2% hydrogen peroxide (SOX, 24 hours),<br>
adjusted to pH 5.2, and then treated with 0.3 mL Spezyme CP (40Â°C, 48<br>
hours). The material was then treated with 10% urea hydrogen peroxide<br><br>
(80Â°C, 24 hours), adjusted to pH 5.2, and then treated with 0.3 mL Spezyme<br>
CP(40Â°C, 48 hours).<br>
Sodium percarbonate:<br>
0.2 g com stover was treated with 2.5% sodium percarbonate (80Â°C, 24<br>
hours), adjusted to pH 5.2, and then treated with 0.3 mL Spezyme CP (40Â°C,<br>
48 hours).<br>
Potassium Persulfate:<br>
0.2 g corn stover was treated with 1.0% potassium persulfate (80Â°C, 24 hours),<br>
adjusted to pH 5.2, and then treated with 0.3 mL Spezyme CP (40Â°C, 48<br>
hours).<br>
Nitric Acid:<br>
0.2 g corn stover was treated with 1.0% nitric acid (80Â°C, 24 hours), adjusted<br>
to pH 5.2, and then treated with 0.3 mL Spezyme CP (40Â°C, 48 hours).<br>
Additionally, corn fiber hydrolyzate was prepared using hydrogen peroxide: 2<br>
g corn fiber was treated with 0.2% hydrogen peroxide (80Â°C, 24 hours), adjusted to<br>
pH 5.2, and then treated with 0.3 mL Spezyme CP (40Â°C, 48 hours).<br>
Following Spezyme treatment, each hydrolyzate was adjusted to pH 7.0, filter<br>
sterilized, and then added to a minimal salts medium lacking carbon (EMM) at a final<br>
sugars concentration of 0.2%. A negative control medium without sugars was also<br>
prepared. Each hydrolyzate was inoculated with a representative bacterial strain<br>
(ATX 3661) and incubated for 14 hours (no sugars, sodium hypochlorite diluted, urea<br>
hydrogen peroxide, sodium percarbonate, potassium persulfate, hydrogen peroxide) or<br>
40 hours (hydrogen peroxide) or 48 hours (Spezyme only, sodium hypochlorite) at<br>
37Â°C. Growth from each culture was assessed by absorbance at 600 run (Table 31).<br>
Control cultures without sugars in each experiment yielded an absorbance (600 nm)<br>
lower than 0.005.<br>
Therefore, hydrolyzates resulting from treatment of lignocellulosic material<br>
with various chemicals support microbial growth.<br><br><br>
Example 28. Com Stover Hvdrolvzates Provide Components for Microbial Growth<br>
ATX3661 is a Bacillus strain that will not grow in minimal media (EMM)<br>
when supplemented with glucose, or with glucose/xylose mixtures. Thus, ATX3661<br>
requires additional nutrients other that glucose and xylose for growth in this media.<br>
Lignocellulose (corn stover) was contacted with hydrogen peroxide (0.2%) or<br>
sodium hypochlorite (1% available chlorine) and incubated at 80Â°C for 24 hours. The<br>
pH was adjusted to pH 5.2,0.3 ml of Spezyme CP (Genencor) was added, and the<br>
reaction was incubated at 40Â°C for 144 hours (sodium hypochlorite) or 48 hours<br>
(hydrogen peroxide). Corn stover samples without chemical treatment were included,<br>
and treated with Spezyme for 24 hours at 40Â°C. The hydrolyzates generated<br>
following Spezyme treatment were adjusted to pH 7.0, filter-sterilized, and mixed<br>
with a minimal salts medium lacking carbon (EMM) at a total sugar concentration of<br>
0.20% (hydrogen peroxide) or 0.15% (sodium hypochlorite, Spezyme only). Control<br>
media was prepared in which glucose (0.095%) and xylose (0.055%) were added in<br>
place of the hydrolyzates ("Glucose/Xylose"), or hydrolyzate was omitted ("No<br>
Sugars"). Next, each media was inoculated with a representative bacterial strain<br>
(ATX 3661), incubated for 48 hours (sodium hypochlorite, Spezyme only, No Sugars,<br>
Glucose/Xylose) or 40 hours (hydrogen peroxide) at 37Â°C. Growth from each culture<br>
was detected by absorbance at 600 nm (Table 32). As expected, ATX3661 did not<br>
grow in EMM supplemented with Glucose and xylose. Surprisingly, ATX3661 did<br><br>
show growth when supplemented with hydrolyzates. Therefore, hydrolyzates supports<br>
microbial growth of strains that pure sugar does not.<br><br>
Example 29. Hydrogen Peroxide Treatment and Sodium Percarbonate Treatment<br>

Multipurpose copy paper (0.2 g, Quill, #7-20222) was shredded (average<br>
particle size = 5 mm) and contacted with hydrogen peroxide (0.3% final<br>
concentration) or sodium percarbonate (1.0% final concentration) in a volume of 10<br>
mL at 80Â°C for 24 hours. The pH was adjusted to pH 5.2,0.3 ml of Spezyme CP<br>
(Genencor) was added, and the reaction was incubated at 40Â°C for 96 hours. Sugar<br>
release was measured by DNS assay. Treatment with hydrogen peroxide was found<br>
to increase sugar release beyond treatment with Spezyme alone (Table 33).<br><br>
Example 30. Sodium Percarbonate and Potassium Superoxide Solubilize Corn Stover<br>
Proteins During Pretreatment<br>
Lignocellulose (corn stover, 0.2 g in final reaction of 10 mL) was contacted<br>
with sodium percarbonate (1.0% final concentration) or potassium superoxide (0.5%<br>
final concentration) at 80Â°C for 24 hours. The pH was adjusted to pH 5.2, and the<br><br>
supernatants tested for the presence of soluble protein (Bio-Rad Protein Assay).<br>
Bovine serum albumin (BSA) was used to generate a standard curve for quantitation.<br>
Treatment with sodium percarbonate or potassium superoxide was found to solubilize<br>
proteins from corn stover (Table 34).<br><br>
Example 31. Sodium Hvpochlorite Treatment at pH 5 Increases Corn Stover<br>
Hydrolysis<br>
Lignocellulose (corn stover, 0.2 g in final reaction of 10 mL) was contacted<br>
with sodium hypochlorite (1% available chlorine, final concentration) at 80Â°C for 24<br>
hours. The pH was held constant by buffering with 200 mM sodium acetate buffer,<br>
pH 5, and a buffer-only negative control was also treated. 0.03 mL of Spezyme CP<br>
(Genencor) was added, and the reaction incubated at 40Â°C for 96 hours. Sugar release<br>
was measured by DNS assay. Sodium hypochlorite treatment at pH 5 was found to<br>
increase sugar release beyond treatment with Spezyme alone (Table 35).<br><br><br>
Example 32. Peroxvacetic Acid Treatment Increases Corn Stover Hydrolysis in the<br>
Presence of Acetic Acid and Sulfuric Acid<br>
Lignocellulose (corn stover, 0.2 g in final reaction of 10 mL) was contacted<br>
with peroxyacetic acid (Sigma Chemical, 2.0% final concentration). Since this reagent<br>
contains acetic acid and sulfuric acid as well, a mixture of acetic acid (2.6% final<br>
concentration) and sulfuric acid (0.06% final concentration) was used as a control.<br>
Reactions were incubated at 80Â°C for 24 hours. Then, 0.03 mL of Spezyme CP<br>
(Genencor) was added to both reactions and they were incubated at 40Â°C for 24 hours.<br>
Sugar release was measured by DNS assay. Peroxyacetic acid was found to liberate<br>
sugar from stover (Table 36).<br><br>
Example 33. Sodium Percarbonate. Sodium Hypochlorite and Peroxvacetic Acid<br>
Pretreattnents Allow Hydrolysis with Low Enzyme Loads<br>
Lignocellulose (com stover, 0.2 g in final reaction of 10 mL) was contacted<br>
with sodium percarbonate (1.0% final concentration) or sodium hypochlorite (1% free<br>
chlorine, final concentration) or peroxyacetic acid (2.0% final concentration) at 80Â°C<br>
for 24 hours. 0.03 mL or 0.012 mL or 0.006 mL of Spezyme CP (Genencor) was<br>
added, and the reaction was incubated at 40Â°C for 120 hours. Sugar release was<br>
measured by DNS assay. Pretreatment with sodium percarbonate, sodium<br>
hypochlorite, or peroxyacetic acid allowed low enzyme concentrations to be used<br>
(Table 37).<br><br><br>

the amount of enzyme used in such processes, (3) the ability to produce and use a<br>
concentrated sugar solution, (4) the ability to directly use the treated product for<br>
fermentation without the need for further processing, as no toxic products are formed.<br>
These advantages also lead to economic benefits.<br>
