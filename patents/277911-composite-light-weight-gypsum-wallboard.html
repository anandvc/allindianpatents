				<td>COMPOSITE LIGHT WEIGHT GYPSUM WALLBOARD<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001] This invention pertains to unique light weight composite gypsum boards<br>
having high strength. It also pertains to a method of making such light weight<br>
composite gypsum boards using a unique gypsum-containing slurry to form a<br>
foamed low density set gypsum core and non-foamed (or reduced-foamed) bonding<br>
high density layers that bond the top and bottom cover sheets to the core.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] Certain properties of gypsum (calcium sulfate dihydrate) make it very<br>
popular for use in making industrial and building products, such as gypsum<br>
wallboard. Gypsum is a plentiful and generally inexpensive raw material which,<br>
through a process of dehydration and rehydration, can be cast, molded or<br>
otherwise formed into useful shapes. The base material from which gypsum<br>
wallboard and other gypsum products are manufactured is the hemihydrate form of<br>
calcium sulfate (CaSO4-1/2H2O). commonly termed "stucco." which is produced by<br>
heat conversion of the dihydrate form of calcium sulfate (CaSO4-2H2O). from which<br>
1-1/2 water molecules been removed.<br>
[0003] Conventional gypsum-containing products such as gypsum wallboard<br>
have many advantages, such as low cost and easy workability. Various<br>
improvements have been achieved in making gypsum-containing products using<br>
starches as ingredients in the slurries used to make such products. Pregelatinized<br>
starch, for example, can increase flexural strength and compressive strength of<br>
gypsum-containing products including gypsum wallboard. Known gypsum<br>
wallboard contains board starch at levels of less than about 10 Ibs/MSF.<br>
[0004] It is also necessary to use substantial amounts of water in gypsum<br>
slunries containing pregelatinized starch in order to ensure proper flowability of the<br>
slurry. Unfortunately, most of this water must eventually be driven off by drying,<br>
which is expensive due to the high cost of the fuels used in the drying process.<br>
The drying step is also time-consuming. It has been found that the use of<br>
naphthalenesulfonate dispersants can increase the fluidity of the slurries, thus<br>
 <br>
overcoming the water demand problem. In addition, it has also been found that the<br>
naphthalenesulfonate dispersants, if the usage level is high enough, can cross-link<br>
to the pregelatinized starch to bind the gypsum crystals together after drying, thus<br>
increasing dry strength of the gypsum composite. Trimetaphosphate salts have not<br>
In the past been recognized to affect gypsum slurry water requirements. However,<br>
the present inventors have discovered that increasing the level of the<br>
trimetaphosphate salt to hitherto unknown levels in the presence of a specific<br>
dispersant makes it possible to achieve proper slurry flowability with unexpectedly<br>
reduced amounts of water, even in the presence of high starch levels. This, of<br>
course, is highly desirable because it in turn reduces fuel usage for drying as well<br>
as the process time associated with subsequent water removal process steps.<br>
Thus the present inventors have also discovered that the dry strength of gypsum<br>
board can be increased by using a naphthalenesulfonate dispersant in combination<br>
with pregelatinized starch in the slurry used to make the wallboard.<br>
[0005] Conventional gypsum wallboards have adequate strength for working,<br>
and meet standard test requirements such as nail pull (77 ib) and core hardness<br>
(11 Ib). However, conventional wallboards are heavy, typically weighing up to<br>
1600-1700 Ib/MSF. If a way could be found to produce a high strength gypsum<br>
wallboard in which board weight (and density) Is significantly reduced, without<br>
adversely affecting nail pull and hardness characteristics, this would represent a<br>
useful contribution to the art.<br>
[0006] It Is also known in making gypsum wallboard that bonding layers can be<br>
used to promote adherence or bonding of the paper cover sheets to the set gypsum<br>
core. Typically, these bonding layers are relatively thick, ranging from about 7 mils<br>
to about 25 mils, even up to 50 mils. Thinner bonding layers would be expected to<br>
be more difficult to apply and to present other drawbacks. Unfortunately, the use of<br>
these thick bonding layers can decrease the core hardness in the finished<br>
wallboard. Finished densities in these dried bonding layers range from greater than<br>
about 70 pcf to about 90 pcf. The term "pcf is defined as pounds per cubic foot<br>
(Ib/ft3). If a way could be found to make a low density set gypsum board using<br>
thinner, lighter bonding layers, without sacrificing core hardness or other important<br>
board properties, this would represent a useful contribution to the art.<br>
 <br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[00071 The invention generally comprises a light weight gypsum composite<br>
board including a foamed low density set gypsum core having a top surface and a<br>
bottom surface, the foamed low density set gypsum core made using a gypsum-<br>
containing slurry comprising stucco, and based on the weight of stucco,<br>
pregelatinized starch in an amount of about 0.5 - 10% by weight, a<br>
naphthalenesuifonate dispersant in an amount of about 0.1 - 3.0% by weight and<br>
sodium trimetaphosphate in an amount of about 0.12 - 0.4% by weight, the light<br>
weight gypsum composite board also including a top non-foamed (or reduced-<br>
foamed) bonding high density layer covering the top surface of the foamed low<br>
density set gypsum core, a bottom non-foamed (or reduced-foamed) bonding high<br>
density layer covering the bottom surface of the foamed low density set gypsum<br>
core, a top cover sheet, and a bottom cover sheet, wherein the top cover sheet is<br>
bonded to the foamed low density set gypsum core by the top non-foamed (or<br>
reduced-foamed) bonding high density layer, and the bottom cover sheet is bonded<br>
to the foamed low density set gypsum core by the bottom non-foamed (or reduced-<br>
foamed) bonding high density layer.<br>
{0008] The top and bottom non-foamed (or reduced-foamed) bonding high<br>
density layers of the light weight gypsum composite board comprise from about<br>
10% by weight to about 16% by weight of the total amount of the gypsum-<br>
containing slurry. In a preferred embodiment, the top non-foamed (or reduced-<br>
foamed) bonding high density layer covering the top surface of the foamed low<br>
density set gypsum core comprises about 6% - 9% by weight of the total amount of<br>
the gypsum-containing slurry, and the bottom non-foamed (or reduced-foamed)<br>
bonding high density layer covering the bottom surface of the foamed low density<br>
set gypsum core comprising about 4% - 6% by weight of the total amount of the<br>
gypsum-containing slurry.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0009] It has now unexpectedly been found that the preparation of a foamed low<br>
density set gypsum core using thinner, lighter top and bottom non-foamed (or<br>
reduced-foamed) bonding high density layers to attain good bonding of a heavy top<br>
 <br>
(face) cover sheet and a bottom (back) cover sheet, can provide a composite<br>
gypsum board having nail pull resistance, core hardness, and board strength.<br>
[0010] The composite gypsum board of the present invention includes a foamed<br>
low density set gypsum core having a top surface and a bottom surface, a top non-<br>
foamed (or reduced-foamed) bonding high density layer covering the top surface of<br>
the foamed low density set gypsum core, a top (or face) cover sheet having a<br>
foamed low density set gypsum core-facing surface, the top cover sheet bonded to<br>
the foamed low density set gypsum core by the top non-foamed (or reduced-<br>
foamed) bonding high density layer, a bottom non-foamed (or reduced-foamed)<br>
bonding high density layer covering the bottom surfece of the foamed low density<br>
set gypsum core, and a bottom (or back) cover sheet having a foamed low density<br>
set gypsum core-facing surface, the bottom cover sheet bonded to the foamed low<br>
density set gypsum core by the bottom non-foamed (or reduced-foamed) bonding<br>
high density layer. Preferably the top cover sheet will be paper having a weight of<br>
about 60 Ib/MSF (thickness about 18 mils). Additionally, the top (face) cover sheet<br>
and bottom (back) cover sheet are substantially parallel with respect to the foamed<br>
low density set gypsum core. The foamed low density set gypsum core is made<br>
from a foamed gypsum slurry containing stucco, and includes pregelatinized starch,<br>
and preferably a naphthalenesulfonate dispersant, and also preferably, sodium<br>
trimetaphosphate. The top and bottom non-foamed (or reduced-foamed) bonding<br>
high density layers can comprise from about 10% to about 16% of the of the total<br>
amount of gypsum slurry.<br>
10011] According to one embodiment of the present invention, there are<br>
provided finished composite gypsum board from gypsum-containing slurries<br>
containing stucco, pregelatinized starch, a naphthalenesulfonate dispersant, and<br>
sodium trimetaphosphate. The naphthalenesulfonate dispersant is present in an<br>
amount of about 0.1 % - 3.0% by weight based on the weight of dry stucco. The<br>
pregelatinized starch is present in an amount of at least about 0.5% by weight up to<br>
about 10% by weight based on the weight of dry stucco in the formulation. The<br>
sodium trimetaphosphate is present in an amount of about 0.12% - 0.4% by weight<br>
based on the weight of dry stucco in the formulation. Other ingredients that may be<br>
used in the slurry include binders, paper fiber, glass fiber, and accelerators. A soap<br>
 <br>
foam which introduces air voids is added to the newiy formuiated gypsum-<br>
containing slumes to help reduce the density of the foamed low density set gypsum<br>
core in the final gypsum-containing product, for example, gypsum wallboard or<br>
composite gypsum board.<br>
[0012] The combination of from about 0.5% by weight up to about 10% by<br>
weight pregelatinized starch, from about 0.1% by weight up to about 3.0% by<br>
weight naphthalenesulfonate dispersant, and a minimum of at least about 0.12% by<br>
weight up to about 0.4% by weight of trimetaphosphate salt (all based on the<br>
weight of dry stucco used in the gypsum slurry) unexpectedly and significantly<br>
increases the fluidity of the gypsum slurry. This substantially reduces the amount<br>
of water required to produce a gypsum slurry with sufficient flowability to be used in<br>
making gypsum-containing products such as gypsum wallboard. The level of<br>
trimetaphosphate salt, which is at least about twice that of standard formulations<br>
(as sodium trimetaphosphate), is believed to boost the dispersant activity of the<br>
naphthalenesulfonate dispersant.<br>
[0013] The air voids can reduce the bonding strength between a foamed low<br>
density set gypsum core and the cover sheets. Since greater than half of the<br>
composite gypsum boards by volume may consist of air voids due to foam, the foam<br>
can interfere with the bond between the foamed low density set gypsum core and the<br>
paper cover sheets. This is addressed by providing a non-foamed (or reduced-<br>
foamed) bonding high density layer on the gypsum core-contacting surfaces of both<br>
the top cover sheet and the bottom cover sheet prior to applying the cover sheets to<br>
the core. This non-foamed, or alternatively, reduced-foamed, bonding high density<br>
layer formulation typically will be the same as that of the gypsum slurry core<br>
formulation, except that either no soap will be added, or a substantially reduced<br>
amount of soap (foam) will be added. Optionally, in order to form this bonding layer,<br>
foam can be mechanically removed from the core formulation, or a different foam-free<br>
formulation can be applied at the foamed low density set gypsum core/ face paper<br>
interface.<br>
[0014] Soap foam is required to introduce and to control the air (bubble) void<br>
sizes and distribution in the foamed set gypsum core, and to control the density of<br>
 <br>
the foamed set gypsum core. A preferred range of soap in the set gypsum core is<br>
from about 0.2 Ib/MSF to about 0.7 Ib/MSF; a more preferred level of soap is about<br>
0.3 Ib/MSF to about 0.5 Ib/MSF. Although preferably no soap will be used in the<br>
non-foamed bonding high density layers, if soap is used jn reduced-foamed<br>
bonding high density layers, the amount will be about 5% by weight or less of the<br>
amount of soap used to make the foamed low density set gypsum core.<br>
[0015] The non-foamed or reduced-foamed, that is. high density portion of the<br>
gypsum-containing slurry used in the bonding layer will be from about 10 - 16% by<br>
weight of the (wet) slurry used in making the final board. In a preferred<br>
embodiment, 6 - 9% by weight of the slurry can be used as the top non-foamed (or<br>
reduced-foamed) bonding high density layer, and 4 - 7% by weight of the slurry<br>
can be used as the bottom non-foamed (or reduced-foamed) bonding high density<br>
layer. The presence of the top and bottom non-foamed (or reduced-foamed)<br>
bonding high density layers provides an Improved bond between the top and<br>
bottom cover sheets and the foamed low density set gypsum core. The wet density<br>
of the non-foamed bonding high density layer can be about 80-85 pcf. The dry<br>
(finished) density of the non-foamed (or reduced-foamed) bonding high density<br>
layer can be about 45-70 pcf. Additionally, the thickness of the non-foamed (or<br>
reduced-foamed) bonding high density layers of the present invention will range<br>
from about 2 mils to less than 7 mils.<br>
(00161 Preferred cover sheets may be made of paper as in conventional gypsum<br>
wallboard, although other useful cover sheet materials known in the art (e.g. fibrous<br>
glass mates) may be used. However, particular heavy paper cover sheets preferably<br>
will be used as top (face) cover sheets in the embodiments of the present invention.<br>
Useful cover sheet paper include Manila 7-ply and News-Line 5-ply, available from<br>
United States Gypsum Corporation, Chicago, Illinois; and Grey-Back 3-ply and Manila<br>
Ivory 3-ply, available firom Caraustar, Newport, Indiana. A preferred bottom cover<br>
sheet paper is 5-ply News-Line {e.g. 42-46 Ib/MSF). A preferred top cover sheet<br>
paper is Manila 7-ply. A particularly preferred top cover sheet paper is heavy Manila<br>
paper (60 Ib/MSF, thickness 18 mils), available from Caraustar, Newport, Indiana.<br>
Other heavy, thick paper will also be preferred, ranging in thickness from about 15<br>
-20 mils.<br>
 <br>
[0017] Fibrous mats may also be used as one or both of the cover sheets.<br>
Preferably the fibrous mats will be nonwoven glass fiber mats In which filaments of<br>
glass fiber are bonded together by an adhesive. Most preferably, the nonwoven glass<br>
fiber mats will have a heavy resin coating. For example, Ouraglass nonwoven glass<br>
fiber mats, available from Johns-Manville, having a weight of about 1.5 lb/100 ft2, with<br>
about 40-50% of the mat weight coming from the resin coating, could be used.<br>
[0018] It is noted here that in manufacturing of conventional gypsum wallboard,<br>
the top or face paper is laid down and moves along the production line first, and so<br>
constitutes what is known in the art as the "bottom" of the process, despite<br>
contacting and forming the top or face of the wallboard product. Conversely, the<br>
bottom or back paper is applied last in the manufacturing process in what is known<br>
as the "top" of the process. These same conventions will apply in the formation and<br>
preparation of the composite gypsum boards of the present invention. Reference is<br>
made to Example 7B below.<br>
[0019] It is preferred that a naphthalenesulfonate dispersant be used in gypsum-<br>
containing slurries prepared in accordance with the present invention. The<br>
naphthalenesulfonate dispersants used in the present invention include<br>
polynaphthalenesuifonic acid and its salts (polynaphthalenesulfonates) and<br>
derivatives, which are condensation products of naphthalenesulfonic acids and<br>
formaldehyde. Particularly desirable polynaphthalenesulfonates include sodium<br>
and calcium naphthalenesulfonate. The average molecular weight of the<br>
naphthalenesulfonates can range from about 3,000 to 27,000, although it is<br>
preferred that the molecular weight be about 8,000 to 22.000, and more preferred<br>
that the molecular weight be about 12,000 to 17.000. As a commercial product, a<br>
higher molecular weight dispersant has higher viscosity, and lower solids content,<br>
than a lower molecular weight dispersant. Useful naphthalenesulfonates include<br>
DILOFLO, available from GEO Specialty Chemicals, Cleveland, Ohio; DAXAD,<br>
available from Hampshire Chemical Corp., Lexington, Massachusetts; and LOMAR<br>
D. available from GEO Specialty Chemicals. Lafayette, Indiana. The<br>
naphthalenesulfonates are preferably used as aqueous solutions In the range 35-<br>
55% by weight solids content, for example. It is most preferred to use the<br>
naphthalenesulfonates in the form of an aqueous solution, for example, in the<br>
 <br>
range of about 40-45% by weight solids content. Alternatively, where appropriate,<br>
the naphthalenesulfonates can be used in dry solid or powder form, such as<br>
LOMAR D. for example.<br>
[0020] The polynaphthalenesulfonates useful in the present invention have the<br>
general structure (I):<br>
 <br>
(I)<br>
wherein n is &gt;2, and wherein M is sodium, potassium, calcium, and the like.<br>
(0021] The naphthalenesulfonate dispersant, preferably as an about 45% by<br>
weight solution in water, may be used in a range of from about 0.5% to about 3.0%<br>
by weight based on the weight of dry stucco used in the gypsum composite<br>
formulation. A more preferred range of naphthalenesulfonate dispersant is from<br>
about 0.5% to about 2.0% by weight based on the weight of dry stucco, and a most<br>
preferred range from about 0.7% to about 2.0% by weight based on the weight of<br>
dry stucco. In contrast, known gypsum wallboard contains this dispersant at levels<br>
of about 0.4% by weight, or less, based on the weight of dry stucco.<br>
(0022] Stated in an another way, the naphthalenesulfonate dispersant, on a dry<br>
weight basis, may be used in a range from about 0.1% to about 1.5% by weight<br>
based of the weight of dry stucco used in the gypsum composite formulation. A<br>
more preferred range of naphthalenesulfonate dispersant, on a dry solids basis, is<br>
from about 0.25% to about 0.7% by weight based on the weight of dry stucco, and<br>
 <br>
a most preferred range (on a dry solids basis) from about 0.3% to about 0.7% by<br>
weight based on the weight of dry stucco.<br>
[0023] The gypsum-containing slurry can optionally contain a trimetaphosphate<br>
salt, for example, sodium trimetaphosphate. Any suitable water-soluble<br>
metaphosphate or polyphosphate can be used in accordance with the present<br>
invention. It is preferred that a trimetaphosphate salt be used, including double<br>
salts, that is trimetaphosphate salts having two cations. Particularly useful<br>
trimetaphosphate salts include sodium trimetaphosphate, potassium<br>
trimetaphosphate, calcium trimetaphosphate, sodium calcium trimetaphosphate,<br>
lithium trimetaphosphate, ammonium trimetaphosphate, and the like, or<br>
combinations thereof. A preferred trimetaphosphate salt is sodium<br>
trimetaphosphate. It is preferred to use the trimetaphosphate salt as an aqueous<br>
solution, for example, in the range of about 10-15% by weight solids content. Other<br>
cyclic or acyclic polyphosphates can also be used, as described in U.S. Patent No.<br>
6,409,825 to Yu et a!., herein incorporated by reference.<br>
[0024] Sodium trimetaphosphate is a known additive in gypsum-containing<br>
compositions, although it is generally used in a range of from about 0.05% to about<br>
0.08% by weight based on the weight of dry stucco used in the gypsum slurry. In<br>
the embodiments of the present invention, sodium trimetaphosphate (or other<br>
water-soluble metaphosphate or polyphosphate) can be present in the range of<br>
from about 0.12% to about 0.4% by weight based on the weight of dry stucco used<br>
in the gypsum composite formulation. A preferred range of sodium<br>
trimetaphosphate (or other water-soluble metaphosphate or polyphosphate) is from<br>
about 0.12% to about 0.3% by weight based on the weight of dry stucco used in the<br>
gypsum composite formulation.<br>
[0025] There are two forms of stucco, alpha and beta. These two types of<br>
stucco are produced by different means of calcination. In the present inventions<br>
either the beta or the alpha form of stucco may be used.<br>
[0026] Starches, including pregeiatinized starch in particular, must be used in<br>
gypsum-containing slurries prepared in accordance with the present invention. A<br>
 <br>
preferred pregelatinized starch is pregelatinized com starch, for example<br>
pregelatinized corn flour available from Bunge Milling, St Louis, Missouri, having<br>
the following typical analysis: moisture 7.5%, protein 8.0%, oil 0.5%, crude fiber<br>
0.5%, ash 0.3%; having a green strength of 0.48 psi; and having a loose bulk<br>
density of 35.0 Ib/ft3. Pregelatinized com starch should be used in an amount of at<br>
least about 0.5% by weight up to about 10% by weight, based on the weight of dry<br>
stucco used in the gypsum-containing slurry.<br>
[0027] The present inventors have further discovered that an unexpected<br>
increase in dry strength (particularly in wallboard) can be obtained by using at least<br>
about 0.5% by weight up to about 10% by weight pregelatinized starch (preferably<br>
pregelatinized corn starch) in the presence of about 0.1% by weight to 3.0% by<br>
weight naphthalenesulfonate dispersant (starch and naphthalenesulfonate levels<br>
based on the weight of dry stucco present in the formulation). This unexpected<br>
result can be obtained whether or not water-soluble metaphosphate or<br>
polyphosphate is present.<br>
[0028] In addition, it has unexpectedly been found that pregelatinized starch can<br>
be used at levels of at least about 10 Ib/MSF, or more, in the dried gypsum<br>
wallboard made in accordance with the present invention, yet high strength and low<br>
weight can be achieved. Levels as high as 35-45 Ib/MSF pregelatinized starch in<br>
the gypsum wallboard have been shown to be effective. As an example,<br>
Formulation B, as shown in Tables 1 and 2 below, includes 45 Ib/MSF, yet<br>
produced a board weight of 1042 Ib/MSF having excellent strength. In this<br>
example (Formulation B), a naphthalenesulfonate dispersant as a 45% by weight<br>
solution in water, was used at a level of 1.28% by weight.<br>
[0029] A further unexpected result may be achieved with the present invention<br>
when the naphthalenesulfonate dispersant trimetaphosphate salt combination is<br>
combined with pregelatinized com starch, and optionally, paper fiber or glass fiber.<br>
Gypsum wallboard made from formulations containing these three ingredients have<br>
increased strength and reduced weight, and are more economically desirable due<br>
to the reduced water requirements in their manufacture.<br>
 <br>
[0030] Accelerators can be used in the gypsum-containing compositions of the<br>
present invention, as described in U.S. Patent No. 6,409,825 to Yu et al.. herein<br>
incorporated by reference. One desirable heat resistant accelerator (HRA) can be<br>
made from the dry grinding of iandplaster (calcium sulfate dihydrate). Small<br>
amounte of additives (normally about 5% by weight) such as sugar, dextrose, boric<br>
acid, and starch can be used to make this HRA. Sugar, or dextrose, is currently<br>
preferred. Another useful accelerator is "climate stabilized accelerator" or "climate<br>
stable accelerator," (CSA) as described in U.S. Patent No. 3,673,947, herein<br>
incorporated by reference.<br>
[0031] Water/stucco (w/s) ratio is an important parameter, since excess water<br>
must eventually be driven off by heating. In the embodiments of the present<br>
invention, a generally preferred w/s ratio is from about 0.7 to about 1.3. A more<br>
prefenred w/s ratio in the main gypsum slurry formulations should be in the range<br>
from 0.8-1.2.<br>
[0032] Other gypsum slurry additives can include accelerators, binders,<br>
waterproofing agents, paper or glass fitters and other known constituents.<br>
(0033] The following examples further illustrate the invention. They should not<br>
be construed as in any way limiting the scope of the invention.<br>

EXAMPLE 2<br>
[0036] Preparation of Wallboards<br>
[0037] Sample gypsum wallboards were prepared in accordance with U.S.<br>
Patent Nos. 6.342,284 to Yu et al. and 6.632.550 to Yu et al., herein incorporated<br>
by reference. This includes the separate generation of foam and introduction of the<br>
foam into the slurry of all of the other ingredients as described in Example 5 of<br>
these patents.<br>
[0038] Test results for gypsum wallboards made using the Formulations A and B<br>
of Example 1, and a normal control board are shown in Table 2 below. As in this<br>
example and other examples below, nail pull resistance, core hardness, and<br>
flexural strength tests were performed according to ASTM C-473. Additionally, it is<br>
noted that typical gypsum wallboard is approximately 1/2 inch thick and has a weight<br>
of between about 1600 to 1800 pounds per 1,000 square feet of material, or<br>
 <br>
Ib/MSF. ("MSF" is a standard abbreviation in the art for a thousand square feet; it is<br>
an area measurement for boxes, corrugated media and wallboard.)<br>
 <br>
MD: machine direction<br>
XMD: across machine direction<br>
[0039] As illustrated in Table 2, gypsum wallboards prepared using the<br>
Formulation A and B slurries have significant reductions in weight compared to the<br>
control board. With reference again to Table 1, the comparisons of the Formulation<br>
A board to the Formulation B board are most striking. The water/stucco (w/s) ratios<br>
are similar in Formulation A and Formulation B, A significantly higher level of<br>
naphthalenesulfonate dispersant is also used in Formulation B. Also, in<br>
Formulation B substantially more pregelatinized starch was used, about 6% by<br>
weight, a greater than 100% increase over Formulation A accompanied by marked<br>
strength increases. Even so, the water demand to produce the required flowability<br>
remained low in the Formulation B slurry, the difference being about 10% in<br>
 <br>
comparison to Formulation A. The low water demand in both Formulations is<br>
attributed to the synergistic effect of the combination of naphthalenesulfonate<br>
dispersant and sodium trimetaphosphate in the gypsum slurry, which increases the<br>
fluidity of the gypsum slurry, even in the presence of a substantially higher level of<br>
pregelatinized starch.<br>
[0040] As illustrated in Table 2, the wallboard prepared using the Formulation B<br>
slurry has substantially increased strength compared with the wallboard prepared<br>
using the Formulation A slurry. By incorporating increased amounts of<br>
pregelatinized starch in combination with increased amounts of<br>
naphthalenesulfonate dispersant and sodium trimetaphosphate, nail pull resistance<br>
in the Formulation B board improved by 45% over the Formulation A board.<br>
Substantial increases in flexural strength were also observed in the Formulation B<br>
board as compared to the Formulation A board.<br>

[0042] Further gypsum wallboard examples (Boards C, D and E), including<br>
slurry formulations and test results are shown in Table 3 below. The slurry<br>

 DILOFLO is a 45% Naphthalensulfonate solution in water<br>
[0043] As illustrated in Table 3, Boards C. D, and E were made from a slurry<br>
having substantially increased amounts of starch, DILOFLO dispersant, and sodium<br>
trimetaphosphate in comparison with the control board (about a two-fold increase<br>
 <br>
on a percentage basis for the starch and dispersant. and a two- to three-fold<br>
increase for the trimetaphosphate), while maintaining the w/s ratio constant.<br>
Nevertheless, board weight was significantly reduced and strength as measured by<br>
nail pull resistance was not dramatically affected. Therefore, in this example of an<br>
embodiment of the invention, the new formulation (such as, for example, Board D)<br>
can provide increased starch formulated in a usable, flowable slurry, while<br>
maintaining the same w/s ratio and adequate strength.<br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
[0044J Wet Gypsum Cube Strength Test<br>
[0045) The wet cube strength tests were carried out by using Southard CKS<br>
board stucco, available from United States Gypsum Corp., Chicago, Illinois and tap<br>
water in the laboratory to determine their wet compressive strength. The following<br>
lab test procedure was used.<br>
(0046] Stucco (1000 g), CSA (2 g), and tap water (1200 cc) at about 70°F were<br>
used for each wet gypsum cube cast. Pregelatinized com starch (20 g, 2.0% based<br>
on stucco wt.) and CSA (2 g, 0.2% based on stucco wt.) were thoroughly dry mixed<br>
first in a plastic bag with the stucco prior to mixing with a tap water solution<br>
containing both naphthalenesulfonate dispersant and sodium trimetaphosphate.<br>
The dispersant used was DILOFLO dispersant (1.0-2.0%, as indicated in Table<br>
4). Varying amounts of sodium trimetaphosphate were used also as indicated in<br>
Table 4.<br>
[0047] The dry ingredients and aqueous solution were initially combined in a<br>
laboratory Warning blender, the mixture produced allowed to soak for 10 sec, and<br>
then the mixture was mixed at low speed for 10 sec in order to make the slurry.<br>
The slurries thus formed were cast into three 2"X2"X2" cube molds. The cast<br>
cubes were then removed from the molds, weighed, and sealed inside plastic bags<br>
to prevent moisture loss before the compressive strength test was performed. The<br>
compressive strength of the wet cubes was measured using an ATS machine and<br>
recorded as an average in pounds per square inch (psi). The results obtained were<br>
as follows:<br>

[0048] As illustrated in Table 4. Samples 4-5, 10-11, and 17, having levels of<br>
sodium trimetaphosphate in the about 0.12 - 0.4 % range of the present invention<br>
generally provided superior wet cube compressive strength as compared to<br>
samples with sodium trimetaphosphate outside this range.<br>

[0049] 1/2 Inch Light Weight Gypsum Wallboard Plant Production Trials<br>
[0050] Further trials were performed (Trial Boards 1 and 2). including sluny<br>
formulations and test results are shown in Table 5 below. The slurry formulations<br>
of Table 5 include the major components of the slurries. Values in parentheses are<br>
expressed as weight percent based on the weight of dry stucco.<br>

50% are acceptable.<br>
[0051] As illustrated in Table 5, Trial Boards 1 and 2 were made from a slurry<br>
having substantially increased amounts of starch, DILOFLO dispersant, and sodium<br>
trimetaphosphate, while slightly decreasing the w/s ratio, in comparison with the<br>
control boards. Nevertheless, strength as measured by nail pull resistance and<br>
 <br>
flexural testing was maintained or improved, and board weight was significantly<br>
reduced. Therefore, in this example of an embodiment of the invention, the new<br>
formulation (such as, for example, Trial Boards 1 and 2) can provide increased<br>
trimetaphosphate and starch formulated in a usable, flowable slurry, while<br>
maintaining substantially the same w/s ratio and adequate strength.<br>
EXAMPLE 6<br>
[0052] 1/2 Inch Ultra-Light Weight Gypsum Wallboard Plant Production Trials<br>
(00S3] Further trials were performed (Trial Boards 3 and 4} using Formulation B<br>
(Example 1} as in Example 2, except that the pregelatinized com starch was<br>
prepared with water at 10% concentration (wet starch preparation) and a blend of<br>
HYONIC 25 AS and PFM 33 soaps (available from GEO Specialty Chemicals,<br>
Lafayette, Indiana) was used. For example, Trial Board 3 was prepared with a<br>
blend of HYONIC 25 AS and PFM 33 ranging from 65-70% by weight of 25AS, and<br>
the balance PFM 33. For example, Trial Board 4 was prepared with a 70/30 wt./wt.<br>
blend of HYONIC 25AS /HYONIC PFM 33. The trial results are shown in Table 6<br>
below.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
[0054] As illustrated in Table 6, strength characteristics as measured by nail pull<br>
and core hardness were above the ASTM standard. Flexural strength was also<br>
measured to be above the ASTM standard. Again, in this example of an<br>
embodiment of the invention, the new formulation (such as, for example, Trial<br>
Boards 3 and 4) can provide increased trimetaphosphate and starch formulated in<br>
a usable, flowable slurry, while maintaining adequate strength.<br>

composite board is shown in Table 7 below. All values in Table 7 are expressed as<br>
 <br>
 <br>
B. Preparation of Composite Boards with Dry Pregelatinized Starch<br>
[0057] The composite boards were prepared as in Example 2, using Formulation<br>
C above, with the following exceptions. Dry powder pregelatinized com starch was<br>
used to prepare the slurry. Heavy Manila paper (60 Ib/MSF, caliper 0.018 in.) was<br>
used as the top (face) cover sheet, to which was applied 6-8% by weight of the<br>
non-foamed high density gypsum slurry having a wet density of 80 pcf, across the<br>
entire surface of the paper. After application of the main foamed slurry, the bottom<br>
(back) cover sheet was applied, (News-Line paper - 42 Ib/MSF, caliper 0.0125 in.)<br>
which included on its gypsum core-facing surface 4-6% by weight of the non-<br>
foamed high density gypsum slurry having a wet density of 80-85 pcf, across the<br>
entire surface of the paper.<br>
 <br>
C. Preparation of Composite Boards with Wet Pregelatinized Starch<br>
[0058] Composite boards were prepared as set forth above, except that the<br>
pregelatinized com starch was prepared in solution with water at 10% concentration<br>
(wet starch preparation).<br>
EXAMPLE 8<br>
[0059] Testing of 1/2 Inch Ultra-Light Weight Composite Gypsum Board<br>
[0060J Test results for composite gypsum boards prepared in Examples 7B and<br>
7C are shown in Table 8 below. As In this example and other examples, nail pull<br>
resistance, core hardness, and flexural strength tests were performed according to<br>
ASTM C-473. 2 ft. X 4fL trial board samples were tested after conditioning at<br>
70°F/50°R.H.<br>
 <br>
[0061] As illustrated in Table 8, the Example 7C. composite board exceeds the<br>
ASTM standard for nail pull resistance, and essentially meets the core hardness<br>
standard (see Table 6). This demonstrates that the use of strong, heavy face paper<br>
and regular back paper, both adhered to a low density core using a non-foamed<br>
high density bonding layer, can provide a board having light weight, and increased<br>
strength.<br>
