FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a novel process for the chiral resolution of 2-substituted 4-substituted 1,3-oxathiolanes and derivatives thereof of general formula (I):<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
The present invention also relates to novel 2-substituted 4-substituted 1,3-oxathiolanes derivatives.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Classes of compounds known as 2-substituted 4-substituted 1,3-oxathiolanes, in particular derivatives of analogues of pyrimidine nucleosides have been found to have potent antiviral activity. In particular, these compounds have been found to act as potent inhibitors of HIV-1 replication in T-lymphocytes over a prolonged period of time with less cytotoxic side effects than compounds known in the art (see for example Belleau et. al. (1993) Bioorg.Med.Chem.Lett. Vol. 3, No.8, 1723-1728). These compounds have also been found active against 3TC-resistant HIV strains (see for example Taylor et. al. (2000) Antiviral Chem.Chemother. Vol.11, No.4, 291-301; and Stoddart et. al. (2000) Antimicrob. Agenst Chemother. Vol. 44, No.3, 783-786). These compounds are also useful in prophylaxis and treatment of hepatitis B virus infections. These compounds may be produced in accordance with the methods disclosed in WO 92/08717, WO 95/29176, WO 02/102796 and WO 2006/096954.<br>
Compounds of the 2-substituted 4-substituted 1,3-oxathiolane family contain two chiral centres. Compounds that contain two chiral centres can exist as a mixture of four stereoisomers, where the configuration at the two chiral centres is (R,R) or (R,S) or (S,R) or<br>
 (S,S). The (R,R) and (S,S) forms are known as cis enantiomers as they are non-superimposible mirror images of each other and the (R,S) and (S,R) forms are known as the trans enantiomers for the same reason. For human therapeutic use it is usually typically required to isolate the compound in only one of the stereoisomeric forms, also known as a chirally pure form. It can be that synthesis of a single stereoisomer can be achieved from a starting material with a single chiral centre in enantiomerically pure form or a suitable intermediate.<br>
For example, cw-2-hydroxymethyl-4-(cytosin-l'-yl)-l,3-oxathiolane may be produced by the methods described by Mansour et al., "Anti-Human Immunodeficiency Virus and Anti-Hepatitis-B Virus Activities and Toxicities of the Enantiomers of 2'-Deoxy-3'-oxa-4'-thiacytidine and Their 5-Fluoro Analogues in vitro", J. Med. Chem., (1995), Vol. 38, No. 1, 1-4, as well as the methods disclosed in US patent No 6,228,860, Nucleosides and Nucleotides, (1995) 14(3-5) 627-735 and Caputo et. al. in Eur.j.Org.Chem. (1999) Vol.6, 1455-1458.<br>
However methods of synthesis do not always form the new chiral centres stereospecifically, but instead give a ratio know as the enantiomeric excess (ee):<br>
ee - [(% desired isomer)-(% opposite isomer)] sum (desired +opposite isomer)<br>
When compounds are desired as a single form, for example, if only the two (/?, R) and (S, S) cis enantiomers are present, a single form being either the (R, R) or the (S, S) form, may be obtained by resolution of the mixture of the two cis enantiomers by chiral HPLC. A review of this technology may be found in "Enantiomers, Racemates and Resolutions" by J. Jacques, A. Collet &amp; S.H. Wilen (John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1981).<br>
Alternatively, compounds or any convenient intermediate may be resolved by enzyme mediated enantioselective catabolism with a suitable enzyme such as cytidine deaminase or selective enzymatic degradation of a suitable derivative (see for example Storer et. al., "The resolution and Absolute Stereochemistry of the Enantiomers of cis<br>
l[2(Hydroxomethyl)-l,3-Oxathiolan-5-Yl)Cytosine (BCH-189): Equipotent Anti-HIV Agents", Nucleosides &amp; Nucleotides, (1993) 12(2), 225-236).<br>
The reaction of a racemic mixture of a compound with an optically active resolving acid or base can also be used for the enantiomeric resolution of the compound. For example, WO 2006/096954 discloses a method for the preparation of optically active cis 1,3-oxathiolanes. The method involves, (a) reacting a 1,3-oxathiolane compound in the cis configuration with a chiral acid to produce two diastereomeric salts; (b) recovering one of the two diastereomeric salts; and (c) desalting to remove the chiral acid. Preferred chiral acids include (+)-L-tartaric acid, (lR)-(-)-10-camphorsulfonic acid, (-)-2,3-dibenzoyl-tartaric acid or (-)-L-malic acid. The method also discloses the addition of an achiral acid together with the chiral acid to produce the two diastereomeric salts. A disadvantage with the method of WO 2006/096954 however, is the salt formation step. This step requires the use of chiral acid reagents and in some cases also achiral acids. The salt formation step also requires the introduction of a further desalting step to obtain the desired optically active cis product.<br>
The use of additional reagents, such as chiral acids, and extra steps in a process, such as the desalting step required in the method of WO 2006/096954, are undesirable in a commercial setting as they add to production costs as well as increase the production time of the desired product. Furthermore, with each additional step in a process, there is the potential for inefficient recovery of the final end product due to losses occurring with each step of the process.<br>
The present inventors have found that by the correct choice of groups R2, R3 and R4, an optically active compound of general formula (II) or (III) may be obtained by selective recrystallisation. The present inventors have also found that the recrystallisation solvent of choice is selected on the basis of groups R2, R3 and R4. The present invention avoids the salting and desalting steps required by previous methods and provides a simpler, more efficient process to produce optically active cis 1,3-oxathiolanes. In a particularly preferred aspect the invention provides a way of separating an undesired diastereomer such as the trans diastereomer and enhancing the optical purity of the cis isomer by<br>
 <br>
recrystallisation. The present invention also provides novel 2-substituted 4-substituted 1,3-oxathiolane derivatives.<br>

General synthesis of 2-substituted 4-substituted 1,3-oxathiolanes<br>
The synthesis of a 2-substituted 4-substituted 1,3-oxathiolane may be carried out by a number of methods to provide a mixture of the four stereoisomers, these being the two cis isomers and the two trans isomers, in proportions as shown in Table 1.<br>
Table 1<br>
<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
In accordance with the present invention, a compound of general formula (II) or (III) is produced by reacting a base of general formula (IV) with a 1,3-oxathiolane of general formula (V) to produce a compound of general formula (II) or (III) as shown in Scheme 1:<br>
<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Scheme I: Synthesis of optically active compounds (II) and (III) by reaction of a base (IV)<br>
with a 1,3-oxathiolane (V)<br>
A compound of general formula (II) or (III) may also be produced by reacting a silylated base of general formula (X) with a 1,3-oxathiolane of general formula (V) as shown in Scheme 2 where RIO is a silyl protecting group.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Scheme 2: Synthesis of optically active compounds (II) and (III) by reaction of a silylated<br>
base (X) with a 1,3-oxathiolane (V)<br>
The 1,3-oxathiolane of general formula (V) is at least 60% ee of the (R) enantiomer, preferably at least 70%, more preferably greater than 85% ee, even more preferably greater than 95% ee and still more preferably greater than 99% ee. The skilled addressee will appreciate that the amount of compound (II) and compound (III) obtained from the reactions illustrated in Schemes 1 and 2 will depend on the %ee of the (R) enantiomer compound (V). When the %ee of the (R) enantiomer of compound (V) is, for example, greater than 95%, then the {R,R) cis isomer of general formula (II) will be the major isomer formed. As the %ee of the (R) enantiomer of compound (V) decreases the amount of compound (II) formed decreases and the amount of compound (III) increases accordingly. The trans isomers are also formed in the process.<br>
Particularly preferred general reaction conditions according to an embodiment of the invention involves the coupling of N-benzoylcytosine (2) with 2-benzoyloxymethyl-l,3-oxathiolane-S-oxide (1) in the presence of trimethylsilyliodide (TMSI), triethylamine and catalytic amounts of copper(II)chloride in dichloromethane (Scheme 3).<br>
(Structure Removed)<br>
Scheme 3: Reaction of N-benzylcytosine with 2-benzoyloxymethyl-l ,3-oxathiolane-S-oxide<br>
The reaction proceeds through initial activation of (1) undergoing a Sila-Pumerrer rearrangement. Copper(II)chloride is believed to play a role on inducing a p attack of silylated benzoyl cytosine, resulting in an increase in cis selectivity during the coupling. However this increase in cis selectivity is modest and the amount of CuCb can be reduced without a significant effect on the reaction. The Sila-Pummerrer rearrangement of (1) is conducted at -50°C and the coupling with the base to proceed at 0°C overnight, before warming to room temperature and quenching.<br>
The quenched crude reaction mixture was filtered through celite which reduced the problem of solid formation which can complicate the workup process. The filtered reaction mixture was washed with dilute aqueous ammonia and dilute phosphoric acid. The resulting crude reaction mixture was purified by recrystallizing in methanol. Recrystallization in methanol gives the desired cis isomer almost exclusively. Recrystallization in methanol also enhances the optical purity and by using the technique of entrainment, optical purity can be improved further. This finding is particularly useful<br>
when starting with less optically pure starting material and is a particularly important finding of the present invention.<br>
Selective recrystallisation<br>
The inventors have found that a correct choice of the groups R2, R3 and R4 is required for selective recrystallisation of an optically active compound of general formula (II) or (III) from the mixture. The choice of recrystallisation solvent is also dependent on the nature of the groups R2, R3 and R4.<br>
Cytosine protected with acetyl, isobutyrylcarbonyl, pivalylcarbonyl, cyclohexylcarbonyl, p-toluoyl and benzoyl groups was coupled with BOMO-sulfoxide as shown in Scheme 4.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Scheme 4: Coupling of protected cytosine with BOMO-sulfoxide<br>
For example, when R2 is benzoyl, R5-H, R3=H and R4=Acetyl, recrystallisation from a mixture of cis isomers (R,R and S,S) (compounds II and III) and trans isomers (R,S and S,R) (compounds XI and XII) does not give any separation as shown in Table 2. It was found that the benzoyl protected cytosine coupled product crystallizes efficiently with high cis selectivity.<br>
Table 2<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
By correct choice of the groups R2, R3 and R4 conditions can be selected that lead to the selective resolution of a compound of, for example, formula (II) by recrystallisation from a mixture of all four stereoisomers. As shown in Table 2, where R2=benzoyl and R3=H, and if R4 is varied as follows then R4=benzoyl was found to give the recrystallisation to chirally pure compound, while R4=acetyl or pivalyl or isobutyryl failed to selectively recrystallise the desired chirally pure compound.<br>
Accordingly, in a preferred embodiment of the process according to the first, second, third, fourth, sixth, seventh, eighth and tenth aspects of the present invention, R3 or R4 of the compound of general formula II or III is benzoyl. In a preferred embodiment, R2 of the compound of general formula II or III is also benzoyl.<br>
Cis selective recrystallisation<br>
One of the most attractive advantages of the N-benzoyl route is that the recrystallisations in methanol almost exclusively yield the desired cis (R,R) isomer. Preferred embodiments of the present invention show that at 5 g and 10 g scale reactions when using 0.2 equivalents of CuCb, the reactions were cis selective with selectivity between 2.86:1 (74%) to 2.5:1 (71%). Recrystallizing in 14 - 15 x volumes of methanol (as compared to the mass of the crude) gave almost exclusively the cis isomer.<br>
Recrystallisation solvents<br>
The recrystallisation solvent of choice is therefore a C^alcohol or mixtures of C|. 6alcohols. The C alcohol may be a straight chain or branched chain alcohol. Methanol (MeOH), ethanol (EtOH), propanol and butanol are preferred and of these, methanol is particularly preferred. As shown in Tables 3 and 4, MeOH is particularly preferred to give the compound (II) in ee of greater than 99%.<br>
Table 3<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Table 4<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Mixed solvent systems<br>
Recrystallizations with entrainment in mixed solvent systems was examined. Mixtures of C^alcohols are also preferred recrystallisation solvents including mixtures of MeOH and another C2-6alcohol such as EtOH, propanol, butanol, pentanol and hexanol in a variety of ratios of MeOH:C2-6alcohol from about 2:98 to 98:2, about 5:95 to 95:5, about 10:90 to 90:10, about 20:80 to 80:20 or about 30:70 to 70:30. A preferred ratio of MeOH:C2. 6alcohol is 90:10 and particularly preferred is a ratio of MeOH:C2-6alcohol 95:5. It is preferred that the Ci-6alcohol or mixtures thereof contains no more than 5% water.<br>
All recrystallizations were seeded at 53°C, 14mg of seed /g crude, stirred at 1000 rpm, with xl4 volumes of solvent. Recrystallizations were done on a crude mixture coming from a reaction where the starting BOMO R/S ratio was 80/20 (actual R/S ratio: 82:18).   The<br>
results are shown in Table 5. However, in contrast to the recrystallization results shown in Tables 10 and 11 below, HPLC analysis of crude gave an approximate crude R/S ratio of 86 /14. However when R/S ratio decreases, specially below 90: 10, there is a propensity for trans isomer to also crystallize (Table 9 below). In this set of experiments, the trans isomer was observed uniformly about 10-12%. Therefore the observed RR/SS ratio was corrected for the presence of RR and SS trans isomers. Regardless, there was a substantial improvement in optical activity. 100% methanol is particularly preferred as shown in Table 5. Mixtures of methanol, for example with 5% 1-propanol or 5% 1-butanol, are also particularly preferred.<br>
Table 5<br>
<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Note: This set of recrystallizations was done on a crude mixture coming from a reaction where the starting BOMO R/S ratio was 80/20 (actual R/S ratio: 82:18).<br>
 <br>
Enhancement of optical purity<br>
Enhancement of optical purity is a desirable advantage of the present invention making possible the use of a starting material with a lower optical purity to yield a recrystallised product with higher optical purity, leading to a lower production cost.<br>
Repetition of recrystallisation step and entrainment<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the selective recrystallisation step (b) in accordance with the first, second, third, fourth, seventh, eighth and tenth aspects is repeated at least once. The repetition of the selective recrystallisation step may facilitate an increase in the overall yield of the desired enantiomer as an additional amount of the desired enantiomer may be recovered as a result of the repeated step. It will be understood however that the the recrystallisation step may also be repeated to selectively recrystallise an isomer which was not obtained in the first selective recrystallisation step. Thus, for example, the desired /?,/?-enantiomer may be selectively recrystallised in the first recrystallisation step and the S.S-enantiomer may be selectively recrystallised in the second recrystallisation step.<br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment, the selective recrystallisation step (b) in accordance with the first, second, third, fourth, seventh, eighth and tenth aspects is an entrainment or a cyclic entrainment process. The inventors have surprisingly found that the yield of a preferred single enantiomer can be increased by entrainment. As demonstrated by the results obtained in Example 3 of the Experimental Section the addition of a small amount of the /?,7?-enantiomer favours the recrystallisation of the R,R-enantiomer. This seeding or entrainment process therefore advantageously increases the recrystallised yield of the desired enantiomer. The results obtained in Example 3 are shown in Table 6<br>
 <br>
RR / SS ratio with Entrainment<br>
Table 6 (Table Removed)<br>
<br>
As can be seen from Table 7, supplied BOMOs were of varied purity.<br>
Table 7<br>
<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Note that the samples often contained other impurities as well, which is the reason for differing R/S ratios as compared to HPLC analysis.<br>
Optical purity enhancement via two recrystallisations<br>
The results from doing two recrystallizations in order to obtain very pure product are shown in Table 8. These recrystallizations were done without entrainment. Interestingly the solubility of the pure product appeared to be lower in methanol as compared to the crude product. This may be because that impurities present could be helping to solubilize the product. For example the crude product could be recrystallized in refluxing (10-15 x) methanol readily. However with pure product we found that it was not easy to dissolve product even in x25 volumes of refluxing methanol, generally we used x 40 volumes of refluxing methanol (in the example below we used x30 volumes), but still with high recovery.<br>
'Pure' R BOMO (R/S ratio 98.3 / 1.7) was used in the experiment. The first recrystallization in xl5 volumes of methanol yielded a product with a RR/SS ratio of 99.13 / 0.87. The 2nd recrystallization (in x30 volumes of methanol) increased the RR/SS ratio to 99.6/0.4 with a recovery of 95%. Because the recovery from the second recrystallization is high a second recrystallization could also be attractive when there is some trans isomer left from the first recrystallization.<br>
Table 8<br>
<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Therefore, the starting BOMO used in the coupling reaction can be of lower purity (i.e. R:S ratio) in view of the ability to increase the RR/SS ratio of the final coupled product using the recrystallisation method of the present invention.<br>
Optical purity enhancement via entrainment<br>
A racemic mixture of enantiomers can be resolved during the crystallization process. A mixture of enantiomers can crystallize either by the formation of a racemic compound or by the formation of a conglomerate.   In a racemic compound, the crystals are in a lattice<br>
with a regular arrangement of both enantiomers in equal amounts. However in a conglomerate, molecules of one enantiomer is preferentially attracted to the same enantiomer, thus crystallizes as a physical mixture of crystals belonging to one enantiomer or the other. If the material of interest crystallizes as a conglomerate, then a process known as entrainment (essentially by using the pure crystals as seeds for crystallization of the enantiomer of interest) could be used to preferentially crystallize the desired enantiomer, enhancing the optical purity.<br>
Entrainment could be affected by many variables:<br>
•	Temperature at which the seeding is conducted: If the temperature is too low, natural crystallization may have started. If the temperature is too high some of the seed crystals added would dissolve;<br>
•	The amount of seed crystals used;<br>
•	Purity and the particle size of the seeds;<br>
•	Rate of stirring during the crystallization;<br>
•	Time length of stirring;<br>
•	Volume of the solvent -methanol;<br>
•	Quality of the crude also could play a role. For example we have found that the pure product is less soluble in methanol than in the presence of impurities.<br>
Optical purity enhancement during recrystallization when the starting BOMO is an R/S mixture<br>
R/S BOMO mixtures (at different ratios from 100:0 R/S to 50:50) were oxidized to the corresponding S-oxide with H2O2 / HOAc, and then without crystallizing the resulting S-oxide this was coupled with benzoyl cytosine. It was hypothesized that if it was possible for the S-oxide itself to crystallize via conglomerate formation, then, a removed portion from this non-homogeneous mixture may yield a different optical bias than intended. The reaction was worked up the usual way, and the crude was recrystallized with and without entrainment.<br>
First all solvent was removed from the crude material. This was then refluxed in 14 volumes of methanol till all the material was in solution. Next this was allowed to cool with stirring while monitoring the temperature. At the temperature of approximately 55°C, the stirred mixture was seeded with Pure 'R,R' isomer, allowed to come to room temperature and stirred overnight. The crystallized mixture was then filtered, washed with methanol and analyzed via chiral HPLC. As a control an identical sample was refluxed in methanol till all were in solution, and then allowed to cool without any stirring or seeding.<br>
In summary, the results in Table 9 below show that there is a substantial optical purity enhancement during the crystallization, even without entrainment. Even with a starting BOMO R/S ratio of 80/20, the RR/SS ratio, even without entrainment has increased to 95/5. However with entrainment, the enhancement is even higher. Starting BOMO R/S ratio of as low as 90/10 gave a final purity over 99%, while an R/S ratio of 80/20 gave a purity over 98%. This information shows that starting BOMO need not be highly pure to get a high product purity. However it is also interesting to note that as the optical purity of the starting material goes down, the quality of the cis-trans separation also decreases. Generally below R/S ratio of 90/10, trace presence of the trans isomer could be seen (see entries 4 and 5, Table 9). However a second recrystallization should remove this trans isomer as previously discussed.<br>

NOTE: When the presence of trans is less than 4-5%, NMR estimation is not accurate due to noise etc., under standard NMR acquisition conditions.<br>
Optical purity enhancement during recrystallization of'S' BOMO reactions<br>
With a true conglomerate, entrainment induced optical purity enhancement could occur with either enantiomers. To test this, an analogous reaction with a sulfoxide derived from S enriched BOMO (R/S ratio 12/88) was conducted. The crude reaction mixture derived from the coupling of S-BOMO sulfoxide with benzoyl cytosine was recrystallized with and without entrainment. Indeed the results shown in Table 10 with entrainment were similar to the analogous experiment where R/S ratio was 90/10.<br>

Examination of the variables affecting entrainment<br>
Time<br>
Generally a time effect on the optical purity was observed. Standing overnight was found to be optimum and convenient. At 1.5 hours or 3 hours intervals it appeared the crystallization was not complete and thus generally overnight standing was used (Tables 12 and 13). Keeping more than 1 day, while improved the purity, did not improve the purity significantly more.<br>
Table 11 shows the results of a study where crude (Starting R/S ratio: 97/3) was recrystallized with 14 volumes of methanol.<br>
Table 11<br>
<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Stirring and Seeding<br>
To test the effects of the variables, seeding and stirring, the following experiments were done. Even though the reaction was done using 80:20, R/S mixture of BOMO (actual R/S ratio: 82:18), for these experiments the crude itself was analyzed separately via HPLC.<br>
For these experiments, all solvent is removed from the crude material first. This is then refluxed in 14 volumes of methanol until all material is in solution. Next this is allowed to cool with stirring (at the specified rate) or without stirring, while monitoring the temperature. At the temperature of 55°C, the stirred mixture is seeded with Pure 'R,R' cis isomer or not seeded and stirred overnight while allowing the temperature to come to room temperature. The crystallized mixture is then filtered, washed with methanol and analyzed via HPLC. The results are shown in Table 12. These results show that stirring is always better than no stirring. It may be that stirring could generate seeds and distribute them all over,   stirring   without   adding   seeds   give   higher   optical   purity   products   than<br>
 <br>
recrystallizations where seeds had been added, but no stirring is done.   Crystallization is essentially complete by 1 day, but purity improves slightly with time (Table 11).<br>

(Table Removed)<br>
Note: This set of recrystallizations was done on a crude mixture coming from a reaction where the starting BOMO R/S ratio was 80/20 (actual R/S ratio: 82:18). However HPLC analysis of crude gave an approximate R/S ratio of 95.3/4.7.<br>
Temperature<br>
The results obtained in Table 13 possibly shows that, at temperatures above 55°C (or so), seeds partially dissolve. Thus temperatures below 55°C are better. On the other hand at lower temperatures there is competing natural seeding, especially with high rates of seeding. This also could decrease the effectiveness of entrainment.<br>

Note: This set of recrystallizations were done on the same crude mixture used for Table 10, coming from a reaction where the starting BOMO R/S ratio was 80/20 (actual R/S ratio: 82:18). However HPLC analysis of crude gave an approximate R/S ratio of 95.3/4.7. No Trans isomer was seen in the recrystallized mixture<br>
In yet another preferred embodiment, the 2-substituted 4-substituted 1,3-oxathiolane of general formula (II) or general formula (III) produced or formed in step (a) in accordance with the first, second, third, fourth, seventh, eighth and tenth aspects, is in the form of a conglomerate. The ability of these compounds to form conglomerates is surprising when taking into consideration that only 5% to 10% of racemates belong to the conglomerate forming group (Lorenz, H., et. al, Journal of the University of Chemical Technology and Metallurgy (2007) 42(1): 5-16).<br>
Preferably the desired enantiomer which is obtained by any one of the processes according to the first, second, third, fourth, sixth, seventh, eighth and tenth aspects of the invention does not comprise any detectable amount of an undesired isomer.<br>
Deprotection<br>
Having coupled benzoyl cytosine to BOMO, the final step of the synthesis is the removal of the benzoyl protecting groups to obtain the debenzoylated product, for example compound (17) as shown in Scheme 5.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Scheme 5: Debenzoylation reaction<br>
Suitable deprotection methods include: catalytic NaOMe / MeOH, Methanolic Ammonia, and Aqueous Ammonia in Methanol.<br>
The sodium methoxide mediated hydrolysis was investigated first. This method deprotects quantitatively, however requires an aqueous workup to get rid of the salts non-chromatographically. Therefore as the final products, such as compound (17), may possess some water solubility, the workup reduces the yield. The methanolic ammonia method was also investigated. Methanolic ammonia again cleanly deprotected the molecule after overnight stirring, and after removal of the solvent, slurrying in acetone removed the more lipophilic by-products and yielded the product very cleanly. The reaction was equally successful whether the starting material were RR or SS (Table 14, experiments 2, 3, 4). Alternatively, it was found that aqueous ammonia in methanol could also be used. Deprotection using this method is slower but is clean however this involves the removal of water and thus is less convenient in larger scale than methanolic ammonia.<br>

To a stirred mixture of 2-R-Benzoyloxymethyl-l,3-oxathiolane (118g, 0.526 mol) and glacial acetic acid (47g, 0.790 mol) in a 500mL RB flask fitted with an air/water condenser, at 40°C, was added hydrogen peroxide (35% in water) (65 mL, 0.736 mol) in 4 portions at approximately 10 minute intervals. The initial additions are very exothermic. This was stirred at this temperature for 1 hour and at room temperature for lhour. The mixture was then transferred to a 1 L beaker and was diluted with dichloromethane (500mL). While stirring, a solution of 10% sodium sulfite in water (500 mL) was added in<br>
small portions (initially vigorous reaction). The organic layer was separated and this was next stirred with an aqueous saturated sodium carbonate solution (500mL) till there was no bubbling. The organic layer was separated, washed with brine and dried with magnesium sulfate. The resulting hazy colorless solution was filtered through celite to obtain a clear solution. This was evaporated to give the product as colorless viscous oil, which solidified to a white solid. This material was used for the next step in the synthesis without further purification. This material is a mixture of E / Z diastereomers of the ratio 2.4:1 (via NMR). Yield: 114g(90%)<br>

To this triethylamine (9.6 mL, 0.069 mol, 1.1 equivalent) was added. This was followed by the dropwise addition of iodotrimethylsilane (18.7 mL, 0.131 mol, 2.1 equivalents) via a dropping funnel, at a rate such that the internal temperature remained below -40°C.

Each sample came from a reaction where the starting ratio for the BOMO was 97(R) / 3(S) (The R/S ratio of the crude was not done for these samples) .The crude was recrystalhzed by dissolving while refluxing in 14 volumes of methanol. For entrainment 14 mg seeds (pure R,R) per gram of crude were used. Seeding was done at a temperature between 55°C and 56°C. After the specified time, the crystals were filtered, washed with methanol, dried, and analyzed with HPLC. The results are shown in the following table.<br>

Effect of Stirring and Seeding<br>
Each sample came from a reaction where the starting ratio for the BOMO was 82 (R) / 18 (S). The crude was recrystallized by dissolving while refluxing in 14 volumes of methanol. Next this is allowed to cool with stirring (at the specified rate) or without stirring, while monitoring the temperature. At the temperature of 55°C, the stirred mixture is seeded with Pure 'R,R' isomer or not seeded and stirred overnight while allowing the temperature to come to room temperature. The crystallized mixture is then filtered, washed with methanol and analyzed via HPLC. The results are shown in the following table.<br>

Next this is allowed to cool with stirring (at lOOOrpm) or without stirring, while monitoring the temperature. At the specified temperature of 55°C, the stirred mixture was seeded with Pure 'R,R' isomer stirred overnight while allowing the temperature to come to room temperature. The crystallized mixture is then filtered, washed with methanol and analyzed via HPLC. The results are shown in the following table.<br>

Note: This set of recrystallizations were done on the same crude mixture used for Table 16, coming from a reaction where the starting BOMO R/S ratio was 80/20 (actual R/S ratio: 82:18).

Recrystallization in mixed solvent systems<br>
All recrystallizations were seeded at 53°C, 14mg of seed /g crude, stirred at 1000 rpm, with xl4 volumes of solvent. Recrystallizations were done on a crude mixture coming from a reaction where the starting BOMO R/S ratio was 82:18. HPLC analysis of crude gave an approximate crude R/S ratio of 86 /14. As previously discussed, when R/S ratio decreases, specially below 90: 10, there is a propensity for trans isomer to also crystallize (Table 11). Thus In this set of experiments, we did see the trans isomer uniformly about 10-12%. Therefore the observed RR/SS ratio was corrected for the presence of RR and SS trans isomers. The results are shown in the following table.<br>
