				<td> <br><br>
The present invention generally relates to ophthalmic lens design and more specifically relates to junctionless ophthalmic lenses and methods for manufacturing ophthalmic lenses having junctionless, three dimensional surfaces.<br>
Contact lens design typically involves a number of steps. The back surface, i.e. posterior surface, of the lens is frequently designed first based on the shape of the cornea and a desired cornea-lens fitting relationship. The front surface, i.e. anterior surface, of the lens is constructed to obtain the necessary refractive correction for the eye and the desired lens performance. Such performance depends on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, lens mass distribution to provide effective eyelid interaction to achieve desired lens movement and lens position, other configurational considerations to provide for the comfort of the lens wearer and the like.<br>
It is known that the surface topographies of a normal human cornea are often not spherical. For example, it is well known that the corneal surface of an eye has a curve that generally flattens from the center of the cornea to the periphery. A typical approach to create a flatter peripheral lens surface and adequate edge clearance between the edge of the lens and the underlying cornea/conjunctiva, has been to generate a series of conic section curves, each having a radius of curvature larger (i.e. flatter) than the preceding one. Both the anterior and posterior surfaces of conventional contact lens designs have been described in two dimensions by a series of rotationally symmetric surface segments. The surface segments may or may not be offset from the axis of symmetry.<br>
Conventionally designed lenses have been therefor described in two dimensions,  such as by a series of<br><br>
rotationally symmetric surface segments, and may be mathematically described thereby. The mathematical descriptions of two dimensional surface sections are made smooth and continuous by compositing, for example, splines or polynomials or blending of the sections. Such smooth, continuous surfaces can be considered to be free of junctions, or junctionless. Thus, ophthalmic lens surfaces with junctions have segments which intersect at discontinuities which can cause discomfort and/or one or more other reductions in lens performance. Thus, it is advantageous to provide an ophthalmic lens with one or more substantially junctionless surfaces.<br>
Ducharme U.S. Patent No. 5,452,031, which is incorporated in its entirety herein by reference, discloses a contact lens and method for manufacturing a contact lens having a smooth, junctionless surface. More specifically, the Ducharme patent discloses a method for defining the shape of the contact lens surface by relating the corneal surface to a reference curve. The reference curve may be derived from the use of piecewise polynomials and splines, based on point coordinates, resulting in a junctionless surface topography. A computer controlled lathe receives the spline data and generates a signal indicating the necessary lens form to be cut.<br>
Vayntraub U.S. Patent No. 5,815,237 which is incorporated in its entirety herein by reference, discloses a method for making a contact lens having a peripheral zone surface defined by an exponential function. Similarly, Vayntraub U.S. Patent No. 5,815,236 and also incorporated in its entirety herein by reference, discloses a method for making a contact lens having a peripheral zone surface defined by a logarithmic function.<br>
Although more closely approximating the curvature of a human eye than earlier spherically based contact lens forms, these now conventional lens computer aided design<br><br>
methods, which are based on using polynomial and spline based interpolations, or exponential and logarithmic mathematical functions, result in a lens constrained to a two dimensional description of the surface topography.<br>
The surface topography of a normal human cornea is often unique and includes areas of irregularity, asymmetry and asphericity that can not adequately be described in two dimensions. Likewise the lens anterior or posterior lens surface shape required to achieve optimal lens performance cannot be adequately described in two dimensions. Particularly in such cases, conventional two dimensional computer aided lens design methods are insufficient.<br>
Designing a lens in two dimensions is inadequate when one or more of the posterior or anterior surfaces involves an asymmetric component, that is a rotationally asymmetric component. Although computer controlled manufacturing techniques have facilitated manufacture of lenses in recent years, such techniques in practice have had only limited application and are inadequate in design and production of lenses having one or more asymmetric components, particularly lenses for use in or on an eye, such as contact lenses, intraocular lenses and corneal onlay lenses. This is because current art in lens design necessarily requires assumptions and compromises to the design by the averaging and compositing of many two dimensional surfaces. Such assumptions and compromises can result in reduced lens performance, both optically and based on user comfort.<br>
It would be advantageous to provide new ophthalmic lenses and methods of designing and producing ophthalmic lenses which address one or more of the concerns with prior lenses, lens designs and production methods.<br><br>
Suimnary of the Invention.<br>
New ophthalmic lenses and methods for ophthalmic lens design and manufacture have been discovered. The present lenses and methods offer significant advantages over conventional lenses and methods by providing ophthalmic lenses having substantially smooth, junctionless, three dimensional surfaces which may include one or more rotationally asymmetric components. Lenses produced by the methods in accordance with the invention may include, but are not limited to, ophthalmic lenses structured and adapted for use in or on an eye, for example, all types of contact lenses, such as toric contact lenses, monofocal and multifocal contact lenses and the like intraocular lenses (lOLs), such as anterior chamber lOLs, posterior chamber lOLs and the like, corneal onlay lenses, such as lenses affixed on the cornea, lenses placed or affixed in the cornea and the like. In addition, methods of the present invention may be utilized during corneal refractive laser surgery, for example in the shaping of the cornea.<br>
The present invention provides methods for designing and manufacturing ophthalmic lenses having one or more substantially smooth, junctionless, three dimensional surfaces, for example, wherein the surface or surfaces m.ay have one or more asymmetrical components. The scope of the present invention also includes such lenses, tooling inserts and mold sections used to manufacture such lenses, and methods of producing such tooling inserts and mold sections.<br>
Advantageously, the present invention provides one or more additional, for example, relative to the prior art, degrees of freedom to control lens shape, surface contour, distribution of mass, optical power location and the like parameters within the lens design.  Consequently, enhanced ophthalmic lens performance,  for example,  related to<br><br>
comfort,  fitting,  vision and/or lens positioning are provided by the present invention.<br>
It will be appreciated that the present methods are especially advantageous when applied to lens design where constraints of symmetry would otherwise present a disadvantage. For example, the methods are very well suited for the design of toric contact lenses, for example a toric contact lens including a posterior toric optical zone and an anterior surface shaped to provide the lens with appropriate optical power and a thickness profile facilitating lens orientation and stabilization in the form of a ballast.<br>
Moreover, the present invention provides for enhanced reproducibility of the ophthalmic lens dimensions and surfaces. The present invention very effectively complements modern CNC lathes which have been used to produce ophthalmic lenses.<br>
In one broad aspect of the present invention, methods for producing ophthalmic lenses are provided which generally comprise providing or specifying selected sample data points from a designated surface, for example, a designated corneal surface (the surface of the cornea of the wearer of the lens) or designated or desired anterior lens surface, interpolating between the sample data points using at least one algorithm to define a simulated three dimensional designated surface, preferably that has a relationship to, for example, is based at least in part on, the designated surface, and forming an ophthalmic lens having the simulated three dimensional designated surface. The simulated design surface preferably is sufficiently well defined, for example, in the interpolating step, to be a smooth, substantially junctionless three dimensional surface. In one embodiment, the simulated three dimensional surface is defined, during the interpolating step, using the sample data points and one or more factors<br><br>
or relationships for one or more lens design parameters. Advantageously, the forming step is conducted so that the ophthalmic lens has the desired lens design parameters including, but not limited to, the desired optical correction or corrections, size, configuration, space or gap between the cornea and posterior surface of the lens and other desired optical fitting relationships and the like.<br>
Advantageously, the methods of the present invention can be used to produce contact lenses having surfaces not constrained to contours defined by a two dimensional surface of rotation. Rather, the present lenses preferably are defined by one or more smooth, substantially junctionless, three dimensional surfaces, including any rotationally asymmetric components unique or customized to the v/earer's eye. This results in an improved lens/cornea fitting relationship and/or anterior surface shape that achieve desired physical, physiological lens movement and/or vision correction objectives.<br>
In one aspect of the invention, ophthalmic lenses are provided and comprise lens bodies, preferably structured and adapted to be located in or on an eye, having anterior surfaces and generally opposing posterior surfaces . At least one of the anterior surface and the posterior surface is a substantially smooth, junctionless, three dimensional surface. The junctionless surface may be an asymmetrical surface.<br>
Although, for illustrative purposes, the description of the present invention set forth herein emphasizes contact lenses and methods relating to contact lenses, it is to be understood that the present invention is adapted to ophthalmic lenses in general, and preferably to ophthalmic lenses structured and adapted to be located in or on an eye, and to methods relating to such ophthalmic lenses.  All such lenses and methods are included within<br><br>
the scope of the present invention.<br>
The present invention may be adapted for use in producing ophthalmic lenses using any suitable processing technique or combination thereof. In one useful embodiment, the present invention is utilized in conjunction with conventional cast molding techniques, for example in the initial design of a tooling insert having a surface generally corresponding to a desired lens surface. As is well known to those skilled in the art, a tooling insert, or tool, is used to form a mold section which generally defines a negative impression of a surface of a final lens product.<br>
For example, a tooling insert having a three dimensional, substantially junctionless surface designed by a method of the invention, is positioned in a molding apparatus, such as a molding apparatus of conventional design. A moldable composition, such as a polymeric material or a composition of a polymeric material, is introduced into the molding apparatus and subjected to conditions effective to form a mold section having a negative impression of the surface of the tool. The mold section formed by the tool may be either a back surface mold section, or a front surface mold section depending upon the tooling insert design. In other words, the surface of the tool generally corresponds to a face, either a posterior or an anterior face of the ophthalmic lens to be formed.<br>
As is conventional, the mold section is assembled with a complementary mold section to form a lens-shaped cavity therebetween. A contact lens precursor material is introduced into the lens-shaped cavity. Upon demolding or removal from the mold sections, a lens product is obtained. As is typical, post formation processing steps may be employed to the demolded contact lens product. These steps may include hydration, sterilization, packaging and the<br><br>
like.  These steps are well known and are not considered part of the present invention.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, the tooling insert may include irregular or asymmetric surface contours that are customized or unique to the wearer's eye, or contours which are not definable as a substantially junctionless surface by a two dimensional curve or interpolation. The design of the tooling insert preferably is accomplished by a method comprising providing or specifying sample data points from a designated, three dimensional surface, for example, a designated corneal surface or a designated or desired anterior lens surface, interpolating between the data points using at least one algorithm to define a simulated three dimensional designated surface, and forming the simulated three dimensional surface on the tooling insert, for example, on a tooling insert blank.<br>
In this embodiment of the invention, cast molded ophthalmic lenses, for example, contact lenses, are made having improved fit, and/or anterior surface shape and/or vision correction performance and/or other performance relative to conventional or prior art cast molded lenses, for example, that are conventionally produced using symmetric, conic or spherical inserts.<br>
Alternative lens manufacturing techniques may be used in conjunction with the methods of the present invention. For example, the algorithm may be used in conjunction with lens surface forming tools, including but not limited to lathes or mills. The simulated designated three dimensional surface can be cut directly onto a lens blank, for example, using a computer driven surface cutting tool.<br>
In another aspect of the present invention, methods for reshaping corneas are provided. Such methods comprise providing or specifying sample data points from a three dimensional corrected corneal surface, that is a corneal<br><br>
surface to be provided to the cornea of a patient to obtain a desired result, such as a desired vision correction; interpolating between the sample data points using at least one algorithm to produce a smooth, substantially junctionless, simulated three dimensional surface; and providing an optical correction to a cornea by shaping the surface of the cornea to approximate the simulated three dimensional surface. In one useful embodiment, the methods further comprise providing sample data points from a three dimensional surface of the uncorrected surface of the cornea of the patient; and interpolating between the sample data points using at least one algorithm to produce a smooth, substantially junctionless, simulated three dimensional uncorrected surface, which is then employed in the providing step.<br>
The present methods are effective to determine what degree of corneal reshaping is required to achieve a desired vision correction. The simulated three dimensional corrected corneal surface is the surface which will provide the desired correction, for example, vision correction. The uncorrected surface that is interpolated from the sample data points of the uncorrected cornea represents the surface of the cornea prior to reshaping. Thus, the degree of reshaping required to go from the original, uncorrected shape of the cornea to the desired or corrected shape of the cornea for a desired correction is determined.<br>
The reshaping itself can be performed using any suitable method which can be adapted to be controlled in accordance with the present invention. In one particularly useful embodiment, the step of providing a correction includes ablating the surface of the cornea using a com.puter-driven laser system, such as is conventionally used in reshaping corneal surfaces. The step of providing a correction may include producing an asymmetrical surface on a corneal surface, for example, on a symmetrical corneal<br><br>
surface.<br>
Each and every feature described herein, and each and every combination of two or more of such features, is included within the scope of the present invention provided that the features included in such a combination are not mutually inconsistent.<br>

Detailed Description of the Drawings<br>
The present invention is directed to ophthalmic lenses and methods for designing and producing such lenses, including but not limited to monofocal, multifocal and toric contact lenses, intraocular lenses, corneal inlay lenses and other ophthalmic lenses.<br>
For the sake of simplicity and illustrative clarity, the following detailed description will be directed primarily to the design of contact lenses. It will be appreciated by persons of ordinary skill in the art that the methods in accordance with the invention, possibly with one or more appropriate modifications thereto, can be utilized in the design of these and other types of lenses .<br>
In accordance with a method of the invention, an<br>
I-?<br><br>
ophthalmic lens is designed using a mathematical algorithm and a limited number of specifications to achieve a single, continuous, non-compositing mathematical surface in three dimensional space.<br>
More particularly, after a corneal shape is determined for a population or a selected patient, a posterior surface of a contact lens is designed by interpolating between sample scattered data points using a mathematical algorithm, preferably including relationships directed to one or more parameters desired for the resulting lens to have, for example, the space or gap between the cornea and the posterior surface of the lens, as described elsewhere herein, to produce a simulated three dimensional surface (posterior lens surface) , for example, that is based at least in part on the corneal shape, such as closely approximating one or more of the varying curvatures of the cornea. Thickness data as well as specifications or relationships or for one or more lens performance requirements or parameters, as described elsewhere herein, are provided and, in conjunction with the selected mathematical algorithm, define a three dimensional surface (anterior lens surface) having a desired thickness profile.<br>
The simulated three dimensional surfaces can be formed onto a lens using conventional manufacturing techniques, for example by cast molding techniques. Moreover, the present invention complements the use of modern CNC lathes.<br>
By using this approach as detailed herein, anterior and/or posterior lens surfaces can be designed, preferably without substantial compromise.<br>
Referring now to Fig. 1, a simplified, vertical cross sectional view of a contact lens 10 and cornea 12 is shown, taken across x and z coordinate axes, with the y-axis being directed into the page. The lens 10 includes a back surface (i.e. posterior surface) 14, that is tangential to the X and y axes at (0,0,0) . The cornea 12 lies a distance<br>
I<br><br>
a mm below a center of the back surface 14 of the lens lo, and a front surface {i.e. anterior surface) 18 lies a distance 5 mm above the cornea 12. The cornea has a surface 22 that is ellipsoidal with semi-axial lengths RQ and i?i, as further described herein.<br>
Any contact lens can be designed using the present invention.<br>
For example, turning now to Figs 2a-2c, a rotationally symmetric, single vision contact lens 30 is shown, to represent one of the most simplest contact lens designs.<br>
The present invention is particularly advantageous in the design and production of more complex, rotationally asymmetric lenses.  For example, Figs. 3a-3c show a toric contact lens 40, specifically a prism ballast toric lens, designed in accordance with the invention.<br>
Figs. 4a-4c show a very complex lens design, produced in accordance with the present invention. This complex lens 50 includes asymmetrical three dimensional surface components that can not be satisfactorily designed using conventional two dimensional methods and techniques.<br>
Lens design using the present invention more specifically comprises the following steps. A corneal shape of a patient is first determined. A selected number of sample data points representing the cornea are provided using conventional means. A desired fitting relationship of the lens back surface to the cornea is then specified to meet the wearer's physiological, physical and/or optical requirements. A simulated three dimensional surface is then defined using an algorithm to interpolate between the data points. This simulated three dimensional surface can be formed on a tooling insert, or directly onto a lens posterior surface, for example by using a computer driven surface cutting tools, mills or lathes.<br>
Next, an anterior surface of the lens is designed.<br><br>
Particularly, key lens thickness data points are specified to achieve the desired clinical performance, e.g. vision correction, rotational orientation of a toric lens and the like. Examples of such thickness data for the three lens types are shown in Figs 2a-2b, Figs. 3a-3b, and Fig 4. The anterior surface of the lens is now designed by using an algorithm in conjunction with the key lens thickness data.<br>
The outcomes of the construction of posterior and anterior surfaces, in accordance with a method of the invention, of the three lens types are demonstrated by the three dimensional schematic representations in Figs. 5a -7b. More specifically. Figs 5a, 6a and 7a show rear surface/cornea separation of the three lens types, and Figs. 5b, 6b and 7b show radial thickness profiles of the three lens types.<br>
Turning now specifically to Figs. 7a and 7b, the complex lens design 50 is shown as smooth and substantially junctionless, despite the varied surface topography thereof. Those of skill in the art will appreciate that this complex lens design cannot be produced using conventional two dimensional mathematically based lens design techniques and methods. It is further noted that the contours of the lens surface shown in Fig 7b can not be produced using offset rotationally symmetric curves and other sophisticated current design methods.<br>
The step of providing sample data points may be accomplished using conventional techniques and equipment in which sample data points, for example, sagittal depths, can be designated, supplied or selected, for representing the designated surface.<br>
As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, the task of mathematically representing a surface smoothly in three dimensions, given a limited number of scattered data points and specifications, can be accomplished by many methods   and   for  particular   shapes   and   design<br><br>
specifications. It is known that one algorithm may provide a better description than another, for example by providing different degrees of accuracy. The present invention can be exemplified by three algorithms, which follow hereinafter, although it is recognized that the present invention is not limited to any particular algorithms or combinatioiis of algorithms.<br>
The step of forming the lens surface having the three dimensional contour may include shaping a lens using a computer driven mill or lathe or other suitable cutting tool. The simulated three dimensional surface may be inputted in digital form into a computer driven lathe, and the lathe programed to cut the junctionless, three dimensional surface into a lens blank, a tooling insert (for example in cast molded lenses) , or a cornea (for example during laser surgery).<br>
The central portion of an ophthalmic lens is typically referred to as the "optical zone" of the lens in that it provides the optical correction. Depending on the wearer, the optical zone may be described by a spherical conic section, or it may be another, more complicated configuration, such as a toric optical zone. The present invention is especially advantageous in design of toric contact lenses, as well as even more complex designs.<br>
Contact lenses having a toric optical zone (commonly referred to as "toric contact lenses") are commonly used to correct refractive abnormalities of the eye relating to astigmatism. Astigmatism may be associated with other refractive abnormalities, such as myopia (nearsightedness), and hypermetropia (farsightedness), presbyopia and the like. Toric contact lenses can be prescribed with one or more spherical corrections.<br>
Whereas spherical contact lenses may freely rotate on the eye, toric contact lenses typically include a ballast, or a thickened lens section, to inhibit rotation of the<br><br>
lens on the eye such that the cylindrical axis of the toric zone remains generally aligned with the axis of the astigmatism. The ballast provides an asymmetric component to the lens that can be addressed by the present invention.<br>
With particular reference to Fig. 8, the present invention further includes tools or tooling inserts 112 and 113 useful for cast molding a posterior surface and an anterior surface, respectively, of an ophthalmic lens. The tooling inserts 112 and 113 are adapted to be placed in molding apparatus 115 and 116 in forming a first mold section or half 117 and a second mold section or half 118, each having a negative impression of a surface of the respective tooling insert. The surfaces of the inserts 112 and 113 are substantially smooth, junctionless three dimensional asymmetrical surfaces corresponding to a desired ophthalmic lens posterior surface and anterior surface, respectively. The mold sections or halves 117 and 118 are assembled together to form an assembled mold 120, which defines a lens-shaped cavity. A polytnerizable/curable monomer composition is placed in the cavity and is processed, e.g., polymerized and/or cured, to form a contact lens. Such processing may be conventional and well known in the art and, therefore, needs not be described in detail. The lens is demolded and may be subjected to conventional additional processing steps, such as sterilization, packaging and the like.<br>
Tool inserts and molding sections produced by such tool inserts, as described herein, are within the scope of the present invention.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, a method for reshaping the cornea of an eye is provided. The method generally comprises selecting or designating sample data points representing a corrected corneal surface of an eye of a patient, e.g., human being, and interpolating, using at least one algorithm, between the sample data points, to<br><br>
produce a substantially smooth, continuous, three dimensional surface. Preferably, sample data points from a three dimensional surface of the uncorrected surface of the patient's cornea are obtained and are interpolated between using at least one algorithm to produce a smooth, substantially junctionless simulated three dimensional uncorrected surface. Using a conventional computer driven laser system supplied with the simulated surface contour, and preferably the simulated uncorrected surface contour, the cornea is reshaped to approximate the simulated surface contour. In this embodiment of the invention, the method can be used with conventional corneal refractive laser surgical systems to alter the refractive capabilities of the eye by selectively ablating or reshaping the corneal stromal tissue, and in some cases, following temporary removal of an anterior corneal flap. The method is useful in producing an asymmetric surface, such as a corneal surface, for example, to correct astigmatism, in providing custom corneal shaping for improved optical correction, in providing a correction centered over the corneal apex which is often not aligned with the pupil center and the like.<br>

where h^ is the ith data point, {Xi, yj its position, and N is the number of data points.<br>
II.  THE INTERPOLATION METHOD (Cline and Renka, 1984)<br>
The following is a summary description of the interpolation method hereinafter referred to as the CR scheme; this method is described more fully in, Cline A.K. and Renka, R.J., "A Storage-efficient Method for Construction of A Thiessen Triangulation", Rocky Mountain J. Math. 14(1), 119-139 (1984); Renka, R.J. and Cline, A.K., "A Triangle-based C^ Interpolation Method", Rocky Mountain J. Math. 14(1) 223-237 (1984); and Renda R.J., "Algorithm 624: Triangulation and Interpolation At Arbitrarily Distributed Points In The Plane"; ACM Trans. Math, Software 10(4) 440-442 (1984). Each of these Publications is incorporated in its entirety herein by reference.<br>
The CR scheme comprises the following steps:<br>
a. Partition the convex hull associated with the set of known data points { (x,, y^) , . , . (x^, yn) ) into triangles (CR Step 1).<br><br>
b.	Estimate the partial derivatives of the<br>
interpolating function f (K,y) at each data point (CR Step<br>
2) .<br>
c.	For any arbitrary point (Xo,yo) in the convex<br>
hull, the value of the interpolating function f (Xo^Yo) can<br>
then be calculated using the data values and partial)<br>
derivatives at each of the vertices of the triangle<br>
containing (xo,yo) . The calculation is based on a cubic<br>
surface capping the triangle (CR Step 3).<br>
STEP 1.  Triangulation.<br>
Let S be the set of nodes (data points) { (Xi, yj,...(x„, yj}, where n2:3 and (x^, Y^)*(X^, y^) for i * j. Wi is used to denote the node(Xi, yj . Let H be the convex hull of S.<br>
A triangulation of S is a set of triangles T with the following properties: (i) each triangle contains exactly three nodes, (ii) the interior regions of the triangles are pairwise disjoint, and (iii) every point in H is contained in some triangle of T.<br>
To maximize the accuracy of Steps (ii) and (iii) above, construct a triangle that is as nearly equiangular as possible. To do this, define an arc as the undirected line segment N^ *=&gt; Nj, i * j, joining two vertices of a triangle in T. An arc W, « N^ is locally optimal if it lies on the boundary of H or if the quadrilateral defined by a pair of adjacent triangles that share nodes is not strictly convex.<br>
The triangulation required is one in which all arcs are locally optical. The resulting triangulation is called a Thiessen triangulation, or a Delaunay triangulation. Cline and Renka (1984) give the following algorithm for<br><br>
producing a Thiessen triangulation.<br>
» For each node N^, define the Thiessen region associated with N^ to be the set of points (x,y) which satisfy | (x,y) - N^ | (x,y) - Nj | for all i/j.<br>
•	A pair of nodes Nj, N^ are said to be Thiessen<br>
neighbours iff their corresponding Thiessen<br>
regions share at least one point. If the<br>
regions share exactly one point, Nj and N^ are<br>
called weak Thiessen neighbours, if they share<br>
two or more points, they are called strong<br>
Thiessen neighbours.<br>
•	Connect all pairs of strong Thiessen neighbours,<br>
and arbitrarily choose k - 3 nonintersecting<br>
arcs connecting weak neighbours when k nodes lie<br>
on a common circle (k^4).<br>
STEP  2.    Estimate  partial  derivatives  of  the<br>
interpolating function f(x,y) at each data point.<br>
After performing the triangulation, the next step in the CR scheme is to determine the partial derivatives of the interpolating functions at each node.<br>
The value of the following partial derivative vectors are to be found:<br><br><br><br>
STEP 3.  Sampling.<br>
For any arbitrary point in the convex hull, the value of the interpolating function can be calculated using the data values and partial derivatives at each of the vertices of the triangle containing the arbitrary point. The calculation is based on a cubic surface capping the triangle.<br>
The previous two steps have constructed the skeleton of the interpolating function at the known data points of the surface.  In the absence of an elementary formula for<br><br>
the underlying surface, the matheraatical description of the surface will be complete when the algorithm representing /(x,y) returns a reasonable value for any (X/y) = (Ko^yg)±n the region of interest.<br>
This process is a common one in interpolation and finite-element analysis, and therefor will not be described in detail herein. In summary, the value of f(Xi,,yo) for some fxo^yo) = H is calculated by a procedure due to Lawson (1976). On the triangle T containing (Xo^yo), the local structure of f is represented by the cubic element F (x,y) spanning the triangle, so that f (Xg,yg} = F {Xo,yo) • The local element F  has the following properties:<br>
1.	F is a true cubic (not bicubic) in each of the three subtriangles of equal area formed by connecting the vertices to the barycenter of the triangle containing (Xo^yo) .<br>
2.	F is C^<br>
3.	On each triangle edge, iV^ *=» W^, F is a<br>
Hermite cube interpolate of z^ , z^ and their<br>
directional derivatives at the endpoints W^ and<br>
Wj.. Furthermore, the derivative of F in the<br>
direction normal to Wj «=» Nj interpolates the<br>
normal derivative at W^ and  iVj_ .<br>
The last two properties guarantee the C^ continuity across triangle borders (and hence over the whole region E) , since the derivatives at any point on a triangle side are completely determined by their values at the endpoints of the side.<br><br>
With the construction of local cubic elements	F,<br>
values lying between the local known data points can	be<br>
determined.  The surface is thus knowable at any point	in<br>
the region covered by the data.<br>
III.   INTERPOLATION METHOD (THE BICUBIC SPLINE)<br>
This interpolation method, described in Dierck, P., "<br>
An Algorithm for Surface Fitting With Spline Functions",<br>
IMA Journal of Numerical Analysis, v.l, pp. 267-283 (1981),<br>
calculates a smooth, bicubic spline approximation cp (Xfy)<br>
to the set of scattered data points CXj, y^, hj) weights iVj,<br>
where i = 1...N.	The spline is given the B-spline<br>
representation<br><br><br>
is then calculated. If 9 is greater than a user-specified non-negative limit 5, the knot set is refined by adding extra knots in regions where the fit is most poor (that is, where 9 is largest) to produce the knot set for the {k + 1) th iteration. After many such iterations, the criterion 0 ^ S is satisfied, the set of knots is accepted.<br>
The above-noted publication by P. Kierck is hereby incorporated in its entirety herein by reference.<br>
The final approximation to the surface is then calculated as the solution to the optimization problem of finding the coefficients in equation (4) that minimizes a global smoothness measure subject to the constraint 9
