THE PATENTS ACT, 1970 (39 of 1970)<br>
COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
(See Section 10)<br>
RECIPROCATING WASHING MACHINE<br>
HINDUSTAN LEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office at Hindustan Lever House, 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai -400 020, Maharashtra, India<br>
The following specification  particularly describes the  nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br>
ORIGIANL<br>
242/MUMNP/2001<br>
13/MARCH/2001<br><br>
GRANTED<br>
11-3-2002<br><br>
Technical Field:<br>
The invention relates to a reciprocating washing machine. More particularly, the invention relates to a variable amplitude reciprocating washing machine that can be mounted either horizontally or vertically.<br>
Background and Prior Art:<br>
Washing of fabric is generally carried out either by hand washing or by machine washing, using water in presence of a detergent.<br>
Conventionally fabric is cleaned using water and a detergent surfactant system which is known as wet washing. Surfactants adsorb on both fabric and soil, thereby reducing the respective interfacial energies, facilitating removal of soil from the fabric. Alternatively it is done by a process called dry cleaning where organic solvents such as perchloroethylene (PCE), petroleum based or Stoddard solvents, CFC-113 and 1,1,1-trichloroethane are used, all of which are generally aided by a surfactant. The organic solvent helps in removal of oily soil in the presence of detergents. Soil removal can be achieved by a small reduction in interfacial tension. The particulate soil is largely removed by providing agitation.<br>
Washing machines are almost always of a rotary type that may have the provision for loading the fabric from the front or top. The front loading washing machines clean using the tumbling action that is unable to produce high mechanical action.<br><br><br>
However, this mechanical action is greater than the top loading machines. To clean heavily soiled garments high mechanical action is essential.<br>
1<br>
W09521954 discloses a reciprocating washing machine wherein the shape and the movement of the washing vessel is restricted to the guide provided. The movement is essentially vertical and is dependent on the mass of the wash load and makes it necessary to have the mass uniform in order to achieve controlled reciprocation. The amplitude of motion is essentially fixed. It is essential to have the balancing means for absorbing the unbalanced forces created by the motion. Since the reciprocation is on a vertical axis the system experiences differences in the upward and downward strokes. It will be very difficult to mount this machine horizontally and obtain the desired results.<br>
In our copending application (469/Mum/2000) it has been found that efficient removal of both soluble and insoluble soils may be achieved by the cleaning of fabric using the liquid-liquid interface of at least two immiscible liquid phases with an interfacial tension greater than 10mN/m, under agitation. It is also found that superior cleaning may be achieved economically by the use of water as a major component along with organic solvent with the use of little or no surfactant.<br>
The applicants have found that the disadvantages of rotary type and the known reciprocating type machines can be solved by the use of a variable amplitude reciprocating washing machine that can be mounted either horizontally or vertically.<br><br><br>
The benefit of making it horizontal is that one does not need balancing means and shock absorbing mechanism which is essential if the wash vessel is moving up and down. By eliminating the guide for the wash vessel it is possible to have varied shapes of the washing vessel. In this machine the mass of the wash load is not a criteria for the motion and hence it can also be suitably varied.<br>
Thus the present invention relates to reciprocating washing machine comprising :<br>
(i)       reciprocating means capable of reciprocating movement;<br>
(ii) a wash vessel connected to the reciprocating means and capable of movement in co-ordination with the reciprocating means wherein reciprocating means is provided with means for restricting the reciprocating movement to a predetermined number of degrees of freedom; and<br>
(iii) means to vary the amplitude of the reciprocating movement.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment the reciprocating washing machine is provided with a frequency controller acting in conjunction with the means capable of converting the rotary movement into reciprocating movement.<br>
The frequency controller is provided with a prime mover which is a device capable of delivering a drive of the desired power and can be selected from any one of an electrical motor, induction motor, petrol engine<br><br><br>
or any other device known in the art. It is preferred that the prime mover is electrically operated and is provided with a frequency controller. The frequency control may be achieved by using an electrically or mechanically operated means.<br>
The prime mover is attached to a means capable of converting rotary movement into a reciprocating movement comprising a crank device with a rotatably installed crank shaft that is connected to a piston rod which in turn is connected at the other end detachably to the wash vessel. Guides such as bearings, plain guides, flat guides, dove tail guides etc are provided on the piston rod constraining and/or directing the movement of the piston rod in preferably one direction.<br>
The amplitude of the reciprocating member can be made variable by suitably elongating or reducing the effective length of the cranking arm.<br>
The washing vessel is detachably coupled to the piston rod and may be designed to have any suitable geometric shape for e.g. cylindrical, spherical, cuboid or conical. The mouth of the washing vessel is provided preferably with a leak proof sealed door. A solvent proof gasket and a handle for locking are preferable requirements. The door is sized to facilitate introduction and removal of garments. The vessel is further fitted with tubes that allow inlet and outlet of liquids.<br>
It is preferred that the washing machine reciprocates on a horizontal axis.<br><br>
The reciprocating washing machine of the present invention is particularly suitable for washing fabric using a system of immiscible liquids with high interfacial tension without the need to use additional detergency benefit agents. The machine is capable of handling flammable and/or hazardous solvents with minimal risk.<br>
The invention will now be illustrated with reference specific non-limiting embodiments, shown in the accompanying drawings in which<br>
Fig 1. Is the side view of the design of the horizontal reciprocating washing<br>
machine<br>
Fig 2  is the top view.<br>
Fig 1 shows the side view of the machine control panel that has a power on switch (1), frequency control drive (2) and another switch to regulate the liquid pumps . The liquid pumps (10) are connected to the wash vessel (9) by means of inlet (11) and outlet (12) pipes. The control panel is electrically connected to a foot mounted flange type AC induction motor (3). A crankwheel (5) is bolted on to the 'L' bracket (4). The diameter of the crankwheel depends on the desired amplitude of the reciprocating motion. A connecting rod (14) is attached to one end of the crankwheel using a rotary pin (15). The other end of the connecting rod is connected to the piston rod (6) by means of a ball joint (13) which is further supported with the help of two cylindrical linear bearings (7). The other end of the piston is threaded and forms the female end of the coupling (8). The wash vessel<br><br>
