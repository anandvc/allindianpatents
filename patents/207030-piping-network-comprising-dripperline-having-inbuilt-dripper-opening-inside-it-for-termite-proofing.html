The following specification particularly describes and ascertains the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br>
1<br>
2 8 SEP 2004<br><br>
The present invention relates to piping network comprising dripperline having inbuilt dripper (opening) inside it for termite proofing.<br>
Pests are controlled by various treatment. Treatment jobs include pre construction/post construction anti termite treatment, rodent control, general disinfestations, birds control, weeds control, lizard control &amp; all types of reptile control, fumigation, fogging, removal of honey-bee combs etc.<br>
Currently pest problem is a major problem for builders. Builders are fade up with frequent anti termite treatment to prevent the intrusion of pest into the building &amp; its neighboring premises. The intrusion of termites to the building can be restricted by using various effective anti termite treatment.<br>
STATE OF THE ART:<br>
In the present scenario home owners are much worried about the<br>
frequent anti termite treatment to the building. Frequent treatment using pesticides (termiticide) to the building, damages the existing structure.<br>
In the conventional method of anti termite treatment for pre-construction, pesticides is spread in two stages before flooring takes place as a chemical barrier. First, in the foundation pit before feeling it; and second, just before flooring.   Building is allowed to construct after few days, to let the<br>
pesticide mix properly with in the soil. If after construction, pest problem re-<br>
2<br><br>
appears in the building premises then re-treatment is to be done to the building structure. During re-treatment, pesticide is pumped at the plinth level of the building by making holes in the floor by drilling. The holes are at approximately 1 feet distant. The pesticide is pumped in the holes &amp; the holes are then sealed with cement. It is required to do patching the holes immediately after inserting pesticides, to prevent the degeneration of pesticides. When pesticides are more exposed to air/sun, it results into degeneration of pesticides.<br>
In the conventional method the cycle of anti termite treatment is applied for nearly every 5 years, depends on the kind of pesticide used. The termite does not grow/enter in the building/structure as long as there is a residue of pesticides in the soil under the floor. Once the effect of pesticides become weak, termite play a dominant role in damaging the structure of the building.<br>
In above said traditional method, treatment or re-treatment would disrupt the building by drilling and injecting termiticide through the slab, including any tiles, slates (a small piece of this used as a roof tile), marble etc. Frequent treatment may develop major/minor cracks in the wall as well as in the floor of the building. Frequent anti termite treatment causes many problems related to the structure of the building &amp; to certain extent it is also a costly affair.<br><br>
For the purpose of protecting the existing structure of the building from termite attack, one should pre plan it well before, about anti termite treatment. Pesticides are available in two main categories as under:-<br>
a.	Synthetic:    These are strong but non biodegradable<br>
b.	Natural:       These are not very strong but biodegradable<br>
Synthetic pesticides are made of big chain of molecules which does not degrade with the time. Synthetic pesticide is advantageous that it gives better shelf life, but it is also not preferable for use because it is not environment friendly. Moreover, manufacture of such pesticides is banned in many countries because it is non biodegradable and its manufacture involve air and water pollution.<br>
Natural pesticides are made from natural products, biodegradable, eco friendly but it is effective for short duration of time. Natural pesticides are required to be applied frequently in the soil because it is having comparatively smaller active life.<br>
Even though natural pesticide is having many advantages including its eco friendly nature, over its counterpart it is not in present use for termite treatment as it is having shorter shelf life. Because of its shorter shelf life, re-treatment required to be very frequent, which is inconvenient, expensive, and damages the structure of the building.<br>
4<br><br>
Pumping the pesticides/termiticide through the network of pipeline is the most suited option to over come the problem of the termites. Variety of pipes are used to meet the distribution need.<br>
THE FIELD OF INVENTION:<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a convenient and<br>
contemptible method of treatment and re-treatment for eradication of termites from the building.<br>
In the present invention, a network of pipeline is laid under the floor, through out the inner &amp; outer periphery of the building. Entire planning of laying the network of pipeline is to be considered alongwith the planning of the building. It will be very difficult to put a network of pipeline under the flooring for existing structures, thus this method has to be considered along with the planning of the building. The novel method can take care of any kind of foundation method employed. Pipeline for distribution of pesticide can be worked out as per the requirement. Piping network delivers a uniform and even distribution of pesticides(Termiticide) from one. end to another. The process is very convenient, less time taking, economical &amp; without damaging the existing structure of the building.<br>
For elimination of termites from the structure, anti termite treatment &amp; re-treatment is required to be done frequently as when required. The cycle of<br><br><br>
anti  termite treatment  has  to  be  continued  at  every  5  years.  Generally pesticides remain active for 4 to 5 years.<br>
In the present invention, holes are not made in the floor but a network of pipeline is placed under the floor before introducing the floor in the building foundation. Piping network is adjacent to the surrounding area of the building. This network is designed by taking into account the following factors.<br>
1.	Type of soil<br>
2.	Past history of site / type of the soil / field<br>
3.	site plan<br>
4.	proposed layout of wooden furniture of building (fixed/moveable)<br>
5.	Type of flooring.<br>
Observing all the above factors, the piping layout is designed for treatment and re-treatment. The pipeline used is. having inbuilt pressure drippers at distant of every 1 feet. A network of pipeline is extended throughout the building and protect all those places where even smallest chance of termite to enter. This network is not only adjacent to the inner perimeter of the building but also encircles the external perimeter of the building, which prevents attack of termites from the side walls i.e. neighboring premises. There is no inter-connection between the piping network used for inner  perimeter  of the  building  &amp;  external  perimeter  of the  building<br>
6<br><br>
foundation. Network is prepared as per the requirements of the building foundation.<br>
The   present   invention   is   described   herein   with   reference   to   th£ accompanying drawings:<br>
Fig.l Represents a sectional view of the building for termite elimination method. Fig. 2 Represents  the  arrangement  of piping  network  at  inner &amp;  outer<br>
perimeter of the building. Fig. 3 Represents a layout of dripperline with inbuilt dripper.<br>
Fig. 1 reveals the sectional view of the building. Which is surrounded by a piping network. Where all the periphery of the building structure \$ adjacent by a network of pipeline. Fig 1. shows both the inside and outside views of the building, where in observing the building at external periphery, Backfill 6 is in immediate contact with the Building Foundation 7.<br>
Fig. \ shows both trie side (outer &amp; inner ) of the huh ding structure.In the exterior periphery of the building, External Ground Level 10 is the Top layer of the Backfill 6. External perimeter 8 is the exterior region of the building, where anti termite treatment is executed through piping network. Piping network laid horizontally at external perimeter 8 is to avoid the termite attack from neighboring premises.<br>
7<br><br>
The present invention preferably involves, use of High Density Polyethylene (HDPE) pipe for piping network 13 &amp; 75. Inner and outer periphery of the building is covered by piping network 13 &amp; 75, anti termite treatment is executed through the piping network. Seamless one piece of pipe is used, which allows better flushing and higher operating pressure for longer runs over multiple seasons. Large turbulent flow path through a single piece of pipe ensures trouble free performance. High volume &amp; at medium pressure termiticide is injected in the piping network through the above ground removable closure pump 77. A dripperline is placed inside the piping network with inbuilt pressure dripper at the distant of 1 ft. Pumping the termiticide inside the piping network, higher pressure of termiticide will create a pressure at each dripper point &amp; it will break the pipeline at the point as a small aperture. From this dripper point termiticide infuses into the ground adjacent the building.<br>
In Fig 1 the left side of the building foundation 7 is the outer periphery of the building and the right side is inner periphery.<br>
Indoor building structure where, floor finish 7 is applied on the floor base 2 &amp; is the top layer of the inner ground level 12 of the building. Observing the inner periphery of the building, concrete sand 3 is feed below the floor base 2 and above the top surface of the plinth filling 4. Plinth level expand from indoor ground level 12 of the building to the Top surface of<br>
8<br><br>
plinth filling 4 of the building. Plinth filling 5 is the layer between the inner ground level 12 and Top surface of plinth filling 4.<br>
Junction 77 is connecting the foundation wall and &amp; floor finish 1. Section 9 shows horizontally the piping network (15 in Fig. 2) is laid to protect the indoor area of the building. This arrangement is advantageous to provide even distribution of termiticide to the critical areas &amp; also surrounding areas.<br>
This is also allow the external &amp; internal periphery of the building to be treated &amp; retreated quickly &amp; efficiently.<br>
Fig 2. description now follows the arrangement of piping network at inner &amp; outer periphery of the building.<br>
Inside the building; at the periphery, piping network 15 is placed in concrete sand bed 3 under the floor. At external periphery of the building; piping network 13 is placed beneath the external ground level 10 of the building. Termiticide is injected into both the external &amp; inner perimeter of the building by using piping network 13 and 15. Both the end of piping network of inner &amp; outer periphery is extended at above ground. At one end of the piping network, removable temporary closure pump 77 is attached to inject the termiticide. Closure pump 17 is to maintain a pressure in the piping network 13 8c 15. The other end of piping network 13 &amp; 75 is independently located above the ground at exterior of the building and a removable closure<br>
9<br><br>
cap 18 is for closing the end. There is no inter connection between piping network 13 and 15.<br>
Initially termiticide is injected into the external piping network 13 and after that closure pump 17 is removed from this end &amp; attach to the end of the inner piping network 15 for injecting termiticide. Thus individually termiticide is injected in piping network 13 &amp; 15 by using closure pump 17.<br>
Filter disc 16 of 3/4 inch is placed at the entrance of the piping network 13 &amp; 15 . It is fixed before injection of termiticide in the network. Filter 16 will allow to protect the flow from solid as per filtration rating. It gives simple, easy and thorough filter cleaning. Extra large filtration capacity will lead to less frequent cleaning. The flow of termiticide is evenly distributed through the piping network. The arrangement is highly integrated &amp; advantageous in many situations.<br>
Fig 3 reveals the structure of the dripperline with inbuilt special dripper placed in piping network (dripperline is fixed inside the pipeline during its manufacturing). 19 shows wall thickness of pipeline.<br>
Inbuilt dripper is constructed as a small hole in dripperline. Pesticide solution pass from the zig-zag line present on dripperline and come to the dripper. From dripper it passed to the soil. Inbuilt pressure dripper point 20 promotes precise &amp; uniform water delivery at each outer point.  Inbuilt<br>
10<br><br>
pressure dripper 20 provides unique flow of water, the highest reliability, precision and efficiency.<br>
After placing the piping network 13 &amp; 15 under the floor at inner and outer periphery of the building, both the end of pipeline are taken out at one place. Once the flooring 1 is complete, at any convenient time, the pesticides of high/medium dosage is pumped through the piping network 13 &amp; 15, by specially developed closure pump 17, The amount of pesticide used is as per the requirement of customers/standard. First of all termiticide is injected through the piping network 13 &amp; 15, then water is passed through piping network 13 &amp; 15 to flush the pipe and to ensure that full dosage is spread in the soil. Once delivery of pesticide &amp; water is completed, the end terminals of network 13 &amp; 15 are sealed by closure cap 18. The residue of pesticide in the soil will keep termites and many other pests away from the building. After every three years mild dose of pesticide is pumped to maintain the residue level of pesticides in the soil. Thus for remaining years anti termite treatment will be done without even pest control person entering into the building.<br>
Possibility of contamination of ground water with pesticide is less when pesticide is used in mild and in split dose than those of strong doses in less amount.<br>
