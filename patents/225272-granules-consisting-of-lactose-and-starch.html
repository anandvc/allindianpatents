				<td>GRANULES BASED ON STARCH AND LACTOSE<br>
The subject of the present invention is a<br>
composition of granules based on starch and lactose, as<br>
well as the process which makes it possible to obtain<br>
these granules.<br>
It also concerns the use of such granules in<br>
particular as excipient in the pharmaceutical industry<br>
or as additive or carrier in the food or chemical<br>
industries.<br>
The pharmaceutical industry consumes many tons of<br>
starch and lactose. These are in particular used as<br>
excipients in dry formulations such as, for example,<br>
powders for filling hard capsules, powders to be<br>
dissolved, pulverulent nutrient preparations and<br>
tablets.<br>
The food industry uses, for its part, this type<br>
of excipient in particular in foods and drinks to be<br>
dispersed and to be diluted.<br>
As regards the field which is of particular<br>
interest for the present invention, namely pharma-<br>
ceutical or food excipients, such excipients exist in<br>
the form of powders obtained by wet granulation of a<br>
mixture of lactose and starch, supplemented with<br>
binders or surfactants. These powders generally possess<br>
unsatisfactory direct tableting capacities.<br>
The most important factors for assessing the<br>
direct tableting capacity of a powder are the flow<br>
capacity (regular supply to the tableting chamber from<br>
the hopper), the resistance to abrasion (or non-<br>
friability) , and the cohesion after compacting of the;<br>
particles, which determines the hardness of the<br>
tablets. The tablets produced must be sufficiently hard<br>
to withstand breaking but at the same time have good<br>
disintegration properties when they are in the gastric<br>
medium.<br>
Among the excipients most commonly encountered in<br>
tableting, there may be mentioned in particular<br>
cellulose, starch, lactose and dicalcium phosphate.<br>
Microcrystalline cellulose fulfils all the<br>
conditions expected of a direct tableting excipient,<br>
but it remains difficult to produce and is relatively<br>
costly. It has, in addition, the disadvantage of<br>
causing a decrease in the hardness of the tablets<br>
following uptake of water during storage. Additionally,<br>
it causes an unpleasant sensation in the mouth.<br>
Lactose is a diluent which is widely used in<br>
tablet technology. It exists in two main forms:<br>
crystallized or spray-dried. Crystallized lactose<br>
exists in three different crystalline forms: anhydrous<br>
a-lactose (not commercially available), anhydrous P~<br>
lactose (usually referred to as anhydrous lactose) and<br>
a-lactose monohydrate. Anhydrous lactose has the<br>
disadvantage of being hygroscopic, which causes<br>
problems of stability over time, a-lactose monohydrate<br>
is stable but its tableting capacity and disintegration<br>
time remain inadequate. In order to improve the latter,<br>
lactose has been modified by spray drying and<br>
compression.<br>
Spray-dried lactose is highly compressible, and<br>
the spherical shape of its particles allows good flow<br>
properties. It is less stable and its storage period is<br>
shorter than that of crystalline lactose. Also, it does<br>
not possess disintegration properties. Tablets<br>
manufactured from spray-dried lactose develop a<br>
yellowish colour during storage which is more intense<br>
than that developed by lactose monohydrate.<br>
Compressed lactose is a stable powder which flows<br>
well but is less compressible than spray-dried lactose.<br>
The tableting properties of lactose remain<br>
inadequate but they have been improved by addition of a<br>
binding or diluent excipient possessing better<br>
tableting capacity, such as a microcrystalline<br>
cellulose. These mixtures can be easily tableted by<br>
virtue of the addition of a lubricant. Microcrystalline<br>
celluloses have, however, the disadvantage of a high<br>
price, and of a reduction in the hardness of the<br>
tablets formed following moisture uptake.<br>
As for starch, it has, because of the small size<br>
of its particles and its low density, the disadvantage<br>
of not flowing. The high elasticity of its granules<br>
make its tableting capacity inadequate to allow the<br>
manufacture of tablets of sufficient hardness. On the<br>
other hand, it possesses good disintegrating properties<br>
because of its swelling power in water. Starch can also<br>
serve as binder and diluent and even as flow-promoting<br>
agent.<br>
It has been proposed to combine lactose and<br>
starch by wet granulation (BODE-TUNJI M.O.,<br>
JAIYEOBA K.T., Labo-Pharma - Probl. Tech. - 32,<br>
No. 340, March 1984, pp 190-192) . However, it has been<br>
demonstrated that the addition of starch to lactose<br>
reduces the mean size of the granules and increases<br>
their friability, this effect being compensated for by<br>
the addition of a surfactant.<br>
It has also been proposed to granulate lactose<br>
and starch using a synthetic polymer as binder<br>
(WAN L.C., LIMK.S., S.T.P. Pharma Sciences 1 (5)<br>
285-293, 1991). The compositions obtained have an<br>
acceptable flow, but relatively low densities.<br>
Processes for the preparation, by spray-drying,<br>
of complex tableting excipients, such as that described<br>
in Patent US 5,006,345, comprising lactose, a binder<br>
such as polyvinylpyrrolidone or hydroxypropylmethyl-<br>
cellulose, and a disintegrating agent such as in<br>
particular crosslinked carboxymethylcellulose or<br>
carboxymethylated starch, are also known.<br>
A need therefore remains, which has not been<br>
satisfied, for a composition of lactose and starch<br>
granules possessing reduced friability, efficient flow,<br>
good tableting capacity and satisfactory disintegrating<br>
properties, while being only slightly hygroscopic.<br>
The aim of the invention is to satisfy this need<br>
and the applicant has had the merit of finding, after<br>
numerous studies, that this aim can be achieved when<br>
granules in accordance with the invention, based on<br>
starch and lactose, are used. To obtain such granules,<br>
the applicant has observed that, against all expecta-<br>
tions, it was advisable to use a granular starch and<br>
lactose mixture and to modify its physical charac-<br>
teristics by using an appropriate process such that<br>
moderate friability, satisfactory tableting capacity<br>
and efficient flow are obtained at the same time, while<br>
preserving the disintegrating properties.<br>
The invention thus concerns granules consisting<br>
of lactose and starch, characterized in that they<br>
exhibit a friability of less than or equal to 80%<br>
according to a test A.<br>
This test A consists in subjecting the granules<br>
to be tested to mechanical action in an apparatus<br>
called a friabilimeter. For this, an apparatus is used<br>
which is of the ERWEKA TA trademark manufactured by the<br>
company ERWEKA (GERMANY-6056 HEUSENSTAMM) revolving at<br>
a uniform rotating speed of 25 revolutions/minute, and<br>
equipped with a crushing chamber into which there are<br>
introduced 5 identical steel beads having a diameter of<br>
17 mm and a weight of 18.87 g. To carry out this test<br>
A, a quantity of 15 g of product having a particle size<br>
between 100 and 2 00 /im is introduced into the crushing<br>
chamber of this friabilimeter and then the apparatus is<br>
rotated for 5 minutes.<br>
At the end of the experiment, the proportion by<br>
weight represented by the residue retained on a sieve<br>
having a mesh width of 100 microns is determined.<br>
The friability value corresponds to the percen-<br>
tage of powder not retained by the sieve defined above.<br>
The greater the percentage of powder not retained by<br>
the sieve, the greater the friability.<br>
The granules in accordance with the invention<br>
exhibit, according to this test A, a moderate<br>
friability, that is to say of less than or equal to<br>
80%, and preferably less than or equal to 60%.<br>
The granules in accordance with the invention can<br>
also be characterized by a spherical structure when<br>
they are observed by scanning electron microscopy. This<br>
very specific structure is illustrated by Figures 1,1'<br>
and 2,2' which show the perfect sphericity of the<br>
granules obtained. Figure 1 shows a scanning electron<br>
micrograph of a granule according to the invention<br>
having a lactose/starch ratio of 75/25. Figure 2 shows<br>
a scanning electron micrograph of a granule according<br>
to the invention, having a lactose/starch ratio of<br>
85/15. By virtue of this spherical structure, the<br>
granules in accordance with the invention have a<br>
completely satisfactory flow.<br>
According to one embodiment of the invention, the<br>
granules are characterized by a lactose to starch ratio<br>
of between 90/10 and 25/75. It is indeed possible to<br>
vary at will the proportions of lactose and starch in<br>
the granules in accordance with the invention,<br>
depending on the use which it is desired to make<br>
thereof.<br>
"Lactose" is understood to mean lactose mono-<br>
hydrate as defined by the European Pharmacopoeia, 1997,<br>
0187 - p. 1111-1112. "Starch" is understood to mean<br>
natural or hybrid starches of any origin, of the<br>
granular type. Native maize starch is preferably used<br>
and, in particular, white maize starch such as that<br>
marketed by the applicant under the name "amidon<br>
extra-blanc" which makes it possible to obtain granules<br>
of completely satisfactory whiteness.<br>
Above 90% of lactose relative to the starch con-<br>
tained in the granules, the applicant observed that the<br>
said granules did not possess satisfactory disintegrat-<br>
ing properties. Below 25% of lactose, that is to say<br>
for more than 75% of starch in the granules, the latter<br>
can no longer be properly tableted because of the<br>
elastic properties of the starch and the flow proper-<br>
ties are not satisfactory.<br>
Preferably, a lactose to starch ratio of between<br>
85/15 and 50/50 will be chosen.<br>
According to another embodiment of the invention,<br>
the granules comprise lactose and starch and can,<br>
furthermore, contain any appropriate additive as long<br>
as it does not damage the desired properties of the<br>
final granules, such as in particular flavourings,<br>
colourings, stabilizing agents, disintegrating agents,<br>
binders, lubricants and preservatives. These may also<br>
be pharmaceutical or plant-protection active<br>
ingredients, or detergents.<br>
The granules in accordance with the invention can<br>
be characterized by their tableting capacity determined<br>
according to a test B.<br>
This test B consists in measuring the force,<br>
expressed in Newtons, which is representative of the<br>
tableting capacity of the composition of granules<br>
studied, given for two different values of density of<br>
tablets. This force represents the crushing resistance<br>
of tablets which are cylindrical with convex faces<br>
(radius of curvature of 14 mm) , having a diameter of<br>
13 mm, a thickness of 6 mm and apparent densities of<br>
1.3 and 1.4 g/ml. This tableting capacity, expressed at<br>
such densities of tablets, represents the advantageous<br>
properties of the granules according to the invention<br>
for the purposes of direct tableting.<br>
To carry out this test B, tablets are prepared<br>
from granules in accordance" with the invention to which<br>
0.5% by weight of magnesium stearate has been added<br>
beforehand as lubricant.<br>
The tableting is performed by means of an AM type<br>
FROGERAIS alternating press. This press is equipped<br>
with round dies with concave faces, having a diameter<br>
equal to 13 mm.<br>
The penetration of the top die and the filling<br>
volume of the bottom die are set on the press so as to<br>
vary the density of the tablets, and the corresponding<br>
hardness of these tablets is determined using an ERWEKA<br>
durometer of the TBH 3 0 GMD type.<br>
The granules in accordance with the invention<br>
whose lactose to starch ratio is between 90/10 and<br>
50/50 have a remarkable tableting capacity, superior to<br>
that of the prior art products, resulting in a tablet<br>
hardness greater than 7 0 N and preferably greater than<br>
80 N for a density of 1.3 g/ml, and greater than 170 N<br>
and preferably greater than 180 N for a density of<br>
1.4 g/ml.<br>
The granules according to the present invention<br>
are characterized, in addition, by an angle of repose<br>
of less than 45°, preferably of less than 40°. The<br>
determination of the angle of repose of a powder is one<br>
of the most widely used methods for assessing its flow<br>
properties. It involves measuring the height of a cone<br>
formed by the powder which has flown out of a cylinder<br>
of known volume, and deducing therefrom the angle<br>
formed by this cone as a function of the radius of the<br>
cylinder used. The greater the angle formed, the poorer<br>
the flow of the powder. By way of example, the angles<br>
of repose of the excipients most generally used in<br>
direct tableting vary between 35 and 67°, the highest<br>
values being observed with celluloses and the lowest<br>
being observed with granulated products such as<br>
sorbitol or modified dicalcium phosphate. Spray-dried<br>
lactose generally exhibits an angle of repose of the<br>
order of 46° (as indicated by STAMM A. et MATHIS C,<br>
Labo-Pharma - Problemes et Techniques - N°252 - Mars<br>
1976). As for starch, it does not, so to speak, flow.<br>
The granules in accordance with the invention<br>
possessing the characteristics mentioned above are<br>
capable of being obtained according to a multitude of<br>
variants, but most particularly according to a process<br>
characterized in that it comprises a step of spray-<br>
drying a suspension of lactose and starch. Surprisingly<br>
and unexpectedly, the applicant has observed that<br>
spray-drying applied to a suspension of lactose and<br>
native starch made it possible to obtain spherical<br>
granules possessing moderate friability, tableting<br>
capacity and efficient flow, while preserving dis-<br>
integrating properties. This aim had so far not been<br>
achieved by means of the processes known to persons<br>
skilled in the art and which are applicable both to<br>
lactose and to starch. The latter indeed has a dis-<br>
advantage when heat, processes are used, which is the<br>
risk of cooking and thus losing its granular and<br>
therefore disintegrating character.<br>
To carry out the spray-drying, a starch suspen-<br>
sion is prepared in cold water, to which lactose<br>
monohydrate is added. The mixture, having a temperature<br>
normally between 15 and 2 5°C, is then spray-dried in a<br>
conventional spray-drier known to persons skilled in<br>
the art, generally choosing an inlet temperature of<br>
around 160°C and a flow rate such that the temperatures<br>
of the air and of the spray-dried product are at around<br>
65°C at the outlet. Generally, an aqueous suspension of<br>
starch at 2 0% by weight will be used. The mixture may<br>
also comprise substances other than lactose and starch,<br>
as long as they are not subject to heat degradation. As<br>
regards the water content of the suspension containing<br>
the lactose and the starch, a dry matter content of 40<br>
to 50% will generally be used. The lactose used is<br>
preferably in monohydrate form. As regards the starch,<br>
any granular starch is suitable. Maize starch, and<br>
preferably so-called, "extra-blanc" maize starch such as<br>
that marketed by the applicant under this name will be<br>
advantageously chosen. The spray-dried powder can be<br>
used directly. It is provided in the form of perfectly<br>
spherical granules comprising co-spray-dried lactose<br>
and starch, and may thus be advantageously used as<br>
excipient, additive carrier or texturing agent in the<br>
food and pharmaceutical sectors. Many other<br>
applications of the granules in accordance with the<br>
invention can of course be envisaged because of the<br>
advantageous functional properties which they have, in<br>
particular in veterinary, plant-protection, and<br>
agricultural applications, as well as in the field of<br>
detergents.<br>
The invention will be understood more clearly<br>
with the aid of the following examples and the figures<br>
1,1' and 2,2" relating thereto, which are intended to<br>
be illustrative and nonlimiting.<br>
Example 1: Preparation of granules according to<br>
the invention and physical characterization<br>
Various compositions of granules consisting of<br>
lactose and starch in ratios of 85/15, 75/25, 50/50 and<br>
25/75 are prepared by co-spray-drying according to the<br>
invention. Lactose monohydrate and "extra-blanc" maize<br>
starch are used.<br>
The principal physical characteristics of the<br>
compositions prepared are given in the following table,<br>
in comparison with products of the prior art.<br>
The mean diameter is measured by an LS laser<br>
granulometer COULTER®, by the determination of the<br>
volumic repartition in granule size.<br>
The apparent density is measured according to the<br>
pharmaceutical technical method 2.9.15 of the European<br>
Pharmacopoeia, 3rd edition.<br>
The flow time is measured according to the<br>
pharmaceutical technical method 2.9.16 of the European<br>
Pharmacopoeia, 3rd edition.<br>
The angle of repose is measured on a POWDER TESTER<br>
apparatus commercialized by HOSOKAWA, according to the<br>
method developed by Carr.<br>
The granules according to the invention are<br>
provided in the form of dense powders, which is<br>
unexpected for spray-dried compositions. These powders<br>
have remarkable flow properties.<br>
Figures 1,1' and 2,2'<br>
The compositions of granules 75/25 and 85/15 as<br>
prepared in Example 1 are observed by scanning electron<br>
microscopy, and have a characteristic spherical<br>
structure.<br>
Example 2: Determination of the tableting<br>
profiles of the granules according to the invention<br>
A tableting profile is performed on the 50/50,<br>
75/25 and 85/15 compositions, as well as on a spray-<br>
dried lactose composition of the prior art, in the<br>
following manner:<br>
Tablets are prepared on an AM type Frogerais<br>
alternating press equipped with concave dies having a<br>
diameter of 13 mm, from a powder consisting of 99.5% of<br>
compositions of granules according to the invention and<br>
0.5% of magnesium stearate.<br>
Tablets having a thickness of 6 mm are obtained<br>
on which the density and the hardness on an ERWEKA<br>
durometer are determined. The disintegration time of<br>
the tablets is also determined, according to the method<br>
of the European Pharmacopea, 3rd edition.<br>
The results obtained are presented in the<br>
following table:<br>
Example 3: Study of storage stability<br>
In order to evaluate the stability of the tablets<br>
prepared from granules according to the invention,<br>
tablets are prepared with the preceding compositions of<br>
granules: 25/75, 50/50, 75/25, under the same<br>
conditions as Example 2.<br>
The weight and the density of these tablets are<br>
measured and then these parameters are again measured<br>
after storing the tablets for 2 months at room<br>
temperature.<br>
The variation in weight, expressed as a<br>
percentage, gives an indication of the level of<br>
hygroscopicity.<br>
The variation in the hardness gives an indication<br>
of the stability of the tablets.<br>
The following results are obtained:<br>
Example 4: Comparison between the friability of<br>
the granules according to the invention and those of<br>
the products of the prior art<br>
A granulation of lactose and starch is performed<br>
on fluidized air bed according to the method described<br>
by WAN L.C. et LIM K.S., STP PHARMA SCIENCES 4 (560-<br>
570) 1988.<br>
The 50/50 mixture according to the invention is<br>
granulated by pulverization of pure water ©, a solution<br>
of lactose © and a solution of polyvinylpyrrolidone (D<br>
which is the binder most often used in the<br>
pharmaceutical field, at a content of 5g for lOOg of<br>
the composition according to the invention.<br>
The friability is determined according to the<br>
previously described test A upon these three<br>
compositions as well as upon a composition of<br>
granulated lactose which is commercially available<br>
under the name TABLETTOSE® 80.<br>
The results are demonstrated in the following<br>
table:<br>
(*)the powder is so friable that the majority of the<br>
granules are destroyed during the preliminary sieving<br>
step between 100 and 200mm.<br>
It is surprising that the addition of starch which<br>
is reputed for increasing the friability of granules<br>
based on lactose has the opposite effect in the<br>
compositions according to the invention. The friability<br>
is as weak as that obtained by a conventional<br>
granulation process but with the addition of 5% of<br>
binder.<br>
Example 5 : Study of the shear stability of<br>
compositions according to the invention<br>
The compositions 75/25 and 85/15 prepared<br>
according to example 1 are mixed in an apparatus of the<br>
two-screw RUBERG type HM-50. The speed of the mixer is<br>
regulated at level 5. The volume of filling is at 30%<br>
for the 75/25 and 15% for the 85/15. The size of the<br>
particles of the tested composition is measured by<br>
sieving on successive sieves of 32,63,100,160,250 and<br>
315mm, before and after mixing for a period of 2, 5,<br>
10, 15, 20 and 25 minutes.<br>
The results are shown in the table below:<br>
There is no modification of the granulometry of<br>
the compositions during the mixing. The two screws of<br>
the mixer do not break the powder, because there is no<br>
formation of fines. This confirms the low friability of<br>
the compositions according to the invention,<br>
illustrated by their good stability to shearing.<br>
We claim;<br>
1. Granules consisting of lactose and starch, having a friability of iess<br>
than or equal to 80%, preferably 60%, according to a test A.<br>
2. Granules as claimed in claim 1, having a spherical structure under<br>
electron microscopy.<br>
