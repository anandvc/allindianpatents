				<td>The present invention relates to a terminal apparatus for connecting electrical conductors to electric equipment"<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to a terminal arrangement for connecting an electrical conductor to electric equipment. More specifically, the invention relates to a terminal arrangement that permits two conductors to be easily fastened to a terminal with both conductors in contact with the terminal.<br>
It is well known to couple electrical conductors to terminals of various electric equipment in a releaseable manner. For example, motors, transformers, generators, fuses, circuit breakers, switches and other electric equipment have screw terminals for releasably attaching electrical conductors thereto. Typically, such terminals consist of a relatively flat strip or plate having a hole formed therein. A screw is threaded through the hole and pressure plate is disposed around a shaft of the screw between the terminal and a head of the screw. An end of the conductor is disposed between the pressure plate and the terminal and the screw is tightened to push the pressure plate against the conductor and thus clamp the conductor between the pressure plate and the terminal. Often the conductor is a wire with a lug of a predefined shape attached to an end thereof and the lug is clamped against the terminal. The pressure plate can be omitted and the end of the conductor can be clamped between the head of the screw and terminal.<br>
In the conventional screw terminals of the type described above, if two conductors are to be connected to a single terminal, the two conductors are stacked on one another and clamped against the terminal. Accordingly, only one of the conductors is directly in contact with the terminal. This results in the full terminal current being transmitted through the single joining surface between the conductor adjacent the terminal and thus excessive heating can occur because ot the minimized area through which current flows. Further,<br>
Current flow through the conductors may be undesirably uneven,. Also, the conductors -.often are not securely clamped against the terminal because of the stacked arrangement thereof Further, when one conductor is to be removed from the terminal, both conductors must be removed and the conductor to be attached to the terminal must be repositioned in a clamping area. If two separate screws are provided in a terminal for connecting two conductors thereto, the terminal becomes relatively large and complex and the conductors may interfere with one another.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
To overcome the above-noted disadvantages in conventional screw terminals, the invention relates to a terminal apparatus for connecting electrical conductors to electric equipment, said apparatus comprising:<br>
•	a terminal electrically coupled to the electric equipment and having a hole<br>
formed therethrough;<br>
•	a first securing member having a head and a shaft and a second securing<br>
member; characterised by:<br>
said first securing member head and shaft passing through the hole formed<br>
in said terminal, a first conductor receiving area being defined between<br>
said head and a first side of said terminal;<br>
said second securing member being selectively engageable with said shaft<br>
on a second side of said terminal opposite said head of said first securing<br>
member, a second conductor receiving area being defined between said<br>
second securing member and said second side of said terminal; and<br>
a holder coupled to said terminal and disposed on said second side of said<br>
terminal, said holder retaining said second securing member at a position<br>
in which said second securing member can be engaged with an end of said<br>
shaft when said shaft is inserted through the hole formed in said terminal.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
The invention will be described through a preferred embodiment and<br>
the attached drawing in which:<br>
Fig. 1 is a sectional view of the preferred embodiment with the screw removed for insertion of conductors;<br>
Fig. 2 is a sectional view of the preferred embodiment used with one conductor;<br>
Fig. 3 is a sectional view of the preferred embodiment used with two conductors; and<br>
Fig. 4 is a top view of the holder of the preferred embodiment not attached to the terminal or electrical equipment.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
Figs. 1-3 illustrate the preferred embodiment of the invention. Terminal apparatus 10 includes terminal 12 connected to electric equipment 11. Electric equipment 11 can be any type of device requiring connection of an electric conductor thereto for power, control, or any other purpose and thus electric equipment 11 is illustrated schematically. For example, electric equipment 11, can be a motor, transformer, generator, fuse, circuit breaker, switch, bus bar, or other electric equipment. Terminal 12 includes a flat portion extending to an exterior of electric equipment 11.<br>
Holder 14, in the form of a cup in the preferred embodiment, is secured to a lower side of terminal 12, is secured to equipment 11, or is secured to both equipment 11 and a lower side of terminal 12. However, holder 14 can be secured in any manner that fixedly or movably couples holder 14 to terminal 12 to accomplish the function described below. Screw 16 has head 20 that is larger than a hole formed in terminal 12 and shaft 18 that is adapted to pass through the hole formed in terminal 12. When shaft 18 of screw 16 is inserted through the hole, head 20 of screw 16 is disposed on an upper side of<br><br>
terminal 12 and an end of shaft 18 enters a cavity defined by holder 14 on a lower side of terminal 12, as illustrated in Figs. 2 and 3. Nut 22 includes a female thread and is adapted to be threadably engaged to a male thread formed on shaft 18 of screw 16. As will be apparent from the description below, screw 16 serves as a first securing member and nut 22 serves as a second securing member.<br>
Compression member 24 can be disposed on shaft 18 of screw 16 near head 20 as illustrated. Compression member 24 serves to distribute the forces of head 20 over a relatively large area of a conductor when a conductor is received in a receiving area between an upper surface of terminal 12 and head 20. Compression member 24 can be a plate, a washer, a bushing, or the like and may be omitted if the size of head 20 is adequate for distributing forces. Compression member 24 can be fixedly coupled to screw 16 or can be separate therefrom.<br>
As best illustrated in Fig. 1, nut 22 is held captive in holder 14 to be positioned for receiving shaft 18 in a hole formed therein. The inner dimensions, i.e. a cavity size, of holder 14 are such that nut 22 can move up and down in the drawing but cannot escape the confines of holder 14 and is retained in an orientation in which the hole formed in nut 22 is positioned to receive shaft 18 therein. Also, nut 22 is prevented from turning substantially about an axis extending through the hole formed therein. For example, flat portions 26 defined on an inner surface of holder 14 can correspond to flat sides of nut 22, which can be octagonal, square or of any shape, to prevent turning of nut 22, as illustrated in Fig. 4. Shoulder portions 28 are defined in the cavity formed in holder 14 to define a first upper portion of the cavity in which nut 22 can be accommodated and a second lower portion of the cavity that is smaller than the first portion to prevent nut 22 from entering therein. When screw 16 is not engaged with nut 22, as illustrated in Fig. 1, nut 22 rests<br><br>
on shoulder portions 28.<br>
To secure a single conductor to terminal 12 and thus cause the conductor to electrically communicate with components of equipment 11, conductor Cl, having a substantially flat end portion with a hole formed therein, is positioned on the upper surface of terminal 12 with the hole of conductor Cl aligned with the hole formed in terminal 12. Subsequently, shaft 18 is inserted into the aligned holes and threads formed on an end of shaft 18 are caused to abut against threads formed in nut 22. In this position, head 20 of screw 16 can be turned to cause nut 22 to be threaded on shaft 18 of screw 16. In this manner, nut 22 is raised in holder 14 and eventually abuts against a lower surface of terminal 12 as illustrated in Fig. 2. Further turning of head 20 will place shaft 18 in tension to secure conductor Cl to terminal 12 with conductor Cl being pressed between compression member 24 and an upper surface of terminal 12. As illustrated in Fig. 2, an end portion of shaft 18 enters the small lower portion of the cavity formed in holder 14.<br>
Note that holder 14 is formed to define a space between an edge thereof and terminal 12 as indicated at X in Fig. 1. The dimensions of space X are adequate to permit a conductor to be passed therethrough. This configuration permits a second conductor to be received in a receiving area below terminal 12 thereby permitting two conductors to be secured to terminal 12 in the manner described below. When nut 22 rests on shoulder portion 28, an upper surface of nut 22 is at substantially the same level as the edge of holder 14 that defines space X. Beveled or chamfered portion 30 is defined on nut 22 to facilitate insertion of a conductor into space X. Attachment of two conductors is accomplished in a manner similar to that described above for one conductor. However, prior to inserting screw 16 through the holes of conductor Cl and terminal 12, a flat end of conductor C2, having a hole formed therein, is inserted into space x and received in an area<br><br>
below terminal 12 so that the hole in conductor C2 is aligned with holes in conductor Cl and terminal 12. Subsequently, shaft 18 is inserted through the holes in conductor Cl, terminal 12, and conductor C2 and threads formed on an end of shaft 18 are caused to abut against threads formed in nut 22. In this position, head 20 of screw 16 can be turned to cause nut 22 to be threaded on shaft 18 of screw 16. In this manner, nut 22 is raised in holder 14 and eventually abuts against a lower surface of conductor C2 as illustrated in Fig. 3. Further turning of head 20 will place shaft 18 in tension to secure conductors Cl and C2 to terminal 12 with conductor Cl being pressed between compression member 24 and an upper surface of terminal 12 and conductor C2 being pressed between nut 22 and a lower surface of terminal 12.. As illustrated in Fig. 2, an end portion of shaft 18 enters the small lower portion of the cavity formed in holder 14.<br>
The invention permits one or two conductors to be terminated to different sides of the same terminal so that both conductors are directly in contact with the terminal. Also, it is not necessary to access the nut and manually hold the nut in place during termination. A single conductor can be secured to either side of the terminal. The dimensions of the holder can be configured to restrain sideways movement of a conductor secured to the side of the terminal on which the holder is located. Because the conductors are secured to different sides of the terminal, a higher clamping force can be achieved and thus the invention is well suited for high current applications.<br>
The preferred embodiment was described in terms of relative directions of "up" and "down" and "upper" and "lower". However, the invention can be oriented in any manner and thus these terms are not intended to limit the structure of the invention. The holder of the preferred embodiment is round and cup-like. However, the holder can be of any shape or configuration that restricts movement of the nut in the manner described<br><br>
above. The opening defined by the cup for insertion of a conductor can be of any shape or configuration and can extend in any direction to permit various relative orientations between two conductors secured to the terminal. For example, the conductors can extend perpendicular to one another after being secured to the terminal.<br>
The invention can be used to couple one, two, or more conductors to electrical equipment or to one another. For example, the invention need not be coupled to electrical apparatus and can be used to join two or more conductors to one another, such as in a splice. Therefore, the phrase "electrical equipment" as used herein refers to any object to which an electrical conductor is to be attached and includes wires, bus bars, and the like. The invention can be used to connect wires to bus bars or to connect bus bars to one another. The preferred embodiment uses a screw and a nut as the securing members. However, any type of securing members can be used in the invention. For example, the securing members can include coaxial shafts that pressure fit with one another or mate through a bayonet configuration. Any securing members that are capable of being selectively attached to one another can be used.<br>
The conductors can be a round wire with a flat end or a wire with a flat lug thereon. The lug can be a spade type lug with a hole therethrough or a Y-shaped lug. In the case of a Y-shaped lug, it will be apparent the screw need not be removed from the nut during insertion of the conductors into the receiving areas on the terminal. Further, the wire and any lug can be of any shape and the receiving areas can be configured to accept any shape of wire or lug.<br>
