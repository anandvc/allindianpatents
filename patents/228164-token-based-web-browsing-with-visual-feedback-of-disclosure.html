FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001] The present invention relates to the field of computer science. More particularly, the present invention relates to a method and apparatus for token-based Web browsing with visual feedback of disclosure.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] The ability to quickly access information about various services is important to the typical user of a wireless user device such as a mobile phone or a personal data assistant (PDA). Such a user typically accesses information by entering the name of the item for which information is desired. For example, a user desiring to find a movie review for a film entitled "Dances with Wolves" would enter the keyword string "Dances with Wolves". The wireless user device must then obtain this information and render it to the user. Some of the information may reside locally on the user device, while other information must be obtained from an external source.<br>
[0003] In one solution, the wireless user device periodically communicates with one or more service providers to obtain updates for all information available to the wireless user device. This enables the user to store the entire body of information locally. Unfortunately, this solution requires a relatively large database on a user device. Such a local database typically becomes outdated quickly and is difficult to maintain.<br>
[0004] Another solution includes requiring the user search a World Wide Web ("Web") portal for the desired information. Unfortunately, this solution requires the user enter a relatively large amount of text. Furthermore, Web portals typically have a relatively large amount of latency and portal menus typically change frequently, confusing the user.<br>
[0005] Additionally, obtaining useful information from an external source such as a service provider often requires disclosing private data. For example, a user desiring weather information for the user's current location must first disclose the location. For various reasons, the user may not want this information disclosed.<br>
[0006] Accordingly, a need exists in the prior art for a solution that supports local searching on a device, such that a service is accessible by name. A further need exists for such a solution that minimizes the amount of text that a user must enter. Yet another need exists for a solution that maintains data on the device as long as possible. A further need exists for such a solution that allows private data to be incorporated into a search on a query-by-query basis, simply and efficiently, but with the user's knowledge and consent. Yet another need exists for such a solution that allows a relatively large amount of content to be stored on a wireless user device.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0007] A data communications network may be browsed using one or more tokens by receiving an input keyword string from a user, determining whether there is a match between the input keyword string and a database of keyword strings, determining a category of the keyword string, rendering to the user at least one service identifier associated with the category, receiving a user-selected service identifier in response to the rendering, substituting at least one variable in a resource locator template associated with the service with a string based at least in part on the keyword string entered by the user and launching the resource locator. According to one aspect, a special rendering of a hyperlink corresponding to the resource locator is used to indicate private data will be disclosed upon launching the resource locator.<br>

[0018] Figure 1 depicts a block diagram of a computer system 100 suitable for implementing aspects of the present invention. As shown in FIG. 1, system 100 includes a bus 102 which interconnects major subsystems such as a processor 104, an internal memory 106 (such as a RAM), an input/output (I/O) controller 108, a removable memory (such as a memory card), an external device such as a display screen 110 via display adapter 112, a roller-type input device 114, a joystick 116, a numeric keyboard 118, an alphanumeric keyboard 118, directional navigation pad 126 and a wireless interface 120. Many other devices can be connected. Wireless network interface 120, wired network interface 12 8, or both, may be used to interface to a local or wide area network (such as the Internet) using any network interface system known to those skilled in the art.<br>
[0019] Many other devices or subsystems (not shown) may be connected in a similar manner. Also, it is not necessary for all of the devices shown in FIG. 1 to be present to practice the present invention. Furthermore, the devices and subsystems may be interconnected in different ways from that shown in FIG. 1. Code to implement the present invention may be operably disposed in internal memory 106 or stored on storage media such as removable memory 122, a floppy disk or a CD-ROM.<br>
[0020] Turning now to FIG. 2, a block diagram that illustrates installing one or more databases on a wireless user device in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention is presented. Wireless user device 208 includes a user interface 212 configured to receive input from a user 202 and to render digital content to the user 202. Wireless user device 208 also includes a matcher 210 in communication with both the user interface 212 and a keyword string database. Matcher 210 is configured to receive an input keyword string from the user interface 212, and match the input keyword string with one or more other keyword strings in keyword string database 214. Wireless user device 208 also includes a menu constructor 216 configured to receive a keyword string from the matcher 210, determine the category of the keyword string. According to one embodiment of the present invention, the keyword string categories comprise a "brand" category for keyword strings that represent brands, a "title" category for keyword strings that represent titles and a "generic" category for keyword strings that belong to no other category.<br>
[0021] Still referring to FIG. 2, menu constructor 216 is configured to use the category to obtain one or more corresponding service identifiers and their associated resource locator template from a resource locator template database 220. Service identifiers and resource locator templates are explained in more detail below with reference to FIG. 7. The menu constructor is also configured to make a list or menu based upon the one or more corresponding service identifiers and provide the menu<br><br>
to user 202 via user interface 212. Wireless user device 208 also includes a resource locator populator 218 configured to receive an indication of the selected service and populate the corresponding resource locator template with the keyword string and the private data stored in private data store 222. Wireless network interface 224 is configured to communicate via network 230 to obtain the corresponding service from one or more service providers 232.<br>
[0022] The one or more service providers 232 are configured to initialize wireless user device 208 with a keyword string database 214 and a resource locator template database 220, The information used to populate databases 214 and 220 may be extracted from a memory (not shown in FIG. 2) under the control of the one or more service providers 232.<br>
[0023] Many other devices or subsystems (not shown) may be connected in manner similar to that shown in FIG. 2. Also, it is not necessary for all of the devices shown in FIG. 2 to be present to practice the present invention. Furthermore, the devices and subsystems may be interconnected in different ways from that shown in FIG. 2. The operations described with respect to matcher 210, user interface 212, resource locator populator 218, menu constructor 216 and wireless network interface 224 may be combined in various ways. Also, keyword string database 214, resource locator template database 220 and private data store 222 may be combined into a smaller number of databases, or further divided into a larger number of databases. Use of wireless user device 208 is described below in more detail, with reference to FIG. 4.<br>
[0024] Turning now to FIG. 3, a flow diagram that illustrates installing one or more databases for token-based browsing on a wireless user device in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention is presented. At 300, an initialization request is received. At 305, a keyword string database that includes one or more keyword strings representing the name of an object or the attributes of an object associated with a service is created. At 310, a resource locator template database that includes one or more entries comprising a service name and a resource locator template is created. At 315, the keyword string database and the resource locator template database are provided in response to the initialization request.<br>
[0025] Turning now to FIG. 4, a block diagram that illustrates using a wireless user device configured for token-based browsing in accordance with embodiments of the present invention is presented. Figure 4 illustrates use of wireless user device 408 after it has been initialized as described above with reference to FIG. 2. A user 402 enters an input keyword string comprising one or more keywords comprising one or more characters. User interface 412 receives the input keyword string and sends it to matcher 410. Matcher 410 receives the input keyword string and matches it with one or more other keyword strings in a keyword string database 414.<br><br>
[0026] According to one embodiment of the present invention, matcher 410 is configured to perform predictive matching, indicating a match based on incomplete input when further input cannot reduce the number of possible matches. Matches may be based on a prefix of a word. By way of example, the keyword string "jo" matches "John" and "jon", but not "mojo".<br>
[0027] According to another embodiment of the present invention, matches are based on one or more words in a keyword string, regardless of the order of keywords within the keyword string. By way of example, the keyword string "d jo" matches "doctor john smith" and "John dickenson". In this example, the "d" in "d jo" matches the "doctor" keyword of "doctor john" and the "dickenson" of "john dickenson". And the "jo" in "d jo" matches the "john" in "doctor john" and the "john" in "john dickenson".<br>
[0028] According to another embodiment of the present invention, a predetermined set of input characters are translated to the space character prior to performing a match. According to one embodiment of the present invention, the predetermined set of input characters comprises all non-alphanumeric characters. By way of example, the keyword string "d/jo" is translated to the keyword string "d jo", and the keyword string "j.d" is translated to the keyword string "j d". Thus translated, both keyword strings "d/jo" and "j.d" match the keyword string "john dickenson".<br>
[0029] Still referring to FIG. 4, matcher 410 returns a matching keyword string to user interface 412. User interface 412 receives the matching keyword string and communicates it to menu constructor 416. Menu constructor 416 receives the keyword string from the matcher, determines the category of the keyword string and uses the category to obtain one or more corresponding service identifiers and their associated resource locator template from a resource locator template database 220. Menu constructor makes a list or menu based upon the one or more corresponding service identifiers and provides the menu to user 402 via user interface 412. resource locator populator 418 receives an indication of the selected service and populates the corresponding resource locator template with the keyword string and private data if required by the resource locator template. Wireless network interface 466 receives the populated resource locator and communicates via network 430 to obtain a service from at least one service provider 432.<br>
[0030] Turning now to FIG. 5, a flow diagram that illustrates using a wireless user device configured with a token-based Web browser in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention is presented. At 500, a keyword string from a user is received. At 505, a determination is made regarding whether the received keyword string matches a keyword string in a database of keyword strings. According to one embodiment of the present invention, predictive matching is used to indicate a match based on incomplete input when further input cannot reduce the number of possible matches. At 510, the category of the keyword string is determined. At 515, at least one service identifier associated with the category is<br><br>
rendered to the user. At 520, a user-selected service identifier is received. At 525, at least one variable in a resource locator template associated with the service is substituted with a string based at least in part on the keyword string entered by the user. At 530, the resource locator is launched.<br>
[0031] Turning now to FIG. 6A, a block diagram that illustrates a keyword string database in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention is presented. As shown in FIG. 6A, keyword string database 600 comprises one or more keyword strings (602-612). Keyword strings in keyword string database 600 are compared with an input keyword string to determine a match. The keyword strings illustrated in database 600 are for purposes of illustration only. Those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that many other keyword strings are possible.<br>
[0032] Turning now to FIG. 6B, a block diagram that illustrates private data stored on a wireless user device in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention is presented. The exemplary private data shown in FIG. 6B is a user's location 622, service preference 624, wireless carrier 626, preferred language 628, dietary preference 630, name 632, age 634, social security number 636, bank card number 638 and email address 640. The private data illustrated in database 620 are for purposes of illustration only. Those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that many other private data are possible.<br>
[0033] Figures 7A - 7E illustrate resource locator templates and resource locator template databases in accordance with embodiments of the present invention. Figure 7A illustrates a resource locator template, and FIGS. 7B - 7E illustrate template databases for brands, titles, generic items and single-service objects, respectively. Each entry in the databases of FIGS. 7B-7D includes the name of a service and a resource locator template, while the database of FIG- 7E maps a specific keyword string to a resource locator template.<br>
[0034] Figures 8A -17 illustrate various mechanisms for providing visual feedback of information to be disclosed to an external entity, in accordance with embodiments of the present invention. Figures 8A - 8D illustrate methods for rendering a hyperlink that indicates private data will be disclosed upon launching the corresponding resource locator. Figure 9 illustrates rendering a request for data from an external device to indicate private data will be disclosed upon issuing the request. Figures 10-11 illustrate rendering a hyperlink to include a disclosure icon if the resource locator corresponding to the hyperlink requires private data. Figures 12A-13 illustrate rendering a resource locator as a hyperlink that shows the various levels of detail of private data to be disclosed upon user-selection of the hyperlink. Figures 14-15 illustrate incrementally updating a resource locator to indicate private data to be disclosed upon launching the resource locator.
