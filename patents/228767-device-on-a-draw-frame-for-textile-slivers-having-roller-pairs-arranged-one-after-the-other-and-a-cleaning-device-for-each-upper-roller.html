				<td>Device on a draw frame for textile slivers, having roller-<br>
pairs arranged one after theâ€”other and a cleaning device<br>
for each upper roller<br>
The invention relates to a device on a draw frame for<br>
textile slivers, having roller pairs arranged one after<br>
the other and a cleaning device, for example a cleaning<br>
lip, cleaning rod, for each upper roller, in which the<br>
loading device for each upper roller has at least two<br>
presser elements, for example pneumatic cylinders, each<br>
having a reciprocating component, for example? a presser<br>
rod, piston rod, and the cleaning device is mounted on<br>
the loading device.<br>
The draw frame is used to draft slivers, the slivers<br>
being clamped between two roller pairs with different<br>
rotational speeds. The roller pairs generally consist of<br>
a lower roller of steel and an upper roller having a<br>
resilient covering. The resilient covering has a tendency<br>
to wind up the silver. This is a very gradual process and<br>
begins with the picking-up of individual fibres. In order<br>
to avoid winding-up, attempts are made to remove these<br>
individual fibres from the upper roller and supply them<br>
to an extraction device by means of a cleaning bar<br>
(cleaning rod), which is usually round. The cleaning bar<br>
and the upper roller have to be arranged as far as<br>
possible axially parallel, so that linear contact is<br>
achieved. Otherwise the contact between the two compo-<br>
nents would be confined to a point and the cleaning<br>
action would thus be markedly reduced.<br>
The guidance of the cleaning bar is generally<br>
effected by additional elements having guide grooves<br>
which have to be positioned relative to the upper roller.<br><br>
In a known device (DE 198 07 801) a holder for receiving<br>
a cleaning lip for the upper roller is provided on the<br>
pressure cylinder. When the loading device is pivoted<br>
away, the cleaning lip can also be pivoted away<br>
therewith. The holder has an elongate hole in which a<br>
journal of the cleaning lip is guided. A disadvantage is<br>
that when the upper roller bearing is relieved of load,<br>
that is to say when the piston rod has been lifted away<br>
from the upper roller bearing but the cylinder is still<br>
in position, the cleaning bar remains lying on the rubber<br>
covering of the upper roller. The rubber covering has an<br>
elevated operating temperature and is frequently sticky<br>
with honeydew, resulting in an undesirable linear load on<br>
the stationary rubber covering. A further problem is that<br>
the mounting arrangement of the journal of the cleaning<br>
lip in a vertical elongate hole on each side of the upper<br>
roller can give rise to a clamping moment. In practice,<br>
fibre material can become lodged in the elongate hole,<br>
namely between the journal and the inner walls of the<br>
elongate hole. As a result, the cleaning bar is unable to<br>
move away from the rubber covering.<br>
The invention is therefore based on the problem of<br>
providing a device of the kind described at the beginning<br>
which avoids the mentioned disadvantages, which<br>
especially avoids impairment of the resilient covering of<br>
the upper roller when the piston rod is raised and which<br>
allows adaptable and stable guidance and mounting.<br>
This problem is solved by the characterising<br>
features of claim 1.<br>
Because the cleaning bar is associated with the<br>
presser rods, when the presser rods are relieved of load<br>
and subsequently lifted away from the upper roller<br><br>
bearings, the cleaning bar is lifted away1 from the rubber<br>
covering. Local pressure on the rubber covering is thus<br>
avoided. In addition, the scope for horizontal movement<br>
of the cleaning bar on the piston rods allows adaptable<br>
and stable guidance/mounting of the cleaning bar. Because<br>
the cleaning bar is exactly positioned relative to the<br>
upper roller, a better cleaning performance is achieved,<br>
the build-up of windings is reduced and thus the<br>
efficiency of the machine is increased. The reduction in<br>
the number of components (guide elements) reduces soiling<br>
in the drafting system and consequently increases the<br>
intervals between cleaning operations.<br>
Claims 2 to 2 9 include advantageous developments of<br>
the invention.<br>
The invention will be described in greater detail<br>
below with reference to embodiments shown in the drawing.<br>
Fig. 1 is a diagrammatic side view of a drafting<br>
system of a draw frame having the device<br>
according to the invention,<br>
Fig. 2 shows part of Fig. 1 in section,<br>
corresponding to line K-K (Fig. 1), with a<br>
pneumatic upper roller loading device,<br>
Fig. 3 is a perspective view of a presser arm<br>
with integral housing, two presser rods<br>
and a cleaning bar, and<br>
Figs 4a, 4b show a presser rod with a turned<br>
groove (Fig. 4a) and an engaged O-ring<br>
(Fig. 4b).<br>
Fig. 1 shows a drafting system S of a draw frame,<br>
for example a Trutzschler Strecke HSR. The drafting<br><br>
system S is configured as a 4 over 3 -drafting system,<br>
that is to say it consists of three lower rollers I, II,<br>
III (I output lower roller, II middle lower roller,<br>
III input lower roller) and four upper rollers 1, 2, 3,<br>
4. In the drafting system S, the drafting of the fibre<br>
bundle 5, which consists of a plurality of slivers, is<br>
carried out. The drafting operation is composed of the<br>
preliminary drafting operation and the main drafting<br>
operation. The roller pairs 4/III and 3/II form the<br>
preliminary drafting zone and the roller pairs 3/II and<br>
1,2/i form the main drafting zone. The output lower<br>
roller I is driven by the main motor (not shown) and thus<br>
determines the delivery speed. The input and middle lower<br>
rollers III and II are driven by a regulating motor (not<br>
shown) . The upper rollers 1 to 4 are pressed against the<br>
lower rollers I, II and III by presser elements 91 to 94<br>
(loading device) in presser arms 11a to l1d which are<br>
rotatable about pivot bearings (see Figs 3 and 4) and are<br>
thus driven by way of frictional engagement. The<br>
direction of rotation of the rollers I, II, III; 1, 2, 3,<br>
4 is indicated by curved arrows. The fibre bundle 5,<br>
which consists of a plurality of slivers, runs in<br>
direction A; the lower rollers I, II, III are mounted in<br>
stands 14 (see Fig. 2) which are arranged on the<br>
machinery frame 15.<br>
According to Fig. 2, the pneumatic cylinder 9 is<br>
associated at the top with a support element 12a and at<br>
the bottom with a holding element 13a. The pneumatic<br>
cylinder 9 forms a cylinder unit with a cylinder cavity<br>
17 having two portions 17a and 17b in which a piston 18<br>
is guided by means of a presser rod 19 in a sliding bush<br>
20. The roller journal 4a of the presser roller 4 engages<br>
in a bearing 22a. The bearing 22a accommodating the<br><br>
presser roller 4 extends into a chamber between the<br>
presser rod 19 and the roller journal IIIa of the lower<br>
roller III. The bearing 22a is mounted on the cover 13a.<br>
A membrane 16 divides the cylinder cavity 17 in terms of<br>
pressure. In order that pressure is generated in the<br>
upper portion of the cylinder cavity 17, the latter can<br>
be supplied with compressed air p1 by means of a<br>
compressed air connection 23. The lower portion of the<br>
cylinder cavity 17 is vented by means of a venting bore<br>
24. The upper portion of the cylinder cavity 17 can be<br>
vented and the lower portion of the cylinder cavity 17<br>
can be supplied with compressed air in corresponding<br>
manner. In operation, after a fibre bundle 5 has been<br>
guided over the lower rollers I, II, III, the presser<br>
arms 11 are pivoted into the operating position shown in<br>
Fig. 3 and fixed in that position by a fastening device<br>
(not shown), so that the presser rollers 1, 2, 3, 4 are<br>
able to exert pressure. Such a pressing action is<br>
produced on the one hand by the fact that the presser<br>
rods 19 each rest on the corresponding bearing 22 and on<br>
the other hand because an overpressure has been generated<br>
in the cavity above the membrane 16. As a result, the<br>
presser rod 19 presses with its other end on the bearing<br>
22 in order to create the mentioned pressing action<br>
between upper roller 4 and the lower roller (drive<br>
roller) III. The presser rod 19 is displaceable in the<br>
direction of arrows D, E. The resilient covering surface<br>
of the upper roller 4 is associated with a cleaning bar<br>
21, for example a steel rod.<br>
According to Fig. 3, the upper roller 4 is<br>
associated with the portal-shaped presser arm 11a. (The<br>
upper rollers 1 to 3 are associated with a corresponding<br>
presser arm 11 - not shown) . The presser arm 11a is in<br><br>
the form of a housing of glass-fibre-reinforced plastics<br>
and is produced by injection-moulding. The housing is an<br>
integral component which is of unitary construction and<br>
comprises the support element 12, the two bodies of the<br>
pressure elements 9a1 and 9a2 (pressure cylinders), two<br>
intermediate elements 31a and 31b and two holding<br>
elements 13a and 13b. During operation, the cleaning bar<br>
21 is located - as shown in Fig. 3 - on the upper roller<br>
4 and acts as a stripper. The cleaning bar 21 has at each<br>
of its two ends a fork 27a, 27b, which are, for example,<br>
screwed to the cleaning bar 21. The forks 27a, 27b<br>
consist of vibration-damping plastics in order to prevent<br>
the excitation of vibrations of the cleaning roller 21 on<br>
the upper roller. Its arrangement on the piston rods 19a,<br>
19b enables the cleaning bar 21 to be positioned exactly<br>
relative to the upper roller 4, because the guidance of<br>
the upper roller 4 and the position of the piston rods<br>
19a, 19b is ensured by the presser arm 11.<br>
The forks 27a and 27b are located on two resilient<br>
elements, e.g. two O-rings 28a and 28b, respectively,<br>
which are mounted on the piston rods 19a and 19b,<br>
respectively. As a result, the cleaning bar 21 is<br>
prevented from falling downwards, for example from the<br>
piston rods 19a, 19b. For removal, the cleaning bar 21<br>
needs merely be pulled by the fork over the resilient<br>
element from one side. The cleaning bar 21 is inserted by<br>
the reverse procedure. The forks 27a, 27b can be<br>
supported on the O-rings 28a and 28b, respectively, under<br>
gravity. There is advantageously play between the forks<br>
27a, 27b and the presser rods 19a, 19b.<br>
According to Fig. 4a, the presser rod 19a has a<br>
peripheral turned groove 29 into which, according to Fig.<br>
4b, a resilient O-ring 28a has been snapped.<br><br>
According to Fig. 2, the presser 'rod 19a, out of<br>
operation, has been pneumatically relieved of load and<br>
lifted away from the upper roller bearing 22a by distance<br>
a. As a result, the O-ring 28a is moved in direction S<br>
and accordingly, by way of the fork 27a, the cleaning bar<br>
21 is at the same time raised by distance b relative to<br>
the upper roller 4.<br><br>
