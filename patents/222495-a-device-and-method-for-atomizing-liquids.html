The invention relates to a device for atomizing liquids and a method for spray cooling of a liquid, said liquid being atomized.<br>
The invention also relates to a method for atomizing, spray cooling, and spray drying of liquids using a device of the kind referred to above.<br>
The invention fiirther relates to the use of a device of the kind referred to above for the production of powders from solutions or dispersions, preferably from emulsions.<br>
A device of the type referred to above is described in the publication of P. Schmid "Auslegung rotierender poroser Zerstaubungskorper', Verfahrenstechnik 8 (1974) No. 7. This publication provides a basic description of the utilization of a hollow cylinder with a plurality of circular hole-type nozzles.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
Document US 6 098 895 discloses a process and device for atomizing liquids. The liquid to be atomized is uniformly sprayed on the inner surface of a hollow rotating cylinder, for example by means of one central fluid-nozzle. Furthermore, the liquid leaves the cylinder through the bores 5 in the wall 1.<br>
The document US 6,651,898 relates to a device for atomizing liquids which has a) a rotatable apparatus for the reception of liquids to be atomized, the apparatus is defined by a cylinder having an interior chamber that runs the length of the cylinder with an internal diameter of about 10 to about 25 millimeters, the cylinder has an<br><br>
upper and end with an opening into the interior chamber, which opening is adapted to receive liquids to be atomized, the cylinder has a closed lower end that terminates with a floor, the outer surface of the cylinder is defined by an outer casing having a plurality of circular hole-type nozzles extending up about 20 to about 120 millimeters from the lower end of the cylinder in an axial direction, the hole-type nozzles are in fluid communication with the interior chamber for introducing the liquid to be atomized into the nozzles; and b) a drive operably connected to the cylinder for rotating the hollow cylinder. A method of spray cooling a liquid using the device of the invention, and a method of producing powders from solutions, dispersions, emulsions, or melts are also provided.<br>
The document EP 1186348discloses a device for atomizing liquids, which device comprises a rotatable hollow cylinder (11) for the reception of the liquid to be atomized, and a drive (12) for the rotation of the hollow cylinder (11), with the hollow cylinder being closed at its lower end with a bottom (13) and having an opening (15) at its upper end, and its casing (16) having a plurality of circular hole-type nozzles (18) for the output of liquids to be atomized, the device being characterized in that (a) the hollow cylinder (11) has a diameter which is in the range of from 10 to 25 millimeters, and (b) the surface of the cylinder casing (16), which has the circular hole type nozzles (18), extends in the axial direction over a length in the range of from 20 to 120 millimeter.<br>
The problem to be solved by the present invention is the provision of a device of the type set forth above with which a narrowO droplet size NS /12.07.2001 distribution can be achieved, whereby the average droplet size during the spraying should be in a range of from 50 to 500 micrometer, preferably in a range from 100 to<br><br>
350 micrometer. Moreover, it is a fundamental object within the scope of the present invention to provide a device of the type set forth above with which technically desirable throughputs during the process of atomizing liquids can be obtained and which thereby should operate with low wear. The structure and the dimensions of the hollow cylinder and of the circular hole-type nozzles in its casing should be selected in such a way that a uniform distribution of the liquid and its temperature in the aforementioned circular hole-type nozzles is obtained and that the circular hole-type, nozzles have a negligible tendency to get clogged. Furthermore, the hollow cylinder of the present invention should be easy to mount and dismount and the cleaning of the hollow cylinder as well as of the circular hole-type nozzles should be easy.<br>
A further object of the present invention is the provision of a method for atomizing, spray cooling, or spray drying of liquids with a device in accordance with the invention.<br>
As used herein, the term 'liquid includes solutions, especially aqueous solutions, dispersions and emulsions of active substances as well as melts, e.g., fat melts, optionally containing active substances. Examples of active substances are fat-soluble vitamins, such as, e.g., vitamin A, E, D, or K, carotenoids, such as, e.g., p-carotene, zeaxanthin, lutein, or astaxanthin, fat - or water-soluble pharmaceutically active substances, as well as water soluble vitamins, such as, e.g., vitamin C and the B vitamins.<br>
The advantages of a device according to the present invention are as follows: - it facilitates the generation of a laminar thread-like disintegration of the liquid<br><br>
to be atomized thereby achieving a narrow droplet size distribution, with the average droplet size during the spraying being in a range of 50 to 500 micrometer, preferably in a range of 100 to 350 micrometer,<br>
-	a very compact construction of the device for atomizing liquids due to a very simple structure, relatively small dimensions and the low weight of the hollow cylinder,<br>
-	a uniform distribution of the liquid and its temperature in the hollow cylinder and in the circular hole-type nozzles in the cylinder casing, by which means obstruction by drying or gelling processes and thereby clogging of the circular hole-type nozzles is prevented,<br>
-	a very low-wear operation which is achieved by the relatively low flow velocities in the borings of the circular hole-type nozzles of the hollow cylinder,<br>
-	considerable less energy is required for the rotation drive of the hollow cylinder compared to the energy required by conventional atomizing devices, and<br>
-	it is optimally suitable for relatively small liquid throughputs.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the hollow cylinder is screw-mounted on a co-rotating hollow shaft which serves for the feed of the liquid to be atomized into the hollow cylinder. The hollow cylinder can therefore be mounted and dismounted with little effort, which reduces the expenditure of time for maintenance procedures. By this means and by the very simple structure as well as the low wall thickness of the hollow cylinder, the hollow cylinder as well as the circular hole-type nozzles are easy to clean.<br><br>
By the relatively little additional expenditure for the feed conduit, a uniform distribution of the liquid and its temperature in the hollow cylinder and a uniform distribution of the liquid in the circular hole-type nozzles of the hollow cylinders casing are advantageously achieved despite the optionally larger dimensions of the hollow cylinder.<br>
By a method in accordance with claim 30, a very low clogging tendency of the circular hole-type nozzles as defined in the present invention is achieved.<br><br>

The feed conduit 31 is arranged in the cylinder 21 such that the longitudinal axis 34 of the feed conduit 31 coincides with the axis of rotation 27 of the hollow cylinder 21.<br>
The inlet 32 of the feed conduit 31 is attached to the opening 25 of the hollow cylinder 21 and thereby to the source of the liquid to be atomized.<br>
The outlet 33 of the feed conduit 31 is arranged inside the hollow cylinder 21 and at its end region where the floor of the hollow cylinder is located.<br>
The outlet 33 of the feed conduit 31 is directed towards the inner side of the cylinder casing 26, with the distance between this outlet 33 and<br><br>
the inner side of the cylinder floor 23 being much smaller than the distance between this outlet 33 and the opening 25 of the hollow cylinder 21.<br>
The distance between the outlet 33 of the feed conduit 31 and the inner side of the cylinder floor 23 is preferably in a range of from 1 to 20 millimeter.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the cylindrical side wall 35 of the feed conduit 31 has, in addition to the aforementioned outlet 33, several openings, with all of these openings being arranged in the axial direction between its inlet 32 and its outlet 33.<br>

The spraying is carried out with the spray arrangement 46, which has the following features:<br>
Circular hole diameter DB = 0.3 millimeter, Number of circular hole-type nozzles = 1000 Cylinder wall thickness s = 1 millimeter Diameter of the hollow cylinder DC = 25 millimeter Nozzle rotation n = 7000 revolutions/minute Emulsion throughput: 150 kg/hour.<br>
A powder with an average particle size of 200 to 250 micrometer is obtained at the outlet 47 of the spray container 45.<br>
