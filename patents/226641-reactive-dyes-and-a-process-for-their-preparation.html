Reactive dyes, a process for their preparation and their use<br>
The present invention relates ;o novel reactive dyes, to a process for their preparation and to their use in the dyeing or printing of textile fibre materials.<br>
The practice of dyeing using reactive dyes has recently led to higher demands being made on the quality of the dyeings and the profitability of the dyeing process. As a result, there continues to be a need for novel reactive dyes having improved properties, especially in respect of their application.<br>
Dyeing nowadays requires reactive dyes that have sufficient substantivity and at the same time have good ease of washing off of unfixed dye. They should also have a good colour yield and high reactivity, the objective being to provide especially dyeings having high degrees of fixing. The known dyes do not satisfy these requirements in all properties.<br>
The problem underlying the present invention is accordingly to find, for the dyeing and printing of fibre materials, novel improved reactive dyes having the qualities characterised above to a high degree. The novel dyes should especially be distinguished by high fixing yields and high fibre-dye bond stabilities. The dyes should also yield dyeings having good allround properties, for example fastness to light and to wetting.<br>
It has been found that the problem posed is largely solved by the novel dyes defined herein-below, especially when the dyes are used for dyeing synthetic polyamide fibre materials.<br>
The present invention therefore relates to reactive dyes of formula<br><br>
wherein<br><br>
Ri is optionally substituted C
R2 is halogen, d-C4alkyi, C1-C4alkoxy or sulfo,<br>
Zi is a radical of formula<br>
-SOrY	(2a),<br>
-CO-NH-(CH2)k-S02-Y	(2b),<br>
-NH-CO-CH(Hal)-CH2-Hal	(2c) or<br>

n is the number 0, 1 or 2 and<br>
m is the number 0 or 1.<br>
The dyes of formula (1) according to the invention are fibre-reactive. Fibre-reactive compounds are to be understood as compounds that are capable of reacting with the hydroxyl groups of cellulose, with the amino, carboxy, hydroxy or thiol groups in wool and silk or with    -the amino groups and, optionally, with the carboxy groups of synthetic polyamides, to form covalent chemical bonds.<br>
C1-C4Alkyl Ri is, for example, methyl, ethyl, n-propylf isopropyl, n-butyl, sec-butyl, tert-butyl or isobutyl, preferably methyl or ethyl, especially ethyl. The alkyl radical Rn is unsubstituted or substituted, for example, by hydroxy, sulfo, sulfate cyano or by carboxy. The unsubstituted radical is preferred.<br>
As C1-C4alkyl there come into consideration for R2 e.g. methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, sec-butyl, tert-butyl and isobutyl, preferably methyl or ethyl, especially methyl.<br>
As C1-C4alkoxy there come into consideration for R2 e.g. methoxy, ethoxy, n-propoxyf isopropoxy, n-butoxy, sec-butoxy, tert-butoxy and isobutoxy, preferably methoxy or ethoxy, especially methoxy.<br><br>
As halogen there come into consideration for R2 e.g. fluorine, chlorine and bromine, preferably chlorine or bromine, especially chlorine;   <br>
As a group U removable under alkaline conditions there come into consideration e.g. -CI, -Br, -F, -OS03H, -SS03H, -OCO-CH3, -OPO3H2, -OCO-C6H5, -OSOz-Ci-Caalkyl and -OS02-N(C:-C4alkyl):.

with cyanuric chloride, R1( R2, Zi, m and n having the definitions and preferred meanings given above.<br>
Since the individual process steps can be carried out in different orders, including, if desired, simultaneously, various process variants are possible. The reaction is usually carried out stepwise, the order in which the single reactions between the individual reaction components is carried out advantageously being governed by the particular conditions. For example, about one molar equivalent of an amine of formula (3) is reacted with about one molar equivalent of cyanuric chloride and the resulting product is then condensed with about one molar equivalent of a compound of formula (2). In another process variant, for example about one molar equivalent of a compound of formula (2) is reacted with about one molar equivalent of cyanuric chloride and the resulting mixture is then condensed with about one molar equivalent of an amine of formula (3).<br>
The individual condensation reactions are carried out e.g. in accordance with processes known perse, generally in aqueous solution, at a temperature of e.g. from 0 to 50°C, especially from 0 to 10°C, and a pH of e.g. from 1 to 10, especially from 1 to 7.<br>
The end product can optionally also be subjected to a transformation reaction. Such a transformation reaction is, for example, the conversion into its vinyl form of a reactive group in the radical Zi that is capable of being vinylated, e.g. by treatment with dilute sodium hydroxide solution, for example the conversion of the p-sulfatoethylsulfonyl or p-chloroethylsulfonyl group into the vinylsulfonyl radical or the conversion of the a,p-dihalopropionylamino group into the a-haloacryloylamino radical. Such reactions are known perse. Such a transformation reaction is generally carried out in a neutral to alkaline medium at a temperature of e.g. from 20 to 70°C, at a pH of e.g. from 6 to 14.<br>
The compounds of formulae (2) and (3) are known or can be prepared analogously to known processes.<br>

The above-described embodiment yields brilliant green hues that exhibit scarcely any catalytic fading.<br>
The reactive dyes of formulae (4), (5), (6) and (7) are known or can be prepared analogously to known processes.<br>
The sulfo groups present in the reactive dye of formula (1) according to the invention and in the reactive dyes of formulae (4), (5), (6) and (7) are each either in the form of their free acid<br><br>
or, preferably, in the form of a salt thereof. Salts that come into consideration include, for example, the alkali metal, alkaline earth metal and ammonium salts, salts of an organic amine and mixtures thereof. Examples that may be mentioned are sodium, lithium, potassium and ammonium salts, the salt of mono-, di- or tri-ethanolamine and Na/Li or Na/Li/NH4 mixed salts.<br>
The reactive dyes of formula (1) according to the invention and the reactive dyes of formulae (4), (5), (6) and (7) may comprise further additives, e.g. sodium chloride or dextrin.<br>
The process according to the invention and the reactive dyes of formula (1) can be used in accordance with customary dyeing or printing processes. In addition to comprising water and the dyes, the dyeing liquors or printing pastes may comprise further additives, for example wetting agents, anti-foams, levelling agents or agents that influence the properties of the textile material, for example softeners, additives for flame-resistant finishes or dirt-, water- and oil-repellents and also water-softeners and natural or synthetic thickeners, e.g. alginates and cellulose ethers.<br>
The amounts in which the individual dyes are used in the dye baths or printing pastes may vary within wide limits depending on the desired depth of colour; amounts of from 0.01 to 15 % by weight, especially from 0.1 to 10 % by weight, based on the goods to be dyed and the printing paste have proved advantageous.<br>
Printing methods such as, for example, displacement printing or space dyeing are important in the case of carpet fabrics.<br>
Preference is given to dyeing that is carried out especially according to the exhaust method and, in the case of carpet dyeing, it can also be carried out according to the continuous method.<br>
Synthetic polyamide fibres are preferably dyed at a pH value of from 2 to 7, especially from 2.5 to 5.5, more especially from 2.5 to 4. The liquor ratio can be selected from within a wide range, e.g. from 1:5 to 1:50. preferably from 1:5 to 1:30. Dyefng is preferably carried out at a temperature of from 80 to 130CC, especially from 85 to 120°C.<br><br>
In order to enhance the wet-fastness properties of dyed synthetic polyamide fibres, an aftertreatment can be carried out at a pH value of e.g. from 7 to 12. especially from 7 to 9, and a temperature of e.g. from 30 to 100*C. especially from 50 to 80°C, to remove any unfixed dye. In the case of intense hues, for example in the case of dyeings of very deep colour, especially on fibre biends, unfixed dye can advantageously be removed reductively, by adding to the alkaline aftetreatment bath a reducing agent, for example a hydrosulfite, e.g. sodium hydrosulfite. Dye that has been fixed in the fibre material is not attacked by the treatment. Advantageously, the amount of reducing agent added is e.g. from 0.1 to 6 % by weight, especially from 0.5 tc 5 % by weight, based on the weight of the aftertreatment bath.<br>
The reactive dyes used in the process according to the invention are distinguished by uniform colour build-up, good affinity and good fixing ability, good constancy of shade even at different concentrations, good fastness properties and are especially also readily combinable with other dyes. The reactive dyes used in the process according to the invention are advantageously suitable for metamerism control, that is to say, two shades that match in daylight will also match in other light, for example artificial light.<br>
Synthetic polyamide fibre materials suitable for dyeing or printing in accordance with the invention include, for example, polyamide-6 (poly-e-caprofactam), polyamide-6,6 (polyhexa-methyleneadipamide), poiyamide-7, polyamide-6,12 (polyhexamethylenedodecanoamide), polyamide-11 and polyamide-12, copolyamides with polyamide-6,6 or with polyamide-6, e.g. polymers of hexamethylenediamine, £-caprolactam and adipic acid and polymers of adipic acid, hexamethylenediamine and isophthalic acid or of adipic acid, hexamethylenediamine and 2-methylpentamethylenediamine or 2-ethyltetramethylenediamine, and also blend fabrics or mixed yams of synthetic polyamide and wool.<br>
The process according to the invention and the reactive dyes according to the invention are advantageously suitable also for dyeing or printing microfibres of synthetic polyamides. Microfibres are understood to mean fibre materials constructed from threads having an individual thread fineness of 1 denier (1.1 dTex). Such microfibres are known and are usually produced by melt-spinning.<br>
The said textile material may be in an extremely wide variety of manufactured forms, e.g. in the form of fibres, yarns, woven fabrics or knitted fabrics and in the form of carpets.<br><br>
Level dyeings having good aiiround properties, especially good fastness to rubbing, to wetting, to wet rubbing and to light, are obtained<br>
The following Examples serve to illustrate the invention. The temperatures are given in degrees Celsius. Unless otherwise indicated, parts are parts by weight and percentages relate to percent by weight. Parts by weight relate to parts by volume in the same ratio as kilograms to litres.<br>
Example 1:<br>
a) 4.7 parts of cyanuric chorice are suspended in the course of from 10 to 15 minutes at a temperature of from 0 to 2°C in 47 parts of ice, 23 parts of water and 0.025 part of Na2HP04 x 12H20.

in 150 parts of water and 18.1 parts of an aqueous 2N sodium hydroxide solution is then fed in, the pH being maintained at a value of 5 by the addition of aqueous 2N sodium hydroxide solution. Stirring is then carried out for 40 minutes at a temperature of from 0 to 2°C. A solution is obtained, which comprises the compound, indicated in the form of the free acid, of formula<br><br><br>

During the addition, the pH is maintained at a value of 6 by means of aqueous 2N sodium hydroxide solution. Stirring is then carried out overnight at a temperature of from 0 to 2°C and a pH value of 6. For the purpose of converting the (3-sulfatoethylsulfonyl form into the vinyl form, the pH value is adjusted to 10 using 2N sodium hydroxide solution and stirred for 30 minutes at room temperature. The reaction mixture is then rendered neutral using dilute hydrochloric acid and, after the addition of sodium chloride, is subsequently stirred for one hour in an ice bath. The precipitated dye is filtered off, washed with aqueous sodium chloride solution and dried at a temperature of 40°C. A dye is obtained which, in the form of the free acid, corresponds to the compound of formula<br><br>

Process Example 4: In a dyeing apparatus,! 00 kg of textured polyamide-6f6 jersey are treated for 10 minutes at 40°C with 2000 litres of liquor containing 4 kg of acetic acid, 0.5 g of wetting agent and 1 kg of a levelling agent. The pH of the liquor is 3.4. There are then added, predissolved in a small amount of water, 430 g of the dye of formula (101) and 440 g of the dye of formula (108).<br><br>
t<br>
The material to be dyed is treated in the dye liquor for 5 minutes at 40°C and then heated to 98°C at a heating rate of 1°C/min and dyed at that temperature for 60 minutes. The dyeing is finished in the usual manner. A brilliant green level dyeing having very good fastness properties is obtained.<br>
Process Example 5: In a dyeing apparatus, 70 kg of a fabric of polyamide-6,6 microfibres are treated for 10 minutes at 40°C with 1500 litres of liquor containing 3 kg of formic acid, 0.4 kg of wetting agent and 0.7 kg of a levelling agent. The pH of the liquor is 2.9. There are then added, predissolved in a small amount of water, 700 g of the dye of formula (107), 1300 g of the dye of formula (106) and 430 g of the dye of formula (101). The material to be dyed is treated in the dye liquor for 5 minutes at 40°C and then heated to 110°C at a heating rate of 1 °C/min and dyed at thatte.mperature for 60 minutes. The dyeing procedure is followed by an alkaline aftertreatment in order to improve the wet-fastness properties. For that purpose, a fresh bath containing 2 g/l of soda and having a pH of 9.2 is used to treat the dyeing for 20 minutes at 60°C. The dyeing is then rinsed and finished in the usual manner. A level dyeing having excellent fastness properties is obtained.<br>
