				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to a storage container for a scooter type of motor vehicle.<br>
Storage containers for scooter type motor vehicles are known to the art and are of various kinds.<br>
Some of the salient features of the storage container proposed herein are:<br>
*	It has at least one detachable partition member and means for engaging with the inner wall or floor of a recess in the container. Thus, the said member is engageable with the inner wall or the floor of the recess or with both the inner wall and the floor of the said recess. With a member or members in engagement, a plurality of partitions are formed for storing various articles, such as, toiletries, towels, lunch boxes and so on. Since the said members are detachable, they are removable and can be stowed away in the recess, when not in use.<br>
*	In the event of water entering the recess, it is drained away through a drain hole provided on the floor of  the recess. The said floor has a gradient  for  the<br><br>
gravity flow of water to the drain hole. In order that the partition members, when installed, do not impede the drainage of water, a gap between the bottom of the said members and the floor of the recess is provided for the flow of water to the drain hole to take place.<br>
*Specific provision is made for storing a water bottle in the container for which a cavity is made in the recess. The cavity communicates with the drain hole.<br>
*The container itself is receivable in a thrust-fit  in<br>
an opening in the space frame of the vehicle below the<br>
seat, so that the container is easily lifted out of the<br>
opening and put back again without the need for any<br>
fasteners, such as screws or bolts.<br>
* The recess has a shelf for receiving small articles<br>
of  everyday  use,  such as,  spectacles,  writing<br>
instruments and so on*<br>
Various other features of this invention will be<br>
apparent from the following further description given<br>
hereunder.<br><br>
The storage container for a scooter type motor vehicle provided with a hinged dual seat and seat lock, according to this invention, comprises a recess with a mouth at its top and at least one detachable partition member; means for engaging the partition member with the inner wall, floor, or both the inner wall and floor, of the said recess, to form a plurality of chambers within the recess; a water drain hole on the floor of the recess, the floor having a downward gradient in the direction of the drain hole to enable any water in the recess to flow down the gradient to the drain hole; the said container being receivable in a thrust-fit in an opening in the space frame of the vehicle, below the said seat, the profile of the mouth of the recess substantially matching the profile of the seat such that the said seat is hingeably movable up and down to open and close the mouth of the recess. This invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings which illustrate by way of example, and not by way of limitation, one of various possible embodiments of the storage container proposed herein, wherein<br><br>
Fig. 1 illustrates the said embodiment in perspective plan view<br>
Fig. 2 illustrates the said embodiment in another perspective plan view with partition members in place<br>
Fig.3.  illustrates the said embodiment in yet another<br>
perspective plan view without any partition members  in<br>
place, but with a helmet Z accommodated in the recess<br>
and<br>
Fig.  4 illustrates the lug and rib engagement of the<br>
body of the container and the space frame.<br>
The container C encloses a recess R with a mouth M at its top and one or more detachable partition members P. These members will be in any predetermined shape and size suited to perform the function of partitioning the recess into several chambers for accommodating various articles referred to above in the chambers.<br>
Means are provided for engaging the members with the inner wall W of the recess or with the floor F of  the<br><br>
recess or with both, depending upon the requirements of specific applications.<br>
One form of such means comprises grooves K provided on the inner wall of the recess R, with which the sides of the members P can be engaged to provide partitions.<br>
An alternative form of such means comprises clips<br>
(not illustrated) into which the sides of the members P<br>
are slidably engageable.<br>
It will be visualised that other forms of such means<br>
are possible.<br>
The members P can thus be installed in any plane or<br>
angle within the recess R by using the said means.<br>
A water drain hole H is provided on the floor F of the<br>
recess for draining out any water in the recess,  such<br>
as, water which may have entered the recess from outside<br>
or water which may have spilt into the recess.<br>
The floor has a downward gradient in the direction of<br>
the drain hole H sufficient to enable any water  in the<br>
recess to flow down the gradient to the drain hole.<br>
The container itself is receivable in the opening in<br><br>
the space frame, below the said seat, in a thrust fir. The profile of the mouth of the recess substantially natches the profile of the seat such that the said seat is hingeably movable up and down to open and close the mouth of the recess.<br>
The recess has a shelf S for keeping small articles such as a spectacle case, writing instruments and so on.<br>
S1 is a first slot for viewing the chassis number inscribed on the chassis of the vehicle.<br>
A second slot S2 is provided for access to the fuel tank filler cap.<br>
A third slot S3 exposes the latch of the seat lock. Whenever the seat is moved down over the mouth M of the recess,  the striker on the underside of the seat hits<br>
the latch to lock the seat in place.<br><br>
A partition member P, whenever in engagement, with the inner wall or with the floor or both with the inner wall and the floor of the recess leaves a gap between<br><br>
the bottom of the said member and the floor of the recess, the said gap being sufficient to permit water on the said floor to flow down to the drain hole. The floor of the recess is provided with a cavity N for receiving a bottle, such as, a bottle of water or other liquid. The cavity communicates with the drain hole H. The rim of the recess has, on its sides, a lip Y of an inverted U-section for resting on the bars of the space frame of the vehicle and for being supported thereon. The sides of the container are also provided with lugs L which enter the slots SL provided on the side panels of the vehicle. The lip Y and the lugs L thus hold the container securely in place with respect to the space frame.<br>
The terms and expressions herein are of description and not of limitation, there being no intention in the use of such terms and expressions of excluding any equivalents of the features illustrated and described, but it is understood that various other embodiments of the storage container proposed herein are possible without departing from the scope and ambit of this invention.<br><br>
