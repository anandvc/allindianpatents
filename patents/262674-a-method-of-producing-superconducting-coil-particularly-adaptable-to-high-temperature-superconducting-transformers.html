				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to a method of manufacturing superconducting coils in<br>
general and in particular for high temperature superconducting transformer/<br>
more particularly, the invention relate to a method of producing superconducting<br>
coils, particularly adaptable to high temperature superconducting transformers.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
Electrical machines having field coil windings generally comprise a stator and<br>
rotor that are electromagnetically coupled. The rotor may include a multi-pole<br>
rotor core and one or more coil winding mounted on the rotor core. The rotor<br>
cores may include a magnetically-permeable solid material, such as an iron-core<br>
rotor.<br>
Conventional copper windings are commonly used in the rotors of synchronous<br>
electrical machines. However, the electrical resistance of copper windings<br>
(although low by conventional measures) is sufficient to contribute to substantial<br>
heating of the rotor and to diminish the power efficiency of the machine.<br>
Recently, super-conducting (SC) coil windings have been developed for rotors.<br>
SC windings have effectively no resistance and are highly advantageous rotor coil<br>
windings.<br>
Iron-core rotors saturate at an air-gap magnetic field strength of about 2 Tesla.<br>
Known super-conductive rotors employ air-core designs, with no iron in the<br>
rotor, to achieve air-gap magnetic fields of 3 Tesla or higher. These high air-gap<br>
magnetic fields yield increased power densities of the electrical machine, and<br>
result in significant reduction in weight and size of the machine. Air-core super-<br>
conductive rotors require large amounts of super-conducting wire. The large<br>
amounts of SC wire add to the number of coils required, the complexity of the<br>
coil supports, and the cost of the SC coil windings and rotor.<br>
High temperature SC coil windings are formed of super-conducting materials that<br>
are brittle, and must be cooled to a temperature at or below a critical<br>
temperature, e.g., 27.degree. K, to achieve and maintain super-conductivity. The<br>
SC windings may be formed of a high temperature super-conducting material,<br>
such as a BSCCO (Bi.Sub.x Sr.sub.x Ca.sub.x Cu.sub.x O.sub.x) based conductor.<br>
According to prior art, super-conducting coils can be cooled by liquid helium.<br>
After passing through the windings of the rotor, the hot, used helium is returned<br>
as room-temperature gaseous helium. Using liquid helium for cryogenic cooling<br>
requires continuous reliquefaction of the returned, room-temperature gaseous<br>
helium, and such reliquefaction poses significant reliability problems and requires<br>
significant auxiliary power.<br>
Prior SC coil cooling techniques include cooling an epoxy-impregnated SC coil<br>
through a solid conduction path from a cryocooler. Alternatively, cooling tubes in<br>
the rotor may convey a liquid and/or gaseous cryogen to a porous SC coil<br>
winding that is immersed in the flow of the liquid and/or gaseous cryogen.<br>
However, immersion cooling requires the entire field winding and rotor structure<br>
to be at cryogenic temperature, as a result no iron can be used in the rotor<br>
magnetic circuit because of the brittle nature of iron at cryogenic temperatures.<br>
In addition, high temperature super-conducting (HTS) coils are sensitive to<br>
degradation from high bending and tensile strains. These coils must undergo<br>
substantial centrifugal forces that stress and strain the coil windings. Normal<br>
operation of electrical machines involves thousands of start up and shut down<br>
cycles over the course of several years that result in low cycle fatigue loading of<br>
the rotor. Furthermore, the HTS rotor winding should be capable of withstanding<br>
25% over-speed operation during rotor balancing procedures at ambient<br>
temperature and notwithstanding occasional over-speed conditions at cryogenic<br>
temperatures during power generation operation. These over-speed conditions<br>
substantially increase the centrifugal force loading on the windings over normal<br>
operating conditions.<br>
High strains can damage HTS super-conductor wire. To withstand high strains,<br>
HTS wire have in the past been protected by massive and complex coil winding<br>
and coil support structures. However, massive, complex super-conducting<br>
windings and supports are costly, especially in state-of-the-art air core electrical<br>
machines. Moreover, these massive windings have to be cooled to cryogenic<br>
temperatures, and thus require large refrigeration systems.<br>
The coil windings also are isolated from the hot coil supports and rotor. To<br>
isolate the coil windings, large thermal insulators have been used to separate the<br>
coils from their support systems. Because the insulators are between the coils<br>
and their support systems, prior thermal insulators are large structures that can<br>
support the high centrifugal loading of coils. Because these large thermal<br>
insulators are in contact with the cold coils, the insulators are a large heat source<br>
to the coils. While the isolators are designed to minimized heat conduction to the<br>
coils, the insulators result in large cryogenic heat loads and expensive<br>
cryorefrigerators.<br>
Earlier to developing the high temperature superconducting coils, Low<br>
Temperature Super Conductors (LTSC) required were in use, which liquid helium<br>
at 4.2 K for cooling. Liquid helium is expensive gas difficult to handle. With the<br>
reason it could not find wider acceptance for commercialization.<br>
High temperature superconducting transformers are one of the future areas for<br>
application of high temperature superconductors for commercialization.<br>
High temperature superconducting transformer is smaller in size, weight and<br>
volume and more efficient. They are commercially viable for higher rating where<br>
high voltage in variably used for bulk transmission of power.<br>
Disk winding is preferred over layer winding for high voltage transformer as it<br>
distributes the voltage requiring less insulation etc. With the lesser capacitance in<br>
high voltage transformer, it is vulnerable to voltage spikes requiring use of disk<br>
winding.<br>
High temperature superconductors made of ceramic material is available in tape<br>
form typical size 0.40mm X 0.30 mm. It does not have strength on its own; it<br>
requires mechanical support when formed in a in coil form. Coils have to be<br>
invariably immersed in liquid nitrogen in order to get superconducting properties.<br>
The superconducting coils recently been developed, mostly formed with a layer<br>
winding. Layer winding reduces the effect of perpendicular linkage of flux with<br>
less coil will be less. Superconductor current carrying capacity reduces with the<br>
presence of perpendicular flux over its surface. In layer type of superconducting<br>
winding, superconducting tape is wound over an insulated spool or bobbin like<br>
Glass fibre reinforced Plastic. Grooves are made over the hollow GFRP spool in<br>
which HTSC tape runs. Number of concentric spools are used depending upon<br>
the number, of coils. GFRP spools or bobbins are immersed in liquid nitrogen. In<br>
this case superconducting tape is in direct contact with liquid nitrogen only on<br>
one side, moreover liquid nitrogen is not circulated freely in the container<br>
carrying bobbins along with winding. In case of fault in the one spool winding,<br>
one full spool winding has to be replaced with costly superconducting tape.<br>
In the disk winding, stacked disks are used one above the other affecting the<br>
cooling efficiency though voltage distribution is better than layer winding.<br>
OBJECTS OF INVENTION<br>
It is therefore an object of the invention is to propose a method of producing<br>
superconducting coils, particularly adaptable to high temperature<br>
superconducting transformers, which eliminates the disadvantages of prior art.<br>
Another object   of the invention is to propose a method of producing<br>
superconducting     coils, particularly adaptable to high temperature<br>
superconducting   transformers, which requires a smaller capacity of cooling<br>
means.<br>
A still another object of the invention is to propose a method of producing<br>
superconducting coils, particularly adaptable to high temperature<br>
superconducting transformers, which provides an improved voltage distribution<br>
so as to require less insulation and reduced electrical stresses.<br>
A further object of the invention is to propose a method   of producing<br>
superconducting coils, particularly adaptable to high     temperature<br>
superconducting transformers, which is cheap to manufacture  and easy for<br>
maintenance.<br>
Accordingly there is provided a method of producing superconducting coil<br>
particularly adaptable to high temperature superconducting transformer, in the<br>
form of disk winding with superconducting tape, comprising the steps: of<br>
providing a top circular ring and a bottom circular ring and joining the rings with<br>
a plurality of stiffeners by means of several non-magnetic insulated screws to<br>
form a circular configuration, the stiffeners have grooves with a pitch<br>
corresponding to the voltage in between the turns; forming a first layer of the<br>
winding in a first disk by providing a superconducting tape having a width equal<br>
to that of the grooves and passing the tape through the grooves of the stiffeners<br>
in a circular form; forming a second layer in a second Disk by forming the<br>
stiffeners in a circle, the top and bottom rings being concentric to the first layer;<br>
forming further layers by repeating the steps of forming the first and/or second;<br>
layer, and stacking all the formed disks one above the other such that a tape end<br>
of the first disk is sandwitched along with the tape end of the consecutive disk<br>
thereby producing a LV-wingding stack; configurating a HV-winding stack by<br>
forming a plurality of disks and stacking the disks one above another, the HV-<br>
winding stack being concentric to the LV - winding stack; and immersing the<br>
winding stacks in a container filled with liquid nitrogen so that the<br>
superconducting tape of the coil remains in direct contact with the liquid<br>
nitrogen.<br>
Thus, the disk winding with superconducting tape according to the invention is<br>
efficiently cooled and reduce the installed capacity of the existing cooling means.<br>
Disk winding with superconducting tape ensures better voltage distribution for<br>
high voltage transformer requiring less insulation and reduced electrical stresses.<br>
Disk winding is a continuous winding in a disk starting from one end layer to<br>
another without joints. Disks are stacked one above the other. Connection from<br>
one disk to another disk will be with copper strips.<br>
One stack of disk is used for LV winding and other stack for HV winding which<br>
makes it a compact system.<br>
In the present method of disk winding, superconducting tape is surrounded by<br>
liquid nitrogen except for the small part sitting in the groove of stiffener thereby<br>
achieving better and faster cooling.<br>

material.<br>

DETAIL DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION<br>
Two insulated rings (1,2) with a plurality of stiffeners (3) forms a single disk<br>
(Dl). For making a first layer (4) of winding in a disk (Dl), the stiffeners (3) are<br>
joined to the top and bottom circular rings (1,2) with several non magnetic<br>
insulated screws (not shown) to form a circle. The stiffeners (3) have several<br>
grooves (5), each equal to the width of a superconducting tape (6) with a pitch<br>
to be decided by the voltage in between the turns. The superconducting tape (6)<br>
runs through the grooves (5) of the stiffeners (3) around the stiffeners (3) in a<br>
circular form.<br>
After completing the first layer (4), the stiffeners (3) of the second layer (7), are<br>
joined in a circle to top and bottom rings (1,2) concentric to the first layer (4)<br>
and second layer (7) is laid in the grooves (5) and carried out and so on for the<br>
remaining of the HV layers. Distance between the layers (4,7) is predetermined<br>
considering the insulation between the layers (4,7) and dielectric strength of the<br>
liquid nitrogen.<br>
The above disks (Dl) are stacked one above the other to form a LV-winding<br>
stack (8). A tape end (6) the (Dl) of the (Dl) disk is sandwiched along with the<br>
tape end (6) of a consecutive disk (Dl) in copper strip connected to the body of<br>
the disk.<br>
Similarly for HV winding, the disks (D2) are produced, stacked one above the<br>
other, and joined concentric to the LV disk stack winding to form a HV-winding<br>
stack (9).<br>
The LV and HV winding tack (8, 9) are immersed in a liquid nitrogen in a<br>
container. The liquid nitrogen is in direct contact with the superconducting tape<br>
(6) of the whole winding (8, 9).<br>
Circulation of the liquid nitrogen is much better in the invented case as there is<br>
no barrier for the liquid nitrogen to circulate thereby achieving an efficient and<br>
uniform cooling.<br>
Holes in the rings are used for connecting the stiffeners to the plate. Holes of<br>
adjacent layers of LV and HV windings are segregated.<br>
Stiffeners give the mechanical support to the weak superconducting tape. Depth<br>
of groove can be changed depending upon the no. of parallel superconducting<br>
tape.<br>
Distance between the LV and HV layer is as the calculated values of design for<br>
getting design parameters of the transformers. Disk winding helps in reducing<br>
the electrical stresses and level of insulation.<br>
The innovated disk winding is lighter in weight, less in volume, and reducing<br>
initial cooling of coils. The voltage distribution will be better than the prior art<br>
layer winding, and reduces the insulation and electrical stresses.<br>
It is comparatively cheap to manufacture and easy for maintenance to replace<br>
faulty coil. Cooling is uniform and efficient reducing the cost of installed cooling<br>
capacity. Each disk winding is made from continuous length of a superconducting<br>
tape with joint reducing the unnecessary joint losses.<br>
For passing large currents parallel conductors can be used by making grooves,<br>
having double the thickness of the superconducting tape.<br>
