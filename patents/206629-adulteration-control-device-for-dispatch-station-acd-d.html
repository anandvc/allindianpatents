1.	Title of Invention:<br>
Adulteration Control Device for Dispatch Station "ACD-D"<br>
2.	Field of Invention:<br>
The present invention relates to Adulteration Control Device for Dispatch Station "ACD-D". The device can be used in any field where problem of mixing / adulteration is encountered. Particularly so in the field of petroleum products like mixing of non-standard products in the standard products supplied by the Petroleum Companies.<br>
Adulteration is a major problem for these industries. "ACD-D" addresses this problem on the dispatch station side, by way of interacting intelligently with the data inputs from various devices on the field and correlating it with the dispatch station data to generate desired alerts, logs, MIS reports etc.<br>
3.	Background of the Invention:<br>
The invention addresses the major problems of getting the information about the adulteration instantly i.e., on real time basis and without interference from any human element.<br>
Earlier the adulteration detection was possible only by way of a lucky tip-off or by way of reconciling historical data. The historical data can be and is manipulated by the interested parties and the action therefore could not be taken. Hence no effective real time adulteration control device exists currently.<br>
The invention addresses these problems and informs the concerned official(s) instantly, if there is any adulteration material added to the storage tanks, and this it does without any human intervention, thus addressing the most difficult hurdles of human manipulation, and timely information.<br><br>
Objects of Invention:<br>
The Principle object of the present invention is to restrain and identify cases of adulteration and provide information to concerned officials / persons on real time basis by way of continuous intelligent interaction between the retail sale point and the dispatch station using convergence of instrumentation, software, hardware telecommunication technologies to achieve the desired results and keep the system functional on real time basis devoid of any human intervention thus eliminating possibility of tampering / manipulations.<br>
Further objects of the invention:<br>
■	To reconcile all the receipts at the Retail end with dispatch station on real time basis and to generate alerts for any mismatch and send it to the specified recipients.<br>
■	To interface with the system software of the dispatch location and process necessary information for alerts / data logging.<br>
■	To generate randomly passwords on daily basis for preventing tampering.<br>
■	To deploy various methods to keep the system tamper proof and maintain the integrity.<br>
■	To have a pollution free environment by way of providing standard fuels to motor vehicles.<br>
■	To get better efficiencies for motor vehicles by way of providing standard fuels.<br>

5.        A Summary of Invention:<br>
Invention aims to restrain and identify cases of adulteration and provide information to concerned officials / persons on real time basis by way of continuous intelligent interaction between the retail sale point and the dispatch station using convergence of instrumentation, software, hardware telecommunication technologies to achieve the desired results and keep the system functional on real time basis devoid of any human intervention thus eliminating possibility of tampering / manipulations.<br>
Typically, the Gasoline/HSD/LDO all petroleum product selling units are known as Retail Outlets / Gas Stations / Petrol Pumps etc.<br>
The adulteration occurs at these places by way of addition of non-standard fuel to the storage tank, which is later on dispensed through the dispensing unit to the vehicles, which come for refueling.<br>
In principle the adulterant has to go through the storage tanks to be sold to the customer. Hence, we propose to control these tanks by way of convergence technologies (Software, instrumentation, telecommunication etc.) and by connecting them with the dispatch station / dispatch location system on real time basis to detect any non-standard product coming from the illegal source.<br><br>
ACD-D addresses this problem on the dispatch station by way of interacting intelligently with the data inputs from various devices on the field and correlating it with the dispatch station data to generate desired alerts, logs, MIS reports etc.<br>
6.        Detailed Description of the invention with reference to the drawings:<br>
According to this invention, this method of apparatus consists of convergence of technologies like instrumentation, software, hardware, telecommunication etc. Drawing No. 1 shows Adulteration Control Device for Dispatch Station "ACD-D" in constructional diagram.<br>

(4)    Authentication Module:<br>
This module permits only authenticate users to logon the system, every data retrieved or collected from the RO module is first authenticated and then it is send for further processing. The modules are responsible for changing the password of ACD-R all across RO randomly.<br>
ACD-D SOFTWARE:<br>
This document describes the modules in the ACD-D software; it explains every module and their functionality in brief.<br>
ACD-D is divided in two parts.<br>
1.  ACD-D software	2. ACD-D hardware<br>
ACD-D software works in synergy with ACD-D hardware. Every data received from Retail Outlet is collected by ACD-D Hardware, which sends this data for processing to ACD-D Software. This document describes about the ACD-D Software part.<br>
ACD-D Software modules: ACD-D consists of mainly three modules.<br>
1.	ACD-D Client &amp; ACD-D message processor.<br>
2.	Management Information System.<br>
3.	Communication Unit Interface Layer.<br>
(1)    ACD-D Client &amp; ACD-D Message Processor.<br>
ACD-D Client provides the way to the user to interact with ACD-D System. Logically Client is divided into two modules user authentication &amp; authorization and user interface for activities. The details of each module are given below.<br><br>
1<br><br>
User authentication &amp; authorization:<br>
This module will authenticate the user during log-on and authorizes the user for the set privileges. The module provides the facility to create the users. As per requirement the privileges of the users can be altered. Log is maintained to keep track of all the users who use the system. In short following functions are taken care by the module.<br>
■	Authenticating and authorizing users.<br>
■	Creating and altering users.<br>
■	Maintaining log of activities.<br>
■	User interface for activities.<br>
The various activities that can occur during usage are grouped in to two, activities related to data and activities related to communication.<br>
Client is provided with the required data entry screens to maintain the master and transaction data, which includes;<br>
■	Depot/Terminal details.<br>
■	Personnel data.<br>
■	Product details.<br>
■	Retail Outlet details.<br>
■	ACD-R configuration details.<br>
■	Retail Outlet wise tank details.<br>
■	Retail Outlet wise dispensing unit data.<br>
■	Retail Outlet configuration data.<br>
■	Retail Outlet wise dispatches.<br>
Client also includes the screens to communicate with retail outlets. It is possible to make the request for following details;<br>
■	Current ACD-R configuration.<br>
■	Modify ACD-R configuration.<br>
■	Current dispensing unit reading.<br>
■	Current tank reading.<br><br>
■    Request for backup logs.<br>
ACD-D Message processor:<br>
This is background process that doesn't need any user interaction. At Retail Outlets ACD-R are configured to send data messages to terminal / depot. ACD-D Message processor is responsible for parsing these messages and store in database. The various data messages that need to be parsed are as follows:<br>
■	Fuel addition.<br>
■	Sales Log.<br>
■	Backup Sales Log.<br>
■	DU log.<br>
■	Backup DU log.<br>
■	Request Sales log.<br>
■	Request DU log.<br>
■	Exception Log.<br>
■	Backup exception Log.<br>
■	Configuration.<br>
The message processor keeps on looking for non-conformance against fuel addition message data and invoiced data for the retail outlet. On non¬conformance the alert will be generated. Alert will be communicated to concern person.<br>
To protect the tampering of ACD-R message processor will generate the random password. Every week new password will be remotely configured.<br>
In addition to activities mentioned above, message processor archives the data every day for last seven days safeguarding against loss of data.<br>
In short the message processor will carry out following activities;<br>
■	Retail outlet message data parsing.<br>
■	Non-conformance alert.<br><br>
■	Archiving log data.<br>
■	New password configuration.<br>
(2)    Management Information System (MIS):<br>
The data received from each of the RO can be analyzed for different purposes using MIS module. Data reconciliation is also available for dispensing units. The below mention MIS is available in data report format and different chart format.<br>
Retail Outlet wise tank analysis:<br>
The analysis can be done on tanks/products. This analysis is based on the data collected from the retail outlets. If tank data is not available for the particular day due to some unexpected reasons, then the reading for that day will be treated as reading with exceptions, so that the correct analysis can be possible on the available data.<br>
Variance report - dispensers vs. tank:<br>
ACD-D automatically gathers information from the meter readings; deliveries from the dispensing unit and daily sales from the tank. It reconciles the total at the end of the day. Variance report shows sudden losses and short deliveries form the dispensing unit.<br>
Variance report - dispatches vs. receipt:<br>
It is possible to capture information on the dispatches, but the option of integrating with the existing system is also available (as most of the terminal have their own dispatching software). Every dispatches of the product to retail outlet will reply back with the automatic receipt. This report can display any non-conformance, if found in the dispatches and receipt.<br>
Alert raised:<br>
If there is non-conformance in dispatches and receipt, then software will send alert in the form of wireless data messages / e-mail / fax to the configured recipient in the database. Every time the alert is send, it will<br><br>
be logged by the system. This report will help user in tracking, when the alert was raised, to which concerned officer the alert was sent etc.<br>
Exception raised:<br>
Every exceptions like dispensing unit not responding, tank gauging probe not responding or frequent power failure etc., are reported to ACD-D software by the (ACD-R) Communication Unit installed at Retail Outlet. This expectation data collected can be used for exception analysis.<br>
Retail Outlet details:<br>
If required, it is possible to get the information on the owner name, address, site address, latest stock, numbers of tanks and dispensing unit connected.<br>
Retail Outlet configuration:<br>
This will display the configuration of Communication Unit (ACD-R) installed at the Retail Outlet. Here user can see the latest configuration and can change it remotely on just pressing of the button.<br>
(3)    Communication Unit Interface Layer:<br>
The Communication Unit Interface Layer (CUIL) handles the hardware interfacing with the ACD-D hardware. Advantage of this layer is that it is scalable to cope up with communication traffic; this is possible due to modem pool solution. It is reliable as the system hardware is backed with battery and inverter, which doesn't lead to any data losses. It handles below mention functions.<br>
Receive message from retail outlets:<br>
Messages are collected from every retail outlet, and are stored in the received message queue; this queue is then processed by ACD-D software. Every message is processes on the first in first out (FIFO) principle.<br><br>
Send alerts to personnel:<br>
An alert that has to be sent to concerned personnel will be sent using this feature.<br>
Send messages to retail outlet:<br>
Messages that has to be sent to concerned retail outlet will be sent using this feature.<br>
Maintain in/out message log with date/time stamp:<br>
Every message received and send is logged with the time stamp as history of data.<br>
Modem stack support:<br>
Scale up option to cope up with communication traffic<br>
Backup support for PSTN line:<br>
If primary communication link fails, then this layer will automatically shift to backup support of PSTN line. This will help the system to work round the clock.<br>
Configuration of communication server User Interface:<br>
This is used to configure the ACD-D hardware. Parameter required for communication between ACD-D software and Hardware can be configured using this feature.<br>
Communication log status:<br>
Pending or not communicated message status can be found using this feature.<br><br>
