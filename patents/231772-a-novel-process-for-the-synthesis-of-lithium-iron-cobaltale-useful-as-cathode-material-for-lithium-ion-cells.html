				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The presents invention relates to a novel process for the synthesis of lithium iron cobaltate, useful as battery cathode material for lithium ion cells.<br>
The present invention relates to the preparation of lithium iron cobaltate (LiFe0.5 CO0.5 O2) a composite, which is very useful for high voltage lithium reversible cells and can be prepared by mixing oxides of ferric, cobalt with lithium hydroxide by heating together all in solid state condition. LiFe0.5 CO0.5 O2 is a reversible cathode material useful for high voltage cells of lithium in non-aqueous, polymer electrolyte and solid state cells.<br>
The object of this invention is to synthesis LiFe0.5 CO0.5 O2 under suitable solid state reaction method which obviates the defects and draw backs hither to known in other methods of preparation of this compound from already known procedure in literature.<br>
CO0.5 O2 compound is a hexagonal material is well known from 1999 as a good battery cathode for reversibility in non-aqueous solutions. This compound can be prepared by a co-precipitation method in which LiOH, Fe(OH)3 and Co(N03h were used [M.Tabuchi, K.Ado, H.Sakaebe, A.Hirano, and R. Kanno, J. Mater. Chem 9 (1999) 199]<br>
In the above procedure available in the literature some disadvantages were observed. They are as follows :-<br>
1.	Phase impurity<br>
2.	Longer duration ofthermal preparation<br>
3.	PH control<br>
4.	Several steps of preparation<br>
The main object of this patent invention is to formulate a new procedure for the synthesis of a novel paste procedure for the synthesis of LiFe0.5 CO0.5 O2 cathode material for reversible lithium ion cells which obviates the draw backs of the known methods.<br>
Further the object of this invention to ensure good cycliability with lithium based compounds and to replace partially cobalt by other materials like Fe and get better results in voltage when a cell is assembled.<br>
Still another object of this invention is to use glycerol as a binding agent to make an informally homogeneous mixture which permits even reaction to occur and their by any side or partial reaction is prevented.<br>
Yet another object of this invention is to prepare lithium iron cobaltate (LiFe0.5CO0.5O2) from mixture hydroxide of lithium and oxides Fe and Cobalt.<br>
Accordingly, the prevent invention provides a novel process for the synthesis of lithium iron cobaltate, useful as battery cathode material for lithium ion cells which comprises: heating a paste, prepared by mixing lithium hydroxide with oxides of cobalt and iron 1:1:1 respectively in glycerol and flux to a temperature up to 800°C for a maximum period of 12 hours, cooling the above product to get lithium iron cobaltate (LiFe0.5CO0.5 02).<br>
In an embodiment of this invention the temperature of preparation may be in the range of 600°C to 800°C.<br>
In another embodiment of this invention glycerol is used as a binding agent.<br>
Yet in another embodiment of this invention urea, ammonium nitrite, ammonium formate, succinic acid, formamide may be  used as precursors.<br>
A novel method of preparing this compound viz., LiFe0.5Co0.5O2 was carried out by uniform mixing of oxides of Fe and Co with LiOH and this mixture was made into a paste by adding necessary quantity of glycerol and the paste was calcined at 750°C continuously for 12 hrs in a furnace. The prepared product was subjected to x-ray analysis. The product was found to be in single phase.<br>
The present invention, describes the method of synthesis of cathode material for a secondary battery, by heating a paste prepared by mixing fine particles of LiOH, Fe2O3 and(Co3O4)  in glycerol. The paste was initially heated slowly in a furnace to evaporate off glycerol in order to get a dried mass at 200 - 250°C. This dried mass was then continuously heated to 800°C for 12 hrs. The compound formed was slowly cooled to room temperature and was ground well and then examined for its particles size, colour and structure. It was found that the prepared sample was brown in colour and was homogenous, X-rays analysis confirmed the formation of LiFe0.5Co0.5 O2 according to Fig. 1.<br>
The present invention describes a novel paste procedure for the synthesis of LiFe0.5Co0.5O2 cathode material for reversible lithium ion cells<br>
which comprises of heating hydroxide of lithium and oxide Fe and Cobalt for the preparation lithium iron cobaltate. The above mixture was ground well with a pestle &amp; mortar to get a fine powder. This powder was mixed with small quantities of glycerol and was ground well to get a paste which was transformed into a porcelain / ceramic crucible and then was slowly heated to 200°C initially &amp; then was strongly heated to 800°C for 12 hours. The resultant product was cooled slowly and then examined it by x-ray to conformity purity &amp; identity (the composites of the mixture of Li: Fe : Co is in the molar ratio of 1 : 1 : 1.<br>
The novelty of this process lies in the follqwing aspects.<br>
This method yields pure products without undergoing partial reactions or side reactions.<br>
The other procedure know is cumbersome and needs several steps where as this process needs only one step.<br>
Excess of flux addition has no deleterious effect on the product.<br>
The following advantages are claimed in this invention for the preparation of LiFe0.5Co0.5O2<br>
An uniform homogeneous mixture of the compounds viz., oxides of ferric and cobalt which LiOH were made into a paste to get a product of high purity.<br>
Glycerol was used as a solvent for biding the oxides viz., ferric and cobalt with LiOH for making a paste of required consistency. The addition of glycerol enhanced the quality of the product to very fine size.<br>
The addition of flux (urea) / excess addition of glycerol (solvent) as a binding material for oxides does not change the colour or quality of the end product.<br>
The following examples are given by the way of illustration and should not Beconstrued the scope of this invention.<br>

The paste was then heated initially to 200°C and strongly heated to 800°C and maintained the temperature for 12 hours. The product formed was cooled to room temperature and was then examined by x-ray to identify the product and its purity.<br>
