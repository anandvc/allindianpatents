				<td>The present invention relates to antibody with a specificity for truncated forms of human tau protein and a kit thereof.<br>
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the.most common chronic neurodegenerative disorder which is characterized chmcany by a progressive and irreversible loss of cognitive and behavioral func-tion. The disease can persevere for over 10 years, advancing from mild symptoms to extremely severe manifestations. AD afflicts approximately 10% of the population over the age of 65 and 20% of the population over the age of 80. As a result of growing of Western societies, the-number of persons afflicted is rising: already there are five million sufferers in the USA alone and by the end of the year 2000, there will be roughly 18 million people with dementia in the world. Of these, it is thought, that about two third of cases, i.e. 12 million, will be Alzheimer's disease. It is the fourth largest killer in the Western world after the heart diseases, cancer and strokes. The number of people with dementia is rising quickly. By 2025, there will be twice the number of people with dementia in the developed world as there were in 1980. The cost to the society for looking after the sufferers is enormous. For example, the costs to the US society for diagnosing<br><br>
and managing AD, primarily for custodial care, is currently estimated at US$ 80 billion annually. Currently, neither presymptomatic diagnostic test nor cure for AD is available: The disease is therefore clinically diagnosed after appearance of symptoms primarily by exclusion of other forms of dementia. Accumulation of the classical hallmarks, senile (neuritic) plaques and neuro— fibrillary tangles (NFT) in the AD brains, observed 93 years ago by the Bavarian psychiatrist Al-ois Alzheimer in 1907, still remain the neuropathologieal characteristic of AD.<br>
The common denominator of infracellular neurofibrillary structures (neurofibrillary tangles, dys— trophic neurifes, aiid heuroptrmreads) are paired helica filaments (PHFs). The major protein<br>
subunit of the PHF.s is microtubule associated protein tau in abnormally hyperphosphorylated form (Grundke-Iqbal et al., 1986; Wischik et al.,1988 a,b). Neurons with neurofibrillary changes degenerate, and the degree of this degeneration directly correlates with the degree of dementia in the affected individuals (Blessed et al., 1968).<br>
Normal tau is a microtubule associated protein that distributes mainly to axons. Tau protein is taking part in modulating the assembly, spatial organization and behavior of microtubules (MT) in neurons.and probably glial cell bodies (Drewes et al., 1998; Drubin and Kirschner, 1986; Lo-Presti et al., 1995). Tau proteins are encoded by a single gene located .on chromosome. 17, but are detected as multiple isoforms in tissue extracts from adult brains (Goedert et al., 1989; Himmler A., 1989; Kosik et al., 1989). Heterogeneity of tau proteins is in part due to alternative splicing, giving-rise to six isoforms in the adult human-brain. These distinct isoforms differ by the pres-ence or absence of 29- or 58- amino acid inserts in the ammo-terminal region and by the addi-tion or deletion of a tandem repeat (which can be repeated.either 3 or 4 times) in a carboxy— terminal region of tau referred to as microtubule binding domain. This region is composed of im—<br><br>
perfect repeats of 31 or 32 amino acid residues. In humans, the smallest tau isoform cpntains 352 amino acid residues with three tandem repeats in the MT-binding domain and no amino terminal inserts, whereas the largest isoform contains 441 residues with four repeats and both amino ter-minal inserts. For simplicity, all numbering in this patent application refers to the longest human tau protein isoform, htau40, containing all inserts (441 amino acid long) according to Goedert et. al.(1989).<br>
A number of neurological diseases are known to have filamentous cellular inclusions containing microrubule associated protein tau e.g. Alzheimer's disease (AD), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), corticobasal degeneration (CBD), Pick's disease (PiD) and a group of related disorders collectively termed frontotemporal dementia with Parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17), amyotropic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), dementia pu-gilistica (DP), Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker disease (GSSD), Lewy body disease and Huntingdon disease (Dickinson et al., 1998; DiFiglia et al., 1997; Forno, 1986; Hirano and Zimmerman, 1962; Nishimura et al., 1995; Prusiner 1996; Reed et al., 1998; Roberts, 1998; Schmidt et al., 1996; Shankar et al, 1989; Spillantini et al., 1998). Although the etiology, clinical symptoms, pathologic findings and the biochemical composition of inclusions in these diseases are different, there is emerging evidence suggesting that the mechanisms involved in aggregation of normal cellular proteins to form various filamentous inclusions are comparable. It is believed, that an initial alteration in conformation of microtubule associated protein tau, that initiates generation of nuclei or seeds for filament assembly, is a key feature. This process can be influenced by the posttranslational modification of normal proteins, by mutation or deletion of certain genes and by factors that bind normal proteins and thus alter their conformation. The tau protein is very hydrophilic. It can be readily extracted from brain tissue or cultured cells. In comparison, filamentous tau extracted from Alzheimer's diseased brain tissues is relatively insoluble. Besides phosphorylation, insoluble and normal soluble tau differ in the extent of posttranslational modifications, which include glycosylation, glycation, ubiquitination and racemization (Kenessey et al., 1995; Ko et al., 1999; Mori et al., 1987; Wang et al., 1996; Van et al., 1994).<br>
The mechanism by which tau protein is modified to take part in filament formation in AD is unknown. Tau is one of the most soluble proteins known (Cleveland 1977 a,b; Lee et al. 1988) and therefore its aggregation in AD is particularly enigmatic. Phosphorylation of tau affects the potential of tau to form aggregates, producing either stimulatory or inhibitory effects, presumably depending on the site of phosphorylation (Crowther et al., 1994; Schneider et al., 1999). Many in vitro studies demostrate that in the presence of the reducing agent, dithiothreitol (DTT), unsaru-rated free fatty acids, RNA or glycosaminoglycans, normal tau can be transformed into filaments (Goedert et al., 1996; Kampers et al., 1996; Perez et al., 1996; Wilson and Binder, 1997). Fur-thermore, the process of filament formation can also be accelerated by the presence of cross-linked tau generated through oxidation at Cys322 (Schweers et al., 1995). The parameters that have been varied in different filament assembly studies have included tau protein concentration,<br><br>
pH, and ionic strength of the incubation is many fold higher than exists in the cytoplasm under physiological conditions. Examination of in vitro formed tau filaments by scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) showed that these filaments differ from native paired helical filaments (Ksiezak-Reding, 1998). In the absence of glycans or RNA, no PHF-like filaments are detectable in samples containing unphosphorylated or phosphorylated wild type tau; normal tau. Studies of chemically cross-linked, heparin treated tau indicate that heparin treatment induces conformational change in tau protein (Paudel and Li, 1999). Taken together the in vitro data suggest (a) that the microtubule binding domain is important for assembly of tau filaments; and (b) that formation of tau filaments requires conformational change(s) of tau. Simultaneously these studies show that none of tau modifications described, are alone capable to induce filamentous tau formations that correlate with clinical expression of Alzheimer's disease. Identification and description of factors important for the initiation of tau changes leading to filament formation in disease conditions would be important for the development of presymptomatic diagnostic markers and therapeutic agents to interfere the progression of tauopathies.<br>
An object of the present invention is therefore to provide a reliable drug target for early therapeutic intervention in Alzheimer's disease and other tauopathies. Furthermore it is desired to provide a specific monoclonal antibody capable of specific detection and interaction with this drug target. This antibody should not only be suitable for presymtomatic detection of the molecule but for inhibition and elimination of this molecule as well, hence being suitable for presymtomatic diagnosis, treatment and prevention of Alzheimer's disease and other tauopathies.<br>
These objects are addressed with the present invention which relates in one aspect to an antibody with a specificity to abnormal forms of tau protein which are conformationally different from normal tau, said antibody being non-specific for a normal tau protein. Such abnormal forms of tau proteins represent a novel family of molecules, intra- and extra-neuronally located soluble and insoluble, preferably abnormally truncated, forms of tau proteins, which are conformationally different from normal tau (Novak et al., 1991, 1993) It could be shown with the present invention that these conformationally different forms of tau proteins - which are called "tauons" within the present specification - are seeds, nucleation centers in a self-propagating process of filamen-tous tau formations that is correlative to clinical expression of Alzheimer's disease thus tauons are important therapeutic targets for Alzheimer's disease. The tauons according to the present in-vention may be abnormally truncated tau proteins. Biological activity of tauons can be inhibited in vitro and inside of neurons by the antibodies according to the present invention. These anti-bodies have a capacity to stain presence of tauons in presymtomatic stages I, II and III of AD, which makes them suitable for presymtomatic diagnosis of this disease. It is critical for the anti-bodies according to the present invention that only the conformationally different form of tau protein (i.e. the "tauon") is recognized by this antibody whereas the normal tau protein does not bind to the antibodies according to the present invention.<br><br>
Within the course of the present invention AD truncated forms of microtubule associated protein tau were purified to homogenity and shown to be a major part of filamentous tau isolations from Alzheimer's diseased neurons. The amino acid sequence data indicated that the backbone of tauons is indistinguishable from that of protein tau but tauons could be distinguished immuno-logically from normal human tau by the different conformation as revealed by the conformation specific monoclonal antibodies according to the present invention. Specific examples for such antibodies are the monoclonal antibody DC-11 which is produced by the hybridoma cell line which was deposited in the European Collection of Cell Cultures (ECACC) under deposit No. 00082216 and monoclonal antibody DC-1 I/I which is produced by the hybridoma cell line DC-1 I/I and was deposited in the ECACC under deposit No. 00082215. This family of monoclonal antibodies which is provided with the present invention is defined by recognition of tauon-spe-cific conformation without recognizing normal human soluble tau. The different conformation compared to normal human tau, was attributed pathologically to abnormal truncation at the N-terminus or at the C-terminus or at both termini of tau molecule in the samples tested so far from Alzheimer's disease patients. Interestingly, the different conformation was regardless of tau iso-form and level of phosphorylation. The indispensable pathological requirements for tauons to attain typical conformation is presence of prolin rich and microtubule binding domains and truncated flanking region(s). Furthermore tauons could be distinguished from normal human tau by their pathological activities, namely that tauons represent a seed, nucleation center, that initiates tau aggregation and tauons disassemble microtubules assembled from normal tau and tubu-lin. Tauons preincubated with antibodies according to the present invention, especially monoclonal antibodies of the DC-11 family, showed no diassemble capacity or assembled microtubules from normal tau and tubulin. Moreover, tauons cause upon microinjection to differentiated human neurons significant displacement of endogenous tau from microtubule bound tau fraction, retraction of neuronal processes and degeneration of the cells. If tauons are microin-jected together with monoclonal antibodies according to the present invention, no neurodegen-erative changes were observed in differentiated neurons. This shows that the antibodies according to the present invention, especially the DC-11 monoclonal antibodies, inhibit tauons activity in-traneuronally and therefore could be used as intracellular drugs (for example as therapeutic intra-cellular antibodies, intrabodies). Immunohistologically, as seen with the antibodies according to the present invention, tauons occur already in presymptomatic stages I, II and III in pre-a-neu-rons, in both the transenthorinal and enthorinal region of AD, therefore, after proper coupling of tracers, antibodies according to the present invention could be used for intravital presymptomatic diagnosis for AD.<br>
Preferably, the antibody according to the present invention exhibits a specificity of at least 50%, preferably at least 90% to the conformationally different form of tau ("tauon") compared to the antibody DC-11. Specificity may be tested by any" standard test available for detecting antibody's specificity, e.g. ELISA tests, radioimmuno-assays, atomic force microscopy with cantilever-bound binding partners, etc..<br><br>
Generally, all antibodies which are specifically reactive with the conformationally different tau protein, especially abnormally truncated forms thereof, but not with normal soluble tau are also included within the scope of the present invention.<br>
Preferably, the antibody according to the present invention is said to be "specifically reactive" with a molecule if it is capable of binding with a molecule to thereby couple the molecule to the antibody. The term "epitope" is meant to refer to that portion of an antigen which can be recog-nized and bound by an antibody. An antigen may have one or more than one epitope. An "anti-gen" is capable of inducing an animal to produce antibody capable of binding to an epitope of that antigen. The specific reaction referred to above is meant to indicate that the antigen will im-munoreact, in a highly selective manner, with its corresponding antibody and not with the multi-tude of other antibodies which may be evoked by other antigens.<br>
Especially preferred antibodies according to the invention are derived from deposited hybridoma cell lines DC-11 (ECACC deposit No. 00082216) and DC-1 1/I (ECACC deposit No. 00082215) exhibit high specificity and selectivity and will react with conformationally different form of tau ("tauon"), but not with normal soluble tau. Specificity may be tested by any standard test available for detecting antibody's specificity, e.g. ELISA tests, radioimmuno-assays, etc..<br>
"Antibody" as used herein is meant to include intact molecules and fragments thereof as well as synthetic and biological derivatives thereof, such as for example Fab, F(ab')2 an Fy fragments-free or expressed e.g. on the surface of filamentous phage on pIII or pVIII or other surface pro-teins, or on the surface of bacteria, which are capable of binding an antigen. Fab, F(ab')2 and Fv fragments lack the FC fragments of intact antibody, clear more rapidly from the circulation and may have less non-specific tissue binding of antibody. Furthermore Fv antibody (often called as minibody) can be easily engineered to carry on its C-terminus specific tracer and used for early intravital presymtomatic diagnosis of AD, since stage I, II and III of AD that is recognized by the antibodies according to the present invention is not associated with intellectual decline.<br>
Within the present invention, monoclonal antibodies or monoclonal antibody fragments are pre-ferred. Therefore, according to another aspect the present invention also relates to hybridoma cell lines producing a monoclonal antibody according to the present invention.<br>
The term "tau" as used in the present application refers to the longest isoform of human microtu-bule associated protein tau containing all alternatively spliced inserts as described in M. Goedert etal.,1989.<br>
According to another aspect of the present application the invention relates to an abnormally truncated form of tau protein which is a conformationally different form of tau protein, said con-<br><br>
formationally different form of tau protein specifically recognizeable by an antibody according to the present invention.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention is drawn to a novel family of molecules intra- and extraneu-ronally located soluble and insoluble abnormally truncated form of tau proteins which are con-formationally different from normal tau and are called "tauons".<br>
"Tauons" therefore are conformationally different forms of tau protein which are specifically recognized by the antibodies according to the present invention. Tauons .useful in the present invention comprise the sequence according to SEQ ID No. _and may be flanked by further amino<br>
acids (see SEQ IT No. 2, 3).The tauons coveniently are in The range from about 100 to 400 amino acids and represent truncated forms of tau protein in this range. The tauons according to the present invention may be abnormally truncated at the N- or C-terminus or at both termini (see Figs. 2-13). The term "abnormally truncated" as used herein refers to tau peptides ("tauons") identified in diseased neurons in AD with tauon specific monoclonal antibodies provided with the present invention.<br>
Abnormally truncated forms of human tau proteins - tauons - can be prepared by using any of numerous well known synthetic recombinant techniques. Briefly, most of the techniques which are used to transform cells, construct vectors, extract messenger RNA, prepare cDNA libraries, and the like are widely practiced in the art, and most practitioners are familiar with the standard resource materials which describe specific conditions and procedures. However, for convenience, the following paragraphs may serve as a guideline.<br>
The most commonly used prokaryote system for the production of recombinant proteins remains E.coli, however, other microbial strains may also be used, such as Bacilli, for example Bacillus subtilis, various species of Pseudomonas, or other bacterial strains. In such prokaryotic systems, plasmid vectors which contain replication sites and control sequences derived from a species compatible with the host are used. Commonly used prokaryotic control sequences include promoters for transcription initiation, optionally with an operator, along with ribosome binding site sequences.<br>
A wide variety of eukaryotic hosts are also now available for production of recombinant foreign proteins. As in bacteria, eukaryotic hosts may be transformed with expression systems which produce the desired protein directly, but more, commonly, signal sequences are provided to effect the secretion of the protein. Eukaryotic systems have the additional advantage that they are able to process introns which may occur in the genomic sequences encoding proteins of higher organisms. Eucaryotic systems also provide a variety of processing mechanisms which result in, for example, glycosylation, oxidation or derivatizatipn of certain amino acid residues, conforma-tional control, and so forth.<br><br>
Commonly used eukaryotic systems include yeast, insect cells, mammalian cells, avian cells, and cells of higher plants. The list is not exhaustive. Suitable promoters are available which are compatible and operable for use in each of these host types as well as are termination sequences and enhancers, as e.g., the baculovirus polyhedron promoter. As above, promoters can be either constitutive or inducible. For example, in mammalian system, the MTII promoter can be induced by the addition of heavy metal ions.<br>
The particulars for the construction of expression systems suitable for desired host are known to those in the art. For recombinant production of the protein, the DNA encoding it is suitable ligated into the expression system of choice, and the system is then transformed into the compatible host cell which is then cultured and maintained under conditions wherein expression of the foreign gene takes place. The tauons of this invention produced this way, are recovered from the culture, either by lysing the cells or from the culture medium as appropriate and known to those in the art.<br>
Correct ligations for plasmid construction can be confirmed by the first transforming a suitable host with the ligation mixture. Successful transformants are selected by ampicillin, tetracycline or other antibiotic resistance or using other markers depending on the mode of plasmid construction, as is understood in the art.<br>
The present invention therefore relates to a preparation of tauons, especially from human or re-combinant resources, being essentially free of other proteins, especially from normal tau proteins. Such preparations may be provided by procedures involving an immunbaffinity step using the antibodies according to the present invention. Preferably, the preparation according to the present invention contains more than 80% tauons, especially more than 95% tauons, of total protein.<br>
Further the present invention also relates to a kit for detecting tauons, abnormally truncated forms of tau protein, which are conformationally different from normal tau in a sample of Alzheimer's disease brain tissue or in a sample of a body fluid comprising an antibody according to the present invention and a suitable container for providing the sample. It is possible to provide the antibodies in a kit for detecting or isolating of tauons. With the help of antibodies according to the present invention tauon proteins may be detected and isolated from various sources including Alzheimer's diseased neurons of transenthorinal, enthorinal region and hippocampus. Tauons isolated in this way may be further used as immunogen for immunization e.g. of mice for construction of hybridomas producing specific monoclonal antibodies against tauons not recognizing normal full length tau. This method comprises identifying and releasing neurons from transenthorinal, enthorinal and hippocampal region of Alzheimer's diseased brain tissues into the solution preserving abnormal conformation of tauons.<br><br>
After preparation and purification, tauons are used as immunogens and injected subcutaneously to mice in monthly intervals. Spleens from these animals are used for construction of hybridomas producing monoclonal antibodies against tauons. These can be produced using well-established hybridoma techniques first introduced by Kohler and Milstein (see M. Kohler and C. Milstein, "Continuous Cultures of Fused Cells Secreting Antibody of Pre-Defined Specificity", Nature, 256, pp.495-497, 1975). After a sufficient long immunization, antibody-producing lymphocytes are obtained from the animal either from the spleen, lymph nodes or peripheral blood. Preferably, the lymphocytes are obtained from the spleen. The splenic lymphocytes are then fused with a myeloma cell line, usually in the presence of a fusing agent such as polyethylene glycol (PEG). Any of number of myeloma cell lines may be used as a fusion partner according to standard techniques; for example the P3-NSl/l-Ag4-l, P3-x63-Ag8.653 myeloma lines. The resulting cells, which include the desired hybridomas, are then grown in a selective medium, such as HAT medium, in which unfused parental myeloma or lymphocyte cell eventually die. Only the hybridoma cells survive and can be grown under limiting conditions to obtain isolated clones. The super-natants of the hybridomas are screened for the presence of antibody of that desired specificity, e.g. by immunoassay techniques using the antigen that had been used for immunization. Positive clones can then be subcloned under limiting dilution condition or on soft agar and the monoclonal antibody produced can be isolated. Hybridomas produced according to these methods can be propagated in vitro or in vivo (in ascites fluid) using techniques known in the art. Commonly used methods for purfying monoclonal antibodies include ammonium sulphated precipitation, ion exchange, chromatography, and affinity chromatography (see e.g., H. Zola et al., "Techniques for the Production and Characterization of Monoclonal Antibodies", in Monoclonal Hybridoma Antibodies: Techniques and Applications, J.G.R. Hurell (ed.), pp.51-52 (CRC Press 1982)).<br>
Preferably, the kit according to the present invention further contains means for detecting the binding event of said antibody binding to said conformationally different tau protein. Preferably secondary antibodies especially secondary antibodies which are specifically labeled. Also the magnetic beads technology may be used within the scope of the present invention as well as other protein identifying methods using antibodies. The method comprises identifying in a test sample from the person, tauon, which is abnormally truncated tau protein. "Test sample" as used herein refers to biological sample from the person that is suspected of containing tauons. Test sample can comprise brain tissue having abnormally truncated tau proteins, such as hippocampal tissue or frontal cortex tissue or, the test sample can comprise cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). In a preferred embodiment, the test sample comprises CSF and the protein identified is CSF-tauon. Identification of abnormally truncated tau proteins - tauons - conveniently comprises indentifying in the test sample antigens capable of binding with antibodies specifically reactive with abnormally truncated tau proteins - tauons - comprising the sequence (SEQ ID No. 1) and flanked by amino acids such that said tauons are in range from about 100 to 400 amino acids in length and characterized by tauon specific conformation different from normal soluble protein tau, or antibodies specifically reactive with abnormally truncated tau proteins - tauons - comprising the se-<br><br>
quence (SEQ ID No. 1) and flanked by amino acids such that said tauons are in range from about 100 to 400 amino acids in length and characterized by tauon specific.conformation different from normal soluble protein tau. The presence of a tauon indicates a disease associated with the accumulation of the tauons in AD patients and other sufferers with tauopathies.<br>
A further aspect of the present invention relates to a method for detecting an abnormally truncated form of tau protein which is conformationally different from normal tau in a body fluid of a patient comprising mixing said body fluid with an antibody according to the present invention, detecting the presence of a binding event between the antibody and the conformationally different tau protein (tauon) and optionally measuring the amount of conformationally different tau protein being bound to said antibody. The presence of a tauon indicates a disease associated with the accumulation of the tauons in a person including AD and other tauopathies. The body fluid of a patient may be any biological test sample from a person that is suspected of containing tauons. This body fluid can comprise brain tissue such as hippocampal tissue or frontal or a cortex tissue or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). In a preferred embodiment the body fluid comprises CSF and the protein identified is CSF-tauons.<br>
This identification of tauons can conveniently be acomplished by biochemical or cytochemical means or by enzyme immunoassays such as decribed in many manuals of immunoassay producers as it is understood in the art. When biochemical means are used preferably 0.01 to 10 g, especially 0.5 to 1 g, of tissue containing diseased tau protein is used, run on a gel and identified by Western blot. Such a technique is believed do be adequate in the absence of age matched controls which have been shown to be non-reactive with the antibodies according to the present invention. Cytochemical means, staining, has shown no reactivity with normal tissue.<br>
CSF from patients with AD and patients with non-AD neurological diseases as well as normal subjects were surveyed by ELISA to quantitate level of tauons. The CSF tauon level was significantly increased in AD patients as compared with that with patients with non AD neurological diseases and controls. In AD, the significant increase was found irrespective of age of onset, apolipoprotein E genotype and clinical stage. Western blots of AD CSF proteins reveal several imfnunoreactive bands with apparent molecular weight between 50 and 15 kD consistent with abnormally truncated tau proteins. These results indicate that CSF-tauons reflect that progressive accumulation of diseased tau caused by progression of AD.<br>
According to a further aspect the antibodies according to the present invention may be used for the preparation of drug for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease patients. The antibodies may be biotechnologically modified into single chain molecules equipped with targeting sequence able to deliver them into the neuroblastoma cells expressing tauons. Inside of the present AD cellular model, antibodies bind tauons and interfere with their pathological effects (sequestration of normal tau) and increase the degradation of abnormally truncated forms of tau protein. In vitro as-<br><br>
says (sequestration of tau protein, filament assembly, microtubule disassembly) with abnormally truncated tau proteins and their correlation with severity of Alzheimer's disease show that they are important drug targets.<br>

EXAMPLES<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
Preparation of the monoclonal antibodies of DC 11 family specific for tauons<br>
Preparation of soluble and insoluble tauons as antigens for immunization (Fig.l)<br>
For isolation of tauons from human AD brains, a new approach was developed which is partially based on the methods described by Kopke et al., (1993) and Greenberg and Davies (1990). Human brains, showing changes characteristic for I.-III. Braak's stage of AD with short post mortem delay (PMD) were selected. Blocks of the temporal lobe including the enthorinal and transenthorinal regions, amygdala and hippocampal region were selected. The tissue was dissected and immediately immersed into minimal essential medium (Gibco). Tissue was finely minced and pushed through a 150 urn mesh wire screen. At this stage the brain sample was divided into two aliquots: sample A and sample B.<br>
Sample A was further processed in 20 mM TRIS, pH 8, 0.32 M sucrose, 10 mM p-mercapto-ethanol, 5 mM EGTA, ImM EDTA, 5 mM MgSO4, 5 mM benzamidine, 10 mM glycerolphos-phate, 6 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 mM sodium fluoride, 5 ug/ml leupeptin, 1.5 ug/ml pepstatin and 2 ug/ml of aprotinin and centrifiiged at 25 OOO x g for 35 min at 4°C to remove cellular debris. The supernatant was then pelleted at 200 000 x g for 40 min. The resulting pellet was extracted with 8 M urea at room temperature for 70 min and spun at 300 000 x g for 45 min at room temperature. The supernatant was dialysed for 24 hrs against the 10 mM TRIS pH 7.6 with frequent changes and then dialysed for 24 hrs against 100 mM MES, 0.5 mM MgCl, 1 mM EDTA, 2 mM EOTA, 1 mM dithiotreithol, 0.75 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 50 mM NaF, pH 2.7. The precipitated proteins were removed by centrifugation at 200 000 x g for 40 min. The 200 000 x g supernatant was dialyzed against 25 mM MES, pH 6.4, 0.5 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM EDTA and 1 mM dithiotreithol and subsequently fractionated on Cellulose Phosphate column which was equilibrated with the same buffer. The column was loaded with 2 mg/ml of proteins and eluted with 20 ml of linear gradient of NaCl (0-1M) in equilibrating buffer. The proteins eluted with 0.1-0.8 M NaCl were evaluated by Western blotting and concentrated by speed vacuum apparatus.<br>
Sample B was put into 10 volumes of cold buffer (10 mM TRIS, 1 mM EGTA, 0.8 M NaCl, 10% sucrose, pH 7.4) in a glass homogenizer. After centrifugation at 27 000 x g for 30 min at 4°C, the supernatant was saved and the pellet was homogenized with the buffer and centrifuged at 27 000 x g for 30 min. The 27 000 x g supernatants from both centrifugations were combinedj adjusted to 1% (wt/vol) N-lauroylsarcosine and 1% (vol/vol) p-mercaptoethanol and incubated' at 37°C for 3 hrs on shaker. After centrifugation at 35 000 rpm for 30 min, the pellet was homogenized in 5 ml of homogenizing buffer supplemented with 1% mercaptoethanol and filtered<br>
through 0.45 urn filter. The filtrate was centrifuged at 35 000 rpm for 1 hr. The pellet was resus-<br>
pended in 50 mM Tris, pH 6.8 and extracted with 2.5% formic acid for 2 min and then centri<br>
fuged at 10 000 x g for 10 min to pellet insoluble material. The supernatant was dialysed<br>
overnight at 4°C against 10 mM Tris, pH 7.4 and centrifuged as previously. The resulting super<br>
natant (fraction II) was concentrated using speed vacuum apparatus and evaluated by SDS-<br>
PAGE followed by Western blotting. Pellet from the sample B after extraction with 2.5% formic<br>
acid containing insoluble tauons (fraction III) was saved and used for immunizations and dot as<br>
say. Tauons from fractions (I, II and III) were pooled and used as antigens (see Fig. 1) for immu<br>
nization of mice.	;<br>
Preparation of hybridomas producing family of DC-11 monoclonal antibodies<br>
Six weeks old Balb/c mice were divided into three groups, (A,B,C). The first two groups (A,B) were primed with 50 ug of antigen in complete Freund's adjuvant (Sigma) and boosted five times at three weeks intervals with 50 ug of the same antigen (Ag) in incomplete Freund's adjuvant. In the group A all doses were injected into foot pad and in the group B doses of Ag were administered subcutaneously. The third group of mice was injected only with one dose directly into the spleen in PBS (intrasplenic immunization) and one week after such priming were spleens used for fusion. Three days before the fusion, mice in group A and B were injected intravenously with 50 ug of immunogen in PBS. Spleen cells from immunized mice were fused with NS/0 myeloma<br>
cells according to the method of Kontsekova et al., 1988. 10 splenocytes were mixed with 2 x 107 NS/0 myeloma cells (ratio 5:1) and fused for 1 minute in 1 ml of 50% PEG 1550 (Serva) in serum free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% dimethyl sulphoxide. The fused cells were resuspended in DMEM containing 20% horse serum, L gluta-mine (2 mM), hypoxanthine (0.1 mM), aminopterin (0.004 mM), thymidine (0.016 mM) and gentamycin (40 U/ml) at a density of 2.5 x 10 spleen cells per well on 96-well plates. Cells were incubated 10 days at 37°C and growing hybridomas were screened for the production of anti-tauon specific monoclonal antibodies by ELISA and by immunohistochemistry.<br>
Anti tauons antibody screening by ELISA<br>
ELISA was used to detect monoclonal antibodies in hybridoma culture supernatants which were directed against tauons. As a solid phase tauons prepared as described above with a following modification were used. Pool of the speed vacuum concentrated tau from fractions was separated by electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gel and truncated forms of tau protein were recovered by electroelution according to the method by Donofrio et al., (1986) and evaluated by SDS-PAGE. Microtiter plates were coated overnight with abnormally truncated tau proteins (10 ug/ml, 50 ul/well) at 4°C in PBS. After blocking with 1% nonfat dried milk to reduce nonspecific binding, the plates were washed with PBS-0.05% Tween 20 and incubated with 50 ul/well of culture supernatant for 1 hr at 37°C. Bound monoclonal antibodies were detected with sheep anti-mouse<br>
Ig conjugated with horse radish peroxidase (DAKO). The reaction was developed with o-phen-ylenediamine solution as a peroxidase substrate and stopped with 50 ul 2 M H2S04. Absorbance at 492 nm was measured using a Multiscan MCC/340 ELISA reader (Labsystems). Readings at least twice of the value of the negative controls were considered positive.<br>
Positive cultures were further subcloned in soft agar according to the procedure of Kontsekova et al., 1991. Isolated subclones were re-screened for the production of specific anti-tauon monoclonal antibodies.<br>
Immunohislochemical screening ofanti tauon antibodies<br>
Monoclonal antibodies identified as positive in anti-tauon ELISA and negative on normal tau, were re-screened on AD brain tissues for their specificity as follows:<br>
The brains of patients with AD removed at autopsy were sectioned at 1 cm intervals in the coronal plate and stored at -20°C. The blocks of hippocampus, enthorinal, temporal, frontal, occipital and parietal cortex were fixed in 4% buffered paraformaldehyde at 4°C for more than 4 days. Series of frontal sections (50 urn) were cut on vibratome and stored in PBS (pH 7.0) at 4°C. Free floating vibratome sections were pretreated for 2-3 min with 98% cold formic acid, incubated with pre-immune serum in PBS/Triton X 100. The serum used was from the same animal species as that of secondary antibody. Incubation of sections was done with the monoclonal antibody positive in ELISA (as described above) for 60 min at 37°C.<br>
Incubation with the second biotinylated antibody (Vectastain Elite kit, Vector) was performed for 1 hr at room temperature. Immunoreactions were visualised with the avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex (Vectastain Elite kit, Vector) and 6 mg 3-3- diaminobenzidine- 4 HC1 (SIGMA), 250 mg NiCl2 (MERCK) in 10 ml 0.1 M acetate buffer (pH 6) with 100 ul H.,0.,. Reaction was terminated by washing the sections in PBS/ Triton (Kiss et al., 1988; Cuello et al., 1993, Thorpe and Kerr, 1994)<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
Quantitative determination of the abnormally truncated tau proteins (tauons) using family<br>
of DC-11 monoclonal antibodies<br>
Tauons were isolated as described above. The combination of monoclonal antibody DC 30 (recognizing both normal and pathological tau) and family of DC-11 monoclonal antibodies (specific for abnormally truncated tau) allows quantification of tauons in the tested 'samples prepared from AD-brains. Antibodies were purified from serum-free medium by protein A column chromatog-raphy. The wells of high-binding microtiter plate (Nunc) were coated with mixture of DC-11 monoclonal antibodies at a concentration of 10 ug/ml (50 ul/well) in PBS overnight at 4°C. Non-<br><br>
specific binding in wells was saturated by adding 200 ul of 1% nonfat dried milk in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for 60 min at room temperature. The plates were washed 3 times with PBS-0.05% Tween 20 (v/v). The serially diluted standards containing recombinant tauons at concentrations ranging between 100-1000 pg/ml in PBS were added, as well as the test samples containing AD-tauons in amount of 50 ul. After incubation for 60 min at 37°C, plates were washed and the horse radish peroxidase conjugated antibody DC 3O diluted 1/5000 in PBS was added (50 ul/well) for 60 min at 37°C. After a final washing, 50 ul of orthophenylendiamine solution and 0.003% H2O2 were added to wells and plates were incubated in dark for 20 min. The reaction was stopped with 50 ul of 2 M H2SO4. Absorbance at 492 nm was read in ELISA reader Multiscan MC344 (Labsystems, Finland).<br>
The standard curve for recombinant tauons was constructed from the obtained values and the corresponding concentrations of tauons in tested samples were determined from the standard curve.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
Detection of tauons by Western blotting using monoclonal antibody DC-11.<br>
Purified recombinant full-length human tau and abnormally truncated tau proteins - tauons, were loaded on 5-20% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gels and run under denaturated conditions according to Laemmli (1970). After SDS-PAGE, the transfer on polyvinyl difluoride membrane (Milipore) was carried out in 10 mM CAPS buffer pH 12 for 1 hr at 350 mA with cooling. After blotting, the membrane was washed in PBS and blocked with 1% dried nonfat milk in PBS for 1 hr at room temperature. Transferred proteins were incubated overnight at 4°C with monoclonal antibody DC-11. After washing with PBS-0.05% Tween 20 (v/v), rat anti-mouse immuno-globulin labeled with horse radish peroxidase was used at a dilution 1/1000 and incubated 1 hr at room temperature. The membrane was then washed four times in PBS-Tween 20, developed with substrate solution (12 mg 4-chloro-l-naphtol, 4 ml methanol, 16 ml PB, 0.03% v/v H2C*2) and the reaction was stopped in H 0. Results indicated, that the antibody DC-11 recognized solely abnormally truncated tau - tauons, by contrast the monoclonal antibody DC 30 is pan tau antibody recognizing universally all known tau isoforms from many species (human, monkey, cow, pig, rat, mouse), regardless of their state of postranslational modifications.<br>

Free floating vibratome sections were pretreated for 2-3 min with 98% cold formic acid, incubated with pre-immune serum in PBS/ Triton X 100. The serum used was derived from the same animal species as that of secondary antibody. Sections were incubated with first peroxidase conjugated monoclonal antibody DC-11 at a dilution 1:1000 in blocking solution (5% horse serum, PBS, 0.1% Triton) for 60 min at 37°C, developed in 0.06% DAB, 0.01% H2O2 in PBS (pH 7.2). Reaction was terminated by washing the sections in PBS/ Triton. Incubation of the same sections with second monoclonal antibody was done for 60 min at 37°C. Incubation with the biotinylated antibody (Vectastain Elite kit, Vector) was performed for 1 hr at room temperature. The reaction was visualized with the avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex (Vectastain Elite kit, Vector) and 0.06% 3-3- diaminobenzidine-4 HC1 (SIGMA), 0.01% H2O2, 2.5% NiCl2 (MERCK) in 0.1 M acetate buffer and was terminated by washing the sections in 0.1 M acetate buffer (Kiss et al., 1988; Cuello, 1993)<br>
Cotinterstaining with fast cresyl violet<br>
After finishing immunohistochemical staining, the sections were placed on glass slides and put into thermostat for 60 min at 56°C. After incubation slides were immersed in destilled water for 5 min, stained in fast cresyl violet solution for 5-10 min at 4°C, rinsed in water, and transferred to 96% ethanol until most of the cresyl violet staining was removed, cleared in xylen, and mounted with Entellan.<br>
Immunojluorescent staining<br>
Free floating vibratome sections (30 urn) were pretreated for 2 min with 98% cold formic acid, incubated with pre-immune serum in PBS/ Triton X 100. Sections were incubated with first primary monoclonal antibody DC-11 for 60 min at 37°C and then incubated for 30 min with a FITC-conjugated goat anti mouse secondary antibody (Immunotech) diluted 1:500 in PBS/Triton at room temperature according to standard methods used in the field. After washing with PBS, sections were incubated with TRITC-conjugated primary antibody for 60 min at 37°C and mounted in 0.1 % paraphenylendiamin/glycerol solution.<br>
EXAMPLE 5<br>
Microtubule assembly and microtubule binding assays with tauons<br>
Tubulin purification<br>
Tubulin was isolated from fresh pig brains, obtained from the local slaughter house, by temperature dependend cycles of microtubule polymerisation and depolymerisation, followed by phos-phocellulose(WatmanPll phosphocellulose) ion-exchange chromatography (Valee, 1986).<br>
Microtubule assembly assay<br>
Purified tauons (5 mM) were mixed with precleared purified tubulin (10 mM) and GTP (1 mM) in the assembly buffer (100 mM PIPES pH 6.9, 2 mM EGTA, 1 mM MgSO4) at +4°C. This tubulin concentration is below the critical concentration for spontaneous assembly (Black, 1987). Samples were pipetted into quartz cuvettes preheated to 37°C. The change of turbidity was measured spectrofotometrically in thermostatically controlled spectrophotometer (LKB) and recorded as change of OD    in 10 s intervals for a period of 30 min.<br>
J5U<br>
Microtubule binding assay<br>
Binding curves of tauons with microtubules were measured as described previously (Gustke, 1992). Purified tubulin was incubated at 37°C in the presence of GTP (1 mM) and taxol (20 uM) in the binding buffer (100 mM PIPES pH 6.9, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM MgSO4, 1 mM DTT) for 10 min. Microtubules were stabilized by taxol which does not interfere with the binding of tauons or normal tau protein and other MAPs, respectively (Valee, 1986; Wallis, 1993) thus eliminating the effect of microtubule assembly. Tauons were added in concentrations 2.5 mM, 5 mM, 7.5 mM, 10 mM, 15 mM, 20 mM, respectively. After centrifugalion for 35 min, 43 000 x g, 37°C the pellets were resuspended in P buffer (50 mM PIPES pH 6.9, 1 mM EGTA, 0.2 mM MgCl , 5 mM DTT, 500 mM NaCl). Supernatant and pellets were analyzed on SDS-PAGE gels (Laemmli, 1970), stained with silver (Bloom, 1987). The gels were scanned on HPScanJet (Hew-<br>
lett-Packard) scanner and analysis performed on a Macintosh computer using the public domain NIH Image program (developed at the U.S. National Institutes of Health and available on the Internet at http://rsb.info.nih.gov/nih-image/). The band intensities were converted to concentrations using the method of internal standards and calibration curves.<br>
EXAMPLE 6<br>
Preparation of recombinant tauons<br>
Recombinant truncated forms of tau protein were prepared using "Erase a Base System" (Promega) according to the technical manual. The system is based on exonuclease III specific digestion of inserted DNA starting from 5'overhang. The rate of digestion was uniform at constant temperature. The tau gene was cloned into pET17b vector through Ndel-EcoRI restriction sites producing pET/T40. To the C-end of the gene was added Kpnl restriction site and three stop co-dons in all three reading frames downstream of the Kpnl site. The EcoRI enzyme leaves 5'ends overhanging, the substrate for exoIII. Kpnl leaves 3'ends overhanging which are resistant to exoIII digestion. 1 ug of pET/T40 vector double digested with EcoRI, KpnI/NEB and ethanol precipitated were diluted in 20 ul IxExoIII buffer and digested by 80 u exoIII at 37°C /dig. rate 450 bases/minute. 2.5 ul samples were transferred after ExoIII addition at 30 s intervals into 7.5 ul S1 -nuclease mix/1.5 u S1 -nuclease for 1 sample on ice. The collected samples were incubated at room temperature for 30 min to remove remaining single stranded tails. Klenow DNA polymerase was used to make blunt ends. DHSalfa competent cells were transformed directly with ligation mixtures of the samples. The subclones were screened by Pstl-XhoI restriction and appropriate constructs were sequenced using T7- primer in pET vector.<br>
Expression, purification and quantification of recombinant tauons<br>
Tauons were expressed in E.coli BL21(DE3) (Studier, 1986). Single bacterial colonies were inoculated to 500 ml of LB AMP (LB medium, 100 ug/ml ampicillin). Bacterial cultures were grown at 37°C on rotary shaker until their OD60Q reaches 0.6-0.8 and then induced by adding IPTG (0.4 mM final concentration). After 3 hrs the bacterial cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 5000 g for 15 min at 4°C (Sigma 6K15, rotor 12 500), and pellet of the cells quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -70°C until further use. For cell lysate preparation, bacterial pellet was resuspended in buffer A: (20 mM PIPES pH 6.9, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM MgSO^, 2 mM DTT, 0.1 mM PMSF), the cells were disrupted by sonication on ice for 6 min and cell debris removed by centrifugation at 45 000 rpm, 15 min at +2°C (rotor TLA-12O.2, Beckmann Optima TLX). Supematants were filtered through 0.22 um filters (Millipore) and tauons were immediately purified by ion exchange chromatography on phosphocellulose (cellulose phosphate Whatman P11) column. After loading the sample the column was washed with 10 bed volumes of the buffer A. Tauons were eluted with 20 ml of a-linear gradient of NaCl (50 mM - 0.5 M) in the buffer A. The 1 ml fractions were collected and those containing proteins were identified on<br>
SDS-PAGE. Fraction containing tauons were pooled and dialysed against PBS 3 x 60 min at 4°C. Aliquots from the dialysate were vacuum dried (SpeedVac) and stored at -20°C. Recombi-nant tauons were quantified by PAGE, using serially diluted bovine serum albumine (BSA) as mass standard markers. The gel was stained by Coomassie blue, dried and the intensity of BSA and tau bands was calculated using Scion Image (Beta 3b, Scion Corp.). The calibration curve for BSA was constructed and used for quantification of tauons.<br>
EXAMPLE 7<br>
Isolation of tauons from human AD-brain<br>
For isolation of tauons from human AD brains a new approach partially based on the methods described by Kopke et al., (1993) and Greenberg and Davies (1990) was developed. Human brains, showing changes characteristic for I.-III. Braak's stage of AD with short post mortem delay (PMD) were selected. Blocks of the temporal lobe including the enthorinal and transenthori-nal regions, amygdala and hippocampal region were selected. The tissue was dissected and immediately immersed into minimal essential medium (Gibco). Tissue was finely minced and pushed through a 150 urn mesh wire screen. At this stage the brain samples were divided into two aliquots: sample A and sample B.<br>
Sample A was further processed in 20 mM TRIS, pH 8, 0.32 M sucrose, 10 mM p-mercapto-ethanol, 5 mM EGTA, 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM MgSO4, 5 mM benzamidine, 10 mM glycerolphos-phate, 6 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 mM sodium fluoride, 5 ug/ml leupeptin, 1.5 ug/ml pepstatin and 2 ug/ml of aprotinine and centrifuged at 25 000 x g for 35 min at 4°C to remove cellular debris. The supernatant was then pelleted at 200 000 x g for 40 min. The resulting pellet was extracted with 8 M urea at room temperature for 70 min and spun at 300 000 x g for 45 min at room temperature. The supernatant was dialysed for 24 hrs against the 10 mM TRIS pH 7.6 with frequent changes and then dialysed for 24 hrs against 100 mM MES, 0.5 mM MgCl, 1 mM EDTA, 2 mM EGTA, 1 mM dithiotreithol, 0.75 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 50 mM NaF, pH 2.7. The precipitated proteins were removed by centrifugation at 200 000 x g for 40 min. The 200 000 x g supernatant was dialyzed against 25 mM MES, pH 6.4, 0.5 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM EDTA and 1 mM dithiotreithol and subsequently fractionated on Cellulose Phosphate column which was equilibrated with the same buffer. The column was loaded with 2 mg of proteins and eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl (0-1 M) in equilibrating buffer. The proteins eluted with 0.1 -0.8 M NaCl were evaluated by Western blotting and concentrated by speed vacuum apparatus.<br>
Sample B was put into 10 volumes of cold buffer (10 mM TRIS, 1 mM EGTA, 0.8 M NaCl, 10% sucrose, pH 7.4) in a glass hombgenizer. After centrifugation at 27 000 x g for 30 min at 4°C, the supernatant was saved and the pellet was homogenized with the buffer and centrifuged at 27 000 x g for 30 min. The 27 000 x g supernatants from both centrifugations were combined,<br>
adjusted to 1% (wt/vol) N-lauroylsarcosine and 1% (vol/vol) p-mercaptoethanol and incubated at 37°C for 3 hrs while shaking on shaker. After centrifugation at 35 000 rpm for 30 min, the pellet was homogenized in 5 ml of homogenizing buffer supplemented with 1% mercaptoethanol and filtered through 0.45 urn filter. The filtrate was centrifuged at 35 000 rpm for 1 hr. The pellet was resuspended in 50 mM Tris, pH 6.8 and extracted with 2.5% formic acid for 2 min and then centrifuged at 10 000 x g for 10 min to pellet insoluble material. The supernatant was dialysed overnight at 4°C against 10 mM Tris, pH 7.4 and centrifuged as previous. The resulting supernatant was concentrated using speed vacuum apparatus and evaluated by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting.<br>
EXAMPLE 8<br>
Purification of normal tau from human, pig and cow brain tissues<br>
Tau was purified by the modification of the method of Lindwall and Cole., 1984. Brain tissue was homogenizated (1 mg/ml) in 0.1 mM MES, 0.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, 1 M NaCl pH 6.5 and centrifuged at 100 000 x g at 4°C for 90 min. The supernatant was made up to 0.5% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, heated at 100°C for 5 min and centrifuged at 20 000 x g at 4°C for 30 min. This second supernatant was brought to 45% saturation in (NH^SO^ and centrifuged at 20 000 x g as above and the resulting pellet was resuspended in MES buffer without NaCl. After precipitation with 2.5% (v/v) perchloric acid and a further centrifugation at 20 000 x g the final supernatant was dialysed against 5 mM Tris, pH 7.4 overnight at 4°C.<br>
EXAMPLE 9<br>
Sequestration and aggregation of normal tau into tangles of filaments by tauons<br>
Increasing amounts of normal tau (5-100 ug/100 ul) were mixed with fixed amount of tauons isolated from fraction 1(10 ug/100 ul). The reaction was performed in a final volume of 100 ml of binding buffer (100 mM MES pH 7.6 containing 2 mM EGTA, 2% bovine serum albumin, 0.5 mM MgCl, 1 uM aprotinin and 20 uM leupeptin). The mixture was allowed to interact for 45 min at room temperature, then overlaid on 150 ul of 80% sucrose in the binding buffer and centrifuged for 1 hr at 100 000 x g. The top 150 ul was removed and the remainder was sonicated for determining of interaction between tauons and normal tau by radioimmuno-dot-blot assay. The presence of tau in the sucrose layer indicates sequest ration of healthy tau by tauons.<br>

Cells were permeabilized for 5 min at room temperature in 0.2% Triton X 100 containing 80 mM PIPES, I mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, pH 6.6. Fixation of the cells was performed in 2% parafor-maldehyde in the same buffer for 15 min on ice. Tauons were detected by indirect immunofluo-rescence avidin rhodamine detection system (Sigma).<br>
Detection of early inhibition ofneuronal differentiation<br>
The cells were grown with the differentiation inducing factors. Level of differentiation was evaluated. The group of the cells harbouring tauons without antibodies had significantly impaired capacity to differentiate. However, group treated with mixture of tauons and antibodies differentiated to comparable level with the cells from control group treated with irrelevant protein.<br>
