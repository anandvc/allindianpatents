1. TITLE OF INVENTION<br>
PROPELLING SYSTEM WITH VERTICAL SHAFT FOR GENERATING POWER.<br>
2. (a) GANGULI Sushil Kumar, (b) HIG-II, 38, Deen Dayal Dham, Padra, Rewa, State of Madhya Pradesh, PIN-486 001, India, (c) an Indian national.<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br>
THE FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to wind power driven propelling system with a vertical shaft capable of generating high rotational torque at low wind speed and independent of direction of wind. More particularly the said system comprises semi-cylindrical curved main propelling blades along with auxiliary blades having pre-determined shape, diameter and height with a definite arc angle arranged in a pre calculated position on a base plate and a central cylindrical tube with spiral fins attached to it at particular disposition. The invention further relates to a generating unit comprising the said propelling system being operatively connected to dynamo or alternator by means of pulleys, gears, v belts and the like and adapted to generate power by converting the high rotational torque attained at low wind speed by the said system.<br>
BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ART<br>
The utilization of wind pressure as a power was recognized for doing different types of jobs from the very early days of human civilization. One of the popular forms was to use wind velocity to sail boats, ships. Later the use of wind power became extensive in Holland, United Kingdom and at different coastal areas of Europe.<br>
Sails made of wooden planks and flaps were used to operate windmills where wind velocity were very high. These sails were very large and heavy and used to operate yielding very low speed. These windmills were utilized for grinding corns, lifting water and for many other useful purposes.<br>
Realizing that the availability of the fossil fuel and oil reserves under the earth"s crust may one day get scarce, lead to search for alternative sources of energy. Solar radiation and wind power were identified as major sources of energy. While solar power at times gets restricted and the areas were to be selective, but wind power is always available at different heights over the earth"s surface according to the geographical features of the place and land.<br>
Many devices have been made to harness wind energy, out of which most popular is the horizontal type shaft driving axis with vertical type propelling blades. In this case all the blades faces the direction of wind flow. When the direction of the wind changes, the blades are also rotated to face the wind by moving a tail-piece or a radar. In this case the<br><br>
total assembly of the power generating devices are kept attached with the horizontal shaft making it heavy and difficult to operate. Very recently, however, aerofoil systems of blade were introduced which operate efficiently but at a very high wind speed which are to range from 25 Kms/Hr to 40 Kms /Hr or above. These blades are very long and run at lift and drag principle. Many units have been installed to form wind firm consisting of few hundreds of them where wind velocity is very high yielding thousands of kilowatts of power and are being supplied to the power grids of various national power distributing systems, such as in USA, Canada etc. In India also some attempts have been made and installed some of these units near the coastal areas having high wind velocity. But no attempts have been made anywhere to develop smaller efficient units with vertical shaft system for individual power consumption such as for a family or for a tiny village or a community who may be far away from big cities or localities and are not experiencing very high wind velocity all the times in a year. One reason, which is a major one, is that the development of a proper efficient propelling system at a lower wind speed was not worked out nor made available at an affordable cost, where the vertical type shaft system would be ideal.<br>
As expressed here before, the horizontal shaft propelling system have been developed properly which can operate at a high, as well as only at a given lower speed, which has the following disadvantages:<br>
1)	These systems need high mast and cannot operate below a minimum wind speed say 20 Kms /Hr to yield power. Below this speed the operating cost is very high as the system needs elaborate arrangement for installation and maintenance.<br>
2)	The generating and driving system remains attached to the shaft making it difficult to approach.<br>
3)	The propelling system need to rotate as the wind direction changes<br>
4)	For low speed the propelling blades need to be very long and number of blades also to be numerous making it top heavy.<br>
5)	Naturally all these factors are added to the cost making the system uneconomical.<br>
Against these the vertical shaft system would have been proper but: 1) As for present design half of the propelling blades are to remain inactive which however tries to exert equal and opposite force rendering the operation difficult.<br><br><br>
2)	Attempts have been made to construct fans with windows to eliminate reactionary pressure but number and sizes of the blades are to be more.<br>
3)	With these type of design the length of the mast also to be very high but efficiency gained will not be economical.<br>
As such many attempts have been made but none could bring forward a viable solution. In one case better result was on the offing but the same was not pursued further. In this case one Finnish engineer Mr. Savonious brought forward a design consisting of two semi cylindrical blades placed opposite to each other and about the vertical axis, each facing the concave side with a gap in between, allowing an air passage in between the blades. In this case air pressure on the blades was increased two folds and an increase in the efficiency was observed. But the system still did not become viable and was not pursued further.<br>
It has been now found that by increasing the number of main propelling blades and also introducing auxiliary blades in between and setting them in a particular configuration, where the blades are semi cylindrical type, and further allowing air vortex to drive curved fins placed at the centre, the force of the system can be increased to its maximum and much higher than hitherto experienced.<br>
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
Thus the object of the present invention is to provide a propelling system with vertical shaft adapted to operate at a very low wind speed<br>
Another object is to yield a high torque at the low wind speed giving the propelling system high rotational movement.<br>
Another object is to provide a propelling system in which the rotational movements are independent of direction of the wind.<br>
A further object is to provide a system which is cost effective and efficient in converting high torque generated at low wind speed into electric power.<br><br><br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION<br>
Thus according to main aspect of the present invention there is provided a wind power driven propelling system with vertical shaft adapted to generate high rotational torque at low wind speed and independent of direction of wind and a plurality of blades to be actuated and rotated by wind and translate the rotational movement to said vertical shaft said system characterized in that it comprises :<br>
i)        plurality of semi cylindrical , curved, vertical blades having predetermined<br>
configuration; ii)       said blades arranged in a particular disposition on a base plate; iii)      a central tube with plurality of fins in particular arrangement and placed on<br>
said base plate.<br>
According to a further aspect of the present invention there is provided a power generating unit comprising the said propelling system being operatively connected with dynamo or alternator by means of pulleys, gears, v belts and the like and adapted to generate power by converting the high rotational torque attained at low wind speed by the said propelling system.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION<br>
The blades are designed semi-cylindrical shaped with an inwardly inclined flap at the top and arranged in a pre-calculated position on a base plate (frame), such that the incoming force of wind flow impinging on the blades can get diverted (reflected) to strike on the adjacent blade or on the blades in succession and thereafter creates a cyclonic vortex at the centre of the assembly as well actuate a lift action on the blade.<br>
The system is designed such that center of the vertical axis of rotation is the main reference point.<br>
The diameter of centre tube with fins is "X", the reference circle diameter is to be "2 X", the diameter of curved blade is "4 X", the diameter of the arc of fins is "X", and the diameter of the circle enclosing outer periphery of blades (as base) is "6 X".<br><br><br>
The circumference of the reference circle is divided equally in as many parts as there are number of blades. Between two main blades one auxiliary blade is placed with equal spacing. The system can be made as large as possible till the Arc angle of the blades remains greater than 100 degree (the greater the angle, the more efficient is the blades performance). The height of the blade also can be increased or decreased to design a large or small generating system.<br>
While fixing the blades on the base frame (plate) first reference point is the centre point of the vertical rotational axis of the system. The second reference point is the intersection of the meridians of an equilateral triangle (for six blades i.e. 3 main and 3 auxiliary) inscribed in a circle. The centre point of circle and the point of intersection of meridians of the triangle shall coincide with that of the centre point of the rotational axis.<br>
For four blades, the reference for arranging the blades shall be a square. The intersecting point of the diagonals of the square shall coincide with that of the centre point of the vertical rotational axis. Here the number of auxiliary blades shall also be four to be placed between the main blades equally spaced. All other constructional features shall be similar to the six blade system (three + three).<br>
While designing the position of setting the blades on the base in respect to the reference circle or triangle or square or a polygon having arc angle more than 120 degree (for efficient performance) as per pre calculated dimensions to be kept in consideration.<br>
To utilize the force of cyclonic vortex a cylindrical tube with several turbo fins attached spirally on the tubes are kept fixed at the centre of the system. The spiral fins have upward tilt towards the front.<br>
The turbo fins as remain fixed spirally along the length of the centre tube, are to accept turbulent air pressure. The number of fins is equal to the number of all the blades together<br><br><br>
The number of blades and their sizes including that of turbo fins are selected considering the amount of power to be generated. As per general law a circle having its centre on the centre point of the vertical axis can be a circle of reference. The circumference of the circle is to be divided equally in as many parts as there are blades. According to this concept infinite number of blades can be placed on the circumference of a circle having infinitely large diameter.<br>
In practice, however, economic consideration needed to be taken into account while choosing the number of blades, their heights, Arc angle and number of turbo fins for designing a particular power generating unit.<br>
With this arrangement, force of air is repeatedly reflected within the blades and also pressure is applied on the turbo fins at the centre accelerating the rotational movement of the system increasing the force by about six times the force that would have acted on the blades when they would have been fixed radially and equally spaced around the circumferences of the base circle in normal way.<br>
The inner and outer surfaces of the blades as well as of spiral fins are highly glazed polished to allow the air to slide easily on the back side to create a low pressure to accelerate the intensity of the striking air front. The polished inner surface allows easy reflection of air without losing much of its kinetic energy.<br>
The top part of the system is partially kept closed to keep the moving air trapped for some time till its force loses its strength considerably and then gets pushed out by fresh incoming air flow, developing a reactionary force while going out..<br>
The semi cylindrical type light weight blades are made of light metal or plastic or synthetic materials or in combination of both. The base plate is then kept fixed on a metal pulley mounted on thrust and ball bearings. The drive system must be on frictionless thrust bearing and ball bearing. The pulley gets its rotational movement from the rotating blades and from the spiral fins. This is transmitted to the dynamo or the alternator for generating power.<br><br><br>
In the present invention the torque vis-a-vis the rotational force of movement is more than 4 to 5 times than that of the Savonious designed system. In the present system even a small movement of air can produce a rotational movement.<br>
The number of blades is selected according to configuration and in a manner without obstructing the air passage of each other. It is seen that the three sets of main blades are ideal but four sets of main blades also can be put into operation along with auxiliary blades as required. Further the introduction of spiral fins fixing around the centre tube and their numbers can also be selected according to the diameter of the tube say 3, 6, 12, 18 etc. Maintaining of proper and measured air gaps between the blades and between the edges of blades and fins around the centre are also equally important to create reflected and cyclonic action<br>
The invention is now described with respect to non limiting illustrative figures:<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF FIGURES:<br>
FIG-1<br>
In this case two semi cylindrical shell type blades a1 - a - a2 and b1 -b- b2 having centre as marked "1" and "2" are mounted vertically on a Base frame but at an offset position keeping gaps between the shells .Their concave sides are allowed to face each other and towards the centre point (axis "s" ).<br><br><br>
Air stream P1 entering through the gaps a1 and b1 between the two shells strikes against the concave wall of a1 - a - a2 gets reflected and emerges out as P3 impinging on the shell wall b1 - b - b2. The same stream of air again reflects to come out as P2. A small part of P3 divides as P4 and returns back to strike against a1 - a -a2 . Thus in both the cases while the air is coming in or going out produces reactionary force striking against the walls of both the shells in turn actuating an unidirectional rotational movement. These actions are independent of the direction of air flow in the atmosphere. The torque produced by these movements are considerably higher than the other systems to be experienced while considering the vertical shaft mechanism.<br>
Fig-2<br>
Three main semi cylindrical vertical blades a1 - a - a2, b1 - b - b2 and c1 - c - c2 along with three auxiliary semi cylindrical vertical blades a u1 - a u- au2 , bu1 - bu -bu2 and cu1 - c u - c u2 are mounted on a base plate along with the spirally constructed fins ( Y) six in numbers attached to a tube fixed at the centre made of FRP materials .The blades as well as the spiral fins on the centre tube are fixed on the Base plate by taking the reference of an equilateral triangle whose center (The meeting point of the three meridians) is to coincide with centre of the axis of rotation. The blades and fins with the tube are made of FRP/synthetic light materials. The main blades ai- a - a2 , bi - b -b2 and c1 - c - c2 have their centres as marked "1", "2" and "3" on the triangle as shown. The auxiliary blades also have their centres on the same points as could be seen in the figure. The blades are mounted facing each other"s concave sides and towards the centre of the rotating axis.<br>
In order to utilize the circular vortex created by reflected air in a more rational way and to increase the intensity of moving force further several longitudinal fins are kept mounted spirally on the periphery of a cylindrical tube (x) placed on the centre of the base. A sufficient gap is maintained between the edges of fins and the air blades to allow a channelized circular movement of air vortex to create a cyclonic force to move the fins. There are gaps between the blades symmetrically and accurately kept for allowing the air to flow freely inside. The stream of air (e) and (f) coming in strikes the wall of a 1 - a -a2 and au1- a u- au2 and reflects to strike at points (g) and (h). Moving forward the air stream impinges as (1) and (m) on the walls of    b2 - b - b1 and gets diverted as (P3 )<br><br><br>
and (n ) to strike on the wall of c2 - c - c1. From this points these streams move to join the circular whirlpool created around the centre.<br>
It can be seen that even the partial air flowing (q) and ( r ) out of the system exerts a reactionary thrust on the blade c2 - c - c1 and bu1 - b u- bu2. In this way all the blades and fins receiving air pressure from different points by moving air, actuates a very high rotational movement and singularly only on one direction irrespective of the direction of atmospheric air flow. Due to multiple reactive forces acting together on all the blades and fins at a time, the movement accelerated to a very high speed. Even the weak air being pushed by the fresh inflow of air contributes its part to develop a reactionary force while emerging out of the system.<br>
Fig-3<br>
Different position of blades along with the spiral fins with the centre tube with slight variation is shown. Its action is equal in intensity as fig-2.<br>
Fig 4:<br>
This propelling system is kept attached firmly to a pulley (a) at the base which is to be driven by the rotational movement of the blades and as well as of the fins acting together.<br>
The pulley (a) is made of metal plate having groove at the edge for fitting in B-section V-belt (b), the pulley is mounted on a thrust bearings (c) and ball bearing (d) to allow it to rotate smoothly around the fixed vertical shaft (o). The thrust bearing is to accept the vertical load during rotational movement.<br>
The V-belt from the pulley is led to be coupled with a smaller pulley (p) fixed on another vertical shaft (q). A bevel gear (r) is also attached to the same shaft (q) with the pulley on keyways. The bevel gear has larger diameter coupled with the smaller Pulley. A smaller diameter bevel pinion gear (s) is attached to the shaft of dynamo or alternator (t) to be driven by the bevel gear.<br>
The bevel gear of dynamo or alternator is driven by the bigger bevel gear which in turn is driven by the larger pulley with the fan blades (u) and the spiral fins(y) at the centre<br><br><br>
through the smaller pulley. In this way the input ratio at the prime moving stage is kept considerably lower.<br>
As an example a model was made having PCD 950 mm for larger pulley and 70 mm PCD of the smaller pulley which is coupled with the bevel gear having a PCD of 450   mm to drive pinion bevel gear having PCD of 37.5 mm.<br>
Considering the maximum RPM of dynamo or alternator is 3000, the input RPM of the<br>
bigger pulley attached to the blade shall become : 3000 / ((950/70) x (450/37.5)) = 18.42 RPM<br>
Thus for one revolution , if made by the blades in 3 Sees, then the final RPM to be reached by the alternator/dynamo shall be 3257 RPM apx. fulfilling the criteria of power generating condition. On the other side the torque requirement is   : I x a = ( mxRxRx2xπ   xf )/60 where m= mass of the pulley with the FRP blades, centre fins and gear. As per construction, in the above case the wt. of the pulley is 25 Kgs and of blades with fins are 50 Kgs, that of Bevel Gear is 8 Kgs. Then : torque of pulley = 75 x 0.5 x 0.5 x 2 x π   x 20/60 = 39.27 Kgm.apx torque of bevel gear = 8 x 0.225 x 0.225 X2XΠ  x 271.42/60 =11.511 Kgm The torque of generator = 32 Kgm apx. (For 1 KW) Therefore total torque is = 82.78 Kgm. Apx.<br>
Now the blades exerts pressure having velocity of 5 Kms / Hr. i.e. 1.388 Mtrs/Sec Diameter of blade = 1 Mtr., angle of the main blade 200° and that of auxiliary blade is 130 °, height of blade = 1.5 Mtr. Main blades = 3Nos. Auxiliary blade = 3 Nos.<br>
Wt of pressure exerted by six blades  = (   n     x 1 x 200 x 1.5 x 1.388 x 1.22 x x3/360) +( π x 130 x 1.5 x 1.388 x 1.22 x x 3/360) = 21.94 Kgm. Due to whirlpool action of the air movement on the fins and repeated striking on blades as per Fig -2 the increase of force has been considered only to be   4   times in a conservative way. As such   :<br>
Force = 21.94 x 1.388 x 4.0 = 121.80 Kgfm. (Required 82.78 Kgfm). Actual forces are better than the above calculated values. (Here the increase is taken 4 times for safety reason).<br><br><br>
Considering the density of air to be " 1.0 Kg" per Cubic meter accepting various atmospheric uncertain conditions the calculated force will become 99.83 Kgfm apx. even at 0.94 kgs Per cubic meter the force will be approx. 93.84 Kgfm.<br>
This shows that the system as invented is far more effective and better than all other adopted till now, to produce high torque at low wind pressure.<br>
Fig 5<br>
The fins on the centre tube are curved inwardly (xl) in a circular way and placed along the vertical length of the tube in a spiral form (x2). The circular vortex air movement strikes against these (p4) fins and starts moving upward following the path of the channel (p5) produced by the fins actuating a "lift" effect creating a pressure to move the fins backwards. At the same time a low pressure zone (p6) comes to exist at the back side of the curved fins.<br>
To make the blades and centre tube with fins light weight ,light metal or synthetic materials like polyester moulded fibre glass reinforced sheets or plastic materials can be used. The shapes of the blades and fins around the centre tubes are shown.<br>
The blades are shaped as semi cylindrical shells. The concave side of the blades shall be facing the centre axis. They shall be fitted in such a manner that the vertical edge of each blade shall extend up to the vertical centre axis of the adjacent blade keeping sufficient gap for air to pass through. Each one of the blade shall be placed symmetrically in equal distance from each other. The auxiliary blades also shall be placed between the gaps of two main blades keeping air passage with symmetrical gap distances. The arc angle of the auxiliary blades are smaller than the main blades. This type of construction allows the air to strike fully and freely against the concave side of the blades and gets reflected properly to strike again on the concave side of the adjacent blades, main as well as auxiliary ones.<br>
In this construction all the faces of the blades are utilized fully to accept air pressure to gain high rotational movement.<br><br><br>
The total blade and fins assembly are fixed and as per figure and symmetrically measured positions . They are kept fixed on a fibre glass moulded sheet which constitute the floor of the system.<br>
The advantages gained by the propelling system of the present invention are :<br>
1)	Optimized movement and utilization of propelling blades and centre spiral fins.<br>
2)	The force exerted at nominal velocity of air is converted to useful higher value by repeated reflection system on the blades and drag and lift action on the spirally fixed fins at the centre.<br>
3)	The height, diameters and number of blades and fins with configuration depends on the wind pressure and the quantum of power to be generated.<br>
4)	The unit can be installed individually at a given nominal height depending on the air velocity for individual consumption.<br>
5)	The dynamo/alternator remains at a fixed position for this vertical shaft system and can be installed at the ground level, if desired.<br>
6)	Maintenance of the system is easy.<br>
7)	The Units can be installed on roof tops of a three storied building or on a multistoried building to generate Power for the premises below.<br>
8)	Number of units can be integrated as multiple generating system.<br>
9)	The unit is cost effective and efficient.<br>
10)	Having enormous potentiality of application these units can be used to sail boats, ships and many other transporting and utility systems.<br>
11)	The drive system of the units can be constructed with total pulley system or with total gear system or in combination of both as shown in this case.<br>
12)	This system can also be utilized to drive pumps, boat, etc directly without attaching any power generating unit.<br>
13)	The system is non-polluting and not hazardous.<br>
14)	This type of propelling system does not require high mast.<br>
15)	Smaller individual supply units could be manufactured for individual families, small villages and communities even to be installed at the far places in the land.<br><br><br>

18.	A system as claimed in any preceding claim wherein the blades and fins are arranged in a manner such that sufficient air gap is maintained between the edges of the blades and fins to allow a channelized circular movement of air vortex to create a cyclonic force to move the fins.<br>
19.	A system as claimed in any preceding claim wherein the inner and outer surfaces of the blades and spiral fins are highly glazed polished such that the air slides easily on the back side to create a low pressure to accelerate the intensity of the striking air front and the polished inner surface allows easy reflection of air without losing much of its kinetic energy.<br>
20.	A system as claimed in any preceding claim wherein the force of air is repeatedly reflected within the blades and pressure is applied on the turbo fins at the centre accelerating the rotational movement of the system such that the force is increased by about six times the force acting on any system with radially arranged blades.<br>
21.	A system as claimed in any preceding claim wherein the top part of the system is partially closed so as to keep the moving air trapped for some time such that its force loses its strength considerably and then gets pushed out by fresh incoming air flow, developing a reactionary force while going out.<br>
22.	A power generating unit comprising the propelling system as claimed in any preceding claim operatively connected with dynamo or alternator by means of pulleys,<br><br><br>
gears, v belts and the like and adapted to generate power by converting the high rotational torque attained at low wind speed by the said propelling system.<br>
23.	A power generating unit as claimed in claim 22 wherein the number of blades and their sizes including that of turbo fins are selected considering the amount of power to be generated such that the circumference of the reference circle is divided equally in as many parts as there are blades.<br>
24.	A power generating unit as claimed in claims 22-23 wherein the base plate of the said propelling system is fixed on a metal pulley mounted on frictionless thrust and ball bearings such that the pulley gets its rotational movement from the rotating blades and from the spiral fins of the propelling system which is transmitted to the dynamo or the alternator for generating power.<br>
25.	A power generating unit as claimed in claims 22-24 wherein the V belt from the pulley is coupled to a smaller pulley fixed on a vertical shaft, said vertical shaft further provided with bevel gear.<br>
