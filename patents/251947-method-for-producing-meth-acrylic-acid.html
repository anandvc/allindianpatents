				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a method for producing<br>
(meth)acrylic acid, particularly to a method for producing<br>
acrylic acid in good yield without any special operation even<br>
in an unsteady state which arises at startup or due to some<br>
accident or the like.<br>
Description of the Related Art<br>
[0002]<br>
Acrylic acid and methacrylic acid (occasionally referred<br>
to as (meth) acrylic acid in this specification and claims) are<br>
useful raw materials widely used as raw materials for chemical<br>
products, and various production methods thereof are proposed.<br>
For example, as methods for producing acrylic acid industrially,<br>
a method in which propylene and/or acrolein are subjected to<br>
the catalytic gas phase oxidation is commonly used, and a method<br>
in which an acrylic acid-containing gas obtained by the<br>
catalytic gas phase oxidation method is condensed or absorbed<br>
in an absorption liquid to make an acrylic acid-containing<br>
solution followed by being subjected to distillation and<br>
crystallization to obtain a purified acrylic acid is proposed.<br>
[0003]<br>
As a purification process, in addition to the method<br>
described above, for example, in Japanese Patent Publication<br>
No. 2005-15478A, a method in which an acrylic acid-containing<br>
gas is brought in contact with an aqueous solution for<br>
absorption in an absorption column to obtain an . acrylic<br>
acid-containing solution, and the acrylic acid-containing<br>
solution as a crude acrylic acid is directly subjected to a<br>
crystallization process, and a distillate obtained by<br><br>
distilling a residual mother liquid discharged in the<br>
crystallization process is circulated in the absorption column<br>
is proposed. Such circulation to introduce a high-concentration<br>
acrylic acid-containing solution in the crystallization<br>
process has an effect of obtaining a highly purified acrylic<br>
acid with good absorption efficiency, and even more, the<br>
production process is easy and simple.<br>
[0004]<br>
In Japanese Patent Publication No. 2003-530376A, the<br>
purification of acrylic acid using a cleaning column having a<br>
function of forcible transport of crystal for the<br>
crystallization of acrylic acid is proposed.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0005]<br>
In accordance with the methods described in Japanese<br>
Patent Publication No. 2005-15478A and Japanese Patent<br>
Publication No. 2003-530376A, it is possible to obtain acrylic<br>
acid having high purity by easy and simple processes, but both<br>
of the above methods are only effective when the purification<br>
process of acrylic acid is already put in a steady state, and<br>
when it is in an unsteady state, for example, when the<br>
concentration of water in the acrylic acid-containing solution<br>
becomes higher at startup or due to some accident, the<br>
crystallization process is not smoothly carried out and it will<br>
be difficult to obtain a purified acrylic acid having high<br>
purity and the yield will be lower; in a worse case, it will<br>
be difficult to continue the operation itself.<br>
[0006]<br>
Therefore, when the concentration of water in the acrylic<br>
acid-containing solution is high, the acrylic acid-containing<br>
solution has to be disposed of without being subjected to<br>
crystallization process, or has to be subjected newly to the<br>
water separation operation to lower the concentration of water<br>
before being supplied to a device for the crystallization<br>
process. As a result, the yield of acrylic acid is lowered in<br><br>
the entire process, and the cost increases due to the additional<br>
water separation operation.<br>
[0007] <br>
The problem described above does not occur in a method<br>
in which the crystallization is performed after an acrylic<br>
acid-containing solution is distilled, and as described above,<br>
it is a new problem found in a production method in which an<br>
acrylic acid-containing solution obtained by condensing an<br>
acrylic acid-containing gas or bringing it in contact with an<br>
absorption liquid is directly subjected to a crystallization<br>
process. There is also a case in which the acrylic<br>
acid-containing liquid obtained from the acrylic<br>
acid-containing gas is subjected to a separation process step<br>
followed by a crystallization process to separate reaction<br>
by-products, but regardless of whether or not the separation<br>
process step is carried out, the crystallization process can't<br>
be carried out smoothly when the acrylic acid-containing<br>
solution to be subjected to the crystallization process has a<br>
high concentration of water.<br>
[0008]<br>
The present invention has been accomplished in view of<br>
the above circumstances. The object of the present invention<br>
is, even when the (meth) acrylic acid-containing solution which<br>
is a raw liquid material in a crystallization process has a high<br>
concentration of water, to enable the collection of the purified<br>
(meth) acrylic acid having high purity and to increase the yield<br>
of (meth)acrylic acid throughout the entire process, without<br>
increasing the cost too much.<br>
[0009]<br>
The present inventor intensively examined the above<br>
problems, and accomplished the present invention with<br>
discoveries that (1) when the acrylic acid-containing solution<br>
to be subjected to the crystallization process contains more<br>
than 10 mass % of water, purity and yield of the resultant<br>
purified acrylic acid are lowered; (2) by mixing an acrylic<br>
acid-containing solution having sufficiently low<br><br>
concentration of water or a purified acrylic acid in the acrylic<br>
acid-containing solution containing more than 10 mass % of<br>
water, the concentration of water thereof can be made 10 mass %<br>
or less, and if subjecting the resultant solution to the<br>
crystallization process, the purified acrylic acid having high<br>
purity can be obtained in good yield; or (3) if the acrylic<br>
acid-containing solution contains more than 10 mass % of water,<br>
it is to be used as an absorption liquid in an absorption process<br>
step, and to be circulated like this so that an acrylic<br>
acid-containing solution containing 10 mass % or less of water<br>
can be obtained, and if subjecting the resultant solution to<br>
the crystallization process, the purified acrylic acid having<br>
high purity can be obtained in good yield; in addition, with<br>
respect to methacrylic acid, the purified methacrylic acid<br>
having high purity can also be obtained in good yield in a same<br>
manner as acrylic acid.<br>
[0010]<br>
Namely, the method for producing (meth)acrylic acid<br>
according to the present invention comprises obtaining a<br>
(meth)acrylic acid-containing gas from a raw material of<br>
(meth)acrylic acid by a catalytic gas phase oxidation reaction<br>
and obtaining a (meth) acrylic acid-containing solution from the<br>
(meth)acrylic acid-containing gas followed by subjecting the<br>
(meth)acrylic acid-containing solution to a crystallization<br>
process or subjecting the (meth)acrylic acid-containing<br>
solution obtained after separating the reaction by-products<br>
therefrom to a crystallization process, thereby producing the<br>
purified (meth) acrylic acid; in the method, it is characterized<br>
that the (meth)acrylic acid-containing solution or the<br>
(meth)acrylic acid-containing solution upstream thereof (for<br>
example, a (meth)acrylic acid-containing solution prior to a<br>
separation process in a production method including a step of<br>
separation process of reaction by-products) is mixed with a<br>
purified (meth)acrylic acid and/or a (meth)acrylic<br>
acid-containing solution containing 10 mass % or less of water<br>
to make the concentration of water 10 mass % or less followed<br><br>
by carrying out a crystallization process when the<br>
concentration of water in the (meth)acrylic acid-containing<br>
solution to be subjected to the crystallization process is<br>
higher than 10 mass %. A method for obtaining a (meth) acrylic<br>
acid-containing solution from a (meth) acrylic acid-containing<br>
gas includes a method condensing the (meth)acrylic<br>
acid-containing gas and a method obtaining the (meth)acrylic<br>
acid-containing solution by bringing the (meth)acrylic<br>
acid-containing gas in contact with an absorption liquid. The<br>
absorption liquid includes water and high boiling point<br>
solvents.<br>
[0011]<br>
As the purified (meth)acrylic acid to be mixed in the<br>
(meth)acrylic acid-containing solution having a concentration<br>
of water higher than 10 mass %, a purified (meth) acrylic acid<br>
which has been obtained separately may be used (for example,<br>
a purified (meth)acrylic acid produced during an operation in<br>
a steady state in the production line may be stored for use later,<br>
or a purified (meth) acrylic acid obtained in another production<br>
line (in addition -to the one obtained by a crystallization<br>
process, it may be the one obtained by a distillation process)<br>
may be used), or a purified (meth)acrylic acid obtained in the<br>
crystallization process may be circulated for use while the<br>
production process is in operation.<br>
[0012]<br>
When the purified (meth) acrylic acid to be mixed is the<br>
one obtained by the same production method (namely, the purified<br>
(meth)acrylic acid obtained by subjecting a (meth)acrylic<br>
acid-containing solution produced from a (meth)acrylic<br>
acid-containing gas obtained by the catalytic gas phase<br>
oxidation reaction to a crystallization process or subjecting<br>
the (meth)acrylic acid-containing solution obtained after<br>
separating the reaction by-products therefrom to a<br>
crystallization process) , it is preferable because impurities<br>
included in a slight amount therein do not affect the production<br>
method.<br><br>
Additionally, there are advantages when the follows are<br>
used as the purified (meth) acrylic acid. Namely, [1] : initially<br>
purified (meth)acrylic acid obtained at the onset of the<br>
operation is discharged while cleaning each part such as a pipe<br>
and a tank, so that it contains various dirt. Therefore,<br>
although the initially purified (meth)acrylic acid has to be<br>
disposed of under ordinary circumstances, it can be repurified<br>
by bringing it back to the previous step for use just as the<br>
present invention, and accordingly, the ratio of loss in the<br>
whole process can be reduced. [2] : when the production line is<br>
brought to an emergency stop and the like for some reason, the<br>
purified (meth)acrylic acid is not transported to a<br>
predetermined tank (namely, it is not subjected to a<br>
polymerization-prevention treatment), but stored in the<br>
production line. When the accumulation time (stopping time)<br>
becomes long, a polymer and the like may be formed to lower the<br>
purity of the purified (meth) acrylic acid. However, by bringing<br>
it back to the previous step for use without disposing of it<br>
just as the present invention, the ratio of loss in the whole<br>
process can be reduced.<br>
[0014]<br>
Additional, as the (meth)acrylic acid-containing<br>
solution containing 10 mass % or less of water to be mixed in<br>
the (meth)acrylic acid-containing solution containing more<br>
than 10 mass % of water, the (meth)acrylic acid-containing<br>
solution containing 10 mass % or less of water obtained in a<br>
process producing (meth)acrylic acid may be stored for use.<br>
[0015]<br>
In addition, the method for producing (meth) acrylic acid<br>
according to the present invention comprises obtaining a<br>
(meth)acrylic acid-containing gas from a raw material of<br>
(meth)acrylic acid by the catalytic gas phase oxidation<br>
reaction and obtaining a (meth)acrylic acid-containing<br>
solution from the (meth)acrylic acid-containing gas followed<br>
by subjecting the (meth)acrylic acid-containing solution to a<br><br>
crystallization process or subjecting the (meth)acrylic<br>
acid-containing solution obtained after separating the<br>
reaction by-products therefrom to a crystallization process,<br>
thereby producing the purified (meth)acrylic acid; in the<br>
method, it is characterized that the (meth)acrylic<br>
acid-containing solution or the (meth) acrylic acid-containing<br>
solution upstream thereof is used as an absorption liquid when<br>
the (meth)acrylic acid-containing solution to be subjected to<br>
the crystallization process contains more than 10 mass % of<br>
water.<br>
[0016]<br>
In this case, as an absorption liquid used for absorption,<br>
the (meth)acrylic acid-containing solution containing more<br>
than 10 mass % of water may be used; alternatively, the<br>
(meth) acrylic acid-containing solution containing more than 10<br>
mass % of water may be concomitantly used with a usual absorption<br>
liquid. In addition to a use for absorption by being circulated<br>
during an operation of the production process, the<br>
(meth)acrylic acid-containing solution containing more than<br>
10 mass % of water can be used as an absorption liquid after<br>
temporarily being stored. Further, in a case wherein it is used<br>
as an absorption liquid after being temporarily stored as<br>
described above, it may be used as an absorption liquid after<br>
the (meth) acrylic acid-containing solution containing 10 mass %<br>
or less of water can be obtained in a stable manner, (in this<br>
case, it is preferred to use a necessary amount of the liquid<br>
little by little to an extent that the (meth)acrylic<br>
acid-containing solution obtained in the production process can<br>
maintain the concentration of water of 10 mass % or less) , or<br>
it may be used as an absorption liquid in a state where only<br>
a (meth)acrylic acid-containing solution containing more than<br>
10 mass % of water can be obtained.<br>
[0017]<br>
As the method for supplying the (meth)acrylic<br>
acid-containing solution containing more than 10 mass % of<br>
water to the absorption column, a supply line of a (meth) acrylic<br><br>
acid-containing solution containing more than 10 mass % of<br>
water may be connected to a supply line of a usual absorption<br>
liquid so as to supply the solution to the absorption column;<br>
alternatively, a supply line of the (meth)acrylic<br>
acid-containing solution containing more than 10 mass % of<br>
water alone may be disposed in the absorption column (in a manner<br>
that the supply line has an opening at a position higher than<br>
a gas feed inlet of the absorption column) so as to supply the<br>
solution directly to the absorption column.<br>
[0018]<br>
In addition, the method for producing (meth) acrylic acid<br>
according to the present invention comprises obtaining a<br>
(meth)acrylic acid-containing gas from a raw material of<br>
(meth)acrylic acid by the catalytic gas phase oxidation<br>
reaction, and obtaining a (meth)acrylic acid-containing<br>
solution from the (meth)acrylic acid-containing gas, followed<br>
by subjecting the (meth)acrylic acid-containing solution to a<br>
crystallization process or subjecting the (meth)acrylic<br>
acid-containing solution obtained after separating the<br>
reaction by-products therefrom to a crystallization process,<br>
thereby producing the purified (meth)acrylic acid; in the<br>
method, it is characterized that when the (meth)acrylic<br>
acid-containing solution contains more than 10 mass % of water,<br>
it is temporarily stored, and when the (meth)acrylic<br>
acid-containing solution containing 10 mass % or less of water<br>
can be obtained in a stable manner, the stored (meth)acrylic<br>
acid-containing solution containing more than 10 mass % of<br>
water is mixed therein to an extent that the concentration of<br>
water is maintained at 10 mass % or less, followed by being<br>
subjected to the crystallization process.<br>
[0019]<br>
Namely, in a case where the (meth) acrylic acid-containing<br>
solution contains more than 10 mass % of water, it is temporarily<br>
stored, and when the purification process comes to a steady<br>
state, the (meth)acrylic acid-containing solution containing<br>
more than 10 mass % of water which has been stored is mixed in<br><br>
a (meth)acrylic acid-containing solution containing 10 mass %<br>
or less of water. However, mixing is made to an extent that the<br>
concentration of water is retained 10 mass % or less, and the<br>
resultant (meth)acrylic acid-containing solution containing<br>
10 mass % or less of water is to be supplied to the step of the<br>
crystallization process.<br>
[0020]<br>
With respect to the production methods, methods for<br>
obtaining a (meth)acrylic acid-containing solution from a<br>
(meth)acrylic acid-containing gas include a method condensing<br>
a(meth)acrylic acid-containing gas and a method obtaining a<br>
(meth)acrylic acid-containing solution by bringing the<br>
(meth)acrylic acid-containing gas in contact with an<br>
absorption liquid and the like.<br>
[0021]<br>
Further, in the present invention, each of the above<br>
methods may be used in combination.<br>
[0022]<br>
In the method for producing (meth) acrylic acid, when the<br>
method obtaining a (meth)acrylic acid-containing solution by<br>
bringing a (meth) acrylic acid-containing gas in contact with an<br>
absorption liquid is employed in which water is used as the<br>
absorption liquid, the concentration of water tends to be high<br>
so that it is particularly useful to apply the present invention<br>
thereto.<br>
[0023]<br>
The reaction by-products include acrolein, methacrolein<br>
(hereinafter occasionally referred to as (meth) acrolein) and<br>
the like. Additionally, a case in which the (meth)acrylic<br>
acid-containing solution to be subjected to the crystallization<br>
process contains 10 mass % or less of water (when it contains<br>
10 mass % or less of water even without carrying out a measure<br>
according to the present invention) is called a steady state,<br>
while a case wherein the (meth) acrylic acid-containing solution<br>
to be subjected to the crystallization process contains more<br>
than 10 mass % of water(when it contains more than 10 mass %<br><br>
of water without carrying out a measure according to the present<br>
invention) is called an unsteady state.<br>
Brief Description of the Drawings<br>
[0024]<br>
FIG.l is a block diagram showing an example of a method<br>
for producing acrylic acid according to the present invention.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
[0025]<br>
FIG.l is a block diagram showing an example of the method<br>
for producing acrylic acid. First, a method for producing<br>
acrylic acid (purification process) in a steady state will be<br>
explained with reference to FIG.l.<br>
[0026]<br>
In a reactor 11, an acrylic acid-containing gas 12 is<br>
generated from a raw material of acrylic acid 13 by the<br>
catalytic gas phase oxidation reaction, and the acrylic<br>
acid-containing gas 12 is introduced to an absorption column<br>
14	(line 32) . In the absorption column 14, an absorption liquid<br>
15	and the acrylic acid-containing gas 12 are brought in contact<br>
to obtain an acrylic acid-containing solution 16 (absorption<br>
step). The methods of the contact include cross-flow contact,<br>
counter-flow contact and the like. In the present embodiment,<br>
 an absorption method wherein the absorption liquid is supplied<br>
from outside the system as a method for obtaining the acrylic<br>
acid-containing solution 16 will be described; however, for<br>
example, in a condensing method, the absorption liquid is not<br>
to be added from outside the system.<br>
[0027]<br>
Next, the acrylic acid-containing solution 16 is<br>
introduced to an acrolein separation column 17 (line 36), and<br>
acrolein is subjected to a separation process (acrolein<br>
separation process step). Methods for the separation process<br>
include distillation, diffusion or the like, and may be suitably<br>
selected depending on the concentrations of acrylic acid and<br><br>
acrolein contained. The step of the acrolein separation process<br>
can be skipped when the acrylic acid-containing solution 16 does<br>
not contain acrolein. Furthermore, if the acrylic<br>
acid-containing solution 16 is subjected to a crystallization<br>
process (crystallizer 19) via a step of the acrolein separation<br>
process, lowering of the concentration of water can be expected<br>
in the step of the acrolein separation process. In this view,<br>
in a method wherein the acrylic acid-containing solution 16<br>
obtained by condensing the acrylic acid-containing gas 12 or<br>
bringing it in contact with an absorption liquid is directly<br>
(i.e., without going through a step of the acrolein separation<br>
process) subjected to a crystallization process, it is<br>
preferred to obtain an acrylic acid-containing liquid having<br>
a high concentration of acrylic acid in an absorption step<br>
compared with that going through a step of the acrolein<br>
separation process.<br>
[0028]<br>
An acrylic acid-containing solution 18 obtained by the<br>
separation process or the acrylic acid-containing solution 16<br>
is supplied to the crystallizer 19 (line 38) to obtain the<br>
purified acrylic acid 20. The crystallization method at this<br>
time is not limited, and either a continuous type or a batch-type<br>
crystallizer may be used, and the crystallizer is not limited<br>
to one-stage, but may be two or more stages for use in<br>
implementing the method. For example, as a continuous type<br>
crystallizer, a column-shaped one having a crystallization part,<br>
a solid-liquid separation part and a crystal purification part<br>
all united in one can be used. In the figure, reference numeral<br>
21 denotes a residual mother liquid discharged from the<br>
crystallizer 19. In Japanese Patent Publication No. 2005-15478A,<br>
at least a part of the residual mother liquid 21 is distilled,<br>
and the resultant distillate is to be supplied to the absorption<br>
column 14.<br>
[0029]<br>
Next, a method for producing acrylic acid (purification<br>
process) in an unsteady state will be explained.<br><br>
When the acrylic acid-containing solution 18 (the acrylic<br>
acid-containing solution 16 when the acrolein separation<br>
process is not carried out) contains more than 10 mass % of water,<br>
any one of following [a] to [d] or a combination of two or more<br>
thereof and the like (hereinafter occasionally referred to as<br>
measures [a] to [d] ) are employed so that the concentration<br>
of water in the acrylic acid-containing solution to be supplied<br>
to the crystallizer 19 is made 10 mass % or less.<br>
[0031]<br>
[a] : The purified acrylic acid 20 discharged from the<br>
crystallizer 19, or the purified acrylic acid 22 obtained in <br>
another production process is mixed in the acrylic<br>
acid-containing solution 18 (the acrylic acid-containing<br>
solution 16 when the acrolein separation process is not carried<br>
out) of the line 38, and the mixture is supplied to the<br>
crystallizer 19. Alternatively, the purified acrylic acid 20<br>
or 22 is mixed in the acrylic acid-containing solution 16 of<br>
the line 36 followed by subjecting the mixture to the acrolein<br>
separation process, and the resultant acrylic acid-containing<br>
solution 18 is supplied to the crystallizer 19.<br>
[0032]<br>
[b]: An acrylic acid-containing solution having a low<br>
concentration of water obtained from the absorption column 14<br>
in a steady state (hereinafter referred to as extracted liquid)<br>
is stored in a tank 25 used for the extracted liquid (line 34)<br>
in advance, and when the acrylic acid-containing solution 16<br>
containing more than 10 mass % of water is discharged from the<br>
absorption column 14, the extracted liquid 23 is mixed in the<br>
acrylic acid-containing solution 16 (line 33). If necessary,<br>
the mixture is subjected to the acrolein separation process<br>
followed by being supplied to the crystallizer 19.<br>
[0033]<br>
[c] : The acrylic acid-containing solution 18 or 16 having a high<br>
concentration of water is supplied from an absorption liquid<br>
feed inlet of the absorption column 14 (namely, the acrylic<br><br>
acid-containing solution 18 or 16 having a high concentration<br>
of water is supplied to the absorption column 14 from an<br>
intermediate tank discharge line 26 via an absorption liquid<br>
supply line 27) or from a feed inlet for the return of the acrylic<br>
acid-containing solution (the feed inlet for the return of the<br>
acrylic acid-containing solution is disposed at a position<br>
higher than the gas feed inlet) connected with the absorption<br>
column 14 (namely, the acrylic acid-containing solution 18 or<br>
16 having a high concentration of water is supplied to the<br>
absorption column 14 from the intermediate tank discharge line<br>
28) . In this manner, the acrylic acid-containing solutions 18<br>
and 16 having a high concentration of water are circulated as<br>
absorption liquids, thereby the acrylic acid component is<br>
condensed so that the acrylic acid-containing solution 16<br>
having a low concentration of water can be obtained. If the<br>
amount of the acrylic acid-containing solution 18 or 16 having<br>
a high concentration of water is more than that needed in an<br>
absorption liquid in the absorption column 14, it is preferable<br>
that the acrylic acid-containing solution 18 or 16 is stored<br>
temporarily in an intermediate tank 24, and an amount needed<br>
for absorption in the absorption column 14 is supplied little<br>
by little. When the amount of the acrylic acid-containing<br>
solution 18 or 16 having a high concentration of water is<br>
sufficiently smaller than that needed in the absorption liquid<br>
in the absorption column 14, the acrylic acid-containing<br>
solution 18 or 16 may be supplied to the absorption liquid feed<br>
inlet without going through the intermediate tank 24. Further,<br>
as a timing for supplying an acrylic acid-containing solution<br>
having a high concentration of water in the intermediate tank<br>
24 to the absorption column 14, it may be when the concentration<br>
of water in the acrylic acid-containing solution 16 discharged<br>
from the absorption column 14 becomes 10 mass % or less, or before<br>
the concentration of water becomes 10 mass % or less (when it<br>
is higher than 10 mass %).<br>
[0034]<br>
[d] : When the acrylic acid-containing solution 18 or 16 having<br><br>
a high concentration of water is temporarily stored in the<br>
intermediate tank 24 (line 37) and the purification process of<br>
acrylic acid comes to a steady state, the solution is brought<br>
back from the intermediate tank 24 through the line 35 to the<br>
original line (line 38), thereafter is mixed with the acrylic<br>
acid-containing solution 18 or 16 in a steady state, and the<br>
resultant mixture is supplied to the crystallizer 19. However,<br>
in order that the concentration of water in the acrylic<br>
acid-containing solution after being mixed does not become<br>
higher than 10 mass %, the amount of the acrylic acid-containing<br>
solution supplied from the intermediate tank 24 is to be<br>
adjusted.<br>
[0035]<br>
In accordance with [a] to [d] described above, by making<br>
the acrylic acid-containing solution to be supplied to the<br>
crystallizer 19 contain 10 mass % or less of water, a step for<br>
crystallization can be carried out smoothly without any special<br>
operation, and the purified acrylic acid with high purity can<br>
be produced in good yield.<br>
[0036]<br>
As a timing for switching from an operation mode<br>
implementing the measures [a] to [d] (a method using any one<br>
of [a] to [d], or a combination of two or more thereof) (an<br>
operation mode in which measures for an unsteady state are<br>
implemented) to an operation mode for a steady state (steady<br>
operation), the operation can be switched to the steady<br>
operation not only immediately after the concentration of water<br>
in the acrylic acid-containing solution 18 (the acrylic<br>
acid-containing solution 16 in a case where an acrolein<br>
separation process is not carried out) becomes 10 mass % or less,<br>
but also at a stage where the concentration of water in the<br>
acrylic acid-containing solution 18 (or the acrylic<br>
acid-containing solution 16) becomes 8 mass % or less, and<br>
further, 5 mass % or less.<br>
[0037]<br>
Even though the acrylic acid-containing solution 18 (16)<br><br>
contains 10 mass % or less of water, it cannot be said that the<br>
process is in a sufficiently stable condition as soon as the<br>
concentration of water becomes 10 mass % or less, so that there<br>
will possibly be a need to switch to the operation mode<br>
implementing the measures [a] to [d] again in a short time.<br>
Accordingly, in view of complication in switching, it is<br>
preferred to switch to the steady operation after the<br>
concentration of water becomes 8 mass % or less, or, further,<br>
5 mass % or less, which is a more stable condition. Additionally,<br>
by implementing the measures [a] to [d], it becomes possible<br>
to introduce an acrylic acid-containing solution having a lower<br>
concentration of water to the crystallizer, so the<br>
crystallization process of the solution having a lower<br>
concentration of water can be carried out more smoothly, and<br>
product specifications will also become higher. Therefore, from<br>
a viewpoint of the concentration of water, it is preferable to<br>
switch to the steady operation after the concentration of water<br>
in the acrylic acid-containing solution 18 (16) becomes 8 mass %<br>
or less, or, further, 5 mass % or less.<br>
[0038]<br>
On the other hand, in order to lower the concentration<br>
of water, it takes longer to implement the above measures [a]<br>
to [d] (compared with a case wherein the concentration of water<br>
becomes 10 to 8 mass %, it takes longer for the concentration<br>
of water to become 8 to 5 mass %, and it takes further longer<br>
for the concentration of water to become 5 mass % or less);<br>
therefore, an operation mode implementing the measures [a] to<br>
[d] (unsteady operation) needs to be continued for a long period<br>
of time. Therefore, from this viewpoint, it is preferred to<br>
switch to the steady operation at a stage in which the<br>
concentration of water in the acrylic acid-containing solution<br>
18 (16) is not lowered so much (for example, a concentration<br>
of water of 8 to 5 mass %, preferably 10 to 8 mass %).<br>
[0039]<br>
Here, an absorption method for obtaining an acrylic<br>
acid-containing solution from an acrylic acid-containing gas<br><br>
using the absorption liquid described above will be described.<br>
[0040]<br>
As an aqueous solution for absorption, a wide range of<br>
aqueous solutions may be used as long as they can absorb acrylic<br>
acid, and a condensate obtained by cooling and condensing a gas<br>
discharged from the top of the absorption column (which is<br>
discharged in order to minimize the loss of acrylic acid<br>
discharged outside the system) is preferably used as an aqueous<br>
solution for absorption. The condensate often contains acrylic<br>
acid, so if it is used as the absorption aqueous solution, the<br>
acrylic acid-containing solution having a high concentration<br>
of acrylic acid can be obtained. It is also a preferred<br>
embodiment that the' gas discharged from the top of the<br>
absorption column is partially or fully recycled in the reactor.<br>
[0041]<br>
The aqueous solution for absorption is preferably<br>
introduced to the absorption column at a temperature of 0 to<br>
50°C, more preferably 10 to 40°C.<br>
[0042]<br>
A ratio of mass flow rate of an aqueous solution for<br>
absorption to be newly supplied from outside to an acrylic<br>
acid-containing gas may be suitably selected in accordance with<br>
an objective acrylic acid concentration, and preferably 0.1 to<br>
1.5 times the mass flow rate of acrylic acid included in the<br>
acrylic acid-containing gas, more preferably 0.1 to 1.0 times,<br>
even more preferably 0.15 to 0.8 times. Then an aqueous solution<br>
for absorption having this mass flow rate is subjected to<br>
counter-flow contact with an acrylic acid-containing gas to<br>
absorb acrylic acid. If the ratio of mass flow rate is lower<br>
than 0.1 times, efficiency of the acrylic acid absorption column<br>
may be extremely lowered.<br>
[0043]<br>
In addition, since acrylic acid is a polymerizable<br>
material,- for a purpose to prevent the polymerization, one or<br>
more compounds selected from the group consisting of a N-oxyl<br>
compound, a phenol compound, a manganese salt such as manganese<br><br>
acetate and the like, a dialkyldithiocarbamate copper salt such<br>
as dibutylcarbamate copper and the like, a nitro compound, an<br>
amine compound and phenothiazine may be included in the aqueous<br>
solution for absorption (refer to Japanese Patent Publication<br>
No. 2001-348360A, Japanese Patent Publication No. 2001-348358A,<br>
Japanese Patent Publication No.2001-348359A and the like).<br>
[0044]<br>
The acrylic acid absorption column is generally operated<br>
under a normal pressure or above. During the steady operation,<br>
the column-top pressure (gauge pressure) is preferably at 0 to<br>
0.4 MPa, more preferably at 0 to 0.1 MPa, even more preferably<br>
at 0 to 0.03 MPa. If it is lower than 0 MPa (gauge pressure),<br>
a decompressor becomes necessary and it costs equipment and<br>
utilities expenses, while if it is higher than 0.4 MPa (gauge<br>
pressure),the temperature of the absorption column needs to be<br>
increased considerably in order to discharge low boiling point<br>
substances, so that the absorption efficiency may be lowered.<br>
[0045]<br>
A column top temperature of an absorption column is<br>
generally from 30 to 85°C, preferably from 40 to 80°C.<br>
[0046]<br>
Under the absorption condition described above, in the<br>
present embodiment, an acrylic acid-containing solution with<br>
a following blending ratio can be obtained: acrylic acid :80<br>
to 98 mass %, water:1 to 19 mass %,other impurities (acids such<br>
as acetic acid, maleic acid, propionic acid and the like,<br>
aldehydes such as furfural, formaldehyde and the like) : 1 to 10<br>
mass %.<br>
[0047]<br>
With respect to the method for producing methacrylic acid<br>
(purification process), the crystallization step can also be<br>
carried out smoothly without any special operation in a same<br>
manner as the acrylic acid, thereby a purified methacrylic acid<br>
with high purity can be produced in good yield.<br>
[0048]<br>
The concentration of water in the acrylic acid-containing<br><br>
solution (or the methacrylic acid-containing solution) can be<br>
determined by Karl Fischer's method. The acrylic acid<br>
concentration in the acrylic acid-containing solution (the<br>
methacrylic acid concentration in the methacrylic<br>
acid-containing solution) can be determined by any one of gas<br>
chromatography analysis, electrical conductivity measurement<br>
and neutralization titration.<br>
[0049]<br>
Hereinafter, the present invention will be described in<br>
more detail with reference to examples, but the present<br>
invention is not restricted by the following examples and can<br>
be suitably modified within the scope described above or below<br>
and such modifications are also included in the technical scope<br>
of the present invention.<br>
[0050]<br><example><br>
The acrylic acid-containing gas 12 obtained by the<br>
catalytic gas phase oxidation method was introduced to the<br>
absorption column 14 to be brought in counter-flow contact with<br>
the absorption liquid 15, thereby the acrylic acid-containing<br>
solution 16 was obtained. The liquid composition of the acrylic<br>
acid-containing solution 16 comprised 65.0 mass % of acrylic<br>
acid, 20.0 mass % of water, and 15.0 mass % of other impurities.<br>
[0051]<br>
The purified acrylic acid 20 (the composition of the<br>
purified acrylic acid comprised 99.4 mass % of acrylic acid,<br>
0 . 004 mass % of water and 0 . 6 mass % of other impurities) obtained<br>
in advance during an operation in a steady state was mixed in<br>
the acrylic acid-containing solution 16 to give a mixture<br>
thereof. The mixing mass ratio of the acrylic acid-containing<br>
solution to the purified acrylic acid was 2:5. The above mixture<br>
contained 5.7 mass % of water, 89.6 mass % of acrylic acid, and<br>
4.7 mass % of other impurities.<br>
[0052]<br>
The above mixture was supplied to the crystallizer 19 to<br>
be subjected to crystallization. The resultant acrylic acid had<br><br>
a purity of 99.4 mass %. The purification yield of acrylic acid<br>
was 99.9 %.<br>
[0053]<br>
In this Example 1, although no special operation other<br>
than mixing the purified acrylic acid was carried out, purified<br>
acrylic acid having high purity could be produced in good yield<br>
as described above.<br>
[0054]<br><example><br>
The acrylic acid-containing gas 12 obtained by the<br>
catalytic gas phase oxidation method was brought in<br>
counter-flow contact with the absorption liquid 15 in the<br>
absorption column 14 to obtain the acrylic acid-containing<br>
solution 16. The liquid composition of the acrylic<br>
acid-containing solution 16 comprised 75.0 mass % of acrylic<br>
acid, 20.0 mass % of water, and 5.0 mass % of other impurities.<br>
[0055]<br>
On the other hand, during an operation in a steady state,<br>
an acrylic acid-containing solution containing 10 mass % or less<br>
of water discharged from the absorption column 14 was extracted<br>
and stored in advance (the acrylic acid-containing solution is<br>
referred to as extracted liquid) (tank 25 for the extracted<br>
liquid) , and the extracted liquid 23 was mixed with the acrylic<br>
acid-containing solution 16 of the line 36 (a mixture). The<br>
mixing mass ratio of the acrylic acid-containing solution to<br>
the extracted liquid was 1:20. The composition of the extracted<br>
liquid 23 comprised 88.7 mass % of acrylic acid, 4.4 mass % of<br>
water, and 6.9 mass % of other impurities. The liquid<br>
composition of the above mixture comprised 88.0 mass % of<br>
acrylic acid, 5.1 mass % of water, and 6.8 mass % of other<br>
impurities.<br>
[0056]<br>
The mixture was supplied to the crystallizer 19 to be<br>
subjected to crystallization. The resultant acrylic acid had<br>
a purity of 99.4 mass %. The purification yield of acrylic acid<br>
was 99.9 %.<br><br>
In this Example 2, too, although no special operation<br>
other than mixing the acrylic acid-containing solution having<br>
a low concentration of water was carried out, the purified<br>
acrylic acid having high purity could be produced in good yield<br>
as described above.<br>
[0058]<br><example><br>
The acrylic acid-containing gas 12 obtained by the<br>
-catalytic gas phase oxidation method was subjected to<br>
counter-flow contact with the absorption liquid 15 in the<br>
absorption column 14 to obtain the acrylic acid-containing<br>
solution 16. The liquid composition of the acrylic<br>
acid-containing solution 16 comprised 75.0 mass % of acrylic<br>
acid, 15.0 mass % of water and 10.0 mass % of other impurities.<br>
[0059]<br>
The acrylic acid-containing solution 16 was stored in the<br>
intermediate tank 24 (the stored acrylic acid-containing<br>
solution is occasionally referred to as a stored acrylic<br>
acid-containing solution), and from the tank, the acrylic<br>
acid-containing solution was supplied from an absorption liquid<br>
feed inlet of the absorption column 14 in a manner that it was<br>
included in an amount of 20 mass % relative to the amount of<br>
the absorption liquid (line 27 via line 26) . Then, this<br>
operation was continued until the concentration of water in the<br>
acrylic acid-containing solution 16 (line 36) discharged from<br>
the absorption column 14 became 10 mass % or less.<br>
[0060]<br>
After that, it was confirmed that the acrylic<br>
acid-containing solution 16 discharged from the absorption<br>
column 14 had a sufficiently low concentration of water which<br>
can be obtained in a stable manner (specifically, the liquid<br>
composition comprised 86.0 mass % of acrylic acid, 8.0 mass %<br>
of water, and 6.0 mass % of other impurities) , and the acrylic<br>
acid-containing solution 16 having a low concentration of water<br>
was supplied to the crystallizer 19 for crystallization.<br><br>
The resultant acrylic acid showed a purity of 99.4 mass %,<br>
and the purification yield of acrylic acid was 99.9 %.<br>
[0062]<br>
In this Example 3, although no special operation was<br>
carried out except that the acrylic acid-containing solution<br>
containing more than 10.0 mass % of water was brought back to<br>
the absorption column as the absorption liquid, the purified<br>
acrylic acid having high purity could be produced in good yield<br>
as described above.<br>
[0063]<br><example><br>
The acrylic acid-containing gas 12 obtained by the<br>
catalytic gas phase oxidation method was subjected to<br>
counter-low contact with the absorption liquid 15 in the<br>
absorption column 14 to obtain the acrylic acid-containing<br>
solution 16. Next, the acrylic acid-containing solution 16 was<br>
supplied to the acrolein separation column 17 for subjecting<br>
acrolein and the like to separation by distillation, thereby<br>
the acrylic acid-containing solution 18 with acrolein and the<br>
like removed was obtained. The liquid composition of the acrylic<br>
acid-containing solution 18 comprised 67.0 mass % of acrylic<br>
acid, 20.0 mass % of water and 13.0 mass % of other impurities.<br>
[0064]<br>
The purified acrylic acid 20 (the composition of the<br>
purified acrylic acid comprised 99.4 mass % of acrylic acid,<br>
0.004 mass % of water, and 0.6 mass % of other impurities)<br>
obtained in advance during an operation in a steady state was<br>
mixed in the acrylic acid-containing solution 18 (line 38) to<br>
be supplied to the crystallizer 19. The mixing mass ratio of<br>
the acrylic acid-containing solution to the purified acrylic<br>
acid was 2: 5. The mixture contained 5.7 mass % of water, 90.1<br>
mass % of acrylic acid, and 4.1 mass % of other impurities.<br>
[0065]<br>
The acrylic acid obtained by crystallizing the mixture<br>
had a purity of 99.4 mass %. The purification yield of acrylic<br><br>
acid was 99.9 %.<br>
[0066]<br>
In the Example 4, too, although no special operation other<br>
than mixing the purified acrylic acid was carried out, the<br>
purified acrylic acid having high purity could be produced in .<br>
good yield as described above.<br>
[0067]<br><example> (Comparative Example)<br>
The acrylic acid-containing gas 12 obtained by the<br>
catalytic gas phase oxidation method was subjected to<br>
counter-flow contact with the absorption liquid 15 in the<br>
absorption column 14 to obtain the acrylic acid-containing<br>
solution 16. The liquid composition of the acrylic<br>
acid-containing solution 16 comprised 65.0 mass % of acrylic<br>
acid, 20 . 0 mass % of water, and 15 . 0 mass % of other impurities .<br>
[0068]<br>
The acrylic acid-containing solution 16 was supplied to<br>
the crystallizer 19. In the crystallization process, the above<br>
Examples 1 to 4 showed an acrylic acid crystallization speed<br>
equivalent to that at a time of a steady operation, compared<br>
with this, the crystallization speed of acrylic acid in Example<br>
5 is slow so that the crystal amount obtained in an equivalent<br>
time to , that in Examples 1 to 4 was very small. The<br>
crystallization speed became slow probably because the melting<br>
point of the acrylic acid-containing solution was lowered due<br>
to the high concentration of water in the acrylic<br>
acid-containing solution 16 so that the heat exchange<br>
efficiency with the refrigerant became poor. Further, a change<br>
in the solution component accompanied with the progress of<br>
crystallization led to further lowering of the melting point<br>
so that it became difficult to continue the crystallization step<br>
and thus the operation was stopped.<br>
[0069]<br><example> (Comparative Example)<br>
The acrylic acid-containing gas 12 obtained by the<br>
catalytic gas phase oxidation method was subjected to<br><br>
counter-flow contact with the absorption liquid 15 in the<br>
absorption column 14, thereby the acrylic acid-containing<br>
solution 16 was obtained. The liquid composition of the acrylic<br>
acid-containing solution 16 comprised 65.0 mass % of acrylic<br>
acid, 20.0 mass % of water, and 15.0 mass % of other impurities.<br>
[0070]<br>
On the other hand, the purified acrylic acid 20 (the<br>
composition of the purified acrylic acid comprised 99.4 mass %<br>
of acrylic acid, 0.004 mass % of water and 0.6 mass % of other<br>
impurities) obtained in advance during an operation in a steady<br>
state was mixed in the acrylic acid-containing solution 16 in<br>
a manner that the mass ratio of the acrylic acid-containing<br>
solution to the purified acrylic acid became 2: 1, and the<br>
resultant mixture was supplied to the crystallizer 19. The<br>
mixture contained 13.3 mass % of water, 7 6.5 mass % of acrylic<br>
acid, and 10.2 mass % of other impurities.<br>
[0071]<br>
In the above crystallizer 19, only 60 mass % of the acrylic<br>
acid included in the mixture could be crystallized. It is<br>
probably because the melting point of the acrylic<br>
acid-containing solution was lowered since the concentration<br>
of water in the acrylic acid-containing solution supplied to<br>
the crystallizer 19 was high, resulting in the lower<br>
crystallization rate. Therefore, it became difficult to<br>
continue the crystallization process, and thus the operation<br>
was stopped.<br>
[0072]<br><example><br>
The acrylic acid-containing gas 12 obtained by the<br>
catalytic gas phase oxidation method was subjected to<br>
counter-flow contact with the absorption liquid 15 in the<br>
absorption column 14 to obtain the acrylic acid-containing<br>
solution 16. The liquid composition of the acrylic<br>
acid-containing solution 16 comprised 65.0 mass % of acrylic<br>
acid, 20.0 mass % of water, and 15.0 mass % of impurities.<br><br>
The purified acrylic acid 20 (the composition of the<br>
purified acrylic acid comprised 99.4 mass % of acrylic acid,<br>
0.004 mass % of water, and 0.6 mass % of other impurities)<br>
obtained in advance during an operation in a steady state was<br>
mixed in the acrylic acid-containing solution 16 in a manner<br>
that the ratio of the acrylic acid-containing solution to the<br>
purified acrylic acid became 1:1, thereafter supplied to the<br>
crystallizer 19. The mixture contained 10.0 mass % of water,<br>
82.2 mass % of acrylic acid, and 7.8 mass % of other impurities.<br>
[0074]<br>
The resultant acrylic acid showed a purity of 99.4 mass %.<br>
The purification yield of acrylic acid was 96.0 %.<br>
[0075]<br>
In this Example 7, although no special operation other<br>
than mixing the purified acrylic acid was carried out, the<br>
purified acrylic acid having high purity could be produced as<br>
described above.<br>
[0076]<br><example><br>
The acrylic acid-containing gas 12 obtained by the<br>
catalytic gas phase oxidation method was subjected to<br>
counter-flow contact with the absorption liquid 15 in the<br>
absorption column 14 to obtain the acrylic acid-containing<br>
solution 16. Since the acrylic acid-containing solution 16 had<br>
a high concentration of water up to 20.0 mass %, the acrylic<br>
acid-containing solution 16 was stored in the intermediate tank<br>
24 (the stored acrylic acid-containing solution) . The operation<br>
for accumulation was continued until the concentration of water<br>
in the acrylic acid-containing solution 16 became 10 mass % or<br>
less. Then, it was confirmed that the concentration of water<br>
in the acrylic acid-containing solution 16 discharged from the<br>
absorption column 14 became 10 mass % or less and could be<br>
obtained in a stable manner. The liquid composition of the<br>
acrylic acid-containing solution (the stored acrylic<br>
acid-containing solution) stored in the intermediate tank 24<br>
thus far comprised 77.0 mass % of acrylic acid, 15.0 mass % of<br><br>
water and 8.0 mass % of other impurities.<br>
[0077]<br>
Next, the stored acrylic acid-containing solution in the<br>
intermediate tank 24 was supplied from the line 28 to the<br>
absorption column 14. The amount of the stored acrylic<br>
acid-containing solution supplied then was 20 mass % of a total<br>
amount of the absorption liquid, and a usual absorption liquid<br>
was used for the rest of the total amount of the absorption<br>
liquid.<br>
[0078]<br>
The liquid composition of the acrylic acid-containing<br>
solution 16 thus obtained from the absorption column 14<br>
comprised 89.0 mass % of acrylic acid, 6.0 mass % of water and<br>
5.0 mass % of other impurities. The acrylic acid-containing<br>
solution 16 was supplied to the crystallizer 19 for<br>
crystallization.<br>
[0079]<br>
The resultant acrylic acid showed a purity of 99.4 mass %,<br>
and the purification yield of acrylic acid was 99.9 %.<br>
[0080]<br>
In this Example 8, although no special operation was<br>
carried out except that the acrylic acid-containing solution<br>
containing more than 10.0 mass % of water was brought back to<br>
the absorption column as the absorption liquid, the purified<br>
acrylic acid having high purity could be produced in good yield<br>
as described above.<br>
[0081]<br><example><br>
The acrylic acid-containing gas 12 obtained by the<br>
catalytic gas phase oxidation method was subjected to<br>
counter-flow contact with the absorption liquid 15 in the<br>
absorption column 14 to obtain the acrylic acid-containing<br>
solution 16. Since the acrylic acid-containing solution 16 had<br>
a high concentration of water up to 20.0 mass %, the acrylic<br>
acid-containing solution 16 was stored in the intermediate tank<br>
24 (the stored acrylic acid-containing solution). This<br><br>
operation for accumulation was continued until the<br>
concentration of water in the acrylic acid-containing solution<br>
16 became 8 mass %. The liquid composition of the acrylic<br>
acid-containing solution (the stored acrylic acid-containing<br>
solution) thus stored in the intermediate tank 24 comprised 75.0<br>
mass % of acrylic acid, 14.0 mass % of water and 11.0 mass %<br>
of other impurities.<br>
[0082]<br>
Next, the stored acrylic acid-containing solution in the<br>
intermediate tank 24 was mixed from the line 35 in the acrylic<br>
acid-containing solution 16 (containing 8 mass % or less of<br>
water) of the line 38. The mixing mass ratio of the acrylic<br>
acid-containing solution to the stored acrylic acid-containing<br>
solution was 2:1. The liquid composition of the mixture<br>
comprised 81.7 mass % of acrylic acid, 10.0 mass % of water,<br>
and 8.3 mass % of other impurities.<br>
[0083]<br>
The mixture was supplied to the crystallizer 19 for<br>
crystallization. The resultant acrylic acid showed a purity of<br>
99.4 mass %, and the purification yield of acrylic acid was<br>
96.0 %.<br>
[0084]<br>
In this Example 9, although no special operation was<br>
carried out except that the acrylic acid-containing solution<br>
containing more than 10. 0 mass % of water was temporarily stored,<br>
and that the stored acrylic acid-containing solution was mixed<br>
in the acrylic acid-containing solution 16 containing 8 mass %<br>
or less of water, the purified acrylic acid having high purity<br>
could be produced as described above.<br>
[0085]<br>
In summary of the above results of experiments,<br>
separation and purification by crystallization could not be<br>
carried out smoothly in Examples 5 and 6, while could be carried<br>
out smoothly in the crystallizer 19 to obtain the purified<br>
acrylic acid having high purity in Examples 1 to 4 and 7 to 9.<br>
With respect to the yield, a high yield was obtained in Examples<br><br>
1 to 4 and 8, but in Examples 7 and 9 in which an acrylic<br>
acid-containing solution having a concentration of water of<br>
10.0 mass % was crystallized, the yield was somewhat inferior<br>
to that of Examples 1 to 4 and 8. From the results of the<br>
experiments, it is found that by making the concentration of<br>
water 10 mass % or less using the above measures [a] to [d] when<br>
the acrylic acid-containing solution contains more than 10<br>
mass % of water, the crystallization process can be progressed<br>
smoothly, and even more, a high yield can be obtained.<br>
[0086]<br>
Although the above examples showed methods for producing<br>
acrylic acid, the present invention can also be applied to<br>
methacrylic acid in a same manner.<br>
[0087]<br>
According to the present invention, even if the<br>
(meth)acrylic acid-containing solution contains more than 10<br>
mass % of water, which is an unsteady state, (meth) acrylic acid<br>
can be collected from the (meth)acrylic acid-containing<br>
solution without any special operation, and the purified<br>
acrylic acid having high purity can be obtained at high yield<br>
with less loss in the (meth) acrylic acid production process as<br>
a whole. Moreover, the steps are easy and simple, and elevation<br>
of cost arising on the occasions such as disposal or the<br>
additional water separation operation as described above is not<br>
induced. This application is based on Japanese Patent<br>
Application No. 2006-254955 filed on September 20, 2006, the<br>

to provide a method for collecting the purified acrylic acid<br>
having high purity in good yield even in an unsteady state.<br>
When the acrylic acid-containing solutions 18 and 16 have<br>
a concentration of water higher than 10 mass % (unsteady state) ,<br>

water is mixed therewith to make the concentration of water 10<br>
mass % or less[a] [b] . Alternatively, when the acrylic<br>
acid-containing solutions 18 and 16 have a concentration of<br>
water higher than 10 mass %, it is used as an absorption liquid<br>
[c]. Thereafter, the crystallization process is carried out.<br></example></example></example></example></example></example></example></example></example></td>
