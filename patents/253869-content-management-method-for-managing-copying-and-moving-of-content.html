				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
CONTENT MANAGEMENT METHOD AND<br>
-.CONTENT MANAGEMENT APPARATUS<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a content<br>
management method for managing copyrighted content<br>
which is put into an electronic form and an apparatus<br>
for implementation thereof, and in particular, the<br>
present invention makes it possible to manage<br>
content with a restriction imposed on copying and<br>
moving thereof in an easily understandable form to<br>
users.<br>
Background Art<br>
Recently, there has been an increasing demand<br>
for digital content distribution services making<br>
use of communications or broadcasting.<br>
For example, music distribution services<br>
have now started to be provided, such as one in which<br>
music data is downloaded to a cellular phone to be<br>
stored into a storage medium connected thereto, and<br>
the music data is played back on the cellular phone<br>
or other playback device whenever it is demanded.<br>
In addition, other than music data, a distribution<br>
service for video data such as a movie, etc., or<br><br>
document data such as newspaper, account s , etc., has<br>
also been conceived.<br>
In a system which distributes content<br>
electronically, it is an important issue how to<br>
prevent unauthorized use of stored content or<br>
unauthorized copying thereof from occurring for the<br>
protection of a right of a copyright holder. Though<br>
it goes without saying that it is necessary to provide<br>
a scheme which eliminates the risk of unauthorized<br>
copying or tampering, especially, these days, there<br>
has been a growing importance of a freer content<br>
use control scheme which also controls number of<br>
times of content viewing.<br>
As a conventional digital content use control<br>
scheme, the invention described in Japanese<br>
Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 2000-315177<br>
(hereafter referred to as the conventional scheme)<br>
is known.<br>
An explanation is given below on the outline<br>
of the conventional scheme. The conventional scheme<br>
is a content management method for restricting the<br>
number of content copies copied into storage media,<br>
where an allowed number of copies k is set for each<br>
of content, and a restriction is imposed on the<br>
copying of content so that the number of storage<br>
media in which the content is copied does not exceed<br>
k at the same time.<br><br>
FIG. 1 illustrates a conceptual diagram of<br>
a content use model according to the conventional<br>
scheme where k - 3. A content use management system<br>
(PC) stores the a 1lowed number of copiable content<br>
for each of content and identification information<br>
of storage media where copied content are stored<br>
(as an accommodation book). Upon reception of<br>
instructions for copying and storing of distributed<br>
content into a storage medium, a copied content is<br>
stored into the storage medium in a case where there<br>
is a remaining balance in the allowed number of<br>
copiable content for this content. At such an<br><br>
occasion, each time a copied content is stored into<br>
storage medium, the allowed number of copiable<br>
content is decremented by one (check-out).<br>
In addition, upon the reception of<br>
instructions for erasing of copied content from the<br>
storage medium, the copied content is erased from<br>
the storage medium, and the allowed number of<br>
copiable content is incremented by one at each time<br>
of erasing a copied content (check-in). At such an<br>
occasion, only in a case where the identification<br>
information of the storage medium is stored in the<br>
"accommodation book", the copied content is erased<br>
from the storage medium.<br>
In an example of FIG. 1, because a<br>
predetermined allowed number of copiable content<br><br><br>
k for for content is "3", it is possible to perform<br>
checkouts to three storage media at the maximum at<br>
the same time. Furthermore, the allowed number of<br>
copiable content is incremented by one by checking<br>
in checked-out content, therefore it is possible<br>
to perform a checkout to another storage medium.<br>
In addition, in this content use model,<br>
content which is checked out to a storage medium<br>
is unable to be checked into another content use<br>
management system other than the original content<br>
use management system from which the content is<br>
checked out.<br>
In this way, according to this system, it is<br>
possible to impose strict limitations on copied<br>
content through management of check-ins and<br>
checkouts.<br>
However, it is often that a content use<br>
management scheme by means of check-ins and<br>
checkouts, especially its concept of check-in, is<br>
hard for users to become familiar with it, ending<br>
up being a cause of a hindrance to making content<br>
distribution services popular.<br>
Moreover, according to a check-in/checkout<br>
scheme, it is difficult to embody a control mode<br>
which restricts the viewing count of content, etc.,<br>
by affixing use restriction information which<br>
prescribes the allowed playback count of the content,<br><br><br>
etc., to the content. For example, in a case where<br>
a checkout to a storage medium is performed with<br>
use restriction information which restricts the<br>
allowed playback count of content affixed thereto,<br>
the following problem would arise.<br>
By playing back copied content in a storage<br>
medium, the allowed playback count of the content<br>
decreases, meanwhile, by playing the content back,<br>
the allowed playback count at a content use<br>
management system side also varies in accordance<br>
with its number of times of playbacks. In this way,<br>
due to the difference in the number of times of<br>
playbacks after checkout, there is a discrepancy<br>
between the value of the allowed playback count of<br>
the content at the content use management system<br>
side and the value of the allowed playback count<br>
of the content at the storage medium side. For this<br>
reason, there arises a problem regarding which value<br>
the allowed playback count should be adjusted to<br>
when checking content at the storage medium side<br>
in. In addition, regardless of which value it is<br>
adjusted to, it is inevitable that such a content<br>
use model would be far harder one to be understood<br>
by users, as well as the greater complexity in<br>
processing on equipment.<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br><br><br>
The object of the present invention is to<br>
solve such convent ional problems , aiming to provide<br>
a content management method and an apparatus for<br>
implementation thereof which manages content in an<br>
easily understandable form for users, and also<br>
manages the copying and moving of content with use<br>
restriction information affixed thereto.<br>
This object is achieved by updating<br>
additional information of content at the time of<br>
the copying and moving of the content, and having<br>
the management of the copying and moving of the<br>
content thereafter be performed by equipment which<br>
handles the content based on the updated additional<br>
information.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying out the Invention<br>
Embodiments of the present invention will be<br>
described below. Incidentally, the present<br>
invention is in no case limited to these embodiments;<br>
the present invention is able to be exploited in<br>
various kinds of modes within the range where the<br><br><br>
gist of the present invention is maintained.<br>
(Embodiment 1)<br>
In Embodiment 1, a content management system<br>
which manages the copying of content is explained.<br>
As illustrated in FIG. 2, this system<br>
comprises storage medium 120 in which content is<br>
stored, and content management apparatus 110 which<br>
controls the storing and copying of the content.<br>
Content management apparatus 110 has readout<br>
section 111 that reads data out of storage medium<br>
120, write-in section 112 that writes data into<br>
storage medium 120, copy control section 113 that<br>
controls content copy processing from content<br>
management apparatus 110 to storage medium 120, and<br>
content copy processing from storage medium 120 to<br>
content management apparatus 110, and data storage<br>
section 114 that stores content and various<br>
additional information for the content.<br>
In addition, storage medium 120 has normal<br>
area 121 which is used for the storing of content,<br>
and protective area 122 which is used for the rtoring<br>
of various additional information for the content<br>
stored in normal area 121. This protective anrea 122<br>
is a special area which is protected so that a user<br>
will not be able to execute write-in / readout thereon<br>
directly.<br><br>
In this system, content stored in storage<br>
medium 120 is copied to be stored into data storage<br>
section 114 of content management apparatus 110,<br>
or content stored in data storage section 114 of<br>
content management apparatus 110 is copied to be<br>
stored into storage medium 120.<br>
The copying of content is managed based on<br>
additional information of the content. When content<br>
is copied, additional information retained in a copy<br>
origin is subjected to updating in accordance with<br>
a predetermined rule, and also additional<br>
information updated in accordance with a<br>
predetermined rule is retained at a copy target.<br>
For example, in a case where the content stored in<br>
data storage section 114 of content management<br>
apparatus 110 is copied into storage medium 120,<br>
the additional information stored in data storage<br>
section 114 of the copy origin is updated, whereas<br>
additional information updated in accordance with<br>
the predetermined rule is also stored in protective<br>
area 122 of storage medium 120 of the copy target.<br>
The approval/disapproval of further copying<br>
of the content stored in storage medium 120 is managed<br>
by the additional information stored in storage<br>
medium 120. At this occasion, unlike the<br>
conventional scheme, content management apparatus<br>
110 at the copy origin does not get involved in the<br><br><br>
management of the content after copying at all<br>
Content management apparatus 110 just performs a<br>
new copying of the content stored in data storage<br>
section 114 based on the updated additional<br>
information.<br>
This copy processing according to additional<br>
information and updating processing of the<br>
additional information is executed by copy control<br>
section 113 of content management apparatus 110.<br>
The operation of copy control section 113 is<br>
implemented by a program for having a computer<br>
function as copy control section 113.<br>
Next, using a specific example, the 1st<br>
content use model according to this embodiment and<br>
processing of a content management system with such<br>
a model is explained. The 1st content use model is<br>
a model which disables further copying of copied<br>
content.<br>
First of all, content management apparatus<br>
110 acquires distributed content and its additional<br>
information with use of some means, and stores them<br>
into data storage section 114. This acquisition may<br>
be done through wired or wireless. data<br>
communications means, or with use of broadcasting<br>
reception means. Alternatively, they may be loaded<br>
from an information storage medium.<br>
FIG. 3 is a diagram illustrating one example<br><br><br>
of content 201 and its additional information 202<br>
acquired by content management apparatus 110.<br>
Various kinds of content are conceivable, such as<br>
music data, video data, image data, document data,<br>
and so forth, and the type of content is not<br>
specifically confined herein. In addition, as<br>
additional information, allowed copy count control<br>
information is associated with content. The allowed<br>
copy count control information is information which<br>
represents how many copies are allowed to be created<br>
out of the associated content. Here, the allowed<br>
copy count is taken to be 10.<br>
It is noted that content 201 and additional<br>
information 202 stored in data storage section 114<br>
is assumed to be stored securely so that it cannot<br>
be tampered by any user. As its storage method, it<br>
is conceivable to employ the secure management<br>
achieved by means of tamper-resistant software or<br>
the encryption using ID which is unique to the<br>
hardware of content management apparatus 110 and<br>
so forth, and its method is not specifically confined<br>
herein.<br>
Next, an explanation is given on processing<br>
at copy control section 113 in a case where<br>
instructions are given by a user for copying content<br>
201 stored in content management apparatus 110 into<br>
storage medium 120. FIG. 4 is a diagram illustrating<br><br><br>
the processing flow of content copying at copy<br><br>
control section 113 in such a case. <br><br>
Step 301: Allowed copy count control<br>
information at a copy origin is referred to, and<br>
if the allowed copy count is 0, the processing is<br>
aborted. In the case of this example (FIG. 3) , because<br>
the allowed copy count associated with content 201<br>
is "10", the processing goes to step 302 without<br>
aborting.<br>
Step 302: In a case where the allowed copy<br>
count control information at the copy origin is<br>
"infinite", the processing skips step 303 to move<br>
onto step 304. Because it is not a value indicating<br>
"infinite" in the case of this example, the<br>
processing goes to step 303.<br>
Step 303: The allowed copy count at the copy<br>
origin is decremented by one. In the case of this<br>
example, the allowed copy count is decremented from<br>
"10" to "9" and it is set again.<br>
Step 304: The allowed copy count at the copy<br>
target is set into "0." In the case of this example,<br>
the allowed copy count is set as "0" at protective<br>
area 122 of storage medium 120 which is the copy<br>
target.<br>
Step 305: Content proper is copied into the<br>
copy target. In the case of this example, a copy<br>
of content 201 stored in data storage section 114<br><br><br>
of content management apparatus 110 is stored in<br>
normal area 121 of storage medium 120 which is the<br>
copy target. At such an occasion, the content is<br>
subjected to encryption for storage so that it will<br>
not be able to be used, copied, and exploited in<br>
other way, without due authorization. A content<br>
encryption key used in such an occasion is stored<br>
in protective area 122.<br>
FIG. 5 is a diagram illustrating the<br>
configuration of data stored in a storage medium<br>
after a copy processing stage in this example. As<br>
illustrated in FIG. 5, it is also possible to enhance<br>
security against an attack from a malicious user<br>
by bringing the allowed copy count control<br>
information and an encryption key for encrypting<br>
the content proper together and by encrypting them<br>
using an encryption key unique to the storage medium<br>
to store them into protective area 122. Moreover,<br>
at the time of encryption and storing into the<br>
protection area, it is possible to further heighten<br>
security by performing encryption and storage with<br>
a check value for detecting the tampering of<br>
information inserted therein.<br>
Reference numeral 501 in FIG. 6 shows a<br>
conceptual diagram of the 1st content use model in<br>
this embodiment. As illustrated with reference<br>
numeral 501 of FIG. 6, the 1st content use model<br><br><br>
according to this embodiment is a model which<br>
disables the further copying of content from the<br>
copy target (hereafter referred to as a sub-copy),<br>
achieved by setting the allowed copy count control<br>
information at the copy target into a value<br>
indicating that the further copying is disabled.<br>
It is noted that, according to the content<br>
copy processing flow illustrated in FIG. 4, in a<br>
case where the allowed copy count at the copy origin<br>
is other than "0", the allowed copy count control<br>
information at the copy target is always set at step<br>
304 into a value indicating that further copying<br>
is disabled, which prohibits a sub-copy, however,<br>
it is possible to realize another content use model<br>
which allows infinite copying as illustrated witli<br>
reference numeral 502 in FIG. 6 by setting the allowed<br>
copy count of the copy target into a value indicating<br>
"infinite" in a case where the allowed copy count<br>
of the copy origin is a value indicating "infinite"<br>
in step 3 8 2.<br>
Next, using a specific example, the 2nd<br>
content use model according to this embodiment and<br>
processing of a content management system with such<br>
a model is explained. The 2nd content use model is<br>
a model which manages the aggregate number of copies.<br>
Here, in the same manner as done in the<br>
explanation of the 1st content use model, an<br><br><br>
explanation is given on processing at copy control<br>
section 113 in a case where instructions are given<br>
by a user for copying content 201 stored in content<br>
management apparatus 110 into,storage medium 120.<br>
FIG. 7 is a diagram illustrating the processing flow<br>
of content copying at copy control section 113 in<br>
a case of the 2nd content use model.<br>
Step 601: In a case where the allowed copy<br>
count of the copy origin is not "0" as in the same<br>
manner as step 301 of FIG. 4,<br>
Step 602: In a case where the allowed copy<br>
count control information at the copy origin is<br>
"infinite", the processing goes to step 6 04;<br>
otherwise it goes to step 603. Because it is not<br>
a value indicating "infinite" in the case of this<br>
example, the processing goes to step 603.<br>
Step 603: The values of allowed copy count<br>
restriction information at the copy origin and at<br>
the copy target are set so that the total of the<br>
allowed copy counts of the copy origin and the copy<br>
target after copy processing equals to the allowed<br>
copy count of the copy origin before the copy<br>
processing minus 1. In the case of this example,<br>
because the allowed copy count at the copy origin<br>
before the copy processing is "10", and "10 - 1 =<br>
9", the values after the copy processing are set<br>
in such a manner that, for example, the allowed copy<br><br><br>
Count at the copy origin is "4", while the allowed<br>
copy count at the copy target is "5" Herein, how<br>
 the allowed copy count is allocated is supposed to<br>
be specified by an input by a user.<br>
Step 604: In a case where the allowed copy<br>
count control information at the copy origin is<br>
"infinite" in step 602, the value of the allowed<br>
copy count control information at the copy target<br>
is also set as "infinite."<br>
Step 605: In the same manner as done in step<br>
305 of FIG. 4, content proper is copied into the<br>
copy target.<br>
Reference numeral 503 in FIG. 6 shows a<br>
conceptual diagram of the 2nd content use model in<br>
this embodiment. As illustrated with reference<br>
numeral 503 in FIG. 6, the 2nd content use model is<br>
a model which is able to manage the total number<br>
of copies in a case where repetitive copying of<br>
distributed content is performed within a range<br>
restricted by allowed copy count control information,<br>
which is achieved by setting the values of allowed<br>
copy count restriction information at the copy<br>
origin and at the copy target at tire time of copy<br>
execution so that the total of the allowed copy counts<br>
of the copy origin and the copy target becomes equal<br>
to the allowed copy count of the copy origin before<br>
the copy processing minus 1.<br><br>
It is noted that, in the content copy<br>
processing flow illustrated in FIG. 7, the value<br>
of the allowed copy count at the copy target is set<br>
to be "infinite" at, step 604 in a case where the<br>
value of the allowed copy count at the copy origin<br>
is a value indicating "infinite" at step 602, however,<br>
it is also possible herein to conceive a model which<br>
con fines the origin of copy dissemination to a single<br>
content with infinite number of total copies, which<br>
is achieved by setting either one of the allowed<br>
copy count at the copy origin or at the copy target<br>
to be "infinite", while the other one being set as<br>
" 0 . "<br>
Next, using a specific example, the 3rd<br>
content use model according to this embodiment and<br>
processing of a content management system with such<br>
a model is explained. The 3rd content use model is<br>
a model which specifies up to how many generations<br>
downward copying is allowed.<br>
Here, an explanation is given on processing<br>
at copy control section 113 in a case where<br>
instructions are given by a user for copying content<br>
701 of FIG. 8 into storage medium 120 on the<br>
assumption that data as illustrated in FIG. 8 is<br>
stored securely in data storage section 114 of<br>
content management apparatus 110.<br>
As its additional information, copy<br><br>
generation management information is newly<br>
associated with content 701 illustrated in FIG. 8.<br>
The copy generation management information is<br>
information which represents up to how many<br>
generations copies are allowed to be created out<br>
of the associated content. FIG. 9 is a diagram<br>
illustrating the processing flow of content copying<br>
at copy control section 113 in a case of the 3rd content<br>
use model according to this embodiment.<br>
Step 801: Allowed copy count control<br>
information and copy generation management<br>
information at a copy origin are referred to, and<br>
if either one is '0", or the both are "0", the<br>
processing is aborted. Because neither of them is<br>
"0" in the case of this example, the processing goes<br>
to step 802.<br>
Step 8 02 : In a case where the copy generation<br>
management information at the copy origin is<br>
"infinite", the processing goes to step 804;<br>
otherwise it goes to step 803. Because it is not<br>
a value indicating "infinite" in the case of this<br>
example, the processing goes to step 803.<br>
Step 803: The copy generation management<br>
information at the copy target is set into a value<br>
which is smaller than the copy generation management<br>
information at the copy origin by 1. In the case<br>
of this example, as the copy generation management<br><br>
information at the copy origin is "2", the copy<br>
generation management in formation at the copy target<br>
is setto be "1", and the set information is stored<br>
into protective area 122 of,storage medium 120 which<br>
is the copy target.<br>
Step 804: In a case where the copy generation<br>
management information at the copy origin is<br>
"infinite" in step 802, the value of the copy<br>
generation management information at the copy target<br>
is also set as "infinite."<br>
Step 805: The allowed copy count at the copy<br>
target is set into the same value as the allowed<br>
copy count at the copy origin. In the case of this<br>
example, the allowed copy count at the copy origin<br>
"10" is set without any change as the allowed copy<br>
count at the copy target, and it is stored into<br>
protective area 122.<br>
Step 806: In a case where the allowed copy<br>
count control information at the copy origin is<br>
"infinite", the processing skips step 807 to move<br>
onto step 808. Because it is not a value indicating<br>
"infinite" in the case of this example, the<br>
processing goes to step 807.<br>
Step 807: The allowed copy count at the copy<br>
origin is decremented by one. In the case of this<br>
example, the allowed copy count is decremented from<br>
"10" to "9" and it is set again.<br><br>
Step 808: In the same manner as done in step<br>
305 of FIG. 4, content proper is copied into the<br>
copy target.<br>
Reference numeral 901 in FIG. 10 shows a<br>
conceptual diagram of the 3rd content use model in<br>
this embodiment. As illustrated with reference<br>
numeral 901 in FIG. 10, the 3rd content use model<br>
according to this embodiment is a model which<br>
disables copying thereafter at the time when the<br>
value of the content generation management<br>
information reaches to "0", which realizes copy<br>
generation management of distributed content.<br>
It is noted that, according to the content<br>
copy processing flow illustrated in FIG. 9, the<br>
allowed copy count at the copy target is set to be<br>
the same value as the allowed copy count at the copy<br>
origin in step 805, and the allowed copy count at<br>
the copy origin is subsequently decremented by one,<br>
however, as in step 603 of the 2nd content use model,<br>
it is also possible to implement a content use model<br>
which sets the values of allowed copy counts at the<br>
copy origin and at the copy target so that the total<br>
of the allowed copy counts of the copy origin and<br>
the copy target after copy processing becomes equal<br>
to the allowed copy count of the copy origin before<br>
the copy processing minus 1 (refer to reference<br>
numeral 902 in FIG. 10).<br><br>
As described above, according to a content<br>
management system of this embodiment, it is possible<br>
to control the number of times of copying of<br>
distributed content by managing the allowed copy<br>
count information on the content and by updating<br>
the allowed copy count of the copy origin so that<br>
it becomes smaller than before copy processing.<br>
Furthermore, it is possible to implement a content<br>
use model which prohibits a sub-copy by setting the<br>
allowed copy count control information at the copy<br>
target into a value indicating that copying is<br>
disabled.<br>
In addition, it is possible to implement a<br>
content use model which is able to manage the total<br>
number of copies in a case where repetitive copying<br>
of distributed content is performed within a range<br>
restricted by al lowed copy count control information,<br>
which is achieved by setting the values of allowed<br>
copy count restriction information at the copy<br>
origin and at the copy target at the time of copy<br>
execution so that the total of the allowed copy counts<br>
of the copy origin and the copy target becomes equal<br>
to the allowed copy count at the copy origin before<br>
the copy processing minus 1.<br>
Moreover, it is possible to realize copy<br>
generation management of content by managing copy<br>
generation management information on the content<br><br>
and by setting the copy generation management<br>
information at the copy target to be smaller than<br>
	.<br>
the copy generation management information at the<br>
copy origin. <br>
It is noVed that, though it is assumed in the<br>
explanation given in this embodiment that allowed<br>
copy count control information and copy generation<br>
management information are counters whose values<br>
decrease at each time of copying, these may be<br>
implemented with a method in which each counter has<br>
two values, which are the maximum value and current<br>
value, where the current value is increased at each<br>
time of copying, and copying is then disabled at<br>
the time when the current value becomes equal to<br>
the maximum value. <br>
Alternatively, allowed copy count control<br>
information may be flags indicating statuses, for<br>
example, indicating (1) copy disabled (2) copying<br>
allowed only once (3) copying allowed infinitely,<br>
instead of a counter like the above.<br>
In addition, copy generation management<br>
information may also be flags indicating statuses,<br>
for example, indicating (1) copy disabled (2)<br>
cop ying allowed across only one generation (3)<br>
copying allowed across infinite generations,<br>
instead of a counter like the above.<br>
It is noted that, in this embodiment, an<br><br>
explanation is provided on the assumption that a<br>
content management apparatus is a copy origin,<br>
whereas a storage medium is a copy target, however,<br>
it is also possible to implement copy processing•'<br>
in which a storage medium is a copy origin, whereas<br>
a content management apparatus is a copy target,<br>
achieved by managing allowed copy count control<br>
information and copy generation management<br>
information according to the same rules as described<br>
above at the copy origin and the copy target.<br>
Additionally, though the copying of content<br>
proper is performed at the last step respectively<br>
according to the copy processing flows illustrated<br>
in FIG. 4, FIG. 7, and FIG. 9, the copying of the<br>
content proper may be performed at the first step<br>
each. Even at such an occasion, the content is<br>
subjected to encryption for storage so that there<br>
is no risk of use, copying, and exploitation in other<br>
way without due authorization.<br>
(Embodiment 2 )<br>
In Embodiment 2, a content management system<br>
which manages the moving of content is explained.<br>
Incidental ly, the moving process ing of content means<br>
that content subjected to moving processing is not<br>
retained (thus unusable) at its move source, and<br>
upon execution of the moving processing, content<br><br>
use becomes available only at its move destination<br>
out of the move source and the move destination.<br>
According to this system, as illustrated in<br>
FIG. 11, content management apparatus 110 comprises<br>
move control section 115 that controls content move<br>
processing from content management apparatus 110<br>
to storage medium 120, and content move processing<br>
from storage medium 120 to content management<br>
apparatus 110, in place of a copy control section.<br>
Except for that mentioned above, the configuration<br>
is the same as that of Embodiment 1 (FIG. 2).<br>
The moving of content is managed based on<br>
additional information of the content in a similar<br>
manner as done in "copying" of Embodiment 1. When<br>
content is moved, additional information retained<br>
in a move source is subjected to updating in<br>
accordance with a predetermined rule to be<br>
transferred to a move destination, and moving<br>
thereafter is managed based on the updated<br>
additional information. For example, in a case where<br>
the content stored in data storage section 114 of<br>
content management apparatus 110 is moved to storage<br>
medium 120, the additional information stored in<br>
data storage section 114 of the move source is updated<br>
in accordance with the predetermined rule to be<br>
stored in protective area 122 of storage medium 120<br>
of the move destination, and further moving of the<br><br>
content stored in storage medium 120 is managed based<br>
on the additional information stored in storage<br>
medium 120. Content management apparatus 110 at the<br>
move source does not get involved in the management<br>
of the content after moving at all.<br>
This move processing according to additional<br>
information and updating processing of the<br>
additional information is executed by move control<br>
section 115 of content management apparatus 110.<br>
The operation of move control section 115 is<br>
implemented by a program for having a computer<br>
function as move control section 115.<br>
Next, using a specific example, the 1st<br>
content use model according to this embodiment and<br>
processing of a content management system with such<br>
a model is explained. The 1st content use model is<br>
a model which limits the move count of content.<br>
First of all, content management apparatus<br>
11.0 acquires content and its additional information<br>
which are distributed with use of some means as done<br>
in Embodiment 1, and stores them securely into data<br>
storage section 114.<br>
FIG. 12 is a diagram illustxating one example<br>
of content 1101 and its additional information 1102<br>
acquired by content management apparatus 110. The<br>
difference from Embodiment 1 lies in that allowed<br>
move count control information instead of allowed<br><br>
copy count control information is associated with<br>
content. The allowed move count control information<br>
is information which represents how many moves of<br>
the associated content are remaining to be allowed.<br>
Next, an explanation is given on processing<br>
at move control section 115 in a case where<br>
instructions are given by a user for moving content<br>
1101 stored in content management apparatus 110 to<br>
storage medium 120. FIG. 13 is a diagram illustrating<br>
the processing flow of content moving at move control<br>
section 115.<br>
Step 1201: Allowed move count control<br>
information at a move source is referred to, and<br>
if the allowed move count is 0, the processing is<br>
aborted. In the case of this example, because the<br>
allowed move count associated with content 1101 is<br>
n2", the processing goes to step 1202 without<br>
aborting.<br>
Step 1202: In a case where the allowed move<br>
count control information at the move source is<br>
"infinite", the processing goes to step 1204;<br>
otherwise it goes to step 1203. Because it is not<br>
a value indicating "infinite" in the case of this<br>
example, the processing goes to step 1203.<br>
Step 1203: The al lowed move count at the move<br>
destination is set into a value decremented by one<br>
from the allowed move count at the move source. In<br><br>
the case of this example, because the allowed move<br>
count at the move source is "2", the allowed move<br>
count at the move destination is set to be "1".<br>
-Step 1204: In a case where the allowed move<br>
count control information at the move source is<br>
"infinite" in step 1202, the value of the allowed<br>
move count control information at the move<br>
destination is also set as "infinite."<br>
Step 1205: Content proper is moved to the move<br>
destination. In the case of this example, a copy<br>
of content 1101 stored in data storage section 114<br>
of content management apparatus 110 is stored in<br>
normal area 121 of storage medium 120 which is the<br>
move destination, and original content 1101 stored<br>
in content management apparatus 110 which is the<br>
move source is put into a state not available for<br>
use permanently (e.g. deleted from data storage<br>
section 114). At such an occasion, as done in a case<br>
of copying, the move content is subjected to<br>
encryption for storage so that it will not be able<br>
to be used, moved, and exploited in other way, without<br>
due authorization. An encryption key used in such<br>
an occasion is stored in protective area 122.<br>
FIG. 14 is a diagram illustrating the<br>
configuration of data stored in a storage medium<br>
after a move processing stage in this example. As<br>
done in Embodiment 1, it is also possible to enhance<br><br>
security against an attack from a malicious user<br>
by bringing the allowed move. count eontrol<br>
information and an encryption key for encrypting<br>
the content proper together and by encrypting them<br>
using an encryption key unique to the storage medium<br>
to store them into protective area 122. Moreover,<br>
at the time of encryption and storing into the<br>
protection area, it is possible to further heighten<br>
security by performing encryption and storage with<br>
a check value for detecting the tampering of<br>
information inserted therein.<br>
Reference numeral 1410 in FIG. 15 shows a<br>
conceptual diagram of the 1st content use model in<br>
this embodiment. As illustrated with reference<br>
numeral 1410 in FIG. 15, the 1st content use model<br>
is a model which decrements the value of allowed<br>
move count at each moving of content, and disables<br>
moving thereafter at the time when the value of the<br>
allowed move count reaches to "0", which realizes<br>
the controlling of move counts of distributed<br>
content.<br>
It is noted that, in the explanation given<br>
on the 1st content use model of this embodiment, it<br>
is assumed that a content management apparatus is<br>
a move source, whereas a storage medium is a move<br>
destination, however, it is also possible to<br>
implement move processing in which a storage medium<br><br>
is a move source, whereas a. content management<br>
apparatus is* a move destination, achieved with the<br>
flow illustrated in FIG. 13.<br>
As described above, according to a content<br>
move processing flow illustrated in FIG. 13, though<br>
the content use model is assumed to be a model which<br>
decrements allowed move count both in cases where<br>
content is moved from a content management apparatus<br>
to a storage medium and where content is moved from<br>
a storage medium to a content management apparatus,<br>
it is possible to conceive another content use model<br>
(the 2nd content use model in this embodiment) which,<br>
as illustrated with reference numeral 1420 in FIG.<br>
15, decrements allowed move count in a case where<br>
content is moved from a storage medium to a content<br>
management apparatus only, without decrementing the<br>
allowed move count in a case where content is moved<br>
from a content management apparatus to a storage<br>
medium. In such a conception, it is regarded that<br>
one execution of move processing (rather than two<br>
times of executions) occurs when a move from storage<br>
medium 1421 to storage medium 1423 is completed while<br>
having content management apparatus 1422 serve as<br>
a bridge, and the conception thereby realizes a<br>
content use model which decrements allowed move<br>
countonlybyone.<br>
In addition, opposite to the 2nd content use<br><br>
model in this embodiment, it is possible to conceive<br>
further another content use model (the 3rd content,<br>
use model in this embodiment) which, as illustrated<br>
with reference numeral 1430 in FIG. 15, decrements;<br>
allowed move count in a case where content is moved<br>
from a content management apparatus to a storage<br>
medium only, without decrementing the allowed move<br>
count in a case where content is moved from a storage<br>
medium to a content management apparatus. In such<br>
a conception, it is regarded that one execution of<br>
move processing, rather than two times of executions,<br>
occurs when a move from content management apparatus<br>
1431 to content management apparatus 1433 is<br>
completed while having storage medium 1432 serve<br>
as a bridge, and the conception thereby realizes<br>
a content use model which decrements allowed move<br>
count only by one.<br>
As described above, according to a system of<br>
this embodiment, it is possible to control the number<br>
of times of moving of distributed content by managing<br>
the allowed move count control information on the<br>
content and by setting the allowed move count in<br>
such a manner that it is decremented at each moving<br>
of the content.<br>
On one hand, by decrementing allowed move<br>
count in a case where content is moved from a storage<br>
medium to a content management apparatus only,<br><br>
without decrementing the allowed move count in a<br>
case where content is moved from a content management<br>
apparatus to a storage medium, it becomes possible<br>
to realize a cfontent use model which regards that<br>
one execution of move processing occurs at a time<br>
when a move from the first storage medium to the<br>
second storage medium is completed while having a<br>
content management apparatus serve as a bridge. On<br>
the other hand, by decrementing allowed move count<br>
in a case where content is moved from a content<br>
management apparatus to a storage medium only,<br>
without decrementing the allowed move count in a<br>
case where content is moved from a storage medium<br>
to a content management apparatus, it becomes<br>
possible to realize a content use model which regards<br>
that one execution of move processing occurs at a<br>
time when a move from the first content management<br>
apparatus to the second content management apparatus<br>
is completed while having a storage medium serve<br>
as a bridge.<br>
It is noted that, though it is assumed in the<br>
explanation given in this embodiment that allowed<br>
move count control information is a counter whose<br>
value decreases at each time of moving, this may<br>
be implemented with a method in which the counter<br>
has two values, which are the maximum value and<br>
current value, where the current value is increased<br><br>
at each time of moving, and moving is then disabled<br>
at the time when the current value becomes equal<br><br>
to the maximum value. Furthermore, allowed move<br>
qount control information may be flags indicating<br>
statuses, for example, indicating (1) move disabled<br>
(2) moving allowed only once (3) moving allowed<br>
infinitely, instead of a counter like the above.<br>
Additionally, though the moving of content<br>
proper is performed at the last step according to<br>
the move processing flow illustrated in FIG. 13,<br>
the moving of the content proper may be performed<br>
at the first step. Even at such an occasion, the<br>
content is subjected to encryption for storage so<br>
that there is no risk of use, moving, and exploitation<br>
in other way without due authorization.<br>
(Embodiment 3)<br>
In Embodiment 3, a content management system<br>
which manages the copying and moving of content is<br>
explained.<br>
As illustrated in FIG. 16, according to this<br>
system, content management apparatus 110 comprises<br>
both copy control section 113 and move control<br>
section 115. Except for that mentioned above, the<br>
configuration is the same as that of Embodiments<br>
1 and 2 (FIG. 2, FIG. 11) . In addition, copy control<br>
section 113 and move control section 115 perform<br><br>
the same functions as, done in Embodiments 1 and 2<br>
respectively.	<br><br>
Next, using a specific example, the 1st<br>
content use model according to this embodiment and<br>
processing of a content management system with such<br>
a model is explained. The 1st content use model is<br>
a model in which copied content has the same allowed<br>
move count as that at the time of distribution. First<br>
of all, it is assumed that content 1601 and additional<br>
information 1602 illustrated in FIG. 17 is stored<br>
securely in content management apparatus 110.<br>
Additional information 1602 associated with content<br>
1601 includes allowed copy count control information<br>
and allowed move count control information, where<br>
the allowed move count control information is made<br>
up of initially allowed move count control<br>
information and currently allowed move count control<br>
information. The initially allowed move count<br>
control information is allowed move count control<br>
information which is set at the time of content<br>
distribution (set initially), and after the<br>
distribution, its value stays constant regardless<br>
of repeated copying and moving. On the other hand,<br>
currently allowed move count control information<br>
is information of which value decreases after the<br>
distribution upon the occurrence of a move, which<br>
is substantially the same as allowed move count<br><br>
control information in Embodiment 2. In the case<br>
of this example, the allowed move count of content<br>
1601 which is set at the time of distribution is<br>
three times, and after going through two times of<br>
move processing, the content is currently stored<br>
in content management apparatus 110.<br>
Next, an explanation is given on a setting<br>
method of initially allowed move count control<br>
information and currently allowed move count control<br>
information at a copy target in a case where<br>
instructions are given by a user for copying content<br>
1601 stored in content management apparatus 110 into<br>
storage medium 120. FIG. 18 is a diagram illustrating<br>
a setting example of the values of allowed copy count<br>
control information after copy processing, and of<br>
initially allowed move count control information<br>
and currently allowed move count control information<br>
after the same in the case of this example. As<br>
illustrated with reference numeral 1701 in FIG. 18,<br>
at the copy origin (content management apparatus),<br>
the values before copying are taken over without<br>
any change as initially allowed move count control<br>
information and currently allowed move count control<br>
information respectively, whereas allowed copy<br>
count control information is decremented by one.<br>
On the other hand, as illustrated with<br>
reference numeral 1702 in FIG. 18, the value before<br><br>
copying is taken over with out any change as initially<br>
allowe move count control information at the copy<br>
target (storage medium), whereas the value of the<br>
initially allowed move count control information<br>
at the copy origin is substituted into the currently<br>
allowed move count control information at the copy<br>
target. In addition, allowed copy count control<br>
information is set to be "0" (a model for disabling<br>
a sub-copy [the 1st content use model in Embodiment<br>
1] ) .<br>
In this way, it is possible to implement a<br>
content use model having the same conditions of<br>
allowed move count of copied content as those at<br>
the time of distribution thereof by substituting<br>
the initially aliowed move count control information,<br>
which is allowed move count set at the time of the<br>
content distribution (set initially), into the<br>
currently allowed move count control information<br>
at the copy target.<br>
It is noted that, though an explanation is<br>
given in FIG. 18 by taking an example of a content<br>
copy model which disables a sub-copy, other than<br>
such a model, this embodiment is also implementable<br>
in the same manner as with such a model by adopting<br>
any of all content copy models described in<br>
Embodiment 1.<br>
In addition, it is also possible to implement<br><br>
another model which takes over a single value without<br>
any change at the time of copying in a case where<br>
allowed move count control information associated<br>
with content is not made up of two of initially<br>
allowed move count control information andcurrently<br>
allowed move count control information, but has only<br>
said single value.<br>
Furthermore, though it is assumed in the<br>
explanation given herein that initially allowed move<br>
count control information and currently allowed move<br>
count control information are counters whose values<br>
decrease at each moving, these may net be such<br>
counters but may be flags indicating statuses, for<br>
example, indicating (1) move disabled (2) moving<br>
allowed only once (3) moving allowed infinitely.<br>
Moreover, in a case where instructions are<br>
given by a user for moving content 1601 stored in<br>
content management apparatus 110 to storage medium<br>
120, it is also possible to implement a model which<br>
takes over the value of allowed copy count control<br>
information at a move source as allowed copy count<br>
control information at a move destination. Moreover,<br>
even in a case where copy generation management<br>
information is associated with content, it is also<br>
implementable in the same way.<br>
Next, the 2nd content use model according to<br>
this embodiment and processing of a content<br><br>
management system with such a model is explained.<br>
The 2nd content use model is a model which realizes<br>
quasi-copying of content from the 1st storage medium<br>
to the 2nd- storage medium.<br>
Reference numeral 1810 in FIG. 19 shows a<br>
conceptual diagram of the 2nd content use model in<br>
this embodiment. In a content use model illustrated<br>
in conceptual diagram 19, it is assumed that content<br>
stored in storage medium 1811 is set with allowed<br>
copy count of "10" and allowed move count of "1."<br>
First of all, in accordance with the 1st content use<br>
model in Embodiment 1 (a model which disables a<br>
sub-copy), this content is processed to be copied<br>
to content management apparatus 1812. Next, the<br>
copied content is processed to be moved to another<br>
storage medium 1813 which is other than storage<br>
medium 1811 in accordance with the 2nd content use<br>
model in Embodiment 2 . Herein, the allowed move count<br>
is not decreased by performing the moving processing<br>
in accordance with the 2nd content use model in<br>
Embodiment 2. Consequently, the allowed copy count<br>
associated with the content stored in storage medium<br>
1813 becomes "0", whereas the allowed move count<br>
therewith becomes "1", and therefore it is possible<br>
to provide the same situation as one where a direct<br>
copy is done from storage medium 1811 to storage<br>
medium 1813 by a model disabling a sub-copy.<br><br>
This means that it is possible to realize the<br>
quasi-copying of content from the 1st storage medium<br>
to the 2nd storage medium even by using, for example,<br>
a content management apparatus having only one slot<br>
for reading /writing a storage medium, just in the<br>
same way as done by a content management apparatus<br>
having two slots which is able to copy content in<br><br>
a storage medium inserted in one slot to another<br>
storage medium inserted in the other slot.<br>
It is noted that, though it is assumed in<br>
conceptual diagram 19 that copy processing is<br>
performed with a model disabling a sub-copy at the<br>
time of copying content from storage medium 1811<br>
to content management apparatus 1812, other than<br>
that model, it is also implementable in the same<br>
manner as with such a model by adopting any of all<br>
content copy models described in Embodiment 1.<br>
In addition, as illustrated with reference<br>
numeral 1820 in FIG. 19, it is possible to realize<br>
the quasi-copying of content from the 1st content<br>
management apparatus 1821 to the 2nd content<br>
management apparatus 1823 while having storage<br>
medium 1822 serve as a bridge by, firstly, performing<br>
copy processing from content management apparatus<br>
1821 to storage medium 1822 in accordance with any<br>
of content copy models described in Embodiment 1,<br>
and next, by performing moving processing of the<br><br>
copied content to content management apparatus 182 3<br>
in accordance with the 3rd content use model in<br>
Embodiment 2 .<br>
As described above, according to a system of<br>
this embodiment, it is possible to implement a<br>
content use model having the same conditions of<br>
allowed move count of copied content as those at<br>
the time of distribution thereof with a content<br>
management apparatus comprising both copy control<br>
section 113 and move control section 115, achieved<br>
by that such an apparatus manages copy-related<br>
control information on and move-related control<br>
information on content and further manages initially<br>
allowed move count control information and currently<br>
allowed move count control information as allowed<br>
move count control information, and by that the value<br>
of the initially allowed move count control<br>
information is substituted into the currently<br>
allowed move count control information at a copy<br>
target at the time of copy processing.<br>
Furthermore, it is possible to realize the<br>
quasi-copying of content from the 1st storage medium<br>
to the 2nd storage medium by performing copy<br>
processing from the 1st storage medium to a content<br>
management apparatus, and by performing the moving<br>
processing of the copied content to the 2nd storage<br>
medium in such a manner that allowed move count is<br><br>
not decreased. Still furthermore, it is possible<br>
to realize the quasi-copying of content from the<br>
1st content management apparatus to the 2nd content<br>
management apparatus by performing copy processing<br>
from the 1st content management apparatus to a storage<br>
medium, and by performing the moving processing of<br>
the copied content to the 2nd content management<br>
apparatus in such a manner that allowed move count<br>
is not decreased.<br>
(Embodiment 4)<br>
In Embodiment 4, an explanation is given on<br>
copy processing and move processing for a case where<br>
use restriction information is associated with<br>
content .<br>
The configuration diagram of this content<br>
management system may be any of configuration<br>
diagrams in Embodiments 1 through 3 (FIG. 2, FIG.<br>
11, and FIG. 16) .<br>
With a specific example, a content use model<br>
according to this embodiment and processing of a<br>
content management system with such a model is<br>
explained below.<br>
First of all, it is assumed that content 1901<br>
and additional information 1902 illustrated in FIG.<br>
20 is stored securely in content management<br>
apparatus 110. The difference herein from the<br><br>
example of content and its additional information<br>
described in Embodiment 1 is that use restriction<br>
information, in addition to allowed copy count<br>
control information, is further associated with<br>
content. Moreover, use restriction information is<br>
made up of current use restriction information,<br>
initial use restriction information, and fixed use<br>
restriction information. In the same manner as in<br>
the relation between currently allowed move count<br>
control information and initially a 1 lowed move count<br>
control information according to Embodiment 3, the<br>
relation between current use restriction<br>
information and initial use restriction information<br>
can be described in such a way that the current use<br>
restriction information varies its use restriction<br>
value as content playback is executed after<br>
distribution, while the initial use restriction<br>
information is use restriction information set at<br>
the time of content distribution.<br>
As a specific example, in FIG. 20, the current<br>
value and the initial value of use restriction<br>
related to allowed playback count are associated<br>
with content. In the case of this example, the allowed<br>
playback count of content 1901 which is set at the<br>
time of distribution is three times, and after going<br>
through one execution of playback processing, the<br>
content is currently stored in content management<br><br>
apparatus 110 in the status of remaining two times<br>
of allowed playback executions.<br><br>
In addition, fixed use restriction<br>
information is use restriction information of which<br>
value does not change even when content is played<br>
back. As a specific example, in FIG. 20, use<br>
restriction related to a threshold is associated<br>
with content. Here, the threshold is information<br>
for decrementing the allowed playback count by one<br>
(regards as one execution of playback) upon the<br>
elapsing of a certain time period specified by said<br>
threshold after starting of content playback. It<br>
is noted that, an allowed playback count and a<br>
threshold is mentioned as an example set of use<br>
restriction information in FIG. 20, however, the<br>
use restriction information may be any other kinds<br>
of information.<br>
Next, an explanation is given regarding a<br>
setting method of use restriction information at<br>
a copy target in a case where instructions are given<br>
by a user for copying content 1901 stored in content<br>
management apparatus 110 into storage medium 120.<br>
FIG. 21 is a diagram illustrating a setting example<br>
of the values of allowed copy count control<br>
information after copy processing, and of use<br>
restriction information according to an example of<br>
this case. As illustrated with reference numeral<br><br>
2001 in FIG. 21, at the copy origin (content<br>
management apparatus), the values before copying<br>
are taken over without any change as three kinds<br>
of use restriction information, whereas allowed copy<br>
count control information is decremented by one.<br>
On the other hand, as illustrated with reference<br>
numeral 2002 in FIG. 21, the values before copying<br>
are taken over without any change as the initial<br>
use restriction information (initially allowed<br>
playback count) and the fixed use restriction<br>
information (fixed threshold) at the copy target<br>
(storage medium), whereas the value of the initial<br>
use restriction information (initially allowed<br>
playback count) at the copy origin is substituted<br>
into the current use restriction information<br>
(currently allowed playback count) at the copy<br>
target. In addition, the allowed copy count control<br>
information is set to be "0" (a model for disabling<br>
a sub-copy [the 1st content use model in Embodiment<br>
13) .<br>
In this way, it is possible to implement a<br>
content use model having the same conditions of use<br>
restriction information of copied content as those<br>
at the time of distribution by substituting the<br>
initial use restriction information, which is use<br>
restriction information set at the time of the<br>
content distribution (set initially), into the<br><br>
current use restriction information at the copy<br>
target, while taking over the values be fore copying<br>
without any change for other use restriction<br>
information.<br>
It is noted that,though an explanation is<br>
given in FIG. 21 by taking an example of a content<br>
copy model which disables a sub-copy, other than<br>
such a model, this embodiment is also implementable<br>
in the same manner as with such a model by adopting<br>
any of all content copy models described in<br>
Embodiment 1.<br>
In addition, it is also possible to implement<br>
another content use model which takes over each value<br>
without any change at the time of copying in a case<br>
where use restriction information associated with<br>
content is not made up of initial use restriction<br>
information, current use restriction information,<br>
and fixed use restriction information, in other<br>
words, in a case where use restriction information<br>
does not have initial use restriction information.<br>
Moreover, in a case where instructions are<br>
given by a user for moving content 1901 stored in<br>
content management apparatus 110 to storage medium<br>
120, it is also possible to implement a content use<br>
model which takes over each value of use restriction<br>
information at a move source as each use restriction<br>
information at a move destination.<br><br>
In addition, in the exampl e o f FIG . 20, though<br>
additiopal information associated with content is<br>
allowed copy count control information and use<br>
restriction information only, copy generation<br>
management information and allowed move count<br>
control information may be associated therewith.<br>
 As described above, according to a system of<br>
this embodiment, it is possible to implement a<br>
content use model having the same conditions of use<br>
restriction information of copied content as those<br>
at the time of distribution thereof, achieved by<br>
that use restriction information on content is<br>
managed, where the use restriction information is<br>
made up of current use restriction information,<br>
initial use restriction information, and fixed use<br>
restriction information, and that the value of the<br>
initial use restriction information is substituted<br>
into the current use restriction information at the<br>
copy target at the time of copy processing.<br>
As made clear from the foregoing descriptions,<br>
according to the present invention, additional<br>
information of content is updated at the time of<br>
the copying and moving of the content, and the<br>
management of the copying and moving of the content<br>
thereafter is done by equipment which handles the<br>
content based on the updated additional information.<br>
For that reason, the necessity for complex<br><br>
management such as check-ins according to the<br>
conventional scheme is dbviated, making it possible<br>
to achieve content management easily understandable<br>
for users .<br>
In addition, it is possibleto implement a<br>
content use model which disables a sub-copy, or a<br>
content use model which manages the aggregate number<br>
o f copies.<br>
Moreover, it is possible to implement a<br>
content use model which regards that one execution<br>
of move processing occurs at a time when a move from<br>
the first storage medium to the second storage medium<br>
is completed with a content management apparatus<br>
functioning as a bridge, or a content use model which<br>
regards that one execution of move processing occurs<br>
at a time when a move from the first content<br>
management apparatus to the second content<br>
management apparatus is completed with a storage<br>
medium functioning as a bridge.<br>
Furthermore, it is possible to implement a<br>
content use model which sets the conditions of<br>
allowed move count of copied content as those at<br>
the time of distribution thereof, a content use model<br>
which does the quasi-copying content from the 1st<br>
storage medium to the 2nd storage medium, or a content<br>
use model which does the quasi-copying content from<br>
the 1st content management apparatus to the 2nd<br><br>
content management apparatus.<br>
In addition, it is possible to implement a<br>
content use model which makes the conditions of use<br>
restriction information of copied content as those<br>
at the time of distribution thereof.<br>
This specification is based on the Japanese<br>
Patent Application No. 2001-206491 filed on July<br>
6, 2001, entire content of which is expressly<br>
incorporated by reference herein.<br>
