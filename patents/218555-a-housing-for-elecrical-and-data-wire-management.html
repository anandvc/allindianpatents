				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a housing for electrical and data<br>
wire management for use in an office panel system.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF PRIOR ART<br>
Present day office furniture are modular in design. Such design<br>
makes use of modular pieces, which are fitted into each other easily,<br>
allowing users to add or take out pieces to fit the office space and working<br>
requirements. Wires for connection of personal computers and other office<br>
equipment would then have to be laid to such equipment through or under<br>
the modular pieces.<br>
There have been office panel systems with spaces for wires to be<br>
laid have been provided. However, such wires for office equipment are<br>
usually pulled through in an unorganized manner. This makes wire<br>
re-laying and re-wiring difficult.<br>
In the construction of offices, data wires, electrical power cables,<br>
computer wires, network cables and printer wires are laid in a haphazard<br>
manner. This is because the workmen responsible for laying of each type<br>
of cable or wire are doing it at different times and for different objective.<br>
As a result, in practice, cables, wires, data lines are laid on top of each<br>
other, the earliest being laid below and the latest being just laid on top of<br>
the bundle of wires/cables. This makes re-laying of a specific or cable very<br>
difficult, the workman having to unravel the messy bundle.<br>
OBJECT  AND SUMMARY  OF THE INVENTION<br>
The  present  invention  was made to solve  the above problems.<br>
Accordingly, a first object of the Invention is to provide a housing for<br>
electrical and data wiring management slidably fitted into a panel rail<br>
with one or more apertures for use in a office panel system, the panel with<br>
a rail on each side, the housing comprising a linear groove on each side;<br>
an aperture for the passage of wires; a recess to receive a fastening<br>
means; a fastening means; a tightening means; and means to connect the<br>
housing to other parts of the office panel system characterised in that the<br>
housing is slidably fitted into the groove of the panel rail, the aperture of the<br>
housing then aligned with the aperture in the panel slide, said housing<br>
being locked into its position vis-a-vis with the slide rail of the office panel<br>
by   the  fastening means,  to allow the passage of electrical wires.<br>
A second object of the invention is to lock the housing in place when<br>
fitted into the panel slide with a fastening means comprising of a fastener<br>
with two resilient shoulders, a tightening means comprising of a tightening<br>
screw which is inserted into a hole at each end of the housing wherein<br>
the fastener is inserted into the recess to receive the fastener, the<br>
shoulder of the fastener facing the panel rail is held in place when the<br>
tightening screw is screwed into the housing, exerting pressure on each<br>
shoulder of the fastener causing the shoulder to push out against the panel<br>
rail  and  the  housing   is then   held  in place.<br>
A third object of the Invention is to further allow the housing to be<br>
connected to other parts of the office panel system with a means to<br>
connect the housing to other parts of the office panel system comprising of<br>
a cable harness rail holder, hinge, hollow tube holder, snap lock for hollow<br>
tube holder, snap look for hinged cover and a hinged cover.<br>

Fig. 7 is a cross section view of the housing from one side<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
Fig. 1 Is a perspective view of the housing 5 with other parts of the<br>
office system. The housing 5 has a cable access aperture 9 (10cm - 20cm)<br>
and a slide groove 10 (22cm- 26cm) on each side. The panel rail has one<br>
or more apertures and a linear slot 3 on each side. The housing is slid into<br>
the linear slot 3 of the panel rail. The aperture of the panel rail is then<br>
aligned with the cable access aperture 9 (10cm - 20cm) of the housing 5<br>
and held in place with fastening and tightening means.<br>
The housing also has means to connect the housing to other parts of<br>
the office panel system comprising of a cable-harness rail holder 15 (lcm<br>
- 3cm), hinge 14, hollow tube holder 19 (10cm-20cm), snap lock for<br>
hollow tube 18 (2cm-4cm), snap lock for hinged cover 20 (2cm-5cm) and<br>
a hinged cover 4 (2cm-5cm).<br>
Fig. 2 is a perspective view of the housing 5 viewed from the back.<br>
A fastening means which is a fastener 11 with two resilient shoulders 16<br>
(2cm-5cm) is inserted into a recess 13 (lcm- 3cm) to receive the fastener<br>
11 before the housing is to be slid into the panel rail.<br>
The housing 5 has a slide groove 10 (2cm-26 cm) on each side,<br>
which slides fittingly into the linear slot 3 of the panel rail. After sliding<br>
into the linear slot of the panel rail, the cable access aperture 9 (10cm-<br>
20cm) of the housing is aligned with the aperture of the panel rail. A<br>
tightening means in the form of a screw 12 (4cm-7cm) is then inserted into<br>
a hole 2 (lcm-3cm) located at the top of the housing and tightened,<br>
exerting pressure on the two resilient shoulders 16 (2cm-5cm) of the<br>
fastener. The two resilient shoulders 16 (2cm-5cm) then expand, pushing<br>
out against the panel rail, holding the housing in its place. A similar<br>
operation is repeated for the second hole located at the bottom of the<br>
housing, This is possible since, as mentioned above the housing 5 has a<br>
slide groove 10 (22cm-26cm) on each side, which slides fittingly into the<br>
linear slot 3 (see Fig. 1) of the panel rail. After sliding into the linear slot<br>
of the panel rail, the cable access aperture 9 of the housing is aligned with<br>
the aperture or the panel rail. A tightening means in the form of screw 12<br>
(4cm-12 cm) is then inserted into a second hole 2 (lcm-3cm) located at the<br>
bottom of the housing and tightened, exerting pressure on the two resilient<br>
shoulders 16 of the fastener. The two resilient shoulders 16 then expand,<br>
pushing out against the panel rail, holding the housing in its place.<br>
The combined effect of the tightening means at the top and bottom<br>
of the housing against the panel rail holds the housing in place, with its<br>
cable access aperture 9(10 cm-20cm) aligned with the aperture of the<br>
panel rail, thus allowing wires to be pulled through. Since the housing and<br>
the panel slide are connected to other pieces of a office panel system,<br>
electrical wires could be pulled through the cable access apertures and<br>
through other hollow spaces within the other pieces of the office panel<br>
system to allow connection to personal computers and other office<br>
equipment.<br>
Fig. 3 is a perspective view of the housing 5 viewed from the front.<br>
The front of the housing is connected to other parts of the office panel<br>
system such as a hollow tube 7 and cable harness rail holder 15 (lcm-3cm)<br>
and also the hinged cover 4 (2-5cm) and locked firmly in place by the<br>
hollow tube 7 and snaplock 20. The hinge cover 4 and snap lock for cover<br>
20 is held in place by the hinge 15 and snap lock for cover 20. This will<br>
allow other pieces of the office panel system and the electrical wires to be<br>
laid through the hollow spaces of pieces of the office panel system and<br>
held in place securely.<br>
Fig. 4 is a cross section of the housing viewed from the back<br>
without the fastening means nor tightening means. The top and bottom of<br>
the housing has a recess 13 (lcm - 3cm) to receive the fastener with its<br>
two resilient shoulders 16. The housing 5 has a slide groove 10 (22-26 cm)<br>
on each side, which slides into the linear slot 3 of the panel rail.<br>
Fig. 5 is a cross section view of the housing 5 from the front. The<br>
cable harness rail holder 16, hollow tube holder 19 (1-3 cm), snap lock for<br>
hollow tube holder 18 (2-4 cm), snap lock for snap lock cover 20 and a<br>
cable access aperture 9 are shown.<br>
Fig. 6 is a cross section view of the housing from the top. A recess<br>
hole 2 for the tightening screw 12 (4 to 7 cm) allows the tightening screw<br>
to be inserted into the housing through the recess hole. A similar hole to<br>
allow a second screw to be inserted into the housing is located at the<br>
bottom of the housing. The tightening screw 12 (4cm-7cm) is only<br>
tightened onto the fastener when the cable access aperture of the housing<br>
and panel rail are aligned. The tightening action of the front portion of the<br>
tightening screw 12 exerts pressure on the shoulder 16 (2-5 cm) of the<br>
fastener. As the shoulder 16 (2cm-5cm) of the fastener is resilient, the<br>
pressure of the screw on the fastener forces the shoulder 16 to push out<br>
against the front of the panel rail. It should be noted that panel rail and<br>
housing are always in a vertical position and unless held in place, the<br>
aperture of the panel rail and the aperture of the housing would tend to be<br>
out of alignment causing the wires to be damaged or out of place.<br>
However, the combined force of each shoulder of the fastener exerted on<br>
the panel rail is sufficient to hold the housing 5 in its place. This is due to<br>
the fact that the panel rail and housing are always in a vertical position.<br>
The housing has a tendency to slide due to force of gravity. The tightening<br>
action of the front portion of the tightening screw 12 exerts pressure on the<br>
shoulder 16 of the fastener. As the shoulder 16 of the fastener is resilient,<br>
the pressure of the screw on the fastener forces the shoulder 16 to push out<br>
against the front of the panel rail. Since the housing is molded out of<br>
plastics, and the panel rails are made of metal, the housing and panel rails<br>
have different coefficient of friction. When the housing and panel rail are<br>
placed together, there is frictional force acting between them.<br>
One advantage of this housing is to allow flexible and systematic<br>
laying of wires within a modular panel office system. This is explained as<br>
follows:<br>
In the construction of offices, data wires, electrical power cables,<br>
computer wires, network cables and printer wires are laid in a haphazard<br>
manner. This is because the workmen responsible for laying of each type<br>
of cable or wire are doing it at different times and for different objective.<br>
As a result, in practice, cables, wires, data lines are laid on top of each<br>
other, the earliest being laid below and the latest being just laid on top of<br>
the bundle of wires/cables. This makes re-laying of a specific or cable very<br>
difficult, the workman having to unravel the messy bundle.<br>
Since with the present invention, there are other accessories such as<br>
"clips" and "hangers" which allow the cables and wires to be lined in an<br>
organized manner (see Fig 1). These "clips" and hangers" (listed as feature<br>
8 of the present invention) are installed on the inside of the office panels<br>
and partitions. The systematic laying comes about when each cable or wire<br>
or data line is hung in a specific clip in the cable harness. This would mean<br>
the data wires and cables are laid neatly and suspended through the cable<br>
harness.<br>
Another advantage is this housing allows easier maintenance of<br>
wires since the wires are all held in place neatly in an organized manner.<br>
It will be understood that the housing described herein is a preferred<br>
embodiment and should not be construed as limiting in its scope of<br>
working.<br>
