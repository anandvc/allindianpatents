Prelude to the Invention:<br>
1.5 Million two wheelers for ten million Chennai metro population is a serious concern for civic authorities and traffic managers. Two-wheelers parking in important commercial centers either cuts into the artery roads reducing the effective width of the road leading to traffic congestion or cuts into pavement causing hurdles to the pedestrians. Handicapped and the aged.<br>
This proposal is for finding a solution for the parking needs by utilizing the hitherto unutilized space overhead.<br>
Description of the Invention:<br>
This invention is to find a solution for two-wheeler parking with least land requirements. Presently for parking 50 two-wheelers 125 sq.mts or 1250 sq/ft. of land is required as per CMDA regulations in important commercial areas, where land is scarce or prohibitively costly. Our proposal requires only 8.5 sq.mts. or 85 sq. ft. thus saving a whooping 1200% of land-space.<br>
According to this invention, a number of Steel/RCC columns are erected along the road / pavement and suitably designed one or more elevators are installed. One or more transfer modules, power arms and carriers are the other components of the system. A computer acts as a central controller, which operates through controllers, limit switches and other gadgets. This central controller bills, controls, operates and monitors all operations in respect of parking/retrieving any selected vehicle into/from any selected slot without hindrance to any other parked vehicles, safely and reliably. The average parking /retrieval time is less than one minute. The system also incorporates manual backup for retrieval in case of extreme contingencies.<br><br>
The following specifications describe and ascertain the nature of this invention and the manner in which this is to be performed:<br>
The present invention relates to the concept and the system as a whole and the specific sequences of operations and the manner in which they are to be performed<br>
The present invention relates to the parldng facility as a whole and the individual components viz. hoisting equipment, transfer module, power arm, platform carriers, controllers, the software and the specific sequences of operations and the manner in which they are to be performed in a fiiUy automatic, muM level fusilogic two-wheeler parking.<br>
According to the present invention, there are provided one or more floors, above ground, below ground or combination of the both, supported on steel /RCC columns, bracings and other structural members. One or more hoisting equipments as input-cum-output device/devices serve these floors. The location of the device is generally along the axis of the parked vehicles, however, not limited to the above, but to other positions to meet the specific needs and space constraints and other conditions and site requirements. One or more transfer modules placed either inside the elevator or on the parking floors. These transfer modules move parallel to the line of parking independently and also simultaneously, if warranted. These transfer modules are with single/dual speed motors with reversible operation option. These transfer modules carry the two wheeler independently inside the parking lot relative to other parked two-wheelers without any hindrance. The operation of these transfer modules is centrally controlled and monitored by a system controller. These transfer modules carry the vehicles to be parked into the designated slots from the elevator or carry the vehicles to be retrieved from the specific slots to the elevator.<br>
A power arm capable of movements perpendicular to the line of parking is provided with single/dual speed motor with reversible operation option.   It is mounted on the transfer<br><br>
module. It picks up the two-wheeler that is positioned on a platform-carrier in the elevator and settles down on the transfer module for onward carriage to the designated slot. On reaching the location, the power arm places the two-wheeler in the parking slot and returns to the transfer module to receive fiirther command. When the two-wheeler is to be retrieved, as soon as the transfer module is stationed at the designated slot as commanded by the central control unit, the power arm picks up the two-wheeler on the platform-carrier and places it on the transfer module for onward carriage to the elevator. The power arm then transfers the vehicle along with the platform-carrier from the transfer module to the elevator.<br>
A platform carrier with or without additional fixtures for securing safely the two-wheeler in position with push-handle and support wheels for easy handling is provided. The whole arrangement is capable of transferring a steering locked two wheeler from the reception area to the designated parking slot within the parking facility without hindrance to any other parked vehicles. In the reverse operation, it is capable of retrieving a selected steering locked two wheeler from the parking slot without hindrance to any other parked vehicles within the facility.<br>
The system is also capable of transferring one parked vehicle from its existing slot to<br>
another vacant slot within the same parking facility, without disturbing other parked<br>
vehicles.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE SYSTEM:<br>
A parking platform (Part No.6, Drg No. 1,2,3) at 6-metre elevation or 2.5 metres depending upon the location whether the road or pavement is erected on suitably designed steel colimms (Part No.7, Drg No.3). An elevator (Part No.l, Drg No. 1,2,3) provided for elevating and lowering two wheelers for parking and retrieval also serves as a supporting column for the super structure. The parking platform (Part No.6, Drg No. 1,2,3) is structurally interlaced to support the parked two wheelers and to facilitate individual two wheeler movement either for parking or for retrieval<br><br>
without any hindrance to the other parked vehicles. The elevator is designed for 2-speed operation that is with load and without load.<br>
One or more transfer modules (a patented item) (Part No3, Drg. No.6,7,&amp;8) are positioned on both sides of the elevators and its function is to transfer the 2 wheelers from the elevator to the designated slot or vice-versa.<br>
A carefully designed (a patented item) power arm (Part No.4, Drg, No.5&amp;7) places the two-wheeler from the transfer module into the slot for parking- It also carries the two-wheeler from the slot (Part No.lO, Drg. No.2&amp;3) and places in the transfer module for retrieval.<br>
A computer functions as a central controller and it directs, controls and monitors the entire parking and retrieval operations.<br>
Well laid out limit switches, controllers and interlocks as a whole executes safe, reliable parking and retrieving operations.<br>
A fully manual standby (Part No. 12, Drg. No.l) arrangement is provided to retrieve<br>
the parked vehicles in the event of extraordinary contingency.<br>
The parking platform is provided with adequate cladding and sheeting (Part No.8,<br>
Drg. No.l&amp;2) to ensure dust free, rain free, sun free, pilferage free and theft free<br>
parking.<br>
The operation of the system is described below:<br>
As a two wheeler reports at the reception, the system controller (Part No 9, Drg.No 9 &amp; 10) acknowledges receipt of the vehicle, checks availability of the slot (Part No 10, Drg.No 2) and allots a slot in the specific wing (in case of multi-level parking, also the specific floor). The vehicle is parked on the platform carrier (Part No 5 Drg.No 4) and locked. The platform carrier (Part No 5 Drg.No 4) is with moving wheels and is either manually pushed into the elevator or received by a power arm (Part No 2 Drg.No 1) in<br><br>
the Elevator (Part No 1, Drg.No 1&amp;2 )The elevator rises to the Parking floor(Part No 12, Drg.No 1&amp;3). The system controller (Part No 9 Drg.No 9&amp;10) commands either the left wing or the right-wing transfer module (Part No 3 Drg.No 6) to get ready to receive the vehicle from the elevator. The power arm (Part No 4 Drg.No 5&amp;7) on the transfer module waiting at transit station picks up the vehicle along with the platform carrier (Part No 5 Drg.No 4&amp;7) from the elevator (Part No 1 Drg.No 1,2,3) and settles in its place on transfer module. The transfer module moves along the track (Part No 11 Drg.No 8) and stops near any one of the parking slots. (Part No 10 Drg.No 1) as commanded by the system controller (Part No 9 Drg.No 9,10). The power arm (Part No 4 Drg.No 5&amp;7) in the transfer module (Part No 3 Drg.No 6&amp;7) places the two-wheeler into the slot and returns to its normal position. The whole thing is presented by a drawing (Drg. No 9) for clarity.<br>
Similarly, when a request for retrieval of a particular vehicle is received, the system controller (Part No 9 Drg.No 9,10) verifies, bills and authorizes its retrieval. The system controller simultaneously issues command to the elevator (Part No 1 Drg.No 1,2,3) and the respective transfer module (Part No 3 Drg.No 6,7&amp;8). The elevator rises to the parking floor (Part No 6 Drg.No 3). The transfer module moves to the designated slot. The power arm (Part No 4 Drg.No 5&amp;7) picks up the specified vehicle and returns to be transfer module. The transfer module (Part No 4 Drg.No 6,7&amp;8) moves along the track (Part No 11 Drg.No 8) to the transit station. The power arm in the transfer module places the two-wheeler into the elevator. The elevator descends to the reception area and the two-wheeler is delivered to the customer. The whole operation is presented by a drawing (Drg.No. 10) for clarity.<br><br><br><br><br>
