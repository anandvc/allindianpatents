A fourth adder (132) recdves, at a firet input, the output of the fourth shifter (130), and a first output storage element (134) receives the output of the fourth adder: (132). The out of the first output storage element (134) is applied to a second input of the fourth adder (132).<br>
[1013] A fourth multiplexer (136) receives the outputs of the first input storage element (122) and the fourth output (P04) of the register file, and a second input storage element (138) receives the output of the fourth multiplexer (136).

The output of the fifth adder (146) is also fed back to the third input (PI3) of the register file. the multiplexers are externally controlled.<br>
[1014] The present invention, in its broadest embodiment, does not require all of the above components, Indeed, it is sufficient that the electronic drcuit merely include a register file (100) including at least one input and at least four outputs<br><br>
(P02-P05); that the electronic circuit further include first (104), second (106), third (128), and fourth (142) multipliers, each having at least two inputs; that it also indude first (118), second (120), third (132), and fourth (146) adders, each adder having, as a first input, an output of the corresponding multiplier (note that these first through fourth adders are the second through fifth adders of the more detailed device); and that the electronic circuit also include means (124), (126), (136), (140) for associating the outputs of the register file with the inputs of at least some of the multipliers, and means (112), (116), (150) for associating another input of at least some of the adders with an output of another multiplier, or with an output of the register file. It is this feature which causes the multipliers, adders, and register file to operate, together, in a single dock cycle.<br>
[1015]      Preferably, the number of register file outputs to the multipliers is four.<br>
[1016] It is also preferred that the electronic circuit further indude at least one input storage element (128), (138). The input of the input storage element is connected to an output (P03) of the register file or to an output of another input storage element (122). The output of the input storage element is connected to an input of at least one of the multliers (128), (142) or to an input of another input storage element (138). The multipliers/ adders, input storage elements, and register file operate, together, in a single dock cycle.<br>
[1017] While the invention will work with only a single input storage element, it is preferred that there be a plurality of input storage elements (122), (138).<br>
[1018] The electronic circuit further preferably indudes at least one output storage element (134), (148), connected to an output of at least one of the adders (132), (146). The multipliers, adders, output storage elements, and register file operate, together, in a single dock cyde.<br>
[1019] It is preferred that the output storage element or elements (134), (148) be external to the register file (100).<br>
[1020] FIG. 1 is, as noted above, a block diagram of the new architecture. The core architecture contains a coupled dual-MAC structure composed of MAC units<br><br>
MACl and MAC2. MACl fetches its multiplier operands from output ports P02 and P03 of the register file The output of the multiplier (104) is passed to a shifter (108) that can shift the result left by 0,1, 2, or 3 bits. The output of the shifter (108) is passed to an adder (114) that takes its other input from a multiplexer, MUXl (116), that has zero and the result of the shifted product from MAC2 as its inputs. The output of the adder (114) is passed into a 40-bit adder (118) than can add another 40-bit operand fetched from output port PO1 of the register file. The output of the 40-bit adder is stored into the register file via input port P11. MAC2 fetches multiplier operands from register file output ports PCM and P05, multiplies them (106), and shifte (110) the result left by 0,1,2, or 3 bits. The shifter output is passed to a 40-bit adder (120) that can add an additional register file operand fetched from output port F06. The shifter output is also sent to the multiplexer, MUXl (116) that feeds the first adder (114) in MACl. The output of the 40-bit adder (120) is stored into the register file via register file input port P12.<br>
[1021] The coprocessor consists of multiply accumulate units MACS and MAC4 that have been connected to the core dual-MAC structure and the register file in a unique way. The inputs to MACS and MAC4 can be configured (via multiplexers MUX2 (124), MUX3 (126), and MUX5 (140)) to be taken from register file output ports P02, P03, P04, P05, or the delay line composed of 16-bit registers Bl (122) and IS2 (138). The output of the shifted product iiv MACS can be fed into MAC4 via MUX6 (150). Alternatively, the 40-bit adders in MACS and MAC4 can take an input from their local )-bit accumulator registers OSl (134) and OS2 (148), respectively. The output of MAC4 can be written to the register file via input port P13. The programmer can set up the multiplexers in the diagram to any desired configuration. by executing certain program instructions, which allows the 4 MAC units to be flexibly configured to speed up several different types of computations. Several of these configurable modes are described below.<br><br>
[10221 FIG. 2 shows the first configuration of the invention, in FIR Filter and Correlation Mode. It can be used to speed up FIR filters and correlation operations. To see why this configuration speeds up FIR filtering, we examine the equation for implementing an FIR filter:<br>
N-l<br>
If we write out the equations for four consecutive outputs, we have<br>
y(n)	=	h(0)x(n) + h(l)x(n-l) + h(2)x(n-2) + ... + h(N-l)x(n-N+l)<br>
y(n+X)	=	h(0)x(n+i) + h(l)x(n) + h(2)x(n-l) +... + hCN-l)x(n-N+2)<br>
y(n+2)	=	h(0)x(n+2) + h(l)x(n+l) + h(2)x{n) + ... + h(N-l)x(n-N+3)<br>
y(n+3)	=	h(0)x(n+3) + h(l)x(n+2) + h(2)xCn+l) +... + h(N-l)x(n-N+4)<br>
To compute these four quantities simultaneously, the same coefficient h(k) is fed to all four multipliers simultaneously, while the other input is fed through a delay line to each of the multipliers. This is shown in the logical implementation diagram shown in FIG. 3.<br>
[1023] FIG. 3 is a logical diagram of the FIR Filter and Correlation Acceleration Mode. To achieve this configuration using the hardware setup shown in FIG. 2, the programmer must execute the proper instructions for the 2 core MACs to insure correct operation. The same register fetched from register file output port P02, and used as an input to each of the coprocessor MAC units, must also be fetched from output port F04. The programme must also insure that the register fetched out of P05 is delayed by one cyde (152) using a parallel register move before being sent out on P03 and propagated through the hardware delay line composed of registers Bl (122) and IS2 (138). The two core MACs perform accumulation by fetching and storing results to the register file (100), while the coprocessor MACs perform accumulation using their local OSl (134) and OS2 (148) accumulators. This configuration can also be used to speed up correlation operations in a similar manner.<br><br>
110241 FIG. 4 shows another configuration, the Single-Cycle Complex Multiply Mode. To speed up FFTs and CDMA symbol demodulation, the coprocessor can also be configured to perfonn single-cycle complex multiplies. As the inputs to each of the core MAC units are sent to the coprocessor to perfonn the cross-term multiplies, the outputs of the core MAC units are added together and sent to the register file (100) via input port P11, while the outputs of the coprocessor MAC units are added together and stored into the register file (100) via input port PIS.<br>
[1025] FIG. 5 shows yet another configuration, the Single-Cycle Complex Multiply-Accumulate Mode. The complex multiply-accumulate configuration is useful for speeding up DFTs and accumulations of 32 x 32 multiplies. As shown in FIG. 5, the multiplier input connections are set up like the single-cyde complex multiply, but the accumulations are set up like the FIR filter acceleration mode. In the 32x32 MAC case, the core MACs are performing signed-signed and unsigned-unrsigned multiplies, while the coprocessor MACs are performing signed-unsigned multiplies.<br>
[1026] The use of 40-bit adders and 17x17 bit multipliers is shown. This is conventional, but any convenient number of bits may be used.<br>
V<br>
