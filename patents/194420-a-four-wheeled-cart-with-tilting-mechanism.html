				<td>The present invention relates to a four wheeled cart with tilting mechanism<br>
The mode of transport in rural India, which comprises 70% of the Indian population, has been based on the draught power. Bullocks shoulder the burden of transporting millions of Indians residing in the rural areas from one place to another. The ubiquitous bullock cart is not only a transport vehicle but finds use in almost every sphere of rural life However, the bullock cart has not received the attention due to it Innovations have however, kept innovating and altering the design by adding multiple use features to it in order to make the cart more efficient But there has been no cart with tilting mechanism so far as the applicant is aware of.<br>
The bullock carts are as such known in the prior art One of such cart comprises a main axle for supporting the chassis/ body of the cart Pair of wheels is provided to support said axle thereon. A yoke is provided at the front end of the chassis for engaging the bullocks to carry the cart from one place to the other The main disadvantage of this cart is that it causes injury to the upper portion of the neck of the bullocks as discussed herein after Another disadvantage is that it can not be tilted as and when required for unloading the material from the body of the cart<br>
The objectives as laid out aforesaid have been met by the present invention.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a four wheeled cart with tilting mechanism comprising<br>
a main chassis supported on a front wheel axle and a rear wheel axle, pairs of wheels being<br>
mounted on said axles,<br>
a cart body tiltably attached to the main chassis for carrying goods thereon,<br>
a tilting mechanism comprising a gear box with a handle for tilting the cart from a normal position<br>

In a preferred embodiment, the tilting lock is attached to a lever for holding the cart body when the tilting mechanism is not in operation, said tilting lock being unlocked on pushing of said lever so that the cart body is free to tilt. A body stand is attached to said frame.<br>
The present invention provides a tilting mechanism which<br>
is an improvement and innovation for the cart. The tilting<br>
mechanism provides the cart with an added feature of<br>
-4-<br><br>
performing agriculture support activities more efficiently in addition to being a means of transport. This feature provides the new cart the potential to create a niche for itself in the urban markets also.<br>
The new cart has several benefits, the most important being the tilting mechanism, which makes the cart an effective dumping and unloading vehicle; and reduces manpower cost for carrying out these activities. The cart also reduces the load on the bullock, thereby effectively increasing its carrying capacity by 50%. The present invention also helps in reducing the problem of gall witnessed in the bullocks pulling the traditional cart.<br>
The cart with its tilting mechanism will not only be useful to the rural folk but may have applications in the more urban areas for municipalities and building activities where mechanized equipments prove either costly or are not available.<br>
Its advantages are: It is a multi featured and long lasting bullock cart; It can provide an economical alternative for small and marginal farmers for efficient operation;<br>
It is a humanitarian cart that saves bullocks from excessive load and pressure.<br>
Draught power and the carts are integral part of all agriculture operations in India. In the dry regions of Saurashtra, farmers use bullock carts to ferry farmyard manure to the fields. The manure is then spread in the<br>
-5-<br><br>
furrows instead of spreading it in the entire field. The operation reduces the manure consumption without decreasing the expected yield of the crop.<br>
The modus operandi is simple but tedious. Farmers download the manure in one corner of the field and manual labour is used for applying the manure in the furrows. The work normally is done during the month of June when the sunrays beat down mercilessly and the heat is unbearable. The present invention end devours to reduce this problem. The tilting feature in the cart is not based on the hydraulic system but is a mechanical modification.<br>
The tilting cart of the present invention is found to be very effective and can successfully solve the problem of applying manure in the furrows without using manual labour.<br>
The main components of the cart of the present invention include four wheels with axles, iron body, gear box, brake system, chassis, shock absorbers. The main body of the cart ('kathedo') has preferably a size of 2.28 X 1.07 X 0.42 meter with load capacity of carriage 1500 kg. The cart can of course be of different types to cater to the needs of various farmer categories.<br>
One type of the cart has a carrying capacity of 1.5 MT. The cart is 4.85 meter in length and has a width of 1.07 meters. The height of the cart is 1.14 meter from the ground level. This cart is of very high quality.<br>
-6-<br><br>
This invention also produces a two-wheeled cart which is designed to cater to the demand of small of small farmers who cannot purchase the expensive four wheel carts.<br>
The cart of the present invention has a distinct advantage over the conventional cart due to the innovative attachment, improved efficiency, and reduced drudgery. The main features that make this cart much more useful to the farmers than the ordinary bullock cart are as follows: <br>
Innovative features of the cart having a tilting mechanism -<br>
The cart has a unique tilting mechanism. The tilting mechanism in the cart helps its function of transporting material, grains, soil, manure, fertilizer etc. The tilting mechanism makes the cart more appealing, as it becomes a multi-purpose vehicle. Secondly, the tilting mechanism provides the cart with an advantage for application in new areas The municipalities and builders both look for vehicles with tilting mechanism to reduce human intervention and so, they may find this cart to their liking for specific needs.<br>
The tilting mechanism operates through a simple system of levers and therefore while having all the benefits associated with the facility of the conventional cart, it costs much less than traditional transport systems with tilting mechanism designed on the hydraulic system.<br>
-7- <br>
Four wheels base:<br>
The conventional bullock cart is two wheeled and normally has wooden wheels. As a result the weight of the cart has to be balanced by the draught animal. While carrying material, this design reduces the capacity of the animal to carry weight considerably. The bullock cart of the present invention mounted on a four-wheeled base can balance on its own. When the cart is being loaded, the weight spreads and there is minimum stress on the bullock. This enhances the capacity of the animal considerably as his energy is mostly being utilized for pulling the cart. The four-wheeled mechanism also makes the cart a more stable and safer system of material transport. Small Turning Radius:<br>
The bullock cart of the present invention has a small turning radius. This helps in executing sharp turns easily. The smaller turning radius makes it a highly maneuverable cart, thereby increasing its efficiency and performance while operating in congested areas. This feature may allow the cart to be used in semi-urban areas for local material transport. Brake system:<br>
The cart of the present invention has a brake system in place. The brakes may be applied to the cart, thereby reducing the tension on the shoulders of the bullock. This feature adds on another advantage compared to the conventional cart, as it is easier to control the cart in<br>
-8-<br><br>
areas with gradients and also while using it in semi-urban and urban areas. This feature is not available in any other cart built in the conventional mode. Pneumatic tyre:<br>
The pneumatic tyres in the cart of the present invention make it easier to pull the cart. Durability:<br>
This cart is much more durable than the conventional bullock cart. Due to its iron body the cart would last for a lifetime while a wood based bullock cart lasts not more than 10 to 12 years. Better load Capacity:<br>
The cart of the present invention has a capacity of 1500 Kg. which is 1.5 times of the conventional cart. The conventional cart cannot regularly perform at hundred percent capacity and may have increased breakdowns. The cart of the present invention, because of the improved design and strong body, can perform at 100% capacity regularly. Due to design advantage, the bullocks also do not find it difficult to pull the cart. Ease of operation:<br>
The cart of this invention is a very user-friendly cart and both the tilting mechanism and brake are designed in such a manner that the driver may use both of them without much difficulty at the same time.<br>
-9-<br><br>
Alternative uses:<br>
The cart of the present invention can perform functions that a conventional cart could not. Due to the additional new features in the cart, the cart of this invention can be useful in the industry and urban areas where cart was never used in the past. One possible application may be in industries, such as paper industry, which require haulage and unloading facility at short distances. Most of the industries use old trucks for bamboo haulage and that costs quite a lot. The cart with its tilting mechanism may be of help to complement this operation being carried out by the trucks. Similar other applications may be explored. Eco-friendly:<br>
The cart of the present inventipn reduces the load on the bullocks and hence makes the life of the animal easier. The cart may be promoted as an Eco-friendly cart. Advantages of the cart of the present invention:<br>
Because of the four wheels, the load of the cart does not rest on the neck of the bullock. This reduces the load on the draught animal and increases its capacity by one and half times.<br>
The reduction of pressure also reduces the likelihood of yoke gall formation on the necks of bullocks.<br>
The tilting mechanism reduces associated cost of unloading and spreading of farm produce, fertilizer, or manure.<br>
-10-<br><br>
Tilting mechanism is sturdy and requires little maintenance.<br>
With the main body and the cart muzzle connected flexibly, the cart has very small turning radius despite its large size. This feature provides high maneuverability to the cart.<br>
It has in-built break systems and shock absorbers which helps on slap and uneven roads.<br>
An effective, efficient low price, detachable body.<br>
Expected life of 25 years or more.<br>

-11-<br><br>
Figs. 8 and 8A show the brake mechanism of the cart of the present invention in the normal position and during action; Fig. 9 shows diagrammatically the advantage of the present invention in preventing yoke gall formation.<br>
The cart of the present invention has a main chassis G which supports all the parts of the cart constituting the cart body V. Bottom members A provide a horizontal support to a base D of the cart. The bottom members may consist of iron plates. Side members B extend from the base D forming the bottom side. Frames C join the upper ends of side members B to keep the base and sides of the cart joined to each other. This frame C also gives structural support to the cart. Side walls E are provided between the bottom members A, side members B and frames C. They may be made of iron strips. Bottom main supports F comprise a pair of iron beams that support the cart base D on the chassis and increase the load carrying capacity pf the cart. The support F also supports the entire upper body of the cart and links it with the chassis G. The chassis G is made of strong iron bars and acts as a nucleus of the cart and supports the cart body V. All the components of the cart are attached directly or indirectly to the main chassis G.<br>
The cart has a four wheel base. This reduces the load on the neck of the draught animal such as a bullock by evenly distributing pressure on the front and rear wheels, thereby preventing yoke gall formation on the neck of the draught animal. The front wheels H are preferably 5.20-14, ISI<br>
-12-<br><br>
standard. Rear wheels are preferably of 500-19, 700-19 ISI standard or 600-19 ISI standard, depending on the desired load bearing capacity of the cart.<br>
The front wheels H are mounted on a front wheel axle I, and shock absorbers N are fitted on the axle I, between the chassis G and axle I. The axle I is connected to the chassis G by means of a front wheel axle stand J. Stand J provides front support to the main chassis G on the front wheels H. The rear wheels H are mounted on a rear wheel axle K. A rear wheel axle stand L connects the rear wheel axle K to the chassis G to provide a rear support for the main chassis G on the rear wheels H. Shock absorbers N can be provided on the rear wheel axle K also.<br>
A wheel brake mechanism M is connected to the wheels. This mechanism helps in checking the speed of the cart, and is very useful on roads with steep gradients.<br>
A stand (0) for front wheel turning is provided for aiding in swift sharp turns of the cart. It comprises a C-shaped iron stand attached to the front wheel axle I.<br>
A tilting mechanism is provided for tilting the cart efficiently with use of very little energy. This mechanism has a gear box p which can also be used as a driver's seat.<br>
From Fig. 4, it can be seen that the gear box P has a handle P1 which is a simple rotating device for triggering the tilting mechanism. A chain P2 is attached to handle P1 and to a small sprocket wheel P3. When the handle is rotated, the chain rotates, thereby rotating the small<br>
-13-<br><br>
sprocket wheel. The small sprocket wheel P3 in turn rotates a large sprocket wheel P4. The large sprocket wheel P4 forces a rod P5 to rotate. Depending on the direction of rotation of handle P1, the rod P5 causes at least one iron rope P6 attached to it to wind or unwind. One end of the rope P6 is attached to the rod P5 and the other end of the rope is attached to the base of the cart body V. Depending on the direction of rotation of the handle P1, the rope P6 either winds on the rod P5 or is unwound from the rod P5. Thus, the cart can be tilted or folded. The rope P6 passes over a pulley P7a mounted on the main chassis G and is attached to the base of the cart body V at P8b so that the rope can move smoothly while folding or tilting the cart.<br>
A cart connector Q, which is an iron pipe, connects the cart to a yoke R. The yoke has a smooth surface. A body stand S of iron pipe is provided on the frame C. When the height of the loaded goods is above the cart body V, to secure loads on the cart, a rope can be tied up with the body stand.<br>
A tilt lock T (Fig. 1) is attached to a lever Tl (Fig.2)<br>
by means of screws. The lock T holds onto the cart body<br>
while the tilting mechanism is not in use. When the driver pushes lever Tl, it pushes the lock put of its position, so that the cart body V is free from the base.<br>
The tilting mechanism of the present invention is operated mechanically and does not require any hydraulic power for its operation. Tilting of the cart is used for<br>
-14-<br><br>
various functions such as spreading manure in the fields, or for dumping soil or other material. This mechanism makes the cart a multi-purpose vehicle.<br>
The operation of the tiltinq mechanism is as follows:<br>
1.	To tilt the cart, the driver unlocks the tilting lock by pressing the lever Tl (Fig. 2). Fig. 3 shows the tilting lock holding onto the cart body V when the tilting mechanism is not in use. Fig. 3A shows the tilting lock unlocked on movement of the lever so that the cart body V is free from the cart base and is tiltable.<br>
2.	To tilt the cart, the handle P1 is moved (Fig. 4). On movement of the handle P1, chain P2 attached to small sprocket wheel P3 rotates and thereby the larger sprocket wheel P4 is rotated. This, in turn, causes the rod P5 to rotate.<br>
In the preferred embodiment of Fig. 4, the rod P5 has preferably two iron ropes P6a, P6b with their one ends attached to thereon and wound thereon in opposite directions. The other ends of the ropes are attached in midsection P8a<br>
and at the base P8b of the cart body over pulleys P7 and P7a.<br>
When the handle is rotated in a first direction, say clockwise direction, the cart is tilled. When the handle is rotated in the opposite direction, say anticlockwise direction, the cart is folded.<br>
The movement of the handle in the clockwise direction leads to the winding of the rope P6b connected to the base P8b of the cart, while the other rope P6a attached to the<br>
-15-<br><br>
mid-section P8a of the cart unwinds. Thus, the body of the cart is tilted. The handle of the gearbox P can also control<br>
the angle of tilt of the cart. For obtaining a larger angle of tilt, the handle can be rotated. The maximum tilt of the cart should preferably be 60°. The tilt of the cart can be in the range of 45 to 60° (Fig. 7). The cart can be positioned at any of the intermediate angles with the help of the gears. The angle of tilt can be controlled by the handle of the gear box.<br>
For bringing the cart into its normal position for loading or movement of the cart, the handle P1 is rotated in the opposite direction (anticlockwise direction). As a result, the rod P5 rotates in the opposite direction to unwind the rope P6b and to wind the rope P6a. Due to this, the cart body touches the base. The lever Tl (Fig. 2) is<br>
then pushed back to the normal position so that the tilting<br>
lock (T) (Fig. 1) is in the locked position.<br>
A flexible connector 01 (Fig. 6) is preferably provided<br>
between the yoke R and the cart body. In the known carts, no<br>
such flexible connector is provided. In the absence of such<br>
flexible connectipn, the angle of turn in the conventional<br>
cart depends on the angle at which the bullock turns. This<br>
angle is very small, and is about 10 to 15° as shown in<br>
Fig. 5. As a result, the conventional cart requires a large<br>
turning area, and it is difficult to turn the cart in a small<br>
space. Since the connector is not flexible, the bullock may<br>
get injured while turning. In contrast, the cart of the<br>
-16-<br><br>
present invention is provided with a flexible connector 01 between the body of the cart and the yoke as can be seem from Fig. 6. As a result, the cart has a turning radius of 100 to 120° .<br>
A conventional cart does not have any brakes. So, the bullock has to not only pull the cart, but also stop it when needed. As a result, the cart driver has to control the bullock. When trying to stop the cart or to reduce the momentum of the cart, the bullock is often injured. In the cart of the present invention, a brake M (Fig. 1) is installed.<br>
From Fig. 8, it can be seen that the brake has a brake lever Ml. Lever Ml is connected to a lever brake connector M2 connected to brake drums on the wheels. Fig. 8 shows the brake in neutral position. When the lever Ml is pushed, the connector M2 pushes the brake drums M3 on the wheels to jam the wheels (Fig. 8A). As a result, the speed of the cart is reduced, thereby bringing the cart to immediate halt.<br>
The yoke gall is a tumor noticed on the neck of the bullock (Fig. 9) caused due to excessive pressure on the shoulders and the neck while pulling and simultaneously balancing the weight on the cart and due to continuous rubbing of the yoke. The pressure and the rubbing cause abrasion in the neck of the bullock. Slowly the abrasion turns into a wound, which turns into a gall. The galls disappear when treated, but come back once the bullock is reemployed to pull the cart. The gall reduces the efficiency<br>
-17-<br><br>
of the draught animal and causes immense pain at the time of pulling the cart.<br>
In the four-wheel cart, the pressure is distributed evenly on the front and rear wheels. The bullock is required only to pull the cart and need not shoulder the weight on the cart while pulling. The reduction in pressure, as depicted in Figure 9, not only reduces pressure on the neck of the bullock but also reduces the tension in the yoke, thereby reducing or effectively nullifying the chances of emergence of the yoke gall. <br>
Description of the operation of the cart:<br>
1.	The yoke is put on the shoulders of the bullock.<br>
2.	The driver sits on the gear box and drives the bullock.<br>
3.	When the cart is required to be tilted, the handle on the gear box is turned towards the right. This causes the chain inside the gear box to move the small sprocket wheel, which in turn moves the big sprocket wheel. This turns the iron rod that turns the rope wound around it. This rope is connected by a pulley on the main chassis to the base of the cart. As the rope is pulled, the cart tilts.<br>
4.	To bring the cart to its original horizontal position, the handle on the gear box is turned towards the left. As the connecting rope slackens, the tilted cart will go back to its original position.<br>
5.	The cart tilts according to how much and how fast the handle is being turned.<br>
