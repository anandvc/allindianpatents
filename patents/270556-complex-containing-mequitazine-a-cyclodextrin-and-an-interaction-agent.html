				<td>TITLE: A COMPLEX COMPRISING MEQUITAZINE, A CYCLODEXTRIN, AND<br>
AN INTERACTION AGENT<br>
The present invention relates to complexes of mequitazine,<br>
cyclodextrins, and an interaction agent, as such complexes<br>
have much higher solubility compared to mequitazine considered<br>
alone.<br>
Numerous pharmaceutically active substances present low<br>
solubility in aqueous media and consequently in biological<br>
media. Such solubility leads to low bioavailability and as a<br>
result doses administered must be increased. Such an increase<br>
is not always without consequences both with respect to side<br>
effects as well as from an economic point of view when<br>
considering the high cost of the pharmaceutically active<br>
ingredients.<br>
Mequitazine is an antihistamine used for the treatment of<br>
allergies. The mequitazine molecule was specifically described<br>
in patent FR 2 034 605.<br>
Mequitazine is generally administered by oral route in a<br>
variety of forms such as syrup, tablets, or gel caps, for<br>
example.<br>
As for many pharmaceutically active ingredients, the<br>
absorption of mequitazine administered by oral route takes<br>
place in the intestine. However, it has been observed by the<br>
applicant that the bioavailability of this active ingredient<br>
is very low, on the order of 0.3%, which could be explained by<br>
its low solubility. A very small portion of the mequitazine<br>
ingested is in solubilized form, and thus it is absorbed with<br>
difficulty through the intestinal barrier.<br>
There are various pharmaceutical publications and patents<br>
relating to the production of interaction complexes of active<br>
ingredients with cyclodextrins, and this with the aim of<br>
improving their solubility. However, none specifically relates<br>
to mequitazine in the form of a racemic mixture or of one of<br>
its enantiomers.<br>
Patent FR 2 742 053 describes an aqueous formulation intended<br>
for the local treatment of ocular allergies. The patent also<br>
describes a collyrium that includes mequitazine and<br>
cyclodextrins in an aqueous solution. As indicated in an<br>
example in the patent, the pH of the ready-to-use collyrium<br>
described therein is adjusted to 6, a value that enables it<br>
alone to ensure complete dissolution of mequitazine. Moreover,<br>
mequitazine and cyclodextrin are simply mixed in the aqueous<br>
medium and by no means is a complex created. Moreover, no<br>
interaction agent is used. The collyrium described in the<br>
patent is neither intended for oral administration nor to be<br>
subjected to a change in pH. Lastly, no allusion is made as to<br>
the bioavailability of mequitazine. Indeed, in the<br>
aforementioned document this problem does not arise because it<br>
involves local application to the eye and not administration<br>
orally.<br>
Thus it should be noted that there is a need with regard to a<br>
pharmaceutical formulation containing mequitazine as an active<br>
ingredient which overcomes the low bioavailability of the<br>
current formulations which result from the low solubility of<br>
mequitazine when administered orally.<br>
With regard to the simple manufacture of a medicine such as a<br>
syrup, solubility is not an obstacle to the formulation of<br>
mequitazine because mequitazine presents high solubility in an<br>
acid pH range from 2 to 6. Thus, for a liquid formulation such<br>
as described in FR 2 742 053, it is sufficient to be placed in<br>
an acid pH range to ensure complete mequitazine solubility. On<br>
the other hand, as neutrality is approached then surpassed,<br>
solubility breaks down, and it is in this case that the<br>
difficulties related to solubility and bioavailability arise<br>
since, as stated above, the pH of the intestinal juce is in an<br>
approximate range of 7 to 9.<br>
The aim of the present invention thus consists of providing a<br>
solid form of mequitazine that presents a satisfactory<br>
solubility in an extended pH range, in particular at basic pH.<br>
Thus, in the cases measured here, solubility is most often<br>
measured at a pH of approximately 9.<br>
The present invention thus has as an aim a complex that<br>
includes mequitazine, a cyclodextrin, and an interaction agent<br>
wherein the rate of solubilization in water of complexed<br>
mequitazine measured for a 2 g/1 mixture of mequitazine in<br>
water at 35 °C after 15 minutes of stirring, is greater than<br>
50% at pH 9.<br>
The mequitazine/cyclodextrin/interaction agent complex<br>
according to the present invention is in solid form.<br>
The mequitazine contained in the complexes according to the<br>
present invention can be presented in racemic form or<br>
enantiomer form, namely L-mequitazine or D-mequitazine. The<br>
present invention thus relates to complexes of a cyclodextrin<br>
and racemic mequitazine, complexes of a cyclodextrin and Dmequitazine,<br>
and/or complexes of a cyclodextrin and Lmequitazine,<br>
all of these complexes including moreover an<br>
interaction agent.<br>
Additionally, it has been noted that when the complexes<br>
involve one mequitazine enantiomer only, either D- or L-, the<br>
rate of solubilization in water of complexed mequitazine<br>
according to the present invention is advantageously greater<br>
than 60% at pH 9, more advantageously greater than 70% at pH<br>
9.<br>
Moreover, it has been noted that when the complexes involve<br>
the L- enantiomer only, the rate of solubilization in water of<br>
the complexed mequitazine according to the present invention<br>
is advantageously greater than 80% at pH 9.<br>
Such complexes make it possible to propose and formulate<br>
mequitazine in soluble form, therefore easily assimilable,<br>
across the physiological pH range and in particular at a pH of<br>
approximately 7 to 10 and more advantageously of approximately<br>
8 to 9. Indeed, as previously indicated, the pH of the<br>
intestinal milieu ranges between approximately 7 and<br>
approximately 9, and it is precisely there that mequitazine is<br>
absorbed. The fact of ensuring a particularly increased<br>
solubility at these pH is an undeniable advantage of the<br>
present invention. As an indication, measured under the same<br>
conditions, the rate of solubilization of mequitazine alone,<br>
which is to say not complexed, is about 1%. Thus, the present<br>
invention makes it possible to increase the solubility of this<br>
molecule by a factor of at least 30, even 60, and even 80.<br>
Thus, the addition of an interaction agent to the<br>
mequitazine/cyclodextrin complex according to the present<br>
invention makes it possible to increase the solubilization of<br>
mequitazine.<br>
In the sense of the present invention, "interaction agent"<br>
means any organic or mineral agent that improves the<br>
physicochemical properties, in particular the properties of<br>
solubilization in aqueous media, of the<br>
mequitazine/cyclodextrin complex by noncovalent interactions<br>
with the mequitazine included in the cyclodextrin or directly<br>
with the mequitazine/cyclodextrin complex. Advantageously, the<br>
interaction agent is either a surfactant, for example sodium<br>
laurel sulfate or Tween, an acid, or a base. Advantageously,<br>
it is an acid or a base.<br>
In an advantageous way, the interaction agent is selected from<br>
among an amino acid, a carboxylic acid, an acetate, a<br>
carboxylate, an amine, or ammonia. In an even more<br>
advantageous way, is selected from among acetic acid, tartaric<br>
acid, citric acid, gluconic acid, malic acid, lactic acid,<br>
maleic acid, fumaric acid, L-lysine, L-valine, L-isoleucine,<br>
L-arginine, and ammonia. Advantageously, it is an amino acid,<br>
in an advantageous way a basic amino acid. Arginine is<br>
particularly preferred, advantageously in its L- form.<br>
The present invention also relates to the use of the complex<br>
according to the present invention to increase the solubility<br>
and the bioavailability of mequitazine at basic pH,<br>
advantageously in the range between 7 and 10, and in an<br>
advantageous way still between 8 and 9. The preferred<br>
interaction agent is arginine, and the invention thus relates<br>
to mequitazine/ cyclodextrin/ arginine complexes and their use<br>
to increase mequitazine solubility and bioavailability at<br>
basic pH, advantageously in the range between 7 and 10, and in<br>
'an advantageous way still between 8 and 9.<br>
Advantageously the cyclodextrin is selected from among the<br>
group consisting of the cyclodextrins, modified cyclodextrins,<br>
and their mixture. In an advantageous way, it is (3-<br>
cyclodextrin, methyl-(3-cyclodextrin, Y~cyclodex.tr in, or<br>
hydroxypropyl-(3-cyclodextrin. Advantageously, it is (3-<br>
cyclodextrin.<br>
In the sense of the present invention, "rate of<br>
solubilization" means the percentage of solubilized<br>
mequitazine after stirring a mixture of water and mequitazine<br>
for 15 minutes at 37 °C. A mixture of 2 g/1 of mequitazine in<br>
water is usually used to measure this rate. This<br>
solubilization can be measured by a solubilization test as<br>
indicated below.<br>

line of the controls.<br>
Calculate the concentration in ug/ml of solubilized<br>
mequitazine by multiplying by the inverse of the dilution made<br>
(i.e., 200).<br>
The rate of solubility of mequitazine is calculated by<br>
dividing the concentration of solubilized mequitazine by the<br>
total concentration of mequitazine in the starting solution.<br>
The mequitazine/ cyclodextrin/ interaction agent complexes are<br>
likely to be obtained by a process such as described<br>
hereafter.<br>
A method of preparing a complex according to the present<br>
invention includes the following successive steps:<br>
a) placing mequitazine in contact with a cyclodextrin and an<br>
interaction agent;<br>
b) implementing a molecular diffusion step by placing in<br>
contact in static mode a dense fluid under pressure with<br>
the mixture obtained in step (a) in the presence of one<br>
or more diffusion agents;<br>
c) recovering the mequitazine/ cyclodextrin/ interaction<br>
agent complex thus formed.<br>
The complex thus recovered in step (c) is in solid form.<br>
However, it may still contain some water molecules or be<br>
moist. In order to eliminate any trace of water, in another<br>
advantageous embodiment, step (c) is followed by a step (d) of<br>
drying the complex, advantageously between 60 °C and 80 °C,<br>
advantageously at 60 °C and in an advantageous way overnight.<br>
This drying, which is optional, thus makes it possible to<br>
remove any trace of residual water present in the complex<br>
following step (c).<br>
The step of molecular diffusion in static mode, step (b) <br>
termed the maturation step, essentially consists of a<br>
molecular diffusion phase in a dense milieu under pressure,<br>
and in particular supercritical, that enables mequitazine to<br>
be included in cyclodextrins. The objective sought during this<br>
phase of diffusion is to form inclusion complexes between<br>
mequitazine, the cyclodextrin, and the interaction agent.<br>
The complex thus formed associates mequitazine, the<br>
cyclodextrin, and the interaction agent noncovalently.<br>
The interaction agent interacts according to two plausible<br>
hypotheses: strong interactions with the mequitazine included<br>
in the cyclodextrin and/or strong interactions with the<br>
complex formed.<br>
The presence of this interaction agent primarily makes it<br>
possible to improve the dissolution properties of the complex<br>
in biological liquids, in particular water, and to possibly<br>
increase the rate of inclusion of mequitazine in the<br>
cyclodextrin.<br>
The improvement of the physicochemical properties, in<br>
particular in terms of dissolution of the system formed may<br>
originate in:<br>
- noncovalent interaction of the interaction agent with<br>
mequitazine, the cyclodextrin, or both (complexation,<br>
salification, etc.)/<br>
- local pH variation in the dissolution medium,<br>
- presence of an eutectic system,<br>
- modification of the interface between the system and<br>
its dissolution medium (surfactant effect, granulometric<br>
change).<br>
In the sense of the present invention, "dense fluid under<br>
pressure" means any fluid used at a temperature or a pressure<br>
greater than its critical value. Advantageously C02 may be<br>
used pure or as mixture with an organic solvent classically<br>
used by those skilled in the art.<br>
In the sense of the present invention, "diffusion agent" means<br>
any solvent that favors an interaction of mequitazine with a<br>
cyclodextrin.<br>
Advantageously, this diffusion agent is selected from among<br>
the group consisting of the alcohols, ketones, ethers, esters,<br>
and water, with or without a surfactant, and their mixtures.<br>
In an even more advantageous way, water is selected.<br>
In the sense of the present invention, "static mode" means a<br>
reaction or a process in which all of the reagents are<br>
simultaneously placed together and where the reaction is<br>
allowed to progress. For example, in step (b) of the present<br>
invention, into an autoclave are placed the substances of the<br>
complex, water, and supercritical C02, and the reaction is<br>
allowed to progress for several hours. The mass of the product<br>
does not change during the reaction. On the contrary, in<br>
dynamic mode, the reagents are supplied as the reaction or<br>
production progresses. Often within the framework of dynamic<br>
mode, there is circulation of a fluid. The mass of the product<br>
changes during production.<br>
In an advantageous way, molecular diffusion step (b) of the<br>
method according to the present invention is carried out under<br>
stirring.<br>
In a particular embodiment of the invention, during step (a)<br>
mequitazine, the interaction agent, and the cyclodextrin are<br>
introduced in solid or liquid form into a receptacle into<br>
which during step (b) is injected the dense fluid under<br>
pressure and the diffusion agent in judiciously selected<br>
proportions. Pressure and temperature conditions, as well as<br>
the duration of treatment, are defined by any suitable method.<br>
The diffusion agent can be added continuously or<br>
discontinuously in a quantity ranging between 1 and 50% in<br>
mass compared to the total mass of the mixture, preferably<br>
between 10 and 25% in mass compared to total mass of the<br>
mixture.<br>
The time necessary for the molecular diffusion in step (b) is<br>
determined by any suitable method. Step (b) may be repeated as<br>
many times as desired to obtain a satisfactory rate of<br>
dissolution. Advantageously, step (b) lasts between<br>
approximately 1 and 16 hours, advantageously 2 hours.<br>
The pressure and temperature conditions in step (b) are chosen<br>
in a way to favor molecular diffusion. Advantageously the<br>
pressure of the supercritical fluid lies between 0.5 MPa and<br>
50 MPa, advantageously 15 MPa, and the temperature between 0<br>
and 200 °C, advantageously 75 °C.<br>
Advantageously step (b) of the process is implemented in a<br>
closed reactor, in particular an autoclave.<br>
The process can be implemented in batches or continuously. In<br>
an advantageous way the process according to the present<br>
invention is carried out in batches.<br>
The mequitazine/cyclodextrin/interaction agent molar ratio can<br>
be chosen in a way to ensure optimal inclusion of mequitazine<br>
within the cyclodextrins. Thus, advantageously the<br>
mequitazine/cyclodextrin molar ratio lies between 1/1 and<br>
1/10, advantageously between 1/1 and 1/5, and in an<br>
advantageous way between 1/2 and 1/3. In the same advantageous<br>
way the mequitazine/interaction agent molar ratio lies between<br>
1/1 and 1/10, advantageously between 1/1 and 1/5, and in an<br>
advantageous way between 1/1 and 1/3.<br>
Advantageously, step (b) of the process is implemented in a<br>
closed reactor, possibly under stirring, supplied with the<br>
dense fluid and the mequitazine solution, continuously if need<br>
be.<br>
The present invention relates moreover to a pharmaceutical<br>
composition, intended to be administered by oral route, that<br>
includes a complex according to the present invention, and<br>
possibly a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient.<br>
It concerns moreover a complex according to the present<br>
invention or a pharmaceutical composition according to the<br>
present invention for its use as a drug, advantageously<br>
intended to treat allergies.<br>
The following examples, given as indications, were carried out<br>
with mequitazine in racemic form and/or D- or L- enantiomer<br>
form, with the additional use of |3-cyclodextrin, water as a<br>
diffusion agent, and arginine as an interaction agent.<br>
COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 1: Creation of mequitazine/(3-cyclodextrin<br>
complexes.<br>
2.5 grams of mequitazine in racemic or L- or D- form, 20.11<br>
grams of (3-cyclodextrin, and 5.11 grams of water are mixed and<br>
introduced into a 500 ml reactor. Carbon dioxide is then<br>
introduced into the reactor under a pressure of 15 MPa and at<br>
a temperature of 75 °C. The unit is maintained under these<br>
operating conditions for 2 hours. The powder thus collected<br>
after releasing the medium is placed in a drying oven at 60 °C<br>
overnight.<br>
The solubility and the rates of solubilization of complexed<br>
mequitazine (D, L, or racemic) are measured as indicated above<br>
in the "mequitazine solubilization test". The results are<br>
collected in Table 1 and represented in Figure 1 below.<br>
EXAMPLE 2: Creation of mequitazine/ft-cyclodextrin/arginine<br>
complexes.<br>
The procedure is identical to that of Example 1, only the<br>
quantities of the reagents change. 2.5 grams of mequitazine in<br>
racemic or L- or D- form, 20.11 grams of |3-cyclodextrin, 1.35<br>
grams of arginine, and 5.63 grams of water are used.<br>
The solubility and the rates of solubilization of complexed<br>
mequitazine (D, L, or racemic) are measured as indicated above<br>
in the "mequitazine solubilization test". The results are<br>
collected in Table 1 and represented in Figure 1 below.<br>
COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE: Solubility of racemic, L-, and Dmequitazine<br>
taken separately and physical mixtures of<br>
mequitazine/(3-cyclodextrin and mequitazine/ftcyclodextrin/<br>
arginine.<br>
Moreover, the rates of solubilization of the mequitazine<br>
obtained thanks to the use of the complexes according to the<br>
present invention are compared with the rates of<br>
solubilization obtained with the simple<br>
cyclodextrin/mequitazine mixture and optionally an interaction<br>
agent, such a mixture is called a "physical mixture" and has<br>
nothing in common with complexes.<br>
Creation of a "physical mixture":<br>
A "physical mixture" corresponds to the simple mixture of the<br>
components but in a non-complexed form. It is thus a question<br>
of using the molar ratios of mequitazine/cyclodextrin and<br>
possibly arginine as interaction agent used to create the<br>
complexes, and to carry out solubility tests on these<br>
"physical mixtures".<br>
Thus the superiority of the complexes according to the present<br>
invention can be demonstrated, in particular compared to<br>
simple physical mixtures which correspond, for example, to the<br>
product described in patent application FR 2 742 053.<br>
The solubility and the rates of solubilization of mequitazine<br>
only or mequitazine in physical mixtures are measured as<br>
indicated above in the "mequitazine solubilization test".<br>
The solubilization results are collected in Table 1 and<br>
represented in Figure 1 below.<br>
14<br>
Table 1: Rate of solubilization of mequitazine in the various<br>
samples: mequitazine alone, in a simple physical mixture, or<br>
in complex with cyclodextrin or cyclodextrin and arginine.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Figure 1 represents the rates of solubilization of mequitazine<br>
for the various samples tested at 37 °C after 15 minutes of<br>
stirring for a 2 g/1 solution of mequitazine.<br>
Thus it can be noted that the complexes according to the<br>
present invention allow a particularly increased mequitazine<br>
solubility, to be specific at pH 9. Such a pH is particularly<br>
interesting because it corresponds to intestinal pH. It can<br>
also be noted that mequitazine alone has a very low solubility<br>
at this pH.<br>
A difference in solubility between racemic mequitazine and<br>
when complexed with either enantiomer can also be noted. It<br>
appears that in the complexed form the enantiomer complexes<br>
have the best solubility.<br>
It is also observed that the simple physical component<br>
mixtures, even if they make it possible to increase the rate<br>
of dissolution of mequitazine, do not make it possible to<br>
obtain results as satisfactory as those obtained with the<br>
complexes. Thus, with the complexes, the rate of dissolution<br>
is increased by a factor of approximately 3. In the same way,<br>
simple complexation without an interaction agent does not make<br>
it possible to obtain results as satisfactory as those<br>
obtained with the complexes according to the present<br>
invention.<br><br><br><br><br>
