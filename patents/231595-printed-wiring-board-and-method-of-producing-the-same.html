				<td>LIGHTWEIGHT CIRCUIT BOARD WITH CONDUCTIVE CONSTRAINING CORES<br>
STATEMENT REGARDING FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH OR DEVELOPMENT<br>
Certain portions of the background technology to the present invention were made<br>
under one CM- more of the following United States Government Contracts: NAS 3-27743; NAS 3-97040; and F 29601-94-C-0093. Accordingly, the United States Government may have some rights.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Multiple-layer printed circuit boards or printed wiring boards (PWBs) are used for mounting integrated circuits (ICs) and other components. The push to decrease circuit size and weight and to operate at higher frequencies and clock speeds has led to smaller components generating greater heat and being placed more closely together on the PWB. Additional size and speed improvements have also been achieved by reducing the footprints of the components by using Icadless chip carriers.<br>
The greater density of components on the PWBs and hotter components resulted in thermal management problems. The Coefficient of Thermal Expansion ("CTE") mismatch between the PWBs and the components becomes more important when greater temperatures are generated. CTE mismatch between the PWBs and components can result in fracture or fatigue during the thermal cycling caused by powering on and off of electronic devices Leadless chip carriers are especially susceptible to disengagement from the PWB when there are CTE mismatches. Solder joints and connections tend to pull apart in the "tug-of-war" introduced by the CTE mismatch.<br>
Prior PWB designs have used metal constraining layers or cores, such as copper-invar-copper, aluminum or steel, to lower the board's CTE. However, these materials add undesirable weight. US Patent 4,318,954 to Jensen provides an example of a PWB design for use in cycling thermal environments that uses lightweight carbon based constraining layers to lower the board's CTE. US Patent 4,591,659 to Leibowitz also demonstrates that carbon constraining layers can serve as thermal conductors for carrying heat away from the components mounted on the PWB in addition to lowering the board's CTE. US Patent 4,318,954 to Jensen and US Patent 4,591,659 to Leibowitz are incorporated by reference in their entirety to the present disclosure.<br><br>
The ability of previous PWBs to conduct heat away from the components mounted on their surfaces is limited by die prepreg used to prevent electrical conductivity between the functional layers of the PWB. The materials used in prepreg have poor thermal conduction properties. Therefore, the ability of the carbon constraining layer to conduct heat away from the surface of the board was limited by the amount of prepreg between it and the surface of the board. The carbon material used in the carbon constraining layers is electrically conductive, which required the functional layers of the PWB in prior structures to be electrically insulated from the carbon constraining layers in order to prevent short circuits and cross talk. In previous designs, this requirement places a lower limit on the distance between the carbon constraining layers and the surface of the board equivalent to the minimum amount of prepreg required to insulate the functional layers of the board from each other and from the carbon constraining layers. This lower limit translated into an upper limit on the amount of heat that could be conducted away from the surface of the PWB. Accordingly mere was a need far a PWB that possessed mechanical strength with.a low CTE and that exceeds the upper limit on the amount of heat that can be conducted away from the surface of me PWB which was inherent in previous designs.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In one aspect, the invention relates to a structure and method in which a thermally conductive layer is provided in a PWB or a portion thereof. For example, the invention may include a prepreg layer made of a substitute impregnated with a resin which is thermally conductive, and possibly also electrically conductive. A laminate may be formed from such a prepreg layer, the laminate having first and second metallic layers positioned above and below the prepreg. Alternatively, the laminate may itself be thermally and/or electrically conductive, enabling its use in a high performance printed wiring board.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Referring now to the drawings, FIGURE 1 illustrates a lightweight multiple-layer PWB in accordance with the present invention. The PWB 10 includes a laminate 12 comprising a carbon cemtaining layer 14 sandwiched between a first layer of metal or other electrically conductive material 16 and a second layer of metal or other electrically conductive material 18, The laminate is sandwiched between a first layer of prepreg 20 and a second layer of prepreg 22. The top layer of the PWB is constructed from a third layer of metal or other electrically conductive material 24. The bottom layer of the PWB is constructed using a fourth layer of metal or other electrically conductive material 26. As set forth below, the electrically conductive layers 16, 18, 24 and 26, aud the corresponding layers of the other embodiments described herein, may be made of metal or any of a variety of metal-containing compositions having suitable properties of electrical conduction. For convenience, however, these layers often will be referred to herein simply as "metal" layers.<br>
The laminate 12 is electrically conductive, which enables the laminate to be used as a ground plane within the PWB, a power plane within a PWB or both a ground and power plane in tiie PWB where routing is used to electrically isolate portions of the laminate. Use of the laminate 12 in a PWB results in the PWB being thinner and having less weight than previous PWB designs that utilize electrically insulated carbon containing layers to lower the CTE. Reducing the thickness of the PWB 10 also enables the carbon containing layers 14 to be located closer to the surface of the board than in PWBs that utilize electrically insulated carbon constraining layers. An advantage of this configuration is that it gives die PWB increased ability to transfer heat away from its surface compared to previous designs Another advantage of mis configuration is that it provides low surface CTE which is important in applications such as semiconductor applications.<br>
A prepreg is a composite layer that includes a substrate or supporting material composed of fibrous material tnat is impregnated with resin. A prepreg may also be a film. A film is a type of prepreg that does not include a substrate but is instead a composite that only includes resins. The first prepreg layer 20 and the second prepreg layer 22 electrically insulate the electrically conductive laminate 12 fcom the third layer of metal 24 and the fourth layer of metal 26. In one preferred embodiment, the third and fourth layers of metal or other electrically conductive material are patterned with electrical circuits. For example, electrical contact between the third layer of metal, the electrically conductive laminate or the fourth layer of metal can result in the functions of the electrical circuits patterned onto the third and<br><br>
fourth layers of metal being interrupted.  In other embodiments, only one of the third and fourth layers of metal are patterned with electrical circuits.<br>

In one preferred embodiment the top and bottom layers of conductive material are constructed from materials similar to those used in the construction of the first and second layers of metal as described above.<br>
One preferred embodiment of a method of manufacturing PWBs in accordance with the present invention is illustrated in FIG. 2A. A first lamination is performed in the step 32.<br><br>
The first lamination involves placing a 1/4 oz layer of copper foil on one side of a layer of woven carbon fibers impregnated with the epoxy based pyrolitic carbon resin, as described above, and placing a second 1/4 oz layer of copper foil on the other side of the layer of woven carbon fibers. The layers are then placed in a vacuum and heated from room temperature to 3 SOT.   The temperature increase is controlled so that the temperature rise is maintained within the range of 8 - 12 "FAnin as the temperature rises from 150CF to 300°F,  When the temperature is in the range 150T - 165°F, the pressure on the layers is increased to 250 PSI. Once a temperature of 350°F has been reached, the temperature is maintained at that temperature for 70 minutes. After the completion of the 70 minute time period, the layers are exposed to room temperature and a pressure greater than atmospheric pressure for a period of 30 minutes.   The first lamination cycle produces the electrically conductive laminate 12 described above.   Preferably, the electrically conductive laminate is manufactured to be as flat as possible.<br>
The first lamination cycle is followed by a second lamination cycle in the step 34. The second lamination cycle involves placing a layer 44N0680 prepreg on one side of the electrically conductive laminate produced in the first lamination cycle and a second layer of 44N0680 prepreg on the other side of the electrically conductive laminate, hi addition, layers of 1/2 oz copper foil are placed on the outside surfaces of the two layers of 44N0680 prepreg. The layers are then placed in a vacuum and heated from room temperature to 350°F. The temperature increase is controlled so that tne temperature rise is maintained within the range of 8 - 12 °F/min as the temperature rises from 150°F to 300°F. When the temperature is in the range 150"F - 165°F, the pressure on the layers is increased to 250 PSI. Once a temperature of 350°F has been reached, the temperature is maintained at that temperature for 90 minutes. After the completion of the 90 minute time period, the layers are exposed to room temperature and a pressure greater than atmospheric pressure for a period of 30 minutes. The first lamination cycle produces the electrically conductive laminate 12 described above. The second lamination cycle produces the PWB 10 shown in FIG. I. The third and fourth layers of metal of the PWB 10 shown in FIG. 1 are then patterned with electrical circuits in the step 36.<br>
One preferred embodiment of a process 40 for impregnating a layer containing carbon constructed from woven carbon fiber with an electrically conductive resin is illustrated in FIG. 2B. The first step in the process 42 involves adding together ingredients to form a resin. Most resins are formed using epoxy or polyimide solid state resin, solvent, acetones,<br><br>
catalysts and additives. Typically, the properties of a particular resin arc determined by the various additives included in the resm and the quantities of these additives. Additives can be used to increase the electrical conductivity or the thermal properties of a resin. When an additive is used to increase the electrical or thermal conductivity of a resin, the thermal or electrical conductivity of a resin increases with the amount of the additive mixed through the resin. In one preferred embodiment, an amount of pyrolitic carbon in powder form equal to 10% by weight of the resin is added as an ingredient to increase the electrical conductivity and thermal properties of the resin. In other embodiments, any amount of pyrolitic carbon can be added to improve the thermal and electrical properties of the resin. Preferably, the amount of pyrolitic carbon added to the resin is between 5% to 50% by weight of the resin. The various resin ingredients are then mixed in the step 44 to form a substantially homogenous resin.<br>
Once a resin is formed, the resin is placed in a prepreg treater in the step 46. The prepreg treater is used to impregnate a substrate with resin. In the next step 48, the substrate to be impregnated is passed through the prepreg treater. la one preferred embodiment of the process, the substrate material is woven carbon fibers such as the woven carbon fiber materials described above. In one preferred embodiment using a woven carbon fiber substrate, me substrate is impregnated with 45% by weight resin. In other embodiments, the substrate is impregnated with between 5% to 80% by weight resin.<br>
Once the substrate has been passed through the prepreg treater, the B-stage curing cycle is performed in the step 50. The B-stage curing cycle involves exposing the substrate and resin to a temperature of between 250°F to 300°F. The amount of time that the substrate and resin are exposed to this temperature is determined by the amount of resin loaded onto the substrate and the extent of curing required. In one preferred embodiment, a time period of 15 minutes is required for the impregnation of a woven carbon fiber substrate with 45% resin cured to B-stage so that it is suitable for use in the process described above in relation to FIG. 2 A. Upon the completion of the B-stage curing cycle, the resin is stored in a controlled environment prior to use in the step 52.<br>
In other embodiments, silver oxide particles are used as a resin additive to increase the electrical conductivity and thermal properties of the resin. In one preferred embodiment, an amount of silver oxide equal to 40% by weight of the resin is added. La other embodiments, any amount of silver oxide can be added to increase the thermal properties of<br><br>
the resin. Preferably, the amount of silver oxide added to the resin will be between 5% and 70% by weight of the resin.<br>
ID other embodiments, boron nitride particles are used as a resin additive to increase the thermal properties of fee resin. ID one preferred embodiment, an amount of" boron nitride equal to 40% by weight of the resin is added. In other embodiments,, any amount of boron nitride can be added to increase the thermal properties of the resin. Preferably, the amount of boron nitride added to the resin will be between 5% and 70% by weight of the resin.<br>
In other embodiments, diamond particles are used as a resin additive to increase the thermal properties of the resin. In oae preferred embodiment, an amount of diamond particles equal to 15% by weight of the resin is added. In other embodiments, any amount of diamond particles can be added to increase the thermal properties of the resin. Preferably, the amount of diamond particles added to the resin will be between 2% to 50% by weight of the resin.<br>
In other embodiments, aluminum oxide particles are used as a resin additive to increase the thermal properties of the resin. In. one preferred embodiment, an amount of aluminum oxide equal to 40% by weight of the resin is added. In other embodiments, any amount of aluminum oxide can be added to increase the thermal properties of the resia. Preferably, the amount of aluminum oxide added to the resin will be between 5% to 70% by weight of the resin. In other embodiments, two or more of the additives described above can be used as additives to form a resin.<br>
hi other embodiments, prepregs can be manufactured using the above process by using substrate materials that have dielectric constants less than 6.0 at 1 MHz. In one preferred embodiment, a fiberglass substrate is impregnated with a resin containing boron nitride to produce a thermally conductive prcpreg with a dielectric constant less than 6.0 at 1 MHz. Preferably, the fiberglass is impregnated with 70% by weight resia, In other embodiments, the fiberglass is impregnated with between 20% and 80% by weight resin.<br>

A closer inspection of FIG- 10 reveals that the PWB 10"" includes a number of plated holes. The PWB 10"" includes chimneys 128 that are holes filled with thermally conductive material. The chimneys are used to transport heat from the surface of the PWB to the electrically and thermally conductive laminates within the PWB. The chimneys do not<br><br>
extend all the way through the PWB. If the chimneys contacted both the first and second laminates, then the chimneys could short circuit the PWB. The PWB 10'.'" also includes through holes 130 lined with electrically conductive material that are used to establish electrical connections between the functional layers in the PWB. Where connections between the plated through holes and the first or second laminates are not desired, then an annulus of dielectric material 132 such as an epoxy resin with a dielectric constant less than 6.0 at 1 MHz can be used to ensure that an electrical connection does not exist between the laminate and the electrically conductive lining of the through hole.<br>
A process in accordance with the present invention for manufacturing the PWB 10"" illustrated in FIG. 10 is shown in FIG. 11A. The process 150 commences with the step 152, which involves constructing two laminates in accordance with the present invention are formed using the process described above in relation to FIG. 2A. Power or ground regions are then patterned on the laminates in the step 154. The patterning electrically isolates regions within the laminate, which can enable laminate to function as a ground or power plane within a PWB.<br>
Once the patterning is complete, the laminates are subjected to oxide treatment in the step 156. After oxide treatment, clearance hole drilling is performed in the step 158. Clearance hole drilling involves drilling holes in the laminate of a first diameter and filling the resulting holes with a dielectric material such as any of the resins described above with a dielectric constant less than 6.0 at 1 MHz. Prior to filling the drilled holes, they are inspected and cleaned using high pressure dry air.<br>
Once tine clearance holes have been drilled, the second lamination cycle is performed in the step 160. The second lamination cycle is similar to the second lamination cycle described above in relation to FIG. 2A, After the second lamination cycle, chimney holes are drilled into the PWB in the step 162. Once the chimney holes have been drilled, the linings of the chimney holes are lined witb a thermally conductive material in the step 164. Preferably, the thermally conductive material is copper. In other embodiments, any material with a thermal conductivity greater than 5 WAn.K can be used.<br>
After the chimney holes have been lined, circuits are etched onto the layers of metal that will be located within the interior of the finished PWB are patterned in the step 166 and then subjected to oxide treatment in the step 168.<br>
Following the oxide treatment, 1he third lamination is performed in the step 170. The third lamination involves aligning the two structures produced in the second lamination with<br><br>
additional prepreg layers to correspond with the layers of the PWB 10"" illustrated in FIG. 10. The layers are then exposed to temperatures and pressures similar to those experienced during the second lamination cycle.<br>
After the third lamination cycle, the final through hole drilling is performed in step 172. The final through hole drilling involves drilling holes through the entire PWB that have a. second diameter, which is less than the first diameter described above. The through holes are then lined in the step 174. Preferably, the through holes are lined with copper. In other embodiments, the through holes can be plated with materials similar to those that can be used in the construction of the layers of metal If a through hole passes through one of the filled clearance holes in a laminate, then the lining of the through holes are electrically isolated from the laminate in which the clearance hole is drilled, If a through hole does not pass through one of the fitted clearance holes in a laminate, then the lining of the through hole is in electrical contact with the laminate.<br>
An embodiment of a process for selecting the locations in which to drill chimney holes in a PWB is illustrated in FIG. 1 IB. The process 190 includes a first step 192, which involves creating a model of the structure of the PWB. The second step 194 involves adding a thermally conductive material such as copper to the outermost layers of metal on the model. The thermally conductive material is added to the model such that the thennally conductive material does not create any electrical contacts with the circuits patterned onto the layers of metal on which the thennally conductive material is added.<br>
Once the thermally conductive material has been added, the locations of the chimney holes are determined hi the step 196. The locations of the chimney holes are determined by choosing a location on the surface of the PWB that ties within an area where thennally conductive material was add*** during step 194. The location is a suitable location for a chimney if a hole of a specified diameter corresponding to the diameter of the chimney can be drilled through the PWB without intersecting any of the electrical circuits patterned onto layers of metal internal to the PWB. Otherwise, the chosen location is unsuitable as a location for drilling a chimney hole. The number of locations that must be found is dependent upon the amount of heat required to be conducted away from the surface of the board<br>
An embodiment of a process for selecting the location of the filled clearance holes in the laminates is illustrated in FIG. 11C. The process 200 includes a first step 202, which involves constructing a model of the PWB. The locations of the through holes in the PWB are<br><br>
used to determine the locations in which the through holes intersect the ground plane laminate or the power plane laminate in the step 204. Once these locations have been determined, the locations of fee clearance holes are chosen in the step 206 as the locations where the through holes intersect the ground or power plane laminates and where an electrical connection between the lining of the plated through hole and the ground or power plane laminate is undesirable.<br>
A PWB in accordance with the present invention incorporating laminates in accordance with the present invention and an additional carbon containing layer is illustrated in FIG. 12. The PWB 10'"" has a first laminate 120', a second laminate 122', an additional carbon containing layer 210, prepreg layers 124' and layers of metal 126'. Preferably, the first laminate forms a ground plane and the second laminate forms a power plane. The additional carbon containing layer 210, does not act as a ground or power plane and is electrically isolated from the laminates and the layers of metal. The additional carbon containing layer increases the thermal conductivity and stiffness of the PWB and improves the CTE of the PWB. Similar materials to those used in the construction of the laminates, prepreg layers and layers of metal of the PWB 10 illustrated in FIG. 1 can also be used to construct the laminates, prepreg layers and layers of metal of the PWB 10'"" illustrated in FIG. 12. The additional carbon containing layer can be constructed using the similar materials to those that can be used in the construction of the carbon containing layers of the laminates illustrated at 12 in FIG. 1,12' in FIG. 3,12" in FIG. 4, 12"' in FIG. 5 and 12"" in FIG. 6.<br>
The PWB 10'"" in FIG. 12 can be constructed using a processes similar to those described above in relation to FIGS 11A - 11C. The only difference is in the arrangement of the materials used in the construction of the third lamination cycle and the fact that filled clearance holes must also be drilled in the additional carbon containing layer 210 so that the additional carbon containing layer is electrically isolated from the linings of any through holes present in the PWB.<br><br>
