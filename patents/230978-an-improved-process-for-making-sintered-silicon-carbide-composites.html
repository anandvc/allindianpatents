				<td>The present invention relates to an improved process for making sintered silicon carbide composites.<br>
The present invention particularly relates to an improved process for making sintered silicon carbide composites with ceramisable glass p owder additive.<br>
The sintered SiC with ceramisable additive has application as nozzle, pump-seals, kiln-furniture, and for making components in the field of machines with static and moving parts where the atmosphere is oxidising or neutral or reducing and where the operation takes place at room temperature, below room temperature and at an elevated temperature up to 2000°C. The said article may also be used as special refractory material where thermal shock, abrasion, corrosion, oxidativc corrosion etc. are to be countered at room temperature, below room temperature and at an elevated temperature up to 200()°C.<br>
The present day method of making sinlcicd silicon carbide essciilially coiutinl of using oxides of different metals like aluminium, yttrium, rare earth, magnesium and their combinations as additives, hi some cases boron, carbon and aluminium is used in elemental form either alone or in combination with oxide additives. Aluminium and boron nitride is also used in some cases of which reference may be made to "method for preparing sintered shapes of silicon carbide-M. Omori and H. Takei, U.S. Pat. 4564490. 1986" where oxide additives in combination with alumina promote sintering of silicon carbide. Magnesia-alumina combination was used by M. D. Trigg.-Australia Patent 00518, 1990. M. D. Trigg. also used sialon as an additive-Australian Patent 00271, 1988. Yima-.iluminium nitride combination was used by W. D. G. Bocker, European Patent 419271AZ, 1990. Advantage of formation of silicon carbide-aluminium nitride was used for sintciing of silicon carbide by G. Erwin(Jr.)-US Patent 3492153, 1970.<br>
In all the above processes the main drawbacks may be listed as below:<br>
1.	An inert atmosphere for firing is to be maintained.<br>
2.	The fuel consumption per unit mass of products are high.<br>
3.	The environmental pollution due to fuel cannot be avoided except in<br>
electrical heating.<br>
4.	Non uniform heating of components in the furnace are very common .<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide an improved process<br>
for making of silicon carbide composites with ceramisable glass powder additive which obviates the drawbacks as detailed above.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to eliminate the use of inert atmosphere for firing the products.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to increase the fuel efficiency of the process by sintering in microwave generating furnace.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to reduce the level of environmental pollution.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to ensure higher level of uniformity of fired products.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provide an improved process for making sintered silicon carbide composites with ceramisable glass powder additive, which comprises 1) mixing of silicon carbide powder of various fineness such as 1 m2/g to 16 rn2/g with 5 to 50 weight percent of ceramisable glass powder additive of the kind as herein described essentially containing a nucleating agent selected from TiO2, and ZrO2 2) forming green shapes, 3) drying the green shapes at a temperature in the range of 40°C to 150°C for a time of 10 to 200 minutes, 4) encapsulating the dried sample into silicon carbide crucible, 5) loading the encapsulated samples into a microwave generating system with a power output of 0.8 kW to 5 kW, fired for 0.5 to 8.0 hours and 6)heat treating the fired shapes at a temperature in the range of 600°C to 900°C for 60 to 1200 minutes in an inert atmosphere.<br>
encapsulating the dried sample in silicon carbide crucible, loading the encapsulated samples into a microwave generating system with a power output of 0.8 kW to 5 kW, fired for 0.5 to 8.0 hours and heat treating (lie fired shapes at a temperature in the range of 600°C to 900°C for 60 to 1200 minutes in ambient atmosphere.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention silicon carbide powder used may be such as a or p-variety.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention the ceramisable glass powder additive used, may be such as Li2O-Al2O3 -SiO2, MgO- ;U2O3 -SiO2, Na2O-BaO A12O3 -SiO2, essentially containing a nucleating agent such as TiO2, ZrO2.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention forming may be done by the processes such as uniaxial pressing, isostatic pressing, slip casting.<br>
hi yet another embodiment of the present invention the heat treatment may be done in an inert atmosphere, such as nitrogen, argon, helium.<br>
The details of the process of invention are given below:<br>
1.	Silicon carbide powder is mixed with 5-50% of ceramisable glass powder additive<br>
by milling.<br>
2.	Milled powder is formed into shapes by different forming methods  such as slip<br>
casting, uniaxial pressing or isostatic pressing.<br>
3.	The formed articles are dried in oven at 40 - 150°C.<br>
4.	Dried articles are placed in silicon carbide crucibles.<br>
5.	Silicon carbide crucibles containing formed articles are loaded in microwave<br>
heating system.<br>
6.	Microwave power generated is 0.8 to 5 kW for O.'i to 8 hours.<br>
7.        The fired shapes were heat treated at a temperature in the range of 6GO°C to 900°C<br>
for 60 to 1200 minutes.<br>
The process of the present invention can be used to produce sintered silicon carbide and silicon carbide based composite materials consisting of additives of various shapes and sizes required for application as engineering as well as special refractory material.<br>
Silicon carbide can only be sintered by the help of additives due to its high covalency. Moreover, for efficient sintering or consolidation particle size of SiC powder should be very small. SiC is easily oxidised, and extent of oxidation increases rapidly with increasing surface area of silicon carbide powder. This require some inert atmosphere like N2, Ar, or He during firing of SiC green compacts. Due to high covalency factor, sintering should be conducted at a very high temperature. SiC may be compacted or consolidated at lower temperature by using a low melting; glass. But due to low melting point of the bonding materials, the properties of such products will render it unusable for most of the specialised applications.<br>
If such glass may be crystallised in a controlled way, after consolidation of the<br>
products, the properties will be improved to a large extent and will make the product usable<br>
for specialised applicatioas.	,<br>
In the present system SiC was consolidated by a ceramisable glass powder in a microwave generating system. As the volumetric heating of the samples occur during microwave firing, the silicon carbide particles remained away from atmospheric oxygen and consequently undesired oxidation of silicon carbide could be prevented.<br>
The novelty of the process of the present invention resides in avoiding oxidation of SiC during consolidation as well as presence of undesirable low melting glassy phase. Tims<br>
the present process enables to consolidate  SiC at     lower temperature without the requirement of any inert atmosphere and converting the undesirable glassy sintering aid into desirable crystalline phases in the final consolidated products. The inventive steps of the present invention are:<br>
(a)	The sintering additive containing ceramisable glass powder.<br>
(b)	The sintering being effected using microwave heating system.<br>
The above inventive steps result in avoidance of the presence of low melting glassy phase in the sintered silicon carbide composites and the sintering being carried out at lower temperature without the requirement of any inert atmosphere.<br>
The following examples arc given by way of illustration and therefore should not be construed the limit of the scope of the present invention.<br>
