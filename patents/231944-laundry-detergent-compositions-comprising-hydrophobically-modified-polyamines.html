				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a polyamine for use in a laundry detergent composition to provide enhanced lipid soil removal benefits, inter alia, body soil removal. The present invention further relates to nil surfactant laundry detergent compositions wherein aqueous solutions of hydrophobically modified polyamines are the foundation for laundry detergent compositions. The present invention also relates to methods for removing body soil from fabric, inter alia, the collars of wearing apparel.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Fabric, especially clothing, can become soiled with a variety of foreign substances ranging from hydrophobic stains (grease, oil) to hydrophilic stains (clay). The level of cleaning necessary to remove foreign substances depends to a large degree upon the amount of stain which is present and to the degree and manner in which the foreign substances has contacted the fabric fibers. Grass stains usually involve direct abrasive contact with vegetative matter thereby producing highly penetrating stains. Human body oils and perspiration are continually produced and deposited onto fabric while clothing is being worn, especially at the collar, cuffs, and underarms areas. Body oils become embedded into the fabric not only by absorption or by wicking of the materials themselves into the fiber, but also by the mechanical action of the body against the fabric.<br>
In many cases a surfactant per se is not all that is necessary to remove unwanted hydrophobic soils and stains. In the case of human body oils and other hydrophobic stains on collars, cuffs and other contact areas, perspiration and body oil stains are not fully removed by washing alone. Even hand scrubbing of collars does not ameliorate the dingy appearance of white cotton-comprising fabric. For hydrophobic soils, dispersants are ineffective because they act on soils whicha re removed and not on those which are embedded throughout the fabric surface fibers. Formulators have used soil release polymers to attenuate the spreading out and absorption of greasy, oily material onto synthetic fabric, however, cellulosic fiber still presents the laundry formulator with the problem of dingy appearance due to human body oils and perspiration stains.<br>
There is a long felt need in the art for laundry detergent compositions which can effectively solublize greasy, oily materials from the surface fibers of fabric, and once solublized, said oily materials can then be eliminated by the action of surfactants. There is also a long felt need for a cleaning system which effectively removes lipid type stains which have been worn into fabric by mechanical action of skin against fabric, for example, at shirt collars and cuffs.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It has now been surprisingly discovered that laundry detergent compositions comprising certain quatemized polyamines have enhanced greasy soil removal benefits. The polyamines of the present invention are fully quatemized alkyleneoxylated, preferably ethyleneoxylated, polyamines having hydrophobic backbone spacers between the backbone nitrogen atoms. Surprisingly the choice of a hydrophobic quatemizing agent provides enhanced removal of greasy, oily stains on clothing either in the presence of detersive surfactants or in the absence of surfactants. The laundry detergent compositions of the present invention are especially effective in removing "ground-in oily stains", inter alia, perspiration underarm stains, body oils at the collar and cuffs of shirts. When used together with a suitable surfactant system, the hydrophobically modified polyamines of the present invention provides for removal of stains which were once believed ruinous to fabric, especially cellulose comprising fabric.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to hydrophobically modified quatemized polyamines which are suitable for use in laundry detergent compositions. The hydrophobically modified polyamines of the present invention provide enhanced body soil and perspiration soil removal benefits.<br>
It has been surprisingly discovered that hydrophobically modified quatemized polyamines have increased effectiveness when treating fabric which is soiled with human body oils, perspiration, etc. Without wishing to be limited by theory, the hydrophobically modified quaternary polyamines of the present invention have an unexpected balance of properties which<br>
makes the compounds amenable to penetrating fabric to solublize greasy, oily stains, while maintaining water solubility, and preserving the particulate soil suspension properties needed to direct the dirt away from the fabric thereby avoiding re-deposition. In one preferred embodiment of the present invention, the hydrophobically modified polyamines are used to formulate cleaning composition comprising nil surfactants. In addition, the hydrophobically modified polyamines of the present invention reinforce the cleaning actions of high suds and high phosphate cleaning systems.<br>
The hydrophobically modified polyamines of the present invention do not aggregate onto the surface of fabric, whereas surfactants have a propensity to aggregate in this manner. Because the polyamines of the present invention do not form micelles there is no inter facial tension. This is particularly important with regard to the air/water interface where foam is formed. Therefore, low foaming can be achieved in the absence of foam reduction adjunct ingredients.<br>
The polyamines of the present invention, in the absence of surfactants, has a surprising effect against surfactant sensitive soils which affect fabric, inter alia, dingy soils, grease, and oil.<br>
When present in laundry detergent compositions, the polyamines are effective in an amount from about 0.01%, preferably from about 0.1%, more preferably from about 1%, most preferably from about 3% to about 50%, preferably to about 20%, more preferably to about 10%, most preferably to about 7% by weight, of said laundry detergent composition. Hydrophobically Modified Ouatemized Polyamines<br>
For the purposes of the present invention the term "hydrophobically modified" is defined herein as the "reaction of a linear polyamine comprising from 2 to 5 nitrogens wherein each nitrogen has its backbone hydrogens replaced by a polyalkyleneoxy unit comprising at least about 15 alkyleneoxy units, with at least one equivalent per nitrogen of a quatemizing agent, said quatemizing agents comprising a linear alkyl moiety having at least 8 carbon atoms, a cyclic alkyl moiety having at least 6 carbon atoms, an alkylenearyl unit, inter alia, benzyl, having at least 7 carbon atoms, or mixtures thereof.<br>
A "polyamine" for the purposes of the present invention is "an amine having less than 6 backbone nitrogen atoms and no branching", whereas for the purposes of the present invention, amines comprising more than 5 nitrogens are defined as "oligomeric amines" (oligoamines) or "polymeric amines" (polyalkyleneamines or polyalkyleneimines).<br>

The formuiator will recognize that when ethoxylating a polyamine, only an average number or statistical distribution of alkyleneoxy units will be know. Therefore, depending upon how "tightly" or how "exactly" a polyamine is alkoxylated, the average value may vary from embodiment to embodiment.<br>
Each Q is independently C8-C30 linear or branched alkyl, C6-C10 cycloalkyl, C7-C30 substituted or unsubstituted alkylenearyl, and mixtures thereof; preferably Q is a hydrophobic quaternizing unit selected from the group consisting of C7-C30 substituted or unsubstituted alkylenearyl, and mixtures thereof; more preferably benzyl, substituted benzyl, naphthyl, substituted naphthyl, and mixtures thereof.

The surfactant properties of the mid-chain branched aryl sulphonates of the present invention can be modified by varying the ratio of 2-phenyl to 3-phenyl isomers in the final surfactant mixture. A convenient means for describing the relative amounts of isomers present is the "2/3 phenyl index" defined herein as "100 times the quotient of the amount of 2-phenyl isomer present divided by the amount of the 3-phenyl isomer which is present". Any convenient means, NMR, inter alia, can be used to determine the relative amounts of isomers present. A preferred 2/3 phenyl index is at least about 275 which corresponds to at least 2.75 times more 2-phenyl isomer present than the 3-phenyl isomer in the surfactant mixture.

Enzyme Stabilizing System<br>
Enzyme-containing, including but not limited to, liquid compositions, herein may comprise from about 0.001%, preferably from about 0.005%, more preferably from about 0.01% to about 10%, preferably to about 8%, more preferably to about 6% by weight, of an enzyme stabilizing system. The enzyme stabilizing system can be any stabilizing system which is compatible with the detersive enzyme. Such a system may be inherently provided by other formulation actives, or be added separately, e.g., by the formulator or by a manufacturer of detergent-ready enzymes. Such stabilizing systems can, for example, comprise calcium ion, boric acid, propylene glycol, short chain carboxylic acids, boronic acids, and mixtures thereof, and are designed to address different stabilization problems depending on the type and physical form of the detergent composition.<br>
One stabilizing approach is the use of water-soluble sources of calcium and/or magnesium ions in die finished compositions which provide such ions to the enzymes. Calcium ions are generally more effective than magnesium ions and are preferred herein if only one type of cation is being used. Typical detergent compositions, especially liquids, will comprise from about 1 to about 30, preferably from about 2 to about 20, more preferably from about 8 to about 12 millimoles of calcium ion per liter of finished detergent composition, though variation is possible depending on factors including the multiplicity, type and levels of enzymes incorporated. Preferably water-soluble calcium or magnesium salts are employed, including for example calcium chloride, calcium hydroxide, calcium formate, calcium malate, calcium maleate, calcium hydroxide and calcium acetate; more generally, calcium sulfate or magnesium salts corresponding<br>
to the exemplified calcium salts may be used. Further increased levels of Calcium and/or Magnesium may of course be useful, for example for promoting the grease-cutting action of certain types of surfactant.<br>
Another stabilizing approach is by use of borate species disclosed in U.S. 4,537,706 Severson, issued August 27, 1985. Borate stabilizers, when used, may be at levels of up to 10% or more of the composition though more typically, levels of up to about 3% by weight of boric acid or other borate compounds such as borax or orthoborate are suitable for liquid detergent use. Substituted boric acids such as phenylboronic acid, butaneboronic acid, p-bromophenylboronic acid or the like can be used in place of boric acid and reduced levels of total boron in detergent compositions may be possible though the use of such substituted boron derivatives.<br>
Stabilizing systems of certain cleaning compositions may further comprise from 0, preferably from about 0.01% to about 10%, preferably to about 6% by weight, of chlorine bleach scavengers, added to prevent chlorine bleach species present in many water supplies from attacking and inactivating the enzymes, especially under alkaline conditions. While chlorine levels in water may be small, typically in the range from about 0.5 ppm to about 1.75 ppm, the available chlorine in the total volume of water that comes in contact with the enzyme, for example during fabric-washing, can be relatively large; accordingly, enzyme stability to chlorine in-use is sometimes problematic. Since perborate or percarbonate, which have the ability to react with chlorine bleach, may present in certain of the instant compositions in amounts accounted for separately from the stabilizing system, the use of additional stabilizers against chlorine, may, most generally, not be essential, though improved results may be obtainable from their use. Suitable chlorine scavenger anions are widely known and readily available, and, if used, can be salts containing ammonium cations with sulfite, bisulfite, thiosulfite, thiosulfate, iodide, etc. Antioxidants such as carbamate, ascorbate, etc., organic amines such as<br>
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) or alkali metal salt thereof, monoethanolamine (MEA), and mixtures thereof can likewise be used. Likewise, special enzyme inhibition systems can be incorporated such that different enzymes have maximum compatibility. Other conventional scavengers such as bisulfate, nitrate, chloride, sources of hydrogen peroxide such as sodium perborate tetrahydrate, sodium perborate monohydrate and sodium percarbonate, as well as phosphate, condensed phosphate, acetate, benzoate, citrate, formate, lactate, malate, tartrate, salicylate, etc., and mixtures thereof can be used if desired. In general, since the chlorine scavenger function can be performed by ingredients separately listed under better recognized functions, (e.g., hydrogen peroxide sources), there is no absolute requirement to add a separate chlorine scavenger unless a compound performing that function to the desired extent is absent<br>
from an enzyme-containing embodiment of the invention; even then, the scavenger is added only for optimum results. Moreover, the formulator will exercise a chemist's normal skill in avoiding the use of any enzyme scavenger or stabilizer which is majorly incompatible, as formulated, with other reactive ingredients, if used. In relation to the use of ammonium salts, such salts can be simply admixed with the detergent composition but are prone to adsorb water and/or liberate ammonia during storage. Accordingly, such materials, if present, are desirably protected in a particle such as that described in US 4,652,392 Baginski et al., issued March 24, 1987.<br>
ADJUNCT INGREDIENTS<br>
The following are non-limiting examples of adjunct ingredients useful in the laundry compositions of the present invention, said adjunct ingredients include builders, optical brighteners, soil release polymers, dye transfer agents, dispersents, enzymes, suds suppressers, dyes, perfumes, colorants, filler salts, hydrotropes, photoactivators, fluorescers, fabric conditioners, hydrolyzable surfactants, preservatives, anti-oxidants, chelants, stabilizers, anti-shrinkage agents, anti-wrinkle agents, germicides, fungicides, anti corrosion agents, and mixtures thereof.<br>
Builders - The laundry detergent compositions of the present invention preferably comprise one or more detergent builders or builder systems. When present, the compositions will typically comprise at least about 1% builder, preferably from about 5%, more preferably from about 10% to about 80%, preferably to about 50%, more preferably to about 30% by weight, of detergent builder.<br>
The level of builder can vary widely depending upon the end use of the composition and its desired physical form. When present, the compositions will typically comprise at least about 1% builder. Formulations typically comprise from about 5% to about 50%, more typically about 5% to about 30%, by weight, of detergent builder. Granular formulations typically comprise from about 10% to about 80%, more typically from about 15% to about 50% by weight, of the detergent builder. Lower or higher levels of builder, however, are not meant to be excluded.<br>
Inorganic or P-containing detergent builders include, but are not limited to, the alkali metal, ammonium and alkanolammonium salts of polyphosphates (exemplified by the tripolyphosphates, pyrophosphates, and glassy polymeric meta-phosphates), phosphonates, phytic acid, silicates, carbonates (including bicarbonates and sesquicarbonates), sulphates, and aluminosilicates. However, non-phosphate builders are required in some locales. Importantly, the compositions herein function surprisingly well even in the presence of the so-called "weak"<br>
builders (as compared with phosphates) such as citrate, or in the so-called "underbuilt" situation that may occur with zeolite or layered silicate builders.<br>
Examples of silicate builders are the alkali metal silicates, particularly those having a SiO2:Na2O ratio in the range 1.6:1 to 3.2:1 and layered silicates, such as the layered sodium silicates described in U.S. 4,664,839 Rieck, issued May 12, 1987. NaSKS-6 is the trademark for a crystalline layered silicate marketed by Hoechst (commonly abbreviated herein as "SKS-6"). Unlike zeolite builders, the Na SKS-6 silicate builder does not contain aluminum. NaSKS-6 has the delta-Na2SiC&gt;5 morphology form of layered silicate. It can be prepared by methods such as those described in German DE-A-3,417,649 and DE-A-3,742,043. SKS-6 is a highly preferred layered silicate for use herein, but other such layered silicates, such as those having the general formula NaMSixO2x+] -yH2O wherein M is sodium or hydrogen, x is a number from 1.9 to 4, preferably 2, and y is a number from 0 to 20, preferably 0 can be used herein. Various other layered silicates from Hoechst include NaSKS-5, NaSKS-7 and NaSKS-11, as the alpha, beta and gamma forms. As noted above, the delta-Na2SiO5 (NaSKS-6 form) is most preferred for use herein. Other silicates may also be useful such as for example magnesium silicate, which can serve as a crispening agent in granular formulations, as a stabilizing agent for oxygen bleaches, and as a component of suds control systems.<br>
Examples of carbonate builders are the alkaline earth and alkali metal carbonates as disclosed in German Patent Application No. 2,321,001 published on November 15,1973.<br>
Aluminosilicate builders are useful in the present invention. Aluminosilicate builders are of great importance in most currently marketed heavy duty granular detergent compositions, and can also be a significant builder ingredient in liquid detergent formulations. Aluminosilicate builders include those having the empirical formula:<br>
[Mz(zA102)y]xH20 wherein z and y are integers of at least 6, the molar ratio of z to y is in the range from 1.0 to about 0.5, and x is an integer from about 15 to about 264.<br>
Useful aluminosilicate ion exchange materials are commercially available. These aluminosilicates can be crystalline or amorphous in structure and can be naturally-occurring aluminosilicates or synthetically derived. A method for producing aluminosilicate ion exchange materials is disclosed in U.S. 3,985,669, Krummel et al, issued October 12, 1976. Preferred synthetic crystalline aluminosilicate ion exchange materials useful herein are available under the designations Zeolite A, Zeolite P (B), Zeolite MAP and Zeolite X. In an especially preferred embodiment, the crystalline aluminosilicate ion exchange material has the formula:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein x is from about 20 to about 30, especially about 27. This material is known as Zeolite A. Dehydrated zeolites (x = 0 - 10) may also be used herein. Preferably, the aluminosilicate has a particle size of about 0.1-10 microns in diameter.<br>
Organic detergent builders suitable for the purposes of the present invention include, but are not restricted to, a wide variety of polycarboxylate compounds. As used herein, "poly-carboxylate" refers to compounds having a plurality of carboxylate groups, preferably at least 3 carboxylates. Polycarboxylate builder can generally be added to the composition in acid form, but can also be added in the form of a neutralized salt. When utilized in salt form, alkali metals, such as sodium, potassium, and lithium, or alkanolammonium salts are preferred.<br>
Included among the polycarboxylate builders are a variety of categories of useful materials. One important category of polycarboxylate builders encompasses the ether polycarboxylates, including oxydisuccinate, as disclosed in U.S. 3,128,287 Berg, issued April 7, 1964, and U.S. 3,635,830 Lamberti et al., issued January 18, 1972. See also "TMS/TDS" builders of U.S. 4,663,071 Bush et al., issued May 5, 1987. Suitable ether polycarboxylates also include cyclic compounds, particularly alicyclic compounds, such as those described in U.S. 3,923,679 Rapko, issued December 2, 1975; U.S. 4,158,635 Crutchfield et al., issued June 19, 1979; U.S. 4,120,874 Crutchfield et al., issued October 17, 1978; and U.S. 4,102,903 Crutchfield et al., issued July 25, 1978.<br>
Other useful detergency builders include the ether hydroxypolycarboxylates, copolymers of maleic anhydride with ethylene or vinyl methyl ether, 1, 3, 5-trihydroxy benzene-2, 4, 6-trisulphonic acid, and carboxymethyloxysuccinic acid, the various alkali metal, ammonium and substituted ammonium salts of polyacetic acids such as ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid and nitrilotriacetic acid, as well as polycarboxylates such as mellitic acid, succinic acid, oxydisuccinic acid, polymaleic acid, benzene 1,3,5-tricarboxylic acid, carboxymethyloxysuccinic acid, and soluble salts thereof.<br>
Citrate builders, e.g., citric acid and soluble salts thereof (particularly sodium salt), are polycarboxylate builders of particular importance for heavy duty liquid detergent formulations due to their availability from renewable resources and their biodegradability. Citrates can also be used in granular compositions, especially in combination with zeolite and/or layered silicate builders. Oxydisuccinates are also especially useful in such compositions and combinations.<br>
Also suitable in the detergent compositions of the present invention are the 3,3-dicar-boxy-4-oxa-l,6-hexanedioates and the related compounds disclosed in U.S. 4,566,984, Bush, issued January 28, 1986. Useful succinic acid builders include the C5-C20 alkyl and alkenyl succinic acids and salts thereof. A particularly preferred compound of this type is do-<br>
decenylsuccinic acid. Specific examples of succinate builders include: laurylsuccinate, myristylsuccinate, palmitylsuccinate, 2-dodecenylsuccinate (preferred), 2-pentadecenylsuccinate, and the like. Laurylsuccinates are the preferred builders of this group, and are described in European Patent Application 86200690.5/0,200,263, published November 5, 1986.<br>
Other suitable polycarboxylates are disclosed in U.S. 4,144,226, Crutchfield et al., issued March 13, 1979 and in U.S. 3,308,067, Diehl, issued March 7, 1967. See also Diehl U.S. Patent 3,723,322.<br>
Fatty acids, e.g., C^-Cjg monocarboxylic acids, can also be incorporated into the compositions alone, or in combination with the aforesaid builders, especially citrate and/or the succinate builders, to provide additional builder activity. Such use of fatty acids will generally result in a diminution of sudsing, which should be taken into account by the formulator.<br>
In situations where phosphorus-based builders can be used, and especially in the formulation of bars used for hand-laundering operations, the various alkali metal phosphates such as the well-known sodium tripolyphosphates, sodium pyrophosphate and sodium orthophosphate can be used. Phosphonate builders such as ethane-1-hydroxy-1,1-diphosphonate and other known phosphonates (see, for example, U.S. Patents 3,159,581; 3,213,030; 3,422,021; 3,400,148 and 3,422,137) can also be used. Dispersants<br>
A description of other suitable polyalkyleneimine dispersants which may be optionally combined with the bleach stable dispersants of the present invention can be found in U.S. 4,597,898 Vander Meer, issued July 1, 1986; European Patent Application 111,965 Oh and Gosselink, published June 27, 1984; European Patent Application 111,984 Gosselink, published June 27,1984; European Patent Application 112,592 Gosselink, published July 4, 1984; U.S. 4,548,744 Connor, issued October 22, 1985; and U.S. 5,565,145 Watson et al., issued October 15, 1996; all of which are included herein by reference. However, any suitable clay/soil dispersant or anti-redepostion agent can be used in the laundry compositions of the present invention.<br>
In addition, polymeric dispersing agents which include polymeric polycarboxylates and polyethylene glycols, are suitable for use in the present invention. Polymeric polycarboxylate materials can be prepared by polymerizing or copolymerizing suitable unsaturated monomers, preferably in their acid form. Unsaturated monomelic acids that can be polymerized to form suitable polymeric polycarboxylates include acrylic acid, maleic acid (or maleic anhydride), fumaric acid, itaconic acid, aconitic acid, mesaconic acid, citraconic acid and methylenemalonic acid. The presence in the polymeric polycarboxylates herein or monomelic segments, containing<br>
no carboxylate radicals such as vinylmethyl ether, styrene, ethylene, etc. is suitable provided mat such segments do not constitute more than about 40% by weight.<br>
Particularly suitable polymeric polycarboxylates can be derived from acrylic acid. Such acrylic acid-based polymers which are useful herein are the water-soluble salts of polymerized acrylic acid. The average molecular weight of such polymers in the acid form preferably ranges from about 2,000 to 10,000, more preferably from about 4,000 to 7,000 and most preferably from about 4,000 to 5,000. Water-soluble salts of such acrylic acid polymers can include, for example, the alkali metal, ammonium and substituted ammonium salts. Soluble polymers of this type are known materials. Use of polyacrylates of this type in detergent compositions has been disclosed, for example, in U.S. 3,308,067 Diehl, issued March 7, 1967.<br>
Acrylic/maleic-based copolymers may also be used as a preferred component of the dispersing/anti-redeposition agent. Such materials include the water-soluble salts of copolymers of acrylic acid and maleic acid. The average molecular weight of such copolymers in the acid form preferably ranges from about 2,000, preferably from about 5,000, more preferably from about 7,000 to 100,000, more preferably to 75,000, most preferably to 65,000. The ratio of acrylate to maleate segments in such copolymers will generally range from about 30:1 to about 1:1, more preferably from about 10:1 to 2:1. Water-soluble salts of such acrylic acid/maleic acid copolymers can include, for example, the alkali metal, ammonium and substituted ammonium salts. Soluble acrylate/maleate copolymers of this type are known materials which are described in European Patent Application No. 66915, published December 15, 1982, as well as in EP 193,360, published September 3, 1986, which also describes such polymers comprising hydroxypropylacrylate. Still other useful dispersing agents include the maleic/acrylic/vinyl alcohol terpolymers. Such materials are also disclosed in EP 193,360, including, for example, the 45/45/10 terpolymer of acrylic/maleic/vinyl alcohol.<br>
Another polymeric material which can be included is polyethylene glycol (PEG). PEG can exhibit dispersing agent performance as well as act as a clay soil removal-antiredeposition agent. Typical molecular weight ranges for these purposes range from about 500 to about 100,000, preferably from about 1,000 to about 50,000, more preferably from about 1,500 to about 10,000.<br>
Polyaspartate and polyglutamate dispersing agents may also be used, especially in conjunction with zeolite builders. Dispersing agents such as polyaspartate preferably have a molecular weight (avg.) of about 10,000.<br>
Soil Release Agents<br>
The compositions according to the present invention may optionally comprise one or more soil release agents. If utilized, soil release agents will generally comprise from about 0.01%, preferably from about 0.1 %, more preferably from about 0.2% to about 10%, preferably to about 5%, more preferably to about 3% by weight, of the composition. Polymeric soil release agents are characterized by having both hydrophilic segments, to hydrophilize the surface of hydrophobic fibers, such as polyester and nylon, and hydrophobic segments, to deposit upon hydrophobic fibers and remain adhered thereto through completion of the laundry cycle and, thus, serve as an anchor for the hydrophilic segments. This can enable stains occuring subsequent to treatment with the soil release agent to be more easily cleaned in later washing procedures.<br>

EXAMPLE 1<br>
Synthesis of ethoxvlated (E20) bis(hexamethvlene)triamine<br>
tribenzvl quaternary ammonium bromide<br>
Ethoxylation of Bis(hexamethy!ene)triamine to Average E20 per NH - The ethoxylation<br>
is conducted in a 2 gallon stirred stainless steel autoclave equipped for temperature measurement<br>
and control, pressure measurement, vacuum and inert gas purging, sampling, and for introduction<br>
of ethylene oxide as a liquid. A -20 lb. net cylinder of ethylene oxide (ARC) is set up to deliver<br>
ethylene oxide as a liquid by a pump to the autoclave with the cylinder placed on a scale so that<br>
the weight change of the cylinder could be monitored.<br>
A 362 g portion of Bis(hexamethylene)triamine (BHMT) (m.w. 215, (Aldrich), 1.68<br>
moles, 5.04 moles nitrogen, 8.4 moles ethoxylatable (NH) sites, is added to the autoclave. The<br>
autoclave is then sealed and purged of air (by applying vacuum to minus 28" Hg followed by<br>
pressurization with nitrogen to 250 psia, then venting to atmospheric pressure). The autoclave<br>
contents are heated to 80 OC while applying vacuum. After about one hour, the autoclave is<br>
charged with nitrogen to about 250 psia while cooling the autoclave to about 105 °C. Ethylene<br>
oxide is then added to the autoclave incrementally over time while closely monitoring the<br>
autoclave pressure, temperature, and ethylene oxide flow rate. The ethylene oxide pump is turned<br>
off and cooling is applied to limit any temperature increase resulting from any reaction exotherm.<br>
The temperature is maintained between 100 and 110 °C while the total pressure is allowed to<br>
gradually increase during the course of the reaction. After a total of 370 grams of ethylene oxide<br>
(8.4 moles) has been charged to the autoclave, the temperature is increased to 110 °C and the<br>
autoclave is allowed to stir for an additional 2 hours. At this point, vacuum is applied to remove<br>
any residual unreacted ethylene oxide.<br>
Next, vacuum is continuously applied while the autoclave is cooled to about 50 °C while<br>
introducing 181.5 g of a 25% sodium methoxide in methanol solution (0.84 moles, to achieve a<br>
10% catalyst loading based upon ethoxylatable sites functions). The methoxide solution is<br>
removed from the autoclave under vacuum and then the autoclave temperature controller setpoint<br>
is increased to 100 °C. A device is used to monitor the power consumed by the agitator. The<br>
agitator power is monitored along with the temperature and pressure. Agitator power and<br>
temperature values gradually increase as methanol is removed from the autoclave and the<br>
viscosity of the mixture increases and stabilizes in about 1.5 hours indicating that most of the methanol has been removed. The mixture is further heated and agitated under vacuum for an additional 30 minutes.<br>
Vacuum is removed and the autoclave is cooled to 105 °C while it is being charged with nitrogen to 250 psia and then vented to ambient pressure. The autoclave is charged to 200 psia with nitrogen. Ethylene oxide is again added to the autoclave incrementally as before while closely monitoring the autoclave pressure, temperature, and ethylene oxide flow rate while maintaining the temperature between 100 and 110 °C and limiting any temperature increases due to reaction exptherm. After the addition of 4180 g of ethylene oxide (95 mol, resulting in a total of 20 moles of ethylene oxide per mole of ethoxylatable sites on BHMT), the temperature is increased to 110 °C and the mixture stirred for an additional 2 hours.<br>
The reaction mixture is then collected into a 22 L three neck round bottomed flask purged with nitrogen. The strong alkali calalyst is neutralized by slow addition of 80.7 g methanesulfonic acid (0.84 moles) with heating (100 °C) and mechanical stirring. The reaction mixture is then removed of residual ethylene oxide and deodorized by sparging an inert gas (argon or nitrogen) into the mixture through a gas dispersion frit while agitating and heating the mixture to 120 °C for 1 hour. The final reaction product is cooled slightly and stored in a glass container purged with nitrogen.<br>
Quaternization of BHMT E20 to 90 mol% (3 mol N per mol polymer) - Into a weighed, 1000ml, 3 neck round bottom flask fitted with argon inlet, condenser, addition funnel, thermometer, mechanical stirring and argon outlet (connected to a bubbler) is added BHMT EO20 (522.8g, 0.333 mol N, 98% active, m.w.-4615) under argon. The material is heated to 80°C with stirring until melted. Next, benzyl bromide (61.6g, 0.36mol, Aldrich, m.w.-171.04) is slowly added to the melted BHMT EO20 using an addition funnel over a period of 10 minutes. The reaction complete after stirring at 80°C for 6 hours. The reaction mixture is dissolved in 500g water and adjusted to pH&gt;7 using 1N NaOH followed by transfer to a plastic container for storage.<br>
