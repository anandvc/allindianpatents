AUTOMATIC CLUTCH WITH MANUAL OVERRIDE CONTROL MECHANISM<br>
Background and Field of Invention This invention relates to automatic clutches adapted for use with a motive power source, and more particularly relates to a novel and improved automatic centrifugal clutch with a manual override control mechanism for  motorcvcles<br>
Motorcvcles emolov internal combustion engines either of the two-stroke or four-stroke variety, the fuelbeing ignited by an electric starter to cause the pistons to advance through their respective cylinders and to turn the engine crankshaft via a connecting rod which joins the piston and crankshaft together. The crankshaft converts the up and down movement of the piston to a circular motion which operates through a gear, or chain reduction to power a pinion into the primary drive gear on a clutch housing. This permits the rider to disconnect the engine from the transmission in order to shift from one gear to another. The clutch itself is operated by a hand lever so as to allow power to be fed gradually from the engine to the gearing or to be disconnected for gear changing. Also, in the standard motorcycle, a gear shift is controlled by a foot lever to engage or disengage the transmission depending upon whether one wants to idle or cause the gears to impart rotation of the crankshaft into the rear wheel. In most street bikes an electric starter is employed, and in emergency situations it is possible to bumpstart by running alongside the motorcycle with the manual clutch pulled in and transmission in the lowest gear<br><br>
2<br>
that won't lock up the rear wheel, then hop on and pop the clutch as one hits the seat.<br>
In off-road motorcycles, referred to as "trail" or "dirt" bikes customarily there is no electric starter to start the engine; instead, a kickstart foot lever operates through a primary gear on the clutch housing to rotate the crankshaft and start the engine very much like the hand crank employed . in early model automobiles. When used in conjunction with an automatic clutch the kickstart lever imparts rotation directly to the outer basket or housing portion of the clutch via idler gears in a crankshaft set to the engine. Previously, at least in the automatic clutch versions, it was not possible to bumpstart by popping or manually engaging the clutch after getting up to speed.<br>
It has been proposed in the past to utilize a central push rod in the clutch housing which when activated will release the friction plates in the clutch against spring pressure, representative patents being U.S. Patent Nos. 4,51_8,_070, 3,842,954 and 3,215,234. Nevertheless, no practical way has been devised previously to mechanically engage the automatic clutch for purposes of bumpstarting it in emergency situations. Therefore, it is desirable to provide a simple but highly effective means of manually engaging an automatic clutch through the utilization of the existing clutch mechanism and specifically to employ a push rod in the reverse manner to cause the clutch plates to engage by forcing a series of rolling members out along an inclined surface or ramp to overcome the spring pressure normally  retaining  the  clutch  plates  out  of<br><br>
3<br>
engagement. In this way, it is possible to bumpstart the engine by engaging the transmission gears, rolling the motorcycle along the ground to reverse the transmission from the rear wheel into the transmission shaft centrally of the clutch housing, followed by activating the push rod to engage the clutch and rotate the crankshaft through the primary driven gear in the clutch housing. Moreover, the automatic clutch will be normally disengaged at lower rpms or when the engine is idling and therefore not require manual disengagement each time that the motorcycle is slowed down or stopped.<br>
In bumpstarting, it is important to understand that the initial turning or rotational movement required for rotation of the transmission shaft must be imparted by rotation of the rear wheel back through the gear reduction drive into the transmission shaft and which can be done simply by rolling or advancing the motorcycle along the ground. Secondly, it is necessary to shift the gearing from neutral into one of the gear positions, such as, second gear whereupon activation of the push rod to engage the clutch will impart rotation to the crankshaft and start the engine without the kickstarter.<br>
Accordingly, there is a need for an emergency starting mechanism for automatic clutch type motorcycles and other applications as well but particularly for use in off-road vehicles which can employ the existing drive train of the motorcycle and impart the necessary turning force to start the engine without the assistance of a kickstarter or electric starter. Moreover in standard motorcycles there is a<br><br>
4<br>
need for a clutch lockout so as to make automatic clutches feasible for use with electric starters. Summary of the Invention<br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide for a novel and improved method and means for bumpstarting an internal combustion engine which is highly dependable and effective in use while requiring a minimum of manual exertion or effort.<br>
It is another object of the invention to provide for a push rod in combination with a centrifugal clutch which is capable of selectively engaging the clutch plates of an automatic clutch without imparting any centrifugal force to the clutch-engaging members <br>
It is a further object of the present invention to provide for a novel and improved clutch-engaging mechanism which requires minimal movement of an activating member to effect engagement of the clutch plates of an automatic clutch and wherein the starting mechanism is conformable for use with different types of existing automatic clutch mechanisms.<br>
It is a still further object of the present invention to provide a manual control for an automatic motorcycle clutch, either in the form of a pusn rod or pull rod, which enables the clutch to remain in a normally released position when at low speeds or idling and can effect manual clutch for bumpstarting.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, there has been devised a novel and improved manual control mechanism for an automatic clutch interposed between an engine crankshaft and a transmission shaft<br><br>
5<br>
wherein the clutch is provided with an inner hub coupled to the transmission shaft and an outer cover coupled to the crankshaft with clutch members alternately extending from and fixed for rotation with said hub and said cover portion and being axially displaceable into and away from frictional engagement with one another, a clutch-engaging member at one end of the clutch members including spring means biasing said pressure plate away from the clutch members, and centrifugal force-responsive means movable radially and outwardly along said pressure plate to overcome the spring means and force the pressure plate axially against an endmost of the clutch members whereby to impart rotation between the basket and the hub, the mechanism comprising control member actuating means between one end of the control member and clutch-engaging member being movable in response to axial movement of the control member to displace the clutch-engaging member in an axial direction independently of the spring means, and manual control means for selectively advancing and retracting the control member in an axial direction whereby to manually control engagement and release of the clutch members independently of the speed of rotation of the clutch housing.<br>
In a preferred form of invention, the manual control member is a push rod or pull rod for selectively engaging the clutch members by forcing the clutch-engaging member to overcome spring pressure and compress the clutch plates into firm frictional engagement so that the transmission shaft rotation is imparted to the crankshaft through the clutch housing. The clutch-engaging member may either take the form of<br><br><br>
6<br>
a pressure plate within the clutch housing or the clutch housing itself in manually engaging the clutch to bumpstart the cycle.<br>
In other modified forms of invention the push rod or control rod is employed in an automatic clutch to mechanically lock the clutch in a neutral position so that the clutch cannot be engaged without manually releasing the control rod; otherwise, when the control rod is depressed it will prevent the pressure plate from engaging the clutch plates and the clutch remains disengaged even when the engine reaches a speed that would normally cause the clutch to engage. If desired, a dual control mechanism may be utilized to releasably lock the clutch in a neutral position or to manually engage the clutch for . bumpstarting the cycle.<br>
There has been outlined, rather broadly, the more important features of the invention in order that the detailed description thereof that follows may be better understood, and in order that the present contribution to the art may be better appreciated. There are, of course, additional features of the invention that will be described hereinafter, will<br>

There is shown by way of illustrative example in Figure 1 the mounting of a preferred form of automatic clutch assembly 10 in the drive train of an off-road motorcycle wherein a crankshaft set 12 from the engine piston 14 imparts rotation to the power input side of the clutch 10 through a pinion 16 into primary drive gear 18 on clutch housing 17.  A<br><br>
9<br>
transmission shaft 20 is mounted for rotation by the clutch 10 when in the engaged position and through speed reduction gears represented at 22 to rotate the drive sprocket 24 of a chain drive, not shown, into the rear wheel of the bike. In accordance with the present invention, a push rod 2 6 extends through the transmission shaft 20 to manually engage the clutch plates to be hereinafter described for the purpose of bumpstartinq the enqine. The foregoing description of the drive train is intended more as a settinq for the present invention inasmuch as there_are_. numerous types of drive trains for motorcycles with which the push rod of this invention may be utilized<br>
Referring to Figures 2 and 3, the push rod 26 is mounted for slidable movement through the end of the transmission shaft 20, a ball bearing 27 being journaled at a leading end of the rod and inserted in an actuator assembly 28 at the center of the clutch housing 17, and a trailing end 29 extends through a bracket 30 mounted on the end of the transmission shaft 20. The bracket 30 includes a pivotal arm 31 abutting the trailing end 29 of the push rod .26. A free end 33 is connected to a cable control wire 35 which is manually controlled by a hand lever 36 on the handlebar of the bike to advance and retract the push rod 26 with respect to the clutch assembly 10.,<br>
In the preferred form, the clutch assembly 10 is an automatic clutch having individual parts, as illustrated in Figures 4 to 11, including a radially outer series of circumferentially spaced roller members 40 interposed between a pressure plate 42 and a cover 44. The members 40 are responsive to centrifugal force to roll outwardly along radial slots 41 in the pressure<br><br>
10<br>
plate 42 and aligned slots 43 in the cover 44 and to squeeze or compress together a series of radially inner and outer frictional clutch plates 46 and 47, respectively. In accordance with well-known practice, the inner metal plates 46 have inner tabs 76 which are axially slidable in grooves 48 in the outer wall of an inner hub 49, and the transmission shaft 20 is affixed to the inner hub 49 by a lock nut 21. The outer clutch plates 47 have extension tabs 77 which are slidable axially along circumferentially spaced axial grooves 51 on the inner wall of the outer cylindrical basket or housing 17, the latter defining an axial extension of the outer peripheral edge of the cover 44. The clutch plates 46 and 47 are sandwiched between the pressure plate 42 and an end wall 52 of the basket 17; and the pressure plate 42 is normally held away from the plates 46, 47 by a series of compression springs 53 mounted on bolts 54 between the cover 44 and recessed portions 56 in the pressure plate 42. The spring tension is regulated to resist radial outward movement of the roller members 40 and movement of the pressure plate 42 against the plates 46, 47 until the clutch 10 reaches a predetermined rotational speed imparted by the crankshaft 12 through the gear 18 once the engine has been started by the kickstarter lever L. Again, the construction and arrangement of clutch elements as just described is standard and for example is characteristic of the Kawasaki KX500 model clutch manufactured and sold by Kawasaki Motors Corp., U.S.A. of Irvine, California. An important feature of the present invention resides in the actuator assembly 28 at the leading end 27 of the push rod. Preferably, the leading end 27 includes a ball 60 journaled therein and bearing against<br><br><br>
11<br>
complementary bearing surfaces 62 projecting radially and inwardly from the end of an annular slide member 64 mounted in a center bore of the cover 44 and coaxial with and in outer surrounding relation to the push rod 26. An external shoulder 68 on the slide 64 has a tapered surface 67 which bears against a series of metal balls 68, preferably steel or other low-friction material. The balls 68 are movable along radial slots 70 on the inner wall of the cover 44 and aligned slots 73 in a tapered surface 72 of the pressure plate 42 so as to overcome the force of the springs 53 in response to advancement of the push rod 26 forcing the slide 64 forwardly in relation to the cover 44. As best seen from Figures 2 and 3, very slight movement on the order of ,060" is required to displace the clutch-engaging pressure plate 42 the axial distance necessary to compress the clutch plates 46, 47 together and to effect complete clutch engagement. In this way, rotation of the transmission shaft 20 is then transmitted through the primary driven gear 18 on the clutch 10 to the crankshaft 12 in bumpstarting the engine. Once started and up to idling speed, the lever 36 can be released and the outer rollers 40 will have rolled into position maintaining the pressure plate 42 in firm engagement with the clutch plates 46,47.<br>
In practice, the off-road cycles such as the trail or dirt bikes are often kickstarted as earlier described by the foot lever L rotating the kickstart gear 19 at the end wall 52 of the housing and thereby rotates the gears 16, 18 into the crankshaft 12 to start the engine. Once the engine is brought up to speed it will rotate the clutch housing 10 and pressure plate 42 at a high enough speed to force the roller members 40<br><br>
12<br>
outwardly by centrifugal force to compress the clutch plates 46 and 47 into close frictional engagement. In turn, this permits the power produced at the crankshaft 12 to be transmitted through the primary gear 16 to the transmission shaft 20 via suitable linkage, not shown, to the rear wheel which is typically a chain drive to transfer the turning motion of the transmission to the wheel. Bumpstarting in accordance with the present invention achieves the same end result but operates through the selective mechanical engagement of the clutch plates 46, 47 to rotate the crankshaft via the clutch housing after the desired transmission gear ratio is selected and the motorcycle rolled along the ground to reverse the transmission and rotate the inner hub 48 of the clutch 10.<br>
Detailed Description of Modified Forms of Invention<br>
A modified form of invention is illustrated in Figures 12 and 13 wherein like parts to those of the preferred form are correspondingly enumerated with prime numerals. The modified form is intended for use as a safety device to mechanically lock the clutch in neutral position so that the motorcycle or other vehicle cannot advance or take off until the push rod 26' is positively released by releasing the lever 36*.<br>
Even then, it is necessary for the engine to rotate the clutch at a speed which will enable the outer rollers 40' to force the clutch plates 46', 47' into engagement. A notable distinction in the actuating mechanism is that the slide 80 has an external shoulder 81 with little or no taper and is designed to move directly into engagement with a flat end surface 82 of an inner radial portion of the pressure plate 86 thereby to force the<br><br>
13<br>
pressure plate 86 away from engagement with the clutch plates 46', 47 ' when the lever 36' is depressed, as shown in Figure 13. When the control lever 36' is released, as shown in Figure 12, the pressure plate 86 will compress the clutch plates 46', 47' under the urging of the rollers 40' only when the engine gets up to speed to a sufficient extent to force the rollers 40' outwardly and overcome the force of the springs 53'. The modified form as herein described enables the use of an automatic clutch on a bike which employs an electric starter and can be bumpstarted in the conventional manner. The automatic clutch is of course substituted for the stock or manual clutch typically employed in a bike and accordingly the existing clutch lever on the handlebar can serve as the release lever 36' for the push rod 20 '.<br>
While the preferred and modified forms of inventions have been described in connection with motorcycles it will be evident that they are conformable for use in various other applications which employ a motive power source, such as, an electric motor or internal combustion engine including but not limited to other vehicles, such as, drag "racing, cars, trucks, tractors, go-carts, cement mixers and all-terrain vehicles, and power tools including chain saws and weed-eaters and virtually any application in which an automatic clutch can be utilized. furthermore, as illustrated in Figure 1, multiple rows of balls as designated at 40a and 40b may be employed in outer races between the pressure plate 42 and cover 44; and as indicated earlier the roller members 40 of Figures 2 and 3 either may be cylindrical or spherical.<br>
Still another modified form of invention  is<br><br>
14<br>
shown in Figure 14 comprising a dual control mechanism having an inner concentric push rod 86 slidable through outer concentric push rod 88, both push rods 86 and 88 being slidable centrally of transmission shaft 20'_of an automatic clutch 10'. The push rod 86,is made up of a solid rod portion projecting through the greater length of the tubular rod 88 and has a rod-like end portion 89 projecting through the end of the tubular portion 88 as well as the transmission shaft 20 for engagement by a pivotal arm 90. The arm 90 is manually controlled through a cable control wire 91 by a hand lever 92-in the same manner as described with reference to the control lever 36 of Figures 2 and 3. The opposite end of the push rod 86 has an enlarged end 92 and a ball bearing 93 journaled on the leading end 92 and inserted in actuator assembly 28'.<br>
The outer concentric member 88 is of elongated tubular construction having a reduced tubular end portion 94 at its trailing end and has a leading end projecting through the leading end of the transmission shaft 20' to terminate in an enlarged, disk-shaped portion 95 between the end of the transmission shaft 20' and the actuator assembly 28. A pivotal arm 96 is connected to a cable control wire 97 from a hand lever 98. The pivotal arm 96 is bifurcated so as to straddle the arm 90 and bear against the trailing end of the tubular portion 94. As in the modified form of Figures 12 and 13, when the tubular control member 88 is axially advanced through the transmission shaft 20' by depression of the control lever 98, it will cause the end portion 95 to engage flat end surface 82' of the pressure plate 84 to mechanically lock the pressure plate  84'  in  neutral  position  as  described  with<br><br>
15<br>
reference to Figures 12 and 13. Once again, as in the preferred form of Figures 1 to 3, the engine can be bumpstarted by depressing the control lever 92 to advance the push rod 86 and cause the pressure plate 84' to compress the clutch plates 46' and 47' into engagement with one another in bumpstarting the engine. It is important to recognize that only one of the control levers 92 and 98 can be depressed depending upon whether it is desired to lock the clutch in a neutral position or to bumpstart the engine. For this reason, the dual control mechanism would have principal utility in off-road motorcycles having electric starters or in racing bikes in which the clutch must remain disengaged even when the engine rpm exceeds that normally required to cause automatic clutch engagement.<br>
Figures 15 to 18 illustrate still another modified form of invention for an automatic clutch '_Ui having a standard transmission shaft 120 and where from space considerations it . is necessary or at least desirable to mount the bumpstart control mechanism at the opposite end of the clutch housing to that of Figures 1 to 3, For this purpose, the control mechanism is mounted in a cup-shaped end 100. of a cover plate 101 at the end of the clutch opposite to the transmission shaft 120. The control mechanism is broadly comprised _ of a pull rod 102 mounted at one end in a bearing 103 in an actuator sleeve 128 in the end plate i44_ of the clutch. The actuator 128 has a beveled shoulder 167, and a series of balls 168 are movable along radial slots on the inner wall of the end plate 144 as well as aligned slots in a tapered surface of the pressure plate 142 - Accordingly, as in the preferred form of Figures 1 to 3, when the slide member 128 is urged in a<br><br>
16<br>
direction toward the cover 101 the balls 168 will be forced in an outward radial direction, overcoming the force of the springs 153 to cause the pressure plate 142 to compress the clutch plates 14 6 and 147 together to complete manual engagement of the clutch.<br>
The forward or leading end of the pull rod 102 has an external flange or shoulder 104 to interengage with the notched portion" 105 in a cam 106 on a control arm 107. As best seen from Figures 16 and 18, the control arm 107 is mounted at the end of a shaft 108 which is journaled within the cuD-shaoed recess 100. and a control cable 135 extends from a hand control lever 136 on the handlebar of the cycle to control axial movement of the pull rod 102. Thus, in the released position shown in Figure ( 15, the balls are normally forced" to a radial inward position by the spring elements 153. When the lever 136 is manually depressed, the cable 135 will rotate the control arm 107 causing the notched portion 105 of the cam 106 to bear against the shoulder 104 and cause the pull rod 102 to be axially displaced along with the slide member ..128 thereby forcing the balls 168 radially outwardly to compress the pressure plate 142 against the plates 146 and 147 as earlier described.<br>
Although the different forms of invention shown in Figures 1 to 18 illustrate the bumpstart and other control levers as being mounted on the handlebar, it will be apparent that the control levers can be mounted at different locations within reach of the operator, such as, a pushbutton on the dashboard or a foot control lever. A particular advantage of the present invention is the ability to eliminate the clutch control lever which in the conventional motorcycle is<br><br>
17<br>
placed on the lefthand of the handlebar H. For example, Figure 19 illustrates a conventional control system for a bike with standard clutch and which includes a clutch control lever L-l and compression lever L-2 on the left hand. A front brake control lever R-2, throttle R-2 and electric starter R-3 are on the right hand. A gear shift control LF-1 is on the left foot and rear brake control RF-1 is on the right foot.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, Figure 20 illustrates a motorcycle with electric starter and automatic clutch with the same foot controls as in Figure 19 as well as the right hand controls. However, in place of the clutch control lever illustrated in Figure 19, various controls may be positioned on the left hand of the handlebar H' including rear brake L-l, compression release L-2, gear shift L-3, bumpstart L-4 and neutral start L-5. For example, the rear brake control L-l may be placed on the left hand grip of the handlebar along with the bumpstart lever L-4, since the bumpstart lever is activated only in starting and not in slowing down when the brake or brakes would be applied. Accordingly, it is possible to control both the front and rear brakes by hand control which is most desirable in racing so as to leave the feet free for guiding or balance. Thus, in the absence of the clutch control lever on the handlebar, one or more of the hand control levers L-i to L-5 on the left nand or right hand of the handlebar H' are individually controlled.<br>
It is therefore to be understood that while preferred and modified forms of invention have been herein set forth and described the above and other modifications and changes may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention as<br><br>
