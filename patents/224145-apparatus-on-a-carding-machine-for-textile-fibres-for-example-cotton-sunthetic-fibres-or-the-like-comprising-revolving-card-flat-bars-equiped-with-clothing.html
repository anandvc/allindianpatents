				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>Apparatus on a carding machine for textile fibres,<br>
for example, cotton, synthetic fibres or the like,<br>
comprising revolving card flat bars equipped with<br>
clothing.<br>
The invention relates to an apparatus on a<br>
carding machine for textile fibres, for example,<br>
cotton, synthetic fibres and the like, comprising<br>
revolving card flat bars equipped with clothing,<br>
in which a space is present between the tips of<br>
the card flat clothings and the tips of the<br>
cylinder clothing and the card flat clothings form<br>
an adjustable angle with the cylinder clothing,<br>
wherein the ends of the card flat bars each slide<br>
with one part on a first curved slideway and with<br>
another part on a second curved slideway and the<br>
sliding-contact surfaces of the slideways - viewed<br>
circumferentially - have different distances from<br>
one another.<br>
In a known apparatus (WO 00/05441), an<br>
adjusting device for the local displacement of the<br>
flexible second slideway is arranged centrally.<br>
On operation thereof, the second slideway is moved<br>
outwards or inwards in a radial direction with<br>
respect to the cylinder. The adjusting device<br>
includes a plurality of support members, which<br>
extend from a central support member and support<br>
the second curved slide such that the radial<br>
support members extend or contract in response to<br>
the position of the adjusting device. The<br>
adjusting device can operate hydraulically or<br>
pneumatically. The second guide means can be<br>
arranged in the operating region of the cylinder<br>
substantially parallel to the cylinder surface;<br>
alternatively, its relative position may vary<br>
around the working surface of the cylinder, in<br>
order to change the angle of inclination of the<br>
card flats as they traverse the working region of<br>
the cylinder and hence to influence the quality of<br>
carding obtained. It is not necessary to adjust<br>
each card flat bar individually; all that is<br>
required is a single adjustment of the position of<br>
the guide means with respect to the carding<br>
machine in order to set the angle of inclination<br>
of all card flat bars in the flat driving chain.<br>
The high structural complexity required for<br>
displacing and adjusting the card flat bars is a<br>
disadvantage. The known apparatus is costly in<br>
terms of equipment. It is a further disadvantage<br>
that the support members are only in point-contact<br>
engagement with the second slideway. In<br>
particular, it is inconvenient that the angles of<br>
inclination of all the card flat bars at any one<br>
time are adjustable. In this way, either all<br>
angles of inclination can only be increased or all<br>
anngles of inclination can only be decreased. This<br>
uniform alignment of the card flat bars, or<br>
rather, of the card flat bar clothings, leads to<br>
increased damage to the fibres and to nep<br>
formation. Finally, the clothings of the card<br>
flat bars are subject to considerable wear during<br>
operation.<br>
The invention is therefore based on the<br>
problem of producing an apparatus of the kind<br>
described in the introduction, which avoids the<br>
said disadvantages, which in particular is of<br>
simple construction and is easy to assemble,<br>
enables the carding intensity of the card flat<br>
bars to be individually adjusted and allows wear<br>
of the clothing on the card flat bars to be<br>
reduced.<br>
That problem is solved by the characterising<br>
features of claim 1.<br>
The features according to the invention permit<br>
the angle between the clothing surface of each<br>
card flat bar and the cylinder clothing - the so-<br>
called offset angle - to be individually selected.-<br>
A special advantage comprises the fact that by<br>
specific or individual alignment of the clothing<br>
surfaces of the card flat bars in relation to one<br>
another, the ratio of fibre damage to nep<br>
formation is quite considerably improved. Added<br>
to this is that the fact that the lasting<br>
technological improvement is rendered possible in<br>
a structurally especially simple way. The<br>
arrangement of the slideways enables additional<br>
devices for displacing the card flat bars and the<br>
slideways to be omitted. The individual<br>
adjustment of the angle of inclination is effected<br>
automatically by virtue of the fact that the<br>
sliding elements of the card flat bars slide on<br>
two sliding-contact surfaces, the mutual spacings<br>
of<br>
which both increase and decrease. In accordance<br>
with a further advantage, the individual<br>
inclination of the carding surfaces considerably<br>
reduces wear of the clothing on the card flat<br>
bars .<br>

clothing and 4b denotes the direction of rotation<br>
of the cylinder 4. The letter C denotes the<br>
direction of rotation in the carding setting and<br>
the letter D the return transport direction of the<br>
card flat assembly.<br>
Referring to Fig. 2, on each side of the<br>
carding machine, a flexible bend 17 having several<br>
adjusting screws is secured by means of screws<br>
laterally to the machine frame. The flexible bend<br>
17 has a convex outer surfacel7a and a lower<br>
surface 17b. Above the flexible bend 17, there is<br>
a first slideway 20, for example, of anti-friction<br>
plastics material, which has a convex outer<br>
surface 20a and a concave inner surface 20b. The<br>
second slideway 21 (see Figs 3a, 3b, 4a, 4b) is<br>
not shown. The concave inner surface 20b lies on<br>
the convex outer surface 17a. The card flat bars<br>
14 have at both ends a respective card flat heel<br>
part 14a, secured to which in the axial direction<br>
are two steel pins 14b that slide on the convex<br>
outer surface 20 of the slideway 20 in the<br>
direction of arrow C. The card flat clothing 14d<br>
is mounted on the lower surface of the carrier<br>
element 14c. The reference number 23 denotes the<br>
tip circle of the card flat clothings 14d. On its<br>
circumference, the cylinder 4 has a cylinder<br>
clothing 4a, for example, saw-tooth clothing. The<br>
reference numeral 22 denotes the tip circle of the<br>
cylinder clothing 4a. The distance between the tip<br>
circle 23 and the tip circle 22 is denoted by the<br>
letter a, and is, for example, 2/1000". The<br>
distance between the convex outer surface 20a and<br>
the tip circle 22 is denoted by the letter b. The<br>
variable radius of the convex outer surface 20a is<br>
denoted by r1 and the constant radius of the tip<br>
circle 22 is denoted by r2. The radius r2<br>
intersects the mid-point M (see Fig. 1) of the<br>
cylinder 4. The reference numeral 14c denotes the<br>
card flat back.<br>
Figs 3a and 3b show (to an exaggerated degree<br>
in the drawing) the changes in the angle a and b<br>
respectively subtended between the card flat<br>
clothings 18a, 18b, 18c and the tangent to the<br>
cylinder clothing 4a. According to Fig. 3a, the<br>
pins 14b1, 14b3 and 14b5 lie on the sliding contact<br>
surface 21a of the first slideway 21 and the pins<br>
14b2, 14b4 and 14b6 lie on the sliding contact<br>
surface 20a on the second slideway 20. The<br>
sliding contact surface 20a, partly visible in<br>
side view, is drawn with a dash-dot line and the<br>
visible sliding contact surface 21a is drawn with<br>
a continuous line. The distance between the tip<br>
circle 22 of the cylinder clothing 4a and the<br>
sliding contact surface 20a is denoted by the<br>
reference C1 and the distance to the sliding<br>
contact surface 21a by the reference c2. The<br>
distance c2 is larger than the distance C1. The<br>
clothing 14d of the card flat bars 14I, 14II, 14III<br>
forms a respective acute angle a with the tangent<br>
to the cylinder clothing 4a, with the result that<br>
the carding nip narrows in the direction of<br>
rotation 4b of the cylinder 4. The distance<br>
between the clothing 14d and the cylinder clothing<br>
4a is denoted at the entry of the carding nip by<br>
the letter d, and at the exit by the letter a, d<br>
being greater than a. The angle of inclination a<br>
is termed the so-called "offset angle". The slow-<br>
running card flat barsl4I, 14II, 14III are located<br>
in the region of the card flat guide roller 13a,<br>
that is, in the region of the card flat exit or<br>
fibre intake.<br>
Referring to Fig. 3b, the pins 14b8, 14b10,<br>
14b12 lie on the sliding contact surface 20a of the<br>
second slideway 20 and the pins 14b7, 14b9 and 14b11<br>
lie on the sliding contact surface 21a on the<br>
first slideway 21. The sliding contact surface<br>
21a, visible in side view, is drawn with a<br>
continuous line and the partly visible sliding<br>
contact surface 20a is drawn with a dot-dash line.<br>
The distance between the tip circle 22 of the<br>
cylinder clothing 4a and the sliding contact<br>
surface 21a is denoted by the reference c3 and the<br>
distance to the sliding contact surface 20a by the<br>
reference c4. The distance c4 is larger than the<br>
distance c3. The clothing 14d of the card flat bars<br>
14IV, 14V, 14VI subtends a respective acute angle b<br>
with the tangent to the cylinder clothing 4a, with<br>
the result that the carding nip opens out in the<br>
direction of rotation 4b of the high-speed<br>
cylinder 4. The distance between the clothing 14d<br>
and the cylinder clothing 4a is denoted at the<br>
entry of the carding nip by the letter a, and at<br>
the exit by the letter e, e being greater than a.<br>
The angle of inclination b is termed the so-<br>
called counter-offset angle. The slow-running<br>
card flat bars 14IV, 14V, 14V are located in the<br>
region of the card flat guide roller 13b, that is,<br>
in the region of the card flat entry or fibre<br>
outlet. Figs 3a and 3b serve to illustraite the<br>
adjustment of the offset angle and counter-offset<br>
angle. The pins 14b which are of identical<br>
diameters in Figs 3a and 3b, can in practice also<br>
be of the form corresponding to Figs 5a to 5c.<br>
The angles a and b can be, for example, about<br>
1°. The distance a at the narrowest point of the<br>
carding nip is for all card flat bars 14I to 14VI<br>
preferably the same or almost the same and can be,<br>
for example 3/1000".<br>
Fig. 4a shows two curved slideways 20 and 21,<br>
which consist, for example, of anti-friction<br>
plastics material and are flexible. The slideways<br>
20, 21 are manufactured in one piece from a<br>
plastics material block, for example, by material-<br>
removing milling or similar processes. The<br>
slideways 20, 21 are formed without an<br>
intermediate space between them. Fig. 4b shows a<br>
one-piece construction similar to that of Fig. 4a,<br>
but in which between the slideways 20, 21 there is<br>
an intermediate space in the form of a<br>
longitudinal groove open at one side. The one-<br>
piece constructions shown in Fig 4a and Fig 4b are<br>
displaceable as a whole on the flexible bend 17 or<br>
on a carrier element 24 in the circumferential<br>
direction of the cylinder 4. Referring to Fig.<br>
4c, the slideways 20 and 21 are arranged on the<br>
carrier element 24 and are individually<br>
longitudinally slidable in the direction of the<br>
curved arrows D, E and F, G respectively. The<br>
slideways 20 and 21 can also be arranged<br>
separately (in a manner not shown) side by side on<br>
the flexible bend 17 so as to be displaceable in<br>
direction D, E and F, G. The slideways 20, 21 can<br>
be arranged with or without an intermediate space<br>
between them so as to be displaceable.<br>
As shown in a perspective view in Fig 4a to 4b<br>
and in side view in Fig. 4d, the sliding-contact<br>
surfaces 20a, 21a of the slideways 20, 21 are<br>
arranged so that they form an intersection point<br>
where they cross one another. As shown in Fig.<br>
4e, in the region of the outlet of the card<br>
flat bar 14I, a distance h1 is present between the<br>
height h3 of the sliding surface 21a and the height<br>
h4 of the sliding surface 20a. As shown in Fig.<br>
4g, in the region of the inlet of the card flat<br>
bar 14VI, a distance h2 is present between the<br>
height h5 of the sliding surface 20a and the height<br>
h6 of the sliding surface 21a. At the point at<br>
which the sliding-contact surfaces 20a, 21a shown<br>
in Fig. 4d intersect, Fig 4f shows that there is<br>
no distance in the vertical direction between the<br>
sliding contact surfaces 20a, 21a. In this way,<br>
the sliding-contact surfaces 20a, 21a of slideways<br>
20, 21 are arranged relative to one another such<br>
that the distances h1 and h2 in the vertical<br>
direction between the sliding-contact surfaces<br>
20a, 21a both increase and decrease. The<br>
distances h1 and h2 of the sliding-contact surfaces<br>
20a, 21a of the slideways 20, 21 do not become<br>
strictly uniformly either smaller or larger with<br>
respect to one another.<br>
Referring to Figs 5a to 5c, the card flat head<br>
consist of two sliding elements 14bI, 14bII, one<br>
end region of which is secured in apertures of the<br>
card flat heel part 14a (compare DE-A- 43 05 148).<br>
The sliding element 14b11 is a cylindrical pin of<br>
stainless steel having a diameter of, for example,<br>
6 mm; it projects beyond the end face of the card<br>
flat bar 14VI by distance g. The other sliding<br>
element 14b1 consists of a cylindrical pin 14.2<br>
having a diameter of, for example, 6 mm, at the<br>
free end of which a circular disc 14.1 of<br>
stainless steel having a diameter of, for example,<br>
18 mm, is mounted and projects beyond the end face<br>
of the<br>
card flat bar 14VI by distance f. In place of the<br>
disc 14.1, the pin 14.2 can be angled, that is,<br>
bent towards the sliding contact surface 21a.<br>
Distance f is larger than distance g. An elongate,<br>
flexible, curved carrier element 24 is arranged on<br>
the flexible bend 17, and can be displaced<br>
parallel to the flexible bend 17 and can be of<br>
wedge-form construction. On the upper side of<br>
the carrier element 24, the two curved slideways<br>
20 and 21 of, for example, anti-friction plastics<br>
material, are arranged in a secure manner side by<br>
side. In operation, the sliding element 14bII<br>
slides on the sliding-contact surface 20a (see<br>
Figs 4a to 4c) of the slideway 20 and the disc<br>
14.1 of the sliding element 14bI slides on the<br>
sliding-contact surface 21a (see Figs 4a to 4c) of<br>
the slideway 21.<br>
Because the diameter d1 of the disc 14.1 is<br>
larger than the diameter d2 of the pin 14bII and<br>
the distance f is larger than the distance g, at<br>
the card flat entry the sliding element 14bI<br>
extends over the sliding-contact surface 20a to<br>
engage with the sliding-contact surface 21a<br>
arranged lower down. At the same time, the<br>
shorter sliding element 14bII engages with the<br>
sliding-contact surface 20a arranged higher up.<br>
In this way, the opening carding nip of angle b is<br>
formed. As the card flat bar 14IV slides in<br>
direction C, at the card flat exit the sliding<br>
element 14bII, having slid beyond the intersection<br>
point of the two sliding-contact surfaces 20a,<br>
21a, engages with the now lower sliding-contact<br>
surface 20a and the disc 14.1 engages with the<br>
higher sliding-contact surface 21a. By angling<br>
the cardings bars, the closing carding nip of<br>
angle a is formed at the card flat exit.<br>
Referring to Figs 6a to 6c, a further<br>
construction with sliding-contact surfaces 20a,<br>
21a of different height is provided, in which the<br>
sliding elements 14b in the card flat bar 14 are<br>
arranged at different heights and in their end<br>
regions have the same diameter. The two sliding<br>
elements 14b on each card flat bar 14 are<br>
advantageously pins of stainless steel having a<br>
