				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to novel spiro 1,2,4-trioxanes of general formula 4. This invention more particularly relates to a process for the preparation of a series of novel spiro 1,2,4-trioxanes.<br>
(Formula removed)<br><br>
wherein, Ar represents aryl groups such as phenyl, 4-biphenyl, 4-chlorophenyl, 4-methoxyphenyl, 4-methylphenyl, 4-cyclohexylphenyl, 1-naphthyl, 2-naphthyl and the like and R represents hydrogen or the alkyl group such as methyl, ethyl and the like. Several of these novel compounds show high order of antimalarial activity against multidrug-resistant malaria in mice and thus hold promise as antimalarial agents against multidrug-resistant malaria. BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
Malaria is a parasitic disease which is caused by various species of Plasmodium protozoa. Together with AIDS and TB, malaria is responsible for largest number of deaths annually. The high rate of mortality associated with malaria can be attributed to the increasing cases of resistance of Plasmodium falciparum, the most deadly of the four human infecting malarial parasites, to the contemporary antimalarial drugs. Chloroquine is one of the most inexpensive, readily available, and probably most prescribed drugs for the chemotherapy of malaria, it has been rendered ineffective in many parts of the world, due to the emergence of multidrug-resistant P. falciparum. Against this background, discovery of artemisinin as the active principle of Chinese traditional drug against malaria, Artemisia annua, is an important milestone in malaria chemotherapy. Artemisinin is active against both chloroquine sensitive and chloroquine resistant malaria.<br>
(Formula removed)<br><br>
Semisynthetic derivatives of artemisinin such as arteether, artemether and artesunic acid, are several times more potent than the parent compound. The limited availability of artemisinin from malaria such as cerebral malaria [For reviews on artemisinin and its analogues see: (a) Klayman, D. L Science 1985, 228, 1049. (b) Bhattacharya, A. K.; Sharma, R. P. Heterocycles 1999, 57, 1681. (c) Borstnik, K.; Paik, I.; Shapiro, T. A.; Posner, G. H. Int. J. Parasitol. 2002, 32, 1661. (d) Ploypradith, P. Acta Trop. 2004, 89, 329.

Chem. 2004, 47, 2945].natural source and recognition of endoperoxide linkage in the form of a 1,2,4-trioxane ring system as the antimalarial pharmacophore of these compounds, has led to the present efforts to develop structurally simple synthetic trioxanes as substitutes of artemisinin derivatives. Several of these synthetic 1,2,4-trioxanes have shown promising antimalarial activity [(a) Bhattacharya, A. K.; Sharma, R. P. Heterocycles 1999, 51, 1681. (b) Borstnik, K.; Paik, I.; Shapiro, T.

The antimalarial activity of the test compounds was evaluated in rodent using multidrug resistant strain of Plasmodium yoelii Nigeriensis in Swiss mice. Random bred Swiss mice of either sex (20 ±2 gm) were inoculated intraperitoneally with lxlO5 P. yoelii (MDR) parasites on day zero. The treatments with test compounds were administered to group of 5 mice each at different dose levels ranging between 24-96 mg/ kg/day. The treatment was administered in groundnut oil intramuscularly and orally for 4 consecutive days (day 0-3). Blood smears from experimental mice were observed on day 4 and 7, day 10 and thereafter at regular intervals till day 28 or death of the animal. The parasitaemia level on day 4 was compared with vehicle control group and the percent suppression of parasitaemia in treated groups was calculated.<br>
For determining the curative dose of a compound the treated mice were observed till day 28. The dose at which no parasitaemia develop during the observation period has been reported as the curative dose. The antimalarial activity data is summarized in Table 2.<br>
