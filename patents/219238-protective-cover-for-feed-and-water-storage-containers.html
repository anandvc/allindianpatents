				<td>The present invention relates to an insect proof container for storing goods, preferably food and water, especially in regions with high risk for vector bom diseases<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Dengue fever (DF), dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS) are posing an increasing threat to the tropical and subtropical world. More than 100 countries are dealing with outbreaks and 2.5 billion people are currently suffering form the disease. WHO predicted that the worsening epidemiological trend is likely to continue. This is due to the increase in human movement and unplanned urbanization resulting in the increase in proliferation of man-made Aedes aegypti and Ae. atbopic-tus breeding habitats. In the WHO Global Strategy for prevention and control of den¬gue fever and DHF 1995, selective integrated vector control with community and in-tersectoriai participation was highlighted as the top priority among the five elements.<br>
Despite the increase in public health interventions to combat dengue fever and DHF, the control of its most important vector, Aedes aegypti, for the last few decades has not been very promising. In fact, its control has been described as one of the con¬spicuous failures of the 20^ century. The absence of proven, sustainable vector con¬trol methods and limited national and global resources are among the main contribu¬tory factors for this failure. Many countries" control programs lack an effective long-term breeding site management strategy and employ only the epidemic control, of which the application of insecticides against the adult vector is the mainstay. This mosquito species is also the most important vector of yellow fever. Thirty-three coun¬tries, with a combined population of 508 million, are at risk in Afri.ca. These lie within a band from 15°N to 10°S of the equator. In the Americas, yellow fever is endemic in nine South American countries and in several Caribbean islands. Bolivia, Brazil, Co¬lombia, Ecuador and Peru are considered at greatest risk.<br><br>
There are 200,000 estimated cases ofbyellow fever (with 30,000 deaths) per year. Small numbers of imported cases also occur in countries free ofyeliow fever. Al¬though yellow fever has never been reported from Asia, this region is at risk because the appropriate primates and mosquitoes are present. The disease was previously pre¬sent in Europe.<br>
Another important vector that recently has spread worldwide and also to Europe is Aedes albopitws. This species is also a vector of dengue virus and yellow fever virus, though often less efficacious than Ae. aeg\"pti. Both species are "container breeders". In some areas, the two compete for the same breeding sites, in other areas with longer co-existence, there is a habitat selection where Ae. aegypti breed in house and Ae. ai-bopictus out side, but both have the same biting patterns (aggressive day biters) and are dius difficult to control with bednets and the likes.<br>
Elimination of Aedes aegypti and alhopictus breeding sites is of paramount impor¬tance in the prevention and control of dengue and dengue hemorrhagic fever. In Cam¬bodia, the single most common Aedes aegypti breeding sites are 200 liter - 400 liter water storage jars. A survey done in 1999-2000 revealed that water jars constitute over 80% of the total breeding sites, in both wet and dry seasons, for both xaban and rural areas. Every effort should be made to prevent these water jars from becoming breed¬ing sites. Clearly, commimity clean up campaigns will have Uttle effect on the breed¬ing ofAe. aegypti without proper protection of &amp;ie permanent wato- storage jars that are the source of most breeding. The practice of emptying water jars weekly is seldom employed by the households due to the large si2e of the jars and/or the difficulty to obtain water. Abate (Teniephos) 1 % sand granules proved effective for up to 8 weeks when dosed at lOg/100 liters of water. Operationally, the use of larvicides in dengue control is time-consuming and requires a large workforce for application and supervi¬sion. Long term use of Temephos will also accelerate the emergence of resistance to Temephos. Furthermore, the addition of an insecticide to drinking water is often not accepted by the inhabitants.<br>
Use of water jar covers to deny access to oviposition female Ae. aegypti and albopiciis is an attractive aitemative. A preliminary study at two sites at Kandal Provinces sug-<br><br>
gested that households largely prefer to use jar covers for protection of water jars over other interventions. This can be sustainable and potentially an effective corranunity-hased vector control measure.<br>
However, there is no standard jar cover that has been introduced as yet, and the com¬mon jar covers used by the households in Cambodia are wood, cement, or metal and do not fit well. These ill fitting jar covers are usually not mosquito proof, and provide shading, factors tliat may render water jars more attract!\e to the Aedes aegypti breed¬ing.<br>
A mesh screen for preventing insects from entering water tanks is known from US patent no_5,816,2§S. This structure is rather expensive and is therefore not affordable by poor people in tropic countries. If such a cover is used by only some people in the population, still the insects may find breeding places where water jars are covered by less efficient screens or not covered. Furthermore, the screen as disclosed in US patent no. 5,816,288 has a solid cover, which prevents rain from entering the water tank. However, in tropic countries, where water is rare, the cover should allow rain to drain through, because the removal of the cover during rain may attract insects entering the tank.<br>
Summary of the Inventioa<br>
It is the purpose of the invention to improve covers, preferably removable, for con¬tainers for St tong goods, preferably for food and water storage. It is a further purpose of the invention to provide a method for preventuig mosquitoes to enter containers, especially to provide mosquito proof water containers that nevertheless allow water to drain in. Furthermore, the method and cover should be affordable and durable.<br>
The main purpose is achieved by a method for providing an insect proof container for storing goods, preferably water, wherein said method comprises providing a container with an opening, preferably a substantially upwardly oriented opening, providing an insect barrier comprising a fine meshed net, textile oi textile filter containing at least<br><br>
one insecticide, and covering said opening with said insect barrier for prohibiting in- sects, preferably mosquitoes, to enter said container.	|<br>
/<br>
As has turned out, which will be more apparent below, this method is extremely e cient for protecting goods, especially water, from mosquitoes or other insects. Inde¬pendently of the size of the opening of the container, a fitting insect barrier with a net may easily be provided for covering the opening, because such nets may be cut into the right size or sewed together for achieving larger covers. Also, nets may easily be -5 repaired when torn.<br>
In practice, no constraints are on the opening type in order to be covered. For example, the opening may be upwardly oriented or may have on opening at the side of the con¬tainer having a vertical border.<br>
A number of further advantages are connected to this invention will become apparent in the following.<br>
Normally, when an insect as a mosquito tries to enter the opening of a containei and is prohibited because of a net or likewise, the insect will continue its attempts trying to find a hole in the cover. Therefore, as described above, it is very difficult to protect container for goods, especially water in tropic countries because, often, covers do not fit completely tight to the opening, or a small hole may accidentally be in the cover. Even if the insect is prohibited from entering the container, it will just fly away and find another breeding place, for example another jar. Therefore also, for preventing mosquitoes from breeding, covering of water jars itself is not sufficient. When an in¬sect such as a grain beetle tries to enter a container with a textile cover, it may bore or gnaw its way through the textile. Moths like indian meal moth may deposit eggs in the textile, and the larvae may enter the food source. Thus, textile coverings may not be effective, even though the textiles are tightly fitted to the container.<br>
However, by providing an insect barrier with an insecticide according to the invention, the insect, for example mosquito, will receive the poison and die even though a pas-<br><br>
sage through the barrier may be found by the insect. Thus, the insecticide prevents the insect not only to breed in or feed on the goods inside the container but it prevents the insect to breed and feed anywhere else. The insecticide may also be a sterilizing agent to obtain that the deposited eggs do not develop into adult insects, for example mos¬quitoes, and that the insect is rendered sterile.<br>
A net that possibly may be used for such a cover is disclosed in International Paten Application WOOl/37662 by Ole Skovmand assigned to DCT. Such net material is commercially available at low cost-in Tropic countries. The material, typjcaliy poly¬ethylene or other man-made fibers, for the net is flexible, durable, and mechanically and chemically resistant. The net may be impregnated for long lasting efficiency where the impregnation may be repeated by surface treatment from time to time to assure proper functonting.<br>
Using a net, textile, or textile based fiUer instead of a solid cover, reduces the weight of the insect barrier. This aspect is very important, because such insect barriers liave to be transported to the place of use, for example in third world areas, where the infra¬structure is not so well developed and transport often is achieved by airplanes. Thus, a reduction of the weight reduces the overall costs of the insect barrier. Because of its flexibility, a net can be stored very efficiently taking up only relatively small space, for example as large rolls of net, which also is important for the above mentioned transportation means. A net, textile, or textile based filter is also very easy to arrange around an opening, even if the border of the opening is not smooth or plane. Addition¬ally, an insect barrier with a net, textile, or textile based filter according to the inven¬tion prevents dirt to enter the water container, especially the textile. If the filter is made sufficiently tight, it may also largely reduce bacterial contamination. Preferably however, the textile, or textile based filter according to the invention is water perme¬able such that rain water may drain through and into a collecting system.<br>
A simple embodiment of the insect barrier may be a net of the above kind including means for exerting downward force to the barrier for keeping the barrier stretched over the opening, where it is now assumed that the opening is substantially upwardly ori-<br><br>
enred. This way, a tight contact to the border of the opening can be achieved when the opening is covered with the insect barrier. Those means may be weishts that have been fastened to the flexible barrier. Alternatively, the means may comprise pockets to be filled with stones, sand or other weight materia!.<br>
Alternatively, the net or textile may have a flexible rim, for example a rini made of tarpaulin. The tarpaulin may be used for fastening the weights or pockets to the insect barrier. Ftirtherraore, the tarpaulin may also be designed to rest on the border of the container, for example a water jar, in order to prevent the net from being torn on even¬tually sharp edges of the border of the container, for example a metal drum used as a water jar.<br>
The insect barrier may solely be flexible in order to ease transportation of the insect barrier. However, in some circumstances, the barrier may be desired to comprise a frame. In tropic cotintries, after delivery of the flexible part of the barrier, the popula¬tion may itself build such a frame from the material at hand. An insect barrier accord¬ing to the invention is easily mounted with a frame independently of the dimensions of the frame.<br>
However, a frame may already be part of the msect barrier when delivered. For exam¬ple, such a frame may be a circular metal or polymer firame covered with a net, textile or textile filter, eventually vnth a tarpaulin rim. A typical diameter of such a frame is around one meter. In order to ease transportation of this frame, the frame may com¬prise two identical, rigid parts connected by flexible means, for example the net, tex¬tile or textile filter itself, for folding the two parts together to ease transportation of the insect barrier. Preferably, the two parts of the frame are half-circles forming a com¬plete circle when the insect barrier is stretched out.<br>
The container and the corresponding frame may be such that the frame rest tightly on the border of the opening of the container. Aitematively, the opening may be received in the frame such that the frame sunounds the opening of the container. For example," the aforementioned circular frame may have a diameter slightly larger than the open-<br><br>
ing of the container. In tins case, the flexible part of the insect barrier will rest on the border of the opening and the weight of the frame keeps the flexible part of the barrier stretched over the border of the opening with a tight contact between the insect bairier and die opening.<br>
Alternatively, the insect barrier according to the invention may be arranged as an um¬brella for covering the container opening in its open state. Such an insect barrier is easily contracted into a slim form for transportation and storage. A further alternative embodiment is achieved with a net, textile or textile filter equipped with an elastically contractable rim in order to surround the wall of the opening m a tight manner.<br>
Once an insect bairier is covering the opening, water or other liquid, may drain through the net of the barrier. For example, the container being ajar with an upwardly oriented opening, rain water may drain through the net and into the jar On the other hand, water may also be poured out of the container through the net. Thus, the cover does not require to be removed in order to fill or empty a liquid container. According to the invention, water permeable textile or textile filter may be used in an analogue way. For storage of dry goods like grain, the textile may be treated to be hydrophobic and thus add to the physical protection of the goods.<br>
ID. case that the goods to be stored is water, especially if rain is desired to drain through fee barrier, it is an advantage if the at least one insecticide is insoluble in wa¬ter. Also, the barrier with the net, textile or textile filter preferably does not contain detergents dissolving any of the insecticides by contact with water. In case, the water is not used for drinking, a low toxic insecticide may be used, which, in addition, may be partly water soluble, like Temephos.<br>
The insect barrier may be treated with the at least one insecticide by surface treatment. An alternative treatment is incorporation of the insecticide inside the net fiber, typi¬cally during manufacture of the fiber. The insecticide may then migrate to the surface of the net fiber. This way, the insecticidal properties of the net is maintained for a long time without insecticide surplus on the surface. As a consequence, only a minor<br><br>
auiuuat may oe released to the water. Tlie migration speed and the release to water of<br>
the insecticide may further be controlled by incorporating migration inhibitors for the<br>
insecticide.	^g"	.■■-"^<br>
In order to prevent or at least reduce U\"" disintegration of the insecticide, the insect barrier may contain a L^V protective^m^ium. This L^V" protecting medium may be located at the surface of ihe net fibers or may be incorporated in the fiber for migration r to the surface of the fiber. Advantageously, the UV protecting medium may be resis¬tant against water snch that it is not dissolved from the insect barrier, for example the net and the tarpaulin rim, in case that the insect barrier is in contact with the water. In order to control the migration speed of incorporated L~\" protecting medium, migration inliibitors may be used at a concentration matching the desired migration properties.<br>
A net according to the invention may in addition be provided with a releasable water cleaning or disinfecting agent. Such an agent may be released in predetermined por¬tions during water drainage through the insect barrier. The agent may as well be re¬leased if the insect barrier is in contact with the water in the jar, for example if the barrier in form of a net is hanging into the water in the jar.<br>
A net according to the invention may as well be provided witli releasable rnedic^jub-stances. For example fluor-compositions are known to have beneficial properties for teeth. Drugs in minor amounts for curing certain deceases or for improving the human unmune defense system may be incorporated as well. Another example is tea-tree oil, which is known for its stimulating and for humans in many ways healthy properties. In this coimection, it is worth noting that tea tree oil has also been recognized as being antibacterial and recognized for repelling certain insects. Thus, certain substances may serve a multi purpose in connection with the insect barrier according to the invention.<br>
Also incorporated may be substances fox giving the water a certain taste, for example lemon flavor or peppermint.<br><br>
In some cases, jars to be protected from insects may contain impure water, for exam¬ple water for fertilizing the ground. Such water may ha\"e a high content of bacteria, some of which directly or indirectly may result in decomposition of certain msecli-cides if the insect barrier is in contact with this water. In this case, the insect barrier in addition may be provided with substances that retard or prevent this kind of decompo¬sition. Indications have been found that certainUV protecting media have this protect¬ing property.	 The insecticide is preferably an insect killing insecticide, for example Temephos or Deltamethrin. Also used may be various specific larvicides or growth inhibiting insec¬ticides. However, the insecticide may also function in a more sophisticated way in that the insect is not killed after contact with the insecticide but remains sterile. Thus, the insect may still mate and produce egg, but the eggs do not produce larvae. Another option is an insecticide comprising the synthetic juvenile hormone Mefhopren, which kills larvae when they slough the skin.<br>
An insect barrier of the above kind may as well be provided with a chemical Cholera filter which would result in an additional reduction of illness in tropic regions.<br>
In order to manipulate the insecticidal effect of the insect barrier, it may be provided in special colors in order to attract certain insect species, for example blue for attrac¬tion of mosquitoes, or to repel certain insect species. Also, the insect barrier may be provided with selected insect attracting substances as pheromones or other attracting odors.<br>
An efficacy study has been undertaken in connection with the insect barrier according to the invention. The net, 100% polyester, with the mesh size of 25/cm2, Deltamethrin industrially impregnated with a dosage of 50 mg a.i.."m2 was used as insect barrier for jar lids. The lids comprised a PVC hoop with the impregnated fabrics stretched across.<br>
The experimental designs took into the following considerations:<br><br>
that all the water jars used by the households were positioned under out¬door conditions,<br>
that it was likely that the net was partially submerged in the water inside the jar due to prolonged use of the insect barrier,<br>
that it was likely that the jars were positioned under a roof gutrer and con¬stantly subject to the flushing of rainwater from the roof.<br>
While acknowiedging the above factors, a worst case scenario was taken into account including the placing of the net cover submerged in the water jar over the study period of 3 months, and flushing the cover weekly.<br>
Four 200- [iters water jars, filled with rain water were maintained for the duration of study period. WHO standard Bioassay Cone was used to expose Aedes aegypti fe¬males to the insecticide containing net for 10 minutes. For each efficacy test, 10 two-day old Aedes aegypti females were used. The mosquito colony originated -from larvae collected from Phnom Penh. The knock down effect (KD) and the mortality were re¬corded at 10 minutes interval for the first hour, and hourly for the following time. The total KD and mortality was assessed at the end of the 24 bout period after exposure. The tests were replicated on a weekly basis.<br>
The jars recruited in the study wore arranged in the following manners. One net was partially submerged in the water, one jar cover was without directly contact with the water, and one net was kept away from sunlight and rain.<br>
Even after 8 weeks, the insect barriers with the insecticidal impregnated net still gave satisfactory results. It turned out that also the net submerged in water did not lose its potency even after 8 weeks. The results furthennoTe indicated that the total mortality after 24 hours from outdoor and indoor jars did not differ significantly.<br>
The invention will be explained in more detail in the following with reference to the drawings.<br><br>

Detailed Description / Description of Preferred Embodiment<br>
FIG. la illustrates a container iOO with an insect barrier 200 to cover the opening 102 of the container 100, for example a water jar. In a first embodiment, the insect barrier 200 comprises a frame 201 configured to receive the border 101 of the opening 102 in the fi-ame 201. This embodiment of the insect barrier 200 is also shown in cross sec¬tion in FIG. lb. In use, the fi-ame 201 as shown in FIG. lb rests tightly on the border 101 of the container preventing insects to enter the container 100.<br>
The invention covers not only nets, but also textile or textile filters in addition or in¬stead of the net. For simplicity the invention will be explained in the case of a net, however without limiting the scope of the invention.<br>
Witiun ftie firame 201, a net 202 prevents insects fiom entering the container 100. The rim of the net 202 includes a tarpaulin 203 which again is fastened to the firame 201. In case that tlie insect barrier 200 is to be removed -from the container 100, it will typi¬cally be lifted and held at the fi-ame 201. The tarpaulin 203 protects the net from being damaged under such circumstances. Alternatively, the net 202 may be fastened to the frame 201 directly. This is especially of advantage if a light weight structure is de¬sired.<br>
The frame may be constructed in a different way, which is illustrated in FIG. Ic. The shown frame 201" is configured to rest on the border lOl of the container 100, but does not receive the border of the opening in the container. This is of advantage, if the<br><br>
border 101 of the opening 102 of the container JOG is of rather broad dimension, for example if the wall of the container 100 is thick. The frame 201" may in this case rest on borders 101 of different sizes as Iongas the outer diameter of the frame 301" is larger than the inner diameter of the border 101.<br>
In FIG. Id, an insect barrier is shown with a frame 20  which is configured larger than the border 101 of the openmg 102 of the container 100. In this case, after place¬ment of the insect barrier 200 on the container 100, the tarpaulin 203 wili rest on the border 101 of the container. The border 101 may be sharp edged, for example if the container 100 is an old peti"ol or diesel oil drum where the top part has been removed and which now is used as a water jar. In this case, the tarpaulin 203 prevents the net 202 form being damaged by the sharp edge of the border 101.<br>
A light weight model of the insect barrier 200 is shown in FIG. 1 e. In this case, a light ■weight frame 201"", typically amelal or stiff polymer frame holds the net 202 which spans over more than the outline of the container 100. When the insect barrier 200 is placed on the container 100, the net 202 covers the opening 102 of the container 100 and rests tightly on the border 101 of the opening 102. This situation is illustrated in FIG. If The weight of the frame 201"" holds the net m place on the container 100.<br>
In its most simple form, the insect barrier only consists of a net 202 that is placed over the container 100, for example a water jar as shown in FIG. 2. In order to hold the net 202 in place, weights 204 may be fastened to the net for exerthig downwards force on the net 202. Alternatively, the weights may accomplished by pockets fastened to the net, into which pockets sand, stones, liquids or other weight material has been in¬serted.<br>
It has to be pointed out that the opening of the container may have other cross sections than circular. It may as well be a polygon, for example rectangular, or have any regu¬lar or irregular shape.<br><br>
The invention may as well be used for other types of containers, for example a pitcher ! 03 as shown in FIG. 3a, or a container 104 with a wide opening 105 for other goods than liquids as shown in FIG. 3b. The pitcher 103 as shown in FIG. 3a may be filled and emptied without removing a mounted insect barrier, when the net covers the open¬ing. In this case, however, if the water is used for drinking or food preparation, it is preferred that the insecticide contained in the net is insoluble in water such that the insecticide is not transfened to the water or aqueous liquid inside the container 103.<br>
Other goods than liquid in a container with insect barrier according to the invention may be wet goods, as meat, or dry goods, as dried meat or grains. Wet meat is attrac¬tive as a breeding place for a variety of insects, for example flies. Even dried meat is subject to attack by insects, for example Dennestes haemorrhoidales- Grains are at¬tractive to a variety of other insects, for example Ephestia kulmiella, Orysaephihis surinamensis, Sitophihis gi-anariws, S. Oiyzae, Tenebrio tnelltor, Tribolhiin confiism, and T destnictor. For this kind of insects, the insect barrier may be chosen with a tex¬tile. A fabric would act as a physical barrier to these insects, where the content of in¬secticide may be higher than for nettings. In this connection, it has to be pointed out that more than 20% of the third world food storage is spoiled or consumed by insects and rodents every year.<br>
An insect barrier according to the invention, however, may not protect goods efS-ciently from rats or mice that may bite holes into the insect barrier. However, by im¬pregnating the insect barrier according to the invention with a bitter substance as Bi-trex"™, rats and mice are less likely to chew themselves through the insect barrier. Es¬pecially, due to the possibility of a higher amount of stored bitter substance, fabrics may be preferred to nettings in this case.<br>
The insect barrier as shown in FIG. 1 may stay on the container when liquid as water is filled into the container, for example rain water. Also in this case, it is of advantage that the insecticide is insoluble in water and that the net 202 does not contain deter¬gents which could bind the insecticide to water.<br><br>
In FIG. 4a, the cross section of a fiber 300 for the net 200 is shown. The fiber 300 con¬tains an insecticide 301 on the surface of the fiber 300, which is illustrated by dots. The fiber may also be constructed such, that the insecticide 301 is incorporated in the fiber 300" as shown in FIG b. The insecticide 303 may then migrate to the surface of the fiber 300" such that the fiber has an insecticidal property for a long time, as the release of the insecticide is relatively slow, though hovve\-er fast enough to ensure a concentration of insecticide on the surface of the fiber 300" sufficiently high to have a lethal effect on insects touching the fiber 300". For example, the fiber 300" may have an mtemal reservoir 303 with insecticide which is released for migration to the sur¬face.<br>
hi order to limit the destroying influence of sunlight on the insecticide, a UV protect¬ing agent may be incorporated in the fiber 300, 300" as well. For example, the UV protecting agent may be on the surface of the fiber, but it may also be incoiporated inside the fiber 300" for migration to the surface in order to achieve a slow release with long time protection.<br>
The tarpaulin 203 surrounding the net 202 may also contain an insecticide 301. Such a tarpaulin may be constructed such that the insecticide is contained inside the tarpaulin 203 material with migration of the insecticide 301 to the surface of the tarpaulin 203, this is illustrated In FIG. 5a- Alternatively, the tarpaulin may be a laminated structure with an inside reservoir 304 for release of insecticide for migration through the wall element 305 of the laminated tarpaulin 203.<br>
Apart from Aedes aegypii, it is also of interest to prevent Cnlex from breeding in water jars. The invention is equally adaptable in this case.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
