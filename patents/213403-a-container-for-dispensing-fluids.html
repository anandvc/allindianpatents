COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
(See section 10; rule 13)<br>
Title of the invention<br>
  	 A CONTAINER FOR DISPENSING FLUIDS<br>
HINDUSTAN LEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913 having its registered office at Hindustan Lever House, 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai-400 020, State of Maharashtra, India<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed<br><br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a flexible container for dispensing fluids.<br>
BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ART<br>
It is known to pack fluid e.g. liquid products in containers made from flexible material that are opened by tearing/ cutting in order to evacuate the fluid.  An example of such containers are blister packs'.<br>
There exists a great variety of such containers on the market, including those to be opened at some portion or end and whose entire contents must be released at once (single dose containers).  One problem with many such containers is that due to their flexibility and/or shape, if they are left to rest on a surface after opening, the fluid tends to leak out.  Such containers are therefore unsuitable for repeated use.<br>
One solution to this problem has been to add a closure, such as a lid, or a sealing or resealing means.  Such additions all involve the development of additional and/or complex elements that also involve high production and marketing costs.<br>
2<br><br>
Some flexible, self sealing, laminate containers have been disclosed in patents US4988016, US5529224 and US5839609. US4988016 discloses a thermo laminated container with convex portions on both faces that forms the body of the liquid container, and that connect to an upper channel in a right angle which in turn includes a sealed mouth that is to be fitted in a previously defined zone in order, to evacuate the product.<br>
US5529224 substantially discloses a thermo laminated container with a convex portion on at least one face which forms the containing, body of the liquid, and which connects to a central channel to evacuate the product, which in turn includes a self closing flat valve and sealed mouth that is to be fitted in a previously defined zone in order to evacuate the product.<br>
US5839609 basically discloses a thermo laminated container, with a convex portion on only one face which forms the containing body of the liquid, and which connects to a cross shaped central channel to evacuate the product, which in turn includes a valve, retention chambers and a sealed mouth that is to be fitted in a previously defined zone in order to evacuate the product.<br>
In the prior art, there exist flexible containers that have a channel to evacuate the liquid and that are able to control more or less effectively the output flow of the product.<br>
3<br><br>
However, the containers of the prior art have only a single evacuation mouth that has to be fitted to that effect in a predetermined zone, and as such' provide only a single exit to evacuate the liquid, which restricts the evacuation possibilities.<br>
Also known, are flexible containers having a narrow evacuation channel thus enabling the user to control more or less effectively the output flow of the fluid.  However, these containers have only a single evacuation exit in a predetermined position.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a fluid dispensing container which can be used for repeated disensing of the contained fluid, and can permit the dispensing of fluids having different flow properties and viscosities.<br>
According to one aspect of the invention, there is provided a container for dispensing fluids comprising a first sheet member and a second sheet member, co-joined to define a fluid reservoir in fluid communication with an upper evacuation channel with exit means, which can be opened to permit fluid from the container to flow in response to the application of external pressure, characterised in that the container has self-standing means and the exit channel has a serpentine formation with a plurality of exit means.<br>
With this arrangement, the container is suitable for repeated use, as it can stand upright and so there no (or at<br>
4<br><br>
least less) risk of spillage after opening.  Also the provision of multiple exit means permits the dispensing of the fluid at different flow rates and/or having different viscosities.<br>
In this specification, positional terms such as upper, lower, ascending, descending should be interpreted with reference to the container in an upright position, as seen in figure 1.<br>
The first sheet member may provide a body portion of the reservoir and the evacuation channel.  The upper part of the body portion may taper to form the evacuation channel which is, by comparison, narrower in cross section.  The second sheet member may provide a covering portion for the body portion and the evacuation channel.<br>
Preferably the exit means are located at spaced apart locations, by which fluid may be dispensed from the body. These locations may be generally tranversely aligned.<br>
For example, in the embodiment referred to above, the first ascending zone has a first exit means and the second undulating zone e.g. ascending has a second exit means.<br>
The serpentine evacuation channel may be formed with a first ascending zone and a second undulating zone.<br>
In one embodiment, the upper taper of the reservoir is orientated generally upwardly and toward one side, e.g. at roughly 45 degrees to a transverse axis of the container,<br>
5<br><br>
and the evacuation channel of the dispensing container is formed by a first ascending zone and a second undulating zone defined by a portion having a reduced radius ascending curvature followed by a portion having a broad radius descending curvature with an ascending end portion. The exit channel is of such dimensions and shape that it is capable of being opened at least two different points, preferably two points, along its length to allow dispensing of fluid at different flow rates or for the dispensing of fluids of different viscosities.  As many openings as necessary may be made along the channel to allow the fluid evacuation.  Preferably a first evacuation opening can be made in the first substantially straight zone and a second evacuation opening can be made in the second curved zone. In this way, flow rate of the fluid contained in the reservoir can be controlled for fluids of different viscosities.<br>
There may be further undulating or curved portions which may be arranged in preferably a nested configuration.<br>
One advantage of this arrangement is the package is highly space-efficient in providing multiple exit locations.<br>
The evacuation channel is initially sealed, but as many alternative evacuation means as necessary may be included along the channel to allow the liquid evacuation.  Cutting the first and second laminated member in any portion of the liquid evacuation channel will be necessary to fit some of the liquid evacuation ways.<br>
6<br><br>
Preferably the container is shaped in such a way that when it is stood on a' (horizontal) level surface at least a part, and preferably the or each ascending portion, of the evacuation channel is generally upright.<br>
In one embodiment the ascending portion is at right angles to the plane in which the effective base lies.  The effective base comprises those parts of the container in contact with the surface when the container is stood on a level surface area.<br>
The reservoir can be of any shape suitable for containing fluid and may be substantially conic e.g. a semi-truncated cone shape, whose upper end is orientated away from the central axis of the cone, towards the evacuation channel.<br>
The self-standing means may be effected by the shape of the reservoir the base of which may be wider and deeper when compared with the upper section (such as a cone shape, or inverted V-shape etc) and may taper outwards progressively or in a step-wise manner in the direction of the base, so as to ensure a low centre of gravity when partly/wholly filled with liquid.<br>
The self standing means may include feet portions which protrude from the reservoir bas and also may act as a means of providing rigidity of the container, aiding recovery of the container's original shape after it has been subject to<br>
7<br><br>
the application of external pressure, most typically by hand, in order to cause liquid to flow from the reservoir.<br>
The sheet members may be laminated e.g. having a layered structure and/or made by adding layers of material together. The sheet members may be co-joined e.g. sealed together around their perimetrical contours to define the reservoir and evacuation channel.  The sheet e.g. preferably directly to one another (e.g. by heat) or with adhesive.<br>
The sheet members may be essentially rectangular in shape, shape and may have with rounded/smoothly curved corners.  Of course, the sheet members may form other suitable shapes, for example, oval, square, round, etc.<br>
The or each of the sheet members of the dispensing container are preferably formed of resilient flexible material.  The first sheet member (which may form the body portion) is preferably formed in a polymeric material preferably flexible enough to recover its original shape after it has been subject to the application of external pressure, most typically by hand, in order to cause liquid to flow from the reservoir.<br>
The exit/s may be opened with an incision or by piercing with any suitable object such as a pair of scissors, a knife, a pin etc.  Alternatively, the two layers may be peeled apart, for example by peeling the second sheet member away from the first sheet member using the fingers.<br>
8<br><br>
Preferably there are visual indicia to direct the user to opening/s.<br>
The packaging may be perforated, for example for the purposes of storage, transportation, display or use.  The perforation can preferably be made in the upper central part of the packaging, so that it can be hung in an essentially upright position'.<br>
The container may be constructed any suitable means, preferably by conventional thermoforming methods, in general by comprising of placing a first sheet of formable film over a forming die having a cavity, heating the film to mould the film into the cavity thereby forming a recess in the film (which forms the body portion of the container), placing a fluid in the thus formed recess, and sealing a second sheet of film across the recess to close the package.<br>
The container may be used for a wide variety of fluids for domestic or industrial use, for example, personal care fluids such as shower gels, creams, soap, shampoo; hard surface cleaners for domestic or industrial use; beverages, medicines and chemicals.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
An non-limiting embodiment of the invention will now be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:<br>
9<br><br>
Figure 1 is a plan view of a container according to one embodiment of the present invention;<br>
Figure 2 is an end view showing the base of the container of Figure 1;<br>
Figure 3 is a sectional view of the container of Figure 1 taken along the line A-A;<br>
Figure 4 is a side view of the container of Figure 1 from the direction of X; and<br>
Figures 5 and 6 show a container according to another embodiment of the invention".<br>
Throughout the Figures common numbers are used to designate similar components.<br>
Referring to the drawings, a container 1 for dispensing fluids comprising a first sheet member 3 and a second sheet member 5, co-joined to define a fluid reservoir  7 in fluid communication with an upper evacuation channel 9 with exit means 11,13 which can be opened to permit fluid 15 from the container 1 to flow in response to the application of external pressure, characterised in that the container has self-standing means 17,19,?1 and the exit channel 9 has a serpentine formation with a plurality of exit means 11,13.<br>
The first sheet member 3 provides a body portion of the reservoir 7 and evacuation channel 9.  The second sheet 5<br>
10<br><br>
member provides a generally flat cover portion for the body portion and evacuation channel.<br>
The reservoir 7 has a convex swollen section that permits to contain the liquid.<br>
The reservoir has the shape of a semi-truncated cone shaped with an upper end portion 31 which is (in plan view) orientated away from the central axis of the conic section and which tapers towards the exit channel 4 at one side of the container 1.<br>
The upper taper 31 of the reservoir is orientated generally upwardly and toward one side, at roughly 45 degrees to a transverse axis of the container.<br>
The evacuation channel 9 of the dispensing container 1 is formed by a first ascending zone 33 and a second undulating zone 35 defined by a portion 37 having a reduced radius ascending curvature followed by a portion 39 having a broad radius descending curvature and an ascending end portion 41.<br>
The evacuation channel has a width of from 0.39 in (10 mm) to 0.03 (1 mm).  The first ascending zone has a width from 0.39 in (10 mm) to 0.19 in (5 mm).  The nearest channel ascending zone to the upper part of the body portion has a width from 0.39 in (10 mm) to 0.31 in (8 mm).  The second undulated zone has a preferably width of 0.19 in (5 mm). The ascending end progressively diminishes to a pointed end or alternatively it may terminate in a convex form.<br>
11<br><br>
The evacuation channel has a thickness from 0.19 in (5	mm)<br>
to 0.03 (1 mm), preferably a thickness from 0.07 in (2	mm)<br>
to 0.15 in (4 mm), more preferably a thickness of 0.11	in<br>
(3 mm) .<br>
The cross section of the channel has preferably a convex<br>
form, or may have a rectangular one with rounded outer<br>
apexes.<br>
The two spaced apart exit means 11,13 are provided at<br>
tranversely aligned positions in ascending portions of the<br>
channel 9.<br>
The sheet members 3,5 are laminated and sealed together around their perimeters to define the reservoir and evacuation channel.<br>
The sheet members have an essentially rectangular outer perimeter'(when viewed in plan view) with rounded corners.<br>
The or each of the sheet members of the dispensing container are formed of resilient flexible material.<br>
The first sheet member forming the body portion is formed from a polymeric material sufficiently flexible to recover its original shape after it has been subject to the application of external pressure, most typically by hand, in order to cause liquid to flow from the reservoir and selected from e.g. polypropylene (PP), polyethylene (PE) , or polyethyleneterephthalate (PET).  In a preferred embodiment,<br>
12<br><br>
the dispensing container may be manufactured of PP between 250 and 100 microns, or PE between 10 and 300 microns, or PET between 10 and 50 microns, as preferable materials non restricted to other embodiments.<br>
However, the present invention is not limited to the above mentioned polymeric materials, and other flexible materials available in the market may also be used to manufacture the dispensing container.<br>
The container 1 is shaped with so that when stood on a level (horizontal) surface, the ascending portions of the evacuation channel are generally upright.  This prevents spillage of fluid from the evacuation channel after opening when the container is stood upright.  This is achieved by the level base edge 23 of the container perimeter 25 in combination with the reservoir base 27 and the shape of the reservoir 7 as a whole which allows stable self standing on an effective base generally to the ascending channels.<br>
The self-standing means party relies on the shape of the reservoir the base of which is wider and deeper than the upper section (because of the cone shape) and tapers outwards (when viewed from a side)in the direction of the base, so providing a wide, base with a low centre of gravity when partly/wholly filled with liquid.<br>
The self standing means include a pair of feet 43 which are formed as elongate convex portions protruding from the reservoir base.  These also act as a means of providing<br>
13<br><br>
rigidity of the container, aiding recovery of the container's original shape after it has been subject to the application of external pressure, most typically by hand, in order to cause liquid to flow from the reservoir 7.<br>
Visual indicia (not shown) are provided to direct the user to opening/s.<br>
The container 1 shown is constructed by conventional thermoforming methods, in general placing the first sheet 3 of formable film over a forming die having a cavity, heating the film to mould the film into the cavity thereby forming a recess in the film (which forms the body portion 7,9 of the container), placing a fluid 15 in the thus formed recess, and sealing a second sheet 5 of film across the recess to close the container 1.<br>
A centered perforation 43 is provided in the upper part of the.sheets that permits the dispensing container to be hung in an generally upright position.<br>
The evacuation channel 9 is initially sealed.  In use, an incision, tear or other opening is. made in evacuation channel and pressure applied to reservoir 7 to squeeze the contents out.  In principle, the user may make an incision at position 11 if a high flow is desired or at position 13 for a lower flow rate.<br>
14<br><br>
