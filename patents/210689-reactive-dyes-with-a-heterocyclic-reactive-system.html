and also to a process for dyeing and printing hydroxyl-containing or nitrogenous substrates with the novel dyes.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide novel reactive dyes having advantageous application properties- The novel dyes shall be especially suitable for the exhaust and cold pad-batch process and shall be notable in particular for high<br><br>
yield, high wetfastness properties and brilliant dyeings. In addition, the unfixed portions shall be easy to wash off.<br>
We have found that this object is achieved by the reactive dyes of the formula I defined at the beginning and also their use for dyeing or printing hydroxyl-containing or nitrogenous organic<br>
substrates.<br>
The novel reactive dyes of the formula I are each indicated in the form of the free acid. It will be appreciated that their salts are likewise encompassed by the claims.<br>
Suitable cations are derived from metal or ammonium ions. Metal ions are especially lithium, sodium or potassium ions. Ammonium ions for the purposes of the present invention are substituted or unsubstituted ammonium cations. Examples of substituted ammonium cations are monoalkyl-, dialkyl-, trialkyl-, tetraalkyl- or benzyltrialkyl-ammonium cations or those cations derived from nitrogenous five- or six-membered saturated heterocycles, such as pyrrolidinium, piperidinium, morpholinium, piperazinium or N-alkylpiperazinium cations or their N-monoalkyl- or N,N-dialkyl-substituted products. Alkyl is generally straight-chain or branched C1-C20-alkyl, which may be substituted by 1 or 2 hydroxyl groups and/or interrupted by from 1 to 4 oxygen atoms in ether function.<br>
In general, all alkyl and alkylene groups mentioned above and appearing in formulae which follow may be straight-chain or<br>
branched.<br>
Substituted alkyl radicals preferably contain, unless otherwise stated, 1, 2 or 3 substituents, especially 1 or 2 substituents, in any desired position.<br>

L4 may also be for example (CH2)7/ (CH2)8, 1,2-, 1,3- or<br>
1, 4-phenylene, which may be mono- or disubstituted by methyl,<br>
methoxy or hydroxysulfonyl,<br>
Het is the radical of a 5- or 6-membered aromatic heterocyclic ring containing from 1 to 3 heteroatoms selected from the group consisting of oxygen, sulfur and nitrogen.<br>
Suitable heterocyclic parent species, which may bear sub-stituents, for derivations of the Het radicals include for example pyrrole, furan, thiophene, pyrazole, imidazole, oxazole, thiazole, isothiazole, 1,2,4-triazole, 1,2,4-oxadiazole, 1, 3,4-oxadiazole, 1,2,4-thiadiazole, 1,3,4-thiadiazole, pyridine, pyridazine, pyrimidine or pyrazine. Suitable substituents include for example C1-C4-alkyl, phenyl, halogen, cyano, carboxyl or C1-C4-alkoxycarbonyl.<br>
Q is an alkali-detachable group. Such groups include for example chlorine, bromine, C1-C4-alkylsulfonyl, phenylsulfonyl, OSO3H, SS03H, 0P(0)(OH)2f C1-C4-alkylsulfonyloxy, phenylsulfonyloxy, C1-C4-alkanoyloxy, C1-C4-dialkylamino or a radical of the formula<br><br>
where Z7, Z9 and Z9 are identical or different and each is independently of the others C1-C4-alkyl or benzyl and Ane is in each case one equivalent of an anion. Suitable anions include for example fluoride, chloride, bromide, iodide, mono-, di- or<br><br>
trichloracetate, methanesulfonate, benzenesulfonate or 2- or 4-methylbenzenesulfonate.<br><br>
can be identical or different.<br>
When b is 1, the radicals W can likewise be identical or different.<br><br>
where A1, A2, Het, L3 and Y are each as defined above, will hereinafter be referred to as "Eff.<br>
Preference is given to reactive dyes of the formula I where L3 is C1-C4-alkylene with or without interruption by one oxyen atom in ether function.<br>
Preference is further given to reactive dyes of the formula I where A1 and A2 are independently of each other hydrogen, nitro, amino, hydroxysulfonyl or a radical of the formula SO2C2H4OSO3H. Preferred substituents A1 and/or A2 are in particular hydrogen and hydroxysulfonyl.<br>
Preference is further given to reactive dyes of the formula I where Het is the radical of a 5-membered heterocycle. Emphasis is given in this connection to those radicals which have 3 heteroatoms, in particular those which are derived from 1,3,4-oxadiazole, 1,2,4-thiadiazole or 1,3,4-thiadiazole, especially 1,2,4-oxadiazole-3,5-diyl.<br>
Preference is further given to reactive dyes of the formula I where Y is a radical of the formula -C2H4SSO3H, -C2H4C1, -C2H4OCOCH3 and also in particular -C2H4OSO3H or vinyl. Particular technical interest pertains to the fiber-reactive groups of the formula Ila or lib<br><br><br>
Preference is further given to reactive dyes of the formula I where L1 is ortho-disposed to the heterocycle in case 1).<br>
Preference is additionally given to dyes of the formula I where the substituents are selected from a combination of the above-recited preferred substituents.<br>
The SO2Y radicals are aliphatic fiber-reactive groups as distinct from heterocyclic fiber-reactive groups. Fiber-reactive groups are the groups which react with the hydroxyl or nitrogenous groups of the substrates substitutively or additively.<br>
Substitutive reaction of the fiber-reactive group with the relevant groups in the substrates, for example with the hydroxyl groups of cellulose, means that the leaving groups or atoms (e.g. fluorine or chlorine) in the fiber-reactive group are substitutively replaced by the hydroxyl groups of the cellulose as per the following scheme:<br><br><br>
Additive reaction of the fiber-reactive group with the relevant groups in the substrates, for example with the hydroxyl groups of cellulose, means that the hydroxyl groups of the cellulose undergo an addition reaction with the fiber-reactive group as per the following scheme:<br><br>
Examples of heterocyclic fiber-reactive groups are halogen-substituted radicals derived from 1,3,5-triazine, quinoxaline, phthalazine, pyrimidine, pyridazine or 2-alkylsulfonyl benzo-thiazole as heterocyclic parent species.<br>
The following heterocyclic radicals are particularly suitable:<br><br><br><br>
where Z2 and Hal are each as defined above, U1  is hydrogen or nitro, and<br>
U2  and U3 are independently hydrogen or C1-C6-alkyl with or without substitution by hydroxyl, halogen, cyano, hydroxy-sulfonyl or a radical of the formula -S02-Y, where Y is as defined above, and in each case with or without interruption by 1 or 2 oxygen atoms in ether function, imino or C1-C4-alkylimino groups,<br>
or U2 and U3 are together with the linking nitrogen atom pyrrolidinyl, piperidinyl, morpholinyl, piperazinyl or N- (C1-C4-alkyl)piperazinyl, or U2 can also be a radical of the formula<br>
and the rings B1 and B2 may each be mono- or disubstituted by hydroxysulfonyl and/or benzofused, and the ring B2 may independently be mono- or disubstituted by chlorine, nitro, C1-C4-alkyl, C1-C4-alkoxy, cyano, carboxyl, acetylamino, hydroxysulfonylmethyl or a radical of the formula CH2-SO2-Y, S02-Y, NH-CO-Y or NU2-CO-NU2-L5-S02-Y, where Y and U2 are each as defined above and L5 is C2-Ce-alkylene with or without substitution by hydroxyl, chlorine, cyano, carboxyl, C1-C4-alkoxycarbonyl, C1-C4-alkanoyloxy or sulfato with or without interruption by 1 or 2 oxygen atoms in ether function or imino or C1-C4-alkylimino groups.<br>
Fiber-reactive groups of the aliphatic series include for example acryloyl, mono-, di- or trichloroacryloyl, mono-, di- or tri-bromoacryloyl, -C0-CC1=CH-C00H, -C0-CH=CC1-C00H, 2-chloro-propionyl, 1,2-dichloropropionyl, 1,2-dibromopropionyl, 3-phenyl-sulfonylpropionyl, 3-methylsulfonylpropionyl, 2-sulfatoethyl-aminosulfonyl, 2-chloro-2,3,3-trifluorocyclobutylcarbonyl, 2,2,3, 3-tetrafluorocyclobutylcarbonyl, 2,2,3,3-tetrafluorocyclo-butylsulfonyl, 2-(2,2,3,3-tetrafluorocyclobutyl)acryloyl, 1- or 2-alkyl- or 1- or 2-arylsulfonylacryloyl, such as 1- or 2-methyl-sulfonylacryloyl, or a radical of the formula SO2-Y, CONH-L6-S02-Y or NHCONH-L6-S02-Y, where Y is as defined above and L6 is C1-C4-alkylene or phenylene.<br>
W in the formula I is in case 1) for example the radical of a coupling component, of a monoazo dye or additionally, when b=0, of a disazo dye which optionally has additional reactive groups. In this case, the fiber-reactive group E is linked to the radical W via an azo bridge (-N=N-). If W is a monoazo dye, its coupling<br><br>
component will be linked to the fiber-reactive group E via an azo bridge. Correspondingly, if w is a disazo dye, coupling takes place onto its diazo component.<br>
Dyes of this class conform for example to the formula Ilia, Illb, IIIc or Hid<br>
(E-N=N-)aK	(Hla)<br>
E-N=N-K-N=N-D	(IIlb)<br>
E-N=N-(D-N=N-K)-N=N-D      (IIIC)<br>
(E-N=N-) 2 (K-N=N-D)	(Hid)<br>
where K is the radical of a coupling component, D is the radical of a diazo component/ a is 1 or 2 and E is as defined above. If, in the formulae Ilia and Hid, the radical E occurs twice (a=2), then the radicals E can be either identical or different from each other. Similarly, the radicals D can be identical or different in formula IIIc.<br>
Useful dyes of this class are for example water-soluble azo dyes, especially monoazo dyes of the formula Ilia (a=l), disazo dyes of the formula Ilia (a=2) or Illb or trisazo dyes of the formulae IIIc or Hid which have hydroxysulfonyl and/or carboxyl groups. Important coupling components HK are derived for example from compounds of the benzene, naphthalene, pyrazole, pyridine, pyrimidine, indole or N-arylacetoacetamide series.<br>
Important diazo components D-NH2 are derived for example from compounds of the aniline or aminonaphthalene series. It is possible to use them as coupling components at the same time. So the terms diazo and coupling component are not mandatory for the preparative process, but merely reflect one possible process.<br>
W in the formula I is further for example, in case 2), the optionally metallized radical of an azo dye. Suitable azo dyes from which such radicals are derived are known per se and have been described in large numbers, for example in K. Venkataraman, The Chemistry of Synthetic Dyes, Vol. VI, Academic Press, New York, London, 1972. The azo dyes conform to the formula V<br>
D	N= N	K(	N= N	D)i   (V) ,<br>
where D is the radical of a diazo component, K is the radical of a coupling component and 1 is 0 or 1 and where, when 1 is 1, the radicals D are identical or different from each other.<br><br>
Useful dyes from which the radical W is derived include for example water-soluble azo dyes, especially monoazo dyes of the formula V (1 = 0) which may have hydroxysulfonyl and/or carboxyl groups-<br>
The radical W is preferably derived from unmetallized azo dyes, especially from those containing sulfonic acid and/or carboxyl groups, of which those having from 1 to 6 sulfonic acid groups are particularly to be emphasized.<br>
Important azo dyes from which the radical W is derived not only in case 1) but also in case 2) are for example those of the phenyl—azo-iaphthalene, phenyl—azo—1—phenylpyrazol-5—one, phenyl— azoHoenzene, naphthyl-azo-benzene, phenyl-azo-aminonaphthalene, naphthyl—azo-naphthalene, naphthyl-azo—l-phenylpyrazol-5-one, phenyl-azo-pyridone, pheriyl-azo—aminopyridine, naphthyl—azo-pyri-done, naphthyl-azo-aminopyridine or stilbyl—azo-benzene series.<br>
Radicals D1 of diazo components of the aniline or aminonaphthalene series which do not bear fiber-reactive groups are derived for example from amines of the formulae Vla-f<br><br><br>

The novel reactive dyes of the formula I can be prepared in a<br>
conventional manner,<br>

H2N-E	(XXIII),<br>
where E is as defined above, in a conventional manner with a coupling component of the formula XXIV<br>

where W2 is the radical of a chromophore which optionally has further fiber-reactive groups and is derived from and optionally metallized mono- or disazo dye, a triphendioxazine, an anthra-quinone, a metallized formazan or a metallized phthalocyanine and G14 is an amino radical of the formula NHZ1 or an acid halide radical of the formula COHal or SC^Hal, where Z1 and Hal are each as defined above, can be reacted with a fiber-reactive compound of the formula XXVI<br><br>

(XXVI),<br><br>
where E is as defined above and G15 is one of the radicals G14, with the proviso that, in either case, an amine reacts with an<br>
acid halide.<br>
When L1 (case 2) is a urea bridge or a triazine radical, the synthesis steps customary with these classes of compounds are included as well.<br>
It is also possible to start from such precursors of compounds of the formula XXV as form part of the later chromophore and to react them first with the fiber-reactive compound XXVI and then co construct the chromophore radical W2.<br>
when b in the formula I is 1, the bridge chromophores can be obtained for example by either bridging the finished individual chromophores or else by first bridging suitable intermediates and then constructing the respective chromophoric systems.<br>
The preparation of the fiber-reactive compounds of the formulae xxvi and XXIII is known per se and is described for example in DE-A-195 28 189.<br>
in this way it is possible to start from intermediates suitable for constructing the heterocycle underlying the radical Het.<br>
This is more particularly described in the following synthetic schemes where L3, Y, A1 and A2 are each as defined above and Hal is chlorine or bromine for the case where Het is derived from 1,2,4-oxadiazole:<br><br><br><br>
The two heterocyclic intermediates XXVII and XXVIII are subsequently subjected to reactions, carried out in a conventional manner in any order, whereby the nitro group is reduced to an amino group, the sulfide is oxidized to sulfone and the hydroxy-ethyl group is converted into an alkali-detachable group.<br>
The novel reactive dyes of the formula I are advantageously useful for dyeing or printing hydroxyl-containing or nitrogenous organic substrates. Such substrates include for example leather or fiber material comprising predominantly natural or synthetic polyamides or natural or regenerated cellulose. The novel dyes are preferably useful for dyeing and printing textile material based on wool or in particular cotton.<br>
Substrates based on cellulose in particular are dyed with a very high yield of fixation in strong shades which possess very good lightfastness and also excellent wetfastness properties, such as wash, chlorine bleach, peroxide bleach, alkali, seawater or perspiration fastness.<br>

To maintain the stated temperature range, the reaction had to be cooled with ice-water from time to time.<br><br>
After cooling, excess hydrogen peroxide was destroyed with sodium dithionite and the solvent was distilled off under reduced pressure. The oily residue was triturated with 200 ml of acetone and the precipitate was filtered off. The filtrate was concentrated to dryness under reduced pressure to leave 405 g of a viscid oil having a 3-(2-hydroxyethylsulfonyl)-propionitrile content of 86.4 % (85.8 % of theory).<br><br>
b)	3-(2-Hydroxyethylsulfonyl)propionamide oxime<br>
To a solution of 163 g (1.00 mol) of the compound described under a) and 69.5 g (1.00 mol) of hydroxylammonium chloride in 1 liter of methanol were added 190 ml (1.00 mol) of a 30 % strength by weight solution of sodium methoxide in methanol. The reaction mixture was refluxed for 6 h. After cooling, the precipitate was filtered off with suction and- dried at 50°C under reduced pressure to leave 151 g of a light brown microcrystalline powder having a 3-(2-hydroxyethylsulfonyl)-propionamide oxime content of 71.4 % (55.0 % of theory).<br><br>
c)	5-(2'-Aminophenyl)-3-[2-(2-hydroxyethylsulfonyl)ethyl]-1,2,4-<br>
oxadiazole<br>
A solution, heated to 50°C, in 1 liter of 1-methoxy-2-propanol of 98.1 g (0.50 mol) of the compound described under b) was slowly admixed with 81.6 g (0.50 mol) of isatoic anhydride and, after the evolution of gas had ceased, refluxed for 6 h. The solvent was then distilled off under reduced pressure, the residue was covered with isopropanol and the resulting precipitate was filtered off with suction. Yield: 76.8 g (51.7 % of theory) of a beige powder, melting point 118 - 119°C, of the formula<br><br><br>

After heating at 60°C for 8 h, the reaction solution was poured onto ice, the pH was adjusted to pH 4-5 with sodium bicarbonate, and the product was salted out with 500 g of potassium chloride to afford 95.3 g of 5-(2'-amino-5'-sulfophenyl)-3-[2-(2-hydroxy-ethylsulfonyl)ethyl]-1,2,4-oxadiazole.<br>
The 3,5-disulfonated compound of the formula<br><br>
was obtained on dropwise addition of 65 %, rather than 24 %, strength by weight oleum at 10 - 15°C, stirring at 40°C for 2 h and 7 5°C for 6 h, pouring onto ice, adjustment of the pH to 5 with sodium bicarbonate, subsequent filtration of the resulting sodium sulfate and salting out with potassium chloride.<br><br>

After 2 hours' stirring at from 0 to 5°C, the small excess of nitrous acid was destroyed with amidosulfuric acid.<br>
To this solution were added at from 0 to 5°C 22 g (0.053 mol) of 2-amino-8-hydroxy-3,6-disulfonic acid and the reaction solution was maintained at pH 2.5 to 3 with sodium acetate.

The diazotization was carried out by adding 30 ml of 30 % strength by weight hydrochloric acid and stirring at 0 - 5°C for one hour. After excess nitrous acid had been destroyed with amidosulfuric acid, the resulting dispersion of the diazonium salt was combined with a solution of l-(4,6-di-chloro-l,3,5-triazin-2-yl)amino-8-hydroxynaphthalene-4,6 -di-sulfonic acid, prepared as follows:<br>
A solution of 36.6 g of the disodium salt of K-acid and 25 g of sodium formate in 150 ml of water was added with thorough stirring to an ice-cold dispersion of 18.5 g of cyanuric chloride, 0.1 g of a dispersant, 1 ml of 30 % strength by weight hydrochloric acid and 200 ml of ice-water, and the mixture was stirred at 5 - 10°C and pH 1 for 2 h until the reaction had ended.<br>
The coupling reaction was completed by buffering with sodium acetate solution (pH about 3) and 30 minutes' stirring at 10 - 15°C.<br>
The dispersion of the resulting dichlorotriazinylazo dye was then admixed with 34.1 g of the monosodium salt of H-acid and adjusted to pH 5 - 5.5 by sprinkling with sodium bicarbonate, the temperature rising to 20°C. After 2 hours' stirring at 20 - 25°C while the abovementioned pH was maintained, the reaction had ended and the dye of the formula<br><br>
was completely precipitated by means of potassium chloride, filtered off with suction and washed with 5 % strength by weight aqueous potassium chloride solution.<br><br>
b)  0.05 mol of the dye described under a) was admixed with the fiber-reactive moiety compound described under Example lc). Buffering with sodium acetate to a pH of 5 completed the coupling reaction. The dye of the formula<br><br>
was precipitated with 130 g of potassium chloride, filtered off with suction, washed with 20 % strength by weight aqueous potassium chloride solution and dried at 40°C under reduced pressure.<br>
The dye dyes cotton, both by the hot exhaust method and the cold pad-batch method, in bright neutral reds having very high color strength with a very high degree of fixation and high insensitivity to temperature fluctuations.<br>
Example 5.2<br>
The sulfatoethylsulfonylaniline used in Example 5.1a) was replaced with an equivalent amount of the fiber-reactive moiety compound described under Example lc) and then the method of Example 5.1b) was followed, affording the dye of the formula<br><br>
The methods of Examples 5.1 and 5.2 also afford the following dyes shown in Table 5:<br><br><br><br><br><br>

were suspended in 300 ml of water and 30 ml of  30 % strength by weight hydrochloric acid and, after cooling with 100 g of ice, diazotized with 30 ml of 3.33N aqueous sodium nitrite solution- After 30 minutes' stirring at 0 - 5°C, the small excess of nitrous acid was destroyed with amidosulfuric acid and the diazonium salt solution was combined with a solution of 10.7 g of m-toluidine in 100 ml of water and 10 ml of 30 % strength by weight hydrochloric acid. Saturated sodium acetate solution was used to set a pH of 1.5 and maintain it at room temperature overnight. The hydrochloride of the dye of the formula<br><br>
was filtered off with suction, washed with water rendered acid with hydrochloric acid and dried at 60°C under reduced pressure.<br>
b)  32 g of the compound described under a) were stirred in 200 g of concentrated sulfuric acid and held at 40°C for 3 h until the sulfuric ester had formed to a substantial extent. 90 g of 65 % strength by weight oleum and two hours' stirring at 80°C brought about sulfonation. The resulting dye of the formula<br><br><br>
was stirred out onto 1000 g of ice and filtered off with suction.<br>
c)  The aqueous filter residue of Example 7.1b) which comprised sulfuric acid, was suspended in 150 ml of water and admixed • at 10 - 15°C with 11 ml of 3.33N aqueous sodium nitrite solution.

in 150 ml of water. Buffering with aqueous sodium acetate solution to pH 5 brought about the coupling to form the dye of the formula<br><br>
which was isolated as sodium salt. It dyes cotton in bright tile red shades having a good fastness profile.<br>
Example 8.1<br>
The solution of the reaction product of cyanuric chloride with H-acid (as described under 4.1a)) was coupled at pH 5 with 5-(2'-aminophenyl)-3-[2-(2-sulfatoethyl-)sulfonylethyl]-1, 2,4-oxadiazole diazotized as per Example 5.1.

hydrochloric acid and diazotized with 60 ml of 3.33N aqueous<br>
sodium nitrite solution at 0 - 5°C. After two hours' stirring<br>
at 0 - 5°C, the small nitrite excess was removed with amido-<br>
sulfuric acid, and 39.7 g of orthanilic acid were added for<br>
coupling. The coupling took place at pH 3 through addition of<br>
solid sodium acetate. 300 g of sodium chloride were added to<br>
obtain 92 g of a yellow dye of the formula<br><br>
b)	37.7 g of 5-(2'-aminophenyl)-3-[2-(2-sulfatoethylsulfonyl)-<br>
ethyl]-1,2,4-oxadiazole were suspended in 400 ml of ice-water<br>
and 40 ml of 30 % strength by weight hydrochloric acid and<br>
diazotized with 30 ml of 3.33N aqueous sodium nitrite<br>
solution at 0 - 5°C. After two hours' stirring at 0 - 5°C,<br>
a slight nitrite excess was removed with amidosulfuric acid, and 25,7 g of 2-amino-5-hydroxynaphthalene-7-sulfonic acid were added. Coupling took place at pH 2.5 - 3 through addition of solid sodium acetate. After stirring overnight, the pH was adjusted to 3.5 with sodium acetate, and the product was filtered off, affording 128 g of a red monoazo dye of the formula<br><br>
c)	92 g of the monoazo dye prepared under 10.1a) were suspended<br>
in 500 ml of ice-water and 20 ml of 30 % strength by weight<br>
hydrochloric acid and diazotized with 15 ml of 3.33N aqueous<br>
sodium nitrite solution. After two hours' stirring at 0 -<br>
5°C, the small nitrite excess was removed with amidosulfuric<br>
acid. The resulting diazonium salt was admixed with 64 g of<br>
the monoazo dye prepared under b). Coupling took place at pH<br><br>
5-5.5 through addition of solid sodium acetate and sodium carbonate. 300 g of sodium chloride were added to obtain 10-2 g of a reddish brown trisazo dye.<br><br>
The trisazo dyes of Table 10 can be prepared similarly to Example 10.1. They dye cotton reddish brown from an alkaline bath and have a very good property profile.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
Example 11.1<br><br>

The pH was raised to 4.5 - 5.5 by addition of sodium carbonate, and then the reaction mixture was stirred at 0 - 5°C at the stated pH for 4 h until coupling was complete.<br>
Precipitation with 100 g of sodium chloride, filtration with suction and drying under reduced pressure led to 78 g of a greenish yellow electrolyte-comprising dye of the formula<br><br>
being obtained.<br>
The method of Example 11.1 also affords the dyes listed below in Table 11.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
