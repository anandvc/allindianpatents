				<td>METHODS AND APPARATUS FOR DETERMINING, COMMUNICATING AND USING INFORMATION WHICH CAN BE USED FOR INTERFERENCE CONTROL<br>
PURPOSES<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to wireless communications system and, more particularly, to method and apparatus for collecting, measuring, reporting and/or using information which can be used for interference control purposes in a wireless communications system.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
In a wireless multiple access communication system, wireless terminals contend for system resources in order to communicate with a common receiver over an uplink channel. An example of this situation is the uplink channel in a cellular wireless system, in which wireless terminals transmit to a base station receiver. When a wireless terminal transmits on the uplink channel, it typically causes interference to the entire system, e.g., neighboring base station receivers. Since wireless terminals are distributed, controlling the interference generated by their transmission is a challenging problem.<br>
Many cellular wireless systems adopt simple strategies to control uplink interference. For example CDMA voice systems (e.g., IS-95) simply power control wireless terminals in such a manner that their signals are received at the base station receiver at approximately the same power. State-of-the-art CDMA systems such as lxRTT and lxEV-DO allow for wireless terminals to transmit at different rates, and be received at the base station at different powers. However, interference is controlled in a distributed manner which lowers the overall level of interference without precisely controlling those wireless terminals that are the worst sources of interference in the system.<br>
This existing body of interference-control approaches limits the uplink capacity of wireless systems.<br>
It would be useful if a base station could be provided with information that could be used in determining the amount of signal interference that will be created in neighboring cells when a transmission occurs and/or the amount of interference a wireless terminal is likely to encounter<br><br>
due to signal interference. It would be particularly desirable if information which can be used for interference determination purposes could be supplied by one or more wireless terminals to a base station.<br>

SUMMARY<br>
The present invention is directed to methods and apparatus for collecting, measuring, reporting and/or using information which can be used for interference control purposes.<br>
In accordance with the invention, wireless terminals, e.g., mobile nodes, measure signals transmitted from one or more base stations, e.g., base station sector transmitters. The measured<br><br>
signals may be, e.g., beacon signals and/or pilot signals. The beacon signals may be narrowband signals, e.g., a single tone. The beacon signals may have a duration of one, two or more symbol transmission time periods. However, other types of beacon signals may be used and the particular type of beacon signal is not critical to the invention. From the measured signals, the wireless terminal generates one or more gain ratios which provide information about the relative gain of the communications channels from different base station sectors to the wireless terminal. This information represents interference information since it provides information about the signal interference that will be caused by transmissions to other base station sectors relative to transmissions made to the base station sector to which the wireless terminal is attached.<br>
Based on the signal energy measurements and relative gains generated from the energy measures, reports are generated in accordance with the invention and sent to one or more base stations. The reports may be in a plurality of different formats and may provide information about the interference from one interfering base station or the interference caused by multiple interfering base stations. One format provides information about the interference which is caused be a single interfering base station sector transmitter relative to a base station sector to which the wireless terminal is connected. A base station may request from a wireless terminal a transmission of an interference report providing interference about a specific base station sector. This is done by the base station transmitting a request for a specific interference report to the wireless terminal. The request normally identifies the interfering BS sector for which the report is sought. The wireless terminal will respond to such a request by transmitting the requested report.<br>
In addition to responding to requests for specific interference reports, wireless terminals, in some embodiments, transmit interference reports generated in accordance with the invention according to a reporting schedule. In such embodiments, a base station having an active connection with a wireless terminal will receive interference reports on a predictable, e.g., predetermined, schedule.<br>
Depending on the embodiment, generation of gain ratios and/or reports may be a function of various factors indicative of relative transmission power levels used by different base station sectors and/or for different signals which may be measured. In this manner, signals which are transmitted at different power levels, e.g., pilots and beacon signals, can be measured<br><br>
and used in generating reliable relative channel gain estimates by taking into consideration the different relative transmission power levels of the various signals being measured.<br>
Numerous additional features, benefits and embodiments are described in the detailed description which follows.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
Methods and apparatus for collecting, reporting and using information which can be used for interference control purposes in accordance with the present invention will now be described. The methods and apparatus of the present invention are well suited for use with wireless multiple access, e.g., multi-user, communications systems. Such systems may be implemented as OFDM systems, CDMA systems or other types of wireless systems where signal interference from transmission from one or more transmitters, e.g., adjacent base stations, is of concern.<br>
An exemplary embodiment of the invention is described below in the context of a cellular wireless data communication system 100 of the present invention shown in Fig. 1. While an exemplary cellular wireless system is used for purposes of explaining the invention, the invention is broader in scope than the example and can be applied in general to many other wireless communication systems as well.<br>
In a wireless data communication system, the air link resource generally includes bandwidth, time or code. The air link resource that transports user data and/or voice traffic is called the traffic channel. Data is communicated over the traffic channel in traffic channel segments (traffic segments for short). Traffic segments may serve as the basic or minimum units of the available traffic channel resources. Downlink traffic segments transport data traffic from the base station to the wireless terminals, while uplink traffic segments transport data traffic from the wireless terminals to the base station. One exemplary system in which the present invention may be used is the spread spectrum OFDM (orthogonal frequency division multiplexing) multiple-access system in which, a traffic segment includes a number of frequency tones defined over a finite time interval.<br>
Figure 1 is an illustration of an exemplary wireless communications system 100, implemented in accordance with the present invention. Exemplary wireless communications<br><br>
system 100 includes a plurality of base stations (BSs): base station 1 102, base station M 114. Cell 1 104 is the wireless coverage area for base station 1 102, BS 1 102 communicates with a plurality of wireless terminals (WTs): WT(1) 106, WT(N) 108 located within cell 1 104. WT(1) 106, WT(N) 108 are coupled to BS 1 102 via wireless links 110, 112, respectively. Similarly, Cell M 116 is the wireless coverage area for base station Mil 4. BSM114 communicates with a plurality ofwireless terminals (WTs): WT(l') 118, WT(N') 120 located within cellM 116. WT(l') 118, WT(N') 120 are coupled to BSM 114 via wireless links 122, 124, respectively. WTs (106,108,118,120) may be mobile and/or stationary wireless communication devices. Mobile WTs, sometimes referred to as mobile nodes (MNs), may move throughout the system 100 and may communicate with the base station corresponding to the cell in which they are located. Region 134 is a boundary region between cell 1 104 and cell M 116. In the Fig. 1 system, the cells are shown as single sector cells. Multi-sectors cells are also possible and are supported. The transmitter of a base station sector can be identified based on transmitted information, e.g., beacon signals, which communicate abase station identifier and/or sector identifier.<br>
Network node 126 is coupled to BS 1 102 and BS M 114 via network links 128,130, respectively. Network node 126 is also coupled to other network nodes / Internet via network link 132. Network links 128,130, 132 maybe, e.g., fiber optic links. Network node 126, e.g., a router node, provides connectivity for WTs, e.g., WT(1) 106 to other nodes, e.g., other base stations, AAA server nodes, Home agents nodes, communication peers, e.g., WT(N'), 120, etc., located outside its currently located cell, e.g., cell 1 104.<br>
Figure 2 illustrates an exemplary base station 200, implemented in accordance with the present invention. Exemplary BS 200 may be a more detailed representation of any of the BSs, BS 1 102, BS M 114 of Figure 1. BS 200 includes a receiver 202, a transmitter 204, a processor, e.g., CPU, 206, an I/O interface 208, I/O devices 210, and a memory 212 coupled together via a bus 214 over which the various elements may interchange data and information. In addition, the base station 200 includes a receiver antenna 216 which is coupled to the receiver 202 and a transmitter antenna 218 which is coupled to transmitter 218. Transmitter antenna 218 is used for transmitting information, e.g., downlink traffic channel signals, beacon signals, pilot signals, assignment signals, interference report request messages, interference control indicator signals, etc., from BS 200 to WTs 300 (see Figure 3) while receiver antenna 216 is used for receiving<br><br>
information, e.g., uplink traffic channel signals, WT requests for resources, WT interference reports, etc., from WTs 300.<br>
The memory 212 includes routines 220 and data/information 224. The processor 206 executes the routines 220 and uses the data/information 224 stored in memory 212 to control the overall operation of the base station 200 and implement the methods of the present invention. I/O devices 210, e.g., displays, printers, keyboards, etc., display system information to a base station administrator and receive control and/or management input from the administrator. I/O interface 208 couples the base station 200 to a computer network, other network nodes, other base stations 200, and/or the Internet. Thus, via I/O interface 308 base stations 200 may exchange customer information and other data as well as synchronize the transmission of signals to WTs 300 if desired. In addition I/O interface 208 provides a high speed connection to the Internet allowing WT 300 users to receive and/or transmit information over the Internet via the base station 300. Receiver 202 processes signals received via receiver antenna 216 and extracts from the received signals the information content included therein. The extracted information, e.g., data and channel interference report information, is communicated to the processor 206 and stored in memory 212 via bus 214. Transmitter 204 transmits information, e.g., data, beacon signals, pilot signals, assignment signals, interference report request messages, interference control indicator signals, to WTs 300 via antenna 318.<br>
As mentioned above, the processor 206 controls the operation of the base station 200 under direction of routines 220 stored in memory 212.

The base station control routines 228 include a scheduler 230, a downlink broadcast signaling module 232, a WT report processing module 234, a report request module 236, and an interference indicator module 238. The report request module 236 can generate requests for specific interference reports concerning a particular BS sector identified in the report request. Generated report requests are transmitted to one or more wireless terminals when the BS seeks interference information at a time other than that provided for by a predetermined or fixed reporting schedule, Data/Information 224 includes downlink broadcast reference signal information 240, wireless terminal data/information 241, uplink traffic channel information 246, interference report request information messages 248, and interference control indicator signals 250.<br><br>
Downlink broadcast reference signal information 240 includes beacon signal information 252, pilot signal information 254, and assignment signal information 256. Beacon signals are relatively high power OFDM broadcast signals in which the transmitter power is concentrated on one or a few tones for a short duration, e.g., one symbol time. Beacon signal information 252 includes identification information 258 and power level information 260. Beacon identification information 258 may include information used to identify and associate the beacon signal with specific BS 200, e.g., a specific tone or set of tones which comprise the beacon signal at a specific time in a repetitive downlink transmission interval or cycle. Beacon power level information 260 includes information defining the power level at which the beacon signal is transmitted. Pilot signals may include known signals broadcast to WTs at moderately high power levels, e.g., above ordinary signaling levels, which are typically used for identifying a base station, synchronizing with a base station, and obtaining a channel estimate. Pilot signal information 254 includes identification information 262 and power level information 264. Pilot identification information 262 includes information used to identify and associate the pilot signals with specific base station 200. Pilot power level information 264 includes information defining the power level at which the pilot signals are transmitted. Various signals providing information about signal transmission power levels, e.g., pilot and beacon signal transmission pilot levels, may be broadcast for use by wireless terminals in determining gain ratios and/or interference reports. Assignment signals includes broadcast uplink and downlink traffic channel segment assignment signals transmitted typically at power levels above ordinary signaling levels so as to reach WTs within its cell which have poor channel quality conditions. Assignment signaling information 256 includes identification information 266 and power level information 268. Assignment signaling identification information 266 includes information associating specific tones at specific times in the downlink timing cycle with assignments for the specific BS 200. Assignment power level information 268 includes information defining the power level at which the assignment signals are transmitted.<br>
Wireless terminal data/information 240 includes a plurality of sets of WT data/information, WT 1 information 242, WT N info 244. WT 1 information 242 includes data 270, terminal identification information 272, interference cost report information 274, requested uplink traffic segments 276, and assigned uplink traffic segments 278. Data 270 includes user data associated with WT 1, e.g., data and information received from WT1 intended to be communicated by BS 200 either directly or indirectly to a peer node of WT1, e.g., WT N, in which WT 1 is participating in a communications session. Data 270 also includes received data<br><br>
and information originally sourced from a peer node of WT 1, e.g., WT N. Terminal identification information 272 includes a BS assigned identifier associating WT 1 used by the BS to identify WT 1. Interference cost report information 274 includes information which has been forwarded in a feedback report from WT 1 to BS 200 identifying interference costs of WT 1 transmitting uplink signaling to the communications system. Requested uplink traffic segments 276 include requests from WT1 for uplink traffic segments which are allocated by the BS scheduler 230, e.g., number, type, and/or time constraint information. Assigned uplink traffic segments 278 includes information identifying the uplink traffic segments which have been assigned by the scheduler 230 to WT 1.<br>
Uplink traffic channel information 246 includes a plurality of uplink traffic channel segment information sets including information on the segments that may be assigned by BS scheduler 230 to WTs requesting uplink air link resources. Uplink traffic channel information 246 includes channel segment 1 information 280 and channel segment N information 282. Channel segment 1 information 280 includes type information 284, power level information 286, definition information 288, and assignment information 290. Type information 284 includes information defining the characteristics of the segment 1, e.g., the frequency and time extent of the segment. For example, the BS may support multiple types of uplink segments, e.g., a segment with a large bandwidth but a short time durations and a segment with a small bandwidth but a long time duration. Power level information 286 includes information defining the specified power level at which the WT is to transmit when using uplink segment 1. Definition information 288 includes information defining specific frequencies or tones and specific times which constitute uplink traffic channel segment 1. Assignment information 290 includes assignment information associated with uplink traffic segment 1, e.g., the identifier of the WT being assigned the uplink traffic channel segment 1, a coding and/or a modulation scheme to be used in uplink traffic channel segment 1.<br>
Interference report request information messages 248, used in some embodiments, are messages to be transmitted, e.g., as a broadcast messages or as messages directed to specific WTs. The by BS 200 may transmit to WTs 300 on a common control channel instructing the WTs to determine and report the interference information with respect to a particular base station transmitter, e.g., base station sector transmitter, in the communications system. Interference report request information messages 248 normally include base station transmitter identification information 292 which identifies the particular base station sector being currently<br><br>
designated for the interference report. As discussed above, some base stations are implemented as single sector base stations. Over time BS 200 may change base station identification information 292 to correspond to each of the neighboring transmitters and thereby obtain interference information about multiple neighbors.<br>
Interference control indicator signals 250, used in some embodiments, e.g., where at least some of the uplink traffic segments are not explicitly assigned by the base station, are signals broadcast by BS 200 to WTs 300 to control, in terms of interference, which WTs may use uplink traffic segments. For example, a multi-level variable may be used where each level indicates how tightly the BS 200 would like to control interference. WTs 300 which receive this signal can use this signal in combination with their own measured interference to determine whether or not the WT 300 is allowed to use the uplink traffic segments being controlled.<br>
Communication routines 226 implement the various communications protocols used by the BS 200 and control overall transmission of user data. Base station control routines 228 ' control the operation of the I/O devices, I/O interface 208, receiver 202, transmitter 204, and controls the operation of the BS 200 to implement the methods of the present invention. Scheduler 230 allocates uplink traffic segments under its control to WTs 300 based upon a number of constraints: power requirement of the segment, transmit power capacity of the WT, and interference cost to the system. Thus, the scheduler 230 may, and often does, use information from received interference reports when scheduling downlink transmissions. Downlink broadcast signaling module 232 uses the data/information 2224 including the downlink broadcast reference signal information 240 to generate and transmits broadcast signals such as beacons, pilot signals, assignments signals, and/or other common control signal transmitted at known power levels which may be used by WTs 300 in determining downlink channel quality and uplink interference levels. WT interference report processing module 234 uses the data/information 240 including the interference cost report information 274 obtained from the WTs 300 to process, correlate, and forward uplink interference information to the scheduler 230. The report request module 236, used in some embodiments, generates a sequence of interference report request messages 248 to request a sequence of uplink interference reports, each report corresponding to one of its adjacent base stations. Interference indicator module 238, used in some embodiments, generates (multi-level) interference control indicator signals 250 which are transmitted to the WTs 300 to control access to some uplink traffic channel segments which a<br><br>

The first cell 404 includes a first base station including a first base station sector transmitter (BSSo) 410 and a wireless terminal 420 which is connected to BSSo 410. The second cell 406 includes a station base station including a second base station sector transmitter (BSSi) 412. The third cell 408 includes a third station base station including a third base station sector transmitter (BSS2) 414. As can be seen, signals transmitted between BSSo and the WT 420 are subjected to a channel gain go-Signals transmitted between BSSi and the WT 420 are subjected to a channel gain gi. Signals transmitted between BSS2 and the WT 420 are subjected to a channel gain g2.<br><br>
Assume that the WT is connected to BSSo 410 using BSSo 410 as its attachment point. A gain ratio Gj - ratio of the channel gain from the BSSi to the WT to the channel gain from the BSSo to which the WT 420 is connected. That is:<br>
Gi = gi/go<br>
Assuming that beacon signals are transmitted from the first, second and third BSSs at the same power level, the received power (PB) of the beacon signals received from the base stations BSSo, BSSi, BSS2 can be used to determine the gain ratio's as follows:<br>
Go = go/go = 1 = PB0/PB0 Gi=gi/go = l=PBi/PB0<br>
G2 = gz/go = 1 = PB2/PB0<br>
The following discussion of the invention will focus on the operation of the uplink traffic channel in accordance with the invention. In the exemplary system, the traffic segments that constitute the uplink traffic channel may be defined over different frequency and time extents in order to suit a broad class of wireless terminals that are operating over a diverse set of wireless channels and with different device constraints. Figure 6 is a graph 100A of frequency on the vertical axis 102 A vs time on the horizontal axis 104A. 6 illustrates two kinds of traffic segments in the uplink traffic channel. Traffic segment denoted A 106A occupies twice the frequency extent of the traffic segment denoted B 108 A. The traffic segments in the uplink traffic channel can be shared dynamically among the wireless terminals that are communicating with the base station. A scheduling module that is part of the base station can rapidly assign the traffic channel segments to different users according to their traffic needs, device constraints and channel conditions, which may be time varying in general. The uplink traffic channel is thus effectively shared and dynamically allocated among different users on a segment-by-segment basis. The dynamic allocation of traffic segments is illustrated in Figure 6A in which segment A is assigned to user #1 by the base station scheduler and segment B is assigned to user #2.<br><br>
In the exemplary system, the assignment information of traffic channel segments is transported in the assignment channel, which includes a series of assignment segments. Each traffic segment is associated with a corresponding unique assignment segment that conveys the assignment information that may include the identifier of the wireless terminal and also the coding and modulation scheme to be used in that traffic segment. Figure 7 is a graph 200A of frequency on the vertical axis 202A vs. time on the horizontal axis 204A. Fig. 7 shows two assignment segments, A' 206A and B' 208 A, which convey the assignment information of the uplink traffic segments A 210A and B 212A, respectively. The assignment channel is a shared channel resource. The wireless terminals receive the assignment information conveyed in the assignment channel and then transmit on the uplink traffic channel segments according to the assignment information.<br>
The base station scheduler 230 allocates traffic segments based on a number of considerations. One constraint is that the transmit power requirement of the traffic channel should not exceed the transmit power capability of the wireless terminal. Hence, wireless terminals that are operating over weaker uplink channels may be allocated traffic segments that occupy a narrower frequency extent in the exemplary system in order that the instantaneous power requirements are not severely constraining. Similarly, wireless terminals that generate a greater amount of interference may also be allocated traffic segments that include a smaller frequency extent in order to reduce the impact of the instantaneous interference generated by them. In accordance with the invention, the total interference is controlled by scheduling the transmission of the wireless terminals on the basis of their interference costs to the system, which are defined in the following.<br>
In accordance with the invention, the wireless terminals determine their interference costs to the system from the received downlink broadcast signals. In one embodiment, the wireless terminals report their interference costs to the base station, in the form of interference reports, which then makes uplink scheduling decisions to control uplink interference. In another embodiment, the base station broadcasts an interference control indicator, and the wireless terminals compare their interference costs with the received indicator to determine their uplink transmission resources in an appropriate manner, e.g., mobiles have uplink transmission costs below a level indicated by the control indicator may transmit while mobiles with interference costs exceeding the cost level indicated by the control indicator will refrain from transmitting.<br><br><br><br><br>
Method of determining interference costs in some embodiments will now be described. In one exemplary embodiment, each base station 102,114 in the exemplary system 100 broadcasts periodic reference signals at high power that the wireless terminals can detect and decode. The reference signals include beacons, pilots, or other common control signals. The reference signals may have a unique pattern that serves to identify the cell and the sector of the base station.<br>
In the exemplary OFDM system 100, a beacon or pilot signal can be used as the reference signals. A beacon signal is a special OFDM symbol in which most of the transmission power is concentrated on a small number of tones. The frequency location of those high-power tones indicates the identifier of the base station. A pilot signal can have a special hopping pattern, which also uniquely specifies the identifier of the base station 102. Thus, a base station sector can be identified in the exemplary system from beacon and/or pilot signals.<br>
In a CDMA system, a pilot signal can be used as the reference signal. In the IS-95 system, for example, a pilot is a known spreading sequence with a particular time offset as the identifier of the base station.<br>
While the exemplary system 100 described above uses beacon or pilot signals to provide a reference signal for path loss estimation, the invention is applicable in a wide variety of systems that may use other techniques to provide reference signals.<br>
The reference signals are transmitted at known powers. Different reference signals may be transmitted at different powers. Different base stations 102,114 may use different power<br><br>
levels for the same type of reference signals as long as these powers are known to the mobile terminals.<br>
The wireless terminal 106 first receives the reference signals to get the identifier of the base station 102. Then, the wireless terminal 106 measures the received power of the reference signals, and calculates fhe channel gain from the base station 102 to the wireless terminal 106. Note that at a given location, the wireless terminal may be able to receive the reference signals from multiple base stations 102,114. On the other hand, the wireless terminal may not be able to receive the reference signals from all the base stations in the entire system. In the exemplary system, wireless terminal m0 monitors Go,o for its connected base station B0, and Go,k for base<br>
station 2?A if it can receive the corresponding reference signal. Therefore, wireless terminal m0<br>
maintains an array of interference costs {ro,k} for the set of base stations whose reference signals it can receive<br>
Note that the wireless terminal 106 can derive the interference costs by combining the estimation from multiple reference signals. For example, in the exemplary OFDM system 100, the wireless terminal 106 may use both beacons and pilots to arrive at the estimation of {ro,k} •<br>
The information of interference costs {ro,k} is to be used to control the uplink interference and increase overall system capacity. The uplink traffic channels can be used in two modes and the following describes the use of interference costs in both modes.<br>
It should be pointed out that the wireless terminals 106,108 measured the channel gain information from the downlink reference signals, while the interference are a measure of the costs the interference will have in terms of impact on the uplink. The channel gains of the downlink and the uplink between a wireless terminal 106 and a base station 102 may not be same at all times. To remove the effect of short-term, the estimates of the channel gains from the downlink reference signals may, and in some embodiments are, averaged (using a form of lowpass filtering for example) to obtain the estimates of interference costs {ro,k}-<br>
Use of determined Interference Costs in a Scheduled Mode of operation will now be discussed. In one particular exemplary mode of operation, each of the uplink traffic segments are explicitly assigned by the base station so that one uplink traffic segment is only used by at<br><br>
most one wireless terminal. In the exemplary UJtvDM system, as tne tramc segments are orthogonal with each other, there is normally no intracell interference in an uplink traffic segment in this mode.<br>
To facilitate scheduling at the base station 102, in accordance with the invention, each wireless terminal 206,108 sends to the base station 102, which the wireless terminal 106 is connected to, a sequence of interference reports. The reports, in some embodiments are indicative of the calculated interference costs {ro,k}. In an extreme case, a report is a control message that includes the entire array of interference costs {ro,k}- To reduce the signaling overhead, however, in a preferred embodiment only a quantized version of the array {ro,k} is transmitted. There are a number of ways to quantize {ro,k}, as listed below.<br>
•	Report ro,totai&gt; which is the sum of all {ro^c}.<br>
•	Report the maximum of {ro,k} and the index k associated with the maximum.<br>
•	Report {ro,k} one-by-one, and the associated index k, periodically.<br>
•	Use a small number of levels to report ro,k. For example, two levels to indicate whether ro,k is strong or weak.<br>
After receiving the one or more interference reports, the base station schedules, e.g., assigns, the traffic segments as a function of the interference information. One scheduling policy is to restrict the total interference produced by all scheduled wireless terminals to a predetermined threshold. Another scheduling policy is categorize the wireless terminals according to their reported {ro,k} to several groups such that the group with large interference costs is preferably assigned traffic segments that include a smaller frequency extent in order to reduce the impact of the instantaneous interference generated.<br>
Consider one embodiment in which each base station 102 is aware of its neighbor set, i.e., the set of base stations 114, etc. that are determined to be neighbors from the perspective of interference. In a basic embodiment, the base 'station 102 just attempts to control the total interference to the neighboring base stations. The basic embodiment may be coarse in the sense that almost all the interference may be directed to a particular one of the neighboring base stations (cell X), e.g., because all the scheduled wireless terminals may be close to cell X. In this case, cell X experiences severe interference at this time instant At another time instant, the<br><br>
interference may be concentrated on a different neighboring base station, in which case cell X experiences little interference. Hence, in the above embodiment of total interference control, the interference to a particular neighboring base station may have large variation. In order to avoid destabilizing the intercell interference, the base station 102 may have to leave sufficient margin in the total generated interference to compensate the large variation.<br>
In an enhanced embodiment, fhe base station 102 broadcasts a message on a common control channel instructing the wireless terminals 106,108 to determine and report the interference cost with respect to a particular base station Bk. Thus, the wireless terminals, m},<br>
j=0,1,2,... will send the reports of r,^. Over time, the base station 102 repeats this process for each member of its neighbor set and determines the set of wireless terminals 106, 108 that interfere with each of the base stations. Once this categorization is complete, the base station 102 can simultaneously allocate uplink traffic segments to a subset of wireless terminals 106, 108 that interfere with different base stations, thereby reducing the variation of the interference directed to any particular base station. Advantageously, because the interference has less variation, the base station 102 may allow greater total interference to be generated without severely impacting the system stability, thus increasing the system capacity. Wireless terminals 106,108 in the interior of the cell 104 cause negligible interference to neighboring base stations 114 and therefore may be scheduled at any time.<br>
Use of Interference Costs in a Non-scheduled Mode of operation used in some but not necessarily all implementations will now be discussed.<br>
In this non-scheduled mode, each of the uplink traffic segments are not explicitly assigned by the base station 102. As a result, one uplink traffic segment may be used by multiple wireless terminals 106,108. In a CDMA system, as the uplink traffic segments are not orthogonal with each other, there is generally intracell interference in an uplink traffic segment in this mode.<br>
In this mode, each wireless terminal 106,108 makes its own scheduling decision of whether it is to use an uplink traffic segment and if so at what data rate and power. To help reduce excessive interference and maintain system stability, in accordance with the invention,<br><br>
the base station broadcasts the interference control indicator. Each wireless terminal 106,108 compares the reference levels with its interference costs and determines its scheduling decision.<br>
In one embodiment, the interference control indicator can be a multi-level variable and each level is to indicate how tightly the base station 102 would like to control the total interference. For example, when the lowest level is broadcasted, then all wireless terminals 106, 108 are allowed to use all the traffic channel segments at all rates. When the highest level is broadcasted, then only the wireless terminals 106,108 whose interference costs are very low can use the traffic channel segments. When a medium level is broadcasted, then the wireless terminals 106,108 whose interference costs are low can use all the traffic channel segments, preferably the traffic segments that include a larger frequency extent, while the wireless terminals 106,108 whose interference costs are high can only use the traffic segments that consist of a smaller frequency extent and at lower data rate. The base station 102 can dynamically change the broadcasted interference control level to control the amount of interference the wireless terminals 106,108 of the cell 104 generate to other base stations.<br>
