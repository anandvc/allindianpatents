				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates generally to a method for collecting operational data for analysis.<br>
Engine-generator sets are used to provide an on-site alternate source of electrical energy in hospitals, offices, data centers, factories, institutions, hotels and other buildings where an interruption to the utility source of power may cause unsafe situations or which may result in economic loss. In addition, engine-generator sets may be used to provide electrical energy in remote areas where there is no utility power available. Engine-generator sets may also be used as a distributed source of electrical energy to reduce a peak load on utility electrical generation systems during peak electrical demand periods, for example, during the summer.<br>
Engine-generator sets are usually closely monitored by operation technicians who are responsible for gathering operation data, such as temperatures and pressures, from instruments located on the engine-generator set. This data is normally obtained visually, and recorded using pens or pencils on notepads or forms.<br>
Typically the operation of an engine-generator set is controlled by an engine-generator controller. Known engine-generator controllers use microprocessors to control the operation of an engine-generator set and in some cases provide for, or have interfaces to, annunciation equipment, such as incandescent lights or light emitting diodes to display the status and operating condition of the engine-generator. Those known engine-generator controllers have limited communication capabilities through visual indicators and control and monitor the engine-generator set using hard-wired discrete control wiring. Thus, known engine-generator controllers are unable to communicate to other systems, for example, computers, actual operational parameters of the engine-generator set such as oil pressure, oil temperature, power quality for collection and analysis of engine-generator set performance. Therefore, data storage and retrieval to and from the engine-generator set is a tenuous task.<br>
Therefore, it would be desirable to closely monitor the operational status of the controller and the engine-generator sets without the need for pens and pencils, notepads or forms.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
A method for collecting operational data for analysis on a computer and downloading operational parameters to an engine-generator controller configured to control at least one engine-generator set using a personal digital assistant (PDA), said method comprising the steps of:<br>
-	transferring operational parameters from the computer to the PDA;<br>
-	downloading the operational parameters from the PDA to engine-generator<br>
controller preferably by the step of selecting an engine-generator controller to<br>
receive operational parameters and more preferably also comprises the step of<br>
verifying a successful download using a data checking mechanism uploading<br>
operational data from engine-generator controller to the PDA preferably by<br>
utilizing an engine-generator set identifier to verify that the correct engine<br>
generator set has received the operational parameters;<br>
displaying operational data in chronological order<br>
-	displaying operational data grouped by engine-generator set and<br>
transferring  operational data from the  PDA to the computer preferably by<br>
configuring   the  engine-generator  controller with   a  communications  service<br>
manager to enable communications with the personal digital assistant and<br>
configuring personal digital assistant to display enegine-generator set operational<br>
data<br>
The described method includes the steps of configuring the engine-generator controller with a service manager to enable communications with the PDA, configuring the PDA to display engine-generator set operational data and transferring operational parameters from the computer to the PDA. Further steps to the method include downloading the operational parameters from the PDA to the engine-generator controller, the upload of operational data from the 65 engine-generator controller to the PDA and the transfer of operational data from the PDA to the computer.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an electrical power generation system utilizing multiple engine-generators electrically linked together as the source of electrical energy;<br>
FIG. 2 is a diagram showing an engine-generator data collection system; and FIG. 3 is a diagram of a data transfer and analysis system.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Referring now to FIG. 1, there is illustrated a block diagram of an electrical power generation system 10 utilizing multiple engine-generator sets as a source of electrical energy. Each engine and electrical generator set comprises an engine, an electrical generator, a circuit breaker and a controller. In the embodiment shown in FIG. 1, n engine-generator sets are shown where the engines and generators are mechanically linked together. Circuit breakers electrically link the outputs' of the n generators. Controllers are configured to control operation of the engine-generator sets and monitor operational performance of the engine-generator sets, n engine-generator sets are shown in FIG. 1 to illustrate that depending on the required capacity of the electrical power generation system there may be more or less than three engine-generator sets within the system. Again referring to FIG. 1, a first engine-generator set includes a first engine 12, a first generator 14, a first circuit breaker 16 and a first engine-generator controller 18. A 30 second engine-generator set includes a second engine 22, a second generator 24, a second circuit breaker 26 and a second engine-generator controller 28. A third engine-generator set includes a third engine 32, a third generator 34, a third circuit breaker 36 and a third engine-generator controller 38. An nth engine-generator set includes an nth engine 42, an nth generator 44, an nth circuit breaker 46 and an nth engine-generator controller 48. The electrical energy of each engine-generator set is linked via circuit breakers to a common electrical bus 50 which is connected to a load bus for the distribution of electricity. In a typical engine-generator system as shown in FIG. 1, each engine-generator set is controlled and monitored using engine-generator controllers 18, 28, 38 and 48 as described below.<br>
As shown in FIG. 1, each engine-generator set is controlled by an engine-generator controller, for example controller 18. Controller 18 communicates engine-generator set operational data, for example, run-time hours, fuel consumed, oil temperature and oil pressure to a display and receives operational parameters data from an external interface, such as a keypad.<br>
FIG. 2 is a diagram according to one embodiment depicting an engine-generator data collection system 60. System 60 includes an operator 62 using a personal digital assistant (PDA) 64 to collect engine-generator set performance data or to configure an engine-generator set with operating parameters. As shown in system 60, PDA 64 interfaces to a visual engine-generator controller 66 via a communication interface 68. In the embodiment shown in FIG. 2, interface 68 is infra-red or another wireless interface. Visual engine-generator controller 66 communicates with an engine-generator set 70 via a bi-directional interface, in the embodiment shown, an RS-485 interface.<br>
Personal digital assistant (PDA) 64 is configured to upload operational data from engine-generator controller 66 and download operational parameters to engine-generator controller 66. In one embodiment, engine-generator controller 66 controls at least one engine-generator set 70. PDA 64 includes a central processing unit (CPU) and memory (both not shown) for processing instructions and operation of interface 68, a display 72 for displaying engine-generator set 5 data and a keypad 74 for entering instructions.<br>
PDA 64 is, in one embodiment, configured to select which controller 66 and further which engine-generator set 70 are to receive operational parameters for installations that include multiple controllers 66 and/or multiple engine- generators. In addition, PDA 64 is configured to verify a successful download to the engine-generator controller using a data checking mechanism, with a display to operator 62 on display 72 to communicate successful or unsuccessful downloads. One such data checking mechanism is an engine-generator set identifier utilized to verify that the correct engine-generator set has received the downloaded operational parameters.<br>
Other functions of PDA 64 include display of operational data uploaded from engine-generator controller 66 in chronological order on display 72. PDA 64 is further configured to allow selection of allowable ranges for the operational data and in one embodiment<br>
displays out of range operational data values in a color different than a color used for displaying data within range of operational data values. The multiple color schemes allows operator 62 to easily detect of out of range values. PDA 64 is also configurable to date and time stamp data uploaded from engine-generator controller 66. For communications between PDA 64 and engine-generator controller 66 to be enabled, engine-generator controller 66 is configured with a wireless communications service manager.<br>
FIG. 3 is a diagram of a data transfer and analysis system 80 according to the present invention. System 80 includes a PDA 64 as described above and a data storage and analysis subsystem 82, such as a computer configured to transfer engine-generator set operational and performance data to and from PDA 64. PDA 64 includes an interface enabling communication with subsystem 82. In one embodiment the interface is a standard RS-232 interface. Other embodiments include, but are not limited to wireless interfaces similar to interface 68 (shown in FIG. 2). Subsystem 82 is configured to store data downloaded from PDA 64 for analysis of engine-generator set performance. In addition, subsystem 82 can also transfer to PDA 64 operational parameters for eventual download to controllers 66 and engine-generators 70 (both shown in FIG. 2) as described above.<br>
PDA 64, described above, provides wireless communication capabilities for direct communications with engine-generator controllers. PDA 64 can communicate operational configuration parameters to the controllers, and retrieve operational data and status from engine-generator sets, through the controllers. Therefore, operational status of the controller and the engine-generator sets controlled can be closely monitored accurately, without the need for pens and pencils, notepads or forms.<br>
Use of such a system eliminates human error of known data gathering systems where data gathered is gathered in a manual fashion such as paper and pencil while providing operator interaction not seen in totally automated web-based systems, which sometimes leave an operator with uncertain conclusions as to machine performance when he or she does not actually view the machines on a regular basis.<br>
The term microprocessor, as used herein, refers to microprocessors, microcontrollers, reduced instruction set circuits (RISC), application specific integrated circuits (ASICs),<br>
logic circuits, and any other circuit or processor capable of executing the programs described above.<br>
While the invention has been described in terms of various specific embodiments, those skilled in the art will recognize that the invention can be practiced with modification within the spirit and scope of the claims.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
