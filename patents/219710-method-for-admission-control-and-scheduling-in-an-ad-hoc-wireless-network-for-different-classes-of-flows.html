FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention in general relates to the field of wireless communication and specifically to ad hoc wireless networks. More particularly, this invention relates to methods for admission control and scheduling in an ad hoc wireless network for different classes of flows.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
A schematic diagram of a typical wireless network is shown in Figure 1. Here, STA is the mobile station, also called as mobile terminal. The physical layer (PHY) and medium access control (MAC) standard for this type of networks are described in [1]. The basic access mechanism specifies two protocols of medium access, the point co-ordination function (PCF) and the distributed co-ordination function (DCF). The DCF medium access is the mode used for the ad hoc mode of operation and carrier sensing multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) is the multiple access mechanism. A four way handshake of request to send (RTS), clear to send (CTS), DATA and acknowledgement (ACK) is used for collision avoidance.<br>
The DCF MAC protocol does not provide any priority to any form of traffic, and hence, does not support quality of service (QoS). The IEEE 802.11e standard for QoS enhancements [2] specifies an enhanced DCF (EDCF) mode of operation defining 4 types of access categories (AC). The DCF inter-frame spacing (DIFS) time for clear channel assessment was modified to having a different arbitration inter-frame spacing (AIFS) for clear channel assessment corresponding to each access category. The 802.11e draft also specifies different values of the contention window size corresponding to different access categories, thereby providing the traffic with higher priority, a higher probability of obtaining a transmission opportunity (TXOP). The EDCF mode of operation also does not provide any QoS guarantees to the different classes of traffic. Different applications specify different QoS requirements which need to be provided to the users.<br><br>
A survey of the existing literature on performance evaluation and admission control in wireless ad hoc networks is as follows: In [3], Bianchi developed a discrete time Markov chain (DTMC) based approach to model the back-off stage and the back-off counter value. The DTMC model provided the throughput under saturated conditions. In [4], Carvalho and Aceves used the model developed by Bianchi in [3] to model the delay in single hop 802.11 networks. An expression for the mean and the variance for the "idle time" of a node was derived. The "idle time" was defined as the time a node spends in back-off. The authors in [4] also considered a saturated traffic model or an "always on" model (as in [3]).<br>
Admission control in the DCF and EDCF modes of WLAN have been studied in [5]-[7]. In [5], Kanodia et al presented a dynamic priority assignment algorithm in which each node exchanges the priority index of the packet currently under transmission and also the priority index at the head of line or the packet next to the one currently under transmission. The other nodes use this information to update their priority indices. The priority indices are then dynamically varied depending on the time spent by a packet in the system and the number of hops traversed. The mechanism provided in [5] is a modified back-off procedure based on the node priorities. In [6], Valee and Li applied the notion of service curves and used probing packets to predict the service curves. The service curves were obtained by the probing packets by using a moving average of the delay undergone by k waiting packets. However, the approach in [6] was a reactive approach because there was no effective prediction of the channel behavior. In [7], Kuo et al considered the EDCF mode of operation and presented an admission control policy to meet mean delay requirements. An estimate of the mean delay was made using aG/G/1 queuing model. It was found that the admission control procedure was highly conservative and resulted in under utilization of system resources. Also the procedure does not help in meeting delay bound requirements of real time traffic. In [8], Pong and Moors present an admission control approach for differentiated services in WLAN with the IEEE 802.11e EDCF. The contention window sizes were modified based on the throughput requirements of the flows and for each flow, the<br><br>
probability of the collision (and thus throughput degradation) was computed using an exponential weighted average technique.<br>
QoS provisioning in WLAN has beenstudied widely, some of which were mentioned above. While most studies in the current literature consider the infrastructure mode of operation, there are not many efficient mechanisms to provide QoS in the ad hoc mode. The existing literature on admission control in ad hoc networks provides means for exchanging information on the priorities associated with the packets currently under transmission and the packets in the head of line of the nodes. The priority indices of the packets are decided based on the access categories. There are very few studies on providing statistical QoS to packets belonging to different applications. Further, most studies consider the saturated traffic conditions and there are no efficient mechanisms that take into consideration the realistic on-off traffic models and that exploit the properties of session arrival processes.<br>
In the prior art, Distributed co-ordination function Medium Access Control (DCF MAC) does not support Quality of Service (QoS). Also admission control procedure in DCF and EDCF modes was highly conservative that resulted in under utilization of system resources. Based on the surveys of existing literature on performance evaluation and admission control of ad hoc wireless networks it is found that there are not many efficient mechanisms to provide QoS in ad hoc modes and works only for single hop links. There are very few studies that provide statistical QoS to packets belonging to different applications. Apart from that CSMA based wireless ad hoc networks, does not provide efficient scheme for per flow QoS. This invention proposes efficient mechanism to ensure per flow QoS and provides means for admission control and scheduling on a per flow basis not only based on the suffered delay obtained throughput but also based on traffic characteristics like arrival rate and session holding times. The proposed approach provides a means for multi hop QoS support.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The primary object of the invention is to provide methods for admission control and scheduling in an ad hoc wireless network with different classes of flows.<br><br>
One of the methods for admission control in ad hoc networks would be to predict the probability of QoS violation for different classes of traffic and admit only those calls that have a lower probability of QoS violation. Once a session is admitted, we present a scheduling policy for the packets belonging to the sessions. We once again compute the probability of QoS violation for each packet belonging to an admitted session, and use the computed probabilities to obtain the scheduling policy.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention comprises:<br>
•	a method for admission control in wireless ad hoc networks in which the node estimates the probability of delay violation for VoIP and MPEG type traffic in a single hop and admits a call only if the probability of delay violation is below a specified threshold,<br>
•	a method as above where a node estimates the probability of delay violation for VoIP and MPEG type traffic over two hop links and admits a session only if the probability of delay violation is below a specified threshold,<br>
•	a method for admission control in wireless ad hoc networks in which a node estimates the mean one hop and two hop delays for HTTP type traffic and admits only those flows whose estimated mean delay is below a specified limit,<br>
•	a method as above in which nodes estimate the mean throughput for FTP type traffic and admit only those flows whose estimated throughput is above a specified limit,<br>
•	a method for scheduling admitted MPEG and VoIP type flows in wireless ad hoc networks, in which nodes estimate the delay violation statistics for every packet and schedule the packet whose percentage of delay violation is closest to the tolerable threshold<br>
•	a method as above, in which nodes estimate the mean delay statistics of packets belonging to HTTP type flows and throughput violation statistics<br><br>
of packets belonging to FTP type flows, and schedule packets whose percentage deviation from the required threshold is minimum.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention further comprises necessary modifications in the IEEE 802.11 system to incorporate the mechanisms described above.<br>
Accordingly the present invention comprises a method for admission control and scheduling in an ad hoc wireless networks for different classes of flows C1, C2 and C3 where said admission control mechanism evaluates the probability of QoS violation and admits those calls whose probability of QoS violation is below a specified threshold wherein:<br>
(a)	admission Control for Class C1  evaluates the probability as where destination node is a one-hop neighbour of the source node;<br>
(b)	admission Control for Class C1 evaluates the probability as where source and destination nodes are not one hop neighbours;<br>
(c)	admission Control for Class C2 and class C3 flows evaluates the average or mean delay requirement and a requirement on the rate;<br>
(d)	scheduling   class  C1   flows  when  admitted  flows  violate  the  QoS requirements; and<br>
(e)	scheduling class C2 and class C3 flows; provided<br>
(i) C1 represent flows such as voice over IP (VoIP) and streaming video; (ii) C2 represent flows such as hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) and web<br>
browsing; (iii) C3 represent flows such as file transfer protocol (FTP) and downloads.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
A preferred embodiment of the present invention will now be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings. It should be understood however that the disclosed embodiment is merely exemplary of the invention, which may be embodied in various forms. The following description and drawings are not to be construed as limiting the invention and numerous specific details are described to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention, as the basis for the claims and as a basis for teaching one skilled in the art how to make and/or use the invention. However in certain instances, well-known or conventional details are not described in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention in detail.<br>
In many types of wireless networks, IP packets are segmented to MAC packets before they are transmitted over the air interface by the STA's. For the purpose of QoS negotiation, we classify flows as follows:<br>
Class C1: For flows such as voice over IP (VoIP) and streaming video that have very stringent requirements over delay bound and jitter. These flows may also specify their required rate.<br>
Class C2: For flows such as hyper text transfer protocol (HTTP) and web browsing which specify an average delay requirement and a requirement on the rate.<br><br>
class C3: For flows such as file transfer protocol (FTP) and downloads which specify a requirement of rate alone.<br>
Class C4: For flows which have no QoS requirements (called best effort flows).<br>
We make the following assumptions in the system:<br><br>
•<br><br>
Each node knows the two-hop network topology, i.e., each node knows its immediate and two-hop neighbouring nodes. This can be done by observing the RTS messages over a period of time.<br><br>
•	The session arrival process for each class of traffic is as follows [9], i. e., a Poisson process for session arrivals of traffic belonging to any of the four classes specified above.<br>
•	For every newly arriving session at any node, the destination is either a one hop neighbour or a node which is two or more hops away. The probability of a node transmitting data to another node which is three or more hops away is very small (albeit non-zero). This assumption follows from the fact that IEEE 802.11 WLAN presents problems like TCP instability and unfairness in multi-hop wireless networks and hence are not suitable for communication between nodes that are more than two hops away from each other [10].<br>
•	The system supports very limited mobility. This is also a valid assumption since the IEEE 802.11 system is designed for low mobility 0.<br>
The limitation on the performance of a WLAN system in a multi-hop environment enables the proposal of admission control mechanisms for a two hop topology as presented in this invention. Since each node knows its one hop and two hop neighbouring nodes and most of the data communication is expected to be between nodes which are one hop or two hop neighbours, we propose admission control<br><br>
mechanisms that evaluate the probability of QoS violation over two hop links and admit those calls whose probability of QoS violation is below a specified threshold.<br>
LetLf be the length of the ith packet belonging to class Ck. The session arrival<br>
processes for all the classes are Poisson distributed. Let λ(k) be the arrival rate of class Ck packets. Therefore the total arrival rate in a node is given byA = ^A(k).<br>
k<br>
Each node estimates A{k) as follows. At any node, let the number of class Ck flows that arrived up to a window of time/ beA(k)(t). The arrival rate, λ(k), can then be<br>
computed asJi(k) =——. The class of each packet is identified from its header<br>
(this is explained in detail later in page 16) and the arrival rate is computed accordingly. For each class of service, If the channel capacity isC, then the packet<br>
holding time of the/"1 packet belonging to class Ck is given by——.  Let the mean<br>
packet length of a class Ck packet beL(k) and the variance of the packet length of class Ck packet be<r2.></r2.>
In the WLAN DCF delay occurs due to queuing at each node, the transmission delay, i.e., the packet holding time and the basic DCF channel sensing and back off mechanism. The delay on each link depends on the network load and the number of nodes in the network.  Let the packet holding time distribution beF(r). It is noted<br>
thatF(t) can be obtained from the packet length distribution, i.e., the distribution of<br>
the packet length Lf. Let the distribution of the time involved in the DCF operation<br>
on each link (i.e., the DIFS + backoff + freezing of the backoff counter) be B(t). B{t)<br>
can be obtained as the busy period of a GIGIX queue . Thus each node can be modelled as aGIGIX queue with service time distributionG(t) = F(t)*B(t)} where *<br>
represents the Riemann-Stieljes convolution operation [11]. Therefore, the moment<br>
generating function of the service time, G(s), is obtained from the Laplace-Stieljes<br>
transform ofG(/)- G(t) andG(s) can be obtained by solving the Lindley's integral<br><br>
equation [11]. FromG(s)t the moment generating function of the delay in aG/G/l<br>
queue, D(s), and hence, the characteristic function, D(jω), can be obtained. It is<br>
observed that D(s) is the Laplace-Stieljes transform of the one-hop delay distribution.<br>
Mechanism I: Admission Control for Class C1 flows<br>
Class C1 flows have delay bound, jitter and rate requirements to be met, i.e., each class C1 flow in a cell specifies the maximum delay bound that it can suffer, the maximum jitter bound and minimum rate that is required to receive or transmit data. When a MAC packet arrives at a node, the packet carries along with it the packet length, the delay suffered and the destination address. Each class C1 packet also specifies the maximum delay it can tolerate, i.e., the delay bound, dfQ^nd , the jitter<br>
bound, df£r_bound} and the required rate, Rcrekquired. It is noted that in this case,£ = l.<br>
Consider the first packet of a session arriving at a given node. In all further discussions throughout this document, we refer the node under consideration as the "current node". For admission control, the "current node" is the source node. If the destination node is an immediate neighbour to the current node, then the<br>
current node computes the probability Pd^ viol = ?r {Delay &gt;db(^)nd] from D(jco)<br>

are provided, e.g., it is desired to provide a delay bound violation of less than 5 % for MPEG-n traffic, i.e., less than 5 % of the MPEG-n flows suffer a delay greater than the value specified by the delay bound. In general for class k, it is desired that the  fraction  of flows  violating  the  delay  bound  requirement  be  below a<br>
threshold Threshold^ _violated. Hence a call is blocked if P££_viol &gt; Threshold^ violated.<br>
Class C1 flows may also specify a required rate R^kquired. It is essential to block calls<br>
that violate the rate requirement with a probability greater than a specified threshold Threshold^ viofaied. The details of the means to compute the probability of<br><br>
violating the rate requirement, and its application to provide an admission control mechanism, are provided in mechanisms II and III.<br>
Mechanism II: Admission Control for Class C1 flows<br>
In mechanism I, it was assumed that the destination node was a one-hop neighbour of the source node. This mechanism provides the admission control mechanism of the source node and the destination nodes are not one-hop neighbours. If the source and destination nodes are not one hop neighbours then the packets<br>
belonging to class C1 flows have to be traverse at least two hops. FromZ&gt;0), the Laplace-Stieljes transform of the n-hop delay distribution, D{"\s), can be obtained<br>
as \D(s)f .  Therefore,  the  Laplace-Stieljes transform  of the two-hop  delay<br>
distribution, Di2\s) can be obtained as[D(s)f. The probability of a packet violating its    delay    bound    requirements    over    two    hops    is    then    obtained<br>

neighbour of the source node, then the session is blocked if P*i£_«oi&gt; Threshold^_viQhted . Class C1  flows may also specify a required<br>

means to compute the probability of violating the rate requirement, and its application to provide an admission control mechanism, are provided in mechanism<br>
Mechanism III: Admission Control for Class C2 and class C3 flows<br>
Class  C2  flows  specify  requirements  on   mean  delay  and   average   rate. Letd£ekal bound  be the mean delay bound for class Ck flows. Again, it is noted that in<br>
this caseC, = C2. However, the proposed invention is valid for any class of service<br><br>
which has similar requirements. From the expression and values of D(s), obtained as specified in mechanism I, the average time spent in the DCF processing, E[D],<br>
and   the   second   moment,  E[D2]   can   be   obtained   as   E[D] = lim——<br>
and E[D2 ] = lim	^. Thus the variance of the time spent in DCF operations, a2D,<br><br>
can be obtained as<r since each node in the system can be modelled as anm queue mean delay of a packet dmean any class obtained using pollackzek-khinchine value formula to></r>
Dmean=E[D]<br>
, where p = AE[D] is the load at the node and<br>
2(\-py   D}<br>
C2n=-/—^-TT is the square of the co-efficient of variation. When a node has class {E[D]f<br>
C2 traffic to transmit to its single-hop neighbour, the node computes the mean delay based on the load conditions and blocks the call if the mean delay, Dmean, is above<br>
the specified threshold, d^£n_bomd . If the destination node is two or more hops<br>
away from the source node, then the call is blocked if Dmean &gt; d^nbound. Class C2<br>
flows may also specify a minimum required rate. Class C3 flows have requirements of required rate. Let the average length of a packet if class Ck belft. Let the rate<br>
required by class Ck traffic be Rfekquired. It is observed that in this case, Ck=C3. For<br>
class Ck flows, the obtained rate7?(Q) RiCk) =——, where Dmean is the mean delay<br>
mean<br>
which can be obtained as above. To ensureR(Ci) &gt;^quired, Dmem ^—^j- Therefore the    mean    delay    of    C2    flows    for    a    given    load,    Z&gt;        should<br><br>

can also be used for class C3 flows that have a rate requirement.<br><br>

In Mechanisms Mil, we discussed admission control mechanisms for flows based on the QoS requirements. It is possible that the admitted flows violate the QoS requirements. Hence it is essential to devise efficient scheduling mechanisms for the admitted flows. The admitted flows consist of active bursts called packet calls. We propose in mechanisms IV and V, mechanisms for scheduling flows belonging to different classes. To schedule packets belonging to flows of different classes, we<br>
compute pi(c) which is the probability of QoS violation for the ith packet that<br>
belongs to a flow of class Ck. This probability is computed assuming that the packets would be served in the first come first served (FCFS) discipline. The<br>
packets belonging class Ck flows are then partitioned into two subsets S(k) qas-satisfied and S{Q^Violate. The sets(k)qas-satisfied is the set of packets that belong to class Ck flow for which pfk) is below a specified threshold when served according to an FCFS discipline and S^s_Violate is the set of packets that belong to class Ck flow for which pfk) exceeds the required threshold when served according to an FCFS discipline. Among the packets belonging to the setS(QkJs_Violatei consider the subset of packets<br>
S(K) QAS-VIOLATE CS(K) QAS-VIOLATE such that S(K) QAS-VIOLATE IOIC,<p subset contains the packets that may violate delay bound requirement but></p>
can be made to meet the requirements by efficient scheduling policies. The motivation behind forming such a partition is as follows: It is not necessary to compensate packets (belonging to flows) which satisfy their QoS requirements even when an FCFS scheduling policy is adopted. However, packets which may fail to meet the QoS requirements when served according to an FCFS policy are compensated by scheduling. Among the packets that require compensation, we discard those packets which may violate the requirements by a large probability, P and compensate only the other packets.<br>
Mechanism IV: Scheduling class C1 flows<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
The intuition behind choosing r(k) as mentioned in Mechanisms IV and V is as<br>
follows: Flows belonging to different classes have different threshold. Packets may violate these thresholds with different probabilities. The proposed scheduling mechanisms compensate flows which violate the requirements but normalized to as a percentage of the QoS requirement, i.e., different packets may violate the QoS requirements with different probabilities. However if we consider packets belonging to flows of different classes then the probabilities of QoS violations cannot be compared. Therefore, all the probabilities are normalized as a percentage of the required thresholds. Also it can be shown that the variance of r\k) is greater than<br>
that of pifk), thereby providing a better measure of QoS violation of the packet. The<br>
factor of 100 in the expressions for r\k) is to enable the representation of rjk) as a<br>
percentage and also provides large variance in the values of rjk), thus enabling<br>
better prioritisation. r]k) is taken to be zero for best effort flows.<br>
The flow chart for the admission control and scheduling mechanisms proposed above, is shown in Figure 2.<br>
Some practical considerations are considered herein in incorporating the admission control and scheduling mechanisms proposed in this invention, for QoS enhancements in IEEE 802.11 WLAN systems.<br>
It was mentioned earlier in page 8 that the class corresponding to each packet can be identified from the packet header. The mechanism to identify the class of each packet is as described below.<br><br>
ln the IEEE 802.11 WLAN system the MAC frame format appears as shown in Figure 3.<br>
The format for the 2 octets of "Frame Control" appearing in the MAC header shown in Figure 3 is as shown in Figure 4.<br>
The valid combinations for the two bits corresponding to the "Type" and four bits corresponding to the "Subtype" are shown in Figure 5. It is observed that for frame type 10 (corresponding to data frames), sub types 1000 to 1111 are left reserved. The subtypes 1000,1001, 1010, 1011,1100, 1101, 1110 and 1111 are used in the IEEE 802.11e specifications [2] to indicate QoS data, QoS data + CF- Ack, QoS data + CF-Poll, QoS data + CF-Ack + CF-Poll, QoS Null (no data), QoS CF_Ack (no data), QoS CF-Poll (no data), QoS CF-Ack + CF-Poll (no data), respectively. However, in this invention, we consider the basic IEEE 802.11 system and not the QoS enabled system. Therefore, we use the reserved Subtypes 1000, 1001, 1010 and 1011 of the type 10 (corresponding to data frames) to indicate class C1 VoIP, class C1 MPEG, class C2 and class C3 traffic, respectively. Subtype 0000 for type 10 is used to refer only to best effort traffic (class C4). However, to enable differentiation between the basic IEEE 802.11 system deploying the admission control and scheduling mechanism mentioned in this invention and the QoS enabled IEEE 802.11 e system, we use the following distinction. The association request frame in the IEEE 802.11 WLAN systems 0 and IEEE 802.11 e QoS enabled WLAN systems [2] contain an information element on the capabilities of each station that associates with an independent basic service set (IBSS). This can be used to differentiate between stations enabled with IEEE 802.11 e QoS mechanisms and basic IEEE 802.11 stations enabled with the admission control mechanisms described in this invention.<br>
It is also noted that the stations do not compute the probabilities mentioned in Mechanisms l-V on an online basis, i. e., the stations are not required to compute the probabilities using the formulae given in mechanism l-V as and when each packet arrives. Instead, these computations are made offline for different discrete<br><br>
•rvalues of arrival rates of each class and the number of hops, and stored in a 4 dimensional matrix. This 4 dimensional matrix is then used as a look up table to obtain the QoS violation statistics for each type of flow or for each packet corresponding to a flow.<br>
It is also observed that the admission control and scheduling mechanisms are applied only when the system reaches steady state.<br>

It will also be obvious to those skilled in the art that other control methods and apparatuses can be derived from the combinations of the various methods and apparatuses of the present invention as taught by the description and the accompanying drawings and these shall also be considered within the scope of the present invention. Further, description of such combinations and variations is therefore omitted above. It should also be noted that the host for storing the applications include but not limited to a computer, mobile communication device, mobile server or a multi function device.<br>
Although the present invention has been fully described in connection with the preferred embodiments thereof with reference to the accompanying drawings, it is to be noted that various changes and modifications are possible and are apparent to those skilled in the art. Such changes and modifications are to be understood as included within the scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims unless they depart there from.<br><br>

WE CLAIM<br>
1. A method for admission control and scheduling in an ad hoc wireless network for different classes of flows C1, C2 and C3 where said admission control mechanism evaluates the probability of QoS violation and admits those calls whose probability of QoS violation is below a specified threshold wherein:<br>
(a)	admission Control for Class C1  evaluates the probability as where<br>
destination node is a one-hop neighbour of the source node;<br>
(b)	admission Control for Class C1 evaluates the probability as where source and destination nodes are not one hop neighbours;<br>
(c)	admission Control for Class C2 and class C3 flows evaluates the average or mean delay requirement and a requirement on the rate;<br><br>
(d)	scheduling   class  C1   flows  when  admitted  flows  violate  the  QoS requirements; and<br>
(e)	scheduling class C2 and class C3 flows; provided<br>
(i)   C1 represent flows such as voice over IP (VoIP) and streaming<br>
video; (ii) C2 represent flows such as hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) and<br>
web browsing; (ii) C3 represent flows such as file transfer protocol (FTP) and<br>
downloads.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
19. A method as claimed in claim 1 wherein for every newly arriving session at any node, the destination is either a one hop neighbour or a node which is two or more hops away.<br>
20.	A method as claimed in claim 1 wherein the probability of a node transmitting<br>
data to another node, which is three or more, hops away is very small.<br>
21.	A method as claimed in claim 1 wherein the system supports very limited<br>
mobility.<br>
22.	A method as claimed in claim 1 wherein the said method is used to predict the<br>
probability of QoS violation for different classes of traffic and admit only those<br>
calls that have a lower probability of QoS violation.<br>
23.A method as claimed in claim 1 wherein once a session is admitted, a scheduling policy for the packets belonging to the sessions is formulated.<br>
24.	A method as claimed in claim 1 wherein once again the probability of QoS<br>
violation for each packet belonging to an admitted session is computed, and use<br>
the computed probabilities to obtain the scheduling policy.<br>
25.	A method for admission control and scheduling in ad hoc wireless networks for<br>
different class of flows such as substantially herein described particularly with<br>
