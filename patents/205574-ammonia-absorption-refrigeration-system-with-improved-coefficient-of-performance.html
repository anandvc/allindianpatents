Ammonia Absorption Refrigeration System with Improved Coefficient Of Performance<br><br><br>

The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br>
Field of Invention:<br>
This invention relates to the ammonia absorption refrigeration (AAR) system and more particularly to the system where refrigeration is required at one or multiple temperature levels. This invention relates particularly to the generation of ultra pure refrigeration grade ammonia (upto 5ppm moisture) for use in very low temperature applications (in the range of -60°C).- With this invention, the Coefficient of Performance (COP) of the •^ammonia absorption system is improved.<br>
Background of Invention:<br>
Many processes in various industries like pharmaceuticals / fertilizers / food processing etc. require cooling at sub-zero temperatures, which use heat as primary energy source. Refrigeration implies maintenance of a temperature below that of the surroundings. This requires continuous absorption of heat at a low temperature level, usually accomplished by evaporation of liquid. The vapour generated may be returned to its original liquid state for re-evaporation in two ways: i) it is simply compressed and then condensed (Vapour-Compression Refrigeration) or ii) it is absorbed by a liquid of low volatility and then distilled at higher pressure (Absorption Refrigeration).<br>
In vapour-compression refrigeration the work of compression is usually supplied by an electric motor. The source of electric energy is a heat engine used to drive a generator. Thus, the work of refrigeration comes ultimately from heat at higher temperature level. This suggests that direct use of heat as the energy source of refrigeration. The absorption refrigeration uses direct heat energy as the energy source for refrigeration. Ammonia absorption technology is normally characterized by low COP's and is viable when sufficient heat is available for driving the absorption cycle. Thus, the viability entirely depends on cost of the primary energy in the form of low/ medium pressure steam or hot water.<br>
COP is heat units withdrawn from external coolant load cycle  [that is units of refrigeration achieved] divided by heat units input to achieve that refrigeration OR percent COP is COP x 100.<br><br>
In the absorption refrigeration (AR) system two complete cycles are in operation: a refrigerant cycle and an absorption cycle. Refrigerant coolant cycle external to this system is supported by this system or AR system is developed for supporting external coolant cycle requirements.<br>
Ammonia absorption refrigeration (AAR) is a specific example of absorption refrigeration where the vaporizing refrigerant is ammonia and the solvent is either water or dilute aqueous ammonia. The greatest asset of the system is that it can be driven by any available process heat source, where temperature is high enough for the distillation step. A conventional, ammonia absorption refrigeration system is shown in Figure.l in the accompanying drawing. It has following main components:<br>
1.	A Distillation column with<br>
2.	A Re-boiler at the bottom and<br>
3.	A Condenser at the top<br>
4.	A refrigerant Tank<br>
5.	An Expansion Valve<br>
6.	An Evaporator<br>
7.	An Absorber<br>
8.	A Solution Pump<br>
9.	Solution Heat Exchanger<br>
The refrigerant vapour generated from evaporator (6) is absorbed in absorber (7) by a low volatile solvent - water at evaporator pressure. The refrigerant rich liquid solution from absorber (7) passes to a solution pump (8), which raises the pressure of the liquid to the condenser (3) pressure. Heat from the higher temperature source is transferred in re-boiler<br>
(2)	to the compressed liquid solution in a distillation column (1) raising its temperature and evaporating the refrigerant from the solvent. The vapour is condensed in a condenser<br>
(3)	and the solvent left in the distillation column (1) is returned as weak aqua to the absorber (7) after transferring the heat to the pressurised refrigerant rich strong solution from solution pump (8) in solution heat exchanger (9) for absorbing the refrigerant vapour generated from the evaporator (6). The condensed refrigerant is collected in refrigerant tank (4) and is expanded through an expansion valve (5) to the evaporator pressure and sent to the evaporator (6) for re-evaporation. The ammonia vapour generated in the re-boiler contains considerable amount of water vapour. This ammonia-water<br><br>
vapour mixture is rectified in the distillation column (1) to the required level of purity and then condensed in the condenser (3) to generate refrigerant liquid. The purification is accomplished by sending some of the condensed liquid as reflux to the distillation column (!)•<br>
Prior Art:<br>
Following patents describe prior art close to the present invention:<br>
1. US 3817050 " Two-stage ammonia absorption refrigeration system with at least three evaporation stages", 1974, Alexander D; Muenger J, TEXACO INC The US patent 3817050 describes an AAR system with at least three evaporators for producing refrigeration at different temperature levels with the absorbers maintained at two pressure levels. The system is based on generation of ammonia vapours from the aqueous solution in a tower, as in a conventional system, and improving the purity of ammonia in a second tower. The ammonia at different purity levels is used as refrigerant to produce the specified refrigeration levels. The very high purity ammonia being produced from the second tower contains 0.01 % water. The cooling water used is mentioned as available at 60 ° F (equivalent to 15.6 ° C). The minimum refrigeration temperature claimed in the prior art is minus 57 ° F (equivalent to minus 49.5 ° C). The ammonia streams generated from the second tower are used in the evaporators for producing refrigeration. The ammonia vapours generated in the evaporators are absorbed in weak aqua and are pumped back to the first tower.<br>
In the US patent 3817050<br>
a.    Refrigerant ammonia is at purity levels of (i) not less than 0.01  %<br>
(equivalent to 100 ppm) moisture and (ii) more than 0.2 % (equivalent to<br>
2000 ppm) moisture.<br>
This higher moisture level in the refrigerant ammonia will reduce the performance of<br>
the AAR system, as it will require high amount of bleed or purge stream to control the<br>
moisture levels in the evaporator.<br>
b. A very low temperature cooling water namely, at 60    F (equivalent to 15.6 °C) is required. This is not a generally prevailing cooling water temperature.<br><br>
c. The lowest temperature generated is minus 57 ° F   (equivalent to minus 49.5 ° C) only. It cannot cool to temperature less than minus 49.5 ° C.<br>
2. US 5231849 " Dual -Temperature vehicular absorption refrigeration system", 1993, Joel H. Rosenblatt.<br>
The US patent 5231849 describes an automotive ammonia absorption refrigeration system for providing comfort zone cooling and a lower temperature cargo zone cooling utilizing the waste heat from the automotive engine exhaust gases. The system described comprises components of a conventional AAR system. The ammonia is generated using the hot exhaust gas from the engine of a vehicle and air cooled condenser is used for condensing the ammonia vapour. The objective of this prior art is to facilitate development of a vehicle engine system with its associated AAR sub-system as an integrated design.<br>
The US patent 5231849<br>
a.	is AAR system for a specific application, i.e., for vehicular refrigeration using heat of<br>
the exhaust gas of the vehicle engine.<br>
b.	is not a versatile AAR system<br>

requirement.<br>
d.	achieves this low temperature with high grade energy input<br>
e.	has more than one absorber vessel, more than one refrigerant solution pump.<br>
f.	has more than one evaporator  vessel, more than one evaporator pressure-reducing<br>
valve<br>

The principal object of the present invention is to provide an improved AAR system with high / improved COP by providing means for controlling residual moisture levels in refrigerant ammonia and means to generate refrigerant ammonia liquid streams with different moisture levels.<br><br>
Another object of the invention is to develop AAR system with higher COP, working with lower temperature heat source and higher temperature cooling system compared to prior art processes.<br>
Main object of the present invention is to overcome the limitations of the prior art and to develop an improved AAR system with high coefficient of performance (COP).<br>
One part of the principle object of the present invention is to design a rectification column and condenser system for providing different purity level refrigerant ammonia with at least one stream containing upto 5 ppm moisture, so as to provide refrigeration up to minus 60°C.<br>
Another part of the principle object of this invention is to explore and develop open loop system by injection of steam as a source for heat.<br>
An additional objective is to provide multiple temperature level refrigeration by withdrawing refrigerant ammonia, at one or multiple levels, from the rectification column together with generation of pure water from the bottom of the stripping section with very low ammonia content, typically less than 2 ppm, after efficient heat recovery with improved coefficient of performance (COP) therby operating the system in open loop with respect to absorbant water.<br>

Detailed Description of the invention:<br>
First we shall see description of the preferred embodiment of the present invention and later see in what way the present invention differs from the prior art systems described above.<br>
The Ammonia Absorption refrigeration system of present invention is typically described<br>
in the enclosed Figure-2 in the accompanying drawing. The basic components shown in<br>
the Fig 2 are: (10): heat source<br>
(11): re-boiler,<br>
(12): stripping column,<br>
(13, 14): two partial condensers,<br>
(15): rectification column,<br>
(16): total condenser,<br>
(17, 18): evaporators,<br>
(19,20): absorbers,<br>
(21,22): solution pumps,<br>
(23): solution heat exchanger,<br>
(24, 26):    sub-coolers, and<br>
(25, 27): expansion valves<br>
The refrigerant vapour generated in evaporator (17) is absorbed in weak aqueous solution of ammonia (solution 1) keeping pressure in absorber (19) same as that in evaporator (17). The refrigerant rich liquid solution (solution 2) from absorber (19) passes to a solution pump (21), which raises the pressure of the liquid to that of the second evaporator (18). The refrigerant vapour generated in evaporator (18) is absorbed in the rich aqueous solution (solution 2) of ammonia from absorber (19) at pressure of evaporator (18) in absorber (20). The strong ammonia solution (solution 3) from absorber (20) passes to a solution pump (22) which raises the pressure of the liquid to that of the total condenser (16) pressure. A part of the strong aqueous ammonia solution (solution 3)<br><br>
from solution pump (22) is heated in solution heat exchanger (23) using the heat of weak aqueous solution (solution 1) from the bottom of the stripping column (12) and then fed to the top of stripping column (12) and the other part is introduced directly to the top of stripping column (12). Re-boil is provided at the bottom of the stripping column (12) by heat source, like steam by indirect heating in a re-boiler (11) or by direct steam injection (in case of an open loop configuration). The ammonia-water vapour from the top of stripping column (12) enters the partial condensers (13, 14) in series. The partially condensed liquid predominantly rich in water (solution 4,5) from the partial condensers (13,14) is recycled to the stripping column (12). Ammonia vapour containing little moisture is fed to the rectification column (15), wherein it is rectified by using the reflux from the top. The ultra pure ammonia vapour (
The system aescribed in the present invention can reduce the ammonia content in the weak aqueous solution (solution 1) to very low, typically below 2 ppm and thus is capable of keeping the entire AAR system with water in open loop. Thus the present invention can also be used for providing refrigeration effect with water circuit in open loop. The heat input to the stripping column in case of steam can further be direct injection of steam with out any re-boiler (11).<br>
The use of partial condenser(s) as indicated in the above description improves the performance of the process by making more amount of refrigerant ammonia available for the refrigeration process. The use of one or several partial condensers will enrich the ammonia vapours by removing the moisture in a gradual manner and thereby providing a purer ammonia vapour with respect to moisture to the rectification column. The partial condensers cool the vapours coming out of the vapour generation section to temperature range between 45°C to 85°C and enable pre-purification with respect to water content before sent to the rectification column. The ammonia-water vapour from the top of<br><br>
stripping column, if fed directly to the rectification column, the amount of reflux liquid required to get high purity ammonia from the top of rectification column will be substantially high and thereby reducing the amount of refrigerant ammonia for refrigeration. The use of partial condensers in the process enables use of reduced quantity of reflux for the rectification column to enrich this pure vapour and also make it possible to use the refluxed liquid drawn from the bottom of the rectification column to be used as refrigerant.<br>
The two evaporators (17), (18) are at the decreasing temperatures of-10 to -15 °C and -25 to -32°C respectively. The strong ammonia solution (solution 3) concentration is in the range of 20 to 24% ammonia. The weak aqueous solution concentration is in the range of 
In one embodiment of the present invention, the heat source is steam circulated in the closed coil in the stripping column and the absorbent water is in closed loop mode.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, it is a direct open steam injection into stripping column and the absorbent water either in open loop or in partially open loop mode. In the open loop mode,the absorbent water is directly fed to either one or both the absorbers and the heat source steam is directly fed to the bottom of the stripping column and both are removed from the bottom of the rectification column. In the partial open loop mode of the system absorbent water is added to one or both the absorbers and is removed from bottom of the stripper and the heat source steam is not direct steam but through the re-boiler.<br><br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the heat source is sometimes partly steam circulated in the closed coil and partly direct open steam injection into stripping column and the absorbent water either in open loop or in partially open loop mode.<br>
In closed loop mode when steam is circulated in the closed coil as a heat source, some times the heat source can be a direct firing arrangement, waste heat process streams, waste exhaust gases etc., instead of steam, circulated appropriately in a closed coil.<br>
When heat source is steam it can be high pressure / low pressure steam or even hot water. The means for generating ammonia vapours at atleast two desired pressure levels from the refrigerant ammonia by generating cooling effect in which one temperature being upto -60 °C comprises, atleast two evaporators (17,18), atleast one sub-cooler (24) and atleast two expansion valves (25,27) and connected such that the refrigerant vapour is generated in the said evaporators.<br>
The means for absorbing the said ammonia vapours with aqueous ammonia solution(s) comprise atleast one absorber (19) and it is connected with pumps.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the means for generation of ammonia vapours at higher pressure level containing moisture from the aqueous ammonia solution is by supplying external heat; passing the strong ammonia solution (solution 3) from said absorber (19) to said solution pump (22); raising the pressure of the liquid to that of the said total condenser (16) pressure; heating a part or full of the strong aqueous ammonia solution (solution 3) from said solution pump (22) in said solution heat exchanger (23) using the heat of weak aqueous solution (solution 1) from the bottom of said stripping column (12) and then feeding to the top of stripping column (12); providing re-boiling at the bottom of the said stripping column (12) by heat source like steam in said re-boiler (11).<br>
The means for controlled enrichment of ammonia with step wise reduction of the moisture content of the vapour is by passing the ammonia-water vapouf'from the top of said stripping column (12) into atleast one or more said partial condensers (13,14) in series and recycling the partially condensed liquid predominantly rich in water from the said partial condensers into the said stripping column (12).<br><br>
The means for rectification of the enriched ammonia vapours and condensing the vapours for generation of liquid ammonia refrigerant at controlled moisture concentration, generating ultra pure ammonia containing moisture upto 5 ppm comprise feeding ammonia vapour containing little moisture to the said rectification column (15), wherein it is rectified by using the reflux from the top; condensing the ultra pure ammonia vapour (upto 5 ppm moisture) from the said column top in the said total condenser ; refluxing a part of the said condensed liquid into the column (15) and sending the rest to evaporator (17); sending the said reflux provided for the top of said rectification column(15) with drawn from the column bottom as second source of refrigerant to said evaporator (18) via said sub-cooler (24) and said expansion valve (25).<br>
The System has heat source as direct steam injection to stripping column (12) and the absorbent water either in open loop or in partially open loop mode.<br>
The stripping column may be replaced with any other mode of vapour generator and partial condenser(s) provided in series or parallel between the said vapour generator and rectification column.<br>
Distinguishing features of the invention:<br>
The present invention has low energy input, low temperature heat input; higher cooling water temperature and yet lower temperature achieved in refrigerator- coolant cycle, by the AAR system; thus giving higher COP compared to the prior art processes.<br>
a.	The intention of the present invention is to generate substantially purer refrigerant<br>
ammonia and thereby increasing the performance of the system.<br>
b.	The present invention is based on cooling water temperature of not less than 30 ° C,.<br>

ammonia concentration from the bottom of the rectification column is in the range 99.8%<br>
to 99.9% ammonia, while the refrigerant ammonia from the top of rectification column is<br>
very pure with moisture content of less than 5ppm in ammonia.<br>
The pressure level of the operation of the system was aboutl6 kg/cm  for the ammonia<br>
regeneration section.<br>
