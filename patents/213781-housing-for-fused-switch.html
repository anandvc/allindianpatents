				<td>Housing for fused switch<br>
The present invention relates to a housing according to<br>
the preamble of claim 1 for a fused switch.<br>
Fused switches having a fused switch housing of the type<br>
concerned herein are used, e.g., in electricity distribu-<br>
tion, supply of electric equipment and in different types<br>
of electric circuits. The function of a fused switch is<br>
to pass electric current from a feeder circuit to a con-<br>
sumer circuit via at least one fuse located in the fused<br>
switch. Another function of the fused switch is to serve<br>
as a circuit breaker between the feeder and consumer cir-<br>
cuits permitting the electric connection between said<br>
circuits to be interrupted when so required. A single<br>
fused switch can be made to connect a plurality of elec-<br>
tric circuits to each other. For instance, a three-phase<br>
fused switch may comprise at least three first and second<br>
contact members with conductor parts connecting said<br>
members via fuses.<br>
Conventionally, a fused switch includes at least one pair<br>
of moving contacts and a fuse connected in series. In<br>
modern fused switches the fuses are mounted in removable<br>
fuse adapters in order to ease the task of fuse replace-<br>
ment. This kind of switch design with a fuse adapter<br>
facilitates the use of single fused switch housing in<br>
conjunction with a number of different fuse types.<br>
Thence, only the fuse adapter need to be selected compat-<br>
ible with the fuse type in use. In a well-designed<br>
adapter-type fused switch, fuse replacement is also<br>
extremely safe to the person performing the operation.<br>
The fuse adapter comprises contact parts on which the<br>
fuse is easy to mount. The contact parts of the fuse<br>
adapter also act as the electrical contact between the<br>
fuse and the elements of the fused switch housing when<br>
the adapter with the fuse is inserted in place. The<br>
housing of the fused switch carries the stationary con-<br>
tacts with their springed contact parts serving to form<br>
an electrical contact with the mating contact parts of<br>
the fuse adapter. In the switched circuit, the stationary<br>
contacts of the switch housing located to both sides of<br>
the fuse are arranged to cooperate either on both sides<br>
with their respective moving contacts, or alternatively,<br>
so arranged that on one side the stationary contacts<br>
cooperate with the moving contacts and on the other side<br>
are directly connected to the terminals of the external<br>
circuit.<br>
The path of current flowing through a conventional fused<br>
switch passes from the input terminals of the fused<br>
switch over the moving contact members and their contact<br>
surfaces to the stationary contacts of the switch<br>
housing, and therefrom, further over other connections to<br>
the first contact parts of the fuse adapter. Subsequent<br>
to the fuse adapter contact parts, current passes over<br>
the interface between these contact parts and those of<br>
the fuse proper, and then over the second, similar fuse<br>
contact interface to the second contact parts of the fuse<br>
adapter. Prior to reaching the output terminals of the<br>
fused switch, the current must pass at least the contact<br>
interface between the second contact parts of the fuse<br>
adapter and the second stationary contact parts of the<br>
fused switch. Resultingly, each current path of<br>
conventional fused switches contains at least four<br>
connections/contacts on the fuse and switch side of the<br>
fuse adapter plus the internal connections of the switch<br>
itself.<br>
The number and quality of connections in a fused switch<br>
affect the properties of the fused switch. This is<br>
because each connection involves a separate interface<br>
resistance that in turn causes additional heating of the<br>
fused switch and thus reduces its load rating. Further-<br>
more, the fabrication of any single connection is a<br>
separate cost factor and each connection is a potential<br>
origin of malfunction. Another aspect affecting the<br>
current breaking capacity of a switch is. essentially<br>
related to the number and operating speed of current-<br>
breaking connections provided on the current path. The<br>
greater the number of simultaneously operating air gaps<br>
in series the faster the switch can quench a possible arc<br>
striking between the contact surfaces of opening switch<br>
members. Arcing causes undesirable wear in the switch and<br>
generates interference in the form of electromagnetic<br>
radiation, for instance. The quenching properties of the<br>
contact gap arc are particularly important in DC<br>
switches. AC switches are not so critical in this sense<br>
inasmuch the current passing in an AC circuit over an arc<br>
inherently crosses zero twice during each cycle.<br>
Hence, the type and number of contacts acting as opening<br>
gaps in a fused switch must be designed chiefly on the<br>
basis of their current-breaking properties. In turn, the<br>
number of connections not participating in current turn-<br>
off should be minimized.<br>
Prior-art technology of fuse-adapter-type fused switches<br>
is handicapped by having at least four connections per<br>
each current path such that do not participate in the<br>
actual switching operation.<br>
It is an object of the invention to provide an entirely<br>
new type of housing for a fused sVitch, wherein redundant<br>
connections are eliminated.<br>
The goal of the invention is achieved by a switch design<br>
having at least some of the fuse adapter contact surfaces<br>
which face those of the switch housing and make the elec-<br>
trical connections between the fuse and the switch hous-<br>
ing to additionally perform as opening/closing contacts<br>
of the switch. Accordingly, the invention is based on<br>
combining at least one of two connections which make the<br>
electrical connections between the fuse and the switch<br>
housing with its series-connected opening"/closing contact<br>
so as to form a single contact-type connection.<br>
More specifically, the fused switch housing according to<br>
the invention is characterized by what is stated in the<br>
characterizing part of claim 1.<br>
The invention offers significant benefits.<br>
With the exception of fuse connections, the fused switch<br>
according to the invention need not necessarily have any<br>
such internal connections that do not participate with<br>
the circuit switching functions. The connections between<br>
the fuses and contact parts of the fuse adapter are<br>
required for implementing the adapter-type fused switch<br>
design. Hence, with the aid of the invention, unnecessary<br>
connections in the present fused switch construction are<br>
disposed of.<br>
The invention makes it possible to reduce the heating of<br>
the fused switch under electrical load thus improving the<br>
load rating of the switch. The simple construction of the<br>
fused switch is also more reliable in service and more<br>
cost-effective to produce.<br>
In the following, the invention will be examined with the<br>
help of exemplifying embodiments by making reference to<br>
the attached drawings, in which:<br>
Figure 1 shows a fused switch design according to the<br>
invention in a view taken obliquely from above;<br>
Figure 2 shows a fuse adapter suitable for use in the<br>
fused switch illustrated in Fig. 1;<br>
Figure 3 shows one current path in a fused switch<br>
according to the invention; and<br>
Figure 4 shows the current path of Fig. 3 in a view taken<br>
obliquely from above.<br>
In Fig. l is shown a fused switch suitable for control-<br>
ling a three-phase circuit. The fused switch comprises a<br>
fused switch housing 1, and connected to the fused switch<br>
housing 1, three parallel-mounted fuse adapters 2 which<br>
form a portion of the front surface of the fused switch.<br>
Additionally, the fused switch front surface comprises a<br>
control slot 3 amidst two fuse adapters 2 for mounting a<br>
control device (not shown) on the fused switch. The<br>
control device makes it possible to open or close the<br>
switch contacts. In practice, the control device can be,<br>
e.g., a handle.<br>
The upper surface of the fused switch housing 1 has a set<br>
of three terminals 4 for connecting the fused switch to a<br>
first external circuit which may be either a feeder<br>
circuit or a consumer circuit. The bottom side of the<br>
fused switch housing 1 has a second set of corresponding<br>
terminals for connecting the fused switch to a second<br>
external circuit. In the fused switch embodiment shown in<br>
the diagram, the first and second sets of terminals 4 are<br>
connected to the fuse adapter 2 via the contact parts so<br>
that two opening contact gaps are provided on both sides<br>
between the terminal sets and the fuse adapter 2. In this<br>
type of device, there is no difference whether the ter-<br>
minals 4 of the upper or lower surface are connected to<br>
the consumer circuit. If the opening contact gaps are<br>
provided only between the second set of terminals 4 and<br>
the fuse adapter 2, reasons of safety dictate that the<br>
feeder circuit should preferably be connected to those<br>
terminals 4 that are connected to the conductors of the<br>
fuse adapters 2 via the opening/closing contacts.<br>
Fig. 2 shows the fuse adapter 2 of the fused switch in a<br>
view taken obliquely from behind the switch. The diagram<br>
illustrates the fuse holder clips 5 made from a conduct-<br>
ing material such as copper. The first end of each fuse<br>
holder clip 5 is so bent that it forms a clinching leaf<br>
spring slot suited to accommodate the ferrule 17 of the<br>
fuse 14 (Figs. 3 and 4) . The fuse holder clips 5 are com-<br>
plemented with springs 6 serving to press the contact<br>
surfaces of the fuse holder clip 5 against the ferrule 17<br>
of the fuse 14 (Figs. 3 and 4) thus assuring a good elec-<br>
trical contact. The fuse holder clips 5 are mounted on<br>
the fuse adapter 2 which is made from a dielectric mate-<br>
rial such as a plastic. The first ends of the fuse holder<br>
clips 5 are supported on the fuse adapter 2 by appropri-<br>
ately shaped support brackets 7.<br>
The second ends of the fuse holder clips 5 are supported<br>
by contact support projections 8 made on the fuse adap-<br>
ter 2. The contact support projections 8 and the fused<br>
switch housing 1 have such a compatible design that when<br>
the fuse adapter 2 is mounted in place, the contact sup-<br>
port projections 8 will be inserted through openings made<br>
to the fused switch housing 1 so as to protrude into the<br>
interior of the fused switch housing 1. Thence, the se*"<br>
cond ends of the fuse holder clips 5 form on the surface<br>
of the contact support projections 8 such contact sur-<br>
faces 9 that after their insertion into the interior of<br>
the fused switch housing 1 can act as the first set of<br>
contact surfaces 10. On the contact support projections 8<br>
are also made stops 18 with cavities 19 remaining behind<br>
the same. In the diagram are also illustrated spring-leaf<br>
type auxiliary contacts 11 of a conducting material that<br>
are electrically connected to the fuse holder clips 5.<br>
The function of the auxiliary contacts 11 is to make an<br>
electrical connection from both ferrules of the fuse and<br>
to the fuse condition monitoring terminals of the fused<br>
switch. Thus, the auxiliary contacts facilitate a fuse<br>
continuity test without any need for removing the fuse<br>
from the fused switch.<br>
Fig. 3 shows those parts of the fused switch that par-<br>
ticipate in the formation of a current path through the<br>
fused switch. The same parts are shown in Fig. 4 in a<br>
view taken slightly obliquely from above. The current<br>
path is formed by two stationary contacts 12, two moving<br>
contacts 13, two fuse holder clips 5 and the fuse 14. The<br>
stationary contact 12 is a member made of a conducting<br>
material whose first end extends up to the terminal 4<br>
(Fig. 1) so as to form the lug 15 of the terminal 14. The<br>
second end of the stationary contact 12 extends at a<br>
distance from the contact support projection 8 (Fig. 2)<br>
of the mounted fuse adapter 2 thus forming a second set<br>
of contact surfaces 16 aligned essentially parallel to<br>
the first set of contact surfaces 10. The shape of the<br>
moving contact 13 is made compatible with the contact<br>
surfaces 10, 16 such that it facilitates the formation of<br>
an electrical connection between said contact surfaces<br>
10, 16.<br>
The moving contacts 13 can be actuated by means of con-<br>
ventional switching members capable of actuating the<br>
moving contacts 13 in a spring-loaded manner from one<br>
position to another. Such switching members may comprise,<br>
e.g, springs connected to the moving contacts 13, trigger<br>
elements limiting the movement of the moving contacts 13<br>
and a handle serving to control the movement of the<br>
switching members and to transmit the switch actuating<br>
energy to the switching members. To open the switch, the<br>
handle must be rotated, whereby energy is stored in the<br>
actuating springs. After the handle is rotated suffi-<br>
ciently far, the trigger elements release the moving con-<br>
tacts 13 into a fast movement apart from the stationary<br>
contact surfaces 10, 16. This arrangement serves to<br>
shorten the duration of arcing between the contacts. In<br>
the closing operation of the switch, the trigger elements<br>
function in a similar manner, but now in a reverse<br>
direction.<br>
The switching members may also include interlock cams<br>
(not shown) that cooperate with the moving contacts 13 or<br>
alternatively, with other parts moving along with the<br>
same, such as the support/control elements of the moving<br>
contacts 13. The function of these interlock cams is to<br>
prevent the mount ing/dismount ing of the fuse adapter 2 in<br>
place in the fused switch when the switch is in its<br>
closed position. This arrangement serves to prevent the<br>
. closure/disconnection of a circuit by means of manual<br>
insert ion/withdrawal of the fuse adapter 2. Due to the<br>
slow speed of manual circuit connection/disconnection,<br>
the result might be a long-lasting arc in both or only<br>
one contact gap between the fuse holder clip 5 and its<br>
respective moving contact 13. Such an arc could be<br>
hazardous for both the switch and the person operating<br>
the same.<br>
Accordingly, the interlock cam is arranged to follow the<br>
movement of the moving contact 13. In the exemplifying<br>
embodiment, the interlock cam is so disposed and shaped<br>
that in the closed position of the fused switch, the cam<br>
extends past that contact surface of the moving contact<br>
13 which is adapted to cooperate with the first contact<br>
surface 10, whereby the cam passes over that edge of the<br>
moving contact which faces the fuse adapter 2. Thus, when<br>
the fuse adapter 2 is properly inserted to the fused<br>
switch housing, the cam can enter a recess 19 which, when<br>
viewed from the fused switch housing 1 towards the fuse<br>
adapter 2, is left behind a stop 18 in the contact<br>
support projection 8. Now, if an attempt is made to<br>
remove the fuse adapter 2, the stop 18 meets the cam thus<br>
preventing the removal of the fuse adapter 2. Respective-<br>
ly, in a situation in which the switch is closed and the<br>
fuse adapter 2 is removed, the cam meets the stop 18 thus<br>
preventing the mounting of the fuse adapter 2 into the"<br>
fused switch when the latter is in its closed position.<br>
When the switch is turned into its open position, the cam<br>
is withdrawn along with the moving contacts 13 from the<br>
vicinity of the contact surfaces 10, 16, thus permitting<br>
the mounting and dismounting of the fuse adapter- 2 with-<br>
out the. interlock function of the cam and the 6t?©p 18.<br>
Advantageously, the cam and the stop 18 are made from a<br>
dielectric material.<br>
Accordingly, the fused switch embodiment shown in Figs. 3<br>
and 4 has a total number of six internal connections.<br>
Obviously necessary are also the feeder and consumer<br>
circuit connections at the contact surfaces 15 of the<br>
terminals 4. Hence, four of the six internal connections<br>
can simultaneously act as opening/closing contact gaps.<br>
These opening/closing contacts are formed by the connec-<br>
tions between the first contact surfaces 10 and the<br>
moving contacts 13, and respectively, between the second<br>
contact surfaces 16 and the moving contacts 13. The non-<br>
opening connections are required only between the fuse<br>
holder clips 5 and the ferrules 17 of the fuses 14. These<br>
two connections not participating in the switching func-<br>
tions are necessary to assure an easy and safe fuse<br>
change and to guarantee reliable function of the<br>
opening/closing contact gaps.<br>
Without departing from the scope and spirit of the inven-<br>
tion, also embodiments different from those described<br>
above may be contemplated. For instance, the number of<br>
series-connected contacts with their mating contact<br>
surfaces on each current path can be increased from that<br>
mentioned in the described embodiments. Alternatively,<br>
the number of opening/closing contact gaps can be<br>
reduced, which means that the switch can be implemented<br>
using one, two or three opening/closing contact gaps.<br>
Herein, a hinged-type switch construction could be<br>
contemplated with a single opening/closing contact gap<br>
adapted to operate on at least one side of the fuse.<br>
Then, the other end of the contact member could be taken<br>
directly to the input/output terminal of the external<br>
circuit. This type of a switch with a single opening/<br>
closing contact gap could be readily implemented using a<br>
flexible conducting member. The moving contacts can also<br>
be of the knife-blade type.<br>

wherein said contact support projections<br>
(8) are provided for each moving contact (13) with at<br>
least one stop (18) adapted to cooperate with said cam<br>
moving along with said moving contact (13) so as to<br>
prevent the mounting of said fuse adapter (2) into said<br>
fused switch housing (1) or alternatively, dismounting<br>
the same from said fused switch housing (1) when said<br>
moving contact (13) is switched into its closed<br>
position.<br>
The present invention relates to a fused<br>
switch housing (1) suited to accommodate at<br>
least one fuse adapter (2) having a first and<br>
a second contact surface (10). The fused<br>
switch housing (1) comprises a first and a<br>
second set of terminals (15) for respectively<br>
connecting the fused switch to a first and<br>
a second external circuit, stationary contacts<br>
(12, 15, 16), and at least one moving contact<br>
(13). The fused switch housing also includes<br>
switching means cooperating with each of<br>
said moving contacts (13) for making an<br>
electrical connection between each of said first<br>
terminals (15) respectively with each of said<br>
first contact surfaces (10) as well as for making<br>
an electrical connection between each of said<br>
second terminals (15) respectively with each<br>
of said second contact surfaces (10) so that at<br>
least one of said connections with said contact<br>
surfaces is openable by moving said at least<br>
one moving contact (13) with the help of said<br>
switching means. Herein, at least one moving<br>
contact (13) is adapted to press directly against<br>
said first or, second stationary contact surfaces<br>
so as to form an electrical contact.</td>
