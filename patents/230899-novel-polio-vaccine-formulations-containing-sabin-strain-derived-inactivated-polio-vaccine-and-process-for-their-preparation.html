				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to of novel Polio Vaccine Formulation containing Sabin strain derived inactivated polio vaccine and process for their preparation.<br>
More particularly the present invention relates to Polio Vaccine. Formulations containing Sabin strain derived inactivated polio vaccine and number of other antigens effective against one or more of the pathogens like Hepatitis C, Hepatitis D, Hepatitis E, Meningitis A, Meningitis B, Meningitis C, Meningitis W, Meningitis Y, Smallpox, Typhoid, Bacille Calmette Guerin, Tuberculosis, Human Immunodeficiency Virus, Anthrax or the like.<br>
The Polio Vaccine Formulations prepared according to the present invention are very beneficial for children primararily immunized because it not only prevents polio infection but also to other types of infection to which the children are generally susceptible.<br>
The formulations prepared according to the present invention may be administered through the route such as Oral, Transdermal, Injection, Nasal, Mucosal, Subcutaneous, Intramuscular and the like.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Polio is caused by three strains of quite stable viruses belonging to the family of entroviruses. There are different types of polio vaccines available   in  the   market.   These  vaccines  are  trivalent  containing   a<br>
mixture of all the three strains of polio virus so as to confer immunity against all of them.<br>
Although different types of polio vaccines are known in the art but there is no prior art disclosure of a polio vaccine formulation containing Sabin strain derived inactivated polio vaccine and other antigens effective against pathogens causing infections among children.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a stable and effective multivalent Polio Vaccine Formulations which on administration provides immunization not only against polio infection but also against other pathogens causing Hepatitis C, Hepatitis D, Hepatitis E, Meningitis A, Meningitis B, Meningitis C, Meningitis W, Meningitis Y, Smallpox, Typhoid, Bacille Camette Guerin, Tuberculosis, Human Immunodeficiency Virus, Anthrax or the like to which the children are generally susceptible.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a stable and effective multivalent Polio Vaccine formulations comprising Sabin strain derived inactivated polio vaccine and a number 'n' of other antigens, as herein described, wherein the value of n is 1 or greater than 1 and one or more conventional adjuvants.<br>
Preferably the value of 'n' is 1 to 10. More preferably the value of 'n' is 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6.<br>
The present invention also provides a process for the preparation of stable and effective multivalent Polio Vaccine Formulations which comprises mixing Sabin strain derived inactivated polio vaccine adsorbed on a conventional adjuvant with a number 'n' of other antigens as herein described, adsorbed on conventional adjuvant(s) wherein the value of n is one or greater than one.<br>
Preferably the value of 'n' is 1 to 10. More preferably the value of 'n' is 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6.<br>
The Sabin strain derived Polio vaccine used in the Formulations according to the present invention may be trivalent containing a mixture of all the three types namely Type 1, Type 2 and Type 3 of Polio virus or may be a mixture of any two said Types.<br>
The other antigens present in the Polio Vaccine Formulations according to the present invention are selected from those which provide immunity against one or more of the pathogens causing infections like Hepatitis C, Hepatitis D, Hepatitis E, Meningitis A, Meningitis B, Meningitis C, Meningitis W, Meningitis Y, Smallpox, Typhoid, Tuberculosis, Human Immunodeficiency Virus, Anthrax or the like to which the children are susceptible.<br>
As adjuvant(s), any Aluminium salt may be used. Preferably Aluminium Hydroxide or Aluminium Phosphate is used.<br>
The term 'multivalent' used herein means a vaccine formulation comprising more than two antigens, for example three, four, five or six antigens.<br>
The administration of the Polio Vaccine Formulations prepared according to the present invention would overcome or at least mitigate the problems associated with multiple injections of the different antigens. The Formulations provided by the present invention are stable and highly immunogenic which are particularly suitable for administration to children.<br>
ADVANTAGE OF THE POLIO VACCINE FORMULATIONS ACCORDING TO THE PRESENT INVENTION ARE :<br>
1.	Advantage of effective immunization against many diseases with single injection.<br>
2.	Sabin strain derived inactivated polio vaccine does not require growing of virulent strain of polio virus and hence its production process does not involve accidental release of live virulent polio viruses in the environment.<br>
3.	Sabin~~strain derived inactivated polio vaccine does not have disadvantages like vaccine associated paralytic poliomyelitis and vaccine derived virus.<br>
4.	Worldwide availability of production facilities.<br>
5.	Monovalent bulk available easily.<br>
6.	The Formulation combines the advantages of both Oral Polio Vaccine and Salk Inactivated Polio Vaccine.<br>
7. Sabin strain derived inactivated polio vaccine can be effectively combined with other antigens.<br>
The Polio vaccine prepared from Sabin strain, as stated above, may be stabilized &amp; inactivated, according to present invention, by the following process.<br>
STABILIZATION PROCESS:<br>
The monovalent bulk of poliovirus is to be initially stabilized by adding stabilizer like Sucrose or Trehalose or Arginine hydrochloride or Gelatin to retain the antigenicity of the vaccine   during inactivation process.<br>
INACTIVATION PROCESS:<br>
Inactivation process is to be initiated immediately. Inactivation  of each  of filtered  &amp;  purified  monovalent pool  is to  be carried     out     by     adding     formaldehyde     (formalin)     at     0.025% concentration and incubation upto 37°C upto 12 days.<br>
FORMULATION AND MANUFACTURING   OF THE VACCINE :<br>
The inactivated monovalent viruses may be mixed with stabilizer or/and preservative to make monovalent, bivalent or trivalent inactivated vaccine.<br>
The final vaccine may be spray dried &amp; resuspended in ready-to-inject liquids like perfluorocarbons, requiring no refrigeration for storage or preparation before injection.<br>
The present invention is illustrated by the following example<br>
EXAMPLE 1:	'<br>
The Polio vaccine obtained by the standardized methods is used to provide a vaccine formulation comprising sabin strain derived inactivated Polio vaccine ( SIPV ) and a number ( n ) of other antigens in combination with an adjuvant comprising one or more aluminium salts in which the value of n is 1 or greater than 1. Preferably n is 1 to 10. More preferably n is 2,3,4,5 or 6.<br>
EXAMPLE 2 :<br>
In another aspect, the invention provides a vaccine formulation comprising Sabin strain derived inactivated Polio vaccine (SIPV) absorbed to Aluminium Phosphate (AP) and an antigen absorbed to AP or to Aluminium Hydroxide (AH) or any other suitable adjuvant selected from an antigen providing immunity against one or more of the following pathogens :<br>
Hepatitis C, Hepatitis D, Hepatitis E, Meningitis A, Meningitis B, Meningitis C, Meningitis W, Meningitis Y, Smallpox, Typhoid, Bacille Calmette Guerin, Tuberculosis, Human Immunodeficiency Virus, Anthrax or the like.<br>
EXAMPLE 3 :<br>
In another formulation, SIPV compatible antigens like antigens against Meningitis B, Meningitis A and C, and otitis media may also be included.<br>
EXAMPLE 4 :<br>
In a further aspect of the invention tnere is proviaea a siauie emu<br>
effective vaccine formulation directed to the prevention of more than<br>
two diseases, comprising SIPV and at least two other antigens<br>
selected from Hepatitis C, Hepatitis D, Hepatitis E, Meningitis A,<br>
Meningitis B, Meningitis C, Meningitis W, Meningitis Y, Smallpox,<br>
Typhoid,    Tuberculosis,     Human     Immunodeficiency	Virus    and<br>
Anthrax.<br><br><br><br><br>
We claim:<br>
1.
