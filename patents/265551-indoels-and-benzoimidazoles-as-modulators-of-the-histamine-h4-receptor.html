				<td>INDOLES AND BENZOIMIDAZOLES AS HISTAMINE H4 RECEPTOR<br>
MODULATORS<br>
This application claims the benefit of US provisional patent application<br>
serial number 60/790,421, filed on April 7, 2006, which is incorporated herein by<br>
reference.<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to certain indole and benzoimidazole<br>
compounds, pharmaceutical compositions containing them, and methods of using<br>
them for the treatment of disease states;, disorders, and conditions mediated by<br>
histamine H4 receptor activity.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The histamine H4 receptor (H4R) is the most recently identified receptor for<br>
histamine (for reviews, see: Fung-Leung, W.-P., et al., Curr. Opin. Invest. Drugs<br>
2004, 5(11), 1174-1183; de Esch, I.J.P., et al., Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2005,<br>
26(9), 462-469). The receptor is found in the bone marrow and spleen and is<br>
expressed on eosinophils, basophils, mast cells (Liu, C, et al., Mol. Pharmacol.<br>
2001, 59(3), 420-426; Morse, K.L., et al., J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001, 296(3),<br>
1058-1066; Hofstra, C.L., et al., J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2003, 305(3). 1212-<br>
1221; Lippert. U.. et al., J. Invest. Dermatol. 2004, 123(1), 116-123; Voehringer,<br>
D., et al.. Immunity 2004, 20(3), 267-277), CD8* T cells (Gantner, F., et al., J.<br>
Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2002, 303(1), 300-307), dendritic cells, and human<br>
synovial cells from rheumatoid arthritis patients (Ikawa, Y., et al., Blol. Pharm.<br>
Bull. 2005, 28(10), 2016-2018). However, expression in neutrophils and<br>
monocytes is less well defined (Ling, P., tst al., Br. J. Pharmacol. 2004, 142(1).<br>
161-171). Receptor expression is at least, in part controlled by various<br>
inflammatory stimuli (Coge, F., et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001.<br>
284(2), 301-309; Morse, et al.. 2001), thus; supporting that H4 receptor activation<br>
influences inflammatory responses. Because of its preferential expression on<br>
immunocompetent cells, the H* receptor iss closely related with the regulatory<br>
functions of histamine during the immune response.<br>
A biological activity of histamine in the context of immunology and<br>
autoimmune diseases is closely related with the allergic response and its<br><br>
deleterious effects, such as inflammation. Events that elicit the inflammatory<br>
response include physical stimulation (including trauma), chemical stimulation,<br>
infection, and invasion by a foreign body. The inflammatory response is<br>
characterized by pain, increased temperature, redness, swelling, reduced<br>
function, or a combination of these.<br>
. Mast cell degranulation (exocytosis) releases histamine and leads to an<br>
inflammatory response that may be initially characterized by a histamine-<br>
modulated wheat and flare reaction. A wide variety of immunological stimuli (e.g.,<br>
allergens or antibodies) and non-immunological (e.g., chemical) stimuli may<br>
cause the activation, recruitment, and de-granulation of mast cells. Mast cell<br>
activation initiates allergic inflammatory responses, which in turn cause the<br>
recruitment of other effector cells that further contribute to the inflammatory<br>
response. It has been shown that histamine induces chemotaxis of mouse mast<br>
cells (Hofstra, et al., 2003). Chemotaxis does not occur using mast cells derived<br>
from H4 receptor knockout mice. Furthermore, the response is blocked by an H4-<br>
specific antagonist, but not by H-i, hfe or H3 receptor antagonists (Hofstra, et al.,<br>
2003; Thurmond, R.L., etal., J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2004. 309(1). 404-413).<br>
The in vivo migration of mast cells to histamine has also been investigated and<br>
shown to be H4 receptor dependent (Thurmond, et al., 2004). The migration of<br>
mast cells may play a role in allergic rhinitis and allergy where increases in mast<br>
cell number are found (Kirby, J.G., et al., Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1987,136(2),<br>
379-383; Crimi, E., et al., Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1991, 144(6), 1282-1286; Amin,<br>
K., et al., Am. J. Resp. Crit. Care Med. 2000, 162(6), 2295-2301; Gauvreau, G.M..<br>
et al., Am. J. Resp. Crit. Care Med. 2000,161(5), 1473-1478; Kassel, O., et al..<br>
Clin. Exp. Allergy 2001. 31(9). 1432-1440). In addition, it is known that in<br>
response to allergens there is a redistribution of mast cells to the epithelial lining<br>
of the nasal mucosa (Fokkens. W.J., el: al., Clin. Exp. Allergy 1992, 22(7), 701-<br>
710; Slater, A., et al., J. Laryngol. Otol. 1996,110, 929-933). These results show<br>
that the chemotactic response of mast cells is mediated by histamine H4<br>
receptors.<br>
It has been shown that eosinophils can chemotax towards histamine<br>
(O'Reilly, M., et al., J. Recept. Signal Transduction 2002, 22(1-4), 431-448;<br>
Buckland, K.F., et al., Br. J. Pharmacol 2003,140(6), 1117-1127; Ling et al..<br><br>
2004). Using H4 selective ligands, it has been shown that histamine-induced<br>
chemotaxis of eosinophils is mediated through the H4 receptor (Buckland, et al.,<br>
2003; Ling et al., 2004). Cell surface expression of adhesion molecules<br>
CD11b/CD18 (LFA-1) and CD54 (ICAM-1) on eosinophils increases after<br>
histamine treatment (Ling, et al., 2004). This increase is blocked by H4 receptor<br>
antagonists but not by H1, H2, or H3 receptor antagonists.<br>
The H4R also plays a role in dendritic cells and T cells. In human<br>
monocyte-derived dendritic cells, H4R stimulation suppresses IL-12p70 production<br>
and drives histamine-rnediated chemctaxis (Gutzmer, R., et al., J. Immunol. 2005,<br>
174(9), 5224-5232). A role for the H4 receptor in CD8* T cells has also been<br>
reported. Gantner, et al., (2002) showed that both H4 and hfe receptors control<br>
histamine-induced IL-16 release from hiuman CD8+ T cells. IL-16 is found in the<br>
bronchoalveolar fluid of allergen- or histamine-challenged asthmatics (Mashikian,<br>
V.M., et al., J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1998,101 (6, Part 1), 786-792; Krug, N., et<br>
al., Am. J. Resp. Crit. Care Med. 2000,162(1), 105-111) and is considered<br>
important in CD4* cell migration. The activity of the receptor in these cell types<br>
indicates an important role in adaptive immune responses such as those active in<br>
autoimmune diseases.<br>
In vivo H4 receptor antagonists were able to block neutrophillia in zymosan-<br>
induced peritonitis or pleurisy models (Takeshita, K., et al., J. Pharmacol. Exp.<br>
Ther. 2003, 307(3), 1072-1078; Thurmond, et al., 2004). In addition, H4 receptor<br>
antagonists have activity in a widely used and well-characterized model of colitis<br>
(Varga, C, et al.. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2005, 522(1-3), 130-138). These results<br>
support the conclusion that H4 receptor antagonists have the capacity to be anti-<br>
inflammatory in vivo.<br>
Another physiological role of hisiamine is as a mediator of itch and Hi<br>
receptor antagonists are not completely effective in the clinic. Recently, the H4<br>
receptor has also been implicated in hUstamine-induced scratching in mice (Bell,<br>
J.K., et al.. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2004,142(2), 374-380). The effects of histamine<br>
could be blocked by H4 antagonists. These results support the hypothesis that<br>
the H4 receptor is involved in histamine-induced itch and that H4 receptor<br>
antagonists will therefore have positive effects in treating pruritis.<br><br>
Modulation of H4 receptors controls the release of inflammatory mediators<br>
and inhibits leukocyte recruitment, thus providing the ability to prevent and/or treat<br>
H4-mediated diseases and conditions, including the deleterious effects of allergic<br>
responses such as inflammation. Compounds according to the present invention<br>
have H4 receptor modulating properties Compounds according to the present<br>
invention have leukocyte recruitment inhibiting properties. Compounds according<br>
to the present invention have anti-inflammatory properties.<br>

with inflammation can be found in articles such as the following: Nathan, C,<br>
Nature 2002, 420(6917), 846-852; Tracey. K.J., Nature 2002, 420(6917), 853-<br>

Thus, small-molecule histamine H«receptor modulators according to this<br>
invention control the release of inflammatory mediators and inhibit leukocyte<br>
recruitment, and may be useful in treating inflammation of various etiologies,<br>
including the following conditions and diseases: inflammatory disorders, allergic<br>
disorders, dermatological disorders, autoimmune disease, lymphatic disorders,<br>
pruritis, and immunodeficiency disorders. Diseases, disorders and medical<br>
conditions that are mediated by histamino H4 receptor activity include those<br>
referred to herein.<br>
Indole and benzoimidazole amides were disclosed as histamine H4<br>
receptor modulators in Intl. Patent Appl. Publ. No. WO02/072548 (Sept. 19,<br>
2002). 4-Pyrrolidino pyrimidines have also been disclosed as histamine H4<br>
receptor modulators (See, Intl. Patent Appl. Publ. Nos. WO05/014556 (Feb. 17,<br><br>
2005) and WO05/054239 (June 16,2005). However, there still remains a need<br>
for potent histamine H4 receptor modulators with desirable pharmaceutical<br>
properties.<br>

Any formula given herein is intended to represent compounds having<br>
structures depicted by the structural formula as well as certain variations or forms.<br>
In particular, compounds of any formuls given herein may have asymmetric<br>
centers and therefore exist in different enantiomeric forms. All optical isomers<br>
and stereoisomers of the compounds of the general formula, and mixtures<br>
thereof, are considered within the scope of the formula. Thus, any formula given<br>
herein is intended to represent a racemate, one or more enantiomeric forms, one<br>
or more diastereomeric forms, one or more atropisomeric forms, and mixtures<br>
thereof.<br>
Furthermore, certain structures may exist as geometric isomers (i.e., cis<br>
and trans isomers), as tautomers, or as atropisomers. Additionally, any formula<br>
given herein is intended to represent hydrates, solvates, and polymorphs of such<br>
compounds, and mixtures thereof.<br>
The symbols »■■■■ and "■^— are used as meaning the same spatial<br>
arrangement in chemical structures shown herein. Analogously, the symbols<br>
	•■"&gt;&gt; and "••"	■ are used as meaning the same spatial arrangement in<br>
chemical structures shown herein.<br>
To provide a more concise description, some of the quantitative<br>
expressions given herein are not qualified with the term "about". It is understood<br>
that, whether the term "about" is used explicitly or not, every quantity given herein<br>
is meant to refer to the actual given value, and it is also meant to refer to the<br>
approximation to such given value that would reasonably be inferred based on the<br>
ordinary skill in the art, including equivalents and approximations due to the<br>
experimental and/or measurement conditions for such given value. Whenever a<br>
yield is given as a percentage, such yield refers to a mass of the entity for which<br>
the yield is given with respect to the maximum amount of the same entity that<br><br>
could be obtained under the particular stoichiometric conditions. Concentrations<br>
that are given as percentages refer to mass ratios, unless indicated differently.<br>
Reference to a chemical entity herein stands for a reference to any one of:<br>
(a) the actually recited form of such chemical entity, and (b) any of the forms of<br>
such chemical entity in the medium in which the compound is being considered<br>
when named. For example, reference herein to a compound such as R-COOH,<br>
encompasses reference to any one of, for example, R-COOH(S), R-COOH(80)), and<br>
R-COO'(8Oi). in this example, R-COOH[S) refers to the solid compound, as it could<br>
be for example in a tablet or some other solid pharmaceutical composition or<br>
preparation; R-COOH<soo refers to the undissociated form of compound in a></soo>
solvent; and R-COO"(5Oi) refers to the dissociated form of the compound in a<br>
solvent, such as the dissociated form of the compound in an aqueous<br>
environment, whether such dissociated form derives from R-COOH, from a salt<br>
thereof, or from any other entity that yields R-COO" upon dissociation in the<br>
medium being considered. In another example, an expression such as "exposing<br>
an entity to compound of formula R-COOH" refers to the exposure of such entity<br>
to the form, or forms, of the compound R-COOH that exists, or exist, in the<br>
medium in which such exposure takes place. In this regard, if such entity is for<br>
example in an aqueous environment, it is understood that the compound R-<br>
COOH is in such same medium, and therefore the entity is being exposed to<br>
species such as R-COOH(aq)and/or R-COO(aq), where the subscript "(aq)"stands<br>
for "aqueous" according to its conventional meaning in chemistry and<br>
biochemistry. A carboxylic acid functional group has been chosen in these<br>
nomenclature examples; this choice is not intended, however, as a limitation but it<br>
is merely an illustration. It is understood that analogous examples can be<br>
provided in terms of other functional groups, including but not limited to hydroxyl,<br>
basic nitrogen members, such as those in amines, and any other group that<br>
interacts or transforms according to known manners in the medium that contains<br>
the compound. Such interactions and transformations include, but are not limited<br>
to, dissociation, association, tautomerism, solvolysis, including hydrolysis,<br>
solvation, including hydration, protonation, and deprotonation. No further<br>
examples in this regard are provided herein because these interactions and<br><br>
transformations in a given medium are known by any one of ordinary skill in the<br>

Any formula given herein is also intended to represent unlabefed forms as<br>
well as isotopically labeled forms of the compounds. Isotopically labeled<br>
compounds have structures depicted by the formulas given herein except that<br>
one or more atoms are replaced by an atom having a selected atomic mass or<br>
mass number. Examples of isotopes that can be incorporated into compounds of<br>
the invention include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen,<br>
phosphorous, fluorine, chlorine, and iodine, such as 2H, 3H, 11C, 13C, 14C, 15N. 18O,<br>
ITO 3ip 32p 35S iaF 36C, 125^ respectively. Such isotopically labelled<br>
compounds are useful in metabolic studies (preferably with 14C), reaction kinetic<br>
studies (with, for example 2H or 3H), detection or Imaging techniques [such as<br>
positron emission tomography (PET) or single-photon emission computed<br>
tomography (SPECT)] including drug or substrate tissue distribution assays, or in<br>
radioactive treatment of patients. In particular, an 18F or 11C labeled compound<br>
may be particularly preferred for PET or SPECT studies. Further, substitution<br>
with heavier isotopes such as deuterium (i.e., 2H) may afford certain therapeutic<br>
advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability, for example increased in<br>
vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements. Isotopically labeled compounds of<br>
this invention and prodrugs thereof can generally be prepared by carrying out the<br>
procedures disclosed in the schemes or in the examples and preparations<br>
described below by substituting a readily available isotopically labeled reagent for<br>
a non-isotopically labeled reagent.<br>
When referring to any formula given herein, the selection of a particular<br>
moiety from a list of possible species for a specified variable is not intended to<br>
define the same choice of the species for the variable appearing elsewhere. In<br>
other words, where a variable appears more than once, the choice of the species<br>
from a specified list is independent of the choice of the species for the same<br>
variable elsewhere in the formula, unless stated otherwise.<br>

the possible embodiments of subsets of the set referred to explicitly.<br><br>
The invention includes also pharrr aceutically acceptable salts of the<br>
compounds represented by Formula (i), preferably of those described above and<br>
of the specific compounds exemplified herein.<br>
A "pharmaceutically acceptable salt" is intended to mean a salt of a free<br>
acid or base of a compound represented by Formula (I) that is non-toxic,<br>
biologically tolerable, or otherwise biologically suitable for administration to the<br><br>
subject. See, generally, S.M. Berge, et al., "Pharmaceutical Salts", J. Pharm.<br>
Sci.. 1977, 66:1-19. and Handbook of Pharmaceutical Salts, Properties,<br>
Selection, and Use, Stahl and Wermuth, Eds., Wiley-VCH and VHCA, Zurich,<br>
2002. Examples of pharfnaceutically acceptable salts are those that are<br>
pharmacologically effective and suitable for contact with the tissues of patients<br>
without undue toxicity, irritation, or allergic response. A compound of Formula (I)<br>
may possess a sufficiently acidic group, a sufficiently basic group, or both types of<br>
functional groups, and accordingly read with a number of inorganic or organic<br>
bases, and inorganic and organic acids, to form a pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
salt. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts include sulfates,<br>
pyrosulfates, bisulfates, sulfites, bisulfites, phosphates, monohydrogen-<br>
phosphates, dihydrogenphosphates, metaphosphates, pyrophosphates,<br>
chlorides, bromides, iodides, acetates, propionates, decanoates, caprytates,<br>
acrylates, formates, isobutyrates, caproates, heptanoates. propiolates, oxalates,<br>
malonates, succinates, suberates, sebacates, fumarates, maleates, butyne-1,4-<br>
dioates, hexyne-1,6-dioates, benzoates chlorobenzoates, methylbenzoates,<br>
dinitrobenzoates, hydroxybenzoates, rmthoxybenzoates, phthalates, sulfonates,<br>
xylenesulfonates, phenylacetates, phenylpropionates, phenylbutyrates, citrates,<br>
lactates, v-hydroxybutyrates, glycolates, tartrates, methane-sulfonates,<br>
propanesulfonates, naphthalene-1-sulfcnates, naphthalene-2-sulfonates, and<br>
mandelates.<br>
If the compound of Formula (I) contains a basic nitrogen, the desired<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salt may bo prepared by any suitable method<br>
available in the art, for example, treatment of the free base with an inorganic acid,<br>
such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, sulfamic acid, nitric<br>
acid, boric acid, phosphoric acid, and the like, or with an organic acid, such as<br>
acetic acid, phenylacetic acid, propionic acid, stearic acid, lactic acid, ascorbic<br>
acid, malelc acid, hydroxymaleic acid, isethionic acid, succinic acid, valeric acid,<br>
fumaric acid, malonic acid, pyruvic acid, oxalic acid, glycolic acid, salicylic acid,<br>
oleic acid, palmitic acid, lauric acid, a pyranosidyl acid, such as glucuronic acid or<br>
galacturonic acid, an alpha-hydroxy acid, such as mandelic acid, citric acid, or<br>
tartaric acid, an amino acid, such as aspartic acid or glutamic acid, an aromatic<br>
acid, such as benzoic acid, 2-acetoxybenzoic acid, naphthoic acid, or cinnamic<br><br>
acid, a sulfonic acid, such as laurylsulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid,<br>
methanesulfonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, any compatible mixture of acids such<br>
as those given as examples herein, and any other acid and mixture thereof that<br>
are regarded as equivalents or acceptable substitutes in light of the ordinary level<br>
of skill in this technology.<br>
If the compound of Formula (I) is an acid, such as a carboxylic acid or<br>
sulfonic acid, the desired pharmaceutically acceptable salt may be prepared by<br>
any suitable method, for example, treatment of the free acid with an inorganic or<br>
organic base, such as an amine (primaiy, secondary or tertiary), an alkali metal<br>
hydroxide, alkaline earth metal hydroxide, any compatible mixture of bases such<br>
as those given as examples herein, anc any other base and mixture thereof that<br>
are regarded as equivalents or acceptable substitutes in light of the ordinary level<br>
of skill in this technology. Illustrative examples of suitable salts include organic<br>
salts derived from amino acids, such as glycine and arginine, ammonia,<br>
carbonates, bicarbonates, primary, secondary, and tertiary amines, and cyclic<br>
amines, such as benzylamines, pyrrolidines, piperidine, morpholine, and<br>
piperazine, and inorganic salts derived from sodium, calcium, potassium,<br>
magnesium, manganese, iron, copper, zinc, aluminum, and lithium.<br>
The invention also relates to treatment methods employing<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable prodrugs of the compounds of Formula (I). The term<br>
"prodrug" means a precursor of a designated compound that, following<br>
administration to a subject, yields the compound in vivo via a chemical or<br>
physiological process such as solvolysis or enzymatic cleavage, or under<br>
physiological conditions (e.g., a prodrug on being brought to physiological pH is<br>
converted to the compound of Formula (I)). A "pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
prodrug" is a prodrug that is not toxic, biologically intolerable, or otherwise<br>
biologically unsuitable for administration to the subject. Illustrative procedures for<br>
the selection and preparation of suitable prodrug derivatives are described, for<br>
example, in "Design of Prodrugs", ed. H. Bundgaard, Elsevier, 1985.<br>
Examples of prodrugs include compounds having an amino acid residue,<br>
or a polypeptide chain of two or more (e.g., two, three or four) amino acid<br>
residues, covalently joined through an amide or ester bond to a free amino,<br>
hydroxy, or carboxylic acid group of a compound of Formula (I). Examples of<br><br>
amino acid residues include the twenty naturally occurring amino acids,<br>
commonly designated by three letter symbols, as well as 4-hydroxyprotine,<br>
hydroxylysine, demosine, isodemosine, 3-methylhistidine, norvalin, beta-alanine,<br>
gamma-aminobutyric acid, citrulline homocysteine, homoserine, omithine and<br>
methionine sulfone.<br>
Additional types of prodrugs may be produced, for instance, by derivatizing<br>
free carboxyl groups of structures of Formula (I) as amides or alkyl esters.<br>
Examples of amides include those derived from ammonia, primary C1-6alkyl<br>
amines and secondary di(C1-6alkyl) amines. Secondary amines include 5- or 6-<br>
membered heterocycloalkyl or heteroaryl ring moieties. Examples of amides<br>
include those that are derived from ammonia. C1-3alkyl primary amines, and di(C1-3<br>
2alkyl)amines. Examples of esters of the invention include C1-7alkyl, C5-<br>
7cycloalkyl, phenyl, and phenyl(C1-6alkyl) esters. Preferred esters include methyl<br>
esters. Prodrugs may also be prepared by derivatizing free hydroxy groups using<br>
groups including hemisuccinates, phosphate esters, dimethylaminoacetates, and<br>
phosphoryloxymethyloxycarbonyls, following procedures such as those outlined in<br>
Adv. Drug Delivery Rev. 1996, 19, 115. Carbamate derivatives of hydroxy and<br>
amino groups may also yield prodrugs. Carbonate derivatives, sulfonate esters,<br>
and sulfate esters of hydroxy groups may also provide prodrugs. Derivatization of<br>
hydroxy groups as (acyloxy)methyl and (acyloxy)ethyl ethers, wherein the acyl<br>
group may be an alkyl ester, optionally substituted with one or more ether, amine,<br>
or carboxylic acid functionalities, or where the acyl group is an amino acid ester<br>
as described above, is also useful to yield prodrugs. Prodrugs of this type may be<br>
prepared as described in J. Med. Chem. 1996, 39,10. Free amines can also be<br>
derivatlzed as amides, sulfonamides or p hosphonamides. All of these prodrug<br>
moieties may incorporate groups including ether, amine, and carboxylic acid<br>
functionalities.<br>
Pharmaceutically active metabolites may also be used in the methods of<br>
the invention. A "pharmaceutically active metabolite" means a pharmacologically<br>
active product of metabolism in the body of a compound of Formula (I) or salt<br>
thereof. Prodrugs and active metabolites of a compound may be determined<br>
using routine techniques known or available in the art. See, e.g., Bertolini, et al.,<br>
J. Med. Chem. 1997, 40, 2011-2016; Shan, et al., J. Pham. Sci. 1997. 86 (7).<br><br>

The compounds of Formula (I) and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts,<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable prodrugs, and pharmaceutically active metabolites<br>
(collectively, "agents") of the present invention are useful as histamine H4<br>
receptor modulators in the methods of the invention. The agents may be used in<br>
the inventive methods for the treatment or prevention of medical conditions,<br>
diseases, or disorders mediated through modulation of the histamine H4 receptor,<br>
such as those described herein. Agents; according to the invention may therefore<br>
be used as an anti-inflammatory agents. Symptoms or disease states are<br>
intended to be included within the scope of "medical conditions, disorders, or<br>
diseases."<br>
Accordingly, the invention relates to methods of using the pharmaceutical<br>
agents described herein to treat subjects; diagnosed with or suffering from a<br>
disease, disorder, or condition mediated through histamine H4 receptor activity,<br>
such as inflammation.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, an agent of the present invention is<br>
administered to treat inflammation. Inflammation may be associated with various<br>
diseases, disorders, or conditions, such as inflammatory disorders, allergic<br>
disorders, dermatological disorders, autoimmune disease, lymphatic disorders,<br>
and immunodeficiency disorders, including the more specific conditions and<br>
diseases given below. Regarding the onset and evolution of inflammation,<br>
inflammatory diseases or inflammation-mediated diseases or conditions include,<br>
but are not limited to, acute inflammation, allergic inflammation, and chronic<br>
inflammation.<br>
Illustrative types of inflammation treatable with a histamine H4 receptor-<br>
modulating agent according to the invention include inflammation due to any one<br>
of a plurality of conditions such as allergy, asthma, chronic obstructed pulmonary<br>
disease (COPD), atherosclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis,<br>
inflammatory bowel diseases (including colitis, Crohn's disease, and ulcerative<br>
colitis), psoriasis, pruritis, itchy skin, atopic dermatitis, urticaria (hives), ocular<br><br>
inflammation, conjunctivitis, nasal polyps, allergic rhinitis, nasal itch, scloroderitia,<br>
autoimmune thyroid diseases, immume-mediated (also known as type 1) diabetes<br>
mellitus and lupus, which are characterized by excessive or prolonged<br>
inflammation at some stage of the disease. Other autoimmune diseases that lead<br>
to inflammation include Myasthenia gnavis, autoimmune neuropathies, such as<br>
Guillain-Barre, autoimmune uveitis, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, pernicious<br>
anemia, autoimmune thrombocytopenia, temporal arteritis, anti-phospholipid<br>
syndrome, vasculitides, such as wegener's granulomatosis, Behcefs disease,<br>
dermatitis herpetiformis, pemphigus vuigaris, vitiligio, primary biliary cirrhosis,<br>
autoimmune hepatitis, autoimmune oophoritis and orchitis, autoimmune disease<br>
of the adrenal gland, polymyositis, dermatomyositis, spondyloarthropathies, such<br>
as ankylosing spondylitis, and Sjogren'j, syndrome.<br>
Pruritis with a histamine H4 receptor-modulating agent according to the<br>
invention includes that which is a symptom of allergic cutaneous diseases (such<br>
as atopic dermatitis and hives) and other metabolic disorders (such as chronic<br>
renal failure, hepatic cholestasis, and diabetes mellitus).<br>
In another preferred embodiment, an agent of the present invention is<br>
administered to treat allergy, asthma, autoimmune diseases, or pruritis.<br>
The term "treat" or "treating" as used herein is intended to refer to<br>
administration of an agent or composition of the invention to a subject for the<br>
purpose of effecting a therapeutic or prophylactic benefit through modulation of<br>
histamine H4 receptor activity. Treating includes reversing, ameliorating,<br>
alleviating, inhibiting the progress of, less ening the severity of, or preventing a<br>
disease, disorder, or condition, or one or more symptoms of such disease,<br>
disorder or condition mediated through modulation of histamine H4 receptor<br>
activity. The term "subject" refers to a mammalian patient in need of such<br>
treatment, such as a human. "Modulators" include both inhibitors and activators,<br>
where "inhibitors" refer to compounds that decrease, prevent, inactivate,<br>
desensitize or down-regulate histamine H4 receptor expression or activity, and<br>
"activators" are compounds that increase, activate, facilitate, sensitize, or up-<br>
regulate histamine H4 receptor expression or activity.<br><br>
In treatment methods according to the invention, an effective amount of at<br>
least one pharmaceutical agent according to the invention is administered to a<br>
subject suffering from or diagnosed as having such a disease, disorder, or<br>
condition. An "effective amount" means an amount or dose sufficient to generally<br>
bring about the desired therapeutic or prophylactic benefit in patients in need of<br>
such treatment for the designated disease, disorder, or condition. Effective<br>
amounts or doses of the agents of the present invention may be ascertained by<br>
routine methods such as modeling, dose escalation studies or clinical trials, and<br>
by taking into consideration routine factors, e.g., the mode or route of<br>
administration or drug delivery, the pharmacokinetics of the agent, the severity<br>
and course of the disease, disorder, or condition, the subject's previous or<br>
ongoing therapy, the subject's health status and response to drugs, and the<br>
judgment of the treating physician. An example of a dose is in the range of from<br>
about 0.001 to about 200 mg of agent per kg of subject's body weight per day,<br>
preferably about 0.05 to 100 mg/kg/day, or about 1 to 35 mg/kg/day, in single or<br>
divided dosage units (e.g., BID, TID, QID). Fora 70-kg human, an illustrative<br>
range for a suitable dosage amount is from about 0.05 to about 7 g/day, or about<br>
0.2 to about 2.5 g/day.<br>
Once improvement of the patient's disease, disorder, or condition has<br>
occurred, the dose may be adjusted for preventative or maintenance treatment.<br>
For example, the dosage or the frequency of administration, or both, may be<br>
reduced as a function of the symptoms., to a level at which the desired therapeutic<br>
or prophylactic effect is maintained. Of course, if symptoms have been alleviated<br>
to an appropriate level, treatment may cease. Patients may, however, require<br>
intermittent treatment on a long-term basis upon any recurrence of symptoms.<br>
In addition, the agents of the invention may be used in combination with<br>
additional active compounds in the treatment of the above conditions. The<br>
additional compounds may be coadministered separately with an agent of<br>
Formula (I) or included with such an agent as an additional active ingredient in a<br>
pharmaceutical composition according to the invention. In an illustrative<br>
embodiment, additional active compounds are those that are known or discovered<br>
to be effective in the treatment of conditions, disorders, or diseases mediated by<br>
histamine H4 receptor activity, such as another histamine H4 receptor modulator<br><br>
or a compound active against another target associated with the particular<br>
condition, disorder, or disease. The combination may serve to increase efficacy<br>
(e.g., by including in the combination a compound potentiating the potency or<br>
effectiveness of an agent according to the invention), decrease one or more side<br>
effects, or decrease the required dose of the agent according to the invention.<br>
When referring to modulating the target receptor, an "effective amount"<br>
means an amount sufficient to affect the activity of such receptor. Measuring the<br>
activity of the target receptor may be performed by routine analytical methods.<br>
Target receptor modulation is useful in a variety of settings, including assays.<br>
The agents of the invention are uised, alone or in combination with one or<br>
more other active ingredients, to formulate pharmaceutical compositions of the<br>
invention. A pharmaceutical composition of the invention comprises: (a) an<br>
effective amount of at least one pharmaceutical agent in accordance with the<br>
invention; and (b) a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient.<br>
A "pharmaceutically acceptable excipient" refers to a substance that is not<br>
toxic, biologically intolerable, or otherwises biologically unsuitable for administration<br>
to a subject, such as an inert substance, added to a pharmacological composition<br>
or otherwise used as a vehicle, carrier, or diluent to facilitate administration of a<br>
pharmaceutical agent and that is compatible therewith. Examples of excipients<br>
include calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate, various sugars and types of<br>
starch, cellulose derivatives, gelatin, vegetable oils, and polyethylene glycols.<br>
Delivery forms of the pharmaceutical compositions containing one or more<br>
dosage units of the pharmaceutical agents may be prepared using suitable<br>
pharmaceutical excipients and compounding techniques known or that become<br>
available to those skilled in the art. The compositions may be administered in the<br>
inventive methods by a suitable route of delivery, e.g., oral, parenteral, rectal,<br>
topical, or ocular routes, or by inhalation.<br>
The preparation may be in the form of tablets, capsules, sachets, dragees,<br>
powders, granules, lozenges, powders for reconstitution, liquid preparations, or<br>
suppositories. Preferably, the compositions are formulated for intravenous<br>
infusion, topical administration, or oral administration.<br>
For oral administration, the compounds of the invention can be provided in<br>
the form of tablets or capsules, or as a solution, emulsion, or suspension. To<br><br>
prepare the oral compositions, the agents may be formulated to yield a dosage of,<br>
e.g., from about 0.05 to about 50 mg/kg daily, or from about 0.05 to about 20<br>
mg/kg daily, or from about 0.1 to about 10 mg/kg daily.<br>
Oral tablets may include the agent and any other active ingredients mixed<br>
with compatible pharmaceutically acceptable excipients such as diluents,<br>
disintegrating agents, binding agents, lubricating agents, sweetening agents,<br>
flavoring agents, coloring agents and preservative agents. Suitable inert fillers<br>
include sodium and calcium carbonates, sodium and calcium phosphate, lactose,<br>
starch, sugar, glucose, methyl cellulose, magnesium stearate, mannitol, sorbitol,<br>
and the like. Examples of liquid oral excipients include ethanol, glycerol, water,<br>
and the like. Starch, polyvinyl-pyrrolidone (PVP), sodium starch glycolate,<br>
microcrystalline cellulose, and alginic acid are examples of disintegrating agents.<br>
Binding agents may include starch and gelatin. The lubricating agent, if present,<br>
may be magnesium stearate, stearic acid or talc. If desired, the tablets may be<br>
coated with a material such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate to<br>
delay absorption in the gastrointestinal tract, or may be coated with an enteric<br>
coating.<br>
Capsules for oral administration include hard and soft gelatin capsules. To<br>
prepare hard gelatin capsules, active ingredient may be mixed with a solid, semi-<br>
solid, or liquid diluent. Soft gelatin capsules may be prepared by mixing the active<br>
ingredient with water, an oil such as peanut oil or olive oil, liquid paraffin, a<br>
mixture of mono and di-glycerides of short chain fatty acids, polyethylene glycol<br>
400, or propylene glycol.<br>
Liquids for oral administration may be in the form of suspensions,<br>
solutions, emulsions or syrups or may be lyophilized or presented as a dry<br>
product for reconstitution with water or other suitable vehicle before use. Such<br>
liquid compositions may optionally contain: pharmaceutically-acceptable<br>
excipients such as suspending agents (for example, sorbitol, methyl cellulose,<br>
sodium alginate, gelatin, hydroxyethylcellulose, carboxymethylcellulose, aluminum<br>
stearate gel and the like); non-aqueous vehicles, e.g., oil (for example, almond oil<br>
or fractionated coconut oil), propylene glycol, ethyl alcohol, or water, preservatives<br>
(for example, methyl or propyl p-hydroxybenzoate or sorbic acid); wetting agents<br>
such as lecithin; and, if desired, flavoring or coloring agents.<br><br>
The active agents of this invention may also be administered by non-oral<br>
routes. For example, the compositions may be formulated for rectal<br>
administration as a suppository. For parenteral use, including intravenous,<br>
intramuscular, intraperitoneal, or subcutaneous routes, the agents of the invention<br>
may be provided in sterile aqueous solutions or suspensions, buffered to an<br>
appropriate pH and isotonicity or in parenterally acceptable oil. Suitable aqueous<br>
vehicles include Ringer's solution and isotonic sodium chloride. Such forms may<br>
be presented in unit-dose form such as ampules or disposable injection devices,<br>
in multi-dose forms such as vials from which the appropriate dose may be<br>
withdrawn, or in a solid form or pre-concentrate that can be used to prepare an<br>
injectable formulation. Illustrative infusion doses range from about 1 to 1000<br>
ng/kg/minute of agent, admixed with a pharmaceutical carrier over a period<br>
ranging from several minutes to several days<br>
For topical administration, the agents may be mixed with a pharmaceutical<br>
carrier at a concentration of about 0.1% to about 10% of drug to vehicle. Another<br>
mode of administering the agents of the invention may utilize a patch formulation<br>
to affect transdermal delivery.<br>
Agents may alternatively be administered in methods of this invention by<br>
inhalation, via the nasal or oral routes, e.g., in a spray formulation also containing<br>
a suitable carrier.<br>
Examples of agents useful in methods of the invention will now be<br>
described by reference to illustrative synthetic schemes for their general<br>
preparation below and the specific examples that follow. Artisans will recognize<br>
that, to obtain the various compounds herein, starting materials may be suitably<br>
selected so that the ultimately desired substituents will be carried through the<br>
reaction scheme with or without protection as appropriate to yield the desired<br>
product. Alternatively, it may be necessary or desirable to employ, in the place of<br>
the ultimately desired substituent, a suitable group that may be carried through<br>
the reaction scheme and replaced as appropriate with the desired substituent.<br>
Unless otherwise specified, the variables are as defined above in reference to<br>
Formula (I).<br><br><br>
Referring to Scheme A, compounds of Formula (I) are prepared by amide<br>
coupling procedures known to one skilled in the art. For example, acids (V) are<br>
 coupled with amines (VI) directly, in the presence of an activating agent such as<br>
1,1'-carbonyl-diimidazole (CDI), bromotripyrrolidinophosphonium<br>
hexafluorophsphate (PyBroP), O-(7-azabenzotriazol-1-yl)-N,N,N',N'-<br>
tetramethyluronium phosphate (HATU), 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-<br>
ethylcarbodiimide/1-hydroxybenzotriazoHe (EDC/HOBt), and the like.<br>
 Alternatively, acids (V) are activated as mixed anhydrides or acid chlorides, and<br>
then coupled with amines (VI) in the presence of a suitable base such as<br>
triethylamine (TEA), iPr2NEt, pyridine, imidazole, or the like. Suitable amino<br>
protecting groups may be used in place of R3 and/or R4 and removed following<br>
the coupling.<br>
	Compounds prepared according to the schemes described above may be<br>
obtained as single enantiomers, diasteretomers, or regioisomers, or as racemic<br>
mixtures or mixtures of enantiomers, diastereomers, or regioisomers. Where<br>
regioisomeric or diastereomeric mixtures! are obtained, isomers may be separated<br>
using conventional methods such as chromatography or crystallization. Where<br>
 racemic (1:1) and non-racemic (not 1:1) mixtures of enantiomers are obtained,<br>

Biological Testing:<br>
Binding Assay on Recombtnant Human Histamine H4 Receptor<br>
SK-N-MC cells or COS7 cells were transiently transfected with pH4R and<br>
grown in 150 cm2 tissue culture dishes. Cells were washed with saline solution,<br>
scraped with a cell scraper and collected by centrifugation (1000 rpm, 5 min).<br>
Cell membranes were prepared by homogenization of the cell pellet in 20 mM<br>
Tris-HCI with a polytron tissue homogeni2:er for 10 sec at high speed.<br>
Homogenate was centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 5 min at 4 "C. The supernatant<br>
was then collected and centrifuged at 20,000 x g for 25 min at 4 "C. The final<br>
pellet was resuspended in 50 mM Tris-HGI. Cell membranes were incubated with<br>
H-histamine (5-70 nM) in the presence or absence of excess histamine (10,000<br>
nM). Incubation occurred at room temperature for 45 min. Membranes were<br>
harvested by rapid filtration over Whatman GF/C filters and washed 4 times with<br>
ice-cold 50 mM Tris HCI. Filters were then dried, mixed with scintillant and<br>
3«<br><br>
counted for radioactivity. SK-N-MC or COS7 cells expressing human histamine<br>
H4 receptor were used to measure the affinity of binding of other compounds and<br>
3<br>
their ability to displace H-ligand binding by incubating the above-described<br>
reaction in the presence of various concentrations of inhibitor or compound to be<br>
tested. For competition binding studies using 3H-histamine, K| values were<br>
