The invention relates to a card receiving device, in particular<br>
for, a tachograph in a motor vehicle of a flat construction,<br>
which completely draws in a card in a plane of movement, with<br>
an elongate receiving opening, through which the card reaches<br>
the card receiving device, and with a closure, which has a<br>
closure element, which extends in the longitudinal direction of<br>
the receiving opening and blocks the receiving opening in the<br>
closed position of the closure, the closure element being<br>
movable in a direction normal to the plane of movement within<br>
the travel required for the reception of the card.<br>
The main focus of application of the device according to the<br>
invention lies in the area of tachographs or devices for<br>
recording the working periods and rest periods of commercial<br>
vehicle drivers. However, other applications are likewise<br>
feasible, for example in the area of banking and for making<br>
payments, or locking systems. The invention is advantageously<br>
used in combination with all types of card-like data storage<br>
media. On account of the great commercial and legal importance<br>
of the data which can be acquired with tachographs, the<br>
recordings have to be reliably secured against manipulation.<br>
The security measures relate both to data acquisition and data<br>
transmission and to the transmission and storage of the<br>
acquired data in the memory of the card. Relevant standards<br>
place strict requirements on the security standard to be<br>
achieved by the measures. It is therefore stipulated that the<br>
card should be entirely held by the card receiving device<br>
during the reading and writing operations<br><br>
PCT/EP2004/003137	- 2 -<br>
2003P02903WOUS<br>
and be isolated from the surroundings by means of suitable<br>
closure devices. The closure devices have to be arrested in<br>
the closed position during the reading and writing operations.<br>
Additional difficulties arise on account of operational<br>
failures in conventional devices caused by contamination, in<br>
particular by contact being interrupted or even when the card<br>
is being drawn in. It is problematical to draw in the card and<br>
position it exactly on the contacts of the device because the<br>
cards have high manufacturing tolerances in relation to the<br>
required positional accuracy with respect to the contacts of<br>
the device. Since the cards are predominantly perceived by the<br>
user to be distinguished by a high degree of robustness, said<br>
cards are generally not handled with the care that is actually<br>
required, so that, in addition to the tolerances caused by<br>
manufacture, deformation and damage impair the way in which the<br>
card operates when interacting with the card receiving devices.<br>
Furthermore, the operating conditions in motor vehicles place<br>
increased requirements on functional reliability on account of<br>
the pronounced vibrations and countless bumps and the wide-<br>
ranging temperature fluctuations. Implementing security<br>
against manipulation and the desired handling convenience mean<br>
it is necessary to draw in the card fully automatically.<br>
However, in order to meet this requirement, great difficulties<br>
are faced in terms of construction because the installation<br>
space available in a tachograph, which is the size of a car<br>
radio, provides only approximately a height of 10 mm for the<br>
fully automatic drawing-in process. An important application<br>
of the invention lies in the area of commercial vehicles, in<br>
particular transporters of hazardous materials, for which<br>
relevant protection classes are of central significance. For<br>
instance, protection against dust deposits, complete protection<br>
against contact with<br><br>
PCT/EP2004/003137	- 3 -<br>
2003P02903WOUS<br>
live or internal moving parts, protection against penetration<br>
by dust' or protection against penetration by water splashing<br>
against the device from all directions is prescribed as an<br>
imperative requirement. These boundary conditions place<br>
special requirements on a closure of the receiving opening of a<br>
card receiving device.<br>
European Patent Application EP 1 017 013 A3 already discloses a<br>
closing device for a device of a similar generic type in which<br>
a segmented drum blocks or releases the opening, the drum being<br>
controlled and driven by means of a suitable gear mechanism.<br>
On account of the great structural and production engineering<br>
complexity, the solution is not suitable for mass production.<br>
European Patent Specification EP 0 342 407 Bl already discloses<br>
a device in which a closure is movable in the generic way, but<br>
the proposed solution is extremely complex.<br>
DE 35 18 247 Al describes a locking and unlocking device for a<br>
card reader in which the card is arrested by means of a hook<br>
during the reading mode. The hook protrudes into the receiving<br>
slot and partially blocks the latter. To release the<br>
arrestment for the withdrawal of the card, the hook must be<br>
turned by means of a complex lever device.<br>
FR 2 801 393 A discloses a portable card reader which is<br>
integrated in particular in a cellphone. The card reader is<br>
designed in such a way that, in the absence of a card, no dust<br>
can penetrate. In place of an open insertion slot for the<br>
card, a flap which bears against a stop edge is provided<br>
instead. The card is pushed in between the flap and the stop<br>
edge, but remains partly outside the card reader.<br>
Devices of the generic type with a guillotine-like closing<br>
movement are nowadays found in most automated teller machines.<br>
The safety requirements in the case of these devices are<br>
comparable or even more stringent, manipulation being made more<br><br>
PCT/EP2004/003137	- 3a-<br>
2003P02903WOUS<br>
difficult already by the fact that these devices are under<br>
constant surveillance. However, the known technique cannot be<br>
transferred to a tachograph, because it does not meet the<br>
requirements in terms of installation space.<br>
On the basis of the practical requirements and the problems and<br>
disadvantages of the prior art, it is the object of the<br>
invention to close a card receiving device by means of a<br>
closure in conformity with relevant protection classes, with at<br>
the same time a high degree of suitability for mass<br><br>
PCT/EP2004/003137	- 4-<br>
2003P02903WOUS<br>
production, low production tolerances and a reliable operating<br>
mode.<br>
The object is achieved according to the invention by a card<br>
receiving device as claimed in patent claim 1. The decisive<br>
advantage of the invention lies in the incomparably low<br>
complexity of the resilient mounting, which makes all<br>
additional mechanical components, in particular gear<br>
components, superfluous to the greatest extent. On account of<br>
its low structural complexity, the very simple solution is<br>
accompanied by great reliability and low production costs. At<br>
the same time as saving mechanically complex gear components,<br>
the installation space for the closure is reduced considerably,<br>
which is of extremely great interest in particular in the case<br>
of the installation space given in the area of motor vehicle<br>
tachographs, similar to the format of a car radio. An<br>
outstanding operating mode of the closure can be obtained with<br>
an overall height of less than 10 mm without involving any<br>
special complexity in terms of production engineering.<br>
Without complex linear guidance but by means of an axis of<br>
rotation that is arranged away from the closure element, a<br>
reliable function can be obtained in this way at low cost.  By<br>
contrast with<br><br>
PCT/EP2004/003137	- 5<br>
2003P02903WOUS<br>
linear guidance of the closure element, the mounting in an axis<br>
of rotation does not have any tendency to block, since the<br>
torques in the mounting increase with increasing distance from<br>
the closure element. Nevertheless, on account of the small<br>
travel of the closure element and the resultant small angle of<br>
rotation in the axis of rotation, a movement of the closure<br>
element that is to the greatest extent exclusively translatory<br>
can be ensured, which is likewise conducive to the reliable<br>
closing of the receiving opening, since contaminants that<br>
become attached to the closure or the adjacent bearing surfaces<br>
are not able to hinder the movement of the closure element, as<br>
they can for example in the case of a pivoting flap.<br>
In a development, the leaf spring may advantageously extend<br>
substantially in a plane parallel to the plane of the card. In<br>
this way, in the case of the leaf spring of an elongate<br>
configuration, the closure element moves in a manner that is<br>
substantially translatory and perpendicular to the plane of<br>
movement, so that an advantageous guillotine-like closure takes<br>
place. The decisive advantage lies in the saving of all the<br>
gear components, since the upstream leaf spring provides the<br>
arrangement with precisely the required degrees of freedom of<br>
movement. At the same time, the resilient mounting that is<br>
advantageous according to the invention is provided.<br>
The greatest stability is achieved if the closure element is<br>
formed integrally with the leaf spring. At the same time, the<br>
number of components is reduced, with the effect of lowering<br>
cost.  In this sense, further advantages are obtained if the<br><br>
PCT/EP2004/003137	- 6a<br>
2003P02903WOUS<br>
leaf  spring is part of a  further,  component-carrying,  if<br>
appropriate central, carrier.<br>
As already explained in respect of the leaf spring, it is *<br>
generally expedient that the closure element is resiliently<br>
mounted in a direction normal to the plane of movement within<br>
the travel required for the reception of the chip card. The<br>
advantages according to the invention arise from the<br>
combination of the resilient mounting in a direction normal to<br>
the plane of movement with a freedom of movement of the closure<br>
element that is oriented in a substantially translatory manner<br>
in a direction normal to the plane of movement. It should -be<br>
pointed out that rotational movements by small angles do not<br>
restrict the success according to the invention as long as the<br>
movement of the closure element is substantially a translatory<br>
movement oriented perpendicularly in relation to the plane of<br>
movement. The ratio of the travel required for the reception<br>
of the card to the distance of an axis of rotation of the<br>
movement of the closure element located in the inward direction<br>
of the closure element is of significance here. This axis of<br>
rotation is advantageously arranged away from the closure<br>
element in the inward direction by at least ten times the usual<br>
travel of the closure element. The same applies to the<br>
fastening of one end of the leaf spring in connection with the<br>
closure element.<br>
In order that the user can open the closure just by applying<br>
pressure by means of the card to be inserted, it is expedient<br>
if the closure element has on the input side a run-in slope for<br>
the card to be inserted that is located on the outside and<br>
extends in the longitudinal direction of the receiving opening.<br>
In the same way, it is expedient for the withdrawal of a card<br>
from the<br><br>
PCT/EP2004/003137	- 7 -<br>
2003P02903WOUS<br>
device according to the invention if the closure element has a<br>
run-in slope for the card to be pushed out that is located on<br>
the inside and extends in the longitudinal direction of the<br>
receiving opening.<br>
Since, in particular in the area of commercial vehicles, it<br>
cannot be assumed that the cards to be received will be handled<br>
with care, it is expedient if, in the closed position, the<br>
closure element bears in an elastically prestressed manner<br>
against a counter abutment, during the inward movement into, the<br>
card receiving device the card is arranged between the counter<br>
abutment and the closure element, is facing the closure element<br>
with a first flat side and is facing the counter abutment with<br>
a second flat side and the closure element is stressed against<br>
the flat side of the card facing the closure element. In this<br>
way, contaminants are stripped from the card by means of the<br>
closure element during the drawing-in movement. The stripping<br>
device may be provided both by the closure element and by the<br>
counter abutment. Since the closure element has preferred<br>
suitability for this stripping function, it is expedient if the<br>
card receiving device has a set of contacts for the contacting<br>
of the card that are arranged on the same side of the plane of<br>
movement as the closure element. In this way, the card is<br>
freed of contaminants particularly thoroughly on that flat side<br>
which comes into conducting connection with the contacts of the<br>
set of contacts in the end position. If the seal lying<br>
opposite the closure element is formed in a way making it<br>
suitable for stripping, it is in the same way advisable on<br>
account of the pressing force of the closure element for the<br>
same to be arranged on the side of the card opposite from the<br>
set of contacts.<br><br>
PCT/EP2004/003137	- 8 -<br>
2003P02903WOUS<br>
In order that in particular no splash water can penetrate into<br>
the device, it is advisable if, in the closed position, the<br>
closure element bears against a first seal extending in the<br>
longitudinal direction of the receiving opening. For further<br>
protection from splash water, it is additionally expedient to<br>
provide the receiving opening with a second seal in the<br>
transverse direction, against which the closure element bears<br>
in the closed position. Additional savings and a reduction in<br>
the number of components are obtained if the first seal,<br>
extending in the longitudinal direction of the receiving<br>
opening, forms with the second seal, extending in the<br>
transverse direction of the receiving opening, a component that<br>
can be used as strip material, if appropriate under elastic<br>
deformation, or already has a correspondingly shaped contour.<br>
For a pleasing external appearance, it is advisable to provide<br>
the device with a front panel, which has a rear side and a<br>
visible side and is provided in the region of the receiving<br>
opening of the card receiving device with a recess, which is at<br>
least partially surrounded on the rear side by a third seal,<br>
which seals with respect to the front side of the card<br>
receiving device in the region of the receiving opening, so<br>
that neither splash water nor dust can penetrate. This third<br>
seal expediently forms a component with the seal already<br>
sealing with respect to the closure element, so that the card<br>
receiving device has a front panel with a rear side, a visible<br>
side and with a recess in the region of the receiving opening<br>
the card, the cross section of the seal has a harder region,<br>
which extends in the longitudinal direction and against which<br>
the closure element bears in the closed position, and a softer<br>
region, which bears against the rear side of the panel.<br><br>
PCT/EP2004/003137	- 9 -<br>
2003P02903WOUS<br>
For the case in which water happens to get between the actual<br>
card receiving device and the front panel in spite of the seal,<br>
it is advisable if the panel has underneath the recess at least<br>
one drainage opening.<br>
It is expedient both for the automatic opening of the closure<br>
element on the basis of a pressure applied by means of the card<br>
to be received and also for a better sealing effect of the<br>
closure if the closure element has a cross section that tapers<br>
in the form of a wedge or runs to a point in relation to the<br>
seal, so that a substantially linear contact is obtained<br>
between the seal and the closure element in the closed<br>
position.<br>
To make allowance for relevant legal standards for tachographs,<br>
it is advisable if the card receiving device has a locking<br>
unit, which locks the closure in the closed position. In the<br>
case of resilient mounting of the closure element by means of a<br>
leaf spring, it is of particular advantage if the locking<br>
element of the locking unit blocks the leaf spring in the<br>
closed position. The advantages of the invention come fully to<br>
bear if the card can be automatically drawn into the card<br>
receiving device or withdrawn.<br>
The invention is explained in more detail below to illustrate<br>
it on the basis of a specific exemplary embodiment and with<br>
reference to drawings, in which:<br>

Figure 11 shows a longitudinal section through a closure<br>
according to the invention together with a front<br>
panel of a card receiving device;<br>
Figure 12 shows a detailed representation according to the<br>
detail Z indicated in Figure 11.<br>
In Figure 1, a closure element 7 according to the invention of<br>
a closure 6 is provided with the designation 7 and is<br>
represented together with an elastic element 8, formed as an<br>
extension arm 10, or a leaf spring 11 on a carrier 13. The<br>
carrier 13 and the leaf spring 11 are punched out from a metal<br>
sheet and the closure element 7 is molded as a plastic part<br>
onto the end of the leaf spring 11 on the input side. Likewise<br>
molded onto the carrier 13 are latching hooks 31 for the<br>
mounting of a sealing unit 32, represented in Figures 6 to 12.<br>
On account of the low amplitude, the movement of the closure<br>
element 7 of the closure 6 can be described by approximation as<br>
a rotation about a first axis of rotation 20, which is arranged<br>
in the region of the attachment of the leaf spring 11 and runs<br>
parallel to a plane of movement 4 of a card 2 .<br>
As also shown in Figures 2, 3, the closure element 7 has on the<br>
input side, in an inward direction 9, an outer run-in slope 14.<br>
By means of the outer run-in slope 14, the card is capable of<br>
pushing aside the closure element 7 from a receiving opening 5<br>
perpendicularly in relation to the plane of movement 4 of the<br>
card 2. On the inner side of the closure element 7 there is<br>
likewise an inner run-in slope 15, which makes it possible for<br>
the card 2 to push aside the clpsure element 7 as it leaves the<br>
device. The leaf spring 11, carrying the closure element 7, is<br>
offset approximately 6 mm in relation to the plane of the<br>
carrier 13 by being<br><br>
PCT/EP2004/003137	- 12 -<br>
2003P02903WOUS<br>
bent away in the direction of the plane of movement 4 of the<br>
card 2 and is therefore provided with a prestress that is<br>
obtained during operation When it bears against a counter<br>
abutment.<br>
In a way corresponding to the preferred use of tachographs, two<br>
closures according to the invention are usually arranged on a<br>
common carrier 13, as shown in Figure 3.<br>
In Figures 4, 5, a locking unit 29 is represented, provided<br>
with the designation 29.  In Figure 4, the locking unit 29 is<br>
in a non-locked position and, in Figure 5, the locking element<br>
is locked by means of the locking unit 29.  The locking unit 29 .<br>
has two locking elements 30, 35, which can in each case be<br>
pivoted about a third axis of rotation 33, 34.  The two locking<br>
elements 30, 35 are arranged laterally of the closure 6 on both<br>
sides of the plane of movement 4 for a card.   The locking<br>
elements 3 5, 30 are respectively provided on the end faces,<br>
facing the closure element -7, with a run-in slope 36, 37, which<br>
makes it possible for the locking elements 30,  3 5 to push<br>
themselves behind the closure element 7 in a plane between the<br>
plane of the closure element 7 and the plane of the carrier 13,<br>
so that the closure 6 can no longer spring back into an open<br>
position.<br>
In Figure 6, a sealing unit 32 is represented, which seal has<br>
cut-out recesses 38, 39, which correspond to the latching hooks<br>
31. The sealing unit 32, consisting of plastic, encloses the<br>
receiving opening 5 for the card in the plane of movement 4 in<br>
a U-shaped manner and is provided on the side facing the plane<br>
of movement 4 with a seal 40. The seal 40 integrally combines<br>
a first seal 21,<br><br>
PCT/EP2004/003137	- 13 -<br>
2003P02903WOUS<br>
extending in the longitudinal direction of the receiving<br>
opening 5, and two second seals 22, extending in the transverse<br>
direction of the receiving opening 5. The seal 40 is fitted in<br>
an interlocking manner in a corresponding receiving formation<br>
41. The cross section of the seal 40 that is represented in<br>
Figure 8 shows the arrangement with a first sealing lip 42 for<br>
sealing with respect to a front panel 25. As Figures 9, 10<br>
illustrate, the region of the second seal 22 has a chamber-like<br>
clearance with a second sealing lip 43, which is formed in a<br>
resilient manner and faces in the inward direction 9. t The<br>
second sealing lip 43 seals with respect to a laterally-<br>
protruding sealing surface 44 of the closure element, so that<br>
no splash water can penetrate laterally of the closure element<br>
7 either.<br>
As Figures 11, 12 illustrate in the detail of the partial<br>
representation of a card receiving device 1, if it is installed<br>
in accordance with regulations, the closure element 7 of the<br>
closure 6 closes with a movement from the bottom upward, that<br>
is to say substantially counter to the direction of<br>
gravitational force, and comes to bear against the first seal<br>
21 in the closed position. The installation position may also<br>
be inclined by up to 30° according to the invention. The<br>
resilient closure 7 thereby prevents the card from falling out<br>
when it is ejected, by means of clamping. On account of the<br>
wedge shape of the closure element 7, the bearing contact is<br>
substantially linear. On account of this arrangement, the seal<br>
40 describes a substantially inverted U shape around the<br>
receiving opening 5. In this way, splash water penetrating<br>
through a receiving recess 28 of the front panel 25 that<br>
corresponds to the receiving opening 5 can, under the driving<br>
effect of gravitational force, run into a drainage channel 46,<br>
located under the receiving opening 5 behind the front panel 2 5<br>
on the rear side 26, and from there<br><br>

leave the moisture-sensitive region from a drain 45. The<br>
portion that seals with respect to the front panel 2 5 is formed<br>
as a softer region 24 of the seal 40 and is softer than an<br>
adjacent, harder region 23, arranged as a counter abutment of<br>
the closure element. These two regions 23, 24 are integrally<br>
connected to each other.<br><br>
