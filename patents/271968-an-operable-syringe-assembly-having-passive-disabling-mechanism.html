				<td>SYRINGE ASSEMBLY HAVING DISABLING MECHANISM<br>
[0001]   This application claims priority from U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/638,089,<br>
filed December 21,2004.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
[0002] The present invention relates to syringe assemblies and particularly to syringe<br>
assemblies having an automatic disabling mechanism.<br>
[0003] Throughout the world the multiple use of hypodermic syringe products which are<br>
intended for single-use only, is instrumental in drug abuse and in the transfer of contagious<br>
diseases. Intravenous drug users who routinely share and re-use syringes are a high-risk<br>
group with respect to the AIDS virus. Also, the effects of multiple use are a major concern in<br>
some countries where repeated use of syringe products during mass immunization programs<br>
may be responsible for the spread of many diseases. Re-use of single-use hypodermic<br>
syringe assemblies is also instrumental in the spread of drug abuse even in the absence of<br>
infection or disease.<br>
[0004] Many attempts have been made to remedy this problem. Most notable are early<br>
contributions which relied on a specific act to destroy the syringe after use either by using a<br>
destructive device or providing a syringe assembly with frangible zones so that the syringe<br>
could be rendered inoperable by the application of force. Other attempts involve the<br>
inclusion of structure which would allow the destruction or defeating of the syringe function<br>
to a conscious act by the syringe user. Although many of these devices work quite well, they<br>
do require the specific intent of the user followed by the actual act to destroy or render the<br>
syringe inoperable. These devices are not effective with a user having the specific intent to<br>
re-use the hypodermic syringe. Accordingly, there was a need for a single-use hypodermic<br>
syringe which after use will become inoperable or incapable of further use automatically<br>
without any additional act on the part of the user. The automatic function is much harder to<br>
provide because the means for rendering the syringe inoperable must not prevent its filling or<br>
use under normal conditions.<br>
[0005] A single-use syringe which automatically disables after injection is' taught in U.S.<br>
Patent No. 4,973,310 to Kosinski. This syringe contains a locking element positioned in the<br>
syringe barrel between the plunger rod and the inside surface of the barrel.   In use, the<br>
2<br>
 <br>
syringe allows the user to draw a pre-selected amount of medication into the chamber of the<br>
barrel and deliver this medication, as through injection, into the patient. Any attempt to<br>
withdraw the plunger to use the syringe a second time will cause the locking element to<br>
embed itself into the inside surface of the syringe barrel to prevent proximal motion of the<br>
plunger rod.<br>
[0006] There is still a need for a single-use syringe which will allow a pre-selected number of<br>
plunger rod strokes before the automatic disabling mechanism activates. For example, four<br>
strokes of the plunger may be required to complete the injection process, such as when the<br>
syringe assembly is used to draw a diluent into the syringe barrel, dispense the diluent into a<br>
vial containing the substance to be reconstituted, drawing back the reconstituted medication<br>
into the syringe and then delivering the contents of the syringe into the patient.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
[0007] The present invention is directed to a syringe assembly having a passive disabling<br>
mechanism. The disabling mechanism enables variable dosages by the syringe assembly and<br>
enables a selected number of cycles or strokes by the plunger rod before being disabled. In<br>
one preferred embodiment, the disabling mechanism provides two aspirating and two<br>
dispensing cycles before being disabled. The assembly enables the aspiration and dispensing<br>
of a selected volume of a diluent into a vial to reconstitute a drug, pharmaceutical agent, or<br>
other substance and then aspirating the reconstituted substance back into the syringe. A<br>
selected volume of the reconstituted substance can be injected or delivered to a patient where<br>
the volume of the substance that is delivered can be the same or different than the volume of<br>
the substance aspirated into the syringe barrel. The syringe is automatically disabled after the<br>
injection or delivery stroke by retracting the plunger rod.<br>
[0008] The disabling mechanism is actuated by the axial movement of the plunger rod with<br>
respect to the syringe barrel and to the stopper, by moving the plunger rod in the aspirating<br>
direction. The stopper is coupled to the plunger rod through structure that allows limited<br>
axial movement of the stopper with respect to the plunger rod. The disabling mechanism is<br>
moved through a series of stages by reversing the direction of the axial movement of the<br>
plunger rod with respect to the stopper to move the mechanism in a step-wise manner to the<br>
disabling position. The disabling position of the mechanism is attained by the relative<br>
movement between the plunger rod and the stopper and is not dependent on the position of<br>
the stopper within the syringe barrel or the length of the stroke by the stopper. In this<br>
manner, the syringe assembly is able to dispense a desired volume of the drug or other<br>
3<br>
 <br>
substance, and the disabling mechanism can be actuated after the final dispensing or injection<br>
stroke regardless of the position of the stopper in the syringe barrel. By actuating the<br>
disabling mechanism, the stopper cannot be retracted to aspirate another dose into the syringe<br>
barrel but allows any substance remaining in the syringe barrel to be dispensed.<br>
[0009] The present syringe assembly provides an improvement over prior art devices by<br>
allowing a variable dose of diluent, chosen by the user at the time of use, to be drawn into the<br>
syringe, dispensing the diluent into a vial containing a substance to be reconstituted, drawing<br>
a selected amount of the reconstituted substance back into the syringe and then delivering the<br>
contents of the syringe. The selected amount of the reconstituted substance may be equal or<br>
less than the full volume reconstituted at the discretion of the user. The syringe assembly is<br>
automatically disabled after the final injection stroke by reversing the direction of the<br>
movement of the plunger rod from the dispensing direction to the aspirating direction. After<br>
the injection stroke of the syringe plunger, the plunger rod is retracted to activate the<br>
disabling mechanism to prevent axial movement of the stopper toward the proximal end of<br>
the syringe barrel thereby preventing the stopper from being removed and preventing reuse of<br>
the syringe to draw fluid into its chamber.<br>
[0010] When the present syringe assembly has two or more detents on the stopper and one or<br>
more detents in the plunger rod, the maximum number of strokes the syringe assembly will<br>
allow can be varied by the initial position of the locking element with respect to the stopper<br>
detents and the plunger rod detents.<br>
[0011] The present syringe assembly provides an improvement over prior art devices by<br>
providing a structure wherein the elements which allow the lost motion between the plunger<br>
rod and the stopper are contained internally within the plunger rod, safe from attempts to<br>
deflect the syringe barrel and plunger to defeat the locking mechanism. If these elements<br>
were on the outside of the plunger rod, it may be possible to deflect the barrel to contact the<br>
elements and defeat the locking mechanism.<br>
[0012] Another important advantage of the present invention is that in many embodiments,<br>
detents and discontinuities that function to achieve the desired result are annular, so that<br>
rotating the plunger rod with respect to the barrel will not distort, damage or defeat the<br>
locking element. A single use syringe will not be effective if it can be easily manipulated to<br>
overcome the locking mechanism for removing the components foT re-assembly and reuse.<br>
[0013] A further major advantage of the present invention is the single frangible zone in the<br>
stopper. In many designs there is no single point where a breaking feature may be added<br>
effectively and two or more components will have to be orchestrated to break under the same<br>
4<br>
 <br>
applied force to the plunger rod in an attempt to defeat the locking mechanism. In the present<br>
invention only one area needs to be weakened and it is centrally located safe from outside<br>
manipulation.<br>
|0014] An operable syringe assembly having a passive disabling structure includes a barrel<br>
having a side wall with an inside surface defining a chamber for retaining fluid, an open<br>
proximal end and a distal end including a distal wall having a passageway therethrough in<br>
fluid communication with the chamber. An elongate plunger rod includes a proximal end and<br>
an open distal end having an interior surface defining a cavity therein with at least one detent<br>
on the interior surface of the plunger rod. A secondary cavity is included at the proximal end<br>
of the cavity in the plunger rod. The secondary cavity has a distal end and a proximal end<br>
and includes a contact surface and at least one discontinuity in the cavity. A stopper includes<br>
a sealing element having a peripheral surface forming a seal with the inside surface of the<br>
barrel, and a post extending proximally from the sealing element having a proximal end and a<br>
distal end. There are at least two post detents on the post. A secondary post extends<br>
proximally axially from the proximal end of the post. The secondary post includes a<br>
proximal end and a distal end and at least one discontinuity on its surface. The secondary<br>
post is positioned at least partially in the secondary cavity of the plunger rod. Structure for<br>
limiting motion is provided to allow the stopper to move freely axially with respect to the<br>
plunger rod for a limited distance so that the plunger rod can move while the stopper remains<br>
stationary in the barrel and for transferring proximally and distally directed forces applied to<br>
the plunger rod to the stopper. In some embodiments the distance of this lost motion between<br>
the stopper and the plunger rod is determined by the secondary post contacting a contact<br>
surface in the secondary cavity of the barrel and the discontinuity on the secondary post<br>
contacting the secondary cavity discontinuity in the plunger rod. Any combination of<br>
discontinuities in the secondary cavity and/or on the secondary post that provide for a limited<br>
distance of lost motion is within the purview of the present invention. A locking element<br>
includes a central body portion having an aperture therethrough, at least one cantilevered leg<br>
extending distally outwardly from the body portion, and at least one finger element extending<br>
inwardly into the aperture. The cantilevered leg includes a sharp-free end directed outwardly<br>
for engaging the inside surface the barrel and the inside surface of the plunger rod. The<br>
locking element is initially positioned with the sharp-free end contacting the interior surface<br>
of the plunger rod proximally of the at least one detent in the plunger rod. The post is<br>
positioned in the aperture of the locking element wherein the finger element is contacting the<br>
proximal most of the at least two post detents, so that applying a proximally-directed force to<br>
5<br>
 <br>
the plunger rod while holding the barrel causes the plunger rod to move proximally with<br>
respect to the stopper until the free end of the cantilevered leg moves distally along the inner<br>
surface of the plunger rod cavity to the at least one detent in the cavity and the structure for<br>
limiting motion causes the stopper to move with the plunger rod in a proximal direction for a<br>
selected distance.   Subsequently applying a distally directed force to the plunger rod to<br>
discharge fluid from the chamber causes the plunger rod to move in a distal direction along<br>
with the locking element due to its engagement with the at least one detent in the cavity until<br>
the structure for limiting motion causes the stopper to move distally along with the plunger<br>
rod to discharge fluid from the chamber. Subsequently applying a proximally-directed force<br>
to the plunger rod will cause the plunger rod to move proximally with the free end of the<br>
cantilevered leg moving relatively distally along the inside surface of the plunger rod past the<br>
distal end of the plunger rod so that the cantilevered leg engages the inside surface of the<br>
barrel to help prevent proximal movement of the stopper for rendering the syringe assembly<br>
unusable.<br>
[0015]  Other embodiments may include a plunger rod with two axially-spaced detents, and a<br>
post with three axially-spaced post detents so that the plunger rod can be moved distally two<br>
times before proximal motion of the plunger rod causes the locking element to engage the<br>
inside surface of the barrel.<br>
[0016]  The two axially-spaced detents of the plunger rod may include two axially-spaced<br>
steps, each having a blunt surface at its distal end extending inwardly from the interior<br>
surface of the plunger rod.<br>
[0017]  Some or all of the three axially-spaced post detents may include an incline surface<br>
extending proximally inwardly and a blunt surface at the distal end of each of the inclined<br>
surfaces extending radially inwardly.<br>
[0018]  The syringe assembly may include a locking element having two cantilevered legs<br>
positioned on opposite sides of the central body portion.<br>
[0019]  The structure for limiting free axial motion of the stopper with respect to the plunger<br>
rod may include at least one motion limiting discontinuity on the secondary post positioned to<br>
engage at least one motion limiting discontinuity in the secondary cavity. The at least one<br>
motion limiting discontinuity on said secondary post may include an outwardly directing<br>
projection and the at least one motion limiting discontinuity in the plunger rod secondary<br>
cavity may include an inwardly directed projection.<br>
[0020]  The syringe assembly may include a radial projection or cam surface on the stopper<br>
positioned to contact and force the cantilevered leg outwardly when excessive proximal force<br>
6<br>
 <br>
is applied to the plunger rod in an attempt to overcome the locking element's engagement of<br>
the inside surface of the barrel.<br>
[0021] The syringe assembly may further include a frangible zone on the stopper which<br>
allows the plunger rod to disconnect from the stopper sealing element during application of<br>
excessive proximally-directed force to the plunger rod in an attempt to overcome the locking<br>
element's engagement of the inside surface of the barrel. The frangible zone may comprise<br>
an area of reduced cross-sectional area which is weaker than the post and the secondary post<br>
in areas outside of the zone. The frangible zone is positioned within the plunger rod. Only<br>
one frangible zone is necessary.<br>
[0022] The syringe assembly may have a discontinuity on the inside surface of the barrel side<br>
wall positioned to engage the sharp-free end of the locking element when the sharp-free end<br>
is in contact with the inside surface of the barrel.<br>
[0023] The syringe assembly may include a distal wall on the barrel having an elongate tip<br>
extending distally therefrom having a passageway in fluid communication with the<br>
passageway with the distal wall of the barrel. The syringe assembly may also further include<br>
a needle cannula having a distal end, a proximal end and a lumen therethrough. The proximal<br>
end of the needle cannula is connected to the distal end of the barrel so that the lumen is in<br>
fluid communication with the passageway.<br>
[0024] Another embodiment of an operable syringe assembly of the present invention having<br>
passive disabling structure includes a barrel comprising a side wall having an inside surface<br>
defining a chamber for retaining fluid, an open proximal end and a distal end including a<br>
distal wall having a passageway therethrough in fluid communication with the chamber. An<br>
elongate hollow plunger rod having a proximal end, an open distal end and an interior surface<br>
defining a cavity is provided. A stopper includes a sealing element with a peripheral surface<br>
forming a seal with the inside surface of the barrel and a post projecting proximally from the<br>
sealing element. A locking element includes a central body portion having at least one<br>
cantilevered leg extending distally outwardly from the body portion. The at least one leg<br>
includes a sharp free and directed outwardly for engaging the inside surface of the barrel.<br>
The locking element is movably engaged with the post and movably engaged with the<br>
plunger rod interior surface. Structure is provided for indexing the locking element distally<br>
in the plunger rod during proximal motion of the plunger rod to draw fluid into the chamber<br>
and for indexing the locking element distally on the post of the stopper during distally<br>
directed motion of the plunger rod for delivering fluid from the chamber through the<br>
passageway. Structure is also provided for limiting axial free movement of the stopper with<br>
7<br>
 <br>
respect to the plunger rod to allow the indexing of the locking element and for applying<br>
proximally and distally directed forces to the stopper through the plunger rod.<br>
[002S|  The locking element may be made of sheet metal such as stainless steel and the<br>
stopper may be integrally formed of thermoplastic material.<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
[0047] Referring to Figs. 1-18, a syringe assembly 20 having passive disabling features<br>
includes a barrel 21 and a plunger assembly 22. Barrel 21 includes a cylindrical side wall 23<br>
having an inside surface 24 defining a chamber 25 for retaining fluid. The barrel further<br>
includes an open proximal end 27 and a distal end 28 including a distal wall 29 having a<br>
passageway 32 therethrough in fluid communication with the chamber. In this embodiment,<br>
the distal wall of the barrel includes an elongate tip 31 extending distally therefrom and<br>
having a passageway therethrough in fluid communication with the passageway in the distal<br>
wall. In this embodiment, barrel 21 also includes a needle cannula 37 having a proximal end<br>
38, a distal end 39 and a lumen 40 therethrough. The proximal end of the needle cannula is<br>
attached to elongate tip 31 so that the lumen of the needle cannula is in fluid communication<br>
with passageway 32 in the barrel. A needle hub may also be attached to the proximal end of<br>
the needle cannula. In this configuration the needle hub engages the elongate tip to establish<br>
fluid communication between the lumen and the passageway in the barrel.<br>
[0048] Plunger assembly 22 includes an elongate plunger rod 43, a stopper 81 and a locking<br>
element 71. Plunger rod 43 includes a proximal end 44, an open distal end 45 and interior<br>
surface 46 defining a cavity 47 therein. The interior surface of the plunger rod preferably<br>
includes at least one detent. In this embodiment the at least one detent on the interior surface<br>
of the plunger rod includes two annular axially spaced detents 49 on the interior surface of<br>
the cavity. Each detent comprises a step 50 having a blunt suface 51 at its distal end. As will<br>
9<br>
 <br>
be explained in more detail hereinafter, the present invention can function without detents on<br>
the interior surface of the plunger rod. The plunger rod also includes a secondary cavity 52 at<br>
a proximal end of cavity 47. The secondary cavity preferably includes a distal end 53 having<br>
a distal contact surface 61, a proximal end 54 having a proximal contact surface 55, and at<br>
least one discontinuity therein. In this embodiment the discontinuity comprises one or more<br>
inwardly directed projections 56. The secondary cavity is preferably smaller than cavity 47.<br>
The primary purpose of the secondary cavity is to interact with the stopper so that the stopper<br>
is free to move axially with respect to the plunger rod for a limited distance. As will be seen<br>
hereinafter, this lost motion which allows the plunger rod to move independently of the<br>
stopper allows the locking element to index through a sequence of positions which end in the<br>
locking of the stopper in the barrel to prevent further use.<br>
[0049| Stopper 81 includes a preferably circularly-shaped sealing element 82 having a<br>
peripheral surface 83 forming a seal with the inside surface of the barrel. A post 85 extends<br>
proximally from the sealing element and has a proximal end 87, a distal end 88 and<br>
preferably at least two detents on its surface. In this embodiment, the at least two post<br>
detents includes three axially-spaced post detents 89. Each post detent preferably but not<br>
necessarily, includes an inclined surface 91 and a blunt surface 92 at the distal end of each<br>
inclined surface. As will be explained in more detail hereinafter it is within the purview of<br>
the present invention to include an embodiment having a post without detents. A secondary<br>
post 93 extends proximally axially from the proximal end of post 85. The secondary post<br>
includes a proximal end 94, a distal end 95 and at least one discontinuity on its surface. In<br>
this embodiment discontinuity 96 is a radial projection having a distally-facing surface 97<br>
thereon. The secondary post is positioned at least partially in the secondary cavity of the<br>
plunger rod. As mentioned hereinabove, the plunger rod is free to move axially with respect<br>
to the stopper for a limited distance which, in this embodiment, is controlled in one direction<br>
by the proximal end of the secondary post contacting proximal contact surface 55 in the<br>
secondary cavity and/or the proximal most detent 89 and distal contact surface 61 of the<br>
secondary cavity, and in the other direction by the secondary post discontinuity contacting the<br>
secondary cavity discontinuity in the plunger rod.<br>
[0050] Locking element 71 includes a central body portion 72 having an aperture 73<br>
therethrough. Preferably, at least one cantilevered leg extends distally outwardly from the<br>
body portion, hi this embodiment, there are two cantilevered legs 74 extending distally<br>
outwardly from opposite sides of body portion 72. A plurality of cantilevered legs or other<br>
spring and/or resilient structures for engaging the interim surface of the plunger rod and the<br>
10<br>
 <br>
inside surface of the barrel are within the purview of the present invention. At least one<br>
finger element 75 extends inwardly into said aperture. In this embodiment the finger element<br>
extends proximally inwardly from the aperture. Each of the cantilevered legs preferably<br>
includes a sharp-free end 76 directed outwardly from engaging the inside surface of the<br>
barrel. The sharp-free end of the cantilevered leg can be formed in any configuration capable<br>
of engaging the inside surface of the barrel, such as a sharp edge or one or more pointed teeth<br>
and the like. The locking element may be made of a variety of materials, or combinations of<br>
materials, however, it is preferred to have a sharp-free end made of metal, and it is also<br>
preferred that the entire locking element be integrally formed from sheet metal such as<br>
stainless steel.<br>
[005l] In this embodiment, plunger assembly 22 may be assembled by inserting locking<br>
element 71 into the distal end of plunger rod 43. The post of stopper 81 is then inserted into<br>
the distal end of the plunger rod through aperture 73 of locking element 71 so that<br>
cantilevered legs 74 extend towards circularly-shaped sealing element 82 of the stopper as<br>
illustrated in Fig. 9. The plunger assembly is then inserted into barrel 21 through open<br>
proximal end 27 to the initial position illustrated in Figs. 3 and 10. Also, the syringe<br>
assembly may be assembled by inserting locking element 71 into the distal end of the plunger<br>
rod and inserting stopper 81 into the open proximal end of barrel 21, and then inserting the<br>
locking element/plunger rod into the proximal end of the syringe barrel.<br>
[0052] In the initial position of the syringe assembly, locking element 71 is positioned with<br>
its sharp-free end 76 contacting the interior surface of the plunger rod proximally of axially-<br>
spaced steps 50. Post 85 on stopper 81 is positioned in aperture 73 of locking element 71 so<br>
that finger, element 75 contacts the post proximally of two of the three axially-spaced post<br>
detents 89. The proximal end of the secondary post 93 is near or contacting contact surface<br>
55 in proximal end 52 of the secondary cavity in the plunger rod, and the inclined surface of<br>
the most proximal post detent 89 is near or contacting contact surface 61 at the distal end of<br>
the secondary cavity. Contact between the proximal end of the secondary post and contact<br>
surface 55 in the secondary cavity and/or contact between the proximal most post detent, and<br>
contact surface 61 defines the proximal most motion of the stopper with respect to the<br>
plunger rod. Both contacts are preferred for stronger resistance to excessive distally directed<br>
force on the plunger rod. Stopper 81 further includes stabilizing member 84 positioned<br>
proximally with respect to sealing element 82 and having an outer dimension complementing<br>
the outer dimension of the sealing element as illustrated in Fig. 10. Stabilizing member 84<br>
has an outer dimension which is preferably less than the sealing element to assist in<br>
 <br>
11<br>
 <br>
<br>
 <br>
stabilizing the stopper to maintain the seal between the peripheral surface of the sealing<br>
element and the side surface of the barrel, and to maintain the stopper and post alignment<br>
substantially parallel to the axis of the syringe barrel.<br>
[0053] As will be shown, the operation of the plunger assembly of this embodiment includes<br>
a first aspiration stroke followed by a first dispensing or injection stroke, a second aspirating<br>
stroke and a final dispensing or injection stroke after which the syringe will become disabled<br>
if another aspiration stroke is attempted. The disabling elements prevent or inhibit movement<br>
of the stopper in a proximal aspirating direction thereby limiting the function of the syringe<br>
assembly to a single use. The number of strokes in this embodiment is controlled by the<br>
number of axially-spaced detents in the plunger rod and the number of axially-spaced post<br>
detents on the stopper. However, the actual strokes the syringe may make will be determined<br>
by the position of the locking element with respect to the detents in the plunger rod and the<br>
detents on the stopper at the time of first use. For example, a syringe with two detents in the<br>
plunger rod and three stopper post detents on the stopper can be supplied to the user as a<br>
syringe capable of two strokes or four strokes. This is an important feature of the invention<br>
since a single syringe assembly can be provided with different stroke limitations before<br>
disabling.<br>
[0054] Referring to Fig. 11, the syringe assembly may now be used to draw liquid, such as<br>
sterile water diluent into the chamber of the barrel by applying a proximally directed force F<br>
to a thumb press 57 on the proximal end of the plunger rod while holding the syringe barrel.<br>
This causes the plunger rod to move proximally with respect to the stopper until distally-<br>
facing surface 97 on discontinuity 96 of the secondary post contacts inwardly-directed<br>
projections 56 on the plunger rod. At the same time, the free ends of cantilevered legs 74<br>
move distally along an interior surface 46 of the plunger rod and snap past blunt surface 51 of<br>
the proximal-most axially-spaced steps 50. The stopper can now be moved proximally,<br>
through action of the plunger rod, until the desired volume is in the chamber, as determined<br>
by the user. It is an important feature of this invention that the user determines the volume,<br>
rather than the structure of the disabling mechanism dictating the volume as in some prior art<br>
devices.<br>
[0055] Liquid diluent 33 in the chamber may now be dispensed into a vial of dry medication<br>
such as lyophilized medication, for reconstitution. As illustrated in Fig. 12, the first<br>
dispensing stroke is accomplished by applying force F to the plunger rod, in a distal direction,<br>
while holding the barrel. A barrel flange 30 is provided on the proximal end of the barrel to<br>
help control motion of the barrel during use of the syringe assembly.   As the plunger rod<br>
12<br>
 <br>
moves distally, locking element 71 moves with the plunger rod dragging the locking element<br>
with it so that finger element 75 on the locking element slides from the proximal-most to the<br>
next proximal-most detent by riding up inclined surface 91 and falling into second of three<br>
post detents 89. When the plunger rod contacts the stopper by action of the proximal end of<br>
the secondary post and contact surface 55 in the plunger rod and/or the proximal most post<br>
detent and contact surface 61, the stopper will begin moving in a distal direction along with<br>
the plunger rod to dispense liquid diluent from the chamber into, for example, a vial of<br>
lyophilized medication.<br>
[0056] When the diluent and the lyophilized medication are mixed, the syringe assembly of<br>
the present invention may now be used to withdraw the reconstituted, ready-to-inject<br>
medication into the chamber of the syringe barrel, as best illustrated in Figs. 13 and 14. By<br>
applying a proximally-directed force F to the plunger rod while holding the syringe barrel,<br>
the plunger rod will move in a proximal direction while locking element 71 will remain<br>
relatively stationary due to its connection to the post detent on the stopper. Proximal motion<br>
of the plunger rod causes the locking element to move relatively distally along the inside<br>
surface of the plunger rod so that the sharp-free ends 76 of the cantilevered legs move from<br>
the proximal-most axially-spaced step 50 in the plunger rod to the second more-distal axially-<br>
spaced step 50. Proximal motion of the plunger rod also causes distally-facing surface 97 on<br>
discontinuity 96 of the secondary post to contact inwardly-directed projections 56 in the<br>
secondary cavity so that the stopper now moves proximally with the plunger rod drawing<br>
reconstituted medication 34 into chamber 25 of the syringe barrel to an amount determined<br>
by the user. The amount of medication drawn into the chamber, and therefore the maximum<br>
amount of medication that can be delivered, is determined by the user at the time of use and<br>
not by the placement of the components at the time of manufacture.<br>
[0057] The syringe assembly of the present invention is now ready for a second and final<br>
dispensing or injection stroke which is best illustrated in Figs. 15 and 16. Medication 34 is<br>
delivered to the patient by applying a distally-directed force F to the plunger rod causing the<br>
plunger rod to move in a distal direction with respect to the barrel. As the plunger rod<br>
advances in a distal direction engagement of sharp-free ends 76 of the locking element with<br>
the most distal blunt surface 50 of axially-spaced steps 50 moves the locking element distally<br>
so that finger element 75 of the locking element rides over the distal-most inclined surface 91<br>
of the post detents distally to the most distal post detent 89. When the distally-moving<br>
plunger rod contacts the stopper, both the stopper and plunger rod move toward the distal end<br>
of the barrel to dispense the contents of the chamber through the passageway.<br>
13<br>
 <br>
[0058] The syringe assembly has now been used and is ready to be discarded. Any attempt<br>
to move the plunger rod in a proximal direction with respect to the barrel to refill the syringe<br>
assembly for further use will cause the locking element to disable the syringe. Specifically,<br>
as best illustrated in Figs. 17 and 18, applying force F to the plunger rod in a proximal<br>
direction will allow the plunger rod to move a short distance until the sharp-free ends 76 of<br>
the locking element snap past the distal end of the plunger rod and engage inside surface 24<br>
of barrel 21. In addition, a radial projection in the form of cam surface 58 on the stopper is<br>
positioned to force sharp-free ends 76 of the locking element further into the syringe barrel<br>
wall as more proximally-directed force is used in an attempt to improperly reuse the syringe.<br>
The cam surface may be annular or there may be one or more individual cam surfaces<br>
positioned to contact the locking element cantilevered legs. Cam surface 58 also includes a<br>
stop 59 to limit the distance the stopper moves in a proximal direction which helps prevent<br>
the reuse of the syringe. It is desirable to limit the proximal motion of the stopper to a<br>
distance that will only allow the syringe to take in a volume of less than 10% of the<br>
medication dose. Accordingly, increased force to pull the plunger rod out of the syringe<br>
barrel results in increased force of engagement of the sharp-free ends of the locking element<br>
into the barrel.<br>
[0059] It is also within the purview of the present invention to provide a discontinuity, such<br>
as a recess or projection, on the interior surface of the barrel, as illustrated in Fig. 19 to<br>
further improve the engagement of the sharp-free end of the locking element with the interior<br>
surface of the barrel. In Fig. 19, syringe barrel 21 includes a barrel discontinuity in the form<br>
of an inwardly-directed projection 35 on inside surface 24 of the barrel. In this embodiment,<br>
projection 35 is an annular ring projecting into the barrel and extending 360° around the<br>
inside surface. The discontinuity may be in the form of an annular projection, an annular<br>
recess or one or more projections or recesses shaped to engage sharp-free ends 76 of locking<br>
element 71 to further increase the grip of the locking element on the inside surface of the<br>
barrel.<br>
[0060] The syringe assembly of the present invention also includes a frangible zone on<br>
stopper 81 positioned distally from discontinuity 96 on secondary post 93 for allowing the<br>
plunger rod to disconnect from the stopper sealing element during the application of<br>
excessive, proximally-directed force to the plunger rod in an attempt to overcome the locking<br>
element's engagement of the inside surface of the barrel. As illustrated in Figs. 19 and 20,<br>
the frangible zone in this embodiment preferably comprises a zone of reduced cross-sectional<br>
area 98 which is weaker in tension than the post 85 and secondary post 93 in areas outside of<br>
 <br>
14<br>
 <br>
<br>
 <br>
the zone. It should be noted that the frangible zone can be achieved in many ways such as<br>
forming portions of the stopper separately and assembling them using adhesive or mechanical<br>
connector in the area of the frangible zone, altering the area of the zone to be weaker than<br>
surrounding material, forming the stopper of different materials using the weakest material to<br>
form the zone and the like. The zone of reduced cross-sectional area illustrated herein is<br>
merely representative of these many possibilities all of which are in the purview of the<br>
present invention. The frangible zone is an important feature of the present invention since<br>
the weakest area of the syringe assembly can be located in one position and carefully<br>
controlled for the force of breaking or disconnecting, without needing to compromise other<br>
elements of the syringe assembly by having to create multiple frangible zones. The frangible<br>
zone is also preferably located within the plunger rod where it is difficult to access from<br>
outside of the syringe barrel for the purpose of defeating the single-use structure of the<br>
syringe assembly.<br>
[0061] Referring to Fig. 21, an alternative embodiment of the syringe assembly of the present<br>
invention is illustrated. This embodiment functions similarly to the embodiment of Figs. 1-<br>
18 with the exception that there are no detents on the stopper post or in the plunger rod<br>
cavity. As described above, embodiments of Figs. 1-18 include a barrel having a relatively<br>
smooth inside surface to which the sharp-free ends of the cantilevered legs of the locking<br>
element engage. In the embodiments shown in Figs. 19 and 20 the barrel includes an<br>
inwardly-directed projection. The purpose of this projection is to improve the grip of the free<br>
ends of the cantilevered legs on the inside surface of the barrel to more strongly resist the<br>
application of a proximally-directed force on the plunger to defeat the locking mechanism<br>
after the syringe has been used. If the sharp-free ends of the cantilevered legs are sharp<br>
enough and angled properly they should be able to resist such force without addition of an<br>
inwardly-directed projection on the inside surface of the barrel. likewise, the detents on the<br>
stopper post and the interior surface of the plunger rod in the embodiment of Figs. 1-18, are<br>
provided to assure that locking element will index properly with each stroke of the plunger<br>
with respect to the barrel placing the locking element in position to disable the syringe at the<br>
completion of the last delivery stroke. Detents also allow more latitude in the design of the<br>
plunger rod, stopper and locking element such as being able to use a broader range of<br>
materials, and to use looser, more cost-effective tolerances. However, the invention will<br>
function without detents on the stopper post and in the plunger rod if an adequately sharp and<br>
resilient element is used with compliant materials. Specifically, as shown in Fig. 21, syringe<br>
assembly 120 includes a barrel 121 having a cylindrical side wall 123 and an inside surface<br>
 <br>
15<br>
 <br>
<br>
 <br>
124 defining a chamber 125 for retaining fluid. An elongate plunger rod 143 includes an<br>
open distal end 145 having an interior surface 146 defining a cavity 147 therein. A stopper<br>
181 includes a sealing element 182 having a peripheral surface forming a seal with the inside<br>
surface of the barrel. A post 185 extends proximally from the sealing element having a<br>
proximal end 187 and a distal end 188. Locking element 171 includes a central body portion<br>
172 having an aperture therethrough. Cantilevered legs 174 bend distally-outwardly from<br>
opposite sides of body portion 172. At least one finger element 175 bends proximally-<br>
inwardly from the aperture. Each of the cantilevered legs has a sharp free end 176 directed<br>
outwardly for engaging inside surface 124 of the barrel and interior surface 146 of the<br>
plunger rod. The sharp free end of each cantilevered leg is configured to move relatively<br>
freely in a distal direction and to resist proximally-directed motion by engaging the surface<br>
which is contacts. Likewise, finger element 175 is configured to move distally along the post<br>
of the stopper but to resist proximal motion along the post by engaging the stopper post. In<br>
all other aspects this embodiment functions similarly to the embodiment of Figs. 1-18.<br>
[0062] While various embodiments have been chosen to illustrate the invention, it will be<br>
appreciated that changes and modifications can be made without departing from the scope of<br>
the invention.<br>

locking element including at least one finger element extending inwardly from an aperture in<br>
said central body portion, said locking element being positioned with said sharp-free end<br>
contacting said interior surface of said plunger rod proximally of said at least one detent, said<br>
post being positioned in said aperture of said locking element wherein said at least one finger<br>
element is contacting the proximal most of said at least two post detents and said secondary<br>
post being positioned in said secondary cavity so that said secondary post detent is proximal<br>
with respect to said secondary cavity detent and capable of engaging said secondary cavity<br>
discontinuity.<br>
20.	The syringe assembly of claim 19 wherein said at least one detent in said plunger rod<br>
includes two axially spaced detents and said at least two detents on said post includes three<br>
axially spaced post detents so that said plunger rod can be moved distally two times before<br>
proximal motion of said plunger rod causes said locking element to engage said inside<br>
surface of said barrel.<br>
21.	The syringe assembly of claim 20 wherein said two axially spaced detents in said<br>
plunger rod include two axially spaced steps each having a blunt surface at its distal end<br>
extending inwardly from said interior surface.<br>
22.	The syringe assembly of claim 19 wherein said three axially spaced post detents each<br>
include a blunt distally facing surface at a distal end of each of said detents.<br>
22<br>
 <br>
 <br>
23<br>
23.	The syringe assembly of claim 19 said at least one cantilevered leg of said locking<br>
element includes two cantilevered legs positioned on opposite sides of said central body<br>
portion and said at least one detent in said interior surface of said distal end of said plunger<br>
rod includes two detents positioned on opposite side of said plunger rod.<br>
24.	The syringe assembly of claim 22 further including two radial cam projections on said<br>
stopper positioned to contact and force said two cantilevered legs outwardly when excessive<br>
proximally directed force is applied to said plunger rod in an attempt to overcome said<br>
locking element's engagement to said inside surface of said barrel.<br>
25.	The syringe assembly of claim 18 having a discontinuity on said inside surface of said<br>
barrel side wall positioned to engage said sharp free end of said locking element when said<br>
sharp free end is contacting said inside surface of said barrel.<br>
26.	The syringe assembly of claim 18 wherein said distal wall of said barrel further<br>
includes an elongate tip extending distally therefrom having a passageway in fluid<br>
communication with said passageway in said distal wall.<br>
27.	The syringe assembly of claim 18 further including a needle cannula having a distal<br>
end, a proximal end and a lumen therethrough, said proximal end of said needle cannula<br>
being connected to said distal end of said barrel so that said lumen is in fluid communication<br>
with said passageway.<br>
28.	The syringe assembly of claim 18 wherein said locking element is made of sheet<br>
metal.<br>
29.	The syringe assembly of claim 18 wherein said stopper is integrally formed of<br>
thermoplastic material.<br>
<br>
A syringe assembly having passive disabling structure includes a barrel (21) and a<br>
plunger rod assembly (43). The plunger rod assembly includes a plunger rod and a<br>
stopper (81) connected by an indexing locking element (71). The number of strokes of<br>
the syringe plunger before the stopper is locked into the barrel rendering the syringe<br>
assembly unusable is determined by the number of detents (89) on the plunger rod and<br>
stopper which engage the locking mechanism. Upon completion of the final delivery<br>
stroke, any attempt to withdraw the plunger rod from the barrel will cause the locking<br>
element to engage the barrel and trap the stopper in the preventing further use of the<br>
syringe.<br>
