The present invention relates to certain novel naphthopyran compounds.  More particularly, this invention relates to novel photochromic indeno-fused naphthopyran compounds and to compositions and articles containing such novel naphthopyran compounds.  When exposed to light radiation containing ultraviolet rays, such as the ultraviolet, radiation in sunlight or the light of a mercury lamp, many photochromic compounds exhibit a reversible change in color,  when the ultraviolet radiation is discontinued, such a photochromic compound will return to its original color or colorless state. Various classes of photochromic compounds have been synthesized and suggested for use in applications in which a sunlight-induced reversible color change or darkening is desired.  U.S. Patent 3,567,605 (Becker) describes a series of pyran derivatives, including certain benzopyrans and naphthopyrans.  These compounds are described as derivatives of chromene and are reported to undergo a color change, e.g., from colorless to yellow-orange, on irradiation by ultraviolet light at temperatures below about -30°C.  Irradiation of the compounds with visible light or upon raising the temperature to above about 0°C is reported to reverse the coloration to a colorless state.<br>
U.S. Patent 5,066,818 describes various 3,3-diaryl-3H-naphtho[2,1-b]pyrans as having desirable photochromic properties, i.e., high colorability and acceptable fade, for ophthalmic and other applications.  Also disclosed by way of comparative example in the '818 patent are the isomeric 2,2-diaryl-2H-naphtho[1, 2-b]pyrans , which are reported to require unacceptably long periods of time to fade after activation.<br><br>
-2-<br>
U.S. Patent 3,627,690 describes photochromic 2, 2-di-substituted-2H-naphtho[1, 2-b]pyran compositions containing minor amounts of either a base or weak-to-moderate strength acid.  The addition of either an acid or base to the naphthopyran composition is reported to increase the fade rate of the colored naphthopyrans, thereby making them useful in eye protection applications such as sunglasses.  It is reported therein further that the fade rate of 2H-naphtho-[1, 2-b]pyrans without the aforementioned additives ranges from several hours to many days to reach complete reversion.  U.S. Patent 4,818,096 discloses purple/blue coloring photochromic benzo- or naphthopyrans having at the position alpha to the oxygen of the pyran ring a phenyl group having a nitrogen containing substituent in the ortho or para positions.<br>
The present invention relates to novel substituted naphthopyran compounds having a substituted or unsubstituted indeno group, the 2,1 positions of which are fused to the f side of the naphtho portion of the naphthopyran, and certain substituents at the 3-position of the pyran ring.  These compounds have unexpectedly been found to demonstrate a bathochromic shift for the wavelength in the visible spectrum at which the maximum absorption of the activated (colored) form of the photochromic compound, i.e., the lambda max (Vis), occurs, thereby resulting in activated colors ranging from orange to blue/gray.  In addition, these compounds have demonstrated a high molar absorptivity (or molar extinction coefficient) in the UV, an acceptable fade rate without the addition of acids or bases, a high activated intensity, and a high coloration rate.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION In recent years, photochromic plastic materials, particularly plastic materials for optical applications, have been the subject of considerable attention.  In particular, photochromic ophthalmic plastic lenses have been investigated because of the weight advantage they offer, vis-a-vis, glass<br><br>

Compounds represented by graphic formula I having the substituents R3, R4, B, and B', described hereinbefore, may be prepared by the following Reactions A through E. Methods for the preparation of compounds represented by graphic formula I including the substituents R1  and R2, described hereinbefore, are included in Reactions D and E. Compounds represented by  graphic formula V, VA, or VB are either purchased or prepared by Friedel-Crafts methods shown in Reaction A using an appropriately substituted or unsubstituted benzoyl chloride of graphic formula IV with a commercially available substituted or unsubstituted benzene compound of graphic formula III.  See the publication Friedel-Crafts and  Related Reactions, George A. Olah, Interscience Publishers, 1964, Vol. 3, Chapter XXXI (Aromatic Ketone Synthesis), and "Regioselective Friedel-Crafts Acylation of 1,2,3,4-Tetrahydroquinoline and Related Nitrogen Heterocycles: Effect on NH Protective Groups and Ring Size" by Ishihara, Yugi et al, J. Chem. Soc, Perkin Trans. 1, pages 3401 to 3406, 1992.<br><br>

In Reaction A, the compounds represented by graphic formulae III and IV are dissolved in a solvent, such as carbon disulfide or methylene chloride, and reacted in the presence of a Lewis acid, such as aluminum chloride or tin tetrachloride, to form the corresponding substituted benzophenone represented by graphic formula V (VA in Reaction B or VB in Reaction C).  R and R' represent possible substituents, as described hereinbefore with respect to graphic formula I.<br>
Reaction A<br><br>
In Reaction B, the substituted or unsubstituted ketone represented by graphic formula VA, in which B and B' may represent groups other than substituted or unsubstituted phenyl, as shown in graphic formula V, is reacted with sodium acetylide in a suitable solvent, such as anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (THF), to form the corresponding propargyl alcohol represented by graphic formula VI.  Propargyl alcohols having B or B' groups other than substituted and unsubstituted phenyl may be prepared from commercially available ketones or ketones prepared via reaction of an acyl halide with a substituted or unsubstituted benzene, naphthalene or heteroaromatic compound.  Propargyl alcohols having a B or B group represented by graphic formula IIC may be prepared by the methods described in U.S. Patent 5,274,132, column 2, lines 40 to 68.<br><br>
-10-Reaction B<br><br>
In Reaction C, a substituted or unsubstituted benzophenone represented by graphic formula VB is reacted with an ester of succinic acid such as dimethyl succinate represented by graphic formula VII.  Addition of the reactants to a solvent, e.g., toluene, containing potassium t-butoxide or sodium hydride as the base yields the Stobbe condensation half ester represented by graphic formula VIII.  If R3 and R4 on the benzophenone are not identical, i.e., not structurally symmetrical, a mixture of cis and trans half esters will be formed that will require further purification to isolate a distinct isomer.  The half ester (VIII) undergoes cyclodehydration in the presence of acetic anhydride to form the acetoxynaphthalene represented by graphic formula IX. This product is hydrolyzed in an aqueous alcoholic solution of base, such as sodium hydroxide, followed by treatment with aqueous hydrochloric acid (H+) to form the carboxynaphthol represented by graphic formula X.<br><br>
-11-Reaction C<br><br>
In Reaction D, the carboxynaphthol represented by graphic formula X is cyclized by heating, e.g., from about 160 to about 220°C. , in the presence of an acid, such as phosphoric acid, to a hydroxy-substituted benz-fused fluorenone represented by graphic formula XI.  See the article by F.G. Baddar et al, in the J. Chem. Soc, page 986, 1958. An alternate method of synthesizing the compound represented by graphic formula XI is described by C.F. Koelsch in the Journal of Organic Chemistry, volume 26, page 2.590, 1961.<br>
Coupling of the compound represented by graphic formula XI with a propargyl alcohol represented by graphic formula VI in the presence of a catalytic amount of an acid, e.g., dodecylbenzene sulfonic acid (DBSA), results in the indeno-fused naphthopyran represented by graphic formula IA. The reduction of the compound represented by graphic formula XI via the Wolff-Kishner reduction results in the compound represented by graphic formula XIA.  Coupling of the compound represented by graphic formula XIA with a propargyl alcohol<br><br>
-12-<br>
represented by graphic formula VI results in the indeno-fused naphthopyran represented by graphic formula IB.  The replacement of the hydrogens in graphic formula IB by alkyl groups, e.g., R1  and R2, is accomplished by reaction of the compound IB with trialkyl aluminum to produce the compound represented by graphic formula IC.<br>
Compounds similar to the compounds represented by graphic formula IC in which R1  and R2 are alkoxy instead of alkyl or R1  and R2 are taken together to form a spiro-heterocyclic group containing 2 oxygen atoms and 3 to 6 carbon atoms including the spirocarbon atom may be prepared by reacting the compound represented by graphic formula IA with an alcohol or a diol, respectively, in the presence of a catalytic amount of acid.<br><br>

-14-<br>
In Reaction E, further methods for preparing compounds represented by graphic formula I having different R1 and R2 substituents are described.  Starting with the compound represented by graphic formula IA, reduction with lithium aluminum hydroxide (LAH) results in the compound represented by graphic formula ID.  Other methods for reducing the carbonyl group are described in the text The Chemistry of the Carbonyl Group, Chapter 11, Saul Patai, Editor, 1966, Interscience Publishers.<br>
The reaction of the compound represented by graphic formula ID with an acyl chloride having the potential substituent R' results in the compound represented by graphic formula IE.  Another pathway for incorporating different R1  and R2 substituents on the compound represented by graphic formula IA is by reacting the compound (IA) with a Grignard or lithium reagent having the potential substituent R to produce the compound represented by graphic formula IF.  Subsequent reaction of the compound represented by graphic formula IF with an alcohol having the potential substituent R' in the presence of an acid such as hydrochloric acid results in the compound represented by graphic formula IG.<br><br>
-15-Reaction E<br><br>
Compounds represented by graphic formula I may be used in those applications in which organic photochromic substances may be employed, such as optical lenses, e.g., vision correcting ophthalmic lenses and piano lenses, face shields, goggles, visors, camera lenses, windows, automotive windshields, aircraft and automotive transparencies, e.g.,<br><br>

T-roofs, sidelights and backlights, plastic films and sheets, textiles and coatings, e.g., coating compositions such as paints, and verification marks on security documents, e.g., documents such as banknotes, passports and drivers' licenses for which authentication or verification of authenticity may be desired.  Naphthopyrans represented by graphic formula I exhibit color changes from colorless to colors ranging from orange to blue/gray.<br>

(i)  3,3-di(4-methoxyphenyl)-6,11-dimethyl-13-butyl-13-hydroxy-indeno[2,1-f] naphtho[1,2-b]pyran.<br>
It is contemplated that the organic photochromic naphthopyrans of the present invention may be used alone, in combination with other naphthopyrans of the present invention, or in combination with one or more other appropriate complementary organic photochromic materials, i.e., organic photochromic compounds having at least one activated absorption maxima within the range of between about 400 and<br><br>
-17-<br>
700 nanometers, or substances containing same, and may be incorporated, e.g., dissolved or dispersed, in a polymeric organic host material used to prepare photochromic articles and which color when activated to an appropriate hue.<br>
Other than in the operating examples, or where otherwise indicated, all numbers expressing wavelengths, quantities of ingredients or reaction conditions used herein are to be understood as modified in all instances by the term "about".<br>
Examples of complementary organic photochromic compounds include other naphthopyrans, benzopyrans, phenanthropyrans, spiro(benzindoline)naphthopyrans, spiro(indoline)benzopyrans, spiro{indoline)naphthopyrans, spiro(indoline)quinopyrans, spiro(indoline)pyrans, spiro(indoline)naphthoxazines, spiro(indolineJpyrido-benzoxazines, spiro(benzindoline)pyridobenzoxazines, spiro(benzindoline)naphthoxazines, spiro(indoline)-benzoxazines, and mixtures of such photochromic compounds.<br>
Each of the photochromic substances described herein may be used in amounts (or in a ratio) such that an organic host material to which the photochromic compounds or mixture of compounds is applied or in which they are incorporated exhibits a desired resultant color, e.g., a substantially neutral color when activated with unfiltered sunlight, i.e., as near a neutral color as possible given the colors of the activated photochromic compounds.<br>
A neutral gray color exhibits a spectrum that has relatively equal absorption in the visible range between 400 and 700 nanometers.  A neutral brown color exhibits a spectrum in which the absorption in the 400-550 nanometer range is moderately larger than in the 550-700 nanometer range.  An alternative way of describing color is in terms of its chromaticity coordinates, which describe the qualities of a color in addition to its luminance factor, i.e., its chromaticity.  In the CIE system, the chromaticity coordinates<br>
are obtained by taking the ratios of the tristimulus values to<br><br>
-18-<br>
their sum, e.g., x=X/(X+Y+Z) and y=Y/(X+Y+2).  Color as described in the CIE system can be plotted on a chromaticity diagram, usually a plot of the chromaticity coordinates x and y-  See. pages 47-52 of Principles of Color Technology, by F. W. Billmeyer, Jr., and Max Saltzman, Second Edition, John Wiley and Sons, N.Y. (1981).  As used herein, a near neutral color is one in which the chromaticity coordinate values of "x" and "y" for the color are within the following ranges (D65 illuminant): X = 0.260 to 0.400, y = 0.280 to 0.400 following activation to 40 percent luminous transmission by exposure to solar radiation (Air Mass 1 or 2) .<br>
The amount of photochromic substance or composition containing same applied to or incorporated into a host material is not critical provided that a sufficient amount is used to produce a photochromic effect discernible to the naked eye upon activation.  Generally such amount can be described as a photochromic amount.  The particular amount used depends often upon the intensity of color desired upon irradiation thereof and upon the method used to incorporate or apply the photochromic substances.  Typically, the more photochromic substance applied or incorporated, the greater is the color intensity up to a certain limit.<br>
The relative amounts of the aforesaid photochromic compounds used will vary and depend in part upon the relative intensities of the color of the activated species of such compounds, and the ultimate color desired.  Generally, the amount of total photochromic substance incorporated into or applied to a photochromic optical host material may range from about 0.0 5 to about 1.0, e.g., from 0.1 to about 0.45, milligrams per square centimeter of surface to which the photochromic substance(s) is incorporated or applied.<br>
The photochromic substances of the present invention may be applied to or incorporated into a host material such as a polymeric organic host material by various methods described in the art.  Such methods include dissolving or dispersing the photochromic substance within the host material, e.g., casting<br><br>
-19-<br>
it in place by adding the photochromic substance to the monomeric host material prior to polymerization; imbibition of the photochromic substance into the host material by immersion of the host material in a hot solution of the photochromic substance or by thermal transfer; providing the photochromic substance as a separate layer between adjacent layers of the host material, e.g., as a part of a polymeric film; and applying the photochromic substance as part of a coating placed on the surface of the host material.  The term "imbibition" or "imbibe" is intended to mean and include permeation of the photochromic substance alone into the host material, solvent assisted transfer of the photochromic substance into a porous polymer, vapor phase transfer, and other such transfer mechanisms.<br>
Compatible (chemically and color-wise) tints, i.e., dyes, may be applied to the host material to achieve a more aesthetic result, for medical reasons, or for reasons of fashion.  The particular dye selected will vary and depend on the aforesaid need and result to be achieved.  In one embodiment, the dye may be selected to complement the color resulting from the activated photochromic substances, e.g., to achieve a more neutral color or absorb a particular wavelength of incident light.  In another embodiment, the dye may be selected to provide a desired hue to the host matrix when the photochromic substances is in an unactivated state.<br>
The host material will usually be transparent, but may be translucent or even opaque.  The host material need only be transparent to that portion of the electromagnetic spectrum, which activates the photochromic substance, i.e., that wavelength of ultraviolet (UV) light that produces the open form of the substance and that portion of the visible spectrum that includes the absorption maximum wavelength of the substance in its UV activated form, i.e., the open form. Preferably, the host color should not be such that it masks the color of the activated form of the photochromic substance, i.e., so the change in color is readily apparent to the<br><br>
-20-<br>
observer.  More preferably, the host material article is a solid transparent or optically clear material, e.g., materials suitable for optical applications, such as piano and ophthalmic lenses, windows, automotive transparencies, e.g., windshields, aircraft transparencies, plastic sheeting, polymeric films, etc.<br>
Examples of polymeric organic host materials which may be used with the photochromic substances or compositions described herein include: polymers, i.e., homopolymers and copolymers, of polyol(allyl carbonate) monomers, diethylene glycol dimethacrylate monomers, diisopropenyl benzene monomers, ethoxylated bisphenol A dimethacrylate monomers, ethylene glycol bismethacrylate monomers, poly(ethylene glycol) bismethacrylate monomers, ethoxylated phenol methacrylate monomers and alkoxylated polyhydric alcohol acrylate monomers, such as ethoxylated trimethylol propane triacrylate monomers; polymers, i.e., homopolymers and copolymers, of polyfunctional, e.g., mono-, di- or multifunctional, acrylate and/or methacrylate monomers, poly(C1-C12 alkyl methacrylates), such as poly(methyl methacrylate), poly(oxyalkylene dimethacrylates), poly(alkoxylated phenol methacrylates), cellulose acetate, cellulose triacetate, cellulose acetate propionate, cellulose acetate butyrate, poly(vinyl acetate), poly(vinyl alcohol), poly(vinyl chloride), poly{vinylidene chloride), polyurethanes, thermoplastic polycarbonates, polyesters, poly(ethylene terephthalate), polystyrene, poly(alpha methylstyrene), copoly(styrene-methyl methacrylate), copoly(styrene-acrylonitrile), polyvinylbutyral and polymers, i.e., homopolymers and copolymers, of diallylidene pentaerythritol, particularly copolymers with polyol (allyl carbonate) monomers, e.g., diethylene glycol bis(allyl carbonate), and acrylate monomers.<br>
Transparent copolymers and blends of transparent polymers are also suitable as host materials.  Preferably, the host material is an optically clear polymerized organic<br><br>
-21-<br>
material prepared from a thermoplastic polycarbonate resin, such as the carbonate-linked resin derived from bisphenol A and phosgene, which is sold under the trademark, LEXAN; a polyester, such as the material sold under the trademark, MYLAR; a polytmethyl methacrylate), such as the material sold under the trademark, PLEXIGLAS; polymerizates of a polyol(allyl carbonate) monomer, especially diethylene glycol bis{allyl carbonate), which monomer is sold under the trademark "CR-39, and polymerizates of copolymers of a polyol {allyl carbonate), e.g., diethylene glycol bis(allyl carbonate), with other copolymerizable monomeric materials, such as copolymers with vinyl acetate, e.g., copolymers of from 80-90 percent diethylene glycol bis(allyl carbonate) and 10-20 percent vinyl acetate, particularly 80-85 percent of the bis(allyl carbonate) and 15-20 percent vinyl acetate, and copolymers with a polyurethane having terminal diacrylate functionality, as described in U.S. patents 4,360,653 and 4,994,208; and copolymers with aliphatic urethanes, the terminal portion of which contain allyl or acrylyl functional groups, as described in U.S. Patent 5,200,483; poly(vinyl acetate), polyvinylbutyral, polyurethane, polymers of members of the group consisting of diethylene glycol dimethacrylate monomers, diisopropenyl benzene monomers, ethoxylated bisphenol A dimethacrylate monomers, ethylene glycol bismethacrylate monomers, poly(ethylene glycol) bismethacrylate monomers, ethoxylated phenol methacrylate monomers and ethoxylated trimethylol propane triacrylate monomers; cellulose acetate, cellulose propionate, cellulose butyrate, cellulose acetate butyrate, polystyrene and copolymers of styrene with methyl methacrylate, vinyl acetate and acrylonitrile.<br>
More particularly, contemplated is use of the photochromic naphthopyrans of the present invention with optical organic resin monomers used to produce optically clear polymerizates, i.e., materials suitable for optical applications, such as for example piano and ophthalmic lenses,<br><br>
-22-<br>
windows, and automotive transparencies.  Such optically clear polymerizates may have a refractive index that may range from about 1.48 to about 1.75, e.g., from about 1.4-95 to about 1.66.  Specifically contemplated are optical resins sold by PPG Industries, Inc. under the designation CR-307 and CR-407.<br>
The present invention is more particularly described in the following examples which are intended as illustrative only, since numerous modifications and variations therein will be apparent to those skilled in the art.<br>
EXAMPLE 1 STEP 1 Potassium t-butoxide (75 grams, 0.67 mole) was added to a reaction flask containing 200 milliliters (mL) of toluene.  The reaction flask was equiped with an overhead stirrer, dropping funnel, and a condenser with nitrogen inlet. The contents of the reaction flask was heated to reflux temperature and a mixture of benzophenone (91 grams, 0.5 mole), dimethyl succinate (90 grams, 0.62 mole), and toluene (100 grams) was added over a period of one-half hour.  The resulting pasty mixture was refluxed an additional two hours, cooled, and about 400 mL of water was added and mixed well. The aqueous layer was separated, acidified, with dilute hydrochloric acid, and extracted with 200 mL of toluene.  The solvents, toluene and residual t-butanol, were removed on the rotary evaporator to produce a near quantitative yield of crude half-ester, 4,4-diphenyl-3-methoxycarbonyl-3-butenoic acids.  This material was not purified further but was used directly in the next step.<br>
STEP 2 The crude half-ester from Step 1 was added to a reaction flask containing 200 mL of toluene.  Acetic anhydride (100 grams) and anhydrous sodium acetate {15 grams) were added and the mixture was refluxed for 17 hours.  The mixture was cooled and the solvent, toluene, was removed on a rotary<br><br>
-23-<br>
evaporator. The resulting residue was dissolved in 200 mL of methylene chloride and stirred.  Water (2 00 mL) was added followed by the slow addition of solid sodium carbonate until carbon dioxide evolution ceased.  The methylene chloride layer was separated and washed with water.  The solvent, methylene chloride, was removed on a rotary evaporator to yield a viscous oil, containing primarily 1-phenyl-2-methoxycarbonyl-4-acetoxy-naphthalene.  This material was not purified further but was used directly in the next step.<br>
STEP 3 The oil containing l-phenyl-2-methoxycarbonyl-4-acetoxy-naphthalene from Step 2 was added to a reaction flask containing 400 mL of methanol.  Two mL of concentrated hydrochloric acid was added and the mixture was heated to reflux.  After approximately four hours, the volume of the mixture was reduced by half on a rotary evaporator.  As the mixture cooled, the product started to crystallize.  The resulting crystals were suction filtered, washed with fresh methanol, and dried.  The recovered product, 100 grams, had a melting point of 174-176°C and a nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum (NMR) showing the product to have a structure consistent with 4-phenyl-3-methoxycarbonyl-1-naphthol.<br>
STEP 4 The 4-phenyl-3-methoxycarbonyl-l-naphthol, 100 grams, from Step 3, was added to a reaction flask containing 350 mL of a 10 weight percent aqueous sodium hydroxide solution and 50 mL of methanol.  The mixture was refluxed for one hour, cooled, then slowly poured into a beaker containing approximately one liter of cold (approx. 4°C) dilute hydrochloric acid.  About 90 grams of the resulting crystalline product, 1-phenyl-4-hydroxy-2-naphthoic acid, having a melting point of 210-212°C, was collected by vacuum filtration.<br><br>
-24-STEP 5<br>
Thirty five grams of l-phenyl-4-hydroxy-2-naphthoic acid, from Step 4, was added to a reaction flask containing 35 grams of a 85 weight percent phosphoric acid solution.  The resulting mixture was heated to 190-200°C. and kept at this temperature for one hour.  During this time a deep red solid product formed.  The mixture was cooled and 200 mL of water was added.  The solid was broken up with a spatula, filtered, and washed successively with water, 5 weight percent aqueous sodium bicarbonate, and water.  Eighteen grams of the red colored product, 5-hydroxy-7H-benzo[C]-fluoren-7-one, were recovered by vacuum filtration.<br>
STEP 6 5-Hydroxy-7H-benzo[C]-fluoren-7-one (6 grams), from Step 5, was added to a reaction flask containing l,l-di(4-methoxyphenyl)-2-propyn-1-01 (6 grams) and 100 mL of toluene. The resulting mixture was stirred and heated to 50°C., three drops of dodecybenzene sulfonic acid were added, and the reaction mixture was kept at 50°C. for five hours.  After the reaction mixture cooled to room temperature, it was filtered and the collected filtrate was washed three times with 5 weight percent aqueous sodium hydroxide.  The solvent, toluene, was removed on a rotary evaporator and the desired product crystallized on the addition of acetone to the residue.  The solid was vacuum filtered, washed with fresh acetone, and dried to yield 6.2 grams of a red-orange colored product having a melting point of 190-191°C.  An NMR showed the product to have a structure consistent with 3,3-di(4-methoxyphenyl)-13-oxo-indeno[2,1-f]naphtho[1,2-b]pyran.<br>
STEP 7<br>
Three grams of 3,3-di(4-methoxyphenyl)-13-oxo-indeno[2,1-f]naphtho[1,2-b]pyran from Step 6, was added to a reaction flask containing 50 mL of anhydrous diethyl ether. Small portions of lithium aluminum hydride were added to the<br><br>
-25-<br>
stirred mixture until all of the red-orange color disappeared. The reaction mixture was stirred an additional ten minutes, quenched with a small amount of ethanol, and—poured into 200 mL of 5 weight percent aqueous hydrochloric acid.  The organic layer was separated, washed with water, filtered, and the solvent, diethyl ether, was removed on a rotary evaporator. The addition of approximately ten milliliters of a 2:1 mixture of hexane:ethyl acetate to the residue caused the crystallization of the desired product.  The recovered crystals were washed with a small amount of  a 2:1 mixture of hexane:ethyl acetate and dried to yield 2.6 grams of product having a melting point of 127-129°C.  An NMR spectrum showed the product to have a structure consistent with 3,3-di(4-methoxyphenyl)-13-hydroxy-indeno[2,1-f ] naphtho[1,2-b]pyran.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
The process of Example 1 was followed except that in Step 1,   three grams of 3,3-di(4-methoxyphenyl)-13-oxo-indeno [2 , 1-f ] naphtho [1, 2-b]pyran was added to a reaction flask containing 50 mL of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran.  The mixture was cooled in an ice bath and protected from moisture with a nitrogen pad while an excess of methyl Grignard reagent was added to the reaction with stirring.  After stirring an additional ten minutes, 200 mL of 5 weight percent aqueous hydrochloric acid was added and the organic layer was separated and washed with water.  The solvent, tetrahydrofuran, was removed on a rotary evaporator.  The addition of approximately ten milliliters of a 2:1 mixture of hexane:ethyl acetate to the residue caused the crystallization of a non photochromic material.  This material was separated by filtration.  The filtrate was column chromatographed on silica using a 3:1 mixture of hexane:ethyl acetate as elutant The desired product, which crystallized from ether, was filtered and dried to yield 0.7 grams of a product having a melting point of 125-126°C.  An NMR spectrum showed the product<br><br>
-26-<br>
to have a structure consistent with 3,3-di(4-methoxyphenyl)-13 -hydroxy-13-methyl-indeno[2,1-f]naphtho[1, 2-b]pyran.<br>
EXAMPLES 3 The process of Example 1 was followed except that in Step 6, 1-(2,3-dihydrobenzofur-5-yl)-1-(4-methoxyphenyl)-2-propyn-l-01 was used in place of 1,1-di(4-methoxyphenyl)-2-propyn-1-01.

Example 10<br>
Part A<br>
Testing was done with selected photochromic naphthopyrans imbibed into test square polymerizates.  The test square polymerizates were prepared from a diethylene glycol bistallyl carbonate) composition sold by PPG Industries, Inc. under the designation CR-307 optical resin and measured 1/4 inch (0.6 centimeters) x 2 inches (5.1 centimeters) x 2 inches (5.1 centimeters).  The test squares were imbibed by the following procedure.  Each naphthopyran was dissolved to form a 10 weight percent solution in a 1:9 mixture of ethyl cellulose:toluene.  The solution was then<br><br>
-30-<br>
spin coated onto the test squares and allowed to dry.  Samples were, then heated in a hot-air oven at 135-155°C for a period of time sufficient to thermally transfer the photochromic into the test squares.  After cooling, the ethyl cellulose/toluene resin film was removed from the test squares by washing with acetone.  The residence time in the oven for the test squares was adjusted to imbibe amounts of the naphthopyran compounds that would yield comparable absorbance values at the lambda max (UV) of the individual compounds.<br>
Part B The photochromic test squares of Part A were tested<br>
for photochromic response rates on an optical bench.  Prior to<br>
testing on the optical bench, the photochromic test squares<br>
were exposed to 365 nanometer ultraviolet light for about 15<br>
minutes to activate the photochromic compounds and then placed<br>
into a 76°C oven for about 15 minutes to bleach the<br>
photochromic compounds.  The test squares were then cooled to<br>
room temperature, exposed to fluorescent room lighting for at<br>
least 2 hours and then kept covered for at least 2 hours prior<br>
to testing on an optical bench maintained at 75°F (23.9°C).<br>
The optical bench comprises a 150 watt Xenon arc lamp, a tungsten lamp, power supplies for both lamps, condensing lenses as needed to maintain collimated light beams from both lamps, a remote controlled shutter, a copper sulfate bath acting as a heat sink for the arc lamp, a Schott WG-320 ran cut-off filter which removes short wavelength radiation, neutral density filter{s), a sample holder in which the sample to be tested is inserted, a photopic filter, light detector, and radiometer assembly, a strip chart recorder, and a means for maintaining the alignment of the aforestated components during testing.<br>
Change in optical density (? OD) of a sample was determined by inserting a photochromic test sample in the<br><br>
-31-<br>
bleached state into the sample holder, adjusting the transmittance scale to 100%, opening the shutter from the Xenon lamp to provide ultraviolet radiation to change the sample from the bleached state to an activated (darkened) state, measuring the transmittance through the sample.  The transmittance was measured by directing a beam of light from the tungsten lamp at a small angle normal to the surface of the sample, through the sample, and to a photopic filter, light detector and radiometer assembly.  The photopic filter passes wavelengths such that the detector mimics the response of the human eye and produces output signals that are processed by the radiometer.  The change in optical density was calculated according to the formula ? OD=log(100/%Ta) where %Ta is the percent transmittance in the activated state and the logarithm is to the base 10.<br>
The ? OD/Min, which represents the sensitivity of the photochromic compound's response to UV light, was measured over the first five (5) seconds of UV exposure, then expressed on a per minute basis.  The saturation optical density (OD) was taken under identical conditions as the ? OD/Min, except UV exposure was continued for 20 minutes.  The lambda max (Vis) is the wavelength in the visible spectrum at which the maximum absorption of the activated (colored) form of the photochromic compound in the test square occurs.  The bleach rate (T 1/2) is the time interval in seconds for the absorbance of the activated form of the naphthopyran in the test squares to reach one half the highest absorbance at room temperature (75°F, 23.9°C) after removal of the source of activating light.  Results for the compounds of the Examples are tabulated in Table 1.<br><br>
-32-<br>
Part C<br>
The principal products of the Example Compounds were dissolved in diethylene glycol dimethyl ether.  The concentration of the resulting solutions was approximately 0.5 milligram per milliliter.  Each solution was tested in a UV spectrophotometer to determine the wavelength in the ultraviolet range closest to the visible spectrum at which the absorption of the photochromic compound occurs.  These results are reported as the lambda (X)   max (UV) in Table 2.<br>
The lambda max (Vis) is the wavelength in the visible spectrum at which the maximum absorption of the activated (colored) form of the photochromic compound in a test square occurs.  The lambda max (Vis) wavelengths reported in Table 2 were determined by testing the photochromic test squares polymerizates of Part A on the optical bench of Part B.<br>
The molar absorptivity or molar extinction coefficient (e) reported in Table 2 is equal to the absorbance of the photochromic compound in a diethylene glycol dimethyl ether solution at the A. max in the UV (A) divided by the path length of the spectrophotometer cell (b) multiplied by the concentration of the photochromic compound solution in moles per liter (M) according to the formula: ? = A/bM.  The molar absorptivity was measured in a UV spectrophotometer for a 2x10-3 molar solution of selected Example compounds in a 0.1 centimeter quartz cell.<br><br>
