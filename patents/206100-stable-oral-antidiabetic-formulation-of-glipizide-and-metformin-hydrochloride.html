PREABLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed<br>
6-2-2006<br><br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to stable oral antidiabetic  formulation  of glipizide and metformin hydrochloride.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
Glipizide is an oral antihyperglycemic drug of sulfonylurea class used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes ie non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). Glipizide has the chemical narne l-cyclohexyl-3-[[p-[2-(5-methylpyrazinecarboxamido) ethyl]phenyl] sulfonyl] urea, molecular formula C21H27N5O4S and molecular weight 445.55. Glipizide has a pKa of 5,9 and is insoluble in water and alcohol but soluble in O.lNNaOH. Metformin hydrochloride is a biguanide class of oral antihyperglycemic drug used in the management of type 2 diabetes. Metformin hydrochloride whose chemical name is (N,N-dimethylimidodicarbonimidic diamide mono-hydrochloride) is not chemically or pharmacologically related to sulfonylureas, thiazolidinediones, or oc-glucosidase inhibitors. It has a molecular formula of C4H.12C1N5 (monohydrochloride) and a molecular weight of 165.63. Metformin hydrochloride is freely soluble in water and is ptracticaiiy insoluble in acetone, ether and chloroform. Metformin has a pKa of 12.4. Glipizide is known to Wer blood glucose acutely by stimulating the release of<br>
2<br><br>
insulin from the pancreas, whereas metformin hydrochloride is known to improve glucose tolerance in patients with type 2 diabetes, lowering both basal and postprandial plasma glucose.<br>
US Patent No 6,011,049 describes the use of a combination of a glitazone antidiabetic agent and a biguanide antidiabetic agent and optionally a sulfonylurea antidiabetic agent for treating diabetes mellitus and improving glycemic control. Glipizide being a sulfonylurea class is sensitive to degradation in the presence of acidic compounds like metformin hydrochloride with generation of impurities, mainly 'Glipizide Related Compound A' chemically known as [N-{2-[(4-aminosulfonyl)phenyl]ethyl}-5-methyl-pyrazinecarboxamide]. Degradation of glipizide is more pronounced at higher storage temperature because of which a high limit of 2% of impurity is allowed for Glipizide tablet in United States Pharmacopoeia 2003 (USP 26, page no. 859). Glipizide and metformin HC1 Tablets of Bristol-Myers Squibb, USA recently marketed under the brand name "Metalglip" are advised to be stored at low temperatures like 20°C - 25°C. In tropical countries like India the average temperature at most of the places most of the time is around 30°C." Therefore such drugs are likely to show pronounced degradation at such tropical climatic conditions. The "Metalglip" tablets comprise plain glipizide.<br>

Stability study:<br>
Stability studies of tablets of Examples 1,6, 11 and 14 were carried out to evaluate degradation of glipizide and generation of impurities, mainly 'glipizide impurity A' chemically known as [N-{2-[(4-aminosulfonyl)phenyl]ethyl}-5-methyl-pyrazinecarboxamide] over prolonged storage at room temperature and at higher temperatures. The impurity analysis was done using the gradient HPLC (High Pressure Liquid Chromatography) system equipped with 250 X 4.6 mm, CI8, 5 urn column and mobile phase of NaH2P04 buffer pH 6.0 : THF (500 :10) with Methanol and UV detector to estimate the percentage of impurity generation. The results were as shown in the following Tables:<br>

Example 14	impurity A	0.094	0.984	2.001<br><br>
	Total RS	0.121	1.261	2.156<br>
The Tables 1 to 3 clearly establish that the percentages of impurities generated over prolonged storage at room temperature and accelerated temperature are significantly reduced incase of the tablets of Examples 1, 6 and 11 containing inclusion complex of glipizide with cyclodextrin and non-ionic surfactant as compared to the tablets of Example 14 containing plain glipizide. Table 3 also shows in the case of tablets of Example 14 maximum rise in impurity to about 2.156 % at 40°C with 75% humidity.<br>
25<br><br>
According to the invention degradation of glipizide and generation of impurities is thus significantly reduced ithereby imparting stability to the tablets over a long storage period even at high temperature. Therefore, the tablets of the invention are also suitable for use in tropical conditions like in India. The process of the invention involves simple mixing, which is easy and economical to carry out and is also suitable for carrying out on a commercial scale.<br>

1.	A stable oral antidiabetic formulation of glipizide and metformin hydrochloride, the formulation comprising 250.2000 mg metformin hydrochloride and 2.5-40 mg glipizide in the form of an inclusion complex with cyclodextrin and non-ionic surfactant, in combination with pharmaceutically  acceptable excipients.<br>
