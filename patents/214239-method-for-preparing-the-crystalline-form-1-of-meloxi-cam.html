				<td>METH0D FOR PREPARING THE CRYSTALLINE FORM I OF MELOXICAM<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to the crystalline<br>
forms of meloxicam and to processes for their preparation<br>
and interconversion. More specifically, it relates to the<br>
new crystalline forms II, III and V of meloxicam; to the<br>
processes for obtaining said new crystalline forms II,<br>
III and V; and finally, to the processes for<br>
interconverting the forms II, III, IV and V into the form<br>
I.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Meloxicam, 4-hydroxy-2-methyl-N-(5-methyl-2-<br>
thiazolyl)-2H-1,2-benzothiazine-3-carboxamide 1,1-<br>
dioxide, is a known non-steroid anti-inflammatory drug<br>
(NSAID). Standard NSAID"s inhibit both the isoform COX-1<br>
ot cyclooxygenase, that is constitutively expressed in<br>
many tissues, and the isoform COX-2, that is expressed as<br>
a response to inflammatory mediators. Although current<br>
NSAID"s present certain differences in potency as<br>
inhibitors of these two enzymes, they generally inhibit<br>
both. From a theoretical standpoint at least it would<br>
therefore be advantageous to inhibit selectively COX-2<br>
(reducing the inflammation) without affecting COX-1<br>
(thereby leaving intact this enzyme, and thus reducing<br>
possible kidney and gastric damage). The importance of<br>
meloxicam in the pharmaceutical field is given by the<br>
fact that this compound selectively inhibits COX-2 with<br>
resnpect to COX-1 . Thus, meloxicam shows a selectivity<br>
that is 75 times greater for COX-2 compared to COX-1, in<br>
human recombinant enzymes. (Churchil L, Graham AC, Shih<br>
C-K, et al. Selective inhibition of human cyclooxygenase-<br>
2 by meloxicam. Inflammopharmacology, 1996; 4: 125-135).<br>
It is known that meloxicam shows. polymorphism, with<br>
two different crystalline forms known: the zwiterionic<br>
form (hereinafter referred to as form IV) and the enolic<br>
form, or form I. The crystalline form I is the one<br>
suitable for preparing pharmaceutical products (P. Luger<br>
et al. Eur. J. Pharm. Sci.., 1996, 175).<br>
Enolic form, or form I, of meloxicam (Formula A):<br>
Zwiterionic form, or form IV, of meloxicam (Formula<br>
B) :<br>
In the current state of the art, meloxicam is<br>
obtained by reacting isopropyl 4-hydroxy-2-methyl-2H-l,2-<br>
benzothiazine-3-carboxylate 1,1-dioxide (or other<br>
derivatives of carboxylic acid) and 2-amino-5-<br>
methylthiazol in xylene at reflux with partial<br>
distillation. The meloxicam thus obtained must be<br>
purified for adequate quality. Said purification is<br>
performed by crystallisation in organic solvents such as<br>
dichloroethane or 1,2-dichlorobenzene (see DE 2756113).<br>
The paper by P. Luger et al. Eur. J. Pharm. Sci., 1996,.<br>
175 describes the preparation of meloxicam, characterised<br>
as form I, by recrystallisation in non-polar solvents.<br>
This same document describes the preparation of the form<br>
IV or zwiterionic form by treating meloxicam in an<br>
aqueous medium with sodium hydroxide followed by acetic<br>
acid.<br>
The methods for obtaining the form I of meloxicam<br>
have the disadvantage of relyinq on orqanic solvents.<br>
This means that, in addition to the high cost of the<br>
solvent, it must be later removed and/or recovered. In<br>
addition, yields obtained by these crystallisation<br>
methods are moderate or relatively lew (
These documents do not discuss the possibility of<br>
interconverting the form IV into the form I, nor the<br>
temperature and time used in the crystallisations. They<br>
also do not describe the possibility of directly<br>
obtaining the form I in an aqueous medium by treatment<br>
with sodium hydroxide and acetic acid.<br>
Thus, there is a need for a method for preparing the<br>
form I of meloxicam that does not suffer from the<br>
drawbacks of known methods, as well as new crystalline<br>
forms that serve as intermediates or starting products<br>
for preparing the form I of meloxicam and, finally, for<br>
processes for preparing said crystalline forms.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
Through exhaustive and laborious research the<br>
inventors have developed a method by which,surprisingly,<br>
the form I of meloxicam can be obtained with excellent<br>
yields by cryscallisation of meloxicam in an aqueous<br>
medium, a medium hitherto described for obtaining the<br>
form IV. This implies an advantage over previous methods<br>
as it avoids using organic solvents, which imply a need<br>
of additional installations as well as harming the<br>
environment. This method also provides a suitable process<br>
for purification of meloxicam. Thus, an aspect of the<br>
present invention is a method for obtaining and purifying<br>
the form I of meloxicam from meloxicam.<br>
A second aspect of the invention consists of new<br>
crystalline forms of meloxicam, named forms II, III and<br>
V, as well as the processes for preparation thereof.<br>
these crystalline forms can serve as intermediates or<br>
pure starting products for preparing the form I, or even<br>
open paths for preparation of new pharmaceutical<br>
formulations of meloxicam.<br>
Finally, the inventors have developed processes<br>
allowing to convert the crystalline forms II, III, IV and<br>
V of meloxicam into the form I. This is thus the third<br>
aspect of the invention. These processes allow<br>
transforming the various crystalline forms of meloxicam<br>
into the form I, which is the forrr. currently used in<br>
pharmaceutical preparations of meloxicam.<br>
The present specification has 14 figures. Figures 1,<br>
2, 3, 4 and 5 show the infrared spectra of the<br>
crystalline forms I, II, III, IV and V of meloxicam.<br>
Figures 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 show the X-ray diffractograms<br>
of the crystalline forms I, II, III, IV and V of<br>
meloxicam. Finally, figures 11, 12, 13, and 14 show the<br>
Raman spectra of the crystalline forms I, II, III, IV and<br>
V of meloxicam.<br>
Detailed description of the invention<br>
As mentioned above, the first aspect of the present<br>
invention consists in a method for preparing meloxicam<br>
form I, represented by the Formula A,<br>
The first aspect of the invention consists in a<br>
method for preparing the crystalline form I of meloxicam,<br>
involving dissolving meloxicam in a mixture of water and<br>
NaOH, and the subsequent addition of an acid for<br>
precipitating the crystalline form I of meloxicam,<br>
maintaining during the process a temperature between 65°C<br>
and the reflux temperature.<br>
Throughout the present application document the term<br>
"meloxicam" refers to the crude product obtained in any<br>

state of the art; for example, by reacting isopropyl 4-<br>
hydroxy-2-methyl-2H-l,2-benzothiazine-3-carboxylate 1,1-<br>
dioxide (or other derivatives of carboxylic acid) and 2-<br>
amino-5-methylthiazol in xylene at reflux with partial<br>
distillation.<br>
The acid used in the reaction of the first aspect of<br>
the invention can be an organic or inorganic acid,<br>
preferably hydrochloric, acetic or methansulphonic acid,<br>
and more preferably acetic acid. The acid is preferably<br>
added until reaching a pH of 3 to 5.5. The temperature of<br>
such process, with the exception of the crystallisation<br>
step, is maintained between 65°C and the reflux<br>
temperature, preferably between 65°C and 80°C, and more<br>

solvent chosen from: an alcohol such as for example<br>
ethanol, xylene, toluene and dimethylformamide (DMF), and<br>
at a temperature that is maintained throughout the<br>
process between 50°C and the reflux temperature.<br>
The acid used, as in the previous process, is an<br>
organic or inorganic acid, preferably hydrochloric,<br>
acetic or methansulphonic acid, and more preferably<br>
acetic acid. The acid is preferably added until reaching<br>
a pH of 3 to 5.5. Preferred mixtures of solvents are:<br>
water/xylene 12.5:1 (v/v), water/DMF (v/v) between 1:1<br>
and 8:1 and, finally, water/ethanol (v/v) between 10:1<br>
and 1:1. The process temperature, with the exception of<br>
the precipitation step, is preferably between 50 and<br>
80°C, more preferably 50°C, 63°C or 70°C. The amount of<br>
NaOH added is preferably 1 to 1.5 equivalents of NaOH<br>
