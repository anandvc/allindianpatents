				<td>Electrical Circuit with Incendive Arc Prevention<br>
This invention relates to an electrical circuit with incendive arc prevention, for<br>
use particularly, but not exclusively, with an intrinsically safe Ethernet system.<br>
Conventional intrinsically safe electrical systems, and to a point the new<br>
generation of arc detection systems, use two wires to transmit power and signals,<br>
and only use these two wires for energy restriction and fault detection.<br>
US 5982594 in the name of KEVIN M HUCZKO discloses an intrinsically safe<br>
power supply unit which only uses two wires to transmit power. A direct output<br>
crowbar and discrete impedance elements are used to dissipate and limit the energy<br>
in the power supply unit that would otherwise be delivered to an external fault, and<br>
an adaptive shut down circuit distinguishes nominal load conditions including load<br>
changes from an external fault<br>
WO 2006/003445 in the name of PEPPERL AND FUCHS discloses an<br>
electrical circuit which uses two wires to transmit power and signals. In this case an<br>
incendive arc prevention means monitors the electrical circuit by means of a reactor<br>
means, and If either a short circuit with the potential to cause an incendive arc, or an<br>
event with a current and/or voltage pattern which is characteristic of a propagating<br>
non-incendive arc, occurs in the electrical circuit, the reaction of the reactor means is<br>
detected, and the power supply is fully or partially isolated from the event, such that<br>
an incendive arc cannot occur.<br>
In both of these documents the electrical circuits cannot adequately discem<br>
the difference between a load interruption, and an arc or cable fault and therefore<br>
react to load variations that do not have any load variation correction electronics.<br>
Therefore, an underlying problem with known arrangements is that either the system<br>
responds to a load change and shuts down, or complex electronic circuitry must be<br>
employed to correct load change disruption.<br>
 <br>
In addition, these known fault detection systems are only practical in circuits<br>
with a low voltage or current In particular, the sensitivity of a two wire system has to<br>
be adjusted to suit an absolute measurement and such an arrangement becomes<br>
less effective the greater the source voltage and/or load current and the greater the<br>
load step changes. For example, at one or two Amperes the sensitivity would have to<br>
be increased to a point where arc detection becomes ineffective.<br>
Furthermore, cable probing for static cable faults becomes more difficult with<br>
higher voltages and/or higher currents. Such probing is only effective with the load<br>
isolated, so the probing is in effect at steady state, and is not affected by capacitive<br>
loading and/or sensing element effects.<br>
Further problems lie at the point of load connection, where the transition to<br>
full power exhibits constant current characteristics not conducive to fault detection<br>
and/or arc prevention. Basically, known cable probes do not allow for loads, because<br>
they can be misinterpreted as a cable fault Furthermore, rectangular current limiting<br>
also reacts detrimentally to inrush currents caused by some loads whereby the<br>
transition stage could be insensitive to incendrve faults.<br>
However, with the introduction of Ethernet and similar cabled systems, cables<br>
can now contain at least four, and typically eight, cores. Four of these cables are<br>
usually allocated for power, using two techniques including phantom power or<br>
discrete power. Rgure 1 illustrates the cable arrangement for an Ethernet cable. A<br>
first twinned pair of cables transmit signals, second and third twinned pairs are<br>
power cables, and a fourth twinned pair of cables receives signals. Each pair of<br>
power cablers comprises a negative and a positive cables each. figure 1 also indicated<br>
that for higher transmission speeds, the cable lengths are limited to approximately<br>
one hundred and twenty meters.<br>
Figures 2a to 2d illustrate how the power lines in an Ethernet cable can be<br>
arranged in different combinations to transmit larger amounts of power to a device.<br>
In Figure 2a the power lines are arranged as a series coupling to increase the<br>
 <br>
voltage. In Figure 2b the power lines are arranged as a parallel coupling to increase<br>
the current. In Figure 2c the power lines are arranged in an AC powered version, and<br>
in Figure 2d the power lines are arranged to achieve phantdm power. Of course,<br>
there are many variations of the above, but in each case the utilisation of all the<br>
available lines allows for a greater power delivery than with only a single pair of<br>
cables.<br>
However, this use of multiple core cables does not normally support<br>
intrinsically safe circuits for use in hazardous areas containing combustible gases or<br>
liquids. (For example, WO 2004/032302 in the name of JOHANNSMEYER ET AL,<br>
discloses an electrical circuit in which continuous interruption is used to achieve<br>
intrinsic safety. Whilst this technique could be used for an Ethernet power cable,<br>
problems would arise in relation to modulating cross-talk, or interference, projected<br>
onto the remaining signal lines or any other lines in close proximity. As such this<br>
approach is not viable with an Ethernet cable.)<br>
The present invention is intended to overcome some of the above described<br>
problems,<br>
Therefore, according to the present invention an electrical circuit comprises a<br>
power supply, a load, a first pair of parallel positive cables between the power supply<br>
and the load, a first pair of parallel negative cables between the load and the power<br>
supply, and incendive arc prevention means, in which the incendive arc prevention<br>
means comprises monitoring means adapted to monitor the first pair of positive<br>
cables and the first pair of negative cables, and to detect if the current and/or<br>
voltage and the first pair of negative cables, and to detect if the first pair of positive<br>
current and/or voltage in one of the first pair of negative cables deviates from the<br>
other, and in which the incendive arc prevention means comprises a control means<br>
adapted to fully or partially isolate the power supply from the first pair of positive<br>
cables and the first pair of negative cables if the monitoring means detects that the<br>
current and/or voltage of one of the first pair of positive cables has deviated from the<br>
 <br>
other, or if the current and/or voltage of one of the first pair of negative cables has<br>
deviated from the other.<br>
Therefore, the electrical circuit of the present invention utilises four cables not<br>
only for power distribution, but to also discern the difference between a load<br>
attachment or variation and a fault with the potential to be an incendive arc. A load<br>
attachment or variation will affect both cables of a pair in the same way, while a fault<br>
will not and therefore load influences can be ignored, and only cable faults<br>
considered.<br>
In addition, as the incendive arc prevention means operates on the principal<br>
of detecting a difference between active cables, as opposed to just monitoring a<br>
single cable at one point, it can rely on a relative measurement between the cables<br>
to discern faults, rather than relying on an absolute measurement As such, the<br>
electrical circuit can be made far more sensitive to potential incendive fault<br>
measurements, yet use higher quiescent or line currents.<br>
Furthermore, the four wire system has intrinsic protection because should one<br>
polarity line make or break, then the other same polarity line will demand the major<br>
portion of the total current, because ft will be of a lower resistance than the broken<br>
line, effectively starving the fault of most if not all of the incendive energy. This is the<br>
essence of bi-pinning utilised for non arcing connection in increased safety<br>
applications within Zone one or equivalent environments.<br>
it must be also noted that any power disruption during normal operation, may,<br>
for hybrid multi-core power/signal lines, affect the communication lines by by way of<br>
crosstalk.<br>
It will be appreciated that there are several ways that the pairs of cables can<br>
be monitored in order to detect a difference occurring between them.. For example, in<br>
one embodiment of the invention the monitoring means can be adapted to<br>
 <br>
separately monitor the current and/or voltage in both the positive cables and both<br>
the negative cables in order to discern if the current and/or the voltage of one of the<br>
first pair of positive cables, or one of the first pair of negative cables, deviates from<br>
the other. Such separate monitoring can be achieved with reactors in the known way.<br>
As an alternative to this arrangement, the electrical circuit can comprise a<br>
common positive section between the power supply and the load, or a common<br>
negative section between the load and the power supply, and the monitoring means<br>
can be adapted to separately monitor the current and/or voltage in one of the<br>
positive cables, in one of the negative cables, and in the common positive section or<br>
the common negative section, whichever is provided. The control means can then be<br>
adapted to fully or partially isolate the power supply from the first pair of positive<br>
cables and the first pair of negative cables if the current and/or voltage in the one<br>
positive cable or the one negative cable deviates from substantially half the current<br>
and/or voltage in the common positive section or the common negative section,<br>
whichever is provided. This arrangement reduces the number of monitoring points<br>
required to three.<br>
However, in a preferred embodiment of the invention the monitoring means<br>
can rely on the magnetization of common inductive reactor cores to detect a<br>
divergence in the cables. As such, the monitoring means can comprise an inductive<br>
reactor situated at a first end of each of the first pair of positive cables and a first<br>
end of each of the first pair of negative cables, and the two inductive reactors at the<br>
first end of the first pair of positive cables can share a first common core, and the<br>
two inductive reactors at the first end of the first pair of negative cables can share a<br>
second common core. A first sensor coil can than be would round the first common<br>
core 8nd a second sensor coif can be wound round the second common core.<br>
With this arrangement, the common cores will be held In a demagnetized<br>
state when the current and/or voltage in the cables remains equal, but it will<br>
 <br>
immediately become magnetized as soon as there is any divergence, and this<br>
magnetization can be detected by the sensor coil.<br>
Preferably the first sensor coil and the second sensor coil can be fed to<br>
window comparators adapted to drive an isolation means adapted to fully or partially<br>
isolate the power supply from the first pair of positive cables and the first pair of<br>
negative cables as soon as signals are received from the first sensor coil or the<br>
second sensor coil.<br>
The isolation means comprises a simple series element, or it: can comprise a<br>
shunt element, which provides certain power dumping advantages described below<br>
in relation to the figures. Alternatively both can be used.<br>
In a preferred construction an inductive reactor can be situated at a second<br>
end of each of the first pair of positive cables, and at a second end of each of the<br>
first pair of negative cables. The two inductive reactors at the second end of the first<br>
pair of positive cables can share a third common core, and the two inductive reactors<br>
at the second end of the first pair of negative cables can share a fourth common<br>
core. It will be appreciated that this arrangement makes the whole circuit far more<br>
sensitive to detecting divergence in the cables, as the reaction in the common cores<br>
wiil be magnified.<br>
Although not strictly necessary, it is also possible for the monitoring means to<br>
further comprises a third sensor coil would round the third common core and a fourth<br>
sensor coil would round the fourth common core. As above, the third sensor coil and<br>
the fourth sensor coll can be fed to window comparators.adapted to drive an isolation<br>
means, although this time the isolation means can be situated at the load end of the<br>
circuit This arrangement allows the cables to be safely doubled in length as an<br>
isolation means will never be more than the ideal 120 metres from any potential<br>
fault.<br>
 <br>
All the inductive reactors described above can be provided with resistive<br>
shunts.<br>
In the simpler versions of the invention described above in which each of the<br>
lines is separately monitored, the control means can be any known type of function<br>
circuit, for example a processor or calculator.<br>
In these versions of the invention each of the first pair of positive cables can<br>
be provided wfth a diode at its load end, and each of the first pair of negative cables<br>
can be provided with a diode at its load end. This arrangement prevents reverse<br>
current injection from any inductive and/or capacitive load or other energy storing<br>
load, which effectively isolates each line from each other for detection purposes.<br>
In a preferred construction the electrical circuit can be provided with a control<br>
means which is adapted to re-connect the power supply to the cables a pre-<br>
determined time after it has been isolated therefrom in use. This arrangement allows<br>
an event in the circuit to be identified in safety. In particular, the control means can<br>
isolate the power supply from the cables as soon as any event is detected, then<br>
discern the nature of the event when the power is reconnected. If the current<br>
measurement in each line exhibits a common mode or equal rate of change<br>
indicative of a load demand or balanced charging components, then the power<br>
remains connected, however, should the current change be unbalanced, which would<br>
be indicative of a cable fault, then the power will be isolated again. This process can<br>
repeat cyclically until the cable fault has been cleared.<br>
One problematic area to be considered is where connectors are used to<br>
couple the cable to the load or device. At disconnection, two circuits may be<br>
disconnected at the same time, which may lead to two simultaneous incendive arcs,<br>
exhibiting the same resistive characteristics. Should this be the case, then the two<br>
arcs could be misinterpreted as a common load change, and therefore, the power<br>
supply will not be safely isolated.<br>
 <br>
To avoid this occurrence there are many solutions, but in one version of the<br>
invention the first pair of positive cables and/or the first pair of negative cables can<br>
be provided with a connector at one end comprising two pins, one for each cable,<br>
and the two pins can be different lengths. With this arrangement, upon<br>
disconnection/connection there will always be an unbalance indicative of a fault, and<br>
as such the control means will react or shutdown until both the pins have made and<br>
all faults are cleared. This technique can comprise differing solutions, for example<br>
there may be an interlock that when removed/applied disrupts one of the lines to<br>
invoke a power supply shutdown and so on.<br>
As referred to above, the invention is intended to be used with an Ethernet<br>
cable, and therefore the electrical circuit can comprises one or more second pairs of<br>
parallel positive cables between the power supply and the load, and one or more<br>
second pairs of parallel negative cables between the load and the power supply.<br>
These second parrs of cables can be provided with their own intrinsic safety in any of<br>
the known ways. However, as an alternative the monitoring means can be adapted to<br>
monitor the one or more second pairs of positive cables and the one or more second<br>
pairs of negative cables, and in each case to detect if the current and/or voltage in<br>
one of any of the pairs of cables deviates from the other. As such all the cables in an<br>
Ethernet cable can be included in the system.<br>
In one version of the invention if the monitoring means detects that the<br>
current and/or voltage of one of any of the pairs of cables deviates from the other,<br>
the control means can fully or partially isolate the power supply from that pair of<br>
cables and its corresponding opposite polarity pair of cables only. As such, if a fault<br>
	occurs in the primary power cables of an Ethernet cable, then the power can be<br>
maintained to the signal/phantom power cables, and visa versa. Alternatively, the<br>
control mean can fully or partially isolate the power supply from all the cables.<br>
In one version of the invention the electrical circuit can be provided with a<br>
connector comprising pins from two or more positive cables and two or more<br>
 <br>
negative cables, and the pins from the two or more positive cables can be grouped<br>
together, and the pins from the two or more negative cables can be grouped<br>
together. Such an arrangement reduces the possibility of incendive arcing because<br>
no incendive arc can form between pins of the same polarity.<br>

Referring first to Figure 3, it is understood that an arc will typically exhibit no<br>
less than twenty ohms, and no more than seventy ohms during the first ten micro<br>
seconds. As such, an arc will not be incendive for the first ten micro seconds in most<br>
cases, although in some cases this is more, in other cases less.<br>
 <br>
Therefore, if an arc is to be quenched it must be detected and appropriate<br>
action taken within the first 10 microseconds or less. Figure 4 illustrates that a cable<br>
propagation delay, accounting for arc detection and arc exhaust, must be witnin 10<br>
micro seconds so an arc will not become incendive. This makes the cable<br>
propagation length limit five microseconds. Therefore, if a cable has a propagation<br>
time of six micro seconds per kilometre, then the length of cable must be limited to<br>
eight hundred and thirty meters.<br>
However, the electronic detection of an arc requires some time to operate<br>
effectively, and therefore in practice a cable length of four hundred meters is<br>
considered a practical limit Therefore, an Ethernet cable restricted to one hundred<br>
and twenly meters allows a significant margin, and also attows the possiblity of<br>
power exceeding twenty five watts, and possibly up to one hundred watts or more.<br>
Figures 5 and 6 show a first embodiment of the invention. Figure 5 shows two<br>
pairs of power cables, Pair A and Pair B, in an Ethernet cable, which are arranged<br>
with the two positive eables +ve (a) and +ve (b) In parallel, and the two negative<br>
cables -ve [a] amd -ve [b] in parallel. It can be understood from this diagram that as<br>
the impedance Za of Pair A is similar to the impedance Zb of Pair B, a load Rload<br>
attachment or a variation activated by a switch SW1, will demand a current lload<br>
equally distributed between the pairs. For example, current l[+a], l[-a], l[+b], l[-b], will<br>
Increase to a sfmttar level at a similar time. (This is iHustrated m Figure 11, where it<br>
can be seen that on switch activation 31, the load demand 27 is N Amperes and the<br>
distributed current 29,30, through each pair Pair A and Pair B is equal or N/2<br>
Amperes, allowing for tolerance 28.)<br>
Figure 6 shows the same circuit shown in Figure 5, but the positive cables and<br>
the negative cables are shown side by side for ease of explanation. Figure 6<br>
illustrates how fault detection and load differentiation is accomplished where the<br>
cable is arranged in the hazardous area 10 as two positive cables connected<br>
together, and two negative cables connected together. Intersect blocking diodes 4<br>
 <br>
and 7 are provided on the cables, and they serve to prevent reverse current injection<br>
from any inductive and/or capacitive load, or other energy storing load, so the lines<br>
are effectively isolated from each other for detection purposes.<br>
The current and/or voltage in/at each line is monitored in any of the known<br>
ways by an incendive arc prevention means comprising a monitoring means and a<br>
control means (not shown), and if there is a similar (common mode) change in each<br>
line, then this will be indicative of a connection or disconnection of load 6 or power<br>
sources 1 or 11, or of a load or supply variation, change or demand. In other words a<br>
common mode change in the lines will indicate a normal non-incendive event.<br>
However, should there be a differential change in each line, then this will be<br>
indicative of either a series resistance 3 or change 2, or a shunt resistance 9 or<br>
change 8 within the cable system 10. If everything is operating normally then this<br>
differential change can only occur with the cable system 10. The diodes 4 and 7<br>
assist in the detection of a shunt fault 9, as without them detection would be difficult<br>
because the current would be redistributed amongst the remaining cables-<br>
The detected resistance change in the cable system 10 may comprise a shunt<br>
or series arc with or without an incendive potential, or a cable break or short circuit<br>
As described above, a propagating arc typically has a resistance of between twenty<br>
and seventy ohms, and such a step resistance change in a given line must be<br>
detectable and discernabte. The system has an upper and Sower detection threshold,<br>
and anything beyond these thresholds is non-incendive. At the lower end, if an event<br>
can't be detected then ft is not incendive, whereas at the upper end, if the shunt<br>
resistance is greater than one thousand ohms, and the suppty voltage is forty eight<br>
volts, then any subsequent break will not be incetive (Transltinal voltage is farty may<br>
not be detectable, nevertheless this must be at a rate of no more than one in one<br>
thousand or better.)<br>
The monitoring means (not shown) only need to take measurements once in<br>
each loop to assess the differential mode change in current Once the detection of a<br>
 <br>
cable fault is made, the adequate isolation of power to the fault in a timely manner is<br>
performed by the control means (not shown), in order to interrupt the fault or arc<br>
from becoming incendlve. This can be done in any of the known ways, and the<br>
isolation of the power must occur within the first ten microseconds, and must be to a<br>
level and time that prevents the arc from becoming incendive, for example the power<br>
may be isolated by a shunt clamp or a series switch for a period of 10 microseconds.<br>
One advantage of this four wire system is that a break or a break arc along<br>
one cable will cause current to be shunted onto the remaining cables, with a<br>
consequential reduction in power available to the break or break arc. The reduction is<br>
obviously proportional to the system components and the nature of the fault.<br>
Following the interruption, the control means (not shown) reconnects the<br>
power supply immediately, provided the current measurement in each line exhibits a<br>
common mode or equal rate of change indicative of a load demand or balanced<br>
charging components. However, should the current change be unbalanced, which<br>
would be Indicative of a cable fault, the control means repeatedly Isolates and<br>
reinstates the power supply until the cable fault has been cleared.<br>
One problematic area to be considered is where connectors are used to<br>
couple the pairs of cables to the load 6. At disconnection, two circuits may be<br>
disconnected at the same time, which may lead to two simultaneous incendlve arcs,<br>
exhibiting the same resistive characteristics. If this occurred then the two arcs could<br>
be misinterpreted as a common load change by the control means and it would not<br>
safely isolate the power supply.<br>
There are several ways to overcome this problem and Figure 7 illustrates one<br>
solution comprising a plug 13 and socket 14 arrangement in which connecting pins<br>
15 are different lengths. One pin is deliberately set shorter than the other pins, as<br>
shown at 12, so that two circuits cannot be disconnected or connected<br>
simultaneously. Instead, upon disconnection or connection there is always an<br>
 <br>
unbalance indicative of a fault, and the control means isolates the power supply until<br>
all the pins have made, and all possible faults are cleared. From there the control<br>
means operates as normal and monitors the cables for a differential mode<br>
disruption. (This technique can be altered slightly, for example one pin can be longer<br>
than the others rather than shorter, or an interlock can be provided which disrupts<br>
one of the lines during disconnection or connection in order to invoke the control<br>
means to isolate the power supply.)<br>
It is theoretically possible for two poles to short simultaneously to the two<br>
opposite poles, and if this happened an incendive situation would occur without a<br>
reaction. (This is of course exactly the same for classic isolated IS circuits where two<br>
positive poles shorted to two negative poles is incendive.) However, this possibility<br>
can be discounted, because it would require i) both the matched positive lines<br>
and/or both the matched negative lines to be cut or break simultaneously, ii) for both<br>
pairs to simultaneously arc, Hi) for both pairs to do so with a perfectly matching arc<br>
impedance, iv) for both pairs to be at an incendive potential on the first strike, v) for<br>
there to be an incendive gas/air mixture at the point of the cut in a Zone 1<br>
environment, and vi) for the arc or arcs to ignite it.<br>
When one considers that a "simultaneous" cut or break would have to be<br>
within a few hundred billionths of a second for the electronics in the system to miss<br>
it, then it can be seen that the event is an unlikely scenario, and certainly less likely<br>
than encountering an unusual single incendive arc that could be missed by known<br>
systems. (In fact, a single series element current limiter failing short circuit with a<br>
subsequent redundant series element failing short circuit without detection, is a<br>
	more probable scanario Equality, two arcs from two independent and isolated known<br>
intrinsically safe circuits could be set off within a few millimetres of each other and<br>
combine the localised arc power to become incendive. However, this is not<br>
considered as a likely scenario by the major test houses and is normally discounted.)<br>
 <br>
Figure 8 illustrates a possible means by which the control means described<br>
above can isolate the power supply from the circuit upon cable fault detection. In this<br>
case a series element 19 is used to break the circuit but variations could include<br>
shunt clamps and/or series elements. The driver IS for the series element 19<br>
comprises a deadband function or hysteresis, so it doesn't fall into an oscillatory<br>
state, and also so the series element 19 is adequately isolated for a required period<br>
of time to fully quench an arc. An alternative to an analogue deadband could<br>
comprise a mono-stable element, a flip-flop element or a timer circuit and so on.<br>
The input 16 is referenced to a set point 17 so tolerances, such as<br>
background noise, LRC unbalance or interruptions that may be considered safe, are<br>
ignored. During a fault condition, the control means must repeat it's cyclical isolation<br>
and reconnection of the power supply in such a way that any incendive condition do<br>
not occur. In this case it uses a cyclic waveform repetition of one hundred kilohertz,<br>
but this could be greater.<br>
Figures 9a to 9d illustrate possible monitoring means as referred to above<br>
and for use with the above described circuit, which are adapted to monitor the cables<br>
for faults. In Figures 9a a resistive current measurement is used to monitor line 23.<br>
In Figure 9b an inductive reactor 22L with optional clamping resistor 22 Is used. In<br>
Figure 9c an AC coupling 24 which allows DC elimination for high-line measurement<br>
is used, and Figure 9d illustrates the introduction of transformer coupling that may<br>
also include voltage amplification or attenuation. It must be noted that at this point,<br>
that as any differential mode measurement must be made within the first ten<br>
microseconds, the detection can comprise AC and/or DC measurement<br>
The monitoring means shown in Figures 9a to 9d are used separately on each<br>
of the four lines, so there are at least four measurement points. However, Figure 17<br>
illustrates an alternative arrangement utilising a bridge network in order to reduce<br>
the number of measurement points to two. Inductors are used as in Figure 9b, and<br>
 <br>
each path is shown with an optional isolating transformer, which can be used when<br>
phantom power is required.<br>
It will be appreciated that the above described monitoring means are just<br>
examples and that there are many other ways the same results can be achieved.<br>
Those skilled in the art will be able to implement adequate measurement techniques<br>
and to design them in accordance with EN50020 or the equivalent<br>
Figure 10 illustrates a control means as referred to above and for use with the<br>
above described circuit, which comprises a function 25, which could be a processor<br>
or calculator. The function 25 is adapted to analyse Incoming event signals from<br>
each line i[+a] to i{-b], and to transmit a power isolation signal 26 if required. For<br>
isolated loops the number of input lines can be reduced to two. The function 25 is<br>
adapted to discern common mode influence from differential mode influence, noise<br>
and optionally, non incendive differential mode influence. The circuit in function 25<br>
can be a fast digital processor or analogue to digital logic circuit for the decision<br>
process. Such circuits can be designed by those skilled in ihe art, and will not be<br>
further described here.<br>
Figure 11 illustrates the type of event which would be ignored. A common<br>
mode switch on activation 31 leads to a load demand 27, and the distributed current<br>
29,30, through each loop is equal, allowing for tolerance 28.<br>
Figure 12 illustrates different incoming event signals which are indicative of<br>
common mode or differential mode events, and which can be discerned in order to<br>
indicate what type of fault has occurred. Firstly,current singnature 32 is a comman<br>
mode disruption with tolerance, which is indicative of a common mode step change<br>
as a result of power up, and/or a load change, such as that illustrated in Figure 11. It<br>
is not a cable fault or an unbalanced cable disruption, and if such signals were<br>
received by the function 25 they would be ignored, it would not transmit a power<br>
isolation signal 26.<br>
 <br>
However, current signature 33 is typical of a cut in any of the lines, including a<br>
propagating arc across the cut. The current l[+a] in one positive cable has increased,<br>
while the current l[+b] in the other positive cable has decreased. If such incoming<br>
signals were received by the function 25, it would transmit the power isolation signal<br>
26 to actively isolate the power supply from the fault.<br>
Curve signature 34 is typical of a shunt short or shunt arc between one of the<br>
two positive poles, and one of the two negative poles. Again, if such incoming signals<br>
were received by the function 25, it would transmit the power isolation signal 26<br>
to actively isolate the power supply from the fault. Any other types of incoming signals<br>
will not be incendive, for example a positive pole to positive pole short circuit will not<br>
be incendive, and equally, a negative pole to negative poie short circuit will not be<br>
incendive.<br>
It will be appreciated that any cable leakage or resistive failure, including a<br>
connector failure, can also be detected by the function 25 for preventative<br>
maintenance purposes. For example, a slow increase in current for one pair could be<br>
detected, and this would be indicative of water ingress and so on.<br>
The control means can be arranged so it will react only to arcs which actually<br>
have the potential to become incendive, and will ignore arcs that would not become<br>
incendive. For example, if a resistive fault occurs, and it is a differential mode fault,<br>
then the power supply may not need to be isolated from the fault if the path's<br>
resistance is high enough to limit the power to the arc. Such an event can be<br>
discerned because it will not have the characteristic of a constant current device.<br>
The above described circuit could be enhanced by having an infallible<br>
collapsing circuit at the load 6 point, and/or an infallible capacitive load that forces<br>
the load into quasi-constant resistance and/or constant fixed voltage. This technique<br>
may be beneficial in some instances, but it will only provide minor advantages at<br>
lower currents because the energy stored in a given cable length is mainly a factor of<br>
 <br>
current However, the cable length, and therefore the inductance, is quite low in<br>
Ethernet so the advantages of maintaining constant voltage at the load point may be<br>
beneficial. However, having said that, the above described control means will react<br>
faster than the cable discharge time, so if the arc can be quenched within the 10<br>
microsecond timeframe, the benefit of such systems may be questionable.<br>
Figure 13a illustrates a possible way to achieve the above, in which a<br>
collapsing circuit similar to that described in WO 2006/003445, is used to fix a<br>
minimum load resistance. Figure 13b, illustrates an alternative arrangement in which<br>
a fixed capacitor is utilised to maintain a quasi resistance limit The potential in any<br>
arc is dictated by the voltage cross the load, the power supply voltage and/or the<br>
back e.m.f. voltage generated across the arc, so these arrangements will reduce the<br>
potential potential across any arc. However, for circuits requiring high power the<br>
minimal resistance levels will be only slightly advantageous.<br>
It will be appreciated that the above described four wire circuit could be<br>
expanded to include further pairs of wires, and this is particularly applicable in an<br>
Ethernet cable with its eight wires. For example, Figure 14a illustrates a circuit in<br>
which all of the four pairs of wires in an Ethernet cable are monitored for fault<br>
discerning, as shown at 50, and not just the two pairs of power lines or the two pairs<br>
of signal/phantom power lines. Figure 14b illustrates a circuit in which the<br>
signal/phantom power lines are utilised for fault discerning alongside the power<br>
lines, as shown at 51. In this circuit the control means will isolate the power supply<br>
from ail the lines if a fault is detected in any of them, and in particular where a power<br>
line arcs over to, or is shorted to, a signal/phantom power line. This arrangement is<br>
advantageous when the signal/phantom power lines are used to compliment the<br>
power distribution. Of course, galvanic isolation and/or segregation may prevent the<br>
need for such an arrangement.<br>
As an alternative, the signal/phantom power lines can be made intrinsically<br>
safe separately from the main power lines. Figure 16 illustrates a circuit in which the<br>
 <br>
signal/phantom power lines and the main power lines are monitored for fault<br>
discerning separately from one another, as shown at 53 and 54. As such the control<br>
means will only isolate the power supply from the part of the circuit which<br>
experiences the fault. This means the signal/phantom power lines can remain<br>
operational if a fault occurs on the main power lines. The signal/phantom power lines<br>
can be monitored in the same way as the power lines, or they can be made<br>
intrinsically safe separately from the power lines in any of the known ways, for<br>
example by being low power.<br>
In either of the above two arrangements the voltage in the signal/phantom<br>
power lines can be elevated to prevent arcing between cables of the same polarity<br>
from the main power lines and the signal/phantom power lines.<br>
As Ethernet is arranged as pairs of positive and negative cables, an arc could<br>
from between any adjacent cables. However, no arcs will form between cables of the<br>
same polarity, therefore, in any of the above described circuits connectors are used<br>
which group the positive lines and the negative lines into two groups,, to minimise the<br>
potential for incendive faults. Figure 15 illustrates such a connector in which all the<br>
positive lines 52+, (which have voltages within twenty percent of each other), are<br>
positioned together, and so are all of the negative lines 52-. As such only the two<br>
adjacent positive and negative lines present the possibility of an incendive arc,<br>
although It will obviously be dealt with in the event of a fault This arrangement may<br>
also apply to other lines in close proximity, however it will not be a consideration for<br>
connectors with adequate clearance between the lines.<br>
The above described circuits work in theory, but they are limited by the quality<br>
of the components available. For example, the diodes 4 and 7 in Figure 6 would have<br>
to be 'ideal diodes'for the circuit shown therein to function correctly, and in practice<br>
ordinary diodes are not efficient enough. In addition, there are some faults that can<br>
lead to an incendive arc which would not be detected by the above described circuits,<br>
particularly under a high load and a high source voltage. For example its possible for<br>
 <br>
an oxide layer or a bridge to form between lines or terminals at a slow rate, and at a<br>
resistance or rate that cannot be detected under all load conditions, and such a fault<br>
might not be resistively safe at a given source voltage, and an arc could form through<br>
a fault in the bridge if the oxide layer breaks open or parts to form an arc. This type of<br>
fault scenario differs from a resistive oxide layer falling across the terminals, which<br>
can be detected quite easily. It is therefore necessary for a practical circuit to use an<br>
alternative arrangement to increase the sensitivity.<br>
Figure 18 illustrates two alternative circuit arrangements which are sensitive<br>
enough to detect faults like that described above, and which do not require any<br>
diodes. Instead, inductive reactors 55 or 57 are placed at each end of each line,<br>
replacing or complimenting the exampled diodes. The reactors 55 are simple<br>
inductors with optional resistive shunts, and the reactors 57 are the same but with<br>
common cores. Measurement of the reactor can be performed by direct connection,<br>
or by a further winding (not shown), as illustrated in Figure 9d.<br>
Figure 19 illustrates an electrical circuit like that described above, but which<br>
uses AC power instead of DC, and in which Pair A and Pair B are isolated from each<br>
other. Each pair is monitored, as shown at 59 and 58, and the measurements<br>
compared. Similar loading or delta change within each pair will be attributed to<br>
loading and/or switching, and will be ignored by the control means, whereas a<br>
differential change will be attributed to a fault or a potentially incentive arc, and<br>
appropriate action will be taken. Isolation between pairs could also illuminate the<br>
requirement for cross-fault detection.<br>
The circuit shown in Figure.19 has a further advantage. The transformers 62<br>
and 63 are constructed with intrinsically safe segregation in accordance with<br>
EN5O020, such that they have an intrinsically safe side IS and a non-intrinsically safe<br>
side MS. As such, one or more windings 61 a-n can be used for non-intrinsically safe<br>
circuits, and one or more winding 60a-n can be used for intrinsically safe circuits.<br>
 <br>
Further windings (not shown) can be attached for additional fault detection and/or<br>
power quenching or damping by way of shorted turns.<br>
Means by which the control means can isolate the power supply from the<br>
electrical circuit can be applied to any point in the circuit including in Pair A or Pair<br>
B, and can comprise shunt and/or series elements. The electrical circuit can operate<br>
at fifty or sixty Hertz AC power, however for greater efficiency and without<br>
compromising the integrity and cost, four-hundred Hertz is more effective. Four-<br>
hundred Hertz is also advantageous because multiple intrinsically safe and non-<br>
intrinsically safe interfaces are achievable on one former. Linear four hundred hertz<br>
technology also has distinct advantages over non-linear isolated switching regulators<br>
because the transformers are less expensive, they have better tolerance to<br>
segregation, the component count is reduced, the integrity is increased and the noise<br>
influence is negligible. The isolated Pairs A and B can also be converted to DC if<br>
required.<br>
Figure 20 illustrates a practical working electrical circuit using the above<br>
described arrangements. Balanced resistors with balanced mutual inductors are<br>
provided at each end of each pair of lines. As such the common cores are held in a<br>
demagnetized state when the current and/or voltage in the cables remains equal,<br>
but immediately become magnetized as soon as there is any divergence, The<br>
inductor nearest to the power supply incorporates a third winding for fault detection.<br>
As soon as the common core becomes magnetized this will be detected by the sensor<br>
coil. However it will be appreciated that other methods of monitoring the lines could<br>
be used instead, for example a resistor bridge. In this circuit the monitoring is only<br>
performed at one end of the cable, however it will be appreciated that a only<br>
arrangement can be provided at the load end of the cable, so fault detection and<br>
power quenching can take place at both ends of the circuit.<br>
 <br>
The above described electrical circuit can be altered in various ways to<br>
achieve various ends, and a number of alternative constructions are described<br>
below.<br>
It should be noted here that it may be necessary to place diodes strategically,<br>
in line or In shunt, around the circuit in order to satisfy EN50020. As such the means<br>
by which the power supply is isolated from the rest of the circuit such as shunt<br>
and/or series power quenching elements, must be arranged so they work in<br>
conjunction with said diodes. Furthermore, the quenching element can also be<br>
provided with loads to adequately dissipate energy generated within the cable<br>
system. Lastly, the monitoring system may also be tuned to provide the least<br>
influence and/or the greatest energy absorption.<br>
Figure 21 illustrates an electrical circuit which achieves the above<br>
requirements. The electrical circuit is similar to that shown in Figure 20, but<br>
protection diodes are placed around the circuit, and optional systems for cable power<br>
dumping are provided, comprising Tl either in shunt and/or in series, on one or both<br>
rails. Of course, for the shunt method, the power supply must be protected from the<br>
shunt and this can be achieved in any of the known ways, including simultaneous<br>
series isolation or current limiting.<br>
Figure 22 illustrates a possible monitoring means for use with the above<br>
described circuits, which monitors the mutual inductor windings. Two window<br>
comparators are utilised so the output signals from the coils can be unison, positive,<br>
negative or opposed, depending on the fault type and position. When a fault is<br>
detected, the comparators will act to isolate the power supply from the rest of the<br>
electrical circuit<br>
Figure 23 illustrates how the above described electrical circuits can be<br>
provided with redundancy for added integrity. In the circuit shown in Figure 23 two<br>
power supplies 70 with load share option 73, feed discrete monitoring and control<br>
 <br>
means 74 with optional alarm annunciation, and two separate cable systems.<br>
Further discreet monitoring and control means 75 are provided at the load end of the<br>
cable, and are diode coupled, as shown at 72, to feed a common load or additional<br>
power converters 71.<br>
Should a higher integrity load or power converter be required, then it can be<br>
made autonomous. Figure 24 shows such an electrical circuit where the outputs can<br>
be used independently or, of course, diode coupled.<br>
Figure 25, illustrates an electrical circuit with an alternative means for<br>
distributing AC power, and is different to the circuit shown in Figure 19 in that the<br>
power transmit and receive coils are single windings, with a possible centre tap for<br>
ground fault detection. The power transmitting transformer Tl comprises intrinsically<br>
safe segregation, and may comprise further intrinsically safe or non-intrinsically safe<br>
windings, for use in powering other circuits, for example the monitoring circuit. The<br>
power receiving transformer Tn also comprises intrinsically safe segregation, and<br>
may comprise further intrinsically safe or non-intrinsically safe windings, for use in<br>
powering other circuits, for example any associated non-intrinsically safe circuits.<br>
As referred to above, cable breaks within multi-core cables are not considered<br>
to be instantaneous, and the idea that two arcs could develop simultaneously is<br>
never considered to be a possibility. It is however quite possible that one line could<br>
break or be disconnected, and with that one line already broken or disconnected a<br>
second could break or become disconnected. Figures 26 and 27 show electrical<br>
circuits in which this occurs.<br>
In Figure 26 an electrical circuit comprises a cable 10 with a load Rmax. The<br>
load Rmax is at an optimally high resistance so as not to provide a significant<br>
interruption reading, but is at an optimally low resistance within the normal incendive<br>
region at a given source voltage. The cable 10 has a resistance Rcabel, which may<br>
include any other upstream component resistance provided it is adequately<br>
 <br>
balanced. A first break 2 in the cable, or a break with a propagating arc 3, shunts<br>
current l[+aj away from the interrupted line to the uninterrupted line, such that the<br>
current l[+bj increases. This prevents incendive current and/or incendive voltage<br>
through and/or across the arc, but it also increases the current in the uninterrupted<br>
line, rendering it potentially more dangerous were it to be subsequently broken.<br>
However, as described above, the differential change in the lines will be detected and<br>
the power supply will be isolated to both lines, solving the problem,<br>
In Figure 27 a separation Cbreak has occurred in one of the lines of an<br>
electrical circuit and the full current is now carried by the remaining line. It is quite<br>
possible that a line could gradually reach this state wfthout detection, by corrosion or<br>
a similar effect However, from this point on a break 2 in the remaining line, with an<br>
arc 3 and a maximum resistance Rmax at a point of incendivity, would be detected by<br>
the above described monitoring and control means, and dealt with accordingly.<br>
Alternatively, the circuit could be arranged to measure the difference of current<br>
flowing between the two lines, for example with a bridge device. This would be more<br>
sensitive to any difference between the lines and wouid not be effected by high line<br>
currents.<br>
In reality, a slow increase in resistance, within one line in the cable, must pass<br>
from a normal core resistance, to a high resistance or to an open circuit Whilst<br>
passing, it would be likely, if this scenario is considered as likely, that it passes<br>
through a matched resistance which could generate heat that could be incendive. For<br>
example, a fifteen volt FISCO power supply may feed a cable that has a resistive<br>
transitional fault as described above, and if a short circuit is applied to the cable end<br>
the resistance could eight seven ohms. furthermore, the load Rmax and should comprise a-<br>
one hundred and eighty seven ohms. Furthermore, the load Rmax should comprise a<br>
minimum resistance so that the voltage across point A1-A2 is maintained.<br>
Alternatively the load Rmax resistance should be adequately increased if the voltage<br>
across A1-A2 falls. However, if Cbreak occurred the monitoring and control means<br>
would have reacted to it and Isolated the power supply.<br>
 <br>
Figure 28 illustrates two alternative advantageous circuit arrangements using<br>
any of the above described arrangements. Figure 28 snows how an electrical circuit<br>
can utilise one cable to supply more than one load and fault system 75a to 75n,<br>
taking power from one power supply 70 with one discrete fault detection 74, or how it<br>
can utilise more than one cable to supply the same components. Of course, the one<br>
power supply 70 with one discrete fault detection 74 may be made redundant. This<br>
example illustrates how one power source can be used to supply many loads in a<br>
'star' and/or 'bus' topology, with the option to 'multi-drop' several load systems using<br>
cable interconnections.<br>
As referred to above, any of the above circuits can comprise one or more<br>
duplications to satisfy EN50020.<br>
In addition, the load points A1-A2 can comprise any circuit, for example an<br>
encapsulated system [Ex e] or one which is further energy limited [Ex i]. The load may<br>
also comprise capacftive and/or inductive and/or constant current and/or resistive<br>
characteristics, or any other complex characteristics, provided they do not iead to an<br>
incendive situation. As such, adequate protection methods for each option must be<br>
provided. It may of course be adequate to rely on blocking diodes to provide this<br>
protection. Further intrinsically safe isolation may also be provided at the load to<br>
accommodate non-intrinsically safe circuits and so on.<br>
For higher power circuits, it is possible to implement a hybrid solution<br>
comprising protected cable media which prevent crossing faults, so only break/make<br>
faults or arcs need by accounted for, which are easier to detect This allows<br>
connectors to be without conceming incedive connection/disconnection<br>
The above described embodiments can be altered without departing from the<br>
scope of Claim 0. In particular, in one alternative construction, {not shown) an<br>
electrical circuit has a monitoring means comprising a power supply current<br>
monitoring component sited in the common negative or common positive line, and a<br>
 <br>
further current monitoring component in one of the two negative lines and in one of<br>
the two positive lines. In this arrangement the monitoring is performed with a three<br>
component system in place of four. The current in one line of a balanced system will<br>
be one half of the power supply current, and any deviation from this ratio can be<br>
discerned, and will be indicative of a cable fault or propagating arc Any load variation<br>
will still result in a discemable balanced ratio, and can be ignored.<br>
