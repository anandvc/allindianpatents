				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to the field of communication devices having the features like camera etc. and the need-based disabling of those features. Further, the invention relates to the portable devices like mobile phone capable of running applications for the need-based disabling of device features such as Messaging, Voice recording, incoming / outgoing calls, Mute ringer etc. also is possible according to the invention and the disabling will be invoked if and when the situation demands. More particularly, this invention encompasses a method for the need-based disabling of the features in a mobile.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
Mobile phones fitted with features like camera and voice recording is an attraction in the present communication world. But there are many institutions, organizations, high-tech industries, Art galleries, monuments etc. in which the concerned authorities do not let devices like camera/camcorder featured phones in their premises due to heightened information security policies and other threat perceptions. If the visitor is found to have a phone with Camera / Camcorder features, he/she is asked to deposit it at the front desk, before proceeding further into the premises. This security measures cause greater inconvenience to the users of such mobile phones even tempting them not to carry the mobile phone with camera/camcorder while visiting those places. The above circumstances restrict the user the freedom to use his equipment for other normal functions, which he can, legitimately use inside the premise. It is like advancement in technology defeating the basic purpose of communication needs. Also the security has the additional burden to take care of the user's equipment. This context is represented in Fig 1.<br>
Based on the foregoing the applicant finds the necessity for providing a method for the need-based disabling of features like camera/camcorder in the mobile. Consequently the applicant evolves a strategy wherein a reliable and simple<br><br>
mechanism is introduced by which camera or any other device on an equipment that can be a security threat, be disabled by the institution which does not allow users to have them in their premises when consented by the user.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is therefore the primary object of the invention to provide a method for disabling the camera/camcorder feature in a mobile phone entering the premises of a place where photography/video is prohibited. Disabling of other features like Messaging, Voice recording, incoming/outgoing calls, Mute ringer etc. also is possible according to the invention and the disabling will be invoked if and when the situation demands.<br>
It is another object of the invention to allow the disabling of the camera/camcorder feature in the mobile by the authority responsible for it with the consent of the phone user.<br>
It is yet another object of the invention to maintain a web server either by the disabling authority or by the mobile service provider for facilitating the disabling of camera/camcorder feature.<br>
It is also an object of the invention to seek the permission of the mobile user through an application run on the handset before disabling the feature.<br>
Accordingly the invention provides a method for the need based disabling of the<br>
features in a mobile, the method comprising:<br>
a) establishing a connection with the application running on the mobile phone (initiated by the application), when the disabling authority logs on to the said secure website of the service provider using an Id and password<br><br>
and requests the disabling of a feature from mobile phone;<br>
b)	sending a request containing the information like the address of the site, a random number that serves as the request id and the request code to the mobile phone in order to disable it;<br>
c)	prompting the user to either accept or deny the request to disable the device; and<br>
d)	disabling the mobile phone on receiving the permission from the user, displaying it prominently on the mobile phone and sending a confirmation message to the disabling authority along with a random number generated, which serves as the enabling password.<br>
The proposed invention also provides a method for enabling the features already disabled, the method comprising the steps of,<br>
a)	sending a message to the disabling authority if and when the user requests the network to enable the disabled feature; and<br>
b)	enabling the feature after receiving a confirmation message for enabling the feature from the disabling authority or on expiry of a stipulated time when the disabling authority fails to respond.<br>
The invention further provides an alternate method for enabling the features already disabled, the method comprising the steps of,<br>
a)	prompting the user to key in the password generated while disabling the mobile, when he/she tries to access the disabled feature of the mobile phone; and<br>
b)	checking whether the entered password matches the password generated by the mobile while disabling the device and hence enabling it again if the password is correct.<br>
These and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become more readily apparent from a reading of the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the drawings.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings. It should be understood however that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention, which may be embodied in various forms. The following description and drawings are not to be construed as limiting the invention and numerous specific details are described to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention, as the basis for the claims and as a basis for teaching one skilled in the art how to make and/or use the invention. However in certain instances, well-known or conventional details are not described in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention in detail.<br>
According to the invention there are two different approaches for the implementation of the system. According to the first approach the Institution<br><br>
maintains a web server to which the user is asked to connect. Here a small applet is downloaded to the phone over the air and the handsets provide APIs to disable/enable the device feature.<br>
However the second method is preferred wherein the service provider maintains a web server and the disabling authority registers with the web site for dynamic disabling of features. The system according to the preferred embodiment of the invention is represented in Fig 2. In order to disable the feature as per this method, the disabling authority has to log on to the secure website of the service provider and enter the phone number of the mobile user. In turn the application run on the user's mobile phone connects him to the website and confirms the request to disable his phone's feature for example camera feature, sent by the disabling authority. As a result the device feature on the phone is disabled and the respective information is prominently displayed on the user's handset. Subsequently the institution receives a^aotification stating that the feature on the phone is disabled along with the password to enable the feature. As a final step of the process the institution is asked to acknowledge the notification. The process of disabling the feature is explained in Fig 3.<br>
Once the camera/camcorder or any other feature in the mobile is displayed, there can be multiple ways to enable the feature on the phone. According to a preferred option the disabling authority can key in the password he has received while locking the phone and enable the feature. In the other method the disabling authority logs onto the service provider's website and enables the camera on the phone.<br>
The invention also provides flexibility for the user to request the enabling of the feature. In this case the server verifies if the camera can be enabled when it receives the request for enabling the camera/camcorder feature. If it is locked by some authority, the server requests them to enable the camera. In case of confirmation or lack of response in stipulated time the feature is enabled again and the authority, which disabled the feature, is notified if possible. This is illustrated in Fig 4. Fig 5 represents the communications between the functional parts for the<br><br>
process of enabling/disabling.<br>
The main components of the invention are mobile station and web server to equip the two parties involved, viz. disabling authority and the mobile user for the process. A secure server maintained by the service provider can let disabling authorities to login and manage the devices locked by them. A small application running on the mobile helps to connect it to the web server, enable/disable a feature (s) appropriately; and help the user to enable the feature(s) while the user tries to access a disabled feature.<br>
The downloaded applet, which runs in the mobile, has the following functions:<br>
1.	To establish a reliable and secure connection with the server so that the<br>
server knows that it is communicating with its counterpart only. It involves the<br>
following<br>
{<br>
Connect to server using an authentication mechanism and in a secure way<br>
Open communication channel so that it can receive commands from the server and<br>
Communicate back in a secure way.<br>
}<br>
2.	Request Handset for specific actions like enabling/disabling a device<br>
3.	Return status of the request to the server and any additional parameters generated by the handset for the Server.<br>
4.	Request server for any specific action like user initiated enabling of the device feature.<br>
It is to be understood that the applet itself does not do the disabling or enabling, but requests the handset to do so. Applet only has the function of calling the APIs<br><br>
provided by the handset with the required information. In order to help the implementation, the applet does the following:<br>
1.	Pass on to handset s/w required information about the Server to identify itself<br>
2.	If the identification is accepted convey that information to the server.<br>
3.	Disable the device feature or Enable the device feature based on request from the server. These are APIs provided by the handset and have the parameters, (list of features to be disabled, call_back_function). Here Call_back_function in the applet gets invoked once the phone executes this function and in turn the applet informs the server of the status of the operation and supplies any generated parameters.<br>
Handset software is responsible for all the user interface and letting the user know of the phone's device locked/unlocked status. Handset can elect to<br>
1.	Display the disabling authority information in an appropriate way.<br>
2.	Take feedback from the user on whether to proceed or not<br>
3.	Convey that information to the applet which in turn will take it to the server<br>
4.	Act on the request by the applet to disable/enable the feature<br>
5.	Give the feed back to the applet on the operation which may in turn go to the server<br>
The functioning of the applet is as follows:<br>
The applet gets a status message from the disable function in the phone and a random number that the phone has generated. The applet passes on this information to the server and in turn receives the Identification information of the server, requisition ID and a request code. Here Identification information is information for the user about the identity of the disabling authority, Requisition ID is a tracking number generated by the server so that it can track each of the requests, which it has made and Request code is the actual command by the server to the applet to do what. The disabling authority can view this information viz., status of the disabling operation and the random number generated by the phone.<br><br>
A sample data describing request code and action is given below.<br>
E.g.<br>
Req code	Action<br>
1.	Disable Camera<br>
2.	Enable Camera<br>
3.	Disable Messaging<br>
4.	Enable Messaging<br>
5.	Disable Voice recording<br>
6.	Enable Voice recording<br>
7.	Disable Call<br>
8.	Enable Call<br>
9.	Mute Ringer<br>
10.	Enable ringer<br>
11.	Disable any other/ a set of features above<br>
12.	Enable any other / a set of features above<br>
It is to be noted herein that the user has the provision on the phone to enable any of the disabled features at any time. If the user invokes this facility provided by the handset, then the handset will request the resident applet to request the server to enable the device feature<br><br>
Steps for performing the invention is described in detail below:<br>
1.	Disabling authority logs on to the secure website of service provider using an Id and Password and requests the disabling of a feature from Phone X.<br>
2.	The application on Phone X establishes a connection with the web server.<br><br>
The server sends a request to Phone X to disable the device. The request contains information like the address of the site, a random number that serves as the request id and the request code.<br>
3.	The user is asked to either accept or deny the request to disable the device.<br>
4.	On Accept, the mobile disables the device, displays it prominently on the phone and sends a confirmation message to the requester's address along with a random number generated. The website forwards this information to the disabling authority.<br>
5.	The next time user tries to access his camera/disabled device, he is prompted to either key in the generated password or requests the network to enable it.<br>
6.	If the entered password matches the password generated by the mobile while disabling the device, the device is enabled again.<br>
7.	If the user requests the network to enable, a message is sent to the authority (Disabling authority), which requested the disabling of the feature. If the disabling authority confirms the request or fails to respond in a stipulated time, mobile-based application is asked to enable the feature. In case of a reject from disabling authority, the device is not enabled and user is notified.<br>
8.	Whenever the device is locked by another authority or enabled, the information that the phone is no longer locked, is notified to the authority, which previously locked it successfully, at the first available opportunity.<br>
The invention described herein assumes that the phone is WAP enabled (capability to connect to the internet) and the disabling authority has access to Internet. It is further assumed that the premises where the features is not permitted are mutually exclusive and the service provider or the vendor maintains the server for the purpose of the invention. However the above feature is not limited to the features like Messaging, Voice recording, incoming/outgoing calls, Mute ringer etc. also is possible according to the invention and the disabling will be invoked if and when the situation demands.<br><br>
The foregoing description of a preferred embodiment of the invention has been presented for purposes of illustration and description. It is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise form disclosed. Obvious modifications or variations are possible in the light of the above teachings.<br>
While the foregoing description assumed a particular architecture it will be appreciated that the present invention may be used in numerous architectures and in numerous other examples. Although the invention has been described in detail with reference to specific embodiments thereof, it would be apparent to those skilled in the art that various changes and modifications may be made therein without departing from the spirit of the invention, the scope of which is defined in the attached claims.<br><br><br><br>
