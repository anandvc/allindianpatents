FROZEN LACTIC ACID BACTERIAL CULTURE OF INDIVIDUAL<br>
PELLETS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION;<br>
The present invention relates to a pellet-frozen lactic acid bacteria (LAB) culture in a commercially relevant package that has a weight of at least 50 g frozen material wherein the frozen material is present in the form of individual pellets characterized by the fact that when stored at a temperature below the initial melting temperature (Tm') of the culture, e.g, at -46°C, for 7-14 days the individual pellets of the frozen culture are not sticking together and therefore substantially remain as individual pellets.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION:<br>
Microorganisms are involved in the manufacture of food and feed products including most dairy products. Bacterial cultures, in particular cultures of bacteria that are generally classified as lactic acid bacteria, are essential in the making of all fermented milk products, cheese and butter. Cultures of such bacteria may be referred to as starter cultures and they impart specific features to various daiiy products by performing a number of functions.<br>
Dairy starter cultures are generally composed of lactic acid bacteria. In the present context, the expression "lactic acid bacteria" (LAB) designates a group of Gram positive, catalase negative, non-motile, non-sporulating, microaerophilic or anaerobic bacteria which ferment sugars with the production of organic acids, including lactic acid as the predominantly produced acid, formic acid and propionic acid. In the present context lactic acid bacteria comprise of a number of bacterial genera within the phylum Firmicutes. The genera Carnobacteriwn^ Enterococcus, Lactobacittus, Lactococcus, Lactosphaera, Leuconostoc, Melissococcus, Oenococcus, Pedio-coccus, Streptococcus, Tetragenococcus, Vagococcus and Weissella are recognized as LAB. Also lactic acid-producing Gram-positive bacteria belonging to the phylum Actmobacteria such as the genera Aerococcus, Microbacterium and Propionibacterium as well as Bifidobac-terium are in the present context considered as LAB. The industrially most useful lacoc acid bacteria are found among Lactococcus species, Streptococcus species, Enterococcus species^ Lactobadllus species, Leuconostoc species, Bifidobacteruan species and Pediococcus species.<br><br>
In addition to the their use in the dairy industry lactic acid bacteria cultures also find widely use in the meat processing industry as well as a number of other industries.<br>
Commercial starter cultures may be distributed as frozen cultures. Highly concentrated frozen cultures are commercially very interesting since such cultures can be inoculated directly into the fermentation medium (e.g. milk or meat) without intermediate transfer. In others words, such highly concentrated frozen cultures comprise bacteria in an amount that makes in-house bulk starter cultures at the end-users superfluous. A '*bulk starter" is defined herein as a starter culture propagated at the food processing plant for inoculation into the fermentation medium. Highly concentrated cultures may be referred to as direct vat set (DVS)-cultures. In order to comprise sufficient bacteria to be used as a DVS-culture at the end-users, a concentrated frozen culture generally has to have a weight of at least 50 g and a content of viable bacteria of at least 109 colony forming units (CFU) per g.<br>
An important issue in the practical use of frozen cultures is the convenience of the actual handling of the cultures. Whereas cultures frozen "en block" are difficult to handle it has been found that cultures frozen in pellets are very easy to handle both for the producer and the consumer.<br>
Consequently, a thriving market for highly concentrated pellet frozen cultures - so-called frozen direct vat set (F-DVS)-cultures - has formed.<br>
A number of publications concerned with the viability of frozen cultures have occurred.<br>
Chavarri et al. (1988) describes that the viability of a frozen pure Streptococcus lactis culture can be improved by addition of 5% lactose or 5% sucrose.<br>
Carcoba et aL (2000) describes that the viability of a frozen piire Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis culture can be improved by addition of differed cryaprotective agents such as sugars (lactose, sucrose and trehalose). <br><br>
US 4.140.800 (Kline), describes that the viability of freeze-dried cultures can be improved by addition of different cryoprotective agents. Also the viability of frozen cultures added lactose, sucrose or maltose are discussed.<br>
WO00/39281 (Kringelum et. al.) describes that the viability of anon-frozen, liquid starter culture can be improved by addition of different cryoprotective agents, and<br>
WO 2004/065584 Al (Bisgaard-Frantzen) describes that the viability of a highly concentrated frozen starter culture can be improved by addition of different cryoprotective agents.<br>
Only WO 2004/065584 Al describes pellet-frozen cultures and none of the above-mentioned publications refer to the physical stability of the pellet-frozen cultures during storage.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION:<br>
Commercially, a pellet-frozen lactic acid bacteria (LAB) culture is normally provided in a suitable package (e.g. in a 2 L tetra pack of carton). It is normally stored at a storage temperature of around -46°C and the frozen material is present in the form of individual pellets of a relatively small weight.<br>
Prior to the present invention, the present inventors believed that there were no significant problems with respect to storage of such commercial relevant pellet-frozen lactic acid bacteria (LAB) cultures.<br>
However, based on different studies the present inventors identified that when a number of commercially relevant cultures where stored approximately at -46°C for 7 days or longer the individual pellets were sticking together and making larger clumps. In the industrial setting the clumping create handling problems. It is e.g. significantly more difficult to administer an adequate dose from the culture package when the culture is clumped. It may even be difficult m get the clumped culture out of the package in a convenient way.<br><br>
Further studies identified that the "problematic" cultures could be characterized by having a Tm* value (onset of ice melting, as defined by Roos (1995)) of the pellet-frozen lactic acid bacteria (LAB) culture below the storage temperature of approximately -46°C. The Tm' value is a standard physical chemistry torn used in the food industry and elsewhere. Tm' is routinely measured by Differential Scanning Caloriometry (DSC) techniques as described by Roos (1991). It relates to the onset temperature of melting of the food product (here the frozen LAB culture). For further details reference are made to the textbooks "Food Chemistry" Fen-nema (1996) and "Phase Transition in Foods" Roos (1995).<br>
Without being limited to theory, it is believed that when a frozen culture has a Tm' value below its storage temperature 5 e.g. approximately -46°C, an initial phase transition (melting) occur and cause the individual pellets to stick together and form larger clumps.<br>
In summary, the work of the present inventors has identified hitherto unrecognized storage problems in relation to the physical appearance of some types of commercially relevant tidily concentrated pellet-frozen lactic acid bacteria cultures. Once having identified this problem, the present inventors could start to trying solve the problem.<br>
Independent of any possible theoretical explanation, the present inventors identified that by adding certain relevant additive compounds to a problematic pellet-frozen culture, one could obtain a pellet-frozen culture, which after 7 to 14 days of storage at -46°C did not form clumps of individual pellets. Such cultures were characterized by that the individual pellets of the frozen culture were not sticking together and therefore substantially remain as individual pellets even after prolonged storage at approximately-46°C<br>
Overall, the relevant additive compounds may be characterized by that they are able to increase the Tm' value, of the frozen culture, to a value above the storage temperature, e.g. -46°C, such as for instance to raise the Tm' value from range -70 to -46°C to the range from -45 to -15°C.<br>
The working examples herein describe preferred examples of suitable additive compounds. Described compounds include trehalose, maltodextrin, cyclodextrin, spray gum, fish gelatin bloom and maltitol. Based on common general knowledge the skilled person is perfectly capa-<br><br>
ble of identifying further relevant additive compounds that are able to increase the Tm' value, of a frozen culture, to a value above the storage temperature, e.g. -46°C.<br>
As said above, in order to comprise sufficient bacteria a commercially relevant highly concentrated frozen culture generally has a weight of at least 50 g and a content of viable bacteria of at least 109 colony forming units (CFU) per g. The cultures described in the articles of Cha-varri (1988) and Carcoba (2000) are not directed to the physical stability of pellet-frozen cultures, but raiher to the viability of the frozen bacteria in the present context not considered commercially relevant highly concentrated frozen cultures since they are made on much smaller scale and comprise significantly less grams of frozen culture, and moreover the described cultures are not pellet-frozen cultures. Also, the cultures described by Chavarri (1988) and Carcoba (2000) are not directed to the physical stability of pellet-frozen cultures al all, but rather to the viability of the frozen bacteria.<br>
Axxxardingly. a first aspect of the invention relates to a pellet-frozen lactic acid bacteria (LAB) culture in a commercially relevant package that has a weight of at least 50 g frozen material, wherein the frozen material is present in the form of individual pellets, having a content of viable bacteria of at least 109 colony forming units (CFU) per g frozen material and comprising from 0.5% to 13% of an additive compound measured as w/w of the frozen material.<br>
The additive compound is selected from the group of compounds that, by using an amount of 10% of the additive compound measured as w/w of the frozen material, are able to increase the Tm' (onset temperature of ice melting) of the frozen lactic acid bacteria (LAB) culture, which without the additive compound has a Tm' value from -70°C to -46°C, to a Tm' value from -45 to -15°C (measured by DSC).<br>
Furthermore, the frozen lactic acid bacteria (LAB) culture is characterized by that when stored at approximately -46°C for 7-14 days the individual pellets of the frozen culture are not sticking together and therefore substantially remain as individual pellets where this is measured by following test:<br>
the individual pellets of the frozen culture are pellet frozen in liquid nitrogen and 100 individual pellets (around 5 - 100 g of pellets) are poured into a petridish, thus forming a thin layer of loose, individual single pellets, the layer being characterized in that the majority of the pellets are in physical contact with one or more of its neighbor pellets, placed at approximately -46°C for 7-14 days and examined to see if the pellets are still<br><br>
loose or if the pellets had made clumps or are sticking together, wherein the criteria for the individual pellets of the frozen culture substantially remaining as individual pellets axe that at least 80 of the 100 individual pellets remain as loose individual single pellets.<br>
However, frozen lactic acid bacteria (LAB) cultures that comprise LAB that are that are able to utilize sucrose and wherein the culture comprises a cryoprotective agent compound selected from the group consisting of sucrose in an amount from 2 % to 13% of sucrose measured as w/w of the frozen material; and trehalose in an amount from 4 % to 6 % of trehalose measured as w/w of the frozen material; and a trehalose/sucrose mixture both in the amount of from 12% to 14 % measured as w/w of the frozen material, are specifically exempted from the first aspect of this invention.<br>
The "disclaimer" described at the end of the first aspect relates to the PCT application WO 2004/065584 AL This application was filed 19 of January 2004. At the filing date of the priority forming application of the present application the PCT application WO 2004/065584 Al was not published.<br>
WO 2004/065584 Al relates to improving the viability during storage of a frozen culture. It does not describe the "pellet sticking" problem of the present invention. The general, main claim 1 relates to "a frozen lactic acid bacteria (LAB) culture that comprises LAB that are able to utilize sucrose, has a weight of at least 50 g frozen material and a content of viable bacteria of at least 109 colony forming units (CFU) per g frozen material, characterized in that the frozen culture comprises from 0.5% to 80% of a cryoprotective agent measured as w/w of the frozen material."<br>
Although pellet-frozen cultures with cryoprotective agents are described in WO 2004/065584 Al , it can be excluded that a skilled person would inevitably arrive at a result falling within the terms of WO 2004/065584 Al since WO 2004/065584 Al specifically only claims cultures that are able to utilize sucrose.<br>
With respect to the frozen culture of the present invecatrion, the additive compound should preferably be added to the viable bacteria before mey are frozen<br><br>
Accordingly, in a second aspect the invention relates to a method for making a pellet-frozen lactic acid bacteria (LAB) culture of the first aspect of the invention and embodiments as described herein, comprising following steps:<br>
(i)       adding an additive compound to viable bacteria to get at least 50 g of material with a content of viable bacteria of at least 109 colony forming units (CFU) per g material and comprising the additive compound in an amount from 0.5% to 13% measured as w/w of the material,<br>
ii)      freezing the material to get pellet-frozen material, and (iii)     packing the frozen material in a suitable way to get a packed pellet-frozen lactic<br>
acid bacteria (LAB) culture of the first aspect of the invention and embodiments as described herein.<br>
A third aspect of the invention relates to a pellet-frozen lactic acid bacteria (LAB) culture obtainable by the method for making a pellet-frozen lactic acid bacteria (LAB) culture of the second aspects of the invention.<br>
A fourth aspect of the invention relates to use of the pellet-frozen lactic acid bacteria (LAB) culture as described above in a process for making a food or feed product.<br>
DEFINITIONS:<br>
Prior to a discussion of the detailed embodiments of the invention a definition of specific teams related to the main aspects of the invention is provided.<br>
The term "LAB that are able to utilize sucrose" denotes LAB that are able to ferment the sugar sucrose with the production of acids. This is the same definition as in PCT publication number WO 2004/065584 Al.<br>
The term "material" of the culture denotes the relevant substances of the culture includins bodi the viable bacteria and cryoprotective agent Possible packing is not included. Consequeet^y. the weight of the material of the culture is not including the weight of possible packing.<br><br>
The term "packing" or "package" should be understood broadly. It denotes that the pellet-frozen lactic acid bacteria (LAB) culture should be packed in order to be provided to the user. It may be packed in a bottle, a tetra-pack© container, etc.<br>
The term "an additive compound" may in the present context be a single specific additive compound or it may be two or more different additive compounds. Accordingly, the w/w percentage of the additive compound(s) within the culture material should be understood as the sum of the amount of additive compound(s). Preferably, the term relates to a compound that is added to the culture after fermentation. Accordingly, it may be a compound that is not present in a significant amount in the culture fermentation broth as such.<br>
The terms "pellet-frozen" and "pellet-frozen culture" refer to a culture frozen by use of a method which results in pellets or granula of the frozen culture. A pellet-frozen culture may conveniently be made by adding the culture dropwise into liquid N? forming frozen pellets or granula of the culture. Typically, but not necessarily, the process is performed on trays in a conventional industrial freeze-drying plant<br>
The term "pellets" or "granula" refers to small solid entities formed by frozen liquid of an average size between 0,1 and 10 ram.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION:<br>
Tm9 value<br>
As explained above, the Tm' value is a standard known term in physical chemistry describing the temperature at which the onset of ice melting occurs. In the present context Tm* denotes the temperature at which the onset melting of a frozen LAB culture occurs.<br>
Preferably, the Tm' value is measured by use of the DSC protocol described in the section named 'Measurement of Tm" of working example 1 herein.<br>
Pellet clumping test<br>
As explained with respect to the first aspect of the invention the test to analyze if the pellet-frozen lactic acid bacteria (LAB) culture is a culture that may be characterized by that when stored at approximately -46°C (in the present situation a freezer preset to -50°C had an sample tempereture of -46°C) for 7-14 days the individual pellets of the frozen culture are not stick-bag together and therefore substantially remain as individual pellets in a test comprising following:<br>
The individual pellets of the frozen culture are pellet frozen in liquid nitrogen and 100 individual pellets (around 5 - 100 g of pellets) are poured into a petridish, thus forming a thin layer of loose individual single pellets, the layer being characterized in that the majority of the pellets are in physically contact with one or more of its neighbor pellets, placed at approximately -46°C for 7-14 days and examined to see if the pellets are stiH loose or if the pellets had made chimps or are sticking together, wherein the criteria for that the individual pellets of the frezen culture substantially remain as individual pellets are that at least 80 of the 100 individual pellets remain as loose individual single pellets. More preferably at least 90 of the 100 to dividual pellets remain as loose individual single pellets and even more preferably &amp; Less: 95 of the 100 individual pellets remain as loose individual single pellets.<br><br>
Examining and counting individual pellets that remain as loose individual single pellets may be done visually. It is within the skilled person capacity to do this in a consistent way where the results would, within normal limited technical uncertainty, be consistent and repeatable. Working example 1 herein provides further technical details.<br>
A pellet-frozen lactic acid bacteria (LAB) culture<br>
Preferably, the team "a frozen lactic acid bacteria (LAB) culture" denotes herein a culture which without comprising the added additive compound as described herein has a Tm' value of from -70 to -46°C. The culture maybe frozen in the form of pellets or granula, forming a "a pellet-frozen lactic acid bacteria (LAB) culture". A pellet-frozen lactic acid bacteria (LAB) culture may conveniently be made by adding the culture dropwise into liquid N2 forming frozen pellets or granula of the culture.<br>
The LAB of the culture may be any in particular commercial relevant LAB that do not utilize sucrose according to International IDF Standard 146AJ1998 'Identification of Characteristic Microorganisms" by use of apropriate API test kits (bioMerissm SA, Lyon, France). API kit "rapid ID 32 STREP" and "50 CHL Medium" is used to establish the sucrose utilization status for most LAB genera.<br>
Preferably, the LAB is a LAB selected from the group comprising Bifidobacteriurn spp., Bre-vibacterium spp., Propionibacterium spp., Lactococcus spp. including Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis and Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris, Lactobacillus spp. including Lactobacil-lus acidophilus, Streptococcus spp., Enterococcus spp., Pediococcus spp., Leuconostoc spp., Oenococcus spp, and fungal spp. including Pencillium spp., Cryptococcus spp., Debraryomy-ces spp., Klyveromyces spp. and Saccharomyces spp.<br>
Even though some of these species in general are described as capable ofntitizmg sucrose mutants that are not able to utilize sucrose, have been, asd will continuously be isolated. No matter how such mutations are isolated or obtained, they are still an aspect of the present invention.<br><br>
The industrially most useful lactic acid bacteria are found among Lactococcus species, Streptococcus species, Enterococcus species, Lactobacilhis species, Leuconostoc species and Pediococcus species.<br>
The term "mixed lactic acid bacteria (LAB) culture" denotes a mixed culture that comprises two or more different LAB species. The term a "pure lactic acid bacteria (LAB) culture" denotes a pure culture that comprises only a single LAB species specie.<br>
The culture as described herein may be a mesophilic culture consisting of mesophilic bacteria having aptimum growth temperatures at about 30°C. A "a mesophilic culture" is a culture fhat comprises two or more different mesophilic LAB species.<br>
Typical organisms belonging to the mesophilic group include Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris, Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. cremoris, Pediococcus pentosaceus, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis biovar. diacetylactis and Lactobadllus casei subsp. casei. Thermophilic lactic acid bacterial species include as examples Streptococcus theimophilus, Enterococcus faedum, Lactobadllus lactis, Lactobadllus helveticus, Lactoba-dllus delbrueckti subsp. bulgaricus and Lactobadllus addophilus.<br>
The culture as described herein may comprise LAB that are not able to utilize sucrose. An so-called O-culture is used to make cheese without holes (Cheddar, Cheshire, Feta) and typically comprises one or more organisms selected from the group comprising Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis and Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris. In general O-cultures are considered not to utilize sucrose.<br>
Highly concentrated pellet-frozen lactic acid bacteria cultures<br>
The frozen cultures as described herein are what in the food industry may be termed highly concentrated pellet-frozen lactic acid bacteria cultures. In order to comprise sufficient bacteria, such cultures should be relatively big (have a sufficient weight) combined with a relatively high concentration of viable bacteria. It is obvious that if relatively more bacteria is required, the weight and/or the concentration of viable bacteria should be increased.<br><br>
Preferably, a pellet-frozen lactic acid bacteria (LAB) culture as described herein has a weight of at least 100 g frozen material, more preferably a weight of at least 250 g frozen material, even more preferably a weight of at least 500 g frozen material and most preferably a weight of at least 900 g frozen material. Preferably, the weight of the frozen material is less than 500 kg.<br>
Preferably, a pellet-frozen lactic acid bacteria (LAB) culture as described herein has a content of viable bacteria of at least 5x109 colony forming units (CFU) per g frozen material, more preferably a content of viable bacteria of at least 1010 colony forming units (CFU) per g frozen material, and most preferably a content of viable bacteria of at least 2x1010 colony forming units (CFU) per g frozen material.<br>
Fermentation and suitable fermentation media for LAB are known in the art and the skilled person is capable of selecting a suitable media and fermentation conditions in relation to the specific LAB. Suitable media and fermentations are given in the working example section herein.<br>
In order to get sufficient amount of bacteria, it is in the present context preferred to make a relatively large-scale fermentation in suitable big fermentation tanks. Fermentation tanlrs of at least 50 L, preferably at least 90 L, even more preferably 500 L or bigger are preferred.<br>
After a suitable fermentation, the viable bacteria are preferably isolated by removal of the liquid (supernatant) of the fermentation media (e.g. by centrifiigation). The isolated viable bacteria may be termed the isolated biomass. The isolated viable bacteria shall preferably have a content of viable bacteria of at least 109 colony forming units (CFU) per g frozen material, more preferably a content of at least 5x109 CFU pa* g frozen material, and most preferably a content of at least 1010 CFU per g frozen material.<br>
After addition of the additive compound (see below) to the concentrated culture. The culture may conveniently be frozen by adding the mixture dropwise into liquid N2 forming frozen pellets or granula of the mixture. A feasible method for the freezing process is described in DE2805676 and FR2393251.<br>
The pellet-frozen culture is then packaged a suitable way in order to be provided to the user.<br><br>
Additive compound<br>
As discussed above, preferably the relevant additive compounds are characterized by that they are able to increase the Tm' value, of the frozen culture, to a value above the storage temperature, e.g. -46°C, such as to a Tm' value from -45°C to -15°C, more preferably to a Tm' value from -43°C to -15°C and even more preferably to a Tm' value from -39°C to -15°C.<br>
Working example 2 herein illustrates a rapid experimental strategy to identify relevant additive compounds. To a "model" frozen culture with a Tm3 value below -46°C (in example 2 "model" culture has a Tm' value of-54°Q was added different relevant compounds (10% W/W) and the Tm' values before and after addition were measured by DSC.<br>

Finally, after the addition of the additive compound the culture is pellet-frozen and a pellet clumping test (see above) ensuring that at least 80 of the 100 individual pellets remain as loose, individual singie pellets, is performed.<br><br>
Use of the frozen lactic acid bacteria (LAB) culture<br>
A frozen lactic acid bacteria (LAB) culture as described herein may be used in a process for making a food or feed product according to the art.<br>
EXAMPLES:<br>
Example L:<br>
R604-E (a commercially available frozen O-culture, Chr. Hansen A/S, Denmark) tends to form sticky pellets during frozen storage. In the present study this problem is approached by taking a closer look at the melting temperature, and trying to increase it by adding caseinate, sucrose or maltodextrin.<br>
Aim:<br>
Tc evatuate if it is possible to raise the melting point of F-DYS of R604-E by using additives. The effect of using additives to increase the melting point of R604-E is evaluated:<br>
visually, and<br>
by measuring the Tm' by DSC for each of the tested formulations.<br>
i) Material:<br>
2 kilos of coromercially available culture, F-DVS R 604-E (Chr. Hansen A/S, Hoersholm, Denmark, Batch 2441258, material no. 616581).<br>
ii) Additives solution used for formulation to raise the melting point:<br>
50% (w/w) sucrose solution (Danisco, Denmark).<br>
10% (w/w) Na-cassinate solution (Aria, Denmark).<br>
30% (w/w) Malto Dextrin DE 10 solution (Glucidex 10, Roquette Freres, Lestrem, France).<br>
30°/e (w/w) Malto Dextrin DE 2 solution (Glucidex 2, Roquette Freres, Lestrem, France).<br><br>
iii) Recipe for formulation of F-DVS R604-E:<br>
The frozen concentrate was thawed and mixed with additives according to Table 1.<br><br>
Visual evaluation of melting point of F-DVS R604.<br>
The 6 formulations of F-DVS R-604 E were pellet-frozen in liquid nitrogen and 100 individual pellets (around 20 - 30 g) of pellets were poured into petridishes, thus forming a fh-m layer of loose, single pellets.<br>
One sample of each of the formulations was placed in a freezer preset to at -50°C? the actual temperature of the samples was -46°C. After 7 days of storage the samples were examined to see if they were still loose or if the pellets had made clumps or seemed sticky - and if so - their willingness to be shaken into loose particles again.<br><br>
- = Clump, caked or sticky, (less than 20 of the 100 individual pellets remain as loose individual single pellets)<br>
+ = Partly loose particles, (loss than 60 of the 100 individual pellets remain as loose individual single pellets)<br>
++- = Nearly loose particles, (at least 80 of the 100 individual pellets remain as loose individual single pellets)<br>
+++ = Loose particles (at least 90 of the 100 individual pellets remain as loose individual single pellets)<br>
Measurement of Tm':<br>
The samples were prepared in 100 /µL alumina crucibles and frozen in liquid nitrogen. One sample of each of the formulations and F-DVS R604 was placed for 6 days at -46°C.<br>
The phase transition was measured on a Mettler Toledo 822e Differential Scanning Calo-riometer (a DSC) with 100 µL alumina crucibles, temperature program, insert temp ~90°C? scanning temp, program: 5°C/min. -130°C - 0°C.<br><br>
The Tm' values (onset of ice melting, as defined by Roos (1995)) were measured. Results are shown in table 2.<br>
We observe that use of &gt;6% sucrose and 6% malto dextrin (2 or 10) increase the Tm' value of frozen pellets. It is not possible to see any effect of Na-caseinate. From the visual inspection 10% sucrose and the two different maltodextrin show positive effect against the tendency to make sticky pellets.<br>
Example 2:<br>
Aim<br>
To identify what kind of additives that could increase the melting point of frozen culture a screening study was made. The following additives were tested:<br>
Trehalose, Malto dextrin 12, cyclo dextrin, spray gum, PEG, Fish gelatin, maltitoL, Sodimn chloride, glycerol.<br>
i) Material:<br>
F-DVS R 604-E (Batch 2471755, material 616581) for details please see Examplel.<br>
ii) Additives solution used for formulation to raise the melting point:<br>
50% (w/w) trehalose.<br>
30% (w/w) Malto Dextrin DE 12 (Glucidex 12, Roquette Freres, Lestrem, France)..<br>
30% (w/w) cyclodextrin<br>
30% (w/w) Spray gum (IRX 51693 from CNT)<br>
30% (w/w) PEG (PEG 6000, Merck, Germany)<br>
30% (w/w) Fish gelatin bloom 200 (SKW Biosystems, France)<br>
30% (w/w) maltitol<br>
30% (w/w). Sodium Chloride<br>
30% (w/w) Glycerol<br><br>
iii) Recipe for formulation of F-DVS R604-E:<br>
The frozen F-DVS R604-E concentrate was thawed and mixed with the different additives to a final formulation of 10% (WAV).<br>
Measurement of Tm':<br>
The samples were prepared in 100 µL alumina crucibles and frozen in liquid nitrogen. The phase transition curves were recorded on the Mettler Toledo 822e Differential Scanning Calo-riometer for the 9 formulations and compared to the reference sample (R604E without additives). The samples were inserted to the DSC at -90°C and run using temperature program: insert temperature -90°C; temperature scanning 7°C /min from -130°C to 0°C.<br>
Result:<br>
The phase transition curves were made and the Tm' values determined as described by Roos (1991) the values are given in table 3 below;<br><br><br>
The Tm' for the reference sample is found to be -54°C (onset of ice melting). The following additives are increasing Tm5:<br><br>
Maltitol (-42°C), Trehalose (-38°C) Fish gelatin (-37°C) Maltodextrine 12 (-32°C) Spray gum (-31°C)<br>
Glycerol and sodium chloride did not increase the melting point of frozen culture pellets.<br>
Example 3:<br>
In this trial the intension was to evaluate the relationship between amount of additive and the increase in Tm' measured on DSC.<br>
i) Material:<br>
F-DVS CH N 19 (Batch 2421868) (commercially available frozmLD-cultures, Chr. Haasen A/S, Denmark).<br><br><br>
il) Additive solutions used for formulation to raise the melting point:<br>
The concentration of sucrose per gram biomass varied from 3% (w/w) up to 13% (w/w). Tre-haiose was only tested on a 5% (w/w) level. All sucrose concentrations were prepared from a 50% (w/w) sucrose solution added to the biomass. The trehalose concentration was prepared from a 40% (w/w) solution.<br>
Measurement of Tm'<br>
The frozen F-DVS R604-E concentrate was thawed and mixed with the different additives as indicated in table 4. Then samples were transferred to 100 (µL alumina crucibles and frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at —46°C before analyzed. The phase transition curves were recorded on the DSC for the 8 formulations and compared to the reference sample (R604E without additives). The samples were inserted into the DSC at -90°C and run using temperature program: insert temperature -90°C; temperature scanning: 5°C/min. -130°C - 0°C.<br>
From these phase transition curves the Tm\ The correlation between Tm' and amount of dis-accarides added can be seen in Figure 1.<br><br>
From Figure 1 it can be seen that 8% sucrose and more will ensure that the frozen culture do not start melting at -46°C storage.<br>
Example 4<br>
Commercially available cultures from Chr. Hansen A/S, Denmark (HP, HPS9 HP-1, LP, LL~ 2) were analyzed for initial melting point before and after addition of maltodextrin (Glucidex 12 from Roquette Freres, Lestrem, France). The products are sold as frozen pellets, and these should be kept loose which is secured by an initial melting point above the storage temperature.<br>
Aim:<br>
The aim of the present study was to raise the initial melting point above storage temperature in order to obtain loose pellets.<br>
Materials and methods:<br>
i) Materials<br>
Glucidex 12 (Roquette Freres, Lestrem, France) was used as additive compound.<br>
100 g of each of the cultures listed in Table 5 was used. B indicates that glycerine was not    -added to the culture, where as A indicates that 10% v/v glycerine has been added before pellet freezing.<br><br><br>
ii) Recipe for formulation of the samples:<br>
Frozen concentrate cultures were thawed and mixed with the different amounts of a Gfricidex 12 solution to a final formulation of 3.5% to 10.1% (WAV).<br>
The different formulations are listed in Table 6.<br>
iii) Measurement of Tm':<br>
The samples were prepared in 100 µL alumina crucibles. The phase transition curves were recorded on the Mettlet DSG for all the formulations. The samples were inserted to the DSC at -90°C. Scanning temperature program: 7°C/min -100°C - 0°C.<br>
mi) Visual evaluation of melting point of F-DVS R604.<br>
The formulations were pellet-firozen in liquid nitrogen and 100 individual pellets (around 20 -30 g) of pellets were poured into petridishes, thus forming a thin layer of loose single pellets. One sample of each of the formulations was placed at -46°C. After 14 days of storage the samples were examined to see if they were still loose or if the pellets had made clumps or seemed sticky - and if so - their willingness to be shaken into loose panicles again-<br>
Results:<br>
Results of adding maltodextrine (Glucidex 12) to different cultures in various amounts are shown in Figure 1. It is clear that increasing the concentration of maltodextrine increases Tm'. In Table 2 the results on evaluating the stickiness/clumping are listed. Samples with a Tm' above the storage temperature of -46° were loose pellets where as the samples having Tm' below -46°C were sticking together.<br><br>
Table 6: Formulations of samples, Initial melting temperature (Tm') and visual inspection of frozen pellets.<br>
Note to table:<br>
- designates clumped, caked or sticky (less than 20 of the 100 individual pellets remain as loose individual single pellets).<br>
+++ designates Loose particles (at least 90 of the 100 individual pellets remain as loose individual single pellets).<br>
The result is illustrated in table 6 and in fig. 2 and shows that maltodextrin is an effective agent to increase the Tm' in cultures containing 10% v/v glycerine (A-series) as well in cultures not containing glycerine (B-series). This experiment further demonstrates that a well known cryoprotectant (i.e. glycerine) not can be used to increase the physical stability during storage of a pellet-frozen culture.<br><br>
